The number 18 was chosen for its numerological significance, symbolizing success.</p><p>// Note that this *does not mean there will be an auction every 18 minutes.* An auction will only begin when someone is ready to settle the previous auction and place their bid. This allows an engaged potential new member to secure their participation within the group without needing to check back over the next ~24 hours. //</p><p>-The reserve price will be updated to .18 to sync with the auction timing and ensure sustenance of the DAO’s ability to achieve it’s missions.</p><p><br></p><p>Next steps would be to add functionality akin to <a href=\"https://lilblockparty.wtf/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(220, 161, 13);\">https://lilblockparty.wtf/</a> that allows the next bidder to choose their FamilyNoun and add the additional information on settling, bidding, and the FaNounders/Nouns mints to the main auction area of the page (https://lilnouns.wtf/ and https://nouns.wtf/).</p>",
