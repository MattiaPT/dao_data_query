      "content": "In context of the recent success of our stETH market, we will be launching a new maturity for staked ETH assets, and generally also be looking towards adding more staking assets in the future across EVM compatable chains.\n\nThat said, we have a number of growing options for staking partners, many of which would love the opportunity to reduce their exposure to volatility and offer fixed-yield staking.\n\nThe top options are:\n- Lido\n- Frax\n- Rocketpool\n- Ankr\n- Other\n\nFor a brief overview of each, see below:\n\nLido:\nCurrent APY: 5.0%\nTVL: $10.4b\n\nLido is generally seen as the de-facto staking derivative with the vast majority of the market share. That said, the lido APY has not been competitive with the wider market over the recent month.\n\nFrax:\nCurrent APY: 6.37%\nTVL: $221.6m\n\nFrax uses a bifurcated design which ensures stakers always benifet from higher APYs that competitors. The margin stakers benefit from depends on FXS incentives to fraxETH liquidity providers and as such this benefit may not scale over time.\n\nRocketpool:\nCurrent APY: 3.93%\nTVL: $1.12b\n\nRocketpool uses a split design to incentivize the creation of new nodes, however has also seen difficult scalability and non-competitive yields for those not running nodes. That said, rocketpool provides the most sustainable design from a decentralization perspective.\n\nProposal\nWith the context provided above, we are asking the community to identify our ideal staked ETH integration partner (for now), for the immediate relaunch of our stETH or other market launch.\n\nVoting\nYour options will be:\n\nLido stETH\nFrax frxETH\nRocketpool\nWho is the ideal partner for our immediate staked ETH market launch?

      "content": "As a follow up to our governance post: https://gov.swivel.finance/t/sip-008-usdc-market-launch-post-euler\n\nThe Swivel DAO will need to launch a new USDC market in the near future alongside a new integration partner. With this in mind, the core team has identified a number of potential partners, with descriptions available below: \n\nAave (v2):\nCurrent APY: 1.06%\nCurrent TVL: $838m\nAave offers a “safe” solution that has been battle tested for years (and the highest TVL). With this has come superfluous deposits that tend to sit in Aave regardless of the current rates – activity that may be negative while rates are low but positive while rates are high.\n\nCompound (v2)\nCurrent APY: 2.68% + 0.84% COMP\nCurrent TVL: $424.54M\nCompound offers a similarly “safe” solution that has been around the longest in DeFi. Compound seems to offer a competitive APY while also offering additional COMP rewards that may buffer the Swivel DAO treasury over time.\n\nYearn\nCurrent APY: 2.82%\nCurrent TVL: $27m\nYearn offers an aggregated yield source that will generally “always” be competitive with the market, assuming the market doesnt crunch completely (and the yearn fee eclipses what they can offer as an aggregator). Further, as an aggregator Yearn also diversifies their yield origination sources which may be of relevance in context of the recent Euler hack (e.g. Yearn was exposed to Euler but only ~2m if I remember correctly)\n\nMorpho (Compound)\nCurrent APY: 2.77% + .77% COMP + 140 MORPH / 1000 USDC\nCurrent TVL: $7.14m\nMorpho generally always offers equivalent or higher APYs compared to Compound given their P2P layer can offer slight optimization. There is also the additional MORPH tokens which may be of value at some point as well. The downside is if there is little P2P activity, we are taking on the risk of the Morpho layer purely for the MORPH tokens.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nWhich integration partner should we launch our upcoming fixed-rate USDC market alongside?",

This allows for additional contextual lending and aggregation and potential arbitrage between the two over time.\n\nThese maturities also align with FTX’s quarterly futures maturities which provides additional contextual information when compared to potential USDC or other funding yields.",
