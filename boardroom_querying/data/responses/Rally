      "title": "$RLY Network Decentralization ",
      "content": "ABSTRACT\nThis proposal recommends evolving the $RLY ecosystem from a single organization into a new structure with five separate projects: 1) Rally.io, 2) Rally Asia Project (name TBD), 3) $RLY Network Association, 4) $RLY Ecosystem DAO, and 5) SuperLayer Labs.  All five projects share the common connection of being built on, developing or supporting the $RLY protocol. \n\nEach of the projects will have its own budget (totaling $86M USDC / 345M $RLY), and in the case of SuperLayer Labs, the $RLY community will additionally have an investment opportunity ($25M USDC) and provide a credit facility ($20M USDC).  Governance structures designed for each project will enable their success.  Full details of the proposal can be found in this forum post (https://forum.rally.io/t/proposal-rly-network-decentralization/1240/35).\n\nDETAILS\nAs a first step, the non-profit $RLY Network Association will be launched to build and maintain the core blockchain technology, oversee network protocols and rewards, and oversee the $RLY community treasury. Rally.io and the forthcoming Rally Asia Project (a similar project to Rally.io serving the Asian Creator market - name TBD) will be region-specific creator monetization projects that will provide a blueprint for further global creator-focused expansion. Additionally, a venture studio called SuperLayer Labs aimed at supporting the launch of new tokenized consumer products leveraging the $RLY protocol will be unveiled soon. And finally, we propose creating a $RLY Ecosystem DAO, which will be directly run and governed by the $RLY community, that can disburse grants or loans from community funding of the DAO and oversee projects for the broader ecosystem. \n\nWith this new set of decentralized infrastructure in place, the $RLY protocol should become even more attractive for third-party developers, creators, or anyone to build a business on the $RLY protocol without any singular centralized entity or party controlling the ecosystem.\n\nSummary budget (detailed breakdown and release schedule located in forum post):\nRally.io - 150M $RLY and 60M $USDC\nRally Asia - 70M $RLY and 17.5M $USDC\n$RLY Network - 55M $RLY and 6.5M $USDC\n$RLY Ecosystem DAO - 20M $RLY and 2M $USDC\nSuperLayer - 50M $RLY, 20M $USDC credit facility, and opportunity for community to invest up to 25M $USDC in new venture investments that SuperLayer leads\n\n*Note: The 20M $USDC credit facility to SuperLayer is at a five percent (5%) annual interest rate payable annually with a loan term of thirty-six (36) months from the date of tranche draw. \n\nRELEASE SCHEDULE, VOLUME RESTRICTIONS, and REPORTING: \nThe first tranche of funding for each entity will be released within five (5) days of approval of this proposal.  Prior to the approval of the second tranche, Rally.io and Rally Asia will submit their own clear and measurable milestones and/or KPIs to the $RLY Network Association. The milestones and/or KPIs will be quarterly measurables that will be considered for subsequent funding requests in tranches three to five. The release schedule is detailed in the forum post.  \n\nThe granted $RLY will be subject to transfer volume restrictions as determined and set by the $RLY Network Association. A recommendation to the Association will be for all $RLY distributed under the Decentralization proposal to be subject to the below volume restrictions:\n\n*Daily Volume Liquidation Limit by Category:\nVendors - Up to USD$10,000 worth of $RLY\nProject - Up to USD$10,000 worth of $RLY\n\n*Daily volume liquidation limit calculations to use the day’s opening rate based on https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/rally/historical-data/.  \n\nAdherence to volume restrictions will be monitored by the $RLY Network Association.  Any deviation from such restrictions will result in action by the Association.\n\nEach of the Rally.io and Rally Asia projects will provide quarterly reporting on spend and results based on guidelines provided by the $RLY Network Association. Further, each project will provide monthly volume trade activity to the $RLY Network Association to demonstrate compliance with the volume restrictions.\n\n\nA YES vote for this proposal would approve the decentralization plan and associated budgets to be distributed by the Community Treasury Manager per the tranche schedule detailed in the forum post. \n\nA NO vote will reject the decentralization plan. \n",

      "title": "Update to Creator Coin Vesting Schedule",
      "content": "**Summary/Abstract**\n\nOn May 16th of 2021, the Rally Community approved a proposal to create a new linear token bonding curve to complement the sigmoidal curve. The newly proposed (or “expanded”) curve, had updated token supply, slope, and vesting requirements for creator genesis coins.\n\nAfter seeing the performance of the coins launched on the expanded curve over the last few weeks, we believe an update is necessary to the creator genesis coin vesting requirements. The current vesting schedule tends to be too restrictive and does not give the creator a large enough % ownership in their economy, flexibility with free token distribution or stake in potential community activity rewards.\n\nThis proposal recommends the below update to the creator genesis coin vesting schedule. If approved, this vesting schedule change would apply to new creators launched on the expanded curve as well as retroactively to existing creators already on it.\n\n**New Proposed Updated Vesting Schedule for Creator Genesis Coin:**\n - 50k creator coins unlock immediately\n - Additional 3% of supply unlocks each month through end of year 3\n - Vesting begins immediately, no 6 month cliff\n - All coins unlocked in the genesis supply will be subject to flow controls\n - Vesting will also be capped so a creator won’t vest more than 30% of the total circulating supply at any point (i.e. in order to unlock all 5MM coins in the genesis supply, creator must garner enough support for 16.7MM+ coins in circulation.)\n\n**Forum post for reference:**\n \nhttps://forum.rally.io/t/proposal-expanded-tbc-vesting-schedule/1190\n\n**Proposal**\n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would approve the updates to the vesting schedule as outlined above.\n\nA No vote would result in rejection of this proposal.\n\n",

      "content": "This proposal recommends allocating up to $1,704,000 from the Rally Community Treasury to be spent on the adoption of tools and services for a 12 month period, in order to fund engineering and development, security, and scalability/performance priorities to get the Rally infrastructure ready for the next phase of growth. Key areas of focus include:\n - Monitoring and Alerting\n - Load and Stress Testing\n - DevOps Consulting\n - Economic Alerting & Monitoring\n - Anti botting / Fraud detection\n - Mobile Application(s)\n\nPlease review the Discourse forum discussion for full details, a breakdown of the total budget, and an in-depth community discussion: https://forum.rally.io/t/proposal-rally-infrastructure-engineering-funding-request/1114\n \n**Summary/Abstract:**\nThe budget requested would be to cover a 12 month period for the following areas:\n\nMonitoring and Alerting: This proposal recommends engaging DataDog, currently in use on a trial basis. Funding will enable additional instrumentation to enable improvement of code and infrastructure and to provide insight into Rally systems without major engineering work.  Requested budget required for this tool: $144,000 (12 months)\n\nLoad and Stress Testing: This funding will enable build/outsource of a comprehensive suite of load/stress tests to discover bottlenecks and ensure various parts of the Rally infrastructure system can handle load end to end.  Requested budget required for such tools: $180,000 (12 months)\n\nDevOps Consulting: Foghorn consulting (specifically FogOps) is recommended to supplement existing DevOps engineering efforts to audit Rally systems for security and performance and ensure Rally is using the latest technologies and best practices.  Requested budget required for this tool: $288,000 (12 months)\n\nEconomic Alerting and Monitoring: This spend is recommended for economic alerting and monitoring of value fluctuations and calculations. Quantiphi is an AWS partner that could help with Data Engineering and AI/ML and help set up the data infrastructure.  Requested budget required for this engagement: $432,000 (12 months)\n\nAnti botting / Fraud detection: Addressing bots and fraud is a high priority for Rally and the community. Investing in the right tools can help detect or mitigate against use of bots to commit fraud, and fraud detection tools can help detect and prevent bad behavior and not allow a few bad actors to affect the entire community.  Requested budget required for such tools: $180,000 (12 months)\n\nMobile Application(s): Developing mobile apps would help the spread the use and adoption of Rally and help with MFA, providing more security within the Rally ecosystem.  Certain use cases for creator coins can be a separate app, or an app that allows creators to white label their own apps to manage their own coins/ NFTs within their community.  Requested budget required for such tools: $480,000 (12 months)\n\n**Total requested estimated budget for 12 months: $1,704,000**\n\n**Proposal**\n\n - **A Yes vote would approve the budget and spending outlined above, based on the rationale outlined in this proposal and the associated Discourse discussion.**\n\n - **A No vote would result in rejection of this proposal.**\n \n \n",

      "content": "Bonfire has been an engaged member of the Rally developer community for months. Matt Alston and Melissa Zhang are active almost daily in the Discord Developer Channel. They have shown real commitment to building Bonfire with creators’ needs in mind, and they have amazing and relevant backgrounds from Coinbase and Uber in engineering and product.\n\nThis proposal is designed to reward the first fulltime, outside venture funded business building on top of Rally Network and accelerate their work. The PR and communication of this grant will be designed to bring other developers into the ecosystem by giving investors further confidence that their capital will be amplified by the community as we grow the early ecosystem.\n\nHere’s a demo video for their product that is live already:\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/fcabe360eace49bfbc87e8e8c12ac409\n\nThe Discourse thread where this proposal has been actively debated is found at:\nhttps://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104\n\nThe team's published roadmap is here:\nhttps://www.notion.so/31e4f8e2e88b4541a20950398bc87387?v=f5bffb5096924e44b334d665ebdde7a4\n\nThe proposal is for 500K $RLY tokens with a 6 month linear vest.  \n\nThere are well argued pros/cons of this proposal that can be found here:\nPros mentioned:\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/2\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/8\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/15\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/16\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/22\n\nCons mentioned:\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/21\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/5\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/5\n* https://forum.rally.io/t/proposals-bonfire-developer-grant-rallydao-initial-funding/1104/15\n\nIt's noted that there are many quite reasonable requests to add more structure, KPI or milestone-based funding mechanisms, reporting or reduced proposal share. Taking into consideration the lack of a DAO organization to run administrative duties, this proposal adds a 6 month vesting period that is easy to administer and mitigates (mildly) some of the issues discussed.\n\nThis proposal vote does not approve a proper RallyDAO, but instead will kick off work aligned with other progressive decentralization work the initial development team is working on. The RallyDAO would empower the community further to set these matters with more effective governance tools that have come to market since the Rally launch.\n\nWe look forward to RLY token holders' vote on this matter.\n\n\n",

      "content": "Summary Abstract\n\nThis proposal would give a 30-40K $RLY grant to a member of the Rally community, Paul, to co-author a whitepaper alongside Kevin and other members of the core development team. Budget is time-and-materials based at 200 $RLY an hour, with the reference amount the anticipated range. Paul anticipates wrapping up the final version in September.\n\nPaul and Kevin started a forum thread here last week that has received positive feedback: https://forum.rally.io/t/proposal-rally-whitepaper/1049\n\nBackground\nThe Rally Network has not had a whitepaper due to the substantial amount of work to launch the network and short staffing of the project at launch. The core team and community on Discord/Discourse regularly are asked for a link to a whitepaper by newcomers to Rally. The core team has always wanted to develop a proper whitepaper, but has lacked the bandwidth and the proper expertise to create a paper we can all be proud of as a community.\n\nThe Rally community is expected to benefit in several ways from this initiative:\n* Crypto community, technologists, analysts, media, potential business partners, developers and of course creators can have a definitive whitepaper to reference\n* The whitepaper will be a living document that can be updated over time as the network evolves\n* Several new projects are underway, and the core team can work with Paul to capture these projects in the whitepaper\n\n\nProposal\nThis proposal will grant Paul 200 $RLY an hour from the Community Treasury to develop the project described above. The anticipated budget will be 30-40K $RLY.\n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would approve the payment of this grant. A No vote would result in rejection of this proposal.",

      "title": "Grant Request: New Media Opportunity to Help Grow the Rally Creator and Social Token Economy",
      "content": "**Summary Abstract**\n\nThis proposal would help to accelerate the creation of a new media organization that fills a significant gap in the creator economy and impedes growth, particularly for creators using social tokens. It will bring more focus to Rally creators, drive market education about creator coins, enlist increased support for creator coin economics from brands, and drive attention from mainstream media. It will be a building block to support other efforts already underway by the Rally marketing team and the recently approved liquidity program. Finally, it will be led by a Rally community member and help directly impact metrics important to the network such as new creator recruitment, creator success, and the rapid scaling of market awareness and consumer participation.\n\nThis proposal has been discussed at length in the forum. For the full discussion, please review the Discourse forum posts here: https://forum.rally.io/t/proposal-new-media-opportunity-that-can-help-grow-the-rally-creator-and-social-token-economy/1018\n\n\n**Background**\nBret Kinsella is the creator of $BOT Coin which grew out of his work founding Voicebot.ai and Voicebot Research. Those organizations established the central source for data, news, and analysis for the growing voice AI community in 2016. They served to educate the market and bring together entrepreneurs, tech giants, and consumer brands to grow the industry collaboratively. Several Rally creators recognized that a similar solution could benefit the creator economy in general and the Rally Network and Rally creators in particular. \n\nThe project will consist of an online publication, podcast, and research organization that will cultivate audiences among creators, consumer brand marketers, and other news media. This is not a $BOT Coin project but instead is designed to support all Rally creators and the network as a whole. \n\nThe new organization will not be limited to covering Rally as it will be important to draw a larger audience that is generally interested in the business and technology of the creator economy. This will give the areas of focus around Rally greater reach. However, the proposed funding from Rally is requested to accelerate the program and build out the Rally-specific elements so the impact can be generated sooner. \n\n**The Rally community is expected to benefit in several ways from this initiative:**\n- Generate more awareness for Rally creators among brands and other organizations with budgets for influencer marketing campaigns that could be integrated with creator coin projects\n- Generate more awareness for Rally creators among media by providing a platform for independent exposure through a specialist media and research organization that backs analysis with concrete data\n- Provide an independent source of information about Rally that can help educate businesses, media, and others\n- Provide resources for creators to help them better manage and add value to their coin economies\n- Raise awareness among creators that Rally is an attractive option for building their businesses and enlisting them before they choose alternative social token solution\n \nBret Kinsella and his organization EdgeLens LLC are particularly well suited to deliver these benefits because of their experience building Voicebot.ai, past experience hiring and collaborating with dozens of creators/influencers, and in-depth knowledge of Rally. If approved, the project will begin in June 2021. More details are provided in the forum discussion. \n\n**Metrics**\nTo provide visibility to the Rally community, EdgeLens will publish summary metrics and activities in the Rally Discord on at least a quarterly basis related to growth, Rally-related resources, and Rally exposure. Bret Kinsella will also host an online discussion after the first three months to discuss the project and field questions from the community.  \n\n**Proposal**\nThis proposal will grant EdgeLens LLC 16k $RLY per month for six months from the Community Treasury to develop the project described above. \n\n**A Yes vote for this proposal would approve the payment of this grant. A No vote would result in rejection of this proposal.**\n",

The platform's infrastructure only allows for donations and doesn't give creators the power to monetize their content.\n\nRally creators are often faced with a challenge: convincing their fans (who are often not as well versed in the crypto space) to pay cash for a digital coin when most other creators offer them physical goods (merch, limited edition items, etc).\n\n**The Solution**\n\nGating Clubhouse rooms with creator coins. This lets creators monetize their rooms and incentivizes fans to buy their coins and hold them over a long time frame.\n\n**An Example**\n\n-   Jeremiah Owyang (JOW) creates a room with [paidrooms.ch 3](http://paidrooms.ch/). The topic is \"Come pitch your startups\" - he'll offer feedback on startup pitches and will potentially keep in touch with the founders if he hears a good pitch.\n\n-   He sets the minimum number of coins held to join the room to 10.\n\n-   Founders who see the asymmetric upside in attending his room buy 10 coins and sign up.\n\n-   The founders who attended can choose to sell their coins afterward, but recognize that Jeremiah will be hosting more gated rooms in the future and since they gained a ton of value from the session, will hold onto them.\n\nSince the rooms are gated, fewer people attend overall compared to average rooms, which makes the setting more intimate. Often there are journalists or unwelcomed guests in public rooms, but with gated ones, the host knows that each attendee is one of their supporters, so they are more open and authentic in conversation.\n\n**Initial Stats**\n\nHere are a few stats so far:\n\n      Views (home) = 5986\n\n      Rooms started = 231 (room info was filled out but the user did not sign up)\n\n      Rooms created = 56 (user signed up and the room was created successfully)\n\n      Rooms that went live = 17\n\nWe're hoping that with a bit of funding and support from the Rally community, we can get this in the hands of more creators.\n\n**Future Plans**\n\nWe want to help creators understand their core audience and engage with their top supporters. The platform currently lets creators make rooms, track payments, send their attendees SMS messages, and partner with co-hosts. We plan on building out more Rally functionality within the platform, like being able to purchase rooms with creator coins and give live donations. We also plan on building out a robust set of analytics so that creators can track their top supporters and the rooms that are most engaging. With enough data from different types of creators, we can start making automated suggestions on room types and their pricing.\n\n**Funding**\n\n-   The cost of hosting the platform is ~$130/mo\n\n-   The cost of paying our engineer is ~$50/hr. With big changes being made to the platform over the next month he will be working ~130hrs. Those updates include adding the ability to purchase access to a room with creator coins (as opposed to how gating functions currently with a minimum required coin count) and implementing the ability for audience members to give donations and get rewards live (i.e being brought up to the stage).\n\n-   Afterward, we would just do maintenance and update the platform based on feedback from Rally creators. This would be in the ball-park of ~40hrs of engineering work for the month.\n\n**Total cost for the next two months = 130x2 + 50x120 + 50x40 = $8760 in RLY**\n\nThese next two months will be a recursive process of approximating PMF with the help of feedback from creators. We will be closely monitoring their usage and any friction points they experience while using the platform. We will also be getting input on which additions would be most useful to implement (i.e. room analytics, RLY donation sounds, etc).\n\n**The Impact on Rally**\n\nThere are 26 active Rally creators Clubhouse. Many of them own large clubs or are influential members of large clubs (Wellness Club (19.4K), Talk Club (139K), Human Behaviour (503K), Womxn in Business Club (320K), Startup Club (481K), Cash in your story (25.4K), etc).\n\nLet's assume each creator hosts 1 room per week and each room gets an average of 100 attendees.\n\nLet's also assume 10% of their audience would engage with gated rooms.\n\n      26 creators * 8 weeks * 10 attendees = 2080 attendees\n\nLet's also assume that on average, attendees must buy 10 coins to join these rooms.\n\n      2080 attendees * 10 coins = 20800 coins\n\nBased on today's coin prices, the average creator coin for these 26 creators is ~$5.50.\n\n      20800 coins * $5.50 = $114400\n\nWe also believe that the network effects of introducing 2080 people to Rally could be much larger, as they might be inclined to purchase coins from other creators on the platform or tell their friends about Rally. Since that is difficult to quantify, we won't include it in the calculation, but it could have ripple effects on the coin valuations of other creators.\n\n**Proposal**\n\n**This proposal will grant Gensight $8760 in $RLY from the previously allocated $RLY for developer grants and bounties to develop the creator tools described above.**\n\n**A Yes vote for this proposal would approve the payment of this developer grant of $8760 in $RLY to Gensight.**\n\n**A No vote would result in rejection of this proposal.**",

      "content": "**Proposal**\nThis proposal recommends the allocation of a maximum total of 35M $RLY in the form of loans and grants to fund the $RLY liquidity strategies designed by Miguel Vias, the Rally community-appointed markets specialist engaged to identify liquidity strategies for $RLY in support of the community’s interests.\n\nThe below proposal summarizes key rationale behind the spend - please review the Discourse forum discussion for full details and community discussion: https://forum.rally.io/t/liquidity-strategy-budget-proposal-and-community-governance/990\n \n**Summary/Abstract:**\nGrowing liquidity for the Rally Network is a priority for the Rally community in order to support the creator economies on which the community is focused.  The Discourse forum discussion noted above explains in greater detail the reasons why liquidity is necessary, which types of partners we’ll need to engage to grow liquidity, in which capacity we will engage those partners, how we’ll measure success, and lastly, the budget necessary to be successful.\n\nTo properly engage with the partners, and progress the metrics, outlined in the Discourse discussion, a very high-level budget request for the following 12 months is outlined below, consisting of up to a maximum total of 35M $RLY, to be deployed as follows:\n\n Loans: $RLY deployed in the form of loans to centralized exchange market maker partners enable these key market players to provide consistent two sided markets.\n - Amount of allocation: 60-70% of total budget\n - Loans may contain embedded options to sell $RLY\n - Loan terms to be no longer than 12 months\n\nEducation/Marketing: $RLY deployed to exchange-specific education and marketing programs relating to the token are generally required by key exchanges. \n - Amount of allocation: 30-40% of total budget\n - $RLY will be returned to community if not used\n\nMost of the budget is composed of loans which will be repaid either in $RLY or USD depending on the terms required by the relevant partners, and the educational/marketing spend will be returned if initiatives are not executed or are unsuccessful. \n\n**Proposal for review**\nThis proposal, if passed, will effectuate the following actions:\n\n**1. Approve $RLY Allocation**\nApprove up to a maximum total of 35M $RLY, to be deployed in the form of Loans and Education/Marketing initiatives as outlined above.  All loaned $RLY (or equivalent value) will be returned to the community, and all unused/unsuccessful education and marketing funds will likewise be returned.\n\n**2. Community Oversight and Governance**\nAdopt the following structure for community oversight and governance of this spend:\n - Quarterly report delivered to the community at the end of each calendar quarter (end of June and September, 2021)\n - Quarterly community calls to review the report and collect community feedback on progress, spend, and strategy.\n\n**3. Appoint Community Agent**\nMiguel Vias is appointed to act as the Rally community’s agent for purposes of identifying and vetting partners, vendors and exchanges, and overseeing and managing relationships with selected partners, vendors and exchanges.  As the community’s agent, he will be authorized to sign necessary contracts and documentation on behalf of the community, and if appropriate and necessary, to appoint an appropriate legal entity/counterparty to sign necessary documentation on behalf of the Rally community.\n\n**Proposal**\n\n**A Yes vote would approve the proposal outlined above, based on the rationale outlined in this proposal and the associated Discourse discussion.**\n\n**A No vote would result in rejection of this proposal.**\n",

      "content": "**Abstract**\nThis proposal recommends engaging Miguel Vias for the development of liquidity growth strategies for the Rally network. \n\n**Details**\nMiguel Vias is a payments and cryptocurrency markets expert particularly focused on developing liquidity growth strategies for early-stage products and projects. He recently served as Head of XRP Markets at Ripple, where he managed a team that drove XRP liquidity growth, as well as the adoption of the company’s flagship remittance product, the first ever to commercially use a digital currency as a bridge asset. Before Ripple he was in charge of the precious metals product team at CME Group, the largest derivatives exchange in the world. Miguel currently sits on the Board of Directors of Digital Asset Management and is an advisor to Addigy and Linqto, where he helps with liquidity growth for the platform’s offerings.\n\nMiguel is interested in lending his expertise to open up new strategies for Rally to drive its liquidity and growth. His network is massive, and his knowledge of the cryptocurrency payments space, crypto market strategies, and drivers for growth is powerful and unique. His collaboration with the Rally network would be instrumental for the community’s growth.\n\nCheck out his intro video and full the Discourse discussion here: \nhttps://forum.rally.io/t/community-engagement-proposal-miguel-vias-for-liquidity-growth-strategies/942\n\nThe proposed engagement terms will be as follows:\n\n - 166,667 $RLY per month for a period of 5 months from Advisors and Collaborators pool, plus $25K USDC per month from the Rally community treasury.\n - Full-time focus on Rally.\n - During this period, KPIs will be established and achievements will be shared with the community for review.\n - At the end of the 5 month period, unless the community and Miguel would like to renew the engagement, the intention is for this advisory arrangement to end.\n\n **A YES vote for this proposal would approve Miguel Vias to assist the Rally network with liquidity growth strategies based on the terms detailed above.**\n\n**A NO vote will result in no engagement.**\n\n",

With his key executive and leadership roles at companies like Tabuan Group, AEG Presents, Live Nation, Radical Media, Ticketmaster and 247tickets, Robb has been able to define and execute strategies for live music, festivals, sports and digital media experiences around the world. Part of his expertise stems from his understanding of the international entertainment industry, including cultural nuances for content and entertainment consumption in each territory across Asia, India and the Middle East. He has led diverse, cross-functional teams working with superstar artists like Ed Sheeran, Shawn Mendes, Beyoncé, Katy Perry, Maroon 5, Coldplay, Sam Smith, BIG BANG and Imagine Dragons to connect them meaningfully with their worldwide fan base.\n \nRobb is passionate about helping creators capitalize on technology innovations to develop new revenue streams, and that’s where things get exciting for Rally. As one of the Rally network’s core missions is to empower creators to build and own their customized digital economies, global audiences are a huge factor in expanding the Rally community beyond anything we’ve previously been able to do. Due to the unique business and cultural characteristics of overseas markets, it will require an expert to facilitate these efforts - and Robb is well positioned to help the Rally network get there.  \n \nHis collaboration with Rally would enable the community to effectively engage audiences throughout Asia, India, the Middle East, and beyond. He would advise on international strategy, compliance and payment structures, international talent and platform partnerships, people strategy and all elements of go-to-market priorities at an international scale.  \n\nCheck out his intro video and full the Discourse Discussion here: https://forum.rally.io/t/community-engagement-proposal-robb-spitzer-for-international-expansion/894/10\n\nThe advisory arrangement is as follows:\n\n - 166,666 $RLY per month for a period of 6 months from Advisors and Collaborators pool, plus $25K USDC per month from the Rally community treasury.\n - Full-time focus on Rally.\n - During this period, KPIs will be established and achievements will be shared with the community for review.\n - At the end of the 6 month period, the community will have the opportunity to evaluate the engagement and, if the community decides to extend the engagement, it can do so through a new proposal. \n\n **A YES vote for this proposal would approve Robb Spitzer to be engaged to enable international expansion of the the Rally network based on the terms detailed above.**\n\n**A NO vote will result in no engagement.**\n\n\n",

      "content": "Proposal\nPrevious: https://snapshot.org/#/rally/proposal/QmX4RvUHKxMehPB3TB2wgFsVpy16zjwgRGnkHHgt2JKK6u\n\nOn Mar 14, the Rally Community voted to approve of the Creator Review Council (CRC) to represent the Community in reviewing of candidates for Creator Coins. The CRC replaces the use of Snapshot proposals for individual Creator Coin candidates.\n\nIn keeping with our ethos of Community Governance, we decided on the following course of action:\n\n1. All community candidates are listed in this single Rally Snapshot proposal. Candidates are listed by Preferred Name and a short bio (4 sentences max).\n2. Voters will select a single candidate. (Snapshot voting does not allow for multi-selection.)\n3. The voting process will last 72 hours. After 72 hours, the 3 candidates with the highest aggregate scores will be named to the Creator Review Council, along with 2 members of Rally Staff, for a total number of 5 CRC members.\n\nHere are the finalists (in order of submission):\n\nVooka\nI was led to Rally as a fan initially, by TMFA (been a big fan of Matty Mo for a while now). I consume everything Rally-related: forums, snapshot proposals, the team's social feeds, and of course everything on the Discord server. I'm very familiar with twitch and the communities there and I'm also immersed in hype geek culture which doesn't apply to all creators but will certainly be useful when analyzing creators for the younger crowds. I believe I would have a unique insight when judging which early creators would excel on the platform and whether or not they should be prioritized over others.\n\nMatt MacDonald ($CRIME coin)\nI've been independently releasing albums via Kickstarter since 2011, and I've successfully funded over two dozen Kickstarter projects for other creators, and I've never had a project go unfunded. I believe in the promise of Rally for creators like myself and others in my circle. In my years of helping launch Kickstarters and build release marketing plans for independent musicians and creators, I've sharpened my ability to assess 1.) A creators actual reach and engagement and 2.) Track record and willingness to do what is necessary to succeed. I think I can offer these skills to Rally, and I would love to be part of the process of onboarding other creators.\n\nRainRaith\nHello, my name is Jacqueline, mainly known as RainRaith on the forum and Discord! I have been an active member of this community since early February and as someone who is not a developer or marketing specialist, it is my hope that being a member of this review council will allow me to contribute to this community as best as I can. My passion in the creator space has mainly resided in the streaming community where I moderate and interact with many small-time streamers; this is in addition to my professional experience in the biochemical research field, both of which are experiences I aim to utilize in this position. On a personal note, I am keenly interested in the flourishing of inclusivity and diversity in this novel and innovative space, and I would love to be allowed to bring the unique perspective I have to Rally’s review process.\n\nSIXYmofo\nAs many of you have seen from my input on the forums, I have pushed for this type of process as it will free up time for the team to focus building the dream.  When I vote on a creator,  I take a deep dive before I cast my vote.   This has helped me see some of the positives/negatives of our recent selections.   My background is building teams,  Defi enthusiast and a true believer in Rally.   I hope I can count on your vote to be one of the 3 selected.      \n\nRolf\nRolf is a member of Metacartel Venture DAO, a community by, of, and for builders in crypto. He also runs Numomo, one of the world's first Creative NFT Agencies. Rolf previously co-founded several token ventures that raised significant funding, including Savvy, a blockchain robo-advisor, and Keyless, which enables secure log-ins without a password. Rolf holds a PhD from INSEAD, where he wrote his PhD dissertation on valuing tokens.\n\nAngel#3191\nMy name is Angelica Dunkley. I am an investor of the platform, a liquidity provider on Uniswap and a frequent member to your Discord/forums. I have been a HUGE fan of social tokens since 2017 when I was first introduced to a blockchain company their aim was to give the ordinary individual a token where they can to interact with fans/community quite similar to what the Rally team are doing. I recently discovered Rally and I want to be involved more than buying the Rally token. I do not have the typical technology background, my background is Law and I am investor of bitcoin and Ethereum since 2017. I am based in western Canada and would also love to spread the word of Rally to Canadians at large.\n\nArtAboveReality\nBadir McCleary is an independent consultant. He holds an M.A. in Arts Business from Sotheby’s Institute of Art (Los Angeles/London) where he focused on creating art markets and with an undergraduate degree in Internet Computing from Cabrini University focusing on e-commerce and digital trends. Badir enjoys working with artists and consider them crucial to informing his practice. Having extensive contemporary art history knowledge and experience, Badir is able to tackle large projects with confidence, protecting and tracking deliverables and ensuring high-level success for clients. \n\nPhelpsGG\nI’m interested in helping identify creators that will be good ambassadors of the rally platform. \n\nMbeezy\nI am a marketing professional with over 7 years of experience and I have been involved with the Rally community since November 2020. I've applied for marketing positions within Rally and stay up to date in Discord and social channels. I am a strong believer in Rally and the Creators and would be honored to have any position within the Rally team working with like minded individuals in this new space. I greatly appreciate your consideration. \n\nGary Henderson ($GARY coin)\nGary Henderson is the creator behind Gary.club and the $GARY coin!  Over the past several years he's helped creators like Lewis Howes, Jeff Walker, Gabby Bernstein, Michael Hyatt, Dr Axe and many others build their creator economy!  Gary's currently writing a book about using the social audio app Clubhouse to build your Creator Economy!\n\nChaosed\nIn early March I wrote a detailed analysis of Rally that was well-received by Kevin Chou. I have a thorough understanding of social media, I recently started a YouTube channel called Bytesize Finance, I've streamed on Twitch, frequent Twitter & Instagram and my girlfriend is -deep- into TikTok. On top of that, my understanding of Rally is rock solid especially in terms of tokenomics. I've been involved in the crypto space for nearly six years writing reviews, analyzing technological developments and taking positions in potentially disruptive projects. \n\nJeppe_HS\nI am a firm believer in Rally and an early adopter. I have taken interest due to Nicholena and have explored Rally for months now. Recently I found very inspiring creators through Rally, and I feel it is important to keep the balance for Rally and protect the brand from any creators we would not want on the platform. I am very analytic, thorough and always like to help people get set up, answer questions and be someone who can be relied on.\n\nBigsc\nI’ve sat as a trustee on various boards for pensions and health and welfare. I’ve participated on many votes factoring in all relevant information at hand. I have a sound voice and am fair. I sit at the age range between boomers, millennials and Gen Z, where I can understand and relate to different types of creators and their work.\n\nAlberts#6012\nMy name is Zachary Alberts and I am a manufacturing Analyst at Georgia-Pacific (Koch Industries). Georgia pacific has instilled Market-Based Management in me, which is a culture that enables organizations to succeed in the long term by applying principles that allow free societies to prosper. I would be honored to apply the same principles to the Rally community in the form of a creator Review council member. My education is listed on my LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/zalberts/\n\nGrandMarquis\nI've been an active contributor to the Rally community since its inception. I'm the most active writer on the discourse forums, #1 across all categories. I work hard to think about ways that Rally can better serve creators and their fans, even reaching out directly to creators to better understand their needs. I'd gratefully serve the community of creators and rly holders as part of the council in this role.\n\nhammy#6924\nFundamentally, Rally is about helping creators grow and helping bring their audiences alongside them. However, the existence of this council is based on the fact that not all creators have the same community that Rally strives to assist. As someone who was born in the 2000s, I have a strong intuition about a lot of creators that aim to appeal to the younger generation (I use TikTok regularly, for example). My being part of the Creator Review Council exists primarily in being an alternate viewpoint, a voice for those that make up the majority of the community, but don't have as powerful of a voice.\n\nPilotVietnam\nLong time member with non-biased insight on how the Creator process works, and the tools they require to be successful creators.\n\nMadMikeBLVD#8154\nI'm a network engineer, solutions architect by trade. I am a long term BTC/ETC Mine operator. ETH 2.0 stalker. I am holding, using, promoting the use of creator coins and UNI RLY/ETH staking.\n\nJustin Finkelstein\nI believe Creator Coins are the future of economic transactions for people who create work that does not fit into a tiny box. I am most excited about helping creators who do not have large audiences and intend to have a coin myself. I was introduced to to Rally about a month ago through the CMO launch. I want to be part of this process to help accelerate and support new creators.",

The GGC aims to create a community that fosters friendships, collaboration, and innovation within the gaming industry. Our goal is pretty simple: play golf, meet new people, have fun. We are professionals at the cutting edge of tech and would plan to incorporate our token as our primary method for membership, green fees, and special sponsorships.\n\nUse Cases:\nLaunch Adoption - We will be awarding tokens to the teams and players winning our monthly invitational, longest drive, and longest putt contests.\nHolding Mechanics - Consideration for the GGI will be gated by coin holding, and access to events inside the GGC Open will have a coin requirement as well. \nTransaction - Green fees and memberships will be charged via our token, in addition to special add-on events like re-antes into the 'longest putt' contest.\n\nEst. Monthly Tx Revenue: $5000+\n\nGift Coin Treasury Grant\n$2000\n\nA yes will approve this prop and a $2000 gift coin grant\nA no will deny this prop\n",

The trio spent the fall of 2016 in a flurry of productivity, dropping mixes \"Victoria,\" \"Undone,\" and \"Sheath\" in quick succession, all three projects notable in their seductive, low-lit production and extended running times, none under ten minutes long. Gaining momentum and buzz from this initial blast of particularly uniform releases, Sonder followed up in the early months of 2017 with the seven-song EP Into, dialing back the song lengths and switching styles somewhat from the smokescreen haze of their early output, opting for a more direct sound that nodded to the production of '90s R&B innovators like Timbaland and Ginuwine.\n\nUse Cases \nDistribution - Launching discord around the first bunch of coins for merchandise purchase around new release of music.\nHolding - Give coin holders first dibs on purchasing merch, vinyls etc \nTransacting - Transact coin to unlock premium experiences on the Discord and within the community\n\nGrant - $1,000\n\nA 'yes' approves Sonder and a $1,000 treasury grant\nA 'no' denies this proposal.",

Clothia is a curated online marketplace showcasing the best emerging fashion designers in the accessible luxury category located at www.clothia.com.  \n\nPurpose\nThe funding will be used to pay for developer integration work on Clothia’s side to integrate Rally’s API and provide the first major ecommerce site that works with a global community of fashion creators that will integrate Creator Coin as well as Rally’s upcoming NFT platform.  As part of this proposal, Clothia will also launch a $CLOTHIA coin.\n\nElena Silenok, the founder/CEO of Clothia, is very crypto savvy and intent on working with Rally across several dimensions.  Aside from a Clothia coin and Rally/Clothia ecommerce integrations (pay with Clothia coin), in the future she also wants to explore sub-coins for various fashion designers, as well as NFTs.  \n\nWorking with Clothia is a great way for Rally to test the fashion market while also advancing ecommerce integration case studies. \n\nCoin Rollout Plan\nDistribution:\nPhase 1 - reward coins as a 1% cashback to users.  \nPhase 2 - Integrate Rally account into Clothia account.  Users can buy Clothia coins on Rally.io and then use them on Clothia.com\n\nHolding:\nPhase 1 - VIP status tier for holding a certain amount of coin.  Holder receives either faster shipping, priority customer service, concierge / white glove service, discount codes, or something similar\nPhase 2 -  Dynamically display badge on Clothia profile, holder leaderboards \n\nTransactions:\nPhase 1 - N/A (requires integration work)\nPhase 2 - Special designers do coin-only sales \n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would approve this developer grant for Clothia. \n\nA No vote for this proposal would result in no change.\n",

Additionally he helped grow a larger talent management company which at one point represented over 100 artists and creators. Prior to that he held a number of roles at Live Nation / Ticketmaster, Variety Magazine and SONY Music Entertainment. He has been named a 'Trendsetter to Watch' by Digital Media Wire and one of Billboard's 30 under 30.\n\nNews article: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-04-19/the-celebrity-techsplainer-of-beverly-hills\n\nPurpose\nAbe is part of just a handful of folks in the world who can help Rally access the largest and most influential culture tastemakers, celebrities and creators.  The market for social tokens and NFTs  is moving very quickly and getting this level of talent onto Rally at this stage will be a game changer for the Rally Community.  Put another way, NOT getting this type of talent on at this stage could be extremely detrimental for the future of Rally.

      "content": "**Summary/Abstract:**\nProposal to approve a $9.0M marketing budget for the remainder of 2021 to support the Rally Network’s growth and go-to-market strategies.\n \nThe below proposal summarizes key rationale behind the spend - please review the Discourse forum discussion for full details and community discussion: https://forum.rally.io/t/go-to-market-strategy-budget-proposal-and-community-governance/695/8\n \n \n**Background:**\nThe time is NOW for the Rally community to invest heavily in go-to-market strategies. The Rally community is in a unique position to drive Rally to be a ubiquitous name in the creator, fan and crypto communities.  Following an in-depth review and audit of the Rally Network’s activities and achievements from launch through present by Bremner Morris, the Rally community-appointed go-to-market strategist, key opportunities have been identified that can enable the Rally Network to grow exponentially.  This growth is dependent on the Rally community’s approval of this proposal to adopt a full marketing budget to fund go-to-market strategies and initiatives, outlined in the Discourse discussion and below.  \n\nThe Rally community needs to focus on building messaging and marketing programs that appeal to Rally’s three separate audiences: creators, consumers and crypto enthusiasts, as well as focus on creator categories with large total addressable markets and creator and fan communities who are open to adopting new technologies for monetization and engagement. Target categories are: \n\n - Music\n - Video\n - Podcast\n - Gaming\n - Fine Art\n - Entertainment\n - Social Audio\n - Sports\n\nBuilding off of the above successes, the Rally community has the opportunity to scale up go-to-market efforts through the following initiatives: \n\n - Develop our brand message. \n - Define the target creator profile. \n - Build a proactive creator outreach strategy.\n - Develop an inbound funnel. \n - Produce content that educates and inspires core audiences. \n - Build a self-service funnel. \n - Initiate product and network marketing. \n - Develop a steady stream of owned events. \n - Participate in industry events. \n - Invest in talent partnerships and ambassadorships. \n - Scale up our community engagement and education. \n - Invest in our creator’s success. \n - Expand our investment in PR & Media. \n - Launch internationally.\n\n**PROPOSAL**\n**1. Approve Marketing Budget**\n\nApproval of this proposal will approve a total marketing budget of $9.0 million, which is designed to effectuate the brand and go-to-market strategies outlined above for the rest of 2021.  These funds will be paid for in a combination of USD cash and tokens, both from the community partnerships allocation and from the community treasury, as appropriate. This spend will be spread across the following buckets of expense: \n\n*Brand Marketing Foundation: $1.5 million*\n - Brand agency work\n - Website update\n - UX / UI updates\n - Creator Partnerships collateral development\n\n*Marketing Campaigns: $3.5 million*\n - Grow brand awareness through integrated campaigns across events, content, paid digital spend, etc.\n\n*Content Marketing: $250,000*\n - Video content \n - Blog content\n - Wiki content\n - Email newsletters \n - Social media\n - Sponsored content\n\n*Event Marketing: $500,000*\n - Owned and operated events\n - Event sponsorship (e.g. VidCon)\n\n*Talent Agency and Ambassador Partnerships: $600,000*\n\n*PR & Media Relations: $600,000*\n\n*Tools & Infrastructure: $1,500,000*\n - CRM\n - Marketing automation\n - Website platform\n - Self-serve funnel\n\n*Other marketing activities as identified throughout the course of the year: $550,000* \n\nFor certain large budget items (e.g. brand marketing agency), this proposal will authorize Rally Network, Inc. to fund the first 2 - 3 months of spend.  Following an initial review period, such agencies will be assessed and, if appropriate, included in the community budget and retained for presentation to the community (see item 2 below). \n\n**2. Community Oversight and Governance**\n\nThe following structure will be adopted to enable community oversight and governance of this spend:\n\n - Quarterly report delivered to the community at the end of each calendar quarter (end of June, September and December, 2021)\n - Quarterly community calls in connection with each report to review the report and discuss community feedback, shifts in strategy, understand spend and ROI\n - The community will hold the ability, where possible, to exercise a 30 day notice (via approval of Snapshot proposal) to terminate a partner or vendor contract or a specific area of spend following each quarterly report, so that the community can determine if and where these expenditures might not be yielding satisfactory results.\n - Additional monthly reports and updates will be shared as appropriate.\n\n**3. Appoint Community Agent and Community Representative**\n\nBremner Morris will be appointed to act as the Rally community’s agent for purposes of identifying and vetting partners and vendors, in coordination with community members, creators and key stakeholders, and overseeing and managing relationships with selected partners and vendors.  \n\nAs appropriate and necessary to execute on partner and vendor contracts with a legal entity/counterparty to effectuate ministerial tasks on behalf of the Rally community, Rally Network, Inc., or alternate corporate entity accepting assignment of such duties, will be appointed to act as the Rally community’s representative to execute such contracts and effectuate ministerial duties on behalf of the Rally community. \n \n**A Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:**\nApprove the proposals outlined above, based on the rationale outlined in this proposal and the associated Discourse discussion.\n\n**A No vote would result in rejection of these terms.**\n",

This proposal seeks the community's vote to either:\n\n - Distribute coin rewards to users as $RLY based on pro rata ownership of the Creator Coin eligible for rewards as opposed to simply increasing the backing liquidity pool, OR\n\n - Keep the current system of distributing coin rewards to creators and communities through liquidity backing the entire token bonding curve.\n \nFor the full discussion, please review the Discourse post to create a 2nd proposal on delivery mechanism - https://forum.rally.io/t/rewards-evolution/249/34\n \n**Background:** \n - As part of the comprehensive upgrade, distributing Community Activity Rewards as $RLY to all holders in a Creator Coin community was proposed.  The advantage of this system is to enable creators to earn income as $RLY and potentially realize that income without having to sell their Creator Coin. The drawback of this system is that it doesn’t encourage rewards to be immediately added to the liquidity pool. \n\n - The current flaws in the distribution system are fixed via the hourly mechanism.  As Masongos succinctly states in the Discourse discussion: “Hourly rewards distributions fixes the problem, we don’t need to take the additional measures.”  \n \n**Proposal**\n \n**“Distribute in $RLY” Vote** \n - This vote would result in approval of the above terms to enable the core development team to enable Community Activity Rewards distribution in $RLY tokens on or after March 27, 2021 .\n \n**“Keep Current Mechanism” Vote**\n - This vote would result in rejection of these terms.  The current distribution method would be maintained, and $RLY rewards would continue to be added directly to the liquidity backing Creator Coins (as they are today).**\n \n",

      "title": "Proposal to Enable Upgrade and Continued Evolution of Community Activity Rewards",
      "content": "**Summary/Abstract:**\nEnable a major upgrade and continued evolution of Community Activity Rewards (CAR) as follows:\n - Align calculation and distribution intervals to ensure anyone benefiting from a reward distribution is doing so in more direct proportion to their impact on reward allocation; target hourly and introduce some jitter/randomness.\n - Introduce a calculation based on sells and converts out of a coin to the benefit of holders that remain; allow developer discretion to define and iterate on this calculation.\n - Programmatically add and remove coins from CAR eligibility based on a calculation that encompasses usage and active participants. Coins below eligibility thresholds would not receive any rewards for a period. Allow developer discretion to experiment with eligibility thresholds.\n - Allow developer discretion of 1-4X the published rate of the current CAR schedule as network digests these new upgrades and the Creator Review Council accelerates creator approvals.\n - Allow developer discretion to deploy upgrades to this system as they are ready as opposed to consolidating into a single, one-time change\n \n*Note, separate Snapshot proposal will address whether to distribute coin rewards to users as $RLY based on pro rata ownership of the coin as opposed to simply increasing the backing liquidity pool.*\n \nFor reference:\n - Discourse discussion since January 25, 2021 - https://forum.rally.io/t/rewards-evolution/249/1\n\n - Discourse discussion to create a 2nd proposal on delivery mechanism such that the community can weigh this very important part of the network upgrade individually - https://forum.rally.io/t/rewards-evolution/249/34\n \n \n**Background:**\nThe 7.5B $RLY allocated to promote network usage represents 50% of the fully diluted supply.  This schedule enables a reward schedule of 2,568,493 $RLY per day over 8 years. CAR is the first program that draws from this bucket and currently distributes only ~80,000 $RLY per day.\n\nDetails on the design are available here:\n - Rewards FAQ - https://rally.io/rewardsfaq/\n - Original Rewards Blog Post - https://medium.com/rallynetwork/rally-launches-community-activity-rewards-99a04cb0c25\n - Current Community Rewards Table - https://rally.io/community-rewards/\n\nThe current reward design began with the thinking that consistently increasing total liquidity backing of a coin is one of the strongest indicators of the health of a creator coin community and should therefore be the basis of a reward system that benefits the entire community. \n\nThis network upgrade achieves this goal as well as enabling creators to earn income from Community Activity Rewards without having to sell their own coin. And finally, sells/converts out of a coin also benefits the community holders that remain.\n\n**Target outcomes:**\nA - Creators earn income in $RLY through CAR rewards for driving increased usage of their coin economies. Creators’ crypto income becomes higher than any fiat alternative and becomes headline worthy, driving media attention and word-of-mouth through various creator communities. This would create a direct and measurable uplift in high quality creator applications and creator coin launches after these changes become well understood in a ~3 month timeline.\n\nB - ROI of CAR as measured by total liquidity staked into the sidechain becomes at least 60% of Liquidity Mining program.  As of 3/5/21, Liquidity Mining’s emissions of 250K / day results in $24.4M of total value locked (TVL) across Uniswap and Balancer.  Currently, CAR’s emissions of 80K / day results in $2.1M of TVL on the sidechain. This imbalance represents a 3.3X difference in TVL per token emission. A successful CAR upgrade would bring this more inline to less than a 1.6X difference as a key performance indicator the community can monitor.\n\n**Proposal:**\nEnable the developer to enact the upgrades to Community Activity Rewards as defined in the Summary of this proposal.  Note, while this Snapshot includes the wording of the original proposal by DFS to distribute CAR as $RLY, there is a good debate that the $RLY CAR should continue to be inserted into the liquidity of the entire community.  Thus, a second simultaneous proposal will enable the community to weigh in on just the delivery method. \n\n**A Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:**\n - Approval of the above terms to enable the development team to enable these comprehensive network upgrades (with the exception of the $RLY Community Activity Rewards distribution mechanism to be voted on separately) on or after March 27, 2021 \n\n**A No vote would result in rejection of these terms.**\n",

      "content": "**Summary/Abstract:**\nProposal to enable up to 40M $RLY, previously allocated for distribution through the Community Treasury Fundraise, to be distributed through CoinList.\n - Proceeds from the distribution through CoinList will be directed to the Community Treasury, following payment of CoinList’s fees.\n - This distribution will be made to non-US crypto audiences to increase the reach of and participation in the Rally Network.\n - Discourse discussion available here: https://forum.rally.io/t/additional-distribution-opportunity/432/12\n\n**Background:**\nAs the Community Treasury Fundraise wraps up, the Community was able to raise a significant amount for the treasury without tapping into the full 500M $RLY originally approved for distribution through the fundraise.  CoinList (coinlist.co) provides a platform for digital asset companies to distribute their tokens to non-US parties who are interested in becoming a part of new token protocols and ecosystems.  CoinList prides themselves on compliant distributions, focusing on crypto-savvy audiences outside of the US, and carefully vetting all parties through Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance processes.\n\n**Proposal**\nThis proposal will authorize CoinList’s distribution of up to 40M $RLY previously approved for distribution through the Community Treasury Fundraise.\n\nThe terms are as follows:\n - Up to 40M $RLY will be distributed by CoinList to non-U.S. parties at a negotiated price based off the reference price, calculated as the 15-45 day trailing average price of $RLY.  CoinList will determine the appropriate trailing day range based on prevailing market conditions.\n - A 6-month lock up period will apply for each transaction, during which $RLY purchased may not be traded.  In addition, $RLY will be subject to a 12-month release schedule on a monthly basis in equal amounts, subject to the lock-up, such that the first 6 months of released $RLY will become available 6 months after the transaction date, and all $RLY sold in the transaction will be fully released 12 months following the transaction date.\n - A maximum purchase amount per purchaser of USD$1000 worth of $RLY will apply.\n\n**A Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:**\n\n - Appoint Rally Genesis Team to enable CoinList to receive up to 40M $RLY from the Community allocation on behalf of the Rally community for distribution. Any undistributed $RLY will be returned to the Community allocation.\n - Authorize CoinList to provide services to effectuate the CoinList distribution through the CoinList platform pursuant to the terms outlined above, including providing technology services to effectuate the process, and preparing and entering into any necessary documentation.  Following the completion of the distribution, and payment of standard fees to CoinList for its role effectuating the distribution, CoinList will transmit all proceeds from the distribution to the Community Treasury wallet address: 0x076C129ea5Ba0Beb79356f8C226c813Eceb69993\n\n**A No vote would result in rejection of this distribution.**\n",

      "title": "New Creator Approval Process Proposal - Creator Review Council",
      "content": "*Proposal*\nRally Staff, advisors, and members of the $RLY holders community to form a Creator Review Council to review and approve/deny creators on a regular basis.\n\nStarting Date: On or by April 15, 2021.\n\n*Background*\nAt the time of this writing, based on previous proposals, we use this Rally Snapshot to post all creators for approval on an individual basis with voting open to anyone holding $RLY ($RLY being the governance token for all Rally and Creator Coin proposals).\n\nAt scale, this solution may become untenable as the number of inbound creators may exceed the ability to post and vote on dozens of proposals per week.\n\n*Number of Council Members and Nominations*\nThe council would initially be comprised of 5-7 members, with room to add additional members in the future based on scale. Rally Staff shall comprise no more than 3 members of the council to promote community oriented governance. One or more seats may be allotted to official Advisors. The rest of the council would be at large members of the Rally community. At large self nominations would be reviewed for contributions to the Rally community and participation in $RLY governance and Creator Coin economies.\n\nRally Staff to create a simple form application for self nominations. Call for submissions to be made on social media (Rally.io Twitter), Discord, community calls, and blog. Call for submissions will take place over one week, then an up to two weeks to vet and select a roster to be put forward for a Snapshot proposal vote.\n\nSelected at large community members would be eligible for compensation for Council membership. Compensation to be $1,000 per month, payable in USDC. Staff, Advisors, and Ambassadors are not eligible for compensation for council membership. \n\n*Scope*\nCouncil will review Creator Coin candidates, and may request to review previously approved creators.\n\n*Format*\nThe council would be organized through a special role + private Discord channel(s). One channel for the list of creators, one channel for the discussion of creators.\n\nCreators up for approval would be captured in a privately shared document, such as a spreadsheet, with info such as Name, Bio, and at least one social link for review purposes.\n\n*Voting*\nAn explicit “Yes” vote would not be required on a per creator basis. Rather, any council member can request a focused discussion of a creator. A council member can then call for a vote on a single creator should that member procure 1 other member to support, or second, their request. A simple majority (51%) of Yes votes would then be required to approve the creator.\n\nIf a vote is required for a previously approved member, 67% majority is required for removal. Voting period 1 week (M-F).\n\n*Quorum*\nShould a vote be required, quorum for a new creator is 67% of members.\n\nQuorum to vote on a previously approved creator for removal is 90%.\n\n*Frequency*\nGiven current volumes of creators submitted for proposal, creator review can happen 2 days/week. This would also stress test the system as volume grows.\n\nAt future scale (dozens of creators per week), creator review should happen 1 day/week.\n\n*Oversight and Term Limits*\n$RLY is the governance token for voting on this future proposal, and the council members proposal. After approval, council members can be removed by $RLY token holders proposal. The council is not an extension of the company, but rather serves the community of $RLY holders.\n\n* Transparency: Rosters of recently reviewed creators will be posted to a new Discord channel. If a candidate or current creator is brought to a vote, those Yes and No votes will include the Ethereum addresses of the voters.\n* NDA: All council members will sign an NDA. This will be necessary should the launch of an approved creator require an embargo.\n* Term limits: While a sitting council member can resign or be removed through a $RLY Governance vote (via Snapshot proposal), we should consider term limits for sitting members. Initial thought is to review participation every 6 months, with a maximum term of 2 years. Council could ensure some level of ongoing attrition such that there is a mix of experience across council members.\n* Resignation or replacement: If a council member resigns or requires replacement, there will be a call for submissions for a new council member and a Snapshot proposal vote on a select set of candidates.\n* Documentation: Documentation of these rules to be posted to the Rally wiki.\n\nA 'Yes\" vote indicates you agree to the formation of the Creator Review Council to review creator eligibility for Creator Coins, replacing the current method for voting on new creator individually via Snapshot proposals.\n\nA \"no\" vote indicates you want to continue to use Snapshot proposals to vote on creator eligibility for Creator Coins.",

Following our humble beginnings as a Los Angeles-based local blog and club sub-promotion company, we have since seen our global outreach, industry experience, scope and knowledge expand exponentially with each passing year. \nAs of today, we have organized and promoted over 1,000 events, ranging from festivals and warehouse events, to mega-clubs, intimate lounges and unique outdoor venues. \nAside from producing events, we have helped dozens of music artists, festivals, music labels, pro-audio companies, and consumer-facing businesses reach our target demographic and ultimately “get their word out.” thanks to the digital marketing, social media, and native promotion skills we have honed in through our years of experience in the nightlife and entertainment industry. \nIn May of 2019 we went a step further, launching a fully-fledged techno + house apparel and merchandise Shop by 6AM. \n\nDistribution Plan: \nWe will be using our $RAVE coins as incentives for our most loyal supporters via our events and shop purchases. We plan on running contests to include the $RAVE coin as added incentive as well as include them as part of our special merchandise drops. When events return, we plan to reward attendees as well.\n\nHolding Mechanics: \n$RAVE coin holders will be put on a special list where they get offered exclusive discounts and access to our merch, first-notice of events before they are announced. \nHolding $RAVE coins and showing proof at our future events may grant them discounted entry and merch at the show. \n\nTransactions: \nWe will incentivize our fans to use these $RAVE coins for purchases of merch and event tickets, and are exploring exclusive streaming opportunities for $RAVE.\n\nCommunity Treasury Grant Tier: $1000\n\nA 'yes' will approve this proposal and provide a $1000 gift coin grant\n\nA 'no' will deny this prop\n",

      "title": "Proposal to retire Yield Delegating Vaults and reallocate Liquidity Mining rewards",
      "content": "**Summary/Abstract:**\n - Proposal to retire Yield Delegating Vaults (YDVs) by setting $RLY rewards to 0 and reallocate Liquidity Mining rewards to Uniswap LP Pool\n\n - Existing YDV capital participants can continue to leave funds in YDVs and earn the full compounding interest of the underlying Yearn vaults until it is convenient for the user to withdrawal funds  \n - The core team recommends users withdraw funds from YDVs as quickly as feasible, due to ongoing potential changes in the underlying Yearn Vault strategies that YDV smart contracts utilize \n - Rally core development team will no longer support YDV smart contracts once rewards are set to zero\n - For the deeper community discussion, please see the Discourse post: https://forum.rally.io/t/retiring-yield-delegating-vaults-and-next-steps/411\n\n**Background:**\nThe YDVs were the first feature Rally launched to Ethereum mainnet and have been an important part of early plans to distribute $RLY to supportive community members and start building a community treasury that could fund ongoing growth and development of the Rally Network. The core motivations for YDVs were:\n\n - Introduce the Rally project to the Ethereum DeFi community\n - Provide a fair distribution mechanism to start getting $RLY in the hands of contributing community members\n - Enable users to earn $RLY through active participation in the Rally Network\n - Create a sustainable way in which contributors could support building a community treasury without taking on significant capital risk\n\nYDVs have largely performed as expected to date but the risk profile seems to be changing. We chose Yearn vaults for the yield delegation and $RLY distribution strategy because of the quality of their engineering team, the stability of their protocol, and our understanding of the level of risk associated with their yield generating strategies. \n\nAs Yearn builds forward on their vaults and starts migrating to their v2 design, this risk profile starts to change substantially. The Yearn v2 design allows for more rapid iteration on strategies, dynamic rebalancing within a single vault in order to support multiple strategies simultaneously, and a general move towards capital efficiency and leverage possibilities. All of these are fantastic ideas and should continue to position Yearn as a leader in the DeFi space. However, they all also increase the risk profile of Yearn vaults in a way that makes them less compatible with the motivations behind the introduction of YDVs. And this is all exacerbated by the fact that one of the seemingly minor modifications supporting the v2 transition opened the door to an exploit of one of Yearn’s v1 vaults (https://www.coindesk.com/yearn-finance-dai-vault-exploit).\n\nPerhaps most importantly, we no longer need to continue funding the treasury through YDVs as we conclude the first part of the Rally community fundraise (https://forum.rally.io/t/community-treasury-fundraise-update-and-next-steps/378/).\n \n**Proposal**\n - Set all Yield Delegating Vault rewards to 0 $RLY (https://vaults.rally.io/vaults), and return the full underlying yearn vault interest to the capital contributor\n - Reallocate the current Pool 6 rewards for Curve 3pool LPs to the Pool 1 Uniswap Pool LP reward (https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x27fd0857f0ef224097001e87e61026e39e1b04d1/), increasing the Uniswap LP Rewards by roughly 15% \n \n**A Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:**\nApproval of the above terms to enable the core development team to set YDV rewards to 0 and reallocate Liquidity Mining Rewards to the Uniswap LP Pool \n \n**A No vote would result in rejection of these terms.**\n",

      "content": "Bremner Morris is a creator tech advisor and an expert at developing go-to-market strategies that help accelerate creator adoption of platforms and technologies. He recently served as the Head of Go-to-Market and Revenue for Patreon, where he built out an organization that drove the adoption of Patreon’s platform and the success of the creators on the platform. He currently advises creator projects Run The World, Playbook Technologies, STATIONHEAD, and Mine’d on their creator adoption, engagement and monetization strategies.\n\nBremner's collaboration with the Rally Network would enable him to use his expertise to build go-to-market initiatives to drive further creator adoption of the Rally Network. In his activities, Bremner would oversee sales and marketing campaigns that will introduce Creator Coin to new, diverse creators and networks, and operationalize creator onboarding, enabling creators to successfully onboard and drive adoption of their Creator Coin economies. Additionally, Bremner would help increase the awareness of Rally’s core value propositions through content marketing and brand marketing initiatives.\n\nCheck out his intro video and full the Discourse discussion here: https://forum.rally.io/t/engaging-bremner-morris-for-go-to-market-success/338\n\nThe collaboration terms will be as follows:\n\n - 166,666 $RLY per month for a period of 5 months from Advisors and Collaborators pool.\n - Roughly half-time focus on Rally, as Bremner has existing commitments to other creator projects.\n - During this period, KPIs will be established and achievements will be shared with the community for review.\n - At the end of the 5 month period, the community will have the opportunity to evaluate the engagement and, if the community decides to extend the engagement, it can do so through a new proposal.\n\n **A YES vote for this proposal would approve Bremner Morris's engagement for the Rally Network's go-to-market success and deploy 166,666 $RLY at the end of each month of completed service from the Advisors and Collaborators pool to his wallet address at 0x152A454aEeB33f3363BDfD49A4fFAD0AA585c12f.**\n\n**A NO vote will result in no engagement.**\n",

Matt (band lead) streams regularly to their devout following and runs a solid community through his discord server focused on fun and connection via music. For Rally, the most exciting part about this creator is their enthusiasm for the platform, and willingness to lean into driving transactional use cases with exclusive access for coinholders. \n\nUsecases: The Classic Crime will employ the following use cases\n\n1 - Distribution of Gift Coin: Rewards for existing monthly subscribers in their Discord server, and giveaways through group party games like Jack Box and other browser-based multiplayer titles.\n2 - Incentives for HODLers: An added \"Coinholder\" Role and badge with some extra privileges like access to the private holder channel. In that channel Matt will have two exclusive streams monthly with music/viewing and just straight up hangs/AMA.\n3 - Transaction Commitments: The Classic Crime will sell handwritten lyrics and mystery boxes with their coin (last year they sold 100 mystery boxes at $100 ea in 1 week). Matt also plans to sell acoustic recordings from streams and unreleased sessions as an album (potentially exclusively via their CC). Matt will also provide song reviews/feedback in exchange for coins on stream and within Discord.\n\nCommunity Treasury Grant: $300\n\nA 'yes' vote will approve The Classic Crimes for the platform with a $300 gift coin grant from the treasury.\n\nA 'no' vote will decline this creator coin.",

      "title": "Treasury Funding Proposal - Creator Coin Content Curation System",
      "content": "Rally has come across an exciting opportunity to pair development priorities with a mainstream music artist that puts Creator Coin at the center of their next major marketing push. To make full use of this rare chance, Business Development seeks approval from the Community Treasury to fund the development of a Creator Coin Content Curation system.\n\nFor the uninitiated, being a mainstream music artist means that you’re getting sent MANY demos (music tracks/projects) from unknown artists all the time. However, after taking a look at the market the Rally team has identified that there is no good/established system for the management and curation of these tracks. This is where our opportunity lies - to create a Content Curation system that will have applicable use not only for record labels and music artists, but also for streamers, and esports teams to organize songs and video clips for contests within their communities.\n\nWe believe that this project will put Rally at the forefront of new creators’ minds when considering new ways to grow their businesses - and strengthen our position in providing cool additional tools for our community to engage with using Creator Coins.\n\nDevelopment for this project consists of providing an initial build, after which the artist will be responsible for ongoing costs/hosting and maintenance:\n\nConcepting and UX of the system, including multi-page submission flow.\nCreation of a ‘media manager’ CMS for artists to receive and approve submissions for public display on a webpage of the artist’s choosing.\nCMS functionality to support the organization of submitted/approved tracks being assigned to various playlists designated by the artist.\nSubmission flow to allow user submissions to be tied to a Creator Coin donation, for favorable placing on the media playlists.\nFront-facing media manager/playlist functionality to allow for ANY Rally user to donate Creator Coins to improve the standings of approved tracks/media.\nTime required and budget to complete this project have been informed by both internal and external fullstack engineers, averaging approximately the following per chunk of the project:\n\nConcepting ~16 hrs\nDesign (+Revisions) & Figma Walkthrough ~20 hrs\nFrontend ~40 hrs\nBackend ~100 hrs\n\nTaking an average agency rate of $175/hr, total estimated budget is $30,800. Accounting for a ~15% contingency/scope brings us to a total of $35,000.\n\nTo justify this spend, we’re using Portugal. The Man’s performance on the Rally network as our primary reference point. Since officially launching on 1/14, $PTM has generated $20,000 in direct buys into their coin (no converts, treasury grants, or rewards counted) from approx. 200 unique users. These users were motivated by a sheer love of PTM, with the only immediately announced deliverable being exclusive Discord access to unlock their Fan-generated video archive.\n\nTaking these numbers into account, we need a way to estimate the relative impact of the artist in question. The most relevant comparisons are demographic, social reach, and monthly plays.\n\nBehold! Handwavey voodoo magic social reach comparisons (written as generalized multiples vs. PTM to maintain hidden artist identity):\n\nTwitter: ~2x Followers\nInstagram: ~3x Followers\nTwitch: N/A (PTM doesn’t stream - this artist does, and they game!)\n\nThe first use of this app will be used for a multi-month (min. 3 mo. commitment) program to find new tracks for up-and-coming artists to get signed to their record label. This artist, when previously running a similar promo, would receive ~150 submissions per week. This will be run 3 times per month for approx. 400 monthly submissions with a monthly ‘grand finale’ where the artist chooses tracks to sign and reveals winners.\n\nIn addition to the above, the artist plans to relaunch their Discord, livestream, and podcast all in support of their coin launch (with a ‘maybe’ of exclusive merch drops).\n\nTaking the above into account, we believe it is safe to assume the artist in question will perform at least as well as PTM over their first 30 days on name and social reach alone. Add in the monetization potential from up from artists and fans promoting tracks using the artist’s coins - plus other exclusive stream/access benefits (podcast q’s, private streams, dj sets, song requests) - and we have a killer opportunity to grow interest in Rally.\n\n[Quantitative Goals over 90 day period]\n400+ Unique Account Signups & Buys\n3 Add’l Creators to use product (12 in 180 days)\n$50,000+ monetization through buys & donates\n\n[Qualitative Goals over 90 day period]\nMainstream press recognition for pioneering unique music+crypto usecase\nData gathering of new demographic\n\nTo honor the relationship with the artist that inspired the concept, this system will have an exclusive usage window for 30 days before being opened to add’l Rally creators.\n\nA ‘Yes’ vote will approve $35,000 from the Community Treasury to be used for development of this Creator Coin Content Curation system, and to lock in 1 top-tier artist.\n\nA ‘No’ vote will decline this initiative.",

The Man and helped guide them towards a successful launch. He is all-in on social tokens and wants to start an agency specifically geared towards bringing big name musicians onto Rally.  More on Josh, including a video explanation from him, in this Discourse thread: https://forum.rally.io/t/rly-grant-structure-for-businesses-building-atop-rally/188\n\nIn this grant structure, the Initial Grant is meant to provide a relatively small amount of “seed funding” to help Josh get his agency off the ground and kick off a fundraise.  The larger Scaling Grant is contingent upon a successful fundraise for his agency and has a max cap. \n\nThis is a simple structure that also aligns incentives in a way that puts skin in the game for both the Rally community and Josh. \n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would approve a 250k $RLY grant to Josh Katz’s agency from the Creator, Brand and Community Partnerships pool with no vesting terms, and also authorize a future grant should conditions be met.  \n\nA No vote for this proposal would result in no change.\n\n",

      "title": "Proposal to Change Creator Coin Restrictions",
      "content": "**Summary/Abstract**\nThis proposal seeks to make changes to certain restrictions imposed on Creator Coin to increase flexibility and benefits, but maintain protections, for Creators and their communities.\n\n**Details**\nCreator Coin restrictions are currently spread across multiple parts of Rally’s tech stack with some inconsistencies between what is represented in the display and what is allowed by the system.  To review the full write up on the current state of Creator Coin restrictions, redesign objectives, and the thinking behind the proposed changes, please review the full discussion on Discourse: https://forum.rally.io/t/creator-coin-restrictions/136\n\n**Proposed Changes**\nThis proposal, if passed, will make the following changes to Creator Coin restrictions:\n1.  Modify Creator flow control\n    -  Increase max allowance to 5% of circulating supply\n    -  Build to allowance based on time instead of community activity\n    -  Allowance still subject to vesting restriction below\n2.  Introduce Creator vesting of genesis supply\n    -  Initial supply of Creator Coins unlocks for Creator use over 12 months\n    -  Unlocked supply still subject to flow restriction above\n3.  Add flow control to all users\n    -  No vesting based restriction for general usage but introduce flow based transfer and sell restrictions that mirror Creators\n4.  Add slip based fee for Creator Coin buy/sell conversions\n    -  Tax sells of Creator Coin based on how far we move along the bonding curve with the transaction\n    -  Fee is calculated in Creator Coin and transferred in full to Creator\n    -  Fee is a configurable proportion of the $RLY liquidity that will be removed from the pool based on this trade\n5.  Empower development team to iterate on specific parameters used for flow controls, vesting schedule, and slip based fees\n    -  Flow controls to begin with max allowance of 5% of circulating supply with a build to max allowance occurring over 30 days; development empowered to modify max allowance between 1 and 10% and build time to max allowance between 7 and 60 days\n    -  Vesting schedule to begin by vesting Creator genesis supply monthly over 12 months; any modifications to be resubmitted for a governance vote\n    -  Slip based fee to begin by taxing sales of a Creator Coin the percentage of the total liquidity pool available for the Creator Coin removed by the transaction. This is adjusted by a scalar factor that will begin at 1 (i.e. if your trade will remove 10% of the liquidity pool, the trade will incur a 10% slip fee transferred to the Creator); development empowered to modify scalar between 0 and 1 for experimentation\n6.  Allow configurable exclusions to support known transactional use cases\n“transfer to” exclusion ensuring commerce and donations are not unnecessarily restricted\n    -  “transfer from” exclusion ensuring air drops or other activities generally related to token distribution are not unnecessarily restricted\n7.  No change to:\n    -  Compliance and risk based limits for USDC redemptions\n    -  Credit card purchase limits\n    -  Risk based bridge limits\n\n**A YES Vote will implement the above Proposed Changes to Creator Coin restrictions as they currently exist**\n\n**A NO Vote will result in no change to current Creator Coin restrictions**\n",

(Note: The Rally community would own the code, and the app can be retrofitted for other creators.)\n\nA No vote for this proposal would decline the funding request.",

      "title": "Proposal to Approve Monthly Resets to Rewards Multipliers for YDVs",
      "content": "**Abstract**\nThis proposal recommends ongoing, monthly resets to the multipliers on each Yield Delegating Vault (YDV) to take into account $RLY price changes and support the continued long-term growth of the community treasury.\n\n**Details**\nYDVs wrap deposits into underlying Yearn vaults. As these deposits earn via Yearn strategies, accumulated earnings are transferred to the community treasury and an amount of $RLY proportional to this transfer is made available as a reward for depositors. The amount of $RLY made available is a multiple of the tokens transferred to the treasury configurable on each YDV. The multiple is expressed relative to the tokens transferred to the treasury (i.e. the $USDC vault transfers $yUSDC to the treasury and the multiple expresses how many $RLY should be emitted for each $yUSDC transferred). Since each token type transferred by each YDV to the treasury has a different value, this multiple is different for each YDV and is intended to be relative to the value of the token that YDV supports.\n\nThe multiples described above were initially set with the intention of doubling the APY of underlying Yearn vaults. Multiples have not been changed since initial launch configuration, and price changes to $RLY mean these vaults are currently offering ~200% APY.\n\nIn the best interests of the long term sustainability of the total 500MM $RLY allocated for distribution via YDVs, monthly adjustments to the multiples, to be set within the range of 1.5X to 3X, will both continue to motivate deposits as well as enable community treasury building at a rate appropriately relative to $RLY emitted through YDVs. \n\n**Link**\nFor further information and to review a deeper discussion on this topic, please see the discussion on Discourse: https://forum.rally.io/t/rewards-evolution/249.\n\n**Proposal**\nImplement an ongoing, monthly reset of the multiplier on each YDV to take into account $RLY price change with a target of 1.5X to 3X return on underlying Yearn vaults.  The 30 day trailing average price of $RLY will be used as the basis for resetting the multiplier.\n \n\n**A YES Vote means that the multiplier on each YDV will be updated monthly  to range between 1.5X to 3X returns of underlying Yearn vaults.**\n\n**A NO Vote will result in no change to the current YDV multipliers.**\n\n",

Thus a link has been provided to reference the original proposal._\n\nIn the original proposal, we proposed a part time role for moderating Rally community discussion. In light of a recent notable increase in activity in the Creator Coin & $RLY Discord, especially during the hours from 5pm - 8am PT, we seek to increase Soul's hours to keep up with this demand. and to be a voice for the community to respond to and educate the community at large.\n\nCompensation for being a full time Community Ambassador is $4500 USDC and 50,000 RLY on the 1st of each month. After the 6-month term, scope of role and performance to be reviewed for continuation/renewal.\n\n* A \"Yes\" vote will approve Soul of Jacobeh as a Full Time Community Ambassador.\n* A \"No\" vote will deny Soul of Jacobeh as a Full Time Community Ambassador.",

To date, we've made sure to keep most of the original Rally team off of the Rally Registry so that it's primarily creators that drive new proposals.  However, Ira is becoming much more active in governance which is fantastic for the Rally community given her legal background, and so want to empower her to create proposals.\n\nWith regards to Rob, we've previously let in key creator acquisition folks into the Registry such as me and Grant.  Rob is an extension of that and is already teeing up a bunch of high quality creators/brands.   Allowing him make proposals instead of asking someone else to do it will streamline things.\n\n\n- A \"Yes\" vote will approve Ira and Rob into the Registry/Snapshot, and enable them to submit proposals. \n\n- A \"No\" vote will deny Ira and Rob access to the Registry/Snapshot\n",

      "content": "\nSummary/Abstract:\n\nProposal to approve the final terms of the sale of $RLY by the Rally community to increase the Community Treasury\n\nBackground:\nPreviously, the Rally community passed a proposal to approve the sale of up to 500M $RLY by the Rally community to increase the Community Treasury, and authorized the Rally Genesis Team to engage a third party agent to effectuate the fundraise.  \n\nThe Rally Genesis Team has appointed a third party agent to act as the Rally community’s agent to sell the approved $RLY through its trading counterparties (“Community Agent”).  The Community Agent has committed to engaging participants in this fundraise who are interested in a long term stake in the Rally Network and its vision to operationalize social tokens and enable creators to build digital businesses.\n\nIn addition, to facilitate the work of the Community Agent on the community’s behalf, the Rally Genesis Team has authorized Rally SEZC, Ltd., the parent organization of the company behind the launch of the Rally Network, to take operational actions required to effectuate the community fundraise, including but not limited to (i) release of up to 500M $RLY to the Community Agent from the Rally community allocation for sale to participants in the fundraise, and (ii) arrangement of payment of a fee to the Community Agent for services rendered.\n\nThe initial proposal specified that no sale will be made until final terms are approved by the community.  This proposal details those final terms for approval.\n\n\nTerms:\nPrice: The price for all $RLY sold will be a negotiated price based off the reference price, calculated as either (i) the spot price of $RLY on the day of the transaction, or (ii) the thirty day average price of $RLY trailing from the day of the transaction, in both cases based on the price(s) of $RLY as publicly accessible on CoinGecko.  \n\n\nLock up Period: The lock up period for each transaction, during which any $RLY purchased may not be traded, will range from 6 to 24 months.  In addition, vesting restrictions will apply.\n\n\nCommunity Agent Discretion: The specific terms for any sale will be decided in negotiation between the Community Agent and its purchaser counterparty, based on its counterparty’s interest, its status and prevailing market conditions. In all cases, the Community Agent will act in the best interest of the Rally community.\n\n\nCommunity Agent Fee:  A fee of 3.5% of the total amount raised from this community fundraise will be paid to the Community Agent for services rendered, payable in $RLY and subject to a 90 day lock up, and paid through the proceeds earned through the community fundraise. \n\n\nNote that a few terms differ from the placeholder terms outlined in the initial Snapshot proposal, which contemplated (i) a reference price based off the average price in the last 7 to 30 day trading period, and (ii) lock-up periods between 12 to 24 months.  These revisions to the terms have been made in consideration of current market conditions.  \n\n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\nApproval of the above terms to enable the Community Agent to proceed with effectuating sales of up to 500,000,000 $RLY from the community token allocation, where the proceeds of any sale will be directed to the community treasury.\n\n\nA No vote would result in rejection of these terms.\n",

      "title": "[PROPOSAL] Should the Rally community approve the sale of $RLY from the treasury?",
      "content": "Summary/Abstract:\n\nProposal to approve the sale of $RLY by the Rally community to increase the Community Treasury\n\nMotivation:\n\nCurrently, the Community Treasury is funded by the yield delegated from the Rally Yield Delegating Vaults (YDVs).  By having a larger community treasury pool with diversified assets, the community can scale the Rally Network and empower the community to effectuate more development and engagement.  \nA community-approved sale of $RLY tokens, where the proceeds of such sale would be directed to the Community Treasury, would enable the Rally community to raise funds for the Community Treasury in ETH and expand the distribution of the $RLY governance token in the process. \n\nThe structure of this token sale is designed to maximize control to the Rally community. Only the community can choose to pass it, and the community will have full control over the proceeds generated by it.  Unlike a traditional financing that benefits a single party or entity, this $RLY fundraise will benefit the decentralized Rally community.  \n\nThe engagement of a third party to effectuate this token sale will benefit the Rally community in a number of ways:\n\n1. The third party will manage the transaction to ensure that participants in the sale are those interested in a long term stake in the Rally Network and its vision to operationalize social tokens and enable creators to build digital businesses.\n2. Lock-ups on $RLY sold through this fundraise require third party oversight to ensure that the $RLY is properly custodied or locked into a smart contract to comply with such time-based restrictions.\n\nAdditional Community Approval of Final Terms:\n\nA target of up to 500 million $RLY (8x circulating supply & 4.80% of the total Community token allocation) will be the maximum allocation to be sold, with the intent to to give a discount to purchasers on the average price in the last 7-30 day trading period in return for 12 month to 24 month lockups.  Note this is the maximum number of tokens to be sold, while the actual amount will depend on the market demand. \n\nThis Snapshot proposal will occur in two parts, this proposal being the first part. The second part will include a final approval for the total amount actually sold, and will be presented to the community for final approval.  Following finalization of terms and purchaser commitments, a new Snapshot proposal will detail all material terms and will be posted to request community approval to complete the sales.\n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\n\n1. Approve the release of up to 500,000,000 $RLY from the community token allocation to be sold in a community token sale, where the proceeds of any sale will be directed to the community treasury.\n\n2. Appoint Rally Genesis Team to engage a third party agent on behalf of the community to effectuate the fundraise, including preparing terms and term sheets, discussing and negotiating with potential purchasers, and preparing any necessary documentation.  Note: no sale will be made until final approval of terms by the community, as noted above.\n\nA No vote would make no change.\n",

Beyond just referring them to the platform, I will break down creator token to each creator, guide and propose use cases around their token, help communicate those on social media and will amplify on my channels. For 5 tokens referred, that means $1.25k worth of $RLY to alexmasmej.eth.\n\nMotivation:\n\n$ALEX is arguably the first creator token. I could onboard 5 people a month on average that are either in crypto or adjacent, like in tech or entertainment.\n\nI have a unique edge because my audience and reputation mean that I get inbounds of people wanting help for their social tokens, so I have the leverage to be a Rally ambassador; plus, my growing Twitter audience is very receptive to social tokens announcements.\n\nTarget launch: ASAP if passed\n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\n\nAllocate $250 worth of $RLY to alexmasmej.eth disbursed monthly.\n",

As part of the proposal, the Rally team will pre-fund the Community Treasury with $60k, during which time the community will have ample time to start measuring and evaluating these PR activities.\n\nWe strongly believe that strategic communications will drive the success of the overall Rally project, including additional influential creator sign-ups and consumer participation, as well as establishing trust, transparency and affinity with crypto press and thought-leaders. We’d like to propose a recurring grant from the Community Treasury - up to a max of $20k/mo - to retain a PR firm to elevate the Rally Network’s external presence in a few key areas: 1) global content marketing, 2) global media relations, and 3) global events management.\n\nPR firm would be vetted and directly managed by Kurt Patat, former Head of Consumer Communications at YouTube.  Continued services with PR firm subject to evaluation by Rally community per the outlined KPIs in Discourse.\n\nSummary:  \nA Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\n\n- Authorize max monthly payment of $20,000 for an indefinite period subject to continued community approval.\n- Authorize selection of firm and day-to-day management of engagement by Kurt Patat.",

Sum all communities with a positive delta, and allocate the proportional contribution amount to each corresponding Creator Coin. \n\nReward Distribution:\n- Distribute the total amount allocated each hour, at the end of each week. Weekly rewards will end Sunday at 00:00 UTC. \n- Actual Distribution time will vary pending total number of participants.\n- Rewards are distributed in the form of $RLY backing to that community's Creator Coin. \n\nUser Interface:\n- Each Creator Coin’s detail page will display current allocated rewards in $RLY. \n- Countdowns to the next reward allocation, and reward distribution will be displayed.\n- APYs will be displayed and calculated each hour for previously allocated rewards during the current week reward cycle.\n\nA **Yes** vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\n- Approve the Community Activity Rewards design\n- Allocate 1,000 $RLY per live creator per day to Community Activity Rewards\n- Approve the launch of the rewards live to the community on or after 11/12/2020\n",

      "content": "Proposal Type [4-1] \nFormally bring in a new advisor, Danilo S. Carlucci, to the Rally community to grow our creator ecosystem and optimize our engagement strategies. \n\nThis advisory arrangement is to be funded by 1) a $RLY grant from the Advisors and Collaborators pool, and 2) a monthly fee from the Community Treasury.\n\nPurpose\nDanilo has an impressive background having been in a senior community role at YouTube and has an extensive network of partners, creators and influencers that could be interested in joining Rally. As such, I’d like to propose him for a $RLY Grant from the Advisors and Collaborators pool, and engage him from the Community Treasury for strategic marketing consultancy and guidance on all things creator growth.\n\nRally team members will work closely with Danilo to develop KPIs for measuring success of this program over time.  Initial metrics will be focused on # of creators brought on per month (small, medium, large), as well as transaction support volume for onboarded creators.     \n\nWe’re setting a new precedent with this proposal. As Rally grows, it’s in the best interest of the community to identify advisors like Danilo that can bring outsized value to the network in the form of creators that can drive transaction volume. We have received many recommendations to work with Danilo, and believe he would be an extremely valuable resource and a great initial experiment to help scale the network.\n\nSummary\nAdvisory arrangement is as follows:\n \n-41,667 $RLY per month for a period of 12 months from Advisors and Collaborators pool (with ability to terminate)\n-$4.5k/mo strategic consulting services for an initial period of 6 months (paid by Community Treasury) \n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\n\n-Deploy 41,667 $RLY per month of completed service from the Advisors and Collaborators pool to: 0x11346EB995FbF9e0ca61436488B86682818aA893\n-Deploy $4.5k/mo from the Community Treasury for a period of 6 months, starting Monday 11/2 \n\nNOTE: As part of this proposal, Rally will be moving $50k worth of USDC into the treasury to augment the treasury and streamline engaging advisors such as these in the future. \n",

There is no specific time duration for these rewards programs but we initially estimate that they will run for at least 8 weeks.\n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\n\nDeploy $RLY from the Creator, Brand and Community Partnerships pool to two separate wallets: \n-Voting Rewards (200,000 $RLY) - [address]\n-General Community Rewards (50,000 $RLY) - [address]\n\nEstablish the following authority for these administrators:\n-Access and control $RLY allocated to the program, with the authorization to grant these funds for appropriate rewards \n-Design any sub-programs or initiatives relevant to support the proposed rewards programs based on community feedback \n",

      "content": "In the beginning, we need to make a decision on whether to accept everyone to the Rally Registry or keep the bar high. The benefit of keeping the bar high is that it keeps out bad actors from the network. The downside is that it limits the reach and awareness levels of Rally.\n\nIt might seem favorable to the community to let everyone in, but this will make it more difficult to amend the Registry later on. I recommend keeping the bar high to draw in the highest quality of creators to Rally. This will also let us focus on the growth of individual creators on the network and study how they’re using their Creator Coin.\n\nProposal: We should increase the quorum of $RLY to get accepted into the Rally Registry to minimum 50,000 $RLY. This will encourage more creators to be aware of the votes and also have them campaign for votes with $RLY holders.\n\nYes = Creator must have at least 50K yes votes AND be majority to be accepted\n\nNo = No change to the Rally Registry\n\nDiscourse discussion: https://forum.rally.io/t/increasing-quorum-for-rally-registry/68",

This program would also manage a pool of $RLY to be used for rewarding those contributions.\n\nThis program would be called the Developer Bounty Program, and its purpose will be to reward developers for their work in supporting the Rally Network and its users.\n\nA **Yes** vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\n\n1. Deploy $RLY from the Developer and Strategic Partnerships pool, to fund the Developer Bounty Program with an initial supply of 1,000,000 $RLY in a secure multi-sig safe, address here: 0xaE17A6D1592b73b913f94032dD273C4796A8d3aD\n\n2. Establish the Bounty Administration with the following authority:\n- Access and control $RLY allocated to the program, with the authorization to grant these funds to reward engineering efforts of community members in the Rally Network developer ecosystem.\n- Design any sub-programs or initiatives relevant to support the above engineering efforts [2.a].\n- Manage/Administer communications roles within Rally community tools (such as: Discord, Discourse, etc.)\n\n3. Approve the first Bounty Administrators.  Initially, the Bounty Administrators will be members of the Rally Network team in order to safely launch the program. At a later date, additional Bounty Administrators will be selected, approved and removed by the community.",

      "content": "**Proposal Type [4-2]**\nCreate a Developer Bounty Program funded by a $RLY grant from the Developer and Strategic Partnerships pool: 0x6057eacD61cD6cf40da3297f08e06e535aC2Af2a.\n\n**Purpose**\nRequest an allotment of $RLY from the Developer and Strategic Partnerships pool, to be sent to a developer community wallet administered on behalf of the Rally developer ecosystem.\n\n**Summary**\nIn order to support the community and encourage developer contributions to the Rally Network, a program should be established to fund developer contributions towards tools and technology on or around the Rally Network. This program would also manage a pool of $RLY to be used for rewarding those contributions.\n\nThis program would be called the Developer Bounty Program, and its purpose will be to reward developers for their work in supporting the Rally Network and its users.\n\nA **Yes** vote for this proposal would accomplish the following:\n\n1. Deploy $RLY from the Developer and Strategic Partnerships pool, to fund the Developer Bounty Program with an initial supply of 1,000,000 $RLY in a secure multi-sig safe, address here: 0xaE17A6D1592b73b913f94032dD273C4796A8d3aD\n\n2. Establish the Bounty Administration with the following authority:\n- Access and control $RLY allocated to the program, with the authorization to grant these funds to reward engineering efforts of community members in the Rally Network developer ecosystem.\n- Design any sub-programs or initiatives relevant to support the above engineering efforts [2.a].\n- Manage/Administer communications roles within Rally community tools (such as: Discord, Discourse, etc.)\n\n3. Approve the first Bounty Administrators.  Initially, the Bounty Administrators will be members of the Rally Network team in order to safely launch the program. At a later date, additional Bounty Administrators will be selected, approved and removed by the community.",
