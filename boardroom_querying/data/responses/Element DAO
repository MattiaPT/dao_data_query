      "content": "```\n\nEGP#: 36\n\nTitle: Payment for Milestone 2 of EGP-30 (Security & Incident Monitoring Services)\n\nAuthor(s): @DELV\n\nType: Protocol Proposal\n\nStatus: Proposed\n\nDate Proposed: 2024-09-27\n\nDate Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>\n\n```\n\n\n\n## **References**\n\n\n\n- [EGP-30: Hyperdrive Ethereum Mainnet Launch & Security Monitoring and Incident Management Services](https://forum.element.fi/discussion/23526-egp30-hyperdrive-ethereum-mainnet-launch-security-monitoring-and-incident-management-services)\n\n\n\n## **Sentence Summary**\n\n\n\nEGP-36 proposes the details for the Element DAO paying DELV as a service provider for Milestone 2 of EPG-30. \n\n\n\n## **Paragraph Summary**\n\n\n\nThis proposal includes the payment details for the following service provisions as described in Milestone 2, as referenced in EGP-30 (and seen below): \n\n\n\n- 90 Days Completed of Security Monitoring and Incident Management Following Proposal Effective Date\n\n    1. On behalf of the Element DAO, DELV will monitor, for a 90-day period, the health and safety of the Hyperdrive deployments. This includes, but is not limited to the following areas:\n\n        1. Yield Source Hacks\n\n        2. Hyperdrive Trading Vulnerabilities\n\n        3. Hyperdrive Non-Trading Vulnerabilities\n\n        4. Negative Interest Events (e.g., slashing events)\n\n        5. Checkpoint minting failures\n\n        6. Sunsetting Pools / Pausing Pools\n\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\n\n\nNow we’re approaching the 90-day mark (Oct 1st, 2024) of these services for Element DAO, this proposal is being put forward to receive the Milestone 2 payment from EGP-30. \n\n\n\n## **Specification**\n\n\n\n**Completion of Milestone 2: Security Monitoring and Incident Management (90 days)**\n\n\n\n- Service began on July 3rd, 2024 and ends on Oct 1st, 2024.\n\n- DELV has monitored all the deployed Hyperdrive Element DAO pools to ensure that certain invariants implying solvency are always true. These invariants are checked every transaction, or if no transactions occurred then once a day.\n\n- We continuously ran a series of fuzz tests on a fork of mainnet & L2 chains whenever a transaction occurred to help minimize risks of the pool entering a dangerous state. These tests explored the state resulting from a sequence of random trades made by trading bots starting from the current forked state. After each random trade the invariants are checked to ensure pool health.\n\n- We monitored all pools to ensure checkpoints were minted when necessary.\n\n- We automated delivering incident reports to a dedicated security team that addressed any potential concerns promptly, where the severity dictated the incidence response time. All critical issues were identified and investigated within hours of notification.\n\n\n\n**Milestone 2 Payment Details:**\n\n\n\n- 90 Days Completed of Security Monitoring and Incident Management: 2,000,000 ELFI\n\n- All payments payable in ELFI to DELV’s Ethereum Wallet: 0xF6094C3A380AD6161Fb8240F3043392A0E427CAC\n\n- **ACTION NEEDED FROM Element DAO:** As a part of the security monitoring and incident management services, DELV is an admin for pausing pools in case there is a threat to the underlying yield source or an interest issue. With the conclusion of this service provision term, the Element DAO (the GSC or an Element DAO member) will need to propose removing DELV as one of the `defaultPausers`.\n\n\n\n## **Proposed Code**\n\n\n\n```markdown\n\n{\n\n  \"proposalId\": 20,\n\n  \"votingVaults\": [\n\n    \"0x02Bd4A3b1b95b01F2Aa61655415A5d3EAAcaafdD\"\n\n  ],\n\n  \"extraVaultData\": [\n\n    \"0x00\"\n\n  ],\n\n  \"targets\": [\n\n    \"0x81758f3361A769016eae4844072FA6d7f828a651\"\n\n  ],\n\n  \"callDatas\": [\n\n    \"0x88b49b8335f0e25927b56f157efdb21d02bf672a49f4d9791d38efc15f1dafe958cd87a4\"\n\n  ],\n\n  \"proposalHash\": \"0xaeb689837d2c78dc746d9dc9be401beab8836e8a9948b0a435e775e90005a149\",\n\n  \"targetsTimeLock\": [\n\n    \"0x82eF450FB7f06E3294F2f19ed1713b255Af0f541\"\n\n  ],\n\n  \"calldatasTimeLock\": [\n\n    \"0x8522d1b20000000000000000000000005c6d51ecba4d8e4f20373e3ce96a62342b125d6d00000000000000000000000000000000000000000001a784379d99db42000000000000000000000000000000f6094c3a380ad6161fb8240f3043392a0e427cac\"\n\n  ],\n\n  \"callHashTimelock\": \"0x35f0e25927b56f157efdb21d02bf672a49f4d9791d38efc15f1dafe958cd87a4\",\n\n  \"lastCall\": 20943656,\n\n  \"ballot\": \"0\"\n\n}\n\n```\n\n\n\n**Notes:**\n\n\n\n- The `lastCall` will be created when the proposal is officially put onchain and will be set for 14 days from creation date.\n\n- The `proposalId` is currently set to 20 but this may need to be updated to 21 or 22 prior to being put onchain due to other proposals going through governance at the moment.\n\n\n\n## **Next Steps (Voting Outcome Summary)**\n\n\n\n1. This proposal is currently a `Draft`.\n\n    - We welcome all questions and comments over the next week, but please be advised that DELV Team Members will not be able to provide comments beyond formatting and technical commentary.\n\n2. After one week and once the feedback has been addressed, this will move to be officially `Proposed`.\n\n3. Once Proposed, there will be a 1 week review period before it moves to the next stage, Off-Chain Poll (Snapshot). [Note that DELV will put this proposal Onchain only if the quorum necessary to move this proposal forward passes by more than the number of votes used by DELV to initiate the proposal. In other words, DELV voting authority will not be used to ratify this proposal, either to meet quorum requirements or in determination of a majority.]\n\n4. On Snapshot, the governance community will vote for:\n\n    - **Yes:** You agree that EGP-36 should be accepted.\n\n    - **No:** You disagree that EGP-36 should be accepted.\n\n    - **Abstain:** You formally decline to vote either YES or NO.\n\n5. If this proposal passes the Off-Chain Poll, it will proceed to the On-Chain Vote, where the vote options will remain the same as on Snapshot.\n\n6. If this proposal passes, the proposal will officially be Accepted and the code will proceed to the Execution stage where DELV will receive their payment for Milestone 2 of EGP-30.\n\n7. **IMPORTANT NOTE/ACTION NEEDED:** The GSC or a member of the Element DAO will need to propose removing DELV as one of the `defaultPausers`.\n\n\n\n**Important note:** DELV will provide logistical and technical support for putting the proposals Off-chain (poll) and On-chain (vote), but neither DELV nor DELV Team Members will participate in the poll or vote.  Furthermore, DELV engineers will provide technical comments only, when clarity is needed; they will not provide any statements on the wisdom or appropriateness of the proposal. As noted above, DELV’s placement of this proposal to an onchain vote will only occur if the proposal is passed by more than the number of votes used by DELV to initiate the proposal. In other words, DELV’s voting authority will not be used to ratify this proposal, including for quorum purposes or for the determination of a majority.\n\n\n\n---",

      "title": "EGP-33: On-Chain and Snapshot Quorum Raise Proposal",
      "content": "```\n\nEGP#: 33\n\nTitle: On-Chain and Snapshot Quorum Raise Proposal\n\nAuthor(s): Mr. Sal\n\nType: Protocol Proposal\n\nStatus: Proposed\n\nDate Proposed: <2024-10-14>\n\nDate Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>\n\n```\n\n\n\n## **References**\n\n\n\n- https://docs-delv.gitbook.io/element-developer-docs/governance-council/element-governance-proposal-framework/the-governance-process/on-chain-voting-information\n\n- https://snapshot.org/#/elfi.eth/proposal/0xced7b92df0c707c3524a575e66a17f91587b5a8d892868ea53879548e792b6f0\n\n- https://mirror.xyz/0x3fcAf7DDf64E6e109B1e2A5CC17875D4a5993F39/bctuLRkf7oBL4mMJ9lPf0y0blFjBDslTUfUL0CEk1gc\n\n\n\n\n\n## **Sentence Summary**\n\n\n\nThis proposal is to raise the On-Chain and Snapshot quorum from 1.1m voting power to 2.77m voting power. \n\n\n\n## **Paragraph Summary**\n\n\n\nFor any proposal to have validated results through the governance process, whether it is a Social or Protocol proposal, it needs to meet quorum. When Element DAO launched two years ago the default quorum was set at 1.1m voting power with an initial ratio between quorum and float (circulating supply) of 9%.\n\n\n\nThis proposal addresses the change in voting power delegation since the launch of the DAO. Since there is more circulating and delegated ELFI due to vested and vesting DELV team members and investors there is a need to raise quorum.\n\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\n\n\nThe reason to raise the quorum isn’t only due to more circulating ELFI, but also to avoid the risk of self-passing proposals. Since the current quorum is low, a delegate with over 1.1m voting power can pass any proposal themselves. The 2.77m figure is also a temporary solution, in the future there could be a dynamically moving proposal quorum based on circulating supply and delegated voting power. \n\n\n\n## **Specification**\n\n\n\nTo find the new proposed quorum the total available voting power is calculated and then multiplied by 9%. This new quorum doesn’t account for voter apathy or vested ELFI remaining in the vesting vault that has not yet been withdrawn. As a result of the previously addressed uncertain variables, a 25% discount has been applied to the calculation.\n\n\n\nThere is 40,980,698.22 available voting power considering the voting power that's in the locking vault and tokens that are unencumbered. This also includes the vesting vault (which has a reduced voting weight being 5% of the total grant size) and excludes the foundation's ELFI outside of the 2m approved for the foundation to vote with.\n\n\n\nQuorum Calculation (as of 08/08/24):\n\n\n\nNew Quorum = Total Voting Power x 0.09 x 0.75\n\n\n\nNew Quorum = 40,980,698.22 x 0.09 x 0.75\n\n\n\nNew Quorum = 2766197.12985\n\n\n\nRounded New Quorum = 2.77m\n\n\n\n## **Proposed Code**\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/GregTheGreek/Element-Finance-Scripts/pull/21\n\n\n\n## **Next Steps (Voting Outcome Summary)**\n\n\n\n1. This proposal is currently a `Draft`.\n\n2. Once the feedback has been addressed, this will move to be officially `Proposed`.\n\n3. Once Proposed, there will be a 1 week review period before it moves to the next stage, Off-Chain Poll (Snapshot).\n\n4. On Snapshot, the governance community will vote for:\n\n    - **Yes:** You agree that EGP-33 should be accepted.\n\n    - **No:** You disagree that EGP-33 should be accepted.\n\n    - **Abstain:** You formally decline to vote either YES or NO.\n\n5. If this proposal passes the Off-Chain Poll, it will proceed to the On-Chain Vote, where the vote options will remain the same as on Snapshot.\n\n6. If this proposal passes, the proposal will officially be Accepted and the code will proceed to the Execution \n\n\n\n**Note:** In relation to this proposal to raise quorum, there should be a consideration to raise the proposal threshold from 55k voting power to the GSC threshold dynamically in addition to raising the GSC threshold to a higher amount of delegation such as 300k+. This can help address the current rise of ELFI in circulation.\n\n\n\n---",

      "title": "EGP-35: Delegation of HyperVue to Construct and Deploy an Incentive and Points Program for the Hyperdrive Protocol",
      "content": "```\n\nEGP#: 35\n\nTitle: Delegation of HyperVue to Construct and Deploy an Incentive and Points Program for the Hyperdrive Protocol\n\nAuthor: Windra Thio, Mr. Sal, Simona Pop\n\nType: DAO Proposal\n\nStatus: Proposed\n\nDate Proposed: 2024-09-27\n\n```\n\n\n\n### Sentence Summary\n\n\n\nThe HyperVue Foundation is requesting to be tasked with the responsibility of deploying and maintaining an incentive points program for the Hyperdrive Protocol.\n\n\n\n### Paragraph Summary\n\n\n\nAs the Hyperdrive Protocol continues to deploy various yield sources and has future plans for automated strategies and fixed rate borrows, the importance of certain actions such as LP’ing to ensure deep liquidity markets exist for potential fixed borrow assets are important to test out if the product is appealing and can generate usage from DeFi users. HyperVue believes that incentivizing those key aspects of the protocol is necessary to unlock the potential of the product. \n\n\n\n### Motivation\n\n\n\n- The HyperVue Foundation is committed to ensuring the success of the Hyperdrive Protocol. This is one of the key things we believe is necessary in doing so, and for that reason we are requesting for the delegation of this responsibility by the DAO towards the foundation.\n\n- HyperVue believes initiatives such as these as part of its primary roles and responsibilities towards the protocol and the DAO. \n\n- The majority of points programs being utilized currently have underperformed or not achieved the goal of what they’re intended to fully achieve. HyperVue is interested in exploring new and innovative ways to bring true value to the program for both the users as well as the stakeholders of the protocol.\n\n- The design and analysis of how points are rewarded to users very much reflect the amount of value they have brought to the product. We operate in good faith that the DAO recognizes these efforts done by the users as we are providing a means to measure their value. \n\n\n\n\n\n--------------\n\n\n\n**Specification / Proposal Details**\n\n\n\n- HyperVue will be collaborating with seasoned DeFi points design advisors to construct and refine the design of a points program catered toward the growth of the protocol.\n\n- The foundation will work alongside other contributors as well as partners of the protocol to identify key actions that aid in the usage and experience of the protocol for all users. \n\n- The foundation will host the server to maintain all database information and query actions done on the protocol for various UI’s to pull and display points on their respective products. Hypervue will take the necessary measures for data security and privacy measures to ensure users are protected and the data is not compromised.\n\n- Throughout the points program, the foundation will post frequent updates on key information such as actions that are eligible for points, and different phases of the program. \n\n- At the discretion of the HyperVue Foundation, when the points program ends, the results will be posted with distributions in a Protocol Proposal.\n\n- Upon the approval of delegation from the DAO to the Foundation, we are estimating to have the incentive points program running within 2-4 weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------\n\n## **Next Steps (Voting Outcome Summary)**\n\n\n\n1. HyperVue will take questions on the forum as well as Discord regarding the proposal.\n\n2. HyperVue will present the proposal and discuss the details in the next governance community call and conduct our AMA during the community call.\n\n3. We will create an ElementDAO Discord channel for the foundation to receive points feedback to continue to iterate on the program further. \n\n4. Implement the proposal on Snapshot.\n\n5. If Snapshot passes, the foundation will move forward with the steps required to deploy the points program and release further details on actions necessary to begin accruing Hyperdrive Points.",

      "content": "```\nEGP#: 34\nTitle: Service Proposal for Yield Sources Onboarding & Deployment to Other Chains and L2s\nAuthor: DELV\nType: Protocol Proposal\nStatus: Proposed\nDate Proposed: 2024-07-25\n```\n\n**References**\n\n- [EGP30: Hyperdrive Ethereum Mainnet Launch & Security Monitoring and Incident Management Services](https://forum.element.fi/discussion/23526-egp30-hyperdrive-ethereum-mainnet-launch-security-monitoring-and-incident-management-services)\n- [Hyperdrive Mainnet Analytics Dashboard](https://hyperdrive.blockanalitica.com/)\n- [EGP29: Hyperdrive Public Testnet Implementation for Element DAO](https://forum.element.fi/discussion/16635-egp29-hyperdrive-public-testnet-implementation-for-element-dao)\n- [Hyperdrive Testnet](https://testnet.hyperdrive.box/)\n- [Hyperdrive Whitepaper](https://github.com/delvtech/hyperdrive/blob/main/docs/Hyperdrive_Whitepaper.pdf)\n- [Hyperdrive Documentation Portal](https://docsdelv.gitbook.io/hyperdrive)\n- [Hyperdrive Security Reports](https://docsdelv.gitbook.io/hyperdrive/security/security-for-the-hyperdrive-protocol)\n\n**Proposal Glossary:**\n\n- **Factories:** Hyperdrive factories are used by governance systems to register the deployer coordinators for different Hyperdrive implementations, maintain a set of sane guards on the configurations used to deploy new pools, maintain a set of admin configurations (like the governance address, fee collector, and governance fees used by deployed pools), and collect the addresses of all of the pools that have been deployed.\n- **Deployer Coordinators:** Hyperdrive deployer coordinators abstract away the details of deploying specific implementations from a factory so that users can deploy pools with any of the factory’s registered implementations using the same functions in the Hyperdrive factories.\n- **Yield Sources:** Any interestbearing vault in which funds can be deposited to earn an interest rate. Hyperdrive markets are selectively built on trusted non-custodial DeFi yield sources.\n- **EGP34 Services:** The Yield Deployment Services and the Alt. Chain Deployment Services (each as defined in the Sentence Summary below) performed by DELV as a service provider to Element DAO.\n\n### Sentence Summary\n\nEGP-34 proposes that the Element DAO engages DELV as a service provider to (a) research, identify, select, and ship additional deployer coordinators to deploy further yield sources to Element DAO’s Ethereum Mainnet Hyperdrive deployment (the “Yield Deployment Services”) and (b) research, identify, select, and deploy other Hyperdrive instances for Element DAO on alternative chains, starting with Gnosis chain and then other chains and L2s (the “Alt. Chain Deployment Services”).\n\n### Paragraph Summary\n\nThis proposal is for a 90-day project term beginning the day the proposal has been accepted by the Element DAO (the “Service Term”), during which time DELV will perform the EGP-34 Services, as described further below, on a non-exclusive basis.\n\nThe EGP-34 Services are priced on a per-deployer coordinator basis (which includes factory deployments).\n\nNothing in this proposal limits the Element DAO’s ability to engage other service providers to perform similar services on behalf of the Element DAO or DELV’s ability to provide similar services to third parties.\n\n### Motivation\n\nNow that Element DAO and its governance members have voted to launch the Element DAO instance of Hyperdrive on Ethereum Mainnet, which officially launched on July 3rd, this proposal is being put forward to engage with DELV to perform the EGP-34 Services to add further yield sources to the Element DAO’s Ethereum Mainnet instance and deploy other Hyperdrive instances for the Element DAO to L2s and other chains.\n\n# **Scope of Work**\n\n### **1. Yield Source Onboarding & Timeline (EVM Compatible)**\n\nIn order to onboard additional EVM-compatible yield sources, DELV, as a prospective service provider to the Element DAO is proposing to remain as one of the `deployerCoordinatorManager`’s for the duration of the Service Term.\n\nThis is in line with DELV's currently active security monitoring and incident management service provision to the Element DAO ([EGP-30's Milestone 2](https://forum.element.fi/discussion/23526-egp30-hyperdrive-ethereum-mainnet-launch-security-monitoring-and-incident-management-services)) in which DELV will remain as one of the `DefaultPausers` for the duration of 90 days beginning July 3rd, 2024.\n\nAs for the yield source onboarding scope, all of the below deployer coordinators (and respective yield sources) will be deployed at a rate of approximately one per week starting the day this proposal is accepted by the Element DAO. DELV will announce on Discord and Twitter completed deployments under these EGP-34 Services to inform the Element DAO and its community that the relevant yield source or chain is live and available via DELV’s Hyperdrive UI.\n\nThis includes Ethereum Mainnet Deployer Coordinators (DCs) such as, but not limited to: \n- Renzo’s ezETH\n- Rocket Pool’s rETH\n- Ethena’s sUSDe\n- ether.fi's eETH\n- Morpho Blue - this enables anyone to deploy yield sources and pools such as:\n\t- Ethena USDe\n\t- Ethena sUSDe\n\t- wSTETH\n- AAVE - this enables anyone to deploy yield sources and pools such as:\n\t- Tether\n\t- USDC\n\n- **Note 1:** Deploying the DC for Aave and Morpho allows pools to be launched for any asset supported by those lending protocols.\n\n- **Note 2:** As we discover more yield source opportunities, this list will grow.\n\n- **Note 3:** DELV reserves the right to elect not to deploy a particular yield source.\n\n### **2. Chain Deployments & Respective Yield Source Onboarding Timeline**\n\nTo start, for the Element DAO to own and maintain this Hyperdrive instance, it will require a multisig wallet controlled by the Element DAO or the Governance Steering Council (GSC). Over time, the Element DAO may wish to consider other methods of maintaining these Hyperdrive instances. For instance, it may consider establishing voting vaults (such as an [L2-L1 Synthesis vault](https://github.com/delvtech/council-kit/wiki/Possible-Voting-Vault-Examples)) or other arrangements to manage these Hyperdrive instances. \n\n**Initial Alt. Chain deployment:** \n\n- **Gnosis Chain:**\n\t- x sDAI\n\t- WstETH\n\n**Further alternative chains and L2s that DELV expects to explore and possibly deploy to over the Service Term (not in any particular order):**\n- Arbitrum\n- Base / Optimism\n- Polygon\n- Mantle\n- Scroll\n- Others\n\nThese are the initially identified L2s and alternative chains DELV will assess for Hyperdrive instance deployment. As we continue to investigate other opportunities for Hyperdrive deployments and yield sources, we are interested to hear from the Element DAO community. However, it will ultimately be DELVs decision to proceed with any identified opportunities or not. The important thing to remember when identifying where to deploy is to look for trusted yield sources on the specific chains under consideration that enable promising Hyperdrive markets and pools. As always, just as DELV may engage with other projects to implement other instances of Hyperdrive, parties other than DELV may engage with the Element DAO community for deployments and yield sources.\n\n## **Element DAO’s Payment to DELV as a Service Provider**\n\nDELV will submit an onchain proposal to the Element DAO for the EGP-34 Services completed by DELV, in accordance with the following.\n\n- **Deployer Coordinator Pricing:** 100,000 ELFI per deployer coordinator\n\n\t- This pricing reflects DELV’s efforts in deploying the relevant yield source or chain / L2 (factory deployments). The Element DAO is not charged for DELV’s research, identification, or selection. This means DELV gets paid only for completed deployments under the EGP34 Services.\n\n- **Payment Schedule:**\n\n\t- At the end of the Service Term, DELV will submit a final onchain payment proposal and will continue services for the remainder of the Service Term if approved and executed.\n\n## **Next Steps (Voting Outcome Summary)**\n\n1. **EGP-34 is Posted on Element DAO Forum (July 25).**\n\n- a. DELV welcomes all questions and comments over the next week. Please be advised, DELV Team Members will not provide comments beyond formatting and technical commentary.\n\n- b. Once the feedback has been addressed, this will move to be officially Proposed.\n\n2. **1-Week Review Period**\n\n- Once EGP34 is proposed, there will be a 1-week review period before it moves to the next stage, Offchain Poll (Snapshot).\n\n3. **EGP-34 Moves to Snapshot (offchain poll)**\n\n- Because DELV will remain one of the `DeployerCoordinatorManager`s as proposed in the Scope of Work section of this proposal, the governance process for this proposal doesn’t require an Onchain vote or any execution from the Timelock. As such, the final vote will be this Offchain poll. Note that the payment proposal will require an Onchain vote but that will be submitted in accordance with the Payment Schedule section of this proposal.\n\n**3.1 On Snapshot, the governance community will vote for:**\n\n- a. **Yes:** You agree that EGP34 should be accepted.\n\n- b. **No:** You disagree that EGP34 should be accepted.\n\n- c. **Abstain:** You formally decline to vote either YES or NO.\n\n**3.2 Snapshot Voting Period Ends (Offchain Poll)**.\n\n- If this proposal passes the Offchain Poll, EGP34 will be formally approved and accepted by Element DAO governance **(August 6)**.\n\n**Important note:** DELV will provide logistical and technical support for putting the proposals offchain (poll) and onchain (vote), but neither DELV nor DELV Team Members will participate in the poll or vote. Furthermore, DELV engineers will provide technical comments only, when clarity is needed; they will not provide any statements on the wisdom or appropriateness of the proposal.",

      "content": "```\n\nEGP#: 31\n\nTitle: Foundation Update and ELFI Request\n\nAuthor(s): HyperVue Foundation\n\nType: Protocol Proposal\n\nStatus: Proposed\n\nDate Proposed: 2024-07-05\n\nDate Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>\n\n```\n\n## **Summary of Topics**\n\n - Rebranding and transition to the HyperVue Foundation\n\n - Foundation team background\n\n - ELFI request details\n\n - HyperVue Foundation participation in governance\n\n - Next steps\n\n## **Paragraph Summary**\n\nThis proposal is being submitted by the HyperVue Foundation (Formerly Element Foundation), a Cayman Islands entity created alongside the launch of the Element DAO in 2021 to aid and support the decisions proposed and made by stakeholders and owners of the Element protocol (ELFI holders & community members). \n\nAs we begin a new chapter in line with the mainnet deployment of the Hyperdrive, the next version of the Element Protocol, the Foundation gears towards assisting the DAO and protocol to reach their full potential. \n\n## **Rebranding and Transition to the HyperVue Foundation**\n\nIn conjunction with the launch of the Hyperdrive Protocol on mainnet, the Element Foundation has rebranded to become the HyperVue Foundation. \n\nThe rebrand serves as a cornerstone for our engagement with stakeholders, partners, and the broader community, ensuring that the Foundation effectively conveys the innovative vision of the Protocol and its continuous growth.\n\nTrue to the initial mandate, the Foundation is committed to identifying and providing solutions for various gaps and potential friction points within the DAO or the protocol. Those things include but are not limited to:\n\n- Assisting in facilitating grants and deploying support towards builders, partners, organizers, researchers, and others to further Protocol growth.\n\n- Improving governance processes and providing different solutions to create a better overall experience in the decision-making process of the DAO and the Protocol.\n\n- Methods of growing the Protocol’s ecosystem.\n\n- Supporting research of various products alongside partners to further scale the Protocol.\n\n## **Foundation Team & Board**\n\n[Windra Thio](https://x.com/WindraThio), Executive Director (ED)\n\nAs the Executive Director of the Foundation, Windra will be tasked with navigating its overall direction and executing its goals with the assistance of the Board. \n\nWindra was a co-founding team member of Element and led the strategy and growth efforts of Protocol Version 1.\n\n[Re’em Sal](https://x.com/shimonsal), Head of Growth\n\nAs the Head of Growth of the Foundation, Re’em will oversee all Foundation growth initiatives in ecosystem development and governance strategy.\n\nRe’em is one of the Protocol's longest-tenured community members. He was one of the co-founders of Component and has been an active participant in the DAO since its inception.\n\n**Board Members:**\n\nThe current Foundation’s board members will be comprised of the following individuals:\n\n[Diederik Loerakker](https://x.com/protolambda) (proto), Protocol Researcher at [OPLabsPBC](https://x.com/OPLabsPBC), previously Ethereum Foundation.\n\n[Tim Beiko](https://x.com/TimBeiko), Ethereum Foundation\n\n[Scott Moore](https://x.com/notscottmoore), Co-founder of [Gitcoin](https://twitter.com/gitcoin) & [kernel0x](https://twitter.com/kernel0x)\n\n[Mariano Conti](https://twitter.com/nanexcool), Former Head of Smart Contracts at [MakerDAO](https://twitter.com/MakerDAO)\n\n**Advisors:**\n\n[Simona Pop](https://twitter.com/sim_pop), Advisor for Optimism Foundation, ENS Public Goods Lead Stewart, previously co-founder of [ETH Bounties](https://twitter.com/ethBounties) and governance strategy [Gitcoin](https://twitter.com/gitcoin).\n\n**The Foundation team will continue to expand as we look for suitable individuals and discover roles in the future, but the tentative plans are to fill the roles of:**\n\nFoundation Ecosystem and Community Team: \n\n- Tasked with generating community engagement and growth through various online and offline events.\n\nGrants Lead: \n\n- Streamline a grants process and aid in grants application management, which is necessary for the Protocol’s ecosystem.\n\nGovernance Lead: \n\n- Support various delegates, GSC members, and individual voters. \n\n- Continue to assist in seeking out new qualified candidates for the GSC and further encourage voter participation and activity. \n\nFoundation Tech and Security Team: \n\n- Assist in the execution of various necessary proposals. \n\n- Ensure the technical execution of the Foundation is secure and safe. \n\n- Manage the relationships of the developers and builders within the Protocol’s Ecosystem.\n\nFinance:\n\n- Manage the finances, treasury, and budgeting of the Foundation. \n\nThe team's 3-year scaling plan includes budgeting for **ten full-time employees, three advisors, and five board members.**\n\n## **Budget**\n\nThe Foundation is **requesting 10m in ELFI**. The expected allocation of the Foundation’s total treasury is laid out as follows:\n\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreid5lzjmpmnvmd4jzbjyv52wxs5hhakphiafdwcbpdqajn2b2pdp64)\n\nSome of the initiatives we are already currently looking to push forward include:\n\n\n\n1) A defined and clear direction with how the DAO governs the Hyperdrive Protocol.\n\n2) Initiatives to further encourage Governance participation for the GSC and community members.\n\n3) Exploration for distribution avenues to further the decentralization of the protocol and its voters. \n\n\n\nThis amount, along with our current treasury, will allow us to sustain the Foundation for the next three years, subject to any unforeseen circumstances. We plan to revisit this topic and request additional ELFI if we feel the necessity to do so.\n\n\n\nThe total ask amount is the estimated total amount of ELFI we believe is necessary to accomplish our mission of ensuring the success of the DAO as well as its stakeholders. Following three years of operation, should the foundation and the DAO have strong reasons to believe that the DAO is sufficiently operational and can achieve all of its goals and missions without the necessity of HyperVue, the foundation will begin taking steps towards winding down and returning all of the unused ELFI to the DAO. \n\n\n\nIf traction is strong and the foundation proves to be successful in achieving its goals from the perspective of the foundation as well as the community, we may make an additional request to extend our budgeted amount beyond the three years after an initial assessment of 12 months of operation.\n\n\n\n## **HyperVue Foundation’s Participation in Governance**\n\n\n\nAs we are an external entity, as are any other entities serviced and incentivized to assist the decisions made by the DAO and the Protocol, we are requesting that initially, 20% of our requested amount (2m ELFI) be utilized primarily as tokens for delegation to various community members to participate and aide in the governance process of the DAO. However, the Foundation may also choose to self-delegate to vote on various proposals. \n\n\n\n### **Proposed Code**\n\n\n\nThe proposed code will be added soon.\n\n\n\n## **Test Cases**\n\n\n\nPrevious proposals have transferred ELFI before.\n\n\n\n## Next Steps (Voting Outcome Summary)\n\nWe plan to discuss all the above with the community as it undergoes the comment phase of the process. If remarks and sentiment are positive, the proposal will move to an off-chain snapshot vote, which will be followed by an on-chain proposal.\n\n**Additionally, to answer anyone’s questions, Windra (Executive Director) will be present to take questions and discuss the proposal in the upcoming DAO Community Call on July 11th, 2024 and will be available in the Element DAO discord @Windra.**\n\n1. **Foundation Update and ELFI Request Proposal Posted on Element DAO Forum (July 5th).**\n     a. We welcome all questions and comments over the next week.\n     b. Once the feedback has been addressed, this will move to be officially Proposed.\n\n2. **Once Proposed, there will be a 1 week review period before it moves to the next stage, Offchain Poll (Snapshot).**\n\n3. **Foundation Update and ELFI Request Proposal Snapshot (Offchain Poll)**\n    - On Snapshot, the governance community will vote for:\n        I. **Yes:** You agree that the HyperVue Foundation should be granted 10m ELFI.\n        II. **No:** You disagree that the HyperVue Foundation should be granted 10m ELFI.\n        III. **Abstain:** You formally decline to vote either YES or NO.\n    - Snapshot Voting Period Ends (Off-chain Poll). If this proposal passes the Off-Chain Poll, it will proceed to the On-chain Vote, where the vote options will remain the same as on Snapshot.\n\n4. **Foundation Update and ELFI Request Proposal On-chain Vote**\n      a. On-chain Voting Period Ends\n      b. If this proposal passes, the proposal will officially be Accepted and the code will proceed to the Execution stage (Timelock) where the HyperVue Foundation will receive the requested ELFI.\n\n5. **Foundation Update and ELFI Request Proposal Timelock Execution**\n     a. Once the Timelock has passed, the HyperVue Foundation will receive the requested ELFI.",

Deployment of an Element DAO instance of the Hyperdrive protocol and 6-month pool deployments for stETH and sDAI to Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n2. For 90 days, security monitoring and incident management of the Element DAO instance of the Hyperdrive protocol and responding to potential security issues.\n\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\n\n\nThe Hyperdrive Public Testnet was the first public introduction of Hyperdrive for people to contribute to its research and development, and provide valuable feedback – all without putting real assets on the line.\n\n\n\nWhen ‘EGP-29: Hyperdrive Public Testnet Implementation for Element DAO’ was put forward, it came with the following goals:\n\n\n\n- Understand Hyperdrive\n\n- Learn how to manage Hyperdrive from the governance point of view\n\n- Receive feedback\n\n- Review and test the Hyperdrive Protocol Smart Contracts\n\n- Run bots\n\n\n\nNow, over the past two months, we've seen over 6,000 unique wallets using the testnet, over 50,000 events across Longs, Shorts, and LP'ing, and trading volume reaching 1.5B through all markets. On top of that, Hyperdrive itself has improved greatly from feedback on the protocol codebase, documentation, and UI. Overall, the Hyperdrive Testnet experiment has been a huge success.\n\n\n\nNow it is up to the Element DAO governance members to decide on the next steps for launching an Element DAO instance of Hyperdrive live on Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n\n\n# Milestones\n\n\n\n### Scope of Work (Milestones)\n\n\n\n1. **Milestone 1: Deployment of Element DAO Instance of Hyperdrive (and Pools) to Ethereum Mainnet** \n\n    - DELV will develop, deploy, and launch an Element DAO instance of Hyperdrive with 6-month pools on top of stETH and sDAI on Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n2. **Milestone 2: Security Monitoring and Incident Management (90 days)**\n\n    - 90 Days Completed of Security Monitoring and Incident Management Following Proposal Effective Date\n\n        1. On behalf of the Element DAO, DELV will monitor, for a 90-day period, the health and safety of the Hyperdrive deployments. This includes, but is not limited to the following areas: \n\n            1. Yield Source Hacks\n\n            2. Hyperdrive Trading Vulnerabilities\n\n            3. Hyperdrive Non-Trading Vulnerabilities\n\n            4. Negative Interest Events (e.g., slashing events)\n\n            5. Checkpoint minting failures\n\n            6. Sunsetting Pools\n\n\n\n### Element DAO’s Payments to DELV as a Service Provider\n\n\n\nPayment Schedule for services provided is based on two milestones: \n\n\n\n1. **Milestone 1: Deployment of Element DAO Instance of Hyperdrive (and Pools) to Ethereum Mainnet** \n\n    - DELV will push up an onchain payment proposal for Milestone 1 shortly after EGP-30 has been put forward.\n\n    - Once the first onchain payment proposal has been approved and executed, DELV will officially transfer ownership of this instance of the Hyperdrive deployments on Ethereum Mainnet to the Element DAO.\n\n    - **Payment Details:**\n\n        - Development, Deployment and Transfer: 4,000,000 ELFI\n\n2. **Milestone 2: Security Monitoring and Incident Management (90 days)**\n\n    - Once the Security Monitoring and Incident Management has been in effect for thirty days, DELV will push up a final onchain payment proposal and will continue services for the remainder of the 90 days if approved and executed.\n\n    - **Payment Details:**\n\n        - Security Monitoring and Incident Management: 2,000,000 ELFI\n\n\n## **For Specification, Proposed Code, Test Cases and so on, please read further in the forums:**\n\nhttps://forum.element.fi/discussion/23526-egp30-hyperdrive-ethereum-mainnet-launch-security-monitoring-and-incident-management-services\n\n\n## **Next Steps (Voting Outcome Summary)**\n\n\n\n1. **EGP-30: DELV Proposal for Hyperdrive Mainnet Launch & Security Monitoring and Incident Management Services Posted on Element DAO Forum (June 19th).**\n\n    a. DELV welcomes all questions and comments over the next week, but please be advised that DELV Team Members will not provide comments beyond formatting and technical commentary.\n\n    b. Once the feedback has been addressed, this will move to be officially Proposed.\n\n2. **Once EGP-30 is Proposed, there will be a 1 week review period before it moves to the next stage, Offchain Poll (Snapshot).**\n\n3. **EGP-30 Moves to Snapshot (Offchain Poll)**\n\n\n*Because DELV will be handling the deployment process and then (after receipt of payment from the DAO) transferring ownership over to the Element DAO later, this proposal’s governance process doesn't require an onchain vote or any execution from the Timelock. As such, the final vote will be this Offchain poll.* \n\n    \n\n  a. On Snapshot, the governance community will vote for:\n\n   i. **Yes:** You agree that EGP-30 should be accepted.\n\n   ii. **No:** You disagree that EGP-30 should be accepted.\n\n   iii. **Abstain:** You formally decline to vote either YES or NO.\n\nb. **Snapshot Voting Period Ends (Off-chain Poll):**\n\n   i.

      "content": "```\n\nEGP#: 29\n\nTitle: Hyperdrive Public Testnet Implementation for Element DAO\n\nAuthor(s): DELV\n\nType: Protocol Proposal\n\nStatus: <Assigned by GSC or Forum moderators >\n\nDate Proposed: 2024-03-14\n\nDate Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>\n\n```\n\n\n\n## **References**\n\n\n\n- [Introducing the Hyperdrive Protocol: Fixed and Variable Rates, Reimagined (Blog Post)](https://blog.delv.tech/introducing-the-hyperdrive-protocol-fixed-and-variable-rates-reimagined/)\n\n- [Hyperdrive Security Update: Pre-Testnet Audit Reports are in!](https://blog.delv.tech/hyperdrive-security-update-pre-testnet-audit-reports-are-in/)\n\n- Open Source Hyperdrive Protocol [Codebase](https://www.github.com/delvtech/hyperdrive/)\n\n\n\n## **Sentence Summary**\n\n\n\nDELV is creating this governance proposal to deploy a Hyperdrive Public Testnet Implementation for Element DAO on the Sepolia Ethereum Testnet. \n\n\n\n## **Paragraph Summary**\n\n\n\nThis proposal includes the details for deploying the Public Testnet Implementation to Sepolia Ethereum Testnet and running a Hyperdrive UI for users to learn and get educated about how Hyperdrive works, get familiar with the UX of Hyperdrive, and provide feedback on all aspects of the experience.\n\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\n\n\nHyperdrive is the next-generation AMM protocol for fixed and variable rates in DeFi. Should the Element DAO decide to adopt an instantiation of Hyperdrive as a base protocol on which to build new product offerings, users (of Hyperdrive and the users of Element DAO governance) must learn and understand how it works and be fluent in the process of deploying new markets, integrating yield sources, building new products, and adjusting all the necessary parameters to set Hyperdrive up effectively.\n\n\n\nThis Hyperdrive Public Testnet will be users’ first chance to experience Hyperdrive firsthand, contribute to its research and development, and provide valuable feedback – all without putting real assets on the line. We read all feedback we receive and take it seriously so we can get things right.\n\n\n\n**Public Testnet Goals:** \n\n\n\n- **Learn how to manage Hyperdrive from the governance point of view:** A public testnet deployed and controlled by the Element DAO and its members gives the opportunity to test-flight the management of a Hyperdrive deployment - such as management of pool deployments, setting of parameters, and setting fee structures.\n\n- **Learn Hyperdrive:** Familiarize yourself with Hyperdrive and its concepts.\n\n- **Provide Feedback:** Share your thoughts on the interface, experience, bots, and existing documentation/guides. Feel free to share your thoughts in the Element DAO Discord server.\n\n- **Review and test the Hyperdrive Protocol Smart Contracts:** The smart contracts are open source and ready for review. Check out the codebase [here](https://github.com/delvtech/hyperdrive).\n\n- **Run Bots (if you can):** We’ve put together a [Hyperdrive bots tutorial](https://github.com/delvtech/agent0/blob/main/examples/tutorial.ipynb) where you can get familiar with the process and with the open source tools we’ve provided for developing and running your own trading bots.\n\n\n\nOnce the users (Hyperdrive users and governance users) of the public testnet have had a chance to test-drive Hyperdrive, they’ll be better positioned to design product offerings based on its technology and to create fee structures that make sense for all participants. \n\n\n\nThis testnet deployment aims for the Element DAO to experiment with Hyperdrive as an additional tool with which to create new DeFi products. Once the testnet is live, DELV will analyze usage data and publicly share insights gathered from this test run. However, it is up to the Element DAO to decide on the next steps.\n\n\n\n**Important note:** DELV will provide logistical and technical support for putting the proposals off-chain (poll) and on-chain (vote), but neither DELV nor DELV Team Members will participate in the poll or vote. Furthermore, DELV engineers will provide technical comments only, when clarity is needed; they will not provide any statements on the wisdom or appropriateness of the proposal.\n\n\n\n## **For Specification, Proposed Code, Test Cases and so on, please read further in the forums:**\n\nhttps://forum.element.fi/discussion/16635-egp29-hyperdrive-public-testnet-implementation-for-element-dao\n\n\n## **Next Steps (Voting Outcome Summary)**\n\n\n\n1. **Public Testnet Proposal Posted on Element DAO Forum (March 14). This proposal is currently a Draft.**\n\n    1. We welcome all questions and comments over the next week, but please be advised that DELV Team Members will not provide comments beyond formatting and technical commentary.\n\n    2. Once the feedback has been addressed, this will move to be officially Proposed.\n\n2. **Once Proposed, there will be a 1 week review period before it moves to the next stage, Offchain Poll (Snapshot).**\n\n3. **Public Testnet Governance Proposal Testnet Snapshot (Offchain Poll)**\n\n    1. On Snapshot, the governance community will vote for:\n\n        1. **Yes:** You agree that the Hyperdrive Public Testnet should go live.\n\n        2. **No:** You disagree that the Hyperdrive Public Testnet should go live.\n\n        3. **Abstain:** You formally decline to vote either YES or NO.\n\n    2. Testnet Snapshot Voting Period Ends (Off-chain Poll). If this proposal passes the Off-Chain Poll, it will proceed to the Onchain Vote, where the vote options will remain the same as on Snapshot.\n\n4. **Public Testnet Governance Proposal Onchain Vote**\n\n    1. Onchain Voting Period Ends\n\n    2. If this proposal passes, the proposal will officially be Accepted and the code will proceed to the Execution stage (Timelock) where the Public Testnet implementation of Hyperdrive will be queued to go live.\n\n5. **Public Testnet Governance Proposal Timelock Execution**\n\n    1. Once the Timelock has passed, the Public Testnet Implementation of Hyperdrive will be officially deployed and live on Sepolia!",

The vesting cliff was defined as one year from the launch date and the token vesting schedule defined was as three years after the launch date.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nThe purpose of this EGP is to regain the unvested token allocations that were given to previously employed DELV Team Members, allowing DELV to be able to award new token grants to new employees and contributors.\n\nImportant note: DELV will place this proposal on chain (if it reaches that stage of governance), but neither DELV nor DELV Team Members will vote on this proposal. Furthermore, DELV engineers will provide purely technical comments only; they will not provide any statements on the wisdom or appropriateness of the proposal.\n\nSpecification\n-------------\n\nThe VestingVault contract holds grants for various holders of the ELFI governance token. For reasons stated in the Motivation section, some grants need to be adjusted. This adjustment takes the form of updating two variables: `allocation` and `range`. `allocation` is what it sounds like, the number of tokens awarded after the grants vest. `range` refers to the specific token range to which the grants apply. As the allocations are reduced, the ranges need to be updated as well. If there is no range specified, it is left unspecified. Furthermore, as allocations are reduced, we update the `unassigned` value by the amount the allocation is reduced. This proposal makes no assumption about the future use of the now unassigned tokens in the VestingVault will be used.\n\nProposed Code\n-------------\n\nAs a part of this proposal, a contract will be used to perform the necessary modifications to existing token grants. This contract can be viewed here: [https://github.com/sentilesdal/council/contracts/vaults/UnfrozenVestingVault.sol](https://github.com/sentilesdal/council/blob/main/contracts/vaults/UnfrozenVestingVault.sol)\n\nOnly the method that will be called is `reduceGrant()`.\n\nScripts in the above-mentioned repository will be used to deploy the upgraded contract and create and execute the proposal.\n\nThe basic idea of the proposal is that, from the `Timelock` contract, the following three actions will be performed on the VestingVault:\n\n1.  Upgrade the proxy implementation of the VestingVault.\n2.  Update `allocation` to the new amount. If the new value is zero, delete the grant. If a `range` is specified, update that value as well.\n3.  Reset the proxy implementation of the VestingVault.\n\nYou can see the proposed values here for the creation of the proposal, assuming the proposer uses only the locking vault to satisfy the minimum voting power threshold to create the proposal.\n\n```\n{\n \"proposalId\": 11,\n \"votingVaults\": [\n  \"0x02Bd4A3b1b95b01F2Aa61655415A5d3EAAcaafdD\"\n ],\n \"extraVaultData\": [\n  \"0x00\"\n ],\n \"targets\": [\n  \"0x81758f3361A769016eae4844072FA6d7f828a651\"\n ],\n \"callDatas\": [\n  \"0x88b49b8392069f208fc38d865c56166ac46dac5702d41e4551bb4462de2765023ad68dd5\"\n ],\n \"proposalHash\": \"0x5ee0fd08dadf12291e94d59a9ab3310e004ccde3ec967b84855921cbc55ddfb1\",\n // all targets are the VestingVault proxy contract.\n \"targetsTimeLock\": [\n  \"0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A\",\n  \"0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A\",\n  \"0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A\",\n  \"0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A\",\n  \"0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A\",\n  \"0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A\",\n  \"0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A\"\n ],\n // function signatures are upgradeProxy,reduceGrant[],upgradeProxy\n \"calldatasTimeLock\": [\n  \"0x74474d2800000000000000000000000038dbc89fc52948192843920e78c8b609474b60b4\",\n  \"0xf9c251a7000000000000000000000000fb18b8f2bbe88c4c29ca5a12ee404db4d640fe4e000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c5e76e895786ec80000\",\n  \"0xf9c251a70000000000000000000000004103672489e420076b012dda2ba2b0c414d985ca000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008c79d8ff876c616c0000\",\n  \"0xf9c251a7000000000000000000000000fb0e31b422e606ca996e4415243ebf15c2e5535e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006eb1c65b9679d730000\",\n  \"0xf9c251a700000000000000000000000084ad922d23a7613e0d25f36cb65cd5f92a155110000000000000000000000000000000000000000000041e6305ae73f1619b0000\",\n  \"0xf9c251a7000000000000000000000000e68e82c3c49df3d9c8b04b0bb8e5f1cdc28dae520000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\",\n  \"0x74474d28000000000000000000000000716d4e863536ac862ad34bc4ecacba07d8831bea\"\n ],\n \"callHashTimelock\": \"0x92069f208fc38d865c56166ac46dac5702d41e4551bb4462de2765023ad68dd5\",\n // TBD, will actually be 2 weeks from on chain creation.\n \"lastCall\": 18572742,\n \"ballot\": \"2\"\n}\n\n```\n\nTest Cases\n----------\n\nThe code will be dry-run using Ethereum mainnet forks. Values will be inspected to make sure that they make sense and yield the intended results.\n\nThe following should be true AFTER the proposal is executed:\n\n-   All the targeted grants have expected allocations\n-   All targeted grants with range values have updated the range as expected\n-   Allocations that are now zero are deleted from storage\n-   NO other values should change except `allocation` and `range`\n\nSecurity Considerations\n-----------------------\n\n-   There are several security considerations with this proposal. Most importantly, this proposal will make changes to existing token grants in the vesting vault and is therefore very sensitive. Extra care should be taken to make sure that updated values in the created proposal align with intentions.\n-   The other security concern is with the smart contract used to perform the modifications to the token grants. This contract should go under audit and review to ensure that it only performs the desired changes to the smart contract and that it has no unintended consequences.\n\nTechnical Review Plan or Audit Information (If already available)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe code for this proposal is publicly available for the community to review at <https://github.com/sentilesdal/council>. Engineers at DELV have conducted internal reviews of both the smart contract updates and the code used to generate the proposal. After the proposal is made public, there should be ample time to allow the community to audit the code.\n\nNext Steps (Voting Outcome Summary)\n-----------------------------------\n\n1.  This proposal is currently a `Draft`.\n    1.  We welcome all questions and comments over the next week, but please be advised that DELV Team Members will not be able to provide comments beyond formatting and technical commentary.\n2.  Once the feedback has been addressed, this will move to be officially `Proposed`.\n3.  Once Proposed, there will be a 1 week review period before it moves to the next stage, Off-Chain Poll (Snapshot).\n4.  On Snapshot, the governance community will vote for:\n    1.  Yes: You agree that the token grants for departed DELV team members should be removed/reclaimed.\n    2.  No: You disagree that the token grants for departed DELV team members should be removed/reclaimed.\n    3.  Abstain: formally decline to vote either YES or NO.\n5.  If this proposal passes the Off-Chain Poll, it will proceed to the On-chain Vote, where the vote options will remain the same as on Snapshot.\n6.  If this proposal passes, the proposal will officially be Accepted and the code will proceed to the Execution stage where the previously allocated token grants will be removed/reclaimed.",

If, at the end of the voting period, quorum is reached, the Manifesto as a whole will be considered passed, effective immediately.\n\n\n# Motivation\nThis manifesto is intended as an explicit foundation for the existence, governance and focus of Element DAO. Its role is to clarify and codify the DAO’s intention, purpose and core values in order to inform community conduct, governance flow and the evolution of this DAO.\n\n\n# Manifesto\n\nThis manifesto is intended as an explicit foundation for the existence, governance and focus of Element DAO. Its role is to clarify and codify the DAO’s intention, purpose and core values in order to inform community conduct, governance flow and the evolution of this DAO.\n\nFrom the very start, the core team’s commitment to true decentralization has been paramount in the shaping of the DAO and the protocol itself. It is the key principle underpinning how we work and what we work on. The centralization of the current world has shown us time and time again just how risky it can be. So perhaps better decisions are made through the collective set of stakeholders, users, and contributors as those who find the most value in the protocol will be able to most apt at determining its future.\n\n## Decentralized finance should be democratized finance.\n\nThe driving force for the people in this DAO is that what we’re building is bigger than ourselves. All our decisions should be motivated by an effort to evolve the DeFi space as a whole, not just the Element protocol. A collaborative, creative and innovative drive to engage all the relevant stakeholders, sincerely and responsibly addressing risks, and acting together for the long-term is what will lead us to where we hope to go.\n\nAnd finally, we are not afraid. Of the unknown, of failure, of what we’ll learn together on the way. We’ll do everything we can to avoid echo chambers and taking the easy, well-traveled path. \nIt’s all elementary after all. \n\n## Our Purpose\n\nThe Purpose of the Element DAO is to steward the growth, maintenance, and improvement to the Element Protocol.\n\nThis is the North Star of the DAO, guiding the actions, decisions and progress of this organism. All decisions across the DAO should be made with this purpose in mind.\n\nWe grow: Increase protocol usage and collaborations\nWe maintain: Fix, update, upgrade\nWe improve: Invest in research and innovation at protocol and governance level\n\n## Our Values\n\nThese are the beliefs and principles that drive us. They guide and impact the community experience as well as the relationship the DAO holds with its contributors, stakeholders and core members.\n\nTransparency:\nWe build and make decisions in public\n\nSecurity:\nWe create and maintain security measures that protect the protocol mechanism, the token holders and protocol depositors\n\nIntegrity: \nWe abide by strong moral principles and commit to honesty in all actions\n\nAccessibility:\nWe foster a collaborative and easily navigable space supportive of a broad community\n\n## Our focus\nFocus is all about achieving clarity in what we do.

      "content": "EGP-24\nTitle: Reclaim (Clawback) unclaimed voting rights that have been distributed\nAuthor(s): Windra\nType: Protocol Proposal\nStatus: Proposed\nDate Proposed: <2023-02-08>\nDate Ratified: \n\nSentence Summary\n\n-   Reclaim the unclaimed voting rights (ELFI) from the initial distribution event and direct it back to the DAO Treasury.\n\nParagraph Summary\n\n-   On March 31st, 2022 the Element Labs team distributed voting rights to various different parties, users, and individuals deemed qualified to participate in the DAO operations and voting of the newly formed Element DAO. Close to a year later, a decent % of the distributed voting rights have still not been claimed and utilized as intended. This proposal is to suggest that the unclaimed voting rights ought to be reclaimed by the Element DAO to be re-distributed into the right hands via grants, participants, DAO contributors, liquidity programs, rewards, bounties, etc.\n\nMotivation\n\n-   Some of the motivation behind this proposal is to redirect voting rights (ELFI) from the uninterested (users who did not claim) to the ones who are active contributors of the DAO and the protocol. The initial distribution event covered a wide array of different protocols, users, and contributors of the Ethereum network, but a vast majority of those who were optimistically given the opportunity to participate are indifferent towards it.\n\n-   The simplest solution towards this issue is to allow the DAO to decide where the unclaimed voting rights ought to be distributed towards instead of the unclaimed ELFI being stuck / unclaimed for an unknown period of time (possibly forever).\n\nSpecification\n\nProposed technical solution would be to look at the distribution smart contracts to see what the total amount is unclaimed, and send that amount to the DAO.\n\nProposed Code\n\nStep 1:\n\nThat the governance contract should burn the tokens from these contracts:\n\nAirdrop: 0xd04a459FFD3A5E3C93d5cD8BB13d26a9845716c2\n\nZkAirdrop1: 0x5ae69B714859A3C15281e0a227D9B8C82F03b966\n\nZkAirdrop2: 0x63A2548f0a3795a35Ff62121E5f8C24Ada9831F8\n\nZkAirdrop3: 0x72D3acDAd21dF959DB2C112A0a5982d03759a154\n\nZkAirdrop4: 0x508071cEEf3d24D94b6783c0808fe1A417DDa485\n\nZkAirdrop5: 0x805bb52e4D9795B44C1ecd191Bd31F1D4a9C2dA5\n\nZkAirdrop6: 0xb7726ee8d589fd3e74C0369aB8F08D5d847bC86A\n\nStep 2:\n\nThen mint a corresponding number to the treasury contract 0x82eF450FB7f06E3294F2f19ed1713b255Af0f541\n\nStep 3:\n\nCode for the contract:\n\npragma solidity ^0.8.15;\n\ninterface ELFI {\n\n    function burn(address account, uint256 amount) external;\n\n    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external;\n\n    function setOwner(address who) external;\n\n    function balanceOf(address who) external returns(uint256);\n\n}\n\ncontract AirdropReclaim {\n\n    ELFI constant elfi = ELFI(0x5c6D51ecBA4D8E4F20373e3ce96a62342B125D6d);\n\n    function reclaim() external {\n\n        uint256 total = 0;\n\n        address[] memory toDelete = new address[](7);\n\n        toDelete[0] = 0xd04a459FFD3A5E3C93d5cD8BB13d26a9845716c2;\n\n        toDelete[1] = 0x5ae69B714859A3C15281e0a227D9B8C82F03b966;\n\n        toDelete[2] = 0x63A2548f0a3795a35Ff62121E5f8C24Ada9831F8;\n\n        toDelete[3] = 0x72D3acDAd21dF959DB2C112A0a5982d03759a154;\n\n        toDelete[4] = 0x508071cEEf3d24D94b6783c0808fe1A417DDa485;\n\n        toDelete[5] = 0x805bb52e4D9795B44C1ecd191Bd31F1D4a9C2dA5;\n\n        toDelete[6] = 0xb7726ee8d589fd3e74C0369aB8F08D5d847bC86A;\n\n        for (uint256 i = 0; i < toDelete.length; i++) {\n\n            uint256 toBeDeleted = elfi.balanceOf(toDelete[i]);\n\n            elfi.burn(toDelete[i], toBeDeleted);\n\n            total += toBeDeleted;\n\n        }\n\n        elfi.mint(0x82eF450FB7f06E3294F2f19ed1713b255Af0f541, total);\n\n        elfi.setOwner(0x81758f3361A769016eae4844072FA6d7f828a651);\n\n    }\n\n}\n\nTest Cases\n\n-   N/A\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\n-   N/A\n\nTechnical Review Plan or Audit Information (If already available)\n\n-   N/A\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI would like to have a discussion about this with anyone who has a perspective on the subject.

The vesting cliff was defined as 1-year from the launch date and the token vesting schedule defined was as three years after the launch date.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nThe purpose of this EGP is to regain the token allocations that were given to previously employed Element team members, allowing Element Finance to be able to award new token grants to new employees and contributors.\n\nImportant note: Neither Element Finance, Inc. nor Element Finance Team members will vote on this proposal. Furthermore, Element engineers will provide purely technical comments only; they will not provide any statements on the wisdom or appropriateness of the proposal.\n\nSpecification\n-------------\n\nThe VestingVault contract holds grants for various holders of the ELFI governance token. For reasons stated in the Motivation section, some grants need to be adjusted. This adjustment takes the form of updating two variables: `allocation` and `range`. `allocation` is what it sounds like, the number of tokens awarded after the grants vest. `range` refers to the specific token range to which the grants apply. As the allocations are reduced, the ranges need to be updated as well. If there is no range specified, it is left unspecified. Furthermore, as allocations are reduced, we update the `unassigned` value by the amount the allocation is reduced. This proposal makes no assumption about the future use of the now unassigned tokens in the VestingVault will be used.\n\nProposed Code\n-------------\n\nAs a part of this proposal, a contract will be used to perform the necessary modifications to existing token grants. This contract can be viewed here: [https://github.com/sentilesdal/council/contracts/vaults/UnfrozenVestingVault.sol](https://github.com/sentilesdal/council/blob/main/contracts/vaults/UnfrozenVestingVault.sol)\n\nOnly the method that will be called is `reduceGrant()`.\n\nScripts in the above-mentioned repository will be used to deploy the upgraded contract and create and execute the proposal.\n\nThe basic idea of the proposal is that, from the `Timelock` contract, the following three actions will be performed on the VestingVault:\n\n1.  Upgrade the proxy implementation of the VestingVault.\n2.  Update `allocation` to the new amount. If the new value is zero, delete the grant. If a `range` is specified, update that value as well.\n3.  Reset the proxy implementation of the VestingVault.\n\nYou can see the proposed values here for the creation of the proposal, assuming the proposer uses only the locking vault to satisfy the minimum voting power threshold to create the proposal.\n\n```\nproposalId 4\nvotingVaults [ '0x02Bd4A3b1b95b01F2Aa61655415A5d3EAAcaafdD' ]\nextraVaultData [ '0x00' ]\ntargets [ '0x81758f3361A769016eae4844072FA6d7f828a651' ]\ncallDatas [\n'0x88b49b8323a321f19d23a56e2a186b370738326477c0d9a5c6e7ecbdf1416455964e61b9'\n]\nproposalHash '0x80b54ecedfb8f4bddb77eda29bea0fe077ad1dfdd10be1e92f75f3e08b6a2869'\ntargetsTimeLock [\n'0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A',\n'0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A',\n'0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A',\n'0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A',\n'0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A',\n'0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A',\n'0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A',\n'0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A',\n'0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A',\n'0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A',\n'0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A',\n'0x6De73946eab234F1EE61256F10067D713aF0e37A'\n]\ncalldatasTimeLock [\n'0x74474d280000000000000000000000001d13ff25b10c9a6741dfdce229073bed652197c7',\n'0xf9c251a7000000000000000000000000561c1693fd7c874763f99d0f456c0d2353c85e26000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002e69aae2e8c354700000',\n'0xf9c251a70000000000000000000000007c9c99a9c0bb31c054de1bd9af546db10e35785b000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000f50f3528cc0b22d0000',\n'0xf9c251a70000000000000000000000003a543655e484d9ad9ada138170254f5880b695ce0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',\n'0xf9c251a70000000000000000000000009814ca52e5235e9ea7709475893645bed9a9cf430000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',\n'0xf9c251a7000000000000000000000000b603613b9e3f76ab26ce2a259f1db8ea5e9dc5950000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',\n'0xf9c251a700000000000000000000000046aa35190959c7a639ada37a99068b6740a0a5ed0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',\n'0xf9c251a700000000000000000000000008627fcb1edd7006b9f71fbd5b0ec91b4d8dd50a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',\n'0xf9c251a70000000000000000000000002592998309c9a89d9eaaf7cf7cfa94db8ba877030000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',\n'0xf9c251a7000000000000000000000000b0ad0eea2061d1b699e6c0d353fdee59f40262bb000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006517c1dfd2e9bfce0000',\n'0xf9c251a7000000000000000000000000cf0fb739fb119b4e41e872a2a1223832900f036100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000137e4cd7a1d1cd270000',\n'0x74474d28000000000000000000000000716d4e863536ac862ad34bc4ecacba07d8831bea'\n]\ncallHashTimelock '0x23a321f19d23a56e2a186b370738326477c0d9a5c6e7ecbdf1416455964e61b9'\nlastCall 15964852\nballot 0\n\n```\n\nTest Cases\n----------\n\nThe code will be dry-run using Ethereum mainnet forks. Values will be inspected to make sure that they make sense and yield the intended results.\n\nThe following should be true AFTER the proposal is executed:\n\n-   All the targeted grants have expected allocations\n-   All targeted grants with range values have updated the range as expected\n-   Allocations that are now zero are deleted from storage\n-   NO other values should change except `allocation` and `range`\n\nSecurity Considerations\n-----------------------\n\n-   There are several security considerations with this proposal. Most importantly, this proposal will make changes to existing token grants in the vesting vault and is therefore very sensitive. Extra care should be taken to make sure that updated values in the created proposal align with intentions.\n-   The other security concern is with the smart contract used to perform the modifications to the token grants. This contract should go under audit and review to ensure that it only performs the desired changes to the smart contract and that it has no unintended consequences.\n\nTechnical Review Plan or Audit Information (If already available)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe code for this proposal is publicly available for the community to review at <https://github.com/sentilesdal/council>. Engineers at Element Finance, Inc have conducted internal reviews of both the smart contract updates and the code used to generate the proposal. After the proposal is made public, there should be ample time to allow the community to audit the code.\n\nNext Steps (Voting Outcome Summary)\n-----------------------------------\n\n1.  This proposal is currently a `Draft`.\n    1.  We welcome all questions and comments over the next week, but please be advised that Element Team Members will not be able to provide comments beyond formatting and technical commentary.\n2.  Once the feedback has been addressed, this will move to be officially `Proposed`.\n3.  Once Proposed, there will be a 1 week review period before it moves to the next stage, Off-Chain Poll (Snapshot).\n4.  On Snapshot, the governance community will vote for:\n    1.  Yes: You agree that the token grants for departed team members should be removed/reclaimed.\n    2.  No: You disagree that the token grants for departed team members should be removed/reclaimed.\n    3.  Abstain: formally decline to vote either YES or NO.\n5.  If this proposal passes the Off-Chain Poll, it will proceed to the On-chain Vote, where the vote options will remain the same as on Snapshot.\n6.  If this proposal passes, the proposal will officially be Accepted and the code will proceed to the Execution stage where the previously allocated token grants will be removed/reclaimed.",

      "content": "EGP#: 23  \nTitle: Convert timestamps to blocknumbers in Deployed Vesting Vault  \nAuthor(s):  Type: Protocol Proposal  \nStatus: Proposed\nDate Proposed: <yyyy-mm-dd> \nDate Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>\n\nReferences\n\n-   [Vesting Vault Documentation](https://docs.element.fi/governance-council/council-protocol-smart-contracts/voting-vaults/vesting-vault)\n-   [Vesting Vault Contract](https://github.com/element-fi/council/blob/main/contracts/vaults/VestingVault.sol)\n-   [Deployed Vesting Vault Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x716D4e863536aC862AD34bC4eCaCBa07d8831bEA#readContract)\n\nSentence Summary\n\nThis EGP is being proposed to fix an identified bug within the deployed Vesting Vault Contract regarding the token grant configurations for core contributors, advisors, and investors. The underlying smart contract is working as expected.\n\nParagraph Summary\n\nIt was identified that the grants in the Vesting vault contract were misconfigured during deployment last March 31, 2022. The time in which the grants will start vesting was set up using Unix time stamps in seconds instead of block numbers. The contract expects block numbers as the threshold when funds will start dispersing. The difference between block numbers and time stamps is on an order of magnitude. This has caused all grants to not start until the year ~2630.\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to rectify this issue by upgrading the smart contract to check for block numbers instead of timestamps.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe purpose of this EGP is to implement a solution to resolve the identified bug in the Vesting vault smart contract and ensure that the previously allocated token grants are disbursed as originally intended.\n\nImportant note: Neither Element Finance, Inc. nor Element Finance Team members will vote on this proposal. Furthermore, Element engineers will provide purely technical comments only; they will not provide any statements on the wisdom or appropriateness of the proposal.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe VestingVault has an error that prevents an internal method, `_getWithdrawableAmount()`, from properly calculating how much of a grant is withdrawable. Essentially, the method verifies several things to calculate how much of a grant is withdrawable:\n\n1.  the grant is past its creation date.\n2.  the grant is past its cliff date.\n3.  the grant is past its maturation date.\n\nIf 1 or 2 are not true, then none of the grant is withdrawable. If 3 *is* true, then the full amount is withdrawable. If none are true, an amount is withdrawable according to a linear vesting schedule.\n\nThe error is in the checks for 1,2,3 in that the method is expecting to compare block number values. However, the grants were created with timestamp values in seconds.\n\nFor example, grants were initially created with a cliff at timestamp 1680307199, (January 18th, 2023). As of 1/17/2023, block numbers are about 16436456. If we perform a check to see if the grant has reached its cliff yet we get the following comparison:\n\n// determine if a grant has past it's cliff  block.number < grant.cliff  // 16,436,456 < 1,680,307,199\n\nUsing this formula, at the current 12/block rate, the affected grants would not reach their respective cliffs for more than 600 years.\n\nThere are two ways to solve this issue:\n\n-   Update the grant values to use block numbers instead of timestamps\n-   Update the proxy implementation of the vesting vault\n\nThe former is less intrusive, requires no code change, and is therefore more secure.\n\nProposed Code\n\nAs a part of this proposal, a smart contract will be used to perform the necessary modifications to existing grants. This contract can be viewed here: <https://github.com/sentilesdal/council/contracts/vaults/UnfrozenVestingVault.sol>\n\nOnly the method that will be called is `updateTimeStampsToBlocks()`.\n\nThe scripts in the above-mentioned repository will be used to deploy the upgraded smart contract, and create and execute the proposal.\n\nThe basic idea of the proposal is that, from the `Timelock` contract, the following three actions will be performed on the VestingVault:\n\n1.  Upgrade the proxy implementation of the VestingVault.\n2.  Update `cliff`, `expiration`, `created` values from timestamps to blocks on all grants.\n3.  Reset the proxy implementation of the VestingVault.\n\nYou can see the proposed values below for the creation of the proposal, assuming that the proposer uses only the locking vault to satisfy the minimum voting power threshold to create the proposal.\n\nproposalId 4  votingVaults [ '0x02Bd4A3b1b95b01F2Aa61655415A5d3EAAcaafdD' ]  extraVaultData [ '0x00' ]  targets [

Values will be inspected to make sure that they make sense and yield the intended results.\n\nThe following should be true BEFORE the proposal is executed:\n\n-   All the targeted grants have the same start, cliff and expiration times.\n-   All targeted grants have a start and cliff timestamp of `1680307199s`, 31 Mar 2023 23:59:59 GMT.\n-   All targeted grants have an expiration timestamp of `1743465599s`, 31 Mar 2025 23:59:59 GMT.\n\nThe following should be true AFTER the proposal is executed:\n\n-   All the targeted grants have the same start, cliff, and expiration times.\n-   All targeted grants have a start and cliff block number of `16952534` +/- 1 block.\n-   This is approximately Fri, 31 Mar 2023 23:59:59 GMT at 12.07s/block.\n-   All targeted grants have an expiration block number of `22185210` +/- 1 block.\n-   This is approximately Mon, 31 Mar 2025 23:59:59 GMT at 12.07s/block.\n-   NO other values should change.\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\n-   There are several security considerations with this proposal. Most importantly, this proposal will make changes to existing token grants and is therefore very sensitive. Extra care should be taken to make sure that updated values in the created proposal align with intentions.\n-   The other security concern is with the contract used to perform the modifications to the grant. This contract should go under audit and review to ensure that it only performs the desired changes to the contract and has no unintended consequences.\n\nTechnical Review Plan or Audit Information (If already available)\n\nThe code for this proposal is publicly available for the community to review at <https://github.com/sentilesdal/council>. Engineers at Element Finance have conducted internal reviews of both the smart contract updates and the code used to generate the proposal. After the proposal is made public, there should be ample time to allow the community to audit the code.\n\nNext Steps (Voting Outcome Summary)\n\n1.  This proposal is currently a `Draft`.\n2.  We welcome all questions and comments over the next week, but please be advised that Element Team Members will not be able to provide comments beyond formatting and technical commentary.\n3.  Once the feedback has been addressed, this will move to be officially Proposed.\n4.  Once Proposed, there will be a 1 week review period before it moves to the next stage, Off-Chain Poll (Snapshot).\n5.  On Snapshot, the governance community will vote for:\n6.  Yes: You agree that the vesting vault bug fix should be implemented.\n7.  No: You disagree that the vesting vault bug fix should be implemented.\n8.  Abstain: formally decline to vote either YES or NO.\n9.  If this proposal passes the Off-Chain Poll, it will proceed to the On-chain Vote, where the vote options will remain the same as on Snapshot.\n10. If this proposal passes, the proposal will officially be Accepted and the code will proceed to the Execution stage where the vesting vault bug fix will be implemented.",

      "title": "EGP-21: Enable the transferability of ELFI",
      "content": "Author: MacNBTC (https://twitter.com/MacnBTC)\nType: Protocol Proposal\nStatus: Snapshot (Off-chain vote)\nDate Proposed: <2022-01-23>\nDate Ratified: TBD\n\nSentence Summary\n----------------\n\nEnable the transferability of ELFI by unlocking the voting vaults where the delegated ELFI tokens are currently locked in. \n\nParagraph Summary\n-----------------\n\nThis EGP is focused on enabling the transferability of ELFI to allow for the changing of hands of voters. It has been close to 1 year since the release of ELFI, and sufficient (necessary) progress has been made in the development of the DAO. Now is the time for all of the participants within the DAO and the users outside of the DAO looking in to be given the ability to freely choose how they want to express their form of participation.\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nI was one of the earliest supporters of the protocol, and I was avidly supportive of keeping ELFI untransferrable until decent progress has been made. I believe that time is now. The DAO is currently at a standstill in terms of participation. Progress on all fronts are still being made, but the numbers do not grow.\n\nCurrently 7.8 million votes are delegated, but only roughly 1.1 million of those votes are participating actively on any given proposal. Maybe some are due to the category of those proposals not pertaining to the voting participant, but a 14% average voting turnout highlights the bigger issue that major voting apathy exists and the votes are delegated to the wrong hands. \n\nTransferability fixes this, because users who are indifferent can simply leave and it brings an opportunity for other users who want to participate in the DAO and take ownership of the network to freely exercise their right to do so. As it currently stands, no new DAO participants can take ownership and reap the benefits of contributing to the DAO. Although they’re encouraged to freely come in and do the work, there is no real motivation to do so as they simply feel that the growth of the network and the DAO will not benefit them and they’re essentially just doing work for someone else. \n\nAs sufficient time has passed, it’s important that we begin the process of enabling transferability as soon as possible. At the 1 year mark of ELFI, the team and investors will begin vesting ownership of the network further thus making Element even more centralized. If users who currently have no ownership of the Element protocol but wish to do so simply do not have that ability whilst the team and investors ownership continue to grow, then the aspect of transferability would have done the opposite of what it was intended to do at the start. \n\nSpecification\n-------------\n\nThe proposed technical solution is an upgrade to the LockingVault contract to allow all staked and delegated ELFI to be withdrawn and transferable, I defer to John or someone on the team if there is a simpler solution. \n\nProposed Code\n-------------\n\nCurrently under development by John (pickleback) - will be ready prior to an on-chain vote if passed. This is a simple implementation. \n\nTest Cases\n----------\n\nN/A\n\nSecurity Considerations\n-----------------------\n\nN/A\n\nTechnical Review Plan or Audit Information\n------------------------------------------\n\nTechnical review will be done by Greg or any relevant parties.\n\nNext Steps (Voting Outcome Summary)\n-----------------------------------\n\nOption A [YES]: Implement EGP-21 to enable the transferability of ELFI.\n\nOption B [NO]: The EGP-21 implementation will be rejected and will not be implemented.\n\nOption C [ABSTAIN]\n\nFurther Information & Comments:\n-----------------------------------\n",

The APY for all the existing pools supported by Element Finance is sourced from pools including volatile crypto assets or USD-pegged stablecoins.\n\nOn the flip side, Angle Protocol has launched several Euro stables pools including the biggest Euro stables pool on Ethereum mainnet: the agEUR-EUROC pool on Curve Finance.\n\nOnboarding this pool on Element Finance would provide a resilient and fixed yield source for Euro users while protecting them against change risks.\n\nThe pool is consistently used by swappers on Curve and supported by Angle Protocol through its veCRV voting power.\n\nCreating a fixed-yield market on top of yvCurve-agEUR-EUROC-f will be appreciated by Euro native yield seekers and long-term depositors seeking yield from their Euro holdings.\n\nMore generally, the benefits would be:\n\n-   Diversified yield source\n-   Euro-stablecoin holders attraction\n-   Consistently strong APY supported by voting power\n-   Long-term depositors attraction\n-   Trustless and battle-tested contract from Curve\n\nThis proposed integration could be a first step to future integrations of agEUR pools on Element Finance.\n\nSpecification\n-------------\n\n*Asset Classification*\n\n*1.Name of the proposed asset.*\n\nYearn vault for Curve agEUR-EUROC Factory (yvCurve-agEUR-EUROC-f)\n\n*2.Strategy or single yield source.*\n\n*a. Underlying asset classification*\n\nInterest-bearing stablecoin deposit\n\n*b. List of all underlying assets*\n\nagEUR and EUROC.\n\nAs of today, the basket breakdown (Liquidity + %) is the following:\n\n-   agEUR 6.8m 73.57%\n-   EUROC 2.4m 26.42%\n\n*c. What mechanisms does it use to maintain stability?*\n\nagEUR is an ERC20 token backed by reserves composed of USDC, DAI, FRAX, LUSD, WETH, and WBTC on the Ethereum mainnet. It can be minted and burnt at a 1:1 rate from USDC, DAI and FRAX.\n\nThe protocol hedges itself against the EUR/USD change risk by issuing perpetual futures, and through agents called Standards Liquidity Providers, which deposit collateral in the protocol. agEUR can also be borrowed (similar to Dai) in an over-collateralized way through a borrowing module available.\n\nEUROC is a centralized Euro-pegged stablecoin issued by Circle that can be bought at a 1:1 rate with fiat Euro currency. Its peg is hence supported by the reserves held by its issuer.\n\nBoth [agEUR](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ageur) and [EUROC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/euro-coin) have consistently maintained a tight peg.\n\nThe abovementioned conservative designs of both agEUR and EUROC limit exposure to market turmoil and provide strong protections against depeg risks\n\n*d. If it's not a stablecoin, what drives the underlying asset(s) price?*\n\nN/A\n\n*3.Yield source(s) according to each underlying asset.*\n\n*a.Organic (e.g. lending, borrowing, underwriting risk).*Trading fees from the agEUR-EUROC pool\n\n1.  Boosted Curve gauge rewards\n2.  Convex rewards\n\n*b.Emissions.*\n\n1.  Sell and reinvest agEUR\n2.  Sell and reinvest EUROC\n\n*c.Inflation.*\n\n1.  N/A\n\n*4\\. Enumerated underlying asset(s) liquidity.*\n\n1.  agEUR: [agEUR analytics](https://analytics.angle.money/#/agEUR)\n2.  EUROC: [Redeemable reserves overview](https://www.circle.com/en/euro-coin)\n\n*5\\. Can the asset(s) protocol economics be modified?*\n\n*a. What economic protocol parameters can be modified?*\n\n1.  Yearn Finance Take rate\n2.  Similar to other Curve pools, the parameters affecting the pool that can be modified are fees and the amplification parameter following a full Curve DAO vote. Rewards can also be modified.\n\n*b. What are the requirements to change protocol parameters?*\n\n1.  A Yearn Finance governance vote or a Curve DAO vote.\n\n*6\\. Asset strategy fixed or flexible.*\n\n*a. If flexible, who/what is able to modify the strategy?*\n\n1.  Concerning Yearn Finance: N/A\n2.  The Curve Finance governance can propose changes affecting contracts, fees level, and potentially new Euro pools can emerge. However, Curve Finance and its rewards system have demonstrated longevity and stability at the scale of the Defi ecosystem.\n\nIn addition, the agEUR-EUROC people involve two of the most trusted and most used Euro stablecoins. Both offer a transparent approach to their collateral reserves and functioning ([EUROC website](https://www.circle.com/en/euro-coin), [agEUR analytics](https://analytics.angle.money/#/home)).\n\n*b. List all modification requirements and scenarios.*\n\n1.  Concerning Yearn: a modified strategy would require a new vault deployment and users migrating funds\n2.  Stablecoins yield may change due to the above-mentioned reasons.\n\nProposed Term Duration\n----------------------\n\nThe proposed term duration for this new asset would be six months starting from late January, implying an end date around July 31, 2023.\n\nProposed Code\n-------------\n\nThe Element Core Team has previously onboarded Yearn vaults as eligible assets. We would look to follow the same process previously conducted.\n\nTest Cases\n----------\n\nN/A\n\nSecurity Considerations\n-----------------------\n\nFor more information on risks associated with Yearn Finance: please visit this [page](https://docs.yearn.finance/resources/risks/risk-score).\n\nFor more information on risks associated with Curve Finance: please visit this [page](https://resources.curve.fi/faq/security).\n\nFor more information on the terms of Angle Protocol: please visit this [page](https://app.angle.money/#/terms).\n\nFor more information on the terms of Circle's EUROC: please visit this [page](https://www.circle.com/en/legal/euro-coin-terms).\n\n*1\\. List of all directly related protocols to the classified assets above*\n\n-   Angle protocol\n    -   Circle\n    -   Curve Finance\n    -   Yearn Finance\n\n*2\\. All relevant audit information including a report (if public)*\n\nIf not public it needs to be acknowledged.\n\n-   [Yearn audits](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/tree/master/audits)\n-   [Curve audits](https://curve.fi/audits)\n-   [Angle Protocol Audits](https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits)\n-   [EUROC public accountants' attestations](https://www.circle.com/en/euro-coin)\n\n*3\\. List any past vulnerabilities or exploits (including stolen funds).*\n\nOnly Yearn Finance has previously had an [exploit](https://halborn.com/explained-the-yearn-v1-ydai-hack-feb-2021/) and this issue has since been resolved.\n\n*4\\. List any exploits or discovered vulnerabilities by white hat or bounty programs*\n\nNone\n\nTechnical Review Plan or Audit Information\n------------------------------------------\n\nSee above\n\nNext Steps (Voting Outcome Summary)\n-----------------------------------\n\n-   Discuss this proposal on the Element Finance forum\n-   Implement a poll on this proposal on Snapshot\n-   Onboarding and deployment of the Element Finance pool for yvCurve-agEUR-EUROC-f with an initial maturity date set at July 31, 2023\n",

      "title": "EGP-19: Karma proposal - Analytics suite for DAO governance contributions [Grant Proposal]",
      "content": "References: \n\n<https://optimism.showkarma.xyz/>\n[Github](https://github.com/show-karma/dao-delegates-app)\n[https://www.showkarma.xyz](https://www.showkarma.xyz/)\n\nSentence Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to implement an Analytics suite for DAO governance contributions, providing Element Finance with tools to take data-driven actions that increase engagement, accountability and, ultimately, foster DAO governance automation. \n\nParagraph Summary\n\nKarma aggregates and analyzes governance contributions such as voting (on-chain and off-chain), delegation, Discord / Forum discussions and any other sources the DAO uses for governance. Aggregated data is then transformed into actionable insights displayed via a custom dashboard. This provides visibility into delegation activity, helps token holders make delegation decisions and allows delegates to monitor their own activity.\n\nKarma also has the functionality to generate contribution scores that can be used for a number of governance actions, such as building custom voting vaults to assign additional voting power, assigning access & permission, distributing rewards (governance mining) and assisting with compensation (see <https://forum.element.fi/discussion/7316-egp-phase-1-gsc-compensation>).\n\nThe following sequential work packages outline the project scope: \n\n1) Indexing Contributions \n\nKarma will index Element Finance sources relevant to DAO governance contributions. These include (but are not limited to): \n\n-   Delegation stats\n-   Snapshot voting stats\n-   On-chain voting stats\n-   Forum activity (proposals initiated, discussed, posts discussed, likes received etc.)\n-   Discord activity\n\n2) Scoring Contribution (Optional)\n\nFor a simplified review of governance activity and possible follow-up actions, Karma will aggregate Element's different contribution data and optionally calculate respective scores. However, since governance contributions vary from DAO to DAO and have different significance in them, the scoring will be customized in close coordination with the DAO. \n\nYou can find the scoring model Gitcoin uses here <https://github.com/show-karma/reputation-scores/blob/main/src/score/gitcoin-health-score.provider.ts>\n\nNote: the scoring logic is open source, so the Element Finance can audit and verify the scores themselves. The aggregated data is exposed through APIs and can be freely integrated with other applications as needed.\n\n3) Actionable Insights via Contribution Dashboard\n\nA governance dashboard (hosted on Element Finance's subdomain) can be set up to display contributor stats. Features include:\n\n-   Display high-level voting stats\n-   Display voting history from Snapshot/on-chain\n-   Display delegate commitment message\n-   Display delegate voting reason for each proposal\n-   Optional display of Contribution Scores to summarize all activity, incl. proposing, commenting etc.\n-   Token Delegation right from the dashboard\n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/26CfYYeJrdYZHVCZSkt4W4Ffd3lpWNhAFKttdwNE7f5fH1DdMBaCVx42b2G0hP-6mNxf7jdouFheO6z_9RzM9s-YsyYgN5EjgzZSWWrbqNNe78fR1NRrrijICKJKEAhqrE7ANhRwnxrzF-1uJENQO4mSAuiKkD0AoORZlX9s_afTROsGdOLgJvM8lQCSyQ)\n\n<https://optimism.showkarma.xyz/>\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/qOhcd7TRXPXdTuVxmbZwnBu83V65kN52siwe-UURIdujYK3jbHA-znlCmCSKofUcygmjvzAcleVmCDS89zqXTf0zOwpiCZf3ojOTxAVAMltaPiktn4O4V5LhqxTr69SEV1-oTHM_s5sN5b9oIAnmusEu0dnT57otRvzbOCb58TsLX0D_OsFUdtxOHD8_Qw)\n\n<https://optimism.showkarma.xyz/profile/0x406b607644c5d7bfda95963201e45a4c6ab1c159#statement>\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/dcXejxLxD5b2Gwn4zuHrNjUSXtGbGDWo8179cquPFNWtHoeid0DDUMVJzr88Q-HuWii3-CruS5Fg97QqovB6JCN4_80gXqkZ9eMKK2MDczRgZpbx3WVFeiF27y-vlvMcORGqEhLQUo8x-miEfRBw64bNyI-zoYv5zaYhMuvK1csXfBwvl4W_uM8AFqzlTw)\n\n<https://optimism.showkarma.xyz/profile/0x406b607644c5d7bfda95963201e45a4c6ab1c159#votinghistory>\n\n4) Governance Action & Automation via Credentialing\n\nBased on the contribution scoring, governance credentials can be minted as non-transferable NFT badges (SBTs). Here, it has proven useful to define threshold values and assign corresponding memberships (e.g., GSC). Triggered actions can be, for example, the allocation of rewards and compensation. \n\nNote: Karma is fully composable and believes in the power of DAO Governance Legos. Further permissioning based on scores (such as token-gating communication channels) could be added in collaboration with players such as Guild.xyz, Hats protocol or others. \n\nMotivation\n\nThe Governance Steering Council (GSC) has been set up as a key governance body through which the community governs the DAO's decentralization. GSC - a group of elected representatives and equipped with delegated voting power - mitigates the need for individual voters to actively participate in governance and thus reduces the risk of voting fatigue.\n\nHowever, delegation often comes at the expense of transparency and accountability. The monitoring of a delegatee's performance takes time and cognitive effort. Further, existing tools and information sources are not geared towards DAO-specific delegation requirements. \n\nKarma fills the gap and provides Element Finance with a modular, expandable solution for governance (contribution) analytics. The resulting visibility layer enables informed governance actions & automation. \n\nPrevious Work\n\nThe Karma team is experienced in building high-quality, scalable software systems and has deep expertise in DAO governance. Mahesh Murthy - the founder of Karma and responsible for Technology, Product & Operations - has built complex software systems from the ground up. Kathleen Olstedt, Business Generalist & Governance Strategist has advised Web3 organizations with Bankless Consulting and was part of Idle Finance's Treasury League.\n\nA few notable implementations are:\n\n-   Optimism: Karma has been commissioned to revamp the [Optimism Delegation Dashboard](https://optimism.showkarma.xyz/), and add new visibility features in an iterative process. \n-   Gitcoin's [steward health cards](http://daostewards.xyz/) are powered by Karma. All the stats are calculated by Karma and exposed through API that is rendered by their frontend.\n-   ENS DAO uses Karma's[ discourse forum plugin](https://discuss.ens.domains/u/nick.eth/summary) to display governance stats of DAO participants inside their forum profile. \n-   Idle Finance uses Karma for [governance mining](https://mirror.xyz/showkarma.eth/pNgfDI_7u3YSWxOCO9vCQFmyzkkndt15d-K267S890A) to reward active governance participants.\n\nGrant Size & Distribution\n\nThis project is solely to improve the governance of Element Finance by providing more visibility into Governance Contributions. We are requesting a grant of $15k in ELFI to support the development and maintenance of this project and do not plan to distribute the tokens. \n\nWe are aware that ELFI is currently illiquid, so we are willing to wait till the token unlock event occurs at which time we can be awarded an equivalent amount of ELFI based on the market price of token. We will wait until the ELFI price is stable.\n\nMilestones\n\n1\\. Set up a dashboard with delegation function, snapshot and forum integrations and any additional sources which may be defined in interaction with the community. ($7.5k)\n\n2\\. Define and set up Scoring based on feedback from the community ($3.75k)\n\n3\\. Set up Minting for Governance (Contribution) Credentials as non-transferable NFTs ($3.75k)\n\nAccountability\n\nJust as Karma brings accountability to DAO governance, we also place the highest demands on ourselves. \n\nAs the implementation is done on behalf of the DAO participants, accordingly we will transparently report each milestone here in the forum and address open questions. You can find our accountability thread on Optimism [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/karma-grantee-accountability-feedback-thread/3960).\n\nAfter completion of the project, we will conduct a survey to assess the quality and possible suggestions for improvement. In addition, we will be available as consultants for future additions and extensions. \n\nNext Steps\n\n1\\. Discuss concerns or questions regarding the Analytics Suite\n2\\. Conduct a snapshot poll to approve the implementation\n3\\. Mile-stone-based Implementation",

      "content": "EGP-18\nTitle: Introduce Push Protocol Notifications for ElementFi Governance.\nAuthor: Jaf | Push Protocol Core Team\nType: Social proposal\nStatus: Proposed\nDate Proposed: October 31st, 2022\nDate Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>\n\n## References\nPush Protocol Website (https://push.org/)\nPush Protocol Docs (https://docs.push.org/hub/)\nPush Protocol Governance Forum (https://gov.push.org/)\n\n## Sentence Summary\nIntroduce Push Protocol Notifications to provide a direct engagement channel to increase participation in Governance.\n\n## Paragraph Summary\nWe propose **Push Protocol Notifications** to be integrated with Element Finance’s Governance front. Decentralized notifications through Push Protocol establish a direct line of communication between Element Finance and users. Users will have the ability to receive notifications and take action right away. These notifications will inform users about new proposals up for voting, when voting periods are closing, and voting results.\n\n## Motivation\nMaking the best use of technologies at hand to enhance user experience is the essence of innovation in Web3. Many protocols and dApps currently rely on emails or social media tools like Twitter, Telegram, and Discord to communicate with their users.\n\nBy implementing Push decentralized notifications, a direct channel is created between Element Finance and users. Users will be able to receive notifications containing a summary of proposals up for voting and respond immediately to them.\n\nAll notifications can be delivered in rich media format with links and images, resulting in a more engaging user experience. Here are some of the use cases for which users of Element Finance will start receiving notifications:\n\n- New Proposal made it to the voting phase\n- 24 hour notice to cast your vote\n- Voting results\n\nIt can also work for ad-hoc announcements, new feature launches, maintenance windows announcements, and many more updates.\n\nSending out notifications for Governance proposals will greatly help towards increasing participation in the Governance process, and making sure project stakeholders are informed at all times regarding decisions taken via Governance.\n\n## Specification / Proposal Details\n1) Push team will take care of all integration & implementation activities with their team. Ensuring notifications are configured properly to cover the use cases described above.\n\n2) Element Finance will create a Channel in Push Protocol to which users can opt-in to start receiving notifications.\n\n3) Push team will assist as needed in adding the “Opt-in” functionality in Element.fi front-end to facilitate users subscribing to the channel to receive governance notifications.\n\n## Next steps (Voting Outcome Summary)\n**Option A [YES]:** Implement Push Protocol Notifications to send notifications regarding Governance Updates to all subscribers \n\n**Option B [NO]:** The implementation will be rejected and will not be implemented.\n\n## Further Information & Comments:",

Still, to make it more digestible, we believe stepping stones are an excellent way to transition the GSC into a more active role within the DAO.\n\nWith some form of incentives, we can expect more participation and transparency from the GSC. In the long term, making the transition to a more active role within the DAO more seamless, rather than a zero-to-hundred.\n\n## Specification / Proposal Details\n\n**Compensate GSC members with 100 ELFI per month if they complete the following:**\n\n1.) Participate in at least 75% of off-chain and on-chain votes per month.\na.) future proposal will be put forth to compensate on-chain vote gas costs for GSC members.\n\n2.) Communicate reasoning for at least 75% of monthly votes in a delegate thread. (Example: https://forum.element.fi/discussion/4616-stablenode-delegate-platform)\n\n3.) Participate in at least 50% of community calls\n\n**Reduced Participation - GSC Members will receive 50 ELFI if they complete the following:**\n\n1.) Participate in at least 50% of off-chain and on-chain votes per month.\na.) future proposal will be put forth to compensate on-chain vote gas costs for GSC members.\n\n2.) Communicate reasoning for at least 50% of monthly votes in a delegate thread. \n\n3.) Participate in at least 50% of community calls\n\n**Operations will keep a public record of all GSC members' activity. This will also help us review the success of this program and whether it should continue.**\n\n**We expect to have this in play for an indefinite period till amendments or other phases are made to increase the GSC’s role and responsibility. Community members can also present a proposal to pause this program.**\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**Option A [YES]:** Operations will keep a public record of all GSC members who complete the requirements. Those GSC members will be compensated with x amount of ELFI once the token becomes liquid.\n\n**Option B [NO]:** Eligible GSC members will not receive compensation for their participation.\n\n## Further Information & Comments:",

In addition to the DAO wallet the GSC wallet currently has around 45k worth of derivative assets, split across Element LP positions and Balancer LP positions. In order to clean up DAO operations these assets need to be unwound, and then consolidated into the DAO treasury.\n\nMotivation\n\nGiven the ongoing bootstrapping of the Element DAO, now is a good time to sort out the DAO treasury at a base level. While the DAO may have some amount of non-ELFI assets to work with, none of them are in base assets such as DAI, ETH, or USDC. In order for the DAO to use any of these assets to further the goals of the DAO, the derivative positions in the GSC and DAO Treasury will need to be unwound. Considering that network fees are relatively low, unwinding now seems prudent and likely more cost effective than waiting. Finally, assets split across both the DAO treasury and the GSC wallet eschews what should be the standard practice of funding the GSC wallet via the Element DAO governance process. We believe that any petty cash given to the GSC should be subject to this governance process, not granted by default. By unwinding **all** assets and then consolidating them in the DAO treasury, the DAO will be better positioned to follow transparent standards around distributions or future treasury strategies.\n\nSpecification\n\n-   For **each** wallet, unwind all the derivative assets into their base assets **e.g. USDC Principle Token / USDC LP → USDC, yvCurve-stETH → ETH**\n-   Consolidate all stablecoins to USDC. This includes DAI, LUSD, MIM, alUSD, EURS, USDT, etc.\n-   Convert any wBTC to USDC\n-   Convert any stETH to ETH\n-   Transfer all converted ETH and USDC post unwind in the GSC wallet to the DAO treasury. This would leave the DAO treasury with all of the unwound assets, in either USDC or ETH.\n\nProposed Code\n\n**Not Applicable. There should be no code changes needed for this proposal.**\n\nTest Cases\n\n**Not Applicable. There should be no code changes needed for this proposal.**\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\nSecurity considerations for this proposal center mostly around smart contract interactions with third party contracts such as Yearn, Balancer, and UniSwap. While the risk is not zero, these applications and contracts are battle tested and fully audited. As such we believe there is minimal risk or security considerations to the DAO. Furthermore, this risk is unavoidable due to the fact that any utilization of these assets would require the aforementioned contract interactions at some point.\n\nTechnical Review Plan or Audit Information (If already available)\n\n**Not Applicable. There should be no code changes needed for this proposal.**\n\nNext Steps (Voting Outcome Summary)\n\nThis is a relatively low impact change that merely converts derivative assets to their underlying, for the purposes of creating a more fungible treasury with reduced risk exposure. Being that this is a preliminary proposal for future treasury management efforts, that does not express preference, we expect it to be non contentious. For these reasons we believe we can follow a relatively quick proposal to execution timeline as follows:\n\n1.  Discuss this proposal on the forum and discord (Week of October 3rd)\n2.  Implement a poll on this proposal on Snapshot: Tentatively shooting for this Thursday assuming there are no contrarian opinions or comments that need to be addressed or discussed further\n3.  Coordinate with current DAO and GSC wallet operators to execute the change: As soon as the proposal passes snapshot (assuming it does)",

      "content": "EGP-15\nTitle: Element Fixed Borrow Protocol Grant Proposal (By Component)\nAuthor(s): @Christian St.Louis @Rahul\nType: Grant Proposal\nDate Proposed: <2022-08-03>\nDate Edited: <2022-09-10>\n\n## References\nYield Token Compounding & github\nComponent.fi\n\n## Sentence Summary\nComponent is proposing a 274,414.06 ELFI voting token grant to build a fixed borrow protocol on top of Element Finance and for building the YTC tool.\n\n## Why 274,414.06 ELFI?\nThe token technically has no monetary value at the moment and so it's difficult to give a reason from an up to date monetary standpoint. The monetary value we took into consideration is based on the most recent public valuation from Element's Series A fundraise. Second to this, the distribution of this ELFI is a step towards becoming more involved in governance and the governance steering council. We believe that given Component's previous work and the amount of time and work that is going into this protocol, that we should have the ability to have significant involvement in governance as a result of our contribution. This is possible either through delegation or direct involvement.\n\n## Paragraph Summary\nThe proceeds of this grant will enable us to build a protocol offering competitive, low-cost, fixed-rate borrowing on Compound Finance and Aave. Component has been an active contributor to Element Finance since early 2021 and will continue to launch new integrations for fixed rates on Element Finance. This grant ensures a long term relationship where Component will be part of growing, generating revenue and decentralizing the Element DAO.\n\n## Grant Size & Milestones\n\nWe are proposing a total grant amount of 274,414.06 ELFI tokens, representing approximately 0.669% of the fully-diluted Element DAO Treasury. Listed below are the proposed milestones.\n\nYTC Retro - Retroactive grant distribution for the Yield Token Compounding tool\n\n*Grant size: 19,531.25 ELFI*\nGrant to be released: Full grant size released upon onchain approval of the proposal\nv1.0 - Existing borrowers on Compound & AAVE are able to convert their variable borrow rates to fixed rates\n\n*Grant size: 109,450.12 ELFI*\nGrant to be released: 54,725.06 ELFI upon onchain approval of the proposal and 54,725.06 ELFI upon completion\nv2.1 & v2.2 - v1.0 repurposed and built on Element v2 and the Full Fixed Borrow protocol where you can be a new borrower (on Element v2)\n\n*Grant size: 145,432.69 ELFI*\nGrant to be released: 72,716.345 ELFI onset of v2.1 & v2.2 product development and 72,716.345 ELFI upon release of both v2.1 and v2.2\n\nKey Note We will only move forward with v2.1 and v2.2 (which are both to be built on Element V2) depending on the success and uptake of v1.0 (built on Element V1).\n\n## Further Information\n\nThis is a shortened version, you can find more information in the discussion link below.",

[Yearn Strategy](https://yearn.finance/#/vault/0x4213458C69c19E6792510E1153cb0c5834665fdC)\n2.  [Balancer Boosted Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0xa13a9247ea42d743238089903570127dda72fe4400000000000000000000035d)\n3.  [Aura Finance](https://aura.finance/)\n\nSentence Summary\n----------------\n\nThis proposal calls for the addition of a Yearn Finance strategy that auto-compounds deposits of the bb-a-USD Balancer Finance pool via Aura Finance as a supported yield originator.\n\nParagraph Summary\n-----------------\n\nBalancer Finance allows for the rehypothecation of liquidity provider assets into yield-bearing strategies via its Asset Manager functionality. Its flagship proof of concept is the Aave-boosted pool, which deploys USDC, DAI, and USDT into Aave in accordance with its trading volumes. This allows for higher yields and reduces the opportunity cost present in underutilized stableswap pools. \n\nIn parallel to this development, not only has Balancer Finance implemented its veBAL system, but Aura Finance has also committed to subsidizing governance-favored Balancer pools. This means that bb-a-USD LPs can receive i) trading fees, ii) rehypothecation yields, iii) $BAL emissions, and iv) $AURA emissions. Accordingly, Yearn Finance has developed a strategy capable of a) depositing bb-a-USD Balancer Pool Tokens into Aura Finance, and b) auto-compounding the position as it earns $BAL and $AURA. \n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nbb-a-USD represents the second largest pool on Balancer Finance with $140M in TVL (between two pools) at the time of writing. It typically deploys between 80 and 85% of its liquidity into AAVE, implying a blended 0.71% yield with current lending rates. Factoring in both $BAL and $AURA emissions, this comes out to ~6.5% APR prior to any auto-compounding executed by Yearn Finance. As an originator, it presents a compelling combination of organic yield as well as consistent governance token emissions. \n\nFurthermore, we at FIAT DAO see a clear win-win-win opportunity for ourselves, Element Finance, and Balancer Finance should bb-a-USD come to be supported. We would look to add support for principal tokens as collateral for minting $FIAT, which has liquidity primarily on Balancer Finance via our \"[FUD](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x178e029173417b1f9c8bc16dcec6f697bc32374600000000000000000000025d)\" pool. Users would be able to leverage their exposure to the bb-a-USD pool, resulting in locked TVL for both Balancer and Aura. If that strategy proves popular, we believe Balancer and Aura governance would have an incentive to subsidize $FIAT liquidity in order to increase the strategy's capacity. \n\nThe end state of such a scenario playing out would be:\n\n-   Recurring TVL for Element\n-   Greater interest in secondary liquidity for $FIAT\n-   Locked TVL for Balancer, Aura\n\nSpecification\n-------------\n\nAsset Classification\n\n1.

We would look to follow the same process previously conducted.\n\nTest Cases\n\nN/A\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\nThe proposed asset interfaces with the following protocols:\n\n-   Yearn Finance\n    -   [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/tree/master/audits/20210719_ToB_yearn_vaultsv2)\n-   Balancer Finance\n    -   [Trail of Bits](https://docs.balancer.fi/security/audits)\n    -   [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.balancer.fi/security/audits)\n    -   [Certora](https://docs.balancer.fi/security/audits)\n-   Aave\n    -   [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/07-01-2022_TrailOfBits_AaveV3.pdf)\n    -   [ABDK](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_ABDK_AaveV3.pdf)\n    -   [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/01-11-2021_OpenZeppelin_AaveV3.pdf)\n    -   [Certora](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/Certora/certora/Verification_Report.pdf)\n-   Aura Finance\n    -   [Code4rena Contest](https://2520301408-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fr4kLuYPt1EhIEVbkxHD8%2Fuploads%2FDuQMD5ULdRtqravKUwxQ%2FCode4rena-Audit-Report-AuraFinance-v1.0.pdf?alt=media&token=430daeb5-5760-4df5-bba6-636abb0f6988)\n    -   [Halborn Finance Audit](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Aura_Finance_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf)\n\nOnly Yearn Finance has previously had an [exploit](https://halborn.com/explained-the-yearn-v1-ydai-hack-feb-2021/) that lost user funds. The corresponding vulnerability has since been patched and Element Finance currently supports the updated version of the hacked asset (i.e. yvDAI). \n\nFor the purpose of the Security Pod review, it is worth noting that the bb-a-USD pool itself is underway with a migration to a patched version. More on this migration can be found [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/vulnerability-disclosure/3179/9?u=maxfiat).\n\nTechnical Review Plan\n\nThe Element DAO Security Pod will give its final opinion regarding the onboarding of the proposed Yearn Finance vault.\n\nNext Steps\n----------\n\n1.  Conduct off-chain vote via Snapshot\n    1.  \"Yes\" Vote: Proceed with Steps 2-5\n    2.  \"No\" Vote: Do not proceed with Steps 2-5\n2.  Security Pod to conduct its Due Diligence Report\n3.  Confirm finalization of both vault deployment and successful migration of bb-a-USD\n4.  Conduct on-chain vote for onboarding\n5.  Deploy Element Finance pool for yvBalancer-BoostedAaveUSD with an initial maturity date set for March 23rd, 2023",

The APY for most of them is highly reliant on the market bonanza. On the flip side, mStable Save (because of the plurality of its yield sources, especially its embedded AMM fees) is market-agnostic and produces a highly resilient yield\n\nCreating a fixed-yield market on top of Save would offer an additional layer of resiliency, highly appreciated by long-term-oriented depositors, looking to lock in capital for a duration of>1 year. We believe this user class is of value for Element and is relatively underserved at the moment.\n\nBeyond this, mStable alongside Element, are early adopters of the ERC-4626 standard drastically improving the composability of DeFi yield-bearing vaults. \n\nSave has recently been upgraded to be ERC-4626 compliant, the integration work of the vault shall be minimum.\n\nMore generally, the benefits would be:\n\n-   Consistently strong APY\n-   Long-term depositors attraction\n-   Trustless and battle-tested contract\n-   ERC-4626 compliant integration\n\nMore generally, we would love mStable Save to be part of the Element Finance ecosystem.\n\nIn the last few months, mStable has been heads down building a generalisable, composable and market-reactive multi-vault architecture powered by the ERC-4626 standard.\n\nAlso, we closely followed Element deployment on Aztec connect. mStable is very close to the Aztec team and is working on integrations on their network as well.\n\nSpecification\n-------------\n\nClassify the proposed new asset and all related underlying assets. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for risk analysis (DAO due diligence report) and for implementation to begin as well as testing. The specification for asset onboarding EGPs must include the following components:\n\nAsset Classification\n\n1.  *Name of the proposed asset.*\n\nmUSD \n\n1.  *Strategy or single yield source.*\n    1.  Underlying asset classification\n\nStablecoin\n\n1.  *List of all underlying assets*\n\nmUSD is the first meta-asset introduced by mStable. mUSD is a USD-pegged crypto asset in its own right, backed by a basket of selected USD stablecoins. The assets currently underlying mUSD include: USDC, USDT, DAI, sUSD\n\nAs of today, the basket breakdown (Liquidity + %) is the following: \n\n-   sUSD 3.62m 11.24%\n-   DAI 9.48m 29.42%\n-   USDC 9.67m 30.00%\n-   USDT 9.46m 29.34%\n\nIf the underlying asset(s) is a stablecoin.\n\n1.  *What mechanisms does it use to maintain stability?*\n\nmUSD is 1:1 backed by its underlying basket \n\nThe basket is constantly arbitraged through mUSD native AMM. Each asset within the basket has a set of max and min weights. Currently, these are set to 5% and 50%. This means that no single asset could make up more than 50% of the basket nor less than 5%. This is to limit exposure to a single underlying asset in the unlikely case of a depeg.\n\n1.  *If it's not a stablecoin, what drives the underlying asset(s) price?*\n\nN/A\n\n1.  *Yield source(s) according to each underlying asset.*\n    1.  Organic (e.g. lending, borrowing, underwriting risk).\n\nmStable deposits 98% of mUSD's underlying assets to established money markets to earn a base interest rate. This rate is then further increased by distributing mStable Swap fees and liquidating external protocol incentives.\n\nmUSD exposition breakdown is:\n\n-   40.5% to Aave\n-   59.5% to Compound\n\nIf we break down Save APY, 55% of it comes from lending interest revenues on Aave & Compound, 22.5% from our AMM swap fees & the remaining 22.5% from platform rewards liquidation. It would mean that 25% of Save's yield is independent of lending protocol and their inherent risk. Save APY is hence fully organic, market-neutral and ultra-consistent.\n\nAs of now, there is $13m deposited into Save on Mainet (Down from $45m ATH earlier this year)\n\n1.  *Emissions.*\n\nUnrelated to mUSD & Save\n\n1.  *Inflation.*\n\nUnrelated to mUSD & Save\n\n1.  *Enumerated underlying asset(s) liquidity.*\n2.  *Can the asset(s) protocol economics be modified?*\n    1.  What economic protocol parameters can be modified?\n\nEconomic protocols that can be modified are: fees, rewards liquidation destination\n\n1.  *What are the requirements to change protocol parameters?*\n\nmStable is a fully decentralized protocol. MTA holders can propose changes affecting contracts, fees level, and potentially new strategies.\n\nmStable is governed by MTA holders who have staked their tokens to participate in the community-based proposal system.\n\nAnyone can participate in the mStable governance process by joining discussions in either the discord or public forum. Ideas are then formalised and proposed to the community for on-chain signalling by MTA holders\n\n1.  Asset strategy fixed or flexible.\n    1.  *If flexible, who/what is able to modify the strategy?*\n\nMTA holders can propose changes affecting contracts, fees level, and potentially new strategies.\n\nHowever, it has been stated by the core team since the inception of the Save product that its risk level and strategy complexity will be serving a very specific risk profile and won't be changed.\n\n1.  *List all modification requirements and scenarios. *\n\nStablecoin Yield Source change\n\nProposed Term Duration\n----------------------\n\nTerm length: 2 months\n\nStart date: 01/10/2022\n\nTechnical Implementation\n------------------------\n\n-   The final code that will be used directly in the on-chain vote to execute the EGP.\n-   Refer to the [Yearn Vault AYearn Vault Asset Proxy Implementation Guide\n-   There should exists a whitelist of people who are qualified to create the implementations on-chain (i.e the proposal).\n-   Initially the whitelist will be individuals who have successfully created a proposal on-chain. Currently that list would be:\n-   Element Core Team\n-   Greg\n-   John\n-   Members who submit their own proposals (have the code written), and successfully execute on-chain, will be added to the whitelist.\n-   If a proposal requires implementation by someone else, the DAO will first enlist from the whitelist, if no one from the whitelist is able to take on that task, the DAO will put a bounty out for someone to make the proposal.\n-   This requires funds to exist that can be spent perhaps a few thousand dollars, and we can determine bounty sizes from there.\n\nTest Cases\n----------\n\nFor the implementation or testing of the technical implementation.\n\nSecurity Considerations\n-----------------------\n\nProposed Asset's Reputation and Security.\n\nmStable is a decentralized stablecoin ecosystem producing sustainable yield on USD. The protocol saw more than $6bn in transaction volume on its AMM, has been operating for 24 months without interruption or hacks and is one of the safest projects in DeFi for stablecoins.\n\nFor everything about risk, feel free to visit [this](https://docs.mstable.org/advanced/app-usage-terms-and-conditions)\n\n3\\.

[Yearn Strategy](https://yearn.finance/#/vault/0x4213458C69c19E6792510E1153cb0c5834665fdC)\n2.

[Aura Finance](https://aura.finance/)\n\nSentence Summary\n----------------\n\nThis proposal calls for the addition of a Yearn Finance strategy that auto-compounds deposits of the bb-a-USD Balancer Finance pool via Aura Finance as a supported yield originator.\n\nParagraph Summary\n-----------------\n\nBalancer Finance allows for the rehypothecation of liquidity provider assets into yield-bearing strategies via its Asset Manager functionality. Its flagship proof of concept is the Aave-boosted pool, which deploys USDC, DAI, and USDT into Aave in accordance with its trading volumes. This allows for higher yields and reduces the opportunity cost present in underutilized stableswap pools. \n\nIn parallel to this development, not only has Balancer Finance implemented its veBAL system, but Aura Finance has also committed to subsidizing governance-favored Balancer pools. This means that bb-a-USD LPs can receive i) trading fees, ii) rehypothecation yields, iii) $BAL emissions, and iv) $AURA emissions. Accordingly, Yearn Finance has developed a strategy capable of a) depositing bb-a-USD Balancer Pool Tokens into Aura Finance, and b) auto-compounding the position as it earns $BAL and $AURA. \n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nbb-a-USD represents the second largest pool on Balancer Finance with $140M in TVL (between two pools) at the time of writing. It typically deploys between 80 and 85% of its liquidity into AAVE, implying a blended 0.71% yield with current lending rates. Factoring in both $BAL and $AURA emissions, this comes out to ~6.5% APR prior to any auto-compounding executed by Yearn Finance. As an originator, it presents a compelling combination of organic yield as well as consistent governance token emissions. \n\nFurthermore, we at FIAT DAO see a clear win-win-win opportunity for ourselves, Element Finance, and Balancer Finance should bb-a-USD come to be supported. We would look to add support for principal tokens as collateral for minting $FIAT, which has liquidity primarily on Balancer Finance via our \"[FUD](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x178e029173417b1f9c8bc16dcec6f697bc32374600000000000000000000025d)\" pool. Users would be able to leverage their exposure to the bb-a-USD pool, resulting in locked TVL for both Balancer and Aura. If that strategy proves popular, we believe Balancer and Aura governance would have an incentive to subsidize $FIAT liquidity in order to increase the strategy's capacity. \n\nThe end state of such a scenario playing out would be:\n\n-   Recurring TVL for Element\n-   Greater interest in secondary liquidity for $FIAT\n-   Locked TVL for Balancer, Aura\n\nSpecification\n-------------\n\nAsset Classification\n\n1.

We would look to follow the same process previously conducted.\n\nTest Cases\n\nN/A\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\nThe proposed asset interfaces with the following protocols:\n\n-   Yearn Finance\n    -   [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-security/tree/master/audits/20210719_ToB_yearn_vaultsv2)\n-   Balancer Finance\n    -   [Trail of Bits](https://docs.balancer.fi/security/audits)\n    -   [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.balancer.fi/security/audits)\n    -   [Certora](https://docs.balancer.fi/security/audits)\n-   Aave\n    -   [Trail of Bits](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/07-01-2022_TrailOfBits_AaveV3.pdf)\n    -   [ABDK](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/27-01-2022_ABDK_AaveV3.pdf)\n    -   [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/audits/01-11-2021_OpenZeppelin_AaveV3.pdf)\n    -   [Certora](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/Certora/certora/Verification_Report.pdf)\n-   Aura Finance\n    -   [Code4rena Contest](https://2520301408-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2Fr4kLuYPt1EhIEVbkxHD8%2Fuploads%2FDuQMD5ULdRtqravKUwxQ%2FCode4rena-Audit-Report-AuraFinance-v1.0.pdf?alt=media&token=430daeb5-5760-4df5-bba6-636abb0f6988)\n    -   [Halborn Finance Audit](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Aura_Finance_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf)\n\nOnly Yearn Finance has previously had an [exploit](https://halborn.com/explained-the-yearn-v1-ydai-hack-feb-2021/) that lost user funds. The corresponding vulnerability has since been patched and Element Finance currently supports the updated version of the hacked asset (i.e. yvDAI). \n\nFor the purpose of the Security Pod review, it is worth noting that the bb-a-USD pool itself is underway with a migration to a patched version. More on this migration can be found [here](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/vulnerability-disclosure/3179/9?u=maxfiat).\n\nTechnical Review Plan\n\nThe Element DAO Security Pod will give its final opinion regarding the onboarding of the proposed Yearn Finance vault.\n\nNext Steps\n----------\n\n1.

      "content": "EGP-13\nTitle: <mStable Save <> Element Finance proposal>\nAuthor(s): [https://twitter.com/0xloth](https://twitter.com/0xloth%3E)\nType: Asset Onboarding Proposal\nDate Proposed: <2022-09-13>\nDate Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n-   [mStable Landing Page](https://mstable.org/)\n-   [mStable Analytics](https://dune.com/derc/mta-community)\n-   [mStable Docs](https://docs.mstable.org/)\n-   [mStable Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/mstablegovernance.eth)\n-   [mStable Governance Forum](https://forum.mstable.org/latest)\n-   [mStable Save Contracts](https://developers.mstable.org/contracts/imassets-save)\n-   [mStable & Risks](https://docs.mstable.org/advanced/app-usage-terms-and-conditions)\n\nSentence Summary\n----------------\n\nThis proposal is a temperature check for the addition of a mStable strategy to Element Finance built on top of the Save product\n\nParagraph Summary\n-----------------\n\nA couple of months ago, was initiated a discussion with the Element team about how mStable and Element Finance could partner to create a fixed-rate market on top of mStable Save & the mUSD asset\n\nMotivation\n----------\n\nElement Finance currently supports multiple vault strategies. The APY for most of them is highly reliant on the market bonanza. On the flip side, mStable Save (because of the plurality of its yield sources, especially its embedded AMM fees) is market-agnostic and produces a highly resilient yield\n\nCreating a fixed-yield market on top of Save would offer an additional layer of resiliency, highly appreciated by long-term-oriented depositors, looking to lock in capital for a duration of>1 year. We believe this user class is of value for Element and is relatively underserved at the moment.\n\nBeyond this, mStable alongside Element, are early adopters of the ERC-4626 standard drastically improving the composability of DeFi yield-bearing vaults. \n\nSave has recently been upgraded to be ERC-4626 compliant, the integration work of the vault shall be minimum.\n\nMore generally, the benefits would be:\n\n-   Consistently strong APY\n-   Long-term depositors attraction\n-   Trustless and battle-tested contract\n-   ERC-4626 compliant integration\n\nMore generally, we would love mStable Save to be part of the Element Finance ecosystem.\n\nIn the last few months, mStable has been heads down building a generalisable, composable and market-reactive multi-vault architecture powered by the ERC-4626 standard.\n\nAlso, we closely followed Element deployment on Aztec connect. mStable is very close to the Aztec team and is working on integrations on their network as well.\n\nSpecification\n-------------\n\nClassify the proposed new asset and all related underlying assets. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for risk analysis (DAO due diligence report) and for implementation to begin as well as testing. The specification for asset onboarding EGPs must include the following components:\n\nAsset Classification\n\n1.  *Name of the proposed asset.*\n\nmUSD \n\n1.  *Strategy or single yield source.*\n    1.  Underlying asset classification\n\nStablecoin\n\n1.  *List of all underlying assets*\n\nmUSD is the first meta-asset introduced by mStable. mUSD is a USD-pegged crypto asset in its own right, backed by a basket of selected USD stablecoins. The assets currently underlying mUSD include: USDC, USDT, DAI, sUSD\n\nAs of today, the basket breakdown (Liquidity + %) is the following: \n\n-   sUSD 3.62m 11.24%\n-   DAI 9.48m 29.42%\n-   USDC 9.67m 30.00%\n-   USDT 9.46m 29.34%\n\nIf the underlying asset(s) is a stablecoin.\n\n1.  *What mechanisms does it use to maintain stability?*\n\nmUSD is 1:1 backed by its underlying basket \n\nThe basket is constantly arbitraged through mUSD native AMM. Each asset within the basket has a set of max and min weights. Currently, these are set to 5% and 50%. This means that no single asset could make up more than 50% of the basket nor less than 5%. This is to limit exposure to a single underlying asset in the unlikely case of a depeg.\n\n1.  *If it's not a stablecoin, what drives the underlying asset(s) price?*\n\nN/A\n\n1.  *Yield source(s) according to each underlying asset.*\n    1.  Organic (e.g. lending, borrowing, underwriting risk).\n\nmStable deposits 98% of mUSD's underlying assets to established money markets to earn a base interest rate. This rate is then further increased by distributing mStable Swap fees and liquidating external protocol incentives.\n\nmUSD exposition breakdown is:\n\n-   40.5% to Aave\n-   59.5% to Compound\n\nIf we break down Save APY, 55% of it comes from lending interest revenues on Aave & Compound, 22.5% from our AMM swap fees & the remaining 22.5% from platform rewards liquidation. It would mean that 25% of Save's yield is independent of lending protocol and their inherent risk. Save APY is hence fully organic, market-neutral and ultra-consistent.\n\nAs of now, there is $13m deposited into Save on Mainet (Down from $45m ATH earlier this year)\n\n1.  *Emissions.*\n\nUnrelated to mUSD & Save\n\n1.  *Inflation.*\n\nUnrelated to mUSD & Save\n\n1.  *Enumerated underlying asset(s) liquidity.*\n2.  *Can the asset(s) protocol economics be modified?*\n    1.  What economic protocol parameters can be modified?\n\nEconomic protocols that can be modified are: fees, rewards liquidation destination\n\n1.  *What are the requirements to change protocol parameters?*\n\nmStable is a fully decentralized protocol. MTA holders can propose changes affecting contracts, fees level, and potentially new strategies.\n\nmStable is governed by MTA holders who have staked their tokens to participate in the community-based proposal system.\n\nAnyone can participate in the mStable governance process by joining discussions in either the discord or public forum. Ideas are then formalised and proposed to the community for on-chain signalling by MTA holders\n\n1.  Asset strategy fixed or flexible.\n    1.  *If flexible, who/what is able to modify the strategy?*\n\nMTA holders can propose changes affecting contracts, fees level, and potentially new strategies.\n\nHowever, it has been stated by the core team since the inception of the Save product that its risk level and strategy complexity will be serving a very specific risk profile and won't be changed.\n\n1.  *List all modification requirements and scenarios. *\n\nStablecoin Yield Source change\n\nProposed Term Duration\n----------------------\n\nTerm length: 2 months\n\nStart date: 01/10/2022\n\nTechnical Implementation\n------------------------\n\n-   The final code that will be used directly in the on-chain vote to execute the EGP.\n-   Refer to the [Yearn Vault AYearn Vault Asset Proxy Implementation Guide\n-   There should exists a whitelist of people who are qualified to create the implementations on-chain (i.e the proposal).\n-   Initially the whitelist will be individuals who have successfully created a proposal on-chain. Currently that list would be:\n-   Element Core Team\n-   Greg\n-   John\n-   Members who submit their own proposals (have the code written), and successfully execute on-chain, will be added to the whitelist.\n-   If a proposal requires implementation by someone else, the DAO will first enlist from the whitelist, if no one from the whitelist is able to take on that task, the DAO will put a bounty out for someone to make the proposal.\n-   This requires funds to exist that can be spent perhaps a few thousand dollars, and we can determine bounty sizes from there.\n\nTest Cases\n----------\n\nFor the implementation or testing of the technical implementation.\n\nSecurity Considerations\n-----------------------\n\nProposed Asset's Reputation and Security.\n\nmStable is a decentralized stablecoin ecosystem producing sustainable yield on USD. The protocol saw more than $6bn in transaction volume on its AMM, has been operating for 24 months without interruption or hacks and is one of the safest projects in DeFi for stablecoins.\n\nFor everything about risk, feel free to visit [this](https://docs.mstable.org/advanced/app-usage-terms-and-conditions)\n\n3\\.

      "title": "EGP-11: Working Groups Framework",
      "content": "**EGP: 11**\n**Title:** Working Groups Framework\n**Authors:** @Bobbay_StableNode @Re'em\n**Type:** Social Proposal\n**Date proposed:** August 26th, 2022\n**Date ratified:** N/A\n\n**EGP References:**\n[EGP-7: Bootstrap Workstream](https://forum.element.fi/discussion/6072-egp7-bootstrap-work-stream)\n\n**Sentence Summary**\n--------------------\n\nThis proposal provides a framework for creating, amending, and removing working groups and outlining their roles and responsibilities.\n\n**Paragraph Summary**\n---------------------\n\nEGP-XX: Working Group Framework provides a framework for creating, amending, and removing working groups, as well as clear roles and responsibilities for those involved in working groups. Working groups will help Element DAO streamline its work processes as decisions are made on a working-group level rather than a DAO level. Only working groups that align with the DAO's success should be active. \n\n**Motivation**\n--------------\n\nWorking groups are for Element DAO to distribute and decentralize their workload, as core DAO contributors would pass decisions at a working group level rather than passing *everything* by on the DAO level. With the introduction of pods, we have enabled working groups to work on a specific domain. As a result, Element DAO operates more efficiently.\n\nEach working group should contribute to the DAO's success in specific domains, enabling Element DAO to become a leader in DeFi. These working groups will include various roles, modifications, and accountability mechanisms to uphold a particular standard as well as enable flexibility.\n\nSpecification\n\n**Table of contents.**\n\n1.  Working groups\n    A.  Establishing a working group\n    B.  Removal of a working group\n    C.  Amendment of a working group\n2.  Accountability\n3.  Facilitators and contributors\n    A.  Minimum engagement levels\n4.  Communication Channels\n\n**Working groups**\n------------------\n\nWhat is a working group?\n\nWorking groups are the building blocks to help build a foundation. A working group is a team of individuals who share an alignment with Element DAO. These individuals come together and execute on a specific goal that the community perceives will bring improvement to the DAO.  \n\nA. Establishing a working group\n\n1.  To create a new working group, a [social proposal](https://forum.element.fi/discussion/4294-dao-social-proposal-template) must be followed and passed by the DAO as defined by ELFI governance.\n    A.  \"A new working group\" is any working group that is a new working group, adjacent or extended to any existing working group.\n2.  Within the social proposal, we recommend following the guidelines below to present a case for creating a working group.\n3.  Prior to putting forward the social proposal, it is best practice to have discussions with relevant core DAO contributors for support and feedback. This will help you understand whether a new working group is viable and needed in the current operational structure. \n    A. These conversations should occur in the Element Finance Discord within the #gov-general channel, under the \"Governance\" Section.\n    B.  Each working group has discord tags (@GOV xxx), so tag the relevant members to initiate a conversation.\n\nI. Domain of Operation\n\nDomain refers to the type of work a working group will undertake, such as operations, marketing, community, etc. Some working groups might have overlapping domains, but modular structures within pods such as sub-pods will help keep each pod distinct and reduce potential overlap.\n\nSuppose a new working group aims to work in a domain occupied by another working group. In that case, the new working group should outline how they plan to tackle different topics and reduce redundancy.\n\nii. Key Objectives\n\nKey objectives will clearly define the work performed by a working group and, in some cases, highlight how they won't overlap with other working groups if they are in a similar domain.\n\niii. Team background\n\nA working group is required to comprise of at least a single member, and each team member that is requesting to be onboarded shall document their previous experience. \n\nB. Removal of a working group\n\n1.  To dissolve a working group, a [social proposal](https://forum.element.fi/discussion/4294-dao-social-proposal-template) must be followed and passed by the DAO as defined by ELFI governance.\n2.  If there is an active snapshot proposal approved by 3 GSC members to dissolve a working group, all working group funds are frozen immediately, waiting for the vote result.\n3.  Upon the removal of a working group, all unspent operational funds are tobe immediately returned to the DAO treasury.\n4.  Within the social proposal, we recommend following the guidelines below to present a case for dissolving a working group.\n\nI. Working group in question\nii. Domain of working group.\niii. Reason for removal of a working group\niv. Evidence \n\nC. Amendment of a working group \n\n1.  To amend a working group, a [social proposal](https://forum.element.fi/discussion/4294-dao-social-proposal-template) must be followed and passed by the DAO as defined by ELFI governance.\n2.  Amendments include change of key objectives, change of facilitator, or other influential changes.\n3.  If there is an active snapshot proposal for amendments to a working group, funds should be frozen immediately until a change of objectives has been approved.\n\n**Accountability**\n--------------------\n\nEach working group will work transparently, giving the community insights into their work. ELFI holders are responsible for employing working groups that align with the DAO. We proposed the following rules for working groups to be held accountable:\n\n-   Working groups present monthly summaries in the commonwealth forum to detail their progress towards their key objectives. \n    -   Overview - What's been done this month?\n    -   Next steps - What's being worked on and is coming up next?\n    -   Reflection - What have we done well, and what could we have done better? (Leaving room for feedback)\n-   Facilitators of each working group will attend weekly meetings to present their progress and evaluate whether all working groups are aligned for the DAO.\n-   At least one member from a working group should attend bi-weekly community calls to represent the working group and answer any questions.\n\n**Facilitators and Contributors**\n----------------------------------\n\nA facilitator will have administrative work within their scope of work and are expected to follow the guidelines outlined below.\n\n-   Onboard contributors to the pod\n-   Coordinate the pod to reach their objectives\n-   Present monthly summaries in the forums \n-   Handle compensation for their working group\n-   Disclose if contributors aren't pulling their weight\n\n**Minimum Engagement Levels**\n\nCommunity members are also responsible for supporting working groups that act in the interest of ELFI DAO. The guideline outlined within this framework empowers community members to make any changes if deemed necessary by the DAO.\n\nFacilitators:\n\n-   Organize and lead meetings for your working group\n-   Attend community calls\n-   Responsible for tracking and updating the community on season goals\n-   Responsible for monitoring contributor participation in projects\n-   Participate in forum discussions\n-   Provide feedback for other WG documents/projects when required\n\nContributors:\n\n-   Attend meetings for your working group\n-   Attend community calls\n-   Choose and participate in specific projects for your WG\n-   Record your contribution and output\n-   Participate in forum discussions\n\nThese minimum requirements act as guidelines for the facilitators to evaluate whether contributors are eligible for compensation. Alongside the minimum engagement levels, below are a few different ways for facilitators to evaluate contributors.\n\n1.  Community participation\n    -  Attending working group meetings\n    -  Attending community governance meetings\n    -  Participation in forum discussions \n2.  Work ethic\n    -  Taking initiative \n    -  Collaborating with DAO contributors\n3.  Behavior\n    -  Adherence to the code of conduct\n    -  Open communication\n\nContributors have a responsibility to adhere to a high standard of work and, if not deemed suitable by the facilitator, can be removed from the working group.\n\n**Communication Channels**\n--------------------------\n\n**Working group Communication**\n\nWorking groups will be assigned a channel within the [Element Finance](https://discord.gg/GZAyVvzj) Discord under Element DAO where they can communicate or use another channel of their choice. \n\n**Cross-working-group Communication**\n\nWorking group members have the ability to look into other working group channels on discord allowing cross-communication between working groups. \n\nFacilitators will also be expected to attend weekly facilitator meetings to discuss any potential overlap in work and how to support each other.\n\n**Public Communication**\n\nWorking groups are expected to be transparent in all their work, posting monthly summaries in the forums to show their progress. All working group members will be reachable through discord or telegram.\n\n**Amendments**\n\nThis framework can be amended in the future by passing a social proposal.\n\n**Next Steps**\n---------------------\n1.Discuss this proposal on the forum and discord\n\nThe Operations pod is open to feedback and suggestions to improve the onboarding framework if needed.\n\n2\\. Implement a poll on this proposal on Snapshot\n\nOption A [YES]: The proposal will be executed, and the \"Working Groups Framework\" will be incorporated within Element Finance DAO.\nOption B [NO]: The \"Working Groups Framework\" will not be implemented into Element Finance DAO and needs further changes.\nOption C [Abstain]",

      "title": "EGP-10: Proposal Template Improvements",
      "content": "**Title:** Proposal Template Improvements\n**Authors:** @Bobbay_StableNode\n**Type:** Social Proposal\n**Status:** Draft\n**Date proposed:** August 22nd, 2022\n**Date ratified:** N/A\n\n**EGP References:**\n- [DAO (Social) Proposal Template](https://forum.element.fi/discussion/4294-dao-social-proposal-template)\n- [Protocol (Executable) Proposal Template](https://forum.element.fi/discussion/4293-protocol-executable-proposal-template)\n\n## Sentence Summary\nThis proposal presents a few adjustments to improve the current governance processes within Element DAO.\n\n## Paragraph Summary\nEGP-10: Proposal Template Improvements aims to provide a few adjustments to the current template and governance processes that are currently in place. The templates can only be adjusted through a social proposal, so we must follow the outlined processes to implement these changes. The other sections provide further insight into how future governance processes will be adjusted and executed.\n\n## Motivation\nCurrently, the present templates need some slight clarifications to make it easier for people to understand the process of presenting a proposal to the community. In standardizing these changes, we will uphold a high standard of proposal writing within the community and ensure that the necessary practices are followed.\n\n## Specification\nTable of contents.\n1. Add Abstain as an option.\n2. EGP-# Assignment\n3. Community Pod Involvement\n\n### Add “Abstain” as an option.\nAbstain should be an option in all votes since there could be a conflict of interest and lack of context for voters to decide, amongst other reasons. This proposal suggests that “abstain” is mentioned in the “Next Steps” section.\n\n![egp-10.png](ipfs://bafkreic3jlhg7vnv3rnsk4bmggyi2zrtjkpjwe7rg5sai3nwlfzazd5n6a)\n    \n“Add Abstain as an option.” can be added as a separate bullet point after the first bullet point.\n\n### EGP-# Assignment\nCurrently, EGPs are assigned their number by the proposal's author, whereas the template does mention “# to be assigned.” To put this into practice, we are currently at EGP-10, whereas we have only had four active proposals on snapshot. With a community pod in place, EGP-# will now be assigned by the community pod.\n\nInitially, when an EGP is in the draft, “#” should be assigned as mentioned in the template. Still, our subtle adjustment would clarify this difference to make the process easier for people to understand.\n“# to be assigned” will be changed to “# to be assigned by the Community Pod.”\n\n### Community Pod Involvement\nContributors within the Community Pod are expected to act as governance facilitators and ensure that these practices are upheld to ensure a tidy governance forum. This means they will ensure that all proposals follow the correct structure and process. As seen below, in between \"draft\" & \"proposed\", the community will provide governance support and assign an EGP number.\n\n \n[Idea] ➡️ [Draft] ➡️ [Proposed] ➡️ [Review] ➡️ [Off-chain Poll] ➡️ [Accepted/Rejected]\n    \n\nCurrently, one GSC member has to approve a proposal to bring it to snapshot. The “Community” pod will now ensure a proposal has followed the correct governance structure and process before moving forward to Snapshot. In practice, a GSC member will still approve a proposal, but prior to that “Community” pod will be expected to support the proposal at the \"Draft\" stage.\nThe “Community” pod is not meant to filter through any processes but to ensure that the correct structure is used. They will act with no bias.\n\n## Next Steps\n- Option A [YES]: The proposal will be executed, and adjustments will be made to the social and protocol templates. GSC and “Community” Pod will now have a shared responsibility to approve proposals to SnapShot.\n- Option B [NO]: The adjustments will be rejected and will not be implemented.\n",

This proposal will also detail the necessary technical implementation requirements and proposal lifecycle to onboard new assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOnboarding new assets is critical to the growth and composability of the protocol. Providing a framework for doing so ensures that potential assets can be appropriately evaluated in terms of structure, risk profile, and implementation effort in a standardized manner that reduces the potential for bias. This detailed evaluation is necessary to retain the integrity and reliability of Element.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Proposal Lifecycle\n\n1. Discussion\n2. Draft Proposal\n3. Check against the template\n    1. Modifications if necessary\n4. Off-chain vote\n5. If passed, perform due diligence report & audit/review\n6. Formal Proposal\n7. On-chain vote\n\n### Application Template\n\nEGP#: <# to be assigned>\n\nTitle: <EGP title>\n\nAuthor(s): <list of authors’ names and/or Twitter/GitHub handles>\n\nType: DAO Proposal Status: <Assigned by GSC or Forum moderators >\n\nDate Proposed: <yyyy-mm-dd>\n\nDate Ratified: <yyyy-mm-dd>\n\n### References\n\n- A list of supporting materials referenced by this EGP.\n\n### Sentence Summary\n\n- A description of what the Element Governance Proposal (EGP) is focused on in 30 words maximum.\n\n### Paragraph Summary\n\n- A description of what the Element Governance Proposal (EGP) is focused on.\n\n### Motivation\n\n- A short description of the motivation behind onboarding the new asset.\n\n### Specification\n\nClassify the proposed new asset and all related underlying assets. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for a risk analysis (DAO due diligence report) and for implementation to begin as well as testing. The specification for asset onboarding EGPs must include the following components:\n\n### Asset Classification\n\n1. Name of proposed asset.\n2. Strategy or single yield source.\n    1. Underlying asset classification.\n    2. List of all underlying assets.\n    3. If the underlying asset(s) is a stablecoin.\n        1. What mechanisms does it use to maintain stability?\n        2. If it’s not a stablecoin, what drives the underlying asset(s) price?\n        3. Yield source(s) according to each underlying asset.\n            1. Organic (e.g. lending, borrowing, underwriting risk).\n            2. Emissions.\n            3. Inflation.\n        4. Enumerated underlying asset(s) liquidity.\n    4. Can the asset(s) protocol economics be modified?\n        1. What economic protocol parameters can be modified?\n        2. What are the requirements to change protocol parameters?\n        3. Asset strategy fixed or flexible.\n            1. If flexible, who/what is able to modify the strategy?\n            2. List all modification requirements and scenarios. \\\n\n### Proposed Term Duration\n\n- Include the proposed term length and start date for new onboarded asset post on-chain approval.\n- The proposed term length should be no longer than 6 months.\n- The start_date can start no later than 2 months after on-chain approval.\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\n- The final code that will be used directly in the on-chain vote to execute the EGP.\n- Refer to the [Yearn Vault AYearn Vault Asset Proxy Implementation Guide\n- There should exists a whitelist of people who are qualified to create the implementations on-chain (i.e the proposal).\n- Initially the whitelist will be individuals who have successfully created a proposal on-chain. Currently that list would be:\n- Element Core Team\n- Greg\n- John\n- Members who submit their own proposals (have the code written), and successfully execute on-chain, will be added to the whitelist.\n- If a proposal requires implementation by someone else, the DAO will first enlist from the whitelist, if no one from the whitelist is able to take on that task, the DAO will put a bounty out for someone to make the proposal.\n- This requires funds to exist that can be spent perhaps a few thousand dollars, and we can determine bounty sizes from there.\n\n### Test Cases\n\nFor the implementation or testing of the technical implementation.\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nProposed Asset’s Reputation and Security.\n\n1. List of all directly related protocols to the classified assets above.\n    1. All relevant audit information including a report (if public).\n    2. If not public it needs to be acknowledged.\n2. List any past vulnerabilities or exploits (including stolen funds).\n3. List any exploits or discovered vulnerabilities by white hat or bounty programs.\n\n### Technical Review Plan or Audit Information\n\n- Third party audit provided and or sign-off from security pod\n\n### Next Steps (Voting Outcome Summary)\n\nClearly outline the next steps for this proposal. This includes a recommended review period for the technical solution, what voting “yes”, “no” and “abstain” entails, and what the outcome and next steps would be if the proposal were to pass the Off-Chain Poll and On-Chain Vote.\n\n- For example:\n    - Discuss this proposal on the forum and discord.\n    - Implement a poll on this proposal on Snapshot.\n        - If passed: This proposal will move to an audit review period.\n    - A code review process will take X and should not be moved to an On-Chain vote before it has been deemed safe.\n    - Implemented a vote on this proposal on Element Governance Dashboard\n        - If passed: This proposal will be executed and the following will be implemented into the Element Protocol or the Element Council Protocol.\n\n## Due Diligence Report (Performed by Protocol & Security Pod)\n\n### Factual Presentation\n\nThis section should attempt to answer the questions below as applicable to the asset being onboarded.

      "title": "EGP-9 - Onboard bb-a-USD",
      "content": "# EGP-9\nTitle: Onboard bb-a-USD\nAuthors: @Max | FIAT DAO\nType: Executable Proposal\nStatus: Draft\nDate proposed: July 28th, 2022\nDate ratified:\n\n## References\n1. bb-a-USD Pool\n2. Balancer Boosted Pool Documentation\n3. Yearn Vault Strategy\n4. Aura Finance Documentation\n\n## Sentence Summary\nThis proposal calls for the addition of a Yearn Finance strategy that auto-compounds deposits of the bb-a-USD Balancer Finance pool via Aura Finance as a supported yield originator. \n\n## Paragraph Summary\nBalancer Finance allows for the rehypothecation of liquidity provider assets into yield-bearing strategies via its Asset Manager functionality. Its flagship proof of concept is the Aave-boosted pool, which deploys USDC, DAI, and USDT into Aave in accordance with its trading volumes. This allows for higher yields and reduces the opportunity cost present in underutilized stableswap pools. \nIn parallel to this development, not only has Balancer Finance implemented its veBAL system, but Aura Finance has also committed to subsidizing governance-favored Balancer pools. This means that bb-a-USD LPs can receive i) trading fees, ii) rehypothecation yields, iii) $BAL emissions, and iv) $AURA emissions. Accordingly, Yearn Finance has developed a strategy capable of a) depositing bb-a-USD Balancer Pool Tokens into Aura Finance, and b) auto-compounding the position as it earns $BAL and $AURA. This strategy is expected to be finalized by mid-August and stands to be added to the Yearn Finance frontend pending a governance vote.\n\n## Motivation\n\nbb-a-USD represents the second largest pool on Balancer Finance with $130M in TVL at the time of writing. It typically deploys between 80 and 85% of its liquidity into AAVE, implying a blended 0.74% yield with current lending rates. Factoring in both $BAL and $AURA emissions, this comes out to ~6% APR prior to any auto-compounding executed by Yearn Finance. As an originator, it presents a compelling combination of organic yield as well as consistent governance token emissions. \n\nFurthermore, we at FIAT DAO see a clear win-win-win opportunity for ourselves, Element Finance, and Balancer Finance should bb-a-USD come to be supported. We would look to add support for yvBlpbb-a-USD principal tokens as collateral for minting $FIAT, which has liquidity primarily on Balancer Finance via our “FUD” pool. Users would be able to leverage their exposure to the bb-a-USD pool, resulting in locked TVL for both Balancer and Aura. If that strategy proves popular, we believe Balancer and Aura governance would have an incentive to subsidize $FIAT liquidity in order to increase the strategy’s capacity. \nThe end state of such a scenario playing out would be: \n- Recurring TVL for Element\n- Deep secondary liquidity for $FIAT\n- Locked TVL for Balancer, Aura\n\n## Specification\n\nElement Finance currently supports multiple Yearn Finance vault strategies as yield originators. In speaking with Yearn Finance contributors, the production-ready version of the bb-a-USD vault is expected to be deployed in mid-August. Moreover, bb-a-USD itself will be undergoing a migration to a patched contract imminently.\nFor users interested in learning more, please refer to the following:\n- Preliminary Auto-Compounding Strategy\n- Most Recent Update on bb-a-USD Migration\n- Aura Finance Audit by Halborn\nNext Steps\n1. Discuss concerns or questions regarding bb-a-USD and the Yearn strategy\n2. Conduct a snapshot poll to approve yvBlpbb-a-USD vault as an originator\n3. Confirm finalization of both vault and successful migration of bb-a-USD\n4. Deploy Element Finance pool for yvBlpbb-a-USD with an initial maturity date set for March 23rd, 2023 4\n",

      "title": "EGP-7: Bootstrap Work Stream",
      "content": "# EGP-7\n## Title: Bootstrap Work Stream\nAuthors: @Bobbay_StableNode @Re'em (Component)\nType: Social Proposal\nDate proposed: July 8th, 2022\n## Sentence Summary\nThe bootstrap work stream’s purpose is to initialize focused governance contributions in a temporary non-formal manner to reach full operational functionality.\n## Motivation\nCurrently, there is no workflow process for contributors to actively contribute to the DAO. \nWe believe there should be a temporary work stream to encourage the DAO to become active and get necessary tasks completed until we have the work stream ready to transition to a more formal structure. \n## Paragraph Summary\nA main consideration is that currently ELFI tokens are solely voting tokens and have no liquid monetary value at the moment. This means that the incentive to contribute to the temporary work stream is focused on ambitious contributors who would like to be compensated in voting tokens rather than USDC. This will change over time as we transition into formal operations with monetary assets on the Element DAO treasury balance sheet. \nInterchangeable terms: “working group”, “pod”, and “service provider”.\n## Overview | Scope of Work\nThe temporary work stream provides a somewhat formal structure for teams to work towards their goals and objectives. \nThis work stream will act as a governance experiment to identify the ideal operating practices for the Element DAO helping us define the structure and processes for contributing to the DAO. We plan to incorporate pods from Orca Protocol similar to ENS as it simplifies the workflow.\nWe present the first three temporary initial working groups.\nOperations\n\n1) Decentralized workforce (formal operation) \n2) Governance processes to formalize the workflow\n3) Compensation (overlap with economics?) \n\nCommunity\n\n1) Governance facilitator/coordinator\n2) Increase community engagement in governance participation\n3) Regular scheduling, recording, transcribing, and prep of community calls\n4)  “Why do we care about Element DAO, and why do we want to participate?”\n5) Alignment of vision/mission/values/north star\n6) Creation of code of conduct \n\nEconomics\n\n1) Tokenomics\n2) Revenue generation \n\nEach working group needs a minimum of three contributors and one as a facilitator. This ensures that there is enough community participation behind a working group. \nEach pod can have up to five people before the pod should be closed to new contributors. This is to limit the number of contributors so a pod does not become overcrowded; however pods can create subpods to further specialize. \nFacilitators and Contributors\nFacilitator Responsibilities:\n\n- Onboard contributors to the pod\n- Coordinate the pod to reach their objectives\n- Present monthly summaries in forums and governance calls\n- Handle payment for their working group\n- Disclose if contributors aren’t pulling their weight \n\nPotential Facilitators\n\n- Operations: Bobby (StableNode) \n- Community: Mitzy\n- Economics: 0xBew (Yunt Capital) \n\nHow are facilitators and contributors paid?\n\n- Retroactive payment using co-ordinape.\n- Each work stream is given X amount of tokens and they can use co-ordinape to dish out a percentage of tokens.\n- Individuals that contribute to a pod and are valued by their peers are more likely to receive a higher amount of ELFI (+ USDC)* than an individual who contributes less. \n- We will limit the amount of ELFI (+ USDC) that one can receive through co-ordinape to ensure a balanced distribution.\n-  Facilitators will have a bonus due to the extra workload they possess. \n- Add minimum engagement levels & expectations to be compensated \n\n*Based on the treasury at the time, if there is enough USDC\nMinimum Engagement Levels\nFacilitators:\n\n- Organise and lead meetings for your working group\n- Attend community calls\n- Responsible for tracking and updating the community on season goals\n- Responsible for tracking contributor participation in projects\n- Participate in forum discussions\n- Provide feedback for other WG documents/projects when required \n\nContributors:\n\n- Attend meetings for your working group\n- Attend community calls\n- Choose and participate in specific projects for your WG\n- Record your contribution and output\n- Participate in forum discussions \n\nHow do you propose a working group?\nWe believe that we should keep it simple and focus on the initial four working groups for now, but through this discussion, we could identify other possible working groups. \nIf this proposal passes, we believe that working groups can be proposed through the following requirements.\n\n- One lead facilitator\n- Minimum of three contributing members\n- Reason for the working group\n- Experience \n\nAn official template will be made later by the operations team.\nHow to join a working group?\nWe believe that the lead facilitator should have the opportunity to decide who works within the working group so each facilitator would have their own “application” to join the working group. They should revolve around skill set and relevant experience.\nTo the future\nWe want to make it clear that this proposed structure is temporary, and mechanisms such as payment will undergo changes as we work on formalizing the decentralized workforce of Element Finance. We wanted to simplify the process to contribute to the DAO and get ELFI to individuals who believe in the future of Element Finance.\nFurther work\n\n- Code of conduct for working group members\n- Notion board to summarize working groups (aims, responsibilities, and lead facilitator) \n\nNext Steps\nAfter further discussion, I will initiate a snapshot poll with the options below.\nOption A [YES] is a vote to initiate the first three pods for the bootstrap work stream.\nOption B [NO] is a vote to not continue with the pods structure for the bootstrap work stream.",

      "content": "# EGP-5\n## Title: Enable Temporary Protocol Incentives for Liquidity Providers\nAuthor(s): @MacnBTC\nType: Protocol Proposal\nStatus: Executable\nDate Proposed: July 20th, 2022\n## Sentence Summary\nEnable protocol incentives to keep TVL in the protocol, and increase network distribution to more users prior to ELFI unlock. \n## Paragraph Summary\nDiscussing a fair short term incentive program before enabling transferability of ELFI. As Element’s vaults begin to expire, the necessity of incentivizing rollover is getting more and more important to help retain liquidity in the protocol. The fixed income markets require liquidity to create the opportunity for fixed rate purchasers to earn a fixed rate with minimal slippage. \n\n## Motivation\n\n- Retain TVL in the protocol, increasing the spread of the token distribution to more power users of the Element protocol. \n- Further increase distribution and the amount of ELFI holders\n- Distribution of ELFI to power users providing liquidity to active (non-matured) vaults (Version 1.1 vaults). \n\n## Specification\nWe propose 1% of the total ELFI supply distributed over 6 months divided across all the vaults. This gives a yearly emission rate of 2% which is argumentatively enough to retain and attract users without overly inflating the ELFI supply. \n \nThis is including and counting the vaults launched recently, with the most recent upgrade of Version 1.1. The individuals LPing in those vaults have been using and supporting the protocol without incentives even after the airdrop snapshot was announced. We propose to reward their time spent in the vault at the same emission rate.\nThis proposal would begin rewarding users effectively at the expiration of the April 29th vaults at a daily proportional rate proposed. Reasoning for this is due to the fact that this proposal is not likely to get passed until a later date, but retaining liquidity and incentivizing rollovers is necessary NOW. \n \n## Technical: \n\nThis aspect will use the open sourced Element script that performed data analysis for the previous Element airdrop to reward historical LP’ers/users.\n \nAs soon as it passes the snapshot, construct a merkel root for that date. \n \nThis proposal is an experimental measure to retain users and TVL in the protocol while GSC and governance can focus on discussing different issues and solving current ones (EGP-1, EGP-2, and EGP-3). \nTechnical Implementation\n1. Deploy the modified masterchef rewards contract which only withdraws to governance https://github.com/element-foundation/peripherals/blob/main/contracts/MCMod.sol\nWe want to deploy the Liquidity Mining contract from the open sourced Element Repo.\n2. The vote will use the script developed by @Gregory | ChainSafe as a template, but instead of calling GSC, it will call the treasury contract to transfer tokens into the Liquidity Mining contract.",
