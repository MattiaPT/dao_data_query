      "content": "# The Developer DAO Bounty Board\n\nAuthors: mannyornothing Kirsten (TalentLayer)\n\nThis is the official proposal up for consideration and an official vote by the DAO.\n\n[View the discussion from the last stage of the proposal here](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-introducing-the-developer-dao-bounty-board/2889).\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal outlines the implementation and management of the Developer DAO Bounty Board. The goal is to create a user-centric platform that allows D_D members and the broader community to access quality open-source bounty opportunities posted by D_D partner organisations. In order to post on the Developer DAO Bounty Board, organisations must be Developer DAO members. The proposal also details planned features and a monetization model to help the DAO generate recurring revenue fees.\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Bringing earning opportunities to DAO members**\n\nThe Developer DAO Bounty Board will be a place where DAO members can go to access a wide range of open-source bounties so they can get hands-on experience and earn money while doing it.\n\n**Scaling Developer DAO’s bounty program**\n\nPreviously we have been manually managing bounties for individual organisations. This takes a lot of administrative time. We get a lot of inbound requests from organisations that want to post bounties for DAO members, but we don’t have the capacity to service them all when we have to do posts, publicity, and payments manually. Because of this, a lot of bounties that could be available to DAO members never happen.\n\nThe Developer DAO Bounty Board will help us scale our bounties program and create an easy place for organisations to post bounties themselves, as long as they are DAO members. This will convert the steady stream of requests for sponsoring bounties into REAL and accessible opportunities for DAO members.\n\n**Bringing engaging activities for new DAO members**\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for the DAO is engaging new members after they are onboard. When new DAO members arrive, but don’t see anything “actionable” they can do to contribute, they get demotivated and deprioritize DAO participation.\n\nIf we have open-source bounties available consistently for new DAO members to work on, we can instantly engage new members and keep them coming back to the DAO repeatedly; a growing community.\n\n**Creating new revenue streams for the DAO**\n\nDeveloper DAO will have the ability to configure fees of various types on the Developer DAO Bounty Board. This can generate consistent and growing revenue for the DAO as more people use the bounty board.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\n### Domain of Operations & Team\n\n**Domain:**\nManagement and maintenance of the Developer DAO Bounty Board and promotion of the board to potential bounty sponsor organisations.\n\n**Team:**\nkirsten (DAO Member, Executive Lead at TalentLayer) - Responsible for managing development and maintenance of the Developer DAO Bounty Board, and assisting with onboarding bounty sponsor organisations.\n\ntalentlayer (External Organization) - Responsible for the development and maintenance of the Developer DAO Bounty Board\n\n kempsterrrr &  mannyornothing - Responsible for supporting publicity and partnerships.\n\n### OKRs\n\n||BUILD||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O1|The Developer DAO Bounty Board platform is launched|Owner|\n|KR|The platform is live and accessible to D_D members to post bounties on and search for opportunities with.|Kirsten|\n|KR|The platform receives updates and additional features as needed.|Kirsten|\n\n||BUILD||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O2|Bounties are being consistently posted on the platform|Owner|\n|KR|A publicity schedule is defined and implemented to boost awareness of the Bounty Board across potential bounty sponsor organisations.| kempsterrrr|\n|KR|A team is discussing bounty sponsor partnerships with organisations, and assisting them to post to the platform.| kempsterrrr /  mannyornothing|\n\n||BUILD||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O3|DAO Members are aware of bounty opportunities|Owner|\n|KR|A publicity schedule is defined and implemented to boost awareness of the Bounty Board across DAO members and other developers.| kemspterrrrr|\n|KR|A bot is created for the Developer DAO Discord to post all new bounties in a feed for DAO members to access easily.| kirsten|\n\n||GOVERN||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O4|The Bounty Board is generating revenue for the DAO|Owner|\n|KR|A pricing model is determined and implemented on the Bounty Board.| mannyornothing|\n\n### Written Scope of Work\n\n**Product Summary**\n\nThe Developer DAO Bounty Board will be a full bounty and grants marketplace with a web 3 native user experience. It will be built using BuilderPlace, a white-label TalentLayer-based bounty board builder. It will be able to be hosted on a custom domain or subdomain of Developer DAO. It will have the Developer DAO colour pallet and logo on the site.\n\n**Features Summary**\n\nToken Gating: Only Developer DAO members can post jobs (NFT holder or a wallet holding enough $CODE)\n\nFeatured posts: Developer DAO can charge bounty sponsors for featured posts that rank at the top of the bounties page. This can be managed in the admin centre of the platform.\n\nMonetization: Various fees can be configured on the bounty board through the admin centre including:\n\n1. Percentage fees on transactions\n2. Fees to post jobs\n\nSeal of Approval for D_D members: Developer DAO members will rank higher in applications for bounties, and will have a seal of approval on their profile in the platform.\n\n**Services Summary**\n\nThe TalentLayer community (acting as BuilderPlace under 44 Labs OU) will provide the following services ongoing to the DAO to support the Bounty Board.\n\n* Hosting\n* Maintenance (updating code, removing bugs)\n\n**Expansion**\n\nAdditional features, programmes, or other expansions can be detailed in further proposals. We expect this to be an ongoing project for years to come and there will surely be improvements to be made outside the scope of this proposal.\n\n### Budget Request (Including value returned to the DAO)\n\n**Value Returned to the DAO:**\n\nThe Developer DAO Bounty Board can have fees configured by the DAO to generate revenue for the treasury and value accrual for $CODE and Developer DAO NFTs.\n\nTransaction Fees: A configurable percentage fee that comes out of any bounty pay-out payments made on the platform.\n\nPosting Fees: A fee for posting bounties.\n\nSponsored post fees: A fee charged to companies to highlight their post at the top of bounty results.\n\nIncreased demand for $CODE and D_D NFTs: Because you must be a D_D member to post bounties, any organisation who wants to post bounties must purchase either an NFT or $CODE. This generates buy pressure which should support the value of each asset.\n\n**Budget Requested**\n\nWe request a budget of 35,000 CODE from the DAO treasury for the following purposes:\n\nBounty pool: 30,000 CODE\n\nCODE will be issued to all bounties as an extra incentive. The specifics of this have not been worked out yet so we’re requesting enough to allow for experimentation. Any unused CODE would be returned to the Treasury or factored into any future budget.\n\nReward for TalentLayer Contribution: 5,000 (agreement to hold and participate in Governance for 12 months)\n\nTotal Budget: 5,000\n\nAddress to send budget - 0x81B3E58186E40c3143eEdE1eac88eedfC7cFeb5F (TalentLayer DAO Multisig)\n\n**Fee Split 44 Labs OU (Managed by TalentLayer Community)**\n\n44 Labs OU will receive a non-configurable 2% fee on payment transactions. This is intended to cover development, hosting, and maintenance of the platform.\n\n**Drawbacks**\n\n* 35,000 CODE cost to the Treasury",

It aims to be a unique asset in the community by being a place where developers can get answers, saving them time and stress on searching for and choosing tools.\n\nAdding this to the Developer DAO newsletter will provide useful content to developers who are outside of the DAO. It will also be a great vehicle to grow new partnerships with protocols as well as deepen the relationship with existing protocols we work with.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\n### Domain of Operations & Team\n\nIn collaboration with the existing Newsletter team, we will work to:\n\n* Ensure content is edited and maintains a high-quality\n* Delivery of the newsletter to readers promptly\n* Develop a clear brand to avoid confusion with the core newsletter\n* Work within the DAO to ensure that pressing questions and topics of interest are covered in this series\n* Collaborate with the Partnerships team to seek opportunities to align on content\n\nOKRs\n\n||VIBE||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O1|Foster a fun and safe Member experience|Owner|\n|KR|||\n\n||LEARN||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O2|Provide DAO members with high-quality learning opportunities|Owner|\n|KR|Educate members on protocols and developer tools|DappaDan|\n\n||BUILD||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O3|Support DAO members to elevate their impact on the world|Owner|\n|KR|Giving newer writers an opportunity to contribute|DappaDan|\n\n||GOVERN||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O4|Position the DAO structurally and financially for long-term success|Owner|\n|KR|Newsletter Subscriber Growth|DappaDan|\n\n### Budget Request (Including value returned to the DAO)\n\nEach issue takes ~3 days to research and write, so I am requesting 500 CODE to cover this plus any extra time to coordinate with others in the DAO.

      "title": "P-36: Implementing oSnap for Optimistic Governance",
      "content": "**Authors:** Bobbay, Manny & Alex @ UMA\n\n### Summary\n\nThe adoption of oSnap for Developer DAO would eliminate the need for multisig execution by automatically executing successful Snapshot votes onchain, thus consolidating the governance process to one gasless vote on Snapshot that results in onchain execution.\n\n### Motivation\n\nWe believe decentralized governance is critical to the entire web3 ecosystem. The traction of oSnap has shown us that DAOs are increasingly committing to this as well; as such, UMA continues developing oSnap with no fees for the betterment of the industry at large.\n\nAdding oSnap streamlines the execution of governance decisions, brings a new layer of efficiency and reliability to Developer DAO. This requires minimal effort and no disruption to existing DAO governance processes. UMA even covers the onchain execution costs for every oSnap proposal.\n\noSnap secures over $300M for treasuries including CoW Protocol, Across, Connext and Shapeshift. A dashboard of all oSnap users can be viewed [here](https://dune.com/risk_labs/osnap-total-value-secured). oSnap was built by UMA, an experienced leader in optimistic verification. UMA’s optimistic oracle currently secures $700M of TVS across bridges, prediction markets and governance tools.\n\n### Scope of Work\n\noSnap Safe app lets you add oSnap to your Snapshot space and Safe in a few minutes with no developer time required. A video demonstration of the oSnap Safe App can be viewed [here](https://docs.uma.xyz/developers/osnap/osnap-quick-start).\n\nOnce enabled, Snapshot proposals can optionally enable oSnap and include transaction payloads within the proposal to be automatically executed after a successful snapshot vote. Learn how to upload a proposal with oSnap [here](https://www.loom.com/share/5c4f416e9bd649c2a086ff34f8440d3d?sid=bc8c2f1e-ac2a-47f0-895a-1a475950ec4b&resume-anon-signup=true).\n\nThe updated Snapshot flow for proposals that include transaction payloads would be:\n\n* An oSnap-enabled Snapshot proposal incorporates transaction data, to be verified and executed upon passing, with a user-friendly builder for creating and verifying token transfers.\n* CODE holders vote on the proposal like any other Safe Snapshot proposal\n* If CODE holders approve the proposal by vote, any address can post a bond (2 WETH) for a challenge period (1 to 3 days) and propose to execute the transactions onchain. UMA has imple\n* mented a bot that validates proposals (vote passed, meets min voting period/quorum) and posts the bond for DAOs along with covering gas costs for execution (there are no fees to use oSnap).\n* If no dispute arises about the proposal’s accuracy during the challenge period, the transactions can then be executed. **This is also executed by UMA’s bots**\n* In case of a dispute, the proposal is not executed.\n\nHere are examples of where oSnap would have streamlined the process:\n\n* [P-32: Academy Sub-DAO Budget - 2023 Q3-Q4](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0xeab8eb8c0fc4b07d3c7a79be3d33d34513049ae5e620647494f2b5185e1bfe3b)\n* [P-31: Agency Q3 + Q4 Budgets](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0x6af9d33210ced7438532a40cdc9a2236e8910cfcfb7191633cbef70c53ea7208)\n* [Labs Budget - 2023-Q3](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0xa4e9c1cf86839fb6682ceed5e2b33d95ba4182aa4bb6072840fcddd5e66370e7)\n\n### Dispute process\n\n* Anyone can dispute by navigating to https://oracle.uma.xyz/ and finding the relevant proposal to initiate a dispute by posting a bond.\n* UMA token holders vote to resolve the dispute, with the correct party rewarded from the opposing party’s bond. This bonding and dispute mechanism punishes incorrect proposers and disputers and incentivizes honest disputes.\n* Any proposal that was incorrectly disputed can be re-proposed to the oracle for execution without requiring revoting. It is important to note, the dispute resolution decided by UMA token holder votes are not deciding if the transactions can be executed or not, only the bond allocation between the proposer and disputer..\n\n### Monitoring\n\nUMA has also focused significant resources on monitoring efforts:\n\n* The same bot that proposes and executes transactions also automatically disputes inaccurate proposals if the following criteria are not met:\n  * The proposed onchain transactions match the transactions that were approved in the Snapshot proposal\n  * The Snapshot proposal passed with the minimum parameters specified (majority in favor, meets minimum voting period and quorum)\n  * The proposal follows the strategy specified in the Snapshot space.\n* Proposals are included in the UMA Oracle UI (https://oracle.uma.xyz/) which is the same interface used by disputers verifying and disputing for other third-party integrations (Polymarket, Sherlock, Cozy, and other oSnap integrations).\n* UMA sponsors a verification program, that pays UMA community members to verify all optimistic oracle assertions so when any transactions are proposed through oSnap, a Discord ticket is automatically created and an experienced verifier from the UMA community completes a multi-step verification process that focuses on areas such as the transaction payload matching the intent of the proposal, verifies transactions do not include interactions with malicious contracts, etc.\n\n### SafeGuards\n\nDAOs can take it a step further by adding the [Roles modifier](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-roles) via the Zodiac module to specify which addresses can call the relevant functions in the Delay modifier to veto transactions. This way, a trusted individual can be given permission to veto transactions without having full admin control over the Safe.\n\nDAOs can take it a step further by adding the [Roles modifier](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-roles) via the Zodiac module to specify which addresses can call the relevant functions in the Delay modifier to veto transactions. In this oSnap deployment, the Developer DAO [Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7128f5ff32eD07Ce12E6a9deBE32BB40F9884b3C) will have permission to veto transactions.\n\nThere is still an important trust consideration: If the holder of the veto power is malicious or makes a mistake, they can disrupt the execution of a proposal without having to post a disputer bond.\n\n### Drawbacks\n\nWhile oSnap has been audited by Open Zeppelin, as with any system, there may be unforeseen vulnerabilities.\n\nHere are the audit reports by Open Zeppelin:\n\n* [OptimisticGovernor Audit](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/uma-optimistic-governor-audit)\n* [OptimisticGovernor Audit for Contract Updates](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/uma-optimistic-governor-incremental-audit)\nThere is still an important trust consideration: If the holder of the veto power is malicious or makes a mistake, they can disrupt the execution of a proposal without having to post a disputer bond.\n\n### Vote\nDAO Voting strategy is currently 1 CODE token 1 vote. \n\nFor\nAbstain\nAgainst",

      "content": "### Authors: kempsterrrr\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal creates a new section on the DAO Handbook for listing redeemable membership benefits such as discounted RPC access from Grove and Nodies as part of our preferred partnerships with POKT Network.\n\nThis proposal is putting forth (but not limited to) the following items to a vote :\n\n- Listing fee charged to partners\n- Minimum duration of paid listing fees\n- A PR has been opened on the handbook repo to create the perks page.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe motivations behind this proposal are as follows:\n\n- Reward our community by providing more intrinsic value for DAO membership\n- Provide a non-intrusive way to connect partners with members\n- Create opportunity to grow the treasury\n- This concept was validated by the P3RKS team whereby members were interested in such benefits and partners were interested in providing them.\n- Sadly, the P3RKS team decided to sunset their project so this proposal seeks to re-create the value natively in the DAO with minimum fuss.\n\n# Scope of Work\n\nThe proposed solution is simple:\n\n- Create a member perks/benefits page on the Handbook.\n- List benefits using Gitbook Cards.\n- Link to a DeForm to verify token holdings\n- Automate distribution of perk via make.com.\n- Charge partners via listing fee or affiliate commission to generate revenue of the Treasury\n\n# Model\n\nDAO Membership Perks will optimise for value accrual in memberships to the DAO.\n\nRather than charge for listings, the aim is to pursue the high quality and value for membership by passing all savings onto them where possible. In some case where the only option is to enter into an affiliate agreement with where the DAO makes a commission on each signed up user, 100% of those funds will be return to the treasury.\n\n# What perks can be listed\n\nTo be listed on the platform a perk must benefit members and provide revenue for the DAO either directly via a listing fee or affiliate agreement, or as part of a separate partnership agreement.\n\nAs an interim solution, perks will be proposed on the Coordination call and optimistically added unless there is an objection from someone present on the call. Anyone can propose a perk.\n\n# Drawbacks\n\nThis solution is intentionally simple, relying on DeForm and Make.com to provide a quick functional solution for members. It acknowledges there is likely a better solution to this that could be built in the future should the DAO decide to replace this setup. It also acknowledges there is likely room for improvement on the process for selecting listing in the future.\n\n# Vote\n\nSingle choice voting where one CODE token equals one vote and whichever option has the most votes the the end successful assuming quorum of over 2% of CODE supply (200k votes).\n\nIf a draw, we optimistically default to For.\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Abstain",

Whilst this served its purpose to a degree, sustaining this model has proved challenge and had the following impacts:\n\n1. Proposal have been stuck in Governance for long periods of time\n2. Stewards not involved in the day-to-day operation of the DAO have struggled to maintain sufficient context to perform their roles\n\nThis proposal aims to help us start addressing these challenges by unblocking the current process so we can elevate proposal faster\n\n## Scope of Work\n\nThis change is simple and only requires an update of the relevant Governance documentation in the incoming [DAO Handbook](https://handbook.developerdao.com/about-the-dao/governance-process) - [here is a PR](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/handbook/pull/1) to submit these changes if the proposal passes\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nThe main drawback is reducing sybil resistance in Governance by reducing the threshold needed to elevate votes to Snapshot.\n\n## Vote\nSingle choice voting where one CODE token equals one vote and whichever option has the most votes the the end successful assuming quorom of over 2% of CODE supply (200k votes). \n\nIf a draw, we optimistically default to For.\n\n- For\n- Against\n- Abstain",

      "title": "P-32: Academy Sub-DAO Budget - 2023 Q3-Q4",
      "content": "# Academy Sub-DAO - 2023 Q3-Q4\n\nAuthors: @wolovim, @Piablo, @markkos89.eth, @uma\n\n_This is an iteration on the never-ratified [S2 proposal](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-academy-sub-dao/2711)._\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish Academy as a sub-DAO of Developer DAO, based on the current [DAO Governance Structure](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-dao-governance-structure-upgrade/2615).\n\nAcademy is an educational platform for builders, seeking to onboard DAO members and the wider public into both the DAO and the broader web3 industry by providing quality content, support, and a great user experience. An [MVP](https://academy.developerdao.com/) is available and being iterated on today, while a full redesign (”V2”) is also in development.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Academy team works to fulfill the main mission of Developer DAO: to educate and onboard web3 contributors. What started as a study group grew into a full effort to build a free and high-quality platform to empower builders to make an impact in this industry. The intention is to provide project-based learning tracks that lift developers out of “tutorial hell” and into mid-level skills and beyond. Academy is fully aligned with D_D’s mission to “Accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of web3 builders.”\n\n## Brand Usage\n\nD_D Academy will continue to be hosted as a subdomain on the DAO domain and be closely affiliated with the DAO, while maintaining a separate brand. V2 designs are similar, but not identical to DAO branding. The Academy logo and other components are subject to change as a part of that redesign.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\nThe Academy team is building a free-to-learn education platform. Prior to this budget, an MVP has been designed, developed, and deployed. Since the MVP, new team members have joined and design thinking exercises have been facilitated to explore a roadmap from here. In Q3 and Q4, the focus is on completing the redesign, introducing a couple more learning tracks, and accommodating Preferred Partner initiatives.\n\n## Team\n\nAcademy is to be a sub-DAO of Developer DAO, and as such, intends to operate with a flexible and autonomous structure that allows for experimentation and iteration.\n\n### Structure\n\nAs a team, we task ourselves with delivering and maintaining a robust and meaningful web3 education platform. Together, we have combined decades of professional experience across web development, education & pedagogy, technical writing, product development, and design. Stewards in those core areas:\n\nProduct & Design: uma\nDevelopment: markkos89\nPedagogy & Content: piablo\nPM/Sub-DAO Coordinator: wolovim\n\nThe specifics of how each domain performs its functions will be documented along the way as best practices are discovered. Further, there has been and likely will continue to be significant domain crossover between individuals in these roles.\n\nThese Stewards will be signers on the Academy multisig and the sub-DAO will operate without a separate entity, under The Developer DAO Foundation, abiding by relevant requirements.\n\nThe Sub-DAO Coordinator role is defined in the D_D Labs team budget and - paraphrasing - is responsible for ensuring rewards are processed and the sub-DAO is represented and accountable at appropriate Developer DAO internal and external events.\n\n### Stewards\n\nThe Academy Steward role conveys accountability, not necessarily authority. When a decision in a particular domain needs to be made, it is the responsibility of the Steward to make sure that happens by gathering input, facilitating conversations, and gaining consent from affected parties to move forward with a solution that is “safe enough to try.”\n\nAside from product decisions, the allocation of rewards within a domain is one more decision which should follow a similar consent-driven process driven by the relevant Steward. Acknowledging that this is experimental, Stewards and contributors are expected to document the process as best practices are discovered.\n\n### Contributors\n\nAny member of Developer DAO can join weekly meetings or engage in the Academy Discord channels to learn about opportunities to contribute. The Academy documentation is to be kept up to date with more specific and timely context. \n\n### OKRs\n\n|  | LEARN |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Q3/4 | Provide learners with high-quality learning opportunities | Owner (Steward) |\n| KR | Research and design v2 of the Learner UX | Product/Design |\n| KR | Implement and deploy v2 of the Learner UX | Development |\n| KR | Enable users to store their progress | Development |\n| KR | Optimize the website and lessons for SEO | Product/Design |\n| KR | Publish at least one lesson in three homegrown tracks | Pedagogy/Content |\n| KR | Publish one beta partner lesson | Pedagogy/Content |\n| KR | Facilitate discovery of and document processes related to partnerships, team rituals, rewards | PM |\n\n### Budget Request\n\n**Season 2 Retroactive Reward**\n\nThe S2 budget request (not ratified - stalled in governance) included a baseline Steward reward plus a reward pool intended to further reward any contributor, including Stewards. Ultimately, the originally defined Stewards accounted for all the hours spent developing the platform and content in S2. To quickly settle up for last season and move forward, the ask is just the original Steward baseline numbers, without the reward pool. 5 months is used here, recognizing that the Season was extended a month by DAO Stewards.\n\nPrevious Stewards: 600 CODE/mo * 5 mos * 7 Stewards =  21,000 total for Season 2\n\n**Q3 & Q4 Budgets**\n\nThe CODE rewards request is a similar model to Season 2, but with fewer Stewards and more weight on a base reward.\n\nStewards: 800 CODE/mo * 3 months * 4 Stewards = 9,600 total per quarter\n\nReward Pool for Contributors: Monthly: 3,200 / Quarterly: 9,600\n\nTotal request of CODE per quarter: 19,200\n\nTotal USDC per quarter, defined by D_D Labs: $1000/mo Sub-DAO Coordination stipend + any preferred partner revenue split\n\nStewards are entrusted to figure out how best to leverage the Reward Pool to advance the mission of Academy. That process will be documented as best practices are identified, but the thought process behind the number is to enable up to four additional “core team” members, rewarded in amounts equal to the Stewards. Any contributor, including Stewards, are eligible for reward pool rewards.\n\nWe commit to transparency of allocations and will maintain those in a publicly accessible location. Further, any reward pool CODE not used will be returned to the DAO Treasury at the conclusion of the quarter or incorporated into the next budget request.\n\n### Business Model\n\nAs a sub-DAO of Developer DAO, Academy will operate as a separate, autonomous organization.\n\nContent will be prioritized for the platform in two ways:\n\n- Internally-driven: the team will assess what it believes to be a well-rounded and high quality user experience, then create tasks to achieve that end.\n- Sponsor-driven: the team will assess opportunities to add partner content to the platform for a one-time and/or ongoing fee, then create tasks to achieve that end. Developer DAO “Preferred Partners” initiatives also fall within this bucket.\n\nThe process for each will be another iterative process that gets documented as they’re refined over time. The team is committed to finding a healthy balance between homegrown and sponsored content, acknowledging that revenue is required to be sustainable, but that over-prioritizing sponsored content may result in a lopsided product.\n\nThe Academy team recognizes that Developer DAO will be a primary source of contributors and learners, while leveraging its brand and reach. Seeking to be robustly regenerative, Developer DAO will retain 19%* of revenue generated by Academy. The remainder will be used to pay expenses, reinvest in the platform, and reward contributors.\n\n_*19 is a “happy prime” number, with nearby options if we want to adjust up or down in the future, e.g., 13, 23. The precedent is 10%._\n\n## Value Proposition\n\n- The team will continue to build an education platform, helping Developer DAO to fulfill one of its core missions: providing free education to web3 builders. Academy is an open source public good, available to learners within and beyond the walls of D_D.\n- As Academy grows, the platform can plug into other areas of the DAO. When users finish a learning objective, they may be encouraged to join a D_D hackathon, become a mentor, write for the blog, apply for a D_D job, and so on.\n- Academy can tastefully promote D_D’s Preferred Partners (e.g., a preferred wallet or data provider) where it makes sense within the content.\n- Finally, Academy will allocate 19% of revenue back to the Developer DAO treasury, recognizing the importance of the DAO as the primary source of contributors and learners, and as a message amplifier via the power of its brand and following.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nThe Academy team would receive 19,200 CODE tokens, the $1000/mo Sub-DAO Coordination stipend, and a share of Preferred Partner revenue over the course of each quarter.",

      "title": "P-32: Academy Sub-DAO Budget - 2023 Q3-Q4",
      "content": "# Academy Sub-DAO - 2023 Q3-Q4\n\nAuthors: @wolovim, @Piablo, @markkos89.eth, @uma\n\n_This is an iteration on the never-ratified [S2 proposal](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-academy-sub-dao/2711)._\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish Academy as a sub-DAO of Developer DAO, based on the current [DAO Governance Structure](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-dao-governance-structure-upgrade/2615).\n\nAcademy is an educational platform for builders, seeking to onboard DAO members and the wider public into both the DAO and the broader web3 industry by providing quality content, support, and a great user experience. An [MVP](https://academy.developerdao.com/) is available and being iterated on today, while a full redesign (”V2”) is also in development.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe Academy team works to fulfill the main mission of Developer DAO: to educate and onboard web3 contributors. What started as a study group grew into a full effort to build a free and high-quality platform to empower builders to make an impact in this industry. The intention is to provide project-based learning tracks that lift developers out of “tutorial hell” and into mid-level skills and beyond. Academy is fully aligned with D_D’s mission to “Accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of web3 builders.”\n\n## Brand Usage\n\nD_D Academy will continue to be hosted as a subdomain on the DAO domain and be closely affiliated with the DAO, while maintaining a separate brand. V2 designs are similar, but not identical to DAO branding. The Academy logo and other components are subject to change as a part of that redesign.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\nThe Academy team is building a free-to-learn education platform. Prior to this budget, an MVP has been designed, developed, and deployed. Since the MVP, new team members have joined and design thinking exercises have been facilitated to explore a roadmap from here. In Q3 and Q4, the focus is on completing the redesign, introducing a couple more learning tracks, and accommodating Preferred Partner initiatives.\n\n## Team\n\nAcademy is to be a sub-DAO of Developer DAO, and as such, intends to operate with a flexible and autonomous structure that allows for experimentation and iteration.\n\n### Structure\n\nAs a team, we task ourselves with delivering and maintaining a robust and meaningful web3 education platform. Together, we have combined decades of professional experience across web development, education & pedagogy, technical writing, product development, and design. Stewards in those core areas:\n\nProduct & Design: uma\nDevelopment: markkos89\nPedagogy & Content: piablo\nPM/Sub-DAO Coordinator: wolovim\n\nThe specifics of how each domain performs its functions will be documented along the way as best practices are discovered. Further, there has been and likely will continue to be significant domain crossover between individuals in these roles.\n\nThese Stewards will be signers on the Academy multisig and the sub-DAO will operate without a separate entity, under The Developer DAO Foundation, abiding by relevant requirements.\n\nThe Sub-DAO Coordinator role is defined in the D_D Labs team budget and - paraphrasing - is responsible for ensuring rewards are processed and the sub-DAO is represented and accountable at appropriate Developer DAO internal and external events.\n\n### Stewards\n\nThe Academy Steward role conveys accountability, not necessarily authority. When a decision in a particular domain needs to be made, it is the responsibility of the Steward to make sure that happens by gathering input, facilitating conversations, and gaining consent from affected parties to move forward with a solution that is “safe enough to try.”\n\nAside from product decisions, the allocation of rewards within a domain is one more decision which should follow a similar consent-driven process driven by the relevant Steward. Acknowledging that this is experimental, Stewards and contributors are expected to document the process as best practices are discovered.\n\n### Contributors\n\nAny member of Developer DAO can join weekly meetings or engage in the Academy Discord channels to learn about opportunities to contribute. The Academy documentation is to be kept up to date with more specific and timely context. \n\n### OKRs\n\n|  | LEARN |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Q3/4 | Provide learners with high-quality learning opportunities | Owner (Steward) |\n| KR | Research and design v2 of the Learner UX | Product/Design |\n| KR | Implement and deploy v2 of the Learner UX | Development |\n| KR | Enable users to store their progress | Development |\n| KR | Optimize the website and lessons for SEO | Product/Design |\n| KR | Publish at least one lesson in three homegrown tracks | Pedagogy/Content |\n| KR | Publish one beta partner lesson | Pedagogy/Content |\n| KR | Facilitate discovery of and document processes related to partnerships, team rituals, rewards | PM |\n\n### Budget Request\n\n**Season 2 Retroactive Reward**\n\nThe S2 budget request (not ratified - stalled in governance) included a baseline Steward reward plus a reward pool intended to further reward any contributor, including Stewards. Ultimately, the originally defined Stewards accounted for all the hours spent developing the platform and content in S2. To quickly settle up for last season and move forward, the ask is just the original Steward baseline numbers, without the reward pool. 5 months is used here, recognizing that the Season was extended a month by DAO Stewards.\n\nPrevious Stewards: 600 CODE/mo * 5 mos * 7 Stewards =  21,000 total for Season 2\n\n**Q3 & Q4 Budgets**\n\nThe CODE rewards request is a similar model to Season 2, but with fewer Stewards and more weight on a base reward.\n\nStewards: 800 CODE/mo * 3 months * 4 Stewards = 9,600 total per quarter\n\nReward Pool for Contributors: Monthly: 3,200 / Quarterly: 9,600\n\nTotal request of CODE per quarter: 19,200\n\nTotal USDC per quarter, defined by D_D Labs: $1000/mo Sub-DAO Coordination stipend + any preferred partner revenue split\n\nStewards are entrusted to figure out how best to leverage the Reward Pool to advance the mission of Academy. That process will be documented as best practices are identified, but the thought process behind the number is to enable up to four additional “core team” members, rewarded in amounts equal to the Stewards. Any contributor, including Stewards, are eligible for reward pool rewards.\n\nWe commit to transparency of allocations and will maintain those in a publicly accessible location. Further, any reward pool CODE not used will be returned to the DAO Treasury at the conclusion of the quarter or incorporated into the next budget request.\n\n### Business Model\n\nAs a sub-DAO of Developer DAO, Academy will operate as a separate, autonomous organization.\n\nContent will be prioritized for the platform in two ways:\n\n- Internally-driven: the team will assess what it believes to be a well-rounded and high quality user experience, then create tasks to achieve that end.\n- Sponsor-driven: the team will assess opportunities to add partner content to the platform for a one-time and/or ongoing fee, then create tasks to achieve that end. Developer DAO “Preferred Partners” initiatives also fall within this bucket.\n\nThe process for each will be another iterative process that gets documented as they’re refined over time. The team is committed to finding a healthy balance between homegrown and sponsored content, acknowledging that revenue is required to be sustainable, but that over-prioritizing sponsored content may result in a lopsided product.\n\nThe Academy team recognizes that Developer DAO will be a primary source of contributors and learners, while leveraging its brand and reach. Seeking to be robustly regenerative, Developer DAO will retain 19%* of revenue generated by Academy. The remainder will be used to pay expenses, reinvest in the platform, and reward contributors.\n\n_*19 is a “happy prime” number, with nearby options if we want to adjust up or down in the future, e.g., 13, 23. The precedent is 10%._\n\n## Value Proposition\n\n- The team will continue to build an education platform, helping Developer DAO to fulfill one of its core missions: providing free education to web3 builders. Academy is an open source public good, available to learners within and beyond the walls of D_D.\n- As Academy grows, the platform can plug into other areas of the DAO. When users finish a learning objective, they may be encouraged to join a D_D hackathon, become a mentor, write for the blog, apply for a D_D job, and so on.\n- Academy can tastefully promote D_D’s Preferred Partners (e.g., a preferred wallet or data provider) where it makes sense within the content.\n- Finally, Academy will allocate 19% of revenue back to the Developer DAO treasury, recognizing the importance of the DAO as the primary source of contributors and learners, and as a message amplifier via the power of its brand and following.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nThe Academy team would receive 21,000 CODE as a retroactive reward for Season2 and 19,200 CODE tokens for Q4, a total of 40,200, the $1000/mo Sub-DAO Coordination stipend, and a share of Preferred Partner revenue over the course of each quarter.",

      "content": "Authors: @Gordo , @Erik_Knobl, @kempsterrrr, @luan, + and others who provided comments and discussions on the subject.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe SubDao model is now a reality. The transition has been already done and with it plus the general decline in the market the community activity and surrounding model of Agency has been in decline. During Season 2 community maintenance was left aside via focusing efforts on the potential legal wrapper of Agency, admin team consolidation and full reorg as a SubDAO.\n\nIt is necessary to retake the community aspect in order to reactivate the resilient side of Agency which is based on people’s activity and willingness to develop high end and interesting ventures and services.\n\nThis proposal seeks to on one side continue works regarding making a reality the business model of Agency and making it work as it should be a capital independent organisation and on the other reactivate the cadence and community based side of Agency which requires constant push and leadership regarding project seeking and people direction and documentation.\n\nIn order to do so and by the brotherhood with D_D and the future value that will be returned into the DAO, keeping alignment with the specific Q3 D_D Labs Budget.\n\nWe seek to develop tight alignment within the Fellowship program and Ventures program, Venture building and High quality Service provider solutions Agency is targeting with. Dispelling and targeting our business model till making it work around those three areas.\n\n## Motivation\n\nConsolidation of Agency is a need, it requires constant leadership, maintainability & support in order to pursue its goals. A clear business model that generates the right economic and social incentives to participate into the Agency model within the D_D value umbrella.\n\nEven though it’s a subDAO it always was intended to work hand by hand with the higher level D_D structure. Those bridges should be clarified, consolidated and worked out in order to secure the future of Agency as “the builder space” inside the DAO.\n\nThe goal of Agency is to ful-fill one of the main areas of the Mission of Developer DAO: To Foster and Build Web3 Tools and Public Goods. We intend to be the space where curated members of the DAO can join to build, in a professional first environment, and create business and ventures. To do so we need to start by providing an economic incentivised relationship group.\n\n## Scope of Work\n### Domain of Operations & Team\n\nStabilise works towards the consolidation of Agency business model sustainability in order to be able to hold new members and create incentive-based work inside the hood of Agency besides venture based projects.\n\nReduce management efforts to the minimum and most efficient possible in order to focus our time into building and providing real value.\n\nReactivation of a rich building/er environment by example. In order to activate an ecosystem like that it is important to focus sight on the incentives of the people which integrate the community.\n\nConstant push venture projects towards an effective business model that drives value to Agency and D_D, even as open source projects their sustainability should be a requirement and working towards economic incentives for the ventures inside the hood should be an opt in.\n\nSimplify the working model. If it is not being used, is out.\n\nThe model looks for sustainability through generating value by doing and automating management as much as possible.\n\nLeadership > Building > Management\n\n## Build up the incentives\n\nThe engine of Agency is leadership on client relationships and venture projects, and the reliability of the contributors. We need to set up incentives for them in order to build up the action energy over the people who want to push its goal and get them rewarded accordingly.\n\n## Structure\n\nConsolidate and reactivate works to continue model pursuing.\n\n## Contact and partnership with D_D\n\nAlign with D_D Labs proposal and partnerships model in order to fund the transition. Promote and specifically reward leader to stabilise contact with the DAO and push the relationships and high-level internal ←→ external activities. @Gordo\nWork side by side with Partnerships and ventures to include them in the Agency business model.\nPolish, consolidate, and build the funnel for new members and actual members’ incentives.\nWork towards Agency business model sustainability.\nDrive returned value to D_D based on previously exposed relationship and tracking direct provided value from D_D\n\n ## Model continuation:\n### Simplicity first, out everything that is not necessary.\nRemove new discord, create more problems than solutions and segment the community. As simple as possible. \n\n### Focus on people, community, and members.\nReactivate people’s conversations and interests all the way.\n### Back to D_D as the source of cultural activity and membership\nCentralise activity on one discord and simplify the as much as possible the flow in every term. \n\n### Focus on building, and automate the rest.\nWork side by side with the D_D builder community in order to create the paths, flows and incentives to be part of Agency (experts) as the builder’s goal.\n\n### Administration\nAdmins work to define the high-level direction and strategy of Agency and its medium-term roadmap. They are tasked with optimising the overall performance and managing the multisig. The current signers are @Gordo, @Erik, @luan\n\nAdmin leader, Gordo, will lead the relationship with D_D as the Sub-DAO Coordinator role and high level org direction and internal while maintaining the overall idea and trust on the organisation.\n\n- Onboarding and curating members\n- Setting the pace and overall direction of the business\n- Weeklies and Open weeklies lead\n- Lead partnership with D_D and comms with Ventures and Fellowship\n\nAdmin Business Developer manager, Manny.\n\n- Co-define overall business direction and work for the sustainability of it.\n- Establish partnerships & relationships with prospective clients.\n\n## Roles in Agency\n- Team Leaders take responsibility for individual projects, and ensure the team delivers, overseeing internal organisation, rewards, and recruitment. They are tasked with managing the overall performance of the team and ask for and distribute assigned $CODE by the works performed.\n- Contributors are Agency builders expected to deliver projects efficiently and coordinate and communicate with the team.\n\n- Sales/BD, trusted external or internal profile delivering potential collaboration inside Agency, paid on success relationships.\n\nTo begin with, we’ll keep the team small so we can move quickly:\n\n- Team Lead: Gordo\n\n- Sales/BD: Mannyornothing\n\n- Contributors: Picked by Gordo for the first project. If Contributors are not available in the pool to fulfil needs on a project, they will be recruited into Agency via the application pool\nContributors\nAny member of Developer DAO can apply to join by filling the initial form. An initial interview will help Agency learn about the skills of the new prospect, and find a role for him/her when the adequate project and/or is available. Current members will vote to grant membership to the applicant.\n\nIn order to be part of Agency potential members will need to:\n\n- Be senior and have reliability on some area of work in web3,\n- Be autonomous\n- Have available time to put into work (min 10 hours a week)\n- Be a team member, no stars, there is no space for stars here.\n- Being a leader is deeply appreciated. Know how to lead and understand the capital requirements of a project, budgeting, client conversations, etc.\n- Be selected by the Admin team\n\nNB - While members can apply, onboarding will initially be slow whilst we focus on proving the model. Please don’t expect a quick reply. As work comes up, we’ll reach out to Contributors who have applied to see if they’re still available.\n\n## Business Model\nAs a subDAO of Developer DAO, Agency will operate as an autonomous startup, connecting talented teams of builders with clients.\n\n### Main tasks of Q3 + (Q4)\nClarify, define and cost the services we provide customers:\n- Web3 Product Design\n- Web3 Front-end development.\n- Smart contract engineering.\n- Create a Pitch Deck and documentation to support this model\n- Work with Labs to reactivate the presence of Agency among D_D and its Members, as well as promote Agency to potential customers.\n- Secure first paid customer for agency\n\nVenture building stays aside till the model is sustainable and as a side effect of the teams providing services. Circling back to approximate ventures as a side effect of service providing and having an internal active senior curated group of people. There is no specific focus on building it but on building the right group of people in which ventures flourish naturally.\n\nOKRs\nThe following are the proposed Objectives and Key Results for Q3 + Q4:\n\n|    | BUILD                                                                                     |\n|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| O  | Validate Agency business model as Service Provider                                        |\n| KR | Reactivate open weekly Agency meetings in Discord                                         |\n| KR | Deliver v1 of DAO Website Resdesign and Development                                       |\n| KR | Successfully engage at least 1 paid partner                                               |\n| KR | Co-work with Labs team to increase status of agency amonst members and potential partners |\n| KR | Co-work with Labs team to ensure success of preferred partnerships                        |\n| KR | Clean out inactive projects and members                                                   |\n\n## Budget Request\n\nAgency intends to be a growing group of builders in the DAO, assembled in different projects, delivering high-quality products and being rewarded for that. We have a base Rewards System 3 1.\n\n### $CODE\n\nWe’re requesting a total of 40,000 $CODE\n\n* Admin pool - 10,000 $CODE\n  * Covers all administrative and coordination activities (meetings, agendas, docs, decks etc.)\n  * Assume admins work 10hrs / week\n* Contributors pool - 30,000 $CODE\n  * Allocation for Team Leaders: Quarter allocation for each project from Agency CODE pool on an agreement with the team leader and based on OKRs of the project leading. The team leader will decide how the CODE is distributed to each team based on work.\n  * Contribution allocation will be organised by each Team Leader based on CODE allocations rulinon each working group.\n  * If the CODE is not used or there are not enough active projects to allocate the CODE based on activity it will be returned or held for the next season. If by the opposite we have not enough code in order to cover the whole set of activities we will ask for more at the end of the season.\n\nWe’re explicitly asking for some flexibility here to experiment with the rewards model in the same way Labs and Academy have in their budget proposals. The goal is to better define how rewards are distributed by dogfooding the process.\n\nDynamic requests not attached to quarterly budgets will be done from the pool by each Team Leader $CODE Pool.\n\n### USDC Allocation from Labs\n\nThe Sub-DAO Coordinator payment in the Labs proposal as well as revenue share from preferred partnerships, will be allocated by the Agency team internally.\n\nWe’re therefore not requesting any further USD-denominated budget in this request.\n\n### Value Return to the DAO\n\n#### Cultural\n\nThe main and most important value the Agency will bring back to D_D is having a high-quality, reliable group of builders. We offer high-quality professional services, curated products that ring our door, ventures that emerge from the D_D hood and require specific people, and the ability to build open products.\n\nThis will be reflected in an increment of the brand value concerning the whole value proposition funnel at the initial stages. We will continue to pursue the concept of: “If it comes from the Agency, it is good.”\n\nShort term, it will allow for higher sponsor agreements with the DAO and stronger relationships with potential future incorporation into the Agency. We aim to attract new individuals with high standards willing to participate in the Agency and the DAO. The long-term goal is to achieve economic stability and then donate a large share of the surplus to the DAO. We will also help the DAO attract a more diverse active membership. With quality measurable outcomes being produced, people who value real value will come to join us, while those who don’t will disperse.\n\n#### Financial\n\nWe recognise the importance of supporting Developer DAO’s financial stability.\n\nTo this end, we propose allocating specific percentages of the Agency’s revenue to the DAO based on the milestones achieved:\n\n10% of the revenue from the Agency’s overall work. We plan to review this model at the end of Q4.\n\nIn return for the value contributed, we expect the Agency to be the first selection as a service provider from within the D_D DAO. Furthermore, the DAO should be the place for active members looking to engage for service provision, channelling the best members of the Developer DAO community into the Agency, ensuring mutual growth and success.\n\nWe expect as well from D_D Labs a side-by-side relationship helping with business development and marketing actions in order to drive high-quality clients into Agency\n\n#### Structural\n\nAgency will position itself as the expert group inside the DAO in which you can trust to build on the verticals we master.",

Introduces a new partnerships model, including preferred revenue share with Sub-DAOs and updated roles and responsibilities in Labs.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal seeks to learn from last quarter and improve what we’re doing in the following ways:\n\n1. Bring the focus squarely back on the community > and partners and provide a consistent experience for Members.\n2. Establish a stable and scalable revenue model.\n3. Directly support the operations and growth of all Sub-DAOs by sharing partnerships revenue and ensuring all Sub-DAOs have the support of Labs in marketing, community engagement & partnerships.\n4. More clearly define roles in Labs, increasing responsibility, accountability, and rewards with a flat rate across roles, with room for more flexible working via bounties.\n\nLast quarter Labs covered Community, Partnerships, Jobs and Operations and proposed some support for website development with Agency.\n\nThis structure has worked OK. It allowed the team to focus and work better together but did not serve or support the other Sub-DAOs. We propose positioning Labs as the “core team” for the team that helps the entire DAO/Sub-DAOs, not just itself, succeed and grow together.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\n### Updated Partnerships Model & Community-Focused Experience\n\nThe Labs team has been working hard to figure out a new model that funds the DAO, allowing us to shift back to a more community-focused > partner-focused experience.\n\n![|602x237](upload://mZWLiKZ4nkBPpiK1ewX8Y0EBUay.png)\n\n#### Preferred Partners\n\nThe foundation for this new model is “Preferred Partners”.\n\nThe goal is to form longer-term partnerships (min 3 months) with trusted providers in the space for tooling/products/services our community needs: RPC, Wallet, Exchange, Infrastructure & Storage.\n\nRather than needing to host one of the events for individual partners, this approach allows us to host community events that elevate the education and impact of our Members whilst recommending preferred partners via CTAs to their services: YouTube/Luma descriptions, Emails, Community Documentation etc.\n\nFor this model to have maximum impact, we’re hoping to extend these partnerships across our Sub-DAOs - i.e. Academy uses the “Preferred RPC” in their course, and Agency uses the “Preferred RPC” in their projects (where possible). We all share in the revenue generated from the partnerships to fund operations and growth.\n\nWe’ve opened conversations with Academy and Agency on these points and aim to find a solution that works well for everyone.\n\n#### Hackathons, vibesIRL, Merch, Jobs and Fellowships\n\nOn top of this ongoing revenue from preferred partners, Labs will drive more revenue from these areas to further grow the DAO treasury and be able to pay more Contributors to help improve the Community experience and grow the DAO Treasury.\n\n[Merch](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0x268cb7e88aa20d7cd9850b5b0ac29c4936bb56706f5c8b36488c78fff78dedc0), [Fellowship](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0x56f858100b12f20d02c1a1606350c74153508791c4d4978aee9c5e93bce2753e) and [vibesIRL](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0xa2d14a277ac14b56a79a0ff3627d4d61dd83ea06034b9801f97512159713910b), were each previously delegated to other teams. Our experience in the last quarter showed us that this separation only made coordination harder for domains that are so core to the Member experience. We’ve agreed with each team to bring this work back into the Labs team whilst we establish and scale this model.\n\n#### Supporting the wider DAO / Other Sub-DAOs\n\nA vital benefit of this updated model is more explicitly supporting other Sub-DAOs. We aim to do this in the following ways.\n\n##### Revenue share from preferred partners\n\nWhere Sub-DAOs are happy to support the preferred partner model, we’ll share 10% of the revenue from each preferred partner. If we hit current targets, this would amount to $2,500/month to both Academy and Agency.\n\n#### Marketing, Partnerships & Community Engagement\n\nThe Labs team would like to work with Academy and Agency to support the work they’re doing directly. At the moment, we hope to see this playing out in the following ways, however, details pending conversations with the team and may evolve:\n\n1. Sub-DAOs have dedicated time/space within existing marketing/community events to promote what they’re doing, seek/funnel contributors etc. (i.e. area on Town Hall, in the newsletter, Twitter Spaces etc.)\n2. The Labs partnership team will promote the services they’re offering to the partners we’re already speaking with (Already discussing lining up paid partners for Academy and can do the same to create more inbound deal flow for Agency)\n\n##### Sub-DAO Coordinator role\n\nWe’ve also budgeted to fund a Sub-DAO Coordinator role for each Sub-DAO, which allocates $1,000 USDC per month to fund someone to handle essential functions of the Sub-DAO: meeting cadence, rewards allocation, and documentation.\n\n#### Community-Driven Experience\n\nThe north star for this new model is an updated experience anchored in providing value for all Members, helping to increase their education and impact in the space.\n\nWe aim to achieve this in the following ways:\n\n##### Regular Cadence of Community Events:\n\nWe’re curating a regular cadence of community events we repeat each month anchored in providing value for Members. Some of the more solid ideas are:\n\n1. Builder sessions: regular slots each week where 1/2 Contributors will be paid to be available to provide help/support to any Member that brings along a technical/product/whatever problem.\n2. Regular, Community-driven Twitter Space Panels: Spaces around topics (for example, zk) where we invite experts in the space to discuss topics the community has signalled an interest in).\n3. VIBES: Contributors paid specifically to host VIBES each week as part of the community team\n\nWe’re also considering a few other things, such as continuing the Wellness sessions with Emm and MVP/Feature demo sessions for Members to get feedback on what they’re building from other members. We’d LOVE to hear some ideas here for regular activities the community would like to see happen.\n\nAt the end of each month, we have a Hackathon, and at the end of the quarter, we run a fellowship program with partners like Press Start Cap x Developer DAO Fellowship.\n\nHere is an image of what the average month might look like under this model:\n\n![|602x320](upload://81NQEKcgad0zpYpGmOcKK1AgkuH.png)\n\nNB - We’re actively seeking feedback from the community on this experience. Please share any thoughts, feedback, wishes, and critiques.\n\n##### CODE Rewards for every activity\n\nCODE has been underutilised in the last quarter. We propose allocating CODE rewards, or rewards pools, to the most community activities that help us achieve our mission.\n\nThe goal here is to “spend” CODE to incentivise and reward the things that make the community grow and more valuable for everyone, similar to how a DeFi protocol might issue yields to attract liquidity and make their protocol more useful for users.\n\nSignificantly, this will also help us recruit more members and further decentralise voting power in the DAO into the hands of Members.\n\nMore specific detail in the budget section below.\n\n### Domain of Operations & Team\n\nThis proposal delegates much of the DAO’s core experience to Labs, establishing them as the core team responsible for: Community Management, Partnerships, Marketing and DAO Growth Operations.\n\nOur experience last quarter has further strengthened the view, at least in our eyes, that we need to increase accountability and responsibility for such fundamental functions and, in turn, reward those performing these roles more reasonably whilst still ensuring we provide flexibility to support a wider pool of contributors and an ability to experiment with the experience being created.\n\n#### Team\n\n|Role|Contributor|Role Description|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Community Lead|BillyJitsu|[Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QF7MauguWBN2MG3tr6BeOJKkMLP2fyOIKNX10gNtfnc/edit?usp=sharing)|\n|Scholarship Lead|iamsamcodes|[Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YcXFpfkpZGpxdLB8O_IoOm8FxRSbFOYxi5JaKW8iZa0/edit?usp=sharing)|\n|Partnerships Lead|mannyornothing|[Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18U8_Ty-YL0qN2JFRsBJ08iw8xFvYRaOHUDlS8Zh0aYM/edit?usp=sharing)|\n|Content Lead|Patrick Skinner|[Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ZPflixxPwEd6H328XzhGeAY_MmTUSk1fS0BK6yAqVc/edit?usp=sharing)|\n|Growth Lead|kempsterrrrr|[Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BSYLuy6qbAnPC4dHSnIZR9npCaYnzRnxICXOq-c0odU/edit?usp=sharing)|\n\nThe folks performing the roles above will be signers on the to-be set-up Labs treasury.\n\n### OKRs\n\n||VIBE||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O1|Foster a fun and safe Member experience|Owner|\n|KR|Consistent cadence of community events|BillyJitsu|\n|KR|Solicit feedback from Members to improve their experience|BillyJitsu|\n|KR|Organise vibesIRL event for Instanbul|kempsterrrr|\n|KR|Release DAO merch store|kempsterrrr|\n\n||LEARN||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O2|Provide DAO members with high-quality learning opportunities|Owner|\n|KR|Weekly learning workshops with Members|BillyJitsu|\n|KR|Monthly Twitter panels with industry experts|Kempsterrrr|\n|KR|2 Builder office hours a week to provide technical support to Member|BillyJitsu|\n\n||BUILD||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O3|Support DAO members to elevate their impact on the world|Owner|\n|KR|1 mini hackathon per month|Manny|\n|KR|1 Fellowship program per quarter|Dropknowledge|\n|KR|Jobs made available for members from 2 Venture Frens portfolios|Dropknowledge|\n\n||GOVERN||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O4|Position the DAO structurally and financially for long-term success|Owner|\n|KR|5,000 USDC added to the treasury each month|Manny|\n|KR|2,500 USDC shared with both Agency and Academy each month|Manny|\n|KR|500 new members with sufficient CODE tokens to acces the server|kempsterrrr|\n|KR|Distribute at least 75% of request Member rewards budget|kempsterrrr|\n\n### Budget Request (Including value returned to the DAO)\n\nThe full breakdown of the lab's budget can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zbWzh0-l0_FAB_M2JWBf2AWKDWnb4yoMxGtQ9D3uDoA/edit?usp=sharing) - in CODE and USDC.\n\n#### USDC\n\nThis budget makes Labs sustainable whilst returning 10% of revenue to the DAO and 10% of preferred partner revenue to both the Agency and Academy to help fund their operations.\n\nWhile this model is being established and we transition back to Sub-DAOs having their SAFE independent of the DAO treasury, we request that funds in the DAO treasury provide the difference to cover contributor and infrastructure/tooling expenses for Labs, Agency and Academy.\n\nThe maximum potential cost assets to the DAO Treasury in USDC is $ 28,399.65/month - for all expenses listed in the budget breakdown [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zbWzh0-l0_FAB_M2JWBf2AWKDWnb4yoMxGtQ9D3uDoA/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThis cost assumes no revenue generated by Labs.\n\nWe aim to reach breakeven in the first month based on ongoing preferred partner conversations and a potential mini-hackathon for July. However, we may not reach breakeven until August.\n\nIf we don’t reach breakeven in July, the request from the treasury would be to cover the difference between revenue - expenses.\n\n#### CODE\n\nOur request for the $CODE budget has two parts.\n\n##### Contributor rewards\n\nMonthly contributor rewards are calculated using the following formula:\n\n(Monthly reward in USDC / Flat hourly rate in USDC) * 15 CODE/hour\n\nThe baseline request for $CODE Contributor Rewards in Labs and for Agenyc, and Academy’s Sub-DAO Coordinators is therefore:\n\n(Monthly Contributor Rewards in CODE / 50) * 15\n\n($ 25,000.00 / 50) * 15 = 7,500 $CODE\n\nGiven there are two roles with a commissions structure - Partnership Lead and Venture Lead - we further request the CODE to cover the CODE rewards should both of these roles hit their full targets.\n\nOn target Partnership Lead commission - $1,500/month\n\nEquivalent CODE reward - (1,500 / 50) * 15 = 450 CODE\n\nOn Target Venture Lead commission - $2,000\n\nEquivalent CODE reward - (2,000 / 50) * 15 = 600 CODE\n\nTotal CODE request per month = 7,500 + 450 + 600 = 8,550 CODE\n\nTotal CODE Request for Q3 Contributors is = 25,650 CODE\n\n##### Member Rewards\n\nIn the same way a DeFi Protocol uses yield to attract liquidity and encourage trading, we’d like to use code to incentivise and reward the activity that creates value for themselves, the DAO and the ecosystem (i.e. attending vibes, workshops, submitting to hackathons etc.).\n\nImportant second-order impacts of this are:\n\n1. Decentralise the DAO faster by allocating more $CODE to Members\n2. Grow DAO membership\n\nBelow is a breakdown of the CODE request to reward Members:\n\n|Activity|CODE Rewards Model|Month CODE Budget|Season CODE Budget (Max)|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|VIBES|15 CODE per NFT Claim (max 50 per NFT)|3,000|12,000|\n|Workshop Attendees|45 CODE per NFT Claim (max 50 per NFT)|4,500|18,000|\n|Hackathon Project Submission|360 per verified submission (3 -hacks, avg 20 subs)|5,400|21,600|\n|Discord Praise System|5000 Bounty Pool Per Month|375|1,500|\n|Twitter Space Giveaway|5 Memberships (400 * 5 * 3)|6,000|24000|\n|DevNTell attendee|15 CODE per attendee Kudos NFT Claim (max 50 per NFT)|3,000|12,000|\n|DevNTell Speaker|400 CODE per speaker Kudos Claim|1,600|6,400|\n|||||\n||||95,500|\n\n*We'd welcome other ideas for activities that should be incentivised and rewarded.*\n\nImportant note - The calculations for Twitter space giveaways are based on the current requirement of 400 CODE to enter the server. Once this proposal is passed, the labs' team would like to open a discussion with the DAO to significantly reduce this threshold and economic barrier for entry into the community.\n\nAny change to this threshold would be reflected in the funds allocated for these giveaways. Assuming the DAO supports reducing down from 400 CODE, the labs team request permission to re-allocate that CODE to test other ways to reward Members.\n\n##### Total CODE\n\nThe total CODE request, therefore, for Q3 is:\n\n25,650 (Contributors) + 95,500 (Members) = 121,150 CODE\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n* There is a reasonable chance there will be a currently unknown USDC cost to the DAO Treasury depending on how quickly Labs can breakeven. That said, it should be low and once breakeven is reached this budget will directly grow the treasury and open up opportunities for the DAO to allocate those funds.\n* This proposal formally establishes Labs as the DAO’s core team with responsibility and accountability for community, marketing, partnerships, content and operations - a high level of trust is requested.\n* This budget does not currently account for Mentorship efforts. However, conversations with Piablo and co are ongoing to define a path where their work can be directly supported and better integrated into the wider Member experience.\n* Some of the roles defined still require further, and likely ongoing, definition, which leaves some uncertainty in the exact value they will create.\n* The CODE request is equivalent to 1% of our treasury.\n* Some conversations regarding how best to coordinate this new model between Sub-DAOs are ongoing which means some details are yet to be defined. Unknowns always present some risk but we know what they are and are actively collaborating with Agency an Academy to define them.\n* Our mechanisms for distributing the $CODE Member rewards are not fully defined after [this news from Mintkudos](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-labs-budget-2023-q3/2769/10?u=kempsterrrr).",

      "content": "Author:`@dropknowledge#0001`\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal suggests initiating Developer DAO’s first Fellowship Program in partnership with Press Start Capital. The partnership aims to provide first checks, mentorship, and camaraderie to aspiring Web3 builders and entrepreneurs to bridge them to top accelerators, downstream investors, and customers.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPress Start Cap 👉🎮🧢 is a pre-seed Web3 fund founded by builders with exits. They invest in the “full stack” of Web3: from infrastructure & dev-tools to game studios to liquid NFTs.\n\nWeb3 is still in its early stages, and the gap between weekend hackathons and accelerators has widened with time. The Press Start Fellowship is an opportunity to seed the next generation of Web3 builders at Developer DAO. The fellowship provides its fellows first checks and a structured program with experienced founders, enabling them to gather feedback and iterate their ideas before they reach accelerators, investors, and customers.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\n### Domain of Operations & Team\n\nDomain: Entrepreneurship, Fundraising\n\nFellowship participants receive\n\n* First check ($15k) using YC’s MFN SAFE and a token side letter. This SAFE only converts to equity if and when the fellow raises a round or joins a future accelerator within 12 months of issuance.\n* Mentorship from builders who’ve walked the walk.\n* Accountability of building and shipping alongside peers in 6 week sprints.\n* Safe space to experiment alongside like-minded Web3 builders.\n* Perks such as company incorporation, priority banking, free merch store, discounted legal, discounted API access, etc\n\nThe fellowship is open to the larger Developer DAO Community, and is not restricted to members. If any non-members are selected for the fellowship, Developer DAO will provide them a sponsorship of 400 $CODE to admit them into the DAO. $CODE allocation covered in Budget Request.\n\nThe Press Start Fellowship team will focus on providing first checks ($10k-$20k) to ambitious Developer DAO members, running day-to-day operations of the Fellowship, bringing in experienced mentors who have walked the walk, and connecting fellows to downstream accelerators/investors. The Developer DAO team will collaborate with Press Start Capital and partner organisations to execute cross-marketing to attract fellowship applicants, assist fellows on PR/marketing, join top accelerators, and raise new fundraising rounds.\n\nThe Team:\n\nDeveloper DAO\n\n @drop_knowledge:\n  1. Has been with Developer DAO since 2021\n  2. Currently one of the DAO's Governance Stewards\n  3. 2x Founder in web3, successfully raised $3M venture funding\n  4. Prior experience working at a startup accelerator\n\nPress Start\n\n**Steven Chien**\n\n  1. Co-founder and GP of Press Start Capital\n  2. DeFi and NFT advisor\n  3. Serial founder with multiple exits; raised $30M+ as a founder\n  4. Co-founder at PRIMA Cinema, Growth & UX lead at DivX, Techstars, United Talent Agency, etc.\n\n**Luke Xie**\n\n  1. Co-founder and GP of Press Start Capital\n  2. NFT advisor\n  3. Founder of MIT Beaver Blockchain group\n  4. Extensive operational experience at McKinsey, Airbnb, Walmart, CODA Automotive, etc.\n### OKRs\n\n||VIBE||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O1|Support and grow the DAO’s community of Entrepreneurs|Owner|\n|KR|Channel for fellowship recipients within Developer DAO’s discord|@drop_knowledge|\n||Developer DAO to provide operational as necessary (e.g. company incorporation support, etc)|@drop_knowledge|\n|KR|Two twitter spaces announcing the program to generate interest|@drop_knowledge, Press Start|\n|KR|Fellowship to be advertised during weekly Dev N Tell interviews, as well as connecting with prior Dev n Tell participants.|@drop_knowledge|\n|KR|Meeting with the D_D Agency team to educate them on Fellowship opportunity and encourage projects to apply for fellowship|@drop_knowledge|\n\n||LEARN||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O2|Provide DAO members the opportunity to learn from successful founders|Owner|\n|KR|Fellowship kickoff intro (30 min), Fellow ice breakers (30 min)|Press Start|\n|KR|Product AMA with speaker (60 min)|Press Start|\n|KR|Growth AMA with speaker (60 min)|Press Start|\n|KR|L1/Technical/etc AMA with speakers (60 min)|Press Start|\n|KR|Demo day practice with Fellows (60 min), Demo day practice with mentors|Press Start|\n|KR|Demo Day (90 min).

      "content": "Author:`@K.#1570`\nSupporting Steward(s): Kempsterrrr.eth\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal seeks to establish $CODE rewards for members who publish articles on the D_D blog.\n\n## Motivation\nMembers are writing articles for the D_D blog, which contributes to the DAO’s mission and goals, so they should be rewarded for their work.\n\n## Scope\nTo be eligible, articles have to satisfy the following criteria:\n\n- MUST be successfully published on the Developer DAO blog\n- MUST be at least 1,000 words long\n- MUST be Web3 or Developer DAO related\n- MUST NOT be AI-generated or plagiarized\n- MUST NOT be cross-posted on other platforms\n\nEach author is only eligible for one article a week.\n\nAuthors of articles that match these criteria are rewarded with 150 $CODE.\n\n## Top 3 Articles of the Month Rewards\nThe three most viewed articles a month are rewarded with:\n\n1. 450 $CODE\n2. 300 $CODE\n3. 150 $CODE\n\nEach article is only eligible for the month it was posted.\n\nAuthors are rewarded in the month following the publication of their eligible articles.\n\n## Retroactive Rewards\nAuthors that already published articles on the Developer DAO blog are retroactively rewarded with 150 $CODE tokens per article that satisfied the criteria from above.\n\nTo claim retroactive rewards, authors\n\n- MUST tell the blog editor which articles they think are eligible\n- MUST claim their retroactive rewards within 60 days after this proposal was approved.\n- The editor MUST verify the articles adhere to the criteria listed above before issues the rewards.\n\n## Value Proposition\nAuthors might submit more articles to the DAO blog, increasing its views. Members that contribute articles to the DAO blog will accumulate more $CODE tokens and, in turn, be more motivated to participate in governance.\n\n##Drawbacks\nThe cost is highly variable.\n\nAt the current rate of 1 to 3 articles per week, we’re talking about:\n\n```\n1 article a week \n150 $CODE \n* 4 weeks a month \n+ top 3 rewards\n= 5,100 $CODE a month\n```\n\n```\n3 articles a week \n* 150 $CODE \n* 4 weeks a month \n+ top 3 rewards \n= 6,300 $CODE a month\n```\n\nThe capacity of the blog would be around 10 articles a week, which could lead to:\n```\n10 articles a week \n* 150 $CODE \n* 4 weeks a month \n+ top 3 rewards \n= 10,500 $CODE\n```",

      "content": "Authors: @kempsterrrr @camiinthisthang @Bobbay @dabit3\nSupporting @stewards - @ntindle\n\nSummary\n\nThis proposal asks Members to grant Cami 1, Bobbay, Nader and kempsterrrr, permission to take ownership of the DAOs VIBES IRL 2 events brand in 2023.\n\nMotivation\n\nIn 2022, VIBES IRL was started by Cami 1 and saw great success as an opportunity for Members to meet each other, engage with the broader ecosystem and improve the DAOs brand worldwide.\n\nThe most successful event alongside DevCon in Amsterdam was widely regarded as the best party of the conference and got devs dancing :exploding_head: .\n\nIn 2023, we want to reinvigorate the VIBES IRL brand and request the DAOs permission to take ownership of the events program for the year with the following aims:\n\nStrengthen and build on DAO brand/awareness\nIncrease the size of the DAOs community on Twitter and Lu.ma\nGenerate funds to grow the treasury and reinvest back into other Member initiatives\nProvide good VIBES (See example 3)\nScope of Work\n\nDomain of Operations & Team\n\nUpon passing this proposal, we’ll assume responsibility for the DAO’s primary IRL events and the associated brand - VIBES IRL 2 - for the remainder of 2023. Finance and Operational associated with the event will run through a UK LTD company @kempsterrrr owns to ensure we can receive and make fiat payments.\n\nWe will organise at least three events in 2023 alongside major conferences starting with ETH CC in Paris 1 this summer.\n\nSpecifically, the work will include:\n\nDefinition of sponsorship packages for VIBES IRL events\nSecuring Partners for each event.\nOrganise and deliver all operations related to the events\nLiaising with other Sub-DAOs to ensure maximum impact from events for all Contributors and Members\nOrganising free merch at events\nProviding retrospectives/reports back to the DAO\nSome rules we commit to following for all VIBES IRL Events:\n\nAttendance will be free for all.\nPOAPs will be issued for everyone who attends events.\nThe Devs will dance\nThe VIBES will be good.\nTeam\n\nName\tMembership Status\tQualifications\nCami 1\tNFT & CODE Holders\tVIBES IRL Founder, Lead DevRel @ Fuel Labs\nKemp\tNFT & CODE Holder\tD_D Ops Lead, P3RKS Founder\nBobbay\tNFT & CODE Holder\tD_D Partner Lead, Governance Lead @ Stablenode\nNader\tNFT & CODE Holder\tD_D Founder, Director or DevRel @ Aave & lens\nOKRs\n\nVIBE\t\nO1\tFoster a fun and safe Member experience\tOwner\nKR\tCurate and deliver >= 3 VIBES IRL Events in 2023\t\nKR\tEnsure a review rating of >= 4 for all events on Lu.ma\t\nKR\tIssue POAPS for attendees of every event\t\nGOVERN\t\nO4\tPosition the DAO structurally and financially for long-term success\tOwner\nKR\tGrow DAO lu.ma subscriber list by >= 500\t\nKR\tGrow DAO Membership by >= 150\t\nBudget Request (Including value returned to the DAO)\n\nWe are not requesting any USD funds from the Treasury. VIBES IRL will be self-sustaining and return 50% of profits from each event to the Treasury. A post-event report shared on the forum will determine profits and be deposited into the Treasury in USDC.\n\nIf there is a loss on the event, there will be no cost to the DAO. To reward the Contributors in elevated Governance rights for the value they’re creating, we request the following:\n\n40 hours X 15 CODE = 600 $CODE\nThat will mean 4 X 600 = 2,400 CODE per event for the core team.\n\nWith three events targeted, that’s 7,200 $CODE in total. We may request further funds via the Stewards if the team grows.\n\nDrawbacks\n\nRestricts organising VIBES IRL Events to these Contributors.",

      "title": "Agency Sub-DAO",
      "content": "Authors: @Erik_Knobl, @Gordo\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish the Agency as a sub-DAO of Developer DAO, based on the proposal [DAO Governance Structure Upgrade](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0x9b84e2300bdcf8d8dde53687c29f71ab9e16ee99feac58734687a2ff10f869ee).\n\nAgency is a collective venture builder curated from the best talent within Developer DAO. By bringing together the best developers, designers and project managers, we aim to collectively build products and services for our clients and the web3 space.\n\n# Motivation\n\nSince the start of Developer DAO, there has been clarity on its Mission: Educate builders, and support their activity. But for almost a year, all building efforts have been done in small individual teams, without coordination. Agency is an effort to support all those efforts, providing tools and support to create a fertile environment for members to build and prosper.\t\n\nThe goal of Agency is to fulfill one of the main areas of the Mission of Developer DAO: To Foster and Build Web3 Tools and Public Goods. We intend to be the space where members of the DAO can join to build, in a professional first environment, and be rewarded for that.\n\n# Scope of Work\n\n### Domain of Operations & Team\n\nAgency intends to become the “Building Layer” of the DAO, bringing together all contributors of the DAO looking to build and develop digital products, offering services such as Consulting, Business Development, Product Management, Product Design, Development and Technical Services for Web3 Products, both for internal use of the DAO, and as a request of external clients.\n\nAgency is a sub-DAO of Developer DAO, and as such, it intends to have a flexible structure, with members able to have different roles and contribute in different ways. All roles will be in constant iteration.\n\n### Structure\n\nAgency intends to attract talented builders to participate in the different projects that it will be constantly developing. The following is a broad description of the roles we envision Agency will have for Season 2, all of them in constant evolution:\n\nRoles based on involvement:\n\n* Admin members work to define, iterate and improve the overall strategy and operations of Agency, and its medium-term roadmap. They are tasked with optimizing the overall performance and managing the multisig. The current signers are @Gordo, @Erik_Knobl and @lu.an.\n* Team Leaders take responsibility for individual projects, and ensure the team delivers, overseeing internal organization, rewards, and recruitment. They are tasked with managing the overall performance of the team.\n* Contributors are builders expected to deliver projects efficiently and coordinate and communicate with the team. The following are the main roles based on skills:\n  * Product Managers\n  * Developers\n  * Product Designers\n\n### Membership\n\nAny member of Developer DAO can apply to join by filling the initial form. An initial interview will help Agency learn about the skills of the new prospect, and find a role for him/her when the adequate project and/or is available. Current members will vote to grant membership to the applicant.\n\n### Business Model\n\nAs a subDAO of Developer DAO, Agency will operate as an autonomous startup, connecting talented teams of builders with clients.\n\nTasks to be done\n\n* Make outreach to different organizations in the space to sell our services, and schedule intro talks with those organizations’ representatives. Measure the sales strategy. Communication with partners and members to ensure deliverables have owners, and the parts of the deal are delivered.\n* Explore possibilities of cooperation between different organizations and D_D directed towards building projects.\n* Make outreach to D_D members who are also founders of their own projects and inform them about the services we provide. Coordinate internal D_D efforts to build tools for the DAO.\n* Coordinate efforts with Onboarding Team to continue the process for members interested in building projects, having interviews with candidates, and recruit members for projects with open spots, while managing the social experience for contributors.\n* Manage the weekly updates of the team to inform the community about the status of different projects. Facilitating internal systems, processes and communications, including updating intro docs like the Agency Notion page.\n* Manage internal databases (clients info, Projects, contributors) for consumption of members of Agency. Manage accounting of Treasury and projects, present monthly reports.\n* Manage external-facing channels (Twitter and blog) active with relevant content.\n\n### OKRs\nThe following are the proposed Objectives and Key Results for Season 2:\n|BUILD OKRs: Support DAO members to elevate their impact on the world|\n| --- | \n|75% of mature projects have a roadmap and operate on schedule.|\n|100% of official contributors receiving their monthly rewards|\n|100% of projects being clear about their current status|\n|Defined governance model|\n|100% of official members have clarity on contributions for the season.|\n|Attract more diverse active DAO membership: 75% of different roles in teams are filled|\n\n# Budget Request\n\nAgency intends to be a growing group of builders in the DAO, assembled in different projects, delivering high quality products and being rewarded for that. We have a base [Rewards System](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DAVQf4RXaf0JO9xZQIelFhWN-1NfFCPONHG_xPZBHB0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThere are two types of requests for the budget: USD and $CODE:\n\nWe request 4,600 USD for Season 2. This will allow us to assemble 4 basic teams for the projects we will have and the operations team (admin). These are symbolic rewards for highly talented members, but will allow us to set the structure for the future.\nEach team will have an average of 5 members, and the total seasonal budget for each team will be USD$1000, a total of $4,000 USD per Season for all 4 teams.\nNOTE: Funding for one of these teams (Website Team) is already included in the Labs proposal.\nAnd the 3 admin members doing operations work will receive a monthly basic reward of USD$100, a total of USD$600 per Season.\n\nWe also would like to request a total of 46,600 $CODE.\n\nThis is the detailed list of all $CODE requirements for Season 2 (feb, march, apr):\n* Allocation for Admin Team (3): Monthly individual: 400 / Total for the Season: 3,600\n* Allocation for Team Leaders (4): Monthly individual: 400 / Total for the Season: 4,800\n* Reward Pool for Contributors (8): Monthly individual: 400 / Total for the Season: 13,200\n* Reward Pool for Bounties: Total for the Season: 25,000\n\nOur current contributor composition is 8. We expect to be able to grow during the Season to at maximum of 20 contributors.\n\nFinally, we expect to have requests of more members interested in joining Agency, and we intend to have a Bounty program that will allow us to test their skills as part of the onboarding process, and reward unique skills we may need during our processes.\n\nWe understand the Budget request is large enough, and therefore, we commit to total transparency of all allocations in a Notion document open to everyone, constantly updated.\n\n# Value return to Developer DAO\n\n### Cultural\n\nThe main and most important value Agency will return to D_D is \"High Quality\":\n\nHigh quality professional services, open products and ventures built by the DAO. This will be reflected in an increment of the brand value regarding the whole value proposition funnel at the initial stages. We will pursue the concept of: \"If it comes from D_D Agency, it is good\".\nShort term, it will allow higher sponsor agreements with the DAO, higher level relationships with the potential of future incorporation to Agency, new people with high standards, willing to participate in Agency and therefore the DAO. Long term, the goal is achieving economic stability, and then donate a large share of the surplus to the DAO.\n\nWe also will help the DAO attract a more diverse active membership. With quality measurable outcomes being produced, the people who value real value, will come to join us. The ones who don’t will disperse.\n\n### Financial\n\nHowever, we understand the need of contributing to make Developer DAO stable financially, so we are proposing returning to the DAO specific percents of the revenue of Agency based on milestones achieved:\n\n* If the Net Treasury* of Agency at the end of any Season exceeds $250,000, Agency will allocate to Developer DAO 2% of that amount.\n* If the amount exceeds $USD 750,000 Agency will increase the allocation percent to 4%.\n* If the amount exceeds $USD 1,000,000 Agency will increase the allocation percent to 8%.\n* If the amount exceeds $USD 5,000,000 Agency will increase the allocation percent to 10%.\n\n*Net treasury = treasury at the end of the season after expenses + taxes and distribution to the contributors, like a profit after taxes.\n\n### Structural\n\nAgency will coordinate all efforts to build tools and public goods for the DAO, starting with the Website and the Store, becoming the hub for developers, designers and PMs looking to deliver quality projects for the DAO. This involves building partnerships with groups like Eden and Jobs to have an updated database of willing contributors.\n\n### Drawbacks\nThe cost of this initiative would be $4,600 USD and 46,600 $CODE tokens from the DAO's Treasury.",

It details the overarching objectives of the team, the proposed methodologies for achieving them, the composition of the core team, and the estimated expenses required for successful implementation.\n\n## Mission, Values & Goal Alignment\n\nSeason 1 of D_D Women was about our journey of exploration and shedding light on the path ahead of us. Along the way, we also came to appreciate the contributions we could make to our community while seeking to gain a deeper understanding of our strengths, and how we can leverage them to make a meaningful impact in the DAO.\n\nAs we move into the second season of our journey, D_D Women will remain dedicated to preserving and strengthening the social layer within the Developer DAO community. However, we also recognize the importance of continuing to evolve and grow as part of the DAO. Therefore, we aim to solidify our unique identity and find our unique voice within the Developer DAO ecosystem.  Through this process, we will remain steadfast in our commitment to fostering an inclusive and supportive environment, where all members are empowered to share their unique perspectives and contributions\n\n## Brand usage\n\nD_D Women will operate as a distinct project within the broader D_D brand, working towards the shared goal of fostering diversity and inclusivity within the web3 ecosystem.\n\n## Scope of Work:\n\nD_D Women wholeheartedly embraces the mission of Developer DAO, to foster an atmosphere of inclusivity, and cultivate a welcoming and secure community within the DAO, as well as within the broader web3 ecosystem. We strive to promote diversity and create a harmonious social environment where all voices can be heard and valued. We also strive to provide a safe and welcoming space for all, where ideas and perspectives can flourish. Our mission is to promote and celebrate the unique contributions of individuals from all backgrounds, and to build a more equitable and inclusive environment in web3.\n\n\n|Name|Discord|Role|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|meowy|meowy#0476|Core Contributor, Team Lead, Community Manager|\n|Krystal|krystal#1337|Core Contributor, Growth Lead|\n|Paloma|Paloma#3073|Core Contributor, Admin|\n|Ella|0xfmoi#2147|Core Contributor|\n\n\n### OKRs\n\nOur prioritized goals for this season include:\n\n* Nurturing and preserving a supportive and inclusive community for individuals who identify as women and non-binary within web3.\n* Holding Social Calls and promoting inclusiveness for the whole DAO\n* Setting up D_D Women Scholarship initiative for the DAO so that people who can’t afford membership can have a chance to get membership in D_D.\n* We will be rebranding (website. stickers, and much more)\n* Nurturing and preserving a supportive and inclusive community for individuals who identify as women and non-binary within web3.\n* Advocating for diversity and inclusivity as the foundation of our mission and initiatives, and working towards creating an equitable and inclusive environment within the web3 ecosystem.\n* Providing additional onboarding resources for new Members, to aid them in finding clarity and understanding within the community.\n* Assisting members in identifying and pursuing opportunities within web3 through networking and social spaces.\n* Establishing a distinct and powerful online presence through the development of our own landing page and maintaining Twitter, which will serve as a reflection of our unique identity and voice within the Developer DAO ecosystem.\n\nGoals we would like to achieve in S2 - but can happen in a later season:\n\n* Completing D_D Women Landing page to create our unique presence. As we are rebranding, so this comes with a lot of responsibilities. Starting to work on our unique landing page is important, but it’s still okay if, towards the end, it goes until next season.\n* Bringing partnerships and partnering with more women and non-binary communities to create opportunities for our members. The partnerships will be done in $CODE rewards. For example, sponsoring membership for completing certain educational cohorts or boot camp/ becoming outreach partners. The other forms of partnership in later seasons can be something of how the DAO partners with seasonal sponsors, and we can try to help with some deliverables if the partnership entails.\n\n||VIBE||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O1|Foster a fun and safe Member experience|Owner|\n|KR|Weekly D_D Fridays Calls|Core Team|\n|KR|Nurturing and preserving a supportive and inclusive community for individuals who identify as women and non-binary within web3 through ongoing support and engagement from the community.|Community|\n|KR|Provide a safe(private) space for marginalized members to openly discuss their struggles navigating through the web3/tech space.|Core Team|\n\n||LEARN||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O2|Provide DAO Members with high-quality learning opportunities|Owner|\n|KR|Minimum of one office hour per month to provide valuable career information, like members sharing their experiences job hunting, interview prep, etc|Core Team|\n\n||BUILD||\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|O3|Support DAO members to elevate their impact on the world|Owner|\n|KR|We will be rebranding(website. stickers and much more)|Core Team|\n|KR|Completing D_D Women Landing page to create our unique presence.

The dynamic and multifaceted nature of our work may require an unpredictable time investment, and as such, the time spent on tasks may vary. However, it is important to recognize that the value of our efforts cannot be quantified solely by the number of hours spent, but rather by the meaningful impact, they have on our mission and community. We wish to shift our perspective on how we measure and value the impact of our efforts. These endeavors, although not always quantifiable in terms of strict hour increments, are of great significance and value. Therefore, our approach is to evaluate and assign value to this work based on its impact and significance, rather than solely on the duration of time spent.\n\nBudget Calculation = 𝒙 hours per-week X 16-week Season X 15 $CODE/ hr\n\nTotal requested budget = 40780 $CODE  + $1100 USD + Tooling Cost ( $23.25 per months) + ($1000 USD per month for community manager)\n\n( 5075 $CODE + $1000 USD + bounty Amount $CODE & USD + any buffer/impromptu costs per-month)\n\n|Role|Candidate|$CODE|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Core Team|meowy|7200| \n|Core Team|krystal|6000|\n|Core Team|paloma|5100|\n|Core Team|ella|2000|\n\n> Community manager : $1000 USD per month.\n\n**Buffer: 6480 $CODE (it’s to help cover any impromptu costs/bounties, and will double over as a contingency)**\n\n## Team Tooling:\n\nAirtable: $12 (monthly)\n\nCanva: $13.25 (monthly)\n\nTotal: $23.25 (monthly)\n\n> 👉 **Note: Even though they are billed per-month, we need to have access to the tooling even after the end of the season/more period of time.**\n\n## Define Bounty Program\n\nIn addition to the primary responsibilities of the core team, members will also be presented with specific strategic objectives, each accompanied by a corresponding reward. These bounties are open to volunteers from across the DAO and can be undertaken at any point during the season. To be eligible for the reward, the task must be completed and submitted for review by another member of the core team before the end of the season. Once approved, the rewards will be distributed.\n\nTotal bounty budget = 14000 $CODE + $1100 USD\n\n|Bounty|Description|Reward|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Designing a website with the latest branding|Designing D_D Women Website with the branding that gives us our unique image.|5000 $CODE +$200 USD|\n|Developing the website|Contributing to the website issues (the issues will be defined as tasks on dework/any other tools to track contribution)|2000 $CODE +$400 USD|\n|Assisting contributors and helping them throughout the season|managing dework/any other tools and tracking contributions while also helping them throughout the process of contribution till the bounty payout|5000 $CODE +$100 USD|\n|Creating team branding(custom logo, banner stickers and emoji)|As we re-brand, we will need more ways to express ourselves and our unique voices.|2000 $CODE +$400 USD|\n\n> Note: We want to ask for the bounty amount upfront so that we can distribute it right after any amount of the bounty is completed. It can be frustrating for members to wait for weeks or months to get paid for their contributions. Some members may leave and never contribute again if they wait too long to get paid. There are times when contributors never get paid, our team aims to advocate for people and pay them for their hard work.\n\nNext Steps\n\nThe immediate course of action is to carefully review the objectives and goals set for each task, and to actively seek out and implement the most effective strategies for achieving them throughout Developer DAO Season 2.\n\n### Contingency:\n\nWhat’s the contingency if 1 or more of these bounty tasks are not completed by the end of Season 2?\n\nWe've two approaches we are thinking of:\n\n* setting a timeline for the tasks to be picked and completed if we have the scope and certain tasks are not completed we will pick them and do some of them but it'll only be after it passes a certain timeline.\n* carrying on the tasks and bounty to the next season if not completed and if out of our scope also.",

      "title": "D_D Labs Sub-DAO Budget - Season 2",
      "content": "Authors: v1: manny, kempsterrrr, Wikist, luan // v2: wolovim\n\n*This is a summarized/truncated version of the complete proposal. See the forum link for comprehensive details.*\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal establishes D_D Labs as a Sub-DAO of Developer DAO. Because this proposal encapsulates much of the core experience and business model of the DAO, no new multisig is proposed and the DAO Stewards will retain governance of this Sub-DAO where appropriate.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs discussed in [Can we build a better game](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/can-we-build-a-better-game/2528/1) and [DAO Governance Structure Upgrade](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-dao-governance-structure-upgrade/2615), the Season 1 DAO structures, both from an operational and a governance perspective, do not serve the majority of members effectively.\n\nThe member experience in S1 funneled all members towards contributing to the DAO on an operational level, though few members had the time and context and few well-rewarded opportunities existed.\n\nD_D Labs seeks to address this fundamental problem in two ways:\n* It presents an updated member experience focused on the overwhelming majority of members who are here to participate casually.\n* It provides DAO contributors with more clearly defined responsibilities and rewards.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\nOn the passing of this proposal, D_D Labs will become an “Operational Layer” of the DAO, bringing together contributors across the DAO who are responsible for the primary business model and the member experience.\n\n### Objective\n\nThe primary objective of D_D Labs is to provide a member experience optimised for the “players\" of our shared game. By that, we mean the vast majority of members who derive value from their membership without directly contributing to the DAO’s operations.\n\nThe updated member experience will focus on one persona: the web3 builder, including all types of folks who contribute to building value in web3: devs, designers, product people, marketers, writers, artists, founders, and so on.\n\nThis aligns with our mission to “accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of web3 builders” and simplifies the experience for everyone.\n\nThis new experience will be anchored to the DAOs [updated OKRs for S2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TjbiCMLqXz3awKlb0vEmJAMowWVBCMv3cA57nNmq4JE/edit?usp=sharing):\n\n|||\n| --- | --- |\n|VIBE|Foster a fun and safe member experience|\n|LEARN|Provide DAO members with high-quality learning opportunities|\n|BUILD|Support DAO members to elevate their impact on the world|\n|GOVERN|Position the DAO structurally and financially for long-term success|\n\n## Domains of Operations, Team and OKRs\n\nThis proposal is broken into constituent teams: Community, Partnerships, D_D Jobs, Agency, and Operations.\n\n*See the forum for each team description and their OKRs.*\n\n### Budget Request\n\nWhile the following items are labeled *fixed costs*, payment is not due if the deliverables are not completed. The intention behind labeling them *fixed costs* is that these tasks are available for completion regardless of the number of Season partners. If, for example, two out of four possible workshops are completed in a given month, then half of the workshop total is due that month.\n\nGiven that partnership and other deliverables were undertaken in good faith from the inception of Season 2, proposal-relevant work completed as of Feb 1 (Season 2 start date) may be billed upon this proposal's passing.\n\n|Monthly Fixed Costs||USD|CODE|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Fulfilment Coordination|Ongoing monthly|$2,000|600|\n|Blog|Ongoing monthly|$500|150|\n|Twitter Spaces|2 per month|$500|150|\n|Newsletter|4 per month|$1,000|300|\n|Podcasts|2 per month|$1,000|300|\n|Workshops|4 per month|$1,000|300|\n|DevNTell|4 per month|$1,000|300|\n|Jobs|Ongoing monthly|$2,000|600|\n|Community|Ongoing monthly|$6,400|1,920|\n|Agency|Ongoing monthly|$1,000|300|\n|Ops|Ongoing monthly|$5,000|1,500|\n|Total Monthly||$21,400|6,420|\n\n\nThe DAO's partnership model rewards some roles based on the number of partners we're engaged with, given that their workload increases with each additional partner. A standard partnership agreement (known as the \"Fren\" package) is $10k USD/mo.\n\n|Variable Costs (per Partner per Month)||CODE|\n|---|---|---|\n|Partner Lead (PL)|10%|300|\n|Fulfilment Coordinator (FC)|10%|300|\n|Partner Blog Bounties|5.5%|165|\n\nGiven these figures, this budget is operating at a profit with three partners. (Break-even point at ~2.87 partners.) Note that this is not D_D's complete financial picture. Not included here is any additional costs requested via other budgets or other potential revenue streams, including from D_D Jobs.\n\n### Legal Status\n\nFor Season 2, D_D Labs is expected to operate within The Developer DAO Foundation. Given that the activities in this budget are core to the DAO’s operations, Labs will operate without its own multisig, and the DAO Stewards will maintain final governance authority.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n* Delegating these responsibilities to specific groups may restrict the number of folks who can contribute to help build the DAO’s member experience compared to a bounty or task-based system.\n* There is no explicit model or process for introducing new contributors to Labs roles. This will be left to the discretion of each team.\n* There are good questions to be asked about which initiatives ultimately belong within D_D Labs, and if this type of grouping is superior to individual budgets or any other paradigm. This concept is experimental and should be rigorously evaluated before it continues into Season 3.\n",

Therefore, this proposal, made by the sitting Stewards, outlines the responsibilities and rewards for Stewards as defined in the [Operating System](https://developerdao.gitbook.io/operating-system/) and invites any member of the DAO to nominate themselves as Stewards.\nNominations of others are encouraged, but only self-nominations will be considered official. This role requires a willingness to participate and push the DAO forward. \n\nDescription of the role as it's currently described in the Operating System: [Stewards](https://developerdao.gitbook.io/operating-system/article-4-governance/section-3-stewards)\n\nNominations were made as comments to the [DDIP Proposal ](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-stewards-election-s2/2657) with the following format:\n\n* Discord Username + Forum Username\n* ETH address (where $CODE tokens are held)\n* Statement of Intention / Your Values & Reasons for Joining\n* Qualifications.\n* Governance Record (link/screenshot of forum stats)\n* Snapshot voting record (link/screenshot of snapshot profile - [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/profile/yourwalletaddress))\n\nThe period for nominations ended Wednesday 22, 23:00 hrs UTC.\n\nAfter the period of nominations, the election will be moved to a Snapshot vote with a [Weighted Voting](https://docs.snapshot.org/proposals/voting-types#weighted-voting) strategy that allows members to allocate a % of their total vote across all nominated Stewards.\n\n* A maximum of 10 Stewards will be elected from this vote.\n* To be elected, Stewards must receive at least 1 vote.\n* If there is a tie between 2 or more Stewards for the 10th place, a repeat vote must be held with only those tied for the 10th place.\n* Nominated members won't be able to vote for themselves. \n\nThe Foundation directors must nominate at least one Steward each Season to provide the required context to the DAO on the legal implications of DDIPs on the Foundation.\n\nThe candidates are (in order of nomination):\n1. ntindle#1998\n2. meowy#0476\n3.

      "content": "Authors: @kempsterrrr @Erik_Knobl @ntindle \n\n*This is a summarized/truncated version of the complete proposal. See the forum link for comprehensive details.*\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal establishes the following:\n\n* Governance Role Definitions, Responsibilities and Rewards: Member, Contributor, Steward\n* Governance Structure: DAO, Foundation, Sub-DAOs\n* Funding Process and accountability mechanisms for Sub-DAOs\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs highlighted and discussed in the forum post “[Can we build a  better game](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/can-we-build-a-better-game/2528/1)”, whilst we have achieved a lot we can be proud of during Season 1, we’ve also realised several challenges with our current model.\n\nTo be successful over the long term and have a serious impact on the Developer DAOs mission, we need the Governance and organisational Structures in place for Contributors to more freely create value for the DAO, its Members and the ecosystem, as well as a more equitable and fair distribution of resources and value.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\n### Governance Roles\n\nSummary: the proposal defines Member, Contributor, and Steward roles.\n\n**Members** are required to hold >= 400 $CODE tokens OR a D4R NFT to access our discord community. This can be changed via DDIP or any authority delegated to a Sub-DAO via DDIP.\n\nVoting power in Governance scales linearly based on the number of $CODE tokens held. For example, someone with 1 $CODE token has 1 vote, and another persona with 100 $CODE tokens has 100 votes.\n\nMembers have no accountability to the DAO beyond adhering to our Code of Conduct.\n\n**Contributors** work for the Developer DAO Foundation or Sub-DAOs (defined below). Sub-DAOs are atomic units in the DAO and have independent processes for hiring and rewarding Contributors, to which Members must adhere to become a Contributor.\n\n**Stewards** are elected Members as well as the nominated Developer DAO Foundation Director who help “Steward” the DAO via elevated responsibilities in Governance. Their objectives, responsibilities, accountability, and election format are specified within the proposal.\n\n### Governance Structure\n\nMembers Govern the DAO via [DDIP](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0x408391614f8d57ee9d8291b70b404506c0f9d0ca7a907e29199d58055e1d7e2c). \n\nThis proposal establishes a new Governance Structure by replacing our existing Budget Application process with a new process for forming Sub-DAOs via DDIP.\n\n#### The Developer DAO Foundation\n\nThe DAO (and therefore its Members) are represented in meatspace by The Developer DAO Foundation, a non-profit entity limited by guarantee with no beneficial owners.\n\nThe Foundation has three directors; one community director (Kemp) and two professional directors from Leeward Management. The directors must enact the Members' will as determined via DDIP and follow this unless they are compelled to violate the Foundation’s Articles, [ByLaws](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/the-developer-dao-foundation/blob/main/foundation-docs/Bylaws%20-%20The%20Developer%20DAO%20Foundation.pdf) or any other laws applicable to the Foundation.\n\nYou can read more about the formation of the Developer DAO Foundation [here](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0x0354fad305c13eae8ba78b2395117b45191465433c20f76efcf3eba4c5600436).\n\n#### Sub-DAOs\n\nA Sub-DAO is an entity or group of Contributors delegated responsibility for a Domain of Operations by Members via DDIP.\n\nSub-DAOs are the atomic units of how Developer DAO advances its mission. As such, ratifying Sub-DAOs sets boundaries on what is and isn’t in the scope of DAO governance. \n\nAny Member may start a Sub-DAO and gather momentum by posting on the forum. Until a formal proposal for a budget is made and accepted, this Sub-DAO is considered “draft”. \n\nA Sub-DAO can be as broad or narrow as its initiators like, but Sub-DAO proposals must satisfy the following criteria or risk being removed by Stewards:\n\n* Have a clear objective that aligns with the Developer DAO’s mission.\n* Distinguish itself from or explicitly state its improvements on any existing Sub-DAO\n* Propose clear budgets and timelines for producing intended outcomes\n* Have a multi-sig setup with at least 3 signers\n\nSub-DAOs can have the following states: Draft, Proposed, Active (Foundation), Active (Own Entity), Renewed, or Archived.\n\nFor comprehensive details on the formation process, \nscope, OKRs, accountability mechanisms and expectations, visit the forum.\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nThis is a far-reaching proposal that makes significant changes to the DAO structure. Whilst a lot of time and energy has been spent debating and discussing the contents of this proposal, it will ultimately be an experiment in coordination to get it right.\n\nThe proposal explicitly seeks to limit the need for DDIP for operational decision-making by delegating specific responsibilities to Stewards and Sub-DAOs.",

      "content": "Authors: @kempsterrrr , @Erik_Knobl\n\n## Summary\n\nThe proposal updates the DDIP process in the following ways:\n\n* Removes the forum vote stage and introduces a new mechanism of qualifying how proposals can be elevated to Snapshot.\n* Further simplifies for DDIP process by removing the “Conversation” stage, allowing the proposal to immediately enter the forum stage, shifting the focus of all Governance conversations more towards the forum.\n* Clarifies the process for how a member joins the allowlist of members who have the ability to elevate the proposal to snapshot (and directs a new conversation to be started on re-considering how the allow list currently works).\n* Lowers the threshold for a member to join the allowlist from 50,000 $CODE to 25,000 $CODE\n* Introduces clarity on how we handle certain edges cases\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal has the following goals:\n\n* Speed up the DDIP process to increase Governance momentum in the DAO\n* Simplify and better document the DDIP process to increase engagement and participation in Governance\n* Clarifying the path through which DAO members can attain permissions to elevate proposals to Snapshot\n* Lowering the threshold for members to join our Governance allowlist\n\n## Scope of Work\n\nBelow is an updated proposal for our DDIP process to achieve the stated motivations above.\n\nYou can find the original DDIP process [here ](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-13-developer-dao-improvement-proposal-formalization/2116).\n\n–\n\n### What is a DDIP?\n\nA Developer DAO Improvement Proposal (DDIP) is a proposal that seeks to enact a change or changes regarding how the DAO is governed.\n\nDDIPs should be limited to the following areas:\n\n* Any decision that impacts the Treasury balance or allocation that is not already accounted for in a previous proposal.\n* Anything that impacts the Governance of the DAO\n* Anything that impacts the “The Developer DAO Foundation\" including it's Articles and ByLaws.\n\nAnything outside of this can be performed freely within pre-determined structures and mechanisms in the DAO.\n\nNote, the Directors and the Supervisor of the Developer DAO Foundation are subject to their fiduciary duty to uphold the Articles and [Bylaws](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/the-developer-dao-foundation/blob/main/foundation-docs/Bylaws%20-%20The%20Developer%20DAO%20Foundation.pdf) of the Foundation and ensure actions remain with the law of the Cayman Islands and they reserver the right to block DDIPs that compel them to act otherwise.\n\nAs per the [bylaws](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/the-developer-dao-foundation/blob/main/foundation-docs/Bylaws%20-%20The%20Developer%20DAO%20Foundation.pdf), the DAO retains the right to change the Articles and [Bylaws](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/the-developer-dao-foundation/blob/main/foundation-docs/Bylaws%20-%20The%20Developer%20DAO%20Foundation.pdf) of the Foundation via DDIP, so long as changes do not fall outside of the laws related to the Foundation that superseded the [Bylaws](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/the-developer-dao-foundation/blob/main/foundation-docs/Bylaws%20-%20The%20Developer%20DAO%20Foundation.pdf). The DAO also retains the right to dissolve the Foundation as its representative entity should it so choose via DDIP.\n\n## Who can create a DDIP?\n\nAny DAO member can submit a DDIP. Only members of our Governance allowlist can elevate forum proposals to Snapshot for a binding off-chain vote by the community. To be eligible for elevation to Snapshot, at least 50% of the existing members of this allowlist must comment on the proposal on the forum.\n\nOnce this threshold has been reached, any one of them can elevate to a vote.\n\nA record of members with this privilege is maintained on Snapshot under “members” [here ](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/about).\n\nOur Governance allow list currently consists of original core team members. Any DAO Member can apply to be added to this list if they hold over 25,000 $CODE tokens.\n\nTo apply, members must submit a DDIP proposal requesting their inclusion detailing how they intend to use the privilege to support the DAO’s mission. Once over 50% of existing allowlist members have commented on their application, any allow list member can elevate their request to Snapshot for a vote locked to existing allowlist members.\n\nExisting allow list members can rescind this privilege at any time. Any member can also submit a DDIP to remove a member of the allowlist, which must follow the process outlined above for including a member with a majority vote of existing allowlist members resulting in one’s removal.\n\n## How does the DDIP process work?\n\nDDIPs must follow the process and format specified below to qualify for our Governance process:\n\n### Discussions\n\nMost governance discussions before a Proposal should take place on the official Developer DAO forum. This is to ensure the community has all the information it needs to make an informed decision about proposals and to provide transparency into what was decided, what was done, and why. Certain discussions, which are often cross-stream governance discussions, would also take place in the weekly DAO Coordination call or at community-wide Town Halls.\n\nDiscussions are not required but strongly recommended, as transparent Governance is essential to a healthy DAO.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAny member can post a DDIP to the forum for debate using [this template](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/updated-proposal-template-for-ddip/1893). The proposal should be posted to the [Proposals forum category](https://forum.developerdao.com/c/proposals/5) with the title “DRAFT - Insert Proposal Name”.\n\nOnce the below requirements are met, any existing member of the Governance allowlist can elevate the proposal to SnapShot for a binding vote.\n\nQuorum Requirement: A minimum of 50% of existing members of the Governance allowlist must comment on the proposal.\n\nTime requirement: A minimum of 120 hours must pass before a proposal can be elevated from the Forum to Snapshot.\n\n### Snapshot Vote\n\nOnly DDIPs that have successfully met the requirements for the Forum discussion can be elevated to Snapshot. Snapshot votes use the same template as the Forum discussion however their title should be updated to “P:NUMBER - Proposal Name” and must include a vote of all DAO members with the following options:\n\n* Yes\n* No\n* Abstain\n\nTo pass, Snapshot votes require needs a simple majority.\n\nAll successful DDIPs must be shared with the Foundation supervisor and directors on the following email address to check for legality before execution and for records to be kept at the Foundation:\n\n* [operations@developerdao.com](mailto:operations@developerdao.com)\n* [developerdao@leewardmanagement.ky](mailto:developerdao@leewardmanagement.ky)\n\nQuorum requirement: A minimum of 2% total circulating $CODE will constitute a quorum.\n\nTime requirement: A minimum of 120 hours (5 days) must pass before a voting decision can be determined.\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n#### Conflicts of interest\n\nMembers are expected to abstain from votes that directly benefit themselves (i.e. voting to pass a budget request that rewards them). Such violations will render votes invalid unless corrected before the Snapshot vote ends.\n\n#### Conflicting proposals\n\nConflicting proposals are proposals that are active at the same time and address the same issue.\n\nIn the case of a conflicting proposal, the 5-day proposal discussion period can also serve as a time for community members to provide their preferred alternative.\n\nIf a conflict still exists at the end of the discussion period, a Snapshot vote will be put forward that includes all the possible options from the conflicting proposals.\n\n### Drawbacks\n\n* Reduces the amount of inherent Sybil resistance in DDIP by removing the forum vote stage.\n* Whilst it clarifies how a member can join the Governance allowlist, this still remains a very small group of people in the DAO.\n* It still does not fully clarify the Steward role in Governance\n",

      "title": "P19: S1 Specification & Budget",
      "content": "Authors: @Erik_Knobl @kempsterrrr @luan @vorcigernix\nView [Forum Vote](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p19-s1-specification-budget/2419)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis is the Developer DAO Season 1 specification. If this proposal passes, the following will apply:\n\n* Season 1 will start on the 22nd of August 2022.\n* CODE token will be launched and the Developer DAO Foundation and its bylaws will be adopted on the same day. (see the associated proposal for Foundation)\n* Season 1 will end on the 22nd of December starting an intentional break that ends on the 31st of December.\n* The Season 1 OKRs will apply, focusing most of the DAO’s efforts on Education, long-term sustainability and improving diverse representation in leadership.\n* Season 1 Budget Applications will be allocated to Guilds, Projects and Operators on a monthly basis.\n\n### What are Seasons?\n\nAs defined in our [Season 0 Proposal](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-3-developer-dao-season-0/219), Seasons are;\n\n> *“A discrete period of time for DAO members to come together to align on projects and initiatives that help us deliver on our mission, values, and goals.”*\n\nDAO-level Objectives for each future Season must be defined upfront by the Stewards, and, prior to starting the next Season, retrospectives must be carried out by all teams to ensure we can learn and improve. These should be reported on the forum.\n\n#### Cycle of Seasons\n\nSeason 1 will be 4 months long followed by a 1-month long Off-Season.\n\nSeason length and cycle will be evaluated during the Season 1 Off-Season retrospectives to determine the next timeframe.\n\n#### Off-Seasons\n\nOff-seasons are designated times for reflection, retrospectives, and if needed, elections of any type. Guilds, Projects, committees or roles that require extra funding for the Off-Season can apply for an extension to the Stewards. A specific budget for incentivising participation in Off-Season activities will be created by the Coordination Operator and Stewards.\n\nOff-Seasons must include:\n\n* Retrospectives: performed on the level of the DAO, each Guild, and/or individual projects\n* Elections: may include positions within the Guilds, Operations Team, multi-sig signers\n* Leadership transitions: ensure smooth ownership transition of tooling, procedures, etc.\n* Prep for next season: e.g. voting on or preparing for the next season’s theme or priorities.\n* Reevaluate reward systems: gauge sentiment on whether rewards were appropriate for the effort last season and make tweaks if necessary\n* Rest: deliberately accomplish nothing, e.g. for a week\n\nGiving these types of organizational health items a separate, dedicated time permits full attention to continue on season objectives while in that season, but also crucially builds healthy habits into the DAO, e.g., giving members a regular break from Discord, properly engaging in the process for regularly rotating leadership.\n\n## Scope of work\n\n### Season 1\n\nSeason 1 will start the day the following conditions are met:\n\n* $CODE token is deployed\n* Foundation Bylaws are adopted by the DAO\n\nThe season will last 4 months from 22nd August to 22nd of December followed by a short break and a 1-month Off-Season between the 1st and 31 of January.\n\nDuring Season 0, our focus was on laying the foundations for the DAO to function. These objectives were defined in our [Season 0 proposal](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-3-developer-dao-season-0/219/1) as:\n\n* Ratify our mission, values, and goals\n* Implement and refine the DAO Structure and improve external and internal onboarding processes for joining the DAO and contributing\n* Implement and refine the Governance process and guidelines for community decision making\n* Research and propose options for DBUCKS (now $CODE) token issue & DAO legal structure (if required)\n* Create space for bigger picture conversations about the DAO and identify Core Projects we want to back as a community through into Season 1\n* Plan Season 1 launch event with partners\n\nWhilst it has taken longer than expected, every member should be proud of us collectively delivering on these goals and laying the foundations for great future impact. It is now time to re-focus on our stated mission: “to accelerate the Education and Impact of a new wave of web3 builders.”\n\nDuring Season 1, our primary focus will be on the first element of that mission: Education. Our secondary focus will be on long-term sustainability so it can have the biggest impact over time.\n\n#### OKRs (Objectives & Key Results)\n\n1. Attract a more diverse active membership\n   * Increase the representation of women, non-binary and other underrepresented groups in leadership positions (Stewards, Guild Leads/Operators, Champions)\n   * Engage 100 more members in South America, Africa, and across the APAC regions.\n   * Create and foster an environment that makes it easier for women, non-binary people, and people from underrepresented groups to participate in the DAO\n\n2. Position the DAO Structurally and Financially for long-term success\n\n   * Form Stewards team with diverse representation and empower them with DAO-level leadership responsibilities.\n   * Secure at least 1 paid project via D_D Agency \n   * Agree on at least 8 revenue generating partnerships\n\n3. Provide members with high-quality learning opportunities\n\n   * Launch School of Code with 1 Project Track and 1 Fundamentals Track\n   * At least 200 people have completed lessons on School of Code\n   * Add at least 5 more lessons to the School of Code\n   * Run at least 16 Educational Workshops\n   * Post at least 16 original educational articles/tutorials to the Developer DAO Blog\n\n*The Stewards may refine or introduce further Key Result trackers during the Season as initiatives evolve quickly and become better understood.*\n\n#### Season 1 Funding Allocations\n\nThe DAO funds Guilds and Projects that members have collectively decided to support via our Budget Application Process (to be reviewed during Season 1 given low participation in voting).\n\nThe final Season 1 Budget Calculations can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RUbEnbxlBt_pAbu-QLjtfKQWKBZZqiqGpHQ20NJTYEw/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nCODE Budgeted = 442,680.00\n\nUSD Budgeted = $112,000.00 (see adjustments below)\n\nThe following adjustments have been made to the requested Budgets:\n\n* Community Guild Operator - paused\n* Design Guild Operator - paused\n* Soil CODE allocation increased due to miss-calculation\n\nFor the paused Operator Roles the current plan is for these to accrue to be paid out at a later date when the Stewards deem the treasury able to afford these rates.\n\nTo receive funding, Guilds and Projects must have completed the Budget Application Process and submit [this form](https://airtable.com/shrZK03EboFhQECTj) once this proposal has passed.\n\nThroughout the Season, Champions and Guild Core Contributors must provide at least a bi-weekly update on the weekly Coordination Call (currently Initiative Leads call) covering:\n\n* Progress against defined Success Metrics & KPIs\n* Any blockers restricting progress\n* CTAs\n\nThey must also provide a monthly update to the forum to support better asynchronous context sharing for folks unable to attend Coordination Calls.\n\nAs defined in the [Stewards](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q73x9QLugWPcPV0Tk13DKAqG1TJyadMxmUnCq2nH7-4/edit#heading=h.1irb7if7338k) draft proposal, Stewards reserve the right to hold back Guild, Project and Operator funding if the above conditions are not met, ultimately deciding via a majority vote of the Stewards.\n\n### Stewards\n\nThe role of the Stewards was initially defined here and is being revised [here](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-stewards/2331).\n\nThis new proposal will delegate power to the Stewards to make certain decisions regarding the treasury and mid-season funding on behalf of members and define mid-term objectives.\n\nGiven these implications, members are urged to take the opportunity to help define these roles.\n\nStewards will be elected members of the DAO.\n\n#### Mid-Season Funding\n\nIt is important Guilds and Projects that require funding do not have to wait for the next Season to apply for it.\n\nTo improve the efficiency of the mid-season application process, the Budget Stewards will be delegated the authority to allocate an amount of CODE and USD expenses to be determined in the Stewards proposal to Projects, Guilds and Operators that request funding.\n\nThe Stewards and Coordination Operator will define the process for mid-season budget and expenses applications.\n\n### Treasury/Finance Infrastructure\n\nAs defined in this proposal, each Guild and Project must have a gnosis multi-sig with at least a ⅔ signer threshold, plus the treasury as a backup signer.\n\nFor Guilds and internal projects, the Treasury will be granted the power to withdraw funds from the treasuries in which it is a signer. For external projects, this will only apply to the $CODE in the treasury. The intention here is a fail-safe to protect against compromised treasuries and bad actors meaning lost $CODE or DAO Funds. See Stewards Vote in discord poll [here](https://discord.com/channels/883478451850473483/915267870924095580/1004759913941192814).\n\n#### Finance Stack and Tracking\n\nAs mentioned above, all multi-sigs must be Gnosis safes.\n\nFor Season 1, the Coordination Operator in partnership with Anubhav and our friends at Parcel will deploy safes on behalf of Guilds and projects across Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, Optimisims and Aribitrum, with the correct configuration.\n\nThe [Parcel](https://parcel.money/) team has been helping us set up the infrastructure required to make the challenge of managing treasuries at the individual at DAO level far easier and will be the tool we use for this for Season 1. Guides on how to use them will be ready for the start of the Season.\n\nUsing Parcel provides us multiple benefits:\n\n* Automated transparent tracking of finances across the DAO including categorisation of transactions for better transparency, auditing and compliance.\n* Built-in Budget and Expense request flow, including milestones. This Functionality can be delegated to non-signers (i.e. Stewards)\n* Gas-free transactions are sponsored by our Friends at Parcel\n\n## Drawbacks\n\n* CODE leaving the treasury\n* USD affecting the sustainability of the treasury\n\n## Next Steps\n\nUpon passing of this proposal & the $CODE deployment, Governance will switch from the NFT to the new ERC20 token, budgets will be issued to Guilds and Projects, and Season 1 will officially start.\n\n## Vote\n\n**For** - Ratify this proposal\n**Against** - Do not ratify this proposal\n**Abstain** - Abstain from this vote",

      "title": "P-18: The Developer DAO Foundation",
      "content": "Author: kempsterrrr\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal outlines the structure, purpose and implications of The Developer DAO Foundation (the “Foundation”) on Developer DAO and, therefore members.\n\nOn passing this proposal, the following will apply:\n\n* Developer DAO approves the Foundation as a legal entity to represent DAO, and its [Bylaws](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/the-developer-dao-foundation/blob/main/foundation-docs/Bylaws%20-%20The%20Developer%20DAO%20Foundation.pdf).\n* The DAO Treasury and its assets are transferred to the Foundation.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Why have a legal entity?\n\nBorrowing from our friends at ENS DAO, having a legal entity representing the DAO in the “real world” is valuable for several reasons:\n\n* It provides limited liability to DAO participants for the actions of the DAO. Without a legal entity, participants may be individually held liable for anything the DAO as a whole does.\n* It is capable of complying with taxation requirements. Without a legal entity, DAO participants may be held liable for a proportion of the DAO’s income, even if they cannot access these funds.\n* It can enter into contracts with other “real world” entities, holding assets, etc.\n\nCheck out this excellent [blog post](https://mirror.xyz/0x954888B7a5C6736F4955dF18B556D8328FD02f61/5K9llACK4tzu5WHL68CM3bBsmSleL_XxJ2kRGYnwp7A) for a more detailed discussion.\n\n## Mission, values & goals alignment\n\nSuccessfully delivering on our mission to “accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of web3 builders” requires interfacing with the real world. A Cayman Foundation not only provides us with an entity, but its structure supports the diverse and global nature of our membership, the philanthropic spirit of our mission via tax neutrality and the added peace of mind of defined regulation related to crypto tokens within which we can operate.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\n### What is The Developer DAO Foundation\n\nThe Developer DAO Foundation is a Foundation Company Limited By Guarantee with No Share Capital, incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Such Foundations are suitable for non-profit entities like ours as they can exist with no equity-like owners and instead be structured in such a way as to follow the will of a wider group of stakeholders. In our case, the DAO and its Governance Tokenholders.\n\nThe Developer DAO Foundation initially has three Directors: me (kemp) and two Cayman-resident professional directors who perform similar roles for many other well-known, established DAOs. This majority Cayman director structure is key to ensuring the Foundation maintains residency in the Cayman Islands.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for overseeing the day-to-day management of the Foundation and for certain executive functions. For example, implementing changes required by successful DDIPs, signing contracts, and interfacing with real-world entities such as legal counsel that represent the Foundation or financial services providers.\n\nAnything outside of such operational tasks and strategic matters requires DAO approval through Governance.\n\nFoundations also legally require a Supervisor. The Supervisor is an administrative position with reserve powers akin to a shareholder of a company. The Supervisor is one of the Cayman-resident professional directors who also performs this role for other DAOs.\n\nYou can find the Certificate of Incorporation for the Foundation on our Github [here](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/the-developer-dao-foundation/blob/main/foundation-docs/Certificate%20of%20Incorporation%20-%20The%20Developer%20DAO%20Foundation.pdf) and an article that explains why this structure is appropriate [here](https://www.conyers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-CAY-Article-A-Strong-Foundation-for-Philanthropy.pdf).\n\nOur legal structure may evolve, including creating more entities to support various needs. For example, accepting and making fiat payments, registering IP for Developer DAO, and supporting initiatives that are not core to the DAO but need financial and legal infrastructure to operate. With help from the Fundraising Operators and Stewards, I will drive this on advice from counsel and tax advisors in the coming weeks and months and will keep the DAO up to speed with any changes.\n\n### What are the implications for the DAO?\n\nThe assets currently held by the DAO will be held by the Foundation.\n\nThis sounds like a scary sentence, but the Foundation exists to enact the will of the DAO or its tokenholders. Exactly how this works is more clearly defined in the Foundation’s Memorandum and Articles of Association and Bylaws.\n\nThe Foundation, and therefore its directors, must follow the will of the DAO unless it could cause harm to the Foundation or if that puts them in breach of (i) their fiduciary duties under Cayman law, (ii) the Memorandum and Articles of Association including the “Objects” of the Foundation (its intended purpose[s]), (iii) any laws that apply to it, or (iv) any agreements or arrangements entered into by the Foundation.\n\nThe “Objects” for the Foundation are defined as follows:\n\n* the education of participants in the web3 and blockchain-related ecosystem;\n* the open-source development and adoption of technologies and software;\n* to provide ongoing research and education concerning decentralised autonomous organisations, open-source software, novel funding mechanisms, coordination tools, practices and protocols, blockchain or distributed ledger technology;\n* to enter into any private use modes or commercial agreements or relationships in furtherance of any of the above; and\n* to do all such things as in the opinion of the directors are or may be incidental or conducive to the above objects or any of them.\n\n\nThe Objects are designed to reflect the DAO’s stated mission, thus limiting the Foundation to that mission. However, they are intentionally broad to ensure the Foundation can legally enact any DAO decisions via DDIP without breaching them. The language is different from the DAOs stated mission; that language isn’t sufficient for a legal document.\n\nThe DAO can change everything about the Foundation, including its Directors, Articles, Objects and Bylaws, via a successful [DDIP](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0x73c769ff86254ff7cd753d85c5ce3e901dd27727cc22e8c62349aba34739c3c6).\n\n### What are the implications for members of Developer DAO?\n\nThe Foundation is a significant milestone for the DAO. The benefit of being able to enter into contracts, accept money and limit liability for members can’t be understated. We’re now able to move forward on all Season 1 initiatives.\n\nExisting internal processes will remain the same regarding how the DAO makes decisions and who signs the treasury transactions. Responsibility for signing on the Treasury is being delegated by the Foundation’s Directors to the current signatories.\n\nWe will add some extra lightweight processes to ensure the Foundation can maintain compliance with regulations, including Anit-Money Laundering (AML) laws.\n\nExamples include:\n\n* Accounts Receivable and Payable processes for money entering and leaving the Foundation treasury.\n* A Grant Agreement for contributors receiving ongoing fiat denominated payment for services provided to the Foundation, mainly applying to DAO Operators and Partnerships Leads currently.\n* Contracts for any partnerships the Foundation enters into or Services it provides. These will be signed by the Foundation Supervisor.\n* Pre-emptive AML regulatory filings for any in-bound grants received by the Foundation.\n* Successful DDIPs must be shared with the Foundation Directors and Supervisors.\n\nAs mentioned above, one of the core motivations for having a legal entity is to provide some limitation of liability for contributors to the DAO. There is, however, no perfect legal structure. DAOs are a new concept and how they are regulated varies significantly across jurisdictions. We are, however, confident this approach will provide much better protection for our community.\n\n## Financial Implications\n\n|Item|Amount|\n| --- | --- |\n|Off-shore legal counsel|$37,348.75|\n|On-shore Legal Counsel|$10,000.00|\n|Supervisor, Registered office, Cayman Directors and regulatory filings|$19,173.38|\n|Accounting|$5,000.00|\n||*$71,522.13*|\n\nThe Bylaws define a yearly operating budget of $50,000 to cover fixed operating costs (Cayman Islands government fees, registered office and secretary/director/supervisor fees) and leave room for some ad hoc legal and operational costs the Foundation may incur.\n\nFurther costs will require DAO approval through Governance.\n\n*Significant thanks must go to the web3con team for making this possible. Without the funds they brought in from the conference this may not have been possible. A discussion will be opened with the team regarding what to do with the remaining funds when this is clear.*\n\n## Drawbacks\n\nThe cost incurred with forming and running the Foundation as described above.\n\n## Vote\n\nFor - Ratify this proposal\nAgainst - Do not ratify this proposal\nAbstain - Abstain from this vote",

      "title": "P-16: Ratify the Early Contributor Allocations of $CODE",
      "content": "**Author:** willblackburn.eth, Coordinape Working Team\nView the [Forum Vote thread](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-16-ratify-the-early-contributor-allocations-of-code).\n\n## Summary\n\nMany DAO members have been core early contributors to the DAO without the expectation of reward. The $CODE issuance will set a percentage of tokens aside for early contributors. We held a Coordinape circle to distribute these tokens. Founding Team members & advisors are not be eligible for Early Contributor rewards.\n\nThe epoch for the Early Contributors circle ran for 10 days from March 7 to March 17th 2022. The circle ended with 305 total members receiving GIVE.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAs discussed in Town Halls, Governance meetings, and discord, a strategy is to be applied to the raw results of the Coordinape epoch to align the results with the ratified purpose of the Early Contributor rewards.\n\n## Overview of Strategy for Final Distribution\n\nThe following strategy was applied to the raw Coordinape results.\n\n1. First, any GIVE send above 10 was **capped to 10**. For example - if Alice sent Bob 15 GIVE, Bob only receives 10 GIVE. If Bob sent Alice 9 GIVE, Alice receives the entire 9 GIVE.\n\n    1. This widens the distribution of the Coordinape epoch and guards against members giving all of their GIVE to one recipient.\n\n2. Second, early core contributors are verified by contribution leaders in the DAO. You can read more about this process and see the verification results [on our wiki](https://developerdao.notion.site/85f6ebe5393a43d9aabd682c269bd8f9?v=90f747eca99e4a66afca60f5b7ff19d5). \n\n    1. Many of the unverified members participated in the community, but did not meet the threshold of a verified early core contributor. Read below to see that unverified contributors are not excluded from early contributor rewards.\n  \n3. Third, a GIVE cap is placed on **unverified contributors**. The GIVE cap was decided as 10 GIVE.\n  \n    1. This equates to 602 \\$CODE. This more than doubles an active members initial \\$CODE claim if they just held the NFT at snapshot, while keeping the distribution below that of many verified contributors who contributed significantly more time.\n    \n   2. Because the cap is performed at the GIVE level, the \\$CODE is redistributed to verified contributors (since \\$CODE is distributed as a percentage of GIVE held for the epoch).\n    \n4. Fourth and finally, a \\$CODE cap is placed on **verified contributors**. The \\$CODE cap was decided as 40,000 $CODE.\n  \n   1. This cap applies to only 3 contributors.\n    \n    2. This cap is applied to ensure the allocation fits within the broader tokenomics of Developer DAO. ([P-5: Governance Token Proposal](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-5-governance-token-proposal/1070), [P-10: Governance Token Allocation Amendment for Founding Team &amp; Advisors](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-10-governance-token-allocation-amendment-for-founding-team-advisors/1830))\n    \n    3. The extra code (~12,743 $CODE) will be reclaimed by the treasury.\n    \n\nYou can view data, including [final allocations](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/member-and-early-contributor-rewards/blob/main/2%20-%20Early%20Contributors/final_early_contributor_amounts.json), in the [Developer-DAO/member-and-early-contributor-rewards repo](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/member-and-early-contributor-rewards).\n\n## Vesting of Early Contributor Allocations\n\nAny \\$CODE amount above 20,000 \\$CODE will be subject to vesting. The vesting applied will be the same vesting applied to the Founding Team & Advisors allocations. Just as with the Founding Team & Advisors, this is to slow the accumulation of \\$CODE into single hands. **8 early contributors** will have \\$CODE vesting applied to the amount of \\$CODE from their allocation that is greater than 20,000 \\$CODE. For example, if Alice was to receive 25,000 \\$CODE, they would be able to claim 20,000 at launch of claiming with 5,000 subject to vesting.\n\nVesting will occur monthly for 24 months (2 years) in the form of claimable \\$CODE tokens via a separate vesting contract that is in development. If \\$CODE is launched before the vesting contract is completed and audited, \\$CODE subject to vesting will be held in the Treasury until transferred to a vesting contract.\n\n## Vote\n**For** - Ratify the Early Contributor Allocations of $CODE\n**Against** - Do not ratify the Early Contributor Allocations of $CODE\n**Abstain** - Abstain from the vote",

      "title": "P-17: Reward Contributions in $CODE",
      "content": "Authors: @kempsterrrr @Erik_Knobl @willblackburn \nView the [Forum Vote](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-17-reward-contributions-in-code)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to provide clarity on how contributions in Developer DAO are rewarded in our non-financial Governance token, $CODE.\n\nThis proposal has the following objectives:\n\n* Get $CODE flowing into the hands of contributors\n* Simple system for calculating budgets which will ensure proposals to secure funding do not get blocked by significant debate around allocations\n* Flexibility for experimentation on the DAO Org Structure and Rewards mechanisms at the Guild and Project level.\n\nThe aim here is a “good enough” framework we can iterate on and improve as the DAO matures. It is NOT intended to be perfect or permanent.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSince the start of Developer DAO in September, many contributors have been pouring their time into helping move the DAO forward without any clarity on how they will be rewarded for this.\n\nAddressing this is key to ensuring a healthy community for the long-term.\n\nBy rewarding contributions in our Governance token, $CODE, we can ensure the people contributing most to the success of the DAO are also the people with the biggest say in Governance decisions via their $CODE vote.\n\nWhilst this will not help to pay people’s rent, it will help reward actions and incentivize activities that can result in meaningful meatspace funds i.e. projects receiving grants funding or generating revenue that is distributed between contributors and the treasury.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Flow of $CODE to Contributors\n\nIn the pursuit of simplicity for Season 1, this proposal suggests that all contributions across the DAO share the same largely trust based process for rewarding contributions:\n\n* An agreed flat hourly rate denominated in $CODE to serve as the basis for calculating budgets across the DAO.\n* Guilds and Projects define their own budgets. Contributors estimate their own hours. For bounties, time to complete is estimated and then multiplied by hourly rate in $CODE.\n* Projects that are expected to drive revenue will suggest a % split of revenue between contributors and the DAO Treasury to be included in their Budget Application and therefore discussed/voted on by DAO Members.\n\n### Budget Calculations & $CODE Hourly Rate\n\n$CODE Budget and Reward Calcultions\n\nIn our Governance Token Proposal, 50% of $CODE allocation goes to the Community Treasury.\n\nThat’s 5,000,000 CODE.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating $CODE budgets, this proposal assumes the following:\n\n* 4 Year linear vesting of available $CODE\n* Seasonal length of 4 months\n\nThis means that each Season there will be 416,666.67 CODE available to be allocated to Guilds, Projects and other initiatives. For the purpose of calculating a suitable initial hourly rate in $CODE, this proposal assumes the following:\n\n* 100 active contributors\n* Average 10 hour weekly contribution\n\nBased on calculations for in the attached spreadsheet, this extrapolates out to a suitable hourly rate of 15 $CODE which totals 240,000 $CODE per Season, or 2,400 $CODE for the “average” conributor. This is well inside the 416,666.67 $CODE budget thus leaving room for other initiatives (Gifting memberships, potential token swaps etc.).\n\nThe 2,400 $CODE seasonal rewards could be much larger for people who were contributing more. This is a good thing as it further decentralizes Governance power into the hands of people contributing the most.\n\nGuilds can include Projects/initiatives run by the Guild in their budget or they can apply for a budget separately as a Project. Each can have a mixture of “salaried” roles and bounty pools, or only one or the other. It is up to the team how to approach this but budgets must be calculated using the hourly rate.\n\nA worked example:\n\n#### Design Guild\n\nThe Design Guild may choose to have some “salaried” roles for ensuring Guild functions correctly. The formula to calculate the budget for each role would be:\n\n`Estimated hours per week X Weeks in Season X Hourly CODE rate`\n\nThey may also want to offer bounties for creating POAPs. The formula for calculating this budget would be:\n\n`Estimated number of POAPs X Estimated hour(s) to produce one X Hourly rate`\n\nHowever Guilds or Project decide to calculate and allocate their budgets is up to them.\n\nExperimenting with DAO Tooling such as [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/), [DeWork ](https://dework.xyz/) and [Wonderverse](https://www.wonderverse.xyz/) is encouraged to find what works best for each group.\n\nIt is recommended that rewards are sent to contributors on a monthly basis (at most) so as to reduce gas fees. The Operations team will provide a spreadsheet for tracking transactions before the start of Season 1.\n\n### Budget Application Process\n\nExisting Guilds and Projects can skip to Phase 2, new ones must start at Phase 1\n\n### Phase 1 - Conversations and Brainstorming\n\n* Post to discord: share your idea in a relevant discord channel to get feedback and have it out in more detail. If you’re unsure of the correct channel use #brainstorming\n* Generate Consensus, form a team: gain support for the idea from at least 5 other DAO members who are committed to scoping out and delivering the idea. Remember, your proposal will need to be voted on by the community so their support is important for the budget to be approved.\n\n### Phase 2 - Form a Team and Draft Budget Application\n\n* Form a team: get commit for at least 5 other people who want to be actively involved in the Guild / Project\n* Create a draft proposal: use this [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MIXRJShHLuthoPGyzogAZJgZik1kDnceViBQdRlDxqM/edit?usp=sharing) to create a draft Budget Proposal and share on the forum for Feedback for at least X days\n* Gain support of a Budget Steward: for S1, a Budget Stewards Committee is being created. The committee’s first members are the guild leaders and the top 5 verified members from our early contributor rewards round, chosen by DAO members. A Budget Steward role will be created on discord and discourse to identify these people. Budget Stewards cannot support their own project.\n\n### Phase 3 - Forum Vote\n\n* Add a vote to the Budget Application post on discourse\n* If at least 100 people vote and there is at least 66% in support of the proposal then submit your successful budget application via [this form ](https://airtable.com/shrZK03EboFhQECTj).\n\nThere are specific requirements for submitting Budget Applications:\n\n* Projects must have at least one Champion to serve as the primary point of contact for the rest of the DAO including the budget application. Guilds must also identify who plays this role in their structure.\n* Projects must have a discord channel where DAO members can join the conversation. New proposed Guilds should provide an overview of the Category to be created.\n* Projects must have a Project Page in the Developer DAO Notion Projects table, Guilds a Page in the Guild section on the Notion Home Page.\n* A multisig setup with at least 3 signers, budgets will be sent to this address.\n\n–\n\nThe Operations Team will act as processor of Budget Applications and allocate funds to Guild/Project multi-sigs during Season 1. This may sound like centralisation and a single point of failure however the purpose is solely to enact the will of the DAO based on the Budget Application Process.\n\n* Example budget application for B3NZ - [[DRAFT 1] - Example $CODE Budget Application ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7s899-s-F3XaiTwyrtCsTrJasrapjt0Bcrm9cHhpQo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n### Budget Distribution, Accountability and Visibility\n\nBudgets will be distributed on a monthly basis by the Operations Team.\n\nTo help DAO members maintain some visibility of project progress and also to ensure some level of accountability during Season 1, Guilds and Projects must submit a bi-weekly update to the forum to receive the next month’s allocation.\n\nNo updates, No $CODE.\n\nIf an update is submitted and the Operations Team have any reason to question whether or not the next month’s budget should be issued, they will refer this to the Budget Stewards to Vote on allocating/not-allocating the next month’s budget. This vote will be carried out in public via a sesh bot poll restricted to people who hold the Budget Stewards discord role.\n\nThis process will be improved during Season 1 as we figure out better ways of coordinating work and sharing updates across the DAO. Ideally the Budget Stewards is either and elected committee or it is tied to a threshold of $CODE holdings, then delegated power by the DAO to make these decisions on behalf of members.\n\n## Benefits\n\nSee “motivations” section above\n\n## Drawbacks/Acknowledgements\n\nIn the pursuit of simplicity and forward momentum, a few compromises have been made and should be acknowledged:\n\n* Valuing all work across the DAO equal in terms of reward in elevated Governance via $CODE allocation. This is imperfect as the value generated on hourly contributions is not flat and is something we should explore in more detail during S1.\n* Trust-based system for rewards rather than explicitly outcome-based system. We’re relying on social constructs to ensure lots of $CODE isn’t wasted and it is unclear how well this will work in practice but massively simplifies getting $CODE into the hands of contributors.\n* All rewards being in $CODE does not directly help people pay their bills. It is hoped the incentivisation of action by rewarding in $CODE will drive initiatives that generate grant funding or revenue which is then distributed to contributors who brought in that funding/revenue on their project.\n* These calculations cannot be perfect and there is a reasonable chance we could go over the budget for Season 1\n\n## Vote\n**For** - Ratify this proposal\n**Against** - Do not ratify this proposal\n**Abstain** - Abstain from this vote",

      "title": "P-13: Developer DAO Improvement Proposal Formalization",
      "content": "# Developer DAO Improvement Proposal Formalization\n**Authors:** tonyolendo, willblackburn.eth\nSee the Forum Vote [here](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-13-developer-dao-improvement-proposal-formalization/2116).\n\n# Summary\n\nThe below proposal serves as a meta-proposal to define the Governance process after the deployment of our $CODE governance token. The proposal rules & guidelines defined will go into effect at the launch of the $CODE token.\n\n# What is a DDIP?\n\nA Developer DAO Improvement Proposal (DDIP) is a proposal that seeks to enact a change or changes regarding how the DAO is governed. DDIPs should be limited to the following areas:\n\n- Any decision that impacts the **Treasury** balance or allocation.\n- **Founding Team** and **Guild Leader** appointments, removals, remuneration, and process changes.\n- **Advisor** relationships and compensation.\n- True **Partnerships** with other DAO, Protocols, Investors, etc. *Sponsorships* do not require a DDIP and are handled by the Marketing Guild.\n- Anything that impacts \"The Foundation\" - referring to the foundation being setup to help the DAO operate.\n- Any other item that affects DAO governance in a material way such as Season specifications, operational working groups outside of the Guild structure defined, etc.\n\nFor example, a DDIP is not required for:\n\n- Guild-related proposals that do not meet the above criteria.\n- Cross-guild decisions that do not impact the treasury.\n\n## Who can create a DDIP?\n\nWhile anyone can complete the first steps below to begin a discussion around a proposal, there are requirements for the Forum and Snapshot vote phases. Our explicit intention is to continue to remove controls around the proposal process. Proposal procedures are at risk for various governance attacks. As we mature our governance mechanisms, we can continue removing controls and decentralizing further.\n\nFor a proposal to move to the Forum and Snapshot vote phases, it must be championed by a DAO member with a minimum of **50,000 $CODE** who has been allow-listed for Governance procedures. The passing of this process allow-lists the Founding Team members for the Governance process. The governance approved allow-list will be actively maintained and visible on our Wiki.\n\nWe hope that by the end of Season 1, we can reduce the controls on this process as we get accurate information about items such as *active governing power (percentage of $CODE that is voting in proposals), $CODE liquidity, supermajority refinement, and more*. A DAO member who accumulates 50,000 $CODE can trigger a governance allow-list vote without the need for a champion.\n\n# What is the DDIP process?\n\nDDIPs must follow the process and format specified below to qualify for our governance process.\n\n## Phase 1: Conversations\n\nThe starting point of any proposal is a conversation. Discussion of a DDIP should take place on Discord, where members can provide opinions on the impact of the DDIP. There should be clear, observable agreement on an item before entering the next phase. Phase 1 can be further broken down into the following stages.\n\n- **Post in Discord**. Start the conversation in the relevant channel. This can be a guild channel where the proposal most closely aligns, the `#general` channel, or any place where people can discuss and share their thoughts on the idea. Work with guild leaders and moderators to ensure the discoverability of the topic and discussion.\n- **Generate Consensus**: At least 5 other members should come alongside the proposer to show their support for the proposal. The duration for this is open-ended. The specific means of showing support need not be too prescriptive; the conversation flow should simply show that there are other people who think this is a good idea.\n- **Support and Champion**: Once a proposal has been sufficiently discussed and there is clear, demonstrable support for the DDIP and the DDIP has received the nod of at least 5 backers and an allow-listed governance Champion, it can enter Phase 2.\n- If needed, Champions can be found by notifying the `Moderator` role in Discord.\n\n## Phase 2: Brainstorming and DDIP Development\n\nOnce an idea has received support, it must be documented in **DRAFT** form using the template [here](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/updated-proposal-template-for-ddip/1893/).\n\nA Discord Forum post should be created under the **Proposals** category. The **Governance Guild** should be notified to create a new thread in Discord to facilitate community-wide participation and discussion. The goal is to receive even wider community discussion, review, and comments.\n\nThe Forum post template will show that the title should include `[DRAFT]`, and the post should be tagged with `draft-proposal`. This will allow forum members to see that this is a work-in-progress proposal.\n\n## Phase 3: Forum Vote\n\nA DDIP enters Phase 3 after it has received observable support in the discussion on the forum. Specifics on the timing of the next stage, the Snapshot vote, should be made clear in the post if required.\n\nThe Forum post will end with a **clear vote**. There should only be one affirmative vote that will move the DDIP to Snapshot voting. There should be two **No** votes. One to show support with amendments that can be left in the comments and another to indicate no support for the proposal\n\n**Quorum Requirement:** A minimum of 100 forum votes cast will constitute a quorum.\n\n**Time Requirement:** A minimum of 72-hours must pass before a voting decision is determined.\n\n**Supermajority Requirement:** A vote will be considered passed if it receives at least 66% affirmative votes.\n\n## Phase 4: Snapshot Vote and Execution\n\nThe DDIP will then be staged for elevation to Snapshot.\n\nThe Snapshot proposal will end with a clear vote. There is no quorum requirement at this time on Snapshot votes. However, voting must run for **a minimum** of 72-hours before the proposal voting period ends. Ideally, the Snapshot voting period runs for **one week**.\n\nOnce completed and if passed, execution will begin. The Governance Guild is responsible for working with the required guilds/teams/projects/leads to successfully implement the proposal. The Governance Guild will also prepare a DDIP report for the Season’s retrospective.\n\n**Quorum Requirement:** A minimum of 2% total circulating $CODE will constitute a quorum.\n\n**Time Requirement:** A minimum of 120 hours (5 days) must pass before a voting decision is determined.\n\n**Supermajority Requirement:** A vote will be considered passed if it receives at least 66% affirmative votes.\n\n# Vote\n**For** - Adopt the DDIP formalization of rules & guidelines.\n**Against** - Reject the DDIP formalization of rules & guidelines.",

      "content": "Authors: Colin4ward, Erik_Knobl, kempsterrrr, Bobbay\n\n[Previous status of paid contributors ](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-increase-the-may-june-short-term-allocations-for-retaining-core-staff-due-to-market-changes/2090/3)\n[First Draft](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-dao-operators/2161)\n[Second Draft](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/draft-2-dao-operators/2188)\n[Final Forum Vote](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-15-dao-operators/2249)\n\n## Timeline\n\n* Posting in Forum in Draft form: Wed 8 June (Delivered)\n* Move to Forum vote: Wed 15 June (Delivered 17 June)\n* Move to Snapshot vote: Wed 22 June (Delivered 1 July)\n* Submit nominations to Snapshot: Wed 22 Jun\n* Candidate vote in Snapshot concludes: Wed 29 June\n\n## Summary\n\nThere is no regulation around Paid Employees for D_D. While being a strategic position, there is no definition on: What is the scope of the role? How to become one? What tasks each one of them should perform? How should they be rewarded? How should they coordinate with the rest of the DAO?\n\nThis initiative proposes the role of the Core Operator, for members with highly specific and strategic tasks, defined by the DAO, for the improvement of the community as a whole.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\nCore Operators are members dedicated to the improvement of Developer_DAO, and rewarded by the DAO for their contributions with a monthly salary. They carry the highest degree of accountability for the success of the DAO in that they are expected to foster the culture of the collective, do the strategic planning, and drive the execution of work towards our goals. This proposal fully replaces [P-7: Formalizing our Developer DAO Operations Team](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-7-formalizing-our-developer-dao-operations-team/1716)\n\nEach Core Operator role should have the following definitions:\n\n1. Job Description. Definition of the scope of the role.\n2. Obligations. Activities the Operator does in the course of the role.\n3. Measurable Goals. Defining success; outcomes for the DAO, guilds and initiatives.\n4. Temporality and Salary.\n\nThere can be two types of Operators: directly appointed by Budget Stewards, and Guild Leads, which each Guild can define in their Budget Applications for each season.\n\n*Budget Stewards* are the Core Team and the top 5 verified members from our early contributor rewards round, chosen by DAO members. This proposal asks them to perform three tasks:\n\n*Hire Operator.* At the instance of any member of the DAO, any Steward can trigger the process to analyze the value of hiring an Operator, and discuss the issue in an open meeting with the rest of the Budget Stewards, and have a majority vote. If the vote is affirmative, the group will initiate the hiring process, discuss and define the role with the community, and submit nominations for it.\n*Approve Operator.* The Budget Stewards will review the Budget Applications of the Guilds, and any of them can issue comments and improvements on the proposal. As well, any Steward can object to a specific item in a Budget, which would trigger a majority vote for all Stewards. The item should be changed if the vote favors the objection.\n*Remove Operator.* At the instance of any member of the DAO, any Steward can trigger the process to analyze the removal of an Operator, and discuss the issue in an open meeting with the rest of the Budget Stewards, and have a majority vote. If the vote is in favor of the motion, the removal will be effective immediately.\n\n***What is the process of hiring Core Operators?***\n\n* Any Budget Steward can trigger the process by making a DDIP in the forum stating the problem the new role would solve.\n* Budget Stewards will make sure there is open discussion of the role, pros and cons.\n* Nominations can be made by anyone in the DAO at the time when Budget Stewards convoke for them, with a previous inquiry for availability and interest in the role. Each nomination can be of individual persons, and/or teams of maximum 3 persons. Each Budget Steward participating in the process is expected to make public their reasoning behind their votes and proposals.\n* The proposal will be voted in Snapshot.\n\n***How do Core Operators work in relation to the other members of the DAO?***\nCore Operators are expected to lead the DAO towards the achievement of the goals they have been hired to accomplish, coordinating guilds, projects and individual members that may be needed.\n\n***What are their Obligations?***\nOperators need an accountability mechanism. Each role has its definitions with measurable goals but the community needs to see the work is being done on a regular basis. They should present a monthly report of activities. The following is the bare minimum so people throughout the DAO can discuss whether the Operator is keeping the tasks on track.\n\n* Overview (How are they reaching their key objectives)\n* Next Steps\n* Other comments.\n\n***How are Core Operators paid?***\nTheir salary will be a base of USD amount, with $CODE incentives depending on achievement of KPIs, and defined for each role.\n\n***How does the DAO hire Operators for S1?***\nThe DAO will hire Operators when it has funds, which is expected to be the start of S1. Efforts are underway to bill S1 sponsors in advance. In the case that the DAO does not have funds available, each paid operator will have a percent of salary deferred equal to the budget deficit. Deferred salaries will be accrued and paid when the DAO has funds.\n\nThe following are the two positions suggested a part of a Hiring Process for Season 1 (discussion of these roles, and nominations for them should be done by the community and the Budget Stewards before Jun 22th):\n\n## Coordination Operator:\n\nAccountable for overall organizational process excellence, building internal coordination, with a lean on accounting.\n\n*Tasks to deliver for Season 1:*\n\n* Improve internal coordination and champion process improvements accordingly.\n* POC for legal representation in the Caymans (and anywhere else) and liaison between them and the DAO, and keep an open record of all processes.\n* Creating processes required for KYC/AML (such as ensuring grants to the DAO itself are correctly accounted for under Cayman Law), and owning these.\n* Host weekly Initiative Leads meetings, and ensure records are accessible to everyone.\n* Set cadence and structure for hosting monthly DAO wide town halls in coordination with the Community Guild.\n* Oversee the Seasonal Budget application process and tracking of how budgets are finalized, allocated and distributed, as well as any incoming revenue.\n* Define and maintain access permissions across DAO tooling (discord, discourse etc.) to ensure organizational security. Work with any team looking to implement change to DAO tooling or structure to ensure it doesn’t harm coordination as a whole (at the DAO > Guild level).\n* Creating a process for issuing, fulfilling and tracking finances for The Developer DAO Foundation and any other entity created to support the DAO functioning (this may include hiring external partners given compliance risk in maintaining accounts correctly).\n* Establish a $CODE buyback mechanism in partnership with the Governance Guild.\n\n*KPIs:*\n\n* 80% of active projects/initiatives submit applications to receive $CODE funding\n* Foundation successfully receives S1 sponsorship funds and pays all S1 financial obligations based on approved proposals\n* First $CODE buyback successfully completed ($CODE returned to treasury)\n* Agreements executed with at least one subsidiary initiative (e.g. pixeldevs, web3con) and one affiliate initiative (e.g. p3rks, DAO Agency)\n\n*Temporality and Rewards:*\n\n* Base salary will be $8,000 USD monthly for one Season, plus incentives up to 5,000 $CODE for achievement of KPIs. (25% of the total for each KPI achieved), to be delivered at the end of the season.\n\n## Fundraising Operator:\n\nAccountable for overall organizational process excellence, building internal coordination, with a lean on fundraising.\n\n*Tasks to deliver for Season 1:*\n\n* Create the legal infrastructure for projects looking to apply for grants.\n* Establish a documented process for qualifying projects for grant applications under Developer DAO banner.\n* Develop a standard agreement between the DAO and projects which receive DAO funding or other resources.\n* Establish a documented pipeline of grant sources and build relationships with those granting entities.\n* Create an internal database of the projects and initiatives that will allow organizational visibility and better coordination.\n* Create guides and info resources that support internal projects who are looking to stand up their own infrastructure (i.e. multi-sigs) and entities (i.e. legal structures).\n* Support the creation of a Guild dedicated to support these efforts.\n\n*KPIs:*\n\n* Legal setting for at least one type of Grant application being accessible to DAO projects.\n* Database has been implemented.\n* 30% of applications received funding\n* $30k of total grant funding for projects\n* $100k of endowment funding\n\n*Temporality and Rewards:*\n\n* Base salary will be $8,000 USD monthly for one Season, plus incentives up to 5,000 $CODE for achievement of KPIs. (20% of the total for each KPI achieved), to be delivered at the end of the season.\n\n",

      "content": "# Increase the May & June Short-Term Allocations for Retaining Core Staff Due to Market Changes\n\n**Authors:** tonyolendo, willblackurn.eth\nView the [forum vote](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-14-increase-the-may-june-short-term-allocations-for-retaining-core-staff-due-to-market-changes/2125).\n*Note - a regularly scheduled GTC distribution was sent on June 1st that is accounted for in the proposal below. This distribution had not occurred at the start of the forum proposal voting stage.*\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal seeks to amend the terms of the proposal [P-9: Short-term Treasury Allocation to Retain Core Staff](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0x157019768a338f666dc543734358987d992ff6feb4c68e21ec6d46c6c7906db9) to adjust and immediately release their allocations to insulate against further market volatility.\n\n## Motivation\nGitcoin was an early partner to Developer DAO and gave the DAO a grant whose purpose was to retain full-time core staff. Proposal P-9 sought to effect the Gitcoin grant by rewarding the full-time contributions of with-heart, Kempsterrrr, and RyanCoordinator in the form of 1,000 GTC per month, starting February 1, 2022, through the end of June, 2022. When the proposal was being contemplated, the price of GTC was $10, at the time of the passing of the P9 proposal, the price of GTC had dropped to $6, almost half the value. The spirit of P9 was that GTC would trade at around $10 and thus the Retained Core Staff would receive a compensation of roughly $10,000 per month ($10 x 1000GTC). The current price of GTC is now $2.33 meaning that the projected monthly income for Retained Core Staff has fallen from $10000 to $2330. That’s a 76.7% drop in income, that would make anyone uncomfortable. As Ryan stated in his comments on P-9, “Using GTC in this way is a short term measure to get us on stable footing and keep the lights on.”\n\n## Scope\nThis proposal seeks to adjust June payments to 3500 GTC per full-time contributor and to retroactively adjust the payment for May by an additional 2500 GTC per full-time contributor on top of the already distributed 1000 GTC per full-time contributor. We further propose that these payments for June and May be released immediately upon governance approval in one transaction to mitigate the risk of any further drops in prices due to market conditions.\n\nTo complete this, it would require a total of `18,000 GTC = (2500 GTC * 3) + (3500 GTC * 3)`. In our partnership with Gitcoin ([P-4: Partnership & Mutual Grant with Gitcoin](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0xfafbac6a39f5991497856ac2c4b941c0b020d442280eea8eeebe0b88bd6f913c)), we committed to holding no less than 50% of the initial token grant through 2023. This means that we can only use 13,000 GTC for this proposal.\n\nWe plan to use ETH held by the treasury to cover the value of the remaining 5,000 GTC (`18,000 GTC - 13,000 GTC`) . As of this proposal, this would require `6.0565 ETH` from the treasury which has a balance of 11.603 ETH. The final calculation of ETH to distribute will be completed at time of the transaction once this proposal has passed Governance, but it should not exceed a total of 6.5 ETH regardless of the ETH to GTC price.\n\nThis proposal does not seek to expand the period of time set in [P-9: Short-term Treasury Allocation to Retain Core Staff](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0x157019768a338f666dc543734358987d992ff6feb4c68e21ec6d46c6c7906db9). Rewards beyond this time period will require a new proposal with updated context for contributions.\n\n### Update on June distribution\n\nA regularly scheduled June distribution of 3,000 GTC (1,000 per contributor) was sent to the full-time contributors that can be viewed [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe2c7ea867cf7addc8cc6c77df9900023a1dbeb5b11b9cc534840e61fb3a5b8fe). That is considered part of the total amount defined here.\n\n## Benefits\nThe continued full-time commitment of with-heart, Kempsterrrr, and RyanCoordinator to the DAO.\n\n## Drawbacks\nThis utilizes all of our liquid GTC from the treasury and dips into ETH received from NFT sale royalties. We believe it is worth it at this time to ensure our full-time contributors are taken care of and are able to focus on Developer DAO.\n\n## Vote\n**For** - Enable the immediate calculation and distribution of treasury GTC & ETH as defined in the proposal for full-time core staff.\n\n**Against** - Do not enable the immediate distribution of treasury GTC & ETH",

      "content": "**Authors:** willblackburn, marc, kempsterrrr, nader, with-heart, erik\n[View Forum Vote](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-11-request-advisor-allocation-of-0-45-to-ryan-coordinator/1891)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal requests an advisor allocation of **0.45% $CODE** to be granted to Ryan Coordinator for his early advisor contributions. First, Ryan led the Gitcoin partnership conversation on both sides. Second, Ryan has led the legal entity setup of the DAO.\n\nUpon passing, Ryan will be ineligible for Early Contributor Rewards resulting in any Coordinape votes being removed.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRyan Coordinator has been essential in advising the DAO in two main ways.\n\nRyan led the Gitcoin partnership as a member of Developer DAO and Moonshot Collective. Ryan helped coordinate calls, build relationships, and advise the DAO as partnership details were being discussed. The Gitcoin partnership was a key point in Developer DAO’s history as it both established the DAO as legitimate and provided our treasury with GTC.\n\nRyan has also played an advisor role as Developer DAO considered legal entity options. Ryan coordinated a number of meetings with potential legal counsel before spearheading the effort to begin establishing a Foundation for the DAO.\n\nWe believe this proposal is a win-win. It rewards Ryan for his advisor role with well-deserved governing power, while also incentivizing his continued role in building Developer DAO.\n\n**Note:** Advisors and Founding Team members are not eligible for Early Contributor Rewards ahead of the $CODE launch. This advisor allocation will be subject to the same advisor vesting defined in [P-5: Governance Token Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0x6c141b9efbfad6b370581eebf505408ba7f8619264b7e8ca03118fdf89975c97).\n\n## Drawbacks\nThis will utilize 0.45% of our 2% unallocated advisors allocation, leaving 1.55% remaining.\n\n## Vote\n**For** - Grant an advisor allocation of 0.45% $CODE to Ryan Coordinator\n**Against** - Do not grant an advisor allocation of 0.45% $CODE to Ryan Coordinator",

      "title": "P-12: Formalize External Proposals Delegate Process",
      "content": "**Authors:** josevelez.eth, rahobbs88, willblackburn.eth\n[View Forum Vote](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-12-formalize-external-proposals-delegate-process/1892)\n\n## Summary\n\nD_D is being entrusted to participate in external DAO proposals, whereby it will represent the interests of members belonging to those external DAOs. If D_D positions itself to be nominated as a delegate in external DAOs, it is our responsibility to be present and participate.\n\nExternal DAO proposals surface often and sometimes with limited time to participate. As such, a process should be formalized that facilitates the formation and maintenance of delegate committees that can be entrusted to make an election on behalf of the D_D community in a timely manner.\n\n## Scope of Work\n\nBelow we make the following proposals to formalize an external proposals delegation process. Some of the below has already been implemented in practice.\n\n### External Proposal Delegate Committee\n#### Membership and Composition\n\n- The committee will begin with 5 delegates and build up over time to a maximum of 11. The initial 5 delegates will be selected through a process to be determined by the DD community, via snapshot or forum vote.\n- At any time thereafter, the addition of new delegates will follow the same process determined above.\n- Committee members can leave the Delegate Committee at any time, for any reason. This vacated position does not need to be immediately filled unless it drops membership to below 5 members.\n- All committee members must also be members of Developer DAO.\n\n#### Community Visibility\n\nThe committee formation, deliberation and decision process needs to be fully transparent. This means that from the very beginning, we need to ensure that our members can follow along or catchup easily to past or active proposals.\n\nWe propose a process that begins with a dedicated Discord channel for External DAO Proposals. It can sit under the Governance Guild but it needs to be open to all members without needing to join the guild. Additionally, a forum category or label will be created for forum posts.\n\nA delegate can create a new thread or forum post to begin discussion about an external proposal that D_D is a delegate to. In this, the following should be included and pinned to the top:\n\n- A link to the external vote (i.e., Snapshot) and discussion (i.e., Forum)\n- The Snapshot Start and End dates\n- A discord poll to allow voting among the D_D community\n- A deadline for closing the discussion and moving to effect our vote on Snapshot\n\nThis would help consolidate discussions in an easy to find and consumable manner.\n\nThe Delegate Committee would propagate the proposal throughout the community using all available tools including the announcement channel and DAO newsletter (if time permits). They would also post a poll to gauge sentiment toward the proposal within the DAO.\n\nOnce a discord poll has been created and the deadline for participation has passed, a screenshot of the poll result should be saved to the proposal thread.\n\nOnce the Snapshot vote has been completed, the thread or forum post can be archived, but always available for future review and transparency.\n\n#### Role of the Delegate Committee\n\nThe role of the Delegate Committee is to:\n\n- Communicate all proposals from an external DAO to the Developer DAO community in a clear and timely manner that is sufficient to allow for community discussion before the vote is executed by the committee.\n- Gauge community sentiment surrounding the proposal via discussion and polling.\n- Answer questions from the community regarding the external proposals to the best of their ability.\n- Execute a vote on the external DAO proposal that is consistent with community sentiment as well as Developer DAO’s values. If there is a conflict between community sentiment and Developer DAO’s values, then they must vote consistent with the DAO’s values.\n- This must all be done in a way that is transparent to the Developer DAO community.\n\n#### Further specifications\n\nFurther specifications can be found in the [Forum vote](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-12-formalize-external-proposals-delegate-process/1892) for this proposal. All specifications are considered included in this proposal.\n\n## Vote\n\n**For** - Recognize the formalization of the External Proposals Delegate Process\n**Against** - Do not recognize the formalization of the External Proposals Delegate Process",

Presently, they each dedicate full-time hours to the DAO unpaid. In order to maintain our momentum into Season 1 and beyond, this proposal is to reward their efforts from the DAO treasury at the rate of 1k GTC/month per person through the end June, 2022.\n\nThe expected length of seasons, starting in Season 1, is four months. This effectively presents with-heart, Kempsterrr, and RyanCoordinator with short-term engagements through Season 1, which limits the risk to the DAO and enables them to continue to set the DAO up for long-term success.\n\nThe recent partnership and mutual grant with GitcoinDAO (P-4: Partnership & Mutual Grant with Gitcoin) was agreed to with exactly this sort of proposal in mind:\n\n> For our community to thrive, realise its potential and deliver on this mission, we need to lay the right foundations for growth and have the resources to bootstrap operations and retain a team where needed. Forming partnerships with other DAOs who have a well aligned mission and have been on this journey before will help us tackle these challenges faster than we otherwise would be able to.\n\n## Benefits\nThe continued full-time commitment of with-heart, Kempsterrrr, and RyanCoordinator to the DAO.\n\n## Drawbacks\nThe utilization of 1k GTC per month per recipient from the DAO treasury through June for a total of 15k GTC.\n\n## Vote\nVote **For** to allow this use of treasury GTC.\nVote **Against** to disallow this use of treasury GTC.",

On the final public mint from the original contact, the decision was taken by the Core Team to suspend new membership based on NFT ownership in an effort to ensure speculators on the NFT would not be rewarded in the airdrop of our upcoming governance token, $CODE.\n\nCommunity feedback was clear that there was a consensus for this decision and that holding the NFT, regardless of how this was attained, should still provide individuals with access to the Community.\n\nOnce the governance token exists, snapshot voting will be converted to utilize that token; the Genesis NFT will no longer convey voting rights, but still provide full access to the community on Discord.\n\n\n## Scope of work\n\nCorrect all messaging regarding the NFT not providing DAO membership and ensure any token gating in the future includes wallets that hold this token as well as the new governance token $CODE when launched.\n\n## Success Metrics & KPIs\nN/A\n ## Vote\n\n- Support genesis NFTs granting non-voting membership\n- Oppose genesis NFTs granting non-voting membership\n\n\n[Link to forum vote](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/issuance-topic-1-should-the-original-nft-devs-for-revolution-give-access-to-the-discord-server-after-we-switch-to-the-governance-token/1337)\n",

      "title": "P-7: Formalizing our Developer DAO Operations Team",
      "content": "**Title**: Formalizing our Developer DAO Operations Team\n**Authors**: RyanCoordinator, Kempsterrrr\n\nThis is a concrete step forward in following through with our official community Season 0 roadmap: [P-3: Developer DAO Season 0](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0x52fc76fe5865cf038b89b8c6ef78b6e691c0ab9c2b1228b84b0813b7832ce369)\n\nAt the top level, the Ops team handles challenges that are common across guilds and across the DAO. The Ops team is not a top-down control structure, but exists to help and support our guilds and members.\n\n## Why an Ops team:\n\n- Large operational DAO challenges were previously the responsibility of individual guilds, or the founding team, or unaccounted for, and bringing them together allows us to move forward effectively without confusion and diffusion of responsibility. Many processes are currently blocked, and formalizing the Ops team will help us get unblocked.\n\n## Purpose of the operations team:\n\n- Support and enable members and contributors to successfully execute on Developer DAO’s mission by putting in place and maintaining operational systems and structures.\nResponsibilities of the operations team:\n\n- Coordinate to harmonize initiatives and reduce duplicated efforts across DAO guilds. ( e.g. Onboarding efforts, tooling setup, comms announcements, etc. )\n\n- Actively maintaining context across the DAO by having an Ops team member attend guild weekly calls and liaise with guild leaders.\n\n- Coordinating guilds to find, focus, and execute on specific season and period priorities.\n\n- Helping to tame and manage common DAO infrastructure, like the governance forum (getting sign-in-with-ethereum and restricting posting to DAO members) and the Discord server (streamlining the Discord server experience will not be simple or quick or easy!) Notion, bots, calendars, etc.\n\n- DAO onboarding and offboarding policies and procedures, including empowering people to take on suitable roles within the DAO. This is going to be a HUGE effort and critical to our success as we open the floodgates to new members.\n\n- Legal and accounting policies and procedures, and owning relationships with compliance professionals working on behalf of the DAO (Accountants, Lawyers, etc). This includes defining budgets processes, contributor rewards, and treasury management and putting appropriate plans through our community governance process.\n\n- Safeguarding DAO and member capacity to prioritize execution and prevent burnout. ( eg scheduling 1-on-1 priority and cadence setting calls with contributors, coordinating guilds around DAO season priorities, recruiting for underserved teams, etc. )\n\n## Current state of the operations team:\n\n[Kempsterrr](https://twitter.com/kempsterrrr) and [RyanCoordinator](https://twitter.com/ryancoordinator) have been working full-time in operations roles for the DAO and will be the first co-leads of the official D_D Ops team. The DAO and its operational needs are under active development and evolution. Many roles and teams will need to be started and nurtured in order to execute on Ops team responsibilities, and the landscape will change drastically as the DAO grows through Season 1. This plan for the Ops team takes on and makes explicit the tasks and responsibilities the original core team has been taking on by default, and the formal creation of this Ops team follows our ratified Season 0 roadmap. The Ops team expects to issue a revised scope and plan at the beginning of D_D Season 2 to report to the community and refine our operational posture. We will also be in constant contact with our members to ensure their needs are being met.\n\nDeveloper DAO has been working with our partner Gitcoin to advance the structure of our DAO and they have committed $GTC for the purpose of setting foundations, funding our operations, and retaining operational staff. We will be following through with this while we work towards the release of D_D’s $CODE governance token and $CODE denominated budgets for guilds and initiatives.\n\nThe process of evolving the DAO structure includes redefining the role of the ‘core team’, from now on referred to as the ‘founding team’, and the official establishment of the Ops team is an important step towards delegating previous founding team duties to official DAO organs. The founding team will not be leaving us, and continue to be vitally important members of our community, and will not be abandoning their responsibilities as signers on the treasury mutli-sig. Having a strong equality between guild leaders and founding team is a limiting factor to the growth of our guilds and community that we are now outgrowing and moving beyond.\n\n## In summary:\n\nFollowing through on Developer DAO’s Season 0 roadmap and setting us up for success requires a dedicated full-time operations staff with an explicit mandate. Please vote to YES to formally recognize and empower our already working full-time staff, and support them so they can support our DAO. Voting YES on this proposal is voting YES on moving Developer DAO forward.\n\n## Vote\n\n- Support formalizing DAO operations team\n- Oppose formalizing DAO operations team\n\n[Link to forum vote on this proposal](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p-7-formalizing-our-developer-dao-operations-team/1716)",

      "title": "P-5: Governance Token Proposal",
      "content": "\n**Title:** Proposal for a Developer DAO ERC-20 Governance Token\n**Authors:** willblackburn, kempsterrrr, nader, marc, with-heart, Erik_Knobl\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal outlines the creation of a Developer DAO governance token - $CODE.\n\n## Token & Developer DAO Overview\n\nDeveloper DAO seeks to onboard, educate, and support web3 developers with the goal to build web3 tools and public goods. With an explosion in growth, the DAO needs to further decentralize. The creation of a governance token will help the DAO expand its operations and membership through a diversified community treasury.\n\nThe token - $CODE - will provide the governing power to accomplish these goals, done by distributing tokens to existing members. A treasury will be established for future partnerships and contributions while governance will accrue to members that contribute to the future successes of Developer DAO.\n\nThe decision to create a new governance token comes as an expansion upon the Genesis NFT - Devs for Revolution. While these NFTs will be used for early voting, it does not solve for partnerships, future memberships, and future contributors. Therefore, $CODE will become the primary governance token for Developer DAO moving forward.\n\n$CODE is an ERC-20 token on mainnet Ethereum using audited and battle-tested smart contracts open-sourced by OpenZeppelin. $CODE is a non-financial governance token.\n\n## Token Distribution\n\n### Token Distribution\nThere will be 10,000,000 initial $CODE tokens.\n\n50% to the Developer DAO Treasury\n25% to current members\n10% to founding team and advisors*\n10% to early contributors\n5% to partners\n\\* subject to vesting\n\nAdditional $CODE tokens can be minted through the governance process. This option provides protection for the DAO. Additional minting of $CODE tokens can also be fully disabled in the smart contract through the governance process.\n\n### Developer DAO Treasury\n\nThe Developer DAO Treasury - found at 0x7128f5ff32eD07Ce12E6a9deBE32BB40F9884b3C - will receive 50% of $CODE tokens. The treasury will be governed by $CODE holders and exists to further the mission of the DAO to onboard web3 developers.\n\nTokens held in the DAO treasury will not be used for governance. Distributions from the Treasury will only come from additional proposals that pass the full governance voting process.\n\n### CODEdrop - Current Members\n\nCurrent Members of the Developer DAO will receive 25% of $CODE tokens via a retroactive airdrop. Current Members are defined as any genesis NFT holder at block #13612670 83. Using a snapshot of members at this time helps counter Sybil attacks leading to unwanted members receiving a large amount of governing power.\n\n$CODE will be distributed to members as follows:\n\n**Distribution Equation:**\nMember allocation = 400 (NFT) + 359 (pre-season 0 POAP or pre-season 0 snapshot vote)*\n\n\\* note: the final numbers will be determined by each snapshot NFT holder receiving 400 tokens and then dividing the remaining current members allocation amount by the number of accounts eligible for the POAP/Vote bonus.\n\nEvery member will receive 400 tokens for holding the NFT at the time of the snapshot. At the start of Season 1 (TBD), 400 $CODE tokens will give membership access to the DAO. If a member holds a POAP from our Developer DAO town halls before Season 0 OR voted on either of our first two snapshot proposals, they will receive an additional 359* tokens. A member can receive up to 759* tokens through the airdrop alone.\n\nMembers will receive governance tokens through a claim process. Token claims will be available for six months, after which the Developer DAO can retrieve unclaimed tokens to be added to the Treasury.\n\n### Founding Team & Advisors\n\nThe Founding Team (6 members) and Advisors (2 members) will receive 10% of $CODE tokens. The Founding Team will retain 6%, current Advisors will retain 0.9%, and 3.1% will be set aside for future allocation.\n\n50% of the Founder Team & Advisors allocation will vest at token issuance with 50% of the tokens subject to a 2 year vesting period. Distributions will happen monthly. Vested tokens can be used as governing power, while unvested tokens cannot.\n\nIt is essential for the DAO to have committed members helping lead and structure DAO operations and governance. Incentivizing these members is key to this goal. The lockup and vesting periods ensure that governing power starts in the hands of the DAO members and stays there.\n\n### Early Contributors\n\nEarly Contributors will receive 10% of $CODE tokens in addition to the airdrop. It is important we recognize early contributions made to the DAO before fanfare and a reward mechanism was in place. The 10% of $CODE tokens will be allocated by DAO members using Coordinape after this proposal passes. Founding Team & Advisors will not be eligible for these rewards.\n\n### Partners\n\nGitcoin will receive 5% of the token. Gitcoin has been identified as a perfect partner for Developer DAO with aligned missions and values. By partaking in a governance token swap, we receive governing power of the Gitcoin DAO.\n\nThe Gitcoin partnership, to be passed in a separate governance vote, allocated 50,000 GTC to the Developer DAO treasury in exchange for 5% of the $CODE supply.\n\n## Governance Tokens & Distribution Advice\n\nTo draft our governance token proposal and formulate the token distribution, industry standards and leading advisors were consulted.\n\n### Cooper Turley\n\nAn early advocate for DAOs, Cooper has been an important contributor and advisor to a number of Governance Token launches including Gitcoin and ENS. Cooper has worked closely with the Developer DAO team to present the structure and rollout of this proposal and the $CODE token.\n\n### Preethi Kasireddy\n\nPreethi is an experienced teacher, founder, engineer, investor, and banker who has built smart contracts for various crypto projects. Preethi started her crypto career as a software engineer at Coinbase and helped launch Ethereum onto the Coinbase platform. Preethi will help us become the #1 platform for Web 3.0 developers through marketing, developing new partnerships, writing technical posts, and more.\n\n## Vote\n**Yes** - Create the $CODE token\n**No** - Do not create the $CODE token",

These are two key milestones however there is still lots to do to ensure we can lay the right foundations for the DAO.\n\n## Scope of work\n\nThe extra two months will give the community time to discuss and propose solutions to the following objectives:\n\n* Ratifying tokenomics\n* Design and execute token launch\n* Refining the DAOs Structure to support future growth\n* Refining our Governance procedures\n* How we recognise and rewards contributions\n* Clarifying Season 1 priority projects and objectives for the DAO as a whole and individual Guilds\n* Planning launch event with industry partners\n\n## Success Metrics & KPIs\n\nDeliver on the above objectives.\n\n## Vote\n\nSupport extension of Season 0 to March 12th\nOppose extension Season 0 to March 12th and keep current end date of Jan 12th\n\nSee our [forum vote](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p6-revised-timeline-for-season-0/1578) on this proposal.",

      "content": "**Title:** Partnership & Mutual Grant with Gitcoin\n**Authors:** kempsterrrr, dabit3, willblackburn, marc, Erik_Knobl\n**Created Date:** December 15, 2021\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal, if passed, would issue 5% of the Developer DAO Governance token (when live) in exchange for 50,000 GTC. The purpose of this alliance is to help ensure that Gitcoin and Developer DAO can work together to coordinate bringing more web2 developers into web3 than ever before through education and events, as well as supporting the creation and distribution of public goods.\n\n## Motivation\nDeveloper DAO’s mission is to accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of web3 builders.\n\nFor our community to thrive, realise its potential and deliver on this mission, we need to lay the right foundations for growth and have the resources to bootstrap operations and retain a team where needed. Forming partnerships with other DAOs who have a well aligned mission and have been on this journey before will help us tackle these challenges faster than we otherwise would be able to.\n\nGitcoin’s mission is to build & fund the open web. Their innovations in Quadratic Funding have resulted in funding for over 1,900 open source projects to the tune of ~ $40m and around 300,000 developers actively use their public goods each month to learn, earn, connect and fund what they are doing.\n\nThese achievements and ambitions resonate extremely well with ours, and Gitcoin’s substantial experience establishing and growing a DAO are invaluable to us as we embark on a similar journey.\n\nWe see this relationship complementing Developer DAO in the following ways:\n\n- Enabling even more developers to have a voice in the future direction of Gitcoin via allocation of their Governance token (GTC) into the Developer DAO treasury.\n- Strengthen ties between and improve the shared bandwidth of Gitcoin and Developer DAO teams (Moonshot Coordinator, Austin Griffth, Nader Dabit, Cooper Turley, Preethi Kasireddy, kempsterrrr).\n- Collaborating on workshops, events and hackathons with Austrin Griffith and the Moonshot Collective workstream, to further the reach and impact of Gitcoin’s public goods efforts.\n- Co-creating prototypes between Moonshot + Developer DAO that play well with the Loot ecosystem vibes / memes.\n\n## Specification\nThe passing of this proposal would transfer 50,000 GTC to 0x7128f5ff32eD07Ce12E6a9deBE32BB40F9884b3C, Developer DAO’s specified Treasury address.\n\nOn the launch of Developer DAO’s governance token, a 5% allocation would be transferred to 0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6, Gitcoin’s multisig address for easier delegation / voting.\n\nUse of Funds\n\nTo ensure long term alignment, Developer DAO will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the Gitcoin ecosystem.\n\nTo ensure long term alignment, Gitcoin will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the Developer DAO ecosystem.\n\n## Benefits\nSee “Motivation” section above\n\n## Drawbacks\n5% of our Governance token will be issued to Gitcoin at launch.\n\n## Prior Discussion & Forum Vote\nPlease see prior discussion and our forum vote [here](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p4-partnership-mutual-grant-with-gitcoin/548).\n\n## Vote\nVote `For` to support the partnership & mutual grant. Vote `Against` to deny the partnership & mutual grant. There is no necessary quorum for this proposal. A majority `For` vote passes the proposal.",

Season 0 will start on the passing of this Snapshot vote by majority and last for two months with the option to extend for one further month via another Snapshot vote.\n\n## Objectives for Season 0\n- Ratify our mission, values, and goals. [completed]\n- Implement and refine the DAO Structure and improve external and internal on-boarding processes for joining the DAO and contributing.\n- Implement and refine the Governance process and guidelines for community decision making.\n- Research and propose options for governance token issue & DAO legal structure (if required).\n- Create space for bigger picture conversations about the DAO and identify Core Projects we want to back as a community through into Season 1.\n- Plan Season 1 launch event with partners.\n\n## DAO Structure & Guilds\nThe DAO structure consists of a governance layer, a core team, and our guilds. The core team being initially staffed by Guild “Leaders”. Projects are worked on by pulling resources from guilds.\n\nFor Season 0 we have a proposed 6 Guilds and Leaders (below) based on existing contributions to the DAO. This suggestion is not a permanent setup but allows us to move forward. Core Team roles, how Guilds are established and how Leaders are “elected” will be refined in the community via our Governance process during Season 0.\n\nCore team Season 0 Objectives:\n\n- Deploy DAO Treasury, fund with initial capital and produce proposals for further funding (internal/external).\n- Implement DAO Structure for Season 0. This will be refined moving forward by the Community Guild moving forward based on feedback from members.\n- Implement Governance for Season 0: to be refined during going forward by the Governance Guild.\n\nGuild | Leader\n---|---\nCommunity & Ops | kempsterrrr\nDesign | Eknobl\nDeveloper | Mark (with-heart)\nWriters/Editorial | marc\nGovernance | willblackburn\nMarketing/Biz Dev | Nader\n\n# Full Season 0 Specification\n\nYou can read the [full specification here](https://forum.developerdao.com/t/p3-developer-dao-season-0/219), where it was discussed and approved on our forum.\n\n",
