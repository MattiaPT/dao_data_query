      "title": "[NIP-88] Update Prime Cash Curves",
      "content": "We propose to change the Prime Cash interest rate models on Notional with the aim of enhancing deposit growth, optimizing utilization levels, and creating a more balanced interest rate environment for Notional’s users. Below are the details of the proposed changes and the rationale behind them.\n\n### Proposed Changes\n\n1. Increase target utilization levels (Kink2):\n\n  * Current Issue: The interest rates under the current kink are not sufficiently attractive to potential depositors. This leads to stagnant deposit growth and suboptimal utilization levels.\n  * Proposal: Raise the target (kink2) utilization levels to make the interest rate curves more efficient. Lower the kink1 utilization level to smooth the curves.\n  * Expected Outcome: Higher utilization targets will increase supply rates for lenders before rates exceed the kink, attracting additional deposits and improving liquidity.\n\n2. Increase Kink2 rates in line with increased Kink2 utilization:\n\n  * Current Issue: The interest rates at the current kink are not sufficiently attractive to potential depositors.\n  * Proposal: Raise the target (kink2) rates to make it possible for interest rates to sit at sustainably higher levels (below kink2).\n  * Expected Outcome: Higher kink2 rates will make it easier to attract depositors in the event that attractive leveraged yield strategies produce additional borrowing demand.\n\n3. Decrease the max rate for ETH:\n\n  * Current Issue: The existing max rate is overly punitive, causing highly negative APYs for leveraged yield users when rates go above the kink. This discourages participation without significantly aiding in risk mitigation.\n  * Proposal: Lower the max rate for ETH to more reasonable levels that still incentivize leveraged yield users to deleverage when necessary.\n  * Expected Outcome: A fairer interest rate environment that encourages sustained participation from leveraged yield users while maintaining effective utilization control.\n\n### Rationale\n\n* Borrower Behavior on Notional:\n  * Unlike other lending protocols dominated by cross-currency borrowers, Notional's borrowing activity is primarily driven by leveraged yield users.\n  * These users are more responsive to spiking borrow rates and tend to deleverage quickly, reducing utilization organically without the need for excessively high max rates.\n* Risk Considerations:\n  * Cross-Currency Debt Exposure: Notional has relatively little cross-currency debt compared to its overall size (~85% of Notional’s open debt comes from leveraged yield strategies). The majority of debt stems from leveraged yield strategies, which pose less insolvency risk even at high utilization levels.\n  * Collateral Concentration in wBTC: Any cross-currency debt is predominantly collateralized with wBTC. By maintaining a lower target utilization parameter for wBTC, we mitigate the risk of liquidation failures during market downturns.\n\n### Risk Mitigation\n\nWhile increasing kink2 utilization levels could theoretically reduce the pool of unutilized assets available for liquidations during price drops, the following factors mitigate this risk:\n\n1. Limited Cross-Currency Exposure: The protocol's minimal cross-currency debt reduces the potential impact of high utilization on liquidation processes.\n2. Strategic Parameter Adjustments for wBTC: Keeping wBTC's target utilization low ensures sufficient liquidity is available to handle liquidations if needed.\n\n### Proposed Parameter Changes\n\n|Parameters|ETH|Stablecoins|LSDs|wBTC|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Kink Utilization 1|No Change|80 -> 75|70 -> 55|65 -> 55|\n|Kink Utilization 2|80 -> 90|85 -> 92|75 -> 80|No Change|\n|Kink Rate 1|2.29% -> 2.36%|No Change|1.17% -> 0.59%|0.59%|\n|Kink Rate 2|6.09% -> 7.07%|7.07% -> 7.85%|2.93% -> 3.52%|2.34% - 3.52%|\n|Max Rate|195% -> 100.5%|No Change|No Change|No Change|\n\n### New Parameters\n\n|Parameters|ETH|Stablecoins|LSDs|wBTC|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|kinkUtilization1|75 (75%)|75 (75%)|55 (55%)|55 (55%)|\n|kinkUtilization2|90 (90%)|92 (92%)|80 (80%)|70 (70%)|\n|kinkRate1 (1/256)|6 (2.36%)|10 (3.93%)|1 (0.59%)|1 (0.59%)|\n|kinkRate2 (1/256)|18 (7.07%)|20 (7.85%)|6 (3.52%)|6 (3.52%)|\n|maxRate25BPS|192 (100.5%)|192 (100.5%)|225 (150%)|225 (150%)|\n|feeRatePercent|20 (20%)|20 (20%)|20 (20%|20 (20%|\n|minFeeRate5BPS|10 (0.50%)|10 (0.50%)|10 (0.50%)|10 (0.50%)|\n|maxFeeRate25BPS|160 (40%)|160 (40%)|160 (40%)|160 (40%)|\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy implementing these changes, we aim to:\n\n* Enhance Deposit Growth: More attractive supply rates under the kink will encourage additional deposits, improving overall liquidity.\n* Optimize Utilization Levels: Adjusted utilization targets will lead to more efficient use of assets within the protocol.\n* Create a Balanced Interest Rate Environment: Fairer max rates for ETH and stablecoins will support sustained participation from leveraged yield users without compromising risk management.",

      "title": "[NIP-87] List a Convex tBTC/wBTC leveraged vault (Mainnet)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing a WBTC Curve [leveraged vault](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/leveraged-vaults/what-are-leveraged-vaults) on Notional V3 Mainnet. The vault would allow users to borrow WBTC from Notional’s Mainnet deployment at a variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Curve [tBTC/WBTC pool ](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crvusd-16/deposit) and stake the pool tokens on Convex to earn pool rewards.\n\n# Proposal & parameters\n\nWe propose listing a WBTC leveraged vault using the Curve [tBTC/WBTC pool ](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crvusd-16/deposit) as a strategy. We propose listing that leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.03 (3%)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.13|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.23|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|50 WBTC|\n|Minimum borrow size|1 WBTC|\n|feeRate5BPS|10 (50 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|80%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|20%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|1.50%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Curve tBTC/WBTC pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity up to 50 WBTC to cap the maximum amount of WBTC that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. In practice Notional governors will increase the maximum capacity of the vault in line with demand and WBTC liquidity up to the 50 WBTC maximum vault capacity threshold. We propose setting the maximum pool share at 20% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 20% of Curve tBTC/WBTC pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 8.7X such that if a user deposits 0.10 WBTC, he can at a maximum borrow 0.77 WBTC from Notional to LP in the Curve tBTC/WBTC pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in the pool’s token value. Setting the strategy’s maximum leverage ratio at 8.7X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -8.85% in the pool’s token value (tBTC/WBTC LP tokens) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (WBTC). It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol against a decrease in the value of pool tokens relative to users’ debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.23, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 5.3X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 8.7X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times in a short period of time.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 1 WBTC and the vault liquidation discount at 3%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions (ex: high gas environment). To do so, a liquidator’s revenue from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 1 WBTC and the liquidation discount at 3%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 0.03 WBTC. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount is likely cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 0.5% such that borrowers will pay a 0.5% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves and 20% are paid to nWBTC holders.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.50%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool prices deviate from the oracle prices by more than 1.5%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure user can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Risks\n\n## Oracle\n\nWe propose using the Chainlink tBTC/USD oracle to check that the implied Curve tBTC/WBTC pool price is in line with the overall market.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThe tBTC redemption process by which tBTC can be redeemed for BTC can take up to [multiple hours](https://tbtcscan.com/redeems). The redemption time period could lead to the tBTC price decreasing against the WBTC price while redemptions are in progress. This would lead to a situation where the Curve tBTC/WBTC pool composition is made mostly of tBTC. In such a situation, it could be impossible to flash liquidate an account breaching the Notional’s maximum leverage ratio. By listing this leverage vault Notional implicitly accepts tBTC as a collateral asset.\n\nThe tBTC liquidity risk can be somewhat mitigated by capping the protocol’s exposure at 20% of the pool and by setting the maximum vault capacity in line with Notional’s WBTC liquidity.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "title": "[NIP-86] List tBTC as a collateral asset on Ethereum and Arbitrum",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing tBTC as a collateral asset on Ethereum and Arbitrum. tBTC will be a variable lend/borrow asset. This proposal does not call for fixed rate tBTC markets.\n\ntBTC has recently emerged as a leading alternative to wBTC for BTC holders to use their Ethereum in DeFi and take out loans against their BTC collateral. We believe that deepening Notional’s collaboration with Threshold Network could bring on new borrow demand, help acquire new users, and provide significant upside for Notional’s potential future growth.\n\n# Proposed listing parameters\n\nProposed collateral parameters for tBTC on Ethereum and Arbitrum:\n\n|Parameter|Proposed value (Ethereum)|Proposed value (Arbitrum)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Collateral haircut|0.84|0.80|\n|Debt Buffer|1.20|1.25|\n|Liquidation discount|1.06|1.06|\n|Supply cap|100 tBTC|50 tBTC|\n\nImplied max LTVs vs. USDC on Ethereum and Arbitrum:\n\n|Pair|Min collateral ratio|Max LTV|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|tBTC/USDC (Ethereum)|130%|77%|\n|tBTC/USDC (Arbitrum)|136%|73%|\n\nProposed variable interest rate market parameters:\n\n|Parameter|Proposed value (Ethereum)|Proposed value (Arbitrum)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|kinkUtilization1|65 (65%)|65 (65%)|\n|kinkUtilization2|70 (70%)|70 (70%)|\n|kinkRate1|1 (0.59%)|1 (0.59%)|\n|kinkRate2|4 (2.34%)|4 (2.34%)|\n|maxRate|225 (150%)|225 (150%)|\n|feeRatePercent|20 (20%)|20 (20%)|\n|minFeeRate|10 (0.50%)|10 (0.50%)|\n|maxFeeRate|160 (40%)|160 (40%)|\n\n# Remarks\n\n* We propose to treat tBTC more conservatively on Arbitrum than on Ethereum.\n\n  * tBTC is significantly more liquid on Ethereum.\n\n  * tBTC redemption can only occur on Ethereum (although it may be coming to Arbitrum in the near future).\n\n  * tBTC on Arbitrum does benefit from tBTC liquidity and redeemability on Ethereum due to fast tBTC bridging from Arbitrum to Ethereum via Wormhole. However, this extra step introduces risk and makes tBTC somewhat less attractive as collateral on Arbitrum.\n\n  * Much of the liquidity for tBTC on Arbitrum is being incentivized with $ARB that the Threshold team has received in a grant from Arbitrum. We can’t expect this incentivization to continue at the same rate in the medium-term, however the Threshold team has demonstrated a commitment to tBTC liquidity on Arbitrum and will continue to incentivize with their native token $T.\n\n* The oracle price deviation threshold (2%) is high for a volatile asset oracle. This is potentially problematic and could lead to significantly higher oracle price - market price deviations in times of volatility. For this reason, we propose using a wider liquidation discount of 6% vs. the 5% discount applied to wBTC.\n\n# Liquidity\n\nCurrent tBTC liquidity on Ethereum and Arbitrum:\n\n|Protocol|Chain|Pools|tBTC Liquidity|Non tBTC Liquidity|% of Non tBTC Liquidity|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Curve|Ethereum|tBTC/WBTC|$12,559,831.43|$13,637,952.36|52.06%|\n|Curve|Ethereum|TricryptoLLAMA|$1,660,276.10|$3,268,555.12|66.02%|\n|Uniswap|Ethereum|tBTC/WBTC|$887,621.73|$3,719,429.40|19.26%|\n|Curve|Arbitrum|2BTC-ng|$1,953,449.67|$2,128,851.59|52.15%|\n|Uniswap|Arbitrum|WBTC/tBTC|$1,259,239.52|$2,405,638.48|65.64%|\n|Uniswap|Arbitrum|tBTC/ETH|$218,054.25|$398,379.75|64.61%|\n|TOTAL|Ethereum|N/A|$15,107,728|$20,625,936|57.7%|\n|TOTAL|Arbitrum|N/A|$3,430,742|$4,932,868|59.0%|\n\n# Slippage\n\nCurrent slippage for tBTC sales on Ethereum and Arbitrum:\n\n|Trade Size (tBTC -> ETH)|Slippage (Ethereum)|Slippage (Arbitrum)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|1 tBTC|-0.15%|-0.1%|\n|10 tBTC|-0.24%|-0.2%|\n|50 tBTC|-0.50%|-0.6%|\n|75 tBTC|-0.55%|-11.00%|\n|100 tBTC|-0.60%|N/A|\n|250 tBTC|-2.50%|N/A|\n\n# Oracles\n\nProposed oracles on Ethereum and Arbitrum:\n\n|Network|Provider|Pair|Deviation|Address|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Ethereum|Chainlink|tBTC/USD|2%|0x8350b7De6a6a2C1368E7D4Bd968190e13E354297|\n|Arbitrum|Chainlink|tBTC/USD|0.5%|0xE808488e8627F6531bA79a13A9E0271B39abEb1C|\n\n# tBTC Redemption\n\ntBTC is redeemable for BTC via the Threshold protocol. tBTC redemption is currently live exclusively on Ethereum.\n\nImportant considerations:\n\n* Redemption is permissionless.\n\n* As long as the redemption mechanism is operational, we can be confident that traders holding wBTC or another BTC asset on Ethereum will arbitrage out any significant price tBTC price divergence.\n\n* Redemption time is 3-5 hours in normal times. Potentially longer in stress periods. This makes the tBTC purchase -> redemption for BTC -> BTC sale arbitrage loop somewhat risky, but we can still be confident that any significant tBTC depeg will be arbitraged away.\n\n# Smart contract risk\n\ntBTC V2 is well-audited, has an active bug bounty, and has been working live in production since 2021.\n\ntBTC technology has undergone three audits:\n\n* Least Authority (Sep 29 2022)\n  * https://leastauthority.com/blog/audits/audit-of-keep-network-tbtc-bridge-v2/\n* Chain Security (Nov 9 2021)\n  * https://www.chainsecurity.com/security-audit/threshold-network\n* Certik (Nov 19 2021)\n  * https://skynet.certik.com/projects/threshold-network\n\ntBTC has a $500,000 Bug Bounty with Immunefi:\n\n* https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/thresholdnetwork/information/\n\n# Future developments\n\nThe Threshold team has expressed plans to enable tBTC redemption on Arbitrum and increase on-chain liquidity for tBTC on the Arbitrum network. These developments could enhance the utility and attractiveness of tBTC as a collateral asset on Arbitrum.\n\nIf these enhancements are successfully implemented, we would intend to revisit this matter and issue a recommendation for more aggressive collateral parameters. This could include a reduction in the collateral haircut, an increase in the supply cap, and potentially more favorable liquidation discounts. These changes would align with the improved liquidity and reduced redemption risks, allowing for more efficient capital utilization within the Notional protocol.",

This has led to lower yields and borrow rates on competing lending protocols as well as significantly lower yields available to leveraged vault users on Notional.\n\nWe believe this suggests that we should lower kink2 rates on Notional’s variable rate lending markets significantly to bring them in line with the market and reduce the cost of borrowing such that leveraged yield strategies can remain profitable and we can achieve greater utilization on our lending markets.\n\nWe propose the following prime cash lending market parameters by token category, effective on both Mainnet and Arbitrum:\n\n|Parameters|ETH|Stablecoins|LSDs|wBTC|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|kinkUtilization1|75 (75%)|80 (80%)|70 (70%)|65 (65%)|\n|kinkUtilization2|80 (80%)|85 (85%)|75 (75%)|70 (70%)|\n|kinkRate1 (1/256)|3 (2.29%)|10 (3.93%)|2 (1.17%)|1 (0.59%)|\n|kinkRate2 (1/256)|8 (6.09%)|18 (7.07%)|5 (2.93%)|4 (2.34%)|\n|maxRate25BPS|255 (195%)|192 (100.5%)|225 (150%)|225 (150%)|\n|feeRatePercent|20 (20%)|20 (20%)|20 (20%)|20 (20%)|\n|minFeeRate5BPS|10 (0.50%)|10 (0.50%)|10 (0.50%)|10 (0.50%)|\n|maxFeeRate25BPS|160 (40%)|160 (40%)|160 (40%)|160 (40%)|\n\nThese changes represent a significant decrease in target prime cash interest rates. You can see the change from the current parameters here:\n\nKink rate changes Mainnet:\n\n|Parameters|ETH|Stablecoins|LSDs|wBTC|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|kinkRate1 (1/256)|7.62% -> 2.29%|9.96% -> 3.93%|4.1% -> 1.17%|1.76% -> 0.59%|\n|kinkRate2 (1/256)|25.14% -> 6.09%|29.88% -> 7.07%|16.41% -> 2.93%|3.52% -> 2.34%|\n\nKink rate changes Arbitrum:\n\n|Parameters|ETH|Stablecoins|LSDs|wBTC|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|kinkRate1 (1/256)|7.62% -> 2.29%|9.96% -> 3.93%|8.2% -> 1.17%|1.76% -> 0.59%|\n|kinkRate2 (1/256)|25.14% -> 6.09%|19.34% -> 7.07%|19.34% -> 2.93%|3.52% -> 2.34%|",

      "title": "[NIP-82] List a Balancer osETH/ETH leveraged vault (Arbitrum)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing an ETH Balancer [leveraged vault](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/leveraged-vaults/what-are-leveraged-vaults) on Notional V3 Arbitrum. The vault would allow users to borrow ETH from Notional’s Arbitrum deployment at a fixed or variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Balancer [ETH/osETH pool](https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x42f7cfc38dd1583ffda2e4f047f4f6fa06cefc7c000000000000000000000553) to earn pool rewards.\n\n# Proposal & parameters\n\nWe propose listing an ETH leveraged vault using the Balancer [ETH/osETH pool](https://balancer.fi/pools/arbitrum/v2/0x42f7cfc38dd1583ffda2e4f047f4f6fa06cefc7c000000000000000000000553) as a strategy. We propose listing that leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.03 (3%)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.13|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.23|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|500 ETH|\n|Minimum borrow size|2 ETH|\n|feeRate5BPS|20 (100 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|80%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|25%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|1.50%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Balancer ETH/osETH pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity up to 500 ETH to cap the maximum amount of ETH that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. In practice Notional governors will increase the maximum capacity of the vault in line with demand and ETH liquidity up to the 500 ETH maximum vault capacity threshold. We propose setting the maximum pool share at 25% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 25% of Balancer ETH/osETH pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 8.7X such that if a user deposits 1 ETH, he can at a maximum borrow 7.7 ETH from Notional to LP in the Balancer osETH/ETH pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in the pool’s token value. Setting the strategy's maximum leverage ratio at 8.7X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -8.85% in the pool's token value (ETH/osETH LP tokens) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (ETH). It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol against a decrease in the value of pool tokens relative to users' debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.23, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 5.3X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 8.7X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times in a short period of time.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 2 ETH and the vault liquidation discount at 3%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions (ex: high gas environment). To do so, a liquidator’s revenue from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 2 ETH and the liquidation discount at 3%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 0.06 ETH. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount is likely cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 1.0% such that borrowers will pay a 1.0% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves and 20% are paid to nETH holders.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.50%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool prices deviate from the oracle prices by more than 1.5%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure user can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Risks\n\n## Oracle\n\nWe propose using the Chronicle osETH/ETH oracle to check that the implied Balancer osETH/ETH pool price is in line with the overall market.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nosETH's primary liquidity venue on Arbitrum is this Balancer pool. This presents some illiquidity risk, but that risk is greatly mitigated by osETH liquidity on Ethereum which is several times larger than the liquidity on Arbitrum.\n\nosETH was deployed to Arbitrum using Wormhole, so fast bridging to Ethereum is available for the asset. This means that if the price of osETH declines on Arbitrum, users could arbitrage Arbitrum prices vs. Ethereum osETH liquidity. This greatly reduces the osETH illiquidity/liquidation risk for Notional on Arbitrum.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

The redemption time period could lead to the tBTC price decreasing against the WBTC price while redemptions are in progress. This would lead to a situation where the Curve tBTC/WBTC pool composition is made mostly of tBTC. In such a situation, it could be impossible to flash liquidate an account breaching the Notional’s maximum leverage ratio. By listing this leverage vault Notional implicitly accepts tBTC as a collateral asset.\n\nThe tBTC liquidity risk can be somewhat mitigated by capping the protocol’s exposure at 25% of the pool and by setting the maximum vault capacity in line with Notional’s WBTC liquidity.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "title": "[NIP-80] Reduce NOTE Emissions and Increase NOTE Buybacks",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nIn this post, we lay out a path forward to decrease NOTE emissions and increase buybacks over the next 12 months. Additionally we propose an immediate 20% cut to NOTE incentive emissions for liquidity providers on Notional V3.\n\n* We propose to gradually decrease NOTE incentive emissions from the current rate of 7.5M NOTE per year to 3M NOTE per year by August 1 2025.\n\n* We propose to increase the current rate of NOTE buybacks by turning on Notional’s external lending capabilities and using the revenue generated from that to directly fund NOTE buybacks.\n\n# NOTE incentive emissions\n\nWe propose to implement the following incentive emission decreases. The percentage decreases for specific currencies may vary at each date but the cut percentage in aggregate should conform to the below table:\n\n|Cut date|Cut percentage|New Emission Rate|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|August 1 2024|20%|6,000,000|\n|November 1 2024|20%|4,800,000|\n|February 1 2025|15%|4,080,000|\n|May 1 2025|15%|3,468,000|\n|August 1 2025|13%|3,000,000|\n\n# External lending\n\nExternal lending is the capability of the protocol to lend out assets sitting in Notional’s lending markets that are not currently utilized. For more background on external lending, see NIP-31.\n\nExternal lending has been approved but not yet activated. We propose to activate this functionality with a select number of tokens and use the revenues generated to fund NOTE buybacks.\n\nHere are example calculations showing the amount of revenue that external lending would generate for Notional today using ETH, USDC, and USDT on Ethereum and Arbitrum:\n\n|Token|Available to Lend At Utilization Target|Aave Rate|Annual Earnings|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|USDC (Mainnet)|$1,200,000|6.05%|$72,600|\n|ETH (Mainnet)|$1,500,000|1.90%|$28,500|\n|USDT (Mainnet)|$380,000|6.15%|$23,370|\n|USDC (Arbitrum)|$520,000|7.06%|$36,712|\n|ETH (Arbitrum)|$1,400,000|1.76%|$24,640|\n|USDT (Arbitrum)|$220,000|5.68%|$12,496|\n|Total|||$198,318|\n\nAs a note, the amount available to lend is determined by the amount of tokens which would need to be borrowed to move the variable lending market to kink2 utilization. We will always keep some amount of tokens on the Notional proxy contract to facilitate withdrawals and potential liquidations.\n\nThe dollar value of interest earned via external lending is highly variable and depends on Notional’s total TVL, the utilization of Notional’s lending markets, and the interest rates available on external lending protocols.\n\n# NOTE buyback projections\n\nToday, NOTE buybacks come from two places - protocol fee revenue and COMP sales. COMP sales will run out in 10 weeks. We intend for external lending revenues to replace and increase that buyback stream.\n\nIt’s difficult to project NOTE buyback rates because there is a lot of uncertainty around the growth of the protocol and because external lending revenues are not one to one correlated with protocol fee revenues. But here is a potential path of buyback rates over the next 12 months assuming that the protocol roughly doubles in size and fee revenue over that time from the ~$532k annualized revenue that the protocol generated in Q2:\n\n|Date|COMP Buyback Rate (annualized)|Fee Revenue Buyback Rate (annualized)|External Lending Buyback Rate (annualized)|Total Buyback Rate (annualized)|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|August 1 2024|$169,000|$100,000|0|$269,000|\n|November 1 2024|0|$100,000|$100,000|$200,000|\n|February 1 2025|0|$125,000|$200,000|$325,000|\n|May 1 2025|0|$150,000|$250,000|$400,000|\n|August 1 2025|0|$200,000|$300,000|$500,000|\n\n# NOTE net emission projections\n\nAs NOTE emissions fall and NOTE buybacks increase (hopefully), the net amount of NOTE emissions (NOTE emissions - NOTE buybacks) should steadily decrease.\n\nNet NOTE emissions will depend on the USD price of NOTE. But here is what net NOTE emissions would look like over the next 12 months using the assumed buyback rates and a $0.10 price for NOTE:\n\n|Date|NOTE Emissions|Buyback Rate|Buyback Rate (NOTE)|Net Emissions (NOTE)|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|August 1 2024|6,000,000|$269,000|2,690,000|3,310,000|\n|November 1 2024|4,800,000|$200,000|2,000,000|2,800,000|\n|February 1 2025|4,080,000|$325,000|3,250,000|830,000|\n|May 1 2025|3,468,000|$400,000|4,000,000|-532,000|\n|August 1 2025|3,000,000|$500,000|5,000,000|-2,000,000|\n\n# Initial 20% emission cut\n\nWe propose to cut NOTE emissions by 20% effective immediately upon passing snapshot per the following amounts:\n\n|Token|Current Emission Rate|New Emission Rate|Change|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|ETH (Arbitrum)|500,000|400,000|-100,000|\n|USDC (Arbitrum)|500,000|400,000|-100,000|\n|wstETH (Arbitrum)|100,000|0|-100,000|\n|rETH (Arbitrum)|100,000|0|-100,000|\n|USDT (Arbitrum)|300,000|200,000|-100,000|\n|ETH (Mainnet)|2,000,000|1,900,000|-100,000|\n|USDC (Mainnet)|2,500,000|2,350,000|-150,000|\n|rETH (Arbitrum)|500,000|0|-500,000|\n|USDT (Arbitrum)|1,000,000|750,000|-250,000|\n|Total|7,500,000|6,000,000|-1,500,000|",

      "title": "[NIP-79] List a Balancer rsETH/ETH leveraged vault (Arbitrum)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing an ETH Balancer [leveraged vault](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/leveraged-vaults/what-are-leveraged-vaults) on Notional V3 Arbitrum. The vault would allow users to borrow ETH from Notional’s Arbitrum deployment at a fixed or variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Aura boosted Balancer [rsETH/WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x58aadfb1afac0ad7fca1148f3cde6aedf5236b6d00000000000000000000067f) pool to earn pool rewards and points.\n\n# Proposal & parameters\n\nWe propose listing a ETH leveraged vault using the Balancer rsETH/WETH pool as a strategy. We propose listing that leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.03 (3%)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.14|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.27|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|250 ETH|\n|Minimum borrow size|2 ETH|\n|feeRate5BPS|20 (100 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|80%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|30%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|1.50%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Balancer rsETH/ETH pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity up to 250 ETH to cap the maximum amount of ETH that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. In practice Notional governors will increase the maximum capacity of the vault in line with demand and ETH liquidity up to the 250 ETH maximum vault capacity threshold. We propose setting the maximum pool share at 30% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 30% of balancer rsETH/ETH pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 8.1X such that if a user deposits 10 ETH, he can at a maximum borrow 71 ETH from Notional to LP in the Balancer rsETH/ETH pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in the pool’s token value. Setting the strategy’s maximum leverage ratio at 8.1X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -9.7% in the pool’s token value (rsETH/ETH BPTs) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (ETH). It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol against a decrease in the value of pool tokens relative to users’ debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.27, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 4.7X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 8.1X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times in a short period of time.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 2 ETH and the vault liquidation discount at 3%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions (ex: high gas environment). To do so, a liquidator’s revenue from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 2 ETH and the liquidation discount at 3%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 0.9 ETH. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount is likely to cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 1.0% such that borrowers will pay a 1.0% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves and 20% are paid to nETH holders.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.50%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool prices deviate from the oracle prices by more than 1.5%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure user can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Risks\n\n## Oracle\n\nWe propose using the Chainlink rsETH/ETH oracle and chainlink ETH oracle to check that the implied balancer rsETH/ETH pool price is in line with the overall market.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nrsETH is not very liquid on Arbitrum. The asset has roughly $8M in liquidity across Balancer, Uniswap, Camelot, and Ramses. These low levels of liquidity are mitigated by three facts:\n\n1. rsETH is redeemable on Mainnet.\n\n2. rsETH is significantly more liquid on Mainnet and has liquidity on other L2s.\n\n3. rsETH has fast bridging set up from Arbitrum to Mainnet.\n\nFast bridging means that the rsETH price on Arbitrum should remain very close to the price on Mainnet and should not significantly deviate for more than very short periods of time. The price on Mainnet should remain close to peg given that redemptions are enabled and that rsETH is relatively liquid on Mainnet. This all means that rsETH should remain tradable close to peg on Arbitrum.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

The vault would allow users to borrow ETH from Notional’s Mainnet deployment at a fixed or variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Aura boosted Balancer [rsETH/WETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x58aadfb1afac0ad7fca1148f3cde6aedf5236b6d00000000000000000000067f) pool to earn pool rewards and points.\n\n# Proposal & parameters\n\nWe propose listing a ETH leveraged vault using the Balancer rsETH/WETH pool as a strategy. We propose listing that leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.03 (3%)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.14|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.27|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|750 ETH|\n|Minimum borrow size|30 ETH|\n|feeRate5BPS|20 (100 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|80%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|20%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|1.50%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Balancer rsETH/ETH pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity up to 750 ETH to cap the maximum amount of ETH that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. In practice Notional governors will increase the maximum capacity of the vault in line with demand and ETH liquidity up to the 750 ETH maximum vault capacity threshold. We propose setting the maximum pool share at 20% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 20% of balancer rsETH/ETH pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 8.1X such that if a user deposits 10 ETH, he can at a maximum borrow 71 ETH from Notional to LP in the Balancer rsETH/ETH pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in the pool’s token value. Setting the strategy’s maximum leverage ratio at 8.1X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -9.7% in the pool’s token value (rsETH/ETH BPTs) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (ETH). It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol against a decrease in the value of pool tokens relative to users’ debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.27, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 4.7X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 8.1X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times in a short period of time.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 30 ETH and the vault liquidation discount at 3%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions (ex: high gas environment). To do so, a liquidator’s revenue from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 30 ETH and the liquidation discount at 3%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 0.9 ETH. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount is likely to cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 1.0% such that borrowers will pay a 1.0% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves and 20% are paid to nETH holders.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.50%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool prices deviate from the oracle prices by more than 1.5%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure user can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Risks\n\n## Oracle\n\nWe propose using the Chainlink rsETH/ETH oracle and chainlink ETH oracle to check that the implied balancer rsETH/ETH pool price is in line with the overall market.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nrsETH is moderately liquid on DEXes. The asset has roughly $50M in liquidity across Balancer and Uniswap. However, this liquidity is primarily denominated in rsETH and there is only $10M - $15M in ETH in these pools. This presents potential risks for liquidations.\n\nWe should note though that Kelp DAO has enabled redemptions for rsETH, so this redeemability should largely mitigate the risks of an rsETH depeg due to a lack of market liquidity. It’s still possible that rsETH is temporarily illiquid and unable to be liquidated, but given that this vault borrows ETH from Notional, the protocol can withstand holding the collateral against ETH debt for some period of time while redemptions are processed and rsETH returns to peg.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "content": "This proposal lays out a high-level framework for an ongoing process to manage exchange rate risks of Notional reserves and execute regular, weekly NOTE buybacks funded by protocol revenues.\n\n# NOTE buy and burn\n\nWe propose that governance commit to dedicating 20% of the protocol’s revenues to NOTE buybacks.\n\nEvery quarter, this percentage of fees across all tokens on all deployments would be converted to ETH and transferred to the Mainnet treasury manager. This ETH would then be used to fund regular, weekly purchases of NOTE such that all the ETH is used by the end of the quarter. Weekly ETH sales would be split between use as incentives for sNOTE holders and the buy and burn per a percentage agreed upon by governance.\n\nThis structure would imply that the protocol’s buyback rate would be somewhat backward-looking. For example, the buyback rate for April - June would be determined by the revenues earned in January - March.\n\n# Minimizing gas costs\n\nConverting all protocol fees to ETH and transferring them to a single contract on Mainnet will require a significant number of transactions and gas costs. By executing this operation only once a quarter, the protocol can keep this cost to a minimum.\n\nWe would also propose an additional caveat of a minimum trade size on Mainnet. If the amount of reserves in a certain token to be converted into ETH is less than $1,000 for example, we would propose to ignore these reserves and leave them in that token.\n\n# Managing exchange rate risk of reserves\n\nNotional accrues fees across a variety of different tokens, but its expenses are primarily denominated in USD, with a minority of expenses denominated in ETH. With this in mind, we believe that reserves should be periodically converted to USDC to match the protocol’s expenses with the caveat that we want to maintain some positive price exposure to ETH.\n\nSpecifically, this is how we believe accrued reserves should be handled by token.\n\n**ETH** - retain any accrued ETH reserves.\n**USDC** - retain any accrued USDC reserves.\n**LSDs / LRTs** - convert accrued reserves to ETH.\n**Stables ex USDC** - convert accrued reserves to USDC.\n**All other tokens** - convert accrued reserves to USDC.\n\n# Implementation Details\n\nThe next step will be to convert Notional V3 reserves to ETH and USDC per the above methodology and implement the recurring buybacks using the current percentage split between sNOTE and reinvestments and NOTE burns (75% burn, 25% sNOTE reinvestment).\n\nThe team will target implementation of this proposal such that processes are online to begin conducting buybacks per the agreed pace by the start of Q3 this year.\n\nFor V3 revenues accrued between Jan and March of 2024, they will be used to conduct buybacks during either the remainder of Q2 or for a minimum of 4 weeks, depending on when these buybacks begin.",

      "title": "[NIP-73] Increase max capacity on ETH/ezETH leveraged vault (Mainnet)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nDue to strong and sustained user demand, the utilization of the ETH / ezETH Balancer / Aura leveraged vault on Mainnet has reached 100%. To allow new users to enter the vault, we propose increasing the maximum vault capacity from 750 ETH to 1,500 ETH. We intend to progressively raise capacity limits in response to user demand.\n\n# ezETH Liquidity\n\nezETH still has not enabled withdrawals which makes offering highly leveraged strategies on ezETH risky. As Notional is unable to rely on withdrawals to facilitate liquidations or ensure peg stability, Notional needs to rely on secondary liquidity for ezETH.\n\nThere is significant secondary liquidity for ezETH on Mainnet, but the primary liquidity pool (the Balancer ETH/ezETH pool) is heavily skewed toward ezETH. Currently, the pool holds ~$98M in ezETH and ~$7M in ETH.\n\nHowever, this is not the only liquidity for ezETH. There is $168M sitting in an ezETH/ETH liquidity pool on Blast of which $38.8M is ETH. This puts total ETH currently backing ezETH in liquidity pools between $45M - $50M.\n\n# ezETH Withdrawals\n\nThe Renzo Protocol team has indicated that their withdrawal functionality is currently in audit and expected to complete by the end of May. Once this functionality is enabled, we can expect ezETH to quickly regain its peg. At this point, risks associated with a lack of secondary liquidity would be effectively neutralized.\n\nRealistically, we expect withdrawals to be enabled some time in mid-late June given guidance from the team as well as a reasonable buffer period to implement and test withdrawals post-audit.\n\nFor now, ezETH is trading at 0.98 to ETH. While another depeg prior to withdrawals being enabled is definitely possible, we think it is highly unlikely that ezETH would settle at a price less than 0.9 given that withdrawals are relatively close at hand.\n\n# Assessment\n\nWe think that on balance, the risks of increasing the capacity on this vault by the proposed amount are relatively low. Even at max capacity, this vault would hold a small fraction of the total ezETH liquidity just on Mainnet.\n\nThe relative size of positions in the vault vs. liquidity in the Balancer pool suggests that liquidations would be possible if necessary. The primary risk that Notional would run into is a sustained depeg at a price significantly below 0.9.\n\nWe think this situation is not likely to occur. Even if it did occur, the risk that it would cause insolvencies on Notional is low due to the conservative risk parameters implemented by the protocol on this vault (this vault implements a ~9.7% safety margin from the point of undercollateralization).\n\nGiven these factors, we believe this proposal is in the protocol’s best interests.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "title": "[NIP-72] - List a Curve USDe/USDC leveraged vault (Mainnet)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing a USDC Curve [leveraged vault](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/leveraged-vaults/what-are-leveraged-vaults) on Notional V3 Mainnet. The vault would allow users to borrow USDC from Notional’s Mainnet deployment at a fixed or variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Curve [USDC/USDe pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-stable-ng-12/deposit) to earn pool rewards.\n\n# Proposal & parameters\n\nWe propose listing a USDC leveraged vault using the Curve [USDC/USDe pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-stable-ng-12/deposit) as a strategy. We propose listing that leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.03 (3%)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.15|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.33|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|2,000,000 USDC|\n|Minimum borrow size|60,000 USDC|\n|feeRate5BPS|20 (100 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|80%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|20%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|1.50%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Curve USDC/USDe pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity up to 2,000,000 USDC to cap the maximum amount of USDC that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. In practice Notional governors will increase the maximum capacity of the vault in line with demand and USDC liquidity up to the 2,000,000 USDC maximum vault capacity threshold. We propose setting the maximum pool share at 20% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 20% of Curve USDC/USDe pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 7.7X such that if a user deposits 100,000 USDC, he can at a maximum borrow 670,000 USDC from Notional to LP in the Curve USDC/USDe pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in the pool’s token value. Setting the strategy's maximum leverage ratio at 7.7X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -10.4% in the pool's token value (USDC/USDe LP tokens) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (USDC). It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol against a decrease in the value of pool tokens relative to users' debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.33, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 4.0X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 7.7X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times in a short period of time.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 60,000 USDC and the vault liquidation discount at 3%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions (ex: high gas environment). To do so, a liquidator’s revenue from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 60,000 USDC and the liquidation discount at 3%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 1,800 USDC. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount is likely cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 1.0% such that borrowers will pay a 1.0% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves and 20% are paid to nUSDC holders.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.50%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool prices deviate from the oracle prices by more than 1.5%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure user can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Risks\n\n## Oracle\n\nWe propose using the Chainlink USDe and USDC oracles to check that the implied Curve pool exchange rate is in line with the overall market.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThere is a risk that USDe liquidity vs USDC decreases over time. In such a situation, it could be the case that it is impossible to flash liquidate an account breaching the Notional’s maximum leverage ratio. By listing this leverage vault Notional implicitly accepts USDe as a collateral asset.\n\nThe USDe liquidity risk can be somewhat mitigated by capping the protocol’s exposure at 20% of the pool and by setting the maximum vault capacity in line with Notional’s USDC liquidity.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

The vault would allow users to borrow WBTC from Notional’s Arbitrum deployment at a fixed or variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Convex boosted Curve [tBTC/WBTC pool](https://curve.convexfinance.com/stake/arbitrum/12) to earn pool rewards.\n\n# Proposal & parameters\n\nWe propose listing a WBTC leveraged vault using the Convex boosted Curve [tBTC/WBTC pool](https://curve.convexfinance.com/stake/arbitrum/12) as a strategy.

We propose setting the maximum vault capacity up to 6 WBTC to cap the maximum amount of WBTC that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. In practice Notional governors will increase the maximum capacity of the vault in line with demand and WBTC liquidity up to the 6 WBTC maximum vault capacity threshold. We propose setting the maximum pool share at 35% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 35% of Curve tBTC/WBTC pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 8.7X such that if a user deposits 0.10 WBTC, he can at a maximum borrow 0.77 WBTC from Notional to LP in the Curve tBTC/WBTC pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in the pool’s token value. Setting the strategy's maximum leverage ratio at 8.7X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -8.85% in the pool's token value (tBTC/WBTC LP tokens) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (WBTC). It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol against a decrease in the value of pool tokens relative to users' debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.23, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 5.3X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 8.7X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times in a short period of time.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 0.05 WBTC and the vault liquidation discount at 3%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions (ex: high gas environment). To do so, a liquidator’s revenue from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 0.05 WBTC and the liquidation discount at 3%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 0.0015 WBTC. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount is likely cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 1.0% such that borrowers will pay a 1.0% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves and 20% are paid to nWBTC holders.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.50%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool prices deviate from the oracle prices by more than 1.5%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure user can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Risks\n\n## Oracle\n\nWe propose using the Chainlink tBTC/USD oracle to check that the implied Curve tBTC/WBTC pool price is in line with the overall market.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThe tBTC redemption process by which tBTC can be redeemed for BTC can take up to [multiple hours](https://tbtcscan.com/redeems). The redemption time period could lead to the tBTC price decreasing against the WBTC price while redemptions are in progress. This would lead to a situation where the Curve tBTC/WBTC pool composition is made mostly of tBTC. In such a situation, it could be impossible to flash liquidate an account breaching the Notional’s maximum leverage ratio.

      "title": "[NIP-68] - List GHO as a collateral currency (Mainnet)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing GHO as a collateral currency on Notional V3 Mainnet. We propose listing GHO with its dedicated variable rate market as well as with 3 months and 6 months fixed rate markets. This listing would enable the following usecases for the growing GHO holder base:\n\n**GHO depositors**\n* Earn variable or fixed yield on GHO \n* Borrow other crypto assets against GHO \n\n**GHO borrowers**\n* Borrow GHO to enter whitelisted yield strategies\n  * LP in the Aura boosted Balancer USDC/GHO/USDT pool\n  * LP in the Convex boosted Curve crvUSD/GHO pool\n\nGHO is a stablecoin developed by the Aave DAO and was deployed in July 2023. The current GHO supply stands at $48M.\n\n# Proposed listing parameters\n\nWe propose listing GHO as a collateral currency with the following parameters.\n\n### Collateralization parameters\n\n|Parameter|Proposed value|\n| --- | --- |\n|Collateral Haircut|0.85|\n|Debt Buffer|1.11|\n|Liquidation Discount|1.05|\n\nThese parameters imply the following minimum collateral ratios for GHO:\n\n|Pair|Implied minimum collateral ratio|\n| --- | --- |\n|GHO collateral / USDC debt|128%|\n|USDC collateral / GHO debt|120%|\n\nBased on these parameters, the protocol will effectively be able to withstand a decrease of 18% in the GHO price once a position becomes undercollateralized. As liquidity develops and as GHO becomes more integrated across DeFi those parameters could be updated.\n\nThe 5% liquidation discount is set to cover liquidation gas costs, differences between the oracle price and the market price as well as slippage resulting from a liquidation.\n\nWe also propose listing GHO with an initial supply cap of $1M with the ability to increase the supply cap up to $5M over time as GHO demand increases and GHO liquidity develops.\n\n### Variable Interest Rate Model\n\nWe propose using the same variable interest rate model for GHO that the protocol uses for USDC. The first kink is set at 65% utilization at a rate of 10% and the second kink is set at 85% at a rate of 30%. As a reference the current GHO borrowing cost on Aave ranges between 9.72% and 13.88%.\n\n|Parameters|Values|\n| --- | --- |\n|kinkUtilization1|65%|\n|kinkUtilization2|85%|\n|kinkRate1 (1/256)|10%|\n|kinkRate2 (1/256)|30%|\n|maxRate25BPS|150.00%|\n|feeRatePercent|20.00%|\n|minFeeRate5BPS|0.50%|\n|maxFeeRate25BPS|40.00%|\n\n![|624x291](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/61Yf8z331a2js0hk0Fh6zS-TELUjCuJJ9L6MhQ71Tg7C4kaqRcayDGeNdvd3tR6FpZsh7rVoeBgrcK1FQYWoYX74SOeXBf7jYQhSUYD_ahnkNK12WS1GGy3wb2gj0-jxLBhWecW6gXCkzRHSr5vsXdQ \"Chart\")\n\n\n\n### Fixed Interest Rate Models\n\nWe propose using the following fixed interest rate models for GHO:\n\n|Parameters|Values (3 Month market)|Values (6 Month market)|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|kinkUtilization1|20%|20%|\n|kinkUtilization2|80%|80%|\n|kinkRate1 (1/256)|8%|8%|\n|kinkRate2 (1/256)|20%|20%|\n|maxRate25BPS|40%|40%|\n|feeRatePercent|8.00%|8.00%|\n|minFeeRate5BPS|0.15%|0.15%|\n|maxFeeRate25BPS|2.00%|2.00%|\n|Initial proportion|35.00%|35.00%|\n|Deposit share|60.00%|40.00%|\n|Leverage threshold|88.00%|88.00%|\n\n![|624x351](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/5ooiPqVEJNvxqkpfBPHog9_RerVrakNjx-qV1LNFDODTYADxTupSZzMhw6oAepEZOiVnq_dI6F5XUzXnJ2cmMrmwFoz1P5Akca5FKPwO5LZfvGHVjei9rIwHCpfV8Xx_dveVpbwU9qg6984S4uL-Isc \"Chart\")\n![|624x363](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/3z76gRpzbG7SbE0hD6INE1njYZJuVxL49QFFEtcI_K_RJXXYLFxkR6G4ZrxOilaFFLI6z9zp6hIVotyRqDBhWV3Io3bnWLYLItxw6-EpVPXsjj9un1XB-tE3GdGwl7Ns3LZNTdaiOa979-7EYmfNiIM \"Chart\")\n\n# Analysis\n\n### Volatility\n\nWe analyzed the historical oracle prices for GHO and looked at the historical volatility and maximum drawdowns to select appropriate collateral parameters.\n\n||Since inception|Last 30 days|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Min oracle price|$0.95275732|$0.99448302|\n|Max oracle price|$0.99881659|$0.99684391|\n|Oracle price volatility (1H)|0.07%|0.01%|\n|Oracle price volatility (24H)|0.25%|0.03%|\n|Max drawdown (1H)|-1.32%|-0.08%|\n|Max drawdown (24H)|-2.09%|-0.11%|\n\n### Liquidity\n\nWe analyzed the on-chain liquidity for GHO to better understand GHO’s liquidity profile.

Specifically, the update aims to raise the target variable interest rates. Furthermore, this proposal involves altering the configuration of the variable interest rate curves to ensure a more gradual increase in variable rates between the kink1 and kink2 utilization rates.\n\n# Prime Cash Interest Rate Models\n\nWe propose increasing the kink2 interest rates for all currencies. Increasing the optimal interest rates will facilitate the variable lending experience for suppliers. We also propose increasing kink2 utilization rates by 5% for ETH and LSDs. We propose setting the kink1 utilization rates 20% below the kink2 utilization rates for all currencies. This will likely dampen the volatility in variable interest rates as utilization changes.

      "title": "[NIP-65] List a Balancer ezETH/wstETH leveraged vault (Arbitrum)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing a wstETH [Aura](https://app.aura.finance/#/) [leveraged vault](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/leveraged-vaults/what-are-leveraged-vaults) on Notional V3 Arbitrum. The vault would allow users to borrow wstETH from Notional’s Arbitrum deployment at a fixed or variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Aura boosted Balancer [ezETH/wstETH pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xb61371ab661b1acec81c699854d2f911070c059e000000000000000000000516) to earn pool rewards.\n\n# Proposal & parameters\n\nWe propose listing a wstETH leveraged vault using the Aura boosted Balancer [ezETH/wstETH pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0xb61371ab661b1acec81c699854d2f911070c059e000000000000000000000516) as a strategy. We propose listing that leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.03 (3%)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.14|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.27|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|250 wstETH|\n|Minimum borrow size|2 wstETH|\n|feeRate5BPS|20 (100 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|80%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|30%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|1.50%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Balancer ezETH/wstETH pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity up to 250 wstETH to cap the maximum amount of wstETH that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. In practice Notional governors will increase the maximum capacity of the vault in line with demand and wstETH liquidity up to the 250 wstETH maximum vault capacity threshold. We propose setting the maximum pool share at 30% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 30% of balancer ezETH/wstETH pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 8.1X such that if a user deposits 10 wstETH, he can at a maximum borrow 71 wstETH from Notional to LP in the Balancer ezETH/wstETH pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in the pool’s token value. Setting the strategy's maximum leverage ratio at 8.1X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -9.7% in the pool's token value (ezETH/wstETH BPTs) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (wstETH). It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol against a decrease in the value of pool tokens relative to users' debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.27, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 4.7X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 8.1X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times in a short period of time.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 2 wstETH and the vault liquidation discount at 3%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions (ex: high gas environment). To do so, a liquidator’s revenue from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 2 wstETH and the liquidation discount at 3%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 0.06 wstETH. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount is likely cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 1.0% such that borrowers will pay a 1.0% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves and 20% are paid to nwstETH holders.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.50%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool prices deviate from the oracle prices by more than 1.5%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure user can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Risks\n\n## Oracle\n\nWe propose using the Chainlink ezETH/ETH oracle to check that the implied balancer ezETH/wstETH pool price is in line with the overall market.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nRenzo doesn’t currently allow ezETH holders to instantly redeem their ezETH for ETH. This could lead to a situation where the Balancer ezETH/wstETH pool composition is made mostly of ezETH. In such a situation, it would be impossible to flash liquidate an account breaching the Notional’s maximum leverage ratio. By listing this leverage vault Notional implicitly accepts ezETH as a collateral asset.\n\nThe ezETH liquidity risk can be somewhat mitigated by capping the protocol’s exposure at 30% of the pool and by setting the maximum vault capacity in line with Notional’s wstETH liquidity.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nDue to high demand for the recently launched USDC/GHO/USDT leveraged vault, we propose increasing the vault's maximum pool share parameter from 20% to 35%. The Notional leveraged vault currently holds 19.5% of the total amount of USDC/GHO/USDT Balancer Pool Tokens (BPTs). In order to allow new users to enter the vault we propose increasing the maximum pool share parameter to 35%.  \n\n# Risks \nIncreasing the maximum pool share implies that the protocol will accept a higher proportion of USDC/GHO/USDT BPTs as collateral.  The [USDC/GHO/USDT balancer pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x8353157092ed8be69a9df8f95af097bbf33cb2af0000000000000000000005d9) is currently $2.5M. By increasing the maximum pool share parameter to 35%, the protocol will allow users to hold up to $840K of the pool's BPTs as collateral assuming the pool size remains constant.\n\nA potential de-peg in USDT or GHO could adversely impact the vault. More specifically if liquidity for GHO decreases it could increase the amount of slippage vault users will experience when redeeming their positions. GHO on-chain liquidity is currently $21M with 33% of that liquidity being held in non-GHO stablecoins thereby mitigating potential liquidity concerns.\n\n\n\n# Resources\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "title": "[NIP-62] - List a Convex crvUSD/USDT leveraged vault (Arbitrum)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing a USDT [Convex](https://www.convexfinance.com/stake) [leveraged vault](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/leveraged-vaults/what-are-leveraged-vaults) on Notional V3 Arbitrum. The vault would allow users to borrow USDT from Notional’s Arbitrum deployment at a fixed or variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Convex boosted Curve [USDT/crvUSD pool](https://curve.fi/#/arbitrum/pools/factory-stable-ng-0/deposit) to earn pool rewards.\n\n# Proposal & parameters\n\nWe propose listing a USDT leveraged vault using the Convex boosted Curve [USDT/crvUSD pool](https://curve.fi/#/arbitrum/pools/factory-stable-ng-0/deposit) as a strategy. We propose listing that leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.03 (3%)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.14|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.26|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|2,000,000 USDT|\n|Minimum borrow size|5,000 USDT|\n|feeRate5BPS|20 (100 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|80%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|20%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|1.50%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Curve USDT/crvUSD pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity up to 2,000,000 USDC to cap the maximum amount of USDT that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. In practice Notional governors will increase the maximum capacity of the vault in line with demand and USDT liquidity up to the 2,000,000 USDC maximum vault capacity threshold. We propose setting the maximum pool share at 20% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 20% of Curve USDT/crvUSD pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 8.1X such that if a user deposits 10,000 USDT, he can at a maximum borrow 71,430 USDT from Notional to LP in the Curve USDT/crvUSD pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in the pool’s token value. Setting the strategy's maximum leverage ratio at 8.1X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -9.7% in the pool's token value (USDT/crvUSD LP tokens) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (USDT). It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol against a decrease in the value of pool tokens relative to users' debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.26, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 4.9X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 8.1X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times in a short period of time.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 5,000 USDT and the vault liquidation discount at 3%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions (ex: high gas environment). To do so, a liquidator’s revenue from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 5,000 USDT and the liquidation discount at 3%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 150 USDT. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount is likely cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 1.0% such that borrowers will pay a 1.0% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves and 20% are paid to nUSDT holders.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.50%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool prices deviate from the oracle prices by more than 1.5%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure user can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Risks\n\n## Oracle\n\nWe propose using the Chainlink crvUSD and USDT oracles to check that the implied Curve pool exchange rate is in line with the overall market.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThere is a risk that crvUSD liquidity vs USDT decreases over time. In such a situation, it could be the case that it is impossible to flash liquidate an account breaching the Notional’s maximum leverage ratio. By listing this leverage vault Notional implicitly accepts crvUSD as a collateral asset.\n\nThe crvUSD liquidity risk can be somewhat mitigated by capping the protocol’s exposure at 20% of the pool and by setting the maximum vault capacity in line with Notional’s USDT liquidity.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "title": "[NIP-58] Update Variable and Fixed Rate Interest Rate Models (Mainnet & Arbitrum)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nIn preparation for Notional’s upcoming quarterly roll occurring Wednesday, March 17th at 8:00 PM EST, we propose a set of parameter updates to Notional V3. More specifically, we propose updating the interest rate models to accommodate higher interest rates as borrow demand across DeFi has increased in recent weeks as highlighted by [MakerDAO’s increase of the DAI savings rate to 15%](https://vote.makerdao.com/executive/template-executive-vote-out-of-schedule-executive-vote-increase-edsr-increase-stability-fees-decrease-gsm-delay-usdc-psm-throughput-change-trigger-spark-proxy-spell-march-8-2024).\n\n# Prime Cash Interest Rate Models\n\nWe propose increasing the interest rates at target utilization rate (kinkUtilization2) for stablecoins markets from 11.8% to 14.1%. This will allow borrowers to borrow at higher variable rates without pushing utilization above kink2 utilization rates. This change will be applied on both Mainnet and Arbitrum.\n\n# fCash Interest Rate Models\n\nWe propose a set of parameters that will accommodate higher interest rates for Notional’s fixed rate markets. We propose setting the lower kink utilization rates (kinkUtilization1) at 50% and the higher kink utilization rates (kinkUtilization2) at 80%. Additionally, we propose setting the optimal interest rates (kinkRate2) higher.\n\nWe also propose setting leverage thresholds at 84% for all markets, setting deposit shares at 60% for the 3 month markets and 40% for the 6 month markets. We also propose setting the initial market proportions at 30%.\n\nThe proposed fCash interest rate models can be visualized [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uYRH3p0O0aYJsYI58IQQvGmJTVwPLY3AtoIs_D6_Pj0/edit#gid=1652050083). We propose these changes being applied to Arbitrum. We propose to only update the Mainnet stablecoin fixed rate IRMs.\n\n## 3 Month fCash markets\n\nIn the tables below we present the breakdown of the proposed parameter changes for 3M fCash markets:\n\n### Current parameters (3M fCash Markets)\n\n|Parameters|ETH|Stablecoins|Liquid Staking Derivatives|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|kinkUtilization1|15 (15%)|15 (15%)|25 (25%)|\n|kinkUtilization2|75 (75%)|80 (80%)|75 (75%)|\n|kinkRate1 (1/256)|27 (3.16%)|30 (3.52%)|6 (0.70%)|\n|kinkRate2 (1/256)|43 (5.04%)|51 (5.98%)|17 (1.99%)|\n|maxRate25BPS|120 (30%)|120 (30.00%)|120 (30.00%)|\n|minFeeRate5BPS|3 (0.15%)|3 (0.15%)|2 (0.10%)|\n|maxFeeRate25BPS|8 (2.00%)|8 (2.00%)|8 (2.00%)|\n|feeRatePercent|8 (8%)|8 (8.00%)|8 (8.00%)|\n|Initial proportion|50.00%|50.00%|50.00%|\n|Deposit share|55.00%|55.00%|50.00%|\n|Leverage threshold|75.00%|80.00%|75.00%|\n\n## Proposed parameters (3M fCash Markets)\n\n|Parameters|ETH|Stablecoins|Liquid Staking Derivatives|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|kinkUtilization1|**50 (50%)**|**50 (50%)**|**50 (50%)**|\n|kinkUtilization2|**80 (80%)**|**80 (80%)**|**80 (80%)**|\n|kinkRate1 (1/256)|**34 (3.98%)**|**45 (5.27%)**|**9 (1.05%)**|\n|kinkRate2 (1/256)|**70 (8.20%)**|**95 (11.13%)**|**34 (3.98%)**|\n|maxRate25BPS|120 (30%)|120 (30.00%)|120 (30.00%)|\n|minFeeRate5BPS|3 (0.15%)|3 (0.15%)|2 (0.10%)|\n|maxFeeRate25BPS|8 (2.00%)|8 (2.00%)|8 (2.00%)|\n|feeRatePercent|8 (8%)|8 (8.00%)|8 (8.00%)|\n|Initial proportion|**30.00%**|**30.00%**|**30.00%**|\n|Deposit share|**60.00%**|**60.00%**|**60.00%**|\n|Leverage threshold|**84.00%**|**84.00%**|**84.00%**|\n\n## 6 Month fCash markets\n\nIn the tables below we present the breakdown of the proposed parameter changes for 6M fCash markets:\n\n### Current parameters (6M fCash Markets)\n\n|Parameters|ETH|Stablecoins|Liquid Staking Derivatives|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|kinkUtilization1|15 (15%)|40 (40%)|25 (25%)|\n|kinkUtilization2|75 (75%)|80 (80%)|75 (75%)|\n|kinkRate1 (1/256)|10 (0.98%)|25 (2.44%)|4 (0.39%)|\n|kinkRate2 (1/256)|41 (4.00%)|51 (4.98%)|12 (1.17%)|\n|maxRate25BPS|100 (25.00%)|100 (25.00%)|100 (25.00%)|\n|minFeeRate5BPS|3 (0.15%)|3 (0.15%)|2 (0.10%)|\n|maxFeeRate25BPS|8 (2.00%)|8 (2.00%)|8 (2.00%)|\n|feeRatePercent|8 (8.00%)|8 (8.00%)|8 (8.00%)|\n|Initial proportion|40.00%|40.00%|40.00%|\n|Deposit share|45.00%|45.00%|50.00%|\n|Leverage threshold|60.00%|60.00%|60.00%|\n\n### Proposed parameters (6M fCash Markets)\n\n|Parameters|ETH|Stablecoins|Liquid Staking Derivatives|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|kinkUtilization1|**50 (50%)**|**50 (50%)**|**50 (50%)**|\n|kinkUtilization2|**80 (80%)**|**80 (80%)**|**80 (80%)**|\n|kinkRate1 (1/256)|**34 (3.98%)**|**54 (5.27%)**|**10 (0.98%)**|\n|kinkRate2 (1/256)|**75 (8.79%)**|**110 (10.74%)**|**41 (4.00%)**|\n|maxRate25BPS|120 (30%)|120 (30.00%)|120 (30.00%)|\n|minFeeRate5BPS|3 (0.15%)|3 (0.15%)|2 (0.10%)|\n|maxFeeRate25BPS|8 (2.00%)|8 (2.00%)|8 (2.00%)|\n|feeRatePercent|8 (8%)|8 (8.00%)|8 (8.00%)|\n|Initial proportion|**30.00%**|**30.00%**|**30.00%**|\n|Deposit share|**40.00%**|**40.00%**|**40.00%**|\n|Leverage threshold|**84.00%**|**84.00%**|**84.00%**|\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "title": "[NIP-57] - Update NOTE incentive rates (Mainnet & Arbitrum) ",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nAs part of launching Notional V3 on Mainnet, we propose updating NOTE incentive rates for both Mainnet and Arbitrum. Our proposal includes a phased reduction of NOTE incentives for Notional V2 mainnet, from an annual incentive rate of 10M to 0 while increasing the NOTE incentive rates for Notional V3 Mainnet to 6M NOTE annually. Additionally, we propose decreasing the NOTE incentive rates on Arbitrum from 2M to 1.5M per year.\n\n# Context and objective\n\nNotional V3 will go live on Mainnet on March 25th. As part of the V2 to V3 migration plan, Notional V2 incentives will be progressively turned off. In the meantime, we propose increasing V3 incentives to help bootstrap liquidity on Notional V3 and incentivize V2 users to migrate their positions.\n\n# Proposal\n\n## Notional V2\n\nWe propose to decrease incentives for Notional V2 according to the following schedule:\n\n| Currency | Current    | March 25th | April 1st | May 1st   | \n|----------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------|\n| ETH      | 2,000,000  | 1,000,000  | 200,000   | 0         |\n| DAI      | 2,500,000  | 1,250,000  | 500,000   | 0         | \n| USDC     | 5,500,000  | 2,750,000  | 1,100,000 | 0         | \n| WBTC     | 0          | 0          | 0         | 0         |\n| **Total**| **10,000,000**| **5,000,000**  | **1,800,000** |**0** | \n\nThis will incentivize Notional V2 users to migrate their positions to Notional V3 over the coming months. Reducing incentives for V2 is part of the plan to transition users from V2 to V3.\n\n## Notional V3\n\nWe propose allocating NOTE incentives on Notional V3 Mainnet and Arbitrum deployments according to the following schedule:\n\n| Currency | Mainnet (Current) | Arbitrum (Current) | Mainnet (Proposed) | Arbitrum (Proposed) |\n|----------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|\n| ETH      | 0                 | 500,000            | 2,000,000          | 500,000             |\n| DAI      | 0                 | 100,000            | 0                  | 0                   |\n| USDC     | 0                 | 500,000            | 2,500,000          | 500,000             |\n| WBTC     | 0                 | 100,000            | 0                  | 0                   |\n| wstETH   | 0                 | 200,000            | 0                  | 100,000             |\n| FRAX     | 0                 | 100,000            | 0                  | 0                   |\n| rETH     | 0                 | 200,000            | 500,000            | 100,000             |\n| USDT     | 0                 | 100,000            | 1,000,000          | 300,000             |\n| cbETH    | 0                 | 200,000            | 0                  | 0                   |\n| **Total**| **0**             | **2,000,000**      | **6,000,000**      | **1,500,000**       |\nMainnet and Arbitrum V3 incentives would be updated on March 25th.\n\n## Mainnet\n\nWe propose focussing the protocol’s incentive allocation to currencies with leveraged vault opportunities. For Notional V3 mainnet the following vaults have been approved by Notional’s governance:\n\n* **USDC**\n  * Convex pyUSD/USDC pool\n  * Convex crvUSD/USDT pool\n  * Aura USDT/GHO/USDC pool\n* **USDT**\n  * Convex crvUSD/USDT pool\n* **ETH**\n  * Aura osETH/WETH pool\n* **rETH**\n  * Aura rETH/weETH pool\n\nTherefore we propose allocating 42% of incentives to USDC, 33% to ETH, 17% to USDT, and 8% to rETH.\n\nAs part of this proposal, we also propose to start experimenting with allocating some incentives directly to leveraged vault strategies. In such cases the annual incentive rates for each currency would continue to be enforced but some of the incentives currently allocated to nTokens could be redirected to leveraged vault strategies. For example, if the USDC annual incentive rate on Arbitrum is 500,000, governors could allocate 100,000 NOTE to a USDC denominated vault and would continue incentivizing nUSDC with the remaining 400,000 NOTE.\n\n## Arbitrum\n\nWe propose to reallocate incentives to currencies with positive yielding leveraged vaults opportunities. Therefore we propose continuing to incentives ETH, USDC, wstETH, rETH, and USDT.\n\n# Resources\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "title": "[NIP-56] List a Balancer weETH/rETH leveraged vault (Mainnet)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing a rETH [Aura](https://app.aura.finance/#/) [leveraged vault](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/leveraged-vaults/what-are-leveraged-vaults) on Notional V3 Mainnet. The vault would allow users to borrow rETH from Notional’s Mainnet deployment at a fixed or variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Aura boosted Balancer [weETH/rETH pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x05ff47afada98a98982113758878f9a8b9fdda0a000000000000000000000645) to earn pool rewards and points.\n\n# Proposal & parameters\n\nWe propose listing a rETH leveraged vault using the Aura boosted Balancer [weETH/rETH pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x05ff47afada98a98982113758878f9a8b9fdda0a000000000000000000000645) as a strategy. We propose listing that leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.03 (3%)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.13|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.25|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|1,000 rETH|\n|Minimum borrow size|30 rETH|\n|feeRate5BPS|20 (100 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|80%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|20%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|1.50%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Balancer weETH/rETH pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity up to 1,000 rETH to cap the maximum amount of rETH that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. In practice Notional governors will increase the maximum capacity of the vault in line with demand and rETH liquidity up to the 1,000 rETH maximum vault capacity threshold. We propose setting the maximum pool share at 20% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 20% of balancer weETH/rETH pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 8.7X such that if a user deposits 100 rETH, he can at a maximum borrow 769 rETH from Notional to LP in the Balancer weETH/rETH pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in the pool’s token value. Setting the strategy's maximum leverage ratio at 8.7X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -8.9% in the pool's token value (weETH/rETH BPTs) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (rETH). It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol against a decrease in the value of pool tokens relative to users' debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.25, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 5.0X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 8.7X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times in a short period of time.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 30 rETH and the vault liquidation discount at 3%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions (ex: high gas environment). To do so, a liquidator’s revenue from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 30 rETH and the liquidation discount at 3%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 0.9 rETH. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount is likely cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 1.0% such that borrowers will pay a 1.0% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves and 20% are paid to nrETH holders.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.50%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool prices deviate from the oracle prices by more than 1.5%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure user can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Risks\n\n## Oracle\n\nWe propose using the Redstone [weETH/ETH oracle](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/weETH_FUNDAMENTAL) and chainlink rETH oracle to check that the implied balancer weETH/rETH pool price is in line with the overall market. \n\n## Liquidity\n\nEtherfi doesn’t currently allow weETH holders to instantly redeem their eETH for ETH. This could lead to a situation where the Balancer weETH/rETH pool composition is made mostly of weETH. In such a situation, it would be impossible to flash liquidate an account breaching the Notional’s maximum leverage ratio. By listing this leverage vault Notional implicitly accepts weETH as a collateral asset with its liquidity profile.\n\nThe weETH liquidity risk can be somewhat mitigated by capping the protocol’s exposure at 20% of the pool and by setting the maximum vault capacity in line with Notional’s rETH liquidity.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing a ETH [Aura](https://app.aura.finance/#/) [leveraged vault](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/leveraged-vaults/what-are-leveraged-vaults) on Notional V3 Mainnet. The vault would allow users to borrow ETH from Notional’s Mainnet deployment at a fixed or variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Aura boosted Balancer [osETH/WETH pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xdacf5fa19b1f720111609043ac67a9818262850c000000000000000000000635) to earn pool rewards.\n\n# Proposal & parameters\n\nWe propose listing a ETH leveraged vault using the Aura boosted Balancer [osETH/WETH pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0xdacf5fa19b1f720111609043ac67a9818262850c000000000000000000000635) as a strategy. We propose listing that leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.03 (3%)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.14|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.26|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|4,000 ETH|\n|Minimum borrow size|30 ETH|\n|feeRate5BPS|15 (75 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|80%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|20%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|1.50%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Balancer osETH/WETH pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity up to 4,000 ETH to cap the maximum amount of ETH that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. In practice, Notional governors will increase the maximum capacity of the vault in line with demand and ETH liquidity up to the 4,000 ETH maximum vault capacity threshold. We propose setting the maximum pool share at 20% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 20% of Balancer osETH/WETH pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 8.1X such that if a user deposits 100 ETH, he can at a maximum borrow 714 ETH from Notional to LP in the Balancer osETH/WETH pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in the pool’s token value. Setting the strategy's maximum leverage ratio at 8.1X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -9.7% in the pool's token value (osETH/WETH BPTs) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (ETH). It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol against a decrease in the value of pool tokens relative to users' debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.26, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 4.8X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 8.1X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times in a short period of time.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 30 ETH and the vault liquidation discount at 3%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions (ex: high gas environment). To do so, a liquidator’s revenue from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 30 ETH and the liquidation discount at 3%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 0.9 ETH. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount is likely cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 0.75% such that borrowers will pay a 0.75% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves and 20% are paid to nETH holders.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.50%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool prices deviate from the oracle prices by more than 1.5%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure user can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Risks\n\n## Oracle\n\nWe propose using the Redstone [osETH/ETH oracle](https://app.redstone.finance/#/app/token/osETH%5CETH) to check that the implied balancer osETH/ETH pool price is in line with the overall market.\n\n## Liquidity\n\n[osETH redemptions](https://stakewise.medium.com/a-deep-dive-into-oseth-the-new-lst-of-stakewise-v3-part-2-6388816bd40a) are not currently enabled such that only osETH minters are able to redeem osETH and natively unstake. It is currently not possible for a user to purchase osETH from the secondary market and redeem it. This could lead to a situation where the Balancer osETH/WETH pool composition is made mostly of osETH. In such a situation, it would be impossible to flash liquidate an account breaching the Notional’s maximum leverage ratio. By listing this leverage vault Notional implicitly accepts osETH as a collateral asset with its liquidity profile.\n\nThe osETH liquidity risk can be somewhat mitigated by capping the protocol’s exposure at 20% of the pool and by setting the maximum vault capacity in line with Notional’s ETH liquidity. Let's also note that the vault parameters could be updated when Stakewise implements osETH redemptions.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "title": "[NIP-53] List a Curve USDC/crvUSD leveraged vault (Mainnet)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing a USDC [Convex](https://www.convexfinance.com/stake) [leveraged vault](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/leveraged-vaults/what-are-leveraged-vaults) on Notional V3 Mainnet. The vault would allow users to borrow USDC from Notional’s Mainnet deployment at a fixed or variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Convex boosted Curve [USDC/crvUSD pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crvusd-0/deposit) to earn pool rewards.\n\n# Proposal & parameters\n\nWe propose listing a USDC leveraged vault using the Convex boosted Curve [USDC/crvUSD pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-crvusd-0/deposit) as a strategy. We propose listing that leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.03 (3%)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.14|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.26|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|5,000,000 USDC|\n|Minimum borrow size|100,000 USDC|\n|feeRate5BPS|20 (100 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|80%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|20%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|1.50%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Curve USDC/crvUSD pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity up to 5,000,000 USDC to cap the maximum amount of USDC that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. In practice Notional governors will increase the maximum capacity of the vault in line with demand and USDC liquidity up to the 5,000,000 USDC maximum vault capacity threshold. We propose setting the maximum pool share at 20% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 20% of Curve USDC/crvUSD pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 8.1X such that if a user deposits 100,000 USDC, he can at a maximum borrow 714,300 USDC from Notional to LP in the Curve USDC/crvUSD pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in the pool’s token value. Setting the strategy's maximum leverage ratio at 8.1X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -9.7% in the pool's token value (USDC/crvUSD LP tokens) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (USDC). It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol against a decrease in the value of pool tokens relative to users' debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.26, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 4.9X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 8.1X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times in a short period of time.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 100,000 USDC and the vault liquidation discount at 3%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions (ex: high gas environment). To do so, a liquidator’s revenue from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 100,000 USDC and the liquidation discount at 3%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 3,000 USDC. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount is likely cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 1.0% such that borrowers will pay a 1.0% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves and 20% are paid to nUSDC holders.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.50%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool prices deviate from the oracle prices by more than 1.5%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure user can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Risks\n\n## Oracle\n\nWe propose using the Chainlink crvUSD and USDC oracles to check that the implied Curve pool exchange rate is in line with the overall market.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThere is a risk that crvUSD liquidity decreases over time. In such a situation, it could be the case that it is impossible to flash liquidate an account breaching the Notional’s maximum leverage ratio. By listing this leverage vault Notional implicitly accepts crvUSD as a collateral asset.\n\nThe crvUSD liquidity risk can be somewhat mitigated by capping the protocol’s exposure at 20% of the pool and by setting the maximum vault capacity in line with Notional’s USDC liquidity.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "title": "[NIP-49] - Deploy/Migrate Notional V3 on Mainnet",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nFollowing the successful launch of Notional V3 on Arbitrum in November 2023, we want to poll the community to decide if the DAO should migrate Notional V2 mainnet deployment to V3 or if it should deprecate Notional V2 and deploy Notional V3 in parallel.\n\n# Context & objectives\n\nThe Notional V3 codebase offers various key improvement compared to V2:\n\n* Addition of Variable Rate Borrowing & Lending Markets allowing users to borrow and lend at variable rates. When fixed rate loans mature they simply convert to a variable rate loan simplifying the user experience.\n* Improved Fixed Rate Interest Rate Models allowing for higher capital efficiency and more effective risk management.\n* Addition of Supply & Borrow Caps to support the listing of a broader set of assets.\n* Leveraged Interest Rate Trading for users to borrow at a fixed rate and lend at a variable rate or vice versa with leverage while remaining delta neutral.\n* Leveraged Vault Trading for users to borrow fixed or variable to enter whitelisted yield strategies (e.g. Convex or Aura) with leverage.\n* External lending where unutilized funds are lent to external venues (ex: Aave V3) to increase capital efficiency.\n\nThe Notional V3 contracts have been audited by Sherlock over the following audits:\n\n* [Notional V3 audit - Sherlock](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/59)\n* [Notional V3 external lending & wrapped fCash audit - Sherlock](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/142)\n* [Notional V3 leveraged vault audit - Sherlock](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/119)\n\nWhen deciding on the migration path from Notional V2 to V3 the DAO should consider the following objectives:\n\n* Security of user funds\n* User experience (UX)\n* Liquidity preservation\n\n# Proposals\n\nWe propose the DAO with two alternative paths regarding the deployment/migration to Notional V3 on Mainnet:\n\n### Path #1 - In-place Migration from Notional V2 to V3\n\nThis path involves the Notional core team migrating the protocol and all user positions from Notional V2 to Notional V3.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n* Liquidity preservation (The entirety of Notional V2 liquidity migrates to Notional V3);\n* Simple UX for users (All user positions are migrated in-place, gas free for users).\n\n**Cons**:\n\n* Migration risk (Additional smart contracts risk and increased risk of loss of user funds);\n* Additional tests need to be conducted before the migration which could delay the migration;\n* Users don’t implicitly accept the migration from V2 to V3;\n* Continue supporting longer dated Notional V2 markets (ex: 1 Year USDC and DAI markets).\n\n### Path #2 - Deprecate V2 and deploy a new instance of Notional V3\n\nThis path involves winding down Notional V2 and deploying a new instance of Notional V3 on mainnet.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n* No migration related smart contract risks;\n* Users explicitly accept to migrate from V2 smart contracts to V3 smart contracts;\n* V3 contracts can be deployed as soon as the DAO votes on the protocol’s initial deployment parameters;\n* Get rid of Notional V2 longer dated markets (1 Year markets) at deployment.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n* Worse UX (Need to create a UI for existing users to migrate their positions from Notional V2 to Notional V3, additional gas fees for users);\n* Borrowers will be forcibly liquidated if they don’t repay their debts by the deadline.\n* Requires maintaining the Notional V2 UI to let users withdraw/migrate;\n* Liquidity fragmentation (some funds might indefinitely remain on V2 and never migrate to V3).\n* Will require attention from the team for a prolonged period of time.\n\n# Tentative V2 deprecation timeline\n\n* Feb 12th -> Disable borrowing on the Notional V2 UI\n* Mar 7th -> Reduce V2 incentives by 50%\n* Mar 17th -> Deprecate 1Y and 6M markets on the Notional V2 UI\n* Mar 17th -> Reduce V2 incentives to 0\n* Mar 17th -> Increase collateral requirements for borrowers\n* June 1 -> Swap V2 borrowers into variable rate borrow positions on Notional V3 by the June 1st deadline.\n* Dec 12 -> Fully deprecate fixed rate lending and borrowing on the Notional V2 UI. Only allow liquidity withdrawals.\n\n# Recommendation\n\nDeprecating V2 will involve degraded UX for users.  Depositors may see temporary illiquidity and delays in their ability to withdraw for up to 3 months.\n\nSwapping V2 borrowers into variable rate borrow positions on Notional V3 by the June deadline would involve moving borrower’s assets into a smart contract that is owned by their address so that they would be able to withdraw or manage their position however they want after the fact. This plan involves forcing borrowers to use V3 instead of V2 after the June deadline which we believe is a better than force-liquidating borrowers over time.\n\nDeprecating will also result in less liquidity retention. There are things we can do to minimize liquidity loss over the migration (like making it easy to migrate from V2 to V3, migrating incentives from V2 to V3, etc), but some liquidity loss is inevitable.\n\nHowever, we believe that deprecating is the safer option. A protocol upgrade is risky. We can test it, but it’s always possible that a complex upgrade will result in a bug. Furthermore, a fresh deployment of Notional V3 would enable us to get Notional V3 live on Mainnet quicker than if we chose to upgrade because we wouldn’t need to perform exhaustive upfront testing like we would with the upgrade.\n\nFor these reasons, we believe that deprecating V2 is the better option despite the drawbacks related to poor UX and liquidity fragmentation.\n\nThat said, both options are workable and we look forward to the community’s input.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V2 analytics dashboad](https://info.notional.finance/)\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "title": "[NIP-45] List a Balancer 4Pool USDT leverage vault (Arbitrum)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing a USDT [Aura](https://app.aura.finance/#/) [leveraged vault](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/leveraged-vaults/what-are-leveraged-vaults) on Notional V3 Arbitrum. The vault would allow users to borrow USDT from Notional’s Arbitrum deployment at a fixed or variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Aura boosted Balancer [USDC/USDC.e/USDT/DAI pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x423a1323c871abc9d89eb06855bf5347048fc4a5000000000000000000000496) to earn pool rewards.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe propose listing a USDT leveraged vault using the Aura boosted Balancer [USDC/USDC.e/USDT/DAI pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x423a1323c871abc9d89eb06855bf5347048fc4a5000000000000000000000496) as a strategy. We propose listing that leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.02 (2%)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.11|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.17|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|300,000 USDT|\n|Minimum borrow size|5,000 USDT|\n|feeRate5BPS|10 (50 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|80%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|20%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|1.00%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Balancer USDC/USDC.e/USDT/DAI pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity at 300,000 USDT to cap the maximum amount of USDT that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. Additionally, we propose setting the maximum pool share at 20% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 20% of balancer USDC/USDC.e/USDT/DAI pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 10X such that if a user deposits 10,000 USDT, he can at a maximum borrow 90,000 USDT from Notional to LP in the Balancer 4 token pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in the pool’s token value. Setting the strategy's maximum leverage ratio at 10X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -8.1% in the pool's token value (4 pool BPTs) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (USDT). Historically, the pool’s individual token worst maximum drawdown over a 1 hour period was -3.7% and -10.5% over a 24H period. It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol and that it is unlikely that the value of pool tokens will decline by such a magnitude relative to users' debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.17, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 6.9X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 10X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times in a short period of time.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 5,000 USDT and the vault liquidation discount at 2%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions. To do so, a liquidator’s revenue from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 5,000 USDT and the liquidation discount at 2%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 40 USDT. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount will likely cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 0.50% such that borrowers will pay a 0.50% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves and 20% are paid to nUSDT holders.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.00%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool prices deviate from the oracle prices by more than 1%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure user can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Resources\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "title": "[NIP-44] List a Balancer 4Pool DAI leverage vault (Arbitrum)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing a DAI [Aura](https://app.aura.finance/#/) [leveraged vault](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/leveraged-vaults/what-are-leveraged-vaults) on Notional V3 Arbitrum. The vault would allow users to borrow DAI from Notional’s Arbitrum deployment at a fixed or variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Aura boosted Balancer [USDC/USDC.e/USDT/DAI pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x423a1323c871abc9d89eb06855bf5347048fc4a5000000000000000000000496) to earn pool rewards.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe propose listing a DAI leveraged vault using the Aura boosted Balancer [USDC/USDC.e/USDT/DAI pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x423a1323c871abc9d89eb06855bf5347048fc4a5000000000000000000000496) as a strategy. We propose listing that leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.02 (2%)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.11|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.17|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|300,000 DAI|\n|Minimum borrow size|5,000 DAI|\n|feeRate5BPS|10 (50 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|80%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|20%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|1.00%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Balancer USDC/USDC.e/USDT/DAI pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity at 300,000 DAI to cap the maximum amount of DAI that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. Additionally, we propose setting the maximum pool share at 20% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 20% of balancer USDC/USDC.e/USDT/DAI pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 10X such that if a user deposits 10,000 DAI, he can at a maximum borrow 90,000 DAI from Notional to LP in the Balancer 4 token pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in the pool’s token value. Setting the strategy's maximum leverage ratio at 10X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -8.1% in the pool's token value (4 pool BPTs) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (DAI). Historically, the pool’s individual token worst maximum drawdown over a 1 hour period was -3.7% and -10.5% over a 24H period. It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol and that it is unlikely that the value of pool tokens will decline by such a magnitude relative to users' debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.17, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 6.9X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 10X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times in a short period of time.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 5,000 DAI and the vault liquidation discount at 2%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions. To do so, a liquidator’s revenue from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 5,000 DAI and the liquidation discount at 2%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 40 DAI. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount will likely cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 0.50% such that borrowers will pay a 0.50% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves and 20% are paid to nDAI holders.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.00%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool prices deviate from the oracle prices by more than 1%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure user can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Resources\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

To allow new users to enter the vault, we propose increasing the maximum vault capacity from 300,000 USDC to 750,000 USDC.\n\n# Proposal\n\nSince the leveraged vault utilization is currently at 100%, we propose increasing the maximum vault capacity from 300,000 USDC to 750,000 USDC.\n\nThe proposed vault capacity (750,000 USDC) represents approximately 12% of the strategy’s underlying Balancer pool TVL which currently sits at $6.3M. By capping the vault at a relatively small percentage of the [Balancer pool TVL](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x423a1323c871abc9d89eb06855bf5347048fc4a5000000000000000000000496) the protocol mitigates the vault’s redemption risk (i.e. maximizing the likelihood that users can easily exit from the Balancer pool to repay their USDC borrow without incurring too much slippage).\n\nAdditionally, Notional’s Prime USDC liquidity has increased drastically from [375,000 to 3,650,000](https://dune.com/queries/2687753/4469830) partly due to the launch of Notional’s ARB rewards for LPs.

The vault would allow users to borrow USDT from Notional’s Arbitrum deployment at a fixed or variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Convex boosted Curve USDC.e/USDT pool to earn rewards.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe propose listing a USDT leveraged vault using the Convex boosted Curve USDC.e/USDT pool as a strategy. We propose listing the USDT leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.02 (2%)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.13|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.19|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|300,000 USDT|\n|Minimum borrow size|5,000 USDT|\n|feeRate5BPS|10 (50 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|80%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|20%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|1.00%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Convex USDC.e/USDT liquidity pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity at 300,000 USDT to cap the maximum amount of USDT that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. Additionally, we propose setting the maximum pool share at 20% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 20% of Curve’s USDC.e/USDT liquidity pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 8.7X such that if a user deposits 10,000 USDT, he can at a maximum borrow 77,000 USDT from Notional to LP in the Curve pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in the pool’s token value. Setting the strategy's maximum leverage ratio at 10X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -9.72% in the pool's token value relative to the vault’s borrow currency (USDT). Historically, the USDC/USDT worst maximum drawdown over a 1 hour period was -4.3% and -12.2% over a 24H period. It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol and that it is unlikely that the value of pool tokens will decline by such a magnitude relative to users' debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.19, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 6.3X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 8.7X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times in a short period of time.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 5,000 USDT and the vault liquidation discount at 2%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions. To do so, a liquidator’s revenue from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 5,000 USDT and the liquidation discount at 2%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 40 USDT. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount will likely cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 0.50% such that borrowers will pay a 0.50% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves and 20% are paid to nUSDT holders.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.00%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool prices deviate from the oracle prices by more than 1%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure user can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Resources\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "title": "[NIP -42] Update Prime Cash interest rate models (Arbitrum)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nIn anticipation of the launch of ARB incentives on Notional V3 Arbitrum, we propose a set of parameter updates to increase the capital efficiency and utilization of the protocol’s variable rate markets. More specifically, we propose to increase the target interest rates in anticipation of higher borrowing demand. Additionally we propose updating the variable interest rate curves such that the variable rates increase more gradually before hitting the Kink2 utilization rate.\n\n# Prime Cash Interest Rate Models\n\nWe propose keeping kink2 utilization rates identical but increasing the kink1 utilization rates to 5% below the kink2 utilization rates. We also propose setting the current kinkRate2 rates as the new kinkRate1 rates. This will effectively shift the current target interest rates to utilization rates that are 5% lower than they currently are.\n\nThe proposed Prime Cash interest rate models can be visualized [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KfDAz-V8lwavmQFM2bCe9lPkBDPLtbiV2cy-_A3iRDM/edit#gid=1450856239).

      "content": "**Summary**\nProposal to implement buy and burn of NOTE Tokens\n\n**Context**\nNOTE tokens are emitted from the treasury to reward nToken holders for providing liquidity in vaults and its utility limited to governance and LP staking.\n\nCurrently a portion of the treasury funds are added to the Balancer NOTE/WETH pool and sNOTE received is then distributed to the liquidity providers as rewards.\n\nThe LP rewards started out in Q2 2022 however since then we have seen an overall decline in the market impacting the price significantly. During this time the IL suffered by LPs would have been higher then the rewards received. The NOTE token holders involved actively in the governance have also been impacted severely.\n\nThe number of NOTE tokens in the Balancer pool has increased from 3mn(a few days after the start of LP) to 14.9mn as of today which is currently 33% of the total circulating supply.\n\nThe current mechanism of reinvestment of treasury funds into the pool strengthens it temporarily. The sNOTE received can eventually be converted to NOTE/ETH and then dumped into the market. This entire process becomes a zero sum game and adds no real value to the eco system.\n\n**Proposal**\nA portion of the funds that is being rewarded to stakers should be re-allocated to buy and burn the NOTE token.\nFor e.g. if earlier 1 ETH was being provided as rewards to stakers every week and if community agrees to utilize 50% of rewards for buy and burn then only 0.5 ETH should be rewarded to stakers and the remaining 0.5 ETH should be used buy and burn NOTE tokens from the pool.\n\n**Advantages**\n- Adds deflationary aspect to the tokenomics.\n- Incentivizes holders of the NOTE actively involved in the governance.\n- Incentivizes long term stakers who have witnessed a significant IL.\n\n**Disadvantages**\n- The rewards to LP would be reduced by 50%\n- Affect the NOTE liquidity if LPs withdraw due to lower rewards\n\n**Additional Details**\nDuration - Buy & Burn is done using funds from reinvestment program . Hence , till the time reinvestment program is active the buy and burn should be active as well.\n\nTiming & Mode of Execution - Team to decide based on minimum dev work as they see fit\n\nOptions - 4 options to be considered for voting.\nThe template of following options - % reinvestment funds to be used for buy & burn , % reinvestment funds to be used for staking\n\n- 75% Buy & Burn , 25% Reward to Stakers\n- 50% Buy & Burn , 50% Reward to Stakers\n- 25% Buy & Burn , 75% Reward to Stakers\n- 0% Buy & Burn , 100% Reward to Stakers (For those who want to vote but interested in maintaining status quo)",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing a RDNT [Aura](https://app.aura.finance/#/) [leveraged vault](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/leveraged-vaults/what-are-leveraged-vaults) on Notional V3 Arbitrum. The vault would allow users to borrow RDNT from Notional’s Arbitrum deployment at a variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Aura boosted [Balancer RDNT/WETH pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x32df62dc3aed2cd6224193052ce665dc181658410002000000000000000003bd) to earn yield.\n\n# Context and objectives\n\nAs part of growing Notional V3, it is important that the DAO explores how it can offer attractive yield opportunities to Notional’s non-US users. Such opportunities will likely increase borrowing activity on Notional and therefore increase rates at which lenders can lend. The RDNT/WETH Aura boosted Balancer pool on Arbitrum has been[ yielding on average 25% over the past 30 days](https://app.aura.finance/#/42161/pool/1). The Balancer pool currently holds $64M in TVL.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe propose listing a RDNT leveraged vault using the Aura boosted [Balancer RDNT/WETH pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x32df62dc3aed2cd6224193052ce665dc181658410002000000000000000003bd) as a strategy. We propose listing that leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.03 (3% discount)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.12|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.20|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|500,000 RDNT|\n|Minimum borrow size|15,000 RDNT|\n|feeRate5BPS|40 (200 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|100%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|5%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|2.00%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Balancer RDNT/WETH pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity at 500,000 RDNT to cap the maximum amount of RDNT that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. Additionally, we propose setting the maximum pool share at 5% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 5% of the balancer pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 9.3X such that if a user deposits 10,000 RDNT, he can at a maximum borrow 83,500 RDNT from Notional to LP in the Balancer token pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in RDNT/WETH pool token value. Historically the WETH/RDNT market exchange rate has varied by a maximum of 14.3% over a 24H period. Such an increase in the price of RDNT would translate to a loss of -2.64% in the value of WETH/RDNT BPTs. Setting the strategy's maximum leverage ratio at 9.3X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -8.9% in pool token value (RDNT/WETH BPTs) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (RDNT). A decrease of -8.9% in the value of BPTs corresponds to a decrease of -37% in the RDNT/ETH exchange rate (ex: RNDT increases by 60% vs ETH or ETH decreases 37% vs RDNT). It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol and that it is unlikely that the value of pool tokens will decline by such a magnitude relative to users’ debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.20, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 6X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 9.3X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times over a short time period.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 15,000 RDNT and the vault liquidation discount at 3%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions. To do so, a liquidator’s revenues from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 15,000 RDNT and the liquidation discount at 3%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 450 RDNT. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount will likely cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 2% such that borrowers will pay a 2% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 100% such that 100% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 2.00%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool price deviates from the oracle price by more than 2%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure users can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose listing a ETH [Aura](https://app.aura.finance/#/) [leveraged vault](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/leveraged-vaults/what-are-leveraged-vaults) on Notional V3 Arbitrum. The vault would allow users to borrow ETH from Notional’s Arbitrum deployment at a fixed or variable rate and LP the proceeds in the Aura boosted [Balancer wstETH/WETH pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/arbitrum/pool/0x9791d590788598535278552eecd4b211bfc790cb000000000000000000000498) to earn yield.\n\n# Context and objectives\n\nAs part of growing Notional V3, it is important that the DAO explores how it can offer attractive yield opportunities to Notional’s non-US users. Such opportunities will likely increase borrowing activity on Notional and therefore increase rates at which lenders can lend. The [wstETH/WETH Aura boosted Balancer pool](https://app.aura.finance/#/42161/pool/29) on Arbitrum has been yielding on average 6% over the past 30 days. The Balancer pool currently holds $4.7M in TVL.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe propose listing a ETH leveraged vault using the Aura boosted Balancer wstETH/WETH pool as a strategy. We propose listing that leveraged vault strategy with the following parameters:\n\n|Vault Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|LiquidationRate|1.02 (2% discount)|\n|MinCollateralRatioBPS|0.10|\n|MaxDevelerageCollateralRatioBPS|0.17|\n|MaxRequiredAccountCollateralRatioBPS|1.00|\n|Maximum vault capacity|100 ETH|\n|Minimum borrow size|2 ETH|\n|feeRate5BPS|10 (50 BPS)|\n|ReserveFeeShare|80%|\n\n|Strategy Parameters|Proposed Value|\n| --- | --- |\n|maxPoolShare|30%|\n|oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent|1.00%|\n\nBy adding this leveraged vault strategy to Notional, the protocol will effectively accept Balancer wstETH/WETH pool tokens as collateral. We propose setting the maximum vault capacity at 100 ETH to cap the maximum amount of ETH that can be borrowed from Notional to enter that specific strategy. Additionally, we propose setting the maximum pool share at 30% such that users won’t be able to enter the vault if the protocol already holds more than 30% of the balancer pool tokens.\n\nWe propose setting the maximum leverage at 11X such that if a user deposits 2 ETH, he can at a maximum borrow 20 ETH from Notional to LP in the Balancer token pool. This maximum leverage ratio (minimum collateral ratio) aims to protect the protocol against a large decrease in wstETH/WETH pool token value. Setting the strategy's maximum leverage ratio at 11X ensures the protocol would be protected against a decrease of -7.3% in pool token value (wstETH/WETH BPTs) relative to the vault’s borrow currency (ETH). Historically the wstETH/WETH market exchange rate has varied by a maximum of 2.4% over a 24H period and 0.7% over a 24H period after the merge. It’s important to note that the vault’s maximum leverage ratio is set as a precautionary buffer to protect the protocol and that it is unlikely that the value of pool tokens will decline by such a magnitude relative to users’ debts.\n\nWe propose setting the MaxDeleverageCollateralRatio at 0.17, this implies that a liquidator can lower an account’s leverage ratio to 6.9X if it ever breaches the max leverage ratio of 11X. This ratio is set such that an account that gets liquidated will subsequently be able to withstand another large decrease in the strategy token price before becoming eligible for liquidation again thereby lowering the risk of an account being liquidated multiple times over a short time period.\n\nWe propose setting the minimum borrow size at 2 ETH and the vault liquidation discount at 2%. These parameters aim to maximize the likelihood of successful liquidations under stressed market conditions. To do so, a liquidator’s revenues from the liquidation discount must be sufficient to cover liquidation expenses (gas cost, slippage, Dex fee, price basis). By setting the minimum borrow size at 2 ETH and the liquidation discount at 2%, liquidators will likely receive at a minimum 0.04 ETH. Based on historical market conditions such a liquidation discount will likely cover a liquidator’s expenses under most scenarios.\n\nWe propose setting the leveraged vault fee at 0.50% such that borrowers will pay a 0.50% premium on their borrow rate when entering the vault. We propose setting the reserve fee share at 80% such that 80% of the borrow premiums will go to Notional reserves.\n\nWe propose setting the oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent to 1.00%. The oraclePriceDeviationLimitPercent prevents users from entering or exiting the vault if the implied pool price deviates from the oracle price by more than 1%. This parameter mitigates oracle attack vectors while being flexible enough to ensure users can enter and exit the vault even if oracle prices slightly deviate from on-chain prices in between updates.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

Additionally we propose increasing the Prime rETH supply cap from 300 Prime rETH to 1,000 Prime rETH.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe propose updating rETH’s oracle address from the Chainlink [rETH/ETH exchange rate oracle](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF3272CAfe65b190e76caAF483db13424a3e23dD2) to the Chainlink [rETH/ETH market price oracle](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xD6aB2298946840262FcC278fF31516D39fF611eF). Note that this update will also be applied to the rETH/WETH Aura leveraged vault. We think that using the rETH/ETH market price is more appropriate than looking at the rETH/ETH contract exchange rate in a liquidation context as the market price of rETH could be lower or higher than the rETH/ETH exchange rate. By updating the rETH oracle to look at its actual market price vs a static exchange rate the Notional protocol will be able to better respond to potential changes in the rETH/ETH market price. Updating the oracle price for the rETH’s market price will also increase the likelihood of successful liquidations by making the oracle prices more likely to be in line with on-chain prices.\n\nWe also propose increasing the Prime rETH supply cap from 300 Prime rETH to 1,000 Prime rETH. This will allow more rETH depositors to supply rETH to the protocol. The Prime rETH supply cap was initially set lower than for other liquid staking derivatives because the rETH oracle was not capturing the asset’s market price. The current Prime rETH supply is currently 223.6 Prime rETH and is at 75% utilization. Increasing the supply cap will make the protocol more usable to end users.\n\n|Parameter|Current value|Proposed value|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|rETH oracle address|[0xF3272CAfe65b190e76caAF483db13424a3e23dD2](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xF3272CAfe65b190e76caAF483db13424a3e23dD2#readContract#F4)|[0xD6aB2298946840262FcC278fF31516D39fF611eF](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xD6aB2298946840262FcC278fF31516D39fF611eF#readContract#F4)|\n|Prime rETH supply cap|300 Prime rETH|1,000 Prime rETH|\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

This will allow more users to enter the FRAX/USDC.e vault as the current vault utilization has reached 90%.\n\n# Proposal\n\nThe current FRAX/USDC.e Convex vault maxBorrowCapacity parameter is currently set to 20,000 FRAX such that the maximum amount of FRAX that can be borrowed from Notional to LP in the Convex pool is 20,000. This parameter was set when launching Notional V3 on Arbitrum and was set arbitrarily low given V3 had just launched. The current vault utilization is currently 90% (18,000 out of 20,000 FRAX). Increasing the maximum borrow capacity will allow non-U.S. users to borrow FRAX at a fixed or variable rate from Notional and LP the proceeds to the Convex FRAX/USDC.e pool to benefit from the pool’s yield.\n\nThe [FRAX/USDC.e Curve pool](https://curve.fi/#/arbitrum/pools/factory-v2-41/deposit) currently holds $2.4M in TVL with 50% ($1.2M) of the pool being boosted through Convex. On-chain liquidity for FRAX and USDC.e on GMX, Uniswap V3, and Curve is relatively deep allowing to easily swap USDC.e for FRAX with minimal slippage. Given the pool’s size, we propose setting the maximum borrowing capacity to 250,000 FRAX or about 20% of the Convex pool size.\n\n# Resources\n\n* [Notional V3 docs](https://docs.notional.finance/notional-v3/)\n* [V3 Risk docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-risk-parameters/)\n* [V3 Technical docs](https://docs.notional.finance/v3-technical-docs/deployed-contracts/notional-v3)\n* [V3 Dune dashboard ](https://dune.com/PierreYves_Gendron/notional-dashboard)",

      "title": "[NIP-31] - Modify Notional V3's External Lending Logic",
      "content": "# Summary\nWe propose to modify Notional’s external lending logic to direct interest earned on unutilized supply funds to the protocol itself instead of variable rate lenders on Notional.\n\nThis will make Notional significantly more profitable without impacting the attractiveness of lending on the protocol due to the protocol’s ability to generate yield for lenders via borrowing.\n\n# Motivation\nWe believe this is the best course of action for the following reasons:\n\nIt makes Notional significantly more profitable. Increased gross revenues and margins will help Notional grow and generate value. As of now, the changes we suggest would increase Notional V3’s current revenue rate by 84%.\n\nIt improves UX for users. Returning yield to lenders makes variable rate lending and borrowing on Notional very complicated and it becomes difficult to judge what variable rates could or will be in the future. This change makes variable rate lending and borrowing on Notional simple.\n\nIt is easy to implement. The code changes required are minor and don’t touch the core protocol.\n\n# Implementation\nThe code necessary to implement this change has already been written. Upon approval of this proposal, the code will be tested, audited, and deployed. Once the code has been deployed, Notional would phase in the change over time starting with one or two currencies and eventually expanding to all eligible currencies.\n\nWe would expect the time from approval of the proposal to full implementation would be roughly 6-8 weeks.",

      "content": "# Summary\nWe propose to focus on Arbitrum for Notional V3’s first L2 deployment.\n\n# Background\nDeploying on L2 is critically important for the success and growth of Notional. Gas costs on Ethereum mainnet price out the vast majority of users, and a presence on L2 is required to reach a broad user base.\n\nWith Notional V3 launching soon, we must decide where to focus our initial effort. We plan to launch a deployment of Notional V3 on many L2s, but each one takes time, effort, and resources if we want it to succeed. This means that we need to focus on a single L2, so choosing the best one for Notional is important.\n\n# Why Arbitrum?\nHere are the main reasons why we believe Aribtrum is the best L2 to start with:\n\nArbitrum is Ethereum’s leading L2. It has the most user activity and TVL (~$2.4B vs. ~$1B for Polygon and Optimism).\n\nNotional will be able to deploy the same leveraged vault strategies on Arbitrum that it does on Mainnet because Balancer and Convex are deployed there, and Aura will deploy there as well.\n\nNotional is already testing its V3 UI against an Arbitrum deployment, so focusing on Arbitrum instead of Polygon or Optimism will involve less marginal work.\n\nMajor potential integrators like Contango 1 have chosen Arbitrum which would increase the immediate size of Notional’s L2 ecosystem and reach.",

      "content": "# Summary\nWe propose to start incentivizing veBAL holders to vote for the sNOTE gauge in order to increase the sNOTE incentive yield on Balancer. Moreover, we propose to use the DAO’s AURA and BAL tokens that will be received as grants from the Aura and Balancer grant programs to increase the sNOTE pool incentive allocation by converting them to veBAL and vlAURA, respectively.\n\nFinally, we propose to reduce weekly COMP reinvestments from 200 COMP to 65 COMP and augment with 10,000 NOTE per week.\n\n# Context\nThe Notional DAO treasury currently controls the following assets:\n\n|Asset | Usd value |\n|----|----|\n|COMP|\t$173,500|\n|BAL|\t$93,750 (expected)|\n|AURA|\t$18,750 (expected)|\n|NOTE|\t$6,300,000|\n|cETH|\t$28,000|\n|cDAI|\t$95,000|\n|cUSDC|\t$99,000|\n|cWBTC|\t$24,000|\n|Total|\t$ 6,832,000|\n\nThe DAO will receive BAL tokens from the Balancer grants program as well as AURA tokens from the Aura grants program as compensation for leveraged vault audit related expenses.\n\nThe DAO could benefit from participating in the Aura and Balancer ecosystems to boost the incentive yield it receives on the sNOTE pool.\n\n# Proposal\nWe propose to use the BAL and AURA tokens to create an additional revenue stream for the DAO and further participate in the Balancer and Aura ecosystem.\n\n1) **Vote escrow BAL holdings to veBAL**\nWe propose to lock the DAO’s BAL tokens to veBAL for 1 year and periodically relock the veBAL in order to maximize its utility. We propose to use the DAO’s veBAL to vote on the sNOTE gauge in order to allocate more incentives to the sNOTE pool. The additional BAL incentives received as a consequence of these gauge votes would then be periodically harvested in order to increase the DAO’s veBAL balance. Under current market conditions, this strategy would yield about 29% in BAL incentives annually to the DAO or about $28K.\n\n2) **Vote Lock Aura holdings to vlAURA**\nWe propose to vote lock the DAO’s AURA tokens to vlAURA and then use our voting power to vote for Notional’s sNOTE gauge. This would increase the amount of BAL incentives allocated to the sNOTE pool. These additional incentives could then be used to increase the amount of veBAL controlled by the DAO. Under current market conditions, this strategy would yield about 30% in BAL incentives annually to the DAO or about $5.6K\n\n3) **Experiment with gauge vote incentivization on Hidden Hand**\nWe propose to experiment with incentivizing veBAL holders to vote toward the sNOTE gauge through Hidden Hand. This experiment should result in a greater allocation of BAL incentives towards the sNOTE pool. We propose to incentivize either veBAL holders directly or vlAURA holders depending on what would yield the best return per incentive dollar invested. The treasury manager would reinvest additional incentives received as a result of this experiment to incentivize veBAL holders on Hidden Hand during the next vote. If the strategy proves profitable, we would increase bribes until the sNOTE gauge receives 2% of all votes. After that, excess profits could either be converted to veBAL, used to conduct sNOTE reinvestments, or held as USDC by the treasury manager. While we don’t want the DAO to commit to executing this strategy over a specific timeline, we think it is worth experimenting with Hidden Hand as a potential way to increase the DAO’s revenue. We propose to start incentivizing on Hidden Hand with $2K in DAI for the first week of this experiment and reassess based on realized profitability over time.\n\n4) **COMP reinvestments**\nAs background, after a recent bug fix, Notional pulled its funds off of Compound V2 and is no longer earning COMP. This means that the DAO’s strategy of reinvesting COMP is no longer sustainable. We propose to reduce weekly COMP reinvestments from 200 COMP to 65 COMP and augment with 10,000 NOTE per week. This would reduce the sNOTE yield from ~$8,000 per week to $4,600 per week but would extend the runway for this reinvestment program from ~6 months to ~18 months.\n\n# Execution\nAll of the strategies mentioned above would be executed by the treasury manager at the direction of the DAO.\n\n# Conclusion\nThe objective of these different initiatives is to increase the incentive yield of the sNOTE pool as an additional revenue stream for sNOTE holders and for the DAO. These initiatives would also reinforce the DAO’s commitment to the Balancer and Aura ecosystems.",

      "content": "# Summary\nWe propose to lower the annual NOTE incentives by 3,000,000 from 13,000,000 NOTE to 10,000,000 NOTE on the next quarterly roll occurring June 21st 2023 according to the following schedule:\n\n| Currency\t| Current incentives\t | Proposed incentives\t| Change (%)|\n|---------------|---|---|---|\n|ETH  |\t2,000,000 NOTE|\t2,000,000 NOTE\t|0.0%|\n|DAI |\t4,250,000 NOTE\t|2,500,000 NOTE\t|-41.0%|\n|USDC |\t6,750,000 NOTE\t|5,500,000 NOTE\t|-18.5%|\n|WBTC |\t0 NOTE|\t0 NOTE|\t0.0%|\n|Total |\t13,000,000 NOTE\t|10,000,000 NOTE|\t-23.0%|\n\n# Context and objective\nAs we approach the launch of Notional v3, we want to continue making progress toward reducing the total amount of incentives given to LPs. As outlined in our incentive rebalancing framework, it is one of our objectives to lower incentive emission rates over time. These updates represent an important step toward more sustainable nToken returns while ensuring the protocol still attracts an adequate amount of liquidity for lenders and borrowers.\n\nWith the launch of Notional v3, we anticipate higher organic nToken returns due to:\n\n* Higher variable rate returns on nToken accounts net prime Cash holdings\n* Higher trading fees due to leveraged fCash trading\n* Higher fees from leveraged vaults\n\nMoreover, the redesign of Notional’s AMM curves in v3 will increase the capital efficiency of liquidity pools by (1X to 3X). Higher capital efficiency means that fCash slippage will be lower for traders in Notional v3, assuming liquidity is constant.\n\nThis makes us confident that we can proceed with an incentive reduction, as the incentive yield reduction will be compensated by higher organic returns over time.\n\n# Proposal\n### ETH\nWe propose to leave ETH incentives untouched as ETH liquidity will be primordial for ETH based leveraged vaults. Moreover, with the launch of v3 we plan to list multiple LSD markets (ex: wstETH, rETH, cbETH) enabling users to open leveraged long or leveraged short positions between ETH and LSDs. Therefore we want to continue heavily incentivizing ETH LPs over the coming months.\n\n### DAI\nWe propose to lower the nDAI incentive rate from 4,250,000 to 2,500,000 NOTE (-41%) per year. As mentioned in the previous NOTE incentive update, we have historically seen that DAI trading volumes have been lower than USDC trading volumes. Moreover, DAI liquidity has been less sticky and more reflexive during market downturns than USDC liquidity. This is because DAI holders need to repay their CDPs as markets go down. Therefore we think it is a better path forward to allocate more incentives towards nUSDC over nDAI for now. Once v3 is deployed and has been live for multiple months, we think it will be worthwhile to consider applying for a Maker D3M that would allocate DAI liquidity directly to pDAI (Notional’s variable rate DAI market). In the meantime, we think the DAO should continue to incentivize nDAI but at a slower pace.\n\n### USDC\nWe propose a slight reduction in nUSDC incentives from 6,750,000 to 5,500,000. The nUSDC NOTE incentive yield has averaged 11.5% over the past 30 days. We feel a 20% reduction would still present an attractive return (9.2%) for USDC LPs.",

This transfer is necessary to ensure that the Notional proxy contract holds a sufficient amount of NOTE tokens to pay incentives to Notional LPs for the foreseeable future. This proposal has no direct impact on NOTE token holders and is purely operational.\n\nThe Notional proxy contract currently holds 4.5M NOTE tokens. Given the proposed transfer, the proxy contract would hold 19.5M NOTE. \n\nThe current nToken incentive rate is 13M NOTE per year. Thus the proxy contract would hold a sufficient amount of NOTE incentives for at least 1.5 years at the current pace. Let's note that we also plan to continue to decrease the amount of NOTE incentives given to nToken holders over time as nToken organic yields increase. Therefore the proxy contract will hold enough incentives for more than 1.5 years of operation.",

The treasury manager will use the COMP accrued to this date to conduct NOTE re-investments over the first six months of the program.\n\n2. The treasury manager will use 100% of the COMP that Notional will accrue going forward on a regular basis to conduct NOTE re-investments as it is accrued. These re-investments will continue until the community votes to amend this plan in the future.\n\n3. Transaction fees generated by the protocol will stay in the protocol’s reserves in the form of cTokens.\n\n4. The 30k/week NOTE incentives currently flowing toward the 50/50 NOTE/WETH pool would be redirected to the 80/20 NOTE/WETH pool upon deployment of the NOTE staking module. Incentives would continue at this rate for a minimum of 6 weeks. After this point, these incentives would be re-evaluated and potentially updated.\n\nLinked NRC: https://forum.notional.finance/discussion/3688-staked-note-reinvestment-plan",
