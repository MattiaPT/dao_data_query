      "content": "## High Level:\nAxelar wants to add axlUSDC<>USDC to Liquidity Book on Avalanche. This pool will provide liquidity for cross-chain applications built on top of Axelar’s decentralized cross-chain infrastructure. We intend for this to be the canonical liquidity venue for axlUSDC as we grow our exposure in the Avalanche ecosystem. Axelar will seed 500k of initial liquidity for the axlUSDC<>USDC pools on TraderJoe and would like to grow the volume and TVL of these pools. We envisage this to be an attractive offering given the fact that axlUSDC pools are already earning at the time of writing between 10-20% APR on Curve. axlUSDC pools on Avalanche, BNB, and Polygon are consistently one of the pools with the highest volumes in the last 6 months.\n\n## Asset Confirmation:\nIs this Asset on Avalanche or Arbitrum: Avalanche\nConfirm Token name, tag and contract id: axlUSDC, 0xfaB550568C688d5D8A52C7d794cb93Edc26eC0eC\nLink to Coingecko or CMC page: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/axelar-usdc\nLink to Token Contract on relevant Explorer: https://snowtrace.io/token/0xfaB550568C688d5D8A52C7d794cb93Edc26eC0eC\n\n## Tokenomics:\nDetail Tokenomics of the suggested base asset: N/A, axlUSDC is 1:1 with USDC\n\nDetail emissions schedule (where feasible): N/A, no emissions of axlUSDC.\n\n## Summary:\nAxelar delivers secure cross-chain communication for Web3. Our infrastructure enables dApp users to interact with any asset or application, on any chain, with one click.\n\naxlUSDC is Axelar’s bridged version of Ethereum USDC; for every axlUSDC there is one USDC locked on Ethereum. axlUSDC functions as Axelar’s routing asset across the 40+ chains supported by the Axelar Network. This axlUSDC<>USDC pool will power hundreds of cross-chain applications built on top of Axelar’s decentralized cross-chain infrastructure, including native-to-native cross-chain swaps.",

Supporting GoGoPool with Liquidity Book will help to support the acceleration and growth of Avalanche via proliferation of Subnets. \n\n## About GoGoPool\nGoGoPool is a permissionless staking protocol designed for Avalanche Subnets, simplifying validator node sourcing and reducing validation costs through liquid staking. GoGoPool reduces the AVAX requirement of launching a new validator node by ~50% via liquid staking. \n\nLiquid staking users swap AVAX for ggAVAX, a token which represents their staked AVAX plus any rewards it has accrued. ggAVAX holders can redeem at any time for AVAX so long as there's float in the contract.\n\nOn the other side of the protocol, node operators supply their own hardware and register minipools by staking 1000 AVAX and 10% value in our GGP token as collateral. Minipools are matched with funds from liquid stakers and launched as full validators. \n\n## Specifications\nChain: Avalanche\nToken:  $ggAVAX\nContract: https://snowtrace.io/address/0xA25EaF2906FA1a3a13EdAc9B9657108Af7B703e3\n\n## Tokenomics\nggAVAX is an ERC4626. Staking rewards are reflected in the exchange rate between ggAVAX and AVAX, which will favor ggAVAX over time.\n\n## Summary\nGoGoPool’s mission is to accelerate the Subnet Economy. We believe ggAVAX will be an important base primitive in Avalanche that will align the community’s incentives towards a common goal: to help builders bring blockchain to the world using Subnets. Utilizing Liquidity Book for liquidity provisioning will help to drive towards that goal.\n\n## Links\nLitepaper: https://docs.gogopool.com/gogopool-litepaper \nGithub: https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogopool\nZellic & Code4rena audits: https://docs.gogopool.com/audits",

Due to a significant amount of the supply being staked or locked to pariticpate in these IDOs it has meant that there is a lack of liquidity for the pair ($400k). This has resulted in a 10 AVAX buy leading to a 0.1% price impact and a 100 AVAX buy having a 1% price impact. Currently more than $10m of the $14m MC is locked in the platforms staking or locking mechanisms.\n\nThese types of buys are trivial in the grand scheme of the markets and making XAVA a quote asset will aid in reducing price impact and slippage of buys. Ensuring that liquidity is more efficient for this longstanding Avalanche protocol that supports builders.\n\n## Solution:\n\nAllow for XAVA to be a quote asset and launch the XAVA-AVAX market to ensure that the liquidity that is present can be used more efficiently. \n\n## Info:\nhttps://avalaunch.app/\nToken Address: 0xd1c3f94DE7e5B45fa4eDBBA472491a9f4B166FC4 \n",

This architecture includes features such as: overcollateralization, forced-redemption capacity, variable interest rate defense, and interest-bearing for stakers.\n• MONEY is the first interest-bearing stablecoin on the Avalanche blockchain. \n\n## Ideal Market\n• Stablecoins are an integral feature of DeFi, and MONEY is one of the leading overcollateralized stablecoins on Avalanche. \n\n## Specifications:\nMarket: Avalanche\nToken Name: MONEY\nAssociated Protocol: Moremoney Finance\nProtocol Website: https://moremoney.finance/\nCoingekko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/moremoney-usd\nToken Contract: https://snowtrace.io/address/0x0f577433Bf59560Ef2a79c124E9Ff99fCa258948\nTokenomics: https://moremoney.gitbook.io/docs/how%20cdp%20earnings%20are%20used/money \n",

      "content": "*Proposal by Nadim of Ava Labs recording a temperature check vote of 25 in favour and 1 against*\n\n## High Level:\nAave V3 is one of the core DeFi protocols on Avalanche and has been deeply integrated across the ecosystem. Its token, AAVE, is one of the top DeFi tokens with over $1.2B in market capitalization and daily volumes ranging between $50M to $200M across all exchanges. There is over $400K in liquidity currently in the V2 AAVE - AVAX pool. \n\n## Specifications:\nListing on the Avalanche LB Market\nToken name: AAVE.e\nContract ID: 0x63a72806098bd3d9520cc43356dd78afe5d386d9 (https://snowtrace.io/token/0x63a72806098bd3d9520cc43356dd78afe5d386d9)\nCoingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aave\nCoinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/\n\n## Tokenomics:\nAAVE is primarily used as a governance token for the Aave protocol (tokenomics doc). Governance proposals require holding AAVE tokens and votes are weighted based on how many tokens a wallet holds.\nUsers can stake their tokens into the Safety Module (SM) to provide funds that can be used to secure the protocol in exchange for a reward paid in Aave tokens and issued by the ecosystem reserve (the % of the bonus is periodically decided by governance, and these token emissions are classified as safety incentives or SI).\nThe total supply of AAVE is 16M, of which 13M were redeemable by holders of the previous token, LEND, and the remaining 3M was allocated to the Aave Reserve and controlled by the AAVE token holders, to incentivize the Aave Ecosystem growth and development.\n\n## Summary:\nAAVE is a widely adopted DeFi token that plays a core part in the governance and safekeeping of the Aave protocol. It is already listed on Trader Joe V1 (paired with AVAX) and would benefit from the efficiency of a V2 listing which could boost trading volume and allow for more capital efficiency with the same level of liquidity. This listing would also help consolidate Liquidity Book as a primary venue for trading Avalanche ecosystem tokens.",

Pseudo - Delta-Neutral - Buying GLP with USDC/WAVAX/W.BTC and                        allocating and adjustting them to GLP's composition for the                                       vaults (% spread)\n    b.

The lending protocol allows users to lend, borrow, or earn interest using their digital assets. The Liquid Staking protocol provides a solution for capital efficiency, offering users the opportunity to unlock their “staked” AVAX to be used on Decentralized Financial protocols\n\nQI is token native to Avalanche which has a lot of holders since it is given as rewards for lending on BENQI's lending protocol and it has decent volume (around 500k USD / week).\n\nCurrent liquidity on Pangolin is $2.4M\n\nCurrently the biggest pool for QI is the QI-AVAX on Pangolin, with BENQI having Protocol Owned Liquidity there. It is my belief that having a LB market for QI would incentivize QI holders, and why not BENQI's POL, to migrate to LB for it's better efficiency and the fees it generates.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nChain : Avalanche\nToken information : BENQI, QI, 0x8729438EB15e2C8B576fCc6AeCdA6A148776C0F5\nCoingecko : https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/benqi\nSnowtrace : https://snowtrace.io/token/0x8729438EB15e2C8B576fCc6AeCdA6A148776C0F5\n\n\n## Tokenomics\nSupply cap : 7,200,000,000 QI\nCirculating supply : 3,255,164,412 QI (as of the 10th of January)\n    20 572 holders 45% of the total supply is allocated for liquidity mining and community incentives\n\n\n## Summary\n\nQI is an Avalanche native token which has a lot of holders and good volume with most of its liquidity on Pangolin DEX.

Right now there are nearly ~2M LINK is floating around the Avalanche ecosystem but still struggle quiet often those of us hold/trade LINK and generate any yield on LINK. Adding Link.e would make for a good V2 pair to AVAX which should drive volume coming from all the LINK holder in Avalanche ecosystem will be able to join V2 especially to take advantage on zero slippage trade from V2 and frequent rebalancing to its true price when users enter and exit. \nMoreover as a DEX it should be high priority to allow such high quality projects volume to grow as it onboard LINK holder to Traderjoe DEX and Avalanche ecosystem as well.\n\n\n## Specifications:\nThis proposal is for the Avalanche listing.\n\n\n$LINK.e https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/chainlink\n\nLink to Token Contract: https://snowtrace.io/token/0x5947bb275c521040051d82396192181b413227a3\n\nTokenomics: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/chainlink/tokenomics\n\nOffical Website: https://chain.link/\n\n\n## Summary:\nProposal is to add LINK.e as a base asset and open the LINK.e-AVAX V2 pool.",

      "content": "*Proposed in discord by og_yoloswag69, temperature check: 46 votes in favor, 1 against.*\n\n## Summary:\nThis proposal would add VTX as a base asset and open a Liquidity Book pool.\n\n## High Level:\n**Protocol Overview**\n * Vector started as the \"Convex of Avalanche\" by permanently staking PTP and JOE to accumulate respective \"-ve\" tokens and in turn offer boosted yields to liquidity providers.\n * The Protocol has accumulated more than 1.1 billion veJOE and 835 million vePTP\n\n**Intangibles**\n* Vector is integral to liquidity provisioning on Platypus\n* Inextricably linked to the success of Avalanche DeFi\n* The Protocol and VTX token holders have a vested interest in the long-term success in Trader Joe and will be an important voice as governance evolves.\n\n**Token Overview**\n* VTX is Vector's governance token. When locked as LVTX, it earns both protocol revenues and bribe income. Currently, the token earns 24.4 percent of real yield from performance fees and bribe income.\n* Under the 1 JOE = 1 vote model, VTX controls voting power for over 14.1  million JOE tokens. Therefore, 10,000 locked VTX has voting power equivalent to 5,000 JOE, 400,000 veJOE, and 300,000 vePTP\n\n\n## Considerations\n**Market**\n* 26.7 million of the total 35.8 million VTX (approximately 75 percent) are locked\n* Of the remaining tokens in circulation, over 3.3 million are in the VTX-AVAX pool\n* 24h utilization generally does not exceed 10 percent. Very capital inefficient.\n* Volatility does not necessarily move in sync with markets as there is a four-week cool-off period before LVTX is fully unlocked and tradable.\n\n**Shortcomings alleviated by a VTX-AVAX V2 pair**\n* Deep liquidity despite low volumes and circulation\n* High slippage despite low volatility\n* Volatility that does not correspond with market conditions\n\n\n## Specifications:\nAsset Confirmation:\n**Market**: Avalanche\n**Token Name**: VTX\n**Associated Protocol**: Vector Finance\n**Token Contract ID**: 0x5817D4F0b62A59b17f75207DA1848C2cE75e7AF4\n**Joe LP Token Contract ID**: 0x9ef0c12b787f90f59cbbe0b611b82d30cab92929\nLinks\n**Snowtrace (VTX Token)**: https://snowtrace.io/token/0x5817D4F0b62A59b17f75207DA1848C2cE75e7AF4 \n**Snowtrace (VTX-AVAX JLP)**: https://snowtrace.io/token/0x9ef0c12b787f90f59cbbe0b611b82d30cab92929\n**Coinmarketcap**: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/vector-finance/\nJ**oe LP Token Analytics**: https://analytics.traderjoexyz.com/pairs/0x9ef0c12b787f90f59cbbe0b611b82d30cab92929\n**Protocol Website**: https://vectorfinance.io/\n**Token Distribution**: https://docs.vectorfinance.io/getting-started/tokenomics/token-distribution\n**Emissions Schedule**: https://docs.vectorfinance.io/getting-started/tokenomics/token-distribution/liquidity-mining-schedule ",

      "content": "*Proposed in discord by Ravageur, temperature check unanimous 30 votes in favor.*\n\n### Overview: \n\nyyAVAX is Yield Yak's yield-bearing liquid staking AVAX derivative token.  yyAVAX constantly accrues value vs AVAX via rewards for validating the Avalanche P-Chain, plus any yield generated through validator-specific opportunities. Yield Yak's liquid staking solution is audited and battle-tested over the past 7 months since its launch in May.  yyAVAX has been generating an average APR of ~8% since launch.  Its APR varies depending on the yield-generating opportunities specific to its network of validators. \n\n This is a proposal to add yyAVAX as a new base asset paired with AVAX. \n\nyyAVAX would make for a good V2 pair given its quasi-peg to AVAX which should drive volume from frequent rebalancing to its true price when users enter and exit. \n\nyyAVAX's approach to offering instant exits (there is no 15-day unlocking period) means as its adoption increases the benefit LB V2 markets can provide for low-slippage entry/exits would be very valuable. \n\n### Specifications: \n\nThis asset is on Avalanche only. \n\n$yyAVAX: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/yield-yak-avax\n\n**Token Contract**: https://snowtrace.io/address/0xf7d9281e8e363584973f946201b82ba72c965d27\n\n**P-Chain Contract**: https://explorer-xp.avax.network/address/avax1gfev5u7desmpc699x9yt683p09llf605e2z5nq\n\n**More info on yyAVAX**: \nhttps://yieldyak.com/liquid-staking\nhttps://yieldyak.medium.com/yyavax-to-launch-soon-with-capped-100k-yyavax-token-opening-ceremony-and-rewards-for-lps-d5844ac24e9a",
