Objections that are backed by a strong argument may potentially hold more weight than a simple objection vote.\n\n## Sophon Recommendation\nThe Sophons reached a consensus of \"no objection\", with all five recommending in favor of this proposal.\n\n## Results\nKIPs that receive > 50% ‘No Objection’ votes do not automatically pass. On completion of the vote, ‘Object’ votes will be analyzed and discussed by the Rook team and community. If a significant number of objections occur, the vote will either be marked as ‘Failed’ or enter a reconciliation phase.

Volunteers who self-identify and are elected from the community will become the multisig signers and sophons for the new DAO. The Incubator DAO will be independent, and its name, mission, strategy, rules and so on, will be decided entirely by ROOK tokenholders. At this point it is envisioned that the Incubator DAO will use the ROOK token for governance only.\n\n### Analysis and Rationale\n\nThe Rook DAO is designed around building software for large, risk-averse users and customers over a long period of time. Its conservative governance model is tailored for this specific mission, and generally prevents it from prioritising tokenholder-centric policies on treasury management or tokenomics in the current regulatory climate.\n\nIn the current Rook DAO, tokens are votes rather than shares, meaning that the treasury value is unrelated to the token value. Various initiatives like emissions, governance, staking, and utility, have all apparently failed to increase interest in the token over the last two years. Some tokenholders with new ideas for where to take the token are apparently discouraged when these ideas do not align with the specific mission or requirements of the current DAO, and are rejected.\n\nRather than continue to see tokenholder ideas rejected due to a lack of alignment, this proposal acknowledges the potential mismatch, and seeks to empower those tokenholders instead, by funding a separately-governed “Incubator DAO” with a large asset pool consisting of USDC resulting from swapping various ERC20 tokens (see Specification), plus 162,780 ROOK, and 10 ETH (for gas).\n\nWith these assets, the Incubator DAO will be better capitalised than well-known projects like 0x DAO ($4.1M at launch [1]), Index Coop (52.5% of tokens allocated to the community treasury [2], or $6.3M as of April 4, 2023 [3]), or a typical series A startup [4]. It will have a yet-to-be-defined mission or objective, unencumbered by the mission, expenses, and requirements of the current DAO. The Incubator DAO will be free to define its own mission, experiences, products, brand and marketing, and collectively manage liquidity, asset strategy, tokenomics, and governance in ways that totally align with tokenholder interests.\n\nWhen the Incubator DAO is funded, the current DAO will lose its link to the ROOK token, and its governance will change to a system driven by its multisig signers, who will use a simplified voting system that maintains effective controls over assets in the Treasury and Strategic Reserve. This change will allow the multisig signers to efficiently sort through the legal challenges related to the Strategic Reserve wallet before carrying the project forward.\n\nDAOs are flexible organisations that are uniquely suited to the ever-changing environment of DeFi. While they may not always be the fastest at making decisions, they are adaptive and highly durable. As participants in one of the oldest successful DAOs in the industry, we want to see tokenholders protected and empowered on their own terms.\n\n## Implementation\n\nTo receive funding, the Incubator DAO must inherit the governance of the current DAO as its initial framework. It must elect at least 4 multisig signers and 4 sophons. At least 2 sophons should not be multisig signers. No signer or sophon may be a contributor of the current DAO. Nominations for signers and sophons must be by open solicitation, and people must be allowed to self-nominate. There must be a public vote to elect signers and sophons from among the nominated candidates. A multisig wallet must be created to serve as the treasury for the Incubator DAO. Elected signers must be added to the multisig, and any non-elected signers must be removed.\n\nOn ratification of this proposal, numerous ERC20 tokens will be swapped for USDC (see Specification). Once the swaps are complete, and the above criteria are met, the USDC output of the swaps, plus 162,780 ROOK, plus 10 ETH (for gas) will be transferred to the Incubator DAO multisig.\n\nThe current DAO will at that point become governed by its multisig signers.\n\n## Execution\n\nSee the “Specification” section for execution details.\n\n## Monitoring and Reporting\n\nThe Treasury Team will prepare assets and monitor their transfer to the Incubator DAO. An update will be posted when asset transfer is completed.\n\n## Specification\n\nOn ratification of this proposal:\n\n1. Swap the following for USDC:\n\n      6,692,498.00 DAI\n\n      3,557,859.80 USDC\n\n      234,719.88 kDAI (LP token)\n\n      616,487.33 kUSDC (LP token)\n\n      2700.49 ETH\n\n      622.34 WETH\n\n      1,437.45 sETH2\n\n      1,212.23 rETH\n\n      37.70 rETH2\n\n      955.77 stETH\n\n      23.15 WBTC\n\n      3,038.98 ALCX\n\n      100.17 cvxFXS\n\n2. Verify that the Incubator DAO has created a multisig wallet and elected a set of at least 4 multisig signers and 4 sophons.\n\n3. Transfer the USDC from (1), 162,780 ROOK, and 10 ETH, from the current DAO treasury to the multisig wallet in (2).\n",

You can select any number of candidates.\n\nWhen voting ends, the candidates will be ranked by the number of votes they have received. The top 4 candidates by vote count are declared the winners.\n\nIf there is a tie, a runoff election will be held to determine the winners among those who are tied. This process continues until all ties have been broken.\n\n## Example\n\nSuppose we want to elect 4 candidates, and the vote totals after the first round are as follows:\n| Votes | Name |\n|--------|--------|\n| 20 | Alice |\n| 18 | Bob |\n| 5 | Charlie |\n| 4 | Doris |\n| 4 | Ed |\n| 1 | Felix |\n\nThen we select Alice, Bob, Charlie, Doris, and Ed as winners. But we only need to fill 4 seats, so we need Doris and Ed to participate in a runoff election to break the tie:\n\n| Votes | Name |\n|--------|--------|\n| 14 | Doris |\n| 8 | Ed |\n\nLooks like Doris was the winner, and the final slate is Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Doris.\n\n## Implementation\nThis is a test proposal to familiarise you with the process of Approval Voting.",

The funds requested in relation the current assets held by labs [1] are as follows:\n\n![first table](https://github.com/rookprotocol/kips/blob/master/KIP-43/kip43_table1.png)\n\nBased on the Treasury’s financial position [2], this net funding amount would equate to less than 3% of our stablecoin balance as of March 13, 2022.\n\n### Recap/Rationale\n\nIn September 2022, Rook Labs requested funding through KIP-34 [3] to support the ongoing operations and development of key Rook processes and infrastructure through December 31, 2022. More specifically, this proposal requested an allocation of 17 ROOK and 560,177 USDC to be transferred from the Treasury wallet to the Labs wallet.\n\nRook Labs used this budget to make progress on multiple fronts during the budget period, all of which can be found in the Labs Q4 report [4]. Labs also showed strong financial discipline in their spending, using approximately 70% of the budgeted USDC through December 31, 2022.\n\nThe “budget-to-actual” tables below provide further detail of this discipline during Q4. “Actual” data presented below and pulled from the Lab’s Ledger [5] are for October 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022. The following schedules present the Labs’ utilization of funding vs. what was allocated by the DAO:\n\n![second table](https://github.com/rookprotocol/kips/blob/master/KIP-43/kip43_table2.png)\n\nAs seen above, all teams ended the quarter with a surplus except for the Engineering team. The deficit for this team can be attributed to the fact that Labs reimbursed various infrastructure expenses paid for personally by the CTO dating back to February 2022. These funds were not originally included in the Q4 budget calculations, but Labs had sufficient surplus funds from elsewhere in the budget to cover the expenses; no additional funds were needed from the DAO Treasury. This deficit was formally announced to the DAO on December 1, 2022 and documented in a Budget Memo [8].\n\nThe following schedules present the outflows by function from the Rook Labs’ dedicated multisig:\n\n![third table](https://github.com/rookprotocol/kips/blob/master/KIP-43/kip43_table3.png)\n\n### Term and Total Request\n\nFor the first and second quarters of 2023, Labs is budgeting total USDC needs of approximately $695k and 0 ROOK units, respectively; however, because of the disciplined spending in the prior quarter, there is a large surplus of  approximately $105k USDC already in the Labs wallet that is expected to offset this funding need by roughly 15 66%. The net funding amount of approximately $590k is expected to fund Labs through June 30, 2023 (“Budget Period”). The schedule below reconciles  budget funds to funds remaining from prior funding cycles: \n\n![fourth table](https://github.com/rookprotocol/kips/blob/master/KIP-43/kip43_table4.png)\n\nThe following schedules present the summary of Q1 and Q2 2023 budgeted costs by both Labs function and cost category:\n\n![fifth table](https://github.com/rookprotocol/kips/blob/master/KIP-43/kip43_table5.png)\n\n\n## Budget Detail: Individual Team Allocations\n\n### Engineering\n\nThe schedule below presents the summary of USDC needs through June 30, 2023 for the Product and Protocol Engineering teams.\n\n![sixth table](https://github.com/rookprotocol/kips/blob/master/KIP-43/kip43_table6.png)\n\n* Key Highlights:\n  * These teams are expected to continue with the current contractor engineer as well as two other new engineers to assist in our internal product development.\n  * Dues and Subscriptions is comprised of various ongoing subscriptions, of which AWS is expected to cost 60,000 USDC and Datadog is expected to cost $30,000.\n\n### Growth\n\nThe schedule below presents the summary of USDC needs through June 30, 2023 for the Growth team.\n\n![seventh table](https://github.com/rookprotocol/kips/blob/master/KIP-43/kip43_table7.png)\n\n* Key Highlights:\n  * The majority of budgeted funds (48,625 USDC) for this team are for costs assumed during Rook's presence at ETHDenver. These costs include conference registration fees, sponsorship fees, the cost of the booth, and selective contributor travel expenses.\n  * There are $10,000 USDC budgeted for our Growth Team to have a strong presence at the Consensus conference occuring in Q2.   \n  * There are 24,000 USDC in budgeted funds reserved for part time Growth/Community Specialists to support the DAO’s efforts.\n\n### Organization\n\nThe schedule below presents the summary of USDC needs through June 30, 2023 for the Organization team.\n\n![eighth table](https://github.com/rookprotocol/kips/blob/master/KIP-43/kip43_table8.png)\n\n* Key Highlights:\n  * There are $50,000 in costs budgeted to accommodate research, professional fees, and further coordination of compliance based considerations to proactively prepare for the tough regulatory environment faced by the industry. \n* All other funds being requested relate to ongoing dues and subscriptions.\n\n### Studio\n\nThe schedule below presents the summary of USDC needs June 30, 2023 for the Studio team.\n\n![ninth table](https://github.com/rookprotocol/kips/blob/master/KIP-43/kip43_table9.png)\n\n* Key Highlights:\n  * The majority of the budgeted expenses for this team relate to paying external parties for various marketing and branding initiatives including:\n    * Content syndications (partnerships)\n    * Speaking opportunity placements\n  * The Studio Team is requesting approximately 13,700 USDC to continue the Starbased community content service that has been utilized since Q2 of 2022.\n  * The remaining funds will primarily be used to fund various contractors to assist on copywriting, graphic design work, and video/content creation\n\n### Treasury\n\nThe schedule below presents the summary of USDC needs through June 30, 2023 for the Treasury team.\n\n![tenth table](https://github.com/rookprotocol/kips/blob/master/KIP-43/kip43_table10.png)\n\n* Key Highlights:\n  * The majority of the budgeted expenses for this team relate to support two existing contractors that have been assisting on recurring Treasury initiatives.\n  * Other Expenses include $15,000 USDC in requested funds to support the productization of the stablecoin swap strategy being developed under KIPs 30 and 36 [6, 7]\n\n### Leadership\n\nThe schedule below presents the summary of USDC needs through June 30, 2023 for Leadership.\n\n![eleventh table](https://github.com/rookprotocol/kips/blob/master/KIP-43/kip43_table11.png)\n\n* Key Highlights:\n  * Other expenses are comprised of a 300,000 USDC discretionary budget. While not strictly defined, these discretionary funds could be leveraged for items such as:\n    * Opportunities that require greater levels of confidentiality or speed\n    * Team deficits as a result of unforeseen circumstances\n    * Legal costs\n    * Additional incentives to encourage partnerships\n\nNote: the discretionary budget from the previous quarter was leveraged to pay for AWS bills that had been incurred personally by our CTO dating back to April 2022.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Multisig Implementation\n\nThis budget, if approved, will allow for the transfer of requested funds from the Rook DAO Treasury (0x9a67F1940164d0318612b497E8e6038f902a00a4) to the Rook Labs multisig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006). The current signers of the Rook DAO Labs multisig are:\n\n* [@WhatsTheDeetz](https://forum.rook.fi/u/whatsthedeetz)\n* [@Pai-Sho](https://forum.rook.fi/u/pai-sho)\n* @JZ\n* @Hazard\n* @Tommy\n\n### Excess ROOK and USDC Rollover\n\nThe budget above represents in all cases an upper bound. It isn’t required that Labs spend all of it, and we do not seek to. If excess ROOK or USDC exists at the end of the budget period, it will carry over into the subsequent budget period unless superceded by another KIP.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Transfer 589,725 USDC from the Rook DAO Treasury (0x9a67F1940164d0318612b497E8e6038f902a00a4) to the Rook Labs multi-sig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006).\n2. As appropriate, provide funding from the Rook Labs multi-sig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006) to meet the needs outlined above during the budget period.\n3. Ensure proper recordkeeping to provide for ongoing review of any transactions by the DAO on the public Labs Ledger [5].\n4. Continue to provide detailed quarterly reporting to the DAO on expenses and revenues.\n",

This KIP proposes to extend the same powers articulated in those proposals.\n\n### Term of delegation\n\nThis proposal will cover the six months ending June 30, 2023, unless superseded by another KIP prior to that date.\n\n### Budget\n\nThere is no anticipated budget to fund this proposal beyond that established in Rook’s quarterly budgeting process.\n\n### Mission Alignment and Rationale\n\nThe leadership team has driven a complete reorganization of the DAO’s contributorship, the delivery of major protocol and product developments and the building of a cohesive and high-performance organization during the course of 2022 [4,5,6,7]. This proposal is intended to empower them to complete the promised cycle of work first formalized in KIP-12 [1] and to guide the DAO through key upgrades to the protocol.\n\n### Expected benefits for Rook\n\nContinuity in leadership will be essential for Rook as a whole to realize the potential of the transformations undertaken in 2022, especially given the upcoming launch of key protocol developments. Keeping current leadership in place will enable Rook to reach the goals set out in Rook’s quarterly reports over the course of 2022 [4,5,6,7]. Keeping the same leadership team will also provide stability for existing and potential integration partners, allowing ROOK to strengthen the roots of existing relationships and maintain its standard of transparency for new partners\n\n### Potential risks and mitigation\n\nContinuing to delegate these powers to hazard and JZ could pose potential risks to the DAO given the concentration of authority.  The fundamental mitigation of this risk is in the temporary nature of this proposal. This KIP is intended to provide time-limited authority to lead the DAO and protocol development into the first two quarters of 2023. \n\nAs first proposed in KIP-26 [3], this KIP continues to require committing to consistent reporting of progress. Effective reporting will require some combination of written updates, periodic community meetings to discuss progress, and the continued development of dashboards where the community can monitor that progress. \n\n### Oversight and Recourse\n\nThe leadership will operate under the review of the Sophons as established in KIP-12 [1]. The community also retains several forms of recourse. In the event that the community comes to consensus that leadership’s actions no longer have their trust, they could take any of the following actions:\n\n- Convene an “all hands on deck” community call with the leadership team to address specific issues\n- Unwind the authorities granted in this proposal through a formal KIP\n\n### Delegated Team\n\nThe leadership team members to be delegated the powers in this proposal are:\n\n- [@hazard](https://forum.rook.fi/u/hazard), CEO\n- @JZ, CTO\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Extend KIP-26 until the end of Q2 2023, i.e. midnight UTC on 30 June, 2023\n2. Continue to provide periodic reporting to the community on progress and new developments\n",

[Rook Treasury holdings](https://dune.com/0x_stubbs/Rook-Ecosystem)\n2. [Stablecoin Research ](https://deathereum.substack.com/p/chasing-stability-a-stablecoin-deepdive)\n\n## Background\n\nThe DeFi landscape is abundant with both opportunity and risk. These opportunities and risks are ever evolving and can materialize extremely quickly as a result of market and regulatory forces. To ensure that Rook DAO can nimbly respond to these changes in the operating conditions we must ensure that our execution processes are properly structured. More specifically, this document proposes that Rook DAO enable the Delegated Team with the ability to swap between Like-Kind Assets at their discretion.\n\n## Nature of powers to be delegated\n\nThis proposal delegates power to the Delegated Team to swap between Like-Kind Assets within each of the following three categories in Rook DAO’s Treasury [1] at their discretion.\n\n* Like-Kind Stablecoins\n  * USDC\n  * DAI\n  * USDT\n  * FRAX\n* Ethereum and Like-Kind Ethereum Derivatives\n  * ETH\n  * WETH\n  * Liquid staking derivatives\n    * rETH\n    * sETH2\n    * STETH\n* Bitcoin and Like-Kind Bitcoin Derivatives\n  * BTC\n  * WBTC\n  * renBTC\n\n## Term of delegation\n\nThe powers as defined above will stay in effect until superseded or amended by a subsequent KIP.\n\n## Budget\n\nNo budget is required as part of this proposal\n\n## Mission Alignment and Rationale\n\nOur goal here at Rook is to be on the cutting edge of blockchain technology and DeFi thought leadership. To accomplish this goal, we must ensure that we have sufficient runway and resources to support ongoing operations and development. The ability to nimbly respond to market and regulatory forces will enable the Rook DAO Treasury [1] to better preserve and grow the value of assets held.\n\n## Expected benefits for Rook\n\nThe expected benefits derived from this proposal are as follows:\n\n* Enables Rook DAO to more quickly respond to market, regulatory, or other risks that may materially impact our positions. Examples would include:\n  * Protection against a depegging events\n  * Protection from a potential freezing of assets by centralized parties\n  * Protection against market contagion events\n* Enables Rook to take advantage of opportunities that may present significant yield or revenue generation opportunities\n\n## Potential risks and mitigation\n\nAs with all investments, the benefits earned through greater discretion come with risks that are both financial and non-financial in nature. These risks and related mitigations should be assessed by the DAO in conjunction with the benefits stated above and would include:\n\n|Risk|Related Mitigation|\n| --- | --- |\n|Smart Contract Risk|All swaps will be done exclusively through the Rook Protocol or other battle tested protocols such as Uniswap, Sushiswap, 1inch, and Matcha|\n|Stablecoin Risk|All 4 of the proposed stablecoin assets are relatively low-risk in terms of depegging. See stablecoin research [2]|\n|Loss of funds via fraud or mismanagement|Funds will continue to be held in the Treasury multisig controlled by trusted core contributors (“Delegated Team”).|\n\n## Delegated Team\n\nThe parties to be delegated the powers in this proposal represent Rook Treasury’s current multisig signers\n\n* 0x00fA720A0943Cc51145b78775d2A4B8B5d83EcCc\n* 0x1C7ab7607DdDa01F3652CD5F985eA2F5e91100d9\n* 0xf251d356acF277507b78b0df07D82b94Df4B70A6\n* 0xf94ea804f840AA9e914E4288b84f52B99E29E9b8\n\n Any adjustments to the list of multisig signers above will not be required to go through general governance, but will be disclosed within 7 days of the change made.\n\n## Oversight and Recourse\n\nAll actions taken using these discretionary powers will be reported back to the DAO within 7 days and will include the rationale for the actions taken.\n\n## Specification\n\nEmpower the Delegated Team to use discretionary to swap between Like-Kind Assets.\n\n\n",

Key among these was the idea to use this changeover to trial a revised election process that spans three stages [2]: \n\n1. **Nomination** of the candidate, including information about the candidate’s background and contributions to the DAO.\n2. **Evaluation** of the candidate by the community, including public sessions with the community and the candidate.\n3. **Voting** on Snapshot for 5 days.\n\n## **Rationale**\n\nThe Sophon to be offboarded and replaced in this proposal is @Doge, who was described in the initial proposal as a community member as well as a researcher and token strategist [1]. \n\nNathan’s nomination is based on the results of a poll of the Sophons last year about what makes for an effective Sophon [3]. In that poll, the two strongest requirements were detailed knowledge of the Rook Protocol as well as of the Rook DAO and community. As a prominent MEV searcher, Nathan has a high level of knowledge of the Rook Protocol and where it sits in the modern MEV landscape, and has even advised on the design of several aspects of the system in the past. As a longtime DAO member, Nathan has always championed Rook inside the industry, and has participated in DAO-led podcasts, interviews, and other events to help Rook’s message reach a wider audience.\n\n Nathan has provided the following information to the community in support of his nomination: \n\n- **ENS address**\n    - nathanw.eth\n- **Discord and forum handles**\n    - @Nathan_\n- **Twitter handle**\n    - @NathanWorsley\n- **Background and Web3 expertise, and how this will benefit Rook DAO.**\n    - Nathan runs an MEV firm as well as a crypto exchange, and also works as an advisor to several projects. His unique perspective as both a user of the protocol (as a searcher) and an expert within this market segment, will ensure that Rook is able to tackle new challenges using its governance.\n- **Knowledge of Rook and prior contributions to the DAO**\n    - Nathan was an early DAO community member and served as an advisor to Rook on MEV and protocol development. He sat for podcasts with the DAO and has also shipped code across a few early Rook products.\n- **Current ROOK/xROOK holdings**\n    - Nathan has received 1000 ROOK for prior advisory work.\n- **Potential conflicts of interest**\n    - None\n- **Intent to abide by the Sophon KIP evaluation criteria ([link](https://forum.rook.fi/t/sophon-decision-criteria-rfc/419))**\n    - Yes.\n\n## Specification\n\n- Once posted as a KIP Draft to the forum, set at least one date for community interaction with Nathan, ideally at a governance workshop\n- After reaching soft consensus per our usual governance process, set up a 5-day election on Snapshot\n",

The two transactions (each $500k) made to establish the position can be found here [3] and here [4], respectively. Recently in an mStable forum post [2], a core mStable contributor called the medium-to-long term viability of the project into question citing multiple potential sources for concern, including but not limited to:\n\n* Lack of project runway\n* Difficulty to raise capital due to token concerns\n* Inability to create self-sustainability with the available product revenue flows\n\nDue to these facts, the Treasury Team has subsequently decided to review our position as outlined in KIP-22 [1], and feel it would be prudent to withdraw our liquidity. This is a risk-management decision motivated by risks of potential negative impact to our financial standing; although not definite, we believe it best to err on the side of caution in situations of this kind.\n\n## Details\nAt the time of writing, the Rook DAO treasury holds $1,021,259.75 [5] in the mStable / imUSD vault, earning roughly 2% yield. This position was opened in the interest of fostering a partnership with the mStable team and for the past year the position has performed as expected. In the time that has passed between the opening of the position and the present day the needs of the Rook DAO treasury and the situational stability of mStable have changed considerably. With the DAO looking to refine and reassess our treasury positions going into the new year and the uncertainty of the imUSD product in the future, we are taking the initiative and initiating this proposal before our holdings are exposed to any serious impact.\n\nIf enacted, the underlying capital will be withdrawn into USDC and held in the treasury as the Treasury Team looks to develop new opportunities to make these assets productive.\n\nIn the interest of continued good relations, the Treasury Team has reached out to the mStable team regarding the situation with the goal of providing full transparency around our motives and actions.\n\n### Investment amount and type\n\nAs outlined in KIP-22 [1], the mStable position was initiated for the purpose of yield generation. Rook’s position with mStable is $1.021 million as of the time of writing.\n\n## Expected benefits for Rook\nThe expected benefits of this proposal are as follows:\n\n* Protection from locking or loss of Treasury funds due to events out of our direct control.\n* ~$1m of treasury capital to be made liquid and available for future initiatives/investments.\n* Ability to monitor mStable and the broader market for developments and opportunities while reducing risk to our core stablecoin holdings.\n\n## Monitoring and Reporting\nThe Treasury multisig will report to the DAO upon completion of the trade, which will end with the return of the full position, in USDC, to the Treasury portfolio.\n\n## Specification \n* Proceed with withdrawal of total deposits and related earnings ($1.021m) to 0x9a67f1940164d0318612b497e8e6038f902a00a4 (“Rook DAO Treasury”)\n* Swap of the withdrawn assets (imUSD) to USDC\n* Report back to the DAO upon completion of transactions\n",

Until Rook technology is processing a substantial volume of orderflow, we cannot call the project or its products a success in any way. The orderflow landscape is evolving rapidly, and the next 6-12 months will be crucial.\n\nFor a system like Rook, the technology must fit the exact needs and specifications of its integration partners. Today, it does not. For nearly everyone we talk to, our tokenomics presents a major barrier to integration. Potential partners are uncomfortable with ROOK as the bid token for a neutral auction, and they unanimously do not want to receive MEV rebates in ROOK, a sentiment shared by average users. They also do not like the distribution of the bid and the way it is split between so many different parties.\n\nThe key to our mission is orderflow, and so we must update our tokenomics to reflect the new information we have gathered from these potential partners, which is today limiting any impact we can have.\n\n## Proposal Detail\n\n### Bid wETH, not ROOK\n\nWe talk to users, searchers, researchers, and potential integration partners constantly, from the largest of the large firms down to individual user stories. They are all unanimous: they do not want us to bid ROOK, and they do not want to receive MEV rebates in ROOK.\n\nWe hear many variations of the same sets of concerns, ranging from worries about neutrality, not wanting to appear biased to customers, not wanting them or their users to handle a strange token, not wanting to hold ROOK in their inventory, and also not wanting to liquidate the ROOK, and so on. But using ROOK for bids or rebates is always a no-go for them, and the larger the amount of orderflow they handle, the more likely it is that the preferential use of ROOK in the system will absolutely kill the integration.\n\nWhat they want us to do is to bid wETH, and what they want to receive is wETH or ETH. When we ask potential integration partners whether they would feel more comfortable if the token were wETH or ETH, their eyes light up. They smile again. “Oh, that would be awesome!” they say. This happens every. single. time. If we want to succeed, moving to wETH or ETH is a required change, full stop.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, this is not a difficult change to make. The Coordinator is capable of handling any ERC20 as the bid token and redistributing the same as the MEV rebate. As part of this proposal, we have prepared upgrades to the relevant smart contracts that would not only allow the use of wETH for searchers to stake and bid with, but would allow users to claim either wETH or ETH, as desired. The work is already done and can be made live very rapidly.\n\n### Set the bid distribution to 90% user, 10% DAO\n\nThe other major concern they have is our complicated bid distribution, which carves some out for burning, some for the DAO treasury, some for stakers, and some for the user. There may also be some for the partner if they program part of the user distribution as a fee. The searcher is also taking some. This is all just far more complicated than it needs to be, and turns every conversation into a math exercise. We got this wrong — simplicity is best and always was.\n\nWe care about orderflow and helping users get better transactions. Today, this complex tokenomics is not helping anybody. We need to walk before we can run, and that means streamlining this tokenomics into something clean and easy to understand.\n\nThe proposal is for a simple 90/10 split between the user and the DAO Treasury. Why? The other categories, burn and user staking, have been completely ineffective and would continue to be.\n\n* Even under optimistic models, the total ROOK supply burned would be very minimal, especially if a “flywheel” was in full effect. As the value of a ROOK token increased, the effect of the burn would vanish.\n\n* The current APR for user staking is less than half of the deposit fee - there is no incentive to stake ROOK as a user and even after we begin to drive orderflow, this would not be certain to change. Market forces would compress the amount of ROOK returned to the user through staking. And the incentives do not work out. If the value of a ROOK token increased, the APR would decrease, leading stakers to unstake and liquidate. This would decrease the value of a ROOK token, leading APR to increase, leading others to buy and stake. Rinse and repeat. A volume-pegged MEV stablecoin.\n\nNeither of these mechanisms drive orderflow through the Coordinator in any way. Neither of them contribute to increasing volume, and in both the added complexity and reduction of user reward, they in fact stand in the way of adoption. They should be removed from the bid distribution.\n\n### Where does that leave us?\n\nIf we make these changes, it allows us to make a very stark and simple proposition to users and potential partners: “Rook is a neutral system that runs on ETH. Use Rook, and you will automatically earn ETH. The system will always return 90% of the MEV to you.” This is a powerful message that we already know excites every user and partner we speak to.\n\nThe ROOK token will remain a crucial part of the DAO’s infrastructure, and its tokenomics will continue to evolve. As the governance token of the Rook DAO, it will grant staked tokenholders the ability to vote on key matters and decisions of the DAO, and on all proposals, such as this one. This is a solid starting point from which we can explore some of the new ideas and directions we have in mind for the token and its role in the ecosystem. In the short-term, orderflow is the most important thing, bar none.\n\n## Specification\n\n* Following ratification, deploy an updated Coordinator smart contract allow wETH staking and bidding, rather than ROOK.\n* Update all relevant associated software and documentation to reflect the change.\n",

Like our DAO, this document should be viewed as a living organism that is flexible and must adapt to not only survive, but thrive. \n\nThis document is intended to provide a North Star, so to speak, by which governance can make more decisive, systematic, and collaborative decisions within a broad framework.\n\nThis charter explores and presents a shared culture around the DAO’s treasury and identifies the purpose of the Rook DAO Treasury as well as five core principles to effectively manage it.\n\nUpon adoption, this Treasury Charter will guide treasury activities for the ROOK Protocol.\n\n## Document Text\n\n### DAO Treasuries Are Checking Accounts: Not Brokerage Accounts\n\nGo into any discord of a DAO with funds in its treasury and you will see the same thing: dozens, and in some cases hundreds, of community members recommending that the DAO invest their money into a countless number of projects to receive a variety of different returns. While many of these ideas could result in meaningful windfalls, are they truly helping meet the long-term mission of the DAO? In many cases these basic investments simply expand the treasury’s balance and don’t consider the opportunity costs of not using those funds to instead acquire another cash-generating protocol, investing in talent to expand/diversify existing capabilities, or potentially support integration partners who support the flywheel we hope to create.\n\nThe purpose of any DAO is to manage and govern its protocol in perpetuity. DAOs therefore need to position themselves in a way that not only ensures their ongoing operations can continue, but also lets them invest in their protocol’s future growth. Instead of viewing our treasury as a brokerage account, these funds should be used as a checking/saving account to fund  the DAO’s mission and operations. Although the DAO structure is a new paradigm in social interaction, in the end, it is just a more transparent and equitable form of organization that should emphasize sustainability and proper risk management.\n\nImagine if early stage Amazon had chosen to deploy the extra cash in their treasury into a portfolio of securities to earn an immediate return. Would they have built the capabilities, talent, or moat that they have now? Would they have had the liquidity to survive during the dot com bubble crash? Instead, they took a simple stance: let’s reinvest our money in internal efforts that make us the easiest and most reliable retailer in the world. They focused on being customer obsessed and correlating their spending back to their long-term mission.\n\nWe propose a similar path for Rook. Simply put, let’s invest in ourselves and the things we can control. We should make bold rather than timid decisions where we see a sufficient probability of gaining market leadership advantages and should manage the treasury to support our ability to make those long-term investments. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and we will have learned another valuable lesson in either case.\n\n## Purpose of the DAO Treasury\n\nThe purpose of the Rook DAO treasury is to ensure that the operation of the DAO is ongoing, sustainable, and resilient to market volatility. As such, the main focus of the treasury management framework is to ensure that decisions are being made to support the contributors, capture market share and support key infrastructure of the DAO. While direct investments in other tokens will be key to the treasury’s mission of ensuring stability, the primary driver of treasury growth should be the revenues generated through partnerships, integrations and protocol revenues.\n\nLike our members, the goals, initiatives, and passions of our DAO are diverse and cannot be managed as fully independent variables. There are myriad investment opportunities available but they must be managed in relation to each other in the aggregate including consideration of protocol risks, opportunity costs, lockup periods, etc.\n\nAs such, we roughly strive to prioritize using treasury funds across four key areas, in order of priority:\n\n1. Funding ongoing operations through budgets discussed and ratified through governance\n2. Building and maintaining capital reserves as a buffer against market volatility\n3. Funding community grants in support of community-generated initiatives that support Rook’s overall mission\n4. Making targeted and risk-controlled strategic investments\n\nBy focusing on these key uses of funds rather than unrelated speculative investments, we can more effectively manage risk and rewards as well as better align our capital and mission.\n\n## Core Principles\n\nTo effectively ensure the survival of the Rook DAO treasury, the community controlling it should strive to operate by five key principles:\n\n* Mission-based management: All treasury decisions should be viewed in relation to their impact on the mission of the DAO\n* Maintain an infinite time horizon: The treasury should be structured to exist in perpetuity\n* Systematic Execution: Decisions should be made in a systematic, informed and understandable manner\n* Diversification is critical: Treasury allocations should ensure that critical expenses can be funded even if the protocol token has a significant drawdown.\n* Find Win-Win Scenarios: The most optimal ROI is one where others win with us.\n\n### Mission-Based Management\n\nA common attribute of organizations that have a high-performance culture is that they have a clear, well-specified purpose that states both how and why the organization makes a positive impact on the world. It’s their fundamental reason for existence beyond just making money. This is not a “feel-good” statement, it actually pulls people forward, especially in difficult (and good) times. It helps people make better decisions and generates tremendous energy that aligns everyone toward a common cause.\n\nThe reason it is so powerful is because it’s the why: the emotional connection the DAO has to the world. It’s an outside-in perspective, rather than the more common inside-out approach typically used by organizations. Humans are emotional beings that buy-in to communities based on how much the purpose resonates with their own values.\n\nLuckily, Rook DAO’s why (its mission) is clearly defined:\n\nWe are united around a shared mission: to provide the coordination engine that enables a more efficient, secure and egalitarian economy for all blockchain users\n\nBecause Rook is driven to create a more profitable, fair, and secure decentralized economy, our allocation of resources must be directly tied to the granular objectives to accomplish this vision (”mission-based budgeting”). A mission-based budget is less concerned with the detailed revenue and expense line items typically found in a traditional budget. Instead, these classifications are aggregated into a smaller number of line items. By doing so, there is less emphasis on the accuracy of specific items and a greater focus on the overall goals to be achieved.\n\n### Managing for the Long-Term\n\nCurrently, much of the value of Rook DAO can be seen on-chain represented by tokenized assets or tangible assets. To be a public good it will be necessary for RD to grow considerably in terms of part-time and full-time contributors. This means that the growth of non-tangible assets, the value of contributors, will far exceed the on-chain assets that we hold. Without a conservative approach to treasury management, in the form of stablecoins and non-directional assets, a downturn in the market could prevent hiring/compensating the necessary personnel and/or lead to the liquidation of intangible assets in the form of contributors leaving to work elsewhere.\n\nIn addition to making sure we have sufficient, liquid capital to support our contributors, there are numerous benefits to holding a large percentage of our treasury in stables:\n\n* Provides for predictable, safe, and recurring cash flows\n* Yield earned is relatively predictable making budgeting and cash flow forecasting more effective\n* Provides for a greater ability to engage in other M&A activities and strategic partnerships\n* Signals financial soundness to the community, investors, partners and contributors\n* Allows for RD to continue making the necessary investments somewhat agnostic of market conditions\n* Creates a more stable and diversified treasury\n\n### Systematic Execution\n\nBefore attempting to make any material financial transactions, we must ensure that a holistic and systematic approach is taken to view how our mission, risk tolerance, and market forces are interrelated. This is even more important in an industry as volatile and quick-moving as crypto because the opportunity cost of any action is constantly a moving target.\n\nTo ensure that decisions are appropriate for the long term, research and execution must be performed in a way that is reproducible, objective, and are done in relation to clear standards and guidelines that can be understood by all stakeholders. To better foster an environment that honors and encourages this systematic decision-making, the development and use of the following are critical:\n\n* Treasury management framework\n* The expected use of funds by priority level\n* Ratified governance processes and proposal templates\n* Frequent budgets and forecasts\n* Dedicated team of contributors responsible for researching, executing and monitoring treasury operations\n\nIn addition to these broad requirements, a DAO should, at a minimum, define the following:\n\n* Defined fund allocation process\n* Their capital or emergency reserves strategy\n* Classifications of how different investment types are viewed (eg. high risk, strategic partnership, etc.)\n* Minimum requirements any investment must adhere to\n* Minimum IRR (risk-free rate)\n* Asset composition parameters\n\n### Diversification\n\nWhile DAOs are a new organizational structure that does away with the traditional hierarchical management framework, age-old principles such as diversification should still be honored to ensure the continued survival of the organization. DAO treasury diversification ensures that the entity can fund its operations and achieve its mission and objectives. If a DAO is only holding their native token or highly volatile, directional assets, any negative market forces could cripple the organization’s ability to predictably deploy capital and keep talent. Diversification is therefore critical to spread out our risk so that the performance of one investment doesn’t necessarily correlate to the success of our protocol and community.\n\n### Coordinating with Ecosystem Partners to Create Win-Win Outcomes\n\nThe basic objective of a strategic partnership is to achieve synergy through integrated, combined and tailored in-depth cooperation; put another way, it is to achieve an additional joint effect that an individual organization would not be able to achieve on its own, while concrete objectives may be quite different in each individual relationship and for each participant.\n\nWhile building will always be the cornerstone of what we do at Rook, we feel, now more than ever, that buying and partnering are integral components of our growth strategy. Using treasury funds selectively to develop partnerships with complementary stakeholders in our ecosystem allows us to strengthen our technological diversity, knowledge base and market mindshare. Building a portfolio of partnerships rather than a portfolio of investments will almost certainly result in better optimizing return over the long term. While at times we may come across protocols offering higher yield on a deposit, depositing that same asset into a protocol that produces MEV-derived revenues in perpetuity is a much more compelling value proposition.\n\nMore specifically, we look for the following characteristics in partnerships:\n\n* Significant alignment in core values, culture, and mission\n* Significant elements of knowledge and technology are shared or transferred\n* Creates significant awareness of both projects and offers a compelling narrative\n* Creates additional opportunities for networking\n* Organizations complement or supplement skills sets, infrastructure, and processes on both sides\n\n## Looking Forward\n\nThe marriage between community engagement and decentralized governance is providing the world with a new level of organization — one that copes with current social and economic needs and overthrows archaic models based on hierarchies and fragmented power. The future is bright for DAOs and us pioneers that are creating new paradigms in human interaction and value creation. While the path ahead is unknown, scary, and difficult at times, it is one worth taking for future generations. Every DAO should strike a perfect balance between making money and becoming a public good over time.",

In addition to 5 ETH to pay for network fees, the funds requested in relation the current assets held by labs [3] are as follows:\n\n![first](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20image1.png?raw=true)\n\n![second](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20image2.png?raw=true)\n\nBased on the Treasury’s financial position [1], this net funding amount would equate to less than 2% of our stablecoin balance as of September 26, 2022.\n\nNote: While much of the costs requested are expected to fund ongoing programs and initiatives, approximately $403k (or 58% of the requested funds) are anticipated to be used to support the development of new projects and objectives. These anticipated costs are highlighted in more detail in the Key Highlights sections below.\n\n### Recap/Rationale\n\nIn February 2022, the Rook Labs team requested funding through KIP-15 [2] to support the ongoing operations and development of key Rook processes and infrastructure through June 30, 2022. More specifically, this proposal requested an allocation of 3,310 ROOK and $500,500 USDC to be transferred from the Treasury wallet to the Labs wallet.\n\nThe Rook Labs team used this budget to make progress on multiple fronts during the budget period, all of which can be found in the Labs Q2 report [3]. Labs also showed strong financial discipline in their spending, using less than 60% of the budgeted ROOK and approximately 70% of the budgeted USDC for a period longer than budgeted for.\n\nThe “budget-to-actual” tables below provide further detail of this discipline. “Actual” data presented below and pulled from the Lab’s Ledger [6] includes March 2022 as the budgeted amount are for March 1, 2022 through September 26, 2022. The following schedules present the Labs’ utilization of funding vs. what was allocated by the DAO:\n\n![third](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20image3.png?raw=true)\n\nThe following schedules present the outflows by function from the Rook Labs’ dedicated multisig:\n\n![fourth](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20image%204.png?raw=true)\n\n### Term and Total Request\n\nFor what remains of 2022, Labs is budgeting total USDC and ROOK needs of approximately $689k and 1,500 ROOK units, respectively; however, because of the disciplined spending in the prior quarter, there is a large surplus of approximately $129.6k USDC already in the Labs wallet that is expected to offset this funding need by roughly 19%. The net funding amount of approximately $485k is expected to fund Labs through December 31, 2022 (“Budget Period”). The schedule below this reconciliation of budget funds to funds remaining from prior funding cycles:\n\n![fifth](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20image5.png?raw=true)\n\n![sixth](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20image6.png?raw=true)\n\nThe following schedules present the summary of Q3 budgeted costs by both Labs function and cost category:\n\n![seventh](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20image7.png?raw=true)\n\n![ninth](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20image9.png?raw=true)\n\n## Budget Detail: Individual Team Highlights\n\n### Engineering\n![eng table](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20eng.png?raw=true)\n\n  * This team is expected to continue with the current contractor engineer as well as two other new engineers to assist in our internal product development. Each of these contractors is expected to cost $12k each\n  * Dues and Subscriptions is comprised of various ongoing subscriptions, of which AWS is expected to cost $24k.\n  * This team plans on leveraging the community for miscellaneous developer grants by deploying up to $500 per week.\n\n### Growth\n![growth 1](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20growth1.png?raw=true)\n\n![growth 2](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20growth2.png?raw=true)\n  * The majority of budgeted funds ($54k) for this team are expected to be utilized for a sales development representative contributor to help manage the administrative side of the team’s business development (“BD”) initiatives, as well as a Comms/PR specialist.\n  * There are $20k in budgeted funds reserved for conference expenses for the sales team to attend.\n  * It is expected that approximately $6k in requested funds will go towards community grants to assist in the development of research pieces and other content that may aid the BD or operations functions.\n  * The Growh and Operations Team expect to incur approximately $18k for various community and discord improvement projects.\n  * Lastly, the Team is requesting 500 ROOK to support a new user incentive program expected to be created\n\n### Organization\n![org table](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20org.png?raw=true)\n  * The largest set of anticipated expenses expected to be incurred relate to the establishment of more formal legal entities, structures and compliance-based initiatives\n  * Also included in Other Expenses are $26k of costs expected to be incurred in October 2022 to support the Offsite initiative discussed further below.\n  * Budgeted contractor expenses are expected to support the continual funding of an internal governance associate, technical recruiter and another new anticipated contractor expected to support internal organizational operations\n  * Lastly, this team is budgeting $20k for this Budget Period to provide community grants to community members that are expected to work on organizational operations project based work\n\n### Studio\n![studio](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20studio.png?raw=true)\n\n  * The majority of the budgeted expenses for this team relate to paying external parties for various marketing and branding initiatives including:\n    * Content syndications (partnerships)\n    * Speaking opportunity placements\n    * Conference sponsorship\n    * Other marketing and design work\n  * The Studio Team is requesting approximately $23k to continue the Starbased community content service that was initiated in Q2 of 2022.\n  * The remaining funds will primarily be used to fund various contractors to assist on copywriting, graphic design work, and video/content creation\n\n### Treasury\n![tsy](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20tsy.png?raw=true)\n\n  * The majority of the budgeted expenses for this team relate to support two existing contractors that have been assisting on recurring Treasury initiatives. Additionally, the Treasury Team is expecting to use $6k in requested funds to bring in a new contractor to assist on ongoing Treasury efforts.\n  * In addition to these contractors, the Treasury Team also has budgeted to incentivize other community members to support various community based projects.\n  * Other Expenses include $15k in requested funds to support effort to automate the accounting function for both the Treasury and Labs. Lastly, the remaining $3k within this category is expected to be used to support travel and conference expenses.\n\n### Leadership\n![lead 1](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20lead1.png?raw=true)\n\n![lead 2](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20lead2.png?raw=true)\n  * To effectively position the DAO and the protocol to be prepared for the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape, Leadership has earmarked $54k to be leveraged to hire 3 research contractors. These contributors will help develop deep analysis that will aid Leadership in making more effective and efficient decisions.\n  * Other expenses are comprised of a $60k USDC and 1k ROOK discretionary budget. While not strictly defined, these discretionary funds could be leveraged for items such as:\n    * Team deficits as a result of unforeseen circumstances\n    * Activities that require greater levels of confidentiality or speed\n    * Additional incentives to encourage partnerships\n\n## Budget Detail: Highlights\n\n### Q4 Offsite\n\nOccasional face-to-face meetups [7], including a mix of working on real tasks, brainstorming, and getting to know each other, are the lifeblood [8] of distributed teams and are demonstrated to increase productivity through cohesiveness [9].\n\nSome organizations meet up very regularly, up to once a quarter. Given our distributed team, this would not be practical nor financially viable. We will need to calibrate our perfect ratio as we understand our team dynamics more in depth. As initial step, we have started organizing our first full team meeting, taking some non-negotiable design elements into account:\n\n* Key Deliverables: retrospective, prioritization and planning for Q1-Q2 2023; brainstorming session at team and organization level; strengthen human connections, to boost the team ability to deliver.\n* Location: proximity to the majority of team members (to limit cost of travel and cost of jet lag); we opted for a destination in Mexico, as it provides better cost efficiency than locations within the United States.\n* Venue: preference for a single facility with the possibility of cooking own meals and strong wi-fi to be able to work from.\n* Duration: 4-5 nights\n\nThe meetup week will take place October (24th to the 29th). The expected cost breakdown is below.\n\n![offsite](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-34/kip-34%20offsite.png?raw=true)\n\n### ETH Requirements\n\nWe intend to use 5 ETH for network fees incurred during the transfer of grants over the budget period. The increase in ETH funds requested can be attributed to the following factors:\n\n* The new Compensation 3.1 structure requires that the ROOK component of contributor compensation be disbursed to each contributor monthly.\n* With additional contributors and other meaningful activity, we have exhausted budgeted ETH funds quicker than expected in previous quarters. The previous quarter’s funding was utilized in full in approximately 6 weeks, resulting in contributors using personal funds to cover gas costs.\n\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Multisig Implementation\n\nThis budget, if approved, will allow for the transfer of requested funds from the Rook DAO Treasury (0x9a67F1940164d0318612b497E8e6038f902a00a4) to the Rook Labs multisig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006). The current signers of the Rook DAO Labs multisig are:\n\n* @WhatsTheDeetz\n* @Pai-Sho\n* @JZ\n* @Hazard\n\n### Excess ROOK and USDC Rollover\n\nThe budget above represents in all cases an upper bound. It isn’t required that Labs spend all of it, and we do not seek to. If excess ROOK or USDC exists at the end of the budget period, it will carry over into the subsequent budget period unless superceded by another KIP.\nSpecification\n\n1. Transfer, 560,177 USDC, 17 ROOK, and 5 ETH (for gas) from theRook DAO Treasury (0x9a67F1940164d0318612b497E8e6038f902a00a4) to the Rook DAO Labs multi-sig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006).\n2. As appropriate, provide funding from the Rook DAO Labs multi-sig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006) to meet the needs outlined above during the budget period. \n3. Ensure proper recordkeeping to provide for ongoing review of any transactions by the DAO on the public Labs Ledger [5].\n4. Continue to provide detailed quarterly reporting to the DAO on expenses and revenues.\n",

However there are a number of reasons for the DAO to prefer to keep its BTC holdings in WBTC at this time. \n\nAs of August 26, 2022, WBTC is far more liquid, with a circulating supply of 247,760 WBTC, more than 73 times higher than the total supply of 3,394 renBTC. WBTC also experiences far greater daily trading volumes, more than $250,000,000, 31 times higher than the $8,000,000 of volume traded in renBTC [**2,3**]. \n\nRecent regulatory developments have made it clear that the potential exists for eager regulators to impose controls that could render the DAO unable to recover the underlying BTC from a wrapped asset. In such a scenario, liquidity on a secondary market would be an important factor for recovering the value of the wrapped asset for the DAO. Given this, we cannot ignore the vast disparity in liquidity between these two derivatives of BTC.\n\nThe DAO Treasury originally held renBTC in order to seed the renBTC liquidity pool, which helped incentivize renBTC liquidity and volume by enabling zero-cost flash loans with the asset. This was done in line with our longstanding partnership with the Ren protocol, a partnership that continues today. \n\nHowever with the sunsetting of the Rook liquidity pools **[4]**, and the removal of DAO Treasury renBTC liquidity from them **[4],** our thoughts must turn towards long-term risk management as the primary measure of any reserve asset.\n\n### Expected benefits for Rook\n\nThe expected benefits of this proposal are as follows:\n\n- Increased liquidity in the event the DAO chooses, or is driven by necessity, to liquidate the asset.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Execution\n\nSee the “Specification” section for execution details. \n\n### Monitoring and Reporting\n\nThe Treasury will continue to monitor the position as part of its ongoing monitoring of the DAO’s portfolio. \n\n## Specification\n\nSpecific steps to be taken, in bullet point form\n\n- DAO Treasury (0x9a67f1940164d0318612b497e8e6038f902a00a4) to send the approximately 40.672 renBTC to execution wallet (0xa41164009fa1021ac3cff34813e461ca445d0712) controlled by CTO to execute swap\n- Exchange the approximately 40.672 renBTC in the DAO Treasury for an equivalent amount of WBTC at prevailing market prices using the Rook Protocol ([https://app.rook.fi/en/trade](https://app.rook.fi/en/trade))\n- Return funds from execution wallet (9fa1021ac3cff34813e461ca445d0712) to DAO Treasury (0x9a67f1940164d0318612b497e8e6038f902a00a4)\n- Rook rewards generated from the swap will be claimed and transferred to the Treasury at a later point\n- Report back to DAO the results of the swap",

That process has to date operated without stated rules around which holders of ROOK can vote and which can’t. In practice, only those holding ROOK in Snapshot-compatible wallets were able to vote their ROOK until recently, when voting was expanded to include those holding xROOK (ROOK staked on the protocol’s native staking contract). This expansion gave each xROOK the equivalent of 1 ROOK of voting power, regardless of the typically larger economic weight accorded to each xROOK within the staking contract. The rationale for this change was to leave any changes to the voting weight of xROOK to be tuned through the governance process. \n\nMore recently, Rook’s developers have identified smart contract additions available within Snapshot that - if used - could expand voting to include ROOK that are staked on Uniswap, Sushi and Bancor. Use of these contracts has been discussed in Governance Workshop but have yet to be ratified through Rook governance. \n\n## Summary\n\nThis document proposes to accomplish two things: \n\n- Establish and ratify a set of formats for ROOK holdings to be formally included in Rook governance votes\n- Establish and ratify an initial (and tunable) set of voting weights for each format\n\nThis proposal envisions subsequent amendments (via Rook governance) as the voting weights and number of holding formats change with DAO member preferences. \n\n## Proposal Detail\n\nThis document proposes to expand eligibility for voting to ROOK tokens staked in liquidity pools on the following platforms: \n\n- Bancor v3 [3]\n- Sushiswap AMM [4]\n- Uniswap v2 [5]\n- Rook native staking (xROOK) [6]\n\nDoing so will require identifying (or, if necessary, writing) the appropriate voting contract or (in Snapshot’s terms) “strategy” and then implementing those strategies in Rook’s Snapshot account. Snapshot currently offers strategies for each of the three external liquidity platforms where ROOK are staked: Bancor v3 [6], SushiSwap [7] and Uniswap v2 [8]. *NB: Cited strategies for SushiSwap and Uniswap are indicative only, and may change.* \n\nThe dev team have also developed a Snapshot strategy for reweighting the voting power of xROOK [9]. That strategy includes an adjustable parameter for tuning the voting power given to each xROOK using a voting coefficient that in turn multiplies the staking coefficient, or the number of ROOK equivalents represented by each xROOK in the staking contract. This design makes it possible to tune the voting and staking weights of xROOK separately. \n\nThis document proposes to set the voting coefficient for xROOK to 1, meaning that each xROOK would receive voting power equal to the number of ROOK equivalents established by the staking coefficient. The staking coefficient is defined by the “xRookUnderlyingConversion” parameter in the ROOK staking contract [10]. That weight is 1.058721221017144 as of 2022-08-24, but is not fixed at that level. \n\nOnce enacted, these changes will result in the following voting participation and power for holders of ROOK in various forms: \n\n| Token | Holding format | Current Voting Weight | Proposed Voting Weight |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ROOK | Web-based wallet | 1 | 1 |\n| xROOK | Staked with Rook | 1 | xROOK staking weight |\n| ROOK | Staked on Uniswap v2 | 0 | 1 |\n| ROOK | Staked on SushiSwap AMM  | 0 | 1 |\n| bnROOK | Staked on Bancor v3 | 0 | 1 |\n\n## Mission alignment and rationale\n\nThe motivation for this document is to bring practice and codified process into alignment around an expanded and governance-defined set of voting rights for holders of ROOK across major formats. This proposal is aligned with the DAO’s values of progressive decentralization in its potential to further decentralize voting concentration by bringing more tokenholders into the voting process. It also gives a voice in the governance process to those providing liquidity for ROOK on important DeFi platforms. \n\n## Specification\n\n- Deploy the following strategies on Rook’s Snapshot page:\n    - Deploy the *xrook-balance-of-underlying-weighted* [9] strategy, with ”weight” parameter set to 1\n    - Deploy the *bancor-pool-token-underlying-balance* [6] strategy\n    - Identify and deploy the most appropriate SushiSwap strategy\n    - Identify and deploy the most appropriate Uniswap strategy\n- Document strategies used in Rook's Governance repository in Github \n- Report back to the DAO when these strategies have been implemented\n- Use these strategies and weights for all votes until changed by a subsequent KIP",

While this volume has created a wealth of information and metrics (see Dune dashboard **[1]**) about the activity occurring within the Rook Protocol, it has been driven mainly by external parties whose strategies we as a DAO have no control over. All internal testing has been mainly geared towards assessing the soundness of the protocol rather than to investigate profitable strategies. So that we may better understand the potential for such strategies, we must put in the work of exploring and capturing their potential ourselves, so that we can offer them to others who follow.\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish a sandbox with which we can implement and monitor the profitability of passive trading strategies using the Rook Protocol. Specifically, this KIP proposes to:\n\n1. Establish a new delegated 2 of 3 multisig (the \"Strategy Testing Wallet\").\n2. Fund the wallet using assets from the DAO Treasury (the \"Budgeted Funds\").\n3. Empower a working group of key contributors (the \"Delegated Team\") to use the Strategy Testing Wallet to develop and test novel strategies using the Rook Protocol.\n\n### Nature of Powers to be Delegated\n\nThis proposal delegates power over the Strategy Testing Wallet controlling the Budgeted Funds to the Delegated Team. Additionally, this proposal empowers the Delegated Team to swap exclusively between Approved Assets at their discretion, using the Rook Protocol. Approved Assets consist of:\n\n* USDC\n* DAI\n* USDT\n* FRAX\n\nThese assets will be used to execute 1:1 limit orders between approved stablecoins on the Rook Protocol. This ensures that the number of units of each asset will be preserved, with the only risk being the devaluation of one or more due to loss of peg. We will monitor the frequency and profitability of each swap, the amount of ROOK that each yields, and investigate the potential for offering the strategy as a product.\n\n### Term of Delegation\n\nThe powers as defined above will stay in effect until 180 days post-ratification of this proposal, at which point funds will be returned to the treasury multisig. The results of the study will also be published with a comprehensive, data-driven report.\n\n### Budget\n\nTo effectively gather sufficient data, a base amount of each stablecoin is needed. Additionally, 1 ETH is being requested to accommodate gas fees for fund transfers and rewards claiming. More specifically, this document proposes the transfer of the following amounts (“Budgeted Funds”):\n\n|Asset|Amount (Units)|\n| --- | --- |\n|USDC|150,000|\n|DAI|150,000|\n|USDT|150,000|\n|FRAX|150,000|\n|ETH|1|\n|Total Funds Requested|600,000$ + 1 ETH|\n\n### Mission Alignment and Rationale\n\nOur goal here at Rook is to be on the cutting edge of blockchain technology and DeFi thought leadership. To accomplish this goal, we must constantly be evolving our product suite, capabilities, and mindshare in the ecosystem. For this ongoing evolution to occur, we must gather as much data about our current and future strengths and weaknesses from a product standpoint; data is power.\n\nInternally, a need has been identified to analyze the effects of HidingBook-native stablecoin liquidity on order execution and routing efficiency for users and Keepers. By ratifying this proposal, we enable ourselves to rapidly and efficiently capture this data and utilize it to more effectively evolve the Rook Protocol.\n\n### Expected Benefits for Rook\n\nThe expected benefits derived from this proposal are as follows:\n\n* Enables collection of data that will assist Rook Labs in:\n  * Developing new trading strategies to increase future revenues\n  * Gaining insight into the effects of native HidingBook stablecoin liquidity on Keeper routing opportunities and order execution efficiency\n  * Understanding the viability of future products we can offer to integration partners and other external parties\n  * Developing data-driven marketing content displaying the power of the Rook Protocol\n  * Identifying potential areas of improvement within the Rook Protocol\n\n### Potential Risks and Mitigation\n\nAs with all investments, the benefits earned come with numerous risks that are both financial and non-financial in nature. These risks and related mitigations should be assessed by the DAO in conjunction with the benefits stated above and would include:\n\n|Risk|Related Mitigation|\n| --- | --- |\n|Smart Contract Risk|All testing will be done exclusively through the Rook Protocol which has been thoroughly audited and battle-tested.|\n|Stablecoin Risk|All 4 of the proposed stablecoin assets are relatively low-risk in terms of depegging. See stablecoin research **[3]**|\n|Loss of funds via fraud or mismanagement|Funds will be held in a delegated 2-of-3 multisig controlled by the Delegated Team, who are all full-time contributors to the DAO.|\n|Fragmentation of liquidity|The budgeted amount requested is relatively immaterial (~1% of Treasury holdings **[2]** as of 2022-07-07). Because the Delegated Team consists of full-time contributors to the DAO, these funds will be readily available to send back to the DAO Treasury when needed.|\n|Opportunity cost|The insight derived from the availability of new data with respect to new trading strategies, marketing potential, and general improvement of the protocol is expected to far outweigh the potential yield gained through depositing these assets into an external protocol.|\n\n### Delegated Team\n\nThe full-time contributors to be delegated the powers in this proposal are:\n\n|Contributor|Signing Address|\n| --- | --- |\n|@Deetz|0x722f531740937fc21A2FaC7648670C7f2872A1c7|\n|@Pai-Sho|0xDAAf6D0ab259053Bb601eeE69880F30C7d8e5853|\n|@Zakhtar|0x3C3ca4E5AbF0C1Bec701375ff31342d90D8C435E|\n\n### Oversight and Recourse\n\nTo ensure the proper stewardship of the funds managed by the Delegated Team, the Treasury Team will monitor the utilization of these funds and report back to the DAO on at least a monthly basis. Additionally, the wallet’s address will be made public so that any interested parties can assess the activity in real time. A public dashboard along with a Hiding Book viewer will be made available by the Treasury Team and the Protocol Team to better assist interested parties in evaluating the metrics and trading history in real-time.\n\nLastly, the Delegated Team will strive to provide reasonable insight into the nature and results of testing being performed as it becomes available.\n\n## Specification\n\n* Create a new 2-of-3 multisig Strategy Testing Wallet and publicly announce the address of the wallet\n* Add the Delegated Team as signers of the Strategy Testing Wallet multisig\n* Empower the Treasury multisig (0x9a67f1940164d0318612b497e8e6038f902a00a4) to deploy the budgeted funds as defined above to the Strategy Testing Wallet within 30 days of ratification of this proposal\n* Delegated Team begins testing Approved Assets within Rook Protocol at their discretion\n",

Delegating this responsibility to a Delegated Team will allow our governance process to focus on more critical proposals. This proposal aims to provide discretion to the Delegated Team to manage non-core asset positions under the amount of $100,000. Powers granted to the Delegated Team include unstaking, claiming rewards, and swapping assets whose total value in USD is below the $100,000 cap. In the event the team decides to swap or liquidate a non-core asset, the resulting funds are required to be core assets.\n\nThe table below shows current non-core asset holdings in the Rook Treasury as of July 13, 2022 [1]. Of these, the ALCX position is part of a strategic partnership.\n\n|Asset|Units|Dollar Amount|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|vlCVX|372,814.74|$2,311,451.38|\n|cvxCRV|17,204.39|$16,970.73|\n|LDO|7,946.87|$6,708.18|\n|FXS|3,415.29|$16,222.63|\n|ALCX|5,355.28|$115,781.23|\n|RAI|201.38|$594.06|\n\n## Nature of Powers to be Delegated\n\nThis proposal gives the Delegated Team discretion to manage non-core Treasury assets under the amount of $100,000. This proposal defines non-core assets as tokens that DO NOT meet one of the following criteria:\n\n* Current Treasury core asset holdings:\n  * ROOK\n  * ETH\n  * WETH\n  * renBTC\n  * DAI\n  * USDC\n* Tokens received from strategic partnerships [2].\n\nThe Delegated Team will have the discretion to swap non-core asset positions of under $100,000 into one or more of the core assets. Non-core asset positions that carry a value above the $100,000 cap will be subject to the full governance process.\n\nThis proposal delegates discretionary management powers that are unrelated to the powers and limits ratified by KIP 23 [3].\n\nIn addition, this proposal provides a more general framework for revenue generated from KIP-5 [4]. It is intended to capture most if not all bribes received from our vlCVX position, the bulk of which are paid to Rook DAO in unrelated tokens in amounts well below the $100,000 limit established in this proposal. However, when the bribe revenue exceeds the $100,000 threshold or is the result of a strategic partnership, the management of those assets will be subject to the standard governance process.\n\n## Term of Delegation\n\nThis proposal is intended to be in effect for as long as the Rook Treasury includes non-core assets or until a future proposal supersedes the powers granted in this document.\n\n## Mission Alignment and Rationale\n\nNon-core Treasury assets, that are not related to strategic investments, do not contribute to the mission of Rook Protocol. These assets can be the result of airdrops, Convex bribes earned as a result of KIP-5 [4], or token rewards from other activities. All of the pieces that make up Rook DAO should be aligned with the core values of Rook’s mission, including the Treasury. The goal of the Rook Treasury is to ensure that operations of the DAO are ongoing, sustainable, and resilient to market volatility. As such, the main focus of the Treasury Charter is to ensure that decisions are being made to support the contributors, capture market share and support key infrastructure of the DAO [5].\n\nThe reasoning for delegating this responsibility is to help eliminate noise on our governance forum. Proposals relating to non-core assets are not directly aligned with the mission of Rook DAO and have the potential to detract from more critical governance functions.\n\n## Expected Benefits for Rook\n\nAllowing for the creation of a Delegated Team, whose focus is to rebalance non-core assets under the amount of $100,000, will give the DAO increased flexibility. As it currently stands, a decision regarding our non-core assets would be required to go through our governance process. Subjecting decisions, about non-core assets, to the full governance process will be time consuming and can detract from critical governance proposals.\n\nOther Potential Benefits\n\n* This proposal allows for timely decisions to be made that take advantage of optimal pricing. (ex. airdrops)\n* Contributes to the formalization of our overall treasury management framework\n\n## Potential Risks and Mitigation\n\nExecution risk in making these swaps will be mitigated through the use of Rook limit orders. There is a minor “risk” that the Treasury will miss the benefits of any appreciation in these non-core positions, but these positions are too small to have a material impact and seeking such appreciation is less critical than maintaining strong positions in core, known assets.\n\n# Implementation\n\n## Execution and Position Management\n\nThe discretionary sale of the non-core assets under the threshold will be the responsibility of the Delegated Team, with the execution being performed by the multi-sig signers. Non-core assets that are sold as a result of this proposal must be converted into one or more of the core assets listed above.\n\n## Monitoring and Reporting\n\nThe Delegated Team will be responsible for communicating their decisions to the DAO. Updates, from the Delegated Team, will be communicated at Treasury Tuesdays with an accompanying written summary of the transaction.\n\n## Delegated Team\n\n@DaddyMatty - Treasury Specialist\n@Stubbs - Data Analyst\n@Starfire - DeFi analyst\n\n# Specification\n\n* Empower Delegated Team to manage non-core Treasury assets of less than $100,000 by swapping them into core assets, at the Team’s discretion.\n",

That position was motivated in part by Bancor’s promise of impermanent loss protection (ILP) on single-sided staked assets. Bancor has recently turned off this feature for an indefinite period of time due to the effects of an unexpected sell-off of BNT reward emissions. [2].\n\nThe current market environment requires diligent risk management and healthy liquidity for core Treasury assets such as ROOK. These recent developments at Bancor make it no longer wise to keep treasury assets there. This proposal seeks to address these risks by empowering the Official Team to initiate an immediate migration of Rook’s liquidity position on Bancor from v2 to v3, and then to withdraw our holdings of ROOK and return them to the Treasury.\n\n### Investment amount and type\n\nOther (specify) - migration and removal of liquidity.\n\n### Mission Alignment\n\nThe withdrawal of our single-sided liquidity position from Bancor is an effort to control our third-party risk exposure. The Treasury Charter states investments “must be managed in relation to each other in the aggregate including consideration of protocol risks, opportunity costs, lockup periods, etc.” [3] The current market conditions warrant conservative actions, and it is beneficial for the DAO to consolidate our liquidity and minimize overall risk.\n\n### Expected benefits for Rook\n\nRemoving our single-sided liquidity position from Bancor will allow the DAO to consolidate its total liquidity and mitigate third-party risk for the DAO. The ROOK received from our Bancor position can be utilized in future initiatives.\n\n## Analysis\n\n### General\n\nIn December 2021, KIP-11 [2] empowered the DAO to co-invest 6,400 ROOK into the ROOK-BNT pool on Bancor. Bancor is known for its impermanent loss (IL) protection, but as of June 19th, 2022, they have temporarily suspended the service. Currently, liquidity providers can withdraw from Bancor without IL protection or wait until Bancor resumes the service. The timeframe for the suspension of Bancor’s IL protection is unknown. Given this uncertainty and the current market environment, it is prudent to proceed with the migration and withdrawal of our liquidity position. The migration from v2 to v3 is a required step in the Bancor withdrawal process. Removing our LP position on Bancor will allow the DAO to consolidate our third-party risk exposure and provide an opportunity to re-strategize how we deploy ROOK liquidity.\n\n### Expected Return\n\nThe expected return is difficult to set in this case given the same lack of information that is motivating this proposal to withdraw. The potential upside is a full return of the 6,400 ROOK that we staked with Bancor, though that is impossible to estimate with the information provided.\n\n### Potential Risks and Mitigation\n\n* This proposal is intended to address the primary risk in Rook’s position with Bancor, which is impermanent loss risk. It is possible our position on Bancor has experienced significant IL. Bancor pairs all assets with BNT and the unexpected sell-off of BNT rewards resulted in impermanent loss across the Bancor system.\n* There is a possibility that Bancor resumes the ILP service but playing a waiting game incurs opportunity cost. The DAO’s position may suffer more if left intact.\n* Bancor has Rook limit orders on their platform and by pulling the DAO’s liquidity position it may damage the relationship.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Execution\n\nThe Official Team will research and establish the timeframe for execution. Once established, the migration of assets from Bancor v2 to Bancor v3 and the subsequent removal of our liquidity position will be executed by the multi-sig holders as determined by the Official Team.\n\n### Position Management\n\nOnce withdrawn, the ROOK will be returned to the DAO’s Treasury and will become part of its ongoing ROOK position.\n\n### Monitoring and Reporting\n\nUpdates regarding the status and completion of this proposal will be provided during Treasury Tuesdays.\n\n### Official Team and Disclosure\n\n@DaddyMatty- Treasury Specialist\n\n@starfire- Defi Analyst\n\n@whatsthedeetz, Growth Lead\n\n## Specification\n\n* Initiate the migration and withdrawal of Rook’s total position on Bancor to 0x9a67f1940164d0318612b497e8e6038f902a00a4 (“Rook DAO Treasury”)\n* Report back to DAO on completion of these transactions",

This KIP proposes to extend the same powers articulated in those proposals.  \n\n### Term of delegation\n\nThis proposal will last for the six months ending December 31, 2022, unless superseded by another KIP prior to that date. \n\n### Budget\n\nThere is no anticipated budget to fund this proposal beyond that established in Rook’s quarterly budgeting process. \n\n### Mission Alignment and Rationale\n\nThe leadership team has driven a complete reorganization of the DAO’s contributorship, the delivery of major protocol and product developments and the building of a cohesive and high-performance organization during the first six months of 2022 [3,4]. This proposal is intended to empower them to complete the promised cycle of work first formalized in KIP-12 [1] by finalizing the organizational and legal structure, technology and other necessary upgrades necessary.\n\n### Expected benefits for Rook\n\nContinuity in leadership will be essential for Rook as a whole to realize the potential of the transformations initiated in the first half of 2022. Keeping current leadership in place will enable Rook to reach the goals for Q3 and beyond as set out in Rook’s Q2 quarterly report [4].\n\n### Potential risks and mitigation\n\nContinuing to delegate these powers to hazard and JZ could pose potential risks to the DAO given the concentration of authority.  The fundamental mitigation of this risk is in the temporary nature of this proposal. This KIP is intended to provide time-limited authority to complete the governance and organizational reforms described in the Q2 report [4]. Those reforms will include frameworks that establish ongoing structures for authority and accountability that, once debated with and ratified by the community, will eliminate the need for further extensions such as this KIP. \n\nThis KIP also proposes to introduce measures of transparency that encourage community review and monitoring of the activities of the DAO under the team’s leadership. In part this will happen through a commitment to building in public whenever possible, and where unable to do that, to committing to consistent reporting of progress.\n\nEffective reporting will require some combination of written updates, periodic community meetings to discuss progress, and potentially the development of public-facing sites that allow anyone to track that progress. While the precise mix will likely change with the cadence of developments across Rook, the leadership is required by this proposal to establish and have begun implementing a publicly documented communication strategy and schedule for maintaining transparency within three weeks of ratification.\n\n### Oversight and Recourse\n\nThe leadership will operate under the review of the Sophons as established in KIP-12 [1]. The community also retains several forms of recourse. In the event that the community comes to consensus that leadership’s actions no longer have their trust, they could take any of the following actions:\n\n- Convene an “all hands on deck” community call with the leadership team to address specific issues\n- Unwind the authorities granted in this proposal through a formal KIP\n\n### Delegated Team\n\nThe leadership team members to be delegated the powers in this proposal are: \n\n- @hazard, CEO\n- @JZ, CTO\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Extend KIP-21 until the end of 2022, that is, midnight UTC on 31 December, 2022\n2. Within three weeks of ratification, develop and begin to deliver on publicly documented communication strategy.",

The USDC portion of our deposits will be maintained as USDC, with the MPL portion being swapped into USDC through the Rook Protocol.\n\n## References\n\n[1] [KIP-6 forum post](https://forum.rook.fi/t/kip-6-yield-generation-on-maple-finance/157/13)\n[2] [Rook’s Current Maple Position](https://dune.com/0x_stubbs/Rook-Ecosystem)\n[3] [FT article: Three Arrows Capital Margin Call](https://www.ft.com/content/126d8b02-f06a-4fd9-a57b-9f4ceab3de71)\n[4] [Coindesk article: Celsius Functional Insolvency](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/16/how-crypto-lender-celsius-overheated/)\n\n## Background\n\n### Summary \nGiven volatility in markets and emergent risks in the position, after careful evaluation, the multisig signers have taken the decision to initiate a withdrawal of all USDC and related earnings deposited with Maple Finance per KIP-6 [1]. This is a risk-management decision motivated by risks of potential market contagion rather than a view on Maple Finance in isolation. There is a 10-day processing period between initiation of a withdrawal and its enactment, and in this period the DAO will have the ability to make a collective decision, without unnecessarily delaying the withdrawal process.\n\nAll subsequent information relates to data as of June 16, 2022 (“Proposal Date”).\n\n### Investment amount and type\n\nAs outlined in KIP-6, the Maple Finance position was initiated for the purpose of yield generation. Rook’s position with Maple was $3.563 million USDC and $108.9k MPL as of Proposal Date [2].\n\n### Expected benefits for Rook\n\nThe expected benefits of this proposal are as follows:\n\n* Protection from locking or loss of Treasury funds due to market contagion\n* Recognition and realization of earnings totaling $187.6 as of Proposal Date\n  * MPL Rewards: $108.9k [2]\n  * USDC Rewards: $78.7k [2]\n* Ability to monitor Maple Finance and the broader market for developments and opportunities while reducing risk to our stablecoins\n\n## Analysis and Rationale\n\nMarket conditions have shifted powerfully since this position was established in 2021, most recently and dramatically with the rumored collapse of several centrally connected market actors such as Three Arrows Capital and Celsius [3,4]. While Maple Finance is not one of those actors, and our analysis of that protocol in itself has not changed, Maple’s status as a leading undercollateralized lending platform has led us, out of an abundance of caution, to recall our deposits.\n\nWe feel this is prudent risk management given the need to protect our Treasury’s viability and ability to support ongoing operations. The speed of market developments makes this move unusually urgent.\n\n## Implementation\n\n### Execution\n\nExecution will be a withdrawal by the Treasury multisig of all Treasury assets on Maple Finance, executed as described in Specification below.\n\n### Monitoring and Reporting\n\nThe Treasury multisig will report to the DAO upon completion of the trade, which will end with the return of the USDC and MPL to the Treasury portfolio.\n\n## Specification\n\nSpecific steps to be taken, in bullet point form\n\n* Proceed with withdrawal of total USDC deposits and related earnings ($3.563m) to 0x9a67f1940164d0318612b497e8e6038f902a00a4 (“Rook DAO Treasury”)\n* Proceed with the withdrawal total MPL earnings ($108.9k) to the Rook DAO treasury\n* Swap total withdrawn MPL earnings into USDC using the Rook Protocol ($108.9k) and maintain in the Rook DAO treasury\n* Report back to DAO on completion of these transactions\n\n### Note\n\nThree Arrows Capital was an early investor in KeeperDAO, and has had minimal contact with our organization since that time.\n",

[stETH/ETH on Curve](https://curve.fi/steth)\n\n# Background\n\nAs of June 1, 2022, Rook DAO holds a total of 10,537 ETH [1] that is currently not productive and not accruing additional yield. These holdings can be broken down as follows:\n\n|Asset|Units|\n| --- | --- |\n|ETH|5,953|\n|WETH|3,838|\n|KWETH|787|\n|Total|10,578|\n\nThis KIP proposes to deploy a maximum of 7,934 ETH, or 75% of Rook DAO's total ETH position as of June 1, 2022 across three liquid staking protocols: Stakewise, Rocket Pool and Lido. While the amounts will vary as the Official Team responds to market conditions, the baseline allocation derived from our modeling would be as follows:\n\n|Protocol/Product|Max Amount (Units)|% of Total|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Stakewise|3,137|39.54%|\n|Rocket Pool|2,768|34.88%|\n|Lido|2,030|25.58%|\n|Total|7,934|100%|\n\nThis baseline allocation between the selected investments is based on a scorecard methodology developed by the Official Team that weighed key attributes and KPI’s of these protocols in relation to one another. Critical factors that materially impacted our proposed allocations to these assets were:\n\n* Stakewise has agreed to provide an advance on 50% of one year’s staking fee, or 5% of the earnings on staked ETH, in SWISE tokens upon staking funds. Assuming RD stakes 3,317 ETH at an average staking yield of 8%, this would result in an additional $22.5k in net revenues. \n* Rocket Pool is the newest platform and therefore is the least battle tested.\n* Lido is the dominant provider of liquid ETH staking, with a roughly 90% market share as of June 1, 2022. [2] While the protocol scored well enough in our research to merit an allocation in this proposal, we also believe that both Rook's treasury and the broader Ethereum ecosystem would benefit from limiting this level of concentration. This led us to propose slightly larger exposures to the other two protocols relative to Lido.\n\n# Official Team\n\nThis proposal was developed by the following members of Rook DAO.\n\n* DaddyMatty - Labs Treasury Specialist\n* Starfire - DeFi Analyst\n* Stubbs - Treasury Analyst\n* Wes2 - Moderator\n* Breeze - Moderator\n\nThis proposal establishes these same members as the Official Team responsible for the execution and monitoring of the staking investments articulated in this proposal, subject to oversight by and reporting to the Rook DAO as established below.\n\n# Investment Analysis\n\nThe analysis supporting this proposal proceeded through two stages: analysis of individual protocols, and the development of a scorecard-based allocation to each. We describe each of these further below.\n\n## Protocol Analysis\n\nThe Official Team evaluated the liquid staking landscape using a combination of metrics and sourcing : Trustlessness/Concentration, Tokenomics, Security/risks, and Composability/Liquidity. These metrics gave context to the different trade-offs between liquid staking providers and allowed the team to discern the protocols aligned with Rook’s best interests. More detail on this research is available in both the main text of the proposal as well as in the protocol-specific research reports at [4], [8], [12].\n\n\n## Allocation Methodology\n\nTo determine the allocations to the selected investments, the Official Team used a scorecard methodology to weigh each of the protocols’ key attributes and KPI’s in relation to one another. The team used following attributes in this analysis:\n\nTrustlessness & Asset Concentration\n\n* Decentralization - Is the protocol fully permissionless? What is the structure of the DAO? How are node operators onboarded?\n* ETH Concentration - What is the protocol’s commitment to client diversity? Is the protocol committed to maintaining the decentralization of Ethereum?\n* Node Count - How many individual node operators has the protocol onboarded? What client is the node operator running?\n\nTokenomics\n\n* APR - What is the annual percentage return for staking?\n* Reward Asset - How are the accrued rewards paid out? Does the protocol use a single token model or a dual token model? Is the reward pool socialized?\n* Fee - What is the fee on accrued rewards?\n* Inflation - Does the token reward model introduce elements of inflation at the expense of stakers?\n\nSecurity & Risk\n\n* Audits Performed - How many audits has the protocol received? Are the audit firms reputable?\n* Bug Bounties Offered - Are there any bounties the protocol has offered to the public in order to incentivize individuals to find bugs?\n* Length of Operation - How long has the protocol offered liquid staking?\n* Slashing Insurance - Does the liquid staking service offer native protection for slashing penalties?\n\nComposability & Liquidity\n\n* Total Value Locked in Liquidity Pools - What are the main venues for trading the liquid staking derivative? Is there sufficient liquidity for Rook DAO to exit the position?\n* Additional Yield Opportunities - Is the liquid staking derivative integrated in protocols across the DeFi space? Are there additional opportunities for Rook DAO to increase the yield of the position?\n\n### Scoring and Allocations\n\nUsing the attributes referenced above, we then determined a weighting scale that reflected our assessment of the relevant importance of each attribute. We then scored each option on each attribute and weighted its total score as a percent of the grand total to establish a recommended allocation of funds.\n\n|Max Score|Attribute|Rocket Pool|Lido|Stakewise|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|35|Trustlessness/Concentration|35|5|25|\n|30|Tokenomics|20|15|30|\n|20|Security/Risks|15|20|20|\n|15|Composability/Liquidity|5|15|10|\n||Total Score|75|55|85|\n||Allocation Weight|34.88%|25.58%|39.53%|\n\n\nMechanistically following the scorecard’s output would translate into the following allocations of ETH: \n\n|Protocol/Product|Max Amount (ETH)|% of Total Staked|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|Stakewise|3,137|39.54%|\n|Rocket Pool|2,768|34.88%|\n|Lido|2,030|25.58%|\n|Total|7,934|100%|\n\nWhile these recommendations will remain a primary input into allocation decisions by the Official Team, the volatility of the current market landscape in general - and the current situation around stETH in particular - necessitates some flexibility to adapt to changes. Because of this, these amounts represent a baseline allocation between the 3 protocols; the Official Team can choose to change these allocations to take advantage of changes to key criteria used to monitor these positions.\n\n## Financial Analysis\n\n### Expected Return\n\nBased on a total initial, maximum investment of 7,934 ETH and assuming stable APYs and an average ETH price of $1,800, Rook DAO can expect to earn $575,028 or 319.46 ETH in the first year with the allocations above. The schedule below presents the anticipated rewards by protocol/product:\n\n|Protocol/ Product|APY*|Annual Reward (Units)|Additional Incentives|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Stakewise|4.04%|126.73 ETH|5% SWISE Incentive|\n|Rocket Pool|4.03%|111.53 ETH|None|\n|Lido|4.00%|81.2 ETH|None|\n|Total||319.46 ETH|5% SWISE Incentive|\n\n*APYs listed here is as of June 1, 2022 [4][8][12]\n\nFactors that may impact these forecasted returns include:\n\n* Changes to ETH’s price\n* Changes to APYs of staking protocols\n* Total ETH market volume and conditions\n* Adverse movements in SWISE price\n* Number of active stakers\n* Timing of the merge to POS ETH\n* Changes to staking and ETH protocol tokenomics\n\nIn addition to the yield gained from the staked assets, Stakewise has agreed to provide half of RD’s anticipated staking fees for one year (or 5% of the earnings of the ETH Rook DAO stakes on their platform)  in SWISE tokens upon staking funds. Assuming Rook DAO stakes 3,317 ETH at an average staking yield of 8%, this would result in an additional $22.5k in net revenues upon staking of funds. Although Stakewise has not relayed any lockup period for these funds, the Official Team recommends that Rook DAO through this proposal commit to not selling any SWISE tokens for 120 days after staking with Stakewise to establish good faith with the Stakewise community. Assuming prices remain consistent for both the SWISE incentives and the ETH earned, this would bring the total expected income from these investments to $597,528. \n\nNote: it is expected that yield derived from staking ETH will significantly improve post-merge. These yields are expected to be anywhere between 8-15%. Because the timing of the merge to PoS ETH is unknown we have excluded these returns from this analysis. \n\n### Risks\n\nAs with all investments, the benefits earned come with numerous risks that are both financial and non-financial in nature. These risks should be assessed by the Official Team in conjunction with the potential returns and would include:\n\n* Smart contract risk\n* Protocol business risk\n* Market conditions and directional asset exposure\n* Opportunity cost\n* Execution risk during Ethereum’s transition from PoW to PoS\n* Protocol concentration\n\nProtocol concentration risk will be managed in light of the established maximums from the allocation process.\n\n## Execution and Management\n\n### Implementation\n\nActual execution to deploy these funds will be performed by the Treasury Multisig (0x9a67f1940164d0318612b497e8e6038f902a00a4). The treasury will make its best effort to deploy these funds within 120 days of adoption of this proposal, consistent with its ongoing commitment to minimizing the risk of market speculation and front-running Upon completion, an update will be announced on Discord and Twitter with the full transaction details.\n\n### Position Maintenance and Unwinding\n\nFull management of the positions will be at the collaborative discretion of the Rook Labs and the Official Team as outlined above, with execution being performed by the Treasury Multisig. While management of the position will be at the discretion of the Official Team, this team will communicate current results and planned actions on a weekly basis. Additionally, a dune dashboard monitoring these investments in real time. This allows for agile response and risk management while also continuing to minimize the speculative and front-running risks described above.\n\nReview: The liquid staking assets will be subject to a formal review and analysis 90 days after full deployment has been completed. The goal of this review is to assess the productivity of the positions and communicate the findings to the DAO.\n\nExiting the Position: This proposal imposes no timeframes on when and how to unwind the position. Full management of the position will be at the collaborative discretion of the Rook DAO Labs and the Official Team involved in drafting the KIP.\n\n# Specification\n\n* Stake 7,934 ETH into Stakewise, Rocket Pool and Lido in amounts described above\n* Treasury Multisig (0x9a67f1940164d0318612b497e8e6038f902a00a4) to deploy assets and make best effort to do so within 120 days of adoption\n* Official team to report weekly to community along with real-time dashboard",

To ensure these opportunities are not lost due to poor execution or front running, Rook Labs must have some discretion to utilize funds without going through the governance process.\n\nMore specifically, this KIP proposes that Rook Labs be empowered to make investments up to the lesser of $5M or 5% of the treasury’s notional value every 180 days. Note: the limits around discretionary investments are cumulative in that the ROOK team would not be able to execute five separate $1M transactions to avoid going through governance.\n\nTo ensure proper due care and diligence was performed, the ROOK team must present their rationale to the DAO within 48 hours of executing the transaction(s). Furthermore, Rook Labs must present that the investment was approved by the CEO and CTO.\nPotential Applications:\n\nThere are numerous reasons that having a discretionary investment limit could be highly accretive for the DAO and allow us to maximize our investment performance over the near and long term. The following items below represent the most likely applications of this limit:\n\n* Merger and Acquisitions: In most, if not all, M&A transactions there is often a high level of confidentiality that must be maintained by both sides in order to ensure that the due diligence and negotiation process is fair and effective. If the other party in a M&A opportunity knows that Rook DAO cannot maintain a high level of confidentiality, we may be excluded from certain opportunities. Even if we are not excluded on the front end from these opportunities, our ability to execute upon them may be limited due to external forces frontrunning our investment or creating a bidding war. It is therefore imperative that we signal to other interested parties that we have the ability to have discussions without these risks.\n\n* Securing Optimal Investment Prices: Because governance is transparent and relatively slow moving, both internal and external parties have the benefit of knowing the DAO’s intentions before actions can be taken. This creates a situation where the DAO can get front run on potential investment opportunities or lose out on the opportunities all together. By allowing the DAO to take advantage of these opportunities without signalling our intent to the rest of the ecosystem, we can capture value in a nimble way while optimizing our investment basis.\n\n* Black Swan Rebalancing: In the event of unexpected major black-swan events, the DAO’s treasury must have the ability to be nimble in rebalancing its holdings to protect from significant declines. By having the ability to reposition our assets into more stable or liquid assets, we can not only protect the value that we have created, but also take advantage of lower market prices when there may be a better buying opportunity.\n\n## Recourse\n\nIn the event that the community comes to consensus that a discretionary investment made was inappropriate, they could take any of the following actions:\n\n* Unwind the action through a formal KIP\n* Ability to call an “all hands on deck” community call with Rook Labs team and individuals involved in the investment decision to discuss next steps.\n* Remove applicable team members from their positions\n\n## Specification\n\nEmpower Rook Labs to be able to make investments up to the lesser of $5M or 5% of the treasury’s notional value every 360 days.",

In parallel to this, Rook DAO Treasury was also brought into the discussion as mStable has a high-yielding savings account product that is relevant for Treasury utilization.\n\nBoth teams agreed that diversification of Rook's treasury into this product could be a part of a broader scheme of close collaboration between the mStable and Rook DAOs.\n\n## Stablecoins and DAOs\n\nWe’re in the early days of DAO treasury management, driven by the fact that DAO treasuries have grown enormously in very little time, while tooling available to them remains fragmented, suboptimal and incomplete\n\nWithin this framework, we think it is sensible to expand the use of stablecoins within DAO treasuries. Stablecoins realize the value accrued within the treasury, secure the protocol OPEX and offer long-run stability against market cycles. Beyond that, they give the opportunity to create sources of non-operating income while enabling opportunistic investment behaviours that create value for the DAO (e.g. buying the dip, token buybacks, etc.).\n\n## mStable and Stablecoin Utilization\n\nMaking stablecoins an integral part of a DAO’s diversification strategy will enable a path towards the DAO’s long-run sustainability, but it requires adequate tooling.\n\nmStable is a decentralized stablecoin ecosystem producing sustainable yield on USD. The protocol has been operating for 22 months without interruption or hacks and is one of the safest projects in DeFi for stablecoins. mStable scored 93% on DefiSafety review as of March 17, 2022 [link](https://www.defisafety.com/pqrs?title=mstable). The project is backed by Three Arrows Capital, DACM, DeFiance Capital & Alameda Research among others.\n\nAs of the time of this proposal, Save APY was historically around 15%, significantly outperforming competition (Yearn, Aave or Curve). Please check this link for more granular and up to date historic performance details (Dune dashboard [here](https://dune.com/naddison/mStable-imUSD-returns)).\n\n## About Save strategy\n\nmStable deposits 98% of mUSD’s underlying assets to established lending markets to earn a base interest rate. This rate is then further increased by distributing mStable Swap fees and liquidating external protocol incentives.\n\nmUSD exposition is:\n\n* 51% to Aave\n* 49% to Compound\n\nAs of the time of this proposal, the Save APY can be broken down as follows: 55% of it is coming from lending interest revenues on Aave & Compound, 22.5% from our AMM swap fees & the remaining 22.5% from platform rewards liquidation. It would mean that 22.5% of Save yield is independent of lending protocol and their inherent risk.\n\n## Rook DAO opportunity with mStable\n\nmStable Save is a stablecoin-agnostic savings platform for DAOs. Looking closely at Rook's treasury, we think such a utilization move could make sense. Considering the existing healthy structure of the treasury given its significant holdings of stablecoins, and the re-collateralization backstop protecting the $ROOK token, the protocol could explore moving a significant part of its available stablecoins\n\n## Rationale & Scenario analysis\n\nAccording to an October blog [post](https://blog.rook.fi/financial-update-october-2021/), Rook DAO's yearly burn rate was $740,499, which would take a $4.93m allocation at a 15% APY to cover it fully. Rook DAO could thus consider allocating between 50% and 80% of its unused USD holdings to cover (partially or fully) the DAO yearly expenses\n\nTo get started, we recommend that Rook's treasury deposit funds in tranches of $500,000 on a quarterly basis for a period of the community’s choosing. Using current data as of February 2022, this would result in an estimated annual yield of $210,595 if done for a full year. This would be an 11% marginal rate (Save proceeds are automatically compounded).\n\n## Benefits\n\nWith the aforementioned amount deposited into Save, Rook DAO could pay with mStable Save APY earnings a significant portfolio of its yearly capital requirement.\n\nMore generally, benefits would be:\n\n* Passive management of treasury\n* Consistently strong APY\n* Long-term protocol value growth\n* Trustless contract\n* Non-operating revenue stream\n* Seamless treasury management\n\n## Specification\n\nRook's treasury to deposit funds in tranches of $500,000 on a quarterly basis for a period of the community's choosing.",

See below our various monthly blog posts on TWAMM:\n\n- [November 2021: infrastructure & testing exploration](https://mirror.xyz/0x70626a.eth/0uIph6x5knS_QRfG2mluFb-83P9NF1w01JQ-GNjCgVY)\n- [Decemer 2021: sales rate research & simple arbitrage bots](https://mirror.xyz/0x70626a.eth/SIpA5Z4M6VYqCfvSKpTpRFw6bftE2ghi7fc7TA4c3LE)\n- [January 2022: end-to-end TWAMM simulator featuring historical market data and transactions, arbitrage bots, simulated long-term swaps](https://mirror.xyz/0x70626a.eth/SzxME01JrrVRmu_H9q_07kZCBLzzHyxV_fmp1WmZvWo)\n- [February 2022: gas optimization & TWAMM failure mode research](https://mirror.xyz/0x70626a.eth/yOP-PpK8pWE15SQ_Lte2srD_3lbqx89D5xFKfaVic8Y)\n- [February 2022: in depth parameter and gas cost research](https://mirror.xyz/0slippage.eth/5zKJW4Zx9zYHpB4jNln16HuU8d8EtawmA17usNfIje4)\n\n### About TWAMM\n\nWe’re building a new type of AMM purpose-built for time-insensitive trades that happen over multiple blocks. These trades can range from very large — think OTC trades for DAOs, Funds, whales, to small trades for retail (dollar-cost averaging).\n\nAs this is new and unexplored territory, there will be a heavy emphasis on research and development like optimal AMM designs, fee structures, gas optimizations, attack vectors, testing, and simulations. \n\n### Arbitrage and TWAMM\n\n*TLDR; Prove TWAMM with KeeperDAO (MEV share + “right to first arbitrage”) is more profitable for LPs than Uniswap V2 fee structure.*\n\nArbitrageurs play a very important role to ensure the proper functionality of TWAMM and keeping the asset prices in the liquidity pools in line with the wider market. Unlike traditional AMMs, when there’s an active long-term swap, the cost to interact with the underlying AMM increases every block. See the section under inactivity in our last blog post for more information: [https://mirror.xyz/0slippage.eth/5zKJW4Zx9zYHpB4jNln16HuU8d8EtawmA17usNfIje4](https://mirror.xyz/0slippage.eth/5zKJW4Zx9zYHpB4jNln16HuU8d8EtawmA17usNfIje4)\n\nWhen there are frequent arbitrages happening, traders get lower slippage and a significantly better return than trading on DEX aggregators for large swaps. Here’s how a pseudo-TWAMM performed vs 1Inch: [https://twitter.com/0xdramaone/status/1490397794452054018](https://twitter.com/0xdramaone/status/1490397794452054018). The arbitrage powered trade netted $5.4M vs $3.5M quoted by 1Inch, a +54% improvement!\n\nSimilar to Uniswap V2, we could build TWAMM with a flat fee and allow arbitrageurs in the free market to correct the prices and extract all the MEV. However, we’ve seen how that has adversely affected LPs in the long run — see [https://explore.flashbots.net/](https://explore.flashbots.net/). Uniswap V2 is the largest MEV leaker accounting for 64% of MEV extracting arbitrage trades, something that could have been avoided: [https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1504543109396504577](https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1504543109396504577)\n\nTWAMM’s underlying AMM will allow LPs to passively deposit tokens similar to Uniswap V2 across the entire range from 0 → infinity. Additionally, we expect almost the entirety of the trade traffic on the underlying AMM to be from arbitrageurs. Therefore, we are interested in researching the advantages a system like KeeperDAO provides in order to add MEV protection for passive LPs: [https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1504524010717077504](https://twitter.com/hasufl/status/1504524010717077504)\n\n### About the research\n\nThis grant will focus on the delivery of methods for efficient arbitrage of TWAMM contracts, in collaboration with developers at KeeperDAO. Though focused on TWAMM, we expect that any findings will generalize to other types of AMM.\n\nResearch topics will include:\n\n- Simulation and experimental measurement of arbitrage rates under different network conditions, fee regimes, liquidity conditions, and coordination scenarios.\n- Investigation of static and dynamic liquidity fees and their impact on arbitrage rates TWAMM performance.\n- Design considerations of integrating arbitrageurs with TWAMM, taking into account factors such as smart contract design, performance, trustlessness, security, and gas efficiency.\n\n### About the grant\n\nThe grant is structured as a 3-month research and development investment, in the form of:\n\n1. 200,000 USDC, streaming\n2. 200 ROOK, on successful completion\n\nThese amounts are derived from the KeeperDAO Contributor Incentive Guidelines. We computed three months total compensation for two L4 engineers, then discounted it by 20%. We believe this is a fair balance between recognizing that we will not be full-time contributors for KeeperDAO, but that we will be building in concert with KeeperDAO engineers, and ultimately contributing potentially large amounts of value.\n\nReceiving the majority of the value in stable coins will help us plan and cover living expenses and other operational costs more easily so that we can dedicate our full time to the development of TWAMM. It will also reduce the need to liquidate ROOK to cover those costs.\n\nHowever because we also value long-term incentive alignment, we include a 200 ROOK completion bonus.\n\n## Specification\n\n\n1. 200,000 USDC and 200 ROOK from the DAO Treasury shall be set aside to fund the research and development of the TWAMM project.\n    - 200,000 USDC from (1) shall be deposited into a Sablier stream ending June 28, 2022, claimable by an address controlled by the TWAMM project.\n    - 200 ROOK from (1) shall be transferred to an address controlled by the TWAMM project on successful completion of the grant goals.\n2. Research progress will be continually monitored by developers and a grant project manager from KeeperDAO to ensure adequate progress.\n3. The grant project manager from KeeperDAO may terminate the grant at their discretion. Any unpaid funds at the time of termination shall be returned to the DAO Treasury.\n",

Gamma’s products allow depositors to stabilize or enhance returns on concentrated liquidity AMMs like Uniswap v3 and the upcoming Sushi Trident and CrocSwap, without the need to manage the position themselves.\n\nA perpetual concern for such products is the potential for MEV when a position is being updated, as well as the negative impact of just-in-time (JIT) liquidity operations from sophisticated participants which can alter market structure to the detriment of the automated strategy.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, Gamma is partnering with KeeperDAO to integrate with the KeeperDAO Coordination protocol, which will offer LPs unprecedented access to our world-class execution network.\n\nBy coordinating position updates with our network of keepers, Gamma’s products will not just mitigate MEV, but capture it and use it to drive enhanced returns. Moreover, LPs will gain exposure to the most advanced JIT liquidity strategies, powered by the very keepers who had been competing against them in the liquidity pool! \n\n## Background\n\n### Concentrated liquidity and active position management\n\nAutomated market makers (AMMs) with support for concentrated liquidity allow liquidity providers (LPs) to specify a price range in which their liquidity becomes available to traders, rather than allowing it to be available across the entire pricing curve.\n\nA sophisticated LP will seek to increase returns by actively managing their position, i.e. dynamically altering the ranges where their liquidity is provided, in order to minimize adverse selection and maximize fees accrued.\n\n### Hypervisors\n\nGamma Strategies provides a smart contract called a “Hypervisor” that makes active position management strategies more accessible to regular LPs. Rather than provide liquidity to the AMM directly, depositors provide it to a Hypervisor contract, which then creates and manages a position on the target AMM using the deposited funds.\n\n- Hypervisor smart contract source code: [https://github.com/GammaStrategies/hypervisor/blob/519117704a67659273b78658ad43bcad8a8073ce/contracts/Hypervisor.sol](https://github.com/GammaStrategies/hypervisor/blob/519117704a67659273b78658ad43bcad8a8073ce/contracts/Hypervisor.sol)\n- More information about Hypervisors: [https://docs.gammastrategies.org/gamma/features/hypervisor](https://docs.gammastrategies.org/gamma/features/hypervisor)\n\n### How the Hypervisor works\n\nA Hypervisor maintains a position consisting of two UniswapV3Pool positions:\n\n1. A base position*,* which must match the pool's current ratio of token0 and token1 in composition.\n2. A limit position, which contains a single asset (often what cannot be deposited in the base position due to the mechanics of concentrated liquidity).\n\nAn advisor is an account designated by the deployer of the Hypervisor contract. The advisor alone has the right to call functions that modify the Hypervisor’s position. These functions are:\n\n- `rebalance` rebalance the position\n- `addBaseLiquidity` deploy assets to the base position without rebalancing\n- `addLimitLiquidity` deploy assets to the limit position without rebalancing\n- `pullLiquidity` remove liquidity from the Uniswap v3 pool\n\nThe most important and frequently-called of all the position update functions is `rebalance`. During a `rebalance` call:\n\n1. Liquidity is removed from the base position & limit position.\n2. Accrued fees are collected.\n3. 10% of the assets are transferred to the Gamma *Swap* contract.\n4. The removed liquidity, 90% of the fees, and assets in the Hypervisor, are then placed in a new base position and limit position.\n5. (Optionally) perform a swap of assets, by using the `swapQuantity` parameter of the `rebalance` function.\n\n### The impact of MEV on LP returns\n\nDepending on the liquidity of the pool, the size of the position, and the balance of the assets in the Hypervisor, rebalancing can create a meaningful amount of MEV. \n\nIt is important for the Hypervisor to mitigate front-running or sandwiching of rebalance transactions due to the negative impact on LP returns and the risk to LP capital that they pose. To accomplish mitigation Hypervisors today broadcast rebalance transactions via Flashbots RPC, and this has been effective at preventing this MEV leakage. \n\nBackrunning remains a possibility. It is not uncommon for a backrunning transaction to appear at the top of the block following the Flashbots block in which a rebalance occurs. \n\nExample: \n\n- Rebalance transaction [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe64caff620f1aeb818743a63c5fcd787dd6612c3b31fdf314ce0d9523bc0ffb5](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xe64caff620f1aeb818743a63c5fcd787dd6612c3b31fdf314ce0d9523bc0ffb5)\n- Rebalance backrun [https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa5b02ec1e1810e00f514dec7a58c15f36d446ebae7b6dd4b04aa44fe9712fef6](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa5b02ec1e1810e00f514dec7a58c15f36d446ebae7b6dd4b04aa44fe9712fef6)\n\nWhile this backrunning does not negatively impact LP returns, it does represent value that is directly attributable to the rebalance, which could be internalized to increase those returns.\n\n## Specification\n\n### A Coordination Facility for Hypervisors\n\nGamma Strategies and KeeperDAO will work together to create an advanced Hypervisor for which all position management transactions, including rebalances, are routed through the KeeperDAO Coordination Game and executed by Keepers acting through the Coordination protocol.\n\nWe expect that the addition of Coordination will allow LP returns to be enhanced through a combination of new efficiencies and strategies, including:\n\n- **Internalized backrun arbitrage**: Hypervisor LPs can now receive approximately 80% of the value of any backrun arbitrage executed as the result of a rebalance.\n- **New pool arbitrage**: Hypervisor LPs can now receive 80% of the value of any pool initialization arbitrage that becomes available when the Hypervisor is the initial deployment of liquidity to a Uniswap v3 pool.\n- **Just-in-time (”JIT”) liquidity**: Hypervisor LPs can now be included in just-in-time (JIT) liquidity strategies by specialized Keepers acting through the Coordination protocol. LPs can expect greater returns from a combination of fee concentration and reduced IL. Such JIT liquidity would be available for both Hiding Book orders and Uniswap v3 simultaneously.\n\n### Service requirements\n\nGamma Strategies has a number of requirements that must be met as service conditions for the arrangement.\n\nAll will be accomplished through the use of policies governing the behavior of Keepers. Additional backstop mechanisms will be discussed as the technical collaboration advances.\n\n1. Avoidance of any situation which results in loss to TVL of our Hypervisor positions as defined by value of underlying assets in position.\n2. All arbitrage opportunities would occur after a `rebalance` transaction.\n3. Directed manipulation of the Uniswap v3 price oracle must be avoided.\n    1. Example: Price manipulation that leads to liquidity being all in one asset, which can lead to a user depositing into our Hypervisor with a single asset and then withdrawing a disproportionate amount.\n    2. Example: Manipulating the Uniswap v3 price oracle to inflate the value of one’s collateral to drain a lending pool.\n\n",

On GMX, dynamic pricing is supported by (1) Chainlink Oracles (https://chain.link), which source price updates from a number of venues, and (2) TWAP pricing from DEXes with high traded volume in the asset.\n\nBecause price updates occur per-block, significant changes in the price between updates can create opportunities for arbitrage when the update occurs. The value of this arbitrage, along with related opportunities such as liquidation resulting from the same phenomenon, has been termed Oracle Extractable Value, or OEV.\n\n### GMX and KeeperDAO\n\nGMX will use KeeperDAO’s Coordination protocol to relay oracle updates and internalize OEV/MEV for the protocol and its liquidity pool, which will enhance returns for liquidity providers while preventing negative externalities.\n\nKeeperDAO keepers will source liquidity and conduct atomic backrun arbitrage to ensure that the vast majority of the OEV in each price update is being captured and retained by GMX. All operations are completely transparent and verifiable on-chain, allowing GMX to validate that the service arrangement is sound at all times. The Coordination protocol’s unique design allows KeeperDAO keepers to execute these transactions without contention, further enhancing profitability for GMX.\n\nThe two teams will continue to research improvements in design and delivery of fast price oracle updates that allow OEV/MEV to be internalized while eliminating negative effects for the settlement network at the same time.\n\nThe integration has been designed to fall back to the *status quo* in the event of failure, so that GMX is not service-dependent on KeeperDAO in any way.\n\n### Arbitrum and Avalanche\n\nThis integration will represent the first application of the KeeperDAO Coordination protocol on both an Ethereum Layer-2 (Arbitrum), and a non-Ethereum blockchain (Avalanche).\n\nThis should underscore the fact that the Coordination protocol has been designed from the start to operate in a blockchain- and layer-agnostic way, allowing discovery and settlement to occur in many different places at once, all interacting through the same protocol.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. All GMX oracle updates on Arbitrum and Avalanche will be relayed through the KeeperDAO Coordination protocol.\n2. The Coordination protocol will discover OEV and (when profitable) settle the price update and any associated arbitrage for the best available profit.\n3. The GMX protocol will receive 80% of the discovered per-transaction OEV.\n4. No hard service dependency will be created between GMX and KeeperDAO.\n\n",

Given this, it no longer makes sense for us to dedicate resources to its maintenance as more is gained from sunsetting the product and reallocating the deposited funds to more directly align with KeeperDAO's long-term vision.\n\nAs it stands, we have ~48 million dollars worth of assets deposited to the liquidity pools. A summary is given below.\n\nAsset | Amount | Today's Value\n----- | ------ | -------------\nkETH  | 4,615.85 | $12,532,032.75\nkwETH | 4,604.02 | $12,499,914.30\nkDAI | 12,741,904.44 | $12,741,904.44\nkBTC | 134.803 | $5,648,245.70\nkUSDC | 4,369,935.23 | $4,369,935.23\nTotal |           | $47,792,032.42\n\nAccording to the core team, the amount of liquidity required for flash loans is approximately $5M of each asset. As this is already covered by existing DAO Treasury deposits, we propose to cease ROOK emissions for liquidity providers, and allow excess DAO Treasury funds deposited in the pools to be withdrawn, while leaving at least the required amount of assets in each pool to provide effective flash loan liquidity. When the trading protocol upgrade is live, the entirety of deposited DAO Treasury funds can be withdrawn, and we may declare the liquidity pools obsolete.\n\n## Specification \n1. Mint an amount of ROOK to cover LP emissions for the period between the end of Act V and the block in which this KIP is ratified.\n2. Notify all LP users of a scheduled phase-out of the LP.\n3. Emit no further ROOK to LPs after the emissions minted in (1) are exhausted.\n4. Maintain, for 1 year, a UI that will allow users to withdraw their capital from the Liquidity Pools. After that, provide instructions for users to call the LP smart contracts directly.\n5. Make a best effort to maintain in the pools only sufficient liquidity to cover flash loan needs (estimated to be approximately $5M worth of assets in each pool at present) until the pools become obsolete.\n\n",

But when considered as a whole, it no longer makes sense for us to dedicate resources to its development and maintenance.\n\n- The intention behind the Hiding Vaults was to give our Keepers access to MEV opportunities from liquidations and generate revenue for the treasury from it. But we’ve since realized that by focusing on a B2B (or perhaps better: DAO-to-protocol) strategy - such as the recently announced partnership with B. Protocol - we’re able to give our Keepers access to these MEV opportunities much more efficiently, with minimal capital requirements or need for additional automation.\n- The things our team has the deepest expertise in, the best growth case for, and can be the best in the world at, are arbitrage, order execution, and coordination. By not focusing on them exclusively, we are losing ground and eroding these competitive advantages.\n- Because the Hiding Vault is such a different product from our core focus, it splits the focus of several of our teams - e.g. Engineering, Product and Marketing - and as such is a detriment to us functioning most efficiently towards fulfilling the DAOs purpose. Great startups often do one thing well. It’s time for us to become singularly focused one that one thing again.\n- There is no product-market fit: The amount of total and regular users are low, and less than 10 new vaults have been minted in the last 60 days. Our Vaults TVL has been consistently shrinking, with withdrawals from the vault outpacing new loans.\n- The Hiding Vault, as a completely separate product from trading, makes defining what KeeperDAO does much more confusing.\n- The opportunity cost is high: should we continue to focus on something that *could* make the DAO money in the future, while we could be working on something that *already* makes us money today and has a much higher TAM? Liquidation profits only account for about 5% of all MEV, to focus on it at the expense of arbitrage or other opportunities would be a disservice to tokenholders.\n- The Hiding Vaults’ economics are driven by inflationary ROOK rewards and as such is a hindrance to our near-term goal of making ROOK deflationary through Coordinomics.\n- The economics behind the Hiding Vault aren’t working. To put it bluntly, we are basically paying customers to use a service that stops us from making money.\n\nInnovation means dealing with uncertainty. You’re trying to build something no one has build before. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn’t. And when it doesn’t, it’s best to cut your losses quickly and move on. This is the natural process of entrepreneurship. In our case, this means sunsetting the Hiding Vaults and making sure our entire team is once again singularly focused on building the Coordination Protocol of DeFi.\n\nAs a first step in this process, this KIP proposes to immediately end the Hiding Vault emissions. This will stop giving away 282.975 ROOK per week. Ending rewards and notifying users that the product will be deprecated is the first step in a scheduled phase-out of Hiding Vaults. We will, just as we have with legacy LPs, keep a minimal interface running to all users to repay loans, and withdraw funds from the vaults.\n\n## Specification\n1. Mint exactly enough ROOK to cover the period between the end of Act V and the block that this KIP is ratified on (if it is ratified).\n2. Stop ROOK emissions to Hiding Vault users after the block that this KIP is ratified on (if it is ratified).\n3. Notify all Hiding Vault users of a scheduled phase-out of the Hiding Vault functionality.\n4. Shut down the bot handling Hiding Vault liquidations. Any remaining Hiding Vault positions will still function, but liquidations will be handled by external keepers in the wild.\n5. Maintain, for a reasonable amount of time, a UI that will allow users to withdraw their capital from the Hiding Vaults. After that, provide instructions for users to call the Hiding Vault smart contracts directly (Warning: this will be complex).\n",

The current signers of the KeeperDAO Labs multisig are @WhatsTheDeetz, @Pai-Sho, and @JZ.\n\nThe breakdown of the ROOK budget is given below, with more detail provided in subsections.\n\n| Team | Total (ROOK) |\n| ---- | ------------ |\n| Product and Engineering | 1040 |\n| Growth and Operations | 720 |\n| People Operations | 500 |\n| Grants | 150 |\n| Treasury | 180 |\n| Studio | 240 |\n| Marketing and Brand | 600 |\n| Grand Total | 3430 |\n\n\n### Product and Engineering: 1040 ROOK\n\nWe use ROOK grants for all part-time engineering roles. Currently, we have 3 engineering contractors who are paid weekly at 10 ROOK/week. We estimate that we have management capacity for 5 - 8 engineering contractors. This budget allows for the maximum (8).\n\n| IC Description | Per Week (ROOK) | Total (ROOK) |\n| -------------- | -------- | ----- |\n| Product engineer | 10 | 120 |\n| Product engineer | 10 | 120 |\n| Product engineer | 10 | 120 |\n| Product engineer | 10 | 120 |\n| Product engineer | 10 | 120 |\n| Webflow | 10 | 200 |\n| Designer | 10 | 120 |\n| Backend engineer | 10 | 120 |\n\n### Growth and Operations: 720 ROOK\n\nWe intend to use ROOK grants for part-time roles in business development, customer service, DAO engagement, and governance. Additionally, we intend to use ROOK grants for those wishing to start on the path to a full-time role.\n\n| Description | Per Week (ROOK) | Total (ROOK) |\n| ----------- | -------- | ----- |\n| Business development | 20 | 240 |\n| Operations | 40 | 480 |\n\n### People Operations: 500 ROOK\n\nWe intend to use ROOK grants for part-time roles including technical recruiters and process coordinators, in addition to bridging part-time contribution to full-time contribution. In addition, we expect this ROOK budget may be required for other recruiting expenses, including placement fees of up to 25% of the first year salary of a new hire (for certain recruiting firms).\n\n| Description | Per Week (ROOK) | Total (ROOK) |\n| ----------- | -------- | ----- |\n| Workplace |   --    | 500 |\n\n\n### Community Grants: 150 ROOK\n\nWe intend to use ROOK grants to fund small projects that foster community growth, accelerate development, discover and support partners, translations, or other ad hoc projects.\n\n| Description | Per Week (ROOK) | Total (ROOK) |\n| ----------- | -------- | ----- |\n| Community grants |   --    | 150 |\n\n### Treasury: 180 ROOK\n\nWe intend to use ROOK grants for part-time roles or for bridging part-time to full-time work, in support of the treasury functions of the DAO.\n\n| Description | Per Week (ROOK) | Total (ROOK) |\n| ----------- | -------- | ----- |\n| Treasury analyst |   10    | 120 |\n| Treasury analyst |   5    | 60 |\n\n\n### Studio: 240 ROOK\n\nWe intend to use ROOK grants for part-time roles or for bridging part-time to full-time work, on a studio team that can fuel high-quality, in-house content generation. This content will help to consistently communicate our brand, mission, and values, as well as cementing our partnerships and mythos. We’ll be seeking to onboard for design and production roles to flesh out our creative skillsets, and commission projects in the interim.\n\n| Description | Per Week (ROOK) | Total (ROOK) |\n| ----------- | -------- | ----- |\n| Video producer |   10    | 120 |\n| UX designer |   10    | 120 |\n\n\n### Marketing and Branding: 600 ROOK\n\nWe intend to use ROOK grants for part-time roles or for briding part-time to full-time work supporting a marketing function. Additional ROOK budget is required for various advertising and sponsorship needs that will ramp up our marketing efforts ahead of the launch of the Coordination Game.\n\n| Description | Per Week (ROOK) | Total (ROOK) |\n| ----------- | -------- | ----- |\n| Research |   --    | 100 |\n| UX designer |   --    | 500 |\n\n\n### USDC Needs: 500,000\n\nOver the budget period, we forsee the need to spend USDC on placement fees, contractors and vendors who do not take ROOK, conferences, and advertisements.\n\n| Description  | Total (USDC) |\n| ----------- | ----- |\n| Contractors and recruiting | 462,500.00 |\n| Events |  5000.00 |\n| Conferences | 8000.00 |\n| Team reimbursements | 25,000.00 |\n| Total | 500,500.00 |\n\n### ETH Needs: 1\n\nWe intend to use 1 ETH for network fees incurred during the transfer of grants over the budget period.\n\n| Description  | Total (ETH) |\n| ----------- | ----- |\n| Gas | 1 |\n\n### Excess ROOK and USDC Rollover\n\nThe budget above represents in all cases an upper bound. It isn't required that we spend all of it, and we do not seek to. If excess ROOK or USDC exists at the end of the budget period, it will carry over into the subsequent budget period unless superceded by another KIP.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Transfer 3430 ROOK, 500,500 USDC and 1 ETH (for gas) from the KeeperDAO Treasury (0x9a67F1940164d0318612b497E8e6038f902a00a4) to the KeeperDAO Labs multi-sig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006).\n2. As appropriate, provide funding from the KeeperDAO Labs multi-sig (0xa8b0a855BE21568B93f32805b244158Cc61AD006) to meet the needs outlined above during the budget period.\n3. Ensure good recordkeeping to provide for review of any transactions by the DAO.\n",

[KeeperDAO Coordination Game Economics](https://docs.keeperdao.com/reference/developers/coordination-game/economics)\n5. [https://dune.xyz/dani/Liquity](https://dune.xyz/dani/Liquity)\n\n## Background\n\nThe B.Protocol B.AMM [2,3] is a novel automated market maker smart contract which allows backstop liquidity providers (”Backstoppers”) to earn fees during liquidations. Backstoppers provide liquidity (e.g. DAI), which normally sits idle and farms yield. When a loan becomes liquidatable, the protocol removes some idle funds (e.g. DAI) in order to purchase the distressed collateral (e.g. ETH), removing the risk from the lending protocol and restoring the health of the loan. \n\nThe system, which was balanced before, is now long ETH and short DAI, and needs to rebalance. The B.AMM facilitates rebalancing with a pricing curve derived from the Curve CFMM formula, which will offer traders on the B.AMM a discount that incentivizes them to arbitrage away the imbalance. Fees collected from swaps on the B.AMM go to the Backstoppers.\n\nFor a full report, see the B.Protocol B.AMM blog post [2] or B.AMM whitepaper [3].\n\n### KeeperDAO Coordination facility\n\nKeeperDAO and B.Protocol have worked together to research an improvement to the B.AMM which will increase the efficiency of small to medium-sized liquidations, adding value for both B.AMM LPs and the lending protocols which the B.AMM is used to backstop.\n\nThrough a modification of the B.AMM fees, KeeperDAO can extend the Coordination protocol to the B.AMM, creating a highly efficient environment that prevents MEV leakage and allows KeeperDAO keepers to perform rapid, continuous removal of small to medium-sized portfolio imbalances in the B.AMM. \n\nThe fee modification will allow KeeperDAO keepers to reach arbitrage price sooner, hiding MEV and allowing execution to take place through the Coordination protocol, where it can be fairly re-distributed. The improved rebalance efficiency that results will in turn improve yields for Backstoppers, since less of the collateral will be lost to the discount, ultimately helping the B.AMM in its goal of incentivizing a steady reserve of backstop liquidity. The vast majority (~80%) of the MEV captured by KeeperDAO will be redistributed back to the B.AMM through the Coordination Game Economic System [4]. This is Coordinomics in action — everybody wins.\n\n### KeeperDAO liquidity commitment\n\nFor every B.AMM that supports the Coordination protocol, KeeperDAO will commit seed liquidity to help the B.AMM reach immediate production readiness after deployment. This will allow integration partners to be assured of an adequate backstop and service level from the start, and have the added benefit of assuring our commitment to servicing the B.AMM.\n\nOnce a particular B.AMM is saturated with other LPs, KeeperDAO may withdraw the seed liquidity and make it available for a successive integration. Deposits in the B.AMM are yield-bearing, and are estimated to earn roughly 10% APY depending on the asset.\n\n### Transaction flow for KeeperDAO Keepers\n\nThe initial B.AMM to support the Coordination protocol is planned to be the B.AMM currently supporting Liquity’s LUSD token.\n\nThe B.AMM currently handles approximately 25% of all LUSD liquidations. LUSD liquidation activity can be viewed using the Liquity Dune Analytics dashboard [5].\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Earmark $5,000,000 of stablecoins from the KeeperDAO Treasury for use as seed liquidity for new B.AMM deployments that support the Hiding Game.\n2. Stand ready to deposit this liquidity in successive target B.AMM contracts after security review, auditing, and deployment is complete, as long as other capital requirements have been met.\n3. Return this liquidity along with any yields accrued during its use, to the KeeperDAO Treasury on completion of the program, as determined by the relevant contributors.\n\n",

Utilizing these assets is preferred to leveraging our stablecoins as it reduces the amount of directional asset risk that the DAO assumes. \n\n### Potential Strategic Uses\n\n* Expand, retain, and incentivize contributors that are vital to the future development of new products and infrastructure for KD\n* Allow for additional strategic partnerships, M&A activity, or other strategic token swaps\n* Allow for future fundraising initiatives\n\n### Benefits\n\n* Expands the balance of ROOK that can be deployed through governance to potential support future growth/retention in contributors and other strategic initiatives\n* Signals a level of confidence in the soundness and liquidity of the DAO’s treasury\n* Reduces the amount of ROOK circulating in the open market\n* Raises awareness of the ROOK token\n\n### Risks\n\n* Increases the percentage of a native asset which at times is less liquid\n* Reduces near-term options to acquire other assets that may better diversify KD’s portfolio or provide a higher rate of return.\n\n\n## Specification\n\nPrior to the launch of the CG, a maximum of $4,000,000 of DAO Treasury ETH and/or BTC may be used to acquire ROOK from the open market at the discretion of the treasury multisig signers, with the potential to delegate all or part of the execution to an individual from among the signers. The acquired ROOK will be deposited in the DAO Treasury. Upon completion, an update will be announced on Discord and Twitter with the full transaction details.\n",

Community members now constitute the vast majority (85%) of full-time contributors, up from 0% in June 2021.\n\nContributors have self-organized to tackle important tasks that in many other DAOs would be the responsibility of a \"Core Team\", including:\n\n- Designing and implementing a new KeeperDAO app.\n- Creating a new brand image and visual design.\n- Creating new websites, documentation, and marketing materials.\n- Establishing regular community calls and townhalls with featured guests\n- Launching the [KeeperDAO governance](https://blog.keeperdao.com/introducing-keeperdao-governance/) system.\n- Founding [KeeperDAO Labs](https://blog.keeperdao.com/labs/) and administering a grants program for new contributors.\n- Active development on Ninja, the Coordination Game, Hiding Book, and Hiding Vaults.\n- Conducting business development, partner, and DAO-to-DAO discussions.\n- Managing DAO treasury positions and yield-generating opportunities.\n\nThis is a great accomplishment for our community and founding team. This period of bootstrapping has shown us what a DAO can do, and we want to build on that in order to accelerate into the next phase of KeeperDAO's growth.\n\n### The next 3 months: setting up for expansion\n\nThis KIP is the catalyst for a broad transformation to take place over the next 3 months, from January-March 2022. During this time we will collectively incubate the new KeeperDAO, by making investments in talent, education, and organization, in order to emerge as a new DeFi powerhouse.\n\nRather than attempt to create a perfect structure in advance, wasting precious time and initiative, this proposal suggests to temporarily empower key players jz and hazard to begin the process of transformation, and accomplish the remaining major steps gradually during the next quarter, with the entire process overseen and shaped by Sophons and members of the community.\n\nThe appointments of jz and hazard were proposed (by unanimous consent) of the contributors from both the core and labs teams in [Proposing a KeeperDAO Leadership Team](https://keeperdao-labs.notion.site/Proposing-our-Leadership-Team-e4de957ca0514f26a17dff372b65781e).\n\nThe draft organizational plan, i.e. what we are today aiming for as an end-state of the transformation, but which is subject to change, may be summarized as:\n\n1. A DAO charter or constitution\n2. An executive coordination team of CEO and CTO\n3. An oversight team of Sophons, aided by the DAO at large\n4. Transparent compensation and contributor guidelines\n5. Transparent budgeting and funding process\n6. Transparent objectives and performance review process\n7. A set of delegated powers\n8. A set of coordinating teams, each with:\n      - Mission\n      - Facilitator(s)\n      - Measurable objective(s)\n      - Budget\n\nMore details can be found in [The New Citadel: A Vision for KeeperDAO](https://www.notion.so/The-New-Citadel-A-Vision-for-KeeperDAO-7c436bae5da141fba917e8a7ce6542a8).\n\n## Specification\n\n1. This proposal creates the office of CEO and CTO\n2. This proposal appoints @hazard as CEO and @j_z as CTO\n3. This proposal grants the CEO and CTO operational authority to:\n    1. Identify and engage key contributors.\n    2. Determine and distribute DAO Treasury funds needed for interim compensation (pending ratification of a complete budget).\n    3. Set priorities and encourage team formation in areas of strategic importance.\n    4. Facilitate business development and integrations\n4. This proposal grants Sophons operational authority to review and challenge any and all actions of the CEO and CTO\n5. This proposal requires the CEO and CTO to work with stakeholders to develop a unified organizational framework which will allow KeeperDAO to scale while maintaining community governance, participation, and ownership.\n\nIf adopted, authorities granted will be in effect for three (3) months until the end of Q1 2022, i.e. March 31 at midnight UTC, unless superceded or extended by a subsequent KIP.",

It provides an infrastructure for protocols to use their own treasury funds to provide liquidity and generate yield. By providing liquidity on Uniswap v3 via Visor Finance, there will be deeper liquidity for the ROOK-ETH pair and an opportunity to generate higher yield on KeeperDAO’s protocol controlled assets.\n\n## Analysis\n\nThe capital efficiency of Uniswap v3 offers many advantages.  Given that much of the liquidity will be concentrated around the current price tick, there will be less slippage for same volume trades on the same amount of liquidity as on Sushiswap (or Uniswap v2).  For example, concentrating liquidity around +/-50% of the current price may have up to 4x the capital efficiency of Sushiswap and may require less than 25% of the liquidity as Sushiswap. Additionally, the lower liquidity threshold required on Uniswap v3 allows for KeeperDAO to provide the liquidity with its own treasury and diminishes the need to pay liquidity mining rewards for ROOK-ETH.\n\nManaging the price range on Uniswap v3 requires active management, which is provided by Visor Finance and its research organization Gamma Strategies.  As the price of ROOK varies, Visor Finance will ensure that the price stays within range and that there is sufficient liquidity to support ROOK-ETH trade volume.\n\nThe current liquidity for ROOK-ETH is segregated among various AMMs which is inefficiently routing trades when using a DEX aggregator like 1inch or paraswap. The current liquidity situation is as follows:\n\n* Bancor: BNT / ROOK liquidity of $11M\n* Sushi: ETH / ROOK liquidity of $4.4M\n* Uni v2: ETH / ROOK liquidity of $4.8M\n* Uni v3: ETH / ROOK liquidity of $1.0M\n\nCurrently, a 10 ETH trade for ROOK is being routed partially to Bancor, Sushi, and/or Uni v2 when using a DEX aggregator like 1inch because 1inch is routing trades in a way that gets the most favorable price impact based on slippage. The current slippage for a 10 ETH trade on each of the AMMs are as follows:\n\n* Bancor: 1.2%\n* Sushi: 2.1%\n* Uni v2: 1.4%\n* Uni v3: 0.8 - 3% (can vary depending on price action & placement of other liquidity)\n\nTherefore, in order to provide liquidity on Uni v3 to maximize profitability for KeeperDAO, the slippage should be lowered to 1.2% or below for a 10 ETH purchase.\n\nAccording to our analysis here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eCyNRl1jmk5f6Ndqk2V_BSVyCCO3hCTzUhgFYgy8K5Y/edit#gid=0, we believe $3M of total liquidity, placed in at least a +/- 40% range would be ideal for absorbing most of the trade volume from ETH to ROOK on Uni v3. Given the existing liquidity of $1M already in the Uni v3 pool, at least $2M should be provided by the KeeperDAO treasury to increase the likelihood of trades being routed to v3 and capturing the most volume & profitability.\n\n## Risks\n*Other liquidity:*  Currently, the majority (or over 80% of the liquidity) is currently being provided by a single address:  0xD6Cb7a7b544E24e5160A948a16C45b1096276F9d.  This could potentially leave KeeperDAO in a vulnerable position if all of that liquidity were to be removed by that single provider, and trades were continuously being routed through other venues.\n\n*Impermanent loss:*  Providing liquidity in a narrower price range can lead to earning higher fees, but can subject the liquidity provider to greater impermanent loss as prices of the underlying assets diverge.  Conversely, providing liquidity in a wider range will earn less fees than a narrower one, but are accordingly at lower risk of  suffering impermanent losses when there is price divergence.  \n\nGamma Strategies aims to reduce the risks of impermanent loss by widening the ranges during periods of high volatility and narrowing the ranges in periods of low volatility in order to maximize yields.\n\n## Process\nKeeperDAO will supply $1,000,000 USD of ROOK and $1,000,000 USD of ETH to the Visor position manager contract called the Hypervisor (https://github.com/VisorFinance/hypervisor/blob/master/contracts/Hypervisor.sol) , which will mint fungible ERC-20 LP tokens to a whitelisted address provided by KeeperDAO. \nOnly the whitelisted address provided by KeeperDAO will have the right to deposit / withdraw assets to and from the Hypervisor.  The position manager contract has the right to a few functions which are to set base ranges, set limit ranges, collect fees, rebalance, and mint/burn LP tokens to the whitelisted address.  Therefore, the Hypervisor contract has only management rights and is non-custodial in that only the provided whitelisted address may deposit / withdraw assets into and out of the contract.\n\nVisor Finance takes 10% of earned fees, which get distributed to VISR stakers.  90% of earned fees will be automatically re-invested into the LP position upon each rebalance.  Visor Finance will cover all gas fees for rebalancing positions and re-investing earned fees. \n\n\n## Specification\n1. Send $1,000,000 USD of ROOK and $1,000,000 USD of ETH to the ROOK-ETH Hypervisor to be managed on the ROOK-ETH pool on Uniswap v3\n2. Receive ERC-20 LP tokens in the whitelisted address provided by KeeperDAO\n",

This proposal is contingent on Bancor approving an their matching governance proposal to increase in the co-investment limit from 1.3M BNT to 2.1M BNT and approve LM rewards for the ROOK-BNT pool.\n\n## Background\nBancor, a long standing integration partner and home for staking ROOK, has offered to increase their co-investment in the ROOK-BNT pool on their platform. Currently, they have already invested 1.3M BNT into the pool, and are offering to add additional BNT to bring the total to 2.1M BNT. Bancor is leaving additional room in the pool for other ROOK holders to join the pool.\n\nThere is currently **~1.3M BNT** and **~22K ROOK** tokens in the BNT-ROOK [pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFa7b9AD60304119f59B172Ef78B98D50cb9A5c98). This has resulted in a pool that has roughly **~11.2M** in liquidity. \n![4f73653fb483cefb906f5e1561c80e13b871a457|482x295](upload://bkQX8KXjr80Ol9yjofmU5jXUaTd.png)\n\nThis is favorable because:\n\n* More liquidity in this pool should drive more volume through it, resulting in additional fees (APY) for current ROOK stakers.\n\n* This makes unproductive ROOK in the treasury generate yield.\n\n* Deepens a relationship with a good partner by creating a win-win.\n\n\n## Specification\nDeposit 6400 ROOK from strategic reserves into the ROOK-BNT pool on Bancor.",

      "content": "---\n\n**This is an apparent consensus vote.**\n\n* Vote 'No objection' if you agree with the proposal.\n* Vote 'Object' if you disagree with the proposal.\n\n**Join the Discussion**\n* [Github (link)](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-9/KIP-9.md)\n* [Forum discussion (link)](https://forum.keeperdao.com/t/kip-9-act-v-emissions-balance-effective-11-14/195)\n* [Discord (link)](https://discord.gg/jmr5QGt3MQ)\n\n---\n\n\n## Proposal\nUpdate emissions to reflect taper schedule and account for trading (Hiding Game) focus\n\n## Background\n\nUpon the passing of KIP-2 and KIP-4, we have seen a decrease in Hiding Vault emissions and an increase in demand for the ROOK token. For those unfamiliar, KeeperDAO emissions are generally set to decrease every Act by ~30%. At this current time, with KIP-2 having passed, we are already emitting 30% less than planned.\n\nAccordingly, I believe we should emit the same amount of ROOK as we do today (and was anticipated for Act V, before KIP-2). This is 404.25 ROOK per day. This is 38808 ROOK for the whole epoch (~96 days, depending on block speed).\n\n### KIP-2 Context\nThe key tenants of KIP-2, from @whatsthedeetz, were:\n\n* Hiding Vaults already receive significant benefits from Compound (interest and COMP distribution) and JITU (liquidity buffer). The ROOK rewards should be some (light) icing on the cake. \n\n* Hiding Vault rewards are not currently motivating users to take positions that create MEV. Until we are able to dynamically distribute rewards to different assets in an effort to dissuade same token supply and borrowing, the Hiding Vault will not be utilized to its full potential. \n\n### KIP-4 Context\nWith the passing of KIP-4, we also turn Hiding Game emissions into buy pressure with the beneath flywheel:\n\nEmission Value -> Volume -> Revenue -> Buy back -> Higher ROOK price -> Higher Emission Value\n\n### Buy Back (Continuation)\n\nWe would continue with buy backs until the release of the Coordination Game, as outlined in KIP-4.\n\nOverall, we will see about 30% more emissions (than today) go towards the Hiding Game, which we know correlates to volume.\n\n### Allocation\nAccordingly, I propose the following be default emissions for Act V:\n\n|Name|Percentage|# ROOK |# ROOK per day|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Hiding Game|70|27165.6|282.975|\n|Liquidity Pools|20|7761.6|80.85|\n|Hiding Vault|10|3880.8|40.425|\n|Total|100|38808|404.25|\n\nI propose these emissions be minted in 102528 block (~16 day) increments. This means every 102528 blocks, 6468 ROOK would be minted as outlined above. This will change with the release of the Coordination Game.\n\n### Key Blocks\n\n- **Act IV ends:** [Block 13617668](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/13617668)\n- **Second mint:** [Block 13720196](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/13720196)\n- **Third mint:** [Block 13822724](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/13822724)\n- **Fourth mint:**  [Block 13925252](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/13925252)\n- **Fifth mint:** [Block 14027780](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/14027780)\n- **Sixth (final) mint:** [Block 14130308](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/14130308)\n- **Act V ends:** [Block 14232836](https://etherscan.io/block/countdown/14232836)\n\n\n## Specification\n\n1. For the duration of Act V, every 102528 blocks we will emit 6468 ROOK for users of the protocol (consistent with planned emission rate before KIP-2).\n2. This ROOK will be distributed with a ratio of 70% to the Hiding Game, 20% to Liquidity Pools, and 10% to Hiding Vault borrowers.\n3. Continue KIP-4 Buy back and burns with 100% of net revenue\n",

This has been exacerbated by a lack of token liquidity.\n\n[Olympus Pro](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro/) offers an appealing resolution to this illiquidity.\n\n---\n\n## Analysis\n\nOlympus Pro bonds offer governance tokens at a discount in exchange for liquidity. Implementing ROOK bonds would provide a sustained source of protocol-owned liquidity for the treasury (ROOK:wETH Uniswap v2 tokens and Sushiswap).\n\nUltimately, owning productive liquidity with the treasury is a scalable, multi-beneficial adjustment.\n\n### Benefits\n\n• Permanent liquidity floor supports investors and minimizes down side risk\n• Token liquidity is an important factor many Price Oracles require\n• Minimizes Volatility\n• APY from trading fees\n• Additional DEX liquidity without having to commit treasury ETH reserves\n\n### Downsides & Risks\n\n• Discounted ROOK tokens open some surface area for arbitrage. The thesis is the bond period, with anticipated appreciation, would make it non-trivial to execute on the arbitrage. Bond vesting periods are configurable; the default is 7 days.\n\n### Why do this instead of putting up LP ourselves\n\n• Opportunity to distribute ROOK to a wider group of committed users\n• Discounted price for new ROOK buyers\n• Bond period briefly locks up ROOK\n• Relationship with a project with a strong community and potential for future synergies\n\n### Strategic Choice\n\n• We should not add additional emission sources by minting new ROOK tokens to commit to a bond program.\n\nInstead, we have a few choices. The most appealing option is to use Strategic Reserves ROOK. The founding team agrees this is an apt use for Strategic Reserves and would be happy to use 5,000 ROOK for this.\n\n### Olympus Pro Resources\n\n- [Olympus Pro Docs](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/pro/)\n- [Olympus Pro Announcement](https://olympusdao.medium.com/introducing-olympus-pro-d8db3052fca5)\n- [Olympus Pro Site](https://www.olympusdao.finance/pro)\n- [Olympus Pro Marketplace](https://pro.olympusdao.finance/)\n\n---\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Enter Olympus Pro's bond program with 5,000 ROOK (from Strategic Reserves) to last 15 weeks. This will yield us ROOK:wETH liquidity to support long term price stability and health on Uni v2 & Sushiswap.\n\n\n",

Their upcoming offerings related to Curve v2 (stable/BTC/ETH or ETH v2 Pools) offer a very enticing opportunity for ROOK to gain substantial liquidity, as these could form the basis of composite pools (e.g. ROOK/Tricrypto) in the same manner that the 3pool (USDC/USDT/DAI) forms the basis of composite pools with other stables (e.g. 3pool/MIM).\n\nOwning a substantial portion of voting weight within the protocol can not only drive profitable emissions to KeeperDAO but also allow us to earn additional revenue through bribes from other protocols seeking influence over the Curve protocol.\n\nConvex offers an optimization that would allow KeeperDAO to aggressively gain more significant influence over the Curve protocol. This is because each vote-locked CVX token currently controls more than 7 vote-locked CRV tokens.\n\nKeeperDAO has grown its treasury to over $100 million (non-ROOK NAV) - this would be a novel and profitable way to exercise its power.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n### Yield\n\n- Bribe yield (acceptance of bribes)\n- Inflationary yield (of CVX and CVXCRV)\n- High yield (With bribes ~44%)\n- Distribute bribes into the treasury\n\n### ROOK pool\n\n1. Create a Curve v2 Pool\n2. Vote to ensure the pool has a significant gauge that is eligible for CRV rewards using our CRV voting power\n3. Ensure an appropriate level of CRV emissions are directed to this gauge through voting power\n4. Now people want to LP ROOK in the well-incentivized pool\n\n### Inter-DAO coordination\n\n- Using our voting power to help fellow DAOs to unlock shared value\n\n## Implementation\n\nA maximum of $40,000,000 from the DAO treasury will be used to acquire a CVX position, using a combination of USDC, DAI, ETH, and wETH, with a target minimum of 1,000,000 and a target maximum of 2,000,000 CVX, or a maximum average price of $40 per CVX.\n\nThe precise execution strategy is left opaque to minimize the risk of market speculation, front-running, et cetera. Upon completion, an update will be announced on Discord and Twitter with the full transaction details.\n\nWhen roughly $25 million of CVX has been acquired, this will be communicated with the DAO and we will collectively decide if we would like to proceed. The same action will be taken, if and once the next benchmark of ~$32.5 million of CVX has been acquired.\n\n### Asset Usage\n\nThe acquired CVX will be vote locked with Convex Finance for vlCVX. vlCVX will yield CVXCRV. This CVXCRV will be swapped for more CVX, which will be locked for vlCVX.\n\nThis initial strategy is subject to change at the discretion of the KeeperDAO core team with community involvement.\n\nThis position comes with no predetermined time horizon, but there is a 16-week lockup upon vote locking.\n\nManagement of the position, including voting and token decisions, will be at the collaborative discretion of the KeeperDAO core team and the community, with execution being performed by the core team. This allows for agile response and risk management while leaving open the option for the future structure.\n\nBy default, bribe yield will be deposited to the KeeperDAO treasury but may be put to use if an applicable staking mechanism applies. Collaborative discretion of the KeeperDAO core team and the community can amend this.\n\n## Risks\n\n- This involves substantial use of DAO treasury funds, gaining exposure to a volatile and risky asset.\n- Convex and Curve smart contracts have been audited, but still carry smart contract risk (see below).\n- CVX price could move outside of our parameters before the acquisition is completed. In addition, this position incurs opportunity costs that may limit other potential uses of those funds or alternative strategies.\n\n### Security reviews\n\n- [Convex Review by Defisafety ](https://docs.defisafety.com/finished-reviews/convex-finance-process-quality-review), July 2021\n- [Curve Review by Defisafety](https://docs.defisafety.com/v/0.6/finished-reviews/curve-finance-process-quality-audit), October 2020\n\n## Appendix\n\n[Notion Appendix ](https://keeperdao-labs.notion.site/Convex-Acquisition-Appendix-a9b5149cbb3b4cf297d25b0ea5958e2f)\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Purchase between 1 and 2 million CVX before the end of 2021\n2. Establish a system to accept bribes for CVX vote\n3. Establish Curve v2 Pool\n4. Use 1,000 ROOK (from the DAO treasury) as bribes for voters for the gauge\n\n",

The overall cadence of the governance process is slowed by a 7 day open no objection voting period, while it seems nearly all participation occurs within the first 48 to 72 hours. If our goal is to be frictionless with agreement, and slower-moving with more opaque consensus, we should lower the minimum objection period for a vote to 72 hours, while letting Sophons choose to use the customary week for more hotly contested subjects.\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Lower minimum objection voting period to 72 hours, while allowing Sophons to choose another period (such as the current 7 day period) where consensus is less clear.\n\n",

      "content": "\n---\n\n**This is an apparent consensus vote.**\n\n* Vote 'No objection' if you agree with the proposal.\n* Vote 'Object' if you disagree with the proposal.\n\n**Discussion**\n* [Github](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-6/KIP-6.md)\n* [Forum discussion](https://forum.keeperdao.com/t/kip-draft-yield-generation-on-maple-finance/157)\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/jmr5QGt3MQ)\n\n---\n\n**NOTE**: *This is an abbreviated form of the KIP suitable for Snapshot. Please read the full proposal using the GitHub link above.*\n\n## Proposal \n\nThe proposal is for KeeperDAO to invest 3,500,000 USDC in the liquidity pool where Maven 11 is a Pool Delegate. This amount of USDC would represent 3.1% of the value of KeeperDAO treasury’s assets, or ~12% of the total stablecoin assets in KeeperDAOs treasury. Providing this amount of USDC to the liquidity pool would maintain risk at an appropriate level with negligible risk for the overall financial health of the DAO.\n\nThe main purpose of utilizing a portion of stablecoins held by the KeeperDAO treasury to provide liquidity on Maple Finance is to **generate an additional yield on now-idle assets** . This will enhance the capital efficiency of the treasury, the value of which will ultimately find its way back to the members of the DAO.\n\n\n**_Rewards_**\n\nLenders receive 80% of the interest payments from the borrowers in USDC, while the remaining 20% is distributed in a 50:50 split to the Maple Finance treasury and the PD. On top of that, Maple Finance provides incentives to the lenders in their native governance token MPL which can be used for staking (i.e. providing capital of last resort in case of defaults) and for governance of the protocol and the treasury.\n\n**To summarize** , depositing USDC in the Maven 11 liquidity pool on Maple Finance will generate two different flavors of yield: yield in USDC, and yield in the MPL governance token.\n\n- USDC yield, which currently hovers around 10% APY. This yield is subject to a 90 day lock up.\n- MPL reward token yield, which currently hovers around 25% APY. These reward tokens are released on a block by block basis.\n\nThis means that at time of writing, the total APY on USDC deposits is **roughly 35%** .\n\n**_The APY itself is dependent on 3 factors:_**\n\n1. **Interest rates** - when the interest rates among the borrowers in the pool are increasing, the USDC part of yield is increasing as well (and vice versa).\n2. **Amount of liquidity in the pool** - when the pool increases in size, the rewards in MPL are decreasing proportionally as the number of MPL tokens needs to be distributed among a larger number of participants (and vice versa).\n3. **MPL price** - when the price of MPL is increasing, the rewards in MPL are higher in $ terms, effectively increasing the APY (and vice versa).\n\n\n## Risks\n\nFor a full risk statement, please see the full proposal text on GitHub: https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-6/KIP-6.md\n\n## Additional links\n\n[KeeperDAO treasury address](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x9a67F1940164d0318612b497E8e6038f902a00a4/balances)\n\n[Maple Finance app ](https://app.maple.finance/#/liquidity)\n\n[Guide to lending on Maple ](https://maplefinance.ghost.io/lending/)\n\n[Maple Finance Dune Dashboard](https://dune.xyz/scottincrypto/Maple-Deposits)\n\n[Maple Finance AML KYC procedure ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ShpjSeYxEkUq63qIaR1Nmq8zT-BnWIWb/view?usp=sharing)\n\n[Master Loan Agreement (MLA) ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yy0E9LwS4y4bpyJ9syM7oMgA01cJKNrB-x0PI5Pw_Tg/)\n\n[Maple Finance API docs](https://maplefinance.gitbook.io/maple/api/public)\n\n[Credit Memo ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LL2z9gIFpq4hT-PblyF_s4-GXGO_4tUVAc3oViE1rJE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Specification\n\n**1.** On Maple Finance, approve USDC to spend\n**2.** Deposit 3,500,000 USDC to the Maven 11 liquidity pool and receive Maple Pool Tokens (MPT), to be eligible for receiving USDC rewards\n**3.** Approve MPT to spend\n**4.** Stake MPT in Maple Finance, to be eligible for receiving MPL governance token rewards\n\n\n\n",

Address: 0x3D71d79C224998E608d03C5Ec9B405E7a38505F0\n\n## Summary\n\nIncreasing the value of the ROOK token and keeping the community motivated and united because of this was not a priority until now. Since we do have a lot of funds into the treasury (around **$100m**) to cover all sort of development and expansion related costs, we could and should use a decent part of the future Ninja profits to buy back ROOK tokens from the open market and burn them.\n\nAt current revenue level, this 100% will translate into approximately **$800k being used for the buy back every month.**\n\n## Benefits\n1) Create constant buying pressure on ROOK token that would result in an increase of ROOK market price\n2) Reduce the total ROOK token supply by burning\n3) Create a solid use-case and a reason for people to hold ROOK tokens\n4) Keep the community motivated and united by giving back to the token holders some of the profits generated\n5) By creating a positive vibe, the community will further drive the adoption of the protocol\n6) Legally speaking, the buy back and burn does not affect us long term, proved by many other projects\n7) The buy back and burn is super easy to market and drive awareness trough media channels since is a very well received and hyped concept and would be forever one of the main reasons people will like hold the token.\n8) The buy back will work together with the limit orders that are discussed here: https://forum.keeperdao.com/t/place-a-limit-buy-order-on-rook-token/87/9 Having the buy back in place will reduce the chances these limit orders fill.\n\n### Risk and downsides\n1) Will result in slowing down the increase of the treasury since Ninja profits will go there from now on\n\n## Background\n\nPlease see the original draft here: https://forum.keeperdao.com/t/buy-back-and-burn-initiative/67/21\n\n## Proposal\n\nUse 100% of Ninja profits to buy back and burn ROOK, once a week. This lasts until the Coordination Game and new related tokenomics are live. \nThis buy back should be done randomly, regularly, and at least once a week, reducing the risk of it being exploited and increase the efficiency.",

      "content": "\n---\n\n**This is an apparent consensus vote.**\n\n* Vote 'No objection' if you agree with the proposal.\n* Vote 'Object' if you disagree with the proposal.\n\n**Discussion**\n* [Github](https://github.com/keeperdao/kips/blob/master/KIP-3/KIP-3.md)\n* [Forum discussion](https://forum.keeperdao.com/t/kip-3-labs-budget-september-december-2021/63/)\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/jmr5QGt3MQ)\n\n---\n\n### Proposal\nAllocate 865 ROOK for KeeperDAO Labs for September through December 2021.\n\n### Background\nIn the Land of Ooo, in the time before KIPs, KeeperDAO Labs Individual Contributors (ICs) have been budgeted in 4-8 week allocations for foreseeable needs like development. Ad hoc Individual Contributors were paid on completion of a given project. This budget proposal takes similar form, with intent to continue this work, while also adding three new IC roles (with flexibility for a fourth).\n\nRecent and current allocations can be found at 0xbBB8c9Ace4590d98f0A56FA311C6fBA0CEA3a68D, which has a budget lifespan that will last until October 4. With the ribbon-cutting of governance, it is time for budgets to be collectively assessed and ICs to be paid from a multi-sig.\n\n## Definitions\n**Ad Hoc** expenses are expenses which are paid on a case by case basis. These will be documented and published quarterly.\n\n**ICs (Individual Contributors)** are individuals who contribute to the development of the DAO in a formal sense.\n\n**Recurring** expenses are expenses which are paid on a cyclical schedule\n\n## Requested budget breakdown \n\n| Purpose | ROOK Allocation\n|---|---|\n| Engineering | 400 |\n| Partner Outreach Development | 120 |\n| Translations | 50 |\n| Discord Bot Development | 45 |\n| Community Grants | 250 |\n| **Total** | **865** |\n\n### Engineering budget\nWe will continue our two IC Engineers who are paid weekly at 10 ROOK/week: @shadow and @pangolin. Their KeeperDAO work can be noticed with performance and design improvements throughout app.keeperdao.com. \n\nI also introduce a new role which we will be recruiting for: *Partner Integrations Engineer*. This role will be focused on assisting our partners with integration.\n\nAdditional discretionary funds for another IC role is included in case it is needed. If unused, it will roll over to the Quarter 1 2022 Budget.\n\nThese are *recurring* roles.\n\nAt a rate of 10 ROOK/week for all of the above, the sum is 400 ROOK.\n\n| IC | Duration (weeks) | ROOK\n|---|---|---|\n| @pangolin | 13 | 130\n| @shadow | 4 | 40\n| Partner Integrations (TBD) | 11 | 110\n| Discretionary (TBD) | 11 | 110\n| **Total** | **39** | **400**\n\n### Partner outreach development\nWe are seeking someone to support connecting and facilitating relationships with potential partners. I believe @destroyr is a perfect candidate for both, and should be contracted as a `Partner Outreach Developer`. Troy has been involved in the space for several years, going back to helping Nano grow in 2017 and has also been intimately involved in KeeperDAO helping with documentation, web copy, and research.\n\nThis is a *recurring* role.\n\nAt a rate of 8 ROOK/week for all of the above, the sum is 120 ROOK.\n| IC | Duration (weeks) | ROOK\n|---|---|---|\n| @destroyr  | 15 | 120\n| **Total** | **15** | **120**\n\n### Translations\nWe need translations for our many webpages and documents. We recently added German but we have some loose ends, and we should add support for Spanish. This is to fund that.\n\nThese are *ad hoc* roles.\n\n| Group | Ad Hoc ROOK Allocation\n|---|---|\n| Translators | 50 |\n| **Total** | **50**\n\n### Discord bot development\nThere are several bots for Discord we would like to add which are relevant to current products as well as future products. This is an open role, and can be filled by multiple bot developers (dividing and conquering is fine for this project).\n\nThis an *ad hoc* role.\n\n| Group | Ad Hoc ROOK Allocation\n|---|---|\n| Discord Bot Development | 45 |\n| **Total** | **45**\n\n### Community grants\nWith the birth of decentralized KeeperDAO Governance, I anticipate many small projects to come up to foster community growth, accelerate development, discover and support partners, and so forth.\n\nThe projects decided will largely be community-decided, community-driven, and community-developed. This will be completed transparently and also documented and compiled for a reviewable budget summary at the end of Quarter 4.\n\n| Group | Ad Hoc ROOK Allocation\n|---|---|\n| Community | 250 |\n| **Total** | **250**\n\n## Special considerations\n\n### Excess ROOK Rollover\nIf excess ROOK exists (due to an IC role not being filled, an ad hoc need becoming unneeded, an IC needing a week off, etc.), excess ROOK will carry over to the next quarter.\n\n### Retroactive payment\n\nThis KIP was targeting a September approval; the structure or intentions do not change. Due to the delay, some contributors are working on good faith so some of these above payments will be paid retroactively. That is all.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n1. Before October 4, send 865 ROOK (and 1 Eth for gas) to a new multi-sig address. It will be managed like the IC address has been for the prior few months, with payments on Mondays for recurring ICs or on project completion by ad hoc ICs. The address will be managed by ~3 Core/Labs members (including myself). I volunteer @WhatsTheDeetz and @Pai-Sho (if they have the bandwidth). I volunteer these two because @WhatsTheDeetz is involved in all things community and @Pai-Sho is helping coordinate Labs engineering.\n\n2. Pay ICs on recurring or ad hoc schedule throughout the coming quarter.\n\n3. Recruit `Partner Integrations Engineer`, `Discord Bot Developers`, and a `Spanish Translator`.\n\n4. By December 31, @lapras will summarize expenditures, assess rollover, and work with the community to decide if this model worked well and should be standardized and extended (with quarterly budgets).\n\n",

Mint 1299.375 ROOK\n 2. Transfer the minted ROOK to the Hiding Vault distributor contract [0xae7b93a591c37ea37ed8bc7b6b999c85f2ed2405](https://etherscan.io/address/0xae7b93a591c37ea37ed8bc7b6b999c85f2ed2405).\n 3. Reduce the per-block reward factor for Hiding Vaults by 75%.\n\n## Background\n\nNow that the Hiding Vault has been established as an enhanced lending protocol, both in total value locked (TVL) and total amount borrowed, I proposing that we reduce the amount of ROOK that is emitted to users of the Hiding Vault.\n\n* Hiding Vaults already receive significant benefits from Compound (interest and COMP distribution) and JITU (liquidity buffer). The ROOK rewards should be some (light) icing on the cake. \n\n* Hiding Vault rewards are not currently motivating users to take positions that create MEV. Until we are able to dynamically distribute rewards to different assets in an effort to dissuade same token supply and borrowing, the Hiding Vault will not be utilized to its full potential. \n\nFor reference, here is the current remaining emissions for the last quarter of Act IV: \n\n|Name|Percentage|# ROOK this Act|# ROOK per day|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Hiding Vault|40|5197.5|231| \n|Hiding Game|40|5197.5|231|\n|Liquidity Pools|20|2598.75|115.5| \n|Total|100|12993.75|577.5|\n\nNote: Hiding Game and LP emissions have been fully minted for Act IV and cannot be adjusted until the beginning of Act V.\n\nAssuming that this could go live right as the third quarter of Act IV's emissions for Hiding Vault that were minted run out, the final proposed ROOK rewards for Act IV's final quarter would be: \n\n|Name|Percentage|# ROOK Remaining |# ROOK per day|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Hiding Game|40|5197.5|231|\n|Hiding Vault|10|1299.375|57.75|\n|Liquidity Pools|20|2598.75|115.5|\n|Not Minted|30|3898.125|0|\n|Total|100|12993.75|462|\n\n\n\n",

Finally, it defines governance helpers called Sophons that coordinate the governance process.\n\n### Proposal\nAdopt the specified guidelines below, defining the KeeperDAO governance.\n\n## KeeperDAO improvement proposals\n\n### What is a KIP?\nA KIP is a proposal that an author or group of authors would like to be evaluated by the members of KeeperDAO. The members of KeeperDAO shall work with the author of a KIP to review and refine its content, before using an agreed-upon consensus procedure to collectively determine whether to adopt or decline the final proposal. \n\n### Minimum style requirements\nA KIP should be written in plain language, formatted as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). It should clearly and completely describe the proposal, its motivations, and why the author believes it improves the status quo. Where applicable, it should also describe a set of steps to enact the proposal. Authors and editors should work together to ensure that the KIP meets at least the following minimum style requirements:\n\n- **Consistency**: Does it contradict itself or any other non-historical KIP?\n- **Accuracy**: Are its data, arguments, and understanding of systems complete, accurate, and up-to-date?\n- **Feasibility**: Does it propose or require things that are impossible ot impractical to accomplish?\n- **Verifiability**: Can anyone verify for themselves that an implemention did occur in the way described by the KIP?\n\n\n### Recordkeeping\nKIPs form an archival series, meaning that each KIP has a unique archival serial number, and is not able to have its essential content changed once it has become finalized. At the top of every KIP is a header which contains metadata that editors can use to help organize the governance record. \n\n\n\nThese fields and their values may be changed in the governance repository without the need for a new consensus, as long as the change is recorded in the repository and carried out by those delegated to do so.\n\n## Governance lifecycle\n\n1. Author posts KIP draft on forum \n    1. When a new KIP appears on the forum, a notification and summary shall be posted to a relevant channel.\n\n2. Crowd Consensus\n    1. The author shall allow sufficient time for, and make a best effort to reach, rough consensus with the community about the content of the draft proposal. \n    2. When the author determines that rough consensus has been reached, the author shall communicate their intention to submit the proposal to the governance record for review.\n    3. The author shall make a best effort to allow sufficient time for all interested parties to post final comments on the draft before formal submission.\n    \n3. Merge to Git repository\n    1. The author shall open a pull request to the governance repository, aided by a Sophon if necessary.\n    2. A Sophon shall add the header fields to the KIP, and mark its status as `draft`, before merging it.\n\n4. Sophon Consensus\n    1. Sophons shall maintain a public queue of the merged KIPs to be reviewed. This queue shall be ordered chronologically according to the date of the git merge.\n    2. Sophons must make a best effort to review each KIP in order, and acheive rough consensus.\n    3. When a KIP enters review, a Sophon shall change the KIP status from `draft` to `review`.\n       1. During review, Sophons shall make a best effort to conduct their deliberations in public and record minutes, as well as be available for public feedback.\n       2. If Sophons cannot reach rough consensus, the proposal will return to `draft` status.\n       3. Otherwise, the Sophons will assign the KIP a voting period and change its status from `review` to `last-call`.\n\n5. Last call period\n    1. Sophons and the KIP author shall make efforts to notify interested parties, allow sufficient time to facilitate discussion, and uncover any remaining objection or correction to the proposal before objection voting begins.\n\n5. Objection Voting\n    1. Objection voting shall run for a minimum of 7 days, except for matters which present a clear, imminent danger to users, protocols, or the DAO.\n    2. The vote shall have two options, 'No objection' and 'Object', and shall include a prominent message explaining the difference between apparent consensus and majority voting.\n    3. Best effort shall be made to notify interested parties about the objection vote once it is live.\n    \n6. Ratification\n   1. If enough tokens select the 'Object' option at the close of the vote, the KIP does not have tokenholder consensus, and it returns to `draft` status. If there is a non-zero quorum requirement, and not enough tokens have selected the 'No objection' option, then the proposal is returned to `draft` status. Otherwise, the proposal is assigned `final` status.\n   2. The result of the vote shall be communicated via Discord and Twitter.\n\n## Sophons \n\nSophons are individuals empowered by the DAO to review, analyze, and publish non-binding recommendations on KIPs. They should \"speak for the protocol,\" rather than their own interests, and be knowledgeable about the subjects being considered. \n\nTheir role is to ensure that every KIP has been given adequate attention before it is put in front of tokenholders for a vote, and that tokenholders are provided with the opinion of qualified stakeholders in case they cannot judge for themselves.\n\n### Sophon onboarding process \n\nThis section defines a process for onboarding one or more Sophons. \n\nUse the template located at [KIP-0-T1.md](./KIP-0-T1.md).\n\n### Sophon offboarding process \n\nThis section defines a process for offboarding one or more Sophons.\n\nUse the template located at [KIP-0-T2.md](./KIP-0-T2.md)\n",
