      "title": "Lobster Moloch | Sudo Pool on Optimism.",
      "content": "### Overview:\nSilo would like to help LobsterDAO build Sudoswap LP in a Moloch Treasury on Optimism, and create an incentive program for a Research Publishing Cooperative, governed by LobsterDAO.\n\n* Sudoswap deploys to Optimism.\n* Crustaceans bridge to OP, and claim shares to a Moloch Treasury.\n* LobsterDAO Members Contribute ETH and NFTs into the DAO.\n* LobsterDAO Members Recieve $CRABS\n    * A Deflationary, Rage-Quit enabled token, which can be earned by members who publish quailty research, on behalf of LobsterDAO.\n    * DAO owned CRABS LP is listed on Velodrome, and earns VELO emissions.\n    * DAO owned SUDO LP is managed on Sudoswap on Optimism.\n\nWe are using Moloch v3, and ERC 6551.\n* https://moloch.daohaus.fun/\n* https://tokenbound.org/\n\n### Funding Request:\n\nThis proposal requires custom development, and devs from DAOhaus and Raid Guild are requesting 10 ETH. Paid half up front, and half on delivery. \n\nIn return, we can offer: \n\n* 10,000 SILO\n    * Seed Round, Loot Shares for https://silo.gg/\n    * [DAO](https://admin.daohaus.fun/#/molochv3/0xa/0x7551eeb016d0c1c8315611053d30bd90d1a4b09b) | [Etherscan](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x36138bb223ffe0c69d99b5affc07800aa3f9e346)\n* 0% Fees, and we use LobsterDAO as a Case Study.\n\nFollowing this trial, we can partner with Sudoswap to use these tools to serve other NFT Communities, and fair launch pools for newly minted projects on ARB | OP | BASE | MAINNET.\n\nDevelopment has been grassroots funded by the team, some frens, DAOhaus and Alchemix.\n\nSudoswap | LobsterDAO would be our next major partners, and we would be open to a funding split between Sudo and LobsterDAO.\n\n### Mainnet <> OP Bridge Integration\n\nThere are a couple of different options for Mainnet <> OP Bridging, but they would need some custom work.\n* The Celer Bridge currently doesn't go to Optimism. \n* The LayerZero Bridges seem L2 <> L2.\n* The Qx Project is depreciated, and the bridge doesn't function.\n* Tokenbound is working on a gasless cross-chain experience for mainnet <> OP, but it is not complete yet.\n\nDekan, from DAOhaus has expressed that he believes the Celer bridge would be a good choice.\n\n### Moloch Treasury Claim & Airdrop\n\nAfter Bridging, Crustaceans will claim their Tokenbound Account, and a Baal Shaman will mint soulbound SHARES into that account.\n\nYour Crustacean now has Voting and Rage Quit rights over a Moloch Treasury on Optimism.\n\nEach LobsterDAO member who bridges and claims will recieve 100 CRABS as a reward.\n\nGovernance Power can be Delegated, and must be re-delegated after sale.\n\n#### SHARES: Vote Weight by Species: \nSHARES primarily represent Governance power, and are soulbound to your Crustacean's TBA.\n\n* Shrimp: 10\n* Mudcrab: 15\n* Langoustine: 20 \n* Lobster: 25\n\nThese weights offer slight voting power advantages to more rare species. \n\nCustom development is needed to have the Baal Shaman check the Species Traits and distribute weighted SHARES.\n\n### $CRABS as Economic Rights\n\nCRABS is a LOOT Token, which represents a pro-rata claim on the Main Treasury. \n\nCRABS will have a 1,000,000 Max Supply.\n\n#### 50% of Supply can be claimed by Crustaceans who take the following actions: \n\n* All Crustaceans who Bridge to OP, and Claim their SHARES recieve 100 CRABS. \n* Contribute a Minimum of .4 ETH and you get 400 CRABS.\n    * You can contribute more ETH, for the same ratio.\n* Contribute 1 Lobster NFT of any type, and you get 500 CRABS.\n\nCustom work will needed to accept NFTs in exchange for LOOT, but this would be useful for DAO owned Sudo LP, and would likely create a Shrimp Supply Sink whose floor price is managed by the DAO.\n\nAny remainder of this 50% supply will be distributed amongst participants: \n\n* 1x for Migration\n* 2x for ETH Contribution \n* 3x for ETH and Lobster Contribution\n\nTo maximize your CRABS, Crustaceans can take all three actions before the DAO closes the onboarding period.\n\nContributed funds are placed in the Non-RQ Treasury\n\n* 45% of ETH Raised purchases and max locks veVELO.\n* 45% of ETH Raised and all Lobster NFTs go to Sudoswap LP.\n* 10% of ETH Raised goes to DAO owned CRABS/wETH LP on Velodrome.\n\n#### 10% of Supply is reserved in a Non-RQ Vault to be used as DAO Owned LP.\n\n#### 10% of Supply is reserved in a Non-RQ Vault to be used as Velodrome Bribes.\n\n#### 30% of Supply is reserved in a Non-RQ Vault to be earned by Research Contributors.\n* CRABS are awarded to Researcher Contributors retroactively when they publish worthy Articles | Videos | Threads.\n* LobsterDAO evaluates the quality of these submissions as a group:\n    * Was the research was data driven?\n    * Did the publishing reach an audience?\n    * Did the publishing adequately represent LobsterDAO?\n\nThe Tokenomics above are designed to meet Velodrome's [listing criteria](https://working-busby-414.notion.site/AERO-Whitelist-f4e0b99031ed4f349677088dd0c5d423#31f527ddd5ad4113bfcc72987b8d8c3d) for Emissions Gauges, while raising funds for DAO owned Sudoswap and CRABS LP.\n\nThe Allocations of Raised ETH are designed to help the treasury qualify for OP Incentives from Velodrome, and empower the DAO to market make on Sudo.\n\n### Velodrome Gauge Qualification & Incentives\n\nveVELO held by the DAO is used to direct VELO emissions to CRABS LP.\n\nVelodrome Relay, will be released soon, which will provide automated vote and compound strategies, simplifying maintenance.\n\nRewards for purchasing veVELO, and providing bribes for CRABS LP can include:\n* a 20k OP GovNFT\n* Rebates on Locked veVELO\n* Bribe Matching.\n\nMore about their incentive programs on this [Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/0xkhmer/velodrome-x-optimism).\n\nIn general, the DAO ought to aim for 1M veVELO, and claim the 1 Year Vested 20k OP GovNFT.\n\n### Sudoswap Deploy to OP\n\nSudoswap has been working toward fulfilling their roadmap, and deploying on an L2.\n\nOwen offered to trial Moloch, on an L2.\n\nThis proposal was designed in response, so LobsterDAO could put it to a vote.\n\n#### The Problem:\n\nMost NFT value is on Mainnet, but in order to try out more complex governance strategies, you need affordable L2 gas costs. \n\n#### The Solution:\n\nCrustaceans who Bridge to OP, and fund this Moloch DAO are creating a new type of governance experiment on Optimism. \n\nIf Crustaceans find an OP Research Cooperative and LP DAO to be useful and fun, then more groups might migrate. \n\nNew OP native NFT Communities could be minted.\n\nThose NFT Membership groups would use Sudoswap and Velodrome.\n\nIf these experiments work out, we could also launch Mainnet collections who raise DAO owned Sudo LP directly from Mint.\n\n#### The Alternative: \n\nYou could take that 10 ETH, and deposit it into Sudo on Mainnet, and deploy a Gnosis Safe multi-sig to manage the LP.\n\n### Conclusion: \n\nVote YES: \n\nExecute plan as described.\n\n* 5 ETH to Silo and recieve 5000 SILO now. \n* 5 ETH to Silo and recieve 5000 SILO on completion. \n\nVote NO: \n\nLobsterDAO will pursue Mainnet Sudoswap LP, with a multi-sig.",

      "content": "Good day, seafood.\n\nOver the course of the last few months, opensea-blur-sudo and other platforms have changed their views on royalties. For example, Opensea allows sellers to set up a 0% fee... LOL! Meanwhile, the actual protocols (sudoswap) has set in stone fees which is 10% as you can see via the links in the previous proposal.\n\nThe point is, right now fees are un-harmonized, and it might be good to harmonize it. Given people can go via Opensea and have 0% or do OTC... maybe the overall fee size needs to be looked over as a result? Anyway, this all needs fixing or it becomes a little bit dumb.\n\nAs such, proposing for all marketplaces & pools:\n- option 1: reduce the fee to 5%\n- option 2: reduce the fee to 2% \n- option 3: reduce the fee to 0%\n- option 4: do nothing and change to 7.5% everywhere as initially [keep in mind, on opensea people can still sell at 0% then lol]\n\nThe old initial rules which were never changed, can be found here https://github.com/lobster-dao/overview.

Focused on the Metaverse the channel will bring all the creative energy you'll remember from Robin's Defiant videos without all the boring 'guy sits at a desk and talks' stuff. We're taking on big challenges, big ideas and big risks to tell the story of the Metaverse from the inside out. \n\nBasedHeads\nThe BasedHeads are a 10k strong collection of... oh god... yes... he said it. It's another bloody collection of bloody pfp BS #%$#^&$.\n\nWell, yeah. Because, the BasedHeads represent our audience. The Creator Economy has been magnificent at building two immense pillars: \n\n1. Build your audience (aka, clickbait)\n2. Monetize your audience (aka, clicks for bucks)\n\nWe think there should be a third pillar - Share the Spoils. An NFT collection gives us a powerful way to start figuring out what that can be.

Date TBC but end of first week of Jan is looking most likely. \n\nWL price is .08 ETH\nPublic mint price is .1 ETH\n\nhttps://based-af.com/ (website coming shortly)\n\nMuch love as always\n\nRobin (SuperMassive)",

You share jobs from tr3butor in your community and earn up to $10K for each successful hire.\n> \n\nRecently, we have launched our Job Board, with more than 150 organizations onboarded and a variety of ready-to-apply opportunities ranging from jobs to grants and hackathons. \n\n👉 Website: [tr3butor.io](http://tr3butor.io) \n\n👉 Job Board: [app.tr3butor.io](http://app.tr3butor.io) \n\n👉 Blog: [https://medium.com/@tr3butor.io](https://medium.com/@tr3butor.io)\n\n👉 Twitter: [https://twitter.com/tr3butor](https://twitter.com/tr3butor)\n\n👉 Discord: [https://t.co/t2cLzKXuSK](https://t.co/t2cLzKXuSK)\n\n## Hey, **Lobsters!**\n\nAs we launched the tr3butor recently, we would love to invite the community of LobsterDAO to test out our product and learn from your feedback & suggestions on the platform and community. \n\nWe would love to propose a partnership between LobsterDAO and tr3butor, in which: \n\n### Benefits for Lobsters:\n\n- Allocation of 20 tr3butor Genesis NFTs to the LobsterDAO treasury. The NFT gives you beta access, exclusive offers, airdrops, influence over the future tr3butor DAO, and much more.\n- All LOBS holders will get whitelisted for ‘Contributor’ & ‘Explorer’ OATs, 2 of 3 ‘achievements’ one needs to collect to mint tr3butor Genesis NFT for free.\n    - More details about tr3butor Genesis NFT: [https://mirror.xyz/tr3butor.eth/zdjqIkQLrCT5IeAYNRyFTpemkuBhcdTMQDaPyELZTsU](https://mirror.xyz/tr3butor.eth/zdjqIkQLrCT5IeAYNRyFTpemkuBhcdTMQDaPyELZTsU)\n- All LOBS founders / DAO operators get priority onboarding for their organizations to the platform.\n- tr3butor team will prepare a weekly collection of jobs to share with the Lobster community via LobsterHR. LobstersDAO will earn $3-30K to the treasury for every successful hire.\n- Displaying Lobster NFT as an on-chain credential on contributor profiles at tr3butor and other integrations.\n\nIf this proposal pass, \n\n- we (Lobsters) will start occasionally posting jobs from tr3butor on LobsterHR chat https://t.me/lobsters_hr\n- if there is a hire via lobsters, LobsterDAO treasury will get a referral fee\n- and all things mentioned in benefits both for Lobs holders and DAO treasury.\n",

      "title": "LobsterDAO LPing in SudoSwap",
      "content": "Hi seafood kingdom!\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to deploy 15% of lobsterdao ETH & WETH treasury (that would be around 23 ETH mark right now) and a corresponding number of lobsterdao floor-trait treasury NFTs   (approximately 30 pieces with the slope of the curve suggested) - into a newly created sudoswap pool with a 2.5% fee and a slope of 3.8% exponential. That is more or less in line with the current price gap of LooksRare and Opensea listings. \n\n## Introduction\n\nA few of you have heard of the narratives around DeFi x NFTs… Be it aggregators like Gem (bought by Opensea) and Genie (bought by Uniswap), LooksRare, and so on. One of the latest ones getting quite some attention - is [Sudoswap](https://twitter.com/sudoswap), made by anons [0xmon](https://twitter.com/0xmons), [statelayer](https://twitter.com/statelayer), and a few other CT dwellers. All of whom are actually lobsterdao holders & supporters too!\n\nWhy do this:\n- lobsterdao collection and its community are researchers, so when a new primitive pops up - it could be fun & admirable to support it. Especially if it’s created by community members who have also been lobsters for a long time.\n- 0xmon and statelayer and others have not yet raised funding or announced any conversion plans, so why not dabble with the perspectives of receiving something in the future. So far the protocol has been live and integrated around a bit with no hacks surrounding it, so it’s not too much of a risky bet. As such, a safe 15% was chosen too.\n- It also improves the liquidity and can serve as a piece od DeFi for the times when protocols could possibly price these pools properly and allow LP tokens as collateral.\n\nThis initiative does not mean that sudoswap is partnering with lobsters or that any substantial support will be given - for that, sudoswap team should instead suggest and bribe lobsters to continue. This proposal is just getting the ball rolling forward. Cheers.\n",

And, lobsterdao NFT holders are in the spotlight there! They give extra scores, a separate badge, and overall increase our visibility among the audience that we are ourselves are - not BAYC seed-giving people, but DeFi degens, whales, and shadowy supercoders. \n\nTo commemorate that, DS asked to gib em 10 lobsterdao NFTs as a prize for their v2 launch. Those would be given 1 each to the most severe degens who likely will have some of the largest balances. Great visibility!

      "content": "LobsterDAO<>TrueFreeze Partnership proposal \n\n***Important:*** \n- If you have more questions about the proposal or wanna start a discussion, do it [here - GitHub discussion](https://github.com/lobster-dao/overview/issues/60) or [here - Gated TG chat](https://telegram.me/collablandbot?start=VFBDI1RFTCNDT01NIy0xMDAxNTc3NzExMjQx)\n\n- [here is a link to the project spotlight](https://twitter.com/freeze_llc/status/1511078082777653248)\n\n### What is TrueFreeze?\nWe've created an immutable/permissionless on-chain Certificates of Deposit ecosystem for blockchain native assets. You lock ETH for your chosen amount of time. You get paid a yield token, frETH as a F(amount, time). You also mint a Freezer NFT representing your deposit. The yield token's value (in ETH) is determined by the free market.\n\nYou get 1 frETH for locking 1 ETH out of circulation for 1 year. This is why we call it a \"proof of patience\".\n\nThe Freezer NFTs can be traded on any NFT marketplace and they function exactly the same way as zero-coupon bonds for pricing purposes. This is the key innovation of True Freeze- making it possible to buy ETH with ETH, e.g., buying a 50 ETH Freezer NFT that matures in 1 year for < 50 ETH.\n\nThis is risk minimized DeFi. No oracles, no liquidations, no collateral, no impermanent loss. Pure money for on-chain proof of patience.\n\nThe engine behind all of this is the FRZ revenue token. If you are patient and your CD matures, you can withdraw your ETH for 0% frETH fees and 0% ETH penalty (i.e., you earned all the frETH you minted and were paid upfront). BUT- early withdrawals require X frETH and 0.25% ETH penalty. Where X is a G(amount, time) and G() > F() for the first 66% of the lock time (see diagram here: https://truefreeze.xyz/mechanics#redeem)\n\nThese early withdrawal fees go to stakers of the FRZ token.\n\nTo maintain a multi-century anti-fragile tokenomics design; FRZ inflates (see here: https://truefreeze.xyz/mechanics#frz)\n\nThis inflation taxes holders of FRZ and forces them into a \"Curve War\" style fight to accumulate newly inflated FRZ to retain their % of revenue flow. Newly minted FRZ is distributed to everyone who has ever burnt frETH. Burning frETH earns a proportional new FRZ forever. (See the Curve War parallel?)\n\nFor more details on why this is sustainable tokenomics see the \"Flywheel\" diagram here: https://truefreeze.xyz/tokenomics#flywheel\n\n👉 [Website](https://truefreeze.xyz)\n👉 [Docs](https://truefreeze.xyz/mechanics)\n👉 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/freeze_true)\n\n### Welcome Lobsters!\nDeep Freeze LLC is a very small scrappy team trying to do something cool in public goods. We aren't equipped to create a DAO, run operations, a multi-sig, found a team, raise money, etc. to monopolize on this product. So we want to find DAOs/Protocols to adopt this public good.\n\nAll the code is done and its been audited. We're launching in two weeks. We are already planning to airdrop the FRZ revenue token to Lobster Holders. But we wanted to do something interesting and also airdrop to DAOs.\n\n### Benefits to Lobsters\nWe'd like to airdrop 2% of the initial FRZ supply on ETH to the LobsterDAO multi-sig. This would function as a grant for you all to fund your building. You can stake it, grant it, etc. We hope you don't dump immediately, but technically can't stop you.\n\nIdeal scenario is that by doing this, LobsterDAO has a sense of ownership (along with other recipients) of the public good and feels inclined to use True Freeze, help market it so people claim the airdrop, and maybe even build automated strategies on top of it or integrate it into other products.\n\nThank you! See PDF version of explainer here:\n[Deep Freeze Explainer.pdf](https://github.com/lobster-dao/overview/files/8612052/Deep.Freeze.Explainer.pdf)\n---\nVote YES - LobstersDAO officially works with TrueFreeze\nVote NO - LobstersDAO won't work officially with TrueFreeze. (Do note that we can't stop TrueFreeze to support Lobs on their end, but we will not endorse nor support it) \n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "LobsterDAO<>Gro Partnership proposal \n\n***Important:*** \n- If you have more questions about the proposal or wanna start a discussion, do it [here](https://t.me/lobsterdao)\n\n- [here is a link to the project spotlight](https://twitter.com/10b57e6da0/status/1504487731614736391)\n\n### What is Gro?\nGro is a DeFi protocol that aims to make earning stablecoin yield easy for everyone by combining the best of DeFi and traditional finance. \n- Its first products, PWRD and Vault, were created through risk-tranching so that users only need to choose between protection against protocol & stablecoin failures (PWRD) and leveraged higher yields (Vault).\n- Its most recent product, Labs, was built through automating leveraged yield farming to free its users from the complexity of managing it themselves.\n- Beyond stablecoins, Gro also has its own governance token $GRO that comes with an innovative vesting mechanism, where $GRO diamond hands earn tokens forfeited by those who leave before their vesting schedule is completed.  \n\n👉 [Website](https://www.gro.xyz/)\n👉 [App](https://app.gro.xyz/)\n👉 [Docs](https://docs.gro.xyz)\n👉 [Blog](https://groprotocol.medium.com)\n👉 [Twitter](https://twitter.com/groprotocol)\n👉 [Discord](https://discord.gg/gro)\n\n### Welcome Lobsters!\nWe would love to learn from DeFi power users in LobsterDAO and benefit from your feedback & suggestions on our protocol, particularly on our latest product Labs and the revamped GRO Rewards mechanism.  \n\nWe propose a mutual partnership in which:\nWe welcome as many Lobsters as possible to try Labs with a special higher allowance, which is otherwise only available for committed Gro DAO members\nWe invite Lobsters who have tried out Labs to the revamped v2 GRO Rewards Center with an initial $GRO allocation to facilitate participation \nProduct introduction:\n\n#1: Labs\nLabs is Gro’s first Avalanche product which delivers higher yields using automated leveraged yield farming strategies to Gro users at a much lower gas cost. Our first Labs strategies use Alpha Homora v2 on Avalanche. For more information about Labs, please see our introduction and the step-by-step “how to” guide.\n\n\n#2: GRO rewards\nGRO Rewards has been revamped to make our “Squid Game”-like vesting mechanism more flexible and rewarding to our long-term HODLers and yield farmers. Please see our original design here and the revised mechanism here.\n\n### Benefits to Lobsters\n- All LOBS holders (as of Sunday Mar 20 midnight UTC) will get whitelisted to access the upgraded Labs product (announced to the public on Thu Mar 17) with a higher deposit allowance of $75K total ($25k per vault in Labs section). Labs offers a hands-off way to earn high pure stablecoin yield at low gas cost.\n- LOBS holders that have deposited into Labs and held on for 2 weeks after depositing would get 300 vesting $GRO airdropped in their Gro Rewards center (total program capped at 100,000 $GRO) so that they can participate in our new Rewards mechanism that comes with 12-month vesting. Once they start vesting they can join the Squid Game-like Vesting Bonus Pool to claim bonus from other early-leavers. \n- $GRO token is a ticket to prioritised access to Gro’s future product releases, so Lobsters will be the first to learn about any new products. \n- Active Lobsters could also be nominated as Gro OGs — going one step beyond getting prioritised access to new products, our OGs will be the first to test new products before they launch. Their feedback will be incorporated into the launch version. Join our OGs to shape Gro’s product development before these products meet the world!\n- LobsterDAO Treasury would get 6,751 vesting $GRO tokens for introducing Gro to the active Lobster community – for every lobster that ended up trying out Labs product and getting 300 $GRO, LobsterDAO Treasury would receive an additional 67.51 vesting $GRO tokens which can then be used for claiming Vesting Bonus as frequently as every 4 weeks!\n\nHow the products look like \n\n![GroProduct](https://i.postimg.cc/zBf3LM8M/photo-2022-03-17-18-07-50.jpg)\n![GroProduct2](https://i.postimg.cc/J0krZCgT/photo-2022-03-17-18-10-33.jpg)\n---\nVote YES - LobstersDAO officially works with GRO\n\nVote NO - LobstersDAO won't work officially with GRO.

We help the best crypto projects (ex. Filecoin, Solana, Flow, etc.) throughout their life cycles and give early adopters access to quality crypto assets before mainstream exchanges.\n\n[CoinList Karma](https://blog.coinlist.co/introducing-coinlist-karma-earn-rewards-for-advancing-crypto/) is a reflection of users’ contributions to token networks on CoinList. The greater a user’s contribution through value-add activities (ex. staking, governance, etc.), the higher their Karma. Eligible users with high levels of Karma can earn access to the Priority Queue on CoinList, an invite-only queue for token sales that is significantly shorter than the main token sale queue.\n\nTo receive the benefits, eligible users need to:\n\n- Complete CoinList KYC at https://coinlist.co/lobsterdao-karma before 00:00 UTC, January 1, 2022.\n- Link your Ethereum address holding the Lobster NFT with your CoinList account by submitting your wallet address and signing a provided message at the end of the KYC flow (https://coinlist.co/lobsterdao-karma).\n- If you are eligible for the Karma airdrop and have an existing CoinList account, please use your existing account and do not create a new account.\n\n#### Note: holding more than 1 lobster per account WON'T increase your Karma points.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the LobsterDAO Karma Drop FAQ (https://coinlist.co/help/lobsterdao-karma-drop-faq). Thank you for supporting the CoinList community!\n\nVote YES - LobstersDAO officially works/endorse partnership with CoinList.\n\nVote NO - LobstersDAO won't work officially with CoinList.

Signer address holds Lobsters NFT (first month of users incentive program)**\n\nIf you hold a Lobster NFT on your signer address ( a browser wallet or hardware wallet that you use to sign transactions on the Ambire Wallet) you will receive a 1.5X liquidity mining multiplier for the 1 month of using Ambire Wallet.\n\n**2. Transfer your Lobster to Ambire wallet (as long as you hold Lobster in that wallet):**\n\nIf you transfer your Lobster NFT to Ambire Wallet you will continue having the 1.5X multiplier as long as you are holding the Lobster NFT into your Ambire wallet. (By the way, the wallet has an NFT dashboard which looks sleek)\n\nNote: holding more than 1 lobster per account WON'T increase your multiplier.\n---\nVote YES - LobstersDAO officially works with Ambire for the liquidity mining booster feature to go smooth.\n\nVote NO - LobstersDAO won't work officially with Ambire. (Do note that we can't stop Ambire to do boost, but we will not endorse nor support this) \n",

The bug appeared for those who provided the same address in the google sheet and to the Telegram bot. And/Or to those whose number was not updated in the first sheet.\n\nThose affected have been identified and confirmed in the Github Thread.\nThose are: \nCIA 3\nMdzor 3\nArtist 20\n\nThis Proposal is created to validate with votes that the missing NFTs could be distributed in a randomized way to the 3 contributors impacted or not.\n\nIf you press \"I Agree\" the NFT will be sent to the contributors as initially planned.\nIf you press \"I Disagree\" the NFT won't be sent and the contributors won't be compensated.",

That creates both potential legal liability and security/governance centralization threat. \n\nFortunately snapshot with gnosis created a module to automate the execution of governance proposals.\nhttps://blog.gnosis.pm/introducing-safesnap-the-first-in-a-decentralized-governance-tool-suite-for-the-gnosis-safe-ea67eb95c34f\n\nFrom LobsterDAO Github:\n\"The collection can have a snapshot page for governance\nSnapshot page https://snapshot.org/#/10b57e6da0.eth can be used together with multisig in order to decide what to do with NFTs or any other in the multisig. The collection or the NFTs have no governance over chats, rules, or anything else related to people. It's just governance for fun, and has no value or utility. It's just there to potentially align community in a better way.\"\n\nSo to maximize fun we propose to install SafeSnap module.\n ",
