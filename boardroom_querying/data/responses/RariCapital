      "title": "Proposal for the Dissolution and Redistribution of Rari Treasury Funds",
      "content": "Proposal Overview:\nI propose that we consider the dissolution of  Rari and the equitable redistribution of the treasury funds to our fellow shareholders. The intent behind this proposal is to present a comprehensive analysis of the pros and cons of such a course of action while taking into account the challenging performance we have endured during the prolonged bear market conditions.\n\nPros of Dissolution and Redistribution:\n\nCapital Recovery: Shareholders will have the opportunity to reclaim their initial investments, potentially mitigating the losses incurred during the extended bear market.\n\nStreamlined Governance: Dissolution will simplify our governance structure, reducing complexities and alleviating the administrative burden faced by our community.\n\nEnhanced Financial Flexibility: Shareholders will gain greater access to liquidity, granting them the freedom to explore alternative investment opportunities or address personal financial needs.\n\nCommitment to Transparency: Dissolving  Rari demonstrates our commitment to transparency and ensures that the best interests of our valued shareholders remain a top priority.\n\nCons of Dissolution and Redistribution:\n\nMissed Opportunities: The dissolution of the DAO may foreclose potential future projects and investments that could yield substantial returns when market conditions improve.\n\nDissolution Costs: There may be associated costs with the dissolution process, including legal expenses and fees related to contract audits.\n\nPotential Dissension: Not all shareholders may be in agreement with the dissolution and redistribution plan, which could lead to discord within our community.\n\nAcknowledging the Bear Market:\n\nIt is imperative to acknowledge and empathize with the adverse impact of the prolonged bear market on our performance. Like many in the cryptocurrency space,  Rari has faced substantial challenges that have affected the value of our assets and the viability of our projects. We must collectively consider the implications of these market conditions on our path forward.\n\nDissolution and Redistribution Plan:\n\nIn the event that shareholders decide to proceed with dissolution, we have formulated a transparent plan for the orderly distribution of treasury funds:\n\nShareholder Consensus: A majority vote of shareholders is required to approve the dissolution proposal.\n\nAsset Valuation: An impartial evaluation of assets and liabilities will be conducted to ascertain the value of the treasury funds.\n\nMethod of Distribution: Shareholders will have the option to receive their share in the form of cryptocurrency or other mutually agreed-upon assets.\n\nLegal Adherence: Legal experts will be engaged to ensure that the dissolution process complies with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nRole as a Member:\n\nAs a fellow member of  Rari, I have had the privilege of witnessing the dedication and unwavering commitment of our community members. I am well aware of the challenges we have faced due to the bear market, and I firmly believe that together, we can make informed decisions to navigate toward a more promising future.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nI implore all shareholders to take the time to thoroughly review this proposal and consider its ramifications for our shared journey. We shall convene a shareholder meeting to engage in discussions and cast votes on this proposal in future. Your active involvement is paramount, and I welcome any questions or concerns you may have. Please do not hesitate to reach out directly or through our communication channels.\n\nIn unity, we shall arrive at a well-considered decision that aligns with the best interests of our shareholders and paves the way for the future of  Rari. I extend my heartfelt gratitude for your enduring support and commitment to our community.\n\nWarm regards,",

      "content": "For whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing here regarding a marketing offer proposal. I am Marin and I am the content writer for GameFi Corner and have partnered up with a good friend of mine who has experience in marketing and e-commerce.\n\nGameFi Corner is a newsletter exclusively aimed at blockchain gaming and metaverse. We handpick the most up to date information and create content that is suitable and engaging to read.\n\nOur goal is to make GameFi a better place by making it accessible and educate everyone who is interested to make more informed decisions. We also want to collaborate with sponsors who believe in our development and positive future outcomes for everyone including the community, sponsors who partner up with us and GameFi Corner itself.\n\nWe see success when partnerships can truly benefit from one another like an interconnected chain. One provides with the sponsor, funding and in return we will contribute all our specific GameFi knowledge through extensive research and investment in paid advertisements so we can create traffic for both Rari Capital and GameFi Corner.\n\nWe will measure our success by analysing on how many users have clicked on your link / banner we will include in our texts. The more subscribers we can bring thanks to your potential funding, the more successful we will both become. Of course we are open to hear also other proposals on how we can benefit together.\n\nWe have just started writing for 1 and a half months and collected almost 200 organic subscribers but with paid marketing we plan to reach at least 5000 subscribers in a few months. My friend has many years of experience in affiliate marketing and e-commerce ads which gives us an additional confidence boost to reach our goal.\n\nLink to our project: https://gameficorner.substack.com/\n\nYours faithfully,\nMarin",

UMA community members would likely capitalize on the source of new yield. Last but not least, Rari would gain another respected contributing protocol.\n\nThe verification of Fuse Pool #128 would mark the first UMA use case and encourage future integrations.\n\nAdditional Information\nRiskLabs Treasury:\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xdD395050aC923466D3Fa97D41739a4ab6b49E9F5\n\nUMA Token Address:\nhttps://etherscan.io/token/0x04Fa0d235C4abf4BcF4787aF4CF447DE572eF828\n\nUMA OpenZeppelin Audits:\nhttps://docs.umaproject.org/oracle/known-issues#audit\n\nUMA Voting Portal:\nhttps://vote.umaproject.org/\n\nUMA Discord:\nhttps://discord.gg/vMCTmpEszR\n\nUMA website:\nhttps://umaproject.org/\n\nVote Details:\nVote yes to whitelist RiskLabs as an UMA Fuse Pool creator and verify Fuse Pool #128\n\nVote no if you disagree with Whitelisting RiskLabs.",

We sincerely hope this can put to rest the major disagreements that have been voiced to date, and allow both RGT & TRIBE communities to come together and support the broader vision for a synergistic ‚ÄúFei-Rari‚Äù combination.\n\n# Proposal\nChange Section VIII.

F of the merger proposal to reflect 7-day TWAP leading up to 11/16 deal announcement date (ethereum block 13582977 to 13628450):\n\nE.\n\n* RGT 7-day TWAP (ethereum block 13582977 to 13628450) is $41.0863 USD\n\n* TRIBE 7-day TWAP (ethereum block 13582977 to 13628450) is $1.2321 USD\n\n* Unadjusted Exchange Rate is calculated as 33.3465 TRIBE : 1 RGT\n\nF.\n\n* Adjusted RGT 7-day TWAP is defined as RGT 7-day TWAP adjusted down by the cost of REPT-b Repayment Obligations, equal to $41.0863 - $11,600,000/12,500,000 = $40.1583.\n\n* The final adjusted ‚ÄúExchange Rate\" is defined here as **32.5933 TRIBE : 1 RGT**, equal to Adjusted RGT 7-day TWAP divided by TRIBE 7-day TWAP.\n\n*While this will be a combined vote for convenience, RGT and TRIBE votes will also be tallied separately to get a better sense for each communities‚Äô penchant for this proposal*",

      "title": "Deploying Fuse technologies on the Fantom Opera Chain with Hector DAO",
      "content": "Hello Rari community. This is Prometheus, Co-Founder and Strategy Lead at Hector DAO.\n\nAfter agreeing a deal with the Rari Capital team, confirming the deal in a Hector DAO community vote, and finalising details, it is now my honour to seek the blessing of the Rari community in a final vote to implement our proposal.\n\nThe terms of the proposal are listed at the bottom of this post.\n\nThe following is excerpted and adapted from our original post on the Rari forums: https://forums.rari.capital/d/188-deploying-fuse-on-the-fantom-opera-chain-with-hector-dao\n\nI've removed a few paragraphs here to keep it concise. I recommend reading the original post in full.\n\nHector DAO is the largest rebase protocol on the Fantom network. Our market capitalisation is approximately $112,000,000, and we have $192,000,000 of value locked in our protocol. Here is a link to our DeFiLlama profile: https://defillama.com/protocol/hector-dao\n\nIn the month of November, we were the most traded project on the Fantom network, with a volume of $612,000,000, surpassing even SpookySwap - one of the main decentralised exchanges of the network. We employ a full-time team of 10+ developers and strategists which allows us to develop our project faster than any competitor on the chain.\n\nHector will integrate an open interest rate protocol that allows users to lend and borrow digital assets, all within the Hector Ecosystem. Lenders can achieve an attractive APY without any risk of volatility of the HEC price by lending out stable coins. Borrowers can use sHEC as a collateral to leverage their position or borrow stablecoins to use them in different projects without having to unstake sHEC. The benefit for the protocol is that the treasury collects fees, consisting of the difference between APR for borrowers and APY for lenders. This way, the treasury increases, which in return has a positive impact on Hector‚Äôs APY. The Lending and borrowing protocol will come with it‚Äôs own UI.\n\nCreating positive, impactful partnerships and relationships such as this are at the forefront of our priorities - cooperation is good for everyone. We want to contribute to the growth of the Fantom network. We focus on long-term growth and it is our stated aim to bring value to our users and investors in a reliable, responsible way. We aim to become a de facto financial centre within the Fantom chain.\n\nWe believe that future cooperation between Rari Capital and Hector is mutually beneficial and will align with the goals of both parties in a meaningful way.\n\nPrometheus,\nStrategy lead at Team HECDAO.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\nThe terms agreed upon between the Rari Capital and Hector DAO Teams are as follows:\n- $500,000 in HEC tokens to be vested to Rari Capital. The vesting schedule will monthly for a total of 6 months.\n- 30% of revenue from products on Hector Bank which use Fuse technologies to be given to Rari Capital\n\nIn exchange, Hector DAO will receive access to and support with the required Fuse contracts in order to develop part of the Hector Bank solution.\n\n",

      "title": "GFX Labs Compensation",
      "content": "Summary\n\nGFX Labs has provided services during the groundbreaking FEI RARI DAO merger, including smart contract creation and associated simulations & tests, solicitation of community input, and creation of a merger-plan in PDF format summarizing deal terms and conditions.\n\nGFX Labs‚Äô initially requested a payment amount equating to approximately 3.5 million USD, and has since re-proposed this with a timelock-vesting period of 2 years, linearly.\n\nThe terms proposed by GFX Labs have not achieved community consensus, but it is still necessary to come up with some amount of governance-agreed-upon compensation for the work provided - regardless and notwithstanding any potential future agreements to cooperate and work with the Tribe DAO.\n\nVote Calculations\n\nThe payout to GFX will be decided by this snapshot vote using a token-weighted sum to determine the final payout; the voting selection will include:\n\na. ‚ÄúNo Payment‚Äù\nb. 50k FEI\nc. 100k FEI\nd. 333k FEI\ne. 1M FEI\nf. 2M FEI\ng. 3.5M FEI\n\nThe resulting payment will be calculated as the dot-product of the total number of each votes for each option by the list of options:\n\na(0) + b(50,000) + c(100,000) + d(333,000) + e(1,000,000) + f(2,000,000) + g(3,500,000)\n\n(where a-g are the proportions of votes for each respective compensation option)\n\nAs a simple illustration of this formula, imagine a scenario with three potential vote amounts: A, B, and C. Take the case in which these options receive 10%, 40%, and 50% of the votes respectively; the final payout would be calculated as 0.1A + 0.4B + 0.5*C.\n\nThis vote will be posted to both the TRIBE and RARI snapshots. The votes on both snapshots will be totaled to compute the numbers and proportions above, using the conversion factor of 1 RGT = 26.7056734303 TRIBE listed in the terms of the merger. This is important so that both TRIBE and RARI holders can have say on the size of the payment.\n\nIf the ‚ÄúNo Payment‚Äù option receives more than 50% of the vote, then no payment will be given. Otherwise, ‚ÄúNo Payment‚Äù is equivalent to ‚Äú0‚Äù.\n\nScope and Execution\n\nPayment will be in FEI remitted from the Tribe Optimistic Approval multisig and is intended to be compensation for existing, completed work, and is not meant to be an indication of future collaboration. All additional compensation or long term arrangements between GFX and TRIBE are separate from this proposal.\n\nLinks\n\nAssociated Tribe Forum Post:\nhttps://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-xx-amended-fei-rari-merger-proposal-fip-xx-gfx-labs-compensation/3734\n\nAssociated Rari Forum Post:\nhttps://forums.rari.capital/d/186-amended-feirari-merger-proposal-gfx-labs-compensation\n\nOriginal GFX Labs Merger Proposal: https://gfxlabs.io/docs/draft_fei_rari_merger.pdf\n\nOriginal GFX Labs Smart Contract Code:\nhttps://github.com/code-423n4/2021-11-fei",

      "title": "Cross-chain deployment of Fuse Pool infrastructure with Midas Capital",
      "content": "### Intro\n\nAs extensively discussed with the Rari team and community, we'd like to propose the deployment of Fuse Pools on alternative L1s. The basis for the proposal has been discussed extensively in the Rari Forums [link](https://forums.rari.capital/d/179-deploying-rari-protocol-on-bsc-with-midas-capital/7), and consists of the following points:\n\n- Allocation of 25% of tokens to the Rari treasury\n\nWith the rest of the token allocation will be used for liquidity mining, team compensation, investors, marketing, treasury, etc.\n\n### Abstract\n\nThe Midas team plans on deploying the Fuse framework to BSC, and assuming community interest, as well on AVAX and Solana (via Neon Protocol).\n\nWith the goal of keeping incentives aligned with the Rari community, we commit ourselves to give back to the Rari project in the form of technical execution¬†and¬†protocol improvements, leveraging our combined extensive experience in traditional software development, web3 and tokenomics. \n\nPlease refer to the forum post for team background, and the specific initiatives we aim to target for continued engagement with the Rari community and project improvements. \n\n## Motivation\n\nOur team members are huge fans of the Fuse Pool architecture. We are convinced that permissionless lending pools are an essential DeFi building block. We want to use the opportunity and infrastructure that Rari has built and help push it further onto other chains, while actively contributing back to the main Rari codebase. We plan to work closely with the Rari team on further development/research initiatives.\n\nThe original forum post and comments contain more in depth information about our motivations around this project.\n\nWe want to thank the Rari community and the Core contributors for their continued support through this process!",

Recently an opportunity for PleasrDAO to be involved in the ConstitutionDAO whereby Pleasr could borrow against their $DOG holdings to help fund an assault on the constitution. PleasrDAO and $DOG Treasuries would then have a source of yield against their owned tokens. \n\nHaving the pool whitelisted would allow the $DOG community to call on liquidity available in DeFi to help fund these types of greater opportunity plays.\n\nFor - Whitelist DeFi Ted and the Dog Park (Pool #45).\n\nAgainst - Do nothing",

      "content": "### Summary:\nForum post[ here](https://forums.rari.capital/d/162-proposal-lusd-fuse-pool/2). The goal of this proposal is to create an LUSD Fuse Pool along with FEI, FRAX, DAI, and USDC.\n\n**We‚Äôd like the Rari Capital DAO to manage this pool**\n\n### Background:\nLiquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows users to draw interest-free loans against ETH as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD (a USD-pegged stablecoin) and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of 110%. Loans are secured by the Stability Pool, where users can deposit LUSD and provide up-front capital to offset uncollateralized debt. In return, they receive ETH collateral when liquidations occur and continuous LQTY rewards (our secondary token).\nLiquity is also governance-free and immutable with no admin keys. All operations are algorithmic and fully automated, and protocol parameters to maintain system health were set at time of contract deployment.\n\n### Contracts:\nLUSD Token Address: 0x5f98805a4e8be255a32880fdec7f6728c6568ba0\nChainlink LUSD Price Feed: 0x3D7aE7E594f2f2091Ad8798313450130d0Aba3a0\n\n### Initial pool parameters:\nUpgradeable: Yes\nClose Factor: 0.5\nLiquidation Incentive: 8%\nLUSD Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 75% / 10%\nFEI Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 75% / 10%\nFRAX Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 75% / 10%\nDAI Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 75% / 10%\nUSDC Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 75% / 10%\n\n### Motivation:\nCurrently, LUSD is not available for lending and borrowing on other money-markets. This creates a unique opportunity for Rari to be among the first, if not the first, to support LUSD.\n\n~$500M of the LUSD supply is in the Stability Pool, some of which Rari can capture and increase TVL. This is especially likely considering Rari usually boasts high APYs.",

      "title": "Infrastructure Task Force Grant Request",
      "content": "Hello Rari Capital DAO, this is on behalf of the whole infrastructure task force,\n\nSummary: \n\nAs previously announced (https://medium.com/rari-capital/the-roadmap-for-various-rari-capital-task-forces-716039e841ee) and (https://medium.com/rari-capital/version-2-the-future-of-the-rari-capital-dao-9d2c37027752), the Rari Capital DAO has migrated to a task force structure. This means that there will be several and hopefully many teams building the Rari Capital protocol as well as applications/integrations on top of the protocol. The goal for this DAO mechanism is to provide a conducive working environment where everyone who wants to get involved in supporting the DAO and protocol has the opportunity to. It is important that we have task forces designed to build and maintain the infrastructure, as well as task forces down the road that create applications to further inject the power of the protocol into new environments.\n\nBackground: \n\nUp until this new model was announced publicly, the founding team has been incentivized through the initial batch of RGT and newer contributors have gone ahead and created governance proposals requesting RGT from the treasury. Now that the most recent token mint has been passed and executed (https://www.withtally.com/governance/rari/proposal/4) , It is important that we now start to utilize these resources in order to retain all of the amazing talent we have brought to this organization. Retaining competent developers and on-boarding new talent will be integral to our success in the hyper-growing DeFi ecosystem. The market for top tier DeFi developers is becoming increasingly competitive and we need to make sure the Rari Capital DAO and infrastructure task force remain competitive in this space.\n\nAbstract: \n\nThe infrastructure team is the backbone of the Rari Capital Protocol. The members on this team vary from developers to business development to community management. This team of people have been tasked with building the most robust open interest rate protocol, Fuse, and all of the strategy and business operations surrounding it.\n\nThe infrastructure team would like to request the following from the community controlled DAO treasury for the next quarter (October 15th, 2021 to January 15th, 2022) in order to sustain current and new contributors financially. As Rari‚Äôs scope of product grows, we believe it is critical to build out the team across a few areas: UI/UX design, full-stack product engineering, DAO integrations, smart contracts engineering (solidity), and risk engineering (subgraph). This quarter we will be taking a very active approach to bringing on more full-time contributors.\n\nVesting Contract:\n100,000 RGT with (1, 4) vesting\n50,000 RGT [Fully liquid]\n\nMotivation: \n\nRari Capital has been live for over a year now, and it is clear that all of the contributors are committed for the long-term. We would like to be here forever and we need to ensure incentives are aligned between us and the community at large.\nHaving a strong relationship between the community and the contributors is the most important in an industry like this, and we urge everyone to share their thoughts and comments below to ensure that we all work together in crafting the best proposal possible. This will set a foundation and template for future task forces. Thank you.\n\nFor: Provide the infrastructure team with incentives mentioned above.\nAgainst: Do not do anything.",

      "content": "Forum post: https://forums.rari.capital/d/129-nexus-mutual-shield-mining\n\nSummary\nThe following proposal is geared towards the Nexus Mutual Shield Mining program and how Rari Capital (RGT) would be incorporated.\n\nBackground\n\nRari Capital has surpassed $600M in TVL and security will always remain the top priority. Since the exploit on May 8th, we have adjusted our security standards such as: removing external integrations, retainer program with Quantstamp, and exploring insurance mechanisms. I believe strongly in insuring Smart Contracts, and after a long conversation with the Nexus Mutual team, I am confident in this potential partnership.\n\nAbstract\nThe protocol already has an insurance mechanism on Cover, but there are no rewards, making it very unappealing to users. From anecdotal evidence, it is very clear that our community and protocol wants insurance, and Nexus Mutual can support us.\n\nIf this proposal passes successfully, we will work with the Nexus Mutual team to create and deploy a shield mining program for coverage on their platform.\n\nMotivation\nHow Nexus Mutual Coverage and Shield Mining works.\n\nOn top of risk assessors earning NXM for staking on Rari Capital smart contract coverage, they can earn $RGT through the proposed shield mining program. To incentivize our shield mining program I propose we allocate up to 5,000 $RGT tokens. The goal is to optimize for a reward rate of 2.5% (0.05 RGT/NXM staked), which at 100k NXM staked would yield about 12 weeks of campaign length if we were to distribute 5,000 $RGT. The 2.5% is on a weekly basis, so would be 100% annualized for protection against the Rari Capital Protocol.\n\nFor: Engage in Shield Mining using RGT\nAgainst: Don't do anything",

      "title": "Whitelist Debt DAO as a pool creator",
      "content": "Summary:\nWe are proposing to be whitelisted so we can create a new Fuse pool for Debt DAO to deploy with USDC, and DAI as the base tokens. This pool will serve as the main liquidity pool for our DAO debt service.\n\nBackground:\nDebt DAO is looking to hook DAOs on debt. We believe that the DAO ecosystem currently could benefit greatly from the introduction of uncollateralized loans in order to fund growth-stage DAOs. Only when there is a protocol hack do DAOs begin to explore debt financing, but we believe that the lower cost of debt should be used by early-stage DAOs during their growth phase, allowing many more avenues for innovation, growth, and funding of operations with little or no dilution of the community of token holders.\n\nThe average liquidity mining program will cost a DAO millions of dollars. While somewhat useful as a token distribution mechanism, they are usually using it to sell equity in order to buy liquidity. Taking a loan, even at 15% APY, to provide liquidity directly from their treasury would cost orders of magnitude less and the DAO retains upside in the success of their product. We expect this to drive high utilization and APY for our Debt pool and give depositors some of the highest returns in any lending markets, all backed by the DAO economy.\n\nWe already have a short list of several mid to large cap DAOs that we have been in discussions with that are potentially interested in taking on these loans.\n\nAbstract:\nWe want to launch a USDC + DAI Fuse pool to serve as the liquidity source for our Debt service. We are interested in having anyone being able to supply liquidity and borrow against collateral like other Fuse Pools, while allowing Debt DAO to whitelist DAOs that undergo our due diligence process as zero-collateral borrowers.\n\nThe members of Debt DAO originally met through Llama DAO, the treasury management and account service DAO. We will be leveraging our knowledge/connections to do credit analysis and due diligence on DAOs who apply to our service, while conducting ongoing analysis on the deployment of borrowed funds.\n\nInitial pool parameters (subject to to change):\n\nUpgradeable: Yes\nClose Factor: 50%\nLiquidation Incentive: 8%\n\nPrimary assets for DAOs to borrow\nUSDC Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 90% / 5%\nDAI Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 90% / 5%\n\nRisks:\nAs an uncollateralized pool defaults can lead to potential losses to liquidity suppliers of their capital and accrued interest. Centralized stablecoins could be subject to regulatory scrutiny as well as censorship of the accounts that interact with the fuse pool.\n\nOur whitelisting process will be public and auditable so lenders can withdraw funds if they do not agree with Debt DAOs decision\n\nMembers of Debt DAO will be providing $50k of initial capital to seed the pool so our funds will be at risk with everyone else's.\n\nRelevant Links:\nOne Pager: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Keb73wgkGq-NrAr4erEHrLt0UPtKxdknmfblmOfODbo/edit?usp=sharing\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/debitors\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7eEkdNcR9G\nMultisig address: 0xA097856Ef35D368184DE4c3771E7F363B5Cb01E5\n\nPros: We‚Äôre looking to add an Arbitrum component that utilizes Nova, and the creation of this Fuse pool will potentially be a way for Rari to test Nova in production.\n\nCons: None\n\n",

      "content": "### Summary\n\nWe propose the MaskDAO to be whitelisted as a pool creator. The initial collateral assets for the pool will include $MASK(our governance token), DPI‚Ä® (DeFi Pulse Index), USDC, DAI and ETH. In the future, we are also open to either add $MASK in other pools or add other collateral assets in the pool we are going to create.\n\n### Background\n\nMask Network is the core product of Dimension, which is positioned to become the bridge that connects internet users from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. The foundational technology of Mask Network is a peer-to-peer encrypted messaging application, with new functions continuously being created around this foundation. We have integrated decentralized social messaging, borderless payment network, and decentralized file storage and sharing to provide a safe and convenient portal for users to jump right into the continent of decentralized finance and then the new world of Web 3.0.\n\n $MASK is the native token of MaskDAO. The DAO is the owner of the Mask Ecosystem. $MASK holders are members of MaskDAO and possess ownership of the Mask Ecosystem through the DAO. As the native token, $MASK serves as incentives to facilitate governance. Each $MASK represents one vote. Overtime, Mask Network team and ecosystem members will develop more products and services that would accrue value to $MASK. Mask Network will continue to actively engage with top Web 3.0 and DeFi projects as we have done with MetaMask, Mirror, UniSwap, Pancakeswap, Transak, Coinmarketcap etc to expand use cases for $MASK.\n\n### Market Statistics & Info\n\n- $MASK contract address: 0x69af81e73a73b40adf4f3d4223cd9b1ece623074\n- [CoinGecko token link](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mask-network) \n- [Etherscan token link](https://etherscan.io/token/0x69af81e73a73b40adf4f3d4223cd9b1ece623074#balances)\n- Links to Dex liquidity pools\n  - [Sushiswap](https://analytics.sushi.com/tokens/0x69af81e73a73b40adf4f3d4223cd9b1ece623074)\n  - [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/info/token/0x2ed9a5c8c13b93955103b9a7c167b67ef4d568a3)\n  - [Quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/quick/0x2B9E7ccDF0F4e5B24757c1E1a80e311E34Cb10c7/0x2791Bca1f2de4661ED88A30C99A7a9449Aa84174/0xDEb69421fc2FbA0c3b4F8b1ae291029f7CCa344E) \n- Available on Binance, OKEx, Huobi, Coinbase, Digifinex and other 30+ CEXs\n\n### Motivation\n\n- As of Sep 9 2021, according to Coingecko $MASK market cap is $256,171,314 and average 24hrs trading volume YTD is $66,719,022 with nearly 66 thousand holders. Having $MASK Fuse Pool will will increase Fuse's TVL and increase the utility of collateral assets in the pool.\n\n- MASK Network has an active community with more than 41 thousand followers on Twitter that will be happy to support Fuse by promoting and marketing the utility of $MASK as a collateral on Fuse on social media.\n\n- Recently, Mask Network has started the Social DeFi Alliance with 15 founding partners from DeFi Apps, ecosystem partners, and community & media partners. In the future, we will launch more social DeFi projects for social network users, promote the connection between Web2.0 and Web3.0, guide more top Internet social platform users to access DeFi, and, for the long term, we are dedicated to promoting the large-scale application of Web3.0. We would love to explore the possibility of ecosystem cooperation and integration with Fuse in the future.\n\n### Audit report\n\n[SECBIT](https://pxmcr6lqb3qzyfb7hybmvw5wzm4p5it2seyzl5prgfxlblttjsua.arweave.net/fdgo-XAO4ZwUPz4Cytu2yzj-onqRMZX18TFusK5zTKg) (Feb 22, 2021)\n\n### Links\n\n- [Official Website](https://mask.io/)\n- [Github](https://github.com/DimensionDev)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/realmaskbook) \n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/masknetwork)\n- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/cKGW45g)\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/maskbook_group#telegram)\n\n### Address for pool creation: \n[0xEC6bAf1fBb865Fd3Ff3FC83A7B5262003D9ba8bE\n](https://etherscan.io/address/0xEC6bAf1fBb865Fd3Ff3FC83A7B5262003D9ba8bE)\n\n### The Vote: \nVote Yes, to whitelist MaskDAO as Fuse pool creators\n\nVote No, to do nothing.",

      "title": "Whitelist Float Protocol as Fuse Pool Creators",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nWhitelist Float Protocol as Fuse Pool Creators\n\nIf passed, this proposal will enable Float Protocol to create Fuse pools that utilise FLOAT and/or BANK as collateral. Fuse would be the first platform to support borrowing and lending of FLOAT and BANK.\n\nThe Whitelisted address with control would be the operations Multisig: [0x383dF49ad1f0219759a46399fE33Cb7A63cd051c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x383dF49ad1f0219759a46399fE33Cb7A63cd051c)\n\n## Background\n\nFloat Protocol is building the decentralised monetary system of the future. At the heart of it is the FLOAT token, a low-volatility floating currency for web3 - `#DeFiMoney`. FLOAT tracks a Basket of crypto assets rather than chasing a dollar peg. The price of FLOAT is stabilised by regular profitable Dutch Auctions which expand and contract the supply of FLOAT as necessary. This leads to a low-volatility stable currency, making it the perfect collateral while still being capital efficient. But, it also gives the user a currency that protects their digital purchasing power and an escape from the great monetary inflation of fiat currencies and dollar-pegged stablecoins. BANK is a utility and governance token of Float Protocol. BANK captures the volatility of FLOAT, as well as capturing any speculative demand. In return, it supports the price of FLOAT in times of reduced demand. The initial supply of BANK was issued by a democratic launch designed to achieve wide distribution across different crypto communities and to incentivise ownership by users who are active participants in other decentralised protocols. Any excess demand for FLOAT and the Basket of crypto assets to overflow is used to burn BANK.\n\n## Contracts and price feeds\n\nBANK: Float Protocol: [BANK Token | 0x24A6A37576377F63f194Caa5F518a60f45b42921](https://etherscan.io/address/0x24A6A37576377F63f194Caa5F518a60f45b42921) \nFLOAT: Float Protocol: [FLOAT Token | 0xb05097849bca421a3f51b249ba6cca4af4b97cb9 ](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb05097849bca421a3f51b249ba6cca4af4b97cb9)\n\nFLOAT Price Feed: FLOAT-USDC low-fee pool on Uniswap v3 TWAP\nBank Price Feed: BANK-ETH Sushiswap TWAP\n\n## Initial pool parameters\n\nInitially Float Protocol would consider the following upgradable pools that will support FLOAT and BANK token consisting of: FLOAT, BANK, ETH, DAI, USDC. Example pool parameters would be:\n\nUpgradeable: Yes\nClose Factor: 50%\nLiquidation Incentive: 15%\nFLOAT Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 60% / 10%\nBANK Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 60% / 10%\nETH Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 60% / 10%\nUSDC Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 60% / 10%\nDAI Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 60% / 10%\n\nFloat Protocol would be willing to explore the use of asset caps on Rari Fuse as an additional measure to maintain liquidity on DEXs. Additionally, Float Protocol would look to have FLOAT integrated with other pools such as Olympus DAO‚Äôs Pool Party following [Olympus DAO‚Äôs community call](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BCn_GfOzdg) on Thursday July 29 at 10PM UTC (6p ET, 3p PT) alongside Rari Capital, Fei Labs, Alchemix and Reflexer.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe unique selling point of having Float Protocol on Fuse is that FLOAT is excellent collateral. FLOAT has the characteristics of a stablecoin with some market trailing trends. This would mean less liquidations while still being capital efficient. A purely novel offering in DeFi allowing those to borrow and lend with currency that tracks the economy in which they carry out their DeFi activities. Users can put dollar pegged stable coins regulatory fears on hold as they would have the opportunity to get access to truly decentralised and low-volatility capital. BANK offers the other side of the same coin, giving borrowers and lenders the opportunity to take advantage of its volatility relative to FLOAT if they so please.\n\nFollowing on from Community requests and expressions, this would be the first lending platform of BANK and FLOAT which combined have a market cap of ~$30M, access to lending will only increase both the market cap and trading volume of both FLOAT and BANK. Furthermore, fellow FLOATers and BANKsters would be attracted to Rari Fuse as the initial primary lending platform for FLOAT and BANK\n\n## Risks\n\nAs FLOAT is a low market cap currency at the time of writing, price feed risk is the main risk. Large movements in the market could lead to TWAP price feeds becoming stale very quickly. However as one would expect liquidity increase with the introduction of a lending pool this price feed risk should reduce over time. Moreover, Dutch Auctions of the Protocol can be increased in frequency giving arbitrageurs more opportunity to level out any large price deltas in a profitable manner.\n\n## Links\n\nWebsite: https://floatprotocol.com/ \nBackup site: https://ipfs.io/ipns/floatprotocol.eth/#/pools \nLitepaper: https://observablehq.com/collection/@floatcoder/float-protocol-litepaper \nMedium: https://medium.com/@floatprotocol \nDiscord: https://discord.gg/nVCZacJJqM \nTelegram: https://t.me/officialfloatprotocol \nTelegram (‰∏≠Êñá): https://t.me/floatprotocolCHN \nAnalytics: https://duneanalytics.com/Float/Float-Protocol \nDocs: https://docs-float.gitbook.io/docs/ \nGithub: https://github.com/FloatProtocol/ \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FloatProtocol \nForum: https://forum.floatprotocol.com/ \nGovernance: https://snapshot.org/#/snapshot.floatprotocol.eth \n\n## The Vote\n\nVote Yes, to whitelist Float Protocol as Fuse pool creators (managed by the Float Protocol operations multisig [0x383dF49ad1f0219759a46399fE33Cb7A63cd051c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x383dF49ad1f0219759a46399fE33Cb7A63cd051c)).\n\nVote No, to do nothing.",

Gelato will actively promote the pool as the preeminent borrowing option for G-UNI LPs.\n\nThis proposal will increase utility of G-UNI, drive TVL to Rari Fuse, and generate more fees for the Rari DAO.\n\nBackground:\nThe Gelato Network is a general automation framework powering a decentralized network of bots that executes smart contract functions on behalf of protocols and users. One of Gelato's flagship products, G-UNI, allows for users to provide liquidity to Uniswap v3 in a manner where positions are fungible and easy to manage. \n\nProposal:\nWe propose the Gelato Network to be whitelisted as pool creators in order to create a new Fuse pool with G-UNI LP tokens as collateral assets. The pool will be upgradable and initial collateral assets will include G-UNI DAI/USDC, G-UNI USDC/USDT, G-UNI DAI/USDT, USDC, USDT, DAI. \n\nMore Information:\nhttps://forums.rari.capital/d/149-create-new-fuse-pool-for-g-uni-tokens\n\nVote Details:\nFOR: Whitelist Gelato Team (Multisig: 0xed5cf41b0fd6a3c564c17ee34d9d26eafc30619b) as pool creator on the Rari Fuse platform.\n\nAgainst: Do nothing.",

      "content": "Forum post: https://forums.rari.capital/d/147-nftx-vaults-as-collateral-proposal\n\n**Summary:**\nAfter deeper discussions with the Rari team, the NFTX core team would like to formally propose creating a new Fuse pool with PUNK, GLYPH, ETH, and DAI. The advised collateral factor for this proposal is set to 50%. All tokens can be lent and borrowed, enabling users of Fuse to long/short prime NFT categories. As all NFTX Vault tokens are provided on Sushi, a SushiSwap TWAP bot is set up that updates every 15 minutes by the NFTX Core team, with a redundancy bot, kept up in case of failure.\n\n**Abstract:**\nCreate pool with\nPUNK (CF = 50%)\nGLYPH (CF = 50%)\nETH (CF = 50%)\nDAI (CF = 50%)\n\n**Motivation:**\nHaving a Fuse NFT liquidity pool (powered by NFTX vaults) available gives users the ability to use (fractions of) their NFTs as collateral for borrowing/lending markets, as well as generate additional yield from potential liquidations. This brings a new ecosystem of users (NFT holders) to the Rari protocol while adding additional value to NFTX users allowing them to do more with their NFTs. \n\n**Side note:**\nThe current selection of NFTX Vault tokens is based on a combination of TVL and the amount of NFTs per vault. \n\nFor a full overview on NFTX TVL, we have set up a Dune Analytics here: https://dune.xyz/nftx/NFTX-Dune-Dashboard-Protocol-View \n\n**For:** Create this Fuse pool\n**Against:** Do not create this Fuse pool",

May or may not includes include gauges, profit-sharing, hack victim compensation and so on. All subject to future discussion and DAO appoval.\n\n## Background\n\nTokenomic structure decided in October 2020\n1.25M RGT under [2 year vesting for founding members](https://medium.com/rari-capital/an-updated-take-on-vesting-8b3aa8c3a902)\n8.75M RGT used for aggressive liquidity mining campaign soon after the launch of Rari, has long completed, currently all owned by community\n\nRIP-1 proposed in December 2020\n[Link to RIP-1](https://vote.rari.capital/#/rari/proposal/QmU3334PXSAGd3kiSZo4FZkKPpNL5qvHiNwRZVTKkcCvv9)\nMints 10M RGT\nGot voted on but never executed\n\nNew discussion started over RIP-1 in August 2021\n[Sustaining the DAO long-term](https://forums.rari.capital/d/134-sustaining-the-dao-long-term)\nReceived valuable community feedback\n\nThis proposal being posted today. Intent to finalise ASAP.\n\n## Abstract\n\nMostly covered in _Summary_\n\n## Motivation\n\n#### Motivation 1\n\nWe wish to aggressively expand and gain more full-time as well as part-time contributors. We have gained a number of contributors now who are being paid on salaried or grant basis from a rapidly diminishing treasury. Transitioning any of them into full-time roles requires vested RGT allocation. **This is urgent to avoid losing any of these members.**\n\n#### Motivation 2\n\nWe do not wish to do multiple mints as that leads to uncertainty in the minds of RGT investors. We'd rather formalise one clear long-term RGT tokenomic plan. What we can have is multiple allocation votes and decisions over already minted RGT - as new contributors are onboarded and new projects (taskforces) are spawned off the Rari Capital DAO\n\n#### Motivation 3\n\nWe wish to do liquidity mining, however have not finalised the liquidity mining plan today. Once finalised we wish to automate it on-chain as much as possible to avoid uncertainty and human discretion (after it is approved). We also don't yet have audited code for the long-term inflation or specific liquidity mining plans. This will take 1-2 months.",

This resulted in the creation of [Fuse Pool #24, Harvest FARMstead](https://app.rari.capital/fuse/pool/24).\n\nHarvest FARMstead has quickly grown to be the 6th-largest pool on Fuse.  This growth has been accelerated by [bootstrapping incentives provided by Harvest to USDC depositors](https://harvest.finance) and a Harvest community member's creation and deployment of an innovative [new stablecoin interest rate model](https://etherscan.io/address/0xab0f8Cd18E875AF7F2718B394Ccd1a5a0643D8a9) (and [associated PR](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/rari-dApp/pull/447) to support IRMs with adjustable parameters).\n\nHarvest would like to show appreciation to RGT holders by providing access to stablecoin borrowing enabled by Harvest's deposit bootstrapping and the new IRM.  In exchange, Harvest requests a reduction in the Pool #24 platform fee from the 10% to a partnership discount of 7%.  Increased pool usage and collaboration on further Fuse improvements will more than make up for this fee decrease.\n\n[See the discussion in the forum ‚Üí](https://forums.rari.capital/d/142-add-rgt-to-pool-24-reduce-pool-24-platform-fee)\n\n## Vote Details\n\nFOR: Add RGT as collateral in Pool #24 @ 60% LTV and reduce the Fuse platform fee in Pool #24 from 10% to 7%\n\nAGAINST: do nothing",

It also offers various products such as a tokenised Savings account which has traditionally yielded between 10%-30% APY consistently without token incentives, mainly through swaps on its platform and lending.\n\nRari has been a great partner and has funneled users' capital into mStable Save through its¬†**[Stable Pool](https://app.rari.capital/pools/usdc)**, and has also included mStable's native token MTA in¬†**[Fuse Pool 2](https://app.rari.capital/fuse/pool/2)**. We believe there is potential to expand this collaboration with Rari, and bring higher capital efficiency to underlying assets with inbuilt diversification.\n\nIntegration with other protocols is an expanding focus of mStable, and hence, we would like to propose to whitelist the mStableDAO as a Pool Creator for Fuse to introduce an isolated lending market for its assets.\n\n### Motivation\n\nWe would love to initiate a further collaboration with Rari as a long-term funnel of deposits into mStable Save and interest from the community, as well as pave the way for further interactions together.\n\nmStable's assets have the potential to be more capital efficient without significantly taking on more risk, thus providing an excellent market fit for Rari Fuse Pools.\n\n### Implementation\n\nThis pool will be unique as it will be an isolated lending pool focusing on mStable assets (mAssets), which are highly robust and stable, as they are fully backed (1:1) by underlying assets on-chain. Users can redeem mAssets for underlying assets at any time and do not rely on token incentives to back their mAssets, making them highly anti-fragile in both bull and bear markets.\n\nBorrowing against mAssets is akin to borrowing a weighted basket of underlying assets.\n\nmStable's interest-bearing assets (imAssets) have similar properties and have traditionally offered better yields - close to 3x higher - compared to cTokens and aTokens with diversification properties that some users have been keen on, e.g. censorship resistance, governance failure, peg failure.\n\n### **Vote Details**\n\n**FOR:**¬†Whitelist the mStable ProtocolDAO Multisig (0xF6FF1F7FCEB2cE6d26687EaaB5988b445d0b94a2) as a pool creator on the Rari Fuse platform.\n\n**AGAINST:**¬†do nothing.\n\n### Further Information\n\n[Link to Forum Post](https://forums.rari.capital/d/81-add-mstable-musdimusdmbtcimbtc-fuse-pool)\n",

      "title": "Allowlist BarnBridge as a Fuse Pool Creator",
      "content": "**Summary**\nIf passed, the BarnBridge DAO would be allowlisted as a Fuse Pool creator. The BarnBridge DAO would focus on bootstrapping pools for its derivative ERC-20 assets from both SMART Yield (e.g., junior tranche tokens) and SMART Alpha (e.g., junior as well as senior tokens).\n\nBarnBridge's market capitalization oscillates between $75M and $125M, while its SMART Yield product has once reached a high-water mark of $299M in TVL. SMART Alpha, an application for calibrating exposure to asset price volatility of any ERC-20, will launch by mid-September. \n\nYou can learn more about us here:\n- [App Homepage](https://app.barnbridge.com)\n- [Dune Dashboard for SMART Yield](https://duneanalytics.com/0xBoxer/Barnbridge-or-Smart-Yield)\n- [Dune Dashboard for BarnBridge Governance](https://dune.xyz/0xBoxer/barnbridge)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/barn_bridge) \n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/barnbridge)\n\n**Background**\nBarnBridge is a risk tokenization protocol for DeFi. Its applications allow users to select from opposing pools, referred to as tranches, and take positions on risk factors like interest rates or asset prices. Its first application, SMART Yield, offers fixed and levered variable yields on stablecoins deposited into underlying lending markets like Aave, Compound, and C.R.E.A.M. Finance. Its application suite has expanded to include SMART Exposure, a position rebalancing solution, as well as SMART Alpha soon, which will allow users to calibrate their exposure to price movements in an underlying digital asset. BarnBridge is currently live on Ethereum and the Polygon Network.\n\n**Motivation**\nWe've been considering Fuse Pools for a while but have held off to date due to a) lack of secondary liquidity for our SY jTokens, and b) competition from our own rewards pools for those jTokens. Now that those jTokens rewards lapse on August 8th and Aavegeddon is behind us, the time is ripe to take the plunge.\n\n*We would look to roll out two fuse pools over multiple phases.*\n\nPhases 1 and 2 would center on the creation of what will become the SMART Yield pool, pending the provisioning of liquid Uniswap v3 pools for jTokens for appropriate liquidity and price feeds.\n\n- **Phase 1:** BOND/USDC/ETH\n\n- **Phase 2:** BOND/USDC/ETH/bb_cDAI/bb_cUSDC/bb_cUSDT/bb_aDAI/bb_aUSDC/bb_aUSDT/etc.\n\nPhase 3 would center on the creation of the SMART Alpha pool. SMART Alpha will allow users to seed pools for a given ERC-20 with a junior and senior side, offering exposure to levered and dampened asset price volatility depending on the ratio between the two sides. It's set to launch by mid-September. As we get liquid secondary pools for these perpetual senERC-20 and junERC-20 tokens, they would be added here.\n\n- **Phase 3:** BOND/USDC/senETH/junETH/senWBTC/junWBTC/etc.\n\n**Potential Benefits**\nThere are three prongs along which the BarnBridge <> Rari partnership could prove fruitful.\n\n- **SMART Alpha Assets:** SMART Alpha senior tokens give up relative upside in order to receive absolute downside protection. This makes the SA senior versions of any ERC-20 a compelling collateral type. A BarnBridge Fuse pool will make it straightforward to showcase the pristine nature of these derivative assets, rather than having to argue in theory with the governance of other platforms. Note, these senior tokens will need to achieve appropriate secondary liquidity of their own for liquidation to be possible.\n\n- **BarnBridge DAO Assets:** The BarnBridge DAO currently holds a third of BOND token supply. Access to a credit line through a Fuse Pool could be compelling for that reason alone, but the DAO will accrue fees over time that it could leverage here as well.\n\n- **SMART Yield Junior Tokens:** Junior tokens provide users with levered exposure to underlying interest rates in the stablecoins they deposit. While these are not secured positions, given that they are responsible for paying the yields of senior pool depositors on the other side, adding additional utility through a Fuse pool could make users more comfortable in participating with their capital.\n\n**Vote Details**\n- **FOR:** Whitelist the BarnBridge core team multisig as a pool creator on the Rari Fuse platform.\n- **AGAINST:** Do nothing",

In order to encourage further growth and lower borrow rates for RAI and FRAX, we propose that the RAI & FRAX collateral factors and the interest rate models should be updated.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal presents new parameters for the RAI and FRAX stable assets in Fuse Pool 9. These new parameters are meant to lower borrow rates for both assets and attract more capital.

After sufficient period of time (say 1 month), support for oracles or contracts can be discontinued.\n\nMotivation\n\nAssets in pool 0 and 1 are included in various other pools. Pool 2 has a vast number of assets - firstly this makes setting parameters more difficult. Secondly and more importantly, such broad-based pools have been unable to take off without official support from either those communities or official deposits or incentives.\n\nRemoving these pools with reduce clutter and redundancy. We can still try getting TVL for these assets in other pools with support from respective communities in a more organic way.\n\n",

      "content": "**Summary:**\n\nWhitelist Stake DAO as Fuse pool creators.\n\nIf passed, this proposal will enable the creation of Fuse pools that utilise Stake DAO assets (SDT, xSDT and/or Proof of Deposit/Delegation tokens) as collateral. If passed, Fuse would be the first platform to support SDT and other Stake DAO yield-bearing assets.\n\nPresently SDT (Stake DAO Token) has a market cap of $20m and over $90m in strategy deposits on Ethereum; Stake DAO assets such as SDT and Proof of Deposit tokens e.g. sdEursCrv will be used to create Fuse pools. Further details on the benefits of integrating our two protocols are in the #motivation section.\n\nStake DAO References\nLink to project: Stakedao.org\nSDT token: 0x73968b9a57c6e53d41345fd57a6e6ae27d6cdb2f\nxSDT token: 0xaC14864ce5A98aF3248Ffbf549441b04421247D3\nStake DAO Governance forum: https://gov.stakedao.org/\nDocumentation: Medium\nSocials: Twitter, Telegram\nWhitepaper: refer to Stake DAO‚Äôs medium.\nInsurance: All funds deposited into Stake DAO smart contracts can be insured through Nexus Mutual for material loss of funds due to smart contract bugs. There has never been any loss of funds.\n\n**Background:**\n\nStake DAO is a multichain DeFi protocol that brings cutting-edge strategies, cross-chain interoperability, and smarter staking all under one roof. Built by some of the contributors behind Curve Finance and other leading DeFi protocols. Stake DAO now hosts more than $160 million (TVL) across Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, and validators for for PoS assets such as Cosmos, Solana, and Tezos. We are committed to onboarding new users into DeFi through initiatives such as academy.stakedao.org as well as several B2B partnerships in DeFi with protocols such as Frax and partnerships with firms such as Swisborg.\n\nStake DAO token (SDT) is the governance token for the Stake DAO protocol. Currently, SDT is not on any major lending market in which SDT and other synthetic assets could be used as collateral to borrow other tokens. Stake DAO‚Äôs initial Fuse pool would create the first liquid lending market for SDT in a lower/average risk Fuse pool, giving SDT holders the ability to borrow against SDT This is an important function for the SDT token, enabling Stake DAO users to hold SDT and remain invested in the project‚Äôs long-term success while enjoying the ability to leverage/hedge.\n\nCurrently, SDT has three use cases:\n\n1) Governance.\n\n2) Staking SDT in the Sanctuary smart contract. This enables The Herd (Stake DAO‚Äôs community) to earn a share of protocol revenues from DAO activities (Strategies, SaaS and NFTs). Depositors receive xSDT for SDT deposits and protocol fees are distributed in SDT.\n\n3) Deposit xSDT into the Palace to mine Points for Stake DAO NFTs that unlock special features within the broader Stake DAO ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal would enable the creation of a lending market for SDT, enabling the Herd to borrow against their SDT to hedge or leverage.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nFor Rari, whitelisting Stake DAO as a pool creator would directly:\n\n1) Increase protocol utilization and fee revenue for Rari through 2 main funnels.\n\n1.1 Native SDT and xSDT deposits into Fuse.\n\nWith a Market cap of ~$20m as the first protocol to list SDT as collateral, Fuse would be able to receive these SDT in deposits.\n\n1.2 LP token deposits.\n\nWhen users deposit into Stake DAO strategies, they receive a Proof of Deposit token representing a claim on their deposited capital. Fuse pools for these tokens should drive a significant volume of deposits into Fuse.\n\nCurrently, Stake DAO has >$90m in strategy deposits on Ethereum; Proof of Deposit tokens from these strategies could be used in the lending markets provided through Fuse.\n\n2) Heighten exposure for Fuse and thereby the Rari protocol.\n\nAs the only live lending market for SDT (at time of writing), our community of 10,000+ users would actively utilise and drive attention to Rari. We have a community that would appreciate the utility of borrowing against their SDT tokens. The benefits here are too numerous to state, so in summary, this will directly lead to organic growth for both protocols.\n\n3) Provide a solid foundation for future collaboration.\n\nStake DAO will work closely with Rari to bolster a symbiotic relationship between the two protocols by utilising Stake DAO assets as collateral for future pools. These tokens fit well in Fuse‚Äôs value proposition as these synthetic assets are considered long-tail assets. Stake DAO will also consider other future pools, for instance, a Fuse pool to deposit some portion of treasury assets. Any future events will be subject to the approval of Stake DAO community governance.\n\nGiven the level of deposits that Stake DAO can drive to Fuse and in line with the recently passed proposal from Fei protocol, we propose reducing the protocol fee to 6% for 6 months (we can see where we stand and reassess then), provided that we supply a minimum liquidity of $10 million. This would also enable us to more easily pass this through Stake DAO community governance.\n\nThe benefits of this would be:\n\n  Continuously aid in securing the pool's current assets.\n    Align incentives so that increases in scale result in higher efficiency.\n    Passively fund security analysis/upgrades (as well as access to our smart contract team, as demonstrated previously by Julien B).\n    Passively fund upgrades that directly benefit both platforms.\n\n**Vote Details**\n\n**FOR:** Whitelist the Stake DAO Multisig (0xF930EBBd05eF8b25B1797b9b2109DDC9B0d43063) as a pool creator on the Rari Fuse platform.\n\n**AGAINST:** do nothing.\n\nForum post for discussion: https://forums.rari.capital/d/130-whitelist-stake-dao-as-fuse-pool-creators\n\n",

I specialise in 2D illustration. I mostly do character designs but recently I began to focus on illustrations that aim to bring classical art back into the modern time. I am heavily influenced and inspired by ancient art, philosophy, modern comics, Japanese modern and ancient art, spirituality.\nI would describe my art style as focused on dark outlines with powerful, bold colours. It has a sombre feel to it, inspired by gothic art and ambience and aims to be impactful while also communicate the emotion behind it.\nI recently became inspired by the surge in NFT popularity and have started posting and selling my works on Makersplace.\n\nPlease find a link to my gallery on ArtStation: https://www.artstation.com/derectumart\nAnd my gallery on Makersplace for a collection of NFTs: https://makersplace.com/derectum/\n\nSpecification\n\nI propose to work closely with the DAO for the creation of a unique artwork.\nThe Rari brand is inspired by cars, specifically Ferrari. Ferrari is associated with fast cars and sleek, sharp curves and style. Within their modern designs, especially, Ferrari prides itself in its artistic style. In the words of their chief design officer, Flavio Manzoni, their aim was: ‚Äúto combine art and science. There is a very close relationship between form and content, between the external surface and internal components.‚Äù\nDesign is not the only element of this brand, however. Speed is what matters. Fast cars, fast technology, faster than before. Fast and modern. Rari works within the emergent crypto market. You take pride in being precursors of a new future based on this new technology and the speed with which it strides forward.\nWithin art, speed and the excitement of new technology has been represented by Futurism.\n\nA few words on Futurism\nFuturism was an artistic and cultural time in Italy (which is no coincidence, I believe, since Ferrari is an Italian brand). It explored the idea of speed, it embraced a time of innovation and great technological advancement. Their art reflected a modern way of life, detached from the past.\n\nMy proposal involves the resurrection and re-interpretation of one particular art piece, namely ‚ÄúDynamism of a Car‚Äù by Luigi Russolo (1913). I propose to create a unique artwork inspired by this piece. I think this painting reflects very well the ideas behind the Rari brand. Speed, here, is literally created through the brush strokes.\nThe Rari brand elements will also be incorporated within the artwork.\nMy own style is very close to this. If you explore a few of my most recent works in my gallery, you‚Äôll find a few re-interpretations of ancient works, re-created within a personal and modern style (eg. A.Mantegna‚Äôs Amore and Psyche).\nI aim to do the same with the painting described above.\nThe artwork will be created as both a .png file and it will be sent as an NFT in whatever format is requested.\n(PNG is the safest file format for digital art and its size is very small)\n\nCommunication\nI suggest a communication between me and the original creators of the Rari brand for the incorporation of necessary design elements. Shapes, colours or branding elements can be incorporated within the artwork.\n\nTimeline\nFrom whenever this proposal is accepted I would require 10 days to complete the project. This would involve a communication with the people at Rari involved in the design and any changes required I will try to implement within that time-frame. However, if there is a massive discrepancy between my original idea and your own vision, then I propose we discuss the addition of a few days.\n\nPayment\n500USD or equivalent.\nArtists like me thrive only on networking and connections. If satisfied with my work (and my work-ethic!), I could use your recommendation outside of this channel!\n\nThank you!\n",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nEnable Harvest Finance to create a Fuse pool for borrowing against Harvest assets.  Harvest will promote Fuse as the premier way to borrow against Harvest assets and will provide incentives to bootstrap the Harvest Fuse pool as-needed.\n\nThis proposal will improve capital efficiency for Harvest asset holders, drive TVL to Rari Fuse, and generate more fees for the Rari DAO.\n\n## Background\n\nHarvest is a yield aggregator with operations primarily based on Ethereum.  Harvest saves users time and money by finding and vetting farming opportunities, batching transactions, and automatically compounding returns on over $300mm in deposits across a wide range of assets.  Fees from vault profits are shared with FARM holders who deposit into the iFARM profitsharing vault.  Learn more at https://harvest.finance \n\nThe most-requested feature from FARM holders is the ability to borrow against their holdings, improving the capital efficiency of holding FARM.  Rari Fuse is the perfect platform for creating and managing a money market for this purpose.\n\nMoney markets are often challenged by a cold-start problem of building enough borrowable deposits to kickstart usage.  Harvest has deep experience in incentive bootstrapping and liquidity management and will work with FARM holders, the Harvest treasury, and yield-seeking depositors to bootstrap the Harvest lending pool.  Harvest will collect feedback on Fuse from users and community contributors and provide this feedback to Rari for discussion and consideration.\n\n## Vote Details\n\nFOR: allowlist the Harvest Community DAO Multisig (0xF49440C1F012d041802b25A73e5B0B9166a75c02) as a pool creator on the Rari Fuse platform.\n\nAGAINST: do nothing.\n\nForum post for discussion: https://forums.rari.capital/d/127-allowlist-harvest-on-fuse",

I've worked in the customer support field for many years for a wide range of companies, so I know how to handle stressful situations while guiding the customer into a satisfactory solution. I think this treat could be helpful for a role such as a forum MOD, and even though I'm not a dev, I love learning and talking to friends about the intricacies of code, the innovation of different assets and protocols, and how the markets work.\n\nRegarding the Translation offering, I have previously worked as a legal/technical translator for CaixaBank, one of the largest banks in Spain. My duties were, among others, to translate legal documentation and mediate between payment processors with chargeback claims.\n\nWorth to mention, you can see a brief example of the work I do as a Translator. I contributed to the UI translation of the website, https://www.xrptipbot.com/.\n\nTo wrap things up, here's a briefing of my application:\n\nQualities:\n\nCustomer support, handling stress situations and answering to complicated questions is my day to day.\nLanguage: Native Spanish, English advanced, German basic, Italian Basic.\nMedium understanding across different digital assets and the protocols behind.\nEmpathic, patient, people‚Äôs person.\nTasks:\n\nOnboarding Spanish DeFi users across different channels (Twitter, Discord, Chat groups, Forums etc.).\nModeration of the Spanish community in Discord (Chat Etiquette, resolution of questions, guidance to relevant information, basic technical explanations.)\nComplete translation of UI for https://rari.capital/\nConditions for MOD:\n\nTrial period: 1 month.\nWorking hours: 40h / Week.\nSalary: 1500 USDC or RGT equivalent per month.\nDuration: Ideally 6 months to a Year.\nConditions for UI Translation:\n\nOne-Time Translation.\nOpen end, estimated completion two weeks.\n500 USDC or RGT equivalent.\nOptionally to be a recursive task, maintenance and updates.\nPretty much, that is, I am really looking forward to positive feedback and hopefully the beginning of my journey with Rari's Team!",

      "content": "# Summary\nThis DAO-to-DAO proposal is to create a new FUSE pool that is managed through the existing Vesper DAO governance structure. The Vesper DAO will use this Fuse pool as its primary lending platform, selecting the tokens (via Vesper gov) based on the needs and wants of the Vesper community.\n\n# Background:\n## What is Vesper?\nVesper Finance is a DeFi ecosystem and growth engine for crypto assets, providing a suite of yield-generating products focused on accessibility, optimization, and longevity. Vesper is dedicated to creating and supporting the conditions for DeFi‚Äôs expansion and success, to the benefit of all participants.\n\nToday, Vesper operates as a yield meta-aggregator for top crypto assets (ETH, USDC, WBTC, LINK, DAI, USDT, UNI). Users can deposit these assets to Vesper and enjoy auto-compounding returns as their funds are routed to the best yield opportunities in the space.\n\n## What are we hoping to accomplish?\nVesper seeks a well-written, well known, audited lending platform to serve its community.\n\n# Abstract:\nWe propose the creation of a new FUSE Vesper pool to allow borrowing / lending of various DeFi assets including the Vesper tokens, managed by Vesper governance. Vesper governance v1 is a Gnosis Safe 0x9520b477Aa81180E6DdC006Fc09Fb6d3eb4e807A, with a progressive decentralization transitioning to Compound-forked governor, governed by the VVSP token.\n\nHere is an example of the parameters for the pool we will set, once whitelisted as pool mgmt:\n\n* Upgradeable: Yes\n* Liquidation Incentive: 8%\n* Close Factor: 50%\n* Platform Fee: 10%\n\nAnd initial assets:\n\n* ETH (Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor): 65% / 20%\n* wBTC (Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor): 65% / 20%\n* USDC (Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor): 75% / 15%\n* DAI (Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor): 75% / 15%\n* VUSD (Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor): 75% / 15%\n* VSP (Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor): 60% / 20%\n* vVSP (Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor): 60% / 20%\n* MET (Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor): 70% / 20%\n# Motivations:\n\n* DeFi: Orchestrate a DAO-to-DAO proposal and arrangement.\n* DeFi: Become part of the ‚Äòseasoning‚Äù process for new, high quality tokens.\n* Vesper: To collateralize project tokens VSP and VVSP, similar to SUSHI/XSUSHI. This collateralization via Fuse pool provides a key alternative for Vesper users, versus swapping the VSP token to meet capital needs.\n* Vesper: Vesper‚Äôs Grow pools - aka yield vaults - are hungry for additional yield sources. This Fuse pool will add additional yield sources.\n* Vesper: New project tokens that lack yield sources can be evaluated and listed through Vesper‚Äôs governance process. This, in turn, creates yield sources for Vesper‚Äôs pools.\n* Rari: Vesper users can bring TVL and traffic through strong demand to collateralize their VSP or VVSP tokens.\n* Rari: Vesper can bring TVL simply by doing its job - seeking additional yield sources for Vesper‚Äôs pools.\n* Rari: Vesper can on-board new project tokens in a risk-adjusted manner. This creates a sandbox that trials tokens for listing in other Fuse pools.\n## Vesper Market Statistics & Info:\nAs of 7/5/21\n\n* TVL: ~$460M\n* Market Cap: $32.5M\n* Circulating Supply: 4,187,684VSP\n## Community:\n* Telegram: 4,155\n* Discord: 650\n* Twitter: 16,500\n\nToken Supply Documentation: https://docs.vesper.finance/\n\n# Forum Post\n\nLink: https://forums.rari.capital/d/123-whitelist-vesper-dao-as-fuse-pool-creators-managers\n\n# Vote Details\n**For**: Whitelist Vesper team member EOA 0xf4087b7AB24Bde9c445ddD0bc4DF257F81277214, which will create a new Vesper Fuse Pool, then transfer management to Vesper Pool Ops (0x9520b477Aa81180E6DdC006Fc09Fb6d3eb4e807A).\n\n**Against**: Do Nothing\n\n",

Quantstamp has just completed an audit on our version of Compound Finance‚Äôs Governor Bravo. We are now ready to begin the first step of the migration process, and we will be starting with: yield aggregator smart contracts, treasury requests, and the RGT token. If you would like to learn more about the system, you can find more information here: https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/42\n\nOnce we have more security audits and infrastructure work complete within the codebase, the multi-sig will be transferring ownership of the Fuse codebase to on-chain governance. The Fuse smart contracts have been audited several times now, but for extra security during our continued safeguarded launch, we will continue using Snapshot for updates/upgrades as an intermediary step before fully transitioning to on-chain governance in the future (follow up proposal).\n\n**Background**\nAll governance vote signals are currently done through Snapshot and then executed by the multi-sig members if approved.\n\n**Abstract**\nIf this proposal passes, the multi-sig members will transfer off ownership of the yield aggregator, RGT token, and treasury to all of the RGT holders.\n\nFrom this point forward, all smart contract upgrades to the yield aggregator, treasury requests, and deployments will all be handled through Governor Bravo on-chain system following a successful signal from Snapshot.\n\n**Motivation**\nMigrating to on-chain governance will fully decentralize the Rari Capital protocol and community.\n\n**For:** Start migration to on-chain governance\n**Against:** Don't do anything and keep multi-sig",

      "content": "Summary:\nThis proposal aims to unlock the OHM pool to unlimited deposits from the yield aggregator, completely based on APY of the pool. This would be for Dai and USDC.\n\nBackground:\nOHM pool deposits were enabled by a previous governance proposal (https://forums.rari.capital/d/107-kickstart-new-fuse-pools-using-usdc-and-dai-yield-pools) that enabled for proactive deposits up to $100k in new pools. The OHM pool has been a great success, garnering up to more than $15m in deposits and quickly became the second largest pool. However, we are limited in the amount of capital we can pour into it from the yield aggregator because of the previous proposal. This proposal aims to lift that limit.\n\nAbstract:\nI propose that we enable the OHM pool to be treated like all of the other pools (see here for a previous example of this: https://forums.rari.capital/d/55-add-fuse-pools-as-yield-aggregator-strategy). The yield aggregator will rebalance in and out of this pool purely based on APY from both the USDC and Dai pool.\n\nThe protocol would be taking on the risk of the Olympus asset and the Olympus policy team. If the Olympus asset somehow broke, it would likely result in funds lost here. The Olympus policy team could also adjust pool parameters to something that would be sub-optimal. However after in-depth review, it seems that these risks are unlikely to be major blockers.\n\nMotivation:\nThis would enable super high APY's on both USDC and Dai when enabled (each 17.5% and 20% respectively at the time of writing). Additionally, it would give the Ohmies more assets to be able to borrow against.\n\nFor: Initiate plan described above\nAgainst: Deny",

These use cases generate borrowing pressure.\n**Lending side**: the Idle community is eager to have more composability features, and the lending primitive is the first one. Depositing $IDLE to get stablecoins would allow users to increase the capital efficiency, depositing the loan in Idle protocol to earn more $IDLE from strategies. This mechanism creates a win-win loop for both Idle and Fuse.\n->Governance is discussing and preparing the next steps regarding Treasury diversification; thus, having $IDLE as collateral on Fuse would allow Governance to consider stablecoin loans.\n**DAO2DAO relationship**: Idle protocol recently launched the idleRAI pool. More than ~50% of the funds are deployed into Fuse, representing ~60% of the Fuse RAI liquidity and ~8% of the whole Fuse TVL. The listing of $IDLE would create a more solid bridge between the two communities.\n \n \n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Add IDLE as a collateral asset on the Fuse Pool #3\n**AGAINST**: Do nothing\n ",

      "content": "## Summary \n\nWhitelist Cartesian's pool (Pool 15) with current parameters for unrestricted deposits from the yield agg, assuming highest rates\n\n## Background\n\nCartesian (https://twitter.com/cartesian99) is a DeFi power user who wishes to borrow stablecoins against their MKR and UNI with higher collateral factors than those supported by Aave or elsewhere. Expected deposit amount is 1250 MKR and 50,000 UNI ($3.9m approx) and expected borrow is $1.5m. Cartesian is willing to pay higher rates than the current yield being earned by the yield agg, which is approximately 12-13%.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWhitelist the pool for yield agg to deposit.\n\nCurrent pool parameters are 75% CF, 0% RF for all assets, and 10% liquidation incentive.\nAll assets use Chainlink oracles. Chainlink oracles publish price movements in excess of 1% almost instantaneously, this makes 75% CF quite safe for these assets.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis will enable our yield agg to provide more competitive yield to its users. It will also showcase the functionality of using the yield agg to bootstrap new pools and provide power users with large amounts of capital. This could set a precendent and lead to even more competitive and favourable deals by power users who want access to the yield agg's capital.\n",

      "content": "FORUM DISCUSSION\nhttps://forums.rari.capital/d/108-concept-and-implementation-proposal-fuji-borrowing-aggregator-for-fuse\n\nSUMMARY\nFujiDAO proposes to develop a dedicated borrowing aggregator that will serve exclusively Fuse pools. Rari's users will be able to borrow specific assets at the best rate available across selected pools.\n\nWe are ready to invest significant efforts and human resources to build this integration and we apply for a Rari Capital DAO grant to partially fund its two initial stages.\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nWe built the first borrowing aggregator which aims to optimize loan expenses for DeFi users. The protocol achieves this by constantly monitoring borrow markets and whenever there is a better rate, it automatically refinances the whole pool of debt with a flashloan.\n\nWe create vaults where users deposit a single asset as collateral and borrow against it another asset. For example, in the ETH/DAI vault, users deposit ETH and borrow DAI. Thus, isolating debt positions allows for better risk management and the most effective interest rate optimizations.\n\nWhen users borrow from a Fuji vault, the needed liquidity gets sourced directly from the base protocol proposing the best rate. When market conditions change and there's a provider with a lower borrow rate for a certain asset, the protocol triggers a rebalance operation and refinances the whole position of the vault. In that way, users instantaneously get a better rate on their loans without the need to take any action on their side.\n\nMOTIVATION\nRari Fuse is a set of Compound-like pools that offers a big choice of assets and a horizontal diversification of risk. It gives a great flexibility for creation of highly customizable pools but this comes at the cost of fragmenting liquidity. That‚Äôs why, we believe we can answer to some extent to this challenge by plugging Fuji‚Äôs vaults engine and thus forming the vertical axis of Fuse markets.\n\nADDITIONAL DETAILS\nThe proposed work requires good coordination from both sides and we suggest going step-by-step by establishing milestones and regularly evaluating them.\n\nStage 1:\n- creation of Fuji instance: smart contracts, refinance bot\n- aggregation of one pair across two pools: ETH as collateral, DAI as borrow asset\n- Rari's dev team validates what's already done in order to continue to stage 2\n- timeline: 2-3 weeks\n\nStage 2:\n- aggregation of two more pairs across two/three pools\n- liquidation bot\n- timeline: 2-3 weeks\n\nGRANT\n6000 USDC or RGT equivalent due after successful completion of stage 2\n\nVOTING\n- For:\nApprove development of Fuji borrowing aggregator for Fuse pools.\n- Against:\nReject development of Fuji borrowing aggregator for Fuse pools.",

      "title": "Whitelist Yam Dao as Fuse Pool Creators",
      "content": "**Summary:**\n\nWhitelisting Yam Dao as Fuse pool creators. \n\nGovernance permitting, Yam‚Äôs initial Fuse pool would be set up with the goal of creating the first liquid lending market for Yam token holders in a lower/average risk Fuse pool. Yam Dao will provide liquidity from its treasury to bootstrap the pool (a governance vote will take place post whitelisting).\n\nIn the future as Yam‚Äôs familiarity with the Fuse ecosystem grows, the Dao will work closely with Rari to consider adding its synthetic asset collection and their respective LP tokens as collateral for future pools. These tokens fit well in Fuse‚Äôs value proposition as these synthetic assets are considered a long-tail asset. The Dao will also consider additional future pools, such as one that can be used to deposit some portion of treasury assets.\n\n**Background:**\n\nYam token holders need a lending market in which YAM can be used as collateral to borrow other tokens. Yam community members may want to temporarily hedge their Yam as opposed to just selling it, but this is also not possible without an active lending market. Thirdly, this pool will generate interest on Yam which could benefit the community members/Yam treasury by allowing idle yam to become yield bearing.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nWhitelisting Yam as a pool creator will increase protocol utilization and fee revenue for Rari. Yam will actively support and promote this Fuse Pool as the go to location to borrow against Yam tokens, which will also create additional visibility for Fuse. \n\nOn top of this, creation of a Yam owned Fused pool offers a great service to the Yam community by increasing Yam token utility. This is likely to form the foundation of a good relationship between Dao‚Äôs and provide the base on which future long tail assets can be added to additional pools further driving up Fuse utilization.\n\n**Forum Discussion Additions:**\n\n[Link to forum post](https://forums.rari.capital/d/104-whitelist-yam-dao-as-pool-creators)\n\nJai makes a strong point in response to a community member‚Äôs ideas pertaining to Fuse pool fee sharing: ‚ÄúBy having both of the fees {Rari admin fee & Dao admin fee} add up to the 10% static, it ensures that this pool has a moat and nobody can just spin up their own with the same assets and draw all the liquidity their way.‚Äù\n\nFor this snapshot, we propose that for the initial Fuse pool the 10% admin fee be split 8% to Rari and 2% to Yam treasury. Although it‚Äôs likely that this initial Fuse pool will not generate considerable revenue for either protocol at this stage, it is suggested in principle to align incentives, solidify a cross Dao partnership and a proof of concept of a liquidity moat (see forum post for more info). With this sharing arrangement, Yam can set the pool creator fee to 0% and have a competitive advantage on future pool creators that try to siphon liquidity away with a 0% fee pool.\n\nIt is likely optimal to have a fee sharing arrangement that scales with TVL, as it allows those protocols that bring in more Fuse revenue a greater share of that revenue. But as this does not exist at this point the initial static 8%/2% split has been proposed for the initial Yam Dao Fuse pool. Yam Dao‚Äôs future pool deployments will abide by Rari‚Äôs future TVL based sliding fee sharing scales if they are to be implemented. \n",

      "content": "# Summary\nI, Zane St. John, propose to work for the Rari Capital DAO on a trial basis of one week to build out an interest-rate comparison feature in the Rari dApp. 60 RGT will be provided as compensation.\n\n## Background\nI've been programming since my father introduced me to BASIC when I was six years old. In elementary school, I gradually taught myself JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, tools that would allow me to progress to where I am today.\n\nI met Jai on the school bus in 2016, but our business relationship began in 2018, when I did some work on a product-management dashboard for internal use. Later that year, Jai invited me to work at Ambo as the lead frontend web developer. Both of these opportunities provided me with experience and expertise necessary for development at Rari.\n\nHere is a list of some of my recent work:\n- [**Ambo**](https://ambo.io/) - Ambo, founded by Jai Bhavnani and Jack Lipstone, is an app designed to make it simple for laymen to invest in cryptocurrency. The project was acquired in January 2019 by [MyCrypto](https://www.mycrypto.com/). At Ambo, I worked as the lead frontend web developer. In that role, I created frontend interfaces and connected them to the Ethereum network using web3.js.\n- [**Schoop**](https://blog.schoop.app/) - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, I created an app for students at my school to organize their virtual learning schedules. Students can input their classes and Zoom links, and they can see the schedule for each day in a clean user interface. Schedules can also be emailed if students opt in. Currently, over 20% of the student body is registed on Schoop. I'm currently building v2 of the app, which uses Firebase and React to improve user experience and reduce operation costs.\n- **Themus** - Last summer, I participated in the LaunchX entrepreneurship program, which groups young entrepreneurs to create \"startups\" in a six-week period. My group created Themus, a service that uses artificial intelligence to analyze product reviews to help consumers find the best products for their needs. In my role, I built a demo analyzer tool using Next.js and Firebase, and I devised a method to spin up temporary GCP instances for AI sentiment analysis.\n\nI have also taken several computer science courses at school, such as AP Computer Science A and Honors Advanced Topics in Computer Science, which have improved my understanding of computers as well as my code. Because I have now exhausted my school's computer science offerings, I will be taking two [Global Online Academy](https://globalonlineacademy.org/) courses next year‚Äîone in cybersecurity and another in data science.\n\nIf you'd like more information about my experience, you can also [view my resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ztlT51bJYLCDn6xVKGDdUuTP0Xx9FHPA/view?usp=sharing). And if you're more technically inclined, you might also wish to [see my GitHub](https://github.com/zane-programs).\n\n## Abstract\nI propose to work for the DAO to build an interest-rate comparison view, implementing designs made by Jai Bhavnani. [Here's a rough prototype with mocked data](https://gfycat.com/frayedjitterykite).\n\nThis development will take place over a trial period of 1 week for a payment of 60 RGT, subject to DAO approval.\n\nCompletion leads to the potential of full-time conversion.\n\n## Motivation\nCreating a view to compare interest rates across Aave, Compound Finance, and Fuse pools will allow users to make informed decisions about where they lend and borrow their assets at any given time, thereby optimizing the use of their assets.\n\n# Voting\n\n## For\nApprove creation of the interest rate comparison view.\n\n## Against\nReject creation of the interest rate comparison view.",

The team behind Rake Capital has its background in product development, management and crypto.\nThe Rake team has been in contact with members of the Rari team to discuss such a clone.\n\nAbstract\nThe proposal is as follows:\n50% of Rake tokens will be held by Rari DAO. The other 50% will be utilized to create an autonomous and independent entity called Rake Capital, with its own community, roadmap and governance.\nThe first product to be brought to the Polygon-clone is the Fuse Protocol, with other products being deployed over time. Further, Rake will make considerable changes to the UI (simplify the product), explore new use-cases by being built on Polygon and improve the core-functionality of the Fuse protocol.\nAlso Rake will craft educational content, marketing material and growth strategies for increasing the amount of pool creators and the locked liquidity.\nThe Rake team will work closely with the core Rari team for developing the technical roadmap, knowledge transfer and collaboration on growth-efforts (which has already been started).\n\nMotivation\nLeverage Polygon's infrastructure to realize the full potential of Fuse protocol.\nUnlocking massive value for both Rari DAO and Rake Capital via increased number of pools and absorbing a significant portion of locked liquidity in Polygon ecosystem.\nThe Polygon Clone may become a venture for developing new exotic DeFi products.",

USDC and DAI pools have earned decent yields, however they would benefit if new yield sources were generated.\n\n## Abstract\n\nNew Fuse pools face a chicken-and-egg problem where users want to lend USDC or DAI into new pools only when there's already yield (and therefore borrow demand) available. And users want to deposit collateral and borrow USDC or DAI only if those stablecoins are already available to borrow in the pool. Using the yield aggregator to deposit these stables will enable kickstart activity in these pools.\n\n## Motivation\n\nKickstarting activity in new Fuse pools has obviously beneficial short-term outcomes for Fuse pool users and Rari Capital. It also has beneficial medium and long-term outcomes for the USDC and DAI pools - as this new activity bootstrapped in turn generates yield that will be exclusively available to them and the Fuse pools, which could potentially be in excess of the yield that was otherwise being earned.\n\nPicking only pools less than 3 months old with low TVL ensures that the pools selected deserve this proactive deposit.",

While a structured way of computing an asset's historical safety is being implemented, the release of concentrated liquidity in Uniswapv3 changes and complexifies how liquidations can be tested in the RSS framework.\n\nAlthough I‚Äôm coming from outside DeFi, I‚Äôm able to bring my existing skills to this project as I further learn solidity and the layer2 ecosystem üòÄ",

      "title": "Concept Proposal: Create a grant to finish Fuse contract documentation",
      "content": "## Summary:  \n\n### Background \nAlthough there is extensive documentation on how to interact with fuse pools/comptrollers, there is little on the fuse pool lens and safe liquidator. I spent a long time reading through ABI JSON viewers and calling all the functions to fully understand what values returned would suit my projects best. I'm sure more important developers, especially ones working for other protocols, would benefit greatly from clear documentation.\n\n### Abstract \nCreating a grant to solve this would allow for the community to collaborate on who tackles the issue. The financial incentive absolutely needs to exist first, in order for us to have an engaging conversation on this ~~somewhat~~ boring, yet essential subject that is **documentation**.  \n\n### Motivation \nAt first the data structures returned from the fuse contracts are very confusing, but when laid out clearly, make perfect sense. Having documentation for the liquidator, and more importantly fuse pool lens, can save _hours_ from people building with Rari. This is especially true for those unfamiliar with the ecosystem such as developers from other protocols. An added benefit to this faster building, is fewer miscommunications.  This is why detailed, yet clear documentation is an incredibly important part of any DAO and cannot go overlooked. I intend on applying for this grant if it's approved, but I hope to have some competition so we can drive the bar even higher!\n\n[->This<-](https://github.com/jbenus/rari-docs-proposal/blob/main/README.md) mockup I made shows how the docs should be in accordance with the appearance of the [current](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/docs/tree/main/src/fuse#redeem) ones. \n\n### Payment\nThe payment should be between``$200-$500``in USDC or RGT. I think anyone applying for this grant should propose a fee in this range and tokens (or leave it to the DAO to decide _;)_ ).",

      "content": "Summary:\nRemove yield pool funds from the yield pool strategies (currently Aave and mStable) and hold them in the yield pool contracts to remove the current 0.5% withdrawal fee.\n\nBackground:\nAs we transition to the USDC and DAI earn pools (instead of stable and yield), the yield pool must be depreciated. However, the yield pool currently has a 0.5% withdrawal fee (this fee is required to prevent arbitrage within this pool since it maintains various stablecoins that can have minor price fluctuations). Ultimately, if we ask for users to withdraw their funds, they may be unfairly impacted by this fee, especially if they first deposited into the pool recently.\n\nAbstract:\nIf passed, the yield pool will no longer earn interest on deposits, but the withdrawal fee will be lifted and users will have more freedom to withdraw. This should also reduce gas fees when withdrawing from the pool (no longer required to pay for gas to withdraw from each strategy).\n\nMotivation:\nImprove user experience during the transition from the yield pool.\n\nFor: Remove yield pool funds from strategies and lift the 0.5% withdrawal fee\nAgainst: Do not remove yield pool funds from strategies and maintain the 0.5% withdrawal fee",

For example let's say uni swap has $1 mil of liquidity for some asset, and we have $1.5 mil of assets in the Fuse pool\n\nAbstract : I have implemented a mapping, that stores the Max Asset Cap for each asset. A fuse Pool admin or Asset Cap Guardian can set up this value.\n\nMotivation : A Maximum asset cap would help to fix the maximum amount of asset that can be deposited in the Fuse Pool. It will prevent improper liquidiations for every asset deposited in the Fuse Pool\n\nSolution Proposed : https://github.com/Rari-Capital/compound-protocol/pull/1\n\nI am Aditya Dhir, a computer Science and Engineering Student.

      "content": "I'm requesting approval to work for the Rari Capital DAO, specifically to complete one of the approved grants of Batch 1: Self-made frontend.\n\nDesign\n\nHere's an interactive prototype:\n\nhttps://www.figma.com/proto/x1sE2cuSzV9e1645pQADTv/Untitled?node-id=1%3A4&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1&hide-ui=1\n\nIcons would be designed to match the logo's vibe, and there's some animations and on hover details that are still missing.\n\nBackground\n\nI'm a self-taught full stack developer.\n\nI stumbled upon the crypto art community in twitter really early in 2020 that led me to discover Bitcoin and Ethereum and I fell down the rabbit hole - partly because its super interesting to try to understand the gigabrains in their twitter threads, and partly because I fell in love with its potential to change almost every aspect of human organization and interaction.\n\nAt the time, I was working a part-time shift which left me with enough time to study and research. DeFi was getting really big, and I wanted to be a part of that so I started learning web development. That was around last June and it was a little hard and slow at first because of my job, but then on February of this year I was able to start freelancing as a web developer and have been doing that since then.\n\nI don't have any experience with DeFi projects yet, but I'm actively looking to contribute and build a reputation in the space. I have experience with:\n\nReact\nNodejs\nJavascript\nTypescript\nExpress, Apollo Server\nDocker\nKubernetes\nNginx\nSolidity\nMongo DB\nSQL\nAnd I love UX/UI design.\n\nSpecifications\n\nDuring development, the code would be available in a public GitHub repo - that way my progress is trackable and completely transparent at all times. The platform would be developed with React and Typescript, and hosted in fleek/IPFS to ensure censorship resistance and integrity of the audited source code.\n\nIf there are any features that you'd like included please submit a proposal so that the Rari community can vote and discuss e.g. graphs that should be implemented, info that you would like displayed in the layout. The idea is to develop a seamless user experience for the Rari yield/fuse pools.\n\nI would also provide continuous support and feature integration for the project after its been delivered. \n\n\nPayment\n\n3500 USDT and an additional 500$ worth of RGT. Payment release would be requested upon completion of the work, after code is audited by the Rari Team.\n\nTimeline\n\nThe platform would be delivered by the 15th of July with a 4 day delay at most. I'm asking for an extended amount of time to ensure the highest quality.",

      "title": "Reimbursement - Final Plan (Re)",
      "content": "Reimbursement - Final reimbursement steps\n\nSummary:\nThis vote's goal is to counter vote the previous one that decided (pretty much undemocratically and out of the blue) that reimbursement will be in DAI over a period of 4 years.\n\nContext:\nRari Capital exposed on their website an ETH pool that clearly says: \"safe returns for ETH\". Meaning they took all the necessary precaution to make the pool risk free.\nThings cannot always go smoothly and a hacked occurred. No one could have predicted that and that's okay.\nNow, the team as repeated endlessly that they would worked hard to (and I quote this sentence) \"make everyone whole\". \nThey also said that they would take this matter very seriously and in a matter of 2 days - even with unanswered questions (and still unanswered) about the vote and nature of the bonds on the forum - they pushed a vote that was ending 48 hours after.\nAnd I'll finally mention that there IS NOT a single person in the #solution channel on discord that wants to see the protocol reimbursement in neither DAI nor a 4 years timeframe. Both non-hacked and hacked people don't want that. \n\nSide note:\n257.7k RGT voted for a pass the stick strategy, meaning ETH for the hacked people + quick reimbursement.\n195.4k RGT voted for the package A (75% of which being 2 addresses), meaning DAI for the hacked people + \"whole\" in 4 years.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is starting to look bad for Rari. First I'm assuming that the team didn't vote. So we can consider that they either dont care or are fine with the output of the previous vote. They keep saying that they are just \"user\" of the platform and not in control of it BUT they don't vote. Or, gain, they were fine with the output of the previous vote.\nAnd on the assumption that they did vote, for package A, cause i'm assuming that they hold more than 30k of RGT - bigger voter of Package D got 28k RGT -, well that's even worst. Building a product, failing to make it safe and failing to make the hacked people whole. Man this doesn't look good and anyone with a good bag of RGT should be concerned about this.\nIn addition, if they fail to properly handle the loss of 10 millions of $, I don't want to imagine how will they treat bigger issues. \n\nBottom line:\nAt this day, the hack hasn't been taken seriously enough. Hacked people hasn't been taken seriously either. I'm all for Rari success but this doesn't look good if we reimburse hacked people in DAI over a 4 years time in such a fast paced environment. We are taking our own users for fools and that's not right. Blockchain should and need to be the next step to make the world a better place and that's not the right path.\n\nThis vote is assuming 2 things:\n- Reimbursement of 100% of lost funds (Previously voted).\n- Reimbursement in ETH (Most important thing).\n\nI see 4 kind of possibility:\n\n1 - Pass the Stick:\nCommunity member, Ben, has taken the lead on potentially developing a community multi-sig. This would be an additional DAO in addition to the one that is currently running. This option would delegate X $RGT (X=decided by governance later) to this multi-sig who is able to negotiate deals on the protocols behalf. Ben has already gotten 0xMaki, Anthony Sassano, Mariano.eth, CMS Holdings, Darren and Daryl Lau and Ric Burton on the multi-sig.\n\nTraditional Bonds:\n\n2 - Traditional Bonds, package A:\nPayment denomination: ETH\nPayment interval: Quarterly\nMulti-bond structure: Yes\n\n- 1 small bond, reimburses small holders (defined as <=5 ETH in balance at the time of the hack, total bond amount equal to >160 ETH, ETH equivalent at time of exploit) in a 9 month bond.\n- 1 normal bond with everything else that‚Äôs already defined in a 4 years bond.\n\n3 - Traditional Bonds, Package B:\nPayment denomination: ETH\nPayment interval: Quarterly\nMulti-bond structure: No\nMaturity date: 4 years\n\n4 - Don't change anything.",

      "content": "# Summary\nI, platocrat, propose to work for the Rari Capital DAO to implement user analytics for Rari's Fuse pools for payment of 2500 USDC and $2500 worth of RGT.\nImplementation deadline is July 1st, with a 4-day grace period.\n\n# Background\nI'm a dropout from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\nI majored in psychology but took a bunch of courses that interested me, including:\n\n- 2 graduate-level statistics-for-psych courses,\n- 2 graduate-level risk management courses (risk mgmt. for financial institutions, and commodity and currency risk management),\n- applied cryptography,\n- computer science for statistics,\n- options & commodities,\n- options (finance) course,\n- international macro & forecasting,\n- basic statistics\n\nWith my psych and analytical background demonstrated above, I can bring a strong analytical mind to this task in terms of analysis of assets and risk-focused metric design around user behavior.\n\nI can also code in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Solidity, but tbh, I'm no wizard-like Ben or Jet üòÖ .\n\nRecently, I've been interning at OptimismPBC since March 16th with the initial role of leading developer experience and community engagement. Although, I ended up trying to help wherever I could. This led me from expanding Optimism's documentation to being the primary point-of-contact for hackers during the Scaling Ethereum hackathon, where I directly helped debug issues with hackers' projects and helped to raise and triage new issues with our stack on GitHub. From the experience I gained from the hackathon, I occasionally helped ChainLink and Synthetix with issues in their integration tests. I also generally helped with smaller GitHub issues and have been the primary Discord support person since I joined Optimism üôÇ.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/platocrat\nGitHub: https://github.com/platocrat\n\n# Spec of work\nI propose to work for the DAO to help with the following work:\n\nCreate and use advanced metrics to build visualizations (in grafana or a d3 library) of user behaviour such as mean/median loan duration in various pools/assets, mean/median profit or loss for users in various pools/assets, graphs for correlation between market leverage / rates and market prices of assets, average wealth of user - fish or whale, other protocols used by most common Fuse users, and so on, return rates for users who make losses or encounter ‚Äúbad‚Äù Fuse pool behaviour. More/different/custom metrics will be used (tbd.) that are tailored to better understanding users of Fuse pools.\n\nMetrics not pre-defined here will be listed in an additional section at the bottom of this proposal.\n\nI will consult with @t11s to learn the proper calls to the fuse pool contracts.\nI will also consult with the team on ways to improve Fuse in light of this data.\nI am also willing to provide continuous support/development for the visualizations I create.\n\n# Timeline\nFrom whenever this proposal is accepted until July 1st, with a 4-day delay, at most.\n\n# Payment\n2500 USDC and $2500 worth of RGT",

There is lots of room for creativity in pool creation. Various synthetics and derivatives can be listed, oracles and time periods can be modified, and pools can be marketed in interesting ways.\n\n### Motivation\nAllowing individual users to experiment fast without requiring DAO approval for each listing will enable Rari to identify product-market fit faster and gauge what kinds of listing are beneficial.\n\nThe current approach has been to establish contact with teams of projects whose tokens are to be listed, this however slows down the pace at which listing occurs. Not all projects have the attention span required to undertake pool creation with us. It is therefore a more scalable model for Rari to undertake this pool creation and then later on involve the project teams if the pools do indeed take off. Trusted partners could enable this process.",

During that time I built a comprehensive risk framework for Fuse pools - including backtesting and future-looking estimation. [Implementation is underway and docs will be out soon.]\n\n### Abstract\nI would like to continue this collaboration and work on the following deliverables:\n\nContinue handling Fuse Risk framework - especially in light of layer 2 (new dexes, new oracles with different attack surface and latency). Document the same.\nManage grants - establish Grants Station - a governance framework and workflow for grants. Actively seek new onboards and act as communication bridge. (KPI: Number of grants)\nPool creation - innovate and create new exotic pools for Rari (KPI: Number of pools, TVL)\n(possible) Integrations - explore integrations with other projects, such as a potential one with Pendle (KPI: Number of integrations, TVL)\n(possible) Fuse 2.0 - explore a redesign of the lending model from first principles to maximise capital efficiency and user benefit on L2.\nConsulting on all other matters - tokenomics, UX and so forth\nI would like to be paid 800 RGT for the 2 month duration 18 May to 18 July 2021. Accepting RGT denomination and only at the end of this period ensures I'm incentive-aligned with Rari and will work to improve the protocol and RGT price.\n\nI have backdated this proposal to 18 May as an exception, however, going forward I would like to establish a precedent of getting work approved before it is officially worked on.\n\n### Motivation\nRisk framework - Fuse is planning to open up permissionless listing for assets. This however requires responsible disclosure of risks to lenders, borrowers and yield farmers. Assets can be volatile, illiquid or contain systemic risks - all need to be handled. Layer 2 will also open up new attack surfaces that need to be dealt with.\nManage grants - Largely elucidated in my Grant Station post\nPool creation - Largely elucidated in my post making me trusted partner for pool creation\nIntegrations - Essential to onboard new communities and create synergistic relationships with other projects beyond just token listings. Integrations will provide value-add services for Fuse users, and draw in TVL.\nFuse 2.0 - Most lending pools in use today are forks or minor variations of the Compound Finance model launched way back in 2017. Rebuilding a lending model from scratch could help overcome its limitations. A focus on the design space for L2 must be maintained.",

      "content": "### Summary\nGrant Station will enable more community members to work for Rari in return for grants approved by the Rari Capital DAO. The following governance framework is proposed to manage this. This proposal seeks discussion and approval over this framework.\n\n[Link to Grant Station governance framework](https://www.notion.so/Grant-Station-Governance-Framework-478b0fbff17348d7a15a0360da789091)\n\n### Background\nSo far, Rari's founding members have been responsible for nearly all developer contributions for Rari's products. Even non-technical work such as community moderation, management of resources and so on has falled primarily on their shoulders.\n\nMore recently however, the set of contributors has been expanded with the hires of [myself](https://forums.rari.capital/d/56-rip-24-collaboration-with-samuel-shadrach/6), [Sharad Shekar](https://forums.rari.capital/d/61-rip-25-collaboration-with-sharad-shekar-frontend-dev/4) and [Gautham Elango](https://forums.rari.capital/d/65-rip-26-collaboration-with-gautham-elango-solidityreact-dev/12).\n\nA proper governance framework would help streamline this expansion process.\n\n### Abstract\nThese are the broad decisions that need to be undertaken in the grant process.\n\n1. Approve the core concept / task as beneficial to Rari\n2. Approve a payment for this\n3. Approve a specific individual or group to complete the work\n4. Approve the work done by this individual as satifactory, in order to finally release payment\n1 and 2 have been clubbed in the form of a Concept proposal. 3 is an Implementation proposal. 4 is a Payment release proposal\n\nAll proposals go first through forum and then snapshot. This slows down the process but ensures full decentralisation and transparency at every step, not just the final vote.\n\n### Motivation\nCommunity involvement in the Rari Capital has so far primarily been discussion and approval for key decisions, and feedback over what features should be implemented. Allowing more contibutors to work on Rari and negotiate directly with the DAO provides the broader community with a lot more direct control over the future of Rari.\n\nHiring more contributors enables work to get done at a faster pace, which is hugely beneficial.\n\nEven community members who do not wish to work on Rari themselves are more empowered as they can now ideate, and get concepts and grants for those approved by the DAO in the form of a Concept proposal. This is major improvement over the status quo where only informal feature requests could be made.",

      "title": "Reimbursement - Final Plan",
      "content": "Reimbursement - Final reimbursement steps\n\nSummary:\nThis vote is to determine the final stages in how we reimburse the Rari Capital users who lost funds during the hack of early May. The vote will help assess: payment denomination, payment intervals, multi-bond structure, and maturity dates. Each of these are bundled into various different options. \n\nBackground:\nhttps://forums.rari.capital/d/77-protocol-reimbursement-plans\n\nAbstract:\nThere are a few different things that need to be decided on: \n1. Payment denomination: determining the goal distribution of the bonds (the lost amount of ETH or the lost amount of ETH denominated in Dai at the time of exploit or even the same for RGT) \n2. Multi-bond structure: determining if we want to create multiple bonds to make it easy for the protocol to pay off the vast majority of people. \n3. Maturity dates: determining when we‚Äôd want these bonds to expire/mature.\n4. Payment intervals: determining when governance will convene to vote on the current treasury plans and how to allocate capital \n\nInstead of creating an individual vote for each of these which would potentially result in a subpar solution, they are combined into various different packaged votes to promote harmony between the results. \n\nPackage A: \nPayment denomination: Dai (at time of exploit)\nPayment interval: Quarterly\nMulti-bond structure: No\nMaturity date: 4 years \n\nPackage B: \nPayment denomination: ETH \nPayment interval: Quarterly\nMulti-bond structure: No\nMaturity date: 4 years \n\nPackage C: \nPayment denomination: Dai (at time of exploit)\nPayment interval: Quarterly\nMulti-bond structure: \n- Yes\n- 1 small bond, reimburses small holders (defined as <5 ETH in balance at the time of the hack, total bond amount equal to >160 ETH, USD equivalent at time of exploit) in a 6 month bond\n- 1 normal bond with everything else that‚Äôs already defined\nMaturity date: 4 years \n\nPackage D: \nPayment denomination: ETH \nPayment interval: Quarterly\nMulti-bond structure: \n- Yes\n- 1 small bond, reimburses small holders (defined as <5 ETH in balance at the time of the hack, total bond amount equal to >160 ETH, ETH equivalent at time of exploit) in a 9 month bond\n- 1 normal bond with everything else that‚Äôs already defined\nMaturity date: 4 years \n\nPackage E: \nPayment denomination: RGT (based on Dai amount at time of exploit) \nPayment interval: Quarterly\nMulti-bond structure: No\nMaturity date: 4 years \n\nRealistically, by the maturity date either: \n1. The protocol will be very successful and can easily pay off the bonds\n2. The protocol will be successful and can liquidate $RGT for the bonds \n3. The protocol will not have enough $RGT or capital for the bonds and will default \n\nThose options outlined above are less likely to happen if payment denomination is in ETH as we don‚Äôt know what the price of ETH will be. The protocol can explore #2 using the team allocation as maturity nears. Governance may also choose to reimburse the ETH amount down the line if the protocol is in a mature enough state and a proposal is created. Additionally as liquid markets appear for the bonds, the protocol can explore enabling borrowing against the bonds using Fuse. \n\nEarly repayment of the bonds is in the protocol's best interests. If the protocol has the firepower to do this, it should consider this during its payment meetings (defined as when the payment interval is). The same goes for the smaller bonds.\n\nMotivation:\nTo reimburse REPT holders who lost capital during the hack through the most effective route necessary. \n\nNext Steps:\nVote to determine the package that will be shipped to REPT holders.",

We‚Äôve come up with (and begun building) several initiatives outlined in this deck that we are confident will both build awareness of the Rari brand in the general public and also penetrate and connect with the existing Rari community.\n\nAbstract: \n\nWe propose an 8-week partnership with the DAO to get heads turning about Rari and connect with our community in consistent yet exciting ways. In order to build a long-term brand, now more than ever Rari needs to focus on building awareness in the community and serving users in both crypto-centric and non-crypto-centric ways outlined in the deck attached to this proposal.\n\nIn the deck, we‚Äôve outlined 28 ways we‚Äôll help Rari catapult it‚Äôs growth trajectory and set up long-term success for the brand. Aside from community management + engagement, we believe focusing on upper-funnel objectives is paramount to building a sustainable brand presence, so that‚Äôs what many of these ideas aim to do. Overall, we're extremely excited for what the future holds for Layer3 x Rari.\n\nWe ask for 500 RGT compensation for our services and 5000 USDT from the Treasury to fund product development and marketing costs (RGT Bounty, Digital Drops, etc.).\n\nMotivation: The best brands aren‚Äôt built accidentally ‚Äì they created big stories that genuinely connect with existing and new users. Rari is the most ambitious and hungriest team ever, so let‚Äôs make sure our marketing matches.\n\nTwitter: @layer3xyz or @dariyaxyz\nWebsite: https://layer3.xyz",

      "content": "Summary: Partner with growth marketing firm Layer3 for an 8-week trial period to expand and penetrate the Rari Community.\n\nDECK: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L6TALeqfIlZ6N7ubT5An7XUHLAdZRZ2G/view?usp=sharing\n\nBackground: For the past few weeks, Layer3 has been working directly with Rari to create a long-term growth marketing strategy for the brand. We‚Äôve come up with (and begun building) several initiatives outlined in this deck that we are confident will both build awareness of the Rari brand in the general public and also penetrate and connect with the existing Rari community.\n\nAbstract:\n\nWe propose an 8-week partnership with Rari to get heads turning about the brand and connect with our community in consistent yet exciting ways. In order to build a long-term brand, now more than ever Rari needs to focus on building awareness in the community and serving users in both crypto-centric and non-crypto-centric ways outlined in the deck attached to this proposal.\n\nIn the deck, we‚Äôve outlined 28 ways we‚Äôll help Rari catapult it‚Äôs growth trajectory and set up long-term success for the brand. Aside from community engagement, we believe focusing on upper-funnel objectives are paramount to building a sustainable brand presence, so that‚Äôs what many of these ideas aim to do.\n\nWe ask for 500 RGT in compensation for our services and an additional 5000 USDT from the Treasury to fund product development and marketing costs.\n\nMotivation: The best brands aren‚Äôt built accidentally ‚Äì they created big stories that genuinely connect with existing and new users. Rari is the most ambitious and hungriest team ever, so let‚Äôs make sure our marketing matches.\n\nFOR: Partner with Layer3 to launch growth initiatives outlined in the deck attached. Pay ~500 RGT + 5000 USDT (for marketing + development costs)\nAGAINST: Do not partner with Layer3 and do not launch these growth initiatives\n\nTwitter: @layer3xyz or @dariyaxyz\nWebsite: https://layer3.xyz",

When people deposit into PoolTogether they receive back a token that represents a claim on their deposited capital. As of today there are no protocols that support this token as collateral. Supporting this token as collateral on Fuse should drive a large amount of deposits and borrowing against the collateral.\n\nMotivation:\nThe core value proposition of Fuse is creation of lending markets for long tail assets. PoolTogether deposit tokens represent an ideal target because they are both very popular and widely held but not yet supported by any lending protocol.\n\nWhitelisting PoolTogether deposit tokens will increase protocol utilization and also showcase what is possible with Fuse\n\n\nhttps://forums.rari.capital/d/79-whitelist-pooltogether-as-fuse-pool-creator",

      "title": "Reimbursement - Which strategy?",
      "content": "Summary\nTo determine the path forward in how we reimburse users who lost their ETH during last weeks hack.\n\nBackground\nhttps://forums.rari.capital/d/77-protocol-reimbursement-plans/\n\nAbstract\nBelow are the following options for reimbursement ( a follow up vote will be used to determine the exact variables of the chosen strategy ):\n\n1 - Plain RGT\n2 - Traditional bonds\n3 - Convertible bonds\n4 - Options\n5 - Pass the stick\n6 - Combination\n\nAll of the actions above do not involve a sale of any $RGT from the DAO.\n\nAdditionally, where it is possible we will airdrop the asset into the REPT asset. This means that you aren't receiving an airdrop, if you own REPT, you still own your REPT-just the composition of the asset is changing (to potentially include one of the solutions outlined below). If you were proactive and redeemed your REPT, then you will receive an airdrop of REPT.\n\n1 - Plain RGT\nTake X amount of $RGT and distribute it to help make the users who lost money whole again. Governance can later determine vesting lengths and amounts.\n\n2 - Traditional Bonds\nThis would be creating a new asset, rariBONDS, that will be delivered to the REPT holders who lost capital. These bonds would be paid off by the DAO as its revenues increase. Users who receive the rariBONDS can either hold them until maturity or they can sell them using the YieldSpace developed by the Yield Protocol (an AMM built for trading assets like this). These are zero coupon bonds. Governance can later determine the length of these bonds and if we want multiple of them. Governance can also explore liquidity mining the YieldSpace to ensure it is liquid for users who potentially want to sell their rariBONDS before maturity. The Yield Protocol team is ready to move forward on this, right away.\n\n3 - Convertible Bonds\nThis is pretty much the same as the previous solution, however, it would implement convertibility. What does that mean? Essentially we can offer a specified amount of $RGT per bond as an alternative to the redemption at maturity. This could potentially work as an option and would be an attractive option for users who think $RGT would appreciate in value while also offering ETH to the users. We could again liquidity mine the YieldSpace AMM as described in the solution above to make sure these assets are liquid. The YieldSpace AMM isn't set up to work if the $RGT were to rise beyond the value lost, however, liquidity would likely migrate to Uniswap or a similar DEX. Governance can explore the amount of $RGT airdropped if a conversion event takes place on the bond, in addition to all the parameters of a traditional bond. We could also add convertibility down the line if governance chooses.\n\n4 - Options\nThis is likely most similar to the plain RGT option. We would let users choose different options that have various different strike prices and different lengths. It is likely that the closer to the length, the higher the strike price would be. This could be one of the least capital intensive options as not all of the options may be exercised (but that is also a potentially bad ux for users). We could structure these options pretty easily using the Auctus protocol. Governance would later choose all of the aforementioned parameters.\n\n5 - Pass the Stick\nCommunity member, Ben, has taken the lead on potentially developing a community multi-sig. This would be an additional DAO in addition to the one that is currently running. This option would delegate X $RGT (X=decided by governance later) to this multi-sig who is able to negotiate deals on the protocols behalf. Ben has already gotten 0xMaki, Anthony Sassano, Mariano.eth, CMS Holdings, Darren and Daryl Lau and Ric Burton on the multi-sig.\n\n6 - Combination\n- Distribute RGT to each holder (vested across 3 months), up to 20 ETH. This will instantly make whole about 722 out of the 757 $REPT holders (that is 95% of users who are instantly reimbursed!) who lost money (this doesn't account for users who have withdrawn but you can use this to get a picture of the user profiles: https://etherscan.io/token/0xcda4770d65b4211364cb870ad6be19e7ef1d65f4#balances).\n- Additionally, these potentially smaller holders will not have to deal with the complexity (and the gas costs) of products like the bonds\nDistribute rariBONDS (traditional bonds, that we liquidity mine) to each holder for their REPT balance - 20 ETH (if it's a positive number). This means that there will likely be about only 35 users who have to deal with these bond products. These users will have full flexibility on what they would like to do with their bonds (sell, hold till maturity, etc).\n\nMotivation\nTo reimburse REPT holders who lost capital during the hack.",

      "content": "**Summary:**\n\nI, Sharad, propose to be onboarded to Rari Capital‚Äôs DAO as a full-time front-end dev, to build and maintain the current product, as well as lead a brand new rebuilt front-end for Rari Capital.\n\n\n**Background:** \n\nAfter completing my temporary involvement with the Rari Capital DAO ([RIP 25](https://vote.rari.capital/#/rari/proposal/QmduWoe86hSwwaLxKrLbQdwVWLKzjx2MU9V6EBqE8bXDi1)), The Rari Capital Team has expressed interest in onboarding me full-time.\n\nIn the past two weeks, I have implemented a [dashboard for Rari users to track their positions](https://app.rari.capital/positions) across the Rari Ecosystem. I have also implemented a [highly requested UI feature](https://twitter.com/defipulse/status/1387506358447185920) which removes the need to have Web3 installed to browse the dApp.\n\nI am coming from my previous experience at Catalog - where I engineered the full-stack, and led the product engineering from inception to launch - accruing over $200k in NFT record sales to date.\n\n\nA bit more background on me:\n\n - [Github](https://github.com/sharad-s)\n - [Website](https://www.sharadshekar.com/)\n - Latest work - Catalog: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/catalogworks/) | [Website](https://beta.catalog.works/)\n\n\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nAs I join the Rari Capital DAO to lead frontend development, some of my responsibilities include:\n\n  - Building new features for the front-end.\n - Architecting and re-building a brand new Rari application from the ground up, using a blazing fast tech stack of Next.js/Ethers/Chakra-UI/Typescript. New designs included üòâ\n - Testing, code coverage, maintenance\n - Product integration\n\nFor pre-funding compensation, **the Rari Capital DAO has proposed 125 RGT / a week (50/50 vested non-vested) + 250 RGT signing bonus**, which can be adjusted on a 3 month basis, in accordance with deliverables and where the protocol is at. I have provided a few options higher and lower so that the DAO can vote on what they think is fair.\n\n\n**Motivation**\n\nAs the core front-end dev shifts focus to L2 Products (Nova), a skilled front-end dev is needed to lead front-end development while maintaining code quality. Furthermore, a brand new Rari Capital experience is being designed and developed internally, and I am beyond excited to bring it to life. I already have a significant stake in the network, and I look forward to doing my part to propel Rari Capital towards mass adoption.",

      "title": "RIP-29 (Fuse) Add a Euro/Dollar pool",
      "content": "#### Summary:\n\nI propose a new pool focused on foreign exchange assets, including prominent USD and EUR pegged stablecoins.\n\n#### Background:\n\nI think Fuse could be a great venue to kickstart foreign exchange markets within defi. Currently, there is very low support for most non-USD pegged stablecoins. I believe that a Fuse pool focusing on USD and EUR pegged stablecoins could be beneficial for the following reasons:\n\nUsers who denominate their expenses in EUR can hedge their foreign exchange risk. They would do this by depositing EUR denominated stablecoins to the fuse pool as collateral, and then borrowing USD stablecoins for farming or investment purposes.\nUsers with EUR denominated income living outside the Euro zone can hedge their forex risk by borrowing EUR.\nForex lending pools allow for carry trading (benefiting from interest rate differentials between currencies) as well as long/short strategies. This also allows for greater leverage, which may be necessary to make the volatility/potential returns great enough to interest defi investors.\nLending pools allow for more efficient market making in EUR stablecoins. Creation of a conservatively specced lending pool could help bootstrap greater liquidity in and demand for EUR stablecoins.\n\n#### Abstract:\n\nI'd like to propose a pool with the following parameters and assets. Note that the initial risk limits are fairly stringent, but could be loosened over time if conditions allow. Over the medium term I'd like to move to 85% collateral factor and 8% liquidation incentive.\n\n***Upgradeable:*** Yes\n***Liquidation Incentive:*** 8%\n***Close Factor:*** 100%\n***Platform Fee:*** 10%\n\n***Asset / Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor:***\nDAI / 80% / 15%\nUSDC / 80% / 15%\nsEUR / 80% / 20%\nEURS / 80% / 20%\n\n***Oracles:*** Use Chainlink Oracles. Use the corresponding fiat price instead of token specific price (eg. use 1 USD for DAI, EUR/USD for EURS and sEUR, etc).\n\nExplanation of parameter selection: I believe setting the close factor at 100% should help prevent risk of smaller borrowing positions being unprofitable to liquidate. Higher reserve factors were selected for EUR vs USD backed stablecoins due to their relatively lower liquidity in DEX platforms, which increases risk of upside spikes and volatility which could make short positions against the EUR tokens insolvent.\n\n***Administrator:*** I propose setting the administrator for upgrades as the PastaDAO governance timelock (0x78bd635e7c76d6a48d1e4bda89e95ae8394ded11), controlled by governor alpha (0x9bb5a48878baa8bd884ecf6bdbc3812ca2bf9b9f) and staked PASTA/ETH LP holders (0x19f6afe15c7fd8a900dbc86623b0d36912a2af1f). The intent is to adjust risk parameters over time as conditions chance, and hopefully allow for greater leverage if non-USD stablecoins see improved on chain liquidity.\n\n***Risks:*** Because the oracles would use fiat prices to mark positions and trigger liquidation, any deviation from the peg in a constituent stablecoin beyond the 10% liquidation incentives could lead to pool insolvency.\n\n#### Motivation:\n\nI believe this pool could be beneficial to the Rari community by positioning Fuse as the leading platform for EUR trading and lending in defi. It could also help drive usage from Europe based investors and savers.\n\n***For:*** Create a EuroDollar Fuse Pool per the specification above.\n\n***Against:*** Do not create a EuroDollar Fuse Pool.",

Horizons Law is a leading crypto law firm and Ryon Nixon can add value in securing the Rari Capital product lineup (from a regulator POV) and lay the foundation for the inevitable expansion (like fundraising and M&A).\n\nBackground\nHorizons Law is a leading crypto corporate law firm who has worked with various projects like Synthetix, Solana and Flow to ensure they are on the right side of regulation and helped assist them to become the projects they are today.\n\nWebsite: https://www.hrznslc.com/\n\nThe Rari Capital Team has worked with Horizons Law in the past. During Jack and Jai‚Äôs time at MyCrypto, they were able to closely collaborate with Horizons Law (Ryon Nixon, Partner at Horizons Law, specifically) which has allowed them to determine this is the best partner as the legal heads of the protocol as it grows.\n\nAbstract\nAfter deep discussions with Ryon Nixon, the following terms are being proposed:\nLock in a price of $15 per RGT\nSet up a 3 month vest for each token being received\nSet a maximum of a $30,000 spend before the terms are re-negotiated, which will require another protocol vote\n\nAfter enlisting Ryon Nixon and engaging with Horizons Law through Jai Bhavnani, one of the protocol pioneers, they will become the protocol‚Äôs legal team.\n\nAs the protocol‚Äôs legal team, they will be responsible for:\nEnsuring substantial compliance with the current products and token\nAdvising over future governance and product decisions\nAssisting with protocols expansion via potential fundraising and M&A activities\n\nWhile this may seem like a large expenditure, ensuring the protocol is on the right side of the law will prove beneficial over the long term. Ryon Nixon will represent the protocol as an autonomous lawyer but may also represent Jai Bhavnani through his Firm when it is necessary, for the sole purpose of acting as a bridged entity to help the protocol. The facilitation of discussions with the legal team will be led by Jai Bhavnani, primarily in open forums where everyone is encouraged to participate in determining the best route to deploy this talent (when it can be).\n\n‚ÄúAutonomous lawyering,\" means that in analyzing or discussing law or law-related matters, I am representing myself or acting non-representationally in the context of belonging to a community of incentive-aligned supporters of a decentralized technology system. These communities and the persons in them are not my clients and I have no intention to treat their information as confidential or attorney-client privileged. I am acting on my own behalf, but will seek to provide accurate and honest information while observing my general nonrepresentational professional responsibilities such as demonstrating respect for the legal system.\n\nMotivation\nOne of the biggest questions left in DeFi is how regulation will respond. By working with lawyers in such an early stage, it will enable us to be prepared for any shift in regulation. Additionally, working with the legal team will enable us to access a wide range of opportunities that weren‚Äôt possible before.",

Set collateral factors as follows:\nRGT 60% ETH 65% INV 50% ALCX 50% SFI 50% WBTC 60% USDC 65% SUSHI 60% YAM 50% MPH 50% LINK 65% BADGER 60% COVER 50% FTM 50% DAI 65% HEGIC 55% KP3R 50%\n3. Set all 100% utilisation borrow rates to approx. 700%\n4. Set 80% utilisation borrow rates as follows:\nRGT 50% ETH 30% INV 100% ALCX 100% SFI 100% WBTC 30% USDC 80% SUSHI 30% YAM 100% MPH 100% LINK 30% BADGER 30% COVER 100% FTM 50% DAI 80% HEGIC 50% KP3R 50%\n5. Recommend supply caps based on liquidable amounts at 10% slippage\n(Some of these changes may require time for implementation due to ongoing developmental work, this proposal however binds community support for these changes.)\n\n## Background\nFuse is an exciting new product by Rari that allows you to borrow, long or short any asset against any other asset. To iterate quickly and obtain real market data, pools were created and parameters were set intuitively. Now that we are more mature we are looking to establish a more standardised and data-driven approach to risk.\n\nResource: [A standard risk model for Fuse](https://forums.rari.capital/d/63-proposed-risk-model-for-fuse)\n\nApplying these principles to Fuse Pool 3 yields a number of desirable and potentially necessary changes to safeguard user interests.\n\n## Abstract\nChanges are guided by the proposed risk model (linked above).\n\nChange 1: Liq incentive to 30%\nAs described in our model, protocol only needs to absorb shock, whereas liquidators need to absorb shock, slippage and gas. Therefore 8% incentive for liquidators is too low and leftover allowance for protocol (100% - 8% - cf) is unnecessarily high.\n\nThis is a high risk pool comprising of numerous volatile and illiquid assets - where all assets can be borrowed against each other. Therefore shock allowance will be decided by the most potentially volatile asset in the pool. We will allow 20% for shock.\n\nSince some assets are illiquid, 10% has been allowed for slippage (or gas).\n\nChange 2: Change CFs\nKeeping in mind a liq incentive of 30% and a slippage allowance of 10%, we can set CFs based on shock tolerances of individual assets. These get set in the 50-70% range due to 20% max shock tolerance and 30% liq incentive. Less volatile assets get higher CFs.\n\nChange 3: Set 100% util rates to 700%\nSince all assets can be borrowed against each other, it does not make sense to set different wind-down periods for different assets. A wind-down period of 2 month may be ideal. This corresponds to a 100% util rate of around 700%\n\nChange 4: Change 80% util rates\n80% util rates are to be set based on the maximum borrowers will be willing to pay for the likely use cases.\n\nUse case of USDC, DAI is borrowing and longing other assets. There may be high demand for this so 80% has been set.\n\nUse case for most other assets is shorting. Higher interest rates are charged on more volatile assets due to higher potential profits and risks involved.\n\nSuggested rates are experimental, and may be lowered in the future if sufficient borrow demand is not found.\n\nChange 5: Recommend collateral caps at 10% slippage for those assets\nSince we have allowed a 10% slippage tolerance, we will also recommend collateral caps at 10% slippage.\n\nSuppose LINK-ETH has liquidity primarily on Uniswap and this liquidity is 1,300,000 LINK against 22,300 ETH. Selling 65,000 LINK will cause 10% slippage, hence this Fuse pool will have a recommended supply cap of 65,000 LINK.\n\nIf this Fuse pool has more than 65,000 LINK deposited, the risk of this pool increases and appropriate action such as decreasing collateral factor or implementing a supply cap may be needed.\n\n## Motivation\nDAO Fuse pools must ensure relative safety of both their lenders and borrowerers under extreme market conditions, while simultaneously being able to offer high risk products such as leverage and shorting on illiquid assets. We believes these parameters meaningfully capture this tradeoff.\n\nAt the same we do not wish to disturb the user experience of those who are already using these pools. Although liquidation incentive has increased, collateral factors have also been increased for many assets - leading to an overall better user experience.\n\nAn attempt has been made to ensure interest rates are competitive and maximise both lenders' yield and protocol revenue, without trampling over borrower interests. High rates at 100% utilisation may prove necessary from a risk perspective, especially in these early days.",

I'm 25 years-old and a former engineering student from Texas. My latest work is Catalog, the sole music-exclusive NFT marketplace. I led the engineering of the product from October through our March launch, where we have since captured over $100k in record sales. My reason for moving on is primarily that I'm more interested in DeFi than in NFTs and creator economies.\n\nI'm a scrappy hacker type and I like to ship quality work fast. My initial involvement with the Rari team was through an open PR. My bread and butter tech stack is Next.js on the frontend, and Hasura/Web3 on the backend.\n\n - Github: https://github.com/sharad-s\n - Website: https://www.sharadshekar.com/\n - Twitter: https://twitter.com/brownsvgar\n - Latest work (Catalog): \n    - https://twitter.com/catalogworks/\n    - https://beta.catalog.works/\n\nAbstract\nI propose to work for the DAO to help build a user investment dashboard, tracking personal deposits, interest and growth across the Rari ecosystem products including Fuse, Earn, Pool2, and Tranches.

      "content": "Summary\n\nI, Samuel, propose to work for the Rari Capital DAO on a trial basis of 2 weeks to help with adding new pools and assets, and risk management. 200 RGT will be provided as compensation.\n\n[Compensation has been updated from the forum post]\n\nBackground\n\nI'm an avid DeFi enthusiast, who has been hooked ever since the Chef Nomi saga. I'm 20-years-old, from India, and also an engineering student. I bring a variety of practical and technical knowledge to the table. Technical knowledge would include investment theory, layer two scaling, DeFi market design, MEV and so forth. Practical knowledge would include community mentality (apes üòÜ), incentives and marketing.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/SamuelShadrach4\nBlog: https://noma.substack.com/\n\nAbstract\n\nI propose to work for the DAO to help with the following work:\n\nRisk management and safety scores (RSS). Provide guidelines and standards for risk management, especially in the case of DAO managed pools and the yield aggregator. Fine-tune collateral factors, interest rate curves, supply caps and so on.\nPool management. General management/auditing of pools\nIntegrations and marketing. Innovate and add new types of assets and protocols into our ecosystem. Also help with marketing and getting liquidity for the same.\nI would like to join Rari for a trial period of 2 weeks for a payment of 200 RGT, subject to DAO approval. Full-time onboarding to be discussed consequently.\n\nMotivation\n\nRari Capital has made strides in innovating new primitives - such as general-purpose money markets and general-purpose yield aggregators. These primitives need to now be populated with meaningful economic activity - in the form of various products that users would like. We have a narrow timeframe where we retain user attention - in which we must integrate various assets and useful products. Adding hands on deck will speed up this process.\n\nAdditionally we need to provide guidelines and safety scores - to manage risk in the DAO pools, the yield aggregator and provide guidelines that users may optionally follow in their own custom pools.",

      "content": "As an investor in Rari Capital, it's amazing to see how quickly the team is building new products, features, and more broadly innovating in the DeFi space.\n\nFuse's guarded launch set off a wave of interest for Rari Capital, and as it rolls out to the public along with Tanks and an upcoming Rari mobile app, we need to be ready to welcome tens of thousands (or more) new investors into the Rari ecosystem this year.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nThe new investors that discover Rari Capital this year will also be exploring all the other DeFi projects built on Ethereum. Therefore, we need to recognize that the attention span of newcomers will be very short, and their demand for immediate answers to their pressing questions will be strong.\n\nWe also need to recognize that building a consumer-facing mobile app will create a flood of users who know nothing about DeFi or crypto.\n\nThis creates a dilemma and an opportunity.\n\nThe Dilemma\n\nThe Rari team has a large pipeline of products to release this year. Answering repetitive questions on Discord and Twitter isn't an optimal use of their time, but ignoring those questions isn't a good strategy either.\n\nSo far the team has done a great job threading the needle on support. They created high level docs and FAQs on Notion, they do regular community calls, and give direct responses to users on Discord.\n\nHowever, direct response customer support doesn't scale well, and all the important content that newcomers are looking for is spread across multiple platforms. As the Rari community grows, it's important that all the knowledge being shared by the Rari team is accessible to anyone at any moment, whether it originally came from Discord, Notion, a YouTube interview, or somewhere else.\n\nIt is also important that all content is displayed in a familiar, user-friendly format directly on the Rari Capital site.\n\nThat's why I am proposing a more scalable solution to customer support. One that can:\n\n- Give every Rari newcomer the white glove support they deserve\n- Give the team time to focus on their high-priority pipeline of products\n- Improve visitor conversion rates and help onboard new capital to the Rari ecosystem\n\nThe Opportunity\n\nMy proposal is to create a real-time searchable library of everything Rari newcomers might want to know about. Inspired by Apple's support system (https://support.apple.com/), this site should be tightly integrated with the Rari app, and will precisely follow the existing Rari site design and format.\n\nIt will feature:\n\n- Thoughtful deep-dives on hundreds of the most commonly asked Discord/Twitter questions as the community asks them. Here is an example from Apple: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlp2265/mac\n- Full-length product guides. Here is an example from Apple: https://support.apple.com/airpods\n- All existing Rari videos, community calls, and external interviews in a user-friendly dashboard. Here is an example from Netflix: https://www.netflix.com/ca/browse/genre/839338\n- A dictionary of DeFi definitions to help newcomers navigate Rari and the entire Ethereum ecosystem. This will help Rari users and act as a public good benefiting everyone in the DeFi space.\n\nProject Plan\n\nI plan to work with the Rari Capital team to make sure all design and formatting meets their standards, and to make sure all content is up to date and in line with their tone/style. I plan to work closely with the Rari Capital community to prioritize the guide topics and blog posts to answer all of their most pressing questions.\n\nProject Timeline\n\nProject Development: 14 Days\n\nContent Creation: 30 Days\n\nI will be publishing new content every day for the first 30 days of project launch. I expect to write roughly 10,000-15,000 words of original content per month. After the first month of content, I will create another proposal with the results of the first 30 days, and the DAO can decide whether they want me to continue creating content, or have someone else take over the project.\n\nThe Rari DAO will own all IP and content related to the project either way.\n\nProject Cost\n\nDevelopment Cost: $5,000 USD\n\nContent Creation Cost: $5,000 USD/mo\n\nTotal Proposal Cost: $10,000 USD\n\nPayment to be made in $RGT, using the $RGT price as of the Snapshot vote completion.\n\n*A note on funding: In the forum discussion related to this proposal, the Rari team mentioned that the treasury only had $15k to spend on new projects. Since then, a proposal has passed to re-direct Loopring rewards ($1M+) back to the Rari treasury to help fund projects like this and others that are helping to build up the Rari ecosystem.\n\nLanding Page Mock-Up\n\nBelow is a rough sketch of what the main landing page could look like. Each section will need a slightly different page format with different functionalities (real-time search, tile design, etc...), but I welcome all feedback and ideas for improving the support library.\n\nhttps://rari-support-library.webflow.io/",

      "content": "Summary:\nThe yield aggregator is at the centerpiece of Rari Capital, it is how we started. Let's enable it to begin to start directing capital into the Fuse pools that are safe.\n\nBackground:\nYou can view Fuse here:\nhttps://app.rari.capital/fuse\n\nYou can view the yield aggregator here:\nhttps://app.rari.capital/\n\nAbstract:\nThe yield aggregator currently has millions of dollars spread across the few pools. In the way that the aggregator rebalances between strategies like Compound, dYdX, etc--I propose that we add Fuse pools to this list. For the sake of this proposal, we will begin with Fuse Pools: 6, 7 & 8. This will enable us to decrease the risk, as the Rari Safety Score continues to evolve with time. The goal will work towards a future where the Rari Safety Score is the only variable in determining whether the yield aggregator can enter into a pool, but until then, the DAO will be charged with manually whitelisting the pools and using the safety scores as a metric to judge risk by. Additionally, it will enable us to trial how this works and ideally give lower rates to borrowers on Fuse and higher rates to the yield aggregator depositors. The pools that this should be activated on are: ETH pool, Stable Pool and Yield Pool.\n\nThis is the beginning of the Rari Capital flywheel that will enable us to offer something that very few other teams can offer. I'm super excited to be proposing this and I am excited to continue the conversation below.\n\nA later proposal could increase the breadth of pools worked with and eventually move to the RSS completely. \n\nMotivation:\nEnabling higher rates for yield aggregator users + lower rates for borrowers in Fuse.",

Recently Ruler Protocol launched xRULER, the interest yielding RULER token that will eventually earn protocol fees for stakers of the RULER token. Ruler Protocol provides a unique model that opens the doors for a long term collaborative relationship whereby idle assets within Ruler can look to possibly receive yield returns via RARIs yield aggregation product. Alternatively there is yet to be explored opportunities for other yield strategies that can leverage the RULER model of liquidation free risk to the borrower in search of better compounding returns that may not be available to the asset today.\n\nProposed market parameters;\nIRM: Cream model (Ref - RIP16)\nCollateral Factor: 40%\nReserve Factor: 30%\n\nBenefits for Rari Capital and RGT\n\nAligns further incentive for RULER to support the ongoing use of RGT token in RULER protocol,as well as providing rewards\n\nCreate new strategies unseen in the DeFi space that can provide fixed and variable yield returns for a ‚Äúbase line‚Äù return effect.\n\nxRULER token holders would add additional TVL into the already popular Pool3 in FUSE. Long term, RULER, would be an ideal partner for building strategies to leverage idle assets and boost returns for RULER LPs while providing RGT the opportunity to earn more fees.\n\nOur Strengths\n\nRuler Protocol is currently the only protocol offering liquidation free loans on non-like assets (Alchemix currently achieves a non-liquidatable position on USD to USD pairing). This power to the borrower allows for an easier to manage experience when it comes to risk overall as the user no longer needs to maintain a collateral ratio in fear of being liquidated, with the protocol placing the assumed risk on the lender.\n\nAdditional Details on RULER Protocol can be found here\nMedium: https://rulerprotocol.medium.com/\nApp: https://app.rulerprotocol.com/app/xRULER\nWebsite: https://rulerprotocol.com/",

Loopring users are only dumping $RGT. I propose that we redirect the Loopring rewards to the treasury and remove the vest, enabling the Rari DAO to utilize the $RGT effectively for blitzscaling operations.\n\nBackground:\nThe Rari Treasury address can be found here:\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x10db6bce3f2ae1589ec91a872213dae59697967a\n\nYou can view details about the Loopring Liquidity Mining Program here:\nhttps://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-l2-liquidity-mining-round-4-40661e9f88d7\n\nAbstract:\nThe whole initiative behind the Loopring collaboration was to enable anyone to purchase an allocation into one of the Rari Pools at a low cost (because of the discounted gas on an L2 environment). However, this collaboration has seen NO retail engagement. Additionally, the $RGT that the DAO is spending in liquidity mining (to make this possible, by creating liquid markets) is just being dumped by whales as the rewards are mined.\n\nThe team is doing amazing things. \n\nI believe that we should empower the DAO to make larger decisions, better decisions and enable them to pursue the things they want. The team should not be worried about audit costs, scaling costs or anything, especially considering that they have never done a fundraise.\n\nMotivation:\nLet's do this proposal to help the protocol grow significantly and remove the upper bound in terms of resources that the team was previously limited to. Additionally, let's stop those Loopring whales from dumping.",

      "content": "Summary:\n\nWe propose an upgradeable Ren cross-chain asset focused pool that will support current and future cross-chain assets supported by RenVM, beginning with renBTC and renFIL, and including ETH, USDC, and DAI in the pool as those are the most popular collateral assets on Ethereum.\n\nBackground:\n\nThe Ren Project launched RenVM, a byzantine fault-tolerant network that is able to securely in a decentralized manner do ECDSA threshold key generation and signing via secure multi-party computation, which allows RenVM to securely manage (ECDSA) private keys of different assets like Bitcoin and Filecoin, and wrap these assets on smart-contract chains like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Since launch, RenVM has processed about $4 billion in total volume of Bitcoin, Zcash, Dogecoin and Filecoin going to and from Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.\n\nAll Ren-assets on Ethereum are standard ERC-20 contracts, that are 1:1 representations of the native assets, and are redeemable at any time for the native assets, and can be created at any time using the native assets through any of the bridge UI built by the Ren team or third-party developers, like the RenBridge or the DeFi Bridge.\n\nWe foresee Zcash (as renZEC) to be added to the pool early after the potential launch of this pool, given outside developments which should land a Chainlink oracle for ZEC/USD, and will pursue price feeds for other assets supported by RenVM like Dogecoin, DigiByte and Terra (LUNA), and any future additions to RenVM.\n\nContracts and price feeds:\n\nrenBTC ERC-20 contract: https://etherscan.io/token/0xeb4c2781e4eba804ce9a9803c67d0893436bb27d\nrenFIL ERC-20 contract: https://etherscan.io/token/0xD5147bc8e386d91Cc5DBE72099DAC6C9b99276F5\n\nBTC price feed: https://data.chain.link/btc-usd\nFIL price feed: https://data.chain.link/fil-usd\n\nInitial pool parameters:\n\nUpgradeable: Yes\nClose Factor: 50%\nLiquidation Incentive: 8%\nrenBTC Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 50% / 25%\nrenFIL Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 45% / 25%\nETH Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 75% / 20%\nUSDC Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 75% / 15%\nDAI Collateral Factor / Reserve Factor: 75% / 15%\n\nMotivation:\n\nThe proposed Ren cross-chain asset pool would be a unique offering in all of DeFi given the nascence of cross-chain DeFi, allowing the market to permissionlessly borrow multiple non-Ethereum asets such as Bitcoin and Filecoin which isn't possible anywhere else at the moment. The pool would also be in the best interest of the large Ren community which will actively take part in managing and promoting this pool through our currently developing DAO.\n\nRisks:\n\nAll assets supported by RenVM share the same security, which makes it easy to add new assets to the pool as it does not affect the security assumptions, but it does mean that there is an increasing reliance on RenVM not breaking. Our highest priority though is working on making the RenVM network as safe and decentralized as possible, and we‚Äôll be launching many features during 2021 and forward to increase the safety and continually make it more decentralized.\n\nLink to forum post: https://forums.rari.capital/d/45-ren-cross-chain-asset-focused-pool-renbtcrenbchrenfilethusdcdai",

      "title": "RIP-18 (FUSE) Add a RAI/FRAX/USDC/DAI Pool to Fuse",
      "content": "Summary:\nWe propose the addition of a RAI/FRAX/USDC/DAI pool to Fuse. A pool like this would be unique for two main reasons: the rate at which RAI‚Äôs moving peg is repriced would supercharge the interest rates offered in the pool while opening new possibilities for Frax to deploy capital using an AMO that leverages RAI in combination with DAI and USDC.\n\nBackground:\nFRAX is the first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol. It is a hybrid model stablecoin which is more capital efficient than fully backed/overcollateralized models. Since launch in 2020, FRAX has never broken the peg and has stayed within 1 cent of $1 entirely which is an industry first for a non-overcollateralized stablecoin. FRAX also introduced the concept of Algorithmic Market Operations Controllers (AMOs) which allow for arbitrary market operation strategies that stabilize the price of FRAX by using other DeFi protocols. Due to FRAX‚Äôs capital efficiency and resilient peg stability, it is able to conduct important market operations through a proposed RAI AMO to purchase, mint, borrow, and/or lend assets in the Rari Fuse pool to keep FRAX tight to the peg.\n\nRAI is the very first stable asset with a moving peg that can impose both positive and negative ‚Äúinterest rates‚Äù on its holders. It is fully collateralized by ETH and managed by an on-chain PI controller. RAI‚Äôs controller is in charge with calculating a rate at which the moving peg increases or decreases, thus compelling market participants to bring RAI‚Äôs market price back and close to the peg. Due to this breakthrough in stable asset design, RAI‚Äôs mechanism can autonomously influence interest rates on secondary markets where it is being used. RAI‚Äôs design allows FRAX to leverage the moving peg mechanic and create an efficient and liquid money market. The FRAX AMO can lend RAI when the PI computed rate is positive and borrow RAI when the rate is negative.\n\nAbstract:\nThis proposal presents a setup for a new Fuse pool which includes FRAX, RAI, USDC and DAI. RAI‚Äôs repricing mechanism can have a direct impact on the interest rates offered in the pool while Frax‚Äôs AMO strategies can bring significant liquidity and usage.\n\nMotivation:\nThis proposal outlines a Fuse pool with characteristics that are not present in any other money market protocol. The pool takes advantage of RAI‚Äôs repricing mechanism in combination with Frax‚Äôs market operations framework in order to create a liquid market for stable assets.\n\nFor:\nAdd the RAI/FRAX/USDC/DAI stable asset money market in Fuse.\n\nAgainst:\nThe RAI/FRAX/USDC/DAI market is not added.\n\nLink to forum post:\nhttps://forums.rari.capital/d/44-stable-asset-focused-pool-fraxraiusdcdai",

The interest rate curves of these assets should be higher than the current average (from Cream/Compound/Aave) to account for the added risk. This proposal is being proposed at the same time as a similar one for stablecoin assets: \nhttps://vote.rari.capital/#/rari/proposal/QmePE8nRiVy4markC1doqv4CRRuUV4zrbPtMVNxhYwKYx4\n\nBackground:\nCREAM has more aggressive curves for all of the governance tokens that we offer. Compound and Aave have similar curves. We should be attracting all of this liquidity. Additionally, we should be compensating users for the added risk of the pool-based nature of popular pools.\n\nAbstract:\nCREAM has done great work in exploring interest rate models so we should adopt their model, but increase the rates by 25% (relative; not directly). You can view that model here, under governance+seed: https://docs.cream.finance/lending/interest-rate-model\n\nThis should effect the following pools:\n- Pool 1\n- Pool 2\n- Pool 3\n- Pool 4\n- Pool 5\n(not pool 0)\n\nThis will not effect:\n- Dai\n- USDC\n- (any other stablecoin)\n- ETH\n- WBTC\n(these were captured in the other IRM proposal previously linked)\n\nMotivation:\nEnsure that the Fuse DAO pools are competitive and able to compensate lenders and borrowers for offering the risk that they are taking when entering into pools.",

      "content": "Summary:\nThere are natural incentives for users to borrow \"stable assets\" (DAI, USDC, ETH and WBTC) but incentives to deposit these stable assets into a Fuse pool are low.\n\nThis is because the interest curves for these safe assets only go up to APYs that are standard (or less) compared to other interest rate protocols. This means that borrow rates are dangerously low while deposit rates are uncompetitive.\n\nNo one is going to supply DAI for 5% APY when the risks are higher than just depositing DAI on AAVE which currently is offering 10% APY.\n\nBorrowers are also getting an unfairly low rate for the amount of risk they put depositors in and they would likely be comfortable with paying higher borrow APYs on stable assets if it meant there would be more liquidity to borrow against!\n\nSince most of the assets in these DAO pools are not available anywhere else, we still offer a unique value proposition unmatched by other protocols and there is no competition for these borrowers to turn to for lower rates.\n\nBackground:\nThere is low liquidity of \"stable\" assets that are necessary for a healthy pool. Users are not willing to deposit their stable assets for measly APYs when they could get much better risk-adjusted returns elsewhere right now.\n\nAbstract:\nChange DAI, USDC, ETH, and WBTC's Interest Rate Models to the Cream's \"Stable + Major'' configuration with an additional 25% steepness increase in all DAO pools.\n\nMotivation:\nFuse DAO pools will not be useful to lenders if there are no stable assets to borrow against. \n\nFuse DAO pools are not appealing to lenders of stable assets as the risk adjusted returns are not high enough right now.\n\nFor: Change the interest curves of: DAI, USDC, ETH and WBTC to Cream's \"Stable + Major'' configuration + 25% steepness in all DAO pools.\n\nAgainst: Do nothing.",

      "content": "**Summary**\nIn order for Rari Capital to succeed, we need to do everything we can to get both the Rari Capital Protocol and RGT in people's minds every single day. Although our code is extremely important, we must ensure that our incentives are aligned with the community. Whether it is tutorials, podcasts, interviews, graphic design, AMAs, literally anything, Rari Capital needs to be in a position to compensate the individuals that go out of their ways each day to promote our protocol. These funds will be used transparently, with initiatives announced and discussed with the community prior to occurring. We will also ensure that the wallet address holding the RGT can easily be found by community members who want to look and make sure we are only using what was announced and discussed. This will provide a safe checks and balances system that can hold Rari Core accountable for all funds spent with this specified wallet. \n\n**Background**\nWe are in the final stages of our first ever meme contest. This contest brought over 100 submissions and hundreds of new members to our Discord. There was excitement all around and it was an amazing feeling to see all of the creativity that went into this.  In total, we decided to allocate 1,000 RGT. As we continue to purse more creative contests and initiatives mentioned above, we must allocate RGT into the \"Rari Capital Marketing Budget.\"\n\n**Abstract**\nI propose that we allocate 15,000 RGT from our most recent treasury purchase of 20,000 RGT. Having these funds set aside for Rari Capital Core and the community to spend on marketing efforts will significantly improve our presence on a multitude. of levels. Having this allocation of RGT set aside now will reduce the amount of future governance proposals each time and will only occur again once the marketing budget is in need of more funding. \n\n**Motivation**\nThe investment in a marketing budget will allow for the Rari Capital ecosystem to flourish by aligning incentives across our community and others.",

      "title": "[RIP-9] Divert liquidity mining rewards from Uni to Sushi & Loopring",
      "content": "Summary:\nI propose to redirect the planned Uniswap rewards mechanisms to Sushi and Loopring (80% / 20%). These rewards will be used to mine the strategy tokens in addition to the governance token on Loopring. This will use the liquidity created from RIP-2. \n\nBackground:\nThe Sushiswap team is like no other. With their aggressive pace of innovation and attention to community they are people that the Rari Team would like to work with. Additionally, Loopring is one of the first liquid DEX‚Äôs on a layer 2. Enabling our users to enter and exit positions on a Layer 2 would decrease their capital costs for smaller positions and liquidity mining makes that possible. \n\nAbstract:\n80% of the rewards will be going to Sushi for rewards. This will be in addition to our hopeful listing on the Onsen Menu for $SUSHI rewards. All of these rewards will be directed towards the $RGT / ETH pairing.\n\n20% of this will be going to Loopring for rewards. It will be split evenly between three tokens: $RGT, $RSPT (or whatever our later stable pool token is called) and $REPT. This will enable market makers to earn yield while capturing small arbitrage differences between the strategy tokens on the main chain and the layer 2. I imagine that it would make sense for a lot of our users (conducting trades < $2,000) to enter and exit positions via Loopring.

      "title": "[RIP-12] Switch to Semicen rebalance system and reward trusted rebalancers",
      "content": "Background:\n\nRari Capital plans to expand the amount of pools it offers significantly, which exponentially increases the amount of gas the Rari Capital team has to pay to perform rebalances for its users. At a certain point it becomes necessary to distribute the task of rebalancing between multiple parties for redundancy and reward those parties with fees, which is why this proposal has been created to begin the migration process to a more decentralized and scalable rebalance system.\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe Rari Capital team has developed a contract which we call the \"Semicen\" rebalance layer. This contract when given the permission to trigger rebalances allows multiple trusted parties (added and managed by the Rari Capital DAO) to rebalance a pool on a first-come, first \"serve\" basis and earn the fees generated during the time their rebalance was active.\n\nRebalancers can only move funds between integrated protocols (no sending to EOAs or untrusted wallets) and the Rari Capital DAO can punish rebalancers that misbehave. User funds are at 0 risk even if a trusted rebalancer goes rouge.\n\nThis proposal, if passed, will grant the RCAP team permission to swap out the current centralized rebalancer address for the Semicen contract.\n\nIt also grants the team permission to update the performance fee allocations by lowering the amount of fees that are sent to the smart treasury (currently 45%) to a minimum of 35% and allocate up to 10% of interest fees earned to rewarding rebalancers. \n\nThe allocation of rebalancer fees will be dynamically lowered to ensure rebalancers are only earning a minimal amount of profit (earnings after gas costs).\n\nIt may be necessary to re-evaluate the amount of fees that are allocated to rebalancers in the future which is why this proposal gives a safe amount of flexibility (a max of 10% of the pool's performance fees given to rebalancers, can be lowered without a vote) but also is aware that it may be necessary to re-evaluate the allocations in the future if pool liquidity/or gas costs change dramatically.\n\nTo learn more about the technical details and implementation of the Semicen contract, you are welcome to view the Github repo at https://github.com/Rari-Capital/semicen (currently under audit!)\n\nMotivation:\n\nA) Allow the Rari Protocol to scale its pool capacity by taking the fee burden off the Rari Capital Core team‚Äôs shoulders.\n\nB) To distribute the work required to calculate the optimal times and steps to perform a good rebalance across multiple actors. This is important when the amount of pools Rari Capital manages grows beyond single digits and into the hundreds.\n\nC) If a single rebalancer is not able to connect to the internet, any of the other trusted rebalancers can continue rebalancing the pool to earn the best returns for its depositors.\n\nLong term goals:\n\nThe Semicen contract is a temporary contract meant to be used while the development of a more decentralized (but more complex) solution is underway.\n\nThis contract is still useful for the reasons listed in the section above but is not a truly decentralized rebalance mechanism.\n\nWork is underway on a contract which will reach consensus via proof of stake, allow any RGT holder to participate and feature slashing and other punishments for misbehaviors.\n\nHowever, development time for this upgraded system is variable due to it's dependence on in-development L2 technologies, which is why the Semicen contract has been developed for use in the meantime.",

This proposal is to buy $20,000 worth of RGT off Uniswap to accumulate and store RGT in the treasury. The remaining funds should be deployed into the Rari Stable Pool to earn yield. Once RIP-5 goes into effect, the Smart Treasury will be in charge of maintenance. The premise for this proposal is to retain RGT as well as save the funds necessary for upcoming audits. \n\n**Background:**\nThe recent approval of RIP-5 will build a Smart Treasury, but in the meantime we have idle funds siting in our current treasury and not earning. Since this new treasury not been created yet, we should look into buying RGT off of Uniswap and reserving RGT for further use-cases. This will be more beneficial than storing stablecoins in their current forms. I also propose that we take the remaining funds after the slow $20,000 purchase of RGT and then deploy the assets into the Rari Stable Pool to earn interest. The RGT accumulated would provide future value through the storing and dispensing of RGT to contributors even before the Smart Treasury is ready. \n\n**Abstract:**\nI propose that we buy $20,000 worth of RGT evenly over the next 5 days (upon approval of this RIP) to accumulate RGT in our standard treasury before upgrading to a Smart Treasury later this quarter. \n\nThere is currently $53,148.14. in the treasury. We can expect a large amount of the funds to be used for upcoming audits, so it is safe to use this specified amount to slowly buy RGT off the market and hold it in a place that can capitalize and grow from the value of this token and its use cases.\n\n**Motivation:**\nThese investments from the treasury will bring RGT back to its roots for future contributions and also deploys more capital into the Rari protocol to earn yield.",

      "content": "Rationale: Offer a better and more useful product that would naturally create TVL before pandering to future mercenary farmers at the expense of current token holders.  \n\nA. Implement RGT tokenomics: Fee discount for farming on staking x amount of RGT. Amount of discount should be quadratically related to amount of staked RGT - ie the first 20% discount could potentially be 100 RGT, a full discount of fees would require 100000 RGT, scaling up exponentially in between.\nB. Remove burn, fees go towards a project treasury to be shared between stakers of RGT, paying team members a \"salary\", and potential future RGT incentives for certain strategies (without dilution).\nC. Staking RGT requires locking RGT in a contract for a set time period, this would be required to be able to vote in governance or claim staking rewards.\nD. Allow the public/market to create strategies on Rari between \"trusted\" lending platforms (starting with just Aave and Compound). Governance can vote on more \"trusted\" platforms as time goes on. With just Aave and Compound, for example, obvious strategies would be 0x or wBTC, the strategy would simply allocate to the higher of interest rates on Compound or Aave until deposit rates reach parity.",

      "content": "Summary:\nCreating a Smart Treasury that leverages a buyback and make model instead of buyback and burn to provide more lasting ecosystem benefits. \n\nBackground:\nAs many have noticed, buyback and burns have proven absolutely ineffective (see Placeholder‚Äôs piece on Smart Treasuries here: https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/9/17/stop-burning-tokens-buyback-and-make-instead). They provide no actual value to token holders and the scarcity meme seems to be limited to Bitcoin. For these reasons, I propose to create a Smart Treasury as an alternative. \n\nAbstract:\nI propose that we create a new treasury, The Rari Smart Treasury: A treasury built on Balancer that is used for earnings into the Rari ecosystem and autonomously rebalances to optimize for pool allocations. \n\nThis accumulates value into a diverse treasury instead of just burning it. \nThe treasury will be managed by the DAO, or rather, the token holders. They can choose to deploy the capital wherever they see fit, however, the mission of the treasuries will be to: \n- Increase the yield delivered by the Rari Protocol\n- Increase the TVL within the Rari Protocol\n- Increase safety of the Rari Protocol\n- Increase the size of the treasuries\n\nThe treasury could later invest in various funds (like what YAM is doing). I foresee a future where the treasury allocates to partner protocols in addition to holding assets like DPI. With the Melon ecosystem on our side, there are a series of fund managers that we could support with the capital within.\n\nThe treasury will be built as a Balancer Pool with the following details: \n- Starting pool: 80% - 10% - 10%: rgt - usdc - eth\n- Eventual transition: 80% - 10% - 10%: rgt - rspt - rept\n- Pool fees: 10% \n- CanChangeSwapFee: True\n- CanChangeWeights: True\n- MinimumGradualUpdateDurationForSwapFee: 3 days\n- CanChangeTokens: True\n- AddTokenLockTime: 3 days\n\nThe Smart Treasury will act as a replacement for the buyback and burn as it delivers similar purposes as I outlined in a previous forum post: https://forums.rari.capital/d/12-switch-from-buyback-and-burn-to-rari-smart-pool \n\nMotivation:\nAs incoming RGT from emissions into the Smart Treasury would result in price dilution. The creation of the Smart Treasury will enable us to deploy and invest the protocol's holdings in an intelligent way that will be used to indirectly accrue value towards the RGT. With the buyback and burn structure, we are consistently losing assets which could be better utilized in favor of the protocol.",

      "title": "[RIP-3] New Fee Structure",
      "content": "Summary:\nThis proposal aims to revise the current fees to optimize for our performance and introduce a new fee structure to optimize for maximum developer and protocol retention. \n\nBackground:\nThe Rari Protocol is optimizing for the wrong things, in this case, withdrawals. Additionally, it doesn‚Äôt allocate earnings properly. Lastly, it doesn‚Äôt set us up for long-term success. For reference, Yearn (a similar yield aggregator) charges fees on a 2/20 basis. \n\nAbstract:\nThis proposal aims to solve the aforementioned issues. \n\nOld fees: \nStable Pool: 9.5% profits + 0.5% withdrawal\nYield Pool: 9.5% profits + 0.5% withdrawal \nETH Pool: 9.5% profits \n\nProposed fees:\nStable Pool: 17.5% profits\nYield Pool: 12.5% profits + time-based withdrawal \nWithdrawal fee: 2% at 0 hours ‚Üí 1% at 1 week ‚Üí 0.5% at 1 month ‚Üí 0% after another month\nThe withdrawal fee is required to prevent arbitrage within this pool since it is composed of various stablecoins which may have minor price fluctuations \nETH Pool: 17.5% of profits \n\nThis removes the withdrawal fee from the stable pool, further aligning us with our users. The reason for the increase in fees across the board is to offset the lost earnings from a withdrawal fee. Additionally, even with these numbers it places us in a competitive state to similar yield aggregation products. \n\nAs mentioned, I believe that we are not allocating earnings properly. Below, I propose a new plan for how we should be allocating them: \n\nOld fee structure:\n50% Rari charity\n50% Buyback and burn\n\nProposed fee structure:\n45% Smart treasury (if RIP-5 is passed (or a derivative of it), if not, community treasury)\n15% Community treasury\n33.33% Developer who created strategy\nFee share is halved each $1m earned (taking value of fees at the time of payment) until fee share equals 8.16%. The remainder is forwarded to the Community Treasury. \n6.66% Staking (if RIP-4 is passed (or a derivative of it), if not, to the developer)\n\nIf RIP-4 or RIP-5 or a derivative of it are later added, they will be implemented into the fees as part of this proposal. \n\nMotivation:\nThe smart treasury serves a similar function as the buyback and burn with the major difference being that it accrues value for the ecosystem instead of offering a useless burn. Furthermore, I introduce a new method that will enable stakers to earn a piece of the fees. This is outlined in the Staking Mechanism proposal (RIP-4). This will ensure protocol retention amongst our users. \n\nMost importantly, there is a large portion being given to the developer who creates the strategy as this will help attract the best talent into the protocol, as we are rewarding them the best compensation. This will create a strong ecosystem around the Rari Protocol that can be later monetized with RIP-6 and the Incubation program. \n\nThis sets us up for long term success by deploying capital efficiently and ensuring we attract the best developers to our side.

Once RIP-1 funds start to be used, they may be emitted at a lower rate than in the proposal. The numbers from RIP-1 give the protocol an upper bound, but the goal will always be to minimize their use while maximizing benefit, and their existence merely ensures firepower should the DAO need it, and not an intention to use all the funds.*\n\nSummary:\nMint the amount of tokens that have been burned for pool2 rewards (liquidity mining the RGT-ETH pair on Uniswap) to increase liquidity across the ecosystem. \n\nBackground:\nLiquidity is necessary in order to get listed on various platforms: centralized exchanges, money markets and a lot more. This proposal aims to increase liquidity through the use of smart liquidity mining on the RGT-ETH pair on Uniswap. This proposal is independent of RIP-1. \n\nAbstract:\nA fellow Rari Forum user (linked here: https://forums.rari.capital/d/18-liquidity-provider-incentives-as-mining-ends) proposed an idea that would mint more tokens (the difference from what has been burned), 555,000 $RGT (at the time of writing) to offer as an incentive to people who enter as an LP into RGT-ETH on Uniswap. \n\nI propose for us to take this token difference and mint the difference in tokens to incentivize liquidity across the next three years on the following schedule:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1scL-iG6j7ywc6Clm5hJY1guvZqL8bF_3jPCkNR75QUk/edit?usp=sharing \n\nThis rewards early liquidity but also does not favor it too much, rewarding early adopters but ensuring that everyone is compensated for their contributions for the next few years. \n\nAt a later date, governance can vote for the rewards to be switched from RGT-ETH to RGT-REPT. We cannot do this at this time without putting LP‚Äôs at risk for significant arbitrage. \n\nMotivation:\n$RGT needs more liquidity, which would pave the way to getting listed on exchanges and money markets.

      "title": "RIP-1: Update Emissions Schedule",
      "content": "Summary:\nUpdate an emissions schedule to bootstrap a treasury and create a long-term liquidity mining program to ensure that the protocol can stay relevant and competitive.\n\nBackground:\nThe initial Rari Liquidity Mining program was developed to attract liquidity and strive towards decentralization. With the 10m $RGT all having been distributed, there are no more incentives on any behalf. I see value in having long-term issuance that delivers value towards token holders, developers and each party within the Rari Ecosystem. I have no intention of ever writing any more emissions plans beyond this one and am unlikely to support any future inflationary events. \n\nAbstract:\nMy proposed emissions plan lasts 2.5 years and proposes the creation of 10,000,000 new $RGT. The new tokens will go to two distinct places: the Community Treasury and Liquidity Incentives. 70% of the new supply will be used to bootstrap the Rari Community Treasury (managed by the DAO of token holders) whereas the next 30% will be used for liquidity initiatives.\n\nDistribution:\n70% - Community Treasury\n--> 20% - Rari Capital\n--> 50% - Remaining\n\n30% - Liquidity Initiatives\n--> 7.5% - First Year Liquidity Program\n--> 22.5% - Remaining\n\nThe Community Treasury will be built with the mission: to further the Rari Protocol on all fronts. The pursuit of these goals will be facilitated by the DAO, or rather, token holders.\n\nThis proposal also aims to allocate 2,000,000 $RGT of the Treasury to the Rari Capital team to continue as a lead developer of the protocol. This 28.57% of the Treasury will be delivered to the Rari Capital team on a quarterly basis for the next 2.5 years following the same rate of emissions (40% in the first year, 33% in the second year, etc). Since it is being delivered on a quarterly basis, governance can stop the spend at any time if they deem that the Rari Capital team is not justifying their value. The Rari Capital team is expected to continue their work on various fronts: creating new strategies, pushing governance forward and accruing value towards the ecosystem. The rest of the assets in the Treasury is at governance‚Äôs discretion for deployment.\n\nThe Liquidity Initiatives program will be built to increase liquidity of the Rari Tokens and further incentivize deposits within the platform. \n\nI propose for 750,000 $RGT to be taken from within the Liquidity Initiatives program to be deployed in the First Year Liquidity Program. This directs incentives for: basic depositors and stakers. Depositors will be eligible to earn 33.33% of the First Year Liquidity Program rewards. These will reward depositors for entering into any of the pools (based on fiat amount proportional to TVL), similar to the previous Liquidity Mining program. The staking rewards will be 66.66% of the 750,000. These staking rewards are incentives for locking RGT and UNI-LP: RGT-ETH. If no relevant staking proposals pass, the portion delegated to staking will be merged into the basic deposit rewards, then representing 100% of the initiative. This program will last twelve months but may be renewed at governance‚Äôs discretion. You can visualize this on the distribution attached on Google Sheets. \n\nWe begin with 40% of the new supply being distributed across the first year but the rate of increase slows down after the first year. We feel that there is value in decreasing emissions over the years. It is important to understand how this affects the token distribution as it stays true to our effort of having a community-owned protocol. The original founding team is getting diluted along with everyone else while the new Rari Capital team will begin maintaining the rest of the protocol. A large advantage of the new voting system ensures that early participants don‚Äôt hoard all of the tokens and thus the voting power. \n\nYou can view all of the charts (for inflation and also how the distributions will be affected) and the relevant outlined here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tDHhf2oCUCJKUNrPJgFerEGePIJgVlfvjmtmOlhDf7I/edit#gid=0\n\nMotivation:\nIn crypto, emissions or rather inflation can be thought of as taboo, maybe because the central banks did such a horrible job with it. However, it can provide net value to the ecosystem as I believe it will here. It will be able to incentivize new users, promote protocol growth, and lay the foundation for the Rari Ecosystem, as managed by the DAO.\n\nThe long-term emissions schedule will be the start of the Rari Ecosystem by pioneering the Rari Community Treasury. This treasury will be deployed in ways to provide exponential returns to RGT holders through smart investments and by bootstrapping future supplemental protocols.\n\nContinue the conversation on the forum: https://forums.rari.capital/d/25-rip-1-discussion",
