      "title": "Proposal #49: Buy Pooly NFT (Time Sensitive)",
      "content": "Summary\n\nPooITogether is currently involved in a lawsuit and is performing fundraising by selling NFT’s to raise legal funds. I want to propose Tracer DAO allocating 0.1 Ethereum to purchase 1 pooly NFT being sold by PoolTogether. This would been to be done within the next week, and the sooner the better as over time the benefits obtained from this proposal may diminish or the opportunity may be gone altogether. If consensus cannot be reached in a timely manner we would need to abandon this proposal.\n\nThe Pooly minting page can be found here: https://mint.pooltogether.com/ 2\n\nFor 0.1 ethereum Tracer DAO could potentially see quite large benefits, increase web3 footprint, help to set legal precidents, and contribute at large to the web3 community. I think it would be a strong win-win and that includes financially.\nRationale\n\nMinting 1 Pooly NFT has several potential direct and indirect benefits to Tracer DAO which I will now outline:\n\n    It sets a legal precedent in crypto for the USA, which will be invaluable to us moving forward. In the legal system in the USA, the first cases basically set law moving forward for many years to come. If PoolTogether is unable to mount a sucessful legal defense it could open up other Web 3.0 applications such as Tracer to increased legal exposure.\n\n    There is a strong possibility of being whitelisted for lens, which a strong social media presence in web 3.0, which is going to be a net positive for Tracer DAO. We would be able to to increase our social footprint, and since lens is on web 3.0 as oppose to say twitter on web 2.0 our target audience would be present in larger numbers (or maybe more concentrated is the right way to say this).\n\n    Possibility of unforeseen benefits like airdrops, inclusion in protocols, which cannot be counted on or anticipated but are likely none the less. Other than the 2 lens snapshots that have already happened (with more likely to occur) other protocols have started to involve pooly NFT holders. https://twitter.com/0xLazaros/status/1534515104049467392?s=20&t=Vcnd8E7yDr9qe8z8mo0a8g 2\n    It is quite possible that post mint that Tracer MAY actually profit quite a bit off of this, whether it be through social platform exposure, direct airdrops, inclusion in events, or other unforeseen benefits.\n\n    The Pooly NFT itself does have intrinsic value so even if everything else was a wash the NFT currently does sell for 90% of its minting cost on Opensea. While this is likely to change, NFTs are somewhat unpredictable and a pooly NFT could become far more or less valuable in the future.\n\nDeliverables\n\nIf passed, Tracer DAO would be participating in the greater Defi/Crypto ecosystem at large, protecting their own legal future interests, possibly reap financial benefits, and likely reap social benefits.\nVariation and Termination\n\nWhile the act of Minting the Pooly NFT cannot be reversed, the Pooly NFT could be sold in the future if so desired by Tracer DAO.\nConflicts of Interest\n\nThere is not current conflict of interest known to me, and it would seem to actually align with our best interest.\n\nPersonal disclosure: I own a pooly NFT.\nInterpretation\n\nUnless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by an Authorised Representative of the DAO, all terms that are defined pursuant to the Participation Agreement will retain its meaning.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, others may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.",

      "content": "Discourse [link](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-46-new-sol-avax-market-creation/1165)\n## Summary\nTracer’s Perpetual Pools can support a range of exciting markets. And with the current sentiment changing around “the merge\" of Ethereum, the vulnerabilities of other alternative-layer-1-blockchains, and the shortfallings around speed and cost, we should allow the market to manage their exposure. Tracer should provide a 3x leveraged SOL/ETH and a 3x leveraged AVAX/ETH. With the recent Perpetual Pools v2 launching, there are a lot fewer markets available, and these would be a great demonstration of how the reduced volatility decay can enable people to manage their exposure longer-term without risk of liquidation. It appears that there is a SOL Chainlink [price feed](https://data.chain.link/arbitrum/mainnet/crypto-usd/sol-usd) on Arbitrum, but not an AVAX feed yet. No doubt it will be available soon.\n\nIf this proposal is successful, the SOL/ETH and AVAX/ETH markets would be settled in USDC for 3x-L/S.\n\n## Execution\nChainlink offers a SOL/USD Oracle and the ETH/USD Oracle on Arbitrum. Taking these can build the SOL/ETH market. Without jumping too far ahead of \"The Voyage rollout, if the Tracer team can launch the SOL/ETH and AVAX/ETH markets, I am willing to seed liquidity into the Pools, to encourage more people to participate. I am a big supporter of Tracer and hold a bullish TCR position. “Deploy New Pool” isn’t currently activated on the [Pools interface](https://pools.tracer.finance/). Will be exciting to see people interact with the Tracer Factory soon, so that they might create markets independently. If the Tracer Discourse community is open to adding these SOL/ETH and AVAX/ETH Perpetual Pools, we should move to a Snapshot vote.\n\n## Interpretation\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, others may formally document aspects of this Proposal.\n\n## Copyright Waiver\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0]",

      "title": "Proposal #48: Perpetual Pools V2.1 Deploy",
      "content": "Discourse [link](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-48-perpetual-pools-v2-1-deploy/1172)\n## Summary\nPerpetual Pools V2 was deployed on May 19, 2022 with a new SMA (Simple Moving Average) pricing mechanism to reduce the effects of volatility decay (see [Proposal #47](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-47-launch-of-perpetual-pools-v2/1167)). SMA pricing uses an oracle wrapper that averages the spot price of the underlying asset over a period of time. The two pools that were deployed on May 19 use an 8-period SMA, meaning commits executed at time = T use an oracle wrapper that averages 8 spot prices, since T-8 hours.\n\nThe intended behaviour is a new datapoint is added to the SMA set of prices at every pool upkeep. A week after launch, it came to our attention that the SMA datapoints and pool upkeeps are not in sync. Rather than the SMA averaging 8 spot prices since T-8, the bug causes the SMA to average 8 spot prices ranging from the last 8-16 hours, making it more difficult to estimate the resultant index price.\n\nA deployment of Perpetual Pools V2.1 is required to patch the fix. The new features of V2.1 are detailed below.\n\n## New Features\nPerpetual Pools V2.1 will include the following updates:\n\n#### 1. New logic to handle multiple pending upkeeps. \nTo ensure the SMA datapoints align with the pool upkeeps, the mechanism to handle multiple pending upkeeps has been modified. When all upkeeps are completed, the next due upkeep is based on block.timestamp which aligns with the upcoming SMA update, rather than a calculated value which is being used in V2.0. This is an update of the [PoolComitter.sol](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/perpetual-pools-contracts/blob/pools-v2/contracts/implementation/PoolCommitter.sol) contract. Read more about the update [here](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/477).\n#### 2. Fee required to deploy new index feed and new pools. \nTo date, TCR has acted purely as a governance token. However, several upgrades have been identified that aim to give the TCR token greater utility. The first upgrade introduces a fee to deploy new indices and pools using the Tracer Factory. The fee amount is controlled and modifiable via governance. We propose that the initial fee amount should be set to 5,000 TCR (worth approximately US$250 at time of writing). This is an update of the [PoolFactory.sol](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/perpetual-pools-contracts/blob/pools-v2/contracts/implementation/PoolFactory.sol) contract. Read more about the update [here](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/perpetual-pools-contracts/pull/480).\n\nIf this proposal succeeds, Tracer DAO will install Tracer Perpetual Pools V2.1 in the Tracer Factory, to reflect the features described above. Perpetual Pools V2.0 will continue to exist, however Tracer DAO will not commit to servicing V2.0 markets with market making agreements, liquidity mining incentives, pool token staking rewards or future skew farm vault products.\n\n## Liquidity Mining\nThe liquidity mining strategy for Perpetual Pools V2.1 will remain same as outlined in Proposal #47 however if this proposal is successful, emissions will cease for V2.0. Emissions will be established for V2.1 and new Balancer pools will be established using Pool Tokens from Perpetual Pools V2.1.\n\n## Deliverables\nIf this proposal is successful:\n\n1. Perpetual Pools V2.1 will be deployed to include the new features described above, and;\n2. Liquidity Mining rewards will be redirected to incentivise new V2.1 markets.\n\n## Variation and Termination\nThis Proposal may be terminated or varied by future Proposals approved by the DAO.\n\n## Interpretation\nUnless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by an Authorised Representative of the DAO, all terms that are defined pursuant to the Participation Agreement will retain its meaning.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, Mycelium may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\nThe following definitions shall apply in this Proposal:\n\n## Definitions\n#### Commencement Date: \nthe date this Proposal is passed on chain and is signed.\n\n#### Tracer DAO: \nA decentralised autonomous organisation for Tracer, an open-sourced blockchain-based financial protocol.\n\n#### TCR Token or TCR: \nA measure of voting power in the Tracer DAO that attaches to a specific Wallet Address, whereby the greater amount of TCR Tokens a person holds in that Wallet Address, the greater the person’s voting power.\n\n#### Related Party: \nMeans, but is not limited to, the Service Provider’s parent company, subsidiary, affiliate, assignee, transferee or one of their representatives, principals, agents, directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors, members, shareholders or guarantors.\n\n## Copyright Waiver\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": "Proposal #47: Launch of Perpetual Pools V2",
      "content": "Discourse [link](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-47-launch-of-perpetual-pools-v2/1167#summary-1).\n\n## Summary\nThe launch of Tracer Perpetual Pools V2.\n\nPerpetual Pools V1 contracts have been enabling individuals to efficiently manage risk on Arbitrum for over 5 months now. In that time, tracer has hit some significant milestones such as:\n\nover $750 million in volume of leverage tokens traded; and\nupwards of $50 million USDC secured across the offered markets.\nTo continue this momentum, Perpetual Pools V2 aims to vastly improve the amount of flexibility users have to deploy financial products that combat emerging risks. This is especially prudent given the current international economic uncertainty. The Tracer DAO members (including existing Service Providers, [Strategic Partners](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-11-strategic-treasury-diversification/286) and [Academic Advisors](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-5-rmit-bih-research-collaboration-governance/127)) have been working tirelessly to perfect the Perpetual Pools V2 financial contract and it is finally time to bring it to market.\n\n## New Features\nTo deliver on this promise of increased flexibility, Perpetual Pools V2 will include the following features:\n\n#### 1. Long-term leverage with minimised volatility decay: \nFrom a mechanism level, the most prominent thing we will be introducing is SMA (Simple Moving Average) pricing - which will significantly reduce the effects of volatility decay. This will allow users to hold these fungible, leveraged tokens long-term without fear of liquidation. Additionally, a Minting Fee will be introduced 2 days after a Perpetual Pools market is deployed. This Minting Fee will be distributed to existing Pool participants and is intended to further reduce volatility decay.\n#### 2. No more minimum commitments required to mint new Pool tokens: \nIn v1, there is a minimum commit size of 1000 USDC into the pools to avoid DOS attacks. In V2, we propose batching commits to mint (burn) for a given rebalancing event. By doing this, the system can have no minimum commit size, while also being robust to DOS attacks.\n#### 3. New permissionless market deployment: \nTracer DAO believes in free markets and allowing market access to all users. The only barrier to accessing Tracer markets should be an internet connection. Tracer’s vision is to create novel derivative products and let anyone interact with them. In V2, anyone will be able to permissionlessly deploy a spot, or SMA-based market.\n#### 4. Tracer Indices: \nIn V2, there is going to be an influx of new markets. Not just any markets, but markets that track novel price feeds. This is where Tracer Indices comes in. Tracer Indices is creating novel price indices that can be plugged into markets, and allow users to gain leveraged exposure to any price feed. The first index that will be launched will be a value weighted index of ETH/BTC/LINK. Further down the track, we will also launch a novel cryptopunks index feed.\n#### 5. Increase the Transaction Fee from 1% to 2% of TVL: \nThe current transaction fee for Perpetual Pools is a 1% annual fee of TVL. Given the unique nature of the product in the market and as it gains broader adoption, increasing transaction fees to the DAO Treasury to 2% will increase the sustainability of the Tracer Protocol.\n\nIf this proposal succeeds, Tracer DAO will install Tracer Perpetual Pools V2 in the Tracer Factory.\n\n## Liquidity Mining\nV2 will launch with an emissions campaign to attract liquidity in separate markets. The amount of emissions will be determined immediately prior to launch of V2 based on the price of TCR.\n\nTCR rewards for the V2 campaign will come from the residual of the 100,000,000 TCR (10% of total TCR Supply) initially made available to incentivise V1 markets, pursuant to [proposal #20](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-20-tracer-perpetual-pools-and-liquidity-mining/463). At the date of this proposal, there is approximately 60,000,000 (~60%) of that circulating TCR supply still available. Upon the launch of V2, the V1 staking contracts will no longer earn TCR incentives and the TCR rewards will be redirected to the new v2 markets.\n\nFor V2 Perpetual Pool markets, Tracer Pool stakers will be be able earn rewards by staking PP tokens on the Tracer [Stake](https://pools.tracer.finance/stake/) page or Tracer Pools stakers can stake their Pool tokens on Balancer and earn TCR LM incentives directly through Balancer by staking relevant Balancer LP tokens on Balancer. The TCR incentives on Balancer are meant to encourage secondary liquidity of Perp Pool tokens given the extended mint/burn period of 8 hours.\n\n#### In summary\nLiquidity mining for V2 will have the following features:\n\n1. Incentives will be redirected from V1 markets to V2 launch markets\n2. All emissions will come from the [V1 allocation of TCR](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-20-tracer-perpetual-pools-and-liquidity-mining/463) for liquidity mining - of which approximately 60,000,000 TCR is available\n\n## Deliverables\nIf this proposal is successful:\n\n1. the Tracer Perpetual Pools V2 contract will be installed in the Tracer Factory, and;\n2. Liquidity Mining rewards will be redirected to incentivise new V2 markets as outlined above.\n\n## Variation and Termination\nThis Proposal may be terminated or varied by future Proposals approved by the DAO.\n\n## Interpretation\nUnless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by an Authorised Representative of the DAO, all terms that are defined pursuant to the Participation Agreement will retain its meaning.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, Mycelium may provide more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\nThe following definitions shall apply in this Proposal:\n\n## Definitions\n#### Commencement Date:\nthe date this Proposal is passed on chain and is signed.\n\n#### Tracer DAO: \nA decentralised autonomous organisation for Tracer, an open-sourced blockchain-based financial protocol.\n\n#### TCR Token or TCR: \nA measure of voting power in the Tracer DAO that attaches to a specific Wallet Address, whereby the greater amount of TCR Tokens a person holds in that Wallet Address, the greater the person’s voting power.\n\n#### Related Party: \nMeans, but is not limited to, the Service Provider’s parent company, subsidiary, affiliate, assignee, transferee or one of their representatives, principals, agents, directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors, members, shareholders or guarantors.\n\n## Copyright Waiver\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to CC0.",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nDiscourse link: [**here**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-45-update-to-myceliums-offer-4/1125)\n\nMycelium ([formerly known as Lion’s Mane](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/lions-mane-rebranding/296)) posted an [offer](https://github.com/lions-mane/tracer-dao/blob/lionsmane-proposal/proposals/LionsmaneProposal.md) to perform certain services for Tracer DAO, which was accepted, via Proposal and vote, by Tracer DAO on 10 February 2021. Subsequent amendments to Mycelium’s terms of engagement were passed on [15, July 2021](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-12-update-to-myceliums-offer/316), [1 November, 2021](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/0x189105a6518fb0802b3181c36baf49541b2bdd699ab2175cffc6ec81187c177a), and [19 February, 2022](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/0xf4b9423d1d8a6d4182b4669dd14f58deef6f4721590f941d0d33bd1b5293c98a) to increase Mycelium’s monthly service budget to its current level of $650,000 per month.\n\nThese amendments were requested in part as reimbursement for pre-paid expenses on behalf of the DAO and in part in anticipation of forward looking expenses as part of Tracer’s growth map. Since the most recent amendment in February, the Tracer DAO team has been augmented by three new smart contract developers and a number of community contributors across its Business Development, Marketing, Design, UX/UI and Engineering verticals. \n\nAs a result of judicious budgeting and planning, we were ultimately able to onboard these additional resources without a significant increase to our spending and thus propose to decrease the DAO’s monthly service back to its previous level of USD$500,000 per month.\n\nWe are currently finalising Mycelium's Q4 2021 & Q1 2022 report to Tracer DAO and will publish it in Discourse.\n\n---\n# Updates\n\nIn accordance with the Proposal engaging Mycelium, and to assist Mycelium to execute upon these strategic goals, Mycelium requests:\n\n1. The current remuneration of USD$650,000.00 (or equivalent) per month (or part thereof) is decreased to USD$500,000.00 (or equivalent) per month (or part thereof) starting on the day that a Proposal implementing this Proposal is executed and ending when Mycelium is no longer engaged by the DAO, to be paid on the last day of each calendar month. If a payment does not occur because the DAO has insufficient funds, the amount of that payment will accrue and be paid to Mycelium when the DAO has sufficient funds to pay for that calendar month.\n\nIt is expected that all other aspects of Mycelium’s engagement, detailed in the Proposal passed on [12 February 2021](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/tracer-dao/blob/master/proposals/LionsmaneProposal.md), including amendments made on [12 July 2021](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-12-update-to-myceliums-offer/316) and [28 October 2021](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-28-update-to-myceliums-offer-2/619) will remain the same.\n\n----\n## Next Steps\n\nIn order for this proposal to take effect, it must be pushed to Snapshot DAO members and that Proposal must succeed.\n\nWe encourage the discussion of this proposal in the comments below.\n\n\n---\n# Deliverables and Commitments\n\nIf this proposal succeeds, Mycelium’s Deliverables and Commitments, as outlined in the Proposal passed on [10 February 2021](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/tracer-dao/blob/master/proposals/LionsmaneProposal.md) as well as the updated proposals passed on [14 July 2021,](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-12-update-to-myceliums-offer/316) [1 November 2021](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-28-update-to-myceliums-offer-2/619) and [19 February 2022](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/0xf4b9423d1d8a6d4182b4669dd14f58deef6f4721590f941d0d33bd1b5293c98a), will remain the same.\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. Mycelium acknowledges that, if engaged, the DAO may terminate or vary its engagement in accordance with:\n    1. future Proposals and performance;\n    2. the Deliverables specified above;\n    3. a material breach of any term of the Agreement which breach is not capable of being remedied or (if such a breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach within 10 days of receipt of notice from the DAO in writing to do so; and\n    4. any repeated breaches of the terms of the agreement in such a manner as to reasonably justify the opinion that its conduct is inconsistent with it having the intention or ability to give effect to the terms of this agreement.\n\nTermination of the Proposal shall not affect any of the parties’ rights and remedies that have accrued as at the date of termination. Furthermore, any termination of this agreement shall not e effective unless the agreement either expires, all things required to be done by the Proposal are completed or it is terminated by a further proposal of the DAO.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer Project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nMycelium wishes to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1.

      "content": "# Summary\n\nDiscourse link: [**here**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/accepting-balancer-lp-tokens-for-governance/1091)\n\nThe primary use case for the TCR token is currently governance, where possible the aim should be to include as many TCR holders as possible. Currently Tracer DAO governance (executed through [snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth](http://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth)) accepts votes from;\n\n* TCR\n* tTCR\n* Unstaked TCR\n* Arbitrum TCR\n\nBalancer and other LP tokens are currently not included resulting in Arbitrum TCR holders deciding between participating in governance or using their TCR to earn. There is currently no way for an Arbitrum TCR holder to participate in governance and earn.\n\nThe high gas fees on Ethereum has resulted in many new or smaller crypto holders no longer being able to transact on Ethereum mainnet. Layer 2s such as Arbitrum are growing in applications, users and volume. More liquidity on AMMs such as Balancer will be needed to support this growth.\n\nWith Balancers 80%TCR - 20%WETH pool, LP providers are showing clear intent to hold TCR with a long term view. LP providers in the B-80TCR-20WETH incentives are aligned with all other TCR holders.\n\nBankless DAO has recently approved to extend their [partnership](https://snapshot.org/#/banklessvault.eth/proposal/QmU1Rz7s87ow29QsfeCee7j2jr7H9h6BFkoPmVu6Ux56XD) with Balancer, RSA and David Hoffman are [strategic advisors](https://vote.tracer.finance/?pk_vid=0d1b5a330eeda3d21645256839c32621#/proposal/QmVK3boGUXF5K72EB8pXB5Znf5a9EEGBnAt5pmWBtLR9KW) and TCR frequently appears on the Bankless podcast. Allowing TCR Arbitrum users to participate in providing liquidity while also voting in a DAO is a great way to demonstrate to new users the power and opportunity of DeFi. Further aligning TCR values with Bankless and the Bankless DAO.\n\nAs mentioned in [Proposal #36](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-36-accepting-ttcr-arbitrum-tcr-and-unstaked-tcr-for-governance/978), “In other DAO protocols, local governance token holders are incentivised to stake their tokens within the local protocol to receive rewards (%APR in governance token) purely for staking to vote. This function rewards governance token holders in return for little utility to the DAO (liquidity locked + paying for people to vote)\". Providing as many people the opportunity to earn while holding TCR will reduce the community pressure to offer staking incentives for governance.\n\nBy allowing Balancer LP tokens to vote we are achieve\n\n* Encouraging greater participation governance\n* Allowing TCR holder to generate additional value\n* Adding liquidity to L2\n* Reducing the need for the DAO to offer staking\n\nAt the moment of writing there are 238 addresses holding 404,698 B-80TCR-20WETH tokens which equates to 323,758 TCR.\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\nIf this proposal is successfully passed, the following deliverables will be provided:\n\n1. **B-80TCR-20WETH** tokens (only the equivalent TCR amount will be acceptable to vote) will be able to be used to propose and vote on proposals in Tracer DAO’s governance process on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth).

      "title": "Proposal #44: Treasury Investment whitelist: BAL",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nDiscourse link: [**here**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/treasury-investment-whitelist-bal/1104)\n\nAs per the remit of the [Treasury Management Fund](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-40-treasury-management-fund-functional-sub-dao/1046), decisions made on “whitelisting investable tokens (non-stable)” must be approved via Governance Proposal to the DAO. If successful, this proposal will whitelist BAL as an investable token for the Treasury Mangaement Fund.\n\nA [Balancer proposal](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512) was recently published within their forum to deploy a ‘vote escrow’ or ‘veBAL’ model for their local governance token. For Tracer’s Perpetual Pool v1 product, minters of Perpetual Pool tokens were incentivised to stake their tokens on Balancer to provide secondary market liquidity. Balancer will be looked to be used again to provide secondary market liquidity for the Perpetual Pools v2 product once it is launched.\n\nIn preparation for Balancer’s ‘ve’ model, this proposal will whitelist BAL in the Treasury Management Fund for the following reasons:\n\n1.  Strengthen Tracer DAO’s long-term strategic partnership with Balancer; and\n2. Allow the Treasury Management Fund to vote for BAL emissions to be directed towards Tracer’s Perpetual Pools v2 markets that are staked on Balancer.\n\nIf this proposal is successful, the Treasury Management Fund will purchase a **relatively modest but meaningful amount** to fulfil the purpose of providing incentives to unlock secondary market liquidity for Perpetual Pools v2. The strategy to execute the exact amount/s and timing of the purchasing event/s will be up to the discretion of the Treasury Management Council for optimal efficiency to mitigate against any execution risks including slippage and front-running.\n\nAdditional BAL that is earned by the Treasury Management Fund will be strategically used under the direction of the Treasury Management Council as per its remit (including being used as additional voting power to direct more BAL emissions).\n\nTotal traded volume of v1 Perpetual Pool tokens on Balancer to date: **$111,775,026 USDC.**\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\nIf this proposal is successful, the following deliverables will be executed:\n\n1. BAL will become ‘whitelisted’ by the Treasury Management Fund as an investable non-stable token; and\n2. A **relatively modest but meaningful amount** of BAL will be purchased up to the discretion of the Treasury Management Council.\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\nIf this proposal is successful, the DAO may terminate or vary its engagement in accordance with:\n\n1. future Proposals and performance; and\n2. the Deliverables specified above.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nThe following conflicts of interest are declared:\n\n1. No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n---\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by an Authorised Representative of the DAO, all terms that are defined pursuant to the Participation Agreement will retain its meaning.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, others may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\nThe following definitions shall apply in this Proposal:\n\n## Definitions\n\n**Commencement Date:** the date this Proposal is passed on chain and is signed.\n\n**Tracer DAO:** A decentralised autonomous organisation for Tracer, an open-sourced blockchain-based financial protocol.\n\n**TCR Token:** A measure of voting power in the Tracer DAO that attaches to a specific Wallet Address, whereby the greater amount of TCR Tokens a person holds in that Wallet Address, the greater the person’s voting power.\n\n**Related party:** Means, but is not limited to, the Service Provider’s parent company, subsidiary, affiliate, assignee, transferee or one of their representatives, principals, agents, directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors, members, shareholders or guarantors.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": "Proposal #42: Growth Fund Multisig member replacements",
      "content": "# Summary\nThe success of a DAO is defined not only by its core offering, but by its ability to coordinate and remunerate its advisors, service providers and contributors. \n\nAs Tracer DAO grows, so too does the demand on the [Growth Fund Managers](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385) to push through operational payments. As outlined in [Proposal #16](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385), these Growth Fund Managers play a vital role in ensuring that Tracer DAO can use its resources efficiently without being burdened by administrative proposals.\n\nAlthough most Growth Fund Members are actively involved in the Growth Fund multisig, the sheer volume of operational transactions that are being continuously lodged requires a reshuffle of backend responsibilities. In order to make administrative actions as efficient as possible, it is proposed that a multisig member be replaced with a team-member highly involved with the daily operational matters of Tracer DAO.\n\nIf this proposal is successful, Ashley Morgan (co-founder of Mycelium) will be replaced by Adam Bawi (founding/core contributor at Tracer DAO) as a member of the Growth Fund multisig and as a Growth Fund Manager. Additionally, Framework (Vance & Michael) will be replaced by Doo Wan Nam (Co-founder of Stable Node). Adam has dedicated himself to growing Tracer since genesis and has had responsibilities in Tracer’s Governance, Business Development and more importantly for this proposal, Operations. Doo Wan has been an unofficial advisor to Tracer DAO and is also a member of the ‘Maker Mafia’ who are a strategic partner to Tracer DAO. If successful, Adam and Doo Wan will become Growth Fund multisig members under the [same terms](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385) as the original Growth Fund Managers.\n\nAside from Ash and Framework, all other multisig members will remain the same and the decision-making process of Tracer DAO will remain in its current form, as decentralised and community driven through proposals. Importantly, the balanced nature of the Growth Fund multisig will remain as both Ash and Adam are both part of the wider Mycelium ecosystem.\n\n\n| Growth Fund Manager                        | ETH address                                |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Adam Bawi (Core Contributor) of Tracer DAO | 0x12FABFBFc1F15aE2F46f87DFD42e028E1D3Fbbbb |\n|Doo Wan Nam (Co-founder) of Stable Node | 0x2D5b6ccCa29B77AEB21D821De3B433F97fdeF29B |\n# Remuneration\n\nLike the current Growth Fund Managers, Adam and Doo Wan will not receive any remuneration for the provision of their services to the DAO in this function. \n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\nIf this Proposal is successful, Adam and Doo Wan will work with the other Growth Fund Managers to provide the following deliverables:\n\n1. A monthly update, via Discourse, including all activities conducted by the Managers; and\n2. Ensuring that the fund is effectively spent.\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. The Managers acknowledge that, if engaged, its engagement can be varied by future Proposals. For the avoidance of doubt, the engagement of certain members of the Managers can also be varied by future Proposals.\n2. The Managers expects that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the deliverables specified above. If the engagement of the Managers is terminated, all remaining tokens in the Growth Fund will be returned to Tracer DAO’s treasury.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nAdam and Doo Wan wish to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1. Adam is a current core contributor of Tracer DAO and holds TCR.\n2. Doo Wan is a part of the Maker Mafia who are strategic partners of Tracer DAO.\n\n---\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by an Authorised Representative of the DAO, all terms that are defined pursuant to the Participation Agreement will retain its meaning.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, others may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\nThe following definitions shall apply in this Proposal:\n\n## Definitions\n\n**Commencement Date:** The date this Proposal is passed on chain and is signed.\n\n**Growth Fund:** Means the growth fund established by [Proposal #16](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385).\n\n**Growth Fund Manager:** Has the meaning ascribed to that term in [Proposal #16](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385). \n\n**Tracer DAO:** A decentralised autonomous organisation for Tracer, an open-sourced blockchain-based financial protocol.\n\n**TCR Token:** A measure of voting power in the Tracer DAO that attaches to a specific Wallet Address, whereby the greater amount of TCR Tokens a person holds in that Wallet Address, the greater the person’s voting power.\n\n**Related party:** Means, but is not limited to, the Service Provider’s parent company, subsidiary, affiliate, assignee, transferee, or one of their representatives, principals, agents, directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors, members, shareholders, or guarantors.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nDiscourse link: [**here**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/update-to-myceliums-offer-3/1052)\n\nOn 27 January 2021, Mycelium ([formerly referred to as Lion’s Mane](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/lions-mane-rebranding/296)) posted [an offer on GitHub](https://github.com/lions-mane/tracer-dao/blob/lionsmane-proposal/proposals/LionsmaneProposal.md) to perform certain services for Tracer DAO. On 10 February 2021, that offer was accepted, via Proposal and vote, by Tracer DAO. On 14 July 2021, Mycelium's [updated offer](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-12-update-to-myceliums-offer/316) was accepted. On 1 November 2021, Mycelium’s 2nd [updated offer](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/0x189105a6518fb0802b3181c36baf49541b2bdd699ab2175cffc6ec81187c177a) was accepted.\n\nSince that time, the Tracer DAO has grown significantly, including the following key developments:\n\n1. Completion of a [second audit](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/QmTkTACcaozwYzdyJUq9oVLzvmjuaYehE7DQLBXTPZaEK1) of the Perpetual Pools codebase with Runtime Verification;\n2. Engaging major strategic advisors for Tracer DAO (to be announced after v2 launch);\n3. Reached $50M USDC TVL on the Perpetual Pools financial contract;\n4. Launched the first FX market on Perpetual Pools - EUR/USD; \n5. Launched additional markets on Perpetual Pools including TOKE/USDC & LINK/USDC;\n6. Launched the first alternative collateral market on Perpetual Pools - AAVE/USD (FRAX as collateral);\n7. Achieved a [DeFi Safety review](https://tracer.finance/radar/defi-safety-review) score of 85% - being listed amongst the top 25 most secured protocols that have been reviewed by DeFi safety;\n8. Engaged [Risk Harbor](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/0x7d451d1b9c942cd275bdbcbf3ceef55ec1a8bd249adb068ca9645c8816b1b092) to provide insurance protection for Perpetual Pools users;\n9. [Diamond Sponsorship](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/0xb758d4b4f52ccfc13f4a9cfbe5fe91a0e4c4a8b7a258663756eccf6066d67243) for Tracer DAO at Permissionless Conference 2022; and\n10. [MetaLite Sponsorship](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/0x91e4760209a95a3755ac719668a951b187c0a05587c3ffdf296defd3ab4d929c) for Tracer DAO at ETHDenver Conference 2022 (and after-party sponsorship).\n\nAs reported in [Mycelium’s third quarterly report](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/mycelium-dao-report-q3-2021/1026), Mycelium incurred U$586,679.92 in connection with its delivery of services from 31 July 2021 to 31 October 2021.\n\nAs per the forecast in quarter 3, it was expected that our costs for quarter 4 and Q1 2022 would significantly increase. Our costs have increased by approximately 20% compared to what was forecasted. Additionally, our cost forecast for Q1 2022 is estimated at approximately U$1.9m per quarter due to further resource allocation in the following areas:\n\n1. Software Development hires (4);\n2. Product Development hires (5);\n3. Business Development hires (3); and \n4. Ecosystem/Community hires (3).\n\nIn the coming months, we are looking to support the following strategic goals:\n\n1. Assisting Tracer DAO to Launch Perpetual Pools v2 financial contracts (and supporting versioning updates);\n2. Assisting Tracer DAO to launch a ‘skew farming’ vault to support the Perpetual Pools v2 contracts to minimise volatility decay; and\n3. Growing Tracer DAO’s decentralised working environment to fund more projects within the DAO that contribute to Tracer’s community, products, business development, design and engineering teams.\n\nWe are currently finalising Mycelium's Q4 2021 & Q1 2021 report to Tracer DAO and will publish it in the Discourse at the end of Q1 2022 as a combined report, incorporating the first quarter of 2022.\n\n---\n\n# Updates\n\nIn accordance with the Proposal engaging Mycelium, and to assist Mycelium to execute upon these strategic goals, Mycelium requests:\n\n1. The current remuneration of USD$500,000.00 (or equivalent) per month (or part thereof) is increased to USD$650,000.00 (or equivalent) per month (or part thereof) starting on the day that a Proposal implementing this Proposal is executed and ending when Mycelium is no longer engaged by the DAO, to be paid on the last day of each calendar month. If a payment does not occur because the DAO has insufficient funds, the amount of that payment will accrue and be paid to Mycelium when the DAO has sufficient funds to pay for that calendar month.\n\nIt is expected that all other aspects of Mycelium’s engagement, detailed in the Proposal passed on [12 February 2021](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/tracer-dao/blob/master/proposals/LionsmaneProposal.md), including amendments made on [12 July 2021](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-12-update-to-myceliums-offer/316) and [28 October 2021](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-28-update-to-myceliums-offer-2/619) will remain the same.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIn order for this proposal to take effect, it must be pushed to Snapshot DAO members and that Proposal must succeed.\n\nWe encourage the discussion of this proposal in the comments below.\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables and Commitments\n\nIf this proposal succeeds, Mycelium’s Deliverables and Commitments, as outlined in the Proposal passed on [10 February 2021](https://github.com/tracer-protocol/tracer-dao/blob/master/proposals/LionsmaneProposal.md) as well as the updated proposals passed on [14 July 2021](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-12-update-to-myceliums-offer/316) and [1 November 2021](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-28-update-to-myceliums-offer-2/619), will remain the same.\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. Mycelium acknowledges that, if engaged, the DAO may terminate or vary its engagement in accordance with:\n    1. future Proposals and performance;\n    2. the Deliverables specified above;\n    3. a material breach of any term of the Agreement which breach is not capable of being remedied or (if such a breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach within 10 days of receipt of notice from the DAO in writing to do so; and\n    4. any repeated breaches of the terms of the agreement in such a manner as to reasonably justify the opinion that its conduct is inconsistent with it having the intention or ability to give effect to the terms of this agreement.\n\nTermination of the Proposal shall not affect any of the parties’ rights and remedies that have accrued as at the date of termination. Furthermore, any termination of this agreement shall not e effective unless the agreement either expires, all things required to be done by the Proposal are completed or it is terminated by a further proposal of the DAO.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer Project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nMycelium wishes to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1. It is an existing Service Provider to Tracer DAO and holds TCR tokens.\n\n---\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by an Authorised Representative of the DAO, all terms that are defined pursuant to the Participation Agreement will retain their meaning.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, Mycelium may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\nThe following definitions shall apply in this Proposal:\n\n## Definitions\n\n**Commencement Date:** the date this Proposal is passed on chain and is signed.\n\n**Tracer DAO:** A decentralised autonomous organisation for Tracer, an open-sourced blockchain-based financial protocol.\n\n**TCR Token:** A measure of voting power in the Tracer DAO that attaches to a specific Wallet Address, whereby the greater amount of TCR Tokens a person holds in that Wallet Address, the greater the person’s voting power.\n\n**Related party: M**eans, but is not limited to, the Service Provider’s parent company, subsidiary, affiliate, assignee, transferee or one of their representatives, principals, agents, directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors, members, shareholders or guarantors.\n\n---\n\n# Indemnity\n\nMycelium shall keep the DAO fully indemnified against direct liabilities, costs, expenses, damages and losses suffered or incurred by the DAO as a direct result of:\n\n1. any claim against the DAO for actual or alleged infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights arising out of, or in connection with, the receipt, use or supply of the Deliverables, to the extent that the claim is attributable to the acts or omissions of Mycelium, its employees, agents or subcontractors; and\n2. any claim made against the DAO by a third party arising out of, or in connection with, the supply of the Deliverables, to the extent that such claim arises out of the breach, negligent performance or failure or delay in performance of the Proposal by the Mycelium, its employees, agents or subcontractors.\n\nMycelium provides no indemnity for indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation, product recall costs, and all interest, fines, penalties, and legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity basis) and any other professional costs and expenses.\n\nThis clause will survive termination of the Proposal.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights are waived pursuant to [CCO](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)",

      "title": "Proposal #40: Treasury Management Fund - functional sub-DAO",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nDiscourse link: [**here**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/treasury-management-fund-functional-sub-dao/1046)\n\nAs the state of the DAOs grow within the decentralised economy and operations become more complex, so too does the need for developing governance frameworks that allow for a delegation of authority to carry out certain DAO functions (and the acts incidental to it, usually accompany it, or are reasonably necessary to accomplish it) to specialists while ensuring that ultimate authority remains vested in the community. Treasury management is one such function. [Effective treasury management](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-daos-should-approach-treasury) is necessary to increase the economic runway for DAO projects, to ensure a DAO has the liquidity it needs to manage its day-to-day business and to enable a DAO to achieve its long-run strategies and objectives. Similarly to how the [Growth Fund](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385) was deployed for payments to Service Providers, Advisors, operational expenditures etc., the **Treasury Management Fund** will be used to deploy strategies to improve the Tracer DAO treasury’s financial position.\n\nThis proposal, if successful, will implement a **Treasury Management Framework** that establishes a ‘functional sub-DAO’ (the **Treasury Management Fund**) to be managed by the **Treasury Management Team** within a limited scope of authority and subject to the joint oversight of an investment committee (the **Treasury Management Council**) and the Tracer DAO community. The Treasury Management Team will be given the authority to deploy capital allocated to the Treasury Management Fund according to its community proscribed mandate in a manner that maximises capital efficiency and risk-adjusted growth.\n\n## Treasury Management Framework\n\nThis Treasury Management Framework Proposal seeks to create a **Treasury Management Fund** (TMF), to be established as a 3/5 multisig held by the (i) Treasury Management Team and (ii) two independent third-party signatories.  \n\nThe objective of the Treasury Management Fund shall be to:\n\n1. maintain a strong fiscal position for Tracer DAO operations;\n2. and, subject to that, to support the growth of Tracer DAO by maximising *risk-adjusted* returns and optimising capital efficiency.\n\nThe Treasury Management Fund will be managed by the **Treasury Management Team** subject to the oversight of the Treasury **Management Council**. Because Tracer is a community-led DAO, in all cases and at all times, the Treasury Management Fund (and related bodies) will operate in accordance with the Treasury Management Fund Remit (**TMF Remit**), as confirmed and amended, from time to time, by community vote. \n\n### Treasury Management Team\n\nThe following have been nominated to serve in the day-to-day management of the Treasury Management Fund:\n\n| Treasury Management Team member                   | ETH address                                |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Raymond (Co-founder) of Mycelium                  | 0x131ddFd1DC9133077C72800C60072374cF6C87Fb |\n| Dion Chu (core-contributor/advisor) of Tracer DAO | 0xA7c42330f96c158513c98B73989aE37aC8456fA5 |\n| Billy Welch (core-contributor) of Mycelium        | 0x6BCAbF9f00F5583d38c2F30eF31f03B6bD9C9A11 |\n\nCollectively, these parties would comprise the **Treasury Management Team** (TMT) and will serve a twelve (12) month term, subject to confirmation/renewal by the community. The Treasury Management Team will be responsible for monitoring the state of the DAO’s finances to ensure that the DAO has sufficient liquidity to meet its operational needs and manage the Treasury Management Fund to optimise risk-adjusted returns subject to the DAO’s operational needs and in a manner consistent with its community-proscribed mandate (**TMF Remit**). Each member of the Treasury Management Team will hold a key to the Treasury Management Fund multisig. \n\nThe following have been nominated to serve as independent third-party Treasury Management Fund signatories, who will serve a twelve (12) month term, subject to confirmation/renewal by the community:\n\n| Independent Signatories                    | ETH address                                |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Chris Berg (Co-founder) of RMIT BIH        | 0x219BaD06180F4024A06C372d754E882D175Df098 |\n| Sinclair Davidson (Co-founder) of RMIT BIH | 0x06187EAA4EF0891571F0a78a2DDEf0d291555E09 |\n\nCollectively, these parties will be referred to as the **Independent Signatories**. Each Independent Signatory will hold a key to the Treasury Management Fund multisig and be responsible for reviewing and approving Treasury Management Fund transactions in a timely manner. \n\n### Treasury Management Council\n\nThis proposal also seeks to establish a Treasury Management Council (TMC) comprised of the Treasury Management Team and two independent council members. The Treasury Management Council will have the authority to decide on certain Treasury Management Fund policies and matters that require a heightened level of scrutiny but fall short of requiring a full community vote. The members of the Treasury Management Council are appointed to twelve (12) month terms, subject to confirmation/renewal by the community. Decisions will be made by a simple majority.\n\nThe Treasury Management Council will be responsible for:\n\n1. reviewing and monitoring Treasury Management Fund performance;\n2. setting policies to mitigate risk (including, but not limited to strategy risk, market risk, smart contract risk, counterparty risk, legal risk, and token exposure risk); \n3. set and monitor risk limits and concentration limits; and \n4. whitelisting protocols and strategies available to the Treasury Management Fund, \n\nsubject in each case to its community-proscribed remit (**TMF Remit**). \n\nThe Treasury Management Council will also deliver a quarterly report, uploaded via Discourse, reporting on:\n\n1. the overall performance of the Treasury Management Fund;\n2. portfolio composition and risk assessment; and\n3. material changes to Treasury Management Fund policies.\n\nThe following have been nominated to serve as independent council members for a twelve (12) month term, subject to confirmation/renewal by the community:\n\n| Independent Signatories                    | ETH address                                |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Chris Berg (Co-founder) of RMIT BIH        | 0x219BaD06180F4024A06C372d754E882D175Df098 |\n| Sinclair Davidson (Co-founder) of RMIT BIH | 0x06187EAA4EF0891571F0a78a2DDEf0d291555E09 |\n\nCollectively, these parties will be referred to as the **Independent Council Members**. The Independent Council Members shall be available to meet and discuss policies as needed, attend Treasury Management Council quarterly review meetings, and approve the TMC quarterly report to the community.  \n\n### Treasury Management Fund Remit\n\nIf successful, this Proposal will implement the Treasury Management Framework described above, which includes the establishment of the Treasury Management Fund, and delegates authority to the Treasury Management Council and the Treasury Management Team to carry out the Treasury Management Framework objectives, subject to a **TMF Remit** as confirmed and amended, from time to time, by community vote. \n\nTo achieve this objective, this Proposal seeks the following remit (**TMF Remit V1**) to instate the Treasury Management Framework:\n\n1. **Scope of Remit** — The transfer of Tracer DAO’s [Visor LP position](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/QmYMCZuMx9LoW18xANofwBHyaPXHBDScjnBqy14hQNfvrV), 27,407 [tToke position](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/0xc1e49cb070262c710d69fed2cfdbeb399920e54519ee43adb74280c93ba07851), 42.55 ETH and 2.77 WBTC received in consideration for [proposal 14](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/QmXJXyfgcJoDXEuHxuZoGT5AqVTpwyBma73kCdfr72t6pf), 1,300,000 DAI (or other stablecoin), and 100,000,000 TCR to the Treasury Management Fund multisig to be deployed subject to the following constraints:\n    1. exposure to tokens (other than tokens transferred from Tracer DAO by this remit or received as staking or farming reward, or exposure arising from liquidity pools) will be limited to TCR and stablecoins approved by the Treasury Management Council;\n    2. concentration risk for each protocol will be limited to 33%, subject to more restrictive (but not expansionary) limits set by the Treasury Management Council; \n    3. maximum gross leverage ratios of 200% (across the fund as well as per position); and\n    4. all tokens to remain on Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum.\n2. The Treasury Management Council is directed to:\n    1. set policies and procedures to monitor and manage risk (including, but not limited to strategy risk, market risk, smart contract risk, counterparty risk, legal risk, and token exposure risk); \n    2. determine and whitelist acceptable strategies, vaults, farms, and protocols etc. subject to appropriate and reasonable risk assessments;\n    3. deliver a quarterly report, via Discourse, that provides a performance and risk assessment, as well updates on any material changes to risk guidelines and policies set by the Treasury Management Council;\n    \n    in each case, subject to the scope authorised in this remit.\n    \n3. The Treasury Management Team is directed to optimise capital efficiency and maximise risk-adjusted returns (and delegated authority to carry out the acts incidental to it, usually accompany it, or are reasonably necessary to accomplish it) subject to the policies and guidelines of the Treasury Management Council and the scope authorised in this remit. \n4. The Treasury Management Fund assets are at all times subject to redemption by Tracer DAO as needed for operational expenditures. Any funds so redeemed for may be remitted back the Treasury Management Fund without further proposal.\n\nThe Treasury Management Team and Treasury Management Council are directed to reference the table below for further guidance on the scope of authority authorised under this remit.\n\n| Decision | TMT | TMC | Governance Proposal |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Amendments to this framework | ------ | ------ | x |\n| Approve initial and any additional capital allocations to the Fund | ------ | ------ | x |\n| Whitelist investable tokens (non-stablecoin) | ------ | ------ | x |\n| Set maximum concentration/risk limits for each (non-stablecoin) investable token | ------ | ------ | x |\n| Approve L1s and L2s whitelisted for cross-chain bridging of any assets (if any) | ------ | ------ | x |\n| Approve maximum leverage ratios across the Fund and per position | ------ | ------ | x |\n| Anything else not listed below and not reasonably required to fulfill TMC duties | ------ | ------ | x |\n| Whitelist investable defi protocols | ------ | x |  |\n| Whitelist investable strategies (e.g. lending, liquidity pools, strategy vaults, arbitrage) | ------ | x |  |\n| Determine risk limits for each whitelisted strategy (e.g. limits to impermanent loss for LP, protocol risk limits for each defi product) | ------ | x |  |\n| Determine concentration limits (protocols and strategies) | ------ | x |  |\n| Allocate and rebalance fund subject to Community and TMC imposed constraints | x |  |  |\n| Actions incidental to defi yield-farming/staking (e.g. claiming rewards, swapping rewards for stablecoin, voting) | x |  |  |\n| Actions incidental or reasonably necessary to carry out whitelisted strategies and vaults | x |  |  |\n| Necessary actions to safeguard Fund assets, prevent exploits, or respond to security breaches | x |  |  |\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\nThe Independent Council Members, the Independent Signatories, and the Treasury Management Team acknowledge that, if engaged, the DAO may terminate or vary its engagement in accordance with:\n\n1. future Proposals and performance;\n2. a material breach of any term of the Treasury Management Framework which breach is not capable of being remedied or (if such a breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach within 10 days of receipt of notice from the DAO in writing to do so;\n3. any repeated breaches of the terms of the Treasury Management Framework in such a manner as to reasonably justify the opinion that its conduct is inconsistent with it having the intention or ability to give effect to the terms of this agreement;\n\nTermination of the Proposal shall not affect any of the parties’ rights and remedies that have accrued as at the date of termination. Furthermore, any termination of this agreement shall not be effective unless the agreement either expires, all things required to be done by the Proposal are completed or it is terminated by a further proposal of the DAO.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nThe Treasury Management Council wishes to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1. Ray Mogg is a Co-founder of Mycelium, an existing Tracer DAO Service Provider;\n2. William Welch is a core-contributor at Mycelium;\n3. Dion Chu is an Advisor/core-contributor to Tracer DAO, and manages private funds that does not currently, but may in the future, invest in cryptocurrency;\n4. Chris Berg is a Co-founder of RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub, an existing Tracer DAO Service Provider (Academic Advisor); and\n5. Sinclair Davidson is a Co-founder of RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub, an existing Tracer DAO Service Provider (Academic Advisor).\n\n**Note**: The remainder of this proposal did not fit within the proposal character limit on Snapshot.

      "content": "# Summary\n\nDiscourse link: [**here**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/tracer-growth-fund-remit-extension/1045)\n\nCurrently, Tracer DAO is suffering from inefficiencies that stem from pushing through operational-related proposals. Under [proposal #16](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385), Tracer DAO established the Tracer Growth Fund (***Growth Fund***) to ameliorate these inefficiencies, following successful implementations from other DAOs such as Sushi, Yearn and Reef. To remain competitive as a DAO, it is necessary to expand both the remit of the Growth Fund and provide a top-up to its stable assets.\n\nExpanding the remit of the Growth Fund, as outlined below, will expedite the payment of DAO service providers, auditors, and contractors while allowing the Growth Fund to more freely incentivise and give back to the Tracer community. Opportunities to raise the public profile of Tracer DAO arise quickly and are often time-sensitive. With the average proposal and voting period taking between 4-9 days, Tracer DAO risks missing out on these vital growth opportunities without appropriate delegation.\n\nFurthermore, as Tracer DAO interacts and collaborates with more third parties, prompt payments will be necessary to establish a reputation as a reliable and professional DAO. \n\nAs established under [proposal #16](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385), a line was drawn between:\n\n1. those decisions that fall within the remit of the Growth Fund (and ultimately with the Managers of the Growth Fund, being members of the multisig (the ***Managers***)); and\n2. those decisions that sit outside this remit and therefore, require a formal DAO Proposal and voting process.\n\nIf this proposal is successful, the Managers will have a wider remit to handle **all operating expenses** in addition to their current remit under proposal #16. Broadly, the managers will have sovereignty to direct the Growth Fund assets towards the following areas:\n\n1. contractors/contributors;\n2. additional Service Provider team payments (TCR) for greater incentive alignment;\n3. advisors to the DAO;\n4. audits;\n5. community incentives;\n6. liquidity mining rewards;\n7. DAO sponsored price feeds;\n8. insurance; and\n9. airdrops (exclusively TCR).\n\n---\n\n# Consideration\n\nThe Managers will not receive any remuneration for the provision of these services.\n\n500,000.00 DAI tokens (~12% of the total DAI holdings in the DAO treasury) will be transferred to a multisig controlled by the Managers immediately after approval to manage the cost of the Deliverables under this Proposal and [Proposal #16](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385).\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\nThe Managers shall, from the Commencement Date, and for the duration of this Proposal, oversee the provision of the Deliverables to the DAO in accordance with the terms of this Proposal.\n\nThis proposal envisages that the remit of the Managers will be expanded to include decisions involving growth opportunities and operational expenditure related to the **long-term development** of Tracer DAO. \n\nEach of the **Deliverables** is detailed below:\n\n1. expand the remit of the Growth Fund Managers to allow for:\n    1. engaging contractors and new team members of service providers, to perform certain services on behalf of the Tracer DAO (for example, developers and auditors appointed by the Managers from time to time);\n    2. payments to team members of an existing Service Providers;\n    3. payments for engaging advisors for Tracer DAO;\n    4. smart-contract audits of Tracer DAO’s financial contracts;\n    5. community incentives (such as contest rewards, DAO work remuneration, ambassador program costs, merchandise, etc.);\n    6. liquidity mining rewards (which have traditionally been funded by proposals to distribute DAO held TCR);\n    7. operational expenditure for DAO sponsored price feeds from service providers such as Chainlink;\n    8. insurance payments to mitigate against smart contract failure risk; and\n    9. airdrops to provide good incentives for positive behaviour within the DAO.\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\nThe Managers acknowledge that, if passed, the DAO may terminate or vary this proposal in accordance with:\n\n1. future Proposals and performance;\n2. the Deliverables specified above;\n3. a material breach of any term of the Agreement which breach is not capable of being remedied or (if such a breach is remediable) fails to remedy that breach within 10 days of receipt of notice from the DAO in writing to do so; and\n4. any repeated breaches of the terms of the agreement in such a manner as to reasonably justify the opinion that its conduct is inconsistent with it having the intention or ability to give effect to the terms of this agreement.\n\nTermination of the Proposal shall not affect any of the parties’ rights and remedies that have accrued as at the date of termination. Furthermore, any termination of this agreement shall not be effective unless the agreement either expires, all things required to be done by the Proposal are completed or it is terminated by a further proposal of the DAO.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Managers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nThe following conflicts of interest are declared:\n\n1. Growth Fund Managers are an [existing Service Provider](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385) to the DAO.\n\n---\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by an Authorised Representative of the DAO, all terms that are defined pursuant to the Participation Agreement will retain its meaning.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, others may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\nThe following definitions shall apply in this Proposal:\n\n## Definitions\n\n**Commencement Date:** the date this Proposal is passed on chain and is signed.\n\n**Tracer DAO:** A decentralised autonomous organisation for Tracer, an open-sourced blockchain-based financial protocol.\n\n**TCR Token:** A measure of voting power in the Tracer DAO that attaches to a specific Wallet Address, whereby the greater amount of TCR Tokens a person holds in that Wallet Address, the greater the person’s voting power.\n\n**Related party:** Means, but is not limited to, a Manager’s affiliate, assignee, transferee or one of their representatives, principals, agents, directors, officers, employees, consultants, contractors, members, shareholders, or guarantors.\n\n---\n\n# Indemnity\n\nTracer DAO shall keep the Growth Fund and each of its Members (the **Indemnified Persons**) fully indemnified against all liabilities, costs, expenses, damages and losses (including but not limited to any direct, indirect or consequential losses, loss of profit, loss of reputation, product recall costs and all interest, fines, penalties and legal costs (calculated on a full indemnity basis) and all other professional costs and expenses) suffered or incurred by any of the Indemnified Persons as a result of or in connection with: \n\n1. any claim against the Indemnified Persons for actual or alleged infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights arising out of, or in connection with, the receipt, use or performance of the Deliverables, to the extent that the claim is attributable to the acts or omissions of the Indemnified Persons, their employees, agents or subcontractors; and\n2. any claim made against the Indemnified Persons by a third party arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the Deliverables, to the extent that such claim arises out of the breach, negligent performance or failure or delay in performance of the Proposal by the Indemnified Persons, their employees, agents or subcontractors.\n\nTracer DAO will not indemnify the Indemnified Persons against liabilities, costs, expenses, damages, and losses (including direct, indirect or consequential losses) for decisions they make that are grossly negligent in the exercising of their function as decision-makers for the Growth Fund.\n\nThis clause will survive termination of the Proposal.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Results from the poll = **1st place: TOKE/USD, 2nd place: LINK/USD**.\n2. **[Twitter Poll](https://twitter.com/TracerDAO/status/1466163189549199363?s=20)**: Following the Discord poll, the top 3 most-voted selections and the least voted selection (to get an idea of how accurate the community votes are) will be used in a Twitter poll. This will be active for 24 hours.\nThis engagement with the community will have network effects as Tracer DAO affords the community and users opportunity to drive product updates and market creation. Based on the community sentiment, Governors will make a more informed decision on what is appropriate for the product. Results from the poll = **1st place: TOKE/USD, 2nd place: LINK/USD**.\n\nIf this proposal is accepted, the polling via social media will begin and results will be added to this proposal prior to the push to Snapshot. The Snapshot voting options will include all price feeds currently offered on [Arbitrum](https://docs.chain.link/docs/arbitrum-price-feeds/) that can be used in Tracer DAO's Perpetual Pools financial contract.\n\n\n\n---\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, Mycelium may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

TOKE stakers can now vote to direct liquidity into specific reactors. This phase is intended to familiarise stakers with voting, as well as balance yield APRs in advance before providing liquidity.\n\nRead more about it here: [TOKE Stakers: LD Reactor Voting Now Live (Pre-Liquidity Deployment) | by Tokemak | Tokemak | Nov, 2021 | Medium](https://medium.com/tokemak/toke-stakers-ld-reactor-voting-now-live-pre-liquidity-deployment-439c4ecb3776)\n\nTOKE stakers now must vote on specific reactors in order to earn any APR in addition to direct Tokemak liquidity for market making.\n\nAs per the previous proposal: [Proposal #26: Ignite the TCR Reactor in Tokemak](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/QmUdFBrfVNYHkrMVG9uEw3owznLp1BNnU4WYxfPD69fuF4), TOKE tokens were swapped with TCR by Tracer DAO in order for the TCR Tokemak reactor to be 'ignited'. \n\nThere is ~27k TOKE in Tracer DAO’s treasury which was recently staked and used to vote on Tokemak's C.o.R.E.2 event to vote for other reactors in addition to receiving %APR rewards for staking TOKE ([Proposal #29: Tokemak Reactor Vote Round 2](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth/proposal/0x96623a1a99b3624b9852fbc1cde7979d141fdb11735b40b27cc6f9a6f97aa307)).\n\nThis proposal, if successful will action to stake Tracer DAO's TOKE holdings into Tokemak to then direct votes toward the TCR reactor to bootstrap TCR liquidity and earn TOKE yields. Additionally, it aims to allow any TOKE token earned from staking rewards to be additionally used to vote on directing further liquidity into the TCR reactor.\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\nIf this proposal is successful, it will provide the following deliverables:\n\n1. Stake Tracer DAO's total TOKE holdings into Tokemak to then vote on directing Tokemak liquidity to the TCR reactor for bootstrapping TCR liquidity.\n2. Claim and stake further TOKE tokens received from staking rewards toward voting on directing Tokemak liquidity to the TCR reactor.\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. If this proposal is successful, it can be varied or terminated by future proposals.\n2. TOKE tokens staked in Tokemak may be returned to Tracer DAO via future proposal. In the case of a smart contract hack/emergency ‘black swan’ event, veto power is given to the Mycelium team to effectively protect Tracer DAO by returning TOKE tokens back to Tracer DAO.\n3. Additional TOKE tokens received from staking rewards may be claimed and staked to vote for liquidity directed toward the TCR reactor under the Mycelium team's discretion (depending on gas costs, opportunity cost and any other thing Mycelium deems relevant).\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1.

      "title": "Proposal #36: Accepting tTCR, Arbitrum TCR and 'unstaked' TCR for governance",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nTCR was recently approved to have its own Toke reactor on the [Tokemak protocol](https://www.tokemak.xyz/) through the first C.o.R.E. event. This enabled TCR holders to stake their TCR to provide liquidity for efficient market making for the token in return for rewards (%APR in TOKE). In other DAO protocols, local governance token holders are incentivised to stake their tokens within the local protocol to receive rewards (%APR in governance token) purely for staking to vote. This function rewards governance token holders in return for little utility to the DAO (liquidity locked + paying for people to vote). This proposal, if passed, will incentivise TCR token holders to vote in addition to providing effective utility through Tokemak for market making.\n\nReceipt token for TCR staked in Tokemak is tTCR (token address: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x15a629f0665a3eb97d7ae9a7ce7abf73aeb79415](https://etherscan.io/token/0x15a629f0665a3eb97d7ae9a7ce7abf73aeb79415)).1 tTCR token corresponds to 1 staked TCR token.\n\nCurrently Tracer DAO governance (executed through [snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth](http://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth)) is only accepting votes from staked TCR token holders, but not tTCR. This proposal is calling for accepting tTCR for casting votes with 1 tTCR token being equivalent to 1 TCR token in voting weight.\n\nIn the future this could extend to having different derivatives of TCR tokens on other platforms being used for TCR governance.\n\nAdditionally, to allow for more effective governance and to mitigate voter apathy, this proposal if passed will allow for TCR holders to propose/vote on Snapshot proposals without needing to stake their TCR tokens. This would effectively have Snapshot take a 'snapshot' of the balance of TCR tokens inside of a TCR token holder's wallet at the time that a proposal goes live - only the TCR tokens that are in the wallet at the time will be able to be used for voting. For the same purpose, this proposal will also allow for TCR token holders on Arbitrum to vote/propose on Tracer DAO governance.\n\n## **Rationale**\n\nIf passed, this change would enable TCR holders who are interested in participating in Tracer DAO governance to stake their TCR tokens to receive TOKE rewards, which will be useful in voting to direct liquidity towards TCR when Tokemak starts deploying liquidity (estimated to happen mid-late December).\n\nAt the moment of writing, there are approximately 491 holders of 59,030,731 tTCR tokens (equating to more than 40% of circulating TCR supply locked in Tokemak). These wallets are TCR holders that are essentially excluded from participating in Tracer DAO governance.\n\nEngaging tTCR, Arbitrum TCR and 'unstaked' TCR holders in Tracer DAO governance is important for Tracer DAO, since governance is the primary use case of the TCR token. \n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\nIf this proposal is successfully passed, the following deliverables will be provided:\n\n1. **tTCR** tokens will be able to be used to propose and vote on proposals in Tracer DAO's governance process on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/tracer.eth). This is in **addition** to the **staked TCR** tokens in the Tracer DAO contract (current solution).\n2. '**Unstaked TCR**' tokens will be able to be used for creating new proposals and voting on the Tracer DAO Snapshot interface.\n3. '**Arbitrum TCR**' tokens will be able to be used for creating new proposals and voting on the Tracer DAO Snapshot interface.\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. If this proposal is successful, it can be varied or terminated by future proposals.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nThe following conflicts of interest are declared:\n\n1. No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n---\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a proposal under the Participation Agreement, others may more formally document aspects of this proposal.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": "Proposal #34: Seeding TCR Rari Fuse Pool (#112)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nDiscourse link: [**here**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-seeding-tcr-rari-fuse-pool-112/971)\n\nThis proposal has been curated as per the consensus gained in the previous [EOI](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/eoi-seeding-the-rari-fuse-pool-112/965).\n\nA Rari Fuse Pool has recently been established composed of ETH, USDC, and TCR. The pool is here: [https://app.rari.capital/fuse/pool/112](https://app.rari.capital/fuse/pool/112).  If this proposal succeeds, Tracer DAO will seed this market by depositing 100,000 USDC equivalent into the pool, split evenly between the three tokens. This would facilitate the lending and borrowing of TCR.\n\n## Rationale\n\nA Rari Fuse Pool (#112) has recently been established for TCR composed of ETH, USDC, and TCR. This pool (consisting of TCR) will allow for the users to borrow against their TCR, in addition to lending TCR in a capital efficient manner. However, since the launch of the pool there has been no initial token deposits. This is understandable given the high opportunity cost of not depositing in the Tokemak Reactor or staking for Tracer governance. Given that it is likely that no TCR holder will make the first deposit into the pool, the Tracer DAO Treasury is required to get the market off the ground. The proposed 100,000 USDC equivalent worth of tokens (split evenly between ETH, USDC and TCR) will be a sufficient amount to bootstrap the market.\n\n---\n\n# Consideration\n\nIf this proposal succeeds, the following consideration will deployed:\n\n1. 100,000 USDC transferred from the Tracer DAO into the Rari Fuse Pool (#112) for TCR (combining of ETH, USDC and TCR).\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\nIf successfully voted on, this proposal will deploy:\n\n1. 33,333 USDC equivalent to TCR in the TCR fuse pool;\n2. 33,333 USDC equivalent to ETH in the TCR fuse pool; and\n3. 33,334 USDC equivalent to USDC in the TCR fuse pool.\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. If successful, this proposal may be varied or terminated by future proposals.\n2. If successful, the tokens that are sent by the Tracer DAO to the Rari fuse pool may be returned to the Tracer DAO via future proposal. If a smart contract hack/emergency or 'black swan' event occurs, veto power is given to the Mycelium team to effectively protect the Tracer DAO by removing the funds from the Rari Fuse Pool (#112) and returning them back to the DAO treasury via smart contract implementation.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nThe following conflicts of interests are declared:\n\n1. No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n---\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, others may more formally document aspects of the proposal.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": "Proposal #33 Deploy EUR/USD (1x and 3x) Perpetual Pools as FX Pilot",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nTracer Perpetual Pools may be applied to a wide range of existing financial markets to bring them on-chain. Tracer should provide a 3x and 1x leveraged EUR/USD Perp Pool on Arbitrum mainnet. This pool may be used by European cryptocurrency holders to hedge their FX risk, and will also serve as a prime example of Tracer Perp Pools being applied to an existing market, foreign exchange, that usually operates entirely independently of Crypto markets. Additionally, an FX Perp Pool would be a great place to market test higher leverage offerings (10x and above) for Perp Pools, before offering higher leverage on more volatile markets like ETH/USD and BTC/USD. If this proposal is successful, the EUR/USD price feed will be used to create DAO approved markets for 3x-L/S and 1x-L/S.\n\n## Execution\n\nChainlink offers an [EUR/USD](https://data.chain.link/arbitrum/mainnet/fiat/eur-usd) Oracle on Arbitrum, it is currently used by [Handle.Fi](https://handle.fi). This should make it possible for the pool itself to be deployed with relatively little effort. Seed liquidity should be incentivized with TCR liquidity mining rewards, in the same way liquidity is already incentivized for ETH/USD and BTC/USD pools. A specific reward schedule may be determined following a vote on whether a EUR/USD Perp Pool should be added.\n\nIf the Tracer Discourse community is open to adding a EUR/USD Perpetual Pool, we should move to a Snapshot vote.\n\n---\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, others may formally document aspects of this Proposal.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "content": "# Summary\n[Link to discourse here](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-proposal-to-protect-eth-perpetual-pools-through-risk-harbor/638).\n\nRisk Harbor is a risk management protection protocol for all cryptocurrency that provides an algorithmic, transparent, and impartial service that removes the need for trusted intermediaries. Risk Harbor has provided risk management and protection services for other major DeFi protocols including Anchor, Element Finance, and Iron Finance.\n\nRisk Harbor’s services aim to provide the following:\n\n1. Protect against smart contract risk and network vulnerabilities;\n2. Invest safely and earn risk-adjusted rewards by providing protection; and\n3. Maximise capital efficiency with market-informed dynamic pricing.\n\nRisk Harbor offers its services to Tracer DAO in order to work with the DAO on initially insuring Tracer DAO’s Perpetual Pools financial contract against smart contract risk. In addition to allowing the ability for individual users to protect themselves using our services, this proposal aims to have Tracer DAO protecting each of the currently offered markets in Perpetual Pools including:\n\n3L ETH token;\n3S ETH token;\n1L ETH token; and\n1S ETH token.\n\nThis proposal is to offer protection on the above markets in the case of smart contract failure as specified within our documentation 1. Initially, this proposal, if successful, will implement ‘protection pools’ that are funded by the DAO to emphasize Tracer DAO’s approach to security against smart contract failure. These pools will be initially allocated with 100k USDC per market as listed in the above dot points (400k USDC total). As Perpetual Pools moves toward v2 and market conditions change, further proposals may be proposed to increase these protection pools and/or add protection to the BTC/USD and other Perpetual Pool tokens.\n\n# Next Steps\nIn order for this proposal to take effect, it must be pushed to Snapshot by a DAO member and that Proposal must succeed.\n\nWe encourage the discussion of this proposal in the comments below.\n* * *\n# Consideration\nFor the provision of these services, Risk Harbor requests:\n\n400k USDC to protect against smart contract failure across the 4 different ETH/USD Pool tokens on Tracer DAO’s Perpetual Pools financial contract:\n\n1L-ETH/USDC\n\n1S-ETH/USDC\n\n3L-ETH/USDC\n\n3S-ETH/USDC\n* * *\n# Deliverables\n\nIf engaged by Proposal to provide the services described in this Proposal to the DAO, Risk Harbor will provide the following (Deliverables):\n\n1. Risk Harbor builds wrappers and contracts defining how depeg events are detected, and will launch protection pools for the select Tracer DAO perpetual pools products listed below:\n3L-ETH/USD\n3S-ETH/USD\n1L-ETH/USD\n1S-ETH/USD\n\n2. Tracer DAO to purchase protection for their users:\nAll users will then be protected (on a pro-rata basis), depending on the available protection capacity. This is a strong signal for Tracer depositors and will increase new and existing engagement for TracerDAO users as a whole as they are programmatically protected against any loss event. It is also a marketing rallying point to the ecosystem as a whole.\n\n3. Tracer DAO will underwrite Tracer DAO protection pools on Risk Harbor:\nThis shows that the Tracer DAO team is confident in their product - to the extent that they are willing to underwrite Tracer DAO protection on Risk Harbor and provide capacity for users and the community to protect themselves against any events of risk.\n400K USDC initial underwriting capacity from Tracer DAO allocated as detailed in the Considerations section. Underwriting capital will be reallocated across pools, as they expire, optimistically until Tracer DAO votes otherwise.\n\n4. Risk Harbor community admirals and team members provide support to Tracer DAO protection buyers:\nTutorials, documentation, etc. if needed\nContinuous customer support in Discord, Telegram, Twitter, etc.\n* * *\nOther sections omitted due to max word limit",

      "title": "Proposal #29: Tokemak Reactor Vote Round 2",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nThe proposal aims to stake $TOKE from the Tracer DAO treasury into a Toke reactor for the following reasons:\n1. Stake TOKE to vote on other projects in the upcoming C.o.R.E.2. event; and\n2. Stake TOKE in order for the Tracer DAO to effectively optimise its treasury for greater capital efficiency by earning yield on the TOKE tokens that are staked in [Tokemak.](https://www.tokemak.xyz/)\n\nTracer's experience with the first C.o.R.E. Rector event was a huge success and in turn developed strong relationships with the protocols that were in the spotlight. The C.o.R.E. event also effectively provided greater market exposure for Tracer DAO.\n\nAdditionally, it enabled the TCR token to have strong volumes of liquidity for users to seamlessly purchase TCR to become apart of the DAO and provide exit liquidity for liquidity miners currently using Tracer's Perpetual Pools financial contract with lower slippage. \n\n## Rationale\n\nTracer has acquired Toke in its treasury and now has the ability to utilise this TOKE to build a partnerships through the next round of Tokemaks C.o.R.E.2 Reactor voting. \n\n*\"TOKE staking voting will be 1:6, 1 TOKE = 6 votes (increase from the first C.o.R.E. for single asset staked TOKE)\"*\n\n[https://medium.com/tokemak/c-o-r-e-2-begins-tuesday-november-9th-f52ca43f0770](https://medium.com/tokemak/c-o-r-e-2-begins-tuesday-november-9th-f52ca43f0770)\n\nBecause of the multiplier of stake voting, Tracer's vote has the ability to increase the chances of the these protocol igniting a token reactor which will in turn build strong partnerships with the winning protocols and their community. \n\n---\n\n# Consideration\n\nTo expand the Tracer ecosystem, Tracer DAO will stake TOKE in its treasury to:\n\n1. Vote for 3 of the 45 candidates in the running for the C.o.R.E.2. Token reactor. \n2. Receive staking rewards up to 57% APR. Tracer DAO has 27,406.56 TOKE in its treasury available for stake voting (equating to 164,439.36 votes).\n\n![image|690x377](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/tracer/original/1X/592a44cce01f1d47b768c08d6e4d036326c2f68f.png)\n\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\nAn open Discourse poll will be open for members of the DAO to vote in the token of their choice for the 2nd C.o.R.E. event on Tokemak.\n\n1. The #1 voted candidate will receive 50% of the Tracers voting power;\n2. The #2 voted candidate will receive 30% of the Tracers voting power; and\n3. The #3 voted candidate will receive 20% of the Tracers voting power.\n\nOnce the poll has reached consensus, this proposal will be updated to include the top 3 tokens. The proposal may then be pushed to Snapshot to accept Tracer DAO staking TOKE in the Tokemak reactor to receive returns for staking and to vote on the tokens selected from the poll. \n\nThe results from the [Discourse poll](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-tokemak-reactor-vote-round-2/643/2) are as follows:\n1. TEMPLE (Temple DAO)\n2. SPELL (Abracadabra Money)\n3. MATIC (Polygon)\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. If this proposal is successful, it can be varied or terminated by future Proposals.\n2. TOKE tokens staked in Tokemak may be returned to the DAO via future proposal. In a case of a smart contract hack/emergency 'black swan' event, veto power is given to the Mycelium team to effectively protect the DAO by returning TOKE tokens back to the DAO.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nConflicts of interest to declare:\n\n1. No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n---\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, others may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

As per the forecast for the last quarter, it was expected that our costs for quarter 3 and inevitably quarter 4 would significantly increase. Our costs have increased by approximately 220% since that time (approximately U$1.1m per quarter) due to further resource allocation in the following areas:\n\n1. Senior Development hires (2);\n2. Senior Business Development hires (1);\n3. Business Development hires (2); and \n4. Ecosystem/Community hires (2).\n\nIn the coming weeks, we are looking to further expand the team (additional Senior Developers and Marketing leads) to support the following strategic goals:\n\n1. Finalising the Perpetual Pools v2 contracts (SMA pricing, permissionless deployment, solving for volatility decay) and supporting versioning updates;\n2. Greater market exposure and adoption for the Perpetual Pools contract; and\n3. Building DAO frameworks to enable decentralised contributions to Tracer DAO's contracts, community and growth.\n\nWe are currently spending approximately $400k per month. We are currently finalising Mycelium's third quarterly report to Tracer DAO and will publish it in the Discourse in the next week.\n\n## Updates\n\nIn accordance with the Proposal engaging Mycelium, and to assist Mycelium to execute upon these strategic goals, Mycelium requests:\n\n1. The current remuneration of U$250,000.00 (or equivalent) per month (or part thereof) is increased to U$500,000.00 (or equivalent) per month (or part thereof) starting on the day that a Proposal implementing this Proposal is executed and ending when Mycelium is no longer engaged by the DAO, to be paid on the last day of each calendar month. If a payment does not occur because the DAO has insufficient funds, the amount of that payment will accrue and be paid to Mycelium when the DAO has sufficient funds to pay for that calendar month.\n\nIt is expected that all other aspects of Mycelium’s engagement, detailed in the Proposal passed on 12 February 2021, will remain the same.\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables and Commitments\n\nIf this proposal succeeds, Mycelium’s Deliverables and Commitments, as outlined in the Proposal passed on 10 February 2021 as well as the update proposal passed on 14 July, will remain the same.\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. Mycelium acknowledges that, if engaged, its engagement can be varied by future Proposals.\n2. Mycelium expects that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the deliverables specified above.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer Project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nMycelium wishes to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1. It is an existing Service Provider to Tracer DAO.\n\n---\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, Mycelium may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n---\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nDiscourse link: [**here**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/advisors-and-growth-consultants-ryan-sean-adams-and-david-hoffman/445)\n\nRyan Sean Adams (RSA) and David Hoffman (David) are jointly proposing a growth consulting and strategic advisory service for Tracer DAO.\n\nBoth of us have played an instrumental role in building thriving DeFi communities and propagating core narratives in the space. As advisors, we would apply our community building, media strategy, and narrative building skills to propel the growth of Tracer DAO.\n\nAdditionally, we believe Tracer DAO will need connections, allies, and partnerships, both in the DeFi ecosystem and in the traditional world. Our work as Media producers of the Bankless podcast (1 million downloads per month) and the Bankless newsletter (80,000 subscribers) has given us an extensive network of relationships across exchanges, funds, media, and influential individuals. As advisors, we can lend this network to help with introductions and advice.\n\nWe believe strongly in a bankless future.\n\nWe also believe DeFi needs a strong and capital efficient derivatives market such as those found on centralized exchanges. To date, centralized parties haved dwarfed DeFi perpetuals products by all measures. We believe Tracer DAO has an opportunity to change that by building a decentralized perpetuals primitive that surpasses centralized alternatives and brings us closer to a more bankless future.\n\n## Growth Fund Allocation\nIf successful, this proposal will draw TCR from the [Growth Fund](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385). As the Growth Fund is currently not implemented, this proposal will draw TCR from the DAO treasury. The amount of TCR will be deducted from the Growth Fund allocation.\n\n---\n\n# Remuneration\n\nFor the provision of our diversification efforts and services, we request:\n\n1. 3,500,000 TCR vested on a pro rata basis over 91 weeks, starting on the day that this proposal is executed; and\n\n2. 50% of the above TCR remuneration will be provided to RSA and 50% will be provided to David.\n\nRemuneration to be provided to addresses:\n**RSA Address (RSA.eth)**: 0xe9d18dbfd105155eb367fcfef87eaaafd15ea4b2\n**David Address**: 0x9f8D8096489d7d0e1A1051ABa87D34024447b7e3\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\nIf we are engaged to provide the services described in this Proposal, we will provide the following:\n\n* 1 hour per week of consultation to the Mycelium team in connection with its development of Tracer;\n* Private advisor channel with response to requests for assistance in 48 hours; and\n* Regular presence in the Tracer DAO community\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. We, RSA and David, acknowledge that, if engaged, our engagement can be varied or terminated by future Proposals. However, this termination is limited to 2,000,000 TCR which relates to my advisory efforts; and\n2. We expect that any engagement will be terminated if we fail to deliver in accordance with the Deliverables specified above.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nWe, RSA and David, wish to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1. Angel investment in Lyra Finance - RSA.\n\n---\n\n# Clarification\n\nAny advisory service provided by RSA or David will not provide Tracer DAO any unearned access to Bankless related podcasts or newsletters. Bankless editorial decisions are merit-based only.\n\n---\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, we, RSA and David, may introduce more formally documented aspects of the Proposal.\n\n---\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n- RSA and David\n\nAuthors:\n\n[Ryan Sean Adams] is a crypto investor, advisor, & co-founder of Bankless.

      "content": "# Summary\n\nDiscourse link: [**here**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/ignite-tcr-reactor-in-tokemak/593)\n\nTokemak offers its services to Tracer DAO (DAO) in order to work with the DAO on establishing a TCR reactor. A TCR reactor on Tokemak will strengthen liquidity for TCR trading pairs across trading venues and open up additional opportunities to leverage Tokemak.\n\nTo initialize a TCR reactor, Tokemak requires an operational reserve of TCR to be able to efficiently deploy TCR liquidity to trading venues (Uniswap, SushiSwap, 0x, Balancer) and make TCR LPs on Tokemak benefit from IL mitigation. This can be structured as set out in the Proposal below.\n\nThrough this Proposal, Tracer DAO will make $1.5M USDC in TCR available to the Tokemak reactor reserve by proceeding with the Collateral Trade, defined below. \n\n## Growth Fund Allocation\nIf successful, this proposal will draw TCR from the [Growth Fund](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385). As the Growth Fund is currently not implemented, this proposal will draw TCR from the DAO treasury. The amount of TCR will be deducted from the Growth Fund allocation.\n\n---\n\n# Consideration\n\nFor the provision of these services, the parties agree that within one day of this Proposal being approved that:\n\n1. $1,500,000.00 notional value (USDC) of TCR will be sent by Tracer DAO to the Tokemak treasury; and\n2. $1,500,000.00 notional value (USDC) of TOKE will be sent by Tokemak to the Tracer DAO treasury.\n    \n    (collectively, **Collateral Trade**)\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\nIf engaged by a Proposal to provide the services described in this Proposal to the DAO, Tokemak will provide the following deliverables (***Deliverables***):\n\n- Ensure that generalized liquidity is directed across the ecosystem, ensuring the best prices and minimal slippage for TCR trading.\n- The services will create an opportunity for both TCR liquidity providers and Tracer DAO to earn additional rewards.\n- Tokemak will initiate a reactor that will result in additional ways for Tracer DAO to leverage Tokemak, such as offering single-asset TCR staking to provide liquidity across major L1 DEXs. The services provided by Tokemak will offer the (optional) opportunity for tTCR staking in Tracer, with the following benefits:\n    - single-asset stakers now become liquidity providers. This will increase TCR liquidity across DeFi;\n    - a simplified process to provide liquidity. This lowers UX barriers and along with lower risk will increase the engagement of less-knowledgeable participants;\n    - TCR, as the tTCR holder, would be the recipient of a sizable amount of TOKE rewards, which could be either used to further increase liquidity director power.\n\n---\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. Tokemak acknowledges that, if engaged, its engagement can be varied or terminated by future Proposals.\n2. Tokemak expects that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the Deliverables specified above.\n\n---\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1.

      "content": "\n# Summary\n\nDiscourse link: [**here**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/code-423n4-arena-audit-bug-bounty-2/555)\n\n\nThis proposal is for the purpose of engaging Code Arena (Code 423n4) to audit the **Tracer Perpetual Pools contracts** as a bug bounty. Code 423n4 offer a “community-driven approach to competitive smart contract audits”. They have also previously provided a bug bounty audit for **Tracer’s Perpetual Swaps contracts** as per the  [**EOI, operations post**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/code-423n4-audit-operations/278) and the reimbursement [**proposal**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-12-update-to-myceliums-offer/316). In addition to Sigma Prime’s audit, this initiative accords with Tracer’s vision for deploying impenetrable smart contracts.\n\nThe audit is running for a total period of one week starting from 6/10/21 - 2:39pm UTC time. Prior to the audit, everyone wishing to participate in the audit should join the **C4 Discord channel** to register their address as per the documentation here: [**Become a Code 423n4 Warden**](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/wardens). View the countdown for the Tracer contest to begin here: [**Code 423n4**](https://code423n4.com/). There will be a total of **$30,000 USDC** & **$20,000** (USDC equivalent) TCR offered in the prize pool for bugs found in the Tracer Perpetual Pools contracts as per the criteria here: [**Judging Criteria 1.**](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/wardens/judging-criteria).\n\nPlease share with anyone who would be interested in auditing the Tracer contracts in return for USDC.\n\nMycelium has already paid the required $30,000 USDC for the bug bounty. If successful this proposal will action to have Mycelium reimbursed by Tracer DAO.\n\n\n# Growth Fund Allocation\n\n\nIncluded in this proposal is a **$20,000.00** (USDC equivalent) **TCR** payment for winners of the bug bounty. As per the [**Tracer Growth Fund proposal**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-16-tracer-growth-fund/385), the bug bounty TCR payment sits within the remit of initiative 1 within Deliverables as a Service Provider:\n\n  1. 80,000,000 TCR (8%) new Service Providers and contractors and employees of existing Service Providers.\n\nMycelium has already paid the required $20,000.00 (USDC equivalent) TCR payment for the bug bounty. Once the Growth Fund is live, the decision to reimburse Mycelium sits within the remit of the Growth Fund Managers. Thus, if this current proposal is successful, it will only trigger the reimbursement of $30,000.00 USDC to Mycelium.\n\n\n# Remuneration\n\nFor the provision of these services, the following remuneration package is proposed:\n\n  1. $30,000 USDC (or equivalent) to reimburse Mycelium for the bounty award pool.\n\n\n# Deliverables\n\n\nIf engaged by this DAO proposal to provide the services described in this Offer to the DAO, Code 423n4 will commit to provide the following deliverables:\n\n  1. An Audit of the core Tracer Protocol perpetual pools codebase at [**https://github.com/tracer-protocol/perpetual-pools-contracts**]( https://github.com/tracer-protocol/perpetual-pools-contracts)\n\nThis audit will be community driven and aim to locate bugs, exploits and security concerns throughout the protocol code.\n\n\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n  1. Code 423n4 acknowledges that, if engaged, its engagement can be varied by future proposals.\n  2. Code 423n4 expects that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the deliverables specified above.\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n  1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n  2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nCode 423n4 wishes to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n  1. No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n\n # Interpretation\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a proposal under the Participation Agreement, Code 423n4 may more formally document aspects of that proposal.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [**CC0**](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n",

Runtime Verification provide a smart contract analysis and verification service with experience in formal modelling, analysis, safety, security, validation and verification. They have worked with \"*NASA, DARPA, Boeing, and Toyota, on formalizing and verifying safety and mission critical systems, and with IOHK and the Ethereum Foundation to formally model and verify not only smart contracts, but also consensus protocols, programming languages and virtual machines.*\n\nThis audit will be a 7 week process, during which Runtime Verification will detail any errors found with the **Tracer Perpetual Pools** and **vesting contracts** codebase. The Mycelium team will work with Runtime Verification throughout the audit to fix any bugs and help them to navigate and understand the codebase. This initiative aligns with the Tracer Whitepaper ([**Tracer: Peer-to-Peer Finance**](https://tracer.finance/media/white-papers/peer-to-peer/peer-to-peer-finance.pdf)), where it was set out that Tracer DAO would adhere to strict security standards in relation to its smart contracts.\n\nIf engaged by Tracer DAO, Runtime Verification will commence work on 25 October 2021.

      "title": "Proposal #21: TCR-ETH Uniswap v3 Liquidity Pool Proposal - Visor Finance",
      "content": "\n# Summary\n\nDiscourse link: [**here**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-tcr-eth-uniswap-v3-liquidity-pool-proposal-visor-finance/522)\n\nThis is a proposal for the Tracer DAO treasury to provide liquidity to the TCR-ETH pair on Uniswap v3 for both Ethereum Mainnet and Arbitrum. According to the proposal, Tracer DAO will supply the liquidity for both pools using its treasury funds and have Visor Finance manage the pools. Visor Finance are an active manager focused on liquidity provisioning strategies on Uniswap v3. Visor Finance currently manage over 20 pairs on Uniswap v3, and provide an infrastructure for protocols to use their own treasury funds to provide liquidity and generate yield. the Visor Finance treasury management service caters to the individual needs of the protocols serviced by Visor Finance. For Tracer DAO, the focus will be on providing deeper liquidity for the TCR-ETH pair to support larger volume trades without suffering significant slippage.\n\n# Rationale\nThe current slippage on Sushiswap both on Mainnet and on Arbitrum is very high due to the lack of liquidity. A trade of around ~$3,000 USD will suffer around 2% slippage on Mainnet and even more on Arbitrum. As such, it is of utmost importance to deepen the liquidity for the TCR-ETH trading pair.\n\nThe capital efficiency of Uniswap v3 offers many advantages. Given that much of the liquidity will be concentrated around the current price tick, there will be less slippage for same volume trades on the same amount of liquidity as on Sushiswap (or Uniswap v2). For example, concentrating liquidity around +/-50% of the current price will have 4x the capital efficiency of Sushiswap and may require less than 25% of the liquidity as Sushiswap. See calculation here: [** TCR Capital Efficiency Calculations - Google Sheets 4**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-tcr-eth-uniswap-v3-liquidity-pool-proposal-visor-finance/522). Additionally, the lower liquidity threshold required on Uniswap v3 allows for Tracer to provide the liquidity with its own treasury, diminishing the need to pay liquidity mining rewards for TCR-ETH.\n\nManaging the price range on Uniswap v3 requires active management, which is provided by Visor Finance and its research organization Gamma Strategies. As the price of TCR varies, Visor Finance will ensure that the price stays within range, and that there is sufficient liquidity to support TCR-ETH trade volume.\n\nAt present, there is an urgent need for trading liquidity on the secondary markets. The capital efficiency of Uniswap v3 makes it possible for Tracer to provide that liquidity with its own treasury funds. Doing so saves costs by eliminating the need for liquidity mining rewards for TCR, in addition to generating additional yield for the treasury.\n\n# Consideration\nTo provide further liquidity of the TCR token, Tracer DAO will supply the following for Visor Finance to manage:\n\n1. $500,000 USD equivalent of TCR; and\n2. $500,000 USD equivalent of ETH.\n\n70% of the supplied liquidity will be directed to Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum and the remaning 30% will be directed to Uniswap v3 on Ethereum Mainnet. The 0.3% fee tier shall be used for both pools.\n\nFor the provision of these services, Visor Finance requests:\n\n1. A management fee of 10% of the earned Uniswap fees. 90% of the earned fees are re-invested back into LP positions to increase the balance of liquidity over time.\n# Deliverables\nIf engaged by Proposal to provide the services described in this Proposal to the DAO, Visor Finance will provide the following (***Deliverables***):\n\n1. Ensure that the provided liquidity is effectively managed in the Uniswap v3 Arbitrum and Ethereum Mainnet TCR-ETH pools.\n\n# Variation and Termination\n1. Visor Finance acknowledges that, if engaged, its engagement can be varied or terminated by future Proposals.\n2. Visor Finance expects that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the deliverables specified above.\n3. If this proposal is successful, the liquidity provided by this proposal may be withdrawn via a future proposal.\n# Conflicts of Interest\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nVisor Finance wishes to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1. No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n # Interpretation\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, Visor Finance may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to CC0.",

      "title": "Proposal #20: Tracer Perpetual Pools and Liquidity Mining",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nTracer Perpetual Pools have almost arrived.\n\nOver the past month, in preparation for the finalisation of Perpetual Pools, Tracer DAO members (including Service Providers, [**Strategic Partners**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-11-strategic-treasury-diversification/286/14) and [**Academic Advisors**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-5-rmit-bih-research-collaboration-governance/127/3)) have been working together to form a tentative tokenomics model as displayed in the graphs [here](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/public-distribution-event-faqs/453). It is important to note that future retroactive airdrops will be considered throughout this period.\n\nIf this proposal succeeds, Tracer DAO will:\n\n1. Install Tracer Perpetual Pools in the Tracer Factory; and\n2. Enable 100,000,000 TCR (10% of total supply) to be distributed for liquidity mining of the Perpetual Pools contracts, in accordance with the [**projected market distribution**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/current-and-future-token-distribution/224) for Tracer DAO.\n\nThe Mycelium team will have initial oversight  of the Perpetual Pools financial contract to implement upgrades and provide stability on an as per needed basis.\n\n### Perpetual Pools\n\nPerpetual Pools is a new financial primitive that enables anybody to take a short or long position on any underlying asset. These positions are non-liquidatable, fully collateralised, fully-fungible and can exist perpetually without upkeep. By taking a position, users mint fungible ERC20 tokens representing ownership of the pool of assets. These fungible positions allow users to interact with the DeFi economy seamlessly and sustain their leveraged exposure.\n\nRead the Tracer: Perpetual Pools Litepaper **[here](https://tracer.finance/media/white-papers/perp-pools/perpetual-pools.pdf)**.\n\n### Market Distribution\n\n![image|690x497](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/tracer/original/1X/68246dbb2116d8902fe175f25dc0354e971335e1.png)\n\nAlongside other described [**benefits**](https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-liquidity-mining), liquidity mining serves two purposes:\n\n1. To incentivise liquidity providers for the Perpetual Pools financial contract with TCR. This will allow users to govern the way that they trade using the Tracer protocol; and \n2. Further decentralise Tracer DAO via the TCR governance token.\n\n### Liquidity Mining Schedule\n\nA brief version of the liquidity mining schedule can be found below. If this proposal passes, a more detailed version of the schedule will be published. The graph below depicts an example schedule projection for the initial 6 months after the launch of Tracer DAO's Perpetual Pools contract.\n\n![image|600x371](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/tracer/original/1X/4fd4fe3c45a8c7cf0f8360707f2c62976f1f8418.png)\n\nFrom the day of launch, liquidity providers will receive TCR, where 57% (out of the allocated 5% over the first 6 months) will be distributed in the first 4 weeks of launch. The alignment between TCR token holders and Tracer DAO stakeholder primacy is crucial for successful decentralised governance and it will ultimately deliver a stronger Tracer DAO.\n\nThe total 100,000,000 TCR (10% of total TCR supply) will be distributed over a period of 5 years with 2.85% to be distributed within the first 4 weeks of the liquidity mining scheme. The markets that are proposed to be available at launch to participate in the liquidity mining scheme are:\n\n- BTC/USDC (1x leverage)\n- BTC/USDC (3x leverage)\n- ETH/USDC (1x leverage)\n- ETH/USDC (3x leverage)\n\nLiquidity mining will also be available for markets deployed in the future.\n\nThere are two proposed methods of liquidity mining:\n\n1. **Primary Market Liquidity** (purchasing a pool token); and\n2. **Secondary Market Liquidity** (placing a pool token into an AMM liquidity pool).\n\nFrom genesis, 40% of the TCR distribution (of the total 100,000,000 TCR) will be allocated to Primary Market Liquidity and 60% will be allocated to the Secondary Market Liquidity. Liquidity mining will begin after the [**Gnosis Auction event**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-17-sushi-miso-auction-public-distribution-event/433/3) has concluded on 15 September.\n\n# Consideration\n\nFor liquidity mining to begin alongside the release of Tracer Perpetual Pools, the following amount will be distributed amongst users of the Perpetual Pools financial contract over the specified 5 year schedule:\n\n1. 100,000,000 TCR (10% of TCR network equity).\n\n# Deliverables\n\nIf this proposal passes, the Tracer Perpetual Pools contract will be installed in the Tracer Factory and Tracer DAO's liquidity mining event will begin at the same time. This will distribute the TCR token amongst early users of the Tracer protocol to help with the governance of the DAO.\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\nThe liquidity mining schedule may be updated or terminated depending on future market conditions. A future proposal may be passed by the DAO to action an update/termination if the liquidity mining event no longer serves its purpose as detailed in this proposal.\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, others may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [**CC0**](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": "Proposal #17: Sushi MISO Auction - Public distribution event",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal has been formalised based on the previous [**EOI**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/sushi-miso-auction-proposal/432) and [**proposal**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-sushi-miso-auction-public-distribution-event/433) on Tracer DAO's Discourse.\n\nFollowing extensive discussion by Tracer DAO members and the Tracer community [**on Discourse**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/using-gnosis-auction-for-token-distribution-event/242) - this Proposal relates to Tracer DAO engaging [**Sushi**](https://sushi.com/) to conduct a public token distribution event via [**batch auction**](https://instantmiso.gitbook.io/miso/markets/markets) to be conducted on [**Sushi's**](https://sushi.com) [**Minimal Initial Sushiswap Offering**](https://instantmiso.gitbook.io/miso/) (MISO) platform.\n\nSushi's MISO platform is [**described**](https://instantmiso.gitbook.io/miso/) as follows: MISO aims to drive new capital and trade to the exchange by increasing the attractiveness of SushiSwap as a place for token creators and communities to launch new project tokens. \n\nIf this proposal succeeds, Sushi will provide a batch auction for the public token distribution event. Sushi describes batch auctions in its [**documents**](https://instantmiso.gitbook.io/miso/markets/markets) as:\n\n*A Market method whereby a set amount of tokens are divided amongst all the contributors to the Market event, weighted according to their contribution to the pool. Whatever your percentage of the total raise, that's the portion of the total tokens on offer you will receive. Straightforward. Batch Auctions will be useful for projects looking to ensure that everyone taking part is rewarded, no matter their net worth.*\n\nThe reason for proposing the use of Sushi MISO's batch auction over other alternatives, such as [**Gnosis Auction**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/using-gnosis-auction-for-token-distribution-event/242), is that it provides wider visibility for the public token distribution event because it is hosted by Sushi (a large player in DeFi) and also provides the option of simple migration of liquidity to [**Sushiswap Exchange**](https://app.sushi.com/swap) post launch.\n\n# Consideration\n\nUse of the MISO platform is of no cost to Tracer DAO. The passing of this proposal will allow 50,000,000 TCR tokens (5% TCR network equity) to be transferred to the MISO whitelisted address to be provided for the public token distribution event.\n\n# Parameters\n\nThe parameters for this proposal arise from a community poll on the [**Discourse**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/using-gnosis-auction-for-token-distribution-event/242/3) in addition to further advice from strategic partners and academic advisors to Tracer DAO. Additionally the minimum valuation capitalisation is proposed based on a combination of the mentioned polls, previous [**valuations**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-11-strategic-treasury-diversification/286/14) and advice to Tracer DAO from advisors Chris Berg and Peyman Khezr of RMIT made on [**Discourse**](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/using-gnosis-auction-for-token-distribution-event/242/26) referencing their research [**paper**](http://chrisberg.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Khezr-and-Berg-TracerDAO-Gnosis-auction-reserve-price.pdf): *Setting the reserve price for the Tracer DAO Gnosis auction*.\n\nThe proposed parameters for the auction are as follows:\n\n1. Total distribution: 50,000,000 TCR (5% TCR network equity)\n2. Bidding token: [DAI](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f)\n3. Auction token: [TCR](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9c4a4204b79dd291d6b6571c5be8bbcd0622f050)\n4. Minimum price per token: $0.05 DAI = implied minimum raise of $2,500,000 DAI (min. fully diluted valuation = $50,000,000 DAI)\n5. Auction start date: September 10th\n6. Auction period: 5 days \n7. Auction type: Batch Auction\n\n# Deliverables\n\nIf engaged by Tracer DAO, Sushi will provide a TCR (Tracer governance token) public distribution event for the Tracer protocol via batch auction on the Sushi MISO platform for a total distribution of 50,000,000 TCR (5% network equity).\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nMISO Auction (Sushi) holds the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1. No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

Chris Berg (Co-founder) of RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub | 0x219BaD06180F4024A06C372d754E882D175Df098 |\n\nCollectively, these parties will be referred to as the **Growth Fund Managers** or **Managers**.\n\n# Remuneration\nThe Managers will not receive any remuneration for the provision of these services.\n\nThe following tokens will be transferred to a multi-sig controlled by the Managers:\n1. 280,000,000 TCR Tokens (28% of TCR total supply) vested across the proposed distribution:\na. 80,000,000 TCR Tokens (8% of TCR total supply) vested linearly across year 1 (year 1 commencing as soon as Growth Fund is implemented); and\nb. 200,000,000 TCR Tokens (20% of TCR total supply) vested linearly across years 2-10.\n\n![Growth Fund Schedule](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/tracer/optimized/1X/29b5c442bfd5bc08fa5eae829bae1bcdb53d27de_2_690x427.png)\n\n# Deliverables\nIf this proposal succeeds, the Growth Fund Managers will commit to provide the following deliverables:\n1. A monthly update, via Discourse, including all activities conducted by the Managers; and\n2. Ensuring that the fund is effectively spent.\n\nAt this time, it is expected that the Growth Fund will be used to further the following initiatives:\n1. 80,000,000 TCR (8%) new Service Providers and contractors and employees of existing Service Providers;\n2. 80,000,000 TCR (8%) operational expenditure;\n3. 60,000,000 TCR (6%) cash reserves;\n4. 30,000,000 TCR (3%) advisors; and\n5. 30,000,000 TCR (3%) short-term development.\n\nThis proposal envisages that the remit of the Managers will be decisions involving growth opportunities and operational expenditure related to the the **short-term and long-term development** of Tracer DAO and Tracer. Each of the above initiatives are detailed below:\n1. Engaging contractors and new team members of Service Providers, to perform certain services on behalf of the Tracer DAO. For example, developers and auditors;\n2. Engaging professional services to support the operational and strategic decision-making of the DAO. For examples, lawyers, accountants marketing professionals etc;\n3. Cash reserves to cater for situations where the Growth Fund needs to exchange TCR for non-TCR tokens (particularly USD) to support the aforementioned activities of the Managers. For example, unforeseen expenses and DAO M&As;\n4. Engaging advisors to support operational and strategic decision making of the DAO;\n5. Engaging short-term contributors via proposal or grant (can be retroactively reimbursed) and funding events and programs.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\nInnovative solution ideas were raised within the ‘Tracer Drop’ call with RMIT [Tracer Drop Episode #04: Development Funds](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/tracer-drop-episode-04-development-funds/336). These ideas will be further explored using the Growth Fund and implemented where deemed suitable. Ideas included:\n\n- Granting funds (TCR tokens) to ‘philanthropists’ to execute solutions for certain problems;\n     - This effectively combines a typical ‘Grant’ model with the long-term incentive structure of venture finance; and\n     - These ‘philanthropists’ in time will receive reputation for their work and will become trusted to deliver future work.\n\n# Commitments\nIf the Managers is engaged to provide the Deliverables, it will:\n1. Not use tokens held in the Growth Fund to vote on Tracer DAO Proposals.\n\n# Variation and Termination\n1. The Managers acknowledge that, if engaged, its engagement can be varied by future Proposals. For the avoidance of doubt, the engagement of certain members of the Managers can also be varied by future Proposals.\n2. The Managers expects that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the deliverables specified above. If the engagement of the Managers is terminated, all remaining tokens in the Growth Fund will be returned to Tracer DAO’s treasury.\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\nIn the context of the Tracer Project, conflicts of interest include:\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nThe Managers wish to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n1. Raymond is a Co-founder of Mycelium, an existing Tracer DAO member (Service Provider);\n2. Ash is also a Co-founder of Mycelium;\n3. Pat is also a Co-founder of Mycelium;\n4. Michael and Vance are Founders of Framework Ventures, an existing Tracer DAO member (Strategic Partner);\n5. Richard (CEO) and Aaron (Research Associate) of DACM, an existing Tracer DAO member (Strategic Partner);\n6. Balder (Managing Partner) and Mathijs (Investment Manager) of Maven11, an existing Tracer DAO member (Strategic Partner); and\n7. Chris (Co-founder) of RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub, an existing Tracer DAO member (Academic Advisor).\n\n# Interpretation\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, the Managers may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\nCopyright and related rights are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": "Proposal #15: Maple Pools - Treasury Diversification",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal relates to Tracer DAO depositing $1.25 million USDC from its treasury into one of [Maple Finance](https://www.maple.finance)'s lending pools, for a 180 day period, to earn interest and Maple tokens (MPL).\n\nFollowing Tracer DAO's recent treasury diversification, the DAO received a mixture of $4.5 million USDC and DAI (see Treasury Contract [here](https://www.notion.so/280d488eb3369cb713ec53ce386b6cba)) - the intended primary use of these funds is to compensate current and future Service Providers (as per the proposal [Strategic Treasury Diversification](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-strategic-treasury-diversification/286)). In the meantime, the DAO can allocate a portion of its treasury to earn yield while they remain unused, as sought by Governor m4ri0ml [here](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/optimizing-tracerdaos-treasury-reserves/245).\n\nMaple is an undercollateralized lending protocol for institutional borrowers and provides fixed-income opportunities for lenders.\n\nMaple offers borrowers transparent and efficient financing, entirely on-chain. For lenders, Maple offers a yield through lending to a variety of premium institutions in the blockchain industry including [Framework Labs](https://framework.ventures/), [Wintermute](https://www.wintermute.com/) and [Amber Group](https://www.ambergroup.io/). The Pool Delegates that manage these pools perform diligence and set terms with Borrowers.\n\nThe Maple protocol is governed by the MPL token, which enables token holders to participate in governance, share in fee revenues, and stake insurance to Lending Pools.\n\nFor more information on Maple, check out its documentation [here](https://maplefinance.gitbook.io/maple/).\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis proposal relates to Tracer DAO depositing **$1.25 million USDC** into one of Maple Finance's lending pools, on the following terms:\n\n- The amount would be locked for 180 days;\n- The amount would be applied to fund corporate loans to market makers and market neutral funds;\n- Approximate yield is projected to be approximately 47% APY at total of $70 million USDC capacity and MPL price of $12.2. APY will change as the pool grows so that if the pool reaches $140 million USDC the approximate yield would reduce to approximately 30% APY;\n- Interest, paid in USDC, can be claimed monthly and would be between 9-11% APY. It is proposed that this amount is claimed by Tracer DAO each month and reinvested into the lending pool; and\n- MPL rewards are claimable block by block with no vesting. It is proposed that these tokens are claimed by Tracer DAO each month. Subject to any subsequent proposal of the DAO, it is proposed that the earned MPL tokens be retained in the Tracer DAO Treasury - allowing the DAO to earn [establishment fee distributions](https://maplefinance.gitbook.io/maple/protocol/maple-token-holders/what-fees-are-shared-with-mpl-holders) from the Maple Protocol.\n\nThe deposited amount will remain in the pool for the required period of 180 days and will then be returned to the DAO, unless a modifying proposal is executed.\n\n## Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\n\n## Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "content": "**Summary**\nI, Yamashita, am proposing a strategic treasury diversification for Tracer DAO as well as offering my advisory and financial engineering services to Mycelium and Tracer DAO.\n\nIn the past, I have played an instrumental role in delivering secure Perpetual Swap agreements to the market that have supported trillions of dollars of transaction volume. I am bullish on seeing the traditional financial system replaced with more secure and reliable transactional methods that minimise counter-party risk and maximise transparency and value provided for users of the system. From what I’ve seen, Tracer DAO fits this bill and I’m happy to provide my time and money to work with the DAO to seek this end.\n\nI believe that I can provide great value in guiding the Tracer DAO to change the future of finance. I intend to guide Tracer DAO to build derivative contracts that will enable new digital and real word markets to be unlocked that provide meaningful ways for people to manage and take risk.\n\nFor now, you must respect my decision to preserve my identity and privacy, the Mycelium team will be able to confirm my value as a strategic advisor to Tracer DAO.\n\n**Remuneration**\nFor the provision of my diversification efforts and services, I request:\n\n- 10,000,000 TCR vested on a pro rata basis over 91 weeks, starting on the day that this proposal is executed.\n\n**Deliverables**\nIf I am engaged to provide the services described in this Proposal to the DAO, I will provide the following:\n\n- 1 hour per week of consultation to the Mycelium team.\n- $250,000 USD (half in wBTC and half in ETH), delivered upon execution of this proposal.\n\nI also commit to not be involved in any product that is a competitor to any of the Tracer Factory’s products.\n\n**Variation and Termination**\n- I, Yamashita, acknowledge that, if engaged, my engagement can be varied or terminated by future Proposals. However, this termination is limited to 5,000,000 TCR which relates to my advisory efforts.\n- I expect that any engagement will be terminated if I fail to deliver in accordance with the Deliverables specified above.\n\n**Conflicts of Interest**\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n- Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n- Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nI, Yamashita, wish to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n- No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n**Interpretation**\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, I, Yamashita, may introduce more formally documented aspects of the Proposal.\n\n**Copyright Waiver**\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [CC0 1](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": "Proposal #13: Bankless Media Partnership",
      "content": "**Summary**\nBankless LLC is proposing a limited media partnership with Tracer DAO, using its marketing verticals to help promote Tracer’s upcoming DeFi products.\n\nBankless prides itself on serving as a media staple in the world of decentralized finance, prioritizing the values that brought us to crypto in the first place: self-sovereignty, fairness, and openness. Bankless started in 2019 as a newsletter, and added a podcast in 2020. In 2021, we have earned our place as a self-sustaining media company dedicated to democratizing access to information across the DeFi landscape.\n\nAs a commitment to these values, we planted our flag with Bankless DAO, the first media and culture-centric DAO, on a mission to propagate crypto media, culture, and values to 1 billion people.\n\nA key component of the Bankless mission is our marketing partnerships, in which we develop mutually-beneficial relationships with projects we believe in. The unique advantage of partnering with Bankless is the opportunity to work with an informed team that cares about DeFi values, as well as access to a powerful network of loyal followers who trust our partners.\n\nWe have found particular success in our ‘Blitz’ campaigns, which involve focused, 2-week sessions of intense media coverage across our Twitter, Youtube, Podcast, and Newsletter platforms. These Blitzes work especially well when announcing new projects, events, or exciting community developments. Flexibility in our content, communication with our partners and partnering communities, and crafting organic & engaging narratives are all important to us.\n\nThe scope of the partnership is set out below, detailing two such Blitzes to take place August 16-31 and September 16-30 of 2021.\n\nWe are excited to team up with Tracer DAO and spread the word of its innovative and capital efficient approach to derivative contracts. We are interested in following Tracer DAO’s progress and want to be a part of its launch into the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n**Remuneration**\nFor the provision of these services, Bankless requests:\n\n*30,000 USDC* to be paid immediately upon approval of the Proposal.\nDeliverables\nIf engaged by Proposal to provide the services described in this Proposal to the DAO, Bankless will provide the following (Deliverables):\n\n• A Two-Week Marketing Blitz Campaign on Bankless’s Media Platforms (August 16-31) consisting of:\n- 4x 10 Second Mentions on Podcasts (and show notes)\n- 4x 10 Second Mentions on Videos (and show notes)\n- 8x Tweets across our primary Twitter accounts\n- 5x Newsletter Mentions\n\n• A Two-Week Marketing Blitz Campaign on Bankless’s Media Platforms (September 16-30) consisting of:\n- 4x 10 Second Mentions on Podcasts (and show notes)\n- 4x 10 Second Mentions on Videos (and show notes)\n- 8x Tweets across our primary Twitter accounts\n- 5x Newsletter Mentions\n\n**Variation and Termination**\nBankless acknowledges that, if engaged, its engagement can be varied or terminated by future Proposals.\nBankless expects that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the deliverables specified above.\n\n**Conflicts of Interest**\nIn the context of the Tracer project, conflicts of interest include:\n- Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n- Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nBankless wishes to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n- No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n**Interpretation**\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, Bankless may introduce more formally documented aspects of the Proposal.\n\n**Copyright Waiver**\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to [***CC0***](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "content": "The following [proposal](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/proposal-update-to-myceliums-offer/316) has been created as per the initial support for the [EOI](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/update-to-myceliums-offer/314) expressing an update to Mycelium’s offer to Tracer DAO.\n\nIf DAO members are in favour of the proposal, it may be pushed through to Snapshot to commence the voting process. If any member is not in favour of the proposal or wishes to provide feedback/suggestions, feel free to leave a comment in the reply threads.\n\n# Summary\n\nOn 27 January 2021, Mycelium ([formerly Lion’s Mane ](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/lions-mane-rebranding/296)) posted [an offer on GitHub ](https://github.com/lions-mane/tracer-dao/blob/lionsmane-proposal/proposals/LionsmaneProposal.md)to perform certain services for Tracer DAO. On 10 February 2021, that offer was accepted, via Proposal and vote, by Tracer DAO.\n\nSince that time, the Tracer DAO has grown significantly, including the following key developments:\n\n1. Completed first audit of Perpetual Swaps codebase with Sigma Prime;\n2. Commenced a research collaboration with RMIT BIH (including bi-weekly community calls - Tracer Drop);\n3. Engaged 52 committed and experienced Governors from the community;\n4. Onboarded 102 Alpha Testers to test the Perpetual Swaps contracts;\n5. Engaged Flex Dapps to build Tracer’s Keeper Liquidations Bot and governance frontend;\n6. Engaged 8 Funds, 2 Market Makers, 2 DAOs and 20 Angels as Strategic Partners to support Tracer’s ongoing development;\n7. Completed Alpha Testing for Perpetual Swaps on Kovan Testnet; and\n8. Almost completed second audit of Perpetual Swaps codebase with Code 423n4.\n\nAs reported in [Mycelium’s first Quarterly Report](https://github.com/lions-mane/Quarterly-Reports-to-Tracer-DAO/blob/master/Report-1-10-February-2021-to-10-May-2021.pdf), Mycelium incurred U$420,994.97 in connection with its delivery of services from 10 February 2021 to 10 May 2021. Our costs have increased by approximately 15% since that time (so, approximately U$485,000 per quarter) and, in the coming weeks, we are looking to further expand the team (particularly Senior Developers and Product Heads) to support the following strategic goals:\n\n1. Finalising the Perpetual Swaps contracts, and supporting versioning updates;\n2. Fast-tracking the development of Tracer’s dnAMM contracts; and\n3. Fast-tracking the development of Tracer’s Pool Swaps contracts.\n\n# Updates\n\nIn accordance with the Proposal engaging Mycelium, and to assist Mycelium to execute upon these strategic goals, Mycelium requests:\n\n1. Back payment of approximately U$375,000 (or equivalent), being equivalent to U$75,000 (or equivalent) per month (or part thereof) earned from 10 February 2021 to the day that a Proposal implementing this EOI is executed, pursuant to [the Proposal appointing Mycelium](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6f070a1785917b6d0b84d2a6ad5caa1f827d144b0bbbb0c41005708d36f46b18), to be paid on the day that a Proposal implementing this EOI is executed;\n2. A reimbursement of U$96,000 (or equivalent) for the Code 423n4 Audit, [as discussed here](https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/code-423n4-audit-operations/278), to be paid on the day that a Proposal implementing this EOI is executed; and\n3. The current remuneration of U$75,000 (or equivalent) per month (or part thereof) is increased to U$250,000 (or equivalent) per month (or part thereof) starting on the day that a Proposal implementing this EOI is executed and ending when Mycelium is no longer engaged by the DAO, to be paid on the last day of each calendar month. If a payment does not occur because the DAO has insufficient funds, the amount of that payment will accrue and be paid to Mycelium when the DAO has sufficient funds to pay for that calendar month.\n\nIt is expected that all other aspects of Mycelium’s engagement, detailed in the Proposal passed on 12 February 2021, will remain the same.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nIn order for this EOI to take effect, a Proposal must be commenced by a current DAO member and that Proposal must succeed.\n\nWe encourage the discussion of this EOI in the comments below.\n\n# Deliverables and Commitments\n\nIf this EOI succeeds, Mycelium’s Deliverables and Commitments, as outlined in the [Proposal](https://github.com/lions-mane/tracer-dao/blob/lionsmane-proposal/proposals/LionsmaneProposal.md) passed on 10 February 2021, will remain the same.\n\n# Variation and Termination\n\n1. Mycelium acknowledges that, if engaged, its engagement can be varied by future Proposals.\n2. Mycelium expects that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the deliverables specified above.\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer Project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1. Existing Service Providers who are Related Parties; and\n2. Existing (vested and unvested) holdings of TCR tokens.\n\nMycelium wishes to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n1. It is an existing Service Provider to Tracer DAO.\n\n# Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this offer, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, Mycelium may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights are waived pursuant to [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).\n\n",

      "content": "# Summary\nThis proposal would diversify a portion of the TCR governance tokens held in the Tracer DAO treasury into USDC via a direct TCR acquisition by Maven 11 and its strategic partners, listed in the section below.\n\nThis proposal attempts to strike a balance between:\n\n1. Not expending too many TCR tokens at an early stage for the protocol; and\n\n2. Introducing a variety of long-term strategic partners to the Tracer DAO with a variety of specialisations, to support the DAO in areas including:\n\n   a. capital for further proposals;\n\n    b. advice based on industry experience;\n\n   c. liquidity to ensure stability of protocol;\n\n   d. networking to increase flow of opportunities for Tracer DAO; and e. diversifying the Tracer DAO to help guard against the event of any (macro) market downturn.\n\nWe note that these considerations are inspired by comments made by various members of the Tracer community in recent months, including **RMIT BIH (SincDavidson), Wulfmane, Beepidibop, JustASushiChef, MordantBlack, yodges, Mark11** and **Lion’s Mane**.\n\nWe remind all community members that the TCR token is a governance token only, which means it allows holders to participate in Tracer DAO via its governance mechanism and provides no ownership, financial or economic rights of any kind.\n\n# Strategic Partners\n\n|Strategic Partner|$USDC Commitment|Number of TCR Tokens|Ethereum Address|\n| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n|**Funds**|\n|Framework Ventures|$1,000,000|22,222,222|0x0d298f3220eAdf02D10C9Feff537B50787725418|\n|DACM|$750,000|16,666,667|0xf8ccf1f5381956f4152B5570627C49D42eABB60e|\n|Maven 11|$300,000|6,666,667|0x8938892193FddAB15F113459E91e1c4Ab1f052A4|\n|Apollo Capital|$300,000|6,666,667|0x2ce5f9f52C1eec9a1183f91139C59b485Ff39dAd|\n|Distributed Global Ventures T2 LP|$225,000|5,000,000|0xb298F84eB4A1b5180a90006c8573422CD66321fc|\n|Distributed Global Ventures II LP|$225,000|5,000,000|0xC572550343B4bC82734Cfb6bA28c86b350513F18|\n|Paperclip Fund|$150,000|3,333,333|0x09a73Ca620c4D2e92009a68cB681741745191774|\n|Supernova|$80,000|1,777,778|0xc1bbc31e3b4300f3dc0f865ee10c38fc0e0b8061|\n|**Market Makers**|\n|GSR|$500,000|11,111,111|0x2f529d5E02A531141516F2B62C1EF48AF8048913|\n|Efficient Frontier|$100,000|2,222,222|0xcb4f5a5f5ebec3de8f697cf38b7fa0f1878110f4|\n|**DAOs**|\n|The LAO|$200,000|4,444,444|0x2D81713c58452c92C19b2917e1C770eEcF53Fe41|\n|Baires DAO|$100,000|2,222,222|0xf6b6f07862a02c85628b3a9688beae07fea9c863|\n|**Angels**|\n|Maker Mafia (Nik, Charles, Gustav & Mariano)|$75,000|1,666,667|0xc304e5d59707DA4F821e136B965DDeF534FB47B1|\n|Simon Cant (Reinventure)|$58,350|1,296,667|0x51164aBE5Fcd2249CEB75aC54afE0AFD8d36ad4e|\n|Danny Gilligan (Reinventure)|$58,350|1,296,667|0x2Cf0DfCc4149f8CaA8F5D6614CCB339587f8F20f|\n|Joyce Yang (GCR)|$50,000|1,111,111|0xb0353d0A6690B0De6C50F00A1dd4D3B227fF596b|\n|Stani Kulechov (Aave)|$50,000|1,111,111|0xF5Fb27b912D987B5b6e02A1B1BE0C1F0740E2c6f|\n|Ashwin Ramachandran (Dragonfly)|$50,000|1,111,111|0xd046135Ba00B0315eD4c3135206C87a7F4EB57D9|\n|Philippe Perzi (Exec Dir.

Token Strategic Diversification\n\n   1. Tracer DAO will transfer 100,000,000 TCR tokens (10% of TCR token total supply) to the strategic partners.\n\n    2. In consideration, the strategic partners will collectively transfer 4,500,000 USDC to Tracer DAO.\n\n2. Method of Transfer\n\n   1. Once this proposal is executed on Snapshot, each strategic partner will have 14 days to transfer its agreed amount of USDC to the DAO Treasury (Transfer Period).\n\n    2. If a strategic partner does not deposit its agreed amount of USDC to Tracer DAO’s treasury within the Transfer Period, any deposited USDC will be returned to that strategic partner, and it will not receive any TCR tokens in connection with this proposal.\n\n    3. At the end of the Transfer Period, an on-chain proposal will be pushed to the DAO to transfer the strategic partners' TCR tokens to a vesting contract.\n\n    4. Once the on-chain proposal is executed, TCR tokens will begin vesting to the strategic partners.\n\n3. Vesting\n\n   1. The tokens will vest linearly over a two year period, starting when this proposal is executed on-chain.\n\n4. Variation and Termination\n\n    1. This proposal cannot be varied or terminated by future proposals.\n\n# Conflicts of Interest\n\nIn the context of the Tracer Project, conflicts of interest include:\n\n1.

The proposal must be then passed and pushed onchain to engage the Alpha Testers.\n\nAs mentioned, this proposal is a recommendation which is open to suggestions for any changes that members see fit. Members are able convey such suggestions in the comments thread below. If a change is deemed worthy by the DAO, the proposal can be updated before it is pushed for voting.\n\n# Summary\nTracer DAO (DAO) is considering accepting 100 applicants from the 1650 alpha testing applications it received while applications were open (the Alpha Testers). Lion’s Mane has curated a list of applicants to present to DAO members for discussion and selection. The process for curating the list can be found here: Alpha Testing Applications Selection Process.\n\nBefore the Ethereum mainnet launch of Tracer’s Perpetual Swaps, these Alpha Testers will be required to test the protocol’s code to ensure that it is functional, secure and rid of any bugs. Alpha Testers will also serve the purpose of reviewing the protocol’s UI/UX to suggest any improvements or fixes before the product is ready for mainnet. The recommended Alpha Testers were filtered based on the best of the following characteristics:\n\n- Traders;\n- Market Makers;\n- Insurers;\n- Liquidations; and\n- Oracle Experts.\n\nIt is important to remember that this process is designed to cultivate the best possible group of Alpha Testers to ensure the protocol is as good as it can be.\n\nThe following Proposal, if accepted, will accept 100 applicants into the DAO, as Alpha Testers. The full list can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1v2qdYu1ptOuIzmEjb5h2tgApEbppNgvGFVMbAfzGX1Y/edit#gid=1533278785)\n\n# Consideration\nIf this Proposal is accepted, each Alpha Tester will receive the following:\n\n- 1 TCR governance token vested on the day that the Alpha Tester is engaged; and\n- 24,999 TCR vesting in equal monthly instalments over a two year period, starting on the day that the Alpha Tester is engaged, except during the first two months following engagement. On the first day following those first two months, 1/12 of the tokens will vest.\n\n# Deliverables\nIf this Proposal is accepted, Alpha Testers will provide the following (collectively the Deliverables ):\n\n- Active engagement in Alpha Testing of Tracer’s Perpetual Swaps contract; and\n- Active engagement in Tracer’s communications channels (Discourse, Discord, Twitter).\n\n# Variation and Termination\n- Alpha Testers acknowledge that, if engaged, their engagement can be varied by future Proposals.\n- Alpha Testers expect that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the Deliverables specified above.\n\n# Interpretation\nUnless otherwise defined in this Proposal, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires. The singular includes the plural, and the converse also applies.\n\nIf this Proposal is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, members may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\nCopyright and related rights to this Proposal are waived pursuant to CC0.",

      "title": "Proposal #6: New Governers (Batch 1)",
      "content": "## [](\\\"#summary\\\")Summary\n\nTracer DAO is inviting new governors to join the DAO to govern the Tracer Protocol. Over the coming weeks, 200 new governors will be accepted into the DAO. Candidates are considered for selection from the following categories as per the [Radar Article: Govern Tracer](\\\"https://tracer.finance/radar/govern-tracer\\\"):\n\n*   Oracle Experts\n*   Protocol Governors\n*   Smart Contract Engineers\n*   Ecosystem Advocates\n*   Market Pioneers\n*   Market Makers\n*   Active DeFi Users\n*   Crypto Economists\n*   Eth2 Node Operators & Researchers\n*   Integrations Team\n*   Designers\n*   Layer 2 Experts\n\nAs a part of Lion’s Mane’s engagement to Tracer DAO, a recommended list of applicants was curated and presented to current DAO members for discussion and approval. The process used to create the recommended list can be found here [Governor Applications: Lion’s Mane Recommendation](\\\"https://discourse.tracer.finance/t/governor-applications-lions-mane-recommendation/142\\\").\n\nLion’s Mane has recommended that governors are accepted by Tracer DAO in batches of ~50\\. The reasons supporting this revised approach:\n\n1.  In the short term, accepting ~50 new DAO governors allows more voices to be heard on each proposal; and\n2.  By accepting members in batches, Tracer DAO is likely to attract more potential governors via the networks of already accepted governors.\n\nIt is important to remember that this process is designed to cultivate the best possible group of decentralised Tracer DAO governors, who will lead Tracer to change the financial industry as we know it.\n\nIn line with this revised approach, Lion’s Mane will:\n\n1.  Reopen applications for Tracer DAO governors; and\n2.  Apply a similar methodology to collating the Tracer Alpha Tester applications, which are still being received.\n\nThe following proposal, if engaged, will accept the first batch of new governors into Tracer DAO.\n\n## [](\\\"#remuneration\\\")Remuneration\n\n1.  1 TCR vested on the day that member is engaged (if engaged); and\n2.  49,999 TCR vesting in equal monthly instalments over a two year period, starting on the day that the new governors are engaged, except during the first two months following engagement. On the first day following those first two months, 1/12 of the tokens will vest. Subsequently, vested tokens may be claimed at any time.\n\n## [](\\\"#deliverables\\\")Deliverables\n\nIf this DAO Proposal is accepted, new governors will commit to ( _**Deliverables**_ ):\n\n1.  Voting on each Tracer DAO Proposal; and\n2.  Active engagement in Tracer’s communications channels (Discourse, Discord, Twitter). This includes contributing to discussion relating to upcoming proposals (justified for/against).\n\nThe proposed first batch of 52 new governors can be found here:  \n[Tracer >|< Governor Applications - Final LM Recommendation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eL5YgAS2JoGymy0YrZluxbyF1OXPBPcn-PKbLIStEsg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## [](\\\"#variation-and-termination\\\")Variation and Termination\n\n1.  New governors acknowledge that, if engaged, their engagement can be varied by future Proposals.\n2.  New governors expect that any engagement will be terminated if they fail to deliver in accordance with the Deliverables specified above.\n\n## [](\\\"#interpretation\\\")Interpretation\n\nUnless otherwise defined in this Proposal, all terms beginning with a capital letter which are defined in the Participation Agreement have the same meaning unless the context otherwise requires.\n\nIf this Proposal is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, members may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n## [](\\\"#copyright-waiver\\\")Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights are waived pursuant to [CC0](\\\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\\\").\n\n## [](\\\"#technical-implementation-of-proposal\\\")Technical Implementation of Proposal\n\nIn order for the 52 governors to be engaged to provide the services described above, the following targets and relevant Proposal data must be passed to the DAO, via Proposal, by a current DAO member, in order to facilitate the execution of that Proposal. For each piece of Proposal data provided, the function encoded data that must be passed into the DAO is present, as well as the parameters and function calls used to generate this data.

Transfer 52 * 49999 TCR tokens to the vesting contract. Tokens to be linearly vested over 2 years with a 2 month cliff;\n2.  Allow new governors (52) to claim 1 TCR token;\n\n## [](\\\"#summary-of-proposal-data\\\")Summary of Proposal Data\n\n**targets** : [“0x9C4A4204B79dd291D6b6571C5BE8BbcD0622F050”, “0x9C4A4204B79dd291D6b6571C5BE8BbcD0622F050”]\n\n**proposalData** : [“0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000399257702f0f05ebec30c17b8888be1b2a321e3600000000000000000000000000000000000000000002268f76a7c51f08b00000”, “0xa9059cbb00000000000000000000000045eca81a5bfbdd58cafb225bd4c9c49c8db99754000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002d1a51c7e00500000“]\n\n## [](\\\"#step-1\\\")Step 1\n\nname: **Transfer 52 * 49999=2599948 TCR tokens to the new vesting contract**\n\ntarget: **0x9C4A4204B79dd291D6b6571C5BE8BbcD0622F050**\n\nproposalData:\n\n**0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000399257702f0f05ebec30c17b8888be1b2a321e3600000000000000000000000000000000000000000002268f76a7c51f08b00000**\n\nraw data:\n\n*   **Function: transfer**\n*   **Parameters:**\n    *   **Type: address**\n    *   **Name: to**\n    *   **Value: 0x399257702f0f05ebec30c17b8888be1b2a321e36**\n*   *   **Type: uint256**\n    *   **Name: amount**\n    *   **Value: 2599948000000000000000000**\n\n## [](\\\"#step-2\\\")Step 2\n\nname: **Transfer 52 TCR to the airdropper contract**\n\ntarget: **0x9C4A4204B79dd291D6b6571C5BE8BbcD0622F050**\n\nproposalData:\n\n**0xa9059cbb00000000000000000000000045eca81a5bfbdd58cafb225bd4c9c49c8db99754000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002d1a51c7e00500000**\n\nraw data:\n\n*   **Function: transfer**\n*   **Parameters:**\n    *   **Type: address**\n    *   **Name: to**\n    *   **Value: 0x45eca81a5bfbDd58cafB225bD4C9c49c8DB99754**\n*   *   **Type: uint256**\n    *   **Name: amount**\n    *   **Value: 52000000000000000000**",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nRMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub (a research centre within RMIT University) (**RMIT BIH**) proposes a research collaboration (section 1) with the Tracer DAO for the development of governance and cryptoeconomic design relating to Tracer and the Tracer DAO (collectively, the _**Tracer Project**_) **.**\n\nIn parallel (section 2) some members of the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub will participate in Tracer and the Tracer DAO and will be allocated governance tokens in order to do so. These members do not represent RMIT University or the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub, and governance decisions made as members of the Tracer DAO should not be understood to be the decisions of RMIT University.\n\nIn order to ensure that these members are able to participate in Tracer governance as the network grows and governance tokens are released to the community, the Tracer DAO will provide 17,500,000 Tracer governance tokens (TCR) over 2 years. 2% will be released upfront, and the remaining 98% will be released linearly over 2 years. This may be stopped temporarily or permanently depending on member participation.\n\n# 1\\. RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub research collaboration\n\n## 1.1 Deliverables\n\nIf this DAO Proposal is accepted, RMIT BIH commits to (_**Deliverables**_):\n\n1.  Participating in four conferences (two per year during the Term) discussing Tracer related content;\n2.  Publishing 24 Medium articles relating to Tracer (10 during the first 6 months of the Term, 8 during the second 6 months of the Term, 4 during the third 6 months of the Term and 2 during the final 6 months of the Term);\n3.  Publishing four academic papers, within a relevant research journal, in accordance with the “Academic research topics” section below;\n4.  Speaking at events relating to Tracer, within a conference-like setting (at least 1 per year during the Term);\n5.  Hosting or co-hosting DeFi conferences and events (at least one per year during the Term);\n6.  Sponsoring teams relevant to the Tracer DAO (including Service Providers) in events, including hackathons and workshops (at least once during the Term); and\n7.  Promoting job opportunities relevant to the Tracer DAO through relevant RMIT BIH portals.\n8.  At the end of each quarter, make public and update, via RMIT BIH’s website or social media accounts, a roadmap which details work which will be done for the next quarter in relation to this Offer.\n\n## 1.2 Academic research topics\n\nThe four research papers that will be published either as working papers or in peer reviewed journals by RMIT BIH during the Term are:\n\n1.  A publication pertaining to Tracer’s technical governance specifications, the theoretical grounds for their selection, and implementation;\n2.  A publication pertaining to an analysis of oracle economics, and what the market can take from oracles’ role within the Tracer ecosystem;\n3.  A reflective publication documenting any insights, findings, or key takeaways relating to DeFi governance or economics regarding Tracer. The aim of this is to contribute to the development of the literature about DeFi governance; and\n4.  Another topic to be decided by RMIT BIH in its reasonable discretion and in collaboration with other members of the Tracer community.\n\n## 1.3 Medium/Blog Article Topics\n\n24 Medium/blog articles that will be published by RMIT BIH pertaining to the Tracer project and its ecosystem.\n\n## 1.4 Variation and Termination\n\n1.  RMIT BIH acknowledges that its engagement can be varied by future Proposals.\n2.  RMIT BIH expects that any engagement will be terminated if it fails to deliver in accordance with the Deliverables or Commitments specified above.\n\n## 1.5 Conflicts of Interest\n\nRMIT BIH wishes to declare the following conflicts of interest:\n\n*   No conflicts of interest to declare.\n\n## 1.6 Interpretation\n\nIf this Offer is accepted as a Proposal under the Participation Agreement, RMIT BIH may more formally document aspects of that Proposal.\n\n## 2\\. Participation in governance\n\nRMIT University cannot be a member of a DAO. However, some members of the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub are able to do so in their private capacity.\n\nIndividual members will participate in Tracer governance. This participation will draw on the public research of RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub into Tracer, decentralised finance, and blockchain governance.\n\nParticipation will include but not be limited to:\n\n1.  Voting on each Tracer DAO Proposal;\n2.  Regularly commencing Proposals (at least one Proposal every six months); and\n3.  Actively engage on Tracer’s communications channels, including at least one monthly post.\n\nThese members will exercise their own judgment independent of RMIT University in making governance decisions, and will not be acting as agents of RMIT University while doing so.\n\n# Technical Implementation of Proposal\n\nIn order for RMIT to be engaged to provide the services described in the Offer, the following targets and relevant proposalData must be passed to the DAO, via proposal, by a current DAO member, in order to facilitate the execution of that proposal. For each piece of proposal data provided, the function encoded data that must be passed into the DAO is present, as well as the parameters and function calls used to generate this data. By utilising a package such as web3, any DAO member may verify this data using the web3.eth.abi.decodeParameters function ([web3.eth.abi — web3.js 1.0.0 documentation](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-abi.html#decodeparameters)).\n\nThe steps that the DAO must execute in order to appoint RMIT are as follows:\n\n1.  Transfer 350000 TCR tokens to the RMIT multisig\n2.  Transfer 17150000 TCR tokens to the vesting contract\n3.  Set up a vesting schedule for 17150000 TCR to be linearly vested to the RMIT multisig over 2 years, claimable at any time during that period\n\n## Step 1\n\nname: **Transfer 350000 TCR tokens to the RMIT multisig**\n\ntarget: **0x9C4A4204B79dd291D6b6571C5BE8BbcD0622F050**\n\nproposalData:\n\n**0xa9059cbb00000000000000000000000071c56d72f1a37eb19e596d7262bb8e07d157a708000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004a1d89bb94865ec00000**\n\nraw data:\n\n*   **Function: transfer**\n*   **Parameters:**\n    *   **Type: address**\n    *   **Name: to**\n    *   **Value: 0x71C56D72f1A37eB19E596d7262BB8e07D157A708**\n*   *   **Type: uint256**\n    *   **Name: amount**\n    *   **Value: 350000000000000000000000**\n\n## Step 2\n\nname: **Transfer 17150000 TCR to the vesting contract**\n\ntarget: **0x9C4A4204B79dd291D6b6571C5BE8BbcD0622F050**\n\nproposalData:\n\n**0xa9059cbb00000000000000000000000090d93f5a390bfdbc401f92e916197ee17470a4470000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e2fa75ce76db822c00000**\n\nraw data:\n\n*   **Function: transfer**\n*   **Parameters:**\n    *   **Type: address**\n    *   **Name: to**\n    *   **Value: 0x90d93f5a390bfdbc401f92e916197ee17470a447**\n*   *   **Type: uint256**\n    *   **Name: amount**\n    *   **Value: 17150000000000000000000000**\n\n## Step 3\n\nname: **Set vesting for 17150000 TCR to be linearly vested over 2 years**\n\ntarget: **0x90d93f5a390bfdbc401f92e916197ee17470a447**\n\nproposalData: **0x7825e7b500000000000000000000000071c56d72f1a37eb19e596d7262bb8e07d157a7080000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e2fa75ce76db822c00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000068**\n\nraw data:\n\n*   **Function: setVestingSchedule**\n*   **Parameters:**\n    *   **Type: address**\n    *   **Name: account**\n    *   **Value:** **0x71C56D72f1A37eB19E596d7262BB8e07D157A708**\n*   *   **Type: uint256**\n    *   **Name: amount**\n    *   **Value: 17150000000000000000000000**\n*   *   **Type: bool**\n    *   **Name: isFixed**\n    *   **Value: false**\n*   *   **Type: uint256**\n    *   **Name: cliffWeeks**\n    *   **Value: 0**\n*   *   **Type: uint256**\n    *   **Name: vestingWeeks**\n    *   **Value: 104**",
