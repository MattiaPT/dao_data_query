      "title": "TIP-083: Contractor Role for Threshold Intern",
      "content": "## Purpose\n\nThis proposal aims to engage @badc_23 as the Intern for Threshold Network. Given the expanding scope of Threshold’s projects, additional support is crucial for maintaining Threshold’s efficiency and achieving the DAO’s objectives. @Badc_23 offers services at a reduced rate of $55 per hour for a minimum of a guaranteed 15hrs per week, with scope for further hours adhoc, when the guilds require it.\n\nA core colleague, likely @eh_ethan, will liaise to guide and prioritize tasks with further help from IG, MG and TG members to request help from intern when need. A monthly review within IG call would help align and prioritize tasks also. This all should help guilds request for additional and keep track of workload, which provides overall clarity to the process and progress.\n## Motivation\n\nThe intern position is designed to provide additional bandwidth to key DAO members, ensuring timely completion of tasks and enhancing overall productivity. There are a significant number of tasks in which the DAO needs support with, but these task do not warrant costing the DAO $85 or $100 an hour, for this reason, some of these tasks fall between the cracks.\n\nJustification:\n\n* Enhanced Support: Key players within the DAO will benefit from additional support, allowing them to focus on strategic initiatives while operational and research tasks are contributed to effectively by the intern.\n* Improved Efficiency: The addition of an intern is intended to streamline processes, ensuring milestones are met and deliverables are completed on schedule.\n* Cost-Effective Solution: At a rate of $55 per hour, this proposal offers the DAO an opportunity to expand its workforce without the financial commitment of the standard rate.\n* Contributor Development: Engaging an intern will provide the DAO with an opportunity to train a dedicated contributor, fostering their growth and enhancing their capabilities for future key roles within the organization.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe responsibilities will be broken down into two main fronts: Marketing Support and Integration Support.\n\n**Marketing Support:**\n\n* Content Creation & Social Media Engagement:\n* Coordinating with past and upcoming integrations to create DeFi threads, showing users how to use tBTC in various yield opportunities and boost Threshold’s X reach through collaboration with other DAOs.\n* Creating weekly updates on the best places to get yield on tBTC & thUSD.\n* Coordinating with The Engine media to create more podcasts.\n* Assisting the MG on creating tBTC and thUSD campaigns.\n* Work with protocols to arrange co-marketing (DeFi threads, AMAs/ Spaces, Blog posts and guests in Threshold community calls).\n\n* Research into tBTC competitors (mBTC, zBTC, SolvBTC).\n* Newsletter drafts\n* Drafting governance comms & updates and adding to content calendar\n* Market & competitor research, as needed\n* Telegram, Reddit, and other engagement opportunities — Inserting Threshold and our suite of services into relevant conversations\n* Weekly DAO recap\n* Tracking External/PR appearances & content:\n  * Blogs\n  * Podcasts/ AMA\n  * Other (external) Threshold related content\n* Educational guides and yield opportunities content creation.\n* Supporting in Twitter drafted content\n\n**Integration Support:**\n\n* Integration Research: Supporting the Threshold Growth Coordinator by conducting groundwork on which chain to take tBTC to next, this includes collection of key metrics from chains, creating an ecosystem map for Grants, Oracles, DEX’s, Lending Protocols, dPerps etc.\n* tBTC and thUSD yield management: Create an Index of where tBTC and thUSD is active and users can get yield on.\n* Listings Management: Updating tBTC and thUSD listings across various platforms.\n* Miscellaneous Tasks: Addressing various tasks as needed to support the DAO’s operations that key members do not have the bandwidth to handle and which should not incur high hourly billing rates.\n* Co-Marketing coordination\n  * Working with protocols to post DeFi yield strats on X for each new protocol integration\n  * Setting up AMAs/ Spaces and the Engine podcasts\n  * Blog detailing new tBTC integrations\n  * Guests on Threshold Community calls\n  \n**Other DAO Things:** \n* ChainPatrol monitoring\n* Ongoing spot checks that systems and sites are working as intended (connecting wallet, making sure no errors in tools, docs, etc. — recommending enhancements, reporting bugs and errors)\n* Ongoing spot checks that third party information is correct (ie Trust wallet no tbtc v2 logo, updating all boardroom mentions to Tally, on relevant cmc, defillama, etc. dashboards, and Web3 directories and insight tools)\n* Verify that each Council multisig has the intended signers.\n## Oversight & Review\n\n## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\nThe intern’s performance will be assessed through a quarterly self-reported summary of achievements compared to stated aims in this proposal. Key performance indicators include:\n\n* Strategic Contributions: Effective input and support in research, project management, and strategic initiatives.\n* Quality Relationship Building: Establishing and nurturing valuable relationships with key partners and stakeholders.\n* Proactive Engagement: Active participation in significant integration projects of Threshold products across various platforms.\n* Quantitative Achievements: Contributing to the minting of significant amounts of tBTC and thUSD because of the additional bandwidth provided to the DAO.\n\n## Transfer of Responsibility\n\nShould this proposal be passed, a 4 week transition period will be observed period to allow for a smoother transition for Diddy and the guilds. Once the 4-weeks has passed, Diddy would commence the role.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nWe recommend that Threshold DAO contract with DiddyK for a 6-month renewable period working a guaranteed 15 hours/week (with potential for hours more when required) at a rate of $55 USD per hour.\n\n## Why Diddy\n\nDiddy has proven to be a useful asset within the Threshold community, particularly through his work with thUSD. His contributions are marked by a good attention to detail and here’s why Diddy stands out:\n\n1. Professional Expertise: As an engineer working on one of the largest infrastructure projects in the UK, Diddy brings a wealth of experience in project management, strategic planning, and problem-solving. These skills are directly transferable to the needs of the Threshold DAO, ensuring a structured and efficient approach to tackling challenges.\n2. Proven Dedication: Diddy has demonstrated a strong commitment to the Threshold community through his voluntary research work. His detailed analyses have and will continue to contribute to the development and strategic direction of thUSD.\n3. Multifaceted Skill Set: Diddy excels in both technical and strategic domains. His ability to conduct thorough research, coupled with his professional skills in managing complex projects, positions him uniquely to handle diverse tasks within the DAO, from integrations support to marketing initiatives. This kind of support is ideal for an intern role where tasks are likely to be varied.\n4. Fresh Perspective: Being relatively new to the Threshold community, Diddy brings a fresh perspective that can drive innovation and new ideas. His rapid learning curve and increasing confidence in contributions demonstrate his potential to bring significant value to the DAO.\n5. Recently became a member of the thUSD Steering Committee and such ties will provide great continuity and insight.\n\n## References\n\nLUSD research project: [https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/1209235156552908862/1209587061716295720](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/1209235156552908862/1209587061716295720__;!!OepYZ6Q!-izQhniB6hxexhgEFh-x1dPpke8Qp7JIJ8j05cL-a7VrHOJdfnjrih3x8Pu1WUB7_VcriFu__sHaN1tnQ2kUgjnwXu61l74$)\n\nCrvUSD research project: [https://discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/1209235156552908862/1212795150527504484](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/discord.com/channels/866378471868727316/1209235156552908862/1212795150527504484__;!!OepYZ6Q!-izQhniB6hxexhgEFh-x1dPpke8Qp7JIJ8j05cL-a7VrHOJdfnjrih3x8Pu1WUB7_VcriFu__sHaN1tnQ2kUgjnwjzl5rZs$)",

      "content": "**Vote Type**\n\nToken holder DAO Snapshot was approved (717M voting, 100% approved); this is  Governor Bravo transfer\n\n**DAO-elected Sponsors**\n\n@ramaruro1, @MrsNuBooty, @sap\n\n**Timeline**\n\n- 3 days for comment / discussion on this proposal\n\n- Token-holder DAO Snapshot temp check with a 3-day vote period\n- If Snapshot is approved, then the standard 11-day Governor Bravo vote\n\n**Context**\n\nSeveral exciting trends have been accelerating DeFi since Threshold launched version 2 of tBTC in early 2023: the continued substantial growth in the number of crypto users globally, institutional involvement in multiple areas of crypto, the explosive growth to $170B of stablecoins, a growing number of protocols supporting almost every conceivable financial application (many of which Threshold partners with), and of course the unprecedented amount of assets and activity occurring on Layer 2s (including the emerging Bitcoin L2 space).\n\n**Accelerating tBTC growth on Layer 2 chains**\n\nAfter executing our successful campaign on Arbitrum based on a grant we received from the Arbitrum Foundation, and by which we deployed rewards to liquidity providers, developed a Direct Minting app, integrated tBTC into GMX and about to launch a loyalty program - it’s time to fund an aggressive TVL expansion of tBTC on other L2s.\n\nBase is especially interesting. The Coinbase team is launching their own cbBTC, which we expect will drive a lot of volume and inflow from this major centralized exchange. What at first sounds like competition, it is actually a great opportunity for us since they’ve expressed interest in involving tBTC in the upcoming launch, including a tBTC integration on the Coinbase Wallet and collaborating on liquidity, incentives and marketing activity for the cbBTC/tBTC pair.\n\nWe also consider it essential to capitalize on opportunities to expand the use of tBTC in these times of market uncertainty. A lot of recognized protocols, market players and incipient projects are reaching out to us with partnership opportunities and tremendous growth potential. We need to have the flexibility and muscle to be able to act quickly.\n\nThe Treasury Guild Committee requests 90M T to identify and execute direct and indirect marketing activities designed to quickly grow tBTC deposits, including but not limited to expanding liquidity provisioning on Base.\n\nThe objective is to help DeFi users, communities, and interested institutions frictionlessly adopt tBTC, including by migrating from other Bitcoin wrappers.\n\nActivities will be coordinated between the Treasury Guild and Threshold’s Marketing leads, and the necessary transactions will be executed by the Treasury Guild.\n\n**Treasury Guild Committee Discretion**\n\nIn normal times a proposal like this would include more detail on specific tactics, expected outcomes and measures of success. But these aren’t normal times – we have a unique opportunity to capture substantial market share in a short time by capitalizing on the market trends described above.\n\nGiven the authority token holders have entrusted to the Treasury Guild Committee (and supporting contractors) to not only manage our treasury but also Threshold’s protocol owned liquidity, the expansion of the beta staker program, short-term control over tBTC mint & redeem fees, etc., the proposal recommends once again delegating to the committee for this growth effort. The committee will provide periodic updates on its progress, an accounting of funds deployed and return any unspent tokens.\n\n**Forum discussion:**\n\nhttps://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-087-90m-t-to-accelerate-tbtc-growth-including-on-base/959/1",

      "title": "TIP79 - Use thUSD protocol for expenses ",
      "content": "Tldr\nUse thUSD protocol to mint thUSD against tBTC collateral to pay for some of the DAO’s monthly expenses.\n\nProposal\nConvert $400k T into tBTC each month and add that tBTC as collateral to a vault on the thUSD protocol to mint $160k thUSD (with a safe 250% collateralization ratio). Use the minted thUSD to pay part of the DAO’s monthly expenses.\n\nBenefits\nToday the DAO pays expenses, including collaborator compensations, with T from the treasury. This is a pretty straightforward operation and each collaborator gets exposure to T. It also implies that the treasury gets depleted by ~$300k each month.\n\nIf instead, the DAO buys tBTC each month and borrows against it to pay expenses, the benefits would be:\n\n- T gets dollar-cost averaged (DCA) into BTC: DCA is an investment strategy where an investor divides the total amount to be invested across periodic purchases of a target asset. This strategy aims to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase, removes the pressure to make perfect timing decisions, as investments are made consistently regardless of market conditions and particularly in volatile markets can result in a lower average cost per share compared to lump-sum investing.\n- Treasury gets diversified, an overall long-term goal of the treasury guild to build a more resilient treasury where capital is best preserved.\n- Thresholds’ own thUSD protocol gets used by Threshold, a solid use case example and strong marketing message for the whole market.\n- Getting paid in stablecoin allows each collaborator to choose their exposure.\n- If tBTC continues its upward trend: then the DAO sells a part of its tBTC, repays the loan and keeps the rest. Overall treasury value and resiliency increases. At the same time with debt paid down tBTC is released from the Vault and can be put to work to generate additional income.\n\nThe potential operation considerations of this process are:\n\n- Increased complexity of monthly operations\n- Active debt management would need to be performed\n- The DAO would need stables in reserve to handle sporadic loan repayments to avoid pitfalls of market drawdowns and manage decreasing collateral ratios\n- The DAO may lose BTC exposure if a vault gets redeemed\n\nFor more context and details please read up the complete proposal on the forum.",

It synergizes well with tBTC and has substantial potential for economic growth (for reference, Liquity’s revenue to date exceeds $34 million) and significant impact on the DAO.\n\nCurrently there are too few individuals focused on matters specifically related to thUSD. For example, ongoing internal discussions suggest the need to hire a dedicated individual for product marketing of the thUSD product. Equally important is delving into the details of Liquity version 2, exploring options to enhance the protocol, and considering the addition of an interest rate.\n\nIt is clear there is a need for a dedicated group that discusses, decides, and oversees the thUSD protocol. This proposal will let the DAO decide on the creation of a DAO-empowered thUSD steering committee.\n\nSuggested Structure and Responsibilities of the Committee\nThis oversight committee would be a group of five active cross-guild DAO members that would be responsible for:\n\nSteering the protocol\n- Overseeing Growth & Development roles in their intersection with thUSD\n- Discussing and deciding on overall protocol strategy, roadmap, focus and resource allocation\n- Appointing, monitoring and reviewing the activities of a new thUSD Product Marketing role (separate proposal) and/or any other needed role.",

      "content": "This Snapshot vote is to ratify a Threshold Treasury Guild committee recommendation to update the terms of agreement with market maker Sense Capital as follows: \n\n\"The Threshold Treasury Guild committee recommends reducing the 3rd and last BTC collateral requirement (Sense has posted the 1st two, totaling 12 BTC) outlined above (see: TIP 46: Defi Liquidity Bootstrap and Growth Part I - Market Maker - #7 by sensecapital ) by 50% (to 4.5 BTC) and breaking it into 3 monthly posts.\n\nRationale: in addition to changing market conditions in the last year (price of BTC was ~$28k when TIP-46 went to Governor Bravo vote March 31st last year) Taylor and @sensecapital have gone above and beyond to promote tBTC from a liquidity perspective, as well as champion us to his network. Their liquidity allocations have been instrumental in our growth and continue to drive volume and growth for Threshold.\n\nSpecifically, we ask the DAO to ratify these changes to the original terms of TIP-46 as follows:\n\nCollateral requirement for stage three T token optional grant has reduced from 9 BTC to 4.5 BTC\n\nSense will post 1.5 BTC collateral to TTG treasury wallet each month for 3 months, starting from the 25M T token transfer (post ratification of this via Snapshot)\n\nStrike price of 3rd leg of 25M T token shall be set based on 7-day moving average of daily close price as per original proposal\n\nGiven this is a modification based on recommendation of TTG committee entrusted with management of this partnership, I will go ahead and post this to Snapshot - but if anyone has any questions or concerns, please respond here or in Discord.

      "title": "TIP-073: Threshold Marketing Restructuring and Senior Lead Role",
      "content": "Vote Type\n\nToken holder DAO Snapshot with a 5-day vote period\n\nDAO-elected Sponsors\n\nJohn Packel, @Gorkem, Ashley (@MrsNuBooty)\n\nTimeline\n\n- 7 days for comment/discussion on this proposal\n- Token holder DAO Snapshot with a 5-day vote period\nPurpose\n\nThis proposal calls for Threshold to upgrade its marketing capability by making 3 structural changes: hire a senior marketing lead, ask the Keep and NuCypher teams to each contribute 5 hours per week to oversight, alignment and updates, and re-focus the current marketing lead role on executing social media and content\n\nMotivation\n\n- Threshold’s Marketing Guild has gone through several iterations since its founding 2 years ago. In April 2023 the DAO approved TIP-49 to restructure the committee, and then TIP-50 in May, which created the DAO’s Marketing Lead role.\n\n- It was evident to several of us at the time that a single resource working 30 hours per week would be challenged to not only execute on all the deliverables outlined but also field new requests from the DAO and contributor teams (Keep, NuCypher and those working on thUSD), plus work to maintain communication and alignment with those teams and the guilds.\n\n- In terms of developing Threshold marketing strategy and priorities, the 6-month plan Ashley and John created and posted in response to Forum responses requesting clarity on the role’s deliverables included 3 top goals (“Expanded tBTC awareness enabling growth”, “Successful launches of thUSD and Threshold Access Control”, “Compelling, clear & unified Threshold brand presence, messaging & content”), as well as a need to, “Source & review proposals from marketing/communications professionals for content, SEO, and other marketing opportunities”.\n\n- The latter proved difficult to achieve, but even if we had more outsourced contributors there would still be a need today for a senior marketing professional to conduct a fresh review of current priorities, activities and impact in order to develop and implement an overall marketing strategy and execution plan based on where Threshold is in 2024 and where we need to go.\n\nScope\n\nWe propose that Threshold upgrade its marketing capability by making 3 structural changes:\n\n1. Source a senior marketing lead (contractor ~25 hours/week) via a formal search process\n\nWe need a dynamic, leadership-oriented, crypto-native contractor to effectively create and guide the DAO’s marketing strategy, as well as lead cross-functional work streams in alignment with stakeholders. This requires a significant level of experience and track record in various aspects of marketing and growth, including product and digital marketing, acquisition, activation, and retention. The expectations associated with such a senior position are understandably high, especially considering the scope of responsibilities and the impact on the DAO’s success (see recruitment outlined in the Proposed Process section below):\n\n- Defining, activating and engaging high value communities with Threshold Network. This includes finding high-ROI places to drive awareness and establish long lasting relationships with those communities\n- Strategic thinking and planning, to provide a deeper understanding of audience engagement and interaction\n- Measurement and data-driven impact assessments based on who our audiences are, what goals each piece of content aims to achieve, and how to measure and capture further engagement\n- Clear ROI-based initiatives (including sourcing outside expertise and execution as needed) that demonstrate the value of our efforts and spend, as well as provide valuable insights for future planning\n- Alignment with overall product roadmap and goals, reflecting product development stages and marketing goals that includes distribution, content and social media strategies\n- Defining content calendar, writing content pieces or outsourcing when required\n- Stakeholder management and leading cross-functional work streams via strong project management and operations skills\n- Experience with brand marketing and partnerships, weaving together multifaceted campaigns, as well as crisis communications\nIt is critical that this person be willing, able and eager to execute some of the required tasks on their own, both because we need more “doers” and because Threshold has many expenses and demands continue to grow. Recommended compensation: DAO standard $85/hr.\n\n2. Ask the Keep and NuCypher teams to each contribute 5 hours per week for strategic oversight, alignment and product updates\n\nWhile we have tried various forms of weekly marketing sessions that included Keep and NuCypher representatives in managing priorities/progress, content/messaging, DAO alignment, etc., we need to establish a consistent cadence of input on priorities, updates on product strategy and development, as well as feedback on messaging and other product marketing efforts. While a major focus of the meeting(s) and input would initially be on sourcing and evaluating candidates for the senior marketing contractor, once that person is in role this can shift to helping them get up to speed and providing inputs as they develop the strategy and updated tactics. After that, the ongoing weekly contribution can settle into providing product updates and insights, giving input on priorities and messaging.\n\n3. Re-focus Ashley’s role on executing social media and content\n\nThreshold needs a lot more focus on social media and content than one person is able to provide while doing as many other things as we’ve tasked Ashley within her current role. “Crypto Twitter” is a critical vehicle for awareness, and ideally we’d have a full-time role focused on social media. By bringing in a senior contractor to provide the services described above, we can allow Ashley to focus exclusively on social media messaging and content creation - based on the strategy to be developed and with ongoing input from Keep and NuCypher.\n\nProposed Process\n\nUpon posting this proposal, commence weekly meeting with representatives from Keep and NuCypher, plus Ashley and John, to discuss the new role recruitment process, align on interim priorities for Ashley’s current focus and address marketing-related issues that arise (then oversee the selection process, assuming approval)\n\nRecruitment process that thoroughly assesses the necessary skills and experience (we propose that Gorkem be the point person managing this process):\n\n- Write role description and post as reply to this Forum post\n- Align on screening and interview questions - to be used by all, for consistency\n- Initial screening call with a defined person\n- Interview with the Keep, NuCypher and DAO representatives\n- Session for candidate to present their case study (open to the DAO)\n- Assess cultural fit with the extensive DAO\n- Marketing Guild Committee makes offer and we prepare onboarding\n\nProcess timeline\n\n- Commence weekly meeting immediately\n- Align on role description within 3 days, post it and solicit candidates\n- Post this proposal to Snapshot in 7 days\n- Begin interview process once Snapshot quorum reached (unless significant votes against)\n- Aim to have candidate selected by Feb. 20th so that person can attend ETH Denver and meet stakeholders in person",

      "content": "TL;DR:\nThis proposal would extend TIP-045 (TIP-045: Bootstrap Node Proposal v2) for 6 months, introducing no changes for this extension.\n\nBackground:\nAs outlined in the proposal (TIP-054), bootstrap nodes are of critical importance to the tBTC network. Currently, three professional providers are hosting 2 bootstrap nodes each. Over the past year, all up-time requirements were met by the chosen providers. TIP-045 passed in January 2023 and is due to be renewed or revised.\n\nThe Integrations Guild believes that the best course of action is to temporarily extend the terms of TIP-045 to maintain the current status quo to give dev teams time to complete significant upgrades to the tBTC client. These upgrades are expected to be completed in 6 to 9 months.\n\nLooking Ahead:\nThese major upgrades to the client will retire the beta-staker program, which is an opportunity to reevaluate the bootstrap node agreements and potentially introduce community operated bootstrap nodes, as well as other professional operators.\n\nProposal:\nExtend the terms of TIP-045 for 6 months, starting February 2024. Each provider, Boar, P2P, and Staked, will continue to receive $10,000 per month in T. If upgrades to the tBTC client are not completed in 6 months, this proposal may be extended up to two times by an additional 3 months each.",

      "content": "This is a Threshold DAO temp check snapshot. If passed this proposal will move onto Governor Bravo. \n\nNote: Following valuable feedback from the DAO community, we acknowledge that the TACo Integration for Embody represents a unique venture, diverging from the projects typically funded by the Threshold DAO. We view this as an opportunity for long-term ROI, advocating for the funding of this integration as a means to test TACo in a practical, real-world setting. We aim to address a tangible problem and demonstrate TACo’s efficacy in a production level environment outside of the traditional blockchain ecosystem. Additionally, it’s important to emphasize that our proposal centers on the development of an open-source social communication infrastructure built on TACo. This infrastructure is not just a singular solution but a reusable foundation, designed to foster ongoing innovation and utility within the Threshold DAO ecosystem and beyond. The open-source nature of this project ensures that the benefits and learnings derived from this integration can be widely adopted and adapted, furthering the Threshold DAO’s mission of pioneering in decentralized solutions.\nProject Summary\n\nOur team is excited to propose the integration of TACo (Threshold Access Control) into Embody, the most privacy-forward and comprehensive period tracking app ever built. This integration is especially crucial in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to end the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, which has heightened menstruators’ concerns about the security of data collected by period-tracking tools and its potential misuse. More specifically, we are looking to build the Inner Circle feature, an online community space where menstruators can securely discuss and share their experiences. Through the integration of TACo, Embody’s Inner Circle gains the advantage of its robust security features but also actively contributes to the advancement of the TACo ecosystem.\n\nThe full proposal is viewable on the forum 👇 \n\nhttps://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-070-enhancing-menstrual-health-privacy-embodys-inner-circle-and-taco-integration/769/25",

      "content": "Purpose\nThis proposal requests the Threshold DAO to approve the transition of part of the responsibilities for the DAO Growth Coordinator Contractor Role to Ethan.\n\nSap recently announced that they will step down from their current role of Growth Coordinator (TIP 52: Contractor role for DAO Growth Coordinator), which leaves the DAO with a need for an ongoing relationship management and integrations lead. This proposal recommends that @eh_ethan assumes the Ecosystem Integrations responsibilities for up to a total of 20 hours per week.\n\nSap will continue to maintain the Liquidity Strategy responsibilities.\n\nEthan’s role on the Integrations Guild, supporting the DAO in generating and executing upon tBTC integrations for the past 10 months, makes them principally qualified to take on the role.\n\nMotivation\nWith tBTC’s use and adoption growing steadily since inception, the recent launch on TACo and with the upcoming launch of thUSD, there is still an implicit need for the Growth Coordinator Role. With Sap having to step back from his commitment, this role would cover the following areas:\n\nEcosystem Integrations\nDiverse use cases for tBTC and Threshold products are required to drive adoption, although relationship development takes time. Currently, the attention of the Integrations Guild is divided between essential DAO operational tasks and outreach, and would benefit from a dedicated position to manage relationships.\n\nDocumentation and UX\n\nAs we scale and our product user base grows, documentation related to tBTC and other Threshold products use cases and deployment options becomes increasingly important. Those involved on the front line of protocol integrations are well positioned to create documentation of this nature and to participate in DAO efforts to deploy UX improvements, such as a tBTC use cases dashboard.\n\nScope\nThe scope of this role will be a 20-hour/week Growth Lead role at Threshold DAO, remunerated at the DAO’s contractor rate of $85/h.\n\nThe position will have the following responsibilities:\n\nEcosystem Integrations\n\nCreate new relationships and opportunities for the Threshold product suite.\nLead protocol onboarding of Threshold products.\nCoordinate with the Marketing Guild to amplify and promote new integrations.\nManage and maintain ecosystem relationships.\nWrite outbound governance proposals for key tBTC, thUSD and TACo integrations.\nSponsor and support interested protocols to seek partnerships via the forum.\nStructure a pipeline for inbound integrations and partnerships, creating an easy access point for any party interested in integrating Threshold Network products.\nSupporting the IG with TACo integrations\nDocumentation and UX\n\nCollect and maintain a list of live tBTC, thUSD and TACo integrations and pools.\nWrite documentation to collate key DAO metadata, integrations and pools.\nSupport DAO UX improvement initiatives, such as tBTC integration’s public dashboard.\nUpdate and maintain tBTC, thUSD and T token registries and lists.\nOversight & Review\nThe Growth Coordinator role will operate under the oversight of the Threshold Integrations Guild (TIG). The position and performance will be reviewed on a quarterly basis by the TIG, upon delivery of a self-evaluation to the committee.\n\nKPIs\nIt was determined that volume-based KPI metrics don’t necessarily align to ideal DAO outcomes. Quality relationships are preferred over a quantity of low-value relationships, and governance cycles differ from protocol to protocol.\n\nTherefore, the performance of this position will be determined based on committee review of a self-reported quarterly summary of work achieved, based on the scope listed above.\n\nThat being said, key areas of assessment will be:\n\nSuccessful development of tBTC, thUSD and TACo use cases across chains.\nProactive, quality, relationship development.\nOngoing relationship and integration management with DAO partners.\nCoordination between DAO guilds and other growth initiatives.\nNumber of tBTC and thUSD minted.\nVariety of tBTC and thUSD use cases.\nTransfer of responsibility\nGiven this has been posted on the forum on 19th January 2024 Ethan would look to take over the responsibilities in full from 1st February 2024 (5 days for comment, then a 7 day vote period via snapshot). From the week beginning 22nd January 2024, Ethan would look to take over the responsibilities of the DAO Growth Coordinator role in the interim period.\n\nRecommendation\nWe recommend that Threshold DAO contract with Ethan for a 6-month renewable period working 20 hours/week at a rate of $85 USD per hour.\n\nGiven the variable nature of the time requirements for this role, as suggested by other members of the Integrations Guild Committee, Ethan would retain their hours on the TIG, and bill any additional hours up to 20 hours/week. This allows more flexibility for the time demands that DAO integrations bring.\n\nShould Ethan not be re-elected in the upcoming Threshold Integrations Guild elections, they would retain the sole responsibilities and hours of the DAO Growth Coordinator position.\n\nWhy Ethan\nSince joining the Integrations Guild, Ethan has explicitly exhibited their ability to perform at all stages of the integration process, from developing a universe of potential integrations across multiple verticals and multiple chains, through to onboarding of tBTC to the protocol, and then engaging in co-marketing.\n\nEthan has several years of experience working within Digital Asset investment management, for which he has attained a high-level understanding of blockchain technology and use cases, resulting in an acute ability to spot uses for tBTC.\n\nGiven the strong passion for growing the reach of Threshold products, Ethan is a disciplined and motivated individual who works independently and effectively.\n\nEthan is an active contributor to Threshold and has thus far contributed the following to Threshold DAO:\n\nElected member of Threshold Integrations Guild.\nGenerated ecosystem lists for thUSD (mainnet), tBTC (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Polygon and Solana) and for Pyth integrations.\nWritten retrospective reports reporting Threshold Integration Guild’s performance to the community over the past year.\nEither led or been involved in the majority of integrations that has led tBTC to reach the 60m USD TVL that it currently stands at.\nUpdating token listings, to ensure a fluid perception of tBTC across all platforms.",

      "content": "This is a temp check snapshot.\n\nProject Summary\n\nCurrently, tBTC minting is limited to the Threshold Dashboard, restricting its accessibility to a broader audience. Additionally, users tend to engage more with processes on platforms they are already familiar with. By integrating the tBTC minting process into Taho, a well-known community-owned web3 wallet, we can not only capitalize on existing user familiarity but also significantly broaden the accessibility of tBTC minting, promoting its wider adoption in the crypto community.\n\nOur specific plan involves prioritizing design work and incorporating the tBTC SDK, which will be the first of its kind in an external product, thereby battle-testing the SDK. By capitalizing on Taho’s established trust with its users, we aim to transition a notable segment to the Threshold platform, simplifying the minting process and bridging the technical divide. Taho currently has over 100,000 monthly active users, with a recent survey indicating that 80% of these users are actively engaged in DeFi activities.\n\nWe are requesting $189,000 over the duration of 5-6 months to achieve the following key milestones:\n\nMilestone 1 - Complete UX/UI Design of tBTC minting in Taho\n\nMilestone 2 - Prototype SDK integration, Test SDK & Doc Improvement\n\nMilestone 3 - Integrate tBTC Minting in Taho\n\nAll work produced during this project will be open source, allowing other wallets and developers to access and build upon our contributions.\n\nThe full proposal is found on the Threshold Governance forum.",

      "content": "Vote Type\nToken holder DAO Snapshot with a 7-day vote period.\n\nDAO-elected Sponsors\n@sap, @JohnPackel, @Eastban\n\nTimeline\n5 days for comment / discussion on this proposal.\nToken holder DAO Snapshot with a 7-day vote period.\n\nProposal\nReduce tBTC mint fee to 0%, and reduce redemption fee to 0% for 60 days.\n\nAfter 60 days, mint and redemption fees will be reinstated at their current values of 0.1% mint and 0.2% redemption.\n\nBackground\nThis proposal suggests a temporary pause of the tBTC mint fee, and a reduction of the redemption fee, to eliminate friction for new users of tBTC and enable new utility and use cases.\n\ntBTC is at a crucial inflection point in its growth trajectory. Liquidity and TVL have grown steadily since launch, but mainstream DeFi use cases, such as lending markets and derivative trading, are pending an increase in TVL and volume.\n\nRationale\nThreshold DAO currently charges a 0.1% mint fee, and a 0.2% redemption fee, which imposes a cost to DeFi users that wish to mint tBTC, and a spread between the tBTC and BTC price for traders. This reduces the amount of capital that can flow into tBTC, as well as the likelihood of arbitrage opportunities for tBTC traders and bots.\n\nA pause of the bridge fees will enable new tBTC to enter the system, and reduce tBTC and BTC spread. This allows users that want to earn BTC yield to do so without reducing their principal, as well as market makers to quote tighter spreads, and provide more liquidity with confidence.\n\nA short term reduction in fees will allow tBTC to reach the critical mass required for mainstream DeFi use cases.\n\nConsiderations\nA valid concern of a reduction of bridge fees is that it removes the disincentive of tBTC redemption, which could allow tBTC supply to be drained.\n\nOther considerations on the dynamics of fee reduction in the face of a drain attack:\n\nA symmetrical advantage. Traders that want to redeem tBTC to arbitrage create demand for tBTC, which motivates tBTC mints.\nLP Incentives. tBTC has constant demand pressure from T token LP incentives. If tBTC LP TVL reduces, APY increases.\nSingle-sided deposit bonuses. LPs are incentivised to return stable pools to a balanced position, which creates an additional incentive to mint and deposit tBTC.\nNo change in fundamentals. tBTC allows BTC users to grow their BTC holdings. Users sidelined due to the mint fee will be able to enter the system without cost.\n\nOutcomes\nThe desired outcome of the fee holiday is to encourage new tBTC into the system, and create opportunities for interchain arbitrage, to boost tBTC volume. The goal is to enable new tBTC use cases with leading DeFi protocols.\n\nExecution and Timing\ntBTC fees can be adjusted by the Threshold Council with a delay of 48 hours, before the fee change can be finalised.\n\nOnce the fee update has been executed, the fee holiday will commence and remain in place for 60 days.\n\nThere will be a similar delay to reintroduce fees, which means the process to reintroduce fees will commence after ~58 days.\n\nThe proposal can be accompanied by a “tBTC Holiday Season” type campaign, to spread the word of the reduction in fees over end of solar and lunar year holidays.",

      "title": "TIP-064: Sunsetting explicit tBTC coverage pool contracts ",
      "content": "Threshold’s coverage pool contracts are designed to provide an insurance backstop against potential losses in the Bitcoin collateral backing tBTC. However, it’s clear that T-only coverage pools are a sub-optimal solution given the inherent relationship between tBTC and T. In case of a BTC collateral loss event, it’s likely that T would experience a significant price impact, reducing it’s effectiveness as an insurance backstop.\n\nFar better are coverage pools with exogenous assets that are not correlated with tBTC (i.e. ETH, ETH LSTs, BTC).\n\nHowever, naively deploying coverage pools with exogenous assets is unlikely to be the best approach. Since coverage pool liquidations are not automated but rather require the intervention of a risk manager (currently the Treasury Guild), it’s unnecessary to deposit those assets into a coverage pool contract. Instead, they can be more deployed into various DeFi strategies to earn yield for the DAO.\n\nWith this in mind, I propose sunsetting the explicit coverage pool contracts in favor of moving to an “implicit coverage pool” model where tBTC is backed by the full faith and credit of Threshold DAO (that is, by its treasury assets, which currently include T, ETH, wBTC, tBTC, stablecoins, CVX, veCRV, and associated LP tokens, etc.\n\nThese assets are held primarily in three locations:\n\n- GovernorBravo timelock controller\n- Council multisig\n- Treasury Guild multisig\n\nIn the event of a collateral loss event, these assets can be used to cover the loss by the risk manager in an orderly manner.",

The 50m extra T required to pay out the bonus will either be drawn from an already approved minting round, or be added to the next mint proposal – both of which follow the normal token-holder governance process. \n\nWatch the recent Staker Townhall to learn why the staker community will benefit from TACo becoming a Threshold app. Staker Townhall: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-xJeNYo87k",

      "content": "This is a snapshot temp check. If successful this proposal will move into a DAO Governor Bravo cycle before being successfully ratified by the DAO.\n\nPlease read: \n\nThis temp check is for the following proposal with option 2 \"Threshold to provide 75M T, Flowdesk to run a twap/vwap sell program to fund the other leg used for MM\" and the option for the DAO monthly payment to occur with USDC. This partnership will occur with Threshold Treasury Guild oversight meaning any minor adjustments to strategies provided in the proposal can be approved by the Threshold Treasury Guild. \n\nOverview:\n\nFlowdesk is the leading regulated digital assets Market Making as-a-Service infrastructure provider for token issuers, exchanges, and institutions. Our model offers token issuers a fully transparent and capital-efficient approach to managing liquidity on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. We enable our clients to directly manage their own capital, while giving them access to our OTC and execution services supported by our global trading desk.\n\nOur Market-Making as-a-Service model has been designed to improve trust, control, and fairness. We trade with the token issuer’s capital and are compensated with a flat retainer fee, solving for misalignment of incentives. This has several advantages:\n\n- Full control over the trading strategy\n- Comprehensive set of data & analytics to facilitate reporting\n- On-the-fly parameter adjustment\n- Trade and custody assets with a regulated counterparty\n- Better forecasting of costs\n\nWe are not a hedge fund or a prop desk, which gives comfort to our more than 100 clients that we will never trade against them or engage in controversial market behaviors. This is backed by robust internal conflict of interest policies\n\nFull proposal details are available on the governance forum here:",

      "content": "This is a temp check. If passed the proposal will proceed to the Threshold DAO GB. \n\nVote Type:\nToken holder DAO Governor Bravo Proposal\n\nDAO Elected Representative Sponsors:\nSap, Will\n\nOverview:\ntBTC has successfully launched on Solana, but with limited usage and in competition with existing efforts to bring native wBTC to Solana. There exists an opportunity now for a first mover advantage to establish tBTC as the new canonical BTC on Solana. To do that, the cold start problem for tBTC TVL and volume on Solana needs to be addressed immediately with new protocol integrations that increase the liquidity & utility of tBTC as collateral.\n\nThis is a proposal for the Threshold DAO to engage in a partnership with Mango & Dual DAO to deliver products supported by CKS Systems liquidity to bootstrap TVL for tBTC across the Solana DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThese protocols are better together and a more liquid BTC market on Solana via tBTC is collectively beneficial for T, MNGO, DUAL and even SOL. By making this benefit clear to the respective communities it’s possible to engage a positive feedback loop to grow tBTC. The proposed deal structure is designed with this in mind and includes treasury swaps in the form of on-chain call options to formalize the relationship of our mutual successes.\n\nFull proposal available on the forums:\n\nhttps://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-060-solana-growth-partnership/675",

It acts on behalf of Threshold DAO and its token holders.\n\nThe Threshold Foundation subsequently formed a subsidiary in the British Virgin Islands, Threshold BVI Ltd, wholly owner by the Threshold Foundation.\n\nSince Threshold Foundation takes direction from token holders, this proposal seeks authorization to follow token minting best practices and house token mints in the BVI subsidiary.\n\nOverall, the full functions to be housed in the new legal entities will be developed and likely evolve progressively.\n\nThis proposal is an attempt to move a basic function of the DAO, token minting, to the BVI subsidiary prior to the upcoming mint for staking rewards (see TIP-53).\n\nProposal\nThis proposal suggests to create a new multisig wallet for the BVI subsidiary, to house T token mints required by the stable yield model set out in TIP-003.\n\nThe new multisig will have the same signer set as the current Council multisig, with the addition of the Foundation Director, making it a 6-of-10 multisig.\n\nCurrently, new T for staking emissions are minted by a tokenholder vote and delivered to the Future Rewards contract (link 2) contract. The Future Rewards contract is used to top up the Claimable Rewards contract (link 1), which allows stakers to claim their rewards. Both contracts are currently controlled by the Threshold Council.\n\nControl and management of these contracts will be transferred to the new BVI multisig, to demonstrate that the BVI subsidiary is responsible for the minting and distribution of token emissions.\n\nThe BVI multisig will have the bi-monthly responsibility to transfer T from the Future Rewards contract to the Claimable Rewards contract, for the total amount of tokens earned by stakers in that period.\n\nNext Steps\n- New Ethereum Safe multisig to be created with the same signer set as the current Council, with the addition of the Foundation Director.\n\n- Future Rewards contract and Claimable Rewards contract ownership to be transferred from the Council to the new BVI multisig.",

      "title": "TIP-059 Establish a Bug Bounty Program for thUSD",
      "content": "Dear Threshold Community,\n\nAs part of our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security and reliability for the Threshold Network and its associated products, we are proposing the establishment of a public bug bounty program for the thUSD product that will be launched soon. This program aims to enhance the security posture of the network by incentivizing security experts to identify and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.\n\nBackground:\nThreshold Network has a history of successful audits by multiple third-party firms, as evidenced in the audits published on Threshold · About 1. Additionally, thUSD was successfully audited by the Cantina team, where the results are expected to be published soon. However, we believe it is essential to take further steps to fortify the security and reliability of this product.\n\nProposal Details:\nWe propose to collaborate again with Immunefi, a renowned web3 bug bounty platform, and our partner for the Threshold and tBTC Bug Bounty Program (see TIP-041 2 and Immunefi dashboard for Threshold).\n\nThis program would actively engage the white hat community in identifying security vulnerabilities within the thUSD product. The program is designed to encourage responsible disclosure, thereby enhancing the security of the network as a whole.\n\nThe reward structure needs to be designed by a work group of experts, so it will be subject to community and developer feedback, but can be initially expected to lay within this:\n\n- Critical: Up to $100,000 in T tokens\n- High: Up to $10,000 in T tokens\n- Medium: Up to $1,000 in T tokens\n- Low: Up to $500 in T tokens\n\nIt’s important to note that these reward amounts are subject to the Total Value Locked (TVL) in the network. In the event that the TVL experiences substantial growth, these amounts can be revisited and potentially increased.\n\nBenefits and Objectives:\n\n1. Enhanced Security: By leveraging the expertise of the white hat community, we aim to identify and address vulnerabilities in a proactive manner, safeguarding user assets and maintaining network integrity (see Guidelines and Rules).\n\n2. Responsible Disclosure: Encouraging responsible disclosure through the bug bounty program ensures that potential vulnerabilities are reported and addressed before they can be exploited maliciously.\n\n3. Community Engagement: The bug bounty program fosters a collaborative environment that aligns with the decentralized ethos of our network, encouraging active participation from community members and developers.\nBug Bounty Program Management:\n\nThe DAO contributors, with a special mention for the IG, have accumulated valuable experience through their involvement in the existing Bug Bounty program for Threshold. This program encompasses multiple assets within Threshold, as well as the tBTC product. This hands-on engagement has provided insights into the implementation and management of such initiatives.\n\nEffective Bug Bounty Program management entails two key challenges: (1) the technical evaluation of bug reports and subsequent bug mitigation strategies, and (2) overseeing the financial allocation of the program, including payments to whitehat participants and Immunefi.\n\nTo tackle challenge (1), we advocate for the establishment of a committee comprised of technical security experts. This committee’s role will encompass the prompt evaluation of reports and the formulation of tailored mitigation measures for the thUSD product.\n\nFor challenge (2), drawing from our past experiences, we propose that the initial phase of the thUSD program be overseen by the IG. We intend to allocate $100k in T tokens, allowing coverage for various minor incidents or a single major incident. Should these funds be exhausted, the IG will duly request additional funding from the DAO.\n\nFeedback and Approval Process for this Proposal:\n\nWe value the input of our community and developers. Before moving this proposal to a snapshot vote, we invite your feedback on the proposed reward amounts, program structure, and any other related aspects. Your insights will contribute to the finalization of this initiative.\n\nPlease share your thoughts, suggestions, and concerns in response to this proposal. Your feedback can be provided on this forum thread or during community meetings.\n\n[see comment history on the Forum here: https://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-059-establish-a-bug-bounty-program-for-thusd/661 ]",

If passed, this proposal will move into the Token Holder DAO Governor Bravo instance.\n\nThis proposal will result in a Threshold Treasury Guild spend approval on the DAO's tBTC accrued from network fees for the following purpose.\n\nBuyback and Make:\n\nI propose that accrued tBTC fees be periodically single-side deposited into a T/tBTC pool, effectively buying back T with deposit amounts and timing determined at the discretion of the treasury guild. \n\nAs tBTC fees grow, more and more T is bought back and locked in an DAO-owned LP position. These periodic buybacks will take T off the market, deepen T and tBTC liquidity, and further tie the successes of tBTC and T.\n\nThe pros and cons of this model, called “buyback and make”, are well covered by Joel Monegro at Placeholder 16.\n\nCreating a deep T/tBTC pool doesn’t only create stronger liquidity for the pair… it also becomes another revenue stream for the DAO. The Curve T/ETH pool 2 is projected to earn 46% APR next epoch, while the Balancer T/WETH pool earns 9.7-15.75%.\n\nFull details of TIP 54 Part 2 are on the governance forum here -\n\nhttps://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-54-tbtc-t-better-together/635",

      "content": "**Vote Type**\nToken holder DAO Snapshot with a 7-day vote period.\n\n**DAO-elected Sponsors**\nSap, East, Will\n\n**Timeline**\n7 days for comment / discussion on this proposal.\n\nToken holder DAO Snapshot with a 7-day vote period.\n\n**Purpose**\nThis proposal is a request to the Threshold DAO to approve the transfer of Council-held Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) to the Treasury Guild Committee’s Multisig.\n\n**Motivation**\nThe DAO’s Protocol Owned Liquidity has continued to grow, thanks to the TTG’s various diversification efforts, including the continued success of TIP 46 and TIP 47, as well as revenues from incentives directed at existing POL allocations.\n\nIn addition, the recently ratified TIP 55 has increased the capacity of the DAO to manage and optimise POL, with the creation of a specific POL Operations role.\n\nGiven the importance of POL to the continued growth of the DAO Treasury, this proposal suggests transferring certain strategic POL to the Threshold Treasury Guild Mutisig.\n\nThe TTG members are better equipped to validate and queue the transactions required for POL allocation and maintenance, which reduces the risk of error and increases POL security. Most POL recommendations come from TTG and are executed by Council, which creates inefficiency due to signer fatigue and information transfer requirements.\n\nAssets currently held by the Threshold Council can be viewed here: https://debank.com/profile/0x9f6e831c8f8939dc0c830c6e492e7cef4f9c2f5f 3\n\nAssets currently held by the Treasury Guild can be found here: https://debank.com/profile/0x71E47a4429d35827e0312AA13162197C23287546 1.\n\nTreasury Guild multi-sigs have a required signing majority of five-of-nine signers. Every six months, half of its members are elected by the DAO, and hold a year long tenure.\n\n**Recommendation**\nIt is the recommendation of the Treasury Guild to transfer the following assets to the Treasury Guild Multisig:\n\n* 122,226 CRV\n* 15,570 CVX (Unlocked)\n* 87,191 CVX (Locked)\n* 2,288 BAL\n* 16,407 cvxCRV\n* 7,769 AURA\n* 0.1044 tBTC\n* 162 cvxFXS\nCurrent 3BTC Curve LP tokens staked in Convex to the value of:\n - 3.307 tBTC\n - 0.855 WBTC\n - 0.91 sBTC\n\nThe total asset transfer will have an approximate value of $548,000 USD.\n\nCurrent T/ETH liquidity, T, ETH, and DAI will **remain** in custody of the Council:\n\n* 89,956,481 T\n* 2.03 ETH\n* 2,417 DAI\nCurrent T/ETH Curve LP tokens staked in Convex to the value of:\n - 213.36 ETH\n - 19,533,819 T\nCurrent T/ETH Curve LP tokens staked in Aura to the value of:\n - 77.78 ETH\n - 27,736,852 T",

      "content": "This is a temp check snapshot for TIP 58. If successful this proposal will move into a full Threshold DAO token holder DAO Governor Bravo cycle. \n\nSummary:\n\nThe Gauntlet team recently launched Aera, an autonomous treasury management protocol. This post is a temperature check to assess the community’s appetite to allocate funds to the Treasury Guild to trial Aera.\n\nOverview of Aera:\n\nAera is a solution for optimizing DAO funds autonomously and onchain. For most DAOs, treasury funds (e.g. reserves, treasuries, safety modules) are not actively managed or adjusted based on market conditions. For DAOs, this can lead to an inability to maintain runway, cover liabilities, and benefit from growth in the market. Traditional institutions can allocate funds to more nimble managers who make day-to-day decisions, but DAOs face challenges with this model such as cumbersome governance, incentive alignment and trust with external managers.\n\nAera provides DAOs with a non-custodial solution for managing treasury funds efficiently and transparently. The Aera protocol consists of vaults, which are constructed on a per-protocol basis and can hold various digital assets. The portfolio strategy of the vault is determined by us and is highly customizable. Strategies can range from simply keeping fund proportions in line with liabilities, to complex strategies using Liquidity positions to provide POL.\n\nVaults are automatically rebalanced by Vault Guardians who compete onchain to propose the best combination of assets in the portfolio.\n\nFull Details for this proposal including Motivation, Implementation, FAQs and more is found on the governance forums here -\n\nhttps://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-058-pilot-aera-for-threshold/658",

      "content": "Brief\n\nThe Threshold Integrations Guild is requesting discretionary funding of USD $61,500 per quarter, for a total of $123,000 for the remaining two quarters from the Threshold Treasury.\n\nThis budget would primarily be utilized for, but not limited to:\n\nDeveloper grants for integrations\nFunds for development of tBTC/thUSD portal site\nSupport other products getting ready to launch\nThreshold Support Moderator\nDAO tooling & applications\n\nIntegrations Guild Goals\n\nThe Integrations Guild's original main objective has been to support Threshold's flagship products and integrate them into different L1 and L2 protocols within the DeFi space. This portfolio is rapidly expanding with the planned additions of thUSD and Threshold Access Control.\n\nBesides this the Integrations Guild has gradually taken on an increased scope with coordination of setting up the Immunefi bug bounty program and organizing developer grants for developments that led to tools such as https://tbtcscan.com/. Additionally, the IG also owns the DAO Technical Support role and managed the development of the subgraph.\n\nUse of Proceeds\n\nFunds will be managed under the IG multi-sig. The following are the main areas of how the IG will be spending these funds:\n\nDeveloper grants for integrations\nContinued tBTC integrations efforts\nFunding the development of a tBTC/thUSD portal\nDevelop Threshold product expansions\nThreshold Support Moderator (existing contractor role, see CP-004)\nTools used by the DAO such as Notion and other software\n\nDeveloper Grants/tBTC Integration Efforts\nGrants used to encourage integrating Threshold products, such as tBTC, thUSD (after it launches).\n\ntBTC/thUSD Portal\n\nThis project is in its early stages and aims to create a comprehensive resource. The resource will be hosted on a subdomain of the Threshold main site, and its primary goal is to list various opportunities for using the relevant service offering. These opportunities may include aggregated yield-earning options for tBTC, incentivized pools, and more.\n\nThreshold Product Expansions\n\nThe IG budget will provide funding for web development as needed. An example of these efforts is development of the delegate dashboard, which the IG oversaw. \n\nThreshold Support Moderator\n\nOngoing contractor role established through CP-004 to provide support function in Discord.\n\nDAO Tools\n\nFunds to be spent on tools for DAO usage such as Notion and other subscription based services.\n\nExpiry / Timing of Initial Funding Spend\n\nThe allocated funds will not have an expiry date, and there won't be an estimate provided for when they will be fully spent. The IG assures that these funds will be allocated prudently and responsibly, focusing on activities that align with its mission.\n\nFunding\n\nWe respectfully request that the Treasury Guild initiates the transfer of $123,000 USD equivalent in T to the IG Multisig no later than 5 days after this budget is approved. Additionally, we ask that if the amount received by the IG is more than 4% below the initially requested budget, the Treasury Guild performs a singular \"top-off\" transaction to reconcile the deficit.",

      "title": "TIP 55: Contractor role for POL Operations Coordinator",
      "content": "Vote Type\nToken holder DAO Snapshot with a 7-day vote period.\n\nDAO-elected Sponsors\n@ben @JohnPackel @Sap @jakelynch\n\nTimeline\n - 7 days for comment / discussion on this proposal\n - Token holder DAO Snapshot with a 7-day vote period\n\nDefinitions\nProtocol Owned Liquidity (POL)\nAssets owned and controlled by the DAO that are used to provide liquidity.\n\nPurpose\nThis proposal is a request to the Threshold DAO to fund a POL Operations Coordinator role for the purpose of overseeing all operations for the DAO’s Protocol Owned Liquidity. This proposal recommends East as a candidate for the position.\n\nMotivation\nThreshold Treasury Guild has become an important working unit in the DAO. The guild was created and empowered by the DAO to work towards a strong, diversified and resilient treasury portfolio, to grow protocol owned liquidity, and to manage incentives for Threshold services and products…\n\nManagement of these activities requires heavy involvement of the guild’s committee members. The successful launch of tBTC, new exciting proposals, and the DAO’s expansion to L2s and other chains creates a persistent workload for the TTG. It is obvious that specialized roles with more time allocation are necessary. Roles such as Growth Lead (Incentives and Expansion) , POL Operations, Chairman (Meetings, Agenda, Moderation, Structure) and Finances (Accounting, Report, Payroll) are evident posts.\n\nIn practical terms this means that the TTG will continue to provide the strategy and oversight for the treasury with its 9 seated committee multisig as the core security mechanism empowered by the DAO.\n\nThe POL Operations Coordinator specialized role has the intention to increase TTG’s bandwidth by focusing on the following areas:\n\n1. POL management\n\nThe DAO’s Protocol Owned Liquidity primarily consists of its governance token, T. This POL is deployed across several pools on Mainnet like the Curve T/ETH pool and the Balancer T/ETH 80-20 pool.\n\nThe DAO recently increased the number of tBTC pools across multiple DEXs on L2s with active incentives deployed to several. In addition to tBTC, the T token’s presence expanded to L2. Past and current diversification efforts and reward harvest increased the number of other assets in DAOs treasury, such as CVX, BAL, ETH, tBTC, WBTC, CRV, AURA, etc. All of these assets require a constant overview and active management.\n\n2. Budget Overview and Execution\nThe Threshold Treasury Guild’s Budget has evolved and includes multiple line items (incentives, comps, expenses, allocations for diversification, etc.) that need management. The operations involved are rather complex to follow, require significant attention, coordination and collaboration with other specialized roles to ensure proper execution.\n\n3. Successful Multisig Operations\n\nContracts, dApps, POL, diversification efforts and Budget require multiple constant multisig transactions which need to be addressed in a timely fashion. These operations call for knowledge of protocols and dApps, and should be reinforced with the occasional coordination with other expert members of the DAO.\n\nScope\nThe scope of this role will be a 20-hour/week POL Operations role at Threshold DAO, remunerated at the DAO’s contractor rate of $85/h.\n\nThe position will have the following responsibilities:\n\n- Assist DAO decision-making to deploy POL\n- Track POL assets allocation\n- Monitor yield on existing POL\n- Research new alternatives for POL\n- Analyze diversification alternatives\n- Work on UniV3 (e.g. Arrakis, Sense)\n- Research and test Limit Order capabilities for the DAO (e.g. CowSwap, 1inch)\n- Discuss and setup T to ETH transactions\n- Collaborate on the preparation and execution of new initiatives (e.g. Bonds, 8020 pools)\n- Track and set up Harvest rewards and loan repayment transactions\n- Track Voting Power, governance token assets and allocation\n- Vote with delegated governance tokens on behalf of the DAO\n- Budget preparation, discussion and ratification with TTG\n- Budget analysis and tracking\n- Research new software tools and dApps for multisig optimization\n- Analyze contracts codes and build JSONs to further automate transactions\n- Collaborate and coordinate with TTG and Council on diverse multisig transactions\n\nOversight & Review\nThe POL Operations Coordinator role will operate under the oversight of the Threshold Treasury Guild (TTG) and execute on decisions made by the TTG. The position and performance will be reviewed on a quarterly basis by the TTG, upon delivery of a self-evaluation to the committee.\n\nThe performance of this position will be determined based on committee review of a self reported quarterly summary of work achieved, based on the scope listed above.\n\nKey areas of assessment will be:\nPOL overview report\nBudget review and oversight\nDiversification summary\nRecommendation\nRecommendation is that Threshold DAO contracts with East for a 6-month renewable period working 20 hours/week at a rate of $85 USD per hour, starting August 2023.\n\nBackground\nWith a track record of launching and developing Guilds and their strategies, East has demonstrated the necessary motivation, capability, and experience in this role. He has past experience in business management and development, product launches, and board of director roles.\n\nEast is an active contributor to Threshold, past contributor to Keep Network and other DAOs such as Taho, and has thus far contributed the following to Threshold DAO:\n\n- Former elected member of Threshold Council.\n\n- Elected member of Threshold Treasury Guild since inception.\n\n- Elected member of Threshold Integrations Guild since inception.\n\n- Delivered Threshold Treasury Guild reports to the DAO several times.\n\n- active engagement on current multisig transactions deployment.\n\n- Elaborated TTG’s budget on several occasions.\n\n- Participated in numerous integrations such as Arrakis, Curve and Aura.",

Sap’s current roles on the Integrations Guild and Treasury Guild uniquely position them at the core intersection of Threshold Growth - ecosystem relationships and DAO finances.\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is not to replace current initiatives of the community, rather, to augment and support them.\n\nMotivation\nWith the successful launch of tBTC, and the upcoming launch of the thUSD and TACo products, the timing has never been better to grow tBTC usability and adoption.\n\nFor this reason, a concerted business development effort has never been more appropriate.\n\nThe intention of this role is to increase DAO bandwidth in the following areas:\n\n1. Liquidity Strategy\n\nThe DAO has recently massively increased the number of tBTC pools across multiple DEXs on EVM L2s, with Solana and Base to follow shortly. In addition, the T token itself is required on L2s in order to incentivize key pools.\n\nthUSD is approaching launch, at which point a similar strategy will be required.\n\nThe deployment, management of associated relationships, liquidity incentivization and performance reporting for the numerous pools require significant attention and coordination.\n\n2. Ecosystem Integrations\nDiverse use cases for tBTC and Threshold products are required to drive adoption, although relationship development takes time. Currently, the attention of the Integrations Guild is divided between essential DAO operational tasks and outreach, and would benefit from a dedicated position to manage relationships.\n\n3. Documentation and UX\n\nAs we scale and our product user base grows, documentation related to tBTC use cases and deployment options becomes increasingly important. Those involved on the front line of protocol integrations are well positioned to create documentation of this nature and to participate in DAO efforts to deploy UX improvements, such as a tBTC use cases dashboard.\n\nScope\nThe scope of this role will be a 30-hour/week Growth Lead role at Threshold DAO, remunerated at the DAO’s contractor rate of $85/h.\n\nThe position will have the following responsibilities:\n\nLiquidity Strategy\n\nManage tBTC pool and incentives deployment across new chains.\nCollaborate with DEX launch partners.\nDeploy, monitor and report liquidity incentives and performance.\nManage T token deployment across multiple chains.\nEstablish an incentives budget and ratify it with the Treasury Guild.\nAssist DAO decision-making to deploy pools and POL.\nDevelop and deploy a thUSD liquidity strategy.\nEcosystem Integrations\n\nCreate new relationships and opportunities for the Threshold product suite.\nLead protocol onboarding of Threshold products.\nCoordinate with the Marketing Guild to amplify and promote new integrations.\nManage and maintain ecosystem relationships.\nWrite outbound governance proposals for key tBTC integrations.\nSponsor and support interested protocols to seek partnerships via the forum.\nCollaborate with the Marketing Guild to amplify integration efforts.\nDocumentation and UX\n\nCollect and maintain a list of live tBTC integrations and pools.\nWrite documentation to collate key DAO metadata, integrations and pools.\nSupport DAO UX improvement initiatives, such as tBTC integration’s public dashboard.\nUpdate and maintain tBTC, thUSD and T token registries and lists.\nOversight & Review\nThe Growth Coordinator role will operate under the oversight of the Threshold Treasury Guild (TTG). The position and performance will be reviewed on a quarterly basis by the TTG, upon delivery of a self-evaluation to the committee.\n\nKPIs\nIt was determined that volume-based KPI metrics don’t necessarily align to ideal DAO outcomes. Quality relationships are preferred over a quantity of low-value relationships, and governance cycles differ from protocol to protocol.\n\nTherefore, the performance of this position will be determined based on committee review of a self reported quarterly summary of work achieved, based on the scope listed above.\n\nKey areas of assessment will be:\n\nSuccessful deployment of tBTC liquidity across new chains.\nSuccessful bridging of T token to new chains.\nSuccessful deployment of T incentives to key pools.\nWeekly liquidity and incentives performance reporting to Threshold Treasury Guild.\nProactive, quality, relationship development.\nOngoing relationship and integration management with DAO partners.\nCoordination between DAO guilds and other growth initiatives.\nRecommendation\nWe recommend that Threshold DAO contract with Sap for a 6-month renewable period working 30 hours/week at a rate of $85 USD per hour.\n\nSap will waive their current compensation for the Integrations Guild and Treasury Guild but will maintain their seat on both committees.\n\nWhy Sap\nSap has demonstrated the required motivation, capacity and experience to deliver excellent results in this role, as demonstrated by the development of the L2 liquidity and incentives strategy.\n\nSap actively participates in the Threshold community, operations and governance and is a trusted member of the DAO.\n\nSap has several years’ experience in project management and business development from their time in the industry. Furthermore, Sap’s DeFi expertise lends sufficient technical literacy to communicate clearly with potential partners.\n\nSap has soft skills, such as communication, project management, and creative problem-solving, that allow them to work independently and effectively.\n\nSap is an active contributor to Threshold and has thus far contributed the following to Threshold DAO:\n\nElected member of Threshold Council.\nElected member of Threshold Treasury Guild.\nElected member of Threshold Integrations Guild.\nDelivered FY22 Threshold DAO financial reconciliation and reporting.\nManages current liquidity incentives deployment.\nReports on tBTC liquidity growth.\nCoordinated liquidity strategy between Treasury Guild and ecosystem partners.\nSuccessfully launched tBTC incentives on Balancer and Curve on Optimism and Arbitrum.\nAssisted liquidity deployment and incentivisation of DEXs such as Velodrome, Chronos, KyberSwap and QuickSwap.\nResponsible for Beefy finance integration.\nParticipated in integrations such as Arrakis, Gamma and Harvest.\nThreshold Guardian.",

      "content": "Vote Type:\n\nThreshold Token Holder DAO Snapshot\n\nElected Representatives:\n\nThreshold Marketing Guild (MG) elected committee members.\n\nBrief\n\nThis proposal is a request for $240,000 from the Threshold Token Holder DAO on behalf of the Threshold MG. This is a Q3 2023 budget request but in practice, the governance process for this proposal will not conclude until mid-July and the funds may last beyond September 2023.\n\nThe Threshold Marketing Guild (MG) has demonstrated the ability to manage DAO funds through previous funding requests such as GP-024 which is located on the forum here 1.\n\nThis proposal is the result of collaboration among committee members in planning for upcoming DAO marketing needs.\n\nMilestones and Deadlines:\n\nMG syncs and budget discussion - complete.\nProposal Forum post - 07/13/23.\n5 day Snapshot - Tentatively 7/16, dependent on forum conversation.\nFunds will be managed under the MG multi-sig and will be allocated towards MG goals. This budget will be primarily be used for, but not limited to, the marketing investment categories listed below:\n\nFunding Request:\n\n$100k EthNY\nThis amount will be used to cover sponsorship and bounties for our 2nd major event of the year, as well as contributor travel and lodging expenses.\n\nThe MG has executed conference sponsorships and in-person presence in the past, including ETH Denver and ETH Boston earlier this year.\n\n$100k tBTC-focused Brave campaign\nThe approximate cost for a Brave campaign is $20k per 24 hours of Brave Browser take-over. (Take-over is outlined here 1)\nThe primary goal of the campaign is encouraging users to mint tBTC and promote deposits into liquidity pools, The secondary goal is to target potential new tBTC users for brand awareness and email collection. For this purpose, the Marketing Guild, in collaboration with Keep contributors, is requesting $100k. Initially, we will run a 24-hour campaign test, utilizing no more than $20k, and based on the results we will either continue or discontinue the campaign.\n\n$10k content\nWe request $10k for funding content creation and delivery, including several product videos (tBTC, thUSD, Threshold Access Control).\n\n$30k discretionary / sub proposal fund\nThis includes funding for partnerships/relationships-focused activities, commissioning outsourced marketing expertise (e.g., SEO services) and other opportunities that fall outside the line items listed above. The DAO will be launching both TACo and thUSD in Q3, and we expect to incur costs related to supporting these launches.\n\nIn total, the MG is requesting a budget of $240k USD for use in supporting Guild and DAO marketing and growth efforts throughout Q3/23\n\nExpiry / Timing of Budget Spend:\n\nThere is neither an expiry on the allocated budget nor an estimate of when the funds will be depleted. However, the MG ensures that these funds will be prudently and responsibly allocated toward activities and expenses that are consistent with its focus on strategy, partnerships, and protocol stewardship, and aligned with our goals.\n\nTX Details (if required):\n\nWe request that within 3 days of the approval of this proposal via Snapshot, the Threshold Council queues and executes a transaction for $240,000 USD (denominated in T) to be transferred to the MG multi-sig.\n\nMitigating Slippage:\n\nWe request that in the event that the amount upon receipt by the MG is >4% below the requested budget, a singular “top-off” transaction be created and executed by the Threshold Council to reconcile the deficit.",

The current Marketing Guild Committee agrees on the need to separate the oversight and execution roles, making the former more conducive to the bandwidth most members have, while continuing to improve on the latter by prioritizing, commissioning and compensating contributors based on value and impact, rather than fixed monthly compensation. TIP-49 (Restructure the Marketing Guild Committee) addresses the former plus structure for that latter, while this proposal addresses continuity for the latter.\n\nThe section “FUNCTION 2: Execution on Guild OKRs” in TIP-49 outlines 3 principles that will drive how we go about getting guild work done in the future:\n\nPrioritize & assign work based on expected impact in driving Threshold’s mission\nSource multiple types of contributor to make the MG more productive & resilient\nCompensate contributors based on achieving projects’ results\nThese will require bi-weekly sprint planning plus a retrospective that informs the next sprint plan, soliciting proposals from marketing/communications professionals, developing a process that delivers the best impact/price with the least amount of overhead/administration, developing rubrics to evaluate work output compared to what was commissioned and measure the impact, and larger projects will need retrospectives for improving our process.\n\nThus we need a highly trusted and capable person to manage this process, as well as to execute on the aspects of the MG’s critical core work streams (detailed below) that are most efficiently delivered “in house” and/or can’t wait for another contributor to be sourced, commissioned and evaluated.\n\nIn terms of execution, the scope of this role would cover 4 primary areas, with the primary activities noted below each:\n\nSocial media\n\nLeading and aligning with stakeholders the strategy for putting our assets to best use\nPromoting the Threshold brand, its products and campaigns\nContinuing to engage Threshold in relevant discussions and with influential accounts\nPartnering with the Keep, NuCypher & thUSD teams on tactics\nAligning with Eugene on Wrapped Tour (and subsequent efforts) & posting threads\nAligning with Ryan on Threshold Access Control content & promotion\nContent creation\n\nAligning with Keep, NuCypher & thUSD teams on content & messaging\nDrafting the Threshold Time newsletter content twice per month\nAligning with NuCypher & Keep marketing on blog needs & commissioning writers\nCreating shorter videos & commissioning production of longer ones as needed\nCreating and coordinating content for Community Calls & editing/publishing recordings\nSupporting Threshold documentation updates\nWorking with token tracking sites to update Threshold/product messaging\nSupporting Threshold AMAs\nEvents/campaigns/sponsorships\n\nSupporting stakeholder alignment on Threshold event strategy & budget\nSupporting/coordinating alignment on event messaging & resources\nCoordinating and aligning event strategy & logistics (booth, hackathons, etc.)\nCreating & executing campaigns supporting Threshold’s brand, products & initiatives\nRecommending to MG Committee potential sponsorships\nGuild infrastructure\n\nContinue to enhance alignment and support other guilds on cross-functional projects\nContinuing to add and maintain Threshold’s Notion pages for internal & external use\nSourcing proposals from marketing/communications professionals for outsourced work\nDeveloping and maintaining rubrics for evaluating outsourced work\nSupporting the MG Committee with its quarterly budget requests\nAttending monthly MG Committee meeting & brief committee members on decisions\nResearch & recommend community engagement tools (e.g., Sobol)\nWe recommend that Threshold DAO contract with Ashley (MrsNu) for a 6-month renewable period working 30 hours/week at the $85/hour rate the MG Committee has aligned on and approved for contractor in the past.\n\nAshley is a Threshold “OG” community member (going back to NuCypher), she is a positive and helpful voice everywhere Threshold is being promoted and discussed (Twitter, Discord, Notion, YouTube, emerging Web3 platforms, etc.), and she has proven her value by contributing more to the Marketing Guild’s output over 15 months than anyone else.",

      "title": "TIP 51: Coverage Pool Allocation",
      "content": "TIP 51: Coverage Pool Allocation\n\nVote type:\n\nToken Holder Governor Bravo Temp Check\n\nOverview:\n\nThis is a proposal to provide more insurance to tBTC users in the form of allocating more Threshold DAO resources to the coverage of tBTC. Responsible risk management on behalf of the DAO is critical for tBTC users as the network continues to scale.\n\nCurrently, tBTC is backstopped by a single asset T-only coverage pool. Strong steps toward improving protocol risk management are achieved by the DAO committing more assets to this pool.\n\nThis proposal is an extension of TIP 43- Coverage Pool Migration. The intention is to strike a better initial balance between early tBTC coverage and the opportunity for the DAO to maximize yield by leveraging internal assets elsewhere across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nThe proposal is not the end state for Threshold DAO tBTC risk management. The Threshold DAO can elect to expand tBTC coverage into multiple assets by deploying a new, fully incentivized multi asset coverage pool. This would allow for coverage outside of just T as a single asset which is beneficial for risk management. However, any expansion is out of scope of this proposal.\n\nThe full proposal is available on Threshold forums:\n\nhttps://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-51-coverage-pool-allocation/610",

      "content": "Threshold Marketing Guild Q2 2023 budget request\n\nVote Type: Single choice voting (Yes/No)\n\nDAO-elected Marketing Guild Committee: John Packel, Ashley (@MrsNuBooty), Ryan (@Carusosa), Benjamin (@ZeroInFo56), @nico186, @ben, @Will, @beemeeupnow\n\ntl/dr\n\nThe Marketing Guild Committee requests a budget of $50k for Q2 2023\nAccounting for the previous budget approved for Q3 2022 is provided\nProjected categories for Q2 2023 spend are listed\nContext and links are provided regarding 2 pending Marketing Guild structure proposals\nMilestones and Deadlines:\n\nForum discussion: April 27 - 30\n\nSnapshot vote: May 1 - 5\n\nPrevious budget accounting:\n\nThe Marketing Guild last requested budget in June 2022 for Q3 2022. The request for $124,450 was approved June 19, 2022. While we expected to be able to spend close to that amount, this was based on the intention at that point for both tTBC vs and thUSD to launch sooner. Because it was an approved limit and not a spending mandate, we were able to stretch the funds through Q1 2023, and the current balance remaining is $4,310.\n\nThe intention was to invest in these categories: [see image in Forum post:  https://forum.threshold.network/t/threshold-marketing-guild-q2-2023-budget-request/599 ]\n    \nThe Marketing Guild’s H2 2022 report here details the accomplishments this budget supported, as well as the efforts to iterate on the operating model - an update to which is pending in governance proposals TIP-49 (committee restructure) and TIP-50 (marketing lead contractor).\n\nOur actual outlays were as follows (the discrepancy in totals is owing to token price changes; while we converted most of the T tokens to USDC, we also held some funds in T and ETH):  [see image in Forum post:  https://forum.threshold.network/t/threshold-marketing-guild-q2-2023-budget-request/599 ]\n\nCombining the Education and Design categories, the 11% spent was substantially less than the 21% projected, as we were able to repurpose some content rather than having to commission as much as expected. The Content category came in at 13%, very close to the projected 15%. We found more opportunities for both campaigns and sponsorships, so that 26% essentially matched the projected 27%. Where we invested substantially more than expected (drawing on the 28% discretionary category) was events. The vast majority of this was our major investment in the ETH Denver presence, based on that event’s size and importance in the ETH community (6 years running and approximately 20,000 attendees this year), but we also had a smaller presence at ETH Barcelona, ETH Mexico and Devcon. Spend on administration came in slightly lower than planned (5% vs 8%), in spite of the time we needed to devote to iterating on the committee’s operating model.\n\nQ2 budget request\n\nThe Marketing Guild Committee requests $50k in budget for Q2 (a limit, not a mandate) to support activities in the following categories:\n\nEvents: $15k\nSponsorships: $10k\nCampaigns: $10k\nContent: $10k\nOther: $5k\n\nAs noted above, there are proposals pending to restructure the Marketing Guild Committee and hire a contractor for 30 hours per week as marketing lead. Thus this request should take into account the budget impacts of those proposals (TIP-49 Restructure snapshot ends on April 29th, and TIP-50 Contractor will begin 5-day snapshot a little more than a day after this proposal is posted to the Forum - so this budget can go to snapshot once the outcomes of those are known).\n\nIf TIP-49 Restructure passes, the annual committee compensation will be reduced by $168k to $42k (vs current $210k). If TIP-50 goes to snapshot as proposed and passes, the annual cost of contractor would be $127,500. So if all 3 proposals pass and this $50k Q2 budget request is annualized to $200k, total DAO annual expense for marketing would be projected at $370k.\n\nNote: the Treasury Guild’s Q2 budget request line item of ~$250k in compensation for all guild committee members, the Council and the thUSD team reflects the current Marketing Guild Committee compensation, not the reduced amount proposed (and in terms of process and accounting, the contractor and committee compensation will continue to be budgeted via the Treasury Guild).",

      "title": "TIP 49: Restructure the Marketing Guild Committee",
      "content": "Forum discussion here: https://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-49-restructure-the-marketing-guild-committee/573\n\nVote type:\n\nToken holder DAO Snapshot with a 5-day vote period\n\nDAO-elected representative sponsors:\n\nJohn Packel, Ashley (@MrsNuBooty), Benjamin (@ZeroInFo56), Nico (@nico186), @beemeeupnow\n\ntl/dr:\nBased on 15 months of iterations and lengthy discussion among the Marketing Guild Committee, we propose to separate the guild’s oversight and execution functions, reducing the former to a more manageable scope and outsourcing the latter (i.e., no longer attempting to rely on the committee itself to execute on our OKRs).\n\nOverview:\n\nThreshold’s Marketing Guild has tried a number of approaches over the last 15 months to execute on marketing activities while also providing oversight over funding provided by the DAO (note that the sponsors of this proposal include 3 who have been on the guild’s elected committee since inception).\n\nThe current Marketing Guild Committee (MGC) has concluded that we need to separate the oversight and execution roles, making the former more conducive to the bandwidth most members have, while continuing to improve on the latter by prioritizing, commissioning and compensating contributors based on value and impact, rather than fixed monthly compensation.\n\nThe Proposed solution section under Detailed Summary below details how this will work, while Background provides token holders with context leading to this recommendation.\n\nIn terms of budget impact, these changes would:\n\nreduce our current committee compensation cost from $210,000/year to $42,000/year ($2,500/month x 7, as Ryan has waived compensation since inception)\nrecommend a line item of $127,500 annually for a new 30-hour/week role designed to provide a lot of what Ashley has been contributing without compensation for a year, as well as contributions from the temporary “extra hours” the committee has contracted with John for (~20 hours/week from November - February), which will be discontinued; a separate proposal fleshing out this role will be posted to the Forum shortly\nprovide a net savings of $40,500 annually, assuming the new role is approved and continues for a full 50 weeks (it will be designed to cover most of the work execution Ashley has been providing without compensation beyond her committee pay)\nTimeline:\n\n5 days for comment / discussion on this proposal\ntoken holder DAO Snapshot with a 5-day vote period\nWho Is Involved:\n\nThreshold Marketing Guild, Threshold community and Threshold work token holders\n\nDetailed Summary\n\nBackground\n\nThreshold’s Marketing Guild Committee was founded on March 1, 2022 via ratification of Bootstrap Threshold DAO Guilds, which outlined the structure for all guilds and set compensation for guild committee members at $2,500/mo. for 8 hours/week of contribution on average (also see GP-008 Founding of the Threshold Marketing Guild Committee for detail).\n\nThe design was that, “each guild will have a discretionary budget to fund community proposals and give contributors outside of the committees a chance to participate and earn. This is particularly relevant to the Marketing Guild where the intention from the committee members is to create a proposal process and a job board where community members can take bounties for completing specific marketing-related tasks.”\n\nDuring the first 6 months of 2022 the Marketing Guild accomplished a lot, as detailed in our H1 Retrospective report here, including creating explainer videos, the Threshold Time email newsletter, Marketing Guild Notion sites, and the debut of the One Fern Between Two Keys series. Challenges we noted in the report included, “bandwidth of committee members relative to the ambitious goals… need committee and others to all contribute asynchronously, as well as in team meetings…. Several committee members are spending far more time than anticipated when the compensation was set, and this presents a risk to be addressed.”\n\nIn an effort to address these challenges, and noting that marketing needs would increase substantially in the lead-up to the tBTC v2 launch, in October John made a Forum proposal for a temporary full-time role where he would 1) execute on guild Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), 2) align committee member efforts with those OKRs and those of the Keep and NuCypher contributor teams and 3) support contributors with what they need in order to deliver results. While the Forum comments and conversations about the proposal showed significant support for such a role, there were also concerns over the cost of a full-time role and whether the guild structure could be improved.\n\nThe MGC acted on that feedback by approving funding for up to 22 extra hours/week for John, as well as adopting his recommendation in December to test sprint planning as a way to ensure focus on the highest priorities, provide clarity on each committee members’ tasks, track progress and address roadblocks. (Note: John invoiced an average of 19.8 hours/week through February 12th; hours worked past that date have not yet been approved by the committee.)\n\nWhat the sprint planning and review process in January and February (see here) showed was that Ashley and John were completing the vast majority of the tasks (in addition to planning the sprints, preparing for team meetings to review them and following up with committee members) while other committee members had challenges with bandwidth. This continued in the lead-up to ETH Denver, where we needed to devote several weekly committee meetings almost entirely to event planning and yet there still was not enough contribution to avoid last-minute rushes the week of the event.\n\nOur H2 Retrospective (see here) details significant accomplishments relative to OKRs (which are: 1 - Support the tBTCv2, thUSD, and other launches, 2 - Create content that educates on Threshold’s benefits, 3 - Amplify Threshold community growth, 4 - Develop and maintain Marketing Guild Infrastructure). But it also notes continued challenges: “one committee member resigning for personal reasons, another being asked to leave because they were not contributing or even attending the weekly meeting, several experiencing changes in their day jobs that significantly impacted their available time and flexibility for MG meetings and work streams” and explains that too much of the output continues to depend on John’s temporary extra hours and on Ashley taking on even more uncompensated work than she had previously.\n\nProposed solution\n\nIn the March 22nd MGC meeting John and Ashley cited the December recommendation and subsequent challenges in outlining the need to restructure the committee by separating its oversight and execution functions (see pp. 7-11 in this deck), elaborated on it the following week (see pp. 4-7) and then in the April 3 meeting fleshed out the basis of this proposal (see pp. 1-3).\n\nFUNCTION 1: Allocation & oversight of budget\n\nWhile we considered an alternate approach of potentially dissolving the Marketing Guild Committee and moving the oversight function to the Treasury Guild Committee, this proposal’s sponsors believe that would not be a practical solution and would also violate the founding structural principle of “delegating more granular working group decision making and capital deployment to committee members, allowing the Threshold DAO to operate more effectively in a way that ultimately adds more value to the network”.\n\nAlso, since token holders voted 7 weeks ago to select 4 committee members we believe it’s best to retain the current committee in a scaled down oversight function that fits the bandwidth most members have (expectation being ~6 hours/month), while also including accountability enforcement. We propose the following structure:\n\nDecision scope\n1. Voting on quarterly Marketing Guild budget request, plus allocations greater than $10k - as signers on the multi-sig\n2. Expected number of votes per month: 1 - 3\n\nCadence\n1. One 2-hour meeting per month, with actionable agenda aligned 3 days prior\n2. One week in advance, Chair provides background material for discussion topics\n\nMeeting format\n1. Q&A on decision/discussion topics, meeting materials\n2. Hold vote & record; Coordination role will action any topic not able to be voted on\n3. Align on next steps\n\nAccountability\n1. Each person’s ongoing committee membership is contingent on them participating fully\n2. Secretary records attendance, votes & minutes in Notion within 24 hours of meeting; Chair confirms committee member participation monthly\n3. Adopt a “commitments” document modeled on the MG Committee’s current one - required meeting attendance, input, votes, etc.\n4. Each member performs a role on the committee, contributing to one of these 4 functions: Chair, Secretary, Coordination, Accounting\n\nCompensation: reduced to $500/mo. from current $2,500/mo.\n\nFUNCTION 2: Execution on Guild OKRs\n\nRather than task the same group of people to both provide Threshold DAO with oversight over budget as well as execute on the guild’s OKRs, we propose an approach that borrows from Gnosis Safe DAO’s “Outcomes Based Resource Allocation” (thanks to Jake Lynch for sharing).\n\nThese principles will drive how we go about getting guild work done:\n\nPrioritize & assign work based on expected impact in driving Threshold’s mission\n\nWe are here to make an impact and are accountable to token holders and our DAO colleagues, so all activities need to support OKRs and have clear benefits or measurable outcomes. We will resume sprint planning, but on a bi-weekly cadence and ending each sprint with a retrospective that informs the next sprint plan.\n\nSource multiple types of contributor to make the MG more productive & resilient\n\nExisting committee members who are willing and able to commit to projects with clear outcomes and accountability are encouraged to make project proposals. We will also solicit proposals from marketing/communications professionals - and develop a process that delivers the best impact/price with the least amount of overhead/administration.\n\nCompensate contributors based on achieving projects’ results\n\nWe will develop rubrics/scorecards that evaluate work output compared to what was commissioned and measure the impact wherever possible. Larger projects will have retrospectives for improving our process.\n\nIn order to achieve the above we need a highly trusted and capable person to manage this process, as well as to execute on the aspects of the MG’s critical core work streams (Social media, Content creation and Event marketing) that are most efficiently delivered “in house” and/or can’t wait for another contributor to be sourced, commissioned and evaluated.\n\nTo that end, several of the sponsors will post a separate proposal to the Forum in the next few days recommending that Threshold DAO contract with Ashley (MrsNu) for a 6-month renewable period working 30 hours/week. Ashley is a Threshold “OG” community member (going back to NuCypher), she is a positive and helpful voice everywhere Threshold is being promoted and discussed (Twitter, Discord, Notion, YouTube, emerging Web3 platforms, etc.), and she has proven her value by contributing more to the Marketing Guild’s output over 15 months than anyone else.\n\nThank you to @ben, @Carusosa, @sap, @derek, @Eastban, @Vict0r and Will for providing helpful feedback on our draft proposal, as well as Luna for ongoing support for all guilds.",

      "title": "TIP-047 Temp-Check: Liquidity Bootstrappening and Growth Part 2 - PCV",
      "content": "Overview:\n\nThis is a multi-phased proposal intended to deploy a DAO-owned strategic plan to deepen tBTC liquidity and develop essential Threshold BTC-based Protocol Owned Liquidity.\n\nIt builds a DeFi revenue flywheel owned by the Threshold DAO and managed by the Threshold Treasury Guild (TTG) through four phases. This proposal was originally authored by Matt.\n\nImportant Note:\n\nThis version of TIP 47 is the result of multiple working sessions and iterations with the TTG. The Threshold DAO onchain proposal flow process requires a successful temp check snapshot before queing into Governor Bravo. The governance plan is to conduct the Threshold DAO temperature check to gauge the spirit of this proposal while the TTG conducts the final diligence and parameter determination required to execute the proposal.\n\nIf the temp check passes, this proposal will be amended to include final details before moving onto Governor Bravo vote if it successfully passes the temp check stage. To improve readability any such detail will be identified by a :pencil2:.\n\nMilestones and Deadlines:\n\nThreshold DAO Temperature Check\n04/07/23\nAmended proposal submitted to Threshold DAO\nWeek of 04/10/23\nGovernor Bravo proposal kick off\nWeek of 04/07/23\nDates for each bond phase are intentionally left open to provide execution flexibility for the TTG.\nWho Is Involved?:\n\nThreshold Token Holder DAO, Threshold Treasury Guild\n\nDetailed Summary:\n\nPhase I\n\nThe first phase is a test of the bonding mechanism, and our ability to get the word out.\n\nWe do a public campaign to retire v1, in coordination with Curve and maybe Convex: and offer all LPs a deal to sell their position for T. Initially we use Bond Protocol, the latest iteration of Olympus Pro, to avoid writing our own smart contracts.\n\n:pencil2:Bond details:\n\nBonds are for T\nBonds are bought for Curve tBTC v1 LP tokens\nPhase II\n\nIn the second phase, the DAO goes hard, converting as much Curve BTC LP tokens as quickly as it can to Curve tBTC v2. The focus should be on “dead” pools with little trading volume, whose LPs are likely open to switching pools (lazy mercenaries).\n\nIn this phase, LPs are offered both Curve tBTC v2 LP tokens and T for their other LP tokens… Because T isn’t used primarily to reward LPs, there’s less pressure than in Phase I — instead, the DAO is spending down its diversified treasury for growth, periodically unwrapping the BTC variants it receives.\n\nWe can do a public campaign around “Retiring renBTC”, ideally in coordination with Curve and Badger. “Have renBTC LP tokens? The Threshold DAO will buy them off you!”.\n\n:pencil2:Bond details:\n\nT\n\nBonds are bought for\nCurve wibBTC\nCurve renBTC\nCurve sBTC\nCurve tBTC v2\n\nBonds are bought for\nCurve wibBTC\nCurve renBTC\nCurve sBTC\nPhase III\n\nAt this point, the DAO will have a large Curve tBTC v2 position. The DAO will incentivize votes on the Curve tBTC v2 gauge, further strengthening growth and brining more immediate value back to the DAO. The TTG will have discretion in determining the incentive schedule based on a budget proposed later in this document.\n\nThis is a great time for a Yearn Curve tBTC v2 factory vault.\n\nPhase IV\n\nIn the final and optional phase, we deploy an ongoing bonding strategy. This exact venue for these bonds is out of scope of this proposal and will be discussed later.\n\n:pencil2:Bond details:\n\nThe bond is for T. If possible, new stakers should be able to skip any vesting period\nenabling a constant discount on T.\nBonds are bought for\nCurve HBTC\nMake sure we have a way to unmint HBTC consistently\nLow discount, this is about getting people to switch.\nCurve tBTC v2\nThis is our ongoing long-term PCV incentive\nCost and other parameters\n\nWithout testing the market, it’s difficult to know the cost of liquidity over time, or how sticky the liquidity will be. Thus , this proposal sets aside a high-level budget, managed and reported on monthly by the Treasury Guild.\n\n:pencil2: 10M T for use on vote incentives via platforms like Votium\n:pencil2: 40M T for directly purchasing BTC-denominated PCV\nThe TG can then start low, and increase or decrease investment where appropriate.",

      "content": "Author: IG/East\nPosted by: ZeroInFo56\n\nProposal\nThe Integrations Guild proposes that the number of Integrations Guild committee seats be changed from 5 to 7.\n\nBackground\n\n(From @Eastban discord post)\n\n\"Dear all,\n\nAs you can see in the forum post we’re having a lot of really interesting nominations for our Integrations Guild. I personally know them almost all and would be delighted to work with everyone on the IG.\n\nIn that regard we’ve been discussing in the IG committee expanding the seats on our guild.\n\nIG is absorbing a lot of stuff outside its initial scope of protocol integrations.\nWe’ve been tackling with diverse subjects that otherwise fall through the cracks in the DAO, such as e.g.:\n\nbug bounty program and relationship with Immunify\nSubgraph development and grant management\nTokenlists\nDiscourse implementation\nMonitoring for nodes\nTech support for the DAO\nGuests for community calls\nWe have great skills to cover these. Irl tech jobs & experience of various of our actual IG committee members makes it comfortable thinking about these wider scopes, but we’re running out of availability and we’re feeling short at hands. We could use more BD oriented people in the IG.\nMore so during this particular phase in our DAO’s life after the long awaited tBTC launch to actively reach out to protocols, establish longterm prosperous relationships with other apps and successfully integrate tBTC expanding its use cases.\n\nI therefore want to ask to increase by 2 our current seats (5) to (7).\"\n\nThis proposal would increase the number of signatories on the Threshold multisig from 5 to 7 and increase the threshold required to sign as well from 3 to 4.\n\nTimeline\nFeb 24 to Feb 27 - Discussion Period\nFeb 27 to Mar 1 - Snapshot Voting Period (contingent on above)\nMar 1 - Implement Changes (contingent on above)",

      "title": "Integrations Guild Budget",
      "content": "Executive Summary\nThe IG multi-sig still holds ~393k T = ~$7100 from our previous budget. In our previous budget request, we stated:\n\n“Further, we request that in the event that the amount upon receipt by the IG is >4% below the requested budget, that a singular “top-off” transaction be created and executed by the TG to reconcile the deficit.”\n\nAt the time of receipt by the IG, the tokens transferred were worth ~$34,945, ($4,555 below the requested amount). Therefore, as part of this budget, we request that the remaining $4,555 be transferred to the IG. In addition, the IG is requesting discretionary funding of $65,945 (for a total of $70,500) from the Threshold Treasury for the remainder of Q4 2022 and Q1 2023.\n\nNew holdings would equal approximately ~$77,500. This discretionary budget will be primarily used for:\n\nThreshold Support Moderator\nPurchase of GRT\nDAO2DAO/protocol integration efforts\nCompensation for IG non-committee contributors\nDaily operational and DAO tooling efforts (i.e. Notion website)\nTech support and mod group activities\nReimbursement to committee members for gas fees related to executing multi-sig transactions and other operational activities\nOther USD-denominated expenses and reimbursements\nIntegrations Guild Goals / Missions\nThe goal of the Integrations Guild is to support the launch of Thresholds’ flagship products and the integration of these products on various L1 and L2 protocols within DeFi:\n\ntBTC v2\nProxy Re-Encryption (“PRE”)\nCommunity-led thUSD project\nAs a newly formed protocol, Threshold will benefit from collaboration and partnerships with various DAOs and protocols.\n\nThreshold Support ModeratorOn 7/26/22 @vict0r was appointed by the Integrations Guild as the Threshold Support Moderator - This position incurs a monthly cost of $6500 to the IG.\nSoliciting Integrations and use-cases for all Threshold Products.\nNotion - This is an ongoing expenditure for the DAO, we expect that as the DAO grows, this cost will also grow.\nUse of Proceeds\nFunds will be managed under the IG multi-sig and will be allocated towards the IG goals listed above as well as any discretionary incentives from partnerships/relationships focused activities that may fall outside of the initial IG scope. The funds will primarily be used for, but not limited to, the causes listed below:\n\nThreshold Support Moderator\nThis position incurs a monthly cost of $6500 to the IG. This budget period will cover 4 payments totaling $26,000\nSoliciting Integrations and use-cases for all Threshold Products.\nWe request a total of $7000 for Q4 ‘22 & Q1 ‘23 be dedicated to this end.\nDAO Tooling/Notion\nWe request a total of $3500 for the quarter to be used for DAO tooling such as Notion, Sparkwave, etc as well as cover the cost for any additional Notion “licenses” as needed.\nSub-graph\nAs is listed in the IG OKR’s, we intend to solicit and fund the development of a Sub-graph + Front End portal to track deposits, withdrawals and operators. Similar to allthekeeps.com for tBTC v1. The development cost for this is expected to total $10,500\nPurchase of 10,000-15,000 GRT ($700-$1100)\nThe price of T has fallen by ~39% since the receipt of our last budget - therefore, the IG intends to swap a to-be-determined portion of our new budget into stablecoins so that we will have the freedom to continue our mission without concern for financial obstacles or hurdles.\n\nThis list is non-exhaustive, we feel that it is quite likely that over the duration of this quarter, we will incur additional expenses, and/or be subject to opportunities that may require additional funding. For this reason, we request a total budget of $77,500 for the duration of Q4 ‘22 and Q1 ‘23.\n\nExpiry / Timing of Budget Spend\nThere is neither an expiry on the allocated budget nor an estimate of when the funds will be depleted. However, the IG ensures that these funds will be prudently and responsibly allocated toward activities and expenses that are consistent with its focus on strategy, partnerships, and protocol stewardship, and aligned with our OKR’s.\n\nFunding\nWe request that no less than 5 days from approval of this budget, the Treasury Guild execute on the transfer of $65,945 USD paid in T to the IG Multi-sig. Further, we request that in the event that the amount upon receipt by the IG is >4% below the requested budget, that a singular “top-off” transaction be created and executed by the TG to reconcile the deficit.",

The sum distributed, and therefore withdrawable, will depend on the average staking rate between October 1st and January 1st (if it were to remain static, then approximately half of the 250m will be distributed). Every stake associated with a functioning PRE and tBTCv2 node will grow by 15% APY (~3.82% over 93 days is the target yield in this epoch). For the reward split schedule (between the two applications), see <TIP-032>.\n\nMinting sum calculation\nFor more details on the minting methodology and token distribution procedure, please see <TIP-030>.\n\nThis minting event will seek to cover the period of October 1st 2022 until January 1st 2023. This is equivalent to 93 full days of staking.\nThe target stake growth in this time is: (15% / 365) * 93 = 3.82%.\nBased on the total T claimed up until today, the liquid circulating supply is 10.141bn T. There is 3.12bn staked, which implies a current staking rate of 30.76%. This means the sum of tokens required to universally increase all stakes by 3.82% is: (3.82% * 10.141bn) * 30.76% = 119.2m T\nThe ‘ceiling’ staking rate is computed to be 63.32% – three standard deviations of the daily historical staking rate (mean) since network launch, added to today’s staking rate. This approximately covers the 99.7% percentile of future staking rate scenarios, assuming a simplified normal distribution. It is reasonable to assume that the launch of tBTCv2 could be as impactful on the incentive to operate a node as the launch of the network in April, hence the variance calculation above includes data entries starting from network genesis.\nApplying the same calculation in (3) but inputting the ceiling staking rate instead of today’s staking rate, the sum of tokens required to deliver 15% annual yield to all eligible stakes (until January 2023) would be 245.44m T.\nRounding up, this proposal therefore suggests that the Threshold DAO mint 250m T tokens. Note that about 49% are likely to be distributed, unless the staking rate grows far quicker than it has in recent months. The excess tokens will be withheld by the Council and are not made liquid or withdrawable, but may be used for future rewards later in 2023.",

The funds will primarily be used for, but not limited to, the causes listed below:\n\nThreshold Support Moderator\nThis position incurs a monthly cost of $6500 to the IG.\nSoliciting Integrations and use-cases for all Threshold Products.\nWe request a total of $6000 for Q3 to be dedicated to this end.\nNotion\nWe request a total of $800 for the quarter to be expended in the case of an increased need for Notion “licenses”\nThis list is non-exhaustive, we feel that it is quite likely that over the duration of this quarter, we will incur additional expenses, and/or be subject to opportunities that may require additional funding. For this reason, we request a total budget of $46,650 for the quarter.\n\nExpiry / Timing of Initial Funding Spend\nThere will be neither an expiry on the allocation spend nor an estimate of when the funds will be spent, but the IG ensures that these funds will be prudently and responsibly allocated towards activities that are consistent with its focus on strategy, partnerships, and protocol stewardship.\n\nFunding\nWe request that no less than 5 days from approval of this budget, the Treasury Guild execute on the transfer of $39,500 USD paid in T to the IG Multisig.\nFurther, we request that in the event that the amount upon receipt by the IG is >4% below the initially requested budget, a singular “top-off” transaction be created and executed by the TG to reconcile the deficit.",

      "title": " TIP 30: Rules for Guild Committee Elections and Management",
      "content": "## Overview\n\nThe Rules Committee proposes to establish the following standing rules for guild committee elections and management. These rules act as the default standing rules for guild committees and will be applied to the existing Marketing, Integrations, and Treasury guilds. If a guild wants to modify these rules they shall include the modifications in a proposal and have it approved by a DAO vote. Any newly formed guilds will use these rules as a default unless they specify different rules in the proposal that forms the guild. These rules to not cover potential compensation of committee members, which are handled through budgetary proposals.\n\n## Guild Committee Standing Rules\n\n### Guild Committees Seats\nGuild committee seats are filled by a Snapshot vote of the DAO.\n\n### Nominations\nAny DAO member can be nominated for an upcoming guild committee seat, including self-nominations. A person who is nominated by another member must confirm their intent to be a candidate. A nomination forum post will be created for each guild ten days prior to the start of elections; nominations are made by replying to the forum post announcing the upcoming election for that particular guild.\n\n### Elections\nElections for all committees shall begin 30 days prior to the start of the next committee term. All nominations will be put up for a seven day token-weighted vote on Snapshot. Open seats are filled in the order of votes received. In the event that not all seats are filled by the voting process, there will be an additional election to fill the remaining seats. In the case of a tie, there shall be a run-off vote.\n\n### Committee Chairperson and Secretary\nEach committee should assign a chairperson and secretary. Chairs do not have additional power; it is recommended that they only vote on issues in cases where their vote is decisive; their principal role is to expedite business and serve as a point of contact for other guilds. The secretary is responsible for maintaining minutes of any formal proceedings and a preferred contact method for each committee member and to give notice to committee members whenever formal notification is required. Chairperson and secretary are to be decided by a committee vote in the first two weeks of a new term. A redundancy for each position is recommended\n\n### Term\nCommittee terms shall be for 12 months staggered in two groups starting March 1st and September 1st. For the first election, half of seats (rounded up if even) will sit for the full 12-month term; half of the seats (rounded down if even) will receive a 6 month term in order to set up for staggered elections. The full-term seats will be filled first based on the greatest number of votes received. Committees should prioritize creating a budget for the upcoming quarter as their order of business. Existing committee members will work with any new committee members during the two weeks prior to the new term for an effective transition.\n\n### Vote of No Confidence\nAs committee terms are staggered, with elections every six months, the DAO may, by majority vote, pass a vote of no confidence in a guild committee. In the event of a successful vote of no confidence (concluded at most 60 days and at least 30 days prior to an election) all the committee seats of the specified guild would be up for election during the upcoming election\n\n### Quorum\nThe default quorum for committee decision making is defined as greater than 50% of the number of committee seats, i.e. for a committee of six, a quorum would be four.\n\n### Termination of a Committee Member\nTermination of a committee member would require either a DAO Snapshot vote with a minimum of 2/3 of votes in the affirmative to remove the member; or a 2/3 vote from the committee itself with one week’s notice to committee members and the governance channel prior to the vote.\n\n### Committee Vacancy\nIn the case of a resignation or termination, the committee will nominate and vote on a replacement for the remainder of the vacant term.\n\n### Term Limits and Restrictions\nThere are no term limits or restrictions on the number of committees that a person may serve on.\n\n### Number of Committee Seats\nThe number of seats on a given committee is set at the time the committee is formed by a DAO proposal. Any change to the number of committee seats requires a DAO Snapshot vote.\n\n### Reporting\nThe committee secretary will maintain public minutes of guild committee decisions. The chairperson (or their assignee) will attend each inter-guild call.\n\n### Creation of New Guilds\nNew guilds may be formed by the adoption of a proposal to the DAO. Guilds will abide by the above rules unless specified at the time of guild creation or modification by a DAO snapshot proposal.",

      "content": "Overview:\n\nTwo seperate proposals have been put forward with regard to the maintenance of the Relayer costs. \n-----------------------------\nBoth Proposals State:\n\"This is a proposal to request that the Threshold DAO funds the full costs of the relay maintainer in T for a timeboxed period of 5 months starting with June.\"\n\nThe two proposals differ in who is responsible for maintaining the costs and how the DAO pays for it (T or ETH).\n-----------------------------\nTIP-28 States:\n\"The Keep team will continue to monitor and top up the relay maintainer with ETH. The Threshold DAO will fund the full cost of the relay maintainer on a timebox of 5 months starting with June. This will be in the form of T transfers to a Keep wallet at the end of each month. The total T will be determined by the amount of ETH used to keep the relay maintainer going for that month.\n\nETH is a more scarce resource for the DAO and the Threshold Treasury Guild does not want all of its upcoming treasury diversification efforts to go towards relay maintainer expenses which is why this proposal includes T.\"\n\nMore Information: https://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-28-threshold-dao-funding-for-the-relay-maintainer/363\n-----------------------------\nTIP-29 States:\n\"This proposal directly involves Keep, the Threshold Treasury Guild and the Threshold Council.\n\nFurthermore, this proposal nominates Ben (ZeroInFo56) to take lead on monitoring ETH funds in the relay maintainer and keeping the Treasury Guild up to date with said information.\"\n\n\"Community discussion on this topic leading up to this proposal occured in the #governance channel on Discord, at multiple DAO meetings and on the first TIP-28 proposal on the forum.\n\nStarting with the month of July the Threshold DAO will take ownership of the relay maintainer for a timeboxed period of 5 months. Specifically, the Threshold Treasury Guild will be responsible for executing top ups on the maintainer in ETH. In the past, the maintainer has been topped up on a 2 week cadence. However, the Threshold Treasury Guild can determine its own top up cadence.\"\n\nMore Information: https://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-29-threshold-dao-funding-for-the-relay-maintainer-v2/367",

This request includes $89,450 in budget line-item funds and $35,000 in discretionary funds. The budget is a spend approval - not a spend mandate.\n\n### Milestones and Deadlines:\n\nBudgeted funds are for Q3 2022. A budget proposal for Q4 for will be submitted by September 1, 2022.\n\n### Proposed schedule:\n\nForum Discussion Started: June 9, 2022\nForum Discussion Concluded: June 12, 2022\nSnapshot Vote Started: June 13, 2022\nSnapshot Vote Concluded: June 15, 2022\nOn-chain Voting Begins: June 17, 2022\nOn-chain Voting Concluded: June 27, 2022\n\n### Who is Involved:\n\nThe Threshold Marketing Guild Committee (MGC) multisig consists of @MrsNuBooty , @nous , @ZeroInFo56 , @Weedzy , @Jessi , @Liz_S, @Carusosa and @JohnPackel.\n\n### Why:\n\nThis quarterly budget is to support the mission of the Marketing Guild Committee to support Threshold development teams’ marketing efforts, grow our network of contributors to Threshold DAO, onboard new members, educate on Threshold’s value, services and use cases and more.\n\n### Supporting Details:\n\nA line-item summary of the budget is linked below and further supported by the budget presentation slides (which were presented and discussed on a weekly Marketing Guild open “T Party” meeting on June 2, 2022).\n\nAlso included is a summary of Q2 transactions from the initial founding discretionary budget. Approximately 2/3 of that initial T has been spent so far in Q2, but unfortunately the majority of the dollar value was lost due to market value decline.\n\nA link is also provided to the Marketing Guild’s Q3 Objectives and Key Results, which includes these goals: support an increase in Threshold stakers, build education around the platform, amplify community growth, and create the Marketing Guild’s infrastructure.\n\n### Transaction Details:\n\nTransfer $124,450 USD value of T at the time of the transaction to the Marketing Guild Committee multi-signature wallet.\n\n### Links:\n\n[Proposed Budget Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZlzrqaDMoV5V65Iu8HkVD49Y-nZtjDbFqSduUzTv6sM/edit#gid=0)\n[Marketing Guild Q3 Budget Request Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CzistsV4LX9w5flKarm0KcK315e7twuPHejthx3lXqw/edit#slide=id.g11993dbf6de_0_45)\n[Q2 Marketing Guild Spend Transactions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yz80gTHDZeqBEhMElmSH4lUeV2cLyMCfqbmZd3eR3mA/edit?pli=1#gid=0)\n[Q3 Marketing Guild Objectives & Key Results (OKRs)](https://thresholdnetwork.notion.site/Marketing-Guild-OKRs-6272ac3b4bc34200b42ba08f273d2cdd)\n",

      "title": "Threshold Improvement Proposals (TIPs): Flows and Template",
      "content": "### Intro:\n\nThis proposal standardizes the TIP flow and TIP template to provide more structure to the growing Threshold governance process ahead of our first Governor Bravo (GB) vote. The flow is a detailed extension of the one previous validated in the Threshold DAO v2 proposal. No GB parameters have been changed.\n\nThreshold’s governance system is polycentric. With the introduction of GB there are a few categories of likely future Threshold proposals:\n\n- DAO-wide proposals that require and trigger immediate onchain action\n- DAO-wide proposals that do not require and do not trigger immediate onchain action\n- SubDAO specific proposals. SubDAO refers to individual Threshold Guilds, Threshold Council\n\nThis proposal was reviewed by @dougvk, @Nous, @Derek, @jakelynch and Chris before publishing.\n\n### DAO-wide proposals that require and trigger immediate onchain action:\n\nThese are votes that directly impact the protocol and require immediate onchain actions such as adjustments to tBTC v2 governable parameters.\n\nThis process applies to both the Token Holder DAO and the Staker DAO.\n\n*Step One — Forum Post*\n\n- Anyone can post a potential proposal\n- Must have sponsor from an elected DAO representative such as a council member or guild committee member (reduces spam)\n- Post lives on forum for 3 days to be discussed and debated by the DAO. During this time edits and adjustments can be made to the proposal based on feedback.\n\n*Step Two - Temperature Check*\n\n- Proposal is moved to snapshot\n- Edits can no longer be made to the proposal\n- Proposal must receive >50% support on the snapshot\n- 25M T quorum on snapshot\n- Temp check snapshot is 3 days\n\n*Step Three - Proposal Creation*\n\n- Community member meeting proposal threshold vote weight creates onchain proposal\n- Two day delay before voting begins\n\n*Step Four - Vote Period*\n\n- Onchain Proposal voting remains open for 10 days\n\n*Step Five - Execution*\n\n- Proposals that pass according to criteria of our validated gb dynamics move onto execution phase (2 day time delay)\n- Proposal that don’t pass are automatically canceled\n\n### DAO-wide proposals that do not require immediate onchain action:\n\nGB is fantastic but it is not the best (or most cost effective) way to query the DAO for decision making in every instance. Proposals that do not require immediate onchain action will still leverage snapshot for more efficient off chain voting.\n\n*Step One - Forum Post*\n\n- Anyone can post a potential proposal\n- Must have sponsor from an elected DAO representative such as a council member or guild committee member (reduces spam)\n- Post lives on forum for 3 days to be discussed and debated by the DAO. During this time edits and adjustments can be made to the proposal based on feedback.\n\n*Step Two - Vote*\n\n- Proposal is moved to snapshot\n- Edits no longer can be made to proposal\n- 5 day vote window\n- 1.5% quorum\n\n*Step Three - Execution*\n\n- Two day time delay after the proposal passes before it is considered fully validated\n- Council can veto the result of the proposal during time delay\n- If it is not vetoed during this period the proposal is considered validated and off chain action can be taken\n\n### Threshold SubDAO Specific Proposals:\n\nThreshold SubDAO votes will continue to be handled on a per group basis. For example, the Threshold Marketing Guild currently has a separate thread on the forum for to be considered proposals and the Threshold Treasury guild can continue to internally vote on ecosystem liquidity incentives.\n\n### Threshold Improvement Proposal Template:\n\nThis template is the suggested format to follow for TIPs but is not absolutely required in every case.\n\nTIP Number and Title:\n\nVote Type:\n\nDAO Elected Representative Sponsor:\n\nOverview:\n\nMilestones and Deadlines:\n\nWho is Involved:\n\nWhy:\n\nDetailed Summary:\n\nTx Details (If required):\n\nAdditional Info (Optional):\n\nIf the TIP involves a major product change or feature addition the following categories should be added:\n\nScope:\n- Must Have:\n- Nice to Have:\n- Not in Scope:",

      "title": "Proposal: Application for DAO Project Manager",
      "content": "### Objective\n\nThis proposal is for the Threshold Network DAO to fund the Threshold project manager (PM).\n\n[I](https://forum.threshold.network/u/Luna5) am submitting this proposal after having been invited to attend several DAO meetings, and a meeting sync between the teams. My observations of the current needs from the DAO come from the audits of these meetings plus the insights I obtained by reading the public discord channels and the Threshold Notion.\n\n### Environment\n\nThis PM role will be developed in the Threshold DAO environment, where there is a strong need for fluent and smooth collaborations and communications between the following entities:\n\n- The DAO community.\n- The Threshold Guilds: Integrations Guild, Marketing Guild, Treasury Guild.\n- The Keep team.\n- The NuCypher team.\n- The thUSD team.\n\n### Scope\n\nThe role of the PM in this environment would be shaped as a facilitator, where the main pillars in which it would be founded are: visibility and communication.\n\nThrough visibility, understanding and acknowledgement are achieved. It is necessary to provide an up-to-date single source of truth for the teams and the Guilds, to communicate their lines of work, their resources, their successes and lessons learned. This central knowledge source should be available to consult from any member of the community.\n\nCommunication processes are needed to keep the community informed about the different initiatives, their progress and successes. Also, mechanisms should be put in place to receive inputs and requests from the community, where new ideas can be included in the line of work, enriching the community (and avoiding losing these insights in the background of the discord channels).\n\nIt is through communication that effective management is achieved. Keeping track of the different teams’ work in progress will help unblock the problems and interdependencies arising, and mitigate their impact on the different initiatives within Threshold. A document scoping the competencies for the Threshold PM is provided [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rBiSLMLX7ATanP603g_R0zz8-h7xIBfYF2AdGM6_zEw/edit).\n\nIt’s important to note that the Threshold PM position does not hold a higher hierarchy over any team, being independent from them and reporting this way only to the DAO. As a facilitator role, its focus is to introduce visibility and communication processes. Teams and guilds will continue to be independent and self-sovereign.\n\n### My background\n\nI currently work as a Technical Program Manager at a SW development company in the web2 environment, where I’m doing a founding PM job bringing processes and standards to the company’s DevOps department (currently composed of 3 sub-departments, having 3 squads of engineers each) in order to align their ways of work with the company-wide processes. Here I find the usual clashes of agile although very procedural groups (working in sprints and following structured processes), with non-procedural working efforts guided by a kanban-style methodology. A situation similar to the one occurring within the Threshold community.\n\nRegarding my studies, I have a Bs and a Ms in Computer Science with major focuses on SW Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and Project Management. I developed my master thesis in Project Management, focused on the study of agile methodologies, analyzing the most popular ones applied to the IT world, procedures and useful guides and tools to manage them. Later on, I got a Google certification as Project Manager.\n\nI also have a PhD in cyber security, focused on the protection of the information in Critical Infrastructures. Here, my thesis was oriented from the perspective of Business Analysis, where I studied the main characteristics and needs of complex interconnected legacy systems, in need of preemptive security mechanisms such as Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems and the possible security AI-driven actuators. As part of my work in research, I have participated in many national and international projects that involved coordinating efforts from both academic institutions and different industries.\n\nAdditionally, I have a deep domain knowledge about the different initiatives being developed in Threshold, and I am especially acquainted with the PRE project and the NuCypher team, since I have a personal relationship with @davidnunez. This allowed me to follow the project since its inception and gain deep knowledge on this particular space. This will reduce the job’s entry barrier and the regular onboarding time period.\n\n### Cost\n\nThis proposal is for a Project Manager position in the Threshold community. The overall conditions are very similar to the thUSD proposals to the DAO.\n\n- Rate $500 USD per day paid in T, USDC and/or ETH.\n- The T token and ETH price taken as the global average price as recorded on coingecko for the day that the work was completed.\n- This rate is consistent with the Project Manager allocation in the current budget proposal.\n- Hours reviewed and approved fortnightly.\n- Tokens transferred monthly.\n\n### FAQ\n\nQ: Would you consider reducing the budget?\n\nA: A budget reduction would be difficult, however, I would consider starting with a reduced number of hours allocated to the job, and setting a process for progressively increasing the weekly number of hours.\n\nQ: When can you start?\n\nA: When a vote passes and a review team is selected and approved, I can start contributing part-time. After July 15th, I can start to work full-time.\n\nQ: How many days a week can you commit?\n\nA: 5\n\nQ: Will your personal relationship to @davidnunez from the NuCypher team impact your ability to work together?\n\nA: I don’t think this will be an issue, since the PM work will serve as facilitator among the different teams and groups present in the Threshold community. NuCypher team is just one of the actors present and this position holds no higher hierarchy over any team or guild, being independent from them and reporting only to the DAO. The main tasks needing interfacing with the teams would be roadmap check-ins, status check-ins and communications provided to the teams for visibility (executive summaries, updates and synchronizations).",

      "title": "Interim Era Incentive Schemes: (1) One-off Migration+Stake Bonus & (2) Ongoing Stable Yield",
      "content": "### 1) Bonus Deadline Extension to June 1st \n\n~1.89 billion T has been staked and over 90 PRE nodes are up and running! A great start, but newer stakers could use a little more time – so we suggest extending the deadline of the Migration & Stake Bonus, such that any staker who commences staking before June 1st will be eligible. The bonus, if validated by the snapshot & DAO vote, will now be 3% for eligible stakers – see qualifying criteria below. Time-based rewards (15% target APY) will start accruing to your stake from June 1st onwards. The first merkle distribution – after which your rewards will be withdrawable – is planned for mid-July. The updated bonus eligibility criteria: \n\n- Begin staking and correctly configure their Proxy Re-Encryption operator node prior to June 1st (previously May 15th) . \n- Reliably operate a PRE operator node until at least July 15th, and ideally through the launch of Threshold’s full applications. Temporary outages in PRE node operation due to known infrastructure failures (e.g. due to DigitalOcean or Infura downtime) will not automatically forfeit affected stakers’ bonuses. However, please take care to avoid extended non-availability. \n- Remain fully staked until mid-July. If you unbond any part of your stake between June 1st and the first distribution (mid-July), you will automatically forfeit the entire bonus – all 3%. However, you would still accrue ongoing (time-based) rewards in proportion to your stake size and the duration that it remains staked. \n\nThe requirement to set a delegatee address has been removed from the original criteria in the forum proposal. However, it is still required to participate in the Threshold DAO.\n\n### 2) Ongoing Stable Yield\n\nFrom June 1st onwards, reward amounts will be based on the duration you are staked and reliably operating a PRE node. The target annual yield will be 15%. For example, a staker who starts staking on June 15th would see their stake grow by (15/365 * 15% = 0.62%) in the 15 days up until June 30th. The nominal inflation rate and monthly issuance figure will again be dependent on the average staking rate.\n\n**Note: The token holder DAO will vote through governor bravo to actually mint rewards in the follow weeks**\n",

      "content": "# **Executive Summary**\n\nThe Threshold Integrations Guild (“IG”) is requesting initial discretionary funding of USD$40,000 (“Initial Funding”) from the Threshold Treasury.\n\nSpecifically, IG committee members are requesting an **Initial Funding of 306,371 $T tokens**, **based on TWAP $T price of $0.1306 as of 4/19/22 (via [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/threshold/historical-data/)),** that will be primarily used for:\n\n- DAO2DAO/protocol integration efforts\n- Compensation for IG non committee contributors\n- Daily operational and DAO tooling efforts (i.e. Notion website)\n- Miscellaneous tech support and mod group activities\n- Reimbursement to council members for gas fees related to executing multi-sigs and other operational activities\n- Other USD denominated expense reimbursement\n\n# **Integrations Guild Goals / Missions**\n\nThe goal of the Integrations Guild is to finalize and launch Thresholds’ flagship products as well as the integration of these products on various L1 and L2 protocols within DeFi:\n\n- tBTC v2\n- Proxy Re-Encryption (“PRE”)\n- Community-led thUSD stablecoin\n\nAs a newly formed protocol, Threshold will benefit from collaboration and partnerships with various DAOs and protocols, which may initially require token incentivization or swaps with various counterparties using $T.\n\n# Use of Proceeds\n\nThe Initial Funding will be managed under a newly formed IG multi-sig as proposed by the DAO’s Bootstrap proposal ([2/28/22](https://forum.threshold.network/t/tip-13-bootstrap-threshold-dao-guilds/246)), and will be allocated towards IG goals listed above as well as any discretionary incentives from partnerships/relationships focused activities that may fall outside of initial IG scope.\n\n# Expiry / Timing of Initial Funding Spend\n\nThere will be neither an expiry on the allocation spend nor an estimate of when the funds will be spent, but the IG ensures that these funds will be prudently and responsibly allocated towards activities that are consistent with its focus on strategy, partnerships and protocol stewardship.",

      "content": "https://forum.threshold.network/t/proposal-begin-incentivizing-liquidity-to-tbtc-v2-curve-pool/285\n\nPrior to the official launch of the tBTC v2 bridge we will need to have a plan to ensure a liquid market. Rather than waiting for launch to figure this out, I propose that we preemptively direct incentives towards the tBTC v2 Curve pool.\n\nThere are two reasons we should do this:\n\n1. As discussed by @mhluongo on Discord, to establish a Yearn vault we need to have rewards flowing to the tBTCv2 pool. Ideally, the most efficient approach would be that we simultaneously do this with Yearn on launch. However, given that Matt’s experience coordinating this with the yearn team has demonstrated this will be a slow process, we should start the process sooner rather than later.\n2. As we learned with the T launch: being prepared for the launch is incredibly important. Unlike with T, we have the opportunity to prepare the liquidity before we open the bridge with the v2 tBTC in circulation right now. Doing this will help us get a head start and help us incentivize the remaining v1 holders to convert the tBTC.\n\nHow much?\nI suggest that we start incentivizing with 300k T and adjust upwards or downwards based on results after the first epoch.\n\nLinks\nCurve tBTC Pool with 300 tBTC v1: https://curve.fi/tbtc\nCurve v2 Pool with 0.8 tBTC v2: https://curve.fi/factory/41",

If this proposal passes I will immediately work as the front-end developer on ThUSD, 6 hours per day, 5 days a week (Monday to Friday)\n\n**My Background:** I’ve been working as a front-end developer for 5 years, I worked as a full-time Core front-end developer for ElasticDAO and I’m currently working as a core front-end developer, sporadically, at Elasticswap.\n\nI’m skilled in JS, HTML5, Svelte, React, Typescript, Tailwind for CSS, ChakraUI, ThemeUI, Redux, Ethers.js, and Jest (Being using these libraries on a daily basis working full-time dev in a real crypto project)\n\nI have experience in developing the front-end from the beginning - From the initial structuring of the front-end environment, implementation of the layout and logic necessary to interact with the contracts through Ethers.js to the launch of the platform, I have already done it in practice in the release of ElasticDAO mainnet v2 and also with Elasticswap, which currently had its release postponed due to the acquisition of the project by the company 3six9\n\nI have deep knowledge of the Liquity protocol, as I have an active frontend running since the first day of Liquity’s release: liquity.gg 5 - and I also acted as a paid community moderator for Liquity in the first weeks after its release\n\nMy Linkedin profile for consideration: https://www.linkedin.com/in/evandro-saturnino-192b65b0/ 4\n\n**The front-end development of the Threshold USD project will comprise:**\n\n* Elaboration of the design for the application interface, landing page, documentation, and informational pages (This last two, if found necessary by the acting members of the thUSD project) in Figma following the best UI/UX standards and with a visual identity that matches the identity of the current Threshold Network application;\n\n* Front-end development of the application that will interact with the contracts developed by Ben Longstaff and Shawn through the Ethers.js library, as well as all other pages related to the project in a responsive way and implemented following SOLID principles\n\n* React, Typescript, ChakraUI, Redux, Ethers.js and Jest libraries will be used for the development of this work.\n\n* Regression tests using Jest framework will be applied to verify the expected functioning of the functions implemented in the front-end development\n\n* Continuous front-end improvement work, as well as constant maintenance and bug fixing - According to criticality, I will work overtime if necessary.\n\n* I will work together and synchronously with the developers responsible for implementing the project’s smart contracts so that the front-end development will take place in an uninterrupted and dynamic way according to the development stages of the thUSD project.\n\n* The entire project front-end will be developed in an Agile method, in the same way, we used in ElasticDAO development, using Github projects, where all community members will be able to access the development progress in real-time, with a listing of all opened issues and closed with their respective Pull Requests\n\nRepresentatives of the Threshold DAO would (Same conditions previously presented by Ben Longstaff in his proposal)\n\n* Review logged hours against high-level tasks in clockify.me\n* Guild members would have to approve the hours on a fortnightly basis.\n* As the original champion for the project Agoristen would be the product owner and prioritize and\napprove work.\n* The mechanics in this agreement would be reviewed and need to be reapproved as part of the Q2 budget.\n\n**Cost**\n\nThis proposal is for one front-end developer:\n\n* Rate $470 USD per day (6 hours) paid in T tokens.\n* T token price is taken as the global average price as recorded on Coingecko for the day that the work was completed.\n* Hours reviewed and approved fortnightly.\n* Tokens transferred monthly.\n* Contributor Mining Pilot with the option to lock the T tokens for a multiplier\n    - 6 months for 1.2x\n    - 12 months for 1.5x\n    - 24 months for 2x",

      "title": "Bootstrap Threshold DAO Guilds",
      "content": "https://forum.threshold.network/t/proposal-bootstrap-threshold-dao-guilds/246\n\n**Intro**\n\nThis proposal is intended to bootstrap the Threshold DAO by setting up an initial organizational structure that results in a functioning DAO with more scalable decision making capability and more effective treasury capital deployment capability onchain through a multisig committee system.\n\nIt is a synthesis of all the community discussion leading up this point on how to do this. The proposal builds on the current Threshold Marketing Guild proposal and launches the first three Threshold Guild Committees simultaneously.\n\n**TLDR**\n\n* Establish onchain Threshold Guild Committee multisigs for the Treasury Guild, Marketing Guild and Integrations Guild\n* Set the first term for Threshold Guild Committee members to 6 months so we are not locked into a long term system and can iterate on this system where needed\n* Nominate initial committee members based on previous proof of building within Threshold Guilds so far with ensuing Threshold Guild * Committee members elected by Token Holders\n* Give each guild committee member a $2.5k per month grant cost averaged in T from the Threshold DAO treasury over the course of the period so they are fairly compensated and aligned with the success of the network\n* Keep team members and NuCypher team members will be on Threshold Guild Committees but will decline guild grants from the Threshold DAO treasury\n\n**Why Threshold Guild Committee Multisigs?**\n\nRequiring granular proposals to pass through a 10-day Token Holder Governor Bravo vote is not scalable for decision making, not gas efficient and results in unnecessary governance fatigue that will distract valued stakeholder attention away from bigger, prominent proposals.\n\nFor example, a Threshold Marketing Guild proposal to create a new educational video should not need to pass a full Token Holder DAO vote. This takes too long and could result in Token Holders collectively spending more in gas than it costs to create the video. If micro decisions and micro capital deployments are repeatedly handled by full Token Holder Governor Bravo based proposals the Threshold DAO will be hamstrung by governance fatigue and not be able to scale effectively.\n\nCreating Threshold Guild Committee multisigs for each established branch of the DAO solves these problems by delegating more granular working group decision making and capital deployment to committee members allowing the Threshold DAO to operate more effectively in a way that ultimately adds more value to the network.\n\nThe Threshold Guild system also enables Threshold DAO members to self-select into community subgroups to earn and work together towards a common goals based on interest and expertise. However, leaders and overall direction is needed for each of sub groups which manifests in the form of these onchain committees.\n\n**Threshold Guild Overview**\n\nThe Threshold community already has four working branches that have each individually proven an ability to execute and bring value to the Threshold DAO: the Threshold Council, the Threshold Marketing Guild, the Threshold Integrations Guild and the Threshold Treasury Guild. Each Threshold Guild has different responsibilities:\n\n**Threshold Marketing Guild**\n\nThe Threshold Marketing Guild is responsible for general Threshold marketing across services, growing our network contributors, onboarding new members to the Threshold DAO, educating people about the value of Threshold and more. So far, this has resulted in community lead events such as Twitter Spaces and Discord calls, animated educational videos, asset design, newsletters, blog posts and more. This proposal outlines the expected responsibilities of the Threshold Marketing Guild in more detail.\n\n**Treasury Guild**\n\nThe Threshold Treasury Guild is responsible for effectively managing the Threshold DAO treasury. This has included growing Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL), earning money for the Threshold DAO through POL farming strategies, creating draft Threshold DAO budgets, approving arb opportunities, establishing liquidity incentive direction for T, developing treasury diversification strategies such as a treasury swaps with strategic partners. A full list of previous Treasury Guild meeting notes is on the forum here for more detail on previous activity.\n\n**Integrations Guild**\n\nThe Threshold Integrations Guild is responsible for developing DAO to DAO relationships for Threshold and creating partnerships for the network with a current focus on tBTC v2 opportunities. So far the Integrations Guild has helped generate tBTC v2 listings on mStable and Curve effectively navigating the governance ecosystem on both protocols. This guild has also developed and maintained valuable DAO relationships with other communities such as KeeperDAO . A full list of previous Integrations Guild meeting notes is on the forum here for more detail on previous activity.\n\n**Committee Members**\n\nThis proposal calls for nominations of inaugural Threshold Guild Committee members based on previous proof of building within the community. Nominations for this proposal are outlined below and have been sourced directly from the community from conversations within each guild.\n\nNominations are intended to kick start the Threshold Guild system onchain and reward early Threshold DAO builders but ultimately we want a more decentralized approach. As such, future Threshold Guild Committee Members will be elected by our Token Holders.\n\n*Inaugural Threshold Marketing Guild Committee Members:*\n\n* Nous\n* MrsNuBooty\n* Jessi\n* ZeroInFo56\n* Weedzy\n* JohnPackel (Advisor)\n* Carusosa (NuCypher)\n* Liz_S (Keep)\n\nThis multisig Threshold is set to 6 of 8 and can be changed by the guild committee if needed.\n\n*Inaugural Threshold Treasury Guild Committee Members:*\n\n* LakeLaogai\n* Eastban\n* billiboiadams\n* MyCouchPullsOutButID\n* ben\n* sashatanase (Keep)\n* Will (Keep)\n* derek (NuCypher)\n* davidnunez (NuCypher)\n\nThis multisig Threshold is set to 6 of 9 and can be changed by the guild committee if needed.\n\n*Inaugural Threshold Integrations Guild Committee Members:*\n\n* Eastban\n* ben\n* MyCouchPullsOutButID\n* Naxsun\n* rusty (Keep)\n\nThis multisig Threshold is set to 3 of 5 and can be changed by the guild committee if needed.\n\nNon-voting council members can be added to committee multisigs (where needed) as a fall back fund recovery mechanism to reduce the risk of a loss of Threshold DAO funds.\n\n**Initial Time Frame**\n\nThis is a new approach for us and we will learn as we do. We need to be flexible and leave room to iterate on the Threshold DAO structure but still want guilds to have enough time to “find their groove”. The time frame for inaugural guild committee members is six months. For example on the iteration, we may end up deciding that subdaos are a better alternative to multisig committees and want to implement them as the next evolution of the DAO structure.\n\n**Guild Committee Compensation**\n\nAll dev team members on inaugural Threshold Guild Committees will decline any grants which means that there is no conflict of interest in me writing the compensation portion of this proposal.\n\nWe want to compensate Threshold DAO builders well to retain our current valuable contributors and attract new builders in the future. Based on conversation leading up to this proposal each Threshold Guild Committee Member will spend around 8 hours per week per guild working to build the network.\n\nInaugural committee members will earn $2.5k cost averaged in T per month. That equals $15k for the course of the six month period or the equivalent rate of $150k per year based on the suggested hour commitment.\n\nIn addition, Threshold Marketing Guild committee members can take bounties within the Marketing Guild for more comp if their work exceeds 8 hours (more on this in the Future Budgets section of this proposal).\n\nA note here - there is nothing stopping us from iterating on comp methods in the future. For example, those who put more hours into Threshold may be able to submit a full time employment proposal to Token Holders with more comp. In the future, we likely want to tie comp to target results but this approach is more sophisticated and the DAO needs to walk before it can run.\n\n**Accountability**\n\nHours will not be tracked but there should be some form of initial accountability in the DAO while we work towards a more sophisticated accountability process. For the sake of simplicity and unblocking the DAO on alignment, detailed accountability and rules mechanisms are not included in this proposal. This will likely result in a separate discussion and alignment period. For reference, solid suggestions have been discussed so far such as the creation of a Threshold Rules Committee with @jakelynch and @Nous or a Peoples Guild responsible for creating and managing OKRs across the DAO. Exact mechanics are as previously stated WIP. In my opinion, a Threshold Peoples Guild that sets OKRs, tracks committee member weekly progress and manages payroll is a good way to have onchain accountability in the DAO because this guild can cancel payment streams if commitments are not upheld. However, this is outside of the scope of this proposal.\n\nIf this proposal passes each Threshold Guild Committee will work together to create individual Guild OKRs that are transparently shared with the rest of the Threshold DAO (a process that is underway in some shape for most guilds). Threshold Guild Committee members will also be expected to share weekly updates on Discord so that Token Holders can transparently track progress.\n\nAs a simple accountability mechanism in the event that an inaugural Threshold Guild committee member ignores responsibilities the Threshold Council can vote to remove them from a guild committee at which point they will be removed from the multisig and lose the remainder of their T grant. This is expected to be an unlikely event.\n\n**Further Guild Budgets**\n\nOur approach has always been to create an inclusive DAO environment where anyone interested in building with us can onboard and earn for their work. In line with this each guild will have a discretionary budget to fund community proposals and give contributors outside of the committees a chance to participate and earn. This is particularly relevant to the Marketing Guild where the intention from the committee members is to create a proposal process and a job board where community members can take bounties for completing specific marketing-related tasks.\n\nIn a previous proposal, the Threshold Marketing Guild requested the need for a $50k discretionary budget in T which is here. That funding request will be separated out into a concurrent snapshot with this proposal for Token Holders to approve or deny from our DAO treasury. However, that funding proposal being executed is reliant on this proposal passing.\n\nNext, if this proposal is enacted and when needed the Threshold Treasury Guild and Threshold Integrations Guild can request discretionary budgets from the DAO treasury based on the previous budget work of @ben and other nominated members of the Treasury Guild.\n\n**Future Guilds**\n\nThese three Threshold Guilds are just the start of the DAO. This proposal sets a precedent for how future guilds can be structured. Future guilds might include a Threshold Peoples / Rules Guild, a Threshold Product Developers Guild (h/t @arj), or a Threshold Mods and Support Guild.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf passed this proposal unblocks the community and results in establishing a functional foundational structure for the Threshold DAO. It is comprehensive but will not solve every problem we face and more problems will inevitably emerge. One example is Treasury Guild frontruns. We will learn and build on this foundation as we go with the introduction of more guilds, more checks and balances and more DAO structure on our continued path towards progressive full decentralization of the network’s governance.",

      "title": "Funding Threshold USD development",
      "content": "# Background\nThis [proposal](https://forum.threshold.network/t/proposal-request-for-funding-thusd-smart-contract-development/218) is for the Threshold Network DAO to fund the smart contract development of a decentralized stable coin with decentralized collateral.\n\n[Agoristen proposed](https://forum.threshold.network/t/proposal-threshold-usd-thusd-interest-free-loans-with-tbtc-as-collateral/107) a [Liquity](https://www.liquity.org/) fork with the following high level changes:\n\n* No governance token.\n* Fees accruing as Protocol Controlled Value for the Threshold Network DAO.\n* Accepts TBTC as collateral.\n* Interest rate.\n* An initial loan against the protocols future fees will be minted for use by the Protocol Controlled Value in the stability pool, see the docs below for more details.\n* Some upgradable components.\n\nThe goal is that like the initial version of Uniswap the usage will be driven by utility not tokenomics.\n\nA task force was established to work on how Threshold USD should work, you can read more details in the links below:\n\n* [Threshold USD draft](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/9qa9WNjoqR7W4K5MxEREpGpt6cjib2qJz55E3wpr5eo/)\n* [thUSD Interest Rate Specs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18uj3x-3oRdkNUmI4F8Kl6-r25KkpQ_CKO8EPx8TQlF4/edit?usp=sharing)\n* [The soft-ceiling dilemma](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/tu6ghHIK7TOdE2a5K6x1p9sB7jFXLZOaZJXxPA8hl4o/)\n* [B. Protocol Proposal](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/wgRSKfZThfqyjbqzKuyEUW4vYfefBGx7cRL5cZEk5U4/)\n* [B. Protocol QA](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/2bSFQrHnlQVOzJBbia+DQ67FW0fUxXiTGRHX2Jaa-5w/)\n\n## So What?\nAllowing TBTC holders to borrow stables against their bitcoin should increase the TVL in TBTC as bitcoin holders can participate in defi without having to swap to WBTC first.\n\n## Who Cares?\nT holders will benefit from:\n\n* Increasing TBTC TVL, this is an important metric for integrating with larger defi protocols.\n* Fee’s from the loans would go to the Threshold Network treasury.\n\n## Why Us?\nYou can read about my experience as a developer on LinkedIn ([I have a nice collection of recommendations](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ben-longstaff-1574389/)), my friend Shawn worked on [Wallet & Apple Pay, Apple Card and Apple Cash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/webstersx/) and currently works for a bank.\n\n# Project Risks\n### Risk: Overcoming Impermanent Loss (IL)\n\nTo function correctly requires being able to acquire thUSD to close under collateralized TBTC positions. A TBTC to thUSD pool would be subject to IL, since there will be no token to subsidize the IL.\n\n### Mitigation:\n\nThe Threshold Network DAO would establish\n\n* POL in a pegged BTC pool with TBTC.\n* POL in a stable pool with thUSD.\n\n### Risk: Insufficient Depth\n\nWithout a yield, pools are unlikely to achieve sufficient depth to be useful. Accumulating sufficient POL to provide the depth is a longer term strategy. This requires a short term incentive.\n\n### Mitigation:\n\nThe Threshold Network Treasury has a strategy to diversify into assets that include gauge weight so the DAO can create a yield for LPs in pools related to Threshold Network without needing an ongoing T subsidy. The DAO is building a CVX and CRV position through its T - ETH POL, A similar strategy that was used to bootstrap this liquidity could be applied.\n\n### Risk: Getting value for the DAO\n\nSoftware development is notorious for scope creep, running over time and over budget.\n\n### Mitigation:\n\nRepresentatives of the Threshold DAO would\n\n* Review logged hours against high level tasks in clockify.me\n* Guild members would have to approve the hours on a fortnightly basis.\n* As the original champion for the project Agoristen would be the product owner and prioritize and approve work.\n* The mechanics in this agreement would be reviewed and need to be reapproved as part of the Q2 budget.\n\n### Risk: Scope creep\n\nThere are a number of non-trivial changes to the Liquity protocol, which opens the door to deep research and modeling.\n\n### Mitigation:\n\nThe scope of this work would be limited to smart contract development, testing and deployment.\n\n* Economic modeling and risk assessment would be outsourced by the DAO separately with a strong preference to the teams that Liquity worked with.\n\n### Risk: MVP Development Risks\n\nThere needs to be a balance between shipping code in a timely manner and shipping safe code. The more complicated additions are in how the Protocol Controlled Value works.\n\n### Mitigation:\n\n* Having portions of the code be upgradeable with a time delay.\n* External DAO funded code audits.\n\n### Risk: Rugging funds\n\nHaving upgradeable components puts the funds at risk of being stolen through a malicious upgrade.\n\n### Mitigation:\n\n* Upgrades approved by the DAO.\n* Upgrades having a time delay before being able to be applied.\n* The Threshold Council can veto malicious upgrades if sufficient votes were able to be obtained.\n\n# Cost\nThis proposal is for two smart contract developers.\n\n* Rate $1,100 USD per day (8 hours) per developer paid in T tokens.\n* T token price taken as the global average price as recorded on coingecko for the day that the work was completed.\n* Hours reviewed and approved fortnightly.\n* Tokens transferred monthly.\n* Contributor Mining Pilot with the option to lock the T tokens for a multiplier; 6 months for 1.2x, 12 months for 1.5x, 24 months for 2x\n\n# FAQ\nQ: How long will it take to build?\nA: Difficult to estimate, this is why an Agile software development approach will be used.\n\nQ: Would you consider doing it cheaper?\nA: No.\n\nQ: What are these multipliers about?\nA: The goal is to align contributors’ long term success with the project’s long term success.\n\nQ: When can you start?\nA: When a vote passes and a review team is selected and approved.\n\nQ: How many days a week can you commit?\nA: 4\n\nQ: If the scope grows larger than anticipated, what is the worst case max spend the DAO is committing to before the DAO would vote to approve again?\nA: 4 days x 6 weeks x $1100 USD x 2 (2 year lock up multiplier) x 2 people = $105,600 USD\n\nQ: What about the front end?\nA: A* is going to put together a design doc with an overview, technical details and scope for a funding proposal.\n\nQ: Does this proposal include the cost of auditing?\nA: No. Cost TBD.\n\nQ: Have you built a simulation for the economic model changes?\nA: No. External risk assessment to be done by Gauntlet or similar, cost TBD.\n\nQ: How much experience with smart contracts do you have?\nA: We haven’t deployed anything to Ethereum mainnet, I have written some Hyperledger Fabric smart contracts. Anything considered learning wouldn’t be included in the logged time.",

      "content": "The purpose of this document is to provide a high level summary of mStable for the proposed treasury swap.\n\nProposed swap high level notes:\n\n* Tokens to be held for a minimum of 12 months.\n* Exchange rate set by a 30 day moving price average.\n* Target acquisition size of 250,000 MTA tokens.\n\n# Utility to Threshold DAO\n## Joint Marketing\n**Feature**:\nThis would be the first treasury swap for the Threshold DAO and signal to other DAOs we are open for business.\n\n**Benefits**\nJoint marketing campaign.\n\n## Staking in governance.\n**Feature:**\nMTA tokens can be staked to vote with the mStable Emissions Controller 1 to direct emissions to the tBTC v2 Feeder Pool.\n\n**Benefits:**\nIncreases the APY that TBTC holders can earn. Participation in governance earns MTA rewards (~14%).\n\nCurrently the tBTC v2 Feeder pool receives approximately 0.25% of rewards.\n\nPurchasing 250,000 tokens would buy sufficient vote weight to increase that to approximately 3%. Note that this would change with additional partner staking.\n\nAssuming constant price and reward allocations it would take approximately one year for the initial investment to be distributed as rewards to stakers in the feeder pool. Note that this is a ballpark calculation and excludes any increase in vote power from staking.\n\n### MTA Staking Notes:\n* Vote weight receives a multiplier based on time staked and quests completed.\n* 3 week cooldown period + 2 week unstaking window.\n* Withdrawal fee of 7.5% for the first 3 weeks that decays over 48 weeks to 0%.\n* Earn a share of monthly staking rewards (approximately 20% APY).\n* MTA staking rewards unlock over time\n* MTA rewards for feeder pool vaults\n* 1/3 of MTA rewards are claimable immediately\n* 2/3 of MTA rewards are streamed linearly after 26 weeks\n\n# Utility to mStable\n## Staking to generate additional income for the DAO\n**Feature:**\nT tokens could be staked to generate revenue for the mStable DAO Treasury either in the coverage pool or as a network operator.\n\n**Benefits:**\nDiversification of DAO income streams.\n\n## Joint Marketing\n**Feature:**\nThis is an opportunity to build on the existing partnership with shared governance and treasury diversifications.\n\n**Benefits**\nJoint marketing campaign.\n\n# mStable Summary\nThe mStable community independently added a tBTC v2 feeder pool, see the proposal and forum post.\n\n* Fully Diluted Tokens:\t100,000,000\n* Inflation:\tnone\n* Emissions:\t[See Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vSUb2bb3g5peXPbiU1UMj4IvoUiyMiYoPdYDPdN7tfUMXKBpLGNcI-vEF5VkqozJ7r9t6_ktbL30wJ9/pubhtml#)\n* Circulating Supply:\t28,505,551\n* Audits: Consensys Diligence, Bramah Systems, Certik, PeckShield, DeFi Safety: 97% Score\n* Fees:\t0.02% swap fee between stable assets. 0.02% redemption fee from mUSD or mBTC to the underlying assets.\n* Features:\tYou can earn by putting mUSD or mBTC into the save vaults.\n* Protocol Risks:\tPermanent loss of the peg for one of the assets in the basket.\n\n\n# FAQ\n**Q:** How are token prices determined?\n**A:** Global average price as recorded on CoinGecko for the day in question.\n\n**Q:** What day does the 30 day moving price average start?\n**A:** Once the proposal has been passed in both DAOs and price data from [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/96698a6a80f64cb1ae27f813032bfaa9) for T is available on CoinGecko.\n\n**Q:** What date does the token hold period begin?\n**A:** On the date that tokens are exchanged.\n\n**Q:** Why not do a larger transaction?\n**A:** This is the Threshold DAOs first treasury swap and will be a learning experience. If the swap proves successful and governance power in mStable generates the expected value for members of the Threshold Network DAO then the treasury would evaluate putting forward a second swap to accrue additional gauge weight.\n\n**Q:** Can the quests in mStable to increase vote weight be done by the DAO?\n**A:** Yes this can be completed with Wallet Connect.",

      "content": "**Background**\nCurrently the Threshold Network has an ETH loan that it is using to LP in the T - ETH Curve pool. This pool is currently being incentivised through Votium, the DAO is capturing approximately 60% of the incentives from the pool.\n\n**Motivation**\nBuilding out Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL) means that the DAO does not need to continue “renting” liquidity through liquidity incentive programs. The DAO is able to take a longer time horizon and wear the impermanent loss (IL) risk which ensures that liquidity does not get pulled in times of volatility when community members need access to liquidity. Providing liquidity also generates assets for the DAO through the fees collected as an LP.\n\n**Proposal**\nAllow the Threshold Council to deposit up to 150M T as single-sided liquidity to the T - ETH Curve pool until March 31, 2022, with no more than 10% slippage in aggregate.\n",
