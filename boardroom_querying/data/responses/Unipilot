The reward pool for this epoch is 6,769.82 oA51 distributed among 5 different strategies. Only those users who are either Balancer LP's of A51/ETH pool or Quickswap LP's of A51/MATIC pool can vote for their weightage in the emission to be distributed. Each epoch is 15 days long.\n\nThe rewards will be distributed based on the overall users share of liquidity in the A51 strategies and Balancer A51/ETH pool, to maximise your rewards, make sure to have greater liquidity share in the balancer pool.\n\nAt the end of each epoch, the rewards will be airdropped to the LP addresses.\n\nRead more details on: https://a51-finance.gitbook.io/a51-finance/tokenomics/foo-tokenomics",

Check the stats here: https://dune.com/a51finance/a51-stats\n\nConsidering that there has been ample time between the token migration and now, we should move towards setting a deadline for the token migration after which all the unclaimed tokens would be burnt.\n\nThe first proposal is to set 1 July as the final deadline 2 months from now and 6 months after the token migration. The second proposal is to set 1 October as the deadline 5 months from now, and 9 months from the token migration date.\n\nPros to burn unclaimed A51 tokens\nThis will eliminate any supply overhang that might scare new investors and they will be confident that there won’t be any new tokens coming into circulation all of a sudden.",

So early january could be more suitable in terms of market recovery.\n\n- In December, the testnet competition will commence which will run for the whole month, as well as the audit for the product is expected to be submitted by mid december to last 10 days of december. This means that the mainnet launch will happen by late january. Launching in early january means there will be less gap between token and product launch.",

Yet, we've encountered limitations tied to a single DEX and our brand's scope.\n\nToday, to counter that limitation, we propose a transformation: A51 Finance. This brand represents our vision to explore multi-chain DeFi. A51 Finance embodies dynamism and adaptability, symbolising our commitment to the ever-changing DeFi landscape. It will encompass the utility of the current existing protocol and offer a much bigger and broader set utilities to its users.\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidnhwes3hhet2jamf6tzqcc6ffr4257yb2vzooams4gbayrxj4ccq)\n    \nExplore the proposal in depth: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Il6lAwczY7YDn4Q_KE8YF1kjzZzJseP-6FuvpAoGPds/edit?usp=sharing",

      "content": "Farming has been a feature on Unipilot since launch, designed to incentivise the provision of liquidity. However, with most of the Active pairs providing triple-digit returns to LPs via earned liquidity fees, the extra returns from farming are not a strong additional incentive and lead to increased $PILOT inflation and sell pressure. This in turn harms those who decide to buy and hold $PILOT. \n\nBy ending farming, we can significantly reduce $PILOT inflation, which combined with the imminent launch of staking and other improvements to tokenomics, would benefit our community of holders.",

      "title": "Proposal: Make the Index Fund productive",
      "content": "Under the current system, revenue earned by the Unipilot protocol is sent to the index fund, which is currently worth $230,000 (link below). Assets in the fund are idle and are not productive. \n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x95477f96f78ec38916b5457030387d844e886ab3#tokentxns\n\nThis proposal suggests that we make this capital productive by using these funds to add liquidity on Unipilot, likely to the USDC/ETH pair. To do this, we would swap all non-ETH, non-PILOT assets in the index fund to USDC and then swap as necessary any ETH to USDC so that we have the required ratio of ETH and USDC for adding liquidity.\n\nThis protocol-owned liquidity would be incredibly productive as 1) returns in this vault are typically in excess of 100% APR and 2) the protocol would earn 100% of fees earned from the liquidity vs. the usual 20% that it earns from users’ liquidity. Therefore, adding just $200k of protocol-owned liquidity would be equivalent to TVL rising by $1m in terms of revenue generated. \n\nThis move could grow the treasury (previously called \"index fund\") in an exponential manner. For example, with an APR of 100%, $200,000 would turn into $400,000 after one year and $800,000 after two years, ceteris paribus. \n\nIncreasing returns for the treasury means higher rewards for stakers, as well as reduced $PILOT token emission (inflation), as the revenue generated can also be used to cover costs such as salaries and growth. And remember, as the protocol continues to generate revenue, more can be added to these positions to further increase returns.\n",
