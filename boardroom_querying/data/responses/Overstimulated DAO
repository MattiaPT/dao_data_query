For those unfamiliar with the full process, you can read about it in the Overstimulated Journey.\n\nIt hit all its targets and allowed the team to explore new verticals and segments for capital formation and community building.\n\nTo keep growing, it’s important that Daniel set up the proper legal structures to ensure the longevity and ongoing sustainability of his artist project and all future releases.\n\nThis proposal looks to allocate a budget to put a legal firm on retainer, geared at ensuring that Overstimulated is properly accounted for - and setting a precedent for how future Daniel Allan projects should be structured.\n\nMotivation\n\nOverstimulated is the first of many projects from Daniel Allan.\n\nWe feel its extremely important to operate above board and ensure that all bases are covered for contributing to the Overstimulated DAO.\n\nThe remaining ETH in the treasury should be allocated towards covering legal expenses and setting up a foundation for the next chapter of Daniel Allan.\n\nThis should set the stage for how to treat all future royalties, secondary sales and liquidity from the Overstimulated EP that’s currently pointed at the Overstimulated treasury.\n\nBeyond the passing of this proposal, the Danial Allan team will follow up with a new proposal around the next chapter of the DAO using the findings from the legal work performed with the proposed ETH.\n\nSpecification\n\nDistribute 10 ETH from the Overstimulated Treasury to danielallan.eth to put Gordon Law on retainer.\n\nThe ETH allocated will be converted to USD at current market value at the passing of this proposal.\n\nRemaining ETH and USD will go towards taxes and setting up legal structures for the next major Daniel Allan project.\n\nVote\n\nYes - Allocate 10 ETH towards legal costs\nNo - Do not allocate ETH",

The expectation is that the exposure across these platforms will drive traffic back to the source of the music on Spotify. \n\nMotivation\n\nWhile Music NFTs are the primary source of revenue for Overstimulated, it’s important to spread the projects’ likeness to bring new fans into the ecosystem.\n\nDespite seeing success with Music NFTs, Overstimulated has not had breakout success on streaming platforms like Spotify or Apple Music.\n\nThis campaign looks to develop a larger audience for Overstimulated on streaming platforms, with the ultimate goal of landing algorithm playlists like Discover Weekly, Your Daily Mix, Radio and Release Radar.\n\nIn doing so, this cements Overstimulated for many cycles to come - beyond the lifecycle of the campaign.\n\nThis route is essentially the counter-balance to web3 sales, focusing more on a wide canvas as opposed to Music NFTs which favor superfans.\n\nSpecification\n\nDistribute 5 ETH from the Overstimulated Treasury to danielallan.eth to be used for Spotify curation (ETH will be converted to USD at current market value). \n\n",

      "title": "$OVERSTIM / ETH Distribution Proposal",
      "content": "Summary:\n\nAllocate 20 ETH and 22,000 $OVERSTIM to core contributors for their work on Overstimulated.\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis proposal looks to allocate ETH and $OVERSTIM to the individuals who played a driving role in bringing Overstimulated to life. \n\nFor a recap on what’s been accomplished since launch - please review the original Mirror post at https://danielallan.mirror.xyz/.\n\nThe primary recipient of these funds is Daniel Allan - the creator of Overstimulated.\n\nA quick note from Daniel on life as an artist:\n\n“It isn’t what most people imagine most of the time. When I moved to LA, I did almost everything but work on my art. My life was filled with mix work, producing for other people, and random one-off jobs. I was in constant need of creative liberation and could never seemingly break the cycle of doing things I didn’t like to do to keep the lights on. Creativity is like a muscle and if you are not constantly working at it it will atrophy.”\n\nOutside of Daniel, there are other key members of the Overstimulated community who spent nights and weekends on bringing this project to life in a truly web3 native fashion.\n\nMotivation:\n\nAs recounted in the Overstimulated Mirror post - $50,000 was meant to be earmarked as a salary for Daniel.\n\nComparing it to an advance, this proposal is the community’s ability to decide whether or not Daniel and team are deserving of the allocations listed below.\n\nIn music you never know when your next check is. \n\n“There were times in my first year of living in LA where I had a few days to scramble on how to pay rent, and that really started to weigh down on my creativity. I started making art that would pay my bills rather than art that felt genuine and I have had to play a lot of creative catchup since then.” - Daniel\n\nIf passed, this proposal should serve as motivation to future artists that communities have the ability to fund creator’s livelihood.\n\nSpecification:\n\nAt the time of writing, the Overstimulated DAO - found at 0x800b7EDD31E46FA3a2900DaCBDa7f7067aF3d917 - holds 51 ETH and 40,000 $OVERSTIM.\n\nThis proposal looks to distribute 20 ETH from the Overstimulated Gnosis Safe to danielallan.eth as a living salary.\n\nIn addition, 22,000 $OVERSTIM will be distributed to the following contributors:\n\nDaniel Allan (Creator) - 15000 $OVERSTIM\nLisa (Creative Director) - 2500 $OVERSTIM\nHenry Chatfield (Community Manager) - 2000 $OVERSTIM\nBrett Shear (Strategic Advisor) - 1500 $OVERSTIM\nBonfire (Product Development) - 500 $OVERSTIM\nCece Palmquist (Marketing) - 500 $OVERSTIM\n\n\nAll recipients of $OVERSTIM are subject to a three-month vesting period from the passing of this proposal.\n",
