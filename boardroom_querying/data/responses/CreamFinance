      "content": "## Summary\nEthereum Cream depositors experienced a total loss after the October 2021 exploit. Whitehats from the AMP exploit recovery have already received 12.5% of recovered funds. It’s time to recover this bounty and put it toward compensating exploit losses from the October 2021 exploit. \n\n\n## Action\nFOR: Cream Team must stop payment to whitehats named “Lossless/ Pascal” and distribute remaining, 1932.15 ETH, to all impacted depositors on Ethereum Cream based on percentage of Supply - Borrowed assets valued at October 28, 2021, excluding crETH2 deposits. \n\nAGAINST: Cream Team makes no change and pays out the remaining 1932.15 ETH to the whitehats named “Lossless/ Pascal”.\n\n\n## Background\nIn August 2021, Cream Ethereum was exploited. Two “whitehat” groups emerged, with the first earning 10% bounty and the second earning 50% of the remaining 90% of returned funds. Standard industry bounty for whitehat is 10%. Condition for 50% bounty according to the blog post required “leading to the arrest and prosecution” of the perpetrators - none of this ever happened yet somehow we as a protocol honored a 50% bounty without a vote. \n\nIn October 2021, another exploit happened that made the Cream Ethereum system to become insolvent, leaving depositors in a total loss scenario. Then the team gave back everything they got back- yearn yCRV recovered and the crETH2 rugged back from the exploiter. Plus they gave up all of their team vesting and treasury tokens.\n\nEveryone got hurt - token holders, team, depositors. Just not these whitehats. \n\nAccording to Cream Dev:\nThe current agreement is a 50% bounty of recovered funds to the whitehats in Lossless/ Pascal from the AMP exploit from August 2021. The bounty is being paid out over a 2 year period linearly:\n\n- Recovered funds: 5152.5 ETH\n- 50% bounty: 2576.25 ETH\n- Payments for 6 months so far: 644.1 ETH\n- Remaining for this bounty: 1932.15 ETH\n\n## Motivation\nTo find all available funds to use toward recouping losses for depositors. \n\n\n## Rationale\nIndustry standard is 10% of recovered funds for whitehats. We have already overpayed these second set of whitehats by giving them 12.5% of recovered funds. Plus they did not meet the conditions of “leading to the arrest and prosecution” of the perpetrators.\n",

Finance will transit the existing Fantom markets from app.cream.finance to Yearn frontend, and it will become the Fantom Iron Bank at launch.\n\nThe right of the listing decision will also be transferred from Listing Committee to the Iron Bank team, which is consistent with the current practice of Ethereum Iron Bank.\n\n**For**\n> Approve the transition\n\n**Against**\n> Do nothing\n\n## Motivation\n\nIron Bank on Ethereum has reached $1B total supply, and the credit limit / whitelisted borrowing has been proven capital efficient with our partners Yearn and Alpha Homora. With Iron Bank launching on Fantom, we can extend the same practice to Fantom, and work with Yearn for the greater market.\n\n## Specification\n\nOnce the voting has passed, the team will begin the transition to Fantom Iron Bank.\n\nDuring the transition, user can access Fantom Iron Bank through both C.R.E.A.M. Finance and Yearn frontend. It will be a roughly four weeks transition period, with start date and end date to be announced. This allows user to get familiar with the new entrance to Fantom Iron Bank.",

Finance governance.\n* iceCREAM staked translates to voting power which can be used to determine allocation of CREAM token liquidity mining by chain and market (e.g.- Ethereum, ETH).\n\nIf liquidity mining is enabled on borrow markets (more on this as part of phase II)\n\n* Once you vote, your vote will remain directed at pools unless modified.\n* Users will have the ability to change their votes every week and will be able to allocate their iceCREAM to different pools.\n* iceCREAM allows the user to control CREAM emissions across all C.R.E.A.M. markets in the future.\n* iceCREAM increases emission from a base factor of 0.4 to a max of 2.5x, the more iceCREAM you stake, the more CREAM you earn.\n\n## Minting iceCREAM\n\nAssuming 1000 CREAM vote-locked:\n\n\n| minted | vote-locked\n|--------|------------\n| 1000 | 4 years\n| 250 | 1 year\n| 127.4 | 6 month\n| 63.7 | 3 month\n| 21.23 | 1 month\n| 4.79 | 1 week\n\n## Long-Term Staking CREAM can vote\n\nFor the early supporters of C.R.E.A.M. Finance who locked their CREAM in the long-term staking program, these token holders should be entitled to governance alongside iceCREAM holders, but will not be eligible for emission boosts.\n\n## Phased Implementation\n\nWe propose to implement this new tokenomics in a phased approach, where Phase 1 implements locking CREAM into iceCREAM, migration of voting from CREAM to iceCREAM, and distribution of protocol fees to iceCREAM stakers.\n\n**For**\n> Move to CREAM as a productive earning asset\n\n**Against**\n> \"Do nothing\"\n\n## References:\n\n* oSUSHI: https://forum.sushi.com/t/sushinomics-introducing-osushi/4055\n* veToken: https://ve-token-voting.vercel.app/",

Coordinape enables DAOs to scale communities with tools to reward contributors, incentivize participation, and manage resources.\n\nToday, C.R.E.A.M. Finance uses Coordinape to allocate payments to all non-core team members.\n\nWe propose that Coordinape receives a grant of $50,000 $USDC from the CREAM Treasury.\n\n>For: Grant Coordinape $50,000 $USDC to help them scale their offerings and continue working closely to fulfill the needs of C.R.E.A.M. Finance.\n\n>Against: Do Nothing.\n\n## Motivation\n\nC.R.E.A.M. Finance uses Coordinape and we want to see them succeed.\n\n## Background\n\nHow does Coordinape work: Each Coordinape member will have a set quantity of “allocation points” -- which they can distribute to other members whom they have worked with during a given month. Members with the most interactions and allocations will receive weighted portions of the grants budget.\n\nAs described by Tracheopteryx of Yearn Finance, the ultimate goal is to “move more decision-making powers off of the multisig’s shoulders and onto a network of autonomous and self-managed teams.”\n\nWe want to ensure all community members get paid for work they are doing to benefit C.R.E.A.M. Finance ... and want to provide a grant to Coordinape to see this become a reality.",

He is a passionate developer and a DeFi subject matter expert.

Level C2 was chosen with the expectation that we will submit further CF increases in the future, after \"market seasoning\", after some time in market passes at 10% CF.\n\n**For**\n\nCollateral factor of VSP, VVSP is increased to C2 level.\n\n**Against**\n\nDo nothing.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe are trying out the new C-levels system.  Please give us your feedback!\n\nFor CREAM:   CREAM is already proving popular within the Vesper community, based on the recent listing and community chatter.  This is introducing CREAM to a blue chip retail/institutional DeFi audience, as well as the usual increases-CREAM-TVL rationale.\n\nFor Vesper, this opens the power of \"AxB\" DeFi lending, which opens a large array of new possibilities for Vesper users, in particular the VVSP token (similar to XSUSHI) token.\n\n> self-disclosure of the downside\n\nCollateralized lending is considered an important step in VSP and VVSP token maturation as DeFi lego bricks of high utility.   It would slow down Vesper.\n\n## Background\n\nWebsite: https://vesper.finance/\nDapp: https://app.vesper.finance/\nDocumentation: https://docs.vesper.finance/\nGithub: https://github.com/vesperfi/\n\n## Specification\n\n* Increase VSP collateral factor to level C2.\n* Increase VVSP collateral factor to level C2.",

FEI has launched a new DeFi primitive in the form of protocol governed liquidity to create a new form of stablecoin asset. FEI is looking to create a new stablecoin that seeks to stabilize itself not via IOU-based debt commitments, rather through a monetary peg-based policy on the basis of protocol controlled reserves. **FEI currently has $736 million in protocol controlled value**. As a collateral asset, C.R.E.A.M could be one of the first lending protocols where much of the $595 million circulating FEI supply can be supplied or borrowed against it, and the opportunity to use the protocol-controlled value (736 million dollars) as liquidity.\n\n**Options for the proposal:**\n\n**For:** List FEI as a collateral asset on C.R.E.A.M. \nFEI Token address: 0x956F47F50A910163D8BF957Cf5846D573E7f87CA\n\n**Against:** Do nothing\n\n## Benefits to CREAM:\n \nFEI holders have a need to lend/borrow, and the Fei DAO has the ability to provide liquidity to these pools using the Protocol Controlled Value of currently **$736 million(~260k ETH)**. Fei plans to use PCV funds to enable the FEI DAO to set and manage interest rates in a lending market, and C.R.E.A.M could be the first to take advantage of this opportunity.\n \nBy adding FEI as a collateral asset, C.R.E.A.M will increase TVL and generate more usage.\n \nThe Fei team has committed to publicly marketing and promoting the CREAM suite of products (27k+ followers).\n \n## DeFi Integrations:\n \nUni V2: FEI-ETH and FEI-TRIBE have been the largest liquidity pairs on Uni V2 since its launch, with a 7-day volume of $581 million and $73 million.\nUni V3: FEI/USDC pools currently have $305 million 7 day volume\nFEI circulating supply: $593 million\nChainlink: The FEI/ETH price feeds are live on mainnet: https://docs.chain.link/docs/ethereum-addresses/#mainnet\n \nPrimary resources for Fei can be found on this website:\n[Website](https://fei.money)",

      "content": "[Read original post on forum](https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-add-woo-as-a-collateral-asset/1630)\n\n## Summary \n\nWe think $WOO would be a great addition to the Cream Finance platform. Wootrade is a liquidity solution and trading network used by 20+ institutions. The community is rapidly growing and as of now, the token isn’t listed on any other lending platforms in the DeFi space. This would be a good opportunity to introduce Cream Finance to an active community of DeFi users. Wootrade is also very vocal and eager to integrate and support other DeFi platforms.\n\n\n**For**\n> Add WOO as a collateral asset\n\n**Against**\n> Do nothing\n\n## Additional Details\n\nCoinGecko ranking: 143\n\nMarket cap: ~600m USD\n\nToken holders: ~7000 (Ethereum)\n\nCurrent markets: Huobi (spot and futures), Gate, MXC, AscendEx (Formerly BitMax), WOO X Beta, Uniswap (ETH and USDC), SushiSwap (USDC), Bancor, Hoo\n\n*Wootrade can be simplified into three main parts:*\n\n1. A B2B institutional trading network\n\n2. WOO X Beta, an exchange for active traders\n\n3. DeFi liquidity solution with on-chain capital\n\nAll three are related to Wootrade’s key strength, which is providing the cheapest liquidity in the space. Wootrade does this by using a zero-fee method, which they are able to provide due to their background as institutional quantitative market makers (Kronos Research). The founders have extensive experience at top traditional finance firms like BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, etc. They are backed by top VCs including Dragonfly Capital, Three Arrows Capital, and Fenbushi Capital.\n\n## Integrations in DeFi to date:\n\nWOO/ETH on Uniswap - TVL: $17.2 m\n\nWOO/USDC on Uniswap\n\nWOO/USDC on SushiSwap\n\nWOO/BNT on Bancor\n\nWOO/USDT on Mdex\n\n## Token Security:\n\nWOO does not have an elastic supply, or rebase mechanism. The Wootrade ERC-20 contracts do not have permissions that grant administrators unrestricted mint/burn capabilities. WOO is a capped-supply token with a total supply of 3 billion tokens and circulating supply of 432,413,779.00 WOO. The contracts and addresses with the highest concentration (top 10 and >1% of circulating supply) of WOO tokens are the token vesting contracts, one Huobi wallet, one Bitmax wallet, team wallets and a wallet with 1.86%.\n\n## Community and Communication\n\nWootrade is active on Reddit and Telegram. The Wootrade team also operates official Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and Medium accounts. Github activity is limited to the Wootrade documentation, with activity since 27th August, 2019. The development team is presented on the Wootrade website. The team integrates Kronos Research co-founders Jack Tan and Mark Pimentel.\n\nThe team's official e-mail contact is admin@woo.network.\n\n## Token Distribution\n\n[WOO holder list](https://etherscan.io/token/0x4691937a7508860f876c9c0a2a617e7d9e945d4b#balances)\n\n443,484,750 / 2,992,996,746 WOO are unlocked. The locked token are stored in gnosis multi-sig wallets with 3-5 senior management required to move a transaction. Token breakdown is as follows:\n\n1. Ecosystem Rewards (Locked - 50% rewards, 20% Ecosystem partners, 20% WOO Ventures, 10% Insurance fund)\n2. Team tokens (Vesting over 3.5 years on linear per block basis)\n3. Team vault (Locked -Un-allocated team tokens)\n4. Seed Round (Vesting over 3.5 years on linear per block basis)\n5. Advisor token vault (Locked)\n6. Huobi - Exchange Wallet\n7. Liquidity Management Wallet (Locked)\n8. WOO X Exchange Wallet\n9. Institutional Staking Wallet\n10. BitMax Exchange Wallet\n11. Private Sale Wallet (Fully Vested)\n12. Burn Address\n\n## Available Audits\n\nThe WOO ERC-20 token contract is a standard OpenZepelling contract. The Wootrade contracts have not been audited yet.\n\n## Links:\n\n[Website](https://woo.network/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wootraderS)",

BIFI is the governance token of beefy.finance, a cross-chain yield optimizer with over $700M in TVL.\n\n### Action Item\n**For**\n> Add BIFI as collateral asset\n\n**Against**\n> Do nothing\n\n## Motivation\nBeefy Finance was the first yield optimizer on Binance Smart Chain, launching in September 2020 during the platform’s infancy. It has since expanded to HECO, AVAX, Polygon, and Fantom. Beefy currently has 200+ vaults continues to move fast, deploy new vaults, and launch on new platforms.\n\n## BIFI Token\nBIFI serves as a governance and revenue sharing token. A percentage of vault profits are shared with token stakers. The token supply is fixed and all distribution has been completed.\n\n## Benefits for Cream\nBeefy Finance is one of the most popular yield optimizers on all platforms. Its multichain strategy aligns with Cream's own values. BIFI’s presence on Cream would provide additional TVL to Cream and an opportunity to earn additional fees as BIFI holders would come to Cream to collateralize their assets.\n\n## Current liquidity\n* $12M on Pancake, $5M on MDEX, $3.2M on Apeswap\n* Some liquidity on Polygon DEXs\n* Available on Binance, MXC, Hotbit\n\n## Links\n**Platform**\n* [App](https://app.beefy.finance/)\n* [Stats](https://dashboard.beefy.finance/)\n* [Docs](https://docs.beefy.finance/beefyfinance/faq-1/tokenomics-and-governance)\n* [Github](https://github.com/beefyfinance)\n\n**Social**\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/beefyfinance)\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/beefyfinance)\n* [Telegram](https://t.me/beefyfinance)\n\n**Other**\n* [Certik audit](https://certik.org/projects/beefyfinance)\n* [Binance Listing](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/f616b3b12724418eb8de89ce58fe3c27)",

      "content": "[Read original post on forum](https://forum.cream.finance/t/segment-governance-votes-and-create-listing-committee/1596)\n\n## Summary \n\n*Written by [Regan Bozman](https://twitter.com/reganbozman) and [Pierre Chuzeville](https://twitter.com/PChuzeville) from Dove Mountain Partners*\n\nC.R.E.A.M. should separate Critical Proposals from Light Proposals, and create a Committee that handles decision making for Light Proposals.\n\nThese two types of proposals would have different parameters which affect the length and execution of a proposal:\n\n* Critical proposals that affect would require more voting time and a higher vote differential.\n* Light proposals that affect asset listings and collateral requirements would require less voting time, can be quickly implemented - they should be delegated to a Listing Committee\n\nAs part of this change, we should also adopt [Kiba’s proposal to create a Listing Committee](https://forum.cream.finance/t/create-cream-listing-team/861) and move all decisions around listing new assets and changing collateral requirements to this Listing Committee.\n\nThe Listing Committee will consist of 5 Nominees who are voted in by the CREAM token holders. Nominees should decide on Listings, Collateral Cap, Collateral Factors and Reserve Factors. This will enable much quicker governance decisions and also allow CREAM to avoid listing all new tokens as 0% collateral. \n\n**For**\n> Create two types of proposals with different parameters which affect the length and execution of a proposal.\nCreate a C.R.E.A.M. Listing Committee\n\n**Against**\n> Do nothing\n\n## Motivation\n\nC.R.E.A.M. community members have voting fatigue because they need to approve small changes to the protocol. Currently, the governance forum is overloaded with requests related to assets listing and Collateral Factors. Consequently, critical proposals are lost among others. \n\nThe C.R.E.A.M. protocol development process is slowed down, participation rates are relatively low, and discussion is not encouraged enough. This is mainly due to a lack of structure, order and clarity, leading to a messy governance process.\n\nCurrently, the community votes on every Collateral Factor and new asset. This has a number of issues:\n\n* Creates voting fatigue for token holders because they’re asked to vote so frequently\n* Dilutes bigger governance changes \n\nCreating a listing committee will make speed up new listings. The community can still make proposals for new assets to be added to C.R.E.A.M. platform. The proposal above attempts to balance speed of iteration with avoiding a descent into plutocracy. This will onboard more collateral to increase TVL and fees.\n\n## Specification\n\n**Light Proposals**\n\nLight proposals would include:\n\n* Asset Listing\n* Reserve Factors\n* Collateral Factors\n* Collateral Caps\n\nWhat is included in governance proposals labeled as Light Proposals could evolve over time, and anyone is free to make suggestions.\n\nLight proposals would be handled by a Listing Committee, who must make a binary decision. If YES wins (at least 3 positive votes), they have to reach an agreement on Reserve & Collateral Factors as well as Collateral Cap, within 2 days.\n\n**Critical proposals**\n\nThey require more voting time, a higher vote differential, and are not handled by a specific Committee.\nThis is where the main strength of decentralized governance comes into play: community members should be able to express their opinion directly or at worst delegate their voting rights to trusted actors. Critical Proposals are the ones which must go through the full governance proposal lifecycle (we are planning to propose some updates here soon).\n\n**Listing Committee**\n\nThe 5 Nominees must have a diversified background to foster discussion while remaining flexible and agile to move fast. We believe that the ideal committee looks something like this:\n\n* 2 C.R.E.A.M. Core Team members\n* 2 active community members\n* 1 lending protocol (other than C.R.E.A.M.) active contributor\n\nThis design was inspired by the [Synthetix Spartan Council](https://blog.synthetix.io/the-spartan-council-has-now-been-elected/).\n\n*Voting*\n\nEach Nominee would receive an NFT that gives him or her 1 vote. If enough voters amend their votes such that someone who is not a council member ranks higher than a council member, then the the DAO will manually retrieve the NFT from the departing Nominee and issue it to the new Nominee, giving them Nominee voting rights. \n\nC.R.E.A.M. DAO will need to create a modified version (or custom contract) of an NFT which can be revoked and issued to EOA’s (Externally Owned Addresses), signifying a wallet is part of the Listing Committee.\n\nEach parameter - Collateral Cap, Collateral Factor, and Reserve Factor - requires a minimum of three positive votes, in order to be listed. Nominees can also make proposals on new assets to list, and should discuss asset listing related community proposals in the forum.\n\nMinimum proposal length is 24 hours and maximum is set to 5 days.\n\n*Election*\n\nNominees election period would last 7 days, and would be renewed every 3 months. Existing Nominees from the current Listing Committee Epoch can remain on the Committee but will still be able to be voted out via people changing their votes in the poll.\n\nIn case of emergency, token holders can vote out a Nominee if the decisions made are not considered as aligned with the interests of C.R.E.A.M. Finance. The number of seats can be modified via an Improvements Proposal.\n\n*Limited Powers & DAO Discretion*\n\nThe C.R.E.A.M. DAO has a veto power and can require a revote at its discretion, but this should happen only in emergency situations - the processes should all be optimized to minimize this potential occurrence.\n\nRewards\n\nAssets listing, Collateral Cap, Reserve Factors and Collateral Factors are strategic parameters to ensure the longevity of the protocol. Such changes are highly related to downside risk of the whole protocol. \n\nTherefore, Nominees need to be incentivized: they will get 25 CREAM tokens per month as rewards, which would vest over a 12-month period.",

As the first three of these assets have now gone live for borrowing and lending, the next logical step is to allow users to collateralize their vault tokens and borrow against them. This will bring greater TVL to C.R.E.A.M. and also drive borrowing demand, increasing returns to depositors and to the protocol itself. \n\n## Background\n\nC.R.E.A.M. currently has two v1 yVault tokens listed as collateral—yUSD and yETH, both listed at 60% collateral ratio. Thus, this proposal matches the current standard by allowing 60% collateral ratio, and also recognizes the stability of assets denominated in USD and ETH that are also yield-bearing. Furthermore, this proposal acts in continuation of the [previously announced merger](https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-cream-v2-merger-e9fa6c6989b4) between C.R.E.A.M. and Yearn and the milestones that were outlined. \n\nYearn Finance is an aggregator service for decentralized finance (DeFi) investors, using automation to allow them to maximize profits from yield farming. Yearn is currently the 2nd largest yield protocol (in TVL ranking - source: [Defi Llama](https://defillama.com/protocols/yield)) and the 15th largest DeFi protocol overall (in TVL ranking - source: [Defi Llama](https://defillama.com/protocols)).\n\n\n**For**\nIncrease collateral factor of yvCurve-IronBank, yvCurve-sETH, and yvCurve-stETH to 60%.\n\n**Against**\nDo nothing.",

      "content": "[Read the original post](https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-add-wscrt-as-a-collateral-asset-on-cream-ethereum/1062)\n\n## Summary\n\nProposal by Secret Network community member SCRTisland\n\nThis proposal would add WSCRT (Wrapped Secret) as a collateral asset on CREAM Ethereum.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWrapped Secret (WSCRT) allows ethereum users to bridge between the world of ERC20 tokens into the privacy-preserving Secret Network tokens and back at a 1:1 rate. This allows bi-directional flow of many assets to take advantage of Secret Network’s privacy tokens, including adding CREAM as a secret version to our network as secretCREAM.\n\n## Background\n\nSecret Network is the first blockchain with privacy-preserving smart contracts. That means applications built on Secret can utilize encrypted data without revealing it to anyone, even the nodes in the network. For the first time, Secret Network allows developers to build powerful, permissionless, privacy-preserving applications - Secret Apps.\n\nSecret is the native coin of the Secret Network, a decentralized network for private / secure computation. Nodes on the network (known as secret nodes) can perform generalizable computations over encrypted data, which allows smart contracts (known as secret contracts) to use private and sensitive data as inputs. WSCRT is the wrapped version of SCRT which allows a 1:1 bridge from SCRT to WSCRT.\n\nAll assets bridged to the Secret Network are minted using SNIP-20 (ERC-20 like contract based token issuance) standard. All SNIP-20s are privacy tokens as secret contracts are full encrypted (input, state, output). These secretTokens can be swapped on SecretSwap with front-running and miner-extractable value (MEV) resistance. This is again possible given the encrypted nature of SNIP-20 tokens.\n\n## Useful Links\n\n* Main Website: https://scrt.network/\n* ERC20 Bridge: https://bridge.scrt.network/eth\n* SecretSwap: [https://bridge.scrt.network/](https://bridge.scrt.network/eth)swap\n* Documentation: https://build.scrt.network/\n\n## Benefits for CREAM\n\nFirst mover advantage - no competition on SCRT borrowing / lending\n\n1. Yield opportunities for CREAM community through borrowing SCRT: CREAM users can participate in SCRT related yield opportunities (SCRT staking), SushiSwap Onsen without acquiring SCRT.\n2. Access to SCRT community through SCRT lending: CREAM will become the first platform to offer borrowing and lending of SCRT. Secret Network community is extremely strong, vocal and eager to support related projects. This listing would bring a strong influx of new users, who would use SCRT as collateral to participate in ETH DeFi.\n3. TVL potential: the total economic value available in SecretNetwork is approximately $600mn\n4. Potential to add aToken to the Secret Bridge to create wrapped aTokens with privacy. aTokens can be added to the Secret Network bridge if needed by the CREAM community)\n\n## Benefits for Secret Network Community\n\n1. Ability to borrow / lend WSCRT and participate in leveraged ETH DeFi.\n2. Awareness gain among Ethereum DeFi users for the front-running resistant DeFi ecosystem Secret Network is building.\n\nRisk Mitigation:\n\nSecret Network has been live on mainnet for more than 1 year. SecretTokens have been tested thoroughly in production since October 2020. There is ~$80mn worth of Secret Tokens minted, which was used by +[6,000 unique users with more than 50K computations](https://secretnodes.com/secret/chains/secret-2/contracts). Secret Network Ethereum bridge has been live since December 2020, used by 2,200 unique users. Currently the bridge provides privacy to $75mn worth of Ethereum assets.\n\nSCRT metrics\n\nDays > 365\n\nTransactions >200,000\n\nHolders > 13500\n\nMarket Cap ~ $210mn\n\nVolume ~ $7mn\n\n**For**\n\nAdd WSCRT as a collateral asset on CREAM Ethereum.\n\n**Against**\n\nDo not add WSCRT as a collateral asset on CREAM Ethereum.",

      "title": "Increase BOND Collateral Factor to 25%",
      "content": "**Summary** \n\nBOND, the governance token of the BarnBridge risk tokenization protocol, has been eligible for depositing into, and available for borrowing from, Cream since the turn of the year. Since then, the project has successfully established its DAO and launched its SMART Yield application. SMART Yield currently has $80M in TVL, putting it in the top three projects within the DeFi Pulse [\"Derivatives\"](https://defipulse.com/) category. \n\nThis proposal seeks to raise its collateral factor from 0% to 25%. The updated collateral factor would reflect the significant progress the protocol has made since the initial onboarding of the BOND token, and stands to further strengthen ties between our two communities. Currently, no other platform supports collateralized borrowing against BOND.\n\n**For**\n> Increase the collateral factor of BOND to 25% \n\n**Against**\n> Maintain its current collateral factor of 0%\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThis change is being proposed to reflect the progress the BarnBridge protocol has made since the initial onboarding of the BOND token. In that same vein, the proposed 25% collateral factor reflects that there is still much to be done: onboarding new originator markets beside cUSDC and cDAI, launching SMART Alpha, and achieving greater uptake of our senior SMART Yield tranches, primarily. We have positive outlooks on all three fronts, but recognize that the collateral factor can be raised via future vote as subsequent progress is made.\n\nFurther increasing ties between the Cream and BarnBridge communities could also help launch an integration with our SMART Yield application. SMART Yield allows for users to mint either fixed or levered variable rate products based off of underlying debt pools (e.g. Cream USDC would be one), and the BarnBridge DAO has the power to incentivize supported pools should the community vote accordingly. \n\n**Background**\n\nAt the core of the BarnBridge thesis is the market need for diverse yield products. Two particular attributes we are focusing on are the ability to take fixed rate positions, and higher variable risk exposures from a single asset pool. We are taking an approach that’s tried and true in traditional financial markets called risk tranching.\n\nTranching risk allows investors to take targeted positions and exposure on yield producing assets. These financial assets are generally known as collateralized debt obligations, the most popular of which are mortgage backed securities.\n\nTranching is the process of subdivided a pool of assets into risk categories with different return profiles. Typically the more conservative and lower risk / lower return pools are called senior tranches and the more aggressive higher risk/ higher return pools are called junior tranches.\n\n![image|662x499, 50%](upload://vavVjec1YxWRFXI68fdAyUJemxf.jpeg) \n*Example of the tranched debt pool (for Illustration purposes only)*\n\nThe end goal is to create derivatives that give liquidity providers a more diverse set of tradable products that meet their evolving needs. This should create more liquidity in the market for debt products and attract new capital into the DeFi space.\n\n**Specification**\n\nThe contract address for BOND can be found at 0x0391d2021f89dc339f60fff84546ea23e337750f.\n\nYou can interact with SMART Yield and our DAO at app.barnbridge.com.\n\n### ===contents above are drafted by Max_BarnBridge===\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/increase-collateral-factor-of-bond-barnbridge-to-20/1567",

      "content": "Summary:\nAdd VSP and VVSP to the CREAM Finance Ethereum lending market as supported collateral assets.\n\nContract: 0x1b40183efb4dd766f11bda7a7c3ad8982e998421\nContract: 0xba4cfe5741b357fa371b506e5db0774abfecf8fc\n\nFor:\nAdds VSP and VVSP as collateral to CREAM Finance lending app.\n\nAgainst:\nNo Change Required.\n\nBackground\nVesper is dedicated to making DeFi easy-to-use, combining the benefits of a professional approach with the inherent advantages of DeFi. Vesper routes user deposits of major crypto-assets — currently ETH, WBTC, USDC, LINK, and Vesper’s own VSP token — across various DeFi protocols to generate yield. Over time, the project seeks to expand the number of strategies and platforms integrated as well as supported deposit assets — thus this proposal.\n\nThe market responded well to the Vesper launch, trusting Vesper with more than $1 billion in Total Value Locked within the first six weeks 3. (As of this writing, that number is over $1.5 billion.)\n\nVSP is the native currency to the Vesper ecosystem. VVSP is the governance vault that votes on Vesper proposals and shares revenue in the form of VSP buybacks (similar to xSushi and stAAVE).\n\nMotivation\nA “yes” vote to Vesper’s proposal enables the following:\n\nIntroduces CREAM as a source of yield to the ever-growing Vesper ecosystem.\nEstablishes additional synergy between Vesper and CREAM to push more assets through the proposal process and create more strategies that route through CREAM.\nIncreases net deposits across both ecosystems, and more acutely, significant uptick in volume on both lending and borrowing.\nSpecification\nThe proposal will be pushed to Snapshot voting on April 22nd and run for a duration of 4 days.\n\nDocumentation https://docs.vesper.finance/\nWebsite https://vesper.finance/\nTwitter @VesperFi\nMedium https://medium.com/vesperfinance",

      "title": "List Yearn Finance v2 yVault tokens as collateral assets",
      "content": "### Authors\n@qosmonot, @dudesahn, @lehnberg\n\n### Summary\nThis is a proposal to list [Yearn Finance](https://yearn.finance/)'s yvYFI, yvDAI, yvUSDC, yvWETH, yvCurve-IronBank, yvCurve-sETH, and yvCurve-stETH v2 yVault tokens as collateral assets. Starts with 0% collateral factor (C1).\n\n---\n\n### Background\n\nYearn Finance is an aggregator service for decentralized finance (DeFi) investors, using automation to allow them to maximize profits from yield farming.\n\nYearn is currently the largest yield protocol (in TVL ranking - source: [Defi Llama](https://defillama.com/protocols/yield)) and the 13th largest DeFi protocol overall (in TVL ranking - source: [Defi Llama](https://defillama.com/protocols)).\n\n---\n\n### Motivation\n\nIn continuation of the [previously announced merger](https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-cream-v2-merger-e9fa6c6989b4) between C.R.E.A.M. and Yearn and the milestones that were outlined, we are proposing the addition of the improved v2 yVault tokens as collateral on C.R.E.A.M.\n\nThis would allow users to earn interest on their assets via Yearn's vaults, but still access the borrowing potential of these assets as collateral on C.R.E.A.M. Looking forward, the supplying of yTokens on C.R.E.A.M upon deposit of funds in a vault could be integrated natively on the yearn.finance UI.\n\n#### Users:\nYearn Finance is:\nover 30k YFI token holders\nover 100k Twitter subscribers\nover 15k Telegram members\nover 10k Discord members\nwaiting to further deploy their combined $1.5 billion locked in Yearn products.\n\n#### Update:\nyUSD and yWETH v1 yVault tokens are already supported assets as collateral on C.R.E.A.M. At the time, these were some of the largest vaults on Yearn. However, we are in the process of replacing all v1 vaults with v2 versions for both improved security and profitability. \n\nOn Yearn, the yWETH vault (v1 WETH yVault) has been replaced by yvWETH (v2 WETH yVault) and a migration to the new version is ongoing, with $71 million in our v2 WETH vault compared to only $16 million in our v1 WETH vault. Thus, it makes sense for C.R.E.A.M. to undertake a similar migration toward v2 yvWETH as well. \n\n#### Liquidity:\nAlthough deposits in Yearn's vaults earn considerable interest income, there are still relatively few ways to further collateralize these yield-bearing assets. This proposal would allow the Yearn community to borrow other assets against they yVault tokens, while expanding the C.R.E.A.M. TVL and driving borrowing demand.\n\nTotal Value Locked in Yearn Vaults = over $1.2 billion split between 40 different vaults (*as of April 2021, source: [yearn.vision](https://yearn.vision/)*)\nTotal Value Locked in proposed tokens to be listed = around $750 million (*as of April 2021, source: [yearn.vision](https://yearn.vision/)*)\n\n#### Current vaults:\n**1. yvYFI (v2 YFI yVault)**\nThis vault holds YFI, and utilizes several different strategies to earn yield. \nCurrent TVL = $161 million (*as of April 2021*)\n\n**2. yvDAI (v2 DAI yVault)**\nThis vault holds DAI, and utilizes several different strategies to earn yield. \nCurrent TVL = $121 million (*as of April 2021*)\n\n**3. yvCurve-sETH (v2 Curve sETH Pool yvault)**\nThis vault holds tokens from Curve's sETH (Synthetix ETH) Pool, and locks in the gauge to earn CRV emissions.\nCurrent TVL = $122 million (*as of April 2021*)\n\n**4. yvCurve-stETH (v2 Curve stETH Pool yVault)**\nThis vault holds tokens from Curve's stETH (Lido staked ETH) Pool, and locks in the gauge to earn CRV emissions.\nCurrent TVL = $145 million (*as of April 2021*)\n\n**5. yvUSDC (v2 USDC yVault)**\nThis vault holds USDC, and utilizes several different strategies to earn yield. \nCurrent TVL = $74 million (*as of April 2021*)\n\n**6. yvWETH (v2 WETH yVault)**\nThis vault holds WETH, and utilizes several different strategies to earn yield. \nCurrent TVL = $71 million (*as of April 2021*)\n\n**7. yvCurve-IronBank (v2 Iron Bank Curve yVault)**\nThis vault holds tokens from Curve's Iron Bank Pool, and locks in the gauge to earn CRV emissions.\nCurrent TVL = $62 million (*as of April 2021*)\n\n#### Future additions:\n**8. yvBOOST**\nThis vault holds Yearn's yveCRV, and compounds harvested 3Crv rewards weekly for more yveCRV.\n\n**9. yvWBTC**\nThis vault holds WBTC, and utilizes several different strategies to earn yield. \n\n**10. yvUSDT**\nThis vault holds USDT, and utilizes several different strategies to earn yield. \n\n\n#### Risk:\nAs a result of the value accrual nature of the Yearn yVault tokens, the collateral provided grows in value with time. This means the liquidation ratio / health factor grows over time, independently of the token volatility.\n\nYearn's v2 vaults have been live for several months now, and have implemented various security improvements, including improved vault/strategy shutdown procedures and removal of public `earn` functions.\n\n---\n\n### Benefits\nC.R.E.A.M. benefits:\n- Allowing users to deposit the yield-generating version of assets (yVault tokens) rather than the base assets makes the total yield of deposits more attractive (*ie. depositing USDT on C.R.E.A.M. or a competitior vs. depositing yield-generating yvUSDT on C.R.E.A.M.*).\n- Yearn currently has a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $1.2 billion across all vaults. Listing the yVault tokens will provide a significant TVL increase locked into C.R.E.A.M. v1, as Yearn has the potential to 7x the C.R.E.A.M. v1's current TVL of $240 million. This will translate in a significant increase in fees collected by C.R.E.A.M., as users seek to borrow against these assets.\n\nYearn benefits:\n- Allowing Yearn yVaults to be used as collateral would give an extra incentive for users to deposit funds on Yearn, increase Total Value Locked (TVL) and fees, and dramatically increase capital efficiency & composability.\n\n---\n\n\n### Notes\n- Collateral Factor will start at 0% (C1) as per C.R.E.A.M.'s token listing requirements. A subsequent proposal to raise the Collateral Factor will be drafted following the tokens approval and listing.\n\n- Before listing on C.R.E.A.M., Yearn's yvYFI, yvDAI, yvUSDC, and yvWETH will be migrated to an updated v2 version. yvUSDT, yvWBTC, and yvBOOST are upcoming vaults that are in testing and will be released in the coming weeks. yvCurve-IronBank, yvCurve-sETH, and yvCurve-stETH are existing v2 vaults that are ready to be added to C.R.E.A.M. as-is, and thus would be the first batch to go live. \n\n---\n\n\n### Links\n[yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance) - Yearn Finance\n[yearn.vision](https://yearn.vision/) - for all Total Value Locked data\n[Defi Llama](https://defillama.com/protocols) - for DeFi protocol evaluation / comparison\n[Forum Discussion](https://forum.cream.finance/t/list-yearn-finance-v2-yvault-tokens-as-collateral-assets/1478) - for proposal discussion in C.R.E.A.M.

Gnosis has been around for some time and has been focused on 3 lines of products -> Prediction Markets, DEXs, and Wallets.\n\n- Gnosis Safe is the most used Multisig wallet on Ethereum, with ~$17 Billion USD worth of assets being held in Gnosis Safe contracts\n- Conditional Tokens Framework, a Prediction Market framework used by Omen and Polymarket\n- DEX’s such as GPv1 (Mesa), and the upcoming Gnosis Auction protocol\n\nGnosis recently transitioned to a DAO, and delegated 150K ETH and 8 Million GNO (vested over 8 years).\n\n$GNO token is the governance token that allows voting in order to direct the DAO.\n\n### Motivation\nThe main motivation is to make $GNO more accessible to people through lending and overall liquidity.\n\n$GNO is already quite a liquid token in DEXs and CEXs, as it can be seen in the following pools at time of writing:\n\n- Uniswap (0x3e8468f66d30fc99f745481d4b383f89861702c6) -> ~$16M USD\n\n- Balancer 80/20 (0xe42237f32708bd5c04d69cc77e1e36c8f911a016) -> ~$33M USD\n\n- Balancer 50/50 (0xdbe29107464d469c64a02afe631aba2e6fabedce) -> ~$10M USD\n\n- Sushiswap (0x41328fdba556c8c969418ccccb077b7b8d932aa5)-> ~$1.5M USD\n\nAdditionally, $GNO is listed on Kraken, and has daily volumes of over $300k USD across /ETH, /USD, /XBT, and /EUR pairs.\n\nAn important thing to note is that since the transition to the DAO, GNO has proved to be very correlated with ETH which is useful to provide stability and resilience to the pool of assets on Cream.\n\nWe strongly believe that enabling users to lend and borrow $GNO will help both Cream and GnosisDAO achieve things such as:\n\n- Higher TVL in CREAM\n- Enabling users to vote on GnosisDAO by borrowing\n- Enabling users to participate in BAL and/or Sushi rewards via LPing borrowed funds\n- Enabling GNO holders to generate an interest\n\n### Background\nGNO token address: 0x6810e776880c02933d47db1b9fc05908e5386b96\n\nPrice: $149.00 USD (at time of writing)\n\nCirculating supply -> 1,504,587 GNO\n\nTotal supply -> 10,000,000 (8,000,000 vested to the DAO over 8 years)\n\nNo minting, burning, rebase, and/or transfer fee functions.\n\n",

All Armor coverage is underwritten by Nexus Mutual.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ArmorFi/status/1369235069160800256?s=20\n\nThe benefit to the DeFi ecosystem and its users is that Armor coverage is:\n\n1) Permissionless (Nexus requires KYC), and\n\n2) Flexible with regard to coverage amounts and policy duration (“Pay as you Grow”).\n\nThe **arCore Smart Cover System** tracks user funds and allows cover that is based on the exact holdings, while being billed per second with no cancellation period.\n\nThe upcoming **arShield** product offers LP/Staking coverage that is paid directly from the LP/Staking rewards, offering secure staking for liquidity providers without any upfront costs.\n\n## arNXM and Armor Tokens\n\nThere are two tokens associated with the Armor project, ARMOR and arNXM\n\n1. Armor is the governance token. A total of 1 billion ARMOR tokens are being distributed over two years 1: 65% to community members (including liquidity incentives, see note below), 35% to early team members with a 2-year vesting period.\n\nThe responsibilities for governance include:\n\n* Voting on updates to smart contract code\n\n* Voting on changes to constants used in the fee model (such as premium charge for buyers)\n\n* Voting on the exact time a hack took place\n\n* In addition, the token holders for the ArmorDAO may also vote to be given a share of the revenue made by the arCore Smart Cover and arShield systems.\n\n2. arNXM is the yield bearing token for the arNXM vault.\nThe arNXM Vault accepts the Nexus Mutual wNXM/NXM tokens and puts it to work to produce yield. This is done by unwrapping and staking the wNXM (or NXM) tokens in the Nexus Mutual ecosystem.\n\nUpon deposit of wNXM/NXM, users receive arNXM in return. arNXM can be traded freely, just like wNXM, but it also accrues staking rewards. arNXM produces yield in terms of the underlying token. Holders will arNXM will enjoy:\n\n* Additional yield from staking rewards (Currently ~40% APY)\n\n* Price appreciation as the price of underlying assets appreciates (wNXM/NXM)\n\n* Armor’s coverage for coverage providers’ for minimal risk staking\n\n![|624x232](upload://vsU4Yf6QmCE9pVrPcIJayaxCttJ.png)\n\n## Armor in numbers\n\nFor detailed stats on `Armor.fi` (coverage, staking, premiums paid etc.), please visit: `https://duneanalytics.com/armor/armorfi`\n\n## Benefits for Cream\n\n### Access to Armor’s User Base\n\nArmor brings along with it a vibrant community of 7,000+ community members, across different social media platforms.\n\nThe community is highly engaged as in a little over a month, Armor already surpassed $1 billion USD in total cover amount, which has paid out premiums worth ~$5 million.\n\nAs of now, our ArCore smart cover system offers coverage in over 70 assets. As we increase our coverage purview, it will further drive up our ecosystem’s utility.\n\n### Increased TVL for Cream\n\nThis proposal will allow the CREAM TVL to expand and will allow the Armor community to borrow other assets against their $ARMOR/$arNXM tokens.\n\nAs of writing, ~418,000 wNXM is locked up in the arNXM vault. The arNXM:NXM ratio has increased from 1.0 to 1.04. This translates to an APY of ~26.9% annualized over the underlying asset (NXM). arNXM has several times more liquidity than wNXM on most DEXes too, and will soon have even more when added to Bancor. The arNXM Vault also accounts for over 40% of staked NXM on Nexus Mutual.\n\n### CREAM: Combining Coverage and Lending\n\nBesides developing an Armor and arNXM lending market, there are more interesting initiatives that we could develop with the CREAM community. We see an exciting future where we could potentially combine lending and coverage. This could be a huge win-win for both ARMOR and CREAM since it will enable CREAM users to leverage coverage on all tokens they borrow/lend from/to the protocol.\n\nAs Armor’s coverage purview grows, this collaboration could provide an easier bridge for newer protocols to enter Cream’s lending pool. Lenders and borrowers could safely interact with these tokens, knowing that they are backed by Armor coverage.\n\nAnother interesting collaboration prospect that might interest the Cream community is to mint ArNFTs (Armor's non-fungible token wrapper for Nexus Mutual coverage) using the tokens they borrow -> stake them in our ArNFT Staking Pools and earn yield through Armor's Smart Cover System and Shield Vaults. In simple terms, earn yield through the tokens you borrow.\n\nArmor and Cream are both uniquely positioned to capture this important niche and collaborating will be smart and efficient.\n\n### Contract Addresses\n\nARMOR: 0x1337def16f9b486faed0293eb623dc8395dfe46a\n\narNXM: 0x1337def18c680af1f9f45cbcab6309562975b1dd\n\n### Available Audits\n\nArmor smart contracts are audited by Haechi and Dedaub. Reports are available for review via the ArmorFi GitHub page: `https://github.com/ArmorFi/Audits`\n\n### Exchange Availability\n\nThe top exchanges for trading in ARMOR and/or arNXM are currently Hoo, Gateio, Uniswap (V2), Sushiswap, 1inch Exchange, and Balancer, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\n## Information, sources and socials:\n\nArmor ecosystem documentation: `https://armorfi.gitbook.io/armor/`\n\nCoingecko Armor: `https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/armor`\n\nCoingecko arNXM: `https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/armor-nxm`\n\nMedium: `https://medium.com/armorfi`\n\nTwitter: `https://twitter.com/armorfi`\n\nTelegram: `https://t.me/ArmorFi`\n\nDiscord: `https://discord.com/invite/8HuTB22`\n\n### =====Contents above are drafted by azm=====\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-add-arnxm-and-armor-as-collateral-assets-on-cream-ethereum-with-60-collateral-factor/1438",

This could be a huge win-win for both ARMOR and CREAM since it will enable CREAM users to leverage coverage on all tokens they borrow/lend from/to the protocol.\n\nAs Armor’s coverage purview grows, this collaboration could provide an easier bridge for newer protocols to enter Cream’s lending pool. Lenders and borrowers could safely interact with these tokens, knowing that they are backed by Armor coverage.\n\nAnother interesting collaboration prospect that might interest the Cream community is to mint ArNFTs (Armor's non-fungible token wrapper for Nexus Mutual coverage) using the tokens they borrow -> stake them in our ArNFT Staking Pools and earn yield through Armor's Smart Cover System and Shield Vaults. In simple terms, earn yield through the tokens you borrow.\n\nArmor and Cream are both uniquely positioned to capture this important niche and collaborating will be smart and efficient.\n\n### Contract Addresses\n\nARMOR: 0x1337def16f9b486faed0293eb623dc8395dfe46a\n\narNXM: 0x1337def18c680af1f9f45cbcab6309562975b1dd\n\n### Available Audits\n\nArmor smart contracts are audited by Haechi and Dedaub. Reports are available for review via the ArmorFi GitHub page: `https://github.com/ArmorFi/Audits`\n\n### Exchange Availability\n\nThe top exchanges for trading in ARMOR and/or arNXM are currently Hoo, Gateio, Uniswap (V2), Sushiswap, 1inch Exchange, and Balancer, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\n## Information, sources and socials:\n\nArmor ecosystem documentation: `https://armorfi.gitbook.io/armor/`\n\nCoingecko Armor: `https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/armor`\n\nCoingecko arNXM: `https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/armor-nxm`\n\nMedium: `https://medium.com/armorfi`\n\nTwitter: `https://twitter.com/armorfi`\n\nTelegram: `https://t.me/ArmorFi`\n\nDiscord: `https://discord.com/invite/8HuTB22`\n\n### =====Contents above are drafted by azm=====\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-add-arnxm-and-armor-as-collateral-assets-on-cream-ethereum-with-60-collateral-factor/1438",

To increase TVL on Cream and the utility of FRAX, the collateral factor of FRAX needs to be increased on Cream.  Over time, I expect that FRAX will be treated similarly to fully collateralized stablecoins for collateral purposes.  In the near term however, I believe that 60% is a reasonable starting point.  For reference, each FRAX token is currently collateralized by $0.88 of USDC and interest bearing equivalents.  This provides a significant margin of safety for Cream; in the event that the fractional algorithmic model suffers a crisis, there is more than enough collateral to fully cover Cream liabilities (88% collateral vs 60% CF on Cream).  Increasing the CF should allow Cream to become an early hub of FRAX lending and borrowing.  \n\nFrax is also working on new products that incorporate Cream directly.  Getting FRAX and FXS borrowing and lending on Cream is a first step towards realizing innovative products that could drive significant value to Cream.  If you would like to see this happen, please engage with my proposal to add FXS to Cream [here](https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-list-fxs-as-a-collateral-asset/980).\n\n## Background\n\nMore information about Frax can be found at https://frax.finance/ and https://docs.frax.finance/.  The [original proposal](https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-list-frax-as-a-collateral-asset/326) to list FRAX on Cream also has a lot of information, though FRAX has grown significantly since then.  \n\nFRAX had approximately $12.5m of volume in the past 24 hours on Uniswap.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.\n\n### =====Contents above are drafted by raspystacks=====\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/increase-the-collateral-fator-of-frax-to-60/1171",

      "title": "List NFTX as Collateral Asset",
      "content": "**For:** List NFTX as collateral asset on CREAM\n**Against:** Do nothing\n\n### Overview\n\nNFTX is a platform for issuing ERC-20 tokens that are backed by NFTs. These tokens are called funds, and allow for investors to have exposure to NFT markets without needing to trade/hold individual NFTs. Using the decentralized exchange, It is possible for users to create and trade funds based on any NFT such as CryptoPunks, Hashmashs, CryptoKitties, and Avastars. An overview of listing/upcoming NFT index funds can be found on the documentation site: https://docs.nftx.org/nft-index-funds/index-funds\n\nWith increasing interest in the NFT market, the NFTX governance token can bring immediate and long term value to the Cream platform.\n\nIn addition, NFTX has successfully launched Sushiswap Onsen farms for seven fund pairs, and the NFTX token itself:\n\nCryptopunks:\nPUNK-ETH: 0x092493a22375de1b17583d924abf9e8bf884491c\nPUNK_BASIC-ETH: 0x0267bd35789a5ce247fff6cb1d597597e003cc43\nPUNK_FEMALE- ETH: 0xca2ae9c5c491f497dc5625feaef4572076c946c5\nPUNK_ATTR_4-ETH: 0x608f8af5fd49b5a5421f53f79920c45b96bda83f\nPUNK_ATTR_5-ETH: 0xd54a895623552853f8d673981cc32eb8f3929dfb\nPUNK_ZOMBIE-ETH: 0x0e7e8dde18e4016ccc15f12301a47ef7b87bdafa\n\nHashmasks:\nMASK-ETH: 0xfd38565ef22299d491055f0c508f62dd9a669f0f\n\nNFTX:\nNFTX-ETH: 0x31d64f9403e82243e71c2af9d8f56c7dbe10c178\n\n### NFTX Mechanics\n\nNFTX has 2 types of funds on its platform: D1 and D2.\n\nD1 funds are ERC-20 tokens represented 1:1 by an underlying NFT. When an NFT is added to a particular pool e.g., for basic CryptoPunk, an ERC-20 token for that pool is given in exchange. This ERC-20 token can be traded, added to a D2 fund, or redeemed for a random NFT in the underlying pool of basic CryptoPunk.\n\nD2 funds are ERC-20 tokens represented by multiple D1 funds. For example, the PUNK D2 fund is backed by multiple CryptoPunk pools such as basic Cryptopunk, female CryptoPunks, etc. These tokens are the ones most commonly purchased by investors looking for broader exposure to NFT markets.\n\n### Initial audit\n\nLevel K (Nov 2020)\n\n### Token metrics (March 2021)\n\nCirculating supply: 420K (650K total)\nDaily trading volume: ~$5.0M (Sushiswap, Uniswap)\n\n### Technical resources\n\nNFTX Github: https://github.com/NFTX-project\nNFTX docs/litepaper: https://docs.nftx.org/\nNFTX token contract: 0x87d73e916d7057945c9bcd8cdd94e42a6f47f776\n\n### Social Resources\n\nNFTX Website: https://nftx.org/#/\nNFTX Discord: https://discord.gg/hytQVM5ZxR\nNFTX Blog: https://blog.nftx.org/\nNFTX Twitter:https://twitter.com/NFTX_\n\n### =====contents above are drafted by kaw182=====\n\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-add-nftx-as-collateral-asset/1054",

At the same time, THORChain communities are working on [Cosmos (ATOM) 、Polkadot 、Zilliqa、Monero/Haven、BitcoinCash and Solana.](https://twitter.com/thorchain_org/status/1333663042173763584)\n\n## $RUNE\n\n$RUNE is the governance token of THORChain. The function of $RUNE in the Thorchain network is as the settlement asset that secures the network through the token economy. $RUNE is also used as an incentive to reward liquidity providers and subsidize gas. $RUNE was one of the best performing exchange tokens in 2020, and gained more than 3000% last year.\n\nTHORChain recently released ERC-20 $RUNE in addition to the BEP version of the token. Since launching the ERC-20 version of $RUNE in mid-January, liquidity on Sushiswap has already passed US$15M.\n\n## Benefits for CREAM\n\nBEPSwap is the cross-chain DEX powered by THORCHAIN built on the Binance Chain - THORChain plans to replace this with their cross-chain dex ASGARD - this will help the CREAM ecosystem bridge ERC20 and BEP assets.\n\nTHORChain is included in CREAM partner’s Sushiswap’s 2021 roadmap as the ideal partner for Sushiswap’s crosschain DEX integration. There are also numerous token pairs in the Yearn ecosystem that could benefit from crosschain options.\n\nWith so many incredible developments from $RUNE and the huge potential market of cross-chain DEXes, we predict that $RUNE will be the next blue chip DeFi asset. This will bring more TVL to CREAM over time.\n\n#### Action Item\n\n**For**: Add $RUNE to CREAM.\n\n**Against**: Do nothing.\n\n(ERC) $RUNE Contract Address: 0x3155ba85d5f96b2d030a4966af206230e46849cb\n\n### =====contents above are drafted by MagicRabbit=====\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/list-rune-as-collateral-asset/777",

      "content": "**Summary**\nWe propose to list PERP for lending and borrowing.\n\nFor: List PERP\nAgainst: Do nothing\n\n**Background**\nIn case you haven’t heard of the Perpetual Protocol ([perp.fi](https://perp.fi)), here is a quick recap:\n\nPerpetual Protocol is a decentralized perpetual contract protocol for every asset. With the help of our virtual AMMs (vAMMs), traders can trade perpetual contracts with up to 16x leverage without the need to wait for a counterparty.\n\nPERP is the native token of the Perpetual Protocol, and there are two utilities for it:\n1. Staking:\nPERP holder can stake their tokens on the protocol. In return, they’ll be rewarded with the staking rewards (in PERP) and a cut on the transaction fees (in USDC).\n2. Governance:\nStakers can use their staked PERP to vote on 1) the next new market to be included on the protocol and 2) the important parameters of the protocol.\n\n**Milestones**\n* The cumulative trading volume reaches 100M USDC in less than 3 weeks after launch.\n* The peak single-day trading volume is over 80M USDC.\n* The number of unique traders per day is over 100.\n![image|690x362](upload://9md7OjfOuUqcZlV6IiQxJ6VeQuT.png) \n\n\n\n**Benefits to CREAM**\nDue to PERP’s recent price surge, some LPs have exited the Balancer LP Rewards Program provided by the team for fear of the impermanent loss. As such, by accepting PERP as the collateral on the protocol, CREAM could capture additional TVL from these PERP holders whose assets currently sit idle.\n\n**Specification**\nList PERP at a Collateral Factor of 0%\n\n**Audits**\nThe protocol has been audited by Peck Shield and Consensys. The audit report from the former can be found [here](https://github.com/peckshield/publications/blob/master/audit_reports/perpfi_audit_report_2020_46_en_1_0.pdf).\nAnd we also have an ongoing bug bounty program with up to 10% TVL inside the Clearing House contract as the bounty rewards.\n\n### =====contents above are drafted by weitingatperp=====\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-list-perp-as-a-collateral-asset/757",

      "content": "**Summary** \n\nProposal to list LON as an asset available for supplying and borrowing\n\n**For**: List LON\n**Against**: Do nothing\n\n---\n\n**Tokenlon**\n\n[Tokenlon](https://twitter.com/tokenlon) is a decentralized exchange and payment protocol. It was incubated by the imToken in 2017 and currently runs as a separated product and team. imToken is one of the largest decentralized digital assets wallets in the world trusted by millions of users.\n\nAs one of the first teams building decentralized exchanges in the space, Tokenlon launched its first decentralized exchange in March 2018 and has gone through five major iterations. \n\n**Tokenlon Highlights**\n* Tokenlon is one of the top decentralized exchanges by both volume and number of users. 150k users have traded more than $8B volume on Tokenlon so far.\n* Tokenlon is one of the most profitable DeFi applications in the space, ranked as one of the top decentralized applications by revenue by stats tracked by TokenTerminal.\n* Tokenlon is in a unique position to bring imToken’s ten million users to its conversion funnel.\n\n**LON token**\n\nThe LON token is the utility token of Tokenlon protocol. Token holders can participate in the community governance and enjoy privileges like receiving trading fees discounts while using Tokenlon protocol.\n\n**Benefit for Cream**\n\nTokenlon has a very large community (150k+ existing traders and 10m+ users of imToken wallet) and a good amount of token holders (47k addresses holding LON token). However, as LON token was issued just recently, it is currently not available on any lending platform.\n\nBeing the first lending platform to add LON as a collateral asset will introduce Cream to a large number of users and become the first place for them to lend LON. LON currently has a market cap of $137m (circulation supply), if 20% of it goes to Cream for lending, Cream’s Total Value Locked (TVL) can increase by roughly 15% at the time of writing.\n\nIn short, adding LON on Cream can introduce Cream to millions of potential users and increase Cream’s TVL by a very good amount.\n\n**Specification**\n* Token standard: ERC-20\n* Token address: 0x0000000000095413afc295d19edeb1ad7b71c952\n\n**Audit**\n* PeckShield: https://files.tokenlon.im/downloads/PeckShield-Audit-TokenlonV5-v1.0.pdf\n\n**Liquidity**\n* Centralized exchanges\n  * OKEx, MXC, KuCoin, Hoo, and many smaller ones\n* Decentralized exchanges\n  * Tokenlon\n  * Uniswap (LON/ETH, $34m liquidity at the time of writing)\n  * Sushiswap (LON/USDT, $36m liquidity at the time of writing)\n\n### ===contents above are drafted by Lucas_Tokenlon===\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/list-lon-tokenlon-as-a-collateral-asset/893",

      "title": "List OCEAN as Collateral Asset",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nHello everyone, I am very excited to propose OCEAN listing on CREAM finance platform. Ocean Protocol is a decentralised data exchange protocol which enables data providers to monetise their private data using compute-to-data technology. Ocean Protocol's datatokens act as on-ramp and off-ramp for data assets into DeFi. Ocean Market integrates Balancer AMMs for swaps, and LPing directly on data assets (Ocean datatokens)\n\nI see this collaboration as a really good fit for both OCEAN and CREAM communities. Here’s why -\n\n## About $OCEAN\n\nOCEAN, the native token of the Ocean Protocol is already a well traded token with average daily trading volume in excess of $115 mn and tradable on many major CEX like Binance, Poloniex, Gateio, Bittrex, and Kucoin. But more importantly, it has very sizable liquidity and available on Defi platforms like Uniswap, SushiSwap, Balancer, Bancor, Dharma and Kyber. We will be collaborating with more partners in Defi space.\n\nWith our recent Ocean v3 launch, we have moved firmly into the DeFi space and a natural progression is to create an OCEAN lending market. We can’t think of a better place to do this than with the CREAM community. Being able to borrow and lend OCEAN would enable holders to collateralize their OCEAN.\n\nOcean Protocol Foundation is ready commit to providing initial liquidity of about 625k OCEAN tokens (approx. $500,000 USD), along with contributions from our strong community of OCEAN holders. This initial lending by Ocean Protocol Foundation will also provide legitimacy to the lending pool and attract other community members to lend/borrow OCEAN.\n\nSome Stats about Ocean Protocol\n\n* $320M marketcap (source - coingecko)\n* Top 100 project in CMC and Coingecko by Market Cap\n* 42k+ twitter followers and 11k+ telegram community\n* OCEAN token has $115 million daily traded volume (source - coingecko)\n* TVL on [Ocean Market](https://market.oceanprotoocol.com) is approx $882,935 USD equivalent in OCEAN tokens and $486MM USD equivalent in OCEAN + datatokens combined\n* [Launching $OceanO stablecoin backed by $OCEAN token ](https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2021/01/Ocean-teams-up-with-OpenDao-Protocol)in 3-4 weeks (via OpenDAO and UMA protocol)\n* In Bancor, OCEAN/BNT pool has about $13MM USD in liquidity and is one of the top 10 pools\n* In Uniswap, OCEAN/ETH pool has about $3.6MM USD in liquidity and more than $1.5 MM USD in daily volume\n* Ocean Token page in coingecko has > 25k likes\n* As per etherscan, there are > 25k OCEAN token holders\n\n## The Future: Collateralizing Data Assets with CREAM <> Ocean Protocol\n\nBesides developing an OCEAN lending market, there are other more interesting initiatives that we’re excited to develop with the CREAM community. As of today, Ocean Protocol has over $850k TVL in our datatoken pools.\n\nOur datatokens are ERC20 tokens and each of them are underlying assets of their own data market. We see a vivid future where each of these datatokens can have their own lending market on CREAM. This will be groundbreaking for both Ocean and CREAM and help CREAM become the first lending protocol that collateralized real world data with efficiency and scale.\n\nOther collaborations that might be interesting for the Cream community is to source curated data from Ocean Protocol marketplaces to be able optimise the lending rates and possibly provide under-collateralized loans. CREAM community may also choose to monetise the data Cream platform generates to fund the platform and to incentivize users using the platform.\n\nThere are multiple collaborations that both Ocean and Cream communities can work out. I hope the CREAM community sees OCEAN as a good fit and potential long term collaboration partner.\n\n## Proposal\n\nI would appreciate it if someone would make a proposal to list $OCEAN on the CREAM platform.\n\n**For:** \n> List OCEAN as collateral\n\n**Against:** \n>Do nothing\n\n### =====contents above are drafted by innoprenuer=====\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/add-ocean-ocean-protocol-as-a-collateral-asset-to-cream-market/791",

We believe these qualities make RAI ideal initially as an alternative to pegged-coins for use in DeFi as collateral and as a stable reserve asset, especially for programs where resilience is critical.\n\nWe just [announced our launch](https://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1362070552437919746) ~2 hours ago, and there is already [$7.5M in liquidity](https://info.uniswap.org/token/0x03ab458634910aad20ef5f1c8ee96f1d6ac54919)!\n\n**For**\nAdd RAI to Cream for lending & borrowing. \n\n**Against**\nDo nothing\n\n## Motivation\n\nRAI: 0x03ab458634910AaD20eF5f1C8ee96F1D6ac54919\n\nCream is the leading lending platform for the long-tail of DeFi assets, often being first to list innovative new assets. In the case of RAI, maintaining system stability is greatly assisted by having a leverage facility to balance ETH/RAI longs. By depositing RAI as collateral in Cream, borrowing ETH, and selling for more RAI, traders would be able to go long on RAI/ETH and help correct short-term RAI price dips. As such, Cream could be instrumental to helping RAI establish itself as a new independent stable reserve asset for DeFi, and the Cream community could earn fees from our activity along the way :) .\n\n=====Contents above are drafted by ameensol=====\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/list-rai-and-possibly-eth-rai-lp-as-collateral-asset/876",

Alpha products focus on capturing unaddressed demand in DeFi in an innovative and user-friendly way.\n\n**Key facts:**\n\n* ALPHA is a governance token for Alpha Finance Labs ecosystem and portfolio of products - token holders can vote on the opened proposals for key product metrics.\n* First product from the portfolio is Alpha Homora - a protocol that enables leveraged yield farming. It captured $1 billion of TVL within 4 months since it’s launch in October 2020, bringing Alpha Homora to top 10 of DeFi Pulse (at the time of writing #9) .\n* Upcoming products include AlphaX, a decentralized, non-orderbook perpetual trading platform with tokenized positions and funding rate baked into the price of the asset.\n\nAlpha Finance CEO, Tascha Punyaneramitdee has an extensive worldwide banking background with a vision to reform traditional finance in a decentralized manner. Also former Head of Strategy for Band Protocol. Alpha team commitment is to grow the whole DeFi sector by building innovative products including Alpha Homora v2 that is strategically integrated with CREAM V2 by the first-seen implementation of protocol-to-protocol lending.\n\n**MOTIVATION & BENEFITS**\n\nALPHA is not listed as collateral on any platforms so far, yet it’s liquidity pools with ETH tend to be highlighted as trending on many AMM’s. By outstanding achievements, Alpha attracted the attention of the whole DeFi space including the recent announcement of Delphi Digital investing in the project. Other investors include The Spartan Group, Multicoin Capital, DeFiance Capital.\n\n**Benefits for CREAM:**\n\n* Increased TVL for Cream: Listing ALPHA token as the primary place would bring a flow of TVL in form of Alpha tokens as collateral to borrow against it (current market cap according to CoinGecko is $558m)\n* Increased brand-awareness: Alpha Team is already collaborating with CREAM, borrowing liquidity for it’s leveraged positions in Alpha Homora v2. Listing Alpha as collateral would cause a stream of marketing activities that will bring new users to CREAM - 6000 members of Telegram Group and 33k of twitter followers.\n* Access to Alpha token holders: 7500 holders + over 20k users participated Binance Launchpad\n\n**TOKEN**\n\n* Symbol: ALPHA\n* Blockchain Type: ERC20, BEP20\n* Role of Token: Utility\n\n**EXCHANGES**\n\nALPHA is listed on a number of popular exchanges (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/alpha-finance#markets) including Binance (margin enabled, futures enabled).\n\nDaily trading volume averages to $7.22 billion over the last 3 months according to CoinGecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/alpha-finance/historical_data/usd?end_date=2021-02-06&start_date=2020-11-06#panel).\n\n=====contents above are drafted by Tomkop=====\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-list-alpha-as-collateral-asset/783",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nWe propose to add $RUNE to CREAM for lending and borrowing.\n\n## THORChain\n\n[THORChain](https://thorchain.org/) is a cross-chain Uniswap and decentralized liquidity network based on Tendermint& Cosmos-SDK and utilizing Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS) to create a marketplace of liquidity for digital assets to be traded in a trustless, permissionless & non-custodial manner.\n\nTHORChain has launched a single chain chaosnet that currently supports the Bitcoin blockchain and soon ERC-20 assets. At the same time, THORChain communities are working on [Cosmos (ATOM) 、Polkadot 、Zilliqa、Monero/Haven、BitcoinCash and Solana.](https://twitter.com/thorchain_org/status/1333663042173763584)\n\n## $RUNE\n\n$RUNE is the governance token of THORChain. The function of $RUNE in the Thorchain network is as the settlement asset that secures the network through the token economy. $RUNE is also used as an incentive to reward liquidity providers and subsidize gas. $RUNE was one of the best performing exchange tokens in 2020, and gained more than 3000% last year.\n\nTHORChain recently released ERC-20 $RUNE in addition to the BEP version of the token. Since launching the ERC-20 version of $RUNE in mid-January, liquidity on Sushiswap has already passed US$15M.\n\n## Benefits for CREAM\n\nBEPSwap is the cross-chain DEX powered by THORCHAIN built on the Binance Chain - THORChain plans to replace this with their cross-chain dex ASGARD - this will help the CREAM ecosystem bridge ERC20 and BEP assets.\n\nTHORChain is included in CREAM partner’s Sushiswap’s 2021 roadmap as the ideal partner for Sushiswap’s crosschain DEX integration. There are also numerous token pairs in the Yearn ecosystem that could benefit from crosschain options.\n\nWith so many incredible developments from $RUNE and the huge potential market of cross-chain DEXes, we predict that $RUNE will be the next blue chip DeFi asset. This will bring more TVL to CREAM over time.\n\n#### Action Item\n\n**For**: Add $RUNE to CREAM.\n\n**Against**: Do nothing.\n\n(ERC) $RUNE Contract Address: 0x3155ba85d5f96b2d030a4966af206230e46849cb\n\n=====contents above are drafted by MagicRabbi=====\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/list-rune-as-collateral-asset/777",

      "title": "List bBADGER as Collateral Asset",
      "content": "Summary\nProposal to add $bBadger to CREAM for lending and borrowing.\n\nBadgerDAO went live on December 3, 2020. Badger is a governance token for the DAO while bBADGER is the token that represents one’s position in the Badger Sett. bBADGER is indicative of a user’s partial ownership of the assets within the vault.\n\nCurrently, the TVL across all Setts is ~ $1,000,000,000 (https://app.badger.finance/ 15)\n\nShould this proposal be accepted, CREAM would be the first lending protocol to accept bBADGER tokens.\n\nWhat Is Badger?\n\nBadger is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on building the products and infrastructure necessary to accelerate Bitcoin as collateral across other blockchains. Specifically, it is an ecosystem DAO where projects and people from across DeFi can come together to collaborate and build the products DeFi needs. Shared ownership in the DAO incentivizes builders to have aligned objectives while decentralized governance ensures that those incentives remain fair to all parties and that the projects pursued are determined by the community. Badger is, first and foremost, a community-led initiative that prioritizes collaboration over competition and operates on fairness, transparency, and high collective engagement.\n\nBadger’s first of two products are Sett, an automated DeFi aggregator focused on tokenized BTC assets, and DIGG, a non-custodial synthetic Bitcoin on Ethereum. Sett was launched on December 3, 2020, Digg successfully launched on January 22, 2021\n\nHow do the Sett vaults work?\n\nUser goes to app.badger.finance and deposits $BADGER\nUser receives $bBADGER that represents their share of $BADGER staked in the Sett\n$bBADGER is yield bearing and the rewards earned will be auto compounded for the user soon, outlined in BIP 24 (https://forum.badger.finance/t/bip-24-badger-boost-multiplier-replacement/1914 25)\nUser’s can at anytime unstake and claim their share of the $BADGER in the Sett\nBenefits for CREAM\n\nAccess to Badger’s User Base: Badger brings along with it a vibrant community of 6,000 holders and 6,000+ community members, known as Badgers, on Discord.\n\nIncreased TVL for Cream: This proposal will allow the CREAM TVL to expand and will allow the Badger community to borrow other Assets against their $bBADGER tokens.\n\nAt the time of writing, the Badger Sett has 3,467,679 $BADGER tokens in the vault earning 126% APY. These tokens represent ~ $86,484,000 in TVL.\n\nThe price for $bBADGER is determined by price of badger * PricePerFullShare() of the bBADGER contract.\n\nAction Item\n\nFor: Add $bBADGER to CREAM.\n\nAgainst: Do nothing.\n\nbBadger Contract Address: 0x19d97d8fa813ee2f51ad4b4e04ea08baf4dffc28\n\nbDIGG Contract Address: 0x798d1be841a82a273720ce31c822c61a67a601c3",

      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis is a revision of the previously [unsuccessful proposal](https://vote.cream.finance/#/cream-finance.eth/proposal/QmYA68naWF2SYJ6YhDuGfh3b9az9F9eGeb8btrHebBixZv) submitted by @eason on 17 January 2021. The proposal was initially discussed via [community forum](https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-add-amp-as-a-collateral-asset/387), resulting in very high engagement levels (664 views, 41 replies, 160 likes). This re-submission is based on community feedback (specifically SLP and crCREAM holders) who are eligible to vote due to recent Cream voting power updates.\n\nSince AMP is a collateral token by design, it will disproportionately increase TVL to the Cream platform. Additionally, this integration can potentially enable various payments functionality within the greater Flexa network and Cream ecosystem partners and initiatives (e.g., Iron Bank).\n\n## AMP Overview\n\nAMP is a collateral token (ERC-20 compatible) that was co-developed by Flexa and [Consensys](https://consensys.net). Currently its primary use is securing the entirety of the [Flexa payment network](http://flexa.network) ([\\$140M TVL](https://www.defipulse.com/flexa)). AMP is staked as collateral for wallet projects in the [Flexa Capacity](https://app.flexa.network) contract, enabling real-time digital payments at merchants. All network proceeds are used to repurchase AMP, distributed as rewards to collateral providers. AMP is open-source and includes a novel [collateral partition strategy](https://amptoken.org/whitepaper.pdf) that allows it to collateralize value transfer without requiring tokens to be moved into staking contracts. Note, AMP was formerly Flexacoin (FXC) but there was a 1:1 swap of the tokens in Sep 2020 to upgrade the partition functionality.\n\n## AMP token and collateral contract audits\n\nTrail of Bits ([August 2020](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/amp.pdf))\nConsensys Diligence ([June 2020](https://consensys.net/diligence/audits/2020/06/amp/))\n\n## Token metrics (January 2021)\n\nCirculating supply: 34.8B (100B total)\nDaily trading volume: \\$1M (Gemini, Bittrex, Poloniex)\nDEX liquidity: Uniswap, Balancer, Moonswap, Sushiswap\n\n## Technical resources\n\nAMP whitepaper: [https://amptoken.org/whitepaper.pdf](https://amptoken.org/whitepaper.pdf)\nAMP token contract: [0xff20817765cb7f73d4bde2e66e067e58d11095c2](https://etherscan.io/address/0xff20817765cb7f73d4bde2e66e067e58d11095c2)\nFlexa staking contract address: [0x706d7f8b3445d8dfc790c524e3990ef014e7c578](https://etherscan.io/address/0x706d7f8b3445d8dfc790c524e3990ef014e7c578)\nFlexa staking contract website: [https://app.flexa.network/](https://app.flexa.network/)\nFlexa whitepaper: [https://flexa.network/whitepaper.pdf](https://flexa.network/whitepaper.pdf)\n\n## Flexa/AMP Article features\n\n[CBS News: Global payments network Flexa launches to accept cryptocurrency payments](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/who-accepts-cryptocurrency-whole-foods-bed-bath-beyond-and-ulta-among-retailers-accepting-cryptocurrency/)\n[Forbes: Customers Can Spend Bitcoin At Starbucks, Nordstrom And Whole Foods](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2019/05/13/starbucks-nordstrom-and-whole-foods-now-accept-bitcoin-just-dont-ask-them/?sh=2127569e2252)\n[Fortune: Bitcoin Comes to Whole Foods, Major Retailers in Coup for Digital Currency](https://fortune.com/2019/05/13/bitcoin-comes-to-whole-foods-major-retailers-in-coup-for-digital-currency/)\n[CNET: Startup Flexa's cryptocurrency payment network get big names](https://www.cnet.com/news/flexa-cryptocurrency-system-lets-you-buy-coffee-jamba-juice-whole-foods-office-depot/)\n[MIT Technology Review: You can now pay with cryptocurrency](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/05/14/135388/you-can-now-pay-with-cryptocurrency-at-whole-foods/)\n[NASDAQ: Flexa Enables BTC Payments at Popular Brick-and-Mortar Stores](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/flexa-enables-btc-payments-popular-brick-and-mortar-stores-2019-05-13)\n\n[Coindesk: Crypto “Stripe” Flexa Raises \\$14M](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-stripe-flexa-raises-14-million-so-you-can-buy-coffee-with-bitcoin)\n[Coindesk: You Can Now ‘Spedn’ Bitcoin at GameStop, Barnes & Noble and More](https://www.coindesk.com/you-can-now-spedn-bitcoin-at-gamestop-barnes-noble-and-more)\n[Coindesk: New Flexa Tech Will Let You Spend Bitcoin From Other Apps Too](https://www.coindesk.com/new-flexa-tech-will-let-you-spend-bitcoin-from-other-apps-too)\n[Coindesk: Mall of America to Showcase Winklevoss-Backed Crypto Payments](https://www.coindesk.com/mall-of-america-to-showcase-winklevoss-backed-crypto-payments)\n[Coindesk: Robot Ventures, Others Back ‘Crypto Stripe’ Flexa in \\$6M Raise](https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-payment-app-flexa-raises-6m-unveils-new-backend)\n[Fundstrat: Flexa: On a mission to make digital assets universally spendable](https://fsinsight.com/2020/11/03/crypto-special-report-flexa-on-a-mission-to-make-d/)\n[TheBlock: Gemini and Flexa team up to deliver cryptocurrency payments](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/23145/gemini-and-flexa-team-up-to-deliver-cryptocurrency-payments)\n[Cointelegraph: Flexa Launches App Where Shoppers Can Spend Crypto at Major US Retailers](https://cointelegraph.com/news/flexa-launches-app-where-shoppers-can-spend-crypto-at-15-major-us-retailers)\n\n[Medium: AMP the new digital collateral token](https://medium.com/amptoken/amp-the-new-digital-collateral-token-524bc568af92)\n\n## Social Resources\n\nAMP Website: [https://amptoken.org/](https://amptoken.org/)\nAMP Blog: [https://medium.com/amptoken](https://medium.com/amptoken)\nAMP Telegram: [https://t.me/ampchat](https://t.me/ampchat)\nAMP Twitter: [https://twitter.com/amptoken](https://twitter.com/amptoken)\nAMP/Flexa Discord: [https://discord.gg/T4EY6yx](https://discord.gg/T4EY6yx)\nFlexa Website: [https://flexa.network/](https://flexa.network/)\nFlexa Blog: [https://medium.com/flexa](https://medium.com/flexa)\nFlexa Twitter: [https://twitter.com/flexahq](https://twitter.com/flexahq)\n",

      "content": "**Summary** :\nAdd xSushi to CREAM for Borrow and Lend\n\n**SUSHI**\n\nxSUSHI is the governance token of Sushiswap, a community-led DEX with a current TVL of more than US$1.9 billion.\n\nxSushi is one of the two currently supported assets for Sushi governance (ETH/SUSHI SLP is the other). Sushi governance is not currently fully decentralized, but the members of the Ops multisig and Treasury multisig are expected to respect all of the governance votes. Sushi is planning for xSushi to eventually become a fully decentralized DAO most likely leveraging Aragon v2 in 6 to 12 months depending on the progress made by its community.\n\nxSushi is receiving 0.05% of all the Sushiswap swaps and should also benefit from all other future revenues streams from new platforms like Bento, Miso, Gusoku, Deriswap, and more.\n\nThe current yield on this asset ranges between 10-40% APY with over US$450 million locked (at today's $Sushi price) in the Sushibar making xSushi an ideal productive asset for collateral.\n\nSome additional data points can be found here:\n\n* [https://sushiswapanalytics.com/bar ](https://sushiswapanalytics.com/bar)\n* [https://sushi.zippo.io/sushibar ](https://sushi.zippo.io/sushibar)\n\nSushiswap's other token, $SUSHI is already supported on CREAM with a 60% collateral factor.\n\nGiven the short existence of SUSHI on the market and the volatility, we think these parameters should be considered (and voted on in a subsequent vote per CREAM new asset procedure that mandates all new assets begin with 0% collateral factor):\n\nCollateral Factor - 40% \nReserve Factor - 20% \n\nWe hope you will support this proposal\n\n**Useful Links** :\nOfficial:\n[https://sushiswap.fi/ ](https://sushiswap.fi/)\n[https://lite.sushiswap.fi/ ](https://lite.sushiswap.fi/)\nSushi token : 0x6b3595068778dd592e39a122f4f5a5cf09c90fe2\nxSushi token : 0x8798249c2E607446EfB7Ad49eC89dD1865Ff4272\n\nSushi Governance forum: forum.sushiswapclassic. org\nHelp and FAQ: docs.sushiswap. fi\n\n**Audits/Security Reviews** :\n\n[Peckshield & Quantstamp ](https://docs.defisafety.com/finished-reviews/sushiswap-process-quality-audit#audits)\n\n**Benefits for CREAM:**\n\nCREAM would be one of the first platforms to support xSushi a yield-bearing asset with over US$450 million currently sitting idle.\n\nCREAM users could borrow against their existing xSushi.\n\nThis enhances the overall composability and value of the Yearn ecosystem. \n\nSupport community-led projects.\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n\nSushiswap has been audited 2 times and is a community-led project.\n\nThe protocol currently has more than 26,100 Sushi guests.\n\nWhile Sushi had one exploit that led to the incorrect distribution of rewards to xSushi holders, that issue was mitigated in 5 hours after discovery with only US$15,000 in lost profits. These lost profits were reimbursed directly by Sushi's treasury, so that no holders lost any assets.\n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\n=====contents above are drafted by AlienWatts=====\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/add-xsushi-for-borrow-and-lend/588",

      "title": "List MIC as Collateral Asset",
      "content": "## Summary \n\n>Mithril Cash aims to become the de-facto standard for algorithmic stablecoins in DeFi. It is a fork of the Basis Cash protocol, which we believe to be the most robust design in the space. The project has been well received by the market, with over $1.4B in TVL in the first 24 hours after launch.\n\n**For**: List MIC as a collateral asset\n**Against**: Do nothing\n \n## Motivation\n\n**Abstract**\nThe Mithril Cash protocol controls money supply similarly to how central banks of the world may guide the value of fiat money through monetary policy. By controlling the quantity of money supply in an economy by minting fresh currency or selling bonds, a target value can be achieved (In this case $1). Instead of a central bank or a currency board, rules are set and executed programmatically via smart contracts so that behavior of the system can be predictable.\n\nEvery 24 hours, the TWAP of the MIC price from the MIC-USDT Sushiswap pool is used to determine if the MIC supply needs to be expanded or contracted. The stabilization threshold is currently set to 1.01 MIC/USDT.\n\nIf TWAP > 1.01, expansionary policy is applied and new MIC is minted using the formula circulatingSupply *(oraclePrice-1)\n\nIf TWAP < 1.01, contractionary policy is applied. Mithril Bonds are made available for purchase at an algorithmically set price. With a Mithril Cash oracle price of P USDT, bonds are sold off at a price of P MIC (effective price being P^2 USDT), promising bond holders a premium when redeemed. Purchased bonds can be converted to Mithril Cash at a 1:1 rate, insofar as the preconditions are met and the Treasury is not empty.\n\n**Benefits to CREAM**\n• As the first major DeFi protocol to integrate MIC, CREAM would be well positioned to capture additional TVL as our circulating supply grows\n• Potential for further synergies down the line. Leveraged strategies could be built atop the MITH protocol\n\n**Milestones**\n• Sushiswap trading volume on Day 1: $96M\n• Currently ranked 5 and 6 on Sushiswap\n• TVL: $1.4B within 24 hours of launch.\n• Decentralized: 3x the number of holders as comparables\n• Partnerships: QCP Capital\n\n**Resources**\nMain\n• Website: https://mith.cash/\n• Docs: https://sauron.gitbook.io/mith-cash/\n• Guide: https://mithcash.medium.com/overall-guide-of-mith-cash-for-beginners-en-zh-1325423d155a\n• Github: https://github.com/mithio\n• Dune Analytics: https://duneanalytics.com/0xBoxer/mith-cash\n• Yield Farming Tool: https://mith-cash-tool.web.app/mithcash/\n\nSocial / Community\n• Discord link: https://discord.gg/EacqCKujT7\n• Telegram: https://t.co/cy1BNDWwGJ?amp=1\n• Twitter: https://twitter.com/mithcash\n• Medium: https://mithcash.medium.com/\n\n==========\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/list-mic-as-collateral-asset/537",

      "content": "Proposal to list OGN as an asset available for supplying and borrowing\n\nFor: List OGN\nAgainst: Do nothing\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nOGN is the governance and ecosystem token for Origin Protocol and Origin Dollar (OUSD). Origin Protocol is a protocol for peer to peer commerce and has released a suite of commerce products including Dshop 4 and the Origin Marketplace. OUSD 1 is a yield-aggregating rebasing stablecoin backed by USDT, USDC, and DAI designed to be a currency that further powers peer-to-peer transactions. It is a stablecoin and serves as a medium of exchange and unit of account while also earning yield for buyers and sellers that use it as a means of transaction. OUSD suffered a hack shortly after launch but has successfully relaunched after multiple completed security audits. The Origin team stands by their products and has committed to compensating affected OUSD users, which is unusual in DeFi.\n\nOGN was previously listed on Harvest as a staking asset via popular vote. OUSD was listed on SushiSwap for LP rewards and SnowSwap for staking rewards.\n\nMOTIVATION\n\nOGN has a very large and established community (over 500k members) as well as a diverse investor base. Investors include Steve Chen (founder, YouTube), Alexis Ohanian (founder, Reddit), Garry Tan (partner, Y Combinator), Justin Blau (DJ 3LAU), Foundation Capital, Pantera Capital, Blockchain.com, and KBW Ventures (headed by Saudi Prince Khaled bin Alwaleed). Adding OGN as a collateral asset on Cream will join the two communities and encourage OGN holders to become Cream users and CREAM holders. The Origin team has committed to publicly marketing and promoting the Cream suite of products.\n\nSPECIFICATION\n\nStandard ERC-20 token.\nMetrics available on the OGN Token Dashboard\n0x8207c1ffc5b6804f6024322ccf34f29c3541ae26\nEXCHANGES\n\nOGN is listed on Binance (margin enabled), Huobi (margin enabled), Bittrex, Upbit, and many other exchanges. Daily trading volume averages to $12,716,228 over the last 6 months according to Coinmarketcap. OGN currently has > $400k liquidity on Uniswap.\n\nAUDITS\n\nOrigin Token (OGN) was included in a Nov 2018 audit by Trail of Bits 3.\n\nLINKS\n\nOrigin Website: https://www.originprotocol.com 1\nOrigin Dollar: https://www.ousd.com\nBlog: https://medium.com/originprotocol\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/originprotocol\nTelegram: https://t.me/originprotocol\nDiscord: https://www.originprotocol.com/discord\n\nForum Discussion: https://forum.cream.finance/t/list-origin-protocol-ogn-as-a-collateral-asset/439",

      "content": "## Summary \n\nUse the 1.39M creamY rescue funds in protocol development and improvements.\n\n**For**: Use 1.39M funds in C.R.E.A.M. Finance protocol development and incentivize $CREAM / $USDC pool on SushiSwap\n\n**Against**: Do nothing\n \n## Background\n\nTwo weeks back, we rescued $1.39 million liquidity locked in the creamY Swap pools. Of the $1.39 million, a significant portion was from fees generated by creamY Swap. However, as we began to unwind the funds we realized some portion was the result of an issue with the creamY oracle that returned the wrong price of cyUSD. Specifically, the oracle should have returned the actual price of cyUSD (total value / total supply), but instead returned a constant value of 1e18.\n\nAs a result, every user who previously provided liquidity to creamY Swap withdrew less than would have been returned were the oracle functioning properly. The good news is that these losses were slightly offset by the $CREAM rewards distributed to creamY Swap LPs.\n\nWe have rescued these funds ([here is the transaction on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x669a1774e2740178d80f30b0cc650c6d7f13e6d5d54180daa51eb085e117c5c5)) and redistributed them to CREAM’s multisig contract. We are submitting a proposal to C.R.E.A.M. DAO that recommends we utilize these funds for the following:\n\n1. $1 million treasury assets will be utilized for ongoing protocol development. The CREAM team will submit an annual budget to our governance platform for the approval of the CREAM community.\n2. $390,000 will be allocated to an incentivized $CREAM / $USDC pool on SushiSwap. This pool will serve to “buy and make” $CREAM tokens. This will make CREAM the first protocol to execute on [Joel Monegro’s vision to utilize buybacks for market-making rather than burning tokens](https://www.placeholder.vc/blog/2020/9/17/stop-burning-tokens-buyback-and-make-instead).\n\nThe “buyback and burn” model is well known in crypto. However, once tokens are burned, they essentially destroy value for existing token-holders since these tokens could otherwise have been used to finance future development and growth. Tokens are capital assets that can be reused after they are bought back. One potential use case is to issue $CREAM from the treasury to incentivize future partnerships and other important community activity.\n\nWhile we believe this is the best path forward for the rescued funds, we understand the importance of community governance and will submit a proposal along with this post to be voted on in the coming week.\n\n==========\n\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/the-use-of-1-39m-creamy-rescue-funds/380",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nWe propose to add KEEP to CREAM for lending and borrowing. \n\nKEEP is the work token of the Keep Network, used for staking and work allocation in the network. The first main project of the Keep Network is TBTC, a decentralized version of Bitcoin in Ethereum. TBTC has already been voted as a collateral in CREAM, and will be added in the coming weeks to CREAM, see vote [here](https://vote.cream.finance/#/cream/proposal/QmPiVqdEXUKguQPiTgefE6S4A4KqoYBfM7q5v9hrZVMm23) \n\n**For**: List KEEP as collateral asset\n**Against**: Do nothing\n\n## Background\n\n**Details about KEEP**\n\nKEEP is required to run Nodes that mint, redeem and secure TBTC. It will also be used for future applications of the Keep Network, in addition to the live project TBTC.\nKEEP is called a work token, because it is required for staking in the network nodes; a higher amount staked increases the chances of the Node to be selected for work, as well as the amount of rewards assigned to that Node for work executed.\n\n\n**Example of Use Case for KEEP Token as Collateral**\nA user (Lender) has KEEP tokens (earned through the Liquidity Mining Program of the KEEP Network, or bought on the market) but does not want to operate a Node in the KEEP Network. \nShe could lend those KEEP tokens in CREAM for an Operator to borrow; this would increase the Operator’s chances of being selected and the amount of Rewards earned for being assigned work. The operator could secure this loan with their TBTC (recently approved in CREAM). \n\nA **Win-Win-Win** situation: \n* Owner of KEEP earns interest by lending it\n* Node Operator earns bigger rewards in the Keep Network staking the borrowed KEEP\n* CREAM earns the spread on the Borrow/Lend interests\n\n\n**Current Liquidity and Availability**\n* Summary of Keep Token Statistics:\n(Please check the image in the [discussion thread](https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-add-keep-as-collateral-asset/328))\n\n* KEEP Staked in KEEP Network: In this Site you can see the current Operators of the KEEP Network and the amount of KEEP staked for each Node. https://allthekeeps.com/operators \n* KEEP token in Etherscan: https://etherscan.io/token/0x85eee30c52b0b379b046fb0f85f4f3dc3009afec \n\n\n## References\n\nKEEP Token Description:[ https://blog.keep.network/how-the-keep-token-works-500c9722dac0)\n\nKeep Network, TBTC and KEEP Token documentation: https://keepdocs.github.io/#/ \n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/nPwebdFEGN\n\nTwitter:[ https://twitter.com/keep_project](https://twitter.com/keep_project)\n\n==contents above are drafted by @ramaruro and @Estebank==\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-add-keep-as-collateral-asset/328",

Finance under quite low risk, for 1INCH is issued by one of the biggest DEX 1inch. By listing 1INCH, users of C.R.E.A.M. Finance are enable to leverage it.\n\nEven 1INCH is a relatively new token, its market cap and trade volume are still huge, which would makes it easy for liquidators to liquidate and sell, mitigating the risk of the lending protocol.\n\nThus, for the greater good of the protocol, we should list 1INCH and enable it for leveraging\n\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/list-1inch-as-collateral-asset/325",

      "title": "List ESD as Collateral Asset",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nEmpty Set Dollar (ESD) has been one of the fastest growing algorithmic stablecoins launched to date. Its market capitalization has grown to nearly $200 million in the 3.5 months since its inception. As the market capitalization has increased, so too has the number of unique addresses holding ESD, the liquidity of the asset, and the avg. daily trading volume.\n\nThe unique mechanism design of the Empty Set Dollar protocol makes it a strong candidate to become one of the largest stable collateral assets in the decentralized finance ecosystem.\n\nIn spite of its large & growing community and adoption, unlike other stable assets like USDC, USDT, and DAI, ESD is not yet listed as collateral on any decentralized money market protocols. In order to grow their TVL and generate more usage + to improve the overall effectiveness of the DeFi ecosystem, C.R.E.A.M. should add supply and borrow for ESD. \n\n**For**: List ESD as collateral asset\n**Against**: Do nothing\n\n## Abstract\n\nEmpty Set Dollar (ESD) is an algorithmic, seigniorage-based stablecoin that utilizes fixed protocol rules on supply expansion as well as a unique coupon creation + redemption model to incentivize trustless coordination between selfish participants that maintain ESD’s synthetic peg 1:1 with the US dollar all on-chain. Unlike other algorithmic stable coins like AMPL, ESD does not rebase all balances using non-standard functions, but instead adjusts supply through other mechanisms, allowing ESD to have the same composability as other standard ERC20 tokens.\n\nCurrently, crypto lacks a truly decentralized and censorship-resistant stablecoin. While DAI and sUSD come close, they currently have vulnerabilities in their architecture. The goal of ESD is to create a truly permissionless, scaleable, stable store of value, that can be used as superfluid collateral in DeFi.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nTotal Uniswap Liquidity as of 12/14/2020: $76.3 million\n\n24 Hour Trading volume: $13.9 million\n\n## Token Holder Distribution\n\nAs of 12/14/2020 there are currently over 446 unique addresses holding ESD; however, this does not calculate the large # of addresses currently staked in the DAO / LP \n\nCheck out: www.esd.tools for more network statistics\n\n## Motivation\n\nESD has one of the most active and rapidly growing communities of any stablecoin in the market, yet is underrepresented relative to it's market capitalization on existing DeFi protocols like CREAM. Adding ESD to CREAM will likely expand the platform TVL. \n\nIt would also benefit the ESD community by increasing offering the ability for speculators to take a short position in the asset, thus creating a new mechanism to stabilize the price of the ESD token when its TWAP sits above the $1 target. Finally, accelerating the growth of ESD would enhance the antifragility of the entire DeFi ecosystem due to ESD’s unique characteristics relative to other stable assets.\n\n## Primary Resources on ESD\n\n- Whitepaper: [https://github.com/emptysetsquad/dollar/blob/master/døllar.pdf ](https://github.com/emptysetsquad/dollar/blob/master/d%C3%B8llar.pdf)\n\n* Website: [https://emptyset.finance/#/ ](https://emptyset.finance/#/)\n* Twitter: [https://twitter.com/emptysetsquad ](https://twitter.com/emptysetsquad)\n* Source Code: [https://github.com/emptysetsquad/dollar ](https://github.com/emptysetsquad/dollar)\n* ESD token contract: [https://etherscan.io/token/0x36f3fd68e7325a35eb768f1aedaae9ea0689d723 ](https://etherscan.io/token/0x36f3fd68e7325a35eb768f1aedaae9ea0689d723)\n* EIPs: [https://www.emptyset.xyz/t/eip-1-improvements-to-esd-coupon-redemption/32 ](https://www.emptyset.xyz/t/eip-1-improvements-to-esd-coupon-redemption/32)\n* Medium: [https://medium.com/@emptysetsquad ](https://medium.com/@emptysetsquad)\n* Discord: [https://discord.com/invite/vPws9Vp ](https://discord.com/invite/vPws9Vp)\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n* [https://medium.com/@lewisfreiberg/empty-set-dollar-esd-a0abbfc5ecdb ](https://medium.com/@lewisfreiberg/empty-set-dollar-esd-a0abbfc5ecdb)\n* [O’ligopoly Productions Writeup ](https://soligo.substack.com/p/the-empty-set-dollar-premium-superfluid?r=9bqlu&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&utm_source=twitter)\n* [Defi Weekly Writeup ](https://defiweekly.substack.com/p/empty-set-dollar-a-new-elastic-stable) by Kerman Kohli\n* [esd.tools ](http://esd.tools/) (dashboard for tracking the state of the network)\n* [https://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/empty-set-dollar ](https://explore.duneanalytics.com/dashboard/empty-set-dollar)\n* [https://medium.com/@scott_lew_is/a-vision-for-empty-set-dollar-ce29b7e0e297 ](https://medium.com/@scott_lew_is/a-vision-for-empty-set-dollar-ce29b7e0e297)\n\n=====contents above are drafted by AlienWatts=====\nDiscussion Link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-list-empty-set-dollar-esd-as-a-collateral-asset/297",

      "content": "Joint Proposal by @ramaruro, @benlongstaff and EstebanK\n\n## Summary\n\nWe propose to add TBTC to CREAM for lending and borrowing.\n\nTBTC is a fully Bitcoin-backed ERC-20 token pegged to the price of Bitcoin. TBTC release candidate 1 went live in September 2020 and currently has $32M in TBTC locked.\n\n**For**: List TBTC as collateral asset\n**Against**: Do nothing\n\n## Benefits for CREAM\n\n**New user base**: Each Bitcoin on Ethereum project brings with it a community who resonate with the projects values. This proposal will allow the CREAM TVL to expand, and the TBTC community to borrow other Assets against their TBTC.\n\n**Additional strategies**: As CREAM starts to collaborate with the Yearn Ecosystem  there might be additional opportunities to use TBTC through CREAM.\n\n**Diversity of choice for BTC based Collateral**:\nCurrently CREAM supports:\n- HBTC (Huobi BTC) \n- BBTC (Binance Wrapped BTC) \n- RenBTC \n\nTBTC offers an alternative that has been fully decentralised from launch.\n\n## Benefits for the general DeFi Community\n\nBring Optionality to the DeFi Community with a decentralized Bitcoin Exposure.\n\nDecentralized Assets are essential for DeFi to stay “Decentralized”. It is important to keep that prospective in mind as a lot of liquidity based on Centralized Assets has flown into the DeFi Ecosystem.\n\n## Details about TBTC\n\nThe tBTC system is developed by the Keep Network.\n\ntBTC is\n\n* Decentralized\n* Trustless\n* Permissionless\n* Fully collateralized\n* Open Source\n* Audited\n\nEach bitcoin deposit is stored in a separate wallet created by the signers. The protocol has strong economic security measures. Depositors don’t have to trust custodians, aka signers, because signers deposit an ETH bond higher than the value of the BTC they hold in custody.\n\nIn the event that signers colluded to steal BTC the network would seize their ETH bond (150% of the BTC they have signed for) and slash their KEEP stake by the minimum stake amount (currently 70,000 KEEP).\n\nThe permissionless nature can be summed up by:\n\nQuestion - “How many doors would you have to kick down to stop my TBTC being redeemed for BTC?”\nAnswer - “Good luck finding the doors”\n\n## Current Liquidity and Availability\n\n**TBTC Statistics:**\n\nThis site shows current Supply of TBTC, total Value Locked, Mints and Redeems, as well as Bonded Value (securing the TBTC) (https://keepstats.org/)\n\nPools available in Curve, Uniswap, and Balancer\n\nCurrently there are Rewards Incentives for holding TBTC Curve Pool: the LP token can then be deposited in Harvest and BadgerDAO.\n\n=====Contents above are drafted by ramaruro=====\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-add-tbtc-as-collateral-asset/264",

      "content": "A proposal by BoringDAO community, Contact us: info@boringdao.com\n\n## Summary\n\nList oBTC as the collateral asset.\n\n**For** : List oBTC as a collateral asset\n**Against** : Do nothing\n\n## Background\n\nLaunched by: BoringDAO\n\nBacked by: oBTC is backed by BTC in 1:1 ratio\n\nSmart Contract:\n\noBTC\n> 0x8064d9ae6cdf087b1bcd5bdf3531bd5d8c537a68\n\nBTC P2SH multi-signature contract:\n\nBTC\n> 33ZibwpiZe4bM5pwpAdQNqqs2RthLkpJer\n\nAudited by: [PeckShield](https://github.com/BoringDAO/boringDAO-contract/blob/master/peckshield-audit-report-boringdao-v1.0rc.pdf)\n\noBTC is an ERC-20 token issued by BoringDAO representing a 1-to-1 peg to actual Bitcoin, which can be minted or redeemed by anyone. It is built to unlock the productive value of Bitcoin on the Ethereum network and bring additional collateral to DeFi. Unlike other wrapped versions of Bitcoin, oBTC adopts a triple pledged mechanism (Underlying Bitcoin + Pledged Collaterals + Insurance) that maximizes its safety. What it means is that any oBTC is backed by at least 150% collateralized asset + insurance.\n\nFor the securitization of the underlying Bitcoin, we are using a multi-sig wallet that is controlled by the community. On the smart contract layer,  oBTC tunnel operators provide wETH, USDT, DAI, BOR, and other ERC-20 Assets as collateral assets. In the instances of black swan events (such as the loss of the underlying Bitcoin), the collateralized assets will be liquidated and used to compensate oBTC holders. Therefore, oBTC holders are 100% asset protected. \n\nFor insurance, BoringDAO has partnered with both Cover Protocol and Nsure to provide boringDAO coverage. These decentralized insurance protocols can provide extra protection to the underlying Bitcoin if needed. In summary, every minted oBTC is backed by 1 Bitcoin (100%) + extra ERC-20 asset (50%) + decentralized insurance.\n\nOne unique feature that differentiates BoringDAO from other wrapped BTC is that it uses the”OP_Return” feature from Bitcoin wallets to link Users’ BTC address to their Ethereum address. This approach ensures that there is a low risk of single-point failure as we do not use centralized servers.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn the 3 weeks since launch, BoringDAO has managed to receive USD25mm TVL and minted 603 oBTC for its users. This exceptional performance has propelled us to the 7th most popular BTC-pegged token on DeBank.\n\nConcurrently,  Boring community has also partnered with DODO, Nsure, Bounce and Cover, to add more use cases for oBTC. BoringDAO’s near term goal is to facilitate more oBTC minting by adding more incentives and security measures for our users (expand multi-sig signers from 3 to 5 and integrate with more decentralized insurance protocols).\n\nWe believe add oBTC as collateral will be synergistic to both parties. BoringDao will be able to gain wider audience exposure, while C.R.E.A.M can unlock borrowing volume and fees to its holders as it participates in our growth. \n\nOverall, BoringDAO is actively seeking more use cases for oBTC and could bring more users and volume to DeFi protocol.\n\n## Benefits for C.R.E.A.M\n\n1. Bring extra BTC assets and liquidity to C.R.E.A.M.\n\n2. Provide multiple BTC options for C.R.E.A.M to improve overall robustness.\n\n3. Establish a channel between oBTC users, making C.R.E.A.M the default lending protocol.\n\nThe whole community would love to see oBTC could obtain better liquidity through C.R.E.A.M, so that users would have more usage scenarios. This proposal would bring spread income and incentives to the C.R.E.A.M protocol. \n\n### Our strength\n\nSecurity: triple pledged mechanism (Underlying Bitcoin + Pledged Collaterals + Insurance) that maximize safety.\n\nCommunity driven has attracted more talents and DeFi participants in BoringDAO’s community\n\nThe rapid growth of our TVL and exposure in DeFi community.\n\nHere’s the list we are going to add oBTC in the coming weeks:\n\nBadger\n\nCurve\n\nSushi\n\nPickle\n\nFortube\n\nAdditional Details on oBTC & BoringDAO can be found here:\n\nBlog: https://boringdao-defi.medium.com/\n\nApp: https://app.boringdao.com/\n\nWebsite: https://boringdao.com/\n\n## Specification\n\nBoringDAO & oBTC is fully open source and has been audited by Peckshield.

Finance.\n\nBy listing HEGIC, it becomes available for user to borrow HEGIC to buy lot, and diversify HEGIC investment in lots to something else, like lending HEGIC.

Not only has the protocol been adding new assets at a breakneck pace, but also shipping new products like ETH2 staking that launched last week. This is extremely positive for the protocol and CREAM holders.\n\nHowever, with the rapid pace of development and additions, important governance proposals are slipping through the cracks - potentially overlooked by the community. As such, the community should vote to improve these new governance guidelines.\n\nI suggest that any new proposals submitted to the governance forum on Snapshot should have a minimum of 3 days for the community to vote and deliberate. Once a new proposal is submitted, the team should immediately post to all social channels: Discord, Telegram, and Twitter.\n\nThis will ensure that enough time is allotted for all CREAM token holders to gain awareness of new listings, collateral factors, rewards, and other important decisions.\n\n=====proposal is drafted by AlienWatts=====\n\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/implement-minimum-3-day-period-for-new-governance-proposals/185",

However, the initial reward plan will end by 11/25 23:59 UTC +8. Without CREAM reward, it’s quite possible that the liquidity will go down, reducing the liquidity available for liquidators should that need arises. That’s why we need a new plan for CREAM reward for CRETH2.\n\nCommunity member Sherlock made the suggestion in Longer incentive for CRETH2/WETH liquidity provider and the core team agrees with this view of extending incentives for CRETH2 liquidity pool.\n\n## Specification\nThe reward plan is to distribute 12.8k CREAM in total. This 12.8k includes the first, ongoing 6k CREAM distribution (3k CREAM in CRETH2 and 3k in CRETH2/WETH pool).\n\nAfter the first-week reward is over:\n\n- 1k CREAM/week for 4 weeks, extending the CRETH2/WETH swap pool rewards\n- New: CRETH2 Supply/Borrow 700 CREAM/week for 4 weeks\n\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/reward-plan-for-creth2-liquidity/194",

Finance.\n\n**For**: List CRETH2 as collateral asset\n**Against**: Do nothing\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe team has launched a new product Cream ETH2 to enable the community to involve in ETH2 migration. This product allows users to stake ETH and become Validators of ETH2.\n\nThere are three motives to stake in CRETH2:\n\n1. Validator will be rewarded with ETH returns in ETH2. Details can be found [here](https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/ethereum-2-0/calculate).\n2. Use CRETH2 as collateral asset in C.R.E.A.M. Lending\n3. Earn reward from CRETH2/WETH reward pool\n\nThe second motive is the main idea of this proposal.\n\nIn the end, people will migrate from ETH to ETH2, but here we offer another usage of your ETH during the migration. By listing CRETH2 as collateral asset, there will be more benefits for participating in ETH2 through C.R.E.A.M. Finance.\n\n## Background\n\n### What Is Ethereum 2.0\n\nEthereum 2.0 (hereinafter referred to as ETH2) is the upcoming major upgrade to Ethereum Mainnet. It refers to a set of interconnected upgrades that will make Ethereum more scalable, more secure, and more sustainable. These upgrades are being built by multiple teams from across the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\n### More Scalable\n\nEthereum needs to support 1000s of transactions per second, to make applications faster and cheaper to use.\n\n### More Secure‌\n\nEthereum needs to be more secure. As the adoption of Ethereum grows, the protocol needs to become more secure against all forms of attack.\n\n### More Sustainable‌\n\nEthereum needs to be better for the environment. The technology today requires too much computing power and energy.\n\nMore details can be found in [Ethereum Official Website](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/get-involved/).",

DPI should be considered the safest asset on CREAM outside of stables and ETH. I propose we copy the [collateral factors of DPI's underlying tokens](https://docs.cream.finance/lending/collateral-factor-and-reserve-factor-1) as the initial collateral rate for DPI setting it at 45% LTV.\n\nConsidering it's more stable due to diversification and tokens are held 1:1 in reserve by a smart contract it should actually be substantially higher. Initially setting it equal to its components is a good precaution until DPI has a longer track record.\n\nHere is some data analysis on relative stability of DPI vs its underlying tokens and volatility compare to ETH:\n\n- https://medium.com/coinmonks/diversification-is-the-only-free-lunch-in-finance-dd225a5aba38\n- https://twitter.com/AnalyserOver/status/1322886283128090624\n- https://twitter.com/krugman25/status/1323422700157706243\n\n-----contents above are drafted by Kiba-----\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-increase-collateral-factor-for-dpi-to-50",

      "content": "Hello everyone, I want to share this proposal with the C.R.E.A.M. community, and I believe this can benefit the whole DeFi community.\n\n## Summary\n\nList HUSD as collateral asset on C.R.E.A.M. Lending.\n\n**For**: List HUSD as collateral asset\n**Against**: Do nothing\n\n## Background\n\nCategory: U.S. dollar backed stablecoin\nIssuer: Stable Universal limited\nCustodian: Paxos Trust\nBacked by: U.S. Dollar, 1:1 ratio\nAudit: Withum, monthly\nYear of Issuance: July, 2019\nSmart Contract is [here](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdf574c24545e5ffecb9a659c229253d4111d87e1)\n\nHUSD is an ERC-20 token that is 1:1 ratio pegged with USD. It was issued by Stable Universal.\n\nTo ensure the 1:1 backing is maintained, monthly audits of HUSD are conducted by an independent US audit firm. The reports can be checked [here](https://www.stcoins.com/attestation/index)\n\nSource: [HUSD official website](http://www.stcoins.com/)\n\n**How to get HUSD Liquidity**\n\n* Official website of HUSD: 1:1 exchange between USD and HUSD , fiat on/off ramp\n* Centralized Exchanges: Huobi, FTX, HBTC, Hotbit, Hoo\n* Decentralized Exchanges: Curve, Uniswap, Mooniswap , 0x, kyber network, tokenlon\n* DeFi Platforms: Fortube, YFII, 1inch, FYII (DFI.MONEY), BiDAO, HubDAO, MakerDao (green lighted)\n* OTCs: Amber Group, Huobi OTC, Legend Trading, FTX OTC, Paxos\n\n**HUSD Marketcap Ranking**\n\nAround $270M marketcap\n![image|690x471](upload://bR39WmPlldsNczAVqrhiUvW9k0o.png) \nsource: https://cryptoslate.com/cryptos/stablecoin/\n\n![image|690x401](upload://z7Y8NSsvpA9SEXb2tSEiziSfk31.png) \nsource: https://debank.com/ranking/stablecoin\n\n## Benefits for [C.R.E.A.M.]  Community\n\n**More Diversify For the System**\n\nFor Centralized stablecoins C.R.E.A.M. has supported, you can clear see the differences.\nBy adding a new stablecoin asset with monthly auditing, regulated trust holding and different issuer, can lower down the sysmetic risk. Even one of the issuer gets any problem (regulation, compliance, business operation.....), people can still use other stablecoin asset on C.R.E.A.M.\n\n![image|414x138](upload://kJiBY0rYqN5IltF6lIyogiU8obj.png)\n\n**Attract New Users For C.R.E.A.M.**\n\nAs HUSD has users in both centralized world and defi community, which is quite different from what USDT/USDC has,  it will brings C.R.E.A.M. more opportunities to landing new market.\n\n## Risk & Weakness\n\n*The market cap and liquidity of HUSD is relatively lower than USDT, USDC and the liquidity is not good as USDT, USDC. so the Collateral Factor of HUSD should be set lower.\n\n-----contents above are drafted by DeFiNavy-----\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-list-husd-as-collateral-asset",

      "content": "A proposal by Binance Btoken Team, Contact us: buidl@binance.org\n\n## Summary\n\nList BBTC as the collateral asset.\n\n**For**: List BBTC as a collateral asset\n**Against**: Do nothing\n\n## Background\n\nBBTC (Binance BTC) is the ERC20 token on the Ethereum network created via the Binance Token Canal program, launched on the 31.Otc 2020. Binance will lock a portion of tokens on their own native chains and mint the same number of tokens as ERC20 tokens on Ethereum with a naming convention of BBTC. Deposits and withdrawals for BBTC are enabled on binance.com by 31.Oct.2020. Check the [official announcement](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/b4b0312230964cf1a347d4712be5123d)\n\n## Motivation\n\n**Current Liquidity and the strategy of BBTC. Why should we have it?**\n\n[BBTC contract address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9be89d2a4cd102d8fecc6bf9da793be995c22541)\n\nBBTC was just launched last week, which is a very important strategy of Binance and Binance community to support cross-chain assets and liquidities, and we are approaching/ adding liquidity to the top DeFi protocols of Ethereum; \n\nHere’s the list we are going to add BBTC in the coming weeks: Uniswap, Aave, Curve, Compound, Cream, Fortube(Listed), MakerDao, Balancer, InstaDapp, and more. \n\n**Benefits for [Cream] and the general DeFi Community**\n\n**Larger User Bases and Liquidity Growth:**\nBinance is one of the largest crypto exchanges, and >15m Binance communities can potentially contribute to the DeFi ecosystem. BBTC will become an important bridge between CeFi and DeFi worlds, which will introduce quite decent liquidity in the DeFi ecosystem on Ethererum.\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n1. BBTC is an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network that represents a 1:1 peg of the same asset on their own blockchain.\n2. Heightened security and risk control measures for the wrapped tokens are in place, as well as using the SAFU fund to ensure the safety of users’ assets.\n\nBBTC might become an incentive token in the future. The holder will share the savings revenue of the BBTC they hold. (features are in design).\n\n**How to Exchange BBTC on Binance?**\nBinance.com users can deposit or withdraw BTokens by selecting the ERC20 network option in the Binance.com wallet when trying to deposit or withdraw. For example, BBTC is the BToken token representing BTC wrapped on Ethereum:\n\n1. To withdraw BBTC, users need to select the ERC20 network and input an ERC20 address on the BTC withdrawal page.\n2. To deposit BBTC users need to select the ERC20 network when depositing BTC and acquire the ERC20 deposit address for BTC.\n\nFurthermore, In the mid of Nov, Binance Bridge can support to transfer in/out of the BTC from the bitcoin network to Ethereum or vice versa, which will need a Binance.com account. \n\n\n**References**\nClick to find the official announcement from Binance: \n[Binance Token Canal Enables Wrapped BTokens on Ethereum](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/b4b0312230964cf1a347d4712be5123d)\n\nClick to find the official blog from Binance:\n[Token Canal Upgrade: Binance Wrapped BTokens on Ethereum, Panama Turns into Bridge](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684901158/Token-Canal-Upgrade-Binance-Wrapped-BTokens-on-Ethereum-Panama-Turns-into-Bridge)\n\nBBTC on the Coinmarket Cap/Coingecko:  In progress.\n\n[click to check Custodian and the Audit Report](https://github.com/binance-chain/token-canal-project)\n\nThanks, Regards.",

As one of the very first C.R.E.A.M. snapshot votes here, it has already been decided collectively that we should decrease the collateral factor of FTX. Now we should decide what that new level will be, as well as how much time we should allow FTT suppliers to unwind their borrow positions as needed.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nAs previously discussed, FTT is an illiquid token that is overwhelmingly supplied on C.R.E.A.M. by one holder (Alameda/SBF). While there is nothing wrong with a holder utilizing existing collateral for borrowing, the illiquid nature of FTT puts the C.R.E.A.M. protocol at risk should we ever need to liquidate any of these borrowing positions.\n\n-----contents above are drafted by Dudesahn-----\nDiscussion link: https://forum.cream.finance/t/proposal-decrease-ftt-collateral-factor/76/4",

      "title": "Add DeFiPulse Index ($DPI) as a collateral asset to CREAM market",
      "content": "## Summary\nDPI is an index that tracks the top DeFi tokens, launched by the well known DeFi Pulse and Set Protocol teams. Adding $DPI as collateral to CREAM will give us a more stable collateral asset, give us revenue from a top 50 DeFi token ([Coingecko Top 100 DeFi tokens](https://www.coingecko.com/en/defi)) and allow DPI holders to leverage their position.\n\n\n### About $DPI\nThe DeFi Pulse Index is a digital asset index designed to track tokens’ performance within the Decentralized Finance industry. The index is weighted based on the value of each token’s circulating supply. The DeFi Pulse Index aims to track projects in Decentralized Finance that have significant usage and show a commitment to ongoing maintenance and development. It aims to be for DeFi what the S&P500 is for the U.S. stock market.\n\nThe index methodology is managed by [DeFiPulse](https://defipulse.com/), one of the leading DeFi analysis websites, and runs on top of [Set Protocol](https://www.tokensets.com/), an OG DeFi dapp with ~$26M TVL. The ETF itself is managed by a DAO called [Index Coop](https://gov.indexcoop.com/), with DeFiPulse providing the rebalance weights and assets in accordance with their rigorous methodolohy. You can read about [the methodology](https://www.pulse.inc/) for how tokens are added and rebalanced for $DPI.\n\n\n**Stats**:\n- [$14M marketcap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/defipulse-index) (elastic supply, tokens are minted/redeemed, maximum potential marketcap is sum of all DeFi token marketcaps in the index)\n- 1,538 token holders (average ~$9,000 per holder)\n- $DPI currently controls ~0.3% of the total supply for all DeFi governance tokens\n- [Over 90% of DPI is provided as liquidity on Uniswap](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0x4d5ef58aac27d99935e5b6b4a6778ff292059991)\n- More [DPI/ETH liquidity on Uniswap](https://twitter.com/richardzliang/status/1314312640827547648?s=20) than the major tokens in the index\n- DPI/ETH is top 10 liquidity pools on Uniswap right now with $24M locked\n![](upload://48nj2cKKxksXTxgbJPZY8LUTQ9q.png)\n\n\n\n## Motivation\nI try to be an active contributing member to CREAM as much as possible and I think adding $DPI is a great opportunity for us. You guys may have seen me talk about CREAM before. I've proposed [new UI designs](https://twitter.com/KibaGateaux/status/1313167909594828801?s=20), suggested we [count timelocked CREAM in governance](https://forum.cream.finance/t/how-to-give-voting-power-to-people-that-locked-cream-for-1-years/26) which was approved by governance ([original twitter convo](https://twitter.com/KibaGateaux/status/1314238805428375553?s=20)), and other general twitter shenanigans.\n\n**Why should CREAM add $DPI?**\n1. CREAM already lists ~50% of the tokens held in the $DPI index - YFI, UNI, LEND, BAL, and COMP\n2. Because it is an index, DPI price is more stable than the underlying tokens making it a safer form of collateral.\n3. DPI is one of the most liquid pools in Uniswap with over $20M making it a top 10 pool which means there is enough liquidity for liquidations on CREAM platform.\n4. Substantial community support - [Spencer Noon](https://twitter.com/spencernoon/status/1305586149398925314?s=20), [David Hoffman](https://twitter.com/TrustlessState/status/1311879966024294400?s=20) (Bankless), [DeFi Rate](https://twitter.com/DeFiRate/status/1313917119004774400?s=20), [$YAM](https://twitter.com/fomosaurus/status/1313484433614426115?s=20), [DeFi Dad](https://twitter.com/DeFi_Dad/status/1306028274087342080?s=20), etc.\n6. Control of $DPI was transferred to Index Coop DAO about two weeks ago so we have just started marketing, integrations, and business development (this proposal included). If CREAM is the first lending protocol to accept DPI then the DeFi whales we are targeting will come to CREAM over other protocols to leverage their $DPI positions in order to yield farm, do spread trades, short the market, go leverage long, and create structured products.\n\nIt would be dope if DPI deposits/withdrawals got CREAM rewards but that will be a secondary proposal if this one is passed and CREAM community/team is interested in doing so.\n\nBefore someone asks - no we can not add CREAM to the index unless it falls under our strict [methodology](https://www.pulse.inc/) which is managed by DeFi Pulse, not the Index Coop DAO.\n\n-----Contents above are drafted by Kiba-----\n\nDiscussion link: [https://forum.cream.finance/t/add-defipulse-index-dpi-as-a-collateral-asset-to-cream-market/61](https://forum.cream.finance/t/add-defipulse-index-dpi-as-a-collateral-asset-to-cream-market/61)",

Write a proposal to conclude the whole idea\n    * Proposal MUST have a proper title to reveal the core idea\n    * Proposal MUST begin with Summary section (in short, please)\n    * Proposal MUST have Action Item section for explaining each voting option explicitly\n    * Proposal SHOULD use \"For\" / \"Against\" as options in binary decision\n    * Proposal SHOULD provide \"No Change Required\" as option in multiple choice \n    * Proposal CAN have Background, Motivation, Specification or any other aspect to support the idea, or use [EIP template](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/eip-template.md)\n4. Submit the proposal along with topic link [in Snapshot](https://vote.cream.finance) by holding 1,500 CREAM at least, which is also the minimum requirement for a proposal to list in Snapshot, and the voting period must be longer than 24 hours\n5.
