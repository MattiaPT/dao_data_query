      "title": "Invest in Photo Finish Track Ownership ",
      "content": "Lately I have been spending more time with Solana projects, and have found a project that I have actually been actively involved with for over a year (rare in the NFT space). This project is the horse racing game/ecosystem called Photo Finish. Here is a link to their main page. https://photofinish.live/home\n\nWatch any race as they play on the home page, and you can immediately see the polish the developers have put into this game. I wont get too detailed into the team here, but they previously had a non-crypto mobile game called Horse Racing Manager, that was very successful. They rolled that into a real money version via crypto, and are very close to getting it re-approved as an app. This will open the crypto version of their game up to a much larger audience. \n\nI did not get in at the mint of this project, but several of the people who did are making thousands of dollars every month. Early investment is not necessary though, in order to turn a profit. There are many avenues to make a profit - you can buy and race horses, you can breed and sell horses, you can wager on races, and you can even own a percentage of the tracks the horses run on. The first two require a much more active player, and wagering is obviously more of a gamble. The track ownership aspect of the game however, is entirely passive, and where I think we have an opportunity to make something of our investment. Their tradable crypto coin is called $CROWN and is on the Solana blockchain. $CROWN utility in the game involves staking it on race tracks to own a percentage of that track. Their in-game coin is called Derby, and that is how race entry fees are paid, horses are bought on the marketplace, and how all in game payouts are distributed. Derby is always pegged at a value of 80 Derby = $1 and is not a tradable coin, but can be exchanged into Sol USDC. \n\nThere are five public tracks in the game, and when players pay entry fees to race their horses, the track takes 20% of those entry fees. The way that 20% is paid out though, is determined by who has their $CROWN token staked on the various tracks. If you are the majority staker on a given track, you are actually considered to the the primary owner of that track, which allows some extra benefits. To own a majority of a track at this point would be out of reach for us, but my goal in this proposal is just to be a percentage owner. \n\nFor the last year, the CROWN stakers in this game have been earning about a 20% APY on whatever they have staked. For example, in my personal stable I have 5000 CROWN staked, which earned me 1630 Derby this past month. That comes out to about $20 a month or $240 a year. These payouts happen once a month, but you have to keep your CROWN staked for the whole month.\n\nMy actual proposal is this: \n\n- Create a Land Safe Account on Photo Finish \n\n- Purchase $10,000 worth of $CROWN\nA good platform to use for swapping from Eth to Sol is Simpleswap.io\nOnce we have Sol, we can convert it into CROWN using Jup.ag\n\n- Stake all of our $CROWN on the highest earning track from the previous season\n\n-At the end of the month convert the earned Derby back into USDC Sol for our treasury",

      "content": "The Land Safe has accumulated a relatively large amount of Surrealscapes and Prysms for the upcoming Futureverse 3rd Kingdom land resource game. In order to play the game effectively, we will need other Futureverse assets to assist in resource gathering. I propose we allocate up to .75 ETH to gather as many assets as possible (Flufs, Bears, Brains, Thingies, Seekers, Buzzies, Ray Guns, Eggs, et al.) The assets are VERY inexpensive right now, so we should take advantage of the current fire sale. Once more information about the mechanics of the game is released, the assets should increase in price. The Futureverse is a major web3 studio with tremendous potential, and I believe any investment now with pay huge dividends in the ‚Äúfuture.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.futureverse.com/\nhttps://enterthethirdkingdom.com/\n\n \n![Screenshot 2024-02-26 at 10.06.42‚ÄØAM.png](ipfs://bafybeibtduyj5e4ina6wdxzftjhga6zko3fztiunjdzxjl33gdejetliba)\n    ",

      "title": "Buy 1.5 ETH of Futureverse Prysms",
      "content": "The Third Kingdom Prysm Sale\n\nThe Futureverse has recently announced their strategy simulation game called The Third Kingdom. Everyone who possessed Flufworld Burrows at the snapshot was airdropped land, called Surrealscapes. Each Surrealscape contains a certain number of Parcels. Due to The Land Safe‚Äôs eight Burrows, we were dropped nine Surrealscapes (one for each Burrow, plus a bonus.) Our nine Surrealscapes contain a total of 35 Parcels. In order to extract value from the Parcels in the form of $ROOT (the Futureverse‚Äôs L1 token), $Mycelium (an in-game token), and other yet-to-be-named rewards, Prysms must be planted on the Parcels. Up to three Prysms can be planted on each Parcel. Prysms are currently on sale until April 10th at a cost of 696.9 $ROOT each. (Please note that the Futureverse is employing a ‚Äúfair value sale mechanic‚Äù that when/if the sale hits the max amount of 135k Prysms sold, the price of ALL Prysms will INCREASE. So we could potentially pay more than the initial cost of 696.9 $ROOT per Prysm if that threshold is met within the two week sale period.)\n\nThe Futureverse, based in New Zealand, is developing ground breaking web3 technology. They are an approximately 300 person team comprised of eleven different web3 companies and projects building the foundation of the open metaverse. In addition to their L1 blockchain (The Root Network), their artificial intelligence wing (Altered State Machine), their communications protocol (Sylo), and their gaming division, they have partnered with several web2 companies including Warner Brothers, FIFA, Reebok, and Ready Player One. In short, they‚Äôre not your typical web3 bootstrapped start-up.\n\nFor The Third Kingdom game, The Futureverse has partnered with Cool Cats, Doodles, Pudgy Penguins, Deadfellas, and Walker World. There is a prize pool of around $30 million included in season one. I‚Äôve read some back-of-the-envelope estimates that the return per Prysm should be a minimum of 3-4x, depending on how well the game is played. It seems to me that playing the game and staying invested in the Futureverse ecosystem could pay off in the long run. The team is special, and above and beyond anything I have seen in web3 to date. With their partnerships, their technological expertise, and their passion for a truly decentralized metaverse, I believe they are the surest bet in this space. \n\nMy proposal is to take 1.5 ETH from the treasury, and purchase as many Prysms as we can. We‚Äôre in the first few innings of a crypto bull run, and banking as much $ROOT as possible at this stage (currently valued at ~$0.10) seems like a good move. When alt-season hits, the market cap could skyrocket. Currently at ~$100 million, and relatively under the radar, it has a way to run, I believe. And hell, it‚Äôll be fun!\n\nhttps://www.futureverse.com/\n\nhttps://enterthethirdkingdom.com/\n\nhttps://theprawns.xyz/",

The new founders have got together with the pixels team and just released a game inside the Pixels multiverse and the floor is way down. The game is now live and playable with current utility minimal. I can only imagine as the months go by this project will continue to rise in price and while new utility is granted. They are there own plots of land that act as another home inside the Pixels multiverse. Pixels Farm Land floor is around .25 ETH right now and NuCyber lands are around a .03 ETH floor with both of them having very similar utility.

He appears on Crypto Banter's \"In the Game\", as well as his own channel. He advises Web3 gaming projects, and invests in the space. He knows more than I will ever know about investing in gaming & metaverse. \n\nThis Thing of Ours (TTOO) is an NFT project he launched during the bear market. The launch price was $250. The NFT gives you exclusive access to his investment signals, and other Alpha. It's styled as the \"gaming mafia\" and it has attracted some people who know what they are doing. The treasury is growing, and there will be treasury distribution of some sort in the coming weeks or months (for people who have staked their NFT's).\n\nProposal:\nBuy 1 x \"Capo\" NFT. This is the highest tier, and gives you exclusive access & higher allocation if you also hold a Nexus Pass (I'll come to that later). FP for Capo currently 1.47ETH\nBuy 5 x \"Soldiers\" NFT. FP 0.3389ETH\nTotal Investment (approx): (1.47+1.75 = 3.22ETH)\n\nStake Capo & 1 x soldiers\nHold until FP back over 1 ETH (which is a fairly safe bet IMO). \nSell 3 x soldiers to re-coup initial investment. \n\nAlternatively stake all and hold longer term. But IMO taking profits should be habitual.\n\nI think projects like this are far less riskier than trying to find the next big game. You are getting indirect exposure to the wider Web3 gaming & metaverse market and the insights of a major player. His Signals sometimes make me thousands in a day, as you get them before they hit YouTube. And if the treasury 10Xs due to early  entries, we will benefit.",

This is not widely advertised, IMO NeoTokyo has a more mature and sophisticated holder base.\n\nAs for $BYTES, I believe they are set to 5-10X this cycle, for a variety of reasons. Deflationary tokenomics, network effect, and the possibility that they will open up a small portion of CitizenCapital to non-citizens / the wider public, if they use $BYTES.",

      "content": "The Land Safe has been invited to join the Founder's Factory network. We believe this is a great opportunity to grow our project and reward both new and long-term holders. We are looking to finalize the decision with a vote from the community.\n\nPlease join us January 3, 2023 5:00 PM for an AMA with the founder of Founder‚Äôs Factory (FF), Talking Tree. He will discuss the mission of FF, how the network plans to grow and support each other, and how LandSafe holders can benefit from this partnership.\n\nFounder's Factory is a conglomerate of NFT projects and financiers working together to build each other up. Projects contribute resources to develop shared utilities, creating a network where each project has access to utilities that would difficult and expensive to develop independently. The goal of the network is for every project to gain significantly more value from the network than they contribute. The value of the network is greater than the sum of its parts and will continue to grow as more members join.\n\nPerks of joining the network:\n\nAll projects in the network are vetted, and doxxed before being approved to join. Founders of projects share a private server to meet, talk, and collaborate. Through these connections, we‚Äôll be able to find new points of value, attract new holders, and get guidance from successful founders + investors.\n$FNDR token generation\n$FNDR token is only generated by projects in the Founders Factory network. Once a project joins the network, all holders begin generating $FNDR. $FNDR can be used in the Founders Factory Marketplace which holds NFTs, WL opportunities, and IRL items. A handful of gaming consoles have been purchased with $FNDR and there are plans to add bigger items as the network grows, including but not limited to cars and vacations. Being able to purchase IRL items allows $FNDR to derive a real fiat value. Joining the network and gaining $FNDR generation would allow all of our holders to passively generate a token with tangible value. Further, $FNDR generation gives another reason for people to buy The Land Safe NFTs, so if you‚Äôre looking to sell, or we‚Äôre just looking for more sales volume to generate more revenue for our treasury, this is a win. $FNDR generation has already led to a few floor sweeps for FF projects by people looking to generate as much $FNDR as possible.\nWe are in communication with their team regarding a conversion factor for $RENT to $FNDR and seeking a way to augment future rewards for Genesis holders.\nFF is currently in the process of raising money to expand the network and finish more utilities to be shared by partner projects. The network is continuing to grow the VC and grant connections which can give us opportunities for Web3 grants and capital injections that could boost our treasury and therefore the burn value of all holders‚Äô NFTs.\nThrough the network (both projects, and VCs), we will get early access to Web3 investment opportunities we otherwise wouldn‚Äôt see, opening up more high return opportunities for our treasury funds.\nThere are a few requirements for joining the network:\n\nOur leadership or delegates from our project must attend weekly meetings with the other FF team and the other network founders.\nWe deposit 25 LandSafe NFTs from our Treasury to the FF Multi-Sig (5 Genesis & 20 tiered lands)\nWe deposit 0.5 ETH every month to help with operating costs and stocking the marketplace with IRL items.\nWe believe this is a phenomenal opportunity for The Land Safe to level up our network, get a token generating for our holders with real value, get more exciting investment opportunities, and get opportunities to inject more capital into our treasury.\n\nWould you like to see The Land Safe join the Founders Factory network, allowing LandSafe holders to earn $FNDR token to use in their marketplace?\n\nIf so, how long of a trial would you like to see: 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year? We suggest a minimum of 6 months as this would get us through our next Burn to see the impact that the FF membership has on burn values.",

It is very likely that like with computer games, new generation metaverses with higher quality graphics and better physical models will replace older ones. One of such \"new generation\" metaverses is TCG World - which, however, has several advantages if compared to competition:\n\nCompletion stage:\nAlpha version of the metaverse has been released and it is being currently tested (at present - by the team / moderators / real estate agents, in a couple of weeks access to the metaverse in testing regime should be given to land owners followed by general public shortly after than)\nFull release is expected in Q3 of this year.\n\nGraphics quality:\nAs one of the examples:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQhZWFYnMhk\n\nAs more people get access to Alpha version of the metaverse, I am sure there will be plenty videos on YouTube;\n\nCaution: do not make conclusion on the graphics quality based on the videos from the web site (and the web site itself) - it is outdated as of now since the team is focusing on completing the product itself.\n\nVariability\nTCG World has dedicated areas for a big variability of activites (racing track, entertainment zone, various gaming zones, etc) and conducts now negotiations with 3rd parties to fill these zones with content. This should attract big number of users with various needs, and hence stimulate increase of capitalization of the land in this project.",

My experience in the finance / investment industry tell me that it's time for us to start generating \"alpha\" in our investments and also setup a clear reporting that help us to know the value of our vault + help us to make informated decisions\n\nRational\n\nCurrently, TheLandDAO lacks of a clear reporting, financial assesment that may prevent us to take information decisiones in regards of our investment portfolio (we can be over exposed to some projects not performing well), and we are sitting on assets that does not accrue any other value to us appart from the possible appraisal of its (floor) price in the market\n\nProposal:\n\nFor that reasons, I propose the creation of Portfolio Managers Position, this position will be in charge of:\n\nFinancial & Investment Reporting, as proposed by 0xE0A22c760d11e81Da08046F457862622aD4553CD in: https://snapshot.org/#/thelanddaoprop.eth/proposal/0x1a703c671951d77a439e4f0ef6cc938ced60dd70d2e36d1ecdb36c33f42614c8\n\nExecute & Actively looking for yield bearing strategies for our assets as proposed by me in the followed proposal: https://snapshot.org/#/thelanddaoprop.eth/proposal/0x4e8771c5be911898f12d6e37133420f3520d64d221816bd07df6194d31dae39b\n\nHost bi weekly AmAs to inform the communities / Board regarding the progresses and value creation (alpha)\n\nFollow market news / general nft news to suggest assets / derisk posibilities to benefit the DAO Vault\n\nSuggested Next Steps:\n\nIf this proposal is accepted, this should be sent to the Board to stablish requirements + potential compensation",

      "title": "Buy up to 30 parcels in XONE metaverse (max of 2 ETH in total)",
      "content": "Proposed purchase: up to 30 parcels of floor XONE NFT parcels at under mint price (max of 2 ETH total to be spent). Proposal is for floor to be swept over then next 2 weeks at the lowest price under .11 ETH each, with the goal to pick up as many parcels as possible at .04-.08 ETH.\n\nI believe these are significantly undervalued given their upcoming partnerships with Universal Music and close ties with Sony and Warner Music. They are also working on a deal with an AR glasses company which plans to feature XONE as the primary example of what their glasses can do. XONE would be included as a built-in app with their device. XONES have already partnered with CryptoWalkers and Jurassic Punks to support their avatars to roam across the XONE metaverse.\n\nAbout XONE: XONE is a Web3 iOS social application that lets you create, discover, and share immersive 3D spaces. Think of each XONE parcel as the evolution of your social media profile. XONE focuses on building social spaces where you can voice and text chat, attend events, explore with avatars and much more. Their vision is to build the next evolution of social media and leverage their background in the music and entertainment industry to achieve scale. They already have a working app for iPhone and Android.\n\nThere will be 4 primary realms within the XONE map ‚Äì Jungle, Cloud, Underwater, and Desert ‚Äì for a total of 10K parcels. For holders with one parcel of each realm, a 4th Mystery realm will be available to mint.\n\nIntegration with other Metaverse land: Today XONE can integrate easily with other browser-based platforms by integrating QR codes in existing platforms. Scanning a QR code with a phone on a desktop browser launches XONE in the palm of your hand. Each XONE can be fully customized according to the holder's preferences. Several community members are planning to use these features to create branded spaces and host events.\n\nSince launch, XONEs have sold for an average of .23 ETH. At a floor of around .04 ETH, there is a lot of room for profit down the road as brand partnerships become publicized and promoted. They are about to launch a big marketing campaign and will be releasing a customizable version of their XONE app this Summer. Now is a great time to get in on this undervalued project.\n\nLinks:\nhttps://xone.gg/\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/xones",

      "title": "Invest in Lux Metaverse Realestate",
      "content": "Lux are building a cross blockchain VR, AR and Desktop Metaverse\n\nThey are native to Solana, but are about to have an Avatar mint on ETH - the \"Sachi\" collection, designed by a well known gaming concept artist.\nBased on the quality of the build / VR experience, & recent depreciation due to the wider market fallout, I think Lux is a potentially good investment. The project / team will feature in an upcoming Forbes Magazine interview, and they have experience working with real-world companies such as BMW, IKEA and Lufthansa. They have also done projects for the Swedish government in the past.\n\n5 Tiers of Land:\nApartment (3000 units)\nDuplex (900 units)\nCondo (600 units)\nPenthouse (400 units)\nMansion (100 units)\n\nTotal Volume traded (Magic Eden): 96,030 SOL\n\nFollowing the sold-out Lux mint, Lux recorded the highest trading volumes on Magic Eden. Apartments were changing hands for 18-20 SOL (back when SOL was $200), and Penthouses were going for upwards of 70 SOL. I think a mansion got sold for 150 SOL. Current prices are as follows:\n\nApartment: 2 SOL\nDuplex: 3.79 SOL\nCondo: 4.8 SOL\nPenthouse: 12.79 SOL\nMansion: 54 SOL\n\nI propose the DAO purchases:\n\n1 x Mansion @54 SOL (which could be good advertising for the DAO - FTX has one, as do most leading Solana NFT projects). Stake for $Lux token\n\n6 x Penthouses under 20 SOL (FP goes up to 50 SOL after this). Stake for $Lux Token\n\nMax Expenditure: 174 SOL = $6,960\n\nThe DAO could buy apartments, but I think the Penthouses will be more sought after, and if you can buy at 10-15 SOL, we should be able to make a 5X on them during the next bull run. A reference point should be Portals, which as a FP of 41 SOL for the most basic Ivory apartment, and 221 SOL for the mid tier Onyx. I also compare the real estate demos to Exclusible.\n\nThe staking rewards for real estate are as follows, although the $LUX token price is yet to be established (it's pre IDO):\n\nApartment: 1000 $LUX per week\nDuplex: 1200 $LUX per week\nCondo: 1400 $LUX per week\nPenthouse: 1600 $LUX per week\nMansion: 2000 $LUX per week\n\nOne possible strategy would be to buy Lux Realestate pre the upcoming avatar mint, and sell during or after, if there is a pump. Another would be to buy and stake until the next bull run. I don't think prices will fall beneath current levels, and Solana is currently selling at a discount, which makes the real estate relatively cheap. During the next bull run the DAO could sell everything, or retain the Mansion as a presence / clubhouse in the Metaverse.\n\nOne of the main concerns I have had with Lux is their lack of decent marketing. I am assured that this will change soon, after the product is released. But other than that, it's a professional team that's focused on delivering results. They have frequent announcements on the Discord, and regular AMA's with Chris, the founder.",

      "title": "Participate in Enigma Economy v5 Mint",
      "content": "Proposed purchase: Enigma Economy V5 NFTs (BTC/LTC/DOGE Miners) x 10.5 ETH\nProposal by @SoreThunder with input from @WarriorMama\n\nWhy Enigma Economy?\nEnigma Economy decreases the barriers to entry to allow greater access to cryptocurrency mining (BTC, LTC, DOGE, KDA ‚Äì rewards can also be converted to ETH).\n\nTheir V1/V2 collection was launched in November 2021, their V3 collection launched in January of 2022 and their V4 collection launched in April of 2022. All of these collections are considered ‚ÄúGenesis Miners‚Äù and will subsequently scale with further mints and partnerships, V1/2/3 scaling more than v4. Scaling is achieved multiple ways ‚Äì hosting fees, reinvestment periods and a potential ICO. V1/2/3 are reinvesting till July of 2022 and V4 until November of 2022. Hosting fees received from hosting other communities‚Äô machines at Enigma‚Äôs facility go to purchasing more machines for Genesis holders.\n\nBMC has recently signed an agreement with Enigma to host all of their machines at Enigma‚Äôs facility. Unlike BMC, Enigma holders actually receive the native token of the blockchain the machines are mining ‚Äì BTC, LTC, DOGE, KDA or converted to ETH instead of a community token like $HASH. This was proven by a POC distribution that happened in 2022 and by community members who are also part of the ‚ÄúBuy and Host (B&H)‚Äù program, who have received their mining rewards bi-weekly, without fail.\n\nWith B&H, an Enigma holder can purchase a machine at a discounted price and host that machine at Engima‚Äôs facility. Enigma is putting a twist on this and offering their V5 mint, which will fractionalize the ownership of the Bitmain Antminer L7‚Äôs. Essentially, ~67 v5‚Äôs will equal (1) L7.\n\nV5 Details\nThe cost to mint a V5 during the preseed round is $112.50 ($125 after preseed round) valued in ETH at the time of mint. With the least optimistic expectation of return, we can cap an L7 miner at $17/day, minus hosting fee of 22.5% = $13.20 per day/$401.50 per month/$4818 per year. Assuming each NFT is 1.5% of a miner, you would need 66.66 of them (67) for 100% of a miner = $112.50 x 67 = $7537.50. So payback (not ROI) is 18.5 months - the distinction being that you still own the NFT. This effectively means a 200% ROI by this point should you decide to list at price minted. Or just continue to mine profitably supplying that regular income to the treasury. NFT artwork is made by well known NFT artist Sylvio Vieira https://superrare.com/silviovieiraart.\n\nProposal\nAfter consultation with members of the Enigma Economy Discord and our LandSafe Community members who are deeply familiar with the project, we suggest the following purchases (floor prices are subject to change):\nV5 Mint: up to 150 (2.25 machines) x $112.50 (~10.5 Eth)\nNote: these numbers may be adjusted by the team based on floor prices at the actual time of purchase. Purchases not to exceed 12 ETH including gas fees.\n\nDo you want to see the LandSafe make these purchases for our community wallet?\n\nOther notable communities participating in preseed round:\nLlamaverse\nMighty Labs\nNifty Nuggets\nMagma\nDysto Apez\n\nWebsite - https://www.enigmaeconomy.com/\nv5 FAQ - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4OyFAmTxRxqnbF_B9SmNfrO8BW",

Your vault level is basically your rewards level.\nAn S1 Citizen with a low 2 reward value is about 7 eth, mid reward of 6 is 15 eth, to an elite citizen worth 50 eth.\nBy owning an S1 Citizen you will earn $bytes ($4.5 per) when your NT is staked, and have the ability to stake those $bytes, earning more. Earning ratio‚Äôs are not yet made public because they have revamped the whole tokenomics. Therefore, it is impossible to give an APR or earning ratio.\nNT has been building an amazing ecosystem all by using $bytes and the project is based on VC funding opportunities, which will be huge in the bull market and when mass adoption comes along.\nBy staking 200 $bytes you will be able to enter into the raffle system to get involved with these early funding opportunities.\nOne other big reason I am proposing this is because NT has worked on developing metaverse lands and if this is an option for us, NT will be the place to get all the info and help we need.\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/neotokyo-citizens",

      "content": "Founder's Factory is a conglomerate of NFT projects and financiers working together to support each other's growth. Projects contribute resources to develop shared utilities, creating a network where each project has access to utilities that would be difficult and expensive to develop independently. The goal of the network is for every project to gain significantly more value from the network than they contribute. The value of the network is greater than the sum of its parts and will continue to grow as more members join.\n\nPerks of staying in the network:\n\nAll projects in the network are vetted and doxxed before being approved to join. Founders of projects share a private server to meet, talk, and collaborate. Through these connections, we'll be able to continue finding new points of value, attract new holders, and get guidance from successful founders and investors.\n\nGasless fully implemented:\n\nFounders Factory has now successfully launched its gasless infrastructure, meaning that it will never cost any more gas money to interact within the ecosystem for current and future utilities.\n\nCurrent and upcoming utilities:\n\nWe will continue to benefit from Founders Alpha that we have access to in our server. We can continue to use the marketplace.\n\nFounders Factory is launching their Genie Lottery, as well as an adventure mode that will be their first step towards gamification.\n\nFF is currently in the process of raising money to expand the network and finish more utilities to be shared by partner projects. The network is continuing to grow the VC and grant connections, which can give us opportunities for Web3 grants and capital injections that could boost our treasury and, therefore, the burn value of all holders' NFTs.\n\nThrough the network, both projects and VCs, we will get early access to Web3 investment opportunities we otherwise wouldn't see, opening up more high-return opportunities for our treasury funds.",

      "content": "Proposed purchase: 5K worth of Enigma Economy EMF2 fractionalized mining NFTs (20 at $250 each), approx. 3 ETH\n\nProposal by WarriorMama\n\nSpecifics: After a very successful launch of their EMF1 fractionalized mining NFTs, Enigma Economy is launching another mining collection of EMF2s.  The LandSafe brought in .38 ETH in the past month from the current 150 EMF1s that we own.  Because of some killer deals that the team has made on energy prices, the new EMF2 collection stands to bring in an even greater return.  The EMF2s are expected to have a 6-8% return, with an estimate of .2 ETH/mo back for the purchase of 20 EMF2s.  The EMF2s will mine 50% BTC and 50% LTC/Doge.  They will be purchasing the type of miner that allow them to capitalize on the mining fees for Ordinals (Bitcoin NFTs).\n\nDo you approve of this purchase?",

The game is now live and playable with current utility minimal. I can only imagine as the months go by this project will continue to rise in price and while new utility is granted. They are there own plots of land that act as another home inside the Pixels multiverse.

      "title": "Participate in Enigma Economy v5 Mint",
      "content": "Proposed purchase: Enigma Economy V5 NFTs (BTC/LTC/DOGE Miners) x 10.5 ETH\nProposal by @SoreThunder  with input from @WarriorMama \n\nWhy Enigma Economy?\nEnigma Economy decreases the barriers to entry to allow greater access to cryptocurrency mining (BTC, LTC, DOGE, KDA ‚Äì rewards can also be converted to ETH). \n\nTheir V1/V2 collection was launched in November 2021, their V3 collection launched in January of 2022 and their V4 collection launched in April of 2022. All of these collections are considered ‚ÄúGenesis Miners‚Äù and will subsequently scale with further mints and partnerships, V1/2/3 scaling more than v4. Scaling is achieved multiple ways ‚Äì hosting fees, reinvestment periods and a potential ICO. V1/2/3 are reinvesting till July of 2022 and V4 until November of 2022. Hosting fees received from hosting other communities‚Äô machines at Enigma‚Äôs facility go to purchasing more machines for Genesis holders. \n\nBMC has recently signed an agreement with Enigma to host all of their machines at Enigma‚Äôs facility. Unlike BMC, Enigma holders actually receive the native token of the blockchain the machines are mining ‚Äì BTC, LTC, DOGE, KDA or converted to ETH instead of a community token like $HASH. This was proven by a POC distribution that happened in 2022 and by community members who are also part of the ‚ÄúBuy and Host (B&H)‚Äù program, who have received their mining rewards bi-weekly, without fail. \n\nWith B&H, an Enigma holder can purchase a machine at a discounted price and host that machine at Engima‚Äôs facility. Enigma is putting a twist on this and offering their V5 mint, which will fractionalize the ownership of the Bitmain Antminer L7‚Äôs. Essentially, ~67 v5‚Äôs will equal (1) L7.\n\nV5 Details\nThe cost to mint a V5 during the preseed round is $112.50 ($125 after preseed round) valued in ETH at the time of mint. With the least optimistic expectation of return, we can cap an L7 miner at $17/day, minus hosting fee of 22.5% = $13.20 per day/$401.50 per month/$4818 per year. Assuming each NFT is 1.5% of a miner, you would need 66.66 of them (67) for 100% of a miner = $112.50 x 67 = $7537.50. So payback (not ROI) is 18.5 months - the distinction being that you still own the NFT. This effectively means a 200% ROI by this point should you decide to list at price minted. Or just continue to mine profitably supplying that regular income to the treasury. NFT artwork is made by well known NFT artist Sylvio Vieira https://superrare.com/silviovieiraart.\n\nProposal\nAfter consultation with members of the Enigma Economy Discord and our LandSafe Community members who are deeply familiar with the project, we suggest the following purchases (floor prices are subject to change):\nV5 Mint: up to 150 (2.25 machines) x $112.50 (~10.5 Eth)\nNote: these numbers may be adjusted by the team based on floor prices at the actual time of purchase. Purchases not to exceed 12 ETH including gas fees.\n\nDo you want to see the LandSafe make these purchases for our community wallet?\n\nOther notable communities participating in preseed round:\nLlamaverse\nMighty Labs\nNifty Nuggets\nMagma \nDysto Apez\n\nWebsite - https://www.enigmaeconomy.com/\nv5 FAQ - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4OyFAmTxRxqnbF_B9SmNfrO8BW \n \n![Enigma_V5.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreifls2jxkiadj63nprcbfrw62nssgcbtlpewc4vvwjentdbdughz7u)\n    \n    \n    \n    ",

      "title": "Join Founder's Factory Network",
      "content": "The Land Safe has been invited to join the Founder's Factory network. We believe this is a great opportunity to grow our project and reward both new and long-term holders. We are looking to finalize the decision with a vote from the community. \n\nPlease join us January 3, 2023 5:00 PM for an AMA with the founder of Founder‚Äôs Factory (FF), Talking Tree. He will discuss the mission of FF, how the network plans to grow and support each other, and how LandSafe holders can benefit from this partnership. \n\nFounder's Factory is a conglomerate of NFT projects and financiers working together to build each other up. Projects contribute resources to develop shared utilities, creating a network where each project has access to utilities that would difficult and expensive to develop independently. The goal of the network is for every project to gain significantly more value from the network than they contribute. The value of the network is greater than the sum of its parts and will continue to grow as more members join.\n\nPerks of joining the network:\n- All projects in the network are vetted, and doxxed before being approved to join. Founders of projects share a private server to meet, talk, and collaborate. Through these connections, we‚Äôll be able to find new points of value, attract new holders, and get guidance from successful founders + investors. \n- $FNDR token generation\n$FNDR token is only generated by projects in the Founders Factory network. Once a project joins the network, all holders begin generating $FNDR. $FNDR can be used in the Founders Factory Marketplace which holds NFTs, WL opportunities, and IRL items. A handful of gaming consoles have been purchased with $FNDR and there are plans to add bigger items as the network grows, including but not limited to cars and vacations. Being able to purchase IRL items allows $FNDR to derive a real fiat value. Joining the network and gaining $FNDR generation would allow all of our holders to passively generate a token with tangible value. Further, $FNDR generation gives another reason for people to buy The Land Safe NFTs, so if you‚Äôre looking to sell, or we‚Äôre just looking for more sales volume to generate more revenue for our treasury, this is a win. $FNDR generation has already led to a few floor sweeps for FF projects by people looking to generate as much $FNDR as possible.\n- We are in communication with their team regarding a conversion factor for $RENT to $FNDR and seeking a way to augment future rewards for Genesis holders. \n- FF is currently in the process of raising money to expand the network and finish more utilities to be shared by partner projects. The network is continuing to grow the VC and grant connections which can give us opportunities for Web3 grants and capital injections that could boost our treasury and therefore the burn value of all holders‚Äô NFTs.\n- Through the network (both projects, and VCs), we will get early access to Web3 investment opportunities we otherwise wouldn‚Äôt see, opening up more high return opportunities for our treasury funds.\n\nThere are a few requirements for joining the network:\n- Our leadership or delegates from our project must attend weekly meetings with the other FF team and the other network founders.\n- We deposit 25 LandSafe NFTs from our Treasury to the FF Multi-Sig (5 Genesis & 20 tiered lands)\n- We deposit 0.5 ETH every month to help with operating costs and stocking the marketplace with IRL items.\n\nWe believe this is a phenomenal opportunity for The Land Safe to level up our network, get a token generating for our holders with real value, get more exciting investment opportunities, and get opportunities to inject more capital into our treasury. \n\nWould you like to see The Land Safe join the Founders Factory network, allowing LandSafe holders to earn $FNDR token to use in their marketplace? \n\nIf so, how long of a trial would you like to see: 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year? We suggest a minimum of 6 months as this would get us through our next Burn to see the impact that the FF membership has on burn values.\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/Founders_Factory",

      "title": "Buy 10 x This Thing of Ours NFT's",
      "content": "Name: This Thing of Ours\nOpenSea Link: https://opensea.io/collection/this-thing-of-ours-nft\nFounder: @hustlepedia (YouTube) / @HustlepediaYT (Twitter)\nFocus / Industry: Web3 Gaming\n\nThis Thing of Ours (TTOO) is a Web3 Gaming community and advisory agency by @hustlepedia. Johnny / @hustlepedia is a Web3 Gaming advisor, YouTuber focusing on Blockchain Gaming, and crypto investor focused on the gaming industry. He has his own YouTube show (Hustlepedia), but also acts as Crypto Banter‚Äôs in house gaming expert (producing ‚ÄúIn The Game‚Äù segment). He regularly features on Paul Barron Network and other major channels.\n\nValue Proposition:\nFor me, TTOO is a ‚Äúpicks and shovels‚Äù spread bet on the nascent Blockchain Gaming industry. It‚Äôs hard to pick early-stage games, so investing in a key person in the Web3 gaming community is to me, a safer bet. Other utility built into the project:\n\n‚Ä¢ Over 100 NFT Treasury Assets accumulated, 30+ gaming, NFT and utility alliances. As Hustle is a gaming advisor to projects, his intuition and investment thesis is generally solid. Below are the treasury wallets. The project currently has $251,000 USDC & $36,000 worth of NFT‚Äôs. If we combine these values and divide by the total number of TTOO NFT‚Äôs (2000), we get a value of $143 per NFT. But that obviously doesn‚Äôt take into account value attached to the influence of the person, or the community. Below are links to the holdings.\n‚Ä¢https://dappradar.com/hub/wallet/eth/0x9074a6eedbc32abbffa64cccaee7e970155f8249\n‚Ä¢https://etherscan.io/address/0x74213597f96cF601FFB85aE169213b3FcfECf181\n‚Ä¢ Holders will be able to access the coaching service (business, crypto, cash flow, growing personal brand) free of charge ($1500/yr value).\n‚Ä¢ Free Youtube Growth Course ‚Äì 15.5 hours ($250 value). Affiliate program for holders to earn.\n‚Ä¢ Weekly Crypto Gaming Reports\n‚Ä¢ Hustle‚Äôs Portfolio Overview & Signals\n‚Ä¢ TTOO Early Access, Exclusive Skins and WL Opportunities to Top Web3 Gaming Ecosystems\n‚Ä¢ NFT Gaming Treasury, Acquiring Gaming Assets to Use over time, completely community owned\n‚Ä¢ Steady Stack News\n‚Ä¢ Steady Stack BTC/ETH Basic Algo\n\nTypes of NFT ‚Äì Capos vs Soldiers\nCapo‚Äôs = 300\nSoldiers - 1700\nThere types of TTOO NFT‚Äôs ‚Äì Capos & Soldiers (Capos being rarer, with increased utility). It‚Äôs best if you check out the Discord for the information & benefits.\n\nTiers:\nTier 3 = Hold 1 TTOO NFT\nTier 2 = Hold 2 or 3 TTOO NFTs\nTier 1 = Hold 4 TTOO NFTs or More\n‚ÄúShould you hold more than one NFT? We'll have a NFT Gaming Backed treasury where holders will be tiered into shareholder brackets based on the quantity of the TTOO NFTs they hold. More holdings will result in more true governance in treasury acquisition votes for assets, etc. On top of that, holders will have more potential for higher rewards in the future by being in a higher holder tier.‚Äù\n\nSummary:\nI believe TTOO will become one of the most influential communities in the Web3 Gaming industry. It will be far more relevant than the Web3 Gaming Guilds of the last bull run (Merit Circle, Blackpool etc) as it‚Äôs focused on a more sustainable business model, not ponzi tokenomics. The ‚ÄúConsigliere‚Äôs‚Äù in the Discord are an impressive array of founders and key members of gaming projects. These include people from; Blowfish Studios, Opus Labs, Phantasma, Collider Craftworks, Pixelmon, WAGMI games, The Bornless. Hustle also speaks to people like the head of Polygon Studios on his channel, so has a finger on the pulse.\n\nWhat Should The Land Safe Do:\nSweep the floor / accumulate TTOO NFT‚Äôs in the $250-$350 range. I suggest grabbing 10 Soldiers. The project minted at $250 USDC, rose quickly to over 1 ETH, and has retraced during this bear market / FTX crash. However, there are very few actually listed, and the price is stable. I cannot see it dipping below the $250-$300 mark, even in an extended bull market.\nCurrent Floor Price (Soldier): 0.245 ETH / $323\nCurrent Floor Price (Capo): 1.4 ETH\nNumber until 0.5ETH: 17 NFT‚Äôs\nNumber until 1 ETH Floor Price: 26NFT‚Äôs\n\nInvestment:\n10 x Soldiers at an average price of 0.250 ETH = 2.5 ETH investment.\nSell 3 @ 1 ETH to cover investment and take profit.\nSell more during next bull run (unless utility is providing decent returns).\nIt may be worth trying to buy a Capo if the FP on these dip, as they do unlock a few additional utilities. But I think 10+ soldiers would be the way to go.\n\nThe NFT's themselves are about to be revealed. To date they've just had placeholder images on them.",

      "content": "I propose that we liquidate all NFT Worlds and $WRLD token.\n\nNFT Worlds is led by a team that thought they could get away with obviously stolen IP from a massive corporation (Microsoft). They proceeded to irresponsibly take millions from investors to build off of this fundamentally broken foundation. Investors, including us have had to pay the price for their poor decisions. Too much of our portfolio's value was wiped out by the impulsive decision to dump our ETH into the hype wave of NFT Worlds without acknowledging the foundation of stolen IP. \n\nI believe it is unwise to trust the team the made these idiotic and unethical decisions to turn around and make responsible decisions moving forward. The value of the NFTs will likely continue to decline. While selling at this much of a loss is rough, we need to have a line where we cut our losses. I believe I should've made the proposal to liquidate as soon as Microsoft first announced they wouldn't support NFT Worlds. NFT Worlds' response saying they will create essentially another Minecraft to build on could be called \"ambitious\" in the most positive light. I think it's more likely that they quickly crafted a narrative to try to calm holders and retain as much value as possible in the short term without having any of the details lined up to confidently execute on these promises. They likely then proceeded to scramble to put together the pieces to potentially pull this off. Even if they do succeed, they are likely setting themselves up for a lawsuit from Microsoft due to ripping off Minecraft. If their announcement of building an alt Minecraft is truthful, it seems that they are yet again treading on dangerous territory regarding IP issues AND Microsoft already has its eyes on them.\n\nI believe we will likely be better off taking the loss at this point and either holding the ETH or reinvesting into better projects that can generate predictable returns or are led by strong, ethical teams. Even just holding the ETH will likely perform better than letting these NFTs go to 0 due to leadership's poor decision making.\n\nI acknowledge that I can't predict the future and that I could be wrong. At this stage, we need to recover all the ETH we can for this project to develop a new direction. \n\nIf anyone has more insight on what's going on over there, please share in chat! I'm very open to being wrong. I ultimately want to make the best move for our portfolio. Best idea wins. \n\n3 voting options will be provided\n1. Liquidate all NFT Worlds and $WRLD\n2. Continue to hold\n3. Liquidate some, hold some (This will require further discussion and proposals to dial in exactly what we want to do)\n\nPosted by NoneYaBusiness#0267",

      "content": "Proposed Purchase: Purchase 214 Genesis Bodega Blocks for $40,000 USD (30.5 ETH)\n\nProposed by @Boardshorts | TheLandSafe\nDisclosure: Boardshorts is a Senior Mod for the Bodega Blocks Project and owns 3 Preferred Genesis NFTs\n\nWe negotiated a Bulk Purchase for a Discount of 20%. This effectively increases the yield of each Bodega Blocks NFT to 72%\nProjected Annual Returns: $30,000 USD (23 Eth)\nDaily Minimum Returns: $79-$80\nROI timeline: 490 days\n\nBodega Blocks is a utility-driven, generative urban art collection that generates passive rewards in the form of stable coin to its holders. The Bodega Blocks Project operates various master nodes and receives Block Rewards in return. These rewards are then passed on to holders according to the Bodega Blocks they own. Rewards are generated daily and holders can claim whenever they please.\n\nA master node facilitates decentralized management and administration of the distributed network such that the network will not favor any country, geography, company or person because those running masternodes have additional responsibilities such as voting on development matters and issues. They ensure a decentralized budgeting system and an immutable proposal and voting system.\n\nBased on the tier of NFT you own and the mint price, a base rate of 50%-72% APR (potentially more based on the performance) will be assessed and distributed via USDT, USDC, or ETH (holder chooses).\n\nWhy we think this is a reasonable, safe move for the LandSafe Project\n- 72% APR Passive Stablecoin Rewards \n- Floor Stability System where the team will buy back and burn NFTs listed below certain defined floor prices, maintaining floor stability for holders. Rewards will be reallocated to remaining NFTs, increasing APR over time.\n- Doxxed Experienced Team of successful crypto/DeFi traders and yield farmers\n- Innovative Generative Art System\n- Collabs with various NFT Artists\n\nI've spent time with the founders directly and have built trust with them. Their first collection \"The Preferred Genesis\" (JUST SOLD OUT) has been generating 72% APR to holders daily and the rewards system is working perfectly so far. The team also has put money aside to assure that even if everything went wrong with the project, and 0 money was made, holders would still have rewards for ~1.5-2 years. They have a very long-term view on this project and their growth system. The founders will only pay themselves from profits generated AFTER holders are paid their promised returns.\n\n\nWhitepaper: https://www.bodegablocks.io/whitepaper\nWebsite: https://bodegablocks.io/ \n",

      "content": "Proposed purchase: 8 ETH of various BMC NFTs, including upcoming land parcels\n\nProposal by @WarriorMama with input from @TyZen99 and @MG\n\nBlockchain Miners Club (BMC) decreases the barriers to entry to allow greater access to bitcoin mining.  Their OG collection was launched in November 2021.  Each of these OG Miners produce at least 1 $HASH token daily.  OG Miners were burned 2 for 1 to create Ultra Miners, which produce a minimum of 10 $HASH per day and have twice the voting rights of OG Miners.  BMC will be releasing the first ‚ÄúPlay-to-Mine‚Äù game Mission to Mars on November 1st, followed shortly after by their limited edition land mint.  They recently launched their Hashdroids, which will be required to play the upcoming game.  Rocket Passes (which were first used to mint Hashdroids) will have exclusive in-game benefits that have yet to be revealed and allow access to future supply drops.  Many people advise have 1 Rocket Pass for every Hashdroid.  It is expected that land will be limited to about 500 supply.  These Mars Lands will have special ‚Äúhost-to-earn‚Äù features, including earning a % of other players‚Äô mining yields and a % of burned $HASH.  \n\nAfter consultation with members of the BMC Discord and our LandSafe Community members who are deeply familiar with the project, we suggest the following purchases (floor prices are subject to change): \nHashdroids: 10 x .18 (1.8 ETH)\nRocket pass: 10 x .04 (.4 ETH)\nUltra Miners: 3 x .35 ETH (1.05 ETH)\nLand: 2 x 2.25 (4.75 ETH)\n\nNote: these numbers may be adjusted based on floor prices at the actual time of purchase as the discretion of the team.  Purchases not to exceed 8.5 ETH including gas fees.  \n\nBMC recently won 1st place on Ape Tank, which is like the Shark Tank of NFT projects for BAYC holders.  \nPlaying the game will allow us to play-to-mine BTC for the community wallet.   \n\nWhitepaper: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Us1vxCmZBR2oPnoIZWviP_rosRLkmosNpBOSb0-ffwQ/edit?usp=sharing\nWhitepaper Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eIoHdcEsrM&t=65s \n\nDo you want to see the LandSafe make these purchases for our community wallet?  \n\n![BMC proposal.jpg](ipfs://bafkreih5wfthorx2lgq4sytql3old2pd5blyazndyz4w3yrd4w3im5tx3a)\n ",

      "title": "Invest in Lux Metaverse Realestate",
      "content": "Lux are building a cross blockchain VR, AR and Desktop Metaverse\n\nThey are native to Solana, but are about to have an Avatar mint on ETH - the \"Sachi\" collection, designed by a well known gaming concept artist. \nBased on the quality of the build / VR experience, & recent depreciation due to the wider market fallout, I think Lux is a potentially good investment. The project / team will feature in an upcoming Forbes Magazine interview, and they have experience working with real-world companies such as BMW, IKEA and Lufthansa. They have also done projects for the Swedish government in the past. \n\n5 Tiers of Land:\nApartment (3000 units)\nDuplex (900 units)\nCondo (600 units)\nPenthouse (400 units)\nMansion (100 units)\n\nTotal Volume traded (Magic Eden): 96,030 SOL\n\nFollowing the sold-out Lux mint, Lux recorded the highest trading volumes on Magic Eden. Apartments were changing hands for 18-20 SOL (back when SOL was $200), and Penthouses were going for upwards of 70 SOL. I think a mansion got sold for 150 SOL. Current prices are as follows:\n\nApartment: 2 SOL\nDuplex: 3.79 SOL\nCondo: 4.8 SOL\nPenthouse: 12.79 SOL\nMansion: 54 SOL\n\nI propose the DAO purchases:\n\n1 x Mansion @54 SOL (which could be good advertising for the DAO - FTX has one, as do most leading Solana NFT projects). Stake for $Lux token\n\n6 x Penthouses under 20 SOL (FP goes up to 50 SOL after this). Stake for $Lux Token\n\nMax Expenditure: 174 SOL = $6,960 \n\nThe DAO could buy apartments, but I think the Penthouses will be more sought after, and if you can buy at 10-15 SOL, we should be able to make a 5X on them during the next bull run. A reference point should be Portals, which as a FP of 41 SOL for the most basic Ivory apartment, and 221 SOL for the mid tier Onyx. I also compare the real estate demos to Exclusible. \n\nThe staking rewards for real estate are as follows,  although the $LUX token price is yet to be established (it's pre IDO):\n\nApartment: 1000 $LUX per week\nDuplex: 1200 $LUX per week\nCondo: 1400 $LUX per week\nPenthouse: 1600 $LUX per week\nMansion: 2000 $LUX per week\n\nOne possible strategy would be to buy Lux Realestate pre the upcoming avatar mint, and sell during or after, if there is a pump. Another would be to buy and stake until the next bull run. I don't think prices will fall beneath current levels, and Solana is currently selling at a discount, which makes the real estate relatively cheap. During the next bull run the DAO could sell everything, or retain the Mansion as a presence / clubhouse in the Metaverse. \n\nOne of the main concerns I have had with Lux is their lack of decent marketing. I am assured that this will change soon, after the product is released. But other than that, it's a professional team that's focused on delivering results. They have frequent announcements on the Discord, and regular AMA's with Chris, the founder. \n    ",

I propose the following purchases (which can be adjusted by the team based on market conditions at the time of purchase): \n\nSuite x 5 (5 ETH)\nDen x 4 (1.6 ETH)\nHigh Rolla x 1 (3 ETH)\n\nWhy Burrows? \nBurrows were created by Fluf World in partnership with Beyond Games to offer a unique VR/AR experience. They have even partnered with Snoop Dogg to create a Snoop Burrow. Exquisitely crafted, each Burrow has an impeccable level of detail. There is already a working app on iPhone and Android to tour the Burrows. In addition to being personal hang out spaces, it has been hinted that Burrows will be necessary for Fluf breeding, which is speculated to begin in several weeks. It is also speculated that Burrows will be necessary to unlock Mycelium, the token that will be used within the Fluf ecosystem. \n\nLeaked high quality images of 3D Bored Apes have led many to wonder if Burrows will also become playgrounds for other NFT projects such as BAYC. Fluf World has taken an approach of fun first, aiming to design a metaverse that people will want to play in. With a max supply of just 10.5K Burrows, these are likely to be in high demand when their full use becomes revealed in the coming weeks and months.\n \n    ",

      "content": "[submitted by Skyfox]\n\nIntroduction:\n\nAt present there are several well established metaverses on the market (Sandbox, Decentraland, WWW3) which are very popular but they use outdated graphics. It is very likely that like with computer games, new generation metaverses with higher quality graphics and better physical models will replace older ones. One of such \"new generation\" metaverses is TCG World - which, however, has several advantages if compared to competition:\n\n1) Completion stage:\nAlpha version of the metaverse has been released and it is being currently tested (at present - by the team / moderators / real estate agents, in a couple of weeks access to the metaverse in testing regime should be given to land owners followed by general public shortly after than)\n\nFull release is expected in Q3 of this year.\n\n2) Graphics quality:\n\nAs one of the examples:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQhZWFYnMhk\n\nAs more people get access to Alpha version of the metaverse, I am sure there will be plenty videos on YouTube;\n\nCaution: do not make conclusion on the graphics quality based on the videos from the web site (and the web site itself) - it is outdated as of now since the team is focusing on completing the product itself.\n\n3) Variability\n\nTCG World has dedicated areas for a big variability of activites (racing track, entertainment zone, various gaming zones, etc) and conducts now negotiations with 3rd parties to fill these zones with content. This should attract big number of users with various needs, and hence stimulate increase of capitalization of the land in this project.\n\n--------------------\n\nThe land in TCG World:\n\nthere are several criteria how the land can be classified:\n1) size: silver (the smallest), gold, platinum, diamond\n2) purpose: farms (gamified mechanim for staking) and business\nThese land plots are sold on the market, with the larger plots already being sold out.\n\nAll the land plots above are sold for BNB.\n\nBesides that, there are commercial land plots. They are not put on the market and are sold to big players based on the negotiations with the TCG World team.\n\n----------------------\n\nProposal:\n\nto authorize leadership of TheLandDAO to :\n1) conduct negotiations with TCG World on acquisition of commercial and non-commercial land plots in TCG World; \n2) once negotiations are concluded, to submit a formal proposal for DAO voting with all the material details of the transaction agreed with TCG World.",

      "title": "NFT Worlds Genesis Avatars Usage ",
      "content": "Creator Discord Name: Capistrano #4651\n\nChoices to be voted on: The choice to vote on in this proposal is to either keep and eventually stake the NFT Worlds Genesis Avatars or to use all or some of them in giveaways (if this option wins the majority of votes, their will need to be future votes to determine the logistics around how this is done)\n\nAsset detail: The 5 NFT Worlds Genesis Avatars currently minted and owned by the DAO (15,000 total supply, currently not revealed; URL: https://opensea.io/collection/nft-worlds-genesis-avatars)\n\nRationale: The motivation for this vote is to determine how the DAO utilizes our minted NFT Worlds Genesis Avatars. A brief summary of options and rationale is listed below:\n\n    Option 1, The case for keeping and staking) NFT Worlds is exceptionally positioned to bring current gamers into the Metaverse, due to their compatibility with Minecraft (140M monthly users). One of NFT Worlds' potential future income streams is via play to earn (p2e) games built on top of Worlds. There will also be a $wrld marketplace to facilitate \"frictionless buying, selling, and trading of NFT Worlds game-specific items,\" and staked NFT Worlds Genesis Avatars will receive 50% of the marketplace fees in perpetuity. This represents a great opportunity to create some passive income that will enhance the growth and long-term stability of the DAO. Established projects like Skuxxverse have minted all NFT Worlds Genesis Avatars and committed 100% of these future fee rewards to benefit holders.  This example represents a precedent of how respected projects in the space are utilizing NFT Worlds Genesis Avatars to benefit holders of their project.  In the DAO's specific case the future income would build up the treasury and the DAO could vote on how it is used (to buy land, to fund giveaways etc.).\n\n    Option 2, The case for giving away all or some of the 5 currently owned Avatars: Giveaways can be a useful tool in cultivating awareness of a project and engagement.  The Founder of the Land DAO has suggested this as an option, and some community members in Discord have expressed an interest in this outcome.  Selecting this option means that you likely believe there is a greater benefit to the DAO in using the NFT Worlds Genesis Avatars in giveaways than the long-term benefit of holding and staking.\n",

Giveaways can be an important tool in cultivating interest in a particular project, and charity is also a relevant factor that I value.  However the DAO's first responsibility is to maintaining the stability and steady growth of the the DAO.  Therefore I argue that giveaways should be done strategically, and through the DAO voting system that we have already established.

There will also be a $wrld marketplace to facilitate \"frictionless buying, selling, and trading of NFT Worlds game-specific items,\" and staked NFT Worlds Genesis Avatars will receive 50% of the marketplace fees in perpetuity.  This represents a great opportunity to create some passive income that will enhance the growth and long-term stability of the DAO. Given the lower price of whitelist mint vs. current secondary price or public mint price, the best value is to mint using whitelist passes.  If we do nothing after 24 hours (from 6:00pmPT/9:00pmET 5/4/22) the whitelist passes will be useless and have no value.\n\nPrice:\nThe whitelist pass mint price is .4 ETH\nThe public mint price will be a dutch auction starting at 1 ETH and ending at .4ETH.\n\nRecommended Action:\nUtilize each Whitelist pass that the DAO staking wallet receives to mint NFT Worlds Avatars at .4 ETH each.  Mint as many Avatars as we have whitelist passes (no more or less: this should equal the total number of NFT Worlds the DAO owns).  ",

      "title": "Setting a quorum",
      "content": "As seen in many other successful DAOs a quoruom (minimum requirement of Land for proposal to pass) is crucial. The main logic behind it is that people that are enthusiastic for a certain project will likely vote while someone who has not heard of the project and doesn't want to spend time researching it will likely not vote at all (or simply vote against). Setting a quorum helps avoiding  votes passing that are supported by very few and gives security to holders that random proposals won't be passed. This potentially also relieves our DAO Treasury Board as they would not have to worry about proposals with little interest. \n\nHistorically, the number of Land in proposals didn't exceed 250 very often, therefore I do not think that it makes sense to make the quorum higher at the moment.\n\nThe quorum can be included through a snapshot plugin, code is openly available in the official snapshot github repository \"snapshot-plugins\" (https://github.com/snapshot-labs/snapshot-plugins/blob/master/src/plugins/quorum/index.ts)\n\nThe quorum should be:",

My experience in the finance / investment industry tell me that it's time for us to start generating \"alpha\" in our investments\n\nContext & Rationale:\n\nMy current role has allowed me to dig deeper into the MetaFi (Finance in the Metaverse) industry and by so I had learnt that Metaverse Assets can serve not only as a nice piece of metaverse land where we can contruct (a non productive asset) but also a productive one, by renting the lands to worldwide brands, nft projects, galleries or by renting to gaming guilds. In both cases, receiving \"alpha\" in for of rent payments. I had talked with some people in the renting business and heard a landlord can make +10K US$ for renting a piece of land for a one week event\n\nMoreover, this assets can serve as collateral to take crypto loans in different Meta DeFi projects\n\nThose are opportunities I believe we as a DAO should analyze / take advantage so we can not only rely in the value increase our DAO vault by the increase of the NFT assets we hodl. Given the wild nature of the NFT sector, this can be a challenging taks.\n\nProposal:\n\nConsider, analyze and execute accordingly the different / alternatives monetizatiion strategies we can perform to generate yield in our assets\n\nThis proposal came together with the following proposal (Creation of the NFT Portfolio Manager Positions) as this will be the person I suggest can take charge of this,  also submitted for snapshot vote\n\n\n",

The proposal was supported by holders but was not implemented with a comment that it was lacking the details. Please find attached the templates of the following two reports:\n1) Report 1 - on financial position of our portfolio ;\n2) Report 2 - a summary of activity related to our DAO\n\nIn case you in principle agree with these reports, I would suggest to approve them as they are (Reports v.1). Would be glad to discuss them in more details in our Discord channel and make corresponding changes if any (we will separately approve them as Reports v.2).\n\n![Report 1 Template.JPG](ipfs://QmXghpCyJVHfoedYxBY8CkjGwMQpxfRPwnoVSQ5j71VcMe)\n\n\n![Report 2 Template.JPG](ipfs://QmcqWUS1QJZYJwZdBiWJ5GSw61JTBHnp7DECXfrDLArGK4)",

      "title": "Join the Board of Directors for MetaPals by Purchasing 50 MetaPals Metaverse Passes at a price not to exceed .12 each. ",
      "content": "Proposal: Join the Board of Directors for MetaPals by Purchasing 50 MetaPals Metaverse Passes at a price not to exceed .12 each. Total cost < 6 ETH + Gas.\n\n[I proposed this project during the pre-mint stage and it passed both rounds of voting but the team decided it would be better to wait until the collection launches on OS, so I now re-propose it]  \n\nI. What Is MetaPals: MetaPals is a project focused on building up land within the metaverse and creating interactive experiences which bring holders together therein. The founder of MetaPals, Nick Clifton (@thenickclifton) has been in the crypto space since 2011, he owns several BAYCs and is the largest landowner in the coveted fashion district in DCL holding more than 120 mostly-connected plots. See photos at the end of this proposal for samples of the work already completed on these plots. \n\nThe MetaPals Treasury also holds 4 connected Sandbox plots and recently acquired NFT World #6898. Currently, work is being done to build up a series of clubhouses on those plots access to which will be limited to MetaPals Metaverse Pass holders. Within those plots will be games and special promotions (first games drop by 4/29) which provide value to holders who visit and participate. Work Is also under way (designers and developers already hired) on two subsequent collections MetaPals DCL Wearables (April 2022) and MetaPals Avatars (Q3 2022) which will be playable as an Avatar in DCL.\n\nBy purchasing 50 MetaPals Passes we will also be eligible to mint 50 MetaPals Wearables Collections and 50 MetaPals Avatars at an approximate holder mint price of .0015 (<$5) each plus gas. \n\nII. Why Board of Directors: MetaPals is a community-run project and decisions are voted upon by large MetaPals holders. The largest holders are given spots on the MetaPals Board of Directors.  By joining the Board of Directors, we can have a impact on the future of the project including proposing leases of digital assets we own. This could allow us to make passive money through the land we already hold and otherwise would not be generating income. \n\nAdditionally, we will have information on which plots are being built on next, and we can leverage this knowledge to propose buys of specific nearby plots. As we know, the value of digital real estate is largely dependent upon the traffic through neighboring plots. \n\nIII. The Plan: If this proposal was to be acted upon today, we could acquire 50 MetaPals passes for <4 ETH however I have created this proposal to have a max total price of 6 eth + gas for two reasons. \n\n(1) As we know the proposal process takes some time and the market is volatile so I left a buffer so the team can act swiftly if, and when, this proposal passes;\n(2) MetaPals passes come in 5 rarities (Sapphire, Emerald, Ruby, Diamond, VIP) each of which grants successively greater clubhouse access and higher rarity editions of the subsequent collections. The higher proposed price gives the team the ability to shop passes at multiple rarity levels at their discretion. \n\nWhile many companies and individuals buy land in the metaverse, a shockingly small number of them focus on building up that land and making it a fun place to visit. MetaPals intends to change this and bring PARTICIPATION to these metaverses. By having a voice in MetaPals internal discussions we will be able to leverage our positions in digital real estate in several ways. At a time when buying blue chip assets is dangerous, we can enjoy the massive upside of future bull markets with little upfront cost. \n\nOS Link: https://opensea.io/collection/metapals-metaverse-pass/\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7j6vf6qR\n\nPhotos: \n1.\tMetaPals Roadmap https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/922974002404810782/959427503053742080/Roadmap_Full.png?width=2250&height=1229\n2.\tDCL Plots https://i.postimg.cc/q7ZbjL1T/DCL-LAND.png\n3.\tDCL Build Outs & Events \n\n\n![metaclub1.jpg](ipfs://QmPYadvCKEVwjgXvfJXqcejuJLyGvuyzCd6P6BjN5doqru)\n![metaclub2.jpg](ipfs://QmTsMoyhNhPNKWPmthxciEbwdDdRBZJkrym6SXgbDG8d7U)\n![Metaclub12.jpg](ipfs://QmceLHrWHakWCQMSWSefLgzxb6zRbifSaLgLRex2fcR8aP)\n![metaclub13.jpg](ipfs://QmRfwF2VopfnMMVvB5PuVwyqTbhkvyVvAEDHfQazP1tTXL)",

      "title": "Buy up to 35 ETH of Otherside Land (BAYC) by Yuga Labs",
      "content": "Proposal by @WarriorMama#6315\n\nProposed purchase: Up to 35 ETH of land parcels in Bored Ape Yacht Club‚Äôs (BAYC) upcoming Otherside metaverse.  \n\nSpecifics: \n1) If the public sale is in $APE, this proposal would authorize LandDAO to convert up to 5 ETH into $APE to attempt to mint via the initial public sale.  Any unused $APE could be held or sold at a profit in a follow-up proposal.  \n\n2) For secondary sales, this proposal would authorize up to 20 ETH to be spent on Center Land (exclusive drop to BAYC holders) or Mid Land (exclusive drop to MAYC holders), and up to 10 ETH on Outer Rim land (available via WL to several communities such as Cool Cats, Toadz and WoW). Note: the exact names of these locations may change upon release of the final product.  \n\n3) Passage of this proposal would constitute a one-time over-ride of any prior LandDAO rules or restrictions on maximum spending or allocation for an individual project to allow for the significant investments proposed above.  \n \nAbout Otherside: We all know that BAYC is one of the most sought-after NFTs.  Teasers for ‚ÄúThe Otherside‚Äù present a metaverse that will provide a mind-blowing user experience.  There is speculation that Otherside land will be able to be ‚Äúmined‚Äù for resources, which can be sold for $APE coin.  These land plots will correspond to real land in their game.  And there are new creatures that may come with this land, known as Kodas, though it is unclear how these will be distributed.  \n\nA leaked pitch deck reveals that Yuga Labs plans to include a total of 200,000 plots of land, and 30% of the first 100,000 plots will be distributed to existing BAYC and MAYC holders.  There are several other collections that qualify for whitelist and the rest will go for public sale.  There is some speculation that initial sales will be done in $APE rather than ETH, but this is unconfirmed.  If the public sale is in $APE, this proposal would authorize LANDDAO to convert up to 5 ETH into $APE to attempt to mint via the initial public sale.  \n\nWhile all NFT purchases are inherently speculative, many expect The Otherside to become a world-class metaverse experience with land that will sky-rocket in value as it gets built out.   If executed, this proposal provides a unique opportunity for LandDAO to purchase highly sought-after land which could be leveraged on social media to promote our project and significantly increase the value of our DAO.   \n![Otherside image.jpg](ipfs://QmbA5v47XenJTY1Y2q6cR1VY7Wh1RJXqubsSxrSDM7Q4hU)",

      "title": "Buy up to 30 parcels in XONE metaverse (max of 2 ETH in total)",
      "content": "Proposal by @WarriorMama#6315\n\nProposed purchase: up to 30 parcels of floor XONE NFT parcels at under mint price (max of 2 ETH total to be spent).  Proposal is for floor to be swept over then next 2 weeks at the lowest price under .11 ETH each, with the goal to pick up as many parcels as possible at .04-.08 ETH.  \n\nI believe these are significantly undervalued given their upcoming partnerships with Universal Music and close ties with Sony and Warner Music.  They are also working on a deal with an AR glasses company which plans to feature XONE as the primary example of what their glasses can do.  XONE would be included as a built-in app with their device.  XONES have already partnered with CryptoWalkers and Jurassic Punks to support their avatars to roam across the XONE metaverse.  \n\nAbout XONE:  XONE is a Web3 iOS social application that lets you create, discover, and share immersive 3D spaces. Think of each XONE parcel as the evolution of your social media profile. XONE focuses on building social spaces where you can voice and text chat, attend events, explore with avatars and much more. Their vision is to build the next evolution of social media and leverage their background in the music and entertainment industry to achieve scale. They already have a working app for iPhone and Android. \n\nThere will be 4 primary realms within the XONE map ‚Äì Jungle, Cloud, Underwater, and Desert ‚Äì for a total of 10K parcels.  For holders with one parcel of each realm, a 4th Mystery realm will be available to mint. \n\nIntegration with other Metaverse land: Today XONE can integrate easily with other browser-based platforms by integrating QR codes in existing platforms. Scanning a QR code with a phone on a desktop browser launches XONE in the palm of your hand. Each XONE can be fully customized according to the holder's preferences. Several community members are planning to use these features to create branded spaces and host events. \n\nSince launch, XONEs have sold for an average of .23 ETH.  At a floor of around .04 ETH, there is a lot of room for profit down the road as brand partnerships become publicized and promoted.  They are about to launch a big marketing campaign and will be releasing a customizable version of their XONE app this Summer.  Now is a great time to get in on this undervalued project.  \n\nLinks: \nhttps://xone.gg/\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/xones",

      "title": "Investments in Netvrk metaverse",
      "content": "We already made our first investment in Netvrk metaverse some time ago by acquiring a Giant land plot in Education district of Netvrk metaverse. I believe that now could be a good opportunity to use current dip in market prices to increase our holdings in Netvrk metaverse, as well as diversify our investments in this metaverse.\n\nSummary of how the Netvrk world is structured: \n\n1) the world is divided into 5 districts:\n- business; \n- education;\n- creative; \n- entertainment;\n- adult.\nThere is no any clear definition or strict rules for which purposes land plots in each district could be used, but it is believed that the users of the land will build 'clusters' of their virtual businesses according to this description. There is information that only Adult district will have some regulations. Among the owners of the land there are discussions that Business and Adult districts could have higher valuations once the metaverse is launched.\n\n2) Sizes of the land plots:\n- Mega (62.5 thousand sq.m.);\n- Giant (20.0 thousand sq.m.);\n- Large (10.0 thousand sq.m.);\n- Medium (5.0 thousand sq.m.);\n- Standard (0.625 thousand sq.m.).\nPricewise, Standard land looks somewhat overpriced relative to other sizes, Medium and Large land plots look like very good deals at the moment, Giant and Mega due to their relative scarcity could offer interesting exit opportunities.\n\nBesides land plots, the metaverse offers Avatars, Transport and Bonus   Pack. Out of these additional assets the last item has particular value for our project since it provides unlimited access to resources / materials  needed to build on virtual land in Netvrk metaverse; it was also issued in limited volume of 2,000 pieces (although 15,000 land plots are planned in Netvrk metaverse).\n\nOther current information on the project:\n- the team is fully doxxed;\n- the project regularly generates new partnerships;\n- release of an updated whitepaper was announced recently, however, looks like there are some delays with its releases: (+)creates down preassure on prices, but (-) are there any real risks with the project?.\n\nProposal:\nTo build a diversified portfolio of assets in this metaverse which would  include:\n1) Six Medium land plots - 2 in business, 2 in adult and 2 in any other three districts, ideally closer to the center / portals (square purple plots on the map), with the price not more than ETH 2.0 per plot.\n2) Three Large land plots - 1 in business, 1 in adult and 1 in any of the other three districts, ideally closer to the center / portals, with the price not more than ETH 3.5 per plot.\n4)  One Mega Bonus Pack, at a price not more than ETH 0.65 (current FP = 0.45 ETH) - could be extremely helpful if we decide to build in this metaverse ourselves or to resell it at a later stage.\n",

Because every community has leaders and they have to be the first example to follow.\nI thought about a Discord reorganisation, we can add some new Discord's section to make easier for holders to see new proposals, closed proposal and to talk about it to have comparison and some comment on that!\nWe need also Language Chat to help people with english problem to be part of the family anyway!\nSo i thought something like that:\n\n-INFO-\n¬∑ Discord\n¬∑ Twitter\n¬∑ And so on..\n\n-WELCOME-\n¬∑ Rules\n¬∑ (Clearer) FAQ\n¬∑ Official Links\n¬∑ Meet the Team\n¬∑ Roadmap\n¬∑ Collabland\n\n-UPDATE-\n¬∑ Announcements\n¬∑ Tweets\n¬∑ Giveaways (for Holders only?)\n¬∑ New/Closed Proposals\n¬∑ New Purchases\n\n-GENERAL-\n¬∑ Chat\n¬∑ Trade\n¬∑ Help\n\n-HOLDERS/GENESIS-\n¬∑ Holder Chat (no need to be split with Genesi imo, we are a family)\n¬∑ Proposal Discussion\n¬∑ Collab Suggestion\n\n-LANGUAGES-\n¬∑ French\n¬∑ Italian\n¬∑ So on...\n\nI think this is our first step to try to involve the community.\nIf this proposal will be approved by you guys, and i see your interest, im gonna do a second proposal with new ideas!\n\nBig HUG!",

At the moment, $MET has a value of 9 cents per token, and Metroverse plots earn 200-400 $MET tokens per day (possibly more if you own land plots with the right synergies). \n\nFuture blocks will be mintable with $MET. Their new collection is minting on March 22nd, which would introduce more land into the supply, so shortly after that seems like it might be the best time to buy. The floor at the time of this post is 1.68 Eth. \n\nFor our purposes, $MET tokens could be used to mint future collections and increase our holdings, or the token could be rewarded to holders. I think the appropriate number to buy could be better decided in the final proposal. ",

      "title": "Join the Board of Directors for MetaPals Clubhouse by Purchasing 50 Cat Bricks Clubhouse NFTs at a price not to exceed .08 each",
      "content": "\n\nProposal: Join the Board of Directors for MetaPals Clubhouse (‚ÄúMetaPals‚Äù) by Purchasing 50 Cat Bricks Clubhouse (‚ÄúCBC‚Äù) NFTs at a price not to exceed .08 each. Total Cost 4 ETH + Gas. \n\nA. Why MetaPals: \n\nMetaPals owns land in Sandbox and a sizable plot in DCL. They are actively hiring builders to construct clubhouses (think fraternity houses) on that land. Events and games will take place in those clubhouses which will generate passive income for MetaPals holders. By joining the Board of Directors we can propose leases of digital assets we own. Essentially allowing MetaPals to build up our land while we receive a split of the profits. This allows us to make passive money through the land we already hold and otherwise would not be generating income. \nAdditionally, by knowing which plots of land are being built up next, The Land Dao will have inside information which we can leverage by buying up adjacent plots. As we know, the value of digital real estate is largely dependent upon the traffic through nearby plots.\n\nB. Background:\n\nCBC was a project that combined feline facial features with block bodies. The original team rugged the project a month or so ago. The community voted on procession plans and all community assets (treasury, eth reserves, gallery) were transferred over to Nick Clifton (@thenickclifton). Nick is a BAYC holder who is doxed and lives in Ohio.  Two weeks ago, the collection was removed from Opensea due to a DCMA claim from the Lego Group. \n\nAt that point plans were executed to rebrand the project into MetaPals. That process is ongoing. This morning the discord channel and twitter account both transitioned. The community assets (~140eth) are now being allocated for three purposes: \n\n1. Developing digital real estate by creating profit-generating clubhouses for partnered NFT projects in various metaverses. \n2. Designing a new collection of walking NFT avatars compatible with DCL, and Sandbox. Creating sets of wearable traits allowing customization of those avatars.\n3. Airdropping these new assets into the wallets of every holder of CBC on a 1-1 basis. \n\nC. The Plan\n\nBy purchasing CBC assets on LooksRare and x2y2 marketplaces we can essentially mint into MetaPals at an extremely low price-point. By owning 50 CBCs we not only will receive 50 MetaPals airdropped into our wallet, but we will acquire a seat on MetaPals‚Äô Board of Directors. By having a voice in MetaPals internal discussions we will be able to leverage our positions in digital real estate in several ways. At a time when buying blue chip assets is dangerous, we can enjoy the massive upside of future bull markets with little upfront cost while positioning up to profit from our current assets.\n\nD.

We can spend x amount eth on marketing. This are all ideas on how to become a more known DAO and Brand. We need to take our chance, we are still so early in this space and can achieve so much. My proposal is for the team to take this serious and start making moves such as marketing, twitter spaces and much more.

Through this entity, the community will pass on discord initiatives with DAO approval so they may be executed upon.\n\nThe Community Board would be comprised of 8 members; 4 Team Members selected by the team and 4 Discord Members selected from the community.\n*This is an unpaid position. \n\nBoard Responsibilities\nThe Community Board will be responsible for the following:\n\nExecuting community and discord-related initiatives that have successfully been approved by the DAO.\n*Initiatives requiring any Funds from the DAO treasury wallet will need Treasury Board approval as well.   \nIdentifying areas of improvement and submitting proposals for DAO Voting \nCreating, submitting, and orchestrating community events, giveaways, and other discord-related activities approved through DAO voting\n\nIf Proposal for Community Board is approved, the Team will post an #Announcement inviting members of the community to nominate themselves or other community members to fill the 4 Community Member Positions. \nThere will be a 5-day period to submit nominations.  After the submission deadline has passed the Team will then select 10 members of the community who received the greatest number of nominations and submit a proposal for each member for DAO voting. The 4 members with the highest votes will be elected to the Community Board and be given the Discord Role of Community Board Member.\n\nIn the event a community-elected Board Member must step down the remaining board members will nominate and submit replacement board member for DAO voting\n",

Each can be customized and engaged via desktop, XBOX, PS5 & virtual reality.  \n\nProudly built on NFT Worlds and the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAn open metaverse welcomes you home.\"\n\nWhy Is It Good to Own a Parcel?\nParcel passes entitle the holder to a parcel of land, distributions of $WRLD token, and a reservation for one of their Masterplan communities.\nRead the full whitepaper here: https://whitepaper.whitesands.game/white-sands/welcome/welcome-to-white-sands\n\nThis proposal is two-fold:\n1. Assign community manager to work hard on getting a whitelist spot for a White Sands parcel. If they are able to obtain, the purchase price of the parcel will be 0.5 eth, which will need to be funded by the DAO.\n\n2. Preapprove funds to be able to buy a White Sands parcel pass on secondary. In addition to obtaining a pass via whitelist, we propose the DAO preapprove funding of up-to 5 eth for the purchase of a parcel pass on secondary. The reason for the pre-approval is because the demand is expected to be extreme, and therefore the team will need to move expeditiously in purchasing a parcel pass without need for another vote.  ",
