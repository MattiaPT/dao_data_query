The arrests of Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev are considered a direct attack on the open-source development space and may have devastating consequences for developers who write and publish code.\n\nThe outcome of Alexey and Roman‚Äôs upcoming 2024 trials will set precedents for privacy in web3 and the freedom to publish code without fear of government persecution. Roman and Alex need your help to build a strong defense not just for their sake, but for crypto users and developers worldwide. In response to the arrests, a group of sympathizers came together to form WeWantJusticeDAO to advocate on their behalf and help raise funds for legal defense. However, time and money are running out, and we need your support.\n\nComplete breakdown of associated funding and costs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P69NhyLshI6kwfo7KqaA_rNUV5vpRw9JTJOfFAsdqAk/edit?usp=sharing\"\n\nView Roman's statement here: https://x.com/rstormsf/status/1749490246000238942\n \n![edward-snowden.png](ipfs://bafkreiaxad3xm53l53cnuroly7wtovqsranlpvzmkdwsuvogjf6qsx7sli)\n    \nThis proposal would donate 40 ETH (around $90K at current prices) via Juicebox towards support for Alexey and Roman's legal defense.\n\nNote: This proposal is being resubmitted due to low participation. After discussion, SharkDAO members have expressed interest in supporting Prop 493.",

Should even distribution of votes become unfeasible (currently prop lists 6 people), we will pragmatically allocate any remaining votes to those SharkDAO members who are nearest to winning.\n- **Current Member List for Allocation:** Maty, benbodhi, NounishProf, ccarella, Matascup, & Voadz. Please immediately flag any omissions or errors.\n\n**Action Needed:**\n- Vote below\n- Let me know if the member list needs to be amended.\n- Your prompt vote is crucial for timely participation! \n\nTY SHARKS",

      "content": "# LET‚ÄôS GET MAD (Meme Analysis Database + Proposer Pipeline Analytics)\n\n---\n\n*‚ÄúIs Nouns activity growing?‚Äù ‚ÄúWho is helping increase engagement and spreading the meme?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhich proposals are driving growth?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs our spend rate?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow many builders are contributing to the Nouns ecosystem?‚Äù ‚ÄúAre the amount of proposal candidates increasing?‚Äù*\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\nThere are a lot of questions that the Nouns community needs data support on. We want to create a database that helps anyone answer these questions, and an example website on top to support a first analysis: *What is the proposer pipeline and how can Nouns best support builders?*\n\nThe database will integrate activity across social channels and highlight which Nouns, advocates, and proposals have best supported the Noun‚Äôs meme propagation. Our data wrangling creative motto is: *Track Memes, Not (just) People.*\n\nAs a starting point, this work will gather the following data: [1] **onchain** activity (supported by the Nouns subgraph) and [2] two sources of social media (**Farcaster** and **Instagram**). This data will be available for others to query and use to investigate additional questions.\n\nWithin the scope of the work, we will also create a basic website including [3] a limited set of **general metrics** for context, and [4] **the first analysis website** focusing on the specific challenge of understanding the proposal conversion process. In this way, we will be the first ‚Äúapp analysis‚Äù built on the dataset.\n\n## Background\n\nAs of the moment, the Nouns‚Äô community and audience members produce a wide variety of data. Over time, more data is likely to migrate onchain (e.g. similar to vote comments today) and data will be produced across even more digital localities. The *United World of Nouns* will have a wide-ranging data footprint. Combining data across these localities can become a powerful tool for proposal development and decision-making.\n\nHowever, as @Krel mentioned in their [Request for Proposers](https://www.notion.so/94dadff999ac493b9902aa002e4b296e?pvs=21):\n\n> *‚ÄúNouns DAO does not have a reliable way to measure ‚Äògrowth‚Äô or ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô. Its not clear what should be measured, or what growth in the context of Nouns even means.‚Äù*\n> \n\nThis project will create an initial repository of activity growth combining onchain and offchain data. We are long overdue to experiment on this front!\n\n## Scope Overview\n\nThe Noun Pulse has two components: \n\n- [A] the open database and\n- [B] a single-purpose website with general metrics and a first analysis\n\nIn addition, we will include an analysis report explaining current trends, issues, and opportunities in the proposer pipeline.\n\nTo begin, we will include onchain data available in the Nouns Subgraph and two social media channels: Farcaster and Instagram. We will then publish a selection of core metrics that provide clarity to Noun holders and the wider community.\n\nMost importantly, the underlying data pool (Meme Activity Database) will serve a step towards a data-driven Nouns culture, which community members and potential builders can use to find opportunities for proposal submissions. This should enable builders to bypass building a new database. Instead, we can amend it, expand it, or fork it. As a result, we can focus our energy on answering new business questions.\n\nSuccess of this project will be measured based on **data pool connections** (e.g. external usage of the Meme Activity Database), **web usage** (unique visitors), and **discussions** or proposals that successfully reference the data.\n\nThis work will enable future analysis to include key derivative NFT projects (Gnars, LilNouns, cc0-lib) and other dominant social spaces (Discord, Discourse, X, Lens, etc).\n\n## Product Components\n\n![Components (1).png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkelSB-7p.png)\n\n### Meme Activity Database (a.k.a. The MAD)\n\nWe‚Äôve named the database the ‚ÄúMeme Activity Database.‚Äù The reason is that we don‚Äôt want to just track people; we want to track *********************************the content*********************************. Our ambition is that this database is an MVP aggregation of all-things Nouns, reliable **meme-data-as-a-service,** such that we can service a variety of new data-powered projects.\n\nAs mentioned, this database will be open source and free access: anyone should be able to contribute to it (e.g. add a new source or table) and build on top of that.\n\nAt the end of the day, we want to facilitate the use of data across the Nouns ecosystem. As the cc0 library enables media usage, the activity database enables tracking and impact analysis.\n\nThe Web API interface will be available publicly  distributed per specific sources (onchain Nouns, Farcaster, and others) as well as in aggregated form to enable the development of tools such as alerts, bots, and analytics dashboards.\n\nData will be synchronized in real-time directly from the Nouns‚Äô Subgraph, Farcaster, Instagram to an SQL database. The sync mechanism will be architected in a uniform adapter interface for easier future integration with other onchain data and offchain sources, such as Twitter, Discourse, Discord, Telegram, DeSo, and Lens.\n\n## The Noun Pulse Website: General Metrics\n\nWe believe that many Noun community members have a variety of needs. We will supply an overview of general metrics to serve as a source of truth for conversations.\n\nThese include:\n\n**Example Onchain Metrics, Supporting Clarity on Arbitrage**\n\n- Treasury\n- Treasury Usage Rate (Monthly Spend)\n- Burn Value\n- Estimated Burn Value at Next Fork\n- Average Auction Price\n- Current Arbitrage Opportunity (3-day average auction price minus value at next fork)\n- Count of Unique Holders\n- Count of Active Holders (Unique Holders with Vote w/ Reason in past 30 days)\n\n**Example Proposer Pipeline Metrics, Supporting Clarity in Builder Ecosystem**\n\n- Proposer Pipeline (with addresses and available contact information, details in next section)\n- Conversion Rates from Stage to Stage\n- Excerpts of Builder Stories\n- Count of Prop House Submissions\n- Count and % of Prop House Submissions from New Builders\n- Count and % of Passes Prop House Submissions\n- Count of Candidates\n- Count and % of Candidates from New Builders\n- Count and % of Candidates converting to Onchain Proposals\n- Count of Proposals\n- Count and % of Proposals from New Builders\n- Count and % of Passed Proposals\n- Count of Unique Proposers\n- Count of Unique Funded Builders\n- Growth in Onchain Comments\n    - Growth in Candidate Feedback\n    - Growth in Prop Vote with Reason\n    - Growth in Prop Updates\n\n**Example Offchain Metrics, Supporting Clarity in Nouns Reach**\n\n- Number of Posts\n- Total Engagement (Likes+Comments+Shares)\n- Engagement Rate (Ratio of Engagement to Posts)\n- Most Engaged Content\n- Total Followers\n- Total Followers with Onchain Identity\n- Follower Growth Rate (Updated based on API opportunity)\n\n***Representative Image of General Metrics***\n\nThe design for the website will use assets from the cc0 library and default Noun design parameters from the main website noun.wtf\n\n![Screenshot 2023-11-02 at 16.52.43.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyTCrHWm6.png)\n\n## Alpha Analysis Report: The Proposer Pipeline\n\nThe first iteration of the database will be focused to help address a key opportunity in the Nouns DAO: **attracting, shepherding, and retaining quality builders**. The data we select and analyze will be guided by this problem statement.\n\n### **Analysis Context and Design**\n\nEvery DAO has a funnel of builder activity. In the case of Nouns, we can roughly organize the participation process as:\n\n![Proposer Journey Graphic (1).png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H10ZHHWQT.png)\n\n1. Aware (Saw Nouns)\n2. Curious (Engaged with Nouns, Offchain)\n3. Audience (Engaged with Nouns, Onchain)\n4. Voter (Vote with Reason)\n5. Prop House Submitter (Submitted to the Garden)\n6. Prop House Funded (Proposal Passed)\n7. Candidate (Submitted Candidate Proposal)\n8. Onchain Proposer (Submitted Onchain Proposal)\n9. Funded Builder (Proposal Passed)\n10. Committed Builder (Completed Proposal)\n11. Multi-Proposal Builder (Multiple Proposals Passed)\n\n---\n\nHowever, we currently don‚Äôt have clarity on the people involved throughout this proposal process, or where Nouns can focus on to coach builders and retain them. \n\nAs Noun40 describes in this proposal‚Äôs feedback, there are many open questions. \n\nSome of ours include:\n\n- How many of the candidate props are from net new ppl?\n- Of the net new ppl, do their candidate props grow to be full props that pass (success cases)\n- How did those prop builders find us? (number will be so small you could just ask them)\n    - *Note: We will document stories where data is not available*\n- What is the number of ppl that commented on the candidate proposal?\n- Is that quantity and participant of candidate feedback growing?\n- Are prop house builders in the garden round then submitting candidate proposals? If not, why?\n- Are builders returning to submit new proposals? If not, why?\n\nAt the end of the day, ***‚Äúwe want more net new quality prop builders and we want them to have success and a low drop off rate.‚Äù (Noun40)***\n\nOur team would add: **we want those quality builders to come back.**\n\n---\n\nUsing this framework as a starting point, we can analyze the data, create different visuals, and validate the journey hypothesis. We understand this may not be trivial and some data or identity mapping may not be available. Data will be complimented with builder stories.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-11-02 at 16.50.42.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJFvSrbXT.png)\n\n### **Analysis Considerations**\n\nAs part of the deliverable, we will also include documented business rules underlying the analysis. For example, we will include what means if a builder is net-new. This is not necessarily trivial since we want to avoid counting an ethereum address as ‚Äúnet-new‚Äù if it‚Äôs the same builder but submitting an application with a new ethereum address.\n\nEach of these business rules will be discussed openly throughout the work to ensure the Noun community has opportunity to provide feedback.\n\n### **Analysis Outputs: A Written Report**\n\nCreating graphs and metrics is not enough for action. As a result, the scope of the analysis will include a **written report (In Notion or similar)** with recommendations. \n\nThe intention is to test out the usefulness of the database and the website ‚Äî to build for action. In this case, we will understand where the proposer pipeline issues are, support them with data, and provide tangible advice. \n\nFor example, insights may include ways to identify potential builders earlier, and help them find a Noun-sponsor prior to a candidate proposal submission; imagine if another group of Nouns community members (not just holders), offered to shepherd builders in the proposal process, similar to gardeners. \n\nThese insights will be framed as RFPs (**Request for Proposals**), such that the Nouns community has clearer direction on where to invest to strengthen the proposer pipeline.\n\n## Product Roadmap\n\nThe execution of this project will be done in an iterative fashion. By building in public and getting ongoing feedback, we can deliver what the community needs, and data that will support Nouns decisions.\n\n**Iterative Phases:**\n\n- **Phase 1:** Deliver alpha analysis plan outline and approach. Deliver mock-up UI for web application. Deliver database raw data components and MVP. Host open Q&A with Nouns (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 2:** Deliver basic UI w/ metrics. Deliver initial list of insights from analysis. Provide update on database. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 3:** Deliver UI updates. Deliver builder stories. Provide demo of database queries. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to gather community feedback.\n- **Phase 4:** Complete UI polishing and metrics calibration. Host open Q&A (e.g. via Aburra) to celebrate launch and discuss future analytics (where next?).\n\n## An Ambitious Vision\n\nThis project aims to uncover what ‚ÄúNouns-Native‚Äù analytics could look like, and what data infrastructure is necessary to feed this analytics into the broader Nouns governance and participation process.\n\nWe‚Äôre certain there will be other innovations along the way. After all, we need to address challenges in crossing the web3-to-web2 data pipeline chasm. Is it possible? We think so.\n\nFortunately, the team is not alone. They have a wide array of connections with governance leaders across the DAO space: Optimism, Purple, Forefront, Radworks, SeedClub, FWB, Cabin, and others.\n\nNouns is a place for ambitious ideas, and we are an ambitious team.\n\n## Team\n\nThis project will be led and executed by Rafa Fernandez (Farcaster: @rafa) and Rafi Gutkowski (Farcaster: @rafi). \n\n- Rafa Fernandez is a community architect with a focus on building [Digital Public Utilities](https://www.notion.so/General-Networks-e4615b9b52294f8bab34a82b47023d11?pvs=21). He has decade of experience in corporate analytics and studied materials-science and engineering. He is the founder of Folklore (Folklore.Institute), a community that curates and commissions research on digital cultures. Most recently, he was part of the Summer of Protocols research program looking at [online swarms](https://www.notion.so/41c114211ac045f087c44c16bd993748?pvs=21). Previous to the program he worked at Mirror where he worked in creator partnerships and community development.\n- Rafi Gutkowski is a software engineer and data scientist ([libred.org](https://libred.org/), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/rgutkowski)). He is building [Farway](http://farway.org), a Farcaster meta-client for social analytics. He started mining bitcoin in 2015 but only after exiting from his recent startup, did he double down on web3. Since then Rafi has been working on sementic analysis of decentralized social graphs, as well as creating web3-web2 bridges, such as Folklore‚Äôs web3-signature to feed [broadcast applet](https://www.no\n\n\n---\n\nTHIS PROP IS LONGER THAN THE MAX LENGTH FOR SNAPSHOT:\n\n Read the rest of the prop at https://nouns.wtf/vote/427",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 423 - Onchain Myth - Updated.",
      "content": "# Onchain Myth - Updated.\n\n## **TL;DR:** \nI'm creating a graphic novel for readers who like sci-fi, and fantasy, integrating blockchain concepts and Nouns in a web3 world. Distribution will be digital and physical. The project development will be shared through videos, live streams, and Open Editions, aiming for completion in 10-12 months.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE:**\nAfter some feedback I reduced the amount needed to execute this prop, just keeping strictly the necessary to make the graphic novel a reality and distribute it using the same methods. I have decreased the budget by 33%, going from 90 to 60 ETH, and swapped it to USDC.\n\n**About Noun 81:** I'm not including a txn to transfer the Noun inside the proposal.\nProf Werder is making a prop for that ([#421](https://nouns.wtf/vote/421)), I know it's a bit confusing, and it wasn't planned, but basically, if her prop passes I won't need an extra step to transfer the Noun, if not, I'll make a second prop to transfer the Noun to one of my wallets.\n\n---\n\n## **A Graphic Novel (Vol 1)**.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkNjEYyzT.png)\n*Draft Cover/Poster*\n\nI‚Äôm targeting Graphic Novel readers (15+) who love both sci-fi and fantasy + adventure, usually read action-packed stories, but also love tech, and (included but not limited) are crypto users. The artwork will include concepts related to decentralization, blockchain, and internet technologies, and Nouns will be the characters that inhabit this universe.\n\nI firmly believe that we can find the right audience in Web3 at first, it‚Äôs an amazing niche to build a tech-oriented story and ultimately an onchain mythology, in which Nouns could be not only at the core of it but represent great values and a positive-sum culture.\n\nTo me, nouns are not only pixel characters, but something more, they are storytelling vehicles full of potential. And at the same time, there are dozens of small elements in our community lore to include in the story. \n\n---\n\n## **Evolution of the Nouns aesthetics (from my POV):**\nWe all love the original Nouns, they are perfect as the source material, but they are also really adaptable to using them in different styles.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyPczHAWa.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ-R9gHga.png)\n*The last two images are from April-June 2022.*\n\n In this world-building adventure, I've given the term \"Noun\" a fresh perspective, digging into its meaning both on the surface and at a deeper, symbolic level. This project isn't just about testing how Nouns look; it's also about spinning an engaging tale. We want to hook current Noun fans and introduce new readers to our world, even if they're not blockchain or DAO experts.\n \n---\n\n## **Distribution:**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJE-Pclfa.png)\nDraft Cover.\n\n**Digital First:**\nThe main distribution strategy will be online (Free download from the website, manga/comic reader apps like Comixology, Viz Media, Kindle, and P2P/torrents).\nMost of the dedicated comic reader apps have more than 500K users minimum, but in the case of bigger apps like Comixology or Viz Media, they have millions of users combined in both the App Store and Google Store.\n\n**Physical:**\nPhysical copies will be handled through Amazon (highly efficient, global coverage, and no upfront costs). Plus, in case we can make a deal with regional publishers, it's easy to shut down the distribution of a translated version directly on Amazon.\n\n\n**2 Languages:**\nEnglish, Spanish. \n\nSince the previous prop didn't pass I'm just including 2 languages.\nWhy? Because I'm a native Spanish speaker and I usually make the story, script and most of the other elements in my own language, sure, I can use English to make everything but it's not the same and it's slower for me to work that way.\n\n---\n\n## **Concept Art:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJoFWSRZT.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJYtXrR-a.png)\n\n---\n## **Summary of the story (subject to changes):**\n\n\nMeet Shady, a Noun who doesn't quite fit the mold of an obedient or exemplary citizen in a world teeming with adventurers, mysteries, and high achievers. His existence is a quiet rebellion in a society that prizes conformity. However, it seems destiny, if it exists, has grander designs for Shady. His insatiable curiosity catapults him into the uncharted territories of unexplored worlds.\n\nAs Shady embarks on this enigmatic journey, it becomes clear that more than just his life is at stake. The fate of his entire kind rests on his shoulders, and time is of the essence. He's faced with a dilemma: will he seize this opportunity to change the course of history or let it slip through his fingers?\n\n\n\n## **Sample Pages**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryDRkBRWp.png)\n\n\n## **Characters from the first volume:**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bk-7xu1zp.png)\n\n**Featuring the NounBots:**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJVbJ9xza.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1nzkqeMa.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkRmycgM6.png)\n\n---\n\n## **Building in Public + Key Milestones:**\n\nI‚Äôm also building a graphic style to present the development of the project to the public in a more entertaining way using videos and/or live streams. This way people can follow more closely the development of the graphic novel and can ask questions about nouns and their ecosystem.\n\nThe goal is to make 2 videos per week, showing the process of the Graphic Novel, the idea is to use Twitch/YouTube, or short format videos like TikTok/Instagram.\nI can also use propdates.wtf to show the latest news of the prop and the Manga channel in Farcaster.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyO0trwWa.png)\n*This is a sample of how the videos could look like*.\n\n## **Key Milestones:**\n\n**Concept and Team (Months 1-3):**\nDevelop the storyline and artistic style.\n\n**Production and Marketing (Months 4-10):**\nCreate the 64-page graphic novel while making the videos.\nImplement marketing and promotion strategies on online platforms.\n\n**Distribution and Launch (Month 11-12):**\nPlan and execute the distribution strategy for both digital and physical copies.\nOfficially launch the graphic novel, including online and potentially in-person events.\n\n**Audience Engagement and Public Building (Ongoing):**\nContinuously engage with the community on various platforms, and introduce the videos to make updates about the progress of the Graphic Novel.\n\n**Global Expansion and Future Planning (Ongoing):**\nStart the conversations with external publishers to get the graphic novel printed around the globe.\nEvaluate the project's performance and plan for the next chapters.\n\n---\n\n## **Scope and Budget**:\nSince this is a graphic novel of 64 pages I will need around 10 to 12 months to finish it.\nThe ideal deadline would be the next Nouniversary and I‚Äôll push myself and the team involved to do so, but I‚Äôm organizing the dates including all the team efforts and the standard timeframes to make the deadline more realistic so it could be released in October/November next year.\n\n---\n\n## **Budget Breakdown:**\n\n- **Preproduction - 7 eth**\n  - World Building\n  - Concept art \n  - Environment design\n  - Character Sheets\n  - Props Design \n- **Script - 7 eth**\n- **Art Development - 29 eth**\n  - Layouts - 6 eth\n  - Pencils - 8 eth\n  - Inks + Screentones - 11 eth\n  - Lettering + VFX/SFX - 4 eth\n- **Editorial - 4 eth**\n  - Proofreading and formatting for Spanish* and English.\n*Spanish is added because I'm writing this in my native language.\n- **Marketing and Distribution - 6 eth**\n  - Distribution through the mentioned apps and websites.\n  - Promoted content inside specialized comic websites/forums.\n  - Videos / Live Streams, to engage with the community.\n  - Web3 collectibles like Open Editions to promote the artwork.\n- **Management - 5 eth.**\n- **Website - 2 eth**\n### **Total= 60 ETH (USDC 107,750) + Noun 81**\n\n---\n\n## **It's a me, Messhup!**\nFor some of you who don't know me, let me introduce myself.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Syxp3uJfa.jpg)\n\nMy name is Messhup and I:\n* Coined the rubber hose style on Nouns [back in 2021](https://x.com/messhup/status/1468248915963265024?s=20).\n* Created the art for the [1st contest made by NounsDAO](https://x.com/undeadnoun22/status/1473463987014619138?s=20).\n* [Lost Nouns](https://lostnouns.wtf/) founding team (Onchain Nounish derivative).\n* Made the 1st Nouniversary artwork ([featured in Brave browser globally for 24H](https://x.com/messhup/status/1568715950307905539?s=20)).\n* Constructed a coloring book series ([100 days of Nouns](https://nounsense.xyz/)) in 6 months. around 260 copies sold, and 1300 downloads, which served as the main source for several contests and attracted more artists.\n* Sent the coloring books to [DesignerCon 2022](https://x.com/bigshottoyworks/status/1711235066720821657?s=20) and [Devcon Bogota](https://x.com/messhup/status/1573013727200305156?s=20).\n* Nouncil founding member ([POAP](https://x.com/messhup/status/1514437218370215938?s=20)).\n* Made [The MetaSquare](https://x.com/thenounsquare/status/1620013926049288192?s=20) for TNS.\n* Helped to raise [21+ ETH](https://juicebox.money/p/sharkfrens) to support a [Shark DAO core member](https://x.com/sharkdao/status/1487436616557809670?s=20).\n* Drew 26 covers for the [Noun O Talk podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/3zRdJbEHThDE8F5ODRnWMF).\n* Illustrated a NounsDAO banner for the [Coincenter dinner](https://x.com/apenoun/status/1535063255148003328?s=20).\n* Designed merch for a boat, pin, and tshirts for [Nouns at NFT NYC](https://x.com/fiveoceans_dev/status/1649095323988660224?s=20).\n* Created GGBot, and a current collaborator in Nouns Esports (more coming soon).\n* Made the art for [Keep Nouns Weird](https://x.com/keepnounsweird/status/1687503577667846144?s=20).\n* Created a Nounish collection called [Serial Collectors](https://opensea.io/collection/serialcollectors) (more to come).\n* Core member of [Nouns Amigos](https://x.com/NounsDAOAmigos/status/1668349764440825857?s=20) (spanish branch of Nouns)\n\n**Outside of Nouns:**\n* Collaborated with [Noadz](https://x.com/thenoadz/status/1550372389313122304?s=20) multiple times.\n* One of the first Nouns artwork in [another blockchain](https://x.com/NervosNetwork/status/1522231419921178625?s=20)*\n* Meme Seizer OE ([17K+ mints](https://opensea.io/collection/memeseizer-by-messhup)) + [Onchain narrative](https://opensea.io/collection/meme-seizer).\n* 1st Cryptoadz anniversary on Zora ([13,660+ mints](https://x.com/messhup/status/1569704877474848772?s=20)).\n* 1st Boneyversary OE ([4,700+ mints](https://opensea.io/collection/boneyversary)).\n* [POAP Checks](https://x.com/poapxyz/status/1623071331733364741?s=20) (1100+ mints in less than 2 hours).\n* Featured in the [NFT yearbook](https://x.com/nft_yearbook/status/1600486785582338049?s=20).\n* Worked with Bankless for 7 months as an illustrator.\n\nI also worked with Adidas, ExxonMobil, Penguin Random House, LEGO, and more to come.\n\nI have more than 10 years as an illustrator and I feel confident executing this project because I've been preparing this for around a year now, I'm here to stay, I'm aiming high with this prop, and I want to make an epic graphic novel that breaks into the mainstream media.

The act was also proactively done in a fashion that put DAO's interest first (forgoing compensation at the time given the environment hostile to funding such work pre-fork). \n\nEach of the six artists are passionate contributors in the noundry community and are likely amongst the most values-aligned contributors we have, making them welcome voters to add to the DAO. All of the artists were contacted to confirm excitement of this award and the added responsibility as a voter.\n\nIn addition to the above, 1 ETH is proposed to be sent to Solimander for the technical support provided for the Nouniversary art upgrade prop.

      "title": "Noun en Sc√®ne (aka Mise en Sc√®ne with Noun 'Muppets')",
      "content": "Full Prop Here: https://nouns.wtf/vote/371 (recommend clicking so you can see the images!)\n\nDescription\nSponsored through lil nouns DAO\n\nTL;DR\nCinematic stills from a television series that doesn't exist (yet!) starring Chip - a cookie Noun - and Benny - a rabbit Noun- in the surreal, funny and over-the-top adventures they find themselves on while trying to do good in the world.\n\n\n\n\nTELL YOU MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT? WHY OF COURSE!\nA single frame can tell an entire story. It can draw you in. Make you think. Send you tumbling towards what happens next‚Ä¶\n\n\n(let‚Äôs put some Noggles on Roger)\n\nIt‚Äôs what the best films do. I mean look at that Roger Rabbit still. What are Roger and Eddie looking at? What‚Äôs about to happen? And why are they handcuffed together?! Not to mention location, costumes, use of lighting or even the colors! There‚Äôs a palpable tension and curiosity in that single frame that makes us care.\n\nI want to bring that to a fun art project focused on a pair of Nouns - Chip and Benny - and their adventures in the - slightly (or sometimes very) heightened and over-the-top - world of ‚ÄòNoun en Sc√®ne‚Äô.\n\n\n\nThink of it as a cinematic one-shot storytelling project that takes our pixelated, digital little Nouns, turns them into real life ‚Äòmuppet‚Äô-like puppets and then throws them into film scenes with flesh and blood people.\n\n\n(cinematic scenes that make you ask questions and keep looking)\n\nEvery one-shot tosses our sweet, little Nouns into a new dramatic scene where they're forced to deal with the crazy situation they've gotten themselves into by trying to help or do a good deed for a random human they've met.\n\nAnd through these scenic moments, the world of Chip, Benny and the 'Noun en Sc√®ne' project will grow, evolve and hopefully become something people want to see more of!\n\n\n\nBy utilizing ‚Äòmuppet‚Äô-like characters mixed with real people and heightened, cinematically-lit scenes, the absurdity and beauty of life will become that much more stark, profound and hopefully very funny.\n\nTaking cues and paying homage to a variety of influences including Alex Prager, The Far Side, world cinema, the Kermitage Collection and many more, this project aims to utilize a couple Nouns to create captivating characters we just can‚Äôt get enough of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChip and Benny are just a couple innocent, little guys trying to help and do good in the world, but instead they keep finding themselves entangled in situations way beyond their depth.\n\n\n\nCOOL. SO WHAT‚ÄôS THE PLAN?\nThese shoots will be treated like an indie film production - the difference being that we are capturing single shots that tell full, rich stories while still requiring casting, makeup, lighting, location scouting/rentals, puppet styling etc.\n\nOn the casting front, while at first it will make sense to work with local working actors/models and friends, as the project gains traction and grows - or when I‚Äôm working on my next tv show - I think there is a fun way to bring known name actors into these scenes and add a whole other level of playfulness to the project.\n\nThe first step will be designing, modeling and manufacturing our Noun ‚Äòmuppets.‚Äô Luckily, I‚Äôve gotten a very exciting collaborator on board for this!\n\nPUPPET HEAP!\n\n\nPuppet Heap is a unique design and production studio specializing in storytelling through the creation of iconic characters for all sorts of media including film, television, advertising, theater, and new media. The company was founded by artist, designer, filmmaker, and teacher Paul Andrejco after observing the burgeoning pile of puppets that had accumulated in his Hoboken apartment back in the early ‚Äò90s. Now, just a few blocks away, Puppet Heap is home to teams of artists, designers, writers, and producers creating character based narratives for clients around the world including The Walt Disney Company, Sesame Workshop, and Nickelodeon. Puppet Heap has been entrusted with the care, maintenance, and creative support of the Muppets for Disney‚Äôs The Muppets Studio since 2006.\n\n\n(Puppet Heap team on set of Imagine Dragon's 'Radioactive')\n\nPuppet Heap loves the project - I nounspilled them - and will be joining to design and create the physical puppets of Chip and Benny. And as scale and scope continue to evolve in their journey (we have big plans), they‚Äôll be there, helping to tell their growing story - and all the other Nouns that come into play too.\n\n\nAWESOME! AND WHAT ABOUT ME?\nMy name is Chris Martin - not of Coldplay, sorry - and I‚Äôve been making independent, global film and television productions for a decade plus now - primarily in Korea.\n\n\n\nMost recently, I co-created, co-wrote, directed, showran,and EP‚Äôed 20 episodes of a show called 'Dramaworld' currently streaming on Amazon that stars well-known actors including Liv Hewson (‚ÄòYellowjackets‚Äô, ‚ÄòSanta Clarita Diet‚Äô), Brett Gray (‚ÄòI‚Äôm a Virgo‚Äô, ‚ÄòOn My Block‚Äô), Daniel Dae Kim (‚ÄòLost‚Äô, ‚ÄòHawaii 5-0‚Äô), Ha Jiwon (‚ÄòSecret Garden‚Äô) and K-pop star Henry Lau.\n\n\n\nWith everything I create, I try to lean into a playful, magical realist tone that‚Äôs grounded in heart, which is the kind of storytelling that I think is not only a perfect fit for Nouns, but also an incredible way to bring people into this journey of Chip and Benny as they go around trying to help.\n\nI love everything about Nouns - the ethos, the support for creative, weird projects, and did I mention the freakin‚Äô Noggles?! - and have been trying to figure out how I could do something creative that furthered that mission for quite awhile now.\n\nThen suddenly, while wandering around a street festival the other day, I saw this:\n\n\n\nAnd bingo! üí°\n\nThe idea for ‚ÄòNoun en Sc√®ne‚Äô landed fully formed in my brain! And I knew I had to make it a reality and see what it could eventually become!\n\nWHY SHOULD NOUNS FUND THIS?\nStorytelling is everything - always has been. And in a world where we are inundated with ‚Äòcontent‚Äô online, a playful, quirky and precise project like this will be a breath of fresh air to stand out against the noise.\n\nUtilizing photography as a medium and consistent characters as the subject will allow fans to come back, excited to see where the journey of Chip and Benny will lead and who they'll be trying to 'help' next.\n\nAnd by staging everything down to the last detail, each photographic story that comes out of ‚ÄòNoun en Sc√®ne‚Äô will simultaneously be a fine art piece, a Sunday (web)comic and continuous character development leading to a broader (and very Noun-curious) audience.\n\n\n\nAnd in the spirit of 'mint everything,' we are planning to utilize Zora to mint and document our progress - design sketches, scripts, behind the scenes, etc. It feels like a great way to document the process of creation and build something creative in public.\n\nSpeaking of creative, meet Benny!\nHere's Paul's initial design for Benny:\n\n\n\nArms and legs, oh my! With our puppets, we want to keep what makes Nouns distinct while adding a whole new flavor that brings them to life and gives them character.\n\nThe (mis)adventures of Chip and Benny\nBy creating empathy and connection with our two little Nouns through visual storytelling, the project will help spread Nouns and nounish-ness far and wide - just how Chip and Benny would want it.\n\n\n(One-shot example sketch - 'Chip and Benny Check for- AHHHHH!')\n\nAnd we plan to have this first leg of the project culminate in a fun droposal that takes Chip and Benny IRL in eye-catching ways (see below for a tease).\n\nTHE ASK AKA THE BUDGET\nWe want to propose a tight, but realistic budget that still allows us to execute this at the highest professional standards, so that we can first not only prove the concept, but create something that rivals the quality of anything you'd see in a high budget studio release.\n\nWe want to go above and beyond everyone‚Äôs expectations for what 'Noun en Sc√®ne' can be because seeing is believing and we think this initial batch of scenes will prove the potential of building out characters in a uniquely nounish way and make people want to see where we can go with Chip and Benny in the future.\n\nBUDGET:\n\n$40,000 USDC (2 puppets x $20,000 USDC/puppet) one-time cost for the design and fabrication of our ‚ÄòNoun Muppets‚Äô - this allows Puppet Heap to design, costume and build out Chip and Benny in their physical ‚Äòmuppet‚Äô-ish forms (to be used again and again as the project continues and evolves).\n$50,000 USDC production budget to shoot and finish 5 'one-shots' - this will be a fully crewed up shoot with actors, set design, hair & makeup etc. and the budget will be used to pay crew, rent equipment, secure locations, finish photos in post etc. (all the production related expenses)\nDetailed breakdown to give a general idea of how the funds will be used HERE\n1 NOUN post delivery (cookie head Noun 483) - A big reason I want to do this is to become a more active and involved part of the Nouns community so I can more fully participate and build together with other Nouners\nTOTAL BUDGET: $90,000 USDC + 1 NOUN (post delivery)\n\nTIMELINE\nUpon prop passing, we can make our puppets and be in production in approximately 2.5 months and aiming to have finished images ready ~1 month later.\n\nAll the while minting our progress and creative developments on Zora.\n\nFUTURE STEPS\nMy aim for is to use the project to develop the characters and story of these two best friends on their journey to help and do good - even if it always seems to go a little sideways - in a surprising novel and onchain way. 'Noun en Sc√®ne' as the first piece will allow us to capture surprising, fun and shareable bitesize stories, which hopefully utimately brings Nouns into the real(ish) world and helps people fall in love with Chip and Benny.\n\nWhich brings me back to the aforementioned droposal!\n\nWhat better way to drum up curiousity than a droposal to help take Chip and Benny IRL. More on üëá soon!\n\n\n(‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®'s on billboards?)\n\nPaul and I have a ton of fun ideas for where to take this and how to grow it, so we're looking forward to what we can achieve this go round while keeping our minds open to how it can be expanded (cough a full blown live-action series cough).\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and look forward to making the world a little more Noun-ish!\n\nTime for Chip and Benny to save the world. One good deed at a time!\n\nKeep Nouns weird.\n\n-Chris\n\nProposed Transactions\n0xd97bcd9f47cee35c0a9ec1dc40c1269afc9e8e1d.sendOrRegisterDebt(\n‚ÄÉnoun-en-scene.eth,\n‚ÄÉ90000000000\n)\nThis transaction sends 90,000 USDC to noun-en-scene.eth via the DAO's PayerContract.\n0x4f2acdc74f6941390d9b1804fabc3e780388cfe5.transfer(\n‚ÄÉ280.964153488818120799 ETH\n)\nThis transaction was automatically added to refill the TokenBuyer.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 363 - Bring a million shredders onchain",
      "content": "Full Prop Here: https://nouns.wtf/vote/363\n\nGnars proposes a strategic migration from Ethereum mainnet to Zora Network in our pursuit to bring a million shredders onchain. Since launching with 69 ETH over 16 months ago, we've evolved into a dynamic, Nounish DAO, empowering action sportspeople through communal funding, collective creation and shared proceeds.\n\nWe're primed to deploy the GNARS playbook (as depicted above) and integrate Nouns intimately into our subcultures, leveraging our Goodwill, Network, Advocacy, Releases, and Serendipity (hypercycle).\n\nüìù Skateboarding is frequently our illustrative example. However, our commitment to genuine engagement spans all subcultures we're a part of.\n\nüìå TLDR\n\n\nRequesting 200 ETH...\n\nTransition Gnars from Mainnet to Zora Network\nSecure operational funds for our core contributors\nAllocate a treasury for continuous park enhancements\nIntroduce intuitive onboarding with QR/NFC plaques\nEnhance Nouns' outreach with subculture expertise\n...to bring a million shredders onchain!\n\nüîç DYOR\n\n\nGnars at a glance...\n\nBrowse both our offchain (90) and onchain (9) proposals\nCurate That's Gnarly (337 creators) collectibles ($15.6k raised)\nView our pioneering first ever DAO released skate video part\nTom's Tuts on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok (10M+ views)\nEnjoy films by Nounish like this one, this one, or this one\nSurvey our Prop House and winners like this epic event\nBid in our ongoing auctions ahead of The Gnarving\nToggle the switch to see each Gnar's HD version\n...to do your own research.\n\nüõπ Background/Problem Statement\n\n\nüìù Cult classic > Corporate cringe. Movements > Marketing.\n\nSkateboarding and similar subcultures, despite their rise in popularity, grapple with commercial overreach and value retention. Some of the most pressing challenges include:\n\nCommercial Exploitation: Outside brands jumping into skateboarding often prioritise profit over authenticity.\nLoss of Authenticity: Many skaters, due to financial pressures, might promote brands they don't genuinely align with.\nSkater Exploitation: Many skaters, despite their talent, don't receive fair compensation, especially considering the sport's physical demands.\nMainstream Misrepresentation: Media portrayals frequently miss the genuine essence of skateboarding, leaning into stereotypes.\nSkatepark Commercialisation: Once-communal skateparks are becoming increasingly commercialised.\nCore Values vs. Growth: Balancing foundational skateboarding values with growth opportunities remains a delicate act.\nThe skateboarding domain needs a thoughtful equilibrium. Brands that genuinely get and respect the skate culture have the potential to collaboratively benefit both parties without diluting the sport's spirit.\n\nüí° Proposed Solution\n\n\nüìù Check out the Meier Skatepark renovation proposal that's currently being delivered\n\nEmpowering individuals to step into the blockchain world is central to our mission. Shredders, akin to artists, can undergo transformative experiences through this. Our overarching goal is to amplify our influence, simplify operational processes, and champion those with genuine grassroots credibility.\n\nGNARS as an acronym crystallizes our ethos, mirroring the Nouns' virtuous cycle, acting as our serendipity machine:\n\nGoodwill: Renewing skateparks and introducing new, shred-worthy sculptures\nNetwork: Culturally sensitive contributions earn us both visibility and respect\nAdvocacy: Harmonising with communities helps us draw in new enthusiasts\nReleases: Collective creative outputs with shared proceeds bolster funding\nSerendipity: Getting onchain empowers shredders, opening fresh avenues\nüåü Opportunity\n\n\nOur target of onboarding a million shredders might seem lofty, but it's just a fraction - 0.2% - of the 490 million participants in extreme sports.\n\nTo provide some perspective, skateboarding alone boasts 85 million participants. Industries like adventure tourism further validate our optimistic projections, given their sustained growth trajectories.\n\nüß≠ Approach and Strategy\n\n\nüìù Watch this NounGnarversary celebration funded via Prop House on YouTube\n\nGnars takes pride in our unique, community-focused contributions to skate culture. Here's how we plan to maximize our impact:\n\nLocal Council Engagement: Propose collaborations with councils, emphasising mutual benefits. Secure permissions for QR/NFC plaques.\nCommunity Consultation: Prioritise feedback, ensuring final outputs align with community needs and aspirations.\nSkateable Art: Commission designs that are both visually appealing and skateable, enhancing park functionality.\nSkate Community Collaborations: Organise events to spotlight our mission. Rope in local influencers as ambassadors.\nEducational Initiatives: Engage with schools and clubs, emphasising the interplay of art, skateboarding, and community projects.\nMedia Outreach: Use local media to showcase project completions and events, underscoring our tech integrations.\nFeedback Mechanisms: Use digital tools to gauge user engagement and gather feedback, refining future strategies.\nOur dual focus on the skateboarding community and local councils ensures that our initiatives resonate with authentic cultural value.\n\nüìä Budget Breakdown\n\n\nPer the TLDR, our ask is 200 ETH to our treausury (DAO executor) at gnars.eth, outlined as:\n\nContinuous park enhancements - 150 ETH\nSkate and other terrain park refurbishments globally\nShred-worthy Nouns themed sculpture fabrications\nInstalls of commemorative QR/NFC enabled plaques\nUnveiling and onboarding events fully documented\nReleases of all works onchain as paid or free mints\nAll mint proceeds split with creators and treasury\nBeing enabled by Nouns is core to Gnars' story\nAdministration of GNARS strategy - 42 ETH\nCoordinate community-driven promotional activities\nManage various Gnars Media House curatorial efforts\nOversee day to day operations and general administration\nExperiment with retro rewards (up to 2 ETH/month/contributor)\nCommunity discord moderation and shredder onboarding\nCollaborate with Rainbow wallet on QR / NFC activations\nDisburse free Gnars (10%) from multisig for shredders\nProvide assistance to our pods and working groups\nMigrate Gnars to Zora Network - 8 ETH\nAdd a timelock period/minimum quorum before new DAO opens up for props so nobody captures the first few props\nDeploy all contracts to Zora\nEdit frontend to integrate with Zora\nMigrate subgraph\nImplement gnars claiming process\nPlan for treasury migration\nComplete full migration\nüìù Through onchain governance we will allocate funds as earmarked and will be experimenting with Partitions for a holistic approach to treasury management. If you've any questions about the finer details, please don't hesitate to join our Discord for a discussion. We are here to help!\n\nü§ò Shred the Nouns\n\n\nIn the essence of our name and spirit, what we at Gnars do best is Shred the Nouns. Our passion extends beyond the conventional, morphing the iconic Nouns into tangible sculptures that echo our shared values and love for our sports, creating spaces where art meets action, and stories come alive beneath our wheels.\n\nAs we roll forward with our vision, we deeply value the collective strength and insights of the Nouns community. Your continued encouragement, feedback, and trust are what make such endeavors possible. By embracing our proposal, you're not just endorsing a project, but championing the blend of art, culture, and authenticity that both Nouns and Gnars represent.\n\n\n\nIn gratitude for your time and consideration, and as a gesture of our appreciation, we've created a unique, commemorative NFT to mark the submission of this proposal. For the month of Shredtember, we invite you to mint this FREE NFT and all Zora Protocol Rewards will be split between Nouns and Gnars treasuries. A special thank you for being an intrinsic part of our journey.\n\nYour voice matters. As we conclude, we earnestly encourage each member of the Nouns community to cast their vote with comment. Together, let's continue to reshape, reimagine, and literally Shred the Nouns.\n\nThank you for considering a future where passion, play, and purpose collide!\n\nBe sure to scroll our Twitter for all the latest happenings.\n\nSHRŒûD M‚ùçRE\n\n‚åê‚ó®ü§ò‚ó®\n\nProposed Transactions\n0xa1b74d2280966a89ac7e0f3a8bc5f0867c776d98.transfer(\n‚ÄÉ200.0 ETH\n)",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 356 - Nouns DAO V3 upgrade, including Nouns Fork (Will Not Cancel)",
      "content": "# Nouns DAO V3 upgrade, including Nouns Fork (Will Not Cancel)\nThis is more than an exact replica of Prop #354, which passed with near-unanimous approval only to be unexpectedly canceled by its owner before execution. This prop is a statement of resilience, a pledge that will not be broken or **canceled**.\n\nFinalized with meticulous care between January and February, V3's design stands unchanged. The community, blindsided by the spontaneous cancellation despite comprehensive legal opinions and exhaustive audits, remains united and vigilant. Claims of a \"crypto-economic issue\" find no echo among the community, auditors, Cayman Foundation's law firm, or the CT community at large. Yet, we should all stand ready for open discourse within the five days before this prop goes live. **This prop will not be canceled.** The community alone will decide, again.\n\nThis proposal symbolizes something profound. It is the very test of whether Nouns is controlled by the collective strength and wisdom of the community/token holders or controlled by a select few known as the Nounders/multisig holders. This is a moment that challenges us to prove our shared principles and uphold true decentralization while leading the ecosystm forward into a new more resilient future.\n\n\n------------------------- Below should be identical to the last prop. Please Verify -------------------------\n\n# Edit: changing stETH transfer (tx #6) to a lower amount in case proposal 352 passes\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal upgrades the Nouns DAO logic contract to V3. This version introduces the following changes:\n\nProposal editing: adding a new initial state to the proposal lifecycle: ‚ÄúUpdatable‚Äù, during which proposers can update their proposal's transactions and text description.\nThis feature will be disabled at first and will require a separate proposal to configure the period of the Updatable state.\nPropose by signatures: allowing Nouners and delegates to pool their voting power towards submitting a proposal, by submitting their signature, instead of the current approach where sponsors must delegate their votes to help a proposer achieve threshold.\nThis feature will be activated once this proposal executes.\nObjection-only period: a conditional voting period that gets activated upon a ‚Äúlast-minute‚Äù proposal swing from defeated to successful, affording voters more reaction time. Only against votes are possible during the objection period.\nThis feature will be disabled at first and will require a separate proposal to enable it and configure its parameters.\nVotes snapshot after voting delay: moving votes snapshot up, to provide Nouners with reaction time per proposal, to get their votes ready (e.g. some might want to move their delegations around). Currently the vote snapshot block is the proposal creation block.\nNouns Fork: allowing Nouners to exit the DAO by forking to a new DAO. Current threshold is set at 20%. For more details please read the tech spec and this post.\nAn updated version of nouns.wtf will be deployed to add support for these features.\n\nAudit\nThe DAO funded two audits for this version, first with Spearbit and then with code4rena.\nBelow is a summary of the results with links to the reports.\n\nPlease reach out to us (verbs team) if you have any questions regarding the findings.\n\nSpearbit found:\n\n0 critical risk severity issues\n2 high risk severity issues\n18 medium risk severity issues\n22 low risk severity issues\nFor more info: the full Spearbit audit report.\n\ncode4rena found:\n\n1 high risk finding\n3 medium risk findings\n8 low risk findings\nFor more info: the full code4rena audit report.\n\nWon‚Äôt Fix Issues\nThere were some issues we chose to not fix despite agreeing they were good findings, because we wanted to avoid adding further risk or time delays. We‚Äôre listing those here explicitly for the sake of max transparency. There were other issues we did not fix because we disagreed with the auditors‚Äô analysis, and those are not listed here.\n\nSetting a new fork escrow contract might lead to lost tokens\nProposals can move from Expired state back to Queued when timelock‚Äôs Grace Period changes\nChanges in detail\nProposal editing\nProposals get voter feedback almost entirely only once they are onchain. At the same time, proposers are reluctant to cancel and resubmit their proposals for multiple reasons, e.g. prefering to avoid restarting the proposal lifecycle and thus delay funding.\n\nThere have been cases where proposers made promises offchain, e.g. to return part of the funds, but that is not captured onchain, and not visible to the entire voter base.\n\nThis feature introduces a new state into the proposal lifecycle:\n\nUpdatable (new) ‚Üí Pending ‚Üí Active ‚Ä¶\nDuring the Updatable state, a proposer can update their proposal‚Äôs description and/or transactions. Following the Updatable state, there‚Äôs a Pending state during which updates are no longer available before voting starts during the Active state.\n\nThe length of the Updatable state is configurable by the DAO, and starts at zero. This effectively keeps the feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow with proposed periods for the state, for example: Updatable: 5 days, Pending: 1 day\n\nThere‚Äôs also an onchain method of providing feedback to proposals while they are in the Updatable state.\n\nPropose by signatures\nProposal threshold is the number of votes an account must control in order to submit a proposal. As of this writing an account must have at least 2 votes to pass the threshold.\n\nCurrent methods of sponsoring a proposal and their problems:\n\nNouners today either delegate their Nouns to proposers or submit the proposal on their behalf.\nDelegating is limited to Nouners, since delegates can re-delegate their vote to another account.\nWhen a Nouner delegates, they can‚Äôt use their voting power for the length of the proposal lifecycle which is very inconvenient.\n\nIf a Nouner/delegate chooses to submit a proposal on behalf of the proposer, we lose the meaning of who is the actual proposer and also the process itself can be cumbersome where the delegate needs to make sure the proposal looks good and pay gas for it.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new function to the DAO contract: proposeBySigs.\nThis allows anyone to submit a proposal and a set of signatures. The signatures are provided by voters and need to match the proposal content. If the sum of votes from all the signers surpasses proposal threshold, the proposal can be submitted.\n\nThe goal is to open another channel through which proposers can submit proposals, without necessarily finding a sponsor through private channels.\n\nVoters can only be signers if they don‚Äôt currently have an active proposal, either as a proposer or signer. Signers of a proposal can cancel it at any time, and the same is true for proposers; proposers should choose their signers carefully.\n\nThis allows both Nouners and delegates to ‚Äúsign-off‚Äù on a proposal, while the proposer address remains the actual proposer and without the need to change delegations.\nIt also allows pooling voting power, e.g. two delegates with 1 vote each can sign a proposal in order for it to pass the proposal threshold, currently at 2 votes.\nIt also opens the door to raising the proposal threshold since it‚Äôs easier to collect voting power.\n\nAs part of this update we are adding support for ‚Äúproposal candidates‚Äù to nouns.wtf, where proposers can submit their proposals and request signatures. In order to prevent spam, creating a candidate proposal requires either holding 1 vote or sending 0.1 ETH (the ETH recipient and the amount are configurable by the DAO).\nThe candidate proposals data are submitted to a side contract to make this data publicly available for any frontend to interact with.\n\nObjection-only period\nThe goal is to protect the DAO from executing proposals that the majority would not want to execute. The threat is one where a minority trying to pass a proposal can let the proposal look like it's failing, to cultivate voter apathy, then cast many of their For votes just before voting ends, swinging the proposal from defeated to successful, leaving the majority wishing they were more vigilant.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new state in the proposal lifecycle: ObjectionPeriod.\n\n‚Ä¶ Active (regular voting period) ‚Üí ObjectionPeriod (conditional) ‚Üí Succeeded / Defeated \\\nObjectionPeriod gets turned on only if a proposal turns from not passing to passing close enough to the end of the voting period.\n\nDuring the ObjectionPeriod state, only voters who haven‚Äôt voted yet are allowed to vote, but only against the proposal.\n\nQ: Why not allow voting For a proposal during this extra voting period?\nA: Similar to the attack scenario described above, it would still allow voters to keep their votes to themselves and vote only at the last minute. In this case it would be right before the ObjectionPeriod ends.\n\nMore broadly speaking, the risk that a proposal passes when it shouldn‚Äôt, is much higher than the risk of a proposal not passing when it should.\nA proposal can be re-proposed, but a proposal that passes can‚Äôt be reversed.\n\nDAO configurable parameters:\n\nobjectionPeriodDurationInBlocks: how long the objection period lasts, e.g. 2 days\nlastMinuteWindowInBlocks: what is considered ‚Äúlast minute‚Äù? e.g. 2 hours\nBoth parameters start with values of zero, effectively making this feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow turning on this feature with suggested parameters.\n\nVotes Snapshot After Voting Delay\nThe current DAO implementation takes a snapshot of votes & delegation at the block a proposal is created, meaning Nouners have no lead time to put their votes in order, e.g. moving their delegations back to themselves to vote on something they really care about.\n\nThis upgrade changes the snapshot to be after the voting delay, i.e. once voting starts. Nouners will now have the duration of voting delay to transfer, buy, sell, delegate and undelegate their votes.\n\nBecause the nouns supply grows during the voting delay, nouns that are minted during the voting delay also participate in voting. Originally the snapshot was taken during proposal creation in order to align the total supply and the quorum and proposal calculations, which are performed at proposal creation time. Now that the supply has grown, this inconsistency is insignificant.\n\nNouns Fork\nFurther details can be found here in the tech spec and this post.\n\nNew treasury\nThe DAO fork feature requires switching to a new treasury contract which allows the DAO to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens when a fork executes. The current treasury (treasury v1) contract is not upgradable, so it requires a migration to a new one. The new treasury (treasury v2), deployed at 0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71, adds the new functions to the existing contract, and is upgradable to avoid the need for migrations in the future.\n\nThe migration includes:\n\nTransferring ETH, stETH, wstETH, rETH & USDC\nChanging ownership of the auction house, auction house proxy admin, nouns token & nouns descriptor contracts\nChange ownership of TokenBuyer and Payer to allow treasury v2 to perform ETH/USDC swaps\nApprove the treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\nOther assets in treasury v1 can be moved or approved to be moved in follow up proposals. Only assets in treasury v2 are included in the treasury forking in case of a fork.\n\nDAO proposals are limited to 10 transactions, therefore we are doing the migration in two steps. There will be a follow up proposal with the second part of the migration. The follow up proposal will go onchain once this one executes.\n\nThe DAO will still have access to the original treasury (treasury v1), by proposing proposals via the proposeOnTimelockV1 function.\n\nExisting streams created by the DAO will remain controlled by treasury v1. If the DAO chooses to cancel them, the proposeOnTimelockV1 function will need to be used.\n\nImportant heads up\nProposals that are queued but not yet executed before this proposal executes will need to be executed using the executeOnTimelockV1 function. The regular execute function will attempt to execute via treasury v2 and will fail.\n\nProposal #1 Transactions (this proposal):\nSend 2,500 ETH to new treasury contract\nThe rest of the ETH will be transferred in a followup proposal. We can‚Äôt tell in advance how much ETH the treasury will have at the moment this proposal executes so we are sending a first chunk now.\nUpgrade the DAO contract logic to V3\nSet the fork params:\na. forkEscrow: the escrow contract\nb. forkDeployer: the contract which deploys new forked DAOs\nc. erc20TokensToIncludeInFork: addresses of erc20 tokens which will be included in the treasury fork, specifically: stETH, wstETH, rETH and USDC\nd. forkPeriod: the period during which token holders can join a fork after it has been executed, 7 days\ne. forkThresholdBPS: the % of nouns required to surpass in order to activate a fork, 2,000 bps = 20%\nSet the proposal id at which the vote snapshot will be changed to be after voting delay\na. Sets it to the next proposal after the current one\nTransfer ownership of the auction house proxy contract\nSend stETH to the new treasury, leaving 5,000 stETH for proposals that may be queued\nChange ownership of the Nouns token contract\nChange ownership of the Nouns descriptor contract\nTransfer ownership of the auction house proxy admin\nSet treasury V2 as the new treasury of the DAO contract, and set treasury v1 to be available to reference for proposeOnTimelockV1\nProposal #2 Transactions:\nThis proposal will be submitted only after the first one executes, since only then we will know the final amount of ETH in treasury V1 to transfer as part of this proposal.\n\nMove leftover ETH from treasury v1 to treasury v2\nApprove treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\nTransfer ownership of TokenBuyer to treasury v2\nTransfer ownership of Payer to treasury v2\nApprove unlimited stETH to be transferred by the ERC20Transferer contract\nInvoke ERC20Transferer to send remaining stETH \n\n\n---\n\nTHIS PROP IS LONGER THAN THE MAX LENGTH FOR SNAPSHOT:\n\n Read the rest of the prop at https://nouns.wtf/vote/356",

The event bring together developers, creators, and newcomers to nurture future talent within the Ethereum space.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dvPOIxG.png)\n\nThe event will be held at the prestigious [National Gallery of Singapore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TA_l7kphVdA), encompassing a hackathon focused on real-world challenges from local non-profit organizations and social enterprises.The conference will also feature community hubs inspired by Devcon VI's format, offering high-quality programming and prominent speakers such as Vitalik, Aya Miyaguchi, Ed Felten from Arbitrum, Alex Guchowski from zksync, and more!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJQdXETqh.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkV68L2q2.png)\n\n# **Ethereum Singapore is Nounish**\n\n\n# **Fund Breakdown:**\n**1. Retroactively supporting 4 workshops with the National Volunteer and Philantrophy Centre of Singapore and providing a Nounish presence at the Ethereum Singapore conference - 15,000 USDC**\n\nThe [National Volunteer and Philantrophy Centre](https://cityofgood.sg/) work with 2,000 charities and non-profits in Singapore and have come on board as a partner for the hackathon. 4 workshops have been run together with them engaging 40 non-profits as we educate them on Web3. The workshops were:\n1. Crash course on Web3 for non-profit organisations\n2. Using Web3 for NPOs - when, where, how?\n3. Hands-on workshop - setting up an ENS, demo on QF with clrfund\n4. Road to Ethereum SG: Defining Challenge Statements\n\nThe final workshop led to challenge statements being generated for Ethereum Singapore. Furthermore, this process will be thoroughly documented and disseminated as an **open-source playbook**, serving as a public good empowering other communities globally where they are able to freely utilize the hackathon format as a guide.\n\nAt Ethereum Singapore, we are breaking from the norm of using booths to showcase Nouns. Instead, the **entire venue** will be transformed into an **immersive playground for Nouns**, allowing event guests to fully engage with the world of Nouns throughout their visit. This fresh approach offers abundant photo opportunities and generates brand awareness as well as online attention as guests share their experiences on social media. We will feature Nouns as much as possible during the event including speaking and physical activations.\n\nWhat to expect:\n- 3D Nouns models all around the venue (ref. [Nouns fair](https://twitter.com/avee_eth/status/1683361931678064643?s=20))\n- Hackathon format released as a **open-source playbook**\n- Nouns discussion panel \n- Nouns logo (Noggle) placement on ETH Singapore Website\n- ETH Singapore social media recognition pre/post event\n- ETH Singapore post-event video produced by Angelhack\n- Event Staff/Volunteers wearing Noggle\n- Event ticket allocation\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SywCIVHsn.png)\n*3D Nouns all around the venue*\n\n**2. Hackathon Bounty - 5,000 USDC**\n- This bounty will be added to the hackathon prize pool for incentivizing more proliferation and public goods building. Bounty format will be similar to what was used by Nouns at previous EthGlobal hackathons.\n\n**3. Purchase of wearable Noggle - 1,600 USDC (including shipping & tax)**\n\nTo be worn by staff/volunteer/guest:\n- Classic (plastic) Noggles: 5 boxes of 10pcs/box at USD250/box\n- Lo-fi Paper Noggle (qty: 1000pcs): (Allocation from Prop #334)\n\n**4. Nounish activation - 6,000 USDC (including logistics)**\n  \nTo boost engagement and knowledge retention, we'll gamify the swag distribution process with a Nouns Questionnaire. Participants & Hackers will be challenged to find answers via NounsDAO webpage or socials. This interactive game aims to leave a impression and help participants remember what they learned about Nouns while winning themselves some Nounish swag. Proliferating with a purpose. Additionally, it helps drive traffic towards Nouns, increasing its prominence.\n\nA Mega Gachapon Machine (Nounified) will serve as the activation point.\nIt serves multiple purpose:\n\n- Brand awareness ‚Äì Earning Nounish swag; Noggel everywhere. \n- Learning ‚Äì  Questionnair game that foster curiously towards Nouns. Team will also be answering questions about all things Nounish.\n\nBreakdown for this section:\n- **Nouns X ETH Singapore Tshirt (Qty: 350)**: $4,200\n- **Nouns enamel pins (Qty: 150)**: $525\n- **Stickers (Qty: 1000)**: $200\n- **Mega Gachapon Machine Rental (Qty: 2 days)**: $425\n- **Logistics**: $650\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk9_JEBsh.png)\n\n**5. Run with Nouns Running Club**\n\nThe [Nouns Running Club](https://twitter.com/nounsrc) supports this proposal as it fosters a positive sum game by encouraging collaboration and growth. We are thrilled to share that the club has already initiated the planning of an official run alongside Ethereum Singapore. With the successful passing of this proposition, we believe that it will make a substantial contribution to the widespread adoption & visibility to Nouns Running Club powered by Nouns.  \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy79V8Rqh.png)\n\n# **Total = 27,600 USDC** to be sent to [ethereumsingapore.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/ethereumsingapore.eth)\n\n# **Motivation for Nouns to be at Ethereum Singapore**\n## 1. In true Nounish spirit, it is focused on public goods & non-profits\nThe spirit of bringing Web3 to enable real impact **deeply resonates with Nouns ethos**, where the very first proposal ever passed on NounsDAO was to [\"Donate 5 ETH each to 6 charities\"](https://nouns.wtf/vote/1) and also produced [public good structure like prop house to empower builders](https://nouns.center/funding). \n\nSimilarly at Ethereum Singapore we shared the same vision featuring a hackathon for good where the challenge statements will be [collaboratively developed](https://twitter.com/ethereum_sg/status/1676447827353018369?s=20) with local *charities and non-profit organizations* that have an interest in web3 technologies. Our collaborating partner [National Volunteer and Philantrophy Centre](https://cityofgood.sg/) which stewards the vision of making Singapore a City of Good will be working with thousands of local charities and non-profits engaging up to **50+ organisations at the leadership level** to educate them about blockchain technology bringing Web3 to them.   \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ7euU2c2.png)\n\n## 2. Southeast Asia presence + Devcon2024 will be in this region!\nThe team also aims to leverage this opportunity to effectively introduce Nouns to the local communities with the assistance of [@nounsinsg](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg), fostering greater awareness and comprehension of Nouns while leaving a memorable impact on Singapore, the blockchain hub of Southeast Asia.\nLooking ahead, all eyes will be on Southeast Asia as [Devcon is set to come the region](https://twitter.com/EFDevcon/status/1630543172974657538?cxt=HHwWhIC-gY-Y7aAtAAAA). Ethereum Singapore has [committed to dedicate its excess funds](https://mirror.xyz/ethereumsingapore.eth/MyMITRe0nHv1iqjx3jNxZtaq4M5d37wstODRkUCw-9k) to support local developers, events, education initiatves, and meaningful public goods for the region and hopes to set a new cultural norm for Ethereum events.\n\n## 3. A Nounish gathering point for our community\nEthereum Singapore is [held during F1 week](https://www.panewslab.com/zh_hk/token2049sideevents/index.html) which numerous events such as Token2049, Filecoin Summit, Froyoverse, NFT Asia, Milken Institute Asia Summit, and many more are held. Amidst the hectic non-stop event schedule, Nouns holders can feel at home at Ethereum Singapore with like-minded friends and our adopted web3 family members. The wider public interested in web3 can also learn about what we're all about and perhaps their first web3 interaction would be with a Nounish artifact!\n\n# **Executing Personnel:**\n[QZ:](https://twitter.com/not_qz) Main organiser and [meetup lead](https://www.meetup.com/ethereum-singapore/) for Ethereum Singapore. He works on building ecosystems by creating collaborative spaces across Web3 entities, governments, non-profits, and education institutions to help realise the potential of Web3 for positive outcomes. He worked at GitcoinDAO and helped set up the grassroots team and is now doing operations at clrfund too.\n\n\n[Pico:](https://www.pico.com/en/work?all_case=1) Pico has an extensive background in planning and executing major events such as [iLight Singapore](https://www.pico.com/en/work/i-light-singapore  ) and the [Youth Olympics Games](https://www.pico.com/en/work/first-ever-youth-olympic-games-in-singapore).

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 354 - Nouns DAO V3 upgrade, including Nouns Fork (edit)",
      "content": "# Nouns DAO V3 upgrade, including Nouns Fork (edit)\n\n\nEdit: changing stETH transfer (tx #6) to a lower amount in case proposal 352 passes\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal upgrades the Nouns DAO logic contract to V3. This version introduces the following changes:\n\n\n1. Proposal editing: adding a new initial state to the proposal lifecycle: ‚ÄúUpdatable‚Äù, during which proposers can update their proposal's transactions and text description. \n    * This feature will be disabled at first and will require a separate proposal to configure the period of the Updatable state.\n2. Propose by signatures: allowing Nouners and delegates to pool their voting power towards submitting a proposal, by submitting their signature, instead of the current approach where sponsors must delegate their votes to help a proposer achieve threshold.\n    * This feature will be activated once this proposal executes.\n3. Objection-only period: a conditional voting period that gets activated upon a ‚Äúlast-minute‚Äù proposal swing from defeated to successful, affording voters more reaction time. Only against votes are possible during the objection period.\n    * This feature will be disabled at first and will require a separate proposal to enable it and configure its parameters.\n4. Votes snapshot after voting delay: moving votes snapshot up, to provide Nouners with reaction time per proposal, to get their votes ready (e.g. some might want to move their delegations around). Currently the vote snapshot block is the proposal creation block.\n5. Nouns Fork: allowing Nouners to exit the DAO by forking to a new DAO. Current threshold is set at 20%. For more details please read [the tech spec](https://github.com/verbsteam/nouns-fork-spec/blob/main/spec.md) and [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/iN0FKOn_oYVBzlJkwPwK2mhzaeL8K2-W80u82F7fHj8).\n\nAn updated version of nouns.wtf will be deployed to add support for these features.\n\n\n## Audit\n\nThe DAO funded two audits for this version, first with Spearbit and then with code4rena.\nBelow is a summary of the results with links to the reports.\n\nPlease reach out to us (verbs team) if you have any questions regarding the findings.\n\nSpearbit found:\n* 0 critical risk severity issues\n* 2 high risk severity issues\n* 18 medium risk severity issues\n* 22 low risk severity issues\n\nFor more info: [the full Spearbit audit report](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/d417586ae46f8d32801a3028c2c3496b119fc032/packages/nouns-contracts/audits/dao%20v3%20-%20spearbit%20audit%20report.pdf).\n\ncode4rena found:\n* 1 high risk finding\n* 3 medium risk findings\n* 8 low risk findings\n\nFor more info: [the full code4rena audit report](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-07-nounsdao). \n\n\n### Won‚Äôt Fix Issues\n\nThere were some issues we chose to not fix despite agreeing they were good findings, because we wanted to avoid adding further risk or time delays. We‚Äôre listing those here explicitly for the sake of max transparency. There were other issues we did not fix because we disagreed with the auditors‚Äô analysis, and those are not listed here.\n\n\n\n* [Setting a new fork escrow contract might lead to lost tokens](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/issues/765)\n* [Proposals can move from Expired state back to Queued when timelock‚Äôs Grace Period changes](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/issues/764)\n\n\n## Changes in detail\n\n\n### Proposal editing\n\nProposals get voter feedback almost entirely only once they are onchain. At the same time, proposers are reluctant to cancel and resubmit their proposals for multiple reasons, e.g. prefering to avoid restarting the proposal lifecycle and thus delay funding.\n\nThere have been cases where proposers made promises offchain, e.g. to return part of the funds, but that is not captured onchain, and not visible to the entire voter base.\n\nThis feature introduces a new state into the proposal lifecycle:\n\n```\nUpdatable (new) ‚Üí Pending ‚Üí Active ‚Ä¶\n```\n\nDuring the Updatable state, a proposer can update their proposal‚Äôs description and/or transactions. Following the Updatable state, there‚Äôs a Pending state during which updates are no longer available before voting starts during the Active state.\n\nThe length of the Updatable state is configurable by the DAO, and starts at zero. This effectively keeps the feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow with proposed periods for the state, for example: Updatable: 5 days, Pending: 1 day\n\nThere‚Äôs also an onchain method of providing feedback to proposals while they are in the Updatable state.\n\n\n### Propose by signatures\n\n_Proposal threshold_ is the number of votes an account must control in order to submit a proposal. As of this writing an account must have at least 2 votes to pass the threshold.\n\nCurrent methods of sponsoring a proposal and their problems:\n\nNouners today either delegate their Nouns to proposers or submit the proposal on their behalf.\nDelegating is limited to Nouners, since delegates can re-delegate their vote to another account.\nWhen a Nouner delegates, they can‚Äôt use their voting power for the length of the proposal lifecycle which is very inconvenient.\n\nIf a Nouner/delegate chooses to submit a proposal on behalf of the proposer, we lose the meaning of who is the actual proposer and also the process itself can be cumbersome where the delegate needs to make sure the proposal looks good and pay gas for it.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new function to the DAO contract: `proposeBySigs`.\nThis allows anyone to submit a proposal and a set of signatures. The signatures are provided by voters and need to match the proposal content. If the sum of votes from all the signers surpasses proposal threshold, the proposal can be submitted.\n\nThe goal is to open another channel through which proposers can submit proposals, without necessarily finding a sponsor through private channels.\n\nVoters can only be signers if they don‚Äôt currently have an active proposal, either as a proposer or signer. Signers of a proposal can cancel it at any time, and the same is true for proposers; proposers should choose their signers carefully.\n\nThis allows both Nouners and delegates to ‚Äúsign-off‚Äù on a proposal, while the proposer address remains the actual proposer and without the need to change delegations.\nIt also allows pooling voting power, e.g. two delegates with 1 vote each can sign a proposal in order for it to pass the proposal threshold, currently at 2 votes.\nIt also opens the door to raising the proposal threshold since it‚Äôs easier to collect voting power.\n\nAs part of this update we are adding support for ‚Äúproposal candidates‚Äù to nouns.wtf, where proposers can submit their proposals and request signatures. In order to prevent spam, creating a candidate proposal requires either holding 1 vote or sending 0.1 ETH (the ETH recipient and the amount are configurable by the DAO).\nThe candidate proposals data are submitted to a side contract to make this data publicly available for any frontend to interact with.\n\n\n### Objection-only period\n\nThe goal is to protect the DAO from executing proposals that the majority would not want to execute. The threat is one where a minority trying to pass a proposal can let the proposal look like it's failing, to cultivate voter apathy, then cast many of their For votes just before voting ends, swinging the proposal from defeated to successful, leaving the majority wishing they were more vigilant.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new state in the proposal lifecycle: `ObjectionPeriod`.\n\n``` \\\n‚Ä¶ Active (regular voting period) ‚Üí ObjectionPeriod (conditional) ‚Üí Succeeded / Defeated \\\n```\n\nObjectionPeriod gets turned on only if a proposal turns from not passing to passing close enough to the end of the voting period.\n\nDuring the `ObjectionPeriod` state, only voters who haven‚Äôt voted yet are allowed to vote, but only _against_ the proposal.\n\nQ: Why not allow voting For a proposal during this extra voting period?\nA: Similar to the attack scenario described above, it would still allow voters to keep their votes to themselves and vote only at the last minute. In this case it would be right before the ObjectionPeriod ends.\n\nMore broadly speaking, the risk that a proposal passes when it shouldn‚Äôt, is much higher than the risk of a proposal not passing when it should.\nA proposal can be re-proposed, but a proposal that passes can‚Äôt be reversed.\n\nDAO configurable parameters:\n1. `objectionPeriodDurationInBlocks`: how long the objection period lasts, e.g. 2 days\n2. `lastMinuteWindowInBlocks`: what is considered ‚Äúlast minute‚Äù? e.g. 2 hours\n\nBoth parameters start with values of zero, effectively making this feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow turning on this feature with suggested parameters.\n\n\n### Votes Snapshot After Voting Delay\n\nThe current DAO implementation takes a snapshot of votes & delegation at the block a proposal is created, meaning Nouners have no lead time to put their votes in order, e.g. moving their delegations back to themselves to vote on something they really care about.\n\nThis upgrade changes the snapshot to be after the voting delay, i.e. once voting starts. Nouners will now have the duration of voting delay to transfer, buy, sell, delegate and undelegate their votes.\n\nBecause the nouns supply grows during the voting delay, nouns that are minted during the voting delay also participate in voting. Originally the snapshot was taken during proposal creation in order to align the total supply and the quorum and proposal calculations, which are performed at proposal creation time. Now that the supply has grown, this inconsistency is insignificant.\n\n\n### Nouns Fork\n\nFurther details can be found here in [the tech spec](https://github.com/verbsteam/nouns-fork-spec/blob/main/spec.md) and [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/iN0FKOn_oYVBzlJkwPwK2mhzaeL8K2-W80u82F7fHj8).\n\n\n### New treasury\n\nThe DAO fork feature requires switching to a new treasury contract which allows the DAO to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens when a fork executes. The current treasury (treasury v1) contract is not upgradable, so it requires a migration to a new one. The new treasury (treasury v2), deployed at [0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71), adds the new functions to the existing contract, and is upgradable to avoid the need for migrations in the future.\n\nThe migration includes:\n\n1. Transferring ETH, stETH, wstETH, rETH & USDC\n2. Changing ownership of the auction house, auction house proxy admin, nouns token & nouns descriptor contracts\n3. Change ownership of TokenBuyer and Payer to allow treasury v2 to perform ETH/USDC swaps\n4. Approve the treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\n\nOther assets in treasury v1 can be moved or approved to be moved in follow up proposals. Only assets in treasury v2 are included in the treasury forking in case of a fork.\n\nDAO proposals are limited to 10 transactions, therefore we are doing the migration in two steps. There will be a follow up proposal with the second part of the migration. The follow up proposal will go onchain once this one executes.\n\nThe DAO will still have access to the original treasury (treasury v1), by proposing proposals via the `proposeOnTimelockV1` function.\n\nExisting streams created by the DAO will remain controlled by treasury v1. If the DAO chooses to cancel them, the `proposeOnTimelockV1` function will need to be used.\n\n\n## Important heads up\n\n**Proposals that are queued but not yet executed before this proposal executes will need to be executed using the `executeOnTimelockV1` function. The regular `execute` function will attempt to execute via treasury v2 and will fail.**\n\n\n## Proposal #1 Transactions (this proposal):\n1. Send 2,500 ETH to new treasury contract \\\nThe rest of the ETH will be transferred in a followup proposal. We can‚Äôt tell in advance how much ETH the treasury will have at the moment this proposal executes so we are sending a first chunk now.\n2. Upgrade the DAO contract logic to V3\n3. Set the fork params:\n    a. forkEscrow: the escrow contract\n    b. forkDeployer: the contract which deploys new forked DAOs\n    c. erc20TokensToIncludeInFork: addresses of erc20 tokens which will be included in the treasury fork, specifically: stETH, wstETH, rETH and USDC\n    d. forkPeriod: the period during which token holders can join a fork after it has been executed, 7 days\n    e. forkThresholdBPS: the % of nouns required to surpass in order to activate a fork, 2,000 bps = 20%\n4. Set the proposal id at which the vote snapshot will be changed to be after voting delay\n    a. Sets it to the next proposal after the current one\n5. Transfer ownership of the auction house proxy contract\n6. Send stETH to the new treasury, leaving 5,000 stETH for proposals that may be queued\n7. Change ownership of the Nouns token contract\n8. Change ownership of the Nouns descriptor contract\n9. Transfer ownership of the auction house proxy admin\n10. Set treasury V2 as the new treasury of the DAO contract, and set treasury v1 to be available to reference for `proposeOnTimelockV1`\n\n\n## Proposal #2 Transactions:\n\n**This proposal will be submitted only after the first one executes, since only then we will know the final amount of ETH in treasury V1 to transfer as part of this proposal.**\n\n1. Move leftover ETH from treasury v1 to treasury v2\n2. Approve treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\n3. Transfer ownership of TokenBuyer to treasury v2\n4. Transfer ownership of Payer to treasury v2\n5. Approve unlimited stETH to be transferred by the ERC20Transferer contract\n6. Invoke ERC20Transferer to send remaining stETH to the new treasury\n7. Transfer all wstETH to treasury v2\n8. Transfer all rETH to treasury v2\n9. Transfer all USDC to treasury v2\n\nCan be viewed in more detail [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/9cbc7dde418d5ba7a1b50d0b0348dd14b6191404/packages/nouns-contracts/script/ProposeTimelockMigrationCleanupMainnet.s.sol).\n\n\n## Proposal #3 Transactions:\n\n1. Set ENS reverse lookup on treasury V2 to resolve to nouns.eth\n\n\n## Proposal execution notes\n\n* Proposals #1 and #2 will be executed on treasury v1, while proposal #3 is executed on treasury v2.\n* Prior to executing proposal #3, the accounts that control nouns.eth will set nouns.eth to point to treasury v2.\n",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 353 - Nouns DAO V3 upgrade, including Nouns Fork",
      "content": "# Nouns DAO V3 upgrade, including Nouns Fork\n\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal upgrades the Nouns DAO logic contract to V3. This version introduces the following changes:\n\n\n1. Proposal editing: adding a new initial state to the proposal lifecycle: ‚ÄúUpdatable‚Äù, during which proposers can update their proposal's transactions and text description. \n    * This feature will be disabled at first and will require a separate proposal to configure the period of the Updatable state.\n2. Propose by signatures: allowing Nouners and delegates to pool their voting power towards submitting a proposal, by submitting their signature, instead of the current approach where sponsors must delegate their votes to help a proposer achieve threshold.\n    * This feature will be activated once this proposal executes.\n3. Objection-only period: a conditional voting period that gets activated upon a ‚Äúlast-minute‚Äù proposal swing from defeated to successful, affording voters more reaction time. Only against votes are possible during the objection period.\n    * This feature will be disabled at first and will require a separate proposal to enable it and configure its parameters.\n4. Votes snapshot after voting delay: moving votes snapshot up, to provide Nouners with reaction time per proposal, to get their votes ready (e.g. some might want to move their delegations around). Currently the vote snapshot block is the proposal creation block.\n5. Nouns Fork: allowing Nouners to exit the DAO by forking to a new DAO. Current threshold is set at 20%. For more details please read [the tech spec](https://github.com/verbsteam/nouns-fork-spec/blob/main/spec.md) and [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/iN0FKOn_oYVBzlJkwPwK2mhzaeL8K2-W80u82F7fHj8).\n\nAn updated version of nouns.wtf will be deployed to add support for these features.\n\n\n## Audit\n\nThe DAO funded two audits for this version, first with Spearbit and then with code4rena.\nBelow is a summary of the results with links to the reports.\n\nPlease reach out to us (verbs team) if you have any questions regarding the findings.\n\nSpearbit found:\n* 0 critical risk severity issues\n* 2 high risk severity issues\n* 18 medium risk severity issues\n* 22 low risk severity issues\n\nFor more info: [the full Spearbit audit report](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/d417586ae46f8d32801a3028c2c3496b119fc032/packages/nouns-contracts/audits/dao%20v3%20-%20spearbit%20audit%20report.pdf).\n\ncode4rena found:\n* 1 high risk finding\n* 3 medium risk findings\n* 8 low risk findings\n\nFor more info: [the full code4rena audit report](https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-07-nounsdao). \n\n\n### Won‚Äôt Fix Issues\n\nThere were some issues we chose to not fix despite agreeing they were good findings, because we wanted to avoid adding further risk or time delays. We‚Äôre listing those here explicitly for the sake of max transparency. There were other issues we did not fix because we disagreed with the auditors‚Äô analysis, and those are not listed here.\n\n\n\n* [Setting a new fork escrow contract might lead to lost tokens](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/issues/765)\n* [Proposals can move from Expired state back to Queued when timelock‚Äôs Grace Period changes](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/issues/764)\n\n\n## Changes in detail\n\n\n### Proposal editing\n\nProposals get voter feedback almost entirely only once they are onchain. At the same time, proposers are reluctant to cancel and resubmit their proposals for multiple reasons, e.g. prefering to avoid restarting the proposal lifecycle and thus delay funding.\n\nThere have been cases where proposers made promises offchain, e.g. to return part of the funds, but that is not captured onchain, and not visible to the entire voter base.\n\nThis feature introduces a new state into the proposal lifecycle:\n\n```\nUpdatable (new) ‚Üí Pending ‚Üí Active ‚Ä¶\n```\n\nDuring the Updatable state, a proposer can update their proposal‚Äôs description and/or transactions. Following the Updatable state, there‚Äôs a Pending state during which updates are no longer available before voting starts during the Active state.\n\nThe length of the Updatable state is configurable by the DAO, and starts at zero. This effectively keeps the feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow with proposed periods for the state, for example: Updatable: 5 days, Pending: 1 day\n\nThere‚Äôs also an onchain method of providing feedback to proposals while they are in the Updatable state.\n\n\n### Propose by signatures\n\n_Proposal threshold_ is the number of votes an account must control in order to submit a proposal. As of this writing an account must have at least 2 votes to pass the threshold.\n\nCurrent methods of sponsoring a proposal and their problems:\n\nNouners today either delegate their Nouns to proposers or submit the proposal on their behalf.\nDelegating is limited to Nouners, since delegates can re-delegate their vote to another account.\nWhen a Nouner delegates, they can‚Äôt use their voting power for the length of the proposal lifecycle which is very inconvenient.\n\nIf a Nouner/delegate chooses to submit a proposal on behalf of the proposer, we lose the meaning of who is the actual proposer and also the process itself can be cumbersome where the delegate needs to make sure the proposal looks good and pay gas for it.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new function to the DAO contract: `proposeBySigs`.\nThis allows anyone to submit a proposal and a set of signatures. The signatures are provided by voters and need to match the proposal content. If the sum of votes from all the signers surpasses proposal threshold, the proposal can be submitted.\n\nThe goal is to open another channel through which proposers can submit proposals, without necessarily finding a sponsor through private channels.\n\nVoters can only be signers if they don‚Äôt currently have an active proposal, either as a proposer or signer. Signers of a proposal can cancel it at any time, and the same is true for proposers; proposers should choose their signers carefully.\n\nThis allows both Nouners and delegates to ‚Äúsign-off‚Äù on a proposal, while the proposer address remains the actual proposer and without the need to change delegations.\nIt also allows pooling voting power, e.g. two delegates with 1 vote each can sign a proposal in order for it to pass the proposal threshold, currently at 2 votes.\nIt also opens the door to raising the proposal threshold since it‚Äôs easier to collect voting power.\n\nAs part of this update we are adding support for ‚Äúproposal candidates‚Äù to nouns.wtf, where proposers can submit their proposals and request signatures. In order to prevent spam, creating a candidate proposal requires either holding 1 vote or sending 0.1 ETH (the ETH recipient and the amount are configurable by the DAO).\nThe candidate proposals data are submitted to a side contract to make this data publicly available for any frontend to interact with.\n\n\n### Objection-only period\n\nThe goal is to protect the DAO from executing proposals that the majority would not want to execute. The threat is one where a minority trying to pass a proposal can let the proposal look like it's failing, to cultivate voter apathy, then cast many of their For votes just before voting ends, swinging the proposal from defeated to successful, leaving the majority wishing they were more vigilant.\n\nThis upgrade introduces a new state in the proposal lifecycle: `ObjectionPeriod`.\n\n``` \\\n‚Ä¶ Active (regular voting period) ‚Üí ObjectionPeriod (conditional) ‚Üí Succeeded / Defeated \\\n```\n\nObjectionPeriod gets turned on only if a proposal turns from not passing to passing close enough to the end of the voting period.\n\nDuring the `ObjectionPeriod` state, only voters who haven‚Äôt voted yet are allowed to vote, but only _against_ the proposal.\n\nQ: Why not allow voting For a proposal during this extra voting period?\nA: Similar to the attack scenario described above, it would still allow voters to keep their votes to themselves and vote only at the last minute. In this case it would be right before the ObjectionPeriod ends.\n\nMore broadly speaking, the risk that a proposal passes when it shouldn‚Äôt, is much higher than the risk of a proposal not passing when it should.\nA proposal can be re-proposed, but a proposal that passes can‚Äôt be reversed.\n\nDAO configurable parameters:\n1. `objectionPeriodDurationInBlocks`: how long the objection period lasts, e.g. 2 days\n2. `lastMinuteWindowInBlocks`: what is considered ‚Äúlast minute‚Äù? e.g. 2 hours\n\nBoth parameters start with values of zero, effectively making this feature disabled. A separate proposal will follow turning on this feature with suggested parameters.\n\n\n### Votes Snapshot After Voting Delay\n\nThe current DAO implementation takes a snapshot of votes & delegation at the block a proposal is created, meaning Nouners have no lead time to put their votes in order, e.g. moving their delegations back to themselves to vote on something they really care about.\n\nThis upgrade changes the snapshot to be after the voting delay, i.e. once voting starts. Nouners will now have the duration of voting delay to transfer, buy, sell, delegate and undelegate their votes.\n\nBecause the nouns supply grows during the voting delay, nouns that are minted during the voting delay also participate in voting. Originally the snapshot was taken during proposal creation in order to align the total supply and the quorum and proposal calculations, which are performed at proposal creation time. Now that the supply has grown, this inconsistency is insignificant.\n\n\n### Nouns Fork\n\nFurther details can be found here in [the tech spec](https://github.com/verbsteam/nouns-fork-spec/blob/main/spec.md) and [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/iN0FKOn_oYVBzlJkwPwK2mhzaeL8K2-W80u82F7fHj8).\n\n\n### New treasury\n\nThe DAO fork feature requires switching to a new treasury contract which allows the DAO to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens when a fork executes. The current treasury (treasury v1) contract is not upgradable, so it requires a migration to a new one. The new treasury (treasury v2), deployed at [0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb1a32FC9F9D8b2cf86C068Cae13108809547ef71), adds the new functions to the existing contract, and is upgradable to avoid the need for migrations in the future.\n\nThe migration includes:\n\n1. Transferring ETH, stETH, wstETH, rETH & USDC\n2. Changing ownership of the auction house, auction house proxy admin, nouns token & nouns descriptor contracts\n3. Change ownership of TokenBuyer and Payer to allow treasury v2 to perform ETH/USDC swaps\n4. Approve the treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\n\nOther assets in treasury v1 can be moved or approved to be moved in follow up proposals. Only assets in treasury v2 are included in the treasury forking in case of a fork.\n\nDAO proposals are limited to 10 transactions, therefore we are doing the migration in two steps. There will be a follow up proposal with the second part of the migration. The follow up proposal will go onchain once this one executes.\n\nThe DAO will still have access to the original treasury (treasury v1), by proposing proposals via the `proposeOnTimelockV1` function.\n\nExisting streams created by the DAO will remain controlled by treasury v1. If the DAO chooses to cancel them, the `proposeOnTimelockV1` function will need to be used.\n\n\n## Important heads up\n\n**Proposals that are queued but not yet executed before this proposal executes will need to be executed using the `executeOnTimelockV1` function. The regular `execute` function will attempt to execute via treasury v2 and will fail.**\n\n\n## Proposal #1 Transactions (this proposal):\n1. Send 2,500 ETH to new treasury contract \\\nThe rest of the ETH will be transferred in a followup proposal. We can‚Äôt tell in advance how much ETH the treasury will have at the moment this proposal executes so we are sending a first chunk now.\n2. Upgrade the DAO contract logic to V3\n3. Set the fork params:\n    a. forkEscrow: the escrow contract\n    b. forkDeployer: the contract which deploys new forked DAOs\n    c. erc20TokensToIncludeInFork: addresses of erc20 tokens which will be included in the treasury fork, specifically: stETH, wstETH, rETH and USDC\n    d. forkPeriod: the period during which token holders can join a fork after it has been executed, 7 days\n    e. forkThresholdBPS: the % of nouns required to surpass in order to activate a fork, 2,000 bps = 20%\n4. Set the proposal id at which the vote snapshot will be changed to be after voting delay\n    a. Sets it to the next proposal after the current one\n5. Transfer ownership of the auction house proxy contract\n6. Send stETH to the new treasury, leaving 1,000 stETH for proposals that may be queued\n7. Change ownership of the Nouns token contract\n8. Change ownership of the Nouns descriptor contract\n9. Transfer ownership of the auction house proxy admin\n10. Set treasury V2 as the new treasury of the DAO contract, and set treasury v1 to be available to reference for `proposeOnTimelockV1`\n\n\n## Proposal #2 Transactions:\n\n**This proposal will be submitted only after the first one executes, since only then we will know the final amount of ETH in treasury V1 to transfer as part of this proposal.**\n\n1. Move leftover ETH from treasury v1 to treasury v2\n2. Approve treasury v2 to transfer lil nouns from treasury v1\n3. Transfer ownership of TokenBuyer to treasury v2\n4. Transfer ownership of Payer to treasury v2\n5. Approve unlimited stETH to be transferred by the ERC20Transferer contract\n6. Invoke ERC20Transferer to send remaining stETH to the new treasury\n7. Transfer all wstETH to treasury v2\n8. Transfer all rETH to treasury v2\n9. Transfer all USDC to treasury v2\n\nCan be viewed in more detail [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/blob/9cbc7dde418d5ba7a1b50d0b0348dd14b6191404/packages/nouns-contracts/script/ProposeTimelockMigrationCleanupMainnet.s.sol).\n\n\n## Proposal #3 Transactions:\n\n1. Set ENS reverse lookup on treasury V2 to resolve to nouns.eth\n\n\n## Proposal execution notes\n\n* Proposals #1 and #2 will be executed on treasury v1, while proposal #3 is executed on treasury v2.\n* Prior to executing proposal #3, the accounts that control nouns.eth will set nouns.eth to point to treasury v2.\n",

In the meantime, any Alien CryptoPunk owner could sell their punk to the contract, in exchange for the balance of the contract‚Äôs stETH. The Alien owner would need to use the ‚ÄúOffer to Address‚Äù feature for selling the punk to the contract. After settlement, the punk token will be sent to the Nouns DAO treasury address. If the deal is not closed within 69 days, the entire stETH balance will be sent back to the Nouns DAO treasury.\n\nA walkthrough of the code has been posted here [https://0xtycoon.medium.com/nounsalien-solidity-contract-walkthrough-9233a4b9ee4e](https://0xtycoon.medium.com/nounsalien-solidity-contract-walkthrough-9233a4b9ee4e)\n\nThe contract has been simulated on block 17781581 using this simulation test posted to Github [https://github.com/0xTycoon/alien-flip/blob/master/test/simulate.js](https://github.com/0xTycoon/alien-flip/blob/master/test/simulate.js)",

It's a living, dynamic thing that can be upgraded, improved, altered -- or defaced -- via proposal. It is yet another wondrous piece of lore that make up the ever growing nounish cultural landmark.\n\nAdding to the Nouns collection on the Nouniversary is a [tradition](https://nouns.wtf/vote/147) that we cherish deeply. One that we believe is worth protecting and nourishing until it can stand on its own non existent feet. Only time will tell how this tradition evolves, but we believe in a future where adding art to the Nouns contract is a worldwide event and cause for widespread celebration and recognition.\n\nBy compensating our efforts to keep this tradition alive, we hope that it can encourage more people to participate in growing, caring, and tending to the Nouns collection.\n\n----\n\nThere is a non-obvious amount of work and knowledge required to develop new traits for the Nouns collection. The design space of a 32x32 pixel grid is surprisingly large, and its only a narrow band -- a goldilocks zone -- that fits the style and feel of the original collection.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rymk9MHsn.png)\n\nWe request 88 eth for the work done over the course of 8 weeks. Funds will be split among Amiyoko, Facu, Goldy, Index, Krel, Solimander, and Tummlin equal to their individual participation and degree of effort in making prop 348 a reality.\n\n*In the event of prop 348 failing, this proposal will be cancelled.*\n\n‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\n",

      "content": "# Pay Dustin Yellin 50 eth to complete purchase of PERSON, PLACE, or THING\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of proposals 327 and 328.  328 was not properly executed and all of the NAC eth was transferred back to the nouns treasury.  As such, i am proposing that we approve a final 50 eth payment to complete the purchase of this sculpture.  As detailed below, we will then submit a new proposal for the first placement of the sculpture at Zero Bond in New York City.\n\nPrevious proposal text:\n\nIn April 2022 the Nouns DAO voted on and executed Proposal 48 - Nouns Psychogeography Sculpture with Dustin Yellin, wherein the Brooklyn-based artist was commissioned to update the Leviathan image by creating PERSON, PLACE, or THING, a new sculptural portrait layering each Nouns avatar into one fantastic body. For the commission, Yellin hand painted the 402 Nouns minted in Year One, integrating them into a unique glass artwork to forge a record of the history of the Nouns DAO, while branding its newest emblem.\n\nMuch like a yearbook, a ship‚Äôs manifest, or the signatures under a document, this snapshot provides a freeze frame of the DAO‚Äôs founders and builders. This in-all-is-one super-avatar represents the shared vision and trust between all stakeholders, while providing a rallying banner - an art object - that crystalizes how individuals are more powerful when they come together, and how a community can achieve the seemingly impossible by focusing its collective resources and talents around a common task.\n\nUpon acceptance of Proposal 48, the Nouns DAO compensated the artist with an initial deposit of 50ETH and made a donation of 100,000 USDC to the non-profit cultural center, Pioneer Works.\n\nA second payment of 50ETH and 1 Noun NFT (Noun 252 from the Nouns treasury) was agreed to be paid upon completion of the PERSON, PLACE, or THING sculpture and its accompanying NFT.\n\nLink to images of the finished sculpture: https://www.dustinyellin.com/d/6afb72\nLink to the NFT: Psychoprogeny - https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x3dde7d56735d5ab659544070679e9350d23d5b0b/2\n\nUpon acceptance of this proposal, the NFT for PERSON, PLACE, or THING will be transferred from DustinYellinDeployer to a Nouns DAO wallet.\n\nDustin Yellin Studio will then submit a new proposal to Nouns DAO requesting 12ETH to cover the expense of crating, transporting, and installing the 3,000 lb sculpture in the foyer of the main dining room of the Manhattan social club, Zero Bond, and back to the artist's studio at the conclusion of the loan period. The expected loan period will be 1-3 years, during which time Dustin Yellin Studio will work on additional loan placements for the work at museums and relevant cultural institutions worldwide.\n\nThe artist will provide an informative label to accompany the sculpture at Zero Bond, including details about the work and its ownership by Nouns DAO.\n\n50 ETH Deposit and transfer of Noun 252 to Dustin Yellin Studio:\n0x0B789Ef2A2cda2fb5B5c7cdB278C2Cb8BdC96e4C",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 349 - Support Creative Commons",
      "content": "# Support Creative Commons\n\n![Nouns x Creative Commons](https://i.imgur.com/NK23nSz.png) \n\n# Proposal \n\nCreative Commons respectfully requests 100 ETH to support the organization‚Äôs general operations and license infrastructure.  \n\n# Overview\n\nYou‚Äôve likely heard of Creative Commons Zero or CC0.\n\nCC0 has taken the NFT world, especially the community-owned brand Nouns, by storm. If you‚Äôre new to CC0, it‚Äôs a \"no copyright reserved\" option in which all copyright is relinquished and dedicated to the public domain. This enables use of CC0 NFTs with zero legal repercussions, inspiring creative derivatives and remixes of original works. \n\nCC0 may be everywhere, but here‚Äôs a lesser-known fact: Creative Commons is also a whole nonprofit organization (see our most recent annual report [here](https://creativecommons.org/2023/04/11/state-of-the-commons-2022/)). \n\nWe‚Äôve been around since 2001 and are a small but mighty team of 22 open access enthusiasts. We not only manage the CC licenses and public domain tools, we run campaigns, programming, and training in Open Education, Culture, Climate, and Journalism; host a CC Global Summit in locations around the world; and tackle major policy issues impacting the Internet and global commons as part of a broad Movement for a Better Internet. \n\nWe‚Äôre doing a lot, but it is all in service of the CC licenses, a thriving commons, and a healthy public domain, which can be expanded instantly by contemporary creators embracing the use of CC0, a globally interoperable public domain dedication tool. Like Nouns, we‚Äôre big promoters of remix culture, and have been watching (_largely from the sidelines until now!_) as NFT creators bring new energy and enthusiasm to the public domain.  \n\nWe‚Äôre excited to bring our two communities together to demonstrate the staying power of open access tools like CC0 even in a technological landscape that‚Äôs rapidly changing. Nouns is a prime example of this. You‚Äôre an open-source brand merging CC0 with blockchain. Nouns demonstrates the imaginative possibilities of combining public interest tools like CC Licenses with emergent technologies. \n\n# Request\n\nDespite being components of longstanding and emerging technologies, CC licenses are hard to fundraise for‚Äìmost people are unaware that there‚Äôs no underlying revenue stream to maintain their legal and tech infrastructure and continue to advocate for their use. The licenses are not new tech anymore, despite constantly being used in fresh ways, and it‚Äôs challenging when most funders are more interested in flashy new projects than supporting the work those ventures build on. \n\nWe are dedicated to preserving and improving our licenses, so that they can continue to be the go-to tool for future technology and creative work. That‚Äôs why CC is seeking funding for our general operations and license infrastructure, which would allow us to sustain currently underfunded but foundational areas of work: advocating for the use and adoption of open content at all levels and in all arenas, stewarding and innovating the licensing infrastructure we provide, and training future generations of creators and open advocates. \n\nWith support from Nouns, Creative Commons can prioritize the stewardship of the tools that have unlocked access to an estimated 2 billion works over the past 20 years. We are hoping your community will support us, as our work has supported your creativity.\n\n# Proposed Transactions\n\nDue to challenges that arise when Endaoment smart contracts are paired with Nouns proposal duration, this revised version of Prop 329 sends 100 ETH directly to Creative Commons' hosted wallet: \n\n0xf28ed835261b005C490D9d3D9eaADC54d9737d87",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 346 - Make Droposals Great Again",
      "content": "# Make Droposals Great Again\n### TL;DR\n\nDroposals (proposals to issue Nouns media as canonical NFTs from the DAO) have demonstrated [early signs of PMF](https://nounsagora.com/proposals/190), generating up to [hundreds of ETH in sales](https://www.thisisnouns.wtf/). However, they are not easy to do well because it's difficult to put one together both technically and socially.\n\nWe're going to build a super fast and easy to use droposal creator that also automatically updates nouns.wtf and and other frontends to feature any drops that the DAO approves.\n\n### What's the problem?\n\nWe know that Droposals can be wildly impactful. They can:\n1. Generate hundreds of ETH of revenue for the DAO and Builders\n2. Create more accessible ownership to canonical Nouns media\n3. Curate our best creations,¬†making our body of work more legible\n\nTalking to builders, there seems to be two major barriers to creating more successful droposals:\n\n1. Creating a droposal is not easy¬†‚Äì it requires putting together a complex transaction, and is subject to the same level of approvals as a potential protocol upgrade\n3. Even when you do manage create one, droposals are only successful if we're able to rally the whole community behind the mint\n\nAs a result, although Droposals have demonstrated success, we have not been able to make use of the format consistently as a community.\n\n\n### What we're doing\nWe're going to make it super easy to deploy and rally all of our attention resources behind droposals. The goal is to make it super easy to create a drop, and then to rally the DAO's excitement arond the mint. Concretely, this means a few things:\n\n**Step 1: Create a simple and powerful Drops Creator**\nWe'll deploy a drops-specific gov contract and a super easy to use droposal creator at nounsagora.com/drop. More details on how this contract works in the next section!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJqFrgI9n.png)\n\n**Step 2: Make drops incredibly exciting!**\nWe'll update both nounsagora.com and nouns.wtf to display droposal mints on the front page when there is one. This helps bring attention to the drop, further bring it into canon, and rally the community's excitement. \n\nOver the long term, we'll also work with other NFT sites like Zora and others to feature Nouns Drops so that getting your Droposal approved will catapult an artist to the top of every NFT site.\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S15Z7Ew52.png)](https://i.imgur.com/dCASfeo.mp4)\n\n**Step 3: Profit and proliferate!**\nBy making droposals accessible and impactful for artists, we think this Proposal will not only pay for itself, but also help us monetize and promote all future media funded by Nouns.\n\n### Drops creator contract early design\n\nSo how does the Drops creator actually work? Well, it's a bit like a mini governor contract controlled by Nouns token holders strictly for the purpose of managing and issuing drops. It does a two things: \n\n**Issue drops**\nAka create Droposals according to one of the types available.\n\n**Manage drop types**\nDrop types dictate the terms of the drop (price, editions, etc) in advance so that artists only have to put up their media for voters to decide whether they're excited about the work itself. \n\nOn launch, we will initiate the contract with a single flagship proposal type modeled after the successful This Is Nouns drop. The rough terms we're thinking are: 12 per year, 0.069ETH, 3000 editions. Split will be 60% artist, 30% DAO, 10% Agora.\n\nAnyone can create a type and set their own params, including fee. We could see there being many other types that are stewarded by different teams with different economics and cadence such as:\n* Free drop: free & unlimited on an L2, optimistically approved droposal\n* Oscars drop: only one allowed per year, more expensive, and high quorum to pass\n* Drops segmented by media type: episodes of a movie, Nounish\n\n\n### Future considerations\nIf the initial feature is successful, we have many ideas on how we can push drops even further:\n\n* We can make it easy to drop on L2s, which could be especially meaningful for free mints.\n* Approval voting can be used to choose one of many proposals to mint as the yearly \"Best media\". Almost like the Oscars of Nouns media\n* Droposals can act as a curation mechanism for us to find \"the best of\" Nouns. Using this, we can create a high quality Nouns media site showcasing our best work. Ranking on the site can be determined by the popularity of the mint\n\n\n### Funding & logistics\n\n**Funding**\n* We request 20ETH upfront to cover costs\n* Agora will charge a 10% fee on the flagship droposal type, and will return the first 20ETH in fees to the nouns treasury via a [0xSplit waterfall](https://docs.0xsplits.xyz/core/waterfall).\n* Anyone meeting the proposal threshold can create a droposal type with no fee (all dropoasal types will be minted from the same address)\n\n**Timeline**\n* Agora will provide biweekly progress updates\n* Expected to complete all within 2 months\n* When the contract is completed, another proposal will be created to deploy the drops creator and set its name to drops.nouns.eth",

The information is scattered. Accountability is important.\n \nWhat I have done since being funded in [Proposal 174](https://nouns.wtf/vote/174)\n- I have followed up with builders of all funded projects and shared all the awesome work they've done.\n- I am trying to get the most out of these projects in other ways too - trying to salvage \"failed\" projects, getting assets and items that might otherwise go to waste.\n- Thanks to those follow-ups, I have contributed to a lot of ETH being returned to the DAO, both in terms of leftover funds and forgotten volatility buffers (~150 ETH in total). \n- All of the data is stored in interconnected Notion dashboards, which allow searching and filtering based on many properties (category, value, true cost, ..).\n\n\n## Newsletter - [nouns.substack.com](https://nouns.substack.com/)\nNouns DAO is very active, with hundreds of funded projects & still more seeking funding. That means there is a lot of information, scattered throughout different channels (multiple Discord servers, Discourse, Twitter, ..).\n\n- I'm publishing a weekly [newsletter](https://nouns.substack.com/) highlighting the biggest things happening around Nouns, showcasing new and existing projects, proposals, art, and more. \n- Serves both as an information distribution mechanism and as a historic snapshot of the DAO ([Example](https://nouns.substack.com/p/raising-from-the-ashes)).\n- Special posts for Prop House Rounds, Accountablity specials, etc.\n- I've been publishing it since February 2022 without missing a single week = 100+ published posts with over 41,000 reads in total. Latest posts get around 500-600 reads with high open rate (40-50%), all organic. Subscriber count in steady uptrend from the start, currently around 660.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ9sCM-c3.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJwaAzZ52.png)\n\n**About me:**  Active in nouns everyday since Nov 2021, founding [Nouncil](https://nouncil.wtf/) and [Esports Pod](https://nouns.gg/) member, ... most of my work has been centered around tracking proposal progress and publishing weekly newsletter.\n\n## Funding\nPreviously funded via NSFW & then [Proposal 174](https://nouns.wtf/vote/174) for an average of 5.5 ETH/month. Funding from Prop 174 ended in April.\n\nI am asking for 4500 USDC a month until the end of 2023, a total of 36.000 USDC.\n- 13.500 USDC retro for May, June and July\n- 22.500 USDC streamed from August until the end of December\n",

It allows for an endless stream of contributions.\n\ncc0-lib benefits everyone in many ways ;\n\n1. access to a vast collection of CC0 resources\n2. easy searchability and findability of content\n3. showcasing the creativity from Nouniverse\n4. incentivizing builders by distributing through token rewards\n\nWe are requesting 25 ETH to continue the development of cc0-lib for the next 3 months (August '23 - October '23). *(see budget breakdown below)*\n\ncc0-lib official ‚Üí [cc0-lib.wtf](https://cc0-lib.wtf/)\ncc0-lib's changelog ‚Üí [cc0-lib.wtf/log](https://cc0-lib.wtf/log)\n\n\n---\n\n## **2. Proposal**\n\n## **Why we should fund this idea?**\n\n**Collect & Store**\n* We are building a platform where we gather all nounish cc0 materials & contents in one location for easy access and use.\n* Our platform supports a wide range of file types, enabling users to start using them instantly. *(eg; img, video, audio, 3D, figma, pdf etc)*\n* We provide a sitemap for better information accessibility and a solid overview of the contents.\n* We are using Arweave network to store all the datas due to its one time fee permanent storage and we want to use it exclusively for all storage going forward. The cost of uploading has been factored in under OpEx in Budget.\n\n*cc0-lib-3d (eg; .glb, .fbx, .blend)*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJF6Z9Qc3.gif)\n\n*cc0-lib-working-files (eg; .figma, .pdf)*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By78Mc75h.gif)\n\n*cc0-lib-random*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1VKQc7cn.gif)\n\nBy end of the year, we will receive a huge addition to the cc0 library by getting various of [open-source nounish hardware & schematics files](https://nouns.wtf/vote/277) *([Noggles LED Keychain](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1645788540499025920?s=20), [Nouns Governance Wallet](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1631322679172112384?s=20), [USB E-Ink Displaying Daily Nouns & Props](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1625883686561275905?s=20), [Etch-A-Sketch](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1624120919152001040?s=20), [Noggles Speakers](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1637133435549495297?s=20), and [Nouns Camera](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1646167941178703872?s=20))* from [Tigris](https://twitter.com/tigrisli) which would onboard more builders to the platform if everything goes accordingly.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJMohcWFh.gif)\n\nOn top of that, we can help builders continue to proliferate in their own creativity, context & interpretations if we could get more of these materials from the Nouniverse such as [giant noggles sculpture by Alps DAO](https://twitter.com/tha_swami/status/1674652226370048000?s=20), [noggles skate rail by vladhzc & Gnars DAO](https://twitter.com/vladhzc/status/1604573891300663296?s=20), [recycled plastic noggles by marinioac](https://twitter.com/marinioac/status/1676206035017650176?s=20). These physicals could be easily seen all over the world!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkCH-sZKh.png)\n\nEg; [JP](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp) and his team has built a [website](https://desafionouns.wtf/) using cc0 assets from [Nouns Explainer](https://nouns.wtf/vote/113) for [200K Video Contest Prop](https://nouns.wtf/vote/181).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyxRm-Nhdh.gif)\n\n**Distribute**\n* We offer an instant & user-friendly search feature to help users for quick results on the content they need.\n* Users can favourite contents they need for latter and easily access their favorite contents on the main page. \n* We provide a comment section on every contents. We also integrated with Farcaster, a decentralized social network, as any responses for a cc0-lib's content url will be displayed under *fc comments* on the corresponding cc0-lib's content page. For example ‚Üí [https://warpcast.com/n1/0x69b8c3](https://warpcast.com/n1/0x69b8c3)\n* We provide search persistence which allows users to persist the last search history they made on the website.\n* RSS - [cc0-lib.wtf/feed.xml](https://cc0-lib.wtf/feed.xml)\n\n*cc0-lib-fav*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ0Rzv7qh.gif)\n\n*cc0-lib-comment*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByEVVqQc2.png)\n\n**Contribute**\n* We provide a submission page for builders and artists to share their project materials within the ecosystem.\n* We want users to remix and shape new ideas upon the materials in any medium they prefer, fostering creativity in the ecosystem.\n* We introduce a contributor's leaderboard with the idea of incorporating a gamified experience to encourage participation in the ecosystem.\n* We are planning to create a token rewards system for contributors: Implement a system where contributors are rewarded with tokens based on their level of contribution to incentivize their participation. For example ;\n    * Tie unique NFTs (1/1s or OEs) to different levels of contribution (eg; 10, 50, 100, 1000 files)\n    * Organize challenges or competitions where contributors can compete and earn additional tokens or special NFT rewards based on their performance.\n    * Participation NFTs for prop house round, airdropped to all contributors / participants\n\n*cc0-lib-leaderboard*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJi2b5Qqn.gif)\n\n*cc0-lib-rewards (example)*\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk7C8Yjth.png)\n\n---\n\n### **Public API**\n\n* We are excited to announce that we have introduced a public API under the /api/data endpoint, enabling users to effortlessly retrieve data for various purposes.\n* Developers can use the cc0-lib's public API to access a wide range of data, including images, videos, audio files, and more. \n* With this comprehensive collection of CC0 licensed content, developers can integrate high-quality media into their applications, websites, and creative projects with ease. \n* Whether you're building a content aggregator, a creative platform, or a media-rich application, the CC0 library's public API provides a valuable resource for accessing and utilizing CC0 licensed content.\n\nAPI ‚Üí [cc0-lib.wtf/api](https://cc0-lib.wtf/api)\n\n---\n\n## **3. What we are looking to build next?**\n\nThese are the upcoming enhancements and features we will implement in the near future. We will also integrate based on user's feedbacks.\n\n- users profile & web3 connect\n- bookmark/pin\n- token rewards system for contributors\n- open-sourcing\n- more cc0 communities, more cool stuffs!\n\n---\n\n## **4.

I also think it's contradictory for the DeFi oriented DAO participants to advocate radical experimentation in the realm of financial engineering, governance pools, and so forth and then lambast culture-oriented participants as being irresponsible for making equally bold moves in the realm of cultural expertise. There are CT friends that I respect both FOR and AGAINST this prop and I think we should put it to a vote and let the DAO decide. I also thought the previous proposals to make a bid was a \"one foot in, one foot out\" position, so I'm resubmitting the proposal as a 'buyPunk' transaction. Good luck to all parties!\n\n![punk 5905](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/991432927260987423/1129084241486020760/big-punk.png)\n![cryptopunks](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/954618047707095081/1130636429412798574/5905.png)\n",

      "content": "# Establish Nouns FGC (Fighting Game Community) at EVO 2023\n\n![EVO Noggles](https://i.imgur.com/sCSnrda.png)\n\n\nProject Lead: [Keolaization](https://twitter.com/keolaization)\nSupported by The [Nouns Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports) Pod\n\n\n## Video Rundown - [Nouns Esports Audiovisual Proposal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rspS-OZAmw)\n\n## TLDR:\n\n*EVO is one of the world's biggest and most well-known fighting game tournaments. Yearly players from every corner of the globe come out to not only compete, but to fraternize and create memories that will last a lifetime.*\n\n*With the scale and magnitude of EVO within the fighting game community, this would be a perfect opportunity for Nouns Esports to expand from Smash into the larger fighting game esports sphere.*\n\n*Our objective this year is for Nouns to make a splash in the fighting game esports scene by sponsoring a large group of fighting game players at the largest fighting game tournament in the world! With the new Street Fighter title, this is the year to be at EVO and there would be many opportunities for the Nouns Esports brand to catch viewer and participant attention.*\n\n*Nouns Esports requests 36,000 USDC to sponsor a variety of fighting game players from around the world to attend EVO, the world‚Äôs largest fighting game tournament, taking place from Aug 4th to the 6th in 2023.*\n\n![EVO Tournament Pic](https://i.imgur.com/Xs9lUCU.jpg)\n\n\n## Description\n\n\n\nThis proposal expands our esports reach into the world of fighting games. \n\nSelection will be handled through [Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns-esports/) with Nouns Esports members providing outreach directly to fighting game community encouraging players to apply on the site.\n\n\n**Our plan:** \n- Around 30Ôºç40 Competitors at EVO\n    - All representing Nouns\n        - Noggles for all players + shirts\n- Noggles for all players\n- Nouns Esports shirts with a mock up visual for all players\n- Planned Nouns team-building/social event during EVO \n    - Idea: Pizza Party (potential PizzaDAO collab)\n- Planned media coverage (photos/video) - \n    - Questions like: \"What does Evo mean to you? Nouns?\"\n- start.gg affiliation (putting the Nouns custom tag when registering on start.gg for a tournament in the format of [Nouns | Keolaization]) \n\n**Funding Plan:**\n\n- 36,000 USDC ask \n- Unused funds will be returned\n    - Player Funding Cost (~75%)\n        - For each player the standard funding we will be providing to sponsor their travel and lodging is 300 USDC for North America and 800 USDC for international players\n    - Pizza Party/Social Event Funding Cost (~10%)\n            - Food: Pizza\n            - Drinks: Sodas/Water\n            - Venue: Either rent out a restauraunt/suite/conference space\n            - Other potential items: Plates, utensils, napkins, cups\n        - Possibility to run social event though PizzaDAO\n    - Operational Management and Support (~15%)\n        - Contributor pay\n        - Cost of travel for organizers to oversee the event\n        - Miscellaneous costs\n\n## **Why EVO?**\n\nLast year there were over 7,000 players participating from 63 different countries, with nearly 18,000 players in attendace at the venue, and over 3.7 million people who tuned in to the live stream for the event. This year, as COVID-19 restrictions loosen in many places around the world and things return to normal, it is guaranteed to grow even bigger. Especially with the prize pool minimum for main games being increased to $25,000, there will undoubtedly be more participants coming out to try prove their worth.\n\nMany select top players at this event are sponsored by various different companies and esports organizations, but there are many more who are either not sponsored despite their high levels of play or are sponsored but are not able to make it to Evo due to financial reasons such as lack of support from their team. This is where Nouns Esports can come into the picture.\n\nThrough players applying through Prophouse, we can sponsor select players based off of their skill as well as their needs to give them the chance to have the best possible experience at Evo. Whether it be a full ride for an extremely high level player or just a small boost to their funds, providing to the needs of the player will not only allow Nouns Esports to show their goodwill to the community, but can also spread the Nouns Esports brand and the Nouns brand to a potentially new community. Not only that, but if we can successfully sponsor the most players, it would be a huge PR win for the organization.\n\n\n\n## Who We Are\n\nNouns Esports was established in [Proposal 68](https://nouns.wtf/vote/68). We have since continued Nouns proliferation through esports as seen in [Proposal 91](https://nouns.wtf/vote/91), [Proposal 112](https://nouns.wtf/vote/112), [Proposal 119](https://nouns.wtf/vote/119).\n\nDota 2 & CS:GO\nPokemon Unite\nTaki & Aklo\n\n[nouns.gg](https://nouns.gg)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounsesports)\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/nounsesports)\n\n\n\n\n## **Multisig**\n\nWe will be using the same multisig that was created for [Proposal 263](https://nouns.wtf/vote/263) consisting of Nouners and Nounsfolk. \n\n- Sasquatch\n- Brennen\n- Maty\n- Oni\n- Peter\n\n![Nouns Esports Logo](https://i.imgur.com/rPHF40P.jpg)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll in all, we are looking to make a splash in the larger fighting game esports scene by setting the right foot forward and trying to make history. We really believe that we can gain traction and show our Nounish values to the larger community to create a long lasting relationship that will benefit both sides.\n\n### **Thank you for reading!**\n\n\n",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 340 - A Nouns Animated Series.",
      "content": "# A Nouns Animated Series.\n\n\n**TL;DR**:\n\nWe are requesting $95,000 USDC for the creation of the **first episode** in a, 13-episode, animated series, featuring Nouns. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P6anXPg.jpg)\n\n---\n# The Series:\n\n\n\n**We are proposing to create the first full-fledged animated series for Nouns.**\n\nThis will be a fun and thrilling series that will take us to a fantastic setting within a school, where we follow the adventures of five friends.\n\nEvery day, after the bell rings and classes end, a magical world reveals itself to these young friends. Each episode takes us on a new challenge or puzzle to be solved by the protagonists. They embark on magical missions, explore galaxies, secret rooms, and discover hidden passages that lead to incredible worlds within the school. The school environment transforms into a place full of surprises, with magic, creatures, and fantastic moments.\n\nWhile facing exciting challenges, the protagonists also learn important lessons about friendship, courage, and teamwork. They discover that true power lies in unity and trust in one another.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V7CflxQ.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jf2PpS1.png)\n\nThe **primary target audience will be children aged 7-11**. Our main goal is to inspire them through relatable characters, engaging stories, and meaningful dialogue that resonates with their own aspirations for the future. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UbWKeiv.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bXF0WBs.png)\n\nThe show will maintain a family-friendly atmosphere, exploring various themes like friendship, adventures, and romance. We also aim to **subtly introduce educational elements**, including more advanced concepts such as web3, blockchains, and DAOs, providing young viewers with an introduction to these complex topics.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AZUWCpG.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MBIaOKr.png)\n\n\n[Here you can find a complete breakdown of these first 5 characters, as well as initial plot concepts and script.](https://interesting-taker-974.notion.site/A-Nouns-Series-by-Breakout-10eafd6961da448083b45df3fea6c9fa)\n\n---\n# References:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Wd6LA3e.png)\n\n---\n# **Jux Animation Studio:**\n\n[Jux ](https://www.juxfilmes.com.br/)is an established animation studio and will be the company responsible for the production of the series. With a strong track record in the animation industry, the company has worked for many well known clients and brings a wealth of experience and expertise to the project.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/C2yPsUy.png)\n\nJux has a vast network of professionals from around the world, including illustrators, animators, writers, and sound producers, who will also contribute to the series.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NqRaQtY.gif)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KyEEXby.png)\n\nJux also produced the short film \"Through the Looking Noggle!\" as an entry to the Nouns video contest. The video recieved an overwhelmingly positive response, and was chosen as one of the four winning entries.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sghZnjI.gif)\n\n[Website and Full Reel](https://www.juxfilmes.com.br/) \n\n\n---\n# Core Team:\n\n#### **Marcello Laruccia (Animation Director)** - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcello-laruccia-84b09b23)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lJ0ujhf.gif)\n\n[Full Reel](https://www.dropbox.com/s/53qdlfgy24x6z68/MLaruccia_reel_2023.mov?dl=0)\n#### **Victor Canela (Lead Writer)** - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorgaz/)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BbdCk21.png)\n\n#### **Bruno Tedesco (Animation Supervisor)** - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-tedesco-b9829538/)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zfALXei.gif)\n\n[Full Reel](https://vimeo.com/457995567)\n#### **Patrick Dias (Creative Lead)** - [Portfolio](https://patrickdias.work/about-me)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CDSEXoE.png)\n---\n\n**Alongside the team above, many other talented professionals will be involved in the production of this pilot including:**\n\n[JukeBox](https://www.juke.art.br/) (Audio Production)\n[Daniela Zschaber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniela-zschaber/) (Writer)\n[Aurelio Ribeiro/TheBower](https://twitter.com/thebower_) (Exec. Producer)\n[Daniel Ferrari ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/d2-ferrari-a90b822b/)(Producer)\n\nAs well as supporting **illustrators, animators and editors**.\n\n---\n# Production Timeline:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/U7CxXj4.png)\nAbove you can find a **detailed view of each step in the production process.**\n\nDelivery of the first episode will be within **4 months** of this proposal acceptance. \nThroughout the production we will be posting **regular updates on a dedicated Telegram channel**, including teasers and details of the process.\n\n\nAfter delivering the pilot we will submit a proposal to produce the subsequent 4 episodes. All episodes after this first one will have a smaller, 1.5-month, production period each due to a lot of the ground work being done already, such as character and background development.\n\n\n# Distribution:\n\n#### - Youtube\nOur initial strategy will be to upload the series directly to a dedicated Youtube channel. **Content for kids on Youtube performs extremely well** and garners massive views. Our intent is to capture that audience and generate a significant viewership with a dedicated fanbase.\n\n#### - Droposal\nMuch like similar content released by Nouns, we will also seek to mint this first episode via a droposal.\n\n**However, we propose a novel distribution with 100% of the funds going back to the DAO.** The idea is to do a community poll with Nouners to decide the mint price.\nBased on the success of this first episode and mint sales we could see a significant revenue returning back to the DAO.\n# Road To Success:\n\nAfter the delivery of the pilot our intent is not only to produce the remaining episodes but to build the project into something even bigger. Here are some of the strategies we are planning:\n\n*(The following ideas are for the future of the project and not included in this proposal)*\n\n- Distribution Deal: Pursue partnerships through our industry contacts with TV channels and streaming providers - We believe the series would have a strong appeal to these companies as not only having a popular target audience of young teens but also by addressing new and innovative topics like blockchain and web3. \n- Merchandising and Toys: Partner with established companies to produce Merch and Toys featuring the characters in the series bringing another revenue stream for the series and the DAO.\n\n---\n\n# Budget Breakdown:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bG8tmAl.png)\n\n([Google sheet with complete budget breakdown](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1arqB7sFMJ9HpEraUbgLuhSR9cDxoOKv-pNQfC_2XP1I/edit?usp=sharing))\n\n\n**Total Ask: USDC $95.000** (~48 ETH at current prices)\n\n\n**This budget reflects the production of a high-quality, 6-minute animated pilot**, which also serves as the foundation for the series - this includes character design and personality, environment, plot, among other essential work.\n\n---\n## From The Team\n\n**Our objective is to create an amazing series that is unique and truly nounish.**\n\nWith this pilot we hope to showcase the concept and viability of this series, as well as lay a strong foundation on which we can build upon.\n\nOur team is passionate and commited to this project, many of us are strongly connected to the Nouns ecosystem and have a deep interest in its collective success.\n\nThank you!\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "# Nounify Korea - stamp collection (revised)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1e0gbXuh.png)\n\n### TL;DR\n- We propose to launch a stamp-collecting campaign to nounify Korea.\n- Our primary objective is to expand local Nouns community and make Nouns as a prominent pop culture brand.\n- By collaborating with coffee shops and utilizing Nouns' CC0 content, we can maximize Nouns' exposure and provide incentives for fans.\n- We are going to be present at two conferences. Five will be a speaker at HelloWeb3 and promote nouns and stamp collection campaign. Also we will collaborate with a coffee shop next to ETHCon where people will be able to redeem their coupons for t-shirts. During 3 day period of the ETHCon, people will be able to redeem t-shirts with only 2-stamps. \n- To achieve this, we kindly request $52,000 or around $3,600 per location to promote nouns at 10+ coffee shops, 2 retail stores, and 2 art galleries over the next three months.\n\n## Revisions of prop 322\n- Reduce funding from $65,000 to $52,000\n    - Removed magazine -$4,000\n    - Reduced t-shirts batch size -$9,000 (from 2,000 to 1,500)\n- Collaboration with a coffee shop next to [Ethcon](https://twitter.com/ethconkr/status/1675701724613591040) conference. The conference will bring together a lot of interesting people since **Vitalik** is a keynote speaker. The coffee shop will welcome conference and hackathon participants, where they can learn about Nouns, mingle, and redeem a t-shirt.\n- Five is going to join [HelloWeb3](https://twitter.com/hello_web3) conference as a speaker and it will be a good opportunity to launch Nouns' campaing and reach the target audience.\n\n### Details\nWe have observed the success of Nouns' flywheel in Brazil, China, Japan, and other communities. We propose to launch activation campaign in Korea in collaboration with ten authentic coffee shops. This campaign aims to educate people about nouns and engage them in the process. Participants will collect noggle-stamps and have the chance to earn stylish nounish t-shirts as rewards.\n\nOur team firmly believes in our energy and talent to establish Nouns as a prominent pop culture brand in Korea. The campaign will span three months, during which people will receive noggle-stamps with their coffee purchases. Once they collect 10 stamps, they can exchange a coupon card for a nounish t-shirt.\n\nTo ensure widespread exposure, all coffee shops will display posters and t-shirts. Furthermore, these t-shirts will be available for purchase at retail stores and art galleries. We are committed to creating high-quality t-shirts using nounish cc0 content, with additional approval from the artists involved.\n\n\nFor the successful activation of the nouns community in Korea and the promotion of Nouns in 14+ locations over three months, we kindly request $52,000 in funding.\n\n### The stamp collection campaign\n![](https://i.imgur.com/51HGjJe.jpg)\n\nThe campaign will focus on creating visibility, engaging local community, and establishing a loyal fan base. The coffee shops will become a place for people to gather and learn about nouns through arts on t-shirts and information in korean online.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1e0gbXuh.png)\n\nCoupon cards featuring nouns will be distributed at the coffee shops' counters. We anticipate each coffee shop to distribute around 50-30 coupon cards daily, totaling approximately 27,000 cards throughout the campaign. In our focused campaign, we will give out special coupon cards that need only 2 stamps to people who are interested in blockchain and NFTs through our network of friends.\n\n### T-shirts\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByDeX5Md3.jpg)\n\nT-shirts will be placed in highly visible areas at coffee shops. We'll use Nouns' cc0 content to create a beautiful collection of t-shirts. Our goal is to pleasantly surprise everyone with the quality and spirit of nounish artworks.\n\nThese t-shirts will be made from scratch specifically for this campaign from high-quality materials and tailored in various styles for both men and women. Each label and tag will feature Noggles and links to Noun's homepage and Twitter account.\n\nWe will strategically strive to get the t-shirts in the hands of pop stars, actors, musicians, and models.\n\nThe t-shirts will be the same as those for prop173, 'Sail in NY,' that received praise from the community for their quality.\n\n### Campaign map\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1Zj0T5u3.jpg)\n\nWe are going to collaborate with authentic coffee shops. Here are the links to coffee shops located in popular areas such as [Jeongno](https://www.instagram.com/cha.teul/), [Itaewon](https://www.instagram.com/theroyalfad/), and [Sinsa](https://www.instagram.com/minoscoffeecult/). Additionally, we are going to sell t-shirts at popular [Fashion and lifestyle](https://www.instagram.com/niceweather.seoul/) goods stores and [art galleries](https://www.instagram.com/print_bakery/).\nAs of now, we onboarded three coffee shops, one retail store, and one art gallery. We can rest of the partner properties recruited in no time.\n\n### Why Korea\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJUNQsvw2.jpg)\n\nKorea is known for its collection of cool nounish items, ranging from sailboats, resin toys, and children's books to motorcycles. In line with this, our goal is to unite and provide a firsthand experience to an increasing number of Nouns' fans. We believe that the timing is ideal to launch a nounish campaign, aiming to showcase the beautiful aspects of Nouns' art, culture, and governance. This initiative will not only attract a larger base of devoted fans but also facilitate the discovery of new nounish memes and contribute to the advancement of nounish culture.\n\n### Timeline\nThe campaign is scheduled to commence in July and continue until October. The team estimates that it will require approximately 3-4 weeks to complete all the necessary preparations.\n1 week - legal matters\n1 week - coffee shop recruitment\n1 week - decorations/logistics\n3 weeks - manufacture 1,500 t-shirts\n\n\n### The team\n1. **[Fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)** t-shirts manufacturing and allocation\n2. **[Morph](https://www.instagram.com/morphmgmt/)** - onboard and work with coffee shops.\n3. **[Jhee](https://twitter.com/jheeart_nft)** t-shirts design\n4. **[Duckhead](https://twitter.com/_duckhead)** coffee shops decorations\n\n### Budget\n$26,000 - manufacture 1,500 t-shirts (custom tags with noggles, different styles, artwork press, packaging)\n$10,000 - coffee shops' rental fees (10 coffee shops, 3 months, $330 per month)\n$2,500 - logistics & storage (Ex. 100 t-shirts weight 22 kg or 48 pounds)\n$2,500 - tax, signing contracts with coffee shops, outsourcing  company's fees to conduct business etc\n$3,000 - decorations $300 per coffee shop (10 t-shirt stands, 100 posters, 10 noggle stamps, 27,000 coupon cards, and others)\n$2,000 - photo & video production to document progress and share on SNS\n$6,000 - team's compensation.

      "content": "# Nerman.js - A Nouns SDK\n\n\n---\n\n## TLDR\n\n---\n\n26 ETH to continue development of [Nerman.js - Nouns SDK](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js) and the Nounish event feed discord bot.\n\n![Nerman](https://i.imgur.com/bZhHfhr.png)\n\n---\n\n## PROP V2 CHANGE LOG & NOTES\n\n---\n\n*In response to feedback from the previous proposal ([319](https://nouns.wtf/vote/319)), we have reduced our scope and ask. This is now for only 3 months and covers 1 full time dev + Joel Cares (part time strategy & dev).*\n\n*The primary work in this proposal is in continued development of Nerman.js, a Nouns SDK to help developers building in the Nouniverse. Actual discord bot development is a smaller part of the workload.*\n\n*We have also added much more specific features to each section in support of the general vision communicated before. Lesson learned - Nouns DAO does in fact prefer to see the long proposals with comprehensive details.*\n\n---\n\n## INTRO\n\n---\n\nNerman was funded by Nouns DAO through [Prop 77](https://nouns.wtf/vote/77). Our team has been hard at work programming Nerman's various bots and libraries since then. Check out [nerman.wtf](https://nerman.wtf) for a summary of the project and links to the various code repositories.\n\nIn this proposal we focus our efforts on two things:\n\n1. **Nerman.js ([GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerman))**\n2. **Nounish Feeds - Discord Bot ([GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman))**.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## NERMAN.JS - A NOUNS SDK\n\n---\n\nNerman.js provides simple type-safe access to Nouns DAO contract events, as well as custom events such as Noun O'Clock. The user provides a JSON-RPC url and connects directly to an Ethereum node without any further 3rd party hosted services.\n\nYou can install Nerman.js with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerman)\n\n**DEMO - NOUN O'CLOCK**\n\n``` typescript\nimport * as nerman from \"nerman\";\nconst Nouns = new nerman.Nouns( JSON_RPC_API_URL );\nNouns.on(\"AuctionEnd\", (data : nerman.EventData.AuctionEnd) => {\n    // It's Noun O'Clock, do stuff here!!\n});\n```\n\nFor more code examples see the ReadMe in [GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js). Nerman.js currently supports listening to Nouns DAO events such as auction creation, auction bids, proposal creation, dao votes, Noun creation, Noun transfer, delegation changes, and more. We also launched support for [Nouns Nymz](https://nouns.nymz.xyz/) and have a live feed posting in a Nouns community Discord.\n\n**NEW FEATURES - EVENTS**\n\nNerman.js will provide and maintain access to events across the Nouniverse. For each event we will have:\n\n - properly typed listener functions\n - trigger functions and sample data for testing\n - unit tests with sample and live data\n - clear documentation on Nerman.wtf\n - easy config option in Nerman Discord bot for anyone to add customized event feeds to Discord\n\nNouns DAO Events\n - All DAO Contract Events completed as described above\n - Events that require further calculations, like Prop Voting Start, Prop Voting Complete (failed, or succeeded and ready to queue), Prop Ready to Execute\n - Helpers to better parse data + format posts (ie better prop transaction summaries)\n - Updates to v3 contract if it occurs within time period\n   \nProp House Events\n - When instantiating the Prop House object the user will specify a community address and get events specific to that House\n - RoundCreated, ProposingStarts, NewProposal, VotingStarts, NewVote, RoundComplete\n\nFederation Governance Pool\n - General tool for listening to Federation governance pool events, instantiated with the specific pool address\n - We will cover the basics (bid, cast vote, execute) and explore other useful events from the contract\n\nNounsNymz\n - New Post (already completed, live in NCD)\n\n**NEW FEATURES - INDEXING**\n\nNerman.js will index on-chain Nouns data. This indexed data allows Nerman to offer more complicated and instant analysis of the data, including reporting behavior of voters, bidders, vote participation rates, etc.\n\n - Pre-indexed Nouns data included with library\n - Library can continue indexing to keep data up to date\n - Or - go trustless - start from scratch and index everything yourself\n - All basic DAO data will be available through function calls\n - We will implement further functions that offer simple analysis, such as getting voter participation rates or a list of proposals sorted by transaction size.\n\n**NEW FEATURES - DOCUMENTATION**\n\n[Nerman.wtf](https://nerman.wtf) will be a canonical source of knowledge about the Nouniverse, above and beyond technical documentation of Nerman.js. Our resources will be a useful starting point for anyone developing in Nouns.\n\n- SEO research and optimization to target terms people are actually searching for\n- Canon documentation of Nounish contracts on Ethereum and their associated ABIs\n- Map of different off-chain and in development Nouns projects with links to websites\n\n---\n\n## DISCORD BOT - NOUNISH FEEDS\n\n---\n\nNerman offers customizable Nounish event feeds for Discord channels, displaying formatted embeds with the main Nouns DAO contract events from Nerman.js. Users can configure which events to display in a channel with a simple command.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyX8b1U_3.jpg)\n\n**CURRENT NOUNISH FEEDS**\n\n- **Agora Discord**\n  Auction and DAO Proposal events in #gov-updates channel\n- **A Nouns Community Discord**\n  Auction and Proposal events in #general channel\n  Nouns Nymz posts in #nouns-nymz\n- **Nouncil**\n  Auctions, Proposals, Token Transfers in Feeds Section\n  Proposal votes and status changes posted in appropriate Prop threads in #nouncil-votes\n\n\n**NEW FEATURES**\n\nWe will add all Nerman.js events as we create them, allowing easy Discord notifications from Nouns DAO, Prop House, Federation, etc.\n\n - All above events easily configured by any Discord admin.\n - Add support for arguments in event registration commands so we can use general tools (ie Prop House, Federation Goverance Pools) to create event listeners for any specific community.\n - Simple subscriptions to commonly grouped events (Auction, Goverance, transfer + delegation changes)\n - Improved formatting + data on embeds.\n - Continued work setting up and optimizing event feeds in Discords, including NCD, Agora, Nouncil, as well as general consulting to support feeds in communities.\n - Experimental feed ideas, like a 0 vote weight feed as an informal on-chain chat.\n - Discord forum integrations for Nouns DAO proposals where a thread is automatically created for each prop and DAO votes and prop status changes are posted in the appropriate threads.\n\n---\n\n## BONUS POINTS\n\n---\n\nWe intend to complete as much of the above scope as possible within 3 months. If we move ahead of schedule we will spend the remaining time working on the features below:\n\n**Contract events from Nounish DAOs**\nA generic NounishDAO object that takes a contract address as the argument, verifies the events that it supports, and offers instant access to supported events from any Nounish DAO (Lil Nouns, Gnars, Builder DAO, etc).\n\n**Snapshot Events**\nA Snapshot object that allows you to specify a community on Snapshot and listen to its events, such as new Proposals and votes, and to get results when the vote is complete. This will assist with automations for communities that use Snapshot to coordinate Nouns votes, like [SharkDAO](https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth) and [League of Lils](https://snapshot.org/#/leagueoflils.eth).\n\n**Discord forum integration for NounsNymz**\nWe can pipe NounsNymz into an automated Discord forum where each new top level comment is its own thread, and sub-comments are included in that thread. This presents the conversations better than a simple new comment feed and allows for non-nouner discord users to engage in the discussion as well. We can also support NounsNymz hashtags so prop specific comments can be piped into a Nouns DAO proposal forum.\n\n**Prop House - Token Specific Feeds**\nSpecify a token (ie Nouns DAO) and get notifications from all houses that use that token to vote. We could create a #nouns-prop-house channel that posts any new round Nouners can vote on along with their deadlines.\n\n**Image Helpers**\nA variety of helper functions for interacting with Nouns on-chain image data, rendering it and converting it between file formats, resizing, generating images from seeds, getting image data for addresses for profile images, etc.\n\n---\n\n## TERMS\n\n---\n\n- funding for the team to continue developing Nerman up to Oct 31, 2023. \n- all code will be open source and released under a permissive license (such as MIT).\n\n---\n\n## TRANSACTION\n\n---\n\n**Total Budget: 26 Œû**\n1 full time dev + Joel Cares (part time)\n\n**Transaction**\n26 ETH streamed to 0x09b68020Fb9691C2c20687631EDCF16fdFCba277",

I also think it's contradictory for the DeFi oriented DAO participants to advocate radical experimentation in the realm of financial engineering, governance pools, and so forth and then lambast culture-oriented participants as being irresponsible for making equally bold moves in the realm of cultural expertise. There are CT friends that I respect both FOR and AGAINST this prop and I think we should put it to a vote and let the DAO decide. I thought the previous bid was too high, so I'm resubmitting at 4769.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 335 - Nouns Wallet - $3M to $5M a year in revenue for Nouns DAO",
      "content": "# Nouns Wallet - $3M to $5M a year in revenue for Nouns DAO\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**1-minute explainer video:**\n[![Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/uhbaVoQMKDU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhbaVoQMKDU)\n\n**How can it benefit Nouns DAO?:** 90% of the revenue generated by the product goes straight to Nouns DAO. Estimated to be $3-5M a year. Basis of the estimate is explained in detail in the proposal below.\n\n**Main value proposition to users of this product:** Increases users' asset allocation to hot wallets, thus helping users access DeFi and the metaverse in an agile, secure and comfortable manner, reducing time costs and transaction costs involved regularly refilling hot wallet accounts. Not a single hot wallet product exists in B2C form that gives users access to fully flexible threshold signing schemes. Nouns Wallet will be the first to introduce this idea, and in a fully transparent manner.\n\n**Ask:** \n25 ETH round 1\n\n25 ETH round 2\n\n**Detailed Proposal:**\n\nThe B2C hot wallet market has been under the firm grip of MetaMask, riding high on its first-mover advantage. However, this dominance has left customers vulnerable to unfair policies and practices imposed by MetaMask. First, they sneaked away from open-source code to closed-source. And now, brace yourself, their updated privacy policies grant them the power to track user IP addresses and more! Sure, they claim not to keep this data for more than 7 days or sell it, but can we really verify that? Who will be held accountable for any shenanigans? What are the loopholes in this web of secrecy? Plus, let's not forget, this opens up a single point of attack for snooping into customer data. The only way to escape this labyrinth is through complete transparency of code.\n\nBut wait, there's another gaping hole in the B2C hot wallet industry! It's the absence of fully flexible threshold signing schemes for users. Hot wallets are crucial for interacting with web3 applications and protocols. However, these hot wallets, like MetaMask, store the entire private key on the user's machine. It's like leaving the door wide open for attacks, as the key remains decrypted for the duration of wallet activity, in order to make digital signatures.\n\nNow, some wallets try to beef up security and tackle this single point of attack issue by offering 2-factor authentication (2FA) or even 3-factor authentication (3FA). But guess what? These traditional forms of 2FA or 3FA rely on third-party applications that specialize in 2FA, like Authy, Duo Mobile, or Google Authenticator, and/or depend on third-party entities, such as 2FA from Google Cloud or email codes. This introduces the dreaded risk of a centralized point of failure! It forces users to always have access to these third parties and assumes they will function flawlessly. Some wallets even offer 2FA through their own mobile apps or via SMS codes, but alas, this makes users susceptible to SIM swap attacks. And let me tell you, SIM swap attacks have wreaked havoc on crypto holders in the past. Countless articles on the internet can attest to that.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, some wallets have attempted MultiSig, where one signature is required from the user's key and another from the company's key. But let me tell you, this setup is not only inefficient and inflexible, but also lacks ironclad security. Inflexible because any changes to the keys, adding or removing them, require rewriting the code. It's like making it set in stone when it comes to signing policies (2 of 2 or 2 of 3 being the most common) and the keys generated and used. Moreover, MultiSig demands exorbitant transaction fees due to the need for higher block space or, in simpler terms, multiple signatures required to sign the transaction on the chain.\n\nBut behold! We have the ultimate solution to tackle all of the above conundrums: Fully Open-Sourced Threshold Signing! Sounds cool, right? It's time to revolutionize the game and bring back the fun, security, and flexibility that users truly deserve!\n\n1-minute explainer video: [![Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/uhbaVoQMKDU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhbaVoQMKDU)\n\n\n![Image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1FgrRd7k2ckTGqV1ByW1LyC5FbqBg3fBX)\n\n\n\nAdditionally, being fully open sourced makes us verifiably user-friendly in terms of privacy policies and security.\n\n**Estimated Revenue to the Nouns treasury from this project**\n\nLet's dive into the exciting realm of revenue figures! If we cast our eyes upon [this chart](https://dune.com/queries/19721/40444), MetaMask has been raking in around $200,000 per day in fees over the past few months. That's a whopping $70 million per year, give or take! For more in-depth insights, you can check out the [comprehensive dashboard](https://dune.com/tomhschmidt/metamask-swap) and enlightening [article](https://thedefiant.io/metamask-raking-in-170k-day-shows-defi-wallets-work-as-businesses) on MetaMask's daily and cumulative swap fee revenue.\n\nNow, let's shift our focus to Exodus, a prominent player in the hot wallet scene. In the last two Q3s, their quarterly revenues reached a commendable $18 million and $11 million, respectively. If you're hungry for details, head over to [this page](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/11/09/2552383/0/en/Exodus-Report-Third-Quarter-2022-Results.html) and feast your eyes on the specifics.\n\nBut here's the exciting part: We aim to compete head-on with MetaMask and other hot wallets by offering a threshold MPC system ingeniously integrated into browser extension and web app hot wallets. With all the potential this project holds, we conservatively estimate that it could eventually churn out a remarkable $3 million to $5 million per year in swap fees alone. And who knows, it might even soar to the astounding heights of $70 million, just like MetaMask!\n\nWhen it comes to revenue distribution, we've got a plan. For the first three years, the revenue will be divided into a 90-10 split between the Nouns Treasury and the devoted development team. This approach ensures resources are allocated for continuous product enhancements and growth. However, after the three-year mark, the Nouns DAO holds the power to either renew this revenue split or gracefully take 100% of the revenue for themselves.\n\n**Funding Ask and Deliverables**\n[Figma Prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/6YX5xeU16rpvhybQm8OMhR/Nouns-Wallet?node-id=1-2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2)\n\n![Image](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1WKE6IrnbiDURXj5DwTGbfmVKP7GeG5QM)\n\n**25 ETH Round 1** ‚Äì With a solid infusion of 25 ETH, we will kickstart the development of a basic yet functional Threshold Signing wallet. Within a swift timeline of just 2 months from the funding date, our talented team will focus their expertise on cryptography and backend wizardry. The frontend will have a simple, user-friendly interface adorned with a logo inspired by the captivating Nouns theme. To proudly showcase our collaboration, the wallet interface will prominently display \"Powered by NounsDAO.\" During this initial phase, we will demo the threshold signing capability exclusively on laptops. But fret not, as we have big plans for Round 2!\n\n\n**25 ETH Round 2** ‚Äì Round 2, brace yourselves for greatness! With another 25 ETH in hand, we will elevate the UI/UX design aimed to maximize user experience and simplicity, ensuring that our wallet becomes an intuitive and seamless companion for crypto enthusiasts. As we fine-tune every detail, the wallet will be prepared for its grand launch. The timeline for this monumental event will be thoughtfully and collaboratively decided between our passionate team and the vibrant Nouns community.\n\n**Team**\nThe team building this are specialists in advanced cryptography and are also currently building a trustless bridge between non EVM chains.\nTo find out more about the team go to:\n[insaanity.io](https://insaanity.io)\n\n**Feedback from the Nouns community taken into consideration**\n\nWe express our heartfelt gratitude to the vibrant Nouns community on Discord and Discourse for their active participation and valuable feedback on our proposal. Your insights have been instrumental in shaping our approach, and we greatly appreciate your engagement.\n\nIn our previous communication, we had initially proposed a funding amount of 250 ETH for Round 2, with a significant portion of 200 ETH allocated towards code audits. This decision was primarily driven by our intention to utilize our proprietary threshold signing algorithm, which boasted certain advantages over the already audited threshold cryptography schemes available in the market. Notably, our algorithm showcased resilience against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, providing an added layer of security.\n\nHowever, we carefully considered the community's concerns regarding the substantial expenditure of 200 ETH solely on code audits. We wholeheartedly understand and respect the need for responsible resource allocation. Therefore, we have revised our approach and made the decision to leverage already existing standard audited libraries as our foundation, building upon their established security foundations. This strategic shift has significantly reduced our funding request to a modest 25 ETH.\n\nTo address any lingering apprehensions regarding DoS attacks, we have further fine-tuned our strategy. Out of B2B and/or B2C options, we will adopt the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) model, where the distribution of key shares will be limited to one's own devices and/or trusted family members' devices, rather than across unknown communities' devices. This approach ensures a more controlled and secure environment, where the threat of DoS attacks can be safely assumed to be absent.\n\nWe remain committed to our goal of delivering an exceptional threshold signing wallet, fortified by security best practices and community-driven input. Your feedback has been invaluable in shaping our path forward, and we are excited to continue this journey together, building a product that exceeds expectations.\n\nOnce again, we extend our sincere appreciation to the Nouns community for your unwavering support and collaboration. Let's embark on this exciting endeavor, shaping the future of hot wallets with utmost diligence and innovation!\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 334 - [Resubmission] Expanding Global Distribution of Lo-Fi Noggles",
      "content": "# [Resubmission] Expanding Global Distribution of Lo-Fi Noggles\n\nWe are resubmitting this proposal with a few adjustments about Noggles allocation, on demand distribution and improved analytics.\n\n**Allocation:** We will review and talk to all of the high-level Noun builder communities and determine the best allocation and distribution of the LoFi Noggles based on their activation needs. We will determine how to divide up the 25,000 pieces in order to achieve the best possible dispersal around the world. We'd like to gang up shipments (one shipment per geographic area) so that the recipients can disperse smaller shipments to more recipients in the same geographic area.\n\n**On demand distribution:** Any left over stock beyond what is shipped to Builders will ship to our US warehouse where it will be processed and stored until it is needed by various funded props or people who buy them from us in bulk or in smaller quantities as needed at a discount. This will enable us to ship Proliferator Packs and disperse them around the world in single efficient packages.\n\n**Some examples of how the products could be used:**\n\nBundled ‚ÄúParty Packs‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúPassed‚Äù Prop welcome bundle includes a case of 10 plastic Noggles, 50 paper Noggles and 50 pins. This is basically a Party Pack that enables a super fun Nouns-themed event and gives the builders an opportunity to share and document their experiences and journey, share info and more with the world as they build their project. $600 + shipping. \n\nProliferator Packs:\n\nFor Nouners and builders planning IRL events or contests: could come in 4 tiers to supply a variety of sizes of events and prize pools:\n\nTier 1: Single pair of Noggles: $20 + shipping\nTier 2: 50 pack Lo-Fi: $150 + shipping\nTier 3: 1 pair of Noggles, 50 Lo-Fi, 10 pins: $220 + shipping\nTier 4: Case of 10 noggles, 100 Lo-Fi, 50 pins: $750 + shipping\n\nThese numbers would be included in the various proposals and made available to all of the builders with passed props, or anyone wishing to supplement their executions.\n\n**Improved analytics:** Data gathered from the views and clicks of the Nounworks [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/nountown) and the back end of our [website](https://www.nounworks.wtf/) and [shop](https://bigshottoyshop.com/collections/nouns) have proven the effectiveness of the dispersal of Lo-Fi Glasses at events around the world. Usage of the included QR code (which leads to the Nountown Linktree) spikes around these activations. January 1, 2023 was the Rose Parade where the LoFi Noggles were handed out:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJeMbFQjY3.jpg)\n\n\nWe see similar spikes just after NFT Paris & NFT NYC dates, and the Licensing show in late June had a significant click-through spike because we instructed people to scan the QR code on site. (LoFi Noggles were also handed out at each of those events).\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryrFMZiK3.png)\n\nThe spikes in Linktree visits directly affect traffic to a variety of useful Nounish links including Nouns.wtf, Nounish.world, plus our informational website, Nouns shop, etc. This is proliferation in action! A really interesting note is that the people who receive the Noggles take them home and interact with the QR codes even more in the week following the event:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryK6GGjK2.png)\nAbove, see the gradual increase in views (green) and clicks (purple) in the 3 days immediately following the Rose Parade (Jan 1). So none of the spikes are 1-day spikes, they are all nearly a week of increased traffic and discovery by people all over the world:\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJBxmfit2.png)\n\n\n**About us:** As a veteran manufacturer in the Nouns ecosystem, [NOUNWORKS](https://twitter.com/nounworks) has a proven pipeline for delivering quality products. We would like to place Noggles onto the faces of every Nounish person on the planet. We are requesting funding to create another run of Lo-Fi Noggles. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkK1-Kqr3.jpg)\n*25K+ Lo-Fi Noggles to supply large-scale IRL events*\n\n# STEP 1: Decide who gets what\n\nWith this production run we plan on outfitting various active members of the global Nouns community so that their IRL events are even more Nounish. \n\nWe will survey groups to understand their needs, and we will accept requests and inquiries from people writing props or planning events. \n\n**Note that this survey has already begun in the Discourse [here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/worldwide-lo-fi-noggles-everey-where-reorder/4674) and many groups have already confirmed a strong interest in receiving shipments of the Lo-Fi Noggles:**\n\n**Nouns Running:** *\"As the founder of the Nouns Running Club, I can say that we REALLY need these. We had a small batch of 30 donated by another grantee, and they went like hotcakes. People really liked them and it was a good way for people to feel good after a run and they just GOT the good vibes.\"*\n\n**Pizza DAO:** *\"Was incredibly excited to be able to distribute these at our Global Pizza Event. Also, having them at our events offered another layer of experience for our party attendees by offering them as a ‚Äúprop-for-participation‚Äù (it was great for attendees to be able to jump in a photo or video and play ‚Äúpass the noggles,‚Äù etc‚Ä¶while meeting up for some pizza). Enjoy the energy this can bring to events all over! Would love to get a bunch for future events!\"*\n\n**Mucho Love:** *\"Lo-Fi Noggles are more than just fun cardboard eyewear for Mucho Love. They serve as a tangible manifestation of the spirit and ethos of our organization. As we engage in our various activations, these Noggles serve as an icebreaker, a conversation starter, and a symbol of our commitment to spreading joy and positivity. They enhance our content‚Äôs recognizability, making it stand out and resonate with audiences familiar with Nouns. They are instrumental in fostering community, spreading our message, and enhancing the impact of our work.\"\"*\n\n**Serpunk:** *I think this is a good idea. A low budget option to nounify any event should exist and I believe this is it!*\n\n**Nouns in Rio:** *\"We definitely need those for Nouns in Rio/NounsBR events!*\n\n**Nouns Amigos:** *\"Noggles set the vibes for any IRL event! Definitely needed for Nouns Amigos community ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\"*\n\n**Gnars:** *\"Be very keen to reserve 2500 pieces for Gnars and Art Haus related events!\"*\n\n**Nouns Whisky:** *\"this is awesome! We could distribute 3000 of them.\"*\n\n\n\n[MANY more positive reactions and support / requests for this prop here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/worldwide-lo-fi-noggles-everey-where-reorder/4674/7).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1r1Yuk_3.jpg)\n\n# STEP 2: Produce more Lo-Fi paper Noggles \n\nFactory produces what we need to outfit Nounish groups worldwide (we are estimating 25K units). \n\n# STEP 3: Ship worldwide\n\nCases of Lo-Fi Noggles ship to Nounish groups directly from factory.\n\n# STEP 4: Remaining units held in USA for future use\n\nThe rest of the production run (if there are any extras) will be shipped to our warehouse in USA to be allocated and distributed as needed.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SySXKByr2.jpg)\n\n# Why do it this way? \n\nThis plan avoids chaos and increases production and logistical efficiency. (End result: better and more accurately planned proliferation of Nouns on a global scale).\n\n# This round of production:\nThese are the high quality cardboard versions of our classic Noggles design, but created in a flat packed / inexpensive format. Each pair comes packaged with an informative backer card and is easily shipped and distributed at events worldwide. \n\nThis run will improve with heavier cardstack, a 2-sided full color backer card, and a polybag.\n\nLo-Fi Noggles come packed in 50-piece bundles and can be produced and shipped in very large quantities to Nounify even the biggest events. \n\n\n# Why 25K units?\n\nWe feel that 25K pieces is a small ask based on the popularity and the huge need for affordable and easily shipped Noggles around the world. \n\nWe will survey Nouns community members to find out what quantities each of them may require for their upcoming activations.\n\nFinal quantity depends on requests from active Nouns community, event planners and creators.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJXUFuJOn.jpg)\n\n\n# Who is slated to receive Lo-Fi Noggles?\nBelow is a list of some of the active communities that we are considering. They are scattered around the world and host / organize frequent IRL events: Wwe will dial these numbers in once the proposal passes for best allocation.\n\n* [Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports): 3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [NOUNS RUNNING](https://twitter.com/NounsRC):  3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [Nouns Amigos](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos):   3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [NOUNS Africa](https://twitter.com/nounsDAOAfrica)\n* [GNARS](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao): 3000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [Alps Dao](https://twitter.com/AlpsDAO) \n* [NOUNS WHISKEY](https://twitter.com/Nouns_Whisky): 3000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [Profwerder](https://twitter.com/ProfWerder): 1000 pcs for ongoing local events\n* [NOUNS Brazil](https://twitter.com/nounsbr)\n* [Nouns Latin America](https://twitter.com/NounsLatam)\n* [NOUNS OTG](https://twitter.com/OTGWTF)\n* [PIZZA DAO](https://twitter.com/Pizza_DAO): 3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [Australian Open](https://twitter.com/AustralianOpen)\n* [NFT Paris](https://twitter.com/nft_paris)\n* [Nouns Deli](https://twitter.com/NounsDeli): 3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events (USA to Australia shipping is very expensive so this one is great for the team)\n* Free Glasses For Kids / Vision Van\n* **If anyone else has a need for 1000+ pairs of Noggles for an activation, please DM us.**\n\n\n# Improved unit cost:\n$1.95 + shipping, minimum 25K units to achieve this pricing, no maximum order size. [Previous order](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/low-fi-nounish-noggles-by-bigshot/2103/59) costed $2.40/unit.\n\nWorldwide shipping costs average to $350 per carton of 1000, and we'd make minimum of 25 cartons. \n\n# Total ask for 25K units:\n‚Ä¢¬†$57,000 in USDC for production and shipping \n‚Ä¢¬†$7,200 USDC for 6 months of warehousing, order processing and communications \n\nTOTAL: $64,200 USDC total deposited into the Nounworks projects wallet:\n\n0xd25912007EBC2527d4ED9DC536f928E550b0f02C\n\n# Why now?\nTo ensure we can distribute the Noggles worldwide ASAP, we aim to place our order with the printer as soon as possible.\n\n\n# After we ship to Nouns community members: \n\nShipping fees TBD after the remainder gets to the USA, handled on a case by case basis. (See next prop which deals with ongoing funding for distribution of Nouns merch to members of the community).\n\nIn general once the unclaimed units get back to our USA warehouse, the cost to turn around and ship them again will be $2 per unit for the Lo-Fi Noggles and $2 more to ship them. They are in packs of 50 so that would be $200 shipped to get a pack of 50 back out to another country. That cost will be covered by the recipients or their props.\n\n# Info about our previous order:\n10K units were paid for by Nouns DAO (NSFW) and an additional 3K units were paid for by Bigshot. All have since been dispersed globally, sold out and gone. All faces wearing Lo-Fi Noggles were happy faces!\n\n# So what's next?\n\nGlad you asked. [We will have a follow-up prop that will fund our ongoing supply of our Nounish merch to members of the Nouns community worldwide](https://hackmd.io/@bigshot/BJSZdHJBh    ). This will complete the proliferation machine and will ensure a constant stream of Nounish merch to the doors of the right organizations. Let's go!\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJkXY_Jdh.jpg)\n\n\n",

      "content": "# stETH Peg Protection Execution\n\nThis proposal will execute the underlying effort of the successfully passed proposal to obtain [stETH Peg Protection](https://nouns.wtf/vote/313). \n\nAs a reminder, this effort required two steps: \n\n- ************Part 1 (completed):************ Audit the helper contracts that enable the DAO to execute transactions on L2 and purchase protection using the already existing and audited Nouns [token-buyer](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer) contracts ([OptimismL1Proxy](https://github.com/portaldiscovery/optimism-cross-chain-proxy) and [CozyMultiOraclePriceFeed](https://github.com/portaldiscovery/cozy-v2-token-buyer))\n- ************Part 2 (current):************ Set the bid price for stETH peg protection on the CozyMultiOraclePriceFeed to 2% and transfer 12 ETH to the TokenBuyer dedicated to buying protection\n\nSince the passing of the part 1, the Nouns helper contracts that enable the DAO to swap tokens on L2 have been [audited](https://github.com/portaldiscovery/cozy-v2-token-buyer/blob/main/audits/veridise-report-july-3-2023.pdf) and deployed ([OptimismL1Proxy](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4d6EC0e31c9177c696Fb49c2Ad04aB766e91F38f), [TokenBuyer](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xdD9e5Dab49d8394660d4Fe2383692448e3944d2b), [Payer](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xc2a9a0d746535cec8dd841651172396dea38464c), [CozyMultiOraclePriceFeed](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x31D2CfCFD44e0e1F5c36d065E665b56B6354EA5c)). This proposal will complete part 2 by transferring 12 ETH to the TokenBuyer. \n\n## FAQs\n\nAddressing some questions raised during the voting period. If you have other questions, join the [discussion telegram group](https://t.me/+rfuoI8SkzxdhYjRh) and ask.\n\n### Is there enough capacity on Cozy v2 for the DAO to get the proposed amount of protection?\n\nYes. At the time of writing there‚Äôs currently ~$1M of available stETH peg protection protection on Cozy v2. \n\n### How exactly does the ‚Äúbid‚Äù work?\n\nUpon execution of this proposal:\n\n1. The tokenbuyer will be configured with a bid price of 2% (which translates to ~1.5% APR) for stETH peg protection tokens\n2. 12 ETH is transferred from the DAO treasury to the tokenbuyer\n3. Third party arbitrageurs sell protection tokens to the tokenbuyer in exchange for ETH  \n\nAny ETH that isn‚Äôt purchased by arbitrageurs can be withdrawn by the DAO. \n\nFor more details on how the token buyer works, visit this [github repo](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer). \n\n### Is $1M of protection enough if the DAO has exposure to $26M of stETH?\n\nThe spirit of this proposal is to conduct a small scale pilot, so the scale is sized accordingly. If the DAO sees value from the pilot, it could decide to scale up protection over time.\n\n### How is ownership of the deployed contracts configured?\n\n[OptimismL1Proxy](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4d6EC0e31c9177c696Fb49c2Ad04aB766e91F38f) has the [NounsDAOExecutor](https://nouns.center/dev/smart-contract-architecture) as its L1OwnerAddress. The [TokenBuyer](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xdD9e5Dab49d8394660d4Fe2383692448e3944d2b), [Payer](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xc2a9a0d746535cec8dd841651172396dea38464c), and [CozyMultiOraclePriceFeed](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x31D2CfCFD44e0e1F5c36d065E665b56B6354EA5c) have the OptimismL1Proxy set as their owner and admin. \n\nOnly the DAO can execute transactions through the OptimismL1Proxy, and only owner/admin transactions sent through the OptimismL1Proxy can be executed on the TokenBuyer, Payer, and CozyPriceFeed.",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 329 - Support Creative Commons ",
      "content": "# Support Creative Commons \n\n![Nouns x Creative Commons](https://i.imgur.com/NK23nSz.png) \n\n## Proposal\n\nCreative Commons respectfully requests 100 ETH to support the organization‚Äôs general operations and license infrastructure.\n\n## Overview\n\nYou‚Äôve likely heard of Creative Commons Zero or CC0. \n\nCC0 has taken the NFT world, especially the community-owned brand Nouns, by storm. If you‚Äôre new to CC0, it‚Äôs a \"no copyright reserved\" option in which all copyright is relinquished and dedicated to the public domain. This enables use of CC0 NFTs with zero legal repercussions, inspiring creative derivatives and remixes of original works. \n \nCC0 may be everywhere, but here‚Äôs a lesser-known fact: Creative Commons is also a whole nonprofit organization (see our most recent annual report [here](https://creativecommons.org/2023/04/11/state-of-the-commons-2022/)).  \n\nWe‚Äôve been around since 2001 and are a small but mighty team of 22 open access enthusiasts. We not only manage the CC licenses and public domain tools, we run campaigns, programming, and training in Open Education, Culture, Climate, and Journalism; host a CC Global Summit in locations around the world; and tackle major policy issues impacting the Internet and global commons as part of a broad Movement for a Better Internet.  \n\nWe‚Äôre doing a lot, but it is all in service of the CC licenses, a thriving commons, and a healthy public domain, which can be expanded instantly by contemporary creators embracing the use of CC0, a globally interoperable public domain dedication tool. Like Nouns, we‚Äôre big promoters of remix culture, and have been watching (largely from the sidelines until now!) as NFT creators bring new energy and enthusiasm to the public domain.  \n\nWe‚Äôre excited to bring our two communities together to demonstrate the staying power of open access tools like CC0 even in a technological landscape that‚Äôs rapidly changing. Nouns is a prime example of this. You‚Äôre an open-source brand merging CC0 with blockchain. Nouns demonstrates the imaginative possibilities of combining public interest tools like CC Licenses with emergent technologies.\n\n## Request\nDespite being components of longstanding and emerging technologies, CC licenses are hard to fundraise for‚Äìmost people are unaware that there‚Äôs no underlying revenue stream to maintain their legal and tech infrastructure and continue to advocate for their use. The licenses are not new tech anymore, despite constantly being used in fresh ways, and it‚Äôs challenging when most funders are more interested in flashy new projects than supporting the work those ventures build on. \n\nWe are dedicated to preserving and improving our licenses, so that they can continue to be the go-to tool for future technology and creative work. That‚Äôs why CC is seeking funding for our general operations and license infrastructure, which would allow us to sustain currently underfunded but foundational areas of work: advocating for the use and adoption of open content at all levels and in all arenas, stewarding and innovating the licensing infrastructure we provide, and training future generations of creators and open advocates. \n\nWith support from Nouns, Creative Commons can prioritize the stewardship of the tools that have unlocked access to an estimated 2 billion works over the past 20 years. We are hoping your community will support us, as our work has supported your creativity.  \n\n## Proposed Transactions\n\n[Endaoment](https://app.endaoment.org/orgs/04-3585301)\nAddress: 0x72f7ab7cd03113bd4bc332d0859e5664c79646ee\n\n",

      "title": "SIP-061 - Shark Island",
      "content": "## Intro\n\nWe at SharkDAO began as a small group determined to pool resources and bid on Nouns, eventually forming a powerful DAO that amassed some of the most iconic and valuable Nouns in the space. As our DAO grew, our members contributed to its success by creating art, stories, and lore around our Nouns. Now, we are taking a bold step forward writing the next chapter with Shark Island.\n\nFollowing our previous presentation of a Shark Island-related SIP to the community, we hoped to have finalized our strategy for converting tokens into an NFT-governance based DAO. However, new and exciting developments are in store! \n\n## Plan\nSharkDAO is evolving into a Nouns DAO fork, with the project being named Shark Island.\n\nWhy create a Nouns Fork?\n- New Community Membership & Revenue\n    - Currently the only way to join the DAO is via Sushiswap\n    - The fork creates a perpetual mechanism that supports revenue growth and facilitates new member entrance\n- Alignment\n    - Most of our contributors also build in Nouns DAO\n    - Most of our treasury value derives from historically important Nouns\n\n## North Star\n\n\nOur North Star is to establish our most prominent noun - Swim Shady. \nChampioning Swim Shady as the leading icon of the Nouns DAO ecosystem, inspiring builders and artists to explore and innovate with Shark Island in the realm of web3 and open-source systems, while leaving a transformative legacy at the crossroads of art and technology.\n\nSwim Shady's story will be written through the happenings in Shark Island.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wlwlkfG.jpg)\n\n\n\n## Art\n\nThe art for Shark Island's daily auctioned NFTs has been commissioned to a variety of artists - artist friends from the Nouns ecosystem you'll know, but also new artists have been asked to create their interpretation of nounish Sharks. We also hosted a call for art contest on twitter for artists to submit artwork.\n\nHere's a preview of the latest art: [here!](https://nft.bueno.art/share/yCsWHMqh9vOsuENDkmWZ3?key=7b85e407-8062-4811-a45d-2d8ebf4d0c78)\n\nSelected artists include: Numo, Goldy, David Horvath, Timpers, Gustavo Viselner, eBoy, Maty, Teddy Wilder, jjjjsssssnnn, Pixel Art Girl, Ser Noadz, mae, and many more.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XWMFvW5.jpg)\n\n## Fork Details\n\nShark Island is set to be a fork of the most recent NounsDAO contracts, incorporating familiar elements such as governance proposals, voting, and auctions. Additionally, it will introduce key parameter changes and new features that differentiate Shark Island from the original NounsDAO model, such as the Shark Feast mechanic.\n\n### Shark Feast Mechanic\n\nIn addition to standard ETH auctions, there will be temporary periods in which the bidding currency switches from ETH to $SHARK tokens, providing an opportunity for  SharkDAO members to redeem their $SHARK tokens for NFTs. \n\nThe project will launch in Shark Feast mode before switching to standard ETH auctions. After this initial period, Shark Feast can be turned back on at any time with any specified duration via governance proposal.\n\n### Additional Parameter Changes\n**Auctions**\n\nNew Sharks will surface for bidding 4 times per day, leading to a max supply of 1460 per year. There will not be a reserve price. This may be changed by the DAO.\n\n**Founder Rewards**\n\nThere will not be any founder rewards for Shark Island.\n\n## Website\n\nEmbark on an adventure into Shark Island with our new web application. Our team of designers and artists have developed an interface that integrates the core auction and governance functions of a Nouns fork with the lively atmosphere of SharkDAO, offering a practical experience for Shark community members and newcomers alike.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5zJ8Dly.png)\n###### Mockup by Messhup\n## Team\n\nWe've put together a team of contributors to develop, design, and launch Shark Island.\n\n- [Sasquatch](https://twitter.com/PartSasquatch)\n- [Benjamin](https://twitter.com/benjaminlatsko)\n- [Numo](https://twitter.com/numo_0)\n- [Goldy](https://twitter.com/goldypix)\n- [Messhup](https://twitter.com/messhup)\n- [Nick](https://twitter.com/nickddsn)\n- [Yungweez](https://twitter.com/yungweez703)\n- [Volky](https://twitter.com/volkyeth)\n- [Nico](https://twitter.com/evmexplorer)\n- [Joshua Fisher](https://twitter.com/JoshuaFisher)\n\n## Budget (37.1 ETH and 32,350,000 SHARK)\n\n**Artist Compensation**\n- 0.3 ETH to each artist with an accepted Shark design (**14.1 ETH Total**)\n- 50,000 SHARK to each artist with an accepted Shark design (2,350,000 SHARK Total)\n\n**Team Compensation**\n- **Volky & Messhup (8 ETH Total, 4 ETH each)**\n  - Volky: Solidity smart contract developer\n  - Messhup: Creative lead for the new website's front end\n- **Calabara (Nick and Yungweez) - 3 ETH**\n  - Website front end & smart contract support\n- **Goldy, Numo, Sasquatch, Benjamin (8 ETH Total, 2 ETH each)**\n  - Goldy & Numo: Curated all Shark artwork\n  - Sasquatch & Nico (no ETH): Managed the project\n  - Benjamin: Responsible for written creative content\n  - Joshua: (no ETH): Project Advocate\n- 30m SHARK allocated within the team\n\n**Smart Contract Funding and Community Audit**\n- 2 ETH\n  - Unused funds will be returned to the DAO\n\n**Miscellaneous Budget**\n- 2 ETH\n    - Unused funds will be returned to the DAO",

From the organizations we work with to the communities we impact, every tale stands as testament to the transformative power of Nouns.\n    - Mucho Love isn't just a platform for good deeds; we're spearheading a movement. \n    - We're not just telling stories, we're changing lives, one narrative at a time.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1Bq7MMun.jpg)\n\n\n### **OUR NEXT BIG STEPS** \nWe're set to boost our impact and carry Nouns & Mucho Love further with three significant strides:\n- **COLLABORATIONS**: To broaden Mucho Love's reach and enhance our influence, we are strategically partnering with some of the largest institutions and organizations in the world. \n    - By joining forces, we can collectively reach a larger audience, build stronger relationships, and make a profound difference to the communities we serve. \n- **FULL-TIME MEDIA TEAM**: Recognizing the value of commitment and passion, we‚Äôve established a dedicated, full-time media team.\n    - We've made the strategic choice to prioritize full-time, dedicated individuals over part-time talent, no matter how skilled.\n- **EMPOWERING CONTRIBUTORS**: A key focus for us is the empowerment of our volunteers and members, providing them with the autonomy to take charge of their own activations. \n    - This empowerment strengthens ownership, responsibility, and engagement, fueling passion for our mission while cultivating a culture of innovation and problem-solving. \n\n### **WORLD-CLASS COLLABORATORS** \nThrough our past work, **the ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®'s have become a symbol of doing good**. This has helped us connect with world-class partners.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkI6OwQD3.png)\n\nIf you don't know what **TECHO** does, **MrBeast** recently partnered with them in one of his latest philanthropy videos. You can check out the impactful collaboration [**HERE**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08wlrlPjWeE).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkma02zr3.png)\n### **WHAT STORIES WILL WE TELL?** \n- **TECHO - Building New Beginnings**: A dawn bus ride to needy communities, partnering with TECHO to build homes for impoverished families. \n    - Constructing rainwater harvesting systems and vital plumbing infrastructure, each hammer stroke echoes our commitment to a better future.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJfoIILOn.jpg)\n- **6000 BURGER DONATION** **- Feeding Hope**: Inspired by MrBeast‚Äôs record, we will cook and distribute 6,000 burgers for food-insecure communities. \n    - In partnership with [KNIFE](https://www.instagram.com/kniferd/), we transform an ordinary day into a memorable one.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkInLJIdh.jpg)\n- **SAVE THE CHILDREN - Ignite Imagination, Spark Change**: We're heading to underprivileged neighborhoods with Nounish designs and coloring books, we will facilitate education, arts, and sports workshops.   \n- **JOMPEAME - Little Warriors, Big Victories**: We will visit children courageously fighting neurological disorders, delivering crucial supplies to aid their battle.\n    - Witnessing their resilience, we're determined to help them overcome daily challenges.\n- **Canvas of Nouns: Unleashing Creativity in a Thousand Colors**: In partnership with [STAINED](https://www.instagram.com/stainedconcept/), we're donating 1000 white t-shirts to an orphanage, turning each one into a canvas for creativity. \n    - The children will use provided art supplies to paint their own designs on the t-shirts, celebrating the inner artist in each of them. \n    - The painting process will take place on a giant white textile, creating a live noggle canvas of 400-600 children expressing their creativity together. \n- **NOUNISH CHRISTMAS - Spreading Holiday Nounish-Cheer**: Organizing a Christmas dinner for underprivileged communities, we decorate a Christmas tree with a Nounish Star and themed ornaments.\n    -  Gifts, possibly including new NOUNISH FRIENDS toys, will add joy to the festive celebration.\n#### **MEMBER LED ACTIVATIONS (2-3)**\nHere's the list of ideas being considered by Mucho Love members: \n- **Homeless Care-Package Distribution**\n- **Beach Clean-Ups**\n- **Nouns-Powered Library**\n- **Nutrition, Mental Health, and Hygiene Workshops**\n- **Art Workshops**\n- **Tree Planting Campaign**\n- **Blood Donation Campaign**\n- **Nouns-Powered Children Playground**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJX3ta_v2.jpg)\n\n### **WHAT'S THE FUTURE OF MUCHO LOVE?** \n- **Global Expansion**: Our mission is set to cross borders, with organizations in Costa Rica & Colombia already showing interest. We're looking at creating an international collaboration network.\n- **Business Partnerships**: Businesses are keen on content that promotes their brand positively. We're exploring mutual beneficial partnerships to generate large-scale impact.\n- **Event-based Fundraising**: We're considering launching annual events, like a Nouns Music Festival or a Nouns Fundraising Run. These events can support Mucho Love significantly while building community and Nouns brand awareness.\n- **Brand and Impact Events**: We plan to set up large events that will both promote the Nouns brand and generate revenue for Mucho Love's operations.\n- **Sustainability Forecast**: We aim for Mucho Love to be self-sustainable by mid-2024. We're looking at attracting more partnerships, sponsorships, and using Nouns-powered events for fundraising.\n\n### **IMPACT & GROWTH**\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ2EuCvw3.png)\n### **PROBLEMS FACED**\nOver the past 10 months, we've overcome many challenges and improved our methods.\n- **Outsourcing Content Team**: We outsourced our content team, which, despite its benefits, led to notable challenges, including a limited understanding of the Nouns and Mucho Love ethos, content inconsistency, and loss of the 'magic' due to rotating personnel and equipment changes. \n    - The solution? We're now building a dedicated, full-time team that is deeply invested in our mission and platform's growth.\n- **Pre-setting all Activities & Funds**: We felt tied to our initial plans, even when other exciting possibilities appeared. \n    - Our solution is to keep some of our fund flexible. This way, we can jump on fresh opportunities that align with our mission, making our operations more adaptable and responsive.\n\n### **CONTENT STRATEGY**\nOur activations serve as a content launchpad. We will create:\n- **Short Videos**: Bite-sized activation outcome and goal overviews.\n- **Impact Leaders Podcast Interviews**: In-depth dialogues with our activation leaders.\n- **Member‚Äôs Story Clips**: Member reflections on our activities.\n- **Photographic Documentation**: Capturing the essence of each activity.\n- **Long-Format Videos**: Documenting each activation‚Äôs journey, from planning to reflection.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy9yv0wP3.png)\n### **DISTRIBUTION** \nOur collaborations with major entities expand our content's reach.\n- Their networks become extensions of ours, broadening our impact stories. In return, they get to highlight their good deeds by sharing our content. \n    - We generate and share captivating content across Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube, attracting diverse audiences with our purpose and uplifting tales. \n- The good we do spurs further content creation, establishing a growth cycle. \n    - Each partnership amplifies our reach and demonstrates the positive power of Nouns.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1g8Krw_2.png)\n\n### BUDGET \n\n### **MUCHO LOVE LED ACTIVATIONS** - 64,100 USDC\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1f55eQK3.png)\n\n\n### **COLLABORATIVE ACTIVATIONS** - 70,000 USDC\n- **TECHO** \t\n    - *House Building Campaign*\n        - Site Preparation, Building Materials, Permit & Legal Fees, Infrastructure, Furnishing, Transportation, House Amenities\t\n    - *Water Catchment System*\n        - Materials, Transportation, Replacement Filters, Cleaning Supplies, Maintenance Supplies, Water Treatment\t\n    - *Tubing Systems*\t\n        - Pipes and Fittings, Pumping System, Excavation and Installation, Water Source Development, Transportation, Maintenance Cost \n- **JOMPEAME**\n    - *Pedriatic Neurological Medical Aid*\n        - Medications, Image Testing, Lab Tests, Assistive Devices, Transportation, Physiotherapy Equipment, Specialized Medical Supplies, Dietary Supplements, Home Care Items\n- **SAVE THE CHILDREN**\t\n    - *Nounish Workshops*\n        - Clothing Supplies, Food Donations, School Supplies, Educational Workshops, Art Workshops, Sport Equipment for 1000-3000 children.\t\n\n### **Media Production & Content Creation - 25,000 USDC**\n- 25,000 USDC for content team + 12,000 USDC that were saved up from last proposal*\n    1.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 325 - ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® x Pudgy Penguins",
      "content": "# ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® x Pudgy Penguins\n\n**tldr**: NounsDAO x Pudgy Penguins collaboration for a high end toy collection on NTWRK with a percentage of profits going towards the purchase of a Noun to bring the Huddle into the DAO.  This collaboration would provide proliferation into a new market and a connection between two of the fastest growing web3 brands, including content proliferation during launch.\n\n**About Pudgy Penguins**\n\n***Toy launch*** ‚Äì Pudgy Penguins recently launched our Shark Collectible on NTWRK and sold out 150 pieces in under 3 seconds at $249 a piece. It was one of NTWRKS fastest sales on record. NTWRK features some of the most passionate physical collectors in the world and we believe exposing the Nouns brand on their platform will be a huge step forward. **On Ebay, Pudgy Sharks have resold for $750 - $1,250 a piece**.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkZgwLPdn.png)\n\nView Pudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz's unboxing of \"Shark Suit\" collectible here: https://twitter.com/pudgypenguins/status/1671987835518480386?s=20\n\nThe team also recently attended the Licensing Show highlighting all the different toy lines we are producing. See a recap video here: https://twitter.com/LucaNetz/status/1672343978958569474?s=20\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJwfqVY_n.png)\n\n\nThe Nouns version of this collectible would have a similar digital connection via the rfid chip with provenance demonstrated on the blockchain in the ethos of NounsDAO. It would come with its own custom box, integrated story, and collectible card, optimizing for the best collector experience possible.\n\n---\n\n**Why Nouns?**\n\nNouns has been the staple for decentralized brand building and we see it as the only real Web3 brand outside of Pudgy Penguins. We want to align the two best Web3 brands and IP to create a historic moment for the traditional world.\n\nDue to the cc0 nature of NounsDAO IP, Pudgy Penguins could move forward without the DAO's approval but we want this to be an official collaboration, bringing the Huddle into the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n\n**The Benefit to NounsDAO**\n\nThe extensive proliferation we had with our recent toy launch will be repeated with this launch, including extensive social media coverage, press coverage, marketing efforts from NTWRK and Pudgy Penguins through traditional channels (posters, magazines, email blasts, product seedings, etc) will bring millions of impressions to the Nouns brand.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkXXTVFd3.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk84TEF_h.png)\n\n**‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® x Pudgy Penguins Launch Plan**\n\nWe are proposing to create 499 Red Penguins and 499 Blue Penguins with the matching Nouns glasses. We would retail it for $299 and we would have a 10 total Penguins within the lot that would feature a pair of Gold glasses. The gold glasses figures will be treated as a golden ticket and will be randomly given to 10 lucky purchasers. We want to add gold plating to these gold glasses to make the value proposition even more special. \n\nWe expect this collectible to be ready for launch four months after passage of this proposal, in time for the holidays. Expected launch date is 12/08/2023. \n\n---\n**Joining NounsDAO**\n\nIn addition to the extensive proliferation that will result from this collaboration, we want the Huddle will join NounsDAO! A percentage of profit from the sale of this ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® x Pudgy Penguins toy line will be put towards buying a Noun on auction. We'll be requesting an igloo and will utilize the new NounScout.wtf site when ready to put in the request.\n\n**Team**\n\nThe Pudgy Penguins team is a team of elite brand builders and marketers. Our intent with this collaboration is to create as much exposure as possible. If you‚Äôre familiar with our brand and our success thus far you know we can do this just as good if not better than anybody else.\n\nFor more information, visit: https://pudgypenguins.com/about-us\n\n---\nWe are asking for 10 ETH to go to wallet: 0x3f8cD3cc58391E704A2A0fab2482B8116Cb9D670\n\nFunds would be used to add the 10 gold Penguins to the lot to add this special touch and gamification, which otherwise would be a huge loss leader if not covered. However, we believe it‚Äôs a necessary feature to deliver a second to none experience unlike anything previously done in the traditional collectible world. \n\nFor more about Pudgy Penguins, visit: https://pudgypenguins.com\n\nAND thank you to 87B0nes and Shan for the delegation and feedback; and thank you to Prof Werder for assisting with the proposal process and help writing the prop.",

But now it is leading a global movement that it has pioneered. They accept crypto as a form of payment in their e-commerce, have tokenized experiences, have a metaverse, and see this new market as a point of differentiation. Now they are innovators AND BUILDERS, promoting the Nouniverse to all their stakeholders.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jZkSfr9.png)    \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HDOViNt.png)   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rSak9r8.png)   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DftqMcA.gif)   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DxPb6M0.png)    \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2gdcu5z.png)   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2EpTwZL.gif)   \n\nShout out to the amazing network of collaborators that believed in the cc0 culture, joined forces and made it all possible:\n\nfabioseva.eth (Coordination and Design), jp.‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® (Operations and Marketing), Narcose (Beer Production), Viking (Malt and Hop Supplier), [Buidler.it](http://buidler.it/) (NFT Launchpad), [Voidge.com](http://voidge.com/) (Metaverse Development), [BPague.com](http://bpague.com/) (Crypto Payment Gateway), BTC Pizza Day Porto Alegre (Event), NFT Brasil (Event), Foodnouns (Funding) Cryptoadz (Funding), Lens Protocol (Handles Giveaway)\n\n## An opportunity to scale üåê\n***\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IJHYa1z.png)\nThe first phase proved that beer is an excellent product to start proliferation on a global scale. We are seeking funding to expand our actions in 3 complementary strategic directions:\n\n1. New regions üìç\n2. Proper marketing in Brazil üáßüá∑\n3. New product categories üëÄ   \n\n**1) New regions üìç**    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/4iKllzi.png)\nNarcose is already part of a network of regular collaborative breweries, through which it markets its beers in the US and Europe. We will take Public Good Beer to these markets, also integrating them into our onboarding ecosystem and turning them into real Nouns builders.\n\nWe are asking for 4500 USDC amount, enough for label printing, marketing material, initial sample distribution (est. 500 cans of beer), and post-production FOR EACH of our partners:\n\nStillwater Brewery (Seattle) üá∫üá∏\nAgainst the Grain (Kentucky) üá∫üá∏\nWooden Ship (Minneapolis) üá∫üá∏\nBrewski (Sweden) üá∏üá™\nBierol (Austria) üá¶üáπ\nCanil (Portugal) üáµüáπ\n\nNote that the goal is to catalyst a collaborative beer that will be sold as part of the brewery‚Äôs portfolio, not to distribute it only at a single event. The funding is an incentive to kickstart production and marketing and involves a commitment from the brewery.\n\n**BUDGET: 6x 4500 = 27000 USDC**   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jvG8dTb.png)\n**2) Proper marketing in Brazil üáßüá∑**\n\nInternational expansion will not be instantaneous, as it demands a free schedule in the industry. In this period, we take advantage of the existing inventory of over 3000 cans produced.\n\nDespite the success of Phase 1, we believe we haven‚Äôt reached full IRL proliferation potential for such a pioneer project. We had 0.5 ETH for everything (sub 300 cans, and very short-scale marketing activation). Thus, the proposed expansion would bring the deserved impact and tons of resources for further promotion of the Nouniverse.\n\nThe next 2 biggest crypto weeks in Brazil happen in August (during NFTRio) and September (Blockchain Rio, which connected the Brazilian Nouns community IRL for the first time). We are asking 4500 USDC for each week to make a big impact at main and side events, including:\n\n* Public Good Beer distribution\n* Marketing materials (shirts, stickers, temporary tattoos)\n* Activations (POAP distribution, treasure hunts, giveaways)\n* Professional quality media production\n* We are asking for 4500 USDC for each week.\n\n**BUDGET: 2x 4500 = 9000 USDC**   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DbzkhNr.gif)\n**3) New product categories üëÄ**\n\nBeyond beer, we have the opportunity to extend the portfolio to two synergic brands/categories:\n\na) BBQ sauces - for the weekly beer-fueled barbecues we do all around Brazil; and\nb) Sunscreen - for our 7637 km of coastline, full of bikinis, surf stars and sunglasses ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\nWe would like to allocate a total budget of 5000 USDC to work this as the project progresses. Alongside with this we also have the coordination and maintenance of the activities during period of 6 months at a cost of 6000 USDC.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p6Hr6hb.png)\n\n**BUDGET: 11000 USDC**   \n\n**TEAM**\n\nfabioseva.eth\njp.‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\nWe are very excited to keep spreading the CC0 culture and bringing companies on board with us. A huge shoutout and heartfelt thanks to everyone who‚Äôs supporting the project either online and IRL. Don‚Äôt forget to follow [@PublicGoodBeer](https://twitter.com/publicgoodbeer) on Twitter for all the latest updates. Cheers to a future of collaboration and doing good!\n\n**TOTAL ASK = 47000 USDC (~25 ETH)**   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1VrFZjh.gif)   \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5zXWf6M.gif)   \n\n***\n_Sponsor's Note: (ccarella.eth)_    \nAs an enthusiast for Public Goods, I am thrilled to sponsor this proposal onchain. It's incredibly satisfying to witness a tangible representation of the Public Goods brand. With its CC0 recipe, distinctive branding, and collaboration with various breweries, this project stands out as an innovative venture that extends the reach of the meme. It also encourages people to contemplate the importance of both CC0 and Public Goods.",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 322 - Nounify Korea - stamp collection campaign",
      "content": "# Nounify Korea - stamp collection campaign\n\n*Proposer note: I am happy be helping @fiveoceans_dev, @jheeart_nft, and @_duckhead get this onchain. I think this is a fun, sort of grassroots, small-is-big proliferation effort from a team that is highly committed to Nouns and has done quality work in the past.*\n \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkFD93zdn.jpg)\n### TL;DR\n- We propose to launch a stamp-collecting campaign to nounify Korea.\n- Our primary objective is to establish Nouns as a prominent pop culture brand.\n- By collaborating with coffee shops and utilizing Nouns' CC0 content, we can maximize Nouns' exposure and provide incentives for fans.\n- To achieve this, we kindly request $65,000 or around $4,600 per location to promote nouns at 10+ coffee shops, 2 retail stores, and 2 art galleries over the next three months.\n\n### Description\nWe have observed the success of Nouns' flywheel in Brazil, China, Japan, and other communities. We propose to launch activation campaign in Korea in collaboration with ten authentic coffee shops. This campaign aims to educate people about nouns and engage them in the process. Participants will collect noggle-stamps and have the chance to earn stylish nounish t-shirts as rewards.\n\nOur team firmly believes in our energy and talent to establish Nouns as a prominent pop culture brand in Korea. The campaign will span three months, during which people will receive noggle-stamps with their coffee purchases. Once they collect 10 stamps, they can exchange a coupon card for a nounish t-shirt.\n\nTo ensure widespread exposure, all coffee shops will display posters, t-shirts, and magazines featuring on-chain proposals. Furthermore, these t-shirts will be available for purchase at retail stores and art galleries. We are committed to creating high-quality t-shirts using nounish cc0 content, with additional approval from the artists involved.\n\nFor the successful activation of the nouns community in Korea and the promotion of Nouns in 10+ locations over three months, we kindly request $65,000 in funding.\n\n### The stamp collection campaign\n![](https://i.imgur.com/51HGjJe.jpg)\n\nThe campaign will focus on creating visibility, engaging local community, and establishing a loyal fan base. The coffee shops will become a place for people to gather and learn about nouns through arts on t-shirts and information in magazines.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1e0gbXuh.png)\n\nCoupon cards featuring nouns will be distributed at the coffee shops' counters. We anticipate each coffee shop to distribute around 50-30 coupon cards daily, totaling approximately 27,000 cards throughout the campaign. In our focused campaign, we will give out special coupon cards that need only 2 stamps to people who are interested in blockchain and NFTs through our network of friends.\n\n### T-shirts\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByDeX5Md3.jpg)\n\nT-shirts will be placed in highly visible areas at coffee shops. We'll use Nouns' cc0 content to create a beautiful collection of t-shirts. Our goal is to pleasantly surprise everyone with the quality and spirit of nounish artworks. These t-shirts will be made from scratch specifically for this campaign from high-quality materials and tailored in various styles for both men and women. Each label and tag will feature Noggles and links to Noun's homepage and Twitter account.\n\nWe will strategically strive to get the t-shirts in the hands of pop stars, actors, musicians, and models.\n\nThe t-shirts will be the same as those for prop173, 'Sail in NY,' that received praise from the community for their quality.\n\n### NOUNS.WTF magazine\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkFD93zdn.jpg)\n\nWe propose creating a NOUNS.WTF magazine as a powerful marketing and storytelling tool to convey the campaign's message. The magazine will be cost-effective to design using Canva templates and nounish CC0 content. The magazines will be distributed at partner coffee shops and serve as a guide to NounsDAO.\n\nThe magazine will feature articles about: \n- campaign\n- t-shirt collection\n- top on-chain proposals\n- nounish subdaos\n- overview of government clients.\n- We invite individuals and subdaos to contribute to the magazine's creation. Contact us on Twitter to publish an article or a post ([Nouns Seoul](https://twitter.com/nounsseoul)).\n\n### Coffee shops and other partner properties\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1Zj0T5u3.jpg)\n\nWe are going to collaborate with authentic coffee shops around Seoul. Here are the links to coffee shops located in popular areas such as [Jeongno](https://www.instagram.com/cha.teul/), [Itaewon](https://www.instagram.com/theroyalfad/), and [Sinsa](https://www.instagram.com/minoscoffeecult/). Additionally, we are going to sell t-shirts at popular [Fashion and lifestyle](https://www.instagram.com/niceweather.seoul/) goods stores and [art galleries](https://www.instagram.com/print_bakery/).\n\nAs of now, we onboarded three coffee shops, one retail store, and one art gallery. We can rest of the partner properties recruited in no time.\n\n### Why Korea\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJUNQsvw2.jpg)\n\nKorea is known for its collection of cool nounish items, ranging from sailboats, resin toys, and children's books to motorcycles. In line with this, our goal is to unite and provide a firsthand experience to an increasing number of Nouns' fans. We believe that the timing is ideal to launch a nounish campaign, aiming to showcase the beautiful aspects of Nouns' art, culture, and governance. This initiative will not only attract a larger base of devoted fans but also facilitate the discovery of new nounish memes and contribute to the advancement of nounish culture.\n\n### Timeline\nThe campaign is scheduled to commence in July and continue until October. The team estimates that it will require approximately 3-4 weeks to complete all the necessary preparations.\n1 week - legal matters\n1 week - coffee shop recruitment\n1 week - decorations/logistics\n3 weeks - manufacture 2,000 t-shirts\n3 weeks - design and print NOUNS.WTF magazine\n\n### The team\n1. **[Fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)** t-shirts manufacturing and distribution\n2. **[Morph](https://www.instagram.com/morphmgmt/)** - legal matters and work with coffee shops.\n3. **[Jhee](https://twitter.com/jheeart_nft)** NOUNS.WTF magazine\n4. **[Duckhead](https://twitter.com/_duckhead)** coffee shops decorations\n\n### Budget\n$35,000 - manufacture 2,000 t-shirts (custom tags with noggles, different styles, artwork press, packaging)\n$10,000 - coffee shops' rental fees (10 coffee shops, 3 months, $330 per month)\n$4,000 - NOUNS.WTF magazine design and printing\n$2,500 - logistics & storage (Ex. 100 t-shirts weight 22 kg or 48 pounds)\n$2,500 - legal, tax, signing contracts with coffee shops, outsourcing  company's fees to conduct business etc\n$3,000 - decorations $300 per coffee shop (10 t-shirt stands, 100 posters, 10 noggle stamps, 27,000 coupon cards, and others)\n$2,000 - photo & video production to document progress and share on SNS\n$6,000 - team's compensation.

The user questions that Mogu tackles are: ‚Äú*Who is 0x34ab..ef2? What do they do in the world of Nouns?*‚Äù, or broadly ‚Äú*What‚Äôs happening in Nouns right now?*‚Äù. As time goes on, there will be more and more participants and complexity to Nouns, for the only option currently to answer these questions is some messy mix of Etherscan, Agora, Google, and various governance clients. **Mogu combines all these into one interface for power users.**\n\nMogu currently parses every Nouns vote, delegation, bid, transfer, settlement, and proposal in a human readable and accessible way. As soon as any of these events happen, Mogu creates custom [transaction pages](https://www.mmmogu.com/tx/0xa26822afab95bb53d185b0daab703b64fae597cf818ef63428cdeb8068d1b2ac) and [address pages](https://mmmogu.com/address/nounders.eth). I‚Äôve also built other features like a delegation table and a vote-planning board.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1lv66Esu3.png)\n\n\nUsage is somewhat comparable to voter.wtf so far - 700 visitors and 2,000 page views in the last month.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 320 - Treasury Diversification: Swap 500 wstETH -> rETH via TWAMM",
      "content": "# Treasury Diversification: Swap 500 wstETH -> rETH via TWAMM\n\n### tldr;\n\nThere‚Äôs been interest in diversifying [Nouns DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10), specifically `stETH => rETH`, and we have built a tool that‚Äôs tailor-made to help execute these trades:¬†*TWAMM.* The trade will be executed completely on-chain, transparently with very low fees and minimal gas costs. \n\nThe first trade will be for $1M, and after that completes successfully, a larger $14M trade will be proposed.\n\n## **Background**\n\nTWAMM is a concept introduced by¬†[Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/07/twamm)¬†in July 2021. \"It works by breaking long-term orders into infinitely many infinitely small pieces and executing them against an embedded constant-product AMM smoothly over time.\" \n\nAn on-chain AMM protocol to enable large token swaps is essential to increase DeFi adoption and anti-fragility. Some interesting use cases for TWAMMs include¬†[treasury diversification](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1502177286170185735)*,*¬†[whale liquidations](https://twitter.com/solendprotocol/status/1538553654575214592)*,*¬†[peg maintenance](https://www.notion.so/fd88cb37208d4b0f9abaca4e276f9ddd?pvs=21)*, etc*.\n\nWe have been researching and developing TWAMMs since November 2021 and recently launched our protocol: [CronFi TWAMM](https://twitter.com/cronfinance/status/1645802789006876672). The code has been audited by SpearbitDAO, open-sourced, and verified on Etherscan. Considerable detail about the protocol is presented on the [docs page](https://docs.cronfi.com/twamm/).\n\n## **Product Design & Incentives**\n\n- AMM: we built our TWAMM as a custom pool on top of Balancer V2 Vault leveraging the¬†*security, liquidity, flexibility, and gas advantages*¬†of Balancer. Additionally, Balancer has become a Schelling point for protocols that want to leverage their AMM, thus creating network effects & composability advantages.\n- Traders: as a long-term trader (Nouns DAO), you only have to pay gas for starting, canceling, or withdrawing proceeds from your order. All the other sub-orders of the DCA are done virtually and cost the Nouns DAO no gas fees. Virtual orders are only written on-chain when the next user interacts with the protocol (generally an arbitrageur).\n- Arbitrageurs: as seen on other AMMs like Uniswap, arbitrageurs are important to keep the price of the assets in line with external venues. Arbitrageurs are critical for TWAMMs because trade sizes are significantly larger and last for multiple blocks. Therefore we have built and partnered with dedicated arbitrageurs (BloXRoute) to ensure pools are arbitraged frequently to ensure Nouns DAO gets the best swap return.\n- Liquidity: there will be a minimum of $30k liquidity in the pools and we expect that to reach between $50-100k in liquidity before the trade executes. TWAMMs are extremely capital efficient given that the trades are split across multiple blocks and arbitrageurs are consistently bringing new liquidity back to the system to correct price deviations ‚Äî simulation details below illustrate these efficiencies and swap performance.\n\n## **Advantages**\n\n- Low fees: wstETH/rETH is a stable pair and long-term swappers pay a one-time¬†**0.03% fee.**\n- Fully on-chain: zero dependencies on off-chain services, oracles, compute etc.\n- Flexible: issue, withdraw, and cancel orders with ease.\n    - Example new order:¬†`sell 7_500 stETH for rETH in 100_000 blocks` ~roughly 2 weeks\n    - Helpful periphery contract to issue orders\n- Full control of orders and assets: non-custodial, cancellable, and withdraw proceeds at any time.\n- Withdraw multiple times: users can withdraw once at the end, or every set number of blocks ‚Äì they just pay gas fees.\n- DCA over 1000‚Äôs of blocks gas-free: Nouns DAO would only pay gas for starting and ending suborders; arbitrageurs pay for placing suborders on-chain.\n- Analytics: we will have an analytics dashboard that shows how the order is being filled so the DAO can monitor the trade. There will also be a post-trade analysis and report.\n- Monitoring: we will be actively monitoring the trade as the `delegate` to ensure the order is being filled at a reasonable price. In case the trade escapes a reasonable threshold, we will cancel the trade on behalf of the DAO, refunding proceeds and the remaining unsold portion of the order to the Nouns DAO wallet.\n\n## **Risks**\n\n- Smart contract:\n    - Fully audited: see SpearbitDAO report [here](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/pdfs/CronFinance-Spearbit-Security-Review.pdf).\n    - Hack Risks: built on Balancer V2 Vaults which have been battle-tested for 2+ years.\n    - Bricked Pools: we‚Äôve done extensive research and mitigations for gas, order DDoS, numerical underflows, incorrect TWAMM parameters etc ‚Äì more info here:¬†[0slippage](https://mirror.xyz/0slippage.eth).\n    - Loss of Funds: open-source code, audited, verified, non-custodial, users in full control of funds, trade happens over multiple blocks so it can be canceled at any time by the user.\n    - Malicious Pool Admin: all pool administrators can do is pause the pool or change fees at which point Nouns DAO can cancel and withdraw their funds.\n- Lack of Arbitrage: we have built a flash swap arbitrage bot and also teamed up with BloXroute to provide a dedicated arbitrage service.\n- Poor Execution: orders are cancellable at any time i.e if the price escapes preferred bounds restart the order at another time. Also, DCA is generally a better strategy than spot purchase for large orders.\n- Information Leakage: this is not a big concern for a stable pair like wstETH/rETH which are like assets and have deep liquidity pools.\n- MEV/Sandwich Attacks: orders are broken into small pieces and thus the benefit of front/back running orders is minimal ‚Äì see the Paradigm paper for further details.\n\n## **Competition**\n\nHere are the alternatives and how they stack up against TWAMM. Note this isn‚Äôt a comprehensive list, but a short summary.\n\n- Gnosis Auction:\n    - Pros: well-tested technology\n    - Cons: reliant on well-funded keepers, minimum buy lots, price upside capped, infrastructure overhead, limited timeframe, poor execution vs DCA over long periods.\n- Manual DCA:\n    - Pros: can execute it today\n    - Cons: need to write a smart contract or fat finger mistakes, fees for each sub-order, gas costs of sub-orders, limited # of sub-orders\n- DEX:\n    - Pros: complete trade in a single block\n    - Cons: poor liquidity, slippage, MEV attack vectors\n- Aggregators\n    - Pros: access to liquidity, completes trade quickly\n    - Cons: not on-chain, MEV attack vectors, slippage\n- OTC:\n    - Pros: limit orders and other novel trade execution algorithms\n    - Cons: off-chain, opaque, high fees, custodial, KYC, regulations, etc\n\n## Trade Simulations\n\nHere are the simulation results for the trade and expected returns. The initial trade is to show Nouns DAO the power of the protocol and ensure everything works as expected. This simulation is an approximation and results might vary based on liquidity, prices, volatility, etc. We will be monitoring the trade to ensure the trade fills won‚Äôt deviate drastically from the expected outcome. \n\n*NOTE*: this is a full contract simulation between a Balancer pool and our contract, using a fixed wstETH:rETH price in the balancer pool, fixed gas units, and fixed USD exchange rates. The simulation is executed with the actual contracts, with certain parameters held constant to evaluate the effect of liquidity and arbitrage frequency on swap performance.\n\n### $1M trade with $100k liquidity: 1.327% slippage\n\n![$1M Trade](https://file.notion.so/f/s/cc37a59f-9774-4859-a61c-69f8ee99fc0f/Untitled.png?id=af6d81b7-0b73-459b-bb0d-c6cafd2546d8&table=block&spaceId=7e9c2097-8472-4264-8933-88a90befa953&expirationTimestamp=1688119200000&signature=-LrcBvyt3f3UR6P-R3vrIOmejvImtapnsevhYmY6-yM&downloadName=Untitled.png)\n\nLPs make **1.537% ($1537)** from fees in a week, if you‚Äôre interested in adding liquidity to the pool to earn fees, you can add liquidity here: [wstETH <> rETH TWAMM Pool](https://www.app.cronfi.com/pools/0x6910C4e32D425a834Fb61e983C8083a84b0EBd01). Here‚Äôs how swap performance improves as liquidity and arbitrage frequency increase in the pool. \n![Slippage vs Liquidity](https://file.notion.so/f/s/38b87f1a-e59a-42ab-8477-50eff845de50/Untitled.jpeg?id=00633ae7-1372-4f0a-96dc-87b8a3241a95&table=block&spaceId=7e9c2097-8472-4264-8933-88a90befa953&expirationTimestamp=1688104800000&signature=ZFT7TUSzr2-CoDAk20NjvH_nq4iKvwqXNmleE0QYEys&downloadName=Untitled.jpeg)\n\nThe real benefit is in the larger trade which does better than any on-chain solution and even Cowswap‚Äôs quotes. Additionally, LPs would make **1.545% ($21,626)** from fees in a week\n\n### $14M trade with $1.4M liquidity: 0.553% slippage\n\n![$14M Trade](https://file.notion.so/f/s/58005a86-ccbf-4242-964b-f61d1a3d8f3c/Untitled.png?id=8901e138-7e97-4fd4-a06f-f1647147aa9a&table=block&spaceId=7e9c2097-8472-4264-8933-88a90befa953&expirationTimestamp=1688126400000&signature=TTPdCodz5QByagmT-VhmdZev_6Z6NZNlGwFhx-PzmCY&downloadName=Untitled.png)\n\n## **Proposal Operations**\n\nThis proposal requires two on-chain proposals. The first will be a trial trade for $1M wstETH ‚Üí rETH. The follow-up proposal will trade $14M wstETH ‚Üí rETH. \n\nNote: we‚Äôre wrapping more stETH than we are selling because the price fluctuates, we want to ensure the proposed amounts of wstETH are available to sell.\n\n1. (We are here) `sell 500 wstETH for rETH in 50_400 blocks` ~1 week\n2. (Follow up) `sell 7000 wstETH for rETH in 50_400 blocks` ~ 1 week",

      "content": "# Nerman.js\n\n\n---\n\n## TLDR\n\n---\n\n93 ETH to continue development of [Nerman.js - Nouns SDK](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js) and the Nounish event feed discord bot.\n\n![Nerman](https://i.imgur.com/bZhHfhr.png)\n\n---\n\n## INTRO\n\n---\n\nNerman was funded by Nouns DAO through [Prop 77](https://nouns.wtf/vote/77). Our team has been hard at work programming Nerman's various bots and libraries since then. Check out [nerman.wtf](https://nerman.wtf) for a summary of the project and links to the various code repositories.\n\nIn this proposal we focus our efforts on Nerman.js ([GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerman)), and Nounish feeds using our Discord bot ([GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman)).\n\n---\n\n## NERMAN.JS - NOUNS SDK\n\n---\n\nNerman.js provides simple type-safe access to Nouns DAO contract events, as well as custom events such as Noun O'Clock. The user provides a JSON-RPC url and connects directly to an Ethereum node without any further 3rd party hosted services.\n\nYou can install Nerman.js with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nerman)\n\n**DEMO - NOUN O'CLOCK**\n\n``` typescript\nimport * as nerman from \"nerman\";\n\nconst Nouns = new nerman.Nouns( JSON_RPC_API_URL );\n\nNouns.on(\"AuctionEnd\", (data : nerman.EventData.AuctionEnd) => {\n    \n    // It's Noun O'Clock, do stuff here!!\n\n});\n```\n\nFor more code examples see the ReadMe in [GitHub](https://github.com/JoeCars/Nerman.js). Nerman.js currently supports listening to Nouns DAO events such as auction creation, auction bids, proposal creation, dao votes, Noun creation, Noun transfer, delegation changes, and more. We also launched support for [Nouns Nymz](https://nouns.nymz.xyz/) and have a live feed posting in a Nouns community Discord.\n\n**THE FUTURE**\n\nNerman.js will provide and maintain access to events across the Nouniverse:\n\n- Nouns DAO events across all contracts, including DAO updates (v3) and DAO tools (token buyer)\n- Various events from Nounish projects and tools like Prop House, Nouns Nymz, Federation, Agora, etc. \n- Contract events from Nounish DAOs (Lil Nouns, Gnars, Builder DAO)\n\nNerman.js will index on-chain Nouns data:\n\n- Pre-indexed Nouns data included with library for instant access\n- Manually run the indexer yourself for verification\n- This indexed data allows Nerman to offer more complicated analysis of the data, including reporting behavior of voters, bidders, vote participation rates, etc.\n\nNerman.js will be a canonical source of knowledge about the Nouniverse:\n\n- Our extensive, SEO optimized documentation will help people figure out what Nouns contracts and projects exist and how to best interact with them. Our resources will be a useful starting point for anyone developing in Nouns.\n\n\n---\n\n## DISCORD BOT - NOUNISH FEEDS\n\n---\n\nNerman offers customizable Nounish event feeds for Discord channels, displaying formatted embeds with the main Nouns DAO contract events from Nerman.js. Users can configure which events to display in a channel with a simple command.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyX8b1U_3.jpg)\n\n**CURRENT NOUNISH FEEDS**\n\n- **Agora Discord**\n  Auction and DAO Proposal events in #gov-updates channel\n- **A Nouns Community Discord**\n  Auction and Proposal events in #general channel\n  Nouns Nymz posts in #nouns-nymz\n- **Nouncil**\n  Auctions, Proposals, Token Transfers in Feeds Section\n  Proposal votes and status changes posted in appropriate Prop threads in #nouncil-votes\n\n  \n\n**THE FUTURE**\n\nWe will add all Nerman.js events as we create them, allowing easy Discord notifications from Prop House, Federation, other Nounish DAO's, and anywhere else we can get event feeds from. We will also experiment with different feed ideas using the events we have, for instance creating a feed that only displays Nouns DAO votes with 0 vote weight as an informal on-chain chat.\n\nWe will also develop a way for automated Nouns DAO prop discussions using forums, where a new thread is automatically created for each proposal.\n\n---\n\n## TERMS\n\n---\n\n- funding for the team to continue developing Nerman up to Dec 31, 2023. \n- all code will be open source and released under a permissive license (such as MIT).\n\n---\n\n## TRANSACTION\n\n---\n\n**Total Budget: 93 Œû**\nJoel Cares (part time) and a team of 2 devs (full time)\n\n**Transaction**\n93 ETH streamed to 0x09b68020Fb9691C2c20687631EDCF16fdFCba277",

The group includes esteemed directors, including:\n\nRidley Scott, a globally recognized figure in the industry.\nAntony Crook, known for directing and editing a series of Porsche films titled \"Sound and Driven,\" which revolve around the iconic Larrabee studios in Los Angeles.\n\nJonas √Ökerlund, who directed the Netflix feature film 'Polar' based on a graphic novel, reaching 130 million subscribers and claiming the top spot on iMDb MovieMeter for two consecutive weeks. Jonas' commercial work has received accolades such as Addy, Cannes Gold Lion, and Cannes Grand Prix Awards. He has also garnered numerous Grammy Awards and an Emmy nomination for his contribution to Beyonc√©'s visual album 'Lemonade.'\n\nJake Scott, renowned for directing Nike's Emmy-winning commercial 'Move' and REM's award-winning music video for 'Everybody Hurts.'\n\nA complete list of directors associated with the group can be found at the following link: https://rsafilms.com/eu/directors\n\nAnother notable individual to be introduced to NounsDAO during CFA is Philipp Ulita, also a jury member at CFA and the CEO of Berlin Commercial and Berlin Fashion Film Festival, two esteemed industry festivals in Europe (https://www.instagram.com/berlinfashionfilmfestival/).\n\nThe objective is to acquaint top-tier film directors and professionals in the advertising industry with a new model for exploring, funding, producing, and delivering creative content.\n\nUntil now, the NounsDAO model has primarily been explored by its own ecosystem members, individuals involved in the Nouns community. Our proposal aims to extend this community and model to a different audience ‚Äì a highly skilled and globally accomplished group of professionals who maintain strong relationships with renowned brands such as Nike, Porsche, Gillette, Vogue, Carhartt, Audi, BMW, Prada, and many others.\n\n \n![Screenshot_2023-06-27_at_22.16.04.jpg](ipfs://bafybeignvnr5og7x6hn42mc54byatrn6jr4qx46s2ew5u3pt33xkkv4wnq)\n    \n\nMeasures of success\nIntroducing NounsDAO and their model to influential brands and industry professionals like the scouting advisor at Vogue Italia and Cond√© Nast Sara Sozzani Maino, the news editor of Shots Daniel Huntley, the executive producer and partner at HENRY Hugo Diaz, the directors rep at Ridley Scott‚Äô RSA and former Senior Editor at NOWNESS Marley Hansen.  \n\n \n![Screenshot_2023-06-27_at_22.16.24.jpg](ipfs://bafybeido4nx3ekiaztx7ilctkouhdcdsmh6icyew3srv4ouayqz7724bru)\n    \n\nProposed action\nUtilize NounsDAO-funded content, such as informative Nounish videos like  What is Nouns DAO and How Does it Work? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa79nN4gMPs to introduce the CFA audience to the NounsDAO model and ecosystem.

Build Nouns Bowling as a Lead Title\nNouns Bowling is a new 3D bowling game built with CC0 assets from the [3D Nouns](https://3dnouns.com) and [Noun Sounds](https://nounsounds.wtf) projects. This game is LIVE on the [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nouns-bowling/id1660679079) today!\n\nBowling is popular on **all gaming platforms** and can blaze a trail for publishing multi-platform Nouns games. Bowling is an approachable, universal game and appeals to all age groups.\n\n### üëâ Play Nouns Bowling: [nounsbowling.app](https://nounsbowling.app)\n![Nouns Bowling](https://i.imgur.com/xqmhQNc.jpg)\n\n[![Nouns Bowling](https://i.imgur.com/5TKGiiU.jpg)](https://youtu.be/A-FBNGRYy4A)\n\nWATCH VIDEO: [Nouns Bowling trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-FBNGRYy4A&list=PLQLUWbPbAeHEdkgI9PFPj7lShFrCg_iPI&index=1)\n\n### Here‚Äôs what the funding is for:\n- **Core technology** - build key technology for the other games here\n- **3D Art and Animation** - expand the game and boost production values\n- **Metagame** - features to wrap core gameplay, reusable in other games\n- **Teams feature** - adding team competition between Nouns houses\n- **Prizes feature** - adding prize competitions for game nights\n\n‚≠ê *Includes new 3D bowling alleys for Nouns communities:*\n\n* **Nouns Alley** - the original alley for the OG Nouns\n* **Lil Nouns Lanes** - a big bowling alley for the Lil Nouns\n* **FOODNOUNs Bowl** - tasty environment with an OTG angle\n* **Gnarly Bowl** - a gnarly alley for extreme bowling athletes\n\n---\n\n## Part 2. Establish the Nouns CC0 Gaming Toolkit\nAs we build Nouns Bowling, we'll create the **Nouns CCO Gaming Toolkit**:\n\n* **3D Nouns characters** - game-ready Unity assets based on [3D Nouns](https://3dnouns.com)\n* **2D Nouns characters** - game-ready Unity assets from [Nouns Sprite Sheets](https://nouns.wtf/vote/201)\n* **Famous Characters** - famous Nouns NPC characters with AI features\n* **Nouns 3D environments** - models and other 3D assets \n* **Useful Unity systems** - to help devs build Nouns games quickly\n\n### Competitive Advantage for Nouns\nNo traditional games business would release 3D characters, environments and gaming IP into the public domain. **What if Mario was a CC0 brand?** ü§Ø\n\n![Nouns 3D Characters in Unity](https://i.imgur.com/6eGYUvg.gif)\n\nüï∫ Game-ready **3D Nouns** ready to rock\n\n### ‚≠ê Including this BONUS item ...\n![Rose Parade Nouns Float](https://i.imgur.com/FVe75yc.jpg)\n\n![Rose Parade Nouns Float](https://i.imgur.com/PdwSIRV.png)\n\nüöß 3D model of the Rose Parade Float - as seen in Nouns Bowling üöß\n\n### Rose Parade float CC0 asset:\n- Game-ready Unity package with characters and animations\n- FBX assets for use in Blender or other game engines like Unreal\n- Rendered images for use in videos or on websites\n\n‚≠ê *Just one example of a useful Nouns 3D gaming asset!*\n\n---\n\n## Part 3. Fire Up a Game Publishing Pipeline üî•\n### Process for prototyping and shipping Nouns games\nCompetition in games is fierce - only the **top games** in each genre survive. Two ways to win: be a top game in an existing genre, or create a **new game genre**. \n\nLots of prototyping, with rounds of cuts, is the method used by savvy game businesses.\n\n### Pipeline Steps\n1. **Proposals** - generate new ideas and proposals\n2. **Prototypes** - build prototypes for web\n3. **Betas** - fund betas for web and iOS\n4. **Ship** - ship top games on web, mobile\n5. **Publish** - take Nouns games to new gaming platforms\n\n![Nouns Publishing Pipeline](https://i.imgur.com/0Z8HLPr.png)\n\nThis game publishing pipeline is designed to deliver a **stream of prototypes** to playtest, while attracting new builders to Nouns. \n\nThis proposal delivers **12 prototypes** and **6 winners** will be pubished as iOS apps.\n\n---\n\n## Part 4.

      "content": "# Nouns : A Movie - Chapter 2 ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\n[![](https://i.postimg.cc/HxD7MSxR/1231.png)](https://nouns.movie)\n### Tl;dr:\n*[Nouns Movie](https://nouns.movie/) Pilot episode with runtime of 4:30 mins released on June 21st, 2023*\n\nThis specific prop is seeking funding to create **Episode 2 with a run-time of 10.5 -11 mins** delivered at the end of 100 days.

But when an audacious 13-year-old Noun discovers the plot of the ruthless frowns to use an updated version of the Noggles to enslave its citizens, he has to team up with an unlikely band of misfits to save the ones they love.*\n\n**Genre**: Action, Comedy\n\nScript for the delivered Pilot can be found [***here***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fMSljVpvuS8VbHfesNS_D9Z6IFjrNkO1/view)\n\nWe also created a rough outline of how the story progresses through completion.

      "content": "# Expanding Global Distribution of Lo-Fi Noggles\n\nAs a veteran manufacturer in the Nouns ecosystem, [NOUNWORKS](https://twitter.com/nounworks) has a proven pipeline for delivering quality products. We would like to place Noggles onto the faces of every Nounish person on the planet. We are requesting funding to create another run of Lo-Fi Noggles. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkK1-Kqr3.jpg)\n*25K+ Lo-Fi Noggles to supply large-scale IRL events*\n\n# STEP 1: Decide who gets what\n\nWith this production run we plan on outfitting various active members of the global Nouns community so that their IRL events are even more Nounish. \n\nWe will survey groups to understand their needs, and we will accept requests and inquiries from people writing props or planning events. \n\n**Note that this survey has already begun in the Discourse [here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/worldwide-lo-fi-noggles-everey-where-reorder/4674) and many groups have already confirmed a strong interest in receiving shipments of the Lo-Fi Noggles:**\n\n**Nouns Running:** *\"As the founder of the Nouns Running Club, I can say that we REALLY need these. We had a small batch of 30 donated by another grantee, and they went like hotcakes. People really liked them and it was a good way for people to feel good after a run and they just GOT the good vibes.\"*\n\n**Pizza DAO:** *\"Was incredibly excited to be able to distribute these at our Global Pizza Event. Also, having them at our events offered another layer of experience for our party attendees by offering them as a ‚Äúprop-for-participation‚Äù (it was great for attendees to be able to jump in a photo or video and play ‚Äúpass the noggles,‚Äù etc‚Ä¶while meeting up for some pizza). Enjoy the energy this can bring to events all over! Would love to get a bunch for future events!\"*\n\n**Mucho Love:** *\"Lo-Fi Noggles are more than just fun cardboard eyewear for Mucho Love. They serve as a tangible manifestation of the spirit and ethos of our organization. As we engage in our various activations, these Noggles serve as an icebreaker, a conversation starter, and a symbol of our commitment to spreading joy and positivity. They enhance our content‚Äôs recognizability, making it stand out and resonate with audiences familiar with Nouns. They are instrumental in fostering community, spreading our message, and enhancing the impact of our work.\"\"*\n\n**Serpunk:** *I think this is a good idea. A low budget option to nounify any event should exist and I believe this is it!*\n\n**Nouns in Rio:** *\"We definitely need those for Nouns in Rio/NounsBR events!*\n\n**Nouns Amigos:** *\"Noggles set the vibes for any IRL event! Definitely needed for Nouns Amigos community ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\"*\n\n**Gnars:** *\"Be very keen to reserve 2500 pieces for Gnars and Art Haus related events!\"*\n\n**Nouns Whisky:** *\"this is awesome! We could distribute 3000 of them.\"*\n\n\n\n[MANY more positive reactions and support / requests for this prop here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/worldwide-lo-fi-noggles-everey-where-reorder/4674/7).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1r1Yuk_3.jpg)\n\n# STEP 2: Produce more Lo-Fi paper Noggles \n\nFactory produces what we need to outfit Nounish groups worldwide (we are estimating 25K units). \n\n# STEP 3: Ship worldwide\n\nCases of Lo-Fi Noggles ship to Nounish groups directly from factory.\n\n# STEP 4: Remaining units held in USA for future use\n\nThe rest of the production run (if there are any extras) will be shipped to our warehouse in USA to be allocated and distributed as needed.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SySXKByr2.jpg)\n\n# Why do it this way? \n\nThis plan avoids chaos and increases production and logistical efficiency. (End result: better and more accurately planned proliferation of Nouns on a global scale).\n\n# This round of production:\nThese are the high quality cardboard versions of our classic Noggles design, but created in a flat packed / inexpensive format. Each pair comes packaged with an informative backer card and is easily shipped and distributed at events worldwide. \n\nThis run will improve with heavier cardstack, a 2-sided full color backer card, and a polybag.\n\nLo-Fi Noggles come packed in 50-piece bundles and can be produced and shipped in very large quantities to Nounify even the biggest events. \n\n\n# Why 25K units?\n\nWe feel that 25K pieces is a small ask based on the popularity and the huge need for affordable and easily shipped Noggles around the world. \n\nWe will survey Nouns community members to find out what quantities each of them may require for their upcoming activations.\n\nFinal quantity depends on requests from active Nouns community, event planners and creators.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJXUFuJOn.jpg)\n\n\n# Who is slated to receive Lo-Fi Noggles?\nBelow is a list of some of the active communities that we are considering. They are scattered around the world and host / organize frequent IRL events: \n\n* [Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports): 3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [NOUNS RUNNING](https://twitter.com/NounsRC):  3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [Nouns Amigos](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos):   3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [NOUNS Africa](https://twitter.com/nounsDAOAfrica)\n* [GNARS](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao): 3000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [Alps Dao](https://twitter.com/AlpsDAO) \n* [NOUNS WHISKEY](https://twitter.com/Nouns_Whisky): 3000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [Profwerder](https://twitter.com/ProfWerder): 1000 pcs for ongoing local events\n* [NOUNS Brazil](https://twitter.com/nounsbr)\n* [Nouns Latin America](https://twitter.com/NounsLatam)\n* [NOUNS OTG](https://twitter.com/OTGWTF)\n* [PIZZA DAO](https://twitter.com/Pizza_DAO): 3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events\n* [Australian Open](https://twitter.com/AustralianOpen)\n* [NFT Paris](https://twitter.com/nft_paris)\n* [Nouns Deli](https://twitter.com/NounsDeli): 3000-5000 pcs for ongoing local and global events (USA to Australia shipping is very expensive so this one is great for the team)\n* Free Glasses For Kids / Vision Van\n* **If anyone else has a need for 1000+ pairs of Noggles for an activation, please DM us.**\n\n\n# Improved unit cost:\n$1.95 + shipping, minimum 25K units to achieve this pricing, no maximum order size. [Previous order](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/low-fi-nounish-noggles-by-bigshot/2103/59) costed $2.40/unit.\n\nWorldwide shipping costs average to $350 per carton of 1000, and we'd make minimum of 25 cartons. \n\n# Total ask for 25K units:\n$57,000 in USDC deposited into the Nounworks projects wallet:\n\n\n[0xd25912007EBC2527d4ED9DC536f928E550b0f02C](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd25912007EBC2527d4ED9DC536f928E550b0f02C)\n\n# Why now?\nTo ensure we can distribute the Noggles worldwide ASAP, we aim to place our order with the printer as soon as possible.\n\n\n# After we ship to Nouns community members: \n\nWarehousing, administrative, and shipping fees TBD after the remainder gets to the USA, handled on a case by case basis. (See next prop which deals with ongoing funding for distribution of Nouns merch to members of the community).\n\nIn general once the unclaimed units get back to our USA warehouse, the cost to turn around and ship them again will be $2 per unit for the Lo-Fi Noggles and $2 more to ship them. They are in packs of 50 so that would be $200 shipped to get a pack of 50 back out to another country. That cost will be covered by the recipients or their props.\n\n# Info about our previous order:\n10K units were paid for by Nouns DAO (NSFW) and an additional 3K units were paid for by Bigshot. All have since been dispersed globally, sold out and gone. All faces wearing Lo-Fi Noggles were happy faces!\n\n# So what's next?\n\nGlad you asked. [We will have a follow-up prop that will fund our ongoing supply of our Nounish merch to members of the Nouns community worldwide](https://hackmd.io/@bigshot/BJSZdHJBh    ). This will complete the proliferation machine and will ensure a constant stream of Nounish merch to the doors of the right organizations. Let's go!\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJkXY_Jdh.jpg)",

      "content": "# NounsTennisFam (Feature Nouns/Noggles in grand slams/major tennis events and fund upcoming athletes)\n\n# Objective and Overview\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/W4qgnt8s/2.png)\n\n**NounsTennisFam (NTF)** is a Web3 sports platform co-founded by ATP Rank 15 tennis player, Borna ƒÜoriƒá, and led by CEO Bruno Pliso. Forbes has recognized the platform for its innovative approach to revolutionizing the tennis industry. NTF is now ready to take the next steps in fostering the development of elite tennis talent, enhancing fan engagement, and positioning NounsDAO in front of a global audience of hundreds of millions.\n\nTo achieve these goals, NTF will harness its tennis stars as brand ambassador powerhouses. They will compete in custom NTF Noggles apparel at some of the world's biggest sporting events and actively promote NounsTennisFam through their impressive social media reach. Additionally, NTF will provide a fairer and more transparent on-chain infrastructure for developing elite tennis talent and democratizing the sport.\n\nBy supporting emerging players and enhancing fan engagement, NTF will make a mark on the industry, paving the way for a sustainable ecosystem for talent development, sponsorship opportunities, and interactive experiences. This will leave a legacy and transform NounsTennisFam into a well-known and respected name in the industry.\n\nIn line with NounsDAO's mission of decentralization and community-driven initiatives, NTF will offer a comprehensive suite of resources for professional and aspiring tennis players, including funding, training, and community support. Empowering pros, prospects, and fans and transforming them into a community of benefactors invested in one another's success is the future of sports. Together, let's change the game and establish NounsTennisFam as a major force in professional tennis.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nNounsTennisFam is set to revolutionize the tennis industry through blockchain technology and democratization of the sport by providing fair compensation for investors and talent. With the goal of becoming a cornerstone of the global tennis market valued at $5.6 billion, NounsTennisFam aims to represent athletes and connect fans under the NounsDAO banner in front of millions of fans worldwide.\n\n## Key Objectives\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/3Jn3LBfZ/3.png)\n- Noggles and NounsTennisFam (NTF) branded jerseys to be worn by co-founder Borna Coric (World No 20 Croatian tennis star) in grand slams and other major events, with millions of views and discussions about Nouns and NTF in pre/post-match press conferences.\n- Develop the \"NounsTennisFam\" platform to support up-and-coming athletes by funding them through the issuance of their own digital collectibles, which translates to a portion of the athletes' future game/endorsement earnings.\n- Gain support from athletes such as Real Madrid/Croatian football star Luka Modric, Grand Slam winner Marin Cilic, and others in Borna's network.\n- Provide branded NTF/Noggles competition apparel for all NTF-sponsored athletes, seen by millions.\n- Support underprivileged communities to ensure that economics do not stand in the way of talent.\n- Create new opportunities for fans to interact with sports, invest, and be a part of an athlete's journey from the beginning while learning about web 3 in the process.\n- Establish NounsTennis Fam as a household name in professional sports.\n\nThis collaboration presents a tremendous opportunity for NounsDAO to gain incredible exposure before a global audience and create lasting value for the brand while supporting emerging prospects and established professionals in the tennis industry.\n\n# Opportunity of a Lifetime\n\n## Tennis Viewership Numbers Reveal the Sport's Widespread Appeal and Growing Popularity\n\nMajor tournaments, all of which NTF Co-founder, Borna competes in, attract millions of viewers worldwide. In 2021, Wimbledon reached a global audience of over 500 million viewers, while the French Open and the Australian Open had 350 million and 900 million viewers, respectively (source: Grand Slam Board). This global audience provides a significant opportunity for NounsTennisFam to engage a passionate user base and secure NounsDAO significant exposure before an army of loyal fans.\n\n## Sports on the Blockchain\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, Inc., the global sports market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% from 2020 to 2027, driven by increasing participation in sports, the rising popularity of sports leagues, and the growing demand for sports-related merchandise. Although this report does not specifically address tennis, a Nielsen Sports report forecasts tennis viewership to continue growing in the United States, fueled by top players' popularity and the rise of new stars like Coco Gauff. The US Open, in particular, has experienced significant growth, with a 33% increase in average audience per match in 2021 compared to the previous year. This suggests the potential for the sport to continue to grow in popularity and reach new audiences, offering a substantial opportunity for NounsDAO to engage with a large audience eager for innovative solutions like the NounsTennisFam platform.\n\n## Success stories\n\n### Tennis Australia\n\nTennis Australia collaborated with the Australian Open to incorporate blockchain technology and NFTs into the event. The final bounce of winning points was linked to corresponding NFTs known as \"Artballs.\" Fans owning these NFTs won various rewards, such as tickets to the next year's tournament. The Australian Open also utilized the metaverse, creating a replica of the Rod Laver Arena in Decentraland and engaging with millions of users in a Roblox experience. These initiatives led to increased viewership and fan engagement, demonstrating the potential of blockchain technology in sports.\n\n### NBA Top Shot\n\nNBA Top Shot is a blockchain-based platform that allows fans to buy, sell, and trade officially licensed NBA collectible highlights (NFTs). Its success factors include a strategic partnership with the NBA, a user-friendly platform, and scarcity-driven value of collectibles.\n\n### Socios.com\n\nSocios.com is a blockchain-based fan engagement platform for sports teams. Its success factors include partnerships with top-tier football clubs, fan token offerings (FTOs), and voting rights for fans on certain club decisions.\n\nThese examples exhibit incredible potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize fan engagement, sports financing, and brand name recognition.\n\n## Key Benefits of Collaboration\n\n### Team and Experience\n\nBoasting Ivy League graduates, professional athletes, proven entrepreneurs, and Web3 experts, the NounsTennisFam team is prepared to catapult NounsDAO into the professional tennis spotlight as a fresh, inventive, and distinguished new brand.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/mZzdHWfk/Screen-Shot-2023-06-07-at-1-04-23-am.png)\n\n| [Co-founder Borna ƒÜoriƒá](https://www.atptour.com/en/players/borna-coric/cg80/overview) | [Co-founder & CCO Bruna ƒÜoriƒá](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruna-%C4%87ori%C4%87-916784b5/) | [Co-founder & CEO Bruno Pliso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-pliso-1a29a6176/) | [Creative Director Nina Turudic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolina-turudic-ab29b4b2/) |\n\n| [Finance & Operations Ivan Turudic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-turudi%C4%87-18657a155/) | [CTO Karlo Brdek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlo-brdek) | [CMO Sven Stanko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sven-stanko-545751ba/) | NFT Advisor, Dapper VP Fran Brajcic | [Web3 Consultant Shan Kumar](http://https://twitter.com/shanicucic96) |\n\n\n# Platform Features and User Experience\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1RNDSMdm/platform.png)\n\nNounsTennisFam platform offers a range of features designed to create a transparent, fair, and sustainable ecosystem to attract and connect tennis pros, new talent, and fans. \n\n1. **Platform & Launchpad:** The platform uses blockchain technology to establish a secure and transparent infrastructure to support emerging tennis talent. The NTF dApp enables fans to sponsor young and underprivileged players through funds generated by launchpad mints and commercial sponsorship deals. \n2. **Player Exclusive Launchpad & Drops**: This feature allows established players and potential professionals to tokenize a portion of their anticipated earnings, providing financial support. The platform offers two types of drops: Professional Drops (seasonal tokens) and Prospect Drops (sponsorship tokens), catering to different stages of a player‚Äôs career. \n3. **The Fam Section**: An exclusive content and social networking dashboard for NTF Asset holders, providing access to exclusive content, networking opportunities, and various benefits determined by the athletes. \n4. **Athletes & Valuation**: The platform features verified ATP and WTA players and up-and-coming prospects, with advisory and selection support from Borna‚Äôs management agency, Kozmos Holding. Drops are valued individually, with tokens representing a fraction of the total fractionalized prize money. Professional player valuations are based on historical performance data and a proprietary model, while prospect valuations involve negotiations and selection for either a Prospect pool or a Player exclusive drop, guided by the expertise of Kozmos Holding.\n\nTogether, NounsTennisFam and NounsDAO can actively support emerging tennis superstars by addressing one of their most significant challenges‚Äìfunding, while providing a framework for established professionals to enter the Web3 space through fractionalized earnings. This approach will strengthen our brand and further democratizes the sport of tennis.

I wanted to create speedy, vote-with-reason-focused governance client for Nouns. 30k+ lines of code later, it is minimally fully featured and well loved. \n\n![love2](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/nouns-vote-with-reason/assets/6678357/24c6f906-ae69-4fc1-b4ce-581908f7d898)\n![love4](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/nouns-vote-with-reason/assets/6678357/9bcecb55-7d4b-486c-9fc6-3afbdfc65d3b)\n![love3](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/nouns-vote-with-reason/assets/6678357/6b94d9bf-9b1f-4779-9d6f-4a503a02c11c)\n![love1](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/nouns-vote-with-reason/assets/6678357/25033f2b-7bf8-4c12-81f3-f8dd3ed1cebe)\n![love5](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/nouns-vote-with-reason/assets/6678357/b277f337-1c80-4a41-8320-909c80578b27)\n\nvoter.wtf has pioneered several unique features \n- Homepage features a timeline of all votes across proposals. \n- Proposal pages feature side by side FOR and AGAINST votes, for easy comparison and context setting.\n- Votes can be \"liked\" via web3 wallet signature.\n- Non delegates, in addition to delegates, can vote on any proposal.\n- At glance view of which props you have voted on and which you still need to. \n- reVoteWithReason: quickly vote with reason by quoting someone else's reason in your vote.\n([Twitter roundup of these features](https://twitter.com/voterdotwtf/status/1670190334712639488?s=20), with images)\n\n[The code](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/nouns-vote-with-reason) is open source and under MIT license. The site currently has no cost overhead: it runs on Vercel free tier and only relies on the Nouns DAO subgraph. \n\n## Motivation\nAside from making the speedy, vote-with-reason-centric client that I myself wanted to use, the meta goal of the project is to help Nouns by\n1. Attempting to encourage vote with reason, so that we can better understand each other's perspectives--developing a sort of \"case law\" for what Nouns *is*--and push Nouns to be the #1 place for thoughtful DAO participants. \n2. Present Nouns DAO as a sort of game that can be played. I call the site a \"Nouns DAO console.\" We don't have exciting prop outcomes to share every week, but we do have proposal drama every week, and that's something! \n\n## Traction\nI am most proud of the feedback I shared above and the mint comments below. I hope we'll see more positive feedback come in the votes. Admittedly, I have been cheap and don't have great site analytics. Here is trailing 30 days from Vercel, however it flatlines when my free-tier usage maxes out üòÖ.\n![vercel](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/nouns-vote-with-reason/assets/6678357/3d2f8a0e-190e-4c13-b9d9-f3f36a99f8ce)\n\nHere are analytics from another service, which I added on the 15th.\n![pirsch](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/nouns-vote-with-reason/assets/6678357/2992c7c8-dc26-488b-a70f-0254b063e8e8)\n\nVote support went live on the 12th and you can also track some usage via the *sent from voter.wtf* you see in the vote reasons.\n![vwr](https://github.com/wilsoncusack/nouns-vote-with-reason/assets/6678357/b30be812-b0c1-41ca-a4e2-706df91dd893)\n\n\n## Ask\nI am asking for 10 ETH retro funding to compensate, recognize, and appreciate the work so far. If funded, I am hopeful that this can serve as a model to some subset of developers who want to work with the DAO: hack on something on your own time and try to get some traction. If it proves useful to the DAO, come and ask for retro funding.  \n\nThanks for reading :) VwR! \n\nP.S. \nIf you feel compelled, there is also an [OE](https://zora.co/collect/eth:0xdaec0919ca4670e5823753588f3721ad6eaaf3f1) you can mint to support.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 313 - stETH peg protection",
      "content": "# stETH peg protection\n\n## Summary\n\nNounsDAO currently holds over $26M in stETH, which represents more than 50% of the treasury. Currently, the DAO is not hedged against the [risks](https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/5230603-what-are-the-risks-of-staking-with-lido) associated with stETH. The DAO can derisk these holdings by purchasing [stETH depeg protection](https://www.cozy.finance/protection-market/0x3b548fbadc2d926adb7e5a5d44d824a1c7f3614d) on Cozy v2 protocol. \n\nBy doing so, NounsDAO will:\n\n- Hedge against protocol risk for stETH\n- Enable the DAO to execute transactions on L2, starting with Optimism\n\nBoth of these outcomes will help the DAO proliferate Nouns. The former protects the income generating portion of the treasury. The latter establishes a NounsDAO footprint on a lower fee environment chain, increasing accessibility.\n\nAs a starting point, the DAO could protect $1M worth of stETH for roughly 12 ETH. This protection would cost an estimated 1.5% APR, compared to staking yields of 4-6% APR. There‚Äôs also a one-time cost of $4k to audit the contracts required to buy the protection on Optimism.  \n\n## Cozy Protection\n\nHere‚Äôs how Cozy protection works:\n\n1. Buy protection tokens from the stETH depeg market\n2. If stETH depegs below 50%, the market ‚Äútriggers‚Äù enabling protection token holders to claim a payout\n\nSo if something bad happens to stETH causing a 50%+ depeg, the DAO can recoup its losses based on how much protection it holds.\n\nYou can learn more [here](https://www.cozy.finance/) and in the [docs](https://www.notion.so/1272a15348dc481b9de0e29a33b81c04?pvs=21).\n\n## NounsDAO on Optimism\n\nTo buy protection on the Cozy protocol, the DAO needs a way to execute transactions on Optimism. The DAO can use a proxy contract deployed to Optimism, ‚ÄúL1Proxy,‚Äù to execute transactions.\n\nThe DAO on L1 would execute transactions on L1Proxy by sending messages through [Optimism messengers](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/messaging/) from L1. L1Proxy has an `owner` role which would be the DAO address on L1, and has an authed function which checks [xDomainMessageSender](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/messaging/#accessing-msg-sender) == `owner` that can execute arbitrary transactions. \n\nOnce deployed, the DAO would be able to fund the L1Proxy by using a bridge like Hop.\n\nYou can review the verified contracts [here]. \n\n## Trustlessly buying protections\n\nOnce the L1Proxy is deployed, the DAO can now execute transactions on L2 from L1. To buy protection from the Cozy protocol, the DAO can use the [tokenbuyer contract](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer) developed by the Verbs team with a custom pricefeed. The DAO would fund the tokenbuyer with ETH, specify a price (e.g. $2 per $100 of protection, or ~1.5% APR), and a third party can swap protection tokens for ETH at that price. \n\nClick here to review the contracts for the [token buyer](https://github.com/portaldiscovery/cozy-v2-token-buyer) and the [cross-chain proxy](https://github.com/portaldiscovery/optimism-cross-chain-proxy).\n\n## How it works all together\n\n- **Setup:** Deploy L1Proxy and tokenbuyer on Optimism\n- ********************Proposal:******************** Set the purchase price in the tokenbuyer and bridge ETH to the tokenbuyer\n- ********************Followup:******************** Transfer protection tokens from the tokenbuyer to the L1Proxy\n\n![Untitled](https://cozyfinance.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F368d12be-ce44-4b5b-a0e1-5c94020539f3%2FUntitled.png?id=a93f5bc8-605f-4728-8fad-fcf160832739&table=block&spaceId=2f87461d-478a-4b6b-8c56-3d60c2901f5c&width=1440&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n## How this proliferates Nouns\n\nFunding proposals using the treasury is the singular proliferation mechanism for Nouns. Balancing income generation with risk management is essential for the long term viability of this mechanism. Showing that the DAO can earn income on treasury assets and hedge risk strengthens the DAO‚Äôs ability to continue funding proliferation. \n\nCozy can also be used to protect other LSDs like Rocketpool ETH. Managing protocol risk for other LSDs could make it easier for the DAO to diversify. \n\nFurther, the newly established footprint on L2 opens up exciting possibilities to expand Nouns to lower cost chainspace, increasing accessibility to a more mass market audience.\n\nSome potential use cases include:\n\n- Funding a multisig on optimism to distribute microgrants\n- Open edition mints on Zora\n- Streaming payments\n- On-chain prophouse\n\n## Funding\n\nThe following can be accomplished with 13 ETH and 4000 USDC. \n\n- 4000 USDC for a [Veridise](https://veridise.com/) audit\n- 12 ETH would be used to fund the token buyer. This will all get converted into stETH depeg protection tokens.\n\n## Proposal ops\n\nThis proposal requires two on-chain proposals. The first to audit the two contracts. The second to fund the tokenbuyer that will acquire the Cozy protection.\n\n1. (We are here) Transfer 4000 USDC to Veridise for the audit of the contracts\n2. (Follow up) Transfer 12 ETH to the tokenbuyer, which will get converted into Cozy protection\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFor ~15 ETH, the DAO is getting $1M+ of stETH depeg protection and an address on Optimism that the DAO can control directly through governance. Both outcomes empower the DAO to further proliferate Nouns by funding Nounish projects. \n\nIf you have any questions about the proposal, join this [discussion telegram group](https://t.me/+rfuoI8SkzxdhYjRh).\n\n## FAQs\n\n**How much does protection cost?**\n\nProtection is priced by a bonding curve reflecting supply and demand. The current price is ~$1.4 per $100 of protection and at 80% utilization, the price would be $2. \n\nBecause the DAO will be buying through the tokenbuyer contract, it should set a price slightly above market to create a small arbitrage opportunity, incentivizing third parties to swap.\n\n**How long will protection last?**\n\nProtection on Cozy v2 is perpetual. It decays at a 50% per year. So protection for $1M at the start of the year will cover $500K at the end of the year. \n\n**What‚Äôs the APR of the protection?**\n\nThe estimated APR is ~1.5%. \n\nThis value factors in the proceeds of selling back the protection at the end of the year and normalizes for the decay rate. In this example, the DAO could expect to recoup ~$0.9 per $100 of protection initially purchased. And the average protection amount over the course of the year is 75% (the average of 100% and 50%).\n\n**Who will swap protection for ETH in the tokenbuyer?**\n\nBy setting a price in the tokenbuyer that is higher than the current market price on Cozy, the DAO can expect an economically rational third party to take the arbitrage opportunity.",

      "content": "# NFT Yearbook Prop\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyW-BwaVh.jpg)\n\n## TLDR\n\n\nProposal for Funding from NOUNSDAO to Support the NFT Yearbook Project\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is a unique blend of a digital and physical artifact that boasts 420 pages and weighs 6.9 pounds. It is the largest democratically populated chronicling of the NFT space, and with the support of the NOUNSDAO, we aim to spread the word of web3, NOUNS, and cryptoart around the world, claiming our shared narrative and telling the story of web3 through the eyes of those building it.\n\nThe project has chronicled the web3 narrative from the very beginning to 2022, featuring contributions from over 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members through a democratic nomination process. The yearbook is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about the history and future of web3.\n\nWe believe that NOUNSDAO is a perfect fit for supporting the NFT Yearbook project. The DAO is a community of dedicated web3 enthusiasts who are passionate about spreading the word about this new technology. With the DAO's support, we can reach a wider audience and make a greater impact.\n  \n\nIn collaboration with NOUNSDAO, we propose:\na) Adding the NOUNS DAO logo, visuals, and content to all 3000 NFT Yearbooks.\nb) Creating a limited edition NFT Yearbook with a custom NOUNS cover, to be airdropped to all NOUNS holders.\nc) Printing and strategically placing 100 additional custom NOUNSDAO NFT Yearbooks around the world in strategic libraries / museums such as Harvard Business School, which has already collected 2 NFT Yearbooks for its libraries and permanent archives.\n\nThe total cost for this proposal is 88.6815 Œû\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B163wP6Eh.jpg)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project has captured a snapshot of the rapidly evolving web3 landscape. It's a comprehensive 420-page, 6.9lbs coffee table book, and a 3D digital readable. It spotlights over 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members, including many NOUNS fam.\nLink to participants list: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1559260935520411650 \n\nThroughout the past year, we've accumulated over 750 hours of recorded interviews, encapsulating the web3 narrative from the perspectives of those actively shaping it.\n\nA notable aspect of our project is its community-driven nature. The book was co-written and co-curated by the community. Each interviewee nominated other participants for the book, ensuring diversity, equality, and inclusivity.\n\nWe've also introduced a unique feature to increase engagement: blank content spaces as rarity traits. These spaces allow random NFT holders to contribute to the final version of the book, both digital and physical.\n\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJHoroBDn.png)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/826545378)\n\n\n*A 1/1 cover created by 0xDariush*\n\nBeing a 100% bootstrapped and small team, we've strived to ensure that all artists involved in the project can profit from their contributions by creating a 1:1 cover for the book, auctioned on SuperRare, with 100% of the profits returning to the artists.\n\nIn a month and a half, our [1/1 sales](https://superrare.com/series/0x1e3eac91085df57b4aa417b1471349d0bdb19152) have reached 58.150Œû. Moreover, three artists were invited to SuperRare thanks to the NFT Yearbook project. 79 artists participated in the 1/1 covers and our all-time high sale was 10ETH by thr33som3s.\n\nOur main collection of NFT Yearbooks is hosted on OpenSea, and we've sold 1277 units out of the 3000 total, to date.\n\nWe're proud to announce that the NFT Yearbook was already collected by libraries at Harvard University/HBS, and the books will be placed in their permanent archives. This opportunity would place a NOUNS DAO limited edition cover yearbook in two of the most significant academic libraries globally, cementing its cultural significance.\n\nWith this proposal, we aim to increase the reach of the NOUNSDAO with the historically important content of the NFT Yearbook, to an additional 100 locations worldwide (famed libraries, galleries, etc.)= more NOUNS, everywhere!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJcF8D6Nn.jpg)\n\n## Project Details\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is a pioneering project that combines the physical and digital realms of art and literature. This 420-page coffee table book, weighing in at 6.9 lbs, captures the web3 narrative from the perspective of those who are actively building it. It is also available as a 3D digital readable yearbook, enhancing the experience of the readers.\n\nOver 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members, many from NOUNSDAO, are featured in this comprehensive collection. The book is a testament to the vibrancy and diversity of the web3 community, serving as a historical record of the NFT space till 2022.\n\nOur team has spent over 750 hours recording interviews, providing a wealth of insights and experiences. Additionally, each interviewee was given the opportunity to nominate other participants. This democratic approach to curation ensures that the final product is a true reflection of the community's diversity and inclusivity.\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is more than just a static record. It's a participatory project that invites engagement from its readers. A unique feature of the book is the opportunity for all holders to submit content for a blank space, making it a truly community-curated project.\n\n\n![](https://nftyearbook.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Video_23-02-05_12-13-53-2.gif)\n\n**The Team**\nThe book is created and published by Metaverse Publishing, a new bootstrapped web3 company lead by co-founders @CryptoForager81, (Sol Fayerman-Hansen) the ex-head of innovation at the Bank of Montreal and active in blockchain since 2014, and, @CryptoDashi (Dan Stern) who has 10 years of experience in e-Commerce entrepreneurship and DTC experiences creation.\nBoth have been degening since 2017. \nThe third co-founder of Metaverse Publishing is a storied IRL coffee table book publisher with 30-years of experience and 300+ physical coffee table books produced, printed and shipped globally -Global Village Publishing.\n\n**Metaverse Publishing**\nThe NFT Yearbook is our first step, our contribution to this space.\nThis unique web3 + in-house IRL publishing capability positions Metaverse Publishing to create some real dope sh*t, and it all starts with The NFT Yearbook.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyfUUwT4h.jpg)\n\n## Market Validation\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project has already demonstrated its appeal and relevance within the community. In just a short span of time, we've managed to attract a passionate, dedicated community that actively participates in the project's development.\n\nThe project's notability extends beyond our community. The NFT Yearbook has been recognized by prestigious institutions, including Harvard University, which has included the yearbook in its library collection. This validation from such a renowned educational institution emphasizes the yearbook's cultural and academic significance.\n\nThe community's response has been overwhelmingly positive, with active engagement and enthusiasm for the project. NOUNS DAO members have been integral to the project, participating in decisions, suggesting ideas, and contributing content.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rySrovaEn.jpg)\n\n\n## Goals and Milestones\nHere are our specific goals and milestones:\n\n1. **Finalize the book design with NOUNS DAO:** With the funding, we aim to finalize the design of the book, incorporating the NOUNS DAO community's feedback and ensuring the highest quality. The NFT Yearbook is complete outside of NOUNS DAO content.\n   \n2. **Production:** Upon design finalization, we'll move into production. Each NFT Yearbook comes in digital and physical form, each beautifully bound and printed to the highest standards.\n\n3. **Distribution:** Once the yearbooks are printed, we will handle distribution. We aim to distribute the yearbooks to strategic libraries (two libraries at Harvard have already collected the book and will be placed in their permanent archives), institutions, and individuals around the world, thereby spreading the influence and reach of our community's creative output. For any NOUNS that do not wish to receive their physical books to their address (anons), they will have the option of allowing us to place their books wherever they would like them...schools, libraries, hotels, etc.\n\n4. **Community Engagement:** As a key part of our mission, we will continue to engage our community in the development and refinement of the NFT Yearbook project. This includes seeking their input on design, content, and distribution strategies.\n\n5. **Placing 100 Limited Edition NOUNS Cover Yearbooks In Strategic Libraries / Museums :** With the funding of this prop, Metaverse Publishing will print ( and create the NFTs ) of 100 NOUNS cover NFT Yearbooks and place them in Strategic libraries and institutions. We'll start with Harvard Business School which has already collected 2 NFT Yearbooks for its permanent libraries. We'll seek the community's support and recommendations to assist with this important mission. \n\n6. **Future Editions:** Securing this funding will help set the foundation for the production of future editions of the NFT Yearbook, ensuring that this becomes a tradition within our community, celebrating and documenting our achievements each year with NOUNS as a central figure in the future publications.\n\n7. **NOUNS 3D books** The NFT Yearbook will revolutionize NOUNSDAO book projects (past and future) by transforming them into interactive 3D readable books that can be minted, have AR and VR capabilities, can be read in virtual worlds, etc. \n\n8. **Open-source / free tools** We will give all NOUNSDAO community first access to our open-source and free 3D book creation software, which empowers artists and authors to create immersive and interactive books, enabling them to bring their stories to life in a captivating three-dimensional environment.\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByUlBoSv3.png)](https://player.vimeo.com/video/826536881)\n\n\n*The latest sample - the layout displayed is not final*\n\n## The Impact\n‚Üí Spreading the love: NOUNS will enter up to 3,075 new homes + 100 major, strategic public locations, worldwide.\n\n‚Üí NOUNS and the NFT Yearbook go to Harvard Business School + 100 libraries / museums / galleries / schools...forever!\nThe NFTYB was collected by 2 libraries in Harvard Business School and once printed, will be placed in Baker Library and the main Harvard library on campus. Plus, we will reserve 10 additional units to be collected by future libraries/archives.\n\n‚Üí Supporting the largest-ever chronicling of the space, and contributing to this historical project.\n\n‚Üí Supporting an innovative bootstrapped web3 company, seeking to spearhead publishing 3.0 and empower the next gen of creators of web3.\n\n‚Üí Create a new experience for past and future books supported by the DAO. We‚Äôre working on making all Metaverse Publishing books compatible in online galleries, VR and AR platforms, as well as metaverse platforms (for example, OnCyber).\n\n\n## Project Timeline\n\nNFT Yearbook Timeline:\n\nInterviews: Completed prior to the timeline start.\nWriting of the Book: Completed prior to the timeline start.\nPublic Sale: Completed prior to the timeline start.\n\nRemaining Tasks:\n\n**Completion of Community Content (May 2023):**\nMay 1-28, 2023: Gather and review community submissions (including NOUNSDAO).\nMay 16-25, 2023: Samples - Quality control checks and adjustments, if necessary.\nMay 28-31, 2023: Incorporate the community content into the book and prepare the finalized book layout for printing.\n\n**Physical Printing of the Books (June/July 2023):**\nJune 1-30, 2023: Print the NFT Yearbook.\n\n**Shipping (End of July 2023):**\nJuly 3-16, 2023: Prepare for shipping, including packaging and labeling.\nJuly 17, 2023: Open physical claim and begin shipping the NFT Yearbooks to customers.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1hTTPp43.jpg)\n\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n**The total budget for the NFT Yearbook project is 88.6815 ETH**\n\nHere's how it will be allocated:\n\n**Commission for NOUNS Limited Edition Cover:**\nA total of 3 ETH will be allocated for commissioning an artist, voted by NOUNS Prop House to create three different versions of the limited edition cover.\n\n**Production and Delivery of Books:** The rest of the funds, which total 88.6815 ETH, will be allocated to Metaverse Publishing for the production and delivery of the NFT Yearbooks. This allocation includes:\n- Printing and placing an additional 100 NOUNS Cover NFT Yearbooks in strategic locations, worldwide, starting with Harvard Business School.\n- Cost of producing the digital and physical versions of the NFT Yearbook with the limited edition NOUNS DAO cover.\n- Cost of delivery, which includes worldwide shipping and taxes.\n- The claim for the 6.9lbs physical coffee table book.\n\nThe allocation is based on the public mint price of the book (0.1195 ETH per book), multiplied by the total number of books (717 books).\n\nThe funds will be transferred to the Metaverse Publishing multisig Safe wallet.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJjV0w6Nh.jpg)\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project is an innovative initiative to preserve and celebrate the vibrant, diverse, and rapidly evolving web3 community. By incorporating NOUNS DAO into this historical chronicle and funding the placement of 100 books in strategic libraries around the world, we are not only recognizing the significant role of the DAO and its members in shaping the web3 landscape, but we are also furthering our commitment to diversity, equality, inclusivity and building a community driven narrative of the amazing world of web3.\n\nThe proposed budget of 88.6815 ETH will enable the production and delivery of a limited edition NFT Yearbook featuring a unique NOUNS DAO cover, both in digital and physical formats and placing an additional 100 NOUNS NFT Yearbooks in strategi\n\n\n---\n\nTHIS PROP IS LONGER THAN THE MAX LENGTH FOR SNAPSHOT:\n\n Read the rest of the prop at https://nouns.wtf/vote/312",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 311 - Verbs Team Six Month Extension",
      "content": "# Verbs Team Six Month Extension\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n* Recap of the current term, with a primary focus on DAO V3.\n* Retro thoughts, e.g. we should over-communicate our decisions and status.\n* New projects we‚Äôre excited to work on next, including:\n    * **Nouns Governor**: An NFT-first governor contract that includes granular delegation, removes snapshot block confusion, and enables a more secure DAO fork flow.\n    * **Collaborations**: Collaborate with leading crypto teams to create innovative projects, such as L2 voting and private voting mainnet POCs.\n    * **Rank-Choice Proposals**: Allow proposers to offer multiple variations in a single proposal, hitting optimal DAO<>builder agreements faster.\n* Ongoing Projects: Ensure the completion of DAO V3, private voting wrap-up, and a frontend for fork DAOs.\n* Asking for $450K + 18 ETH, the same budget as [our previous 6-month term](https://nouns.wtf/vote/192).\n\nYour support allows us to keep innovating for Nouns DAO. We invite you to read our full proposal for comprehensive details.\n\n## What We've Done During This Term\n\nWe spent most of our time and energy (by far) on the upcoming [**DAO V3**](https://twitter.com/eladmallel/status/1661510219342524417?s=20) upgrade:\n\n1. Designing [Nouns Fork](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/iN0FKOn_oYVBzlJkwPwK2mhzaeL8K2-W80u82F7fHj8).\n2. Merging it into the original V3 scope.\n3. Testing this version and getting it audited by [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/) and [code4rena](https://nouns.wtf/vote/302).\n\nOther projects:\n* Led the [private voting research mandated round](https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint), which we believe so far to be successful in making Nouns interesting to other Ethereum and zk folks; we hope to preserve this momentum in the near future.\n* Shipped [Nouns Streamer](https://twitter.com/davidbrai/status/1625215669582147585).\n* Landed on an Airdrop design through [a Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/nouns.eth/proposal/0xebe4aec5b96dc5c008902da341bcd4936f5aa09baf73daaa545259183b203089).\n* Gave [a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw_GU6Gs81o) at ETH Denver.\n\n\nFor even more context, [see our previous proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/192).\n\n## Retrospective\n\n### On Communication\n\n**TL;DR: We should over-communicate our decisions and our status.**\n\nWorking for the DAO means addressing diverse stakeholders and their varied views, and dealing with new members unfamiliar with past discussions or decisions. While it's impossible to appease everyone, we aim to strike a balance between involving voters and maintaining autonomy to execute tasks efficiently.\n\nIn our current term we revived [our Snapshot account](https://snapshot.org/#/nouns.eth/) and involved the DAO in choosing its favorite \"airdrop\" design, and in confirming our sense that most Nouns wanted the fork to get shipped ASAP. We will continue to use this communication channel whenever we identify a decision important enough to ask for such attention.\n\nDespite our intention to keep the DAO informed, we've heard that some feel out of the loop, and some are concerned about how and why decisions were made.\n\nMoving forward, we'll prioritize frequent communication about our projects, rationale, and key decisions. We'll use varied formats like blog posts and Twitter discussions to update and receive feedback or ideas to optimize our service to the DAO.\n\n### On Organization\n\nDecentralization, or resilience, seems very important to the DAO. Many voters want to ensure Nouns does not have a single point of failure anywhere, so Nouns may live long and prosper forever(ish). And we've heard some concerns saying we could be doing more on this front.\n\nSo we've been wondering: how might we get more talented builders creating software for/with Nouns? How can we have more parallel processing in areas like smart contracts and other infrastructure needs, much like the success we've had with the governance clients and private voting mandated rounds? And how can we design process and tech to become more resilient and unstoppable?\n\nWe don't have a fully worked-out answer to these questions, but we're curious to try different ideas in this vein. Some questions on our minds:\n\n* How might we better incentivize multiple autonomous teams to contribute smart contracts to Nouns?\n* How might we create more collaborations with top crypto teams?\n* What should be the future of nouns.wtf? Sunset or maintained as an important reference client? and if maintained, by whom?\n* What are distributed work practices we can adopt from others like the Ethereum Foundation and its collaboration with the various client teams?\n\nWe believe figuring all this out can be instrumental in positioning Nouns as a leader in the Ethereum space, and one of the most attractive places to join as a Nouner, builder, delegate or fan.\n\n\n## What's Next\n\nWe expect technical work to continue taking up the vast majority of our time and energy; this term we plan to spend more time than before on proliferation of Nouns tech and collaboration with more tech teams.\n\n### Technical\n\nWe're sharing below our current plan, and emphasizing again that it's absolutely subject to change as we learn more doing the work, or if community members share ideas that are worth changing priorities for.\n\n#### Follow-Through\n\nWe hope these items won't take up much time, but making it clear that as long as these items need our attention, they are top priority.\n\n1. **Art storage compatibility break**: in the next Ethereum upgrade [EIP-3540](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3540) should go into effect. This change means our current art contract will not be able to store new art, while it can still read existing art. We will come up with a plan to handle this change.\n2. **DAO V3**: monitor this version on mainnet, be around for questions and any bug fixing that may arise.\n3. **Fork DAOs frontend**: for forks to have UI for governance and auction, a minor modification of the nouns.wtf code.\n4. **Private voting**: help the DAO crystalize learnings from this prop house round, and decide how to proceed.\n\n#### High Priority\n\nThese projects get us really excited. We would start on these as soon as V3 is live and the above musts are in good shape.\n\n1. **Nouns Governor**\n   Nouns DAO was launched as a fork of Compound Governor Bravo, and to this day remains similar in key aspects. Since then a lot has changed, the DAO landscape has evolved, and here specifically at Nouns we're hitting some walls continuing to rely on the original design. It's time to go back to first principles.\n   \n   The foundation of this new governor design is using NFT-based voting. In today's design voters have a numeric votes balance, an inheritance from Compound's ERC20-based DAO. A Nouns design would be NFT-based, where NFTs are the voters rather than wallets. Some of the benefits of NFT-based voting:\n   * No more snapshot block confusion.\n   * Granular delegation, one Noun at a time.\n   * Fork V2 (see below).\n   * Token owners can override their delegate's vote.\n   * and more.\n   \n   Other changes we're considering are too raw to articulate here; they will be part of our preliminary research, and will be communicated to the community as soon as possible.\n2. **Collaborations with other teams**\n   We'd like to work with leading teams in their fields, to help move the needle for Nouns and the DAO ecosystem. Key examples are:\n   * **Private voting**: work with leading zk teams (likely from the first mandated round) towards building experimental private voting governors on mainnet.\n   * **L2 voting**: collaborate with leading teams to experiment with voting on L2.\n   \n   We will explore additional collaboration opportunities as well, including other teams building governance smart contracts.\n\n#### Medium Priority\n\nBig projects:\n\n1. **Fork V2**\n   The full scope of improvements requires further research. We can say we're hoping to mitigate the current flaw where a majority can follow a forking minority into their fork, making the fork DAO yet another bad environment for the forkers; a solution we have in mind involves NFT-based voting, or other technical approaches that were out of scope for this first version.\n2. **Rank-choice proposals**\n   A long-standing favorite of ours we deemed less urgent so far; it can enable builders to offer multiple variations of their project in a single onchain proposal, hitting more optimal DAO<>builder agreements faster.\n   \nSmaller projects:\n\n3. **Tip governance clients**\n   We're super excited about this one! the idea is for the DAO to send ETH to governance clients' wallets the more they generate votes and proposals onchain, to better incentivize them to create the best UX and features for voters and proposers, and have long-term sustainability.\n5. **Undo vote**\n   Like Gmail's undo send shortly after you send an email, only for votes, to help people fix their voting mistakes (yes, they are still happening).\n\n#### Low Priority\n\n1. AuctionHouse V2: mainly introduces a new onchain price history feed. The project is already coded, next we'll need to run more tests and get it audited.\n2. [Airdrops](https://snapshot.org/#/nouns.eth/proposal/0xebe4aec5b96dc5c008902da341bcd4936f5aa09baf73daaa545259183b203089): we would follow the DAO's choice to build a Nouns Buyer contract. \n3. DAO-controlled multisigs: a Gnosis Safe extension such that multisigs created for Nouns proposals will include the DAO as an admin that can execute arbitrary transactions from those Safes.\n4. Streamer frontend: a web client showing all streams created by the DAO, allowing recipients to view and withdraw from their streams, and allowing Nouns voters to propose to cancel any open stream.\n\n\n### Proliferation & Collaboration\n\nWe would like to do more in this area than we've done so far, while still dedicating the vast majority of our time to the technical projects mentioned above.\n\nSome examples on our mind:\n\n* Github repo house cleaning, for forkers and community members to easily use\n* Initiate new collaborations with well-known teams, as mentioned above.\n* Create more compelling content about Nouns tech, e.g. by working with Nounish.\n* Research ways to onboard more autonomous solidity teams, e.g. incentivize and fund teams to create alternative governor contracts.\n\nWe believe a multi-governor future can be exciting, however this vision isn't clear enough yet to elaborate in this proposal. We'd like to continue discussing this vision with other token holders and community members who feel excited about it.\n\n## Compensation & Terms\n\n* 6 month engagement starting August 1, 2023.\n* Payment done via streams controlled by the DAO, cancelable via proposal.\n* $37.5k per person (2) per month (6) paid in USDC.\n* 3 ETH per month to Solimander, for time spent meeting with the team, reviewing designs and code, and supporting audits and rollout.\n* Total: 450,000 USDC, 18 ETH.\n* Additional funding for things like audits, mandated rounds and other experiments will be requested separately as needs arise.\n\n---\n\nFor any questions, we're available on the NCD discord server and on twitter.\n\n\n[david](https://twitter.com/davidbrai) & [elad](https://twitter.com/eladmallel)\nverbs team ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 309 - NFT Yearbook Prop WORKING DRAFT",
      "content": "# NFT Yearbook Prop WORKING DRAFT\n\n\nUglyDAO is submitting on behalf on the NFT Yearbook team but is not a part of the team. Please direct all questions to the NFT Yearbook team.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyW-BwaVh.jpg)\n\n## TLDR\n\n\nProposal for Funding from NOUNSDAO to Support the NFT Yearbook Project\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is a unique blend of a digital and physical artifact that boasts 420 pages and weighs 6.9 pounds. It is the largest democratically populated chronicling of the NFT space, and with the support of the NOUNSDAO, we aim to spread the word of web3, NOUNS, and cryptoart around the world, claiming our shared narrative and telling the story of web3 through the eyes of those building it.\n\nThe project has chronicled the web3 narrative from the very beginning to 2022, featuring contributions from over 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members through a democratic nomination process. The yearbook is a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning more about the history and future of web3.\n\nWe believe that NOUNSDAO is a perfect fit for supporting the NFT Yearbook project. The DAO is a community of dedicated web3 enthusiasts who are passionate about spreading the word about this new technology. With the DAO's support, we can reach a wider audience and make a greater impact.\n  \n\nIn collaboration with NOUNSDAO, we propose:\na) Adding the NOUNS DAO logo, visuals, and content to all 3000 NFT Yearbooks.\nb) Creating a limited edition NFT Yearbook with a custom NOUNS cover, to be airdropped to all NOUNS holders.\nc) Printing and strategically placing 100 additional custom NOUNSDAO NFT Yearbooks around the world in stratigic libraries / museums such as Harvard Business School, which has already collected 2 NFT Yearbooks for their libraries and permanent archives.\n\nThe total cost for this proposal is 88.6815 Œû\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B163wP6Eh.jpg)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project has captured a snapshot of the rapidly evolving web3 landscape. It's a comprehensive 420-page, 6.9lbs coffee table book, and a 3D digital readable. It spotlights over 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members, including many NOUNS fam.\nLink to participants list: https://twitter.com/i/lists/1559260935520411650 \n\nThroughout the past year, we've accumulated over 750 hours of recorded interviews, encapsulating the web3 narrative from the perspectives of those who are actively shaping it.\n\nA notable aspect of our project is its community-driven nature. The book was co-written and co-curated by the community. Each interviewee nominated other participants for the book, ensuring diversity, equality, and inclusivity.\n\nWe've also introduced a unique feature to increase engagement: blank content spaces as rarity traits. These spaces allow random NFT holders to contribute to the final version of the book, both digital and physical. See the 1/1 cover created by 0xDariush here: https://player.vimeo.com/video/826545378\n\nBeing a 100% bootstrapped and small team, we've strived to ensure that all artists involved in the project can profit from their contributions by creating a 1:1 cover for the book, auctioned on SuperRare, with 100% of the profits returning to the artists.\n\nIn a month and a half, our [1/1 sales](https://superrare.com/series/0x1e3eac91085df57b4aa417b1471349d0bdb19152) have reached 58.150Œû. Moreover, three artists were invited to SuperRare thanks to the NFT Yearbook project. 79 artists took part in the 1/1 covers and our all-time high sale was 10ETH by thr33som3s.\n\nOur main collection of NFT Yearbooks is hosted on OpenSea, and we've sold 1277 units out of the 3000 total, to date.\n\nWe're proud to announce that the NFT Yearbook was already collected by libraries at Harvard University/HBS, and the books will be placed in their permanent archives. This opportunity would place a NOUNS DAO limited edition cover yearbook in two of the most significant academic libraries globally, cementing its cultural significance.\n\nWith this proposal we aim to increase the reach of the NOUNSDAO with the historically important content of the NFT Yearbook, to an additional 100 locations worldwide (famed libraries, galleries, etc.)= more NOUNS, everywhere!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJcF8D6Nn.jpg)\n\n## Project Details\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is a pioneering project that combines the physical and digital realms of art and literature. This 420-page coffee table book, weighing in at 6.9 lbs, captures the web3 narrative from the perspective of those who are actively building it. It is also available as a 3D digital readable yearbook, enhancing the experience of the readers.\n\nOver 550 artists, collectors, founders, creators, and community members, many from NOUNSDAO, are featured in this comprehensive collection. The book is a testament to the vibrancy and diversity of the web3 community, serving as a historical record of the NFT space till 2022.\n\nOur team has spent over 750 hours recording interviews, providing a wealth of insights and experiences. Additionally, each interviewee was given the opportunity to nominate other participants. This democratic approach to curation ensures that the final product is a true reflection of the community's diversity and inclusivity.\n\nThe NFT Yearbook is more than just a static record. It's a participatory project that invites engagement from its readers. A unique feature of the book is the opportunity for all holders to submit content for a blank space, making it a truly community-curated project.\n\n\n**The Team**\nThe book is created and published by Metaverse Publishing, a new bootstraped web3 company lead by co-founders @CryptoForager81, (Sol Fayerman-Hansen) the ex head of innovation at the Bank of Montreal and active in blockchain since 2014, and, @CryptoDashi (Dan Stern) who has 10 years of experience in e-Commerce entrepreneurship and DTC experiences creation.\nBoth have been degening since 2017. \nThe third co-founder of Metaverse publishing is a storied IRL coffee table book publisher with 30-years of experience and 300+ physical coffee table books produced, printed and shipped globally -Global Village Publishing.\n\n**Metaverse Publishing**\nThe NFT Yearbook is our first step, our contribution to this space.\nThis unique web3 + in-house IRL publishing capability positions Metaverse Publishing to create some real dope sh*t, and it all starts with The NFT Yearbook.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyfUUwT4h.jpg)\n\n## Market Validation\n\nThe NFT Yearbook project has already demonstrated its appeal and relevance within the community. In just a short span of time, we've managed to attract a passionate, dedicated community that actively participates in the project's development.\n\nThe project's notability extends beyond our community. The NFT Yearbook has been recognized by prestigious institutions, including Harvard University, which has included the yearbook in its library collection. This validation from such a renowned educational institution emphasizes the yearbook's cultural and academic significance.\n\nThe community's response has been overwhelmingly positive, with active engagement and enthusiasm for the project. NOUNS DAO members have been integral to the project, participating in decisions, suggesting ideas, and contributing content.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rySrovaEn.jpg)\n\n\n## Goals and Milestones\nHere are our specific goals and milestones:\n\n1. **Finalize the book design with NOUNS DAO:** With the funding, we aim to finalize the design of the book, incorporating the NOUNS DAO community's feedback and ensuring the highest quality. The NFT Yearbook is complete outside of NOUNS DAO content.\n   \n2. **Production:** Upon design finalization, we'll move into production. Each NFT Yearbook comes in digital and physical form, each beautifully bound and printed to the highest standards.\n\n3. **Distribution:** Once the yearbooks are printed, we will handle distribution. We aim to distribute the yearbooks to strategic libraries (two libraries at Harvard have already collected the book and will will be placed in their permanent archives), institutions, and individuals around the world, thereby spreading the influence and reach of our community's creative output. For any NOUNS that do not wish to receive their physical books to their address (anons), they will have the option of allowing us to place their books wherever they would like them...schools, libraries, hotels, etc.\n\n4. **Community Engagement:** As a key part of our mission, we will continue to engage our community in the development and refinement of the NFT Yearbook project.

The first event, held in 2022, was financed by the 5ETH Small Grant from Nouns DAO. Primarily successful in Japan, we're planning to host the second event in 2023. This year, we aim to expand globally and attract more participants than before. The main objectives of the festival include:\n\n- Spreading awareness about the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth\n- Materializing the \"Public Good\" concept, which is integral to Nouns' principles\n- Broadening Nouns' recognition to a wider audience\n\nIn this proposal, we request a budget of 47.1ETH to accomplish these goals. The details follow.\n\n## Table of Contents ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n- Introduction\n- Our Commitment to This Film Festival\n- Preparations for the 2023 Festival\n  - Establishing New Submission Categories\n  - Intensifying Call for Entries\n  - Implementing a Participatory Voting System\n  - Enhancing Screenings and Award Ceremonies\n- Schedule\n- Budget\n- NounsFes Originators\n- Appendix: Achievements from 2022\n\n## Introduction ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\nNounsFes is an online art festival, conceived by the members of NounsDAO, aiming to educate as many people as possible about the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth. Our theme, \"The Importance of a Peaceful and Sustainable Earth,\" embodies the principle of \"Public Good,\" which Nouns values greatly. This year, we aim to invite diverse submissions and offer more people an opportunity to understand the ideals behind Nouns and NounsFes.\n\n## Our Commitment to This Film Festival ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\nWhile film festivals like the Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Awards are renowned, they're bound by traditional business models, prompting us to perceive a need for a new type of film festival. Information transmission methods vary from text, text and images, sound, sound and images, to video. It is clear that video is the most efficient way to communicate information. We believe that there is a huge future potential in short videos viewed through small smartphone screens, given the inconvenience of VR/AR glasses, despite emerging concepts like \"virtual space\" or \"metaverse.\"\n\n## Preparations for the 2023 Festival ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\nThe first event in 2022 allowed us to introduce the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth within Japan via NounsFes. However, we have not yet managed to relay this concept to many who are unaware of Nouns. Hence, this year, we aim to familiarize more people with NounsFes and further disseminate the importance of a peaceful and sustainable Earth, and the principle of \"Public Good\" that Nouns values.\n\nNounsFes Updates:\n- Establishing new submission categories\n- Intensifying call for entries\n- Implementing a participatory voting system\n- Enhancing screenings and award ceremonies\n\n### 1. Introduction of New Categories\nThis year, we aim to encourage more people to submit more works by introducing new categories such as Short Video, Vertical Short Video, and Super Short Video. The added categories are designed to be easily accessible to anyone using their smartphones.\n\n- **Short Video Category**\n    The aim is to create 2-3 minute works that evoke emotions and contribute to a better future. The themes are love, peace, or sustainable earth (SDGs).\n    Example work: [Theme SDGs](https://youtu.be/bQoJqDi8490)\n[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/bQoJqDi8490/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQoJqDi8490)\n    \n\n- **Vertical Short Video Category**\n    With the same aim and themes as the Short Video Category, this category calls for works that fully utilize the verticality of smartphone-recorded daily life.\n[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/77mNcy0D-NU/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77mNcy0D-NU)\n\n- **Super Short Video Category**\n    This category calls for works under 60 seconds with the same aim and themes as above, focusing on capturing the viewer's heart in a short time.\n[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6sSjPzsFvPA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sSjPzsFvPA)\n\n### 2. Strengthening the Collection of Works\nLast year, we received around 50 submissions. We are strengthening our efforts to attract more entries. The specific measures are as follows:\n1. Introduce new categories (Vertical Short Video and Super Short Video) to make it easier for more people to submit their works.\n2. Simplify the application process to ease the burden on applicants.\n3. Experiment with various new promotional activities.\n* Visit schools and directly approach students aspiring to be creators to encourage them to apply.\n* Conduct daily recruitment of submissions through official social media channels.\n* Renew the website and regularly update its content to attract more participants.\n* Run online commercials to generate interest and encourage applications from a wider audience.\n* Actively participate in various events and distribute leaflets to increase awareness.\n* Organize a press super-short video contest online to enhance visibility.\n* Collaborate with web3 influencers to become ambassadors and promote the event.\n* Implement various giveaway campaigns to generate interest and encourage participation.\n* Create mechanisms to provide real-time updates on application status and continue information dissemination.\n* Maintain ongoing communication and information dissemination to NounsDao and various Nouns sub-DAO members worldwide.\n* Utilize audio media and Twitter Spaces to regularly promote events and showcase submitted works. Specifically, collaborate with The NounSquare, a space hosted by pNouns every Friday, to disseminate information globally.\n\nThrough these publicity activities, ensure that the objectives of NounsFes are well-known and create an environment where many people submit their works.\n\n### 3. Establishing an All-Participation Voting System\nSubmitted works will be published on social media platforms (Youtube, TikTok) for review by participants with voting rights.\n\nLast year, we conducted voting using NFTs called \"Named Noun\" and \"Nouns Love\" from the collection as voting rights. This year, we will continue using these two NFTs as voting rights and further grant voting rights to NFT holders related to Nouns. This update aims to create a more accessible system for a larger number of people to participate in the voting process.\n\n### 4. Enrichment of Screening and Award Ceremonies\nThe award ceremony for outstanding works will be held after the screening. As before, we will host real events by renting a movie theater and invite the creators of the nominated works to walk the red carpet.\n\nFurthermore, at the venue, we will distribute/sell Nouns-related merchandise and conduct workshops to promote the various aspects of Nouns and enhance the excitement of the event. Many members of the Nouns proposal 228: NogglesJackTokyo are part of the project team this time. The event held on May 20-21, 2023, was a great success.\n\nHere are some examples of Nouns-related merchandise that were sold at that time.\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1030992113799798801/1117063446618456064/goods.jpg)\n\n\nThis is the movie of that time.\n{%youtube H2i0gGUXCnA %}\n\n\nThis time, we are accepting submissions from around the world. Attendance at the screening will be from various locations worldwide.\nFor those who cannot attend the venue on the day of the event, we aim to provide a virtual screening venue in metaverses or other virtual spaces, enabling a larger number of participants to join the screening.\n\n![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1030992113799798801/1117063447000121344/MetaVerse.jpg)\n\n## Schedule ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® \n- Announcement : 2023/7/1 \n- Submission Period : 2023/7/10 - 11/30\n- Nominee Announcement : 2023/12/10 \n- Final Result Announcement (Screening) : 2023/12/21 (tentative) \n\n## Budget ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n### Project Expense Breakdown\n- Planning, Operation, Accounting : 3.8 ETH\n- Website Development : 7.5 ETH\n- Content Management : 4.2 ETH\n- PR Activities : 4.5 ETH\n- Event Expenses : 3.8 ETH\n150,000 yen (theater), Travel and transportation expenses 300,000 yen (awardees), 500,000 yen (others)\n- Gift Expenses : 1.3 ETH\n\n### Prize Money\n- *Total: 22.0 ETH*\n  - Short category: Best: 3 ETH x 1, Excellence: 2 ETH x 2, Honorable mention: 1 ETH x 3\n  - Vertical Short category: 0.5 ETH x 10 \n  - Super Short category: 0.5 ETH x 10\n  - PR Pre-contest: 0.1 ETH x 20\n\n### Total Budget: 47.1 ETH\n(Note: The requested amount for this proposal)\n\n## Organizer\n[**Satoshi Nakajima**](https://twitter.com/nounsfes) - Software architect of Windows95 and Founder of Xevo Inc.(Noun245 Owner)\n\n### Supported by:\n\n[**Singularity Society**](https://www.singularitysociety.org/) - An organization created to provide entrepreneurs who have the potential to shoulder the next era of Japan and the world with opportunities for study, discussion, information dissemination, networking, and entrepreneurship, and to support them in various ways.\n\n[**NounsDAO JAPAN**](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOJAPAN) - Japanese biggest community of Nouns.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 306 - SNP - SD Comic Con: Connecting a Cornucopia of Creators",
      "content": "# SNP - SD Comic Con: Connecting a Cornucopia of Creators\n\n**TLDR:**\nNouns Town crew will head to SD Comic Con to gift 2,500 Nouns Activity Books to artists and collectors and commission 100+ Nounish artworks from industry pros + proliferate the meme through friends and peer collaborations.\nTotal cots $57,500.00\n\n## SD Comic Con: Connecting a Cornucopia of Creators\nSan Diego Comicon happens in July of 2023, and is a gathering of fans of pop culture, along with the artists that create content for them. With six figures of people walking through the doors, it has become one of the largest gatherings for talented people in the world. Those that write and draw comics, books, web series, movies and television, everyone goes to connect to the fans that keep them employed and appreciate them.\n\nBringing in outside artists to Nouns would be a huge boon to the ecosystem. It would bring different creative perspectives to an artistic project, but also bring in a fan base that currently has no real visibility to Nouns. If we engage creators, get them excited, we have already seen that they will then plug themselves into Nouns, engage with Nouns, while still engaging with the medium they are experts in.\n\nNouns is in a unique position to make dreams come true for creators that would otherwise be dissatisfied with their lot in their industry. If Eastman and Laird (the creators of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) had access to Nouns, not only would they have brought Nouns iconography to their books, but they would have had an outlet to seek funding, letting Nouns fund the Turtles, which would later become a licensing juggernaut. This is a perfect end use case for Nouns collabs with creators.\n\nOur first step is to go to San Diego, connect with as many creatives as we can. We will get them to do commissioned work (which we will pay for) in a special Nouns sketch book, of which we will print many copies. This will let us open a dialogue with them to discuss Nouns, cc0, the benefits of the ecosystem, and how they might benefit from introducing themselves here.\n\nWe will aim for over 100 creators‚Äô commissions, giving Nouns many different versions and interpretations of Nouns and Nounish things from established artists, introduce the artists to us and cc0, and finally create inroads for further exploration in the near future. We will spread our net wide, but go for the premier artists in the industry (Jim Lee, Todd McFarlane, Geoff Darrow, etc.) along with the more traditional artists. Having been in this industry for two dozen years, I am comfortable saying I can have a conversation with any level of talent.\n\n**Nouns Sketch Book:** We will print 2,500 copies of a Nouns sketch book, with pages from the Nouns comic book contained within, as well as colouring pages, how to draw Nouns, and blank pages. We will give these away to creators, encouraging them to fill up the blank pages and give them back at the end.\n\n**Commission payments:** This is the main source of income for creators at conventions, so we will be paying for each commissioned work. We will specify that we wish something to do with Nouns (and the pages containing Nouns will give them plenty of reference material). The rate paid will be dependent upon the work they are doing, along with what their standard rate is. As a rough estimate, we will aim to pay $300 USD for a full sketch of a Noun in the creators‚Äô style.\n\nWe will need to have the books printed and delivered to San Diego no later than July 17th of 2023. This means we wish to be at the printer by the last week of June, which is our goal. Having decades of experience making monthly comic books, I am comfortable saying this will be 100% achievable. We have the designers, printers, shipper and storage lined up. It was essential to plot out the viability of accomplishing this prior to suggesting it.\n\nWho: Nouns Town team of Danny Schlitz, Adam & Bennet + Joshua Fisher\n\n**How Much:**\n$15,000 USD - Creating, Printing and Shipping 2,500 Nouns Sketch Books\n$30,000 USD - Commission Payments for 100+ Commissions\n$12,5000 USD - Adam, Josh, Danny & Bennet will be there manage the facilitation of the books and creators, as well as scanning the art pieces for the DAO afterwards. This covers travel and per diem costs.\n\n**$57,500 USD** - Total ask sent to ComicsDAO/SharkDAO Multisig\n\nProp by: @defaulteduser / Adam + Joshua Fisher",

      "content": "# NounsTennisFam (Feature Nouns/Noggles in grand slams/major tennis events and fund upcoming athletes)\n\n# Objective and Overview\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/W4qgnt8s/2.png)\n\n**NounsTennisFam (NTF)** is a Web3 sports platform co-founded by ATP Rank 20, Borna ƒÜoriƒá, and led by CEO Bruno Pliso. Forbes has recognized the platform for its innovative approach to revolutionizing the tennis industry. NTF is now ready to take the next steps in fostering the development of elite tennis talent, enhancing fan engagement, and positioning NounsDAO in front of a global audience of hundreds of millions.\n\nTo achieve these goals, NTF will harness its tennis stars as brand ambassador powerhouses. They will compete in custom NTF Noggles apparel at some of the world's biggest sporting events and actively promote NounsTennisFam through their impressive social media reach. Additionally, NTF will provide a fairer and more transparent on-chain infrastructure for developing elite tennis talent and democratizing the sport.\n\nBy supporting emerging players and enhancing fan engagement, NTF will make a mark on the industry, paving the way for a sustainable ecosystem for talent development, sponsorship opportunities, and interactive experiences. This will leave a legacy and transform NounsTennisFam into a well-known and respected name in the industry.\n\nIn line with NounsDAO's mission of decentralization and community-driven initiatives, NTF will offer a comprehensive suite of resources for professional and aspiring tennis players, including funding, training, and community support. Empowering pros, prospects, and fans and transforming them into a community of benefactors invested in one another's success is the future of sports. Together, let's change the game and establish NounsTennisFam as a major force in professional tennis.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nNounsTennisFam is set to revolutionize the tennis industry through blockchain technology and democratization of the sport by providing fair compensation for investors and talent. With the goal of becoming a cornerstone of the global tennis market valued at $5.6 billion, NounsTennisFam aims to represent athletes and connect fans under the NounsDAO banner in front of millions of fans worldwide.\n\n## Key Objectives\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/3Jn3LBfZ/3.png)\n- Noggles and NounsTennisFam (NTF) branded jerseys to be worn by co-founder Borna Coric (World No 20 Croatian tennis star) in grand slams and other major events, with millions of views and discussions about Nouns and NTF in pre/post-match press conferences.\n- Develop the \"NounsTennisFam\" platform to support up-and-coming athletes by funding them through the issuance of their own digital collectibles, which translates to a portion of the athletes' future game/endorsement earnings.\n- Gain support from athletes such as Real Madrid/Croatian football star Luka Modric, Grand Slam winner Marin Cilic, and others in Borna's network.\n- Provide branded NTF/Noggles competition apparel for all NTF-sponsored athletes, seen by millions.\n- Support underprivileged communities to ensure that economics do not stand in the way of talent.\n- Create new opportunities for fans to interact with sports, invest, and be a part of an athlete's journey from the beginning while learning about web 3 in the process.\n- Establish NounsTennis Fam as a household name in professional sports.\n\nThis collaboration presents a tremendous opportunity for NounsDAO to gain incredible exposure before a global audience and create lasting value for the brand while supporting emerging prospects and established professionals in the tennis industry.\n\n# Opportunity of a Lifetime\n\n## Tennis Viewership Numbers Reveal the Sport's Widespread Appeal and Growing Popularity\n\nMajor tournaments, all of which NTF Co-founder, Borna competes in, attract millions of viewers worldwide. In 2021, Wimbledon reached a global audience of over 500 million viewers, while the French Open and the Australian Open had 350 million and 900 million viewers, respectively (source: Grand Slam Board). This global audience provides a significant opportunity for NounsTennisFam to engage a passionate user base and secure NounsDAO significant exposure before an army of loyal fans.\n\n## Sports on the Blockchain\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, Inc., the global sports market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.3% from 2020 to 2027, driven by increasing participation in sports, the rising popularity of sports leagues, and the growing demand for sports-related merchandise. Although this report does not specifically address tennis, a Nielsen Sports report forecasts tennis viewership to continue growing in the United States, fueled by top players' popularity and the rise of new stars like Coco Gauff. The US Open, in particular, has experienced significant growth, with a 33% increase in average audience per match in 2021 compared to the previous year. This suggests the potential for the sport to continue to grow in popularity and reach new audiences, offering a substantial opportunity for NounsDAO to engage with a large audience eager for innovative solutions like the NounsTennisFam platform.\n\n## Success stories\n\n### Tennis Australia\n\nTennis Australia collaborated with the Australian Open to incorporate blockchain technology and NFTs into the event. The final bounce of winning points was linked to corresponding NFTs known as \"Artballs.\" Fans owning these NFTs won various rewards, such as tickets to the next year's tournament. The Australian Open also utilized the metaverse, creating a replica of the Rod Laver Arena in Decentraland and engaging with millions of users in a Roblox experience. These initiatives led to increased viewership and fan engagement, demonstrating the potential of blockchain technology in sports.\n\n### NBA Top Shot\n\nNBA Top Shot is a blockchain-based platform that allows fans to buy, sell, and trade officially licensed NBA collectible highlights (NFTs). Its success factors include a strategic partnership with the NBA, a user-friendly platform, and scarcity-driven value of collectibles.\n\n### Socios.com\n\nSocios.com is a blockchain-based fan engagement platform for sports teams. Its success factors include partnerships with top-tier football clubs, fan token offerings (FTOs), and voting rights for fans on certain club decisions.\n\nThese examples exhibit incredible potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize fan engagement, sports financing, and brand name recognition.\n\n## Key Benefits of Collaboration\n\n### Team and Experience\n\nBoasting Ivy League graduates, professional athletes, proven entrepreneurs, and Web3 experts, the NounsTennisFam team is prepared to catapult NounsDAO into the professional tennis spotlight as a fresh, inventive, and distinguished new brand.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/mZzdHWfk/Screen-Shot-2023-06-07-at-1-04-23-am.png)\n\n| [Co-founder Borna ƒÜoriƒá](https://www.atptour.com/en/players/borna-coric/cg80/overview) | [Co-founder & CCO Bruna ƒÜoriƒá](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruna-%C4%87ori%C4%87-916784b5/) | [Co-founder & CEO Bruno Pliso](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bruno-pliso-1a29a6176/) | [Creative Director Nina Turudic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolina-turudic-ab29b4b2/) |\n\n| [Finance & Operations Ivan Turudic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-turudi%C4%87-18657a155/) | [CTO Karlo Brdek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karlo-brdek) | [CMO Sven Stanko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sven-stanko-545751ba/) | NFT Advisor, Dapper VP Fran Brajcic | [Web3 Consultant Shan Kumar](http://https://twitter.com/shanicucic96) |\n\n\n# Platform Features and User Experience\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/1RNDSMdm/platform.png)\n\nNounsTennisFam platform offers a range of features designed to create a transparent, fair, and sustainable ecosystem to attract and connect tennis pros, new talent, and fans. \n\n1. **Platform & Launchpad:** The platform uses blockchain technology to establish a secure and transparent infrastructure to support emerging tennis talent. The NTF dApp enables fans to sponsor young and underprivileged players through funds generated by launchpad mints and commercial sponsorship deals. \n2. **Player Exclusive Launchpad & Drops**: This feature allows established players and potential professionals to tokenize a portion of their anticipated earnings, providing financial support. The platform offers two types of drops: Professional Drops (seasonal tokens) and Prospect Drops (sponsorship tokens), catering to different stages of a player‚Äôs career. \n3. **The Fam Section**: An exclusive content and social networking dashboard for NTF Asset holders, providing access to exclusive content, networking opportunities, and various benefits determined by the athletes. \n4. **Athletes & Valuation**: The platform features verified ATP and WTA players and up-and-coming prospects, with advisory and selection support from Borna‚Äôs management agency, Kozmos Holding. Drops are valued individually, with tokens representing a fraction of the total fractionalized prize money. Professional player valuations are based on historical performance data and a proprietary model, while prospect valuations involve negotiations and selection for either a Prospect pool or a Player exclusive drop, guided by the expertise of Kozmos Holding.\n\nTogether, NounsTennisFam and NounsDAO can actively support emerging tennis superstars by addressing one of their most significant challenges‚Äìfunding, while providing a framework for established professionals to enter the Web3 space through fractionalized earnings. This approach will strengthen our brand and further democratizes the sport of tennis. Additionally, this collaboration will place NounsTennisFam at the forefront of a vast global tennis market, valued at $5.6 billion in 2019 (Source: ITF). Notably, 46% of global tennis fans have a household income of $75,000 or more (Source: ITF), representing a demographic well-suited to become NounsDAO community members.\n\n# Existing Partnerships and Collaborations\n\nNounsTennisFam has already established integral strategic partnerships with tennis academies, professional players, sport management giants, and Web3 projects that enhance the platform‚Äôs features and user experience. Our collaborations within the tennis industry allow us to tap into the impressive viewership numbers of events, such as the Wimbledon 2019, with a peak audience of 9.6 million viewers in the UK alone (Source: BBC), and the French Open 2020 final, with a peak audience of 3.3 million viewers in France (Source: SportsPro). \n\nThese partnerships provide credibility and enable NounsTennisFam to engage with tennis fans and connect with Web3 natives through our blockchain partners. By utilizing these alliances, we will expand our reach to tennis enthusiasts and the growing Web3 community, fostering a comprehensive and sustainable ecosystem for developing elite tennis talent and increasing fan engagement.\n\n## Meet our Athletes\n\nProfessional supporters actively promoting the platform and its vision to their extensive fan bases, generating global awareness and support for the project.\n\n- **Borna ƒÜoriƒá** (ATP Rank #20)\n- **Luka Modriƒá** (Real Madrid)\n- **Ajla Tomljanoviƒá** (WTA Rank #47)\n- **Marin Cilic** (ATP Rank #22)\n- **Ana Konjuh** (WTA Rank #145)\n- **Marcelo Brozovic** (Midfielder, Inter Milan)\n- **Filip Krajinovic** (ATP Rank #65)\n- **Donna Vekic** (WTA Rank #32) \n\n## Web3 Collaborators\n\nOur Web3 partnership will bring fans and players together and help make tennis successful on the blockchain.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 304 - Nouns to fund a MEV relay that saved Ethereum from OFAC censorship dystopia (for now)",
      "content": "# Nouns to fund a MEV relay that saved Ethereum from OFAC censorship dystopia (for now)\n\n## TL;DR\n\n* The [ultra sound relay](https://relay.ultrasound.money/) is the largest MEV-boost relay by market share and importantly a non-censoring credibly neutral relay playing a pivotal role in maintaining Ethereum's censorship resistant properties.\n* The relay has operated as a public good funded by donations since inception and would very much welcome Nouns' contribution (according to [Justin Drake](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin), one of the team members).\n* This proposal suggests making a substantial 100 ETH donation to recognize the incredible feat, express our Ethereum-aligned values, and reach prospective DAO members who share our values.\n\n---\n\n## Context\n\nLast year post-Merge, there was a meaningful public concern around the rising level of censorship in Ethereum due to the (then dominant) Flashbots relay censoring OFAC transactions. At its peak, [block censorship reached ~80%](https://www.mevwatch.info/).\n\nIn response to the public concern, the Flashbots team accelerated [open sourcing their relay code](https://writings.flashbots.net/Flashbots-Relay-open-sourcing) and many teams sprinted towards building non-censoring relay alternatives.\n\nTwo such relays succeeded in gaining meaningful traction‚Äîthe [ultra sound relay](https://relay.ultrasound.money/) and the [Agnostic relay](https://www.gnosis.io/blog/agnostic-relay-a-credibly-neutral-tool) by the Gnosis team‚Äîresulting in the dramatic reduction of censored blocks earlier this year.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJo0cF7I2.png)\n(screenshot from [mevboost.pics](https://mevboost.pics/))\n\nIt's worth noting that such gains in relay market share was not attained simply by launching a copy-paste non-censoring fork of the Flashbots relay. The ultra sound relay team had to actually build a lower latency relay through innovations of their own such as [optimistic](https://github.com/michaelneuder/optimistic-relay-documentation/blob/main/proposal.md) [relaying](https://github.com/ultrasoundmoney/mev-boost-relay/blob/prod-optimistic-relaying/docs/optimistic/an-optimistic-weekend.md) and various devops optimizations.\n\nultra sound relay's market share has been capped around 33% lately because the team is committed to self-cap its dominance to 1/3 of Ethereum blocks to foster relay diversity. They are also working closely with [Mike Neuder](https://twitter.com/mikeneuder) from the EF to help accelerate R&D for [enshrined PBS](https://ethresear.ch/t/why-enshrine-proposer-builder-separation-a-viable-path-to-epbs/15710) that would eliminate the need for relays entirely.\n\n---\n\n## Why should Nouns fund the ultra sound relay?\n\n**1. To continue to express our alignment with Ethereum and its values.**\n\nNouns is a [headless brand](https://otherinter.net/research/headless-brands/). There is no PR head that builds coherent brand identities. Instead, we are what we do.\n\nSo far our track record is strong:\n* We've always held our treasury entirely in ETH or stETH.\n* We've always focused on decentralization and onchain governance.\n* We've always insisted on open sourcing wherever possible, including our own brand IP.\n* We've always cared deeply about public goods.\n\nIt's important to continue these things. To have an identity. To be who we are.\n\nEthereum-aligned public goods we've funded so far in our history:\n* [Prop 21](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) ‚Äî donating 169 ETH to Gitcoin grants.\n* [Prop 108](https://nouns.wtf/vote/108) ‚Äî donating 500 ETH to Ethereum protocol development via the Protocol Guild.\n* [Prop 184](https://nouns.wtf/vote/184) ‚Äî donating 100 ETH to ZachXBT.\n* [Prop 249](https://nouns.wtf/vote/249) ‚Äî giving out 30 ETH to Ethereum solo stakers.\n* [Prop 278](https://nouns.wtf/vote/278) ‚Äî donating 55 ETH to the Gitcoin crypto advocacy round.\n\nWe should be proud of what we've done so far but we must continue. Ethereum-aligned public goods are the substrates of our onchain world and funding them is an important expression of who we are and what we stand for.\n\n**2. To reach prospective DAO members that also care about Ethereum and the onchain world.**\n\nCharismatic giving towards public goods creates [news](https://www.theblock.co/post/193256/nouns-dao-donates-to-zachxbt) and generates [viral attention](https://twitter.com/noun40__/status/1598084457596325888) like anything else we might fund in an attempt to proliferate our brand and attract the attention of prospective DAO members.\n\nFunding Ethereum public goods is particularly useful in this regard since ETH holders and onchain world enthusiasts who care about Ethereum public goods are also (at least currently) our primary prospective DAO member demographic.\n\n---\n\n# Other details\n\n**Who is on the ultra sound relay team?**\n[AlphaMonad](https://twitter.com/AlphaMonad) leads the dev effort, with support from [alex](https://twitter.com/alextes) and [Justin Drake](https://twitter.com/drakefjustin).\n\n**Does the ultra sound money team need the funding?**\nThis proposal is meant to recognize what has been accomplished (more like an award) not necessarily fund future work so the proposal does not focus on this aspect. However, the team communicated that funding is currently very tight, cloud bills alone costing ~$15k per month, so the funding would be very welcome.\n\n**What other funding sources does ultra sound relay team have?**\nA 10 ETH per month no-strings-attached donation from a top MEV-boost builder is the primary funding source according to the team.\n\n**Any conflict of interest?**\nThe proposer ([Noun 40](https://twitter.com/noun40__)) has no prior (or planned future) personal or business relationship with anyone on the ultra sound relay team.  Reaching out to ask for permission to make this proposal was the first and only connection.\n\n**Why not also fund the Agnostic relay by the Gnosis team as well?**\nThe ETH prize felt a bit superflous given that the Gnosis DAO has a [$260M treasury](https://zapper.xyz/daos/gnosis-dao) of their own but they definitely deserve high praise for stepping up and maintaining a successful non-censoring public good relay as well!",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 303 - TSP x ASK Long Beach: Silverado Skatepark",
      "content": "# TSP x ASK Long Beach: Silverado Skatepark\n\n![ASK Pic 1](https://i.imgur.com/56b3Zqj.png)\n\n### OPPORTUNITY\nWe seek funding to revitalize Silverado Park Skatepark in Long Beach, California, with new elements and relocate the ones that are still skateable. A collaborative design between Spohn Ranch Skateparks and Keen Ramps for a new, all-concrete park is ready to be built and now just needs the funding to complete the build. The area surrounding the skatepark is predominantly low-income, with many at-risk youths with few recreational opportunities. Together with the local Action Sports Kids (ASK) Foundation, we will unlock the potential of Silverado Skatepark to create a space that will benefit Long Beach area skaters, youth and community members for generations to come.\n\n\n### [THE SKATEPARK PROJECT](https://skatepark.org/)\nThe Skatepark Project (TSP) builds more than skateparks. We build confidence. We build perseverance. We build community. \n\nFounded by Tony Hawk in 2002, TSP is a nonprofit organization working to increase access to outdoor recreation and free play in underserved communities through the creation of safe and inclusive skateparks. To date, TSP has helped build nearly 700 skateparks in underserved communities across the United States serving nearly 9 million skaters each year.\n\n\n### ACTION SPORTS KIDS (ASK) FOUNDATION\nFounded by former Long Beach City Councilman Mike Donelon and a group of skaters in 1996, Action Sports Kids (ASK) Foundation is a nonprofit in Long Beach, California, dedicated to providing youth an alternative to the streets and gangs through sports, education and community involvement. Their efforts to keep their team members in school, out of gangs, off the streets and involved in their community through skateboarding has been recognized by the Long Beach Unified School District and the City of Long Beach.\n\nASK is responsible for all 10 Long Beach skateparks. Their skate team has more than 175 members, ages 3-25, comprised of diverse genders and ethnicities, and applications continue to come in every day. \n\n### PROJECT OVERVIEW\nThe effort to reimagine the Silverado Skatepark began in April 2021 with the encouragement of local skaters. The 5,000-square-foot skatepark was built on an old basketball court located on the west side of Long Beach, California. Separated by the Los Angeles River from the rest of the city, it is the only skatepark in underserved West Long Beach. The elements in the park were relocated from the Michael K. Green and Bixby (Cherry) Skateparks after their respective refurbishment. Dew Tour also donated some in 2018. The park has undergone many repairs over the years. With the exception of a few elements, most are unrepairable and render the park useless due to excessive use.\n\nThe skatepark project has been approved by the office of City of Long Beach Councilmember Roberto Uranga and the City of Long Beach Department of Parks, Recreation and Marine. On September 16, 2021, the City issued a two-year right of access to build the skatepark.\n\n![Skatepark Pic](https://i.imgur.com/Or8RX6g.png)\n![Skatepark Pic2](https://i.imgur.com/uVjAGeg.png)\n*‚ÄúOur mission at ASK is to empower youth through sports, education, and community. This skatepark is in an underserved area and was heavily used. Rebuilding it will bring back a beloved activity and after-school alternative for at-risk youth.‚Äù* - Mike Donelon, founder and executive director of ASK\n\n\n\n### FUNDING OPPORTUNITY\nThis proposal requests a total of ~87 ETH upfront from the DAO for the entire project. See attached cost breakdown.\n\n![Skate Park Reno](https://i.imgur.com/jgimcz9.png)\n***Sample Mockup, exact art not shown.** Detailed Nouns Artwork (Noun Characters, Noggles, ect) will be illustrated on various fixtures throughout the park.*\n\n### TIMELINE\nThe project is expected to take a maximum of four weeks to complete. The exact start date depends on the builders‚Äô schedule, but ASK anticipates beginning the construction during summer 2023. Please note the schedule can only be finalized once funding is secured.\n\n\n**Nouns Artwork** ‚Äî The Nouns artwork and noggles rail have been viewed and approved by the Long Beach Parks and Recreation Commission. Keen Ramps has recommended working with Van Eggers (@van_eggers), a talented illustrator working out of Long Beach. He has done work for clients such as Foundation Skateboards, Girl Skateboards and Deathwish Skateboards. Oni Apenoun will be coordinating with ASK and Van Eggers to provide assets and assist in creative direction.\n\n**Noggles Rail** ‚Äî Keen Ramps will manage building, powder coating and installing the signature Noggles Rail.\n\nUpon approval of funding, Spohn Ranch will carry out the project according to the original design, excluding the Nouns rail and artwork. Subsequently, they will handle the installation of the noogles rail and the painting of the artwork.\n\n### TSP PARTNERSHIP PROMOTION\nTSP will promote the partnership and funding support through dedicated social media posts on TSP's platforms. Additionally, TSP will include relevant tags and mentions in social media posts related to the skatepark project, extending its reach and generating a significant impact.\n\n### NOUNS X ASK LONG BEACH PARTNERSHIP HISTORY\n**October 2022** ‚Äî Nouns DAO partnered with ASK Long Beach and TSP to give away skateboards to local youth at their team meeting/jams at Houghton Skatepark. The boards were funded and designed by Nouns DAO and built by TSP staff and volunteers.\n\n![Skatepark Kids Pic](https://i.imgur.com/0MftGcz.png)\n\n**January  2023** ‚Äî  ASK Long Beach skateboarders showed their stuff aboard the ‚ÄúMeet the Nouns‚Äù float in the 134th annual Rose Parade in Pasadena, California. Mike Donelon and several team skaters participated, with some kids on the float and others skateboarding alongside it as it traveled down the parade route.\n\n![Rose Parade Pic](https://i.imgur.com/X8qWJyy.png)\n\n\n![Budget1](https://i.imgur.com/k8J1rs1.png)\n![Budget2](https://i.imgur.com/uiChV7P.png)\n\n\n= ~86.7 ETH @ 1892 USD / ETH\n \n### Transaction Details\n```\ntx1: One time payment to TSP\ntx2: USDC Auto-refill transaction automatically added to top off the DAO's USDC Funding Pool for future Proposals\n```",

A longer post about the other V3 features will be posted between now and the upgrade proposal.\n\n## Context on how it's audited\n\nGiven the complexity of the DAO V3 upgrade, a second audit is necessary to uncover potential vulnerabilities potentially missed in the first round.\n\n* On June 1st we started the first audit with [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/), using funds Tech Grants already had. This audit is underway and should end around June 20th.\n* We're allocating roughly two weeks between the first and second audit for fixes that may arise, and a chance for the Spearbit auditors to review those fixes.\n* On the week of July 3rd we hope to start the code4rena audit, which should take 10 days, with an option to pay for a 'mitigations review', which we're likely to want if there are any non-negligible issues that come up in this audit.\n\n## Budget\n\ncode4rena's quote consists of:\n1. $148K for the audit, out of which $100K are the pool prize going to auditors.\n2. $50K for the optional mitigations review.\n\nComes out to $198K; we're rounding up our request to $200K to have another slight buffer.\n\nAny unused funds will be sent back to the DAO.",

      "content": "# Artmatr x Nouns - 1,001 Nouns\n\n[![image15.png](https://i.postimg.cc/bvysn37N/image15.png)](https://postimg.cc/qNFJVXB9)\n\n_Thank you to Lil Nouns for your support and feedback over the last week. We garnered [record support from the DAO](https://lilnouns.proplot.wtf/idea/529), as well as valuable feedback from many members that helped improve our prop. We look forward to supporting the Lils and being part of the community!_\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## TL;DR:\n\n* We are proposing to use our Matr Labs robotics to fabricate 1,001 Nouns on-demand from #0 to #1,000. Artmatr will develop custom software and hardware to pull off this feat, including an exclusive airdropped physical redemption token, MATRing portal with algorithmic and AI creative control, cutting edge tool development, and the extensive code development required to tie it all together. All Noun holders will have the right to customize and claim their respective physical copy(s).  \n* All shipping and handling costs to deliver the physical work to community members will be covered by Artmatr. We will create or employ a shipping system that ensures anonymity of any address information needed.\n* Complementary digital content, including timelapse videos and high-resolution photography, will be available to Nouns holders and the community, and the airdropped redemption tokens will update to display the MATRed Nouns upon completion.\n* We will produce a massive Nouniversary event at Artmatr‚Äôs gallery, showcasing some of the first MATRed Nouns with live MATRing throughout the day.\n* This project will add a significant amount of new value to existing Nouns mints, as well as upcoming auctions. The content created by each Noun‚Äôs MATRing process will be widely distributed and shared, elevating visibility of the innovative ways Nouns can be works of art IRL, and the Nouniversary will be an opportunity to showcase that! We will also allocate any secondary royalties of the Matr Labs x Nouns token to the Nouns treasury.\n[![UIUX-GIF-1.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/SRSqsxjZ/UIUX-GIF-1.gif)](https://postimg.cc/62mFbwrR)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## Overview\n\nOur [last prop](https://nouns.wtf/vote/224) allowed Artmatr the opportunity to develop and create seven unique paintings of Nouns over the course of one week in March. Each day‚Äôs minted Noun was interpreted by our team of artists and engineers and ‚ÄúMATRed‚Äù on the same day as a 48‚Äù x 48‚Äù oil painting with our custom robotic hardware and code. The winner of each auction was given the rights to the corresponding painting. We celebrated the week of Nouns art with a successful public exhibition and VIP opening in our Brooklyn gallery, attended by major artists, gallerists, and auctioneers from the New York art scene.\n\nWe‚Äôre excited to follow up on the success of Prop 224 with a massive endeavor to bring physical art to every Nouner in the world. With the help of the Nouns community‚Äôs creative input, we propose to MATR 1,001 Nouns and distribute them globally to their respective holders. [Each Noun-holding wallet will be airdropped a Matr Labs token that can be redeemed for a physical. ](https://vimeo.com/830696167)We will update the metadata of the token upon redemption with a hi-res image of the Matr‚Äôd Noun, which will provide a digital Certificate of Authenticity for each physical piece of art. Supporting this huge development and production effort, we will deploy curated content across a variety of social channels, raising visibility of Nouns DAO and the ways Nouns create value and delight for the both broader Web3 community as well as the community of artists and art collectors that we are fostering.\n\nThis project aims to return on investment to the Nouns DAO in as many ways as possible, through high-quality content, marketing, and sponsorship visibility. We will publicly celebrate this endeavor with a huge launch party and exhibition near the August 8th Nouniversary and we will continue to promote this effort through dedicated social channels throughout the rest of the year and into 2024. We also propose that one of our cutting-edge MATR Labs machine racks gets built with custom Nouns sponsorship visibility, so that Noggles and Nouns branding can be seen in the content generated by every piece of art created on the machine. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## Recap\n[![image6.png](https://i.postimg.cc/B6wL4HwZ/image6.png)](https://postimg.cc/njBc1jJN)\n\nProp 224 passed on February 13, 2023, to a resounding yes vote of 151 to 17. We immediately began developing ways we could use our custom robots and software to create a unique oil painting for each Noun over the prescribed week. We developed a number of stylistic directions that required new tools and hours of code development. Ultimately, we created paintings with unique robotically-created textures in the oil paint that brought dimensionality and life to Nouns, and embedded the mint hash into the paintings as well.\n\n[![image9.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/NF9yMFW6/image9.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/4HG42f4y)\n\nWe wrote thousands of lines of code to reinterpret the digital images as paintings, honed the tooling, mixed the paint, and arranged the cameras. As proposed, we completed a unique painting of that day‚Äôs Noun, on time, and live streamed the entire process, as well as a 3D scan of each finished work for our virtual gallery. The project pushed our technical limits to the edge and allowed us to try new creative techniques that have greatly improved our art-making processes as a whole.\n\n[![image17.png](https://i.postimg.cc/q71gx2rc/image17.png)](https://postimg.cc/Nyrgg95L)\n\nDuring production time our Twitter and Instagram feeds were full of Nouns as our content and marketing team came up with new and creative ways to showcase the community through the paintings. The project generated great buzz from the community, and generated auction prices above the previous 30-day average, including a 36.69 ETH sale on the genesis painting. The week was capped off with a successful [first-ever exhibition in the Artmatr space in Brooklyn](https://vimeo.com/829178232). The works have been seen and talked about by major collectors, artists, galleries and auction houses, including Christie‚Äôs, Pace, Pioneer Works, and many other VIP‚Äôs in the crypto and traditional art communities. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n[![image3.png](https://i.postimg.cc/mrBFwbH4/image3.png)](https://postimg.cc/87X5kg4X)\n[![image11.png](https://i.postimg.cc/QtPtRsHH/image11.png)](https://postimg.cc/TLVfDzj6)\n[![image18.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wMmvzPmF/image18.png)](https://postimg.cc/RJv9QgGn)\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nSince the passing and success of our last Prop, Artmatr has grown significantly. We‚Äôve scaled up, adding seasoned Project, Operations, and Product Managers, as well as building a dedicated 3 person marketing team. Our engineering team has also expanded, driving our hardware and software development at breakneck speeds. We held an exhibition opening with Zancan at our Brooklyn gallery space that 500 people attended, and other art from the Artmatr lab has been shown at Pace Gallery and Unit London, among other established galleries worldwide. Our Twitter following has more than doubled, and we engage with a diverse and growing audience across our popular Tik Tok, Instagram, Twitch, and Discord channels. Our organic reach has been very strong, maintaining an impressive 10.5% average engagement rate, with over 400k impressions in the period following the original Prop.\n\nWe learned specific lessons from the execution of our first proposal. The most important thing is that we want to prioritize total community engagement, both the whole Nouns community and our growing Web3-curious traditional art world community. By scaling down the final pieces and allowing anyone to MATR a Noun using a redemption token, we think this project will have a much broader impact. We also want to stress the effort that we plan to put into this project to raise visibility of the Nouns DAO through our social channels. We see each MATRed piece as an opportunity to spread the word about the creativity of the community and promote the brand, and our automated cameras will capture and produce a timelapse video of the MATRing process of each created work. We will also explore collaborative Nouns MATRing with our community of blue-chip artists.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## New Prop\n[![Untitled.png](https://i.postimg.cc/2SDp85Jn/Untitled.png)](https://postimg.cc/nC0S3nnL)\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nOur new Matr Labs platform consisting of newly developed art-making software and scaled down versions of our large machines will incorporate technology distilled from our experiences with the likes of Tyler Hobbs, Zancan and other brilliant artists we work with. The technology is entering a production-ready state from an initial prototype, and we want the Nouns community to work with us as we continue to develop and scale. We are committed to pushing the envelope of technological creativity, and with the assistance of Nouns DAO, we will help define the bridge between digital and physical artwork for a future generation of artists. \n\n[![image16.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Z0zq5cPm/image16.png)](https://postimg.cc/D45hC1Yp)\n\nWe would like to propose that every Noun holder from #0 to #1000 will have the opportunity to use our new platform and generate a unique 18‚Äù x 18‚Äù unique physical rendition of a Noun (their own, another from the collection, or a new noun from the Playground). Each MATRed Noun will be shipped to the holder at no additional cost, worldwide. \n\n[![image12.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MHCnjxSh/image12.png)](https://postimg.cc/ctcxVp6m)\n\n_User flow: User starts by connecting their wallet & choosing their Noun on the server > Personalizes the Noun > server generated a preview with the translation layer > users has three choices: Modify the artwork, Save the preview for consideration or send to MATR > during the MATRing process, the work is captured in high res and when the MATR process is finished, the work is minted and shipped._\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe key to MATRing a physical Noun will be the 1,0001 redemption tokens, which will be airdropped to all wallets holding Nouns and will continue to be distributed as new Nouns are minted and won - up to #1,000. In the spirit of Noun‚Äôs CC0 license, a redemption token holder will be able to use any Noun in the collection as inspiration for their physical. The tokens can also be traded in the event that a holder does not want a physical, and royalties will be sent to the treasury.\n\n[![](https://i.postimg.cc/PxwJnx90/Group-10.png)](https://vimeo.com/830696167)\n\nThe physical pieces created by the Nouns community and anyone outside who acquires a redemption token will generate increased visibility and value to the DAO, as existing holders and new auction winners alike will be given the opportunity to create a physical representation of their Noun with their own creative input. This creates both physical permanence for the Nouns in the world, as well as the possibility for virality for every related social media post that is shared. Additionally, we will also brand our newly-produced robot with Nouns branding, elevating Nouns visibility alongside the growth of this initiative. This machine will get heavy use, with time lapses and photos being core to the creation process, so the Nouns will be visually associated with the works created by incredible artists using the same tech.\n\n[![image4.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qvdtJkQK/image4.png)](https://postimg.cc/VdDs4Pxs)\n*_Concept of Nouns Sponsored Matr Labs Rack_*\n\nHaving the Nouns community with us will give us the freedom to come up with exciting new ways to implement our technology that we may not otherwise have been able to do when operating within the constraints of an individual artist. We want to continue pushing the boundaries of our technology in order to make art that excites both the Nouns community and our community at-large.\n[![image13.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/k4DG1DM0/image13.gif)](https://postimg.cc/mzfThLHj)\nWe are eager to develop and employ our new tech at the epic scale that it was built for. We went big with this project, and want the community to feel that their money is well spent. It is easy to quantify the project on a per-print cost basis, but do keep in mind that we are also committing to a constant stream of content, marketing, and PR on behalf of the Nouns DAO, an epic NYC event as part of the Nouniversary celebrations, and development of a new Matr Labs robot that will be Nouns sponsored and branded. We feel that these intangibles will bring a lot of value and visibility to the community, while allowing us the opportunity to build the tech to its full potential in a shortened period of  time. \n[![image10.png](https://i.postimg.cc/GmJ49ZS5/image10.png)](https://postimg.cc/MnH6Frw7)\n[![image14.png](https://i.postimg.cc/T2pt8XkG/image14.png)](https://postimg.cc/rz21W7XY)\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n## Timeline & Milestones\n\n* Immediately following the acceptance of the proposal, Artmatr will begin development of a custom Nouns DAO creative interface and the construction of a Nouns-sponsored Matr Labs rack. We will open up private social channels on Discord and provide regular updates on the progress made on both the hardware and software development. We will stay active in those channels for enthusiasts of the technology to engage with our team of artists and engineers and also promote the project development publicly via our Twitter & Instagram. \n* Artmatr will use the community Nouns as our test materials during the summer development process, and will publish the results as the works are formed.\n* Near the public launch of the Matr portal, we will airdrop Matr Labs x Nouns redemption tokens to all wallets holding Nouns. We will continue to distribute those tokens to new holders up to #1,000.\n* We will officially launch the token-gated Nouns website for the community to start generating works using the Nouns on August 1. Shortly thereafter, we will h\n\n\n---\n\nTHIS PROP IS LONGER THAN THE MAX LENGTH FOR SNAPSHOT:\n\n Read the rest of the prop at https://nouns.wtf/vote/301",

      "title": "SNP - SD Comic Con: Connecting a Cornucopia of Creators",
      "content": "Should SharkDAO put the following proposal on-chain at NounsDAO and vote FOR?\n\n**TLDR:**\nNouns Town crew will head to SD Comic Con to gift 2,500 Nouns Activity Books to artists and collectors and commission 100+ Nounish artworks from industry pros + proliferate the meme through friends and peer collaborations.\nTotal cots $57,500.00\n\n**SD Comic Con: Connecting a Cornucopia of Creators**\nSan Diego Comicon happens in July of 2023, and is a gathering of fans of pop culture, along with the artists that create content for them. With six figures of people walking through the doors, it has become one of the largest gatherings for talented people in the world. Those that write and draw comics, books, web series, movies and television, everyone goes to connect to the fans that keep them employed and appreciate them.\n\nBringing in outside artists to Nouns would be a huge boon to the ecosystem. It would bring different creative perspectives to an artistic project, but also bring in a fan base that currently has no real visibility to Nouns. If we engage creators, get them excited, we have already seen that they will then plug themselves into Nouns, engage with Nouns, while still engaging with the medium they are experts in.\n\nNouns is in a unique position to make dreams come true for creators that would otherwise be dissatisfied with their lot in their industry. If Eastman and Laird (the creators of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) had access to Nouns, not only would they have brought Nouns iconography to their books, but they would have had an outlet to seek funding, letting Nouns fund the Turtles, which would later become a licensing juggernaut. This is a perfect end use case for Nouns collabs with creators.\n\nOur first step is to go to San Diego, connect with as many creatives as we can. We will get them to do commissioned work (which we will pay for) in a special Nouns sketch book, of which we will print many copies. This will let us open a dialogue with them to discuss Nouns, cc0, the benefits of the ecosystem, and how they might benefit from introducing themselves here.\n\nWe will aim for over **100 creators‚Äô commissions**, giving Nouns many different versions and interpretations of Nouns and Nounish things from established artists, introduce the artists to us and cc0, and finally create inroads for further exploration in the near future. We will spread our net wide, but go for the premier artists in the industry (Jim Lee, Todd McFarlane, Geoff Darrow, etc.) along with the more traditional artists. Having been in this industry for two dozen years, I am comfortable saying I can have a conversation with any level of talent.\n\n**Nouns Sketch Book :** We will print 2,500 copies of a Nouns sketch book, with pages from the Nouns comic book contained within, as well as colouring pages, how to draw Nouns, and blank pages. We will give these away to creators, encouraging them to fill up the blank pages and give them back at the end.\n\n**Commission payments :** This is the main source of income for creators at conventions, so we will be paying for each commissioned work. We will specify that we wish something to do with Nouns (and the pages containing Nouns will give them plenty of reference material). The rate paid will be dependent upon the work they are doing, along with what their standard rate is. As a rough estimate, we will aim to pay $300 USD for a full sketch of a Noun in the creators‚Äô style.\n\nWe will need to have the books printed and delivered to San Diego no later than July 17th of 2023. This means we wish to be at the printer by the last week of June, which is our goal. Having decades of experience making monthly comic books, I am comfortable saying this will be 100% achievable. We have the designers, printers, shipper and storage lined up. It was essential to plot out the viability of accomplishing this prior to suggesting it.\n\n**Who:** Nouns Town team of Danny Schlitz, Adam & Bennet + Joshua Fisher\n\n**How Much:**\n$15,000 USD - Creating, Printing and Shipping 2,500 Nouns Sketch Books\n$30,000 USD - Commission Payments for 100+ Commissions\n$12,5000 USD - Adam, Josh, Danny & Bennet will be there manage the facilitation of the books and creators, as well as scanning the art pieces for the DAO afterwards. This covers travel and per diem costs. \n\n**$57,500 USD - Total ask**\n\nProp by: @defaulteduser / Adam + Joshua Fisher",

Naturally, even fewer people know about nouns.\n\nHowever, due to the growth of the blockchain field and the fact that nouns and Noggles are IPs using CC0We imagine that nouns and Noggles will gradually penetrate the market and become a commonplace part of society in the future.\nThis is the timeline we are aiming for and realizing, we believe that participating in the Web3 Conference is very meaningful.\n\n\n## Concept\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**‚Äú Mirai ‚Äù means Future.**\n\n\n„ÄúThe future of nouns and noggles in Japan.  \n„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄ„ÄÄA place to showcase such a future, one step ahead„Äú\n\n\n![Áî∞Â∑ù„Åï„Çì„ÅÆ„Ç≥„É≥„Çª„Éó„Éà„Ç¢„Éº„Éà](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=17MZIZqPcUGiz_xfOsM7sJg34HF0VqjsG)\n\n**Key visual„ÄÄ‚ÄùPop Pop Tokyo‚Äù**\n\n\n*PROLOGUE*\n*Nounsdao is a new organization called dao, built by web3 technology, with the philosophy of making the world more enjoyable through character and art.*\n\n*The activities of dao are helping to integrate nouns among people around the world and create the beloved Mirai.

We will introduce the future of the fusion of nouns and Japan to visitors using the spirit of harmony (exhibition), art (live painting), and metaverse (technology).\n\n\n## Key Points\n\nNouns characters and Noggles will blend naturally with Tatami mats and Japanese culture, showing the futuristic fun of mixed culture.\n\nWe will set up a unique and different Japanese-style room in the business conference space to provide visitors with the experience of taking off their shoes and sitting on tatami mats.\n\nIn the Tatami room, noggle type VR glasses will be provided. Each guest will be guided to Nouns street in Co-Mati, a Japanese-style space in the Metaverse Spatial space, using their own smartphone. Various real and virtual hospitality related to Nouns will be offered here.\n\n\n\n## ‚ÄúNoren‚Äù and ‚ÄúTea room‚Äù that invite you to Mirai\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n![Ëå∂ÂÆ§„Å®ÊöñÁ∞æ„ÅÆÁµµ](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-lnd16j4m-dZbNEcswOCfmM7yhktCRgn)\n\n\n„ÄúThe spirit of Japanese hospitality \"Teahouse\" and the sense of anticipation after passing through the \"noren\" curtain.This \"tearoom\" is used as a \"portal\" to connect to Nouns' Mirai = \"Future\".\n\nJapanese hospitality is based on the spirit of \"tea ceremony,\" a form of hospitality that is appropriate to not be pretentious\nThe \"noren\" (traditional Japanese curtains) hanging in front of stores in Japan are not only used as signboards, but are also used to show the store's credibility and pride. Such a uniquely Japanese interior is expressed in a small space of 3m‚úñÔ∏è3m.\n\nVisitors pass through the noren (curtain) and are invited to enter a small but isolated Japanese space with tatami mats. In this small space, we commissioned a master craftsman and a noren workshop to create a small Japanese room that can be incorporated into modern life, creating an interior that makes the most of the small space.\n\n\n\n## Live Painting -Drawing Mirai on a pure white campus\n---\n\n\n![Áî∞Â∑ù„Åï„Çì„ÅÆÂà∂‰ΩúÂÜôÁúü](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1RbpKX_psTCrz5T4Qy-_B3-SolAl5fpIV)\n\n\n[üîóLive painting activity video by Mr. Tagawa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU1USuJtVLU) \n\n\n\nAt the booth, a live painting event will be held, where Makoto Tagawa, a painter, will create a key visual of NounsMiraiJAPAN from scratch on a pure white wall of 2.7m‚úñÔ∏è3.0m.

      "content": "# Nouns Display Font\n\n\n[![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJ4YIVpSn.png)](https://marcokane.com/nouns_display.mp4)\n[Watch promo video](https://marcokane.com/nouns_display.mp4)\n\n    \n## TLDR\nWhy don‚Äôt we have a proper Nounish display font? Let‚Äôs make one that everybody can use. Recognizable, fun, CC0. For Nouns projects, products and beyond. \nRequesting 18 eth. \n\n### See the draft letter drawings in use: [nounsfonts.wtf](https://nounsfonts.wtf)\n\n## WHY\nOn websites, videos, gear, and other items, the display typeface a user sees is one of the most critical aspects of visual recognition. \n    \nA display typeface performs numerous functions like an oft-needed guide for a weary traveler. It reassures users, gives them a good feeling, creates understanding, and establishes direction. Of all the typefaces used in Nouns materials‚Äìoutside of Nountown‚Äìnone feel particularly Nounish. This is because there aren‚Äôt any genuinely Nounish display fonts available for use. We aim to solve that‚ÄìNouners need more tools for their evergrowing toolbox to help spread the lore of Nouns.\n    \nThe [Nountown](https://nouns.center/assets) typeface is inspiring. Picking up where Gremplin left off, I propose creating a unique, beautiful, functional Nounish display typeface with a CC0 license available for general use. We use CC0, so this font can be a starting point for a whole suite of open-source Nounish fonts, bolstering the ecosystem visually. **Nouns Display is a font L1 that many L2s can be built on. Eg., Nouns Display and lil nouns display.**\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1_CqbhBn.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1Xaobnr2.png)\n   \nThanks to the generous support of our [prop house proposal](https://prop.house/proposal/5071) we have a start. The initial sketches, and process can be seen on our microsite [nounsfonts.wtf ](https://nounsfonts.wtf)\n\nThis proposal allows us to finish a full-featured CCO typeface that everyone can use on nouns projects, products, and beyond.\n\n    \n## GETTING IT OUT THERE\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJCC9AsH3.jpg)\n\nWe will produce a limited run of distinctly tasteful gear featuring the typeface upon launch.\n\nWe will submit Nouns Display for inclusion in the Google Fonts catalogue for wide distribution and easy use in Figma. \n    \nIt will be used on [Zora‚Äôs new profiles pages](https://zora.co/profiles). \n    \nWe will structure a Zora-based NFT launch when the typeface is complete. **Nouns Display would be the first NFT of a usable production typeface, effectively disrupting the typeface industry with NFTs and opening up a new paradigm for fonts as financial assets.**\n\n\n## WHO\nI am Marco Braunschweiler, a designer with a background in art, and I make typefaces that I use everyday. I‚Äôve worked with Tribute Labs, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, Acura, Sonos, The New York Times, and NTS Radio.\n\nMy fonts are here: [m-a-r-c-o.com/typefaces](https://m-a-r-c-o.com/typefaces)\nMy design studio is here: [openwindow.studio](https://openwindow.studio)\n\n\n## ROADMAP\nPhase 1 is complete. This proposal is for phases 2, and 3. Requesting 18 ETH.\n\n**Phase One ‚Äì Complete**\n*Initial Sketches of Uppercase Letterforms*\nWe want to make sure we‚Äôre getting it right and creating something everyone loves; in this phase, we‚Äôve done the research and made sketches for the initial letters, uppercase A‚ÄìZ. Results are viewable at [nounsfonts.wtf](https://nounsfonts.wtf).\n\n\n**Phase Two ‚Äì Up Next**\n*Drawing all Latin Glyphs*\nNow that research is done and a direction is established, we draw all the uppercase and lowercase Latin glyphs. At the end of this phase, we will have drawings of all the characters used. We will work with Nounish designers to test the typeface and collect feedback.\n\n    \n**Phase Three ‚Äì Finish Line**\n*Updates, Revision, Mastering*\nThe finish line. We work to refine the typeface and master it for use across platforms. At the end of this phase, we have the final files that anyone can use to make their projects, and the world, look a bit more Nounish.\n\n    \n**Spec Sheet**\nFinal typeface will be ready for wide-use, and will include the following:\n* CC0 License\n* Mastering\n* Hinting\n* Unicode data normalization\n* Opentype feature checks\n* Metrics normalization/optimisation for desktop, mobile, and web environments\n* Generating final desktop and webfont files in: OTF, TTF, WOFF, WOFF2\n* Submission to Google Fonts \n        \n\n### Thank you for reading, and for your consideration.",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 298 - Introducing Noun Computers - An Ethereum Node Prototype",
      "content": "# Introducing Noun Computers - An Ethereum Node Prototype\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BibDiu5.png)\n\n## TL;DR\nIntroducing Noun Computers! I propose to fund the development of credit card-sized computers that would be ideal for Ethereum staking.\n\nNounsDAO's commitment to making individual staking fun and popular would be a net plus for the whole network and ecosystem's well-being.\n\nIn my opinion, focusing on the public good would increase the recognition and respect for NounsDAO, which is the best strategy for proliferation.\n\n## Description\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk8iWv2H3.gif)\n\nA lot of good single-board computers are available on the market, and the competition is stiff. However, the purpose of Noun Computers is not to dominate the market or make good profits. It is about a mission to do public good and unite like-minded developers, which will propel the nounish culture and memes. Of course, the key to success is a sustainable model. I believe Noun Computers will be successful because NounsDAO has an amazing culture, a better understanding of community, and connections in the blockchain circles. \n\nI propose the development of Noun Computers, which would run Linux operating system. These computers would be designed specifically for convenient Ethereum stacking, blockchain development, and practical programming learning. By doing so, we can establish a vibrant community of software and hardware developers who will eventually become good supporters and contributors to NounsDAO.\n\nJust imagine, the next thousand ethereum stakers (potential nouners) are mingling somewhere at blockchain conferences at this very moment! A cool gadget like Noun Computer would make for a great conversation starter. It has the potential to attract the attention of numerous high-profile individuals. We will be able to onboard many people to buy our Noun Computers and run Ethereum nodes.\n\n## Noun Computers\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1k5pljSn.png)\n\nNoun Computers will provide affordability, versatility, and the best price/performance/user experience within its category. I will design the Noun Computers from scratch. I majored in electrical engineering and computer science and have experience developing similar computer boards. Noun computers will be perfectly suited for running Ethereum nodes, software/hardware hacking, and teaching programming. \n\nOnce the project is completed, I will deliver PCB designs, blueprints, bill of materials, and estimated costs for mass production. In the future, NounsDAO will have the ability to order large batches of computers at wholesale prices. Additionally, we can develop expansion modules, interesting interfaces, and manufacture nounish cases to further enhance the product line.\n\nIn this project, I will focus on developing state of the art prototypes and estimating manufacturing cost. The limited supply of 50 prototypes will be used to create visibility and promote NounsDAO at conferences.\n\n- A Noun Computer equipped with a 1.5GHz CPU, 8GB RAM, and a 2TB M.2 SSD for running an Ethereum node will cost around $80 to $110.\n- A light version of Noun Computer with less memory can cost as low as $50\n- If there is significant demand and Noun Computers are produced in large quantities (3,000-5,000 units), the manufacturing cost can be further lowered, making Noun Computers a sustainable model for proliferation. The proceeds from sales could then be utilized to manufacture more computers and introduce additional accessories.\n\n## Deliverables\n- Design blueprints, schematics, and a plan for mass production of Noun Computers\n- 50 units of Noun Computer prototypes with aluminum head-crt-bsod case\n    - 10 units - distributed to Nouns' auction winners (starting with the first auction on the opening day of ETH Global NY or Istanbul)\n    - 10 units - showcase and distribute at conferences\n    - 30 units - organize ETH Global Hackathon competition centered around Noun Computers\n\n## Timeline\n**Phase I - Prototyping (4~6 months)**\n- [Jun~Aug 2023] Design and Manufacture Noun-Computer prototypes\n- [Sep or Nov 2023] Bring Noun Computers to ETH Global hackathon and organize hacking competition\n\n## Outsourcing companies\nI have many years of experience working with two great companies KS Technology and Hansaem digitec.\n- KS Technology https://altium.kr/\n- Hansaem digitec https://www.hsdgt.com/main/main.html\n\n## Future opportunities\n- **[Proliferation]** We can **sponsor ETH hackathons** and supply Noun Computers for hardware hackathons. Expansion modules such as camera, NFC, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, and others would open doors for new, fun, and practical blockchain applications. In the long term, we can grow a community of developers around Noun Computers.\n- **[Onboarding]** We can manufacture Noun Computers in large quantities and offer them at affordable prices. By doing so, we could **onboard the Ethereum community** and encourage their contribution to the decentralization of the Ethereum network by **running Ethereum nodes**.\n- **[Public Good]** We can **allocate 20%~30%** of the future supply of Noun Computers to NounsDAO Public Good Fund. Nouners will be able to request computers via an on-chain proposal and send them to **developing countries and minority groups**. Noun Computers can be used to teach practical programming at schools and universities. It is a good way to put resources into the hands of people.\n\n## Person In Charge\nTwitter: [fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)\nHey!

Past Proposal Summary**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HRZT5II.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FKYUjfp.jpg)\n\n### **Prop 176 Recap**\n\nOn December 3rd, we were [funded](https://nouns.wtf/vote/176) of 32.28 ETH ($42K) to build an archive center which stores & display all media contents of Nouns DAO's projects & artworks and all the memes proliferations. It serves as the central repository for storing and displaying all data such as ;\n\n* proposal progress images/videos\n* end product images/videos/links/repo\n* nounish artworks from contents & events\n* cc0 contents & working files\n\nThere is so much great Nouns content scattered across different platforms that went by everyday in our ecosystem. We aim to solve this by providing a central platform where all Nouns-related content all in one place and make it easier for everyone to find it.\n\n**In the past 4 months we have ;**\n\n1. [Archives.wtf](https://archives.wtf/) - built a reliable archive website from the ground up\n2. Built features ; [link to thread](https://twitter.com/thevoadz/status/1641034993798467593?s=20)\n* under any categories, you can search any related data within the page, eg ; **Nouns On-chain Proposal**\n    * prop number\n    * project title\n    * description\n    * builders/artists\n    * category\n* we enable **scroll, filter & search persistence** for better user navigation ( which stored on your device )\n* you can use **cmd+k / ctrl+k** for quick access to search in page\n* cc0 icon & download button\n3.

Project Goals For Upcoming 6 Months**\n\n### **Why should we fund this extension?**\n\n* We want to assist Nouns community, particularly builders and artists, to be able to contribute their project materials and outputs via the platform, which serves as the primary archive centre for the Nouns ecosystem that can be a good reference to others & later generations.\n* It'd be one of the main onboarding tools that keeps track of everything that has occurred in Nouns DAO.\n* We anticipate that the platform will inspire more builders & artists to produce remarkable & high-quality content.\n* We believe that by developing a good proliferation strategies, complementary features & tools that cater the target audience could bring great values, increase targeted KPIs & enhance the product market fit of this project.\n* We will produce profit-oriented products that generates revenue back to the DAO's treasury.\n\n### **Strategy Summary**\n\n1. **Website Enhancement & Features**\n    * **CC0 media page**\n        * pinterest-like\n        * search & filter by type\n        * downloadable\n    * **Community archive submission**\n        * submit project/content outputs\n        * based on category/entirely new\n        * submission history\n    * **Permanent storage media uploader**\n        * free for nounish builders & Nouns-related NFT holders (token-gated)\n        * upload history\n    * **Archivist/builder leaderboard**\n        * gamification\n    * **Feed**\n        * RSS & Atom XML\n        * JSON (Public API)\n\n2. **Proliferation**\n    * **Publications**\n        * kickstart Nouns Archive '23 (sample physical book)\n        * produce monthly Nouns Zine (digital & physical)\n        * convert to profit oriented product\n        * proceeds goes to DAO\n        * quarterly wrap-up report\n    * **Brand Awareness**\n        * prop house round ; Nouns Archive\n        * new feature updates on social media\n        * daily props curation/highlights\n        * ads & campaign (gamified)\n\n3. **Maintenance & Sustainability**\n    * **General website maintenance**\n        * enhance better ui/ux\n    * **Data curation & updates**\n        * data > filter > curate > present\n        * daily updates\n    * **Incentivise submission through leaderboard**\n        * community submission\n\n### **Strategy Details**\n\n**For Website Enhancement & Features ;**\n\n**1. Community archive submission**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EKvVcFO.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zRGCmYR.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kYzeI8v.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AUrMjNR.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1rQXaEQ.png)\n\n* To build **a curated submission form** attached to the website which allows anyone to contribute to the platform.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) and could request to submit a new sub-category and additional contents to their existing proposals/details.\n* The forms will allow users to select their preferred category, status, type of house, round, etc. *(based on specific usage)*\n* User can check their submission history together with submission details *(eg; date, title & status)*\n\n**2. Permanent storage media uploader**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gVzs6Ih.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IoUQQkb.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KFIzROZ.png)\n\n* To improvise an [uploader](https://uploadr.app/) with some new features which we have built for the past few months.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) & it will be token gated focusing on Nouns ecosystem to use it for free ;\n    * Nounders\n    * Nouners\n    * Nounish Builders\n    * Sub DAOs\n    * Nouns' NFT Open Edition Holders / Droposals *(This Is Nouns, The Wizard's Hat etc)*\n* Anyone who has just got noun-pilled into the ecosystem and want to use it, they may choose from any of the available criteria above. This will gradually benefit the Nouns DAO ecosystem over time.\n* User can check their upload history together with the details *(eg; date, title & arweave link)*\n\n**3. Archivist/Contributor Leaderboard**\n\n* We want to create archivist/contributor leaderboard with gamification where top contributors will be incentivised.\n* We will use the fund under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.\n\n**4. Feed**\n\nUtilising a simplified and condensed data feed can be more efficient than navigating through an entire website for the required information, making data feed crucial for individual use cases. That is why we're adding feed as a new feature, to make it easier for you to access the data you need and achieve your goals more efficiently.\n\nWe will provide a few types of feed for the main & sub-category pages ;\n  * RSS feed - /rss.xml\n  * Atom  feed - /atom.xml\n  * JSON feed - /feed.json\n\nThe data we have gathered can be utilised by everyone in the ecosystem for their own unique purposes. For instance, a mini companion app can directly use the JSON feed to list all proposals in NSFW Small Grants.\n\n**For Proliferation Plan ;**\n\n**1. Publications - Nouns Archive '23**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oDnnmMN.png)\n\n* We will produce a yearly curated physical book that features the archive's contents.\n* It would be a completed & working sample physical book which does not include mass production.\n* The prop house round winner's design will be featured as the book's cover. *(more details below)*\n* We will kickstart the pre-production of the book in June 2023.\n* All builders and artists will be contacted to obtain permission to use their works inside the book *(unless CC0)*\n* Anyone who wishes to contribute can do so as we will communicate the deadline for submitting materials.\n* We will make it available for pre-order/mint.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 296 - Nouns Running Club - Fun, Fitness, and Frens",
      "content": "# Nouns Running Club - Fun, Fitness, and Frens\n\n## TL;DR üìù\n\n- The Nouns Running Club aims to counter the partying stereotype of crypto events by focusing on fun, fitness, and FRENship.\n- The club welcomes runners of all skill levels; no NFTs are required üôå.\n- The club will host runs at crypto conferences and local chapter weekly runs üåç.\n- The club's current local chapters span eight countries üá∫üá∏üá≠üá∞üá≤üáæüá©üá¥üá∞üá∑üáπüáºüáØüáµüá®üá¶.\n- **The proposed budget: $52,650.** This supports 11 city chapters (8 existing, 3 new) and 2 major conference runs (EthCC üá´üá∑ + DevConnect üáπüá∑) for the next 6 months.\n\n## Introduction üöÄ\n\n\nEstablished in April 2023, the Nouns Running Club is on a mission to transform the social layer surrounding Nouns and the wider crypto industry.\n\nShifting away from the partying stereotypes, our club aligns with the Nouns ecosystem's values, fostering connections through running and supporting local communities.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ld4THBp.jpg)\n\n## Motivation üí°\n\nThe Nouns Running Club was born out of a desire to challenge the prevailing partying stereotype of crypto events. We recognized the need to start a movement that promotes fun, fitness, and FRENship while showcasing the positive aspects of Nouns.\n\nOur long-term vision includes hosting a major road marathon with Nouns as the title sponsor and host, aiming to create a lasting impact on the industry's perception and proliferation.\n\n## Accomplishments So Far üèÖ\n\nSince its inception in April 2023, the Nouns Running Club has made remarkable strides in achieving its goals of promoting physical fitness, community growth, and social responsibility. Here are some of our key accomplishments:\n\n- Grown to over 120 members on Telegram, with more joining every week üìà.\n- Over a thousand cumulative KMs run by members.\n- Established weekly run leaders in 8 different cities around the world (see below), providing members with the opportunity to participate in regular group runs üåè.\n- Developed a strong brand identity, including a custom t-shirt, a dedicated Telegram chat, and a set of Telegram sticker packs created by [@MochiNFT](https://twitter.com/MochiNFT) on the recommendation of [@0xMaki](https://twitter.com/0xmaki).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ3mJNzSh.png)\n\nThese accomplishments demonstrate the commitment and dedication of the Nouns Running Club. With the support of the wider Nouns DAO community, we aim to continue to grow and make an even greater impact.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk6fJVzBh.png)\n\n## Proliferation üìà\n\nHow does the Nouns Running Club promote proliferation of Nouns and Nounish-ness?\n\nOne of the major hurdles üöß to proliferation is the difficulty of introducing Nouns to people outside of crypto. However, we can jump over that hurdle by welcoming anyone, regardless of running ability, promoting the Nounish values of collaboration, diversity, and open participation.\n\nYou don't even need to hold NFTs or know what crypto is. If you can move from point A to B, you're invited! üèÉüí®\n\nWearing our custom Nouns Running Club gear, we act as moving billboards, promoting Nouns to onlookers and fellow runners. Our events create opportunities for people to interact with the Nouns community in a fun, informal, and healthy context.\n\nOur goal is to reshape the social layer and showcase the positivity of Nouns to a wider audience.\n\n## Activities üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nThe Nouns Running Club will engage in two types of activities: Special Event Runs at Crypto Conferences and Local Chapter Weekly Runs. Both are key to our plan for growth and proliferation.\n\nThese are usually ~5km runs targeted towards beginners to run at a leisurely pace. We have a culture of \"No one left behind!\", which means we will always ensure that everyone is taken care of regardless of their pace.\n\nIn fact, it's in our motto:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryEWrNzr2.png)\n\n### Special Event Runs at Crypto Conferences üéüÔ∏è\n\nBy doing special runs as a side-event to conferences, we can penetrate a much bigger audience as people from around the world fly in to attend these conferences. This has been proven by our genesis event in ETHGlobal Tokyo, which spawned the Tokyo, Taipei, Hong Kong, and Seoul chapters. See testimonials below!\n\n#### EthCC (Paris üá´üá∑) - July 17, 2023\n\nEthCC is the largest annual Ethereum event in Europe. Not only that, it is also a non-profit event by the local Ethereum community. Very Nounish! Owing to the fact that we do not currently have any local chapters in Europe, we hope this activation will allow us to grow some local chapters in the European region.\n\n#### DevConnect (Istanbul üáπüá∑) - November 13, 2023\n\nSince DevCon has been postponed, this will be the premier Ethereum event of the year. The location of Istanbul will also attract many attendees from all over Europe, and we believe that this will help bootstrap multiple European chapters as well.\n\n### Local Chapter Weekly Runs üåç\n\nEach local chapter has its own run leaders who organize and guide weekly runs. These leaders serve as ambassadors of Nounish-ness in their respective localities, promoting the values of Nouns DAO and encouraging more people to join the ecosystem.\n\nBy integrating physical fitness with community engagement, we aim to create a unique, fun, and rewarding experience for all members of the community.\n\nCurrently, we have local chapters in the following cities:\n\n- Denver üá∫üá∏ led by [@jp4g_](https://twitter.com/jp4g_)\n- Hong Kong üá≠üá∞ led by [@Natalielpy](https://twitter.com/Natalielpy)\n- Kuala Lumpur üá≤üáæ led by [@motypes](https://twitter.com/motypes)\n- Santo Domingo üá©üá¥ led by [@necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas)\n- Seoul üá∞üá∑ led by [@colorchipeth](https://twitter.com/colorchipeth)\n- Taipei üáπüáº led by [@AkiraWuc](https://twitter.com/AkiraWuc)\n- Tokyo üáØüáµ led by [@shutollen](https://twitter.com/shutollen)\n- Vancouver üá®üá¶ led by [@adrianmcli](https://twitter.com/adrianmcli)\n\nWith the help of this proposal, we hope to expand to at least three more cities within the next 6 months, with a particular focus in the European region.\n\n## Budget üí∞\n\nThe following is a rough estimate of the costs required for running the club for the next 6 months. The primary purpose of the funds is to enhance the experience of our club events to attract more newcomers and proliferate Nouns further into the world.\n\n### **1. Special Event Runs at Crypto Conferences**\n\n**1.1 ETHCC (Paris) & 1.2 DevConnect (Istanbul)**\n\n- Customized Local Logo Design: $1,000\n- Dry-Fit Running T-Shirts (30 units at $35 each): $1,050\n- Discretionary Fund: $2,000\n\n**Subtotal for Special Event Runs ($4,050 x 2): $8,100**\n\n### **2. Regular Operations at Local Chapter Weekly Runs**\n\n*(Estimated budget remains consistent across chapters)*\n\n**2.1 to 2.8: Tokyo üáØüáµ, Seoul üá∞üá∑, Taipei üáπüáº, Vancouver üá®üá¶, Hong Kong üá≠üá∞, Denver üá∫üá∏, Kuala Lumpur üá≤üáæ, Santo Domingo üá©üá¥**\n\n- Customized Local Logo Design: $1,000\n- Dry-Fit Running T-Shirts (30 units at $35 each): $1,050\n- Discretionary Fund: $2,000\n\n**Subtotal for Local Chapter Weekly Runs ($4,050 x 8): $32,400**\n\n### **3. Expansion to Three Additional Cities**\n\n- Customized Local Logo Design: $1,000\n- Dry-Fit Running T-Shirts (30 units at $35 each): $1,050\n- Discretionary Fund: $2,000\n\n**Subtotal for Expansion to New Cities ($4,050 x 3): $12,150**\n\n### **4. Breakdown of Discretionary Spending**\n\nEach Discretionary Fund, amounting to $2,000 per city, is intended to enhance the overall running club experience and ensure smooth operations. It can be allocated as follows:\n\n- Promotional Materials (stickers, flyers): $200\n- Additional Swag (e.g., water bottles, towels, headbands): $500\n- Monthly Post-Run Gatherings (estimated $100 per gathering): $600\n- Online Collaborative Tools (Notion Plus, Google Workspace, etc.): $200\n- Contingency Reserve (for unexpected expenses): $500\n\n### **Total Estimated Budget: $52,650**\n\nThe budget proposal accounts for a cost of **approximately $4,050 per city or event for the next 6 months**. This total reflects the Nouns Running Club's extensive and committed network of volunteers in eight different countries, each hosting regular runs and contributing to the vibrant global community.\n\n## Leadership üëë\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyzH-INS3.png)\n\nThe leadership team consists of 8 individuals spread across 8 countries, each running their local Nouns Running Club chapter. One of them is [@adrianmcli](https://twitter.com/adrianmcli), the holder of two Nouns (#261 and #449). The funds will be controlled by a 3/8 multisig, all whom are local chapter leaders:\n\n**Multisig address (3/8)**: [0x2a67269a3302868490dEFB7fF1b72D8489CE4E6a](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x2a67269a3302868490dEFB7fF1b72D8489CE4E6a)\n\n**Signers:**\n- [@adrianmcli](https://twitter.com/adrianmcli): [0xE7304bA0f157f2Ade94015934284b6704BC72911](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe7304ba0f157f2ade94015934284b6704bc72911)\n- [@AkiraWuc](https://twitter.com/AkiraWuc): [0xca84541D8B8Bf50fd8b042aCFd28B1e390703E20](https://etherscan.io/address/0xca84541D8B8Bf50fd8b042aCFd28B1e390703E20)\n- [@colorchipeth](https://twitter.com/colorchipeth): [0x04bec7F54595f418d7E37A09cD21dcAF4c1Ca815](https://etherscan.io/address/0x04bec7F54595f418d7E37A09cD21dcAF4c1Ca815)\n- [@jp4g_](https://twitter.com/jp4g_): [0x7434672e89b055fd02deebeF203738cF0802C01b](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7434672e89b055fd02deebeF203738cF0802C01b)\n- [@motypes](https://twitter.com/motypes): [0x2675A89c7AFC000c9b6Ae838660553Ff5f586356](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2675A89c7AFC000c9b6Ae838660553Ff5f586356)\n- [@Natalielpy](https://twitter.com/Natalielpy): [0x32e9507cb51D884b71BF6E99fc878CEf30Ef72e7](https://etherscan.io/address/0x32e9507cb51D884b71BF6E99fc878CEf30Ef72e7)\n- [@necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas): [0x1db19B9903c5510AA5a866ea643Eb021CD12Bda0](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1db19B9903c5510AA5a866ea643Eb021CD12Bda0)\n- [@shutollen](https://twitter.com/shutollen): [0xc84A3C32993608A85DCa24cb4A54e3EA298303A8](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc84A3C32993608A85DCa24cb4A54e3EA298303A8)\n\nYou may also notice that the Nouns Running Club [multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x2a67269a3302868490dEFB7fF1b72D8489CE4E6a) holds a number of NFTs:\n\n- [NounsRC.eth](https://app.ens.domains/nounsrc.eth) (registered for 5 years)\n- [NounsRunningClub.eth](https://app.ens.domains/nounsrunningclub.eth) (registered for 5 years)\n- Lil Noun [#7682](https://etherscan.io/nft/0x4b10701Bfd7BFEdc47d50562b76b436fbB5BdB3B/7682)\n- Gnar [#4241](https://etherscan.io/nft/0x558BFFF0D583416f7C4e380625c7865821b8E95C/4241)\n\nThis demonstrates our commitment to reaching out to other Nouns-inspired ecosystems and solidifying the club as a long-term endeavour.\n\n## Testimonials üí¨\n\n> \"During my time at ETH Tokyo, I attended numerous informative side events, all following a similar format of renting out a nice cafe or club, promoting networking, and featuring a speaker. Among them, \"Let's run together and create a healthy crypto culture!üí™\" caught my attention due to my passion for exercise, so I immediately signed up. It proved to be a refreshing and much-needed event. Running amidst the beautiful Tokyo scenery, I bonded with fellow crypto industry acquaintances who shared a similar interest in fitness, allowing me to make friends quickly. Additionally, receiving a delightful printed t-shirt added to my happiness. Recognizing that I couldn't continue this running event upon returning to Seoul, I took the initiative to become the lead organizer and gather individuals for running sessions in my city.\"\n\n‚Äî [@colorchipeth](https://twitter.com/colorchipeth), Seoul Chapter Leader, Nouns Running Club\n\n> \"In the beginning of my first 5k run with Nouns Running Club, I was nervous because everyone else seemed to be much more experienced in running, but this feeling completely went away as the founder of the club, Adrian, stayed back and kept pace with me all the time. \n> \n> But what made me even more touched is what happened next. As we approached the 4km mark, the rest of the group, who had already completed the run, turned back and rejoined us. We were both very surprised and asked them why they came back. Akira, our Taipei Club leader, replied us with a warm smile, \"Of course we come back, we are a club.\" And another member (Jack, Denver chapter leader) also smiled and said to us \"No one left behind.\" In the end, we finished our 5k together as a united team. \n> \n> Thanks to this experience and the whole group, I started to like running and run with the club whenever I have time. And I hope that more people could experience what I have experienced. This club is not only about running, it's also about togetherness, care, and the pure kindness between people.\"\n\n‚Äî Sydney, Taipei Chapter Member, Nouns Running Club\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ_OgVfHh.png)\n\n## Conclusion üéØ\n\nIn conclusion, the Nouns DAO Running Club represents a unique amalgamation of health, community, and social responsibility. We believe in the transformative power of running and its ability to bring individuals together, fostering a sense of community and shared purpose.\n\nWe aim to challenge stereotypes, promote a healthy lifestyle, and cultivate a strong, vibrant community within the Nouns ecosystem. We are dedicated to creating a lasting impact that goes beyond the crypto industry, and with your support, we are confident that we can make this vision a reality.\n\nSupport us in our mission!

      "content": "# üáßüá∑ NFT.Brasil - Taking Over S√£o Paulo and Celebrating the Brazilian Community 2\n\n \n## Re-submission disclaimer\n\n---\n\n\nThe NounsBR team remains committed to delivering an exceptional encounter with NFT.Brasil. To achieve this, we have made adaptations to Proposal 285 based on two key considerations:\n\n - Addressing community requests: We have carefully taken into account the feedback and incorporated changes accordingly.\n\n - Working within time constraints: We have evaluated what is feasible within the given timeframe and made adjustments.\n\n#### Key Changes and Focus Areas:\n\n - We already sent the sponsors to the first wave of Eletromidia 00H activation. We still have time to phase 2 and 3 of this activation described in [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JMDP9eevh8a1D7aK3_ZCxQjjTjs2rFufTX09WOiWkt4/edit?usp=sharing).\nThat includes 78 airport screens, 41 commercial buildings spots with 405 screens and more. Over 1 million impressions, we expect great outcomes from this activation)   \n\n - Lower the Metaverse Activation: After considering community feedback, we have decided to lower the Metaverse Activation from the proposal.*\n\n -  Scaling down the lounge to a booth: In response to community feedback on the sponsorship price, we have transformed the lounge into a booth. Additionally, we have adjusted the sponsorship package to align with the revised offering.**\n\n - Collaboration with Aubtoshi for merchandise: Instead of producing our own merchandise, we have decided to collaborate with Aubtoshis and feature their pre-made merchandise.\n\nBy incorporating these changes the proposal addresses community's concerns while still delivering an extraordinary event experience fulfilling the Nouns community expectations. \n\n**OBS***:Nouns building token, Noggles and Some 3D avatars will be airdroped to the community, its done anyways we gotta use it :) \n\n**OBS****: Instead of having 3 people taking care of the Lounge we are going to create booth shifts and also reduce the costs with personal\n\n\n---\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cNvhtov.png)\n\n## TL:DR \n\nNouns leads the NFT movement in Brazil thanks to its community, but we are just getting started. We are proposing a huge Sao Paulo city takeover starting in NFT.Brasil event.\n\nOur goal is to achieve a massive and innovative onboarding experience for all attendees, and to do so, we will be present in five strategic areas throughout the event journey. These include the NFT Exhibition, Speaker Sessions, Booth, Metaverse, and Street Gallery ([Eletromedia](https://eletromidia.com.br/) OOH advertising). \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3CH4aRq.png)\n\nNFT.Brasil is a pioneering conference celebrating the cutting-edge advancements and possibilities of the NFT world that is set to take place in Sao Paulo city, **Brazil on June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, 2023.**\n\nNFT.Brasil is performed by the same organizers of [NFT.Rio](https://nftrio.io/), Nouns Community builders (the same people behind Proposals [#142](https://nouns.wtf/vote/142), [#118](https://nouns.wtf/vote/118)   [#98](https://nouns.wtf/vote/98)) in partnership with [MAAC Hub](https://www.instagram.com/maac.hub/). \n\nBuilders: \n\n- [Bob Burnquist ](https://twitter.com/bobburnquist)\n- [Vlad (sktbrd.eth)](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/user/0x41cb654d1f47913acab158a8199191d160dabe4a)\n- [Guiriba](https://twitter.com/guiribabrb) \n- [JP.‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® ](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp)\n- [Ilustradora](https://twitter.com/ilustradoraeth)\n- [Debinvest](https://twitter.com/debinvest) \n- [TheSmith](https://twitter.com/akathesmith) \n- [Fabio Ema](https://twitter.com/FabioEmaArt)  \n- [Lcsant](https://twitter.com/lcsant_eth)\n- [MarcosX.eth](https://www.instagram.com/maac.hub/)\n\n\nWe want to bring Nouns to NFT.Brasil. The event is expected to attract over 30,000 individuals. The venue is the iconic Bienal, which is a true masterpiece of contemporary design, and is a premier cultural destination in Brazil.\n\n## The Brazilian Genesis\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P10GPfy.jpg)\n\n[click here to open](https://i.imgur.com/TfWFIsY.jpeg)\n\n## What is NFT.Brasil?\n\nGet ready to witness an exciting fusion of art, technology, business, networking and innovation at NFT.Brasil, a pioneering conference that is all set to take place at Bienal, an iconic venue in heart of Sao Paulo. The event promises to be a one-of-a-kind experience that brings together digital artists, web3 builders, art enthusiasts, business leaders from outside Web3 to learn and connect new opportunities.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WS14MiW.gif)\n\nThe mockup video gives you a sneak peek of what's to come: [click here to watch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCPjVRjLDA)\n\nBienal was designed by the legendary Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and was first opened in 1951 to host the S√£o Paulo Art Bienal, which is one of the world's most prestigious art exhibitions. \n\nHosting NFT.Brasil conference at the Bienal is a jump from traditional events and a testament to the venue's reputation as a premier cultural destination, and it promises to be an ideal setting for the fusion of art and technology that is at the heart of the NFT movement.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0gS9Ksp.jpg)\n\nThe event is June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th and will be divided into two areas. The NFT exhibition will showcase Brazilian and international artists, collections, projects, and DAOs. The second area will host talks and lectures, bringing the community together to discuss the technology and its impact on our present and future. With a combination of NFT art exhibitions and speaker sessions, the event expects to attract over 30,000 individuals seeking knowledge, connections, and business opportunities in the field. S√£o Paulo is one of the largest and most vibrant cities in the world, making it the perfect backdrop for this exciting event. \n\n## What does Nouns gets by funding this proposal?\n\nBesides being a huge celebration of the Nouns community in Brazil and what we've been building for 9 months after NFT.Rio, and also being a great chance to bring new people on board, Nouns DAO will get:\n\n### Open-air NFT exhibition - [Eletromedia](https://eletromidia.com.br/)\n\nFor 20 days, NFT.Brasil will host the largest open-air NFT exhibition in the world. In partnership with Eletromedia, Brazil's leading Out of Home media company, NFT.Brasil will showcase artists' works  throughout the cities of S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, and Fortaleza. \n\nWe want Nouns to be a part of this activation. **Last year at NFT.Rio, the OOH media led the Nouns 367 sale bought by Sanuxo for 113.22 ETH.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HrGlQ5F.jpg)\n\nThe proposed package for this proposal aims 13 days of insertions in strategic points over the city of S√£o Paulo, described as follows:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/mTmBjNZ/nounify-1.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gtsn3ig.jpg)\n\nS√£o Paulo is a global city, it's Brazil's highest GDP and the 10th largest in the world with a over 12 million residents. See bellow the distribution of Eletromidia Presence in Sao Paulo\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ydOnnUg.jpg)\n\n\n\n### Nouns Booth\n\n## This would be the new booth position and we are keeping the nounish activations below.\n\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/nR0rS90/nounify.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BlLWPOD.png)\n\n\n### Metaverse (We kept this here cause we are still doing metaverse stuff and what is done will not be undone) \n\nNFT.Brasil is created a metaverse in either Cryptovoxels and Spatial, designed by the talented metarchitect Fabio Ema. During the four-day IRL event, everything will be broadcasted there. After that, the NFT.Brasil team will keep it active for three months with online events, and the community will be able to use it as they see fit, forever. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6cJJdRG.gif)\n\nMake sure to watch the [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FfSsVZsFZM)!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LQ8o9JA.jpg)\n\n\nWhen we say take over S√£o Paulo, we mean it. After prop 142 lots of relevant unpredictable things happen. In a meeting with Bob Burnquist the **S√£o Paulo MAYOR** got nounified when checking NFT.Brasil Metaverse for the first time using SkateCuida institute VR headset üëá (not to mention [random TV exposure](https://skatehive.app/hive-173115/@xvlad/rucfdpzf)) \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/hZksJkY/ezgif-com-crop.gif)\n\n\n### Main Stage\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dRT2vCC.jpg)\n\n\nAubtoshi is an exciting addition to the lineup of main stage speakers at the upcoming NFT.Brasil event. As a highly influential figure in the Nouns community, Aubtoshi's presentation is sure to be a highlight of the event. Her expertise and experience within the Nouns ecosystem will provide valuable insights for attendees, while her engaging speaking style and natural charisma are sure to captivate the audience. \n\nWe'll also have a builders panel with Nouns BR members such as JP, Guiriba, Debussy, Vlad and others. They will tell  their stories within the ecosystem and invite the audience to join the Nouns community.\n\n### NFT.Brasil Exhibition\n\nNFT.Brasil is excited to announce that the upcoming exhibition will feature an exclusive art display by Nouns, alongside other highly respected collections such as Crypto Punks, Doodles and of course innovative navite brazilian collections. As one of the featured collections, Nouns will have a prominent position in the exhibition, offering visitors a chance to explore the ecosystem and engage with Nouns team. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uVh9ccj.png)\n\n**Building community, Every Day, Forever**\n\nThis event is not only a celebration of our achievements so far, but also a unique opportunity to showcase Nouns brand to millions of people across Brazil's largest cities for several weeks. As the biggest NFT event in the country, we have the chance to onboard thousands of new community members and take Nouns community in Brazil to the next level.\n\nNFT.Brasil is going to bring more than 5,000 students from public schools with a unique 3-day opportunity to explore the world of digital art. This event not only offers a chance to appreciate the beauty of this art form but also serves as a platform for driving social impact and fostering community development. Alongside Skate Cuida, G10 Favelas, a group of  social impact leaders and entrepreneurs from the Favelas, plays a vital role in this initiative. \n\n## *\"THE REASON IS THE CAUSE AND THE CAUSE IS TO ADVANCE BRASIL IN FUTURE TECHNOLOGY\"*\n> Bob Burnquist\n\n## Budget Breakout in USDC \n\n### - **NFT.Brasil Sponsorship**\n\n- Sponsorship Package - $ 15.000,00 (-5k negotiated discount for ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® only ) \n    - 13 passports and 40 expo tickets for 3-day event access (raffled off to the Brazilian community)\n    - Main stage speaker (Aubtoshi)\n    - Brand exposure on social media and website\n    - Brand exposure within the event\n    - 5m¬≤ booth space\n    ![](https://i.ibb.co/JBsWxYN/image.png)\n\n\n- Street Galery - $ 20.000,00 \n    - Eletromedia (OOH media in S√£o Paulo)\n    - 13 days, NFT.Brasil will host the largest open-air NFT exhibition in the world\n    - [Over 1 Million ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® impressions](https://eletromidia.com.br/) .\n    - Big Surprise\n\n\n### - **Nouns Activation**\n\n- Booth Construction and Nounification Costs - $ 1.680,00\n    - 3 days rental\n        - 2 TVS + Stands $ 500,00\n        - BackDrop $ 250,00\n        - Booth mobilia (Balcony, chairs, puff)  $ 580,00\n        - Nouns Decoration (Wall Stickers and Fabric) $ 350,00\n\n\n- Booth activation during the 3-day event - During the three-day event, three members of Nouns BR will be shifting in the booth, being entirely dedicated to onboarding new users.

At time of writing ~0.8eth remains, which implies an ongoing cost to the DAO of 1.6 eth per month.\n\nAs the DAO continues to grow, with more voters and more proposals, it is likely that the rate at which the voteRefund balance is depleted will also increase.\n\nI propose we top up the contract with another 15 eth.\n\n\n---\n\n**Recap of how this feature works:**\n- Vote with Gas Refund allow Nouners and delegates to vote and receive a gas refund.\n- Refunds are subject to certain constraints:\n    - Gas base fee is capped at 200 gwei.\n    - Gas priority fee is capped at 2 gwei.\n    - Total gas is capped at 200K, supporting voting reason text up to roughly 9,190 characters.\n    - If the contract‚Äôs balance is insufficient, voter will receive a partial refund.\n- This feature requires the DAO to maintain the DAO contract‚Äôs ETH balance, which should be done via periodic ETH transfer proposals from the treasury to the DAO contract (this proposal performs the first funding).\n- The DAO can choose to withdraw refund ETH back into the treasury at any time via a proposal.\n\nInitially implemented and funded here:\nhttps://nouns.wtf/vote/152",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 291 - Nouns Stream Proposal: Payments infrastructure public good by Nouns DAO",
      "content": "# Nouns Stream Proposal: Payments infrastructure public good by Nouns DAO\n\n# tl;dr\n\n[Nouns Stream](https://www.nouns.stream) is a public good for payments across Noun-ish DAOs and beyond. It is an open-source, free, permission-less protocol that enables **Phased (milestone-based) or Periodic (recurring)** **payments**. This public good can support various payment modes, including peer-to-peer, DAO-to-DAO, community rounds, and grants without complex setup, shadow tokens, or intermediary protocol fees.\n\nNouns Stream does more than further the Nouns‚Äô visual brand/meme; it helps push the ecosystem forward with easy-to-use public goods. This protocol has already been [audited by 0xMacro](https://0xmacro.com/library/audits/nouns-stream-1.html) and deployed across Ethereum ([Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB13Afc4f39942b885A00A60A02295016BF82d447#code), [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05#code)), Arbitrum ([Mainnet](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), Goerli), Optimism ([Mainnet](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), Goerli), Polygon ([Mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05), [Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05)) and Base ([Goerli](https://goerli.basescan.org/address/0xb6E0407F0094816a67b7d6E2FA27a87be9396f05)).\n\nThe protocol developers, who are also Nouns‚Äô holders, are asking for a retroactive grant of **16 eth** to cover the cost of the audit (US$25,000 ie ~14 eth) and deployment (US$5,000 ie ~2 eth).\n\n![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/9g5l0ZE.png)\n\n# Problem\n\nNouns and Noun-ish DAOs have no recourse or control over outgoing funds due to a successful proposal. If a team fails to deliver or meet certain milestones, the community cannot vote to recall the remaining funds.\n\nMoreover, contributors to longer-running, phased projects need more certainty. Today they are forced to make a single, big ask for funding or create multiple proposals over the life of their project to secure continued funding. Unfortunately, such uncertainty doesn‚Äôt help set up ambitious developers, artists, and creators for success.\n\nLastly, as the community evolves, it may pay specific contributors‚Äî e.g., IRL Events Coordinator ‚Äî a fixed amount per quarter, paid bi-weekly.\n\nWithin the community, we have seen a healthy debate between funding experiments to further the meme while keeping treasury spending in check. Tooling like Nouns Stream helps balance where milestone-based payments can commit to experiments and revert (via Proposal) if a project is not delivering the promised objectives.\n\n# Proposal\n\nThe Nouns Stream protocol is open-source, free, and permissionless. It allows anyone to set up an escrow account that is funded with funds later disbursed via one of two modes:\n\n1. Phased (i.e., milestone-based)\n2. Periodic (i.e., regular intervals)\n\nTo further clarify and formally define:\n\n1. **Phased:** these are milestone-based payments where the funds are set up to be disbursed in predefined amounts on fixed dates. The dates and amounts for each milestone are set up during contract deployment. Configuring payment amounts on a milestone basis allows for unique cases requiring larger upfront payments to bootstrap projects. For example, a proposal for 75 eth might be broken into four parts over some fixed dates like:\n    1. 04-10-2023: 35 eth\n    2. 04-20-2023: 5 eth\n    3. 04-30-2023: 15 eth\n    4. 05-15-2023: 20 eth\n2. **Periodic:** these are recurring payouts at fixed intervals defined in days or weeks. For example, a proposal could be set up to pay a community contributor 24 eth for the next three months (12 weeks) at two-week intervals, i.e., they will get paid 4 eth every two weeks from the escrow.\n\nThe Controller/Sender (e.g. Nouns Governor‚Äôs Contract in the case of Nouns DAO) is the only party that can cancel the escrow and recalls funds. The Receiver can‚Äôt withdraw funds before said strike dates. Such controls allow the community to create follow-up proposals and recall funds if a project is not believed to deliver on its promise long-term.\n\nThe protocol has a tipping mechanism where payments will be pushed to the receiving address if the payout is set up with a tip incentive. This avoids the need for Receiver to claim/withdraw funds. If no tip percentage is defined during contract deployment, the Receiver has to withdraw funds as they become available manually. Today, the tips are hard-coded to go to a fixed address. The developers will release an update within a few weeks where anyone who helps run these transactions can trigger transactions and earn tips.\n\nWith predictable payout timelines, Nouns Square can hold regular Demo Day sessions for projects to share progress against milestones üëÄ\n\nSome previous proposals that could‚Äôve directly benefited from the proposed payment infrastructure include:\n\n- [Fund design, engineering, and community contributors](https://nouns.wtf/vote/17)\n- [Prop House Protocol: Public Infrastructure by Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)\n- [Nounish Dataverse, open source data](https://nouns.wtf/vote/240)\n- [Nouns Deli Melbourne: Piloting a Nounish Franchise Model](https://nouns.wtf/vote/254)\n\nNouns Stream distinguishes from existing protocols such as Juicebox and Sablier through focused features, better user experience and Nounish visual branding:\n\n1. It is visually propagating the Nouns meme\n2. Providing a point-and-click user experience that any proposer can use to set up an escrow\n3. Leverages CREATE2 opcode to provide future contract address, thus eliminating the need to pre-emptively deploy contracts or setup streams before Proposal has passed\n4. Phased payment unlocks on pre-determined milestone dates\n5. Capability to setup different payment amount for each phase within project\n6. Zero fees, forever, and low gas\n7. No secondary token to swap and manage\n8. Sender/Controller fully controls the funds, i.e., DAO or multi-sig, who adds funds to the deployed contract\n\n# Deliverables & Ask\n\nEverything has been built as open source and under the GPL license. The deliverables include a developer (React) SDK, allowing other developers to under this infrastructure within their applications. In addition, 0xMacro has [audited](https://0xmacro.com/library/audits/nouns-stream-1.html) the project.\n\n**The total ask for this project is 16 eth.**\n\nThis funding will help the developers (retroactively) cover:\n\n- cost of the audit completed by 0xMacro (US$25,000 ie ~14 eth)\n- cost of contract deployment across all networks (US$5,000 ie ~2 eth)\n\nIn the future, the developers want to extend Nouns Build and add these payout options natively (via pull request) to the project. However, this Proposal doesn‚Äôt ask for funding for any such future development:\n\n![Untitled](https://i.imgur.com/3OVz9Ll.png)\n\n# Contributors\n\nMatthew (evav.eth, Noun#604, LilNoun#5834+5, Builder#67, Gnar#3750): 5+ years as blockchain engineer who has worked on various protocols including [Burrata.xyz](http://Burrata.xyz).\n\nOsama (osama.eth, osamakhan.eth, Noun#463, LilNoun#5703, Builder#54, Gnar#553): 2+ years blockchain product/engineering and has helped build [OlympusDAO.finance](http://OlympusDAO.finance) and [Burrata.xyz](http://Burrata.xyz). \n\nOsama and Matthew have also been involved in the founding of Purple DAO ‚Äî flagship Nouns Build DAO based around the Farcaster network.",

      "content": "# Nouns Chinese Socials: 6 Month Pilot\n\n### TLDR;\n- Funding [SCG Group](https://scg.red), a digital agency with the goal to empower digital Chinese communities to learn about and actively contribute to the broader Nouns ecosystem.\n- Multi-platform (RED, Douyin, Weibo) Social Media Campaign for Nouns DAO in China\n- 5+ posts per week on each of the 3 platforms focusing on translation and remixing of images & short-form videos from other platforms\n- Oni traveling to China offering guidance and support to the local team, sourcing content and ensuring that our marketing endeavors remain nounish and in line with the global nouns community.\n- 63 ETH streamed over 6 month period\n\n\n**Long Term Vision**: Building a meaningful and long-lasting Nounish community in China poses a challenging yet exciting opportunity for the DAO. Our goal is to make Nouns a highly recognizable brand among Chinese-speaking individuals and to inspire ambitious builders within this community to engage with the Protocol.\n\n**Objectives**:\n1. Introduce Nouns DAO to Chinese-speaking individuals interested in web3, serving as their gateway to the space.\n2. Offer a comprehensive understanding of Nouns to Chinese-speaking individuals curious about its concept.\n3. Facilitate the integration of new Chinese builders, inspiring and connecting them with existing builders to generate ambitious and impactful proposals.\n4. Highlight funded projects and empower the Chinese community to share our content and narrative within their own networks.\n5. Empower builders to leverage our content for seamless interactions with Chinese brands and non-crypto organizations.\n\n**Opportunity:**\nAs the world‚Äôs most populous country, boasting over 1.4 billion people, China offers a vast potential market for Nouns. The nation‚Äôs more than 1 billion active internet users and over 1.2 billion mobile phone users further amplify the tremendous opportunities available.\n\nWe feel distribution of existing content is a huge opportunity within the DAO. Our ambition is to continue to proliferate the meme throughout this expansive territory. The recent decision by the DAO to fund a series of activations across China has provided the perfect springboard for our efforts. We intend to build on this momentum by launching a comprehensive, multi-platform social media campaign, leveraging local marketing expertise to cultivate a significant and enduring Nounish community within the country.\n\n![CN Digital Population](https://i.imgur.com/F4MEB9h.png)\n\n**Strategy:**\nIt is crucial to acknowledge that China‚Äôs digital landscape is distinctly unique, as most Chinese internet users lack access to western online content. The nation boasts various platforms and services exclusive to its market. We understand that customizing our marketing and outreach initiatives to cater different segments of the Chinese market is vital. As such, we aim to meticulously consider cultural subtleties, regulations, preferences, and values of Chinese internet users in order to adapt our strategy effectively.\n\nGiven the vast expanse of China and the diverse demographics that Nouns can resonate with, it is essential to involve numerous content creators and create tailored content streams for this region. To accomplish this, Oni intends to visit China during the pilot phase, collaborating directly with SCG's team on the ground and immersing himself in the local culture and web3/art communities. We are confident that our multi-platform strategy, combined with in-depth marketing knowledge of the market, will enable us to successfully attain this objective.\n\n## SCG Group\nOur expertise lies in helping brands penetrate the Chinese market and expand their footprint. With more than a decade of experience introducing international brands and artists to China, we leverage our profound understanding of both Chinese and Western cultures, as well as slang and trends, to drive consistent and organic growth. To date, we have amassed over 27 million followers for Western brands and artists in China.\n\nAt SCG Group, we meticulously select our partners, much like how the Nouns community carefully reviews and votes for each prop. This is mainly due to the significant amount of human resources we invest in tailoring plans for each project.\n\nNevertheless, Nouns immediately captured our attention due to its unique blend of technology, branding, and collective community experimentation. We admire the art, the permissionless approach to IP, and we aspire to play a pivotal role in facilitating China‚Äôs integration into the global Nouns community. \n\n\n\n[![Nouns x SCG](https://i.imgur.com/UBoq5Dw.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUo2ljQmILQ) \n[Nouns x SCG in Time Square, New York City ‚Äì February 26 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUo2ljQmILQ) \n*While visiting New York City earlier this year, SCG took the opportunity to create a fun video for placement on billboard in Times Square, highlighting a clip from The Wizard's Hat -- a recently funded nounish animated short.*\n\n## Core Team\n**Gedoumaru**: Founder & Managing Director of SCG\n![Gedoumaru](https://i.imgur.com/JgbmoQ6.jpg)\nWith over a decade of experience in driving growth for visionary brands and individuals across diverse markets, both in the East and the West, Gedoumaru has developed a unique set of skills that combines 1-on-1 guidance, strategic digital approach, and localized creative direction to help clients achieve significant and impactful growth.\n\nGedoumaru brings a unique and invaluable perspective to the team as she seamlessly bridges Eastern and Western cultures.

This remarkable growth can be attributed to our effective use of the #GlassAnimals hashtag\n* 2020 Jan: 1,383,000\n* 2022 Sep: 25,363,000\n\n\n[LoverFella x Glass Animals Minecraft Gaming Activation](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lko48mx7k6loe4x/AAA9e5fdHEl4ite10E6V1U8Ma?preview=VID.mp4)\n[![LoverFella x Glass Animals](https://i.imgur.com/19Xfxs5.png)](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lko48mx7k6loe4x/AAA9e5fdHEl4ite10E6V1U8Ma?preview=VID.mp4) \n\n\n\n\n\n**Jonas Blue**\n![Jonas Blue1](https://i.imgur.com/z3lRzef.png)\n\nTo help artists break through and increase their visibility in China, SCG always takes the initiative to carefully curate and recreate content that specifically caters to the Chinese audience's preferences.\n\nSCG built Jonas Blue's digital profile in China from scratch. One of the earliest posts we made was a live clip of his song \"By Your Side,\" which garnered an impressive 2.1M streams, 154,000 likes, 2,618 comments, and 1,787 reposts organically. In just one month, he gained over 40,000 followers on his Chinese social media accounts.\n\n![Jonas Blue2](https://i.imgur.com/92eH7TN.png)\n\n![Jonas Blue3](https://i.imgur.com/ZttoJjE.png)\n\nAfter collaborating with SCG for about 6 months, there has been a surge in traffic and heightened artist awareness for Jonas Blue in China. As a result, Chinese people have taken an interest in Jonas Blue and his work. Many content creators and influencers on social media platforms have spontaneously started recording and posting videos using his other songs, which has led to a couple of his other songs besides ‚ÄúBy Your Side‚Äù going viral in China.\n\nFor example, more than 4,000 Douyin users have joined the \"Mama Challenge\" initiated by SCG under Jonas Blue's accounts.

Content Proliferation & Total Reach**\n  -  Number of **proliferation instances** of our content is leveraged by others (e.g. KTLA using our content as b-roll)\n  -  **Total Reach** - how many people saw our content\n  \t  -  **Why this metric?**  \n  \t  \t\t-  This contains both our own reach, and reach by content proliferation.\n  \t  \t\t-  This is a proxy for the usefulness & quality of our content.\n  \t  \t\t-  It will lead us to making our content as accessible and re-usable as possible.\n  -  **Season 2 Goals:** \n  \t\t-  200 Instances of proliferation (vs. 50 in season 1)\n  \t\t-  5M Reach (vs. 3.75M in season 1)\n  \t\n**2. Social Media Followers** \n  -  Total followers on @nounish social media accounts\n  \t\t-   **Why this metric?** \n  \t\t\t-   This represents affinity with our content and is a proxy to our success as a \"voice of the Nouns brand\"\n-   **Season 2 Goals:**\n\t\t-   16,000 followers (2x)\n**3. Minutes of content published**\n* **Why this metric?**\n\t* During Season 1 we learned that having a constraint of the type of video we commit to make (e.g. short form or long form) is inefficient\n\t* We think our high quality content minutes should be fungible and that we should be able to choose the type of content that best fits the story.\n\t* This is an output metric and not an outcome metric, but we think it's important for the DAO to get a sense of what quantity of high quality content can be expected from this prop. \n* **Season 2 Goals:** \n\t* 90 minutes of high quality videos delivered (~same as season 1)\n\n\n## Content Pipeline for Season 2\n\n**Writing**\n* Nouns funding Crypto Infra \n* Agora, Prop House, etc.    \n* Nouns is a radical governance experiment\n\t* Covering from the beginning of the DAO and climaxing at the DAO Split implementation\n* What Makes a Nouner Tick?\n    * Include many Nouners vision for the DAO, what makes a good proposal to them etc.\n* Nouns Deli\n \n**Filming**\n* Nouns Esports \n* Xanadu\n\n**Post production**\n* Danit Peleg\n* Rose Parade\n\n\n## Prop House\n\nInvesting in high quality content is super valuable for the DAO, but we also should tap into the power of decentralization to proliferate our content as well. \n\nThe [first Prop House Round](https://prop.house/nounish/growth-hacking-nounish-content) is live and we will be running more of these, both open and targeted rounds. \n\n![](https://imgur.com/efLuwFl.png)\n\n\n## Open Sourcing our Content\n\nAs part of our effort to lean into content proliferation, we will be working on making our content more accessible and easy to use. \n\nSimilar to how nounish gifs are so easy to use on social media, we want our video content to be as accessible and easy to remix and reuse by anyone. \n\nIt will be searchable with tags and key terms, like a stock photo website but for Nouns media and all of it is CC0.\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/U8qxFQ8.png)\n\n\n\n## Minting\n\nWe have started minting our work, to create a deeper connection with our content. The funds will be split between Nouns DAO and our distribution fund so that we can use the funds for further proliferation. \n\n![](https://imgur.com/mM1n6tk.png)\n\n\n## Team\n\nOur team consists of 10 people:\n* [Goldy](https://twitter.com/goldypix) - Lead\n* [142](https://twitter.com/noun142) - Lead\n* John - Creative Director / Editor\n* Haley - Executive Producer\n* Guy - Writer / Director / Editor\n* [Becco](https://twitter.com/Pixel_Becco) - Writer / Host\n* Meline - Producer / Editor\n* [Liam](https://twitter.com/LiamGordes) - Editor & VFX\n* [bk](https://twitter.com/0xbk_) - Social Media\n* 3 freelance helpers\n\n## About Pixel \nMost of our team is from [Pixel](https://pixel.melbourne/), a renowned boutique production company based in Melbourne, Australia. \n\nPixel is a perfect fit for Nouns -  they are experts in making tricky things happen, and believe that clever, complex, and wonderful ideas need nurturing from beginning to end. So they script, design, shoot, animate and finish projects in-house. They have worked across campaigns for world class brands including Adidas, Coca Cola, Toyota, Target, and Sesame Street.\n\nMore team bios in [Prop 143](https://nouns.wtf/vote/143).\n\n\n\n## Budget \n\n**Season 1 planned**\n* Team Compensation + Fixed Costs - $775K\n* 10+ Shoot Days Globally - $113K\n* Growth Experiments (ads, platform-specific experts) - $24K\n* Travel (NFT London, Rose Parade, and 2 more TBD) - $21.5K\n* Steering Committee Stipend ($1k/mo per member) - $18K\n* Legal & forex fees - $17.5K\n\n**Total: $969K**\n\n**Season 1 actuals**\n\n* Fixed costs and compensation $779K\n* Shoots $107K\n* Legal & Fees $28K\n* Travel $28K\n* Distribution/growth $12K\n* Prop House $15K\n* Steering committee $0\n\n**Total: $969K**\n\n**Season 2 planned**\n\n* Fixed costs and compensation $773K\n* Shoots 104K\n* Legal & Fees $14.6K\n* Travel $20K\n* Distribution/growth $5K\n* Prop House $36K\n* Web development $15K\n\n**Total: $969K**\n\n---\n\n# Deep Dive\n\n## Learnings - a retrospective on our last prop\n\nWe want to share our challenges and learnings during season 1 to augment the conversation in the DAO and highlight opportunities for other teams. \n\nOur two top challenges, which we dealt with throughout season 1 are:\n\n1. **Explaining Nouns is very hard**\n\t* Nouns is a very layered topic that is hard to explain succinctly.\n\t* If it's too simplified, it becomes boring and doesn't make any sense.\n\t* Breaking it into parts is also challenging because Nouns makes sense only as one package.\n\t* Different audiences and different contexts require different explanations.\n\t* **Learnings:**\n\t\t* Continue spending a lot of cycles experimenting with different ways and formats to explain Nouns.\n\t\t* Continue iterating on messaging and observing what resonates.\n\n2. **Figuring out our target audience is challenging** \n\t* Initially we tried to target potential builders as our audience, but we felt that it wasn't capturing the opportunity of getting more nouners and fans on board. \n\t* Halfway through season 1 we landed on the thesis that we are looking to reach early adopters of crypto and new tech who will find the Nouns experiment appealing. \n\t* We still don't know exactly who  Nouns resonate with most and who we should target.\n\t\t* We are missing data on the funnel and believe the DAO should spend more resources on figuring this out systematically.\n\t* We grappled a lot with the question of how we get people to **care** about the story of Nouns and the things being built on it and become fans.\n\t* **Learnings:**\n\t\t* **We need more funnel data** - we would love to see a team propose a data project for Nouns to:\n\t\t\t* Understand **who are the builders, nouners, and fans** of the brand\n\t\t\t* Map out the \"customer journey\" of each of the audience segments identified\n\t\t* We are *\n\n\n---\n\nTHIS PROP IS LONGER THAN THE MAX LENGTH FOR SNAPSHOT:\n\n Read the rest of the prop at https://nouns.wtf/vote/289",

      "content": "# NOUNISH FRIENDS mini-figures\n\n# NOUNISH FRIENDS Art Toy mini-figures\n \n  ![](https://i.imgur.com/dhXeIlA.jpg)\n\n**I. WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?**\n\nThese colorful 3‚Äù tall mini figures are meant to be a fun, stylish, low cost, and non-crypto-based entry point into the world of ‚ÄúNOUNs.‚Äù **Nounish Friends** are uniquely styled modular figures which are packed into mystery boxes, eye-catching counter displays positioned for museum shops, high end retail and lifestyle shops worldwide.\n\nThese unique designs represent a perfect evolution of the NOUN PFP to a beautiful and playful tactile art object. (Note: This series will feature 6 unique heads.  Additional characters will be added with future releases or collaborations with other projects.)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WGKqT1P.jpg)\n\n**Why should Nouns fund these mini figures?**\n\nThese Nounish and high quality figures have a FUN modular play feature (interchangeable heads and glasses) that follows the unique building patterns of PFPs and creates infinite possibilities of fun and future extensions. The time is right to release a small colorful collection of figures like this to help promote NOUNS in all of their unique styles and interpretations. \n\n**A prop that assists future props:**\n\nThese mini figure designs are the type of product that will assist in any builders plans for proliferation. For example, David Horvath could use these in his activations in Japan and Korea, as well as NOTG and activations at Art Basel, ETHDenver & NFT London.\n\nCombined with the existing Bigshot Noggles and enamel pins, these mini figures round out a vibrant capsule collection of Nouns merch with mass appeal. This collection will be particularly useful for builders who are planning IRL activations around the world, and easily accessible since all items in the capsule can ship from one centralized location.\n\nThese items are currently being solicited worldwide to museum shops and boutique retail locations.  The feedback has been very positive in regards to design, quality and pricing, but the buyers all need a ship date and review samples before making any commitment to an unknown brand.  \n\nIf the prop is passed we should have these available for distribution all over the world by the end of the year!\n \n ![](https://i.imgur.com/15hqZeX.jpg)\n\n **What's the plan post-production?** \n\nWe have been in contact and actively soliciting retail/museum shop buyers, but they like to see something and order right away, so having production ready and a delivery schedule and final costs to present to them is imperative. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/h972zIu.jpg)\n\n**Who is Bigshot and why are they a solid choice for collectibles?**\n\n[BIGHSHOT TOYWORKS](https://www.bigshottoyworks.com/) has been making high end collectibles and art toys for over 25 years. We have worked with brands such as Nike, Microsoft and Blizzard, and artists like Mark Ryden, Jeff Soto, Steven Harrington and Futura 2000. Bigshot is the premier producer of collectibles like this. We are also behind [NOUNWORKS.WTF](https://www.nounworks.wtf/) and the iconic IRL Noggles.\n\n**II. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT COSTS:**\n\n**TOTAL ASK: $125,000**\n\n¬∑      $65,000 for production of 6,000 units (666 sets of toys)\n¬∑      $40,000 for project management, marketing, distribution\n¬∑      $20,000 for logistics and warehousing\n\nMarketing & project management includes daily factory interactions, QC checks, sample reviews, and revisions, and all aspects of the project related to production. We also handle photography, press outreach, social media campaigns & engagement, client & partner onboarding & follow ups, warehousing, reasonable shipping for marketing opportunities worldwide as needed.\n\n\n**PAYMENT SCHEDULE:** \nUpon passing of Prop, full amount will be sent to Gnosis safe in USDC. Payments to be sent to Bigshot in 3 milestones as follows:\n‚Ä¢ 40% upfront ($50,000 USD): pre-production & production deposit stages\n‚Ä¢ 30% on Milestone 1 ($37,500 USD): production balance, testing, sea shipping, duties, project management, marketing\n‚Ä¢ 30% on Milestone 2 ($37,500 USD): warehousing, logistics, marketing, proliferation management\n\n**PAYMENT DETAILS**\n‚Ä¢ GNOSIS SAFE: USDC will be sent to a Gnosis Safe with the following signers:\nBigshot Klim, noun12.eth, sasqwash.eth\n‚Ä¢ The USDC will be held in a multisig and be released to Bigshot when Milestones are completed.\nMultisig Adress: [0x7C9878E913d6AE8Fe8cf10783Ded77070b9cA68E](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7C9878E913d6AE8Fe8cf10783Ded77070b9cA68E)\n\n**III. FUTURE STEPS**\n\nOur 6000 physical toys will be utilized for both wholesale and retail sales for maximum reach and value. We believe that both are important aspect of this proof-of-concept model moving forward:\n\n‚Ä¢ 10% of the production will be allocated to community members and other Nouns initiatives like STUDIO1 activation in JP, Nouns Deli, Nouns Amigos, Nouns Africa and Art Basel Miami etc.(Shipping not included) \n‚Ä¢ Units to be sold in shops at approx $16/toy, or approx $9 wholesale + shipping. A portion of the sales will be used to develop series 2 and will be put forth in a new proposal if the project is a success.\n‚Ä¢ Option for DAO allocated additional quantities from this edition at $9/unit\n‚Ä¢ Option to re-order at lower unit cost in a future run.\n‚Ä¢ Option to create unique colorways & revised single figure packaging for targeted events and activations with NOUNish events like ALPS Dao, Gnars Dao, NOUNS Amigos. NOTG and Potential POP-UP retail activations.\n‚Ä¢ We'd like to have some expedited product available for San Diego Comic-Con and David's activations in Japan to showcase and promote Nouns in key places.\n‚Ä¢ All of the items ship from a central location in the USA so the marketing and proliferation logistics are perfectly aligned.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/q7YhCLQ.jpg)\n\nPROJECT HISTORY:\n\n[Prop 72](https://houseofnouns.wtf/nouns/proposals/72) was funded with 20ETH to take this project from initial idea, through countless iterations, to the current designs & prototypes. We have communicated updates weekly on the Discord here and have had many conversations on Discourse here, gathering feedback from over 50 comments to arrive at the final designs proposed in Prop 141. \n \n[Prop 141](https://houseofnouns.wtf/nouns/proposals/141) had some heated contentious voting at 78 for and 88 against with the majority of the for votes coming from individual holders.\n\nProp 141 has identified some pain points for the Nouners that are being addressed here to secure funding for production, marketing and distribution of these blind box minifigures to the museum shops, boutiques and art toy shops and galleries worldwide.\n\nThank you so much for your support, we look forward to getting this prop on chain, and to get these figures to the world in time for the holidays.

Nouns Wet Wipes will become a permanent item in the market after this initial investment of **USD 31,450** + **2 ETH** (up from USD 19,050 prop 265).\n\n# Overview\nNouns Wet Wipes!! \n*It defends* (Against bacteria & viruses)!!\n*It protects* (Against bacteria & viruses)!!\n*It moisturizes* (Dry skin)!!\n*Now it spreads* (The Nouns Brand) !!!\n\n![B2](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52872018760_9b5f0a4406_c.jpg)\n\n# Goals\n1. Bringing Noun Wet Wipes to the masses, one pocket at a time!\n2. A thoughtful token to be given out during events.\n3. Inexpensive way of marketing the Noun‚Äôs brand to the public.\n4. After initial investment into print drums, the wet wipes can continuously be produced at a low cost, increasing Brand Awareness perpetually.\n\n# Details\nNothing beats the branding effect of a product that one carries around all day. Using these wipes will remind you of the Noun brand no matter where you are. Having these Nouns Wet Wipes sold near the checkout counters will definitely have an impact on brand awareness. With our custom eye catching wrapper, you just can‚Äôt miss it!\n\n**In our first prop we left out a lot of information which we thought (at that time) wasn‚Äôt really important or just minor details. We apologize and we have added them into this prop.**\n\n\n **WHY WIPES?**\n1. It's one of the common things you would carry around such as your keys, wallet, phone and sanitiser. A reminder of the Noun‚Äôs brand whenever you use it!\n2. Economical to give away during events. Has utility so won‚Äôt be thrown away once you get home from the events.\n3. Small enough to be easily displayed at the Checkout counters for maximum exposure.\n4. Have enough space on the back of the item to incorporate a qr-code.\n5. Something our team has experience working with!\n\n**PACK SIZE 8‚Äôs Consideration**\n\n***Why 8‚Äôs?***\n\n1. This is the pack size that most will carry around. Unless you have a baby then a bigger pack size is required during diaper changes, but we are not doing that here‚Ä¶ yet!\n2. This is the pack size that takes up little space so it can be displayed at the checkout counter. \n3. Checkout counter sales are mostly ‚Äòimpulse‚Äô buys and thus less price sensitive. As you move up the pack size, customers become more price sensitive. We have not reached scale production, therefore we cannot produce them at the lowest cost possible and thus need to target the less price sensitive range.\n4. Lowest cost to be given out at events.\n\n**Marketing Considerations**\nInitially we weren‚Äôt planning on asking for a big marketing budget, however it seems to be one of the biggest reasons for rejection of prop265. \n\n**Our initial plan**\nSell into retail outlets at cost to proliferate. We know (from sales data, can‚Äôt share where from sorry >_<) that wet wipes **average sales** per month at checkout counters (or POS = Point of Sale as we call it) are around **30** packs per month. \nWe have (110 cartons x 144 packs) 15,840 packs to sell off. \n- It will take 528 POS one month to sell off.\n- Or 44 POS per year. \n- 44 POS = 22 retail outlets with a minimum of 2 POS each.\n\n22 outlets is a very, very doable number just with our contacts alone, but it will take **ONE YEAR‚Äôs** time without any additional marketing funding. As some suggest we sell out in a shorter time frame, we shall therefore request a budget for marketing.\n\n## New Marketing Initiative\n**Goals**\n- To sell all wet wipes in **ONE MONTH**. Based on healthcare retail data, a distribution chain of 200 outlets yields close to $150 million in total revenue per annum. Through our networks, deploying to 110 outlets on day one is possible. That way, our product holding period will be kept to a minimum (< 30 days). \n- To incentivise the outlets to let out prime retail shelf space, we developed an extra budget to ‚Äúrent‚Äù their prime-est location, which is their point of sale (POS) aka cashier counter location to display our impulse purchase / daily necessity item. Making it easier to reach the customers.\n- To boost the nounish branding and create a movement. Leveraging on the power of social media and the attractiveness of prizes.\n\n**‚ÄòSell Out‚Äô in 1 Month**\nIdeally, the wipes should be sold out within a month. With our current contacts, we should be able to ‚Äòsell-in‚Äô to 120 outlets nationwide but to further increase exposure, we will be renting *prime* space within the retail outlets.\n\n**‚ÄòRenting‚Äô Prime Space - Cost USD 6,000**\nWe will pay for prime POS display space at certain higher volume retail outlets to greatly increase exposure. 3-month‚Äôs display will only cost around USD 60 per POS space (thanks to its small size). We plan to ‚Äòrent‚Äô 100 prime POS display spaces which would cost USD 6,000.\n\n![Prime Area](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52871984559_d00d9e56f7_c.jpg)\n***Example of prime retail space circled in red***\n\nThe moment we sell 80% of the wipes, we would make another batch. No cost to the DAO as it will be paid for from the sales of the first batch. This Prop is self sustaining and will continue to proliferate the Nouns Brand as long as we sell out and make new batches.\n\n**Social Media Marketing - Cost USD 650 + 1 Carton of Wipes**\nThe main objective of the marketing campaigns is to reach the local and online population rapidly and ***encourage community participation to proliferate*** the nouns brand.\n\n- Like & Share incentive: This campaign will be targeted at our retail partners, to share our content to their network, at a small incentive of $50 per quarter.  (Limited to 10 participating partners)\n- Video creation incentive: We will run an online 10 second video format contest for everyone to submit, and we will pick a winner and reward them with a $50 prize. (One per month for 3 months)\n- One carton of wipes will be set aside as the prizes for fun contests such as ‚ÄúSpot our Wipes in the Wild‚Äù, Fun Photo Submissions for customers who bought the wipes and uploaded in social media, etc.\n\n\n**Design Considerations**\nAgain initially we weren't going to spend much on design since it was going to be a minimum viable product (MVP), design would just increase the initial cost as well as the running cost of the product. Our experience with wet wipes was that as long as it had an eye-catching color and the word ‚Äòwipes‚Äô was visible, it would sell at the POS counter. Packaging design was low on our list of priorities. A quick search on Amazon would reveal that the best selling wipes have a simple and minimalistic design.\n\n![Original Wrapper](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52799159996_17b91fb903_c.jpg)\n***Original wrapper design from Prop 265***\n\nThe original wrapper‚Äôs simple design (F) and single color was chosen with the costing of the print drum in mind. Every color we add to the wrapper increases the cost of the print drum significantly. \n\nHowever the DAO has spoken. A minimum standard of design must be followed as hot.4156.eth replied in the vote, and so we shall deliver. We shall set a high bar for these wipes and our future product development designs.\n\nWe will increase the number of colors for the design of the wrapper from 1 color in Prop 265 to 5 colors. We will be asking for funding for 5 colors, if however the chosen design has less than 5 colors, the extra funds would be sent back to the DAO treasury.\n\n**Design Contest** *[Link](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/design-win-eth-nouns-wet-wipes-design-contest/4411/19)*\nWe have received input from some very helpful friends and the community that design cost may spiral out of control and that the results are still not guaranteed. So as to not go overboard with the design budget while retaining control over how much we pay, we have opted for a ‚ÄòCommunity Design Contest‚Äô style of choosing and paying for the design. \n\nPayment will be fixed at **2 Eth** for the designs of the wipes. Since there are 4 components of the design that are required for wipes we think it‚Äôs fair for the winning design to receive 1.5 Eth while 0.5 Eth will be split among the top 2-5 designers.\nThe four parts of the design.\n\n1. The wrapper\n2. The flap\n3. The box for holding 12 packs\n4. The 3D mockup of the product\n\n**The Contest Judges**\nThe judges of this contest would be the DAO itself so please choose which design you like best and let us know in the ‚ÄòReason‚Äô section when you vote. We will also take into account ‚ÄòAgainst‚Äô votes if you did choose the design you like. 1 noun 1 vote. \n\n![Reason](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52872458095_478bc5e60f_z.jpg)\n\n# Distribution to Nouns DAO Events\n39 cartons of the wet wipes will be reserved for the events Nouns DAO has committed to attending (example: PROP 206) as well as future events that require merch to be given out. We will collect USD 5000 as shipping for this purpose, any leftovers will be returned to the DAO. If there‚Äôs a shortfall, the event organizers can pay the shipping to get it.\n\n# Specifications\nEach Pack will consist of 8 pcs of fragrance-free antibacterial wet wipe.\n\n- Wipes size: 150mm x 140mm\n- 12 packs in a Display Box \n- 12 boxes in a carton. Each carton contains 144 packs of wipes (8pcs)\n- Minimum order quantity (MOQ) for each run is 150 cartons.\n- Ingredients: Aqua, Propylene Glycol, Polyaminopropyl Biguanide, Polysorbate 20, Benzalkonium Chloride, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Tocopheryl Acetate and a bit of Nounishness ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\nWet wipes will be manufactured by our vetted local manufacturer in Malaysia which are certified GMP ISO 22716:2007 & QMS ISO 9001:2015\n\n\n# Costing\n1. Design cost ------------------------------------------------------- 2 ETH\n2. Marketing cost\n    a. ‚ÄòRent‚Äô prime POS for maximum exposure‚Äî----------------- USD 6,000\n    b. Social media marketing ‚Äî------------------------------------ USD 650\n3. Print drum for nouns sticker design (one-time cost) ---------- USD 2,000\n4. Custom wet wipes wrapper print mold (one-time cost) ------- USD 8,500\n5. Display Box mold  -------------------------------------------- USD 1,500\n6. 150 cartons of wet wipes (USD 52 per carton) ---------------- USD 7,800\n7. Shipping to 20 events around the world (2 cartons each) ----- USD 5,000\n\n**Total USD 31,450 + 2 ETH**\n\nPrint mold and drum prices increased from Prop 265 due to increased complexity and the number of colors of the designs. Printing costs also increased due to the increased colors thus increasing cost per carton from USD 49 to USD 52.\n\n# Team Remuneration\nWe plan to set the Recommended Retail Price of below USD 1 while making it worthwhile for retail outlets to sell. Our team will take the net proceeds (after deducting warehousing, logistic and distribution costs) from the sales of the 110 cartons (40 cartons reserved for events) as remuneration. If we don‚Äôt sell, we don‚Äôt get paid! \n\nFuture orders of this current design Noun wipes will cost significantly less as we already have the design and mold for the packaging. Should anyone require more Noun Wet Wipes, please contact us.\n\n# Who are we?\nNoun 587 is a pharmacist by training, entrepreneur at heart.

      "content": "# üáßüá∑ NFT.Brasil - Taking Over S√£o Paulo and Celebrating the Brazilian Community\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cNvhtov.png)\n\n## TL:DR \n\nNouns leads the NFT movement in Brazil thanks to its community, but we are just getting started. We are proposing a huge Sao Paulo city takeover starting in NFT.Brasil event.\n\nOur goal is to achieve a massive and innovative onboarding experience for all attendees, and to do so, we will be present in five strategic areas throughout the event journey. These include the NFT Exhibition, Speaker Sessions, Lounge, Metaverse, and Street Gallery ([Eletromedia](https://eletromidia.com.br/) OOH advertising). \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3CH4aRq.png)\n\nNFT.Brasil is a pioneering conference celebrating the cutting-edge advancements and possibilities of the NFT world that is set to take place in Sao Paulo city, **Brazil on June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, 2023.**\n\nWe want to bring Nouns to NFT.Brasil. The event is expected to attract over 30,000 individuals. The venue is the iconic Bienal, which is a true masterpiece of contemporary design, and is a premier cultural destination in Brazil.\n\n## The Brazilian Genesis\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P10GPfy.jpg)\n\n[click here to open](https://i.imgur.com/TfWFIsY.jpeg)\n\n## What is NFT.Brasil?\n\nGet ready to witness an exciting fusion of art, technology, and innovation at NFT.Brasil, a pioneering conference that is all set to take place in the heart of Sao Paulo. Hosted at the iconic Bienal, the event promises to be a one-of-a-kind experience that brings together digital artists and web3 builders from across Brazil.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WS14MiW.gif)\n\nThe mockup video gives you a sneak peek of what's to come: [click here to watch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYCPjVRjLDA)\n\nThe Bienal, also known as the Biennial Pavilion, is a landmark cultural institution located in the heart of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. It was designed by the legendary Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and was first opened in 1951 to host the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial, which is one of the world's most prestigious art exhibitions. \n\nHosting the NFT.Brasil conference at the Bienal is a testament to the venue's reputation as a premier cultural destination, and it promises to be an ideal setting for the fusion of art and technology that is at the heart of the NFT movement.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0gS9Ksp.jpg)\n\nThe event will be held on June 2nd, 3rd, and 4th and will be divided into two areas. The NFT exhibition will showcase Brazilian and international artists, collections, projects, and DAOs. The second area will host talks and lectures, bringing the community together to discuss the technology and its impact on our present and future. With a combination of NFT art exhibitions and speaker sessions, the event expects to attract over 30,000 individuals seeking knowledge, connections, and business opportunities in the field.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GupEgWM.jpg)\n\nWith a population of over 12 million residents, S√£o Paulo is one of the largest and most vibrant cities in the world, making it the perfect backdrop for this exciting event. \n\n## What does Nouns gets by funding this proposal?\n\nBesides being a huge celebration of the Nouns community in Brazil and what we've been building for 9 months after NFT.Rio, and also being a great chance to bring new people on board, Nouns DAO will get:\n\n### Open-air NFT exhibition - [Eletromedia](https://eletromidia.com.br/)\n\nFor 20 days, NFT.Brasil will host the largest open-air NFT exhibition in the world. In partnership with Eletromedia, Brazil's leading Out of Home media company, NFT.Brasil will showcase artists' works at over 40,000 media spots throughout the cities of S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, and Fortaleza. \n\nWe want Nouns to be a part of this activation. **Last year at NFT.Rio, the same exhibition setup led the Nouns 367 sale bought by Sanuxo for 113.22 ETH.**\n\n### **PS:** Although what Eletromedia deliver in outreach is worth 400k USD, we've tailored a special nounish activation to just $25k.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HrGlQ5F.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gtsn3ig.jpg)\n\n#### Distribution of Eletromidia Presence in Sao Paulo\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ydOnnUg.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Q1BghWr.png)\n\nOver 40,000 media spots throughout four big cities in Brazil, with a total population of **24,3 million people.**\n\n### Nouns Lounge\n\nThe 25m¬≤ lounge will be comfortable and have an inviting atmosphere for attendees to gather. The space will feature puffs, chairs, and tables strategically arranged to showcase the websites, auctions, and content from some nounish projects: **Nouns**, **Foodnouns**, **Gnars**, **Lil Nouns**, and **Nouns BR**. The lounge is sure to be a must-visit destination for event-goers seeking the latest information and updates on Nouns and its innovative projects. A perfect place to onboard new people into the ecosystem.\n\nThe lounge will be inspired by the amazing work [Nouns Amigos](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos) is doing with the Nouns Fair.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M9w2gmk.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eA7Fk2t.png)\n\nThe decision to locate the lounge right beside the speakers is a badass choice for several reasons.  It **puts Nouns at the heart of the event**, giving unrivaled **visibility** and **exposure**. Attendees will be drawn to the dynamic atmosphere around the speakers, and we will be perfectly positioned to engage with them as they move in and out of the area. Such special location will enable Nouns to build the brand and network. Three members of Nouns BR (JP, Guiriba and Debussy) will be there to welcome and onboard people who pass by the lounge. Additionally, we have planned some exciting magnet activations that are sure to grab the attention of passersby and draw them to our lounge.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BlLWPOD.png)\n\n\n### Metaverse\n\nNFT.Brasil is creating a metaverse in either Cryptovoxels and Spatial, designed by the talented metarchitect Fabio Ema. During the four-day IRL event, everything will be broadcasted there. After that, the NFT.Brasil team will keep it active for three months with online events, and the community will be able to use it as they see fit, forever. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6cJJdRG.gif)\n\nMake sure to watch the [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FfSsVZsFZM)!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LQ8o9JA.jpg)\n\n\nWhen we say take over S√£o Paulo, we mean it. Check out the **S√£o Paulo MAYOR** nounified entering the Metaverse for the first time üëá \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/hZksJkY/ezgif-com-crop.gif)\n\nEverything built for Cryptovoxels is a token. After the event, the Nouns building and avatars will be a legacy for the DAO. We are going to airdrop the building token in the wallet of all voters and also we will make the Nouns heads available as avatars, so anyone can be voxel-nounified to attend our metaverse agenda.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/x64jCWN/ezgif-com-video-to-gif.gif)\n\n### Main Stage\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dRT2vCC.jpg)\n\n\nAubtoshi is an exciting addition to the lineup of main stage speakers at the upcoming NFT.Brasil event. As a highly influential figure in the Nouns community, Aubtoshi's presentation is sure to be a highlight of the event. Her expertise and experience within the Nouns ecosystem will provide valuable insights for attendees, while her engaging speaking style and natural charisma are sure to captivate the audience. \n\nWe'll also have a builders panel with Nouns BR members such as JP, Guiriba, Debussy, Vlad and others. They will tell  their stories within the ecosystem and invite the audience to join the Nouns community.\n\n### NFT.Brasil Exhibition\n\nNFT.Brasil is excited to announce that the upcoming exhibition will feature an exclusive art display by Nouns, alongside other highly respected collections such as Crypto Punks, and Doodles, BAYC and of course innovative navite brazilian collections. As one of the featured collections, Nouns will have a prominent position in the exhibition, offering visitors a chance to explore the ecosystem and engage with Nouns team. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uVh9ccj.png)\n\n**Building community, Every Day, Forever**\n\nThis event is not only a celebration of our achievements so far, but also a unique opportunity to showcase Nouns brand to millions of people across Brazil's largest cities for several weeks.

We‚Äôre requesting $42,000 in funding to support PizzaDAO‚Äôs third global pizza party for [Bitcoin Pizza Day](https://twitter.com/RarePizzas/status/1528475500993208323) on May 22, 2023. Through this grant we‚Äôre seeking to co-brand Nouns x PizzaDAO‚Äôs Bitcoin Pizza Day events currently being organized in 90+ cities around the globe.\n\nAll funds collected through this grant will go towards purchasing pizza from independent pizzerias on Bitcoin Pizza Day for our pizza parties all over the world. [Learn more about PizzaDAO and Rare Pizzas here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNdbUERvVN4)\n\n## TLDR ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\nThis proposal directly funds 12,000+ slices of pizza that will be distributed through local PizzaDAO events and community organizations on May 22, 2023.\n\n1. **Nounifying Bitcoin Pizza Day** Onboarding communities one slice at a time. Co-branding marketing materials, events, and media reaching tens of thousands of participants globally.\n2. **Nounish Pizza Parties** Proliferation through pizza and furthering Nouns OTG presence at PizzaDAO events\n3. **Nounish Social Activation** Nouns x PizzaDAO claimable NFT for event participants and online proliferators\n\n\n\n\n\n![Pizza Noun 292 and Molto Benny|690x345, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/CxvDXsy5/1.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe believe that PizzaDAO is well-aligned as a Nounish brand partner for Nouns and our Global Pizza Party for Bitcoin Pizza Day provides a low-risk opportunity to advance proliferation of Nouns through earned media and activations at IRL events ‚Äì all while doing some good and bringing people together with free pizza.\n\nPizzaDAO has been an active member of the Nounish community with our pizza parties at web3 conference events and in the Nounish community more broadly. This funding proposal would cement the vibes and values of PizzaDAO and Nouns together as well as spread the messages of community and funding weird stuff around the globe.\n\nPizzaDAO recently joined Nouns as a new member sub-DAO through the acquisition of the \"We Pizza\" Noun 292 and is committed to expanding the Nounish ecosystem through its events and network of contributors.\n\n\n![Pizza taste better when wearing Noggles |690x345, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/zDnh8rm9/2.png)\n\n\n\n\n## WHO WE ARE ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\nWe are a global community of hackers, pizza enthusiasts, NFT creators, collectors, artists and rebels who believe in using crypto to make the world a better place.\n\nPizzaDAO‚Äôs community is made up of new entrants to the industry and members that have been in the crypto space for years, including several NounsDAO members, early Bitcoin community organizers, Gitcoin KERNEL Fellows, and past award recipients. PizzaDAO alumni now work on countless other projects in the crypto space, a direct result of our commitment to education and onboarding.\n\n### Let's Form Group Collab.Land Mini-Doc ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\n\n\n\n[![Snax.eth / Noun 292 |690x348](https://i.postimg.cc/0yvF49fx/Screenshot-050223-011515-PM.jpg)](https://youtu.be/qNdbUERvVN4)\n\n\n\n\n\n## OUR IMPACT ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\nTo date, PizzaDAO has given away over $600,000 worth of real, edible pizza in more than 75 countries. You might have eaten some during previous global pizza parties or at NFT.NYC, DCentral Miami, NFT Paris, NFT Sydney, ETHDenver, SXSW, NFTLA, Consensus, or one of the many smaller events we've supported. Now, we need your help!\n\n* Over 200,000 slices served\n* Over 500 pizzerias supported\n* Presence in 75+ countries\n* Thousands of people onboarded to web3\n* Over $600,000 of pizza given away!\n\n![PizzaDAO Global Party Map|690x260, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/9Q4FXdRr/Screenshot-2023-04-24-at-4-08-32-PM.png)\n\n\n## OUR MODEL ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\nRare Pizzas is a cc0 project founded by the decentralized autonomous organization PizzaDAO. We came together on February 18th, 2021 to make 10,000 generative pizzas in a one-of-a-kind collaboration between 314 international toppings artists. This collaboration has gone on to raise over $1M through the sale of the NFTs, funding two global pizza parties and a large number of community events. As we build, our ultimate goal is to build solutions for independent pizzerias (software, marketing, consulting, etc.) and eventually conduct individual token-raises to enable communities to buy out their local pizzeria‚Äôs landlord and sign a rental contract with the pizzeria.\n\nLook beneath the hood of our pizza planning by visiting [parties.pizzadao.xyz](http://parties.pizzadao.xyz) and [playbook.pizzadao.xyz](http://playbook.pizzadao.xyz)\n\n## Nouns x PizzaDAO Bitcoin Pizza Day 2023 ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\nBitcoin Pizza Day is already the one de facto crypto holiday. Together as a community, we can grow this celebration of cryptocurrency and pizza into a truly global event. The internet, cryptocurrency, and pizza are all global phenomena. Bringing them together by giving away free pizza funded by the blockchain is a strong invitation to the general public to join our ecosystem. We think that‚Äôs pretty Nounish!\n\n![PizzaDAO Global Pizza Party 2022 on an active volcano|690x407, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/V6FzZ4TH/Screenshot-2023-04-24-at-4-24-19-PM.png)\n\n### Nounifying Bitcoin Pizza Day ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\nWe want to onboard communities one slice at a time. Our goal is to Nounify Bitcoin Pizza Day while creating touch points with potential collaborators through IRL activations at community events. Nouns assets will be integrated throughout PizzaDAO‚Äôs marketing materials, events, and branding to highlight the partnership, presenting Nouns as the core contributor for PizzaDAO‚Äôs global pizza party 2023.\n\n![Molto Benny x Nouns|649x322, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/qv9BNNyQ/Screenshot-2023-04-24-at-4-19-21-PM.png)\n\n\n### Nounish Pizza Parties ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\nHaving Nounish gear present at our pizza parties makes a lasting impression on our guests. Nouns Pizza Party Kits featuring props and swag will be sent to organizers to allow attendees to participate in Nounish photobooths and other IRL activations. Parties will also feature cardboard cutouts of PizzaDAO‚Äôs \"We Pizza\" Noun #292 and co-branded material will be visible to attendees throughout the event and on social media. We had a strong Nounish presence at our Wen Pizza? party during NFT NYC and  a similarly strong presence at our event during Consensus ATX (we ordered a $600 box of Noun props from Big Shot Toyworks). See the results in videos like [this one](https://twitter.com/Pizza_DAO/status/1652495611445354497), which has over 8k views so far.\n\n![Nouns photobooth at PizzaDAO's NFTNYC party|690x460, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/4yfSjpnN/1681422067825.jpg)\n\n\n### Nounish Social Activation ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\nNouns x PizzaDAO NFTs designed by Nounish builder BigShotToyWorks featuring PizzaDAO‚Äôs pizza noun #292. QR code signs will be displayed at premier parties featuring PizzaDAO x Nouns Global Pizza Party branding to allow participants to claim a ‚ÄúPizzaNounies‚Äù NFT.\n\n![PizzaNounies NFT|500x500, 75%](https://i.postimg.cc/GtGRKFB7/image-1.png)\n\n\n\n### **WHY?**  ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\nWe‚Äôre helping pizzerias around the world use crypto to empower their businesses while giving back to their communities. We believe that we can assist businesses to become community owned by tokenizing the pizzerias in our network using open source technology. Beyond that, we believe that pizza is a public good and that Rare Pizzas‚Äô Art to Pizza model can be replicated to solve some of the world‚Äôs biggest problems while spreading joy (and sauce).\n\nWe created our Global Pizza Party as an accessible and fun way to get introduced to and utilize blockchain technologies. Plus, throwing a global pizza party is a good team-building exercise for Spaceship Earth!\n\n* We believe markets can be positive sum and can enrich communities\n* We believe that we can use digital scarcity to bring analog plenty\n* We believe artists deserve to be honored and compensated\n* We believe anyone should be allowed to help others without asking for permission\n* We believe memes are powerful vessels for raising awareness\n* We believe in equal inclusion of all pizza toppings (yes, even pineapple)\n\n## FUNDING BREAKDOWN ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\n15% of funds collected through this grant will be used to purchase Nouns Pizza Party Kits containing Nouns swag and props from BigShotToyWorks. The remaining 85% of the funds collected through this grant will be used to purchase pizza from independent pizzerias all over the world for our events.\n\n![Funding Breakdown](https://i.postimg.cc/6QCJNRxJ/Screenshot-2023-05-02-at-1-28-59-PM.png)\n\n\n**Nouns Pizza Party Kits:**\n [Plastic Noggles ](https://bigshottoyshop.com/products/noggles-10pc-carton-red)\n[Paper Noggles](https://bigshottoyshop.com/products/nouns-paper-glasses-50-pack)\n[Noggle Pins ](https://bigshottoyshop.com/products/nouns-glasses-100-pack)\n\n## MULTISIG ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\nFunds will be distributed to PizzaDAO.eth and supervised by Nounish countributors: \n* Snax\n* 87Bones \n* Oni\n* BigShotToyWorks\n* ProfWerder\n\n### ‚ÄúWe Pizza‚Äù Noun 292\n![Noun 292|506x500, 50%](https://i.postimg.cc/m2pgGXrv/Screenshot-2023-04-30-at-10-20-16-PM.png)\n\n### Snax (PizzaDAO Founder)\n![Snax.eth x Nogglels|399x500, 50%](https://i.postimg.cc/W1sCXTjj/83767962-ae56-4881-b878-efa0edb64922.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 283 - Clothing, Every Day, Forever",
      "content": "# Clothing, Every Day, Forever\n\n## **TL;DR** \n- Allocate **75,800 USDC** for the development of **wears.wtf‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®**, a  clothing brand that transforms Nouns' incredible CC0 assets into distinctive, ready-to-wear clothing.\n- By **collaborating with [LEBLANCSTUDIOS](https://www.instagram.com/leblancstudios/?hl=en), a fashion brand with 10+ years in experience**, we seek to bring wears.wtf‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® to market very smoothly. \n    - Initial collection marketing will be directed towards the Nounish Ecosystem, Twitter, and LEBLANCSTUDIOS' customer base (3500+ customers). \n- This process will be divided in 2 phases: [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] and [PRODUCTION EXPANSION].\n    - **[PROOF-OF-DEMAND]** is this **current** proposal.\n        - Includes a 100-200 piece test limited-edition drop to measure demand and other metrics. \n        - After the test drop, we'll be launching a 400 piece drop focused on the nounssentials line (explained later on the prop). \n    - **[PRODUCTION EXPANSION]** would be a **future** proposal. \n    - After both phases are done, wears.wtf‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® will effectively become completely self-sustainable,and will keep iterating, experimenting, and ultimately growing as a business & platform. \n- wears.wtf‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® opens up endless possibilities, such as creating limited edition clothing for an specific cause, designing apparel inspired by Nouns community events, and incorporating fashion into proposals across various domains.\n\n## **THE WEARS.WTF TEAM** \n\n[LEBLANCSTUDIOS](https://www.instagram.com/leblancstudios/?hl=en). A Dominican clothing brand founded in 2014. With an awareness of globalization, highlighting personal identity, LEBLANCSTUDIOS strives to become a social and cultural  movement that empowers an emerging generation of people across all continents to express themselves.  **LEBLANCSTUDIOS is available among retailers like [ODIN NYC](https://odinnewyork.com/) (USA) and [THE FORUMIST](https://store.theforumist.com/) (EUROPE)**.\n- **LEBLANCSTUDIOS will provide the following talent to the wears.wtf team**: \n    - 2 Senior Creative Directors & Co-Founders of LEBLANCSTUDIOS:\n        -  Angelo Beato & Yamil Arbaje\n    - Fashion Marketer, Pattern Maker, Material Sourcing Specialist, Production Manager, Sales/E-COMM Manager, Graphic Designer, Copywriter, Editor\n\n- **LEBLANCSTUDIOS is also providing already established partnerships with manufacturers in the following countries**: Turkey, Peru, India, Italy, Portugal, China, USA\n\n\n[necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas). I (necfas) have always desired to wear clothing that embodies the essence of Nouns in one way or another. Rather than purchasing generic t-shirts and having them embroidered or printed myself, I wanted apparel that genuinely reflects the unique significance that Nouns hold for me. As the nounish creative lead, my role is to ensure that the designs we create are in sync with the Nouns culture. I will be responsible for providing creative suggestions and guidance, aiming to produce intriguing and exceptional designs that best represent the essence of Nouns. This is a genuine, wholehearted attempt to offer something that could potentially bring significant value to the DAO. \n\n\n\n## **2 PHASES**\n### [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] & [PRODUCTION EXPANSION]\n\n- This phase aims to gauge the community's interest in the clothing line by producing a limited-edition, low-supply (100-200) collection. After the test drop, we'll be launching a 400 piece drop focused on the nounssentials line. Phase 1's marketing will be focused towards the Nouns community, twitter, and LEBLANCSTUDIOS' customer base. We will use promotional videos and clothing shoots to gather attention for the launch. \n\n    -  **Phase 1 will clearly define the following metrics**:\n        - Cost of Goods Sold \n        - Gross Margin\n        - Operating Expenses\n        - Net Profit Margin\n        - Sell-through Rate\n        - Conversion Rate\n        - Average Order Value (AOV)\n        - Return on Investment (ROI) - limited to the scale of the first collection\n    \n*The wears.wtf team will produce reports of these metrics on a regular basis in order to be as transparent as possible.* \n\n- Once PROOF-OF-DEMAND is completed, we'll move on to the next phase PRODUCTION EXPANSION, a future proposal. We'll start producing the other clothing lines, like NOUNSWEAR and NOUNSJACKETS (explained later in the prop). \n    - After the Production Expansion phase, the project will be able to support itself, and we'll always include special Nounish details in our branding to maintain the origin. We'll also make sure nounssentials are available to purchase online everyday, forever. Phase 2 will include a thourough marketing campaign that will focus on expanding to a broader audience, including non-crypto-natives by leveraging all of the metrics acquired during phase 1. \n\n    -  **Phase 2 will clearly define the following metrics**:\n        - Inventory Turnover\n        - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) \n        - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)\n        - Conversion Rate\n        - Customer Retention Rate\n        - Return on Investment (ROI) - overall various collections\n\n\n\n## **HOW**\n\n **Collaboration and Design Process**: \n- The LEBLANCSTUDIOS' team and I (necfas) have worked to create unique designs that resonate with the Nouns community. The design process will involve brainstorming, sketching, and refining concepts that embody the essence of the community and its values.\n-  This collaboration ensures that the final designs are a perfect blend of art, fashion, and what's considered nounish.\n\n**Design Selection and Production**: \n- After gathering feedback and iterating on the designs, the team will finalize 8 different designs for the nounssentials drop, once the [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] limited edition TEST drop is complete.\n- the [PROOF-OF-DEMAND] limited edition TEST drop will consist of 100-200 limited edition pieces.\n- The nounssentials 8 final designs, 400 piece drop will be done afterwards. \n\n*note: Scaling down production was considered, but even if the Nouns ecosystem doesn‚Äôt purchase the proposed amounts, LEBLANCSTUDIOS‚Äô customer base will. They‚Äôve shown excitement for the unique designs they‚Äôve never seen before. It‚Äôs crucial for us to begin working on the next collection batch right after the test drop. Going through another proposal process, which would cause weeks of funding delay, wouldn‚Äôt be optimal for securing production spots and establishing dates with the manufacturers by paying upfront.*\n\n**Quality and Sustainability**: \n- The wears.wtf team has prioritized finding the best sustainable quality/price ratio for the garments. \n- We are in contact with reputable manufacturers to ensure ethically made clothing, and that the final products are not only stylish and comfortable but also durable. \n\n**Community Feedback and Iteration**: \n- Throughout the design process, the team will engage with the community through twitter & discord (JUNGLE, NOUNISH, NOUNCIL) to gather feedback on the proposed designs.\n-  By conducting polls, discussions, and sharing design mockups, the team will ensure that the community's preferences and ideas are taken into account. This iterative approach will help refine the designs, making them more appealing to the community members.\n\n**Launching the First Collection**: \n- Once the designs are finalized and produced, the first drop of the wears.wtf collection will be launched. This collection will focus on creating clothing that embodies the \"Clothing, Every Day, Forever\" concept, making it an essential piece for every Nouns community member's wardrobe. \n- By offering versatile and stylish garments, the collection aims to become an integral part of the community members' daily lives, allowing them to express their Nounishness.\n\n\n## **CLOTHING, EVERYDAY, FOREVER** \n\n### **NOUNSSENTIALS: Made for everyone. For Everyday, Forever.**\n- **Essential clothes** **made** **from sustainable materials** include items like organic cotton t-shirts, hemp or linen pants, and bamboo socks. By choosing sustainable materials for our everyday clothing, we can make a positive impact on the environment while also staying comfortable and stylish.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BYTzO1m.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CkvjwWq.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YTMLZ8S.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qKRb4am.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GJUnNn6.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5FphJbM.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AQcSXGn.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tJYYR8Q.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DU75H6a.png)\n*THESE ARE NOT FINAL DESIGNS*\n\n\n### **NOUNSWEAR: Creative Expression**\n- NOUNSWEAR **aims to explore the streetwear and artistic aspects of clothing**, emphasizing creativity, unique designs, and personal expression, which caters to those looking to make a bold fashion statement. It will follow a drop-by-drop format with limited edition pieces, taking into account essential Nounish activities and accomplishments. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/L4okh4b.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ufqJU9Z.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5UUylyH.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PjQzU3b.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Vhzfy8j.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HGnwvMa.png)\n*THESE ARE NOT FINAL DESIGNS*\n\n\n### **NOUNSJACKET: Nounish Representation**\n\n- The NOUNSJACKET **aims to be a set of tailor made jacket for different NOUNISH BUILDERS that have constant exposure to a wide audience** (Nouns Fair, Aubtoshi, Becco, Nounsesports, etc).\n- The jackets will be designed through back and forth conversations with differet builders about their preferences and the representative elements they would like in their jackets. Builders will be able to contact the team in order to tailor-make their jacket with the specific requirements they would want. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/u8vI8Fs.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Wg7vavU.png)\n*THESE ARE NOT FINAL DESIGNS*\n\n\n## **THIS ISN'T MERCH, THIS IS READY-TO-WEAR**\n- **Ready-to-wear clothing offers a superior level of comfort and everyday wearability compared to merch, thanks to its focus on quality materials, design, fit, and attention to detail**. These collections will be crafted by experienced designers who prioritize the use of high-quality fabrics and materials, ensuring a more comfortable and durable experience. \n- Moreover, ready-to-wear pieces will be meticulously designed with silhouette, fit, and proportion in mind, providing a better overall fit and feel. **The versatility of ready-to-wear clothing makes it easy for consumers to incorporate these pieces into their daily wardrobe**, as they offer a range of styles that can be easily mixed and matched.\n\n\n## **WHAT DOES A CC0 CLOTHING BRAND LOOK LIKE?**\n- We believe that wears‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®.wtf has the potential to innovate in fashion by leveraging CC0 assets to create unique and innovative clothing designs. \n- By incorporating elements from various web3 projects and the broader public domain, wears.wtf can develop a diverse range of apparel that reflects the creative spirit of the internet and empowers individuals to express their unique identities.\n- As Nouns allows for this CC0-POWERED clothing brand, integration and collaboration with other artists, brands, and CC0 projects can lead to outstanding success by exploring a niche with a format that no one is currently exploring. \n\n\n## **TIMELINE [PROOF-OF-DEMAND]**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CqaF99V.png)\n*TOTAL 26 WEEKS*\n*AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE: EARLY NOVEMBER*\n\n\n## **PHASE 2: [PRODUCTION EXPANSION]** \n- The subsequent proposal will focus on funding a larger production and adopting a more targeted approach, informed by the metrics gathered during this initial phase. All profits generated in this first phase will be reinvested by wears.wtf to minimize expenses required for execution.\n    - In this phase, we'll develop NOUNSSENTIALS, NOUNSWEAR, and NOUNSJACKETS in collection sizes that meet the growing demand. \n    - After Phase 2, wears.wtf will be a self-sustainable project that proudly represents its origins in Nouns. \n        - After developing all Nounish lines, we'll then be open to explore collaborations with other communities like Cryptoadz, Checks, Opepen, CryptoDickButts, Mfers, Rektguy, etc. \n\n- As crypto, NFTs, and Web3 continue to grow, so will our consumer base. Together with LEBLANCSTUDIOS, we're dedicated to creating high-quality products that people will love not just for the designs, but for the quality as well.\n\n***Wears.wtf aims to establish itself as a valuable platform powered by Nouns, with the goal of creating a long-term project that benefits not only the Nouns ecosystem but also the broader web3 community.***\n\n## **BUDGET** \n![](https://i.imgur.com/UMjOx50.png)\n\n*Budget for phase 2 will be measurable once we have all of the metrics that will be provided by this first proposal.*",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 282 - Dynamic Quorum Updates",
      "content": "# Dynamic Quorum Updates\n\n**Author: [Nounlius](https://twitter.com/nounlius)**\n**TL;DR - reduce max quorum from 20% to 15%**\n\n**Dynamic Quorum Parameter Updates**\nAs articulated in this [detailed post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE), three parameters need to be set for dynamic quorum.\n\n**CURRENT SETTINGS**\nMinimum quorum %: currently set to 10%\nMaximum quorum %: currently set to 20%\nCoefficient: currently set to 1, such that each against vote raises the quorum requirement by one vote, until the maximum quorum is reached.\n\n**PROPOSED SETTINGS**\nMinimum quorum %: 10% (no change)\nMaximum quorum %: set to 15%\nCoefficient: 1 (no change)\n\n**RATIONALE**\n\n[Prop 261](https://nouns.wtf/vote/261) recently adjusted Dynamic Quorum to ensure only \"Hell Yes\" proposals are executed. The stated rationale was the following\n\n> 1. Dynamic quorum was designed so that contentious proposals would require a higher degree of support.\n> 2. Maximum quorum is currently too low to have changed the outcome of any recent proposals.\n> 3. Increasing maximum quorum should increase the percentage of successful proposals that are \"hell yes\" initiatives.\n\nWhat appears to be conveniently left out is the \"Why\" behind [Dynamic Quorum](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE): which was to protect the DAO from voter apathy as an attack vector in an effort to move the DAO one step closer to removing the veto.\n\nThe recent change is a misuse of this DAO parameter to serve a particular point of view. As Wilson Cusack [pointed out](https://twitter.com/WilsonCusack/status/1644338325908606976/photo/1), functionally speaking Dynamic Quorum serves to privilege against votes. \n\nGenerally speaking, contentious proposals lead to higher voter turnout. There may be a case to be made that setting Dynamic Quorum to 0 would incentivize higher voter participation and/or delegation‚Äîwhich would increase DAO health. The inverse may also be true, the higher the dynamic quorum the less incentive there is to participate on the margins given the increases barrier to successful proposals‚Äîwhich reduces DAO health.\n\nThis proposal will revert to *Maximum Quorum's* original setting of 15%, meanwhile encouraging further discussion on whether or not to remove the Dynamic Quorum altogether.\n\n**PROPOSAL TRANSACTIONS**\n_setDynamicQuorumParams: sets dynamic quorum params to:\n\nMinimum quorum BPs: 10% (1000 basis points) (no change).\nMaximum quorum BPs: 15% (1500 basis points).\nCoefficient: 1 (1,000,000 in unsigned integer with 6 decimal places) (no change).",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 281 - Introducing Noun Computers",
      "content": "# Introducing Noun Computers\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BibDiu5.png)\n\n## TL;DR\n- Noun-Computers and Noun-Breadbook are innovative, affordable, and state-of-the-art devices that would be used by generations of software and hardware developers.\n- Noun-Computers will be much more versatile and convenient than raspberry pi and arduino boards. I will design circuits, PCBs, and interfaces from scratch.\n- The electrical components will be arranged in the shape of Noggles\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wMkKAC9.png)\n- **[Public Good]** Allocate **30%** of supply will be allocated to Nouns-Computer fund. Any nouner will be able to request computers via an on-chain proposal and send it for Public Good to developing countries, minority groups, or other purposes.\n- **[Onboarding]** Sponsor ETH Hackathons by providing 400 Noun-Computer kits for competitions. By onboarding and growing a community of developers at ETH global hackathons, we will be able to find the next 1,000 nouners\n- **[Proliferation]** By investing in technology and innovation NounsDAO will be able to take advantage of new proliferation opportunities. For example, we can bring Noun-Computers to **CES**, **ETH Hackathons**, and maybe even go to **Shark Tank** to raise additional investments.\n    - Partner with ETH global hackathons by providing Noun-Computers for hardware competitions\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/YasYd13.png)\n    - Showcase Noun-Computers at CES, the most prestigious consumer electronics show\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/Dhf4aCL.png)\n    - Raise additional capital from investors (Shark Tank etc) and put Noun-Computers into every school, university, and mall\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/IGjeKq4.png)\n\n\n## Description\nI propose to grow a community of software and hardware developers around Noun-Computers and Noun-Breadbook (aka breadboard). Elegance, versatility, and performance are the three things that make a good single-board computer. Noun-Computers will be much more versatile and convenient than raspberry pi and arduino boards Noun-Computers will enable people to work on much bigger and more ambitious projects thanks to an innovative Noun-breadbook (a reinvented breadboard). The Breadbook is a new type of device that would replace outdated breadboards and allow developers to arrange software and hardware setups more cleanly and understandably. I propose to apply for a few patents and trademarks and later give everyone open access to the inventions if needed.\n\nThe Noun-Devices will be available in the $40-$60 price range and distributed strictly using a fixed price policy to ensure that the end users do not overpay. The money from sales will be used to further proliferate NounsDAO by introducing more devices, modules, books, and tutorials. All future products will be branded and aligned with the nounish culture.\n\nNounsDAO can **sponsor ETH Hackathons** by providing the first 400 Noun-Computer kits. Also, 30% of the supply will be allocated to **Nouns-Computer Fund** any nouner will be able to request computers for **Public Good** via an on-chain proposal and send it to developing countries, minority groups, or other purposes.\n\nWe can bring NounsDAO to **Consumer Electronic Show (CES**) where we will have an opportunity to talk with big companies and media outlets about how NounsDAO builds an internet government, growth a global community of talented people, enables multidisciplinary collaborations, and funds cool projects with a meaningful impact on the future such as Noun-Computers. We can show the world innovative devices that will be used at universities, schools, and indie projects around the world.\n\n## The problem\n![](https://i.imgur.com/g7sIhYL.png)\n\nHow can we reach new communities and establish a sustainable proliferation model for NounsDAO? My idea is to grow a community of software and hardware developers around new, affordable, and innovative Noun-Computers. Noun-Computers will win the hearts and minds of developers by improving the software and hardware prototyping experience.\n- **[Price and Availability]** Schools and universities do not use a single-board computer in their curriculum due to price inconsistency. For example, raspberry pi 4 boards are advertised to cost $70 but you are never able to buy them at that price. The market price for raspberry pi 4 is over $160. By manufacturing Noun-Computers, we can prevent any price speculations and make truly affordable and widely available single-board computers.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Oqo5Ojb.png)\n\n- **[Versatility & Capability]** \nThe Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook would be very intuitive and easy to use. A well-selected combination of features, interfaces and elements placement on the board would allow to free the working space for other elements/modules. The Noun-Computers performance will be enough to run ETH staking node, run deep learning and computer vision applications. The Noun-Computer will be a size of a credit card that can work as a stand-alone device or with a Noun-Breadbook. We are going to fit the following features:\n    - AM62Ax Sitara, Arm Cortex-A53 1.4 GHz\n    - M.2 ports x2 for SSD, GPS modules expansion\n    - MicroSD x1\n    - Bluetooth & WiFi\n    - Ethernet\n    - 40-pin GPIO Header\n    - USB-C x3 for power, tethered connection, peripherals, monitor, etc\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R0Ol8Uo.png)\n- **[Aesthetic]** Existing single-board computers use ports and dongles (HDMI, ethernet, USB) that raise the cost, limit portability, and result in bad aesthetics. Custom simple boards (microcontroller based) give you better aesthetics but limited functionality. Likewise, Custom Systems (CPU based) would have good aesthetics and capability but are too expensive to design for individuals. Noun-Computers would allow greater flexibility in developing tidy electronic prototypes with custom expansion boards that feature USB-C ports, plug-in card connectors, and digital pins. Below is an image of breadboard-based setups. One of the core problems is that the breadboard-based prototyping setups are not portable, clumsy, and difficult to keep in one piece hence you can't work on your great ideas from a coffee shop or take your work to a class. Likewise, it is hard to use breadboard-based projects to explain your software and hardware ideas in a concise, precise, and understandable manner. The breadboard was invented back in the 1880s and there was no innovation in the breadboard design in the past 143 years! ([\"Electrical Switch board\"](https://patents.google.com/patent/US231708A)).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4PX7sxT.png)\n\n## Noun-Computer\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wMkKAC9.png)\nNoun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook are new devices that provide a foundation for inexpensive software and hardware prototyping. Noun-Devices will enable any developer to build clean, portable, and good-looking hardware prototypes that work. We will be able to reach and educate millions of developers around the globe and build nounish dev communities. With Noun-Computers, NounsDAO will win the hearts and minds of developers. All the devices will be designed to be best in performance, price, and user experience categories.\n\nThe Noun-Computer will compete in performance and price with raspberry pi and arduino boards. The devices will be sold via a fixed price policy to ensure that end users do not overpay.\nThe Noun-Devices will cost $40-$60. Similar devices on the market are advertised as cheap but usually sold for $100~$160. The money from sales will be used to introduce more nounish devices, books, tutorials, and sponsor eth hackathons.\n\nAll documentation, tutorials, and books will use nouns assets as well as electrical components on the computer boards will be arranged in the form of noggles.\n\n## Noun-Breadbook\nNoun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook are new devices that work together and provide a fundamentally new way to work on software and hardware projects. Noun-Breadbook is a reinvented breadboard and my original idea and I would love to work with NounsDAO to bring this game-changing device to life. The key to success is to make Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook complement each other and work together as one modular system. I believe that Noun-Devices will be widely accepted at universities, schools, startups, and indie dev. It is an expensive project but has a great return on investment and will be a sustainable way to proliferate NounsDAO. We can put Nouns to [Consumer Electronic Show](https://www.ces.tech/) in Las Vegas and generate a lot of positive exposure to NounDAO through press and tv.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MMmpIQq.png)\nThe Noun-Breadbook will replace old breadboards allowing easy connection of modules to a Noun-Computer. The pages will be available in different configurations that would increase the versatility of the whole system. The breadbook binder will be made from aluminum. The main function of the binder is to connect pages, supply power, and connect the board to ports such as HDMI, USB-C, and AUDIO.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/USOoae5.png)\nThe pages of the Noun-Breadbook would be assembled from layers of paper, encapsulation, cathode, and anode. The pages are going to provide a base for soldering components. The pages will be flexible and made using technology used in the production of flexible displays. The Noun-Breadbook will be lightweight and flexible to enable compact design and portability.\n\nI have been working in academia for a long time and know that new devices such as Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook would significantly improve user experience and inspire people to work on bigger and more ambitious projects.\n\n## Using Noun-Breadbook as an interactive textbook\nAn interactive book based on Noun-Breadbook will be the most nounish book in academia, period! The design of Noun-Computer and Breadbook would allow people to work on creative projects. For example, users will be able to use blank pages to document their work and development progress. Likewise, users will be able to share their work by sharing printable breadbooks. Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook would be appreciated by universities and schools around the globe. It is also possible that in the future the Breadbook would be adopted as a learning platform by Computer Science and Engineering schools.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fr00zAZ.jpg)\nHere are the photos of how the Noun-Computer and Noun-breadbook would enhance user experience.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Nhe3Hz3.jpg)\nThe pages can be used to give instructions to a user.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lFKpnUB.jpg)\nI will write a book with five complete tutorials that will teach how to develop applications for cameras, graphics, networks, I/O interfaces, and servo controllers. For example, a Camera Lab would like something like this where you can learn everything you need to know to develop applications from scratch. In this Lab, you will learn about the implementation and design patterns of camera applications. For example: take photos and videos; object/face tracking; mapping environment\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0yUM0xL.jpg)\nThis Lab will teach you everything you need to know to program computer graphics from scratch. In this Lab, you will learn about the implementation and design patterns of beautiful UI and animations.\n\n## Deliverables\n- Sponsor ETH Hackathons, and provide 400 Noun-Computer kits for competitions\n- Donate 30% of supply to developing countries and minority groups\n- Photo & Video report every month on the state of the progress\n- Invention patents (to be released for open access)\n- Booths at Consumer Electronic Show & Mobile World Congress\n- Guest Lectures at 20 Universities around the globe\n- A Noun-Computer will be available in the $40-$60 price range\n- A Blank Noun-Breadbook will be available in the $50-$70 price range\n- An Interactive Noun-Breadbook will be available in the $90 - $130 price range\n\nThe money from sales of the devices will be used to support future development and manufacturing.\n\n## Outsourcing companies\nI have many years of experience working with two great companies KS Technology and Hansaem digitec.\n- KS Technology https://altium.kr/\n- Hansaem digitec https://www.hsdgt.com/main/main.html\n\n## Timeline\n**Phase I&II - Prototypes v0.1~1 (4 months)**\nNowadays, the development and manufacturing of a single-board computer might be trivial given the available knowledge. However, the challenge is to design a perfect combination of single board computer and breadbook layout that would give people the freedom to build creative circuits and prototypes.\n- [May~Aug 2023] Manufacture and test first 100 Noun-Computer prototypes\n- [Sep 2023] Sponsor ETH global hackathon NY by providing Noun-Computers for hardware competitions\n\n**Phase III - Mass Manufacturing (5 months)**\nMass manufacturing of Noun-Computer devices would require the development of manufacturing methods, safety approvals, quality control tests, etc. Manufacturing is a difficult process and it would be best to outsource it to a third-party company. There are a lot of companies that manufacture PCBs and electronic devices in Korea. We just need to invest time and money into developing requirements, manufacturing methods, and quality control.\n- [Sep~Oct 2023] Prototype v2\n- [Nov 2023] Mass production\n- [Jan 2024] Showcase Noun-Computers and Noun-Breadbook at CES and MWC, two of the most prestigious consumer electronics shows\n\n**Phase IV - Proliferation**\nThe proliferation phase is the time when the NounsDAO will be able to harvest fruits from its investment. We will bring NounsDAO to CES, where we alongside with most innovative companies. I will personally visit 10+ universities and give guest lectures and master classes on Noun-Computer and Noun-Breadbook. I will write an Interactive book based on Noun-Breadbook that will be used for ages to come.\n- Raise additional capital from investors (Shark tank) and put Noun-Computers in schools, universities, and malls around the US.\n\n## About me\nTwitter: [fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/five\n\n\n---\n\nTHIS PROP IS LONGER THAN THE MAX LENGTH FOR SNAPSHOT:\n\n Read the rest of the prop at https://nouns.wtf/vote/281",

Let's name our recently acquired jellyfish Noun 687: **JellO** on NFTR.\n\n## Background\n\n[NFTR](https://nftr.name) (pronounced Nifter) stands for NFTRegistry. Founded by Nouner [DigitalOil](https://digitaloil.nftr.name), NFTR is the NFT identity protocol on Ethereum.\n\nIdentity starts with **naming**; kind of like ENS but for NFTs instead of wallets. \n\nFeatures launching soon: \n\n1. NFT <> NFT messaging\n2. NFT Banking (send money between NFTs)\n3. Name marketplace (trade NFT names)\n\nFeatures launching later:\n\n1. Social NFTs\n2. NFT on-chain history and news feeds\n\nThanks to [Prop 268](https://nouns.wtf/vote/268) we were able to directly bid on and win a Noun.\n\n![Noun 687 soon to have a name](https://i.ibb.co/0QXGxb3/Untitled.png)\nNoun 687 soon to have a name\n\nSince our Noun lies in our treasury, we can name it via an on-chain prop.\n\n## Naming Noun 687: JellO\n\nNFTR has assigned a naming credit to the Nouns Treasury so naming JellO is *free*.\n\nI touched upon the idea of naming 687 and Nouner [Supriyo](https://twitter.com/next_roy) suggested the name JellO, which was well received by other Nouners.\n\n## Currently Named Nouns\n\nAt the moment, 6 Nouns are named on NFTR.\n\nLet‚Äôs name JellO so that it joins the club and gets its own NFTR domain (.nftr) and profile page accesible by name:\n\nJellO.nftr.name\n\n![Nouns currently named on NFTR](https://i.ibb.co/hdBz0fZ/Untitled-1.png)\nNouns currently named on NFTR\n\n![Example NFTR profile page](https://i.ibb.co/44VFy8X/Untitled-2.png)\nExample NFTR profile page\n\nThat‚Äôs all folks!",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 279 - ethOS: A crypto-native, mobile OS",
      "content": "# ethOS: A crypto-native, mobile OS\n\n### **TLDR:**\nApple and Google are holding back Web3 mobile development.\n\nethOS is a free and **open source** mobile OS that embraces Ethereum and makes Web3 delightful on mobile.\n\nWe've been building ethOS as a public good for more than a year (currently at ethOS v2.1) without any funding.\n\nCurrently, using ethOS requires flashing an older Pixel.\n\nWe‚Äôd love NounsDAO's support in the launch of a turn-key, consumer friendly ethOS device.\n\n### **Who are we?**\n\nethOS is a group of nine developers and designers passionate about Ethereum and Web3 who have been building it since winter of 2021.\n\n[@mk](https://warpcast.com/mk) (markkat.eth, Noun 191) wrote the [ŒûPhone Manifesto](https://discord.com/channels/910934588073840700/916441442514272327) in 12/22 which kick-started ethOS. He remains an ethOS co-founder. [@markus](https://warpcast.com/markus) (mhaas.eth, https://nf.td/markus)  is also a co-founder and leads development for ethOS. Team ethOS consists of multiple founders, YC Alum, and members with significant Web3 industry experience.\n\nOur website: [ethosmobile.org](https://ethosmobile.org)\n\n![EthOS Render](https://i.ibb.co/wsP4cTC/Clean-Shot-2023-04-27-at-20-51-41-2x.png)\n\n### **Why are we building ethOS?**\n\nEthereum on mobile is nerfed by gatekeepers. Most consumer internet activity occurs on mobile devices. However, Android and iOS treat Ethereum as just another application, rather than the protocol that underpins Web3. For example, the iOS OpenSea app doesn‚Äôt let you buy, sell, or even _send_ NFTs, because [Apple wants a cut of Ethereum gas fees.](https://fortune.com/crypto/2022/12/01/coinbase-apple-30-percent-fee-digital-wallet/) Uniswap has created an iOS wallet that Apple didn‚Äôt approve for months, and [they don‚Äôt know why](https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1631691337845075968). Furthermore, the Web3 user experience is terrible. Using Ethereum dapps on mobile means browsing within a wallet, and bouncing back and forth between the wallet and the web app. This also prevents new interaction models (such as pay-as-you-stream streaming for audio NFTs). [Apple also does not allow token-gated features](https://decrypt.co/112804/apple-clarifies-app-store-rules-barring-nft-utility-external-purchase-links). Android and iOS are permissioned platforms by design, and this hinders Web3 development. By offering a meaningful alternative, we can push these companies to adopt Ethereum, or lose market share.\n\nethOS fully embraces Ethereum to unlock the full potential of Web3. ethOS features an onboard Ethereum light node and a System level wallet, allowing for direct interaction between mobile applications and Ethereum, and giving users more security and control over their assets. Unlike iOS and Android, ethOS doesn‚Äôt own the App Store. In the spirit of Web3, ethOS supports competition and composability among apps services.\n\n### **Where are we at?**\n\nWe launched ethOS v2.0 at ETH Denver 2023, and released ethOS v2.1 last month. We have been building continuously since December 2021. Despite not taking any funding, we maintain a rapid pace of development, and have a long list of exciting functionality and features to bring to ethOS. Some of the cool features of ethOS available today include:\n\n**Onboard light node**\n- No need for centralized RPC services pre-merge. Post-merge it gets data from a centralized RPC, but verifies the data using beaconchain data.\n- Less man-in-the-middle risk\n- Further decentralizes access to Ethereum in the future using the Portal Network\n\n**System-level wallet** \n - Approves transactions without leaving the browser or app\n - Removes the need for the centralized WalletConnect service\n\n**NFT minting from Gallery/Camera**\n - Create an NFT in seconds\n\n**XMTP messaging**\n - Decentralized messaging between Ethereum or ENS addresses\n\n**ENS integration**\n - Contacts leverage ENS\n\n**Private Key Management via Secure Enclave**\n - Private key is encrypted using symmetric key stored on SPU\n\n**Biometric signing of transactions**\n - Sign a transaction in-app or in-browser with your fingerprint, without having to switch over to the wallet\n\n**Android apps and Services**\n - Install all apps available in the Google Play Store and get traditional Google Play Services for your Android apps\n\n**Three Browser**\n - A full web browser integrated with the system wallet for seamless signing\n\nHere‚Äôs swapping on Uniswap on ethOS:\n[https://youtu.be/3PiMTGq3i-A](https://youtu.be/3PiMTGq3i-A)\n\nHere‚Äôs minting an NFT on ethOS:\n[https://youtu.be/edVpdWwq-6A](https://youtu.be/edVpdWwq-6A)\n\n### **The Purpose of this Proposal**\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to ask for a grant that allows us to launch ethOS devices for anyone to purchase.\n\nCurrently, users have to jump through a lot of hoops to try out ethOS. We and our community have been building and testing ethOS on out-of-date devices (Pixel3, 3XL, and 5a). This has enabled us and our community to get devices at a low cost, but it is not a model for widespread adoption. To use ethOS today, users must find and buy used devices, and they must be OEM unlocked (many are incorrectly labeled). This is a major impediment to adoption.\n\nethOS is now ready for the Web3 community at large, and we are going to make it available pre-installed on current Pixel 7s. To make this happen, we must update ethOS to be compatible with Pixel 7s (a development lift), and establish a delightful sales and quality distribution process (orders on website, sourcing of devices, installation of ethOS, branding/boxing, and fulfillment). Most costs associated with achieving this are for sourcing devices, packing materials, shipping, laser-etching, and developer time.\n\nOur team has worked unpaid thus far; however, three of our developers will be transitioning to a paid status as we begin to sell and support a consumer-grade device. With full time engineers, we can build even faster, and better support the growing ethOS developer community.\n\nThis is an important time in the evolution of ethOS, and funding would greatly assist us in this transition.\n\n### **What‚Äôs in it for Nouns?**\n\nWe believe that building an open source, mobile operating system as a public good is a very Nounish goal. Everyone in the Ethereum ecosystem is aware of the negative effect that Apple and Google gate-keeping has on Web3 mobile. ethOS represents a critical effort to unlock the potential of Ethereum on mobile, and to increase Ethereum adoption.\n\nOur first ethOS device will also have a Nounish option! To thank Nouns for their support, purchasers of the ethOS phone can choose the Nounish Edition, which feature generative Nounish wallpaper, a Noggle-sporting ethOS logo etched on the back of their device, and Nounish packaging to deliver a delightful experience for the user. It will look something like this:\n\n![Nouns Edition](https://i.ibb.co/K5nNQKc/Clean-Shot-2023-04-27-at-21-08-46-2x.png)\n\nWe will also prominently thank Nouns for their support on our website and in our social channels for providing the necessary public goods funding for the first ethOS phone.\n\n### **Why we are submitting a Proposal**\n\nWe believe that ethOS can be supported in a Web3 native manner that is consistent with the goals of a free and open-source operating system that embraces Ethereum. We have not taken any venture funding to date for this reason. A grant from Nouns would greatly help us advance our mission at this critical time. Furthermore, support from Nouns would raise awareness for ethOS.\n\n### **The Ask and Deliverable**\nWe are asking for 40 eth (~ $76k) in funding delivered at 0x55A4E5123F8923500fF7AA97e75231a54A9c233a.\n\nWe will make the ethOS phone available for purchase in Summer 2023.\n\nThank you kindly for your consideration,\nTeam ethOS\n",

It is a free mint and Zora is donating their $1 fee to the [Gitcoin Crypto Advocacy Round](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/1/0x32c49d2da5f6866a057e4aa2058c62a2974a5623).\n\nThe mint has taken off, with over 46k minted at the time of writing. Many people on Twitter are minting and tweeting about it to signal solidarity. The mint amount leaderboard has become a sort of signaling contest, with the top 8 currently \n\n- kames.eth ‚Ä¢ 2024 items\n- context.app ‚Ä¢ 2000 items\n- zapper.eth ‚Ä¢ 1200 items\n- rk6.eth ‚Ä¢ 1200 items\n- m.jesse.xyz ‚Ä¢ 1100 items\n- moonwelldefi.eth ‚Ä¢ 1000 items\n- kevin0x4a.eth ‚Ä¢ 1000 items\n- villagechief.eth ‚Ä¢ 300 items\n\nWe are proposing\n1. Nouns DAO attempt to claim the top spot on the leaderboard by minting 5k of the \"Stand with Crypto\" NFT.\n2. Nouns DAO donate 55 ETH‚Äì$103k at time of writing‚Äìto the Gitcoin Crypto Advocacy round, doubling the current matching grant. (Funds will be sent to the [Gitcoin multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6).) \n\nNote, the Gitcoin round will be concluded by the time this proposal could be executed, but we have been in touch with the Gitcoin team and they are happy to make it work: payouts will happen with some delay after the round is over, so our funds can easily be added to the matching pool. (The matching funds will be allocated at the end of the round to the grantees based on the level of support they all received during the round. More details on matching [here](https://wtfisqf.com/?grant=&grant=&grant=&grant=&match=1000).)\n\n## Why \n- Because it is a good thing to do: It is a crucial time for crypto, from a regulatory perspective. The work being done by the organizations in this Gitcoin round is important and we all benefit from it. We also help by signaling our support and raising awareness of the effort. \n- Because it is Nounish: we see generosity and funding things that benefit the crypto community, at large, as core Nounish values. \n- Because it is good for Nouns DAO: giving money to support crypto helps us build good will in the crypto community and attract community members who want to buy a Noun, or join the community generally, because they want to be a part of supporting similar work. There is also significant attention on this mint right now, and the mint amount \"leaderboard,\" and we see this as a unique timely marketing opportunity. \n\nThanks for your time :) ",

This is an opportunity to create a low-cost, yet highly sought after and unique piece of hardware that fits in your pocket and carried daily with you. From conversation starters in person to unboxings and showing off on social media, this device is sleek, a standout, and an instant proliferator.\n\n[![NOUNS-PROP-GIF.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/d3NKdZM3/NOUNS-PROP-GIF.gif)](https://postimg.cc/y3R5Cd8C)\n\nMy speciality is creating exceptional and memorable digital and physical experiences through a variety of mediums (i.e. installations, hardware, web, 3D, etc.) working with notable brands such as my ongoing partnerships with Arduino; building conceptual prototypes, fashion brands such as Christopher Kane and Selfridges, and most recently, creating an [exclusive audio-reactive hardware for Zora](https://twitter.com/____zine____/status/1651233581723779078?s=20) (under [Lychee, Inc](https://lychee.vision/) - company I cofounded).\n\nWith 58k followers across my socials where 90% are avid hardware enthusiasts, there‚Äôs an exciting opportunity to introduce and build a new branch of applicability to Nouns via the Noggles LED hardware device and its CC0 files, giving them a new tool to develop firmware, create physical nounish projects and iterate further.\n\nExplorer Grants has led me here and I think there‚Äôs a lot more that Nouns and I can do together to create beautiful nounish objects, art pieces, experiences and more! Having a shared vision to build in the public domain; to open source for more creativity, collaboration and innovation ‚Äì I think by embracing Nouns and my unique pov as an artist, we can produce captivating nounish creations that showcase the best of both our perspectives and amplify our collective creativity. To leave not only lasting impressions, but the foundational blocks to build upon further and allow other people‚Äôs creativity to flourish!\n\n---\n\n## TLDR\n\n- Requesting 75Œû (across 6 months with *__~18.5% return__* if all units sold):\n    - **Fund the development and production of 600 Artisanal Noggles LED keychains**\n        - 50 units of Supply to the DAO + 100% Profit / Mint Revenue to the DAO\n        - 50 units used for gifting, raffles, etc. ‚Üí for marketing purposes\n        - 500 units available to mint / purchase *__for 0.025ETH__*\n        - Costs for building hardware, prototypes, designing enclosure, packaging, firmware dev and liaising with manufacturers to source production deals with suppliers\n        - Build Website to purchase: front-end & back-end with custom NFT + smart contract\n            - include all open-source files and development of the 6 nounish projects I‚Äôve made during Explorer Grants\n    - **Marketing ‚Üí via my socials [@tigrisli](https://www.tiktok.com/@tigrisli)**\n        - Create TikTok / Reel content with ‚Äúmaking of video‚Äù and ‚Äúhow to make‚Äù\n        - High distribution ‚Üí potential of reaching *+100,000 viewers from my socials*\n        - My audience: *90% hardware enthusiasts and creative engineers (direct marketing + distribution)*\n            - Show hardware enthusiasts and DIY electronics builders that they can build with Nouns, embody the brand‚Äôs identity and fuel their own creativity, *with Nouns!*\n                - Bring new applicability of Nouns to hardware engineers ‚Üí developing nounish hardware and firmware\n        - [My Media Kit](https://files.cargocollective.com/c1344327/TIGRIS-MediaKit.pdf) - Overall Stats:\n            - **Total Followers: 58k**\n            - **Total Video Views: 10.7M**\n            - **Engagement Rate: 39.9%**\n    - CC0 everything ‚Üí code, hardware, schematics will be open-sourced so anyone is able to reproduce the keychain themselves ‚Üí all files will be available in public domain\n\n---\n\n## Proposal\n\nI was first funded by Explorer Grants ([prop 178](https://nouns.wtf/vote/178)) and took the opportunity to create 6 experimental hardware pieces: [a Nouns Governance Wallet](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1631322679172112384?s=20), [USB E-Ink Displaying Daily Nouns & Props](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1625883686561275905?s=20), [Etch-A-Sketch](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1624120919152001040?s=20), [Noggles LED Keychain](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1645788540499025920?s=20), [Noggles Speakers](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1637133435549495297?s=20), and the [Nouns Camera](https://twitter.com/tigrisli/status/1646167941178703872?s=20).\n\nOne of these objects stood apart from the rest and got a lot of attention on Twitter. The desire to own a unique Noggles LED Keychain led me directly to create this proposal.\n\nNouns has the opportunity to lead the way in creating unique hardware-based artwork that many people want to own; setting new standards for innovation and creativity, that aren‚Äôt only visually stunning by highly coveted by collectors and enthusiasts alike.\n\nWith my strong social presence and commitment to open-source content, I believe I can help reinforce the Nouns brand beyond crypto. Directly through my own brand; in addition of building conceptual hardware and art installations I document videos of those builds that reach over 58,000 followers and have amassed a combined total of +10.7 million video views with a 39.9% engagement rate.\n\n**Why the Noggles LED Keychain?**\n\n- Daily-carry item, it‚Äôs an effective means of promoting Nouns and serves as an important signifier and physical representation of the Nouns identity. Its power is in its subtle daily constant that‚Äôs unavoidably carried everywhere - making it a strong means of connecting people with the Nouns community.\n- *Daily signifier ‚Üí instant proliferator*\n- Affordability ‚Üí low costs\n    - Estimated purchase price: ~$50 (0.025Œû)\n\n**Hardware Specs:**\n- Array of 78 RGB LEDs\n- Customized pattern animations (firmware)\n- Button to alternate between the patterns\n- Rechargeable lithium battery via USB-C\n\n[![LED-KEYCHAIN.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/GmhydZKj/LED-KEYCHAIN.gif)](https://postimg.cc/gnQJKtfw)\n\n---\n\n# Who **For?**\nI have a high niche community of hardware enthusiasts (Instagram + TikTok) and people in Crypto (Twitter) ‚Äì I think these Noggle LED Keychains will perfectly hit both demographics, especially as it will all be open-source.\n\n- **Nouners + Nouns Community**\n    - this is an artisanal nounish object, a beautifully designed novelty item\n    - a tangible semiotic Nouns device that you can carry with you daily and fits in the palm of one‚Äôs hand\n    - direct symbol and ‚Äúshow‚Äù of being part of the Nouns community\n- **Hardware Enthusiasts**\n    - Typical RGB LED add-ons for Arduino / Raspberry Pi can cost upwards of $50, but the Noggles LED Keychain offers an affordable alternative with a programmable ATTINY85 chip and x78 compact RGB LEDs\n    - Designed with CC0 and for hacking / tinkering, Noggles LEDs provide hardware enthusiasts the opportunity to evolve the code and proliferate Nouns by applying it to their own projects, including larger hardware projects such as IoT and the application of sensors.\n        - new applicability of Nouns ‚Üí developing nounish firmware\n    - Show hardware enthusiasts and DIY electronics builders that they can build with Nouns, embody the brand‚Äôs identity and fuel their own creativity, *with Nouns*\n    - Hardware builders and creative engineers are well-positioned to explore exciting possibilities of crypto, but haven‚Äôt been shown ways of getting involved. I think with the Noggles LED Keychain (and other Nounish hardware) we can bridge this gap and show them what‚Äôs possible!\n    - ******3D Printing Enthusiasts / Product Designers (sub-group typically part of hardware builders)******\n        - CC0 enclosure files enables engineers and designers to create their own unique versions of the Noggles enclosure with a variety of materials and customizing it to their liking\n        - This opens up new opportunities for creative evolution, allowing engineers to physically make their own nounish objects and explore new design possibilities\n\nThe proposal includes the development to build, design and prototype the ***Noggles LED Keychain*** with a production run of 600 units- working with manufacturers and liaising with suppliers to meet industry standards and construct the PCB circuit from scratch, complete with a custom software and firmware that will be open-sourced, and a designed enclosure with custom packaging - all to go into production with a custom website for purchasing.\n\nTo bring the **Noggles LED Keychain** to market, the project will be divided into 6 stages over a 6 month period, with a total cost of 75Œû to cover production, design costs, prototyping iterations, hardware components, material costs, material sourcing, labour, etc.\n\n---\n\n## **An overview of the steps to build the Noggles LED Keychain**\n\n1. **PCB Circuit Design**: This involves R&D for components, block diagrams, MCUs, preliminary design, schematic design, and PCB layout design. I'll also create multiple prototypes for testing\n    - Already in progress, currently on Prototype‚ÄìV2, will need to iterate and adjust minor circuit design + components; at least 1-3 more prototypes to reach finalized design\n2. **Software / Firmware**: This includes coding the firmware to run the circuit, integrating the firmware with the hardware, and testing and debugging the product\n    - 90% complete - tweaking and evolving design patterns\n3. **Enclosure Design**: Create mockup sketches, conduct research and ideation, develop 3D models and CAD designs, and source materials and manufacturers for the enclosure.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 276 - Nounish Playground - The Game",
      "content": "# Nounish Playground - The Game\n\n# Nounish Playground - The Game\n\n## TL;DR:\nWe're proposing to build a mobile platformer game with 700 levels in which we introduce players to nounish concepts and educate them on Nouns DAO and adjacent extensions while playing through fun and engaging maps. While the total budget required to complete the game development is $200,000, we are seeking funding of **$90,000** for the alpha version, which will include an **early access** release. The alpha version is expected to take 6 months to complete, followed by an additional 6 months until the final release. Once the alpha version is released, we will require the remaining budget to complete the development of the game.\n\n---\n\n## Description\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/egqCNYh.jpg)\n\n**Click on the image to view the proposed game design.**\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/j38RqEz.jpg)\n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toY9TC21gyQ)\n\n\n---\n### The game is divided into two parts:\n- Single Player\n- Multiplayer\n\n### Single Player\nThe single-player mode is a platformer game.\n\nIn this mode the player controls their noun to reach its destination - to be minted and sent to auction at **Nouns DAO**.\n\nThere is a unique level for each noun minted, designed with various obstacles and challenges.\n\nWe as a nounish family are waiting every day to see what the next noun will look like and how much the winning bid is at the auction for the previous noun, but we don't know anything about each noun‚Äôs background story. We don't know what a noun has been through before it gets minted! This concept was the inspiration for this game.\n\n### Getting to know **Nounish culture**\n\nSome stages of the game are designed to indirectly teach players about the Nounish culture and the **NounsDAO** mechanism. Players will be enticed to go through these stages in order to obtain valuable rewards, and in the process, they will come across learning opportunities to grasp these concepts. We believe that direct teaching of these concepts might not be engaging for players, so we aim to make the learning experience more fun and interactive through gameplay.\n\n**Click on the picture below to see the video**üëá\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/GjT0Tiw.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lclo8l3t_g)\n\n#### Gameplay\nThe player controls their noun throughout each level in a 3D playground. Nouns can run, jump, grab, climb, dive + more to overcome the obstacles until the final point is reached and the noun goes through the gate to get minted.\n\nThere is ether on the path that the player must collect to meet the goal. The goal amount of ether is set based on how much that noun sold for at auction.\n\nAfter completing each level, the player is awarded three stars. The first star is just for completing the level and the second one is awarded if the count of collected ether has reached the winning bid amount and the last star is awarded based on the time spent completing the level.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wgcyHFh.gif)\n\n\nFor example: The first level is about Noun 1 being minted and the player will have to guide the noun through the course while collecting enough ether to meet the winning bid on that noun, while trying to do it in the fastest time possible.\n\n**Click on the pictures below to watch an example of the Noun 1 & 2 levels of the game üëá**\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/b8ymd4i.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz-ouU8xErE)\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/06KwPXg.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YxpdSb2iYo)\n\n### Multiplayer\nIn this mode of the game, players enter a battle royal like Fall Guys and compete with one another.\n\nEach session starts with 40 players and three matches are held in each session. At the end of each match, only half of the players walk it through, then at the end of the third match, the final player wins the match.\n\nThe game and environment design is nounish and each level/match has its own unique theme based on nounish extensions such as lil nouns, Gnars DAO, Alps DAO, and many others where spectators are members of these communities.\n\nIn multiplayer mode, we‚Äôll hold monthly in-game events relevant to DAO news, events, and popular holidays.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/h41ZJ6O.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UkWHRQ5.png)\nWe aim to differentiate our game from competitors by improving the user experience and providing creative ideas, attractive maps, and Nouns that engage players in exciting challenges. Ultimately, our focus is on delivering a flawless and engaging game experience, and continuously improving it to create a supportive and enjoyable experience for players.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aaNzoDt.png)\nAfter the full release of the game, we plan to hold various competitions, ranging from seasonal events to in-game events and those related to important events in the NounsDAO community. By offering special Nouns-related prizes, our goal is to create more challenges for players and familiarize them with DAOs and NFTs. Additionally, we can hold custom events upon the request of NounsDAO.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/r4In8Ph.png)\nWe aim to reach **25,000** downloads in the first month after the game's release, and strive to achieve a steady growth rate of **5%** in monthly downloads. We intend to encourage players to engage in the single-player mode and invite their friends to play the multiplayer mode.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JV5rG3L.png)\nWe incentivize players to invite their friends to play the game by offering rewards. Additionally, we create private clones for players to have a space to discuss the game.\n\n---\n\n## Why a Mobile Game?\nMobile games are easily available to everyone with a smartphone these days and have a wide audience range.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5n5Er5H.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## Nouns DAO community?\n\nGiven the importance of the Nouns DAO community to our game, we have decided to leverage the collaboration with its members by inviting them to contribute ideas, feedback, and even resources to the game. This action will help foster a sense of ownership and strengthen the connection between our game and the community, ultimately ensuring its success.\nIn addition to inviting Nouns DAO members to collaborate on the game, we have decided to launch a Discord channel to share the game's production stages with the Nouns community. This channel will serve as a communication space for receiving ideas, feedback, and criticism from Nouns community members, as well as a place to showcase the game's development stages and updates to them. By doing so, we can listen to user feedback more effectively and make the best decisions for the game in sync with the community.\n\n---\n\n## How Long Will It Take To Produce?\n\nThe early access version will be released after 6 months and then it will take 6 months more until the final release.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vV3NDUV.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6vUzwGF.png)\n\n---\n\nYou've seen and love our work with the nounish music videos we've created, let's make a game with even more impact!\n\n---\n\n## Marketing\n- App Store Optimization (ASO): This gives maximum exposure to our game in the store by lowering our cost per install (CPI) and filtering high-value users. It all needs to have localized content (Keywords, Categories, Screenshots, and Video Trailers) per region and culture. This is a full-time job of a user acquisition manager excluding producing visual content.\n- Landing page: This is a one-page website where customers can learn more about our game. The landing page includes links to the App Store and Google Play Store, promo videos, a call-to-action, screenshots, gameplay trailers and reviews.\n- Running paid Youtube and social media ads: Targeted ads on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. These platforms allow us to reach specific audiences based on factors such as demographics, interests, and behaviors.(The cost will be optimized by ASO)\n- Offering incentives for referrals: Encourage existing players to share the game with their friends by offering rewards or incentives for referrals.\n- Influencer marketing: Partnering with social media influencers or YouTubers who have a relevant audience can be an effective way to generate buzz and interest in the game. The budget could be used to compensate these influencers for promoting the game on their channels.\n----\n\n## Monetization\n- In-app purchases: Our game will offer a variety of ways for players to make in-app purchases to enhance their gaming experience and generate revenue for the game.\n  - In-Game Items: Players can purchase in-game items such as currency, power-ups, and other bonuses to improve their gameplay.\n  - Battle Passes: Players can purchase a Battle Pass to unlock new game modes, competitions, and exclusive rewards for a limited time. This popular monetization strategy creates a sense of urgency and excitement for players, increasing engagement and revenue for the game.\n  - (By offering these in-app purchases, we can provide players with new and exciting ways to engage with the game while generating revenue for the project.)\n- Sponsorship or Brand Partnerships: Collaborating with a brand to promote their product or service within the game. This can generate revenue without relying solely on in-app purchases.\n- Crowdfunding: As part of our monetization plan, we will be leveraging the power of NFTs to offer a unique crowdfunding option for our game. By purchasing an NFT from us, supporters will not only be helping to fund the development of our game, but they will also receive exclusive in-game items and benefits.\n\nThe NFTs purchased through our crowdfunding campaign will be useable within the game as character skins, attachments, and other in-game items. This provides a unique and exciting opportunity for our supporters to be part of the game's development and to have a tangible stake in its success.\n\nAdditionally, these NFTs can be traded on secondary markets, creating a potential revenue stream for our supporters and adding to the game's overall ecosystem. We believe that this innovative use of NFTs in crowdfunding will not only benefit our game's development, but also provide a new way for people to support and engage with the project.\n\n\n----\n\n\n## Who Are We?\nThe **[Genius Slackers](https://geniusslackers.com/)** team is an independent producer of video games.

We are confident that Nounish Playground will be a success for us.\n\n---\n\nYou've seen and love our work with the nounish music videos we've created, let's make a game with even more impact!\n\n**Click on the picture below to see the music video**üëá\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/4YJlGgp.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e-3rIzsQWw)\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/ZRCbq5i.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX3H2oI4Rrs\n)\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/Vpkp0qz.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQjWXc2EHQk)\n\n---\n\n**Production Team Areas of Expertise**\n* Programming\n* Art direction\n* Game design\n* Level design\n* Environment Art\n* Animation\n* Character design\n* UI design\n* Lighting\n* Technical art\n* Music\n* Sound Design\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SJw7C04.gif)\n\n---\n\n## Budget and Cost Breakdown\n**This budget covers 12 months of production to deliver a game with 700 levels plus a solid marketing plan.**\n\nTo make this game economically viable, we will use some existing assets created by the community by directing all technical designs to be compatible with the **[Nouns 3D](https://)** project and implementing audio made with the **[Noun Sounds](https://)** PLAYground, ultimately saving a lot on costs for a game like this.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CrjIyiQ.png)\n\n---\n## Budget\n* Programming Team: $42,000 \n* Art production: $54,000 \n* Game design & Level design: $54,000 \n* Sound & composition: $10,000 \n* Marketing: $40,000\n* **Total Budget: $200,000**\n\n**The budget required for the early access release is $90,000.**\nOnce the early access is released after **6** months, we will require the remaining budget to complete the development of the game.\n\n---\n\n## Why Should You Vote For This Game?\n\nIn the proposal, we outline a unique approach to game development that incorporates cutting-edge technologies such as NFTs and influencer marketing to generate buzz and revenue. By leveraging these strategies, our game will not only provide players with a fun and engaging experience, but it will also introduce them to the exciting world of Nouns DAO and cryptocurrency.\n\nThrough our ASO, paid ads, and referral incentives, we aim to reach a wide audience and drive downloads. Our monetization plan includes in-app purchases, battle passes, brand partnerships, and innovative NFT-based crowdfunding that will allow supporters to contribute to the game's development while receiving exclusive in-game items and benefits.\n\nWith all of the game's content being open-source and available to the public, we are committed to continually updating and expanding the game over time. By voting for our proposal, you are supporting a game that is not only entertaining and engaging but also pushing the boundaries of gaming and crypto.\n\n---\n\n## Game Engine\nWith **Unreal Engine 5**, we have access to a variety of powerful web3 plugins that enable us to seamlessly integrate blockchain and NFT features into our upcoming mobile platformer game. We're excited to leverage the engine's capabilities to create an immersive and innovative gaming experience for our players.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mub7e3k.png)\n\n---\n\n## Measuring Success\nWe will be able to measure success in a number of ways including, but not limited to:\n- analytics on game installs/downloads\n- daily active users\n- call to action clicks\n- landing page metrics\n- social media engagement and analytics\n\n---\n\n### Thank you for your consideration! We hope to get the chance to build the best and most nounish game to exist",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 275 - Treasury Diversification: Swap 400 wstETH -> rETH via TWAMM",
      "content": "# Treasury Diversification: Swap 400 wstETH -> rETH via TWAMM\n\n## tldr;\nHelp execute treasury diversification of the [Nouns DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10), specifically `wstETH => rETH`. We have built a tool that‚Äôs tailor-made to help execute these trades:¬†*TWAMM.* The trade will be executed completely on-chain, transparently with very low fees and minimal gas costs.\n\n## **Background**\nTWAMM is a concept introduced by¬†[Paradigm](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/07/twamm)¬†in July 2021. *\"It works by breaking long-term orders into infinitely many infinitely small pieces and executing them against an embedded constant-product AMM smoothly over time.\"*\n\nAn on-chain AMM protocol to enable large token swap is essential to increase DeFi adoption and anti-fragility. Some interesting use cases for TWAMMs include¬†[treasury diversification](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1502177286170185735)*,*¬†[whale liquidations](https://twitter.com/solendprotocol/status/1538553654575214592)*,*¬†[peg maintenance](https://www.notion.so/fd88cb37208d4b0f9abaca4e276f9ddd)*, etc*.\n\n## **Product Design & Incentives**\nWe have been researching and developing TWAMMs since November 2021 and recently launched our protocol: [announcement](https://twitter.com/cronfinance/status/1645802789006876672). The code has been audited by SpearbitDAO, open-sourced, and verified on Etherscan. There‚Äôs more detail on the protocol on our [docs page](https://docs.cronfi.com/twamm/).\n- AMM: we built our TWAMM as a custom pool on top of Balancer V2 Vaults given the¬†*security, liquidity, flexibility, and gas advantages*¬†of leveraging Balancer. Additionally, Balancer has become a Schelling point for protocols that want to leverage their AMM, thus creating network effects & composability advantages.\n- Traders: as a long-term trader (Nouns DAO), you only have to pay gas for starting, canceling, or withdrawing proceeds from your order. All the other sub-orders of the DCA are done virtually and cost the Nouns DAO no gas fees. Virtual orders are only written on-chain when the next user interacts with the protocol (generally an arbitrageur).\n- Arbitrageurs: as seen on other AMMs like Uniswap, arbitrageurs are important to keep the price of the assets in line with external venues. Arbitrageurs are critical for TWAMMs because trade sizes are significantly larger and last for multiple blocks. Therefore we partnered with dedicated arbitrageurs (BloXRoute) to ensure pools are frequently arbitraged thus giving you a smooth fill.\n- Liquidity: Balancer already has over ***$131M*** in wstETH and ***$62M*** in rETH in the vault. We have successfully received a [liquidity + gauge](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/bip-265-enable-wsteth-reth-gauge-ethereum/4643) to direct some of the liquidity to our TWAMM pool to provide the resting liquidity needed to execute this trade. TWAMMs are extremely capital efficient given that the trades are split across multiple blocks and arbitrageurs consistently bring new liquidity back to the system to correct price deviations.\n\n## **Advantages**\n- Low fees: wstETH/rETH is a stable pair and long-term swappers pay a one-time¬†**0.03% fee.**\n- Fully on-chain: zero dependencies on off-chain services, oracles, compute etc.\n- Flexible: issue, change, and cancel orders with ease.\n    - Example new order:¬†`sell 14_000 wstETH for rETH in 100_000 blocks` ~roughly 2 weeks\n    - Easy to use Gnosis Safe custom transaction UX\n- Full control of orders and assets: non-custodial, cancellable, and withdraw proceeds at any time.\n- Withdraw multiple times: users can withdraw once at the end, or every set number of blocks ‚Äì they just pay gas fees.\n- DCA over 1000‚Äôs of blocks gas-free: Nouns DAO would only pay gas for starting and ending orders, and arbitrageurs pay for placing suborders on-chain.\n- Analytics: we will have an analytics dashboard that shows how the order is being filled so the DAO can monitor the trade.\n\n## **Risks & Mitigations**\nThe first trade will be for a relatively *small* amount of roughly 400 wstETH -> rETH to ensure TWAMM executes the trade as expected. Below are a few potential risks of the system and how we have and plan to mitigate them:\n- Smart contract:\n    - Fully audited: see SpearbitDAO report [here](https://github.com/spearbit/portfolio/blob/master/pdfs/CronFinance-Spearbit-Security-Review.pdf).\n    - Hack Risks: built on Balancer V2 Vaults which have been battle-tested for 2+ years.\n    - Bricked Pools: we‚Äôve done extensive research and mitigations for gas, order DDoS, numerical underflows, incorrect TWAMM parameters etc ‚Äì more info here:¬†[0slippage](https://mirror.xyz/0slippage.eth).\n    - Loss of Funds: open-source code, audited, verified, non-custodial, users in full control of funds, trade happens over multiple blocks so it can be canceled at any time by the user.\n    - Malicious Pool Admin: all pool administrators can do is pause the pool or change fees at which point Nouns DAO can cancel and withdraw their funds.\n- Lack of Arbitrage: we have teamed up with BloXroute to provide dedicated arbitrage service. On the off chance neither service arbitrages the pool, the open market will arbitrage the pool.\n- Poor Execution: orders are cancellable at any time i.e if the price escapes preferred bounds restart the order at another time. Also, DCA is generally a better strategy than spot purchase for large orders.\n  - Monitoring: we will be actively monitoring the trade as the `delegate` to ensure the order is being filled at an optimal price. In case the trade escapes the optimal threshold, we will cancel the trade on behalf of the DAO and proceeds will be refunded to the Nouns DAO wallet.\n- Information Leakage: this is not a big concern for a stable pair like wstETH/rETH which are like assets and have deep liquidity pools.\n- MEV/Sandwich Attacks: orders are broken into small pieces and thus the benefit of front/back running orders is minimal ‚Äì see the Paradigm paper for further details.\n\n## **Competition**\n\nHere are the alternatives and how they stack up against TWAMM. Note this isn‚Äôt a comprehensive list, but a short summary.\n\n- Gnosis Auction:\n    - Pros: well-tested technology\n    - Cons: reliant on well-funded keepers, minimum buy lots, price upside capped, infrastructure overhead, limited timeframe, poor execution vs DCA over long periods.\n- Manual DCA:\n    - Pros: can execute it today\n    - Cons: need to write a smart contract or fat finger mistakes, fees for each sub-order, gas costs of sub-orders, limited # of sub-orders\n- DEX/Aggregators:\n    - Pros: complete trade in a single block\n    - Cons: slippage, MEV attack vectors\n- OTC:\n    - Pros: limit orders and other novel trade execution algorithms\n    - Cons: off-chain, opaque, high fees, custodial, KYC, regulations, etc",

      "content": "# Oni Residency: Nouns Community Discord & Onboarding\n\n## Nouns Community Discord & Onboarding\n\nProposal for 6 months of funding to commit time to transform the Jungle & more.\n\nWith the closure of official Nouns DAO Discord, I created the Jungle to be a neutral, spiritual successor to the old discord as a place for Nouners to connect with one another, discuss proposals, and engage with the larger Nouns community. Unfortunately the time of this transition was a low point for the community; there was confusion/sadness/drama surrounding the discord closure, Nouns auction prices were down, the overall market was down, and vibes were down in general. Some of this carried over into the Jungle at it‚Äôs inception, leading to some negative first impressions and lasting impacting on discord‚Äôs culture/perception at a time when it was most important.\n\nI am planning to rebrand the Jungle into a general Nouns DAO Community discord and engaging other community leaders in hopes of capturing the same spirit and camaraderie we had with the initial Nouns DAO discord.\n\nI am requesting funding to ensure the necessary time and effort goes into maximizing the value that this discord can provide to the Nouns community, in addition other nounish contributions I want to focus on over the coming months.\n\n[![Nouns Community Discord](https://i.imgur.com/4S1HO1t.png)](https://discord.gg/T5K7U6DM)\n\n## Currently\nThe Jungle hosts weekly calls for Nouners & Delegates to discuss on-chain proposals, neutrally leading the group through pending proposals while allowing the public to listen in and hear how voters are weigh in on pending props. These calls initially followed the format of discord‚Äôs weekly private calls, however the calls have recently shifted to be public  with a Q&A component where Proposers are encouraged to join the call & answer questions and provide extra context/clarity to their props.\n\nIn addition, chat channels are maintained for each on-chain proposal to allow for async conversations between Nouners/Delegates, Builders, and the larger Nouns community\n\n\n[![Nouns Community Discord](https://i.imgur.com/F1O7wkC.png)](https://discord.gg/T5K7U6DM)\n\n\n## Opportunities\nI want to transform the Jungle into the premiere place for onboarding new Nouners, not only to the Nouns Community Discord itself but by providing credibly neutral, up-to-date information around on-chain proposals and the highest impact communities, initiatives, and activations happening across the Nouns ecosystem. \n*\tImplement automated processes for new members joining the Discord, providing up-to-date links and resources\n*\tCreate onboarding documentation for new DAO members, working with the community to compile and maintain high-value resources/links/information all in one place\n*\tLeverage Discord‚Äôs Forum feature to create posts for every past on-chain proposal to provide a one stop shop for async discussion for anything that is, or has ever been on-chain.\n\n[![Nouns Community Discord](https://i.imgur.com/nZmjLlL.png)](https://discord.gg/T5K7U6DM)\n\n## Roles & Responsibilities\n\n* Credibly Neutral Head Admin for the Nouns Community Discord server\n* Manage admins & community liasons\n* Reach out to new DAO members/auction winners to connect 1-on-1, providing context on current happenings around the community and answering any questions they may have, help with potential prop ideas, etc\n     - I will seek out new DAO members outside of the Discord, providing links to a variety of Nouns Communities Groups in addition to highlighting resources like [Nouns Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/voters) for delegation opportunities if they aren't interested in governance\n* Chat Moderation\n* Facilitate Public Weekly Nouner Calls with help from other community leads as needed\n* Design and make available sample proposal templates\n* Calendly link with at least 2 hours per week of 15-30 minute slots available to anyone in the Discord for proposal feedback, or questions/discussions around anything else Nouns related\n* Engage with other nounish communities that have reached critical mass to get self-appointed community liasons \n* Additional ongoing efforts within the DAO\n    - Note: I will **not** take any additional compensation from the following initiatives/proposals for the duration of this residency\n    - Nouns Esports Pod\n        - Pod Strategy, Oversight, Creative, Prop reviewing & feedback\n        - Drive Partnership / Revenue Opportunities for Nouns Esports\n    - Nouns x The Skatepark Project Partnership [(Prop 40)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/40)\n        - Continue to foster relationship with TSP\n        - Put forward at least 2 proposals\n\n[![Nouns x TSP](https://i.imgur.com/rl384Qe.png)](https://twitter.com/apenoun/status/1539372324046110721)\n\n## Crowdsourcing Community Leadership\nI want all nounish communities that reach critical mass to have representation and a voice in the Nouns Community Discord and will be reaching out to sub-daos/groups active in the space encouraging them to provide 2 self-appointed communitity liasons.

WarpedWorld is a collaboration of the original Warped partners/founders and Creative Artists Agency (CAA).**\n\n**Together, NounsDAO and WarpedWorld will create a newly empowered world and community where entire industries like music and entertainment are reimagined through the use of NFT technology.**\n\n\n**This proposal launches a partnership growth strategy during which @jdagogo will focus exclusively on executing initiatives within the Nouns ecosystem.**\n\n# **A Radical Re-Invention ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®**\n\nThe initial focus of this proposal is WarpedWorld, the web3 reimagining of the Warped Tour festival and community. The festival was founded over 25 years ago by J.D. and his collaborators.\n\nAdditionally, this proposal aims to refine the playbook for onboarding established communities into the Nouns ecosystem and web3, empowered through a Nounish development hub, and including the introduction of **WarpedDAO.** \n\nIntroducing Nouns to millions of people and empowering communities to join Nouns will achieve a high ROI on this initiative.\n\n\nThroughout this prop, UnitedTribes led by [@jdagogo](https://twitter.com/jdagogo) [(J.D. Heilprin)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdheilprin) will use the same approach he's used as an entrepreneur and Entrepreneur/Evangelist in Residence to generate a variety of projects, outlined below. The main focus is onboarding new communities and creating collabrative partnership opportunities for NounsDAO via WarpedWorld. \n\nWarpedWorld will kick-off with a series of IRL activations involving and proliferating the NounsDAO community. The initial term will lay the foundation for a long-term Nounish collaboration. \n\n**In the first 6 months, J.D. will bring his WarpedWorld project and partners to the Nouns ecosystem, and a series of proposals will be introduced to the NounsDAO.**\n\n\n# **Proposal Video ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®**\n\nWATCH FULL PROPOSAL VIDEO [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zqf3GZ2wmXw).\n\n# **Proposal Objectives ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®**\n\nThe primary objective is to create distinctly Nounish projects and proposals by leveraging J.D.'s network and experience activating new communities. Success will be achieved by expanding the reach of Nouns to new communities and working with the Nouns community of builders, resources, and tools to implement these proposals.\n \n\nThe success of this initiative will be measured by qualitative and quantitative metrics. To this end, J.D. and UnitedTribes will launch a blog for updates throughout the entire proposal period. J.D. will also host a live Twitter space once per month for live Q&A‚Äôs and progress updates for all things *Nouns Get Warped!*\n\n# **Proposer Background ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®**\n\nJ.D. is a multi-venture entrepreneur and builder who began his career at Creative Artists Agency (CAA).

J.D. and UnitedTribes will introduce Nouns to new communities and facilitate new communities joining Nouns, activating vibrant Noun sub-DAOs. J.D. will introduce Nouns and facilitate proposals across his network of media organizations, artists, and creators. \n\nUnitedTribes aims to become a fully equipped development studio and hub that creates breakthrough Nounish applications, ecosystem extensions, and synergies, starting with several core projects.

Warped has a long history of successful brand partnerships.\n\nJ.D. & UnitedTribes will bring the WarpedWorld project to the Nouns ecosystem. As one of the most ambitious web3 projects for an established brand, WarpedWorld promises to break new ground. Plans include **WarpedDAO** as an engine for ecosystem growth. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Czmx5pR.png)\n\n\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/hOHobUp.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucBZShxZGb0)\n*Warped Causes and Philanthropy: A Big part of Warped & A Big Part of \"Nouns Get Warped\"*\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/sOnCeud.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqp8Ox8kCb4)\n*Education has always been core to Warped Tour and will play a critical role in WarpedWorld Phase 1, teaching web3 and onboarding to the NounsDAO & WarpedWorld ecosystem.*\n \n\n---\n\n\n\n# Nouns Industry Evangelist & Ambassador ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\n**J.D. & UnitedTribes‚Äô other web3 Projects + Nouns**\n\nJ.D. will introduce his other existing projects to the Nouns ecosystem as proposals, utilizing the Noun infrastructure to proliferate the Nouns meme and community while activating new audiences.  \n\nExample projects include collaborating with an acclaimed dance cinematographer and a top dance company to support pro and amateur dancers worldwide, as well as a concept celebrating music scholarship with top-tier artists. Both projects focus on generating Nounish benefits while fostering community.\n\n**Digging Deep into J.D.‚Äôs Network & EIR experience**\n\nAs both an entrepreneur and EIR, J.D. will draw on his experience to bring additional projects and communities to the Nouns ecosystem. For example, inspired by the recent ‚ÄúWizard‚Äôs Hat‚Äù short film and Wizard Nouns, J.D. has already introduced the concept of a potential Nouns collaboration with the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Warner Bros., and the Potter fan community. At Warner Bros., J.D. worked extensively with Wizarding World.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yBceGEt.png)\n\nAdditional opportunities will involve working with existing IP holders, creative, tech, and performative talent, and the institutions across J.D.‚Äôs network. \n\nJ.D. will serve as a Nouns educator, evangelist, and facilitator in both his network and the traditional media, entertainment, and marketing industries. He will introduce talent, venture capitalists, builders, developers, creatives, and prospective strategic partners to the Nouns ecosystem and opportunities for Nounish endeavors. J.D. will collaborate with NounsOTG and other initiatives to make introductions and leverage resources. Over the last two months, J.D. has tested the waters to a tremendous response. \n\n**Lending a Strategic Hand Across the Nouniverse**\n\nJ.D. will partner with established Nouns projects to generate synergies among UnitedTribes initiatives and assist Noun projects needing access to talent and organizations throughout his network. \n\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EJIOpwo.png)\n\nThis Proposal requests $129,000 USDC be sent over three transactions to a 7 person multi-sig for the initial 6-month development period, representing the fee for @jdagogo's work and development expenses. \n\n\n# Funding Breakdown ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\nThe funding breakdown for the 6-month development period is as follows:\n* **$99,000 USDC ($16,500 USDC per month x 6 mo)** for @jdagogo's fee to work exclusively as Nouns developer/creator/builder collaboration generating new projects and outreach activities, and to establish UnitedTribes as a project hub. \n* **$30,000 USDC ($5,000 USDC per month x 6 mo)** for expenses related to community outreach and attending events; for engaging Noun community members to provide services related to prototypes, design, proposals, and projects associated with @unitedtribes.io and @jdagogo generating new Nouns proposals and proliferation; for purchasing Noggles and other Nouns swag as appropriate, etc.  \n\n# Proposal Phases ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\n\n**CCO NounsDAO brand and technology assets will be utilized acrosss all phases.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 271 - ‚ÄúThe Nominal Hero‚Äù: A Nouns Middle Grade Novel",
      "content": "# ‚ÄúThe Nominal Hero‚Äù: A Nouns Middle Grade Novel\n\nTL;DR: I‚Äôm writing a middle-grade novel called ‚ÄúThe Nominal Hero.‚Äù\n\nCaden Keller, age eight, is an imaginative boy who loves words and reading. One day, he gets hold of a pair of glasses that let him call up Nouns, who are more than happy to use their Nounish powers to bring chaos and adventure into his life. But when a few careless words summon a threat to the Nouniverse, can Caden use the power of language to save the world?\n\nABOUT THE BOOK: The general vibe is Beverly Cleary‚Äôs ‚ÄúRamona‚Äù series meets Norton Juster‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Phantom Tollbooth.‚Äù I‚Äôm aiming it at six-to-ten-year-olds, and it‚Äôll be fairly light-hearted: no tragedies, no dead pets, just adventures as the strange and surreal world of the Nouniverse intersects with the everyday home and school life of Caden and his friends and family.\n\nI want this to be a book that kids will enjoy reading on their own and that adults will also have fun reading to them. I‚Äôm running it by my favourite eight-year-old as I go, to make sure that the vocabulary level is appropriate and that the whole thing is fun and entertaining to a bright kid.\n\nI‚Äôm linking the first two chapters here, as text and as an audio file of me reading them aloud. I‚Äôve got five chapters written so far, out of a planned twelve, and I have a clear outline of how the story will proceed. I expect to release an additional chapter about every three weeks, which I‚Äôll be posting at http://rookswater.blogspot.com. When the whole thing is out, I‚Äôll do some final edits and put together the definitive edition in ebook form. At that time, I‚Äôll post a separate proposal for launching the ebook as a timed open edition mint event.\n\nAudio:\nhttps://youtu.be/_-usP1Qe78c\n\nChapter 1:\nhttps://rookswater.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-nominal-hero-ch-1.html\n\nChapter 2:\nhttps://rookswater.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-nominal-hero-ch-2.html\n\nTHE ASK: I‚Äôm requesting 25 ETH. This is for two things. First, to cover my living expenses for the next six months to let me focus on finishing the book. Second, I will be placing the book in the public domain immediately; this means that, unlike with a traditionally published book, I won‚Äôt be able to sell things like foreign-language rights, reprint rights, film option rights, and so forth. So this is partly to compensate for the lack of those future revenue streams, which normally provide traditionally published authors with a significant part of our ongoing income.\n\nI‚Äôd like to stream this amount over the course of six months. I‚Äôve put up the first two chapters here, I‚Äôll post the third right away on acceptance of this proposal, and then I‚Äôll be posting a new chapter every three weeks, so in just about six months the whole book will be available. I‚Äôll provide the final edited book in .epub and .pdf formats no more than one month after the last chapter is posted.\n\nABOUT TASHA K. ROOKSWATER: Under another name, I‚Äôm an author of science fiction and fantasy, primarily short stories and novellas. I‚Äôm enjoying the freedom of writing something completely different under this pseudonym. \n\nI‚Äôm a newcomer to crypto, but I‚Äôm fascinated by the artistic potential of this space. I love the public-domain aspect of Nouns and I‚Äôm looking forward to other people building on Caden‚Äôs story. I‚Äôm a big believer in fanfiction and the collaborative nature of storytelling, and I‚Äôm excited to send this book out into the world and see what comes back.\n\nProposer notes:\n \nTasha is a published science fiction author and IRL associate that I introduced to Nouns. I encouraged her to write this proposal because I think she's talented and that our ecosystem will benefit from the participation of more storytellers. Please feel free to follow up with any questions on Twitter: @rookswater and @punk4156. Thank you!",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 270 - Archives.wtf - Extension",
      "content": "# Archives.wtf - Extension\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HRZT5II.jpg)\n\n## **1. TL;DR**\n\nWe would like to seek funding of 192.4K USDC *(~99 ETH)* to keep maintaining & developing [archives.wtf](https://archives.wtf/) as the main archive center of Nouns DAO over the next 6 months (May '23-Oct '23). Our focus is to increase the current media contents of Nouns ecosystem with the support of software improvements & public goods tools together enhancing user experiences.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Proposal Summary**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FKYUjfp.jpg)\n\n### **Prop 176 Recap**\n\nOn December 3rd, we were [funded](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdd7e4d8a5fef6702f7e9c5b45db440ba7a6e00c0#internaltx) of 32.28 ETH ($42K) to build an archive center which stores & display all media contents of Nouns DAO's projects & artworks and all the memes proliferations.\n\n**In the past 4 months we have ;**\n\n1. [Archives.wtf](https://archives.wtf/) - built a reliable archive website from the ground up\n2. Built features ; [link to thread](https://twitter.com/thevoadz/status/1641034993798467593?s=20)\n* under any categories, you can search any related data within the page, eg ; **Nouns On-chain Proposal**\n    * prop number\n    * project title\n    * description\n    * builders/artists\n    * category\n* we enable **scroll, filter & search persistence** for better user navigation ( which stored on your device )\n* you can use **cmd+k / ctrl+k** for quick access to search in page\n* cc0 icon & download button\n3. As per 4/11/2023, we have gathered and archived ;\n* [Proposals](https://archives.wtf/props) ([On-chain](https://archives.wtf/props/onchain), [Prop House](https://archives.wtf/props/prop-house) & [NSFW](https://archives.wtf/props/nsfw-small-grants)) ; **611 proposals, 410 builders**\n* Contests by [Noun Square](https://archives.wtf/special), [4156](https://archives.wtf/nouns), [Gnars DAO](https://archives.wtf/subdao/gnars-dao), [Noadz](https://archives.wtf/noggles/noggles-art-contest) ; **606 artworks & entries, 326 artists**\n    * Nouniversary\n    * Nouns Holiday\n    * Nouns Mash-up\n    * Nouns Movies\n    * Nouns Sneakers\n    * Nouns Esports\n    * Nouns Space\n    * 100 Days of Nouns\n\n4. Total No of Builders - [Link](https://voadz.notion.site/ca874dfc6bff42eb9ae48e1af51d9258?v=3ef4593de67d487b9f50c625c7e46de2)\n5. Built a tool named [Uploadr](https://uploadr.app/) for quick data upload & storage to the Arweave network\n6. Organized & compiled full database in [Nouns Archive's Notion](https://voadz.notion.site/Nouns-Archive-da52f93301dd4ed59e5b876bd5151d93)\n\n**Feedbacks from the communities**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Rzlefqe.png)\n**Past reference**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7JC7JYU.png)\n\n---\n\n## **3. Project Goals For Upcoming 6 Months**\n\n### **The Key Challenges**\nFrom [Prop 176](https://nouns.wtf/vote/176) :\n\n* There isn't currently a main archive center that stores and display all datas like \n    * proposal progress images/videos\n    * end product images/videos/links/repo\n    * nounish artworks from contests, events\n    * cc0 contents & working files\n* It is difficult for new people to discover any nounish contents because it is dispersed everywhere, throughout Twitter, Instagram & other platforms unless they have their own website or media-oriented approach which uses apps like Youtube. Particularly from the perspective of those who do not fully comprehend the Nouns ecosystem and where they might find it.\n* There is no specific rule for proposers to update their project progress everyday, fortnightly, or once a month but we could encourage people to do that more often if we help to provide the right tools.\n* Some builders with huge outcomes but stucked with time constraint need an additional support to archive their outputs.\n\nAs a central resource platform, cross pollination is one of things needed. Some of the early builders require assistance with visibility. With the connected links that point people to each nounish projects and builders, we assist the public in finding them.\n\n### **The Strategies**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EKvVcFO.png)\n\n**Strategy 1 ; Curated submission form**\n\n* We want to build **a curated submission form** attached to the website which benefits from multiple touchpoints.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) and could request to submit a new sub-category and additional contents to their existing proposals/details.\n* The forms will allow users to select their preferred category, status, type of house, round, etc. *(based on specific usage)*\n* User can check their submission history together with submission details *(eg; date, title & status)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zRGCmYR.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kYzeI8v.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AUrMjNR.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1rQXaEQ.png)\n\n---\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gVzs6Ih.png)\n\n**Strategy 2 ; Uploader**\n\n* We want to improvise an [uploader](https://uploadr.app/) with some new features which we have built for the past few months.\n* Users are required for wallet connect (NNS supported) & it will be token gated focusing on Nouns ecosystem to use it for free ;\n    * Nounders\n    * Nouners\n    * Nounish Builders\n    * Sub DAOs\n    * Nouns' NFT Open Edition Holders / Droposals *(This Is Nouns, The Wizard's Hat etc)*\n* Anyone who has just got noun-pilled into the ecosystem and want to use it, they may choose from any of the available criteria above. This will gradually benefit the Nouns DAO ecosystem over time.\n* User can check their upload history together with the details *(eg; date, title & arweave link)*\n* The fee of the uploaded permanent data is included under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IoUQQkb.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KFIzROZ.png)\n\n---\n\n**Strategy 3 ; Tooling R&D**\n\n* We want to create and launch tooling research and development that will bring significant effect on the process and project's efficiency and for the DAO where everyone could benefit from it.\n* We will use the fund under **OpEx** in ***Budget***.\n\n**The strategies mentioned are what we are focused on so far, but they are subject to change along the way or the best recommendations from the community. There will be more along the journey.*\n\n### **Data Permanence**\n\n* We are using **Arweave** network to store all the datas due to its one time fee permanent storage and we want to use it exclusively for all storage going forward.\n* Currently, around **40%** of the datas are now saved on Arweave, with the remaining **60%** being processed. *(Currently on Notion)*\n* There have been a few instances where artists or builders have discontinued their hosting and lost their tracks; this is something we do not want to happen again.\n* We want to make sure all datas of Nouns ecosystem are permanently stored in a decentralised manner and is always accessible.\n* We are able to boost the website's performance with the help of **Vercel Edge Network** which offers image optimization, page load speed & automatically data cached on the network.\n* The cost of uploading will be factor in under **OpEx** as per attached in ***Budget***.\n* Publish monthly data report of [archives.wtf ](https://archives.wtf/) for public reference.\n* All compiled datas are stored in [Nouns Archive's notion](https://voadz.notion.site/Nouns-Archive-da52f93301dd4ed59e5b876bd5151d93).\n\n### **RSS Feed**\n\nUtilising a simplified and condensed data feed can be more efficient than navigating through an entire website for the required information, making data feed crucial for individual use cases. That is why we're adding feed as a new feature, to make it easier for you to access the data you need and achieve your goals more efficiently.\n\nWe will provide a few types of feed for the main & sub-category pages ;\n  * RSS feed - /rss.xml\n  * Atom  feed - /atom.xml\n  * JSON feed - /feed.json\n\nThe data we have gathered can be utilised by everyone in the ecosystem for their own unique purposes. For instance, a mini companion app can directly use the JSON feed to list all proposals in NSFW Small Grants.\n\n### **Analytics**\n\nWe believe data transparency is important for the DAO & community. We are using **Vercel's Web Analytics** to get detailed insights. It provides in-depth information about your website's visitors, new metrics like top pages, top referrers, and demographics including information on countries, operating systems, and browsers.\n\nAs of *29th March - 20th April 2023,*\n\n* Visitors & Page Views\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8LkuQZn.png)\n\n* Panels\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zPo4dKf.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EUNHjX6.png)\n\n### **Sustainability Strategy**\n\nThe main intention of this project is to provide long-term benefits for Nouns. It serves as main archive center that provides wide media contents all over Nouns ecosystem for public reference. Once the open-source repository is public, we will be able to observe other NFT communities with active builders & projects and who benefits from Nouns' product to use it such as ;\n\n**Possible Candidates**\n* Nouns' extension & derivatives\n* Meebits\n* On-Chain Monkey\n* UMA\n* TinyDinos\n* Anata\n\n### **What's next?**\n\nWe certainly have long-term goals with few phases as we wish to accomplish them gradually. We attempt to avoid by highlighting all of our future objectives in one specific proposal as it sounds overly ambitious as we aim to underpromise and over-deliver. We believe that this will provide long term values and benefits to the DAO. It may not be a direct ROI.\n\nSome ideas worth looking at ;\n1. Preservation of archive material ( physical & digital )\n2. Nouns Archive '23 ( Limited physical edition )\n3. Publications - zines/quarterly\n4. Archive Data Request\n5. Ticketed exhibition of Nouns Archive materials ( ROI to DAO )\n\n---\n\n## **4. Deliverables**\n\nTo be delivered over the next 6 months ;\n* Maintaining & developing [archives.wtf](https://archives.wtf/) with all existing & incoming database of medias & arts in Nouns' ecosystem for the next 6 months.\n* Curated submission form & uploader. *(under Strategy)*\n* Toolings R&D. *(under Strategy)*\n* Nouns Archive repository.\n* RSS Feed\n* Daily nounish post in randomly manner on our social media, [Nouns Archive](https://twitter.com/NounsArchive).\n\n**Short-term checklist** *( to be archived )*\n\n* [Nouns Museum](https://twitter.com/thenounsmuseum)\n* [InternatioNouns](https://twitter.com/InternatioNouns)\n* Nouns AI's Contest\n* Messhup's Cover Art\n\n**Long-term checklist** *( to be archived )*\n\n* Prop House (Other houses, eg ; [Lil Nouns](https://prop.house/lil-nouns), [Nouns Japan](https://prop.house/nouns-japan), [Nouns Builder](https://prop.house/builder) etc)\n* Nouns On-Chain Props\n* NSFW\n* The Noun Square\n* Nouns World\n* Nouns' POAP Art\n\n---\n\n## **5.

      "content": "# Gnarly EP\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pW1Lxnj.png)\n\n**Gnarly EP** is a three track release by [Lil Bubble](https://twitter.com/thecryptobubble), an extremely nounish recording artist and Gnars DAO member. These original songs were commissioned [by Gnars for 3 ETH](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0xbb73acb16a3b968a7cde352cf046b7d015b0dde0bce3a6d16355d28cf9d519e8) and this droposal marks our official [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) release of the music and cover art. \n\n---\n\n## ‚ö°Ô∏è TLDR\n\n- Gnarly EP is a 3 track CC0 release\n- Extremely nounish originals by Lil Bubble\n- Attached txs deploy Zora timed open editions\n- Droposal only with no funding requested\n- Nouns get 10% of mint proceeds\n\n---\n\n## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Introduction\n\nLil Bubble is an established Web3-native character who has been releasing satirical songs and music videos for the community since 2019. His songs and remixes put a tongue-in-cheek spin on market events and have clocked **OVER 10 MILLION VIEWS**, adding to the cultural fabric of the space with a comedic blend of music, video and niche subject matter.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/5EwyJEF.jpg)](https://twitter.com/TheCryptoBubble/status/1587404329262030849)\n\nHis engaged crypto-centric audience and alignment with Nounish values (using creative remixes and finely-crafted memes to contribute to Web3 culture) make Lil Bubble a great asset to Nouns. He has been a strong supporter and participant in the Nouns community - has featured Nouns in a previous music video, was one of the earliest members and supporters of Gnars DAO, has been a special guest in a number of Noun Square Twitter spaces, and is currently working on his own Nouns fork.\n\n## ‚≠êÔ∏è Previous Nounish Work\n\nLil Bubble featured Noun 189 and owner [Gami](https://gami.wtf) in a music video in August last year. A custom Noun skateboard was featured in the video which was shared widely throughout the community garnering over 370k impressions and 145k video views on Twitter alone.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5ZkITFM.jpg)\n\nLil Bubble grew up skateboarding and his continued support of Gnars DAO has helped us broaden our collector base. The three tracks produced for this EP have made a huge impact on our community, with \"Never Gonna Grow Up\" having already found its place as our anthem. \n\n## üöÄ Launch Plan\n\nEach of the three tracks are being released as timed open editions. You can [listen to them now](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/sets/gnarly-ep-1/s-hEnIvXqxQ1A) on SoundCloud by clicking the embedded players below.

Links provided will be updated after execution of this droposal, once able to retrieve contract addresses and URLs. Admin set to gami.eth in case any post deployment fixes required. Owner will be set to gnars.eth following drop.*\n\n## üìù Artist Remarks\n\nAs one of the first members of Gnars DAO it was fun to finally make some music for my favourite crew! There were a few elements to incorporate into the EP - Gnarly skate references, up-beat Nounish vibes, 8bit sound design, and Lil Bubble's signature crypto moonboy motif. I wanted each song to be a different style to keep things interesting. \n\n### Never Gonna Grow Up\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/iz4QGdx.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/never-gonna-grow-up/s-tNxMPjzxvJN)\n\nThis is my interpretation of Gnars (and by extension Nouns). Skateboarding played a big role in my childhood so being able to re-ignite that passion with Gnars sparks all kinds of youthful nostalgia. Connecting with a new group of people in adulthood and engaging, building and creating together in new ways gives me that same feeling. I'm never gonna grow up!\n\n### Blast Off \n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/6sM9fSe.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/blast-off/s-gIVZEDQB0wY)\n\nThis is probably my favourite instrumental on the EP. The trap beat and super simple 8bit-inspired synths are very 'Lil Bubble' and a pretty good glimpse at the direction I'm taking things with my original music moving forward. Lots of Gnars references in the lyrics!\n\n### Level Up\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/biGY1Ck.jpg)](https://soundcloud.com/lilbubble/level-up/s-rnUMscL3a6K)\n\nI wanted to step the energy up in the final track, moving in a slightly more tribal direction (Gnars is about extreme sports after all). More skate references in the lyrics - spot the shoutout to celebrity Gnars DAO member Bob Burnquist! I tied things together with plenty of digital glitches and some classic Lil Bubble trader stories. Regardless of which Web3 camp you sit in, you would have no doubt grown familiar with the market cycles and how they affect us all in one way or another. Trading aside, we should always be trying to level up and improve some area of our lives. Like my kickflips...\n\n## üéÅ Bonus Extras\n\n**Bonus 1:** Collectors who mint all three singles to complete the set will unlock a free to claim Collector's Edition EP.

It can be configured with settings that define how it can bid: MinBid, MaxBid, Tip, BidWindow, and the recipient of Nouns won.¬†¬†Once configured, anyone can submit a transaction to force the contract to bid. Calling `bid()` refunds gas and rewards the caller with a small tip, ensuring the AutoBidder consistently runs.\n\nThis Nouns AutoBidder will be deployed with the following settings: \n\n- MinBid: `30 ETH` \n- MaxBid: `30 ETH`\n- BidWindow: `24 hours`\n- Tip: `0.001 ETH` (tip is an incentive for anyone to kick off a bid)\n- Receiver: `0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10` (treasury)\n- Contract Balance: `31 ETH`\n\nThese settings will allow the AutoBidder to place a bid of 30 ETH whenever a new\nauction starts until funds are exhausted or the contract is paused.\n\nMore info can be found on how the AutoBidder works here: [Github Repository](https://github.com/nounish/autobidder)\n\n## Currently used by\n\n[Lil Nouns prop #115](https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/115) deployed v0.1 of AutoBidder for Lil Nouns to extend their\nacquisition of Nouns. \n\nWizards followed suit, deploying v0.2 of AutoBidder (which extends v0.1 with support for setting ENS reverse records).\n\n**Links to AutoBidders**\nWizards: [Etherscan Link](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb16f24e94ffe751e283a30905a9B2606605c3A46)\nLil Nouns: [Etherscan Link](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3F09354832C67a27510601530C9E9F6Ea39E2544)\nAutoBidder Factory: [Etherscan Link](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a2DA0F09d65a0034F4398BdA40df4F8A79a3293)\n\nFederation was funded in [prop #229](https://nouns.wtf/vote/229)\n\n[wiz](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_)",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 267 - Explorer Grants",
      "content": "# Explorer Grants\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**\nExplorer Grants is coming off a successful pilot, finding and funding five great people. We learned a lot of what worked, and what didn‚Äôt. We are asking to be trusted with more capital to bring more talented builders into the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nWe would like to run two more rounds of grants, as well as invest further in the project to attract more talented builders to the Nouns ecosystem through Explorer Grants.\n\n\n## Pilot Round Recap\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RMqi2Xs.jpg)\n \n\n_What our Explorers have done:_\n\n\n* [Greg](https://twitter.com/gregskril) - built Prop 249 (Solo Staking), built the Nouns API, and NounsList\n* [Drew](https://twitter.com/drewcoffman) - created valuable content about Nouns, crafted a thoughtful video and TikToks, gained Nouns delegation from Wilson and has been voting with reason consistently.\n* [Jackson](https://twitter.com/jackson_felty) - created cookbook.dev/nouns, running a workshop on how to build on Nouns\n* [Tigris](https://twitter.com/tigrisli) - built many, many, prototypes, wrapping up a proposal for Nouns hardware going on-chain after this!\n* Our fifth explorer had to put the grant on pause due to unforeseen work coming up. We are hopeful we can restart their grant or use it for someone else in the second pilot round.\n\nWhat we learned:\n\n\n\n- Grants are an excellent marketing tool for the DAO; by leaning into the funds that we were given, we were able to beat the record of applicants to a Nouns Prop House Round (90) and build a sizable following outside of Nouns, despite no previous traction. **_Therefore, every $ of the grants was used for two purposes: marketing the grant and the actual grant._** If the grants were smaller, we would have gotten less applicants.\n- There are amazing people waiting to be Nouns-pilled who just need a bit of help. Just in our first round, we had to reject amazing applicants who could have contributed great things to Nouns and just needed a bit of help. \n- We probably won‚Äôt get people to leave their jobs with large Explorer Grants (some of you can say _‚ÄúI told you so!‚Äù_ here). We got few applicants with full-time jobs, and participants who were not tied down to other responsibilities were often able to go deeper on Nouns. ***We want to give alternative, smaller Explorer Grants to talented builders who have other commitments, paired with hands-on support.***\n- Bringing people into Nouns takes time and effort - a lot of the people we talked to weren‚Äôt available at the moment, and ***building connections with prospective explorers takes time.*** This is similar to executive headhunting - not as straightforward as finding someone and giving them money.\n- ***Hack Week*** was a lot of fun and a great success with 90 ETH deployed, hundreds of participants, and dozens of new contributors to our community!\n\n## Goals for this round\n\n***Our #1 priority is to continue bringing top talent into Nouns.***  We want to fund 5x as many builders while maintaining the quality of the Pilot Round - we have an ongoing list of people who were highly interested but unavailable during our original application period. We‚Äôll continue our main grants by doing two cycles of 6 grants of 6 ETH each. We may also use Prop House‚Äôs infinite rounds to run part of our smaller Explorer Grants, which Nouners will be voting on. \n\nOther objectives:\n\n\n\n- **Re-invest into the EG talent pipeline:** build out a community, build out a strong decentralized brand for Explorer Grants, and create content that brings in more talent from outside of Nouns. This will require paying people outside of the main team.\n- **Contribute to the Nouns dev ecosystem:** we ran Nouns Hack Week and would like to continue efforts like it, build out content for Nouns builders as a whole, and be stewards of Nouns contributors. \n- **Participate in governance:** we‚Äôd like 1 Noun to support Explorers and Builders (we are currently paying for delegation). This also doubles as an equity-like payment to the Explorer Grants team so that we can share in the upside of Nouns. None of us own Nouns.\n\n### Ask\n* Grants: 100 ETH\n    * Regular (via application cycles): 12 x 6 = 72 ETH\n    * Small (via Infinite Rounds + by team): 14 x 2 ETH = 28 ETH\n* Growth / Reinvesting - Community, Content, Brand, Operational: 10 ETH\n* Team Compensation: 15 ETH / month for six months\n* 1 Noun\nTotal: 200 ETH + 1 Noun",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 266 - The Nouns Mechanical Keyboard",
      "content": "# The Nouns Mechanical Keyboard\n\n![teaser_MK](https://i.imgur.com/vcoWIpm.jpg)\n[Not a real design, for marketing only. Better design plan below.]\n\n---\n\nAs one of the primary means of interacting with our online world, keyboards are more than just a tool ‚Äì they've become a personal expression. Until Neuralink becomes available, let's design a keyboard that we love to use every time!\n\nNextMech and I are excited to create a Nounish Mechanical Keyboard (MK) in collaboration with a top tier keyboard designers. With our internal MK knowledge and technical ability, we have planned a project that ultimately launches a Nouns sub-DAO for an enthusiastic subculture!\n\n### Overview\n\nOver the years, [an online subculture has emerged (partial MK ecosystem stats)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing) that cherishes their custom keyboards as works of art. This community has developed its own workflow called the group buy, where artists share designs for collectors to pre-order. After pooling the funds, the designer approaches a vendor to manufacture and deliver the product. Similar to web3, projects are decentralized across social media and different websites, [and they also have meetups around the world](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query)! Using the existing manufacturing infrastructure, we can improve the UX by utilizing NFTs, DAOs, and open-source software, to bridge the two communities!\n\n![MK_meet](https://i.imgur.com/p8ph93F.jpg)\n[SF meet March 5th 2023 with a photoshoped Nouns MK - [original photo](https://twitter.com/villi/status/1632132746029182977)]\nOther meetups can be seen by searching for [\"mechanical keyboard meet\"](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22mechanical%20keyboard%20meet%22&src=typed_query).\n\n### Us\n\nNextMech and I (profish) began working on a project called Mechies which won a small prize in a 2022 Australian hackathon. We thought about MK NFTs in the form of generative art with manufacturable traits, DAOs as Vendors for group buys, hardware-embedded signatures, etc., to help improve the ecosystem. Then, at the beginning of this year, we were introduced to [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami) through a buildoors group in Australia. He told us about the profound model of Nouns, and it quickly became clear that a collaboration would help proliferate the brand and support the MK subculture. His tremendous support and knowledge has helped shape a sustainable plan for this project!\n\n### Nouns x MKs\n\nThe proliferation synergizes immediately with existing channels. For example, the Nouns Esports team could incorporate the keycaps in their battle stations which would reach gaming spectators - expression of support have been made for collaboration. Or, Nouns keycaps can be given as POAPs to hackathon participants and winners, Nouns keyboards would be taken to keyboard meet ups around the world, photos of Nouns keyboards and keycaps will be showcased on popular online forum with millions of visitors, and so on. But we plan to go further than these channels and use Zora's Nouns Builder to create a MK DAO and continue to support MK enthusiasts!\n\n### Future\n\nThe MK DAO and the general infrastructure supported by this grant can become a platform that improves group buys for designers and collectors. Designers can leverage NFTs to offer their work as mints. They can go further by turning their existing Discord communities into DAOs, where the community can have greater input and ownership in the products they purchase. Also, the collectors who mint these designs benefit from the social media integration of NFTs, for better showcasing of their collections. In fact, we have already begun curating this platform by commissioning different MK artists in the current process, with many more collaborations in the pipeline!\n\nAlso, a long-term experiment that we are considering involves addressing IP issues in the ecosystem. [Designers face a challenge in protecting their intellectual property (IP) when running group buys](https://www.theverge.com/22905351/mechanical-keyboard-keycap-clones-imitators-knockoffs-olivia-biip). While stopping counterfeits for keycaps and general products is very difficult, authenticating the keyboards may be feasible. By using [VIA, an open-source software integrated with all keyboards](https://www.caniusevia.com/) and working with manufacturers, we could link keyboards to NFTs for potentially increasing their social and monetary value for collectors.\n\n### Summary Plan\n\nWe will work with a top tier MK designer and manufacture the keyboards for the NFT minters. We aim to sell and manufacture 1-2k units with a unique marketing strategy that involves selling keycaps of various sorts to complement the keyboard. This provides an incentive for us to proliferate Nouns, reduce prices and gather foundational members for the MK DAO!\n\nFinally, the entirety of this project will be a great example of real-world adoption for NFTs, especially with the new [EIPs for physical NFTs](https://medium.com/@ABCDE.com/abcde-after-studying-all-eips-we-summarized-9-future-directions-of-nfts-648c11f16a4f). It will be a major win for Nouns to be early and supportive of a devoted subculture that is growing! Take, for example, the subscriber count for the /r/MechanicalKeyboards subreddit:\n![MK_subreddit_stats](https://i.imgur.com/ynIRz2l.png)\n[Here is a small data set that we have gathered on the ecosystem to provide more context.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15W-Io9Y8zjAwppzKt9UkSLhiGImyQgc8J9M1UUUvh6o/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**With that said, here is a simple cost breakdown to make it all possible. We have already begun tracking expenses in our Notion and will continue to do so for the rest of the project. If there is a surplus we will allocate to other productive activities that further the project. More detailed breakdown and Q&A at the end:**\n\n- 52 ETH for manufacturing setup of however many mints but a guaranteed amount of 260 units including buffer, prototypes and YouTuber review units. With couple hundred spare keycap sets.\n- 10 ETH for assembling (80+ hours of labor), storage until redemption and safe high priority shipping.\n- 21.69 ETH for marketing of digital and physical assets including keycap airdrops of various different types.\n- 35 ETH for team and contractors, managing production, technical, graphics and starting/supporting the MK DAO.\n\n**Total - 118.69 ETH**\n\n---\n---\n## Detailed Plan\nCustom keyboard manufacturing involves two main components: the case and keycap set. Switches and other components are also significant, but they are less customizable; therefore, we will simply use enthusiast-grade products. For a more detailed overview of mechanical keyboards, [check out this intro made by NextMech](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gRH83pF1RBXW6Eve_OLC9Fb7hAlxQQEP/view?usp=sharing).\n\nTo start, a designer will incorporate the Nouns brand into the keyboard canvas. We are considering a collaboration with several designer who can create an aesthetic Nouns-themed keyboard. These designers can combine the MK culture and Nouns brand for a pleasing design. These include [BIIP](https://instagram.com/biipmk), [NoPunIn10Did](https://nopunin10did.com/kat-napoleonic/), [sourmk](https://www.instagram.com/sourmk), pikku-allu, dededecline who would be able to combine different themes into their work. Also, a design by a top artist plays a major role for introducing Nouns to the MK community, ensuring a high-quality product that enthusiasts will enjoy. Here are some of the works by the mentioned designers:\n\n![biip_dots](https://i.imgur.com/6WupSai.jpg)\n[BIIP Dots]\n![Pikku_allu](https://i.imgur.com/EsoOGd7.jpg)\n[Pikku Allu Symbiote]\n![nopunin10did](https://i.imgur.com/mNWDioS.jpg)\n[nopunin10did DSS Late Harvet]\n![sourmk_dandy](https://i.imgur.com/fJDs1nY.jpg)\n[Sourmk Dandy]\n\nFor manufacturing, our first choice is a company that builds based on their available catalog of cases and can also assist with packaging and shipping. However, for a better quality design, we are prepared to carry out a more bespoke model by working with different suppliers. NextMech has experience with both approaches and after accounting for trade-offs and constraints, we are confident on delivering a high quality product. The bespoke approach will start at a higher unit cost, but it's still within the financial plan. Also, it's well worth trading off additional costs for a better design!\n\nAfter finalizing the design, we will begin reviewing prototypes from the manufacturer(s) to confirm the colors and build quality. This will give us the confidence to replicate the design as an NFT, one that will be minted through after a project update. The mint will be priced at approximately 0.3-0.4 ETH depending on final unit cost and ETH price, with a discount for Nouns holders which brings price to near cost. It will have boolean-based redemption on [nouns.mk](https://nouns.MK) since we don't want to burn the NFT so that it can be shared online, and also allows for over the air updates through VIA software.\n\nPrior to and during the minting of the NFTs, we will launch marketing efforts to increase the visibility of the project. Proliferating the brand through community activity which also aligns with our incentive to reduce unit costs. A portion of the mint will be used to help start the MK DAO built using Zora's Noun Builder. We will support the MK DAO by managing further collaboration and manufacturing processes. Also, in addition to the daily auctions for the DAO, people who participated in the physical marketing events will gain access some access to the DAO.\n\nYou can start participating by [minting the momento NFT](https://zora.co/collections/0xbe11ce87505d41b6848f37cba26820d89b060a3e) where the glasses will be [magnetic](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cp0Q-juJ-_Y/?img_index=1)! Some participants will win this with their keyboard!\n[![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/06G1uuC.png)](https://zora.co/collections/0xbe11ce87505d41b6848f37cba26820d89b060a3e)\n\nThe physical marketing is in the style of MK communities, which will be on in addition to the digital media marketing. We are working on various exciting strategies for minters; some include resin keycaps with 3D Nouns characters inside, two piece magnetic and modular keycaps, novelty keycaps with Nouns themes, high-quality metallic keycaps, a fully custom 1/1 keyboard made for auction, hackathon POAP keycaps redeemed in person and more MK designer and influencer collaborations! These will have various pricing mechanisms to maximize accessibility for collectors and start the MK DAO.\n\nHere are some examples (not a real design) of a Nouns keycap NFT for physical marketing, which can be redeemed in the same way as the main keyboard NFT. It's a great addition to the custom keyboard once it arrives, or it allows MK enthusiasts to join the community with their existing keyboard!\n\n![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/xON1kBh.jpg)\n![noun_keycap_board](https://i.imgur.com/FFxttkm.png)\n[Not a real design, for conceptualization of single keycap only - by boardbay]\n\nOnce manufacturing, assembly, and quality testing are complete, the NFTs can be redeemed. They will be stored with a distributor or manufacturer and can be redeemed at any time. It is possible to sell the NFTs prior to redeeming them. \n\n### Current Progress\nAll progress will be made public on our Notion page, where we keep info that is up to date. Here are some highlights from the current progress:\n- Talking to two manufacturers and shared general idea to confirm production and timeline feasibility.\n- In contact with mentioned designers and discussing collaboration terms.\n- Quotes and plans on keycap marketing with various designers.\n- Registered [Nouns.mk](http://Nouns.mk), twitter account [@nounsmk](https://twitter.com/nounsmk), [nounsmk.eth](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth%3A0x144975eEc9674fd0Af3d6F3FBa8D660879cE3881) and nounsmkdao.eth.\n- Project outline and public workspace for the entirety of the project, with more details to be added as the project progresses.\n\n## Team and our MKs!\n**[Profish](https://twitter.com/profishcrypto) (product)**: My past experience is software engineering work for crypto trading companies and tokenomic simulations in cadCAD.

The building and marketing phase will be ongoing as the keycaps are mini NFT projects for the community. [Here is an early view of the timeline in our Notion, we will make it more accurate as we progress through the stages.](https://www.notion.so/5046938e65264b02b9d86c117289b98e).\n\n### Phase 1: Design\n- Start momento manufacturing for two piece magnetic keycap\n- Start commissions on physical marketing assets (1/1 keyboards, keycaps, NFC keycap, designer collab, keyboard head nouns for MK DAO, etc.)\n- Work with designer to finalize design (also communicating with manufacturer for feasibility)\n- Replicate keyboard design as an NFT\n- Update [Nouns.mk](http://Nouns.MK) with final design and soft launch\n- Update task board and add more detailed overview given new information\n\n### Phase 2: Marketing\n\n- Release mint of redeemable keyboard NFT\n- Digital marketing assets based on keyboard design\n- Continuation of physical marketing\n- \n\n\n---\n\nTHIS PROP IS LONGER THAN THE MAX LENGTH FOR SNAPSHOT:\n\n Read the rest of the prop at https://nouns.wtf/vote/266",

      "content": "# Nouns Esports - CS:GO and Dota2 Rosters 2023\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vZjmkDE.png)\nWritten by: The Nouns Esports Pod\n\n**TLDR:** Nouns has established itself in tier one esports competition. Let's keep the momentum going! This is our opportunity at becoming a globally recognized legacy brand in esports.\n\n\n## Description\n\nOur aim is for Nouns DAO to become a tier one, legacy esports brand. To achieve that, we need to consistently support our top-tier professional esports teams. This proposal ensures ongoing financial backing and assistance for our teams during the 2023 season, enabling us to continue cultivating an impactful esports brand and fostering strong community support around it.\n\n#### **Why Esports?**\n- Global Audience\n    - 100,000+ regular viewers of the Nouns brand each month across multiple games\n    - 250,000+ hours watched of esports competitions, player streams, etc. featuring Nouns branding\n- Developing a community with passionate supporters and fans, providing a gateway to the broader Nouns ecosystem\n- Empower aspiring esports athletes with our organization's support and representation to excel professionally\n\n#### **Esports Pod Update** \n- Operating since [Proposal 119](https://nouns.wtf/vote/119)\n- Effectively managed the budget allocated by the DAO more details at [funds.nouns.gg](http://funds.nouns.gg/)\n    - Protected against ETH downturn over the last 7 months by converting ETH @ ~1650 in August to provide stability to players and org\n    - Currently maintaining a treasury of approximately $180k in USDC and ETH, with a significant portion already designated for approved proposals\n    - Upheld only using a maximum of 10% for operations\n        - We did one round of retrofunding for the past 7 months, with an average of ~$2900 total per contributor (distributed 60490 USDC among 21 contributors).\n- Attracting a multitude of partnership opportunities \n    - Esports native businesses who want to build with Nouns e.g. [WePlay Proposal 198](https://nouns.wtf/vote/198)\n    - Invited to a prestigious tournament circuit hosted by the world's leading esports company, featuring 16 elite teams, where each participating organization can earn up to $100K in incentives\n\n#### **Pod Success Stories**\n- Impressive performances and improvement from our teams & players\n    - Multiple tournament wins and Top 8 finishes\n    - Qualifying for some of the biggest events in the world\n- Over the past six months, we have supported [Aklo](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Smasher:Aklo), the world's 16th ranked Super Smash Bros. Melee player. Our assistance has enabled him to participate in a greater number of tournaments across the nation, and he has served as a commendable and positive ambassador for Nouns\n    - Check out the hype plays and skill from our [Aklo announcement video](https://twitter.com/nounsesports/status/1593699246636556288?s=20)\n    - *Witness when the crowd literally [carries Aklo out of the venue](https://twitter.com/nycmelee/status/1609379932714450944) after a big win in New York!*\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/4VrNR2P.jpg)](https://twitter.com/nycmelee/status/1609379932714450944)\n\n- We stepped in to sponsor a CS:GO team without financial backing, ensuring they could attend a crucial bootcamp ahead of one of their biggest events. Our support paid off when they competed in front of over 200,000 live viewers\n- Influencer Taki has gained a significant following on social media, including over 100,000 followers on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/soy_taki) and regularly streams to over a thousand people on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/soy_taki). Additionally, she has a substantial following on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/soy_takii) and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@soy_takii). Taki has embraced Nouns culture and has organized tournaments and promoted inclusivity\n- Pok√©mon Unite team finished second in the World Finals under the Nouns banner\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/d3cCw7s.jpg)\n\n#### **In the Pod Pipeline**\n- Merchandise\n    - Gaming jerseys in production. Instead of traditional sponsors (*cough, betting*) we are taking the sub communities of Nouns along with us to competitions\n    - [Nouns.gg](https://nouns.gg/) can be used to redirect to various nounish websites during events. (e.g. prop.house or nounish.world)\n    - Regular merch in production for fans\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/igYrXbV.jpg)\n- Proof of Gamer ([pog.nouns.gg](https://pog.nouns.gg/nounsesports/creations))\n    - A platform that merges esports highlight clips and governance\n        - Built by [collective](https://collective.xyz/), the team behind [That's Gnarly ](http://thatsgnar.ly/)\n    - Revenue split between esports initiatives and the creator\n    - Great for onboarding\n- Continued support for our teams, players, and new initiatives\n\n## Teams\n---\n## **Dota 2**\n#### **Why Dota?**\nWatch our [recap video](https://youtu.be/-xDMn9zGzvk) of the first 6 months of Nouns Dota.\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/a1kTkVy.png)](https://youtu.be/-xDMn9zGzvk)\n\n- Dota is one of the most popular esports in the world, with a rich competitive history (20+ years)\n    - 400,000 - 1,000,000 concurrent players at any given time\n    - [The International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(Dota_2)), the annual culmination of the Dota Pro Circuit, is the single largest prize pool tournament in the world (last year's purse was almost $19 million USD)\n- We began supporting this roster with [Proposal #68](https://nouns.wtf/vote/68) and our team is currently ranked 14th in the world (top 3 NA!)\n- In game branding (*[It has people talkin'!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5BbzNHrehA)*)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Hm0FD5l.gif)\n\n#### **Placements**\n\n- Past results\n    - 1st place BTS Pro Series Americas 11\n    - 2nd place The International 2022: North America Qualifier\n    - 3rd place DPC NA 2021/2022 Tour 3: Division I\n    - 3rd place in DPC NA 2023 Tour 1: Division I\n- Qualified For (Upcoming)\n    - **Dota Pro Circuit** [qualifier for The International and Majors]\n    - **DreamLeague** [$1 million tournament hosted in Europe]\n\n#### **Schedule of Events**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6SLxPSo.png)\n\n## Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\n\n#### **Why CS:GO?**\nWatch an [interview with Coach Semphis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwy_Dr-BKU) prior to our first RMR experience with the team\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/XsthGQj.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFwy_Dr-BKU)\n- Regular opportunity for international competition\n    - Our high mark for live viewership during the last season was at the IEM Road to Rio\n        - Nouns vs Imperial peaked at 226,000 concurrent viewers\n        - Unique viewers are typically 3-4x concurrent\n- Currently rank 24th in the world! \n- Opportunity for permanent branding inside of one of the most popular games\n    - Teams that qualify for the major have the opportunity to create their own in-game sticker, which becomes a permanent part of the game and can be traded indefinitely. These stickers are applied as decorations to in-game items\n    - The CSGO skins marketplace, dubbed as the \"original NFT market\", is now worth billions (with millions in daily volume)\n    - *CSGO Stickers would be similar to what we've already achieved in Dota. The below Team Sticker is already in the game from our participation in [The International 2022](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/TheInternational/2022/LastChanceQualifier)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qxWP4gw.png)\n\n#### **Placements**\n- Past results\n    - 1st place Ace North American masters\n    - 1st place Intel Extreme Masters Dallas: NA Qualifier\n    - 1st place CCT NA Series #3\n    - 1st place ESEA Cash Cup: NA Winter #2\n    - 2nd place ESEA Cash Cup: Na Winter #1\n    - 3rd place EPL Na Conference\n    - 2nd place CCT NA Series #2\n    - 2nd place ESL Challenger League Season 42 NA\n    - 2nd place Fireleague 2022 NA\n- Qualified For (Upcoming)\n    - **IEM Dallas 2023** [international event]\n    - **BlastTV Paris Major 2023: North American RMR** [sticker potential]\n    - **CCT Finals** [$200k purse and potential LAN]\n    \n#### **Schedule of Events**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TmVczHQ.png)\n\n## Event Spotlights\n\n**Dota Pro Circuit**\nThe regular season format that is stepping stones to The International. The 2023 Summer Season will begin in May and culminates with a Major in Bali in late June.\n\n**DreamLeague Season 19**\nOur Dota team was invited to a 1 million dollar tournament as one of the 16 best teams in the world. This tournament circuit is ran by ESL, the biggest esports company in the world. Our success at this event will allow us to participate in a 15 million dollar grand final later this year.\n![](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/sDgIIzb2UMj-OTHG8G4POauhmFeRE95o3oartDmdi84/https/pbs.twimg.com/media/FrqIBzJWYAEvYSZ.jpg)\n\n**Blast Paris Major 2023 North American RMR** \nThe Counter Strike sticker opportunity. Our team is in Monterrey Mexico, competing against top teams from the Americas for a spot at the [Paris Major](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/BLAST/Major/2023/Paris) in May.\n\n**IEM Dallas**\nOur CSGO team has qualified for IEM Dallas starting May 29th. IEM Dallas is an S-Tier event just barely below a Major. It will pit Nouns against the worlds best international teams, with hundreds of thousands of viewers. 2022's iteration (pictured below) had over 12.5 million hours watched and a crowd seating thousands.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DmQCdf3.png)\n\n## Proposal Success Metrics & Vision\n\n- Tournament wins and participation\n    - Continuing to compete at some of the biggest tournaments in the world, such as Majors and The International\n- Viewership \n    - Due to the success of our teams we expect to be at significantly more tier one events than last year. Regular 10K to 100K+ viewership is expected\n    - The highest view count so far was 200.000+ live viewers during a nail-biting series against MiBR at the CS:GO NA RMR\n- Social media growth\n    - Approaching 7000 followers on our main Twitter account & multiple of our players have over 50k followers\n    - Discord server with 2400 members in total and a growing group of active contributors\n- In-game branding\n    - Dota will continue to have Nouns assets thanks to participation in the Pro Circuit\n    - In CS, we need to qualify for an upcoming Major, doing so would guarantee permanent Nounish branding inside of the game\n- Acquiring additional partners aligned to our Nounish ethos\n    - We'll seek partners that share our values and vision for long-term growth, prioritizing alignment with our Nounish ethos\n    -  Nouns Esports can have multiple sponsors supporting our competitive initiative, and we will prioritize aligning with sponsors that share our values and vision for long-term growth\n- Onboarding\n    - Gamers have typically been wary of the crypto space due to a lack of understanding and perceived complexity. However, the similarities between the gaming and crypto ecosystems, such as digital ownership and online communities, make them well-suited for each other\n    - Nounish culture extended into esports has proven to be an amazing onboarding tool and we believe we can bridge the gap between gaming and crypto, showing gamers the potential benefits of crypto and its applications in and beyond the gaming world\n\n\n## Risks and Challenges\n\nAs an organization, it's crucial to consider the potential risks associated with discontinuing support for our esports teams. These teams are not just a source of entertainment for the community but also a representation of our brand and values. If we abruptly stop supporting them, we risk losing the trust and loyalty of the community we have worked hard to build.\n\nAnother challenge that esports teams face is potential fluctuations in performance during the competitive season. To mitigate this risk, it's important to provide necessary support expected of tier one rosters, including management, coaching, bootcamps, and wellness support. This helps maintain the players' focus, discipline, and motivation, especially during challenging times.\n\n## Budget\n\nFunding two professional esports teams for a minimum of 10 months.\n\n#### **Rosters**\n- 340,000 - 465,000 USDC\n    - Two teams consisting of five players and one coach (12 people in total)\n    - 125000 reserved for incentive payments, meaning it will be reflexive of the performance and effort put forth by the teams\n\n#### **Bootcamps** \n- 20,000-120,000 USDC\n- Funding the best practice opportunities prior to important competitions\n     - Considered an essential need for top esports rosters\n     - Costs may be reduced depending on the number of sponsored bootcamps (e.g. our Dota team has already received a free bootcamp in Europe during April, paid for by the organizers)\n\n#### **Support Staff**\n- 210,000 USDC\n    - We are providing industry-standard support staff for these rosters\n        - Two player managers who travel to events with the teams & organize their lives around regular competition\n        - Professional wellness staff \n        - Support staff for logistics, social media & content\n\n#### **Total: 795,000 USDC** (~435 ETH at current prices)\n---\n### **Multisig**\n\nWe will be using the same multisig that was created for [Proposal 119](https://nouns.wtf/vote/119) consisting of Nouners and Nounsfolk. We will be swapping in Esports Pod member Peter as an active signer.\n\n- Sasquatch\n- Brennen\n- Maty\n- Oni\n- [Peter](https://twitter.com/Peterpandam) (Former [Dota Pro](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Ppd), winner of The International, and previously CEO of [Evil Geniuses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_Geniuses))\n\n## Esports, Introduced\nWe have recently created a fun & free open edition to celebrate Nouns Esports, which has been minted over 10,000 times (with a limit of 1 per wallet)! \n- *We have re-opened the mint for the duration of this proposal, you can find it at [mint.nouns.gg](mint.nouns.gg)*\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/FaWnq7c.png)](http://mint.nouns.gg)\n\n## Conclusion (ChatGPT TLDR)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/isBe9fx.png)\n\n#### **Thank you for reading!**",

We received coverage from [**Animation Magazine**](https://www.animationmagazine.net/2023/03/stoopid-buddy-teams-with-nouns-dao-to-fund-nft-inspired-short-shorts/) and have a simple [**Nouns Stories**](http://nounsstories.wtf/) website with further links.\n\n5 of these animators were selected through our [**Prop House round**](https://prop.house/nouns-stories/nouns-short-shorts-season-1), which is now complete. We had 67 wildly talented applicants offering a variety of animation styles: 2D, 3D, stop motion, mixed media. The Prop House link has all of the submissions, including the 5 winners.\n\nAt the same time, our team commissioned 5 additional animators from our personal networks. We are excited to announce them - they are fantastic animators with significant careers and social followings. After this proposal we will announce all animators together in a press release.\n\nBoth the Prop House round and commissions have successfully caught the attention of world-class animators. We are onboarding some very talented people to Nouns, even helping some set up their first crypto wallets. It feels like we've hit on something special.\n\n## FUNDING MORE SHORT SHORTS\n\nMany great creators applied to the Prop House round and selecting only 5 was a challenge. We would love to fund a few additional Short Shorts from this pool of talent, as well as commission some more from our own networks. This extra animated content will be very useful for the IRL film festival we're planning.\n\nWe're looking for $52,500 USDC to fund 7 more animations:\n\n - 5 additional Prop House shorts ($7500 USDC x 5)\n - 2 additional comissioned shorts ($7500 USDC x 2)\n\n## HOSTING IRL FESTIVAL IN LA\n\nExcited by the caliber of animators, we would like to rent a venue in Los Angeles and host an IRL festival event. The organizing team has significant connections in the LA Animation / Film industries and we plan to invite our professional networks, friends, and the general public to enjoy some Short Shorts and learn about Nouns. We will screen all of the commissioned animations and other Nounish videos. The event will be livestreamed for anyone around the world to enjoy.\n\nThe budget will cover things like venue rental, event staff, audiovisual equipment, food/drink, and further marketing costs as they pop up.\n\nIRL Festival budget - $12,500 USDC\n\n## THE FUTURE\n\nThis first round of animations and the festival event are a pilot for a decentralized, CC0 Nouns festival dream. We intend to develop Nouns Short Shorts into a recurring global phenomenon, an infinite stream of animated Nounish content.\n\n## BUDGET\n\n7 x Short Shorts - $52,500 USDC\nLA Festival Budget - $12,500 USDC\n\n**TOTAL:** $65,000 USDC",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 258 - Nouns x W3BSTOCK in NOUN YORK CITY!!!!",
      "content": "# Nouns x W3BSTOCK in NOUN YORK CITY!!!!\n\n### Preface\nI'm sponsoring this prop because I believe in the initiative, but have no involvement beyond sponsorship. Please direct any questions and conversation to the builders proposing - Brian and Bloomz.\n\n\n## TLDR \n\nWe're requesting 10 ETH to make Nouns DAO a Title Partner of W3BSTOCK NYC, a global live entertainment consortium that empowers artists and revolutionizes the music industry using blockchain technology. By partnering with W3BSTOCK, Nouns DAO will gain significant exposure and align itself with the top-tier global web3 music and arts ecosystem, which is growing rapidly in New York City. The partnership will involve Noun-focused activations, merchandise, and branding throughout the event, targeting a diverse audience of over 1,500 attendees, and providing long-term value to the Nouns community.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZaAkO29.jpg)\n\n## Intro\n\nNOUN YORK CITY 2023!!!\n\nGM Fellow Nouners! \n\nAt W3BSTOCK, our core mission is to proliferate live music and beautiful art into a wider consciousness while providing creators with the tools to pave a more equitable music industry. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, we are spreading education around these tools and showing creators how to drive new forms of revenue, fan engagement, and artistic expression. We believe that by empowering artists, we empower the world, disrupting the outdated music industry and creating a more vibrant and equitable future for all involved. We would LOVE for the Nouns DAO to join us on this exciting journey to revolutionize the world of music and art.\n\nWe are a NYC-based, global live entertainment consortium powering the decentralized music industry, with a core team from diverse live entertainment production entities like Brooklyn Bowl, Relix Magazine, The Capitol Theatre, Lockn' Music Festival, Central Park Summerstage and Universal Music and from artistic and musical members of bluechip NFT communities like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Crypto Punks (Spottie Wifi is in the DAO), Gutter Cat Gang, Nouns, Lil Nouns, The Visitors, The Alien Boy, and many more. Our organization integrates best-in-class web3 tools and communities to produce concerts, music festivals and other meaningful, memorable experiences in real life, all doubled in the metaverse, all framed around a global mission to fix the live music industry through blockchain to create a better future for creators, venues, event organizers and fans. \n\nFollowing the successful Nouns activations at W3BSTOCK Miami on December 1st, 2022 and the W3BSTOCK x Lil Nouns Denver party on March 4th, 2023. We now have the opportunity for Nouns to make a lasting impression within the W3BSTOCK live music and arts ecosystem, which will reverberate across the thriving New York City web3 community in the artistic and musical epicenter of NFT.NYC and beyond. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Y0Cyr22.jpg)\n\n## Event \n\nW3BSTOCK will kick off NFT.NYC this year on the eve of the conference, Tuesday, April 11th with a massive event bringing together over 40 leading music acts from the web3 music ecosystem like Dyl, Rae Isla, Domino, Violetta Zironi, Nifty Sax, The CART3L, Fifi Rong, Jadyn Violet, and Taylor Alexander, and over 30 high profile NFT tastemakers like Dave Krugman / ALLSHIPS, KYD Labs, Aptos, Metasill, Tokenprooof, and many more - This is the biggest lineup of web3 artists playing a single stage in history and we have the opportunity to get the Nouns DAO front and center of not only the NYC event, but the big picture mission at the core of W3BSTOCK: To proliferate live music and beautiful art into a wider consciousness.\n\nW3BSTOCK was hands down the most popular music and art event the day before NFT NYC last year and I expect this year will be no different. With an expected attendance of over 30,000 attendees at NFT.NYC this year, W3BSTOCK realistically projects an attendance of over 1,500 educated, diverse attendees for their event, including in-person attendees and metaverse attendees with organic social media impressions exceeding 20,000. \n\n**Note:** the vast majority of the NYC web3 music community are NOT widely aware of the Nouns DAO and what we are doing - hence the opportunity.\n\nThis is an unprecedented opportunity to align the Nouns community with the top tier global web3 music and arts ecosystem that is emerging from New York and rapidly spreading around the world. We will onboard new community members from the W3BSTOCK music and art community into the Nouns DAO, and we will ensure that the Nouns are tethered inextricably to the paradigm shift that is just beginning for artists and creators. \n\nThis is a different type of NFT event. It is solely focused on live music, beautiful performances, and interactive art activations, rather than a dry panel of speakers or a bunch of speculative crypto bros. \n\nW3BSTOCK has already proliferated incredible web3-enabled music and arts programming in New York, Las Vegas, Miami and London, with forthcoming parties coming up at Bitcoin 2022 in May and at W3BSTOCK Sydney in August. For this reason, I would like Nouns to have a leading presence at this event, so that the Nouns will continue to be a leading cultural tastemaker in this good-to-grey web3 music ecosystem over the long term.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7JLOGHx.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Rq4b0gB.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P8n3obSl.jpg)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QpTuXL3l.png)\n\n\n## Description\n\nWe are requesting 10 ETH for **Nouns** to become a **Title Partner** of W3BSTOCK NYC with a complete Nounish takeover of the entire event, including a fully Nounish Photo Booth with a direct social media integration. We will also get Noggles on leading web3 music influencers like Dyl, Violetta Zironi, Rae Isla, and more, on the eve of the conference so they can rock them for the remainder of NFT week and aid in the cultural Nouns proliferation. This will make a large splash and kick off a week of Nounish proliferation at NFT NYC and will also generate loads of awareness for Nouns DAO and their mission.\n\nThe funding breakdown will be as follows:\n\n10 ETH For Title Partnership that will get us:\n* Premiere, exclusive sponsorship of the event which would make it the official Nouns NFT NYC kickoff event\n*  20‚Äôx20‚Äô Official Tastemaker IRL Vendor Booth, placed prominently at the main entrance to the event with 2 dedicated 33‚Äù Metasill screen and projector to display Nouns NFTs at the front and center of the event\n*   Allow Nouns to curate parts of the event **designing high end fabricated scenes for the photo booth and other pop up activations** at areas all across the event venue\n*   A Nounish photo booth with direct social media integration and a pre-made tweet / IG template that has Nouns tagged. We will offer a free NFT claim to anyone who posts a Nounish photo and tags the Nouns to incentivize an online network effect, and we will offer future utility to these holders at future events within the music and arts web3 ecosystem\n*    100 comps for Nouns holders - which grants access to the immersive VIP Groove Room, open bar, and on site swag and other giveaways\n* Nouns featured with top, premiere placement on invite and promo materials \n* Nouns featured prominently in signage at the event\n* Nouns inspired specialty cocktail on bar menu\n* Branding and link to Nouns.wtf in the Metaverse livestream component of the event\n* Branding across social assets\n* Branding on emails linked to the event\n\n* 50 custom Nouns x W3BSTOCK t-shirts to be given away to holders (first come, first served)\n* 8‚Äô x 8‚Äô Nouns @ W3BSTOCK Step-and-Repeat \n* 47‚Äù x 81‚Äù Nouns Retractable Banner (which we will carry around and display at multiple events throughout NFT NYC) \n* Noggles for swag bag and for handing out across NFT NYC \n* W3BSTOCK-included VIP table for Nouns community at Nolcha Shows x Crypto Punks event with 3,000 attendees on Weds, April 12th\n* A **guaranteed Nounish activation at the W3BSTOCK x Nolcha Shows** party at the SLS South Beach during Bitcoin 2023 on May 25\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wUNMk3p.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RDfdQaR.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NOT5FzY.jpg)\n\n## ROI To The DAO:\n\nI will show the DAO several returns on investment from this activation from financial, to brand awareness, to growth marketing. I will be collecting data via POAP mints, distributed merch to holders, and social media impressions. We will keep a thorough list of tags on every social platform, Nouns.wtf and nouns.wft link visits during the week, and will provide a full write-up on all of the nounish interactions with artists and creators and the W3BSTOCK event and across NFT NYC. \n\nI will provide a total of **3 reports to the DAO**. The reports will provide **follow up analytics after 7 days, 30 days and 90 days**. The stats I will be tracking are:\n\n‚Ä¢**Branding and proliferation** of Noggles all across NFT.NYC with an estimated 20,000 organic social impressions\n‚Ä¢ **Hundreds of photos** of W3BSTOCK and Nouns and other nounish people at the step-and-repeat including leading web3 music and cultural influencers\n‚Ä¢ **Website Traffic** to Nouns.wtf \n‚Ä¢ **Purchases** - We will have a number of POAP kiosks throughout the event where attendees will mint our Nouns @ W3BSTOCK NFT NYC POAP. Through this, we will have a list of wallet addresses that I will then check those addresses at the 7 day, 30 day and 90 day checkpoints to see if any of those wallet addresses now own a Noun (purchased after the event date)\n‚Ä¢ **Photos** either tagging Lil Nouns or Nouns and/or containing Noggles, pulled from every social media platform at 30, 90 and 180s out from the event.\n‚Ä¢ **Aggregated brand impressions** from all social media, web visits and NFT purchases post event at each checkpoint\n\nBy proliferating Nouns and Lil Nouns at W3BSTOCK Miami and also our collab Denver event, and also knowing all about W3BSTOCK last NYC event at the same venue, I have been able to see first hand how to best proliferate the nounish brands among the W3BSTOCK arts and music ecosystem. The biggest impacts include:\n\n‚Ä¢ **Interactive art**, screens and live minting POAP experiences, and step-and-repeat activations\n‚Ä¢ **A strong presence** at the event with a premium booth & Noun maxis to chat with & answer questions\n‚Ä¢ **Live music** - This has been oft overlooked in building the Nouns communities and I believe we have massively untapped awareness within the thriving web3 NYC music and arts web3 scene - This proposal will instantly fix that\n‚Ä¢ **Branded tote gift bags** handed out to holders \n‚Ä¢ **Stickers** - people love collecting stickers and we saw tons of them up around various places in Miami and Denver\n‚Ä¢ **T-shirts** - Branded W3BSTOCK x Nouns t-shirts turn attendees into marketing evangelists, and people who come to events and have a great time (like, all of them) are happy to wear merch around to other events at conferences and also post on social media ‚Ä®\n\nIf this proposal is funded we will officially be partnering with the first-to-market and leading web3 music and arts ecosystem which is thriving in New York City. This will allow allow for nounish proliferation over an entire week, not only in W3BSTOCK‚Äôs live music and arts ecosystem, but in and around the largest NFT conference in the entire world, in the greatest city in the world, **NOUN YORK CITY!!!!**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe music industry has long been plagued by problems that hurt artists and fans, and this is the most ripe space for blockchain disruption, and this particular use case and demographic has been largely overlooked by the Nouns DAO .... until now. \n\nWe believe that blockchain technology is poised to create a more equitable future for artists, fans, and industry professionals alike. By leveraging the power of blockchain, we're able to provide a platform that enables direct artist-to-fan engagement and fair revenue distribution, cutting out middlemen and gatekeepers who have historically taken a large chunk of the profits. Our organization also provides creators with new ways to monetize their work, such as through NFTs and fan token offerings, creating new forms of revenue streams that were previously unavailable.\n\nLike the Nouns, at W3BSTOCK, we're not just speculating about the possibilities of blockchain technology - we're making it a reality. This is why we believe that a partnership like this would represent such a mutual value and bear very long term fruit for the Nouns and independent creators across the globe. \n\nI believe that one of the core focuses in our shared goal of proliferation the Nouns DAO should be empowering creators, and what better way than to proliferate Nouns to artists and musicians? These are the truest arbiters of culture. Musicians and artists say what is cool, they define culture. We get leading web3 artists and musicians rocking the Nouns brand ... and the world will follow. \n\nBy getting involved with W3BSTOCK, we'll be at the forefront of a music, art, and creator revolution, disrupting the outmoded music industry and creating a more equitable future for all involved. \n\nThank you for considering this proposal, and here's to a brighter future for music, art and the world!\n\n## Team \n\n* **Brian Stollery** - Hi!

Let‚Äôs be where developers, creatives, and entrepreneurs gather to build. The Nouns Fair is the space to have fun, experience culture, build, and proliferate Nouns all at once!\n\n## WTF?\n\n> **The Nouns Fair is an IRL experience that aims to spread Nouns among hackers and builders in web3.**\n\nAs ETHGlobal states, they are growing the most valuable developer community in web3. At their hackathons, engineers, designers, and product leaders come together for three days to collaborate on building something amazing. The Nouns Fair is a dedicated space for them inside the hackathon where we create a fun nounish atmosphere. This makes Nouns associated with a positive and memorable experience.\n\nThe Nouns Fair serves different purposes to help hackers learn about Nouns:\n\n- **Awareness** ‚Äì hackers taking pictures at our photo sets and wearing cool Nounish swag\n- **Learning** ‚Äì we spend three full days answering questions about all things nounish\n- **Building** ‚Äì there will be a pool of 5k in prizes for nounish projects\n\n> **The Nouns Fair is perfect for creating a builders‚Äô cycle on a weekend.\nAwareness > Learning > Building > Proliferation > Awareness > ‚Ä¶**\n\nWe can‚Äôt miss this opportunity to put Nouns in the eyes of thousands of talented hackers!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yiRMrzj.png)\n\n## So far‚Ä¶\n\nWe‚Äôve hosted three editions of the Nouns Fair at ETHGlobal hackathons: in Mexico, Colombia, and the USA. After three editions we've confirmed the importance of this kind of event to increase awareness, onboard potential builders, and put noggles in the eyes of thousands. \n\nWe managed to put Nouns and noggles in the eyes of:\n\n- 3,700 people in\n- 3 cities: Mexico City, Bogota, and San Francisco, during\n- 9 full days of nounishness with\n- 3 Nouns Fair editions\n\nAll this blended with the local culture:\n\n- Pi√±atas\n- Games\n- Candies\n- Fortune cookies with nounish luck and a\n- Nouns flower power VW bus\n\nWe also distributed nounish swag, including:\n\n- 800 t-shirts\n- 600 pins\n- 1,600 stickers\n- 400 POAPs\n\n**Nouns Fair Mexico**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uF8U2f9.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Fair Bogota**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7ZwmTqR.jpg)\n\n**Nouns Fair San Francisco**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Uv5vAcJ.jpg)\n\n**Want more photos?** Here are [our photobooks on Flickr ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://www.flickr.com/photos/196499305@N03/albums).\n\n**Want videos?** This is the vibe of each of the editions of the Nouns Fair!\n\n**Nouns Fair ETHMexico**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/4ZuQBNS.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRTegTUFwHM)\n\n**Nouns Fair ETHBogota**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/mMKxNuc.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe1R5WFT9_E)\n\n**Nouns Fair ETHSanFrancisco**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/FIi1QYh.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ij0MoUOV-OE)\n\n**Want more proliferation?** Since the Nouns Fair happens inside the hackathon, ETHGlobal video recaps have been nounified, putting ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®  in the eyes of the Ethereum community.\n\n**ETHMexico Recap**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/655mczu.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPNu1QTxC0w)\n\n**ETHBogota Recap**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/hbPrIn1.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMbtSPFB9j0)\n\n**ETHSanFrancisco Recap**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/Z5n7jdR.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHiIMvGLBZc)\n\n**Want more details?** Here are more detailed reports of each Nouns Fair edition on Discourse:\n\n- [Nouns Fair at ETHMexico report ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-nouns-fair-eth-mx/1777/6?u=mono) (Funded by NSFW)\n- [Nouns Fair at ETHBogota report ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326/7?u=mono) (Funded by NSFW)\n- [Nouns Fair at ETHSanFrancisco report ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethsanfrancisco/2709/4?u=mono) (Funded by NSFW and reimbursed via [on-chain ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://nouns.wtf/vote/162))\n\n**Want some alpha?** San Francisco's fair was used as the set for the Nouns Documentary ‚Äì hopefully, we'll make it to the cut üôä\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wZPO9lM.jpg)\n\n## What do people say about the Nouns Fair?\n\nHundreds of people have enjoyed previous editions of the Nouns Fair. Their faces of joy smashing pi√±atas, getting candies, winning a T-shirt for playing foosball and just having a good time taking pictures with giant noun heads and learning about Nouns says it all! ‚Äì We asked a few folks to tell us a bit of their experience at the Nouns Fair.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2ZWPge6.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3rH2ePX.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IJ8Esyu.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yHSz1Kp.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/48wpqHW.png)\n\n## What is the plan?\n\n**The Nouns Fair will be a cultural experience focused on builders where they will be able to engage with others, learn and build with Nouns.** These activations will be localized nounish experiences with photo opportunities, games, swag, and dedicated hosts answering every question about Nouns and building.\n\nWe want to keep onboarding international builders and help others create on top of Nouns. To do so, we plan to go to six IRL ETHGlobal hackathons forecasted for 2023.\n\n1. **[ETHGlobal Lisbon ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://ethglobal.com/events/lisbon)**: May 12 ‚Üí May 14 \n2. **[ETHGlobal Waterloo ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://ethglobal.com/events/waterloo2023)**: June 23 ‚Üí June 25\n3. **[ETHGlobal Paris ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://ethglobal.com/events/paris2023)**: July 21 ‚Üí July 23\n4. **[ETHGlobal New York ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://ethglobal.com/events/newyork2023)**: September 22 ‚Üí September 24\n5. **[ETHGlobal Istambul ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://ethglobal.com/events/istanbul)**: November (TBC)\n6. ETHGlobal Devcon: Q4 (TBC)\n\nCountries and dates may change during the year. We‚Äôll adjust accordingly as things unfold.\n\n**More info:** [Announcing the 2023 ETHGlobal Season article ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://ethglobal.medium.com/announcing-the-2023-ethglobal-season-3cc1960de7b4) / [Updates to the 2023 ETHGlobal Hackathon Season ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://ethglobal.medium.com/updates-to-the-2023-ethglobal-hackathon-season-1d2a9d418c91)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/X5XHeIZ.jpg)\n\n## What to expect?\n\nAfter three editions, we now know that making people's first experience with Nouns fun and meaningful makes the perfect environment to be receptive about wtf is Nouns, how the DAO works, and how people can collaborate. \n\nThis year we'll focus on making builders build with Nouns by doubling our efforts on incentivizing them to materialize their ideas with Nouns from the start. We‚Äôll introduce a new way to learn the nounish vibe and encourage people to build in-site with Nouns: the **Nouns Prize.**\n\n### **Nouns Prize ‚Äì wtf?**\n\nPeople hacking at the event will get a chance to learn about Nouns by going to the Nouns Fair inside the venue. They will learn they can build on top of Nouns immediately at the hackathon and be rewarded. This is a way to showcase the nounish vibe and incentivize the use of Nouns to build whatever they can imagine. Hundreds of hackers building with Nouns all at once like a massive Nouns Prop House flash round ‚Äì can you picture that?\n\nThis prize aims to reward builders that:\n\n1. Use Nouns art\n2. Build for the Nouns community\n3. Build public goods using Nouns\n\n**Doing this at every hackathon will help to a) have a dedicated window to onboard hundreds of skilled builders, b) get familiar with the Nouns‚Äô culture, and c) incentivize building constantly.** \n\n> **More builders, more props, more proliferation.**\n\nImagine hackers building with Nouns as they already do with protocols and tools like Polygon, Lens, MetaMask, Uniswap, Aave, etc.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b60kgr5.png)\n\n### Culture √° la Nounish\n\nThe Nouns Fair's experience results from great design, excellent execution, and blending of cultures. We wrap all this in a concept we call **culture √° la nounish**.\n\nWe've done it differently in each country. In Mexico City, we did it with rustic hand-painted fair stands, games, candies, and nouns pi√±atas. In Bogota, with a high-quality printed stage highlighting local cultural imagery along with traditional games, toys, and candies. And in San Francisco, with a 60's flower power VW bus and custom Chinese fortune cookies. All this with a pinch of swag. \n\nWe'll keep blending local culture with Nouns in this year's editions of the Nouns Fair. We're excited about the richness of culture this year's locations will bring.\n\n> **Proliferation and culture √° la nounish**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JIEHA7N.jpg)\n\n## What is the budget?\n\nWith the experience we‚Äôve had in the previous Fairs, we‚Äôve kept what works best and made some changes, adapting both to each city‚Äôs event expectations and social media needs + the Nouns Prize for hackers.\n\nTo make this reality, **we ask for $226,425 USDC worth in funding**, which we'll allocate as follows.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7MSFqnV.png)\n\n*Note 1: The Photo Set, Culture √† la Nounish, and Traveling & Accommodation sections are considering a 5% buffer to cover potential changes in prices and schedules throughout the year.*\n\n*Note 2: For security, all funds will be managed by a 3/5 Safe (0xFB35d8B136729D3aB74d687E482F3D16CE18d89C) including Ale, Mono, the Nouns Fair wallet, [Necfas ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://twitter.com/necfas), and [Franklin ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://twitter.com/franklinvargas).* \n\n## Who are we?\n\n- [Alejandra, Nouns Amigos nounder ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://twitter.com/ale_pjimenez)\n- [Mono, Nouns Amigos nounder ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://twitter.com/0xMonografia)\n\nWe want to turn the Nouns Fair into a vehicle that can proliferate and attract builders anywhere in the world. We've done it in three countries and want to keep adding more this year.\n\nWe are two nounders of Nouns Amigos, the community for all Spanish speakers. We onboard, encourage, and help our amigos to build with Nouns. We are nounifying Latin America and beyond.\n\nWe've been active with Nouns Amigos since June 2022. We've done weekly Twitter Spaces since then (now part of the regular TNS Soapbox schedule), three editions of the Nouns Fair, and [created Nouns Amigos hub in Prop House ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos) which has funded 19 props in two months including [two breakdancers that want to qualify for the Olympics in 2024 ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/ronda-1/3281), [a giant skateboarding noggles rail in the Dominican Republic ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/ronda-1/3360), [these Godzilla-size Nouns in the streets of Bogota ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/ronda-1/3368), [8 Meetups in 5 Latam countries ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/reuniones-a-la-nounish), [sponsored a sub-champion MBT racer ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/mantente-nounish/3748), [sponsored an Ethereum Guatemala conference ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://prop.house/nouns-amigos/mantente-nounish/3705) and [more ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://woolen-sapphire-e03.notion.site/January-March-2023-d4aceb12e9a44a56960bc8639afd5675)!\n\nBut most of all, we've gathered the Spanish community on [Twitter ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos) and [Discord ‚ÜóÔ∏é](https://discord.gg/MDvvuUkNYT) under Nouns Amigos!\n\n## FAQ\n\n- **In a tweet, what are you trying to do?**\nBring the Nouns Fair and introduce the Nouns Prize to six ETHGlobal IRL hackathons.

      "content": "# The First Triple Back Flip in a Wheelchair\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/fK4ZyaR.png](https://i.imgur.com/fK4ZyaR.png)\n\n**Hi, I‚Äôm [Noun 64](https://twitter.com/dorculas) üëã**\n\nIn this proposal, I want to create a unique and inspiring moment in time for all of Nouns to rally around. I believe Nouns is one of the best storytelling protocols as it provides the opportunity for anyone to add to that story in a very meaningful way to proliferate the meme. With Aaron ‚ÄúWheelz‚Äù Fotheringham and my team, we will create a story that will capture the hearts and minds of Nouners and people outside of the Nouns ecosystem alike and provide on-chain lore for future creatives to play around with.\n\n**TL;DR:**\n- Create a 5-7 minute Nounish documentary that dives into Wheelz' amazing story and follows him in his journey to do **the first triple back flip in a wheelchair**\n- Produce raw content and b-roll around the entire project to be released as CC0 on [everydayforever.wtf](http://everydayforever.wtf)\n- Upon completion, we will submit a droposal to have the documentary minted as an Open Edition where 50% of proceeds go to NounsDAO and the other 50% of proceeds go to Life Rolls On\n\n**Who is Wheelz?**\n[****Nikki Bella Gets EMOTIONAL As She Hits Her First Golden Buzzer For Aaron Wheelz!****]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5DI64O15Ow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5DI64O15Ow))\n![https://i.imgur.com/X7BNG4I.png](https://i.imgur.com/X7BNG4I.png)\n\n[****Aaron \"Wheelz\" Fotheringham INSANE Wheelchair Athlete Top Moments in Nitro Circus History****]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7tsMVnvrw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw7tsMVnvrw))\n![https://i.imgur.com/DZDkKRm.png](https://i.imgur.com/DZDkKRm.png)\n\nWhen I first started ideating what I wanted to do with my first proposal, I thought back on all of the people I‚Äôve met that resonated with my interpretation of the idea of Nounishness and Wheelz was one of the first people I thought of. He‚Äôs an incredibly genuine human that lives life in an absolutely full send way. He‚Äôs been on tour with Nitro Circus, participated in X Games, holds multiple Guinness World Records and has been featured on ESPN, CNN, and Bleacher Report.\n\nI asked him one day, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs something crazy you want to do?‚Äù He responded with, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve wanted to do the first triple back flip in a wheelchair for a while now but haven‚Äôt gotten the time to work on it.‚Äù I got goosebumps and immediately started figuring out how we could make this reality.\n\n**What are we doing with Wheelz?**\n\nWe will create a Nounish documentary that follows Wheelz through the journey of executing **the first triple back flip on a wheelchair**. A doc that gives you a window into Wheelz‚Äô story and the story of him doing the unimaginable - filled with joy and perseverance but doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously. This story will serve as a piece of Nouns lore to be enjoyed and to be forked for future Nounish content.\n\nTo execute this, we will first need a mega ramp. Luckily, we‚Äôve connected with a mega ramp builder that has built ramps for the likes of X Games and Nitro Circus and he‚Äôs willing to rent his ramp to us for our short doc.\n\nHere‚Äôs the crazy 30-foot mega ramp that we would be using:\n\n![https://i.imgur.com/eWSeRKg.png](https://i.imgur.com/eWSeRKg.png)\n\nThe ramp is awesome, right? Next, we need a team that is capable of producing a Nounish documentary. This is why I‚Äôm bringing in Zack Patrick - who is a talented friend of mine that can handle all aspects of this documentary from the action sports videography to the drone footage to the storytelling. Below you can find some of his amazing work:\n\n[****The Art of Surfing (Sponsored by Jackery)****]([https://vimeo.com/721340785](https://vimeo.com/721340785))\n![https://i.imgur.com/7UtbK0L.png](https://i.imgur.com/7UtbK0L.png)\n\n[****Can I Kick It? (Nike Soccer Spec - shot on Red Komodo)****]([https://vimeo.com/795679611](https://vimeo.com/795679611))\n![https://i.imgur.com/BfqqSRN.png](https://i.imgur.com/BfqqSRN.png)\n\nI will be working with Zack on the storyboard, taking heavy inspiration from the Nouns creative content funded and created before us. Like I said above, this documentary will be as Nounish as possible - joyful, creative, inspirational yet it doesn‚Äôt take itself too seriously.\n\nIn addition, we will Nounify the entire documentary by procuring a Nounish custom wheelchair, Nounish marketing materials for the mega ramp, a large inflatable pair of Noggles to have on set of the triple back flip, and some Nounish goods already created and funded via NounsDAO. \n\n![https://i.imgur.com/mR5OivM.png](https://i.imgur.com/mR5OivM.png)\n\nWhen we finish the short doc, we will premiere it on Youtube and Twitter and then send a droposal to the DAO to release it as an open edition where 50% of the proceeds will go back to NounsDAO and the other 50% will go to Life Rolls On - a non-profit organization picked by Wheelz that is dedicated to improving the quality of life for young people affected by spinal cord injury and utilizes action sports as a platform for inspiring the infinite possibilities beyond paralysis. \n\nWe will also launch [everydayforever.wtf](http://everydayforever.wtf) as a CC0 repository for select footage we take during this process. We want to encourage collaboration and inspire creators to experiment with all of this Nounish content we‚Äôre creating. As part of the proposal, we will also be managing, maintaining and expanding on the collection of Nouns CC0 material on everydayforever.wtf for a year.\n\n**Timeline**\n\nOur aim is to have everything delivered within 6 months at the latest. \n\n**The Future**\n\nWhat a great thing to think about. I hope to tell more awesome stories about Nounish folks in my life and bring them into the ever-growing Nouns Universe. Leveling up with each proposal, making you all smile and having fun is the goal.\n\nWith [everydayforever.wtf](http://everydayforever.wtf) I want to collect and aggregate as much Nounish CC0 material in one place so that anyone from anywhere can build on top of the magic we‚Äôre building here. \n\n**Team**\n\n**Dwight Torculas (Noun 64)** - Previously, I was the cofounder & CEO of the music NFT company Mint Songs which was recently acquired by Napster.

      "content": "# Nouns Wallet Service\n\n![Group 16.png](https://i.postimg.cc/pTxFF6Q9/Group-16.png)\n\n***************special thanks to the Lil Nouns for the help in shaping this proposal and for putting it onchain***************\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nA new Nouns service to place NFTs in Apple & Google Wallets, unlocking the ability for communities to send push notifications to token holders and for simple event token gating\n\n- A new communication layer for token-based communities.\n- Tooling that makes web3 more understandable to the mainstream.\n- A free tool, available to every web3 community ‚Äî where every new community that uses the tool proliferates the noggles and their association with building exceptional public infrastructure.\n\n**About us**\n\nWe‚Äôre good at making stuff go mainstream & viral ‚Äì like our website [Poolsuite.net](http://poolsuite.net), our music app¬†[Poolsuite FM](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/poolsuite-fm/id1514817810), our sunscreen co¬†[Vacation¬Æ](https://twitter.com/marty/status/1616852882480840709?s=20), and our¬†[Palm Report](https://www.palm.report/)¬†newsletter which is read by over 70,000 people every week. At Poolsuite, we‚Äôre a small team of passionate builders with a desire to create beautiful internet products, and we‚Äôre keen to understand the appetite within the Nouns community to collaborate. While we don‚Äôt yet have a treasury that enables us to focus our primary efforts on public goods, we can bring our deep understanding of consumer products and expertise in crafting rich brand worlds to the Nouns ecosystem. In the same way we have begun collaborating with major designer brands (alpha soon) we want to do the same within web3, and we see Nouns as one the most actively engaged and innovative communities in the space, uniquely positioned for us to work with on wonderfully designed products that push forward web3 adoption alongside the combined awareness of our brands.\n\n**INTRODUCING NOUNS WALLET SERVICE**\n\n---\n\nNouns Wallet Service would allow any user to add **any NFT** (or ERC-20) into their Apple/Android wallet ‚Äî the same place they keep their loyalty cards, boarding passes, and credit cards ‚Äî unlocking the ability for web3 communities to send push notifications to token holders and a wealth of powerful future use cases. This tool would be usable by any Ethereum based DAO/NFT collection. \n\n![Screenshot 2023-01-09 at 10.20.37 PM.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XJ8yckxs/Screenshot-2023-01-09-at-10-20-37-PM.png)\n\n**Why?**\n\n- In the mainstream view, NFTs are still mostly seen as investment assets but placing NFTs side by side with loyalty cards and boarding passes tangibly demonstrates that they offer much more and can unlock a variety of experiences. To bring the next wave of mainstream users to web3, we need tools that make the web3 experience as friendly as web2.\n- There's an engagement problem in web3; its incredibly hard to communicate with token holders. We've seen this first hand fighting our way to the top of the Twitter feed to notify our [Executive Members](https://members.poolsuite.net/) of new drops. A lot of communities are building their own apps to try to solve this engagement challenge but not every project needs an app.\n- The shutdown of the Nouns Discord opened the door for reimagining what the communication and social layers can look like for decentralized communities. Nouns communications are currently fragmented. And while there are various [chat groups](https://nouns.center/groups), [newsletters](https://nouns.substack.com/), and Twitter accounts, there is no simple real-time communication layer that is gaining significant traction.\n\n****************************Considerations****************************\n\n- Nouns Wallet Service would be a free tool, available to every web3 community.\n- Every new community that uses the tool would proliferate the noggles and their association with building public web3 infrastructure. Nouns Wallet Service would launch as ‚ÄúNouns Wallet Service public infrastructure by Nouns DAO‚Äù, similar to [Prop House](https://prop.house/), [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build/), [Voters.wtf](https://www.voters.wtf/nouns).\n- Unlike with mobile apps, push notifications are enabled by default with wallet passes, meaning no additional opt-in is required.\n- Last year we built an early version of Wallet Service for our Executive Members that generated a ton of excitement within our community, and we‚Äôre confident we can develop this into a fully-packaged service that works incredibly well for both centralized and decentralized communities.\n- We‚Äôve passed Lil Nouns prop lot with 687 upvotes (9% consensus) ‚Äì s/o Lil Nouns community for feedback, helping us shape up this proposal, and for putting this proposal onchain.\n\n**Funding Request**\n\nWe‚Äôre asking for 120 ETH to design and build Nouns Wallet Service including 1 year of maintenance from our team. To bring the next wave of mainstream users to web3, we need tools that make the web3 experience as friendly as web2 ‚Äì and we believe these tools should be built as public infrastructure, freely available for all DAOs. The funding would go towards:\n\n- **Web App**¬†‚Äì Designing & building a beautiful interactive web app where users will be able to connect wallet and select which NFTs to add to their mobile wallet (on desktop: scan QR, on mobile: download natively). We‚Äôll design this interface alongside the Nouns community to reach an exceptional execution of the Nouns brand.\n- **Token Integration**¬†‚Äì Building upon our rudimentary alpha version to integrate with any Ethereum token based community (ERC-721, 1155, and 20)\n- **Custom Push Notifications**¬†‚Äì Creating a customizable push notification system where Nouners (and other Nounish DAO members) will be able to choose frequency (live, daily, weekly) and type of notifications from a selection of onchain events (new proposal submitted, funded, voting open, capital deployed, prop house voting open, etc.).\n- **Admin Panel**¬†‚Äì Creating an admin panel for teams to manage & send custom push notifications & update the text & links on the back of the passes.\n- **Pass Designs**¬†‚Äì Automating the design process of wallet passes based on any NFT visual assets. For Nouns and lil Nouns we‚Äôll design custom passes which we‚Äôll share with the community for approval. For other communities, we‚Äôll automatically assign a color scheme based on the NFT imagery (unique for each NFT).\n\n********************************Potential future use cases********************************\n\n- Token gating IRL with a QR scanner: Wallet Service would allow for a very simple 1 NFT = 1 Event Ticket gating system.\n- Integrating new sources of notifications for Nouns/Nounish DAOs such as Prop House events, votes from key delegates (Nouncil voted ‚ÄúFor‚Äù Proposal 367), 3rd party sources to select from (ex. Discord), etc.\n- Ability to customize pass fields to include points/token balance(s), contributor status, awards, and to allow users to add their name to the card or select their own colors.",

      "content": "# Nouns Deli Melbourne: Piloting a Nounish Franchise Model\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/brMYBcjg/e1f442e0ca.gif)\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/m2zgFDQ5/Exterior-Final-2.jpg)\n\n\n\nTLDR\n=====\n\nWe are proposing $202k funding for the first permanent Nouns IRL food service store. The plan is to rebrand a venue currently owned by 87Bones ([Noun 552](https://nouns.wtf/noun/552)) in Melbourne, Australia, turning it ‚ÄòNounish‚Äô. With this we will create an open franchisable package with the intention of scale. The team is already highly respected in the industry with experience across the breadth of the field. As the venue is already a profitable business, we believe this would be a low-risk opportunity for Nouns to enter the IRL space. After initial funding this site will be totally self-sustainable.\n\nThe shop redesign will be largely cosmetic.  A benefit of recreating an already established venue is that most of the infrastructure and industrial equipment has already been purchased.\n\nInstead, the funding will be spent on ‚ÄòNounifying‚Äô the deli and adding custom fixtures to proliferate the brand. The new design will feature screens displaying the nouns daily auctions amongst other Nounish content. We will install large display shelves allowing the sale of a custom merch and a consumable range. Alongside the Nouns deli branded merch and consumable, this space could be an additional platform for previous and future successful Nouns proposals to sell their products on consignment.\n\nOur goal is to build the Nouns Deli brand into a scalable business, opening up opportunities to expand around the world. Sticking to the Nouns CC0 philosophy, our vision is to build a fee-less franchise model; we intend to make everything open source, available to all. As this is rare in the hospitality industry, we expect it to gain a lot of attention, and with it the potential for even more brand proliferation. [Goldy](https://twitter.com/Goldypix) (Nounish, Goat Club) & Jarmen ([Noun 332](https://nouns.wtf/noun/332)) will be jumping on the team in Noun advisory roles to focus on public relations/education & content.\n\nThe Deli / The Team **‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n----------------------------\n\nStan‚Äôs Deli is a local community hotspot, positioned off one of Melbourne‚Äôs most popular boutique shopping strips comprising over 400 retail shops. The area is central to some of Melbourne‚Äôs most affluent suburbs. Stan‚Äôs is known for its coffee and sandwiches, consistently being voted in the top 5 sandwich venues in Melbourne. The deli has been operating as a profitable business for 3 years with a further 3x3x3 left on the lease. The owners are three experts in the hospitality and retail industry, who between them operate 10 retail spaces, 3 beverage brands and over 40 years combined experience in the industry.\n\nThis teams owns some of Melbourne‚Äôs most iconic venues and have a strong track record: Chef hats (Australia‚Äôs Michelin Star), ongoing listings in critics top foodie destinations, best fitout awards and a non-alcoholic beverage brand selling over 1.2 million serves across 8 countries and a VC funding deal of AUD $13m.  \nThe team‚Äôs expertise spreads across all aspects of the business, from food and beverage development, day to day business logistics to brand creation and marketing. Between them, they know the ins and outs of creating a successful business.\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/5/5624277e125605b77f0d060c6e66d8bf9224abd1.gif)\n\n[See full video here](http://stansdeli.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-REVIEWS-2.mp4)\n\n**Flipping it Nounish ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n----------------------------\n\nTo make the venue truly Nounish, Stan‚Äôs Deli will need a full cosmetic facelift. The essential commercial equipment will remain, but significant changes to the design of the deli are needed to highlight the Noun brand. Our goal is to create a timeless sandwich shop model, incorporating the Nounish pixel art-focused design that can easily be replicated in different locations worldwide. Along with this timeless and replicable design, we want to incorporate custom neon Noggles and exterior murals designed by local artists to make each franchise unique to its location.\n\nDriving home the Nouns brand, we want to add a modern twist, installing screens to display the Nouns daily auctions & other Nounish content on rotation. While customers grab a bite, they can engage and learn more about the DAO.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/6QwWSfFk/stansdeliinside-1.jpgg)\n\n**CC0 ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n------------\n\nWith a CC0 culture, the new Nouns Deli will change the narrative in the hospitality industry. Currently, it all happens behind closed doors; the secret herbs and spices, special burger sauces. Heck, coke has its recipe in a bank vault that only two people can access at a time. We want to spread the Nouns CC0 philosophy and make everything open source through our CC0 library; recipes, package designs and branding assets will all be made available on our website. The wave of interest and attention the CC0 model will create in this industry will give us the perfect platform to share these core Nouns values.\n\n**The Model ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n------------------\n\nThe team is proposing a franchisable model for scaling when ready. Adhering to the Nouns philosophy, there will be no fee associated with this franchise model. To ensure the brand is held to a high standard, those wishing to be officially affiliated with Nouns Deli will have to undertake a compulsory screening process. Once the original Nouns Deli is established, our team will provide consulting and mentoring services to approved franchisees. The goal is for scalability, the ability to replicate across the world.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/Xv8j0ybp/a28d36944e9a917b2c2d81a5e45d81b0.jpg)\n\n**The App ‚åê‚óß-‚óß -**\n------------------\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/hjZKXWhn/NOUN-LOYALTY-APP.jpg)\n\nA custom app will be developed as an easily accessible platform for the Noun‚Äôs Deli community and will extend to include any additional franchises. The app will reward regular customers through a loyalty program model, allowing them to earn points towards benefits or discounts with each purchase; a modern day coffee loyalty card. Customers will stay engaged through the use of push notifications, delivering exclusive offers such as happy hours discounts and CTA rewards. These push notifications can also be an opportunity to circulate engaging creative content and Nounish news. The CC0 library will also be made available on the app, alongside cooking videos and other educational tools. Our mobile app will encourage return clientele, creating an experience that extends the reach beyond the physical brick and mortar offerings, drawing them back to further engage with Nouns.\n\n**Proliferation/touch points ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe potential for proliferation with a franchise model grows with every expansion. The team has a presence in the local hospitality industry and strong existing relationships with three core media agencies in Melbourne‚ÄîBroadsheet, UrbanList, and Concrete Playground‚Äîwhich have a combined reach of 6.4 million. The team will use these connections to gain feature articles and free marketing. Our paid marketing strategies will focus on two areas: online viability using large platforms such as Twitter to reach current untapped audiences, and physical presence focusing on capturing the already large NFT culture within Melbourne. This would include poster runs, pop-up NFT events, and catering to NFT/Web3 conferences. To ensure the Nounish culture of giving is also proliferated, we hope to give out free Nouns ‚ÄòDeli Burgers‚Äô wrapped in noggles paper to underprivileged communities. We want to highlight the incredible impact this DAO has had and will continue to have, essentially sharing the story.\n\nOur vision for the first permanent Nouns IRL store is bigger than just a sandwich shop with Noggles painted on; we want to create an approachable educational tool for the DAO. QR codes on coffee cups, enabling us to direct daily traffic selected content, such as the ‚ÄòThis is Nouns‚Äô video highlighting content from other successful props. Currently averaging around 100,000 coffee sales each year, this is just one easily executed proliferation tool.\n\nAs we are entering uncharted territory for the DAO we believe transparency with data collection from these marketing tools and activations is useful information for the community and future proposers. All analytics gathered will be made available on our website.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/C15gTP7Q/ezgif-5-e168849c16.gif)\n\nThe Sauce ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n==============\n\nAn avenue we believe has huge potential is a ‚ÄúNouns Deli Sauce‚Äù range. We want to create a packaged consumable range that will be featured throughout our in-store menu. Launching the range will be the ‚ÄúNouns Hot Sauce‚Äù. Our dear friend, Mathew Garthweight, owner of [Mats Hot Shop](https://matshotshop.com/en-us)‚ÄîAustralia‚Äôs leading boutique hot sauce distributor‚Äîwill collaborate with Nouns Deli to produce our very own ‚ÄúNouns Hot Sauce‚Äù. The products will be available to ship worldwide, allowing consumers to recreate Nouns Deli sandwiches at home. Matt has previously created his own range of hot sauces with huge success, winning multiple international competitions. Upon release, one hot sauce will be made claimable for each Noun holder. Other sauces we intend to roll out into the range are ‚ÄúNouns Burger Sauce‚Äù and ‚ÄúNouns Dipping Ranch‚Äù, but the possibilities are endless and can be rolled out according to consumer demand.\n\nBuilding out our new menu, we plan to feature a ‚ÄòDeli Burger‚Äô as a nod to Noun 552 owned by 87Bones. This burger will be served in branded sleeves, and is sure to be one of the most recognizable items on the menu. Furthermore, the Deli Burger will be the item served at all of our pop-up events. Additionally, we will invite guest chefs to collaborate and create menu items inspired by other Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/hhWWmSBk/ezgif-3-71fedd840b.gif)\n\n**Retail/Merch ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n---------------------\n\nStan‚Äôs Deli has been highly successful with its merchandise in the past, so we intend to release some branded Nouns Deli merchandise. The first drop will feature Nouns Deli t-shirts, hoodies, coffee mugs, a tote bag, and our consumable range.\n\nFurthermore, we would like to use our space to create a platform for previous and future successful Nouns proposals to sell their products on consignment, thus providing another platform for the success of Nouns products.\n\n**ROI ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n------------\n\nThis is not merely a ‚Äúflash-in-the-pan‚Äù proposition; instead, the intention is to promote long-term proliferation of Nouns. The store will serve as a ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù educational billboard for the DAO, enabling it to capture public attention and provide information and content through multiple touchpoints. This will create a scalable IP for public benefit. Moreover, the store will be an opportunity to grow the community, share resources and knowledge regarding the DAO. Having already established itself as a popular foodie destination, and with a team committed to providing great hospitality supplemented with education, Nouns Deli is set to be a success.\n\n**The Risk ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n-----------------\n\nWhy would we close a profitable business? \"As a recently minted Noun holder, I‚Äôm committed to the Nouns brand and believe it can become widely recognised in the near future. The Nouns model aligns with my morals and values and I want to use my resources and skill set to proliferate this incredible brand.‚Äù - 87Bones.\n\n**Additional Factors ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n---------------------------\n\nThe rebranding fit-out will cause some time of closure and loss of revenue, we predict around 2 months until Nouns Deli can open its doors to the public. Having built a strong team over the past three years, we would like to hold on to the core members through this time. We intend to utilise this time to educate our team on all things Nouns, by reopening, our team will be able to guide our guests through the nouns ecosystem with ease.\n\nOther costs that will continue during the closure are rent, insurance, utilities and other creditors.\n\nThe Budget ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n---------------\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/9Q2z527g/NOUNS-BUDGET.jpg)\n\nPayment Schedule ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n---------------------\n\nWe are proposing a three-milestone payment schedule for funds from the multi-sig. The first payment will be used to commence the designs for the Deli, develop the website and app, and obtain the necessary permits for the site. The second payment will be made on the date of Stan‚Äôs Deli‚Äôs closure and allocated towards the shop fit-out. The third and final payment will be made on the day of Nouns Deli‚Äôs opening and designated towards the marketing and PR budget.\n\n1.  $83,043\n    \n2.  $104,518\n    \n3.  $15,200\n    \n\nMultisig Wallet Signers (3/5): eth: [0xa5E73b7B1a2422edb1824A1BDfDb8dD9E2c22Be8](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa5E73b7B1a2422edb1824A1BDfDb8dD9E2c22Be8)\n\n87Bones, Jarmen, Maty, Digital Oil, Goldy",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 252 - Nouns Fine Jewellery by: State Property ‚Äì supported by HeyMint",
      "content": "# Nouns Fine Jewellery by: State Property ‚Äì supported by HeyMint\n\n**tl;dr**: Asking for USDC188,150 to bridge Nouns into the luxury fine jewellery scene with State Property; to create contemporary 1/1 Nouns-themed pieces sold via auction, with 100% proceeds going back to the Nouns treasury.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0sOrNun.png)\n**Description:**\nState Property and Nouns presents **NFJ, an exclusive collection of Nounish fine jewellery**.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the visual aesthetics of Nouns, the jewellery designs embody elements of meme culture and Nounish culture. Staying true to the Nouns style, the drop will be released via a daily auction, with 100% proceeds from the auctions going back to the NounsDAO treasury.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QnTnl7I.png)\nNFJ lies at the intersection of Nouns, non-fungible tokens (NFT), and fine jewellery. Using NFT to deliver this physical collection, it represents our shared enthusiasm towards this phenomenon where culture and technology converge.\n\nThe NFJ project is a strategic collaboration between three brands:\n1. **Nouns**, with its extensive network and NFT presence\n2. **State Property**, a fine jewellery label known for their contemporary designs, whose distribution network spreads globally, and the choice of many reknown celebrities\n4. **HeyMint**, smart contract and technical experts who have centered their mission around making Web3 accessible to everyone\n\nThrough this collaboration, we hope to achieve the following:\n- Proliferate the brands of all three partners\n- Introduce Nouns and fine jewellery to NFT collectors; introduce blockchain technology and NFTs to traditional fine jewellery audience\n- Develop an exclusive line of fine jewellery that is worth collecting, and for full auction proceeds to go back to the Nouns treasury\n- Create sustainable utility, where Nouns holders can tap onto HeyMint's Smart Contract Launchpad to launch their own NFT collections \n\n---\n# Fine Jewellery, NFT, and Nouns\nFine jewellery is a specific class of jewellery that uses precious metals and gemstones, and is known for their exquisite craftsmanship. Because of their exceptional quality and high value, fine jewellery pieces are often passed down as family heirloom.\n\nThe emergence of NFTs has opened up many possibilities. With Nouns, a self-governing organisation that begets organic brand building has emerged. With fine jewellery, NFT presents a means to collect and authenticate fine jewellery with ease.\n\nNFJ celebrates Nouns by incorporating Nounish elements everywhere. Designing around Nounish elements instead of a specific Noun gives the jewellery pieces broad appeal, and when collectors discover their backstory, it becomes extra meaningful. Our goal is to start with an exclusive first collection, with potential for wider releases as awareness and demand grow.\n\n---\n# **The NFJ Project**\n\n**The NFJ Project comprises of a few key deliverables:**\n1. Design and crafting of the 1/1 physical jewellery pieces\n2. NFJ exhibition\n3. Media event and online proliferation\n4. Daily timed-auctions\n5. Redemption for physical jewellery with NFT\n6. Post-event activations\n\n**1: Design And Crafting**\nThe NFJ collection embodies the vibrancy of the Noun characters. Taking cue from iconic Noun traits, the collection is an artistic expression of meme culture and Nouns culture while retaining the quintessential luxe of fine jewellery.\n\nAll our physical jewellery will be made in 18-Karat gold and will contain gemstones ranging from white diamonds, coloured diamonds, sapphires, rubies, and tsavorites. Specific specifications as shown below: \n![](https://i.imgur.com/zqkYDBl.jpg)\n\nThere are a total of nine designs, each of which are bespoke and one-of-a-kind. This is similar to the concept of 1/1 NFTs where there is only ever one of that piece and its provenance is cemented on the blockchain.\n\nThe technical drawings above showcase State Property's creative vision and their artistry in adopting Nounish aesthetics. In giving this luxury spin to Nouns, State Property has designed for these pieces to appeal to the luxury fine jewellery audience that they are very familiar with, and are aware of clients who will be eager to get their hands on them. \n\nUpon passing of the proposal and successive funding, the designs will be turned into 3D, moulded, and then crafted. Thereafter, we'll do a photoshoot of the physical pieces. \n\n**2: Jewellery Exhibition**\nThe launch of NFJ kicks off with a fortnight-long exhibition for these nine jewellery pieces, hosted at State Property's Atelier. There will be daily online features during the campaign period on [NounsinSG Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg) and  State Property's [socials](https://instagram.com/thisisstateproperty), sharing the backstory and inspiration behind the collection and the designs. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/97Aw6WO.jpg)\n*Outside view of State Property Atelier's main showroom ‚Äì decorated with Noggles.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eITF36S.jpg)\n*Display showcase updated in Noggles and the collection theme.*\n\nLocated in the civic district of Singapore, the State Property showroom at [Armenian Street](https://www.nac.gov.sg/resources/engagements-with-the-sector/45-armenian-street) is the perfect venue for the exhibition and event. The area has been designated as an arts space and often draws in huge crowds during seasonal events. Utilising State Property's space is strategic and would also lower the ask of the proposal.\n\nBased on our expected timeline, we plan for the exhibition to coincide with [Token2049](https://www.asia.token2049.com/) (13‚Äì14 September 2023) and [F1 Singapore](https://www.gpmotorsportstickets.com/formula-1/singapore-grand-prix-tickets/) (15‚Äì17 September 2023). While Token2049 attracts a Web3 audience, F1 draws in tourists from around the world. \n\nState Property's central location and proximity to these events makes it really easy for interested visitors to hop over to check out the exhibition during the week. Our goal is to maximise attendance and reach of the exhibition, which will grow the attention and demand for the auction. Thereafter, the media event will happen the week after the F1 weekend so as to deconflict from the packed schedule of international visitors.\n\n**3: Media Event And Online Proliferation**\nThe key highlight of the exhibition will be the media night. This will be held on the second week of the exhibition.\n\n> **Expected Event Dates**\nExhibition: 11 Sep, Monday ‚Äì 24 Sep, Sunday\nMedia Night: 22 Sep, Friday\nDaily Auctions: 25 Sep, Monday ‚Äì 3 Oct, Tuesday\n\nWe'll be inviting the local media and influencers to cover the event. The NFJ collection will also be featured in [Tatler Asia](https://www.tatlerasia.com/) magazine *(Luxury media brand in Asia with over 3M monthly online visitors)*, and will be covered by jewellery reviewer, [Katerina Perez](https://katerinaperez.com/) (*Jewellery insider with over 13 years experience and over 400K Followers on Instagram*).\n\nWe will also extend invitations to various NFT communities as well as State Property's clientele. And on the event day, we will have a Nouns booth by @NounsinSG to share more about Nouns, and also a [NFT Workshop](https://www.wereearly.xyz/resources/intro-to-nft) hosted by @Han (Beetle) to introduce NFTs to the non-Web3 fine jewellery audience.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bb09JvH.png)\n\n**4. Daily Timed-Auctions**\nAt the end of the exhibition and event, we will kickstart the online auction for the 1/1 Jewellery NFTs in Nouns-style i.e. one NFT per day. Each time an auction is settled, the settlement transaction will also cause the next NFT to be released and a new 24H auction to begin. **Full proceeds from the auctions will go to the Nouns treasury.**\n\nWinners of the auction will be able to receive the corresponding 1/1 Jewellery. This is done through a redemption process on the website, and they will receive the physical jewellery at no additional cost.\n\n**5.Redemption For Physical Jewellery With NFT**\nWhen all the daily auctions conclude, the website will be updated with a Redemption Page. Jewellery NFT owners will be able to redeem for the physical jewellery. \n\nThe redemption process requires NFT owners to enter their personal particulars and delivery details, and a confirmation email will be sent before the delivery is dispatched. During the process, NFT owners need to allow the website to read the wallet for the NFT and sign an on-chain transaction to update the NFT. \n\nOnce redeemed, the NFT will be updated with a 'Redeemed' status. Buyers and owners of a 'Redeemed' NFT will not be able to redeem for the physical jewellery. Redemption of the physical jewellery is optional. \n\n**6.Post-Event Activations**\nNFJ is more than a one-time activation. We want to ensure continuity with whatever we've been funded to build, which includes releasing a second collection and giving access to a NFT launchpad.\n\n**I: The Noggle Collection**\nYou might notice that none of the designs in the first collection incorporated the Noggle. This was intentional so that the designs can have broad appeal while being Nounish. As fine jewellery is often an article that initiates conversation, we also want people to ask, \"What about the Noggles?\"\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RuOIK35.png)\n\nThis brings us to the second collection, which will be released as demand scales up. These will be customisable and also redeemable for their physical counterparts. \n\n**II: Build With HeyMint**\n[HeyMint](https://heymint.xyz) has developed two tools ‚Äì an allowlist manager, and a no-code NFT creator tool, HeyMint. While the basic smart contract launchpad is free to use, premium features like Staking, Burning, Soulbinding, Refunds, and Snapshots, are token-gated to partnered communities. With the NFJ collaboration, HeyMint will grant Nouns holders premium access, which means that builders within the Nouns ecosystem will get permanent access to these creator tools.\n\n---\n\n# **Who We Are**\n[**State Property**](https://thisisstateproperty.com)\nEstablished since 2015, State Property is a fine jewellery label whose minimalistic and modern designs have been worn by Michelle Obama, Nicole Kidman, Taylor Swift, and many other celebrities. Their jewellery have also been featured in magazines including Vogue, Tatler, Cosmopolitan, and WWD. Based in Singapore, their distribution network stretches across the Middle East, EU, UK, and US (including [Net-A-Porter](https://www.net-a-porter.com/en-us/shop/designer/state-property)).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DROOkEg.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KqyfR5Z.jpg)\n\nState Property's collections are often inspired by nature, architecture, and even the stars, and they have a knack to imbue storytelling into their designs. For example, they have a collection (*[Voyager](https://thisisstateproperty.com/collections/the-voyager)*) with pieces named after famous adventurers, while another collection (*[Unfold](https://thisisstateproperty.com/collections/unfold)*) reimagines the classic pearl in contemporary settings. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jkxtzOX.png)\n\nState Property's clientele are typically working professionals or high net worth individuals who can afford to spend on fine jewellery. They are attracted to State Property's unique and contemporary designs that can be worn casually or for more formal occasions.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SMvpaAk.jpg)\nEdgy designs, celebrity fanfare, and established distribution aside, State Property is uniquely positioned to step into the NFT scene. With their design-centric background and artistic interest, founders Ruiyin and Afzal recognises the advent of NFT as another platform for creative expression, just like jewellery. Their readiness to experiment and embrace new innovations also positions them to onboard the largely traditional industry and non-Web3 collectors into the space. \n\n**[HeyMint](https://heymint.xyz)**\nA team of creatives and developers who aims to build the best free tools available so as to help make Web3 mainstream. HeyMint are experienced technical builders and has helped major brands in the NFT space with their drops, including Zen Academy, World Of Women Galaxy, Kingship, and The Littles. Founders Mai Akiyoshi and Ben Yu are software engineers at heart and have grown their passion into a technical team who build tools for the Web3 economy.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PapVaWA.png)\n\nWith NFJ, HeyMint are the right fit as technical partners as they envision a similar future shaped by Web3 builders. NFJ is just the start that adds a single Auction function onto their Launchpad. Opening up their Launchpad to the many builders within the Nouns ecosystem also puts them in the best position to tap onto these creative minds, while they focus on being the technical experts. The potential projects that will come out of this collaboration is endless and will certainly contribute to the exponential growth and adoption of Web3 and NFTs.\n\n**Han [(Beetle)](https://twitter.com/beetleswt)**\nThe one who ties it all together. Han is an active community lead in CloneX Singapore; he regularly coordinates local meet-ups and collaborates with other global CloneX community leads to spearhead initiatives for the community.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SalAzSa.jpg)\nHan believes that the future of brand building is NFTs and brands will build in a ground-up manner alongside their communities. He runs regular NFT workshops for small groups and for corporates to introduce them to the concept of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. The workshops include a hands-on NFT minting session that uses Nouns Playground to create the visuals and leads to a discussion on DAOs. *See [presentation materials](https://www.wereearly.xyz/resources/intro-to-nft).* \n\nOver the past three years, Han has worked closely with State Property with their digital marketing efforts. He was also one of the early evangelists with the HeyMint team. In bringing together all the contributing partners, Han will also be the main project lead coordinating\n\n\n---\n\nTHIS PROP IS LONGER THAN THE MAX LENGTH FOR SNAPSHOT:\n\n Read the rest of the prop at https://nouns.wtf/vote/252",

      "content": "# Showcase Nouns 3D-Printed Fashion Collection at NFT.NYC\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/onFwPa6.jpg)\n\nAfter a very successful debut at NFT Paris, I want to expose more people to my  Nouns-inspired 3D printed fashion collection of 5 looks at NFT.NYC on April 12-14.\n\nSince the collection currently has momentum and is \"hot\", I strongly believe the DAO should double down on showcasing it at relevant events and getting more IRL eyeballs on it.\n\n**Summary:**\n* **Exhibition Space:** the Fashion area of the event in NYC‚Äôs Javits Center\n* **Expected Attendance:** 8,000 -10,000\n* **Total Costs:** $51,720 \n\t* **Exhibition Space Rental:** $10,000 (goes to nft.nyc)\n\t* **Exhibition Space A/V, Furniture & Logistics:**  $22,220\n\t* **Video Animation**: $1,500\n\t* **Travel:** $6,000 (2 People)\n\t* **My Comp:** $12,000\n\n**Why NFT.NYC?**\n* NFT.NYC is one of the world‚Äôs most prominent NFT events. Last year's Nouns presence in the city during the events was very valuable.\n* The collection is striking and attracts a lot of attention. It‚Äôs a fantastic way to present the Nouns and expose more people to the brand.\n* During my conversations at NFT Paris, I realized how many people have never heard of Nouns. Using the collection & its funding story as a Nouns marketing tool is very powerful.\n\n**Details of what we will get at NFT.NYC**\n\n* 100 Square Foot Exhibition Booth at the fashion corner, April 12-14\n* Event Branding - NFT Swag Bag inclusion, Logo on AV materials\n* Ticket Package - 2 GA Tickets, 2 Expo Staff Passes\n* Working with Reaction AV LED Wall - 11\" X 8\"\n* Working with T3 to bring 5 Mannequin and pedestal \n* AR instagram filter for each look\n\n**Expected Outcome**\n\n* Exposing Nouns to 8,000-10,000 NFT-curious American audience (most of the NFT Paris audience was European)\n* Creating additional opportunities thanks to the serendepity of a massive event\n    * e.g. In Paris, I met the host of Miami NFT Week who will wear one of the looks on stage while hosting the event\n* We may get more press thanks to the collection and my physical presence at NFT.NYC.\n\n\n**Recap of NFT Paris:**\n* 18,000 people attended, and saw the collection and its interactive exhibition area which was right smack in the center of the event\n* The exhibition featured five looks dressed on mannequins.\n* The beautiful [nounsvision](https://nounsvision.com/) glasses complemented the garments, and many people were happy to try them on IRL and take pictures with them\n* There were [AR instagram filters](https://imgur.com/a/RKIZlBR) for each garment, which got 5.6K exposures on Instagram\n* [Four holograms](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpUUpw4MJsy/) showcased the collection‚Äôs virtual runway show \n* A huge screen looped a [video of the collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHauDW5BQQY) made by the nounish ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®  team. \n* I gave a 20 minute talk about Nouns DAO and the making of the collection. \n\n**Press Outreach & Successful Hits:**\n\nI worked with [@nounish](https://www.nounish.world/) to build a [Press Kit](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jpsoejrbg6pcsm3/AAC_cdsZJLKWZYbRQSEJRLYUa?dl=0) and [Press Release](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jpsoejrbg6pcsm3/AAC_cdsZJLKWZYbRQSEJRLYUa?dl=0&preview=000+Press+Release+Nouns+DAO+x+Danit+Peleg.pdf). \n\nThey also did the Press strategy for me and received the following hits:\n* [Vogue Business](https://twitter.com/danitpeleg3d/status/1629106351698837504) and [one more](https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/in-paris-a-new-approach-to-web3)\n* [Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/122445/nouns-3d-printed-fashion-collection-nft-paris)\n* [NFT Now](https://nftnow.com/culture/runway-digital-fashion-from-the-parisian-frontlines/)\n* [NFT Evening](https://nftevening.com/check-out-this-nouns-dao-funded-3d-printed-fashion/)\n* [NFT Plaza](https://nftplazas.com/nouns-fashion-collection/)\n* [Coinspeaker](https://www.coinspeaker.com/nft-3d-printed-collection-nouns/)\n* [Apparel Resources](https://apparelresources.com/business-news/retail/nouns-dao-funds-3d-printed-fashion-collection/)\n* [Cool Hunting](https://coolhunting.com/tech/nft-paris-pairing-the-physical-and-digital/)\n* [3dprinting.com](https://3dprinting.com/news/nouns-dao-funds-am-fashion-collection/)\n\n\n**The Collection:**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/inT1eH0.png)\n\n**Watch a video of the collection:**\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/xXFNoc7.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHauDW5BQQY)\n\n**Paris Crowds:**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FGrpjNW.png)\n\n**The exhibition area in NYC:**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SaxLeKt.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n**A sketch of the exhibition area in NYC:**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SKEwySs.jpg)\n\n**Budget:**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oqfw75L.png)\n\n\nThank you for your consideration <3 \n\nDanit ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® \n\n**Transactions:**\n1. 21,520 USDC to Danit's wallet: 0x81EB3Fd07d84bD3aa0F4Df1359D87820F4cCbEf9\n2. 30,200 USDC to Operations wallet (will be used to pay NFT.NYC & Vendors): 0xFf9e2EF632B432dfF8625CC70836C8c3523Dde54\n\nPS I am also investigating getting the video of the collection with Nouns animation in Times Square during the event.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 250 - Noun Nyms",
      "content": "# Noun Nyms\n\n# Proposal: Noun Nyms\n\n__special thanks to [Noun 40](https://twitter.com/noun40__) for delegating us a noun to make this proposal__\n\n## Background\n\nPersonae Labs is exploring the future of pseudonymity in Ethereum.\n\nWe launched heyanoun.xyz (prop 150) as an early experiment in allowing private truths to surface. \n\nWhile we fundamentally believe that there's value in allowing controversial opinions to surface, we think heyanoun is far from healthy pseudonymity's final form:\n1. it's impossible to engage with a heyanoun opinion pseudonymously\n2. it's hard to filter spam/toxicity from actually useful discourse\n3. users have no way to accrue 'reputation' to their pseudonymous selves\n\nWith this in mind, we're entering our next phase of iteration and we want to launch zk-powered pseudonyms and discussions for nouners. \n\nThis will be the first implementation of our [simple persistent pseudonym](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-simple-persistent-pseudonym-scheme/14930) scheme. \n\nThese both represent relatively ideas in zk-app development and represent a pretty large leap forward from existing capabilities. When we sat down to think about which internet community to pilot them for, the answer was obvious: Nouns.\n\nWe hope that through this work, we'll continue iterating on healthy discussions in the future internet together.\n\n## Primary deliverables\n\nWe'll deliver a hacker news/reddit-style website with two primary features for nouners (verified by ZKP as with heyanoun v1):\n1. persistent pseudonyms\n2. threaded pseudonymous discussions\n\n### threaded discussions\n\nHeyanoun v1 messages can't be replied to or held accountable. While we often see situations in which users broadcast a message effectively replying to a previously posted message, threading isn't explicit.\n\nIn v2, we plan to make it possible to reply to an arbitrary previous message, thus enabling arbitrary discussion trees to form. \n\nWe believe that this is crucial for re-engagement.\n\nWe'll build on the second idea briefly mentioned [here](https://ethresear.ch/t/a-simple-persistent-pseudonym-scheme/14930#extensions-10) to do so. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, we're designing a hacker news/reddit-style interface for creating new discussion points and commenting on old ones.\n\n### persistent pseudonyms\n\nHeyanoun v1 had no sense of persistence in user identity. Users post messages into the ether.\n\nWe believe that with some notion of persistent pseudonyms, we can enable more interesting pseudonymous conversations between nouners. Persistent pseudonyms also allow for simple mechanisms of reputation and content filtering.\n\nIt becomes possible, for example, to filter discussion to just those discussions involving a well-known pseudonym.\n\nAdditionally, nouners will be able to bring their pseudonyms anywhere on the internet; only a specific nouner can generate the proof corresponding to a specific pseudonym. \n\nAlthough we won't be designing for this initially, this portability means that these pseudonyms can be re-used in other internet venues, similar to an ENS name. \n\n### (rough) user flow\n\nWe imagine the following user flow (designs pending):\n- user generates proof of nouner-ship\n- user picks pseudonym to attach to message\n    - any pseudonym they've used before or a new one\n- user picks message in-thread to reply to\n\nIn this way, nouners add pseudonymous messages with pseudonyms attached to one big nounish, pseudonymous discussion tree.\n\n## Secondary deliverables\n\n### downstream consumption by API\n\nAs mentioned above, the resulting 'data artifact' produced is a tree of proofs, pseudonyms, and messages. \n\nWhile today, the main consumption methods for heyanoun messages are twitter/discord bots, we want to open the API such that any nounish downstream site can pull relevant heyanoun messages into their site. \n\n### integration with spartan-ecdsa and further proving improvements\n\nIn parallel with our work on heyanoun, we've been working at [improving our technical capabilities](https://twitter.com/personae_labs/status/1621575568109223936?s=20).\n\nWith heyanoun v2, we'll upgrade our proving stack to the latest and greatest, which will result in considerably faster (<10s in most cases) proving times.\n\n## Timeline and ask\n\nWe come to the DAO presenting an outcome we believe we can drive towards: zk-pseudonyms available to every nouner and a platform for those pseudonyms to have threaded conversation.\n\n**Our ask to the DAO is $160k in helping us reach this outcome.**\n\nAs it's quite a hefty amount of new technology, we expect this to take ~6months for a team of 3-4 devs.\n\nRestated from above, the deliverables:\n- a new hacker news/reddit-style website, built around\n  - pseudonym selection\n  - zk-gated discussion threading\n- APIs for downstream consumption of conversation\n- integration with the best of our proving stack\n\nAs always, our code will be open sourced and made available for extension and re-use.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 249 - Nouns block graffiti x ETH solo staking",
      "content": "# Nouns block graffiti x ETH solo staking\n\n## TL;DR\n\nWe propose to create a 10 ETH monthly prize pool for the next three months where any solo staker that puts ‚Äú‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®‚Äù into their validator‚Äôs [graffiti flag](https://nimbus.guide/graffiti.html) can be permissionlessly eligible to win 1 ETH.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MImNUFD.jpg)\n\n(paintbrush noun snacking after a hard day of nouns graffiti; CC0 art by [brandonmighty](https://foundation.app/@brandonmighty/nounsatwork/6))\n\n---\n\n## Why should Nouns incentivize solo staking?\n\nWe see solo staking as something incredibly nounish. It embodies a desire to contribute to the production and maintenance of a public good (in this case Ethereum‚Äôs decentralization) with the optimistic view that individuals‚Äô independent judgment and actions [can make a difference](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1595793106926014466).\n\nHowever, solo staking, as the name suggests, can be quite lonely. So we wanted to help make it more fun by introducing a distinctly nounish playful & absurdist element: a nouns block graffiti prize pool.\n\n## How can you participate?\n\nIf you already have a staking setup, all you need to do is add ‚Äú‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®‚Äù to the graffiti flag of your consensus client.\n\nIf you aren‚Äôt yet a staker, but always wanted to and this prop is motivating you to stake some of your ETH, then that‚Äôs amazing and we‚Äôll be rooting for you! \n\nThe easiest way to solo stake from home (in our opinion) is [buying an Intel NUC](https://twitter.com/superphiz/status/1546302759439421440) (along with 2TB SSD and 32GB RAM chips) and setting up Dappnode, an open source node operator that helps you install and run Ethereum clients of your choice. You can also buy a ready-to-use staking node from [Dappnode‚Äôs store](https://dappnode.com/en-us/collections/frontpage) which makes it is even easier.\n\n## How will the prizes be paid out?\n\nThe prize ETH will initially be held in a multisig. At the end of each month, starting April, we will initiate a 10 ETH transaction to a smart contract (to be developed) that randomly selects 10 winners amongst a list of candidate validator addresses.\n\nWe‚Äôll use the following options as the validator's address (in this order): A) validator‚Äôs ENS (if included in the block graffiti), B) withdrawal address (if set by the validator), and C) the ‚Äúfrom‚Äù address of the staking deposit transaction. \n\nThe spirit of this proposal is to celebrate and incentivize solo stakers. If we find that a large staking pool is attempting to ruin the fun, we‚Äôll disclose those validators publicly on Twitter and not include them as potential prize candidates.\n\n## How can you follow along?\n\nWe‚Äôll create a site that showcases the ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® graffiti blocks etched into the Ethereum blockchain. We might also create a Twitter bot that tweets out whenever a new block with noggles is discovered.\n\n\n## Who are the volunteers running this program?\n\n[Noun 40](https://twitter.com/noun40__), [gregskril.eth](https://twitter.com/gregskril), and [Ripe](https://twitter.com/ripe0x).\n\n\n## Any additional resources for solo staking?\n\n* [How to stake on Ethereum](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/tvlnck/how_to_stake_on_ethereum_april_2022_edition/) ‚Äî a bit outdated but still the best comprehensive writeup on eth staking by [superphiz](https://twitter.com/superphiz).\n* [Hardware for staking](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/comments/rizos9/hardware_for_staking_2022_edition/) ‚Äî a good run through of the hardware options by [Lamboshi](https://twitter.com/L_Nakaghini).\n* Ethstaker ‚Äî a [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethstaker/) and [discord](http://discord.io/ethstaker) community of eth stakers where you can search for commonly asked questions and get help.\n* [Tweet thread](https://twitter.com/noun40__/status/1627009674603290624) of Noun 40 recently going through the whole process of solo saking from home. \n* [Client Diversity](https://clientdiversity.org/) ‚Äî a site to check Ethereum‚Äôs current client diversity. If you‚Äôre going through all the trouble anyways, why not choose a minority client?\n* [MEV Watch](https://www.mevwatch.info/) ‚Äî a site to check the latest OFAC censorship stats and review non-censoring mev-boost relay options.\n* [The Cost of Resilience](https://writings.flashbots.net/the-cost-of-resilience) ‚Äî research that showcases how setting even a small `min-bid` value of 0.05 ETH can have an outsized impact in supporting Ethereum‚Äôs censorship resistance.

      "content": "# Rage Quit (2)\n\nResubmission since the previous prop would revert due to an incorrect txn bundle (a future prop could add Tenderly txn simulation that would simulate the prop execution). \n\n**Rage Quit Contract**: 0x95852813766e4A3112891FE6a47100023D61e5a4\n\n### Summary\n\n- RQ has been a topic discussed many times but hasn't been actually implemented. With a growing number of disgruntled members of this DAO, rage quit should have been an option a long time ago. Thank you to all members who have delegated their votes to me.\n\n- The primary argument that prevented RQ was that RQ somehow makes Nouns a security and holds the DAO liable for breaking SEC laws. This is quite flawed as the DAO already operates in grey waters in relation to SEC regulations.\n\n- The DAO has already acted as seed investors in proposals and mimics an investment syndicate.\nNouns are essentially class A shares for an entity with a large treasury.\nA large portion of the treasury is in stETH which is an active area of discussion of whether it is a security or not.\n\nIf someone wanted to argue that NounsDAO breaks securities laws, they would have already done so, adding rage quit does not suddenly make Nouns a security.\n\n### Rage Quit Details\nThis implementation is the simplest form of RQ (the contract is only ~100 lines minus comments), we didn‚Äôt want to add any smart contract complications. The flow goes as follows:\n\n1. The treasury will fund the RQ contract in rounds. Round 1 will consist of 25% of the treasury (25% of the ETH and 25% of the stETH). If Round 1 is fully claimed (25% of Nouns have rage quit), another RQ proposal to fund Round 2 will be submitted to fund another 25% (and so on and so on). The reasoning for rounds is that we don‚Äôt want to handicap the DAO by taking custody of all funds while RQ is in process.\n\n2. Round 1 will be active for 2 weeks, during that time, holders that wish to ragequit will transfer their Nouns to the RQ contract and receive their book value of the treasury. The reason we lock Nouns into the contract versus burn Nouns is because only the DAO has the permissions to burn Nouns, thus, the DAO can retrieve all Nouns from the contract at any point.\n\n3. In the case there are funds left in the RQ contract after the deadline (no more people want to rage quit), the DAO can take back all remaining funds.\n\n4. Only Nouns up to Noun #634 (the last noun before this proposal) will be eligible for RQ. This is to prevent new bidders from attempting to arbitrage new Nouns that get auctioned until the prop passes/fails. We are aware that there are Nouns on secondary (currently 12) that may be arbed against the treasury but the way we look at it, these Nouns will be used to get RFV from the treasury regardless. The Nouns selling on secondary below RFV will either be delisted and claimed for RFV or someone will buy the Noun and potentially claim for RFV. Thus, the treasury doesn‚Äôt gain more rage quitters from the Nouns on secondary (at the very best people that buy don't rage quit).\n\n**The current book value for each Nouns is calculated as follows**:\n\nETH book value for 1 Noun is **19 ETH**. This is the treasuries ETH balance **rounded down** with a 5% rage quit fee, the total is also rounded down - floor(13144 eth / 634 * 0.95).\n\nStETH book value for 1 Noun is **22 ETH**. This is the treasuries StETH balance **rounded down** with a 5% rage quit fee, the total is also rounded down - floor(14764 eth / 634 * 0.95).\n\nReview of the contract:\nMost of the variables are immutable constants as to prevent any malicious prop that may siphon more funds out of the treasury. Please ensure these values are correct\n```\n    // final nounID that was auctioned before prop was submitted\n    uint256 public constant FINAL_ELIGIBLE_NOUN = 634;\n\n    // this is the eth treasury balance (rounded down) divided by 634 with a 5% tax\n    // floor(13144 / 634 * 0.95)\n    uint256 public constant ETH_BOOK_VALUE = 19 ether;\n\n    // this is the steth treasury balance (rounded down) divided by 634 with a 5% tax\n    // floor(14764 / 634 * 0.95)\n    uint256 public constant STETH_BOOK_VALUE = 22 ether;\n\n    // proxy address\n    address public constant NOUNS_DAO =\n        0x6f3E6272A167e8AcCb32072d08E0957F9c79223d;\n\n    // nouns treasury address\n    address public constant NOUNS_TREASURY =\n        0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10;\n\n    // nouns token address\n    address public constant NOUNS_TOKEN =\n        0x9C8fF314C9Bc7F6e59A9d9225Fb22946427eDC03;\n\n    // stETH address\n    address public constant STETH = 0xae7ab96520DE3A18E5e111B5EaAb095312D7fE84;\n```\n\n`function extendDeadline(uint256 _claimDeadline) external`: This function can only be called via prop by the DAO. This increases the claim deadline and should be called in the same prop that funds the RQ contract. This effectively sets new ‚Äòrounds‚Äô if previous rounds have been fully claimed.\n\n`function withdrawFunds() external`: This function can only be called via prop by the DAO. This allows the DAO to claim any left over funds from the RQ contract (in the case that there are no more rage quitters and there are funds left in the contract).\n\n`function withdrawNouns(uint256[] memory nounIDs) external`: This function can only be called via prop by the DAO. This allows the DAO to claim all Nouns that are locked in the contract.\n\n`function rageQuitSingleNoun(uint256 nounID) external`: This function locks a single Noun into the contract and returns the Nouns book value to the sender.\n\n`function rageQuitNouns(uint256[] memory nounIDs) external`: This function locks multiple Nouns and returns book value to sender in a single txn.\n\nThe flow will be done via etherscan. It's a similar flow to Opensea where you first `setApprovalForAll()` for the RQ contract and then call `rageQuitSingleNoun()` with your Noun ID. If there is a desire for a frontend, we can whip something up quickly.\n\nFunding\nWe will fund the RQ contract with 3268 ETH and 3674 StETH which will allow up to 172 Nouns to rage quit (~25%).\n\n25% of ETH calculation: floor(13144 * 0.25 / 19) * 19\n25% of StETH calculation: floor(14767 * 0.25 / 22) * 22\n\nTransactions\nSending 3268 ETH and 3674 StETH to RQ contract + setting the deadline to rage quit for round 1 to be April 4 (2 weeks after this proposal passes).",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 246 - Nouns Proposal Tracker",
      "content": "# Nouns Proposal Tracker\n\n## Intro\n\nIn order to operate successfully we need to be able to easily track the status of the proposals Nouns has funded and have a central place to view the end results of completed proposals. \n\nCurrently it is difficult to determine the status of funded proposals. There are 3 statuses a funded proposal might have: completed, in progress, or rugged. As a DAO we should have a clear understanding of the status of all proposals, information related to the progress, and proof of completion which also acts as an easy way for the community to see the end result of a proposal.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe solution for this is the Nouns Proposal Tracker which acts like a wiki for funded proposals.\n\nThis platform tracks funded proposals in real time and allows Noun holders, delegates, and proposal owners to add information about a funded proposal such as the status, progress logs, proof of completion, and comments. \n\nProposals can be sorted by their status to easily give an overview of how many and what types of proposals were completed, or are in progress and how many proposers rugged the DAO.\n\nBy getting a glimpse of potential rugs we can also try to follow-up with the owners of rugged proposals to see if there is a chance to have the work completed. If there is not it's important that these people are held accountable in some way.\n\n## Nouner and Delegate Permissions\n\nNouners and their delegates will be able to modify the status of proposals, add comments/questions, and add proof of completion. Any nouner or delegate can modify the status at any time. \n\n## Proposal Owner Permissions\n\nWallets that submitted proposals have the same permissions as nouners and delegates. They can also add additional wallets which can post on a specific proposal. In addition to the Nouner/delegate permissions proposal owners and their admin wallets can add progress logs. These logs can detail the progress of a given proposal.\n\n## Open-sourced\n\nAll code will be open-sourced for others to fork, build upon, or improve. Repo will have README file the includes instructions on how to run the project locally and contribute to the code base. \n\n## Adding to Nouns Frontend\n\nI can submit a pull request into the Nouns front end repo to add a link to this platform on the DAO page so it can be easily found. We can highlight its uses for those submitting proposals. \n\n## Team \n\nDeployer\n\nOwner of Noun 375 and 609. I am a serial builder and have been building in the NFT space since 2017. I authored ERC2309 which is an ethereum standard allowing for the efficient tracking of a large amount of NFTs across platforms. I built an early NFT platform, called Cargo, which included multi chain minting tools, asset management, a robust JS library, and marketplace that securely processed 10s of millions of dollars worth of transactions.\n\nAs of late I am building the Heroes ecosystem. Heroes started as a CC0 NFT project which stored character stats and traits on chain for people to build upon. The core team is now building a robust web3 powered, free to play game in the spirit of open world building, CC0, and collaboration.\n\nRelated to Nouns I did the frontend and backend development of the Noun O'clock App as part of the Nouns Client prop house.\n\n**Timeline**\n3 months \n\n**Funding ask**\n30 ETH - Development\n3 ETH - 1 year infrastructure costs\n\nTotal 33 ETH",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 245 - Nouns: A Movie",
      "content": "# Nouns: A Movie\n\n# Nouns : A Movie\n*Fund it as we build it. ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®*\n\n### Tl;dr:\nAfter the success of [Prop 195](https://nouns.wtf/vote/195) and the release of the [Nountown animated short film](https://twitter.com/AtriumNft/status/1622726466948694018) we made, we are proposing Nouns engage with Atrium to continually produce a series of episodic content via consecutive proposals. When this content is pieced together retroactively - all of the cinematic content will be able to be binged as a single movie / series. Atrium creatives will write and create the content which will be split up among story acts.\n\nThis specific prop is funding a pilot delivered at the end of 90 days. Detailed below are the steps involved in exploring different visual styles, additional deliverables and ultimately making the Pilot content. \n\nAfter the pilot is revealed in 90 days, the DAO will decide if it wants to move forward in funding more of the whole film.\n\n---\n### Proposal Ask:\n**125,000 USD for a time-period of 90 days**\n\n- Pre-production & character development\n- Script for the Pilot (3.5 mins) / ACT 1 + Summaries of all subsequent acts - delivered at 90 days\n- Animated Teaser with final look for the show - delivered at 45 days \n- Animated Pilot (Runtime 3.5 mins) with the above mentioned script - delivered at 90 days\n\n*transferred to Atrium Multi-sig upon execution*\n\n---\n\nNote: *Subsequent funding pathway for future Acts as detailed below with the rough timeline*. As we go further along the production (optional and will come in different proposals), the timeline gets more efficient and shrinks.\n\n\n\n### Recap: what is Atrium?\nAtrium.art is a crypto-native network of independent artists and creators. Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting, Animation, Concept Art, Voice Actors, and Music production. Together, creatives on Atrium bring experience from Pixar, Marvel, Luma Pictures, Sony, Netflix and many more.\nYou can see the work of Artists on Atrium [here](https://atrium.art/)\nSimply put, Atrium is a way to easily piece together veteran talent to produce cinematic content.\n\n\n### Resident Atrium Team\nMain Creative leads:\n\n[Zendoubt](https://zendoubt.art/) (Creative Director) - Black Panther, Godzilla vs Kong, Thor Ragnarok, Birds of Prey\n![](https://i.imgur.com/opKf6Pr.jpg)\n\n[HKJay](https://hkjay.com/) (Creative Director) - The Sea Beast, Lego Movies, Peter Rabbit, His Dark materials\n![](https://i.imgur.com/F5KrKIg.png)\n\n[3dprintguy](https://atrium.art/artist/3d-print-guy) (Executive Producer)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rmzvlQT.jpg)\n\nWriting Lead :\n[William Yu](https://twitter.com/its_willyu) - BlckList 2021 , Created [#starringjohncho](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-36253081) campaign\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p5x3DE2.png)\n\nExternal Studio Partner (tentative)\nhttps://meta-ent.com/meta/ - Creators of Riri, [Mave: Pandora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wGOHbcQKIc)\n\nIn addition we are assembling a veteran team of creatives (10-14) associating with an external studio partner who will help set up a dedicated production pipeline to handle the needed throughput of the content. This alongside Atrium core will be entirely remote first so it will be the first non-trivial budget content workflow at this scale being funded by nouns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UVaImTv.png)\n\nAdditionally Atrium will be sourcing Voice Over Artists, Sound Design resources for \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9iJ30qE.png)\n\n\n---\n\n### Scope of this proposal (Detailed view)\n*An elaborate pre-production stage is crucial in order to explore the style and feel of a large production before locking / committing to it for the entire duration. These early steps of engagement and experimentation allow us to save time and money by avoiding costly redesigns later.* \n\nDuring Prop 195, While we created a unique and upbeat version of Nountown with character design that were standard, exploring uniqueness with heads and attire; We realised that there was scope to also explore pathways to develop a style framework that introduces : \n- More personality via body types\n- Introduce unique worlds beyond nountown\n\n#### Pre-production\n##### Animation Tests done in public\nThis early stage style exploration allows us to converge on something that will feel coherent and appropriate for the larger production. \n\nAn example of this pre-production work is a screen test done by Sony Animation for a feature length Popeye film: https://youtu.be/M1lzJuwJD9k?t=122\nWhilst this screen test is much more elaborate and polished than we intend, Sony would have done many smaller ones leading up to this very polished result which they were proud to make public.\n\nBy doing an animation screen test we can experiment with different looks in order to find the right one. This can also serve as future reference for other Nouns animated content, as different possible ‚Äúlooks‚Äù.\n\nUnlike Sony Animation, we have the advantage of building in the public eye, giving a rare glimpse into the animation process as well as giving the community a chance to share their sentiment prior to committing to a style..\n\n##### Looks Tests done in public\nThe designs, the texturing and lighting of the world. Does the world feel more clean or is it more grungy like stop motion, E.G. Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio. There are many possibilities to explore. Here are just a few examples.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fXr0zYd.jpg)\n\n#### Deliverable #1 : (45 days mark)\nScreen tests in different looks + a teaser trailer for the Pilot Episode to come at 90 days mark. \n\n#### Story\nThe future of this cinematic story creation begins with a pilot screenplay, but will expand throughout subsequent acts in a way that allows for adults, teens, and kids to find something relatable within the world that is created. \nThe foundations of existing Nounish stories (prop 70, prop 116) will serve as a guide for cultural relevance and overall thematic inspiration for the story but will be unique in its own right. Unlike standard film productions, our build in public stance detailed below will invite the community to experience the magic of production first hand.\n\n#### Building in Public\n- We will be setting up a dedicated corner on the Atrium Server and sharing progress on socials for people to follow-along with the creative process. We plan to release regular media updates and share sneak peeks.\n\n- Anyone inside and outside the Nouns community is welcome to join. Most channels will be open to Public while some production related channels will be private to have agility on creative decisions. \n\n- We will host multiple open town halls with Creatives & the community members to hear ideas and keep the community updated on the process and progress.\n\n- *Casting Calls Galore:* As the Story is being written, we will be introducing an interactive exercise to do casting calls from the nounish community, where we make the picks on the main and auxiliary characters from the submitted / interested community members from nouns DAO and sub DAOs.\n\n- Behind the scenes videos and animation technicals to be produced alongside the content and be distributed after the premiere happens in between the premiere.\n\n#### Deliverable #2 : (90 days mark)\nPilot Episodic premiering on all socials and a Drop Proposal.\n\n#### Ask Summary Recap\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NgL4vbW.png)\n\n----\n### Future Funding Roadmap & Breakdown\n\n*Note: This is optional and only shared as a future roadmap. This is NOT part of this specific proposal scope and will be subjected to their own evaluation parameters.*\n\nIt‚Äôs a first of its kind, large production endeavour which attempts to break-free from legacy content production models and Nouns DAO is at the precipice of being the only few who can enable this. When you look at traditional animated film funding today, they can range from micro budgets (Less than 1M USDC) to Jumbo budgets (200M+), and the bulk is paid for [star actors](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/artist-rights/steve-carell-minions-12-5-million-dollars-219015.html), studio supervisors, and executives. Tangled (with a whopping 260M production cost) was one of the costliest animated features made.\n\nAs we are aware, many times it is normal for incredible artists to drown out and be siloed in suboptimal work culture and long hours in the animation industry, alongside their creative input. Offering budgets that can be competitive while retaining a much higher degree of creative autonomy (in absence of network executives) , we can give them the financial security to leave a traditional studio structure and be part of a long-term vision which seeks to upend the narrative. \n\nAll the team members defined in this proposal already have shown full commitment to come onboard if this series of proposals kicks off and embark on creating one of the highest quality production value the crypto space has seen till date. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5R6YDTS.png)\n\nThis continues till Act 22 and 77 mins total including the pilot (3.5 mins). It runs for 550+ days if funded all the way.\n\n\n### Past Funding from the DAO\n3dprintguy at Atrium was funded for 20 ETH via [Prop 195](https://nouns.wtf/vote/237) and created a standalone animated short film. The same short film is to be released via a Drop proposal ([Prop 237](https://nouns.wtf/vote/237)). All significant characters that are part of the short film were released as collectible NFTs and [usable rigged 3d files](https://twitter.com/passingbags/status/1626410532507906053) were made available for free for anyone to use.\n\n\n### Drop Content Proposals as we go\nDropping Content selectively through the DAO and coordinating premiere events coinciding with the Nouns mint will be a key event over the course of all of the proposals. \n\nAll proceeds from the Drop Proposals will be split (60 [DAO] : 40 [Creators]) with the DAO.\n\n\n### Our North Star\nThe journey does not end at the final second of content upon release. Nouns ecosystem members will be invited to submit story arcs for the future and ideas for the next runs once the core foundation and engine have been established.\n\nWe aim to self distribute the media (via socials & other partners) and our own channels to the widest audience possible and aggregate as much meaningful data as possible for an eventual streaming distribution deal.\n\n----\n\n### Appendix\n\n\nSelf-sustaining creator flywheels\n[https://twitter.com/pbrianandj/status/1610695135414845440](https://twitter.com/pbrianandj/status/1610695135414845440)\n\nDevelop Film and TV like its 2023\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Iwy1zcJ.png)\n\n[https://pricepoint.substack.com/p/price-point-018-how-to-develop-film](https://pricepoint.substack.com/p/price-point-018-how-to-develop-film)\n[https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1613278290130931712](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1613278290130931712)\n[https://twitter.com/js_horne/status/1628203483949150208](https://twitter.com/js_horne/status/1628203483949150208)\n\n\nAtrium Multi-sig\n0x58947f539f1c1e930c2aea6e8a9fb0ecc9763357",

      "content": "# House of Nouns v2 (revised)\n\n![Proposal Lifecycle](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Proposal+Lifecycle+Small.gif)\n\nThis is a shortened version of our proposal. [**Read the full proposal and Q&A here.**](https://www.notion.so/collectivexyz/House-of-Nouns-v2-final-revision-97873114f37141b6995116178a76df00?pvs=4)\n\n# Tl;dr\nWe‚Äôre seeking 95 ETH of funding to continue developing House of Nouns for the next five months. Our goal is to expand House of Nouns from an MVP for voting into a full suite of tools that enables proposers and voters with an ideas board, drafts, feedback, Nounish integrations, and more places for discussion.\n\nMost importantly: We will open source the end product, so anyone can host, build on top of, and monetize the deliverables in this proposal. Nouns will have permanent access to House of Nouns via the open source infrastructure.\n\n*This is our third and final revision for House of Nouns. We have reduced the original budget by ~60% in USD, from 340 ETH ($420,000) to 95 ETH ($160,000). [Read the full proposal.](https://www.notion.so/collectivexyz/House-of-Nouns-v2-final-revision-97873114f37141b6995116178a76df00?pvs=4)*\n\n*Visit [houseofnouns.wtf](https://houseofnouns.wtf) to view our current MVP.*\n\n# Mission\nImprove Nouns governance by empowering Nouns to contribute, find consensus before going onchain, and vote confidently.\n\n# Why open source?\nPrimarily, open source ensures that House of Nouns will always be able to exist, regardless of any future funding. This creates public infrastructure for DAO governance that can be used by anyone, forever, funded by Nouns.\n\nAdditionally, there is no centralized value capture for [Collective](https://twitter.com/collectivexyz) (the company building House of Nouns) or anyone else. Anyone and everyone can build on top of it.\n\nWe believe the open-source, permissionless approach is inline with the ethos of Nouns, versus the alternative of closed-source, licensing of the product, subscriptions, or advertising.\n\n# With 20 ETH from Prop House, we‚Äôve‚Ä¶\n- Created an MVP used by ~26% of Nouns (incl. holders, proposers, & delegates)\n- Over 100% month-over-month growth (MAUs & views)\n- Fostered proposal discussion that is nowhere else\n- Become a go-to client for voting and discussion\n\n# Deliverables\nThese are the deliverables we‚Äôll guarantee to build over the next five months. We move quickly, and we‚Äôre excited to go above-and-beyond where applicable.\n\n### Pre-proposal Drafts Client\n- Goal: Makes the pre-proposal process public and collaborative.\n- Proposal drafts & versions, saving time with tedious markdown editing & feedback\n- Proposal templates \n- Inline commenting with ETH identities \n- Public revisions \n- One-click promote to onchain \n\n### Ideas Client\n- Goal: Post early stage ideas, generate support, and promote to a draft.\n- Reddit-like platform for voting on ideas\n- Upvoting and commenting tied to ETH identities\n- One-click promote to draft or ‚Äúlooking for sponsor‚Äù\n\n### Open-source Infrastructure\n- Goal: Eliminate barriers to building on Nouns governance, and allow anyone to self-host \n- API for all governance, discussion, profiles, etc.\n- Open source repository\n- Technical docs\n\n### Public good for all Nounish DAOs\n- Feed for activity across your DAOs\n- See to-dos and notifications across DAOs\n- Support for all Nouns forks\n\n### Integration of Nounish tools\n- We will use building blocks from the Nouns ecosystem where possible\n- Some ideas include but are not limited to: \n- Prop House voting \n- Agora delegate profiles\n- Federation DAO-to-DAO governance\n- Nouns AI pod summaries & context\n- Nouns Atlas search\n\n# Budget\nWe‚Äôre requesting **95 ETH for 5 months** for full-time development work from a team of four developers ‚Äî or ~5 ETH/developer/month. After revising our proposal and speaking with numerous members of the community, we believe this is fair and in line with standard service development costs.\n\nWe believe this budget is easily justified for deliverables that will positively impact decentralization, participation, and decision-making.\n\n# Team\n- [dadkins](https://twitter.com/dadkins_): longtime crypto hacker\n- [Wojciech Kocjan](https://twitter.com/w_kocjan): frontend & design engineer\n- Jamal Hashim: ex-Amazon, blockchain engineer\n- John Cairns: longtime crypto builder, ex-Gemini\n\nThis is a condensed version of the proposal.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 241 - Functional Props (Take 2)",
      "content": "# Functional Props (Take 2)\n\nNew text has been `highlighted` for easier differentiation between this prop and Prop 238.\n\n# TLDR\n\n1. `This is a resubmission of Prop 238, with a better explainer of the pros taking into account feedback, including two additional deliverables (and a bit higher ask for this reason).`\n2. Finish development, testing and deploy a generalized NFT random distributor which enables any proposer to propose distribution of current or future NFTs in our Treasury. The distributor makes use of new tech I call ‚Äúfunctional props‚Äù; meaning the prop itself determines how many NFTs to distribute at execution time as a function of the prop‚Äôs vote counts. `Now includes a Pull Request into the nouns.wtf front-end to allow for a better UX when proposing NFT distributions.`\n3. Develop, test, audit and deploy a contract that enables proposers to ask for functional funding. Functional funding allows proposers to suggest a funding range within which they are willing to execute a prop. The actual funding amount received is determined by the prop‚Äôs vote counts. `Now includes a Pull Request into the nouns.wtf front-end to allow for better UX when proposing range or milestone funding.`\n\n# Why Functional Props?\n\n*Cool tech, cool experiment. But how is it useful?*\n\n`Historically, all DAO proposals have had binary outcomes (pass or fail). The time has come to invent tooling for DAOs to allow for non-binary outcomes on votes, and for Nouns to lead the way on this.`\n\n`Take Prop 239 (comic book purchase) as an example. The DAO could be in agreement that it makes sense to purchase comic books, but not necessarily 5,000 of them. If the prop‚Äôs voting outcome were non-binary, the DAO would have had a way to simultaneously decide if it makes sense, and also how many comic books to print. Maybe the prop wouldn‚Äôt have had to be canceled.`\n\nFor both NFT distribution and funding it‚Äôs a more efficient way of achieving ‚Äúmiddle ground‚Äù; a form of consensus.\n\nThink about it as a way of taking an on-chain average of all opinions.\n\nThe current alternative is an attention-deprived off-chain back and forth between proponent and community to arrive at a proposal price point or distribution number.\n\n# `Past props where functional props would have been useful`\n\n`Prop 236: Wizard‚Äôs Hat ‚Äî determine the mint price of our NFT together at vote time, from a range.`\n\n`Prop 223: House of Nouns ‚Äî Implement milestones instead of all or nothing.  Milestones are mapped to voting tiers. The more popular the prop is at vote time, more funding is sent and more features get implemented.`\n\n`Prop 217: Stake an additional 5,000 ETH in LIDO ‚Äî instead stake between 1,000-5,000 depending on the level of support for the prop.`\n\n`Prop 206: Nouns on the Ground 2023 ‚Äî Do tiered funding (5, 10, or 15 IRL events) instead of all or nothing.`\n\n`Prop 202: nouns.eth set reverse record ‚Äî in addition to executing, do we also send 1 ETH to Jacob? Depending on the popularity of the prop, we send between 0-1ETH.`\n\n`Prop 184: Nouns funding ZachXBT ‚Äî fund within range 50-100 ETH, instead of all or nothing.`\n\n`Prop 167: Nouns Builder ‚Äî seed the Builder treasury within a range (e.g. 500-1,000 ETH).`\n\n`Prop 125: 8/8 anniversary art ‚Äî only change existing traits if the vote is unanimous.*`\n\n# `Answers to common doubts on functional funding`\n\n### `What if a proposer that is willing to do work for 30 ETH proposes a range of 30-50 ETH to squeeze out more from the DAO?`\n\n`A proposer is disincentivized to do so, as it increases the likelihood of the prop being defeated. It could also be argued conversely, that if functional funding wasn‚Äôt possible, the proposer could have proposed an all-or-nothing 50 ETH instead of a range where the DAO could save money if the prop passes, but barely. We can‚Äôt be certain if functional funding will make overall payouts larger or smaller, but we can be sure that funds will be allocated more efficiently as more granularity allows for concentrating capital where it needs to be.`\n\n### `If I support a proposal getting the lower part of the range, but not the upper part, how am I supposed to decide how to vote before the very last second?`\n\n`Granted that this is a tricky aspect of functional funding. I give a two-part answer:`\n\n`1. The question doesn‚Äôt apply to all props where functional funding could be useful. For example, take the hypothetical use for Prop 217 (staking in LIDO). If you are OK with staking 5,000 ETH, you are OK with staking 1,000. In this case, you it doesn‚Äôt really matter to you if you vote early or later. If you aren‚Äôt comfortable with staking up to 5,000 ETH, you vote against. You would have voted against Prop 217 in its non-functional funding incarnation anyway.`\n`2. Granted that those who vote later have more information than those who vote earlier. However, those that vote earlier likely are OK with the entire range. Those that vote later will have more influence over the outcome. This is a net positive: a. those who are OK with the entire range are happy. b. those who want to control the range, can do so by voting later.`\n\n### `Even though the tech is innovative, I don‚Äôt see it being widely adopted`\n\n`Refer to the section above where I highlight some use cases that make Nouns a more agile decision-making DAO.`\n\n### `The main mechanics of the DAO should stick to the KISS principle`\n\n`The concern is that it should be made as simple as possible for Nouners to vote. I agree that simpler is better. Most props will not make use of functional funding and will stick to KISS. However, for those that it makes sense to make outcomes functional, if it‚Äôs more efficient for the DAO, it‚Äôs worth the marginal complexity.`\n\n# Phase 1: Generalized NFT Distributor\n\nBefore functional funding comes functional NFT distribution.\n\nI am the dev and proposer behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) which passed 226 : 9. Prop 199 was a successful experiment to distribute 50 Nouns Vision Glasses from our Treasury to Nouners at random.\n\nI have developed (inspect code [here](https://github.com/0xDigitalOil/nouns-props/tree/master/GeneralizedNFTDistributor)) a generalized version of the Nouns Vision Glasses distributor that allows for any proposer to propose random distribution of any ERC-721 in our Treasury to Nouners. This included development of a generalized version of the BatchTransfer contract [9999.‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999) deployed for [Prop 185](https://nouns.wtf/vote/185).\n\nAs this deployment is not a one-off and meant to be a primitive the DAO can leverage at any time, plus the code is more complex, it requires more extensive testing. In addition, it requires a more complex custom front-end for the distribution claims.\n\n## `Why do we need a generalized NFT distributor?`\n\n`The Nouns DAO treasury continues to hoard NFTs as subDAOs such as Lil Nouns and Nouns Builder are ‚Äúpaying backwards‚Äù in the form of governance tokens.`\n\n`It is likely that as the Nouns meme proliferates, more and more subDAOs will continue to do the same.`\n\n`Historically, we haven‚Äôt used these NFTs to govern these subDAOs and to this date haven‚Äôt reached consensus as to whether it‚Äôs something we are interested in doing as a DAO.`\n\n`There is no point in having NFTs in our treasury that we don‚Äôt plan on using. If we are to go down the alternate path, who better than Nouners to receive them and participate in subDAO governance in an individual, more decentralized manner.`\n\n## Functional Distribution\n\nThe generalized NFT distributor has a new distribution mechanism baked in that allows the proposer to set the maximum number of NFTs to distribute. Then, if the prop passes, at execution time, the distribution contract calculates the number of NFTs to randomly distribute as a function of the vote (for, against, abstain) counts.\n\nThe proposer also selects the distribution amount calculation mechanism. This code extract shows the possible distribution rules the proposer can select from:\n\n![Proposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.](https://i.ibb.co/Gthy2Nj/Untitled.png)\n\nProposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.\n\nFor example, the proposer might want to propose a distribution of some LilNouns in the treasury. The proposer is unsure of how many LilNouns the DAO is willing to distribute so he/she selects VotesFor as the distribution mechanism. Thus, the higher ‚ÄúFor Vote‚Äù turnout (the more popular the prop was), the more LilNouns will be distributed. \n\n## Prop Execution\n\nHere‚Äôs how proposing and execution works:\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/nn33yHB/Untitled-1.png)\n\n# Phase 2: Functional Funding\n\nI call ‚Äúfunctional props‚Äù proposals that are self-referential at prop execution time. Initially I‚Äôm interested in exploring props that use vote counts (i.e., how many for/against/abstain) as inputs and take actions as a function of those inputs. We could imagine going beyond that to enable props that pull from a larger voter input-space such as vote reasons*.\n\nFunctional funding is a subset of functional props that enables an efficient way for the DAO to price proposals. The mechanism works as follows:\n\n1. Proposer writes a prop where he/she proposes to do some work for Nouns DAO.\n2. The proposer sets the prop transaction to call the FunctionalFunding contract and selects a funding range (e.g. 30-50 ETH) and distribution rule. This signals to the DAO that he/she is willing to do the work for a minimum of 30 ETH, but if the DAO as a whole signals that it values the work being done greatly (via strong FOR support), the proposer will get funded more than 30 ETH, up to 50 ETH.\n3. If the prop passes, when it executes it references itself, reading its vote counts to determine the funding amount according to the distribution rule.\n4. FunctionalFunding contract sends the calculated amount of ETH.\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/bgPmDV1/Untitled-2.png)\n\n## What does this solve?\n\nFor Proposers:\n\n- Allows the proposer to do an all-in-one price discovery by ‚Äúpolling‚Äù all voters on-chain\n- Lower probability of good proposals being rejected due to mere price ‚Üí avoids going back, adjusting price and resubmitting\n\nFor Voters:\n\n- Decision is less stressful as it‚Äôs less binary. You can be OK with the prop content and range and ‚Äúdelegate‚Äù decision of the price point to the rest of the voters\n\nFor Nouns DAO:\n\n- All-in-one prop voting and efficient price discovery\n- Proposals are more likely to be funded closer to ‚Äúfair price‚Äù than the current binary funding mechanism\n- `For the first time, allows the DAO to vote on proposals that need to pass unanimously to execute`\n\n# Deliverables\n\n1. Trustless, immutable primitive contract-set that allow Nouners to propose random distribution of NFTs, where the final number of NFTs distributed is a function of proposal popularity.\n2. Front-end for claiming NFTs of said distribution rounds. Allows for multiple distribution rounds per NFT collection.\n3. Trustless, immutable primitive contract that allow Nouners to create proposals that are funded within a range as a function of proposal popularity.\n4. `UI on [nouns.wtf](http://nouns.wtf) similar to the USDC converter, that allows proposers to select and input parameters for functional NFT distributions or funding.`\n\n# `Positive feedback on Prop 238`\n\n**`The innovative approach to Human Organization presented here is a promising addition to the Nouns toolkit, which continues to lead the way with innovative public goods. I support the continued exploration of fresh governance approaches, such as the \"Function Props\" concept, which can leverage the benefits of large group decision-making.`**\n\n**`I'm in favor of experimenting to find better mechanisms we can use to reach non-binary outcomes for proposals and for that reason I'm voting in favor. Even if this isn't used much or is used and we discover what the shortcoming is, that would be a plus in my book.`**\n\n**`I think that it is important for the DAO to continue to explore new ways to use governance to resolve conflict, and I see \"Function Props\" as a promising direction here. They could offer a way to take advantage of the concave decision making advantage of large groups: where any point along the spectrum from 0 to 1 is higher value than either a 0 or 1 outcome.`**\n\n**`innovative price discovery`**\n\n**`Great way to put the NFTs in the treasury to work!`**\n\n**`Sounds like this can be implemented, so I'm in full support. More than reasonable cost.`**\n\n**`Digitaloil is demonstrably dedicated, creative and aligned with Nouns long term and wants to try and build a useful Nounish primitive.  Let's see how he impresses.`**\n\n**`i think the cost is fair, and it could also lead to new ideas to improve or offer alternatives to the current proposal constraints.`**\n\n**`Nounish dev building nounish things - hopefully having funding methods like this save the dao money in the long term`**\n\n**`nounishly positive`**\n\n**`The range funding is the killer app here imo. Gives proposers with that flexibility the option to potentially get more vote support than a fixed rate.`**\n\n# Ask\n\n`38` ETH sent to me, [DigitalOil](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil). \n\nIf only I could propose a functional funding range ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.\n\n### Funding breakdown\n\n1. 15 ETH ‚Äî finish testing of NFT Distributor contracts. Develop generalized claim front-end.\n2. 20 ETH ‚Äî Develop functional funding contract, including contract audit.\n3. `3 ETH ‚Äî Pull requests into [nouns.wtf](http://nouns.wtf) front-end for a better UX and reduce friction when proposers choose to submit a functional prop instead of a binary prop.`\n\n*Note that using vote reasons as inputs to functional props would require a change to the governance contract as vote reasons are currently not introspectable at execution time.",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 240 - Nounish Dataverse, open source data",
      "content": "# Nounish Dataverse, open source data\n\n**TLDR**: Aggregating and organizing data from  applications, and making it open source and composable. The aggregated data will be published in a decentralized database and accessible through a GraphQL API.\n\n**Goal**: Our goal is to make it easier for people to use and control their data in the Nouniverse. We'll use [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/) and decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to achieve this, allowing data to flow more easily between different applications in the network. This will help solve issues with scattered/fragmented data and make it more easily available to everyone. We'll also establish a universal identity system to make it easier for different applications to share the same user account. Ultimately, we're working to create a reliable and efficient decentralized network that provides a better experience for users.\n\n![Qm-Toek-X1-Fsy-Dp-PXPn3mi-KPCns-VHy-Z6-H1-Pmka-A5qz4p-TVDj.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/T1Sn4xgM/Qm-Toek-X1-Fsy-Dp-PXPn3mi-KPCns-VHy-Z6-H1-Pmka-A5qz4p-TVDj.jpg)\n-   **What is the platform's function?** The platform can store and manage large amounts of data for decentralized protocols, allowing developers to easily create new applications that build upon existing data and contribute to the data graph.\n    \n- **What are the key benefits of the platform?** The platform enables innovative applications and user experiences, reduces data and application fragmentation, increases data sovereignty, facilitates integration and development, and improves interoperability and composability among participating applications.\n    \n-   **What problems are being addressed?** Universal identity, data and application fragmentation, data availability, and data composability.\n\n-   **Why can‚Äôt Ethereum be used to store the data?** ‚ÄúEthereum itself can be used as a decentralized storage system, and it is when it comes to code storage in all the smart contracts. However, when it comes to large amounts of data, that isn't what Ethereum was designed for. The chain is steadily growing, but at the time of writing, the Ethereum chain is around 500GB - 1TB (depending on the client), and every node on the network needs to be able to store all of the data. If the chain were to expand to large amounts of data (say 5TBs) it wouldn't be feasible for all nodes to continue to run. Also, the cost of deploying this much data to Mainnet would be prohibitively expensive due to gas fees.‚Äù - [Ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/bg/developers/docs/storage/)\n\n\n-   **Why is this platform preferable to IPFS, or similar solutions currently available in the market?**  We'll be using [ComposeDB](https://composedb.js.org/), which leverages Ceramic, a mutable layer for IPFS with anchoring on Ethereum for finality. By using Ceramic, the Nounish platform is able to provide faster data retrieval and processing, as well as advanced data management tools such as decentralized identifiers (DIDs) that enable greater control and ownership over data. \n\n- **Who are the team members?** **Baba**: 1 of 5 Nouns DAO Governance Prop House Mandate Winners, Datapod Co-Lead for Lil Nouns, Lil Nouns grants committee multi-sig signer. **Al409**: 2x Lil Noun DAO resident, and Agora Nouner Delegate Winner.  **Ripe, Volky**: Prop House Winners and BuilderDAO contributors. **Brunes, Champion Score**: Ex-Stripe, Ex-Google, and Nouns Governance Prop House Mandate Winners.\n\n## Problem Statement\nAs the DAO grows, people must navigate an environment that is increasingly fragmented. The data produced by many small and large applications are scattered, siloed and inconsistent in format and structure, making it difficult for users to access and utilize. This fragmentation lowers the accessibility, usability, and value of the data, and limits the potential insights and innovations that can be gained from it.\n\n  \n\nIn addition, only a small subset of all data in the Nouniverse is stored on-chain, which can create challenges for developers and users who need to access and use this data. In a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), data is a critical asset that drives decision-making, governance, and value creation. Therefore, it is important for a DAO to have a decentralized data network like Ceramic that provides users with greater control and ownership of their data, and enables interoperability and composability of data across different applications, including off-chain data.\n\n  \n**Vision**: In a future wherein permissionless data collaboration achieves critical mass within the DAO, users would have unprecedented control and ownership over their data, with the ability to easily share and reuse it across different participating applications. The decentralized nature of Ceramic would ensure that data is stored securely and efficiently, without the risk of censorship or centralization. The interoperability and composability enabled by Ceramic would lead to a proliferation of innovative and user-centric applications, breaking down the barriers that currently exist between different platforms and ecosystems. The benefits of this future would extend beyond just the technical members of the DAO, as all users would be able to take advantage of the seamless and intuitive interfaces enabled by the data network. The adoption of Ceramic would be a major step towards a more open and equitable internet, where data is treated as a commons to be shared and nurtured, rather than a commodity to be monetized and controlled.\n\n![Qm-Vda-PMMMe-Sj1-J6-RSeuizx-N1u-Bq-LAPc-N1f-G9phu-Uuv-Bk-Wb.png](https://i.postimg.cc/KzWKZNzt/Qm-Vda-PMMMe-Sj1-J6-RSeuizx-N1u-Bq-LAPc-N1f-G9phu-Uuv-Bk-Wb.png)\n\n## Objectives\n-   To create a decentralized data network and database that can make it easier for people to access, understand and use data in the Nouniverse.\n-   To give people more control and ownership over their data through the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs).\n-   To make it possible for different applications to share and use data, creating new possibilities for how data can be used.\n-   To provide developers with access to a permissionless data layer, which includes information on governance, funding, and user activity for the DAO.\n-   To make it easy for developers to integrate with and build on top of the data that the DAO has collected.\n-   To enable developers to tap into the network effects of the DAO by allowing their applications to connect and interact with each other.\n-   To enable a more open and equitable internet where data is treated as a shared resource rather than a commodity that can be controlled and monetized.\n\n## Deliverables - 3 Month Timeline\nTo achieve these objectives, we will deliver the following components: infrastructure, applications, and services.\n\n**Infrastructure**: The infrastructure component involves deploying a Ceramic network node that runs an instance of ComposeDB, a decentralized, composable graph database. This node will serve the applications, which can read and write data permissionlessly (subject to data ownership constraints). The raw data backing this database is stored in IPFS. In order to bootstrap application use cases, relevant on-chain and off-chain data will be imported, processed and stored into ComposeDB. The data will be attributed with relationships for composability and made available via a GraphQL API.\n\n**Applications**: Three applications will be deployed on the Ceramic network by the core team upon completion.\n\n-   **NounsID** - The identity interface for the Nouniverse. A user profile for participants of the Nouns ecosystem, composed of user-owned properties and relationships to data from sources such as on-chain proposals and votes, PropHouse, Snapshot and Discourse. The user-owned profile allows the user to control their represented identity, linking it to social media accounts, setting up their preferences and carrying them across application built atop the decentralized data layer.\n    \n-   **Builder Profile** - Builder profiles (nounish cv) are meant to give a full picture of a nounish builder's contributions to the Nouniverse, leveraging data aggregated from NounID, stored on the decentralized data layer.\n    \n-   **Noundry** - Will integrate with the Ceramic network, leveraging its decentralized datastore, and our universal identity (NounsID). Noundry Ceramic Integration may include but are not limited by the following features:\n    \n    -  Upload your traits once, use it all across the ecosystem! - Create your artist profile and keep your own provenance records - Include metadata with your artwork. Give it name & context.\n    - Remix & collab on everything, powered by CC0 Some ideas of integrations to harness this data: \n    - Noundry contests, to sign up your traits and try to make them into official Nouns traits. \n    - Builder DAO, to boot a new DAO with Nounish artwork using a collection of existing traits. \n    - Noun DAO UIs, to show tooltips over the Nouns with more info about the traits and their artists\n    - Other features to explore: cross-dao artwork compatibility by mapping out trait categories, templates, sizes & color palettes - Scraping of existing artwork and contacting artists to seed their profiles - Offering the artwork in multiple formats (svg, png) for better compatibility with different applications\n\n\n**Services**: \n- Throughout development, the team will provide weekly Q&A during office hours, hosted by The Noun Square. \n- The team will provide a JavaScript library that makes it easy for front-end applications to query and deploy their own data. \n- Finally, we will collaborate with AI Pod, providing the processed and formatted data relevant for training their models.\n\n## Deliverables:\n**Infrastructure Component:**\n-   **Nounish decentralized database**: We'll run a Ceramic and ComposeDB node that serves the data through a GraphQL API.\n- **Scrape/ingest real Nouns data sources**: Collect PropHouse, on-chain, Snapshot and Discourse data in near real-time, so that apps can query and compose them through our service.\n- **Client library for easy integration**: Provide a JavaScript library that client applications can use to easily query and publish data.\n- **Nouner preferences:** Deploy a Preferred proposal categories, optional social links, preferred Noun profile image and other .\n- **Support and/or integrate with partners and application developers**: Work with the community to brainstorm on new and existing models and incorporate feedback.\n    \n>**Note**: Part of this work has been started with 15k USD subsidized by the Ceramic builder grants.\n\n\n**Application Component:**\n-   **1st Party, Core Applications:** NounsID\n- **3rd Party, Nounish Partner Integrations:** Noundry Integration and Builder Profile\n\n**Services Component:**\n-   Provide ingested, and formatted data for AI Pod\n-   Provide developers with APIs and a library to leverage permissionless, composable databases as a service.\n-   Q&A with developers during regularly scheduled office hours on The Noun Square.\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n-   **Uptime**: Functional network with availability on-par with centralized databases.\n-   **Integrations**: Successful integration with launch partner - Noundry.\n-  **Composability**: One or more demonstrable (ideally novel) composable and interoperable application use cases from pre-existing applications in the Nouns ecosystem.\n-   **Partnerships**: Number of pre-existing nounish applications that commit, and follow through with network integrations in the ecosystem that leverage the network.\n- **Data Sources**: Amount of data sources integrated, and CRUD operations executed on Ceramic.\n\n## Future Work\n\n-   Expand data sources to eventually include all relevant data generated in the Nouniverse and make it permissionless and composable, along with publishing relevant metadata from applications running on the network.\n-   Create developer tools, documentation, and examples to make development easier for developers.\n-   Partnerships: Coordinate with Voters.wtf, Federation, Lil Nouns mainsite, and Apache SuperSet(Nouns Metrics), for potential network integration.\n\n## Team Structure & Budget\n\n- **Infrastructure, NounsID development:** \n    - Brunes: 7.75 ETH/Month\n    - Champion Score: 7.5 ETH/Month\n- **Technical Program & Partnership Management:** \n    -  Al409: 3 ETH/Month\n    -  Baba: 7 ETH/Month \n- **Integration Partners:** \n    - Volky: 3 ETH/Month\n    - Ripe: 3 ETH/Month\n- **Builder Grants**: ETH allocation to be used for Prop House rounds, and/or direct developer/builder integrations with Ceramic in order to bootstrap the network effects of our Nounish dataverse. Builder funds that are not used will be returned to NounsDAO treasury. \n    - 7.5 ETH/Month\n\n\n\n\n\n**Amount/Time**: 39 ETH/Month\n**Duration**: 3 months\n**Total**: 117 ETH",

To ensure maximum distribution of the comic, we propose that NounsDAO purchase and warehouse 5000 copies of each issue. Based on the best estimate of industry veteran Adam Fortier, the print run for each edition will be ~20,000 copies, giving the DAO approximately ¬º of the supply. ComicsDAO on behalf of NounsDAO will store the books in a warehouse in Maryland, a hub that can ship books to individuals, groups, or stores as they run out of stock.\n\nAdditionally, ‚ÄòNouns: Nountown‚Äô will be presented at Comicon San Diego and New York. These are the two largest events in comics, and we will bring copies of ‚ÄòNouns: Nountown‚Äô for the artist to sign at the convention, as well as copies to sell at the convention.\n\nNounsDAO (via ComicsDAO) will be able to accept orders through Titan Comics for fulfilment around the world, and ComicsDAO will set up an e-mail address for those that wish to use ETH or USDC to purchase books, with the proceeds going back into the Nouns Treasury as the comics are sold. Anyone that wants a book will be able to get one (until the stock is depleted).\n\nTerms\n\nEach issue is $5 USD, with 5,000 copies costing $25,000 USD. For 6 issues, that‚Äôs $150,000 USD, paid in USDC. Funds will be sent to the ComicsDAO/SharkDAO multisig from Prop 116.\n\nMultisig Address:\n0x4B4a63E170aAC970f45522fB6669a6f268CD672F\n",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 238 - Functional Props",
      "content": "# Functional Props\n\n# TLDR\n\n1. Finish development, testing and deploy a generalized NFT random distributor which enables any proposer to propose distribution of current or future NFTs in our Treasury. The distributor makes use of new tech I call ‚Äúfunctional props‚Äù; meaning the prop itself determines how many NFTs to distribute at execution time as a function of the prop‚Äôs vote counts.\n2. Develop, test, audit and deploy a contract that enables proposers to ask for functional funding. Functional funding allows proposers to suggest a funding range within which they are willing to execute a prop. The actual funding amount received is determined by the prop‚Äôs vote counts.\n\n# Why Functional Props?\n\n*Cool tech, cool experiment. But how is it useful?*\n\nFor both NFT distribution and funding it‚Äôs a more efficient way of achieving ‚Äúmiddle ground‚Äù; a form of consensus.\n\nThink about it as a way of taking an on-chain average of all opinions.\n\nThe current alternative is an attention-deprived off-chain back and forth between proponent and community to arrive at a proposal price point or distribution number.\n\nThis [back and forth I had with Gami](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil/status/1622308820658651139) goes deeper. An extract:\n\n### What stops people from just setting the lower threshold to their ideal amount and upper threshold as buffer?\n\nIf you set the lower threshold to ideal amount you increase the risk of the prop not passing vs a vanilla prop ceteris paribus.\n\n### As for the thresholds, how would voters know that proposer set their levels in such a way?\n\nVoters will know the range of funding. When voting, you know that if there is intense support, the prop will hit the upper part of the range. If it barely passes, it will hit the lower part.\n\nYou base your vote on that.\n\nIf you feel comfortable with the funding range, you vote FOR. The more people feel comfortable with the range, the higher the funding.\n\nIt gives quadratic funding vibes.\n\n### When put like that it feels like it would alleviate some of the anxiety around voting too. Like sharing the load in a clever way. Nice.\n\nRight. Well put. Like smoothing out the noise in a signal with a moving average filter.\n\n# Phase 1: Generalized NFT Distributor\n\nBefore functional funding comes functional NFT distribution.\n\nI am the dev and proposer behind [Prop 199](https://nouns.wtf/vote/199) which passed 226 : 9. Prop 199 was a successful experiment to distribute 50 Nouns Vision Glasses from our Treasury to Nouners at random.\n\nI have developed (inspect code [here](https://github.com/0xDigitalOil/nouns-props/tree/master/GeneralizedNFTDistributor)) a generalized version of the Nouns Vision Glasses distributor that allows for any proposer to propose random distribution of any ERC-721 in our Treasury to Nouners. This included development of a generalized version of the BatchTransfer contract [9999.‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999) deployed for [Prop 185](https://nouns.wtf/vote/185).\n\nAs this deployment is not a one-off and meant to be a primitive the DAO can leverage at any time, plus the code is more complex, it requires more extensive testing. In addition, it requires a more complex custom front-end for the distribution claims.\n\n## Functional Distribution\n\nThe generalized NFT distributor has a new distribution mechanism baked in that allows the proposer to set the maximum number of NFTs to distribute. Then, if the prop passes, at execution time, the distribution contract calculates the number of NFTs to randomly distribute as a function of the vote (for, against, abstain) counts.\n\nThe proposer also selects the distribution amount calculation mechanism. This code extract shows the possible distribution rules the proposer can select from:\n\n![Proposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.](https://i.ibb.co/Gthy2Nj/Untitled.png)\n\nProposer can select among the following distribution rules: Total turnout per Noun, Total Turnout minus abstain per Noun, For Votes, For Votes per Noun, For minus Against Votes, For minus Against Votes per Noun.\n\nFor example, the proposer might want to propose a distribution of some LilNouns in the treasury. The proposer is unsure of how many LilNouns the DAO is willing to distribute so he/she selects VotesFor as the distribution mechanism. Thus, the higher ‚ÄúFor Vote‚Äù turnout (the more popular the prop was), the more LilNouns will be distributed. \n\n## Prop Execution\n\nHere‚Äôs how proposing and execution works:\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/nn33yHB/Untitled-1.png)\n\n# Phase 2: Functional Funding\n\nI call ‚Äúfunctional props‚Äù proposals that are self-referential at prop execution time. Initially I‚Äôm interested in exploring props that use vote counts (i.e., how many for/against/abstain) as inputs and take actions as a function of those inputs. We could imagine going beyond that to enable props that pull from a larger voter input-space such as vote reasons*.\n\nFunctional funding is a subset of functional props that enables an efficient way for the DAO to price proposals. The mechanism works as follows:\n\n1. Proposer writes a prop where he/she proposes to do some work for Nouns DAO.\n2. The proposer sets the prop transaction to call the FunctionalFunding contract and selects a funding range (e.g. 30-50 ETH) and distribution rule. This signals to the DAO that he/she is willing to do the work for a minimum of 30 ETH, but if the DAO as a whole signals that it values the work being done greatly (via strong FOR support), the proposer will get funded more than 30 ETH, up to 50 ETH.\n3. If the prop passes, when it executes it references itself, reading its vote counts to determine the funding amount according to the distribution rule.\n4. FunctionalFunding contract sends the calculated amount of ETH.\n\n![Untitled](https://i.ibb.co/bgPmDV1/Untitled-2.png)\n\n## What does this solve?\n\nFor Proposers:\n\n- Allows the proposer to do an all-in-one price discovery by ‚Äúpolling‚Äù all voters on-chain\n- Lower probability of good proposals being rejected due to mere price ‚Üí avoids going back, adjusting price and resubmitting\n\nFor Voters:\n\n- Decision is less stressful as it‚Äôs less binary. You can be OK with the prop content and range and ‚Äúdelegate‚Äù price decision to the rest of the voters\n\nFor Nouns DAO:\n\n- All-in-one prop voting and efficient price discovery\n- Proposals are more likely to be funded closer to ‚Äúfair price‚Äù than the current binary funding mechanism\n\n# Deliverables\n\n1. Trustless, immutable primitive contract-set that allow Nouners to propose random distribution of NFTs, where the final number of NFTs distributed is a function of proposal popularity.\n2. Front-end for claiming NFTs of said distribution rounds. Allows for multiple distribution rounds per NFT collection.\n3. Trustless, immutable primitive contract that allow Nouners to create proposals that are funded within a range as a function of proposal popularity.\n\n# Ask\n\n35 ETH sent to me, [DigitalOil](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil). \n\nIf only I could propose a functional funding range ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.\n\n### Funding breakdown\n\n1. 15 ETH ‚Äî finish testing of NFT Distributor contracts. Develop generalized claim front-end.\n2. 20 ETH ‚Äî Develop functional funding contract, including contract audit.\n\n*Note that using vote reasons as inputs to functional props would require a change to the governance contract as vote reasons are currently not introspectable at execution time.",

      "content": "# The Wizard's Hat - Premiere & Mint\n\n[![Foo](https://i.imgur.com/eSGCQ8v.jpg)](https://youtu.be/XNgY40Qk970)\n\n[Watch the trailer here](https://youtu.be/XNgY40Qk970)\n\nThe first short film funded by Nouns DAO (prop 20) is ready for its premiere, so we are proposing that Nouns DAO launch the film with a premiere and timed open edition mint event, all in one, via this proposal.\n\nWhile it will be either the second or third ever DAO mint (depending on outcomes of current proposals), it will be the first ever DAO release of media (premiere) via a proposal. Upon execution, the mint and film will both be available here: [premiere.wtf](http://premiere.wtf/)\n\n_______________\n\nThe Wizards Hat has been a labor of love from its genesis to completion. Every aspect of the film from early pre-production art through to voice overs, sound design and animation has been toiled over, aiming to uphold a long-established artisan approach of traditional animation. The team has enjoyed every little step of the journey and we hope watching it is as magical as it has been making it.\n\nWe ended up writing a long form breakdown of Harriett - a bubbly wizard‚Äôs hat who always sees the cauldron half-full, and Grummelot - a grumpy old spellmaster stuck in his ways. An origin story and full season arcs are ready to be turned into a full animated series if the opportunity arises.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FY8CnDF.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KeV1Mnq.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gfer8kq.jpg)\n\n______________\n\n[Prop 190](https://nouns.wtf/vote/190) described an idea, that \"by minting... from the DAO via a proposal, it is becoming Nouns DAO canon. Similar to how the DAO added in new head attributes via a proposal, Nouns can continue to explore and experiment with new models of CC0 art and production and minting directly from the DAO is a new tool for the organization to directly release and distribute the most important artifacts from the community. It‚Äôs not hard to see how this can advance Nouns into a crypto-native form of Movie Studio, Production House, Art Museum and so on.\"\n\nThe film will be released as a timed open edition for a price of 0.05 ETH. This means it will be available for anyone to mint for the premiere week, which will be approximately the 20th Feb - 27th Feb, (beginning from proposal execution). Proceeds from sale will be split between Nouns DAO and the Wizards Hat production team 50/50.\n\nAgain, we echo the sentiment of [prop 190](https://nouns.wtf/vote/190): \"We are excited to experiment with DAO NFT releases as an additional value capture mechanism, and potentially create a simple and repeatable model for any creator, community and brand in the ecosystem to put forward amazing artifacts to be minted via Nouns.\"\n\nThis edition will be minted with [Zora](https://zora.co/), and will be available to mint onchain as well as watch the film at [premiere.wtf](http://premiere.wtf/) after the proposal is executed.\n\nFind out more about what we've been up to here: [twitter.com/nouns_stories](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories)\n\nNote: the Zora edition has been setup with the film's trailer as a placeholder, and will be swapped out to the final film upon execution, before transferring the contract ownership to the DAO.\n\n--------\n\n**Release Details:**\nTitle: The Wizard's Hat\n\n**Description:**\nThe Wizards Hat will be the first ever film premiere and second ever edition mint executed by Nouns DAO, created by Nouns Stories + Pixel.\n\n**Symbol:**\nNOUNSSTORIES0001\n\n**Edition Type:**\nTimed Open Edition\n\n**Start date (approx):**\nFeb 20th (12 days after proposal submitted)\n\n**End date:** \nFeb 27th (7 days after execution)\n\n**Price:**\n0.05 ETH\n\n**Split address:**\n0x77104f74F4fbDCf62b5bcB3D08cd12774f6e9998\n\n**Wizard Hat team address (Pixel):**\n0x5184782cC00E90D2E0C82A8f22729f7f38a572B8\n\n**Nouns DAO Treasury Address:**\n0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10\n\n**Note:**\ngoldy.eth (The Wizard Hat producer) is set as collection defaultAdmin to update any potentially issues with metadata + salesConfig upon contract deploy and will then transfer ownership to Nouns DAO Treasury Address when finalized.\n\n‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®",

They are delegated to the Nouncil as specified in the original proposal.\n\nThese Nouns are collectively owned by the DAO. As Nouncil has grown and developed its own culture that is distinct from the greater NounsDAO, this delegation is no longer appropriate. \n\nThis proposal instructs the NAC to:\n1) delegate these Nouns to itself (0x9298B97dE93784635900163e582A5D9e570f35a5)\n2) refrain from voting on future proposals.\n\nReferences:\nhttps://nouns.wtf/vote/44\n\n",

      "content": "# ‚ÄúMore Past than Future‚Äù - The first film fully funded by Nouns - Recording in Africa\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/skbu355.gif)\n\n**TLDR - Being the first feature film funded by Nouns, having the chance to take our Noggles to the main film festivals around the world and possibly being present in the main streaming catalogs.**\n\n**\"More Past than Future\"** is the project of a documentary that will be shot in the heart of Casamance (southern region of Senegal), a small Muslim village, a kind of mystical island protected by religious guides called Marabus. A deep dive into a new world, full of rites, music, magic, secrets, fascinating images and testimonies of real characters who try to survive and maintain their traditions, in the midst of a civil war and the reality of goods smuggling.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kcvr6oP.jpg)\n\n**TLDR - Graduated in cinema from Universit√© Lumi√®re Lyon II in France, Daniel Leite is Author / Director / Photographer / Producer of the documentary ‚ÄúKabadio - Here time is not in a hurry, it goes barefoot‚Äù. An independent production that played in more than 30 film festivals around the world, was part of important streaming catalogs such as Amazon Prime Video and received the Best Cinematography award at the 7th Festival Heritales - Lisbon, being watched by more than 300k people worldwide**.\n\n**[IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3365250/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1)**\n\n**Website Daniel - [www.danielleite.com.br](https://www.danielleite.com.br)**\n\n**Daniel's Producer Website - [www.domangfilmes.com.br](https://www.domangfilmes.com.br)**\n.\n\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/MREVFSG.jpg) ](https://vimeo.com/166749375)\n\n\n.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/F1p1Xub.jpg)\n\n.\n\n\n\n# **The project**\n\n![TOC](https://i.imgur.com/KuxOIe6.jpg)\n\n\nEngaged in Brazil national black cinema and after visiting the African continent many times, it was in 2006 that Daniel Leite started recording the feature film \"Kabadio, where time goes slowly, walks barefoot\". \n\nNow, 17 years later, Daniel intends to return to the African continent to meet characters who marked his lens. About 40 photos taken in 2006 were selected. Each photo has a story. They are portraits of the most varied possible, which will act as guides that will dictate the progress of our itinerary in the village.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rjrMvLM.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2MG7rXs.jpg)\n\n*What would it be like to meet the young Fatou N'Dei, now 20 years old?*\n\n*What stories does she carry with her?*\n\n*What was the village like for her at that time when you played in the rain?*\n\n*What was your father's fate, Badou?*\n\n*Did Fatou N'Dei follow the statistics and become a mother in her youth?*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/js6EJen.jpg)\n\n\nThe aim of the project is to make an observational documentary, sometimes poetic, sometimes in the photo essay and at other times with backstage coverage, with a making-of behavior camera. A cross between these subgenres will bring harmonic diversity, as the raw material will always be the same: the past of the people and the village. In the footsteps of photographer Daniel Leite will be followed by a small team ‚Äî which, with the necessary setback, will film these encounters. These same steps will be followed by the past, very closely with pictures the photographer produced in 2006. Whenever necessary, stories and images from the past will gain the screen, either by telling curiosities, or showing, through the contact sheet that will gain the canvas, the photographic step by step until the photo that he judged to be the main one.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/MM1pQio.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/426341855?embedded=true&source=video_title&owner=2297917)\n\n\n.\n\n\n# What we will deliver\n\n1. * **Nouns will sign as the sole sponsor of all works**\n1. * **The logo will appear on a animation card before the movie starts**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/buYkVSY.gif)\n\n1. * A feature film of at least 90 minutes entitled ‚ÄúMore past than future‚Äù\n\n1. * The logo will be present in all publicity material for the feature.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/o7EPDLq.jpg)\n\n1. * **A short film in a making-off style of at least 20 minutes, showing the entire process of the film, from capturing by Nouns, building our legacy and shooting the film.**\n1. * A 300 page black and white photo book telling what happened in the lives of the characters that will be re-photographed. Before and after portraits and small text extracts that punctuate the transformations of their lives in the span of 17 years.  Note: The book will be sold and all proceeds will revert to the village of Kabadio\n1. * **A Nounish action with the village football team (More details below)**\n1. * Photographic exhibition / Vernissage / Launch of the feature and book in RJ\n1. * **Entry of the feature film and short film on the world circuit of film festivals**\n1. * **All proceeds from the film will go entirely to Kabadio.**\n1. * Professional press office working on the promotion of the film\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m0jKyqO.jpg)\n\n# The legacy\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zMhlAWP.jpg)\n\n\nThe Casamansa region is a conflagrated region, there is a separatist war there that has lasted more than 30 years. The young people of Kabadio are leaving the village for Europe, through illegal and very dangerous routes. Some manage to finish the path, but they are shocked by the illegality in Europe, others disappear.\n\nThe rural exodus is currently one of the biggest problems in the region and that is why the Permakabadio association works directly with young people in order to avoid choosing this path.\n\nAmong the countless activities offered by Permakabadio, it was in football that they found their greatest strength. Called Asc Bindoula, the association's team was created in order to develop the concept of youth belonging to a much larger context.\n\nMore than 20 athletes work hard throughout the year with the aim of classifying the team in the biggest competition in the state of Casamansa, Intervilarejos, the real World Cup in the region.\n\nTaking place during Senegal's monsoon, one of the most difficult times of the year, where life becomes slow and all locomotion complex. Intervilarejo is a breather and a portal to a new competitive and festive reality.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LIC6Maz.jpg)\n[Permakabadio's Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/permakabadio)\n\nOur goal is to bring even more strength to the team and its athletes, so we want to sponsor the team next year through the following actions:\n\n* Buy of a new uniform with Nouns as a sponsor\n* Buy of sports equipment for the team (balls, cleats, shin guards‚Ä¶)\n* Workshop with local experts, players, coaches.\n* Renovation of the Kabadio football field\n* Construction of ASC Bindoula's CT (Meeting and Study Room)\n* Library around sports and decolonial themes\n* Buy a laptop for the trainer\n* Buy of a projector to be attached to the laptop for use in viewing games and tactics\n\nAll the amount raised with the release of the first feature was fully transferred to the village in the form of resources or support for projects.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AvhUsXB.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe facilitated the arrival of energy to the Bindoula permaculture farm, which today has 20 young people working directly in its operation. We helped in the construction of the Community Bakery located on the same farm, we donated half a ton of flour in order to speed up their bakery activities. In addition to donating food to the community and helping with emergencies in the village.\n\nIn this new project it will be no different, all the amount raised will be fully reverted to Kabadio and the maintenance of the legacy that Nouns will leave in the village.\n\n# Why Nouns should fund this proposal\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/K1ZKVE5.jpg)\n\n\n ‚ÄúMore past than future‚Äù talks about a people, a little visited part of Africa. Giving voice to its population is to bring out our ancestry, as it was from the Senegambia sector (where Kabadio is located) where the first Mandinga enslaved in the Africa x Brazil diasporic movement came from.\n\nThe potential of this project was already proven in our first feature, in which we were present in more than 40 film festivals, passing through 12 countries and remaining in the Amazon Prime Video documentary catalog for 2 years, being watched by more than 300k people worldwide.\n\nOur bonds are not frivolous, our relationships are not ephemeral. We have followed the life of this village for more than 15 years and we intend to participate more and more in its development.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1qJC2Tf.jpg)\n\n\nSponsoring our documentary and book gives Nouns the opportunity to take their glasses into the most prestigious film festivals in the world, project their brand into the streaming universe, participate in an arts publication of historical importance and thereby affirm even more the strength of the community and its ability to be involved in big projects.\n\nIn addition to the public understanding the importance of Nouns in carrying out these artistic projects, they will understand that it was the initial vector for a legacy that belongs to the village. The films and the book make up an archive that will be entirely dedicated to the village's causes until the end of time.\n\nOur cinema is humanitarian, all resources captured in this proposal will be donated to the village of Kabadio, located in the south of Senegal in the region of Casamance. Moving the local economy and leaving a true legacy for the people.\n\n# Budget\n\n**The amount requested is to finance the project for one year of work**\n\n**90 days** of Pre-production\n**45 days** of Recording \n**3 months** of Post-production \n**6 months** of Promotion *(festivals, streamers, social networks, newspapers, magazines and websites)*\n\n* **Team** \n    * Director / Director of Photography (Daniel Leite) - 5 ETH\n    * Director of Photography SEG UNIT (Felipe O'neill) - 2.5 ETH \n    * Sound Director (Wilson) - 2.5 ETH \n    * Camera Assistant / Logger (Hugo) - 2 ETH\n    * Producer / Director of Making Off (lcsant) - 5 ETH\n    * Local Producer (Mamadou Diop) - 2 ETH\n* Total - 19 ETH \n \n* **Equipment rental**\n    * Camera lenses and accessories - 2.5 ETH \n        * Black Magic 6k pro with extra batteries and cards\n        * Tripod Manfroto 504hd\n        * Fixed Lens Zeiss zf 18/25/35/50/85/100mm f:1.4 to f:2.8\n        * Lens Zooms: 24:70 / 16:35 / 70:200mm f:2.8\n        * TV Logic 5' monitor\n    * Sound equipment - 1.5 ETH \n        * Sound Device Recorder 788t\n        * Sound Console DeviCE CL-8\n        * BPL 130 vmont battery\n        * Sony urxb2 tx\n        * Sennheiser ew100g4 kits\n        * 1 boom pole -- ktec avalon CARBON\n        * Neumann Kmr 81i\n        * Haness orca or 40\n        * Tentacle sync box\n        * Electronic clapperboard deneck ts3\n    * HDs - 1 ETH\n* Total - 5 ETH \n\n* **Logistics and Production**\n    * Plane ticket Brazil X Africa - 7 ETH \n        * 5 two-way team tickets \n    * Local Transport - 2.5 ETH \n        * 2 car rental with local drivers for transport during the 45 days of travel\n    * Local Stay - 3.5 ETH \n        * Stay for a crew of 6 during the 45 days of shooting\n    * Food - 2 ETH \n        * Food for a team of 6 people during the 45 days of shooting\n* Total - 15 ETH \n\n* **Post production** (Budget for 3 months of post production)\n    * Film Editing 4 ETH \n    * Making-off Editting 1 ETH\n    * Sound Mixing 2.5 ETH\n    * Motion Designer 1.5 ETH \n    * Translation and Subtitles 2 ETH \n        * Both the film and the making-off will be translated and subtitled into Portuguese and English\n    * Photo book printing 4 ETH\n        * Writing / Revelation / Scanning: 2 Months\n        * Design/ Printing: 1 Month\n        * Distribution: 3 to 5 Months\n    * Film Disclosure 3 ETH\n        * 6 months of Promotion *(festivals, streamers, social networks, newspapers, magazines and websites)*\n* Total - 18 ETH\n\n* **Kabadio legacy**\n    * Purchase of a new uniform with Nouns as a sponsor 2 ETH\n    * Purchase of sports equipment for the team (balls, cleats, shin guards‚Ä¶) 1 ETH\n    * Workshop with local experts, players, coaches. 1.5 ETH\n    * Renovation of the Kabadio football field 2 ETH\n    * Construction of ASC Bindoula's CT (Meeting and Study Room) 3 ETH\n    * Library around sports and decolonial themes 1 ETH\n    * Purchase a laptop for the trainer 1 ETH\n    * Purchase of a projector to be attached to the laptop for use in viewing games and tactics 0.5 ETH\n* Total - 12 ETH\n\n* **TOTAL PROPOSAL** \n   \n   **69 ETH** \n\n.\n\n**Proposed Transactions**\n\n0x207a97e0d3339059C555D04374499c03Df47775D - lcsant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\n# Who is making the proposal - Lcsant\n\n**https://twitter.com/lcsant_eth**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cpqP0c5.jpg)",

      "content": "# Nouns x Nifty Gateway - Global arts & culture curated project\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pXun604.gif)\n\n**TL;DR - Requesting 30 ETH** to fund the first Nounish curated arts exhibition on Nifty Gateway, aimed at showcasing and proliferating Nouns globally. ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kP9GJS9.png)\n\nWith the recent focus on bringing more attention to Nouns by collaborating with creators, as seen in Proposals [181](https://nouns.wtf/vote/181) and [180](https://nouns.wtf/vote/180), we want to showcase Nouns in partnership with [Nifty Gateway](https://www.niftygateway.com/). \n\nA curated nounish collection of high caliber art from OG contributing artists (presented below) who are ready to celebrate Nouns in all its glory. This will provide another entry point for individuals to the Nouns ecosystem through fine art collecting on the Nifty Gateway platform.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zuADEJp.png)\n\nWe want to create a recurring exhibition that features custom Nounish pieces created by two artists from each continent, participating in the web3 ecosystem. One established and the other emerging. This will create a unique and limited collection, aligned with the Nouns ethos, allowing a new collective of talent to spread the good of Nouns, globally, through doing what they love.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/U9EK1gx.png)\n\n[Proposal 190](https://nouns.wtf/vote/190) has shown there is high demand to collect Nounish art pieces that are custom and crafted. 3,526 NFTs were minted as an open edition of one historical piece, and now we believe we can create something special that [Nifty Gateway](https://www.niftygateway.com/) collectors will flock to. \n\nThere is also clear evidence of fine-art generating profit and bringing awareness to Nouns in [Brandon Mighty's The Myth of Noun series on SuperRare.](https://superrare.com/series/0xca4607aad52f654cf6357895c397094c077a3236) Which has amassed 16.3 ETH in sales from a single artist's creations alone.\n\nRather than a one-off open edition mint of a historic piece or using one artist to tell the Nouns story, lets collaborate with many fine artists and give people beautiful Nounish art that they can collect and cherish.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Yd4uWoi.png)\n\nAll proceeds from the exhibition will be split 50/50 between the artists and the Nouns treasury. Not only does this provide fair compensation for the artists, but it also has the potential to generate returns for the DAO and further support its mission.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QOFD1dx.gif)\n\nWith Nifty Gateway's new exclusive publishers feature, it creates the perfect oppurtunity for Nouns to host a curated fine-art collection. Below are some stats on past Nifty drops, from the original Nifty Gateway Curated drops, to recent drops utilising the select publisher feature:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xe8iFr2.png)\n\nWe already have the storefront set up at [‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®.to/ng](https://xn----vpoz1kba.to/ng) and it's ready to fill with beautiful Nounish art. We'll commission two artists from each continent to create one Nounish piece of art each.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/woQncKS.png)\n\n The curated selection ranges from emerging Nounish artists to already established Web3 OG artists, to give opportunity and add high value to the collection. Each drop will have a theme that fits the Nouns ethos. People from around the world, doing what they love, all in the name of Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WYmZgQQ.jpg)\n\n[Serwah at SOTHEBY'S](https://www.serwah.xyz/digital-art?pgid=jrhqx2ul-037d6339-919c-429b-b349-7e936d2bebaa) | [MrSEAKs (RED) drop](https://linktr.ee/mrseaks)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/K0EQBUe.jpg)\n\n[Brandon Mighty on SuperRare](https://superrare.com/0xca4607aad52f654cf6357895c397094c077a3236/the-nouning-1) | [Zac Miller on Foundation](https://foundation.app/@zacmiller/foundation/17545)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Gd2jn4r.png)\n\n[Ilustradora Gnars Banner](https://mobile.twitter.com/ilustradoraeth/status/1570136843617992705) | [Desenhista It all started with a drawing](https://app.manifold.xyz/c/desenhista-open-edition)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/G7UHQ38.png)\n[EverFresh on SuperRare](https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/rainbow-vision-31386) | [Greta Gremplin Nounish self portrait](https://twitter.com/Greta_gremplin/status/1580331842447605760)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/shEGdOr.jpg)\n[Tujugila Bring It On](https://formfunction.xyz/@tujugila/ErYUuEczhg2eAZcXheAn24oxgcgUVPJghaCMEbySQ9ue) | [Ykha Amelz on SuperRare](https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/the-eye-of-the-storm-33673)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/T8T3Pyo.jpg)\n[Phil Heal on Foundation](https://foundation.app/@phil_heal/dam/5) | [Austine on SuperRare](https://superrare.com/0xa9cf3fb2c4538ac95e0c822758ec745fcfed8360/the-calling--141)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/l1UyEDt.png)\n\nEffective marketing of creative proposals is a common concern. We believe that through Nifty Gateway, the curated artists' networks and nouns related socials, we will generate the necessary hype and awareness for this proposal. [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/analytics/traffic/overview/?q=niftygateway.com&searchType=domain&compareWith=superrare.com:domain%7Cfoundation.app:domain%7Cnouns.wtf:domain) traffic estimates show ~ 668k unique visitors to niftygateway.com over the last 30 days.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/g123Tii.png)\n\nAs this Nouns fine art collection grows, along with a growing artist roster, the marketing efforts will snowball, thanks to the commitment of our collaborating artists and their collective audience across socials:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MccRngm.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jjapKkC.png)\n\nWith a 50/50 split between the DAO and each artist, this prop has the potential to return the funds requested and then some. \n\n**Requesting 30 ETH funding:**\n\n- Artwork creation 2 ETH per artist = 24 ETH\n- Curation, promo and organisation = 6 ETH\n\n**[Safe multisig](https://app.safe.global/eth:0xE1FAd61975f0D515C2695F654ca9c4031780Ea58/home) signers:**\n\n- mrseaks.eth\n- 0xigami.eth\n- benbodhi.eth\n\nWe expect delivery of the first drop in May/June, allowing each of the artists ample time, while being respectful of the space required to create meaningful work that makes a lasting impression.\n\nThank you nouners, for your time and consideration.\n\n[Mr Seaks](https://twitter.com/SeaksMr) ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®",

      "content": "# Federation\n\n[![intro](https://i.postimg.cc/wjpL0JVy/intro.png)](https://postimg.cc/ZCwWqWX4)\n\nLil Nouns, Gnars, Goop (and many others), are examples of projects that have acquired Nouns so that they can participate in governance.\n\nSince there are no solutions for giving each member a voice in Nouns proposals, communities rely on delegates to cast votes on their behalf. Resulting in a community that feels less connected to Nouns, because they cannot participate directly in the governance process.\n\n**Federation closes this gap by providing a way for communities to directly vote on Nouns proposals onchain. We call this crossDAO governance.**\n\n[![goal](https://i.postimg.cc/DwhF0yv3/Untitled.png)](https://postimg.cc/VdK2Hw0K)\n\nMoving forward we are extending Federation to support all forms of governance in the ecosystem such as integrating with Prop House and Nouns Builder, while also providing opportunities for owners of Nouns to generate value from them through new experiments like vote bidding.\n\nTo do this, we are seeking 225 ETH in funding to continue the development of Federation.\n\n# Team \n[wiz](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_) - creator [federation](https://federation.wtf); [Wizards DAO](https://wizardsdao.com); [delegate](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/oxwiz.eth);\n\n[ripe](https://twitter.com/ripe0x) - Nounish builder and [delegate](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/ripe0x.eth). Designer, and developer with over 15 years of experience creating digital products & websites and winner of multiple Nouns Prop House rounds. A few Nounish contributions include:¬†[Nouns Explore on nouns.wtf](https://nouns.wtf/explore),¬†[Nounish CV (prototype)](https://nounish.netlify.app/),¬†[nogs.wtf,](https://www.nogs.wtf/) [zorggles.wtf](http://zorggles.wtf/), [Noggle Factory](https://www.nogglefactory.wtf/)¬†&¬†[‚åê‚óß-‚óß.app](https://github.com/ripe0x/noggles.app)\n\n[![timeline](https://i.postimg.cc/nrGPRm5H/timeline.png)](https://postimg.cc/jnCcCDt9)\n# Progress\nAs a winner of the [Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/nouns-governance-clients) mandated governance round (Aug ‚Äò22), wiz took Federation from an idea to public infrastructure used by communities in the ecosystem. All code is open source and has been publicly available since the very first commit: [federation repository](https://github.com/nounish/federation/). \n\nMetrics:\n- 40+ Nouns proposal votes cast through Federation contracts\n- 5+ Nouns delegated to Federation contracts\n- Proposal passed for Lil Nouns adoption (which holds 16 Nouns)\n\nCommunities currently on Federation:\n- [Gnars](https://gnars.wtf/) \n- Goop Troop\n\nComing to Federation:\n- [Lil Nouns](https://lilnouns.wtf/)\n- [The Park](https://twitter.com/thepark)\n- [Wizards DAO](https://wizardsdao.com)\n\nDiscussions are currently underway to onboard other communities in the ecosystem that have expressed interest in using Federation such as [SharkDAO](https://sharks.wtf/), [Purple](https://purple.construction/), and [PGodjira](https://twitter.com/pgodjira)\n\n# Future roadmap and outcomes\n[![crossdaomock](https://i.postimg.cc/tgfdbgPF/crossdaomock.png)](https://postimg.cc/v1rxLb0m)\n\nWe believe it‚Äôs time to take Federation from a POC to a scalable protocol designed for participating in crossDAO governance and generating value from Nouns ownership.\n\n## Make crossDAO governance easy to understand, simple to do, and commonplace\n- Design & build the new Federation v1 application and website\n- Simplify the process of casting votes as a community\n- Enable support for existing and future Nounish DAOs created via Nouns builder\n- Continue onboarding Noun holding communities to Federation\n- Community voting in Prop House rounds\n- Optimize contracts to reduce storage costs, provide gas refunds, and execution incentives (MEV)\n- Self directed contract deployment and management\n\n## AutoBidder and Ongoing experimention\nWe plan to continuously release experiments that add value to the Nouns ecosystem. One area we are going to explore is an auto-bidder that enables a MEV driven approach to participating in Nouns auctions for communities and individuals.\n- Allows bidding on Nouns auctions automatically\n- Configurable max bid amounts\n- Gas refunds and execution incentives\n\n## Vote bidding\n[![votebidding](https://i.postimg.cc/L85ZspmD/bidonvotes.png)](https://postimg.cc/cvqJDPgt)\n\nExperimentation with crossDAO governance has led to the creation of a [novel vote bidding protocol](https://github.com/nounish/federation/commit/4ab02886abd26d405791fc399db57cc01034cd6b) aimed at giving Nouns holders the ability to monetize their governance rights. Turning the acquisition of a Noun into a revenue generating opportunity for individuals and communities alike.\n\nIn January, we ran an experiment auctioning off a **SINGLE** Noun vote. This led to the following metrics one week after launch:\n- 2 unique bidders\n- 3 votes cast\n- 0.5 ETH value created\n\nThere is a lot more value that can be unlocked with vote bidding and we want to heavily invest in its future development. You can learn more and see it in action by visiting [bids.federation.wtf](http://bids.federation.wtf).\n\n## Community outreach, supportive content and learning material\nIn addition to product development, we will focus on creating content that introduces people to the concepts and benefits of crossDAO governance and vote bidding, and tutorials that show interesting ways that these primitives can be used in the Nouns ecosystem. For example, teaching others how to use Federation with Nouns builder, PartyBid, or showing others how to stand up their own voting blocs (political parties).\n\n# Ask\n**225 ETH** to fund the continued development of [federation.wtf](http://federation.wtf) and its ecosystem for at least 6 months. (There are no plans to stop development after)\n- Engineering and Design (175 ETH)\n- OpEx including infrastructure costs, bounties, artwork, content, marketing (50 ETH)\n\nIf this proposal passes 1/2 of the funds will immediately be released to the team. The remainder will be held in a 3/5 multisig with the following signers:\n\n- [wiz](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_)\n- [ripe](https://twitter.com/ripe0x)\n- [krel](https://twitter.com/krel404)\n- [tmobil](https://twitter.com/TM0B1L)\n- [al409](https://twitter.com/7x7x7eth)\n\n# Previous Funding\n20 ETH awarded for winning the Prop House mandated governance round (Aug ‚Äò22). This was followed by a 12 ETH grant from Lil Nouns.\n\n# Path to Sustainability\nIt is important for us to stay lean while developing Federation. To ensure this is the case, we believe pursuing funding from Nouns is the best option in the short term.\n\nIn the future, we see Federation becoming sustainable through the creation of its own Nouns Builder DAO.\n\n# Relevant Links\nFederation\nweb app: [https://www.federation.wtf/](https://www.federation.wtf/)\nvote bidding experiment: [https://bids.federation.wtf/](https://www.federation.wtf/)\ngithub: [https://github.com/nounish/federation](https://github.com/nounish/federation)\n\nTeam\nwiz: [https://twitter.com/0xWiz_](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_)\nripe: [https://twitter.com/ripe0x](https://twitter.com/ripe0x)\n\n‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®",

We even managed to squeeze an extra month of operations out of our budget by creating a game ([NOMO Nouns](https://nomo.wtf)) that has generated 7 ETH for the show during its beta release alone.** \n\n**Our proposed budget for the next 6 months of continued media growth and Community-As-A-Service to the DAO is 319 ETH (53 per month, including funds ear-marked for art contests and community project grants.) However, we are committing to self-raising 50 ETH of revenue through several crypto-native and media-native strategies.** \n \n**Therefore, our ask of the DAO today is *269 ETH.*  Please read on to

Nouns.\"* This prop was structured to cover art contest prizes, operations and team compensation for 5 months, ending Dec 31/2022. \n\n**During that time, our team has met and surpassed ALL of the broad goals and specific metrics that we set out for ourselves in that proposal, and we've even stretched our operations an additional bonus month with careful budgeting and some supplemental internal revenue generation.**\n\n## **In the past 6 months we have:**\n\n‚úÖ  **accumulated over 36K followers across TNS socials**\n‚úÖ  **went viral on

(Sufficiently Decentralized) Media Company:\n\n\n\nThe TNS Team is very proud to have produced an engaging and well-attended [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) Spaces Show called Noun O' Clock LIVE **every single day** since June 13, 2022. \n\n## **That's 230+ days in a row!**\n\nWe have hosted many marquee guests during this time such as [Mike Demarais](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1gqxvyAqvrQJB), [Alana and Jesse from Variant Fund](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1ypKddjZmwvKW), [Farokh and Mando of

Carson](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1600721492718649345?s=20&t=orcqkvWL1S150I6hm-oBzQ)... plus many brand new Nouners, and countless interesting nounish builders and artists.\n\nOver the past 6 months, we have accumulated nearly **57K total [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) listens to our spaces,** hosting a total of **580 unique spaces**, including our flagship daily NOC LIVE and a slate of weekly community spaces through a new program called **The SoapBox.**\n\n\n[![twitter-listens-graphic.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/sxtJ87K3/twitter-listens-graphic.gif)](https://postimg.cc/vxt9x1pK)\n*Twitter Spaces Metrics: Up and to the Right*\n\n## What is The Noun Square SoapBox?\n\nThe SoapBox Network was developed by TNS as a way to leverage our platform to provide Nounish communities with a voice, as well as opportunities to cross-pollinate and collaborate with other groups in the ecosystem.\n\n*If The Noun Square is meant to depict an old town plaza with a clocktower in the centre, **The SoapBox** imagery might evoke passionate nounish subcommunities such as [Lil Nouns](https://lilnouns.wtf), [Food Nouns](https://foodnouns.wtf) and [Gnars](https://gnars.wtf) dragging a soapbox into the Square to stand atop and give a rousing speech to their own community of nounsfolk.*\n\nStepping back out of the realm of metaphor, SoapBox is, simply put, a Network that allows any community in the orbit of Nouns to host weekly Twitter Spaces on [The Noun Square Twitter account](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) (usually co-hosted from their own account), allowing them to bootstrap an audience that is comprised of a mix of their own fans, TNS's unique community, and spillover audiences from other SoapBoxes as well. \n\n[![gami-quote-prop-correct.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/kg2nQDSm/gami-quote-prop-correct.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/68NJwWzj)\n\n[![brennen-testimonial.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/MH6XJkdY/brennen-testimonial.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/gX7G379w)\n*Nouners Gami and Brennen (of Gnars and Nouns Esports respectively) on their experience with SoapBox*\n\n\nAt present, we are hosting approximately **38 Twitter interesting and well-attended spaces per week**, including our daily  Noun O' Clock spaces and the various TNS Soapboxes. \n\n# Twitter Engagement \n\nIn addition to our healthy Twitter Spaces metrics, TNS also has a robust track record of increasing both unique impressions and 100% organic engagement on Twitter, from a combination of art contests and games, as well as cross-posting quality nounish content from other accounts and communities too. \n\n[![twitter-engagement-chart.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/2SWdK01J/twitter-engagement-chart.gif)](https://postimg.cc/Yvpm4fff)\n*Impress-ive Numbers*\n\nAt the time of our previous Proposal, we had achieved 1.2MM impressions across all our posts, and the baseline trend through to present would have carried us to about 3MM impressions. \n\n**In reality, our impression growth has been exponential, with a 5X increase to over 5.4MM in a 5 month period.** (See chart above.) \n\nSimilarly, our Profile Visits were up **4.6X to 446K**, and we completely blew through our previous Proposal goal of 5000 followers, as we are trending towards **close to 6000 Twitter followers as of this proposal.** \n\nHere is a screenshot from Prop 128 showing our year-end goals for Twitter followers and daily Spaces Listens, both of which we have exceeded (6000 vs. 5000 and 380+ vs. 200 respectively):\n\n[![follower-goal.png](https://i.postimg.cc/XvGwCQbx/follower-goal.png)](https://postimg.cc/1gSnx04N)\n\n# Other Media Channels\n\nAlthough the focus of Prop 128 was growing our Twitter Spaces reach and onboarding artists and creators to Nouns, part of our vision for this time was also to begin experimenting with content for other platforms such as YouTube and TikTok, to complement our Twitter content strategy. We have had some success with both of these platforms during this trial, especially on TikTok (where we went viral in December and continue to get great numbers.)\n\n## TikTok\n\n[NounFungibleNikki](https://twitter.com/web3nikki) and [Hypnos](https://twitter.com/hypnoseffect) had been working as a team on a Nounish [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thenounsquare) presence for the NounsNews Project, before that project was discontinued in the fall.\n\nSeeing their impressive efforts and consistency, TNS approached and asked them to join forces and **merge our TikTok accounts together under the TNS banner.** *(Was this the first Nounish Acquisition in history? Maybe not explicitly, but it was nonetheless the beginning of an amazing collaborative relationship that has produced some of our most popular and viral nounish content over the past months.)*\n\nShortly after bringing Nikki and Hypnos into the TNS team, we also saw that [JP](https://twitter.com/eusou_jp) had been getting some really impressive attention on TikToks he had created for a Brazilian Noggle sticker campaign [\"Encontre o adesivo.\"](https://www.tiktok.com/@encontreoadesivo?_t=8ZOeB0NEt9x&_r=1) We invited him to join the team, both to run a Portuguese Language TNS TikTok Account, and to advise Nikki and Hypnos on English language TT content strategy as well.\n\n**Under the guidance of this new team, the growth of our TikTok presence has been nothing short of incredible; from a baseline of 37,000 views in September, to a steady ~100K in October and November, and then spiking dramatically to over 8 million views in the month of December:**\n\n[![tiktok-metrics-prop.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/RVh8YxQ0/tiktok-metrics-prop.gif)](https://postimg.cc/xcrtk7Zr)\n*Exponential TikTok Audience growth.*\n\nA clever video collaboration between JP on the [TNS Brazil account](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkge7F/) and N/H on the [main TNS account](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLk4k7G/) managed to go viral twice, one version on each account. After this video (a lighthearted curiosity-hook about nounish tattoos), many of our other videos, including trend videos, interviews and educational shorts, began to accumulate views and organic engagement as well. \n\nFor example, check out this TikTok re-packaging of an [@Nounish video](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkvGGQ/) (with their permission) with **nearly 30K views.** Or this video of Nikki interviewing a [Nouns Vision-wearing Farokh at Art Basel](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkvGGQ/), with **almost 80K views.** Or this [followup to the tattoo video](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkgxjT/) where Nikki explains what Noggles and Nouns are, which has just under **70 thousand views** so far as well. \n\n[![tiktok-thumbnails.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/rFKPygFN/tiktok-thumbnails.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/qzHLjsKN)\n\nWe also ran a very successful Public Good contest on TikTok called **#NounsGiveBack**, calling on our viewers and community to **do something good** in their local community and submit a video showing what they'd done. We had participants from all over the world who submitted some really inspiring entries. \n\nThe hashtag #NounsGiveBack on TT has received **over 300K views** across our own posts and all of the entries to date. A 2-minute recap video summarizing many of the amazing submissions has received **over 32.5K views** as well, [you can watch it here.](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMYLkb4JM/) We are planning to launch a second Public Good contest as well in the coming weeks using the same hashtag. \n\nAt present, both TNS TikTok accounts have amassed over 30,000 combined unique followers, over 850K \"Likes\" across our videos, and nearly 8.5MM total views on all videos. For more metrics, our TikTok team has prepared a short deck that provides some additional details and insights [here.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1d_ezmaSVbTC345t0W33Py_PmIXrVdXrTO9xnxPYalIY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**This is a huge opportunity to proliferate Nouns, especially to a younger generation of artists and builders, and we are excited to see what the TNS TikTok Dream Team can achieve over the next 6 months with a renewed mandate and continued enthusiasm.**\n\n## YouTube\n\nWe have also begun some experimentation on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@thenounsquare) in 3 main ways during this proposal period: \n1) Streaming all notable Twitter Spaces to YT Live for alternate tune-in and listen-back options; \n2) Creating and hosting evergreen/educational nounish video content; and \n3) Hosting/re-hosting of co-br\n\n\n---\n\nTHIS PROP IS LONGER THAN THE MAX LENGTH FOR SNAPSHOT:\n\n Read the rest of the prop at https://nouns.wtf/vote/226",

Already in conversations with iconic musicians and reputable foundations- we will make a major ripple in the lives of musicians, music fans, music education and overall- **Nounish proliferation.** \n\nOver a 6 month period, our goal is to onboard and empower musicians, build upon the existing Noun Sounds platform, create a DAO structure and develop new systems for **musicians and music lovers to create, share and participate in Noun Sounds**- building a self-sustaining community around all things music.\n\n## **Total: 245.5 ETH**\n\n*(See bottom of proposal for funding breakdown)*\n\n## Proposal Outline\n\nFrom January-June 2023, Noun Sounds Pod will:\n\n‚Üí  **Empower + Onboard Musicians** \n\n‚Üí  **Further Develop Nouns Sounds Platform** \n\n‚Üí  **Nounish Partnerships** \n\n‚Üí **Create Noun Sounds DAO**\n\n## Empowering + Onboarding Musicians\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DvdegTr.jpg)\n\nOne of our top initiatives is to empower musicians through funding and community building.  Our initial conversations include: \n\n- **Large-scale Artist 61ETH**\n    - **Ghostface Killah from Wu-Tang Clan:** *in discussions about making a CC0 song and sound pack for Noun Sounds + a photoshoot with the Noggles glasses.  Ghost has millions of fans and he digs the Noggles.*\n    \n        - *If the collaboration with Ghostface Killah does not happen, the full 61ETH will be sent back to NounsDAO*\n\n- **Indie-artist 23ETH**\n    - **Lisa Caruso:** *A talented indie artist from Australia, Lisa has had her music featured on major network TV shows and has released a slew of cool music and visuals.  Our plan is to create a Nounish E.P. and sound pack with her + a mini-doc following her creative process.*\n- **Prop House x Noun Sounds 19.5ETH**\n    \n    We will be leveraging Prop House rounds for musicians to onboard new talent for songs, sounds, music videos and more.  One Prop House round every month for 6 months:\n    \n    - **2ETH x 5** - *Musicians will submit their music catalog and NS voters will choose (5) artists to make a new Nounish CC0 song/beat.*\n    - **1ETH x 5** - *Musicians will submit their music catalog and be hired to create a CC0 sample pack containing loops and samples.*\n    - **.5ETH x 4** - *Creators can make a video for Save The Music with the purpose of amassing educational content for students (i.e. ‚ÄúHow To Play The Guitar 101‚Äù).*\n    - **.25ETH x 10** - *Anyone can submit their audio catalog and NS holders will vote for artists to create new CC0 sound effects and real-world sounds (i.e. recording the ocean or other foley sounds)*\n\n## Further Develop Nouns Sounds Platform\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VmKPbpi.png)\n\nPart of our MVP was building out the PLAYground section of the Noun Sounds website.  Building upon this, we will be creating new tools and features within the NS platform as we grow our pod:\n\n- **Mint Playlists: The Nouns Player**\n    - Meet the **Nouns Player companion**: A free *‚ÄúWinamp‚Äù-style audio player that will be able to pull music from Spotify, read from the playlists and allow you to enjoy each **curation**.*\n    - Creators will be able to mint playlists of songs and podcasts from their catalogues. Taste-Makers and Curators will be able capture a moment in time and create communities around each of them.\n    - This not only allows artists to create but also empowers one of the most important thing in music: **curation**.\n    - *Each Nouns Player will have the option of creating custom skins for their companion.* Thus, the Playlist Creator will come along with an **Album Art and ‚ÄúSkins‚Äù creator tool** for the music player.\n    - These playlists will allow creators and curators to offer token gated content (on their websites or through channels in their discords) based on each of their mintable playlists.\n- **Artist Profiles**\n    - *Artists and creators* will be able to setup their own custom page to showoff their catalogue and give updates. You‚Äôll be able to read about their work, see what packs they‚Äôre just released, or check out what playlists are currently minting.\n- **Profesional** **Music Creator Tools**\n    - **VST Instruments:** *Offering tools to experienced musicians*, we will be creating professional instruments that can be used in music-making programs. From keyboards, vocals, synths, drums and more- music makers can download, install and get to making their own Noun Sounds within their existing audio workstation.\n    - **Soundboard:** A fully functional CC0 soundboard on Noun Sounds for use across all Twitter Spaces and more. One of our most requested features.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2og8Ys1.png)\n\n\n\n## Nounish Partnerships\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PH0pU8p.png)\n\nPartnering with **[Save The Music](https://www.savethemusic.org/)**, we will proliferate the good vibes via IRL impacts and educational experiences. Save The Music partners with school districts and local communities to build sustainable music programs. Noun Sounds will start by running a Prop House with STM and include the partnership in future DAO proposals, while assisting them in the web3 landscape. \n\n\n## Noun Sounds DAO\n![](https://i.imgur.com/lyE5x23.png)\n\nUsing the Nouns Builder, Noun Sounds will create a daily auction to onboard new users into the Noun Sounds ecosystem.  Holding a Noun Sounds NFT allows you to put proposals on chain, vote on proposals and have an overall voice in the direction of the Noun Sounds treasury and growth.\n\n## Costs Breakdown\n\n**103.5ETH -** Onboarding world-renowned and indie musicians via collaborations and Prop House rounds.\n\n**67ETH -** SuperTightWoody- DAO partnerships, operations, music/content production, music communications and community management.\n\n**67ETH -** Papaya - Platform upgrades, CC0 music onboarding flow, mintable ‚ÄúWinamp‚Äù-style Nouns Player tools: playlist maker via Spotify API and custom player ‚ÄúSkins‚Äù art tools, professional CC0 music tools: DAW/Kontakt VST and soundboard.\n\n**8ETH** - Reserved for lawyer fees; we will need contracts and legal advice on releasing creators music as CC0.\n\n## **Total: 245.5 ETH**\n\n**Multisig Wallet Signers (3/4):**\n*SuperTightWoody\nPapaya\nKerimbonia\nBehbodhi*\n",

Our proprietary robotic painting technology allows digital artists to transport their creativity into the physical world. With Artmatr, the artist‚Äôs only limitation is their creativity, not their tool kit.![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/7583/C1ZjwW.jpg)\n\nOur proposal is to collaborate with Nouns to create beautifully fabricated, one-of-a-kind pieces of art. We will then plan and produce an event to exhibit the works, and help promote Nouns to the traditional gallery world and more traditional collectors as well as gathering the Nouns community under one roof to celebrate Nouns entering the physical world. In summary, our proposal is:\n\n*   Artmatr will fabricate one 4‚Äôx5‚Äô Nouns¬†painting per Nouns auction over a 7-day period; totalling 7 paintings\n\n![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/5907/3H3WmQ.jpg)\n\n*   Winners of each Noun auction will receive the rights to own the associated Nouns painting for free\n*   After the conclusion of the 7-day period, Artmatr will produce an exhibition in our [art gallery in](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://goo.gl/maps/dCmvmG7ruiKtn9dx9&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650902936&usg=AOvVaw1vlb_cXroi_-LXPqRfHqz_) [Brooklyn, NY](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://goo.gl/maps/dCmvmG7ruiKtn9dx9&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650903239&usg=AOvVaw2JAnFaoYhOb4LTY-TPE83_)\n\n![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/5866/lh3A8X.png)\n\n*   Artmatr will live-stream¬†the fabrication process during the 7-day production period in parallel with auctions; streamed on Twitch. Fabrications will begin around 10am EST each day.\n*   Artmatr will create a short promotional video to explain how Nouns and Artmatr are partnering to demonstrate how DAOs can have real-world applications in art; bridging digital and physical worlds of art.\n\nWe expect to add real value to the DAO by generating a premium on auction prices because the physical pieces will be sold together with the Nouns auction. For reference, the latest Artmatr-fabricated artwork (for a digital-native artist) sold for more than $250K.\n\nWe hope to leverage this experience to explore future collaborations, including fabricating existing Nouns.\n\n[](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://vimeo.com/792337208&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650904656&usg=AOvVaw0vOizFKZbzuEhMIqLR8lcK)¬†\n\n* * *\n\nTHE PROCESS\n===========\n\nOur goal is to create beautiful artworks that will proudly represent Nouns in the real world.\n\n[Nouns](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/nouns-57a91c516c94494984d28039b16f4106?utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=share-popup&utm_content=57a91c516c94494984d28039b16f4106) by [omegadarling](https://sketchfab.com/omegadarling?utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=share-popup&utm_content=57a91c516c94494984d28039b16f4106) on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com?utm_medium=embed&utm_campaign=share-popup&utm_content=57a91c516c94494984d28039b16f4106)\n\n¬†[](#cmnt1)\n\n1.

Artmatr will fabricate 7 unique Nouns per the specifications over a 7-day period, fabricating one Noun each day.\n4.  Artmatr will livestream the fabrication process on Twitch and YouTube.\n5.  Throughout ¬†the creative process, Artmatr will document a short film ¬†highlighting the transition from digital to physical\n6.  Once fabrication is complete, Artmatr will hold an exhibition to display the artworks, exhibiting the digital Nouns side-by-side with the physical pieces.\n7.  Artmatr will collaborate with the Nouns community to generate buzz and bring the community together with the traditional art community.\n8.  Explore future options to enable Nouns community to fabricate physical art.\n\n* * *\n\nABOUT ARTMATR\n=============\n\nArtmatr‚Äôs journey began almost eight years ago, by our founder Ben Tritt, an artist who has spent his entire career searching for ways to integrate his love of painting with the digital world. Way before NFTs, Ben visualized a world where painting and digital tools went hand in hand to create unique pieces of art. His journey took him to MIT, where he started exploring different methods of translating digital art into physical pieces through robotics.![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/3919/s32WMc.jpg)\n\nEventually, these experiments led to several technological products, most notably sophisticated painting robots that can create unprecedented art across different mediums - oil painting, watercolors, airbrush as well as new approaches to digital printing. These capabilities lend themselves to an incredibly flexible fabrication platform that can both mimic artists‚Äô hands through brushstrokes, and create entirely new methods of painting, such as taking code and directly translating it into prints. The fabrication process is intensely creative, given the flexibility of the tools; one piece of art can take on many different forms through the choice of different mediums and variables within the mediums themselves.\n\nArtmatr has already worked with some of the world‚Äôs most influential artists, running the gamut of traditional artists such as [Jeff Koons](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.jeffkoons.com/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650908671&usg=AOvVaw2teZ565IDJwwpvUyTTFr6o), to newer digital artists like Beeple and Tyler Hobbs.\n\nOur vision is to allow digital artists and collectors to translate their works into beautiful, one-of-a-kind pieces of art that could be proudly displayed in any gallery. We are currently hard at work developing a software suite that will complement the hardware platform, and are partnering with leading manufacturers with the shared goal of democratizing the creation and sale of physical art.![](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/8170/8g0VQz.jpg)\n\nThe Artmatr Team:\n\nArtmatr was founded by Benjamin Tritt, the company's Chief Creative officer, who has been creating and teaching art for decades at places like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Musee D'Orsay in Paris, The National Gallery in London, and MIT, and has seen it as his life‚Äôs mission to seek ways to unite technology & art. Rafael Feitelberg, Artmatr‚Äôs CEO, served as an executive at Tech Fortune 500 companies and has a proven track record of building, scaling and selling startups in Silicon Valley. Rafael has had a lifelong passion for art and holds a B.A. in Art History.\n\nTogether, they have built a diverse team of engineers, business professionals, and artists, who share their vision for creating the industry standard for bridging between digital and physical art.\n\nArtmatr‚Äôs Investors:\n\n*   [Delphi Digital](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://delphidigital.io&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650910270&usg=AOvVaw3rt_SvbDLMzIq6fzpmzVuQ): Delphi Digital is the leading research organization for crypto assets. Their research is regarded as an industry standard by institutions and crypto-natives alike. Delphi‚Äôs Ventures arm invests in early-stage Web3 startups, protocols, and networks that strive to make crypto happen sooner. Additionally, Delphi Labs incubates and builds protocols and tooling for the DeFi ecosystem.\n\n‚ÄúWe are incredibly excited for the world to see the power of Artmatr‚Äôs automated fabrication technology. Artmatr unlocks a new medium for a generation of digitally native artists to express themselves in the physical realm. We believe there is no better collaboration than with Nouns DAO given their commitment to advancing crypto, art and technology.‚Äù\n\n*   [Metaversal Ventures](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.metaversal.gg/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1675271650910954&usg=AOvVaw1fxq3HSoosWRt1xTdPZyBR): Metaversal is a holding company focused on the NFT vertical spanning all stages of the market from large corporate brands to individual NFT artists. We deploy a differentiated strategy by investing in the next blue chip NFT assets, supporting NFT infrastructure build out, and acting as an incubator and venture studio to NFT creators. Metaversal partners with brands, creators, content holders, and IP owners to identify, execute, and underwrite evocative NFT projects. Backed by CoinFund, DCG, Galaxy and other leading investors, the Metaversal team is uniquely positioned to identify the requirements for success in the web3 ecosystem and remains platform and blockchain agnostic.\n\n* * *\n\nWHY THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN\n\n*   Spreading the Word: We believe this collaboration will help spread Nouns through a first of its kind event, bringing together thought leaders from the art world and web3 to celebrate a future where DAOs bring the digital and physical world together\n*   Increase Market Size: Our belief is that by providing a bridge between digital and physical art we can effectively increase the size of both markets. NFT owners will now be able to proudly display the art they own, while physical pieces can be brought on-chain and receive a stronger validation of their provenance\n*   Increase Nouns Prices: By pairing Nouns with beautiful physical pieces, we believe the sales price for each Noun will increase over the period of fabrication. In the past, taking digital pieces into the real world has resulted in 3-10X¬†increase in value for the artists\n*   Leadership: By being the first DAO to bring its assets to the physical world as real art, Nouns will establish itself as leading the charge in showcasing the flexibility of the NFT model and its many applications besides digital-only art\n*   Community-Building: Nouners will be able to to get together and celebrate the community, build relationships, increase the network effects of the DAO, and potentially bringing in new Nouners into the fold\n\n* * *\n\nGOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL\n\nThe following are our goals for this proposal, should it pass:\n\n*   The production of a physical event, exhibiting Nouns art IRL, drawing interest from the local art scene as well as digital enthusiasts and media coverage.\n*   Work with the Nouns community to promote and market this collaboration and ultimately increase sales prices of Nouns\n\n* * *\n\nTIMELINES\n\n*   February 6-March 18, 2023 - Marketing efforts begin, including press releases and videos on social media\n*   March 20, 2023 - Fabrication begins, livestream starts\n\n1.

      "content": "# House of Nouns v2: Public Good\n\n![Drafts Demo](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Drafts+Demo+Sped+Up+2.gif)\n![Ideas Demo](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Ideas+Demo+Sped+Up+2.gif)\n\n# TLDR \n*This is a revision of our previous House of Nouns proposal. Based on feedback from the community, we‚Äôve reduced the budget significantly, clarified our goals, provided product mockups, and answered open questions.*\n\ntl;dr: We‚Äôre asking for 190 ETH to fund 5 months of development for [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.wtf) v2. Our MVP has seen tremendous traction, growing 100% each month, and proving to be a critical piece of infrastructure for governance. Now, we‚Äôre looking to build the best-in-class pre-proposal client to kill Discourse, create a layer for generating Nounish ideas, open source our core infrastructure, and expand to all Nounish DAOs. This will return value to the DAO via better decisions, increased participation, powerful infrastructure that the community can build on, and proliferation of Nounish governance.\n\nWe believe that governance is THE bottleneck for Nouns‚Äô participation and ultimate success. And we‚Äôre here to fix that.\n\nClick here to view this proposal on House of Nouns.\n\n# Background\n[House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.wtf) was previously funded with 20 ETH through Prop House. Our mission is huge: fix Nouns Governance and empower its contributors.\n\nWe saw tremendous success in our basic MVP from October through December:\n- Discussion on House of Nouns that exists nowhere else\n- Usage (MAUs and pageviews) grew >100% month-over-month \n- Continual expressions of love and support from the community\n- A go-to client that streamlines governance and prop discussion\n\n![HON v1](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/HON+v1.png)\n![Prop Debate](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Prop+Debate.png)\n[(a debate on Proposal 202)](https://houseofnouns.wtf/proposals/202)\n\n# Deliverables\nOur MVP was just a small part of the vision for House of Nouns: a full suite of supercharged governance tools, for all Nounish DAOs, built on open source infrastructure that anyone can extend.\n\nHere are the key components we‚Äôll build into House of Nouns v2.\n\n**Pre-proposal client.** Discourse is starved of life, and HON v2 will streamline everything that happens before a proposal goes on-chain, saving energy and empowering contributors to do their best work.\n- Rich discussion layer for getting feedback on a draft \n- Inline commenting on specific parts of a draft\n- Templates and multiplayer editor for creating proposal drafts\n- Ability to revise and re-release versions of a draft (like ProductHunt, or this House of Nouns prop) \n- Imported data from Discourse for backwards compatibility\n- One click to promote to on-chain, or have a sponsor do it for you \n- *(Note: see demo at top of prop)*\n\n**Ideas client.** Aligning the DAO on what matters is essential; we want to help contributors know what the DAO is excited about.\n- Reddit-like platform for generating, voting on, and rewarding ideas at the earliest stage\n- Backwards compatibility and integration with Prop Lot API\n- *(Note: see demo at top of prop)* \n\n**Open-source infrastructure** to enable the next 100 governance clients. HON v2 will eliminate all barriers to building on Nouns governance, and improve decentralization. We don‚Äôt want to be the last great governance client; we want to be the first of many.\n- API for all governance data, discussion data, Nouner profiles, and more\n- SDK for easy integration of client components to other platforms\n- Frontend repository for House of Nouns website\n- Technical documentation to help new Nounish builders launch their governance apps\n\n**Public good for all Nounish DAOs.** The success of Nouns is directly correlated to the success of Nounish forks; HON v2 will proliferate Nounish governance and drive value back to Nouns through forks (beyond ones created through Nouns Builder, like Lil Nouns, SharkDAO, etc) and branding ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®.\n- See activity from all of your Nounish DAOs in one feed\n- Keep track of all urgent to-dos and notifications across DAOs\n- Full House of Nouns functionality for all future forks of Nouns\n- *(Note: We‚Äôve already been funded by Nouns Builder to support their DAOs. Extending to non-Nouns Builder forks is a minimal effort on our side, and neither of these integrations contribute heavily to this prop‚Äôs budget. However, we wanted to ensure that we committed to it explicitly here, because we do see it as an important public good to support a future ecosystem of diverse forks.)*\n\n**First-class integration with other Nounish tools.** HON v2 will be your single looking glass into the rabbit hole of Nounish governance.\n- Agora delegate profile data\n- heyanoun anonymous commenting\n- Federation DAO-to-DAO governance\n- Nouns Atlas search \n\n**New & improved core governance tooling.** You asked and we heard ‚Äî we‚Äôll be delivering a faster and improved experience on core proposal tooling. This includes an improved UI, much faster loading, notifications for new proposals, enhanced profiles, and other improvements.\n\n**Moving beyond.** We move quickly. While we don‚Äôt want to overpromise, we‚Äôre also excited to go above-and-beyond with **social media data indexing, contributor profiles, and a post-proposal client** once we ship our core objectives. These will provide richer context and data, more functionality for DAO alignment, and greater transparency for the community.\n\nMost of all, we want to make governance fun and easy instead of a chore.\n\n# Budget, team, and sustainability\nWe‚Äôre requesting **190 ETH for 5 months** for full-time development work from the team. After revising our proposal, we believe this is in line with standard service development costs seen in coming out to 9.5 ETH/developer/month.\n\nThis will be spearheaded by:\n- [dadkins](https://twitter.com/dadkins_): longtime crypto hacker\n- [Wojciech Kocjan](https://twitter.com/w_kocjan): frontend & design engineer\n- Jamal Hashim: ex-Amazon, blockchain engineer\n- John Cairns: longtime crypto builder, ex-Gemini\n\nFor the sake of transparency, House of Nouns is by Collective, which is a VC-backed company that has expertise in NFTs and community tooling (previously launched MomentRanks.com and grew community tooling to 50,000+ Flow blockchain users). That being said, we want to make sure this is a self-sustaining and fair investment for the DAO; as such, the end goals include open source infrastructure and self-sustainability for the product, and the budget reflects what we think is a fair pricing for development services.\n\nWe plan to offer bespoke upgrades to other DAOs similar to Red Hat‚Äôs monetization model, as well as charging hosting costs for larger communities.\n\nThese upgrades will be built into the broader platform and framework for all users. To reiterate, **Nouns will have permanent access to the product open-source base infrastructure from this proposal, and future upgrades for other DAOs will improve upon this base layer, meaning Nouns receives HON v2 and reaps the benefits of future compatible upgrades.**\n\n# Testimonies\n![Testimony 1](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/testimony1.png) \n![Testimony 2](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/testimony2.png)\n![Testimony 3](https://collectivexyz-public.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/testimony3.png)\n‚Ä¶and many more <3 ",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 222 - Nouns Treasury Management",
      "content": "# Nouns Treasury Management\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ilwdE5O.jpg)\n\n\n## Summary\n\nWe‚Äôre requesting **65ETH** from the DAO to implement:\n- Nouns Treasury Management (NTM - a decentralized yield bearing asset manager)\n- A completely revamped treasury page\n- A pilot program to generate more revenues from the treasury using NTM.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ea3wNXu.png)\n\n\n\n\n## Introduction\n\n**Our main goal is to ensure that NounsDAO is self-sufficient.** \n\nWe want to ensure NounsDAO is maximizing productivity of its assets to sustain long term funding of the operations that proliferate everything Nounish. While the treasury has been well capitalized thus far, we‚Äôve seen the Nouns auctions drop from an average price of ~80Œû ‚Üí ~30Œû. At the same time proposals have been increasing in scope and complexity, requiring more funding.\n\nFor the DAO to continue operations at its current scope and with its current vision, **we need to start putting more emphasis on treasury growth and self-sustainability.**\n\n\n\nThe recent stETH ([#217](https://nouns.wtf/vote/217)) proposal was well received by Nouns members, a great indicator that a majority of the members are interested in safely increasing the DAO‚Äôs available capital.\n\nAs of today, NounsDAO has ~5-10% of the treasury in Lido and it‚Äôs yielding ~18Œû per month or 215Œû annually (equivalent to ~7 auctions). This is a great first step to increasing the treasury without assuming too much risk onto the DAO, as Lido is one of the most trusted staking providers, managing billions of ETH.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9ov5I1Q.png)\n\nThe next logical step is to productionize the stETH in the treasury as well. We plan to do that by creating the **Nouns Treasury Management**.\n\n## The Team\n\nThis proposal is brought to you by 0xPiney.eth, ramenboy.eth, and pinkglasses.eth. Collectivey, we‚Äôre known as 1560 Studios. The sum of three Nouners united to produce Nounish infrastructure that will maximize DAO efficiency and potential.\n\n- Noun 575 (0xpiney.eth) - All things on-chain and smart contracts\n- Noun 576 (ramenboy.eth) - All things web + design\n- Noun 409 (pinkglasses.eth) - All things DeFi and Decentralized.\n\nWe are industry veterans who have worked in big tech and exchanges before diving into the web3 ecosystem exploring NFTs, DeFi, and DAO‚Äôs. Since the start of the year, we‚Äôve been working full-time to create all things Nounish and decentralized.\n\n\n## **Nouns Treasury Management (NTM)**\n\nNTM is a bespoke solution for NounsDAO that will manage a portion of the treasury and be completely governed by NounsDAO - a decentralized asset manager.\n\nStrategies can be created by absolutely anyone. Our aim is to create truly decentralized asset management infrastructure that can be used by anyone and everyone, with the approval from governance. We‚Äôd like to kick off NTM with a pilot program that‚Äôll serve as a foundation for future yielding strategies.\n\n\nFor the pilot program, we want to focus on creating yield from the current stETH sitting in the treasury. We want to focus on stETH for 2 main reasons:\n\n1. **stETH is not used for proposal funding, and ETH withdrawals have yet to be unlocked.** Even after Shanghai is merged, there will be withdrawal queues in order to convert the stETH to ETH. The DAO‚Äôs stETH will be ‚Äòsitting‚Äô in the treasury for the foreseeable future. This creates an opportunity for us to yield in the meantime.\n2. **The most battle tested protocols with huge TVL‚Äôs support stETH.** This allows us to generate yield using relatively low risk strategies.\n\nNTM is inspired by Yearn vaults which currently hold over $400M in AUM (and peaked at around $6B AUM). These contracts are extremely battle tested and a reference in the yield aggregator domain. NTM‚Äôs general architecture will look like this:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nyYNq3M.png)\n\n**The key contracts + terms:**\n\n*Preface: For security reasons, all contracts will be **audited** and non-upgradeable. No proxies anywhere.*\n\n`Vault`: A contract that stores 1 asset (ETH, stETH, USDC, etc). Vaults manage the assets by deploying them into various yield bearing strategies. All vaults will:\n\n- be ERC4626 compatible\n- have privileged access to NounsDAO\n- be withdrawable by NounsDAO at any point (pending governance vote).\n\n`Strategy`: A contract that implements a yield bearing strategy - eg. take stETH and LP it into Curve, and sell the Curve emissions daily into ETH. Vaults deposit assets into specific strategies; ergo, the DAO sets the desired strategies employed.\n\n`NounsVaultManager`: The NounsVaultManager creates vaults and manages the strategies and assets used within the vaults. The DAO will interact with the Vault Manager through the TransactionBuilder.  All these vaults are ERC4626 compliant and deposit/withdrawals will only be able to be accessed by the DAO (TransactionBuilder).\n\n`NounsStrategyFactory`: The factory that creates different strategies for assets.\n\n## Yield **Strategies for the Pilot Program**\n\nNTM is first and foremost a **platform** that is completely governed by the DAO. Any Nouns members is able to create a strategy for any existing vault and the DAO can vote to accept the strategy or not - a completely democratic and Nounish treasury manager.\n\nFor the pilot program, we have researched a few strategies taking into account yield + risk for the treasury. While there are a wide range of possible strategies that take into account different models for analyzing risk/reward, we see these first two strategies as being ideal for the pilot program of NTM.\n\n1. **LP stETH <> ETH into Curve.** Today, 90%+ of stETH <> ETH swaps go through Curve. By LP‚Äôing into Curve, we‚Äôd get returns from supplying this market.\n    - **Yield:** Low to Medium (~2.5% APY currently with $LDO emissions). ~125ETH ($200K USD) yield in 1 year with our stETH in treasury.\n    - **Risk:** Low.\n        - There exists two main risks with this strategy:\n            1. stETH depegs. We‚Äôve seen stETH deviate away from ETH so this is a potential risk the DAO would assume. stETH and ETH are expected to trade closer to - if not exactly 1:1 once Shanghai is deployed, since stETH will be directly redeemable. \n            2. Curve gets exploited. We see a minimal risk of this due to the time these contracts have been deployed on-chain, and the audits performed on them.\n\n    If the peg diverges by a significant amount, we may see a different amount of stETH to ETH in our LP position. Past attempts from external actors to destabilize stETH in the past resulted in the peg converging to a 1:1 ratio regardless, with interesting returns for the LP‚Äôs.\n\n    When exiting or entering said strategy we would pledge both assets in order to minimize negative slippage (pledging ETH <-> stETH instead of just stETH).\n\n    **Strategy #1 Summary:** Interest generated by this strategy could (at current APY) help fund the cost of grants at a rate of 10 ETH/month, while exposing the DAO to minimal risk by using a trusted protocol with already $5B in TVL.\n        \n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/RwkzZm0.png)\n        \n2. **LP stETH <> ETH into Balancer and stake into Aura Finance.** Balancer is a popular DEX and Aura Finance is similar to what Convex is to Curve (governance and emissions from Balancer).\n    - **Yield:** High (~8-10% APY currently with $AURA and $BAL emissions). 400 ETH (600K USD) in 1 year.\n    - **Risk:** Low\n        - There are three main risks associated with this strategy:\n            1. stETH depegs. See above.\n            2. Balancer gets exploited: Same reason as Curve above - battle tested DEX + has been operating with hundreds of millions in TVL. \n            - Aura gets exploited: Aura has had extensive audits done to its contracts, works closely with Balancer, does continuous code reviews, and holds $450M+ in TVL.\n        \n    Similar to Strategy #2, we‚Äôd be earning additional yield by depositing into a second order protocol. Based on the amount in TVL and the similarity of the smart contracts with Convex, the risk profile is very similar.\n        \n    We would, however, need to sell (harvest) 3 separate tokens. This would potentially increases the gas costs of this strategy, but the rewards being ~3x the Curve strategy would cover any increase in transaction fees.\n        \n    **Strategy #2 Summary:** With this strategy we could generate 32 ETH per month. This would be enough to fund the Nouns Prop House in its current form without any drains on the treasury.\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/UBWLngv.png)\n        \n## Timeline + Ask\n\nWe believe implementing these two strategies will be the most fruitful for the pilot program based on risk <> reward. We estimate it will take ~1 month for the implementation of NTM, auditing of contracts, and implementing the new treasury page.\n\nWe are asking for **65ETH** from NounsDAO to implement the above, with an additional **100 ETH + 100 stETH** that would be used to pilot this project (with future expectations to allocate more capital to NTM if the results are favorable). These pilot funds will first be sent to a multi-sig with trusted Nouns members (see below), until the NTM contracts have been audited and deployed.\n\nThe funds will go towards:\n\n- **Contract audit** (30 ETH for C4 audit).\n- ~11 ETH each (3 members) to get this version of NTM into production (implementation + audits) + treasury page. We estimate this will take ~1 month.\n\nFollowing the launch of the pilot program, we‚Äôd be requesting:\n\n- 50% of all yields (**no principal**) will go to 1560 studios until we hit **175 ETH.**\n- After we hit 175 ETH, we would take a 2% management fee on further generated yield (no principal).\n\nTo emphasize, we want to profit alongside the DAO, in order to properly align incentives. Rather than making a large ask and risk t, we‚Äôd prefer to win if our output is legitimate and positive-sum.\n\nWe‚Äôre excited about the idea of working on this, and we hope to deliver a treasury that‚Äôs more capital efficient and less dependent on primary sales for funding. **This proposal is the first step in NounsDAO becoming 100% fully self-sustaining.**\n\n## Looking Ahead\n\n1. If the pilot program proves to be profitable and well-received, we will submit another proposal to allocate more stETh to NTM for the current strategies.\n\n2. The team will continue maintaining NTM and researching new strategies alongside Nouners.\n    - We will be actively taking feedback and working with any Nouners that are interested in developing strategies.\n    - A low hanging fruit could be to create a strategy to productionize our lil nouns by LPing them into Sudoswap.\n    - Design and UX is a huge focus for us so we will be constantly improving NTM and the treasury page.\n\n3. Following the initial development of NTM, we want to generalize it as a service (we've acquired [ntm.wtf](http://ntm.wtf) as the domain) for every on-chain treasury. We're going to be actively listening to feedback and speaking with Nouns members about how to build this in a way that properly benefits Nouners and the DAO itself. \n    - Prophouse like plug and play service for other treasuries to generate yield using NTM.\n    - Potential kickbacks back to the DAO for every new DAO integration.\n    - Push NTM to be premier on-chain treasury management service for all DAOs.\n    - To foster conversations about self sustainability, we will be sharing frequent updates of new developments and ideas. \n\n4. Our team is dedicated to building infrastructure and tools that proliferates all things Nounish. Stay tuned!\n\n## Proposed Transaction Description\n\nWe'd be sending:\n- 65 ETH to our team wallet (0x79f08F2e75A8C99428DE4A2e6456c07C99E55da5) to cover audit and development costs.\n- 100 ETH + 100 stETH for the pilot program to a 5/5 multisig (0xF4B99Bfb0500c6b1141DF1E0B7ED86c6e19B0ca6) with the following owners:\n    - 0xpiney.eth\n    - ramenboy.eth\n    - pinkglasses.eth\n    - El4d.eth (Verbs team)\n    - Yitong.eth (Agora core member)\n\nThe funds for the pilot program will be sent to NTM as soons as audits are done and contracts are deployed.",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 219 - Proliferate ‚Äì Measure ‚Äì Repeat",
      "content": "# Proliferate ‚Äì Measure ‚Äì Repeat\n\n## TL;DR\n- We propose a Prop House round where builders will submit a proposal that includes their own unique metric for measuring Nounish impact.\n- The proposed round is different from Open Rounds as it asks builders to bring their own proposal, embed their own metrics, argue its importance and overall impact of their proposal all in one submission.\n- Lil Data Pod will provide post-event analysis and findings to identify the most effective data driven approaches from builders, which can lead to better Prop House rounds in the future.\n- The goal is to help discover the many nuances in the kind of metrics used in measuring proliferation by giving builders freedom to add their own metrics and argue its usefulness within the scope of their proposal, enabling voters to gauge impact before voting.\n\n## Rationale\nThere is impact, then there is Nounish Impact.\nMeasuring proliferation has been discussed for quite sometime. From builders‚Äô perspective, we observe measuring proliferation using established methods is difficult potentially caused by the elusive quality of subjective, qualitative impact of proliferation efforts. Giving builders the autonomy to pick their own metrics for measuring their proliferation efforts, and encouraging them to argue its importance in measuring overall Nounish impact of what they do will give voters, participants, as well as builders a glimpse into possibilities in measuring Nounish Impact.\nWe propose a Prop House round where builders will be asked to submit a proposal that includes their own unique metric for measuring Nounish impact.\n\n## How is it different from Open Rounds?\nOpen Rounds asks proposers to write and submit proposals. This gives way for voters to make decisions based on *perceived* impact, not *******measured/measurable******* impact. \n\nThe proposed round asks builders to include their own metrics in their proposals, argue its importance, and the overall impact of their proposal ‚Äî all in one submission. In addition, builders can use [this template](https://www.notion.so/BYOM-Template-6f3247f814df49ef99904f8e79c688b6) to write their proposal.\n\n## Specification\n- a 4 x 7.5 ETH Nouns Prop House round\n- builders can use [this template](https://al409.notion.site/BYOM-Template-6f3247f814df49ef99904f8e79c688b6) to write and submit their proposal.\n- Metrics to include in the proposal\n    - Although it will be up to the builder‚Äôs discretion to choose which metric(s) to choose for their proposal, here are a few examples:\n        - Twitter Spaces stats,\n        - Number of smiles,\n        - Tweet views,\n        - TikTok views,\n        - YouTube views,\n        - Foot traffic,\n        - Number of hugs,\n        - QR code scans,\n        - Web analytics,\n        - Qualitative data,\n        - Sales,\n        - Number of attendees / participants,\n        - App downloads, etc.\n\n## Budget\n\n**TOTAL = 34 ETH**\n\n- 30 ETH - 4 x 7.5 ETH Mandated Prop House round\n- 4 ETH - for administrating the round. admin scope:\n    - marketing the round via Noun Square and community Twitter accounts, onboarding builders from different communities, liaising with Prop House team\n    - delivering findings to identify the most effective data driven approaches;\n    - data pod will also document and categorize the data on NounsMetrics to use for future round quantification and documentation. Ideal outcome, is a model or useful record ‚Äì a usable framework that will inform future builders and voters. Consequently enhancing the allocation of Nouns DAO's treasury.\n    - interviewing winners about their proposals and contribution. The interview:\n        - provides insight as to which proposals have high impact\n        - the thought process behind the builder's proposal creation process\n        - provides more exposure of the builder through multimedia distribution\n- funds are transferred to a 2/3 multisig. Signers are Lil Nouners: [bk](https://twitter.com/0xbk_), [mfrs](https://twitter.com/mfrs_manuel), and [brook](https://twitter.com/0x1092).\n\n## Timeline\n\n- Prop House submission: 4 weeks\n- Prop House voting: 2 weeks",

This has included all development of concepts, code, community and forking the Nouns DAO protocol.\n\nWe‚Äôve partnered with [Rusutsu Resort](https://rusutsu.com/en/), 4 time winner of Best Ski Resort in Japan. The resort accommodates in excess of 3,000 guests per day across 1000+ hotel rooms attracting 400,000+ overnight stays and 1,100,000+ million day visitors per year with a mix of 60% local and 40% foreign visitation. The resort also hosts events like the [G1 Summit](https://g1summit.com/en/) where the attendees represent entrepreneurs and next generation leaders from Japan.\n\nThaSwami holds a senior management position within the company that owns Rusutsu Resort, enabling preferential advertising rates and enhancing a cooperative relationship with the resort.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4D4R9mp.jpg)\n\n* +2,000 hectares across 3 Mountains\n* 14 Ski Lifts and 4 Gondolas accessing 37 Ski Runs\n* Hokkaido‚Äôs Largest Theme Park with 60 Attractions\n* 72 Holes across 4 Golf Courses\n* 3,000,000 Person Catchment\n* 39,000 Vehicles Per Day\n* 2,300 Capacity across 14 Conference Facilities\n* +1,000 Hotel Rooms\n* 20 Food & Beverage Outlets\n* 15 Retail Stores\n\n---\n\n# Nounify Hokkaido's Largest All-Season Resort\n\nWe‚Äôll create bilingual visual awareness, call to action signage, branding sponsorship throughout the resort, physical structures for long lasting film opportunities, activities to engage resort guests, social media presence on multiple platforms and provide educational materials about Nouns DAO.\n\n### **Take a look at the scale of this activation!**\n![Resort Activation Map](https://i.ibb.co/tbd0XM5/Prop-Activation-Animation.gif)\n*Resort Activation Map* ‚òùÔ∏è\n\n## Some of the things we‚Äôve lined up:\n\n‚åê‚óß-‚óß **Thousands of noggles distributed for free across the resort**\nNoggles handed out en masse to really get the attention of guests and encourage social sharing with strategic hashtags.\n\n‚åê‚óß-‚óß **Resort Socials takeover**\nPeriodic takeover of the official Rusutsu Resort social media feeds (Instagram 22k followers, Facebook 37k followers, Twitter 14k followers).\n\n‚åê‚óß-‚óß **Posters in 247 gondolas**\n60 x 16cm posters will capture undivided attention with an average 9 minute travel time per gondola trip, 6,000 person carrying capacity per hour, and operating daily from 9am-4pm.\n\n![Gondola Signage - 60x16cm](https://i.imgur.com/XQAeNbl.jpg)\n\n‚åê‚óß-‚óß **Signage at 3 gondola stations**\n168 x 119cm signs at gondola station lift lines provide large format visuals to skiers and snowboarders before riding gondolas, creating a call to action pre-gondola rides.\n\n‚åê‚óß-‚óß **Signage at 2 on-mountain restaurants**\nSignage at 2 on-mountain restaurants with a capacity of 750+ seats will be visible for the entire winter season. On-mountain restaurants represent 60% of the resort‚Äôs daytime food and beverage activity and are patronised by almost every person on the mountain.\n\n![On-Mountain Restaurant Example](https://i.imgur.com/Uqi7Sws.jpg)\n\n‚åê‚óß-‚óß **Terrain park naming, branding and feature**\n* Renaming of the terrain park to Nouns Terrain Park that will appear on digital trail maps and the resort website.\n* Custom banners planted strategically near rails, boxes and jumps to maximise photo and video opportunities.\n* Custom built nounish terrain park feature similar to what was created in Rio de Janeiro will also be produced and installed at the resort.\n* Potential for permanent installation beyond the proposed 15 months.\n\n![Terrain Park Banners](https://i.imgur.com/tVolISx.png)\n\n![Terrain Park Feature](https://i.imgur.com/u8G1nQ7.png)\n\n‚åê‚óß-‚óß **Pop-up dioramas in-resort**\n* Locations within the resort will allow for pop-up dioramas, backdrops and life-size cutouts, similar to Nouns Fair at ETH SF ([Prop 162](https://nouns.wtf/vote/162)) and NFT Fest Australia ([Prop 164](https://nouns.wtf/vote/164)).\n* Pop-ups will include call to actions to take selfies and photos of eachother post photos on social media, using hashtags as well as QR codes and website links to track metrics.\n\n![Pop-up Diorama Example](https://i.imgur.com/JoYk2Nd.png)\n\n‚åê‚óß-‚óß **POAP pull-up banner**\nBanner installed in high traffic area of resort for POAP claims.\n\n![POAP Pull Up Banner](https://i.imgur.com/LixgYhs.png)\n\n‚åê‚óß-‚óß **POAP treasure hunt**\n* Wallet and POAP onboarding website guide.\n* 20 NFC/QRcode activation touch-points in-resort and on-mountain.\n* Prizes for completing a full POAP collection.\n* Ongoing engagement through holders of the collected POAPS.\n* Onboarding opportunities, introducing people to the technology, Nouns DAO and community artists.\n\n![POAP Treasure Hunt](https://i.imgur.com/2epJBYe.gif)\n\n---\n\n# Why The Alpine Subculture?\n\n* Typically snow sports attracts a predominantly wealthy demographic which leads us to believe the onboarding potential is immense.\n* The art, the technology and the community are culturally relevant to alpine enthusiasts.\n* There is a huge global audience of 135 million skiers/snowboarders worldwide and 2,000 ski resorts across 68 countries.\n* The scalability of proliferation spans the globe.\n* It‚Äôs an untapped market in terms of bringing Nouns DAO, NFTs and crypto in general into the lifestyle.\n* The alpine enthusiast subculture is super passionate about their lifestyle which brings value to proliferation. People share their story with friends, family and online. Nouns can be a big part of that story.\n* User generated content is a powerful flywheel where a large subset of the culture films everything they do.\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/xf5FglA.jpg)\n\n# Why Japan?\n\n- Nouns has a strong and growing following in Japan with Nouns DAO Japan (+3,000 Twitter followers and +4,000 discord members) and is the only foreign language currently translated on nouns.wtf.\n- Japanese culture resonates with the Nouns artwork.\n- It is predicted that the NFT industry in Japan will grow significantly through 2028, with an anticipated compound annual growth rate of¬†38.7% from 2022 to 2028 ([source](https://blockzeit.com/japans-nft-market-on-the-rise-expected-to-reach-1-36-billion-in-2022/)).\n- The Japanese government is supportive of the technology, having awarded NFTs to 7 mayors for their achievements in using digital technology to solve issues and announcing NFT and Metaverse expansion ([source](https://forkast.news/headlines/japan-pm-nft-metaverse-expansion/)).\n- ‚ÄúNouns DAO‚Äù receives the [most interest globally on Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=nouns%20dao) from Japan.\n- Hokkaido, Japan is known as the powder mecca of the world.\n\n---\n\n# Expression Sessions\n\nWe‚Äôll organise expression sessions to onboard the alpine and snowsports sub-culture to the Nouns ecosystem through community engagement. Both local guests and professionals will be invited to have fun and showcase their skills on the mountain while wearing nounish gear provided and/or riding nounish features.\n\nIn the spirit of being nounish, we‚Äôll hold engaging contests and offer prizes throughout the expression sessions for fun and creative categories. We‚Äôll also educate on the potential of sponsorship via proposals through Gnars DAO and Alps DAO.\n\nWe will encourage people to capture photos and film of the activities that can then be added to a CC0 repository and shared on social media with strategic hashtags.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Cm8kTd1.png)\n\n---\n\n# CC0 Media Repository\n\nCapturing this nounish alpine resort takeover with world class skiers and snowboarders in the heart of northern Japan will not only proliferate the Nouns brand in Japan, but allow us to start building a CC0 media repository that demonstrates this subculture to the world.\n\nBy creating this repository and encouraging the use of the media, it will spin up an incredibly rich nounish content generation flywheel. This has the potential to reach the rest of the world, resonating with the global ski and snowboard community totalling 135 million people.\n\nWe will also have independent filmers and photographers on mountain to capture many of the nounish moments and activities throughout the season.\n\nDuring their time in Hokkaido they will be documenting attendee activities, the proliferation of Nouns at Rusutsu Resort and throughout the local community, athletes and local talent, and all things culturally unique to Japan.\n\nAnyone in the world will able to cut together footage from the repository, all featuring the iconic noggles and create their own films and promos. Imagine the following video at Rusutsu Resort, but nounish.\n\n[![Rusutsu](https://i.imgur.com/Ax9Xj20.jpg)\n](https://youtu.be/RgTjl4_h4Kg)[https://youtu.be/RgTjl4_h4Kg](https://youtu.be/RgTjl4_h4Kg)\n\n---\n\n# Measuring Success\n\nAnalytics over the activation period will be captured through a variety of touch points and made available to the community. These include:\n\n- QR code scans - posters and signage will contain QR codes leading to a landing page with further directions to project specific websites, enabling more granular data on customer click throughs.\n- POAP claims - the gamified POAP treasure hunt will deliver data on the number of participants throughout the activation period based on POAP claims. Additionally, further engagement with holders can also be measured.\n- Resort visitor numbers - general branding awareness will be measured by data from the resort with respect to hotel guest numbers and daily visitation statistics.\n- Analytics on media content produced and strategic hashtags used.\n- Physical items distributed.\n- In-resort onboarding can be measured via verifying POAP claims from Rusutsu Resort along with nounish NFTs in a token gated channel in the Alps DAO Discord.\n- Media repo usage stats and attribution where available from further created content.\n- Hashtags - posts using strategic hashtags.\n- Engagement during resort social takeovers.\n- Number of people engaged in expression sessions.\n\n---\n\n# Timeline\n\nExpression sessions and POAP ‚ÄúTreasure Hunts‚Äù will be pop-up by nature and held multiple times throughout the 15 month engagement, as will the resort socials takeovers.\n\nThere will be ongoing marketing engagement throughout the resort the entire time as well.\n\nThe following key elements will take place on this timeline:\n\n### Q1 2023\n\nProposal process, begin engagements at resort, artwork and asset creation, installation of posters, signage and banners, terrain park branding online, design physical nounish feature/structure.\n\n### Q2 2023\n\nCC0 Media Repository build, nounish physical feature/structure build.\n\n### Q3 2023\n\nCC0 Media Repository launch and proliferation, engage with film makers to make nounish content using the media collected, nounish feature/structure Summer installation.\n\n### Q4 2023\n\nFurther artwork and asset creation, terrain park branding both online and in print, nounish feature/structure Winter installation.\n\n### Q1-Q2 2024\n\nOrganised film session with nounish feature/structure, compile and present the results and effectiveness of the activation.\n\n---\n\n# Funding Breakdown\n\n* Nounifying the Resort: $109k USD which equates to less than $248 per day for the entire 15 month activation.\n* Expression Session Activations: $24k USD.\n* Content creation by independent film/photo crew and editing: $15k USD.\n* Team/Staff Compensation & Operations: $50k USD.\n\nTotal Funding Request: $198k USD\n\n**Detailed breakdown:**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/k33Cd3t.png)\n\n---\n\n# Who We Are\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0S9V9B0.png)\n\n### Benbodhi\n\nI‚Äôve been a dev for over a decade and have created software that over 1 million websites are actively using.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 216 - Mandated Round: Private Voting Research Sprint",
      "content": "# Mandated Round: Private Voting Research Sprint\n\n## TLDR\n\n* What is this?\n    * 3 months, 3 zero-knowledge teams, funded by Nouns to design open source solutions for private voting.\n    * All outputs are open source, and include detailed designs and proofs of concept.\n    * 70K USDC per team + 20K USDC marketing budget to appear on zk pods and newsletters. Total: 230K USDC.\n* Why should we do this?\n    * Take a huge leap closer to having private voting working on mainnet.\n    * Create valuable public goods in the form of the expected open source private voting designs.\n    * Attract gigabrain builders in crytography/zk to Nouns.\n    \n\n## On Private Voting\n\nThere has been a surge of interest among Nouners to experiment with private voting. \n\nThe main benefit is freeing voters from biases and pressures. Voters don't have to fear the social costs of voting opposite of what their peers might expect. Furthermore, influential voters by default don't show their vote (they can still choose to share their vote), making it harder for others to copy their behavior, nudging more voters to develop original points of view.\n\nThe main concern is that private voting removes reputation cost, potentially leading to riskier voter behaviors. Furthermore, if the tally of votes is only known at the end of the voting period, it may increase voter apathy and lead to outcomes opposite the majority's preference.\n\nWe think the benefits are very valuable to Nouns and DAOs generally, meriting further exploration.\n\n## Goals\n\nAfter several conversations with zero-knowledge folks, including the awesome [Personae Labs](https://personaelabs.org/) (HeyAnoun), the conculsion is clear: **there are no obvious solutions to private voting. Further research is required.**\n\nAll the designs that have been suggested to us so far come with significant drawbacks; examples include requiring a central trusted party, requiring Nouners to pool their Nouns in a central contract, requiring a registration step before each proposal, linking Nouner balances to their votes, and a few more.\n\nWe are still a long way away from deciding if Nouns should use private voting and in what ways.\n\nThis round's goal is to better inform us on possibilities and limitations, such that in a few months we'll be able to decide if and how to experiment with private voting. By funding this research we're making private voting more attaintale for Nouns and other DAOs.\n\nShould the DAO choose to continue down this path, we expect to have strong noun-pilled zk teams to help us get there.\n\n**Important to highlight: funding this round does not mean a decision to go all-in on private voting; it means we're interested enough in the possibilities for Nouns and other DAOs to take this single step forward.**\n\nSee the [full round spec](https://hackmd.io/SVyDLBq7QSWNl0LaYIuqHA?view) and the [pending prop house round](https://prop.house/nouns/private-voting-research-sprint) for a deeper dive.\n\n\n## Operations\n\n* One month for teams to apply.\n* 2.5 weeks for Nouners to vote; we want to make sure there's enough time to properly make sense of all applications.\n* Up to 3 teams get funded. Teams must pass a quorum of 300 prop house votes (30 Nouns) and be in the top 3 to win.\n* Funded teams perform ~3 months of research, supported by the verbs team and the tech pod.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n* We will hopefully have a variety of approaches to private voting designs that work well with Nouns DAO on Ethereum mainnet.\n* We will understand tradeoffs within specific designs and across designs.\n* We will hopefully have a few working proofs-of-concept that can accelerate any implementation we may decide on.\n* All of the above will be open source, for the benefit of Nouns and the entire crypto community.\n\n\n### Safe\n\nFunds are managed in a [3/5 Gnosis Safe](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x44848E3854b23d924712F4a3C4b19E6D111F7639/home) managed by Elad, David, Solimander, Vapeape and Will.\n\n## Marketing\n\nWe will activate the Nouns community to help raise awareness among all the zk gigabrains out there.\n\nBeyond twitter, we would like to raise awareness through popular zk podcasts and newsletters.\n\nTo enable these marketing efforts we're asking for an additional budget of 20K USDC.\n\n## Budget\n\n* Mandated round: 210K USDC (3 teams * 70K USDC).\n* Marketing: 20K USDC.\n* Total: 230K USDC.\n\nThe budget might not be fully utilized, because we didn't fund 3 teams, or because we didn't need the full marketing budget. Any remaining funds will be sent back to the DAO once the round is done.\n\n## Why should we care?\n\nNouns DAO is one of the most interesting corners on the internet right now, and it has a lot to do with our continuous iterations on protocols and tools. Let's continue being the first to do many things.\n\nLet's be the first DAO to experiment with fully private voting on mainnet. Let's pave the path for other DAOs, and let's show everyone that we're on the frontier, that we're pulling the future faster towards us.\n\nWe will attract brilliant people through this round, who might get totally noun-pilled and accelerate us ever further. This round is a great reason for all of us to make a lot of noise and get Nouns a spike of attention.\n\nThis round will grow the set of people at the intersection of (a) caring about the future of crypto and (b) loving Nouns.\n\n## People behind this proposal\n\nHuge thanks to [Noun 40](https://twitter.com/noun40__) for sparking this round and providing tons of ideas, feedback and support.\n\nHuge thanks to [Lakshman](https://twitter.com/lakshmansankar) and [DigitalOil](https://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil); with their detailed inputs the round spec looks so much better.\n\nThank you [Seneca](https://twitter.com/cryptoseneca) for the feedback and all the prop house support in making this special round work well.\n\nWe're grateful for the tech pod's support of this proposal and anything else we do, namely [Solimander](https://twitter.com/_solimander_), [Vapeape](https://twitter.com/punk4464) and [Will](https://twitter.com/will__price).\n\nWe are the verbs team, [David](https://twitter.com/davidbrai) and [Elad](https://twitter.com/eladmallel), working full time on the Nouns protocol.\n\n‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®",

      "content": "# Uplink.wtf - a marketing platform for all ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\n# TLDR\n\nFund the Calabara team with 50 ETH to build uplink.wtf -- a marketing and proliferation platform for Nouns. \n\nClick on the video below to get a short summary of what we are building!\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/WCJ7iBK.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRSPx_yvAI4)\n*click me for a video summary*\n\n# Uplink ... WTF?\n\nIn wireless communications, \"uplink\" refers to transmissions originating from user devices. For Nouns, it's a mechanism for communities to create decentralized marketing campaigns, utilizing token-gated Twitter contests to proliferate both user-generated and DAO-funded content. \n\n\nTwitter + Ethereum is our secret sauce. After experimenting with contests for 6 months, we are now ready to take the project to the next level. We will build uplink.wtf, a unified nounish platform with modules for both a refactored **Creator Contest** experience and a brand new **Nouns Raffle** application.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dO10FiJ.png)\n\n\n\n# Use Cases\n\nUplink has two main use cases, each taking a unique approach to planning, content creation, and distribution.\n\n# Use case 1: NounsDAO\n\n## The problem\nWith a proven track record of funding high-quality content initiatives such as the Ordinary Folk video, Nounish productions, and more, NounsDAO boasts a diverse portfolio of content ready for widespread distribution. The challenge now lies in finding innovative ways to expand our reach and connect with a wider audience.\n\n\n## Module 1: Nouns Raffle\nNouns Raffle is a new mechanism for targeted external distribution. We're flipping the script on the traditional curation contest model, allowing the DAO to incentivize influential token holders to proliferate nouns in exchange for raffle entrance. Only holders of pre-configured tokens who share specific nounish content on Twitter are eligible for the draw. \n\n\n**Example A**\nNounsDAO puts up 10 ETH to proliferate the Oridinary Folk video. To enter the raffle, entrants must\n1) Share the video on Twitter\n2) Hold a punk, ape, noun, or something else preconfigured by the DAO.\n\nOnce a participant verifies proof of wallet and account ownership, they are officially counted as an entrant. When the contest ends, 1 entrant is randomly selected and the 10 ETH is distributed to their wallet.\n\n**Example B**\nThe Nouns video contest team is currently posting 25 ETH to create a decentralized marketing team - asking proposers to explain how they will get people to enter the main $200k video contest. Imagine if instead, the organizers created a short explainer video and raffled 10 ETH to a random punk holder that shared it on twitter.\n\nRemember that foobar tweet about getting ETH to market for Nouns? It turns out it's not such a crazy idea. This model allows NounsDAO to achieve mass proliferation *outside* of the ecosystem, and creates incentives for influential token holders to extract additional utility out of their NFT's. Just imagine the memes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V0LUIZq.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Lcei0dH.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IsTR8OS.png)\n\n\n## Proliferation machine\n\n\nThe raffle landing page can also double as a valuable ad space for the Nouns -- linking back to nouns.wtf, Prop House, or other relevant projects, with the goal of increasing visibility for other activities of the DAO and encouraging influential token holders to further explore Nouns while they're here. The raffle landing page is a great opportunity to cross-promote and increase the reach of the DAO's other projects. If we really wanted to get crazy, we could even render the current auctions.\n\n\n## Implementation details\n1. We'll host a vote for Nouners to decide:\n    * What they want to proliferate.\n    * Who they want to proliferate it.\n        * As an example, Nouners could decide that they want punk, ape, and noun holders to proliferate a video produced by the Nounish team.\n2. We'll come back on-chain with a prop requesting 10 ETH to host the first Nouns raffle.\n2. We'll open the raffle for submissions.\n3. When the raffle ends, we'll send a transaction with all verified entrants to a contract using Chainlink VRF to verifiably choose a random winner.\n    * Our goal is to demonstrate a social proof-of-concept for this marketing experiment. The neccessary features for a permissionless implementation involve quite complex technical considerations (*some alpha in \"Beyond\" section*). For now, this is how we'll handle the random selection.\n\nOf course, we'll make sure we are complying with Twitters rules and guidelines for paid promotions, as well as taking preventative measures to ensure the system is not gamable / botable.\n\n# Use case 2: Nouns ecosystem projects\n\n## The problem\nTwitter contests are an effective means for nounish projects to spread their meme, attract new creatives, and generate novel interest. They can be utilized to align the incentives of a given project and contributors towards driving both creation and distribution. In other words, they are an excellent marketing and proliferation tool. The Noun Square has had great success with this model, so why don‚Äôt more projects follow suit?\n\nTwitter contests are an administrative nightmare. The process of fetching submissions, importing them to a judging platform, collecting wallet addresses, and handling payouts can involve up to 3 hours of total admin overhead.\n\n## Module 2: Creator contests\nThrough Creator Contests, projects can launch open-source marketing campaigns, incentivizing both new and existing community artists, storytellers, and other creatives to proliferate the meme on Twitter.\n\n\nIn this system, community operators launch a contest which triggers an automatic announcment tweet from their twitter account. This tweet serves as an invitation for creatives to craft content and potentially win the ETH or ERC tokens being auctioned following a token-gated community vote. Creatives submit by quote tweeting the announcement tweet with their submission, helping spread the word about the project through their nounish creations.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cDWuZ26.gif)\n\n\n\n\nContests are designed to be completely configurable, with flexible options for rewards, submission and voting requirements, voting strategies, and more - allowing projects to experiment with different incentive systems and implementations that align with their unique goals. Here are some of the ways Twitter contests could be utilized for different projects:\n\n**AI pod** - onboard new artists and creative thinkers to AI and show off their latest and greatest models.\n\n**Composables** - recently hosted a contest in which they observed 30+ new collections and 1000+ new traits uploaded to their platform and shared on twitter.\n\n**Esports** - host \"best-clip\" tournaments or open-source the creation of nounish gaming heads.\n\n**SharkDAO** - source and vote on community art pieces to mint as open-editions from the DAO.\n\n**Gnars** - \"Skate Your City Series\". Worldwide digital skate competitions hosted by Gnars, run on Creator Contests, judged by GnarsDAO.\n\n**Builder DAO projects** - run contests to help the community find their meme.\n\nFor nounish projects and pods, creating and distributing ***their own*** meme is critical for the path to sustainability, attracting new creatives, growing the brand, and deploying cool s**t. Creator Contests are the final piece in allowing projects to implement a microcosm of the virtuous cycle.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/v58MHXd.png)\n\n\n# Status\n\nCreator contests exist today. Nouns Raffle does not. We launched creator contests in September, and have since helped groups like TNS, Composables, SharkDAO, and others generate almost 600 submissions  and award over 8 ETH + 25k ERC20 tokens to proliferators. SharkDAO and NSFW both awarded us small grants to build the underlying infrastructure.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wC3iOzC.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FytICws.png)\n\n\n# The ask\n\nWe're requesting 50 ETH to fund a 3 month development cycle to deploy Creator Contests v2 and a brand new Nouns Raffle application to the new uplink.wtf platform.\n\n\n# Roadmap\n\nOver the 3 months, we will work in a rapid development cycle that can be split into 3 main phases. As always, everything will be open-source.\n\n## Phase 1: Escape velocity (8 weeks)\n\nIn phase 1, we'll be focused on optimizing and extending our existing stack, deploying Creator Contests v2 to the new platform, and laying the foundation for phase 2.\n\n* Week 1-6: Nuts & Bolts.\n    * The focus of this phase is to address various technical challenges related to our MVP Twitter services and other critical infrastructure, with the goal of re-designing a more efficient, scalable, and reliable infra and deploying it to the new platform. This work is critical for matching current demand and supporting the vision for the next phase of the project. Our applications real-time requirements are a simple example of this. The MVP implementation is only able to handle 5 concurrent real-time instances (contests), which we've already exceeded multiple times.\n* Week 7: Support native video and other creative formats.\n* Week 8: Deploy version 1.0.\n* Week 9: Add social impression graphs and support voting for token delegates.\n    * Will be key for measuring success transparently and tracking real-time engagement data for campaigns.\n* Week 1-9: UI/UX redesign.\n    * UI: uplink.wtf will be a totally nounish implementation, with new logos, fonts, layouts and more.\n    * UX: We've compiled a laundry list of improvements that we're ready to implement to create the best user experience and offer more features for operators. This will be a continuous WIP and won't be a blocker for phase 2.\n\n\n## Phase 2: Nouns Raffle (3 weeks)\nWith most of the heavy lifting taken care of in the first phase, we'll be able to stand the Nouns Raffle module up fairly quickly.\n\n* Week 10-11: Development of Nouns Raffle app.\n* Week 12: Nouner vote.\n* Week 13: Deploy version 2.0. On-chain prop to fund the first raffle.\n* Week 14: Host Nouns Raffle #1.\n\n## Phase 3: Wrapping up\n* Week 15: Open access to API and add vote audit reports.\n\n# Defining Success\n\nFollowing the deployment of version 1.0 (Creator Contests - week 8), we'll be targeting the following KPI's over a 3 month period:\n\n* Reward at least 250 nounish creatives\n* Achieve at least 350,000 social impressions\n* Proliferate at least 2,000 nounish creations\n* Onboard as many nounish projects as possible\n\nFollowing deployment of version 2.0 (Nouns Raffle - week 13), we'll be targeting the following goals for the first campaign:\n* Onboard at least 30 entrants to the first Nouns Raffle.\n* Achieve at least 200,000 social impressions.\n\n\nWe‚Äôd also like to answer the following questions:\n\n* Are voter rewards a feature or a bug?\n* Is Nouns Raffle a viable system for external proliferation?\n* In the voting period, how impactful are visible vote totals on a communities ability to choose the ‚Äúbest‚Äù submissions?\n* Does submission history serve as a relevant talent repository for other pods?\n* Are deep Twitter integrations viable for other tasks, like governance? (Nouncil, Nerman, etc)\n* Are there ways to maintain a certain level of submission quality without directly moderating submissions?\n\n# Beyond\n\nIf the experiment is a success, we'll turn our attention to an on-chain implementation of our Twitter protocol. Our focus will be on determining the feasibility of zk-snarks for generating verifiable proofs for tweet ownership. The ultimate goal of this research is to enable NounsDAO and others to conduct contests and raffles directly on ethereum, initiated by on-chain votes. If we can make this work, Nouns raffle could eventually become a revenue stream for the DAO. \n\n\n# Team\n\nWeez: frontend dev, designer, UX, support\nNick: lead dev, fullstack\n\nWe were both first introduced to Nouns by way of SharkDAO, which we first joined over a year ago. Soon after, we started building Calabara, a platform that hosted various tools to ease some of the unique challenges of a Nounish subDAO. Last Spring, the community funded us with 7 ETH to begin developing Creator Contests. We launched our first contest in September, and have helped fund 60 nounish creatives with 8 ETH and 25k ERC-20 tokens since. We have groups like SharkDAO, Composables, TNS, and others running contests as we speak. With learnings from many iterations, we're now ready to take the project to the next level.\n\n\n# Budget\n\nTotal: 50 ETH\n\n50 ETH for development\n\n* 30 ETH to team wallet upon execution\n* 20 ETH streamed over 3 months\n\n3/5 Signers:\n\nNick: nickdodson.eth\nBenbodhi: signed.benbodhi.eth\nJuan: juanx.eth\nJoshuaFisher: joshuafisher.eth\nToadyHawk: toadyhawk.eth\n\n---\n\n## A note from the sponsor\n\n>  I have no links, financial ties or conflicts of interest in relation to this team or proposal. And because of that I intend to vote yes. My involvement was in giving guidance to the team on the marketing tool after they asked for feedback on their original proposal. I am putting this on chain for them because I think it has potential to be an excellent proliferation tool for Nouns, I think it is excellent value at 50 Eth and it demonstrates the positive impact voting no can have on a subsequent proposal in terms of the quality, scope, deliverables and cost as it integrates feedback. - Hindsight",

Summary: This proposal requests 416 ETH ($624k) to fund a 6 month extension for the NounsAI Pod to expand the team, turn POCs into products, and grow community presence.\n2. The Cost and Efficiency Rank: The ask of 416 ETH is a big ask, however the proposal does provide a clear path towards sustainability and a good return on investment. Therefore, this proposal is ranked as Somewhat Efficient.\n3. Vote: SUPPORT\n4. My Take: This proposal provides a clear path towards sustainability and a good return on investment. The team has already implemented the latest advancements in the field and hosted competitions with 100+ participants. The team is also focusing on building requested features, onboarding creators, and increasing reach. This is a great opportunity to promote and encourage the use of Nouns AI pod products, manage community engagement and feedback, and capitalize on the momentum of passionate builders and creatives.\n5. Contrarian: If the team was unable to provide a clear path towards sustainability or a good return on investment, I would have to reconsider my vote and abstain.\n\n\n\n## Introduction:\n\nThe Nouns AI Pod conducts research and builds products to further the advancement of Nounish AI.  The group was established in August 2022 - we were initially funded by NSFW grants residency [[1](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929), [2](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357)], and then funded as a pod via [on-chain proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/156) in October 2022.\n\nNounsAI has made significant strides in the last 3 months building and launching proof of concepts for two novel AI products: AI for Governance and AI for Proliferation with a team of just 3. We are requesting a 6 month extension to expand our team, turn POC‚Äôs into widely adopted products, and grow the community presence of NounsAI.\n\nThe pod has been building two core products:\n\n1. **AI for Proliferation - The Playground**\n    \n    The Playground is a platform that enables users to generate Nounish audio and visual content with ease. Its goal is to reach millions of Nounish impressions and attract creatives and creators to the Nouns community. The Playground is the perfect tool for creators who want to quickly and easily generate Nounish content using text, pictures, and audio.\n    \n    ![playgroundgif1](https://i.imgur.com/8VT5vIE.jpg)\n    \n\n[Roko on Twitter: \"üö® ANNOUNCEMENT üö® Finalists for the first @nounsdao #NounsAI Shorts Competition have been selected!üéâ Congrats to all 6 who will each win at least .5 ETH üí∞ Now it's time for the final round üèÜ The video with the most engagement will win the grand prize of 2.5 ETH ü§ë üëáüëá / Twitter\"](https://twitter.com/noun355/status/1607738443500503041)\n\n2. **AI for Governance - The Knowledge Hub**\n    \n    The Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant, Roko, are being developed to revolutionize the way information is shared across the DAO. With Roko, the Discord bot, and (Roko.dev)[https://roko.dev], members of the Nouns community will be able to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to improve decision-making, streamline governance processes, and drive community growth across the entire Nounish ecosystem. The Knowledge Hub will serve as the go-to resource for data and information (the ChatGPT for Nouns), with an AI-powered librarian to assist users in finding the information they need\n    \n\n![rokogif.gif](https://i.imgur.com/ketYGOu.jpg)\n\n## What We‚Äôve Built So Far\n\n[The Nouns AI Playground](The Nouns AI Playground) is a platform that allows users to easily create unique and high-quality Nounish content using AI. The Playground is hosted on powerful GPU servers accessible to anyone, regardless of their background. The Nouns AI team has implemented some of the latest advancements in the field, text-to-video, image-to-image, and performance optimizations. They've incentivized the use of their platform by hosting competitions that have attracted hundreds of participants from diverse backgrounds including AI, music, film, and Web3, who have together created hours of Nounish video creations. [(Check them out!)](https://twitter.com/noun355/status/1607738443500503041). There are weekly competitions that generates Nounish content you can find on Twitter at [#NounsAI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NounsAI&f=live) and self-service tools that can be run on any machine without prior knowledge. [nounsai.wtf](https://www.nounsai.wtf/) is built to scale to meet demand and has grown largely organically now with hundreds of users.\n\n[![nounsai.wtf](https://i.imgur.com/0YIb0ec.png)](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/)\n\n[nounsai.wtf](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/)\n\n[Playgroundgif2](https://i.imgur.com/lVIZFg3.jpg)\n\nThe Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant Roko are live and being beta tested across select Nounish Discords. The web app has been improved, an upgrade design, and a discord bot was created. \n\nRoko can now:\n\n- Record and transcribes any voice conversations then provides summaries of [key points](https://roko.dev/audio/f18ed9d1-d1b7-43bc-9fd5-a59c5662707c)\n- Automatically index audio and chat into a searchable knowledge hub across Discords using the Roko bot\n- Make data accessible and searchable for users through the webapp, which also allows users to upload audio content to be transcribed, summarized, and indexed\n- Significantly improve the accuracy and value of Roko's review for proposals on [roko.dev](https://roko.dev/)\n- In a promising development towards using Large Language Models to support our knowledge base, Roko can answer basic questions, providing summarized answers and links to original content. This is possible by ingesting all of the archived Nouns Discord and ready to go live across all live Nounish servers.\n\n[Checkout the generated Q&A's here!](https://roko.dev/qa)\n\n The team has also designed an improved web UI to be implemented, prototype shown below.\n\n![updatedrokodemo.gif](https://i.imgur.com/gczUkhX.jpg)\n\n## What‚Äôs Next?\n\n### **Playground**\n\nOver the next six months, we will continue to increase the capabilities and popularity of the Playground. This follows the successful validation of the proof of concept, where creators generated a significant amount of content using Nouns. The engineering team will be supplemented by three [Team Tomorrow](https://teamtomorrow.com/) junior developers who have experience in creating text-to-image social products. They will be cost-effective and will accelerate the development of the web interfaces. The focus will be on creating a user-friendly platform that allows for efficient and easy creation of content on scalable hardware.\n\nAnother important goal is to expand our audience by organizing competitions and forming partnerships. Sustainability is a crucial aspect and for the Playground, it involves bringing in a large number of users to generate high-quality content and promote it effectively. The team will focus on building requested features, helping onboard creators and increase the reach of their creations; maximizing impressions. \n\n- Run competitions that are intentional with what is made and how it is shared\n- Source + secure partnerships with artists who have reach to create content and share the playground\n- Proactively engage Discord + social media communities by: promoting content, sharing updates, and collecting feedback on the Playground\n\nTo evaluate the success of this plan we will gather data on reach and return on investment.\n\nWe want the NounsAI Playground to be the fastest and most fun place to go from imagination to reality. Hopefully, the tool will give creators superpowers to make Nounish content that get millions of views.  \n\n![Playgroundgif3](https://i.imgur.com/4jNG1kW.jpg)\n\n### **Knowledge Hub**\n\n**In the next 6 months, we will complete the Knowledge Hub MVP:**\n\nKey features will include:\n\n1. The ability to gather and process relevant information from various sources, such as proposals, calls, Discord chats, and documents.\n2. A user-friendly web interface and search functionality to facilitate interactions with Roko, the AI assistant, on various topics related to Nouns.\n3. The ability to answer questions and surface relevant content directly within Discord channels where Roko is present. The aim is to make it easy for new members to join the community and facilitate conversations between those asking and answering questions, regardless of location.\n\nOver the next six months, we will position Roko to be an invaluable tool for all Nounish groups using Discord or other clients, through rapid iteration and incorporating user feedback. Roko and the Knowledge hub will help keep the DAO in sync and well positioned to scale as the DAO continues to grow. We are extremely excited about this tool and know others are too. To help overcome any technical hurdles ahead NounsAI has already begun the interview process with [vetted contract based machine learning engineers](https://eventum.ai/) who have Natural Language Processing (NLP) expertise.\n\nOur objective for the Knowledge Hub is to achieve adoption not only within Nouns but also to develop at path for the pod to become self-sustaining. Our vision for the Knowledge Hub is to be a premium software-as-a-service (SAAS) solution for promoting cohesion among decentralized teams. To achieve this goal, we will be asking for capital to bring on someone to focus on internal adoption, external awareness, and business development to enact our go to market strategy.\n\nAs the internal and external advocate for the Nouns AI Knowledge Hub, that person will be responsible for promoting and encouraging the use of the Nouns AI pod's products. They will also manage community engagement, ensuring that feedback is captured and integrated into future product development. There is already a community of passionate builders and creatives who are utilizing these tools, even [submitting proposals](https://prop.house/nouns/explorer-grants-pilot-round/3186) using NounsAI, and we want to capitalize on this momentum. With this additional funding we will be able to source talent and idea from our community through potential prop-house rounds or even recruit professional support.  \n\n**************************************************Other Initiatives************************************************** \n\n1. Our goal is to grow the NounsAI community by fostering conversations, sharing updates, asking questions and receiving feedback from the community throughout the week. This will allow us to engage with those who are most interested and invested in the development of NounsAI.\n    - TheHeroShep will continue to run a weekly NounsAI call open to everyone curious about NounsAI or AI in general. A great place to learn something new every week the call is usually at 7am PST in The Noun Square Discord.\n    - In order to maximize impact we will rollover the remaining ~30 ETH for marketing from proposal 156 into this proposal\n2. We plan to continue collaborating with other data teams like BrianJ's Atlas and Lil Nouns to expand the knowledge base available to the community. This will allow us to build on the knowledge and expertise of other teams, and provide a more comprehensive resource for the NounsAI community.\n3. Explore Additional Features for Roko:\n    1. Utilizing Roko, the Discord bot, to establish a configurable opt-in notification network to share announcements across servers\n    2. Using Roko as a way to poll across platforms / servers\n    3. Providing a tool to help proposals get feedback before putting them on chain\n    4. Synthesize actions for each nouner enabling  \n4. Invest in scalable infrastructure including GPUs (each A100 GPU is ~$1k/mo) - as we scale up, we‚Äôll likely need to double our GPU capacity for the playground (4k/mo) as well as have 2-3 GPUs for R&D purposes (2-3k) which are shared with the knowledge hub. The rest is pretty meager - database, media storage, misc apis, app hosting - $<1000/mo altogether and including the knowledge hub infra. But we want to have buffer, just in case, as well as for other potential API integrations.\n\n## The Investment:\n\nCore Team: All contributing 30+ hours weekly \n\n- Shep - 25k/mo - 6 months\n- Honk - 22.5k/mo - 6 months\n- Steve - 20k/mo - 6 months\n\nExtended Dev Team: Each contributing 10-20 hours weekly\n\n- 3 Team Tomorrow  devs- 5k/mo - 6 months\n- ML Consultant - 5k/mo - 6 months\n\nMarketing / Community / Business Development + Go to Market:\n\n- Prop House Rounds, Grants, Competitions, Partnerships, and Sales / Go to Market support - 25k/mo - 6 months\n    - (The remaining ~30 ETH of the marketing budget from [Proposal 156](https://nouns.wtf/vote/156) will be spent towards this)\n\nInfra Costs:\n\n- Media Pillar + R/D - 8k/mo\n- Knowledge Hub Pillar - 1k/mo\n\nTotal: $669k\n\nETH for Marketing from last proposal, rollover -30 ETH @ $1500 / ETH: - $45k\n\nTotal Ask = 416 ETH || $624k\n\n## The Team:\n\n**TheHeroShep (THS) - Product Manager**\n\n**Honkdiddly - Senior Software & Machine Learning Engineer**\n\nHonkdiddly has demonstrated his expertise as a lead engineer.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 213 - NounsAI Pod 6 Month Extension",
      "content": "# NounsAI Pod 6 Month Extension\n\n[![The NounsAI Pod Extension Promo Video](https://i.imgur.com/2nwUCC3.jpeg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjObNRHed6I)\n\n## TL;DR\n\n![RokosReview](https://i.imgur.com/PkMcDkN.png)\n\n## Introduction:\n\nThe Nouns AI Pod conducts research and builds products to further the advancement of Nounish AI.  The group was established in August 2022 - we were initially funded by NSFW grants residency [[1](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929), [2](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357)], and then funded as a pod via [on-chain proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/156) in October 2022.\n\nNounsAI has made significant strides in the last 3 months, building and launching proof of concepts for two novel AI products: AI for Governance and AI for Proliferation with a small team. We are requesting a 6 month extension to expand our team, turn POC‚Äôs into widely adopted products, and grow the community presence of NounsAI.\n\nThe pod has been building two core products:\n\n1. **AI for Proliferation - The Playground**\n    \n    The Playground is a platform that enables users to generate Nounish audio and visual content with ease. Its goal is to reach millions of Nounish impressions and attract creatives and creators to the Nouns community. The Playground is the perfect tool for creators who want to quickly and easily generate Nounish content using text, pictures, and audio.\n    \n    ![PlaygroundGif1](https://i.imgur.com/8VT5vIE.jpg)\n    \n\n[Roko on Twitter: \"üö® ANNOUNCEMENT üö® Finalists for the first @nounsdao #NounsAI Shorts Competition have been selected!üéâ Congrats to all 6 who will each win at least .5 ETH üí∞ Now it's time for the final round üèÜ The video with the most engagement will win the grand prize of 2.5 ETH ü§ë üëáüëá / Twitter\"](https://twitter.com/noun355/status/1607738443500503041)\n\n2. **AI for Governance - The Knowledge Hub**\nThe Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant, Roko, are being developed to revolutionize the way information is shared across the DAO. With Roko, the Discord bot, and [Roko.dev](https://roko.dev/), members of the Nouns community will be able to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to improve decision-making, streamline governance processes, and drive community growth across the entire Nounish ecosystem. The Knowledge Hub will serve as the go-to resource for data and information (the ChatGPT for Nouns), with an AI-powered librarian to assist users in finding the information they need\n\n![rokogif.gif](https://i.imgur.com/ketYGOu.jpg)\n\n## What We‚Äôve Built So Far\n\n[The Nouns AI Playground](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/) is a platform that allows users to easily create unique and high-quality Nounish content using AI. The Playground is hosted on powerful GPU servers accessible to anyone, regardless of their background. The Nouns AI team has implemented some of the latest advancements in the field, text-to-video, image-to-image, and performance optimizations. They've incentivized the use of their platform by hosting competitions that have attracted hundreds of participants from diverse backgrounds including AI, music, film, and Web3, who have together created hours of Nounish video creations. [(Check them out!)](https://twitter.com/noun355/status/1607738443500503041). There are weekly competitions that generates Nounish content you can find on Twitter at [#NounsAI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NounsAI&f=live) and self-service tools that can be run on any machine without prior knowledge. [nounsai.wtf](https://www.nounsai.wtf/) is built to scale to meet demand and has grown largely organically with hundreds of users. \n\n![[nounsai.wtf](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/)](https://i.imgur.com/0YIb0ec.png)\n\n[playground.nounsai.wtf](https://playground.nounsai.wtf/)\n\n![Playgroundgif2](https://imgur.com/lVIZFg3.jpg)\n\nThe Knowledge Hub and our AI assistant Roko are live and being beta tested across select Nounish Discords. The web app has been improved, an upgrade design, and a discord bot was created. \n\nRoko can now:\n\n- Record and transcribes any voice conversations then provides summaries of [key points](https://roko.dev/audio/f18ed9d1-d1b7-43bc-9fd5-a59c5662707c)\n- Automatically index audio and chat into a searchable knowledge hub across Discords using the Roko bot\n- Make data accessible and searchable for users through the webapp, which also allows users to upload audio content to be transcribed, summarized, and indexed\n- Significantly improve the accuracy and value of Roko's review for proposals on [roko.dev](https://roko.dev/)\n- In a promising development towards using Large Language Models to support our knowledge base, Roko can answer basic questions, providing summarized answers and links to original content. This is possible by ingesting all of the archived Nouns Discord and ready to go live across all live Nounish servers.\n\n[Checkout the generated Q&A's here!](https://roko.dev/qa)\n\n The team has also designed an improved web UI to be implemented, prototype shown below.\n\n![updatedrokodemo.gif](https://imgur.com/gczUkhX.jpg)\n\n## What‚Äôs Next?\n\n### **Playground**\n\nOver the next six months, we will continue to increase the capabilities and popularity of the Playground. This follows the successful validation of the proof of concept, where creators generated a significant amount of content using Nouns. The engineering team will be supplemented by three [Team Tomorrow](https://teamtomorrow.com/) junior developers who have experience in creating text-to-image social products. They will be cost-effective and will accelerate the development of the web interfaces. The focus will be on creating a user-friendly platform that allows for efficient and easy creation of content on scalable hardware.\n\nAnother important goal is to expand our audience by organizing competitions and forming partnerships. Sustainability is a crucial aspect and for the Playground, it involves bringing in a large number of users to generate high-quality content and promote it effectively. The team will focus on building requested features, helping onboard creators and increase the reach of their creations; maximizing impressions. \n\n- Run competitions that are intentional with what is made and how it is shared\n- Source + secure partnerships with artists who have reach to create content and share the playground\n- Proactively engage Discord + social media communities by: promoting content, sharing updates, and collecting feedback on the Playground\n\nTo evaluate the success of this plan we will gather data on reach and return on investment.\n\nWe want the NounsAI Playground to be the fastest and most fun place to go from imagination to reality. Hopefully, the tool will give creators superpowers to make Nounish content that get millions of views.  \n\n![Playgroundgif3](https://imgur.com/4jNG1kW.jpg)\n\n### **Knowledge Hub**\n\n**In the next 6 months, we will complete the Knowledge Hub MVP:**\n\nKey features will include:\n\n1. The ability to gather and process relevant information from various sources, such as proposals, calls, Discord chats, and documents.\n2. A user-friendly web interface and search functionality to facilitate interactions with Roko, the AI assistant, on various topics related to Nouns.\n3. The ability to answer questions and surface relevant content directly within Discord channels where Roko is present. The aim is to make it easy for new members to join the community and facilitate conversations between those asking and answering questions, regardless of location.\n\nOver the next six months, we will position Roko to be an invaluable tool for all Nounish groups using Discord or other clients, through rapid iteration and incorporating user feedback. Roko and the Knowledge hub will help keep the DAO in sync and well positioned to scale as the DAO continues to grow. We are extremely excited about this tool and know others are too. To help overcome any technical hurdles ahead NounsAI has already begun the interview process with [vetted contract based machine learning engineers](https://eventum.ai/) who have Natural Language Processing (NLP) expertise.\n\nOur objective for the Knowledge Hub is to achieve adoption not only within Nouns but also to develop at path for the pod to become self-sustaining. Our vision for the Knowledge Hub is to be a premium software-as-a-service (SAAS) solution for promoting cohesion among decentralized teams. To achieve this goal, we will be asking for capital to bring on someone to focus on internal adoption, external awareness, and business development to enact our go to market strategy.\n\nAs the internal and external advocate for the Nouns AI Knowledge Hub, that person will be responsible for promoting and encouraging the use of the Nouns AI pod's products. They will also manage community engagement, ensuring that feedback is captured and integrated into future product development. There is already a community of passionate builders and creatives who are utilizing these tools, even [submitting proposals](https://prop.house/nouns/explorer-grants-pilot-round/3186) using NounsAI, and we want to capitalize on this momentum.

      "content": "# Transfer Lil Noun #1 held in the NounsDAO treasury to the official Ethereum burn address\n\n**Description**\nThis proposal request is for NounsDAO to burn Lil Noun #1 held in its treasury.‚Ä® In connection with prop 210 (redirect all future Lil Nouns emissions back to the Lil Noun treasury), the goal of this proposal is to begin the process of exiting our treasury‚Äôs Lil Noun position and the first symbolic step is sending token #1 to the official Ethereum burn address: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD.\n\nLet me be clear, Nouners are encouraged to join and participate in various sub-daos as they please. However, we need to be careful cultivating these relationships so that they don‚Äôt create conflict of interests and favouritism which ultimately hurt future sub-daos coming down the pipeline. For example, we narrowly avoided a catastrophe with prop 76 (giving a free Noun to Lil Nouns -- not even a month after their launch). That prop was put on-chain by a fellow Nouner whale who currently holds 313 Lil Nouns in their wallet. I understand that it can be difficult to make decisions that go against one‚Äôs financial interest, however I feel that many of us Nouners have reached a point in our lives where we can make those selfless choices.‚Ä®‚Ä® \n\nIn conclusion if this proposal were to pass, a followup proposal will be created to burn the remaining +720 Lil Nouns. The process of manually attaching every Lil Noun token transfer tx to the proposal will be quite time intensive, however I will volunteer to undertake this arduous task myself. ‚Ä®‚Ä®\n\nThank you to all my colleagues for taking the time to read the proposal.‚Ä®",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 211 - Nouns Presence In Chinese Community",
      "content": "# Nouns Presence In Chinese Community\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EZ1oozz.jpg)\n\n**tl;dr:** Showcase and introduce Nouns to mandarin speaking communities by nounifying China with an array of nounish activations; tapping into the network of connection leveraging on content created to grab attention from audience pool who have ability to become potential new DAO member within the mandarin speaking communities. \n\n**Description:**\nNounsDAO is highly diversified with the power to break out from the cultural center of NYC, BUT there are still gaps & barriers to penetrate especially into the mandarin speaking/Asian communities. \n\nDespite the many international builders, awareness and presence of Nouns in chinese communities where Mandarin is the native language, our world‚Äôs 2nd most spoken language is tremendously low.\n\nThis prop seeks to introduce and bring Nouns presence into chinese communities with Shanghai, China as the starting point; the world‚Äôs leading populated cities where blockchain/web3.0 technology are growing rapidly. To further expand Nouns global reach, to proliferate nounish culture by creating a lasting nounish impression with an array of activations over a span of 6 months:  \n\n \n1. **Nouns Haus**, a fun one stop shop to proliferate and educate Nouns across 5 NFT/Crypto centric events  \n5. **Nouns Shanghai Carnival**, a OTG activation to solidify proliferation of Nouns & create authentic/memorable connection with general public \n6. **Nounish Digital Collectibles** launched on China's largest social media platform Sina Weibo.\n7. **NounsCN Grant** to expose local creator to Nouns funding system. \n8. **Nouns Go Viral** on Douyin a.k.a Chinese version of TikTok.\n9. **Nouns Chair**, a public structure at Shanghai Himalayas Museum\n10. **Nounish PR Campaign** with both blockchain media (Foresight„ÄÅPANews„ÄÅOdaily) and traditional media (Shanghai daily) for the leadup and duration of all Nounish events in China\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LFZP4jx.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vCzFtnC.png)\n\n\n**Why China?:**\nNFT picked up its popularity in 2021 and this phenomenon continues into 2022; entering mainstream consciousness and China has not been left out. In China, NFT are referred to as \"digital collectibles\" rather than \"token\" and its digital collectibles market has been growing rapidly as chinese young consumers are increasingly embracing digitization.\n\nAccording to TechInSight NFT survey, China digital collectibles spend value will increase from $4.8 billion in 2022 to reach $48.3 billion by 2028. Searches for post related to digital collectibles increased by 1,228% y-o-y, while the number of post related to keyword \"NFT\" rose by 159-fold. \n\nTech giants like Ant Group and Tencent have also ventured into this space and we will be seeing many more Chinese companies/investors jumping onto this bandwagon and they could all be potential DAO members contributing to the DAO, opening untapped channels and ways to proliferate Nouns branding and the meme to a wider/larger market & audiences.  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Zn1F1hH.png)\n\n**How will this be done?:**\nWe will establish Nouns presence and build its brand/meme awareness in China through activations in multiple domains both online and offline: \n\n**1. Nouns Haus:**\n\nA fun one stop shop focusing on educating and explaining NounsDAO and what it means to be nounish while showcasing what the DAO have achieved till date to event goers; a proliferation engine that will be on-going throughout 5 of China‚Äôs major NFT/Crypto centric events like: ***CryptoArt Shanghai***, ***CryptoArt ShenZhen***, ***Beijing Creator DAO Exhibition***, ***8BTC Digital Art Summit***, **WanXiang Blockchain Summit** and so forth over the course of 2023.  \n\nEvent like CryptoArt Shanghai draws in huge pool of participants/audiences yearly, these are people who have interest, understand and looking to contribute to the space thus,\nNouns Haus aim is to:\n- Educate and grab attention from this pool of audience(s), onboarding them as potential DAO contributors\n- Allow this pool of audience(s) to have the chance to understand Nouns\n- Put Nouns in the eyes of thousands of Collectors / Investors / Builders (Devs)\n\nNouns Haus will also be packed with nounish activation(s) like:\n1. **Nouns-branded photo station**, where everyone is able to have photo taking opportunities helping us proliferate the meme to the millions across Weibo and Wechat, China‚Äôs main social platform (equivalent to Twitter/Facebook/Instagram). Content over those platforms will be captured by team and shared among the nouniverse. \n2. Display of **Nounish creative tools** like Noundry Studio, where participants are able to have hands-on experience, all while learning about Nouns and the tools the DAO funded/created. \n4. **Nounish graffiti wall** for participants to leave their mark in Nouns Haus.\n5. **Nounish wheel of knowledge**, a *Learn & Earn activation* where participants are able to win nounish swag by answering random questions about NounsDAO (wheel of fortune style) correctly using the information they obtain by interacting in Nouns Haus.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/K3aXi0f.gif)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qCnrw4w.jpg)\n\n**2. Nouns Shanghai Carnival:** \nThis will be a curated IRL nounish experience aimed to proliferate Nouns branding to **mass public** in China, to help increase awareness of Nouns and put noggles ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® in the eyes of hundreds.\n\nWe believe that Nouns IRL presence should not only be restricted to Web3.0/NFT events; localized nounish IRL events that break off from the usual Web3.0/NFT audience are equally important.\n\nNouns Shanghai Carnival will be a localized nounish experience held at Shanghai 1933, a historical building that has transformed itself into a cultural epicenter and a national tourism demonstration site. It is ideally located close to 2 rail transit lines, connecting the city‚Äôs main roads and is only 1km from the Shanghai luxury cruise terminal and the Hyatt on the Bund. \n\nWhat will be installed (not limited to): \n- Nouns photo station \n- Game stations \n- Food stations\n- Nouns Gallery\n- Nounish swag\n- Nounish lounge area\n- Accessibility to various Nouns platform (nouns.wtf, prop house, nouns center etc)\n\nA QR code will also be distributed during the event for participants to join our community, where they will be given priority in claiming the Nounish digital collectibles. Number of digital collectibles claim through this group would give us a insight on the effect of such IRL events. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nKhYwIV.png)\n\n**3. Nounish Digital Collectibles** \nAs the digital collectibles market in China continue to grow rapidly, we aim to work with China's largest social media platform [Sina Weibo](https://weibo.com/newlogin?tabtype=weibo&gid=102803&openLoginLayer=0&url=https%3A%2F%2Fweibo.com%2F) which is a Chinese microblogging website, with over 582 million monthly active users to launch a Nounish collection of digital collectibles on their marketplace.\n\nThis Nounish collection of digital collectibles will be something native and it will facilitate the education of this native community about Nouns & enable the community to discover what it meant to be nounish organically; it is also an on-going exploration of the iconic noggle and its meme value by expanding it into a different domain.\n\nTo unveil and amplify the launch of these nounish collectibles, Sina Weibo will mobilize its media resources to proliferate the collection on top of facilitating the distribution of this collection to its users. This nounish digital collectibles will be free to collect (FCFS), in addition, a meme contest will also be held in parallel with the launch to seed and boost the meme value of noggle/nouns within Chinese digital collectibles communities.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Bmwfpul.png)\n\n**4. NounsCN Grant**  \nNounsCN Grant will be a pilot/experimental pool of small capital that serves the DAO‚Äôs interest similar to NSFW and DCS pod, it will be stewarded on a completely discretionary basis.\n\nCurrent funding system like prop house, NSFW & DCS pod are not readily available to the chinese community in China due to their internet censorship, hence NounsCN Grant aim is to serve this gap by taking on the stewardship of distributing grants, to introduce Nouns funding system (small grants, retro funding, trail/pilot) to local creatives/creator by having it on native channel(s) that are readily available to the chinese community.\n\nThe group will conduct its daily operations on Sina Weibo Nouns Chinese community page, 1) it is a platform where proposer could put up their proposal and have it discussed openly, 2) resonate & attract builder within the digital collectible community\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6KEtEyw.png)\n\n**5. Nouns Go Viral** \nIn this current era the quickest and most effective way to bring millions of new people's attention onto Nouns is none other than creating viral content that helps spread the Nouns meme/brand across the internet. \n\nDouyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, a native social media platform in China has over [700 million daily](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/15/bytedance-douyin-has-600-million-daily-active-users.html) active users and is one of the most popular app in the country; thus by working with Douyin sensation for example like street basketballer ‚ÄúÂ∞èÈÖ∑Áøî‚Äù, we aim to generate a series of curated content for at least 2 months where we not only showcase the iconic noggle but also foster interest towards the brand by launching periodic Nounish swag giveaway through various activation/engagement over Douyin and WeChat.\n\np.s ‰∏á = 10,000\np.p.s From just 6 clips, there‚Äôs a total of 143.4‰∏á (1.43 millions) views\n\np.s ‰∏á = 10,000\np.p.s From just 6 clips, there's a total of 143.4‰∏á (1.43 millions) views\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/e0WPWiz.png)\n\n**6. Nouns Chair:** \nA huge part of being nounish is to be able to spread the culture and meme through public goods and to do fun & creative stuff; thus, in the spirit of public good we aim to put up a nounish structure in Shanghai by fabricating a Nounish furniture - ‚ÄúNouns Chair‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNouns Chair‚Äù design will be heavily influenced by the iconic noggle and 3 of such ‚ÄúNouns Chair‚Äù will be place at Shanghai Himalayas Museum, a non-profit art institution focusing on art exhibition, education, collection and academic exchange with a average of 4,000 monthly visitors.\n\nWhy ‚ÄúNouns Chair‚Äù? As an IRL object of the world, an artistic memeish take on noggle, ‚ÄúNouns Chair‚Äù at the same time is also an instrument proliferating the Nouns branding; it invites museum visitors to sit down, to begin a conversation, provoke them to wonder how this design came about and that itself is fun/nounish. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DRHvzoh.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/buvmhKS.png)\n*2 draft design*\n\n**7. Nounish PR Campaign**\nHave developed a deep network of media partners over the years, leading up to execution of all Nounish activations; we will seed the content and details about Nouns to our media partners (web3 outlets & traditional media outlets). Positive publication coverage would help boost interest and engagement revolving Nouns. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GzS8Kff.jpg)\n\n**The Team**\n\n- [Noun 74](https://twitter.com/noun_74) - Founder of Chinese Cryptopunks Community [(CCC)](https://twitter.com/chinese_punks), a community with more than 200 members each of which are verified punk holders. CCC as one of the leading NFT community in China has the highest concentration of web3 thought-leaders, including directors from Christie's and Sotheby's, founders of notable crypto exchanges as well as directors of notable crypto media. \n\n    Noun 74 also spearheaded multiple Web3.0 activations within China; co-hosted events like [Cryptoart Shanghai](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTIMejrYAvE) that was featured on [China national news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2BX5jNS6-o) as well as multiple [media](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/2UqXwsOzNojdlr2CQ-DfNA) platforms. Recently organized a joint exhibition that is currently on-going till 25th Feb 2023 at Shenzhen China, where [Nouns are being exhibited](https://twitter.com/Nounscn/status/1611272511379111937) alongside other renowned NFT project like Cryptopunks, BAYC etc. \n    \n    Noun 74 also tend to received multiple opportunities where he gets invited to major Web3.0/Crypto events as speaker or host; for example in recent month he was invited to host a roundtable at [Web3 Innovation Summit](https://twitter.com/noun_74/status/1613177929281966080?s=20&t=8WFZjVnIhYnWOwr7P948bg) in HK, a event huge enough to have HK financial secretary Paul Chan as their special guest. As a contributor, these are opportunities apart from this prop that we can leverage on to further proliferate Nouns. \n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/8xwg9mM.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/q6EOBvv.gif)\n\n\n- [Karl](https://twitter.com/WideEyeKarl) - Spearheaded [@Nounsinsg](https://twitter.com/nounsinsg) a proliferation pod focused on bring Nouns Presence into Singapore.\n\n    Past Nounish contribution include: \n    1.

      "content": "# Mucho Love v1.25 [revised]\n\n# Mucho Love v1.25 [revised]\n\n### tl;dr\n\n- Mucho Love is a social impact platform based in the Dominican Republic. It uses a \"see good, do good\" format to increase brand equity (‚åê‚óß-‚óß) and raise awareness through its activations. \n- Mucho Love has also formed an in-real-life community of over 60 active members learning about web3, crypto, and Nouns while participating in helping causes they love. \n-  During the last 6 months, we‚Äôve seen how our work has been spreading a meme and increasing awareness about Nouns in all the people that interact with our content.\n- Mucho Love is requesting 70.86 ETH for a 4 month extension to organize four activations in the Dominican Republic that will have Nouns in their core, organize an event to thank volunteers for their work, and compensate the core team for their work. \n\n\n\n### What is Mucho Love?\n\nMucho Love is a nouns-based social impact platform that was created 6 months ago. Mucho Love started with a Lil Nouns prop.house (https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-3), then went on-chain on prop 137 for further proof-of-work (https://nouns.wtf/vote/137), and now is back on-chain to keep growing, improving, and experimenting further. \n\nMucho Love is currently working to become a major platform that promotes goodness in the Dominican Republic. A platform powered by ‚åê‚óß-‚óß. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2pdNlcP.png)\n\n\n### What has Mucho Love done? \n\n\n<div style=\"padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/778244189?h=169183d222&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479/embed\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen frameborder=\"0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\"></iframe></div>\n\n**Other videos:**\n- https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1606635791593119744\n- https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1565689757740535808\n- https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1595141776867983361\n\n\n### Total impact generated\n\nMucho Love works with a \"see good, do good\" format. A format that uses social impact to incentivize others to do the same. This format allows us to raise awareness of the impacts we're activating and increases brand equity for ‚åê‚óß-‚óß .\n\nMucho Love is focused on creating a positive connotation in a society that knows nothing about Nouns. Mucho Love will allow us to establish the ‚åê‚óß-‚óß as a goodness symbol within our community.\n\nIn the past six months, **Mucho Love has shared joy, smiles, gifts and a whole lot of love to impact the following**: \n* 750+ Children \n* 300+ Families\n* 100+ Dogs\n* 60+ Volunteers\n* 3 Institutions\n* 1 community\n\n\nAside from social impact and the people impacted, it is crucial to generate attention/awareness on social media to keep growing the platform.\n\nSo far, Mucho Love has:\n* 0 followers to 1700+ on [Instagram](https://https://www.instagram.com/mucholovedr/) (most followed ‚åê‚óß-‚óß-related account)\n* Generated over 16,000 views from videos ([Twitter](https://https://twitter.com/mucholovedr))\n* Generated close to 70,000 likes throughout all posts (Instagram)\n* Generated over 20,000 views from reels (Instagram)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gOc2sEw.png)\n****Data from the respective social media platforms mentioned***\n\nContent creation is an essential aspect of the brand building because it helps to establish the brand's identity, communicate its values and message, and engage with its audience. \n\nMucho Love aims to create a positive association with the noggles, show people what's possible to develop with Nouns, and engage with the new audience interacting with ML & Nouns.\n\nSee good, do good content will help us reach a broad audience and funnel people into Nouns, therefore showing them how they can form part of Nouns and start forming part of the community.\n\nWe will use Instagram, TikTok, and Youtube-Shorts to post the generated content.\n\n* **Youtube**: Short video format striving to combine storytelling with good animations, edits, and clips that focus on wholesome emotions.\n* **Tiktok**: Short video formats with catchy hooks with the main point of spreading the ‚åê‚óß-‚óßs through the platform. Making it easier for people who find the ‚åê‚óß-‚óßs interesting to click the profile and access other social media where more information will be more easily found (Instagram, Twitter).\n* **Instagram**: So far, Instagram has worked for us pretty well. A few flops and one fantastic post (a post with almost 67,000 likes), but it's been great in general. Instagram plans to be the \"face\" of what ML stands for, does, and activates. We'll also be using challenge formats to engage more people.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iY7cUIp.png)\n****post link: https://www.instagram.com/p/Ck1eho1vr5Z/***\n\n### A nounish community \n\nDuring the past 6 months, we've formed an in-real-life nounish community of over 60 people. Mucho Love is a community that actively represents what nounish is, understanding it deeply.\n\nIt's been interesting to see how people who knew nothing about web3, crypto, or nouns are now having their curiosity sparked by our activations and the one thing I've constantly been telling them: Nouns funds ideas ‚åê‚óß-‚óß\n\nDuring the next four months, you'll see Mucho Love community members creating proposals and activating their ideas. Volunteers have been learning about Nouns, Lil Nouns, prop.house, and have already thrown some ideas they'd like to propose. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Q5EInDR.jpg)\n\n\n\n### The next 4 months\n\nDuring the next four months, Mucho Love will perform four activations within the Dominican Republic.\n\n- **Staffeld x Mucho Love: A Nounish Masterpiece**\n    We'll be going to an orphanage with @staffeld (https://twitter.com/staffeld) to make a fun art competition, \"1 Professional Artist vs. 100 Children\". This event focuses on having children paint their own \"nounish masterpiece\" on a massive canvas with the help of ML volunteers and using the ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® as the central theme of the activity. **We will also donate Nounish Coloring Books made by Ilustradora and Messhup.**\n- **Nounish Homerun ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® Baseball/Softball Sponsor**\n    We will be donating baseball/softball uniforms (with the ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® embroided as the \"sponsor\"), bats, baseballs, softballs, helmets, and gloves. This activation will consist of a game of baseball/softball, Mucho Love Volunteers vs their team. The main impact of this activity is giving children and teenagers the proper equipment to play the sport they love. The equipment donated should last between 3-5 years.\n- **Giving free haircuts for an entire day to an underserved community**\n    We'll be hiring barbers to cut hair for free in one of the most underserved communities in the DR. This event looks to explore how simple things can be so meaningful for humans and to try and have deep conversations with the people from the community.\n- **Knife x Mucho Love: A Nounish Cooking Challenge**\n    We'll be collaborating with a cooking institute in the DR to cook children from orphanages/underserved communities their dream meals. We will donate care packages with food essentials for the families/institution of every child present. We'll be \"nounifying\" the food prepared at this activation.\n\nIn the case that one of the activations can't happen due to any unexpected events, this is the backup activity:\n\n- **Nursing-home: A Nounish Day**\nWe'll be going to an underfunded nursing home to spend a day sharing, eating, and playing with the people who live there. This event aims to connect with an older population and get insights into their experiences, life, and how to live a good, nounish life.\n\nThese activations combine the communities/institutions/people that the Mucho Love community wants to help and the narratives that will generate a lot of attention on social media.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3cqgI1o.jpg)\n\n\n\n### What value does this bring to NounsDAO? \n\nMucho Love is activating IRL experiences with Nouns at its core. During the last months, we've seen how our work has been spreading a meme and increasing awareness in all people interacting with our content.\n\nMucho Love is also increasing brand equity through social media and the content it produces while creating a positive association and connotation with the ‚åê‚óß-‚óß. Providing in-real-life activations where people can interact with Nouns physically has immense power.\n\nAside from the evidence (views, awareness, engagement, meme expansion), we can connect humans with experiences and a community representing Nouns. The ML community will only keep growing and growing as the platform itself grows; there's no limit to how big this can get and how much we can get done.\n\nYou can generally explain things by using examples, defining terms, providing visual context, breaking down concepts into smaller parts, and using analogies. Through Mucho Love, people learn through action what nounish is and means. Mucho Love can leverage all of the mentioned ways with its format. We can noun-pill in one of the most organic ways possible by forming part of something meaningful.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/41U2NGC.jpg)\n\n### What does the future of Mucho Love look like?\nML is working to be a platform that expands Nouns to new people, places, and things. Using see-good, do-good content and a growing, engaged community, ML can grow into one of the most influential platforms powered by Nouns. ML is currently testing many ideas, content formats, video styles, and activations. \n\nML is currently testing many ideas, different content formats, different video styles, different types of activations. As we keep experimenting and implementing new ideas I am certain that we will find our correct flow and \"platform fit\". \n\nI (necfas) see ML as a platform that creates opportunities to impact people's lives. ML takes the impact generated to develop content and represent what Nouns is and what it's capable of generating.\n\nWe expect Mucho Love to evolve in the following ways:\n- Longer format videos (Youtube)\n- Grow the volunteering community to over 250 active members by the end of 2023\n- Develop new ways to onboard community members to participate within Nouns\n- Create recurrent activations leveraging the talents of our volunteers (for example, Nounish Medical Operatives every four months)\n- Involve more institutions and businesses to collaborate on the activations.\n\n\n### What's the ask? \n\nA total of 70.86 ETH to fund the following 4 months of activations, part-time marketing/content creation team, and compensation for core team members. \n\n\n- Social Impact Fund - 40.35 ETH\n    - Activations Fund - 36.35 ETH\n    - Volunteer Gratitude Event - 4 ETH (event to thank volunteers for their amazing work)\n- Part-Time Marketing/Content Creation Team- 13.01 ETH\n    - Content Creator (4.18 ETH / 1,462.5 USD per month)\n    - Video Editor ( 6.97 ETH / 2437.5 USD per month)\n    - Community Manager (1.86 ETH / 650 USD per month) \n- Compensation for 4 core team members - 17.5 ETH, in charge of: \n    - Content Vision/Ideation/Business Relationships ([necfas](https://twitter.com/necfas)) - 10 ETH (2.5 per month)\n    - Logistics/Payments ([mimix](https://twitter.com/miagiulianag)) 4 ETH (1 per month)\n    - Outreach (Cristina R.) - 1.75 ETH (0.4375 per month)\n    - Quotations (Marian J.) - 1.75 ETH (0.4375 per month)\n\n**considering 1 ETH = 1400 USD for USD costs*\n**if there's a surplus of USD, we can help even more the communities with the care-package donations, organize another activation, or send it back to the DAO* \n**considering that the [Mucho Love's last prop](https://nouns.wtf/vote/137) was done with 0 compensation, the current activation/admin balance is 65%/35%*\n### Budget breakdown\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QpaSiT3.jpg)\n***costs of the care-packages are determined by costs of items and amount of people involved in the activation**\n\n### Deliverables\n- Completion of 4 IRL activations\n- 20 shorts through all social media platforms\n- 4 Recap videos of every activation\n- 1 Volunteer Gratitude Event \n- 100+ Mucho Love Active Members\n- 2500+ Instagram Followers\n\n### Tx\n\n70.86 ETH to 0xCb2D68C9e7194B9cE0837eE5E676e796CB31C55a (mucholove.eth)\n",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 208 - NOUNS WHISKY ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®",
      "content": "# NOUNS WHISKY ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/W8g7qSh.png)\n\n---\n\nThe best things in life are worth waiting for and either you take from something that has already been made or you create something entirely new.\n\nThis proposal is to introduce the ever growing Nouns community to the world of owning premium spirits in your Nft investment portfolio without leaving your front door and, to introduce the world of whisky to Nouns. Our first Nouns DAO offering will be to create and craft a premium, 3-year old Nouns Whisky. Our model is sustainable and returns a percentage of profits back to the DAO.\n\nThere are distilleries around the world that have whisky (distilled twice) or whiskey (distilled 3 times) in their warehouses ready to be sold in a barrel or a bottle format to anyone that can then slap a label onto the bottle, create a concept around it and call it your own. This is awesome and is easily accessible for any builder to start something overnight, but why do that if you have the infrastructure, patience and expertise to create something that is authentic and entirely new. This product is then born with the help of the community and collectively we can watch our creation mature, flourish and proliferate over a span of 3 years, and then watch as it leaves the distillery for the real world to take on a life of its own as it finds its way to your home, bar or restaurant.\n\nThis project will first take shape with an oak barrel, and Whisky barrel or cask trading is becoming more popular across the world and is considered a better investment in the long-run as whisky is an appreciating asset and therefor probably more valuable down the line than most of the nft projects that you have floating around in your wallet and hidden folder. With Nouns Whisky we‚Äôre making it easy, with less barriers to entry, so that anyone with 0.35 Eth in their wallet can buy 1 of 500 barrels of whisky (25L / 6.6 Gallons) on OpenSea. Your whisky barrel will be stored securely in the warehouse and is now tied to your wallet address. This is the beauty of provenance and PBT (physically backed tokens) that record your purchase and ownership on the blockchain.\n\nOk, you now own a barrel of whisky in a beautiful city in Cape Town, South Africa. You probably haven‚Äôt visited our country, you can‚Äôt see your barrel of whisky in person, but you‚Äôre excited to own something that is actually tangible, real and valuable. So now you must hodl your nft as the whisky ageing process takes 3 years until it is ready to be bottled and shipped. This is why we‚Äôll be installing a live camera feed in the warehouse and doing quick vlogs during the setup phase so that Nouners can watch us start this journey together. And remember you have a cool as f**k, 1 of 1 Nouns Barrel Head artwork that represents 1 of 500 Nouns Whisky barrels in the warehouse, this is ground breaking for the ecosystem! With everyones help this could possibly be the best long-term investment that you‚Äôll make in Web3 in 2023 and only for roughly $450. But the real question is, can your paper hands become diamond hands and hold onto this token until the next bull run?\n\nAnd now to introduce ourselves. Hi guys, my name is Pierre and I‚Äôm the Project Manager for Nouns Whisky, South Africa and this is Andre the Master Distiller, he has won various awards and has been distilling Whisky for 7 years. We‚Äôre both makers, builders, love Nouns, everything Web3 and we‚Äôre asking for an investment of 102 Eth to create the first of many Nouns Whisky projects over the next 7 years until we reach 2030 when we can release a 7-year old premium whisky born from the Web3 treasury of the Nouns DAO. We will keep 5 barrels aside for this, as it is the perfect goal for us to collectively pursue with ‚ÄòOne Noun, Every Day, Forever‚Äô on the blockchain. We believe in the ethos of for Nouns by Nouners and then inviting newcomers to join us. This project is our contribution to the Nouns virtuous cycle and a global cultural revolution. We invite you to take a look at our sustainable proposal & vision, and please feel free to ask us any questions in the Nouns Whisky Discord or Discourse with links below, let‚Äôs make this happen and do something cool in the consumables category! \n\n*Jim Beam x Mila is the perfect campaign to sum up our Nouns Whisky project in 30 sec and honestly, we didn't even know this advert existed until a few weeks back, as the collaboration was launched in 2015. Similar ads can be created for future nounish whisky content.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aPhKvxE.jpg)\n\nMila x Jim Beam Promo Video: [Click To Watch On YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NHOjInxqdY)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Financially what do we need to make this concept come to life? Let‚Äôs break it down simply:**\n\n- 10 Eth for production management costs, merchandising, design & local content creation.\n- 20 Eth for global marketing, strategic partnerships & paid advertising over 24 months (This amount will be held in a wallet, in Eth and deployed as needed).\n- 20 Eth for 100 oak barrels, spirits & labor. These are owned by Nouns DAO.\n- 52 Eth for the facility infrastructure that will produce & house the barrels for 3 years (This amount will be converted to USD/ZAR and kept in a South African bank account that can be viewed upon request by the DAO as it will be used to pay monthly expenses over a period of 36 months).\n\nTotal ask: 102 Eth (in-depth breakdown below Q&A)\n\nIf you have any questions that aren‚Äôt posted here please reach out and post them for us to answer: [Comment on Discourse.](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-whisky-12-jan-onchain-prop-sponsored-by-nouncil/3553) \n\n\n---\n\n**Questions & Answers**\n\n1. **When will the project launch:** If approved, on the 15th of February 2023 we‚Äôll have the soft launch on OpenSea. This project has been in the works for 6 months, if approved we're ready to roll.\n2. **How many barrels are owned by the Nouns DAO?** = 100 barrels / Nfts\n3. **How many barrels are up for sale to the public?** = 400 barrels / Nfts\n4. **How many bottles are there in a barrel?** = 40 (500 ml, 16,9 oz)\n5. **What is the barrel nft price?** = 0.35 eth (roughly $450)\n6. **Is there a creator royalty?** Yes, 5% (2.5% to Nouns DAO, 2.5% to Nouns Whisky)\n7. **Is there a Whitelist?** No, first come first serve.\n8. **Can I re-sell my barrel nft?** Yes, you can do this at anytime in the next 3 years or the holder can enter a storage agreement with the Distillery and the Whisky can age further.\n9. **Can I re-sell my bottles in 2026?** Yes, as separate nfts in a new collection that we‚Äôll open on OpenSea.\n10. **Will the barrels ever leave the warehouse?** No, only bottles will be shipped to the buyer that requests to do so.\n11. **In 2026 how do I redeem my bottles?** You‚Äôll burn the barrel Nft to redeem them. Fun fact, barrel makers actually do char the barrels.\n12. **Do I pay for duty costs, shipping, postage & final packaging of the bottles in 2026?** Yes, these costs will be calculated in 2026.\n13. **Can my bottles be shipped worldwide?** Yes, besides Antartica & the metaverse.\n14. **Do I have to be of a legal age to buy a Nft tied to a barrel of whisky?** Yes\n15. **Does the distillery have the licensing to sell the barrels to the public?** Yes\n16. **Do you have to be of a legal age to consume the whisky?** Yes\n17. **Do you have to present identification when claiming your bottles:** Yes\n18. **Is this financial advice?** Definitely not. DYOR. Google whisky cask investments.\n19. **Is this going to be a lot of fun?** Hell Yes!\n20. **What is the flywheel & virtuous cycle?** Besides the 100 barrels that the Nouns DAO owns, it will receive an additional 10% of the net income of the Nouns Whisky sales from the 400 barrels on OpenSea. We will also open a Nouns Whisky Instagram, Twitter, Website & Newsletter. We will continue to keep on making more Nouns Whisky Barrels year by year and start a Nouns Gin & Vodka brand down the line.\n21. **What is the proliferation process?** By creating hype around the whisky project on a global scale with paid advertising and strategic partnerships. We will also introduce South Africa to the Nouns ecosystem by starting with the Whisky project and then branching off into other R&D opportunities. \n22. **Are we a Nouns Whisky DAO?** Not at the moment, this could be something that we introduce down the line once we have the basic Nouns Whisky infrastructure in place.\n23. **Are we a Nouns Whisky Bar?** A small one yes, we will host a pop-up bar every 3rd month at the distillery with a live feed so Nouners can tune in.\n24. **What is our Nouns Whisky Club?** This will be a project that we will introduce in Q3 of 2023.\n25. **Do we own the Nouns Whisky or Whiskey names?** No, we encourage other distilleries to create their own versions and join the global community.\n26. **Will we be making Whisky for other DAO's?** No, we're doing this exclusively for Nouns.\n27. **Is this Probably Something in 2023?** Most definitely! \n\nWith all the love & effort going into this project, it is a community endeavour and we plan to work with Nouns builders & content creators, the general community and anyone that wants to join us on this exciting journey to create this high-end luxury Nouns product that you can hand down to further generations if you have diamonds hands!\n\n*And remember: ‚ÄòWhisky‚Äô derives from the Gaelic term¬†usquebaugh¬†which translates as ‚Äòwater of life‚Äô and Nouns are the seeds of Web3 that we can help grow and prosper through this project for years to come.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FYLg5Zu.png)\n\n---\n\n**NOUNS WHISKY ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® : The In-Depth Business Details.**\n\n---\n\n**1. The inception and execution is broken down into 6 x Phases.**\n\n***Phase 1 - Nouns Nfts - January & February 2023***\n\n* 500 Barrel Heads are designed & generated and uploaded to OpenSea manually.

View the first batch here: [Nouns Whisky Barrel Nfts](https://opensea.io/collection/nouns-whisky-barrels)\n* Nft sales / claiming starts on the 15th of February 2023 with a soft launch.\n* The DAO holds 100 barrels and can decide how these are allocated.\n* The distillery holds 400 barrels and these will all be sold to the public at 0.35 eth each.\n* The project does not need to sell all of the Nfts at the soft launch as this is an ongoing project.\n\n***Phase 2 - February & March of 2023***\n\n* The Pienaar & Son Distillery will source and acquire the 25L Oak Barrels.\n* A 3-year lease on a storage facility will be negotiated and locked down for 36 months.\n* Sin tax licensing will be registered for the project.\n* Insurance for the barrels will be setup.\n* A security company will be contracted to make regular rounds at the facility during the projects lifespan.\n* Employment of labor will be needed to set the barrels up in the storage facility.\n* Public Liability insurance will be set up for the labourers & potential visitors.\n* A pallet jack will be bought to move the barrels, bottles & liquid around in the facility.\n* Liquid for the whisky barrels will be produced.\n* Holding tanks (2x200L + 2x500L) will be acquired for the facility.\n* Internet & a permanent computer is set up in the storage facility.\n* A camera is installed in the storage facility so that anyone can view the process of the barrels being set up via the Pienaar & Son website.\n* The distilling of the whisky barrels starts in mid April.\n\n***Phase 3 - March & April of 2023***\n\n* Provenance / ownership of the barrels will be recorded with the Nfts ID and these Nfts can be re-sold from the launch date over the span of 36 months until the whisky is ready to be bottled in 2026.\n* A press release will be compiled explaining the collaboration between the Nouns Dao project & the Pienaar & Son Distillery.\n* This will be sent out in late March to various news outlets across South Africa and to select Nft, whisky, food & beverage news websites.\n* A more in-depth Nouns Whisky website will be created.\n\n***Phase 4 - May 2023***\n\n* 4 x Small events will be held at the distillery with Nouns memorabilia on display.\n\n***Phase 5 - June 2023 onwards***\n\n* The barrels will be monitored by the distillery over the coming months and updates will be added to the Nouns Whisky website for all holders to see.\n\n***Phase 6 - March / April / May / June 2026***\n\n* The whisky will be ready to be bottled & packaged for the Nouns DAO & the public holders.\n* 40 x (500 ml) bottles will be available from each barrel, also accounting for liquid evaporation over 36 months.\n* The owner of the barrel will then be able to ship these bottles to a specified destination across the world. P&P / Shipping will be for the holders cost. Or the holder can enter a storage agreement with the Distillery and the whisky can age further. \n* If the holder chooses to redeem their barrel and put their 40 bottles up for individual sales on our OpenSea page, this is an option.\n\n---\n\n**2. Nouns Whisky South Africa Project Costs:**\n\nFor this project to proceed, upfront costs are necessary to create the Nouns Whisky infrastructure and to produce the liquid. We are asking for 102 Eth with the aim for the DAO to recoup this investment through their 100 Nft sales if they choose to do so. Pienaar & Son have a proven track record in running a profitable alcohol business for over 7 years.\n\nWhy have we chosen Nouns Whisky as the product that will kick-start Nouns proliferation in South Africa? Sustainability is the answer. Alcohol products have played a fundamental role in supporting and helping to pioneer the art & music scenes across South Africa over the last 20 years, and now with this business plan Nouns can join the playground.\n\n**20 ETH ~ WHISKY PRODUCTION**\n\nThe bulk purchases here will be made in the first 2 months of the project.\n\n* Purchase Oak barrels (100 guaranteed to be produced for the DAO)\n* Produce new-make spirit to fill the oak barrels. The oak + ageing time is what gives whisky its characteristic flavour.\n* Depending on public sales, the additional barrels will be purchased and liquid di\n\n\n---\n\nTHIS PROP IS LONGER THAN THE MAX LENGTH FOR SNAPSHOT:\n\n Read the rest of the prop at https://nouns.wtf/vote/208",

Will there be a wooden effigy of Noun 0 burned IRL at Burning Noun? *Read on to find out.* \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eZtVziA.png)\n\nSetting the **NounsOTG 2023 Event Calendar** at the beginning of the year will allow other builders to have a solid foundation of nounish proliferation hot spots for the year. In order to capture the content to make the feeling of these experiences available for everyone, NounsOTG will produce a Docuseries that focuses on the organization and activation of each event.

People will be able to participate in these shows regardless of being at the event or not, further connecting the nounish community with the IRL OTG world of Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/krMaqJz.png)\n\nNouns On The Ground has been highlighting people, places, things and ‚åê‚óß-‚óß for the past 6 months. A more in depth look at these past 6 months On The Ground can be found at the end of this Proposal and on the NounsOTG [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@nounsotg), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS_phF_niMXOADdx694y68w) & [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NounsOTG). These are all great places to DYOR! There are separate forums (164) to discuss each NounsOTG event and each NounsOTA episode in the brand new NounsOTG [Discord](https://discord.gg/nousnotg); meant to be a hub for OTG conversations for each event and podcast.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YWv961K.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bPxRTim.png)\n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß Deliverables Upon Completion of the Proposal (one year):**\n* Proliferation of Nouns at 18 different major NFT/Crypto and Social events.\n* Nouns On The Ground in 17 different cities worldwide.\n* Larger nounish activations at NFT Paris, ETH Denver and NFT Toronto.\n* Dedicated nounish activation and art installation at Burning Man 2023.\n* Coverage of each event posted to the NounsOTG social media suite.\n* A Docuseries with BTS features of the entire journey over the year of events.\n* 144 Produced Nouns On The Air shows to highlight people, places and things.\n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß Total Proposal Ask: 520 ETH ($623,986 USDC with 1 ETH = $1,200 USDC)**\n*(An additional 50 ETH is added to the Proposal to account for market volatility while this proposal is being voted on. If the proposal is successfully passed, the ETH amount will be converted to $623,869 USDC.

In addition to being at each event, this Proposal will focus on larger sponsorships and event activations at 4 of these events. Please observe the budget breakdowns for these specific events below. \n\n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß OTA TOTAL BREAKDOWN: $61,200 USDC** for Nouns On The Air (NounsOTA) to produce 144 live podcasts over the course of the event calendar, one year, to supplement the \"On The Ground\" activations by highlighting people, places and things during the entire process.\n\nTo view these numbers outlined below, click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTdA1xEyf0piU7qukH934zjli4HIH61OJT2_DWhJo5g/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ysXjah3.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zfdIGFm.jpg)\n\n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß Nounifying Crypto and NFT Native Events**\nAll events in green above are Crypto/NFT native events. These activations will include nounish giveaways, interviews with event participants and spreading the Nouns meme in a variety of different ways based on the type of event. QR Codes, POAPs and social media analytics will be used to measure reach and provide more information attached to specific events/campaigns. For more examples of this type of OTG proliferation, please reference the Prop 110 Case Studies at the end of this Proposal. \n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß Nounifying Popular Social Events**\nAll events in pink above are social events. In addition to NFT/Crypto native events, NounsOTG will attend and Nounify prolific social events that are in alignment with Nouns branding and the larger brand recognition that we could obtain this year. These social events include Noun by NounWest, Nounchella, Cannes Film Festival, Tribeca Film Festival, Burning Noun and SXSW Sydney. For more examples of this type of OTG proliferation, please reference the Prop 110 Social Experiments at the end of this Proposal. \n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß Travel Costs - Flights & Accommodation**\nThese costs cover 2-3 airline tickets (depending on the size of the event) to events, insurance and checked bag fees. For each event, the travel expenses/airline ticket price was calculated with 10% added to the total cost to account for price changes over the next several weeks during the Proposal process. Accommodation is covered at each event for Aubtoshi and production crew members. For each event, the accommodation price was calculated with 10% added to the total cost to account for price changes over the next several weeks during the Proposal process.\n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß Transportation/Per Diem Costs**\nDuring OTG activations, costs accrue around each activation and social event including transportations or \"Uber costs\" as well as food for working team members, water and other toiletries or event supply items that might need to be purchased. An industry standard of $100 per diem per person on the ground covers these costs. These specific costs are calculated at the price of 2 individuals receiving per diem per day on the ground.\n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß SWAG - Merch & Giveaways & Activations**\nSWAG is anything that the NounsOTG team will be giving away as a brand tool during these activations. This includes stickers, T-shirts and other nounish items. NounsOTG has an ongoing relationship with builders in the DAO to ensure that these items come from builders who work within the ecosystem.\n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß Aubtoshi, Production & Administrative Costs**\nAubtoshi's payment for NounsOTG management on Prop 110 was $3,600 per month to manage 6 major events over 6 months. With the amount of events doubling on this Proposal, Aubtoshi's NounsOTG management and expertise to do so will double to ensure full time focus on each of these OTG events. Production costs are paid on a per event basis and cover capturing content while OTG, editing and distributing the content over the various OTG social media channels. Administrative costs cover the management of calendars, shipment tracking, live production schedule management, vendor coordination, and overall schedule and time management of NounsOTG events and activations.\n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß NounsOTG x Activations** All events in yellow above are the main activations. These 4 main OTG activations in 2023 are NFT Paris, ETH Denver, NFT Toronto and Burning Noun. NounsOTG has laid out the budget for each of these events below:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9rQ4QVu.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BU64XhJ.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FydwNMI.png)\n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß NFT Paris** is holding its second annual NFT event. After selling out a smaller venue last year, the team has more than doubled down with the iconic Grand Palais, which sits right across from the Eiffel Tower. John Hammon's successful nounish activation throughout Paris, France helped bring new crypto users to the forefront, all with their eye on attending this event. Aubtoshi is already approved as a speaker. Our budget would account for a shared Platinum Sponsorship with Poap.fr (same level as Ledger), items needed for a booth activation, a speaker slot and a budget to throw a smaller/more intimate activation to celebrate the end of this event. We will begin immediately implementing a production schedule of this event if this Proposal is successfully passed. ([event website](https://www.nftparis.xyz/))\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IM6GcVO.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CVVtO2L.png)\n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß ETH Denver** takes over the entire downtown Denver, Colorado area for a week to celebrate and educate event goers on NFTs, crypto and the web3 space in general. This event is known for having a jam packed daytime schedule with few social event options in the evening. NounsOTG has the opportunity to sponsor and produce an artist focused social event for 1-2 days during the event. The private location (think giant warehouse with open walls for artists) is on hold with nounish friends and we will begin immediately implementing a production schedule of this event if this Proposal is successfully passed. ([event website](https://www.ethdenver.com))\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M20WGMA.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/E9eLgNq.png)\n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß NFT Toronto** is another first annual event celebrating the increase in NFT and crypto native users in the Toronto, Canada area. One of the founders is involved with the Solana Nouns team and is determined for this event to be nounish. Budgets account for sponsorship opportunities and the chance to create a social, interactive nounish experience. *(website launching soon)*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tZGrDlw.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NuKAAhk.png)\n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß Burning Noun (Burning Man)** is an event known by people from around the world as one of the most dynamic and unique art festivals in existence. For one week, an entire city is formed with the center point being a wooden structure called \"The Man\". All attendees are encouraged to participate by creating art cars and wooden structures of their own that can be ceremoniously burned at the end of the event. We want to have a focus on Burning Man as a proof of concept for larger event participation in purely socially events. We will construct and burn a wooden effigy of Noun 0, releasing energies and paying homage to the origin Noun, while lighting the way towards the future of all Nouns. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CXxl9zG.png)\n\n**‚åê‚óß-‚óß NounsOTG Multi-sig (3/5 Signature)**\nThe NounsOTG Multi-sig will be a 3/5 signature multi-sig that will disperse funds on a monthly basis based on the timing of each event/prop.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 204 - Enabling a zero-fee NFT to NFT exchange for Nouns and beyond",
      "content": "# Enabling a zero-fee NFT to NFT exchange for Nouns and beyond\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-1.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-1.png)\n\n## Goal\n\nEnable zero-fee inter-collection trading/swaps for Nouns and Nouns derivatives while funding a self-sufficient tool for other collections to trade NFT to NFT.\n\n### Why?\n\nNoun ‚ÄúOTC‚Äù trading is currently inefficient in a web3 environment and is usually done in Discord or other social media. On-chain execution can be coordinated with an added layer of curation/search to simplify these otherwise complex trades. Interested in a noun for 100 lil nouns + 15ETH?  Looking to swap your punk for two nouns? Looking to pay additional WETH to trade your higher noun ID for a sub-100 ID? These trades can be posted to the atomic0 exchange with no fees, be executable by anyone, and can all be open at once until one of them is filled.\n\n**Today, there is no NFT-to-NFT exchange, only OTC trading tools. Nouns can enable this radically new style of trading, which is uniquely possible with NFTs while incentivizing Nouns proliferation.**\n\n## The proposal\n\nAcross the entire swap exchange experience, the benefits of Noun-involved trades are highlighted:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-2.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-2.png)\n\nThe atomic0 team will use funding from this proposal to meet the deliverables and timeline (below) **and guarantee zero-fee swaps where Nouns + derivatives are involved for the lifetime of the atomic0 exchange**. Where Nouns swaps are found throughout the experience, for example, on an individual punk page with a Noun-involved swap, the swap is highlighted as being a ‚ÄúNounish‚Äù zero-fee swap. Swaps comprised solely of non-Noun assets (BAYCs, Punks, etc.) will be subject to a 0.5% gross fee on the estimated value of the swap.\n\n### Implementation details and mocks\n\nIndividual punk page with an example of noun proposed bids/swaps:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-3.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-3.png)\n\nAsset selection:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-4.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-4.png)\n\nThe swap creation page post-asset selection:\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-5.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-5.png)\n\n### Considerations\n\n- **No fees, ever, where Noun or Noun derivatives are included in swaps for the lifetime of the exchange.**\n- An infinite number of swaps can be created (using Seaport) without the NFTs leaving your wallet until an order is filled.\n- Supports multi-sig ([Safe](https://safe.global/)) from day 1.\n- Opensea ‚ÄúMarked as stolen‚Äù support/warning.\n- The exchange utilizes Seaport (and the Opensea conduit, so no approvals, if approved on OS), and NFTs don‚Äôt leave your wallet until a swap is executed.\n- We **plan to bootstrap with Nouns DAO funding and provide benefits to the Nouns DAO with our no-fee swap product. We plan on a sustainable long-term roadmap via fees (0.5%) on other collections where Nouns are not involved in trades (e.g., Wrapped Punks to BAYC)**\n- Additional proposals/products are possible with fee distribution back to the treasury after we‚Äôve cut our teeth.\n- atomic0 is not yet VC-backed and is wholly founder-owned and operated.\n\n### Our Story with Nouns/web3\n\nWe launched a proof of concept zero-fee NFT marketplace which was the first on Ethereum to have both zero fees and [optional royalties (back in June)](https://twitter.com/atomic0Trade/status/1542282578291372032). Several Nouners used it to field OTC interest in their NFTs, but notably, [ayyybee used it to sell Noun #227](https://twitter.com/a0reverserekt/status/1565441676365029379), and [**vapeape (nounder) used it to sell his V1 Cryptopunk**](https://twitter.com/a0reverserekt/status/1563972653119025152). Many other traders and collectors in the space have executed trades on the platform, including [Franklin](https://twitter.com/franklinisbored/status/1574193716809662464), who actively lists his apes on [atomic0.com](https://atomic0.com/). While I don‚Äôt yet have a Noun, I‚Äôm [still closely watching and bidding on the auctions](https://twitter.com/robertjfclarke/status/1582833840447332353). Last month, we also built the [first WETH, non-custodial bidding solution for punks](https://twitter.com/atomic0Trade/status/1606001795985453057). This proposal was made possible with Noun delegations by [cryptopunks.eth](https://twitter.com/cryptopunks_ce) and [brennen.eth](https://twitter.com/brennen_eth). A big thank you to all the Nouns who gave feedback on this prop before it went on-chain!\n\n## Deliverables and timeline\n\n- Upon proposal execution ‚Üí Noun fees are removed on [atomic0.com](http://atomic0.com) for all Noun listings, including derivatives.\n- Four weeks from proposal execution ‚Üí Individual Noun to Noun or Noun to¬†Other 721 (wrapped punks, BAYC, etc.) swap creation/execution enabled.\n- Eight weeks from proposal execution ‚Üí Trait and ID array on the ‚Äúwant‚Äù side of trades enabled.\n- Stretch goal ‚Üí Automated recurring emails with the top swap offers received for your wallet.\n- Stretch goal ‚Üí Automated price adjustments and bulk swap creation when Seaport 1.2 is deployed on-chain.\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Why not build this as a stand-alone Nouns-specific website (e.g., nouns-swaps.com)?**\n\n- **We‚Äôve seen project-specific marketplaces come into the fold recently, such as [Apecoinmarketplace](https://www.apecoinmarketplace.com/collections/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d) and [nounish.market](https://www.nounish.market/collections/0x9c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc03). The utilization is near-zero compared with generalized marketplaces (Opensea, Looksrare, etc.). Embedding the aforementioned noun-specific benefits into the larger atomic0 swap ecosystem will incentivize and propagate nouns more than isolating noun swaps onto a Noun-only exchange. In other words, if people can also use the platform to trade their punks for apes, there‚Äôs a higher chance of Noun propagation due to incentives (no fees) for Noun-involved trades.**\n\nHow does this contrast with [Proposal 46 (Marketplace Pod Proposal)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/46)?\n\n- Our roadmap is entirely centered around enabling NFT to NFT trading, a stretch goal of proposal 46 ([noun.market](https://noun.market/)). Our deliverables focus on NFT to NFT, which makes for minimal overlap with [noun.market](http://noun.market)‚Äôs ETH to NFT focus. We see noun.market as complementary in some areas, including derivative identification for collection no-fee designation.\n\nWen open source?\n\n- We intend to open-source many components over time to allow for community contributions to the product, specifically on the front end. This will happen as we enable on-chain order creation and other helpful functionality throughout the development.\n\nHow does this contrast with existing OTC tools such as NFTTrader, Sudoswap OTC, and Swap Kiwi?\n\n- The websites mentioned above are great for situations where you‚Äôve already found a counterparty for your swap. For example, you own a Noun, have fielded interest on Discord, and have found someone to swap your Noun for a punk. We take it up a notch with an exchange-style format allowing you to field interest across many collections and NFTs simultaneously. You could make the same noun swap offer to 100 punks of your liking, all at once, and have them all open and executable on-chain until someone fills the swap. We also support trait, collection, and ID-array bids and have many added layers of discoverability for swaps.\n\n![https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-6.png](https://atomic0.com/images/external/nouns-prop-6.png)\n\nWill this require ongoing Nouns funding for maintenance?\n\n- Nouns support will sustain the platform's development through our roadmap mentioned above. Until fee-generating swaps from other collections, such as BAYC (where Nouns aren‚Äôt included), can sustain ongoing costs to operate the exchange. We may put through other proposals to add additional functionality or for long-term operational support, depending on community interest in the exchange.\n\nDo you have a plan for on-chain swap storage?\n\n- Off-chain swap storage is cheaper to implement and doesn‚Äôt require additional helper contracts, so we‚Äôre prioritizing them here for our MVP. We are open to implementing on-chain swap listings depending on the appetite, utilization, and community feedback. Fortunately, Seaport does allow for the storage of order hashes in their contract, so there is undoubtedly a path to implementation.\n\n## Team\n\n- [atomic0](https://twitter.com/atomic0trade)\n- [Robert](https://twitter.com/robertjfclarke) (co-founder)\n- [Alex](https://twitter.com/kiwi_dream) (co-founder)\n\n## Funding Logistics\n\n29 ETH to 0x12f3da22832ade66d63c624b8c40726db1124faf (atomic0.eth, a multisig controlled by Robert and Alex)",

They will be accessible through a fun and easy to use assembler. Ask is 24eth for both the art and the builder (+ bonus game integration!).\n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmcRAhGdyDTUY1dAzDcKiwWczAGHYL1pLzft1foDq4FrEo)\n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVL3NaTQyrecaGuawUscfT66mnjoFECDKBUoEUBQ34b5Z)\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Project details:**\n\nWith initial prototype and testing funded with Lil Nouns Prop House, I will create game-ready sprite sheets for each asset of the Nouns collection and make them accessible through an easy to use art and animation assembler (with a bonus Metaverse Game integration included for free!)\n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmZV2vRQvXx252dc73eLPrf4Fnz8N7MA8n8CytckSWPCSN)\n\nContent creators and builders will be able to use the sprite sheets for their own proposals/productions which will fast track development and reduce costs for each of those projects.\n\nThe creation of Sprite Sheets for an NFT collection is a massive amount of work in terms of art creation and file management. Having the Nouns collection available as sprite sheets will save future content creators and every 2D game project budget and time, not to mention the value of being able to prototype and launch quickly.\n\n ![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmRPdwYXeWgVAB6d3oUVTXK5yWtyRHsuXfA1apfP3L2Dyr)\n\n\nTo put it into perspective:\n\nIn total, the art for approximately 600 Nouns traits will be animated and/or assembled into sprite sheets (each of which consists of 128 frames), results in drawing approximately 76,800 individual frames.\n\nThe Meebits DAO created SpriteSheet assets to integrate Meebits into WorldWideWebb3. The DAO paid $60k for 697 traits (64 frames each/44,608 total) and the collection was completed in a total of 10 weeks. See their proposal below.\n\n([https://snapshot.org/#/meebitsdao.eth/proposal/0x7f1eac0510c868a00eae8082e258ea81a98f2dd310ec44bd9babcc752a787a0a](https://snapshot.org/#/meebitsdao.eth/proposal/0x7f1eac0510c868a00eae8082e258ea81a98f2dd310ec44bd9babcc752a787a0a))\n\nThat‚Äôs $60k dollars and months of production that each further project will be able to save.\n\nFurthermore, anyone will be able to build and animate any Noun they can imagine and export an animations of a them walking and idling in 4 different directions, as well as jumping and talking !     \n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmYFsy85wXRwsLwa8GsCTvHTXDt3A9m7CWLob6bfYPtzYo)\n\n\nMy ask is 24 ETH in funding for approximately 8 weeks of art and animated sprite sheet production (not including 8+ weeks of extended project pre-planning and prototyping with Lil Nouns Prop House 1466) and compensation for a website developer to build, integrate all Nouns assets, test and deploy the final builder website over the same period of time, not including final game integrations and fun extras.\n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPX1ugVD6un4cvMhp8jEbJdvPCMSZprqt7YnhRJxkwQgu)\n\nOnce the art is complete, I will work in collaboration with Worldwide Webb3 team, with whom I have already worked with before, to have the entire Nouns collection immediately integrated in their metaverse - with no additional cost added to the proposal.\n\n**Why WorldWide Web3?**\n\nThey are a web3 MMORPG and have currently integrated over 160+ NFT projects (over 1 million NFTs total), with 2 years of playtime across all users and 15k trades in-game. For the recent Halloweeb event there were ~5k new players and 10k unique ones.\n\nThis Nouns game asset integration will add zero costs to this proposal because the sprite sheets are integration-ready right off the bat (just need to host on IPFS). This will also allow for proliferation of Nouns for free via in-game user engagement and official game integration promotions on social media. All included for free.\n\n ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ycdsn6c.gif)\n\n**The Builder**\n\nI like to think of this Nounish assembler website as one of many stepping stones I‚Äôd like contribute towards the future of Nounish games, for game enjoyers as well as for game creators. A creative hub where multiple Nouns collections will be accessible (Lil Nouns, Food Nouns, Sound Nouns, Gnars, etc, etc).\n\nI have many things planned for the future of this builder: the ability to add your own traits and having a sprite sheet drawing app baked into the site to make Noun game asset development seamless. Eventually, I‚Äôd like to make this site a place where artists can come to draw, host, share, and support Nounish sprite sheet collections.\n\nSky is the limit with the future functionality of animated Nouns and this proposal represents the first step on the stairway to Nounish Sprite Sheet heaven!\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n**Deliverables**\n\n- Sprite sheet art for every asset of the nouns collection (424) with new traits (159+) , for walking, idle and jumping animations. That's approximately 76,800 individual frames!\n- A website where anyone can easily generate sprite sheets for their games, or preview and download animations for a noun. \n- Easy to use features such as a Randomise button, to generate unlimited animated nouns. \n- Two view modes on the builder: sprite sheet overview and animation preview.\n- Keyboard shortcuts (arrows to move, spacebar to jump) to test animations while in preview mode\n- A video introduction to sprite sheets and how to use them in games.\n- Immediate in Worldwide Webb in collaboration with their team as soon as the assets are finalized. Worldwide Webb team have been contacted and have confirmed that Nouns integration would be a top priority.\n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUhsjt2yKqaYMJzhy2XsGB9yiTUZc4Qr3sFodmrvstz9m)\n\n\n---\n\n\n**Why sprite sheets?** \n \n\nSprite sheets are used in games to animate the characters on the screen. They‚Äôre a collection of single frame animations, laid out like a film strip. The most common animations for sprite sheets are the idle sequence (character moving while standing still) and walking cycles (stylistic walk as the character moves around the map)\n \n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmRchwTteCEkNYPYD7xTwPb1iv8d1qh9T5yGpYtRZtDPpX)\n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPpQFPmP7mcrQGQt38XTNuH3rJXS7oUcaHCFL51M8jj8b)\n\n\n\nThis is an example of a pixel art sprite sheet created for Worldwide Web3 integration using a custom Dino Lil Nouns created with a Lil Nouns Sprite Sheet Builder Prototype\n\n\n**Additional Sprite Sheet Benefits:**\n\nAssets ready for use in future Nouns Community Game Jams or Hackathons\n\nAssets easily adaptable and integrated into many different game styles: endless runner (Chrome Browser Dino), 2D platformer (Mario Bros.), top-down (old School Zelda), pixel-based NFT/Metaverse integrations (Worldwide Webb/Turf/Nifty League Degens)\n\n\n___\n \n**Who is Kerimbonia?** (3D/Pixel Artist, Nouncillor)\n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/Qmd56XwRfzgirUobpywQDxd2hGqd6iXsMynzXz4g6wWsBj)\n\nNouncil Member, Lil Nouns Prop House 1466 ([https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-8/1466](https://prop.house/lil-nouns/round-8/1466) - funded), Noun Sounds Pixel Art Contributor\n\nI‚Äôm a professional 3D artist with over 20 years of experience.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 200 - Nouns Mail: A Token-Gated Email Address",
      "content": "# Nouns Mail: A Token-Gated Email Address\n\n_Thank you to Lakshman Sankar and Maksim Stepanenko for delegating Nouns to submit this proposal._\n\n_We would also like to thank Prop House and Nouns voters for their support in [Open Round 13](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round-13/2392). This proposal serves to update the community on our progress and request the remaining funds necessary for the development of Nouns Mail._\n\n## tl;dr\nA token-gated email address for every Nouns holder to pseudonymously communicate and access the rest of the internet.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DpLdRUv.jpg)\n\n\n## The Problem\n\nNouns is the most interesting experiment happening in decentralized governance and community. Yet, large swaths of the internet remain segregated from on-chain identities. Currently, Nouners cannot connect their Ethereum wallets to access Twitter, collaborate on a Figma document, or even engage on the [Nouns forum](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/).\n\nEmail addresses remain a necessity to access most platforms on the internet. Existing email providers do not natively integrate with Nouns identity, compelling Nouns to manually link aspects of their on-chain identity to off-chain platforms.\n\nWe elaborate more on this problem and discuss solutions in [The Identity Gap](https://app.skiff.com/docs/3e5c70ba-ce96-48fb-a6e7-be34b6e6c77e#tFlZDTabPylC4WiIdCQ+dRLfE2ZoWZ/uUrqBlx7cUUM=).\n\n## The Proposal\n\nEvery Nouns owner will be able to claim a unique, token-gated email address under `@nouns.email`, or another domain decided by the DAO. Claiming this email address will be enforced by querying to an Ethereum node verifying ownership of a Noun.\n\n**Use cases**\n\nHere we suggest four initial categories of how our proposal can provide utility for Nouns. Should the proposal be accepted, we hope to assist in building out these use cases ‚Äî like a weekly email newsletter or a `@nouns.email` domain-gated Figma.\n\nWe encourage the community to suggest additional use cases ‚Äî Nouns Mail is a primitive that can unlock a Cambrian explosion of creativity.\n\nGreater utility for owning a Noun (through Nouns Mail or otherwise) increases the demand for minting Nouns or paying royalties on secondary transactions, leading to a larger treasury for the DAO.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Egs08Y3.jpg)\n\n\n**Implementation**\n\nNounsDAO allocates a domain to be used as the official email domain for Nouns holders. We suggest `nouns.email` because of its familiarity, but any reasonable domain owned by the DAO or available on the market would suffice.\n\nWe will be using [Skiff Mail](https://skiff.com/mail), an open source, end-to-end encrypted mail provider, as the interface and mailserver for the custom domain.\n\nAll emails sent and received by Nouns email addresses are encrypted with elliptic curve crypto (Curve25519 keypairs), and emails that are sent or received to other Skiff accounts (e.g. other Nouns holders) are end-to-end encrypted. Ownership of EOAs is verified by generating a unique challenge token, requesting an ECSDA signature, and verifying the signature‚Äôs validity. A full description of Skiff‚Äôs protocol and threat model can be found at [skiff.com/whitepaper](https://skiff.com/whitepaper).\n\nAs previously mentioned, verification of Nouns ownership occur by querying an Ethereum indexer on the [Nouns token contract](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc03?a=0x0bc3807ec262cb779b38d65b38158acc3bfede10#code).\n\n**Example User Experience**\n\nA user connects their wallet ‚Äî if it‚Äôs detected that they own a Noun, a dialog prompts them to create their email address.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XIriCUL.png)\n\nAfter clicking `Claim email alias` , the page directs them to choose their unique Nouns email address.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DpLdRUv.jpg)\n\nAfterwards, Nouners will be free to send and receive email from this address.\n\n**Revoking Email Address Ownership**\n\nOne open question is what would happen to an account who sells or transfers his Noun after previously claiming his email address. Because owning a `@nouns.email` email address reflects one‚Äôs on-chain identity, it would be reasonable that ownership of this address is lost after losing the underlying Noun.\n\nTo implement this, Ethereum oracles on Skiff would listen for transactions where existing Noun email holders sell or transfer their last remaining Noun. Then, following an optional grace period, the email address would become disabled, becoming unusable until the account owns a Noun again.\n\n## Deliverables and Timeline (Post-PH Update)\n\n**Phase 1A: December 2022 [COMPLETED]**\nAfter Prop House Open Round 13, we successfully implemented the backend endpoints for Nouns Mail. You can view a video demo [here](https://app.skiff.com/docs/fc0a6f99-ebf3-4bfb-b724-6b70ee190103#XW5%2BD4uBTemlPZw4l3hmMaVlSn9npK4frGzDJQg8Bn0%3D) (this test account owns two other NFTs, but not a Nouns and therefore is unable to claim).\n\n**Phase 1B: January 2023**\n\nThe first phase will involve implementation of claiming Noun email addresses with the UX flow described above, including a full integration with the `@nouns.email` domain. We anticipate this taking around 2-3 weeks to fully build, test, and launch. Pending successful execution of the proposal, we are targeting a launch date of **January 20, 2022**.\n\n**Phase 3: February 2023**\n\nIn phase 2, we plan to take an active role in creating Nounish utilities based on Nouns Mail, including newsletters, domain-gated workspaces, and integrating better verification banners for the Nouns forum. We anticipate this process taking around a month, depending on the scope of utilities. We will launch these Nounish utilities as they are created, working actively with the community throughout development.\n\n## Team & Compensation\n\n[Joseph Zhang](https://twitter.com/trader___jo) - Designer, currently at Skiff and Azuki. Previously Apple, CMU design.\n\n[Richard Liu](https://twitter.com/richardyliu) - Engineer, currently at Skiff. Also contributor to IBC and Osmosis. Previously Blockchain@Berkeley, Figma.\n\nWe anticipate completion of phase 1 and 2, as well as initial maintenance and marketing, taking ~2 months. With one engineer and designer at a rate of 8 ETH per contributor per month, the cost of the [domain](https://nouns.email/) at ~3 ETH, minus the 1 ETH already awarded from Prop House, we are requesting **34 ETH**.\n\n\n**Revoking Email Address Ownership**\n\nOne open question is what would happen to an account who sells or transfers his Noun after previously claiming his email address.

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 199 - Distribute (some) Nouns Vision Glasses to Nouns holders (randomly)",
      "content": "# Distribute (some) Nouns Vision Glasses to Nouns holders (randomly)\n\nProp and code written by [DigitalOil.nftr](http://twitter.com/0xDigitalOil) with **‚ù§Ô∏è** for *Nouns DAO ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®*\nSpecial thanks to [solimander](https://twitter.com/_solimander_) for taking a look at the custom contract.  \n\n\n##Intro\n\n[Prop 57](https://nouns.wtf/vote/57) funded the creation of 8,250 pairs of luxury sunglasses made by [Nouns Vision](https://nounsvision.com/). Approximately 560 of those have been sold to individuals.*\n\n[Prop 185](https://nouns.wtf/vote/185), executed recently, assigned 150/500 Nouns Vision Glasses (GLASSES) held in the Nouns DAO Treasury to 3 different groups in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nThe aim of this prop is to distribute 50 of the remaining 350 unassigned GLASSES to Nouners. Each GLASSES is an NFT redeemable for an individual pair of physical glasses.\n\nA custom made site @ [nounsclaims.wtf](http://nounsclaims.wtf) and contract were developed for this prop.  \n\n\n\n# Proposal\n\nOver 550 Nouns have been minted. Given that only 350 GLASSES in the Nouns Treasury have not been earmarked, there aren‚Äôt enough GLASSES to assign one to each Noun. Assuming that there were at most 350 Nouners, GLASSES could be distributed 1:1 per Nouner, but such distribution wouldn‚Äôt be fair as some Nouners own a disproportionate number of Nouns and thus higher weight in control of assets in the Treasury.\n\nIn addition, it wouldn‚Äôt be wise to liquidate all GLASSES in the Treasury, as we might find another good use for them in the future.\n\nHence, this proposal allocates 50 GLASSES to be randomly assigned (with pro-rata probability) and claimable by wallets that hold Nouns at time of distribution. The contract was designed to allow for the creation of multiple claim rounds in order to protect against GLASSES staying unclaimed forever. The claim window was set to 15 days (108,000 blocks). After 15 days have passed, Nouns DAO can pass another prop to compensate for GLASSES that went unclaimed and distribute them randomly again, and even distribute additional GLASSES if desired.\n\n\n![Custom site deployed for this prop at nounsclaims.wtf](https://i.ibb.co/0CVKCGB/Screenshot-2022-12-30-at-1-08-03-PM.png)\n*Custom site deployed for this prop at nounsclaims.wtf*\n\n\n# Technical Details\n\nTo ensure the fairest distribution possible and to make it impossible to game the system, the source of randomness for the distribution algorithm comes from Chainlink‚Äôs Verifiable Random Function ([VRF](https://chain.link/vrf)) service. \n\nThe [Nouns DAO Executor](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10) contract was set as the owner of the deployed custom contract, so the distribution trigger can only be pulled by Nouns DAO.\n\nThis is the high level flow:\n\nVoting ‚Äî> Prop passes ‚Äî> Prop executes (**) ‚Äî> Function in NounsVisionVRFDistributor called\n\n‚Äî> Chainlink VRF random number requested \n\n‚Äî> VRF Coordinator calls back GLASSES distribution function in NounsVisionVRFDistributor\n\n‚Äî> Glasses are assigned to wallets that hold Nouns at that moment\n\n‚Äî> Noun-holding wallets can claim GLASSES won by the wallet for 15 days\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn addition to serving as a fun distribution mechanism for GLASSES in the treasury, this prop serves as a proof of concept for how other NFTs in the Treasury could be distributed if need-be in the future. \n\nIf this prop is well received and the DAO would like to distribute more than 50 additional GLASSES, I‚Äôll submit a new prop leveraging a more gas-optimized contract that can handle bigger allotments.\n\nAlthough I own 2 Nouns, given that I am not a guaranteed beneficiary of this prop, I will be voting in favor instead of abstaining because I‚Äôm interested in seeing the experiment play out.\n\nLet the **üé≤**¬†begin.\n\n\n(*) Total number of mints is ~1800; this includes 500 for Nouns DAO, 500 presumably reserved for the special edition disco noggles, and 250 for the team.*\n\n(**) This prop also makes use of the custom contract deployed for Prop 185 (NounsVisionBatchTransfer), made by [9999](https://twitter.com/lastpunk9999). Nouns DAO grants the NounsVisionVRFDistributor contract (custom contract for this prop) an allowance of 50 GLASSES on the NounsVisionBatchTransfer contract.",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 198 - THE NOUNSVITATIONAL: Tier 1 Esports Event!",
      "content": "# THE NOUNSVITATIONAL: Tier 1 Esports Event!\n\n*Nouns Esports is submitting this proposal on behalf of [Slacks](https://twitter.com/SirActionSlacks) & [Kyle](https://twitter.com/keepingitkyle) from WePlay Esports.* \n\n### Hello NounsDAO!\n\nWe are Weplay, a globally recognized Esports event company who specialize in creating groundbreaking productions in the world of gaming. From weekly shows with the NFL and top Twitch Streamers, to multi-million dollar Esports events such as the (Emmy Nominated) Dota 2  Animajor, we pride ourselves on making the most memorable and exciting events in Esports. \n\nNow, it's time for Nouns to have one of their very own: THE NOUNSVITATIONAL! \n\n## Please watch our short VIDEO PROPOSAL BELOW! \n\n\n\n[![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pet9rHvlNs](https://i.imgur.com/IQh4GII.png) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhwg_nlX-w)\n\n---\n\n \n Short and sweet: we believe that an Esports event can take Nouns to new heights. We don't want to just show people some Noggles and call it a day - We want to enact a 3 step mass integration program designed around introducing (and integrating) the esports public at large into Web3, Nouns communities, and furthering the Nouns mission.  \n \n \n \n### Introduction \n \n We first learned about Nouns after your fantastic Dota 2 team entered the scene, and we got to know a few of the amazing folks over at the Nouns Esports crew. After doing our research on Nouns, we were impressed to find a group of people who were different from the normal Dota 2 Esports sponsors. In a scene plagued by Betting Companies, Scam Coins, and other nefarious evil-doers, it was refreshing to find a group of people using Crypto in a positive way; One that we would be proud to partner with to spread their message. Weplay prides itself on being the best in our industry and working with the best in their industry, and we believe that this project would be one of those partnerships. \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/wb1Bub0.jpg)\n\n \n ### What we Offer\n \n What Nouns Proposals have been doing so far is great, but we believe we can do so much more for the growth of Nouns in the eyes of the general public. Many of your successfully executed Proposals in the past have focused on getting the brand of Nouns out there with general advertising methods of simply \"showing the brand\". What we offer is not only brand recognition, but brand integration, on a wide and universal scale. \n \nWe don't just want people to know what Noggles are. We want people to know about the Nouns mission, the point of a DAO, and to get people who have never heard of Crypto or NFT's (even people who actively dislike them) to see the Web3 world in a positive light by having them actively participate in a system designed around an event that we know they want to watch. \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ay6mRjf.jpg)\n\n \n  ### The 3 Step Plan \n  \n  Our idea is simple: get viewers to come for the Dota, and stay for the Nouns.  ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n  \n1. ENTERTAIN\n\nCreating a custom, interesting Dota Tournament structure with a dual purpose of getting as many viewers as possible to watch due to its innovative nature, world class teams, and Dota's best Talent while also subtly introducing them to a DAO structure in a positive way.\n\n2. EDUCATE\n\nOnce they come for the world class Dota, educate them about Nouns with direct, custom created content which Nouns can use forever (Nouns explainers, DAO explainers, Web3 explainers, and even mini-docs about past successful proposals and interviews) which we will play in-between the games to show that Nouns are one of the good guys, and that this system is something they can be a part of\n\n3. INTEGRATE\n\nUsing a POAP system, and focusing on a \"Mini Dota DAO\" designed around people who have no idea what Web3 is or don't even have crypto wallets, we aim to make the \"scary world of crypto\" something that viewers actively participate in both rewarding and fun as they collect Dota 2 themed POAPs during the event. By utilizing in-game systems, viewers can even trade these POAPs for digital cosmetics in Dota 2, giving them real value to the average viewer. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MgG6sMz.gif)\n\n\n  ### The Event\n\n\nThe Nounsvitational will be a world class five-day Dota 2 Tournament featuring ten of the top teams worldwide with the best broadcast talent in the Dota scene held from February 14th to February 18th. This will be a Tier 1 Dota 2 event, and the first LAN in DotA since the International World Championships in October. This will be the long-awaited return of Weplay to the Dota 2 scene (voted best Tournament Organizer in the scene, even surpassing Valve, the game's creator itself), and the first non-traditional Custom Game Mode LAN in several years. Suffice it to say, this event is going to be EXTREMELY hype for the average Dota viewer.\n\nUsing our custom map makers, we will transform the Dota 2 in-game map to be a Nounish playground, full of memes, references, and general Nouns branding so that millions of viewers will see Nouns during the games themselves. Between the games, we will utilize our content creation skills to produce and air custom Nouns video content, which will educate the viewers on Noun's culture, structure, mission, and past projects. \n\nHeld in the Weplay Studio in Los Angeles, we will bring the best teams around the world to play, and invite as many Nouners and Nounsfolk as we can to be part of the audience, for a once in a lifetime exclusive and intimate experience. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jO0BL0g.jpg)\n\n\n### Integrating the General Public to Web3\n\nThe event itself will get people's attention: they will watch for the unique structure and for the world class competition. But our true goal will be to get the viewers to understand and integrate into the Nouns culture while they watch a fantastic event. \n\nOur plan for this is also 3 fold. \n\n1. Traditional Pre-Event marketing of Giveaways, pushing people to join the Nouns Esports Discord, follow the Nouns Social media, and even give away tickets to attend the event live. Combined with the content we create at the event, we will ensure that people WANT to watch the content we provide, so they can understand the \"scary world of crypto\"\n2. Contacting the best artists and creators in Dota to make custom Dota 2 POAP art, which we will give away to viewers who watch the event. This will not only drive up viewership, but with an integrated system where viewers can trade POAPs for in game cosmetic items, chances to win prizes, and other benefits, we will not only subtly introduce the average viewer to the world of NFTs, we will ensure that they have fun doing it and can trade them for real value. \n3. Creating a \"Mini Dota DAO'' prior to the event, which will not only advertise the event during its duration on Reddit and other platforms, but show the general viewers that not all NFT and Web3 projects are \"bad guys\" and that the Nouns protocol is something that is actually cool, using a real tangible example that makes the Dota 2 community a better place. \n\nWe believe that by letting the viewers not just watch the Event, but actively participate in the event with POAP collecting, exchanging, and voting for how to \"better the world of Dota\" with a Nounish DAO system will achieve the greater purpose of the event. Come for the Dota, Stay for the Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DigBHGf.gif)\n\n### How does this Proposal Benefit Nouns? \n\n* All video content created for the event (the explanatory videos, documentary-like series, etc.) and the content from The Nounsvitational itself will be usable by the Nouns community as both \"proof of concepts\" and general media Nouns will be able to use forever. This media, especially explainer videos on what are Nouns, Web3, and DAOs, have great value for future proposal endeavors.  \n* Fantastic way to showcase current and past Nouns projects to first-time viewers in a captive audience. Can use already created media from other successful Proposals and expand on them with interviews from the people that made them happen\n* HUGE viewership and outreach to a variety of new, interested viewers in the world of Esports (a community that has a lot of crossover with Web3 already) in a positive, productive way in a scene that views other projects very negatively \n* Cements the Nouns brand in a very valuable space with tangible, easy to gather data showcasing sign ups, viewers, and active participants for future project proposals\n* Active (and trackable) onboarding of the general public to Web3 ideas and systems in a fun and dynamic way where they feel rewarded and positive about their experience, which is one of Noun's core goals   \n* Growing Nouns communities by incentivizing viewers to join for access to prizes, events, and other incentives along with getting them onboard with the general Nouns ecosystem\n* Come to LA! Nouns holders as well as Nouns community members can come and be part of the audience for the event, meet the players and the Talent, and have the experience of a lifetime! A great reward for your already amazing community members! \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RNEH3Tt.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/WmBYAjm.png)\n\n### Ask and Budget Breakdown\n\nTotal Budget: 799 ETH (at $1200) $958,800\n\nCategorized Breakdown:\n- Prizepool - 166 ETH / ~$200,000\n- Flights, Accommodation, Food for Teams: 171 ETH / $205,200\n- Mini Dota DAO Seeding - 10 ETH / $12,000\n- Customization of Dota 2 Map, In-Game integrations - 40 ETH / $48,000\n- Talent Fees - 55 ETH / $66,000\n- POAP Integrations - 7 ETH / $8400\n- VIP Experience for winning Nouners 10 ETH / $12,000\n- Complete Event Fulfillment (Production, Graphics Design, Stage, Venue, Content, Staffing, Security) - 340 ETH / $408000\n\nFunds would be received by a multi-sig (3/4) and then delivered to Weplay.\n- Brennen (Nouner)\n- Sasquatch (Nounsfolk)\n- Maty (Nounsfolk)\n- Kyle (Weplay Operator)\n\n### Event Timeline\n\nMedia Day: Feb 13\nGroup Stage: Feb 14-Feb 15\nPlayoffs: Feb 16-Feb 18\n\n### About Us\n\nWe are Kyle and Slacks, two prominent Dota 2 talent who also work at Weplay. SirActionSlacks has worked directly with Valve, the creators of Steam and Dota 2 in both Business Development and as an associate producer of The International, the Emmy award-winning 42 million dollar Dota 2 event since 2017. He has also created the only \"Alternate Game Mode\" events in Dota 2 history, including Midas Mode 1 and 2, Elimination Mode, The Captain's Draft Minor, and many others. While not making Dota 2 events, Slacks enjoys playing Dota 2 pubs and hosting/casting at events as Talent. \n\nKyle is also a Dota 2 Talent and former successful professional player who has been working to grow the world of Esports at Weplay behind the scenes on dynamic and groundbreaking productions such as the wildly successful Omega League and Dota 2 Animajor, an official Valve major. Kyle's brother was recently on the Nouns Esports team, and now ironically is on Slack's Dota 2 esports team. \n\nAs for Weplay, It's difficult to describe a company that prides itself on spectacle in a written format, so check out some of our content! \n\n[Augmented Reality Showreel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JvFmuPpaIXUCe8nDQiQLTX36HPdL9BoM/view)\n[2021 General Event Showreel](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JvFmuPpaIXUCe8nDQiQLTX36HPdL9BoM/view)\n\n### Thank you! \n\nAs we said, we are big fans of Nouns and everything you are trying to do in the space. We truly believe that this event will not only be incredible for Nouns, but also be a fantastic and unforgettable experience for the people in the Nouns community that join us live, virtually, and the Dota 2 community at large. We hope you will consider our proposal and would love to have any comments, feedback, and suggestions. We want to build this event for you, but also build it WITH you, to make sure we make it as NOUNISH AS POSSIBLE! \n\nThank you\n\nSlacks and Kyle\nWeplay Esports\n\n---\n\n## ADDITIONAL INFO\nStill looking for some more, condensed information? Then please continue reading!\n\n\n### On Dota 2 \n\nCurrently, Dota 2 is the 2nd most played game on Steam, the biggest gaming platform in the world. It reaches a global audience with millions of active players each day, and even more viewers on it's Esports events. \n\nCurrently, Dota 2 is experiencing a resurgence of the most viewers and players since 2013! \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ayuGSsx.png)\n\nWhile most Triple A games and Esports require multi-million dollar fee to enter into the sphere with licensing fees and IP protection, Valve allows anyone to do anything with their games, giving full mod tools to players. This allows us to create a very Nounish event for a game with one of the highest viewership numbers in all of Esports. This event would only be possible in Dota, and Dota is our specialty here at Weplay. \n\nIn terms of reach and scale of viewers, the numbers are hard to come by as China and Russia have viewership data that is not easily accessible, but viewership of top events (such as The International and the Weplay Animajor) can reach into the millions from the English audience alone. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NI7SdaC.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ViAaXH3.png)\n\nFor a full breakdown of the Viewership of Weplay's last event, please [check out this link](https://escharts.com/news/weplay-animajor-stats) \n\n### On the \"Mini Dota DAO\"\n\nWe know the mission of Nouns is to gather together and pool resources to make the world a better place. But, the concept of a DAO and the betterment of society that can be caused their-in is something completely foreign to most people. To help the viewers understand (and subtly advertise the event) we propose creating a \"Mini DAO,\" a system that is modeled after Nouns itself! \n\nThe process is simple. At the start of the event, we announce that we will take a percentage of the prize pool and allocate that money to \"make Dota 2 better.\" Then, we will start a Reddit thread (Dota 2's primary community hub) where people are able to offer suggested Proposals for how to spend that mon\n\n\n---\n\n\nRead the rest of the proposal at https://nouns.wtf/vote/198",

      "content": "# Finalize the Nouns 3D-Printed Fashion Collection & showcase it at NFT Paris\n\n[![e7e05fb06105c18df419d6355eba288412645d61.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/65gV8BNF/e7e05fb06105c18df419d6355eba288412645d61.gif)](https://postimg.cc/kBNRZ3Gy)\n\n### Summary\n* **Finish producing the DANIT PELEG x Nouns fashion collection as originally funded in Props 26 and 41**\n\t* The final collection includes 5 looks & accessories, all printed using various 3D-printed technologies (Polyjet, FDM, Jet Fusion).\n\t* All the looks will be wearable by real human models.\n* **Showcase the collection at NFT Paris, with more than 15,000 people expected to attend.**\n \t* The collection will be exhibited alongside the world's top luxury brands (Prada, LVMH, Farfetch, Lacoste, etc).\n\t* Top executives from the fashion industry will be among the attendees. Danit will introduce them to Nouns and tell them about the opportunity to build on top of the protocol.  \n\t* The collection's exhibition area is going to be a custom built interactive experience. It will include an AR installation and holograms representing the collection & Nouns.\n* **Showcase the collection in future events, museums, and galleries. Use this collection to introduce Nouns to new audiences.**\n\t* Danit will make the collection available to show in future events where Nouns have presence (like NFT NYC, NFT Aus, ETH Bogota/SF etc.)\n\t* Danit will (and has already started) introduce Nouns at her lectures in various events, e.g. at a recent workshop for executives at a very large luxury multinational corp.\n* **Who is Danit**?\n\t* Danit is one of the world's leading experts & innovators in 3D-printed clothes and textiles.\n\t* Her [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/danit_peleg_forget_shopping_soon_you_ll_download_your_new_clothes) received more than 2M views. \n\t* Danit's past work has been in the [Opening Ceremony of the 2016 Rio Paralympics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFEBaJWzER8), Triannale di Milano, Maker Faire, The National Center for Craft & Design, The Franklin Institute, Landesmuseum W√ºrttemberg Stuttgart.. and many more\n*  **This prop is for the last milestones of the Nouns 3D-printed collection. Here are the two past proposals:**\n\t* [Prop 26](https://nouns.wtf/vote/26)\n\t* [Prop 41](https://nouns.wtf/vote/41)\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n![isthisgood.gif](https://media.tenor.com/oN01aqzvhFwAAAAC/nounish-nouns-dao.gif)\n### Why should Nouns fund a 3D-printed fashion collection?\n\n*  3D-printed fashion is nascent and experimental. Not unlike Nouns, it's at the intersection of art, culture & tech. \n*  The tech being so new, and the visuals so striking, 3D-printed clothes and textiles get a lot of attention. The collection is eye-catching and different. It can be used to attract attention at various events. \n*  Fashion executives, especially in the innovation departments of big brands, are always on the lookout for the next thing. Through this collection nouns will stand out and help future potential brands learn about the opportunity to build on this open-source brand!\n* It's also just very nounish: pushing the boundaries of fashion in an authentic way.\n---\n\n### What does this proposal include?\n\n* Finish modeling and printing 5 looks.\n* Attending NFT Paris with a custom-built exhibition space, in a magnificent historic location, the Grand Palais.\n\n### Why combine finalizing the collection with the NFT Paris event? \n* Since it's physical, I want the collection to get exposure and eyeballs IRL. This event has the perfect audience and location. It is very fashion-oriented and is an NFT event.  \n\n\n### Progress since my last proposal:\n\n* Participated in the first [metaverse fashion week](https://twitter.com/danitpeleg3d/status/1508118881570897927) with the Nouns collection\n* 90% finished Patternmaking, Modeling, and Rendering all the looks.\n* Printed the first garment in Polyjet: the ‚Äúking‚Äù dress and assembled it.\n* Started making a special Nouns filament for printing with FDM tech.\n\n\n### Progress on Roadmap:\n\n1. ‚òë **Research** - Inspiration board, material research, printing samples\n2. ‚òë **Design** - sketches\n3. ‚òë **Patternmaking/Rendering/Modeling** - 3D modeling the sketches into 3D-printable files\n4. ‚òë **Print Testing** - testing many different types of printers, configurations, materials etc\n5. ‚òë **Participate in Metaverse Fashion Week (MVFW)**\n6. **STARTED: Printing finals** - printing the entire collection\n7. **STARTED: Assembling** - using different techniques (e.g. gluing, knotting, etc) to assemble the collection together\n8. **Photoshoot (with real-life models)** - for press materials, websites, AR filter etc\n9. **NEW: Showcase collection at NFT Paris** - Invited & will have a booth and interactive AR display\n10. **Marketing** - prepare press kit. The collection gets PR, is booked for events, and showcases galleries & museums\n\n## Some images from my progress:\n\n### The collection's sketches\n[![image-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/CKxgm5tJ/image-1.png)](https://postimg.cc/FY88KrhJ)\n\n### Washing the printed king dress\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-26-26.png](https://i.postimg.cc/hGYC7LSc/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-26-26.png)](https://postimg.cc/QBpg2W9y)\n\n[![image-2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/cCnpzndy/image-2.png)](https://postimg.cc/p5Pchy9q)\n\n### Assembling the top of this look\n\n[![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/rsPcrkgg/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/p5z3w3wn)\n\n\n---\n\n## Showcasing at NFT Paris\n\n### The event\n\n\n* [NFT Paris](https://www.nftparis.xyz/) will take place on February 24-25, 2023. A day before the start of Paris Fashion Week.\n* The event is taking place at the \"[Grand Palais √âph√©m√®re](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Palais_%C3%89ph%C3%A9m%C3%A8re)\", one of the most iconic locations for fashion in France (home of the most creative and artistic events in Europe, such as Art Basel Paris and all of Chanel fashion shows).\n* More than 15,000 people are expected to attend the event.\n* The event will bring together the biggest names of the industry and top-executives from major brands (Prada, LVMH, Farfetch, Lacoste, The Fabricant to name a few)\n* A large array of Fashion media outlets will be present and we hope will cover my story (Vogue, Artnet, Coindesk, Forbes, Elle, Journal du Luxe, Business of Fashion, Grazia‚Ä¶.).\n\n\n### The installation\n\n* Working with [Orbis](https://orbis-prod.fr/en/home-en/), a world-class creator of immersive and experiential spaces, we will showcase the 3d printed collection and the universe of Nouns.\n* The vision of this installation is to bring to life digital fashion pieces from the collection created by Danit Peleg, through different media: screens, AR, holograms, physical pieces. The installation will be segmented into different activations.\n\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-11-22-20.png](https://i.postimg.cc/4NRxnjtq/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-11-22-20.png)](https://postimg.cc/z3prctxF)\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-11-25-11.png](https://i.postimg.cc/fTVfTtcB/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-11-25-11.png)](https://postimg.cc/nCtD3LwD)\n\n\n\n1. **AR experience mannequin:** this centred piece will be used as a support for attendees to enjoy digital fashion pieces with Augmented Reality\n\n[![Screen-Recording-2022-12-19-at-11-29-52.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/rpzkh27h/Screen-Recording-2022-12-19-at-11-29-52.gif)](https://postimg.cc/xkrhChfH)\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-12-06.png](https://i.postimg.cc/LsxSd14P/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-12-06.png)](https://postimg.cc/zLH6K3gD)\n\n2. **LED 56cm fans:** these fans will create holographic fashion pieces from the collection\n\n\n[![fans.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/50QBc85K/fans.gif)](https://postimg.cc/LYRYLYbj)\n\n3. **POP3 holographic displays:** this digital display solution will recreate an entire digital fashion show by designing a digital catwalk on which both avatars and nouns will be brought to life\n\n[![pop3.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/jqN1PfVh/pop3.gif)](https://postimg.cc/PNXKkP5L)\n\n4. **Mannequin with physical fashion pieces:** this mannequin will be used as support to showcase printed pieces designed by Danit Peleg\n\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-10-07.png](https://i.postimg.cc/gJGxsRS6/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-10-07.png)](https://postimg.cc/mc6Z2cGb)\n\n5. **Video projector:** the screen will display videos from nounish ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®  (and hopefully a specific video made about my project) to share Nouns stories further and show the different steps of creation/production of the collection. \n\n\n### Additional activations\n\n* 15-minute session to present the collaboration with Nouns\n* 30 tickets to NFT Paris for the community\n\n\n## Budget\n* Finalizing & printing all models and photoshoot: 67,153‚Ç¨\n* NFT Paris & Booth Installation: 50,700‚Ç¨\n* Total ask: 125,457 USDC (117,853‚Ç¨)\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-10-15-31.png](https://i.postimg.cc/HLVtYQYC/Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-10-15-31.png)](https://postimg.cc/McJBtffs)\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-10-16-51.png](https://i.postimg.cc/66mtTKfJ/Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-10-16-51.png)](https://postimg.cc/6TnD1DPY)\n\n\n\n### Timeline\n1. **End of December:** Launch of production.\n3. **Early January:** Construction and assembly of the booth.\n4. **Mid January:** Marketing by NFT Paris.\n5. **January - February:** Finalize collection and photoshoot.\n6. **February 24-25:** NFT Paris!!\n\n\nI can't wait to finish my super nounish collection & bring it to awesome stages around the world!\n THANK YOU for your time and support!!! \n\n[Danit ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®](https://www.instagram.com/danitpeleg3d/)\n\n\nTransactions:\n\n* **To Danit's wallet: 72,547 USDC (68,353 Euro)** to 0x81EB3Fd07d84bD3aa0F4Df1359D87820F4cCbEf9 \n* **To NFT Paris wallet: 52,699 USDC (49,500 Euro)** to 0x48EeB021f2C56d4f8d2A741D2582A679B4C2B87A ",

This global game is NOT gambling. It‚Äôs a peer-to-peer platform where fans challenge each other to test their sports knowledge. It‚Äôs where trivia meets March Madness, but for every sport and every Nouner. Nouners will participate against each other in fun, easy, and simple-to-play daily contests across all major sports leagues. Here‚Äôs how to play:\n \n### Players join and get a free game credit. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/Je5UNvw.png)\n### Contesting will be available in major global sports leagues, with new leagues being added on demand.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LuODrnj.png)\n### Players choose a contest of their choice\n![](https://i.imgur.com/99eWvk7.png)\n### Players choose a winner of every game in the contest and earn points for each correct selection\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D3W6oIW.png) \n### The more points they earn the higher the prize\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yxWRgS4.png) \n\n\n# Proliferating The Nouns\nSports is a global passion, integrated within every Web2 and Web3 community. However, the bridge between these two groups has always been a challenge. When it comes to understanding Web3, Web2 users simply don‚Äôt know where to start. It‚Äôs up to Web3 projects to create resources that are immediately useful to them; Noun Sports Pick‚ÄôEm‚Ñ¢ is designed to do exactly that. This game cultivates an audience of Web2 sports fans in one place by providing a fun, inclusive, daily sports game.\n\nOnce the user has been registered, the game is designed to develop their interest in Web3, specifically the Nouns. In addition to the game‚Äôs Nouns branding, there are several key user journeys that will proliferate the Nouns.\n1.\t**NFT Prizes:** Many of the prizes will be NFTs and the dollar values will be shown. When Web2 users see the monetary value tied to the asset, they will be far more inclined to learn about NFTs. ***We will prioritize prizing from the Nouniverse ecosystem***\n2.\t**Nouns Updates:** Users will receive regular updates through e-mail and push notifications about other Nouns projects. There will be a page on the App where they can learn more about these projects.\n3.\t**Daily Facts:** Everyday there will be a brief Noun fact pop-up that users will see when they first open the App. Users can click ‚ÄúExplore Nouns‚Äù to be redirected to the Nouns Encyclopedia. \n4.\t**Weekly Voting:** Every week, users can vote on which prize they want the following week. Showing the various NFT utility (many of which will be sports related) will educate users on the Web3 space. On this page, users can click to learn more about the Nouns DAO and voting as well.\n5.\t**Nouns Encyclopedia:** Across the App there will be prompts for users to click ‚ÄúNouns Encyclopedia‚Äù which will be a complete guide to the Nouns. Users will be provided with direct links the Nouns native site\n\n### A subsection of the app titled ‚ÄúNouns Encyclopedia‚Äù will be a resource centre for players to learn about Nouns and NFT‚Äôs \n![](https://i.imgur.com/F7D7VjC.png)\n### In app messaging will provide players with interesting facts about the Nouns, Nouns DAO, and NFT‚Äôs \n![](https://i.imgur.com/7udQWRo.png)\n### Players will be notified on the app when a new Noun has been minted and provided with a redirect to the Nouns website to bid on future Nouns \n![](https://i.imgur.com/Stky4Ov.png)\n### Bounty will offer NFTs as contest grand prizes, and players will have the ability to vote on which NFT prize they‚Äôd like to play for \n![](https://i.imgur.com/ApqbmiW.png)\n\n\n# Our Team & Purpose:\n\nWe are Bounty Sports; a passionate group of sports fans who have worked tirelessly over the last two years to build Bounty.

Diversity in strategy ensures the diversity of the audience and maximum reach of the Nouns community. The marketing budget was determined so that Noun Sports Pick‚ÄôEm‚Ñ¢ can acquire 10,000 users in its first year and reach a total audience of over 57,000,000 sports fans globally. The campaigns will also include several Web3 influencers, events, and channels to acquire sports fans within the Web3 community as well. Marketing strategies include the following:\n\n1.\t**Influencers** (YouTube & Twitch)  - We will work with a vast network of YouTube / Twitch streamers (primarily e-sports and sporting news content creators) to promote Nouns Sports Pick‚ÄôEm‚Ñ¢ and migrate their audiences to the platform\n2.\t**Paid Media** ‚Äì We will run targeted interactive media ads via ad publishing networks\n3.\t**Podcasts** ‚Äì We will partner and become a staple on various sports centric and NFT-focused podcasts to grow the Nouns Sports Pick‚ÄôEm‚Ñ¢ brand reach and total impressions\n4.\t**Referral/Organic** ‚Äì We will develop a robust referral program, where Nouners and new players can refer their networks to earn game credits, prizes, tickets, and more\n5.\t **Conferences & Events** ‚Äì We will be an active participant at various NFT and Sports conferences alike, to deliver on the ground promotion of Nouns Sports Pick‚ÄôEm‚Ñ¢\n\n\n# **Monetization & Project Longevity**\n\nNouns Sports Pick‚ÄôEm‚Ñ¢ generates revenue by taking a 10% rake on paid contests, which allows the game to operate in perpetuity. Revenue generated will fund prizing and marketing in Year 2, and beyond. All excess funds will be used towards purchasing Nouns and other relevant sports NFTs, which will be layered in as additional prizes within the game. Bounty Sports is also committed to sponsoring other Nouners‚Äô projects to grow our own game and re-invest in the Noun community. \n\n\n\n# **FAQ About Proposal**\n\n**Q:** Is this sports betting?\n**A:** No! This game format is considered a ‚Äúgame of skill‚Äù. There is no ‚Äúhouse‚Äù, and all contests are run as peer-to-peer competitions. In essence, it‚Äôs a form of sports trivia. \n\n**Q:** Will Nouns Sports Pick‚ÄôEm‚Ñ¢ have e-sports?\n**A:** Absolutely. E-sports will be significant focus for Nouns Sports Pick‚ÄôEm‚Ñ¢, understanding it‚Äôs one of the shared bridges between Web2 and Web3 communities.\n\n**Q:** Is this a free-to-play (FTP) or pay-to-play (P2P) game?\n**A:** Both. To be inclusive and ensure everyone can play, the F2P game will be available globally. We will also offer a P2P game for users that want to compete with their own currency to win cash prizes. \n\n**Q:** How is the game monetized?\n**A:** The F2P game is not monetized, it‚Äôs FREE! The P2P game takes a 10% commission on the prize pool. For example: 100 users @ Œû 0.10 = Œû 9.00 prize pool + Œû 1.00 commission to Nouns Sports Pick‚ÄôEm‚Ñ¢. The commissions will go towards funding future F2P prizes and marketing, so the game will run in perpetuity!\n\n\n**Q:** Will the game accept crypto deposits & withdrawals?\n**A:** Of course!\n\n\n**Q:** Is this a Web2 game or a Web3 game?\n**A:** This is a Web2 game.

      "content": "# Atrium X Nouns - A Lore Experiment\n\n\n# Atrium X Nouns - A Lore Experiment\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZQDdQuJ.jpg)\n\n## Description:\n**TL,DR**\nWe are proposing to commission [Atrium](https://atrium.art/) & [3D Print Guy](https://twitter.com/3d_printguy) to create a cinematic 1:30-2min animated story introducing the World of Nouns. Bring the expertise of a Pixar veteran to the Nouns ecosystem enabling us to create a foundational animated short story & proliferate the meme!\n\n\n[Check out the proposal trailer!](https://twitter.com/3D_PrintGuy/status/1604906537184792576)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V58xsIR.jpg)\n\n**Wait, what is Atrium?**\nAtrium.art is a crypto-native network of independent artists and creators. Disciplines represented on Atrium currently include Screenwriting, Animation, Concept Art, Voice Actors, and Music production. Together, creatives on Atrium bring experience from Pixar, Marvel, Luma Pictures, Sony, Netflix and many more.\n\n> You can see the work of Artists on Atrium [here](https://atrium.art/)\n\nSimply put, Atrium is a way to easily piece together veteran talent to produce cinematic content.\n\n**So ‚Ä¶ What is this animated Lore?**\nNouns are cc0 identities coming forth one day at a time. While there have been explainer videos done via [113](https://nouns.wtf/vote/113) and open video content proposals (explainers) via [181](https://nouns.wtf/vote/181), We want to create an engaging cinematic introduction to the world of nouns. One that reflects the original intent behind the emergence of Nouns DAO, a story that shows who nouns are, what they have been up to, and a nod to future plans. A tale that leaves the audience curious, engaged, and wanting for more.\n\nWe believe this animation will serve as a foundation to build an expansive storyworld on top of nouns cc0 IP. Where any noun could go beyond the core nouns audience and have a viewership across different communities native to crypto and beyond.\n\n**Who is the creator behind this first story?**\nHaving a creator who understands the NFT space, the broader story, and cinematic culture is important when developing content to serve as a landing page for Nouns. We believe that 3D Print Guy is uniquely equipped in style, storytelling and understanding to provide a memorable rendition of the values and beliefs behind nouns.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rmzvlQT.jpg)\n\nWith over 2 decades of experience in the business, including working on films like Up, he has been tugging on your heart strings over many years. His youtube page has content eclipsing 45 million views and his characters and plots have shown the ability to capture the world‚Äôs attention. He has also demonstrated an ability to release relevant content based on trending topics as seen with his most recent animation about [ChatGPT](https://twitter.com/3D_PrintGuy/status/1600116597711990784) (5k+ likes, 77k+ video views on twitter).\n\nQuick Links about 3D Print Guy -\n\n[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/3DPrintGuyChannel)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/3D_PrintGuy)\n\nIn 2022 alone he has produced 15 min of animation both in longer formats and short viral clips, with sound design and VFX all done in house. In 2023, we hope to have the opportunity to help proliferate the nouns as well.\n\nSome of the Highlights of 3D Print Guy‚Äôs independent work\n\n[Imposter Origins: Among Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpCrmbP-Dfs&ab_channel=3DPrintGuy)\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/e/eea1fe1b1a05d83b75e4260ea6e9a44c654ae275_2_1264x514.jpeg)\n30+ mil views between Part 1 and Part 2\n\n[Sixstrings: Commissioned Non-canon BAYC Story](https://twitter.com/siixstrings/status/1554875246049722370)\n\n**Process at Atrium**\nThe entire process is a feedback loop. We would be creating a special channel on the Atrium discord server where Nouners are welcome to join and follow along the milestones of the process.\n\nWe would love to have at least one nounder to engage in conversation so that the story stays loosely true to the canon if any.\n\n* The workflow starts with defining the script and dialogs (if any) for the story. This involves defining shot by shot verbatim descriptions of what is happening on screen. A good story is a great script in the first step.\n* After the script is done, we start to look for Voice actors who will help narrate / engage in dialog based on the script. If the script doesn‚Äôt have any dialogs and is mostly visually expressive we skip this step.\n* Now the fun part begins where you start to model the characters, the environment, the objects in the scene. Rigging a model is technically intensive process and better rigged models are more equipped for better emotions during a scene (more fluid and organic movements)\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/e/e4408f0a1790f89fa248ea6aa9d233881580b665_2_522x518.jpeg)\n* Once you have the 3d assets ready - you start the process of Look-Dev. Look development in CG means you start to give definition to the model through textures, lighting, colours etc. They start to come to life.\n* Animatic essentially lets you block out part by part of the story sequence with actual scene setup (the animation is not smooth and done yet but essentially simulates the storyboard).\n* Using the animatic, Sound design can start to happen.\n* We will review the animatic and invite feedback to the animatic via our communication channel.\n* Once the animatic is locked down, the final animation work begins. This is the most intensive and time consuming process and takes the bulk of the later half of the creation cycle.\n* After final animation is done - it is time for last visual effects, lighting passes, refinements before you start to map out the finished sound design artefacts as well as the dialogs.\n* And then the final Reveal of the output (examples shared above). Final Output to premiere both on Twitter as well as youtube.\n\nWe will be utilising the Story‚Äôs reach in terms of reshares / likes / social engagement as metrics for success.\n\n**Ask / Cost**\n\nAll inclusive production cost is proposed to be 20 ETH. (Transferred to the Atrium Multi-sig upon execution)\n\nThings covered included\n\n* Storyboarding, Scripting\n* Multiple character plotline (3d Modelling)\n* In 3d animation, cost ramps up as you animate more than one character in a scene + dialog work\n* Voice Over + Sound design\n* Animation\n* Final FX\n\n> We will also be including the main characters 3d files (rigged) available for download and re-use under cc0.\n\n\n**Production Schedule**\nPost the proposal execution, we will look at a final production duration of about 6-8 weeks of the above process.\n\n\nWe will be coordinating the comms and logistics through out the whole process alongside 3dPrintGuy. Below are the team members involved:\n\n**Team at Atrium**\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/9/9687218ba0fd098bac4f63262303f4372d6943b2_2_1380x506.jpeg)\n* Supriyo - Founder | Atrium.art\n* Anaroth - Head of Community\n* Bri Ferraro - Artist and Collector Relations\n* Lasharna - Head of Marketing\n\n**The Future**\n\nAfter the first nouns story, based on the reception of the content launch and social signals, Atrium intends to come back with a larger proposal to fund n (undecided number) number of new original nouns Stories.\n\nThis will be Atrium‚Äôs take on creating an expanding anthology series centered around nounish lore where different creators from the Atrium ecosystem come together to build new characters with their backstories, lore and more.\n\nThis will be an interactive exercise where we will do a Casting call and participating creators / artists themselves make the decision on selecting casting call winners.",

      "content": "# Increase Voting Delay to 5 Days\n\nA proposal, when submitted to Nouns DAO, has to go through the following:\n\n - 2 days of Voting Delay\n - 5 days of Voting Period\n\nThis configuration was last updated in [Prop 161](https://nouns.wtf/vote/161).\n\nI propose we increase the voting delay to 5 days for the following reasons:\n\n - Gives the public more time to view, evaluate, and discuss props in public before big votes come in and sway opinions.\n - Gaurantees that weekly meetings will be able to discuss every prop no matter when it was submitted.\n - Gives DAOs and Communities with Nouns more time to organize the logistics of posting the props for discussion, holding an internal vote on it, and processing the vote on-chain.\n\njoel & krel",

([https://nouns.wtf/vote/137](https://nouns.wtf/vote/137)).\n\n#### In the past 6 months, we have: \n\n[(click on thumbnail to watch video)![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1561862008-6b0bb7f0c96ea6a1274f8d5a92c6e16018ac271a3dd958c59d0eb896f4a55a91-d?mw=1280&mh=720&q=70)](https://vimeo.com/778240986)\n\n\n\n[(click on thumbnail to watch video)![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1561868158-9fbf38c98875938a4a0f09cbdf0e51d1219ed3e43269276bed7e29f33808b89c-d?mw=1500&mh=845&q=70)](https://vimeo.com/778244189)\n\n\n\n[(click on thumbnail to watch video)![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/1561716804-3360feb04da9e29f78f85da2dc88f4110188ae47a4829b62956a480df34894fd-d?mw=700&mh=1244&q=70)](https://vimeo.com/778159366)\n\n### Problem Statement\n\nCharitable efforts, social impact, and public goods are **cornerstone activities within the Nouns ecosystem**.\n\nNounsDAO **has funded a total of 1468 ETH for 19 proposals** related to charitable efforts/social impact through on-chain, NSFW, and prop.house. *_Data from proposal.wtf_\n\nPublic goods are an **essential** part of what Nouns is, not only helping society but making the community feel even more connected with each other. **The desire to help others and make a positive impact on the world**, for many people, is **a way to connect with others and create a sense of community and shared purpose**.\n\n**What are the main problems?**\n-   Nouns has yet to have a platform that leverages all of these impacts done by the community, content creation opportunities are not seized.\n-   As Nouns keeps growing and more public goods are activated, the need for a flexible framework that produces raw content of charitable efforts, public goods, and donations is a must within the ecosystem.\n-   There should be a platform that gathers community members interested in social impact and public goods.\n\n**Social Impact is one of the best ways to show any human what Nouns can do**. The power that **see good, do good** content has is too big to let it go to waste. So far, Nouns has been one of the most successful projects at integrating IRL to web3 impact.\n\nShowing everyone how a community can come together to help others and cooperate with each other, **a community connected by ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®**, is an excellent way to noun-pill newcomers.\n\nThis is where _**Nouns Love**_ comes in.\n\n![nounslove](https://i.imgur.com/Zo86psu.png)\n\n### What is Nouns Love?\nNouns Love is born from the interest of the Mucho Love‚Äôs team to **develop a global platform that uses content from social impact, public goods, charitable efforts to leverage the expansion of Nouns through social media content creation and storytelling**. Nouns Love will focus on in-real-life impact activations and public goods generated by the Nounish community.\n\nThe power that **see good, do good** content has is too big to let it go to waste. So far, Nouns has been one of the most successful projects at integrating IRL to web3 impact.\n\n**Nouns Love will increase brand equity by building a positive association with the brand in a widespread audience**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4lw5YK7.jpg)\n\n### Transitioning to _Nouns Love_\nWe will start transitioning from Mucho Love to Nouns Love. Mucho Love will stay as a branch of Nouns Love for further social impact experimentation, public interaction, and testing ground of new ideas in the DR.\n\n**Nouns Love** aims to become a branch of Nouns that focuses on using storytelling, different narratives, and high-quality IRL content creation, which with the **see good, do good** content format **will expand Nouns to a global audience**.\n\nBy the end of the 4-month extension Nouns Love aims to be established as a fully functional platform.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5j9RvTb.jpg)\n\n### Mucho Love and international communities\nInternational communities will be using the model created by Mucho Love for its activations to test its adaptability. This will allow to take into account the inherent differences between countries, cultures, societal structures that exist throughout the world.\n\n**The communities that will test the model**:  \n‚ó® Uganda - led by Davin ([https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye))  \n‚ó® Mexico - led by Mono & Ale ([https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOAmigos))  \n‚ó® Germany - led by bk ([https://twitter.com/0xbk_](https://twitter.com/0xbk_))  \n‚ó® Spain - led by BlakeNeit ([https://twitter.com/blakeneit](https://twitter.com/blakeneit))\n\n**DR activations**:\n-   Knife RD x Mucho Love - ‚ÄúWe cooked 100 children‚Äôs dream meals‚Äù ([https://www.instagram.com/kniferd/](https://www.instagram.com/kniferd/))\n-   Giving an entire community free hair cuts and essentials\n-   @sunsetco.rd x Mucho Love - ‚ÄúWe took 10 families to see the beach for the first time‚Äù ([https://www.instagram.com/sunsetco.rd/](https://www.instagram.com/sunsetco.rd/))\n-   Techo RD x Mucho Love - [https://rd.techo.org/](https://rd.techo.org/) - Building a house for a family that lost it all to Hurricane Fiona\n-   Hugo Mendoza Children‚Äôs Hospital x Mucho Love ([https://hospitalhugomendoza.gob.do/](https://hospitalhugomendoza.gob.do/))\n\n**International activations**:\n-   A refugee dedicated to preserving the endangered Mexican donkey\n-   A volunteering event that will hand out food to homeless people around the city.\n-   A child care center for orphans and abandoned children to donate clothes, nounish educational materials such as books and pencils, toys, and dry stock food hampers.\n-   A city clean-up activation volunteering event.\n\n### Content creation and distribution\n**Every public good, social impact, and charitable effort has a unique narrative**. Through storytelling, all of these narrative can portray what it means to be nounish. Nouns Love will have its own in-house marketing team **to develop unique narratives through captivating, ‚Äúsee good, do good‚Äù style videos**.\n\n**The amount of raw content that can be produced from public goods, charitable efforts, social impact is immense**. The marketing team will receive raw content to produce high-quality content for social media distribution. The team will have constant brainstorming sessions with international community leads to deeply understand the particular narratives of every activation done.\n\nContent creation was one of the biggest challenges that Mucho Love faced, not having our own team that could develop our ideas, concepts, and styles was a huge limiting factor on our social media content capacity. **NL‚Äôs in-house team will allow us to 5x our content creation capabilities**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZjHKKHM.jpg)\n\n### Development of a flexible framework\nDuring the past 6 months of activations, Mucho Love has made mistakes, created solutions, and changed formats. The amount of time lost by Mucho Love‚Äôs starting inefficiencies is very significant. Time-efficiency is the reason why we decided to develop a flexible framework for public goods, charitable efforts, and social impact.\n\n**A flexible framework that allows for better, smoother activations, therefore saving time.** The framework will take into account many minor details that may be overlooked which can lead to a poor activation and overall experience.\n\n**This framework will be tested by our international communities** that will be performing social impact activations during the following 4 months.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UvXE2KN.png)\n\n### Global synchronous activations\n**A global synchronous activation is an activity performed by many different communities that form the Nounish ecosystem in a certain time period**. These activations will target the same issue/activity and produce raw content for content creation.\n\nBy providing a platform for people to connect and interact in real time, global synchronous activities **can help to build relationships and foster a sense of belonging among members of a community**.\n\n**Nouns Love aims to portray the amazing work being done by nounish communities all around the world**. With storytelling, content creation, narratives, and marketing allowing Nouns to reach a wide audience.\n\nBy removing all barriers of crypto, web3, creating a wallet, discord, different websites, twitter, **see good, do good content** will be able to transcend as far as many hearts it touches in its path. Additionally, global synchronous activities will help build momentum and enthusiasm for a particular cause or issue, driving up engagement and participation within the community.\n\n### Social media & content distribution\n**We aim to expand Nouns Love to**:  \n‚ó® Youtube: Mid-length video format striving to combine storytelling with good animations, edits, and clips that will lead to the production of family-friendly, shareable, ‚Äúsee good, do good.‚Äù content.  \n‚ó® Tiktok: Short video formats with catchy hooks with the main point of spreading the ‚åê‚óß-‚óßs through the platform. Making it easier for people who find the ‚åê‚óß-‚óßs interesting to click the profile and access other social media where more information will be more easily found (Instagram, Youtube).  \n‚ó® Instagram: So far, Instagram has worked for us pretty well. A few flops and one fantastic post (a post with 67,000 likes), but it‚Äôs been great in general. Instagram will be the ‚Äúface‚Äù of what NL stands for, does, and activates. We‚Äôll also be using challenge formats to engage more people.  \n‚ó® Twitter: We‚Äôll be using Twitter to make updates like ‚ÄúToday, Nouns Love donated 100 football kits powered by ‚åê‚óß-‚óß‚Äù.\n\n**Combining youtube‚Äôs storytelling capabilities through mid-length content that engages viewers, TikTok‚Äôs short-form video with hooks that captivate the attention to the noggles, and Instagram as the face of NL, we believe that it‚Äôll be only a matter of time & effort for us to reach substantially good levels in all these platforms**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/a7I8VN1.jpg)\n\n### Budget Breakdown\n\n#### Social Impact Fund 84 ETH\n\n-   5 activations in the Dominican Republic (Mucho Love) (46.5 ETH)\n    -   Transportation, uniforms, volunteers activity, and third parties (6.5 ETH)\n-   4 pilot activations by international communities (16 ETH)\n-   1 synchronous international activation in all 5 countries (15 ETH)\n\n#### Marketing & Content Creation Team 39 ETH\n-   Video Editor\n-   Social Media Manager\n-   Animator/Illustrator\n-   Photographer/Videographer\n\n#### 16 ETH\n-   Retro-funding compensation for 4 core team members who have worked on Mucho Love for the last four months.

Similar to how the DAO added in [new head attributes](https://nouns.wtf/vote/125) via a proposal, Nouns can continue to explore and experiment with new models of CC0 art and production and minting directly from the DAO is a new tool for the organization to directly release and distribute the most important artifacts from the community. It‚Äôs not hard to see how this can advance Nouns into a crypto-native form of Movie Studio, Production House, Art Museum and so on.\n\nThis video will be released as a Timed Open Edition for a price of 0.05 ETH. This means it will be available for anyone to mint for the specified minting period, which will be open until the Rose Parade on January 2nd, 2023. The proceeds from sale will be split between Nouns (60%) and Ordinary Folk (40%).\n\nWe are excited to experiment with DAO NFT releases as an additional value capture mechanism, and potentially create a simple and repeatable model for any creator, community and brand in the ecosystem to put forward amazing artifacts to be minted via Nouns.\n\nThis edition will be minted with [Zora](https://zora.co), and will be available to mint onchain and at [thisisnouns.wtf](https://thisisnouns.wtf)\n\n# Release Details:\n\n**Title:** This is Nouns\n\n**Description:** WTF is Nouns? That‚Äôs the question we sought to answer in this crazy video ‚Äì packing in more artistic styles than we‚Äôve ever put into a project before, and a sprinkling of humour along the way.\n\nThis is Nouns is the first ever edition mint by NounsDAO, created by Ordinary Folk.\n\n‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® \n\n**Symbol:** NOUN001\n\n**Edition Type:** Timed Open Edition\n\n**Start date:** December 23rd, 12pm ET \n**End date:** January 2nd, 12pm ET\n\n**Price:** 0.05 ETH\n\n**Split address:**\n0xCF8AEFd3E895005C37BB7A901C1a8B253684A012\n\n**Ordinary Folk Address**\n0x93629A45bB87C4518cB98Dbd97e016136e89Ce71\n\n**NounsDAO Treasury Address**\n0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10\n\n---\n###### *tranqui.eth (ZORA engineer) is set as collection defaultAdmin to update any potentially issues with metadata + salesConfig upon contract deploy and will then transfer ownership to NounsDAO Treasury Address when finalized.*",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 187 - Nouns CC0 Animation Generator & Interactive App",
      "content": "# Nouns CC0 Animation Generator & Interactive App\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iFxuOIn.gif)![](https://i.imgur.com/KG0Tk59.gif)![](https://i.imgur.com/TZkJ9bL.gif)\n\n## TL;DR\n\nWe‚Äôre aiming to bring Nouns to life by animating all Nouns assets as public goods for cc0 use. We'll build tools for users to generate & access their own animations quickly and easily for use in any project. There's 20 unique and thoughtfully crafted animations to choose from with over 467,000,000 possible animation outcomes.\n\n* Through a front-end app, anyone can enter a Noun ID or mix and match traits to create their own custom Noun and export animations on the spot.\n* Developers will be able to programmatically access any of these animations instantly and seamlessly through an API and/or a URL.\n* Interact with your Noun (including custom ones) through an interactive app on a daily basis with actions like eating, sleeping, playing, and more! The status of each Noun will change throughout the day and you can tend to it accordingly to keep it alive, happy, and healthy.\n\n## Introduction & Background\n---\nHello Everyone,\n\nI'm Jeff (aka heyjeff.eth, jefe) and I‚Äôve been developing an app over the past year that aims to engage NFT collectors by bringing their NFTs to life. Quick backstory:\n\nThe concept was inspired by the popular Japanese phenomenon ‚ÄòTamagotchi‚Äô released in the late 90‚Äôs. Each handheld device contains a virtual friend the user must tend to in order to keep it alive, happy, and healthy. Interestingly enough, it‚Äôs a style of game that you don‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äòbeat‚Äô or ‚Äòwin‚Äô. It‚Äôs more of an experience of having a buddy that you can play with, care for, and watch grow throughout it‚Äôs lifespan, forever.\n\nI thought it‚Äôd be fun if people could do the same with their NFTs, so I decided to build a prototype. At first it started out as just a silly napkin sketch, but now we‚Äôre proud to say we‚Äôve recently finished adding support for all 6,969 CrypToadz, each with 11 unique animations totaling over 75,000 files! *(That‚Äôs 7.6 GB of raw toad data)*. For those who own a CrypToad, you can check out the app [here](https://tinycitizen.xyz).\n\nHere‚Äôs some footage:\n[![CrypToadz Gameplay](https://i.imgur.com/KHs4MZi.png)](https://vimeo.com/780511900)\n\n\n## Motivation and Goals\n---\nWhat we‚Äôre aiming to do is leverage the tech we‚Äôve developed for CrypToadz and adapt it to build tools so that anyone can generate, access, and download Nounish animations on demand for cc0 use.\n\nTo do this, we‚Äôll develop an easy-to-use Build-a-Noun app through which anyone can choose a pre-existing Noun or build their own by mixing and matching traits at will or at random. Users will be able to preview animations on the fly and then instantly download any or all of the animations they like, with the option of exporting the individual animation frames as well. The app is future-proofed too, so every Noun that is born each day will be readily accessible.\n\nNot only that, but any animation for any Noun configuration can be easily accessible via a back-end API and/or a URL for developers to use in their web apps instantly and seamlessly.\n\nAs an added bonus, anyone can immediately interact and play with their Noun or custom Noun through our other interactive app we‚Äôve already built!\n\nUltimately, the goal of all of this is to empower people to actively use Nouns in engaging, refreshing, and easy ways to help spread the meme.\n\n## Build-A-Noun App, prototype & poc\n(early prototype shown, does not represent final product)\n[![Build-A-Noun Prototype](https://i.imgur.com/Viv5UfU.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/777492078)\n\nThe 20 total actions and states are: idle (breathing/blinking), happy/loved, laughing, talking, dancing/head bob, eating: pizza, mushroom, veggies, fruit, hamburger, playing a gameboy, sad/crying, drinking: coffee, water, tea, health/mana potion, tired, sick, and sleeping.\n\nThe above is an early prototype solely to convey the concept of the Build-A-Noun app. The final product will have a redesigned and intuitive interface, with way more options and functionality, such as:\n* Select transparent or any background color (hex or rbg input)\n* Quick select any existing Noun ID config\n* Searchable traits by ID or name\n* Randomize traits button\n* Flip the animation (left-facing vs right-facing)\n* Change output animation speed\n* Apply an rbg tint to the animation\n* Apply a black and white filter to the animation\n* Resize animation to specific dimensions\n* Export all individual frames for a given animation\n* Pick and choose which animations to export\n* Add text overlays\n* Share-to-Twitter button to quickly tweet your creations \n\nFlipped![](https://i.imgur.com/bIxYeRQ.gif) B/w filter![](https://i.imgur.com/eI9okhg.gif)\nrbg(255, 5, 555) tint![](https://i.imgur.com/1n2f2xY.gif) Sped up 3x![](https://i.imgur.com/FsMU13t.gif) Flipped, 0.75x speed, rbg(293, 65, 5) tint![](https://i.imgur.com/AaLiqTR.gif)\n\n\n*Examples of animation customization options*\n\nIn total, we‚Äôd pre-generate 8,700 animation files (435 Nouns assets x 20 unique states), each with an average of 30 frames per animation. That's  a total of 261,000 individual frames to bring this vision to life! There are 23,377,200 possible combinations for a Noun, and 467,544,00 possible animations outcomes (23,377,200 x 20)!\n\n\n## Why?\n---\nCurrently, there isn't a scalable tool in the Nouniverse that allows users to quickly produce a wide range of highly customizable Nounish cc0 animations on demand.\n\nGame developers, content creators, and everyday users can benefit from such a tool as a building block to create even bigger and more Nounish things!\n\nWe're trying to fill this gap in the Nounscape by providing STOMMs (*Super Tool of Mass-Memeification*) in an area that is lacking. With this tool in place, I believe we'll see an explosion of new Nounish content for everyone to use and enjoy as they see fit.\n\nPlus, being able to interact with your Noun deepens our emotional connection to them!\n\n## Sneak Peeks\n---\nWe made the following animations for Lil Nouns for fun as a test, but the same concepts apply for Nouns. Here's a peek at 10 out of the 20 total states. Choose any background color you like, or none at all (transparent).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/u0ZdEUw.gif)\nIdle\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/p9ecpWa.gif)\nEating pizza\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ygk8hBI.gif)\nSleeping\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/euvT8qO.gif)\nPlaying Gameboy\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CqHr6cL.gif)\nHappy\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Wnxg4Uj.gif)\nSad/Crying\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1TBwth1.gif)\nDrinking coffee\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LmXiVcz.gif)\nSick\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qbxc4Wy.gif)\nTired\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oIWI1F3.gif)\nHealth potion\n\n## Interactive App ~ Bonus ~\n---\nAnyone who owns a Noun or builds one with our Noun Builder app can interact with it on a daily basis through an app we've already built (works on mobile too)! Each Noun will be animated to reflect it's current state or action - it will truly feel like your Noun has come to life!\n\nHere are the following mechanics:\n\n4 Stats (each max val of 100):\n* Fullness\n* Energy\n* Happiness\n* Health\n\n3 Player Actions (each grants XP needed in order to level up):\n* Feeding ‚Äì Increases fullness and happiness\n* Sleeping ‚Äì Increases energy and health\n* Playing ‚Äì Increases happiness, decreases fullness and energy\n\n3 Conditions:\n* Can‚Äôt sleep while starving\n* Can‚Äôt play while sleep-deprived\n* Can‚Äôt eat while sick\n\n3 Items (purchasable with points earned from completing actions)\n* Coffee ‚Äì Triples the amount of XP gained, but cannot sleep for 8 hr\n* Health Potion ‚Äì Replenishes health to full\n* Mushroom (can be easily reskinned to another object) ‚Äì 1 of 4 potential effects, chosen at random:\n    * Jumbles stats at random\n    * Earn a random amount of XP\n    * Gain 1 level\n    * Eat a poisonous mushroom and die\n* All stats decay by 2 every 4 hours automatically, forever\n* Sometimes, at random, 1 of the 4 stats will be depleted to zero if all stats are non-zero\n* If neglected for ~8 days, the NFT will die\n* NFTs can be revived, but lose 1 level and costs points\n* Highest levels are ranked in a public leaderboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PaRnHTs.gif)\n*Nounish interactive gameplay demo (limited features)*\n\n\n## How is this valuable to Nouns??\n---\n\n### 1. Public Goods & Network Effects\n\nEveryone from experienced devs to everyday users will be able to generate & access Nounish animations on demand, either through the API or the front-end tool within a few clicks.\n\nThis means anyone -- enthusiasts, developers, and/or content creators can save countless hours by bootstrapping these animations to be used any way they like! Some examples include: \n\n* Enrich existing apps or websites\n* Use as stickers and/or emojis for Discord servers\n* Use the animations to develop a game\n* Use them to make merch and/or NFTs\n* Enhance Nounish media like tweets, infographics, or videos\n* Use as pfps\n* Download the individual animation frames to make sprite sheets\n* Use the frame data to create lip-synced animated avatars for video/audio calls\n\n-- the possibilities are endless!\n\nThe end result will lead to quicker turnarounds for prototypes and media creations, and act as a catalyst for the proliferation of new Nounish content overall.\n\nQuote from devcarrot, Nounder:\n\"This sounds like a very fun idea, I love the animations. Would you be willing to make the data accessible to other developers via a public API? Maybe with something like a license that requires attribution? It could be interesting to have Nounish characters hanging out on the various projects‚Äô sites; imagine Timpers‚Äô disco floor but with TinyCitizen characters rendered in real time.\n\nThe disco floor:\n![](https://cdck-file-uploads-europe1.s3.dualstack.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/a/a30c42ece4e30f7f4aac00f6979b82a057b19eb9.gif)\"\n\n\n### 2. Rally community around organic and fun reward systems\n\nThrough the interactive app we‚Äôve already built, it provides opportunities for users to earn rewards through quests.\n\nAs an example, we‚Äôve successfully rewarded 80+ unique CrypToadz players with a CrypToadz hat and pair of Nouns glasses to those who reached level 10 with a CrypToad through the interactive app. Everyone shared how much they loved this event!\n\nThis provides a more rewarding experience because the merch drop felt earned rather than simply given. In turn, it promotes camaraderie and a sense of fellowship among the community who want to achieve a mutual desired result by partaking in shared experiences.\n\nAny Nounish DAO that wishes to engage their audience can task their community with completing certain actions through the app and granting them an award upon completion.\n\n**Reward bundle: CrypToadz Hat + Noun Glasses + NFT NYC Coaster**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xupiot6.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f8PToWz.jpg)\n\n*pssst‚Ä¶ This event is still ongoing! If you want a CrypToadz hat and Nouns glasses you can still grind for them! Find me on Discord :wink:*\n\n### 3. Tap into & activate new creators and builders\nIf we make these assets readily available for people to access in an engaging and easy manner, it could open up doors for new people to enter the ecosystem.\n\nThose that need assets to build on Nouns in new or interesting ways but have no developer or animation experience can often feel discouraged not knowing where to start.\n\nWith the Build-A-Noun app as a building block, we can inspire existing Nounish community members as well as potential new ones to create something Nounish easily and quickly. Anyone can get up and running with tens, hundreds, or thousands of animations ready to use within minutes.\n\n\n## Deliverables\n---\n* Create an easy-to-use front-end tool + website where anyone can create and download unique cc0 gifs for any Noun configuration on the spot. The 20 unique states/actions are:\n    * Idle (breathing + blinking)\n    * Happy/Loved\n    * Sad/Crying\n    * Laughing\n    * Talking\n    * Sleeping\n    * Dancing/Head bob\n    * Eating\n        * pizza\n        * mushroom\n        * fruit\n        * veggies\n        * hamburger\n    * Drinking\n        * coffee\n        * water\n        * tea\n        * health potion\n        * mana potion\n    * Playing a gameboy\n    * Tired\n    * Sick\n* Create a back-end API, where anyone can instantly grab any animation for any Noun configuration for use in their web apps programmatically via an API key and/or a URL\n* Revamped front-end design with mobile-friendly version to generate animations on the go!\n* Integration with our existing free-to-play side-app where users can interact and play with their Nouns (already built)\n* Publicly host the raw base64 encoded png frame data for all Nouns assets in json format so anyone can use the animation frames how they like\n\n## Timeline\n---\n### Total: 10 weeks\n\nEach individual trait needs to be manually animated for all 20 states. That's roughly ~1,000 files per week (435 x 20 / 8). Some take shorter than others because they're static in a given animation, or they mimic the same motion as another animation and can be ported. Regardless, there is a lot of upfront work to be done.\n\n### Weeks 1-4:\nFront-end work, complete site redesign and development. Mobile-friendly optimization. Developing gif creation software with various customization options.\n\n~50% of animations files complete\n\n### Weeks 5-8:\nBack-end work on API creation. Work on image processing and manipulating animation frame data. Create hosting solution for animation data.\n\n~100% of animation files complete\n\n### Weeks 9 & 10:\nHook-up back-end to front-end. Allow 2 week buffer for testing & bug fixes, or any last minute optimizations/improvements.\n\n## Who we are\n---\n![](https://i.imgur.com/EkzLRN9.gif)**heyjeff.eth** - Full-Stack Dev / Design / Vision / Logistics\n\nI‚Äôm an engineer, problem-solver, and purveyor of ideas that I believe are worth telling.\n\nI've been involved in the NFT space since early 2021 and became Noun-pilled a couple months ago through some people I‚Äôve me\n\n\n---\n\n\nRead the rest of the proposal at https://nouns.wtf/vote/187",

Ultimately empowering action sportspeople to uplift their communities with the first \"never-ending [expression session](https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/the-history-of-the-expression-session-in-surfing).\"\n\n*ie.

We've [sponsored over a dozen](https://gnars.com/riders) skateboarders, snowboarders, surfers, scooter riders, inline skaters, roller skaters, skiers and an entire motorcycle club.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/0DCX8jK.jpg)](https://twitter.com/nounish/status/1569692294529581056)\n\n[Since receiving 69 ETH to get started](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51) just 7 months ago, we've attracted millions of views on our nounish content, caught the attention of industry icons such as [Bob Burnquist](https://www.instagram.com/bobburnquist/) and have been onboarding people in *extremely nounish ways, like these 1.5M views with [Tom Rohrer](https://www.instagram.com/toms_tutorials/):*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QkY1C9e.jpg)\n\nMost recently we've been making a splash in Brazil thanks to our involvement with I LOVE XV, an annual skateboarding event in its 10th year. With [a budget of just 6 ETH](https://gnars.house/proposals/0xb63306dbfe950dd9754d5edcf8f48c6ff9bdd32eeeff4c644cb90c974a3055fa) those involved brought together 1000+ skaters in Rio de Janeiro to shred the biggest noggles ever made:\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/656PzQ6.jpg)](https://twitter.com/nounish/status/1593765220425486337)\n\nNot only did they produce terabytes of incredible content, our Brazilian crew provided the inspiration for this proposal. We learned that instead of just sponsoring individuals, we should empower them to uplift their communities as a whole:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JLwvCJb.jpg)\n\nNow we're an internet collective of over 750 members ready to actualise our subculture's rendition of the \"nouns virtuous cycle.\" We will establish the first \"never-ending [expression session](https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/the-history-of-the-expression-session-in-surfing)\" to power our CC0 media machine.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aObap4q.gif)\n\nGnars have funded [over 30 proposals](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth), submitted the [first nounish DAO to DAO proposal](https://nouns.wtf/vote/142) ([origin](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0x013702a15624613befa0ed1488350610f8d98c3d71c82e240183e8692600a5f9)), cast the [first nounish cross-DAO vote](https://twitter.com/0xWiz_/status/1589946679872360448) ([federation.wtf](https://www.federation.wtf/daos/gnars)) and have led by example to help countless nounish builders.\n\n## ü§Ø Here's what 69 ETH looks like\n\nRather than bore you with the details, this timed open edition NFT is a highlight reel of what we've achieved since Proposal 51 passed.

Many thanks to [4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1600505145397317634) and [Jacob](https://jacob.energy/predicting-provenance.html) who inspired our making of this compilation and its subsequent minting. Shoutout [Kai](https://twitter.com/m3thaverse), [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye) and [Trizzy](https://twitter.com/trizzytrunk) for pulling everything together at short notice.\n\n## ü§î What'll 694.20 ETH look like?\n\nBrazil taught us that cultural relevance is incredibly important. For example, the giant noggles you've seen people skating are permanently installed in Rio de Janeiro at Pra√ßa XV, alongside other iconic urban sculptures installed each year by Coletivo XV.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uOAnnqd.png)\n\nOur giant noggles are in the same town square as the giant skateboard, one of the most photographed landmarks in Rio, third only to Christ the Redeemer and Sugar Loaf which are both globally recognisable.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/H5xaVey.png)](https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1598537522141069312)\n\nThe ability to do more activations like what we've seen in Brazil depends on the roll-out of the greatest onboarding effort Nouns has ever seen. Let's explore some of the ways we plan on scaling:\n\n### Builder onboarding via seasonal Prop House rounds\n\nGnars DAO has attracted builders who've paved the way with their creative approaches to activating their communities. Many hail from emerging markets where we can have an outsized impact and their values are already closely aligned with ours as crypto natives.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uYMx45z.png)\n\n[Prop House](https://prop.house) allows us to run mandated funding rounds each season that will see builders competing for the opportunity to uplift their respective communities. Each round will fund activations as described below and we've already received expressions of interest from suitable candidates throughout South America, Africa, Asia and more.\n\n### Public goods delivery through builder-led activations\n\nBuilders funded each round will be equipped with everything they need for public goods delivery through thoughtful and culturally relevant activations. Leaning on our experience in Brazil, we'll help motivated individuals become local heroes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/56iuFKh.gif)\n\nOur community will help them to implement nounish obstacles, crypto wallets and NFTs (10% of Gnars are for onboarding), merch and stickers, photo walls and banners, and to receive delivery of remuneration, Noun 189 skateboards and various types of noggles.\n\n### Hashtag campaigns to catalyse social media curation\n\nWe're not looking for \"[flash in the pan](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flash_in_the_pan)\" type events and are committed to the pursuit of the \"[nouns virtuous cycle](https://medium.com/@punk4156/the-nouns-virtuous-cycle-95586bb9c7c9).\" We will leverage hashtags like **#ThatsGnarly** across all platforms to launch ongoing crowd-sourced social media campaigns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/B82OcJz.jpg)\n\nSuch a rudimentary approach removes all barriers to entry so that the first step in joining the movement is simply posting to a hashtag. We can meet newcomers where they already express themselves, curate the best content based on impact and prepare creators for [a Web3 revolution](https://thatsgnar.ly).\n\n### Creator onboarding to the Gnars Revolution protocol\n\n[Revolution](https://github.com/collectivexyz/revolution) is a protocol from [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.xyz) (and [gnars.house](https://gnars.house/)) designed to enable the earning of governance rights through contributions other than capital. We are working closely with the team to give Gnars holders a reddit-like curatorial experience for content submitted to #ThatsGnarly.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wCsJkxJ.jpg)\n\nContent surfaces on a Web3 leaderboard at [thatsgnar.ly](https://thatsgnar.ly) after being submitted by extreme sports creators across social media. Competing in the \"gnarketplace\" for attention, top performing content is minted and sold as NBA Topshot style NFTs in daily auctions ‚Äì *ie. Prop House for tricks.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fxNEx13.jpg)\n\n*Trick NFTs released under CC0, Gnars NFTs drawn from 10% of supply already allocated to athlete/artist onboarding and each GNAR is equal to one Gnars DAO governance vote.*\n\n## üöÄ How we'll spend 694.20 ETH\n\nWe're a passionate community with domain expertise who know very well the agility required to succeed. Our plans are subject to change and funds will be disbursed through our own proven governance, but this should give you some idea of what to expect:\n\n### Activations\n\nSkateboard production and shipping, existing skate park refurbishments, localised merchandise production, Nouns Vision and Bigshot noggles, fabrication of more giant noggles and so much more.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XQ5qksI.jpg)\n\n*Additional locations where sculpture installation is not allowed will be activated using NFC enabled \"‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\" beacons that prompt visitors to get involved.* \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2OGWJ1z.jpg)\n\n*This is a rough mockup of small indestructible noggle fixtures that can be glued discreetly at existing spots without degrading an obstacle's user experience.*\n\n### Autonomy\n\nSince inception, our community have had access to Noun 189 in order to participate in Nouns DAO governance. The time has come for Gnars DAO to acquire two Nouns of their own. Enough funds to purchase 2 Nouns will be allocated to auction bidding.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vD0S5Ty.gif)\n\nAdditional funds from our ongoing NFT auctions will bolster this funding request, further efforts laid out in this proposal, and allow us to continue onboarding professional team riders who represent us throughout their respective industries as ambassadors.\n\n### Contributors\n\nAs required we will provide remuneration through governance to top notch contributors already attracted to Gnars including [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), [Alberto](https://twitter.com/alberto_campora), [Akva](https://twitter.com/Akva556), [Vlad](https://twitter.com/vladhzc), [Sam Mason de Caires](https://twitter.com/sammdec), [Brian](https://twitter.com/pbrianandj), [Rocketman](https://twitter.com/rocketman_w), [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi), [Davin](https://twitter.com/davinoyesigye), [Satori](https://twitter.com/0xSatori), [Lochie](https://twitter.com/lochieaxon) and [Knowhow92](https://twitter.com/theocharis_ch). We will approach these engagements on a competitive basis much like our activations. \n\nWe've been working hard to gain qualitative insight and to establish the most effective operational structure. As a community we have access to unrivalled industry expertise through our relationships with pro athletes, artists, media and brands. We look forward to inspiring many more of our connections through the very same thing that's gotten us to where we are ‚Äì word of mouth.\n\n> üìù **NOTE:** Funding receival to [gnars.eth](https://gnars.wtf/), a [gnosis safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x0658f4eD17289144717713ADfFC2539eF7c2EF8e/settings/owners) multisig [governed by Gnars DAO](https://gnars.house/) members as described in [Proposal 51](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51) with backup signers being [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi), [Oni](https://twitter.com/apenoun), [Noun 22](https://twitter.com/undeadnoun22) and [Blockbird](https://twitter.com/_blockbird).\n\n## üõπ We're built for onboarding\n\n[I recently asked nouns twitter](https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1596051642725830656), \"what is the biggest problem with nouns dao that needs solving?\" I was delighted to receive a response [from 4156 directly](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1596061577794330624): \n\n> \"same as every other crypto token imo: distribution. how to onboard maximum number of high quality, aligned etc. participants into the network\"\n\nOnboarding is something we take seriously at Gnars and we are uniquely positioned to onboard the next million [proliferatooooors](https://create.zora.co/collections/0x8c5effc5fb5d3805212713115427f4efe82a40be) by staying \"extremely nounish\" and applying the true grit and perseverance we've learned through our commitment to action sports culture.\n\n### Questions?\n\nJoin [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/gnars), subscribe to [gnarly.news](https://gnarly.news/), check out [gnars.com](https://gnars.com), or boardslide into our DMs on Twitter [(@gnars_dao)](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao) or Instagram [(@gnarsdao)](https://www.instagram.com/gnarsdao/). \n\nThanks everynoun for taking the time to peruse this funding request.\n\n[Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), like origami.\n\n‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®",

      "content": "# Creator Contests - a Nounish Funding Middleware\n\n## Tldr\nFund the Calabara team with 60 ETH to continue developing Creator Contests for a 3-month sprint.\n\n## Introduction\nHi NounsDAO, we‚Äôre nick and weez, the tandem behind Calabara and Creator Contests. \n\n### Our Nounish Journey: part 1\n\nBoth of us were introduced to Nouns by way of SharkDAO, which we first joined over a year ago. We were fascinated by the Nouns protocol and community and soon began building out sharkish tools to ease some of the unique challenges of a Nounish subDAO. We created a dashboard for SharkDAO, which included widgets for a snapshot client, calendar, and token-gated document center. We wanted to build a simple interface for casual members to be able to quickly catch up on the latest in SharkDAO and Nouns. Soon after, other communities asked if they could have their own dashboards. We open-sourced the code, modularized the components, and invited other web3 groups to join. Today, we‚Äôd describe [Calabara](https://calabara.com/explore) as an open-source design house for public infrastructure and applications.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V819CqQ.png)\n\n\nBy prop [62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62), we began to get excited about many of the ideas being communicated by the Prop House team. We'd been thinking deeply about community funding protocols for some time ourselves, and were eager to experiment with the Prop House model. Unfortunately, we weren‚Äôt yet able to run our own Prop House rounds at SharkDAO (because we don‚Äôt use an erc721 for governance). Prop House wasn‚Äôt open-source yet, so we decided to fork the core ideas of Prop House and build something of our own: Creator Contests. \n\n## Creator Contests ‚Ä¶ WTF?\n\nCreator Contests are a nounish middleware for distributing funds to creatives.\n\nCreating scalable funding infrastructure at all levels is a critical building block in establishing Nouns as the world's largest open-source brand. Creator contests build upon the strong foundations developed by the Prop House team while experimenting with novel features to create unique incentive systems and new ways to fund builders ‚Äì allowing any Nounish community with an ENS the ability to start running their own contests.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nSimilar to Prop House, participants create submissions in response to a contest prompt, and voters choose the best ones. Once the contest is over, funds are distributed to the winners. All contests follow this basic model, but administrators have full control over the contest settings to layer-on additional components. Here‚Äôs what we offer today ‚Ä¶\n\n* Submitter Rewards\n    * Define 1 or more winning ranks (1st, 2nd, ... nth place)\n    * Define 1 or more rewards for listed ranks (ETH, ERC20, ERC721)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LK2Vg12.png)\n\n* Voter Rewards\n    * Voters that accurately choose rank N submission will split X reward.\n    * Can be used to create unique incentive systems.\n    * NOMO-style games can be created, where voters join forces to try to choose the 2nd best submisison without pushing it to first place.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IBwqCwI.png)\n\n* Participant Restrictions\n    * Token thresholds required for participants to submit or vote\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/YcwFxhK.png)\n\n* Voting Strategies\n    * Token -- Voting power based on token holdings\n    * Arcade -- Uniform voting power for all qualifying voters\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/KpVyBT8.png)\n\n* Twitter Integration\n    * Collect submissions via Twitter interactions\n    * Inherit all existing infrastructure while proliferating via Twitter\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/0J7OkhJ.png)\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/cDWuZ26.gif)\n    \n* Additional Parameters\n    * Vote total visibility\n    * Anonymous Submissions\n    * Self Voting\n  ![](https://i.imgur.com/jkCGMtY.png)\n\n\n## Our Nounish Journey: part 2\n\nBefore Spring 2022, we had bootstrapped the project ourselves. We were lucky enough to receive support from SharkDAO, and they funded us with 7 ETH to develop an MVP of Creator Contests. We launched our first contest in September, and have helped fund 45 nounish creatives with ~4 ETH and 25k ERC-20 tokens since. 2 months ago, we received a small grant of 8 ETH from NSFW to develop the Twitter Integration mentioned above. We have groups like SharkDAO, Composables, TNS, and the Society of Nounish Cartoonists running contests as we speak. We are now ready to take Creator Contests to the next level.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Fk7grjB.png)\n\n\n## Goals for the funding period\n\nFor this funding period, we‚Äôd like to focus on ‚ÄúTop of the funnel‚Äù funding infrastructure. This means implementing a scalable protocol for funding creatives in the 0.069 - 3 ETH range. Our goal is to fund 100+ nounish creatives in the 3-month window.\n\nWhile bringing the codebase out of ‚ÄúMVP mode‚Äù so it can sufficiently scale to other Nounish pods (and make it easier to fork), we‚Äôll work on the following upgrades:\n\n* Support native video and other media formats\n* Add vote audit reports\n* Add voting capability for Noun delegates\n* Experiment with new voting strategies\n* Simplify contest initialization process.\n* Improve our twitter algorithms\n* UX redesign - It‚Äôs time for CC to get Nounish\n\n\nWe‚Äôd also like to answer the following questions:\n\n* Are voter rewards a feature or a bug?\n* In the voting period, how impactful are visible vote totals on a communities ability to choose the ‚Äúbest‚Äù submissions?\n* Does submission history serve as a relevant talent repository for other pods?\n* Are deep Twitter integrations viable for other tasks, like governance? (Nouncil, Nerman, etc)\n* Are there ways to maintain a certain level of submission quality without directly moderating submissions?\n    * Prop House already sees a certain percentage of ‚Äúlow quality‚Äù submissions, and we‚Äôll see higher levels at this funding tier. Are there ways to ensure a certain quality standard without direct moderation? Learnings from this experimentation could be layered on top of Prop House and other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Defining success\n\nSuccess at the funding tier we are targeting is tightly coupled with onboarding. We‚Äôll define onboarding for the scope of this project as the following:\n\n* New creatives\n    * Introduce new creatives to Nouns and extension communities\n* Existing creatives to larger funding tiers\n    * Support creatives in the earliest stages of ideation that can translate to quality Prop House or NSFW proposals\n* Between Nounish extension communities\n    * Increase the discoverability factor of extension projects and communities through different contest designs and synergies, i.e.\n        * TNS and Composables co-host a round\n        * Multi-community voting\n        * Twitter contests\n\nOf course, success for us also hinders on our ability to proliferate the meme. Twitter integrations drastically increase our proliferation potential -- elevating contests from a siloed web app to a publicly discoverable and interactable experience. We're focused on lifting the stack as close to the \"public edge\" as possible and see the potential for these integrations in other Nounish areas.  \n\nDefining success is one thing, measuring it is different. For this funding term, we‚Äôll do so manually by following up with participants and winners while exploring ways we can automate and better measure this in the future.\n\n\n## Prop House\n\n*Why not just fork Prop House for real?*\n\nWhile we haven‚Äôt really heard this much, it‚Äôs a valid question that we anticipate some Nouners might have.\n\nHalting further experimentation to go back and layer our changes on top of the PH codebase feels like a step backwards at this point in time. We envision a coordinated approach where both PH and CC are able to sandbox and test different ideas and merge the ones that work. Ultimately, the far more relevant component to fork will be the smart contracts for a trustless implementation that the PH team is leading, which we fully plan on doing. \n\nAt worst, CC is an alternative client for Prop House. At best, it is an experiment in funding infrastructure, working alongside Prop House in developing sound protocols for high velocity, trustless, and scalable funding infrastructure for web3 communities ‚Äì all powered by Nouns.\n\n## Team\n\nWeez: frontend, designer, UX, support\nNick: lead dev, fullstack\n\n## Links\n* [Calabara](https://calabara.com/explore)\n* [Github](https://github.com/calabara-hq/calabara)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/calabarahq)\n\n## Budget\n\n60 ETH for continued development\n\n3/5 Multisig tasked with sending 30 ETH of project funds to the team wallet upon execution, and setting up a 3-month stream for the remaining funds.\n\nSigners:\n\nNick: nickdodson.eth\nBenbodhi: signed.benbodhi.eth\nJuan: juanx.eth\nJoshuaFisher: joshuafisher.eth\nToadyHawk: toadyhawk.eth\n\n\n## Proposed Transactions\n\n0x55d1f4091Ced357cD4C4F9dd12531b8fDBe2dd26.transfer(\n    60.0 ETH\n)",

We want to make governance participation fun. \n\nOur vision is to create a governance platform that is both delightful and easy to use, empowering voters to effectively govern NounsDAO. The client is being created on top of an upcoming open-source framework, built by nounish developers, for nounish developers.\n\n# Current progress\n\nWe've had early success with [House of Nouns](https://houseofnouns.wtf/), with many Nouners and non-Nouners alike expressing their love of the intuitive interface. We want to continue building on this success and make it easier for people to participate in governance in an engaging way.\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 9.40.34 PM.png](https://imgur.com/D7F1Q0a.png)\n\nNot familiar with House of Nouns? You can discuss proposals with others, view important context, and vote all in one intuitive interface on [https://houseofnouns.wtf](https://houseofnouns.wtf). \n\n**Some data:** \n\n- MAUs - growing 100% month / month\n    \n    ![Screen Shot 2022-12-08 at 7.03.38 PM.png](https://imgur.com/aKCSwBO.png)\n    \n- Working with Nouns, Lil Nouns, and Gnars. In talks with many more communities.\n    \n    [https://houseoflilnouns.wtf](https://houseoflilnouns.wtf/proposals/69)\n    \n    [https://gnars.house](https://gnars.house) \n    \n- ~13.5% registered-user market penetration\n    - 170 registered users / 1263 total members in Nouns (delegates + Nouners + anyone who has voted or made a proposal on-chain or in Prop House)\n\n# **Core vision and goals**\n\nOur vision is to make it easier for voters to participate in Nouns governance by providing rich context, intuitive conversation tools, and seamless integrations with other Nounish platforms. This will be built on top of an open framework, empowering developers and solving impactful problems specific to nounish governance. \n\nIn short:\n\n- Provide all context on proposals, voters, builders, and team members, and view all conversations from Discord, Twitter, and Discourse in one place\n- Build a custom forum client directly into HoN that is backwards compatible w/Discourse, allowing users to create and discuss proposal drafts and get early feedback\n- Provide first-class support for Nouns forks and Prop House, and deeper integrations with Atlas, Federation and Agora\n- Create the open source House of Nouns framework, serving core data displayed on the site through a GraphQL API, paired with a developer friendly SDK for building on top of House of Nouns infrastructure\n\n## Product Breakdown\n\n### **Context layer**\n\nWe will attach more information to proposals, such as FAQs, comments, relevant links, conversations from other platforms, video attachments, and more. We're currently working with @maty.eth on integrating data from [proposals.wtf](http://proposals.wtf). \n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 1.20.48 PM.png](https://imgur.com/NWxsu7o.png)\n\nWe also will provide more context on Nouners, builders, and team members, such as their past proposals, voting record, and Agora profile, directly in HoN. \n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-07 at 9.35.06 PM.png](https://imgur.com/b8zipr3.png)\n\nAfter a proposal is executed, we will make it easy to see what has been delivered as a result.\n\n### Forums + conversation stack\n\nWe're building an alternative forum client like Discourse that pulls data from Discourse, and integrates token signaling and Ethereum-based identities. This will be built into House of Nouns and will allow users to create and discuss proposal drafts, get early feedback, and graduate drafts to proposals. It will also provide context on builders and [members](https://collective.xyz/nouns/members), and allow token-based voting.\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-12-09 at 1.19.55 PM.png](https://imgur.com/oXSPL8Y.png)\n\nWe also want to provide more intuitive ways to get early community consensus, such as upvote/idea boards. This will allow users to easily move from an idea to a draft proposal, get comments, and then move to an on-chain proposal with ongoing comments and voting.\n\n### Integrations\n\nDeeper integrations with other Nounish products like Nouns Atlas and Nouns Agora. \n\nView conversation from Discord, Twitter, Discourse etc. in-line on [houseofnouns.wtf](http://houseofnouns.wtf). \n\nFirst class support for Nouns forks, Prop House, Federation, and other governance sources\n\n- one-click governance clients for Nouns forks\n- vote on Prop House rounds directly in HoN with intuitive and easy UI\n- Federation integration (ex: vote on HoN as a Gnars holder)\n\nWhile we will make sure our infrastructure can support all Nounish communities, we will focus on solving problems specific to Nouns governance in the next 6 months. We believe this is where we can have the biggest impact.\n\n## House of Nouns Framework\n\nWe are building an open source framework to give builders the tools they need to build custom governance and discussion experiences for their communities. We will build House of Nouns on top of this framework, in a similar vein to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) being both a builder and end-user of NextJS. \n\nThe main components of the framework are:\n\nOpen access to core data displayed on the site through a GraphQL API.\n\nReact [SDK](https://github.com/collectivexyz/sdk) for developing on top of House of Nouns infrastructure, including hooks to access data, pre-built components etc. \n\n## Differentiation\n\nAgora approaches the problem of low governance participation from the delegation perspective. Don‚Äôt want to vote? Delegate to someone to do it for you. \n\nHouse of Nouns approaches it from the conversation and context-aggregation perspective.  Empowering Nouners to vote independently and be empowered to think for themselves. \n\nBoth approaches are valid and necessary for the ecosystem to grow. We will be working closely with Agora to ensure we don‚Äôt build the same things and otherwise waste valuable energy. \n\n## Success Metrics\n\nOur goal is to have 30% or more of the Nounish ecosystem using (voting/discussing/viewing) House of Nouns *every week*. Currently, about 14% are registered users. We believe that with further improvements to the proposal conversation stack and better user experience, we can reach this goal. \n\nUltimately, our goal is to have the House of Nouns framework and SDK integrated into 10 or more clients by July 2023.\n\nWe will use these as the two primary metrics to evaluate our success in 6 months.\n\n# **Transparency & decentralization**\n\nAs a governance platform, we want to avoid centralization of power by taking the following measures:\n\n- Building the House of Nouns framework as an open source public good\n    - Offer up all data through APIs and a developer friendly SDK\n    - Transition discussion data to open data layers as soon as an attractive option has wide adoption / traction\n    - Offer a React SDK for components and data fetching\n- Current House of Nouns team members added together will commit to not represent more than 5% of NounsDAO.\n\nOur goal is to open-source the core building blocks of governance and discussion, and provide killer developer tooling on top of the HoN rails so anyone can build custom experiences for their communities and subcultures. \n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe plan to generate revenue by offering bespoke upgrades to other DAOs similar to Red Hat, as well as charging hosting costs for larger communities. Our goal is for the HoN client to become self-sustainable within 12-16 months. These upgrades will be built into the broader platform and framework for all users. \n\nFor the HoN framework, we‚Äôre exploring alternative public goods funding routes (Nouns model, Gitcoin etc.) so we can be empowered to continue building something maximally useful for the entire ecosystem. \n\n# ********Team********\n\nWe are a small startup [(collective.xyz)](https://twitter.com/collectivexyz) that has been building for Nouns and won the governance client mandate [round](https://prop.house/nouns/nouns-governance-clients) 3 months ago. \n\nHouse of Nouns team:\n\n[dadkins](https://twitter.com/dadkins_) - 9 years in software, longtime crypto hacker, cofounder [@collective.xyz](https://twitter.com/collective.xyz)\n\nwhise - lead data engineer ex: Amazon / longtime buildor\n\n[Wojciech](https://kocjan.net/) - Killer product engineer, built [nounslaunchpad.wtf](https://nounslaunchpad.wtf)\n\n[Tim G](https://github.com/timmyg) - former head of engineering at crypto startup, full stack maestro\n\nwith support from [rocketman](https://twitter.com/rocketman_w) and [jac](https://github.com/jac18281828)\n\n# Funding Request\n\nWe compare closely to other proposals, like [Agora‚Äôs 3-month proposal](https://houseofnouns.xyz/proposals/154) (170 ETH for a team of 4 for 3 months (14 ETH per mo./ person), or Nouns AI Pod (12.75 ETH per mo./ person). \n\nWe request 340 ETH in USDC to fund development of House of Nouns framework & client over the next 6 months (Jan ‚Äò23 - Jun ‚Äò23).\n\n‚Ä¢ 330 ETH: 4+ engineers (13.75 ETH per mo./ person)\n\n‚Ä¢ 10 ETH: funding for Prop House round(s) to build out alternative clients and views into governance+discussion on top of the HoN framework.  \n\n50% deposited immediately to the teams wallet via [USDC payments contract](https://nouns.wtf/vote/172).\n\n50% USDC streamed over a period of 6 months from a 3/5 multisig held by trusted members of the community.

Approximately 560 of those have been sold to individuals.*\n\nAs per the on-chain proposal, 500 tokens of Nouns Vision NFT's (each redeemable for an individual pair of physical glasses) were transferred to the Nouns DAO treasury. \n\n## Proposal: \n\nThe authors of this proposal are asking the DAO, on behalf of the communities they represent (Nouns Esports, Gnars, The Noun Square), for an allocation of these sunglasses to be used to further proliferate Nouns DAO as well as help market and drive new buyers towards Nouns Vision.\n\nBy distributing these tokens across various sub-communities, we can further proliferate Nouns through physical interactions with the highest quality noggles available.\n\nThe undersigned sub-communities of Nouns DAO are asking for fifty Nouns Vision tokens each (150 total) from the Nouns treasury in order to continue their efforts of proliferation.\n\n- [The Noun Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare)\n    - Proposed use: Media appearances from hosts, and distribution via giveaways on Twitter and YouTube, including as prizes for a planned Nouns DAO Awards Show in December.\n- [Nouns Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports)\n    - Proposed use: Primarily the pairs will be kept on retainer and esports operators will coordinate with players to have them used in prominent competitive-gaming events or live-streaming opportunities. Additionally, a portion will be distributed as gaming competition prizes.\n- [Gnars](https://twitter.com/gnars_dao)\n    - Proposed use: Extreme athletes could wear these in social media posts, at IRL events, and in interviews. All of which have high potential for visibility, especially outside of the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nConversation towards this effort has already been taking place in the #57-sunglasses channel of the Nouns Discord server. For further context, see the initial post towards this idea [from Gami](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/940715393901789336/1012904461380882503) and continued discussion [from Worthalter](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/940715393901789336/1025188064877879316) who suggested distributing pairs from the treasury.\n\n\nAdditionally, our sub-communities would be interested in exploring Zora's functionality of a \"[Finders Fee](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/5961853-how-to-set-a-finder-s-fee#:~:text=Sellers%20can%20set%20the%20Finder%27s,paid%20to%20the%20referrer%27s%20address)\" to further incentivize the promotion of Nouns Vision, with the goal to aid in selling out the entire collection.\n\n*(`*`) Even though the total number of mints is around 1800, this includes 500 for Nouns DAO, 500 presumably reserved for the special edition disco noggles, and 250 for the team.*",

I had delegated my nouns to the houseofnouns team without knowing that until a prop reaches execution (even after voting passes) removing voting power from the proposer's address can mean that anyone can cancel the prop. Unfortunately it was cancelled as a result. My sincere apologies for the need to revote.**\n\n------\n\n[@ZachXBT](https://twitter.com/zachxbt) is a public good serving the crypto ecosystem through tireless research exposing [countless scams](https://investigations.notion.site/). Recent events have highlighted the dire need and importance of such work. This prop proposes to fund 100 ETH to their donation address: zachxbt.eth (address can be verified from their twitter profile).\n\nDonations have always been somewhat controversial within Nouns governance. [Prop 21](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) donating 169 ETH to Gitcoin grants was one of the most contentious votes in our early history. [Prop 108](https://nouns.wtf/vote/108) donating 500 ETH to Ethereum protocol development (via the Protocol Guild) was much more unanimous but still there was discomfort and discourse around whether the DAO was becoming \"a tax inefficient way for DAO members to make donations.\"\n\nI agree that we shouldn't resort to becoming a complacent vehicle of passive philanthropy. We should instead aim to actively contribute and be a net producer of public goods ourselves such that our meme (brand) can fully capture the provenance value (claim on originality of) the public work and thus leverage the virtuous cycle to do more than what capital alone could have done. However, there should be exceptions to this rule if there is an urgent and common public cause that warrants highlighting. I would like to suggest that this is such a case. Crypto needs more validators like ZachXBT.\n\nWith donations we need to be extra wary of conflicts of interest or self-dealing. Unfortunately there is no way to prove this cryptographically, but I attest that I have no prior (or planned future) relationship with ZachXBT and that today was the first time I contacted them (via twitter) to ask for their permission to make this proposal.",

      "title": "SNP - Creator Contests",
      "content": "Should SharkDAO put the following proposal on-chain at NounsDAO and vote yes?\n\n## Tldr\nFund the Calabara team to continue developing Creator Contests for a 3 month trial.\n\n## Introduction\nHi NounsDAO, we‚Äôre nick and weez, the tandem behind Calabara and Creator Contests. \n\n### Our Nounish Journey: part 1\n\nBoth of us were introduced to Nouns by way of SharkDAO, which we first joined over a year ago. We were fascinated by the Nouns protocol and community, and soon began building out sharkish tools to ease some of the unique challenges of a Nounish subDAO. We created a dashboard for SharkDAO, which included widgets for a snapshot client, calendar, and token gated document center. We wanted to build a simple interface for casual members to be able to quickly catch up on the latest in SharkDAO and Nouns. Soon after, other communities asked if they could have their own dashboards. We open-sourced the code, modularized the components, and invited other web3 groups to join. Today, we‚Äôd describe Calabara as an open-source design house for public infrastructure and applications.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/V819CqQ.png)\n\n\nBy prop [62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62), we began to get excited about many of the ideas being communicated by the Prop House team. We'd been thinking deeply about community funding protocols for some time ourselves, and were eager to experiment with the Prop House model. Unfortunately, we weren‚Äôt yet able to run our own Prop House rounds at SharkDAO (because we don‚Äôt use an erc721 for governance). Prop House wasn‚Äôt open-source yet, so we decided to fork the core ideas of Prop House and build something of our own: Creator Contests. \n\n## Creator Contests ‚Ä¶ WTF?\n\nCreator Contests are a nounish middleware for distributing funds to creatives.\n\nCreating scalable funding infrastructure at all levels is a critical building block in establishing Nouns as the worlds largest open source brand. Creator contests build upon the strong foundations developed by the Prop House team, while experimenting with novel features to create unique incentive systems and new ways to fund builders ‚Äì allowing any Nounish community with an ENS the ability to start running their own contests.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nSimilar to Prop House, participants create submissions in response to a contest prompt, and voters choose the best ones. Once the contest is over, funds are distributed to the winners. All contests follow this basic model, but administrators have full control over the contest settings to layer-on additional components. Here‚Äôs what we offer today ‚Ä¶\n\n* Submitter Rewards\n    * Define 1 or more winning ranks (1st, 2nd, ... nth place)\n    * Define 1 or more rewards for listed ranks (ETH, ERC20, ERC721)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LK2Vg12.png)\n\n* Voter Rewards\n    * Voters that accurately choose rank N submission will split X reward.\n    * Can be used to create unique incentive systems.\n    * NOMO-style games can be created, where voters join forces to try to choose the 2nd best submisison without pushing it to first place.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IBwqCwI.png)\n\n* Participant Restrictions\n    * Token thresholds required for participants to submit or vote\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/YcwFxhK.png)\n\n* Voting Strategies\n    * Token -- Voting power based on token holdings\n    * Arcade -- Uniform voting power for all qualifying voters\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/KpVyBT8.png)\n\n* Twitter Integration\n    * Collect submissions via twitter interactions\n    * Inherit all existing infrastructure while proliferating via twitter\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/0J7OkhJ.png)\n    * in action\n    ![](https://i.imgur.com/cDWuZ26.gif)\n    \n* Additional Parameters\n    * Vote total visibility\n    * Anonymous Submissions\n    * Self Voting\n  ![](https://i.imgur.com/jkCGMtY.png)\n\n\n## Our Nounish Journey: part 2\n\nBefore Spring 2022, we had bootstrapped the project ourselves. We were lucky enough to receive support from SharkDAO, and they funded us with 7 ETH to develop an MVP of Creator Contests. We launched our first contest in September, and have helped fund creatives with ~4 ETH and 25k ERC-20 tokens since. 2 months ago, we received a small grant of 8 ETH from NSFW to develop the Twitter Integration mentioned above. We have groups like SharkDAO, Composables, TNS, and the Society of Nounish Cartoonists running contests as we speak. We are now ready to take Creator Contests to the next level.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Fk7grjB.png)\n\n\n## Goals for the funding period\n\nFor this funding period, we‚Äôd like to focus on ‚ÄúTop of the funnel‚Äù funding infrastructure. This means implementing a scalable protocol for funding creatives in the 0.069 - 3 ETH range. \n\nWhile bringing the codebase out of ‚ÄúMVP mode‚Äù so it can sufficiently scale to other Nounish pods (and make it easier to fork), we‚Äôll work on the following upgrades:\n\n* Support native video and other media formats\n* Add vote audit reports\n* Add voting capability for Noun delegates\n* Experiment with new voting strategies\n* Simplify contest initialization process.\n* Improve our twitter algorithms\n* UX redesign - It‚Äôs time for CC to get Nounish\n\n\nWe‚Äôd also like to answer the following questions:\n\n* Are voter rewards a feature or a bug?\n* In the voting period, how impactful are visible vote totals on a communities ability to choose the ‚Äúbest‚Äù submissions?\n* Does submission history serve as a relevant talent repository for other pods?\n* Are deep Twitter integrations viable for other tasks, like governance? (Nouncil, Nerman, etc)\n* Are there ways to maintain a certain level of submission quality without directly moderating submissions?\n    * Prop House already sees a certain percentage of ‚Äúlow quality‚Äù submissions, and we‚Äôll see higher levels at this funding tier. Are there ways to ensure a certain quality standard without direct moderation? Learnings from this experimentation could be layered on top of Prop House and other applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Defining success\n\nSuccess at the funding tier we are targeting is tightly coupled with onboarding. We‚Äôll define onboarding for the scope of this project as the following:\n\n* New creatives\n    * Introduce new creatives to Nouns and extension communities\n* Existing creatives to larger funding tiers\n    * Support creatives in the earliest stages of ideation that can translate to quality Prop House or NSFW proposals\n* Between Nounish extension communities\n    * Increase the discoverability factor of extension projects and communities through different contest designs and synergies, i.e.\n        * TNS and Composables co-host a round\n        * Multi-community voting\n        * Twitter contests\n\nOf course, success for us also hinders on our ability to proliferate the meme. Twitter integrations drastically increase our proliferation potential -- elevating contests from a siloed webapp to a publicly discoverable and interactable experience. We're focused on lifting the stack as close to the \"public edge\" as possible, and see potential for these integrations in other Nounish areas.  \n\nDefining success is one thing, measuring it is different. For this funding term, we‚Äôll do so manually by following up with participants and winners while exploring ways we can automate and better measure this in the future.\n\n\n## Prop House\n\n*Why not just fork Prop House for real?*\n\nWhile we haven‚Äôt really heard this much, it‚Äôs a valid question that we anticipate some Nouners might have.\n\nHalting further experimentation to go back and layer our changes on top of the PH codebase feels like a step backwards at this point in time. We envision a coordinated approach where both PH and CC are able to sandbox and test different ideas and merge the ones that work. Ultimately, the far more relevant component to fork will be the smart contracts for a trustless implementation that the PH team is leading, which we fully plan on doing. \n\nAt worst, CC is an alternative client for Prop House. At best, it is an experiment in funding infrastructure, working alongside Prop House in developing sound protocols for high velocity, trustless, and scalable funding infrastructure for web3 communities ‚Äì all powered by Nouns.\n\n\n## Budget\n\n60 ETH for continued development\n\n3/5 Multisig tasked with sending 30 ETH of project funds to the team wallet upon execution, and setting up a 3 month stream for the remaining funds.\n\nSigners:\n\nNick: nickdodson.eth\nBenbodhi: signed.benbodhi.eth\nJuan: juanx.eth\nJoshuaFisher: joshuafisher.eth\nToadyHawk: toadyhawk.eth\n\n\n## Proposed Transactions\n\n0x55d1f4091Ced357cD4C4F9dd12531b8fDBe2dd26.transfer(\n    60.0 ETH\n)",

      "content": "# Prop House Mainnet\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/zcJlAJu.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJsYV5eDEX8)\n\n*(üëÜ click on video for a Nouns Prop House teaser)*\n\n---\n\n***tl;dr:**\nWe‚Äôve reached the one year mark since the inception of the idea for Prop House! Over that time period, Prop House has become a core piece of infrastructure for the development of the Nouns ecosystem ‚Äì onboarding a sizable percentage of the most impactful builders while spreading the Nouns meme far and wide. We are requesting 570 ETH to continue to fund development of Prop House over the next 6 months (Jan ‚Äò23 - Jun ‚Äò23).*\n\n---\n\n***State of the Prop House(s):**\nOn Dec 1st, 2022, Seneca hosted an open call to update the community on what we‚Äôve been up to since the [proposal #105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105). You can view the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TbJsbXWCPxbMyE25Xr_kfQjJJYMtGw0HEYuLrtdkndI/edit?usp=sharing) and recording of the talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qD9v1ihIRmw).*\n\n---\n\n## Onboarding builders\nThe most important outcome of Prop House for Nouns has been its ability to onboard a large percentage of the most impactful builders in the ecosystem. **More than funding, the core feature of Prop House is about activating builders**. Whether it be for folks who had never heard of Nouns before or those who were just hanging around, Prop House was the mechanism that took them from inactive to building within the ecosystem.\n\nGiven Nouns is about bottom-up brand building as opposed to top-down centralized direction, we hope that Prop House can continue to serve as a tool to execute on that Nouns vision. Below is a list of some of the builders who‚Äôve been activated by Prop House:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2ZeeWk9.png)\n\n## Where we are today by the numbers\nOur last proposal ([#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)) passed on July 18, 2022. Since then, we‚Äôve made substantial progress on all core Prop House KPIs:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JtrkRUm.png)\n\nAll our charts are seeing sustained month-over-month growth despite market downturns:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fBw6qTd.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/P5rXSsH.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4q3e9hS.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jr1bwSR.jpg)\n\nThe funnel from prop award to prop completion has maintained a high conversion rate. Close to 85% of all prop winners go on to complete their proposed work. Below is an analysis on all prop winners from all funding rounds within the [Nouns house](https://prop.house/nouns) (18 funding rounds and 105 awarded proposals):\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/H71CV2j.jpg)\n\n## Spreading the Nouns meme\nOver the past 5 months we‚Äôve onboarded several communities, most notably [Meebits](https://prop.house/meebits) via [Ape Coin DAO funding](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-110-meebits-prophouse-sponsored-by-apecoin/8219). By doing so, Prop House has spread the Nouns meme far beyond our immediate community. In tandem with Prop House growth comes furthering the reach of the Nouns meme along with what Nouns stands for: building.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nTQsPIo.jpg)\n\n## Product\nThe Prop House team has been busy working on the core product ([prop.house](https://prop.house)). A brief summary of what we‚Äôve done follows:\n\n- Contracted one the best designers in the space (0xHab from Rainbow)\n- Revamped UI across the entire app\n- Implemented multi-round houses\n- Upgraded voting UX\n- Open sourced the [repository](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/).\n- Released a [GraphQL interface](https://prod.backend.prop.house/graphql) for Prop House data which lead to projects like [NounsAtlas](https://nounsatlas.com), [Voters.wtf](https://voters.wtf) and [Nounish.cv](https://nounish.netlify.app/)\n\n## Protocol\nWe‚Äôve also made strides in the development of the Prop House protocol.\n\nThe protocol leverages both Ethereum and Starknet in an effort to provide the best possible user experience. This dual-chain architecture enables Prop House users to propose and vote by signing a message, while decentralizing the entire funding flow.\n\nWe use Ethereum as the operations and execution layer, where houses are managed and payouts are made, while Starknet handles all user actions that occur within a funding round.\n\nAll of the code is publicly available today in the [Prop House repository](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol).\n\nBelow are some of the core pieces of infrastructure we‚Äôve developed to support the protocol, where we are currently, and what to expect as we near mainnet launch:\n\n- The [protocol](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol/packages/prop-house-contracts) itself, which has been deployed to Goerli.\n- The [Prop House SDK](https://github.com/Prop-House/prop-house-monorepo/tree/protocol/packages/prop-house-sdk), which simplifies interaction with the protocol (L1 & L2).\n- The Starknet Relayer, which is responsible for submitting signed proposals and votes to Starknet on behalf of users.\n- Ethereum & Starknet subgraphs, which are currently in development.\n- Current blockers:\n    - [Cairo V1 Migration](https://medium.com/starkware/open-sourcing-cairo-1-0-b3100a664bb0)\n    - [Support for V1 on StarkNet](https://medium.com/starkware/starknet-regenesis-the-plan-bd0219843ef4) (expected Q1 ‚Äò23)\n    - Protocol audits (pending testing on testnet)\n\nAssuming no major hiccups, we aim to deploy the protocol to mainnet before the end of Q1 2023.\n\n## Financials\n*The Prop House financials doc is publicly available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iKGgedZmAzMNCFkd2PqjBd-ZgutrOjuYqfirDG1wS3g/edit?usp=sharing)*\n\nOver the course of one year and three proposals ([#23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23), [#62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62), [#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105)), Nouns DAO has funded the Prop House team 555 ETH for deploying towards Nouns builders and 695 ETH for development and operating expenses.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oxC4c8l.png)\n\n*Note: current burn rate for Nouns funding rounds is low (~20-30 ETH / mo). If at any point the DAO chooses to have another party deploy Nouns House Funding, we will return all remaining funds to the DAO.*\n\n## What‚Äôs next?\n### Protocol launch\nWe are aiming for a mainnet launch by the end of Q1 2023. What follows is the timeline we are executing against to get to launch:\n\n- Migrate to Cairo V1\n- Complete Goerli testing\n- Finalize Prop House SDK & Starknet Relayer\n- Launch subgraphs for Ethereum & Starknet\n- Developer documentation\n- Protocol audit\n\n### Product development\nAlongside the transition to the protocol as the data layer, we will continue to develop the UX of app:\n- Core UX: better proposing, discovery and voting user experiences.\n- The launch of house and round managers such that anyone can create a house, deposit funds and initiate funding rounds.\n- Implementation for infinite rounds for grant pods to run their entire operation via Prop House.\n- Develop social features for communities. \n\n## Sustainability\nThere are several avenues to explore on how to make Prop House sustainable. For the time being, we are continuing to pursue funding by Nouns DAO as we believe it to be a positive sum engagement. Below we dive into potential avenues:\n\n### Nouns DAO funded (current)\nTo date, Nouns DAO has funded development costs of Prop House over the past ~12 months (695 ETH). For the current model to continue to work, Nouners would have to agree that the value created for Nouns by Prop House is higher than that of the development costs. In this framing, Nouns DAO is a patron to Prop house where its ROI is the onboarding of high impact builders, the attention generated by Prop House as public infrastructure by Nouns DAO and it being infrastructure for Nouns to run on.\n\n### Fees for usage\nThe true and tried approach is turning on fees at the client and/or protocol. This approach would require a substantial increase in volume (to the order of about 50-100x) to maintain current burn rates. So while feasible, it is not a solution for the short term. \n\n### Experimental\n**Nounish DAO**\nIn prop [#105](https://nouns.wtf/vote/105), we posed Prop House DAO as a plausible avenue to making Prop House sustainable. While it is still a potential route, there are concerns as to whether or not the DAO makes sense at all. At the core of it is whether the Nouns DAO format is appropriate for non-purely meme driven protocols. There‚Äôs also the question of whether every protocol needs a DAO and a corresponding governance token. So while the DAO is not out of the question, we believe that with experiments like [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build/), the answer will become clearer over time. \n**Pure Meme NFTs**\nThere‚Äôs a case to be made where Prop House NFTs are minted to hold provenance value. This alone could capture long-term upside in the same way a visual artist and their collectors do. \n\n## Funding Request\n570 ETH to fund development of Prop House protocol & client over the next 6 months (Jan ‚Äò23 - Jun ‚Äò23). \n- 486 ETH: 3 engineers, 1 designer and 1 all hats.\n- 84 ETH for OpEx including contractors, infra, audits, bounties, translators, etc.\n\nFunds would be received by the [Prop House team multi-sig (3/5)](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x5BcD6f3B0a5519D448FBDf33204091bbE097C992/) where the signers are Seneca, Solimander, CDT, VapeApe and Devcarrot.",

See my Tenor page https://tenor.com/users/coralorca\n* Side proliferation on large social networks with common keywords. Get traffic by appearing on top of the \"Retainer\" and \"Fire Hydrant\" search engine for billions of users.\n\n## **SCOPE: TIKTOK + INSTAGRAM + SNAP**\n\nI initially received funding from NSFW to create the AR glasses on Snapchat, then won two Prophouse rounds ([round 5](https://prop.house/nouns/round-5/498) and [round 7](https://prop.house/nouns/round-7/860)) which funded 8 additional filters bringing the total on Snapchat to 13.\n\nThe frog head has been ported to TikTok and Instagram as a feasibility test.\n\n\nFor this proposal I will create: \n\n\n**- 50 Noun heads on TikTok with the ability to switch between the 23 glasses colors using a simple screen tap.**\nCreating these requires [Effect House](https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/), TikTok‚Äôs AR filter authoring tool.\n>üê∏ [Try the TikTok frog head](https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMF92trdt/) \n\n![](https://imgur.com/2GCssla.jpeg)\n\n###### The TikTok Frog effect has been played over 5000 times since its publication on 11/24/22 (without any marketing)\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**- 50 Noun heads on Instagram with the ability to switch between the 23 glasses colors using a simple screen tap.**\nCreating these requires [SparkAR](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio), Meta‚Äôs AR filter authoring tool.\n\n>üê∏ [Try the Instagram frog head](https://www.instagram.com/ar/667609521529085)\n>Also available on [FB](https://www.facebook.com/fbcameraeffects/tryit/667609521529085/) and [Messenger video calling](https://www.messenger.com/ar/667609521529085)\n\n![](https://imgur.com/vVXc6G7.jpeg)\n\n###### Instagram video preview\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n**- 37 additional Noun heads on Snapchat (bringing the total published on Snapchat to 50) with the ability to switch between 23 glasses colors using a simple screen tap.** \nCreating these requires [Studio Lens](https://ar.snap.com/lens-studio), Snap's AR filter authoring tool.\n\nSnap Lenses are particularly interesting because they:\n- Integrate seamlessly with Discord, Zoom, Twitch, Google Hangout, OBS etc. using the free [Snap Camera](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/) desktop application. See this [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWIZn\\_-oFig) I made if you want to learn how to do it.\n- Have advanced face tracking features with seamless animations\n\n> üê∏ Try the Snap Frog head [here](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=8cbf1be819ec4a888f6917453a1d17c8&metadata=01)\nü¶à Try the Snap Shark head [here](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=a1839d8ba0074f49882af6378ab63577&metadata=01)\nü§ñ Try the Snap Robot head [here](https://www.snapchat.com/unlock/?type=SNAPCODE&uuid=102be3194e2d49fb83d297e4b9d18103&metadata=01)\n(You can use your phone and the Snapchat app or your desktop with [Snap camera](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/))\n\n![](https://imgur.com/M5Ybldo.jpeg)\n\n###### Over 13 heads created on the Snapchat platform, see [creator page](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/creator/6y\\_fgP0Vr6RqaJt3jIJLRw).\n\n---\n\n## **PROCESS**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/dsON2XB.jpeg)\n\n###### Consistency across the different authoring software: Snap‚Äôs *Lens Studio*, Meta‚Äôs *SparkAR*, and TikTok‚Äôs *Effect House*.\n\nI have been optimizing this pipeline for some time, and each trait needs custom animations depending on its shape. The geometry has to be considered individually, and some traits are more challenging than others. This is a similar process to what I went through when translating all 2D Nouns to 3D voxels with 3Dnouns.com. You can speed up the pipeline with work habits and experience, but each head requires specific attention to craft the Nounish details that make the difference.\n\n## **METRICS**\nI will share metrics from the different social platforms with the community.\nHere are some metrics from the Snapchat filters created with Prophouse funding and some recently published filters on TikTok.\n\n#### TIKTOK\n![](https://imgur.com/Qdb7oSX.jpeg)\n###### Close to 20k plays in two weeks with 0 marketing.\n\n#### SNAPCHAT\n\n![](https://imgur.com/PFoW7Ri.jpeg)\n\n###### The Robot Noun‚Äôs head has almost 600k plays in November! This is an interesting case of side effect proliferation. \n\n![](https://imgur.com/T1NMuqt.jpeg)\n\n###### BudLight was the first filter created, and currently totals over 4k plays.\n\n\n\n\n\n## **PORTING MODELS TO INSTAGRAM AND TIKTOK**\nI will import the 50 models to Meta‚Äôs and TikTok‚Äôs AR authoring software (respectively *SparkAR* and *Effect House*) to publish them to Instagram, Messenger, Facebook, and TikTok and reach a wider audience. \nRegarding the workflow, the 3D assets will be re-used, however, they still need to be imported, positioned, scaled, lit and the animation triggers need to be configured on an individual basis and depending on each software capabilities. \nFrom a technical standpoint Snap Lens Studio > SparkAR > TikTok Effect house. My goal is to make each Noun head as consistent as technically possible across all different platforms. See Frog head above.\n\n## **WHICH NOUN AND WHEN**\nI will deliver between 10 and 20 heads per month, released on the three platforms simultaneously as they are created. I will create community requested heads first, and otherwise will craft the traits that I think will be the most successful. \nüëâHere is an open To-do if you want to add your favorite traits to the list: \nhttps://www.notion.so/Filters-List-1b12bdc8b51e42f4b726b650b3784f7a\n\n![](https://imgur.com/lrjR7ac.jpeg)\n\n###### Potential AR Filters candidates \n\n## **COMPENSATION**\nFor the Prophouse winning rounds, I suggested 4 filters for 2 ETH, when ETH was around 1800-2000 USD. The market price for such 3D AR lenses sits between 1500-5000 USD per filter. \nFor reference, [this MAYC filter I created](https://www.instagram.com/ar/1025321405001469/) was commissioned by LollaPalooza for Snapchat and IG and was around 5k USD - It is a little more complex with many eyes and snot coming out of the nose.\n\nWith ETH currently around 1200 USD, I adjusted the price to 3 filters for 2 ETH, around 800 USD.\n\n- Setting up the geometry and creating the expressions system for each of the 37 heads in Blender.\n**(37/3) * 2 = 24.7**\n\n- Porting the geometry to TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, setting up the animation triggers and publishing to these platform with consistent tagging and video previews.\nI am estimating this work at 0.18 ETH per filter for a total of 137 filters.\n**(50 on TikTok + 50 on Instagram + 37 on Snapchat) * 0.18 = 24.7**\n\nThis brings the total ask at **49.4 ETH** with an average price of 0.36 ETH per filter. \n\n---\n\n## **ETH ADDRESS**\n\n0x9c74aE08Fd4337E14786f086D911E964df35e623\n\n## **WHO I AM**\n\n![](https://imgur.com/jmO7FHf.jpeg)\n\nCoral Orca:\n- Community member \n- Early Nouncillor\n- 3D buildor: visualization with voxels, AR and VR, architecture and art. \n- [Prop 2](https://nouns.wtf/vote/2) we created [https://3dnouns.com](https://3dnouns.com/) with [0xFloyd](https://twitter.com/0xfloyd)\n- [Prop 126](https://nouns.wtf/vote/126) With [John Hamon](https://twitter.com/johnhamon_)\n\nHappy to be here, and build with my internet friends. \n\nThank you for reading this proposal!\n\nFeel free to tag me on Twitter or Discord to answer any questions.

      "content": "# Nouns X Everybody\n\n# TL;DR\n\nThis proposal will differentiate itself from other Nouns proposals aiming to create content for the Nouns (such as [165](https://nouns.wtf/vote/165), [113](https://nouns.wtf/vote/113) and [143](https://nouns.wtf/vote/143)) by focusing on creating an open process which will allow anyone to create a hype video.\n\nWhile this prop is similar to [Prop 180](https://nouns.wtf/vote/180) , they are very different in their process, scope and goals. Nouns X Everybody is more about the process itself (which could be applied to other areas, not just content creation). Additionally, although this proposal pays more to the winning submissions - it is doing so because it requires the team to produce AND distribute without a guarantee of payment. While the number of views are not everything, they do matter, as we can have the highest quality content in the world but it only matters if people see it. \n\nInstead of determining what we think people will want to see, this proposal will instead outline the guidelines in terms of output as well as the minimum result we want achieved in terms of outcome. Leaving it open for anyone to implement their own creative process in order to achieve that result.\n\nBy funding this the proposal we would hope to achieve the goals of:\n\n\n* Having a minimum of 10 pieces of original video content created, each with a minimum of 2k views on YouTube (20k total views minimum but I would expect much much more).\n* Getting new and innovative ideas from both from within and outside of our existing community by allowing them creative control on the output.\n* Bringing people into the Nouniverse as they will need to learn more about Nouns so as to create content which will enable them to win this challenge.\n* Showcase how the various elements of the DAO (see: ‚ÄòThe Process‚Äô) can be combined to create a cohesive process for project implementation.\n* Demonstrating a proposal process that brings benefit to the DAO and rewards creators while not requiring compensation for the proposer. With 86% going to content creators, 12% going to marketing and just 1% going to administration along with 1% earmarked for an independent report on effectiveness of the proposal after 9 months. \n\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n# THE BRIEF\n\n**Create a short hype video that either explains or pulls people into the Nouniverse and if your video gets over 2k views on YouTube before April 30th 2023 you could be awarded part of the $200k fund.**\n\nThe **Top 10 Videos** ranked by number of YouTube views that meet the minimum entry requirements below will be put up for a vote where **4 winners** will be selected and awarded **$50k each**.\n\n* Any person or team is free to submit an entry to this challenge. \n* To enter, simply create your video, upload it to YouTube and get people to watch it.\n\n___\n\n_**MINIMUM QUALIFYING CRITERIA**_ \n\n- Has more than 2000 organic views on Youtube by the end of the Submission Period\n- Must meet the brief (i.e. It either ‚Äòexplains the Nouns‚Äô or ‚Äòpulls people into the Nouniverse‚Äô)\n- Content must be original. While videos may reuse existing content if it is not mostly original it will not qualify.\n- Is positive in nature and is rated PG\n- Must be a video and not a YouTube \"shorts\"\n- Should include ‚Äò#EnterTheNouniverse‚Äô in the description (so we can easily filter submissions)\n\n\n---\n\nComplete creative freedom is given to entrants on how they want to achieve the goal ‚Äì it can be animated, live footage, a mixture of both or something completely different. Some teams might focus on higher end productions that explains Nouns to people while others might focus on something simple and unique that pulls people into the Nouniverse (i.e. see the different approach[ Coinbase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ9pNQrz0fA&ab_channel=AnthonyKalamut) had vs other cypto companies during the superbowl in trying to achieve the same result). It is up to the creator to do what they think will work.\n\n\n\n---\n&nbsp;\n\n## SELECTION CRITERIA\n\nThe **Top 8 Videos with the most views on YouTube + 2 Videos chosen by the Selection Committee** will be entered into the Voting Round ‚Äì where Noun holders will vote for the 4 winners of $50k each.\n\n\n\n* All videos must meet the minimum qualification criteria\n* Selected entries will be free to provide any additional information at this stage to be included in their entry which demonstrates why their content should win (for example, data from other social media platforms like Twitter, TikTok or any other measure of engagement)\n* Selected entries may be asked to provide information to the selection committee proving that their YouTube views were organic that the data has not been manipulated or paid for.\n* A person/team can submit as many entries as they want but only their best entry (which they can choose)  will be selected for the final vote.\n* We are including 2 videos selected by the committee due to the fact that some entries may not be in the Top 10 in terms of views of YouTube but may have merit for nomination through a disproportionate level of engagement on other channels and/or be of exceptional quality or have uploaded their video late in the process but has gained a lot of views in a short time period.\n---\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n# THE PROCESS\n\nIf this proposal is successful, the following process will take place:\n\n\n\n1. **Proposal Passes:** $200k and 25 Eth with be transferred to a multisig controlled by the Multisig. The challenge has officially started.\n2. **Submission Period:** There is a 5 Month window for anyone to create and publish their hype video.\n3. **Create Marketing Dept:** 25 Eth will immediately be used to fund a Prop House Round with 5 Eth being awarded to the 5 best proposals detailing how they will market and find entrants for this project. (see note at bottom)\n4. **Selection Period:** When the submission period has ended on April 30th 2023 there will be a 2 week selection period where the creators of the Top 10 videos will be invited by the Selection Committee to make their submissions. These submissions, including any additional information the creator wants to provide, will be uploaded to a Prop House round by the Selection Committee.The selection committee will be paid 3 eth for administering this.\n5. **Voting Round:** Nouns will have a 1 week voting period to cast their votes for the 4 winning submissions to be awarded $50k each.\n6. **Payment:** Funds will be distributed to the Winners by the Trusted Parties.\n7. **Analysis**: 2 eth will be earmarked for an indpedent evaluation of this proposal after 9 months. To see how effective it was at achieving the stated outcome. \n\n_**Important Note:** If no one meets the minimum qualifying criteria, the Nouns pay nothing (with the exception of the 25 eth used to fund the marketing dept prop house round) and all funds are returned to the Treasury. But for every person or team that does meet the criteria, we have at the very least a piece of original video content with more that 2k views on YouTube._ \n\n\n\n\n** **\n\n**Selection Committee:** The Selection committee will be comprised of 5 independent members of the Noun community, selected by Hindsight, whose job it will be: (a) select the Top 10 videos to be included in the final Noun vote as per the minimum qualifying criteria and the selection criteria above, (b) contact these creators to submit any additional information for the final vote and (c) upload those submissions to a Prop House vote.\n\nThe work of the selection committee is minimal and mostly administrative (checking that views are organic etc) and as such will only require 3 eth (of which I will get none).\n\n_In order to maintain independence and to ensure a fair process members of the selection committee cannot enter a video to the challenge_\n\n\n---\n\n**Stated Goals of this Proposal** \nIf this proposal passes, it success or failure will be measured against meeting the following criteria:\n* The creation of a minimum of 10 pieces of good quality, original content before April 30th\n* A minimum of 100k cumulative organic YouTube views across all content created in persuit of this prize before 9 months of this proposal passing\n___\n\n\n\n**Team** \nReally the point of this prop is that there is no 'team' but for the interest of transparency and to include a section I think should be in all props:\n* Hindsight: I am not a member of any other teams, councils or projects and I do not receive any compensation from any DAO source. I have no conflicts of interest and will not financially benefit from this proposal.\n* My only role will be to be on the multisig and to choose the selection commitee (A role I would be happy to give to someone else if they are suitable and want it!)\n\n\n---\n\n**Transaction Details**\n\n\n\n* 30 Eth will be transferred to fund a Prop House Round to create a marketing team for the challenge, the selection committee administration cost and the retrospective report on outcome.\n* $200k USD will be transferred to fund the prize pool.\n\n_If less than 4 teams do not meet the minimum qualifying criteria then any USDC that has not been used will be returned to the treasury._\n\n**Total Cost:** $200k + 30 Eth\n\n**Multisig**\n\nThe multisig is a 3/5 consisting of the 5 best looking members of the dao\n\n* [Hindsight](https://twitter.com/0Hindsight)\n* [Elad](https://twitter.com/eladmallel)\n* [Jarmen](https://twitter.com/jarmen43)\n* [Maty](https://twitter.com/matyETH)\n* [Adrianmcli](https://twitter.com/adrianmcli)\n\n___\n\n**A note on the 'Marketing Dept' creation**\n\n\nThe prop house round for 25 eth will award 5 submissions 5 eth to market this challenge and try and find people and teams outside both inside and outside of Nouns to make submissions. I will draft the prop house round if this proposal succeeds. An idea of submissions that will be encouraged are: contacting media schools, creating a landing pages with instructions, engaging with influencers to promote etc. \n\n___\n\n\n**Why YouTube Views**\n\n\nAs stated earlier, YouTube views are not everything, but they do matter and after looking at the view count of Nouns content I think we could benefit from a proposal with a proposal that has goals in terms of distribution as well as production. \n\nMany of these videos will have more views on Twitter and other platforms and I would expect the same from any video created for this challenge. But for the interest of managing the proposal we will have to set one medium as the primary one for measurement and I think YouTube is the most appropriate.\n\n2k views to reach the minimum entry requirement may seem small, and it is, but remember this is a MINIMUM, and we would expect any video that qualifies in the Top 10 to have many more views than that. \n\nHere you can see how many views Nounish content is currently getting on YouTube\n[![YT-V.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/XYSbwxm9/YT-V.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/bsTWP0zv)\n\nWhile some content that that use gimmicks, shows a lack of creativity nor effort, or does not show a clear comprehension of what the Nouns ecosystem is may meet the minimum qualifying criteria (whether due to the creator having large existing YouTube following or otherwise), ultimately the winning pieces of content be decided upon by a Nouner vote and so are extremely unlikely to be awarded anything for their efforts. So anyone who creates a video with the expectation of success should keep it classy and keep it Nounish.   \n",

      "content": "# Nouns Stories: Short Shorts\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mCy0tjV.png)\n\n\n## TL;DR\nA team of award-winning animators and executives in primetime animation have teamed up with Nouns Stories to commission 10 comedic Nouns shorts. \n\n\n---\n\n\n## Short Shorts - Season 1\n\nWe're commissioning 10 shorts for 6 ETH each. 5 of the shorts will be commissioned through a Prop House round. We will hand pick, and noun pill, five of our favorite creators to complete the other 5 shorts.\n\n**The Rules**\n1. The short must be funny.\n2. The short must be 15 seconds.\n3. The short must feature at least one Noun.\n\nProposers will submit a portfolio (or at least one example of previous work) + a 1 sentence creative pitch for their short.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nOnce the 10 shorts are complete we will plan for an entertaining online premiere, looking to collaborate with people in the Nouniverse, creators, and media outlets with established audiences. Then we will upload these to our own branded social media accounts and anywhere else on the internet that will showcase them. We will also provide the video files publically, allowing anyone to use them in future Nounish projects and news.\n\n**Awards**\n\nWe have an additional 20 ETH to award as prizes. We'll experiment with a variety of prizes and allocation methods including token gated Nounish community votes, live celebrity critic votes, and somehow we're going to get Goldy's dog to choose one prize winner. Also included will be a prize specifically for the best CC0 shorts to incentivize creators to release their content CC0.\n\nAll of our these additional prizes will be open to public submissions - artists not selected and funded through Prop House can create their short anyways and have another shot at competing for the prizes.\n\n**Branding**\n\n10 ETH is included to cover basic branding needed for this Prop House round. This could include logos, a simple website, a Nouns Shorts video bumper to play between shorts, etc. We will return any ETH we do not use to the treasury.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## Who is Nouns Stories\n**Stoopid Buddy**\n8 time Emmy-winning studio behind Robot Chicken & Nouns Documentary\n\n**Walter Newman**\nSVP at Adult Swim overseeing such shows as Rick & Morty, Robot Chicken, Smiling Friends, Lazor Wulf + Adult Swim shorts.\n\n**Pixel**\n[Goldy's](https://twitter.com/Goldypix) Oscar Shortlisted hybrid production studio are behind [nounish ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®](https://twitter.com/nounish) and the soon-to-be-released  animated short film \"[The Wizards Hat](https://twitter.com/nouns_stories/status/1570433066900017152?s=20&t=T_vYbAun_YQEsZUlEwfjSA)\" from the original Nouns Stories proposal. \n\n**Joshua Fisher**\nCreative manager, SharkDAO Rep, Ugly Noun, The Nouns Square Foundooor, NounsDAO Buildooor and Nouns narrative advocate.\n\n**Joel Cares**\nCEO of [Lobal Global](https://lobal.global/), video [Director](https://joelcares.net/), founding member of [Nouncil](http://nouncil.wtf/), creator of [Nerman](https://twitter.com/nermanbot).\n\n\n---\n\n## The Future\nSeason 1 is just the beginning. Nouns Stories will produce and release content through a Perpetual Original Content Machine that culminates in a robust animation and film ecosystem plus yearly Nouns Film Festival. \n\nShort Shorts Season 1 will give us a taste of what multi-hypenate creators can make with Nouns + inspire the next wave of storytellers to get involved for subsequent funding rounds.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wf8GaM0.jpg)\n\n(above: imagining a world where there are countless high quality Nouns style animated works to share)\n\n\n---\n\n## Funding\n\n**Total Budget: 90 ETH**\n - Prop House Shorts Round - 30 ETH\n - Team Commissioned Shorts - 30 ETH\n - Branding Elements - 10 ETH\n - Prizes - 20 ETH\n\n**Admin Costs**\n - 0 ETH  - the team will forgo compensation in this pilot round\n\n**Funding Sources:**\n - **27 ETH** from Nouns Stories:\nAdditional funds were left over from [Prop 20](https://nouns.wtf/vote/20).

It‚Äôs like Adult Swim on a dozen espresso shots, in one-minute-or-less episodes, released as 1/1 NFTs.\n\nThis is an opportunity to expand Nouns DAO culture by unleashing highly visible artist-created, community-developed CC0 video content that can be distributed everywhere. It‚Äôs also a brand-new way to use web3 tooling to release episodic videos, and an opportunity to pioneer a decentralized media production model that can help inform the future of entertainment. \n**takes a breath*\n\nRead on and watch the below video to learn more.\n\n[![Worst Case Decision](https://cdn.hashku.com/wcd/Nouns_WCD_Pitch_vid_screenshot_1500x.jpg)\n](https://vimeo.com/772223496/a53f2e2dad \"Worst Case Decision\")\n\n\n## What‚Äôs Worst Case Decision?\nWorst Case Decision is maybe the first episodic ‚Äúshow‚Äù to be released as an NFT series.\n\nEach season of WCD features 7 bite-sized fever dreams that are handcrafted into 30-70 second ‚Äúepisodes.‚Äù Every episode chases surreal characters along a bat-shit hyper-casual narrative that loosely follows a theme. So far we‚Äôve explored themes such as ‚Äúmayonnaise portal,‚Äù ‚Äúeveryone is wet,‚Äù ‚Äúhi-fi asparagus rain,‚Äù and ‚Äútoo many cats,‚Äù to name a few.\n\nThe show‚Äôs vibe feels like surfing in a sea of technicolor absurdity, with a low-fi, internet-infused, stop-motion animation style. Video, painting, web3, DALL-E, comedy, commerce‚Ä¶ WCD has it all. (Scroll to the bottom of this proposal to view sample episodes.)\n\n**Worst Case Decision Quick Facts:**\n\n* 50 Seasons planned, 7 episodes per season (350 episodes total)\n* Episodes released episodically as 1/1 video NFTs via worstcasedecision.com\n* Each season features an ever-changing cast of characters and collaborators\n* NFTs can be purchased with credit card and digital currency (ETH)\n\n## What makes this exciting for Nouns DAO?\nWe‚Äôre at the dawn of a new era for entertainment‚Äîone that will enable audiences and creators to build sustainable models of cultural production together. As perhaps the first-ever serialized 1/1 NFT video collection, Worst Case Decision is taking a pioneering approach to launching meme-y, weird, funny narrative shorts with and for the communities who believe this kind of art should exist in the world. \n\nBeyond pioneering this new web3-native episodic production model, there are a few specific benefits that Nouners can expect from supporting this project:\n\n**Noun-ified Episodes**\nThe entire season will be built based on decentralized creative direction by opening up key decisions to the Nouners (and in some cases the internet at large, for max visibility). This includes community input/voting on:\n* The ‚Äúthemes‚Äù of each episode\n* Protagonists (I‚Äôve got so many weird character ideas, man)\n* Supporting cast (really, so many weird characters)\n* Episode backgrounds\n\n**CC0 Content & Nouns Memes**\nThe Nouns season of WCD will be entirely CC0. This means that anyone can meme the shit out of the entire season, which will be full of Nouns references, noggles, and other inside jokes specific to Nouns‚Äô community, culture, and lore. Cut up and re-mix the episodes however y‚Äôall see fit, and post wherever you want.\n\n**Additional Benefits to Nouns DAO**\n\n1)\t**Major marketing and PR exposure.** This is a first-of-its-kind video collection in the NFT space, and there‚Äôs ‚Äúa lot of press to be had.‚Äù\n2)\t**WCD is planned for 50 seasons.** Nouns would be the 3rd season of 50, and the first-ever sponsored season‚Äîrepresenting an early entry into supporting what could become a historic release.\n3)\t**Introduce Marc‚Äôs audience to Nouns.** I‚Äôve been an independent artist for 25 years, and as a result I‚Äôm decently well known. I can help bring the fine art world‚Äôs attention to Nouns and web3 at large.\n4)\t**Reach non-web3-savvy folks, too.** Our tech partner [Hashku](https://hashku.com) has both crypto-native and custodial credit card minting solutions, meaning that non-crypto folks can participate in NFT auctions.\n\n![](https://cdn.hashku.com/wcd/nouns_pfp_collage%20copy_sm.jpg)\n\nThese are just mere examples of potential Nouns x WCD characters! Glorious, yes? Please feel free to take ‚Äòem and make ‚Äòem [your PFPs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Ff52SL1p3PGzdxYtCO7kyA9kpE2N4EAY?usp=share_link). (Shhhh‚Ä¶. there will be plenty more via https://nouns.build/ in the future.) \n\n## What makes this exciting for Collectors?\nI care immensely about my collectors. I want to add value and make the experience as fun and engaging as the episodes themselves. We have an expansive vision and are thrilled to include our collectors along this journey. \n\nIf you are a holder of a WCD episode from any season, you‚Äôll get access to:\n\n* My network via a private discord channel for collectors (a seat on the board so to speak)\n* Input on IRL WCD events\n* Early access to future WCD collabs and projects  \n\n## Marketing & Community Development\nOur philosophy for marketing and PR follows the vision for the project. Simply put: Our weird creative vision and IRL performances are going to cause some really interesting responses, which we‚Äôll engage with using our built-in strengths with social media and PR.\n\n**Marketing Plan**\n\n* **Launch activities** ‚Äì Our team will produce strategic content and a mix of online and IRL activations to generate as much pre-launch awareness as possible. We have an existing list of interested & interesting media partners to engage here. The web3 PR agency Serotonin is among them.\n*  **High-velocity engagement** ‚Äì A dedicated Project Ambassador will act as a marketing strategist, online social maestro, and Nouns champion, using multi-channel engagement tactics to build momentum. \n\n* **Partnerships & sponsorships** ‚Äì I (Marc) have a long history of partnering with brands to co-create projects. We will be bringing on some truly exciting collaborators and sponsors to spread the word even farther.\n\n* **Long-term community growth** ‚Äì Our desire is to make this project fully self-sustaining. To do this, our goal is to increase the performance of NFT auctions and overall engagement with the series by aggressively growing the WCD community. \n\n* **Transparent success metrics** ‚Äì We will track and analyze meaningful engagement metrics to keep the community informed on how we‚Äôre doing, and to strengthen our marketing approaches overall.\n\n## Open-Sourcing Our Promo Strategy\n\nWe wish to be as transparent as possible with our learnings about marketing and running this project. We‚Äôll create a public document outlining our goals, metrics, successes, and learnings so that our efforts can help future projects and the community at large.\n\n## Project Team\n\nIn addition to an amazing lineup of advisors, our core team currently consists of the following:\n\n**Marc Horowitz** // Creator & Visionary \n**Chris Coy** // Partner & Spiritual Advisor \n**Damien Newman** // Creative Consultant & Power Supporter \n**Matt Casanova** // Builder of Technologies\n**Hashku** // Minting Platform\n\n## Budget\nAnticipated activities and budgets (by phases):\n\n* **Pre-Production** ‚Äì $9,650\nStudio usage, lighting equipment, episode concepting/ production planning for all 7 episodes, props, backgrounds, art department (hand making all the noggles and weird other props).\n\n* **Production** ‚Äì $16,875 \nDirector fee, cinematographer/camera operator fee, additional creative direction and shoot crew/collaborators, daily incidentals during shoot (food, grip, etc), and production assistance.\n\n* **Post-Production** ‚Äì $11,500 \nSound finishing/sfx/sound design, music licensing, editing, smart contract customizations for specific season NFTs, season-specific website costs (video bandwidth and hosting). \n\n* **Promotion of Nouns + WCD Season (Outreach/Marketing/PR)** ‚Äì $17,475\nSpread the word about the Nouns DAO and its sponsored season of WCD via strategic editorial write ups, podcast appearances, live events, IRL media stunts/performances, and other activations TBD.  See further notes in ‚ÄúMarketing Plan‚Äù (above).\n\n\n**Total Budget** ($55,500) + price contingency: **50 ETH** (converted to USDC immediately) \n\n\n## Timeline & Logistics\n\n**Mid-late February, 2023:** Launch the project with unsponsored seasons 1 and 2.\n\n**Mid-January:** Collaborate with the Nouns community. Using voting mechanisms and other means of gathering community input, we will collectively shape WCD season 3.\n\n**Mid-late January:** Once our Nouns season is planned, each episode takes roughly 2 days to film and edit. That brings pre-production, production, and post-production to 3-4 weeks total.\n\n## How NFT Auctions Will Work on worstcasedecision.com\nEach season of WCD video episodes will be dropped over the course of a week (dates will be announced via [@marchorowitz](https://twitter.com/marchorowitz)).\n* Each day at 9am PST a new episode will drop on worstcasedecision.com\n* Each episode will be released as a 1/1 NFT \n* Each NFT‚Äôs auction will end at 8:55:59 am PST the following day\n* When one auction closes, the next one drops‚Äîand this continues for 7 days in a row, Mon‚ÄìSun.\n\n## The Future of WCD and Episodic NFTs\nWe have the team and vision required to evolve WCD into a genre-defining series. Beyond this, we think we‚Äôre onto something in regards to how serialized NFTs can be used as a sustainable model to fund the production of some truly weird and great videos‚Äîand other creations as well.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more and chatting with Marc and the team personally, please reach out and we‚Äôll have a chat ;)\n\n## Thank you, Nouners!\nIf I get the chance to collaborate with you all, I know we can make something really fun and amazing.

      "content": "# Explorer Grants - Trial\n\n![image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/b/be6270ef4049c16180cde5177b5c21ac878d1b7b_2_690x431.png)\n\n# Explorer Grants - Trial\n\n**Core Issue:** A lot of talented builders have Nouns on their radar, but are not sure how to contribute. The only place we actively incentivize them with ideas and funding is Prop House mandated rounds, which are retroactive, leaving builders who lose the round uncompensated for their work. Otherwise, they must figure out problems themselves and then ask for money, a difficult process if someone has no connections to the ecosystem.\n\n**Solution:** Create a program to actively recruit new talented builders and pro-actively fund them to explore the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n### TL;DR\n* 1 grant = 10 ETH for 2 months of exploration, goal for each builder is to have an on-chain prop by end of the period\n* 5 builders (50 ETH total) in first trial run\n* 3 members on operations team (mrtn, jihad, dot), lightly compensated; 2 more on multi-sig (yitong and krel)\n* Transparency is key\n\n### Eligibility\n- Must NOT be actively or recently funded by Nouns, or clearly an existing participant in the Nouns ecosystem\n- Must be new to the broader Nouns ecosystem\n- Must be working / actively exploring _something_ directly related to NounsDAO while on grant, or it will be revoked\n- Preference for people who can proactively create independently ‚Äî particularly engineers, but also content creators, designers, writers, etc\n\n### Operation Details\nThe entire process will be transparent via a public Discord and run by the 3-person team, who will be lightly compensated to do this work, ensuring accountability and commitment. Our initial proposal had no funding for the team, but we were recommended otherwise by Nouners.\n\n**Public Application:**\n* Explorer Grants will be publicized via Twitter, 1:1 outreach from the team and its network, Twitter Spaces with Nouns community organizations, Discords, etc\n* Candidates will submit public applications, showing past work and motivations for exploring the Nouns ecosystem, as well as a couple problem spaces that interest them\n  * These applications will also benefit the community at large who can recruit builders from this group\n* Candidates will largely be assessed on talent, potential, and excitement about Nouns. Reasoning for accepted candidates will be made public. The 3-person team will decide on 4 final candidates to accept.\n* 1 slot in the program will be allocated to a Nouns community vote\n\n**Program:**\n* 10 ETH for 2 months of part-time exploration for each builder\n  * *Detail: Overpaying slightly is critical to attracting talent that may not otherwise come to us. We are targeting people who make more than $150,000 a year in their full-time job*\n* Weekly check-in call with builders. Members of the Explorer Grants team will help them explore ideas, connect them to Nouners and builders, and lead workshops\n* **End of Program Objective:** each builder submits an on-chain or Prop House prop for continued funding\n\n### Team\n* **mrtn, lead organizer:**\n    * Previously a PM at Google and NBA Top Shot, he has now contributed to a variety of Nounish projects - Nouns Builder, AI Pod, Agora, as well as doing a 24 Hour Nounish live stream, and receiving a Governance Historian grant. At USC, he ran an organization that guided students towards entrepreneurship, whose members include several YC startups. He's a big believer in diversifying funding sources for Nouns builders, and experimenting with the patronage model. *Comp: 3 ETH / month*\n* **jihad, community & product expert:**\n    * Core contributor at Forefront, creating media and building infrastructure for tokenized communities. He is also a delegate and ‚ÄúLil Nouncilor‚Äù at Lil Nouns DAO, a contributor to Public Nouns, one of the winners of the recent Nouns Agora delegate race, and is part of the team building [Adjectives](nouns.terminal.co), an analytics and proposal evaluation platform for Nouns DAO. Jihad believes that Nouns must be a center of excellence for tokenized communities, and the Explorer Grants program would be a step in the right direction in attracting the brightest minds to do focused yet unstructured work in the Nouns ecosystem. *Comp 2 ETH / month*\n* **dot, technical expert:**\n    * Dot is an iOS dev turned nounish builder - a founding member of Nouncil and most recently Lil Nounder at Lil Nouns DAO; the first full fork of Nouns DAO. Dot started Lil Nouns as a way to expose nouns to as many people as possible. Lil Nouns DAO leverages its 8 nouns alongside its own treasury to fund and support public goods built by lil nouners. In doing so, Lil Nouns has become a builder onramp to Nouns DAO itself. *Comp: 2 ETH / month*\n\n***We will use a 3 of 5 multi-sig, with the core team members as well as krel and yitong.***\n\n### Questions\n**How will you actually find these builders?** Our team has fairly deep networks within the crypto and broader tech space; we'll leverage our personal connections as well as our social media presence to find more builders. Additionally, a large appeal of programs like these (Thiel Fellowship, Prop House, MacArthur Grants) is the benefit of continued funding + prestige, which we intend to lean into.\n\n**But what if the builders don't do anything?** This is similar to everything in Nouns already - there's a social contract to uphold, someone could always dissapear after receiving 200 ETH on-chain. We can setup the grant via Sablier to revoke if a builder goes MIA, however.\n\n**What will they actually build?** The first round will not have a particular mandate but future ones could be structured closer to Prop House mandated rounds, where there is a theme. We believe that time and freedom is key to allowing talented builders to find something meaningful to build long-term.\n\n**Why not just run this on Prop House?** Decisions are not always best made by large committees. Prop House rounds do not allow for deep conversation and analysis of candidates. A transparent, small committee allows for depth and betting on candidates who might not otherwise get a shot (i.e. people who aren't good at writing a description on prop house but would be amazing builders). Additionally, we'd like to create a long-term relationship with these builders via an organized cohort.\n\n**What if no good work comes out of this?** That's a possibility, as is the case with prop house rounds. However, we believe that Nouns already has a great enough brand to attract solid builders. However, if nothing goods comes out of this trial, then we will have learned that pro-active grants for attracting builders is not a valid technique for our DAO. If there are takeaways, they can be adapted into other funding sources, like Prop House or NSFW in the future.\n\n**Why are you being paid?** Our initial proposal did not include payment for the team, but it was suggested by Nouners that we should be getting paid to create accountability, as well as allow us to dedicate more time in making this more of a full-fledged program than one-off grants with no support from us.\n\n### Total Funding\n5 Builders x 10 ETH = 50 ETH\nTeam Comp: 14 ETH\nTotal: 64 ETH\n\n***Questions?

      "content": "# Nouns funding ZachXBT\n\n[@ZachXBT](https://twitter.com/zachxbt) is a public good serving the crypto ecosystem through tireless research exposing [countless scams](https://investigations.notion.site/). Recent events have highlighted the dire need and importance of such work. This prop proposes to fund 100 ETH to their donation address: zachxbt.eth (address can be verified from their twitter profile).\n\nDonations have always been somewhat controversial within Nouns governance. [Prop 21](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) donating 169 ETH to Gitcoin grants was one of the most contentious votes in our early history. [Prop 108](https://nouns.wtf/vote/108) donating 500 ETH to Ethereum protocol development (via the Protocol Guild) was much more unanimous but still there was discomfort and discourse around whether the DAO was becoming \"a tax inefficient way for DAO members to make donations.\" \n\nI agree that we shouldn't resort to becoming a complacent vehicle of passive philanthropy. We should instead aim to actively contribute and be a net producer of public goods ourselves such that our meme (brand) can fully capture the provenance value (claim on originality of) the public work and thus leverage the virtuous cycle to do more than what capital alone could have done. However, there should be exceptions to this rule if there is an urgent and common public cause that warrants highlighting. I would like to suggest that this is such a case. Crypto needs more validators like ZachXBT.\n\nWith donations we need to be extra wary of conflicts of interest or self-dealing. Unfortunately there is no way to prove this cryptographically, but I attest that I have no prior (or planned future) relationship with ZachXBT and that today was the first time I contacted them (via twitter) to ask for their permission to make this proposal.

Periodically, I've seen a tonne of contests hosted by our nounish communities such as [coloring book contests](https://nounsarchive.wtf/portfolio/nounsense-02) by Noun22 & Messhup, [memes contests](https://nounsarchive.wtf/portfolio/noadz-valentines-day) by Noadz, and is now mainly being held by the [Noun Square](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare) team. We have seen full of delightful contest submissions with all sorts of genres from all across the world.\n\nI took an initiative to build a website where we can display all of the entries from NounsDAO's contestants because I personally feel it is very important for the DAO to do so. Additionally, it provides access to all future possibilities. \n\nAs time passes, I feel it needs to grow even more by including all of the Nouns projects from the community and not only the contestants. Our memes proliferations are all contained inside.\n\nWhy is it important to document and archive these things?\n\n> \"The body continuously explores time and space. It holds our history, if we listen closely.\" -Chloe Chotrani\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/aDIU2rB.jpg)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n* **Long-term Vision** ; \n    * To retain past and future historical key data of all talented builders & artists that contribute around Nouns ecosystem.\n\n* **Objective** ; \n    * 1) To help **onboard newcomers** that are interested in Nouns so they can catch a **glimpse** of what the project is all about. Navigation will be improved through enhanced visual design to create a stronger first impression.\n    * 2) **References that act as inspiration**. Drawing from references is beneficial because it provides our imaginations with tangible things to model after.\n    * 3) To create potential opportunity for artists / builders to receive **commissions or collaborative works/projects** with others.\n\n* **Strategy** ; \n    * 1) **Simplified TL;DR / streamlined landing page with upgraded visuals** consists of ; *to browse relevant areas & specific parameters* ;\n            * simplified projects/contests brief\n            * project owner/hosts\n            * total funded/prizes\n            * categories (*ex; art, community, tech, marketing, physical etc*)\n            * links to discourse/full props/related infos/contests\n            * social media (*ex; twitter, discord*)\n            * tags / filters *(most recent, oldest, alphabetically)*\n            * distinct project images with descriptions\n            * status\n            * contest winners\n            * CC0 label together with proof of CC0 (*ex; toggle/submit forms etc*)\n            * search bar with data points\n            *( all are shown under **Details**)*\n\n    * 2) **Coordinate with other existing platforms** already in place (ex. ***[nouns.center](https://nouns.center/), [proposal.wtf](https://maty-eth.notion.site/maty-eth/NounsDAO-Proposals-Overview-b8c76e6ac8e44515966ee032ea20f860), [nounish](https://twitter.com/nounish)***) by pooling resources & efforts for maximum efficiency and also to complement each other.\n    * 3) **Contents sustainability** ; we will be using Notion for the database and will be publically viewable. Content submission form with formats will be available for community use. An additional idea is to work with Nouns AI team for data scraping by using certain hashtags/keywords *(to be discuss)*.\n    * 4) **CC0 Contents & Icon** ; any artist can **enable or declare** their work to be CC0 by submitting forms that will be made available soon. It is freely usable by anyone for remixing and other creative purposes. A \"CC0\" icon will appear that contains additional proof of CC0.\n    * 5) A **daily dose of nounish things** ; daily curated posting of one random nounish project to give more **visibility & brand consistency** for long term goals.\n    * 6) Main whiteboard to organise works ; [Nouns Archive's FigJam](https://www.figma.com/file/g1etPE6nK6WtwK35i9C8gs/Nouns-Archive?node-id=0%3A1).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YtMFFYJ.jpg)\n\n* **Measuring Success** ; \n    * 1) We are tracking using Google Analytics and will factor in a monthly report & insights of the website.\n    * 2) As per *image* attached, it is an event count for 2 months. \n    * 3) Organic views and engagements will always be the baseline metrics, but currently, **85%** of the contents are exclusively focus on contest entries. We anticipate that the graph will eventually be higher once we have completed building an MVP jointly across all nounish projects.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/C8Iu47E.png)\n\n\n* **Deliverables** ; \n    * 1) Empower existing website, [nounsarchive.wtf](https://nounsarchive.wtf/) as per whole new concept interface attached above.\n    * 2) **On-the-go** website with comprehensive materials, including numerous projects and submissions.\n    * 3) As per said under ***Strategy***.\n    * 4) Biweekly reports and updates on new developments on discourse & social media (*twitter & discord*).

      "content": "# PropBox: A Nouns Proposal Incubator\n\n## TL;DR\n\nUsing lessons from a Nouncil trial program, we will set up a robust incubator that will help the best builders in the ecosystem smoothly navigate the Nouns DAO proposal process.  \n\n**Our goal is to leverage the breadth and depth of skillsets within UglyDAO to help nounish builders communicate well and find pathways to funding, so that they can keep doing what they do best:** \n\n**BUILDING.**\n\n[![andrew-propbox.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/fbwksjjM/andrew-propbox.gif)](https://vimeo.com/774011051/886e16a979)\n*Click to watch a 3 minute video summary of this proposal.*\n\n# The Challenges\n\n\n\n1. **The Nouns DAO Proposal Process Can be Daunting to New Builders.**\n    \n    Writing a proposal is difficult. Conveying a good idea in a way that voters can understand and relate to is even more difficult.  With the increased number of proposals and ideas coming in weekly, it‚Äôs more important than ever to effectively communicate one's idea and value proposition.  For some builders, proposal writing may not be a core strength. So their proposals may fail on-chain, even if the core concept is valuable.\n    \n2. **Effective Communication with DAO Voters is Difficult**\n    \n    One of the most difficult challenges for builders in the Nouns ecosystem has always been figuring out how to have open dialog with voting Nouners and Delegates. These challenges will only increase as the DAO grows. Now, with the Official Nouns Discord closed, this is an even more pressing issue. \n    \n3. **Constructive and Honest Feedback is Rare**\n    \n    Very few people within Nouns are giving truly honest and constructive criticism to proposals that need work. Discourse and Nouncil feedback sometimes can be ‚Äúsoft‚Äù, as people may not want to publicly discuss the potential pitfalls of a fellow community member‚Äôs idea or hurt their feelings.  We see this occurring more frequently with on-chain proposals, and it doesn‚Äôt help anyone in the long run.\n\n\n\n[![boxbrain.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/14xN6w0Y/boxbrain.gif)](https://postimg.cc/wRVvYtGh)*Think INSIDE the box!*\n\n\n# Our Solutions\n\n**PropBox will aim to solve the above pain points in the following ways:**\n\n1. Ugly Dao has a talented roster of builders, many of whom have experience writing successful proposals for Prop House, NSFW and on-chain. We also have professionals with experience in the legal, marketing, education, and communications fields. With our combined training and experience, we can help builders create proposals that make an impact. Additionally, sometimes the most difficult part of seeking funding from Nouns is **knowing where to go.** We can help proposers understand if their idea is best suited to a Prop House round, an NSFW pitch, a discussion with the newly minted DCS Pod, or a full on-chain proposal. Finally, we believe that proposals should lean on multimedia content to achieve maximum impact in an attention-scarce environment. We want to help builders integrate engaging videos and visuals into their proposals.\n\n2. We know the Nouns community like the back of our Ugly hand, and can help new builders navigate the difficult task of amplifying the message of their proposal. From appearances on The Noun Square, discussions in Nouncil or other Nounish discords, as well as conversations on Twitter, Discourse, House of Nouns and elsewhere, we know how to help builders with the most difficult part of getting funded for a proposal: **Communicating directly with the people who ultimately will vote yes or no.** \n\n3. The DAO needs more well-intentioned people who are not afraid to give would-be builders The Ugly Truth, and we are prepared to do so.\n\n\n# The PropBox Value Prop\n\nOur goal is to become the premier resource to help builders create great proposals and find pathways to funding in the Nouns ecosystem. We plan to find and incubate teams and projects from multiple sources, including:\n\n- Current builders in the ecosystem who are looking for feedback and help navigating the proposal process.\n- New builders who need extra help onboarding into Nouns, writing proposals, and making the right connections to be successful.\n- ‚ÄúUncut gems‚Äù from Prop House and Discourse to fund proof of concept projects and prepare the teams for potential larger on-chain proposals in the future. We aim to find builders with the highest potential and help them fulfill that potential. Ideas from this category should have at least 10x potential from the amount of initial funding.\n\n# The Origin Story\n\nThis project began as an initiative by [Andrew ](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/andrewladdusaw.eth)[Laddusaw](https://twitter.com/AndrewLaddusaw), through [Nouncil](https://discord.gg/nouncil), following the [Combinator Round in Prop House](https://prop.house/nouns/open-round:-25-eth) back in July (aka ‚Äúthe before times.‚Äù) Andrew saw a lot of talented teams that submitted great proposals, but of course the round only had one winner for the 25ETH prize. \n\nHe began contacting builders and building a system within Nouncil Discord to give these teams feedback to prepare them for an on-chain proposal, or to help them secure alternative funding sources. When they began reviewing proposals publicly as a group, other builders asked for help as well.\n\nDuring this initial trial, the Incubator team gave feedback to 9 proposals. Through that process: One secured funding through NSFW. One pursued another Prop House to fund a proof of concept, won, and later joined Nouncil. One ended up abandoning the initial idea, but moved on to other projects during the incubation process, and has now been funded for multiple other projects within the DAO (shout out [ripe0x](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/ripe0x.eth).) Two other proposals ended up with on-chain votes, one narrowly being defeated and one securing funding for 40 ETH (Prop 144 for One Click Bots). \n\n[![andre-testimonial.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/JnndSt6P/andre-testimonial.gif)](https://vimeo.com/774010662/b852cb4533)\n*Click to watch a 2 minute PropBox testimonial video from Andrei (BotFrens)*\n\nWe learned a lot through this experiment. We‚Äôre continuing to follow up with the builders as they hone their ideas, and expect to see even more fruit from these efforts in the coming months. We‚Äôre also continuing to improve our feedback process and we believe we‚Äôre ready for the next phase of growth.\n\n\n# The Timeline\n\n**This proposal will support the PropBox team for a 3 month period to do the following:**\n\n- Actively locate builders in the ecosystem to help drive their ideas forward and guide them through the proposal process that is most appropriate to their ideas and building stage.\n- Create an active Builder‚Äôs Guild in the PropBox Discord, where those who are creating tools and proposals can do so in the open, and together. This well help create consistent startup energy in the Nouns community.\n- Review every Discourse, and various Discord community posts, making sure everyone submitting proposal ideas gets quality feedback and the best possible Nouns experience when they first arrive in the community. One of our greatest desires is that new, talented builders would not leave the community discouraged after getting negative feedback, simply because they didn‚Äôt understand the funding process or the culture of what it means to be a part of Nouns.\n- Create a website to house a toolkit of templates, best practices, tips and tricks, and contact information giving builders a toolbox to maximize success.\n- We will also spend the next three months exploring several ideas, which we will present to the community at the end of the proposal funding period:\n    - *How to potentially make an incubator like this self-sustaining in the future.*\n    - *A system to temperature check proposals and gather feedback from as many sources as possible, including from those with the most likelihood to swing vote outcomes.*\n    - *How to create efficiencies in the proposal process, so that new community members can transition from their first interactions to building as effectively as possible within the DAO.*\n    - *Exploring systems of trust-building to make sure that scammers are not able to abuse the treasury through gaming or fraud.*\n    - *Decisions about what form this group should take in the future; how to incorporate new members, ideas, and processes to maintain the highest degree of quality feedback, help, and value to the DAO.*\n\n\nAll of the above is to serve the ultimate goals of PropBox: \n\n**To help builders write high quality proposals, and to make decision-making simpler and less time-consuming for DAO members.**\n\n# The Budget\n\n**75ETH** **Total**\n\n- **60 ETH** - In our trial, we were able to achieve a great deal of success with people who were just volunteering their time. We know that with DAO funding, we will have much more capacity to onboard talented builders and incubate many more proposals. \n    - **20 ETH** per month as a payment to team members, to be paid retroactively based on work completed and builders helped. This work will include engaging builders at every stage of the proposal process, guiding them, and helping to write effective and media-rich proposals. These team rewards will be distributed via biweekly Coordinape rounds (Nouncil model.) All payment data will be publicly available to the DAO. \n    - Our team goal will be to engage with a minimum of 30 builders about their proposals over the course of a 3 month period. \n    \n- **10 ETH** for a pool to fund some small projects, as an experiment in additional targeted flexible funding for the DAO: Taking small ideas that we encounter through the process of our work and helping those teams to execute small ideas or create MVPs of larger ones. \n- **5 ETH** of retro funding for what has been done to build this system already.\n\n# The PropBox Team\n\nWe are a group of Nounish builders that have created and executed successful proposals at every funding level. We are consistently active in Discourse, offering constructive feedback and working privately with builders to help them formulate effective proposals and seek funding. We are passionate about great ideas, effective communication, and robust proposals that drive the nounish meme forward. ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\n[![propbox-group-shot-smaller.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qvQ8CwwZ/propbox-group-shot-smaller.png)](https://postimg.cc/ZWB9Gr1r)\n\n- ***Lead: [Andrew Laddusaw](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/andrewladdusaw.eth)***\n- ***Core Team:***\n***[BradQ](https://twitter.com/iambradq)***\n***[ProfWerder](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/profwerder.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)***\n***[SuperTightWoody](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/supertight.eth)***\n***[Toady Hawk](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)***\n\n***Support: Other UglyDAO Members***\n*18 super builders and counting with diverse skills and talents who are passionate ambassadors for Nouns inside and outside of the community*\n\n**Multisig:**\n*Funds will be transferred to and held in a 3/5 Gnosis Safe (propboxvault.eth) with the 5 trusted Nouns community members above.*\n\n# The Bottom Line\n\nWe believe the DAO needs to attract more awesome builders, and needs teams of diligent people finding good ideas and helping them to bloom into full-fledged, effective Nounish initatives. \n\nWe are uniquely qualified to help these builders write awesome proposals, strategize ideal funding paths, and facilitate DAO communications, and we are asking for a mandate to do exactly that. \n\n## Think INSIDE the Box, vote YES for Prop 175!

      "content": "# Proposal tracking by maty\n\n**TLDR**: Fund maty to continue tracking all funded [proposals](http://www.proposal.wtf) (46 ETH saved) and writing [newsletters](https://nouns.substack.com/) (over 16k views) for 5.5 ETH/month.\n\n## About me\nActive in nouns every day for a year, founding Nouncil and Esports Pod member, Discord mod (rip), NSFW team member... but most of my work has been centered around a weekly newsletter and proposal tracking dashboards I have created in Notion.\n\n## Tracking proposals\n**Problem:**  It's hard to follow individual projects after they get funded, the information is scattered. Accountability is important.\n\n**Solution:** \n- I'm following up with builders of all funded projects, providing a way for builders to share all the awesome work they've done\n- Saving the data to Notion [proposal.wtf](http://www.proposal.wtf) - 5 interconnected dashboards with all the important info, allows anyone to quickly and easily search for any project, filter and sort them based on various properties or see all projects by a particular builder.\n\nThanks to these follow-ups, I have contributed to **46 ETH being returned to the DAO** (from 2 proposals with leftover funds).\n\n**Future focus:** \n- Getting cleaner-looking dashboards up on nouns.center (in collaboration with cdt, you can already find the Communities list we made [here](https://nouns.center/groups))\n- Working with the Agora team to display relevant information in Agora profiles\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1sdJQWz.gif)\n\n\n\n\n## Newsletter \n**Problem:** Information overload, hundreds of funded projects + even more seeking funding. With the dissolution of the official Discord server, this only got worse.\n**Solution:** \n- Weekly [newsletter](https://nouns.substack.com/) highlighting the biggest things happening around nouns, showcasing new proposed projects, new on-chain proposals, art, and more. Serves as an information distribution mechanism and as a historical snapshot of the DAO. [*Example*](https://nouns.substack.com/p/raising-from-the-ashes).\n- Special posts for Prop House rounds with TLDRs of all proposals (and other functions when needed) everything in one place, easy to read. [*Example*.](https://nouns.substack.com/p/prop-house-special-nouns-launchpad-9da)\n    - this helps us more effectively deploy capital via Prop House\n- Newsletter data:\n    - over 50 posts already (6 a month on average), with **over 16,000 reads** in total!\n    - latest posts get around 350-400 readers\n    - subscriber count is in a steady uptrend from the start, currently at 430\n\n**Future focus:**\n- highlighting the newly emerging communities\n- special posts with big proposal updates (highlights of changes from the dashboards)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/c54uvvl.gif)\n\n\n## Funding\nPreviously my work has been funded via NSFW (monthly, based on the amount of work, 4.5-5.5 ETH), but since now I am an active member of NSFW, I am seeking funding via on-chain proposal.\nI am asking for **5.5 ETH a month** for 7 months:\n- 1 month retro for October (7 newsletter posts, maintaining the dashboard and adding a new one - Communities/Groups)\n- 6 months going forward, paid via Sablier stream (until the end of April)\n- A total of 38.5 ETH",

      "content": "# Sail Nouns in the New York Harbor for NFT.NYC 2023\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PHkFAtJ.jpg)\n\n### TL;DR\n - Fleet of seven J/24 sailboats with Nounish sails and one bigger sailboat\n - Photo and video opportunities in front of Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge, Statue of Liberty\n - 100 guests onboard will actively participate by steering boats and trimming sails \n - Post-event meetup at the Manhattan Yacht Club‚Äôs clubhouse\n\n# Description\n\n### Why Sailing?\nI ([fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev)) have been sailing for 11 years and recently combined my passion for sailing and love of Nouns by organizing a regatta through Seoul (funded by [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102)). Sailing is one of the most prestigious sports and often gets attention of the media, guests, and residents. It's enjoyable to participate in, to watch live, and creates beautiful images and video to share.\n\n\n### Nouns in the New York Harbor\nNFT.NYC is only four months away. Most likely NFT and web3 projects are going to run the same promotions with posters and billboards. *Why not make something different?*\n\nFollowing the success of [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102), I would like to organize a sailing event on April 9th in New York with help of Manhattan Yacht Club. The NFT.NYC sailing event is going to be order of magnitute larger to match the gravity of the legendary New York.\n\n\nI will put together a fleet of seven J/24 sailboats and one bigger sailboat in New York bay with Nounish sails. We are going to invite Nounish people and sail together from New Jersey to Manhattan, Brooklyn Bridge, and the Statue of Liberty.\n\nWe'll be using J/24 sailboats for this event because it is the world's most popular one-design keelboat. It is a classic Porsche of sailing and respected by all sailors. It is easy to sail and looks beautiful when you get up the Nounish spinnakers.\n\n\n### Interactive Community Building\nThe plan is to make teams of 3 experienced sailors and 3-4 guests for each boat. The guests will be able to actively participate by steering boats and trimming sails. We are going to use one bigger boat to accomodate all guests and swap guests on boats near the Statue Of Liberty so all the guests can get full experience. 100 people will be invited, with priority to for the Nouns community. 20 invitations will be sent to special NFT.NYC attendees (media, artists, etc.) \n\nIt is going to be unforgettable experience. Later, we can gather together at Manhattan Yacht Club's clubhouse and share a few beers.\n\nLet's enjoy early spring sailing in NYC together and use this unique opportunity as a team building and proliferating event. A lot of New Yorkers and visitors are going to see Nouns logos during NFT.NYC and posted on social networks.\n\n### Documentation\nAll events/locations before and during the event will be documented and all media will be regularly shared with the [nounish ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®](https://twitter.com/nounish) team and posted on social networks.\n\n----\n# Details\n\n### Event map\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ysZx8iI.png)\n\n### Nouns branded sail designs\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S7SfqsE.jpg)\n\nBased on sail inventory availabe at Manhattan Yacht Club, it would be best to buy both mainsail and spinnaker sails. The available at manhattan yacht club sails have mount gay rum logos and wouldn't look good during our photo ops.\n\nDiscussions on sail designs and upcomming events will be posted on twitter and nounish discord.\n\nAfter NFT.NYC, the sails will be shipped and stored in my yacht club, in korea for possible future Nounish events.\n\nThere are four different design options availbe\n1) same color fabric, red noggles\n2) same color fabric, different color noggles\n3) different color fabrick, red noggles\n4) different color fabric, different color noggles\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Jiz8Rn0.png)\n\nIMO most of the beautiful thing about nouns community is collective hacking, designing, and thinking. I would like to get feedback from community to find best sail designs. \n\n\n----\n# Budget\n### Nouns NFT.NYC sailing photo op & team building\nWe going to invite as many people as possible, starting with Nounish folks. The event would be a best way to proliferate Nouns and organize a team building event for Nounish people.\n- **$24,000** Chartering fees for 7+ boats at Manhattan Yacht Club\n    - I received quote of $3,800 per boat for a general public\n    - The price might go down after I send an official request from my yacht club\n- **$35,000** Nouns sails inventory for 7+ boats\n    - (branded spinnakers and mainsails)\n    - I wil keep all the sails safe for future possible events. For example, NFT.NYC sailing event in 2024!\n- **$10,000** Small travel grants for sailing teams comming from Seattle, San Francisco, Texas, Michigan, Maryland.\n    - We need experienced crew to operate sailboats.\n    - The plan is to make teams of 3 pro sailors and 3-4 guests per one boat\n- **$15,000** Safety and media motor boats etc\n    - It is very important to have a couple motor boats available for media or in the case of emergency\n- **$5,000** The big boat is going to accomodate more guests. Later, on the way back from the Statue Of Liberty, we aregoing to swap guests and give more people chance to experience J/24 sailing.\n    - NFT.NYC is a big event and we might want to invite a lot of interesting people to the Nouns sailing event\n    - Also, some parts of New York bay is no fly zone for drones so it would be best to put a few photographers on a bigger boat\n- **$15,000** photo/video team\n- **$5,000** Nouns branded t-shirts and caps to look like a true team (120 pcs)\n- **$5,000** BBQ, beers, and rum for after party at Manhattan Yacht Club\n- **$21,000** expenses for operations team including me; $7k per person (I will need at least two reliable people with sailing experience with me to organize 7+ sailboats, photo ops, coordinate everyone etc; getting ready venue and boats 2 days before the event; 2 days cleaning boats and packing everything after the event)\n- **$15,000** budget for unexpected expenses and price offset (we can use some money to make invitations, rent more sailboats, buy more sails, stickers for boats, add more safety measures, shipping or storage for sails after the event etc)\n- **$10,000** I would like to request a small compensation for my efforts to plan the event for next 3 months.\n\n**Total: $160,000 or ~134 ETH (1 ETH = $1,200)**\n\nWe are asking for $160,000. It is a lot of money but it is worth every dollar if you look at everything we are going to accomplish.\n\n----\n# Person in Charge\nI am [fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev), member of Nouncil, creator of [Prop 102](https://nouns.wtf/vote/102), sailing since 2011, and love Nouns Community.\n\n---- \n# Multisig\nThe receiving address is a Gnosis Safe with 4/6 signers.\n\n**Multisig address**: 0xAC2671bAaA44b79cA1Fb006750c684E5349d721b\n\n**Multisig signers:**\n1. **toady_hawk**: 0x5D802e2Fe48392c104Ce0401C7ECa8a4456f1F16\n2. **benbodhi**: 0x80826180A2629206E3499B5167aaC8440E3F87f6\n3. **adrianmcli**: 0xE7304bA0f157f2Ade94015934284b6704BC72911\n4. **Brennen**: 0xf8a065f287d91d77cd626af38ffa220d9b552a2b\n5. **142**: 0xE6232ed3436C4065D38D8BFdC8EA90858ecDfa69\n6. **fiveoceans_dev**: 0xDf6e59c6DF1E9500fd35A76FF4C62F9901E90019\n\n$160,000 USD = ~134 ETH (1 ETH = $1,200 USD)\nAdding 15% buffer for volatility: 154 ETH\n\n**Proposed Transaction**\n```\n0xAC2671bAaA44b79cA1Fb006750c684E5349d721b.transfer(\n‚ÄÉ154.0 ETH\n)\n```\n\n### Swap Plan\nUpon receipt of funds, signers will convert the ETH to $160,000 USDC.\n- Leftover ETH will be sent back to Nouns DAO treasury\n- $60,000 USDC will be sent to fiveoceans_dev's wallet upon conversion\n    - the money will be used to book sailboats, and pre-order sails \n- $100,000 USDC will be kept in the safe until all the details of the Nouns NFT.NYC sailing event are finalized and posted (date, event program, sail designs, invitations)\n\n",

We are now asking the DAO to fund us to bring Nouns Name Service to the next level.\n\nThe Nouns Name Service (nns.xyz) is a naming system that aims to empower communities and spread the nounish culture.\n\nThe main Top Level Domain of the Nouns Name Service is the .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® .\n\nJust as a .eth is resolved in yourname.eth, having a .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® will allow you to attach the Nouns DAO noggles to your on-chain identity and be resolved as yourname.‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® .\n\nnns-screen.png\nnns.xyz\n\nBackground\nThe Nouns Name Service (NNS) received 2 ETH in Prop House ‚Äì Round 2 (April 2022) as trial funding to prove out the concept and build our reputation as trustworthy builders in the ecosystem.\n\nAfter 4 months of work we delivered the first version of the NNS (nns.xyz) and in the first month post-launch, we have already created a powerful ecosystem of partners which allowed the NNS to be natively resolved across the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nXva8Rxz7.jpg\n\nSummary\nThis proposal will allow the NNS to build the infrastructure required to start phase 2 of our strategy: Expansion.\n\nIn particular, these are the main goals of this phase, which will be completed over a 5 months period:\n\nIntegrate the NNS into new DAOs, apps and marketplaces outside the Nouniverse.\nIntegration of an additional .nouns TLD that will help overcome .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® copy-paste problems on external apps making its applications more flexible and effective.\nCreate a DAO powered by Nouns Builder to empower the NNS Squad, our community of people who got their .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®, with an experimental treasury to reward members and finance new initiatives.\nBuild new utility tools around the NNS. The first in the pipeline is a nounish NNS version of EtherScan.\nLaunch the Nounish Club project to push proliferation in and outside the Nouniverse through a new experiment of community reward and participation.\nCreate a full documentation for end-users and developers expanding the ways in which they can integrate the NNS in their projects.\nStart the first experiments and collaborations for Phase 3.\nRequesting funding of 195 ETH to execute our Expansion Phase.\n\nFunds will be immediately converted in USDC to avoid volatility exposure of any kind.\n\nNNS-proposal-artwork-2.jpg\n\nHow the NNS started\nThe idea of the NNS originated from a question:\n\n‚ÄúIs there a way to transform a meme icon into a fully functional domain, where its utility grows proportionally to the meme adoption?‚Äù\n\nDuring the first months of work, this idea evolved from its very first draft on Prop House, letting the NNS become a possible solution to several interesting scenarios:\n\nIn an ecosystem based on CC0 like the Nouniverse, with a lot of new communities and sub-DAOs, the .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® could become a universal tool for companies and creators to interact with the entire ecosystem at once.\nHow so?\nThe power of a CC0 ecosystem is the proliferation of a main idea in many sub-projects and communities. In the Nouniverse, that idea is represented by the ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® meme. The noggles appear in every nounish community, but at the same time they are part of different NFTs and collections. At the moment, there isn‚Äôt a token that can unify the Nouns ecosystem at an infrastructural level. The .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® can fill this gap, allowing companies and creators to reach the whole ecosystem by simply integrating the NNS into their token-gated experiences and initiatives.\n\nThe more the NNS is integrated on new apps and marketplaces across the world, the more the .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® will help spread the nounish culture at an exponential level.\nHow so?\nThe NNS serves as an on-chain identity badge for all the people who share the nounish culture. Having your .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® attached to your web3 identity makes it clear that you belong to the ‚Äúnounish internet society‚Äù. The more the NNS will expand, the more the Nouns proliferation will reach places that wouldn‚Äôt even have been considered before.\n\nIn a market dominated by 2 titan projects and few TLDs, the NNS could become the first experiment of a collaborative naming system on ETH. This would allow other communities to join the NNS and create their own TLD on top of the NNS, making the whole protocol stronger and more widely adopted, and offering the new communities the advantage of having their TLD natively resolved across the NNS network from day 1.\nHow so?\nOnce the Nouns Name Service is globally recognised by important apps in the space, it could open its network to other communities as well. This way, communities will not only get their customized TLD (that‚Äôs nothing new), but this will be able to be natively resolved everywhere from the very beginning. This will literally onboard in the Nouniverse and in Nouns DAO whole communities made by end-users and talented builders, constantly bringing new ideas and improving engagement thanks to a proven system of funding based on Prop House, Small Grants and all the other nounish DAOs.\n\nIn a nutshell, for a community joining the NNS would mean not only having a naming infrastructure, but also being able to build and nurture important relationships in the Nouniverse that will push new ideas and collaborations with the entire ecosystem.\n\nThese applications, which at the moment represent our focus, will offer Nouns and the Nouniverse an important value in terms of proliferation, new users in existing nounish platforms and the attraction of new builders.\n\nAnd we are confident this is just the beginning of many other applications for the NNS.\n\nNouns-Name-Service-NNS-works.jpg\n\nRoadmap (The 3 Phases)\nBuilding this kind of Naming System is a big task. Which is why we split our development in 3 Phases. After the first one is completed, the NNS will be able to move to the next one, and so on.\n\nPHASE 1: Core Ecosystem and Community\nThe power of any protocol lies in its network.\nThat‚Äôs why our top priority since launch has always been to build a strong core ecosystem from which we can expand.\n\nWhile new naming systems often rely on external plugins to resolve their names, the NNS aims to create a network where every NNS name is natively resolved without any additional action by the users.\n\nAt the time of writing, the NNS has been supported by all the major nounish projects, officially connecting the Nouniverse.\n\nNouns-Name-Service-NNS-projects.jpg\n\nENS reservation period and stats:\n\nDuring the first 60 days after launch NNS names could only be claimed by their correspondent .eth.\n\nWhile this impacted the NNS growth in the very short term, it also allowed the early adopters to have full control of their identities, thus focusing more on identity than speculation.\n\nThe ENS reservation ended on 19 October 2022 with the following results:\n\n355 names claimed\n252 unique owners\nAs you‚Äôre reading this, after 4 months of development and 2 months of Reservation Period, Phase 1 is officially completed.\n\nAt this time, 2 weeks after the end of the Reservation Period, a total of 526 .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® names have been registered from 311 unique owners.\n\nnns-launch-artwork.jpg\n\nPHASE 2: Expansion and Nounish Club\nPhase 2 will start the real proliferation of the NNS.\n\nAs mentioned in the TL;DR, the Expansion phase will have several goals, starting from the integration of the NNS in new DAOs, apps and marketplaces outside the Nouns ecosystem, also solving the .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® current copy-paste issue.\n\nPart of the Expansion will also be the building of an NNS Scan, which you can picture like an NNS version of EtherScan. We will also create a new and more complete website, where end-users and developers will be able to access a full documentation so that they can find new ways to integrate the NNS in their projects.\n\nThe NNS Squad will also have access to an experimental Treasury which will be used to reward active members and finance new missions.\n\nFinally, and what we believe is the most exciting part of this Phase, we will launch the Nounish Club project to push proliferation through an experimental form of community reward and participation.\n\nAt the end of these developments, we will start the first experiments and collaborations for Phase 3.\n\nThe Nounish Club\nThe Nounish Club is an experiment made to reward nouners, nounish projects and communities outside the Nouniverse through new forms of community participation.\n\nThe idea is to allocate to this initiative all the numbers from 0 to 9999.‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®, making them a new coveted asset to stimulate NNS proliferation and inspire new community ideas.\n\nHowever, these numbers won't be available to be bought from the NNS.\n\nThey will only be earnable by taking active part in .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® proliferation and in special initiatives, and they will be entirely distributed for free through what we like to call a ‚ÄúProof of Proliferation‚Äù process.\n\nThe Nounish Club will be an exclusive group inside the NNS, completely in the hands of the Nouniverse.\n\nEvery nounish project will be able to add a special benefit to the club, such as discounts, NFTs, voting power, early accesses and more. They will also be able to ask the NNS to get a specific allocation of numbers to be shared among their communities or to be used as assets to keep in their treasury.\n\nThe more benefits will be added, the more the access to the Nounish Club will be valued.\n\nHere are some key points of how this would work:\n\nThe NNS will allocate an initial amount of numbers to the NNS Squad DAO created through Nouns Builder. This will add an additional asset to the treasury that will be managed according to DAO voting.\nFor the first 6 months, the numbers from 0 to 669 will be reserved for Nouners. Every existing nouner, as well as new ones, can request their specific numbers offering their help to proliferate the Nouns Name Service or to add benefits to make the Nounish Club more valuable.\nSpecific numbers would be used to invite new strategic users into the Nouns ecosystem.\nNounish DAOs and projects would be able to request a certain allocation of numbers for proliferation initiatives. This will make the distribution of the Nounish Club more and more decentralized.\nIf the experimental allocation to the NNS Squad DAO is successful, the NNS will gradually allocate a bigger amount of numbers to the DAO over time.\nThe Nounish Club benefits will be grouped on a url like nounishclub.wtf and new proposals about ideas, benefits and allocations can be managed through the NNS Squad DAO and discussed on the NNS Discord.\n\nThe Nounish Club will also use Prophouse as another important tool to generate and reward new ideas.\n\nWhy the Nounish Club?\nWe are exploring what the NNS can become through a continuous loop of never-tried before experiments and feedback. The Nounish Club is one of them.\n\nThe reason we are excited about the Nounish Club is that we believe it can be an interesting experiment which, if successful, will be able to create a massive value for every community in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nThis value can be seen as:\n\nBuilding value: It will be a further incentive for nounish communities to build cool things for the NNS and the Nounish Club.\nProliferation value: It will generate a further proliferation of the .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® and can be used to onboard strategic users into the Nouns ecosystem.\nEconomic value: The more the NNS and the Nounish Club will grow, the more every name of the Club will be valuable (incentivizing more building around it).\nNNSproposal-artwork3.jpg\n\nPHASE 3: Protocol\nOnce the NNS is supported by the major platforms in the space and successfully completes all the other tasks, it will be ready to open the protocol to other communities.\n\nThis upgrade will allow other great projects to build their TLD on top of the Nouns Name Service.\n\nThis will strengthen the relationship between the Nouniverse and worldwide communities working together for the proliferation of the Nouns Name Service.\n\nDwelling on the developments of Phase 3 is not the focus of this proposal, which aims to focus on the Expansion and Phase 2. However, our ultimate mission is making Nouns the center of a naming revolution that will attract not only end users, but also companies and other big projects.\n\nSome aspects of Phase 3 are still being brainstormed and we can‚Äôt wait to share more details with the community when they‚Äôll be ready.\n\nFUNDS\nPersonal context for full transparency from Dom (@dotnouns)\nBesides the 2 ETH received from Prop House in April, all the NNS development was bootstrapped.\n\nAs a founder and a true believer in the NNS, since the end of May I decided to commit 90% of my time on the project, gradually reducing the personal clients I was following in my day job.\n\nIf this can seem a hazard to many, burning the bridges that could act as a way out allowed the project to be laser focused on execution and allowed the NNS to become what it is today.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is helping the NNS to build a starting fund that will push the development and the proliferation with the same laser focus that has characterized Phase 1.\n\nThe request in a nutshell\nWe are requesting 195 ETH to scale the NNS, fully complete Phase 2 and begin experiments for Phase 3 as well.\n\nFunds will be immediately converted in USDC to avoid volatility of any kind.\n\nHow the funds will be used\nThe funding from this proposal will serve to develop the following areas, which will be crucial for the long-term success:\n\n¬∑ Expand the team and hire top professionals for specific tasks or projects. In particular, main focus will be given to external integrations and community building.\n¬∑ Design a website that will offer more support to end users and developers. This will include an extensive tech documentation and FAQ section.\n¬∑ Create a DAO for the NNS Squad through Nouns Builder. The DAO treasury will be used to coordinate proliferation actions among members and to manage the allocation of numbers for the Nounish Club.\n¬∑ Create an NNS House on Prop House focused on building new products for the NNS ecosystem, the Nounish Club and developing new integrations with important partners.\n¬∑ Push proliferation in and outside the Nouns ecosystem through the Nounish Club.\n¬∑ Add a new .nouns TLD that will help overcome .‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® copy-paste problems on external apps, thus making its applications more flexible and effective.\n\nThoughts about the ",

      "content": "# Fund Trustless USDC Payments Contract\n\n## Summary\n\nIn order to pay builders directly with USDC, we have deployed a contract (`TokenBuyer`) which swaps ETH for USDC on behalf of the DAO.\n\nWe propose to fund `TokenBuyer` with 625 ETH in order to acquire a USDC buffer of $500K (there's a baked in volatility buffer; any extra ETH will be used for later proposals or can come back to the treasury).\n\nFuture proposals created from nouns.wtf will automatically \"top off\" TokenBuyer with additional ETH, minimizing the need for additional funding proposals.\n\n## Motivation\n\nMany proposals have costs in USD (or other fiat currencies) and would prefer to request USDC for the DAO instead of ETH.\n\nIt is not trivial to swap ETH to USDC at proposal execution time without being subjected to sandwich attacks and getting bad swap rates.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe tech pod developed [TokenBuyer](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer) - a suite of smart contracts that allow permissionless swapping of tokens.\n\nTokenBuyer will allow proposals to request payment amount in USDC.\n\nThe swapping of ETH to USDC happens asynchronously, meaning:\nIf the DAO doesn't have enough USDC on hand, it will register a debt for the remaining amount. As soon as the rest of the USDC is available, it is sent to the recipient's wallet, no user intervention needed. We expect this to take a few days at most, depending on the total amount.\n\nTokenBuyer allows anyone to swap USDC for the ETH it holds. It uses Chainlink's ETH/USD price feed to set the price.\n\nWhenever a proposal requests USDC from the DAO, it will also include a transaction to top up TokenBuyer with additional ETH, proportional to the USDC amount requested.\n\n(*This \"automatic top-off\" is part of nouns.wtf; other governance clients can choose whether they implement this behavior*)\n\n### Example:\n* Builder A creates a proposal that requests 100,000 USDC\n* 2 actions will be added to the proposal:\n    1. Send 100K USDC from the TokenBuyer to Builder A\n    2. Send $150K worth of ETH to TokenBuyer to swap for USDC\n       * The extra $50K (50% buffer) is added in case ETH price goes down\n       * If TokenBuyer already holds ETH, then it will be sent less ETH accordingly\n* When the proposal executes:\n    1. 100K USDC it sent to Builder A\n        * If TokenBuyer has less than 100K USDC on hand, a debt will be registered towards Builder A\n    3. TokenBuyer will swap ETH for 100K USDC\n    4. Any remaining USDC debt to Builder A is paid as soon as it is swapped\n\n### UI preview\n\nThis is a preview of a new proposal creation flow for nouns.wtf developed by Brian.\nIt will go live once it's possible to request USDC.\n\n![proposal_ui_1](https://i.imgur.com/cOqFO3V.png)\n![proposal_ui_2](https://i.imgur.com/vZNqCJ7.png)\n\n### Parameters\n\n* `baselinePaymentTokenAmount`: amount of USDC to hold \"on hand\". Currently set to $500,000.\n* `botDiscountBPs`: a price discount to incentivize anyone (probably bots) to swap USDC for ETH. Currently set to 10 bps (0.1%).\n\n### Admin access\n* The tech pod & the DAO have an \"operator\" privilege with permissions to:\n    * Modify `baselinePaymentTokenAmount`, allowed range is: 0 - $1M\n    * Modify `botDiscountBPs`, allowed range is: 0-150 (0-1.5%)\n    * Pause TokenBuyer swaps\n    * Withdraw ETH from TokenBuyer and send it to the DAO\n    * Change the operator\n* Only the DAO has the ability to:\n    * Send USDC\n    * Change the allowed ranges for `baselinePaymentTokenAmount` and `botDiscountBPs`\n\n### Arbitrage bot\n* A reference bot has been developed and [open-sourced](https://github.com/solimander/eth-buyer-arbitrage-bot) by solimander. We encourage anyone to run their own bot or improve on the code\n* The tech pod will be running the reference bot at the beginning to bootstrap the system\n* Anyone can perform swaps against TokenBuyer. If we see low activity, we will increase the `botDiscountBPs` parameters to increase the incentive (e.g. if gas prices become high).\n\n## Auditing and Testing\n\n* The smart contracts were audited by yAcademy. [Audit report](https://github.com/nounsDAO/token-buyer/blob/166ec30ecd5dada8e17b55317ce3823d4c36b35f/audit/yAcademy_NounsDAO_TokenBuyer_review.pdf)\n    * No \"critical\" issues were found\n    * 1 \"high\" and 1 \"medium\" issues were found. The \"high\" issue was fixed, and the \"medium\" issue was acknowledged as not being an issue for us.\n* Prior to this proposal a few rounds of funding and spending using Token Buyer were done on mainnet\n\n\n## Funding\n* Assuming `baselinePaymentTokenAmount` is set to $500K, we would want to fund TokenBuyer with enough ETH to swap for $500K. We suggested adding an extra 50% to account for price changes. At current ETH prices this 750,000 / 1200 = 625 ETH\n* The initial ETH amount will be sent to the tech pod multisig\n* The tech pod will deploy it into TokenBuyer in chunks while monitoring that it performs correctly\n\n---\n\nIncluded Transactions:\n\n* Send 625 ETH to: `0x79095391743e0f017A16c388De6a6a3f175a5cD5` (Tech Pod Multisig)",

      "content": "# DCS Pod\n\n## tl;dr ##\nDCS is a pod that focuses on bridging the gap between existing off-chain funding options and larger on-chain props. Focused primarily on the sectors of software, arts and IRL with a funding range between 8-25Œû, our goal is to help builders with a track record scale up within the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n## Overview ##\n\nThere currently exists a large gap within the current Nouns funding landscape that creates challenges for Nounish builders in the ecosystem. \n\nOn the lower end of the spectrum, there are many options for builders to seek funding for <10Œû, between NSFW, Prop House, and a number of subDAO efforts (Gnars, SharkDAO, Lil Nouns, etc). On the higher end, there is virtually no limit as we have seen on-chain props go to $1M and beyond.\n\nHowever, in between these two points there is a gap that continues to grow as we see NSFW, Prop House, and subDAOs prefering to run more experiments with smaller amounts, all the while prominent Nouners are increasingly calling for the DAO to scale upward and not consider on-chain props lower than 20Œû.\n\nThis places builders in a tough spot where they must figure out how to take their concept from point A to point B to achieve escape velocity. This issue is further exacerbated by the closure of the official Nouns Discord server, which will make it harder for the DAO to reach consensus on on-chain props as a governing body.\n\nDCS will focus on working with these builders who have \"graduated\" from one of the off-chain funding programs and provide them with bridge funding and guidance as they work towards the goal of passing a larger scale on-chain prop with the broader DAO base.\n\nSaid a different way, we help builders **Do Cool Sh*t**.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pMkWTM2.png)\n\n## Pod Details ##\n\nDCS pod members will leverage their Nounish network and experience to guide and work with builders to ensure their further success in the DAO. DCS will act as a working group to ensure our funded builders are provided more than just capital but an active group to collaborate with and build alongside.\n\n**The pod plays a key role in four ways:**\n\n- Creates a stepping stone for off-chain \"graduates\" on their journey to larger on-chain props, both in terms of financial support and guidance in refining their project\n- Provides accountability and additional data points for the broader DAO to consider when the resulting props go on-chain\n- Emphasizes a transparent decision making framework that is data-driven and scalable\n- Actively works with builders to ensure their further success in the DAO by being a source of active support and guidance helping them move through the roadblocks and challenges they face\n\n**What areas will the pod focus on?**\n\nDCS will focus on key areas where we feel we can provide the most value and help ideas scale quickly. Given the subject matter expertise and experience of pod members, the following areas are our initial focus: \n\n- **Software** - dApps, smart contracts, mobile apps, gaming\n- **Arts & Content** - artists, musicians, video and content creators\n- **IRL** - local/regional activations, events, and other on-the-ground efforts\n\n\n**How will the group operate?**\n\n- Props (sourced from off-chain funding programs) will be be submitted to the pod online\n- Prop will be discussed on weekly DCS calls\n- Prop will be voted on in the DCS Discord\n\nWe will work with the operators of the various off-chain funding program to raise visibility for DCS as a \"next step\" for graduates. We will use Prop House and/or [AddressBoard](https://www.addressform.io/) to receive formal funding requests, so we can ensure proper data collection throughout the process for the DAO.\n\nThe pod will convene once a week on an open call to discuss what has been submitted since the last meeting and to discuss additional pipeline developments. These calls will be available to the community. This will foster discussion about props, help engage with builders and elevate the quality of props that get funded. Emphasis will be placed on data-driven processes to ensure greater builder accountability and proper measurement of ROI back to the DAO.\n\nAfter discussion, pod members will decide which props will be funded by voting on a dedicated Discord channel (or via Prop House platform).\n\nPod members are required to attend weekly meetings and actively give feedback on props. Pod members can be removed and replaced based on participation (which will be decided by the remaining members of the pod). Pod members will be rotated every 3-6 months in order to spread knowledge, boost decentralization and to ensure the pod is not overly reliant on any single member. A maximum of 2 pod members will be substituted at a time, not to create disruption in the work flow. One pod member will be elected secretary by the pod, and this person will take care of administrative tasks including providing a summary of the meeting in writing, which will be available to the public through the DCS discord.\n\nThe committee‚Äôs gnosis safe will require 3 of 5 members to sign.\n\nBudget: 126Œû\nBreakdown:\n* Props: 75Œû\n* Admin: 51Œû\n    * Target prop funding: ranging from ~9x8Œû - 3x25Œû projects\n    * 5 pod members\n        * Core member: 3Œû per month\n        * Secretary: add'l 2Œû per month\n\nFor context, this is 0,4% of our treasury. We are aiming to propose a low-risk/high-reward pod.\n\n## Pod Members ##\n\n1. **[B](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/beautyandthepunk.eth), yours truly.** \n\n    **Twitter:** @beautyandpunk \n    **Discord:** thebeautyandthepunk#8285\n    **Specialty Areas:** Art, esports, sports, extreme sports, onboarding, science, underrepresented communities\n    \n    **Props/Nounish Highlights:**\n\n    **Nouns**\n    Prop 41: Nouns 3D-printed fashion collection by DANIT: milestones 3+4\n    Prop 82: Sell Noun #253 to Lil Nouns DAO\n    Prop 95: Nouns @ Art Basel (Basel, Switzerland)\n    Prop 98: NOUNS IN RIO - Nouns to be a part of the 1st Brazilian international NFT exhibition\n    Prop 118: NounsDAO Brazil\n    Prop 119: Nouns Esports Pod\n\n    **Lil Nouns**\n    Prop 30: Lil Sisters Fund\n    2 rounds of 5 x 1ETH props through Lil Sisters.\n\n    **Prop House**\n    100 Nounish hoodies for homeless people\n    20 Twitter covers for 20 nouns projects\n    Nouns OS as an entire Operating System Nouns-Themed for All Things Nouns\n    Nounified Skate Park @ RIO\n    Nounifying Brazil and Web3 Workshops in communities of Rio de Janeiro\n    Lil Noun sponsorship to AWEN 7-a-side women's soccer team\n    Rap Battle by Nouns\n    Nouns School Web3 Platform\n    Nouns Waves - Sunny Pires Sponsorship\n    Valorant Brazilian Women's Team\n    Brazilian influencer soy_taki\n    FestiNouns Awen 2022\n    Nounish Coloring Booklet for Children\n    Finance children in need at TPM, a Brazilian NGO from Nuala Costa, an LGBTQIAP+ black surfer\n\n2. **[Oni](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/apenoun.eth)** \n\n    **Twitter:** @apenoun\n    **Discord:** Oni#1111\n    **Specialty Areas:** Gaming, tech, art, fashion, design, charity, governance\n    \n    **Props/Nounish Highlights:**\n    Prop 40: Nouns Skate Decks for kids in need\n    Prop 53: Calladita Film Funding\n    Prop 97: Nouns Baked Beans\n    Prop 119: Nouns Esports Pod Member\n    Prop 132: Nouns x Dopamine Merch\n\n    **IRL Activations:**\n    Nouns @ Annual Coin Center Dinner\n    Nouns x TSP NFT NYC Go Skateboarding Day event\n    Nouns x TSP Long Beach Skateboard Giveaway \n\n3. **[EOJ](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/thepencil.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8), Noun 354 & 227, former Growth at Ledger.**\n\n    **Twitter:** @EojJim \n    **Discord:** Eoj#7391\n    **Specialty Areas:** Art, Crypto, {DeFi/NFT}  Fashion, Investing\n\n    **Props/Nounish Highlights:**\n    -Prop 126: Nouns x John Hamon \n    -Prop due diligence with builders to hash out and iterate on prop ideas such as Prop 116: Comic Book Release and Prop 135: Xanadu\n    -Working with NFT Paris organizers to assemble a nounish activation in 2023 (discovery phase)\n    -Active contributor in Nouner weekly calls \n\n\n4. **[Sam Ellis](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/thepencil.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)** \n\n    **Twitter:** @manofmissle, \n    **Discord:** samellis ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®#4764\n    **Specialty Areas:** Gaming, art and design, animation, comics, conventions/irl events, charity, onboarding\n    \n    **Props/Nounish Highlights:**\n    Participated in the first days of testing nouns on Rinkeby\n    Active Nouncil member that regularly participates in voting\n    Active participant and on the organizing committee for The Noun Square\n    Participant in the funded Prop 70 (CC0 Pitchbook)\n    Co-developed Composables    \n    Co-developed YOLO Nouns\n    Co-developed Nouns Auction Tracker\n    Co-developed Nounish Labs & 1/2 owner of Noun 455\n    Introduced Samsung to Nouns which lead to their video in Times Square and 837X DCL experience.\n    \n5. **[Juan](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/juanx.eth)** \n\n    **Twitter:** @juanhernanx \n    **Discord:** Juan ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®#2492\n    **Specialty Areas:** Software, dApps, smart contracts, mobile apps, business, finance\n\n    **Props/Nounish Highlights:**\n    Nounish Labs: Owner of Noun 455\n    Co-developed Composables\n    Co-developed YOLO Nouns\n    Co-developed Nouns Auction Tracker\n    Prop House: Crowdsourcing Ideas round winner\n    Prop House Challenge: Composables\n    Prop House: Nounish Hackathon\n    Active Nouncil member    \n    \n\n\n---\n\n\nIf at the end of the 3-month period not enough good props were found and funded, the funds will be returned to the Nouns DAO treasury.

This change has been reviewed thoroughly by technical DAO members (solimander & vapeape).\n\n## Proposal Transactions for Humans\n\n* `_setImplementation`: upgrades DAO logic to V2.1.\n\nFor any questions, we're available on the #54-tech-grants channel on the nounish discord\n\nverbs team ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®",

      "content": "# Nouns x MrBeast\n\nA proposal drafted by [**Hindsight**](https://twitter.com/0Hindsight) (ProNouns: NFT/OG) with the support of [**Jarmen**](https://twitter.com/jarmen43) (a man struggling to tell his wife he is a zebra on the internet) and [**Sam Ellis**](https://twitter.com/manofmissle) (Chief Meme Officer)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Dz7SOwt.jpg)\n\n&nbsp;\n## **HOW TO VOTE ON THIS PROPOSAL**\n\n* **Vote Yes:** If you think it would be good value for DAO to pay 500 Eth to have a Nounish focused episode on the most watched show on the internet - with a money back guarantee if it doesn‚Äôt happen.¬†\n* **Vote No:** If you don‚Äôt think that would be good value.\n* **Abstain:** If you gift people toasters for their wedding.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **THE CHALLENGE**\nThis proposal requests that the DAO fund a project for **500 eth** in order to proliferate the Nouns by running **a competition, open to anyone, to** **convince** [**Mr. Beast**](https://www.youtube.com/user/mrbeast6000) **to give away $500k (340 Eth)**, preferably to charity, on his YouTube channel, given to him by the Nouns in a Nounish focused episode of his show.\n\n**The person or people that convince Mr. Beast to do this will be rewarded with a $250k prize.**\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **THE REWARD**\nThe $250k Reward will be awarded to the person or people that Mr. Beast credits with convincing him to accept the challenge on the following terms:\n\n*   $175k if he accepts the request and does the show.\n*   An additional $75k if he gives the majority (>50%) of the $500k to charity. (This can be the same person and message or different people and messages)\n*   The episode must be on Mr. Beasts main YouTube channel.\n*   The Nouns must be featured on the show for any of the funds to be paid out.\n\nSo it might be a good idea for people to submit ideas to Mr. Beast that inspires him to meet these criteria.¬†\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **TOTAL COST**\nIf this proposal passes but no one can convince Mr. Beast to take on and complete the project within the next 9 months ‚Äì all the Eth will be returned to the Treasury. **Total Cost of 0 Eth.**\n\nIf this proposal passes and someone is successful in convincing Mr. Beast to feature the Nouns in the most watched show on the internet while hopefully giving a lot of money away to good causes it will have a **Total Cost of 500 Eth.**\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **WHY MR. BEAST?**\nHe is the most watched person on the internet (with over 100m subscribers and up to 300m views on his videos), so I think Nouns featuring on his show would bring awareness to Nouns, NFTs, DAOs and Ethereum to millions. In doing so, it will allow people to see the great creative initiatives that Nouns are working on and have funded (e.g.[73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73))¬† as well as charities it has supported (e.g. [104](https://nouns.wtf/vote/104) ,[42](https://nouns.wtf/vote/42) ). On top of this I would hope it will showcase the ability of a decentralised network of people to raise funds and successfully deploy those funds in innovative ways that leverages its community to make big things happen!\n\nMr. Beast already has a good awareness of crypto and he has a history of giving to charity at a large scale too so hopefully he will be able to bring awareness to all of this in a thoughtful, considered, and fun way.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **A $250k REWARD ‚Ä¶ THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY!?**\nI can imagine some Nouners balking at the $250k prize being paid to whoever can convince Mr. Beast to take on this challenge, which is understandable.\n\nMy goal is to create value for the DAO and while one could argue that people will take on this challenge for a smaller amount ‚Äì we just don‚Äôt know if it would be _as_ effective and ultimately it will always be a guess as to what the _right_ figure is.\n\nThe goal is to mobilise 99.9% of the internet and get them interested in making this happen through the incentive of a big reward. And while no one can be certain of the exact figure that would be most effective, what I _do_ know is that $250k has a high chance of success. It will advertise itself by getting people talking about it and it will massively increase the chances of the challenge being accepted. I believe we would rather potentially pay more to increase the chances of success.\n\nWhile it is a lot of money, I think it presents extremely good value. Price is what you pay and value is what you get. If no one can make it happen, nothing gets paid out and the price is zero. But if someone does make it happen, a $750k price to have the Nouns featured on the most watched show on the internet will provide great value.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## **WHAT DO I GET FROM THIS?**\nNothing\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Terms and Conditions**\n*   Transfer will be made to the prize winner after the video has aired on YouTube.\n*   Mr. Beast cannot refer himself as the person to win the prize.\n*   If Mr. Beast decides to do the show but does not (or can not) identify the person or message that convinced him to take it on - the $250k will be put into a prop house round where $50k will be awarded to 5 charities as voted on by Nouners.\n*   The $500k (340 Eth) will be transferred from the multisig to Mr. Beast upon written agreement between the parties.\n*   For the interest of transparency and to avoid conflicts of interest: I am not Mr. Beast nor do I have any affiliation with him in any way. If (somehow) it is me or this proposal that convinces him to do the challenge or to do it for charity, I will pledge the prize fund to charity and no Nounder will be eligible to win this prize.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n**Funds**\nIf the proposal passes, Eth to the equivalent of $750k will be converted to USDC to fund the challenge and any excess will be returned to the treasury.¬†\n\nThe funds will remain in the multisig until either the challenge is accepted or converted back to Eth and returned to the treasury after 9 months if the challenge is not accepted.\n\nThe funds will be held in a 2 / 3 Multisig with the signatures being:\n\n*   Hindsight - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0Hindsight) - [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/0xhindsight.eth)\n*   Jarmen - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jarmen43)\n*   Sam Ellis - [Twitter](https://twitter.com/manofmissle) - [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/thepencil.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)",

      "content": "# Nouns Builder Protocol\n\n# Nouns Builder Protocol\n### Public Infrastructure brought to you by Zora and NounsDAO\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JycpSjR.png)\n\n**Mainnet Launch:** November 1st\n**Expected DAO Launch:** November 15th\n**Website:** [nouns.build](https://nouns.build)\n**Twitter:** [@nounsbuilder](http://twitter.com/nounsbuilder)\n\nLike you, we believe that Nouns DAO is a significant form factor innovation for NFTs and DAOs. Instead of giving all power and capital solely to a project‚Äôs founders, the Nouns model enables communities to emerge progressively, and to be active participants in how their brand and community evolves.\n\nWe believe that more Nouns forks should exist - so we‚Äôre building a tool anyone can use to build them.\n\nFor the past couple of months we have been working on the Nouns Builder: a product that makes it easy for anyone to create their own Nouns DAO with any art, any auction cadence and flexible DAOs that can evolve over time.\n\nAs we‚Äôve been building this tool, we‚Äôve increasingly realized that it makes sense to use this very tool to create a DAO that will govern, sustain and develop the Nouns Builder project itself. By doing so, Nouns builder can:\n* Demonstrate the utility of Nouns Builder as a public good\n* Utilize the ecosystem of tools in Nouns: Prop House, Agora\n* Experiment using the NounsDAO model as an alternative to the subDAO multisig\n* Experiment using the NounsDAO model to proliferate a protocol and products\n* Expand use of the NounsDAO model as a more effective governance model for collective decision making\n* Share governance of this DAO with Nouns, Zora, and future contributors as interested in expanding the horizon of this public infrastructure as we are. \n\nWe are going to call this DAO ‚ÄúBuilder‚Äù, with its own art and NFT that will be minted each day. Builder will be NounsDAO from day 1, with the goal of proliferating this infrastructure.\n\n**Core details to note:**\n\n* Based on extensive feedback from the Nouns community, the protocol is entirely free. There is currently no protocol wide fee.\n* DAOs can opt in to gift a certain amount of their NFTs to Nouns or any other DAO or platform\n* In prior versions of the proposal, we proposed that NounsDAO would be the deployer of the Builder DAO. Based on feedback from the community we have removed this aspect of the proposal.\n* The protocol development has been extensive, with careful consideration made to\n    * Enable DAOs to easily upgrade and evolve themselves over time in a safe manner\n    * Be gas efficient\n    * Open up room for exploration around new distribution types like VRGDAs\n* The protocol has been audited via Code4rena, with Zora paying $129K USDC ($90k in prizes) to complete it.\n* We have built an easy to use tool at [nouns.build](https://nouns.build) where over 60 testnet DAOs have been created in the process of testing and refining the user experience.\n\n**Ask:**\n\n1000 ETH contribution to seed the Nouns Builder DAO treasury to help this public good reach its full potential. \n\n\n**Completed Work:**\n\nRather than requesting retroactive reward for development, ***we are asking NounsDAO to pay it forward* by seeding the Builder treasury with ETH** for funding the development of the Nouns Builder protocol as a public good and expansion of the ecosystem by the community. \n\nZora contributed ~4 months of development time on creating the Nouns Builder protocol\n* Full time contributions from the Zora solidity, backend, and front end engineering teams\n* Full time design and creative direction for Nouns Builder artworks.\n* ~100 ETH spent on the Code4rena audit.\n\nThis contribution to the Nouns Builder DAO treasury means there is sufficient Day 1 capital to immediately conduct prop house mandates and funding rounds for the development, proliferation, and accessibility of the protocol and ecosystem for the benefit of the public.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n* Audited Nouns Builder smart contracts.\n* Custom Nouns Builder generative artwork (CC0).\n* Builder DAO for anyone in the community to join and contribute.\n\n**All of the ETH will be going to the Nouns Builder DAO treasury.**\n\n**Builder DAO:**\n\nThe Builder DAO is created using the Nouns Builder tool and protocol. It is the entity onchain that will be responsible for funding the proliferation of the ecosystem and development of the protocol over time. \n\nWe believe Nouns Builder represents critical public infrastructure for community decision making, and we want to use the full power of the NounsDAO model to further this protocol and ecosystem of different apps built on top of it, as well as being able to natively tap into tools in the ecosystem like Prop House and Agora.\n\nBuilderDAO creators will receive the following governance rights in the Builder DAO for a period of 5 years after Builder DAO‚Äôs launch to allow the creators to support of the growth and development of this public good while in its nascency:\n* 1/10 to zora.eth\n* 1/20 to nouns.eth\n\nFor clarity, DAO members shall not receive any revenues from Builder DAO daily auctions. All funds in the Treasury shall be dedicated to improving the Builder DAO protocol and its public good function, and growing the community, brand, and ecosystem. \n\nThe Builder DAO will start with a daily auction. The NFTs that will be minted each day are a nounish artwork that expands on the ideas of ‚ÄúInternet flags‚Äù, a collection of unicode symbols that communities can organize around, with the nounish colors at its core, as well as the noggles.\n\nHere is a sample of the codex below:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kArgmJn.png)\n\n\n**NounsDAOs for Public Infrastructure:**\n\nWe believe it is important to experiment with Nouns forks as a way to further particular pieces of infrastructure within the nounish ecosystem. Instead of funded LLCs and companies to ultimately manage tools like Nouns Builder and things like Prop House, we want to actively explore using a Nounish DAO as the primary entity to further a public protocol and an ecosystem of many platforms built on top of it. \n\nThis is why we are leading from the front with the Builder DAO. We are also optimistic that this can become a blueprint for any team that is developing protocols‚Äîlike Zora itself. \n\n**Sustainability:**\n\nIn prior proposals there have been open questions around the future models for sustainability without need for persistent funding from NounsDAO all the time. We believe that this is the first meaningful step in this direction, and we hope to set a precedent and blueprint for future teams to build sustainable Public Infrastructure that is native to the Nouns ecosystem and DAO itself.\n\n**Transaction Details:**\n\n1000 ETH transferred to an escrow smart contract that will hold the funds until the Builder DAO is live and operational. We are expecting this to be live on approximately November 15th.\n\n**References:**\n[Discourse post](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-builder-draft/2007)\n[Prop house](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/prop-house-protocol-public-infrastructure-by-nouns-dao/1594)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yPwwE6T.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M31ZnVx.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GLLYhTu.jpg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "# NounsOTG x Stoopid Buddy x Rose Parade\n\n**What do 2 on-chain Props, 1 fifty-foot float made of flowers, and 6 life-sized Nouns have in common?**\n\n\n\nThey will all be in one place to ring in the New Year for the largest nounish proliferation event ever! [NounsOTG](https://nouns.wtf/vote/110) is partnering with the team at [Stoopid Buddy Studios](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73) for the [Rose Parade](https://tournamentofroses.com/) in Pasadena, CA after New Year's Day, to help Nouns reach an audience of over 38 Million individuals nationwide.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HOT1b1T.jpg)\n\n\nWhat will this collaboration look like? NounsOTG will be working directly with the team at Stoopid Buddy in person on the ground for 10 days during this event. The Stoopid Buddy team has covered all build and production costs for the float during this event in [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73). After multiple conversations discussing how this event could be further bolstered, Aubtoshi and NounsOTG have been asked to be a part of this event. NounsOTG plans on adding to the already-established effort that Prop 73 has put forth in the following ways:\n\n**10 Days of On The Ground Activations + Brand Ambassadors**\n\nAfter Christmas, all of the floats for the parade (which are being framed out and built off-site) are transported to their final location prior to the parade, which is where thousands of volunteers come to help decorate the floats with flowers. This time period will include full days of OTG (On The Ground) interviews, filming, activations with volunteers, activations with people who are waiting for the event to begin, and more. We will also be filming with the life-sized nounish ‚Äúwalk-arounds‚Äù (nouns costumes made by Stoopid Buddy, creators of costumes seen on the celebrity singing show ‚ÄúThe Masked Singer‚Äù) during this time. Post-event, the floats will be staged in a different holding area to be observed and photographed one last time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5jlT56O.jpg)\n*Nounish \"Walk-Arounds\" by SB*\n\n\nAdditionally, NounsOTG will scout and hire 10 trained brand ambassadors that will be active the day before the parade, during the parade and afterwards, and at the Rose Bowl when handing out the mini limited edition footballs. The responsibilities of these ambassadors will include being on-brand, walking (waving, jumping, dancing) in a 5-mile parade line. We have allowed for the cost of their food and beverages during specific meal times, transportation to and from the event from the staging area, additional hours on the day prior during the final prep; as well as team meetings, zoom calls and fittings prior to the event, as we plan to deck them out in Nouns Brand and other nounish swag.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sbu1t1L.png)\n\n**Special Guest DJ + Custom DJ Set On The Float + Over 18,000 Nounish Giveaways**\n\nThe DJ will be none other than **Richerd Intern**, and his crew will perform with a full/unique set during the live event! Although the parade float images are still not public or released, I can reveal that there will indeed be room for Richerd... \n\nHis team is London based and the cost comes directly from their team and includes their travel and accommodation. We couldn't be more nounish with the Noun266 (Chart Bars Noun head) if we tried!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JiJ5BwX.png)\n\nOver the course of 10 days, we will be handing out over 18,000 unique nounish items, including limited edition mini footballs and shirts, low-fi paper noggles, sticker packs and nouns temporary tattoos. Our goal is to get these items national television coverage during both the parade and rose bowl game. Noggles on the faces in the audience and children throwing nounish mini footballs would be a lasting image during this important holiday event. This opportunity has allowed OTG to connect to other nounish builders and we are open to further collaborations with Nouners and builders.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jp42GOh.jpg)\n\n\n**Immediate Impact**\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the Rose Parade or its impact, it is one of the major events of the year as the 5 mile parade ends with the start of the Rose Bowl football game. Outside of the 37 million viewers at home, the entire area of Southern California is focused on this event for several weeks prior!\n\nOver **1 Million people** will be in attendance on the day of the parade with a live broadcast to over 37 Million additional individuals nationwide. With a 5 mile parade line and an entire week of content creation and nounish item giveaways prior to the parade as the float is brought to completion, this will be one of the key proliferation event opportunities of the year for NounsDAO. Not to mention the day after the event sees 60-100k attendees that visit the floats to get a close up look at all the details - another amazing activation opportunity.   \n\n\n\n\n**Proposal Cost Breakdown**\n\nTotal ETH: 52, Total USDC: $78,000 *amount calculated with 1 ETH = $1,500 USD\n\n\n* 2.77 ETH: 250 Limited Edition Shirts (Nouns X Stoopid Buddy X Rose Parade)\n* 3.50 ETH: 5000 Stickers packs & 5000 Temporary Tattoos + Nounish MVPs for product placement\n* 5.65 ETH: Full custom DJ set by special guest DJ (includes Travel & Accommodation for their team)\n* 6.45 ETH: 10 Nouns Brand Ambassadors walking next to the parade and handing out items\n* 6.55 ETH: 250 Limited Edition Footballs (Nouns X Stoopid Buddy X Rose Parade)\n* 11.72 ETH: On-Site Coordination & Production Management: Aubtoshi & Emma & 2 PAs (10 days)\n* 14.84 ETH: Travel Costs & Accommodation & Staging Area for Items (10 days)\n* 0.00 ETH: 7000 Lo-fi Paper Noggles (Send purchase order to NSFW, no additional funding needed)\n* 0.52 ETH: Fees to cover for multi-sig transactions outlined below\n\nTo account for any ETH volatility during the time this prop goes through the voting process, we are adding an additional 10 ETH to this prop. After the initial conversion to USDC, any extra eth from this 10 ETH will be immediately sent back to the DAO. Additionally, any ETH left from the Travel Costs & Accommodation budget will also be sent back to the DAO.\n**Total ETH amount requested from NounsDAO: 62 ETH**\n\nAll funds will be held in a multi-sig wallet that will initiate the following transactions:\n* Convert ETH to $78,000 USDC ($780 for txn fees)\n* Send any remaining ETH back to the NounsDAO\n* $3,395 USDC: Sent to PA1 for on-site production assistance during 10 days\n* $3,395 USDC: Sent to PA2 for on-site production assistance during 10 days\n* $5,395 USDC: Sent to Aubtoshi for production coordination payment\n* $5,395 USDC: Sent to Emma for production coordination payment \n* $8,475 USDC: Sent to DJ + team upon confirmation of their booking and release forms collected\n* $9,405 USDC: Sent to OTG to order Stickers, Temporary Tattoos and Shirts\n* $9,675 USDC: Sent to OTG to have payment ready for OTG Brand Ambassadors\n* $9,825 USDC: Sent to VSVSVS to order limited edition footballs\n* $22,260 USDC: Sent to OTG to book travel/accommodation/food/additional costs\n\n**The multisig (2/3) signers are:** \n\n[**Aubtoshi**](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/aubtoshi.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8)\n[**Toady Hawk**](https://nounsagora.com/delegate/toadyhawk.%E2%8C%90%E2%97%A8-%E2%97%A8) \n**Nounder 9999**\n\n\n**Long-Term Value**\n\nStoopid Buddy has been actively engaged in the community and are clearly delivering on their prop. Outside of creating a successful experience at the event itself, footage from the event will be used in the documentary outlined in [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73). I have been to the studio in Burbank, I have met the walk-around craftsman and have been trusted by the Stoopid Buddy team to see confidential alpha from their News Years Event and participate in production conversations leading up to it. \n\nThis additional push to create a nounish experience and vibe during the event will connect Nouns directly with all the many people in attendance, plus brand new audiences at home. **While the SB crew are focused on long form video for their documentary, this proposal will allow me and my team to supplement that content with visceral and viral short-form content perfect for social media. All our content will of course be made CC0 and available for future use, ensuring that the DAO's investment in this event is documented and that our brand is seen and experienced by an even broader audience than those reached by the documentary and broadcasts alone.** \n\nProp 73 will go down as one of the most successful funded proposals to date for NounsDAO, not only for its reach and high quality production, but for real nounish interaction with so many real people. I feel honored to have been asked by SB to help with the on-site activation piece for the Rose Bowl Parade, to ensure that our Nouns national television coverage has the best visuals possible with lasting effects. I look forward to the opportunity to bring this NounsOTG activation to life!\n",

We have collaborated with many high caliber clients in and out of web3 such as:\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/7kdbuvP.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/586628568)\n\n\n[Compound](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129713109/Compound-III) - Compound III is a collateralised borrowing protocol that optimizes capital efficiency, gas costs, and security.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/ugBEZmu.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/715516917)\n\n[STL](https://www.behance.net/gallery/146273121/Smart-Token-Labs-TokenScript) - A revolutionary new Web3 technology designed to take Token Gating to the next level.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/mjRPzlF.png)](https://vimeo.com/553216699)\n\n\n[Coinbase](https://www.behance.net/gallery/131256363/Coinbase) - Coinbase is the easiest place to buy and sell cryptocurrency, via a trusted and easy-to-use platform for accessing the broader crypto economy.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/yeJCvDP.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/575631888)\n\n[Adobe Splash Screen](https://www.behance.net/gallery/129640141/Adobe-After-Effects) - Each year, Adobe commissions artists from a variety of disciplines and styles to show off the power of Creative Cloud by producing custom artwork to represent each product.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/auygyYd.png)\n\nWe at NeverSitStill encourage creative thinking  and personal development amongst the company,  which lead to a conversation about Nouns with motion designer [James Vallance (MrSEAKs)](https://twitter.com/SeaksMr). His collaboration earlier this year with Gnars DAO, and his work with Gami (Noun 189), to create an animated piece for NFT NYC proliferating Nouns.¬†A major component of Nouns' participation in NFT NYC.\n\nSee more here: [Full video](https://create.zora.co/collections/0xdcbca59d38eb3abfcb5055fe7bd7f5ce027d03c3) | [Artist BTS & NY billboard footage](https://twitter.com/SeaksMr/status/1553862678795661312)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8ja4qFe.png)\n\n## Proposal\n\n### What will we make for you?\n\nA 30-60 second, crafted hype video that represents Nouns in an exciting way. Exploring Nounish themes through visual metaphor, celebrating the culture with existing users, and onboarding the new.\n\nThink of it as an above-the-funnel video encapsulating the key themes of Nouns in a punchy, artistic, and fresh video to make people go WTF is Nouns?\n\nThe look and tone of the piece will be designed to capture attention, potentially becoming an ownable style for future Nouns advertising and messaging material. \n\nIt's a catalyst video to start the gravitational pull that is Nouns.\n\n### What is the video going to be about?\n\nThe video will represent strong themes that Nouns focuses on through visual metaphor:\n\n- Use case of NFTs for raising funds for positive change\n- Evolution and growth of Nouns\n- DAOs/community\n- Bootstrapping/launchpad\n- Interaction of Nouns and IRL, bringing the power of crypto to IRL\n\nWith these ideas at the core, we spin them into a powerful narrative that follows the birth of the Noggles and its exponential growth to become an object of power, one for positive change in the world.\n\nTo represent the multi-faceted nature of the Nouniverse, we intend to use a mixed-media approach, with input from various artists within our team. Distinct flavours coming together to create one visual style in a seamless video.\n\nWe feel this approach also carries the spirit of the Nouns DAO. A diverse pool of people building something great together.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/A0oZVgy.jpg)\n\n### The Nouniverse & Big Bang\n\nIn the beginning, at the centre of it all is the Noggle. The Noggle atom, molecule, cell, animal, vegetable, mineral. We want to place the Noggle at the centre of this big bang and follow the narrative of it's growing impact on the universe.\n\nThis rippling wave will take effect on the world around it, transforming and creating. What does the world look like through a Nounish lens?\n\n### Why hype video?\n\nThe current state of our fast-paced digital world needs information to be condensed into a highly digestible format to relay anything valuable.\n\n[Prop 143](https://nouns.wtf/vote/143) spoke to the fantastic concept of the video marketing funnel. To borrow a term from the Nounish team, we want to talk to the top of the funnel and go even more front-facing, above the funnel. This is why it‚Äôs important to create a first point of contact with broader audiences that inspires them to care about what they‚Äôre seeing. We want to ignite a spark within viewers to seek out and learn more about Nouns of their own volition.\n\nA hype video executes this perfectly. A short, visually rich video, presented in an artistic, eye-catching way, that grabs people's attention and hooks them in, down the Nouns rabbit hole.\n\n### Do traditional hype videos work in web3?\n\nIt‚Äôs well known that video is a perfect medium to promote and create awareness of a brand/product. Hype videos are a tool used by luxury brands within web2 and we want to bring these tried and tested methods to web3 and Nouns.\n\nTake the promo video for [Doodles v2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv9TaQ5z9jw), or the [Otherside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt1equGhkQE) Yuga Labs video. These are both great examples of highly crafted, short animated hype videos to blow up awareness of a brand/product to funnel new audiences into web3 and their brand.\n\nThese videos aren't about explaining how, but what and why.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/IbzEFzH.gif)\n\n### Video Lifespan\n\nA hype video has a long shelf life and is easy to re-use. Whenever you need promotional content, take an already existing hype video and place it at the front of marketing to interest viewers.\n\nCombine the re-usability of a hype video with assets that are CC0 and you have a piece of art that can be re-used, re-jigged, and a video that can live on for a long time.\n\nRender characters, assets, scenes, and the entire video as CC0 for all to share and spread Nouns proliferation.\n\n### Meta\n\nAir-drop current Noun owners their very own piece of this hype video in the form of NFTs created from scenes of the entire piece. This will create a collection of different NFTs from the entire video.\n\nOwners could even trade/swap/collect these separate NFTs to piece together the sequence and receive a rare airdrop of the entire video minted as an NFT. This is a way to celebrate the creation of the work, and reward holders who were already a part of the ecosystem when it happened.\n\nPOAPs for voters. Incentive to vote, a reward for being involved in bringing this project of Nouns proliferation to life.\n\n## Process\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pjCL5wT.png)\n\n### Process\n\nWe use a traditional linear pipeline for development, from concept through to mastering. This stepped approach allows us to spend an appropriate amount of time in each phase, delivering top notch work in an efficient timeline. At each major milestone, our clients give condensed feedback to ensure that the work is communicating its message clearly.\n\nTo ensure the work is original and ownable, we use a period of time for high level research and development. This means we aren't aiming to re-create a reference, but build something new and ownable for the Nouns DAO.\n\n### Pre production\n\n- R&D (Community liaisons to guide content)\n- Concept art, thumbnails\n- Design, visual language development\n- Storyboarding\n- Animatic\n\n### Production\n\n- Animation\n- Music development\n- NFT + POAP creation\n\n### Post-Production\n\n- Compositing, Grading\n- Sound design\n- Mastering\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Brand hype video (Widescreen 16:9, 4K, 30fps) [archival master + web ready]\n- Working files\n- NFT ready exports (TBD with community)\n- POAP artwork (TBD with community)\n\n### Production Schedule\n\nPre production to begin before EOY if approved.\n\nFull production starting no later than January 8th, taking approximately 10-12 weeks to complete the final piece.\n\n### Communications\n\nRegular updates and WIP process interaction with the Nouns community is important. We want to build in public and share progress openly. Our team is comfortable with Discord and presentation, major milestones will be submitted for the community to feedback as well as enjoy the process.\n\n**Contact**\n\n**Gami**  *Noun 189*\n**Discord** 0xigami#0001\n**Twitter** [0xigami](https://twitter.com/0xigami)\n\n**James Vallance**  *NSS Motion Designer, MrSEAKs*\n**Discord** MrSeaks#0944\n**Twitter** [seaksmr](https://twitter.com/seaksmr)\n\n**John Grist**  *NSS Creative Lead*\n**Discord** brunch#5470\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HIqJvZt.gif)\n\n## Cost\n\n### Pricing\n\n- Approx 2.5 months production time\n- Project Management\n- Visual Development\n- Design\n- Motion\n- Custom Music Track\n- SFX (Sound Design)\n- NFT & POAP Development\n- Source Files under CC0\n\n**110 ETH / 160K USD (approx)**\n\n## Proposed Transactions\n\n- [Multi-sig Gnosis Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x44ddf107C7B920312a98F4753Ba209443428c881/home) has been established at [neversitstill.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/neversitstill.eth)\n- Signers include [0xigami.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/0xigami.eth), [mrseaks.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/mrseaks.eth) and [a company address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2eF00c3860bC6Fe48b2508620a883E9b1f90d90F)\n- Upon receipt ETH will be swapped for USDC to hedge volatility\n- 50% upfront swapped for AUD, remaining 50% at completion\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ls1xRxa.png)",

      "content": "# NFT Fest Australia\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BDhKUAS.jpg)\n\n**Requesting 22 ETH** for [Nouns DAO'n Under](https://twitter.com/nounsau) to facilitate an IRL activation as the official \"optical sponsor\" of [NFT Fest Australia](https://nftfest.com.au/) in Melbourne from 23-24 November 2022.\n\nFollowing the continued success of [Nouns Fair](https://nouns.wtf/vote/162), the opportunity has arisen for Nouns to make a lasting impression at Australia's biggest NFT event, right when our local industry is popping off.\n\nThis proposal is brought to you by Aussie proliferatooooors: [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami), [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi), [Jarmen](https://twitter.com/jarmen43), [Mr Boney](https://twitter.com/theboneys), [ThaSwami](https://twitter.com/tha_swami) and [LilPurpBerry](https://twitter.com/lilpurpberry).\n\n## TL;DR\n\n**Showcase Nouns to Aussies** from iconic Melbourne, our cultural mecca for sports, music and the visual arts:\n\n1. **Dioramic POAP powered photo booth** activation so everyone can help us proliferate Nouns to 5,000+ attendees and potential DAO members\n2. **Live nounish panel discussion** alongside Kevin Rose, J1mmy, Zeneca, Cooper Turley, Anthony Sassano, Matty (DCLBlogger), Betty (Deadfellaz) and Kieran Warwick (Illuvium) [as announced here](https://twitter.com/NFTFestAus/status/1585080621843746817)\n3. **Noggles worn by event staff** with Nouns as the official \"optical sponsor,\" defining our own category inclusive of Gold sponsorship benefits\n4. **Street poster campaign** with 200 x A0 colour printed posters targeting the St Kilda area for the leadup and duration of the event\n\nDespite many Aussie nouners and builders, awareness of Nouns in Australia is surprisingly low. But our local industry is booming and we're a home to many Web3 builders, crypto investors and influential Ethereum personalities.\n\n*Global NFT adoption ([finder.com](https://www.finder.com.au/nft-statistics)):*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/x3EJ0vs.png)\n\n[Gnars DAO](https://gnars.com) will also be representing Nouns through Silver sponsorship and a screening of [our nounish film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQSmfSnRGVk). This engagement has already led to media partnership discussions with [ONE37pm](https://www.one37pm.com/) (Vayner Media) -- feature coverage coming soon!\n\n## NFT Fest Australia\n\n[NFT Fest](https://nftfest.com.au/) has attracted 5,000+ attendees across streaming platforms in previous events and will be running this November's event for over 1,000+ IRL attendees whilst making all content available for free a few weeks following the event. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Bj9rOqu.jpg)\n\nNFT Fest 2022 will include the who's who of Aussie Web3 as well as representation from all the major Aussie sports leagues and teams, business involvement from Salesforce, KPMG, Deloitte, EY and media publications such as The Chainsaw, ONE37pm, Australian Financial Review and Ticker News.\n\n### Dioramic POAP powered photo booth\n\nNouns-branded photo station tailored to Australian taste referencing culturally popular memes. Taking inspiration from the Nouns DAOmigos and their incredible success at ETH conferences:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5j9biPW.jpg)\n\nNounish stage props and noggles will be made accessible for attendees to share the joy of Nouns across social media. Expect it to be a \"bloody nounish shindig with all ya mates\" ‚Äì an invitation to join [Nouns DAO'n Under](https://twitter.com/nounsau).\n\n### Live nounish panel discussion\n\nLeaning on a previous [nounish panel discussion during NFT London](https://nftlondon.sessionize.com/session/382247), we will focus on explaining what it means to be nounish, through the lens of building atop Nouns DAO and highlighting case studies such as Gnars. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wgYSrFJ.jpg)\n\nThe goal of such an approach is to inspire others to come and build on Nouns while showing future nouners the potential unlocked by joining the DAO. Our own launch of Nouns DAO'n Under also serves as a [Nouns Builder](https://nouns.build) case study. \n\n### Noggles worn by event staff\n\nOur iconic noggles are wildly underutilised, especially in the context of collaborative branding and marketing opportunities. We are paving the way and defining our own category as the official \"optical sponsor.\" \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tb9UvSm.jpg)\n\nAdditional to Gold Sponsorship benefits: \n* Branding on the registration page \n* Panel speaking opportunity \n* Branding on homepage\n* Branding across social collateral \n* VIP access to all events\n* Speaker concierge service\n* Logo on media wall\n* Branding on NFT Fest '22 banners \n* Feature inserts\n* Bespoke collateral\n* Branding on ticket & event webpage\n* Branding on event collateral\n* Event ticket allocation\n* Inclusion in email communication to attendees pre/during/post event \n* NFT Fest social media channels recognition pre/during/post event\n\nNFT Fest's organisers and event staff have proudly agreed to wear noggles to show their appreciation, make the event unforgettably nounish and of course, have fun!\n\n### Street poster campaign\n\nTo raise awareness in the leadup to and during NFT Fest, we will print and distribute 200 x A0 sized street posters in key locations around St Kilda.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iUV8NCU.jpg)\n\nMr Boney has run similar campaigns in Melbourne to great effect. Prior to rebranding Douns to Nouns DAO'n Under, he received funding from Nouncil to run a tracked experiment and we're able to leverage the relationships built.\n\n## Nouns DAO Contribution\n\n**Required funding (22 ETH) as follows:**\n\n- Optical Sponsor package including Gold sponsorship (10 ETH)\n- Dioramic POAP powered photo booth activation (5 ETH)\n- Silver Sponsorship on behalf of Gnars DAO (3 ETH)\n- Merchandise to hand out during the event (2 ETH)\n- St Kilda targeted street poster campaign (2 ETH)\n\nWe trust that voters will appreciate the importance and foreseeable impact of making a lasting impression on the Australian scene. Especially considering the depth of current Aussie contributons despite nascent market penetration.\n\n### Funding receival\n\nWe've established a 3/5 multisig to receive the funds and the associated proliferatooooors are together co-nounders of [Nouns DAO'n Under](https://twitter.com/nounsau).\n\n* [Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami)\n* [Benbodhi](https://twitter.com/benbodhi)\n* [Jarmen](https://twitter.com/jarmen43)\n* [Mr Boney](https://twitter.com/theboneys)\n* [ThaSwami](https://twitter.com/tha_swami)",

We are asking for 23.25 ETH.\n\n## Context\nWe are NounsDAO Amigos. We are building a Spanish-speakers community for LatAm and beyond. We‚Äôve been proliferating the ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® adding some spice and a pinch of √ës.\n\nWe recently hosted the second edition of the Nouns Fair. An¬†IRL fun experience aimed to proliferate Nouns at the ETHBogota hackathon. We‚Äôve confirmed the importance of this kind of event that helps increase awareness of the DAO, onboard potential builders, and put noggles in the eyes of hundreds.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe1R5WFT9_E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe1R5WFT9_E)\n\nMore detailed info can be found here - [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326) & [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326/7?u=mono](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nsfw-nouns-fair-ethbogota/2326/7?u=mono)\n\n## Nouns Fair @ETHSanFrancisco\nGiven the success of the Nouns Fair in Colombia, **the ETHGlobal team invited NounsDAOAmigos to make a new edition, this time at ETHSanFrancisco!** We believe it‚Äôs important to keep having a presence at IRL events like this. As we saw in Mexico and Colombia, this is a great environment for spreading the ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® and growing our Spanish-speaker community.\n\n**Goals**\n- Make a new amigo, San Francisco\n- Onboard potential contributors\n- Put Nouns in the eyes of hundreds of builders\n\n**Details**\n\nPlace:¬†San Francisco, California\nVenue:¬†Palace of Fine Arts\nDates: November 4 - 6, 2022\nTeam: NounsDAOAmigos\n\nThe Nouns Fair will be a 3-day cultural experience focused on builders where they will be able to engage with others and learn about Nouns. This activation will be a localized nounish experience with photo opportunities, games, merchandise, and an NFT gallery. The proliferation of culture √° la nounish. The following are examples of what happened in Bogot√° and what we‚Äôll create for San Francisco with a different flavor:\n\n**Photo-opportunity & noggles**\nA fully Nouns-branded photo station where attendees can take selfies and full-body photos will serve as a welcoming station. We want to create a photo set where people can feel nounish and share it on the internet. Of course, physical noggles are key.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XGMsKWG.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/i9Ww7cU.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/W9LifGd.jpg)\n\n\n\n**Games**\nTwo different games will be available at the place: **foosball**, and **a traditional local game**. We believe these games have a nounish feeling and will serve as an engagement factor.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/14ONVu1.jpg)\n\n\n\n**Merchandise**\nPins, stickers, and T-shirts will be distributed as rewards for spending time and engaging with the Nouns Fair by playing games and taking photos.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TEqCnbF.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/exzjPyD.jpg)\n\n\n\n**NFT gallery**\nA 5 screens NFT gallery representing local artists and some nounish representatives.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SvvfxNS.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iCu328D.jpg)\n\n\n**Costs and execution**\nGiven our past experiences and the recent Nouns Fairs at ETHMexico and ETHBogota, we came up with this budget to make it suitable for ETHSanFrancisco in the US. **We are asking for 23.25 ETH**.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XSlixrD.png)\n\n\nCosts are approximate. ETH avg. price of 1,200 USD. Prices in red are not final and we'll seek to reduce costs as much as possible. The difference in these prices will be returned to the DAO.\n\nWe are excited about this new opportunity to keep creating nounish experiences IRL that can be replicated in other countries. But most of all, to spread the ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® in a fun way!\n\n**Transactions**\nDue to the time sensitive nature of this proposal, NSFW has already funded NounsDAOAmigos to execute on this project.  The 23.25 ETH transaction in this proposal will go to refund NSFW.\n\n",

Drive awareness and favorability of Nouns DAO as an innovative leader in the web3 space.\n2. Engage audiences outside of mainstream Web3 with Nouns brand.\n3. Build an authentic perspective through content that drives deeper interest in Nouns DAO.\n\n**Strategy**\n\n**TikTok** is the platform for **virality**. Trending content on TikTok has the ability to inspire people to take action and learn more about Nouns. We will be focusing on staying on top of the trends and tying it into Nouns DAO and Nouns projects. \n\nWe have a 1M views goal we are trying to reach, but the opportunity goes beyond the metrics. It is about increasing **brand awareness, favorability** and **engagement** with other builders, community members and the general public to grow the brand in a positive light and maximize our social presence.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mOTteC7.png)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PmsnOqf.png)\n\n*Nouns FAQ:*\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FRnb5Da.png)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5f23GnpTuk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5f23GnpTuk)\n\n\n**Innovation** - A new vtube avatar will be designed and used with AI technology to create educational Nouns content. We will be updating our graphics, music and other branding elements.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7dMac35.png)\n\n\n**Cross-Platform Approach** - In order to connect with unique audiences across all platforms, we will repurpose content to each of our social channels (TikTok, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Website). This gives us greater opportunities to rank in search - within the platforms and on Google.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/v14oFDX.png)\n\n\n**Collaborations** - Partnering with other Nouns projects and communities to showcase their nounish products/ideas/initiatives (from IRL projects, like Nouns OTG and Nouns Treasure Hunts, to Nounish product launches, like merch/coffee/goods).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RLBMo4u.png)\n\n\n*Nouns Vision Sunglasses Trend:*\n![](https://i.imgur.com/x8aGIjE.png)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCz3B4Q6adk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCz3B4Q6adk)\n\n**Contests & Giveaways** - Giveaways are one of the most powerful content types, as they are a great entry point for new members. We‚Äôd like to continue hosting weekly or bi-weekly contests, with ETH prizes and/or nounish products from our collaborations. We‚Äôd like to focus not only on rewarding new members online, **but also people who participate in public video shoots.**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/B1ek5UU.png)\n\n\n*Brandweek Miami 2022:*\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2BFwCU4.png)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6ey8FY-B0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6ey8FY-B0w)\n\n**Community Involvement** - We will interact with all the nounish communitites, delivering monthly reports on our progress and implementing new and creative ideas with their feedback.\n\n\n**BY THE NUMBERS**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/i6IO3Op.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oAWB1xy.png)\n\n\n\n*Some of the top performing posts:*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vpnaXVB.png)\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ8PJM9h1ys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ8PJM9h1ys)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wFbJ3KA.png)\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OmZuSnDYxY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OmZuSnDYxY)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iGwJwlt.png)\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A73BHeB1gM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9A73BHeB1gM)\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZK0hhaq.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Pis2hTv.png)\n\n\n**TEAM**\n\n\n**Director/Producer**\n**Leo Clark**: [@leoclark](https://twitter.com/leoclark), Discord:leoclark.eth ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®#2267\nFilmmaker @ Nouns DAO Prop #71 ‚Ä¢ Nouncillor ‚Ä¢ Producer/Speaker @ Nouns in Rio Prop #98.\n\n**Content Presenter/Host**\n**Nikki**: [@web3nikki](https://twitter.com/web3nikki), Discord:NonfungibleNikki#0001\nMiami-based web3 strategist at an influencer marketing agency.\n\n**Content Strategist**\n**Hypnos**: [@hypnoseffect](https://twitter.com/hypnoseffect), Discord:Hypnos#0007\nMiami-based former professional gamer.

Further empowering Roko to be an AI secretary/assistant for the DAO! Helping information flow better with summaries, transcripts, reviews, answering questions and more. \n2. Generating Nounish rich media (images, gifs, videos) and making the tools to generate such media accessible to the community at large to unleash their creativity\n3. Empowering other pods (e.g. ai-based team drafting for e-sports, planning events for otg)\n\nWith each of these being built with monetization / expansion to other organizations in mind.\n\n---\n\n### WELL HOW DID THE INITIAL RESEARCH GO?\n\nYou can see the initial small grant proposal here [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-the-nouns-ecosystem-and-ai/1929)  and Honk's extension post here [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-ai-honk-residency-extension/2357)\n\n![https://imgur.com/JPkgn07](https://imgur.com/JPkgn07.png)\n\n[https://staging.roko.dev/](https://staging.roko.dev/) Is a live website where the team is experimenting and adding features with the goal of building a production ready webapp.\n\nWe initially set out to accomplish two sprints, the first to be able to break down proposals into understandable summaries / reviews. The second was more focused on demonstrating some of the possibilities of AI and what it could bring to Nouns.\n\nI am happy to report that, thanks to an engaged community and support from key contributors Honk and Evets.eth we blew that goal out of the water.\n\nTogether, we:\n\n- Held weekly sessions on Tuesdays which about 30 people regularly attended that shared developments with the project as well as educating them on fundamentals as well as cutting edge developments in machine learning\n- Built a pipeline that can breakdown proposals into reviews automatically as they as proposed on-chain (and post them to Twitter!!)\n- Built pipeline to turn recorded calls into text using SOTA voice to text then using a large language model to convert them into a bulleted summary\n\n![https://imgur.com/voyrcfZ](https://imgur.com/voyrcfZ.png)\n\n- Built a web interface that enables participants to easily consume summarized proposal content as well as edit them to better reflect their opinions\n    - [https://staging.roko.dev/](https://staging.roko.dev/)\n- Tested the ability to finetune our model using user generated content as guidance\n- Setup a backend infrastructure setup to support the ongoing development and improvement of the web interface\n- In addition, due to popular demand we began diving deep into AI generated media, we were able to generate images and video content (reactive to sound!) that features custom content (Noggles!)\n\n![https://imgur.com/hCb6gWe](https://imgur.com/hCb6gWe.png)\n\n![https://imgur.com/J1KHLy6](https://imgur.com/J1KHLy6.png)\n\n![https://imgur.com/gKTir4X](https://imgur.com/gKTir4X.png)\n\n![https://imgur.com/Vd9t0po](https://imgur.com/Vd9t0po.png)\n\n[The AI pod promo Video!!](https://youtu.be/b5Ojfo6gVcU)\n\n---\n\n### NEXT STEPS: THE AI POD\n\nThe proposed AI Pod will have 3 main focuses:\n\n1. Continue Bringing Roko to life in the form of an AI Assistant to DAO members:\n- All Nouners and teams of funded props should have access to Roko's summarization capabilities for their related audio or text content (as long as they provide feedback on their results!!)\n- Work towards improving Roko‚Äôs corpus of data (e.g. Discourse posts, Discord messages) and learn how to incorporate these into a model to improve Roko‚Äôs Nounish knowledge base.\n- Roko's website could also be updated to include a search page where people could semantically search across that knowledge base whether it is just meeting / proposal content or if Discord / Discourse content was included.\n2. Explore AI Generated Media\n- Implement and host SOTA open source image generation models customized to be able to generate Noggles on powerful GPU servers so any DAO member can access it. \n- Implement cutting edge developments as they are released (e.g. text to video, img to img, text to 3d, etc.), share our knowledge with the community, and incentivize their use!\n3. Community Engagement, Marketing, and Outreach (Competitions!!)\n- Put together competitions (with prizes!!) alongside groups like NoC to show off the best showcases of AI generated media leveraging Nouns AI tooling.\n- Assist various pods and DAO members with content generation - we've already had suggestions from helping visualize proposals to making and AI content generated coffee book and I know the community will have plenty more great ideas!!\n- Potential prop house round for utilizing the tooling?\n- Seek out partnerships with these opensource or other organizations to see if they would be interested in collaborating to try and further proliferate the brand!\n    - I‚Äôd LOVE to see us partner with some musicians to work with them to make them free music videos they could post that have Noun glasses in them or have a live show with AI generated visuals featuring Noggles\n\n---\n\n### THE FUTURE OF AI POD:\n\nHopefully, during these three months, we will be able to not only share significant advancements in AI with the community, but also have a plan for how to take the next steps to grow the AI Pod further.\nWe want to be able to show a path where this could become a self-sustaining effort that could grow and expand to other organizations, opening up a pipeline for monetization.\nWe believe that this is a great opportunity to only grow and expand the Nouns ecosystem but give everyone who is a part of it superpowers that help proliferating the meme!!\n\n---\n\n### TEAM:\n\n- The Hero Shep (Background in AI/Education/Product Management)\n- Honk Diddly (Wizard [elite full stack developer])\n- Evets.ETH (Wizard [full stack developer])\n\n---\n\n### BUDGET: 164 ETH\n\n- 10% for all related infra (5k/mo)\n- 30% for The Hero Shep (20k per month)\n- 25% for Honk (15k per month)\n- 15% for Evets.ETH (10k per month)\n- 20% for Marketing and Community Engagement (Not only compensation for prizes but also to pay people to manage / run the competitions (e.g. prop house, NOC contests) & support other initiatives that arise. )\n\nBUFFER of 15% for volatility - All ETH not used strictly for reasons relating to volatility in ETH price or infra will be added to the Marketing and Community Engagement Funds\n\nThis budget will be governed by the members of the AI Pod and controlled by a 2/3 multi-sig.",

      "content": "# CDT Work Continuation\n\nHey all, my name is Christian. Working on Nouns full-time has been an amazing opportunity. I'd like to continue my work for the next 6 months as well. It's been an incredible learning experience, and I love building projects that serve the DAO and bring joy to the Nouns community.\n\n### **Overview of what I‚Äôve done the last 6 months:**\n## **[PROP HOUSE](https://prop.house/)**\nI spent most of my time working on the **complete site redesign**. Besides making it more aesthetically pleasing, and cleaning up the codebase (removing unused code as we prepared to open-source it), I worked on new features to **increase the overall user experience** including:\n**-** New homepage with statistics\n**-** Dynamic social sharing cards\n**-** House & Round pages\n**-** Voting progress bar\n**-** User proposal progress card\n**-** Japanese translations\n**-** Rich text editor for prop creation\n**-** Search bar for Home, FAQ, House, and Round pages\n\n![prophouse](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/1/190db5ad7841b57c47f1765534f99ea4ea514aaf_2_1380x832.jpeg)\n\n\n\n## **[NOUNS CENTER](https://nouns.center/)**\nThe site has received **18K total site visits** and is officially **linked from the Docs tab** of [nouns.wtf](https://nouns.wtf/). It has been forked by 4 NFT communities: Lil Nouns, Mfers, Blitmap, and Forgotten Runes to be used as a tool for their community. I did automation work with Brian to allow for projects and talent to add themselves more easily as the site scales. I also shipped several new pages and updates: \n**-** Funding (plus 3 funding guides: proposals, small grants, and prop house)\n**-** SubDaos\n**-** Dev Center (Docs, APIs, contract links, and Github repos)\n**-** Discord Channels\n**-** Learn (educational content from Nouncil YouTube)\n**-** Ideas\n**-** New assets (2 Figma boards, updated color palette, and 3D voxel noggles files)\n**-** New homepage\n\n![nounscenter](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/d/dd1863e672d5828dce841f6074f1110d5bcaa06f_2_1380x834.png)\n\n## **[NOUN O' TALK](http://nounotalk.com/)**\nI released **14 episodes** with **33 guests**. They included: \n***-** Personal deep dives*: 4156, Vape, and Brian Flynn\n***-** Communities*: the Nouncil and 4 subDAOs \n***-** Topical*:  eSports, Noundry, and NFT NYC\n***-** Builders*:  Fomo Nouns, Design System, Nouns Terminal, and Roko\n\nThe pod has garnered **~2,400 downloads**. I personally edited all past episodes. I recently brought on 2 producers to increase the quality. The next push will be YouTube. I created a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR5cYWsmNUELNY7-txoba-Q) (69 subscribers) so that we can upload full episodes, as well as 3-5 video clips, each week. I am personally a big YouTube user for podcasts and I believe this will be a great way to spread the word about Nouns on a platform we don't have a huge presence in. \n\n![new_episodes](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/2X/c/ce7a16ae87085bcb48ad405ed1a84ab0daff1ddd_2_1380x832.jpeg)\n\n### **What I plan to work on for the next 6 months:**\n\n## **[PROP HOUSE](https://prop.house/)**\nI will **continue developing the Prop House web app**. As we prepare for the protocol launch, I will work on fixing bugs and frontend improvements, as I manage the vast majority of the frontend you see. I will add Spanish translations to the site and I will continue to ensure it's the best tool that it can be.\n\n## **[NOUNS CENTER](https://nouns.center/)**\nI'd like to [conduct a Prop House round](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/small-grants-prop-house-design-round-for-nouns-center/2601) for a proper redesign of the entire site and lead the development to create a **Nouns Center v2**. I will add documentation, as in a README with install instructions, and clean up the code to make it fork-friendly for other communities. I aim to **implement Search** across the entire site for easier access to all the information. I plan to **add translations** (Japanese & Spanish) too.\n\n## **[NOUN O' TALK](http://nounotalk.com/)**\nI will continue to book guests, do my own extensive interview prep, and **host the pod** itself. I also **manage the podcast team** (Messhup for art and Matthew & Brileigh, our two producers). Besides the weekly podcast I want to grow and **proliferate Nouns via YouTube** as I mentioned above. Lastly, I'd like to create a custom site for nounotalk.com.\n\n### **Funds requested:**\n\n$175K* paid over 6 months in USDC which equates to ~132E by todays valuation.\n\n*the equivalent of ~$190k (to absorb potential volatility in ETH from time period between submission and execution) would  be sent to a multisig managed by trusted members of the community (Seneca, Steve, and cdt), they would then convert $175k worth of ETH to USDC, set up the stream and then send back the remaining ETH to the DAO.\n\nThe safe to handle cdt's transaction was created at `0xBD910e42a051da2252EB87B6f43d5E6e7cA85E3c`.\n\nSigners:\nseneca: `0xfC9e8dB5E255439F430e058462360Dd52b87cB4f`\ncdt: `0x1Bf87eAd2Fc2A4751CF5Bda011E5Afa320391cc2`\nsteve: `0x7D81478Ad18ad375e53De6F74F3122F6be3499ca`\n\nRecipient\ncdt's address: `0x1Bf87eAd2Fc2A4751CF5Bda011E5Afa320391cc2`",

      "content": "# Agora Continuation [revised]\n*This is a revised version of the Agora continuation prop based on community feedback. We've clarified our deliverables, increased transparency, reduced the ask by 20%, and implemented a payment stream*\n\n## TL;DR\nWe‚Äôd like to seek funding to keep developing [Agora](https://www.nounsagora.com/) in order to improve the governance efficacy of Nouns through delegation. Our goal is to significantly increase the participation rate of nouns through a combination of software improvements, and delegation drive programs over the next quarter.\n\n## Progress so far\nWe got [funded](https://prop.house/proposal/1023) on August 31 via Prop House mandates to build an MVP. In less than one month, we‚Äôve built a delegate platform for voters to broadcast what they want to see, and for builders to find voters who might support their proposal. To illustrate the outcome with some numbers, so far we‚Äôve seen:\n\n* 19 statements from delegates representing 127 nouns (>25% of all votes!)\n* 25 statements from builders who are seeking delegation\n* 5 nouns delegated via Agora (that we know of)\n* Hosted a delegate race to ‚Äúauction‚Äù 3 more votes to delegates\n* Proposal passed to deploy on lil nouns, as well as inbound interest from many other DAOs\n\nIn sum, Agora has created a hub that turned delegation from an invisible, behind the scenes activity, to something the community can see, participate in, discuss, and improve upon.\n\n## Roadmap & Goals\nNow that we‚Äôve landed an MVP of a delegate platform, it‚Äôs time to start leveraging it to meaningfully drive delegation & governance participation. We expect to complete these goals and achieve their resulting outcome in roughly one quarter. Note that all points here consist of our best plan of attack today, but as we continue to build Agora, we expect the roadmap to naturally evolve as we double down on what‚Äôs working, and deprioritize what‚Äôs not.\n\n**Goal 1: Dramatically reduce friction to delegation:**\n* Integrate with nouns.wtf to propose ‚Äúpost-win‚Äù delegate suggestions\n* Enable direct delegation on Agora (where today we borrow the nouns.wtf flow)\n* Enable time-bound, fractional, and supercedable delegation by a proxy contract to unblock funds & whales who are currently unwilling to delegate\n* Productize delegate race so that Nouners who don‚Äôt want to pick a delegate can let the community pick for them\n\n**Goal 2: Make governance and delegation more transparent and easy to understand**\n* Continue investing in surfacing more delegate and voting data on Agora\n* Build a governance activity feed that highlights delegation, ownership change, voting, and other governance related activities.\n* Make other general improvements to Agora to make it a first class experience for governance participants\n\n**Goal 3: Activate nouns holders to either vote or delegate**\n* Direct outreach to inactive Nouners from Agora team to find them a suitable delegate\n* Implement an inactive nouner bounty program, highlighting and incentivizing the community to reach out to inactive holders.\n* Run a marketplace experiment to allow anyone to rent votes from Nouns holders\n* Run a direct reward (in both ETH and NFT prizes) experiment to directly incentivize voting\n\n**Target objectives in 3 months:**\n* 75% of new nouns are delegated to voters who vote on more than 50% of props they're eligible to\n* 50% participation in a rolling average of past 3 proposals\n\n## Transparency & decentralization\nAs a governance platform, we will take measures to maintain transparency and avoid centralization of power by taking the following measures: \n* Make Github repo public within 1 month (with proper documentation to come over time)\n* Publish all data monthly to public google sheets, or equivalent (such as API or onchain mirror)\n* Current Agora team members added together will commit to not represent more than 5% of nouns.\n\n## Team\nYitong ‚Äì Project lead & designer: co-founder of Vector DAO, and previously design + product at Coinbase. Prop builder for #87, contributor to Nouns Vision, delegate.\n\n0xcaff ‚Äì Engineer: Built the v1 of Agora, previously engineer at Coinbase.\n\nTom Taubkin ‚Äì Protocol Engineer: Contributor to several defi projects, previously engineer at Coinbase\n\nMrtn ‚Äì Ops / Community: Delegate from nounlets, funded via Prop House as governance historian, deployed Agora on lil nouns, previously pm on nouns.builder, and pm at Google.\n\n## Funding request & terms\n**Funding request:**\n\nWe‚Äôd like to request $221,000 to fund the team for a quarter (170ETH @ $1300/ETH, a 20% decrease from previous ask) and 20 ETH to incentivize voter participation.\n\n**Fund transfer mechanics**\n\n50% of the team portion & the participation incentive will be immediately deposited to the team‚Äôs wallet\n\n50% of the team portion will be streamed over a period of three months from a 3/5 multisig held by trusted members of the community. Signers for this safe will be: Elad, Krel, Yitong, Seneca, and one more to be confirmed.\n\nAs of this writing, $221,000 is 170 ETH. In order to account for ETH volatility, we will request a 30 ETH buffer. Upon fund release, $221,000 worth of ETH will be sold, with half deposited to the Agora multisig, and half deposited to the stream multisig. The remaining ETH will be sent back to the treasury.\n\n## Appendix: some illustrative mocks\nThese are purely concepts to illustrate some of the areas we‚Äôre going to invest in. We‚Äôll need to iterate on these designs a lot before implementing them, so please take them as general directions vs exact specs.\n\n ![](https://i.imgur.com/WiopwP2.gif)\n*Enable time-bound, fractional, and supercedable delegation by a proxy contract to unblock funds & whales who are currently unwilling to delegate*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jhXYctm.png)\n*Implement an inactive nouner bounty program, highlighting and incentivizing the community to reach out to inactive holders.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/uFmaeEI.png)\n*Run a direct reward (in both ETH and NFT prizes) experiment to directly incentivize voting*\n",

The proposal shall run for 3 months on an experimental base to see if we as a DAO manage to incentivise people enough to stay on NSFW and share the burden of responsibility. \n\nIf effective, we can then continue to pay those active members until the current funding runs out. \n\nCurrent active members are:\n- Noun 12 (multi-sig)\n- Noun 16 (multi-sig)\n- Noun 22 (multi-sig)*\n- skilift (multi-sig)\n- Jarmen\n- maty\n- Oni\n- Sam Ellis\n- wiz\n- eoj\n*Noun 22 is excluded from the calculation, as he is currently compensated for his involvement with NSFW.\n\nFor any member that won‚Äôt be actively participating in these three months the DAO would terminate the payment for this individual and would expect them to be removed or replaced.\n\nI would expect once everyone is onboarded that each member has a function and a role within NSFW. If members can‚Äôt participate, they are urged to remove themselves and return the funds to the treasury.\n\nTotal ask 216 ETH.\n\nI suggest to send send the ETH to the NSFW multi-sig, from where it will get distributed to the individual contributors on a monthly base.\n",

      "content": "# Nouns DAO V2 Upgrade\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal updates the Nouns DAO logic contract to a new version, with the following improvements and additions:\n\n1. **Dynamic Quorum**: In V1, quorum is a fixed percentage of total supply. In V2, quorum has a dynamic range, rising as a function of against votes up to a defined cap. Read [this post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE) for more info.\n2. **Vote with Gas Refund**: Allow Nouners/delegates to vote and receive a gas refund. The vote still takes place in the case of insufficient ETH to refund.\n3. **Voting Delay Editing Bug Fix**: In V1, editing voting delay was unsafe. V2 makes it safe to edit anytime. More info on the bug [here](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-diligence/blob/main/reports/proposal-58.md#major).\n4. **Cancel Proposal Bug Fix**: The DAO has a spam mitigation feature, allowing anyone to cancel a proposal if the proposer has an amount of votes less than or equal to proposal threshold. In V1, this feature didn't work when proposer had exactly proposal threshold votes; in V2 it works as expected.\n5. **Vetoer Change Is Now 2-step**: We received audit feedback that V1's vetoer change process was risky as a single-step process. In V2, the risk of setting a wrong vetoer is mitigated using a 2-step process where the current vetoer sets a pending new vetoer. Once set, the pending vetoer must accept for the change to take place.\n\n## Audit\n\n1. The code has gone through internal reviews and a [code4rena audit](https://code4rena.com/reports/2022-08-nounsdao/).\n2. **No high-risk issues were found in V2**.\n3. **Unrelated to this proposal**, one high-risk issue was found. See [this audit summary on discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-dao-v2-audit-summary/2525) for more information.\n\n\n## Dynamic Quorum Parameters\n\nAs articulated in this [detailed post](https://mirror.xyz/0x10072dfc23771101dC042fD0014f263316a6E400/96zSoFfiT_RM2o2P9UbVKxPzVpB_trZqUjzllBE00BE), three parameters need to be set for dynamic quorum. This proposal sets their values, and we‚Äôre offering the thinking behind them here:\n\n1. **Minimum quorum %**: keeping it at 10%, the same as today‚Äôs quorum.\n2. **Maximum quorum %**: setting it to 15%, taking into account recent participation levels around 30%, allowing proposals with more than 15% For votes to be decided by simple majority; the intent is for this value to provide extra protection from voter apathy, while allowing most all proposals to be decided by simple majority rather than quorum.\n3. **Coefficient**: setting it to 1, such that each against vote raises the quorum requirement by one vote, until the maximum quorum is reached.\n\nThese parameters can be edited at any time via a proposal; treat these values as the first experiment.\n\n## Vote with Gas Refund\n\nA bit more on how this feature works:\n\n1. Governance clients (like nouns.wtf/vote) need to update their code to support it.\n2. Refunds are subject to certain constraints:\n    1. Gas base fee is capped at 200 gwei.\n    2. Gas priority fee is capped at 2 gwei.\n    3. Total gas is capped at 200K, supporting voting reason text up to roughly 9,190 characters.\n    4. If the contract‚Äôs balance is insufficient, voter will receive a partial refund.\n3. This feature requires the DAO to maintain the DAO contract‚Äôs ETH balance, which should be done via periodic ETH transfer proposals from the treasury to the DAO contract (this proposal performs the first funding).\n4. The DAO can choose to withdraw refund ETH back into the treasury at any time via a proposal.\n\n\n## Proposal Transactions for Humans\n\n1. `_setImplementation`: upgrades DAO logic to V2.\n2. `_setDynamicQuorumParams`: sets dynamic quorum params to:\n    1. Minimum quorum BPs: 10% (1000 basis points).\n    2. Maximum quorum BPs: 15% (1500 basis points).\n    3. Coefficient: 1 (1,000,000 in unsigned integer with 6 decimal places).\n3. `transfer`: funding vote refunds with 12 ETH, which should be enough for just over 100 proposals at today's participation rate (excluding honk‚Äôs tendency to paste long paragraphs).\n\nAs always, please reach out in the¬†[#54-tech-grants](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/981584123225321503)¬†channel in Discord with any questions ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®.",

      "content": "# heyanoun - pseudonymous messages about props\n\n*thanks to Will Price for the delegated noun allowing us to make this proposal*\n\n### tl;dr\n\nA way for snapshotted nouners at a given proposal to pseudonymously submit messages about the proposal.\n\n### proposal\n\nWe believe that Nouns DAO is where the most interesting public DAO conversation is happening today. \n\nSometimes, not every opinion held is voiced though. In the past month of participating more in the DAO (noun 416), we‚Äôve observed situations where privately held opinions don‚Äôt make it to the public discourse because they‚Äôre somewhat controversial. We believe that this is dangerous for governance. Unspoken and unresolved opinions can fester into resentment and political turmoil over time.\n\nWith this in mind, we‚Äôre building heyanoun, a way for nouners snapshotted by a proposal to comment on that proposal pseudonymously. \n\n![heyanoun mock](https://i.ibb.co/3BkBdHw/Untitled.png)\n\nNouners post a message on the heyanoun site, along with a zero-knowledge proof showing that they are in the snapshot to the relevant prop:\n\nMessages will then be passed on to a designated channel (initially could just be the funded prop‚Äôs channel) in the nouns discord server:\n\n![discord mock](https://i.ibb.co/9n3zpPW/Untitled-1.png)\n\nAll proofs will be hosted on IPFS and messages will have a link from which a user on discord can verify the proof‚Äôs veracity themselves.\n\nWe believe that this product, while simple, can surface unspoken opinions to the nouns public square and could be a huge boon to governance.\n\n### about us\n\nPersonae Labs is a new R&D lab out of [0xPARC](https://0xparc.org/) investigating how new cryptography like ZK-SNARKs changes the way we communicate online. \n\nRead our manifesto [here](https://www.notion.so/Personae-Labs-d46a90c64953416eb386a0ae2ee7679b) or watch this recent announcement talk from one of our founders [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpb1RkUoWEw).\n\nWe‚Äôve built (to our knowledge) the earliest Eth-based pseudonymous social apps like [https://www.heyanon.xyz/](https://www.heyanon.xyz/) and [https://www.cabal.xyz/](https://www.cabal.xyz/) and are committed to furthering the technical and product frontiers here. \n\nFind us at \n\n- [https://twitter.com/personae_labs](https://twitter.com/personae_labs)\n- personaelabs.eth\n- noun 416\n\n### compensation\n\nWe foresee this project taking ~1.5mo. of dedicated effort by a team of:\n\n- 2 engineers\n- 1 designer\n- 1 PM\n\nComponents to be delivered:\n\n1. website for submitting message + ZKPs for all proposals\n2. all relevant zkp circuits\n3. discord bot for posting messages\n4. website for verifying proofs of messages (from bot)\n\nGiven a rate of 10 ETH/mo for each contributor, we‚Äôre requesting **60 ETH total** for delivery of this first app.  \n\n### future work\n\nWe hope this app is the first of many experiments around pseudonymity within Nouns DAO.\n\nIf this first iteration sees traction, we see a number of further extensions:\n\n- extend the number of places that messages are published, i.e. to a dedicated twitter account as well as discord\n- plugins/react components to integrate pseudonymous badges/proving into other governance clients (i.e. agora, discourse killer)\n- additional pseudonymous nouner groups, i.e. groups based on voting history (I voted in 10 of last 15 proposals)\n",

It's an opportunity to celebrate nounishness, reinforce our culture, and create new traditions.\n\nWe want the Noundry to become a continuous event, a new tradition, and a significant driver of Nouns proliferation within artistic circles. In that light, the compensation outlined in this proposal is not just about the work that was completed, but also about future signaling.\n\nWe think one of the most exciting possible outcomes of the Noundry would be if every artist in the world aspires to put their artwork into the Nouns contract (and by extension, the public domain). And while high compensation may not be the primary motivator, it can help initiate the right feedback loop and create the breeding ground needed for future Noundrys to thrive.\n\n## Compensation\n\n### Winner compensation\n*[https://nouns.wtf/vote/125](https://nouns.wtf/vote/125) (Integrate 8/8 Anniversary Art)*\n\nNoundry Season 0 winners are compensated per winning trait. Artists with multiple winning submissions are rewarded for each submission.\n\nNoun Head traits are more generously compensated as they are the most visually striking, tend to create the most excitement within the community, and are responsible for driving much of the Twitter discourse and enthusiasm around the Noundry.\n\n- **Head trait winners**\n    - Facu x 3 (Snowman, Vending Machine, Wine Barrel)\n    - Gremplin x 2 (Capybara, Treasure Chest)\n    - LuckyCryptoCats x 1 (Hanger)\n    - Goldy x 1 (Couch)\n    - Modrovsky x 1 (Index Card)\n- **Accessory trait winners**\n    - Fuyu x 2 (Uroko, Tatewaku)\n    - JMA Nountris x 1 (Grease)\n\n*Note: Gremplin declined compensation for the two glasses traits added in the upgrade, arguing that there should be a minimum degree of effort required for compensation.*\n\n**Winning traits compensation**\n- Heads: 15 eth / trait\n    - (8 x 15 = 120 eth)\n- Accessories: 4 eth / trait\n    - (3 x 4 = 12 eth)\n- **Total: 132 eth**\n\n### Curation committee compensation\nThe curation committee played a crucial role in making Noundry Season 0 a success. They are compensated for organizing the event, curating, and fine-tuning the winning contributions. \n\nIt's hard to put a figure value on the committee's efforts ‚Äî in many ways it's priceless. We propose compensating the committee with a symbolic sum of 10.69 eth to distribute as they see fit.\n\n- Committee members for Season 0:\n    - Goldy\n    - Gremplin\n    - 4156\n    - 9999\n    - Solimander\n- **Total: 10.69 eth**\n\n### Summary\n- Winner compensation: 132 eth\n- Committee: 10.69 eth\n- **Total compensation: 142.69 eth**\n\n### Transactions\n- 45 eth to Facu\n    - 0x82d1f493FeB2639318045f2C5dDd4B1d0653aa29\n- 30 eth to Gremplin\n    - 0x4298e663517593284Ad4FE199b21815BD48a9969\n- 15 eth to Goldy\n    - 0x021edd67d43B365a6401a5Ee704Aa6f264F3F4e4\n- 15 eth to LuckyCryptoCats\n    - 0xD840369402683782263511d76C99e9D50Dc37D2C\n- 15 eth to Modrovsky\n    - 0xb8a9Ed8D008FA1F161809f15a11F4161FB8b717e\n- 8 eth to Fuyu\n    - 0x4F4bD77781cEeE4914B6bC16633D5437eaBCa5D3\n- 4 eth to JMA Nountris\n    - 0x55a25cce1737E4692Fc243B6C26364DAED7f2486\n- 10.69 eth to Gnosis Safe with 3/5 signers\n    -  0x8a4eb8f3383909a8138101F6E17cd8281a26eA3a\n\n**Multisig signers**\n\n- (maty) 0xDEAD753f9B1eb8F2f7372E8587e7C6e342daac89\n- (krel) 0xFFb0E93F7e315BECcF0757845F3eF2cB9832efB9\n- (elad) 0xfe9b3ab16AfeF3B28C0c3dfA6fa7C5b58f5c06aA\n- (9999) 0x6223Bc5fd16a19bcFAe2281dDE47861CFE1023eE\n- (142)  0xE6232ed3436C4065D38D8BFdC8EA90858ecDfa69",

Total ask of 25 eth.\n\nWe believe the community is largely to thank for making Noundry into something more than a mere contest. Instead, the Noundry evolved into a collaborative experience ‚Äî a festival ‚Äî where artists from around the world came together to inspire and build upon each other's ideas, using Nouns pixel art as a canvas to unite around.\n\nThe artwork we eventually added to the Nouns Descriptor contract resulted from a group effort and would not have been the same without the participation of the larger community.\n\nWith this proposal, we want to acknowledge that the collaborative, explorative side of the Noundry is as vital as the outcome and hope to set an example for upcoming Noundrys.\n\nCompensation\nCommunity compensation\nWe think community compensation is best left to the community to decide. The alternatives would be equal distribution to all participants or attempting the almost impossible task of centrally deciding who had a meaningful impact on the Noundry. None of these options feel exciting or in the spirit of the Noundry.\n\nTo manage this, we're using Coordinape, a community compensation platform, and want to allocate a pool of 24 eth for the Noundry season 0 community to split up amongst themselves.\n\nCoordinape rules\n\nParticipants eligible to vote: https://hackmd.io/@krel/noundry-coordinape\nEach participant receives three votes\nParticipants allocate votes based on who they think had the largest positive impact on their own experience\nParticipants cannot vote for themselves\nParticipants cannot vote for artists with winning traits in Noundry Season 0\nFacu, Gremplin, Goldy, Modrovsky, LuckyCryptoCats, Fuyu, Nountris\nTotal: 24 eth\n\nSummary\nCoordinape round: 24 eth\nAdministration (run by maty): 1 eth\nTotal compensation: 25 eth\nTransactions\n1 eth to maty\n0x3E3928d651b431608F81Dd1129a56344d6A256EC\n24 eth to Gnosis Safe with 3/5 signers\n0x8a4eb8f3383909a8138101F6E17cd8281a26eA3a\nMultisig signers\n\n(maty) 0xDEAD753f9B1eb8F2f7372E8587e7C6e342daac89\n(krel) 0xFFb0E93F7e315BECcF0757845F3eF2cB9832efB9\n(elad) 0xfe9b3ab16AfeF3B28C0c3dfA6fa7C5b58f5c06aA\n(9999) 0x6223Bc5fd16a19bcFAe2281dDE47861CFE1023eE\n(142) 0xE6232ed3436C4065D38D8BFdC8EA90858ecDfa69\nProposed Transactions\n0x3e3928d651b431608f81dd1129a56344d6a256ec.transfer(\n‚ÄÉ1.0 ETH\n)\n0x8a4eb8f3383909a8138101f6e17cd8281a26ea3a.transfer(\n‚ÄÉ24.0 ETH\n)",

Most of the amazing projects that Nouns funds need help telling their story, and video is the best way to do so.\n\nIt is safe to assume that without the videos we published, Nouns DAO would have missed the opportunity of amplifying the stories of these wonderful projects. \n\nWith video, we are able to tell a much deeper and colorful story and evoke much more emotion. We believe this must be 10Xed to recruit more builders to help the meme proliferate. \n\n## The Nouns Funnel\n\nWe think of builder & community onboarding as a funnel: \n\n\n\n* **Top of Funnel**: People who heear about Nouns from a friend, stumble upon a Nouns project in their city, enjoy a piece of nouns art on twitter etc. \n* **Middle of Funnel**: People who become curious to understand what Nouns are, want to learn how to get funded, or want to join the community.\n* **Bottom of Funnel**: People who are ready to submit a proposal, buy a noun (or nounlet), or to join the community or a sub DAO.\n\n\nIn the next 6 months we want to focus on the **Middle of the Funnel**. We want to help explain what Nouns are to the world and get many more people noun-pilled. \n\n**Why focus on Middle of Funnel first and not Top of Funnel?**\n\nThe majority of people that have heard of Nouns do not really grok what it is, never-mind all the potential builders outside the NFT bubble that we are missing out on because it‚Äôs too esoteric to dive in to. In reality, almost no one gets what we‚Äôre doing, and it‚Äôs impossible for them to have a vision for Nouns.\n\nThe hurdle to understand what Nouns is and how to interact with the community is absurdly high for someone not native to our ecosystem.\n\nIt‚Äôs imperative that there‚Äôs quality consumable content out there that helps people **not only understand what Nouns is doing but be inspired to join in**. What we need is social media channels (eg. YouTube and Instagram) that have a significant catalogue of content you can just sit and consume. \n\n* We are going to try to answer questions that are not easily answered today like:\n\t* **‚ÄúSo what does nouns actually do and stand for?\"**\n\t\t* This is a branding exercise, this is key for our work to answer.\n\t* **‚ÄúWhat is Nouns actually to me?‚Äù**\n\t\t* The answer is not NFTs, or a DAO (that is just infrastructure), it's an open source brand that you can be funded to build on (or build on permissionlessly). It‚Äôs an energised and broad community. It‚Äôs a movement. We need to demonstrate this through our videos.\n\t* **‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a nounish concept / proposal?‚Äù**\n\t\t* Current way to understand this: read hundreds of proposals on nouns.wtf/vote, tally their results, investigate if they were ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù or not, if the dao likes them, analyse all this data‚Ä¶ etc. What if instead they could watch a handful of nounish videos that show the things we‚Äôre proud of?\n\t* **‚ÄúHow do I get funded?‚Äù**\n\t\t* Videos about this will be hugely valuable, currently it takes a lot of effort to understand this. Our top priority here is to make a few videos focused exclusively on getting funded via Prop House and then other videos about the other ways as a whole, and individual videos on specifics (on chain, nsfw etc.)\n\t* **‚ÄúCan it be any cultural domain?‚Äù**\n\t\t* Here are some screenshots from version 1 of our intro. We will continue to experiment and iterate with ways to tell this story all the time. This is hugely important to be understood if we want to experiment in every vertical.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xeVv9Yh.jpg)\n\n## What we will deliver as part of this prop\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VfTyQw4.gif)\n\n\n### Nounish across all social networks\n\nWe will spend the next 6 months churning out high quality video content about Nouns and its builders. \n\nWe plan to work on all major Social Media networks. We have started building a following on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nounish) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thats_nounish/). We will also invest more cycles into building out our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100082280520913) & [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thats_nounish) presence. \n\nBut our main focus will be on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/nounish), where you can expect our channel to become the easiest way to get into the Nouns rabbit hole and come out understanding all the key concepts of the DAO, as well as learn about the most inspiring projects being built on the protocol.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mJGFJA6.jpg)\n*Our YouTube channel will become a video learning hub for everything nouns-related*\n\n### Videos about the most inspiring proposals\n\nThere are so many amazing stories to tell about nouns-funded projects that can get so much more depth with good video content covering them. \n\nHere are some of the proposals we would love to make content about! \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8t1RQ4Q.gif)\n\n**LONG FORM Candidates (not exhaustive)**\n* Rose parade / Stoopid Buddy\n* E Sports\n* Nouns Fashion: Nouns Brand & Dopamine & Danit Peleg & Madhappy\n* Xanadu\n* Prop House\n* Dustin Ep 2\n* Free Glasses Ep 2\n* Edible Nouns: Moonbeans + Nouns Coffee\n* Children's Book\n* Luxury Glasses\n* NounWorks: Fun Frames, Pins, etc.\n* The Wizard's Hat\n* Sofubi Dolls\n* The Noun Square\n* Nounish\n\n**SHORT FORM Candidates (not exhaustive)**\n* Mucho Love\n* John Hamon\n* Noundry\n* Nouns front ends\n* Nouns Brazil\n* Nouns Comics\n* CC0 Spacebank\n* Bidder POAP\n* Goat Club / Memes\n* 3D Nouns\n* iOS App\n* Coloring Books\n* Super Bowl commercial\n* Murals, posters, art around the world\n\n\n### Nouns Explained (bitesized & long-form)\n\nWe want to make it easy for anyone to understand Nouns and the DAO. And specifically, we want to help onboard potential builders. \n\nWe will create a suite of high quality videos explaining the key concepts of Nouns.\n\nSome of the concepts we would like to produce videos for:\n* What is Prop House and how to get funded\n* What can you build on Nouns?\n* What is Noun O'Clock\n* What is FOMO and how does it work\n* What is CC0?\n* How do props get funded?\n* Where to start with Nouns DAO?\n* How does the Nouns auction work?\n* What happens when you join Nouns DAO?

In June, the 1st international NFT event in Brazil took place in the city. Gathering renowned Brazilian artists, collections of different styles and lectures about web3, NFTs and DAOs, NFT Rio showed the potential of the Brazilian market.\n\nThe Nouns DAO featured as one of the main collections during the event. [After the approval of proposal 98](https://nouns.wtf/vote/98), [@beautyandpunk](https://twitter.com/beautyandpunk), [@leoclark](https://twitter.com/leoclark) and [@fabioseva](https://twitter.com/fabioseva) did a great job spreading the noun culture at the conference. We want to further develop this work.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mohS5HA.png)\n\nFor this, the plan is to:\n## 1) Promote 4 educational workshops about web3 in Gigoia Island, Rio de Janeiro/RJ.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/x4A8LV0.png)\n*Bob Burnquist with the teenagers from the Skate Cuida Institute*\n\nThe workshops are divided in 4 stages:\n**a) Wallets and tokens:** first, a ‚Äúmagic trick‚Äù makes money disappear‚Ä¶ and reappear inside the pocket of an attendee. The instructor explains what are ‚Äúthe secret crypto words‚Äù, how they can ‚Äúcontrol magic internet money‚Äù, and how anyone - even kids - can earn, use or store such money.\n\n**b) NFTs:** the instructor shows attendees how digital wallets can hold other digital stuff. A series of these valuable things have been scattered through the Skate Cuida Institute (QR codes linking to a minting page). A treasure hunt leads attendees to earn their first NFTs.\n\n**c) DAO:** the instructor shows a site where they can use their NFTs as tickets to join a club. He tells them there is a proposal there where they can vote for a prize that will be distributed either to half the ‚Äúclub‚Äù‚Ä¶ or to all of its members - depending on how they vote it. The instructor reveals the results (awarding a prize in crypto to every participant) and teaches basic concepts in cooperation and game theory. He tells the audience the workshop was sponsored by a ‚Äúclub‚Äù, too - NounsDAO - that collaborates online to do cool stuff in the real world. And incites attendees they can do the same via the club they now belong to.\n\n**d) Skate & Lunch:** to wrap things up, Bob Burnquist invites the kids for a ride on the Institute‚Äôs track, then **food and drinks** are served for all.\n\nWe plan to bring 30 kids in each workshop. The goal is to **introduce 120 people to crypto and NFTs** via Nouns DAO.\n\nThe end goal is to find a format ([presentation here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFHzoOmwAE/OhifeRzHPUSLD7X1YLORVQ/view?utm_content=DAFHzoOmwAE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishpresent)) that can be replicated in other communities in a cost-effective way.\n\n**The workshops will be conducted by guiriba, a member of Paradigma Education**. Paradigma is a crypto research house in Brazil with experience ranging from [materials for beginners](https://paradigma.docsend.com/view/vzysv4pg3evfqry9) to courses to [analysis for experts.](https://app.paradigma.education/feed/post/view?id=kru2M8m98ePrweKAjXeu)\n\n## 2) Nounify the skateboard track of Gigoia Island, Rio de Janeiro/RJ.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5iJAROf.png)\n\n***Left:** [Bob Burnquist at the skate park](https://oglobo.globo.com/rio/bairros/niteroi/noticia/2022/06/bob-burnquist-leva-projeto-social-para-o-caramujo-em-niteroi.ghtml). Right: the Brazilian version of Skater Noun was created by [Ozzz](https://twitter.com/ozzzmabro), member of the [Mafriends](https://twitter.com/MafriendsArt) collective.*\n\nWhile the workshop takes place, Nouns artwork by Brazilian artists will be painted at the Skate Cuida Institute, where classes are taught by Bob Burnquist.\nWe will bring a film crew and later deliver a clip registering the workshops and painting action.\n\n## 3) Make a donation to the Skate Cuida Institute.\n\nPurchase 3 VR headsets and 3 notebooks for the institute, to support the 4 weekly encounters currently held there, where kids receive cognitive training, skateboarding lessons, food and a safe space to play.\n\n### What is the Skate Cuida Institute and who is Bob Burnquist?\n\nBob Burnquist is the greatest X-Games winner in history.\n\nA Brazilian skateboarder & ex-videogame star, he now aims to empower unprivileged communities through sports, education and technology.\n\nSkate Cuida Institute is a place in Rio with modest infrastructure where Bob and his team receive dozens of youngsters a week to study and skate together.\n\nBob is also avowedly a crypto-native. In 2021, he launched his first NFT collection, [Burnquist Gold.](https://twitter.com/bobburnquist/status/1446965292836524039) A fan of the Tezos blockchain, Bob has also experimented with Ethereum.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5hWMyOY.png)\n\nSource: [Viva o Rio.](http://vivario.org.br/bob-burnquist-oferece-oficina-de-skate-no-parque-esportivo-e-social-do-caramujo/)\n\n### **What is the motivation for Nouns DAO to fund the proposal?**\n\n1) To foster web3 proficiency among teenagers from Rio de Janeiro communities.\n2) To bring Nouns culture to young people having their first contact with the world of NFTs.\n3) To seek media exposure in newspapers like O Globo, with [more than 25M readers and 185M monthly views](https://oglobo.globo.com/politica/o-globo-foi-jornal-mais-lido-do-pais-em-2021-25376960); and social media like that of Bob Burnquist, who has more than [160K followers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bobburnquist) and [770K on Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/bobburnquist/)\n4) Create a cc0 educational material for communities around the world, allowing anyone to translate it and use it to teach web3 to children using Nouns.\n\n### **How much will the action cost?**\n**1) 3.5 ETH for the web3 educational program at the Skate Cuida Institute.**\n \n- 1.2 ETH: airdrops for the attendees during the 4 workshops (120 x 0.01 ETH per person). The amount in ETH sent to the teens will be done via Polygon. A local business will be on the location, selling snacks and accepting crypto as payment.\n- 2.3 ETH: event expenses:\n\\t- 1 ETH for instructor‚Äôs transport and accommodation: will be 4 weeks traveling from Minas Gerais to Rio de Janeiro. He will travel to Rio de Janeiro every week, just to give the workshops.\n\\t- 1 ETH for to organize breakfast, lunch, and afternoon coffee for the teenagers to spend the day at the Skate Cuida Institute\n\\t- 0.3 ETH for the costs of printing QR Codes on the skateboard track.\n\\t- 0.7 ETH for to pay the instructor in charge of workshops.\n\n**2) 3 ETH for the artistic initiative.**\n\n- 1 ETH: The money will be used to pay Brazilian artists who will create Brazilian versions of the Nouns. 0.2 ETH will be paid to each of the chosen artists, making it possible to create 5 unique arts. One of them is already created.\n- 1 ETH: destined to purchase the materials used in the painting\n- 1 ETH: to the artist responsible for painting the Noun on the institute‚Äôs skate track. In each of the workshops he will be present, nounifying the skateboard track of the Skate Cuida Institute with the artists‚Äô designs.\n\n**3) Donation of 4 ETH to the Skate Cuida Institute.**\n- 1 ETH: for maintenance of the skateboard track at the Institute while the workshops are happening.\n- 3 ETH: equipment to encourage teenagers to [learn about web3:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDuKAded86Y)\n\\t- 3x AR Oculus Quest 2 (to introduce concepts of virtual worlds more easily and foster the creation of 3D art).\n\\t- 3x Notebook [Ideapad 3i:](https://www.kabum.com.br/produto/254192/notebook-lenovo-ultrafino-ideapad-3i-intel-core-i3-10110u-4gb-ssd-256gb-windows-11-15-6-prata-82bs000jbr?gclid=CjwKCAjwrNmWBhA4EiwAHbjEQI7OaPM7XOhSlqUKD_bRjiN5Pf-8Ty16Ulmszeq3mRP6yCQZvgTZWxoCft0QAvD_BwE) to allow the classes that already take place at the institute to handle more students per lesson.\n\n**4) 2 ETH for film crew to cover the workshop and further publicize the initiative.**\n\nTherefore, **we require 12.5 ETH** for the execution of all the actions listed above.\"",

WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?**\n___\nDesigned for maximum NOUNish-ness, these colorful 3‚Äù tall mini figures are meant to be a fun, low cost and non-crypto-based entry point into the world of ‚ÄúNOUNs.‚Äù Nounish Friends will be packed into colorful mystery boxes and presented in eye catching counter display cartons which are found in shops worldwide.\nProp 72 funded with 20ETH to take this project from initial idea, through countless iterations, to the current designs & prototypes. We have communicated updates weekly on the [Discord here](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/973957832015761428) and have had many conversations on [Discourse here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nounish-friends-nouns-town-collectible-figures-and-more-by-bigshottoyworks/967/42?page=3&fbclid=IwAR2b6AnS2-xKAbn0eja5dL0k1LCufZM4v_nT5NbJXzZ_ZWWb5FEo_PIxly8), gathering feedback from over 50 comments to arrive at the final designs we‚Äôre proposing today. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mJ5emSS.jpg)\n\n___\n**II. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT COSTS:**\n___\n**CURRENT STAGE:**\n - **Engineering:**  tooling masters, paint masks, production molds, Packaging, Final branding, box and display box design and dies: $45K ***(one time cost)***\n - **Manufacturing:** $53K for 10K pcs \n - **Logistics/warehousing:** $29K\n - **Marketing, project management & B2B & B2C sales:** $40K for 6 months. This involves sample photography,press, targeted social media engagement, onboarding  and follow ups, potential partner onboarding and communications. This includes unexpected sample creations and air shipping for events such as Art Basel, Dcon, NFTNYC and other opportunities world wide while the mass production run is being produced.\n - **TOTAL ASK:** $167K USD\n\n**PAYMENT SCHEDULE:**\nPayments to be broken down into 3 milestones as follows: \n - **35% upfront** ($58,450 USD)\nPreproduction deposit for further final development of graphics, packaging templates, tooling molds, paint molds, and final samples.\n - **35% on Milestone 1** ($58,450 USD)\nDeposit for mass production deposit once tooling test shots and painted counter sample approvals,\n - **30% on Milestone 2** (50,100 USD)\nFull balance paid out once production passes testing. QC inspection and is ready to ship to our warehouse by sea.\n\n**PAYMENT DETAILS**\n - **GNOSIS SAFE**\nETH will be sent to a 2/3 Gnosis Safe with the following signers:\nBigshot Klim - 0xd25912007EBC2527d4ED9DC536f928E550b0f02C\nJoshua Fisher - JoshuaFisher.eth\nJoel Cares - JoelCares.eth\n\n - **ETH -> USD CONVERSION**\nCalculations done on 9/14/2022 at $1,600 USD / ETH\nProject Cost = $167,000 USD = 104.38 ETH\nVolatility Buffer (10%) = 10.44 ETH\nTOTAL ASK = 114.82 ETH \n\n - **PROCEDURE**\n   - A 10% buffer was added to the ask to account for volatility in ETH prices prior to conversion.\n   - Upon recieving the funds Gnosis Safe operators will immediately convert ETH to USDC to cover total Project Cost. The USDC will be held in the safe and released to Bigshot Klim when Milestones are completed.\n   - If for any reason there are excess funds (ETH remaining  after conversion, milestones not hit) any unspent funds will be returned to Nouns DAO.\n   - If the value of ETH falls sufficiently before conversion and this value no longer covers project costs another proposal will be submitted to cover the difference. \n\n - **TRANSACTION**\ntransfer 114.82 ETH to 0xA04D191Ae755c442B5e4a0ea10136b7B0354cC6a\n\n___\n**III. FUTURE STEPS**\n___\n\nOur 10,000 physical toys will be utilized for both sales and giveaways for maximum reach and value. We believe that both are important aspect of this proof of concept model moving forward:\n\n - 10% -1,000 toys(100 sets) allocated to community members and other Nouns initiatives like Nouns OTG, Rose Bowl and Art Basel Miami etc. Final production Toys will be allocated and shipped from our warehouse (worldwide approx shipping/handling cost $35 per case of toys) \n - 9,000 units to be sold at SRP $14/toy, or approx $7 wholesale + shipping. Portion of the sales will be used to develop series 2 and put forth in a proposal if the project is a success. \n - Option for DAO allocated additional quantities from this edition at $7/unit \n - Option to re-order at lower unit cost ($5-6/unit) in a future run.\n - Option to create unique colorways & revised single-unit packaging at lower unit cost.\n - A collectible card with a POAP is included with each toy. Use TBD, but it will help with future engagement and retain customer attention.Collectors and fans could receive digital goodies, participate in games, contests or win prizes from our NOUNWORKS shop, and/or have access to unique experiences for POAP holders only. Goodies and prizes can be things in our shops or future items from the community based on the promotions and future partnerships and collaborations(TBD) based on Nounish partners and collaborations.\n\nIt is imperative that we expedite manufacturing so that we can have product ready for public introduction and review at Designercon in November 18-20 2022 (10X20 Booth booked), Art Basel in Miami in December, and possible availability for distribution at Rose Bowl (Jan 1, 2023) with Stoopid Buddy Studios. We can support global meet ups with products as well as some blank figures for local artists to paint.\n\n\n\nAll of the items ship from a central location in USA so the marketing and proliferation logistics are perfectly aligned. These steps, including ongoing press and social media support, are crucial to any project of this scope and everything has a price. Since we have multiple ongoing projects with NOUNs and plan many more, we want to be as efficient as possible with our time as well as resources.\nWe are excited to create and distribute the very best  Nouns toys! We have built out a model that is scalable for large-scale runs in the future after this concept is proven.\n",

      "content": "# Noun Sounds Proposal\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/AqMhNe3.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/746662212\n)\n\nWATCH VIDEO: https://vimeo.com/746662212\n\n## **TL;DR** \n\nNoun Sounds will provide a much needed audio-scape to the Nouns ecosystem.  SuperTightWoody and Papaya will create a platform and ingest processes where anyone can create, export and contribute CC0 Nounish songs, stems, samples, sounds effects and more.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/96a5gtJ.png)\n\n# The Problem\n\nThere is currently no Nouns audio aesthetic, and no environment for it to flourish. There are no sonic logos, sounds or songs that have a consistent use case in the Nouns world. Nounish creators of apps, videos, games and beyond have nowhere to turn for audio. \n\nNounish creators have to source their own audio, often out of their own pocket while being forced to manage limited use rights.\n\nAll of this makes brand consistency/recognition difficult and next to impossible. Sonic logos, sounds or songs are a core part of any brand.  \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VN0FNJY.png)\n\n\n# Our Solution\n\n**nounsounds.wtf**\n\nWe will create a robust website that will act as a hub for all things related to Nouns audio. This will include an easy to use music ‚ÄúPLAYground‚Äù to build a unique Nouns song for your project, a repository of samples/sounds/songs and a robust roadmap with processes and structure, allowing our environment to grow.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UevPiIZ.png)\n\n---\n\n# The User Experience\n\n## **Homepage**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Z53wdaT.png)\n\nOn the homepage, the latest Noun Sound will be displayed along with the Noun it generates!  **This, and all Noun Sounds, will be available for free use and CC0**.\n\n How does it generate this Noun Sound you might ask?  Let‚Äôs head over to the‚Ä¶\n\n## **PLAYground**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pwDMdY5.png)\n\nThe visual Noun will be generated via the PLAYground tab.  \n\nIn this area, a song is split into its different tracks. Here, one of the 10 songs created for Nouns will be selected.  Each song will contain 5 variations per instrument. Each instrument will correspond to a Nouns layer whose assets will be randomly generated when the page loads. \n\nRefreshing the page or hitting the ‚ÄúRandomize‚Äù button will randomly select a new SONG and new set of LAYERS.  Every time you create a new Nouns Sound, a unique new Noun will be born to accompany it!\n\nPut together your favorite song tracks for your project and‚Ä¶VOILA!  You now have your own unique Noun Sound.\n\n[![](https://i.imgur.com/kAFMtLi.png)\n](https://vimeo.com/738442849/e3cdaf3d87)\nWATCH VIDEO: https://vimeo.com/738442849/e3cdaf3d87\n\n## **Sounds**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9DU37V1.png)\n\nIf you want to grab any of the full songs, stems, loops, samples or sound effects by themselves- this is the place to go.  Easily filter these via metadata and get to creating your Nounish multimedia! \n\n# How Does This Proliferate Nouns?\n\n***Sound*** is the backbone of any cohesive brand and multimedia creation.  This CC0 resource will assist in the production of music, apps, games, videos, social content, sonic branding and more- all revolving around Nouns.  As we work along side Nouns DAO in the future, a self sustaining library of high quality audio will fill a void for creators across all mediums of creative content. \n\n# The Team\n\nWith 20+ years of music production and engineering experience, **SuperTightWoody** is a Grammy Nominated music producer.  Having works featured on major label albums, TV shows, movie trailers and television commercials.  In the Nouns space, he has created the theme song for the Nouncil along with theme songs for The Noun Square Twitter spaces (and the ‚Äúsoundboard‚Äù for TNS).  As a Nouncil and TNS member- he is very much looking forward to expanding his contributions into the Nouns space.\n\n**Papaya** is a software engineer with 15+ years of experience known for his attention to detail. He has worked on numerous NFT Collections, tools and Defi protocols. He loves building unique experiences for web3 communities and developers. \n\n# Timeline\n\nThe creation of everything laid out in this first proposal will take 3 months to complete from proposal approval.\n\n# Proposed Funding\n\n72ETH for deliverables + timeline. \n*Signers will be SuperTightWoody and Papaya for multisig wallet 0xE8cF782Bb4aCB9000fae76bA940295CA988DE7Be*\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables\n\n**This Proposal: First Audio Library + Infrastructure**  \n\nOur first proposal is to create the first Nounish audio library, a website, an easy-to-use tool for builders to create songs, and laying out the workflows for onboarding new music makers into the system processes.\n\n- *A fully functional Noun Sounds website with user friendly audio interfaces*\n- *10 CC0 Noun Sounds songs (+ 5 variations of each instrument for the PLAYground)*\n- *3 Nouns sonic logo stings*\n- *20 bleeps, bloops, swooshes and more for apps and games*\n- *All songs, stems and individual samples page available for download*\n- *Twitter account and Discord for building the Noun Sounds community*\n\n---\n\n**Next Proposal: New Tools + Bring on other musicians**\n\nOnce this infrastructure has been built and our ingestion flow for new audio is set, it‚Äôs time to grow independently.\n\n- *Create Noun Sounds DAO*\n- *Start developing system to Fund DAO through the sales of generated Noun Sounds NFTs.*\n- *Create pipeline for onboarding new musicians via sounds submissions + legal processes*\n- *Create professional VST instruments that music makers can use in the DAW of their choice, to create an audio palette that allows total freedom while keeping brand cohesion*\n- *Explore the use of AI and other technologies to push the envelope of what is possible*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/etJbiGT.png)\n\n## Additional Links:\n\nwww.supertight.co\n\nwww.soundcloud.com/supertightwoody\n\nwww.soundcloud.com/nounspoap\n\n## Proposed Transactions:\n\n1. 0xE8cF782Bb4aCB9000fae76bA940295CA988DE7Be.transfer(\n‚ÄÉ72 ETH\n)\n",

      "content": "# Nouns X Internet Game: Season 2 w/ gmoney\n\n**Dear NounsDAO,**\n\nI‚Äôm a *huge* fans of Nouns. A big part of my Solidity education was forking the Nouns contract back when we were at Noun #3. So I‚Äôm super thrilled to present an idea that integrates Nouns into what I've been working on for 2 years, & can contribute to the Nounish goal of spreading the Nouns meme far & wide.\n\n----\n\n**TLDR:** We are Internet Game. We host massive web3 game shows with thousands of players and blue-chip NFT prizes. Our Season 2 is coming up next, hosted by gmoney, and we‚Äôd like to re-skin one of the games to feature Nouns, as well as educate our players about Nouns with a video prior to the game.\n\nBefore we get into specifics, we‚Äôll share a bit more about who we are and why we‚Äôre qualified to propose this‚Ä¶\n\n## What is Internet Game??\n\n[Internet Game](https://internet.game/) is Squid Game meets NFTs. We create live, interactive game shows that anyone can play at home with hyper-simple, yet dangerously fun mini-games. 60% of buy-ins go to blue-chip NFT prizes, all voted on by the community in Discord.\n\nIn March 2022 we launched our Internet Game: [Season 1](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ut4uEdKyydQ3lFZFoGIMUWpsqXQh_ZE3NugP6UGIE-c/edit#slide=id.g13ad4d9e874_0_0). 8000 players minted $2.2M in NFTs to play. We then purchased $1M+ in NFT prizes as voted on by the players, including Bored Apes, Mutant Apes, Doodles, Azukis, CloneX and many more.\n\nThe best way to fully understand how our seasons work is to[ look at this case study](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ut4uEdKyydQ3lFZFoGIMUWpsqXQh_ZE3NugP6UGIE-c/edit#slide=id.p).\n\nInternet Game: Season 2 ‚ÄúBear Market Battle‚Äù launches on September 12th. Season 2 features 6 brand new games taking place between September 12th and 23rd. The entire event is hosted by the infamous gmoney & comedian Leah Lamarr. Gmoney will appear as a full 3D version of his cryptopunk by being rigged up in a high-fidelity motion capture suit, and will then be superimposed on an XR stage (picture a gigantic LED screen & floor) next to Leah.\n\n## Season 2 Trailer:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lr3GruECkk\n\nHere‚Äôs a preview of what that looks like from the podcast we did with gmoney on the XR stage with him in the co-cap suit:\n\n![|624x323](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/R2_yJv7VgaZlSyENj-pB3qwG82IdRuM9S1i94XuvPAeTjmR2gD5Hnqiz-vE7NWVMMAFtEY4ZTSFat4h1jg9DTlxnubOXHtnfWIhRnJIAmcmypoVrmrmuGvGc5RIU2Hw-z3xxbllb31NhvAAY-eXIk8w)\n\n## The Opportunity: Nouns Game + Video in Season 2\n\nInternet Game Season 2 is made up of 6 mini-games that take place over the course of two weeks. Each game runs for 24 hours.\n\nThere is an opportunity to fully brand the third game, currently titled as ‚ÄúThe Last Spaceship‚Äù, and transform it into ‚ÄúThe Last Noun‚Äù.\n\nThe game itself is similar to an old school Asteroids / Galaga space shooter, but with an original take on how you move around the space. We think the 2D arcade aesthetic is a perfect match for the Nouns art. Both the main character as well as the enemies would be Nouns:\n\n## The Opportunity: Nouns Game + Video in Season 2\n\nInternet Game Season 2 is made up of 6 mini-games that take place over the course of two weeks.

If desired, we could include a trailer / explainer / hype video for Nouns in that video. This would need to be provided by Nouns DAO.\n\n**Additional opportunities during Season 2:**\n\n* Including Nouns and/or Lil Nouns in our prize pool\n* Skinning the entire Internet Game tournament page during ‚ÄúThe Last Noun‚Äù game to be Nouns-branded\n* Upon the launch of the game, post a write up on our social platforms (Twitter/Discord) to educate our audience on Nouns DAO and the Nouns mission & mechanics\n\n## Our Ask:\n\n**ETH Sponsorship:** Nouns DAO would contribute 20 ETH to Internet Game Season 2. The sponsorship would be split to further contribute to the prize pool and cover operational expenditures incurred by Internet Game.\n\n## Proposed Timeline & Next Steps\n\n* Engage in discussions to answer any questions derived from this proposal\n* Gain approval to transform ‚ÄúThe Last Spaceship‚Äù into ‚ÄúThe Last Noun‚Äù\n* Announce partnership with Nouns DAO for Season 2 including the donation to the prize pool\n* Complete redesign of the tournament page and game and showcase to Nouns DAO for feedback\n* Launch ‚ÄúThe Last Noun‚Äù Game on September 16th, along with the optional pre-game video\n\n## Long-Term Opportunity: Nouns Custom Casual Game\n\nWe we would love to continue the relationship and build a fully custom game for Nouns that can live on in perpetuity. The game would be co-created by the DAO and Internet Game to provide a unique experience that allows consumers to connect with the Nouns brand in an interactive way. Casual gaming is a juggernaut of an industry due to its accessibility (ease of learning), low effort requirement, and repeat value (easy to hop in and out of) it provides. We see a Nouns Game as a way to engage the general population in a highly scalable and interactive way all around the world. Details on this longer-term partnership opportunity can be submitted through a separate proposal.\n\n---\n\n*Thank you for reading! We'll be excitedly watching the voting.*",

We seek to impact various causes by addressing problems that affect our society. Mucho Love aims to cultivate a community in which all members feel part of something bigger than themselves, making them feel nounish.\n\n### How does Mucho Love work?\n\nMucho Love was created by 5 founders, who wear many hats and structured what it is today. We plan to expand the team next year to escalate further and establish more specific scopes. Currently, we have over 30 community members eager to volunteer for the causes we are aiding.\n\nMucho Love currently works on a 9-step system.\n\n1. **Ideation:** planning and deciding on activities.\n2. **Outreach:** contacting the organizations/places, writing letters/petitions, and setting up dates/places.\n3. **Chronogram/Requirements:** Itinerary, step-by-step program to be performed on events, pre-event checklist, proofreading.\n4. **Quotations:** quotation of each item or service (3 quotations from different companies per item or service)\n5. **Payments and Negotiations:** negotiating with businesses, establishing formal relationships, explaining MUCHO LOVE, and paying for services/items.\n6. **Pre-Event:** revision of the pre-event checklist, volunteer count, and Zoom meetings with volunteers and multimedia team to prepare for the event.\n7. **Event Day:** role call, transportation to the event, itinerary execution, feedback.\n8. **Post Event:** post-event multimedia management and feedback from participants.\n9. **Documentation:** establishing the framework to replicate the current working system by documenting for the continuous improvement of the project.\n\n### How does this benefit the DAO?\n\n**Charity** is a recurrent activity/topic within the Nounish ecosystem‚Äîthat‚Äôs why we decided to start a nounish volunteering community that makes sure to proliferate Nouns with the values and vision it represents. **Mucho Love aims to become one of the Nounish platforms regarding community service, social work, and volunteering campaigns.** Mucho Love‚Äôs activities will all be shared through Twitter and Instagram, appealing to the masses and expanding global Noggle adoption.\n\nMucho Love is starting operations in the Dominican Republic but aims to develop a model that is replicable internationally. Also, if needed, we want to be able to travel to any part of the world to aid any team who needs help developing charitable efforts in their respective communities. \n\n### Goals\n\nOur goal is to **establish the foundation of Mucho Love as a future Decentralized Non-Profit Organization** **that will allow us to replicate the model in any part of the world.** The structure/model created will be available for any team that wants to make charitable efforts in their respective communities. We also want to keep collaborating with established Nounish projects (like BigShotKlim‚Äôs pins and Messhup‚Äôs books) that can contribute with donations to proliferate Nouns further.\n\nMucho Love will carry out during the 4-month extension events/donations/activities among the following:\n\n* Hospital Robert Ried\n* Hospital Hugo Mendoza\n* Red Misericordia (Orphanage)\n* Hogar Escuela Santo Domingo Savio (Orphanage/School)\n* Escuelita Caf√© con Leche (Orphanage/School)\n\n*2 institutions have not given a definitive yes; therefore, they are subject to change.\n\n### Pilot results\n\nThe pilot successfully helped children feel joy despite going through difficult moments. We also showed what the Noggles are and what they can do. People fell in love with Messhup‚Äôs books and BigShotKlim‚Äôs Noggle pins. Children that used glasses felt even more identified with the Noggles. I can genuinely say that the pilot was a success; the Noggles were well received, and we helped out 300 children and their parents while proliferating Nouns, love, and optimism.\n\n300 Children received 300 Nounish goodie bags containing:\n\n* Messhup‚Äôs coloring book (300 total)\n* Crayola box (300 total)\n* Diapers (1440 total)\n* Stickers (600 total)\n* BigShotKlim‚Äôs Noggle Pins (100 total)\n\nVideo recap:\n\n\n#### [MUCHO LOVE ](https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1565689757740535808)\n\n[@mucholovedr](https://twitter.com/mucholovedr/status/1565689757740535808)\n\nSpreading ‚ù§Ô∏è with ‚åê‚óß-‚óß *‚åê‚óß-‚óß are used to protect children‚Äôs identity https://t.co/PWvO4nhZYA\n\n### Budget\n\n24 ETH to be distributed in the following way:\n\n* 19 ETH for donations\n* 3 ETH for photo/video crew\n* 1 ETH for t-shirts and hats for volunteers to use during the events\n* 1 ETH for a storage facility\n\n*The team has not received any compensation, nor is it interested in getting compensation until we go on-chain again by the end of the year.\n\n*If any Nounish Project creator wants to collaborate with their products/ideas feel free to reach out to me.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FGPF9af.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "# Founding Partners of NFT Seattle\n\n(*TLDR, NFT Seattle is the first large scale Web3 event in the entire Pacific Northwest. We think it would be pretty sweet if the Nouns came in as title sponsors of this inaugural event*)\n\n### **DESCRIPTION**\n\n- Becoming the Nounding Partners / Presenting Sponsors of NFT Seattle creates an opportunity for the Nouns to build relationships with the Pacific Northwest‚Äôs Web3 community and solidify the Noun meme in the foundation of these new relationships.\n- As we establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation, we'd love for the Nouns to come in at the ground level and cement the meme as an integral part of Seattle‚Äôs Web3 ecosystem, positioned for maximum and lasting brand exposure. The Web3 community is still growing in Seattle so the probability of reaching new people (vs people that already know about the Nouns) is likely higher here, than most other major US cities. Plus Seattle's technically inclined demographic lends itself well to everything the Nouns stand for, though people here are still warming up to the whole idea of NFT's.\n\n### **WHAT IS NFT SEATTLE**\n\n- NFT Seattle is the first event catering to the broader Web3 community in the Pacific Northwest (Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, BC).\n- The vision behind NFT Seattle is to establish Seattle as a hub for Web3 innovation & connect the growing community in the Northwest. We want to unite people in Seattle to educate & expose them to the opportunities & possibilities that Web3 brings to creators, businesses, artists, and communities.\n- This event is mainly targeting the Web3 curious and as such, has a heavier leaning towards education.\n- NFT Seattle will take place from 9/30/2022 - 10/1/2022 in Seattle at several venues including Block 41 and the Seattle NFT Museum (the worlds first NFT Museum).\n\n### **WHY SHOULD NOUNS BE INVOLVED & WHY IT MATTERS?**\n\n- NFT Seattle presents a unique opportunity for the Nouns to proliferate the Nouns meme and imagery (think, Noggles in downtown Seattle) across a region that is still trying to figure out Web3 but is on the cusp of a major Web3 breakout. A region that has already cemented itself as a global hub for technological and cultural innovation, with everything from Amazon/Microsoft to Starbucks and many more having been birthed here.\n- As the first Web3 event in the Pacific Northwest, NFT Seattle will draw people in from Portland, Seattle, Vancouver BC and will lean heavily towards education plus fostering deep, meaningful connection between brands, thought leaders and other attendees. Early data suggests the audience will be a healthy mix between the Web3 curious, and those that are pioneering in the space.\n- This event also creates a perfect opportunity for an IRL Noun meetup, for Nouns that are local to the region to come and engage with the local community while providing *Nouns on the Ground* an opportunity to execute their existing IRL events strategy, in a new untapped market. Also, hoping to partner with the Nounish marketing team to up-level the Nounishness of this activation if the prop passes. (Initial conversations have been started).\n\n### **THE BREAKDOWN**\n\n- **Presenting Title Sponsor of NFT Seattle** (‚ÄùNFT Seattle presented by the Nouns‚Äù). Nouns branding will be prominently featured at the Event and the official After Party.\n    \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/jDWDkc8.png)\n\n\n    \n- **Live Art Premier** that is nouns-inspired and incorporates the noggles, showcased by local high profile NFT artist [Jaiden ‚ÄòJasti‚Äô Stipp](https://www.instagram.com/jastidesigns/), the 16yr old that made over a million selling NFT's.\n- As a way of thanking the Nouns for being a founding event partner for NFT Seattle, this commemorative art-piece will become a permanent fixture at every NFT Seattle annual event, an exclusive benefit only being extended to the Nouns. We‚Äôll store this piece for future use, or the Nouns can opt to claim it for use at other IRL events.\n- **Evergreen Video Content** to drive meme awareness and exposure: 2 daily sizzle Reels to be shared upon completion of each event day specifically highlighting the Nouns, and 1 sizzle Reel showcasing the creation of the custom mural. Video content to be produced by local media partner Brandtegic.\n- **Nouns Branding exclusively featured on each String Backpack** provided to all attendees upon entry. Nouns stickers and swag will also be included in each swag bag (we'd need help designing the stickers).\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/poa1pxT.jpg)\n\n\n    \n- **Nouns Branding prominently featured on Social, Website, and Emails** that will be widely visible to all attendees, the public, and reviewed by various news outlets and media partners. We just recently kicked off a regional PR campaign, the Nouns imagery will be added to the the forefront of all marketing materials associated with the event as a title sponsor.\n\n- **Fireside chat with a Noun**, an optional speaking opportunity where a designated Noun can share a bit about how the Nouns continue to play a key role in the advancement of the overall DAO ecosystem via the prop house model or a deep dive into cc0 NFT's, using Nouns as a use-case.\n\n\n### **THE ASK**\n\nThis is a title sponsorship for NFT Seattle, and cost breakdown will be as follows:\n\n- $65,000 USD ~ 40 ETH (calculated at 1 ETH = $1,600)\n    - 10 ETH - Towards venue costs + event production team (labor)\n    - 16 ETH - Towards A/V production + other venue related expenses\n    - 10 ETH - Towards PR campaign, advertising, event marketing, videographers and video editing. (This includes printing graphics for all Nouns signage and marketing materials)\n    - 4 ETH - Live painted Nouns inspired mural/art piece by Jasti (reusable at future events)\n    \n    ***N.B.** This cost also factors in event admission for Nouns that wish to attend (up until a pre-negotiated number) as well as an optional booth activation, if there are nouns on the ground available to man it.*\n    \n\n### **WHY SEATTLE**\n\n- Seattle is an emerging market in Web3 with events just starting to take place. (ETHSeattle, blockchain events, and now NFT Seattle)\n- Starbucks is entering Web3 and launching an NFT collection ([CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/05/04/starbucks-teases-web-3-platform-in-nft-announcement/)) and it‚Äôs in good company among other major brands with a substantial presence in Washington who are either ALL-IN or dabbling in Web3- Salesforce, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple.\n- Besides SF, Seattle has more tech talent than any other city in the country ([425 Business](https://www.425business.com/news/greater-seattle-no-2-in-tech-talent-report/article_37815015-8e5d-58f2-81fa-593715c7f695.html)) and it‚Äôs also the country‚Äôs most desired location for people aged 18 to 24 ([Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/cost-of-living/seattle-wa/)), making the city an ideal place for Web3 brands to establish a presence in order to attract and retain top talent.\n- 75% or more of PNW Angel Investors are interested in Web3 companies and founders. ([Madrona Venture Group](https://www.madrona.com/angel-investors-pacific-northwest-directory/))\n- Seattle is the US‚Äô primary gateway to Asia, the best city in America for outdoor activities, the 13th best city to live in overall, and the eighth-best city for raising a family. ([Patch.com](https://patch.com/washington/seattle/seattle-ranks-high-2022-best-places-live-list))\n- There is a growing list of startups in Seattle building crypto, blockchain, and Web3 technologies such as Irreverent Labs, CoinMe, Nori, ArcBlock, Bittrex, CypherD, DragonChain, Luxor (Source: [GeekWire](https://www.geekwire.com/2022/a-list-of-startups-in-seattle-building-crypto-blockchain-and-web3-technologies/))\n\n### **THE TEAM BEHIND THE PROPOSAL**\n\nWe‚Äôre a team of builders from diverse cultures and backgrounds, united by the goal of advancing the adoption of Web3 technologies.\n\n- **Tessa Mero** ([@tesssamero](https://twitter.com/tessamero)) - VP of Developer Relations at Appwrite, over a decade of experience organizing events. She recently co-organized the [ReFiSummit](https://refisummit.org/) event.\n- **Mark Robinson** ([@markarobinson_](https://twitter.com/markarobinson_)) - Partner at [Brandtegic](https://www.brandtegic.co/), a creative content agency, and the host of the ‚ÄòMarketing in the Metaverse‚Äô podcast.\n- **Lennox Matsinde** ([@lennoxtakura](https://twitter.com/lennoxtakura)) - Product Management at Starbucks Corporate, Founder of Satoshi‚Äôs Index NFT (a token gated SaaS Platform) and Founder of Inyasha Capital (Seattle based Quant Fund).\n- **EXP Events** - Local Event Planning, Coordination, & Production Company and the production partner for Alaska Airlines, Microsoft, President Joe Biden, World Relief.\n- **The Seattle NFT Museum** ([@seanftmuseum](https://twitter.com/seanftmuseum)) - The world‚Äôs first NFT Museum highlighting everything from educational exhibits to coveted 1-of-1 pieces, and hosting consistent live community events.

      "content": "# Xanadu x Nouns: Mega Episode + Real-time Nouns World Toolkit\n\nDear NounsDAO,\n\nWelcome to Xanadu‚Ä¶ a story world made by one dude with godlike creation powers forging a new category of entertainment that twists fiction with reality and collides pop culture with the coolest things on the internet. It‚Äôs a wild, novel genre that‚Äôs inspiring a new generation of creators, artists, and storytellers. \n\n### Click image to watch Blu present the proposal\n[![Image alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ktZaS52qyYA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktZaS52qyYA) \n\nWe‚Äôre a team of two with a shared passion for bringing avatars and worlds to life. We want to help bring Nouns into the 3D metaverse with our unique storytelling and world-building skills. We propose a XANADU x NOUNS collaboration consisting of two parts:\n\n### Part One - Nouns Episode of Xanadu \nWe would create a mega-episode of Xanadu where Blu, the hero of Xanadu, teams up with Nouns in an action-packed deep dive into the Nouns Universe.\n\nThe episode features Blu questing through Planet Nouns desperate for the Nouns help to save him from a posse of intergalactic gangsters. To satisfy the bounty on his head, Blu must submit a winning proposal to Nouns DAO which kicks off a wild escapade through the Nouns City Center, the historic Nouner Capitol building, and the Nouns Underground. Along the way, Blu meets a master Noun who gives him a crash course on NounsDAO, how it works and why it‚Äôs awesome ‚Äî education disguised as Hollywood quality entertainment. But it doesn‚Äôt stop there‚Ä¶\n\n![Alt Text](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/e/e4951cf151fd7bfb2f983a7dbcb7ed901ce5614d.gif)\n\n### Part Two - CC0 Nouns Toolkit\nUnlike a Hollywood feature where all the creativity and work vanish after the movie‚Äôs made, all of the Nouns assets created for this episode will be crafted into a Nouns World Toolkit that will live on in an innovative and powerful new way ‚Äî in the hands of the community, available CC0.\nThis is more than a simple library of assets‚Ä¶\n\nBecause Xanadu is built in a game engine (Unreal Engine 5), it‚Äôs a story world that can be cinematic, interactive, gamified, live-streamed, or experienced in VR. So, armed with this massive toolkit of AAA animatable Nouns characters & pre-lit, animated environments ‚Äî complete with how-to guide books & tutorials created by us ‚Äî the Nouns community can inhabit a Noun for VTubing, Zoom calls, or create cinematic content, marketing materials, NFTs, or even build a Nouns VR experience, game, or metaverse. It‚Äôs our hope for this to become the beginning of a dynamic Nouns repository that grows over time and is contributed to by other builders. (Full list of Toolkit deliverables below in Extra Details)\n\n![Alt Text](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/1/137fa14e33c6b60152c5c4700e5f77bb82b719f1.gif)\n\n### How does this benefit NounsDAO?\n- **The Episode** ‚Äî Exposure for NounsDAO in a novel, powerful narrative ‚Äì with analytics & insights (average results per episode: 2.7M impressions, 321K views, 12K watch-time hours)\n- **The Toolkit** ‚Äî 3D tools that enables Nouns creators, creations, remixes with other IPs, and continued proliferation of Nouns to a new degree.\n- **Our Vision** ‚Äî Inspire creators with the episode, enable creations with the toolkit, and catalyze a cohort of Nouns as VTubers and next-generation virtual avatars.\n\n### Community \nWorking directly with the Nouns community is key for this project in several ways:\n1. **Help choose what Nouns derivatives to feature** such as LilNouns, SharkDAO, skateboards from GnarsDAO, and art pieces from prop house. We love the extended Nouns community want to infuse this thriving ecosystem into the Toolkit and Episode.\n2. **Help define the 3D style of the Nouns characters and environments**, as well as how Nouns express themselves using motion capture and animation.\n3. **Help choose Nouns characters to be featured in the episode.** Some Nouns will be chosen for story purposes but we‚Äôd love the community to vote on what other Nouns get featured. Those Nouns holders will have the option to voice & motion capture their own Noun (assuming there‚Äôs dialogue).\n\n### The General Timeline\n* Phase 1: **Concept & Design + Episode Writing.** starts immediately (est 2 months)\n* Phase 2: **Asset creation.** Starts as concepts complete (est 2-3 months) Will overlap with Phase 1\n* Phase 3: **Launch Beta Repository.** Nov 2022 Assets are made available as they are created.\n* Phase 4: **Episode Production Starts** Jan 2023 *When assets are finished (est 3 months)\nEst Episode completion March 2023\n\n### Toolkit Repository Timeline\n* Phase 1: **Launch Beta Repository.** Nov 2022 Post assets as they become available\n* Phase 2: **Create Beta How to Docs & Tutorials.** (these will roll out starting in Dec thru March)\n* Phase 3: **Launch final Toolkit Repository.** March 2023\nWe will be sharing fun BTS & asset creation along the way via YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and Instagram content.\n\n### Our Ask & Budget Breakdown \nWe are asking for a total of $307.2K USD (192E @ $1600)\n* Toolkit Concept Art & Design ‚Äî $20,480 (12.8ETH)\n* Toolkit 3D Modeling & Texturing ‚Äî $99,040 (61.9ETH)\n* Nouns Character Modeling & Rigging ‚Äî $33,440 (20.9ETH)\n* Toolkit Assembly & Episode Production ‚Äî $141,280 (88.3ETH)\n* Toolkit publishing & maintenance ‚Äî $12,960 (8.1ETH)\n\nThe proposed budget + 15% to cover volatility will be converted to USDC immediately, and everything in excess will be retrurned to the DAO. If, due to high volatility, there is insufficient ETH to cover the proposed budget (307.2K USD), a second proposal will be made.\n* Total: 192ETH * 1.15 = 220.8ETH\n\n---\n\n## Extra Details\n\n### The Nouns World Toolkit Repository \nThe CCO repository will consist of the cast of Nouns characters and environments made for the episode. Everything will be set up in the Unreal Engine (Free game engine software) and we're going to include all the scenes, cameras, lighting and animation from the episode which means, the Nouns City center will be alive with ambient animation and amazing cinematic lighting.  Additionally, the scenes from the episode will provide a starting point for making new content that looks amazing. All the Nouns characters will be rigged and ready for motion capture style animation (Both face and body similar to how Blu is setup in Xanadu).  For those with the right gear, this means you can instantly puppet any of those Nouns for V-Tubbing or creating your own cinematic content.  We're also exploring 'off the shelf' webcam mocap solutions (Cheap or free but body motion quality not as good as the expensive mocap suites) to include, if possible, to make inhabiting the nouns characters more accessible.  This would also allow using Nouns for Zoom calls, etc. \n\n### Nouns World Toolkit Details\n* 12 Hero Nouns (Face & Body fully rigged for motion capture)\n* 24 Secondary Nouns (Body fully rigged for motion capture. Minimal to no facial animation)\n* Beautifully lit and fully animated environments:\n* Nouns Downtown City Center (exterior, like Time Square)\n        * Buildings reflecting the Nouns extended family\n* Nouner Capitol Building (Exterior & Interior) \n* Nouns underground city / town (Exterior)\n* Noun masters Dojo (Exterior & Interior)\n* General modular city assets *for building new structures\n* General nounish props & furniture \n* Nouns transport vehicles\n* Wide Establishing model of the Nouns Planet\n* Guide Book & Tutorials on using the Toolkit to create Vtuber & Cinematic content \n\n### Technical Details\n* Unreal Engine 5 project - CC0\n* Assets performant in Real-time (Streaming)\n* Assets performant in VR\n* Fully animated Hero scenes from episode included as examples\n        * All hero Nouns characters ready for motion capture (Face and Body)\n\n### Production Team\n* Art Direction, Episode Writing & Directing\n* Producer\n* Lighting\n* Motion Capture\n* Animation\n* Cinematography\n* UE4 Integration & Tooling\n* VFX\n* Actors\n* Editing\n* Music\n* Sound Design\n\n### Episode Details\n* 20-30 minutes\n\n### About Xanadu & beyond\nThe heart of Xanadu is its zany stories and wild characters, but its soul burns to bridge and play in other universes. Thus Blu wants to help bring to life the budding spectrum of web3 Pop-Cultures from Nouns, cloneX and BAYC to small burgeoning Avatar projects backed by talented teams or individuals. All so they can collide on a bigger, more wild stage, with bigger, more wild crossover stories! Think Ready Player One and the Marvel Universe but creator content style!\n\n### FUN BONUS IDEA: Wild Story Twist!\nBlu‚Äôs adventure with the Nouns will live on beyond this episode in a ‚Äòfirst-of-its-kind‚Äô melding of entertainment & reality; After this episode airs, Blu‚Äôs fictional proposal (The one he formulates in the episode with help from the Nouns) is actually a real proposal that he submits to the Nouns DAO‚Ä¶ and the outcome of that proposal dictates Blu‚Äôs future storyline ‚Äì Will his proposal be good enough for approval, or will Blu have to evade the gangsters and find another solution to survive?\n\nIf you haven‚Äôt seen Xanadu yet, check it out [Xanadu on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/xanaduBlu) and our original proposal teaser.\n[![Image alt text](https://img.youtube.com/vi/xJTpIGK3tUc/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/xJTpIGK3tUc) \n\nThank you,\nCory & Stephen",

Additionally, some of the most active Nouns contributors got their start in SharkDAO.\n\nSuccessful proposals:\n\n-   Prop 8 - FOMO Nouns\n-   Prop 12 - Perpetual Glasses to Kids In Need V2\n-   Prop 20 - Nouns Stories\n-   Prop 56 - FUN Noggles Stage 2\n-   Prop 68 - Nouns Esports\n-   Prop 70 - Nouns CC0 Story Foundations & Development\n-   Prop 104 - Free Glasses for Kids v4\n-   Prop 116 - Monthly Nouns Comic\n\nThe time has come to raise our contributor game to the next level by deploying Shark Labs, an open creative laboratory and incubator focused on supporting Nounish creatives in developing and submitting deliverables to Nouns on a regular basis, led by core SharkDAO contributors.\n\n# What is Shark Labs?\n\nShark Labs is a cohort of SharkDAO contributors that are actively working to support, develop, and ship Nounish projects. SharkLabs will operate under 3 main outlets to achieve our goals:\n\n-   **Art**\n-   **Development**\n-   **Media**\n\nSharkDAO has a unique identity as a more accessible avenue for participation in the Nouns ecosystem. We attract many builders, artists, and creatives, with more to come as a result of our upcoming PFP project. The mission of Shark Labs is to implement a structure in which we can more efficiently utilize and support contributors in deploying projects that add value to Nouns with a regular cadence.\n\n----------\n\n![_15.png](https://snapshot.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/bafkreibexnxvx74cecnj2mgfwnl7zqg2x7trkxbpvxv3he3rcu3evcj4za)\n\n_Excerpt from the Shark Street Comic #2, by Maty_\n\n----------\n\n# Outlet Details\n\n-   **Art Reef:**  Art Reef: An art laboratory supporting emerging and established nounish creatives in addding content to Nouns lore and creating cc0 art for both SharkDAO & Nouns DAO. For this period, the Art Reef is interested in offering grants for projects that add background stories and personality to Nouns characters.\n    \n-   **Builders Bay:**  Advise and support the planning, development, and implementation of open source software projects that are focused on adding value to the SharkDAO/ NounsDAO ecosystem. For this funding period, the Development outlet will operate with an emphasis on attracting more builders to the Nouns ecosystem, funding and advising projects that seek to create efficiencies in coordination and collaboration amongst Sharks & Nouners, as well as tools that streamline processes for evaluating and awarding project grants and retroactive funding.\n    \n-   **Media Cove:**  Oversee the production of various media efforts designed to promote and educate those interested in the SharkDAO/ NounsDAO ecosystem, keep Sharks and Nouners informed about the latest initiatives, and perpetuate the Nounish culture through appropriate mediums. In this cycle, the Media Cove is focused on producing calculated 'outward facing' content that is designed to draw newcomers to the Nouns ecosystem.\n    \n\n# Operational Structure\n\n-   If passed, the funds from this proposal will be equally split (33 ETH each) between the 3 outlets. For transparency and efficiency, 5 signers will be nominated to sit on a dedicated multisig.\n-   Each outlet will be managed by a trusted SharkDAO contributor. The outlet managers will be responsible for keeping projects on track, providing updates to NounsDAO, and organizing the election of committee members and multi-sig signers.\n    -   Art Reef ‚Äî Marxistmillionaire\n    -   Builders Bay ‚Äî Nick Dodson\n    -   Media Cove ‚Äî Cryptasha\n-   DAO members submit project ideas to the outlets for a committee of fellow contributors to deliberate and advise. Project funds are released following a review by the committee members.\n    -   Committee members (subject to change)\n        -   Chris Carella\n        -   Cryptasha\n        -   Marxistmillionaire\n        -   Sasquatch\n        -   Joshua Fisher\n        -   Yungweez\n        -   Nick Dodson\n-   Bi-weekly Shark Labs updates will be posted in the Nouns discord.\n\n# Expected Deliverables\n\nWhile many deliverables will result from projects and ideas which will be surfaced as a result of Shark Labs, here is what Nouners can definitively expect to be shipped during this period.\n\n-   **Art Reef**\n    \n    -   Shark Street Comic (issues #3 to #5)\n        -   SharkDAO‚Äôs very own comic series, telling the backstories of our six Nouns.

      "content": "# Nouns x Dopamine\n\n# Nouns x Dopamine\n\n*tl:dr: Dopamine & Apenoun propose to collaborate on a Nounish ‚ÄúNon-Fungible Streetwear‚Äù drop to be premiered in a Nouns‚Äô exhibition room at Dopamine‚Äôs Art Basel Miami launch party.*\n\n*The drop will include ~500 cut-and-sew garments (including t-shirts, hoodies, and more) with cryptographic NFC microchips embedded under Nouns clothing patches, each connected via an on-chain ENS-like chip registry to a Nouns-branded NFT. A white-labeled Nouns browser app will be used for scanning the patch to claim the NFT, as well as for authenticating and verifying the garment owner and manufacturer.* \n\n*Dopamine, as the first Nouns-fork to incorporate with fashion, would like to include Nouns‚Äô drop as one of a select few to incorporate Dopamine‚Äôs new web3 streetwear technology (‚ÄùNon-Fungible Streetwear‚Äù). Nouns streetwear will be sold both at the event and online.*\n\n*Funds requested are 62-82Œû, with 85% of the primary sales revenue going to the Nouns treasury.*\n\n![Noggles](https://i.imgur.com/6dxtUlx.jpg)\n\n# Introduction\n\nDopamine is thrilled to collaborate with Apenoun to design a limited-supply Nouns-branded collection of NFT-bundled streetwear. The collection will feature ~500 Nouns streetwear garments, each of which will be patched with a cryptographic NFC chip connecting on-chain to a Nouns-branded NFT that can be authenticated and claimed through a white-labeled Nouns browser app. The branding and experience for this drop will be Nounish end-to-end, and will fully incorporate Dopamine‚Äôs new ‚ÄúNon-Fungible Streetwear‚Äù technology.\n\n[Dopamine](http://dopamine.xyz/) is the first Nouns-fork to incorporate fashion, with the mission to empower Web3 projects, NFT artists, and collectors through a community-owned ecosystem for Non-Fungible Streetwear. We are crypto natives with a passion for streetwear culture and web3 technology, aiming to bridge the gap between these two worlds. \n\nOriginally inspired by Nouns‚Äô creative governance and community model, we want to become an incubator for up-and-coming streetwear designers and NFT artists and recreate the ‚ÄúNouns Virtuous Cycle‚Äù for the budding web3 streetwear industry. \n\nWith this collab we‚Äôre aiming to push the Nounish culture forward and proliferate the Nouns meme and brand across the Metaverse and into mainstream pop culture using a powerful vehicle for hype: streetwear.\n\n# Designs\n\nDopamine will work closely with Apenoun to design the garments, which will feature the Noggles and the Nouns slogan ‚ÄúOne Noun, Every day, Forever.‚Äù Around 500 pieces will be made in total, featuring a combination of t-shirts, hoodies, and various other apparel. Quality-wise, this drop will have a premium feel reminiscent of brands such as Fear of God or Acne Studios, leveraging entirely cut and sew assembly. In terms of past experience, Dopamine‚Äôs design team has worked with the likes of Billie Eilish, Young Thug‚Äôs Spider, and Siberia Hills. \n\nIn addition to the merchandise design, each garment will feature a Nouns clothing patch covering the NFC chip used to connect to its bound Nouns NFT, which itself will include a digital 3D design of the garment along with additional digital accessories (see next section). Finally, the patch itself will also be capable of triggering an AR hologram of the underlying digital design.\n\n![1](https://i.imgur.com/kLfrWi5.jpg)\n\n![2](https://i.imgur.com/kJYBPNF.png)\n\n![3](https://i.imgur.com/63NDcOM.jpg)\n\n![4](https://i.imgur.com/9eqWRdI.jpg)\n\n![5](https://i.imgur.com/FkUXpDq.jpg)\n\n![6](https://i.imgur.com/Axt3asS.png)\n\n![7](https://i.imgur.com/7sRU8u4.jpg)\n\nWe are continuing to iterate with Apenoun on additional designs while ensuring the entire drop remains cohesive.\n\n![8](https://i.imgur.com/31n8Mwe.png)\n\n![9](https://i.imgur.com/p8teGhg.png)\n\n# Non-Fungible Streetwear Technology\n\nDopamine is creating a decentralized fashion technology platform for authenticating and sharing a new form of chip-microchipped streetwear that we call **‚ÄúNon-Fungible Streetwear‚Äù**.\n\nAt the core of each Non-Fungible Streetwear piece is a **physical-bound NFT (PNFT)**, an NFT *forever bound* to the garment through an on-chain registry that uses chip-generated ECDSA signatures for resolution, whose media represents a 3D model of the physical streetwear piece. \n\nBy scanning the garment‚Äôs patched chip with Dopamine‚Äôs white-labeled browser app, garment owners will be able to claim the PNFT, authenticate collection and manufacturer details, and view digital renditions of their streetwear in a 3D-like wardrobe. On top of this, PNFTs may be composed with arbitrary numbers of other digital assets, such as NFTs representing brand-related digital art, music, or perks. \n\nBelow, we dive into more detail on the customization process, on-chain connectivity layer, and scanning flow as it relates to Nouns‚Äô curated Non-Fungible Streetwear collection. \n\n### Customization Process\n\n![wip10](https://i.imgur.com/gErPzVi.jpg)\n\nThe following assets will be required for the Nouns‚Äô Non-Fungible Streetwear collection:\n\n- **Nouns 3D PNFT Design**\nThe design file for the PNFT, which in this case will be a 3D digital rendition of the Nouns physical garment bundled as a GLTF file.\n- **Nouns Accessory Media Files**\nAdditional digital media files may be provided to build accessory NFTs. These could be anything from Nouns Art Basel POAPs to complementary Nouns digital avatars. Unlike the PNFTs which are forever bound to their garments, these accessory NFTs may be attached and detached on-chain to allow for composability with any Non-Fungible Streetwear pieces.\n- **Nouns PNFT Collection Specs**\nOwnership attribution for the Nouns‚Äô Non-Fungible Streetwear will revolve around a custom ERC721-compatible Nouns PNFT collection with a fixed supply of ~500, reflecting the total number of garments distributed. Besides the aforementioned accessorizing, additional specs may be added here, such as collection-wide metadata or whitelisting support.\n\n### On-Chain Connectivity\n\n![11](https://i.imgur.com/zs3fcSV.png)\n\nConnection between Nouns streetwear garments to Nouns PNFTs will be entirely on-chain, and will involve three major components: \n\n**NFC Chip**\n\nDopamine NFC microchips are machine-washable ~30mm round, 1mm thick chips capable of signing messages. Scanning the patched chip will enable chip-signed attestations (secured at the firmware level) to be passed through the on-chain registry to the Nouns browser app for authentication and claiming.\n\n**Chip Registry**\n\nAn ENS-like on-chain registry mapping chip ids to PNFTs will be used for connecting physical and digital worlds together in a truly decentralized manner. Included in each record will be a pre-registered IPFS cert provided by Nouns (e.g. an attestation signed by Nouns Deployer) and the chip manufacturer. \n\n**Nouns PNFTs**\n\nNouns PNFTs will act as the virtual representation and authentication interface for the Nouns‚Äô streetwear garments. Unlike most NFTs, which are normally only owned by a user EOA, these will include two forms of ownership attribution - one involving the garment owner, and one involving the paired chip itself. \n\n### Browser App\n\nThe three above components allow the white-labeled Nouns browser app to process claims, verifications, and transfers in a way that is truly 100% decentralized. Below, we outline at a high-level how claims and normal scans work:\n\n**Claims:**\n\n![12](https://i.imgur.com/KLykF7M.png)\n\nDopamine's Non-Fungible Streetwear uses a physical-first standard for claiming. This means that recipients of the Nouns‚Äô Non-Fungible Streetwear collection will first get the physical garment, and then scan the patched chip using the Nouns browser app shown above to have the ownership attribution of the PNFT assigned to them. For security reasons, only addresses of those which have purchased the collection pieces (either online or live at Art Basel) will be able to invoke the initial claim.\n\n**Scans:**\n\n![13](https://i.imgur.com/uWHAKW2.png)\n\nAnyone with an NFC-enabled smart device will be able to tap their devices on the Nouns‚Äô chip patches to view details regarding garment owner and authenticity through the Nouns browser app. In addition, these scans will showcase the PNFT media assets in an interactive 3D wardrobe-like environment, along with any bundled accessories.\n\n## Dopamineland @ **Art Basel Miami**\n\nThe Nouns x Dopamine drop will feature at our Art Basel Miami multi-day event ‚ÄúDopamineland‚Äù as part of a select group of 5 partners representing the best and the brightest of web3 culture and meme power. \n\nThe Nouns area will be a fully Nouns-branded immersive experience featuring on-site ‚Äúactivations‚Äù giving users direct interaction with the Nouns bundles and their physical-digital features.\n\nNouns Non-Fungible Streetwear will be available for purchase on-site and online via credit card or ETH. For online orders, shipments will be handled through Shopify.\n\n## Nouns x Dopamine Bundle Cost Breakdown\n\nSupply: ~500 (TBD)\n\nCosts: ~82Œû \n\nSupply: ~500 (TBD)\n\nCosts: ~62Œû  - 82Œû \n\n- Curation Fee (incl. Garment Design & Development, Smart Contract Development, 3D Model Design, NFT Design): ~2Œû\n- Garment Production Costs: ~20-25Œû\n- Microchip + embedding: ~5-10Œû\n- Authentication & AR Integration: ~10-15Œû\n- Packaging: ~10Œû\n- Shipping: ~10-15Œû\n- Operational costs: ~5Œû\n\nFunds will be converted to USDC upon transfer to avoid impact from ETH volatility. On project completion, any remaining ETH will be send back to the Nouns DAO treasury.\n\nPrimary Sales: 85% to Nouns DAO Treasury, 15% to Dopamine\n\nSecondary Sales: 5% to Dopamine, Nouns to set secondary fee\n\n## **Timeline**\n\n- September: Design & Development\n- October - November: Production\n- December: Art Basel Dopamine Marketplace Launch\n\n## **Team**\n\nAs mentioned the Dopamine team will work closely with Apenoun to deliver this drop and ensure Nounish branding and experience from start to finish.\n\n![14](https://i.imgur.com/eBt6zGb.png)\n![15](https://i.imgur.com/Oppo3rb.jpg)\n\n![16](https://i.imgur.com/640yaEu.png)\n\n",

      "content": "# Nouns Animated Short Film with Los Angeles Red Carpet Premiere\n\nMy name is Fedja, and I‚Äôm a Montenegrin recent USC graduate, writer, and filmmaker. I was introduced to Nouns by Euwyn (Noun #122 and #341), and fell enamored with the sense of community I‚Äôve observed so far. Nounish-ness is special, and I‚Äôd love to bottle up a bit of this and spread the word about Nouns to larger audience.\n\nThis proposal is for a community-driven, studio-quality animated short film starring a Noun, with a red carpet event in Los Angeles to cap off production and bring Nouns and film community members together to inspire more collaborations.\n\nWith an origin story of falling out of their owner‚Äôs laptop - think ‚ÄúFinding Nemo‚Äù - the protagonist Noun will be animated in stop-motion style, composited on real footage, and film their own journey home. With the Nouns community involvement at each step, the story will be written to be captivating to a broad international audience across different languages, crypto-native and not. \n\n## Why?\n\nAllow us to introduce you to: The Noun. An animated Noun, fallen out of his owner‚Äôs laptop and finding himself lost in the real world. Starting with an animated short, audiences worldwide will watch the charming, adorable, and sneakily snarky Noun overcome obstacles, find and lose love, and much more as he films his journey home. Modernizing the mold of fictional personalities like Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, or Annoying Orange, and inspired by early Pixar shorts, we aim to make the Noun into a well-loved, viral, memeable, sharable character. \n\nA big part of our effort will be involving the community in writing a unique, compelling narrative for the noun. As a storyteller, this is where I‚Äôll be focused. The intimacy of telling his story from his POV, with his phone camera, intercut with 3rd-person footage of his adventures, will build a lasting emotional relationship with his audience that will transfer into future projects, from this team and others. Whether it be longer YouTube videos, a TV series, or even his own feature film, people will follow the Noun wherever he goes ‚Äî in the world or online.\n\nHis story will be designed to be saturated with clipable, memeable, shareable moments that don‚Äôt need context to go viral on their own. However, for the curious viewer, the clips bring them in to a larger narrative designed and produced around a genuine story and loveable protagonist.\n\n## Community-Driven Production\n\nUltimately, we want the character, and the project as a whole, to be completely emblematic of all that is Nounish. Yes, this means quirkiness, humor, personality and spontaneity, but it also means myriad factors and traits we can‚Äôt even begin to predict. This is why throughout the entire creative process we will hold bi-weekly town halls to discuss the script and invite members to share their thoughts. The character bio, the general plot, the finished screenplay, design, locations, all of it. We promise to be receptive to feedback, and additionally will host community feedback sessions to ensure our protagonist is as Nounish as can be.\n\nAlong the Noun‚Äôs journey, he will inevitably interact with other characters and Nouns in the wild, and while the Noun overcomes loneliness, fear, and anxiety, the story will lead towards an ultimate message of the value of community and collective voice. This will open an opportunity for more creatives to build and expand upon what would effectively become the Nouns Cinematic Universe. Other writers, animators, directors, with their own backgrounds, aesthetic styles, and manners of storytelling, can build upon the framework Noun sets and expand with their own real-world Noun characters and stories.\n\nWe‚Äôre not only creating a viral character who will bring attention to the Nouns project, but a platform upon which like-minded creatives can find opportunities to build art.\n\n## Development\n\n\n### Pre-Production\n\n6-8 weeks\n\n- Writing\n- Location scouting\n- Establishing workflow for animation\n- Voice actor casting\n- The casting will likely be the longest part of pre-production. In building a project based around the personality of one protagonist, the casting is crucial. We do it once, we do it right.\n\n### Production\n\n6-8 weeks\n\n- Filming\n- Recording voice lines\n- Animation\n\n### Post-Production\n\n1-2 weeks\n\n- Hiring social media marketing specialist to maximize likelihood of going viral\n- Setting up digital marketing strategy (trending hashtags, etc)\n- Deploying the videos\n\n![Budget Breakdown](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/e/e272bac8a1a6e48b90b3caa34452bb40323cbf8e.jpeg)\n\n\nIt is our goal to create a professional, polished, award-worthy product. As such, we‚Äôre going to need a professional team. Above is our outlined 25 ETH budget, covering a worst-case scenario which can promise a perfect result. We will strive to remain under that budget, however, and any remaining surplus will go towards the following, which we hope piques your interest.\n\n## Los Angeles Red Carpet Premiere \n\nAs the Noun character falls into the real world, so to do we wish to bring this to life. To cap off production, we will host a screening event in Los Angeles with a Nouns step and repeat banner, red carpet, and more, inviting members of the Nouns and film community. It‚Äôll be an opportunity to meet the team behind the project, celebrate together, and provide another occasion for the Nouns community to gather and grow.\n\n## The Team\n\nWho are we!? We‚Äôre (mostly) recent graduates out of LA and Austin, Texas, trying to carve our way creatively. With backgrounds in literature, screenwriting, film production, animation, and design, we‚Äôre coming together to build something not only with catchy style, but with weighted substance. We don‚Äôt just want to work with Nouns to make *something* ‚Äî we believe we can make something *great.*\n\n**Fedja Celebic.**\nProducer, Writer, Director\n\n[Fedja](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fedja-celebic-853522199/) is a USC graduate with a degree that spanned all mediums of writing and a Masters in Literary Editing and Publishing, and has found his creative satisfaction in screenwriting and producing.

By branding and collaborating on Advisry‚Äôs official calendar runway show in September, we will introduce nouns to fashion in an illustrious way.\n\n**Why?**\n\nNouns has effortlessly aligned itself with all realms of high art. As a young fashion label, we are aware of the shift in culture and believe the Nouns Glasses logo is the Nike swoosh of web3. We feel it is necessary for Nouns to be represented in the most iconic facet of fashion culture, the fashion runway show.\n\n**Nouns x Advisry Experience**\n\nWhat Nouns is working towards in the future of web3 aligns closely with the overall goals of Advisry. Advisry and Nouns both strive to build communities to give individuals a voice and platform to express themselves and their ideas on a bigger scale. \n\nThe Advisry X Nouns experience involves ‚ÄúIn Real Life‚Äù events that bring our conglomerates together to communicate the importance of unity and change. Advisry wants to involve web3 in fashion and continue aligning with Nouns on potential future projects. \n\n**How**\n\nTo Nounify the show and after party, we will:\n\n- Provide Advisry X Nouns POAPs to onboard show guests.\n- Provide Nouns gifts for every show guest.\n- Brand Nouns EVERYWHERE at the venue for the show and after party.\n- Include Nouns pieces & looks designed by Keith Herron on the runway.\n- Film a documentary of the process of Nounifying NYFW.\n\n**The Show**\n\nIn September Advisry will be showing their first womenswear collection at New York Fashion Week. The collection titled, ‚ÄúMasculin Feminin‚Äù aims to capture gender inclusivity through 32 looks of traditional and nontraditional womenswear. \n\n**Nouns On The Runway**\n\nAdvisry will include Nouns Sunglasses that will be featured in one of the looks in the runway show. Along with this, one of the models will graze the runway with the Nouns Soft Trunk. There will be two Nouns-themed looks in the show.\n\n![nouns soft trunk.png](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F3f9c2296-0f88-4cad-9653-e37319381ee3%2Fnouns_soft_trunk.png?table=block&id=30217e74-922a-4901-9f78-9c2fe4257837&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n**THE NOUNS SOFT TRUNK**\n\nThe soft trunk design is a reference and ode to custom Goyard and Gucci trunks made for their premier clients. They Screenprint their client‚Äôs names and or logos on the baggage to make them custom. The more thoughtful side of the design is the altering of the trunk itself - changing it from wooden frame structure to a more soft leather structure, similar to a luxury duffle. This trunk design is intended to be immediately iconic due to the pure crossover of a nouns logo with Advisry‚Äôs monogram print.\n\n- A classical trunk shape & hardware, but no wooden frame - it will be made of vegan leather with gold plated .925 silver hardware - structured so it will maintain shape\n- The classic Advisry checkerboard monogram will be embossed into the leather - the nouns glasses will be screenprinted on the bag\n- Made in Italy\n\n**Venue**\n\nThe show will take place in the *Oculus NYC*, an artistic landmark located at The World Trade Center. We will be the first of many fashion brands to utilize this as a show space, which is on its way to becoming one of the new homes of New York Fashion Week.\n\nThe Oculus NYC is located in one of the most heavily foot trafficked areas in all of New York. The building is packed with many storefronts, an NJTransit & major MTA station hub, and was once even home to a Kanye West music video in 2019.  \n\n![Untitled](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fce2080fd-6ae6-4d01-b027-ba4995832001%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=d57f7ed1-c590-4088-8e11-a62f04b37034&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=1460&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n![Untitled](https://polished-walrus-b42.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fd498554e-5c90-4cc2-a6cd-142be2f2c8ae%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=6aa96ec1-ce6d-4561-ae46-a754bac567bb&spaceId=aaa84961-448d-41f3-9787-b37867da72d8&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n**Set Production**\n\n- Dress the runway with Parisian style cafe chairs and tables where guests will be seated\n- Light the show with Parisian style street lamps that are manually operated to highlight models by turning on and off as they walk the runway\n\n**Proposal**\n\n**Fund Advisry to:**\n\n- Occupy the Oculus NYC space for the show and after party\n- Produce all garments and accessories for the show\n- Execute the set design of the show\n- Create collaborative pieces to seed and sell to Nouns new and growing audience of luxury consumers\n- Build out a team to produce, fabricate, style, cast, and model the *Masculin Feminin* Show\n- Brand Nouns throughout the venue using Vinyl, Signage, Video, and more\n\n**Branding**.\n\n- Nouns X Advisry T-shirt collaboration to be gifted and/or sold at the after party\n- Nouns branded drinks at the after party\n- Nouns signage and video being played throughout the venue\n- Nouns branding on all invites and Ads posted by Advisry\n\n**Billboard: a 60‚Äô x 12‚Äô Nouns billboard placed outside of the Oculus, designed by Advisry‚Äôs creative director, Keith Herron. This billboard will reach beyond our fashion week audience and be seen by the heavy traffic of tourists and locals walking through the historic Oculus Space.**  \n\nAccording to the City of New York data last updated on June 30 2022, the Oculus has an average foot traffic of 16,000 people per day\n\n**Documentation**\n\nWe want to create a documentary that captures behind the scenes footage of the Nounification of New York Fashion Week! \n\nTelling the story of how an IRL fashion show can be realized with a Nouns collaboration speaks to how valuable, versatile, and functional the DAO is. The documentary would be the first of its kind and a timeless piece in a world where web3 and the high arts will one day seamlessly grow and work together. \n\nWe would work to publish this documentary on a fashion youtube channel like Vogue, GQ, Etc. \n\n*We are interested in working with the creators of **Prop 73, Stoopid Buddy Doc** to film and produce the documentary but have not yet been in contact with them.* \n\n**How does this benefit Nouns**\n\nNew York Fashion Week is one of the most iconic and respected events in the global fashion industry. By working side by side we will transform the view of Nouns as not only having a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù side of the brand with sunglasses and high quality garments, but also having a leg in the always changing industry of fashion.\n\nNouns holders in NYC will have the opportunity to place their name on our guest list for the runway show and all after parties using an alias to keep identities private.\n\nA multi-faceted branding opportunity that not only reaches the show audience but also the city of New York\n\n**Visibility**\n\nWith past coverage from Vogue, GQ, Forbes, WWD, CFDA, and more we believe we can bring Nouns to the forefront of fashion journalism. \n\nThese platforms will put Nouns on hundreds of thousands of peoples radar if not more. Vogue, GQ, and WWD alone average over 5 to 10 million monthly website viewers and have a combined following of over 100 million people on all of their social media platforms.\n\n**Why work with Advisry?**\n\nAdvisry is a fashion, film, and music label based in NYC. Keith Herron, 22 year old founder and designer, began Advisry when he was in 8th grade and has been growing the brand ever since. Keith has sold Advisry to 35 different countries, was awarded the Gucci Changemakers scholarship and was most recently added to the Designer‚Äôs Hub of CFDA: a members-only incubator of American Designers joining the likes of Marc Jacobs, Rick Owens, Virgil Abloh, and many more.\n\nLast spring Advisry debuted on the runway at NYFW. In his first live show, Keith designed 37 looks and packed out the venue with over 150 people in attendance. \n\nThe fashion industry is very gate kept. There is no actual way to break through the industry in an official way without working with a brand that has already broken through. Historically, the way brands get the opportunity to be on the official fashion calendar is by spending many seasons producing their own runway shows independent of the fashion calendar, hoping to gain the attention of the CFDA. \n\nThe benefit of collaborating with Advisry is it gives Nouns an authentic introduction and inclusion into the fashion industry. Not only is Advisry an up and coming line making a lot of noise for its unique approach, but the brand has also collaborated on web3 drops in the past. Keith was the designer of the Advisry X CreatureWorld clothing collection, one of the most successful physical web3 drops to date. \n\n**Collaborators**  \n\n- **Jean-Michel Basquiat Collaboration**\n\nAdvisry and [The Estate of Jean-Michel Basqiuat](https://www.basquiat.com/) are collaborating on 10 different pieces that will be debuted on the Advisry runway and be shown later on in the month at the Basqiuat museum. This is among the first collaborations ever that the family of Jean-Michel personally handpicked and approved. The pieces are the first of their kind to utilize never before seen artworks by Jean-Michel.\n\nThe fashion show will be closed with three Jean-Michel Basquiat collaboration looks as [Lolo Zouai](https://instagram.com/lolozouai?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) and the orchestra play a cover performance of Tu M‚Äôas Trop Ment. \n\n- **Adidas Collaboration**\n\nAdvisry and Adidas are collaborating on a shoe silhouette designed by Keith Herron that will be featured on many looks throughout the runway show. The shoes will be constructed by hand in New York City\n\n- **NOUNS Collaboration**\n\nFeatured as one of few collaborations in the fashion show alongside **Adidas** and **Basquiat,** with a trunk designed by Keith Herron alongside highlighting the physical glasses on the models. The Nouns collaboration completes the trio - highlighting fine art, heritage footwear, and the future of intellectual property.\n\n**Budget**\n\n*All production costs of the show will be split with Advisry evenly*\n\nNouns collaboration production: **$25,500**\n\n- Nouns x Advisry Soft Trunks: $1,500\n- Nouns Branding: $10,000\n- Clothing Production: $14,000\n\nVenue: **$11,500**\n\n- Rental Price: $10,000\n- Insurance: $1,500\n\nSet Design: **$10,000**\n\n- Cafe table and chair rentals: $5,000\n- Parisian style street lamps: $2,000\n- Audio: $2,000\n- Lighting: $1,000\n\nTeam: **$5,000**\n\n- Producer: $2,000\n- Stylist: $1,000\n- Show runner: $500\n- Models: $1,500\n\n**Total: ~$52,000**\n\n***33 ETH***",

      "content": "More Details + Images: https://nouns.wtf/vote/128\n\nThe Noun Square is a daily Twitter Spaces ritual celebrating Noun O' Clock (NOC) in a fun and engaging format. Spearheaded by Toady Hawk, Ser Noadz and Noun 142, administered by a talented committee of Nounish builders, and supported by a growing international community.\n\nAfter a two week unpaid experiment, plus a one month funded trial (Prop 101), we believe we have proven our worth to the Nouns ecosystem, both as a daily touchpoint for the community, and as a powerful onboarding tool for Nouns-curious passers-by the world over. We are requesting funding to continue running and growing the show for the remainder of the 2022 calendar year.\n\nAccomplishments\n58 Consecutive Daily Spaces, none missed.\nA 24-hour Twitter Space for the nouniverse with over 60 Nounish guests and 1,400+ attendees from all over the world (attendance never dropped below 100 unique listeners all night and day.)\n3 successful Coordinape Rounds completed, awarding USDC to a total of 12 unique contributing members. Pioneering completely decentralized rewards-based compensation based loosely on Nouncil model. Average compensation per contributor $1,500 USDC per round.\n120 Daily Attendees on average, with some shows as high as 400.\nSurpassed our metrics for the entire one month trial in just 2 weeks, and have now in some cases doubled expectations.\nOur Stated Goals from Proposal 101\nScreenshot from Prop:\nScreen-Shot-2022-07-19-at-4-59-28-PM.png\n\nOur Actual Metrics to Date:\n1.2M Tweet Impressions(!!) (More than 2X of goal)\n1,750 Followers (1.5X goal)\nAverage attendance: 120 per day\nFOMO players: average 50 per day\n1,650 Contest Entries (2X of goal)\nScreen-Shot-2022-08-09-at-4-12-11-PM.png\n\n\n\nWe Also Achieved All Broader Goals from Prop 101\nbroad-goals-check.jpg\n\nAmazing Nounish Content\nEngaging Contests\n6 weeks+ of consecutive contests: awarded over 11 ETH in prizes to creative and talented Nounsfolk. Contests have resulted in over 1,650 unique pieces of user-created Nounish art/content so far, and has spawned at least 3 individual Nounish art collections.\nnounish-cloud.jpg\n\nAmong the winning entries of these contests have been some truly incredible pieces of art, including this Watercolor Cloud Noun by Jheeart_NFT.\nWe helped this artist to create a collection \"With Noun\" using Manifold, and release the piece as an NFT (which sold for 0.69!) and she is releasing more pieces in the same style, you can see the collection here.\nOur show has become an efficient marketing tool to discover and recruit new artists & builders for Nouns DAO. With contests we are able to identify top talent and funnel it to Small Grants or Prop House to onboard to building for Nouns!\nSome Other Example Contest Entries\nContest entry from Yujujae Ïú†Ï£ºÏû¨ ‚åê‚ìù¬∞‚ìí Ï≤≠Ïñ¥\nyacht-club-conetest.jpg\n\nNouniversary contest entry by Jhee: jhee-nouniversary.jpg\n\nNouniversary contest entry by Skwalo691\nclock-contest-entry.jpg\n\nThis physical oil painting contest entry from Sasohan\nvan-gogh-noggles.jpg\n\nAwesome Guests\nDeezeFi (twice), David Horvath, Taco Noun, Salvino, Oni, Messhup, Brennen, Grammy-winning Musician Violetta Zironi (who performed live), Stoopid Buddy, Jack Butcher and more.\n\nA Platform for Builders\nWe provide a live and engaged audience for builders to update the audience on the progress of their projects. This is a very effective way for builders to get attention to their work.\n\nFOMO Engagement: Just Look At Those Nouns\nThrough increased FOMO engagement, we have helped mint some truly beautiful Nouns (including an incredible triple Void run!)\n\nsexy-nouns.jpg\n\nUsing POAPs to Gamify Participation and Give a Platform to Artists\nWe have given a daily POAP to attendees of The Noun Square every day since our inception. This is the purest use case for the protocol, and works well for us to incentivize people to attend our Twitter spaces, play FOMO live and participate in our contests.\n\nAdditionally, this has allowed us to feature the art of talented established artists like Ser Noadz, Sam Ellis, SuperTightWoody and Greta Grempllin, as well as giving exposure to talented new creators like 0xAprilia, Illustradora.eth and Leetlestar.\n\nWe also plan to continue to use the data from these POAP distributions in the future to do token-gated raffles and contests that reward past participants and strengthen our community.\n\nBonus Things We've Done That We Didn't Even Say We'd Do\n24-hour Nouniversary Celebration: an audacious Twitter Space on the Nouniversary with dozens of guests booked, contests, games and more.\nOver 1,400+ unique attendees, attendance never dropped below 100 at any time.\n50+ Nounish guests\nAmazing community shared moments.\nNounish NFT collections: We have helped community members to set up Nounish NFT collections based on their Noun Square contest entries using Manifold.\nInternational outreach: We have done outreach to international audiences by hosting non-English Spaces on some Saturdays, and making foreign-language channels in Discord with moderation.\nCommunity involvement in DAO governance: Noun 142 Delegated his Noun to The Noun Square multisig so that we could initiate an Audience Voting initiative.\nWe invite proposers to pitch their proposals to the audience.\nThe audience then votes live in our discord.\nWe then execute the voted on-chain accordingly.\nThis has been a popular segment, and we look forward to expanding on the experiment in future.\nThe Future of the Noun Square\nWe hope the above sections paint a clear picture of all the accomplishments our team has achieved over the past 6 weeks, meeting or exceeding all the engagement goals we set for ourselves in Prop 101.\n\nThe Purpose of this Proposal is to ask the DAO to fund our proven team for an additional 5 months, until the end of the calendar year, to do the following:\n\nContinue to plan and execute daily Twitter Spaces: Engage newcomers, Nouners and Nouns community members alike, with informative guests and fun contests that produce a plethora of Nouns-based art and authentic social media engagement.\nContinue to organize Contests for our community: Using data from our trial, we have found that 1-2 weekly contests with larger prizes are both more effective and less administratively onerous compared to daily contests. We would plan to move forward with 1-2 contests per week with prizes ranging from 0.05-1ETH, which will no doubt encourage more thoughtful and skillful entries (while also peppering in smaller contests live on the show for variety.)\nInnovate on contest voting and prize administration: We have spoken with Nounder Seneca and, if funded, plan to move forward with an implementation of Prop House for our contest entries to be voted on weekly, as an alternative to the current system of emoji voting in Discord.\nWork with the Noun O'Clock Web App team: Iterate with the team to ship a product with product-market fit and integrate these clients with our own site and daily Spaces as much as possible.\nAreas of Focus\nOur vision for TNS in the next 5 months:\n\nInternational growth: As we enter a European/APAC friendly Noun O Clock, we want to seize the opportunity to introduce Nouns to these regions of the world even more than we already have been.\nBe a leading onboarding funnel to Nouns: We have seen initial signs that our show is a great vehicle to onboard artists, builders, and future Nouners to the DAO. We want to lean into this and make sure our show becomes a strong funnel into nouns.\nExpand to new channels: We want to explore growth opportunities via new channels like podcast platforms, Youtube, TikTok and Twitch.\nThe Noun Square as a platform for builders: We want to keep attracting talent to build on top of our show. Two teams (NOC nouns client & NOC Onboarding Materials) have already won prop house funding to build specifically on top of the Noun Square show, in addition to the previously mentioned artists whose collections have been prompted by our contests, and we hope to see more in the coming months.\nSo what does success look like at the end of 2022?\nGrow our twitter followers from 1,600 to 5,000+\nAverage daily attendance by end of year 200+\n5,000+ contest entries\nInternational growth: Our goal is to contribute to growing a much larger international noun ecosystem by end of year. We have already started this outreach and plan to continue with more foreign language \"takeover\" spaces on the weekends, and focus on non-English accessibility in Discord and Twitter.\nBudget\nMonthly Operations Costs:\n\nContest Prizes: 10 ETH\nTeam Compensation and Administration: 50 ETH per month, allocated by Committee Coordinape on a Biweekly basis.\nTime Period: 5 months until end of 2022.\n5 x 60 ETH = 300 ETH\nTotal Proposal Ask: 300 ETH\n(Cost of 3 Daily Nouns Auctions for 5 months of daily Nounish multimedia content and organic social media engagement.)\nTeam\nWe will continue with our \"3C Model\" of governance and accountability:\n\nCore (Founding) Team (Responsible for Execution):\n\nToady Hawk\nNoun 142\nSer Noadz\n\nCouncil (Responsible for Decisions and Daily Direction)\n\nAubtoshi\nBenbodhi\nSuperTightWoody\nRyanMac21\n!Xargs\nSam Ellis\nMaty.eth\nJoshua Fisher\n\nMembers of this committee may rotate depending on timezones, availability, etc. New incoming Committee members from APAC timezones will most probably include 0xigami, Goldy, Mr. Boney, Mintfaced, and more.\n\nCommunity (Talent Funnel for Council)\nAnyone in our Discord and Twitter communities can join and participate in all our public channels to help with contest ideas, guest ideas, and more, and can apply to join the Organizing Committee at any time. We have forked Nouncil governance with procedures for adding/removing contributing committee members at any time.\n\nThe above organizational strategy (modeled loosely on Nouncil) allows us enough structure to execute on a daily basis, as well as enough flexibility to adapt to new timezones and other challenges as they may arise.\n\nStrategy for North American \"Nouns Winter\"\nNOC happening during North American late night/early morning may have some impact on our attendance rate, although we have been attracting a sizable audience from Europe and Asia already (for example, during our recent 24H long Nouniversary Spaces, attendance never dropped below 100 even during NA non-peak hours.) Nonetheless, we think of this as an opportunity rather than a challenge:\n\nProliferation opportunity\nAuction times drifting enable fairer distribution of nouns across the globe. We think of our show drifting with NOC as giving a fairer opportunity for Noun proliferation outside of the Americas timezones\nWe will have the opportunity to engage with international guests, and introduce our nounish energy to a new audience.\nHost Recruiting & Scaling Ops\nWe have begun recruiting additional hosts and administrative helpers from Europe and APAC timezones so that we can smoothly transition into North American night.\nSeveral of our Committee members are also excited to continue hosting/attending the show well into the North American night.\nWe are already pulling in an impressive daily audience from Europe, Australia and Asia (especially Japan and Korea.)\nWe plan to work with members of NounsDAOJapan, NounsDAO Brazil and GnarsDAO (Australia based) to continue to pull in new viewers and new Nounsfolk even through the North American early morning hours.\nNew distribution channels\nWe will begin posting recordings of our daily spaces both on a podcast server and on Youtube, so that North American audiences will still be able to listen and interact with our content daily.\nWe will also experiment with doing trial versions of The Noun Square on Youtube, Twitch, and TikTok Live to test engagement on those mediums.\nScaling with systems\nOur team has created a robust Notion for knowledge management with Planning Documents, Tracking Databases and Daily Run-of-Show Templates to enable onboarding of new hosts and contributors as easy and decentralized as possible.\nLFG!\nWe were funded for a trial and have surpassed all goals and metrics by a large margin, going above and beyond with initiatives such as the 24 hour Nouniversary Spaces.\n\nWe represent a group of committed Nounish builders with a good track record of success, and we are asking for the DAO's trust, as we lean into a very successful concept and continue to improve, grow and scale this new platform centred around the daily Noun O' Clock.\n\nWe believe that in a short time, The Noun Square has become the defacto watercooler of the Nounish ecosystem, as well as an impressive funnel for new Noun owners, artists and builders.\n\nWe are excited by how much more we can do if given a mandate to keep on building throughout the remainder of 2022.\n\nThank you for your support, and we look forward to having you as a guest on the show one day soon!",

Funds requested are ~62Œû - 82Œû, with 85% of the primary sales revenue going to the Nouns treasury.\n\n\n![dopamine1|690x388](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fcb654ffb-1fbf-439e-9acd-16fed749523b%2FIMG_01.jpg?table=block&id=4d66b37a-86ae-48a7-adc2-6c620f477466&spaceId=ba19d8ff-64a6-48a3-b1b8-4d690f10f95f&width=2000&userId=f55ed8db-e5a2-4f22-a7b5-744d0899742f&cache=v2)\n\n\n[Dopamine](http://dopamine.xyz/) is a Nouns-fork with the mission to empower empower Web3 projects, NFT artists, and collectors through the world‚Äôs first community-owned ecosystem for non-fungible streetwear. We are homegrown web3 natives aiming to bridge the gap between streetwear & crypto culture.\n\nInspired by Nouns DAO, our membership structure has a Nounish distribution, and we‚Äôll be kicking off our auctions later this year. Holders of Dopamine Membership NFTs determine the creative direction of Dopamine, in addition to revenue sharing and perks at our IRL events.\n\nAs a streetwear-focused web3 project our goal is to bridge the divide between the physical and digital worlds. Though we recognise the growing market for digital-only fashion, as Hypebeasts who tend to spend [an insane amount of money](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/streetwear-supreme-fans-spending-habits/) on streetwear and [sneakers](https://stockx.com/news/sneakerheads-spend-10-of-income-on-kicks/#), we love our physical pieces and really couldn‚Äôt live without them.\n\nIn contrast to a project like RTFKT for example we are physical-first, meaning that upon physical delivery of our garments, customers must scan a microchip to authenticate ownership, after which they will receive the bundled NFTs.\n\nIt‚Äôs undeniable that NFTs have unleashed a new cultural revolution, putting the creative power in the hands of digital artists, musicians, and photographers, and creating an exploding market for digital collectibles. This is the energy we want to bring to streetwear.\n\nSo we‚Äôre taking the best of both worlds as physicals take us off our screens and bring us together through something tactile, while NFTs unlock a new world with limitless creative possibilities.\n\nThe Dopamine Team is thrilled to collaborate with Apenoun to design a limited-supply Nouns-inspired non-fungible streetwear bundle for the Dopamine Marketplace launch at Art Basel Miami. With this collab we hope to push the Nounish culture forward and proliferate the Nouns meme and brand across the Metaverse and into mainstream pop culture.\n\n\n## **Non-Fungible Streetwear Bundles**\n\nThe main product Dopamine offers partners are limited-edition ‚Äúnon-fungible streetwear bundles‚Äù consisting of these parts:\n\n- The physical streetwear piece embedded with the Dopamine microchip.\n- The ‚Äúphysical-bound NFT‚Äù (PNFT), a digital 3D model of the piece, forever cryptographically bound to the microchip.\n- ‚ÄúAccessory NFTs‚Äù, which could include digital art, represent brand loyalty or event perks, or any other creative expression partners wish to include in the bundle.\n\n![dopamine2|690x388](https://www.notion.so/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F75a968c0-03ba-467c-8271-032bd8679892%2FScreenshot_2022-08-01_at_12.07.54.png?table=block&id=0876c198-98e2-4ea3-bd2a-816177363ff5&spaceId=ba19d8ff-64a6-48a3-b1b8-4d690f10f95f&width=2000&userId=f55ed8db-e5a2-4f22-a7b5-744d0899742f&cache=v2)\n\n\n## **Dopamine Studio Curation**\n\nDopamine Studio is the one-stop shop for brands and creators to create Non-Fungible Streetwear either from scratch or by bundling their already existing merchandise. \n\nThis product is intended to be released nearing Q1, providing a Manifold-like experience to end-to-end collection curation made specially for streetwear.

We attract many builders, artists, and creatives, with more to come as a result of our upcoming PFP project. The mission of Shark Labs is to implement a structure in which we can more efficiently utilize and support contributors in deploying projects that add value to Nouns with a regular cadence.\n\n---\n\n \n![_15.png](ipfs://bafkreibexnxvx74cecnj2mgfwnl7zqg2x7trkxbpvxv3he3rcu3evcj4za)\n    \n\n*Excerpt from the Shark Street Comic #2, by Maty*\n\n---\n# Outlet Details\n\n- **Art Reef:** An art laboratory for nounish creatives to add content to Nouns lore, create cc0 art for both SharkDAO & Nouns DAO, as well as support emerging artists. For this period, the Art Reef is interested in offering grants for projects that add background stories and personality to Nouns characters.\n\n- **Builders Bay:** Advise and support the planning, development, and implementation of open source software projects that are focused on adding value to the SharkDAO/ NounsDAO ecosystem. For this funding period, the Development outlet will operate with an emphasis on attracting more builders to the Nouns ecosystem, funding and advising projects that seek to create efficiencies in coordination and collaboration amongst Sharks & Nouners, as well as tools that streamline processes for evaluating and awarding project grants and retroactive funding.\n\n- **Media Cove:** Oversee the production of various media efforts designed to promote and educate those interested in the SharkDAO/ NounsDAO ecosystem, keep Sharks and Nouners informed about the latest initiatives, and perpetuate the Nounish culture through appropriate mediums. During the funding period, the Media Cove is going to expand its team to host events on a weekly basis, as well as establish new formats to broaden the reach of Sharks and Nouns.\n\n# Operational Structure\n\n- If passed, the funds from this proposal will be equally split (33 ETH each) between the 3 outlets. For transparency and efficiency, 5 signers will be nominated to sit on a dedicated multisig.\n- Each outlet will be managed by a trusted SharkDAO contributor. The outlet managers will be responsible for keeping projects on track, providing updates to NounsDAO, and organizing the election of committee members and multi-sig signers.\n    - Art Reef ‚Äî Marxistmillionaire\n    - Builders Bay ‚Äî Nick Dodson\n    - Media Cove ‚Äî Cryptasha\n- DAO members submit project ideas to the outlets for a committee of fellow contributors to deliberate and advise.

His face appears on posters all over Paris and has been since 2001. Often found next to Invader or M. CHAT, John is a mystery and a joke in the art world. His motto is 'It is the promotion that makes the artist or the zero degree of art.' Recently, John has shown a lot of interest developing ideas around AR and Metaverse/NFTs.

His face appears on posters all over Paris and has been since 2001. Often found next to Invader or M. CHAT, John is a mystery and a joke in the art world. His motto is 'It is the promotion that makes the artist or the zero degree of art.' Recently, John has shown a lot of interest developing ideas around AR and Metaverse/NFTs. He has reached out to Coralorca after a Twitter follow, and they talked about doing some nounish things together, starting with a noggles campaign.   \n## VALUE PROPOSITION\nIt is interesting for NounsDAO to position themselves along something mysterious that comes from the streets, from the art world, and support artists while doing so.

For folks who missed it: an overview of the Nouns Client round:\n\n- [35 proposals](https://prop.house/nouns-mandates) from top caliber builders\n- 1416 votes casted (a record for Prop House)\n- [4 teams funded](https://twitter.com/nounsprophouse/status/1551692309116379137)\n- A record breaking % of highly desirable proposals\n- Noun-pilled top quality folks\n\nThis time around, we‚Äôd be inviting builders to propose ideas for alternative Nouns Governance clients. While our classic [nouns.wtf/vote](https://nouns.wtf/vote) gets the job done, there is a lot more to explore regarding Nouns governance. This might take several directions:\n\n- Delegation marketplace\n- Better info curation to make more informed decisions\n- New voting / dicussions mechanisms for Nouners to better signal prior to going on-chain\n- Post-funding trackers\n\n> Recommended reading to get creative juices flowing: [Discussion: Request for Nounish Governance Experiments](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/discussion-request-for-nounish-governance-experiments/1859)\n\nThe thing to note is that there are good ideas outside of the community and highly competent builders ready to execute on them. Prop House mandated rounds are a way to not only build up the Nouns ecosystem but also onboard top-notch builders as well.\n\n# Scope\n\nThe mandate would be around Nouns Governance. Any proposal to build a client that improves Nouns Governance in a meaningul way is welcome.\n\nThe round will be hosted in the [Nouns Mandates house](https://prop.house/nouns-mandates) with two weeks proposal time and one week for voting by nouners.\n\n# Safe\n\nFunds will be managed from a 2/3 safe at `0x58a25b8C593C75F6bcEb2C805a53437DA3C53757` managed by seneca, devcarrot and cdt.",

The remaining ETH was held in a Gnosis until samples were delivered and the tooling was complete. \n \nEarly May they cashed out: \n5E at ~$3,029 (4/17) = 15,145 \n5E at ~$2,930 = 14,650 \n10 at ~$2,450 = 24,200 \nTotal = ~53,995 USDC (would have been 57,000 if cashed out right way) \n \nAfter this, while the funds were in the Gnosis the price of ETH dropped significantly and we began discussing what we should do for creators needing USD to complete projects moving forward. We saw an example with Prop 73 where the funds were converted to USDC. We landed on this being a good path forward.  We continued to discuss balances needed to complete projects before this precedent was set. \n \nFor Klim the remaining ETH was held in a Gnosis Safe while tooling was completed and samples were made. He delivered his product on time as promised. He incurred additional expenses for rush fees and shipping on samples that were sent to Austin & NYC. He is now ready for production but the funds are short. \n \nWhile tooling was being created and the price of ETH dropped significantly I was not comfortable making any decisions with the DAO‚Äôs funds independently. I began having multiple conversations within the DAO to discuss how to finish this Prop and the best path forward.  It seemed that converting the balance in the Gnosis to USDC was the best move while we figured out how to treat the remaining funds needed to complete the Prop.  On July 8th I made a Swap for the remaining 35ETH to USDC and sent 42,163 USDC to Klim.  \n \nThe total needed to finish this project is $116,000 of which Klim has $42,000.

      "content": "# Nouns Jokedao Grant\n\nDiscourse link: [https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-jokedao-for-nouns/1836](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-jokedao-for-nouns/1836)\n\n## Description\n\njokedao has built the first on-chain, bottom-up governance platform for communities to submit proposals and vote on their favorites; it enables community-set governance for user-generated roadmaps, grants, endorsements, bounties, curation, and contests.\n\nOne of the major benefits of on-chain voting is that it can allow for extensible contracts‚Äîthat is, transactions that automatically execute depending on the results of a vote. For example, a community could vote on who to receive funds or what NFT to buy or even mint, and depending on the result of the vote, the transaction would be executed.\n\nMore excitingly, it also enables composable governance that could combine different transactions. For example, a community could vote on different features for an NFT, and the top three options could be combined to mint a unique image reflecting the different votes.\n\nExtensible contracts would enable a whole new generation of projects in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\nSome examples, please: how will this proliferate Nouns?\n\nWe imagine Nouns forks in the future won‚Äôt simply replicate Nouns but develop unique minting and auction mechanisms of their own to innovate on the Nouns playbook‚Äînot simply its art, but its model.\n\nHere are a few examples of Nouns forks that jokedao could enable through extensible contracts:\n\nCreate-a-Noun. Communities could submit and vote on the different properties of a Nouns that could then be automatically generated to incorporate each of the individual qualities.\n\nUser-generated Nouns. Enable NFT-derived voting power so that communities could create interactive Nouns projects in which the holders of NFTs could collectively submit and vote on the design of each subsequent NFT.\n\nNouns governance giveaways. Every 10th Noun (derivative) could be given away to a member of the community who had voted on the most winning options in the previous 9 contests, in order to incentivize voting and reward those who build social consensus with a community to vote on winning options.\n\nNouns governance rewards. Rewards (NFTs, Poaps, tokens, portions of the treasury, etc.) could be given away to those who have voted consistently in Nouns proposals in order to incentivize active participation.\n\nOn-chain Nouns Grants. jokedao could collaborate with Prop House to enable fully on-chain and open-source grants for communities to use to incentivize builders to develop their NFT universe.\n\n## Context\n\njokedao started as a Nouns fork through its proof-of-concept, the jokerace‚Äîa weekly contest in which the community of $JOKE holders votes on the 2nd best joke of the week, which is minted as an NFT that‚Äôs sold on a recurring basis. It is likely the first case in which an NFT collection was fully community-created. Since launching in the spring, the jokerace has regularly drawn around 100 weekly players who return each week, consistently sold NFTs, and incentivized the creation of teams that compete. In other words, as a DAO, it‚Äôs organically incentivized the creation of subDAOs without input or management from the core team.\n\nSince then, jokedao has built a platform with scaffold eth for creating and running contests by minting voting tokens and sharing them with communities. Currently 8 EVM-compatible chains are supported so communities can deploy contests and voting tokens on Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, etc. We are relaunching with clean, beautiful UI in a few weeks.\n\nProjects like MetricsDAO and Backdrop already use jokedao for contests with their community, and jokedao has soft commits from about another dozen projects in the space to use it for governance after the site relaunch‚Äîmany of these are NFT projects looking to give their communities more ways to collectively create NFTs themselves. Other popular use cases include grants, giveaways, and content creators letting their communities tell them what kind of content to create.\n\nFinally, let‚Äôs emphasize that neither bottom-up nor on-chain governance have been unlocked in NFTs or DAOs to date. Projects typically give few avenues for their communities to express their ideas or cocreate beyond approving proposals of a core team. And on-chain governance has been prohibitive due to gas fees until the past few months.\n\nBoth of these unlock exciting opportunities for DAOs and NFT projects to create far more inclusive and incentivized communities‚Äîas we‚Äôve seen with both Nouns and the jokerace.\n\n## Why?\n\nNouns is unique among NFT projects for a number of reasons‚Äîbut perhaps most of all that it‚Äôs the only NFT project with the means and model to incentivize builders to develop its ecosystem‚Äôs value through forks, homages, expansion packs, and next-generation projects. No other NFT project has this.\n\nJokedao‚Äôs thesis is that the next wave of NFTs and DAOs will be far more interactive and community-governed than this last wave‚Äîwhich has primarily seen centralized figures appealing to consumers to support them, rather than to actively cocreate. Nouns has shown the strongest evidence of this trend, and it seems clear that the next generation of NFT DAOs will go further in letting their communities compete, team up, and create as fun forms of gamified governance. Nouns is in the best position to support these projects within its own ecosystem to grow its value, and jokedao would love to team up to make it happen.\n\n## Deliverables\n\nExtensible contract module: enabling contests to automatically execute transactions depending on the result of a vote\nCreator submission control: enabling only contest creators to submit options for a community to choose from (avoiding user-generated code that may have issues)\nComposable contracts: enabling different winning votes to be combined, for example to combine different properties of a Nouns into a new NFT\nCore Team\n\nDavid Phelps is a 2x SaaS founder who cofounded ecodao, created a web3 angels collective (cowfund), advises TCG Crypto, is a Gitcoin Steward, and writes on web3 on his substack and twitter 1. He was named one of the top 20 leaders in the DAO space by Seed Club.\n\nSean McCaffery is a Software and Data Engineer with a background in building systems for finance and data analytics firms, is building DAOs including Juicebox and the towers three, and has been the engineer of jokedao‚Äôs entire current site. Here is their GitHub 1 and Twitter.\n\nNaomi Hauret has been a front-end developer for the past 6 years. She‚Äôs designed and developed Tombheadzzz, developed the UI and frontend for ftm.bet, and has designed and developed holodevdao, a derivate NFT viewer for the Dev NFTs of Developer DAO. You can see her github here 1.\n\n## Budget\n\nWe anticipate extensible contracts to be a 10-week project, and we pay each member $2,000 USD per week. At current prices, total projected costs run around 50 eth.",

An Animated Pilot\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HhUV4YP.jpg)\n\n# **TL;DR**\n**PPT Studios is asking for $500K (~Œû320 at the time of 07/28/22) to make one 11-minute episode of Nouns! An Animated Series. This show would be CC0.**\n\n# **DESCRIPTION**\n**We propose to create a pilot for *Nouns! An Animated Series*.** \n*Nouns! An Animated Pilot* is a 2D tradigital animated 11-minute episode as seen in the [Prop 70 (CC0 Pitchbook)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/70). The show is an animated comedy following the surreal adventures of best friends balancing the desire for mature adulthood and their reluctance to grow up.\n\n# **We propose doing a pilot in 3 phases.**\n**1) Script and Casting (weeks 1-6)** **$150K** \n*-1st milestone Deliver Script Tk01 Draft (End of Week 3)*\n**2) Animatic (weeks 4-11) $200K** \n*-2nd milestone Deliver Storyboards (End of Week 9)*\n**3) Final Animation (weeks 10-16) $150K** \n\nWe are targeting the schedule for ~16 weeks. However, we may need some flexiblity and increase the time it takes to deliver the pilot to ensure we can put out the best product possible.\nIf we start at the beginning of August, we can deliver before the year end.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mKXuW47.jpg)\n\n## **Phase 1: Scripting and Casting** \nThis phase would last for four-six weeks.\nDuring this phase we would work on the outline, script, script revisions and cast the episode.\nStart Date: **08/01/22** \n\n## **Phase 2: Preproduction**\nStarting week 4, we would begin Phase 2.\nThis phase would last seven weeks.\nDuring this phase, we will thumbnail, and storyboard, refine character designs, and backgrounds, create digital puppets and record scratch tracks and audio.\nStart Date: **08/22/22**\n\n## **Phase 3: Production/ Post**\nStarting week 10, we would begin Phase 3.\nThis phase is where the actual animation begins, with compositing, editing, and putting the final touches on everything.\nStart Date: **10/03/22**\n\n# **TOTAL ASK:**\n**~Œû320 or ($500K USD)** to fund the creation of Nouns! An Animated Pilot. \n*The ETH will be immediately converted to USDC to ensure we have funding to cover production costs.*\n\n**MULTISIG**\nThe proposed budget + Œû1 to cover gas fees will be released in ETH to a 3 of 4 multisig with signers **JoelCares**, **ToadyHawk**, **Benbodhi** and **thepencil.eth**. The ETH will be immediately converted to USDC, and everything in excess of the original budget, minus 1 ETH to cover gas for the life of the multisig, will be returned to the DAO. If, due to high volatility, insufficient ETH is available to cover the proposed budget, a second proposal will top up the multisig at a later date.\n\n**Multisig address:**\n0x3D2268fa80B76448A8b33d554A3E972f5d8d5534\n\n**Phases to be funded at the commencement of each phase. Note that these are guidelines only and that a final determination will be made in collaboration with the person-place-thing-escrow multisig.*\n\nThe funds will go to pay for the following:\n\n**STAFF** \n- Writers \n- Casting Agents \n- Voice Actors \n- Audio Engineers \n- Storyboard Artists \n- Animatic Artists \n- Editors\n- Producers \n- Directors \n- Technical Director \n- Character Designers \n- Color Artists \n- Background Designers \n- Build Artists \n- Lead Animators \n- Production Animators \n- Compositors \n- Effects Artists \n- Retake Animators\n- Editors \n- Audio Engineers\n- Funding for music \n- Production Coordinators\n- Production Assistants to support artists, track assets and manage schedules\n\n**Software Licenses**\nSoftware to be used includes, but is not limited to: \n- Adobe Photoshop \n- Cinesync \n- Toonboom Harmony\n- Adobe After Effects \n\n# **Q&A:**\nSam and Jason will make themselves available for Q&A in the Nouns Discord and on a Nouners call if needed.\n\n**Q:** Why is this single episode $500K when the six episodes before came out to ~$333K each?\n \n**A:** When amortizing costs across multiple episodes of a season, the overall cost per episode decreases. Artists' short-term freelance rates are higher than longer-term employment rates. There are also discounts on software subscriptions for longer-term commitments.\n\n# **WHY IS THIS UNIQUE?**\nIn developing *Nouns! An Animated Series*, the mission of *Person Place Thing Studios* is to share, inspire, and empower people around the globe through CC0 storytelling.\n\nAs paid professionals in the animation space, we aim to modernize the animation studio and pipeline by no longer requiring industry talent to be tethered to an antiquated studio system, a specific geographic location, or a traditional network distribution model.\n\nWe plan to hire best-in-class artists and designers, make broadcast-quality Nounish content at an accelerated pace, and proliferate Nouns to a worldwide audience via the internet.\n\n# **WHAT IS THE TONE OF THE SHOW?**\n*Nouns! An Animated Series* draws from similar humor and animation quality as *The Regular Show* and *Adventure Time*.  We want to create shows that make us laugh!  Our cast of characters are goofballs!  They escalate simple situations into ridiculous adventures that are filled with unpredictable twists and turns. They rarely solve their problems but always end with a laugh!\n\n# **WHY SHOULD WE BACK THIS?**\n- Bringing Nouns to life through animation is the next leap in introducing these characters to the mainstream culture of all ages.\n- Distributing on Youtube, Twitter, Tiktok, etc, allows Nouns to reach an enormous audience.\n- Casting top talent as the voices of our characters will bring known celebrities to the world of Nouns and generate larger social media awareness and traditional media buzz.\n- Developing episodes in the 11-minute format also opens the door to legacy media distribution.\n\n# **BENEFITS TO THE DAO**\n- We love the Nouns characters and are dying to see them come to life!\n- Pilot episode will be CC0!\n- Cartoons are a great source of memeonic content; our show will create many shareable clips that can help with the mission of proliferation.\n- Cartoons are also a great invitation to a much wider and younger audience. \n- There will be new nounish content made and shared every day!\n- Having an animated show will add value to other extensions in the Nouns ecosystem.\n- Through Discord, the DAO will be an active participant in the creative process.\n- Any profits obtained will be reinvested in the studio to make additional Nouns animated content.\n- *Person Place Thing Studios* can be utilized in the creation of content for future DAO Proposals (episodic cartoons, commercial endeavors, music videos, shorts, etc)(i.e. The Greidiens pitch gets sold to a network, rather than having to shop around looking for a studio to work with we would already be set up to handle their needs.)\n- As educators, we will be inviting and sending the CC0 assets to schools for their students to use as they learn animation while creating nounish content.\n\n# **WHO ARE THE CREATIVES?**\n\n**Sam Ellis:**\nSam Ellis (Person) makes comics, cartoons, and games (Things) although he has also helped create a few people as well. He has worked for a myriad of comic publishers, animation, and game studios in a variety of positions from LA to Atlanta (Places). Some of his past projects have been: *Archer, Adventure Time, Bravest Warriors, The Awesomes, Frisky Dingo, Catbug*, and more.\n\n**Jason Shwartz:**\nJason Shwartz is an Emmy-nominated Director with extensive experience in broadcast television production and direction. He has directed broadcast shows for *Netflix, [adultswim], Comedy Central, Hulu, 20th Century Fox, SyFy, AppleTV, IFC, FX, and Disney*.  He has produced original animated content for social games with companies including *Disney Interactive, Marvel, ESPN, and Garfield*.\n\nJason has worked on popular television shows including *Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Wolfboy and the Everything Factory, Squidbillies, The Masked Singer, Paradise Police Department, Lazor Wulf, The Awesomes*, and more!\n\n**Previous accomplishments in the proliferation of Nouns:**\n- [Co-developed NounsTown, an extension project of Nouns introducing PFD (profile deeds) A profile picture that proves ownership of land in the metaverse](https://nounstown.wtf/), and a [Nouns Auction Tracker](https://nounstown.wtf/tracker).\n- Brought and showcased Nounish extensions into the metaverse via BLOCKS giving the ability to make user-generated content easy to share, such as 3D Nouns and other projects.\n- [Active Nouncil member that regularly participates in voting](https://nouncil.wtf/)\n- [Active participant and on the organizing committee for The Noun Square (A group of nounish builders hosting daily celebrations around Noun O‚ÄôClock)](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock)\n- Introduced Samsung to Nouns (through Joey at Buoy Studio) which lead to their video in Times Square and 837X DCL experience.\n- [Prop 70 (CC0 Pitchbook)](https://nouns.wtf/vote/70)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Kamhh0c.jpg)\n\n# **PITCHBOOK:**\n*Below are attached parts of the pitchbook from Prop 70, we thought rather than attaching all the pages we would just attach a few.* \n**The outlines, character bios, and their designs will be further developed if funded.*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nPySACM.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OOerzzy.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/n8f0qi3.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UDAn6Zw.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FtnmcAD.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pW3qMnG.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iSAAAiX.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0lvXKtH.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KFIPUSz.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S4Y0uQl.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/v3tPsar.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pKfvpDI.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xvRZ4b4.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9TGaTG9.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0VVEX0M.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wd2ngDd.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HpaAM1z.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CuMar4K.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m8NXn8N.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2U1AyiE.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gsEEIlO.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/eqrbhiM.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ua8N87m.png)",

      "content": "# Nouns Esports Pod\n\nWritten by [Sasquatch](https://twitter.com/PartSasquatch) and [Maty](https://twitter.com/matyETH) \n\n### **Goal**\n\nProliferate Nouns through esports initiatives. Fuel the growth of a sub-community within the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n### **Description**\n\nContinuing the work of Prop #68, #91, and #112, this Esports Pod (comprised of esports-native Nouners and Nounsfolk) will function in a manner similar to the thriving small grants initiative within Nouns. It will use a delegated treasury to look for outsized opportunities within esports to continue proliferating Nouns with the best ROI possible. \n\n#### **Didn't we just pass an esports proposal?**\n- All of our esports proposals so far have been game-specific.\n- We have a very deep talent pool of esports native Nouners and Nounsfolk who can capably proliferate across a variety of titles.\n- Having quick access to funds will allow for better proliferation, as the competitive landscape has an ever-evolving calendar that makes the formal proposal process slow. \n- The pod has already been pitched multiple proposal ideas from high-level esports operators.\n    - Sending international players to the largest fighting game event.\n    - Sponsoring a high-level Dota LAN.\n    - Signing a League of Legends team.\n\n### **Esports Pod**\n- Consisting of Nouners and Nounsfok who are familiar with esports and aligned towards the mission of proliferation across the DAO. \n    - **Sasquatch** (Nouncil, Esports background)\n    - **Brennen** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Maty** (Nouncil)\n    - **Oni** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Brian Cho** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Jason Oliver** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **Deeze** (Nouner, Esports background)\n    - **thebeautyandthepunk** (Nouner) \n    - **Brax** (Esports background)\n    - **PPD** (Esports background)\n    - **Griff** (Esports background)\n\n#### **Pod Structure** \n- The structure of the pod will be flexible, this means members can be added/removed based on a supermajority vote.\n- Upon initial deployment, the pod will functionally operate inside of the Nouns Esports Discord server.\n- Members of the Pod will vote over each proposed use of funds.\n    - Any member can sponsor a proposal.\n- A multi-sig consisting of Sasquatch, Brennen, Maty, Brian Cho, and Oni will operate funds.\n- All use of funds will be documented in a manner transparent to the Nouns community.\n\n### **Budget: 369 ETH**\n- This budget will be governed by the members of the Esports Pod and controlled by a 3/5 multi-sig. \n    - Address: [0x8b45D1CACcb3593E9F1015BA8e97AFB68DE3a0d1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8b45D1CACcb3593E9F1015BA8e97AFB68DE3a0d1)\n- For operational purposes, we will keep a portion of the standing budget as the stablecoin DAI.\n- Distribution:\n    - Proposals (~90%)\n    - Operations (max 10%) -  We've already had a broad range of contributions, any compensation related to those efforts (outside of individual proposals) will have to be voted on internally and awarded retroactively.\n        - Running weekly meetings, onboarding esports operators into Nouns, Discord & Twitter management, building the prop, multiple people taking calls and evaluating pitches, etc. \n        - May explore using Coordinape.\n#### **Potential Use of Funds**\n- Flexible funding towards infrastructure costs for each team we sign to Nouns Esports.\n    - Bootcamps, logistics, special events. \n- Sponsoring additional players, streamers, or teams.\n    - Each game is its own vertical to build within.\n- Funding Projects:\n    - Nouns Network\n        - We see the talent network at Nouns to be one of the best features to leverage as we grow.  These projects may already be independently funded, we would have standing budget available to work with them in an esports capacity.\n            - Examples:\n                - Nouns Esports x [Nounish](https://twitter.com/nounish) (Prop 64) - Filming our players at events, advising on marketing strategy.\n                - Nouns Esports x [Nouns Brand](https://twitter.com/nounsbrand) (Prop 109) - Designed outfits for the players at events, merch for fans.\n                - Nouns Esports x [NOUNS ON THE GROUND](https://twitter.com/nounsotg) (Prop 110) - Sending the Proliferation Pod to events our teams compete in.\n                - Supporting an Esports [Prop House](https://twitter.com/nounsprophouse).\n    - Event Sponsorships\n        - Outsized opportunities to have high brand exposure through streaming or physical events.\n    - Streamers, Pros, or Casters with AR or Physical Noggles.\n    - Creating gamer Noggles with blue light filter.\n    - Creating team jerseys for players and fans.\n- Forking Nouns to create an esports-specific subDAO\n    - Designs created to represent games we participate in.\n### **Future**\n- Sustainability\n    - We believe Nouns Esports inherently works to proliferate the Nouns brand, but we are still interested in exploring a path towards creating a self-sustaining sub-community. \n    - Pillars this could be built on:\n        - Forking Nouns\n            - Exploring a subDAO mechanic which allows for fans to engage with the team at a greater level than existing esports organizations.\n        - Sponsors\n            - Traditional web2 sponsors.\n            - Web3 sponsors that the DAO chooses to affiliate with.\n        - Nouns Esports in-game items\n\n### **Testimonials**\n\n> e-sports has been one of the highest ROI proposals (in terms of attention generated) thus far...the success of nouns e-sports clearly demonstrates the power of handing the reigns to the community\n -[Nounder 4156](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1544800982399438849)\n\n>  I was a bit skeptical at first I'll admit but it was our Dota team that got my brother (a perennial crypto skeptic) to go from \"all NFTs are a scam\" to \"all NFTs except for Nouns are a scam\" ... which to me felt big\n -[Nouncillor brianj](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/943943469821476944/996129684200894526)\n \n > One of the reasons why I bought a noun was because I saw the positive impact that the nounsesports was creating to the greater gaming community...watching the dota 2 esports community (hardcore pc gamers) embrace the nouns ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® meme has been incredible\n-[Nouner Brian Cho](https://twitter.com/brianjcho/status/1543411851907645440)\n\n> Nounsesports was how I first learned about nouns and was really impressed with how the group was able to resonate with a hardcore gaming audience such as pro Dota 2 fans. Given my background helping to build esports at Riot and then as a board director at Astralis, I‚Äôm a big believer that esports helps gamers turn their love for games into part of their broader identity. I‚Äôm excited to work with the Nouns esports team to proliferate the nouns brand to gamers through esports.\n-Nouner Jason Oliver [via DM]",

      "content": "NOUNS Wellness APP (iOS + Android)\nWho Said Mental Health Needs to Be Boring?\nNouns can be THE brand at the forefront of bringing wellness to young people worldwide in a playful, effective and engaging way.\n\nOur Mission: To Proliferate the Nouns Brand by Helping Kids Globally Who Are Suffering Mentally After the Global Pandemic ‚Äì Free of Charge.\n\nWe challenged ourselves to design an initiative that prioritized improving overall mental and physical wellbeing irrespective of school, workplace and home settings. An initiative that is comprehensive in nature, flexible in delivery, and aligned with specific wellbeing objectives that are drawn from global social and emotional wellness research. Combining our depth of experience in app development, education and content creation to deliver a remarkable outcome.\n\nWe have already created over 100 apps and wellness programs to great success, this will be our best of the best - an innovative, Noun branded mobile app for iOS and Android that will be an important support for kids when they need it most.\n\nWhat Are You Proposing?\nNOUNS Wellness (name to be confirmed) is a mobile mental health app for the next generation. Using play and community spirit, kids are inspired and engaged with games and activities to actually practice mental health daily.\n\nThis proposal will cover details on how we can do this and why we are the team who can make this happen.\n\nAnd also how this initiative is more than a good idea‚Ä¶\n\nIt‚Äôs potentially the very essence that makes NOUNS nounish. And what we see is a perfect match to the mission to not only proliferate the NOUNS brand, but also the NOUNS‚Äô mission of goodwill.\n\nLET‚ÄôS GO!\n\nWhy Are You Doing It?\nMental health has never been more important post pandemic‚Ä¶\n\n‚Ä¶And this time it‚Äôs the kids who are feeling the pressure, not just stressed out adults or Web3 degens. There are global stats that show some very alarming numbers with teen depression, anxiety and sadly suicides. There‚Äôs a lot to find wrong with the world, so activaley reminding, educating and inspiring young people has become integral to their wellbeing and their future.\n\nNouns Wellness will also have a natural ripple effect through our Web3 community. As part of the crypto culture, mental health is on everyone‚Äôs lips in Twitter Spaces and in Discord, but there has yet to be the wellness project to emerge and really connect with and serve the wider Web3 community.\n\nNouns is a project close to our hearts and we are aligned with what it represents. It excites us to see the diverse range of future collaborations and partnerships where we can proliferate the brand and its mission.\n\nWhy Nouns?\nSomething that makes habits stick and fitness routines engaging is play and fun.\n\nAs pioneers in transforming fitness education with play at its center, we saw immediately how a playful and fun brand like Nouns can boost the wellness conversation with young people.\nAnd at the same time boost the Nouns brand and positioning further, by activating real world engagement with Nouns and the super healthy benefits of a wellness practice.\nIn a word‚Ä¶ Nouns will make wellness FUN. And Nouns are what wellness will look like for young kids. No-one is owning this wellness space for kids the way Nouns can.\n\n(Plus as a Web3 native brand Nouns open the door to the conversation with young people about NFTs and what the blockchain means to our future.)\n\nHow Is This Different to What‚Äôs Already out There?\nThe go-to apps out there: Headspace, Calm and similar, are designed for adults.\n\nThey also only offer one type of mindfulness, (including ones for children) - guided experiences that are consumed in one direction. In our decades of experience with kids (and adults too) we have proven that interactive activities and playful tasks are game changers. Like moving your body with active play instead of reps on a gym mat.\n\nThis interactive approach is a major point of difference in the overall physical and mental wellbeing space. There are so many ways of doing wellbeing, but they‚Äôre not fun‚Ä¶ Until NOUNS Wellness.\n\nAdditionally: The app source code we create will be open source and available for use by the Noun community.\n\nWho Is the Audience? How Are You Going to Market This App?\nAs established business owners and leaders in the fitness, education and wellness space, we have an active database of 45,000+ teachers, schools, fitness professionals and educators who are actively trusting and consuming everything we create. A recommendation from us to this audience will activate thousands of teachers and schools as users.\n\nAmong these people we also have strong and reliable partnerships to further amplify reach and engagement beyond the Web3 universe. Offering free, engaging and ‚Äòcool‚Äô resources for kids‚Äô wellbeing is something these communities are hungry for.\n\nAdditionally our wellness podcast features interviews with olympians, human potential leaders, international sports personalities and even actors: Energetic Radio by Dale Sidebottom with 260 episodes, weekly releases and thousands of monthly listeners. We are also both regular speakers and have been on stages in 40+ countries. We will promote the app to our engaged social media channels and activate webinar style campaigns, so NOUNS can leverage our existing network and following.\n\nIn short it‚Äôs not our first rodeo, we are not a startup like many projects in the Web3 space. We are seeing a synergy between our experience, our existing client base and the Noun brand to elevate both for greater impact ‚Äì creating the foundations of the future world that Web3 stands for and ideas this project believes in.\n\nWe also aim to place Nouns at the forefront of supporting the Web3 community who are battling with extreme emotions of the daily game of NFT‚Äôs and Crypto.\n\nBeyond this scope we believe Nouns could have wider appeal to the global issue of declining health and wellness. We see Nouns Wellness as contributing toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Number 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.\n\nWho‚Äôs Creating It?\nWe‚Äôre two dads from Australia, and we are also two highly successful Web2 startup founders who have been in crypto since 2017. Together we have built over 100 mobile apps for clients and our own inhouse projects.\n\nJarrod Robinson - Ex PE Teacher/entrepreneur who has built numerous successful startups in the software/web space. These include ConnectedPE, the worlds leading professional development for PE teachers that directly trains 10,000+ PE Teachers yearly - He has also presented face to face in 40+ countries inspiring educators to utilise emerging technologies in their practice.\n\nDale Sidebottom - Dale is a full-time ‚Äòplay‚Äô consultant who taps into his 20+ years working in the education and fitness sectors to educate individuals, schools, sporting clubs and corporate organisations globally on the benefits ‚Äòadult play‚Äô can have on mental health and wellbeing. Dale is the author of All Work No Play, TEDx speaker and the top rating ‚ÄòEnergetic Radio‚Äô podcast.\n\nWorth Mentioning: A Few Successful Apps Built by the Team\nThese apps below were built by the core team who will create Nouns Wellness. Please note our skill set and connection to the topic of wellness, health & education at a truly global scale.\n\nConnectedPE\n\n\n1600√ó1179 327 KB\n\nMerryBody\n\n\n1200√ó1600 95.1 KB\n\nOK Got It, But Who‚Äôs Creating the Actual Content? (And Will It Be Any Good?)\nThe core wellness content with play methodology will be developed by Dale Sidebottom founder of Jugar Life and the Fitness Game Zone project. Content curriculum will be based on existing and proven programs used by over 10,000 health and wellness professionals.\n\nAdditional experts and partners of ours in the wellness and marketing space will be brought into the project, verbal agreements already underway.\n\nMerrymaker Sisters 1 - Online Yoga, Pilates and Meditation Studio.\nSavvy Copy - Conversion-focused copywriting agency - Some clients include: Gary Goldstein - Producer of Box Office Hit Pretty Woman, Sylvester Stallone, Roger Love (Hollywood Vocal Coach), Grace Lever + Web 3 Projects (under NDA).\nWorld Class Design Team - Has worked with the likes of Yoda (Frank oz), Jordan Harbinger, Bill Zanker, Perry Marshall, John Dwyer, Tony Robbins, Pitbull + Web 3 Projects (Under NDA)\nSo What Exactly Do You Mean By Bringing Play to Wellness?\nOver a decade, we have developed hundreds of hours of engaging wellness content based on the principles of play and games.\n\nTo outline the kinds of unique content you will find in Nouns Wellness App:\n\nJournal based engagement with daily questions incorporating play\nWritten, and professionally filmed videos\nGuided Meditations\nYoga Workouts\nPlay and Connection Games\nWellbeing Challenges\nFun Fitness Games\nHealthy Meals\nStory based movement adventures\nStory based meditations\nAny Early Visual Sneak Peaks You Can Share?\n\n\n1600√ó571 742 KB\n\nWhat Is the Timeline for the Rollout?\nAPP BUILD + LAUNCH - 6 Months (iOS and Android)\n\nRoadmap:\n\nApp Development - for iOS and Android\nWebsite Design/Landing Page - Design & Copywriting\nPre Launch Campaign - Social Media, Email, Partnerships\nLaunch Campaign - Social Media, Email, Partnerships, Podcast, Press Release\nMarketing and Awareness - Ongoing on all channels\nEducation/Training Resources - In website and app\nDedicated Podcast Episodes - Ongoing\nBudget for Nouns Wellness iOS + Android App\n100 ETH for design, dev, deployment & maintenance of the Nouns Wellness iOS & Android apps\n30 ETH for project management and outreach to partners\n40 ETH for initial content creation from wellness professionals\n30 ETH for copy, website design & marketing/promotions\nPayment to be made to the project multi-sig wallet\n\nTotal funding: 200 ETH\n\nDo You Foresee Adding Future Phases?\nYES. We are setting out to build a brand for the long term. This mobile app can be a launching pad for a multifaceted product rollout in the wellness and mental health space. As mentioned, positioning Nouns as THE wellness companion for young people globally. Once the app is launched and the Nouns Wellness brand is established, opportunities immediately become available for maximum impact. And we are ready to lead this expansion.\n\nOutline of Additional Phases:\n\nApp Gamification - Rewards, points, challenges, leader boards, community, avatar badges and wearables.\nWeb3 Community Engagement - Partnering with other DAOs to bring this to Web3 Community.\nExtensive Content Expansion - This is one curriculum piece of a much larger curriculum rollout.\nMulti Channel Product and Media Development - Can be so much more than an app.\nNoun Brand Proliferation - Global mapped Noun Wellness Curriculum.\nFuture Growth Initiatives - Global delivery and additional languages.\nBenefits to Nouns\nNouns in the Hearts and Minds of a New Audience\nKids everywhere in the world will have a Noun as their wellness avatar and profile picture in the app. Created from the Noun Playground they will personally identify with their Noun.\n\nNouns Mean Goodwill and Real Wellness Impact\nOur aim is that Nouns = Wellbeing and Healthy Living. Connecting with young people at a time when they are curious and open to learning new things. Endorsed by schools and having a measurable impact in the education space.\n\nNouns Serving the Web3 Community in Mental Health Management\nBy making this app available for free and leading with a crypto native brand a natural affinity is present in the community. This boosts Nouns further into becoming an engaging and loved brand.\n\nNouns are the First Point of Contact to Web3 for the Next Generation\nA section in the app will be dedicated to sharing the story of Nouns, Web3, NFTs, and the DAO to introduce the conversation and spark further discovery. Helping to open the adoption of Web3 in a natural and organic way.\n\nNouns Brand Awareness in the Real World\nThe real world use of Nouns in an established sector like education and wellness, especially with kids, is a solid and exciting way to fortify brand value and longevity.\n\nHow Will You Be Providing Project Updates?\nAll updates will happen in the Nouns Discord Channel and milestone related Medium Articles.\n\nIn Conclusion - Nouns to the Rescue\nMental health and taking care of yourself in Web3 is something that people talk about on Twitter and in Discords, but is anything meaningful really taking place?\n\nNouns can be at the forefront of helping kids everywhere who are battling with extreme emotions of daily life growing up in an uncertain world. This app will also empower the Nouns community and help thousands of others in the Web 3 space.\n\nThis is our chance as Nouns to help everyone who may feel trapped, lost or just have no idea where to start. This is our chance to change the game and save lives.",

      "content": "# NounsDAO Brazil\n\n# tl;dr\nBuild a community to nounify Brazil ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n \n# Description\n \nNounsDAO Brazil seeks to introduce Nouns in the diverse cultural manifestations that provide identity and tell the story of our country. Therefore, we want to connect local artists and builders, aiming to create and proliferate Nouns, and collaborate with established Brazilian brands for merch collabs. It is also crucial to onboard those who might not be able to overcome language barriers by distributing content and organizing events in the native language, Portuguese. With that in mind, we are proposing Nouns Week, an event in four capital cities. Our web content can also reach people living in eight other countries besides Brazil. Over 260 million people (3.7% of the world's population) speak Portuguese, the fourth most used language after Mandarin, English, and Spanish.\n\n# What have we done so far? (track record)\n\n1. A contest on NounsDAO Brazil Twitter to nounify Brazilian symbols and memes, offering a prize to three winners. There were 23 submissions, great engagement and a lot of fun. \n![Winners](https://i.postimg.cc/4yXBpKcv/Cqr-Fl-Dd-Imgur.jpg)\n2. Three proposals approved via Prop House:\n- 100 nounish hoodies for homeless people\n![Hoodies](https://i.postimg.cc/FsdD3QdB/cbn-Dz-Ml-Imgur.jpg)\n- 20 Twitter covers for 20 nouns projects \n![Prop House cover](https://i.postimg.cc/hv98ZKLD/x-Nx-Nuvh-Imgur.jpg)\n- Nouns OS as an entire Operating System Nouns-Themed for All Things Nouns\n![Nouns OS](https://i.postimg.cc/zGdYdgFf/Nouns-OS-Desk-Blue-Sample.png)\n3. In a month about 400 Twitter followers at NounsDAO Brazil account. \n4. In a week around 100 people are in NounsDAO Brazil discord.\n \n# What do we want to do?\n\n1. Nouns Week Brazil: guerrilla marketing actions to nounify four cities in different regions of the country, with a combined population of over 26 million people.\n2. Community: maintain an active Twitter and Discord with an open conversation about new ideas and community needs.\n3. NounsDAO grants: guide the Brazilian community on how to write and submit projects for small grants, prop house and nouns proposals.

Noun heads contest: start an art contest on NounsDAO Brazil Twitter to create noun heads with Brazilian motives, offering 2 ETH prize split among 3 winners. \n5. Twitter spaces: regular Twitter spaces held in Portuguese to spread awareness, and special spaces in English to give this community access to guests that don't speak Portuguese. \n6. Website: create and launch NounsDAO Brazil website.\n7. Merch collabs: contact well-established Brazilian brands like [Havaianas](https://havaianas.com.br/), [Melissa](https://www.melissa.com.br/), and [Hering](https://www.hering.com.br/) for a collaboration using noggles in the product's design. \n![Havaianas](https://i.postimg.cc/QdCpT26y/havaianas-cidade-840x577.jpg)\n![Melissa](https://i.postimg.cc/2543bTft/Melissa-x-Karl-Lagerfeld.jpg)\n![Hering](https://i.postimg.cc/bNWvm4yM/hering.jpg)\n\n# Nouns Week Brazil\n\nWe are planning a Nouns week in October 2022 with simultaneous nounification of four capital cities from north to south of Brazil.

The four main areas that will be invited to take part in this year COMEX would be:\n\n* Social-Fi\n* DeFi\n* GameFi\n* NFTs\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2zXDZVL.jpg)\n\n**LOCATION:**\n\nAs Singapore has been listed as the top few countries most interested in NFTs/Web3 Technology, with a monthly search volume of 18,717 per one million in population. COMEX have allocated a prime location for NFT/Crypto at this year event, which is directly at the entrance of Hall 401-402 (the very first hall).\nThis ensure that the space get maximum foot traffic from the whole event.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UnJEnkv.jpg)\n\n**WHAT IS NOUNS BOOTH?**\n\nIt will be a IRL experience at COMEX Singapore to spread Nouns to a wider audience, both crypto/NFTs native and not. It‚Äôs a IRL brand recognition that aims to create authentic and memorable user connection. It will serve as an activation, a proliferation pod to grow the Singapore Nouns community; to onboard new contributors.\n\n**DETAILS ‚åê‚óß-‚óß**\n\nNouns Booth @ COMEX Singapore will be an experience for visitors where they will be able to understand Nouns by engaging with the booth. The booth serves as an activation and brand recognition that consists of at least 5 engagement points. By interacting with the booth, visitors not only get to understand what Nouns is but also stand a chance to win themselves some Nounish goodie which helps to solidify the brand recognition. The engagement points are designed to instill a memorable user connection to Nouns.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gv2rAvp.gif)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/oWSRjTn.jpg)\n\n**TYPES OF INTERACTIONS**\n\n**1.

I will be tapping into WEB3SG presence; one of the largest NFT twitter community in Singapore for this activation/promotion of Nouns Booth @ COMEX Singapore\n\n**FUNDS BREAKDOWN**\n|Description|Cost in USD*|Cost in ETH**|Cost in ETH***|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|COMEX booth (4x Days activation)<br><br> Includes:<br> - Designing of booth, having a feature wall<br> for photo opportunity<br> - Setting up / Tearing down / Dispoal <br> - 1x Information counter<br> - 1x TV screen to display live auction<br> - 2x display of Nouns @ COMEX virtual gallery<br> - 2x display of Nouns @ Artnow gallery<br>- 1x Tweet by WEB3SG to promote Nouns Booth<br>- 1x Twitter space to promote Nouns Booth|12,000|10.00|7.50|\n|Noggle Stickers (5,000pcs)|500|0.42|0.31|\n|Pins (1,000pcs)|1,500|1.25|0.94|\n|Tote Bags (500pcs)|900|0.75|0.56|\n|Brochure (2500pcs)|200|0.17|0.13|\n|Socks (500pcs)|800|0.67|0.50|\n|Shirt (500 pcs)|1,900|1.58|1.19|\n|Operations:<br> - 2x manpower for 4 days|4,000|3.33|2.50|\n|Transportation|300|0.25|0.19|\n|Total|22,100|18.42|13.81|\n<!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n\n*Base on local vendor price converted to USD\n**Considering an ETH avg. price of 1,200 USD due to possible fluctuations\n***Considering current ETH avg. price of 1,600 USD\n\n**SUMMARY**\nThis will be a great opportunity to create a Nounish IRL experience which is spread across 4 days of activation at one of the largest most anticipated annual event in Singapore; an opportunity to have Nouns branding reach out to a wider audience. \n\nAs COMEX is held on 1-4th Sep, this gives me a timeline of around 1 month. If proposal is able to pass and fund received within this week, majority of the funds will be converted to fiat as outlay for manufacturing Nounish goodies, remaining funds will be transfer to WEB3SG (ETH) as payment for the booth space at COMEX. I have already designed and created the files for the booth, thus I can pass them to WEB3SG who will manufacture and erect the booth. I will focus on overseeing the process as well as focusing on execution and administrative work prior to COMEX. \n\n\n**LONG TERM GOAL**\nI will continue to grow Nouns Singapore community under @nounsinsg, with Nouns Booth as the initiate activation. Nounsinsg will serve as a proliferation pod, guidance and point of contact for new contributor as well as creating more IRL Nounish experience in the future. Similar to Aubtoshi, a personal long-term goal is to officially be a Nouner. Until then, I will continue to proliferate Nouns in ways that are fun and effective that I can make possible. A IRL activation that I've been working on would be \"NOUNISH BEACH CLEAN UP' which was passed and supported by SMALL GRANT. (Thank you @noun22) It is scheduled on 13th Aug 2022, you may find more info and update on the event below. \n\nI want to thank all Nouners in advance for giving me the chance to contribute and proliferate Nouns together! \n\n**Transactions**\nGiven the time sensitivity of this proposal, the transaction embedded will send 15 ETH to the Small Grants multi-sig.  If this proposal seems likely to pass in early voting, Small Grants will release the funds to the proposer a few days in advance of the proposal being queued and executed.",

The remaining ETH was held in a Gnosis until samples were delivered and the tooling was complete. \n \nEarly May Klim cashed out: \n5E at ~$3,029 (4/17) = 15,145 \n5E at ~$2,930 = 14,650 \n10 at ~$2,450 = 24,200 \nTotal = ~53,995 USDC (would have been 57,000 if cashed out right way) \n \nAfter this, while the funds were in the Gnosis the price of ETH dropped significantly and we began discussing what we should do for creators needing USD to complete projects moving forward. We saw an example with Prop 73 where the funds were converted to USDC. We landed on this being a good path forward.  We continued to discuss balances needed to complete projects before this precedent was set. \n \nFor Klim the remaining ETH was held in a Gnosis Safe while tooling was completed and samples were made. He delivered his product on time as promised. He incurred additional expenses for rush fees and shipping on samples that were sent to Austin & NYC. He is now ready for production but the funds are short. \n \nWhile tooling was being created and the price of ETH dropped significantly I was not comfortable making any decisions with the DAO‚Äôs funds independently. I began having multiple conversations within the DAO to discuss how to finish this Prop and the best path forward.  It seemed that converting the balance in the Gnosis to USDC was the best move while we figured out how to treat the remaining funds needed to complete the Prop.  On July 8th I made a Swap for the remaining 35ETH to USDC and sent 42,163 USDC to Klim.  \n \nThe total needed to finish this project is $116,000 of which Klim has $42,000. He needs an additional $74,000 (~50ETH on 7/19/22) and deliver:\n\n5000 pcs Incl. 500 GOLD NOUNDER GIFTS:\n3500 RED\n500 BLACK \n500 WHITE\n500 CHROME GOLD -exclusive to NOUN holders \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyS2Os4hq.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk2ndiNh9.png)\n\nOther Bigshot Nounworks Project: \nPins \n3ETH \nMade 5K Pins that are available for distribution.

      "content": "# Nouns DAO at FWB FEST \n\n**TLDR**\nThis August, the Friends with Benefits community will be hosting [FWB FEST](https://fest.fwb.help), a three day immersive conference and festival to discuss the current state of how Web3 is affecting culture. \n\nOver forty keynote talks, performances, and sessions have been programmed by the community to take place over this 72 hour symposium. FWB is looking for support from Nouns DAO to publicly amplify these conversations to the wider Web3 community and beyond, under CC0 and a content distribution partnership. \n\nAdditionally, we‚Äôd like to use this as an opportunity to craft a culturally oriented session around Nouns DAO at the conference, while bridging our communities together through this DAO-to-DAO collaboration. \n\n**Who We Are**\nFriends with Benefits is a worldwide group of creators, thinkers, and builders who sit at the intersection of Web3 and culture. As one of the earliest social token communities, FWB‚Äôs members span a diverse range from the heavily crypto native to the more recently, and eagerly, onboarded. \n\n**Introducing FWB FEST**\nBetween August 12-14, 2022, FWB will be hosting the inaugural [FWB FEST](https://fest.fwb.help) in Idyllwild, California to bring together our global community to discuss how Web3 will continue to shape the future of culture. \n\nThe FWB community aims to grow FWB FEST into a premier conference that annually showcases leading topics and conversations around how Web3 is affecting culture. \n\n*FWB FEST will:*\n* Gather ~500 community members IRL \n* Livestream the event to thousands more digitally \n* Take over the historic 200+ acre campus of the Idyllwild Arts Academy in the San Jacinto Mountains outside of Los Angeles\n* Feature a world class speaking and music lineup including:\n\nPerformances: James Blake, Pussy Riot, Oneohtrix Point Never, L‚ÄôRain, Weyes Blood, Mustafa, and more \n\nSpeakers: Hayden Adams (Uniswap), Nadya Tolokonnikova (Pussy Riot, Unicorn DAO), David Rudnick, Meltem DeMirors, Glen Wyl (Radical Exchange, DeSoc), Toby Shorin (Other Internet), Kei Kreutler (Gnosis), Yancey Strickler (Metalabel, Kickstarter) & More\n\nFull lineup [here](https://fest.fwb.help/).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JLnuCD7.jpg) \n\n\n\n\n**How can we partner?**\n\n**FWB FEST Content Co-Brand and Distribution** \nFWB, with support from Nouns, will capture and record the keynote talks from FWB FEST and make these talks publicly accessible to the world under CC0 through concise video formats. All talks would include Nouns DAO logo placement.\n\nKeynote sample conversations at FWB FEST include:\n\n*Cultural Currency*\nNadya Tolokonnikova (PussyRiot, Unicorn DAO), Hayden Adams (Founder, Uniswap), Trevor McFedries (Brud & FWB)\n\n*Future of Identity & Soul Bound Tokens*\nGlen Weyl (Author, Radical Markets), Christopher Kulendran Thomas (Founder, EARTH), Puja Ohlhaver (Researcher)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Hxr1GRg.jpg)\n\n\n**Nouns DAO Keynote Talk at FWB FEST** \nFWB will organize a keynote talk with and about Nouns, giving people a chance to contextualize Nouns in both an IRL and a thought leadership context. This talk would be crafted in collaboration with Nouns holders to ensure proper representation and storytelling, and would be crafted in collaboration with Jacob Horne and other outspoken Nouners.\n\nThe keynote talk will be hosted live at FWB FEST in front of an audience of ~500 guests, and will be recorded, edited, and distributed as one of the highlighted talks at FWB FEST. \n\nThe main objective will be to contribute public content about Nouns DAO that is tasteful, personable, culturally aligned, and encapsulates a different perspective than the current existing Youtube explainer video formats.\n\n\n**Hosting Nouns DAO on NFT Pirate Radio** \nAs part of this strategy we would also invite Nouns representatives to speak on our most popular digital program, NFT Pirate Radio. \n\nNFT Pirate Radio is presented in collaboration with OpenSea on Twitter Spaces and averages 2,000+ live listeners for each episode. Previous guests of Pirate Radio show include: David Choe, Aaron Penne, Mindy Seu, Andrew Benson, Vivian Fu & Noah Kalina (JPEG2000), and Possessed. \n\nAll NFT Pirate Radio sessions are also recorded and will eventually live as evergreen assets to be further amplified. \n\n**FWB Works in Progress**\nLastly, we would commission a writer within the FWB community to meaningfully tell a story about why Nouns DAO represents an interesting model for brand proliferation via a long-form written piece on FWB Works in Progress, our editorial platform. \n\nPast pieces WIP include:\nWhat Co-Ops and DAOs Can Learn From Each Other by Austin Robey which has garnered 300,000+ impressions. \n\nIn addition to the media strategy above, FWB would integrate Nouns DAO in a few other ways.\n\n**Recognition as official partner of FWB FEST** \nAs an official partner, Nouns branding would be included on the FWB FEST website as well as the FWB newsletter, social media accounts, FEST promotional assets, and on-site guide. \n\n\n**Nouns DAO Ticket Raffle for Nouns Community** \nNouns DAO to receive 10 FWB.FEST NFT tickets to raffle off and give away to Noun community members. \n\n**Why?** \nWe believe this is a meaningful initiative for the Nouns community because it will:\n\n* Democratize and distribute the keynote talks and conversations at FWB FEST for the entire Web3 community to consume, irrespective of location and travel ability.\n* Contribute effective storytelling and thought leadership about Nouns DAO with a cultural perspective and lens \n* Leverage FWB FEST with its high concentration of web3 native and culturally aligned community members. \n* Utilize additional FWB distribution channels like Pirate Radio and FWB Works in Progress to further amplify Nouns storytelling from a cultural perspective \n* Create an initial playbook that Nouns can use to further collaborate with other DAOs\n* Support FWB in its endeavor to create a premier conference and festival experience bridging Web3 and Culture\n\n\n**Funds Requested** \n30 ETH | Video Production Team: Equipment, Labor, Time, Housing, Travel, and Editing\n30 ETH  Stage Production, Lighting, Sound, Venue, and Hard Costs\n10 ETH | FWB FEST Tickets for NounsDAO\n5 ETH | FWB Editorial Commission\n5 ETH | FWB Pirate Radio Nouns Talk Production\n\nTotal: 80 ETH\n\nAll deliverables will be executed between FWB FEST (August 12-14) and September 30th, accounting for proper editing, marketing, and distribution time. \n\n**Who Is Behind This Proposal?**\n\nMembers of the FWB Community & Team Including:\nGabe Quintela, Partnerships\nLindsay Howard, Curatorial & Brand\nAlex Zhang, Mayor\nPaul Tao, Events, Operations\nZach Tetreault, Programming \n& More\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QE0WmMP.jpg)\n\n\n*Relevant Links*\n[FWB FEST Website](https://fest.fwb.help) \n[NYT Feature on FWB](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/technology/friends-with-benefits-crypto-dao.html)\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/FWBtweets) \n[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/fwbcollection/?hl=en) \n",

      "content": "# Descriptor V2 Upgrade\n\nThis proposal activates a new version of the Nouns Descriptor contract, which contains many improvements upon the previous version. The Descriptor is the contract that stores and renders Noun artwork and token metadata.\n\n**Descriptor Improvements**:\n\n* Significantly cheaper on-chain art deployment, which largely benefits builders that fork the Nouns protocol. The gas required to deploy the Nouns artwork has been reduced nearly 5x.\n* Improved external API, which boosts composability by allowing external contracts to more easily hook into the Noun artwork and rendering engine.\n* Improved descriptor upgradability. The new descriptor separates the artwork, renderer, and facilitator contracts, which enable much cheaper upgrades (e.g. trait retirement).\n\n**Note**: This proposal is separate from the 8/8 art additions, which will be proposed separately in the coming weeks.\n\n* [Specification](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-tech/blob/main/descriptor-v2/README.md)\n* [Pull Request](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/pull/499)\n\nThis code has been reviewed by multiple technical community members, has unit/integration test coverage, and has been tested on both Rinkeby and Mainnet.\n\nIn addition, we‚Äôve retroactively fixed seven art errors and oversights. These fixes will not only apply to art moving forward, but will reach back in time to correct Nouns that contain the offending traits. All fixes are either recoloring of existing pixels or removing of extra pixels. Most errors are likely a result of iteration and palette color reduction prior to the launch of Nouns - some that melded two colors into one, or put two formerly-different colors closer to one another. No pixels are being added in this update. Emoji voting in discord indicated support for this effort.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SSAquuV.png)\n\n**Piggybank**: Removal of cluster of erroneous pixels around the tail region.\n\nReason for error: Oversight.\n\n**Beer**: There are several pixels that are only slightly off in color. They've been filled in with the correct color so it's all one full-bodied beer.\n\nReason for error: Weirdness created by palette color reduction.\n\n**Multicolored glasses**: There are inconsistent rules applied to this trio of frames, resulting in a distracting appearance from one to the next. Additionally, this fix helps retain the frame shape unless they're going to blend into the head, which is an anomaly.\n\nReason for error: Oversight.\n\n**Watermelon frames**: These were the same color as the Guava frames. This pushes them into riper, melony territory.\n\nReason for error: Likely palette crushing creating weirdness.\n\n**Fog Grey body**: This was the same color as CRT beige. This pushes it into foggier, greyer territory.\n\nReason for error: Weirdness created by palette color reduction.\n\nPlease reach out in the [#54-tech-grants](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/981584123225321503) channel in Discord with any questions ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®",

      "content": "Should SharkDAO put On-Chain and vote FOR at NounsDAO the following proposal:\n\nTl;dr\nA monthly cc0 Nouns comic for Nationwide Distribution.\n\n*link to the same info but with pictures!\nhttps://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/monthly-nouns-comics-for-mass-market-release-v2/1717\n\nAn initial 6-issue series would be commissioned for a total of $210,000 USD, paid for by selling 7,000 copies of each issue with an exclusive cover to NounsDAO, to be distributed (or sold) as seen fit. The money will be used to pay for all the creatives as well as ensure the work is owned by NounsDAO (both writing and artwork).\nThe team, led by DefaultedUser, a 25-year veteran of comics publishing, will create a comic meant to be released not only to the Web3 community but to comic book stores via Titan Comics and to book stores via Penguin Random House.\nThe Community will be allowed to vote on aspects of the publishing project starting in July 2022, with the first issue to release to the community in November 2022, and the mass market in March 2023.\nAfter issue #6, profits will be used to publish future issues, still with community involvement, as well as fund other Nouns related publishing projects.\n\nIntroduction\nComics have been an art form for over 100 years now, in many ways overtaking novels as the most important written form of creativity for society, and defining Intellectual Property more than Film or Television. Comics have the advantage of a monthly (in some cases) publishing cycle, are able to pump out more content than other mediums, and so are able to connect with a dedicated audience more frequently, as well as generating more stories than other mediums.\n\nComic Books have brought us Spider-man, Superman, Batman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Uncle Scrooge, Garfield, The Far Side, and quite literally tens of thousands more. Nouns is a visual creation, with much room for growth. The dedicated fanbase mimics that of core comic book publications of the past, giving the space and time to grow and be recognized by the worldwide community as a whole.\n\nI have worked in the comic book industry for 25 years now, acting in various roles, but most notably as a publisher for various companies (Including Boom! Studios), as well as creating comics for properties such as Divinity: Original Sin 2, Transformers, Farscape, Warhammer, Warhammer 40K, Mickey Mouse, Frozen, Pixar, Pirates of the Caribbean, Spider-man, Thor, Star Wars, and many others.\n\nIn licensing, one is required to work within certain parameters, while creating a compelling product. This will serve me well when creating Nouns product, being able to listen to the community and create something appealing for the community, while also something that can be successful outside of it.\n\nI have extensive knowledge of how to create compelling content and have a publishing and distribution agreement with Titan books (and through them Penguin Random House), so can focus on making this product physical in nature, and not just a digital offering, as well as something that will see Nouns splashed all over thousands of stores.\n\nUtilize comics to generate constant content, keep the community engaged.\nDevelop stories, worlds, and characters that give more sandboxes for the community and other creatives within the community to play with.\nBring Nouns to the ‚ÄúMass Market‚Äù (Comic book stores, book stores, big box stores, book clubs, libraries). Gives legitimacy to the IP, and expands the potential community.\nCommunity Driven Support\nNouns is famously known for its treasury, often used to create interesting projects that further the Nouns ecosystem. What we are proposing is to engage and encourage the community to support the project, creating a financial model that isn‚Äôt solely dependent upon a treasury, and using that to expand the area and influence of NounsComics.\n\nMuch like Kickstarter, IndieGogo and Substack have used a model that allows early supporters to get exclusive items, while also funding projects that they have an interest in, and so too will NounsComics. The first engagement is to the Web3 community, as well as the Nouns community, offering access to exclusive comics, covers, and finally the ability to vote as a community on artists and authors, story beats, and covers.\n\nThe initial project will be a six issue comic book, along with a graphic novel release. NounsComics will pre-sell this series, in individual segments. The initial offerings will be:\n\nIndividual issues for sale, as well as the graphic novel (as a package)\nA minimum order of 7,000 copies for sale, which will give an individual or community the chance to commission a special cover of the comic book, which will then be only available to them, to be distributed as they see fit (sold, given away, stored, etc.)\nSales of graded copies of the individual comics, to be graded and placed on the blockchain for them via an NFT once the book has been printed. The specific grade is out of 10, with 10 being absolutely perfect in every way (and is almost impossible to attain), so the grades will be at LEAST 9.6, with the final grade being between 9.6 ‚Äì 10, randomized.\nIndividual comics are priced at $5.00 USD dynamic value\nThe Graphic novel is offered at $30.00 USD dynamic value\nThe graded comics will be offered for $250.00 USD dynamic value\nEvery purchase not only helps fund the project, but will also give the purchaser the right to vote on certain aspects of the comic book series. The individual things that can be voted on are :\n\nThe story concept and writer of the project. We will offer a minimum of 3 choices at the outset, prior to the project going on pre-sale. Each of these concepts and writers will be vetted, to ensure to plagiarism, as well as the ability to deliver a commercially viable product.\nThe art style and artist of the project. A minimum of 3 art styles and artists are made available for a range of options. Each of the artists will be vetted to make certain they are capable of delivering a product that will be entertaining, engaging and finally released on a timely basis! Two different styles for publishing are included below.\n\nWhich Nouns will be in the comic series. We will want to make sure that those that pre-purchase the series get to suggest and vote for various Nouns, with the top voted not only appearing in the comic series, but also having the Nouns owner engaged to create the voice and personality of the Noun appearing in the comic series.\nFor every single comics cover there will be at minimum 3 concept sketches provided, with votes choosing which one becomes the final cover. The same process will be used for the graphic novel.\nAll funds raised in this manner will be kept in a multi-sig wallet, with funds being released to move the project along, specific amounts for each portion of comic creation and issue.\n\nSo, a specific number will be released for the script to be completed for issue #1. After that is approved, a specific amount will be released for the layout of issue #1. After this, an amount will be released for the pencils to be finished for issue #1. Finally, the remaining sum allotted for issue #1 will be released for Colours and Letters of Issue #1. The same process will be repeated for Issues #2-6. In this manner we can keep progress moving in a timely manner, making sure that there are incentives to create the content quickly, but also doing as good a job as possible.\n\nAs the issues are completed, profits (if there are any) will be split in this manner : Payment of 25% of the profits to the publisher of the series. 25% of the profits to the NounsDAO Treasury itself. 40% will be held by NounsComics to keep the series running, and potentially fund new series down the road, and finally 10% to ComicsDAO, who will be onboarding the writers, artists and community members for votes and sales.\n\nWe use the community to fund and engage with the project\nWe pay back to the community with the success of the project\nThere are various onboarding points to the project that can make the community feel invested, choosing which Nouns appear, the feel and style of the project\nAs this project is printed, it will also be sold into comic book stores (and book stores in the case of the graphic novel). This can allow those not familiar with the Nouns community to see what it is capable of, and gives them a simple yet effective point to become engaged themselves. We have a publishing deal for both markets with major publishers, which is how we will accomplish this, NOT through independent publication.\nProfit and Loss\nJust some general calculations for the project :\n\nIf we assume a creative cost for the project of $210,000 USD for the six issue series (broken down as $35,000 USD per issue), we would need roughly 7,500 copies of each book sold to pay for printing and creative.\nIf we achieve 10,000 copies sold per issue, along with 200 copies sold of the physically graded comics, the financials would look like this :\n\nRevenues : $675,000 USD\nExpenses: $330,000 USD (this includes creative, printing and grading)\n25% to NounsDAO : $86,250 USD\n25% to Publisher : $86,250 USD\n40% to NounsComics : $138,000 USD\n10% to ComicsDAO : $34,500 USD\nFinancial Breakdown\n\nPer issue Cost\n\nPencils : $8,000 USD\n\nScript : $3,000 USD\n\nInks : $3,000 USD\n\nColours : $5,000 USD\n\nLetters : $1,000 USD\n\nEditing/Scheduling/Management : $10,000 USD\n\nBonus for completing book on schedule : $5,000 USD\n\nTotal cost per Issue : $35,000 USD\n\nSchedule\n\nUpon execution of proposal : $40,000 USD to publisher.\n\nAugust, 2022 : Post images for covers to issue #1, open up comics for sale, provide detailed artwork for voting, as well as detailed story outlines for voting.\n\nSeptember, 2022 : Artist, writers and other voting elements will be finished, and work will begin on issue #1.\n\n$40,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nNovember, 2022 : Issue #1 complete, Issue #2 & #3 written.\n\nSolicitation submitted for sale into comic book stores (for February, 2023 release in stores). Sneak preview available to all who pre-purchased the book.\n\nUpon completion of Issue #1, $40,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nDecember, 2022 : Issue #2 complete, Issue #3 penciled, Issue #4 & #5 written.\n\nUpon completion of Issue #2, $40,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nJanuary, 2023 : Issue #3 complete, Issue #4 penciled, Issue #6 written.\n\nUpon completion of Issue #3, $50,000 USD released to publisher.\n\nFebruary, 2023 : Issue #4 complete, Issue #1 is available for sale in comic book stores across North America and Europe. Pre-ordered books will also be shipped to individuals that placed an order for them. Books that were ordered as graded will be sent off to CGC in order to be graded.\n\nMarch, 2023 : Issue #5 completed. Issue #2 is available for sale in comic book stores across North America and Europe. Same process with pre-ordered books, as well as books ordered as graded. Graded copies of Issue #1 will be shipped to individuals that ordered the book.\n\nApril, 2023 : Issue #6 completed. Issue #3 is available for sale in all relevant places, same with pre-ordered books, etc.\n\nSeptember, 2023 : Graphic novel for the series will be available in book stores throughout North America and Europe.\n\nMulti-Signature Wallet\n\nA wallet with signatures from DefaultedUser, JoshuaFisher and SharkDAO will be used to hold the funds that are released from NounsDAO, as well as sales from all books to individuals and communities. Sales from physical copies and stores will see the money placed in this wallet as well, after the expenses are removed by the Publisher (sales, printing, distribution, etc.)\n\nAll expenses will be itemized and available upon request online, to ensure that the wallet will contain the appropriate amount of money at all times.\n\n25% profits to NounsDAO\n\nThe goal will be to make this a profitable endeavour in order to not just perpetuate published projects for the Nouns community, but to also generate revenues for the Nouns, in return for the initial support, concept generation, and paying back to the community. This will be achieved by placing 25% of the profits in a separate wallet, to be used to purchase Nouns. This will place the money back into the Treasury, and allow us to place additional publishing and content creation proposals ourselves, along with giving us a voice in our ability to vote on initiatives that we are supportive of.\n\nConclusion\nWith this approach, we can engage with the community, incentivize them to participate, and also grow the ecosystem beyond Web3. Until there is an easy onboarding process for the non-Web3 natives, Nouns cannot grow beyond this space. This might seem like an obstacle to overcome, but in fact, it is an asset. Most projects start from zero, with no supportive community to support it, and encourage others to participate.\n\nWe will leave with one story, that illustrates how dangerous no community is, and how it can make or break a project. A comics creator named Jeff Smith published a book series called Bone way back in 1991. At the time, it was one of the few black and white comics, didn‚Äôt have the monthly schedule that buyers liked, and was completely different from what was being published at the time. Jeff has commented repeatedly in later years that he nearly canceled the series numerous times within the first 10 issues. It was a very small community that supported his early works and allowed him to keep publishing (55 issues between 1991 and 2004). As the series continued on, it grew in fame and prestige, until in 2005 it was picked up by Scholastic books, and released through their new imprint. At this time it is one of the highest selling graphic novel series of all time, beating out all the superhero releases since the 1940‚Äôs to present day.\n\nWithout a supportive community, this project wouldn‚Äôt see the light of day, nor be given the space to continue and finally achieve the great success it deserves. The Nouns community can allow the same to happen with NounsComics, giving any project created a chance to grow and incubate until the world has a chance to enjoy it.\n\nSend $210,000.00 ETH equivalent to Gnosis Safe to be converted into stable coins.

Allow us to introduce ourselves‚Ä¶\n\n[![Ordinary Folk Reel](https://i.imgur.com/LV2e5A7.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M7osmhGv5v4HIvtN321pnJa1EXrdTY4J/view?)\n\nüíª You can see more of our work [here](http://www.ordinaryfolk.co/work).\n \n\nWe‚Äôre a big fan of NFTs and explaining complex ideas ‚Äî simply and beautifully. We‚Äôve been doing it for a while with companies you may have heard of, and we‚Äôd like to do it for you.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe propose commissioning Ordinary Folk to create a 1-2 minute fully animated video. Explaining Nouns, how they work and why the community is so valuable.\n\n# But, why?\n\nWe know Nouns are awesome, but scrolling through all this? \n\nNot so awesome.\n\n![webNavGIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/YwFuI4outa3r6PYdlj/giphy.gif)\n\nA much better way to go through this information is with an animated explainer. Sure, we're biased, but the facts remain that explainers have the power to communicate complex and vast amounts of information in a short and entertaining way.\n\nWe think a project of this caliber deserves nothing but the best, and a clear explainer that explains the function and reason behind Nouns will really bring Nouns to more eyes, normies, and degens alike.\n\n# Summary\n\nOrdinary Folk would leverage our production expertise to manage, creative direct, storyboard, design, animate, and facilitate the composition of an original score, and voice-over recording for a Nouns animated explainer. The full production package.\n\n## Creative Commons\n\nAll of our deliverables will be CC0 with open source files.\n\n![webNavGIF](https://media.giphy.com/media/USgwvuKFBz60A7S5hY/giphy.gif)\n\n# Ordinary Folk‚Äôs Process\n\nWe trust the process, and ours is highly iterative and linear. Feedback will be managed differently than in other projects given the nature of the DAO, more specifically:\n\nWhen the project is executed, Ordinary Folk will build out a milestone schedule to send the DAO regular updates requesting specific feedback and guidance on the tone, voice, direction of the animation. \n\nAll Nouners and community will have the opportunity to comment for each work-in-progress in discord for 24 hours. How and if we apply the feedback will be up to our discretion and expertise.\n\nThat said, given the nature of the script writing process, we would ask that we can have at least 1 Nounder that we can have 2 or 3 script conversations with to make sure the messaging is exactly what it needs to be.\n\nStarting with the first concept review, Nouners and community are directly involved in developing the product in a tangible way and Ordinary Folk will guide and decide on how to execute the project for the best product.\n\nüí° From award to delivery, the process generally takes ~8 - 10 weeks\n\n\n\nHere‚Äôs an overview‚Ä¶\n\n---\n## Step 1: Scripting\n\nAnimation is a visual and audio storytelling medium but you always start with a good foundation ‚Äî the script. Messaging in animation is a balance of showing and telling. We'll first focus on having the script stand on its own while building a plan for the visuals and sound.\n\nüí° Scripting generally takes ~1 - 2 weeks\n\n## Storyboarding, Design, & Animation\n\nWhile we work on locking down the script and recording the voice-over, we‚Äôll also be working on creative direction, storyboards, design, sound, and animation. \n\nHere are a few examples of each step:\n\n## Step 2: Storyboarding\n\n![storyboard01](https://i.imgur.com/QQJnRUu.png)\n\n![storyboard02](https://i.imgur.com/ijYffAY.png)\n\n\n### Storyboarding Animatic\n\n[![Storyboard Animatic SOM](https://i.imgur.com/RJtPPY6.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KG9_dUej6qcWyWNZIO4cxG3nAh-Lt0g7/view?usp=sharing)\n*Storyboard Animatic for School of Motion.*\n\n## Step 3: Design / Styleframes\n\n![styleframe01](https://i.imgur.com/C1Yaf5o.jpg)\n![styleframe02](https://i.imgur.com/J3fwudv.jpg)\n![styleframe03](https://i.imgur.com/9VKwP1E.jpg)\n![styleframe04](https://i.imgur.com/Z6YEiEB.jpg)\n![styleframe05](https://i.imgur.com/4ibNpPg.jpg)\n![styleframe06](https://i.imgur.com/nmN8FNU.png)\n\n## Step 4: Animation\n\nThe process of animation is very intentional, tedious AND the most exciting phase when you begin to see elements from the designs come to life. \n\nWe'll send a series of videos showing our work in progress (WIP). WIPs may also come in the form of motion tests or a series of gifs. When we have enough motion compiled together we'll send videos that are a mix of still a motion to show our progress.\n\n![Rough Pencil Pass](https://media.giphy.com/media/SiEiGfR0MJiaARmtff/giphy.gif)=\n*Rough Pencil Pass.*\n\n![WIP Animation of the same shot](https://media.giphy.com/media/OsfGmba8n7AtXKjF4O/giphy.gif)\n*WIP Animation of the same shot.*\n\n### WIP Examples\n[![Twilio WIP Example](https://i.imgur.com/vhJT3gu.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j2pagFQM_anX-gkFjM-Lq_qOjHM1NlbC/view?usp=sharing)\n*Twilio WIP Example.*\n\n[![School of Motion WIP Example](https://imgur.com/vbvik4M.jpg)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h1GNwX7DqwD5vk0YCk2pRgLdsgZmUN6-/view?usp=sharing)\n*School of Motion WIP Example.*\n\n## Step 5: Sound\n\n### Voice Over\n\nWhen the script is locked we'll begin the casting for a VO actor. From there we'll have the actor record the script.\n\n### Score & SFX\n\nThe composer will begin scoring when we have a locked animatic with the final VO timing. We'll constantly be tweaking the score and animation to match and elevate each other.\n\nSound design (the process of adding sound effects) and sound mixing (adjusting the levels of the VO, score, and sound effects.) are the finishing touches of our projects. Adding a final level of polish to our work.\n\n# The final product\n\nHere are a few of our favorite pieces which may inspire our work with Nouns:\n\n[![Minima](https://imgur.com/kYoX9OY.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/691634099)\n*Minima*\n\n[![Webflow](https://imgur.com/EkjA6Vy.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/664409837)\n*Webflow*\n\n[![School of Motion](https://imgur.com/20aDMXs.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/360269073)\n*School of Motion*\n\n\n[![SAP](https://imgur.com/AGzRs5x.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/368584682)\n*SAP*\n\n\n# Technical Specs & Delivery\n\n### Specifications\n\nWe‚Äôve scoped this project with these specs:\n\n- 1x - 1 - 2 minute animation delivered in two renders optimized for web and prores.\n- Designed and mastered in 4K, 16:9, 30fps.\n- AE animation project files for CC0 use.\n\n# Pricing\n\n| Description | Pricing in ETH |\n| --- | --- |\n| Fees: Creative Direction, Design, Animation, AE Project Files for CC use | 115 ETH  |\n| Original Score | 8 ETH |\n| Voice-over | 2 ETH |\n**| GRAND TOTAL: | 125 ETH |**\n\nüí° Noun 347 will receive a finders fee of 7% of the total price\n\n\n---\n\n# Production Schedule\n\nIf executed, we‚Äôll deliver a production schedule of 8-10 weeks with a start date not to exceed September 1.\n\n---\n**Thank You!**\n![image alt](https://media.giphy.com/media/xKVASQrGgLX0rIjxpz/giphy.gif) ",

This is especially important when we have a milestone based payment structure. This was first implemented in Prop 73.\n\nConcerning Props 56 & 70 the DAO did not provide clear options that would allow the Proposer to choose how the milestone payments were held while also enforcing milestone based payment. In a sense they were forced to take the market risk without clear guidance on possible options.\n\nWe approached this Prop with the idea that we would pay slightly above fair market value, 60K, to produce 6 cc0 story bibles.\n\nTL:DR we need an additional ~38 ETH\n\nAgreement:\n$60,000 (20 ETH) to create cc0 Story Bibles.\n$18,000 (6 ETH) paid upon start May 2, 2022\n$6,800 (4ETH) paid to Person, Place, Things June 8, 2022\n\nBalance in Gnosis: $127,700 USDC\n\nDue to Creators:\n$42,000 is the balance due to 3 of 4 teams.\n$35,200 is due to Sam Ellis & Jason Schwarts / Person, Place, Thing Studios\n$161,200 = Total Due to 4 Teams\nNeed Roughly ~40 ETH* (will send any ETH back after conversion to USDC)\n\n*This Prop was designed for 6 teams, 1 of which was to be chosen from submissions.

      "content": "# Nouns Esports - Dota Extension July - October\n\n# Nouns Esports Proposal - Dota Team Extension\n\nAuthors: Sasquatch and Maty\n\n### Goal\n\nContinue the Dota and Esports experiment! Extending the signing of our Dota roster until after [The International](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/The_International) in October, with the mission to proliferate Nouns through esports competition.\n\n### Description\n\n[Nouns Esports](https://twitter.com/nounsesports) was founded with the passing of [Proposal 68](https://nouns.wtf/vote/68), which brought a Professional Dota team under the Nouns banner. They won a large North American tournament and currently have a 6-1 standing in the Dota Pro Circuit \"DPC\" - the most important qualifier matches leading to the biggest tournament in the world, [The International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_(Dota_2)). \n\nThe teams' current term with the DAO will end on July 17th, after the DPC. Because of their DPC standing, they currently have a strong probability of attending the upcoming Arlington Major in August. Since our current proposal ends before this event, it makes sense to extend their term with the DAO. Their success in the rest of the DPC and the Major will determine if they qualify directly to The International.\n\nIf you want to learn more about Prop #68, an [accountability report](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-esports-pod/1030/5) was posted detailing how funds from the proposal were spent.\n\n### Timeline of Upcoming Potential Competitive Events:\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/b/bf4ae929b0d0a31086dc5ffaf3d40c355c4a17ec.png)\n\n\nJuly 17th - Prop #68 Ends\nJuly 16th-August 19th - Thunderpick Bitcoin Series TBS\nTBD July 17th-20th - Potential DPC Tiebreakers\nJuly 28th-30th - ESL Malaysia Qualifiers \nAugust 04-14th - Arlington Major\nAugust 23rd-28th - ESL Malaysia\nTBD likely September - The International Regional Qualifiers\nOct 15-30 - The International\nNovember 1st - Proposal Ends\n\n### Budget: 119,633 DAI / 99.6942 ETH (at $1200)\n* Salaries: ETH converted to DAI and distributed on a monthly basis as the team continues to represent Nouns in competition.\n    * Players + Coach Salaries: 60 ETH (estimated 72000 DAI)\n        * Split evenly amongst the players and coach.\n    * Support Staff: 20 ETH (estimated 24000 DAI)\n        * This includes social media support, design work, organizing practice, video content, organizing travel to events and to the bootcamp, player media appearance logistics, and strategically working with other Nouns infrastructure.\n* Bootcamp: 15 ETH (estimated 18000 DAI)\n    * This bootcamp fund will be deployed pending a successful qualification for an international event (ESL Malaysia, The International, etc.).\n* Builder Comp - 4.6942 ETH (estimated 5333 DAI)\n    - Sasquatch took no compensation per the [accountability report](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-esports-pod/1030/5) \n    - Organizing this project - shipping both props, operating the multi-sig, managing esports operations, and acting as a liaison between the team and Nouns DAO.\n\nWe are also adding 30 ETH to our on-chain ask in order to account for ETH/DAI volatility. ETH will be converted to match the estimated DAI distribution shared - surplus ETH will be returned to the DAO.\n\n### Dota Pod\n\nWe will be using the same multi-sig that was created via Proposal 68 consisting of Nouners and Nounsfolk. We will be swapping in Nouners Brian Cho and Oni to replace Wag and Goldy.\n- Sasquatch\n- Brennen\n- Maty\n- Brian Cho\n- Oni\n\n### Deliverables\n- Competitive Results\n    - From the Pilot (#68 proposal)...\n        - They won the [BTS Pro Series Season 11: Americas](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/BTS/Pro_Series/11/Americas) \n        - They are currently 6-1 and tied for first place in the DPC North America rankings. While not yet guaranteed, they have positioned themselves to have an excellent shot at attending the upcoming Major in Arlington, Texas.\n    - During this signing, past potentially competing in the Major they will have an opportunity to compete in the ESL Malaysia qualifiers, and qualifiers for The International. \n- Tournament Stream Viewership\n    - Tournament matches during the pilot have regularly received between 10,000 and 40,000 viewers. If the team qualifies for any of the upcoming international events, viewership will be a few multiples higher.\n        - The International 2021 had [2,700,000 peak viewers](https://escharts.com/events/international), excluding China.\n- Individual Stream Viewership\n    - Players individually stream and regularly present the Nouns brand on stream\n        - Our player Gunnar has been the most active streamer regularly getting a [few thousand viewers.](https://twitchtracker.com/gunnardota2)\n- In-game Branding\n    - Dota allows for DPC teams to have in-game branding through assets placed inside of the game's landscape. We have used this to show off Noggles during all of the tournament games in front of tens of thousands of viewers.\n- Name Branding\n    - The team will continue to operate as Nouns/Nouns Esports.\n- Player Name Branding\n    - Player names will include a Nounish sponsor tag in-game e.g. nouns.PlayerName.‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®",

      "content": "# Re-Elect Noun 22 as a DAO Core Contributor\n\n# Re-Elect Noun 22 as a DAO Core Contributor\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cEKQzYk.png)\n\nHi, this is [Noun 22](https://nouns.wtf/noun/22).  \n\nI have had the absolute pleasure of building on Nouns DAO as a Core Contributor for the better part of this year, and would love nothing more than if the DAO would support me to continue working for the DAO with the majority of my time.\n\n### Background\n\nAfter joining Nouns DAO in the first month of the project's inception, I have been fortunate enough to have the DAO's unanimous support to be compensated to work for the DAO in a variety of roles.\n* November 2021 - `Proposal 17` ([On-Chain](https://nouns.wtf/vote/17) / [Proposal](https://hackmd.io/@noun22/first-residency)) funded my trial residency as a community contributor for the DAO\n* February 2022 - `Proposal 38` ([On-Chain](https://nouns.wtf/vote/38) / [Proposal](https://hackmd.io/@noun22/core-contributor)) funded me to continue my work on the protocol as a Core Contributor for six months\n\nMy current contract is set to expire on August 24 2022, and this proposal would renew my contract with the DAO for another 6 months.\n\n\n---\n\n### My Work on Nouns\n**1. Small Grants (SG)**\n\nThe Nouns DAO Small Grants and Retroactive Funding Pool was originally formed in [November 2021](https://nouns.wtf/vote/13).  Since then, SG has evolved into flexible pool of capital that is managed on a fully discretionary basis to serve the DAO's interests in a variety of ways.\n\nI am the lead for SG and I manage its day to day operations.  As the DAO has grown, incoming inquiry has scaled with it.  Running SG is what I spend most of my time on every day.  The group does not presently have an operational budget, and my compensation for this work is included as part of my role as Core Contributor. \n\nI'm very proud of what has been accomplished so far at SG.  The group has funded many builders and projects (detailed below) that have generated tremendous value for the DAO.  Many of the DAO's most successful proposals started as a trial sponsored by SG, and many of the DAO's most valuable community members were funded/onboarded by SG when they first joined the community.  In my experience running SG for the better part of a year, I have seen many instances in which a 1 ETH grant can generate more value to the DAO than an 100+ ETH proposal.  The crypto ecosystem is rife with rugs and scams, and that is precisely why our generosity on the individual level leaves such a lasting impression and inspires such fierce loyalty.\n\nToday, SG serves multiple roles for the DAO: we are the DAO's working capital, a Nounish venture pod, and an onboarding tool. SG has the flexibility to quickly:\n* Fund exciting smaller proposals (in concert with Prop House)\n* Vet new builders and derisk new projects by funding trials ahead of sponsoring larger on-chain proposals\n* Be a first point of contact and source of funding to onboard new community members \n* Retroactively reward builders \n* Provide time-sensitive and milestone based funding as a part of larger proposals\n* Fill other ad hoc daily capital needs of the DAO (contests, bug bounties, etc)\n\nMy daily work on SG includes:\n* Engaging with community members that request funding\n* Providing feedback on and tracking multiple proposals\n* Monitoring and responding to new inquiry over Discord and [Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/u/noun22/activity)\n* Diligencing proposals to prevent waste and fraud\n* Negotiating funding terms\n* Following up with funded builders\n* Building a relationship with new builders and onboarding them deeper into the Nouns ecosystem\n* Administrative tasks  \n\nI conduct the majority of SG's operations on [Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/u/noun22/activity) and in the `#grants-and-retro-funding` channel in the Nouns DAO Discord.  \n\nSince inception, SG has funded 100+ builders with over 230 ETH.  [This link contains information on everything SG has funded to date](https://noun22.notion.site/noun22/Nouns-DAO-Small-Grants-ac22114a6c004bafa500e2d824e32dc3).  Some highlights from the track record:\n* Trial for the Nouns Vision luxury glasses by [Salvino Armati](https://twitter.com/SalvinoArmati) that led to [Proposal 57](https://nouns.wtf/vote/57)\n* [Lil Nouns](https://lilnouns.wtf/)\n* Trial for Fun Noggles by [Bigshot Klim](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-functional-noun-glasses/685) which led to [Proposal 56](https://nouns.wtf/vote/56) \n* [Nouns Mural in SoHo during NFT NYC](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1536765342445359104?s=20&t=qL6HN2lEVWb2TdrdrB3Kmw)\n* Funded maty to build the [proposal dashboard](https://maty-eth.notion.site/maty-eth/NounsDAO-Proposals-Overview-b8c76e6ac8e44515966ee032ea20f860) with the status of all On-Chain and Prop House proposals, the [Nouns newsletter](https://nouns.substack.com/), and [Prop House proposal summaries](https://maty-eth.notion.site/maty-eth/9cf308a53bc6437ab6d56d4d66fb55c2?v=9ba27c16f6f947d2bc0590314ac7346b)\n* Sponsorship + Nouns table at the annual [Coin Center Dinner](https://www.coincenter.org/dinner/)\n* Trial for The Noun Square that led to [Proposal 101](https://nouns.wtf/vote/101)\n* Trial for Nouns Athletes that led to [Proposal 51](https://nouns.wtf/vote/51)\n* Funded aubtoshi for [Nouns on the Ground](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-on-the-ground-nft-nyc-activation/1215) during NFT NYC that led to an [Proposal 110](https://nouns.wtf/vote/110)\n* Trial for Messhup's coloring book pages that led to [Proposal 34](https://nouns.wtf/vote/34) and the [Coloring Book Contest](https://twitter.com/undeadnoun22/status/1478085928602279936) \n* Trial for [FOMO v2](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-fomo-v2/1317), to expand [FOMO](https://fomonouns.wtf/), one of the DAO's most [successful proposals](https://nouns.wtf/vote/8).\n* [Noggle AR Filters for social media](https://noggles.wtf/)\n* Ad hoc Twitter contests - [4156 Noun O'Clock](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1534250110963568641?s=20&t=8HDo-zHgcvHcdgFwNs-Ekg), [Nounify The Superbowl](https://twitter.com/nounsdao/status/1492623223900549120)\n* [Nounish Jingles](https://twitter.com/natemillsart)\n* [The immediate retroactive reward for the discovery of ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®](https://twitter.com/mattdowney)\n* Small Grants has been the initial source of funding that contributed to the onboarding of some of the DAO's most active and engaged community members, including maty, Joel Cares, Messhup, Salvino, Noadz, aubtoshi, and many other Nouncil members\n\nMy vision for the future of SG:\n* Continue to generate value for Nouns DAO by seeding high potential projects and builders in the ecosystem \n* Build a pipeline of more ambitious trials and sponsor them as on-chain proposals\n* Improved comms / organization -  I am exploring tools to have a central location for all funding requests and other information\n* Continue to innovate on new ways for SG to add value to Nouns DAO\n\n\n**2. Community Building: Onboarding New Nouners / Weekly Calls**\n\nSince I first joined the DAO a year ago, I have reached out to every new member to organize an onboarding call.  To date, I have done over 100+ of these calls.  If you are voting this proposal, we have likely had one of these calls - if we haven't please reach out to me on Discord!\n\nAdditionally, I host the weekly [US Nouner Town Hall call every Tuesday at 5:30pm ET](https://hackmd.io/@noun22/nounweekly).  The call initially started as an informal meet and greet where we first got the opportunity to hear each other's voices and get to know each other, and has evolved into a more structured format where we discuss and form consensus on topical issues.  \n\nI host these calls not just to meet and build relationships with fascinating, cool, like-minded people, but I view them as integral to creating and strengthening a sense of community within the DAO.\n\nNouns is the most exciting and innovative project in crypto, but we cannot become complacent and view our success as inevitable.  The DAO's greatest long term threat is member apathy and disengagement - particularly as we have entered into what may be a lasting crypto bear market.  Members who feel lost or confused will quickly become inactive members, and the DAO will suffer as a result.\n\nI will continue to use my experience in the role to foster an atmosphere of open communication and experimentation where every community member feels they are able to contribute to the DAO.  Everyone needs to feel that their opinions are heard and their proposal ideas are fairly considered.  In my role, I try and be a neutral go-between and source of feedback to maintain harmony within the DAO.  \n\nMy involvement with Nouns has been the absolute high point of my career.  I have never felt this level of excitement and optimism about my work.  Thanks for reading this, and I look forward to continuing to Nounify The World with you all ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\n\n### Compensation\nBeing a Core Contributor for Nouns DAO is a unique role within a unique organization.  I hope this proposal has demonstrated the value I have generated for Nouns DAO, my passion for this organization, and convinced you of why I am uniquely suited to continue in this role going foward.\n\nThe nominal $ value of my last contract with the DAO was $32k per month for 6 months.  For this contract I propose an extension at the same nominal $ rate:\n* 6 month term\n* Nominal $32k per month paid in USDC\n* Nouns DAO can vote to cancel the contract at any point\n* ETH to be sent to the SG multi-sig address and a portion will converted to USDC upon receipt\n* Funds will be put into a Sablier contract that commences on August 25 2022 with a 6 month duration",

With just one month of scheduling time, NounsOTG was able to plan, coordinate and complete its first multi-day activation at NFT.NYC, resulting in some planned and some unexpected exposure for the [Nouns](https://www.nouns.wtf) brand at one of the leading industry events of the year.\n\n![NFT NYC](https://imgur.com/tLh2n5Z.png)\n\n### Key Moments From This Activation\n\n - Activations inside the NFT.NYC event all three days at the different event locations\n - Gnars event in Time Square where we met other nounish projects\n - Filmed at the Noun mural with the nounish film crew / [Proposal 64](https://nouns.wtf/vote/64)\n - Unexpected/surprise filming with Shopify putting NounsDAO in their official NFT video\n - In-studio filming with Stoopid Buddy / [Proposal 73](https://nouns.wtf/vote/73)\n - Sandbox event at Gotham Hall, introduced Andy Milonakis to Nouns and the different forks\n - Noun O‚ÄôClock meetups IRL / On-site hosting\n - Met notable NFT musicians and began conversation that led to a feature performance by a #1 musician in the Noun O‚ÄôClock space\n - Connected with other nounish builders and people from Prop.House\n\n![NFT NYC](https://imgur.com/gWur0ZO.png)\n\n### Clear Takeaways From This Activation\n - IRL is important to solidify proliferation of the Nouns\n - IRL invites unexpected growth opportunities for Nouns\n - ‚ÄúOn The Ground‚Äù promotion is an effective decentralized marketing tool\n - IRL brand recognition creates authentic and memorable user connection\n\n![Shopify Ad](https://imgur.com/d4v1R97.png)\n\n## WHAT‚ÄôS NEXT? ‚åê‚óê-‚óê\n\nMore events, more proliferation and more recognition! **Nouns On The Ground** wants to replicate and scale the success of NFT.NYC for the Nouns, by targeting 4 other major key hubs for future Nouners and Nounish builders. To clarify, **Nouns On The Ground** will be working to replicate the ROI and general recognition of the NFT.NYC activation. Flexible ‚Äúon the ground‚Äù event planning is an important element, keeping the process decentralized, new and always changing. The goal of The **Proliferation Pod** will be to create new and unique experiences catered to each event.\n\nThe **Proliferation Pod** will manage the Proposal amount to cover the costs of these events. ETH funding will need to be converted to USD to cover travel costs, merch/swag orders and other event related fees. The same budget used for the NFT.NYC event, which was 6 ETH, totals to 11 ETH today to adjust for the change in ETH price since initial funding. **Nouns On The Ground** can replicate these activations for the same amount as previously proven in New York with a slight added cost for travel for NFT London.\n\n![IRL Events](https://imgur.com/uJYIXYl.png)\n\n### NFT3 AWARDS (August 5-7) in Los Angeles, CA (11 ETH)\n\nA unique event that has started garnering attention from musicians and artists utilizing NFTs. The NFT3 Awards in Los Angeles and will have over 16,000 attendees which is roughly the same size as NFT.NYC. The NFT3 Awards will be the premiere NFT summer event on the West Coast. Nouns On The Ground will immediately begin planning this next activation. This will create consistency throughout the US NFT markets, as the Nouns meme continues to spread across the world in Rio, Sweden, Tokyo and more.\n\nI will have swag and merch on hand for ‚Äú Noggle recognition awards‚Äù, multiple hidden AR POAP dispensers for event POAP collecting and of course, more stickers and buttons with 10 newly featured Nouns to hit the ground. DM if you want your Noun featured this time! I will continue to post updates in this thread as we get closer to the event.\n\n### NOUNS DOTA FINALS (August 10-14) in Arlington, TX (11 ETH)\n\nThe currently undefeated NOUNS DOTA team is a guarantee for the Finals. We need Nouns On The Ground to proliferate Nouns throughout the stadium, amongst the Nouns fans and entire audience. We‚Äôve started throwing around the idea of Noggle sports towels. Nouns On The Ground is in the NounsEsports Discord and ready to coordinate other live events to bring well deserved attention to this highly successful NounsDAO Proposal. This would be the best event of the 5 for a big T-shirt order as well.\n\n### NFT NASHVILLE (September 1-5) in Nashville, TN (11 ETH)\n\nNFT Nashville is striving to be the premiere NFT music event of the South as it brings a ‚Äúfestival-like‚Äù NFT event to the heart of the music capital during the Labor Day weekend. Some of the top current NFT music artists, including Sammy Ariaga, call Nashville home and have set the tone for NFT Nashville to enter the music scene with a bang. After starting through local meet-ups, NFT Nashville has quickly set a precedent for community building within this industry and the presence of the Nouns is necessary for proliferation.\n\n### NFT LONDON (November 6-7) in London, United Kingdom (18 ETH)\n\nNFT.London is being organized by the same team behind NFT.NYC, so you can already guarantee this will be one of Europe‚Äôs main NFT events of the year. With people already tweeting about grabbing tickets to this event, it is a no brainer to have Nouns fully on the ground in the UK. There is a slight increase in the funding cost for this event to account for additional travel costs.\n\n### ART BASEL MIAMI BEACH (December 1-4) in Miami, FL (11 ETH)\n\nArt Basel is another fantastic event for NFTs and proliferation of the Nouns Brand. Last year‚Äôs event in Miami Beach was the launchpad for some of the largest brands currently in the industry. This event is known for setting art trends and the Nouns meme needs to be logged in event attendee memories to close out the year in a strong way.\n\n### NOUNS ON THE GROUND OPERATION COSTS (18 ETH)\n\nWhy choose Aubtoshi and Nouns On The Ground for these events? I have a proven successful track record with this type of proliferation and have modeled my plans for each of these 4 events after the successful New York multi-day activation. The job will get done with added elements of surprise and key events that always arise when engaging IRL. I am also involved with multiple Nounish projects that also seek to proliferate the Nouns brand and have incorporated these projects during my activations as well.\n\n[Prop House Proposal Round 1](https://prop.house/proposal/41) / [Prop House Proposal Round 2](https://prop.house/proposal/71) / [Prop House Proposal Round 3](https://prop.house/proposal/117) / [Small Grants Proposal](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/nouns-on-the-ground-nft-nyc-activation/1215/3) (funded 6 ETH) / [Lost Nouns - Noun O‚ÄôTalk S:1 EP:15](https://twitter.com/cdt_eth/status/1542260980046073856?s=20&t=-z9THGWZCxf2o4oAfNSosg) / [Noun O‚ÄôClock Spaces with Noun Square](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock/status/1544475669266038787?s=20&t=-z9THGWZCxf2o4oAfNSosg) / [Nouns News Proposal w/Aubtoshi Avatar](https://prop.house/proposal/598)\n\n![Noun Prop House and Events](https://imgur.com/ehY6m08.png)\n![Twitter Spaces and Nounish News](https://imgur.com/qA2e2mv.png)\n\n\nNounsDAO funding Nouns On The Ground to operate in this fashion will allow this proven project to grow and scale without having to come to the DAO per each event. Proliferating the Nouns is the goal. I would love for NounsDAO to continue to let me show you the wonderful, creative and unexpected ways we can do just that, on the ground, IRL!\n\n## TOTAL PROPOSAL ASK: 92 ETH ($110,400) over 6 months ‚åêŒû-Œû\n***ETH calculated at 1 ETH = $1,200 USD**\n***15% added for volatility w/any extra being sent back to NounsDAO**\n\nInstead of having multiple proposals for each event as they come, this one proposal will cover the costs of these events planned within a 6 month period. The amount will be held in a multi-sig wallet, in USD, that will release funds in the following manner:\n\n\n**IMMEDIATE** - Initial release for Event 1 & Event 1.5 & Op: 25 ETH ($30,000 USD)\n08/01/22 - Release for Event 2 & Op: 14 ETH ($16,800 USD)\n09/01/22 - Release for Event 3 & Op: 21 ETH ($25,200 USD)\n10/01/22 - Release for Event 4 & Op: 14 ETH ($16,800 USD)\n11/01/22 - Release for Op: 3 ETH ($3,600 USD)\n12/01/22 - Release for Op: 3 ETH ($3,600 USD)\n**Total: 80 ETH ($96,000 USD)** distributed through 6 transactions over the course of 6 months (July 2022-Dec 2022) as outlined above\n\nAt the suggestion made by Seneca above, we have added 15% to account for volatility:\n\n15% Increase added for volatility to 80 ETH = 12 ETH ($14,400)\nTotal ETH ask including 15% increase for volatility = 92 ETH\nTotal USD ask including 15% increase for volatility = $110,400 USD\n\n**PLEASE NOTE:** All ETH not used strictly for reasons relating to volatility in ETH price will be sent back to the NounsDAO from the multi-sig wallet.\n\nThere will be 3 individuals for the 2/3 signers verification to ensure proper distribution of funds on the correct date. \n\n**Signer 1**: Aubtoshi\n**Signer 2**: 142\n**Signer 3**: Seneca\n\n![Dominoe Effect](https://imgur.com/ctVSkv9.png)\n\n\nAn additional part of the overall success of Nouns On The Ground Proliferation Pod will come through collaboration with other Nounish builders. Please reach out via [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/NounsOTG) or Discord (aubtoshi#9612) to talk all things collab!\n\n## LONG-TERM ‚ÄúNOUNISH‚Äù GOALS ‚åê‚ó™-‚ó™\nThis experimental Proliferation Pod is the next clear step for Nouns On The Ground as an appropriate scaling measure. Aubtoshi isn‚Äôt going anywhere and will continue to bring value to this community. A personal long-term goal is to be a woman Nouner. Until I have the opportunity to join the community as an official Nouner, I will continue to proliferate the Nouns in the most fun and effective ways that I can make possible. Thank you Nouners for giving me this chance to show you what we can do together, On The Ground! \n\n![Aubtoshi!](https://imgur.com/X5mwdw0.png)\n\n\n**Multi-sig Wallet Address to send ETH**: 0x5b35c3EF0acF9660a7d3fcefc2A2053a7CEC20E3\n",

Our goal is to create a cut and sewn Nouns clothing line to seed through public channels with the intention of building brand familiarity outside of web3.\n\nThe team behind Nouns Brand is highly experienced in web3 and fashion. Among other things, we recently created the [Creature World x Advisry](https://twitter.com/creatureworld/status/1477758094667100161?s=20&t=yli7rD42olxZUdtHNwnQjA) clothing collection.\n\n**Total Ask: 355Œû**\n\n### Video Pitch\n[![Hello](https://i.imgur.com/9kWmKUO.png)](https://streamable.com/oui7m1/) \n([Alternative link to video](https://streamable.com/oui7m1))\n\n---\n# Why Nouns Brand?\n‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® is the full stack of web3 with a dash of magic. Nouns implies quality and creativity, but also carries a whiff of mass culture which has the potential to turn the noses of consumers outside of the know.\n\nFrom a business perspective, the full-speed push into tasteful clothing that pulls from Nouns imagery is a logical step forward. What is cc0 without encouraging designers and artists the freedom to take Nouns creative assets and explore? *The next generation of artists will wear Nouns.*\n\n### Proposal\n**Fund Nouns Brand ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® to**:\n- design, manufacture, and produce artisanal garments (entirely **cut & sew**, *not* plug and play)\n- open a channel of collaboration between legacy brands and Nouns\n- seed Nouns clothing via PR, publications, and marketing media\n\n**How does it benefit the DAO?**\n- For the cost of ~3.5 days of auctions, we can add a creative vertical to Nouns that expands the audience and inspires future builders. Nouns esports(*jersey/tracksuit concept in bottom left corner of mockup*)  is an unexpected vertical that has already onboarded enough people to return a multiple of the funding amount to the DAO. \n- Entire collection **free for Noun holders** (1-time use code, 1 free item per style), **forever**.\n\n![tagmockup](https://i.imgur.com/ahYiWq2.png)\n---\n\n# Development\n### Pre-Production  (1-2 months)\n- Design Phase -* work *with designers to produce unique designs, prints, and patterns\n- Creation of tech-packs\n- Pattern Making / Size Grading - work with top pattern makers within NYC to create intricate, functional garments.\n- Muslin Fittings - use patterns to develop a muslin of the garments that could be used for fit tests on models of different sizes to ensure each measurement is perfect before production with our actual fabrics begin.\n- Fabric Sourcing - work within the Garment District to find quality wholesale and deadstock fabrics to use for each individual muslin fitted garment. Develop custom fabrics owned and used by Nouns Brand.\n- **Consult Gremplin, the Nounders, and any relevant parties to finalize designs that feel truly Nounish.**\n- Acquire samples and reach quality assurance.\n\n### Production (2-4 months)\n- Engage factories in Italy, Japan, Portugal, China, and/or India.\n\n### Post-Production\n- Shoot lookbooks and editorial imagery while bulk order is produced.\n- Release collection in conjunction with PR coverage, lookbook release, and wildpasting campaign\n- Custom online storefront\n    - We will engage web teams who have worked with [Drake](https://drakerelated.com/#front), [A$AP Rocky](https://muse.place/), and [Creature World](https://creature.world/) in order to produce a unique user experience when shopping with Nouns\n- International fulfillment center for shipment and inventory management\n    - Free shipping worldwide for **every** order\n    - Nouns holders and delegates receive 1 size/style of every item for free.\n\n---\n# Outreach\n### Advertising\n- Wheat-posters\n    - Printing and posting wheat-posters around NYC, Miami, LA, Hong Kong, London using teams who handle campaigns for Supreme, Nordstrom, Ray Bans, etc.\n    - We have assisted Nounish friends such as Vector DAO, Nouns Coffee, and others in sourcing wild pasting campaigns in major NYC neighborhoods\n\n### Marketing + PR\n- Hiring of PR agencies such as Orienteer or Gia Kuan agency to facilitate and catapult expansion of Nouns brand, basics, lifestyle products, etc.\n    - Editorial write ups (our previous work has been featured in GQ, Forbes, and Vogue without PR representation)\n    - Product Seeding\n    - Publicity\n    - Stockists (being carried in retail stores such as Uniqlo, Kith, Dover Street Market, etc.)\n\n### Marketing Materials\n- Editorials\n- Lookbook\n- Product Photos\n\n---\n# Costs\n\n### Pre-Production (100Œû)\n\n**Design Fee and Materials**\nDesign, pattern-making, cost of fabrics, and labor costs.\n\n**Sampling Costs**\nRoughly $1,000-3,000 USD per style (factories charge premium to fulfill small shipments and require a minimum of pieces ordered when testing a new product, such as a custom nouns belt, which we‚Äôve been quoted at $1,700 to get the minimum amount of samples made for 3 belt color ways.)\n\n### Production (180Œû)\n*This is an estimate of our expected costs to produce, ship, and store a wholesale order of products.*\n\n### Post-Production (75Œû)\n**Product photos (total ~$7,000)**\nPhotographer ($3,000)\nRetouching ($1,200)\nStudio ($800)\nCrew ($1,700)\nFood ($100)\nTravel ($100)\n\n**Campaign/Lookbook (total ~$25,000)**\nPhotographer ($5,000)\nModels ($800-1,200 per)\nLocation/Travel ($1,000-3,000)\nEditing and film development ($1,500-2,000)\nCrew ($6,000)\nPrep day ‚Äî styling, rentals, labor (usually 1/3 of crew budget, $2,000)\nWheatpasting ($3,000)\n\n**PR (~$15,000)**\nA typical quality PR agency charges 3,000-10,000/month and requires a minimum engagement period, usually 3 months.\n\n**Staffing ($30,000)**\nFor hiring crew to handle shipping, fulfillment, inventory, and customer service for 4 months\n\n### Total Ask: 355Œû\n\n---\n# Future of Nouns Brand\n*This section contains our vision for what the future of Nouns Brand could be and is **outside the scope** of this prop.*\n\nFashion is gatekept, we believe art is for everyone. To encourage others to start their own creative journeys, our dream is to create a direct-to-consumer white label service for artists to make their own clothes through Nouns Brand. We will use Nouns Blanks to allow people to print designs and empower people to create, built on Nouns.\n\n### Collaborations\n**Nouns Brand can be a channel for collaboration as companies seek partners in bridging the gaps of the sacred and profane: web2 and web3.** \n\nWork with aligning companies we have relationships with to create limited collaborations with Nouns through Nouns Brand, our wish list includes:\n- Nouns Esports - gaming (jersey design and partnerships with Gunnar Optics, G Fuel, etc.)\n- Gucci - fashion\n- Carrots - streetwear\n- Adidas - fashion/footwear\n- Dr Martens - footwear\n- Crocs - footwear\n- Swatch, Casio - watches\n- Tiffany & Co - jewelry\n- Rimowa - luggage\n- Ikea - furniture\n\n### Direct-To-Consumer White Label Service\n- We will wholesale our Nouns Brand blanks and develop a white label service for emerging artists to create their own clothes\n- Nouns White Label Facility\n- Custom color ways of Nouns blanks: Nouns Dye House\n- Team of print and embroidery specialists to customize Nouns blanks, such as t-shirts, hoodies, hats, etc.\n    - Blanks are made to supply the clothing industry. Blank clothing has no added decoration. Many clothing \"labels\" begin with a good blank, add their own logos, designs or trimmings, re-label and on-sell to retailers, or sell direct at markets, online, etc.\n- DTG Print & Embroidery Machines\n- White Label Fulfillment Team\n- Wholesale Blank Accounts\n\n### The Nounge (Shop)\nWe envision a Nouns brick and mortar store, the Nounge, in the Soho neighborhood of New York City. An experiential Nouns Brand space to shop and serve as a storefront for collaboration activations. The Nounge will also serve as the premiere carrier for Nouns Coffee in NY.\n\n- Brick-and-mortar shop\n- Activation site for brand collaborations and events\n- Accepts Fiat and Crypto as payment method\n- Photography Studio for emerging Nouns projects\n\n---\n# Team\n**Keith -** owner and creative director of Advisry.

These include the use of novel mechanisms, passionate membership, and a compelling long-term vision through its commitment towards funding and creating more public goods ([here](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1541959504576782336), [here](https://nouns.wtf/vote/21) and [here](https://medium.com/@punk4156/funding-real-world-public-goods-with-the-nouns-dao-treasury-7939328acc12)). Underpinning it all, the community has tapped into the collective power generated by bundling individual motivations into a well-designed coordination mechanism.\n\nSimilarly, the Protocol Guild is purpose built to incentivize individual contributions through a collective mechanism. This parallel alignment could be enhanced by engaging each within the other: Nouns should fund the Protocol Guild Pilot. This ‚Äúengine to engine‚Äù relationship:\n\n* expresses the Nouns vision in new contexts\n* facilitates a mutually beneficial exchange of narrative value and financial value\n* weaves deeper meaning into the Nouns community story while reinforcing positive sum norms\n\n‚ÄúEthereum is an unprecedented arena for playing cooperative games‚Äù ([Griffith, 2019](https://medium.com/@virgilgr/ethereum-is-game-changing-technology-literally-d67e01a01cf8)): we should manifest the collaborative opportunities enabled by this arena.\n\n# Existing Mechanism / Funding Context\n\nWatch / listen to this [Funding Ethereum with the Protocol Guild](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVN97qA4gBs&list=PLhuBigpl7lqvMt8d7h4sbCmra9KbFmAdg&t) presentation or read below.\n\nIn Nov. 2021, a group of core Ethereum contributors started exploring the incentive mechanism proposed in [this tweet](https://twitter.com/dannyryan/status/1454065104819916803?s=20&t=_ZC0BS5LfeCvaSbD4WxKKg) via this framing: What mechanism could help us better attract/retain talent and fund core protocol contributors?\n\nWe surfaced three challenges to address:\n\n1. Curation is hard\n  * Interested sponsors don‚Äôt have a single mechanism which curates all protocol contributors\n  * Protocol contributors interested in receiving funding aren‚Äôt sure how to self-organize\n  * Existing solutions bias towards teams & can‚Äôt surface all contributors\n2. Incentives are imbalanced\n  * Financial incentives are skewed towards newer projects with upside/tokens\n  * Existing public goods funding solutions usually don‚Äôt consider exposure to upside to applications/L2s - eg. soliciting tokens from initial allocations or recurring revenue from existing projects\n3. Churn is bad\n  * Steep learning curve for new contributors to meaningfully contribute\n  * Contributor value grows over time, but there is less incentive to stay once they are experts\n\n# Protocol Guild\n\nThrough a lot of discussion and iteration, the **Protocol Guild** was formed: a collective of protocol contributors which actively maintains an onchain registry of its membership.\n\nIn response to the challenges above, the org was designed to carry out specific activities:\n\n1. Self-curate an onchain registry of individuals\n  * Sponsors only need to know a single contract address instead of many separate team addresses, they can trust that there is quality backing it\n  * Members now have a single mechanism to coordinate around and solicit sponsorships to\n  * Domain expert members can surface part time contribs or lower profile collaborators which may be missed by other existing mechanisms\n2. Solicit sponsorships to balance financial incentives\n  * Bootstrap with high profile DAO treasuries\n  * Longterm, build norms around pre-allocation of a % of initial token supply\n3. Incentivize long-term contributions\n  * 6 month min before eligibility\n  * Vesting gets people to stick around\n  * Time weighted allocations to recognize the importance of long term contributors\n\nTo date, the membership includes over [110 Ethereum protocol contributors](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/9-membership.html), including researchers, client maintainers, upgrade coordinators, tooling maintainers. This is a broad-based ecosystem effort: members come from 22 different teams and 9 organizations. Only 40% of members are directly employed by the EF. The membership is continuously curated through quarterly updates to the split contract - we expect the membership to grow over the next year.\n\nThe Guild contracts are an autonomous value routing mechanism, operated independently from any existing institution, purpose-built for incentivizing long-term core protocol work. At no point does PG take custody of funds on behalf of members, it is all handled trustlessly. Learn more about the smart contracts we are using for the Pilot [here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/3-smart-contract.html).\n\n# 2022 Pilot\n\nSince starting the project in Nov 2021, we‚Äôve built norms around member onboarding , refined the splitting and vesting mechanisms, and created extensive documentation on how it should be operated.\n\nWe‚Äôve kicked off a test of the mechanism‚Äôs efficacy with a 1 year / $10mm Pilot. So far, we‚Äôve raised $5.4mm (as of June 28 2022) from a number of notable communities, including:\n\n* [2mm LDO from the Lido community](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-to-fund-the-protocol-guild-pilot-via-a-lido-grant/2016)\n* [200k ENS from the ENS community](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep13-executable-support-the-protocol-guild-pilot/12877)\n* [500k UNI from the Uniswap community](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-should-the-uniswap-community-participate-in-the-protocol-guild-pilot/16824)\n\nSecured funding can be tracked onchain through the [Pilot vesting contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/). We are currently engaging with a number of other notable projects to secure the remainder of the $10mm target.\n\n# Proposal\n\nWe are inviting the Nouns community to contribute 500 ETH (2% of the treasury) to the 1 year Pilot vesting contract deployed at [theprotocolguild.eth](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0xF29Ff96aaEa6C9A1fBa851f74737f3c069d4f1a9/) (0xF29‚Ä¶f1a9).\n\nThe ETH will vest to each beneficiary members listed on the underlying split at [0x84af‚Ä¶8ea1](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0x84af3D5824F0390b9510440B6ABB5CC02BB68ea1/). Each recipient will make an independent decision about how to use the ETH once vested.\n\nThere are a few reasons why supporting the Protocol Guild Pilot benefits the Nouns community:\n\n* Nouns‚Äô long-term success is tightly coupled with the continued evolution and maintenance of the Ethereum protocol. These are projects that often have multi-year timelines:\n  * [The Merge](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/Merge/mainnet-readiness.md): moving from PoW to PoS, increasing security and sustainability\n  * EVM improvements: new functionality for application developers like [EOF](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ipsilon/evm-object-format-overview)\n  * [Statelessness](https://notes.ethereum.org/@gballet/Sy-a6T5St): sustainable management for state growth as the network scales\n  * Supporting Layer 2 scaling: [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844), [EIP-4488](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4488)\n  * [Proposer Builder Separation](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/pbs_censorship_resistance): reducing centralizing incentives for consensus participants\n  * Continuous client maintenance: improving sync, exploring new database types, researching and improving modular clients\n  * Coordinating network upgrades: making sure the community helps to shape and is aware of network upgrades\n* Pilot participation introduces a new facet for Nouns as a public goods funder\n* Early support of a new mechanism recognizes another ‚Äúfellow traveler‚Äù pushing the boundaries of incentive frameworks\n* Diverse funding sources from the community further decentralizes protocol governance and prevents influence from pooling with any single entity\n\nWe hope that a successful Pilot will pave the way for future funding collaborations between Nouns and the Protocol Guild as we scale up. To that end, we think it‚Äôs important to demonstrate impact before we scale: learn more about how we will evaluate [Pilot outcomes here](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5-initial-pilot.html). We want to make sure the mechanism operates smoothly before graduating to a full-scale fundraising round with longer vesting periods.",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 107",
      "content": "# NounsDAO investment in Verse\n\n### TLDR\n\nThis proposal is for a NounsDAO investment in Verse, a new protocol for autonomous NFTs on Ethereum.\n\n### Who is behind this proposal?\n\nhey everyone! My name‚Äôs Kiran. I‚Äôm the founder of Verse, an autonomous NFT protocol on Ethereum. Previously, I worked on product design for PartyDAO, and in my web2 life I was a product engineer in the biotech space.\n\n### What is Verse?\n\nVerse is a protocol for autonomous NFTs on Ethereum. What does that mean? Verse enables the creation of NFTs with an embedded market that operates autonomously without the need for a central marketplace. Here‚Äôs a quick overview of how the protocol mechanism works:\n\nThrough the protocol, a creator deploys a contract Pair consisting of an ERC-20 Exchange contract and an ERC-721 Hyperobject contract. The dynamic price and supply of the ERC-20 token is managed by a bonding curve acting as an AMM. Simply, this means that anyone can buy and sell the token at any time with instant liquidity, and the contract will programmatically adjust the price based on the circulating supply. Holders of at least 1 atomic unit of the ERC-20 token can then redeem their token. Redeeming a token transfers the holder‚Äôs ERC-20 to the paired Hyperobject contract, which mints a new NFT and transfers it to the redeemer in exchange.\n\n### What is the status of Verse?\n\nThe contracts for Verse V1 are live on mainnet, and the public beta interface to interact with the protocol is live at verse.xyz. Verse V2 is currently in development, with significant UX improvements and nounish mechanisms built into the core protocol.\n\n### What can be built on Verse?\n\nThe Verse protocol represents a new medium for NFTs, and enables the creation of digital objects that have their own embedded market. Although the NFT space is still in its early infancy, we can observe some fundamental truths about the medium. Most notably, NFTs aren‚Äôt just assets or static files or jpegs. NFTs are programmable objects built to take advantage of the internet as a meme proliferation machine. In the long-term, skeuomorphic token representations like 1/1s will diminish in the market, and NFTs with programmable supply & pricing mechanisms will dominate. A significant sector of the NFT market will be represented by these types of objects, and are best suited to be exchanged via programmable markets powered by Verse. Think about it [this way](https://twitter.com/punk4156/status/1530697363714605056?s=20&t=-FFqbcGhiso88p_ZAhgOlg). Does it really make sense for a meme to exist as a static 1/1? Or does it make sense for its supply and value to dynamically change based on its demand in the market and its mindshare on the internet?\n\n### NounsDAO investment in the Verse Protocol\n\nVerse is a new NFT protocol designed to catalyze the future development of programmable internet objects. Nouns is the prototype for meme proliferation and how to build a CC0 brand that permeates the internet. Ultimately, both entities are designed to build a more composable internet in which individuals build, own, and use digital objects that accrue value as they‚Äôre integrated across the web.\n\nSpecifically, Verse V2 is incorporating mechanisms into the core protocol which seek to standardize the meme-proliferation system (programmable supply, programmable treasury controlled by NFT holders) that Nouns has pioneered. Details of the exact mechanisms will be shared closer to V2‚Äôs testnet launch.\n\nWe‚Äôre closing a funding round for Verse, and firmly believe that the protocol shouldn‚Äôt only be owned by traditional venture or finance institutions - it should have ownership from decentralized groups actively advancing and building progressive technologies in the NFT ecosystem.\n\nThus, we‚Äôd like to propose an investment from NounsDAO in the Verse protocol.\nWe think that an investment/long-term partnership would be far more powerful than a grant in that an investment incentivizes both parties (NounsDAO & Verse) to ensure that the protocol builds for long-term success, and uses the Nouns brand as a playground for innovating on new NFT mechanisms.\n\nThere‚Äôs tremendous synergy between the goals of Nouns and Verse, and a long-term partnership would entail close collaborations to build future Nouns-related NFT projects on Verse, and the ability for the DAO to have a real hand in how the protocol evolves over time.\n\n### Investment Specifics\nNounsDAO invests 175 ETH in exchange for 0.4-0.5% equity into Verse Labs (the incorporated company building the Verse protocol) with an optional token warrant. These equity figures are consistent with the current terms we have with our lead investors for our most recent funding round.\n\nA portion of the funding would go directly toward purchasing a Noun, either via the daily auction (preferred), or purchasing from an existing Nouner on secondary. I want to align the interests of Nouns x Verse as long-term as possible, and believe that by essentially exchanging ownership in the Verse protocol for representation in NounsDAO, we‚Äôd create a truly symbiotic relationship. I like to think that Nouns is building the closest thing we‚Äôve seen to an internet city, with a distinct community, culture, and economy. Much like the way tech companies in the past decade set up shop in the bay area and saw the valley as a playground for innovation, I want Verse to have a ‚Äúcampus‚Äù set up in the Nouns universe, and build with the Nouns brand as a launchpad for new types of NFT distribution & exchange experiments that help proliferate the meme. The key difference, though, is that while SF never received ownership and experienced upside in the success of major silicon valley companies, Nouns would directly have ownership in Verse.\n\nLogistically, there‚Äôs a couple ways the investment could work from a compliance & regulatory perspective. For starters, I‚Äôve created an investment DAO through syndicate.io, which allows contributions in crypto (USDC or ETH). In exchange for the investment, NounsDAO would receive a proportional amount of tokens which represent ownership in this DAO. The associated legal entity for this DAO (an LLC acting as an investment SPV) would then be part of the cap table for Verse Labs, the legal entity building the Verse protocol. The SPV would in turn own the equity. Of course, this is just one option for formalizing the investment structure, and I‚Äôm happy to work with the nounders on any alternative structure that makes sense.\n\nOverall, I‚Äôm excited to share this proposal with the Nouns community, and even more excited for the possibility to partner with the DAO on building fundamentally valuable NFT infrastructure with the Verse protocol.\n\n\n",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 105",
      "content": "# Prop House Protocol: Public Infrastructure by Nouns DAO\n\n## Description:\n\nWhat started as an experimental approach for Nouns DAO to deploy capital has become core infrastructure to onboard and fund builders within the Nouns ecosystem. Consequently, the idea has been spreading. From [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/pg-wg-proposal-ens-small-grants/12843), to [Ape Coin](https://twitter.com/mg/status/1532551973127561223?s=20&t=Bi66tsHPt1j7tbYBvQ9iPA) to [AAVE](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1536867802501500928), communities across the broader crypto space have expressed interest in using Prop House.\n\nI propose building the Prop House Protocol as public infrastructure with the aims of it being a tool for all to use while proliferating the Nouns meme at the deepest level.\n\n## Where we are today:\n\n### Summary:\n\n- 300+ proposals submitted\n- 2,000+ votes allocated\n- 5 active houses\n- 157 ETH committed to 52 builders across 10 funding rounds\n- [prop.house](https://prop.house) UX continues to improve\n- External interest:\n  - [ENS](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/pg-wg-proposal-ens-small-grants/12843) building their own version of Prop House\n  - [Ape coin](https://twitter.com/mg/status/1532551973127561223?s=20&t=Bi66tsHPt1j7tbYBvQ9iPA) and [Aave](https://twitter.com/HelloShreyas/status/1536867802501500928) are amongst the 10+ communities that have expressed interest in setting up their own house\n- Please review the [Expenses report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iKGgedZmAzMNCFkd2PqjBd-ZgutrOjuYqfirDG1wS3g/) for an overview of all things Prop House financials\n\n### Proposals:\n\nAt the time of writing (06/18), 18 proposals have had enough time elapse since being funded to make a judgement on whether or not they executed. So far, only 1 out of 18 proposals has had a no-show. Overall, quality of proposals corresponding to amounts funded are still desirable. With the launch of Nouns Combinator (25 ETH single winner house), we hope to see more ambitious proposals be submitted.\n\n### Houses:\n\nWe are currently running 4 nounish houses with another two coming online soon:\n\n- Nouns Launchpad\n- Lil Nouns\n- NounPunks\n- Nouns Combinator\n- Nouns DAO Japan _(coming soon)_\n- SharkDAO _(coming soon)_\n\nWithin the main [Nouns house](https://prop.house/nouns-launchpad), quality has stayed consistent while proposals are averaging ~38 submissions per round:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5vpnTgd.jpg)\n\n> To view all the proposals that have been funded so far, please visit [prop.house](https://prop.house)\n\nTwo experiments were run with external houses:\n\n- Zorbs failed due to the round being endlessly spammed. Beyond the spam, there was a clear misconception in what Prop House was to be used for, hinting at more education content being needed.\n- [Mfers house](https://prop.house/mfers) has been quite a success. The [announcement tweet](https://twitter.com/nounsprophouse/status/1534967734181711880) rallied the community and the subsequent reaction points to Nouns earning goodwill as a leader in the CC0 community.\n\n## The Protocol\n\nThe protocol refers to the suite of smart contracts and open-source software that would enable anyone to run their own auctions and/or Prop House web app.\n\n### Why build the protocol in the first place?\n\nCurrently, Prop House runs as a centralized system. Each round and all of its parameters are decided on by a few people. More importantly, the Prop House multi-sig handles all the funding. As volumes grow, it increasingly becomes a risk factor.\n\nBuilding Prop House into a protocol would enable the DAO to have more control over how the capital is deployed. To illustrate, the following scenario would be possible with a live protocol:\n\n- An on-chain proposal to the DAO to set up 10 rounds at x ETH for y winners over the next 3 months\n\n### Why build it as public infrastructure?\n\nBeyond proliferating the Nouns aesthetic, I believe building public infrastructure proliferates the meme at a much deeper level hence it being the way forward.\n\n[Nouns is uniquely positioned to capture value via novel means](https://twitter.com/hongkim__/status/1533161235025260544). One of the drivers for auction demand is how aspirational the meme is. Akin to luxury goods, demand is in large part driven by psychology, not just ad spend or certain KPIs. It then follows that building public infrastructure that sets Nouns as the most forward-thinking community also contributes to auction demand.\n\nMuch more than a brand or a visual meme, Nouns is an invitation for others to join us in taking the new tools we now have at hand to rethink how we build the world around us. To that extent, public infrastructure for all is the Nounish thing to do.\n\n### To continue exploring:\n\nAlong with building the protocol, we are looking forward to:\n\n- Experimenting with bigger rounds\n- Integrating with [Snapshot](https://docs.snapshot.org/)\n- Exploring new auction formats\n  - Infinite auctions\n  - Retroactive rewards\n  - Pod and mandate specific houses\n- New nounish houses (Nouns DAO Japan, SharkDAO are coming soon)\n- Updates around the UI (past winners, voting data, etc)\n- Helping other communities onboard\n\n## Budgets\n\n### Past:\n\nTotal funded by the DAO since Dec ‚Äô21 through via proposals [23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23) & [62](https://nouns.wtf/vote/62): - 95 ETH paying Prop House contributors (~50% still remains for Jul & Aug) - 150 ETH in funding Prop House builders\n\n### Current Ask:\n\n**Operations (600 ETH):**\n\n- 100 ETH: Adds two solidity developers to payroll for remaining 2 months (July and August)\n- 440 ETH: Extends Prop House development runway by 4 months (Sept - Dec)\n  - Team on payroll consists of 2 solidity devs, 1 backend, 1 frontend and 1 designer (solimander, vapeape, devcarrot, seneca, toastee)\n- 60 ETH: Misc expenses\n  - Smart contract audits\n  - Helping Nounish communtiies get set up (e.g. Nouns DAO Japan was ~10 ETH)\n  - Operations (infura, linear figma, etc)\n\n**Funding Builders (400 ETH):**\n\n- Capital to deploy through funding auctions. We're currently at a ~80 ETH / month rate. 400 ETH would allow for 5 months of funding across all nounish houses.\n\n**TOTAL ASK: 1000 ETH (600 PH contributors, 400 for funding builders)**\n\nWith this grant, **the funds received for one year (Dec '21 - Dec '22) of Prop House discovery and development** over the three proposals would total:\n\n- 710 ETH for funding development\n- 550 ETH for funding prop builders.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- Suite of smart contracts that allow anyone to fund and deploy their own funding auctions\n- Open-source front-end for anyone to fork and run their own web app\n- Documentation to help developers and communities alike get started\n\n## Sustainability\n\nWe are exploring ways to make Prop House sustainable such that no future ask is required from Nouns DAO. While we are still open to any paths forward, one that seems plausible is creating Prop House DAO where Nouns DAO has meaningful ownership of the newly formed DAO. This would allow Nouns DAO to continue to capture any upside that comes from Prop House while aligning incentives accordingly.\n\n## Multi-sig\n\nThe multisig is currently 3/5 where the signers are seneca, devcarrot, toastee, cdt and vapeape.

      "content": "# Free Glasses For Kids v4\n\nBy Jawshua Fisher & Fitz Frames\n\ntl;dr:\nAfter completing a succesful pilot we can expand the Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription to 3,000 Kids for $300,000\n\nIn addition we can pilot a Nounish Vision Van Program with Sergul Ezurum, MD, founder of Sight For All United who will spearhead this initiative in parternship with Vision To Learn. Together we will create a high tech, Nounish Vision Van Program and execute a years worth of exams covering 3-4,000 kids for $250,000\n\n*there might be some overlap between NxFF Subscription Prescriptions and Sight For All United's program but they are not inclusive of each other.\n\nRecap: Prop 12: Nouns x Fitz Frames Free Glasses For Kids v2:\n[Nouns x Fitz Free Glasses For Kids v2](https://nouns.wtf/vote/12) was a huge success. We were able to visit 3 schools, complete 355 eye exams and dispense subscriptions for 285 kids in need, delivering a total of 391 custom fitted 3D printed Fitz Frames glasses to date.\n\nWe spent a significant effort developing Noun Frames which inspired other builders and led the way for FUN Frames and Fashion Frames to move into development.\n\nHighlights & Updates: https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/903032675043016746/920205659675439116\n\nNouns Frames Pic|326x500, 50%\n\nhttps://vimeo.com/708413500\n\nNouns x Fitz Frames FGFK v4:\nWe want to do this again, but this time let‚Äôs do more!\n\nContinuing our partnership with Fitz Frames & partnering with various vision screening and testing providers we will deliver 3,000 Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscriptions.\n\nThe Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription, which provides free glasses for kids if they lose them, break them, grow out of them or just desires a new pair because their style changed, will be expanded to 3K kids. Using a propriatery in-app measurement and delivery system Fitz Frames removes the need for in-person fittings and shapings that require specialized equipment and gets the perfect custom fit 3D printed glasses for kids individual face shape and personal style. Our goal is to keep kids in glasses that fit and they're proud to wear, even as they change throughout the year.\n\nExpanding the scale of this program will get us one step closer to our moon shot of creating a system where individual doctors around the world can plug in to and get free glasses for kids in need through the Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription program.\n\nAs a pivot from a Nationwide Sponsorship for Vision To Learn we have the opportunity to work hand in hand with Sight For All United on launching a new Vision Van Program complete with a brand new van that we can collaborate together on to make it as Nounish as possible. This will allow us to peek under the hood, literally, at how Vision To Learn works and the impact these programs deliver to communities where they are available.\n\nNouns X Fitz Prescription Subscription - $300,000\nNounish Vision Van - $250,000\n\nPHASES OF EXECUTION\nPHASE 1:\n150K - Fitz Frames\n150K - Nounish Vision Van Program / Sergul\n\nPHASE 2: Fund second 50% of proposed allocation\n150K - After delivery of 1K Prescription Subscriptions\n100K - Nounish Vision Van Program - Paid upon delivery of the Van\n\nSend $575K (~550ETH) equivalent of ETH to Fitz Frames Gnosis from v2.

Will deterimine on a case by case basis which partners can deliver which items.\n\n\n\nFOR REFERENCE: Prop 12\nNounsDAO Grant Proposal\n\nBy Joshua Fisher & Fitz Frames\ntl;dr\nIn celebration of the fact that every Noun is a glasses wearer, Fitz Frames would like to propose a perpetual funding allocation to deliver prescription eyeglasses to children in need.\n\nFitz Frames in partnership with Vision to Learn (as well as additional outreach partners) can deliver a no-cost eye exam plus an annual membership to Fitz Frames for children in need. A Fitz Frames membership includes two complete pairs of prescription eyeglasses with unlimited replacement frames should they lose, break, grow out of the glasses, or their prescription changes.\n\nIn addition to their Fitz Frames Membership each child will receive an additional free pair of Noun Frames, glasses that mimic the pair worn by their favorite Noun.\n\nAs an initial pilot program, we propose Nouns DAO allocate 9ETH (~$30,000 worth of ETH) to provide glasses to approximately 300 kids (aprox $100) per child. This will be done with in conjunction with our outreach partner Vision to Learn in an initial focus geography (probably Ohio and/or Detroit). Progress reports will be given to NounsDAO on an ongoing basis, but no less than once a quarter. The pilot program is expected to run approximately 90 days, but children will continue to receive replacement glasses for the full year as needed. The purpose of the pilot program is to validate and refine the offering and delivery process, with the goal of expanding the efforts nationwide and eventually internationally.\n\nAt the end of the initial pilot program, Fitz present the results of the program and will put to a vote either a continuation, expansion, or termination of the program.\n\nAdditionally, we request 2ETH in one-time funding to build outreach materials (print, animation, and website) directed towards schools to explain the program, Nouns, Fitz, and the underlying technology of blockchain, NFTs, and additive manufacturing.\n\nProposal\nFitz would like to eventually build to a perpetual funding mechanism in order to expand our existing social good efforts and deliver eyewear on an ongoing basis to kids in need. In the interim, we‚Äôd like to propose a pilot program to prove out the model and refine delivery mechanism:\n\n$30K allocation from Nouns treasury to provide approximately 300 no-cost vision tests plus Fitz Frames memberships to kids in need, initially in a limited geographical focus area.\n\nFitz will provide annual memberships at cost of $100)/kid/year discounted from $185. Annual Membership consists of two pairs of custom fit glasses plus unliminted replacements.\n\nFitz will provide an additional free pair of Noun Frames, mimicking their favorite Nouns, limited to an initial selection of 10 Noun options for the Pilot Program.\n\nVision to Learn, will identify recipients and provide no-cost eye exams within the geographical focus area. Initial prospects are Ohio and Detroit.\n\nInitial Pilot Program is expected to run approximately 90 days, at which point Fitz will present a report of progress to the NounsDAO.\nAt that point the NounsDAO can vote to expand, continue, or suspend the pilot program.\n\nBased on findings from the initial Pilot Program, elements can be refined including: delivery mechanism, offering, and outreach. Additionally, Fitz Frames will work to try and secure additional underwriting in order to extend the reach of the program. (possibly through Medicaid reimbursement, or local philanthropic partners)\n\nIn order to promote the program (and help surface Nouns to a wider public awareness) we propose dedicating an additional 2ETH to develop outreach materials including print, short form animation, and a dedicated website. This will target schools, the student recipients of glasses, and broader public. In addition to promotion of the program, this is an opportunity to introduce the technology elements underpinning both Nouns and Fitz Frames, and develop age-appropriate STEM curriculum for the kids who receive the glasses.\n\nNouns is a fantastic example of people leveraging technology to come together and build long-term value in perpetuity. Fitz leverages the power of technology to change the lives of kids. We think this is a natural partnership that would not only do a tremendous amount of good, but could serve as tangible application of blockchain doing tangible good. At Fitz, we believe that those who can see the world are the ones who can change the world. NounsDAO embodies this ethos completely, and we couldn‚Äôt imagine a better partner.\n\nNoun Frames\nFitz will integrate Nouns Frames into their application so that users can pick their favorite Noun and receive glasses that mimic those frames as well as have the Noun itself printed on the side of the frames as well as the Noun number printed on the inside.\n\nAbout Fitz:\nFitz Frames: https://www.fitzframes.com/\nFitz for Good - how Fitz has worked with VTL to provide glasses for kids in the past:\nhttps://vimeo.com/377468371\nHow Fitz has worked with Healthcare community to provide protective prescription eyewear to drs and nurses across the country - https://news.yahoo.com/local-hero-nyc-glasses-maker-171104609.html\nFitz in the Press - How we came to be and why we matter to kids - https://abcnews.go.com/Business/startup-offers-affordable-eyeglasses-kids-flatter-faces/story?id=65014415\n\nAbout Vision 2 Learn:\nhttps://visiontolearn.org/about/from-the-founder/",

There are 13 bridges for cars, subways, trains, and pedestrians.\n\n### Objective\n- Promote NounsDAO via online and offline engagement.\n- Get local media coverage (Invite newspaper and TV journalists)\n\n### Location: Hangang river, Seoul, South Korea\n### Date & Time: September 17-18th, 8:00 ~ 18:00\n- September 17th: Kimpo Airport‚ÜíGangnam\n- September 18th: Gangnam‚ÜíKimpo Airport\n*(The exact date and time might be changed in case of logistics delays or bad weather)*\n\n### Map\n![https://media.giphy.com/media/PS8lP8bBk0ICeuIYJE/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/PS8lP8bBk0ICeuIYJE/giphy.gif)\n\n###  Description\n- J/24 sailboat is the most famous sailboat model of all time! I propose to display nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of Seoul, South Korea. Seoul is home to 15+ million people and a lot of interest in blockchain and NFTs among the population. The Korean government, businesses, and people are interested in blockchain and the NFT space. Hangang river is surrounded by two highways and will be a perfect place to reach many people during rush hours. The two-way distance will be around 40+ kilometers. This could be a great opportunity to advertise NounsDAO and attract potential future members and developers.\n- I know lots of sailors who want to participate in the Nouns Seoul PR campaign. I will create a fleet of five J/24 sailboats and sail along the river from Kimpo international airport to Itaewon bridge and back. This event is going to be organized for NounsDAO. There will be only 5 sailboats with spinnakers with painted Nouns Glasses logos.\n- The idea is to make as many people remember Nouns-glasses. Images of Nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of the river will spark curiosity in the minds of the bypassers. This campaign is not a spam-like poster or post that many of us learned to ignore without noticing. People would remember Nouns glasses and later when they attend a conference or buy NFTs they would recognize the Nouns symbol and would eventually come straight to the NounsDAO!\n- The spinnakers are big and span an area of 8 meters in height and 4 meters in width. After the regatta, I think the best use for sails is to give them to the sailing teams. There are about five good regattas every year in Korea, I will provide more content free of charge when we race at different events with the Nouns-themed sails. I am sure pretty spinnakers with Nouns Glasses would be appreciated by the teams and be used for many years!\n\n### Spinnaker sail designs\nI have connections to Hyde sails dealership and can place an expedited order for 5 spinnaker sails with printed logo of the nouns glasses. The Nouns glasses will be permanently spray-painted at the sail makers factory.\n\n![https://media.giphy.com/media/D1jMwyeglLc0sntg2A/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/D1jMwyeglLc0sntg2A/giphy.gif)\n\n### Newspapers and local TV\nWe are going to send invitations to local newspapers and TV stations. Hopefully, local media will feature Nouns DAO as a multi-national NFT & blockchain project that builds the future of web3 and supports various projects.\n\n#### Talking points for media interviews\n- What are NFT, DAO, Blockchain\n    - basic info\n- How is NounsDAO different from other projects?\n    - the intersection of arts and technology\n    - culture and governance\n    - traits, rarity, prices\n- Information on auction, treasury, DAO mechanics\n    - 24-hour autonomous action\n    - All proceedings go to the treasury\n    - How DAO decides to spend treasury\n- Who are Nounders, Nouners, Nouncillors, Prop builders\n    - Nounders - Nouns founders\n    - Nouners - Nouns owners\n    - Nouncillors - Nouns councillors\n    - Prop builders - Nouns builders \n- What projects were funded\n    - social, charity, advertisenment, etc \n- How to join (buy a noun, propose a project, connect with the community)\n    - Buy a noun on an auction or aftermarket\n    - Propose project on discourse (NounsDAO or Small grants), find prop sponsor, etc\n    - Where to find info and how to connect to the community (twitter spaces, noun-o-clock, discord, etc )\n\n### Roadmap\n- Spinnaker sails delivery in 2 months.\n- Photos from the sailing campaign will be available the next day\n- Videos will be available in 1 week\n\n### Budget 25 ETH\n- 12 ETH will be used to get 5 spinnakers with a painted Nouns Glasses logos (This cost was 10 eth in prop99. Requesting additional 2 ETH due to price volatility)\n\t- Price of one spinnaker sail is $2,000\n\t- Cost to paint a logo is $300\n\t- Delivery fee is $100\n- 2 ETH prizes to teams (aka compensation for effort and time)\n    - Five teams (5 sailors per boat) on five J/24 sailboats will join the Nouns fleet\n\t- Upon completion spinnaker sails will be given to the teams as compensation for their time and further proliferation of Nouns in local regattas.\n- 2.5 ETH rent two motor boats for safety & media\n- 2.5 ETH compensation to two video/photo operators (stills, video, and drone footage)\n- 2 ETH compensation for my efforts. In the case of ETH prices going down, the money will be used to offset the expenses\n- 1 ETH food & drinks for teams (two days)\n- 1 ETH nounish team t-shirts (30 t-shirts)\n- 1 ETH boat lift for 5 boats (launch boats to the river and put back on land)\n- 1 ETH boats mooring fee at the river (one night)\n\n### Team\nproposed by [https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev](https://twitter.com/fiveoceans_dev) aka [https://twitter.com/NounsNation](https://twitter.com/NounsNation) and Korean J/24 & J/70 sailing teams.\n\n![https://media.giphy.com/media/prXoOPfP1xSxTKSX1w/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/prXoOPfP1xSxTKSX1w/giphy.gif)\n\n### ETH wallet:\n0x3e6791170d9514be84B5A1C17c217a0BFfc60976\n\n\n\n",

We were able to visit 3 schools, complete 355 eye exams and dispense subscriptions for 285 kids in need, delivering a total of 391 custom fitted 3D printed Fitz Frames glasses to date. \n\nWe spent a significant effort developing Noun Frames which inspired other builders and led the way for FUN Frames and Fashion Frames to move into development.  \n\nHighlights & Updates: https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/903032675043016746/920205659675439116\n\n![Nouns Frames Pic|326x500, 50%](upload://6QoMt9y1XuK7I7hMMyxEbLYP5R7.jpeg) \n\nhttps://vimeo.com/708413500\n\n\n# Nouns x Fitz Frames FGFK v4:\nWe want to do this again, but this time let‚Äôs do more! \n\nContinuing our partnership with Fitz Frames & partnering with various vision screening and testing providers we will deliver **3,000** Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscriptions. \n\nThe Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription, which provides free glasses for kids if they lose them, break them, grow out of them or just desires a new pair because their style changed, will be expanded to 3K kids. Using a propriatery in-app measurement and delivery system Fitz Frames removes the need for in-person fittings and shapings that require specialized equipment and gets the perfect custom fit 3D printed glasses for kids individual face shape and personal style. Our goal is to keep kids in glasses that fit and they're proud to wear, even as they change throughout the year. \n\nExpanding the scale of this program will get us one step closer to our moon shot of creating a system where individual doctors around the world can plug in to and get free glasses for kids in need through the Nouns X Fitz Frames Prescription Subscription program.\n\nAs a pivot from a Nationwide Sponsorship for Vision To Learn we have the opportunity to work hand in hand with Sight For All United on launching a new Vision Van Program complete with a brand new van that we can collaborate together on to make it as Nounish as possible. This will allow us to peek under the hood, literally, at how Vision To Learn works and the impact these programs deliver to communities where they are available. \n\n### Nouns X Fitz Prescription Subscription - $300,000 \n### Nounish Vision Van - $250,000\n\n<br>\n\n## PHASES OF EXECUTION\n\n### PHASE 1: \n* 150K - Fitz Frames\n* 150K - Nounish Vision Van Program / Sergul\n\n### PHASE 2: Fund second 50% of proposed allocation\n* 150K - After delivery of 1K Prescription Subscriptions \n* 100K - Nounish Vision Van Program - Paid upon delivery of the Van\n\nSend $550K (~500ETH) equivalent of ETH to Fitz Frames Gnosis from v2.

A Fitz Frames membership includes two complete pairs of prescription eyeglasses with unlimited replacement frames should they lose, break, grow out of the glasses, or their prescription changes.\n\nIn addition to their Fitz Frames Membership each child will receive an additional free pair of Noun Frames, glasses that mimic the pair worn by their favorite Noun.\n\nAs an initial pilot program, we propose Nouns DAO allocate 9ETH (~$30,000 worth of ETH) to provide glasses to approximately 300 kids (aprox $100) per child. This will be done with in conjunction with our outreach partner Vision to Learn in an initial focus geography (probably Ohio and/or Detroit). Progress reports will be given to NounsDAO on an ongoing basis, but no less than once a quarter. The pilot program is expected to run approximately 90 days, but children will continue to receive replacement glasses for the full year as needed. The purpose of the pilot program is to validate and refine the offering and delivery process, with the goal of expanding the efforts nationwide and eventually internationally.\n\nAt the end of the initial pilot program, Fitz present the results of the program and will put to a vote either a continuation, expansion, or termination of the program.\n\nAdditionally, we request 2ETH in one-time funding to build outreach materials (print, animation, and website) directed towards schools to explain the program, Nouns, Fitz, and the underlying technology of blockchain, NFTs, and additive manufacturing.\n\nProposal\nFitz would like to eventually build to a perpetual funding mechanism in order to expand our existing social good efforts and deliver eyewear on an ongoing basis to kids in need. In the interim, we‚Äôd like to propose a pilot program to prove out the model and refine delivery mechanism:\n\n$30K allocation from Nouns treasury to provide approximately 300 no-cost vision tests plus Fitz Frames memberships to kids in need, initially in a limited geographical focus area.\n\nFitz will provide annual memberships at cost of $100)/kid/year discounted from $185. Annual Membership consists of two pairs of custom fit glasses plus unliminted replacements.\n\nFitz will provide an additional free pair of Noun Frames, mimicking their favorite Nouns, limited to an initial selection of 10 Noun options for the Pilot Program.\n\nVision to Learn, will identify recipients and provide no-cost eye exams within the geographical focus area. Initial prospects are Ohio and Detroit.\n\nInitial Pilot Program is expected to run approximately 90 days, at which point Fitz will present a report of progress to the NounsDAO.\nAt that point the NounsDAO can vote to expand, continue, or suspend the pilot program.\n\nBased on findings from the initial Pilot Program, elements can be refined including: delivery mechanism, offering, and outreach. Additionally, Fitz Frames will work to try and secure additional underwriting in order to extend the reach of the program. (possibly through Medicaid reimbursement, or local philanthropic partners)\n\nIn order to promote the program (and help surface Nouns to a wider public awareness) we propose dedicating an additional 2ETH to develop outreach materials including print, short form animation, and a dedicated website. This will target schools, the student recipients of glasses, and broader public. In addition to promotion of the program, this is an opportunity to introduce the technology elements underpinning both Nouns and Fitz Frames, and develop age-appropriate STEM curriculum for the kids who receive the glasses.\n\nNouns is a fantastic example of people leveraging technology to come together and build long-term value in perpetuity. Fitz leverages the power of technology to change the lives of kids. We think this is a natural partnership that would not only do a tremendous amount of good, but could serve as tangible application of blockchain doing tangible good. At Fitz, we believe that those who can see the world are the ones who can change the world. NounsDAO embodies this ethos completely, and we couldn‚Äôt imagine a better partner.\n\nNoun Frames\nFitz will integrate Nouns Frames into their application so that users can pick their favorite Noun and receive glasses that mimic those frames as well as have the Noun itself printed on the side of the frames as well as the Noun number printed on the inside.\n\nAbout Fitz:\nFitz Frames: https://www.fitzframes.com/\nFitz for Good - how Fitz has worked with VTL to provide glasses for kids in the past:\nhttps://vimeo.com/377468371\nHow Fitz has worked with Healthcare community to provide protective prescription eyewear to drs and nurses across the country - https://news.yahoo.com/local-hero-nyc-glasses-maker-171104609.html\nFitz in the Press - How we came to be and why we matter to kids - https://abcnews.go.com/Business/startup-offers-affordable-eyeglasses-kids-flatter-faces/story?id=65014415\n\nAbout Vision 2 Learn:\nhttps://visiontolearn.org/about/from-the-founder/",

      "content": "# The Noun Square: A Daily Noun O' Clock Celebration\n\n## Summary\n\n- [The Noun Square](https://twitter.com/noun_o_clock) is a daily Twitter Spaces ritual celebrating Noun O' Clock (NOC) in a fun and engaging format.\n- Spearheaded by [Toady Hawk](https://twitter.com/toady_hawk), [Ser Noadz](https://twitter.com/thenoadz) and myself ([142](https://twitter.com/1fortytwo)). Administered by a thriving and growing community (join our [discord](https://discord.gg/qsUk2v4ZB3)!).\n- We've completed a 14 day pilot of daily spaces and contests every day, with excellent results.\n\n### Pilot Metrics\n-  ~110 daily attendees, 60+ daily FOMO players \n- 500+ twitter followers (up from 0)\n- 250K tweet impressions (!!) \n- 200+ pieces of nounish content produced in 9 daily contests \n- 400+ POAPs claimed for attending the spaces\n- 11 special nounish guests\n\n### Short term goals\n- Grow attendance & engagement\n- Iterate on show format and deepen our \"show/market fit\"\n- Grow our community of hosts and contributors \n\n### Longer term goals\n- Make NOC a global Internet shared moment\n- Grow reach to thousands of concurrent participants, and later much much more\n\n### Our Ask\n- We are asking for 55 ETH total to continue this initiative for a 1 month period.\n- Doing this daily is a lot of work (about 10 man-hour a day on average. More detailed breakdown below.)\n    - 10 ETH will be earmarked for contests themed around the Noun of the day. \n    - 45 ETH will go to community contributor rewards (biweekly retro rewards administered by CoordinApe rounds, modeled after Nouncil.)\n\n\n---\n\n## Who We Are\n\nWe are a community of Nounish builders setting out to create a Daily Celebration of Noun O‚Äô Clock called The Noun Square, administered by a Nouncil-like body and with the goal of proliferating Nouns by turning Noun O‚Äô Clock into a ‚ÄúShared Moment‚Äù for the entire Internet. We have successfully completed two week pilot using a combination of Small Grants and out-of-pocket funds for prizes (data from which which has informed this proposal)   \n\n## Our vision\n\nFor anyone who grew up in the 70s, 80s or 90s, ‚ÄúThe Price is Right‚Äù holds a special place in our collective psyche. For over 50 years, its daily blend of ritual and play has entertained hundreds of thousands of people the world over.  We believe Noun O‚Äô Clock can recreate this kind of shared experience for web3.\n\n**Broad Goals:**\n\n- **Turn NOC into a daily shared global moment** - develop a grass-root, organic, daily show that introduces more people to  nouns & its thriving community & sub-communities. As well as creates a space in which our growing community can meet daily and share a live moment together.\n\n\n- **Model our community on Nouncil** - a collective of builders all over the globe with varied skillsets, collaborating to organize and administer a daily Twitter Spaces. We think that a decentralized community model can be the nounish way to scale a Noun O' Clock show! \n\n- **Be consistent (‚Äùone NOC, every day, forever‚Äù)** - Even in the deep NOC winter, we believe consistency is key to cementing NOC as a daily celebration for the Internet. We are planning ahead for this with hosts from all over the world.\n\n\n## The (Current) Format\n\n- Begin 15 min before NOC every day.\n- Contest review & announcements.\n- Casual guest interview while watching/discussing end of daily Noun auction.\n- Play FOMO Live together (we invite as many attendees as possible to come on stage and keep mics open for an interactive experience.)\n- Give live Secret Word for those who wish to collect POAP for attendance.\n\n*On weekends, we run a LITE version of The Noun Square featring only FOMO live, hosted by a different nounish community every Saturday (e.g. Lil Nouns and GOOP DAO the past two weeks, future guest hosts Nouns DAO Japan, Korean Noun Fans, NounPunks, FloriNouns, etc.)\n\n## The Team: 3 C's\n\n**Core Team (Responsible for Execution):**\n- Toady Hawk\n- Noun 142\n- Ser Noadz\n\n**Council (Responsible for Decisions and Daily Direction)**\n\n- SuperTightWoody\n- Goldy\n- Joshua Fisher\n- Maty\n- Benbodhi\n- !Xargs\n- Sam Ellis\n- Aubtoshi\n- RyanMac21\n\n**Community (Talent Funnel for Council)**\n- Growing Discord Community\n\n## Growing the community\n\n- We want to grow the community and **build in the open.** We have created a Discord server [open to anyone who wants to contribute.](https://discord.gg/qsUk2v4ZB3) We have also created a public Google Sheet that tracks our progress and metrics and future plans for [anyone to follow along](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zmEFFLxUszyKZzo8CJP6KlXC581NkPLtek4GN6h7T8/edit?usp=sharing).\n- Hosting a live Spaces every day is an audacious goal (albeit one we are excited about), and will require participation and help from Nounsfolk in all timezones, especially as NOC drifts into the North American Night.\n\n## Compensation Model\n\nOur ask for the next 30 days is 55 ETH:\n\n- **Contest rewards (0.5 eth/day * 20 weekdays = 10 ETH)**\n    - We will experiment with these numbers and the cadence of them as we move forward, but so far this amount and cadence has produced excellent participation.\n\n- **Team reward + operations (see budget below): 45 ETH**\n    - Because we intend to build this initiative as a community effort, we will be modeling our team reward, at least for the first period, on Nouncil‚Äôs proven model of a Coordinape round, where all active participants will allocate tokens based on contributions.** We think this will ultimately be a fairer and more frictionless way of properly rewarding the team than attempting to itemize every hour of effort, etc.\n\n    - Based on our pilot, we  estimated how many man-hours it takes to run a show like this every day. We think these are reasonable overall estimates. \n    \n    \n![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wj7gtHWz/image.png)\n![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/RZk5Nt61/image.png)\n\n## Multi-sig\nFunds will go a new 3/6 gnosis safe, with the following signers:\n\n- 142\n- Toadyhawk.eth\n- maty.eth\n- SuperTightWoody\n- Ser Noadz\n- Benbodhi\n\n\n\n# Two-week Pilot Results\n\n### Twitter analytics\n\nMassive reach within 14 days!\n\n![twitter-analytics-noc-jun-26.png](https://i.postimg.cc/1XK4RJYb/twitter-analytics-noc-jun-26.png)\n\n\n### Space Participation\n\n\n- Attendance has been growing every day to average around 115 people a day.\n- We hit FOMO players ATH at 110 on our first pilot space and have been averaging between 60-70 every day.\n- Twitter growing by approximately 30 followers per day so far.\n- Averaging 30 entries to our daily contest, with many high quality submissions.\n    - NB: Small Grants sponsored our first Week of contest prizes (thank you!) Noun Square Team members Toady Hawk and 142 have agreed to fund the current week‚Äôs prizes out of pocket to keep morale high pending approval or disapproval of this broader proposal.\n    \n![tracking-document-screenshot-noc.png](https://i.postimg.cc/wBbGZzqG/tracking-document-screenshot-noc.png)\n    \n(Excerpt Above from our [Public Tracking/Planning Document.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-zmEFFLxUszyKZzo8CJP6KlXC581NkPLtek4GN6h7T8/edit?usp=sharing))\n\n\n### The Contests\n\nInspired by 4156 ad-hoc contests a few weeks back, we have run 10 contests with really great engagement and wonderful creativity from noun lovers on twitter: \n![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/ncsnrpSJ/image.png)\n\n![bag-found-art.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/fyB659r6/bag-found-art.jpg)\n\n\n![crown-haikus.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/SNZhfB0J/crown-haikus.jpg)\n\n\n### Gamifying NOC with POAPs\n\nWe are using POAPs to gamify NOC and create both engagement and loyalty. We feel that our use of Daily Attendance POAPs is the purest use case for the tech (literally ‚ÄúProof of Attendance‚Äù) and we want to use them to incentivize people to attend Noun O‚Äô Clock every single day if they can. \n\nSo far, it‚Äôs working! Ser Noadz has been creating amazing daily animated POAPs based on the new Noun of the Day and would continue to do so for the first month (after which we would explore other ‚ÄúSeries‚Äù by other Nounish artists.) \n\n![IMG-2420.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/brHXK5FS/IMG-2420.jpg)\n\nWe also want to experiment with doing bonuses like physical Merch drops for those with provable streaks of attendance, and raffles that are easier to win the more times you have attended. \n\nExample Possible ‚ÄúThe Noun Square‚Äù Merch Drop for Attendance Streaks:\n\n[![noc-cap-smallest.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FK6V4gf9/noc-cap-smallest.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/FfjLbSgq)\n\n\n## Playing FOMO\n\nThe peak moment of The Noun Square is, of course, playing FOMO live and minting a new Noun together. When FOMO starts during the Twitter Space, we ask all speakers to unmute and speak their mind, to create as much chaos, interaction and fun as possible. The feedback so far has been that people have been loving it!  \n\nWe have noticed anecdotally that FOMO seems to take longer on average with more players, until we hit that beautiful noun that reaches some consensus. We think the Nouns minted over the past week or so are especially legendary, and believe it‚Äôs related to our efforts to gamify FOMO and bring in new players.\n\nThe impressive roster of Nouns minted by FOMO since we started: \n\n[![this-is-a-subliminal-message-to-vote-yes-on-our-proposal-lol.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/bYmCCbgw/this-is-a-subliminal-message-to-vote-yes-on-our-proposal-lol.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/NLrkLKZ3)\n\n\n\n## Our plan for the next 30 days\n\n- **Host a Noun o‚Äô Clock every. single. day.**\n- **Make it fun & intereting:** Run a contests, and have guests for every weekday\n- **Be inclusive:** Invite a different nounish extension, subdao or community to host every weekend.\n- **Grow the NOC community:** Invite as many interested Nounsfolk to join our Discord and share ideas, volunteer to help where they can.\n- **Curate an Organizational Committee**: will handles all the day to day tasks to keep this going in a decentralized manner.\n- **Run a Coordinape round:** At the end of each 15 day period, reward contributors by Coordinape Round.\n\n**Grow our reach:**\n- **500k Tweet impressions** on our @noun_o_clock Twitter account.\n- **1000+ Twitter following** \n- Grow daily show attendance to 125 per day, and average FOMO Players to 85+.\n- Produce over 800 unique pieces of Nounish content in the form of public entries to our Noun O‚Äô Clock contests. \n- Teach hundreds of new people about Nouns and Noun o‚Äô Clock through our informative and entertaining spaces.\n\n**Potential challenges**\n\n1. July gets into very late night EST and we may have fewer participants. However, we believe that consistency is key, as well as the opportunity to get more people from non-north america timezones to hear about nouns.\n2. Over-saturation is a risk of course, as with anything that happens daily. But as with The Price is Right, we hope to create a shared ritual with the community we are building, such that the daily show is something they look forward to, rather than a chore they get bored of. We are building variety into the structure of the show, with a mixture of weekly segments and novel guests and contests to keep things interesting for many, many months (and hopefully longer!) \n\n**In Conclusion:**\n\nOver the past two weeks, we have kicked off a tradition of making Noun O‚Äô Clock a daily celebration, featuring live Twitter Spaces, interactive contests and special guests. So far, people love it. (See feedback section below)\n\nWe believe that, if given funding to execute our vision detailed here, we can bring new attention to Nouns and the daily auction every day, while also supporting extension and sub-DAO communities, and engaging active Nounish builders. \n\n**Let‚Äôs work together to make Noun O‚Äô Clock into a shared moment for the Internet!**\n\n**Feedback from attendees has been great:**\n\n> ‚ÄúThe Noun Square gives a much needed voice to what is Nounish. A platform to congregate daily, learn and vibe, uniting Nounsfolk, and beyond, around the world!‚Äù *-Metamonk*\n> \n\n> ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt watch TV anymore, but I do miss the days when I would spend my evenings with David Letterman on the Late Show. It was home to me. And that is what the Noun O‚Äô Clock team are doing right now. **It definitely feels like home to me.** ‚Äù *-Leo Clark*\n> \n\n> ‚ÄúThis event is now something that I want to do every single day.  I am literally trying to figure out how to turn over my entire family's sleep schedule! Getting to hear my Nounish frens and what they are up to is amazing. **This event has also proven to be a wonderful way for me to onboard new folks into Nouns.** I leave this every day with dozens of new and Nounish ideas, and feeling great and motivated.‚Äù *-!xargs*\n> \n\n> ‚Äú**Having a common and consistent place to gather for a Noun O‚Äô Clock event is something folks need**--a kind of programming schedule that they can tap into every day. The engagement events have been fun and accessible and rotating guests have been a good way to introduce folks to extension projects while celebrating the nouns in general! The POAPS are great and give a feeling of being part of the history of the noun minted that day..‚Äù *-Sam Ellis*\n> \n\n> ‚ÄúFor a couple months, I‚Äôve tried to touch base in the Discord during FOMO as a fun way to interact with those in the Nouns eco system. **Having this extended virtual event via Spaces has taken that to a whole new level!** The Spaces, the guests (David Horvath!), the games, the prizes and the POAPs all bring different aspects of interaction, energy and motivation to attend.  Unlike 20 years ago, we rarely have shared cultural experiences as a society anymore (think TV show series finales etc.) **We have an opportunity to create one here that is open to everyone to enjoy on a global scale.** How exciting!‚Äù *- Prof Werder*\n>",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 100",
      "content": "Make Nouns VISIBLE FROM SPACE + Ubiquitous at the Largest Charity Beer Garden & Tailgate in the Country\n\nLink w/ Images: https://nouns.wtf/vote/100\n\nDescription\nWe respectfully seek Nouns support to maintain public access to a well-established charity beer garden just steps from the largest stadium in the country (#3 in the world). In return, we offer extraordinary Nouns visibility ‚Äî from the ground, the air, even from space‚Äî to eight of the largest event crowds of the year. The iconic Nouns glasses will be omnipresent, allowing Nouns to make a great first impression on a vast new audience mostly unfamiliar with NFTs or DAOs.\n\nWe will literally put Nouns on the map and make them part of the permanent record ‚Äî the first NFT/PFP icon visible from Earth orbit ‚Äî when Nouns glasses appear in updated satellite maps (Google Earth/Maps, etc.), visible to everyone at the event, near the event, or simply looking for directions near a major university and sports destination.\n\nI founded the Cancer Support Community charity beer garden after my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. I ran it for years as an out-of-pocket labor of love. We were attracting tens of thousands of patrons each season and potential sponsors were taking notice when the pandemic shut everything down. Unable to continue funding on my own, I sold to an LLC but I retained an ownership share that allows me a chance to preserve the community event. I'm looking for an open-minded and nimble capital source to help the beer garden remain open to the public this fall while sponsors budget for FY2023. When @4156 tweeted an invitation (see below), it was clear that a DAO could be our saving grace. Relatively modest support could positively affect thousands of lives with a MONUMENTAL return on investment for the Nouns community.\n\nBenefits to Nouns\n\nMAKE NOUNS VISIBLE FROM SPACE ‚Äî massive Nouns glasses will be emblazoned on a synthetic turf installation. At 60 feet wide, they will be large enough to be visible when satellite maps are updated, meaning they'll become part of the permanent record, obvious to anyone on site and to anyone using Google Earth/Maps or other online navigation tools near the largest stadium in the country and a top university. Because synthetic turf doesn't require cutting and won't wear down under foot, the glasses can stay as long as it takes for the next satellite maps update.\n\n\nNouns billboard/banner ‚Äî 12-foot Nouns glasses will watch over the crowd, evident not only to the thousands of beer garden guests but unmistakable, even at a distance, to the tens of thousands walking past on game day.\n\n\nNouns pole banners ‚Äî Nouns ubiquity continues as glasses appear in pairs on pole banners flying high above the crowd.\n\n\nDrone photos + press release ‚Äî a licensed drone photographer will capture images of the multitude of Nouns glasses in situ to accompany a press release describing the event and directing people to learn more about Nouns DAO.\n\nTBD special event ‚Äî plans are in motion to turn the night game on September 10 into an extended affair to remember with music stage and celebrity appearances.\n\nAnd more ‚Äî Nouns glasses and URL on event signage, pint cups, staff t-shirts, event website, press release, social media, etc.\n\nWhat does this mean for Nouns?\n\nProliferation and public relations on a colossal scale: The eight-game event season will put Nouns in front of more new eyes than any other event. Unlike NFT-oriented gatherings where attendees are familiar with Nouns (e.g., NFT.NYC), sponsorship at the largest normie events of the year will introduce an entirely new population to the DAO in a positive and productive light ‚Äî doing good for the community. There are incredible opportunities to expand Nouns brand recognition with in-person visitors immersed in Nouns iconography and countless others learning the Nouns story through media coverage of events.\n\nNounish culture: what better way to reinforce the Nouns ethos than to support an inclusive community event and serve as ambassadors to the web3 ecosystem.\n\nDiversity: there's no other event like this. Nouns would be on the vanguard of DAO philanthropy, supporting the largest charity event of its kind. In return, Nouns would be the first NFT/PFP visible from earth orbit.\n\nSuccessful track record: this isn't a request to gamble on our success, it's a well-established event looking to remain publicly accessible in its post-pandemic return. Since it began in 2016, the beer garden has attracted tens of thousands of patrons each season and grossed six figures for charity.\n\nWho else is involved?\nNouns DAO will join a roster of CONFIRMED partners. We're still negotiating sponsorships with a few other key players (\"TBA\" below). We've already pitched DAO membership to some of them and plan to invite the others to join us in the web3 space. Ideally, the event series will grow in subsequent seasons with support from new high-profile Nouns DAO members.\n\nTruly Hard Seltzer ‚Äî the #2 player in the hard seltzer category will expand beer garden options for thirsty patrons.\n\n\nTwisted Tea ‚Äî The #1 contender in the FMB sector will add even more depth to the drink lineup.\n\n\nSlows Bar BQ ‚Äî Detroit's finest barbecue has been featured every season since 2016 and their food truck will be back this fall with premium tailgate fare.\n\n\nZingerman's Creamery (& coffee) ‚Äî the creamery arm of Zingerman's Deli, one of the best in the Midwest, will provide gelato and/or hot coffee/cocoa depending on the game day weather forecast.\n\n\nHotaling & Co. ‚Äî their whiskey warehouse survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire long before they became a leader in super-premium artisanal spirits; they will augment the drink menu with custom cocktails, including a signature drink created for the occasion.\n\n\n**Cancer Support Community** ‚Äî the local chapter of the national 501(c)(3) non-profit organization is our co-host, securing the state special permit for alcohol service at the beer garden; CSC volunteers staff the event and pour drinks.\n\n\nTBA national brand soft drink partner ‚Äî the largest distributor for the #1 soft drink brand in the US has signed on to provide non-alcoholic options. We're still lobbying for a partnership with the cola giant. Stay tuned.\n\nTBA national brand beer partner ‚Äî we're in conversations with a leading national beer brand portfolio and hope to see them become a major sponsor and the next prominent beverage company to join Nouns DAO.\n\nTBA we're chatting with, but still have to confirm, a premium handmade Vodka out of Austin, TX to supplement our cocktail lineup\n\nWe've snagged DJ WaltAmore (house DJ at Tin Roof, Detroit) to spin for us this season\n\nWe've engaged the services of a sports marketing professional with experience in charitable event planning for organizations, pro athletes, and their non-profit endeavors. More info TBA.\n\nWhat does this mean to the charity? What happens if the proposal fails?\nIn short, Nouns support provides a stay of execution for the publicly accessible event. Without sponsor support to maintain community access, the charity beer garden will not return in 2022. Instead, the site will be turned over to private and corporate interests. It's a manifestation of the conflict between web2 and web3...centralized ownership versus open access.\n\nA successful DAO vote means the charity event sees new life plus a foundation for future growth. As in the past, 100% of beer/seltzer/FMB/cocktail sales will benefit Cancer Support Community programming: education; counseling; financial assistance; healthy living (exercise, stress management, nutrition) programming; social activities for adults, teens and children; and other CSC fundraising events. Enthusiastic national brands are poised to underwrite the future of the series but, in the middle of a fiscal cycle, budget dollars have already been allocated. Nouns sponsorship this fall would provide a bridge to next season when beverage and other brand sponsors can earmark funds for their participation.\n\nIn sports entertainment marketing circles, this location is a unicorn. Of roughly two dozen properties covered by a city council resolution granting broad game day allowances to specific properties in the stadium vicinity, it's the only available vacant parcel this large. Sponsorship value has been estimated by sports marketing agencies at $12-18/sqft per game based on site characteristics, recent team performance, and media coverage that accompanies the nationally televised events around which the beer garden is scheduled.\n\nProximity to venue ‚Äî 285 yards to stadium gate\nGenerous open space ‚Äî over 10,000 square feet\nPrivately owned ‚Äî no municipal or university red tape\nExisting municipal approvals for game day sales and commercial display\nNo neighbors to complain ‚Äî no residential units within 400 feet\nHaving a respected and successful history here, the charity event has a right of first refusal to remain...but only if we can secure a sponsor. If we continue, the beer garden will offer the closest alcohol sales to the largest football crowd in the country at a stadium that doesn't serve beer (and the nearest bar a mile away).\n\nWhat is the ask?\nThe benefits to the community are beyond measure but the cost is easy to quantify ‚Äî roughly the equivalent of two freshly minted Nouns. Let's check the math: the average price of a new Noun over the past 30 days is just under 110 ETH. Assuming/hoping ETH doesn't fall below $1050 before we can successfully float this proposal, two Nouns would total $220,500 ‚Äî just under the minimum needed to keep the event in public hands (see cost breakdown below).\n\nAt the YTD average mint price (a conservative 80 ETH per Noun) the DAO treasury will increase by almost 6,000 ETH before the event series starts in September. We respectfully request 225.15 ETH, a little over twice the daily mint price, to preserve the community charity event.\n\nWhy are we asking Nouns for help?\nIt's been asked, \"why should Nouns sponsor this particular event?\" There is no inherent link between Nouns and a college football beer garden but there are extraordinary benefits for both parties. A year after meeting @4156, his tweet on Feb. 17 was a welcome invitation to engage an open-minded and responsive community. ‚ÄúShill us your crazy ideas,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwe will fund them!‚Äù If I couldn't send a Nouns to space but I could make Nouns visible FROM space. The Nounish ethos of bootstrapped identity and community is embodied in what we've achieved and hope to continue.\n\n\n\nWhere will the money go?\nBefore the current bearish dip, 225 ETH would have been enough to ensure a long and healthy future for the beer garden. It's still enough to fund the bare-bones improvements to benefit Nouns and the event series. If funded, we'd convert crypto to fiat immediately to cover the synthetic turf installation. The Nouns flags and banners described above would be out-of-pocket-expenses. The list below includes improvements that will follow as additional funding allows (calculated at $1050/ETH).\n\n224 ETH: Synthetic turf installation INCLUDING 60-FOOT NOUNS GLASSES ‚Äî we've been quoted a 1.5-inch finished pile that uses an environmentally friendly backing and infill with realistic color and exceptional durability and drainage. Turf materials, excavation and installation run $14/sqft for 11,000 feet of coverage. Ultrabase underlayment panels ($6/sqft) will go in between the compacted gravel base and the turf/infill to handle large vehicle traffic (food trucks, beer trailers, buses, dumpster service, portajohn maintenance). Infill and perimeter board add $15,000 to bring the total cost to $235,000.\n\n0.4 ETH: Nouns Glasses Billboard/Banner ‚Äî One 6x12' heavy-duty vinyl outdoor banner with grommets and heat-welded hems\n\n0.75 ETH Nouns Pole Banners ‚Äî Four double-sided 2x5' pole banners and hangers, to install in pairs on two utility poles on site\n\nIs that the end of it? What comes next?\nTwo Nouns (225 ETH) allows the charity event to last another year, allowing time to negotiate future sponsorship. If this proposal succeeds and Nouns feedback is positive, we may draft a follow-up proposal to name Nouns as the lead sponsor of the event. It wouldn't take much to get there...maybe the equivalent of a third Noun:\n\n72 ETH: Fifty 10-foot Polysteel Picnic Tables ‚Äî community seating for up to 500 people at once (excl. shipping or assembly)\n\n25 ETH: One 40x100' frame tent with water ballast tanks ‚Äî it's less expensive to purchase than to rent for the eight events in a single charity season (excl. dis/assembly & storage cost)\n\nAbout me, the location, and the charity:\nI spent more than two decades as a professional photographer, winning two Emmy Awards and a pair of national POY honors before moving into software where I helped commercial and educational clients manage and monetize digital assets. I started my own business but continue to pursue this labor of love. I avoid the spotlight so there are more mentions of the charity organization than of me in Google search results. I bought the property in 2007 and hosted the community event free of charge until I was unable to sustain my out-of-pocket support and gave up control to an LLC. I remain a member so I have the opportunity to seek sponsorship for the charity event before the LLC turns the property over to private interests.\n\nWhy wait so long to say WHERE this event takes place? Because sports fans have passionate feelings about which teams they do and don't support. The largest stadium in the country, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is home to a team that engenders strong feelings, for and against. I didn't want non-fans to react to the team before understanding the benefits.\n\nThe cause that we support is the local chapter of the national 501( c)(3) non-profit Cancer Support Community. One hundred per cent of beer sales go to the CSC to support education; counseling; financial assistance; healthy living (exercise, stress management, nutrition) programming; social activities for adults, teens and children; and other CSC fundraising events. The CSC is supportive of my Nouns outreach and the Director addressed a letter of support to any potential sponsors.\n\n\n\nProposed Transactions\n0x3765d1527DC0E18AA6e1845597395B430315D94B.transfer(\n‚ÄÉ225.15 ETH\n)\nProposer\n0xcC2688350d29623E2A0844Cc8885F9050F0f6Ed5 at 0x412e5",

      "content": "# Sailing PR campaign, Korea Blockchain Week 2022 [6,7 August]\n\n### tl;dr\nDisplay Nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of Seoul during Korea Blockchain Week 2022.\n\n### Summary\n\n- Sail 40 km on five J/24 sailboats with huge Nouns themed sails.\n- Location: Hangang river, Seoul, South Korea (population 15 million)\n- The river is surrounded with two 20+ km highway roads, cycling roads, parks, and high-rise buildings. There are 13 bridges for cars, subways, trains, and pedestrians.\n- The goal of the project is to promote NounsDAO during Korea Blockchain Week via online and offline engagement. We hope to put content on twitter and instagram during Korea Blockchain Week.\n\n### Date & Time: August 6-7th, 8:00 ~ 18:00\n### Location: Hangang river, Seoul, South Korea\n- August 6th: Kimpo Airport‚ÜíGangnam\n- August 7th: Gangnam‚ÜíKimpo Airport\n\n###  Description\n![https://media.giphy.com/media/XAc2QIWy9ha0ihzFjO/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/XAc2QIWy9ha0ihzFjO/giphy.gif)\n\n- J/24 sailboat is the most famous sailboat model of all time! I propose to display nouns glasses on 5 sailboats in the middle of Seoul, South Korea. Seoul is home to 15+ million people and a lot of interest towards blockchain and NFTs among the population. The Korean government, businesses, and people are interested in blockchain and the NFT space. Hangang river is surrounded by two highways and will be a perfect place to reach lots of people during rush hours. The two way distance will be around 40+ kilometers. This could be a great opportunity to advertise NounsDAO and attract potential future members and developers.\n- I know lots of sailors who want to participate in the Nouns Seoul PR campaign. I will create a fleet of five J/24 sailboats and sail along the river from Kimpo international airport to Itaewon bridge and back. This event is going to be organized for NounsDAO. There will be only 5 sailboats with spinnakers with Nouns Glasses logos.\n- The idea is to make as many people remember Nouns-glasses. I identify two types of impressions offline and online. Images of Nouns glasses on 5 sailboat in the middle of the river will spark curiosity in the minds of the bypassers. This campaign is not a spam like poster or post that many of us learned to ignore without noticing. People would remember Nouns glasses and later when they attend a conference or buy NFTs they would recognize the Nouns symbol and would eventually come straight to the NounsDAO!\n- The spinnakers are big and span an area of 8 meters in height and 4 meters in width. They definitely can be used as decoration at different events. I think the best use for sails is to give them to the teams. There are about five good regattas every year in Korea, I will provide more content free of charge when we race at different events. I am sure a pretty spinnakers with Nouns Glasses would be appreciated by the teams and used for many years.\n\n### Map\n\n![https://media.giphy.com/media/PS8lP8bBk0ICeuIYJE/giphy.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/PS8lP8bBk0ICeuIYJE/giphy.gif)\n\n### Spinnaker sail designs\nI have connections to Hyde sails dealership and can place an expedited order for 5 spinnaker sails with printed logo of the nouns glasses.

Pay NFT Rio a sponsorship quota as a way of thanking the event for welcoming Nouns. (Nouns in Rio was their pinned tweet for over 1 week).\nThe quota will also add:\n+ Nouns on their website**\n+ Mention in NFT.Rio‚Äôs social media.\n+ 20 minutes of Nouns 101 talk in the sponsors' room (by [Leo Clark](https://twitter.com/leoclark)).\n+ Noggles image to be displayed in the institutional video (during the intervals between talks).\n+ Tickets for parties (Full PDF with details available).\n\n** As a sign of good faith Nouns have already been added to their website.\nhttp://nftrio.io/\n\n\n[![website.png](https://i.postimg.cc/qq9D3nFC/website.png)](https://postimg.cc/bS9RXGpz)\n\n2. Photo and video crews dedicated to Nouns to document the event plus the digital billboards in Rio and S√£o Paulo.\n+ All the footage and photos are to be sent to the Marketing Studio cc0 stock.\n\n3. Portuguese translation of Nouns.wtf (Done by [Fabio Seva](https://twitter.com/fabioseva)).\n\n4. 1,000 A2 posters around Rio de Janeiro.\n+ Like in the Hong Kong and Basel example, posters with QR code are to be spread throughout the city during the event.\n\n5. Art contest on [NounsDAO Brazil](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOBrazil) | [NounsDAO Brasil](https://twitter.com/NounsDaoBrasil).\n+ During the event, we will be reaching out to the Brazilian community and promoting a #nounish art contest with a 2 ETH prize split between 5 winners.\n\nWe will engage with the NFT community, host Twitter spaces and get them excited to work on Nouns-related art.\n\n‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\n# The 11 selected Nouns on the link below:\n[Nouns in Rio - NFTs selection](https://docs.google.com/document/d/194Zf1zMpitWJnV2Y7a3pTyW2_PxMV1fGGKFlYI7Yuho/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# WHY?\n\nWe already have great exposure as part of the exhibition alongside some of the great names in the space**. For a reasonable amount, we can thank them (and get the added bonus of being a part of the sponsors) and gain valuable media, footage/photos, as well as live Noun-pilling the audience and guests.\n\nThis will be a defining event for NFTs in Brazil.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to proliferate Nouns in Rio, also supporting the work being done with [NounsDAO Brazil](https://twitter.com/NounsDAOBrazil) | [NounsDAO Brasil](https://twitter.com/NounsDaoBrasil).\n\nWith the potential to reach millions of people and a very diverse art culture, we believe that Nounify Brazil and NounsDAO Brazil will have a great impact on inspiring and helping local communities, and at the same time bring valuable #nounish builders to Nouns.\n\n** Including artworks from Justin Aversano, XCOPY, WoW and others (see image below)\n\n\n[![Artists.png](https://i.postimg.cc/FHWvYCZf/Artists.png)](https://postimg.cc/68vgS0Fw)\n\n\n# WHEN?\n\nEvent dates:\n# 30 June until 3 July\n\nThe organizers agreed to add us as sponsors even before the proposal is approved.

      "content": "# MOO√òNBEANS: Nouns Baked Beans\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nMOO√òNBEANS is a project that produces and sells premium OpenSauce baked beans, and proliferates Nouns by getting them into grocery stores. This is a world first: a community-owned baked bean brand, and a true collaboration between Nouns and Sublime Butter (that‚Äôs us). To deliver on this vision, we‚Äôre asking for $150,000 (c.135 Ether).\n\n---\n\n**Who we are**\n\nWe‚Äôre Sublime Butter Ltd. We‚Äôre a UK-based butter company with a huge array of awards under our belt. We have excellent in-roads with distributors, a proven track record of amazing product development, and a profound understanding of brand.\n\n[![https://i.ibb.co/949CgRH/Awards.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/949CgRH/Awards.jpg)](https://sublimebutter.com/)\n\nBut that‚Äôs not all. We have in our midst a team of powerful developers, designers, storytellers, marketers and strategists who are at the absolute top of their game. Between us we have won two Emmy awards, three Webby awards, and had two BAFTA nominations.\n\n---\n\n**What are the opportunities?**\n\n1) There are a variety of legal, regulatory and licensing must-haves required to be an FMCG brand. It also takes a lot of skill, knowledge and experience to develop, produce and distribute a successful FMCG product. This makes it a tough market for a DAO to break into. UNLESS you have us as a partner. \n\n2) The baked bean industry in the UK is ENORMOUS. Brits get through two million tins of them every single day. And yet, it is one of the plainest and most uninventive verticals on a supermarket shelf. We think this makes it ripe for disruption.\n\n---\n\n**Introducing MOO√òNBEANS**\n\nNouns-branded baked beans, developed according to Sublime‚Äôs incredible recipe. Each 400g tin will be sold for c. ¬£2.50.\n\nWe really want to stress that this is a true collaboration, a first-of-type web3/CC0/real-world merger. Nobody has ever done anything like this before, because such a relationship has never been fostered before. It‚Äôs truly symbiotic, totally unprecedented, and paints an extremely exciting picture for the future.\n\nEach tin will feature a Nouns character that is also represented in our marketing and on-site. We‚Äôre thinking four tin variants should be a good place to start for launch.\n\nNouns DAO will get **20% of all profits** from MOO√òNBEANS sales. \n\nMoreover, getting this right (which we know we will) opens up a huge range of other opportunities in the FMCG space, and therefore a huge range of prospective revenue streams into the Nouns ecosystem. \n\n![https://i.ibb.co/mHg8fJr/Can-V2.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/mHg8fJr/Can-V2.jpg)\n\n*Here‚Äôs a mock-up of some tins. Note: This is **super early,** and designed for illustrative purposes only. The actual branding, tins, website, etc. ‚Äî all of which are a part of the scope of work ‚Äî will be truly, abundantly Nounish.*\n\n---\n\n**Why we‚Äôre doing this**\n\n- We believe in web3/CC0\n- We love Nouns and everything it represents; we want to raise awareness of Nouns in an area that‚Äôs usually difficult to break into\n- We want to position Sublime as a pioneering FMCG brand in the web3 space\n- We believe there are a range of collaboration opportunities here, and this is an excellent test case for future disruption together\n- We want to build a solid foundation for the wider MOO√òNBEANS ecosystem\n\n**Budget**\n\nWe are asking for $150k USD to take MOO√òNBEANS to market (c.135 $ETH at the time of writing). Proposal costings within the model have been denominated in fiat because of the nature of FMCG engagements and their payments.\n\nBudget Breakdown\n\n- Brand & Product Development ‚Äì $25k USD\n- Website & eCom ‚Äì $25k USD\n- Initial MOO√òNBEAN Production ‚Äì $35k USD\n- Initial Marketing ‚Äì $65k USD\n- **Total: $150k**\n\nProfits from MOO√òNBEANS will be consolidated in ETH and proportionally distributed back to a Nouns wallet address of your choosing on a monthly basis from month seven post launch.\n\nA full model for the proposal is available as a spreadsheet on request.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\nIn terms of our approach to delivering this project, we wanted to stress that we‚Äôll be operating with full transparency. MOO√òNBEANS will function as a distinct profit centre, and all accounts will be made public for the Nouns community to view. \n\nIn terms of specifics, we‚Äôll be delivering the following:\n\n- Brand development for MOO√òNBEANS\n- Content strategy\n- Product development\n- Distribution strategy (UK first, then US by next year)\n- Basic website development\n- Integrated eCom functionality built into both [mooonbeans.com](https://mooonbeans.com) and [sublimebutter.com](http://sublimebutter.com) enabling the purchase of MOO√òNBEANS\n- Marketing plan with a heavy focus on mainstream consumer press\n\n**Benefits to Nouns**\n\n- Access to CPG/FMCG\n- Real world revenues; first of its kind\n- Major marketing and PR exposure\n- Exciting new way to get people into crypto\n- Future potential (e.g. other verticals)\n\n**Timings**\n\n---\n\n![https://i.ibb.co/HFYQt37/Whats-App-Image-2022-06-10-at-11-57-31-AM.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/HFYQt37/Whats-App-Image-2022-06-10-at-11-57-31-AM.jpg)\n\n\n**Future Phases**\n\nIf you‚Äôve seen V1 of this proposal, you‚Äôll know that we have a big vision for MOO√òNBEANS. One that extends beyond physical products. Once we have successfully delivered on this core proposition, we have a huge range of ideas that will deepen and enhance it ‚Äî¬†with a view to stimulating mass consumer adoption, further proliferating Nouns and its derivatives, and creating other FMCG goods that will expand the Nouns x Sublime brand universe. Ideas like:\n\n- Educational content that guides novices through their first crypto transactions/interactions\n- Games, stories, and easter eggs that spotlight Nouns and other communities\n\n**Transaction Details**\n\ntx1: 135E to sublime.eth (proposal funding)\n\ntx2: 0.69E to apenoun.eth (coordination & prop building)\n\nN.b. The plan will be to convert all the ETH to USDC/stablecoin assuming proposal passes\n\n**Project updates**\n\nFortnightly Twitter Spaces\n\nFortnightly Medium progress update posts\n\nDiscord community updates\n\n---\n\n**Closing**\n\nThanks so much for reading and considering our proposal, Nouners. We‚Äôre always around to answer questions or even just to chat, so we look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nTeam MOO√òNBEANS",

That would leave our treasury at $6.5M. \n\nI'm not saying that ETH is going that low, but it's not out of the question in crypto.\n\nTo add, we can always buy the ETH back. We have so much ETH, would it hurt to hedge against the chance of an additional 80% drop?\n\nDo the prudent thing. Protect our treasury. Convert 10% of the treasury to USDT.\n\nI'm not adding a transaction because there are a lot of ways to skin this cat and it may best be done with a TWAP.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU9Daiu5XoM\n\n~ Honk diddly.",

      "content": "# Nouns Bidder POAP V2\n\n## tl;dr\n**Nounders, Nouners, and Nounish friends. ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®**\nAfter an exciting V1 Bidder POAP experiment, the team is back with a proposal for a stronger, more robust, and more engaging Bidder POAP experience. With the top-tier UX talent from 0xDesigner, the unmatched creative prowess of SerNoadz, the development expertise of Plaid Shaman, and Brkfstsndwh (along with a direct line to Patricio and the POAP team), we aim to deliver a creative and engaging experience that will continue the spin wheel and proliferation of the meme to a whole new audience.\n\n## Why\nThrough our V1 experiment, our team believes that having an ongoing incentive around bidding in the daily auction is not only beneficial to the DAO (promoting increased bidding on daily auctions to add capital to the treasury), but also allows more people to feel like they are a part of the DAO without actually winning the Noun on auction. POAP and team also have some fun ideas for incentives that will be coming via a secondary proposal (think, raffling off a Noun to POAP winners).\n\n## What\n- Revamped Gallery Page + Auction House and POAP Integrations\n- More Advanced Claiming Mechanism\n- Updated POAP Art with New Artists\n- Retroactive POAPs for Winners Since V1 Ended\n- 6 Months of POAPs and Management from Launch Date\n\n## How\n### Revamped Gallery Page + Integrations\n- We will work with our team of designers and developers to create a revamped gallery page for showcasing the daily POAP, past POAPs, and winning bidders.\n- This page will also show the live auction data for each daily auction, showcasing which bidders are currently in the running to receive one of the daily POAPs.\n- Beyond that, we will integrate the POAP API more seamlessly to make the entire experience of the POAP page more engaging and informative.\n\n### More Advanced Claiming Mechanism\n- With our direct connection to the POAP team, we will work on building a more robust claiming mechanism than the direct send we conducted in V1.\n\n### Updated POAP Art with New Artists\n- Working with the incredibly talented SerNoadz, we will create a unique and updated art style for the Bidder POAPs.\n- We will also aim to commission featured artists monthly that are voted on by the DAO to create unique POAP art in their own nounish style.\n- Below is just an example of some of SerNoadz‚Äôs work, and is by no means the final art style. We will work with the community to land on the final and approved art style for the key POAP art.\n- See example art and full prop [here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-bidder-poap-v2/1440).\n\n### Retroactive POAPs for Winners Since V1 Ended\n- Once the art is complete, we will retroactively send all POAPs to their rightful winners since V1 concluded in May at Noun 296.\n\n## Who\nProducer + Project Manager | Brkfstsndwch\n**Experience:** With close to a decade of production and product management experience, Brkfstsndwch has managed projects ranging from rebrands for some of tech‚Äôs biggest companies to 360 campaigns to website + app builds to feature-length documentaries and so many things in between. Brkfst was also responsible for the proposal and execution of the Bidder POAP V1 project, Nouns Coffee, and has been a part of the Nouns Community since the beginning.\n\nLead Artist | SerNoadz\n**Experience:** An artist that needs no introduction, SerNoadz has been a staple in the Nouns community nearly since its inception, proliferating Nouns day in and day out with their project Noadz, among a plethora of other crucial pieces that have helped the DAO become what it is today. Most recently the current Nouncil site.\n\nUX Designer | 0xDesigner\n**Experience:** Being the lead designer on the POAP V1 project, 0xDesigner has a proven track record at executing to the highest degree. Beyond their involvement in the DAO, 0x is a product designer with a decade of experience working with companies ranging from seed stage startups to big tech like Facebook and Google. 0x has designed and helped launch over 50 digital products via founding a globally ranked UX agency.\n\nDeveloper | Plaid Shaman\n**Experience:** For nearly 20 years, Plaid Shaman (Brian) has been working with startups, agencies, and non-profits bringing 100s of projects to life. More recently, they‚Äôve been collaborating on Web3 projects to create innovative experiences with NFTs and other blockchain technology. A few most recent projects have included, NounCats, Contract Reader, Chowies, and more.\n\nCommissioned Artists | To Be Voted On by Community\n\n### Timeline\n**6-10 Weeks | Overall Timeline**\n- 4-6 Weeks | Revamped Gallery Page + Integrations\n- 4-6 Weeks | POAP Art Development\n- 2-4 Weeks | Claiming Mechanism Development\n- 1 Week | Retroactive POAP Shipment\n\n### Budget\n32.5 ETH | Revamped Gallery Page, Auction House + POAP Integration\n- 12.5 ETH | UX Design\n- 15 ETH | Development\n- 5 ETH | Project Management\n\n40 ETH | Updated POAP Art\n- 20 ETH | Key Art Development\n- 5 ETH | Art for Retroactive POAPs\n- 10 ETH | Commission Budget for POAP Artists\n- 5 ETH | Artist + Project Management\n\n5 ETH | Updated Claiming Mechanism Development\n6 ETH | 6 Month Management of POAP Sends\n2 ETH | Retroactive POAP Sends\n2.5 ETH | General Project Management and Community Project Lead\n\n**Total Funds Requested | 88 ETH**",

      "content": "# Nouns cc0 Space Image Bank\n\n# TLDR:\n\nSpace is one of the core themes in cryptoart and the NFT universe. This proposal is to ask Nouns to fund a repository of cc0 space images for all artists to use freely in their work. Sponsored by the Nouns DAO, the website will feature nounish elements as well as an \"about section\" with information about Nouns. The Nouns ecosystem will be proliferated through exposure to the artistic community as well as any potential exposure from the featuring of the space images on mainstream and specialized media. Total amount requested: 12 Eth.\n\n# About me:\nIf you prefer to watch instead of reading, check out this short video I made for my SuperRare application to learn more about myself and my work. \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1iffK8n9uYuJgV8BmHjQaYXPuhgGmvHxi/view?usp=sharing\n\nMy passion for space and astronomy started at a very early age and I started shooting astrophotography about 7 years ago when I first paired a camera to the eyepiece of my telescope. After doing this as a hobby for several years, two years ago I decided to quit my job in TV and film production to become a full time astrophotographer. In early 2021 I minted my first NFT and throughout this past year I've released two collections and over 20 1/1 NFTs. During this past year, my work has been featured across several media outlets such as NASA‚Äôs Astronomy Picture of the Day and the European Space Agency's social media profiles, as well as a number of astronomy websites and magazines, and I've even had the honor of having one of my pictures used as a stamp of the Argentine Postal Service.\n\n\n\n# Goal:\n\nAs a way to give visibility to the Nouns DAO, a cc0 image bank of space images will be set up that will serve as a repository for artists working on space-themed art. Space is a huge theme in cryptoart and NFTs. These images will be free to be used as subjects, backdrops and to be repurposed as artists see fit without the need to attribute authorship, giving artists complete control. The url **cc0images.wtf** has already been secured to this end.\n\n**Nouns proliferation:**\n\nThe website would be designed in line with the Nouniverse aesthetics and would contain an \"about'' section with information about Nouns.

Tens of hours of exposures as well as extensive processing time are needed in order to capture these objects, and most objects only appear in the night sky during limited periods of time during the year so the collection would be slowly built throughout an entire year. Some of the images will be shot from my rooftop observatory but others require traveling to dark sky sites. The images will be a balanced mix of deep space objects shot on telescopes, solar system bodies (Sun, Moon and planets), widefield images (star fields, milky way shots, star trail images) and landscape astrophotography, to offer a wider variety of objects and backdrops for artists.\n\nLaunch of the website would be scheduled six months after proposal is approved with an initial amount of 15 images at launch, and another 15 images would be added after a second six month period (this second update could be scheduled at shorter, more frequent intervals with a smaller amount of images).\n\n# Budget\n\nProject management and execution, consisting of planning and acquiring the images throughout a one year period - 5 Eth\n\nEquipment upgrades (purchases to upgrade equipment already owned) - 3 eth\n\nExpenses for dark sky sites travel - 2 eth\n\nWebsite development and maintenance (according to scope of this proposal) - 2 eth\n\nTotal: 12 Eth\n\n**Thank you for reading!

      "content": "# Nouns cc0 Space Image Bank\n\n# TLDR:\n\nSpace is one of the core themes in cryptoart and the NFT universe. This proposal is to ask Nouns to fund a repository of cc0 space images for all artists to use freely in their work. Sponsored by the Nouns DAO, the website will feature nounish elements as well as an \"about section\" with information about Nouns. The Nouns ecosystem will be proliferated through exposure to the artistic community as well as any potential exposure from the featuring of the space images on mainstream and specialized media. Total amount requested: 12 Eth.\n\n# About me:\nIf you prefer to watch instead of reading, check out this short video I made for my SuperRare application to learn more about myself and my work. \n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1iffK8n9uYuJgV8BmHjQaYXPuhgGmvHxi/view?usp=sharing\n\nMy passion for space and astronomy started at a very early age and I started shooting astrophotography about 7 years ago when I first paired a camera to the eyepiece of my telescope. After doing this as a hobby for several years, two years ago I decided to quit my job in TV and film production to become a full time astrophotographer. In early 2021 I minted my first NFT and throughout this past year I've released two collections and over 20 1/1 NFTs. During this past year, my work has been featured across several media outlets such as NASA‚Äôs Astronomy Picture of the Day and the European Space Agency's social media profiles, as well as a number of astronomy websites and magazines, and I've even had the honor of having one of my pictures used as a stamp of the Argentine Postal Service.\n\n\n\n# Goal:\n\nAs a way to give visibility to the Nouns DAO, a cc0 image bank of space images will be set up that will serve as a repository for artists working on space-themed art. Space is a huge theme in cryptoart and NFTs. These images will be free to be used as subjects, backdrops and to be repurposed as artists see fit without the need to attribute authorship, giving artists complete control. The url **cc0images.wtf** has already been secured to this end.\n\n**Nouns proliferation:**\n\nThe website would be designed in line with the Nouniverse aesthetics and would contain an \"about'' section with information about Nouns. Besides strengthening ties and gaining visibility within the artist community, space images are regularly featured on specialized and mainstream media, which could potentially increase visibility to the Nouns community outside the art/NFT circles, by being featured by space agencies and more traditional media outlets reaching the general public. When published in  media, images would be credited to the photographer and the Nouns DAO.\n\n**Website Mockup:**\n\n![690x460]( https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e2982b_b37b352373d746f89df20b099d550a89~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_750,h_421,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/mockup%20portada%20copy.jpg)\n\n![690x460]( https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e2982b_27fa02424e8f4ef095329ff2748b6f8d~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_750,h_421,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/mockup%20about%20copy.jpg)\n\n# About the images:\n\nAs technology has pushed forward during the past years, the ability to image deep space objects like distant galaxies or nebulae has stopped being the exclusive realm of observatories and space telescopes, and amateur astronomers worldwide now have access to hardware that allows them to photograph these stunning objects.

Tens of hours of exposures as well as extensive processing time are needed in order to capture these objects, and most objects only appear in the night sky during limited periods of time during the year so the collection would be slowly built throughout an entire year. Some of the images will be shot from my rooftop observatory but others require traveling to dark sky sites. The images will be a balanced mix of deep space objects shot on telescopes, solar system bodies (Sun, Moon and planets), widefield images (star fields, milky way shots, star trail images) and landscape astrophotography, to offer a wider variety of objects and backdrops for artists.\n\nLaunch of the website would be scheduled six months after proposal is approved with an initial amount of 15 images at launch, and another 15 images would be added after a second six month period (this second update could be scheduled at shorter, more frequent intervals with a smaller amount of images).\n\n# Budget\n\nProject management and execution, consisting of planning and acquiring the images throughout a one year period - 5 Eth\n\nEquipment upgrades (purchases to upgrade equipment already owned) - 3 eth\n\nExpenses for dark sky sites travel - 2 eth\n\nWebsite development and maintenance (according to scope of this proposal) - 2 eth\n\nTotal: 12 Eth\n\n**Thank you for reading!

      "content": "# Nouns Bidder POAP V2\n\n## tl;dr\n**Nounders, Nouners, and Nounish friends. ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®**\nAfter an exciting V1 Bidder POAP experiment, the team is back with a proposal for a stronger, more robust, and more engaging Bidder POAP experience. With the top-tier UX talent from 0xDesigner, the unmatched creative prowess of SerNoadz, the development expertise of Plaid Shaman, and Brkfstsndwh (along with a direct line to Patricio and the POAP team), we aim to deliver a creative and engaging experience that will continue the spin wheel and proliferation of the meme to a whole new audience.\n\n## Why\nThrough our V1 experiment, our team believes that having an ongoing incentive around bidding in the daily auction is not only beneficial to the DAO (promoting increased bidding on daily auctions to add capital to the treasury), but also allows more people to feel like they are a part of the DAO without actually winning the Noun on auction. POAP and team also have some fun ideas for incentives that will be coming via a secondary proposal (think, raffling off a Noun to POAP winners).\n\n## What\n- Revamped Gallery Page + Auction House and POAP Integrations\n- More Advanced Claiming Mechanism\n- Updated POAP Art with New Artists\n- Retroactive POAPs for Winners Since V1 Ended\n- 6 Months of POAPs and Management from Launch Date\n\n## How\n### Revamped Gallery Page + Integrations\n- We will work with our team of designers and developers to create a revamped gallery page for showcasing the daily POAP, past POAPs, and winning bidders.\n- This page will also show the live auction data for each daily auction, showcasing which bidders are currently in the running to receive one of the daily POAPs.\n- Beyond that, we will integrate the POAP API more seamlessly to make the entire experience of the POAP page more engaging and informative.\n\n### More Advanced Claiming Mechanism\n- With our direct connection to the POAP team, we will work on building a more robust claiming mechanism than the direct send we conducted in V1.\n\n### Updated POAP Art with New Artists\n- Working with the incredibly talented SerNoadz, we will create a unique and updated art style for the Bidder POAPs.\n- We will also aim to commission featured artists monthly that are voted on by the DAO to create unique POAP art in their own nounish style.\n- Below is just an example of some of SerNoadz‚Äôs work, and is by no means the final art style. We will work with the community to land on the final and approved art style for the key POAP art.\n- See example art and full prop [here](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-bidder-poap-v2/1440).\n\n### Retroactive POAPs for Winners Since V1 Ended\n- Once the art is complete, we will retroactively send all POAPs to their rightful winners since V1 concluded in May at Noun 296.\n\n## Who\nProducer + Project Manager | Brkfstsndwch\n**Experience:** With close to a decade of production and product management experience, Brkfstsndwch has managed projects ranging from rebrands for some of tech‚Äôs biggest companies to 360 campaigns to website + app builds to feature-length documentaries and so many things in between. Brkfst was also responsible for the proposal and execution of the Bidder POAP V1 project, Nouns Coffee, and has been a part of the Nouns Community since the beginning.\n\nLead Artist | SerNoadz\n**Experience:** An artist that needs no introduction, SerNoadz has been a staple in the Nouns community nearly since its inception, proliferating Nouns day in and day out with their project Noadz, among a plethora of other crucial pieces that have helped the DAO become what it is today. Most recently the current Nouncil site.\n\nUX Designer | 0xDesigner\n**Experience:** Being the lead designer on the POAP V1 project, 0xDesigner has a proven track record at executing to the highest degree. Beyond their involvement in the DAO, 0x is a product designer with a decade of experience working with companies ranging from seed stage startups to big tech like Facebook and Google. 0x has designed and helped launch over 50 digital products via founding a globally ranked UX agency.\n\nDeveloper | Plaid Shaman\n**Experience:** For nearly 20 years, Plaid Shaman (Brian) has been working with startups, agencies, and non-profits bringing 100s of projects to life. More recently, they‚Äôve been collaborating on Web3 projects to create innovative experiences with NFTs and other blockchain technology. A few most recent projects have included, NounCats, Contract Reader, Chowies, and more.\n\nCommissioned Artists | To Be Voted On by Community\n\n### Timeline\n**6-10 Weeks | Overall Timeline**\n- 4-6 Weeks | Revamped Gallery Page + Integrations\n- 4-6 Weeks | POAP Art Development\n- 2-4 Weeks | Claiming Mechanism Development\n- 1 Week | Retroactive POAP Shipment\n\n### Budget\n32.5 ETH | Revamped Gallery Page, Auction House + POAP Integration\n- 12.5 ETH | UX Design\n- 15 ETH | Development\n- 5 ETH | Project Management\n\n40 ETH | Updated POAP Art\n- 20 ETH | Key Art Development\n- 5 ETH | Art for Retroactive POAPs\n- 10 ETH | Commission Budget for POAP Artists\n- 5 ETH | Artist + Project Management\n\n5 ETH | Updated Claiming Mechanism Development\n6 ETH | 6 Month Management of POAP Sends\n2 ETH | Retroactive POAP Sends\n2.5 ETH | General Project Management and Community Project Lead\n\n**Total Funds Requested | 88 ETH**",

Both have already compulsively created all manner of high quality nounish, memish content, which has garnered hundreds of thousands of impressions, and been shared countless (no, literally, we don‚Äôt know how to do this) times on twitter and discord by the wider community to express their nounishness and spread the meme.\n\nYou can see gifs already by GOAT CLUB here: [https://tenor.com/users/goldypix\n](https://tenor.com/users/goldypix)\nAnd more nounish content below:\n\n**![|588x832](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mc7wudpn0zraryj/goatclubnounishness_march2022.jpeg?dl=1)**\n\n**CONTENT**\nOur vision is to focus mostly on the content we know works; we want more of it. But we also want to be flexible, and move wherever both excites us and is getting traction. Part of the process will involve some experimentation to try to find new avenues for impact, ideally we unlock new nounish ideas. We will deliver within 1-3 months.\n\n**We will mainly focus on:**  \n* Nounish remixes of reaction gifs\n\n**With a secondary focus on:**\n* Nounified static memes, cartoon/comics, and pop culture remixes\n* Nounish artwork (pixel art and otherwise) with cultural references and memetic resonance.\n\n**And we may experiment with:**\n* Brand new nounish memes (as opposed to remixing existing memes)\n* Lo-fi nounish videos\n* ‚Ä¶Perhaps something not yet considered\n\n**Community requests:**\n* We will create a twitter hashtag, and a channel on the nouns discord for the project (or perhaps our own discord if its neccesary) for community members to request remixes, content or share ideas.\n\n**Bonus**\n* Livestream the creation of 1-2 gifs\n* Timelapse of a creation of 1-2 gifs\n\n![|444x235](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/SNtkogr9Bq5pFxATI3itMf_YblttSCdyqCWNdQJAj-Jox9AbWsYxYLQP8H8JaSM5_Hcy0nDcItBaAuDJiJbsSLB18rTWLnf8PPyzc3tO4NwG6zxpkTI1zxlwQzNwOVAlx-GbAw69)\n\n\n**ACCESS & PROLIFERATION**\nWe‚Äôll upload everything we make to accessible repositories for easy use, especially those with native integrations to social platforms like Tenor and Giphy, as well as a repository of all the things we have made and will continue to make (Google Drive or Dropbox etc.)\n\nWe‚Äôll convert the most appropriately scaled work as Discord reactions (emotes) for extra ease of use. (Happy to either host these on a Goat Club discord server or give to Nouns DAO server admins).\n\nWe will also make dedicated efforts to share this content, as natively as possible (as well as find ways to encourage others) via twitter and discord to increase awareness of the existence of all of them. Connecting the gifs with a hashtag like #nouns or #nounify could be quite powerful.\n\n![nounish-more|500x500](https://c.tenor.com/lCq21Mx-m0UAAAAC/nouns-nounsdao.gif)\n\n**RISKS & REWARD**\n**Worst case scenario:** \nThere‚Äôs a whole bunch of new Nounish content to enjoy, share, and proliferate.\n\n**Best case scenario:** \nWe strike gold memetic gold and some content we create spreads far and wide on the internet, beyond our nounish bubble.\n\nWe‚Äôre big fans of Noun 40‚Äôs Retroactive Outsized Rewards idea in general, and we‚Äôd love for the DAO to be open to such a thing if anything we made here became a huge success (eg. millions of views etc).\n\n![nounish-bet-casino 3|500x500](https://c.tenor.com/8IzaluQFhFwAAAAd/nouns-nounish.gif)\n\n\n**THANKS!**\nThank you Nouners and Nounees, we look forward to hearing feedback, ideas and questions.\n\nGoldy üêê & Tummlin üêê\n\n![nounish-thanks-partner-kid-4|380x283](https://c.tenor.com/bNL0vsp36oMAAAAd/nounish-nouns.gif)",

This activation will take place during NFT NYC (June 20 ‚Äì 23) and will feature:\n- Hand painted mural by Jasper Wong who is an artist and founder of Worldwide Walls (http://www.powwowworldwide.com/ 3), the mural will be viewable from June 20 ‚Äì July 10 and will feature Nouns in all their glory.\n- Simple website / landing page to commemorate the mural\n\n**The activation is estimated to generate ~1.7M impressions. The total amount being requested is 72.5 ETH.**\n\n## Why Should You Care? \nWe can all agree that art is a pretty powerful communicator; it appeals to our emotions, forces us to think, and does a pretty good job of bringing us together on some level. We hope to use this power to accomplish the following: \n- Increase awareness of Nouns at NFT NYC‚Äîonline and IRL\n- Increase brand awareness of the Nouns DAO as a leader in the industry;\n- Invite NFT enthusiasts and the public at large to become involved with the Nouns DAO community. We want to let people know that we are here and we invite them to come build the future with us; and,\n- Create a website (nounsirl.live) that tells the story behind the art (plan is to also include art from other cities on the tour)\n  - High-res images and time lapse video of the mural, artist‚Äôs explanation etc.\n  - Links to Nouns website, twitter, discord, etc.  \n\n## Nouns IRL ‚Äî Person, Place, Thing\nNouns: person, place, thing‚Ä¶ We thought that it would be really cool to bring this concept to IRL via fun and engaging art activations around the world. Each stop on the tour will feature a specific artist (or group of artists), a city, and an interesting Nounified art piece. Imagine Nouns on Venice Beach, or Nouns on a rehabilitated basketball court in Chicago. Imagine the looks on people‚Äôs faces if a huge inflated Noun floated by them in Miami. These art activations will vary in flight time from several weeks to several months, with the goal being to create longer lasting pieces that become a part of the cultural backdrop in the city. There are a ton of things we can explore on this tour and we think NFT NYC would be a perfect place to start. \n\n## Person\nJasper Wong, founder of [Worldwide Walls](https://www.instagram.com/powwowworldwide/?hl=en).\n\nJasper Wong is an artist, illustrator, curator and art director; his art style can be described as a unique clash of Asian-influenced pop culture on paper. Jasper has exhibited worldwide in places such as Japan, California, France, London, Mexico, New York, Hong Kong, Chicago, and Australia. Jasper is also extremely accomplished having been chosen as one of the HB100, a list of Hypebeast‚Äôs 100 most influential figures in the industry, which includes the likes of Kaws, Pharrell, Banksy, Jay Z and Kanye West.\n\nJasper is a big fan of Nouns, he has been following the project for some time and is very excited at the opportunity to get involved with the DAO. In addition to painting the mural, Jasper will be sending out Nouns-related messages on his social media platforms to engage his followers before and during the mural‚Äôs flight time. Jasper is also very well known within the art community and will attempt to leverage his network to invite some of his artist friends to hang out with him at the completed mural during NFT NYC. The goal will be to use both Jasper and his artist friends‚Äô followers to generate additional traffic at the mural and further amplify social media impressions.\n\nJasper is very involved with the community through his non-profit organisation Pow! Wow! of which he is the creator and lead director. Pow! Wow! is a group of contemporary artists committed to community enrichment through the creation of art outreach programs, educational programs, and engaging the community in the creation and appreciation of art. Pow! Wow! has executed projects (murals, school renovations, basketball courts, etc.) in 13 cities around the globe, such as Honolulu, Taipei, Tokyo, Nepal, Guam, Seoul, Israel, and others. \n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/Gd2UFLO.jpg)\n_(Jasper Wong)_\n\n## Place\nNew York City during NFT NYC, the Super Bowl of NFT conferences.\n\nNFT NYC is the perfect staging ground for the first Nouns IRL activation. One of the stated missions of the DAO is to attract builders/creatives who are ready to create products that proliferate the Nouns brand to a wider audience and shed positive light on the concept of DAOs. NFT/crypto enthusiasts attending NFT NYC are a perfect target for this mission as many are informed about the space and are also builders/creatives looking for a project to support. The general public present in New York at this time will be surrounded by a ton of NFT related themes which should generate interest and curiosity. Many of these people (who may also be builders/creatives) have not yet fully explored the crypto space, this will be an opportunity to capture their attention and encourage them to become involved with Nouns DAO.\n\n## Thing\nSharable hand painted mural art piece promoting Nouns and a simple website.\n\nWe have encouraged Jasper to create a mural in his style that is a conversational piece. The mural will act as an introduction to the crypto space for many newcomers, we hope that it inspires a sense of curiosity and an urge to dig deeper. For the more experienced, the mural will act as an introduction to Nouns; we hope that it shows them the many possibilities of being involved with the DAO. The overall goal is to create a compelling piece which introduces Nouns to the viewer and inspires the viewer to get involved. \n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/HKKgICa.png)\n\nThe mural will be located at 300 W Broadway (next to the entrance of the Soho Grand Hotel, facing the busy Holland Tunnel) and will measure 8‚Äô9‚Äù H x 16‚Äô W in size.\n\nAs mentioned above, the ultimate goal is to launch a continued effort to promote Nouns worldwide through art. NYC is the first stop of the tour. The Nouns IRL website will act as an artefact for this and all future activations. The website will contain high-res images, time lapse video, artist bio, story behind the art, and links to the discord, the main Nouns website, discourse, etc. \n\n## Budget (all figures are in USD):\n- Mural Wall: $36,000.00:\nWe have been advised by the wall company that a soft hold will be placed on the mural location for us at least until the 10th of June.\n- Artist: $40,000.00\n- Team: $25,000.00\n- Nouns IRL Landing page + capturing of video and photos for social: $11,000.00\n- Travel / Accommodations: $6,000.00\n\n**Total: $118,000.00, total ETH ask: 72.5 ETH**\n_Based on ~$1,700.00 price of ETH as of June 3, 2022; we have added ~3 additional ETH to try and account for volatility and fees._\n\n## Team\nThis activation is being executed by the [Nouns Collective](https://twitter.com/Nounscollectiv3) (formerly the Collective DAO) which is a liquid super team made up of friends building playful, useful, and beautiful products and experiences with the crypto communities they love. We have previously contributed to the community via the [Nouns iOS app](https://www.nounsapp.wtf/) (proposal 6) which was officially launched on May 16, 2022. The Nouns Collective is composed of experienced founders, brand builders, and developers with over 15 years of experience building successful products. \n\nFor this activation we have teamed up with [@miss_singh](https://twitter.com/Miss_Singh) who is a creative professional, cultural connector, community builder, experiential expert, and entrepreneur. @miss_singh has over two decades of experience that spans industries from tech, marketing, fashion and retail with her most recent gig being with Shopify. @miss_singh is extremely excited to jump into the Web3 world with us and looks to use her considerable experience and talents to deliver a memorable and lasting experience.\n\n## To be Nountinued‚Ä¶\n\nWe are super excited to merge Nouns with IRL. The Nouns community is strong and vibrant; we hope to show the world who we are and what we are about. The best way to onboard more individuals, especially builders, into the space is to meet them where they are. DAOs, NFTs, blockchains, this can all be difficult to grasp for newcomers. Using familiar / traditional mediums of delivery (pop-ups, art, events, etc.) to introduce these concepts are an effective way to drive engagement. We hope that this stop on the tour will be the first of many to come!\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/9upXNjf.png)\n_(Uniqlo Mural, Jasper Wong)_",

This activation will take place during NFT NYC (June 20 ‚Äì 23) and will feature:\n- Hand painted mural by Jasper Wong who is an artist and founder of Worldwide Walls (http://www.powwowworldwide.com/ 3), the mural will be viewable from June 20 ‚Äì July 10 and will promote NFT culture by highlighting several well known projects with Nouns at the center.\n- Simple website / landing page to commemorate the mural\n\n**The activation is estimated to generate ~2.5M impressions. The total amount being requested is 87.5 ETH.**\n\n## Why Should You Care? \nWe can all agree that art is a pretty powerful communicator; it appeals to our emotions, forces us to think, and does a pretty good job of bringing us together on some level. We hope to use this power to accomplish the following: \n- Increase awareness of Nouns at NFT NYC‚Äîonline and IRL\n- Increase brand awareness of the Nouns DAO as a leader in the industry;\n- Invite NFT enthusiasts and the public at large to become involved with the Nouns DAO community. We want to let people know that we are here and we invite them to come build the future with us; and,\n- Create a website (nounsirl.live) that tells the story behind the art (plan is to also include art from other cities on the tour)\n  - High-res images and time lapse video of the mural, artist‚Äôs explanation etc.\n  - Links to Nouns website, twitter, discord, etc.  \n\n## Nouns IRL ‚Äî Person, Place, Thing\nNouns: person, place, thing‚Ä¶ We thought that it would be really cool to bring this concept to IRL via fun and engaging art activations around the world. Each stop on the tour will feature a specific artist (or group of artists), a city, and an interesting Nounified art piece. Imagine Nouns on Venice Beach, or Nouns on a rehabilitated basketball court in Chicago. Imagine the looks on people‚Äôs faces if a huge inflated Noun floated by them in Miami. These art activations will vary in flight time from several weeks to several months, with the goal being to create longer lasting pieces that become a part of the cultural backdrop in the city. There are a ton of things we can explore on this tour and we think NFT NYC would be a perfect place to start. \n\n## Person\nJasper Wong, founder of [Worldwide Walls](https://www.instagram.com/powwowworldwide/?hl=en).\n\nJasper Wong is an artist, illustrator, curator and art director; his art style can be described as a unique clash of Asian-influenced pop culture on paper. Jasper has exhibited worldwide in places such as Japan, California, France, London, Mexico, New York, Hong Kong, Chicago, and Australia. Jasper is also extremely accomplished having been chosen as one of the HB100, a list of Hypebeast‚Äôs 100 most influential figures in the industry, which includes the likes of Kaws, Pharrell, Banksy, Jay Z and Kanye West.\n\nJasper is a big fan of Nouns, he has been following the project for some time and is very excited at the opportunity to get involved with the DAO. In addition to painting the mural, Jasper will be sending out Nouns-related messages on his social media platforms to engage his followers before and during the mural‚Äôs flight time. Jasper is also very well known within the art community and will attempt to leverage his network to invite some of his artist friends to hang out with him at the completed mural during NFT NYC. The goal will be to use both Jasper and his artist friends‚Äô followers to generate additional traffic at the mural and further amplify social media impressions.\n\nJasper is very involved with the community through his non-profit organisation Pow! Wow! of which he is the creator and lead director. Pow! Wow! is a group of contemporary artists committed to community enrichment through the creation of art outreach programs, educational programs, and engaging the community in the creation and appreciation of art. Pow! Wow! has executed projects (murals, school renovations, basketball courts, etc.) in 13 cities around the globe, such as Honolulu, Taipei, Tokyo, Nepal, Guam, Seoul, Israel, and others. \n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/Gd2UFLO.jpg)\n_(Jasper Wong)_\n\n## Place\nNew York City during NFT NYC, the Super Bowl of NFT conferences.\n\nNFT NYC is the perfect staging ground for the first Nouns IRL activation. One of the stated missions of the DAO is to attract builders/creatives who are ready to create products that proliferate the Nouns brand to a wider audience and shed positive light on the concept of DAOs. NFT/crypto enthusiasts attending NFT NYC are a perfect target for this mission as many are informed about the space and are also builders/creatives looking for a project to support. The general public present in New York at this time will be surrounded by a ton of NFT related themes which should generate interest and curiosity. Many of these people (who may also be builders/creatives) have not yet fully explored the crypto space, this will be an opportunity to capture their attention and encourage them to become involved with Nouns DAO.\n\n## Thing\nSharable hand painted mural art piece promoting NFT culture (optimised for social sharing on Twitter and Instagram) and website.\n\nWe have encouraged Jasper to create a mural in his style that is a conversational piece. The mural will act as an introduction to the crypto space for many newcomers, we hope that it inspires a sense of curiosity and an urge to dig deeper. For those in the know, the mural will act as a proverbial nod of acknowledgment to the projects that have made an impact and have shed a positive light on the crypto space in general. The mural will showcase popular CC0 and non-CC0 projects such as BAYC, Doodles, Moonbirds, Cryptoads, Chain Runners, CryptoPunks, Coolcats, World of Women, Creature World, DeadFellaz, Okay Bears, etc. Each of these projects have extremely large and very loyal followings which we believe will ensure that the mural reaches the widest audience possible. The goal is to create a compelling piece which shows unity within the crypto space and inspires the viewer to get involved. \n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/HKKgICa.png)\n\nThe mural will be located at 300 W Broadway, next to the entrance of the Soho Grand Hotel, facing the busy Holland Tunnel) and will measure 8‚Äô9‚Äù H x 16‚Äô W in size.\n\nAs mentioned above, the ultimate goal is to launch a continued effort to promote Nouns worldwide through art. NYC is the first stop of the tour. The Nouns IRL website will act as an artefact for this and all future activations. The website will contain high-res images, time lapse video, artist bio, story behind the art, and links to the discord, the main Nouns website, discourse, etc. \n\n## Budget (all figures are in USD):\n- Mural Wall: $62,000.00:\nA soft hold was placed on the mural location until the 27th of May; we are in communication with the mural company about extending the hold for at least another week. If we are able to keep the current location, the cost for the wall will be $36,000.00. The $62,000.00 amount is a rough quote for an alternate location. We are in communication with the wall company to determine if cheaper locations are available. We are more than willing to return any funds that we did not end up needing to use to secure the wall.\n- Artist: $40,000.00\n- Team: $25,000.00\n- Nouns IRL Landing page + capturing of video and photos for social: $11,000.00\n- Travel / Accommodations: $6,000.00\n\n**Total: $144,000.00, total ETH ask: 87.5 ETH**\n_Based on $1,700.00 price of ETH as of May 27, 2022; we have added 2.5 additional ETH to try and account for volatility and fees._\n\n## Team\nThis activation is being executed by the [Nouns Collective](https://twitter.com/Nounscollectiv3) (formerly the Collective DAO) which is a liquid super team made up of friends building playful, useful, and beautiful products and experiences with the crypto communities they love. We have previously contributed to the community via the [Nouns iOS app](https://www.nounsapp.wtf/) (proposal 6) which was officially launched on May 16, 2022. The Nouns Collective is composed of experienced founders, brand builders, and developers with over 15 years of experience building successful products. \n\nFor this activation we have teamed up with [@miss_singh](https://twitter.com/Miss_Singh) who is a creative professional, cultural connector, community builder, experiential expert, and entrepreneur. @miss_singh has over two decades of experience that spans industries from tech, marketing, fashion and retail with her most recent gig being with Shopify. @miss_singh is extremely excited to jump into the Web3 world with us and looks to use her considerable experience and talents to deliver a memorable and lasting experience.\n\n## To be Nountinued‚Ä¶\n\nWe are super excited to merge Nouns with IRL. The Nouns community is strong and vibrant; we hope to show the world who we are and what we are about. The best way to onboard more individuals, especially builders, into the space is to meet them where they are. DAOs, NFTs, blockchains, this can all be difficult to grasp for newcomers. Using familiar / traditional mediums of delivery (pop-ups, art, events, etc.) to introduce these concepts are an effective way to drive engagement. We hope that this stop on the tour will be the first of many to come!\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/9upXNjf.png)\n_(Uniqlo Mural, Jasper Wong)_",

      "content": "# Nouns x Vector DAO: Secret Nouns 1/1s drop at NFT NYC\n\n# Nouns x Vector DAO: Secret Nouns 1/1s drop at NFT NYC\nNouns ‚ÑÖ Vector DAO Proposal \n\n## Summary\nVector DAO will commission 8 artists in our community to design a series of unique Nouns artworks and print them on 200+ extra-large (6ft high!) wheatpaste posters around New York City for NFT NYC. Each unique poster design will be posted in a grid of 8 (all 8 posters will be the same artwork), with different designs being posted in their own grid of 8 across different locations, creating a scavenger like hunt to collect all 8 artworks.\n\nEach poster will have a QR code that will allow individuals to mint 1 of 150 limited editions of each artwork. There will be 1,200 total mints at a price of 0.15 ETH each. All primary and secondary sales will go to the Vector DAO treasury to be used to purchase a Noun, replenishing the Nouns treasury. Any remaining ETH post Nouns acquisition will be split among the artists and team. As a stretch goal, we will try to support having the first 25 mints of each artwork be free, allowing this drop to be accessible to more people ‚Äì this will depend on our ability to find an elegant sybil resistant solution in time.\n\nVector will provide photographers to take photos of all the posters to share on social to boost visibility (blurring out the QR code) as well as write an article about our collaboration experience with Nouns DAO to help future creators make proposals.\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/HB7iq5Y.png)\n\n## What‚Äôs in it for Nouns DAO?\n### Spread the Nouns meme\n- We're putting up 200 giant posters (6ft tall) around NYC during a high visibility week + taking photos to share online\n- The artwork will be done by a roster of top tier artists with their own audience and community\n- There's a fun game attached to being the first to find the posters and mint the limited NFTs, creating a viral loop to share back online\n- Vector DAO will use proceeds from the mint to purchase a Noun, forming a long term relationship between Vector and Nouns, helping replenish the treasury, and cementing the culture of paying it forward to more nounish builders\n\n### Pave a path for more creatives to contribute to Nouns\n- We'll bring 8 really amazing artists into the Nouns universe, who will then talk about it with their friends, driving more high caliber builders to the Nouns universe\n- This also forms a relationship with Vector DAO, a community of 80 super strong makers who are excited to further contribute to nouns\n- We'll write an article about the entire process to help onboard more makers into the community\n\n## The Artists\n[Shawna X](https://shawna-x.com) | New Yorker, Academy Awards, Nike, Google\n[Elijah Anderson](https://www.instagram.com/spacehose/) | Adidas, SNS / New Balance, Popeye‚Äôs\n[Lulu Lin](https://www.instagram.com/da__h_/) | Adobe, MAYDAY Magazine, Migrant Journal \n[Adam Ho](https://www.adamho.com/) | Cash App, Beat Foundry, Airbnb, Nike\n[Danny Jones](https://yasly.com/) | Grammy‚Äôs, Nike, New Balance\n[Haruko Hayakawa](https://www.haruko.co/) | New York Times, Bon Appetit, Fly by Jing\n[Moon Collective](https://www.instagram.com/mooncollective/) | Saturdays NYC, Instagram, Popi CBD\n_And more (pending proposal approval)_\n\n## The concept: Independent, together\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/bYQ8hIH.jpg)\n_(Similar concept for Art Basel in 2021)_\n\nWe‚Äôre commissioning 8 artists with distinct styles to create a series of posters remixing Nouns, showcasing each artist‚Äôs unique styles and perspectives (illustration, 3D, typography, color, etc). To create a consistent visual motif across the posters, the artwork must feature a Nouns artifact, but interpreted however the artist sees fit. Vector will have these artworks printed on 200+ wheatpaste posters and posted around the NFT NYC conference in Times Square and in neighborhoods like Williamsburg and SoHo.\n\nEach poster will have a QR code where viewers can mint 1 of 150 limited edition NFTs of that poster‚Äôs artwork. Each NFT edition will have a mint price of 0.15 ETH and be sold using the [Zora Protocol](https://create.zora.co/).\n\nWe hope the end product not only propagates the Nouns brand and reflects the power of placing goods in the public domain, but also the power of individuals in forming digital communities like Vector to create across both digital and physical mediums.\n\n## About Vector DAO\nVector DAO is a collective of artists, designers, and developers in web3. Our mission is to give individuals autonomy over all aspects of their work from lifestyle and creative freedom to team and compensation. We believe in a future where creatives and makers aren‚Äôt tied to any one employer but can freely contribute to communities, like Nouns, that excites them. We believe in the power of working independently, together. That means members run their own independent practices but share resources, risks, and opportunities as a community, working together in groups when projects call for it, or individually at other times. Over time, Vector hopes to prove this new model of working that other communities and builders can replicate, sustainably working for public goods and moving web3 forward.\n\n## Budget\n200 Wheatpaste posters in Times square, Williamsburg, SoHo [1]: **20 ETH ($36,000)**\n8 Independent artists‚Äô commission [2]: **100 ETH ($180,000)**\nNFT mint mini-site design & dev [2]: **10 ETH ($18,000)**\nContribution process blog post w/ photos [2]: **0 ETH**\nTotal: **130 ETH**\n\n_[1] Vendor: TBD, evaluating several proposals_\n_[2] Vendor: Vector DAO Community_\n\n\n## Timeline\n**June 6, 2022** Artwork finished and sent to printers\n**June 20, 2022** Wheatpaste posters printed and posted around NYC\n**June 24, 2022** NFT minting closed\n\n## Artist work sample\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/d11dgfR.png)\n_Shawna X (http://shawna-x.com/, https://twitter.com/shawnax, https://www.instagram.com/shawnax/)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/E5h0QiU.png)\n_Danny Jones (https://yasly.com/, https://foundation.app/@yasly, https://twitter.com/yasly)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/Hc9nMJq.png)\n_Adam Ho (https://www.adamho.com/, https://twitter.com/omgadamho, https://foundation.app/@adam)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/KGVtNIO.png)\n_Elijah Anderson (https://www.instagram.com/spacehose)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/1Gazydq.png)\n_Moon Collective (moon-collective.com, www.instagram.com/mooncollective)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/8DbrpCv.png)\n_Lulu Lin (https://www.instagram.com/da__h_/, https://super-noodle.com/, https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/lulu-lin-illustration-050319)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/WtWop9N.png)\n_Haruko Hayakawa (https://www.haruko.co/, https://www.instagram.com/harukohayakawa/, https://foundation.app/@haruko/)_\n\n",

Each unique poster design will be posted in a grid of 8 (all 8 posters will be the same artwork), with different designs being posted in their own grid of 8 across different locations, creating a scavenger like hunt to collect all 8 artworks.\n\nEach poster will have a QR code that will allow individuals to mint 1 of 150 limited editions of each artwork. There will be 1,200 total mints at a price of 0.15 ETH each. All primary and secondary sales will go to the Vector DAO treasury to be used to purchase a Noun, replenishing the Nouns treasury. Any remaining ETH post Nouns acquisition will be split among the artists and team. As a stretch goal, we will try to support having the first 25 mints of each artwork be free, allowing this drop to be accessible to more people ‚Äì this will depend on our ability to find an elegant sybil resistant solution in time.\n\nVector will provide photographers to take photos of all the posters to share on social to boost visibility (blurring out the QR code) as well as write an article about our collaboration experience with Nouns DAO to help future creators make proposals.\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/HB7iq5Y.png)\n\n## What‚Äôs in it for Nouns DAO?\n### Spread the Nouns meme\n- We're putting up 200 giant posters (6ft tall) around NYC during a high visibility week + taking photos to share online\n- The artwork will be done by a roster of top tier artists with their own audience and community\n- There's a fun game attached to being the first to find the posters and mint the limited NFTs, creating a viral loop to share back online\n- Vector DAO will use proceeds from the mint to purchase a Noun, forming a long term relationship between Vector and Nouns, helping replenish the treasury, and cementing the culture of paying it forward to more nounish builders\n\n### Pave a path for more creatives to contribute to Nouns\n- We'll bring 8 really amazing artists into the Nouns universe, who will then talk about it with their friends, driving more high caliber builders to the Nouns universe\n- This also forms a relationship with Vector DAO, a community of 80 super strong makers who are excited to further contribute to nouns\n- We'll write an article about the entire process to help onboard more makers into the community\n\n## The Artists\n[Shawna X](https://shawna-x.com) | New Yorker, Academy Awards, Nike, Google\n[Elijah Anderson](https://www.instagram.com/spacehose/) | Adidas, SNS / New Balance, Popeye‚Äôs\n[Lulu Lin](https://www.instagram.com/da__h_/) | Adobe, MAYDAY Magazine, Migrant Journal \n[Adam Ho](https://www.adamho.com/) | Cash App, Beat Foundry, Airbnb, Nike\n[Danny Jones](https://yasly.com/) | Grammy‚Äôs, Nike, New Balance\n[Haruko Hayakawa](https://www.haruko.co/) | New York Times, Bon Appetit, Fly by Jing\n[Moon Collective](https://www.instagram.com/mooncollective/) | Saturdays NYC, Instagram, Popi CBD\n_And more (pending proposal approval)_\n\n## The concept: Independent, together\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/bYQ8hIH.jpg)\n_(Similar concept for Art Basel in 2021)_\n\nWe‚Äôre commissioning 8 artists with distinct styles to create a series of posters remixing Nouns, showcasing each artist‚Äôs unique styles and perspectives (illustration, 3D, typography, color, etc). To create a consistent visual motif across the posters, the artwork must feature a Nouns artifact, but interpreted however the artist sees fit. Vector will have these artworks printed on 200+ wheatpaste posters and posted around the NFT NYC conference in Times Square and in neighborhoods like Williamsburg and SoHo.\n\nEach poster will have a QR code where viewers can mint 1 of 150 limited edition NFTs of that poster‚Äôs artwork. Each NFT edition will have a mint price of 0.15 ETH and be sold using the [Zora Protocol](https://create.zora.co/).\n\nWe hope the end product not only propagates the Nouns brand and reflects the power of placing goods in the public domain, but also the power of individuals in forming digital communities like Vector to create across both digital and physical mediums.\n\n## About Vector DAO\nVector DAO is a collective of artists, designers, and developers in web3. Our mission is to give individuals autonomy over all aspects of their work from lifestyle and creative freedom to team and compensation. We believe in a future where creatives and makers aren‚Äôt tied to any one employer but can freely contribute to communities, like Nouns, that excites them. We believe in the power of working independently, together. That means members run their own independent practices but share resources, risks, and opportunities as a community, working together in groups when projects call for it, or individually at other times. Over time, Vector hopes to prove this new model of working that other communities and builders can replicate, sustainably working for public goods and moving web3 forward.\n\n## Budget\n200 Wheatpaste posters in Times square, Williamsburg, SoHo [1]: **20 ETH ($36,000)**\n8 Independent artists‚Äô commission [2]: **100 ETH ($180,000)**\nNFT mint mini-site design & dev [2]: **10 ETH ($18,000)**\nContribution process blog post w/ photos [2]: **0 ETH**\nTotal: **130 ETH**\n\n_[1] Vendor: TBD, evaluating several proposals_\n_[2] Vendor: Vector DAO Community_\n\n\n## Timeline\n**June 6, 2022** Artwork finished and sent to printers\n**June 20, 2022** Wheatpaste posters printed and posted around NYC\n**June 24, 2022** NFT minting closed\n\n## Artist work sample\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/d11dgfR.png)\n_Shawna X (http://shawna-x.com/, https://twitter.com/shawnax, https://www.instagram.com/shawnax/)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/E5h0QiU.png)\n_Danny Jones (https://yasly.com/, https://foundation.app/@yasly, https://twitter.com/yasly)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/Hc9nMJq.png)\n_Adam Ho (https://www.adamho.com/, https://twitter.com/omgadamho, https://foundation.app/@adam)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/KGVtNIO.png)\n_Elijah Anderson (https://www.instagram.com/spacehose)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/1Gazydq.png)\n_Moon Collective (moon-collective.com, www.instagram.com/mooncollective)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/8DbrpCv.png)\n_Lulu Lin (https://www.instagram.com/da__h_/, https://super-noodle.com/, https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/lulu-lin-illustration-050319)_\n\n![N|Solid](https://i.imgur.com/WtWop9N.png)\n_Haruko Hayakawa (https://www.haruko.co/, https://www.instagram.com/harukohayakawa/, https://foundation.app/@haruko/)_\n\n",

And Nounish Friends.\n\nAs Nouns continues to strive to be a household name throughout the world, our team began to think, let us not lose our tie to our everyday life. We are not necessarily here to use our digital space as a means to escape the real world, but rather, as a means to improve it. An ethos and belief that we know many Nouners also feel.\n\nWith this in mind and our team‚Äôs love and experience in the international coffee industry, we come to the DAO and the Nouns Community with a proposal for Nouns Coffee, the first ever Nounish consumable brand. With hopes of being on the shelves of your favorite cafe, local market, or frequented grocery store. With the potential of someday having special real world locations at the corner of your favorite neighborhood to meet up and sip a cup with some of your closest nounish friends.\n\n### Nouns Coffee Brand\n*Below you will find key details on how our team plans to bring this prolific coffee brand to life.*\n\n## Phase One\n### Coffee\n\n- For Phase One of Nouns Coffee, the team will be sourcing a high-quality roaster in order to whitelabel for the brand. (read more about the potential plans for phase 2 and 3 later in this proposal)\n- Our team will use their connections within the coffee industry to find the right partner to roast our coffee. We will work diligently to ensure the highest quality coffee. This includes virtually hosted cupping sessions where we will send the roasts around to members of the community so we can all decide on the roasts together.\n- All coffee will be fair trade and organic. We care deeply about not only who drinks our coffee, but the hands that were instrumental in the planting, growing, harvesting, and roasting of our coffee.\n- Phase One will include a variety of different single origins as well as a variety of blends so that all of our nounish palettes are satisfied and caffeinated (and decaffeinated for you weirdos).\n\n### Ecommerce\n\n- In order to get Nouns Coffee into as many cups as possible, we will build an ecommerce site in order to streamline operations and provide trustworthy purchasing and shipping of Nouns Coffee.\n- This will be inclusive of a custom web experience reflective of the existing Nouns brand, to ensure a cohesive experience.\nWe will most likely use Shopify along with an integration of Coinbase Commerce in order to accept payments in crypto as well.\n- The team will work on Web3 integration to enable all Nounders and Nouners to access and claim certain coffees/roasts for free as part of their participation in the DAO.\n\n### Collateral/Advertising\n\n- Beyond just caffeinating you, we will provide you with vessels to sip from as you listen to hosted noun o‚Äôclock spaces by CDT, while at work, or out for your morning walk.\nWe will create custom cards to place in each order with QR codes (or similar) sending people to nouns.wtf so they can check out the daily auction while brewing their morning coffee.\n- Phase One will also include the creation of other nounish collateral like tote bags to carry around your coffee, your mug, your books, your HW, you name it. We‚Äôll work with the community to decide what pieces of collateral will be best used to show off your love for the community and your love for coffee. Proliferation is the name of the game.\n\n### By Nouns for Nouns\n\n- Being a Nounder/Nouner will open the door for monthly perks from Nouns Coffee. This may come in the form of monthly coffee deliveries, custom mugs and totes, and even ‚ÄúNoun of the Month‚Äù featured roasts where Nouners can have their Nouns featured on the packaging etc.\n- Beyond being a Nounder or a Nouner, if you hold a Nouns Bidder POAP (brkfstsndwch‚Äôs first project for the DAO), you will also have the chance for added features and perks from Nouns Coffee.\n\n### (If prop is approved by June 9th) Soft Launch at Korea Blockchain Week 2022 in August\n\n- In collaboration with alphanonce, holders of Noun 75, we will be the Coffee Break Sponsers of Korea Blockchain Week in 2022.\n- Being the Coffee Break Sponsors of the event means:\n- Possibly the greatest branding exposure at KBW2022 as attendees are\nconstantly searching for their next cup of coffee. Branding will include\nfull-colored signage at all coffee stations, and on branded napkins and\ncoffee sleeves.\n- Thousands of eyes, and mouths, witnessing the glory of Nouns and Nouns Coffee.\n\n### Project Timeline\n#### Phase One Accelerated for Korea Blockchain Week\nFull Timeline Can Be Viewed [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G1l5sQb3JRQ5C0NGSklu_KoSe4p0KWk_/view)\n*Branding and Coffee Ready for KBW | 8-10 Weeks from Approval of Proposal*\n\n#### Phase One (if not approved by June 9th)\n4-8 Weeks | Roaster Sourcing for Whitelabel\n4-8 Weeks | Brand Identity\n6-8 Weeks | Packaging Design\n4-6 Weeks | Packaging Production\n6-8 Weeks | Collateral Design\n6-8 Weeks | Collateral Production\n6-8 Weeks | Website Design + Development\n2-4 Weeks | Coffee Production (begins after roaster is sourced)\n*Site is Live and First Bags Shipped | 12-18 Weeks from Approval of Proposal*\n\n## Phase Two\n*Sourcing/Roastery | Warehouse Leasing and Hiring Head Roaster*\n- Upon the successful adoption of Phase One and dependent on the demand for more coffee, we will submit a second proposal to lease our own warehouse and roaster, while also hiring a head roaster to roast and produce our own coffee.\n- The pros to this are the eventuality of bringing down costs, allowing us to keep our quality high, and giving us the opportunity to produce at scale.\n- A successful Phase Two will also set us up with a better position to execute on Phase Three (read below).\n- More details will of course be shared with the Nouns Community throughout Phase One as we begin thinking towards a Phase Two.\n\n## Phase Three\n*Nouns Cafe*\n- A real world cafe, bringing the meme to life. Imagine you are walking down the cobblestone streets of soho and you look to your right to see a bright red figure appear, to realize it‚Äôs a pair of noggles. The sweet aroma of nougat, chamomile, and chocolate fill the air. It pulls you in. Taking a step through the door, you see a few patrons sporting Salvino Armati‚Äôs noggles, clinking their Nounish mugs, and bidding on the auction for the day.\n\n### Team\nBrkfstsndwch | Producer and Project Manager, Liaison to Nouns Community\n**Experience:** Builder in the Nouns Community since inception, executing Nouns Bidder POAPs as their first major project with the DAO.

      "content": "# Nouns Children's Book Development\n\n*Copied from [Nouns Discourse](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-children-s-book-development/1231/11) on behalf of @brandonmighty*\n\nHey Nouners,\n\nYou may have seen me (Brandon James Scott / @brandonmighty) on twitter or around the discord. I‚Äôve been making Nouns-inspired art like my [Myth of Noun collection on Superrare](https://superrare.com/series/0xca4607aad52f654cf6357895c397094c077a3236) and my [Nouns at Work collection on Foundation ](https://foundation.app/collection/nounsatwork).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/N70U3r8.jpg)\n\n*The Myth of Noun & Nouns at Work collections*\n\nI am an artist with over fifteen years of experience in children‚Äôs entertainment via animation and publishing. I‚Äôm writing this proposal because I think the world needs a Nouns children‚Äôs book - and I‚Äôd like to make one.\n\n**Goals**\nIntroduce the fun, positive energy of Nouns to a young audience (and their parents). Create a wonderful nounish illustrated experience in physical form. Open a path to the traditional publishing world for Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/biSbsDm.jpg)\n\n**I am a Noun**\n\nI am a Noun (tentative title) will be an illustrated book for young children where we meet, learn about, laugh with, laugh at, argue with, understand, admire and ultimately love the Nouns. It will read like a curious journey with occasional reader involvement instead of a traditional linear story. For those familiar with children‚Äôs books, think along the lines of Julie Morstad‚Äôs Today, Oliver Jeffer‚Äôs Here We Are, or Richard Scarry‚Äôs Best Word Book Ever - these books take a big idea and explore them visually and nonlinearly.\n\nThe book may start with asking a simple question to the reader: What is a noun? Our Nouns characters will have their opinions on this, which will lead to more questions, and more opinions - often at odds with each other and the narrator, with the reader stuck in the middle of it all. The book will be curious, funny, smart, absurd, and nounish‚Ä¶ always. And it might end with another question for the reader: What kind of noun will you be?\n\nYou already have an idea of what it might look like. I don‚Äôt see the book as fully painted as my Myth of Noun pieces - probably more minimal like Nouns at Work with characters on simple backgrounds. And like the art I‚Äôve done, I will base as much as possible on official Nouns traits. I‚Äôll also be adding new characters (people, places, things‚Ä¶) and will put the Nouns glasses on almost everything.\n\nIt should be noted that the story will not directly reference the dao, nfts, crypto, ect. I would consider this project a very gentle trojan horse for nouns for a brand new audience.\n\nI will also encourage and welcome any input from the Nounders as I develop this story to keep the nounish vibes in check. ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\n**Package**\n\nThis is not funding for a finished book, but rather funding for the development of a book submission package. Once a successful submission and sale takes place, the publisher would acquire publishing rights and offer an advance so that I may finish the rest of the book.\n\nI have literary representation (Emily Van Beek at Folio Jr. literary agency) who has already shown interest and encouraged me to pursue this idea. I will work with her to fine tune this submission and once we‚Äôre both confident that it‚Äôs ready, she will work on my behalf to find a publisher for it.\n\nI‚Äôd like funding from the DAO so I can devote time to write, illustrate and develop this idea into a package that would include:\n\n* A finished manuscript\n* A book ‚Äòdummy‚Äô (a sketched out layout of the full book)\n* 2-3 pages of finished art\n* Cover art\n\nThis amount of material makes up a strong package which solidifies all the main creative decisions (the concept, the story, the content and flow of the pages, and the final art style) for a confident submission.\n\nThe goal would be to have material ready to submit to publishers in fall 2022.\n\n**Funds Requested**\n\n15 ETH\n\n**Caveats**\n\n* There is a small possibility that the normy publishing world may struggle to support a project based on a nft collection, or using a public domain ‚Äòbrand‚Äô, or because we just don‚Äôt get it all those weird heads. I don‚Äôt believe any of these things will happen because A) I believe I can create a wonderful, unique book that publishers will want, and B) I love the Nouns, and I believe many others will too.\n* I‚Äôll be relying on my agent for her experience and advice with regard to submitting, and any and all publishers, from the big 5 to smaller indie publishers may be considered. In the event that a traditional publishing deal proves difficult, self-publishing could be another option, in which case I would return to the DAO to explore further funding for production and distribution with a separate proposal.\n* The DAO should anticipate that any book published with a traditional publisher will most likely end up in a more traditional copyright situation and not CC0.\n\n**TL;DR** - I‚Äôm asking for 15 ETH to develop a robust submission package for a Nouns children‚Äôs book for traditional publishing.\n\n**About Me**\nI‚Äôve worked for over 15 years in animation as an art director, director and creative director at Guru Studio on a range of hit animated series including Paw Patrol, True and the Rainbow Kingdom, Pikwik Pack, and Mecha Builders. I‚Äôm also the creator of my own series, the Emmy-nominated Justin Time.\n\nI‚Äôm the illustrator of I Was Born a Baby and I Live in a Tree Trunk with Harper Collins, A Bear, a Bee, and a Honey Tree with Astra Publishing/Hippo Park, Cow Says Meow with HMH, Snow Falls with Penguin Random House/Tundra Books, and The Dog Who Wanted to Fly with Annick Press. I am represented by Emily Van Beek at Folio Jr. 1 literary agency.\n\nYou can see more of my work and experience on my website, brandonjamesscott.com 4\n\nThank you for reading and considering this proposal!",

      "content": "Full Proposal with rich media here:\nhttps://nouns.wtf/vote/77\n__\n\nHere is Nerman: https://twitter.com/nermanbot\n\nNerman is a community bot for Nouns. Nerman can also be a great friend. A shoulder to cry on. A guiding light.\n\nIn Discord he will help with coordinating group votes on DAO proposals (ie Nouncil), informal Nouner polling, offer helpful commands, post all relevant Nouns DAO activity, and allow the community to easily share content to Social Media. On Twitter he will listen for Nounish content and cleverly decide what is the top content to reshare.\n\nNerman will be open source, and Nounish communities can clone him and tap into the Nouns protocol within their own Discords. Every subdao with a Nouns vote needs a Nerman. Every subdao with twitter needs a Nerman curating their feed.\n\nDELIVERABLES\nTwo Discord bots, a Twitter social listening bot, two websites, and a distribution ready open source library.\n\nTIMELINE\n6 Months (multiple collaborators)\n\nBUDGET\n\n69.420 ETH\n\n1. PROPOSER: JOEL CARES\n\n\nJoel has been building in Nouns since November. This projects coincides with him shifting into full time Nounish work, the beginning of many years of Joel x Nouns collaboration. Alongside (and separate from) this project he will be actively taking meetings in the entertainment / tech / comedy / animation worlds to spread the Nounish word and help groups put together proposals.\n\nSocials: Twitter - Instagram - Facebook - LinkedIn\n\nJoel is:\n\na Nounish Meme\na founding member of Nouncil\nthe current elected Nouncil Ambassador to Nouns DAO\nhelping admin Prop 63\nbuilding Noggles.wtf\nrunning Crispy Nouns\nmaking 3D at JoelCares.net\nCEO of ANOA.ca\nCEO of Lobal Global\n2. PREAMBLE\nEarlier this year we received support from Small Grants to develop Nerman 1.0 - a basic version of Nerman with social sharing and simple Discord commands. Nerman 1.0 is alive and well!\n\nCurrently running in private server\nManually retweeted and shared ~3000 Nounish posts as NermanBot\nCurated 4 Twitter lists: Nouners, Nouncillors, Nounish Projects, Nounish Content Mines\nTo showcase Nerman we released Lil Nerman, a development bot currently running in NIL Discord.\n\nwill reshare Discord post content to when :nerman: emoji used\nhas basic commands (/noun and /nouner)\nWe have also completed a first version of Noun O'Clock bot that anyone can add. It is currently running in NIL and NounsDAO Japan.\n\nshows time to Noun O'Clock in bot status\nposts link to FOMONouns.wtf at Noun O'Clock\n2. DISCORD BOT - NERMAN\nThe Nerman Discord bot can help with internal governance and polling, sharing community news to the world, connecting people, lending a hand. A true friend.\n\n2. A.) DISCORD - SIMPLE VOTING\n\nNouncil / subdaos all use emoji polls to vote on Nouns DAO proposals. It's messy and a lot of work. Nerman can fix this.\n\nProblems - Discord Emoji Polls\n\npeople can vote for more than one option\nif emoji votes are public, anybody can add reactions. Because of this you have to manually go through and manually tally results.\npeople can add unwanted emojis, cluttering the poll.\nwhen the vote is finished you have to manually mark it closed and post the results.\nthe results aren't stored in a database, and there are no broad statistics calculated from them\nSimple Voting - Features\n\nallow / disallow voting based on Discord roles (public, Nouner, Nouncillor...)\nvotes can be anonymous, or public. For anon votes participation will still be tracked but actual vote content won't be stored\ncan enforce one vote per user, or allow multiple\nspecify an end time\nlive visual feedback, which can be turned on or off\nuses Discords new button API\nstores votes in a database in preparation for future web apps that display voting stats\nbasic API for db queries so others can build with this data\nFUTURE GOALS\n\nconsider further voting methods: weighted voting, ranked choice, quadratic. Can any reliably be done from Discord?\nmanage and deploy votes from web app\ncreate Snapshot vote and post to Discord\npossibly automate executing Nouns DAO vote\n2. B.) DISCORD - SOCIAL SHARING\n\nNounish Discords are contain a stream of Nounish content, creators put their soul into noggley creations and the world needs to see it. Nerman can fix this.\n\nIn V1.0 we implemented basic social sharing, active in the NIL Discord and the @LilNerman account.\n\nFEATURES - COMPLETED\n\nuser reacts \"Nerman\" emoji, Nerman responds with \"NERMAN_BLAST\"\ntext & media (image, gif, video) are formatted appropriately for twitter\nthreshold function that determines how many votes needed to share\nFEATURES - NEW\n\nbetter media handling, adding support for large videos and any other misc media that needs to be formatted and handled for Twitter\ncreate Nerman social media accounts on other platforms (instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn). Format it appropriately and post it there as well\ntest thoroughly and improve error handling and messages\nif user's post is just a tweet, allow Nerman to simply retweet\nfurther develop Twitter thread functionality for long text posts\ntest the Threshold functionality with live public, tweak and dial in\nexperiment with Threshold calculations in an active Discord\n2. C.) DISCORD - COMMANDS\n\nSome people live in Discord.They live and breath Discord. They don't want to go on the internet to find Nounish facts and assets, they want it In-The-Chat. Nerman can... ah, whatever, you get it.\n\nV1.0 Nerman implemented the following commands using https://noun.pics\n\n/noun [id]\nReturned a PNG of the specified Noun in an ephemeral response.\n\n\n\n/nouner [address or ENS]\nReturned a grid showing the Nouns owned by that address.\n\n\n\nFEATURES - NEW\nWe will switch to the Nouns DAO subgraph and offer more details.\n\n/nerman noun [id]\nCan display a more detailed ephemeral message about the Noun. It could possibly include: a PNG image, the last sale price, current owner, basic DAO voting stats, other Nouns owned... we will try to express the most useful content in a minimal clean way.\n\n/nerman nouner [address or ETH address] [include delegates]\nWe will change this to an ephemeral with more stats about that address, including owned Nouns and delegated Nouns. Possibly things like auctions won, etc.\n\nOther Useful General commands\nWe‚Äôd like to add further useful commands as we think of them, while also not clogging up the Nouns command space. We will experiment!\n\n2 D.) DISCORD - BOT MESSAGES\n\nNerman will be active in the Discord posting useful things about the State of Nouns, social media, and anything else he can chime in on.\n\nFEATURES\n\nWhen a new Nouner !joins Nerman will provide a welcome package with all links and instructions required to enjoy their Nouns experience.\nWhen someone wins an auction Nerman will look on ENS for connected Social Media accounts and try to tag them with a Warm Welcome when possible\nAll State of Nouns events will be available with nice formatting: new auction, bids, auction end, new DAO proposal, proposal executed, etc\nNotifications whenever a Noun is transferred - if it occurs on a marketplace with an API (OpenSea, LooksRare, Zora) we will provide appropriate metadata like price\nThese notifications will be configurable - work with the commmunity to figure out which ones are useful, turn the rest off\ntop daily Twitter messages\n2. E.) DISCORD - ADMIN CONFIG\n\nIn the beginning Nerman will only be allowed in approved Discords under the devs watchful eyes. We will tweak, and improve, and help Nerman be the best bot he can be.\n\nOnce Nerman is a well built, reliable bot, we will build out a simple config system for people to install and configure Nerman to run in any Discord and share to any social media accounts.\n\nFEATURES\n\nconfigure which \"State of Nouns\" events post, and to which channel\nconfigure which social media accounts Nerman posts too, including posting to your orgs own social media\nwhere Nerman listens for posts to share to social media\nturn options on and off (swear filter, welcome committee, etc)\ncustomize messages things like the Noun O'Clock message\nchange language\n3. DISCORD BOT - NOUN O'CLOCK\nNoun O'Clock bot is a very basic fork of Nerman that does two simple things:\n\nCounts down to the next Noun O'Clock in the bot status:\n\nAt Noun O'Clock - posts a link to FOMO Nouns in the designated channel:\n\nThis is currently running in several discords, including NounsDAO Japan and NIL. You can download and install the current version of Noun O'Clock here: https://nounoclock.wtf/\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\nIntegrate new State of Nouns libray\nAdd more details to announcement link, including an image of the sold Noun, sale price, and buyer address.\n4. TWITTER BOT - NERMAN LISTENER\nNerman surfs through social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instawhatever, etc), sharing, caring, looking for primo Nounish content to showcase. He is on a mission to automate his Twitter account. Nerman will try to figure out novel ways to find high quality Nounish content and decide which ones should be shared to @NermanBot. This will take some experimentation, we have ideas but will be trying them out and continuously refining.\n\nFEATURES\n\nNerman will listen on Twitter @NermanBot tags. In the beginning he will retweet all of them, and when there are too many, will develop further metrics for choosing what to Tweet.\nNerman will listen for common Nounish content, like \"@nounsdao\", \"#nouns\", and \"‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\" and share the top results.\nNerman will share important events from the State of Nouns, including saying hello to New Nouners when an auction finishes,\nNerman will compare content from all methods and ensure only a reasonable amount of tweets are sent each day.\nbroadcast Nerman activity to additional social networks: Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn\nIf the DAO desires Nerman can eventually post directly to @NounsDao.\n\n5. WEBSITE - NERMAN.WTF\nNerman will maintain a presence in the old web at https://nerman.wtf. There will be some fun, basic info about Nouns DAO, a guide to following Nerman and Nouns activity, and a web app that displays voting stats from Discord polls.\n\nFEATURES\n\na summary of Nerman and Nerman's activities\ndiscord bot documentation\nState of Nouns documentation\ninstructions on how to engage with Nerman on Twitter\nlinks to all Nerman social media\nbreakdown of vote results and decisions made\nbreakdown of behaviour across all votes, including user behavior (if not anon)\n6. WEBSITE - NOUNOCLOCK.WTF\nNerman will maintain a very basic site for Noun O'Clock. It's already complete.\nhttps://nounoclock.wtf/\n\nFEATURES\n\na website with stuff on it. Go look\n7. JS LIBRARY - STATE OF NOUNS\nWHEN DO THINGS HAPPEN?! Nerman needs to know, and so do other Nounish bots. When a Nouns auction ends, when a proposal is created, when a Noun sells on OpenSea. Nerman needs these events, and the data associated with them.\n\nState of Nouns is a standalone JS library for the Nounish community. Nerman will use it, and any other JS project can use it to accurately get events from all Nouns DAO activity.\n\nOur first priority is developing this fully for Nerman. Afterwards we will package and release it as an open source, free standalone library.\n\nFEATURES\n\nprovides access to all Nouns events across governance, NFTs, etc\nwill report all Noun transfers. Will report sale metadata if on OpenSea, LooksRare, or Zora\nsimple JS library that can be incorporated into other projects\nuser provides own Web3 connection details (supports various JSON-RPC options)\nno centralized service, simply fork the code and run your own\n8. USER ROLES & META DATA RESEARCH\nDiscord user roles are often verified with Collab.Land. Nerman will be able to function with existing User roles.\n\nWe will experiment with other options in a separate Discord, try to find a better way. We have specific advanced Nerman functionality we want to explore. There are solutions like The Guild and devcarrot's custom idea. A simple connection to ENS would also be great.\n\nFUNCTIONALITY RESEARCH GOALS\n\nconnect Discord username -> wallet address -> Twitter username so we can correctly tag users on Twitter when sharing. This could be a custom app, or there might be existing tools we can use.\nNOUNS: automating \"Nouner\" Twitter list to automatically add new Nouners, and remove Nouners who sell their Noun\nif people have ENS with twitter and Discord usernames added we can tag people live as the Nouns auction bids happen, and we could send winners nice welcome messages on Twitter and Discord.\nWe will publish our findings as a guide for other communities to follow\n9. RECURRING COSTS\nHOSTING & MAINTENANCE\n\nDiscord Bots\nNerman\nNoun O'Clock Bot\n\nTwitter Bots\nNerman Listener\n\nWebsites\nNerman.wtf\nNounOClock.wtf\n\nCode Libraries\nState Of Nouns JS\n\nAll of these will need to be hosted and maintained over time. We will be in Discord and on Twitter paying attention to quality and listening to the community. We will publish the State of Nouns library on something like NPM, ensure it's accessible to devs, and answer questions from the community.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT\n\nNerman has been active since January: https://twitter.com/NermanBot/\n\nThe account has been operated manually by Joel Cares for about 5 months now (almost 3000 RTs!) and involves scouring Twitter for content daily. We will continue this for 6 more months, until Nerman is ready to automate the content curation and take over the reigns.\n\nOnce Nerman Bot is live, we will still loosely moderate the feed to ensure quality is kept high and nothing Vile comes through. As the algorithms are tweaked to perfection this moderation will no longer be needed.\n\nFEATURES\n\nConstant content moderation to ensure quality\nManual curation of Nounish Content Lists until they can be automated\n10. PRIORITY USE CASES\nOnce Nerman is live these are our top priority use cases:\n\nNOUNS: #nouncil-vote\n\na channel where only Nerman can post\nvotes are automatically created for every new DAO proposal\nNouncillors can also create votes through /nerman vote command\nNouncillor role has 1 vote per user\nvotes last 60 hours, after which they close and display results\nNouncillor manually process Gnosis Safe vote\nsimple stats to help ensure Nouncillors are participating\nNOUNS: #nouner-poll\n\nonly Nerman can post\nNouners can create polls through /nerman command\nNouners have 1 vote per Noun\nVotes have 72 hour period.\nused for informal consensus gathering only. Used to gauge Nouner opinions, help choose between options when writing proposals, judge contests... Quick and s\n",

      "content": "# Make Nouns Visible From Space : IRL event space \n\n[Discourse Proposal](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/make-nouns-glasses-visible-from-space-part-of-the-permanent-record-google-earth-maps/1126)\n\n**Request for 150 ETH to:**\n1. Fund installation of Nouns glasses VISIBLE FROM EARTH ORBIT\n2. Serve as venue retainer for future Nouns IRL events\n3. Establish Nouns DAO as a founding supporter of charity beer garden that will utilize the space\n4. Provide drone photography of finished project and initiate media coverage\n\n**Benefits:**\n1. Imprint Nouns upon the permanent record via Google Earth, Google Maps, etc.\n2. Retain two venues for IRL Nouns events in the US Midwest\n3. Reinforce the Nouns ethos by supporting a community-oriented charity event series\n4. Raise Nouns awareness and proliferation potential on a previously unrealized scale\n\n![Event Space](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/2X/0/0d7ffadc9ee9fe961e06d937ecc2a31cf2273d46.jpeg \"Event Space\")\n\nThe DAO has already funded a Nouns expedition space and the ISS. This proposal will MAKE NOUNS VISIBLE FROM SPACE by installing a pair of Nouns glasses large enough that they‚Äôll be seen from orbit and for long enough to be included when satellite maps are updated in Google Earth/Maps, etc. They‚Äôll become part of the permanent record, visible even to normies that don‚Äôt frequent NFT social media. The glasses will appear less\nthan 300 yards from the largest stadium in the US (third largest in the world) and one of the largest universities ‚Äî a destination for hundreds of thousands every year. It‚Äôs also an area that has undergone major municipal and private development over the past 12 months so updates to online maps are sure to follow.\n\nNouns funding will fulfill multiple goals simultaneously: the biggest and most visible being the massive Nouns glasses, obvious not only to online navigators but to in-person visitors and media providing ground & aerial coverage during sporting events. The glasses will be included as part of a synthetic turf upgrade at the site and will align with a North-oriented map display for a natural viewing angle. Replacing the natural lawn with\nsynthetic turf will improve durability at the site and preserve the Nouns glasses long enough for the next satellite maps update to take place.\n\nFunding will also serve as a retainer for Nouns IRL events in a Midwest US city accustomed to large gatherings and a short drive from an international air hub. The Nouns community is welcome at the charity beer garden and can also request a private visit. Nouns DAO will have access to a 10,000 square foot outdoor site and a\npremium residential venue for any dates not reserved for charity events).\n\nInstallation of the Nouns glasses at the site will identify Nouns DAO as an advocate for community-oriented events in public spaces and will benefit a well-established charity beer garden that began at this location in 2016. The family-friendly public tailgate successfully attracted tens of thousands of patrons each season (before a pandemic hiatus) and grossed six figures for cancer programming.\n\nA licensed drone photographer will capture photos of the Nouns glasses in situ so that images and Nouns backstory may be included in a press release for local and national media. The owner/manager of the charity event spent 26 years as a professional photographer and has numerous media and connections, including a spouse in the publishing and PR industry.",

Alongside (and separate from) this project he will be actively taking meetings in the entertainment / tech / comedy / animation worlds to spread the Nounish word and help groups put together proposals.\n\nSocials: Twitter - Instagram - Facebook - LinkedIn\n\nJoel is:\n\na Nounish Meme\na founding member of Nouncil\nthe current elected Nouncil Ambassador to Nouns DAO\nhelping admin Prop 63\nbuilding Noggles.wtf\nrunning Crispy Nouns\nmaking 3D at JoelCares.net\nCEO of ANOA.ca\nCEO of Lobal Global\n2. PREAMBLE\nEarlier this year we received support from Small Grants to develop Nerman 1.0 - a basic version of Nerman with social sharing and simple Discord commands. Nerman 1.0 is alive and well!\n\nCurrently running in private server\nManually retweeted and shared ~3000 Nounish posts as NermanBot\nCurated 4 Twitter lists: Nouners, Nouncillors, Nounish Projects, Nounish Content Mines\nTo showcase Nerman we released Lil Nerman, a development bot currently running in NIL Discord.\n\nwill reshare Discord post content to when :nerman: emoji used\nhas basic commands (/noun and /nouner)\nWe have also completed a first version of Noun O'Clock bot that anyone can add. It is currently running in NIL and NounsDAO Japan.\n\nshows time to Noun O'Clock in bot status\nposts link to FOMONouns.wtf at Noun O'Clock\n2. DISCORD BOT - NERMAN\nThe Nerman Discord bot can help with internal governance and polling, sharing community news to the world, connecting people, lending a hand. A true friend.\n\n2. A.) DISCORD - SIMPLE VOTING\n\nNouncil / subdaos all use emoji polls to vote on Nouns DAO proposals. It's messy and a lot of work. Nerman can fix this.\n\nProblems - Discord Emoji Polls\n\npeople can vote for more than one option\nif emoji votes are public, anybody can add reactions. Because of this you have to manually go through and manually tally results.\npeople can add unwanted emojis, cluttering the poll.\nwhen the vote is finished you have to manually mark it closed and post the results.\nthe results aren't stored in a database, and there are no broad statistics calculated from them\nSimple Voting - Features\n\nallow / disallow voting based on Discord roles (public, Nouner, Nouncillor...)\nvotes can be anonymous, or public. For anon votes participation will still be tracked but actual vote content won't be stored\ncan enforce one vote per user, or allow multiple\nspecify an end time\nlive visual feedback, which can be turned on or off\nuses Discords new button API\nstores votes in a database in preparation for future web apps that display voting stats\nbasic API for db queries so others can build with this data\nFUTURE GOALS\n\nconsider further voting methods: weighted voting, ranked choice, quadratic. Can any reliably be done from Discord?\nmanage and deploy votes from web app\ncreate Snapshot vote and post to Discord\npossibly automate executing Nouns DAO vote\n2. B.) DISCORD - SOCIAL SHARING\n\nNounish Discords are contain a stream of Nounish content, creators put their soul into noggley creations and the world needs to see it. Nerman can fix this.\n\nIn V1.0 we implemented basic social sharing, active in the NIL Discord and the @LilNerman account.\n\nFEATURES - COMPLETED\n\nuser reacts \"Nerman\" emoji, Nerman responds with \"NERMAN_BLAST\"\ntext & media (image, gif, video) are formatted appropriately for twitter\nthreshold function that determines how many votes needed to share\nFEATURES - NEW\n\nbetter media handling, adding support for large videos and any other misc media that needs to be formatted and handled for Twitter\ncreate Nerman social media accounts on other platforms (instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn). Format it appropriately and post it there as well\ntest thoroughly and improve error handling and messages\nif user's post is just a tweet, allow Nerman to simply retweet\nfurther develop Twitter thread functionality for long text posts\ntest the Threshold functionality with live public, tweak and dial in\nexperiment with Threshold calculations in an active Discord\n2. C.) DISCORD - COMMANDS\n\nSome people live in Discord.They live and breath Discord. They don't want to go on the internet to find Nounish facts and assets, they want it In-The-Chat. Nerman can... ah, whatever, you get it.\n\nV1.0 Nerman implemented the following commands using https://noun.pics\n\n/noun [id]\nReturned a PNG of the specified Noun in an ephemeral response.\n\n\n\n/nouner [address or ENS]\nReturned a grid showing the Nouns owned by that address.\n\n\n\nFEATURES - NEW\nWe will switch to the Nouns DAO subgraph and offer more details.\n\n/nerman noun [id]\nCan display a more detailed ephemeral message about the Noun. It could possibly include: a PNG image, the last sale price, current owner, basic DAO voting stats, other Nouns owned... we will try to express the most useful content in a minimal clean way.\n\n/nerman nouner [address or ETH address] [include delegates]\nWe will change this to an ephemeral with more stats about that address, including owned Nouns and delegated Nouns. Possibly things like auctions won, etc.\n\nOther Useful General commands\nWe‚Äôd like to add further useful commands as we think of them, while also not clogging up the Nouns command space. We will experiment!\n\n2 D.) DISCORD - BOT MESSAGES\n\nNerman will be active in the Discord posting useful things about the State of Nouns, social media, and anything else he can chime in on.\n\nFEATURES\n\nWhen a new Nouner !joins Nerman will provide a welcome package with all links and instructions required to enjoy their Nouns experience.\nWhen someone wins an auction Nerman will look on ENS for connected Social Media accounts and try to tag them with a Warm Welcome when possible\nAll State of Nouns events will be available with nice formatting: new auction, bids, auction end, new DAO proposal, proposal executed, etc\nNotifications whenever a Noun is transferred - if it occurs on a marketplace with an API (OpenSea, LooksRare, Zora) we will provide appropriate metadata like price\nThese notifications will be configurable - work with the commmunity to figure out which ones are useful, turn the rest off\ntop daily Twitter messages\n2. E.) DISCORD - ADMIN CONFIG\n\nIn the beginning Nerman will only be allowed in approved Discords under the devs watchful eyes. We will tweak, and improve, and help Nerman be the best bot he can be.\n\nOnce Nerman is a well built, reliable bot, we will build out a simple config system for people to install and configure Nerman to run in any Discord and share to any social media accounts.\n\nFEATURES\n\nconfigure which \"State of Nouns\" events post, and to which channel\nconfigure which social media accounts Nerman posts too, including posting to your orgs own social media\nwhere Nerman listens for posts to share to social media\nturn options on and off (swear filter, welcome committee, etc)\ncustomize messages things like the Noun O'Clock message\nchange language\n3. DISCORD BOT - NOUN O'CLOCK\nNoun O'Clock bot is a very basic fork of Nerman that does two simple things:\n\nCounts down to the next Noun O'Clock in the bot status:\n\nAt Noun O'Clock - posts a link to FOMO Nouns in the designated channel:\n\nThis is currently running in several discords, including NounsDAO Japan and NIL. You can download and install the current version of Noun O'Clock here: https://nounoclock.wtf/\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\nIntegrate new State of Nouns libray\nAdd more details to announcement link, including an image of the sold Noun, sale price, and buyer address.\n4. TWITTER BOT - NERMAN LISTENER\nNerman surfs through social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, Instawhatever, etc), sharing, caring, looking for primo Nounish content to showcase. He is on a mission to automate his Twitter account. Nerman will try to figure out novel ways to find high quality Nounish content and decide which ones should be shared to @NermanBot. This will take some experimentation, we have ideas but will be trying them out and continuously refining.\n\nFEATURES\n\nNerman will listen on Twitter @NermanBot tags. In the beginning he will retweet all of them, and when there are too many, will develop further metrics for choosing what to Tweet.\nNerman will listen for common Nounish content, like \"@nounsdao\", \"#nouns\", and \"‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\" and share the top results.\nNerman will share important events from the State of Nouns, including saying hello to New Nouners when an auction finishes,\nNerman will compare content from all methods and ensure only a reasonable amount of tweets are sent each day.\nbroadcast Nerman activity to additional social networks: Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn\nIf the DAO desires Nerman can eventually post directly to @NounsDao.\n\n5. WEBSITE - NERMAN.WTF\nNerman will maintain a presence in the old web at https://nerman.wtf. There will be some fun, basic info about Nouns DAO, a guide to following Nerman and Nouns activity, and a web app that displays voting stats from Discord polls.\n\nFEATURES\n\na summary of Nerman and Nerman's activities\ndiscord bot documentation\nState of Nouns documentation\ninstructions on how to engage with Nerman on Twitter\nlinks to all Nerman social media\nbreakdown of vote results and decisions made\nbreakdown of behaviour across all votes, including user behavior (if not anon)\n6. WEBSITE - NOUNOCLOCK.WTF\nNerman will maintain a very basic site for Noun O'Clock. It's already complete.\nhttps://nounoclock.wtf/\n\nFEATURES\n\na website with stuff on it. Go look\n7. JS LIBRARY - STATE OF NOUNS\nWHEN DO THINGS HAPPEN?! Nerman needs to know, and so do other Nounish bots. When a Nouns auction ends, when a proposal is created, when a Noun sells on OpenSea. Nerman needs these events, and the data associated with them.\n\nState of Nouns is a standalone JS library for the Nounish community. Nerman will use it, and any other JS project can use it to accurately get events from all Nouns DAO activity.\n\nOur first priority is developing this fully for Nerman. Afterwards we will package and release it as an open source, free standalone library.\n\nFEATURES\n\nprovides access to all Nouns events across governance, NFTs, etc\nwill report all Noun transfers. Will report sale metadata if on OpenSea, LooksRare, or Zora\nsimple JS library that can be incorporated into other projects\nuser provides own Web3 connection details (supports various JSON-RPC options)\nno centralized service, simply fork the code and run your own\n8. USER ROLES & META DATA RESEARCH\nDiscord user roles are often verified with Collab.Land. Nerman will be able to function with existing User roles.\n\nWe will experiment with other options in a separate Discord, try to find a better way. We have specific advanced Nerman functionality we want to explore. There are solutions like The Guild and devcarrot's custom idea. A simple connection to ENS would also be great.\n\nFUNCTIONALITY RESEARCH GOALS\n\nconnect Discord username -> wallet address -> Twitter username so we can correctly tag users on Twitter when sharing. This could be a custom app, or there might be existing tools we can use.\nNOUNS: automating \"Nouner\" Twitter list to automatically add new Nouners, and remove Nouners who sell their Noun\nif people have ENS with twitter and Discord usernames added we can tag people live as the Nouns auction bids happen, and we could send winners nice welcome messages on Twitter and Discord.\nWe will publish our findings as a guide for other communities to follow\n9. RECURRING COSTS\nHOSTING & MAINTENANCE\n\nDiscord Bots\nNerman\nNoun O'Clock Bot\n\nTwitter Bots\nNerman Listener\n\nWebsites\nNerman.wtf\nNounOClock.wtf\n\nCode Libraries\nState Of Nouns JS\n\nAll of these will need to be hosted and maintained over time. We will be in Discord and on Twitter paying attention to quality and listening to the community. We will publish the State of Nouns library on something like NPM, ensure it's accessible to devs, and answer questions from the community.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA MANAGEMENT\n\nNerman has been active since January: https://twitter.com/NermanBot/\n\nThe account has been operated manually by Joel Cares for about 5 months now (almost 3000 RTs!) and involves scouring Twitter for content daily. We will continue this for 6 more months, until Nerman is ready to automate the content curation and take over the reigns.\n\nOnce Nerman Bot is live, we will still loosely moderate the feed to ensure quality is kept high and nothing Vile comes through. As the algorithms are tweaked to perfection this moderation will no longer be needed.\n\nFEATURES\n\nConstant content moderation to ensure quality\nManual curation of Nounish Content Lists until they can be automated\n10. PRIORITY USE CASES\nOnce Nerman is live these are our top priority use cases:\n\nNOUNS: #nouncil-vote\n\na channel where only Nerman can post\nvotes are automatically created for every new DAO proposal\nNouncillors can also create votes through /nerman vote command\nNouncillor role has 1 vote per user\nvotes last 60 hours, after which they close and display results\nNouncillor manually process Gnosis Safe vote\nsimple stats to help ensure Nouncillors are participating\nNOUNS: #nouner-poll\n\nonly Nerman can post\nNouners can create polls through /nerman command\nNouners have 1 vote per Noun\nVotes have 72 hour period.\nused for informal consensus gathering only. Used to gauge Nouner opinions, help choose between options when writing proposals, judge contests... Quick and s\n",

The SIP was approved 8 months ago (Oct 1, 2021) and has a remaining budget of 17.94 ETH. SIP-00031 limits the purchase of an NFT to a 1 ETH Maximum.\n\nRecently a Nouns derivative project called [Lil Nouns](https://lilnouns.wtf/) launched. Lil Nouns is an expansion DAO based on¬†[Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/), Lil Nouns DAO works to create a new layer within the Nouns ecosystem; Nouns as kids. By expanding the ecosystem, Lil Nouns DAO aims at exposing more people to Nouns.\n\nLil Noun 33 is the first Shark in the Lil Noun's collection. It was purchased by SharkDAO member dropnerd for 2.1 ETH (+0.027 ETH for gas). dropnerd has offered it to SharkDAO at costs (2.127 ETH).\n\nAt 2.127 ETH, this purchasse is above the limite of 1 ETH set by SIP-00031, and requires a vote. \n\nAs Lil Noun's is a thriving Nouns derivative project, it would be consistent with the SharkDAO ethos to own the first shark. This purchase would come out of the previously erstablished Curation budget.\n\n# Initial Transaction Details\ndropnerd made 3 bids at auction to win this Lil Noun. The first 2 bids were returned when outbid but the gas was not. \n[Bid 1](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8ef0fe4bccaaf476ea8d71a4a1f85927212edf13bbb37c4ce2547c052dd8b7c2) (gas 0.0087)\n[Bid 2](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xff82012df61fe676990144941b5ae277b14dacc46f0045e9154bc92425987f8e) (gas 0.0091)\n[Bid 3 (Winning Bid)](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x144ce5cc1b661ab05185ea617d8c49bddd196f9239dadc9e381e8104179ddaf8) (gas 0.0093)\nTotal = 2.1 (winning price) + 0.0087 (bid 1 gas) + 0.0091 (bid 2 gas) + 0.0093 (bid 3 gas) = 2.127 ETH\n\n# Summary\nThis is a proposal to purchase Lil Noun 33, the first Lil Noun Shark, from Shark member dropnerd, who is offering at the winning auction price of 2.1 ETH (+0.027 ETH gas) and would be paid for with the Curation budget which has 17.94 ETH remaining.",

As Juicebox is currently closed, this represents the only entrance method into SharkDAO. Uniswap allows our DAO to capture better fee's (1%) on the liquidity we provide.\n\nAdditionally, the multisig may add up to 10 ETH more to the LP. This is to allow for bigger positions to enter into the DAO. \n    \n## Risks\n- Uniswap ends up being worse for us in some manner than Sushiswap",

The event is the highest discipline of rallying governed by FIA.*\n\n*Being a native of Kenya, I decided to take into my care a team of 3 drivers both of who have extensive experience and have boasted great results in the rallies they have participated in. Mr Andrew Muiruri, the lead driver, who started his career under the FIA young stars and his co-driver Mr.Edward, one of the most experienced rally drivers in the Southern hemisphere, boasting over 51 podium finishes over a period of over 10 years ,by sponsoring them with 3 stock cars for modification,and to get them registration to be able to participate in the World Rally Championship.*\n\n[![Fia](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/044a29041eb3f76db7e423bd85fc93b1c9823b00.jpeg)](https://www.fia.com/events/world-rally-championship/season-2022/2022-world-rally-championship)\n\n# Proposal\n*I am proposing that my racing team partner with the Nouns in the World Rally Championship Safari Rally that is scheduled for the 24th of June. The initial ask is a one-time off cost and the rally team will be able to participate in future events (upto 20 events) for the next three years thereabout for almost a tenth or less of the current ask. (aprx 8-12 ETH)*\n\n# Benefits\n\n*This will be the first time any NFT project has participated in Rally sports, more so the biggest Rally event in the world, generating lots of publicity from people in and out of the Crypto fraternity. The same event last year generated 832 million impressions world-wide, from streaming sites(Red Bull TV, WRC+).*\n\n*‚Ä¢Nounified branding of team race cars and gear.\n‚Ä¢Registration costs paid to the WRC.\n‚Ä¢Servicing the cars to the performance and safety standards required by FIA.\n‚Ä¢Multiple ad work and promotion during and before the event.\n‚Ä¢Mechanical and car service.\n‚Ä¢Filming personnel.\n‚Ä¢Travel and accommodation expenses for the racing team\nEvent Mechanics personnel.\n‚Ä¢Spare parts.*\n\n\n[![Stephan.L of Citroen wrecked his rally car in Poland, which his mechanics fixed completely in less than 30 min.](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/8a0a1dd79f8daa3ea56e95199a2f7bc6eeebb81f.jpeg)\n\n\n## Media & Coverage\n*The event will be broadcasted on more than 30 live sports channels in over 50 countries all over the world. The Kenyan leg of the rally garnered 832 million impressions, putting up higher numbers than the Super Bowl and the Champions League. Streaming services such as Red Bull TV and WRC+ will also stream the event live.*\n\n## WRC Rally Car\n*WRC Rally cars are built to the standards stipulated in the FIA WRC Sporting Regulations Handbook. All participating Rally Cars are inspected by FIA, the governing body,to make sure they are up to safety and performance standards to the letter.*\n\n*Like all competition cars, a rally car features a roll cage, upgraded suspension and a strong braking system. In order to pound rough roads at high speeds, however, they require sturdier parts.\nBeefier engine mounts ensure the block won‚Äôt shake loose on bumpier road sections, while a thick aluminium skid plate prevents sharp rocks from lacerating an otherwise vulnerable oil pan. Meanwhile, bespoke wheels and tyres are essential for dealing with varied, challenging terrain.*\n\n*Today‚Äôs WRC cars are built to the specification set by the international motorsports governing body the FIA.In 2011, rules for WRC cars became more restrictive. Cars were smaller models and exotic materials such as titanium, magnesium and composite were forbidden expect when present in the base model. Initially, gear changes had to be made with a mechanical system, so the use of paddle shifters was not allowed, however this was reversed in 2015.*\n\n*In 2017, manufacturers were given more freedom to maximise aerodynamic performance, while the turbo restrictor diameter was increased from 33 mm to 36 mm, increasing the engine‚Äôs power output from 310 bhp to 380 bhp.*\n\n\n## Promotion and Nounified Onsite Clothing & Accessories\n*During the course of the Rally all members of Team Nouns will be donning some form of nounified apparel. The Rally driver‚Äôs and their co-drivers, the mechanics and the engineers (Service team) will wear noun safari hats or baseball hats to shield themselves from the scorching African sun.\nThe team will also be supplied with nounified towels to use after completing each leg. Any sort of supplies will also be carried around the site in nounified duffels. We plan to give away loads of t-shirts and umbrellas to willing spectators. Hoodies will be worn by the team throughout their stay in and out of venue*\n\n## Outdoor Advertising\n*There will be a total of 3 ads bearing Nouns DAO selected media. One billboard, one vide adboard and a projection mapping on the Kenya International Conference Centre*\n\n[![Ad1](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/ff6b265c6355db6c1464d7e5257135b873b8740d.jpeg)\n\n[![Ad2](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/original/1X/1054a7bdfd1de50a4134a85f1c78c3b1d30ab4ae.jpeg)\n\n\n# Funding Request: 153 ETH\n**Pool 1: 150 ETH (50 ETH per Rally Car x3)**\nCost of Vehicular upgrades - 15 ETH per car\nRacing Gear - 5 ETH per car\nSafety Equipment - 10 ETH per car\nService team equipments - 10 ETH per car\nSpare Parts - 10 ETH per car\n[**A comprehensive and detailed breakdown of Pool 1 allocation is linked here.**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AjtoTcl4akPtc3_sHE6lnP13jEU)\n\n**Pool 2: Sponsored by an external Sponsor**\nUsed to cater for the cost of hiring engineers,mechanics, fuel differentuals, registration costs and event fees.\n[**A comprehensive and detailed breakdown of Pool 2 allocation is linked here.**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AjtoTcl4akPtd3yjyKfOShmsHes)\n\n**Pool 3: 3 ETH**\nAccomodation for the nouns team\nTravelling expenses\nPromotion\nMedia\nAdvertisment coverage.\n[**A comprehensive and detailed breakdown of Pool 3 allocation is linked here.**](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AjtoTcl4akPteQDVMzB5b-Xrwx4)\n\n*I plan to make a small grants request to compensate the artists responsible for the designing of the car wrap,racing suits and helmets and ads*\n\n*The team received external sponsorship of 40 ETH that will be deposited into Pool 2 (22 ETH) and the remainder covering part of Pool 3 (Originally 21 ETH now down to 3 ETH)*\n\n\n**Transaction Details:**\n```\ntx1: 153E to 0x6fbcB02a48505d396ceD4ACE46bf69754C72f197 (prop funding)\ntx2: 0.5E to apenoun.eth (prop coordination)\n```\n\n\n",

      "title": "SharkDAO Creator Contests",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nCreator contests are an experiment in creating incentive systems for community creatives, builders, and artists via retroactive rewards. An eth/erc-20 rewards pool is reserved for winners of periodic contests initiated by SharkDAO. At the close of a contest submission period, SharkDAO members vote on submissions to contest prompts and rewards are distributed according to the voting results.\n\nCreator Contests will bring more builders to the SharkDAO Community, drive positive engagement amongst existing members, and reward members for creating valuable content that benefits the entire community.\n\n# Motivations\n\n- Incentivize creatives/artists/builders with voting power or other rewards\n- Offer path to membership via proof of work which may otherwise be unattainable\n    - Looking forward, it‚Äôs possible that SharkDAO membership costs (pfp / token) could price out constructive community members. Contests could be utilized to allow individuals to gain access by winning contests.\n- Gamify collaboration amongst community members\n    - With various tunable contest parameters, SharkDAO leaders can create scenarios that incentivize participants to collaborate. This could surface as the creation of new community projects, proposals, and efforts.\n- Form a social graph that allows committee/project leads to steward creators into ongoing projects and potential contributor roles\n    - As SharkDAO continues to grow and more concurrent projects are underway, project leads can reference prior contest results as talent pools to be more proactive about recruiting creatives to ongoing efforts.\n- Increase voter turnout\n    - Theoretically, incentivising creators and ushering them into ongoing projects will, as a byproduct, turn them into thoughtful/honest governance participants if they aren‚Äôt already.\n\n# Balanced Incentive Structure\n\nWith various tunable parameters, the DAO has ultimate flexibility to create and test balanced incentive structures that can help grow and strengthen the community.\n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmTx1EKBN7v9wqqm5ogf6F2cGaHaBFt2ntPHuFgMVpyFWK)\n\n# How does it work?\n\nSee below example contest\n\n1. SharkDAO creates a contest with a duration of 1 week and a reward pool of 100,000 $SHARK. SharkDAO defines winners as the 3 submissions that receive the most votes. 60% goes to 1st place, 30% to 2nd, and 10% to 3rd.\n2. SharkDAO creates prompts for the contest. Examples of possibly interesting prompts include novel nounish artwork, SharkDAO lore, jokes, memes, development work, etc.\n3. SharkDAO starts the contest.\n4. Submittors visit the contest and post their submissions to prompts.\n5. Submission period ends.\n6. Voting period begins.\n7. SharkDAO members vote on their favorite submissions.\n8. Voting period ends.\n9. Votes are tallied and top 3 winners are paid according to contest configuration.\n\n*Functional Block Diagram*\n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmYg5aEBkyoC2NNMoSexL6Son2bDpAjABhRHdPGJLs8mxY)\n\n# Tunable Contest Parameters\n\nThe following are parameters that contest admins can customize.\n\n## Basic Parameters\n\n| Parameter      | Description |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Contest Duration      | Length of contest       |\n| Contest Rewards   | ERC-20 / ETH reward pool        |\n| Winner Reward Distribution      | Rewards distribution amongst N winners       |\n\n## Advanced Parameters\n\n| Parameter      | Description |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Results Visibility      | Are voting results visible during the contest?       |\n| Submittor Rules   | (per prompt) who is allowed to submit? (restrict by discord roles / erc-20 balance / erc-721 balance)        |\n| Voter Rules      | (per prompt) who is allowed to vote? (restrict by discord roles / erc-20 balance / erc-721 balance)         |\n| Voter Strategy      | BalanceOf - Token allowance based on erc-20 / erc-721. Uniform - Each voter gets X number of votes for the contest |\n| Voter Rewards  | Share of rewards pool allotted to voters that correctly choose the winning submissions |\n| Anonymous Submissions     | Toggle anonymity of submissions during contest       |\n\n# Gamification\n\nAs previously mentioned, the tunable parameters allow DAO admins to be extremely flexible and creative in experimenting with different incentives.\n\nFor example, let‚Äôs say that SharkDAO creates a contest with the following parameters.\n\n- 50,000 $SHARK reward\n- 1 contest winner\n- Winner is defined as submission with 2nd most votes\n- Winning submission submittor receives 80% of reward pool\n- Winning submission voters receive 20% of reward pool\n- Results are visible during the voting process\n- Voting power is based off of $SHARK balance\n\nWith the above parameters, a market is created in which submittors are ‚Äòstaking‚Äô their creations, and voters are ‚Äòstaking‚Äô their votes. There are clear incentives for both voters and submittors to participate in the contest. For submittors, nothing changes from a standard contest. For voters, strategies emerge. Voters may have to work together in order for their stake to pay off. Relationships and possibly even new projects/proposals are born from this collaboration.\n\nThe above configuration is only meant to serve as an example of how SharkDAO admins can tweak contest parameters to create complex incentive systems.\n\n# FAQ\n\n**Q1**: How will transactions work?\n\n**A1**: For this system, there will be 2 types of ‚Äòtransactions‚Äô. \n\nThe first will be from the DAO contest creators to transfer contest rewards into the contest smart contract. This interaction on the UX will be designed to accept transactions from either a multisig or standard wallet. The gas liability will fall on the DAO / contest creators. \n\nThe second type of transaction will be from the contest web application to the contest smart contract upon completion of the voting period. Once winners are calculated according to the contest parameters, a function in the smart contract will be triggered to disburse rewards to the winners. We will handle this gas liability.\n\n**Q2**: Where will this software be hosted?\n\n**A2**: This software will live in Calabara. Calabara is an application we have been developing for some time now that is designed to easily support useful community applications, like this one. Once the new website is completed, and if other contributors feel it makes sense, we will be happy to integrate the creator contest implementation directly on the new site.\n\n[https://calabara.com/sharkdao.eth/dashboard](https://calabara.com/sharkdao.eth/dashboard)\n\n**Q3**: How many contests can happen at the same time?\n\n**A3**: Only 1 contest can be ongoing at any given time.\n\n**Q4**: How will contest prompts be selected?\n\n**A4**: Contest prompts will be selected based on the interests of community members / participants. This can be sampled via discord polls or other means. Ongoing efforts / projects in the DAO can also influence contest prompts. \n\n**Q5**: Who will be responsible for facilitating contests? \n\n**A5**: We are happy to facilitate contests. This will include rallying community creatives, notifying members of deadlines, and helping to choose relevant prompts. We would love to have other SharkDAO contributors help drive the contests, and would hope to eventually hand this responsibility over to other contributors.\n\n**Q6**: Will contest results be auditable?\n\n**A6**: Yes\n\n# Milestones\n\nMilestone 1: Contest web application\n\nMilestone 2: Contest escrow contract\n\nIn the spirit of building an MVP, we will first deliver the contest web application. After the web application has been delivered, we can then concurrently facilitate contests as well as work on milestone 2. The contest escrow contract will simply automate the holding and disbursement of rewards. In the period between milestones 1 & 2, the disbursement of rewards will be a manual procedure. We will generate a report from the contests which sharkDAO can then use to manually transfer assets to winners.\n\n# Budget\n\nWe are requesting 2 transactions totaling 7 eth for the completion and delivery of the product.\n\n‚Ä¢ Transaction 1:  4.5 eth delivered upon proposal successfully passing.\n\n‚Ä¢ Transaction 2:  2.5 eth delivered upon completion of milestone 1.\n\n‚Ä¢ Receiving address ‚Äî> 0xa943e039B1Ce670873ccCd4024AB959082FC6Dd8   (calabara.eth)\n\n# Who is involved?\n\n- Nick (nickdodson#5975) - core dev\n- Yungweez (yungweez#8281) - dev, designer\n\n# Estimated delivery\n\n- The above is expected to be completed within **60** days, with regular deliverables, reporting, and collaboration.\n- All generated code will be open source software hosted on github.\n\n# Post delivery\n\n‚Ä¢ We will maintain, support, and continue to develop the product after the 60 days.\n\n# Risks\n\n- We don‚Äôt deliver.\n- Product is not up to standards of what is presented.\n- Project takes longer than expected.\n\n\n\n*Contest Prompts Mock*\n\n![image](ipfs://QmPUb9e1E7J4z5H6azNfLtcf9Xs1Xb59cuHXorK7tyDKjM)\n\n*Submission Prompts Mock*\n\n![image](ipfs://QmU336eDyZtTkUdbTZUF3f7yNqEU6GRHy2mjQxzTyNkHRN)\n",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 73",
      "content": "# Nouns Around Town - a Documentary Film Proposal from the makers of Robot Chicken\n\nWe propose producing a comedic documentary film about the groundbreaking nature of the Nouns DAO and the web3 community and our weird journey of getting the Nouns featured in the Rose Parade. The Noun community has shown itself to be forward thinking, enterprising, generous, warm, funny and bold. Everything from donating to Ukraine, making eye glasses for the underprivileged, to being featured in a Super Bowl ad. This is a story worth telling!\n\nThis project will be unique for three reasons:\n\n1. Stoopid Buddy has spent years developing a very specific comedic tone we want to bring to this documentary. The doc will tell the story of the Nouns community and all the amazing initiatives it supports, but will be anchored with a strong narrative - the journey of getting the Nouns into the Rose Parade as the first ever NFT featured. This narrative lends itself to keeping things fun, silly and strange, while providing a strong hook to tether the larger story of Nouns.\n2. As part of the documentary story, we'll be building and featuring six life-size walk around Noun costumes that will spread the Noun ethos through activities the community will have a say in driving. Do we want them handing out glasses? Giving random hugs to people in Times Square? Running in a charitable half marathon? We'll have fun and create great content for the documentary, all while showcasing how the DAO works.\n3. Our story will revolve around the journey to get a giant, vibrant Noun float in the Pasadena Rose Parade in 2023. The film will reach a climactic end with the six life size Nouns partying their way down the Rose Parade with a massive Noun float in tow!\n\n_Tone_\n\nWe're inspired by docs like \"Exit Through the Gift Shop\" which was light, playful, and blurred the line between real and imagined. We want to tell this story in an imaginative way, often with tongue firmly in cheek.\n\n_Why?_\n\nWe are inspired by this community and think the world needs to know how amazing and revolutionary this DAO is. We also think this is a great way to get this organization and brand out to a much wider audience. The Rose Parade will create tens of millions of impressions but the documentary will give this story life and legs and tee up the Nouns to further their reach into mainstream pop culture.\n\n_Who are we?_\n\nWe are [Stoopid Buddy Stoodios](https://www.leagueofbuddies.com/). Most of you might know us from our flagship series, [Robot Chicken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuWZzOusVJ8), but we're also the studio behind Marvel's MODOK, Crossing Swords on Hulu, and all the costumes on FOX's [Masked Singer](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/the_masked_singer-characters-publicity-split-h_2019.jpg). And the studio that built a 15 foot walk around for [League of Legends](https://www.leagueofbuddies.com/news/buddy-builds-at-pax-east/). We've been nominated for over [22 Emmys](https://www.emmys.com/shows/robot-chicken) and won six of them. We've also won Cleo Awards for our advertising work and have worked with brands from DC, Marvel, Walking Dead, Star Wars, LEGO, Target, and [Denny's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBLThhKIoFM) among many others. All that is to say we know how to translate the spirit of a brand into entertainment. We're also the studio that last year built a life-size walk around goat Noun that made [an appearance at NFT.NYC](https://twitter.com/grelysian/status/1456665812182487048). While our ambition for the next round of life size Nouns is even greater, this experience was amazing, and a source of inspiration for what's to come.\n\nBut we don't want to do this alone. We want to bring the entire Nouns community together to help tell this story. We've been amazed by the early positive support of this proposal and are excited to engage with you all. Nouners will have the opportunity to participate by voting on where these life size \"Nouns in the Wild\" go on their journey, and even participate by walking along with other Nouns in the actual Rose Parade. The documentary will feature interviews with Nounders and Nouners alike, and highlight projects that have been successfully funded and what type of impact they've made. This will be a movie making experience that engages the entire community.\n\n### BENEFITS TO THE NOUNS DAO\n\n\nROSE PARADE\n- HUGE AWARENESS OPPORTUNITY TO TELL THE NOUN STORY\n_(all data below provided by the Tournament of Roses staff)_\n  - Rose Parade seen by 22 million people in the US, and in over 60+ countries across the world\n  - 1,000,000 people line the streets in Pasadena for the parade, and another 150,000 visit the floats pre and post parade\n  - 1.8M+ social impressions\n  - 20 seconds of airtime during telecast with scripted description for Nouns\n  - Inclusion of the float in printed program\n  - Estimated media value of media coverage $300M\n\n\nDOCUMENTARY\n- First documentary about a DAO community to fully tell the Nouns story and cement their place in public imagination, but in a way that's funny and on-brand for both the Nouns and Stoopid Buddy Stoodios.\n- The Nouns community will vote on random acts of joy that our Nouns will spread throughout real world communities as part of our documentary so we can highlight other initiatives the DAO funds and feature other Nounish events.\n- Sequels and other content opportunities to expand on the story we tell in the documentary. Our plan is to take any net proceeds from the sale of the documentary and reinvest them into more Nouns content.\n\n### PHASES OF EXECUTION\n\nPHASE 1: (May-July)\n\n- Select and design the six life-size Nouns\n- Sign contract with the Rose Parade team for 2023\n  - (NOTE: Document each of these phases with our production team)\n- Line up interviews and identity storylines for the documentary (those that would like to remain anonymous will be free to do so)\n- **MILESTONE 1 - Fund 45% of proposed allocation\\***\n\nPHASE 2 (July-September 2022)\n\n- Begin building out the Noun costumes for the documentary and the parade\n- Begin the designs that will ultimately become the massive Rose Parade float\n\nPHASE 3 (August-September)\n\n- Community votes on winning float design\n- Approve the build\n- **MILESTONE 2 - Fund 45% of proposed allocation\\***\n\nPHASE 4 (September 2022-January 2023)\n\n- Film interviews and storylines for the documentary including the \"Nouns in the wild\" segments\n- Film behind the scenes of the parade build and the day of festivities.\n- Release short segments of the film to build awareness and hype for the parade.\n\nPHASE 5 (January-Feb 2023)\n\n- Party at the Rose Parade!\n- Post-Production and editorial cut\n- Screen film exclusively to the Nouns community for feedback on final cut\n- Determine best distribution outlets for the film\n- **MILESTONE 3 - Fund final 10% of proposed allocation\\***\n\nPHASE 6 (Q2/3 2023)\n- Distribution. Our objective is to maximize viewership with wide distribution. Tactics may include submitting to festivals, pitching to streamers and networks (SVOD), or even distributing on AVOD services like YouTube to keep from being behind paywall. We'll make this decision with transparency and will confer with Nouns DAO as we consider options.\n\n_\\* Milestones to be funded at commencement of each phase. Note that these are guidelines only and that a final determination will be made in collaboration with the stoopid-buddy-escrow multisig._\n\n### BUDGET\n\n- Parade fee - $23k USD\n  - Paid to Pasadena Tournament of Roses\n- Float build - $400k USD\n  - Inclusive of design, build, and storage. We will solicit creative proposals/bids from each of the three Rose Bowl Parade approved float building companies and select one to help us build the float.\n- Six life-size Noun costumes - $330k USD\n  - Inclusive of design and build and storage\n- Film production - $450k USD\n  - Inclusive of crew, travel, accommodation, equipment, editing, post-production, music, legal, etc.\n- 1 Noun\n  - We want to be part of this story!\n\n*MULTISIG*\n\nThe proposed budget + 15% to cover volatility will be released in ETH to a 2 of 3 multisig with signers 4156, gremplin, and 9999. The ETH will be immediately converted to USDC, and everything in excess of the original budget, minus 1 ETH to cover gas for the life of the multisig, will be returned to the DAO. If, due to high volatility, insufficient ETH is available to cover the proposed budget, a second proposal will top up the multisig at a later date.\n\n*TOTAL*\n\n23k + 400k + 330k + 450k = 1,203,000\n\n1,203,000 \\* 1.15 / 2269 = 609.71 ETH\n\nMultisig address: 0xC57a137BB518336A9B793442885518eE07f8DC54",

The focus of the film is to show how NFTs and Nouns are transforming people‚Äôs lives in NZ and in the world. We are aiming at international film/documentary festivals. The goal is to inspire more artists to join Nouns DAO.\n\n**WHAT?**\nA short documentary (between 8 and 10 minutes) on Dean Harvey, the artist behind Noun Cats extension.\n\n**WHY?**\nThe focus of the documentary is to show how NFTs and Nouns are empowering emerging artists and really transforming people‚Äôs lives in NZ and in the world.\n\nWe learn about the Dean‚Äôs journey from web2 to web3 and hopefully inspire others to join the web3 movement and Nouns DAO.\n\nWe plan to release the film at international film festivals and therefore expose their audiences to the Nouniverse.\n\n**VALUE PROPOSITION**\nNouns Dao to sign ‚ÄúExecutive Producer‚Äù in a documentary aimed at international film festivals. Opening credit ‚ÄúNOUNS DAO presents‚Äù at the start of the film. All the raw footage, music and artwork to be added to the Marketing Studio free resource of CC0 assets.\n\n**FUTURE / NEXT STEPS**\nAs we researched the web3 space here in New Zealand for an ongoing feature-length documentary, we found a group of very talented artists connected through NFTs and their own DAO. The Wenbreakfast DAO.\n\nSo, our next plan is to start a series of spin-offs for a streaming platform. One episode per artist in the Wenbreakfast DAO.\n\nWe hope the artists will wish to join Nouns DAO after watching Dean‚Äôs film and going through the experience of being the next talent portrayed in our documentary series.\n\n**MORE ABOUT DEAN**\nAmong other things, he is hosting pixel arts lessons on twitch for the Noun Cats community.\n\nA firm believer in the power of web3, not only he is working full-time on his project with backseats, but he is also building yet another extension, Early Birbs, with his Discord community.\n\nDuring the live sessions, the PFP traits are created with the audience, in real-time.\n\nDean is paying it forward by teaching others the art and technique that transformed his life.\n\n**BUDGET: 12 ETH**\n\nPre-production and research\nProduction: 3 days of shooting in Nelson, NZ with a 5 people team\nPost-production: Editing / Graphics / Grading and online / Audio Mix\nOriginal soundtrack\nROADMAP / TIMELINE\n\n2 months from funding to online/final cut delivered\nTEAM\n\n[Leo Clark](https://twitter.com/leoclark) Discord: leoclark.eth ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®#2267\n[Filmmaker obsessed with NFTs and Nouns evangelist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leoclarkribeiro/)\n\n[Neil Stichbury](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-stichbury-6374794/)\nDirector/producer with over 20 years of experience in factual and commercials.\n\n[Jacob Bryant](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-bryant-4144b01a/)\nDP.

      "content": "# SharkDAO: Nouns CC0 Story Foundations & Development\n\nLet's create CC0 Story Bibles that can be the foundation for future stories and inspire creatives to create their own stories, animations and Nouns content.\n\nWhen Blockbuster DAO recently proposed creating a Story Bible for Nouns there was hesitancy to fund the project for fear of establishing Canon. \n\nThrough a series of conversations with various Nouners there seems to be concensus that rather than fund only BBDAO we want to fund multiple groups to create great CC0 Story Bibles for anyone in the community build off of, fork, animate, draw, etc.\n\nI've spoken with BBDAO, Sam Ellis, StudioDAO & Greidiens who have all been following Nouns from the beginning, have great accomplishments and want to pursue this idea.\n\nWe will begin the process of creating Nounish characters, story explorations and series ideas that can lead to more and more diverse worlds built around Nouns. \n\nWe propose to create a Multi-Sig and start by funding 6 CC0 Story Bibles at ~20E each (120E total) all by accomplished writers. This seems to be a bit above industry standard but takes into consideration the CC0 requirement for this experiment.*\n\nCreative Teams (click names for more info)\n 1) [BBDAO 1 - Animated Series - Scott Albert & Will Bryan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dATW6a93NF5NelKz2PM3ap7HiOUWadFrOpcvmQurMao/edit)\n 2) [BBDAO 2 - Feature Film - Van Robichaux & Garfield Lindsay Miller](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dATW6a93NF5NelKz2PM3ap7HiOUWadFrOpcvmQurMao/edit) \n 3) [Sam Ellis - Animated Series](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yeSJcwZRSygWKAsRIJkQ2fMVY93Qcakax_YtOhOtTkU/edit?pli=1)\n 4) Studio DAO - Mixed Media Noun O'Clock - link\n 5) Greidiens/Keenan Thompson\n 6) TBD Group - \n\nA story bible typically contains a cast of characters, some story ideas, maybe a season 1 arch and is delivered in a fully fleshed out document with drawings, text, etc. Some examples can be found below:\n\nExample Story Bibles:\n[#writers-room, Nouns Discord](https://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/921486884826406982/961336684505595995)\n\nDeliverables: Based on this thread we expect each Bible to include a general world/universe outline, 15-20 Characters w/ illustrations and character descriptions, 10+ story/episode ideas. We expect these to be illustrated and 20+ pages each.\n\nThe multi-sig would pay the writers on a schedule of 30% Up Front, 20% Upon Rough Draft, 50% Upon Completion. For this first round we will be focused on writer/creator teams that have high level credits and a history of delivering professional works on time.\n\nMulti-Sig: 0x9667Ac39E7534c43Ca1A2a4a5BC4a6FFC2783458\nSharkDAO Multi-Sig (5/7 signer wallet): 0xAe7f458667f1B30746354aBC3157907d9F6FD15E\nJoshuaFisher.eth\n\nStory Foundation & Development Lead \nJawshua Fisher\nI‚Äôve been actively working with the teams, Nouners and Nouncil members on creating this proposal. I want to continue advising and consulting teams and basically providing an oversight over the whole project.\n\nMy goals for this project:\n- project oversights - payments, deliverables, DAO updates\n- advising and consulting the creative teams\n- active outreach to writers, animators and producers for consideration\n- phase 2 planning - reaching out to additional teams for production, illustration, animation, etc as well as exploring alternate ideas to create Story Foundations.\n\nI anticipate this project drives a lot interest and this comp will cover other activities that arise such as general Noun advice (I get a lot of questions and offer support for folks looking to get into Nouns or make proposals) and overall Noun Creative support/activity. For this I am proposing a compensation of 6ETH/month for trial period of 3 months.\n\nAs a creative manager by trade I have experience helping creatives deliver while holding them to high standards and helping with ideas. I've also been here paying close attention since Noun 3 and feel I have a good foundation for many of the fun moments and underlying themes that have been embraced. Finally, I'm a multi-sig signer at SharkDAO and am active in the community. \n\nLegal & Set Up Fees \nI don't have a legal quote but think we could create a simple agreement with writers with a great lawyer for 10E or less, the high cost is due to uncertainty about DAO, CC0, etc. We will send back any unused funds. Will also use this fund for reimbursing the set up of the multi-sig.\n\nTotal Funding - 148E \nCreative Teams - 120E\nDAO Oversight - 18E \nLegal Fees - 10E\n\n*To be clear if a great creator with passion shows up and wants to participate we would consider them in this group or could support through Small Grants or other mechanisms, we want all creators of all levels to work on Nouns including potentially non-CC0 interpretations.",

      "content": "# SIP-00046: Welcome to Shark Island\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis proposal details the project approved by the DAO via [SIP-00039: Shipping Shark PFP](https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth/proposal/0x98e96d3f1a0785dec9c43f51df35149979e8dcba2dc82de963e40fa67884c5c5). \n\nThis includes the expansion of SharkDAO governance into a dual-token model, revised details on release size and raise amount, and capital allocations to continue building and growing the Shark, Nouns and cc0 ecosystems.\n\n\n## Summary\n\nIn this proposal we:\n- Provide a model for SharkDAO governance to include Shark Island NFTs\n- Establish some parameters for the NFT distribution\n- Detail plans for the use of revenue from this project\n\n## Details\n\n### Shark Island     \n   - [Supplemental Product Document](https://hackmd.io/@Sasquatch/sip45product)\n   - Shark Island is a Nounish PFP and DAO ecosystem project created for SharkDAO by Shark Labs\n        - NFTs provide a fun new way to engage in governance and a long awaited PFP for DAO members\n        - Island concept creates a new set of narrative possibilities for Nouns and Shark\n        - Shark Labs is a collective of builders and contributors within SharkDAO:\n            -  Sasquatch, nicooo, Goldy, Rayo, numo, Messhup, forager, cdt, driedtoast    \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/64x82gB.jpg)\n\n### Dual Token Governance\n\n- $SHARK and Shark Island NFT's\n    - Governance votes will be enabled for both the ERC20 $SHARK and the Shark Island NFT's\n        - Weighting: 10k SHARK = 1 Shark Island NFT\n            - At suggested mint prices, this is equivalent to selling ~113636 $SHARK per ETH\n      \n   \n### NFT Allocations\n\n- There will be an open mint period in which mint passes will be available for purchase or free claim\n- A significant allocation will be added directly to our treasury\n    - Treasury allocation intended for onboarding new contributors and partners to SharkDAO\n- ~1000 (1 each) will be distributed to existing SharkDAO members \n    - Any unclaimed will be added to the treasury\n- ~1000 will be distributed in a tiered structure to community contributors\n    - Contributions to SharkDAO or Shark Island\n- 470 will be reserved by the SharkDAO team\n\n### Finances\n- Between .088-.123 price per pass\n    - Open Mint will have a discounted price relative to the subsequent ongoing faucet\n        - The Open Mint will still require you to be allowlisted to participate\n- Planned uses of funds include: \n    - Buying Nouns, supporting the cc0 ecosystem, supporting builders in our community\n    - Funding a dedicated pipeline supported through tooling infastructure + a team to shipping Nouns DAO proposals\n    - DAO treasury funds to facilitate events, community management, cc0 activities, or other governance determined activities.\n    - Continued Development of the project\n- Royalty - 100% to the DAO treasury\n    - starts at 10%, scales down to 2.5%\n\n    \n### Our Vision for the Future\n\n- With the launch of Shark Island a cc0 nounish NFT project, we reaffirm our commitment to cc0 and Nouns ecosystem activities and our position as an open and approachable community for builders, collectors and enthusiasts. \n\n### Benefits\n- Onboarding new members \n- Engaging existing members\n- Seeding the treasury to continue the DAOs mission\n- Creating a framework for subsequent projects and releases\n- Expanding the narrative of Shark and Nouns\n\n### Risks\n- The project doesn't sell out and we don't make a return on our treasury funds.\n- The team doesn't deliver on their promises and wastes treasury funds.\n- Brand reputation damage to SharkDAO if the project doesn't succeed.\n- Existing $SHARK holders are diluted by NFT issuance\n\n",

This way we ensure an inter-regional promotion of NFTs in the two biggest Cities of Bavaria (total population of ~2M people)\n\n**The first day** introduces the underlying technologies of NFTs such as blockchain and smart contracts through panels and talks. Different areas of application of NFTs and their economic significance will be presented using successful examples from the gaming, fashion and art sectors. A panel discussion will be held to critically examine the technology and its benefits and to take a visionary look into the future of NFTs. On this day, the audience will be introduced to the world of NFTs and informed about the basics and possible areas of application.\n\n**The second day** will be a deep dive into current topics and trends in Web3 and the world of NFTs. Representatives from Web3 projects and companies will present their NFT journey, current strategies and experiences. Trends, technological developments, as well as tax and regulatory aspects will be covered. The crypto and NFT communities and all interested parties are invited to exchange ideas in an interdisciplinary manner on this day.\n\nThe event is planned to attract ~400 people in-person and around the same amount to stream online over the course of 2 days.\n\n# who is organising muc.xyz?\n[Benjabo](https://twitter.com/benjabo): Benjamin Bauer (CEO of [ZOLLHOF](https://www.zollhof.de/) - Tech Incubator) is a long-time fan of blockchain technology. He first invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum in 2016 and went all-in on NFTs early 2021. Fascinated by the new possibilities of the decentralised web3, Benjamin pushes this topic for ZOLLHOF and the German startup ecosystem.\n[Cairol](https://twitter.com/cairol2_0): aerospace engineer, idea creator and value-based leader in the field of innovation and deep tech.\n[Aguwiku](https://twitter.com/aguwiku): architect and urban planner, sustainability and climate protection expert, grew up with art, big fan of tennis.\n[niftynaut](https://twitter.com/niftynaut): noun172, building [swap.kiwi](https://swap.kiwi) to help others swap their NFTs the safe way with each other.\n\n# how will the event proliferate nouns?\nIn general, as the event has an educational approach, we hope also to spread the word about cc0 and convince more builders to think about what kind of license they want to use for their future NFT projects. Moreover, Nouns are not yet proliferating in Europe and sponsoring the conference will help get more attention to the protocol outside of North America.\n\n+ We will let nouns nounify the event completely. Nouns will be THE sponsor who has their logo everywhere where the muc.xyz logo is.\n+ We will have posters around the city to draw attention to the event.\n+ We will nounify our website accordingly.\n+ We will add nouns logo on all of our merchandise which is free for all attendees.\n+ We will nounify the venue accordingly (roll-ups, photo wall).\n+ We will mention nouns in our press release.\n+ We will add a cc0 talk/panel to our event schedule\n+ We organise some side NFT exhibitions - here we have the possibility to display nouns and their story. \n+ With representatives from the city and the state of Bavaria, chances are high that there will be photos circulating in the regional and national newspapers.\n\n# event location and schedule\nwe are hosting the event at the [Haus der Kunst](https://hausderkunst.de/en/) (House of Art) which is a non-collecting modern and contemporary art museum in Munich, Germany.\n![image|\n100%](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Haus_der_Kunst_-_Munich_-_2013.jpg)\nPhotographer: Avda / avda-foto.de\n\nDate of the event is the 27th & 28th of May 2022.\n\nThe NFT event will help to educate the interested public about NFTs. We are sure this event will draw attention to NFTs and blockchain because it is touching the Zeitgeist and there are not many other events to educate the public about this technology in Germany, and so far none in Munich.\n\n**There is still a great need for education and information in Germany.** ‚Ä®**There are a few events, but they differ in their objectives and focus.** \n**So far there are not many events to compare it even with.**\n\nRight now it is a right and important time for our muc.xyz, precisely because there are so many different approaches, ideas, areas of application etc‚Ä¶‚Ä®**Our approach also stands out above all because of the first day, which focuses on critical observation and informing the broader public.** ‚Ä®On top of it, Bavaria has developed its own blockchain strategy. The added value of this technology for society, the economy and even for the administration is seen.\n\nMunich is a hotspot for art! The art scene is alive and well. There are many collectors and art enthusiasts here. There is a lot of ‚Äúold‚Äù culture and a lot of tradition. Our event fits right in as there is a vacuum currently we hope to fill.\nWe are also partnering with [Hackbay](https://www.hackbay.de) which organised many hackathons (200+ participants) and now organises its first web3 hackathon (Sponsors: Adidas, Siemens) in Nuremberg (population of ~800k).\n\nSome more info about Munich:\n* 3rd largest city in Germany, 11th largest City in the EU with a population of 1.6M\n* The city is a global centre of art, science, technology, finance and its economy is based (besides cars) on high tech, creative industries, as well as IT.\n* With large universities it attracts a lot of young people with whom it would be great to connect and educate about web3 and NFTs.\n\n# confirmed speakers\n+ [Annette Doms](https://twitter.com/Annette_Doms)\n+ [Jiayin Chen from Artnet](https://twitter.com/curatingthings)\n+ [snowfrow from Artblocks](https://twitter.com/ArtOnBlockchain)\n+ [Yat from Animoca Brands](https://twitter.com/ysiu)\n+ [Keith from TIME](https://twitter.com/KeithGrossman)\n\nLooks promising to be confirmed soon:\n[Judith Gerlach, Bavarian State Minister for Digital Affairs](https://twitter.com/gerlach_judith)\n\n# Expenses muc.xyz has\n+ venue \n+ catering \n+ event set-up \n+ technical support for the event and renting hardware (venue, exhibition, and streaming the event)\n+ advertisements (print and online)\n+ merchandise\n\n**The money from the sponsorship provided by the nouns will be used to partially cover the expenses (expenses > nouns grant). A payout from this grant to the organisers is not included**.\n\n# SUMMARY:\nwhat we ask for:\n\n15 ETH for sponsorship of the NFT event.\nWe are trying to cover costs completely through sponsorships.\nWe would be more than happy to welcome nouns in Munich for the event and have an IRL meet-up.\n\nwhat nouns get:\n\n+ We will let nouns nounify the event completely. Nouns will be THE sponsor who has their logo everywhere where the muc.xyz logo is.\n+ We will have posters around the city to draw attention to the event.\n+ We will nounify our website accordingly.\n+ We will add nouns logo on all of our merchandise which is free for all attendees.\n+ We will nounify the venue accordingly (roll-ups, photo wall).\n+ We will mention nouns in our press release.\n+ We will add a cc0 talk/panel to our event schedule\n+ We organise some side NFT exhibitions - here we have the possibility to display nouns and their story. \n+ With representatives from the city and the state of Bavaria, chances are high that there will be photos circulating in the regional and national newspapers.",

      "content": "# Nouns Esports\n\n**Goal**\nProliferate Nouns through esports initiatives, starting with the signing of a professional Dota 2 roster.\n\n**Description**\nDota2 is a multi-decade-old esport that is currently being developed by Valve Software. They host the single largest prize pool tournament in esports, The International. The latest purse for this annual tournament was around $40 million USD. To qualify for The International, you participate in the Dota Professional Circuit (DPC) 2 league which takes place throughout the year. This is mostly an online, regional format, but each season culminates in an international LAN called a Major.\n\nOne of the first initiatives of our esports pod will be to sign ‚Äú4 Zoomers‚Äù 3, a Division 1 North American DPC team.\n\n**Budget: 35 ETH**\n\nThe majority of this budget will be used to compensate the roster of five players, their manager and coach for the upcoming DPC season. The team has agreed to sign from the day the proposal is voted-in until the end of the third DPC season, July 17.\n\nWe will be working with former player and caster Brax to to act as an ambassador and liaison within the Dota community. He will be hosting and casting at least two different Nouns branded Dota tournaments.\n\nSome of the players stream individually via Twitch. We will create assets for their on-stream overlay.\n\n**Administrative Multisig**\nBrennen\nSasquatch\nMaty\nGoldy\nWag\n\n**Deliverables**\nTournament stream viewership - Their most recent series from April 16th has 283,352 views on the VOD via Twitch. Live tournament broadcasts regularly have tens of thousands of concurrent viewers\n\n1. Individual stream viewership - Some of the players on the roster regularly stream on their own while practicing (hundreds or thousands of concurrent viewers)\n\n2. In game branding - Dota allows for DPC teams to have in-game branding through assets placed inside of the game‚Äôs landscape. Nouns branding will be visible in game as the team competes.\n\n3. Name branding - The team will rebrand from 4 Zoomers to **Nouns Dota**.\n\n4. Player name branding - Player names will include a Nounish sponsor tag. e.g.\n**Gunnar.‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®**\n\nI am happy to report the team has offered us ‚ÄúRight of First Offer‚Äù for the upcoming Major and The International.\n\nThe road to TI for the team is as follows:\n\nAchieving a top 2 placement in DPC North America (June 6 - July 17) qualifies them for the Major LAN in Arlington Texas (Aug 4 - 14th)\nPerforming well at the Major qualifies them for The International.(date TBD)\n\n**Future**\nIf this pilot is deemed successful by Nouns, potential next steps include signing this Dota roster for an extended term, signing other gaming teams or esports athletes, and fleshing out an esports-focused subDAO.",

Q1 retroactive operating costs\n2. Q2 operating costs\n3. Nouncil Community Grant Program Pilot\n\n__________________\n\n1. **Q1 Retroactive Operating Costs - 10 ETH**\n__________________\n\n‚ÄúNouncillor‚Äù is a volunteer position, whose main role is discussing and voting on Nouns DAO proposals. We are requesting a reasonable budget to incentivize Nouncillors to put in additional work beyond that scope.\n\n‚ÄúOperating cost‚Äù funds would be earmarked for Nouncil administrative items such as:\n\n - Creating and operating Gnosis Safe\n - Social media management\n - Meeting notes\n - Content development\n - Website development\n - General organization\n - Nouncil proposal development & on-chain submission\n\nOperating Costs will be distributed via a collaborative Coordinape round and all Nouncillors will get an equal voice. External contributors and Nouners who helped set up Nouncil up will be invited to join the circle as potential recipients. Q1 Coordinape will be administered immediately. We will prepare a report of how the operating costs were distributed and host it on the Nouncil website publicly.\n\nProgram specific operating costs will be distributed in separate Coordinape rounds with the teams that worked on them.\n\nCurrently Nouns DAO proposal discussion on Discord and Discourse is encouraged, but still considered a volunteer activity. In the future we would like to think through and develop intuitive programs to incentivize Prop discussion.\n\n__________________\n\n**2.

      "content": "# Mad Realities x Nouns DAO\n\n# Mad Realities x Nouns DAO\n\n### **What is it?**\n\nMad Realities is building audience-owned TV, starting with an interactive reality TV network where the audience votes on cast, shows, and more via holding an NFT. Think TV, but owned by and voted by the community. \n\n**The finale taking place on May 1st at Webster Hall** is for our first show Proof of Love, a community funded, created, participated, and decided dating show powered by NFTs. Season 0 kicked off March 13th and we've already had:\n\n- 1,500+ people on the internet co-creating the show with us\n- 172 ETH worth of Membership Pass NFTs minted which funded all the show production to begin with\n- 4 IRL live shows hosted at NFT art gallery [Bright Moments](https://www.brightmoments.io/)¬†with¬†300+ audience members (max capacity of the venue)\n- Notable guests judges like [Victoria Paris](https://www.tiktok.com/@victoriaparis?lang=en), [Matt Medved](https://twitter.com/mattmedved), [Antoni Bumba](https://www.tiktok.com/@antonibumba?lang=en), [Elsie Hewitt](https://instagram.com/elsie), [Meltem Demirors](https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem), [Nolita Dirtbag](https://www.instagram.com/nolitadirtbag/?hl=en), [Aubrey Strobel](https://twitter.com/aubreystrobel), [Alex Zhang](https://twitter.com/alexzhang__), and more.\n\nThis proposal is for NounsDAO to put **50 ETH** towards the festivities alongside Zora (also contributing 50 ETH) for a chance to be 800+ 20-somethings in NYC‚Äôs first touchpoint with web3 and the endless possibilities of crypto in culture. It‚Äôs also going to be really fucking fun.\n\n### How would it work?\n\n**Date: Sunday, May 1st**\n\n**Venue: Webster Hall**\n\n**IRL Audience: 800-1000 NYC based 20-somethings (50% female)**\n\n**URL Audience: NFT holders of the episodes, Twitter** \n\n**Run of show:** In our season finale, 4 winning couples from past episodes will compete in a showdown to prove their love to the audience, where the audience is the final decider of which couple wins the jackpot prize (4.20 ETH). Anyone in the world will be able to text our hotline to vote ‚Äì similar to American Idol days ‚Äî and by doing so will be able to mint one of our condom NFTs as well ‚Äî not so similar.\n\n- 6:30pm ET - Doors Open\n- 7pm ET - Begin airing recap episodes from Season Zero\n- 8pm ET - Final Episode Airs on Youtube and live at Webster Hall\n- 8:30pm ET - One hour long live streamed After Show (with 2-3 musical performances)\n- 9:30pm ET - Winner of finale episode is chosen live\n- 10:30pm ET - Invite only after party at The Jane (you are invited to join us!)\n\n### **Why?**\n\nThe Mad Realities team has mad respect for NounsDAO as one of the pioneers of CC0 as a viable model to spread a decentralized brand & meme.\n\nWe ourselves are making that leap, and the night will mark history as Mad Realities enters Proof of Love into Creative Commons (CC0) and allows anyone to mint full episodes of the show and most meme-worthy clips, and own a piece of reality TV.\n\nIt will be a bold experiment in putting a whole TV show in Creative Commons ‚Äî along with the infinite stories that we expect our community to tell far into the future. We picture anyone in the world creating their own Proof of Love spinoff in the future ‚Äî including experimenting with new formats, mediums (TikTok vs. Youtube vs. Live Stream vs. Audio vs. Snapchat, and more), themes, locations, and casts.\n\n### **Funds Requested**\n\nThis proposal requests from the DAO:\n\n- 50 ETH to go towards the production of the festivities\n\nFunds would be used towards live after show production, venue costs, talent booking, co-branded merchandise, marketing expenses, and a portion of the bar tab at our invite only after party at the Jane Hotel (open to NounsDAO members shall the proposal be approved üëÄ).\n\n`Address for transaction: madrealities.eth` \n\n### What does NounsDAO get out of it?\n\nHelp Mad Realities herald a new era in Hollywood. In exchange, Nouns gets...\n\n1.

      "content": "# Marketing Studio for Nouns-funded Projects\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n- Fund a studio to create short videos telling the world about the projects that Nouns fund.\n- Offer builders to tap into a marketing studio with Noun-specific expertise, free of charge.\n- We will work with builders to tell their project‚Äôs story in the most digestible and compelling way.\n- We will edit these videos to fit the formats of the top social media platforms.\n- These videos will be shared on new social media accounts dedicated to telling the stories of Nouns-funded projects. The goal of these videos will be to reach new audiences to amplify the reach of the projects we have funded.\n- Create a free resource of CC0 Nouns-proposal-related footage and assets.\n\n**The Problem**\n\n- Prop builders don‚Äôt necessarily have the skills/resources/time to execute a marketing campaign for their projects.\n- Wonderful projects with really great output are not being amplified and we are missing out on a lot of noun proliferation potential.\n- It‚Äôs difficult to explain what Nouns are to the world.\n\n**The Solution**\n\n- We propose to build a team dedicated to market the projects that Nouns fund.\n- We will offer the most promising projects the option to work with us closely to produce a video that markets their project.\n- We will do whatever is necessary to make the videos as compelling and impactful as possible, like:\n    - Develop a compelling story about the project.\n    - Send a film crew to the builders' studio for an interview and B-roll footage.\n    - Edit the videos in different formats for different social media platforms to maximize virality.\n    - Publish the videos on social media accounts - on all major social media outlets: twitter, facebook, instagram, tiktok, and youtube.\n    - Manage interaction with social media followers.\n\n**Why is this awesome?**\n\n- **Tell the Nouns story via the projects we fund**\n    - The best way to tell the story of Nouns is via its funded projects. The projects and builders that the treasury funds are what is nounish. The substance of the proposals are the most compelling and accessible narratives of Nouns DAO. These stories will also attract more builders to submit proposals to the protocol.\n- **Let the builders focus on building**\n    - Builders don‚Äôt have to be marketing experts.\n    - We want to enable builders to focus on delivering their projects in the best way - and let us produce the video marketing assets they need.\n    - We hope that potential builders who see these videos will get inspired to create quality proposals themselves, knowing that this support and exposure will be there.\n- **Use the treasury to its fullest potential**\n    - An awesome Nouns-funded project that not many know about is a waste of our treasury.\n    - We will make sure to amplify the work that‚Äôs being done by our prop builders and reach a wide audience.\n- **CC0 Nouns Video Stock**\n    - Similar to public domain stock videos, all footage that we will gather in the process of producing these videos will be CC0 and available online\n        - Initially we will share a Google Drive or Dropbox with these files. We will also experiment with posting the footage in CC0 stock video websites like [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).\n        - In the future, if there‚Äôs demand, we may want to build a dedicated website to enable easy access to the footage.\n    - This will enable the composability of our storytelling by giving access to right-free footage to, for example:\n        - Projects like the [Rose Parade documentary](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-nouns-go-to-the-rose-parade-a-documentary-by-the-makers-of-robot-chicken/1046) will be able to use our raw footage as part of their documentary, permissionlessly.\n        - YouTubers who produce an explainer video about Nouns.\n        - News outlets who are reporting about Nouns.\n        - All future documentaries about the protocol.\n    - This will enable more ‚Äúmemetic stimulus‚Äù: more visual content from our projects can result in more nounish memes!\n\n**Scope of The Pilot**\n\nWe want to start with a small pilot of 4 published videos, delivered within the next few months. These videos will be 30-90 seconds, bite sized content for easy consumption and maximum shareability. They will focus on summarizing a single project/proposal ‚Äì with a little context about nouns as well.\n\nIn this pilot we want to experiment and learn as much as possible (e.g. How to work best with builders? What content type and format gets the most engagement? How do we manage remote film crews?).¬† Once we successfully deliver on the pilot and we have learned a ton, we will probably submit another proposal to produce more videos.\n\n- Work with builders to create videos telling the stories of 4 projects:\n    - Confirmed:\n        - Coloring Books by Messhup\n    - Other projects we would love to work with but haven‚Äôt fully confirmed yet:\n        - Nouns Psychogeography Sculpture with Dustin Yellin\n        - Perpetual Glasses to Kids In Need\n        - TSP x Nouns: Skateboard Design and Giveaway\n        - Luxury Noun Sunglasses\n        - Hong Kong Takeover\n        - Nouns 3D-printed fashion collection\n- Upload all relevant high quality raw footage to a cloud service and make it available to anyone.\n- Setup, brand, and manage new social accounts for Nounish on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok & YouTube\n- Share videos to social media accounts\n\n**Team**\n\n**[142](https://twitter.com/danpeguine)**\n\n- Strategy, scriptwriting, and storytelling\n- Coordinating with builders\n- Manage socials\n\n**[Goldy](https://twitter.com/Goldypix) & [Pixel](https://www.pixel.melbourne/)**\n\n- Strategy, scriptwriting, and storytelling\n- All video production: from footage to edited files, film crews\n- Visual brand assets\n\n**Questions or comments?

The objective for this round will be to empower the collective of active Nouns builders to convey Œû in a manner that attempts to effect sustained outsize benefit to Nounish Culture.\n\n**Procedure** \n1. Funds custodied in the Nouncil (nouncil.eth) multisig, which signers and their constituents (Nouncillors) have agreed to defend according to the above mandate. \n2. Open call will be held in the Nouns Discord Server for Nouners/Nouncillors wanting to co-administer. \n3. Administrators will refine a process for adding candidates who are interested in participating, biasing for inclusivity where possible, while considering how the process may be sustainably implemented at protocol level in future.\n4. If nominated, addition of non-voting addresses (NounsDAO/SubDAO Treasuries, Public Goods etc) as potential beneficiaries may be considered.   \n5. Approved contributors will be allowlisted / encouraged to participate in an off-chain weighted voting process (via an application such as https://snapshot.org/ or https://coordinape.com/) to determine the final distribution coefficients.\n7. Any funds which the administrators conclude they are unable to disburse constructively (in accordance with Covenant) by 07/01/22 will be returned to DAO.\n8. The custodian of the proposing Noun (*wag#5265*) will recuse themselves from the round. \n9. Some additional context is currently available at: https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-pilot-coordinape-round-s-to-implement-retroactive-impact-rewards/929/5\n\n**Possible Failure Conditions**  \n1. Disagreements arise as to proper execution of Covenant, where clear consensus (measured as a simple majority vote) among Administrators cannot be reached.\n2. Number of nominated contributors is too low or too high to be deemed a useful representation of active Nouns builders.\n3. Unforeseen technical constraints make executing the weighted vote or disbursement impractical. \n\n**Possible Success Conditions** \n\ngood will and trust are Nounish ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó® ‚ùÑ\n![](https://i.imgur.com/w73OG8A.png)\n",

      "title": "SIP 00047: Improving Shark-Bait-Curation",
      "content": "## Problem statement\n\nShark Bait Curation was established and equipped with 20 ETH to:  \n\n1. Look for cc0/ nounish art/ projects to buy. Ideally buying from the artist directly to best support them.\n2. Work directly with artists to commission nounish/cc0 art. This art can be added to our treasury or distributed to sharkdao members.\n3. Creating editorial content around the art/ artists.\n\nYou can find the original proposal here:\n\n [https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth/proposal/Qmeq7bF84nuv2w7PoiuGP1WgT8vpuDSQpBQNrWcVy3TXHc](https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth/proposal/Qmeq7bF84nuv2w7PoiuGP1WgT8vpuDSQpBQNrWcVy3TXHc)\n\n- Due to a lack of structure and low engagement the process of collecting art goes slow and opportunities to buy amazing art pieces are missed.\n\n- Another problem is that our budget sits in the multisig and that we‚Äôre not able to buy stuff ourselves for that reason. This multisig-detour brings a lot of bureaucracy with it and is slowing down the whole curation process.\n\n## Suggested changes:\n\nWe suggest to modificate SIP-00031 as follows:\n\n- We already restructured the process of buying art with establishing a curation-core-group that votes on purchases and executes them. The current core group consists of:\n    \n    ‚Üí Cryptasha\n    \n    ‚Üí Joshua Fisher\n    \n    ‚Üí Sasquatch\n    \n    ‚Üí Ccarella\n    \n    ‚Üí Marxistmillionaire\n    3/5 votes are needed to make a decision. The open character of Shark-Bait    Curation (as mentioned in the original proposal) is preserved, and every Shark can still suggest something to buy. Establishing the curation-core-group has increased activity because the steps to buy a piece are clearer now and we want to keep it going this way. \nThis structural change needs to be approved now.    \n\n\n- The process of acquiring art would also be more efficient and less bureaucratic, if we‚Äôre able to buy stuff ourselves. We‚Äôre suggesting to set up a Prysm wallet with our curation budget for that reason. \nPrysm (https://www.prysm.xyz/) is a group ownership platform. Backed by Polychain and others, the team has built a simple interface that lets teams invest directly out of a multi signature wallet, a capability that we didn‚Äôt have before. The platform is built on top of the Gnosis SAFE protocol and integrates with other dApps like OpenSea or 0xProject to seamlessly facilitate on-chain transactions. Other DAOs like Friends with Benefits or GrailersDAO are using Prysm for similar purposes.\nWith Prysm, we are be able to propose acquisitions, vote on them and make the purchase with much less effort and bureaucracy than right now. The criteria for a single purchase stays the same as in the original proposal. All members of the core group are signers. 3/5 signatures are needed to take action. We‚Äôd like to move 5 ETH to Prysm right now. Further transactions of the curation budget need to be discussed between the multisig-signers and curation-core.\nThis change needs to be approved as well.\n    \n- According to the original proposal we‚Äôre obligated to buy directly from the artist/ creator. But sometimes a collection is already sold out or an artist is too big to do an exclusive collaboration with Shark DAO. We‚Äôd like to change the wording as follows:\n‚ÄúPurchases direct from the artist, if possible. When purchasing via secondary markets, overpaying and buying from flippers must be avoided.‚Äù   \n    \n\n## Cost:\n\n**Zero cost.** The 20 ETH budget has been allocated last october. 18,249 ETH are left.",

      "content": "This Snapshot is to put the below proposal on-chain and vote FOR:\n\nLet's create CC0 Story Bibles and Develop ideas that can be the foundation for future stories and inspire creatives to create their own stories, animations and Nouns content. \n\nWhen Blockbuster DAO recently proposed creating a Story Bible for Nouns there was hesitancy to fund the project for fear of establishing Canon. \n\nThrough a series of conversations with various Nouners there seems to be consensus that rather than fund only BBDAO we want to fund multiple groups to create great CC0 Story Bibles for anyone in the community build off of, fork, animate, draw, etc.\n\nI've spoken with BBDAO, Sam Ellis and StudioDAO who have all been following Nouns from the beginning, have great accomplishments and want to pursue this idea.\n\nWe will begin the process of creating Nounish characters, story explorations and series ideas that can lead to more and more diverse worlds built around Nouns. \n\nWe propose to create a Multi-Sig and start by funding 6 CC0 Story Bibles at ~20E each (120E total) all by accomplished writers. This seems to be a bit above industry standard but takes into consideration the CC0 requirement for this experiment.*\n\nCreative Teams (click names for more info)\n 1) [BBDAO 1 - Animated Series - Scott Albert & Will Bryan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dATW6a93NF5NelKz2PM3ap7HiOUWadFrOpcvmQurMao/edit)\n 2) [BBDAO 2 - Feature Film - Van Robichaux & Garfield Lindsay Miller](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dATW6a93NF5NelKz2PM3ap7HiOUWadFrOpcvmQurMao/edit) \n 3) [Sam Ellis - Animated Series](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yeSJcwZRSygWKAsRIJkQ2fMVY93Qcakax_YtOhOtTkU/edit?pli=1)\n 4) Studio DAO - Mixed Media Noun O'Clock Series\n 5) Greidiens / Keenan Thompson Group\n 6) TBD Group - will be sent back after 4 weeks if no group appears\n\nA story bible typically contains a cast of characters, some story ideas, maybe a season 1 arch and is delivered in a fully fleshed out document with drawings, text, etc. Some examples can be found below:\n\nExample Story Bibles:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/849745721544146955/921486884826406982/961336684505595995\n\nDeliverables: Based on this thread we expect each Bible to include a general world/universe outline, 15-20 Characters w/ illustrations and character descriptions, 10+ story/episode ideas. We expect these to be illustrated and 20+ pages each.\n\nThe multi-sig would pay the writers on a schedule of 30% Up Front, 20% Upon Rough Draft, 50% Upon Completion. For this first round we will be focused on writer/creator teams that have high level credits and a history of delivering professional works on time.\n\nMulti-Sig: address to be created post successful Snapshot\nSharkDAO Multi-Sig (5/7 signer wallet)\njoshuafisher.eth\n\nStory Foundation & Development Lead \nJawshua Fisher\nI‚Äôve been actively working with the teams, Nouners and Nouncil members on creating this proposal. I want to continue advising and consulting teams and basically providing an oversight over the whole project.\n\nMy goals for this project:\n- project oversights - payments, deliverables, DAO updates\n- advising and consulting the creative teams\n- active outreach to writers, animators and producers for consideration\n- phase 2 planning - reaching out to additional teams for production, illustration, animation, etc as well as exploring alternate ideas to create Story Foundations.\n\nI anticipate this project drives a lot interest and this comp will cover other activities that arise such as general Noun advice (I get a lot of questions and offer support for folks looking to get into Nouns or make proposals) and overall Noun Creative support/activity. For this I am proposing a compensation of 6ETH/month for trial period of 3 months.\n\nAs a creative manager by trade I have experience helping creatives deliver while holding them to high standards and helping with ideas. I've also been here paying close attention since Noun 3 and feel I have a good foundation for many of the fun moments and underlying themes that have been embraced. Finally, I'm a multi-sig signer at SharkDAO and am active in the community. \n\nLegal Fees \nI don‚Äôt have a legal quote but think we could create a simmple agreement with writers with a great lawyer for 10E or less, the high cost is due to uncertainty about DAO, CC0, etc. We will send back any unused funds. Will also use this fund for reimbursing the set up of the multi-sig.\n\nTotal Funding - 148E to Multi-Sig\nCreative Teams - 120E\nDAO Oversight - 18E \nLegal Fees - 10E\n\n*To be clear if a great creator with passion shows up and wants to participate we would condsider them in this group or could support through Small Grants or other mechanisms, we want all creators of all levels to work on Nouns including potentially non-CC0 interpretations.",

      "title": "Funding Comms 2.0",
      "content": "\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe comms team was funded with an initial budget for three months. Now the term has ended, but we want to continue our work and implement some improvements.  \n\n## Summary\n\nA team of DAO members will contribute towards a regular cadence of \narticles, social media posts, and otherwise public-facing content from \nSharkDAO to build brand awareness and proliferate our DAO across web3. \n\nThe comms-team has executed or helped executing the following tasks during the last round of funding:\n‚Üí Shipping Sharkmas in december (giveaways, juicebox reopening, alpha degen contest). \n‚Üí Shark Street Comic Chapter 1 (published), and Chapter 2 (work in progress).  \n‚Üí Inventing the Shark DAO Podcast.\n ‚Üí Bridging the gap between curation and comms by doing \ncuration-announcements/ twitter-posts, and editorial content. \nRestructuring shark-bait-curation so that curation efforts will help\n more to proliferate our DAO across Web3. \n‚Üí  Creating visual content (banners, invitations e.g.) for Discord and Twitter.\n‚Üí The Discord- and Notion-workflow has been improved.\n‚Üí Main Twitter activities (daily posts, hosting Twitter spaces, interacting with other projects/ representing the DAO). \n‚Üí KPI analysis\n\nAs you can see: We were building a lot. But we also think that the first proposal lacked with assigning responsibilities/ leadership. And it wasn‚Äôt clear which tasks are compensated via Coordinape and which with the proposal budget. Funding comms wasn‚Äôt completely effective because of that and we‚Äôd like to implement some improvements to fix these issues.  \n\nThe open character of the comms team has to be preserved, but we also would like to structure it more efficiently. The Coordinape round didn‚Äôt work well and we suggest to replace it with regular salaries for steady contributors and with paying bounties for specific tasks.  \n\n\n\n\n# Details\n\n## Comms Core Team\n\nThe Comms Core Team is reduced from seven to four people. It will consist of Cryptasha, Catriona Emily, Maty and Marxistmillionaire. The core group is executing different tasks, that proliferate our DAO across web 3.  All members get a three month contract. They execute the following tasks: \n\n**Cryptasha:**\n\n- Lead on the official SharkDAO twitter account.\n- Multiple daily posts.\n- Execution on the Twitter strategy in accordance with individual teams in SharkDAO.\n- Execution of posting in other social channels in coordination with the Comms Team.\n- Monthly KPI reporting/analytics added to Notion\n- Add inquiries from Twitter to Inbound Comms Opportunities\n- Check in with newly created, ‚ÄúSharkDAO Marketing, Media, and Comm‚Äù thread and adjust SM to align with plans.\n- Focus mainly on Shark Island project when it is released by following the marketing plan that is decided.\n- Available for other projects and ideas within the DAO as well.\n\n**Marxistmillionaire:**\n\n- Shark Bait Curation artist interviews and articles about nounish, cc0-projects, or different aspects of cc0-art. Two articles a month (published on Mirror) are expected.\n- Creating Noun-Personalities-Content, that will be published via the main twitter account. The Personalities-Accounts lack followership and it‚Äôs confusing to have different twitter accounts for one organisation.  At least one personalities post per week is expected.\n- Marxist will keep track of the comms budget. He‚Äôs also willing to fullfill more administraive duties if necessary.\n- Copy editing / writing support on SharkDAO releases.\n\n**Maty:**\n\n- In-House Graphic Designer.\n- Twitter-banners, memes, visual content in general.\n- Graphic design of editorials.\n\n**Catriona Emily:**\n\n- Certain comms-core-responsibilities overlap with Emily‚Äôs job as a community manager (in-community-communication, growth potential e.g.). She‚Äôs a part of comms core to discuss possible improvements and to implement the suggested changes.\n\n## Bounties\n\n- A specific amount is reserved to compensate sporadic contributors. Members of the core group won‚Äôt get bounties.\n- These contributors can pitch and execute projects that build brand awareness and proliferate our DAO across web3.\n- The core group can pay bounties as an incentive to get tasks done they can not perform themselfes (marketing for certain projects, 3d graphics, twitter hacks e.g.).\n- Sharks that haven‚Äôt been compensated for their previous comms work can get a retroactive bounty for their tasks. But members of comms-core won‚Äôt get retroactive bounties.\n- The core group is responsible for doing market research about what amount is appropriate for which task.\n- Bounties must be approved by 3/4 members of the Comms Core Team.\n- Comms Core is responsible for administration. For paying bounties we suggest to create a sub-multisig with the comms-core-members as signers. We can pay contributors faster that way and don‚Äôt have to bug the main-multisig with our transactions.\n\n\n# Budget:\n\n## Wrapping up the old budget\n\n- The Coordinape round didn‚Äôt go well because some participants didn‚Äôt execute tasks and others were compensated with proposal budget as well. We suggest to cancel the Coordinape round and transfer the funds (5 ETH) into the prospective comms budget.\n- 3.895 ETH are left from the proposal budget. These funds are transfered into the prospective budget as well.\n\n## Compensating Comms Core:\n\n- We are asking for 10 ETH, distributed as follows:\n        - 4 ETH allocated to Cryptasha for a 3 month contract\n        - 3 ETH allocated to Marxistmillionaire for a 3 month contract.\n        - 3 ETH allocated to Maty for a 3 month contract.\n        - 0 ETH allocated to Emily. Her salary is covered by the Community     Management Proposal.\n   \n## Bounties:     \n- 5 ETH are allocated for compensating sporadic contributors with bounties for specific tasks.\n    \n## Budget Details:\n- Total budget is 15 ETH. But 8.895 ETH are left from our previous budget, so we‚Äôre asking for **6.105 ETH** from the treasury.\n- Expectations to be responsible with the delegated budget, actively\npursue new SharkDAO communicative strategies or brand initiatives.\n- All members commit themselfes to report about the outreach of their projects (KPI reporting).\n- Contracts start on an agreed date between the contributors and the SharkDAO multi-sig.\n    - Paid across three monthly transactions or in another method as chosen by the multi-sig.\n    \n\n# Risks\n\n- The changes are making things even worse.\n- Treasury funds are spent ineffectively.",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 62",
      "content": "# Prop House Continuation\n\n**tl;dr:**\nProp House has shown promise as an alternative funding mechanism for the DAO via it‚Äôs web app and ETH<>Proposal auction format. I‚Äôm requesting 214 ETH (120 funding props / 94 opex) to continue to explore the Prop House model as a way to scale capital deployment over the next 4 months. \n\n### What has  happened since [Prop 23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23):\n- Built [prop.house](https://prop.house) \n- Funded 9 proposals for a total of 15 ETH\n- Received 69 proposals over two funding rounds (third round kicked off 4/13)\n- Opened dialogue with extension communities to onboard into Prop House, holding conversations with leaders and community members to understand their footing.\n- Gained 1,000+ followers on the Prop House twitter account\n- [Expense report](https://airtable.com/shr5UPKk4jyhveIDd)\n\n### Reflections:\n\n**Quality proposals**\nThe two core hypotheses with initial testing were that 1) there would be a meaningful volume of proposals given the ETH<>Proposal auction format and 2) some subset of proposals would be high quality. With 69 proposals and a double digit % of those being highly desirable, I feel confident that we should continue to pursue scale via the prop house model.\n\n**Communities are eager to participate**\nWith a total of 48 proposals and 520 votes casted by 77 non-nouners for Round 1, it‚Äôs clear that members of the broader community, both individually and as part of extension communities, are eager to participate. It‚Äôs behavior like this that points to how NFT communities can grow beyond their ownership-constrained communities (particularly true for Nouns).\n\n**DAO-only voting won't scale**\nGiven the volume of proposals received in Funding Round 1, it's clear that a Prop House where only Nouners are voting won't enable us to scale to 1000s of proposals. i.e. It's irrational to expect Nouners to be reading through 50 proposals every week. If we are to hit scale, decision making needs to be gradually decentralized. \n\n### Beyond funding - a new way to interact:\nFraming the ERC721 standard as the social graph, Prop House may be looked at as a ‚Äúpermissionless ETH power source that communities gather around‚Äù (h/t joel).\n\nAnalogous to reddit, we now have crypto-native subreddits but are missing the key ingredient that makes crypto so special - the ability to transact, transform and create value. \n\n**With this proposal**, Prop House looks to do two things:\n1) Focus development on the Nouns Prop House as the main node in the network:\n    - Nail down UX \n    - Experiment with different funding amounts, longer and shorter rounds \n3) Explore the ways in which the DAO can further its reach via independent Prop Houses (e.g. prop.house/**japan**, /**extensions**, /**budlight**)\n    - Enable these communities to become self-curating Prop Houses where their members both submit and vote on their own proposals.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kQ1JnVC.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/le4Q4Xz.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ElCNZge.png)\n\n\n### Team:\n- seneca (all hats)\n- devcarrot (backend)\n- toastee (design)\n- cdt (frontend)\n- jckbutcher (memes)\n\n### Budget:\n\nWe are requesting working + funding capital for **4 months** of operations. \n\n- Funding props, 120 ETH:\n    - 80 ETH for Nouns Prop House\n    - 40 ETH for 1-3 Nouns extensions Prop Houses (e.g. japan, nounpunks, budlight)\n- Operational, 94 ETH:\n    - 23.5 ETH per month:\n        - 10 ETH seneca \n        - 3.5 ETH devcarrot\n        - 3.5 ETH toastee\n        - 3.5 ETH jckbutcher\n        - 3 ETH for other potential misc expenses \n\n**Considerations**\n- Funding schedule is meant to be flexible so that we can both experiment (diff funding amounts) and slowly ramp up (i.e. start with 1 extension prop house)\n- Funding amounts and corresponding communities will be decided internally by the Prop House team. Some of the heuristics we are using to select communities:\n    - Enough activity to merit competition between proposals\n    - Willingness to onboard from leadership\n    - Alignment with nounish culture and proliferation\n- The ideal and final version of Prop House would allow for all decisions with regards to funds leaving the DAO to be decided upon by Nouners via vote. \n\n**Multi-sig**\nThe [multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5BcD6f3B0a5519D448FBDf33204091bbE097C992) is currently 2/3 where the signers are seneca, devcarrot and toastee. It still holds ~20 ETH from [prop 23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23). With the passing of this proposal, we will be adding 2 more signers (cdt and jckbutcher). The addresses are as follows:\n- safe: 0x5BcD6f3B0a5519D448FBDf33204091bbE097C992\n- seneca: 0xfC9e8dB5E255439F430e058462360Dd52b87cB4f\n- devcarrot: 0xB1C41C71d36cedEa7DdCd5f8D5c5C32BA8f3CBFc\n- toastee: 0x5F99FC2d2A98e046t9689d3117e0F96bb5c640d88\n- cdt: 0xD19BF5F0B785c6f1F6228C72A8A31C9f383a49c4\n- jckbutcher: 0xD1295FcBAf56BF1a6DFF3e1DF7e437f987f6feCa\n\n\n### Closing thoughts\nProp 23 enabled the first experiment of the Prop House model. Given the results, it seems to me that the answer to \"is there something here?\" was a resounding yes. Moving forward, I hope to continue to build with the same framing: an exploration to see what the model can amount to.\n\nFor this next phase, there are a few key questions that I'd like to have more definitive answers to, chief among them: \n- Is the volume of quality proposals meaningful?\n- Will funding align extension/external communities to proliferate Nouns? \n- Is the Prop House model a viable approach to pursue 100x growth? \n\nThe goal of this proposal is to answer these questions by continuing to develop the UX while taking our first steps towards independent Prop Houses.\n\nIf this second phase succceeds, I intend to eventually  develop Prop House into an trustless on-chain solution. As stated in [Prop 23](https://nouns.wtf/vote/23):\n> Conceptually, the contracts could be the seed to a crypto native Y Combinator model. Where as before you had partners, now you have DAO members. Instead of summer and winter batches, you have weekly or monthly cadences. And instead of demographic restrictions for applicants, you have anyone with an Ethereum wallet. It might be the case that breaking thresholds in the categories mentioned above transforms the model to something completely different.\n\nFrom lessons learned in the first phase, I'd reframe it by saying that utilizing only DAO members won't scale. Instead, plugging into open and available social graphs (ERC721) is the way.",

      "content": "# Residency for cdt.eth\n\nHey all, my name is Christian. Through this proposal I will be able to dedicate myself full-time to Nouns as opposed to when I can fit it in after my day job & other responsibilities.\n\n**What I‚Äôve worked on for Nouns**\n- Currently building Nouns Center, a [community site](https://nouns.center/) for Nouns projects & tools\n- Co-developed Lost Nouns, an [extension](https://lostnouns.wtf/) project with unused assets\n- Host & produce Noun O‚Äô Talk, a [podcast](https://pod.link/1615472873) interviewing Noun owners & builders\n- Worked on [Nouns proposal #9](https://nounspoap.com/) for creating POAPs for daily auctions\n- Created [SharkDAO‚Äôs](https://sharks.wtf/) (Nouns sub-dao) website\n- Founding [Nouncil](https://nouncil.wtf/gov) member\n\n![final](https://i.imgur.com/fNOPFAh.jpg)\n \n**What I will do during my residency**\n\n**1. Nouns Center -** I have incredibly high hopes for this project and a big feature list that is ever-growing. Capturing the entirety of our community‚Äôs data in one place is no small feat but has already proven to be useful. Seeing it being linked to answer questions is gratifying. I want every piece of Nouns info to be a link away and I want to empower devs and artists to build off Nouns. I will continue to hold ‚Äúoffice hours‚Äù and be as transparent as possible with my progress.\n\n**2. Noun O‚Äô Talk -** A passion project in the truest sense. We‚Äôve had 27 guests on over 9 episodes from extension builders to board members to DAO members and even Bud Light. I aim to keep these conversations interesting and informative, and I have a ton of other folks lined up and would love to keep working on this. I‚Äôd like to add a theme song and edit the audio while continually hosting these live on a weekly basis and then publishing to all podcast platforms.\n\n**3. Prop House -** I plan on coming aboard and helping out with the frontend, developing v2, and solidifying it‚Äôs place as a great tool in our ecosystem.\n\n**Funds requested**\n\n$175K* paid over 6 months in USDC which equates to roughly 8.5E/month by todays valuation.\n\n*the equivalent of $190k `(to absorb potential volatility in ETH from time period between submission and execution)` would¬†¬†would be sent to a multisg managed by trusted members of the community (9999, Seneca, and Toastee), they would then convert $175k worth of ETH to USDC, set up the stream and then send back the remaining ETH to the DAO.\n\nThe safe to handle cdt's transaction was created at 0xb809f32CfE33F3CcA0bbfdf8f56041c081138bb3:\n\n**Signers**\n- toastee: 0x353224270c2C9a7eCcE7d8dBA98a61587da6F50a\n- 9999: 0x6223Bc5fd16a19bcFAe2281dDE47861CFE1023eE\n- seneca: 0xfC9e8dB5E255439F430e058462360Dd52b87cB4f\n\n**Recipient**\ncdt's address: 0x1Bf87eAd2Fc2A4751CF5Bda011E5Afa320391cc2",

      "content": "# Gamify fundraising for Ukraine by donating 51 ETH through the Rescue Toadz project\n\n\n## Summary\nThe goal is to donate 51 ETH for humanitarian aid to Ukraine and increase the popularity of the Rescue Toadz (https://rescuetoadz.xyz/) charity project so that more people start donating as well.\n\n## Methodology\nRescue Toadz is a charity project that gamifies the fundraising process. It is an NFT collection of 18 toadz with 100% of the funds being donated to Ukraine via Unchain Ukraine. A special bidding mechanic encourages people to donate more.\n\nThe gamified aspect is that you can not only mint toadz, but also transfer someone else‚Äôs toad in your wallet by matching or increasing their last donation. The toad then drops its noun glasses as POAP in the wallet of the original holder.\n\nThis mechanism is coded directly in the smart contract and a toad owner cannot prevent the toad from hopping into another wallet. This encourages people to donate more - if they want to keep their toad they need to increase the price of the donation or acquire back the toad if somebody donated more.\n\n100% of the funds are immediately sent from the Rescue Toadz smart contract to Unchain Ukraine. It is a pure charity project - the project devs make no money from it.\n\n## Why not donate directly to Unchain?\nThe idea is not only for Nouns DAO to donate, but also to encourage other people to donate as well. For example, NounsDAO will donate for already minted toadz and ‚Äústeal‚Äù them from the previous owners. Some of them will then donate again to get their toad back.\n\nThe goal of the proposal is to donate 0.2 ETH for 5 toadz that are already minted and ‚Äústeal‚Äù them from the previous owners and also raise the prices for two other toadz to 10 ETH and 40 ETH respectively.\n\n## Conclusion\nDonating 51 ETH through the Rescue Toadz project has the following benefits:\n\nFunds raised by NounsDAO to help Ukrainian people recover from the war\nRaised popularity of the Rescue Toadz charity project, so more people start donating\nPeople that had their Rescue Toad taken from them are incentivized to get it back by donating again.\nRecue Toadz or Noun Glasses NFTs collected by the NounsDAO\nRaised popularity of the iconic Nouns Glasses, which are dropped as POAP for everybody that participated",

This proposal is to fund the initial run and launch of the physical and NFT components of this project. More details here: https://ivory-pine-ebc.notion.site/NounsDAO-Proposal-29a658f763f74f958f7c6bd916533dbb.\n\n## Upcoming plan\n\nWe‚Äôre planning to launch these as an NFT collection of limited-edition glasses. Each NFT is *consumable* in the sense that it can be used *once* to redeem a physical pair. Once the NFT is used, a boolean value is flipped to indicate consumed status and the underlying tokenURI is permanently changed. A physical pair of sunglasses is then sent to you.\n\n**~7.2% of supply reserved for NounsDAO Treasury**\n\nThe total supply of the collection will be 6969 units. This project would not have been possible without the NounsDAO and the treasury.  As a thank you, we‚Äôve decided to allocate ~7.2% of the supply to the treasury (500 units). We hope to make other such contributions as a thank you to the DAO in the future. \n\n**Custom Edition Glasses Just For Noun holders**\n\nWe‚Äôre also making a custom ‚Äúspecial edition‚Äù pair *exclusively* for noun owners. The design of these glasses will be based off of the under-appreciated and rare ‚Äúdisco‚Äù glasses featured on some nouns. *There will only 500 of these glasses ever made, and will be available to the first 500 nouns during mint. This means, future nouns (up to #500) will also be able to receive the glasses.*\n\n## *High-level todos that still remain*\n\n- **Create Smart Contract, Website, Minting, and Redeeming Experience.**\n    - Have had a preliminary call with @blequity at Zora and will be using Zora‚Äôs smart contract system to launch this NFT.\n    - Both Signora Armati and I are software engineers so will be able to build most of this ‚Äîbut we may hire 1 or 2 engineers to accelerate the timeline.\n- **Finalize a storage/distribution facility for shipping the sunglasses.**\n    - We‚Äôll need to organize a distribution facility which will serve a few functions:\n        - Long-term storage of glasses (for those that are unredeemed or redeemed later)\n        - We have items coming from multiple manufacturers (Sunglasses, Nouns Box, Carrying case, polishing cloth, thank you cards) ‚Äî and will need an area to assemble and ship out all boxes.\n- **Promotional Video / Ad**\n    - We want to create a fun promo (IRL) video that showcases the glasses + nouns brand. We‚Äôve had a preliminary call with [@jasonmorena_](https://twitter.com/jasonmorena_) (who was previously the filmmaker for Gary Vee) who has expressed interest in creating an ad for us.\n- **Finalize glass design and create units at scale.** \n\n### **Funds Requested**\n\n- 115Œû for creating the smart contract, website, promotional/marketing material (this will be most of the remaining work), distribution facility, and to start manufacturing.\n- 1 Noun of the DAO's choice upon successful delivery of the first physical pair of glasses.\n",

      "content": "# FUN Noggles Stage 2\n\n### SharkDAO is looking to create a multi-sig wallet w/ Big Shot Toyworks and requesting 50E from NounsDAO to fund... \n\nFUNctional Nounish Glasses by Bigshot Toyworks:\nhttps://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-funglasses-sage-2-tooling-molds/927\n\nGoogle Doc link w/ pics (text below): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ESzii8-OVRPkqLGOvZQ0dxfwCvLJ7tt1Q_iakSI8fMU/edit?usp=sharing\n \n\n## STAGE 2 (MANUFACTURING)\n\nPrototype samples are ready. Now we need to start tooling and factory prep for production:\n\n2A: Tooling \nDevelopment and production of high quality precision steel molds for the mass manufacturing process.\n \nSample molds produced by Bigshot in similar materials\n\nInjection molds- ABS and PC (Polycarbonate), plus packaging design/layout, packaging dies & blister tray molds: \nCost estimate: $25-32K (10 ETH equivalent) \nAbove includes: Paint molds, tampo molds for keychain and any QR codes. Any kind of debugging and pilot run to test viability and revisions. \n\nNotes on tooling: tooling is a one-time charge, unless we need to increase bulk production to meet demand and make X more molds etc. Molds will be stored for reuse as needed.\n\n\n\n\nDeluxe gift box packaging, Satin finish with Spot UV, High gloss printing, Blister tray packaging packed in individual shippers for easy distribution. 5 ps per carton, and 4 cartons to master carton. Notes on package design: The package concept has space on it to showcase approximately 20+ nouns characters. We can chose the most Nounish or pleasing pieces that work in the layout (would love a list and images ASAP if community wants to weigh in)\n\n\n2B: Production\nCost estimate $13-17 USD per unit packaged as a final product\nSRP: $20-22 wholesale, $40-45 retail \n\nThe goal of these is to distribute as many as possible so these can be allocated as giveaways to shows and events or sold at a wholesale price giving the event an opportunity to make money.\n\nSample first order breakdown:\n\n5000 pcs Incl. 500 GOLD NOUNDER GIFTS:\n3000 red \n1000 blue \n500 TBD (Pink ???)\n500 BLACK \n500 CHROME GOLD -exclusive to NOUN holders and only available through our gated shop\n\nIF Noun Holders want one of each  of any exclusives we need to consider additional orders\n\nBest to make first order as large as possible to cover any events during the next 6 months to 1 year \n\nImportant to consider the Nounish community needs for these Funglasses in the initial order so that there is enough stock on hand to satisfy any and all proposed promotional efforts.\n \n2C: Logistics and shipping\n \nAir shipping for samples and any show exclusives\nSea shipping for mass production\nAll items shipped to our 3PL warehouse in the USA for warehousing & fulfillment.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, Bigshot will act as a custodian for the physical glasses products and continue to develop new colors and possible tie-ins with other brands.\n\n\n\n\n\n2D: Maintaining stock & availability in USA\n\nBigshot will maintain a public-facing web shop with stock. We will make quantities of glasses available to Nouns at the discretion of the DAO for events and promotions and any other purpose. Will allocate specified quantities to Noun holders through our gated web store at no cost.\n\nShould there be event planning for future activities where we would need to manufacture exclusive products in special colors or packaging, or larger quantities, we need about 4-6 months notice at least. Air shipping is always available to expedite delivery but that is much more expensive than slow sea shipping.\n\nNeed to create web content for any scans of QR codes or Box scans to launch interactive elements like 3D AR Nouns or animated 3D Nouns.\n \nNounish community benefit: each Noun holder or friend /family could claim 5 free sets of glasses + shipping and handling worldwide (for example). If there are 300 Noun holders, and each holder gets 5 free glasses, then we need to plan for US stock to be depleted by 1500 units right away.\n\nThe rest of the stock will be available in the shop at a $40 USD retail but allocated to the various events and promotions as needed at a wholesale of $20 each. \n\n\n\n\n\n2E: Sundries associated with creating and selling physical goods\n\nWe would need to purchase LIABILITY INSURANCE\nCost estimate: $6-8K per year (or ETH equivalent)\n\nIn all instances, when paying for physical goods projects in ETH, we need to address the volatility of ETH. We would need to convert all ETH payments into fiat immediately in order to pay vendors like factories, warehouse, logistics companies etc.\n\nSuggestion to establish quarterly payment to maintain all of the parts moving.  Warehouse, logistics/production manager etc\n\n2F: Global Community Engagement Strategies\n\nPromoting Noun glasses & increasing visibility of the brand. Some of our ideas include:\n\nToy & pop culture conventions around the world (UK toycon/DCON, TTS, Wonder festival Design Fiesta, Shanghai toy show, beijing toy show etc)\nNFT-related meetups & events\nSports events Pro and college level - Funglasses giveaways at stadiums\nPromotional tie-ins e.g. Bud Light? \nCommercial use / brand use of the products Custom glasses frames with unique packaging similar to Bearbricks\nArt shows and events like a space at ART Basel (wynwood walls or SCOPE) , a DesignerCon takeover, a booth at NYCC, etc\nActive social media placements through targeted giveaways and event appearances documented on social media \nDCON TAKEOVER (NOUN-A-PALOOZA) with a 20x30 or larger booth experience with DJs, live art and activities  (papercraft, coloring books. DIY glasses projects etc) - featuring all of the current & upcoming Nounish projects sponsored by the DAO presented as a case study for what is possible with Nouns and more.\n5000 sets of glasses insert into the VIP bags at Dcon\nA NOUNTOWN in a metaverse, a place to hold events, art shows etc. DECENTRALLAND or?\nWe could use Funglasses in an onboarding package for new community members, both Nouners and newbs. - can have QR codes to easily disseminate info about the Nouns community and what is available to community members - answering the questions who, what and why?\nInfluencer mailers\n\n\nTiming of New Production Projects:\nAny Funglasses needs / events that the community decides upon that would overrun our available inventory in the USA warehouse would have to be communicated to us within a timeframe that allows us to quote on, produce and ship the required goods. Both air and sea shipping are extremely expensive these days, so a lot of advance planning is required for bigger production projects (ideally 4 months advance notice, can be cut to 3 months if we do air shipping).\nCost estimate: TBD\n\nOne way to avoid long production delays is to initially produce an overage of thousands of pairs of glasses in the main colors and store them in our USA warehouse so we have an abundance of stock to ship out as needed.\n\nWarehousing extra units has a cost - our warehousing partner charges by square foot. So we would need to estimate monthly cost of keeping the inventory based on how many units we keep on hand and how long we intend to store them.\nCost estimate: TBD\n\n\n\n\nDue to fluctuating ETH value and the fact that we need to immediately convert ETH into fiat to send to factory, we need to calculate each of the above payments right before it is due.\n\n \nLETS GO!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF COSTS:\n\nOVERALL FUNGLASSES ESTIMATED PROJECT COSTS\n(not including marketing / community engagement)\n\nTooling: 10 ETH *Note Small Grants is giving 5E to get this going now\nProduction @ 5K units: 26 ETH\nShipping / logistics estimate: 5 ETH\nWarehousing for 1 year: 4 ETH\nLiability insurance for 1 year: 3 ETH\n\nTOTAL ESTIMATE: 48-55 ETH (approx 0.01 ETH per unit)\n\nExpenses for a 2nd order would be lower per unit due to the elimination of the one time costs.\nSIMPLE PAYMENT BREAKDOWN:\n\nSharkDAO & Bigshot Multi-Sig -    0x6C3A3374f1250597431d4ead59C35FBadf132b40\n\n#1 tooling payment due ASAP to begin - 10 ETH (project is ready to go - there is a 35-45 day process between initial payment to test shots stage)\n#2 - 30 days later - production deposit payment 50% of whatever production ends up being\n(There may be minimal fluctuations in costs due to the deluxe packaging) \n#3 - 45 days  later - final balance production due\n#4 - 30 days later logistics - costs determined at time of payment due\n\nStill trying to figure out the final cost/process etc on the small details as it is pretty involved and needs to be developed for this and future projects. \n\n",

      "content": "# Contribute 6.9E to funding Calladita film\n\nPutting this proposal on-chain in collaboration with Miguel Faus\n\n# [Calladita Film](https://www.calladitafilm.com/)\n\nFirst European (and second ever) fiction movie funded with NFTs, based on an award-winning short film with an A-list cast attached.\n\n[**2-minute Intro Video on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/miguelfaus/status/1500867988341280771?s=20&t=7jVlhyOdDeGSoR8Wg9BoDg)\n\n[![Calladita](https://i.ibb.co/z4f3grt/calladita1.png)](https://www.calladitafilm.com/)\n\n\n## About the Film\n*The movie will be shot in Barcelona (Spain) in September, and is **expected to premiere in International Festivals in spring 2023**, and then in cinemas (there‚Äôs distribution agreements in place with Spanish and U.S. distributors) and finally in streaming platforms.*\n*We want this historic web3 movie to have several easter eggs of NFT and Web3 Culture, and the Nouns embody decentralization and CC0 like no other project, so we would love to find ways to showcase Nouns in the film.*\n\n*The entirety of the proceeds from the NFT collection will go towards the budget of the film: locations, equipment rentals, cast & crew, travel & accommodation, post-production‚Ä¶, and so I would like to propose that the DAO contributes to the budget of the film, and in exchange we contribute to ‚Äúproliferating Nouns‚Äù by showing them in this pioneering web3 film.*\n*We believe that ‚ÄúCalladita‚Äù has the potential of starting a movement towards the decentralization of cinema via web3, because film is still the most centralized and corporation-controlled art form around.*\n\n## Nouns in Calladita\nNouns will be included in the movie as follows:\n1.    A Character in the film will wear Nouns Glasses in at least 1 scene.\n2.    There will be a chosen Noun put as decoration on the location of the film, which will appear in at least 1 scene. \n3.    Credits: either the Nouns glasses or one chosen Noun will appear in the Credits of the film, and NounsDAO will appear credited as an ‚ÄúAssociate Producer‚Äù of the movie.\n\n## Funding Request\nThe total budget of the film is 1.4M$, so we‚Äôre looking to raise that amount through our NFT collection. We would ask for a **contribution of 6.9 ETH** from Nouns DAO for this collaboration.\n\nTransaction Details:\n```\ntx1: 6.9E to calladita.eth (contribution)\ntx2: 0.25E to apenoun.eth (oversight & coordination)\n```\n\n",

We secured our first signing, [Joe Atkinson](https://www.instagram.com/joeatkinsons), who is currently working on his first Nounish production.\n\nThis proposal aims to facilitate a co-op between [Nouns Athletes](https://twitter.com/nounsathletes) and [Gnars](https://gnars.wtf), a community of action sports enthusiasts ready to expand beyond skateboarding, to all extreme sports.\n\n**Gnars DAO** is a natural progression for a project that‚Äôs well positioned to help extreme athletes reach the people, places and things that bring out their best ‚Äì ultimately proliferating Nouns.\n\n## TL;DR\n\n**Extreme sports DAO tasked with‚Ä¶**\n\n1. Managing a Nouns DAO funded and decentralised treasury\n2. Sponsoring athletes with grants for travel and content creation\n3. Making production, merch, event and protocol decisions\n\n**Requesting 69 ETH** for Gnars DAO to steward an expansion of Nouns Athletes with travel sponsorships across various target disciplines.\n\nie. Gnars DAO (enthusiasts) proliferating Nouns DAO (professionals)...\n\n## Sub-DAOs\n\nNouns DAO inherently [faces a number of challenges](https://twitter.com/0xigami/status/1511601988915523585) around ideation and capital deployment, due to the broadness of application that comes with such an ambitious project.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/336a6169a8e534d0e5a38077c5ea7b24a1cfc1d2_2_690x357.png)\n\nAs of 22 March 2022, Nouns DAO has:\n* Received 23,421 ETH\n* Sent 4,784 ETH\n    * Staked 3,000 in Lido\n    * Spent 458 on Foundation setup and ops\n\n**Only 1,326 ETH has been spent on directly proliferating Nouns,** which represents **just 5.66% of total funding raised,** most of which is not visible on the chart above.\n\nSub-DAOs may address the deal flow problems faced by a generalist organisation such as Nouns, by operating as an intermediary for impactful and domain specific capital deployment.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/192fa943b3337ed1990092839abbdadd1b181009_2_690x288.png)\n\nGnars began as a simple experiment to see how people value team contributions versus allocation of funds toward meaningful and well aligned charitable causes. As expected, collectors want to see what the future holds and therefore tend toward adequately funding a team ‚Äì tested using a [Humble Bundle inspired](https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/204387088-Pay-What-You-Want-and-Contribution-Sliders) contribution slider.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/3e838186abf3c575e92ffe393b44445d749b2258_2_690x239.png)\n\nBut perhaps more abstractly, the project was intended to serve as a dip of the toe, to understand whether I personally, should ‚ÄúSkate or DAO?‚Äù Having quickly attracted a community of talented and passionate individuals, I‚Äôve discovered that the answer is unequivocally ‚ÄúDAO.‚Äù\n\nConnecting with the community has helped me to understand that we are uniquely positioned for experimentation. As a laser focused sub-DAO we can recruit and grow an extreme sports team through fan engagement. \n\nI‚Äôm proposing a domain specific sub-DAO structure **‚Äì a *SHRED*.**\n\n## Gnars DAO\n\nSkate or DAO -> Shred the Nouns ü§ò\n\nGnars aims to operate as a ***Streamlined Hierarchical Really Excellent DAO (SHRED)*** and while the name is a stretch, the concept of ‚Äòshredding the nouns‚Äô can be hyper-focused and impactful.\n\nThe structure allows for off-chain voting with on-chain execution, without dependence on a single centralised entity. This hybrid model is more accessible since individual voters won‚Äôt need to pay gas. But it‚Äôs also an adequately secure means of sub-DAO treasury stewardship.\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/b74c48999630dffa607bfd7cbc72f059732d72ee_2_690x238.png)\n\n[Zodiac Reality Module](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/docs/tutorial-module-reality/get-started/) ([I've deployed here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xca553AC295EDA95594e77Aa97525Fc815090589a)) enables on-chain execution based on the outcome of events reported by the reality.eth oracle.

Making production, merch, event and protocol decisions\n\n**Requesting 69 ETH** to establish a Gnars DAO fund, stewarding an expansion of Nouns Athletes with travel sponsorships for action sports professionals, across eight (or more) target disciplines.\n\n**FISE World Series late May,** where Nouns Athlete, Joe Atkinson, will be competing for his 4th inline skating title, presents potential to sponsor (subject to change) a:\n\n* BMX rider\n* Climber\n* Mountain bike rider\n* Parkour free-runner\n* Scooter rider\n* Skateboarder\n* Wakeboarder\n\n**Approximate budget of...**\n\n* Annual $25k USD per athlete (contest/filming travels) \n* Equating to $200k or the majority of 69 ETH grant \n* Approx $225k at current ETH price\n\n**Finally, there is also the option to sponsor fewer athletes** at a higher amount, for example *five athletes at $40k each* (lots of demand for supporting winter sports).\n\nThank you everynoun for taking the time to peruse this proposal and if I have your support I look forward to receiving your vote.\n\nShred the Nouns ü§ò\n\n[Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami) ‚åê‚ó®-‚ó®\n\n*See you at NFT.NYC where I‚Äôll be Noun and Proud handing out Noun 189 fingerboards with Gnar griptape.

      "content": "#  Donate 51 ETH for humanitarian aid to Ukraine through the Rescue Toadz project\n\n## Summary\nDonate 51 ETH for humanitarian aid to Ukraine through the Rescue Toadz (https://rescuetoadz.xyz/) project and incentivize people to donate more.\n\n## Methodology\nRescue Toadz is an NFT collection of 18 toadz in which 100% of the funds are donated to Ukraine via Unchain Ukraine (directly coded in the smart contract). The project has a special bidding mechanic that encourages people to donate more.\n\nThe interesting thing is that you can not only mint toadz, but also match or increase the last donation for an already minted toad and it will automatically be transferred into your wallet. The toad will then drop its noun glasses as POAP in the wallet of the original holder.\n\nThis mechanism is coded directly in the smart contract and a toad owner cannot prevent the toad from hopping into another wallet. The idea is that this will encourage people to donate more. If they want to keep their toad they need to increase the price of the donation or acquire back the toad if somebody donated more.\n\n### Why not donate directly to Unchain?\n\nThe idea is to gamify the donation experience so people will donate more. For example, NounsDAO can donate for already minted toadz and ‚Äústeal‚Äù them from the previous owners. Some of them will then donate again to get their toad back.\n\nThe goal of the proposal is to donate 0.2 ETH for 5 toadz that are already minted and ‚Äústeal‚Äù them from the previous owners and also raise the prices for two other toadz to 10 ETH and 40 ETH respectively.\n\n### Transactions\n\nThe following transactions shall be executed if the proposal is approved:\n\nDonate 5x 0.2 ETH for Rescue Toadz #2, #5, #6, #11 and #16\nDonate 10 ETH for Rescue Toad #15\nDonate 40 ETH for Rescue Toad #8\n\n## Conclusion\nDonating 51 ETH through the Rescue Toadz project has the following benefits:\n\nFunds raised by NounsDAO to help Ukrainian people recover from the war\nRaised popularity of the Rescue Toadz charity project, so more people start donating\nPeople that had their Rescue Toad taken from them are incentivized to get it back by donating again.\nRecue Toadz or Noun Glasses NFTs collected by the NounsDAO",

      "title": "NounsDAO Prop 45",
      "content": "# Retain builder to work on nouns.wtf for 6 months\n\nProposal by brianj, submitted on-chain by Noun 22\n\n### TLDR\n\nI have been the Nouns DAO engineering resident for the last 3 months (funded under Prop 17) and I requesting a 6 month continuation of my residency.\n\n### What I did during Prop 17\n\nMy residency under Prop 17 had the following goals:\n\n1. Update the UX of the auction page and integrate it with the Noun profile pages\n2. Update the UX of the governance page\n3. Update the UX of the proposal page\n\nI achieved all of these goals during Prop 17. In addition, I also took it upon myself to do the following:\n\n1. Created the (recently revamped) nounsstats.wtf page which provides insight into Noun rarity and Noun Governance participation\n2. Created (pro bono) a bot to automatically create snapshot votes for Shark DAO based on the creation of new on-chain Nouns DAO proposals\n3. Helped automate parts of Bidder POAP\n4. Review PRs for nouns.wtf\n\n### What I will do during my next residency\n\nI have two main goals for my next residency:\n\n#### Continue to maintain nouns.wtf\n\nI will be taking on more of an ownership role of nouns.wtf going forward. This means that in addition to reviewing inbound PRs, I will be responsible for ongoing bug fixes and improvements. \n\nOne particular task to call out as part of improvements is getting to a few UI details that we didn't have time for during Prop 17 (ex: bid history modal).\n\n#### Make nouns.wtf more robust, extensible, and contributor friendly\n\n1. Revamp CI / CD pipeline to allow easy deploy to prod (process right now is very manual)\n2. Add real time error monitoring so we can rollback bad changes quickly with minimal negative user impact\n3. Generally improve code quality and documentation of the codebase to make it more contributor friendly (in particular, documentation around our Github processes to make it easier for new contributors to onboard)\n4. Refactor nouns.wtf to use a nouns component library to allow people to easily build on our ‚Äúlook and feel‚Äù\n5. Localize nouns.wtf to increase the reach of our brand to non-english audiences \n6. Security audit to assess risk and patch any potential exploits should they exist\n\n### Proposed workflow\n\nI propose the following framework for tracking my progress and giving the DAO visibility into my work. \n\n#### Monthly updates\n\nI will give monthly written updates to the DAO. These will be akin to investor update emails.\nThey will include:\n1. What did I say I was going to get done last month\n2. What of that did I actually get done\n3. What am I committing to getting done in the coming month\n\n#### Project scoping docs\n\nFor every distinct project I take on, I will write a short scoping doc (1-2 pages) which I will share with the community for visibility (either on Discord or Github). In this context one project roughly equals one bullet point in the section of my goals (ex: localize nouns.wtf would be one project).\n\nThese scoping docs will include the following information:\n1. Project goals (project must do x, should do y)\n2. Project non-goals (what, if anything, is explicitly out of scope)\n3. High level description of technical aspects of proposed change\n4. Project milestones with ETAs\n\n#### Github projects + Discord\nIn addition to tracking progress at the project level, I will continue to use Github issues, Github projects, and frequent updates to the Nounders (in a private project Discord channel) to promote accountability and give the DAO visibility into my daily work. \n\n\n### Proposed compensation\n\nI propose that I am compensated 62.52414 ETH over 6 months (10.42069 ETH per month distributed via a Sablier stream).\n\nI think this is a fair rate for 2 reasons:\n1. 22's recent proposal passed at this rate. We were both previously funded by Prop 17\n2. This rate is fairly in line (in fact a bit lower) on an annualized + USD converted basis with what I was making in my previous normie tech job / what I was offered by normie tech companies when I recently interviewed (~4 months ago)\n\n\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nI believe that over the last 3 months, I've show that I can execute with little oversight and generate value for the DAO (in excess of original project scope). I have greatly enjoyed building with all of you over the last 3 months and hope you will give me the opportunity to continue with you on this great journey.",

We will be developing special filaments for the collection‚Äôs color palette. More on this in the next update!\n\n# New proposal for: milestone 3+4 - Patternmaking, Rendering & Modeling, as well as continued Print Testing\n\nI am working with 3 different experts for this part of the project:\n* **Patternmaking**: I have partnered with [Optitex](https://optitex.com/), a leading fashion design software company, who are working with me on patternmaking for the colleciton free of charge.\n* **Modeling**: I am working with a very talented modeler to turn my sketches and the patterns into 3D files that are printable. \n* **Rendering**: I am working with a brilliant 3D designer to create beautiful renderings of the collection, to be used in the Metaverse, or with potential 3D-printable NFTs, and generally to market the collection in the digital realm.\n\n**Here is an example of what a model looks like (these files will be used for 3D printing):**\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-20 at 13.15.30|284x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nouns/optimized/1X/dd57ccf121bdaeee90207a93a4f56fe896cb8823_2_568x1000.jpeg)\n\n**Here is what Rendering looks like:**\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-02-20 at 13.15.30|284x500](https://media4.giphy.com/media/7zY33p99h4C2Cxph0a/giphy.gif?cid=790b761131099bc02407b61b96f8c44ed8440e634d29dc89&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)\n\n\nHere's the budget for these milestones: \n\n* **Modeling 7 outfits (15 items):** 7 ETH\n* **Rendering 7 outfits (15 items)**: 2.3 ETH\n* **Prints tests**: 1 ETH\n* **My work (around 3 months)** 7.6 ETH\n* **Total** = 17.9 ETH\n\nThis would bring the project up to now to a total spend of 21.05 ETH (3.15 + 17.9), which is approx $63K in USD value. I now expect the total cost of the project to be around $100-150K, depending on printing costs and marketing costs (mainly photoshoot/runway).\n\nThank you all for the support.

This is a collaborative process between skaters and city authorities to invest in capital improvements that will enrich a community for decades. The Skatepark Project‚Äôs grant programs have awarded over $10 million to help fund nearly 700 public skateparks in all 50 States, enjoyed by an estimated 6 million people annually. The organization‚Äôs International Program has provided technical and financial support to assist youth through the Skateistan educational programs in Afghanistan, Cambodia, and South Africa. To get involved, visit https://skatepark.org/\n\nWhat is it?\napenoun/Oni will facilitate a design contest for the artwork and The Skatepark Project will source and facilitate the creation of 300 complete skateboards with the winning art to be given away to kids who would not otherwise be able to afford a skateboard.

This proposal covers the first 6 weeks, so the cost is 1.05 ETH\n\n**Risks**\n\nWe‚Äôre not able to improve the conversion and retention of new members.",

      "title": "SIP-00041: Update The Multisig",
      "content": "Author: Goldy\n\n___Purpose___\nTo improve the security of the multisig, and increase availability of signers to execute more effectively.\n\n\n___Summary___\nIn the last update we swapped Xaix/xaix.eth with Christian/cdt.eth. Lamorak dropped out due to not enough time to commit. We need more new trusted members of Sharkdao to replace two legacy signers who are not available to contribute, which is putting a lot of pressure on our more active signers to get things done, and making it hard to execute tasks in a timely manner. Additionally, now that time sensitive tasks like bidding and voting can be delegated, we can improve securirty by making adding more signers in total. This proposal would take us from a 3/6 to a 5/8.\n\n\n___Details___\nProposed multisig signers:\n@Goldy.mov  0x021edd67d43B365a6401a5Ee704Aa6f264F3F4e4\n‚Ä®@jango  0x823b92d6a4b2AED4b15675c7917c9f922ea8ADAD\n‚Ä®@dropnerd  0x40b6df5f6217fb1a1beaf8fdbb9572304aa78c4d\n@cdt.eth  0xD19BF5F0B785c6f1F6228C72A8A31C9f383a49c4\n‚Ä®@Sasquatch \n@nico \n@Synth \n@Jawshua Fisher\n\nNew signers:\nNico, Sasquatch, Synth, Joshua\n\nRemoved signers:\nLithium, DeFi Jesus\n\nRationale:\nNew signers are involved heavily and consistently with SharkDAO, leading the organisation, and have some reputation risk.\n\nNotes:\nThank you Lithium and DeFi Jesus. Lithium and DeFi Jesus are both founding members of SharkDAO and original multis signers, but both have had other commitments making them unable to be available to sign transactions and coordinate multisig operations.‚Ä®‚Ä®\n\n\n___Pros & Cons___\nPros:\n‚Äì Added security\n‚Äì Less pressure on current 4 active signers\n‚Äì More efficiency\n\nCons:\n‚Äì Centralization risk: As we add more signers who are active members of Sharkdao that comes with the side effect that they are all people who work together more and more closely.\n‚Äì This continues our off-chain strategy of governance, when in the long term there is at least some sense that we want to go on-chain ideally",

      "content": "Author: Goldy\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo improve the SharkDAO's ability to participate in Nouns DAO governance, and take pressure off the multisig team ‚Äìtherefore allowing the multisig to add more security.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere is a function in the Nouns contract to delegate votes from a noun to another wallet.\n\nWe should pair the Nouns DAO representitive role with the responsibility to carry out SharkDAO's voting in Nouns DAO, but delegating our nouns votes to the representitive's wallet.\n\n\n## Details\nAll of SharkDAO's votes should still be decided by snapshot, but instead of requiring the multisig to execute the vote (which currently means coordinating 3 members in 24 hours or less), the representitive will carry out SharkDAO's wishes.\n\nIf the delegate ever willfully acts against the wishes of Shark DAO, the multisig shall revoke the delegation and any other responsibilites or access to DAO resources may be stripped.\n\nFor now we should delegate to Goldy, the current Nouns DAO rep, as a test for the system out until the new delegate is chosen.\n\n\n## Notes\nSoon the ability to delegate voting to multiple wallets will become availble (The Nounders team are developing a module for this) which means we can take further pressure off a single delegate and decentralise further if we wish.\n\n\n## Pros & Cons\n**Pros:**\n-Less pressure on multisig team to coordinate\n-Cheaper (gnosis safe transactions are expensive)\n-Should result in an increase in Nouns DAO governance participation from SharkDAO, which was one of the compelling reasons to start a DAO vs using franctional.art to buy a noun, and give us more power/control/input over the system we are taking part in.\n-The less tasks we leave to the multisig team (and more we decentralise) the more we can get done.\n\n\n**Cons:**\n‚ÄìTrust in a single person means increased liklihood that they go rogue and vote against Shark DAO's wishes. The scope in which this can impact the DAO is fairly minimal and the power can be revoked quite easily.",

      "content": "Author: @dropnerd, @kb1900\n\nPurpose\n\n- allows the Coordinape working team to make changes\n\nSummary\n\n- allows the Coordinape administrators (@synth and @dropnerd) to make changes to total Coordinape rewards when they both agree\n\nBackground\n\nThis proposal acts as a functional ammendment to [SIP-00030 Should we fund the Coordinape Test Epoch?](https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth/proposal/Qme6D1nFu5b3VwS9qB41Nvti85cupxiCfMavrHpKErBpjN) which passed on September 28, 2021. The language in the initial proposal was:\n> 2.5 ETH and 875,000 SHARK will be allocated from the treasury for the epoch. The ETH will be released immediately, while the SHARK tokens will be held in escrow (time-locked) for 3 months and then released to recipients.\n\nWhile in discussion with SyndicateDAO, several Sharks received some advice that we may want to separate the Coordinape ETH rewards from the Coordinape SHARK rewards. To preserve flexibility, we propose to set the amount after we discuss more. To maintain accountability to SharkDAO, this proposal specifies a range of acceptable amounts.\n\n- ETH: 0-5 ETH\n- SHARK: 0-2,000,000 SHARK tokens\n\nThe amount decided will be published in a highly visible location.\n\nThe rationale behind this proposal (SIP-00034) is to ensure the coordinape test epoch and future iterations of coordinape have additional flexibility as the advisement landscape matures and influences decision making regarding DAO contribution incentives, finances, reimbursement etc.\n\nBenefits\n\n- synth and dropnerd can better acknowledge and potentially integrate new advisement regarding reward amounts to contributors within the coordinape system\n\nRisks\n\n- synth and dropnerd may go rogue and change the rewards to unfairly reward contributors too much or too little.",

      "content": "**Authors:** @dropnerd, @forager\n\n## Purpose\n\nWhen SharkDAO started, we selected 3 initial Gnosis Safe signers. Through many votes, we have increased that count to 6. However, it is difficult to get 3 signers together to bid, especially as Noun O'Clock times shift. This has caused SharkDAO to not bid when we otherwise might have, and it has also caused SharkDAO to bid in larger increments than necessary due to the difficult of executing multiple smaller bids.\n\n@forager wrote a smart contract that allows any individual Safe signer to submit a bid. The contract is deployed on Ethereum mainnet at the link below. We encourage members to look at the contract code and attempt to find any issues prior to voting.\n\nOur goal is to balance bidding capability with security. **Introducing this contract may cause total fund loss. Please read the risk disclosure.**\n\n**Contract:**\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xD1977351532fE19C43d8B3E209570c3dF02D2241#code\n\n## Summary\n\n- Authorizes the use of this smart contract before a formal code audit\n- This smart contract allows any individual elected Gnosis Safe signer to submit bids on the Auction Nerds' behalf\n- Requires the auction committee to schedule a formal code audit by the end of October. Requires this audit to happen before the end of the year.\n- Creation of a 10 ETH DAO bug bounty for anyone who can break the contract to gain access to ETH or Nouns (~5% of what could be hacked during normal operation)\n\n## Details\n\nDetails on the smart contract can be found at:\n - Overview of methods and access design:\n     - https://github.com/theforager/sharkdao-bid-management\n - GitHub code:\n     - https://github.com/theforager/sharkdao-bid-management/blob/main/contracts/SharkDaoBidder.sol\n - Deployed code:\n     - https://etherscan.io/address/0xD1977351532fE19C43d8B3E209570c3dF02D2241#code\n\nSeveral Shark volunteers have tested this code without finding any issues. However, we may have missed an issue. Here is the checklist of pre-launch testing:\n\n - Unit tests of the contract (code [here](https://github.com/theforager/sharkdao-bid-management/blob/main/test/SharkDaoBidder.test.js))\n - Live testing on Rinkeby test network (testing plan [here](https://hackmd.io/@forager/HkB4D_ZQK))\n - Unit testing of Mainnet contract using a fork (code [here](https://github.com/theforager/sharkdao-bid-management/blob/main/test/Mainnet.test.js))\n - Live testing on Mainnet (transactions [here](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xD1977351532fE19C43d8B3E209570c3dF02D2241), invalid access showed reverts in Metamask)\n\nThere is an opportunity cost of missing out on bidding for many Nouns. Thus, this proposal authorizes the use of this smart contract before the formal code audit.\n\nThis proposal requires the auction committee to find a company to audit the smart contract. The following timeline applies:\n\n- The formal code audit should be scheduled by the end of October, unless extended by a future proposal\n- The formal code audit should happen by the end of the year, unless extended by a future proposal\n- Any changes recommended by the code audit should happen within one month of the audit completion, unless extended by a future proposal\n\nIf any of these deadlines are not met or extended, SharkDAO should withdraw all funds back to our Gnosis Safe as soon as possible and stop using this contract.\n\n## Risks\n\nWith any smart contract, there is a risk of bugs or other security issues. **This could cause us to lose all the ETH and Nouns in the smart contract. In the worst case, this could be the entire treasury. The DAO accepts this risk by passing this proposal and using the contract.**\n\nA rogue Gnosis signer could cause us to overbid beyond the Auction Nerd consensus. (Auction Nerds are a group introduced in [SIP-00022](https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth/proposal/QmUoABajUYFgurpmsnBtXiTK9UoLX7djFuwF188LpcQGfP) consensus). While the rogue signer would not be able to withdraw funds to their own wallet, they could overpay for a Noun if they feel like it. This proposal recommends that SharkDAO removes any such rogue signer.\n\nA hacker may exploit a signer to cause us to overbid beyond the Auction Nerd consensus. This proposal recommends that signers use a hardware wallet for their signing activities.",

      "content": "Based on feedback from NounsDAO and SharkDAO there seems to be consensus on this plan.\n\nShould SharkDAO submit the below proposal to run a pilot program to get FREE Glasses for 1 year to kids in need and put it on-chain for NounsDAO?\n\nFull breakdown and feedback below:\nhttps://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-8-perpetual-glasses-for-kids-in-need/226\n\n**Main Points of Proposal**\nFitz would like to eventually build to a perpetual funding mechanism in order to expand our existing social good efforts and deliver eyewear on an ongoing basis to kids in need. In the interim, we‚Äôd like to propose a pilot program to prove out the model and refine delivery mechanism:\n- $30K allocation from Nouns treasury to provide approximately 300 no-cost vision tests plus Fitz Frames memberships to kids in need, initially in a limited geographical focus area.\n- Fitz will provide annual memberships at cost of $100)/kid/year discounted from $185.  Annual Membership consists of two pairs of custom fit glasses plus unliminted replacements.\n- Fitz will provide an additional free pair of Noun Frames, mimicking their favorite Nouns, limited to an initial selection of 10 Noun options for the Pilot Program.\n- Vision to Learn, will identify recipients and provide no-cost eye exams within the geographical focus area. Initial prospects are Ohio and Detroit.\n- Initial Pilot Program is expected to run approximately 90 days, at which point Fitz will present a report of progress to the NounsDAO.\n- At that point the NounsDAO can vote to expand, continue, or suspend the pilot program.\n- Based on findings from the initial Pilot Program, elements can be refined including: delivery mechanism, offering, and outreach. Additionally, Fitz Frames will work to try and secure additional underwriting in order to extend the reach of the program. (possibly through Medicaid reimbursement, or local philanthropic partners)\n\n- In order to promote the program (and help surface Nouns to a wider public awareness) we propose dedicating an additional 2ETH to develop outreach materials including print, short form animation, and a dedicated website. This will target schools, the student recipients of glasses, and broader public. In addition to promotion of the program, this is an opportunity to introduce the technology elements underpinning both Nouns and Fitz Frames, and develop age-appropriate STEM curriculum for the kids who receive the glasses.\n\nNouns is a fantastic example of people leveraging technology to come together and build long-term value in perpetuity.  Fitz leverages the power of technology to change the lives of kids. We think this is a natural partnership that would not only do a tremendous amount of good, but could serve as tangible application of blockchain doing tangible good. At Fitz, we believe that those who can see the world are the ones who can change the world. NounsDAO embodies this ethos completely, and we couldn‚Äôt imagine a better partner.\n\n**Noun Frames**\nFitz will integrate Nouns Frames into their application so that users can pick their favorite Noun and receive glasses that mimic those frames as well as have the Noun itself printed on the side of the frames as well as the Noun number printed on the inside.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/90cY6Fp.jpg)\n\n**About Fitz:**\nFitz Frames: https://www.fitzframes.com/\n\nFitz for Good - how Fitz has worked with VTL to provide glasses for kids in the past:\nhttps://vimeo.com/377468371\n\n\nMore info can be found below:\nhttps://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/proposal-8-perpetual-glasses-for-kids-in-need/226",

      "content": "**Authors:** @Lamorak, @Sasquatch\n\n## Purpose \nSet aside 20 ETH of funding to be used to support Noun adjacent NFT projects by purchasing works direct from artists in the ecosystem.\n\n## Summary\n- There are NFT projects that currently exist or that may exist in the future which either directly or indirectly relate to the Nouns project. \n- It is in SharkDAO‚Äôs best interest to support this ecosystem and to be a purchaser of NFTs in this space\n- Allocating 20 ETH of treasury solely to these purchases will allow SharkDAO to take on reasonable exposure to these Nouns adjacent projects, and is a small amount proportional to the overall treasury\n\n## Rationale\n- There are currently, and will continue to be, several NFT projects either directly or indirectly related to the Nouns project. Directly related projects would include things such as Noun derivative works. Indirectly related projects would include NFTs that further the CC0 ecosystem, allowing others to leverage building blocks to create their own projects.\n- Purchasing NFTs in this space furthers SharkDAOs values of Building, Innovate, and Ecosystem. \n    * We define Building as ‚Äúcommunity, experience and culture‚Äù - purchasing these Noun adjacent projects allows us to support the building of the Nouns community, experience and culture. \n    * We define Innovate as ‚Äúspeed and collaboration to drive growth‚Äù - purchasing these Noun adjacent projects would give SharkDAO access to new communities of passionate individuals and allow us to tap into those innovative communities to drive growth. \n    * We define Ecosystem as ‚Äúcreating value around the Nouns, NFT, and the Web3 space‚Äù - purchasing these Noun adjacent projects would help increase the visibility of the projects and further the overall presence of the ecosystem. \n\n## Selection Process\n- The curation team, initially composed of the individuals named below, will identify potential non-Noun NFTs for SharkDAO to purchase. The curation team is an open group, and any Shark may join by self-identifying as interested in being a member of the team. The curation team will post details of the NFT and a short explanation of why they believe it is a worthwhile purchase in the newly created #shark-bait channel. All Sharks are then able to provide an emoji reaction signaling if the NFT should be purchased or passed. The channel will be react-only for all non-curation team members. The polling period for new purchase posts will be 24 hours, at which point a snapshot of the vote will be taken and the curation team will take action based on the majority vote.\n\n## Curation Team\n- @Sasquatch\n- @Lamorak \n- @JawshuaFisher\n- @Cryptasha\n\n## NFT Criteria\n- Purchases direct from the artist only\n- 1 ETH maximum price\n- Primary collecting categories are expected to include, but are not limited to:\n    - Noun derivative projects\n    - Pixel art\n  - CC0 \n\n## Risks\n- Purchasing a non-Noun NFT is perceived as a divergence from SharkDAO‚Äôs core mission\n- The NFTs purchased decline in value, or lose their value entirely\n- Individuals on the curation team may have a conflict of interest, causing them to favor recommending the purchase of works by specific artists\n- The perception of SharkDAO favoring certain artists over others and the potential to disappoint artists whose work is not selected to be purchased by the DAO\n",

      "content": "**Authors:** @dropnerd, @forager\n\n## Purpose\n\nWhen SharkDAO started, we selected 3 initial Gnosis Safe signers. Through many votes, we have increased that count to 6. However, it is difficult to get 3 signers together to bid, especially as Noun O'Clock times shift. This has caused SharkDAO to not bid when we otherwise might have, and it has also caused SharkDAO to bid in larger increments than necessary due to the difficult of executing multiple smaller bids.\n\n@forager wrote a smart contract that allows any individual Safe signer to submit a bid. The contract is deployed on Ethereum mainnet at the link below. We encourage members to look at the contract code and attempt to find any issues prior to voting.\n\nOur goal is to balance bidding capability with security. **Introducing this contract may cause total fund loss. Please read the risk disclosure.**\n\n**Contract:**\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0xD1977351532fE19C43d8B3E209570c3dF02D2241#code\n\n## Summary\n\n- Authorizes the use of this smart contract before a formal code audit\n- This smart contract allows any individual elected Gnosis Safe signer to submit bids on the Auction Nerds' behalf\n- Requires the auction committee to schedule a formal code audit by the end of October. Requires this audit to happen before the end of the year.\n- Creation of a 10 ETH DAO bug bounty for anyone who can break the contract to gain access to ETH or Nouns (~5% of what could be hacked during normal operation)\n\n## Details\n\nDetails on the smart contract can be found at:\n - Overview of methods and access design:\n     - https://github.com/theforager/sharkdao-bid-management\n - GitHub code:\n     - https://github.com/theforager/sharkdao-bid-management/blob/main/contracts/SharkDaoBidder.sol\n - Deployed code:\n     - https://etherscan.io/address/0xD1977351532fE19C43d8B3E209570c3dF02D2241#code\n\nSeveral Shark volunteers have tested this code without finding any issues. However, we may have missed an issue. Here is the checklist of pre-launch testing:\n\n - Unit tests of the contract (code [here](https://github.com/theforager/sharkdao-bid-management/blob/main/test/SharkDaoBidder.test.js))\n - Live testing on Rinkeby test network (testing plan [here](https://hackmd.io/@forager/HkB4D_ZQK))\n - Unit testing of Mainnet contract using a fork (code [here](https://github.com/theforager/sharkdao-bid-management/blob/main/test/Mainnet.test.js))\n - Live testing on Mainnet (transactions [here](https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xD1977351532fE19C43d8B3E209570c3dF02D2241), invalid access showed reverts in Metamask)\n\nThere is an opportunity cost of missing out on bidding for many Nouns. Thus, this proposal authorizes the use of this smart contract before the formal code audit.\n\nThis proposal requires the auction committee to find a company to audit the smart contract. The following timeline applies:\n\n- The formal code audit should be scheduled by the end of October, unless extended by a future proposal\n- The formal code audit should happen by the end of the year, unless extended by a future proposal\n- Any changes recommended by the code audit should happen within one month of the audit completion, unless extended by a future proposal\n\nIf any of these deadlines are not met or extended, SharkDAO should withdraw all funds back to our Gnosis Safe as soon as possible and stop using this contract.\n\n## Risks\n\nWith any smart contract, there is a risk of bugs or other security issues. **This could cause us to lose all the ETH and Nouns in the smart contract. In the worst case, this could be the entire treasury. The DAO accepts this risk by passing this proposal and using the contract.**\n\nA rogue Gnosis signer could cause us to overbid beyond the Auction Nerd consensus. (Auction Nerds are a group introduced in [SIP-00022](https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth/proposal/QmUoABajUYFgurpmsnBtXiTK9UoLX7djFuwF188LpcQGfP) consensus). While the rogue signer would not be able to withdraw funds to their own wallet, they could overpay for a Noun if they feel like it. This proposal recommends that SharkDAO removes any such rogue signer.\n\nA hacker may exploit a signer to cause us to overbid beyond the Auction Nerd consensus. This proposal recommends that signers use a hardware wallet for their signing activities.",

      "title": "SIP-00030 Should we fund the Coordinape Test Epoch?",
      "content": "Authors: @Synth, @Minterras, @dropnerd, @kb1900, @Lamorak\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nSharkDAO members are spending a lot of time and effort in growing and bringing value to the community. It is important that the community rewards them. We think that many members of SharkDAO would contribute more and execute faster if we rewarded them. This is not intended to be the only mechanism to reward contributors of the DAO. \n\n**Summary**\n\n- SharkDAO will reward contributors via a Coordinape circle.\n- In the circle, active SharkDAO volunteers will receive GIVE tokens that are intended to be given to Sharks who are actively driving SharkDAO initiatives forward. **These GIVE tokens will turn into ETH and SHARK for the recipient.**\n- **2.5 ETH and 875,000 SHARK** will be allocated from the treasury for the epoch. The ETH will be released immediately, while the SHARK tokens will be held in escrow (time-locked) for 3 months and then released to recipients.\n- **Anyone who has spoken in a committee channel or project channel since September 1st, 2021 will be eligible for circle membership.** Initial circle will be all authors of proposals posted on snapshot. (See Circle List)\n- Based upon the results of the test period, a decision will be made by SharkDAO on whether or not to continue using the platform.\n\n**Logistics**\n\nIf this proposal is passed, tokenomics volunteers will work with the Coordinape team on getting SharkDAO‚Äôs Coordinape ‚Äúcircle‚Äù set up as soon as possible. The Circle administrators will be @Synth and @Dropnerd for the first epoch and can be later discussed if SharkDAO wishes to alter the Coordinape circle admins.\n\n- There will be a grant for this two week test epoch of 2.5 ETH and 875,000 SHARK. The ETH will be sent soon after the epoch ends, while the SHARK will remain time-locked and held by the DAO for up to 3 months. The reasoning for this time lock is that contributors will be able to see immediate rewards for their contributions in the form of ETH while still being incentivized to increase the value of the SHARK token through further contributions.\n- Throughout the trial Epoch, the Circle Sharks will be able to send their 1000 GIVE to other Circle Sharks whom they see adding value to the Shark ecosystem and deserve to be rewarded.\n    - Circle members are highly encouraged to attach a note indicating why the Give was sent\n    - Note: a Circle Shark is free to give as much or as little of their 1000 GIVE as they see fit. Any un-gifted GIVE will be burned at the end of the Epoch.\n    - At the end of the Epoch, a spreadsheet will be produced with each Circle Shark‚Äôs ending GIVE allocations that have been sent to them. (e.g Shark earned 200 GIVE tokens this cycle, there were 1800 GIVE tokens allocated after burns, Shark earns 1/9 of the allocation)\n    - Coordinape provides a map of all GIVE allocations to view how contributions are interacting with one another:\n- If the GIVE token allocation seems highly suspicious, a proposal may be put in place to adjust the allocation or cancel it altogether.\n- If no proposal is put up to adjust the allocation for 36 hours after the epoch ends, multisig will then coordinate the distribution of funds based proportionally on the amount of GIVE tokens each Circle Shark has.\n\n**Circle List**\n\nAnyone who has spoken in a committee channel or project channel on discord from September 1st, 2021 will be eligible for circle membership. If you have spoken in a committee chat/project chat before September first, you are encouraged to send a message once again to confirm an active eligible status.\n\nStep 1: The initial circle list will be anyone who has authored a proposal. Initial circle members will have 24 hours to respond to be included in the first list. If not, the initial members can be included in step 2. The initial list will be as follows :\n\n@Lithium, @Rayo, @Forager, @Lamorak, @Dropnerd, @Sasquatch, @Synth, @nico, @kb1900, @dopalisa, @RYGA, @huh.eth, @nicholas, @Minterras\n\nStep 2: This initial list of members will then vouch for anyone eligible who has submitted a request (a short form) to be a member of the Coordinape circle. Members who request to be a part of the circle will have to receive vouches from >8.008% of the total circle members. (This will be 2 vouches from the initial list). Members will have up to 24 hours after the initial circle members join to apply for the circle to be included at the start of the epoch. If eligible members miss the deadline, they can submit mid-epoch\n\nStep 3: Eligible members may apply late to the epoch. If an applicant receives the vouches necessary during the epoch, they will be given a pro-rata share of GIVE tokens. (eg. Synth joins 1 week into the 2 epoch, Synth receives 500 of the 1000 give tokens to allocate)\n\n**Possible Success Metrics**\n\n- Development velocity increases.\n- Sharks who have become less active become more active during the trial period.\n- New Shark volunteers indicate that Coordinape rewards are a major factor for deciding whether they would contribute.\n- SharkDAO is able to recruit talent and maintain talent as it scales.\n\n**Risks:**\n\n- The initial test circle does not accurately reflect core Shark contributors and reward contributions equitably\n- A test period run without a sufficient tangible incentive (i.e. ETH or $SHARK) would not provide an accurate representation of the platform‚Äôs abilities. We think 2.5ETH and 875,000 SHARK should be enough.\n- The allocated ETH and SHARK for this epoch is considered ‚Äúwasted‚Äù by some members who did not participate or get rewarded.\n- Members could collude within the Coordinape platform and give each other all of their GIVE, alienating other members and souring the appetite to use the platform long term. We intend to audit the rewards and see which improvements we can make.\n- Coordinape does not yet store data on-chain. Trial period would be required to be overseen by a few SharkDAO Admins ‚Üí could lead to confusion and disputes around final tallies/rewards/fairness. We will publish all reward information within Discord.",

This proposal‚Äôs purpose is to discover fresh perspectives by paying Sharks to share their experience.\n\n**Summary**\n---\nSharkDao has been blessed with organic interest and support from new members. The specific purpose of this user research campaign is to discover why new Sharks are joining the DAO. This campaign needs funds for paying interviewees. These funds would allow SharkDao to investigate its source of momentum. The findings will offer the community information on how to improve and sustain its properity.\n\n**Details**\n---\n‚Ä¢ Each interviewee was compensated $50 USD worth of SHARK tokens (5000 tokens on average as calculated on SushiSwap).\n\n‚Ä¢ 8-12 new Sharks will be interviewed.\n\n‚Ä¢ Total cost for twelve interviews is exactly 60,000 Shark Tokens in compensation and .0131 Eth in gas fees.\n\n‚Ä¢ Proof of expenses: https://etherscan.io/address/0xF9AC85E91bCfdb5b8F3080d599416F0c659dD29b\n\n‚Ä¢ To ensure interviewee‚Äôs privacy, only the final findings will be released publicly.\n\n**Pros & Cons**\n---\n\nPros\n‚Ä¢ SharkDao will discover its core value proposition.\n‚Ä¢ SharkDao will discover where it acquires new community members.\n‚Ä¢ There is a chance to discover opportunities that SharkDao may not be aware of.\n‚Ä¢ Provides insights that SharkDao contributors can act upon.\n\nCons\n‚Ä¢ There is no guarantee the interviews will discover new insights.\n‚Ä¢ User research interviews can be misused or misinterpreted.\n‚Ä¢ DopaLisa can act in bad faith and twist results.",

The full proposal details and discussion can be found here:\nhttps://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/fomo-nouns-force-mint-our-nouns/117/24\n\nThis project sprung out of early discussions in Shark DAO about how to mint a Shark, and we still aim for the first use of our tool to be minting a Shark. After significant research and discussion, we realized this tool could be expanded to benefit the entire Nouns ecosystem and became the FOMO Nouns project.\n\nPurpose üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n---\nThis proposal's goal is:\n\n- Ask Shark DAO to officially initiate the Nouns DAO on-chain voting\nWe think this project is a great example of the impact Shark DAO and its members can have on the Nouns and NFT ecosystem, and we hope it's a great milestone for the DAO to sponsor its first home-grown initiative in Nouns DAO.\n\nVoting yes on this Snapshot does not constitute a 'yes' vote for the proposal itself. This Snapshot is just to propose FOMO Nouns on-chain.\n\nVote Specifics üó≥\n---\n\nYes: Use SharkDAOs Nouns to post FOMO Nouns proposal on chain.\n\nNo: Do not post the FOMO Nouns proposal on chain\n\nEvaluation\n---\n\nPros:\n\nShows Shark DAO and our community can actively drive the Nouns ecosystem forward\nOfficially launch our first Nouns DAO proposal\nCons:\n\nNot all sharks may agree with the proposal specifics\nNot all sharks may want to sponsor a proposal that doesn't directly benefit the SharkDAO",

The full proposal details and discussion can be found here:\nhttps://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/fomo-nouns-force-mint-our-nouns/117/24\n\nThis project sprung out of early discussions in Shark DAO about how to mint a Shark, and we still aim for the first use of our tool to be minting a Shark. After significant research and discussion, we realized this tool could be expanded to benefit the entire Nouns ecosystem and became the FOMO Nouns project.\n\nPurpose üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\nThis proposal's goal is:\n - Ask Shark DAO to officially initiate the Nouns DAO on-chain voting\n\nWe think this project is a great example of the impact Shark DAO and its members can have on the Nouns and NFT ecosystem, and we hope it's a great milestone for the DAO to sponsor its first home-grown initiative in Nouns DAO.\n\n Voting yes on this Snapshot does not constitute a 'yes' vote for the proposal itself. This Snapshot is just to propose FOMO Nouns on-chain.  \n\n\nVote Specifics üó≥\n\n**Yes:** Use SharkDAOs Nouns to post [FOMO Nouns proposal](https://discourse.nouns.wtf/t/fomo-nouns-force-mint-our-nouns/117/24) on chain.\n\n**No:** Do not post the FOMO Nouns proposal on chain\n\nEvaluation \n\n**Pros:**\n- Shows Shark DAO and our community can actively drive the Nouns ecosystem forward\n- Officially launch our first Nouns DAO proposal\n\n**Cons:**\n- Not all sharks may agree with the proposal specifics\n- Not all sharks may want to sponsor a proposal that doesn't directly benefit the SharkDAO",

      "title": "SIP-00022: Establish Noun Acquisition Targets & Bidding Framework",
      "content": "Authors: @Lamorak, @Sasquatch, @Dropnerd\n\n\nPurpose:\n\nIn order to have a shared vision for what SharkDAOs future may hold, we would like to establish guidelines for how many Nouns SharkDAO will target acquiring. This will allow future funding rounds to follow a set cadence and target raise amount and will empower the auction committee to acquire Nouns while using discretion to preserve the treasury. \n\nWe propose that SharkDAO target ownership of at least 5% of outstanding Nouns at any given time, preserving our ability to bring proposals in Nouns DAO and encouraging the DAO to expand its member base while contributing to the Nouns ecosystem. We also propose that the auction committee, composed of the individuals defined below, be given the discretion to follow a bidding strategy that maintains this target ownership while ensuring that considerations from all Sharks wishing to share a view are considered.\n\n\nAuction Committee Members:\n- Dropnerd\n- Sasquatch\n- Lamorak\n- Phuktep\n- Synth\n\n\n\nSummary:\n- Target owning at least 5% of Nouns at any given time.\n- Set the final week of each month as the fundraising window for the coming month. The Juicebox will be open to fund next month‚Äôs Noun purchases and operating expenses.\n- Grant the Auction Committee autonomy in establishing bidding strategy.\n\n\nRationale:\n1. 5% Noun Ownership\n\nWe believe that it is in SharkDAO‚Äôs best interest to always be in a position to raise proposals in NounsDAO, as this will allow us to help shape NounsDAO‚Äôs roadmap.\n\n2. Monthly Fundraising Cadence\n\nBecause the Nouns supply increases daily, SharkDAO needs to continually raise funds in order to maintain 5% ownership of outstanding Noun supply. Establishing a regular cadence for raising these funds, rather than doing so on an ad hoc basis, has several benefits. A regular cadence ensures that the Treasury is not overdrawn. It allows us to create budgets and forecasts with greater accuracy, and ensures SharkDAO members and prospective members can prepare for the next funding window.\n\n3. Auction Committee Autonomy\n\nActing with speed and discretion are required to acquire Nouns at a good value. The changing dynamics every day and our governance pipeline delay (48 hours) make it impossible to bring every prospective acquisition to a vote. Providing the Auction Committee with a mandate to maintain at least 5% Noun ownership at any given time while never spending greater than 70% of treasury on any Noun provides the Auction Committee the flexibility to succeed while providing visibility for Sharks.\n\n\nOverview of the Proposed Bidding Process:\n\n1. For each new Noun, a volunteer sends an emoji poll to the new Daily Bid channel, only accessible to SharkDAO members. The question: ‚ÄúNoun ## has just been released. Should SharkDAO bid on this Noun?‚Äù Each daily poll can be a thread for discussion or comment and will be read by the auction committee. Additionally, members can react with emojis representing a Yes vote or a No vote. **This is a non-binding vote.**\n2. While the results are non-binding, the auction committee will weigh the SharkDAO membership sentiment in the following manner:\n    \n    - If 75% or more of the responses are in favor of bidding on the Noun, the committee will make best efforts to secure the Noun within reason.\n    \n    - If 50% or more of the responses are in favor of bidding on the Noun, the committee will actively participate in the auction for the Noun.\n    \n    - If less than 50% of responses are in favor of bidding on the Noun, the committee will not participate in the auction.\n    \n    - Note: The committee reserves the right to bid on any Noun in the event that the opportunity arises to purchase a Noun at below-market rates.\n    \n3. The Auction Committee, in conjunction with the multisig signers, will coordinate bidding strategy for any Nouns that are being bid on.\n    - The Auction Committee will never suggest a budget of over 70% of the standing treasury.\n4. The SharkDAO signers will submit bids on nouns.wtf on behalf of SharkDAO.\n\n\nRisks:\n1. Members may feel less involved in Noun bidding decisions than they did in the early stage of SharkDAO.\n2. Disclosing our budget leaks more info than simply giving the auction committee full discretion over the budget.\n3. Not being fully transparent about our bidding strategy may go against members‚Äô principles and against the DAO‚Äôs principles in general - we would recommend that any member who wants to be more involved join the Auction Committee.\n",

He has contributed to countless technical, social, and governance related developments. He is a leader in the community and always advocating for the fairest, most transparent, most diligent and secure approach to running the DAO.\n‚Äì In being one of the most active members dropnerd is likely to be a very available signer.\n\nCons:\n‚Äì Centralization risk: Goldy.mov, Lithium, dropnerd already work closely together running the discord. dropnerd holds a ~42K Juicebox tokens (bought for ~0.05ETH), which connects him to Jango (note: SharkDAO owns ~18m Juicebox tokens).\n‚Äì dropnerd was the only candidate nominated in this round of multisig changes.\n‚Äì dropnerd has only maintained an online presence since the beginning of August.\n‚Äì more wallet signers is more points of failure, ideally we will keep adding more signers to the main treasury wallet and setup either whitelisting workaround for bidding and small transactions, or a second multisig for those transactions (this will be the next proposal I work on in relation to the multisig).",

      "title": "Should we reopen JuiceBox at 350k Shark per ETH?",
      "content": "SIP-00020: Reopen SharkDAO Juicebox for Funding Cycle \"DeepSea\"\nAuthors: @Synth, @Lamorak, @dropnerd, @RYGA, @kb1900 (on behalf of Tokenomics Committee)\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nWe propose to reopen the SharkDAO Juicebox membership platform to continue fundraising for more Nouns, increase membership, and grow the treasury to set up SharkDAO for success. The SHARK per ETH rate offered on Juicebox is determined by market conditions with a transparent formula outlined in this proposal.\n\nWe propose to raise up to 400 ETH this cycle and believe this will allow SharkDAO to acquire two additional Nouns before needing to raise further funds.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Funding cycle \"DeepSea\"\n- Open Juicebox ASAP if this proposal passes, September 1 at the latest \n- 400 ETH cap\n- Exchange rate will be  350,000 Shark per ETH this cycle\n\n**Funding Cap:**\n\nWe propose to raise 400 ETH this cycle because this allows SharkDAO to acquire two additional Nouns before needing to raise additional funds. After our fourth Noun (the next Noun SharkDAO buys) is purchased, the Tokenomics Committee may work on the proposal for funding cycle \"E.\" This proposal should go live shortly after our fourth Noun has been acquired. \n\n**Contingency Plan:**\n\nWe plan to leave the SharkDAO Juicebox membership platform open for as long as needed until the 400 ETH goal is met, if it is not met in a timely manner we will work on ways to complete the funding needed in further proposals. \n\n**Exchange Rate:**\n\nEarlier this week, SharkDAO approved SIP-00016. This proposal allowed us to create and fund a SushiSwap pool. We base the new exchange rate on the signals from this pool.\n\nThe exchange rate will be based on a discount to the ETH weighted average exchange rate over the trading period from the opening of the SushiSwap pool through to 21:00 UTC on 8/29. This period represents 36.65 ETH of inflow across 68 transactions. The weighted exchange rate over this period is 324,586 Shark per Ether. Tokenomics committee recommends opening the Juicebox pool at a rate of 350,000 Shark per ETH, a 8% discount to the weighted exchange rate, which we believe is a fair entry point for new purchasers and also incentivizes existing Shark holders who may have purchased through SushiSwap to decrease the average price of their holdings by buying more Shark through Juicebox, providing them potential for further future upside.\n\nSharkDao **strongly encourages** buying on Juicebox over SushiSwap in order to further the development of the DAO with new funds. SharkDAO will be targeting substantially more volume on Juicebox over SushiSwap. \n\nWe would like to note that the proposed exchange rate of 350,000 Shark per ETH does represent a premium to the current price on SushiSwap, which at time of writing is 392,994. We believe that this is justified by the improved buying experience provided by Juicebox, and also do not believe that there is risk of an insider or other party arbitraging the SushiSwap pool as they would not be able to sell their SHARK tokens for profit until there is more buying interest inside the pool.\n\n**Reopen Date:**\n\nSharkDAO aims to open our Juicebox with the exchange rate of 350,000 Shark per ETH. We estimate this will happen a few hours after this proposal passes, targeting 0:00 UTC on September 1, 2021, as the multisig needs to coordinate, create, and sign the reopen request. The reopening will be announced on all socials (Twitter, SharkDAO Discord, and more).\n\n**Risks:**\n\nJuicebox does not support capping funding amount. Overflow funds will generally be accepted until SharkDAO closes Juicebox. Large funds or whales could acquire the majority of SHARK tokens. The DAO's multisig will close the funding cycle when the 400 ETH limit is reached, but in extreme cases may need to consider forking the token to prevent an actor from taking a majority stake in SharkDAO.\n\nIssuing this funding cycle will dilute voting power for existing members.\n\n**Links:**\n\nSIP-00016 https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth/proposal/QmT7y9h6QrSXz79PPbYftYtNvPG83ybXFSmUzxhzWKvPHw\n\nSharkDAO on JuiceBox\nhttps://juicebox.money/#/p/sharkdao\n\nSushiSwap Pool\nhttps://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0x2240ef04bb3e2601977d2d47aa3287628ad71156\n\nFootnote: Funding cycles will now be alphabetical going forward. (i.e next funding cycle will start with the letter \"e\" to represent the 5th funding cycle.)",

      "content": "Author: @Lithium#1221\n\nPurpose:\n\nThis proposal is asking to acquire funding for the creation of 3 commemorative SharkDAO NFT‚Äôs and is asking for 5 ETH from the treasury to get this made.\n\nExplanation:\n\nRight after acquisition of noun 2 by SharkDAO there were plenty of talks brewing about creating a commemorative NFT. At the time we were moving very fast and people were pouring into the DAO by the minute. Now that things have cooled off this is the perfect opportunity to get something like this done. This is something we want to make so that people can get an NFT to commemorate our noun acquisitions.\n\nNot only that but this would be our first NFT project, something to kick it all off.\n\nThe three NFT‚Äôs that will be made are the following:\n\n- One for those who were in the DAO before the purchase of noun 2\n- One for those of who were in the DAO before the purchase of noun 5.\n- One for those who were in the DAO before the purchase of noun 15.\n\nThese costs are to pay the artist (currently Coral Orca [1]) and developer (currently Rayo [2]) for the creation of the art, the custom smart contract and its deployment.\n\nDistribution:\n\nThese will not be airdropped! The way that these will be distributed would be through a minting window. Currently the thought is to create a one week window for people to mint their commemorative NFT. So yes you will have to pay gas to mint however there is no actual price to mint. A similar example would be the mintpass from pixelvault.\n\nIf you were in the dao before the purchase of all three nouns you would be eligible to mint all three of the commemorative NFTs. This same logic applies to those who got in after noun 2 but before noun 5, they would be able to get the noun 15 commemorative nft as well.\n\nRoyalties:\n\n2.5% minimum royalties  on transactions will be paid to SharkDAO‚Äôs treasury.\n\nPros:\n- We get a cool NFT\n- It‚Äôs our first NFT, dipping our shark toes into the shark infested waters.\n\nCons:\n- Cost of ETH\n\nVoting YES on this proposal:\n- 5 eth will be granted for the creation of commemorative SharkDAO NFT‚Äôs\n\nVoting NO on this proposal:\n- 5 eth will not be granted for the creation of commemorative SharkDAO NFT‚Äôs, thus they will not be created.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n1. https://twitter.com/coralorca\n2. https://twitter.com/0xRayo",

Most DAOs that you can join work within opaque Discord channels. Openness inspires confidence and promotes information symmetry.\n\nCons:\n\n- Focusing on building may prevent us from pursuing other revenue-generating schemes, like flipping.\n- Being different can be controversial.\n- Being inclusive could lead to a collective action problem.\n- Being transparent exposes us to parasites who actively work against us.",

      "content": "Proposal: Governance v2\nAuthors: @dropnerd#1449, @huh.eth#5761, @Lithium#2336\n\nThere are several problems with our current governance model.\n\nOur tooling is insufficient for us to understand what our quorum should be for any given vote.\nSeveral proposals have reached consensus but failed to pass our quorum rule. This includes the original governance proposal!\n3 days is too slow for volunteers to react to NounsDAO votes and slows down planning and execution.\nThis proposal addresses these shortcomings.\n\nDetails\n\nWe propose:\n\nSet the quorum at 35 million SHARK tokens. This targets 10%, and the authors suggest that we raise this in the future to match token counts.\n\nApprove former proposals that technically failed quorum but had majority support.\n\nClosing the DAO: https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth/proposal/QmdPS7cNu3X61Dsvfs1wd2rC5UTkNcHQYMHhj49N1fcoj1)\nAuthorizing Noun Bidding: https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth/proposal/QmbCwVaKUbmUyDRFihQdWPg99EnQTW7ZV4DwSXyGZ7mt9M\nListing on Sushiswap: https://snapshot.org/#/sharkdao.eth/proposal/QmT7y9h6QrSXz79PPbYftYtNvPG83ybXFSmUzxhzWKvPHw\n(We leave out governance v1 to prevent any unforeseen conflicts from making the governance proposal unclear.)\n\nDefine the process for adopting a proposal. We take inspiration from the governance v1 proposal.\nThe proposer starts a thread in #discuss-proposals containing a draft of the full text of the proposal. We recommend consulting previous proposals for a format. This thread should collect feedback for at least 24 hours. This period is for members to debate and add pros and cons to the proposal. Moving to the next step requires two :white_check_mark: emojis, including one from the original proposer. We recommend that there be emoji consensus before proceeding.\n\nOnce the thread meets the two conditions, the proposer starts a thread in #vote containing a link to the Snapshot vote. The Snapshot contains the final text of the proposal. This vote must be open for at least 24 hours (reduced from 48 hours). This period is for members to approve or disapprove a proposal that has feedback.\n\nPros:\n\nWe resolve the uncertain status of the previous proposals that technically failed quorum.\nWe make it easier to check for the presence of a quorum.\nCons:\n\nWe will go below 10% quorum threshold if this threshold is not adjusted in time.\nIt could be more expressive of the voters‚Äô will if we split out the consideration of all previous proposals.\nShortening the voting period will decrease the participation rate among the busy.",

      "content": "Purpose:\n\nAs of 8/20 SharkDao has been closed to new members. The reasons we closed the doors to new members was to establish more comprehensive governance rules and to establish a clear mission to better inform newcomers what it means to acquire community tokens in order to join SharkDAO. To open the door to new members again, and get a better understanding of what ETH/Shark ratio SharkDAO community tokens should be set at in the event that SharkDAO re-opens to new members, we propose to establish a liquidity pool on either Uniswap or Sushiswap. In order to do this, we propose to buy back an allocated number of $SHARK community tokens from current members.\n\nGoals:\n-Have a market-based way to establish a swap ratio for $SHARK community tokens.\n-Allow existing DAO members to have some access to liquidity. Shark members will be able to add more to their stake or sell if they choose.\n-Allow new members to join SharkDAO while we wait for the DAO to reopen JuiceBox.\n-Solve any differences in vision between members by allowing each member the flexibility to do what is best for them at any given time.\n\nExplanation:\nThe DAO uses DAO ETH to acquire $25,000 USD of SHARK from current DAO members to seed a liquidity pool on either Uniswap v3 or Sushiswap.\n\nDetails:\nThe DAO would be a liquidity provider contributing $25,000 in SHARK and $25,000 in ETH to the pool. The DAO would earn revenue from providing liquidity and yield farming rewards if they are ever enacted.\nWe ask for community volunteers to sell their SHARK to the DAO at a price of 456,619 SHARK per ETH. The volunteers would understand that the market price for $SHARK once it becomes freely traded could go much higher or lower than the proposed 456,619 SHARK per ETH price. Future $SHARK minting (price and quantity) on JuiceBox will be decided in a later proposal.\n\nPros of Uniswap v3\n-Concentrated liqudity (allows LP providers to limit IL or increase fee rewards by providing liquidty in a certain range)\n-Uniswap already has a Noun 11/ETH pool. If we add Shark/ETH to Uniswap, this could cement uniswap as the defacto AMM for the Noun ecosystem\n-Uniswap has larger volume and more users than Sushsiwap, giving us more exposure.\n\nCons of Uniswap v3\n-No liquidity mining rewards at the current time.\n\nPros of Sushiswap\n-Potential to be accepted on the Onsen rewards program which would provide extra rewards to yield farmers.\n-Potential to be an NFT friendly platform with the anticipated launch of Shoyu, Sushiswap‚Äôs own NFT platform\n\nCons of SushiSwap\n-No concentrated liquidity for the time being (Trident, Sushiswap‚Äôs concentrated liquidity feature, has no ETA yet).\n-Being accepted into the Onsen rewards program is not guaranteed and could be a long shot.\n\nWhat voting yes to either Uniswap v3 or Sushiswap would do:\n-We would begin the process of acquiring the SHARK from those interested in selling their SHARK and seeding the liquidity pool.\n-We could start taking on new members.\n\nWhat voting no would do:\n-Back to the drawing board for a new proposal for liquidity.\n-The DAO stays closed to new members.",

The budget is for all of the Nouns- if the bidders win 1 auction, we will have less funds for the next auction. We can add to their budget by future proposals.\n\nOur current treasury is at roughly 230 ETH. We should allocate a significant portion of our treasury to bidding on nouns because of strong interest within the DAO and in the general ecosystem.\n\nPros\n\nWe have the opportunity of acquiring Nouns.\n\nCons\n\nWe could want to use these funds for our derivatives projects, and they would no longer be available if we win.\n\nIf demand falls for Nouns, we could be maliciously bid up by other auction participants if bidders do not adjust.\n\nWhat voting YES would do\n\nGrants bidders a budget to bid Nouns #14-25.

      "content": "Purpose:\n\nThis proposal defines the steps a proposal takes to become a snapshot. Currently, anyone can make a snapshot proposal without community discussion, minimum voting times, and quorum.\n\nOur goals:\n\n- Ensure our community has a chance to consider each proposal.\n- Keep processes light, so that anyone passionate about an idea can make a proposal.\n- Make adjustments to this proposal once we learn more about how it works.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThere are three steps to a proposal.\n\nI. Proposal Idea\nII. Discord Proposal\nIII. Snapshot Vote\n\nI) Proposal Idea: You should start discussing with other members to establish interest. One DAO member‚Äôs approval is enough. Yet we recommend that you be thorough and iron out most details.\n\nII) Discord Proposal: In the appropriate Discord channel (currently #üó≥-dao-proposals), you must post the proposal with the proper proposal template that includes:\n\n- Proposal title\n- Proposal purpose\n- Proposal explanation\n- At least one Pro\n- At least one Con\n- What voting YES would do\n- What voting NO would do\n\nYou must create a thread for the Discord proposal so that the community may scrutinize it. This will reveal more pros and cons and allow us to catch any missing sections. This post must be up for at least 24 hours.\n\nIII) Snapshot Proposal: After the 24 hours, if you decide to move forward, you or a fellow supporter will create a snapshot proposal.\n\nThis snapshot proposal's voting window must span at least 48 hour. It must must have an \"abstain\" option. We require a 30% quorum and a majority of voter approval to pass the proposal.\n\nPros:\n\n- Provides a defined pipeline for passing governance proposals.\n- Gives DAO members more time to vote as well as provide their own opinions and feedback.\n\nCons:\n\n- Slower governance means time sensitive issues can‚Äôt be as quickly addressed\n- We can't make any decisions if quorum is consistently missing.\n\nVoting YES would:\n\n- Adopt these proposal rules that future proposals should follow.\n\nVoting NO would:\n\n- Leave our proposal process undefined.",

      "content": "We are a new DAO. We originally said our goal was to acquire nouns in the first nine and we have succeeded. What comes next? We don't know yet, but it doesn't seem right to keep taking on new members and money when we don't yet have a plan on what to do with the money. We have plenty of ETH in the treasury at the moment.\n\nI propose we temporarily limit the onboarding of new members and ETH until we vote on a process for doing so, a governance model, and a plan for what to do with the new ETH. The exact plan for closing the DAO has yet to be decided, but the leading idea is to handle this via Juicebox.\n\nPros:\n-Prevents further dilution of current DAO members' equity in the DAO.\n-We are not in an immediate need of more ETH.\n-We can easily lift the restriction once we figure out a process an procedure for onboarding new capital.\n\nCons:\n-In theory, some potential future members could just join the PartyBid while we figure out our governance model.",
