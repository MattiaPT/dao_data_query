Preamble**\n\nAuthor: Ravi Srivastava, the founder and CEO of Akemona\n\nStatus: Formal Submission\n\nContributors: Akemona team includes members with prior experience developing the Protocol\n\n**2. Summary**\n\nAs the RWA market continues to expand and become more competitive, TrueFi has an opportunity to leverage its existing market-leading Protocol & technology stack with its new governance structure to revitalize its product offerings to attract new lenders, borrowers, and issuers to the Protocol. This proposal is a plan for the TrueFi Foundation and Community to bring on [Akemona Technologies](https://akemona.com/)’ team as TrueFi’s new core product and business development team. We would take the lead on the following roles Mr. Vandy enumerated in [TFIP-19](https://forum.truefi.io/t/tfip-19-truefi-forward-vision-and-operational-expense-request/1861):\n\n“5. Day-to-day website user interface (“UI”) and user experience (“UX”) tech managers\n6\\. Smart contract maintenance\n7\\. New product development from a technology standpoint\n8\\. New product or counterparts liaison specialist”\n\nOur proposed 7-month budget, through the end of Q1 2025, is USD 448,000 (see the itemization at the end of this document), paid out monthly in the form of USD 54,000 in USDC and USD 10,000 in TRU tokens.\n\n**Our offer includes services for items #5 to #8 from TFIP-19 stated above, which will be covered by Ravi Srivastava and Brady Matthews. Akemona can bring in additional staff if needed. As described below Akemona has included the enhancement of the TrueFi platform and protocol with the Akemona platform in this proposal.**\n\n**Further items #5 to #8 from TFIP-19 are high-level descriptions. The Akemona team will make an assessment and add more details to the description of these activities to measure the level of effort required and derive suitable KPIs.**\n\nThere will be quarterly reviews with the Board and Community via the TrueFi Forum to evaluate KPI performance under our engagement. If we’ve satisfactorily met or exceeded our KPIs, then our relationship should automatically extend for an additional 6 months with new KPIs mutually agreed to by Akemona, the Board, and the Community. In this constantly evolving market, long-term engagements are not nimble enough to adapt to new market developments and the needs of the Protocol.\n\n**3. Motivation**\n\n**Why Akemona?** Akemona is building the future of finance as a pioneer in digital securities and RWA tokenization. Founded in 2018, we’ve developed and launched the first regulated funding portal protocol managed by smart contracts in the United States. Akemona [registered with the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany\\&filenum=7-173) in 2018 and received [FINRA membership](https://www.finra.org/about/firms-we-regulate/funding-portals-we-regulate) approval in 2020 under SEC Regulation Crowdfunding (Reg CF). This year Akemona successfully closed three small, tokenized offerings ([Wolfer](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x9866be60dd080568ef2eda3e2293d8a33fb9070c), [PreSend](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x7e593bb183a7a3a65afd94b300fafee89091648b), [Soma](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbdb9a713553dcf010db8abc99e96c1d4f76499aa)) under Reg CF. Subsequently, Akemona enhanced the platform to add tokenization of RWA under SEC Regulations A, D/S, and Investment Companies 1940 Act. Through the expansion of its tokenization protocol (see Akemona wallet addresses at [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8FCF88F1cEb0443DE1d2ACbe1f4a976103A9e63d) and [Polygonscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8FCF88F1cEb0443DE1d2ACbe1f4a976103A9e63d)) which includes [SEC-registered](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=1846771) onchain transfer agent services ([OnchainTA](https://onchainta.com/)), issuance of perks as utility tokens and NFTs, partnership with [ARCA Labs](https://www.arcalabs.com/), and collaboration with the [CAF Bank of Latin America](https://www.caf.com/) for tokenized thematic bonds, Akemona is expanding in the United States capital market. In 2024 Akemona launched a new white-labeled tokenized fundraising platform, which is doing well in the real estate development industry in the United States.\n\nLegacy capital market infrastructure (comprising depositories, exchanges, clearing agencies, and multiple intermediaries) is slow and inefficient, which results in long settlement times with the majority of settlements taking up to 2 days. In addition, most of this infrastructure exists only for publicly traded securities. Private securities issued under SEC exemptions do not have such infrastructure (except newly emerging ATS and transfer agents in the last 5 years). Under the SEC’s exempt offering framework, which includes Regulations CF, D/S, and A, about USD 1.5 trillion is raised each year (Ref: [Capital Raising in the U.S.: An Analysis of Unregistered Offerings Using the Regulation D Exemption, 2009‐2012](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/riskfin/whitepapers/dera-unregistered-offerings-reg-d.pdf), and [Report to Congress on Regulation A / Regulation D Performance, August 2020](https://www.sec.gov/files/report-congress-regulation.pdf)) in the United States. The private capital market is not only larger than the public capital market, but also it is growing at a faster pace. Recognizing this opportunity, Akemona has focused its technology on the tokenization of RWAs under the exempt offering framework of the SEC. Akemona’s tokenization protocol eliminates post-trade processing, speeds up settlement, and reduces the cost of raising capital.\n\nTokenized digital securities can be traded 24x7 and are settled immediately, providing full transparency of trade and pricing. In addition, issuers can issue dividends in the form of NFTs and utility tokens, which investors can redeem through the OnchainTA protocol, which became operational in 2024. The Akemona protocol enables borrowers and issuers to accept investments in any ERC-20 token of their choice (for example, TRU, TUSD, USDC, etc.). The tokenized securities issued by borrowers/issuers through the Akemona protocol have a minimum holding period depending on the regulations under which they are issued. After the holding period, investors may trade tokenized securities peer-to-peer through the whitelist of investors in compliance with the securities acts.\n\nTrueFi is DeFi-centric and while the expertise of Akemona is on the TradFi side, lessons learned will easily carry over to DeFi and enhance the experience. Akemona’s expertise in TradFi complements TrueFi’s focus on DeFi. By leveraging Akemona’s institutional knowledge and proven smart-contract development, the experience from the TradFi world will enhance TrueFi’s DeFi and make the system safer while preserving its open and innovative nature. This collaboration with Akemona enables TrueFi to bridge the gap between traditional and decentralized finance without compromising the core principles of DeFi.\n\n**The Team**\n\n* [Ravi Srivastava, CEO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-sriv/): Ravi conceptualized the Akemona platform as a regulated securities tokenization platform using smart contracts and blockchain technology. Ravi has extensive experience in corporate finance, technology, and the regulatory environment of financial markets. Before founding Akemona, Ravi was with Insurance (Travelers), Private Equity (Trident, Zenith), Healthcare (Kaiser Permanente), Technology (Dell), and Banking (Bank of America, Reserve Bank of India). Ravi Srivastava is based in Orange County, California.\n* [Brady Matthews, CTO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brady-matthews-316529a/): Brady Matthews, a co-founder, developed all the smart contracts for the Akemona and OnchainTA protocols. In addition, he defined the technology architecture of Akemona. He is recognized as the leading expert in blockchain technology in the United States. Brady has over 12 years of experience building complex enterprise applications on a broad range of software frameworks, platforms, and devices. Following agile methods, Brady has led large teams with on-shore and off-shore staffing to deliver high-quality web and mobile applications, scaled for millions of users (Accenture). Brady lives in Dallas, Texas.\n* [Marina Mataraga, Partner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-mataraga-04818a3/): Marina Mataraga, a co-founder, brings inspiration and deep thoughtfulness to our operations. She developed the original requirements of the Akemona smart contracts. Marina has contributed to Akemona on a part-time basis as needed. She is an industry-recognized leader in horizontal integration and problem-solving. Marina has experience in Healthcare, Finance/Banking, Manufacturing, and Retail. Marina has led a globalized product organization of 300+ people with sales and support to multiple customers with accountability to evolving federal regulations (Dell). Marina is based in Texas.\n* Akash Patel, Lead Software Engineer: Akash has been working with Akemona 24x7 since the beginning. He is a highly trusted partner who brings a strong work ethic to software development. Akash stays ahead of the technology curve and makes sure that we have minimal to no technology debt. Akash has a deep understanding of the technology behind Akemona and OnchainTA and what makes it work. Whenever we are making enhancements and changes to the system, Akash provides valuable insights that make our processes better and faster. Akash is based in Gujarat, India.\n* Divangi Barvaliya, Software Engineer: Divangi has contributed to Akemona full-time since the beginning. She distinguishes herself as a very methodical, process-oriented, and focused software engineer. Divangi deeply understands our systems, processes, code base, and business rules. She has implemented most of the business rules in the investor and borrower/issuer portals’ code base. Divangi lives near Toronto in Canada.\n* Engineering Contractors: Akemona has contracted with engineers responsible for the early development of the Protocol. This experience will provide Akemona with the ability to quickly onramp into TrueFi’s tech stack and begin executing the product roadmap efficiently.\n\n**Why TrueFi?** TrueFi has a successful record of making credit more accessible, transparent, and programmable by bringing debt infrastructure onchain. TrueFi has strong brand recognition across the crypto community. Akemona has developed a regulatory-compliant platform for the issuance of tokenized bonds, which TrueFi can leverage through its marketing outreach in the community. Using the Akemona platform, TrueFi is well-positioned to develop new lines of credit (LOC) products, which leverage the efficiency of blockchain technology and lower the cost of capital. Akemona and TrueFi partnership has the potential to position TrueFi to enter the institutional capital market in the United States and across the world.\n\n**4. TrueFi & Akemona Q4 2024 and Q1 2025**\n\n* Protocol enhancement I (Phase 1): The first phase of Akemona’s involvement with TrueFi will be to align with the Board and Community on a refreshed TrueFi product roadmap. The Wallfacer team [proposed a very well-thought-out roadmap on June 6, 2024](https://forum.truefi.io/t/truefi-wallfacer-labs-chapter-3/1708). We propose starting fresh with a Town Hall on October 1, 2024, where the Board, Community, and Akemona team can have an open discussion to whiteboard out proposed protocol improvements. We can begin the conversation with Wallfacer’s proposed improvements and then field additional proposals from the Community, before working with the Board to align on a draft TrueFi Product Roadmap through Q1 2025 for the Community’s consideration.\n* Protocol enhancement II (Phase 2): Enhance the TrueFi website and protocol by integrating the Akemona software to create a TrueFi capability for borrowers/issuers to launch their own debt/equity security tokens for raising onchain funds under SEC Regulation D 506(c)\\* for lenders to make investments under the same regulations. Borrowers will be able to (1) create an offering, (2) accept investments using TRU, (3) if needed, collateralize the assets purchased from the funds raised, (4) pay back the principal and interest/dividends using TRU, (5) reward investors using utility tokens, which investors may exchange for TRU. Lenders will be able to loan funds to the borrowers using TRU. To achieve these goals, Akemona will integrate its white-label tokenization platform with the TrueFi website, so that it works seamlessly with the website. The Akemona tokenization platform manages the entire lifecycle of tokenized assets from issuance to redemption in compliance with SEC regulations. The addition of this capability will enable TrueFi to enter the largest capital market in the world and provide services to borrowers/issuers for a fee.\n\nAkemona will provide “Test-the-Waters” capability to potential borrowers/issuers under SEC Reg CF on the TrueFi website. Under the current SEC regulations, an issuer intending to raise funds under Reg CF may use any platform to reach out to potential investors to record their intent to invest in the issuer’s future tokenized offering. Upon successful completion of the “Test-the-Waters” campaign, an issuer will have a reasonable forecast of how much they expect to raise from their onchain tokenized offering. To achieve success “Test-the-Waters” campaigns require significant outreach and marketing to potential investors. Akemona will bring its experience to guide the regulatory-compliant marketing of tokenized offerings. Potential borrowers/issuers do not have to decide the regulation under which they intend to raise funds before completing a “Test-the-Waters” campaign. Therefore, a “Test-the-Waters” could be a generic campaign.\n\nUpon successful completion of a “Test-the-Waters” campaign, if a borrower/issuer wants to raise funds under Reg D/S by selling tokens to investors, they can do that on the TrueFi website. If the borrower/issuer decides to raise funds under Reg CF, Akemona will make its tokenization platform available to the borrower/issuer at cost, since fundraising under Reg CF requires the offering to be conducted on an SEC-registered funding portal.\n\nBorrowers may use regulations D and CF for issuing long-term debt or lines of credit. Due diligence and underwriting for the issuance of debt could be performed by a debt underwriting company, like, Cicada Partners. For Reg CF, the funding portal is required to perform a reasonable review. However, Cicada Partners could provide additional due diligence on top of the reasonable review for the assessment of risk, which would act as a credit enhancement.\n\nExpanding the TrueFi protocol to Reg CF may present intriguing opportunities. Reg CF tokens are the only tokenized securities that can be traded peer-to-peer among non-accredited investors after the holding period of one year. In addition, non-accredited/small investors from all over the world (excluding countries barred under the OFAC) may invest in Reg CF tokens issued under the laws of the United States. Private companies with scale, e.g., Substack, have been very successful with Reg CF. Real estate investments in the United States through Reg CF for non-accredited/small international investors could potentially offer protection of principal and growth. Similarly, a Reg CF offering could be used to create a whiskey fund, which could offer an excellent risk/return trade-off. Issuers are allowed to raise up to $5 million in 12 months under Reg CF by issuing debt, equity, membership interest, future revenue, and future equity.\n\nTrueFi could charge a fixed fee of USD 5,000 to USD 25,000 from borrowers/issuers who use its services to issue and sell tokenized securities. The fee will depend on the platform services provided to a borrower/issuer. Under the regulations, TrueFi cannot charge a success-based fee or commission (for example 2% of the amount raised on the platform) from potential borrowers/issuers. Similarly, test-the-waters services could be priced at USD 1,000 to USD 1,500 depending on the support needed by a potential borrower/issuer. Potential borrowers/issuers may pay these fees in TRU.\n\n[<img height=\"261\" width=\"624\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/truefi/optimized/1X/ddd5eb5b30a22fb749c1471adb8f8e06dcc9934d_2_624x261.png\" />](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/truefi/original/1X/ddd5eb5b30a22fb749c1471adb8f8e06dcc9934d.png)\n\n\\*Akemona will provide its full suite of software, which includes Regulations D 506(c), 506(b), S, A, CF, and the Investment Companies 1940 Act. Initially, Reg D 506(c) may be most suitable. If necessary and legally feasible, Akemona will provide options to enable the issuance of unregulated or lightly regulated tokens in jurisdictions that allow such issuance.\n\n* Protocol enhancement III (Phase 3): The other area, which may be of interest is the Investment Companies 1940 Act. We would propose to launch a tokenized mutual fund under the Investment Companies Act of 1940 to create a fund that invests in tokens launched under Protocol Enhancement I. Such a fund could allow accredited as well as non-accredited investors to invest in the expanded TrueFi protocol. The sale and distribution of these tokens will be onchain through the protocol. This fund will require registration with the SEC, which is time-consuming. However, it may be possible to partner with some companies that already have funds registered with the SEC to speed up the launch.\n\n**5. Akemona’s Mandate**\n\nWhy use an external technology service provider? By providing a white-label platform Akemona’s regulated offering can help the TrueFi community enter the largest capital market in the United States with its RWA products within 4.5 months.\n\nAudits of Akemona\n\n* Highland Security audited Akemona smart contracts and the code base in September of 2023. No red flags were found. 24 risks were identified in the yellow (low to medium risk) category related to cloud services, network security, and smart contracts. We fixed 20 of those low to medium-risk issues. The remaining items are low priority, and not related to smart contracts.\n* On October 20, 2022, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) initiated an examination of OnchainTA. On December 7, 2022, the SEC identified four deficiencies. We resolved all those deficiencies by June 8, 2023, to the satisfaction of the SEC.\n* On December 22, 2021, the SEC initiated an audit of Akemona. They closed the audit on December 30, 2021, with no comments.\n* On August 17, 2021, FINRA initiated an examination of Akemona. They closed the examination on January 28, 2022, with minor comments.\n\nAkemona’s Mandate. Launch the project at the beginning of October 2024 to deliver a seamlessly integrated SEC-compliant tokenization platform for the issuance of tokens to the TrueFi community by February 15, 2025.\n\n**6. Proposed Roadmap / Statement of Work through Q1 2025**\n\n[<img height=\"500\" width=\"353\" src=\"https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/truefi/optimized/1X/c3ec6bf15f73358e1a77d97635f545cd91b77c23_2_353x500.png\" />](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/business6/uploads/truefi/original/1X/c3ec6bf15f73358e1a77d97635f545cd91b77c23.png)\n\n**Phase 1**\n\n* **Product**\n  * Align on a refreshed TrueFi Product Roadmap through Q1 2025. Based on [Wallfacer’s most recent roadmap](https://forum.truefi.io/t/truefi-wallfacer-labs-chapter-3/1708), these were the proposed initiatives:\n    * Index Vaults & ALOCs\n    * Multichain Expansion\n    * ALOC Dynamic interest curves\n    * UI/UX Improvements\n    * Website Improvements\n    * Community & Governance Improvements\n* **Execution**\n  * KPI: Refresh and finalize TrueFi’s product roadmap on or before October 31, 2024.\n  * KPI: Set and publish monthly KPIs based on the final product roadmap on or before October 31, 2024.\n* **Phase 2**\n  * **Product**\n    * Investor Portal (buy tokens and indicate interest in test-the-waters)\n    * Borrower Portal (launch offerings and test-the-waters campaigns)\n    * Admin Portal (manage offerings and test-the-waters campaigns)\n    * Transfer Agent Portal (This will require TrueFi to form an entity for registration with the SEC. Until then, OnchainTA can provide such services at cost between USD 1,500 and USD 3,000 per year per offering for supporting tokenized securities.)\n    * During the planning exercise, Akemona will obtain feedback for customizations from the community and develop a plan to implement that feedback.\n  * **Execution**\n    * KPI: Investor Portal integrated into a subdomain of TrueFi (e.g., [invest.truefi.io](http://invest.truefi.io/)) for investment in offerings using TrueFi ERC-20 tokens.\n    * KPI: Borrower Portal integrated into a subdomain of TrueFi (e.g., [issue.truefi.io](http://issue.truefi.io/)) to create tokenized offerings in the Investor Portal for investments\n    * KPI: Admin Portal integrated into a subdomain of TrueFi (e.g., [admin.truefi.io](http://admin.truefi.io/)) to manage offerings.\n* **Phase 3** (TBD in conjunction with the Community)\n\n**7. Funding**\n\n**Itemized Budget**\n\n1. **Investor, Borrower/Issuer, and Admin Portals Service Fee**: USD 25,000 per month (includes full support, ongoing maintenance, enhancements, and customization for TrueFi)\n2. **Brady Matthews**: USD 150 per hour, estimated: USD 24,000 per month - smart contract maintenance plus UI/UX of the TrueFi website and other online assets.\n3. **Ravi Srivastava**: 30 hours per week: USD 15,000 per month (includes support for new product and technology leadership and development, technology infrastructure, foundational work, regulatory analysis/compliance, community coordination, joint business development, etc.)\n4. **Total**: USD 64,000 per month (USD 448,000 for 7 months)\n\n**Terms**\n\n1. USD 64,000 is payable at the start of the project.\n2. The remainder is payable monthly on the 1st of each month upon the presentation of an invoice by Akemona.\n\n**Ongoing Budget After the Initial Implementation**\n\n**Investor, Borrower/Issuer, and Admin Portals Service Fee**: USD 15,000 per month (includes full support, ongoing maintenance, enhancements, excludes customizations).\n\n**Customizations to Investor, Borrower/Issuer, and Admin Portals** (if needed outside the regular release schedule): USD 125 per hour.\n\n**Brady Matthews**: USD 150 per hour - smart contract maintenance plus UI/UX of the TrueFi website and other online assets owned by TrueFi (Any effort towards the customization of Investor, Borrower/Issuer, Admin Portals will be excluded from this, and charged under customizations at USD 125 per hour).\n\n**Ravi Srivastava**: USD 125 per hour (includes support for new product and technology leadership, and development, technology infrastructure, foundational work, regulatory analysis/compliance, community coordination, joint business development, etc.)\n\n**Governance Steps**\nAs the proposal does not fall under the simplified governance exemptions, the proposal will require the following steps:\n\n1. Forum Posting: A 72-hour posting period on the forum to allow the community to provide feedback.\n2. Snapshot Vote: A 48-hour Snapshot vote will be conducted with the options: “OK to vote on Tally,” “Not OK to vote on Tally,” and “Abstain.” At least 5% of staked TRU must participate in this Snapshot vote to meet the quorum.\n3. Amendment Period: If the 5% quorum is met, with a majority negative vote, a 72-hour period will follow to allow for any amendments or discussions before the proposal is posted to Tally.\n4. Tally Vote: Otherwise, the proposal will be posted to Tally for the final vote.\n\n​​",

      "title": "[TFIP 20] Discontinuation of Cicada Partners Managed Pools and Services",
      "content": "Background:\nOn April 11, 2024, Cicada Partners proposal to manage credit pools via introduction of borrowers was passed and executed.\n\nSee:\n\n<img height=\"24\" width=\"24\" src=\"https://avatars.discourse-cdn.com/v4/letter/c/bbe5ce/48.png\" /> [\\[TFIP-11\\] Rebuilding a Risk-Managed Crypto-Native Lending Vertical on TrueFi](https://forum.truefi.io/t/tfip-11-rebuilding-a-risk-managed-crypto-native-lending-vertical-on-truefi/1602) [Proposals](https://forum.truefi.io/c/proposals/7)\n\n> Background: As we enter another crypto bull market, the supply of crypto-native lending has radically transformed following the demise of Genesis, Celsius, BlockFi, Babel, Voyager, et al. Lending to crypto trading firms previously accounted for >90% of crypto lending volumes and based on our estimates still accounts for >95% of volumes even when including the recent $800m+ in T-Bills on chain as “lending”. Nascent market infrastructure creates market fragmentation, which drives inefficiency and…\n\nThe goal of this proposal was to help Truefi with TVL by creating pools for borrowers in which to attract lenders to place capital in such pools. Cicada was tasked with the responsibility to source such borrowers.\n\nHowever, gaining traction on this vertical has been slow at best, with total TVL of these pools totalling about 2.2 million USD, with more than 90% of the lending coming from two addresses.\n\nIn the meantime, Truefi DAO has paid:\n\n1.15 million TRU on initiation of this service on April 11th\n1.85 million TRU on Sablier Stream between April 16th and Sep 28th 2024 (about 1.5 million so far paid in the stream)\nAnd\n1 Million TRU paid as a incentive payment for opening 3 borrower pools.\n\nTruefi using about 0.13 USD per token has paid nearly $500,000 of tokens in 4 months for these services, resulting in 2.2 million TVL and sub few thousand dollars of revenue. This has resulted in a fairly disadvantageous economic arrangement for the DAO.\n\nWith other incentives potentially coming with disproportionate payments for work versus results, it is value enhancing to discontinue the services provided by Cicada.\n\nFurther, for the DAO to continue to attempt to create a “crypto-native” trading firm related lending vertical is a losing game. Instead of trying time again (and again) on this among competitors, the DAO should look to expend its resources and strategy elsewhere to showcase the RWA ecosystem.\n\nMacro-Environment for Trading Firm Lending:\nAs also pointed by Cicada in their proposal, summer-late 2022 brought drastic changes to the meteoric rise of the crypto-native-trading-firm lending/borrowing market with defaults and losses affiliated with the likes of Babel (3% loss to the Orthogonal Credit Maple Pool), Blockfi, Celsius, 3AC, Alameda, Blockwater, Invictus, and Orthogonal Trading. With FTX bankruptcy, trading firms that remained solvent/liquid came under significant pressure with funding being recalled across all lenders, while questioning whether leverage can even be used given the post FTX counterparty risk concentrations that would arise to them.\n\nAmong institutions, whale individuals, and projects from that era, can easily point to some within 1 degree of separation who were burned from at least one of these defaults.\n\nFirstly, trust on the under-collateralised or un-collateralised lending evaporated. Any lenders or would be lenders (who have friends who were burned) have more or less refrained from lending unless with trading firms which have long extensive relationships. Even at two years after these events, we see significant reluctance for lenders to lend to newly formed relationships.\n\nSecondly, the largest borrowers who have survived from the previous era, have not come back to lending platforms to borrow – previous borrowers such as Wintermute, Folkvang, Nibbio, Amber, Mgnr, GSR, amongst others. The counterparty risk mismatch with trading partners and lenders have still proven to be a challenge to many firms.\n\nAs such, even looking at Clearpool for example, the TVL for dynamic pools are at around 12 million dollars, with lending/borrowing concentrated among three borrowers; Bastion, Auros, and Portofino (Portofiino are under a lawsuit from Citadel). Maple’s uncollateralized pool has 1 borrower and about only 5 million dollars of TVL.\n\nThe chances of having this kind of lending-borrowing ecosystem succeeding looks bleak for any player, let alone Truefi. There is little downside to pivot now for Truefi. Furthermore, resource expenses to continue down this path of under/un-collateralised lending is very high. In fact, Fasanara with the highest of credit rating from Credora is at 0 TVL despite the pool being launched.\n\nInteroperability is a key word currently within the classic competitors of Truefi. Maple has launched Syrup to add flexibility to its offerings across all of DeFi. Clearpool has create Ozean, a new L2 blockchain designed for RWA which I believe is envisioned to onboard a network of users beyond the Clearpool ecosystem.\n\nThrough one iteration or another, the current borrowers are also or has onboarded with either Clearpool, Idle, and/or Maple. Lenders with any experience are intimately familiar with all of these protocols. Rather than to compete for a limited opportunity set for what is currently a same narrow set of borrowers and lenders, Truefi should seek new pastures, different opportunities, and new partners to increase the utility of the TRU token.\n\nFor everyone’s mutual benefit, it is best to make decisions in a timely manner on what way is forward or to take an alternative path. In this case, in the backdrop of tough product market fit and expensive costs for TVL acquisition it is best for Truefi and Cicada to go down separate paths at this point.\n\n\n\nOn-Chain Tally Actions:\n\nMint 1 TRU as a memorialize the discontinuation of contract.&#x20;\n\n\n\nAdditional 1000 TRU minted to cover Tally Fees.",

      "title": "[TFIP-19] TrueFi Forward Vision and Operational Expense Request ",
      "content": "# Background:\n\nTrueFi was originally an ecosystem built around the stablecoin TUSD as one of the first stablecoins in crypto from the 2017/2018 vintage. In 2020, TrueFi pivoted as an ecosystem to house credit-related vaults and these vaults allowed for borrowers (mainly crypto trading firms) to interact with lenders for stablecoin funds. By 2022 it was one of the largest protocols of its kind with peers like Maple Finance and Clearpool. However, from spring to winter 2022, saw a near annihilation of these credit-linked markets with bankruptcies such as 3AC, Celsius, Babel, Orthogonal, and Alameda/FTX. Many of these have also been tied with strong accusations of fraud and misrepresentation to its now claimants. TrueFi’s active TVL shrank to near zero by early 2023.\n\nSince about September 2023, Truefi (or its vaults) have been used for the following, with a Real World Asset (“RWA”) theme:\n\n* Adapt3r Whitelisted T-Bill Vault (housed at app.archblock.com): 13.5 million USD\n* Kryptonim Whitelisted Credit: 0.5 million USD\n* Gravity Team/Wincent/Fasanara (Cicada related): 2.1 million USD\n\nRevenues that have been generated or collected from the vaults are currently at sub few thousand dollars.\n\nYet, hundreds of thousands of dollars (in fact, millions) of value in stablecoins and Tru tokens have been paid out to develop the vault technology and on efforts to bring users to the platform.\n\nNonetheless, The DAO has an opportunity to take a competitive segment of the RWA market, and we are already excited by the discussions that we have had with service providers. TrueFi has the name, product, and partners to evolve in the right direction.\n\n# Moving Forward - Strategy:\n\nWhile RWA has immense potential in its next iterations to come there are many question marks just how the adoption will look like and more importantly when it will come.\n\nHow to deal with the uncertainty? The first solution is to build and house products that allow for enhancing the user experience with RWA brought on-chain but are also not RWA-exclusive. Before, Truefi was considered a CeDeFi protocol and with loan managers and such, there was a emphasis on the Ce (Centralised) portion, but now for flexibility, there’s much merit to place more emphasis on the De (decentralised) portion.\n\nThe board has thought of plans to create enhanced versions of innovative products that can fit the bill, with manageable costs to build it. As the plans may be materially economically impactful, specific plans are yet to be divulged. Through the onboarded members of the Foundaiton we will construct a more detailed roadmap that will encompass this vision.\n\nWe have already been connecting with strategic investors and partners to curate this roadmap, and the board is keen and open to working with any and new counterparts especially in RWA to find/create ecosystems that can net or potentially can net significant value and utility for TRU holders.\n\nOf course, we need to find ways to revive the community. Forum participants are limited. Discord has been turned off for discussion. Twitter has been at a standstill. We want to revive these and revive the awareness of Truefi to the crypto community.\n\nTreasury of the DAO must also be actively managed as well, as expenses are borne in USD (or stablecoin equivalent) and there is uncertainty of payments with TRU price fluctuations. The current treasury looks to consist mostly of yet to be minted Truefi tokens and gives rise to significant payment premiums potentially paid to counterparts and service providers.\n\n# Next Steps:\n\nStarting on the right footing\n\nThe DAO (and the foundation as a BVI entity) should gain some legal clarity on its activities. What is viewed as grey, white, or black zones would be helpful. Legal advice should be sought for its current state and help set guidelines for future activities. We have already had advice set for some counterparty onboarding (“KYC”) and anti-money laundering procedures.\n\nThe DAO also should seek to get an update of the financial standing both from a historical and current perspective. For example, versus how much of tokens being expended, how much revenue is being collected. There is also looking at how to deal with legacy assets such as funds in vaults potentially.\n\nThe DAO Foundation should also ensure that assets that belong to the DAO and in the name of the Foundation have been properly handed over. These assets include multi-signature wallets and its assets, vault operations, websites and social media channels. These are noted on the following Tally votes:\n\n* Tally | TrueFi | Assignment Agreement between Archblock Inc. and TrueFi Foundation Ltd.\n* Tally | TrueFi | \\[TFIP-7] Decentralize admin and owner rights to smart contracts (Second Attempt)\n\nBut this is not an exhaustive list of items that would need to be audited or be in a handover process of the DAO and in the name of the Foundation.\n\nExpanding headcount and outsourcing for the benefit of DAO stakeholders:\n\nCurrently, there are only the 2 directors, Ferengi and Nathan on the payroll as the Foundation Directors alongside the 2 community moderators. Cicada as a borrower introducer is the only other entity being paid as Wallfacer has not had a 2H 2024 contract passed by vote. Expenses are required for:\n\n* Legal Advice from Outside BVI Counsel\n* On-chain and financial auditing\n* Additional Community or Outreach person\n* Operations and Administrative Coordinator\n* Day to day website user interface (“UI”) and user experience (“UX”) tech managers\n* Smart contract maintenance (could be in conjunction with 5)\n* New product development from technology standpoint\n* New product or counterparts liaison specialist\n* Compliance related personnel (from onboarding service providers, projects, and making sure that the DAO Foundation acts in a compliant manner)\n* Additional directors\n\nOf course, there are significant costs to this to get on the right footing and to start expanding. More details on activities to be pursued are also noted on the budget below.\n\n### Budget – Financial Overview\n\n6 months of operating expenses, covering essential areas like governance, operational costs, and community initiatives. The proposal also includes setting a budget for future expenses and strategic development at an estimated 1,175,000 USD\n\nThe proposed budget will take a ~30% earmark in TRU’s token price at the execution of the proposal before being swapped into stablecoins. This is to consider price fluctuations before the TRU to USDC/USDT conversion.\n\nA multi-signature wallet will be created and owned by the Directors to manage this before we directly manage service provider operational costs through a bank account\n\nAny excess funds will be reported to the DAO at the end of the six months and quarterly reports will be provided to the community\n\n# Next Governance Steps\n\n1. Set up TrueFi Foundation Treasury Wallet (3-out-of-4 multisig) which has been tested by the Board and dedicated community members (0xC03151bAc97F692e5b71Eb49635A624141f7477b)\n\n   &#x9;[@vandynathan](https://www.tally.xyz/u/vandynathan) ( 0xE416dE13e7859Ba860de0DE3563dA1e4e97dbd97)\n   &#x9;[@ferengi](https://www.tally.xyz/u/ferengi) (0x25022f216b97641d396e6Efe68ba45F80AD7A56b)\n   &#x9;[@StrategoHoldings](https://www.tally.xyz/u/strategoholdings) (0x623EeaAe05FB5A4Be01D45613928d4233da80Fd7)\n   &#x9;[@Marcus\\_Leanos](https://www.tally.xyz/u/marcus_leanos) (0x57cD8ecAA060C857B23f9C68853f09dFfC3b7453)\n\n2.

      "title": "[TFIP-16.1] Restoration of gov procedures & reassignment of CANCELLER multi-sig",
      "content": "## [](#p-4518-summary-1)Summary\n\nThis proposal below builds on the previous \\[[TFIP-16](https://forum.truefi.io/t/tfip-16-restoration-of-governance-procedures-and-reassignment-of-canceller-multi-signature-wallet/1781)] maintaining the previously mentioned governance improvements while modifying the technical process of changing the new CANCELLER role. This means both the revocation of the old multisignature and approval of the new one will be completed in one transaction.\n\n## [](#p-4518-abstract-2)Abstract\n\nAs part of the current transition, there is a clear need to (1) reinstate the governance procedures and (2) implement a committed, business, and technically adept group of individuals on the CANCELLER role to ensure no potentially malicious proposals.\n\nThe community has aggregated some candidates including Board members and long-term, aligned community members, to act as new holders of the canceller multi-signature wallet. The following steps will be implemented.\n\n#### [](#p-4518-h-1-maintenance-of-previously-mentioned-governance-amendment-3)1. Maintenance of previously mentioned governance amendment\n\nFirstly, the previous governance amendments mentioned in \\[[TFIP-16](https://forum.truefi.io/t/tfip-16-restoration-of-governance-procedures-and-reassignment-of-canceller-multi-signature-wallet/1781)] will be maintained and implemented to improve the governance process.\n\n> ### Proposal for Governance Restoration\n> **Compliance with Governance Protocols:\n> All forum proposals must follow the TFIP structure, be subject to a 3–5 day discussion period, and include a “For” or “Against” poll.\n> \n> **Enhancing Community Engagement:** Encourage active participation from all community members to improve engagement and decision-making.\n> \n> **Board’s Role in Reviewing Proposals:** As part of the transition of Wallfacer being the core service provider and according to the initial proposal for the Board’s role, the [Foundation](https://medium.com/trust-token/truefi-dao-step-2-announcement-of-dao-foundation-196cc7a5f0e0) will take over the multi-signature wallets connected to the Canceller function. The Board’s role includes reviewing incoming and approved Timelocked proposals for modifications or outright veto.\n> \n> **Neutrality and Conflict of Interest:** DAO Board members are elected by, serve at the pleasure of, and may be terminated by stkTRU holders. The neutrality of the Board’s individual Directors is crucial. Potential conflicts of interest should be disclosed and mitigated promptly. It is likely that service providers may come from the network of current TrueFi participants, mitigating these potential conflicts of interest as seen in the Teragon proposal which disclosed Bastion Trading as an advisor and enabled the Directors to maintain neutrality through an internal Chinese wall [allowing members to voice their singular opinions independently](https://forum.truefi.io/t/malicious-governance-attack-a-call-to-action-to-stop-the-attack-opine-in-the-next-42-hours/1746/37) . Furthermore, Cicada and Wallfacer noted that they would potentially have a conflict of interest regarding the canceller vote on the Teragon on-chain proposal and decided to abstain. Such transparency and community support are essential, aligning with the suggested canceller wallet policy.\n> \n> **Board’s Role in Onboarding and Compliance** The Board primarily supports the governance, legal, and compliance process for the TrueFi protocol, including onboarding new partners. The Board will support the enforcement of the established governance protocols in the future. Additionally, it is suggested that partners should onboard before their proposal goes on-chain to ensure compliance with our required AML laws. This process protects the DAO and limits the need for the Canceller function in the future, as partners will be aligned internally; be able to discuss confidential, commercially sensitive information; and the provision of KYC documents will act as a deterrent to harmful behaviour.\n> \n> **Simplified Governance and Snapshot Utilization** In response to concerns regarding the complexity of governance and the low participation, we propose a more streamlined approach. A middle ground, requiring a longer process using Snapshot for significant developments, while allowing exemptions for renewals and minor adjustments.\n> \n> **1. Termination of Contracts:**\\* Exemption: The termination of a contract proposed by the Board of Directors due to reasons such as legal risks, failure to reach KPIs, and other risks can be exempted from the lengthy Snapshot process to allow for swift action.\n> **2. Status Quo:**\\* Exemption: Renewals of existing agreements or minor adjustments previously mentioned in a TrueFi Improvement Proposal (TIP) can skip the extended Snapshot process.\n> **3. Smaller Treasury Adjustments:**\\* Exemption: Treasury adjustments including swaps of TRU to ETH, WBTC, or stablecoins below 1.5 million USD can skip the extended Snapshot process.For these exempted proposals:\\* A 72-hour voting period on the forum will be required.\\* A forum poll, if deemed necessary, will be conducted.\\* A 72-hour Tally vote will be held.\\*\n> **Proposed Changes for Non-Exempted Proposals:** For proposals not falling under the above exemptions:\\*\n> **1. Forum Posting:**\\* A 72-hour posting period on the forum is required to introduce the proposal.* **2. Snapshot Vote:**\\* A 48-hour Snapshot vote will be conducted with the options: “OK to vote on Tally,” “Not OK to vote on Tally,” and “Abstain.”\n> * At least 5% of staked TRU must participate in this Snapshot vote to meet the quorum.\n> * **3. Amendment Period:**\\* If the 5% quorum is met, with a majority negative vote, a 72-hour period will follow to allow for any amendments or discussions before the proposal is posted to Tally.\n> * **4. Tally Vote:**\\* After the amendment period, the proposal will be posted to Tally for the final vote.\n> * During this time, TrueFi Foundation will ensure the onboarding of the client and proposed business, assuming all other qualifications are met and there are no technical or procedural issues warranting the Canceller’s intervention.\n> * **Clear Definition of the Canceller Role:** It’s vital to define the Canceller role, which reviews approved and Timelocked proposals, with the power to freeze code merges or veto proposals if they are deemed harmful to the protocol or its users.\n> * **Canceller Function Usage** We propose the following criteria for the Canceller function:\n>   1. Any Tally Transaction not referenced in the Truefi Forum (and obviously relevantly referenced) will be cancelled.\n>   2. Any Tally Transaction that is notified to have a legitimate technical flaw will be cancelled.\n>   3. Any Tally Transaction (even if there is a corresponding Forum Proposal) where the Proposed Partner party has not been onboarded (KYC and AML cleared) will be cancelled for transactions where more than 5,000 USD value is being transferred.\n>   4. Any Tally Transaction that does not follow the following procedure will be cancelled:\n>   5. A forum post must be made with the appropriate “\\[TFIP-XX]” prefix in the title with the next sequential number of the TFIP on it. The category of the post must be made to be “Proposal”.\n>   6. The TFIP must be left for 96 hours before a vote on Tally vote is initiated.\n>   7. There must be an announcement by the proposer that the vote would be on Tally by the initial proposer on the forum prior to placing the proposal on Tally.\n>   8. The proposal must include at least a description of each Tally transaction to be submitted.\n>   9. The Tally Transactions must coincide with the description of the Tally Tx on the Proposal.\n>   10. A proposal must also provide the terms and conditions that the DAO can unilaterally terminate its arrangement with the service provider (if it is relevant). Such examples are termination upon not meeting interim KPI metrics.\n>   11. A proposal must also acknowledge that payment streams (Sablier streams) as part of their service contract may be terminated despite the best efforts of the DAO and cancellers, and/or incentive payments proposed via future tally payments are subject for such proposals passed by a quorum and majority votes at that time, even if KPIs were completed. The DAO and Foundation are not responsible for these circumstances.\n>   12. A proposal must provide a procedure for any handing off items at the end of the contract to the DAO (or Foundation) including a timeline.\n>   13. The proposal must have a set of terms and conditions that can be mostly transferred to a legal agreement between TrueFi Foundation Ltd and the counterparty where the contract value is greater than 5,000 USD, with satisfaction to the Board. The Board cannot unreasonably refuse that the terms and conditions are not in such format. An agreement draft may be provided (with NDA) to the TrueFi Foundation if significant parts of the agreement should be private.\n>   14. Extraordinary Discretionary Cancellations: If the Board, each individually, believes that the Forum Proposal was passed through highly divergent economics or control metrics from standard practices, then the Board has the right to use the Canceller function. Either on the forum or on-chain, reasons for the cancellation must be provided by each who has canceled the passed tally vote.If governance rules are not met, the Board must unanimously vote to cancel and will approach the additional cancellers to use their address. If all the rules are followed, but there is still potential harmful activity a canceller believes merits the use of the Canceller function, then cancellers must provide adequate reasoning.\n\n#### [](#p-4518-h-2-creation-of-new-multisignature-wallet-4)2. Creation of new multisignature wallet\n\nRather than each holder of the current wallet transferring their rights to a new wallet, it has been suggested that a completely new wallet should be created. The canceller rights on the old multisignature wallet should be revoked and canceller rights to the new wallet should be approved.\n\nTherefore, the proposed candidates have built a new multisignature wallet that will be 2 persons connected to the Board, and 4 long-time community members:\n\n* [@vandynathan](/u/vandynathan) ( **0xE416dE13e7859Ba860de0DE3563dA1e4e97dbd97**)\n* [@ferengi](/u/ferengi) (0x25022f216b97641d396e6Efe68ba45F80AD7A56b)\n* [@TylerEther](/u/tylerether) (0xc8A69971DAa3C3ADd85Ab0d0AF297515769ddfFC)\n* [@StrategoHoldings](/u/strategoholdings) (0x623EeaAe05FB5A4Be01D45613928d4233da80Fd7)\n* [@Marcus\\_Leanos](/u/marcus_leanos) (0x57cD8ecAA060C857B23f9C68853f09dFfC3b7453)\n* [@cicadasefton](/u/cicadasefton) (0xb6F4542a1Fc32C7Ff69303Cb8ED0Ec4404252119)\n\nMultisignature threshold is 4/6 and can be found here:\n**0x38358B194A863d40677D774823e6Fc922a100471**\n\n#### [](#p-4518-h-3-tally-proposal-for-the-revocation-and-approval-of-canceller-multisignature-wallets-5)3. Tally proposal for the revocation and approval of canceller multisignature wallets\n\nThirdly, a Tally proposal would need to call Timelock’s (“0x4f4AC7a7032A14243aEbDa98Ee04a5D7Fe293d07”) and include two actions:\n\n#### [](#p-4518-a-revoke-role-6)A) Revoke Role:\n\n**This will revoke access on the previous canceller multisignature wallet to canceller rights**\n\nrevokeRole(role, account) function with args:\n\nrevokeRole (“0xfd643c72710c63c0180259aba6b2d05451e3591a24e58b62239378085726f783”,“0x8c8FcA3812c4272756120E207D3ED496A73Bc528”)\n\n#### [](#p-4518-b-grant-role-7)B) Grant Role:\n\n**This will provide access on the new multisignature wallet to canceller rights**\n\ngrantRole(role, account) function with args:\n\ngrantRole(“0xfd643c72710c63c0180259aba6b2d05451e3591a24e58b62239378085726f783”, “0x38358B194A863d40677D774823e6Fc922a100471”)\n\n### [](#p-4518-next-steps-8)Next Steps\n\n* **Implementation:** Upon a successful Forum proposal, the final proposal will be brought to all stkTRU holders for an on-chain vote on Tally. If approved, the necessary actions will be executed automatically with the Canceller role will be transferred to the multi-signature wallet controlled by the Independent Board of Directors and the mentioned individuals.",

The objective is to ensure compliance and better community engagement by adhering to established and proposed procedures.\n\nFrom the initial Forum post, there were no additions to the proposal regarding governance restoration, exempted proposals, the definition of the canceller role, and the function of its usage.&#x20;\n\nHowever, it was suggested that we should maintain having six (6) addresses for security reasons.\n\nTherefore, unless amendments are suggested through the Snapshot vote and amendment period, they shall remain as described in the TFIP-16 proposal.\n\n# Proposed Multi-Signature Wallet Signatories:\n\nBased on the six (6) candidates that came forward, the confirmed multi-signature wallet will have a 4-out-of-6 policy for approvals.\n\n## Community Members:\n\n@TylerEther (0xc8A69971DAa3C3ADd85Ab0d0AF297515769ddfFC)\n@StrategoHoldings (Stratego.eth)\n\n@Marcus\\_Leanos (0x57cD8ecAA060C857B23f9C68853f09dFfC3b7453)\n\n@cicadasefton (0xb6F4542a1Fc32C7Ff69303Cb8ED0Ec4404252119)\n\n## Board of Directors:\n\n@vandynathan (0xCd263ADcD76e4d81CB7EA6Ad32447d2810f37e13)\n\n@ferengi (0x25022f216b97641d396e6Efe68ba45F80AD7A56b)\n\n# Next steps\n\n## Implementation:\n\nIf the on-chain Tally vote passes, the governance process will be re-established as outlined, and the Canceller role will be transferred from the current holders to the Independent Board of Directors and the mentioned individuals.&#x20;\n\nThe onboarding process for partners will also be implemented as described.",

We propose **6m TRU** to be paid upfront, and **6m TRU** to be streamed over the next **30** weeks of work contract.\n\nWe are looking to help TrueFi ship new product offerings and work under TrueFi’s leadership with its contractors & employees.\n\n***The Products we highlight to be injected into TrueFi:***\n\n**Managed Vaults** (Generalized, flexible vaults): Fund managers can launch bespoke vaults.\n\n**Structured Products** (From vanilla to exotics): Starting with basic call and put overwrite strategies and easily extendable to more exotic options.\n\n**Index Products** (MSCI meets TokenSets): Construct market and thematic indices with guidelines derived from MSCI in tradFi.\n\nOur smart contracts, operational workflows, and backend infrastructure are ready to go, with frontend interfaces. Further integration with TrueFi’s ecosystem will be required, and we propose to work for TrueFi for 30 weeks to ensure a smooth transition and handover.\n\nForum thread: <https://forum.truefi.io/t/proposal-for-tech-infusion-support-and-expansion-of-truefi-products/1728>",

Despite doubts hovering over certain CEXs, we still believe maintaining a healthy orderbook and strong liquidity is critical for the TRU token over the long run.\n\nIn light of this, DWF Labs proposes a strategic partnership that leverages DWF Labs’ expertise in market making, liquidity provision, and ecosystem support to enhance TRU token liquidity and Truefi’s market presence.\n\n***DWF Labs’ Background***\nDWF Labs boasts a portfolio of over 700 companies, serving as the market maker for more than 25% of the top 100 companies ranked by CMC and 44% of those within the top 1000. We want to partner with the most visionary entrepreneurs with our goal in assisting all trading related matters while providing a high-touch, dedicated partnership-centric relationship.\n\nOriginating In 2018 as a proprietary high-frequency trading (HFT) firm in Switzerland, DWF was founded by a team of ETH graduates from Zurich and experienced quantitative traders from IMC; leveraging AI, machine learning, and advanced mathematical techniques in the design and implementation of its HFT strategies.\n\nIn 2022, following comprehensive market analysis and opportunity assessment, the company initiated the establishment of DWF Labs. DWF Labs engages in venture investments, secondary market transactions, Over-the-Counter (OTC) activities, and market-making services. DWF Labs’ rapid expansion has positioned the company as a leading entity in trading across spot, perpetuals, and options markets, spanning over 60 reputable centralised and decentralised trading venues.\n\nBeyond these, the firm actively supports the crypto industry by contributing TVL, operating validators across numerous protocols, KOL marketing network, technical testing, smart-contract audit services and fostering the overall growth of its portfolio companies.\n\nToday, DWF Labs’ portfolio is incorporated and tracked by leading crypto sources CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, in response to the public interest in activities undertaken by DWF Labs and its partners – a testament to the firm’s success and influence.\n\n***Value proposition and differentiating factors***\nDWF Labs excels in dynamic prop trading, employing varied strategies in both CeFi and DeFi, including liquidity provisioning in DEXs and CEXs, cross-venue arbitrage, and HFT. We can enhance liquidity for TRU in both spot and perp markets.\n\nBoth DWF Labs and our venture arm oversee a broad portfolio that includes DeFi, gaming/NFTs, infrastructure, consumer applications, and RWAs, which Truefi can tap into to enhance its market presence.\n\nDWF Labs is also a multi-stage investment firm which can potentially provide funding when Truefi team needs in the future.\n\nInstead of asking for both TRU and stable coins, we only ask to borrow TRU tokens and provide stable coins with our own capital, which is more capital efficient for Truefi.\n\nWith a loan and call option model, it ensures that both DWF Labs and Truefi team interests are aligned. Also, it offers Truefi team opportunities to sell TRU tokens to DWF Labs at significantly higher than current spot price in the future with no market impact.\n\n***Proposal***\nUtilising DWF Labs’ market-making expertise, DWF Labs aims to increase the liquidity of TRU across multiple exchanges on different CEXs it is listed on (excluding those serving American users).\n\n* **Token loan amount**: 7,500,000 TRU tokens\n* **Tenure**: 24 months\n* **Yield**: DWF Labs will be providing a 3% annualised interest payable every 4 weeks with stable coins (USDC/USDT)\n* **MM Objectives**:\n* Bid ask spread: 35 bps\n* Depth +/- 2%: Binance 50k USD, Gate/Kucoin 30k USD\n* Trading volume market share: 7.5%\n* SLA: 24/365 95%\n* **European Call options**: there are five call options and each gives DWF Labs the right (not obligation) to purchase 20% of loaned tokens (total 7,500,000 TRU) at the end of 24 months at following strike prices:\n* Call Option 1: DWF Labs has the right to purchase 20% of loaned tokens (1,500,000 TRU) at strike price 1, which has 20% premium to the spot price of the time when DWF Labs receives token loan\n* Call Option 2:DWF Labs has the right to purchase 20% of loaned tokens (1,500,000 TRU) at strike price 2, which has 35% premium to the spot price of the time when DWF Labs receives token loan\n* Call Option 3:DWF Labs has the right to purchase 20% of loaned tokens (1,500,000 TRU) at strike price 3, which has 50% premium to the spot price of the time when DWF Labs receives token loan\n* Call Option 4:DWF Labs has the right to purchase 20% of loaned tokens (1,500,000 TRU) at strike price 4 - which has 150% premium to the spot price of the time when DWF Labs receives token loan\n* Call Option 5:DWF Labs has the right to purchase 20% of loaned tokens (1,500,000 TRU) at strike price 5 - which has 200% premium to the spot price of the time when DWF Labs receives token loan",

      "title": "[Proposal] Payment of 2023 Archblock Invoice (second attempt)",
      "content": "**Summary:**\n\nShould the TrueFi DAO pay Archblock’s invoice for services provided during 2023? The total invoice amount is $272,676.15, and Archblock is requesting to be paid in a combination of 143,750 TUSD, and the remainder in TRU tokens. Paying this invoice aligns with decentralization and community-driven governance of the DAO, as it is now a separate entity from Archblock, and therefore should operate independently.\n\n\n\n**Background & Rationale:**\n\nOn July 27, 2022, TrueFi Foundation Ltd. (acting on behalf of the TrueFi DAO; hereafter referred to as the “DAO”) entered into a services agreement with TrustToken, Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Archblock, Inc.; hereafter referred to as “Archblock”) whereby Archblock would provide services to the DAO on an as-needed and continuing basis in exchange for a service fee consisting of all direct and indirect costs incurred plus a 10% mark-up of such costs. Such services include advice and assistance in compliance, software engineering, design, information technology, customer support, treasury management, credit underwriting, business development, special servicing of loan agreements, and other technical, professional, or general and administrative areas of a non-integral nature.\n\n\n\n**2023 Invoice Breakdown:**\n\n\n\n* <u>Software Engineering Services</u>\n  * Amount: $207,188.02\n  * Description: Such services primarily consisted of smart contract security and verification audits paid for by Archblock on behalf of the DAO.\n\n\n\n* <u>Customer Support Services</u>\n  * Amount: $7,200\n  * Description: Such services consisted of Archblock maintaining and paying for the TrueFi community forum on behalf of the DAO.\n\n\n\n* <u>Business Development Services</u>\n  * Amount: $5,500\n  * Description: Such services consisted of TrueFi community manager payments Archblock facilitated on behalf of the DAO.\n\n\n\n* <u>Non-Integral Support:</u>\n  * Amount: $27,999.39\n  * Description: Such services primarily consisted of Archblock’s payments to independent DAO council members for their role as Directors of the TrueFi Foundation and representing the DAO.\n\n\n\n* <u>10% Mark-up</u>\n  * Amount: $24,788.74\n  * Description: See “Background & Rationale” above for details.\n\n\n\n* **Invoice Total: $272,676.15**\n\n\n\n**Other Costs Not Recharged:**\n\nIn July 2023, Archblock met with representatives from LBank, a world leading cryptocurrency exchange, and negotiated listing of the TRU token for $40,000. This listing directly benefits the DAO by providing increased exposure and liquidity of the TRU token. As a show of good faith and commitment to the DAO’s success, Archblock decided to not charge the DAO for payment of this listing.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Proposal Details:** [<u>https://forum.truefi.io/t/proposal-payment-of-2023-archblock-invoice/1606/7</u>](https://forum.truefi.io/t/proposal-payment-of-2023-archblock-invoice/1606/7)\n\n\n\n**On-chain Actions:** Transfer 143,750 TUSD to Archblock, and mint <u>$128,926.15 + Buffer</u> worth of TRU tokens to [<u>TrueFi Timelock Treasury</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/truefi/treasury) and transfer all to Archblock\n\n\n\n**# of TRU tokens to transfer:** <u>2,000,000</u> (based on current price of $0.1408)\n\n\n\n**Functions included in this proposal:**\n\n\n\nFunction 1: Transfer TUSD to Archblock's Account\n\n\n\nFunction 2: Mint TRU to DAO Timelock\n\n\n\nFunction 3: Transfer TRU to Archblock's Account",

      "title": "[Proposal] Payment of 2023 Archblock Invoice",
      "content": "**Summary:**\n\nShould the TrueFi DAO pay Archblock’s invoice for services provided during 2023? The total invoice amount is $272,676.15, and Archblock has requested to be paid first in USDC to the extent funds are available in the DAO’s treasury, and any remaining amount is to be paid in TRU tokens. Paying this invoice aligns with decentralization and community-driven governance of the DAO, as it is now a separate entity from Archblock, and therefore should operate independently.\n\n\n\n**Background & Rationale:**\n\nOn July 27, 2022, TrueFi Foundation Ltd.

At the time of writing, there is ~40mm TRU staked (~4% of TRU circ. supply).\n\nTo attract more participation, governance could increase TRU emissions to stakers to 5,000 TRU / day.\n\n### Actions:\n\nThis proposal will execute following transactions:\n\n1. Mint 1,850,000 TRU to Timelock\n2. Transfer 1,850,000 TRU from Timelock to Distributor\n\nAdditionally, the owner multisig will set daily distribution rate for stkTRU rewards to 5k TRU per day on contract 0xecfD4F2C07EABdb7b592308732B59713728A957F.\n\nRead more in the [forum discussion](https://forum.truefi.io/t/proposal-increasing-stktru-gov-participation-a-look-to-future-protocol-spending/1579)",

(the “Company”) employee who is no longer with the Company. That employee did not transfer the Snapshot account admin privileges to the Company during the offboarding process.\n\nTherefore, if this proposal passes, the TrueFi DAO should create a new Snaptshot account with admin privileges owned and controlled by the DAO’s multisig: “truefi-dao.eth” 0x8c8FcA3812c4272756120E207D3ED496A73Bc528",

The borrowed capital will serve as a financial bridge to manage this gap. By leveraging these funds, Kryptonim guarantees uninterrupted operations for users and sets the stage for consistent business expansion.\n\nKryptonim, in its strategic efforts to sustain growth and smooth operations, is actively seeking to secure a loan of 10 million USD. Lenders collaborating in this initiative will receive yield based on the curve defined by the Line of Credit parameters. Yield for lenders comes from users paying fees to use Kryptonim.\n\nRead more: [Kryptonim's forum post](https://forum.truefi.io/t/proposal-kryptonim-intent-to-deploy-liquidity-line-of-credit/1516)\n",

The borrowed capital will serve as a financial bridge to manage this gap. By leveraging these funds, Kryptonim guarantees uninterrupted operations for users and sets the stage for consistent business expansion.\n\nKryptonim, in its strategic efforts to sustain growth and smooth operations, is actively seeking to secure a loan of 10 million USD. Lenders collaborating in this initiative will receive yield based on the curve defined by the Line of Credit parameters. Yield for lenders comes from users paying fees to use Kryptonim.\n\nRead more: [Kryptonim's forum post](https://forum.truefi.io/t/proposal-kryptonim-intent-to-deploy-liquidity-line-of-credit/1516)",

      "title": "Proposal for SSA Advisory and Legal Services Invoicing",
      "content": "This proposal appears on TrueFi 's forum and is posted on behalf of Archblock.\n\n### Summary:\nThis proposal details the request for invoicing BUSD, USDC, and Alameda SBP pools for the Special Servicing Agent (the “SSA”) advisory and legal services rendered by Archblock. These services pertain to the ongoing legal pursuit of recovery from defaulted loans.\n\nArchblock proposes a fee of $15,000/month for each lending pool, effective from September 1st, and continuing until the recovery process reaches a resolution. \n\nNote: The invoiced amount per pool would be paid out of recovered funds and would not require a transfer from the DAO treasury.\n\n\n### Background:\nSince 2022, Archblock's SSA team has been diligently working with the following borrowers to ensure maximum recovery from defaulted or restructured loans:\n\n* tfBUSD TrueFi DAO pool ([Link to the Latest Update Shared with TrueFi Community ](https://forum.truefi.io/t/archblock-special-servicing-update/1481?u=pauljang))\n  * Blockwater\n  * NWH/Invictus\n* tfUSDC TrueFi DAO pool\n  * Delt.ai\n* Alameda SBP\n\n|Lending Pool|tfBUSD Pool|tfUSDC Pool|Alameda SBP|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|Original Loan Amount (Principal Only)|$4,437,820|$5,500,000|$7,280,000|\n|Principal Recovered To Date plus Additional Interest Payment from Restructured Loan|$769,433|$1,537,363|$0|\n|Estimated Recovery Based on Latest Developments|TBD|$6,837,856|TBD|\n\n#### Team Composition and Efforts:\n\nThe SSA team, composed of seasoned legal and financial professionals, has dedicated between 50-75 hours on average per month to defaulted/restructured loan recovery efforts. It is anticipated that these focused efforts will remain necessary for the foreseeable future, ensuring maximum recovery from the three borrowing pools.\n\nUp until now, the SSA team has represented the DAO and SBP pool on a pro bono basis. However, given the extended nature of our engagement, it is necessary for Archblock to begin invoicing to ensure that our dedicated SSA team remains in place to further the recovery efforts.\n\n#### Invoicing Proposal:\n\nWe propose a fee of $15,000/month for each lending pool, effective from September 1st, and continuing until the recovery process reaches a resolution.\n\n#### Scope of Work:\n\nBelow are the key tasks the SSA team has been handling since the onset of the first default:\n\nSSA Core Responsibilities:\n\n* Loan Restructuring\n  * Negotiation with borrowers for loan restructuring.\n  * Management of loan and interest repayments.\n  * Active surveillance of borrower financial health.\n* Legal\n * Preparation of necessary documentation for legal proceedings and drafting of material legal documents.\n * Collaboration with external counsel in applicable jurisdictions for local legal representation.\n* Treasury/Forensic Analysis\n * Comprehensive analysis of the flow of funds concerning borrowers' assets and liabilities.\n\nTo provide transparency and regular updates, the SSA team commits to sharing a quarterly or as needed, report with the community. This report will highlight any new recoveries, restructuring, or legal developments associated with the three lending pools.",

      "content": "### Summary\n\nThis proposal would upgrade the SAFU contract at [0x1eA63189eB1F4c109B10Cf6567f328C826AA6151](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1eA63189eB1F4c109B10Cf6567f328C826AA6151) so that liquidation can only be called by the owner role, which is currently set to [multisig 0x16c](https://etherscan.io/address/0x16cEa306506c387713C70b9C1205fd5aC997E78E) and could be passed to DAO governance or another party in the future. \n\n### Background & Rationale\n\nAs is, any address is able to liquidate a loan held by the TrueFi DAO Pools that has defaulted. This liquidation triggers a slashing of up to 10% of stkTRU.\n\nThe only active loan held in the TrueFi DAO pools is the [delt.ai loan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCcdAe6aa60Eb981A45881cdFdA8763f7783c9e53) in the tfUSDC pool. As described in https://forum.truefi.io/t/delt-ai-loan-due-july-8-2023-restructuring-update/1444, TrueTrading has reached a restructuring agreement with delt.ai where 20% of the outstanding principal will be repaid this month and maturity on the remaining will be extended.\n\nTrueTrading plans to airdrop partial interest and principal payments over time, directly to lenders of the tfUSDC pool. Since this airdrop mechanism will operate independently in the tfUSDC pool, it is anticipated that even if lenders are made whole, the on-chain TrueTrading loan at [0xCcdAe6aa60Eb981A45881cdFdA8763f7783c9e53](https://etherscan.io/address/0xCcdAe6aa60Eb981A45881cdFdA8763f7783c9e53) will not be repaid in full.\n\nThis proposal aims to prevent unfair slashing of stkTRU holders in such a case, by restricting SAFU slashing to the owner of the SAFU contract.",

      "content": "Abstract\n\nTo protect the DAO from potential governance attacks, we propose assigning the CANCELLER role to the multisig 0x8c8FcA3812c4272756120E207D3ED496A73Bc528.\n\nFollowing security measures have been undertaken:\n\n - All signers are using hardware wallets\n - Members are geographically dispersed\n - There is a stringent procedure in place for reviewing all proposals, which includes performing reviews and simulations before execution.\n\nMultisig Settings\n\n - Multisig threshold is 3/6.\n\nSigners\n - 2 persons coming from Archblock ecosystem\n - 2 persons connected to Wallfacer\n - 2 long-time community members\n\n\nBackground\n\nAfter the recent Tornado Cash governance attack 2 it seems increasingly important to protect the DAO from a similar scenario. To safeguard TrueFi DAO we propose setting the CANCELLER address in our Governor to 0x8c8FcA3812c4272756120E207D3ED496A73Bc528. The CANCELLER role is already implemented in our Governance as a result of TrueFi using OpenZeppeling’s governance contracts, but it has not previously been set.\n\nWhat CANCELLER can do:\n\n - In case there is a proposal that is faulty or adversarial - canceller can execute a transaction that would render the proposal ineffective.\n\nWhat CANCELLER can’t do:\n\n - Canceller can NOT make any decisions or execute any transactions on behalf of the DAO. Its only power is to CANCEL proposals.\n\nThere is precedent for something like this at major protocols like Curve that have their Emergency DAO (https://dao.curve.fi/emergencymembers) in the case of malicious behavior.\n\nRisks:\n\nIt is worth noting that there are certain scenarios where CANCELLER could actually collude with a black hat hacker to extract value from protocols by delaying “rescue proposals”. As a result, CANCELLER should be treated as a temporary measure until there is more value in the protocol and/or a better solution is found.\n",

      "title": "Refinance Delt.ai Loan",
      "content": "### **Summary:**\nThis proposal seeks community approval for refinancing (1) [the NeoFi Opportunities [IV] Portfolio Loan 1](https://app.truefi.io/beryllium/flexible-portfolio/mainnet/0xa1da4701a99089c9650e6e30359507bad02befc6) and (2) the [USDC TAM Loan](https://app.truefi.io/loans/0x232E0A81c41C0B0999e7b671cb5046BeB808C49F) according to the terms proposed below.  \n\n### **Rationale:**\nIn the NeoFi Opportunities Portfolios, TrueTrading served as a proof-of-concept asset manager, or pilot program, to diversify the reach and capabilities of TrueFi to support new portfolio managers with a variety of businesses representing RWA. To date, these portfolios have created $276,164 in interest for TrueFi lenders. A strong majority of the TrueFi community agreed with this strategy, which is visible in the votes supporting each of the four loans managed by TrueTrading since late 2021 [borrower profile 1](https://app.truefi.io/borrowers/0xC8bD2387DB21aAFdD5235B4f223fd5E2c2815eD4) + [stkTRU votes](https://app.truefi.io/stake). \n\nWe continue to believe diversification away from uncollateralized crypto lending into RWA-backed loans are the future of TrueFi. We expect to introduce a handful of high-quality portfolio manager candidates via forum posts and governance votes in Q1. Here’s a [recent announcement](https://blog.archblock.com/new-era-for-real-world-asset-adoption-archblock-and-adapt3r-form-strategic-partnership-to-bring-531f77851544) that highlights an example of our ongoing efforts to create opportunities for new RWA managers.\n\nOur final loan originated by TrueTrading and funded by the TrueFi USDC pool was to be the last loan of TrueFi funds managed by TrueTrading. However, we need to modify this plan, as the sole borrower within the [NeoFi Opportunities [Pilot IV] Portfolio](https://app.truefi.io/beryllium/flexible-portfolio/mainnet/0xa1da4701a99089c9650e6e30359507bad02befc6), [Delt.ai](https://delt.ai/), has yet to identify alternative funding within the current loan timeframe.\n\nDelt.ai has a healthy business providing fintech software and lending to real-world small-to-medium sized Enterprises in emerging markets. Their business depends on durable capital and has counted on TrueFi to be a source of funds for growth as they work to diversify their capital supply.\n\nTheir first 3 loans totaling $9,977,500 have generated $276,164 in interest for TrueFi lenders. Our credit team has been monitoring their financials on a weekly basis to ensure they are meeting their covenants, and is actively working with them on new terms with additional lender incentives (more on this below), and firmly believes a refinancing will lead to the best outcome for lenders, with good potential for full repayment including interest. \n\n**About Delt.ai**\n\nDelt.ai is a fintech startup based in Mexico City that offers an intelligent corporate credit and spend management solution. A Y Combinator company, Delt.ai offers Mexican entrepreneurs better access to working capital through its intelligent credit lines, corporate credit cards, and digital payouts platform. For more information, visit Delt.ai\n\n**Archblock Update on Q4 performance of Delt.ai:**\nDelt.ai continued to perform well in the fourth quarter of 2022 with healthy increases in capital available to deploy to customers despite some slowing and small contraction of capital deployed in December. Recently signed commercial agreements are expected to return capital deployment back to plan in January. Customer delinquencies remained stable at the 6.65% level and well within the base case underwritten levels for potential loan losses. Delt.ai expects that as growth in deployment reaccelerates both volume growth and delinquencies should improve.\n\n### **Executables:**\nHere is a summary of the terms we have agreed on in principle at this time:\n\n- New loan term of 180 days, from 01/10/23 to 07/09/23\n- New loan interest rate of 14.75% in the first 90 days, and 17.5% in the second 90 days\n- Delt.ai will pay owed interest on the current loan of $166,695, which we intend to airdrop proportionally to lenders via TrueTrading upon receipt of this payment\n- Archblock may negotiate additional benefits, which if available will be passed proportionally to lenders\n\nWe expect to sign a definitive agreement by 1/9/23, and will update the community should any material changes in this plan occur.\n\nAs with all other loans that we have addressed in this post, Archblock will pass through 100% of proceeds proportionally to current USDC lenders, either via standard repayment of the loan or settlement if necessary. Archblock will continue to explore tokenizing any recovered off-chain assets for fully-transparent distribution to lenders wherever possible.\n\nIn order to enable the recommended refinancing and ensure equitable treatment for current lenders and TRU Stakers, the Archblock and TrueFi teams will work together to prepare an on-chain governance proposal for the disabling of deposits, withdrawals, and stkTRU slashing in the current tfUSDC pool. This proposal will be put forth prior to the current 1/24 loan end date.\n\n### **Closing Remarks:**\nFor clarity, if the community does not approve the proposed refinancing, the current USDC pool loan to TrueTrading ($5.5MM due 1/24/22) will be called for default on 1/24/22. While Archblock will continue to work with Delt.ai to refinance the loan at the earliest possible opportunity, we believe that a failure to refinance this loan in the near term would impose a greater risk of losses for USDC lenders.\n",

      "content": "The previous [TFIP-3](https://api.tally.xyz/gov/eip155:1:0x585CcA060422ef1779Fb0Dd710A49e7C49A823C9/proposal/32162870676697832842906159407550040934392672292244122124426900894761065432305) vote did not reach quorum. This on-chain proposal is the second attempt to reach quorum on  TFIP-3. \n\n# Description\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal revokes a deployer wallet’s `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` for these two new contracts:\n\n* [Protocol Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x863461596aB57b91B873b26D4F0a701a9703B9Ca)\n* [Incentives Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB74c97c64d52f8f746efA72CD83D59cDf75F1a98)\n\nThese two new contracts will grant the DAO ultimate responsibility over its ERC20 funds. After this proposal executes, the current Gnosis Safes would be able transfer DAO-owned ERC20 funds to these Treasury contracts.\n\nRevoking the deployer wallet’s role has two consequences:\n\n* removes risk of compromise of the single deployer wallet\n* **confirms with a positive action that the DAO has control over these two Treasury contracts**\n\n## Security\n\nAs these contracts are going to store all of the TrueFi treasury at some point in the future, it is extremely important to make sure they are bullet proof. \n\nContract code had been:\n\n* designed, implemented and deployed by TrueFi Security team\n* formally verified by TrueFi Security team\n* [audited by Zellic](https://github.com/Zellic/publications/blob/master/TrustToken%20Contracts-Tequila%20-%20Zellic%20Audit%20Report.pdf)  \n\n**Do not trust. Verify. It is your responsibility as a voter to make sure new TrueFi DAO treasury is a safe place for DAOs ERC-20 tokens.** \n\n## Motivation\n\nDAO ERC20 funds are currently held by two Gnosis Safes:\n\n* A [Protocol Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x2A5c94f3F00Db7f11D53D1CfbD9AE8A2Bbc7bBf0/balances) that earns protocol fees and can later distribute them\n* An [Incentives Safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x4A10ab6Af3A7d1FEa49aADc99059d581B3fba7E7/balances) that distributes TRU rewards to stakers and liquidity providers\n\nWhile TrueFi places high trust in the current Safe signers, there is currently no mechanism for the DAO to revoke the Safe signers’ privileges in case of disagreement. Formally, these Safes currently act as autonomous owners of the DAO’s ERC20 funds.\n\n## Details\n\nThe new Protocol Treasury and Incentives Treasury [contracts](https://github.com/trusttoken/contracts-tequila/blob/main/DaoTreasury.sol) both have `transfer()` and `approve()` functions that delegate to the ERC20s held by the contracts. These functions can only be called by addresses with the `MANAGER_ROLE`, and only when the contract has not been paused by addresses with the `PAUSER_ROLE`.\n\nThe DAO has already been granted `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` for these Treasury contracts, so this `revokeRole()` is the [RBAC](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control#role-based-access-control) analogue of the `claimOwnership()` from the deprecated `Claimable` design pattern.\n\nAfter this proposal, the DAO will be the only address that is able to grant and revoke `MANAGER_ROLE` and `PAUSER_ROLE` in the Treasury contracts. The `MANAGER_ROLE` is intended to prevent voter fatigue, since it would be cumbersome for DAO voters to micromanage day-to-day funds transfers. The `PAUSER_ROLE` is a fast arbiter to prevent a `MANAGER_ROLE` rugpull if the DAO votes (delayed by a timelock) to revoke an address’s `MANAGER_ROLE`.\n\n## Forum discussion\n[https://forum.truefi.io/t/tfip-3-accept-new-treasury-smart-contracts-to-custody-erc20-tokens/1312](https://forum.truefi.io/t/tfip-3-accept-new-treasury-smart-contracts-to-custody-erc20-tokens/1312)",

      "title": "Change Snapshot Voting Power Strategy",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to change our Snapshot voting power strategy from the sum of balances of both TRU and stkTRU, to using delegated voting power tracked in the stkTRU contract.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThere’s currently a mismatch of voting power between off-chain and on-chain voting.\n\nOur on-chain voting uses a Compound-like governance system with our stkTRU contract tracking voting power. Only people with a stake in the system have voting power, and this insulates us from various governance attacks. This is in contrast to our off-chain voting w/ Snapshot where TRU holders, who may not have a stake in the system, also have voting power. Changing voting power to only stkTRU holders increases security, gives more of a voice to people with a stake in the system, and increases accountability.\n\nThis proposal has a further benefit: delegation. Governance is hard, and complexity rapidly grows as more people and property are added to the system. It can take a lot of time to stay on top of everything, and this can lead to voter exhaustion, apathy, and ill-informed decision-making. Delegation is a great way to combat this.\n\nThere are also some additional benefits of delegation such as securely storing your stkTRU while still easily being able to vote with a delegate wallet.\n\n## Executables\n\nReplace the Snapshot voting strategy with comp-like-votes using the following parameters:\n```\n{\n  \"address\": \"0x23696914ca9737466d8553a2d619948f548ee424\",\n  \"symbol\": \"stkTRU\",\n  \"decimals\": 8\n}\n```\n\n## Closing remarks\n\nIf this proposal passes, make sure to delegate your votes to either yourself or someone else. This can be easily done through [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/eip155:1:0x585CcA060422ef1779Fb0Dd710A49e7C49A823C9).",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nReduce TRU emissions to tfTUSD and tfBUSD due to limited recent activity in these pools. \n\nIf approved, the following changes would be implemented next Monday Oct 24:\n\n1. Decrease tfTUSD emissions from 10,000 TRU/day to 0 TRU/day\n2. Decrease tfBUSD emissions from 40,000 TRU/day to 20,000 TRU/day\n\n## Rationale\n\n* New loans have not been made from either pool since July, and little capital has flowed into these pools over the past several months.\n* In line with the overall objective to reduce TRU emissions, TrueFi should decrease TRU to these pools. TrueFi currently emits 40,000 TRU/day to tfBUSD and 10,000 TRU/day to tfTUSD.\n  * tfTUSD emissions would be reduced to 0 immediately, as there is currently no loan activity in this pool.\n  * tfBUSD emissions would be reduced by 50% to 20,000 TRU/day to start, and then further reduced as outstanding ~$4mm in loans are repaid (assuming no demand for tfBUSD product changes). This gradual decrease serves to compensate lenders who remain in the pool for the life of current outstanding loans.\n\nRead more discussion in the forum [here](https://forum.truefi.io/t/proposal-reduce-emissions-to-tftusd-and-tfbusd-pools/1264/).",

      "title": "Fund independent team to build on TrueFi",
      "content": "### **Summary**\n\nA proposal for independent contributors to provide product and engineering development, business development, and marketing support for the TrueFi protocol, putting forth deliverables and milestones for the next 6 months.\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nOn the back of TrueFi’s progress on progressive decentralization, we are putting forward an initiative to provide continued development for the TrueFi protocol, independent of the corporate entity (TrustToken, Inc.) that contributed to the initial development of TrueFi.\n\nAs a part of this transition, TrustToken has committed to funding the DAO with stablecoins and $TRU tokens in an effort to greatly expand the value of the TrueFi treasury, ahead of the DAO reaching a point of profitability (more on this at a later time with projections).\n\nPer the recent governance measure to [establish & fund the TrueFi Foundation](https://snapshot.org/#/truefigov.eth/proposal/0xb247f24fed72652196201cd62663bfdd5edfe0f9d594e572de2a50876b54c717), TrustToken will be moving $1.7M USDC and 40 million TRU to the DAO treasury.\n\nTrustToken (the corporate entity) will likely share updates about their future product development roadmap, but the TL/DR is that they will be focused on building around the protocol (enabling centralized software for institutional lenders, borrowers, and portfolio managers), and will be less focused on protocol development directly (i.e., smart contract work).\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nWe are a team of 5 TrueFi community members who have helped to build TrueFi and want to continue building TrueFi. Several of us have been here since TrueFi’s inception and all members have played key roles in the protocol’s early formation and growth.\n\n### **Who we are:**\n\n* Ryan Rodenbaugh (forum: @RyanRodenbaugh, [twitter](https://twitter.com/RyanRodenbaugh)): TrueFi community member and head of business development. Previously, Ryan was one of the earliest team members at TrustToken, where he played a key role in the ideation of TrueFi and establishing relationships with many of TrueFi’s partners (borrowers, lenders, other defi protocols, centralized exchanges).\n* Tyler Wallace (forum: @tylerw, [twitter](https://twitter.com/wtylerwallace)): TrueFi community member and customer success lead. Previously, Tyler was product manager of TrueFi within TrustToken and helped launch tfUSDC/tfUSDT pools in summer 2021 and TrueFi Capital Markets in 2022. Tyler also builds analytics covering TrueFi on [Dune](https://dune.com/truefi).\n* Kaimi (forum: @kaimi , [twitter](https://twitter.com/kaimi_eth)) TrueFi community member and product lead. While he prefers to stay pseudonymous, we’ve worked with him for nearly the past year. He’s deeply technical, and leads products for all of our existing and new initiatives. He previously worked at other leading DeFi protocols.\n* Bartek Rutkowski (forum: @barrutko, [twitter](https://twitter.com/barrutko), [Github](https://github.com/barrutko)): TrueFi community member and protocol architecture lead. Bartek has contributed to many of TrueFi’s engineering decisions since the very beginning days and has written or contributed to a large portion of existing TrueFi code.\n* Justyna Broniszewska ([twitter](https://twitter.com/jusbroni), [Github](https://github.com/JustynaBroniszewska)): TrueFi community member and engineering lead. Justyna (an exceptional engineer in her own right) today manages all of our engineering teams and is the reason things ship on time. She is also very involved in the broader Ethereum community as a co-founder of [ETH Warsaw](https://www.ethwarsaw.dev/). \n\nWe are also planning to bring on additional contributions (part-time) such as [Codeknight](https://twitter.com/Rattlecage1).\n\nIn the coming weeks, we will also be sharing JDs for new full-time contributors we seek to hire.\n\n### **What we want to accomplish**\n\nOver the next 6 months, we plan to:\n\n1. Expand TrueFi’s RWA footprint by launching key new products: Create and deploy contracts that enable TrueFi to support deals with multiple tranches. This will help TrueFi create structured deals for RWA originators.\n2. Increase adoption by making TrueFi infrastructure more user-friendly: deploy enhancements that provide (a) [ERC4626](https://erc4626.info/) compatibility for TrueFi portfolios, (b) the ability for the protocol and portfolio managers to charge fees that accrue over time, and (c) the ability for portfolios to lend to other portfolios (fund of funds model). We believe these features can attract more lenders to TrueFi DAO pools and create sustainable fee streams for the protocol.\n3. Build with TRU stakeholders in mind: Deliver the next iteration of TrueFi DAO pools and turn fee streams back on from DAO pools. Grow TrueFi’s economic activity by creating adoption for TrueFi Lines of Credit, starting with the [dYdX borrower pool](https://forums.dydx.community/discussion/6434-proposal-move-the-dydx-borrower-pool-to-truefi). Improve TRU emissions sustainability ([1](https://forum.truefi.io/t/proposal-reduce-tru-farm-rewards-by-30/1200),[2](https://snapshot.org/#/truefigov.eth/proposal/0xd86dda67c35968ff9e1aab2c2b4c279b12d634a70df16d867b7dab50bdf2d5a2)).\n\nYou can find a more detailed version of our product and engineering roadmap [here](https://blog.trusttoken.com/truefi-institutional-upgrade-472e86d21216). In addition to this, we will soon be sharing some tokenomics proposals.\n\n### **Project plan & Budget**\n\nWe are requesting a total of 900,000 USDC and 6,671,875 TRU as total budget for 6 months. This budget would cover team members (our current 5 team members above, plus funding for 2-3 additional full-time external hires, and 1-2 paid part-time contributors) and additional expenses including:\n\n1. Conference budgeting (flight and accommodations)\n2. PR Agency (optional expense, TBD)\n3. Legal costs\n4. Community grants\n5. Gas fees for smart contact development\n\nOur 6 month engagement will start from the moment that our first on-chain proposal on Tally is approved. We propose a payment schedule of 40% at the start of the engagement, with the remainder streamed over the full period of 6 months.\n\nThe external hires (i.e., people who never worked at TrustToken) would include 1 new BD hire and 1-2 new marketing hires.\n\nThis budget includes funding for multiple smaller grants focused on small, discrete tasks such as governance facilitation or tokenomics contributions. Audits are not included in this budget for the reason that we believe large expenses should be approved separately by governance. For large and important “one-time” expenses like code audits, we will expect to request funding from DAO governance separately.\n\nAs the first direct contributors to TrueFi DAO, we expect to play an important role in establishing the processes for onboarding contributors and reporting to governance. We envision that the community of TrueFi DAO contributors will grow significantly over the next 1-2 years to ~25 people, and we plan to identify needs in the ecosystem and help recruit for those needs.\n\n### **Reporting Expectation**\n\nIn an effort to provide the utmost transparency to the community and token holders we will\n\n1. Host monthly town halls\n2. Provide monthly reports detailing how we are tracking against our budgets, revenue goals, and development timelines.\n\n### **Other Details**\n\nAs it stands today, we will not be forming an entity to house these operations (such as BDG Labs:AAVE or Uniswap Foundation:Uniswap), we will be “contracting” directly with the DAO and the TrueFi Foundation. That said, everyone who is planning to contract with the DAO has an existing working relationship and we are planning to work closely together as if we were housed under the roof of one company. We may in the future choose to operate behind an entity (akin to BGD Labs).",

      "title": "Establish & Fund the TrueFi Foundation",
      "content": "Progressive Decentralization of TrueFi to Date\n\nTrueFi was created to become the open-source financial infrastructure for facilitating uncollateralized lending of digital assets. Since its launch in November 2020, the core team has been executing on a progressive decentralization step plan for turning the ownership, control, and future development of the protocol over to the community through the creation of the TrueFi DAO (the “DAO”).\n\nFrom the start, TrueFi has sought to make decisionmaking public and community-driven. TrueFi has explored new ideas in a public Discord (now home to nearly 25,000 members), debated them in a public forum, and polled stkTRU holders on potential next steps via Snapshot. Though primitive, this early governance design has seen dozens of motions proposed and passed by stkTRU holders.\n\nAs the TrueFi protocol has matured, so has its governance process: first, with the migration to on-chain voting and stkTRU delegation 1 in April 2022, and next with the introduction of a DAO-managed TrueFi Foundation in June 2022.\n\nSince the vote to claim ownership of TrueFi’s smart contracts passed with overwhelming support 1, in TrueFi’s first binding on-chain vote, the protocol’s future is now more than ever firmly in the hands of its community.\n\nTo continue moving TrueFi’s decentralization efforts forward, this proposal seeks to approve the transfer of TrueFi’s key assets to DAO control, as well as the formalization and funding of the TrueFi Foundation.\n\nNext Steps: Approving and Funding the TrueFi Foundation\n\nNow, we are excited to (i) propose the formation of the TrueFi Foundation (the “Foundation”) and (ii) finalize the transfer of TrueFi’s assets and intellectual property to the TrueFi DAO.\n\nThe Foundation will be tasked with a very limited set of responsibilities and objectives to help support the continuing decentralization of the protocol, manage all off-chain processes, and support the protocol by effecting the on-chain will of the community. In short, the Foundation will operate with a specific set of enumerated powers and all other responsibilities will be left to the DAO members.\n\nA pure on-chain DAO was initially considered, but due to the uncollateralized nature of the lending activity on the protocol there are simply too many off-chain processes that do not yet have workable on-chain solutions. These include, but are not limited to, credit underwriting, off-chain credit agreements, and pursuing defaults. The TrueFi protocol is greatly positioned to provide these on-chain solutions, so a future where the TrueFi DAO exists solely on-chain is possible.\n\nAs proposed below, the TrueFi DAO will allow the protocol to freely develop and grow under the guidance of DAO members, without relying on the management efforts of the core team or a centralized corporate structure.\n\nProposal Overview\n\nThe TrueFi DAO being proposed today will be a hybrid-DAO that accomplishes two primary objectives:\n\nEstablishes on-chain governance of the open-source smart contracts and code, and\nEstablishes on-chain control of an off-chain entity that is limited to an enumerated set of powers.\nThe TrueFi Foundation is incorporated as a BVI company limited by guarantee without share capital.\n\nEnumerated Powers of the Foundation:\n\nManage off-chain corporate responsibilities.\nContract with DAO-approved service providers.\nAct as the initial administrative agent in TrueFi’s decentralized lending architecture to pursue defaults unless DAO members approve an alternative administrative agent.\n\nMaintain a multisig to veto governance transactions in the timelock for emergency purposes unless DAO members remove this functionality.\nInterim Foundation Board Members: Rafael Cosman 1, Alex de Lorraine 3, and Masahide Hoshi 7. A new slate of directors will be elected by DAO members in the coming months.\n\nTrustToken, Inc. (the “Core Team”) transfers the following assets to the TrueFi DAO:\n\n“TrueFi” and “TRU” trademarks.\nAll TrueFi smart contracts.\nAll TrueFi social channels (Discord, Discourse, Forum, Twitter, etc.).\nTrueFi domains and front ends (www.truefi.io, www.app.truefi.io).\nAll TRU tokens in the Community and Incentive allocations 1 and 40M TRU tokens from the Future Team allocation.\nInitial Budget: Initial funding of $1.7M USDC from the Core Team to cover DAO operating expenses for approximately 6 months, at which point a determination will be made on whether additional funding is required.\n\nTrueFi Foundation Proposal\n\nThe TrueFi Foundation is a fully independent entity incorporated in the BVI as a company limited by guarantee without share capital. The members of the company are known as “guarantee members” who contribute a certain amount of value to the company and, in return, have their liability limited to the amount contributed.\n\nIn order to become a legal member of the TrueFi Foundation, and therefore a member of the TrueFi DAO, a TRU holder must contribute 1 TRU token to the Foundation as their form of guarantee. This action will whitelist their wallet to vote in DAO governance, elect the Foundation’s board of directors, and control the TrueFi protocol’s future. This legal formality should provide all DAO members with limited legal liability up to the amount of their guarantee (1 TRU) and create a safe working environment for the TrueFi community to efficiently develop the protocol without the fear of personal liability being attached to their protocol contributions.\n\nThe current slate of board members will act in an interim capacity until TRU holders have had enough time to formally join the DAO and put their own names forward as potential board members. A total of five (5) board members may be elected in the next election via ranked-choice voting. Two of the newly elected board members will serve 1-year terms and the remaining members will serve 2-year terms.\n\nPowers & Responsibilities of the Board\n\nThe Foundation’s board will have a very limited mandate in the TrueFi ecosystem. They will only have the specifically enumerated powers provided above. All other areas of responsibility and power are reserved for DAO members to effectuate through the TrueFi DAO governance process.\n\nChecks & Balances: the Board Multisig\n\nDAO members may terminate a board member at any time by a successful majority vote (50%). If an attempt to terminate a board member fails, then all subsequent attempts to terminate that board member will have the successful vote threshold increased by 10%, up to a maximum successful threshold of 80%. This may dissuade a governance attack to remove board members.*\n\nThe Foundation’s board of directors will maintain a multisig with the power to veto governance transactions that are in the timelock. This veto power is intended to be used only in emergencies and should provide a necessary signal to DAO members that the proposal may have some critical issues that need to be addressed before it can be implemented.\n\nAfter any successful veto, the board shall publicly explain their decision in the TrueFi Forum. Any board member that votes in the affirmative to veto a governance transaction may be removed through a simple majority vote for a period of two (2) weeks after a successful veto. This increases the feedback loop and should ultimately hold board members accountable for their limited use of the board veto power.\n\nThis system of checks and balances will (i) provide additional security for the TrueFi protocol and (ii) allow the protocol to efficiently scale in a responsible manner, all without introducing a centralized authority that takes ultimate control of the protocol away from DAO members.",

      "title": "Establish & Fund the TrueFi Foundation",
      "content": "Progressive Decentralization of TrueFi to Date\n\nTrueFi was created to become the open-source financial infrastructure for facilitating uncollateralized lending of digital assets. Since its launch in November 2020, the core team has been executing on a progressive decentralization step plan for turning the ownership, control, and future development of the protocol over to the community through the creation of the TrueFi DAO (the “DAO”).\n\nFrom the start, TrueFi has sought to make decisionmaking public and community-driven. TrueFi has explored new ideas in a public Discord (now home to nearly 25,000 members), debated them in a public forum, and polled stkTRU holders on potential next steps via Snapshot. Though primitive, this early governance design has seen dozens of motions proposed and passed by stkTRU holders.\n\nAs the TrueFi protocol has matured, so has its governance process: first, with the migration to on-chain voting and stkTRU delegation 1 in April 2022, and next with the introduction of a DAO-managed TrueFi Foundation in June 2022.\n\nSince the vote to claim ownership of TrueFi’s smart contracts passed with overwhelming support 1, in TrueFi’s first binding on-chain vote, the protocol’s future is now more than ever firmly in the hands of its community.\n\nTo continue moving TrueFi’s decentralization efforts forward, this proposal seeks to approve the transfer of TrueFi’s key assets to DAO control, as well as the formalization and funding of the TrueFi Foundation.\n\nNext Steps: Approving and Funding the TrueFi Foundation\n\nNow, we are excited to (i) propose the formation of the TrueFi Foundation (the “Foundation”) and (ii) finalize the transfer of TrueFi’s assets and intellectual property to the TrueFi DAO.\n\nThe Foundation will be tasked with a very limited set of responsibilities and objectives to help support the continuing decentralization of the protocol, manage all off-chain processes, and support the protocol by effecting the on-chain will of the community. In short, the Foundation will operate with a specific set of enumerated powers and all other responsibilities will be left to the DAO members.\n\nA pure on-chain DAO was initially considered, but due to the uncollateralized nature of the lending activity on the protocol there are simply too many off-chain processes that do not yet have workable on-chain solutions. These include, but are not limited to, credit underwriting, off-chain credit agreements, and pursuing defaults. The TrueFi protocol is greatly positioned to provide these on-chain solutions, so a future where the TrueFi DAO exists solely on-chain is possible.\n\nAs proposed below, the TrueFi DAO will allow the protocol to freely develop and grow under the guidance of DAO members, without relying on the management efforts of the core team or a centralized corporate structure.\n\nProposal Overview\n\nThe TrueFi DAO being proposed today will be a hybrid-DAO that accomplishes two primary objectives:\n\nEstablishes on-chain governance of the open-source smart contracts and code, and\nEstablishes on-chain control of an off-chain entity that is limited to an enumerated set of powers.\nThe TrueFi Foundation is incorporated as a BVI company limited by guarantee without share capital.\n\nEnumerated Powers of the Foundation:\n\nManage off-chain corporate responsibilities.\nContract with DAO-approved service providers.\nAct as the initial administrative agent in TrueFi’s decentralized lending architecture to pursue defaults unless DAO members approve an alternative administrative agent.\n\nMaintain a multisig to veto governance transactions in the timelock for emergency purposes unless DAO members remove this functionality.\nInterim Foundation Board Members: Rafael Cosman 1, Alex de Lorraine 3, and Masahide Hoshi 7. A new slate of directors will be elected by DAO members in the coming months.\n\nTrustToken, Inc. (the “Core Team”) transfers the following assets to the TrueFi DAO:\n\n“TrueFi” and “TRU” trademarks.\nAll TrueFi smart contracts.\nAll TrueFi social channels (Discord, Discourse, Forum, Twitter, etc.).\nTrueFi domains and front ends (www.truefi.io, www.app.truefi.io).\nAll TRU tokens in the Community and Incentive allocations 1 and 40M TRU tokens from the Future Team allocation.\nInitial Budget: Initial funding of $1.7M USDC from the Core Team to cover DAO operating expenses for approximately 6 months, at which point a determination will be made on whether additional funding is required.\n\nTrueFi Foundation Proposal\n\nThe TrueFi Foundation is a fully independent entity incorporated in the BVI as a company limited by guarantee without share capital. The members of the company are known as “guarantee members” who contribute a certain amount of value to the company and, in return, have their liability limited to the amount contributed.\n\nIn order to become a legal member of the TrueFi Foundation, and therefore a member of the TrueFi DAO, a TRU holder must contribute 1 TRU token to the Foundation as their form of guarantee. This action will whitelist their wallet to vote in DAO governance, elect the Foundation’s board of directors, and control the TrueFi protocol’s future. This legal formality should provide all DAO members with limited legal liability up to the amount of their guarantee (1 TRU) and create a safe working environment for the TrueFi community to efficiently develop the protocol without the fear of personal liability being attached to their protocol contributions.\n\nThe current slate of board members will act in an interim capacity until TRU holders have had enough time to formally join the DAO and put their own names forward as potential board members. A total of five (5) board members may be elected in the next election via ranked-choice voting. Two of the newly elected board members will serve 1-year terms and the remaining members will serve 2-year terms.\n\nPowers & Responsibilities of the Board\n\nThe Foundation’s board will have a very limited mandate in the TrueFi ecosystem. They will only have the specifically enumerated powers provided above. All other areas of responsibility and power are reserved for DAO members to effectuate through the TrueFi DAO governance process.\n\nChecks & Balances: the Board Multisig\n\nDAO members may terminate a board member at any time by a successful majority vote (50%). If an attempt to terminate a board member fails, then all subsequent attempts to terminate that board member will have the successful vote threshold increased by 10%, up to a maximum successful threshold of 80%. This may dissuade a governance attack to remove board members.*\n\nThe Foundation’s board of directors will maintain a multisig with the power to veto governance transactions that are in the timelock. This veto power is intended to be used only in emergencies and should provide a necessary signal to DAO members that the proposal may have some critical issues that need to be addressed before it can be implemented.\n\nAfter any successful veto, the board shall publicly explain their decision in the TrueFi Forum. Any board member that votes in the affirmative to veto a governance transaction may be removed through a simple majority vote for a period of two (2) weeks after a successful veto. This increases the feedback loop and should ultimately hold board members accountable for their limited use of the board veto power.\n\nThis system of checks and balances will (i) provide additional security for the TrueFi protocol and (ii) allow the protocol to efficiently scale in a responsible manner, all without introducing a centralized authority that takes ultimate control of the protocol away from DAO members.",

I propose a liquidity pool as a better alternative.\n\nProjected impacts\n\n-The liquidity pool should grow into the high millions, providing a deep secondary market and ensuring people can always sell their tfUSDC.\n\n-Based on the current pool, I project a roughly 0.15% reduction in APY from USDC dilution. Roughly 0.3% of APY is being redirected to the liquidity pool, roughly half of which is USDC and half of which is tfUSDC.\n\n-Increased usability of the liquidity pool should increase fees from trading, which counteracts the APY reduction.",

Executing these transactions will allow the DAO to own these tokens and perform future upgrades for the stkTRU smart contract.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nCurrently the stkTRU and TRU smart contract proxies are owned by a multisig. In order for TrueFi to become truly owned by its users, the DAO needs to own the proxy for these contracts, thus giving governance the capability to upgrade these contracts.\n\n**Summary**\n\nTrueFi uses a smart contract proxy pattern - each contract consists of a proxy (public facing address) and an implementation (actual code). Code from the implementation is loaded into the proxy contract every time someone wants to interact with the smart contract. The proxy owner has the ability to change the implementation contract in order to add new functionality or logic.\n\nIn order to control the smart contract proxies, a function call needs to be made to each liquidity pool proxy address:\n\n**Token Proxies**\n\nTRU: 0x4C19596f5aAfF459fA38B0f7eD92F11AE6543784\nstkTRU: 0x23696914Ca9737466D8553a2d619948f548Ee424\n\nBefore the claimProxyOwnership() function can be called, the previous owner multisig will call the transferProxyOwenrship() function.\n\nIn addition to the proxy ownership for the TRU contract, there is an owner role. The owner is still allowed to mint TRU up to the maximum supply of 1.45 billion. By claiming the owner role in the TRU smart contract, governance will control the ability to mint the remaining 8,870,574 TRU that was previously burned.\n\n**Actions**\n\n1.

      "content": "Summary Proposal\nPrecession has submitted a forum proposal describing our Small Business Receivables Pool 1 10 . We are hereby requesting the TrueFi DAO consider directly funding a ‘super senior’ tranche in the pool. We believe the risk profile of the super senior tranche is sufficiently low, providing a high level of stability for the TrueFi DAO treasury. Such a structure may also be used as a template for future transactions and allow the DAO to capture the benefits of subordination to enhance the collateralization of TUSD using real world assets.\n\nStructure\nWith the TrueFi DAO as a super senior lender, other TrueFi community lenders may also participate and earn an enhanced yield. Subordinate or First-Loss capital will be provided by Precession, which will enhance both the Super Senior and Senior lenders from the TrueFi community. (see diagram below)\n\nEconomics\nWe request a loan in the amount of $7,000,000 at a 5% fixed rate.\n\nAdditional Information: \nhttps://forum.truefi.io/t/request-precession-super-senior-funding-request/997",

      "title": "TFIP-1: Claim Proxy Ownership of Lending Pools",
      "content": "**Abstract**\n\nThis proposal intends for the TrueFi DAO to claim ownership of tfLP liquidity pools in the TrueFi protocol. The goal of this proposal is to extend the decentralization of the protocol.\n\nBy claiming proxy ownership, the DAO will fully control upgrades for these smart contracts. Therefore, the only way to modify the code or logic for these contracts would be through a governance vote on-chain.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe TrueFi protocol includes 4 permissionless pools: tfTUSD, tfUSDC, tfUSDT, tfBUSD. The liquidity in these pools has been controlled by stkTRU votes, but the actual ownership of the smart contracts has been managed by a multisig. In order for these pools to be truly decentralized, control of upgrades to these contracts must be controlled by the TrueFi DAO. Claiming ownership of these contracts allows the DAO to fully own and operate its own liquidity pools.\n\n**Summary**\n\nTrueFi uses a smart contract proxy pattern - each contract consists of a proxy (public facing address) and an implementation (actual code). Code from the implementation is loaded into the proxy contract every time someone wants to interact with the smart contract. The proxy owner has the ability to change the implementation contract in order to add new functionality or logic.\n\nIn order to control the smart contract proxies, a function call needs to be made to each liquidity pool proxy address. Before the claimProxyOwnership() function can be called, the previous owner multisig will call the transferProxyOwenrship() function.",

This vote is to allow a maximum of 12 month loan terms in the DAO Flagship Pools. \n\nhttps://forum.truefi.io/t/manager-borrower-proposal-dao-pool-loan-term-12-24-month/1037\n\nBackground\nAsset Pool managers typically engage with counterparties and originators on a term basis. Such agreements feature transaction terms that may range from 6 months to 5 years or longer. Most transactions have fixed expenses such as legal costs (and opportunity costs) that often make longer transaction terms desirable. Shorter terms such as 6-months may work on some assets, but greatly restrict the available asset universe. Many counterparties are unwilling to participate in short term deals due to the financing risk at maturity.\n\nProposal\nSuggestion for the DAO pool to accommodate longer term loans: 12-month, 18-month, and 24-month term loans would be a welcome addition and allow for a more diversified set of assets.",

      "content": "Author: @hal\n\n**TFIP-1: Claim Proxy Ownership of Lending Pools**\n\n*Abstract*\n\nThis proposal intends for the TrueFi DAO to claim ownership of tfLP liquidity pools in the TrueFi protocol. The goal of this proposal is to extend the decentralization of the protocol.\n\nBy claiming proxy ownership, the DAO will fully control upgrades for these smart contracts. Therefore, the only way to modify the code or logic for these contracts would be through a governance vote on-chain.\n\n*Motivation*\n\nThe TrueFi protocol includes 4 permissionless pools: tfTUSD, tfUSDC, tfUSDT, tfBUSD. The liquidity in these pools has been controlled by stkTRU votes, but the actual ownership of the smart contracts has been managed by a multisig. In order for these pools to be truly decentralized, control of upgrades to these contracts must be controlled by the TrueFi DAO. Claiming ownership of these contracts allows the DAO to fully own and operate its own liquidity pools.\n\n*Summary*\n\nTrueFi uses a smart contract proxy pattern - each contract consists of a proxy (public facing address) and an implementation (actual code). Code from the implementation is loaded into the proxy contract every time someone wants to interact with the smart contract. The proxy owner has the ability to change the implementation contract in order to add new functionality or logic.\n\nIn order to control the smart contract proxies, a function call needs to be made to each liquidity pool proxy address. Before the claimProxyOwnership() function can be called, the previous owner multisig will call the transferProxyOwenrship() function.\n\n*Actions*\n\n1. Call claimProxyOwnership() on 0x97cE06c3e3D027715b2d6C22e67D5096000072E5\n2. Call claimProxyOwnership() on 0x6002b1dcB26E7B1AA797A17551C6F487923299d7\n3. Call claimProxyOwnership() on 0xA991356d261fbaF194463aF6DF8f0464F8f1c742\n4. Call claimProxyOwnership() on 0x1ed460d149d48fa7d91703bf4890f97220c09437",

      "content": "Author: @hal\n\nSummary:\n\nTrueFi DAO governance will use the OpenZeppelin standard Governor smart contracts and Tally front end. Both are industry standards with strong security features. Proposals are created with a set of desired transactions. If a user has enough TRU to meet the proposal threshold of 100,000 stkTRU, the proposal description and transactions are submitted to the Governor. In order for a proposal to pass it needs to meet a minimum quorum vote of 15% of all stkTRU tokens and final approval threshold of 50% of votes cast. If a proposal passes, the transaction is queued in a Timelock smart contract which allows execution after 2 days.\n\nThe three threshold amounts will be initially set by the TrueFi core team upon launch of on-chain governance. These thresholds may be changed later if a proposal is created and it gets passed by stkTRU holders through the governance process outlined above.\n\nGovernor\t0x585CcA060422ef1779Fb0Dd710A49e7C49A823C9\nTimelock\t0x4f4AC7a7032A14243aEbDa98Ee04a5D7Fe293d07\n\nParameters:\n\nProposal Threshold: 100,000 stkTRU\nQuorum Threshold: 15%\nApproval Threshold: 50%\n\nVoting delay: 2 days\nVoting period: 3 days\nTimelock delay: 2 days\n\nProposal:\n\n1.

Approve [Cauris Finance](https://www.caurisfinance.com/) wallet `0x0D670Fb8c5d8B76E61431329DC19\n270D1e40d60C` as a portfolio manager on TrueFi\n2. Feature the first Cauris portfolio on the **TrueFi Lending Marketplace** as an independent portfolio manager\n3. Add lender incentives of 10% in form of TRU to provide an expected gross lender return of 18%. Incentives for lenders will begin at portfolio launch and run through the portfolio’s close after the 6 month term.\n\n##  Details on TRU incentives\n\nWe propose capping the amount of TRU incentives allocated to this pool at 625,000 TRU. With this, lenders can be confident they’ll earn the full 10% boost as long as TRU price stays above $0.16 and the portfolio doesn’t grow beyond a $2mm cap, which we’ve discussed being the possible alternative cap after launching the portfolio at $2mm. Incentives will be paid to lenders after the close of the portfolio using the average TRU price on the final day of the portfolio term to determine the number of TRU rewarded.\n\nIf approved, changes will go into effect once the portfolio is launched on the TrueFi Lending Marketplace.",

These Portfolios will operate separately from the existing tfLP pools and collect fees on loan origination. This proposal aims to designate a Treasury to collect fees and hold them until a decision by DAO members is made on how to utilize these fees.\n\nThe Treasury will be a smart contract that acts as a central collector of fees accrued through the TrueFi protocol. The Treasury will be designed to be compatible with the existing version of TrueFi and future Portfolios. Existing balances in the current Community Treasury wallet will be transferred to the Treasury.\n\nProposal:\n\n1. Designate 0x2a5c94f3f00db7f11d53d1cfbd9ae8a2bbc7bbf0 as the TrueFi Treasury\n2.

If funded, this program will reimburse users who migrate funds by 11/1/21 0:00 UTC as specified by the proposal below.\n\n## Objective:\nReimburse ~90% of gas costs (capped at 50 Gwei) for users who complete each or all of the following migrations:\n- legacy tfTUSD pool → new tfTUSD pool & liquidity gauge\n- existing tfUSDC farm → liquidity gauge\n- existing tfUSDT farm → liquidity gauge\n\n## Budget:\n- Total budget: up to 40,000 TRU (~$20k USD as of posting)\n- TRU tokens to be allocated from the TRU supply’s unallocated incentives\n- Reimbursements are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis for users who migrate by 11/1/21 0:00 UTC\n\n## Program Details:\n- Users who migrate existing tokens to new liquidity gauge and/or the new tfTUSD pool + liquidity gauge receive TRU as reimbursement for gas costs\n- Amount of TRU received based upon flat gas reimbursements per migration, gas prices at time of migration, and TRU and ETH prices at time of migration. See below for details\n\n#### Gas reimbursement amounts per migration (flat rates):\n- 1,470,000 gas per TUSD pool + farm migration\n- 450,000 gas per USDC farm migration\n- 450,000 gas per USDT farm migration\n\n#### Mechanics:\n- Gas will be converted to ETH at the median gas price for the day (UTC time) in which the migration was completed, up to a maximum of 50 Gwei\n- ETH transaction costs will be converted to TRU at the average daily TRU/ETH price on Sushiswap\n- Eligible users: wallets must migrate at least 500 tfTUSD, at least 50 tfUSDC, or at least 50 tfUSDT to receive reimbursement. This aims to avoid overcompensation (e.g. it’s not intended to reimburse someone $100 in TRU for moving $1 worth of tfTUSD).\n- Only 1 migration per token per wallet will be reimbursed (i.e. one wallet moving multiple chunks of tfTUSD only receives one reimbursement)\n- Reimbursements will be distributed to wallets within 7 days of the conclusion of the program at 11/1/21 0:00 UTC\n\n#### References:\nOriginal forum thread: https://forum.truefi.io/t/idea-reimburse-gas-fees-for-migrations/746\n",

The posts will require a description of the borrower, explanation of credit support and use of funds.\n\n-TrustToken will continue to perform the exact same compliance and underwriting process for public and private borrowers, i.e. no change in risk analysis and borrower whitelisting.\n\n-All borrowers will receive a credit score which will be made public and will be used to determine loan parameters including loan amount and interest rate.\n\n-Borrowers who elect private borrowing must be considered high credit quality and achieve a minimum threshold credit score.\n\n-Borrower will be unmasked and made public in the event of default thus reputation continues to remain a critical underwriting parameter.\n\n-Borrowers who elect to borrow privately will be subject to a [~50]bps risk premium in interest rate to account for the additional credit risk\n\n-TrustToken will in the near future attempt to retain an independent third party (i.e. accounting firm) to validate via attestation the borrower’s identity, receipt of required diligence materials and completion of all compliance and underwriting requirements.\n\n",

      "content": "Original authors(s): RDharia\nForum Proposal (Detail):  https://forum.truefi.io/t/proposal-growing-borrower-activity-with-tru-incentives/542\n\nBackground:\nThough TrueFi has recently hit the $100m loans originated milestone, the rate of growth for new loans has slowed. It’s clear from borrower conversations that demand for new loans has reduced proportionally to the rise in interest rates.\n\nAs borrower activity is key to TrueFi’s short term (APYs) and long term (defensive moat) health, this proposal aims to incentivize new borrower applications and make our loans more attractive to existing borrowers.\n\nProposal: \n*Borrower TRU Incentives*\nThe following proposal aims to increase new borrower applications and new loan applications for existing borrowers while maintaining high lender APYs, and cultivating “loyalty” (through TRU token holdings & repayment histories) among borrowers.\n\nThis proposal requests 1m TRU from the TrueFi incentive pool to be allocated to borrowers who borrow the next $100m on TrueFi (see current TRU token allocations [here](https://treasury.trustexplorer.io/TRU)). Details below:\n\n- This incentive program is open to any new or existing borrowers.\nUnder this program, borrowers will receive incentives equal to 1% (100 basis points) of the principal loan amount. For example: $1mm loan would receive 10,000 TRU.\n- TRU Incentive on any one loan cannot exceed a maximum of 40,000 TRU ($4mm principal loan amount).\n- TRU Incentive is sent to the Borrower only upon successful loan repayment.\n- TRU Incentive program will end at the earlier of the next $100mm in funded loans (1mm TRU) or September 30th, 2021.\n- TRU Incentive program subject to early termination if the total ‘cost of debt’ net of TRU incentive is deemed too low based on prevailing market rates.\n\nIf approved, borrower incentives begin on approximately May 20th - at the same time [origination fees are slated to end](https://forum.truefi.io/t/eliminate-origination-fee-for-cut-of-returns-instead/344)).",

Liquid Exit has been used for >7M TUSD worth of withdrawals. The tfTUSD/TUSD Uniswap pool now holds ~$17M in TVL and is the 32nd largest Uniswap pool as of today. This pool enables users to get instant tfTUSD liquidity at lower gas costs, making it helpful for users who want to withdraw small amounts of tfTUSD.\n\nMotivation:\nGiven the improvements above, I argue for reducing incentives to the tfTUSD/TUSD LP farm. I believe we can achieve instant liquidity for tfTUSD holders with much lower incentives in this farm. Lowering incentives for this farm seems to align with sentiment expressed in community discussions: https://forum.truefi.io/t/revised-tokenomics-and-proposed-token-burn/308\n\nSpecification:\nTRU Rewards for the tfUSD/TUSD pool will be reduced from the current rate of 156,690 TRU per day to 15,669 TRU per day.\n\nIf passed, these changes will go into effect on March 15, 2020. The exact timing will be announced through official channels.\n\n\n\n",

Increased TRU staking can lead to more TFI-LP deposits farming TRU, more loans approved and issued, more fees generated for the protocol, and improved security for the TrueFi lending pool. \n\nSpecification\nWe propose that ~100,000 TRU per day (15.4 TRU per block) are rewarded to TRU stakers over the 90 day period following the contract upgrade. \nThis would represent an increase of ~16x from the current average rate (~6,000 TRU per day). After the 90 days, the intent is not to end this incentive distribution, just to formally revisit this decision.\n\nVesting schedules for staking rewards can be revisited post v2 launch.",

This would close the Uniswap TRU/ETH farm, and launch a new farm on Sushiwap to replace it.\n\nThe proposed terms of the new farm are as follows:\n1. End Uniswap farm: TrueFi will end the Uniswap TRU/ETH farm with a week’s notice to LPs. No change to TFI-LP/TUSD farm at this time.\n2. Open Sushiswap Farm: TrueFi will launch a Sushiswap TRU/ETH farm with 20% of the current TRU farm rewards, or approximately 10,108.20 TRU/day.\n\nPoll for the terms of migration proposed in this TIP (17 votes YES; 1 vote NO; 18 total): https://forum.truefi.io/t/proposal-new-tru-farming-incentives-for-sushiswap-lps/219/34\n\nSpecification:\n1.

This should also make it easier for other protocols to adopt the token. Additionally, as TrueFi adds more pools over time, it will be good to have a more standard naming convention that can be used by each pool. \n\nSpecification: Update name on Etherscan and in all marketing materials.

Staking rewards are approximately equal to the APY generated on the loan, in the current high gas environment 11-12% APY on TRU staking with lengthy lockups is often not attractive enough to bring in new stakers.\n\nMotivation:\nThis is limiting the amount & pace at which new loans can be made. Before this issue is more fully addressed in TrueFi V2, we are proposing the below changes to ensure further growth for TrueFi in the short-term.\n\nSpecification:\nThis proposal (if passed) will increase staking rewards by 2.5x and decrease the staked TRU needed for a loan to be approved to 50%\n\n\n",

It does not take into account the term period of the loan. Borrowers are paying the same fees irrespective of term of the loan.\n\nMotivation:\nThe current fee structure is disincentivizing short term loans and is not very nuanced.\n\nSpecification:\nThis proposal (if passed) will add a flat fee of $500 and a variable component to the loan origination fee.\n\n\nVoting Options:\nYes, and set variable rate to 0.125% for 30 days (1.5% annualised)\nYes, and set variable rate to 0.01% for 30 days (1.2% annualised)\nYes, and set variable rate to 0.25% for 30 days (3% annualised)\n\n",
