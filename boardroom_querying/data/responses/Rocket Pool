The hotfix will support enabling Protocol DAO voting going forward.\n\n## Outcome If Positive\nThe Protocol DAO asks the development team to deploy the Houston hotfix and for the Oracle DAO to facilitate the protocol upgrade.\n\n## Outcome If Negative\nThe RPIP-63 Houston hotfix is not approved at this time. The authors will engage with the community to understand why it was not approved and another vote will be raised at a later time.\n\n## Context\nThe Houston hotfix is primarily a bugfix upgrade but includes two components that opens up potential roadmap options. Although further votes are required to actually deliver the roadmap options (example RPIP-62), these components make the options technically possible, in the near term.\n\n**Key required bugfixes:**\n- Fixing legacy minipool finalisation\n- Onchain voting: Prevent abuse of proposals to exit RPL stake\n- Onchain voting: Prevent attacks that allow a proposer’s bond to be stolen\n- Reduce the guardrail on on-chain voting quorum (the exact number is up for discussion)\n\n**Key items that aren’t required bugfixes:**\n- Allow the minimum per-minipool RPL stake to go to zero without causing reverts elsewhere; while this is a bugfix, it’s only needed to enable something similar to RPIP-62\n- Use ETH for the scrub check penalty instead of RPL; this is primarily needed to enable something similar to RPIP-62\n\n## Resources\n[Discussion Thread](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rpip-63-houston-hotfix)",

      "title": "Tokenomics Rework Prelude (RPIP-62)",
      "content": "This proposal aims to improve RPL tokenomics in the short term to unlock protocol growth.\n\n## Outcome If Either Variant Passes\n- The RPL requirement for new minipools will be removed\n- The commission for new minipool contracts will be lowered to 5%\n- Minipool commission structure will change (dynamic commission)\n    - 8 ETH minipools opted into the smoothing pool will receive bonus commission as part of their reward claim \n    - Nodes without an associated RPL stake will be entitled to 10% total commission (e.g. 5% contract + 5% bonus)\n    - Total commission increases linearly with RPL stake up to a maximum of 14% for RPL positions worth at least 10% of borrowed ETH\n    - Contract commission is fixed and acts as a lower bound for total commission. Therefore, existing minipools with higher contract commission will not be affected by this change\n    - Bonus commission will be removed (leaving only the 5% contract commission) with the 5th reward snapshot after Saturn 1\n- The parameter changes will be implemented using pDAO bootstrap mode\n    - The guardian will be instructed to invoke the function at the start of the reward period immediately following the vote\n    - Dynamic commission may not be rolled out at the same time as it requires the implementation of [Reward Tree Spec v10](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/assets/rpip-62/rewards-calculation-spec)\n\n## Outcome If Variant A Passes \n- RPL reward structure will remain the same\n    - Nodes with an RPL stake above 10% of borrowed ETH qualify for RPL issuance rewards\n    - Nodes with an RPL stake of 10-15% of borrowed ETH receive the maximum APY\n    - Marginal RPL staking APY decreases beyond 15%\n\n## Outcome If Variant B Passes\n- RPL reward structure will change \n    - Nodes with an RPL stake of any size qualify for RPL issuance rewards\n    - Nodes with an RPL stake of 0-15% of borrowed ETH receive the maximum APY\n    - Marginal RPL staking APY decreases beyond 15%\n\n## Rationale\nWith the DAO having voted for the Saturn upgrade, the fundamental value of RPL will primarily be based on future megapool TVL. Short term increases in TVL are beneficial for the protocol as long as they can be expected to convert to megapools. On the other hand, as competition emerges and an equivalent or higher yield is accessible without the need to acquire a protocol token, short-term RPL utility is unlikely to continue to significantly support fundamental value. Therefore, node operation is made more attractive by allowing minipool creation without RPL. Contract commission for these new ETH-only minipools is kept less attractive than megapool validators under Saturn 1 to encourage migration once dynamic commission is disabled. In the interest of acting fast, this proposal minimizes smart contract changes. The suggested parameter changes can be enacted immediately after the vote passes and [RPIP-63](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-63) is implemented.\n\n## Context\n- [RPIP-62](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-62)\n- [RPIP-62 Discussion Thread](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rpip-62-tokenomics-rework-prelude/3238)\n- [RPIP-62 Sentiment Poll](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rpip-62-tokenomics-rework-prelude/3238/19)",

It attempts to send the node operator’s share to their withdrawal address and if that fails the entire distribution including sending of rETH share fails. For example, a node operator could set their withdrawal address to a smart contract that doesn’t accept ETH or only accepts it when they are personally initiating the distribution.\nA profit motive for node operators to do this exists when rETH is traded at a discount. Ensuring that everyone can distribute would help support the rETH peg through better arbitrage and better match expectation that anyone can distribute.\n\n## Context\n- [RPIP-57](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-57)\n- [RPIP-57 Discussion Thread](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rpip-57-node-distributor-user-fund-unbundling/3008)\n- [RPIP-57 Discussion Thread - Sentiment Poll](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rpip-57-node-distributor-user-fund-unbundling/3008/4)",

      "title": "RPIP-49 Tokenomics Rework",
      "content": "This vote is to ratify the core RPIP-49 Tokenomics Rework set. This includes the following RPIPs:\n* [RPIP-42: Bond Curves](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-42)\n* [RPIP-43: Megapools](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-43)\n* [RPIP-44: Integrating Execution Layer Triggerable Exits](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-44)\n* [RPIP-46: Universal Adjustable Revenue Split](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-46)\n* [RPIP-47: Enable Forced Delegate Upgrades](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-47)\n* [RPIP-59: Deposit Mechanics](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-59)\n* [RPIP-60: Protocol Upgrade Guardrails](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-60)\n\nNote that [RPIP-49](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-49) is an informational RPIP describing the set and does not need to be ratified. \n\nSeveral items in the set are to be considered flexible until ratified explicitly, rather than ratified alongside the tokenomics rework package as a whole. They are:\n* Saturn 2 Surplus Share Strategy\n* Vote Eligible RPL Targets\n* Deposit Strategy\n* Penalty System\n* When the security council should change node operator commission\n\nEach item is described in more detail in RPIP-49. Any other significant issues the development team identifies that impact their ability to deliver this upgrade may also require future votes.\n\n## Rationale\nThe current structure has contributed significantly to dampening Rocket Pool’s growth. When Node Operators (NOs) are unwilling to take on the required RPL exposure to start minipools, rETH supply is constrained. When NOs are unwilling to top off to get RPL rewards, the premise of RPL’s value capture fails (and can even backfire if NOs opt to exit minipools in order to receive RPL rewards).\n\nThe RPIP-49 rework looks to:\n- separate out the roles in the overall system (especially allowing ETH-only operation and allowing RPL to gain value from total TVL)\n- listen to the market to determine how much value each group should receive\n- increase capital efficiency with smaller bonds\n\n## Outcome If Positive\nThe pDAO asks the development team to begin implementation work on the RPIP-49 Tokenomics Rework set, leading to the Saturn protocol upgrades. The RPIPs contained in the set will be marked with the 'Living' status. \n\nThe outstanding flexible items in the specification will have one or more snapshot votes to ratify their final form, once all of these items are resolved the RPIPs will be set to 'Final' status.\n\n## Outcome If Negative\nThe RPIP-49 Tokenomics Rework set is not approved at this time. The authors suggest a new vote in approximately one month that would include all rework proposals (see context below) that have formal RPIP specifications at that time, but this would be a new governance action.\n\n## Context\n\n### Alternative Rework Proposals\n\nThere are two alternative rework proposals that have mutually exclusive elements. They are:\n* The [1kx proposal](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/1kx-tokenomics-proposal/3119), which retains the RPL collateral requirement and introduces delegated staking.\n* The [ib1gymnast proposal](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/an-alternative-and-simple-tokenomics-proposal/3130), which reduces the RPL bond requirement, uses smaller ETH bonds and maintains the 14% commission.\n\nThese proposals do not yet have formal specifications that are ready for a snapshot vote. Voters should vote against the RPIP-49 rework in this vote if they prefer the direction outlined in one of these proposals.  \n\n### Resources and Debate\n* The [Tokenomics Rework](https://rpl.rehab) page which contains explainers and overview content \n* A [Q&A video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-Q6fQsVBTY) with two of the main authors, courtesy of the Rocket Fuel podcast\n* The rework [sentiment vote](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rpip-49-tokenomics-rework-update-2-sentiment-poll/3136)\n* [Discussion Threads](https://dao.rocketpool.net/tag/tokenomics-rework) including critiques from NodeSet and 1kx.",

Remove compression from the IPFS submission\n\n# Outcome If Vote Passes\nRPIP-52 will go into effect and the oDAO will adopt the new format and process for computing the IPFS CID.\nThe JSON format will continue to be made available until such a time as tooling (Smart Node and external applications) can be adjusted to use the SSZ format.\n\n# Rationale\nThe current 'official' implementation of watchtower uses a compression library prior to calculating the CID which does not produce stable output across versions. While this reduces the size of the files dramatically, it means that the oDAO must use the same version of the same library across all seats, which prevents custom implementations of treegen from being used.\n\nIn order to remove compression, we must either reduce the size of the file, or accept larger storage costs. Switching from JSON to SSZ produces files which are the same size as compressed JSON in their uncompressed state.\n\nSSZ was chosen for its speed, size, and its status as the defacto Ethereum binary format.\n\nFinally, formally defining the format in which the IPFS CID should be calculated makes the Rewards Tree File generation process fully specified from start to finish.\n\n# Context\n- [RPIP-52](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-52)\n- [RPIP-52 Discussion Thread](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rewards-tree-spec-v9/2928)\n- [RPIP-52 Discussion Thread - Sentiment Poll](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rewards-tree-spec-v9/2928/7)",

At the time of this vote, the only pDAO committees within Rocket Pool are the [Grants Management Committee](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-40) and the [Incentive Management Committee](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-20).\n\n## Rationale\n\nCommittee members fill important roles within the Rocket Pool DAO. On a moral level, they deserve to be rewarded for the time and value they are providing to the DAO. On a more practical level, previous committee elections have struggled to find sufficient nominees to both:\n* Offer meaningful choice to the pDAO.\n* Provide a sufficient number of substitute members if a committee member is no longer able to volunteer their time. \n\nA stipend may help to increase the attractiveness of the membership roles and will reward committee members for the value they provide to the Rocket Pool DAO.\n\n## Context\n\n* [RPIP-41](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-41)\n* [RPIP-41 discussion thread](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rpip-41-committee-stipends-forum-vote-active/2824)\n* [RPIP Precursor discussion thread (Dec 2023)](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/discussion-compensation-for-committee-members/2521)\n* [GMC Member Stipend Proposal thread (Sept 2023)](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/proposal-gmc-member-stipend/2203)\n* [Stipends for pDAO Roles thread (Oct 2022)](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/stipends-for-pdao-roles/1134)",

However, bounty proposals require more effort from the community to be successful in their goal. This includes both up-front efforts to make an effective proposal, and ongoing efforts to support bounty hunters that lack deep knowledge of Rocket Pool. The existing bounty framework does not recognize this effort, and the GMC is not explicitly empowered to recognize it absent pDAO input. \n\nIn practice, this change allows the GMC to incentivize any or all of the following:\n* A higher quantity of bounty proposals.\n* A higher quality of bounty proposals.\n* Effective support for bounty hunters lacking some Rocket Pool knowledge. \n\nIf used, these incentives may result in a more effective, consistent, and populous bounty program. \n\n## Context\n\n* [RPIP-39](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-39)\n* [RPIP-39 discussion thread](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rpip-39-bounty-incentives-forum-vote-live/2753)",

Under this rule, the GMC has hit periods where it has been forced to make less informed decisions with fewer committee members present. Other changes make minor improvements to efficiency and fix issues introduced in the last update.\n\n## Outcomes\nIf this passes, it replaces RPIP-26 with RPIP-40, which will make minor changes to how the GMC operates.\n\nPlease read the full RPIP [here](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-40).\n\n## Further context\n* [Forum post with poll](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-updates-proposal/2750)\n* [Previous forum discussion](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/gmc-rpip-18-conflict-of-interest-community-feedback/1959)",

      "content": "RPIP-35 makes Balance and RPL Price submissions time-based. This allows for a predictable time between last price update and reward snapshot, among other benefits.\n\n### Outcome if vote passes\n\nRPIP-35 will be implemented in a future smart contract release\nOnce implemented, the prices and balances oDAO duties will be performed on a consistent and predicable timing.\n\n### Rationale\n\nNodes that have under 10% collateral in terms of RPL staked are not eligible for rewards. This value, called their \"effective stake\", is calculated at the time of the interval's end and is a function of the ETH:RPL ratio, which is reported by the Oracle DAO. This means the last price update prior to the end of the interval determines whether or not a node is above 10% collateral and eligible for rewards at that interval. If a node is not eligible, the owner has until the end of the interval to \"top up\" by staking enough RPL to bring the node back above 10%. The issue here is that this \"top up window\" (the time between the final RPL report and the end of the interval) is somewhat uncertain and fluctuates from interval to interval. One of the more common pain points we see in the community is from people who are close to the 10% mark (or under it) and ask what the window is for the current interval; unfortunately, it's not easy to give them a direct answer due to the way the price and balance reporting periods are currently calculated.\n\nThis change removes the uncertainty associated with this timing by shifting price and balance intervals from a number based on blocks to a number based on seconds, which has parity with the way rewards intervals are calculated today. Essentially it means prices and balances will be reported at the same time each day without exception. It standardizes the timing of both functions to make them easier to predict.\n\n### Context\n[Full RPIP](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-35)\n[Forum thread](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rpip-35-time-based-balance-and-rpl-price-submissions/2419)",

The first is having control over certain parameters which define how\nthe protocol operates. e.g. Enabling or disabling deposits or setting the rate of inflation. The second role is spending\ntreasury funds; A portion of RPL inflation is sent to a contract which the pDAO has the power to spend.\n\nCurrently, the core team is responsible for executing pDAO duties at the behest of the community governance process. For\nexample, the team carries out the monthly IMC and GMC payments as per the governance voted payment schedules. The plan\nwas for this power to reside with the team temporarily until a new power structure is set up to take over these\nresponsibilities.\n\nThe motivation for this proposal is to remove the dependency on the team, making the protocol more decentralised and\ntrustless.\n\n### Context\n[Full RPIP](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-33)\n[Forum thread](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/on-chain-pdao-replacement/1998)",

This vote is to resolve the error both moving forward and retroactively via a one-time transfer.\n\nIn addition, this vote increases the IMC's portion of the inflation split by 16%, which is roughly \"50% of funds that were initially going to the oDAO that now go to the pDAO\". This value was arrived at mostly from a [forum poll](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/justification-for-moving-odao-inflation-to-the-imc/1939/12), but taking a conservative step as a starting point.  \n\n### Context \n- [Forum thread](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/mc-budget-update-proposal/2319)\n- [PR implementing changes](https://github.com/rocket-pool/RPIPs/pull/106/files)",

      "content": "RPIP-28 proposes an additional method of creating a new minipool by depositing ETH and RPL together, which will be possible regardless of the Node's current amount of RPL staked.  \n\n### Outcome if vote passes\n- RPIP-28 will be implemented in a future smart contract release\n- Once implemented, it will be possible to make a minipool deposit when under the \"minimum\" RPL threshold by depositing the ETH and staking (at least) the minimum amount of RPL needed for a single minipool of that type\n  - Note that this new method is in _addition_ to the current method\n\n### Rationale\nIt is currently possible to create a new node to deposit a minipool. In other words, this feature does _not_ change the ability for a Node Operator to create a new minipool - they'll be able to create one for the same amount of ETH and RPL.\n\nThis change instead makes the process more convenient. A handful of folks have said they would have created more minipool(s) if they could've added them to their existing node while being under the minimum.\n\nThis should help us provide more rETH supply, with no significant trade-off.\n\n### Context\n- [Full RPIP](https://rpips.rocketpool.net/RPIPs/RPIP-28)\n- [Forum thread](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/allow-minipool-deposits-while-under-min-rpl/2100)",

      "content": "This vote aims to align RPL reward spend with rETH capacity created.\n\n### Summary\n- RPL rewards will scale differently, with a focus on aligning RPL rewards with supplying rETH\n- It will be possible to withdraw down to 15% borrowed ETH (this threshold is currently 150% of bonded ETH)\n- We will transition to the new states over time (some implementation time, six reward periods of ramping, and fully implementing the withdrawal changes will need a smart contract release)\n- Withdrawing will become a 2-step process where RPL is set to \"withdrawing\" for 28 days before it can be withdrawn\n\n### Rationale\nThe goal is to align the DAO's spending on RPL rewards with the DAO's goals. In particular, we'll continue to send 70% of inflation to Node Operators, but better align it far more with the amount of minted rETH.\n\n_Please_ read the Intro document's [context section](https://github.com/Valdorff/rp-thoughts/tree/main/rpl_staking#context) for a visual representation of spending before and after this change. \n\n### Outcomes if vote passes\n- RPL rewards will scale differently\n  - Adding a minipool will increase RPL rewards (even if you already had enough staked RPL)\n  - Converting an EB16 to two LEB8s will increase rewards (even if you already had enough staked RPL)\n  - You will still need staked RPL value of ≥10% borrowed ETH to get RPL rewards [unchanged]\n  - Staking more RPL will mean more rewards [unchanged], though now without a maximum (note that marginal APR gets lower and lower as more is staked)\n  - Beyond 15% borrowed ETH, additional rewards go up slower and slower\n  - The rewards changes will be phased in slowly over 6 months\n- It will be possible to withdraw down to 15% borrowed ETH\n- RPL withdrawal will become a 2-step process\n  - Set X RPL to \"withdrawing\"; these RPL are no longer eligible for rewards or voting \n  - After 28 days, the RPL may be withdrawn\n  - The new rules will be partially phased in over time, and then fully implemented with the next smart contract release\n  - Note that this will apply to all withdrawals, even ones that would currently be instant\n  - Note that this will not apply to claiming rewards, as that isn't a withdrawal\n- Once the 2-step process is implemented, the current \"28-day withdrawal lock when you stake RPL\" will be removed \n- These changes will apply equally to both existing and new NOs\n\n### Context\n- Intro document [live on Val's rp-thoughts repo](https://github.com/Valdorff/rp-thoughts/tree/main/rpl_staking) or [archived printout in RPIP repo](https://github.com/rocket-pool/RPIPs/blob/main/assets/rpip-30/rpl_staking_readme.pdf) \n- [Forum thread](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/rpl-staking-rework-proposal/2090)\n- [Full RPIP](https://github.com/rocket-pool/RPIPs/blob/main/RPIPs/RPIP-30.md)\n- [Deep dive links](https://github.com/Valdorff/rp-thoughts/tree/main/rpl_staking#what-else-has-been-looked-at-around-this-proposal) (a section within the intro document)",

This is purely a signal; pDAO votes and quorum will not impact the result in any way.\n\nPlease read the full RPIP [here](https://github.com/rocket-pool/RPIPs/blob/main/RPIPs/RPIP-24.md).\nYou can read discussion around this in the [forum thread](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/odao-charter-draft-and-more/1832).\n\nFor reference the oDAO addresses that can vote are:\n- bankless 0x2c6c5809a257ea74a2df6d20aee6119196d4bea0\n- beaconcha.in 0xd7f94c53691afb5a616c6af96e7075c1ffa1d8ee\n- blockchaincapital 0xb13fa6eff52e6db8e9f0f1b60b744a9a9a01425a\n- coinbaseventures+unit410 0x55bf89c8af56414f2114d48764a608019da17d2b\n- consensyscodefi 0xdf590a63b91e8278a9102bee9aafd444f8a4b780\n- cryptomanufaktur 0x1df9a4f9421ae6306bc7b171dff8470640f96e72\n- etherscan 0xaf820bb236fde6f084641c74a4c62fa61d10b293\n- fireeyes 0x9c69e7fce961fd837f99c808ad75ed39a2c549cb\n- gitcoin 0x58fa2ca71c4a37f6b280fc55e04cc8effa68a18a\n- lighthouse 0xc5d291607600044348e5014404cc18394bd1d57d\n- nimbus 0xb3a533098485bede3cb7fa8711af84fe0bb1e0ad\n- rocketpool-1 0x2354628919e1d53d2a69cf700cc53c4093977b94\n- rocketpool-2 0xccbff44e0f0329527feb0167bc8744d7d5aed3e9\n- rocketpool-3 0x16222268bb682aa34ce60c73f4527f30aca1b788\n- rocketpool-t 0x8d074ad69b55dd57da2708306f1c200ae1803359\n- rocketscientists-1 0x9f56f3aeed0e79f0e7612119aca0bab15477cec6\n- sassal 0x8fb569c14b372430f9af8b235940187b449d0dec\n- superphiz 0x751683968fd078341c48b90bc657d6babc2339f7",

As with the rest of RP - the DAO may vote for further changes in the future as it sees fit.\n\nThis vote uses _approval voting_. This means you can vote for one or more options, with each selection getting your full voting power. The intent is for voters to select all choices that they approve of (if multiple), instead of limiting them to their top preference.\n\n### Further Reading\n- Full LEB proposal: [RPIP-8](https://github.com/Valdorff/RPIPs/blob/max_collateral_leb8/RPIPs/RPIP-8.md)\n- [An NO ETH centered proposal, with reasoning](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/max-collateral-for-lebs/1166?u=valdorff)\n- [A protocol ETH centered proposal, with reasoning](https://dao.rocketpool.net/t/an-argument-in-favor-of-protocol-eth/1208)\n- A flat number of ETH per validator is proposed here as a compromise position between the above two",

      "content": "This proposal does two things:\n- Formally introduces components that are already part of our snapshot and voting process (eg, quadratic scaling for power)\n- Provides a structure for how votes MUST flow and how they are RECOMMENDED to flow\n\nThe rough outline is:\n- Proposals must have a post on the forums and demonstrate sufficient community interest (a poll is recommended)\n- Rocket Pool Core team (initially) starts a Snapshot vote that lasts at least 1 week, with 2 preferred\n- Votes require at least a 15% quorum, with a mechanism for quorum reduction if it’s consistently not met so the process doesn’t get stuck\n- Vote power is srqt(effective_RPL_stake) [this is currently implemented with a factor of 0.5; this is considered an inconsequential bug]\n- Voting should use basic voting (For/Against/Abstain), and whichever of For/Against has the most power wins\n  - Voting MAY use other voting types, but doing so has to be in an accepted RPIP. I.e. to do this, a basic vote is required to confirm that “for this particular type of decision, we’ll use an alternative voting method.”\n- RPIP-4 also notes that there is a built-in veto because Snapshot is a signaling mechanism and someone needs to execute on the signal. There is text covering how that veto power should and should not be used.\n",

      "content": "This proposal is to increase the deposit pool limit to 5,000 ETH from the current setting of 2,000 ETH.\n\nIncreasing the deposit pool limit will allow for more efficient and larger deposits by Institutional, DAO, and private whale depositors into the deposit pool.\n\nIncreasing the deposit pool limit does present a small potential reduction risk on the rETH APR but only occurs when the deposit pool has a positive balance. For further calculation on the impact please refer to the attached proposal.\n\nhttps://github.com/rocket-pool/RPIPs/blob/main/RPIPs/RPIP-9.md",
