As such, distributing whatever is remaining between the community and closing up the project seems to be the most logical path forward.",

We propose to reallocate resources to replacing the core game with a fully on-chain experience. This proposal aims to reduce treasury burn, implement a codified deflationary economic model, and enhance product alignment with the DAO and community.\n\nMotivation\nRecent developments have made it clear that we must adopt a different approach to building within the DAO. The Crypto Unicorns core land game, as a hybrid experience, requires ongoing management of traditional servers, live operations infrastructure, as well as ongoing design and product effort. This requires continuous management of both technical infrastructures and in-game economic policy. In contrast, a fully on-chain game operates autonomously, eliminating the need for centralized control and significantly reducing long-term maintenance costs.",

In conversations with the LG team, there is a mutual desire to explore building a burn mechanism based on player-driven, in-game spending activities. The authors proposes that when $CU is used in-game it is burned from supply on a weekly basis.\n\nMotivation\nDeflationary tokenomics are straightforward to understand and can attract more participants to our ecosystem. To date, over 64.8M $RBW (6.48M $CU) has been utilized by players in the game. Linking token deflation to in-game usage naturally reduces the total supply of $CU, aligning with increased activity across our growing ecosystem.",

Support for the project has helped mitigate the closure of Hawku and the problems of choosing good unicorns and lands, and a lot of things have even become more convenient. Now the great migration to a fast and cheap XAI blockchain awaits us, and that will require reworking the server side of the app.\n\nMotivation\n- The app solves many player problems (from quests and gene selection, to jousting tournaments and leaderboards) and increases engagement.\n- The app is stable and evolving along the way.\n- Migrating to the different blockchain requires changing many parts of the application and ensuring stability after the change.\n\nThis proposal extends the grant period for the UniWU.me app to cover the items above.",

      "title": "Migrating RBW and Converting to CU Token",
      "content": "Abstract\nWith the game moving to XAI, we propose the migration of the Rainbow Token (RBW), whose immutable contract is on Polygon, to Crypto Unicorns (CU) tokens on Arbitrum. As part of the migration, RBW will convert to CU on a 10:1 basis. A token migration contract will be made available by April 2024 at the earliest. Staked RBW (sRBW) will be migrated and converted automatically with assistance from the Vault team.\n\nMotivation\nGiven the immutable nature of the RBW’s contract, it's impossible to directly transfer it to Arbitrum when the game migrates to XAI. To move RBW, the token must be bridged from Polygon, introducing an additional layer of complexity that may hinder user onboarding. This migration will:\n\n-Strengthen the Crypto Unicorns brand identity by aligning the primary value token with the overarching name of the game & IP\n-Simplify marketing for CU token by making the association between the game and token more intuitive\n-Streamline the user onboarding process",

This approach aims to enhance the gameplay experience and allows our blockchain team to dedicate their efforts fully to the migration.\n\nMotivation\nThe Shadowcorn collection, with its limited availability, has become a valuable asset in our ecosystem, attracting new users with its straightforward utility of on-chain gameplay and collectibility.\n\nThe transition to XAI promises significant improvements, especially for Twilight Tactics gameplay, which fully operates on-chain. We anticipate that the introduction of ultra-fast, gas-free transactions will increase player engagement beyond what was observed in Season 1.",

By creating a self-sustaining educational ecosystem, this proposal seeks to empower community members with the knowledge and support they need to navigate the cryptocurrency landscape successfully.\n\nIt is imperative to ensure Guardians & Keepers are rewarded to provide upward mobility and discourage any rogue behavior due to the loss of meaningful reward and career trajectory.\n\nMotivation\nGuardians and Keepers derive from a diverse range of individuals to provide guidance and education in this complex field for newcomers. However, we are on the bleeding edge of tech and the availability of reliable and accessible educational resources often falls short. By implementing the Community Support & Community Creator, we can foster a collaborative and decentralized approach to education.",

Additionally, the game currently has no “center” and multiple websites with different looks and feel don’t help that. The concept behind this is to:\n\n- Create a sense of “start here” in the game;\n- Allow for new players to have a landing point where all things in the game expand from; and\n- Increase the ability for the game to have a center point where players expect to see “new stuff” spawn / expand from.\n\nMotivation\nTo increase the sense of “the heart of the game” and to onboard new player easier by pointing them to the starting point, which will be a real starting point provided by the game. Many players don’t know where to start, but with this new “hub land” it is the main landing point of the player experience and can be used as a point where other aspects of the game can spawn from.",

As time is a rare comodity in the crypto space, we think that we need to react now, before it becomes a bigger issue.\n\nMotivation\n\nCUIP-017 proposal, while correctly addressing the community request of increasing the breeding and evolution fees, came with an unfortunately bad balance to UNIM/RBW which in turn caused unim sinking to breeding to reach all time lows in the past 2 weeks. We consider that the best path forward to protect UNIM and set a good foundation for potential growth would be to incentivize breeders to use as many breeding points as possible, especially breeding fully to all 8 breeding points. To incentivize sinking through breeding we propose to change breeding and evolution costs to a more balanced approach.",

This would help attract players that would otherwise have no interest or be put off by a game that involves blockchain in any way. This would also future-proof branding by creating our own game identity that is different from other stigmatized NFT games.

Ultimately, the community shall vote on which game mode will be launched for Team RPG.\n\nLaguna Games launched the Team RPG prototype in Match 3 and Autobattler game modes developed by Altitude Games. The two game modes allow players to participate at different levels - proactive vs. passive playstyles. After ~(5) five weeks of testing, we now ask the players to vote on the game mode that ultimately gets built as the Team RPG.\n\nGoals for the Initiative\n-Set up an open dialogue between the Game Developers and Players, incorporating collaboration and decentralization into the process of game development.\n-Engage community governance participation for a major Crypto Unicorns decision.\n-Introduce a new battle loop to players under the Unicorn Multiverse that interconnects with the core farming loop.\n-Provide a new game loop focused on Unicorn skills and roles.",

      "title": "LVM RBW Changes",
      "content": "Summary\nWe are proposing an increase in the RBW cost for LVM minting.\n\nMotivation\nAfter the RBW emissions reduction, RBW emissions to incentivize staking and LPing sit at 50,625 daily. The RMP sees roughly 65k of daily RBW volume, resulting in a net sink of 3.25k RBW per day. Between breeding and evolving, we typically see 40k RBW sunk each day. From the LVM, we see around 20 land mints per day, resulting in a net sink of 1k RBW. All in all, we are removing ~44K RBW from the supply each day versus the ~50k of RBW inflation.\n\nWith jousting, there is a 10% rake on entries that flow to the treasury. Potions will prove critical to the success in tournaments. The launch of jousting will likely increase breeding/evolution spend as demand for high stat corns picks up too. However, we believe it will not be sufficient. That is why we are proposing to increase the LVM RBW cost in this proposal.",

We have community members advocating for a 5x increase in breeding / evo costs to maximize RBW burn, on the other hand we have community members saying this will hurt new players far too much. A solution to appease both camps is to implement a dynamic breeding fee based on the amount of breeding points unicorns have remaining, similar to how UNIM breeding costs are calculated. As the unicorn population grows, so too does the total amount of UNIM emitted each day. Therefore, we have come up with different scenarios in an effort to address every community member’s concerns.",

Only 95 wallets (13.46%) voted against the proposal, while 611 wallets (85.54%) voted in favor of the proposal. Given that the majority of DAO members support reducing staking emissions, we felt it was necessary to reopen the dialogue on reducing the staking emissions.\n\nMotivation\nAfter reading through the forum and Discord discussions we have modified the original proposal in the hopes of alleviating some community concerns with CUIP-015.

      "content": "## Summary\n\nThe product team would like to revamp the meta around the poop collection. This will be done by introducing poop scrolls as one of the possible rewards when collecting unicorn poop in the farming game loop. There are two paths at which we can integrate the poop scrolls into the meta, but either paths ultimately allow for a more engaging experience around the poop collection feature while also enabling us to achieve product-specific goals.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIntroducing poop scrolls into the poop collection feature is expected to achieve the following:\n\n* Add an extra incentive for players to log in to the game daily\n* Add an extra layer of fun by implement an engaging mini-game\n* Add an additional lever that works to decrease seed output from poop collection\n* Add an extra variable to the economic depth of the game",

We propose to implement a quadratic voting strategy for all multi-choice votes on Snapshot. Implementing a quadratic voting system for multi-choice votes is expected to open the discussions to a wider audience by allowing voters to express how strongly they support the choices, by balancing the voting powers, and by allowing representation for all community members.\n\nMotivation\nWe believe that it is important for all stakeholders to have access to a mechanism that will best signal their preferences and how strongly they feel about them. We hope to:\n-Install a system that better represents individual stakeholder participation\n-Introduce a mechanism that allows players to choose more than one option in proposals with multiple choices\n-Give players access to a mechanism that allows them to express how strongly they feel about the choices they’re making",

      "content": "Abstract\nStaking is a mechanism in the nascent web3 industry that incentivizes holding behavior and encourages voting participation. Early iterations of staking mechanisms have an inherent flaw in that they incentivize passive staking vs. active participation. In Crypto Unicorns, staking RBW and voting allows players to participate in making decisions that affect the future of the IP.\n\nWe believe that active players are in the best position to signal our direction as a DAO. We plan to be the first in the industry to create a more aligned staking experience by incentivizing active community and game participation via an innovative badge system. This badge system will enable active players to increase their timelock-based sRBW multiplier for higher staking rewards vs. passive stakers. To apply all this, we need to migrate to a new staking contract.\n\nMotivation\nWe believe in incentivizing active players with higher rewards\nWe believe in empowering active players to participate in governance",

This platform presents a number of problems and challenges that this proposal seeks to address:\n\n1. OS allows the listing of Crypto Unicorns and Lands that are currently locked into the game.\n2. OS updates meta-data infrequently, leading to the possibility of purchasing a Unicorn or Land that has material different from how it is described in the listing.\n3. OpenSea currently requires that the Unicorns market and Land market be separate “marketplaces”.\n4. OpenSea takes 2.5% of all purchases, taking the value out of the CU meta-verse.",

This council will take over from the Laguna Games team and be initially responsible for determining which Draft Proposals make it to an official Snapshot vote.\n\nMotivation\nThe Crypto Unicorns DAO is an experiment in progressive decentralization. We are just a few months into a multi-year process of distributing ownership to active participants. The creation of the governance council will remove Laguna Games as the gatekeeper to proposals being sent to Snapshot for an official DAO vote. Leveraging a council of active community members will ensure that the community has a voice today while preparing for a future when the community takes over the majority of voting power.\n\nDetails\nhttps://forum.cryptounicorns.fun/t/dao-operations-governance-council-installation-live/4952",
