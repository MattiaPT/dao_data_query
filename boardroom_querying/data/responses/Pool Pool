      "title": "PTIP-87 Winding down the POOL pool Snapshot",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\nThis proposal winds down the gasless voting setup of the [POOL pool Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/poolpool.pooltogether.eth) due to low engagement and potential future risk.\n\nThe proposal outlines specific steps to wind down the Snapshot, including removing delegation, restricting proposal creation, and removing pPOOL mentions from the PoolTogether platforms.\n\n## Motivation\n\nHistorically the POOL pool acted as a gasless voting mechanism for POOL holders. It also dripped additional POOL rewards to depositors in the past. Both of this is not true anymore.\n\nThe POOL pool Snapshot has very low engagement and creates unnecessary processes that complicates onchain governance.\n\nReasons for winding it down:\n- The Snapshot hasn’t reached Quorum (20%) since March 2022\n- There isn’t much demand for gasless voting as gas prices are reasonable\n- It creates unnecessary friction for onchain governance\n- It relies on humans to execute the vote\n- The POOL pool rewards have ended and are unlikely to start again\n- The pool has halved in deposits since its ATH (from 1.02m down to 519k POOL)\n- A vote is easy to swing: Due to technical limitations, the multi-sig must always vote with its full voting power. If 20% of circulating pPOOL votes for on a proposal, the full 100% of pPOOL votes will for.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nIf the proposal succeeds the following steps will be taken in order to wind down the POOL pool Snapshot and its functionality, as well as to inform the community:\n- Remove the POOL delegation from [Stake Prize Pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x396b4489da692788e327E2e4b2B0459A5Ef26791) to the [POOL pool Multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x070a96fe4Ad5155eA91d409E8AFec6B2F3C729c0)\n- Set the Snapshot to only allow authors to create proposals (done)\n- Remove all authors in the [settings of the pPOOL Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/poolpool.pooltogether.eth/settings) \n- Remove pPOOL from the [PoolTogether.eth snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/pooltogether.eth)\n- Remove pPOOL mentions from Governance Documentation & Forum Posts\n- Post announcement\n- Remove the option to deposit into POOL pool [from the app](https://app.pooltogether.com/account)\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe proposal was discussed thoroughly on Discord and later brought as [RFC to the governance forum](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-wind-down-the-pool-pool-snapshot/2900). \n\nThe alternative to this proposal would be to fully embrace the gasless voting setup of the POOL pool, but with the mentioned dangers down the road it's likely not feasible.\n\nObjections were made that we should not cut off voters. Since the original POOL pool implementation lots of new opportunities in community governance arised. I encourage the community to propose new governance experiments that better suit our risk-tolerance once this proposal has passed.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nThe proposal calls the compLikeDelegate function to re-delegate the voting power of the [StakePrizePool](https://etherscan.io/address/0x396b4489da692788e327e2e4b2b0459a5ef26791) to `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000`:\n\n```\n| # | Name | Type | Data |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| 0 | compLike | address | 0x0cEC1A9154Ff802e7934Fc916Ed7Ca50bDE6844e |\n| 1 | to | address | 0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000 |\n```\n\n```\nFunction: compLikeDelegate(address compLike, address to)\n\nMethodID: 0x2f7627e3\n[0]:  0000000000000000000000000cec1a9154ff802e7934fc916ed7ca50bde6844e\n[1]:  00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n```",

Depending on the POOL price at the time of the execution, the amount of POOL paired with that ETH will vary. The remaining amount of POOL will be added from the price at the time of the execution to .0012 WETH/POOL.\n\nIn the unlikely case that POOL price falls below .0004 WETH/POOL, the USDC would be returned to the Treasury. POOL would be added to the active range from .0004 to .0012 WETH/POOL.\n\n## Technical Specification\nTransfer 63567345210 USDC to 0xDa63D70332139E6A8eCA7513f4b6E2E0Dc93b693\nTransfer 36432654790 PTaUSDC to 0xDa63D70332139E6A8eCA7513f4b6E2E0Dc93b693\nTransfer 200000000000000000000000 POOL to 0xDa63D70332139E6A8eCA7513f4b6E2E0Dc93b693\n\n## Status\n\nRFC: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-strengthening-our-foundation-for-protocol-owned-liquidity/2763\nOnchain: https://vote.pooltogether.com/proposals/62\n\n\n",

      "title": "# PTIP-84- Increase ETH exposure while supporting the stETH pool",
      "content": "### Overview\nWithdraw $250,000 in DAI tokens currently held in sponsorship and send to the Pooltogether Executive team. Pooltogether Executive team will swap the DAI for stETH and deposit $150,000 USD equivalent into the steth.win pool as sponsorship. The stETH sponsorship tokens and the remaining stETH will be sent back to Pooltogether treasury.\n\n### Motivations and Reasoning\nPooltogether’s treasury holdings are mostly stablecoins and POOL with the stablecoins earning a very low rate of return and tied to the price of the USD which gives limited upside. More exposure to ETH is something that has been brought up several times by the community but we’ve not pulled the trigger. We’ve also had a stETH pool recently launched by @underthesea, with 50% of the proceeds going to charity and the remainder to 2 winning depositors. This pool already has had 12 stETH in sponsorship added by Witnet. We’d like to support this community pool while increasing our ETH exposure. Recent discussions and polls on the forum have shown majority support for both increasing ETH exposure and sponsoring the community built stETH pool. See the conversations here: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-convert-489k-dai-balance-to-steth-and-deposit-as-sponsorship-into-steth-pool-on-pooltogether/2730\nThis proposal has been decreased from the original proposed amount of $489K to satisfy the wishes of many community members to do a lesser amount. My intention is that in the event that ETH price drops in the coming months I would potentially propose some more buys with the remaining DAI.\n\nHaving this transaction done by the Executive team will simplify the process and the funds will only be in the custody of the Executive team for a short time. The Executive team multisig is a 7/11 signature safe and is capable of handling this dollar amount and transactions with no issues.\n\n### Technical Specification\nContract aDAI 0x028171bCA77440897B824Ca71D1c56caC55b68A3\nExec-Team Safe 0xDa63D70332139E6A8eCA7513f4b6E2E0Dc93b693\nTransfer 250000000000000000000000\n",

This includes:\n\n- Designing and developing upgrades to the protocol\n- Working with partners to support protocol integrations\n- Implementing security best practices to ensure the protocol is safe\n- Automating operational transactions to ensure the protocol runs smoothly\n\n# Performance Goals and Metrics\n\nThe team's goals for this quarter are a continuation of last quarter. We are going to:\n\n- Upgrade PoolTogether V4 to make it fully decentralized\n- Launch the PoolTogether Hyperstructure\n\n## Decentralizing V4\n\nWe are continuing to work on decentralizing the V4 protocol. This goal began in Q4 2022, and you can read more detail about it in the [Protocol Team Q4 2022 TBR](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/tbr-q4-2022-pt-inc-protocol-team/2576#decentralizing-v4-4).\n\n### Milestones\n\n- ~~Install VRF 2.0 on Polygon~~\n- ~~Install VRF 2.0 on Avalanche~~\n- ~~Trustless bridge abstraction (ERC5164)~~\n- Upgrade V4 Ethereum to use DPR (in testnet)\n- Upgrade V4 Polygon to use DPR (in testnet)\n- Upgrade V4 Optimism to use DPR (in testnet)\n- Upgrade V4 Avalanche to use DPR (in testnet)\n- Bridge draws to Optimism (in development)\n\n**Bonus**\n\n- We've developed a dapp to update the Draw Percentage Rate\n\n## PoolTogether Hyperstructure\n\nWhat was previously called \"version 5\", or V5, we are now internally referring to as the PoolTogether Hyperstructure. This is because our goal for the next version is to release a new core that is immutable, but can be permissionlessly extended.\n\nSignificant progress has been made with the design of the hyperstructure. We have a draft whitepaper, but it still needs revisions, polish, and critique.\n\nTodo:\n\n- finalize design\n- deploy testnet\n- audit\n- launch\n\n# Budget\n\n## Requested Amount\n\n| Token | Amount |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| POOL | 1440.95 |\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n### Team Members\n\n| Role | Yearly USD Compensation | Commitment Percentage | Quarterly USDC | Quarterly POOL | Contributor | Contributor Discord |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Team Lead | N/A | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc) | 0 | Brendan Asselstine | Brendan 🌊🏆#1830 |\n| Protocol Engineer | $211,166 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc) | 26,813.98 | Pierrick Turelier | Pierrick#1350 |\n| Protocol Engineer | $202,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc) | (covered by Client Team) | Dylan DesRosier | dylandesrosier#6262 |\n\n## Team Expenses\n\nThe following are ballpark expenses for the quarter. Note that the security bounties are more of a reserve- if no exploits are reported it will rollover. Likewise for auditing, although our goal is to have the PT Hyperstructure on testnet and auditing this quarter.\n\n| Description | Amount |\n| ----------- | ------ |\n| Security Bounties | $50,000 | \n| Auditing | $250,000 |\n\n# Retrospective\n\n## Goals\n\n- We've made great progress in decentralizing V4, as noted above\n- We have a solid draft of the hyperstructure\n- We hired internally for the protocol engineer position by shifting Dylan over from the client team.

Client Team** |\n| Quarter and Year | **Q1 2023** |\n| Payout Address | **0x3927E0642C432A934a4EAA64C79bC8a1D8ac5Fb7** |\n| Total USD Value Requested | **$45,136.31 USD** |\n\n# Purpose\n\n   The PoolTogether Inc. Client team is responsible for providing client support for the protocol. This includes maintaining and expanding the flagship consumer interface at app.pooltogether.com and developing additional dapps on tools.pooltogether.com and vote.pooltogether.com. The Client team is also building tooling for developers to easily build on top of the protocol with things like tutorials, SDKs and APIs.\n\n# Goals\n    \n1. **Explore PoolTogether Ecosystem**\n    Exploring the PoolTogether ecosystem is too difficult and needs to be reworked. An updated version of the current landing page at <https://tools.pooltogether.com> will be designed and developed to highlight the possibilities of the protocol, existing interfaces and tools for the protocol and ways to build on top of the protocol.\n    \n    **Deliverable:** A redesigned Protocol Ecosystem landing page.\n    \n2. **Protocol Landing Page**\n    An updated landing page for the protocol with more of a \"protocol focus\" and less of a \"product focus\". We want to highlight governance, protocol features and the DAO more and focus less on the singular interface located at <https://app.pooltogether.com>. Some examples of \"protocol focused\" landing pages are: Liquity, Lido, Uniswap and Aave.\n    \n    **Deliverable:** A redesigned Protocol landing page.\n    \n3. **PoolTogether V4 App Maintenance & Bugs**\n    While it's fully functional there's always optimizations, upgrades and inevitable bugs. We will continue to maintain and improve the existing interface.\n    \n4. **Hiring**\n    The client team is looking to hire 1 full time engineer to help work across the stack on the various interfaces and infrastructure used by the client team and external developers. As Dylan transitions to the protocol team we will need more front end developer bandwith to help with the upcoming goals.\n    \n**Stretch Goals**\n    \n    \n5. **PoolTogether Hyperstructure Interface Alpha**\n    In conjunction with the protocol team the client team will provide a new interface for the next version of the protocol. As of now, the new interface will be more of an admin interface and less of a consumer app. We will be prioritizing functionality and simplicity for of development over user experience (it'll still be pretty though).\n    \n    **Deliverable:** No guaranteed deliverable. Depends on external factors.\n    \n6. **PoolTogether Hyperstructure Tools Alpha**\n    With the new protocol design several mini apps (tools) will be required to interact with specific pieces of the protocol. The client team will provide intuitive interfaces for each mechanism. An example from last quarter that will be expanded upon is the [liquidator](https://tools.pooltogether.com/liquidator) (NOTE: set the app to developer mode to access.)\n    \n    **Deliverable:** No guaranteed deliverable. Depends on external factors.\n    \n8. **PoolTogether Hyperstructure SDK Alpha**\n    A Typescript SDK will be developed alongside the interface. This SDK will provide a simple way for developers to build on top of the protocol without needing to know the low level details of the protocol. Some priorities are: simplicity and customizability. Tutorials and documentation will be provided similar to the existing `v4-client-js`. \n    \n    **Deliverable:** No guaranteed deliverable. Depends on external factors.\n\n# Budget\n\n## Requested Amount\n\n| Amount | Token |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| 67,083.56 | POOL |\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n### Team Members\n\n| Role | Yearly USD Compensation | Commitment Percentage | Quarterly USDC | Quarterly POOL | Contributor | Contributor Discord |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Senior Designer | $145,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc.) | 16,811 | Alex | alxx#6155 |\n| Software Engineer | $202,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc.) | 24,618.14 | Dylan DesRosier | dylandesrosier#6262 |\n| Junior Software Engineer | $100,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc.) | 6,502.32 | Noah Cukiert | Ncookie#1619 |\n| Senior Software Engineer | $250,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc.) | 37,156.10 | **Open Role** |  |\n\nThe maximum POOL salary for the open position is being requested (see the [compensation formula spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zkgljshTWmJke85LZqtlZYxmb6aZLoFQxeWx5q7mEPI/edit#gid=0))) to keep the door open for high quality candidates. If we do not hire this quarter, we will roll the tokens over to next quarter. If we decide we don’t need to fill the role, we will return the tokens. If we hire they will likely be below the max, so we will return or roll over the remaining tokens.\n\n### Team Expenses\n\nAdditional expenses are currently being covered by PT Inc.\n\n# Retrospective\n\n## Q4 2022 Goals\n\n1. **Core App Redesign**\n   The interface found at <https://app.pooltogether.com> was overhauled, all code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-ui).\n\n2. **V5 App Alpha**\n    An alpha version was [built](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-ui/pull/68) but has been halted. There is more work being done designing the protocol and the UI comes second. Alongside the core app alpha some additional mini apps (tools) were required. A liquidator implementation is available [here](https://tools.pooltogether.com/liquidator).\n  \n3. **V5 JS SDK**\n   An alpha version was [built](https://github.com/pooltogether/v4-client-js/tree/new-tokenomics-alpha) but has been halted.  There is more work being done designing the protocol and the JS SDK comes second. \n   \n4. **V3 App Deprecation**\n   The [v3 interface](https://v3.pooltogether.com) was deprecated. Support for all features from the v3 site are available on <https://app.pooltogether.com> and <https://tools.pooltogether.com>.\n   \n5. **Hiring**\n    One engineering position was filled, another engineering position is still open. We also hired a Senior Designer earlier than anticipated so we've redirected the unfilled positions POOL to them.\n\n## Budget Surplus\n\n**18,004 POOL**\n\n- 25,373.03 - 7,369 POOL\n    These tokens are from the unfilled Software Engineer position will be rolled over this quarter and subtracted from the total requested amount as the position is still open. However, due to hiring a Senior Designer that wasn't initially planned for Q4 we've repurposed these funds to handle their POOL allocation. The rate used is the same as what is being requested in this document and was pro-rated to their start date for the quarter.\n\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Token Pricing\n\n| Token | USD |\n| ---- | ---- |\n| USDC | $1 |\n| POOL | $0.6728370667 |",

There have been great tutorials from users like @thumbsupfinance & Kris Kay (Defi Donut) in the past. We hope to emulate this while also updating, maintaining & translating our content. We will help crypto natives & those new to crypto find the smoothest route to go from fiat to ptUSDC. These could vary greatly between different countries and user preferences (self custody vs custodial), we hope to provide understanding which will empower users to choose the best route to deposit for them.\n\nWe hope to achieve this through providing comprehensive, structured and easy to understand tutorials as well as live support. The live support could be specific hours team members spend in the #help channel of the discord as well as private voice chats / support within the PT discord. \n\n\nGoals\n\nCreate a knowledge foundation of crypto for users to easily understand and use PoolTogether\n\nCreate & maintain guides for onboarding depositors\n\nProvide Live support for users\n\nBonus goal to pursue if we deem 1-3 to be performed to our expectations:\n\nEducate Users on how to stay safe when navigating crypto\n\nExpense\tBudget\nTeam Members\t$21,404\nCoordinape\t$5,000\nBounties\t$3,000\nTools / Subscriptions\t$200\nTotal\t$29,604\n\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown of our goals & reasoning please visit our governance post https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-tbr-q1-2023-education-onboarding-team/2669",

We handle custody and transaction matters where directed by governance, such as claiming rewards, and receiving tokens on networks other than mainnet. We are the goto solution for maximum security custody for the community.\n\nWe will take on a new task of custodying delegation funds for L2s. This proposal includes 300k USDC which will be represented by Grants Team (100k), Community Team (100k) and SerHotMike for the growth team. Delegation funds will be separate from prize liquidity for clarity and deposited to the multi-delegator or as undelegated tickets. This operation has the side benefit of increased prize generation for sponsorship funds that are not delegated.\n\nNote: We shall introduce a custody limit of $750k for this quarter to put a hard cap on our total custody. Activities that approach the cap will be brought forward as an alert. Any funds over that amount will need to be approved by a vote to change the cap. This gives the community a clear picture of what our custody risk is.\n\nGoals\nOur primary focus is security. We maintain a 7/11 multi-sig of senior contributors who are well versed in PoolTogether infrastructure, happenings, and the greater DeFi ecosystem.\n\nWe look to act in a timely and efficient manner to ensure prize liquidity never runs dry, and that Pooler and treasury funds are safe.\n\nThese pillars form our goals\n\nSecurity\nNo loss. We strive to never lose funds. This is an easily evaluated metric we strive to maintain.\n\nActing on governance directives\nA quarterly team survey evaluates our performance alignment with governance directives. The executive-team aligns with the council. Any concerns from the community are encouraged.\n\nEnsuring prize delivery\nPrizes promised are prizes delivered. We strive for no failed prize claims due to a lack of prize liquidity.\n\nActing in an organized and efficient way.\nA new procedure is being introduced to outline execution time expectations. Transactions will be presented by lead as having a standard 24hr time to sign and execute. Transactions requiring more immediate attention will be presented with a 12hr time to sign and execute. The team will strive to always meet these deadlines and missed time windows will be reported at quarters end.\n\nBudget\nRequested Amount\nAmount\tToken\n309,181\tUSDC\n\nBudget Breakdown\nTeam Members\nRole\tYearly USD Compensation\tCommitment Percentage\tQuarterly USDC\tQuarterly POOL\tContributor\tContributor Discord\nLead\t$100,000\t16%\t$3,164\t646\tunderthesea\tunderthesea\nSigner\t$100,000\t4%\t$791\t161\tDaBoom\tDaBoom\nSigner\t$100,000\t4%\t$791\t161\tdrcpu\tdrcpu\nSigner\t$100,000\t4%\t$791\t161\tHook\tHook\nSigner\t$100,000\t4%\t$791\t161\tKames\tKames\nSigner\t$100,000\t4%\t$791\t161\tLonser\tLonser\nSigner\t$100,000\t4%\t$791\t161\tMcOso\tMcOso\nSigner\t$100,000\t4%\t$791\t161\tPierrick\tPierrick\nSigner\t$100,000\t4%\t$791\t161\tTheRealTuna\tTheRealTuna\nSigner\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tBrendan\tBrendan\nSigner\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tn/a\tLeighton\tLeighton\n\nTeam Expenses\nDescription\tAmount\nGas\t1,000 USDC\nL2 Delegation\t300,000 USDC\n\nPrevious Budget Surplus\nDescription\tAmount\tToken\nComp budget\t5,148\tPOOL\nComp budget\t1,311\tUSDC\n\nAppendix\nCurrently held POOL exceeds POOL required for the quarter.

      "content": "https://vote.pooltogether.com/proposals/49\n\n| | |\n| --------- | ---------- |\n| Team Name | **Finance Team** |\n| Quarter and Year | **Q4 2022** |\n| Payout Address | **0xB74659A1011F6DCA3BA6F6e22a71bA8f414F36A1** |\n| Total USD Value Requested | **$44,250 USD** |\n\n# Purpose\n\nThe Finance team serves as a continuation of the previous Treasury Work Group and Interim Prize Team. The core purposes from these teams has always been to:\n\n* Ensure safety and prudence go into every decision\n\n* Drive future protocol growth\n\n* Identify sustainable solutions\n\n* Present objective data to the community\n\nAcquiring these same values, the Finance team will specially focus on DAO sustainability and transparency. With the DAO growth and the creation of multiple independent teams, the Finance team can offer a holistic view of the DAO to bring clarity on a financial perspective.\n\nAlso, with V5 on its way, new opportunities, assets and yield sources will come to the protocol. The Finance team should provide a recommendation on the new elements to make sure that the DAO is able to make informed decisions.\n\nFinally, the Finance team will monitor and implement changes to prize distributions with the purpose of growing the protocol in a sustainable manner. Example duties: monitoring prize data and sentiment, adjusting prizes and optimizing prize distributions to create the best user experience.\n\n# Goals\n\nAligned with the previously mentioned purposes, the Finance Team would have the following goals:\n\n**1. Quarterly review of DAO inflows/outflows**\n\nAs the DAO is expanding and attracting more contributors, a detailed view of incomes and expenses is required to determine the runway of the DAO and be able to plan accordingly.\n\nA quarterly report will be published giving specific and objective information on the inflows/outflows of the DAO.\n\n**2. Asset Management Analysis**\n\nProtocol’s Treasury can provide a significant yield to help achieve sustainability. Due to Governor Alpha constraints, the options from which yield could be obtained have been limited in the past. With more innovation coming to DeFi and other options to explore, the Finance team should look for safe opportunities to be able to get yield on the DAOs assets.\n\nWith the top priority of keeping funds in control of the governance contract, at least 3 different yield strategies will be presented to the DAO.\n\n**3. Protocol-Owned Liquidity solutions**\n\nGiven that the protocol is about to deploy liquidity on mainnet Uniswap V3, the team is committed to keep an eye on both this new deployment and the previous Polygon POL. It is also required to explore the possibilities to encourage depositors to migrate from Uniswap V2 to V3.\n\nAt least 1 alternative will be presented to the DAO to encourage Uniswap V2 LPers to migrate to Uniswap V3.\n\n**4. Prize distribution**\n\nPrizes are the main attraction of PoolTogether, so it is important to use them as effectively as possible to grow the protocol.\n\nMoving to weekly prizes is the main objective, as we consider that this will help unlock bigger prizes which will end up attracting more users. While doing this, we also plan to maintain sustainable prizes and keep the balance between yield inflows and prize outflows. Prize subsidy will be considered where a clear vision for growth is outlined and can be evaluated empirically for success.\n\nThe Finance Team will also build and maintain utilities (Node, Discord, WebApps, Dune) to monitor and measure prize results.\n\n# Budget\n\n## Requested Amount\n\n| Amount | Token |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| 37,170 | USDC |\n| 7,185 | POOL |\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n### Team Members\n\n| Role | Yearly USD Compensation | Commitment Percentage | Quarterly USDC | Quarterly POOL | Contributor | Contributor Discord |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Lead | $90,000 | 55% | 10,395 | 2,010 | underthesea | underthesea#4658 |\n| Member & Communications | $90,000 | 55% | 10,395 | 2,010 | BRONDER | BRONDER#4788 |\n| Accountant / Member | | | 5,460 | 1,055 | **Open Role** | |\n| Prize Analyst / Member | | | 5,460 | 1,055 | **Open Role** | |\n| Temporary Consultant | | | 5,460 | 1,055 | **Open Role** | |\n\nIn order to cover open roles we are looking for persons with experience in accounting, research or analytics, and expertise in liquidity and risk analysis. Those will be covered on specific occasions with a maximum budget of $6,500 per role.\n\n### Team Expenses\n\nNo expenses.\n\n## Previous Budget Surplus\n\nThe Finance team inherits the 3 out of 6 multisig previously used by the TWG (BraveNewDefi, BRONDER, DaBoom, drcpu, TheRealTuna, underthesea). As a consequence, the team inherits the existing budget for transactional costs kept safely in the gnosis safe amounting to:\n\n| Description | Amount | Token |\n| ----- | ----- | ----- |\nETH for Operations | 2.19 | ETH |\n\nThe Finance team will also inherit the UNI V3 positions on Polygon. However, as the team has become significantly smaller, the UNI V3 positions on Polygon should be migrated to the Exec-team for custody.\n\nRegarding the previous Prize team, the Finance team will inherit and maintain the previous 3 out of 5 multisig (BRONDER, Dylan, Leighton, Ncookie, underthesea). The other 3 members outside of the Finance team will be kept as informal advisors. This will allow us to move relatively fast in events of big yield changes or other unforeseen needs to adapt the prizes. This multisig does not custody any additional funds.\n\nThere is currently ~$225,000 USDC in prize liquidity reserves that can be used as subsidy for Q4.\n\nAll of the funds not used at the end of the quarter will be rolled over to the next quarter if the team is renewed. If not renewed, all leftover funds will be returned to the PoolTogether Treasury.\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Token Pricing\n\n| Token | USD |\n| ---- | ---- |\n| ETH | $1,300 |\n| USDC | $1 |\n| POOL | $0.985298 |",

Client Team** |\n| Quarter and Year | **Q4 2022** |\n| Payout Address | **0x3927E0642C432A934a4EAA64C79bC8a1D8ac5Fb7** |\n| Total USD Value Requested | **$45,939 USD** |\n\n# Purpose\n\n   The PoolTogether Inc. Client team is responsible for providing client support for the protocol. This includes maintaining and expanding the flagship consumer interface at app.pooltogether.com and developing additional dapps on tools.pooltogether.com and vote.pooltogether.com. The Client team is also building tooling for developers to easily build on top of the protocol with things like tutorials, SDKs and APIs.\n\n# Goals\n\n1. **Core App Redesign**\n\n   The interface found at app.pooltogether.com is in need of an update. The app started as a prototype and grew into the production app. The team has paid a Designer for a complete redesign and will be implementing this. The goal of the redesign is to be more approachable for new comers while maintaining the same (and more) level of details. Along with that, the redesign sets up the application for expanding to many more prize pools (deposit tokens, yield sources)\n\n   **Deliverable:** Deploy redesigned app in Q4\n\n2. **V5 App Alpha**\n\n   The client team has been developing an Alpha version of the app for the proposed V5 of PoolTogether. This will allow the community to have a more tangible way of testing the proposed changes. The team is working closely with the Protocol team to ensure a smooth transition from V4 to V5 in the future.\n\n   **Deliverable:** Deploy alpha app in Q4\n   \n3. **V5 JS SDK**\n\n   Alongside the alpha app, the client team will release alpha versions of @pooltogether/v4-client-js for interacting with the V5 protocol.\n\n   **Deliverable:** Deploy V5 JS SDK\n   \n4. **V3 App Deprecation**\n\n   Unfortunately the existing V3 app is expensive and difficult to maintain. To prepare for shutting down that UI we need alternative UIs for users to: withdraw & claim rewards.\n\n   **Deliverable:** Deprecate V3 app\n   **Deliverable:** Deploy V3 mini apps\n   \n5. **Hiring**\n\n    The PoolTogether client team is looking to hire 1 full time engineer to help work across the stack on the various interfaces and infrastructure used by the client team and external developers.\n\n   **Deliverable:** Hire a full time engineer\n\n# Budget\n\n## Requested Amount\n\n| Amount | Token |\n| ----- | ----- |\n| 46,624.47 | POOL |\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n### Team Members\n\n| Role | Yearly USD Compensation | Commitment Percentage | Quarterly USDC | Quarterly POOL | Contributor | Contributor Discord |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Software Engineer | $202,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc.) | 16,811.16 | Dylan DesRosier | dylandesrosier#6262 |\n| Junior Software Engineer | $100,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc.) | 4,440.28 | Noah Cukiert | Ncookie#1619 |\n| Software Engineer | $250,000 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc.) | 25,373.03 | **Open Role** |  |\n\nThe maximum POOL salary for the open position is being requested ( see the [compensation formula spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zkgljshTWmJke85LZqtlZYxmb6aZLoFQxeWx5q7mEPI/edit#gid=0))) to keep the door open for high quality candidates.

This includes:\n\n- Designing and developing upgrades to the protocol\n- Working with partners to support protocol integrations\n- Implementing security best practices to ensure the protocol is safe\n- Automating operational transactions to ensure the protocol runs smoothly\n\n## Merging Existing Teams\n\nThere are two existing \"teams\" that the protocol team will include: the Ethereum Operations Team and the informal security team.\n\nThe existing Ethereum Operations Team will be turned into the Protocol Team, with the only two active members being Brendan and Pierrick. The Eth Ops Team currently holds ~$250k in USDC held directly and across two Sablier streams. These funds will be re-purposed for use by the Protocol Team, and the other two signers on the multisig will be removed.\n\nThe informal security team is really just Brendan's relationship with Code Arena. Several PTIPs in the past have transferred funds to Code Arena to top-up an account used for PT protocol audits. The account is used to fund core protocol changes, and the current balance is ~$156k USDC. Brendan will be leading the protocol team, so this account will be re-purposed as the auditing account for the Protocol Team.\n\n# Q4 2022 Performance Goals and Metrics\n\nOver the next three months, the protocol team plans to improve the core PoolTogether V4. We will:\n\n- Upgrade PoolTogether V4 to make it fully decentralized\n- Continue research and development of V5\n- Hire a additional developer\n\n## Decentralizing V4\n\nThe PoolTogether protocol version 4 currently uses OpenZeppelin Defender relayers to copy information from one chain to another. This means that if someone takes control of Defender they can manipulate the protocol. We wish to upgrade the protocol so that Defender is simply automating functions that can be called by anyone.\n\nThere are several parts to the upgrade:\n\n1. Replace Draw oracle with bridges and local VRFs. [ERC-5164](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5164) is part of our efforts.\n2. Replace TVL oracle by upgrading V4 to use the [Draw Percentage Rate](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/pt-v4-1-draw-percentage-rate-dpr/1911). This eliminates the need to broadcast the TVL across all chains.\n3. Eliminate Timelocks. By eliminating the above attack vectors, we can improve the user experience.\n\n### Milestones\n\n1. Install VRF 2.0 on Polygon\n2. Bridge draws trustlessly to Optimism (via [ERC-5164](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5164))\n3. Install VRF 2.0 on Avalanche\n4. Upgrade V4 Ethereum to use DPR\n5. Upgrade V4 Polygon to use DPR\n6. Upgrade V4 Optimism to use DPR\n7. Upgrade V4 Avalanche to use DPR\n\n## PoolTogether V5\n\nWith V4 locked down, we'll be able to continue work on PoolTogether V5. This new version will extend the excellent V4 prize design with strong tokenomics that incentivize protocol growth. We will also be focusing on making the protocol **permissionless** and **autonomous**. This way no one needs to ask governance permission to extend the protocol, and we will reduce the number of PTIPs required to manage the protocol.\n\n**Performance Milestones:**\n- finalize V5 design\n- deliver a public V5 testnet\n\n## Hire Developers\n\nTo realize these goals, we'll need more developers. Another goal will be to hire another developer so that we can build faster.\n\n**Goal: hire another protocol engineer**\n\n# Budget\n\n## Requested Amount\n\n| Total |\n| ----- |\n| 43683.68 POOL |\n\n## To Be Returned\n\n| Total |\n| ----- |\n| 156,400 ScUSDC |\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\n### Team Members\n\nList every role on the team with the following template:\n\n| Role | Yearly USD Compensation | Commitment Percentage | Quarterly USDC | Quarterly POOL | Contributor | Contributor Discord |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| Team Lead | N/A | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc) | 0 | Brendan Asselstine | Brendan 🌊🏆#1830 |\n| Protocol Engineer | $211,166 | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc) | 18,310.65 | Pierrick Turelier | Pierrick#1350 |\n| Protocol Engineer | $250,000 (max) | 100% | 0 (covered by PT Inc) | 25,373.03 | **Open Role** | |\n\nWe will be hiring a Protocol Engineer this quarter, so we want to be ready with compensation. The above POOL is the maximum possible quarterly ownership for an employee (see the [compensation formula spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zkgljshTWmJke85LZqtlZYxmb6aZLoFQxeWx5q7mEPI/edit#gid=0)) If we do not hire this quarter, we will roll the tokens over to next quarter.  If we decide we don't need to fill the role, we will return the tokens. If we hire they will likely be below the max, so we will return or roll over the remaining tokens.\n\n## Previous Budget Surplus\n\nThe Protocol Team will inherit a significant amount of budget from the Ethereum Operations Team and Brendan's relationship with Code Arena. I estimate this budget will be sufficient for Q4 stablecoin expenses, and beyond.\n\n| Description | Amount | Token |\n| ------------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| C4 outstanding account balance | 156,400 | USDC |\n| Held assets | 320,000 | ScUSDC |\n| Remaining in stream | 30,000 | ScUSDC |\n\nNote: Token prices at time of budget request are used for standardization.

We strongly encourage you to check out the grants we’ve funded, which you can find in our monthly Medium articles 3.\n\nLast season, we experimented a lot with grants for delegations as an alternative to direct payments. This has been very successful! Examples include the NFT Christmas cards, the Valentine’s delegation NFT giveaway and the prizes for PoolStreaks.\n\nWe’re also supporting new initiatives by the community, such as the PoolTogether community podcast and substack 1. Another highlight was jumpstarting the Pooltogether Bounties, which are currently running hot preparing Pooltogether’s launch on Optimism.\n\nIn S2Q1, we funded grants to the amount of $88.5k and spent $15.6k on committee wages and expenses.\nIn S2Q2, we funded grants to the amount of $89.6k and spent $12k on committee wages and expenses.\n\nWe started out the last quarter with 102k POOL @$2.44 ($250k), which continually fell in Dollar value, leading to a tighter budget than anticipated.\n\nSpecification\nThe committee multisigs currently hold about $24k worth of POOL (@$0.87) and 199k USDC, across Ethereum and Polygon. We have $57k committed to open grant milestones that have not been paid out. For the first quarter of season 3, we are applying for $226k in POOL and 51k USDC in additional funding, to bring us back to a total of $500k as outlined in PTIP-14. Any amount left over at the end of the first quarter will again be rolled over to the next quarter’s funding.\nApproving this PTIP is meant to signal intent to fund both quarter 1 and 2 of season 3. The budget for quarter 2 will be requested at the end of quarter 1 through a separate PTIP, in order to limit the funds available in the multisigs at any given time.\n\nTransparency\nAs we are funded by Pooltogether governance, it is important to us that we are transparent about what we are doing. You can find our transparency resources ranging from funded projects and updates to member timesheets below. If there is anything you would like to see improved in this area, please let us know.\n\nMedium Articles & Updates - PoolGrants 3\n\nFunded Projects - Funded projects 3\n\nCommittee Time Tracking - Committee time tracking 1\n\nCommittee Members\nThe PoolGrants committee members for Season 3 will be:\n\nLead: @Torgin (continuing)\nDeputy Lead: @gabor (continuing)\n\nReviewers:\n@McOso (continuing)\n@Taliskye (continuing)\n@TangFeng (continuing)\n@tanman (new)\n@Lonser (new)\n\nThe process for choosing committee members was the same as previously.\nThere were open applications for all positions, then the lead positions were elected by the community. Following this, the leads interviewed reviewer applicants and decided who shall join the team as a reviewer.\n\nBudget:\nThe budget will remain the same as outlined in PTIP-14 1.\n\nThe budget for each quarter is capped at $500k with a maximum of $100k accounting for the operating budget.\n\nThe compensation will continue to be $100/hr for all roles.\n\nHours will be capped at 30 hrs/week split among the two leads and 6hrs/week per reviewer.\n\nIn the past, these caps have rarely been hit.\n\nTechnical specification\nTransfer 353’000 POOL ($226k @$0.87) from treasury to PoolGrants Ethereum multisig.\n\nTransfer 51’000 PTaUSDC from treasury to PoolGrants Ethereum multisig.\n\nMultisig’s address: 0xd605bB8A3DA1f7f777276D3c97c828aAc3Dd4252",

      "title": "PTIP-74: Treasury Working Group Third Quarter Renewal",
      "content": "Simple Summary\nThe Treasury Working Group (TWG) was formed after PTIP-46 1 was passed. Last quarter, the TWG was funded with 12,820 POOL for our third operational quarter, plus 3,000 USDC for execution and reimbursement costs. Now that the TWG’s second operational quarter is complete, members are seeking renewal for a third quarter and a budget request of 52,314 POOL/quarter, as well as 2,000 USDC (to be converted to ETH) for PTIP and execution gas costs.\n\nIf this PTIP is approved, the TWG’s third quarter would begin on Wednesday (15 June 2022).\n\nAbstract\nThe TWG reviewed our third operational quarter performance and outlined our third quarter deliverables in the forum post below and within the TWG Notion page.\n\nPer our original proposal, the TWG’s core purpose is to:\n\nEnsure safety and prudence go into every decision\nDrive future protocol growth\nIdentify sustainable solutions\nPresent objective data to the community\nIn keeping with our core purpose, the TWG will focus on our core duties plus the following high level deliverables, which we’ve identified as top priority for our third quarter:\n\nMotivation\nThe TWG provides objective analysis and data for any governance proposal or forum post that discusses a potential use of treasury funds. During our second quarter, the TWG provided analysis on POL initiatives, received approval to experiment with Uni v3 on Polygon, advised on prize tiering to reduce subsidy but stay competitive, advocated for deployment on Ethereum rollup solutions (i.e., Optimism), and more. For a full review of our activity, Poolers can review the Treasury Working Group page on Notion.\n\nMembers of the TWG have played a vital role in governance discussions regarding prize tiering and simulation.\n\nFor our proposed third quarter, the TWG will focus on pressing issues for the DAO: namely, reviewing the new prize pool network on testnet, potential avenues for growth, infrastructure that can be used to create new products (via bounty), DAO expenditures, and POL analysis, recommendations. The main theme of our third quarter will be on sustainable practices, which concern DAO expenditures and growth initiatives (re: growing inflows to offset outflows).\n\nThe TWG will also expand the core duties of the working group, like those stated above. Over our first two quarters, members have provided sound analysis and recommendations on the proposed core duties–the community has been receptive to the past RFCs and PTIPs put forth by the TWG, as reflected in governance outcomes.\n\nWe’ll also work with other working groups within PoolTogether, such as the Marketing Working Group (MWG) to determine how the protocol can balance expense management with the Optimism launch campaign and the mutli-delegator contract to achieve growth in deposits.\n\nIn our third quarter, the TWG will deliver on our core purpose, while providing DAO members with the objective analysis and insight necessary to make informed decisions on treasury-related governance proposals.\n\nSpecification\nIn our second quarter, the TWG requested a budget of 12,820 POOL/quarter, with an allocation of 4,273.33 POOL per month that was distributed via Coordinape. Distributions were executed from the TWG Polgyon multisig: 0x8F8e905Cd8b7b0e435e1030BE250970Bf8c9ab8B\n\nOver the course of our second quarter, 4,273.33 POOL were distributed among active contributors each month.\n\nWhen our second budget was requested, POOL was ~$3.34/POOL. The TWG chose to be paid in POOL to align incentives with the DAO. The total quarterly budget was $30,000 USD, or $10,000/month. During our second quarter, the average contributor received $712.16 in POOL for their monthly contribution due to the change in POOL prices.\n\nFor our third operational quarter, the TWG is seeking $35,000 in POOL, which is equivalent to 52,314 POOL/quarter, or  17,438 POOL/month at the market price of $0.66/POOL. We still believe payment in POOL aligns incentives with the community and drives us to work for the betterment of the protocol. An increased allocation to our budget is intended to reduce the churn of contributors and provide incentives for at least 6 contributors, so we can expand the scope of the TWG’s analysis and core duties.\n\nIf this PTIP is approved, our third quarter would begin on Wednesday (15 June 2022).\n\nReview of, Request for Compensation Related to On-Chain Governance Gas Costs\nMembers spent a total of 0.48808710089 ETH in gas costs for submitting on-chain transaction executions and proposals on behalf of the TWG. This amount includes direct costs from the mainnet multisig and the reimbursement costs for members.\n\nOur initial funding was 3,000 USDC, which was converted to 0.87367 ETH. Currently, the TWG has 0.3856 ETH remaining in the mainnet multisig. As there are additional gas costs associated with submitting on-chain proposals and executing transactions on mainnet, we request a 2,000 budget in USDC that will be used to acquire ETH that is held in the TWG multisig on mainnet; some of this funding will go to reimbursing TWG members over the next quarter for executing transactions and submitting on-chain proposals. Any ETH that is not used for executing on-chain proposals can be returned to the treasury or rolled over at the end of the operational quarter.\n\nRead more in the governance thread: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-74-treasury-working-group-third-quarter-renewal/2333",

The PooTogether prize party continues as we expand to Optimism! \n\nAbstract\nThis proposal on execution will transfer 300k in PTaUSDC to the executive-team safe on Ethereum mainnet. The executive-team then will balance the prize liquidity reserves across chains.\n\nMotivation\nThis request comes in anticipation for the Optimism deployment. \n\nOverview\nIt is estimated this liquidity provision will sustain prize distribution for three to six months depending on deposits, yield, and prize tierings set by governance. \n\nRationale\nPoolTogether wants to grow and is excited to be part of the Optimism community.  Adding chains requires greater prize reserves to minimize bridging efforts and stay efficient. Moving USDC to prize reserves independently has no negative impact to the treasury. The funds are deposited to the yield source to grow prizes, be it “sponsorship” from the treasury or in the prize distributor.  \n\n\nTechnical Specification\nTransfer 300000000000 PTaUSDC (0xdd4d117723C257CEe402285D3aCF218E9A8236E1) from Treasury Timelock to Executive-Team Gnosis safe on Ethereum (0xDa63D70332139E6A8eCA7513f4b6E2E0Dc93b693)\n\nStatus\nOnchain vote: https://vote.pooltogether.com/proposals/40\nPrevious Thread: Authorize Optimism Prize Pool https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-73-authorize-optimism-prize-pool/2261\n",

Currently, the pool is emitting 200 POOL per day in the form of a POOL drip. Previously the pool has additionally been awarding a weekly prize of 200 POOL.\n\n### Rationale\nThe POOL pool is one of the few incentives POOL token holders currently have. Users in the POOL pool might not just care to vote in governance, but they might also care for incentives.\nOften the pPOOL represents half of the voting power brandished on any given vote. Per capita, the pPOOL sees 5:1 voters compared to on-chain. Continuing to reward these protocol participants and holders is crucial until we implement a new method of governance and vesting.\nWe should continue incentivizing POOL token holders to hold and vote by staking in the POOL pool. This proposal continues the POOL drip towards the POOL pool for 60 days at the current rate of 200 POOL per day (12,000 POOL total). As the weekly prize will not be continued, the proposal also removes the pool’s early exit fee.\n\n### Technical Specification\nTransfer on the POOL token `0x0cEC1A9154Ff802e7934Fc916Ed7Ca50bDE6844e` amount `12000000000000000000000` POOL to `0x30430419b86e9512E6D93Fc2b0791d98DBeb637b` pPOOL faucet\n\nSetCreditPlanOf on the POOL pool `0x396b4489da692788e327E2e4b2B0459A5Ef26791` Token: `0x27D22A7648e955E510a40bDb058333E9190d12D4` \n_creditRateMantissa (uint128): 0 \n_creditLimitMantissa (uint128): 0\n\n### Status\nPrevious Discussion: [RFC: Renewing pPOOL and POOL/ETH LP Uni V2 Rewards](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-renewing-ppool-and-pool-eth-lp-uni-v2-rewards/2158)\nOn-chain Vote: https://vote.pooltogether.com/proposals/38",

      "title": "PTIP-69 Polygon Uniswap V3 WETH/POOL Liquidity",
      "content": "# PTIP-69 \n\n## Simple Summary \nThe Treasury Working Group (TWG) proposes deploying WETH/POOL liquidity on Polygon to support the POOL token and broaden our community knowledge of Uniswap V3. ## Abstract We propose that the TWG be approved to execute the deployment of a Uniswap V3 position on Polygon for WETH/POOL. The deployment would be maintained by the TWG for 90 days at which time it could be re-evaluated and potentially renewed.\n\n## Motivation \nThe majority of PT users now are on Polygon, and while over 100k POOL currently circulates on Polygon the liquidity is extremely shallow resulting in high slippage. This proposal will add significant support to the POOL token on Polygon. In addition we are looking to build community knowledge as we move towards a much greater cross-chain liquidity solution for the POOL token. Lastly protocol owned liquidity will generate fees for the protocol. ## Specification Transfer 25k POOL and 6525 GTC from the Treasury to the TWG Gnosis safe. The TWG will then swap the GTC for ETH and bridge both POOL and ETH to Polygon. The tokens will be added to WETH/POOL on Uniswap V3.\n\n### Rationale \nPrevious attempts for protocol owned liquidity with Olympus PRO and Ondo LaaS have been deemed unsuccessful and the protocol is looking for the most effective liquidity solution to support the token. We have chosen to use half of the treasuries Gitcoin holdings because they represent the largest unutilized holding in the treasury. WETH will be the base pair for its popular routing and to build some position for the treasury as the POOL token appreciates.\n\n### Technical Specification \ncontract: POOL `0x0cEC1A9154Ff802e7934Fc916Ed7Ca50bDE6844e` \ntransfer `25000000000000000000000`\nto `0xB74659A1011F6DCA3BA6F6e22a71bA8f414F36A1` \n\ncontract: GTC `0xDe30da39c46104798bB5aA3fe8B9e0e1F348163F` \ntransfer `6525000000000000000000` \nto `0xB74659A1011F6DCA3BA6F6e22a71bA8f414F36A1` \n\n## Status \nRFC: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-protocol-deployed-liquidity-on-polygon-uniswap-v3/2145 \nOnchain Vote: https://vote.pooltogether.com/proposals/35\n\n",

After settlement, the Ondo team will send back 307,693.06 POOL to the PoolTogether treasury (93,639 more than originally provided).\n\nAbstract\nThe TWG proposes that the protocol send 350,559.66 USDC to Ondo to settle LaaS program debt OTC to avoid needing to rebalance on the market with low liquidity.\n\nSpecification\nIn order to receive the 307,693.06 POOL held within Ondo’s smart contracts now that the program has concluded, PoolTogether needs to settle the 350,559.66 USDC debt.\n\nRationale\nWhen PoolTogether deployed POOL into the LaaS program, 214,000 POOL was allocated to the variable-rate position. Fei Protocol provided 1,134,200 FEI in the fixed-rate position, with a hurdle of 5.13% APY to be satisfied at maturity.\n\nThe settlement terms highlight the difference in FEI + POOL at the conclusion of the program, where PoolTogether has an additional 93,693.06 POOL tokens, which are valued at $278,268.38 given today’s prices ($2.97 at time of writing). The DAO also received 67,828.55 TRIBE valued at $34,850.85 given today’s prices ($0.513808 at time of writing). Taking these amounts into account, the net cost to the protocol is roughly $37,440.43 when POOL and TRIBE is taken into consideration along with the senior position hurdle.\n\nSettling directly with Ondo will prevent further sell pressure on the POOL token, which would happen if POOL were exchanged for FEI directly on-chain.\n\nI spoke with Gabriel Bianconi from Ondo and reached an agreement on these terms. Upon execution of this PTIP, Ondo will send the 307,693.06 POOL back to the protocol treasury.\n\nTechnical Specification\ncall withdrawFrom YieldSourcePrizePool (0xd89a09084555a7D0ABe7B111b1f78DFEdDd638Be)\nfrom 0x42cd8312d2bce04277dd5161832460e95b24262e (gov timelock) amount 350559660000\n\ncall transfer USDC contract (0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48)\nto 0x7EBa8a9cAcb4bFbf7e1258b402A8e7aA004ED9FD value 350559660000\n\nOnchain Vote: https://vote.pooltogether.com/proposals/37\nForum PTIP: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-68-otc-settlement-for-ondo-fei-laas-program/2164\n",

      "content": "# PTIP-67 Move 400k PTaUSDC to Prize Reserves\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal will move 400k PTaUSDC from treasury deposited V4 \"sponsorship\" to the prize reserves managed by the executive-team.  Having adequate prizes reserves ensures all prizes awarded can be fulfilled.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal on execution will transfer 400k in PTaUSDC to the executive-team safe on Ethereum mainnet.  The executive-team then will balance the prize liquidity reserves across chains.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRefilling the prize reserves is an accounts management activity for the treasury.  We do not keep all treasury V4 deposits in prize liquidity because it is managed by a multi-sig.  But we do need an amount sufficient to balance prize liquidity across chains efficiently and provide cushion for any possible demand scenarios.\n\n\n### Overview\n\nIt is estimated this liquidity provision will sustain us for two months with the current prize distribution or six months with the proposed prized distributions in PTIP-66.\n\n### Rationale\n\nBy analyzing the rate of prize liquidity depletion, the recent deposit metrics, and Aave yields we see that the prize reserves are depleting at around 6k USDC per day.  With the current reserves and outstanding claimable prizes we have around two weeks to zero, all things held equal.  Because of the nature of the cross-chain system, the fluctuating variables in prize liquidity demand, and the time it takes for governance to take action, we should act now to avoid any situation of depositors attempting to claim prizes that are not there to be claimed.\n\nThere will be no change in effective yield generated by the treasury deposits as prize reserves compared to sponsorship.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nTransfer 400000000000 PTaUSDC (0xdd4d117723C257CEe402285D3aCF218E9A8236E1) from Treasury Timelock to Executive-Team Gnosis safe on Ethereum (0xDa63D70332139E6A8eCA7513f4b6E2E0Dc93b693)\n\n## Status\n\nRFC with poll showing consensus here: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/rfc-prize-liquidity/2102\n\nOnchain vote here:\nhttps://vote.pooltogether.com/proposals/34",

      "title": "PTIP 65: Treasury Working Group Second Quarter Renewal",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nThe Treasury Working Group (TWG) was formed after PTIP-46 was passed. Initially, the TWG was funded with 2250 POOL for our first operational quarter, plus 250 POOL for retroactive pay. Now that the TWG’s first operational quarter is complete, members are seeking renewal for a second quarter and a budget request of 12,820 POOL/quarter, as well as 3,000 USDC (1 ETH value) for PTIP gas costs.\n\nIf this PTIP is approved, our second quarter would retroactively begin on Monday (14 March 2022).\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe TWG reviewed our first operational quarter performance and outlined our second quarter deliverables in the (RFC) Treasury Working Group | Second Quarter Renewal forum post.\n\nPer our original proposal, the TWG’s core purpose is to:\n\n* Ensure safety and prudence go into every decision\n* Drive future protocol growth\n* Identify sustainable solutions\n* Present objective data to the community\n\nIn keeping with our core purpose, the TWG will focus on the following high level deliverables, which we’ve identified as top priority for our second quarter:\n1. Exploring protocol-owned liquidity solutions (POL)\n2. Identify new yield sources\n3. Prize tiering, simulation\n4. Non-stablecoin asset management\n5. Leveraging TWAB, Delegated Chance to Win for Growth\n\n### TWG Membership\n\nIn our second operational quarter, @BraveNewDeFi will be the proposed chair and, if approved, he will take on the TWG Chair role. He would be responsible for coordinating communication, posting feedback/comments on the forum, and maintaining close communication with the PoolTogether Inc. team to ensure both the TWG and the protocol are working toward the same goals.\n\nIn our next quarter, the following TWG members will remain as contributors:\n\n* underthesea\n* drcpu\n* TheRealTuna\n* BRONDER\n* BraveNewDeFi (Llama)\n* yuan-han-li (Llama)\n\nWe are also looking for an addition 1-2 members who would like to contribute to the TWG; total membership will likely be between 7-8.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe TWG provides objective analysis and data for any governance proposal or forum post that discusses a potential use of treasury funds. During our first quarter, the TWG provided analysis on POL initiatives, which were shared and noticed outside of the DAO.\n\nMembers of the TWG have played a vital role in governance discussions regarding prize tiering and simulation. In our first quarter, we reviewed stablecoin asset management approaches and proposed PTIP: 54: Treasury Assets Management #1, which was passed by the DAO to add productive assets to our treasury and use USDC to generate interest for prizes in V4. For a full review of our first quarter performance, see the (RFC) Treasury Working Group | Second Quarter Renewal.\n\nFor our proposed second quarter, the TWG will focus on pressing issues for the DAO: namely, POL solutions that don’t come at a significant cost to the protocol and identifying new yield sources to increase yield and reduce the TVL benchmarks PoolTogether needs to reach in order to achieve profitability.\n\nThe TWG will also make some deliverables core duties of the working group, like prize tiering/simulation analysis and asset management. Now that stablecoin assets have been deployed into productive strategies, the TWG will turn our focus to the optimal use of non-stablecoin treasury assets.\n\nWe’ll also work with other working groups within PoolTogether, such as the Marketing Working Group (MWG) to determine how the protocol can leverage the TWAB contract and the mutli-delegator contract to achieve growth in deposits.\n\nIn our second quarter, the TWG will deliver on our core purpose, while providing DAO members with the objective analysis and insight necessary to make informed decisions on treasury-related governance proposals.\n\n## Specification\n\nIn our first quarter, the TWG requested a budget of 2250 POOL/quarter, with an allocation of 750 POOL per month that was distributed via Coordinape. The TWG also requested 250 POOL for our efforts to establish the working group and provide analysis before the working group was passed through governance.\n\nOver the course of our first quarter, 750 POOL were distributed among active contributors each month.\n\nWhen our first budget was requested, POOL was ~$9/POOL. The TWG chose to be paid in POOL to align incentives with the DAO. The total quarterly budget was $20,250 USD, or $6,750/month. During our first quarter, the average contributor received $234 in POOL for their monthly contribution due to the change in POOL prices.\n\nFor our second operational quarter, the TWG is seeking $30,000 in POOL, which is equivalent to 12,820 POOL/quarter, or 4,273.33 POOL/month. We still believe payment in POOL aligns incentives with the community and drives us to work for the betterment of the protocol. An increased allocation to our budget is intended to reduce the churn of contributors and provide incentives for 6-8 contributors, so we can expand the scope of the TWG’s analysis and core duties.\n\nIf this PTIP is approved, our second quarter would retroactively begin on Monday (14 March 2022).\n\n### Compensation for On-Chain Governance Gas Costs\n\n@underthesea spent a total of 0.1574 ETH in gas costs for submitting on-chain proposals on behalf of the TWG. The relevant transactions are included here 1 and here. We request retroactive compensation for underthesea’s gas costs, as submitting on-chain PTIPs was not initially in the scope of the TWG. When we first formed, we were to provide analysis but have no execution power.\n\nGoing forward, the TWG will take on the responsibility for putting votes on-chain in the second operational quarter. There will be additional gas costs associated with submitting on-chain proposals, so we are requesting a 3,000 budget in USDC that will be used to acquire WETH that is held in the TWG multisig; some of this funding will go to reimbursing underthesea, as well. Any WETH that is not used for executing on-chain proposals will be returned to the treasury or rolled over at the end of the operational quarter.\n\n### TWG Gnosis Safe on Ethereum\n\nIn the TWG’s first quarter, funding was directed from the Polygon Executive multisig, which was on Polygon. Since this distribution will be on mainnet, funds will be held in a 3/5 Gnosis Safe with the following signers:\n\n* BraveNewDefi - 0x06223C0093Fc9FC872C8968BF13a15AE18f2484f\n* BRONDER - 0x3bc1158e5bcE8c10e5DA0EdFBB94b261eec46A76\n* underthesea - 0x93146d9978d286EE085ba68eE1786a0b6EDA64EC\n* drcpu - 0xC734011dBd90677eb42C0F93827665F0ddaed46F\n* TheRealTuna - 0xa31c2232842e631cCb2d2E4110B356Bab21E6020\n\nPTIP gas reimbursement and Coordinape funding will be distributed from this multisig. \n\n### Technical Specification\n\n1) Withdraw 3000000000 PTaUSDC from the prize pool\n2) Transfer 3000000000 USDC to TWG multisig\n3) Transfer 12820000000000000000000 POOL to TWG multisig\n\nTWG multisig address: 0xB74659A1011F6DCA3BA6F6e22a71bA8f414F36A1\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Do you approve continued funding of the PoolGrants program?\n\nGovernance post: https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-62-grants-committee-funding-q4/2058\nOn-chain vote: https://vote.pooltogether.com/proposals/32\n\nSummary\nThe PoolGrants program was created through PTIP-14: PoolTogether Grants Committee 1. In PTIP-48 2, governance approved an identical budget ($500k/Quarter) as in PTIP-14 for Q3 and Q4. In order to limit the funds at risk in the multisig wallets, only Q3 funds were transferred to the PoolGrants wallet. Now that Q3 has concluded, governance is requested to approve the transfer of budget funds to PoolGrants for Q4, which runs from 2/19/2022 to 5/18/2022.\n\nQ3 review\nPoolGrants Q3 was much more focused on funding and empowering projects from within the community, rather than external initiatives.\n\nHighlights include the community substack, coordinape and underthesea’s quality of life projects, such as poolexplorer.win 2 and wheresthedrip.com 1.\n\nWe also supported delegation experiments such as NFT Christmas cards and the Valentine’s delegation NFT giveaway.\nThese were enormously successful and from now on we plan to have 100k USDC earmarked for delegation initiatives on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe look forward to supporting more awesome community projects like these in Q4!\n\nSpecification\nIn Q3, we funded grants to the amount of $88.5k and spent $15.6k on committee wages and gas expenses.\n\nAt present, the committee multisigs hold about $41k worth of POOL (@$2.44) and 142k USDC, across Ethereum and Polygon. We have $60k committed to open grant milestones. Consistent with the plan and soft consensus reached in PTIP-48, PoolGrants requests the transfer of 85.6k POOL (worth $209k) and 108k PTaUSDC from the PoolTogether treasury to the PoolGrants Ethereum multisig wallet, to restore it to a total of $500k as budgeted.\n\nThe POOL amount is so high because the POOL we received for Q3 has depreciated a lot in value since then.\n\nTransparency\nAs we are funded by PoolTogether governance, it is important that PoolGrants operations are transparent. You can find our transparency resources below. If there is anything you would like to see improved in this area, please let us know.\n\n• Medium articles & updates 2\n\n• Complete list of funded projects 4\n\n• Committee time tracking 1\n\nTechnical specification\n• Transfer 85’600 POOL ($209k) from the PoolTogether treasury to the PoolGrants Ethereum multisig wallet.\n\n• Transfer 108’000 PTaUSDC from the PoolTogether treasury to the PoolGrants Ethereum multisig wallet.\n\nPoolGrants’ Ethereum multisig wallet address: 0xd605bB8A3DA1f7f777276D3c97c828aAc3Dd4252",

This TRIBE will be then staked to earn around 29% return.\n\nApart from those transactions, this PTIP will also withdraw $16K USDT on Polygon from PoolTogether V3 Reserve and swap it to USDC. Afterwards it will be deposited as prize liquidity into V4 (not delegated to any address). These transactions will be done by the Executive Team.\n\n## Motivation\n\nFor a long time PoolTogether Treasury assets have been sitting on V3. This incentivizes prizes on V3 while also generating some yield for the PoolTogether protocol. PoolTogether V4 has now been live for almost 4 months now, however, we have not shifted the attention of Treasury funds to V4.\n\nBy moving sponsorship funds from V3 to V4 we will increase the TVL and invite more users to use V4 instead of V3. Apart from that, we will also earn a higher yield for the treasury, as all the amount earned will be directly received by the treasury.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nThis proposal will withdraw the current USDC and DAI reserves, as well as the USDC sponsorship, and move those to V4 ($3,790K USDC) and Aave ($480K DAI).\n\n### Rationale\n\nMultiple protocols have been discussed as valid alternatives to deposit PoolTogether Treasury funds into. As outlined in this governance forum post (https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/treasury-assets-management-1/1989), after a previous analysis Aave has been picked to deposit around 12% of the stablecoins, while the rest is put in PoolTogether V4.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nOn-chain transactions to be performed:\n\n1. Withdraw $2,842K scUSDC from V3 Sponsorship\n2. Withdraw $948K USDC from V3 Reserve\n3. Withdraw $480K DAI from V3 Reserve\n4. Approve USDC in V4\n5. Deposit $3,790K USDC in V4 (not delegated to any address)\n6. Approve $482k DAI on Aave\n7. Deposit DAI on Aave\n8. Transfer 36,467 TRIBE to executive multi-sig\n",

We strongly encourage you to check out the grants we funded in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth month. PTIP-14 laid out the creation of the PoolGrants program with a two-quarter pilot program. This PTIP aims to extend the program for another 6 month period.\n\nThe committee multisigs currently hold about $155k worth of POOL (@$10) and 196k USDC, across Ethereum and Polygon. We have $67k committed to open grant milestones that have not been paid out and wages and expenses for last month will be another $11k. This leaves us with $273k that will roll over. For the third quarter we are applying for $173k in POOL and $54k in USDC in additional funding, to bring us back to a total of $500k as outlined in PTIP-14. Any amount left over at the end of the third quarter will again be rolled over to the fourth quarter’s funding.\nApproving this PTIP is meant to signal intent to fund both quarter 3 and 4. The budget for quarter 4 will be requested at the end of quarter 3 through a separate PTIP, in order to limit the funds available in the multisigs at any given time.\n\nTechnical specification\nTransfer 17’000 POOL ($170’000) POOL from treasury to PoolGrants multisig.\nTransfer 54’000 ScUSDC from treasury to PoolGrants multisig.\nMultisig’s address: 0xd605bB8A3DA1f7f777276D3c97c828aAc3Dd4252\n\nFull Proposal:\nhttps://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-48-grants-committee-funding-season-2/1754",

      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal will transfer $250k USDC to Code 423n4 to continue our partnership.\n\n## Abstract\n\n$250k USDC will be withdrawn from V3 USDC pool sponsorship and transferred to the C4 team (0xC2bc2F890067C511215f9463a064221577a53E10).  This extends the relationship started in [PTIP-30: Long-Term Partnership with C4](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-30-long-term-partnership-with-c4/1388)\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe PoolTogether protocol is continually evolving.  As a result, we have a steady stream of new smart contract code.  Any code that holds user funds MUST be audited by a third party before being pushed into production.\n\nPoolTogether has been partnered with Code 423n4 for audits, and they've been doing a great job.  This proposal deepens the relationship by topping up PoolTogether's account with fresh funds.\n\n## Specification\n\n- This proposal will withdraw and transfer funds to C4\n- PoolTogether Inc. will continue to manage the scope of work and auditing pipeline.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\n- Withdraw $250k sponsorship from V3 USDC pool\n- Transfer $250k USDC to 0xC2bc2F890067C511215f9463a064221577a53E10",

      "content": "# PTIP-41: Operations Overhaul\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal will increase the budget for the ops team and reduce operations costs.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal will:\n\n- Cancel the existing Sablier 100k stream of ScUSDC\n- Create a new Sablier stream of ScUSDC of ~330k ScUSDC over one year\n- Do an up-front transfer of $40k ScUSDC to bootstrap the Ops budget.\n- Replace UNI and COMP RNG services with blockhash\n- Remove the gassy Loot Box integration from the USDC, DAI, UNI and COMP prize pools.\n\n## Motivation\n\nWith the rise in Ethereum gas prices, the Ethereum Operations Team does not have sufficient budget to run the prize pools.  Last week we had gas costs of ~2.23 ETH, or approximately $8600 USD.  We need much, much more in weekly budget.\n\nWe can reduce gas costs by removing some dead features and by reducing LINK costs for pools that don't need it.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Rationale\n\n- $10k / week, along with optimizations, should cover the weekly costs.  This would come from the old stream ($190k left) + new stream ($330k).\n- The loot box NFT is no longer being used, so we can strip it out entirely.  This should save ~150k gas.\n- The UNI and COMP prizes are low enough that a blockhash is sufficient for RNG.  This will save 4 LINK per week.",

      "content": "### Simple Summary\nContinue POOL distribution. Lower distribution rates on Dai and USDC prize pools. Begin using a portion of each week’s reserves to buy back POOL.\n\n### Motivation\nImprove overall tokenomics by optimizing POOL distribution rates and initiating a POOL buy back. This also sets the stage to more aggressively build prize pools on Polygon where lower gas costs enable more users.\n\n### Overview\nThe second period of POOL distribution is ending in the next ~10 days. This proposal:\n\n- Renews POOL distribution at the same rate for COMP, UNI, POOL, and SUSHI prize pools.\n- Decreases the distribution rate for USDC and Dai prize pools by 29% each, in aggregate this reduces total daily emissions by 20%. Details here 3.\n- Begins using 75% of weekly reserves intake to buy back POOL (~$2,500 - $3,500 daily).\n\n### Rationale\n#### POOL Distribution Rates\nThe majority of POOL distribution is going to the Dai and USDC prize pools. Reducing those two prize pools by 29% each amounts to a reduction in total daily POOL emissions of 20%. The last reduction in distribution rates had a positive effect and the goal is to achieve a similar effect now (maintain deposited value while lowering POOL distributed). This reduction also us to begin using POOL incentives on Polygon where lower transaction fees attract many more users.\n\n#### Improving Incentives\nPTIP-25 doubled the rewards for POOL depositors. This proposal builds on the theme of improving incentives for POOL holders by using a portion of the reserves accrued each week to buy back POOL. This POOL can then be sent to be distributed to POOL pool depositors. This will serve as a short term improvement well Llama DAO does more in depth research (PTIP-26 1) on larger adjustments.\n\nDue to the fact that Llama DAO research is pending a larger changes are anticipated in the near future the initial implementation of the POOL buy back will be manually via a 2 of 3 multi-signature wallet with @TheRealTuna, @RegisIsland, @underthesea as signers. This proposal will fund the wallet with USDC and buy backs will be carried out. This will be a short term solution while larger changes are evaluated.\n\n### Technical Specification\nThe technical specification lays out the technical details of what is being proposed. This may include:\n\n- Transfer POOL to UNI, COMP prize pools to maintain POOL distribution at current rate\n\n- Transfer pPOOL to the SUSHI prize pool to maintain distribution at the current rate\n\n- Decrease USDC daily distribution rate from 1,400 to 1,000 POOL\n\n- Decrease Dai daily distribution rate from 700 to 500 POOL\n\n- Adjust COMP reserve rate from 100% to 99% (house-keeping change for improved user experience)\n\n- Transfer $100,000 USDC to buy-back multi-sig",

Also adjust the COMP reserve as the COMP earned is a greater prize than the interest earned.\n\n**Specification**\nThis proposal will:\nIncrease POOL pool drip to 200 POOL per day.\n~~Add a 50 POOL per day drip to the GUSD pool~~\n~~Set the reserve rate on the GUSD pool to 10%~~\nAdd a 50 POOL per day drip to the Sushi pool\nSet the reserve rate on the sushi pool to 25%\nAdjust the reserve rate on the COMP pool to 100%\n\n**Overview**\nThese changes shall get us by until we revisit the distribution rates at the end of July.\n\n**Rationale**\nPOOL pool depositors are a very loyal group to the protocol and deserve earning a higher drip. This increase in drip can also help attract those earning POOL in the other pools to retain their POOL tokens and use them to earn more POOL instead of potentially selling them off. POOL pool APR should be in line with that of the deposit pools and the goal is also to attract more POOL pool depositors.\n\nGUSD is a new pool that we should be trying to grow and allowing depositors to earn POOL is the best path to growth. This pool also earns Aave for the protocol and that is the reasoning for not applying the standard 50% reserve that is used in the Compound pools.\n\nSushi pool sushi rewards end soon and in anticipation of continuing the pool we should set a new reserve rate and drip 50 POOL per day to maintain the pool.\n\nMost of the Compound prize comes from the Compound rewards. As discussed in the community call we should adjust the reserve rate to 100%.\n\nhttps://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-25-pool-pool-boost-and-gusd-drip/1285/2#simple-summary-2",

      "title": "PTIP-24: Revised saving the little fish (phase 1)",
      "content": "See [PTIP-24](https://vote.pooltogether.com/proposals/17)\n\n## Simple Summary\n\n* Split the accrued COMP evenly across all winners.\n* Increase the number of weekly prize winners on Dai prize pool from 3 to 5 \n* Increase the number of weekly prize winners on POOL pool prize pool from 1 to 5\n\n## Motivation\n\nNot enough small depositors are winning prizes. For PoolTogether to scale to the next level of growth (billions AUM / millions in weekly prizes) we have to find a way to get more people winning prizes. Especially people who have smaller deposits (10k or less). This needs to be done while keeping the protocol simple and not driving away the large depositors which create the large prizes.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis PTIP would do three things:\n\n1. Increase the number of weekly winners to the following\n  Dai Prize Pool: From 3 to 5 winners\n  POOL prize pool: from 1 to 5 winners\n\n2. Instead of giving all the accrued COMP to the “grand prize” winner, split the accrued COMP among all winners equally for all prize pools (Dai, USDC, COMP, UNI)\n\n### Overview\n\nThis should be considered phase 1 of Operation Little Fish. This phase uses the levers immediately at the control of governance (i.e. no new solidity code written). It will meaningfully adjust the odds to favor smaller depositors by. **Phase 2 is in R&D and will expand on this same goal.**\n\nNOTE: the same wallet can win multiple prizes. So large whales will still win many of the prizes but far less of the total prizes than today.\n\n### Rationale\n\nPoolTogether is currently a victim of its own success. With over $200 million deposited, $100,000+ in weekly prizes, and prize pool reserves growing things are going better than ever. BUT, deposits into the prize pools have become increasingly dominated by large depositors. We’ve gone from the majority of prizes being won by large depositors to almost all of them being won by large whales. We need more depositors like the person [who deposited $73 and won $43,000. ](https://medium.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-myths-6d1a91d283a0) The core value proposition of PoolTogether is giving people the chance to get an outsized return on their money without risking it. Having more prizes means the odds of winning increase and this value proposition becomes stronger. PoolTogether becomes more FUN.\n\nThe change to the POOL pool to emphasize staking APR over a weekly prize also helps improve returns for POOL hodlers.\n\nThere are other methods to achieve this goal that the community has discussed. Specifically the idea of moving the POOL incentive to “sponsored” deposits that are not eligible to win. This idea has merit (I’ve been a proponent of it) but has some key limitations.\n\n* Adding a second token “drip” will increase gas costs for all users (TBD on exactly how much)\n* We will likely still have whales winning all the prizes, the whales will have the same % of total deposits but a smaller deposit in absolute numbers\n* We risk losing a lot of capital in the migration\n* We lose the benefits of having the value propo of “a chance to win + an APR” for depositors\n* The value prop of sponsorship becomes solely yield farming which is not competitive for us long term\n\nUltimately this is the simplest change to immediately and meaningfully help out small depositors. Phase 2 of the operation will expand on this same goal.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nAll these changes are simply parameter adjustments. This proposal pushes the limits of the current architecture and prepares us for phase 2.\n\n## Status\n\nThis proposal was [extensively discussed and supported widely here](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-22-operation-10x-saving-the-little-fishes-phase-1/1250). As such this will go to vote",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis Snapshot proposal combines PTIP-16 and PTIP-17.  Details below!\n\n# PTIP-16: C4 Audit Proposal\n\nThis proposal will fund a [Code Arena](https://code423n4.com/) (C4) contest to audit the critical components of the PoolTogether codebase as well as new yield sources.\n\nThe audit is tentatively scheduled for June 16, but it's first-come first-served so it depends on how quickly we can run this PTIP.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal will transfer 72k USDC to the C4 team to fund the contest.\n\n## Motivation\n\nPoolTogether is continually evolving and expanding.  New smart contracts are being written and existing contracts are updated.  With these changes some significant risk.  Any smart contract that holds or has access to user funds is mission critical and must be scrutinized before being deployed.  Scrutiny must come from someone with deep knowledge of the relevant protocols as well as an understanding of smart contract attack surfaces.  Auditing firms specialize in this knowledge, so they are extremely valuable in de-risking smart contracts.\n\nThe core PoolTogether codebase has received third party audits from both OpenZeppelin and Diligence.  Both are great firms, and we’ve had positive experiences with them.  However, auditing firms are in short supply and lead times are now very long.  Additionally, our protocol has a steady stream of new smart contracts that need to be audited.  The classic ‘waterfall’ model of auditing the entire system in one shot no longer fits our process.  We also need an auditing firm that is willing to deal directly with protocols.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nThis PTIP funds the first C4 auditing contest for PoolTogether.  The scope of this contest includes several of the critical core PT contracts, as well as yield sources:\n\nCore PoolTogether contracts:\n\n- [YieldSourcePrizePool.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-pool-contracts/blob/cbec82befa502500c63b59a9d0dabd678d3dd508/contracts/prize-pool/yield-source/YieldSourcePrizePool.sol)\n- [StakePrizePool.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-pool-contracts/blob/cbec82befa502500c63b59a9d0dabd678d3dd508/contracts/prize-pool/stake/StakePrizePool.sol)\n- [ControlledToken.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-pool-contracts/blob/cbec82befa502500c63b59a9d0dabd678d3dd508/contracts/token/ControlledToken.sol)\n- [Ticket.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-pool-contracts/blob/cbec82befa502500c63b59a9d0dabd678d3dd508/contracts/token/Ticket.sol)\n\nYield sources:\n\n- [ATokenYieldSource.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/aave-yield-source/blob/bc65c875f62235b7af55ede92231a495ba091a47/contracts/yield-source/ATokenYieldSource.sol) (Aave V2 Integration)\n- [YearnV2YieldSource.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-yearnv2-yield-source/blob/a34857f1555908a6263d2ebd189f0cb40e1858da/contracts/yield-source/YearnV2YieldSource.sol) (Yearn V2 integration)\n- [SushiYieldSource.sol](https://github.com/pooltogether/pooltogether-yearnv2-yield-source/blob/a34857f1555908a6263d2ebd189f0cb40e1858da/contracts/yield-source/SushiYieldSource.sol) (SushiBar integration)\n- [IdleYieldSource.sol](https://github.com/sunnyRK/IdleYieldSource-PoolTogether/blob/6dcc419e881a4f0f205c07c58f4db87520b6046d/contracts/IdleYieldSource.sol) (Idle Finance integration)\n- Badger wBTC Yield Source (TBD)\n\nCode Arena has scoped the contest and recommends a 50-70k USD prize pot.  We’re going to put up 60k USDC for prizes, and allocate 10k of the pot to optimizations.  C4 takes 20% on top of the prizes to cover the cost of judging and administration.  That makes the total 72k USDC.\n\n### Rationale\n\n[Code Arena](https://code423n4.com/)  takes a community-driven approach to competitive smart contract audits. A contest is created for a codebase; there is a pot of funds for exploits, and another for optimizations.  Anyone can privately submit exploits to the contest and a skilled expert, the “judge”, curates the exploits into a final audit report.  The prizes are split among all who contributed to the audit report.  This has some major advantages:\n\n- Less resource-constrained\n- Builds a knowledgeable community around participating protocols\n\nTo bootstrap the C4 community’s knowledge of PoolTogether, we should start with a comprehensive up-front audit.  Once the knowledge has been seeded, we can start running more frequent flash contests; wherein a small piece of code (think: yield source) can have a short, dedicated contest.  I think this would be a great fit for our iterative process.\n\nIdeally, flash contests can be funded by the PT Grants Committee.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\nUSDC.transfer(0xC2bc2F890067C511215f9463a064221577a53E10, 72000000000)\n\n# PTIP-17\n\nDeposit the $4.8 million of USDC currently sitting in the [timelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0x42cd8312D2BCe04277dD5161832460e95b24262E) contract into the sponsorship of the USDC prize pool. For voting purposes, combine this action with PTIP-16. \n\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis $4.2 million USDC was deposited into the time lock contract as part of the treasury diversification. It was suppose to be transferred in sponsorship tokens (in fact $1.15 million of it was) but due to transfer security constraints the remainder was not transferred as sponsorship. \n\nTransferring into sponsorship simply means this USDC will be contributing value to the protocol and growing larger prizes while we decide what else we may want to use it for. \n\n## Technical Specification \nUSDC Pool = 0xde9ec95d7708b8319ccca4b8bc92c0a3b70bf416\nUSDC = 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48\n\nUSCD.approve(USDC Pool, 4728000000000)\nUSDCPool.depositTo(\n0x42cd8312D2BCe04277dD5161832460e95b24262E,\n4728000000000,\n0x391a437196c81eEa7BBbBd5ED4DF6b49De4F5c96,\n0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n)\n",

      "title": "PTIP-15: POOL Distribution",
      "content": "See the [original post on Discourse](https://gov.pooltogether.com/t/ptip-15-reduced-continued-pool-distribution/1093)\n\nThis Snapshot proposal is for both [Part 1](https://vote.pooltogether.com/proposals/13) and [Part 2](https://vote.pooltogether.com/proposals/14)\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal is to continue POOL distribution to governance managed prize pools at a reduced rate. If not passed, POOL distribution will completely stop on May 26th. \n\n## Motivation\n\nThe initial POOL distribution period has been quite successful in\n\n* Generating ~$200,000 in weekly prizes\n* Growing AUM to ~$230 million\n* Growing reserves by $75,000 - $150,000 weekly (depending on interest rates)\n\nHowever, since this POOL distribution was set before the POOL token was issued. It has never been optimized using the real world data we now have. The initial POOL distribution was outlined here and was designed to [distribute 5% of the total supply over 14 weeks](https://medium.com/pooltogether/introducing-pool-23b09f36db48).  \n\nThis proposal continues POOL distribution at a substantially reduced rate. The goal of this proposal is to optimize POOL distribution to generate the largest prizes and getting POOL into the hands of long term aligned community members.  \n\n## Specification\n\n- Extend POOL distribution for 14 more weeks at the following rates \n- Reduce USDC POOL distribution from 2,295 per day to 1,400\n- Reduce Dai POOL distribution from 2,295 per day to 700\n- Reduce COMP distribution from 255 per day to 50 \n- Reduce UNI distribution from 255 per day to 50\n- Increase LP reward distribution from 300 to 500 POOL per day \n\nOverall, these changes reduce total daily POOL distribution by 49%. Maintaining these rates fo 14 weeks will distribute a total of 274,400 POOL. It should be communicated that we expect POOL distribution to continue after those 14 weeks but there may be modifications to it.   \n\n\n### Rationale\n\nThere are many variables involved in setting POOL distribution rates so it's impossible to fully know what the impact will be. However, a few over-arching ideas guided our thinking. \n\n- POOL distribution had to be slowed for the simple reason that it began with a VERY fast distribution rate. The initial distribution rate was optimized for getting as much POOL as possible into the hands of the community (5% of total supply over 14 weeks). \n* The yield rates on assets are highly varied. Targeting high yield assets with POOL distribution leads to larger prizes and faster reserve growth. Targeting low yield assets helps grow AUM but doesn’t contribute significantly to prizes.\n* POOL distribution is equal across similar asset types (stable coins both get the same rate) this fragments prizes and prevents the growth of really large headline prizes ($1 million per week).\n\nWith these high level ideas we landed on the following parameters\n\n- A total 49% reduction in POOL distributed per day\n- The largest cuts 80% were to the non-stablecoin prize pools which have the lowest APRs and therefore smallest prizes \n- USDC receives the highest allocation of 1,400 POOL (2x that of Dai) this creates a clear favorite pool that can be the primary entry point to new depositors and also provide the highest headline prize.\n- An increase in LP incentives to POOL / ETH holders of 200 POOL (500 per day instead of 300 per day) which should incentive healthier liquidity for POOL \n\nYou can [see the details of the changes along with other variables here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/149njhQ1gA9kVOLLLzGvUhoTL3NVtzIf-fDHXnPuUhmw/edit#gid=784369451). \n\nIt's worth noting a few things this proposal does not do. \n\n- The proposal does not re-allocate any POOL specifically to incentive sponsorship over deposits. This has been a popular idea as a way to have less whales win prizes but it was deemed too big of a change to implement right now alongside the other changes. \n- This proposal does not change pool reserve rates. It was decided it was best to address this separately.\n\n \n### Technical Specification\n\nThis proposal exceeds the current 10 transaction limit of proposals, so it will be split into two parts:\n\nPart 1: Reduce Drip Rates\nPart 2: Deposit more POOL\n",
