Each stream will start vesting only when the recipient claims it from the airstream campaign, and the vesting period will be 1 year. The `$ANT` holders will get 3 months to claim their airstream. Unclaimed airstreams will be returned to the Nation3 DAO.\n\nThere are 12,080 `$ANT` holders as of today. So 14,023 `$NATION` tokens evenly distributed per account would equal ~1.16 `$NATION` per `$ANT` holder.\n\nThe ethos of the Nation3 [Manifesto](https://nation3.org/manifesto) is that we need to re-imagine nation states so that people can enjoy increased freedom, wealth and fairness. This is in many ways similar to the [Aragon Manifesto](https://blog.aragon.org/the-aragon-manifesto-4a21212eac03/).

A budget will not be transferred until the work has been completed.\n\nPlanned tasks for the _🧙 Development Guild_ for Q2 2024:\n- Deploy `BoostedLiquidityDistributor.sol` to Mainnet and reinstate liquidity rewards program.\n- Install Aragon OSx governance plugin for DAO Agent (`nation3agent.dao.eth`) and DAO Critical Agent (`nation3.dao.eth`).\n- Deploy Basic Income for Nation3 Citizens (\"N3BI\") smart contract, and fund 1 year's worth of basic income for active citizens.\n- Start working on a product that can generate a sustainable stream of usage fees to the Basic Income smart contract.\n- Add improvements to the [Nation3 Agreements](https://agreements.nation3.org/) system.\n- Deploy smart contract for autonomously distributing weekly SourceCred grain 🌾 distributions.\n- Finalize any pending tasks for transforming Nation3 into a truly Decentralized and truly Autonomous organization.",

Instead we will use [Hedgey](https://hedgey.finance/) Time Locks.\n\nWe can set a default time lock duration.

Discord admin\n1. DAO e-mail address\n1. DAO password manager\n1. DAO Critical Agent multisig owner\n1. GitHub organization member\n1. Supabase team administrator\n1. Twitter account\n1. Coordinape Circle member\n1. Dework manager\n\nBy adjusting the DAO Critical Agent multisig from 3/5 to 4/6, we require 66.67% voting support.  This will also be a better representation of the current Nation3 [Constitution](https://github.com/nation3/law/blob/main/Constitution.linked.md):\n> Critical Impact Proposal Voting Support : 66%\n\n**Note:** Since the whole point of N3GOV-49 is to decentralize the Nation3 governance structure, having the Transition Committee control the DAO Critical Agent contract is only a _temporary_ measure.  As soon as we have coded and deployed an Aragon OSx smart contract, the DAO Critical Agent address will be changed to the new address, and the governance power held by the Transition Committee will be dissolved.\n\nGovernance pull request: https://github.com/nation3/gov-proposals/pull/72",

      "content": "## Introduction\n\nA recent proposal was made to [withdraw all funds](https://forum.nation3.org/t/n3gov-48-merge-towards-endgoal/930) from the Nation3 DAO and incorporate a traditional centralized company in Switzerland—_The Network State Company AG_.  22 of 27 Nation3 citizens [voted no](https://snapshot.org/#/nation3.eth/proposal/0x14c2ac7363e4149d2169b53c1fc3acfc7a6ca0cdf92ee49f747ea8d49958ee2e) to this.\n\nSince the majority of the Nation3 citizens have indicated that they want Nation3 to be a _decentralized_ organization (DAO), the founders have [announced](https://forum.nation3.org/t/n3gov-48-merge-towards-endgoal/930/6) that they will be leaving the Nation3 DAO, and return their tokens. And they will hand over access to all systems/infrastructure to the DAO so that it can continue operating.\n\nThe founders have generously offered their time to help make this transition as smooth as possible.\n\n### Nation3's Vision ☁️\n\nLet's start by reminding ourselves why Nation3 exists in the first place: We value _freedom_.\n\nIn our lifetime, we have observed many cases of governments abusing their power. In recent years we have seen the [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_Hong_Kong_protests) government killing 15 protesters and arresting more than 10,000. And following the [Myanmar military coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_protests_(2021%E2%80%93present)), the government killed 3,770 young protesters and 19,413 are currently detained. And the list goes on...\n\n![1380x770.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeihl2ocpdvnjlcbzu53jjcxlytspkangmkmjzkjzw5l3jhrob2sgcy)\n    \nThis young generation _sacrificed their lives_ to stand up against their violent government. These are the real heroes.\n\nThey are our fellow humans. Our brothers and sisters. And they need our help right now.\n\n---\n\n> \"In the months before the Myanmar military’s coup, the country’s telecom and internet service providers were ordered to install intercept spyware that would allow the army to eavesdrop on the communications of citizens.\"\n\n> \"The technology gives the military the power to listen in on calls, view text messages and web traffic including e-mails and track the locations of users without the assistance of the telecom and internet firms, the sources said.\"\n\nHow can Nation3 help?\n\nThe ethos of the Nation3 [Manifesto](https://www.nation3.org/manifesto) is that we need to re-imagine nation states so that people can enjoy increased freedom, wealth and fairness.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis proposal aims to launch _two_ new experiments into the world instead of only one. Instead of the founders leaving to work on a merged entity with Baseflow (an OS for sovereign individuals) and the Nation3 DAO being abandoned, we can launch two new technological experiments simultaneously:\n\n![mermaid.png](ipfs://bafkreic45mpiiu4z7cpm34qzfdb667usj3bkeplhhaclo2d3popt5uvn6y)\n\nWith two experiments running at the same time, we will increase our chances of finding the technology that puts a real dent in the universe.\n\nWhile the founders will get going on a new innovation targeting sovereign individuals, Nation3 will target people who are _not yet_ sovereign individuals and therefore still not free from their government.\n\n### Bottoms-Up Idea Competition 💡\n\nThe best ideas can come from anyone. So the Nation3 DAO will run an _idea competition_, accepting innovative technology idea submissions from both citizens and outside collaborators. The competition will come with some restraints:\n\n1. Ideas must adhere to the vision in the Nation3 [Manifesto](https://www.nation3.org/manifesto).\n1. Ideas will likely be restricted to a geographical target market.\n1. Ideas incorporating freedom-enabling technologies (Internet, cryptography, blockchain, open source) will be favored.\n\nAll idea submissions will then be put up for democratic voting by Nation3's citizens, and the work on the chosen technology will be organized as a sub-DAO—the _Nation3 Engineering DAO_. As the name implies, this sub-DAO will only consist of engineers, fully focused on building the technology, and will not be spending their time on other projects related to Nation3.\n\n### Technological Review 🔍\n\nAs Nation3 citizen #71 suggested, a manual review and approval of the chosen innovation idea will need to be done. _First_ upon selection of the top voted idea, and _secondly_ upon reviewing proposals for its implementation. Once reviewed and passed as technologically solid and potentially impactful (aligned with the Nation3 [Manifesto](https://www.nation3.org/manifesto)'s vision), funding will be transferred to the Nation3 Engineering DAO for the work to begin.\n\n### DAO vs Traditional Organization ⚖️\n\nWhile DAOs are expected to be the future of work and to enable global and highly efficient collaboration, they are still going through a chaotic and evolving phase. We can expect them to mature and flourish a few years from now, but they are still inefficient compared to traditional companies.\n\nThis is why it makes sense for Nation3's founding team to leave the DAO and start another technological innovation in the form of a fast and efficient traditional organization.\n\nIf we want to see a paradigm shift towards a more free, open, and fair society, *we need to experiment fast*. Coercive governments also have access to technology, so we need to move faster than they do. Technological innovation requires rapid experimentation. We don't have time to waste.\n\n## Execution Plan\n\n### 1. Decentralize the Nation3 Governance Structure 🗳️\n\nNation3 will transition towards a more [decentralized](https://forum.nation3.org/t/temperature-check-decentralize-nation3/933) and autonomous organization structure, following the ethos of DAOs:\n\n1. Transition to a flat and fully democratized governance structure (1-citizen 1-vote) for the top-level Nation3 DAO\n1. Introduce autonomous Nation3 sub-DAOs where builders govern themselves (while keeping activity public)\n1. Transition from off-chain to on-chain governance\n1. Transition from private activity to fully public activity\n\n### 2. Handover of Admin Access to the DAO ⚙️\n\nThis work is already in progress (thanks to @0xGallego), and you can follow the progress in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nation3-690584551239581708) or in the [forum](https://forum.nation3.org/t/a-list-of-nation3-systems-services-accounts/938).\n\n1. A _Transition Committee_ will be responsible for receiving and maintaining admin access to the Nation3 systems: @TonyStark, @JohnMark13, @aahna, @rencai201, @AbuUsama.\n1. Establish solution for billing services.\n1. Enable a solution for the DAO to edit the list of people with admin access to the systems.\n\n#### Change ownership of DAO smart contracts\n\n##### DAO Critical Agent Address\n- Change from `0x7B81e8D4e82796c9B76284Fa4d21E57b8B86A06c` (Aragon Client) to `0x7fFf737ae9FdDD6E28Fe8B8F0F4dE69Bb8e7a885` (Safe multisig).\n\n##### DAO Agent Address\n- Change from `0x336252602b3a8A0bE336ED942228305173E8082B` (Aragon Client) to `0xD1EDE41DeB03A23CCB325312DE8e5BF240881f53` (Aragon Govern).\n\nThe above amendment of the Constitution can be seen here: [https://github.com/nation3/law/pull/7](https://github.com/nation3/law/pull/7)\n\nCorresponding `gov-proposals` pull request: [https://github.com/nation3/gov-proposals/pull/70](https://github.com/nation3/gov-proposals/pull/70)\n\n#### Transfer of `$NATION` Tokens\n\n- All the 27,275 `$NATION` tokens in the [previous agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x336252602b3a8a0be336ed942228305173e8082b) contract will be transferred to the [new critical agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7fFf737ae9FdDD6E28Fe8B8F0F4dE69Bb8e7a885) contract.\n  - This represents ~65% of the total token supply.\n- The 8,414 `$NATION` founding member tokens will be transferred to the [new agent](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd1ede41deb03a23ccb325312de8e5bf240881f53) contract.\n  - This represents 20% of the total token supply.\n\nAll five members of the _Transition Committee_ will then be added as owners of the Safe multisig (new critical agent).  This will be a _temporary_ measure until we deploy new Aragon OSx DAO contracts governed by all Nation3 citizens.\n\n### 3. Launch of a New Technological Innovation 🚀\n\nTo engage its citizens, the Nation3 DAO will publish a competition, vote on the ideas, and implement the chosen technology.\n\n1. Arrange public idea competition (promotion through Twitter, Discord, etc).\n1. Pick ideas meeting the guidelines, and have Nation3 citizens vote on their favorite.\n1. Recruit 2 or 3 full-time engineers with cryptography knowledge and willingness to work in an open DAO structure.\n1. Run a 1-year project to build the technology.",

      "title": "N3GOV-48: Merge towards endgoal",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nWhen launching Nation3, the idea was to leverage Web3’s capital formation to accumulate a massive treasury that would allow the community to negotiate a favorable deal with a host country and create a new nation state.\n\nAs the crypto bear market came (and other events like the FTX collapse), any glimpse of such treasury has been erased.\n\nThe first pivot was then to creating the internet’s legal system, powered by Nation3’s checks and balances.\n\nAfter thorough analysis and a deep dive on the problem and solutions space (posted on #agora on Discord), such quest seems overly complicated, with many risky assumptions and ultimately getting us further from the idea of creating a network state.\n\n[Baseflow](https://baseflow.io) is an OS for sovereign individuals, allowing them to acquire residencies and citizenships with ease, and move where they are treated best.\n\nSuch funnel and community of sovereign individuals, as well as close ties with government agents, can be leveraged as a launchpad to negotiate Special Economic Zones with host countries. **That was the original idea for Nation3, and we believe it is still the right path to pursue**. \n\nA merge with Baseflow would ensure the continuity of such endeavor. Baseflow’s short-term goal is to help sovereign individuals acquire citizenships and residencies with the governments that treat them best. Nation3’s long-term goal is to create Special Economic Zones where they are treated best.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- A new legal entity to be incorporated in Zug, Switzerland (The Network State Company AG).\n- All funds (directly or over time for vested ones) to be transferred to `networkstateco.eth`.\n- Aragon Ecosystem Association (Aragon DAO’s legal wrapper), the only entity that purchased tokens from the Nation3 DAO (via a swap), will be given a proportional amount of shares in The Network State Company, once incorporated.\n- All **citizens with valid passports** (>2 $veNATION balance) at block 17690000 are allowed to participate in The Network State Company at the valuation of the merge. Such valuation is the sum of Baseflow Inc.’s valuation plus the Nation3 valuation that the Aragon token swap was done at ($52.069m total valuation). $veNATION holdings, at 1 $veNATION = $100 (roughly market price at writing time) are taken into account for their investment. In other words, a citizen holding 2 $veNATION would get $200 worth of shares *“for free”*. The minimum ticket is $2,500 (otherwise KYC and other processes aren’t worth it). Founder tokens and tokens from AEA are excluded from participating (since that would be double participation). Although the Nation3 DAO never sold $NATION to citizens or others (apart from AEA), and instead did a massive token airdrop (giving away **more than $10m in tokens**), we feel this **allows aligned citizens to continue being involved**, while filtering away those who don’t.\n- $NATION and other smart contracts will continue existing, they are permissionless and cannot stop. The Nation3 Constitution will still be in effect, and the Nation3 DAO won’t lose sovereignty over itself. $veNATION holders will still govern it.\n- North Star metric changes towards *GDP of the network state*.\n\n## North Star metrics alignment\n\nTo increase the GDP of a network state, first we need to create a network state.\n\nTo do so, this proposal aims to onboard tons of sovereign individuals (high mobility, high wealth) into a platform helping them move to where they are best treated. Then we aim to flag their economic interest in setting up Special Economic Zones to governments, eventually reaching deals with them. After that, sovereign individuals can move and kickstart economic activity within the network state, further increasing its GDP.\n\nPR at https://github.com/nation3/gov-proposals/pull/69/files",

An MVP for a semi-official package manager runs on a centralized server run by the Nation3 Solar Guild, and there are no integrity checks such as hash verification or signature verification to ensure that the document/package is legitimately by that author and not redefining certain terms retroactively to the detriment of agreement users.\n\nThis document registry would be an improvement to the current system by having the content of these documents be located through IPFS and with some metadata on-chain.\n\nThe features of this document registry (and associated interface) are:\n\n- Immutable revisions\n- On-chain metadata\n- Actual data stored on IPFS\n- Transferable zone NFTs\n\nPR at https://github.com/nation3/gov-proposals/pull/67",

      "title": "N3GOV-45: Ratify Dispute Resolution Process V1",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal, as a first version, aims to amend [Nation3's current Dispute Resolution Process](https://github.com/nation3/law/blob/main/contracts/DisputeResolutionProcess.linked.md). The amendments provide more flexibility in communication methods, introduce an appeal process for procedural issues, and create a more streamlined dispute resolution experience. We acknowledge that there is still room for improvement, particularly in the appeal process, but wish to move forward with these amendments to provide a better experience for users.\n\n## Background\nNation3's current Dispute Resolution Process follows a structured timeline and relies on Skiff Ethereum aliases for communication. In response to feedback from our community and judges, this proposal seeks to address the limitations of the current process.\n\n## Goals\n- Enhance flexibility in communication methods for dispute resolution.\n- Introduce an initial version of an appeal process for procedural issues.\n- Streamline the dispute resolution process for a more efficient and transparent experience\n- Continuously improve the dispute resolution process based on user feedback and evolving needs\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nImplement the [new Dispute Resolution Process V1](https://bafybeifiehkdnx5yhyrengoim5dhjclhxba6yhske6rwbm7dcv527gk524.ipfs.w3s.link/DisputeResolutionProcess.linked.md) outlined in the provided text, which includes amendments to the communication mechanism, evidence submission process, privacy rules, platform malfunction provisions, language requirements, and the introduction of an appeal process. We recognize that the appeal process may require further refinement and are committed to continuously improving it in future iterations based on user feedback.\n\n### Key Amendments\n1. Extension for Time Windows: Introducing the option for parties to extend the Evidence Submission Time Window and Outcome Proposal Time Window, with a combined duration not exceeding 21 days.\n2. Enhanced Communication Mechanism: Allowing parties to agree on alternative means for communication and evidence submissions, such as email, Discord, or Telegram.\n3. Streamlined Evidence Submission Process: Simplifying the process for parties to submit evidence by either specifying their preferred communication method or using an Skiff Ethereum alias.\n4. Appeal Process for Procedural Issues: Introducing an appeal process limited to procedural issues, such as deadlines not being respected, improper notifications, or biased judges, with the DAO deciding whether the appeal proceeds.\n\n## Alignment with North Star Metric\nBy creating a more flexible and transparent dispute resolution process, we will be able to attract more users to Nation3's legal system, thus increasing the Total Value Secured within the platform. This V1 proposal acknowledges that further improvements may be needed and is committed to an ongoing process of refinement based on user feedback and evolving needs.",

      "title": "N3GOV-44: Withdraw ANT from vesting contract + LP it in a Uniswap ANT:NATION pool",
      "content": "### Summary\nThis proposal is to withdraw ANT tokens from the [vesting contract ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5CB5Ba62DC8ced477f20d4692986f1Cd42174761)and provide liquidity in the Uniswap ANT:NATION pool. This proposal aims to increase the liquidity of NATION & ANT tokens, and providing additional benefits for both communities. \n\n### Background\nAs a DAO, it is important for Nation3 to maintain a healthy liquidity pool for its token, NATION, and also ensure the availability of other tokens which are relevant to its ecosystem. Apart from this, the DAO could also generate income from being a Liquidity Provider, instead of having Aragon's tokens sitting idle in a contract. It's also important to mention that creating an LP between Aragon and Nation3 helps align our incentives as communities by providing liquidity, since this facilitates conversion between ANT and NATION.\n\n### Goals\n**The goals of this proposal are:**\n\n* To increase liquidity for NATION and ANT\n* Receive fees from LP\n\n\n### Proposed Solution\nWe propose withdrawing 20,000 ANT tokens (the amount that would be available at the time this proposal would be approved) from the vesting contract and LPing them in the Uniswap ANT:NATION pool, this would require matching that amount in NATION tokens, which at current valuation, would sit around ~ NATION.\n\n### Financials\n* The current value of the 20,000 ANT tokens is approximately $60,000. \n* This means that at current value of ~$[420](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/nation3), we would need around 145 NATION, if we decide to use all the ANT tokens.\n\n### Risks\nHowever, there are some risks to consider:\n\n* Impermanent loss: LP providers may experience impermanent loss if the value of ANT and NATION tokens diverges significantly.\n* Smart Contract risks: Even though Uniswap is probably the most reliable DEX, there might be some risks involved with smart contracts which could affect our position.\n\n### Alignment with North Star Metric\nThis proposal is aligned with our North Star Metric, which is, [to increase the Total Value Secured within Nation3's legal system](https://snapshot.org/#/nation3.eth/proposal/0x029fa9d97d350d77d1ce1738bf3663138ed55a692d264f6f81c2a1d2609716c3), since it increases the liquidity of our own token, making it more accessible for others and also allowing us to accrue trading fees in the meantime which could go towards furthering our cause.\n\n",

      "title": " N3GOV-43: Funding Proposal: Community Coordinator Q2 2023- Q3 2023 ",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal outlines the need to increase the monthly budget for the community coordinator from “0.33 $NATION per month” to “1 $NATION per month” and to continue payment for six months. The reason for this increase is due to the market fluctuation that occurred last year, causing the value of 1 $NATION to decrease from 4000USD to 750USD.\n\nAdditionally, the data from the citizen directory showed that the community coordinator has worked for a total of 333.72 hours from June 5, 2022 to March 5, 2023, averaging 8.343 hours per week and 33.37 hours per month, with the longest total hours worked in December 2022 at 59.35 hours.\n\nFurthermore, it should be taken into account that the community coordinator may need to work on weekends to help and respond to community member needs.\n\n*Given the differences in the size and level of engagement among various communities, the workload of community coordinators may vary. Therefore, this proposal only pertains to the community coordinator of the Chinese community. \n\n## Background\nIn a community-driven organization, the role of a community coordinator is crucial. The community coordinator serves as a bridge between the organization and its members. They need to communicate the progress and updates of the project to the community members in a timely manner, as well as address and resolve any questions or concerns that the members may have. The community coordinator is also responsible for helping new members integrate into the community and ensuring that they feel welcomed and supported.\n\nCommunity coordinators play a vital role in fostering a positive and inclusive community environment. They are often the first point of contact for community members, and their dedication and commitment to the community are essential for its growth and success. A community coordinator’s contributions are instrumental in building a sense of community and fostering a strong sense of belonging among its members. \n## Problem Statement\nThe current monthly budget of 0.33 $NATION per month for the community coordinator is insufficient and does not reflect the amount of time and effort they contribute to the community. The market fluctuation and decrease in NATION value, combined with the community coordinator’s workload, make it necessary to increase the monthly budget to 1 $NATION per month.\n\n## Proposal\nThe proposal is to increase the monthly budget for the community coordinator from 0.33 $NATION to 1 $NATION per month and continue payment for six months. This increase will better reflect the amount of time and effort the community coordinator contributes to the community and ensure that they are appropriately compensated for their work. It is also proposed to take into account the community coordinator’s potential need to work on weekends to support community member needs.\n\nThe six-month payment period is proposed to avoid budgetary issues arising from potential $NATION price changes.\n\n## Budget\n1 $NATION per month per Community Coordinator for six months, resulting in a total budget of 6 $NATION.\nThe budget will be paid in $NATION currency. \n\n## Duration\nApril 1, 2023 (Singapore) →  October 1, 2023 (Singapore) \n\n## Participant\nChinese Community: @rencai201 ",

However, to make disputable streams happen we need to build them — therefore needing some funds upfront.\n\nThis is the breakdown:\n\n- 350k USDC: To be sent upfront.\n- 400k USDC: To be set on a disputable stream lasting 6 months and starting 3 months from the enactment of this proposal.\n- 405 NATION: For contributor vesting packages, [as already approved in the first proposal](https://forum.nation3.org/t/formation-of-the-solar-guild-roadmap-proposal/803). To be sent upfront.\n- 270.04 NATION: For contributor vesting packages, to be set on a disputable stream lasting 6 months and starting 3 months from the enactment of this proposal.\n- 500 NATION: To perform internal treasury diversification to cover the rest of the total amount. To be sent upfront.\n\n## Team\n\nThe Solar Guild is now composed of five full-time contributors. [Read more about them here](https://www.notion.so/Join-Solar-Guild-030e549ec558493c94ae3b8496e4e7bc).\n\nWe also have an additional part-time contributor doing full stack development.\n\nSolar Guild aims to hire two more full-time members for the following roles:\n\n- Ecosystem and growth.\n- Solidity/full-stack.\n\nSolar Guild members will opt-out of any other compensation from open & operational guilds.\n\n## Skin in the game\n\nThe leading contributors within Solar Guild, @luis, @0xGallego and @anastasiya will enter a Nation3 agreement with the Nation3 DAO, putting 180 NATION as collateral. Even if disputable streams aren’t implemented yet, this is a sign of goodwill and accountability toward the Nation3 DAO.\n\nPR at https://github.com/nation3/gov-proposals/pull/53/files",

      "content": "This would be a governance proposal to modify the North Star metrics to:\n\n* Total Value Secured (TVS) within Nation3's legal system: Net value of all tokens that have been used/are currently used as collateral for a Nation3 agreement, expressed as BTC.\n\nAnd the goal for Q2 2023:\n* TVS >50 BTC. That's 3x from today's value. \n\n## Rationale\nProduct-market fit for Nation3 agreements are Nation3's bet on sovereignty and sustainability. To build a nation we will need to be sovereign and self-sustainable. Nation3 agreements achieving strong product-market it enables both.\n\n## Discussion\nIn this proposal, I intentionally left out [number of active citizens](https://forum.nation3.org/t/proposal-set-nation3s-north-star-metrics/732) for the moment. The main reason is lack of compelling proposals to organically increase such number. Although there's been progress to track that number ([with the Citizen Directory](https://forum.nation3.org/t/project-funding-proposal-complete-the-development-of-a-citizen-directory/885)), I don't think that just automating SourceCred sign ups will lead to a great surge in citizen activity.\n\nInstead, maybe building something worth governing (the jurisdiction) will naturally lead to more active citizens. I had the same experience at Aragon pushing DAOs: no one cared about DAOs until DeFi, where protocols suddenly controlled billions of $ and therefore governing them became valuable.\n\nSo maybe achieving PMF comes before trying to optimize for citizen activity.\n\nPR at https://github.com/nation3/gov-proposals/pull/43/files and https://github.com/nation3/law/pull/3/files",

      "title": "N3GOV-34: Nation3 <> Aragon partnership & token swap ",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal would establish a partnership between [Aragon](https://aragon.org) and Nation3, as a cornerstone to make DeLaw happen and superpower DAOs.\n\nThere is already significant ideological alignment and team alignment, and this proposal would take this a step forward by formalizing financial alignment as well. This proposal would also enable Aragon to superpower its offering to DAOs and DAO contributors with legally-binding agreements, while being able to remain laser-focused on DAO tooling and the DAO framework offerings. This proposal would also help the Nation3 Jurisdiction achieve product-market fit through streamlined distribution to the world's top DAOs.\n\n# Details\n\n## Introduction\n\nWhen I co-founded Aragon back in 2016, we had a vision to make on-chain organizations happen. We realized the potential of creating new kinds of entities that would be fully sovereign, highly efficient, and transparent (when needed).\n\nAs we realized over the years, we were too early. Many building blocks needed to be built. When we released Aragon to the public, Dai wasn’t even launched.\n\nToday, DeFi allows DAOs to have access to even better tools for yield and treasury management than those of traditional corporations.\n\nThe second building block that we had envisioned for Aragon was a decentralized jurisdiction (think of it as DeLaw). After all, DAOs can run some operations on dry code (smart contracts), but a lot of the human interactions cannot be codified, and must run on wet code (legal contracts).\n\nFor that purpose we envisioned Aragon Court — a first-of-its-kind dispute resolution protocol.\n\nWe imagined that DAOs could leverage all the best of automation with smart contracts, while also enjoying the granularity of legal contracts collateralized by tokens. And, in the process, we thought we would build the world’s first digital jurisdiction where DAOs are first-class citizens.\n\nUnfortunately, Aragon Court failed. Looking back, its failure was mainly attributed to four things:\n\n- First and foremost, building core infrastructure for DAOs is a huge undertaking by itself. We were stretched too thin and couldn’t focus on Aragon Court. Which I think was the right call — *focusing on everything means focusing on nothing*.\n- Second, dispute resolution cannot exist on its own without a system of law. Whoever is in charge of resolving disputes needs a clear framework to adhere to.\n- Third, no one wanted to rely on an anonymous jury (random people over the Internet staking tokens) to resolve their disputes. Everyone wanted legal professionals instead. Understandably so.\n- Fourth, making all agreeements and disputes public (even having to make sensitive evidence public) turned off potential users. No organization wants to make their disagreements public, and of course there’s a big privacy concern for individuals too.\n\nUltimately, I think there’s some potential in Aragon Court or Kleros-style dispute resolution protocols in the area of content moderation for public communities. After all, content moderation doesn’t require the intricacy of contractual law, and also content is public by default.\n\nBut when it comes to giving DAOs tools to create better agreements with each other or their contributors, a different set of tradeoffs was needed. We realized that a composable dispute resolution system with predictable guidelines and constraints (laws) and where participants can keep their privacy, was needed to onboard the next 10k DAOs.\n\n## Enter Nation3\n\nAs you all know, after kickstarting a vibrant community of Sovereign Individuals around Nation3, we asked ourselves: what’s the most fundamental service a cloud nation can provide?\n\nEventually we realized it is a system of law, which then enables a healthy economy and market environment to exist, in turn giving birth to more products and services that citizens can benefit from. Following that logic, we [started working on Nation3 Court](https://forum.nation3.org/t/nation3-court-a-backbone-to-bootstrap-a-circular-economy-by-increasing-trust-between-citizens/553).\n\nNow we are about to launch the Nation3 jurisdiction, including a [fully functioning court system](https://github.com/nation3/jurisdiction), [a constitution](https://linked.md/v?u=https://linked.md/api/github/nation3/law/main/Constitution.linked.md) and [other checks and balances](https://docs.nation3.org/jurisdiction/overview).\n\nNation3 will allow anyone, for the very first time, to enter legally-binding agreements over the Internet, with no need to ultimately rely on a traditional jurisdiction.\n\n## Nation3 <> Aragon integration\n\nThese are some of the opportunities that Nation3 can bring to Aragon:\n\n- **Disputable voting**: This was envisioned by Jorge and I and [partly implemented by the Aragon One team](https://blog.aragon.org/technical-details-of-the-aragon-network/). DAO token holders can deposit collateral and make a proposal to undergo a vote, but if such proposal contradicts the DAO’s charter, anyone can dispute it. This means only actions that align with the DAO’s charter and the law can pass — closing off countless attack vectors for DAOs.\n- **Disputable streams**: Imagine disputable Sablier/Superfluid streams. For example, enabling DAOs to enter an agreement with each guild, and then have their ops guild being able to oversee the work of a guild and pause the stream if needed. Any of the parties can open a dispute if they feel the agreement has been breached. This is unprecedented. Right now the status quo gives almost unparalleled power to the DAO (if payments are after work is delivered) or to the recipient (if payments are upfront, before work is delivered). This obviously hurts trust, in turn hurting efficiency and stability. Nation3 provides credibly neutral streams in which every party is equal before the law, once and for all removing the cat and mouse game of payment flow.\n- **Trustless** **Aragon DAO**: The current design of the Aragon DAO involves a trusted group of people that can veto changes over the Guardians, which are entrusted with the duty of ensuring that proposals adhere to the DAO’s charter. Unfortunately, this poses a centralization risk and a burden for the people in those positions. Using Nation3 would eliminate both. The DAO’s charter could define actions that are illegal, such as funding or undertaking any criminal activities, or paying out dividends. It would offer a higher level of legal certainty to all DAO participants.\n- **Eventual legal recognition for DAOs in SEZ**: Nation3 is cloud-first, land-last. Nation3 aims to prove that it can run an Internet-native jurisdiction and a system of law first, and then negotiate the creation of Special Economic Zones in traditional jurisdictions. Traditional jurisdictions, which aren’t Web3-native, need to resort to violence and coercion to enforce legal rulings over cryptoassets. On the other hand, Nation3 is a Web3-native jurisdiction where cryptoassets and DAOs are the default, and rulings over them are enforceable on-chain.\n\nAnd that Aragon can bring to Nation3:\n- **Distribution to the world's top DAOs**: Internet-native legally binding agreements are a powerful tool for DAOs and contributors. Aragon is one of the best position players to help Nation3 target both.\n- **TVL within the Nation3 Jurisdiction**: If Aragon wished to use Nation3 to secure its switch to a completely trustless DAO, it would significantly increase the TVL of the jurisdiction, and serve as a great case study. Aragon holds >$150m in its treasury (and that's in the midst of a bear market).\n- **Powerful DAO infrastructure**: Nation3 couldn't exist without Aragon. The level of granularity achieved with aragonOS enables DAOs to experiment with governance at the speed of software. Aragon can keep bringing and maintaining such infrastructure to light, and Nation3 will leverage it.\n\n# Financials\n\nTo formalize this partnership, the following token swaps would happen:\n\n- 1k NATION for 300k ANT.\n- 1k NATION for 1m USDC/DAI.\n\nAll NATION and ANT will be subject to 1-year linear vesting.\n\nFor Nation3, 2k NATION represents ~5% of the total supply. For Aragon, 300k ANT represents ~0.69% of the total supply, and $1m represents ~0.5% of the treasury.\n\nAragon gets a unique chance to seed the world’s first Internet-native jurisdiction, and Nation3 gets a unique chance to achieve distribution to the world’s top DAOs.\n\n# Risks\n\n- External factors (like a regulatory crackdown taking the industry unprepared) might decrease DAO usage, slowing down the adoption of Nation3 agreeements. The Nation3 jurisdiction really flourishes with Web3-native use cases.\n- Tokens can be volatile in their value and both sides might face economic losses.\n- Smart contract bugs in aragonOS (both used by Aragon DAO and Nation3 DAO) can result in economic loses.\n\n---\n\nPR at https://github.com/nation3/gov-proposals/pull/42/files",

      "title": "N3GOV-27: Formation of the Solar Guild & Roadmap Proposal",
      "content": "This is the suggested roadmap for the Solar Guild, a guild composed of a handful of laser-focused full-time members.\n\n## Intro\n\n**Why**: All the other guilds are semi-open and mostly composed of part-time members. That structure works very well in some cases like maintainance of existing products, adding scoped features and performing research. However, [two-pizza teams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-devops-aws/two-pizza-teams.html) with full-time members excel in efficient product prototyping, fast-paced iterations and tight vertical integrations. Nation3 has the opportunity to leverage both models and their respective tradeoffs. The Solar Guild would leverage the latter to efficiently bring to market new products like the Court or the next iteration of Passports. For further background, check [the original proposal for re-org](https://forum.nation3.org/t/proposal-for-internal-re-organisation/730/5).\n\n**Who**: @anastasiya @0xGallego @luis  to start with, + new hires\n\n**What**: Solar Guild LLC is a limited liability company established in Delaware, in order to provide certain legal protection to its contractors.\n\n## Roadmap\nSee the [Forum discussion](https://forum.nation3.org/t/formation-of-the-solar-guild-roadmap-proposal/803)\n\n## Financials\n\nSolar Guild requests 370k USDC as its funding for 6 months, which includes compensation of members, core infrastructure services, and in-person team building. \n\n*This vote is for a portion of the funding, 92,500 USDC. The rest of the requested funding will be subject to another vote in the future.*\n\nSolar Guild also requests 405 NATION for long-term alignment, in order to offer vesting plans with 1-year cliff and 4-year vesting to guild members. To clarify, Solar Guild will only receive such NATION to set up vesting streams after reasonably delivering on the OKRs described in this proposal, and a successful subsequent  proposal for another 6 months of funding (therefore meeting the 1 year cliff). 405 NATION is therefore equivalent to the 1st year of vesting.\n\nSolar Guild will hire full-time members for the following roles:\n\n- Comms & community to handle social media, PR & media relations, and contribute to content production, event coordination, and community growth\n- Frontend developer to take the lead the development & improvement of the new apps and component libraries.\n- Solidity / full-stack developer to increase the workload capacity of the team in regard to smart-contracts and other required backend services development.\n\nShould Solar Guild not hire for some of those positions, it shall return any USDC and NATION corresponding to those hires to the Nation3 DAO.\n\nSolar Guild members will opt-out of any other compensation from open guilds.\n\n## Key considerations\n\n- Solar Guild is a guild within Nation3. Its sole purpose is to advance the Nation3 mission.\n- Solar Guild doesn’t aim to expand past a two-pizza team (which is important to keep a philosophy of substraction).\n- Solar Guild will follow a philosophy of subtraction and always prioritize Nation3’s interests above their own.\n\nSee the Github proposal: https://github.com/nation3/gov-proposals/blob/main/proposals/N3GOV-27.json",

      "title": "N3GOV-24: Re-finance to cover the approaching repayment of $50k bond",
      "content": "## Background\n\nOn August 2nd, @Luis [made a proposal](https://forum.nation3.org/t/proposal-issue-over-collateralized-bond-to-raise-50-000-usdc/725) to raise a $50k bond to fund work on approved  community proposals denominated in USDC. The proposal was approved and [resulted in a successful bond issuance](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/loan/1021). The term of the bond was 90 days, and its maturity date is approaching in 15 days (on 07/12/2022). The bond was collateralised with 150 $NATION. \n\nThe bond was raised with a reasoning that the market conditions were not optimal for the DAO to sell $NATION, and that it was sensible that such sale of $NATION \"should be postponed until a further price and liquidity increase.\". \n\nI'd argue that the reasoning still holds true today, as, expectedly, the market conditions have not yet improved in such short term. \n\n## Proposal\n\nI propose to raise another bond, to enable the DAO to refinance and repay the debt within the required timeframe, avoiding therefore the unfavourable sale of 150 $NATION (the collateral that would be kept by the lender in the case of failure to repay the loan).\n\nNew bond terms: \n\n* Amount to raise: 52.2k USDC\n* Maturity date: 90 days to 360 days (targeting the longest possible)\n* Collateral: up to 390 $NATION allowance, to account for price fluctuations and allow for collateralisation of up to 300% (targeting the least amount of $NATION)\n* Platform: [PWN ](https://app.pwn.xyz/) \n\nTo clarify, the Meta Guild would attempt to use the least amount of $NATION possible (up to the approved allowance) for the longest possible term (no less than 90 days, no more than 360 days), in order to ensure the bond offer is successful.\n\nIn PWN, once the offer to sell the bond is posted, buyers can publish their counter-offers stating their desired interest rate.\n\nAs previously, the Meta Guild multisig will be responsible for receiving the collateral, creating the offer in PWN and accepting the best counter-offer. The best counter-offer shall be the one with the lowest interest rate that can cover the desired amount, proposed during the first 3 days after the bond is posted.\n\nAfter the USDC is received by the Meta Guild multisig, it will use the funds to pay back the [outstanding debt.](https://app.pwn.xyz/#/loan/1021) \n\nOnce the bond approaches maturity, another governance proposal will need to be made to decide if the market conditions are favourable to settle it through the sale of $NATION, or through raising another bond.\n\n## North Star Metrics\n\nThe refinancing is required for optimal treasury management, allowing the DAO to retain $NATION instead of selling at unfavourable rates, and therefore have more of the treasury available to fund the work towards having more active citizens & more value secured by the Nation3 jurisdiction.\n\nThis is the [pull request](https://github.com/nation3/gov-proposals/blob/main/proposals/N3GOV-24.json) on the governance repo with the actual proposal.",

      "content": "### Background\n\nA proposal 5 has been made to establish the Solar Guild - a “two-pizza team” comprised of full-time members exclusively focused on advancing the Nation3 mission. Specifically, according to the recently published roadmap, the Guild would focus on:\n\n- efficiently bringing to market new products like the Court;\n- issuing the next iteration of Passports;\n- drafting the Nation3 Constitution;\n- establishing the Guardian Guild;\n- integrating all Nation3 apps into one monorepo;\n- maintaining key infrastructure services for Nation3;\n- driving brand recognition & community building.\n\n### Proposal\n\nSell a bond to raise the USDC necessary to fund the Solar Guild for the next 6 months, with the following terms:\n\n- Amount to raise: 370,000 USDC\n- Maturity date: 360 days\n- Collateral: 1300 $NATION (roughly 250% collateralization ratio)\n- Platform: [PWN ](https://app.pwn.xyz/)\n\nIn PWN, once the offer to sell the bond is posted, buyers can publish their counter-offers stating their desired interest rate.\n\nThe Meta Guild multisig will be responsible for receiving the collateral, creating the offer in PWN and accepting the best counter-offer. The best counter-offer shall be the one with the lowest interest rate that can cover the desired amount, proposed during the first week after the bond is posted.\n\nOnce the Meta Guild has received the USDC, it will hold it while the Solar Guild proposal goes through formal governance vote. If the Solar Guild proposal passes the vote, the Meta Guild will send the funds to the Solar Guild multisig.\n\nOnce the DAO has USDC to pay back the bond, a new governance proposal will be needed for the DAO to send funds to the Meta Guild multisig, for the amount to be paid back.\n\n### The North Star Metrics\n\nThe proposal directly affects our North Star metrics, as it effectively dedicates a full time guild towards their achievement. The Solar Guild OKRs specified above aim to increase the total value secured by the Nation3 jurisdiction - e.g. bringing to market the Nation3 Court and introducing more checks and balances through the Nation3 Constitution and the Guardian Guild.\n\nThe issuance of more Passport types, as well as community building and increase in brand recognition will increase the citizen base, and with it, the number of active citizens.\n\nThis is the [pull request](https://github.com/nation3/gov-proposals/blob/main/proposals/N3GOV-22.json) on the governance repo with the actual proposal.",

Measuring in USD makes us prone to market externalities, while measuring in NATION creates a perverse incentive for the value of the token not to grow so it’s easier to reach the goal\n\nFor Q4 2022, let’s have a discussion about the particular numbers we should target. Just to get the ball rolling, let’s say:\n- **50 active citizens**: Trying to target a NationCred score equivalent to a citizen devoting 1h/week to Nation3\n- **1 BTC**: In my opinion this is more of a symbolic figure, since the important milestone will be to launch the court (plus everything required like recruiting jurors, drafting meta-agreements…) and heavily test it, not to pursue growth yet\n\nAfter having set this metrics, then guilds can start working on initiatives to increase them, thus creating sub-objectives with their own KPIs.\n\n[Check out the PR on the gov proposals repo](https://github.com/nation3/gov-proposals/pull/18).",

      "content": "A [North Star metric](https://mixpanel.com/blog/north-star-metric/) is paramount since it aligns everyone in the nation towards a particular, measurable goal.\n\nEverything we do should then be aligned with such metric. While we already have the [Nation3 Manifesto](https://nation3.org/manifesto) establishing the vision and the moral compass, a manifesto isn't measurable per se.\n\nThis proposal aims for Nation3 to adopt the following North Star metrics:\n\n-   **Number of active citizens**: The ethos of the Nation3 Manifesto is that we need to re-imagine nation states so people can enjoy increased freedom, wealth and fairness. In order to deliver on such vision, we need to onboard as citizens the people who need Nation3 the most. But at this early stage we need to prioritize citizens who can be valuable stakeholders in building Nation3. Active citizens can be defined as having a minimum NationCred score over a period of time. More citizens means more locked $NATION, thus providing further funding to the Nation3 DAO.\n-   **Total value secured by the Nation3 jurisdiction**: An emergent way to frame Nation3's first core service (apart from citizenship itself) is as [a system of law](https://forum.nation3.org/t/nation3-court-a-backbone-to-bootstrap-a-circular-economy-by-increasing-trust-between-citizens/553)/decentralized jurisdiction. As we make the Nation3 jurisdiction enticing for individuals and other entities to securely conduct business transactions, we are creating a cloud nation with a strong internal economy and also providing extra reasons for people to become citizens. The collateral for agreements secured by the Nation3 jurisdiction is $NATION, so this also helps fund the Nation3 DAO.\n\nAlthough these North Star metrics can be amended in future proposals, it's extremely important to start off with the right alignment.\n\nThis is the [pull request on the governance repo](https://github.com/nation3/gov-proposals/pull/9) with the actual proclamation statement as follows:\n\n> Nation3 should adopt the following North Star metrics: 1) Number of active citizens, and 2) Total value secured by the Nation3 jurisdiction. Everything the Nation3 DAO does should be aligned with increasing such metrics.",

Even more so knowing that GSR became the official $NATION market maker and might start work on increasing market liquidity soon. In other words, it would seem that the DAO selling $NATION should be postponed until a further price and liquidity increase.\n\nBut in the meantime, there are multiple proposals that have passed and are denominated in USDC. Those commitments currently amount to 90k USDC over the next few months.\n\n## Proposal\n\nSell a bond with the following terms:\n- Amount to raise: 50k USDC\n- Maturity date: 90 days\n- Collateral: 150 $NATION (roughly 300% collateralization ratio)\n- Platform: [PWN](https://app.pwn.xyz/)\n\nIn PWN, once the offer to sell the bond is posted, buyers can publish their counter-offers stating their desired interest rate.\n\nThe Meta Guild multisig will be responsible of receiving the collateral, creating the offer in PWN and accepting the best counter-offer. The best counter-offer shall be the one with the lowest interest rate that can cover the desired amount, proposed during the first 48h after the bond is posted.\n\nAfter the USDC is received by the Meta Guild multisig, it will send the funds back to the DAO. Once the DAO has USDC to pay back the bond, a new governance proposal will be needed for the DAO to send funds to the Meta Guild multisig, for the amount to be paid back. \n\n## Actionable proposal\n\n```\n{\n  \"spec\": 1,\n  \"discussion\": \"https://forum.nation3.org/t/proposal-issue-over-collateralized-bond-to-raise-50-000-usdc/725\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"kind\": \"custodial-treasury-management\",\n    \"transfers\": [\n      {\n        \"chainId\": 1,\n        \"from\": \"0x336252602b3a8a0be336ed942228305173e8082b\",\n        \"recipient\": \"0x7fFf737ae9FdDD6E28Fe8B8F0F4dE69Bb8e7a885\",\n        \"token\": \"0x333A4823466879eeF910A04D473505da62142069\",\n        \"amount\": 150\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```",

      "title": "N3GOV-13: Formalize Nation3 governance process ",
      "content": "When I cofounded Aragon in 2016, we thought that DAOs would be managed under one tool supporting the end-to-end lifecycle of governance. We got lots of assumptions right, but that clearly wasn’t one of them!\n\nToday, DAOs are managed by using a bunch of tools, from off-chain discussions in forums to signaling tools like Snapshot and then on-chain enactment with Aragon.\n\nWith such wide range of tools, the actual content of the proposals and how they affect the DAO’s assets and resources can get lost in context or misinterpreted.\n\nFor example, from the recent governance proposals involving financial transactions, **none had Ethereum addresses where to send funds**. Some of them concerning payments also **didn’t specify how or when to conduct payouts** (e.g. upfront, monthly, weekly). As a result, there are tons of work involved to just lay out details on a proposal post-vote. That is quite dangerous, as it means that proposals are being passed without fully understanding what they do/will do.\n\nThis is normal, since there is a mismatch between plain English (pay X person for a project) vs on-chain code (call `method(params)` in `0x123...321`). The way that the traditional world deals with this is to have very specific language, legal language, and outlining all of the terms in the most precise way. That takes tons of time and I don't think we want to hire an army of lawyers to deal with our own governance. There's another simpler way: **use data structures, type checking and smart contracts**.\n\nI have been working on a standard for DAO governance that outlines the data structures needed for a DAO to operate. I have also incorporated a governance process defining step-by-step how to make governance proposals.\n\nThis work builds upon my learnings from Aragon. The first governance process we had, [AGP-1](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/02038b15dedaf93516e2deff34ce72e6cf276679/AGPs/AGP-1.md) was quite an elegant process, but we faced significant issues since proposals were just written in plain English, and **we had to deal with the lack of encoded/deterministic output after each proposal**. The main learning I took from that process is that a DAO governance process needs a clear spec of what a proposal actually does, and **you should be able to write the actual proposal in plain JSON**.\n\nOf course a more understandable description in English is needed for the proposer to explain themselves, but having an encoded version is paramount to ensure we don't fall into chaos or unwanted side effects.\n\nMy proposal for Nation3's governance process is defined in [GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/nation3/governance/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md), together with the data structures defined in [N3GOV-v1.d.ts](https://github.com/nation3/gov/blob/main/specs/N3GOV-v1.d.ts).\n\nIn total the human-readable process **fits within 90 lines of text** and the data structures within 300 lines of code (most of which are comments). I've been trying to simplify as much as possible, since I have also seen how overly **complex processes make things worse and become a playing field for bureaucrats to thrive, instead of builders**.\n\nI added some color on [a few design decisions](https://github.com/nation3/gov/blob/main/DESIGN.md) that I took along the way, to provide strong guarantees around our governance process.\n\nAs an up-and-coming digital jurisdiction, providing a reliable framework of law should be at the center of Nation3’s value prop. To keep such reliability, our own governance process is paramount.\n\nI'd love to hear feedback from the Nation3 community, and have a discussion about such an important topic for our nation!\n\nPS: I have retrofitted, as well as possible, all our existing Snapshot proposals to follow this spec [here](https://github.com/nation3/gov-proposals/blob/main/proposals/).\n\nThis is the actual proposal adhering to this very spec:\n```\n{\n  \"spec\": 1,\n  \"id\": 13,\n  \"discussion\": \"https://forum.nation3.org/t/proposal-formalize-nation3-governance-process/712\",\n  \"content\": {\n    \"kind\": \"proclamation\",\n    \"statement\": \"The following governance process is to be followed now for all Nation3 DAO governance proposals: https://github.com/nation3/gov/blob/92687c33f8bce37dda9e62882b39720eb1b28df3/GOVERNANCE.md\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"choices\": [\n        \"Approve\",\n        \"Reject\"\n      ],\n      \"votingSystem\": \"single-choice\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

      "content": "Original rational by @luis : https://forum.nation3.org/t/nation3-court-a-backbone-to-bootstrap-a-circular-economy-by-increasing-trust-between-citizens/553\n\n## Goals & Scope\n\nThe goal of the Nation3 Court project it's to provide a system that allows the creation of collateral agreements between two or more non-trusted parties that will be arbitrated by a trusted third party in the case of a dispute.\n\nThis project's scope is to research, design & develop the set of tools required to bootstrap an initial version of this system. At the end of this project, we expect to have:\n- A Solidity framework to create & manage arbitrated agreements.\n- The tools required to set up and operate a court of jurors to arbitrate those agreements.\n- An initial human-friendly UI to create & manage agreements, as well as to resolve disputes.\n\n## Expected Deliverables\n\n- Agreement framework contract.\n- Modules to operate the court as a modified multi-sig. Probably based on Zodiac architecture.\n- Subgraph to retrieve agreement information. Including the setup of an indexer Graph node.\n- UI for agreements users.\n- UI for jurors operations.\n- Docs on the system architecture and usage.\n- Support integrating the system with Nation3 setup.\n\n## Team\n\nCoordinator: @0xGallego\n\nEstimated to have a 2-5 size team composed of:\n- 1-2 Smart contract developers*\n- 1-2 Frontend developers*\n- 1 UX / UI designer\n\n*(Full-stack developers could fill the gaps also)\n\n## Budget request\n\nThe budget requested will account for:\n\n- Compensation for a team of 2-4 developers + 1 designer. (>85%)\n- Bounties for outsourced work. (<10%)\n- Deployment & setup costs. (<5%)\n- Team operational costs.\n\nIt won't account for audit costs.\n\nI propose a budget allocation of 60K USD valuation for the whole project.\nIn the case of USDC available in the treasury, I suggest a split of 40K USDC / 20K (USD) in NATION (Valuation at payment). In other case, the team will negotiate with the Meta Guild on the best outcome for both parties.\n\n## Timeline estimation\n\nIt will depend on the number of contributors to join and the final team capacity.\nI would expect 1 month of work in an ideal scenario that could extend to 2 months with fewer resources.\n\n## KPI - Rewards plan\n\nThe Meta Guild will be responsible to validate the progress of the project and perform the payments to the team. The budget for the project should be allocated to the Finance & Ops multisig before payments.\n\n**25% - Published refined specs for both Contracts & UI**\n**50% - Demo version working in testnet**\n**100% - Completed version deployed in Mainnet**\n\nWith each the achieve of each KPI the team will be able to claim the % of the budget matching the progress.",

      "title": "GSR Market Making Proposal",
      "content": "### GSR Market Making Proposal <> Nation3(NATION)\n\nThis proposal outlines the indicative terms of an agreement for market-making services (the “Agreement”) to be provided by GSR Markets Limited (“GSR”) for the NATION token, and provides relevant background on GSR. The aim of this proposal is to seek approval for a loan of 2,104 NATION tokens, which would be used by GSR to provide liquidity across a set of specifically-supported venues.\n\n### GSR: Who are we?\n\nFounded in 2013, GSR is a crypto market-maker that utilizes its proprietary trading system, often trading $3 - $5bn a day of volume across the entire crypto ecosystem. Composed of nearly 300 individuals, with a core engineering and trading focus, GSR uses nearly a decade of market data and expertise to continuously refine and expand its trading engines and programmatic execution capabilities, with a focus on providing best-in-class service to our clients across different stages of their development. With connectivity across 60+ crypto exchanges, GSR is also integrated with various major decentralized exchanges (DEX’s) and lending protocols.\n\nGSR partners with projects across the entire crypto ecosystem, and has considerable expertise across the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. GSR has provided, at times, over US$1bn of liquidity a day to DeFi markets. GSR has invested in excess of $50m in DeFi protocols in the Web3 ecosystem, with the intention of further expanding its investments in the second half 2022.\n\n### Nation3 and GSR: How can we add Value to Nation3’s community?\n\nAfter engaging with some of the prominent partners of the Nation3 movement, and observing the evolution of its governance, which echoes the ideals of a true Web3 crypto-powered community, we believe GSR is uniquely positioned to provide liquidity for the NATION token across various centralized exchanges (many of whom require a dedicated market-maker).\n\nNation3’s ability to leverage the Web3 ecosystem in transforming the concept of nation-states to crypto-powered communities is a testament to its unique ethos. As the Nation3 community evolves beyond its current size, it is essential for it to gain exposure across a broader set of market participants. Being listed across centralized exchanges (CEX’s) should allow the NATION token to penetrate a larger and more diverse audience and facilitate its further adoption across retail and institutional investors who seek trading opportunities. As a market-maker, GSR aims to facilitate frictionless price discovery and, while doing so, GSR will serve as a buyer and seller of last-resort, help reduce transaction costs and provide liquidity in periods of heightened market volatility.\n\n### Market-Making Proposal\n\nThis market-making proposal will require:\n\n- Approval for GSR to serve as an official market-making partner for Nation3.\n- An authorization to lend 2,104 NATION tokens from the community treasury to GSR to be used for providing liquidity across different venues.\n\nThe Agreement will allow GSR to repay the following NATION token amounts from the loan on the dates set out below:\n\n- 1,052 NATION tokens, 6 months from the inception date of the market-making deal, at 1,578,000 USDT*, paid to the Nation3 treasury.\n- 1,052 NATION tokens 12 months from the inception date of the market-making deal, at 2,104,000 USDT, paid to the Nation3 treasury.\n\nAt the end of the 12 month period, if GSR has not elected to repay the loan in USDT (as outlined above), GSR will return the balance of the 2,104 NATION token loan amount to the Nation3 treasury.\n\n*USDT refers to the stablecoin ‘Tether’\n\n### GSR Commits To\n\nAs part of this market-making proposal, GSR will:\n\n- Use commercially reasonable efforts to provide liquidity for any NATION token listing on supported centralized exchange venues.\n- Deploy the loan to provide liquidity to NATION token markets, and will NOT use the loan for any other commercial purposes such as lending or staking (diluting current yields).",

      "content": "## Context\nRecently the members of the Meta & Rewards guilds decided to merge under the common umbrella of the Meta Guild, that from now on will be responsible for Finance & Operations.\n\nOne of the primary responsibilities of the rewards guild was to operate the [multi-sig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7fFf737ae9FdDD6E28Fe8B8F0F4dE69Bb8e7a885) that performs payments for bounties, community distributions (through NationCred), and, lately, contributors' compensations.\n\nTo ensure the guild can perform financial operations efficiently, we need to have the most active contributors in the critical roles, such as signers of the multi-sig.\n\nThe current multi-sig configuration is:\n\n- Three confirmations per transaction are required to operate.\n- Three spots are filled by founding contributors (@luis, @anastasiya, @0xGallego)\n- Two spots are filled by candidates [elected from early community members](https://snapshot.org/#/nation3.eth/proposal/0xecc40f2a376d0d1213036389df9cd1872900bbb6758c65900ac0cefd760b10a8) (@rencai201, @tooz)\n\nTooz seems to haven't been around the organization for the last month. So, we should replace his spot with a more active contributor.\n\n## Proposal\n\nI propose to remove Tooz's spot as a signer and promote @aahna in replacement.\n\n@aahna is a self-proven, competent & active contributor:\n\n- She already holds an essential role as English Community Coordinator.\n- She is an active member of the Developers & Meta guilds.\n- She continuously participates in review work, guild management, and NationCred & Coordinape maintenance.",

      "title": "Contributor KPIs and Compensation proposal - Anastasiya Belyaeva ",
      "content": "As per the original Forum post, below I have listed out the things I’d like to work on for the next 3 months, based on what I think adds the most value at current stage.\n\nAs a background note, if I were to split it into separate Guild roadmaps, this would probably span across at least 3 different guilds, some of which currently don’t have any / almost any active members. So that would mean drafting multiple separate roadmaps for different guilds where I’d likely start off as a single contributor, meaning that Coordinape wouldn’t work (as @aahna pointed out is the case for any Circles with less 3 people).\n\nAs such, the simplest, in my view, would be to just present this as a project that I intend to focus on, with an associated budget. And anyone who’d like to propose their own focus areas in which they feel they don’t currently have enough people to form a guild around, can do the same.\n\n### Objectives & Deliverables:\n\n*1. Setting up Treasury Guild*:\n- scouting & onboarding qualified members\n- setting up tools & processes\n- proposing budget allocations\n- agreeing parameters for treasury strategies\n\n*2. Securing short-term financing through bonds*:\n- securing investors & agreeing financials\n- relaying requirements to the Developers Guild for on-chain implementation\n\n*3. Working on growth collaborations with other community projects*\n- increasing utility of $NATION as a passport to other membership-based organisations\n\n*4. Hosting AMAs to boost community growth*\n*5. Explore partnerships with Special Economic Zones or other organisations with land & funding*\n- explore joint-venture style partnerships where Nation3 could provide software layer (eg Court) and a third party would provide physical infrastructure\n*6. Recruit a community member to take on Twitter management on an ongoing basis*\n*7. Speak on behalf of Nation3 at crypto events (target 3 per quarter) to boost awareness*\n\n### Resources required\n\n- A new Treasury Guild would be formed to manage the DAO treasury - will require compensation & $NATION (amounts to be agreed at a later point, depending on individuals we get etc)\n- Developers Guild for implementing on-chain loan contract for operational financing (tasks can be added as needed on Dework)\n- Brand & Design Guild for any visuals that might be required when announcing partnerships with other community projects (tasks can be added as needed on Dework)\n- Marketing budget for AMAs / crypto events participation in exceptional cases where makes sense for Nation3, but will make every effort to keep it to minimum.\nEstimate: $5k per month (anything larger to be approved in a separate vote)\n- Other resources may be required depending on the scope of potential SEZ partnerships\n- Compensation for Twitter management (to be agreed in a separate proposal by the respective community member)\n\n## Budget to be approved by this vote \n\n*Contributor comp*\n\nI’d make compensation scope partly dependent on whether or not we are able to secure a loan and therefore pay contributors in stables (to avoid harming $NATION):\n\n- if paid in stables: 10k USDC per month\n- if paid in $NATION: $6k worth of $NATION\n\n*Dework bounties*\n\n(to encourage community contributors to participate)\n- $1.5-2k worth of $NATION per month\n\n*Marketing budget*\n\nup to 5k USDC or $3k worth of $NATION",

      "content": "## Background\n\nLast week I talked with one of the Bankless Community members, who is responsible for cross-DAO collaborations. We discussed different ways in which Nation3 could collaborate with BanklessDAO with the purpose of:\n\n* community cross-pollination\n* educating the Bankless community on Nation3 mission\n* introducing ways for them to get involved in practice\n\nIn my view, the Bankless community is one of the largest, ideologically aligned communities in the ecosystem, and their members are very knowledgeable, hard-working and well organised, as I’ve seen from their Discord. They have:\n\n* 49.5k followers on Twitter\n* 26.6k Discord members\n* 148k Youtube followers\n\n## Proposal\n\nI think it would be super valuable for us to work with them and spread the word on Nation3 there as the two communities could be very complementary.\n\nTypically, BanklessDAO offers AMAs as the first step to collaborate. They cost $5,000 and involve (on their side):\n\n• Working with the client to create a marketing banner and a POAP\n• Tweeting about the event before, during, and after\n• Creating a calendar event and marketing that in the Community Call\n• Organising guest passes for the partner’s guest list\n• Presenting the live AMA within the Discord\n• Streaming the event live to YouTube, which serves as an archive of the event\n\nMore details on their AMA offer are [here](https://bankless.notion.site/AMA-Details-16322920013a4c2c8b22ddd779505279).\n\nFollowing the Forum discussion, this proposal is to approve $5k for the AMA, while in parallel continue planning non-financial collaboration as well.

      "title": "Proposal: Budget for Swag",
      "content": "## Proposal\nAs Nation3 has marked its birth, it’s already winning the hearts and minds of thousands of community members.\n\nTo continue building on this momentum and generate a deeper sense of belonging, I’d like to propose the creation of dopest swag ever created. Why? Because at the end of the day, Nation3 is a movement centered around culture - the culture of freedom, peace and prosperity.\n\nRead the proposal for specific pieces of swag below.\n\n## Specifications\n### Swag Types\nI would like to propose two types of designs for swag items: the Genesis Citizen swag, only accessible to the upcoming Passport holders of Genesis type, and Nation3 community swag, available to purchase by the general public irrespective of their passport type or Nation3 membership. As the Ordinary passport type is introduced, swag could easily be updated to include this category of citizens, too.\n\nI believe the Genesis type swag and the general public swag are equally important for different purposes: the former serves as a symbol of unity that connects early members of the community and rewards their trust in the emerging cloud country; the latter helps spread the infectious movement beyond existing members, fuelling community & culture growth.\n\n### Specific Items\nThrough a Forum poll, the community voted on the below top items:\n\n- Passport cases/holders that say (”I am a citizen of Nation3”)\n- Nation3 flags\n- Denim jackets\n\n### Distribution Venues\nI propose to send out Nation3 ‘welcome packs’ for free to all of its Genesis Citizens. This will be a one-off campaign and should serve as an additional incentive to claim the first NFT passports.\n\nThe community swag would be available to buy on the nation3.org website via Printful on-demand printing.\n\n## Resources Required\nAs per the budget calculated for the project (available to check on the Forum discussion), a total of ~ €65,000 would be required to carry out the budget, which includes:\n\n- design work\n- production of the 3 types of products + custom box\n- shipment, storage & assembly of all welcome packs\n- estimate for global shipment to individual addresses\n\nIf approved, the budget amount would be taken from stable assets in the treasury (which are currently in the process of diversification).",

      "title": "Proposal: Set up initial rewards guild",
      "content": "## Background\nDAOs need to do work, and they rely on contributors to do so.\nA marvelous product released lately is [Dework](https://dework.xyz).\n\n## Proposal\nI have already set up a Nation3 workspace on Dework, and allowed for contributors to make suggestions, and also in the future we can allow citizens to post new tasks, etc.\nIn order to make pay outs to contributors, we need some NATION, and asking the DAO each time to pay small NATION bounties is cumbersome and costly.\nTherefore I'd like to propose creating a guild that can make payouts. Thanks to Dework's integration with Gnosis Safe, payouts can be batched so signatories can approve payouts each week, for example, instead of having to do that each time.\nSignatories won't have the responsibility to review submissions and accept contributions. That will be the responsibility of core contributors, and in the future of other guilds (e.g. tech guild, comms guild). Rather, they would just verify that someone has reviewed the contribution and approved it, and they will execute the payment.\n\n## Specifications\n- Create a Gnosis Safe with 5 members, and 3/5 threshold for proposals.\n- Transfer 5 NATION to it each month. If there's need to increase this amount, a new governance proposal will be needed. If this guild needs to be phased out in the future, a Snapshot vote will suffice and the DAO will stop with the monthly payouts.\n\n## Candidacy\nTwo community members will be elected via a vote.\nThree core contributors: @0xGallego, @Anastasiya and @Luis will initially be part of the guild to ensure correct functioning in its infancy.\n\nThe alias of candidates can be seen in this Snapshot vote, and their individual candidacy posts can be read on the [forum thread](https://forum.nation3.org/t/proposal-set-up-initial-rewards-guild/256).",

      "title": "Proposal: Perform minimal treasury diversification",
      "content": "## Background\nRight now the DAO is very well capitalized, but it just holds NATION and some ETH.\nNATION is the most important asset for the DAO to hold, as it's the heart of the community when it comes to economic alignment.\nETH is also fine as it's the platform that makes this all possible.\nHowever, the DAO might need some other tokens in order to hedge market risk, and also to pay certain providers that would only take fiat, therefore needing stablecoins (to interact with the physical world).\n\n## Proposal\nBecause of the initial liquidity seeded by the DAO in the Balancer pool, the DAO has generated some profits.\n\nI propose to withdraw some ETH from the Balancer pool, and to withdraw 50 NATION from the DAO's treasury. We can do this at the same time or just after kickstarting liquidity rewards, since there will be significant liquidity then.\n\n## Specifications\n- Withdraw some ETH (to vote on) from the Balancer pool, and keep it in the DAO.\n- Withdraw 50 NATION from the DAO to 0xbac3ab60a1643e5f5de8eb62cb4bb232711d9dcd (address I use for Nation3) to be diversified into WBTC. The reason for doing this is that we need to do one trade a day, to not impact the market's price, and the DAO's voting time is 2 days, so it's infeasible. In the future we won't do it like this, since it requires trust (see final section).\n- With current volumes, diversifying 50 NATION should be done over at least 5 days to not impact the price.\n- Pay back 13 ETH to Luis (myself), which is the amount of ETH I lent to the DAO to seed initial liquidity in the Balancer pool. [Proof](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd49f11e050fa55a99f4aa28621a4a0eaf1a0a247e127b89a85359b31d0a0dd75).\n\n## Future proposal\nThis is a one-off proposal for now. In the near future, we should create a committee of experts in treasury management who can have some leeway in managing some of the DAO's funds. Such proposal will require more thought, but should come soon.\n",

      "title": "Proposal to launch first round of liquidity rewards",
      "content": "## Background\n\nOn April 8th 2022, Nation3 was born as a movement towards a peaceful future of interconnected communities: cloud countries and crypto cities powered by the Web3 stack.\n\nTo mark its birth, today 2150 $NATION have been distributed in a [tweetdrop](https://twitter.com/Nation3DAO/status/1516825183398547461?s=20&t=zULs9Wsh54cq6UhqR4FDIQ) to 2150 addresses. Today, these 2150 members constitute the core of the Nation3 community, and some of them will become Genesis Citizens and receive the first ever Nation3 passports, granting them the right to govern the cloud nation in its [bicameral system](https://wiki.nation3.org/token/#nft-passports).\n\n## Proposal\n\nTo continue building the momentum for Nation3 and drive its growth, I’d like to propose a liquidity mining program for the NATION / ETH Balancer pool. I believe that a well designed incentives program will achieve the following objectives:\n\n* boost liquidity provision in the early days of the project, therefore removing friction for early participants from purchasing $NATION\n* by extension, allow a larger number of participants to lock their $NATION in exchange for [$veNATION](https://wiki.nation3.org/token/#venation), turning them into long-term incentivized community members and governance participants\n* through $veNATION, provide access to [Genesis NFT Passports](https://wiki.nation3.org/token/#nft-passports), defining the community of very first Nation3 Citizens and active governance members\n* allow the possibility of the decentralized, [bicameral governance system](https://wiki.nation3.org/governance/)\n* support the ecosystem growth over the long-term\n\nAdditionally, to reward and incentivize the long-term alignment with the DAO, I propose to introduce boosted incentives for $veNATION holders. As successfully implemented by [Balancer (veBAL)](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/introducing-vebal-tokenomics/2512) and [Curve (veCRV)](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-gauges.html), among other projects, boosted rewards encourage participants to lock their $NATION for the longest time period, which in turn ensures:\n\n* an incentive for $NATION to be taken out of circulation due to the holders’ long-term commitment, creating a sink that might serve for $NATION to accrue value\n* economic alignment of the DAO’s governance members towards long-term success of the project\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Liquidity Pool\n\nThe proposed incentive program would apply to the only currently existing [NATION / ETH](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x0bf37157d30dfe6f56757dcadff01aed83b08cd600020000000000000000019a) Balancer pool with an 80 / 20 ratio.\n\n### Budget\n\nI propose the program to start with an initial budget of 900 NATION, to be allocated as liquidity incentives across 6 months. Should the impact of this first incentive program be as desired, governance can choose to propose another vote to extend the program.\n\n### Performance scenarios\n\nFive scenarios that might transpire over the course of the liquidity rewards program are modeled out below with a 3 month timeframe:\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nation3/original/1X/10eb2868ee2c99f1f7acf3147b53a68e93e61208.png)\n\n\nIn the conservative scenario where 2500 NATION and 52 ETH are supplied to the liquidity pool (totalling in $781,250 in liquidity), the incentive program would generate Liquidity Providers (LPs) a 115% APY, which is highly competitive in today’s market conditions.\n\nIn the scenario where the liquidity pool reaches $25m, the APY would still remain significant at 72%.\n\n### $veNATION boost\n\nOn top of the liquidity incentives proposed above, the $veNATION holders would be able to boost their $NATION rewards by a factor of 2.5, effectively reducing slightly the rewards from non-$veNATION holders.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis proposal puts forward a liquidity incentives program that is essential at the early days of the project to capitalize on the launch momentum and drive its growth. A total of 900 $NATION is proposed as the optimal initial budget to be allocated as rewards over 6 months, with the possibility of extending the program with a new governance vote. $veNATION holders would receive a 2.5x boost to their rewards, diluting non-$veNATION holders in their rewards.",

      "title": "Proposal to issue Genesis NFT Passports",
      "content": "## Background\nOn April 8th 2022, Nation3 was born as a movement towards a peaceful future of interconnected communities: cloud countries and crypto cities powered by the Web3 stack.\n\nTo mark its birth, today 2150 $NATION have been distributed in a [tweetdrop](https://twitter.com/Nation3DAO/status/1512472974921814017?s=20&t=zULs9Wsh54cq6UhqR4FDIQ) to 2150 addresses.\n\n[](https://forum.nation3.org/#proposal-2)Proposal\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nTo turn this community of token holders into the first Nation3 Citizens, I propose the creation of a limited edition Genesis Citizen NFT Passports.\n\nNFT passport holders will be the core users of all Nation3 services that might be available in the future, and simultaneously those that drive forward the cloud nation in its [bicameral governance system](https://wiki.nation3.org/token/#nft-passports).\n\nThey will be the ones that make proposals, conduct research, carry out initiatives, structure themselves into working groups, and do everything else that's required to successfully kickstart a cloud nation. The Genesis Citizens will invest their time and expertise into the project, while making use of the funds from the Nation3 DAO.\n\nIn the first instance, I propose to issue a limited edition of Genesis NFTs to ensure the community grows at a sustainable rate where coordination is possible. Once the DAO decides that the community is ready to expand, more passport tiers could be issued.\n\n## Specifications\n### Token Gated Discord\n\nThe Genesis NFT passport holders would have access to the majority of token-gated Discord channels, ensuring that the community coordination is efficient, manageable, and productive. The overview of channels that would be made available to NFT passport holders can be found below:\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nation3/optimized/1X/16c9b42edb7a40a023349a2da07b4e2b5afdc562_2_337x402.png)\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/nation3/original/1X/16c9b42edb7a40a023349a2da07b4e2b5afdc562.png)\n\n### How to get a Genesis NFT passport\n\nNFT passports would be non-transferrable, and would only be minted by those that hold the required amount of $veNATION. This ensures that citizens have long-term economic alignment.\n\nTo receive the Genesis NFT passport, a minimum balance of 2 $veNATION would be required. Given that $veNATION balance decreases over time as the remainder of the lock decreases, it would need to be renewed to keep the NFT passport. If a $veNATION holder who is a Genesis Citizen doesn't renew their lock and allows for the required $veNATION balance to drop, therefore lacking any long-term commitment, the NFT passport would be burned.\n\nIt's important to note that the nature of $veNATION token breaks the barrier to become a Genesis Citizen for those with minimal funds available: because longer-term commitment magnifies veNATION holdings, staking for 4 years would only require 2 $NATION, while staking for 1 year would require 8 $NATION to be eligible for a passport.\n\n### Governance\n\nAs per the bicameral governance system, Genesis Citizens would carry the bulk of the governance responsibility. They would make proposals and decisions within the Nation3 DAO, which would then need to be ratified by $veNATION holders.\n\n### Financial incentives\n\nIn the future, a separate vote could be proposed for Genesis Citizens to be rewarded through Governance Mining, meaning that they would receive $NATION rewards as long as they meet their governance responsibilities. This is not included in the scope of the current proposal.\n\nThe Genesis Citizens would also receive all of the $veNATION financial incentives, as they are by default also $veNATION holders.\n\n### Designs\nYou can check some initial designs and artworks for the passports in the [forum thread](https://forum.nation3.org/t/proposal-to-issue-genesis-nft-passports/26).\n\n### Amount of passports to be issued\n\nI propose to limit the Genesis NFT passports to 420 only. Apart from being the magic internet number and resonating with $NATION's 42069 total supply, it would ensure:\n1.  Strong demand for the NFT passport from token economic perspective.\n2.  Create a sufficiently large, yet manageable initial community of engaged members.\n\n## Conclusion\nI propose the creation of Genesis NFT passports to define the first ever community of Nation3 citizens. This proposal outlines the governance rights, eligibility criteria, benefits, and financial incentives of holding a Genesis NFT passport.\n\nPlease vote on how many Genesis NFT passports you think should be created in the first instance. Bear in mind that once the initial community is formed, the DAO can choose to create another tier of NFT passports in the future.",
