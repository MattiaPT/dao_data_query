      "content": "An increasing number of governments around the world are labeling the MLM business model as an illegal business model. Pylon Ecosystem also needs to remove this system and implement the legal business model as all other legit programs are doing the Affiliate marketing program. As I can see, the Apple App Store has prevented the app from displaying multi-level referrals. We must follow a more legal and legitimate business process to stand Pylon Ecosystem in the market without any problem.Please provide the total multi-level Referral incentive of 10% to the Affiliate Marketing program. This way, the user who works hard to promote the program will earn 100% of the incentive given by the company.This will help to take the Pylon Ecosystem to a more legitimate program.If you agree, please vote for YES and support this proposal.",

The more CGIR value purchase will have more voting power. Management team, please think of it. Let's bring democracy into the project.I have seen more than 9k users from Nigeria. The free CGIR $10 is to bring more users around the world, not from one single country. I think we need to stop allowing more than required free users per county.The free CGIR per county should be around 2-5k per country as it is only for the first 100k users. This will also help stop misuse of the voting power and rights we give for free to all new users.If you guys support my idea, please vote for yes.",

And the optimum daily limit is 250$. This way, the user needs to purchase in 5-7 installments or even more if they wish to purchase a package worth $1000.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">E.g., if a user purchases the first CGIR package worth $10 on the first day, he should start from $10, $20, $40, and $80, respectively, in the next few days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The project initiated this way to make their user experience the package and educate them about its working method. But I think it&rsquo;s a bit lengthy process to reach $1000 starting from the minimum process.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">My proposal is to eradicate the multiplier effect and make the daily limit to $100 irrespective of the previous purchase. And also, make the max daily limit $100 instead of $250.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This way, users can purchase up to $100 per day irrespective of previous purchases, and those who want to invest more can purchase in the multiple of $100.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So, by implementing this, the system won&rsquo;t be more complex and will be more user-friendly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you think this could make the CGIR membership system more efficient, please vote YES.</p>",

I want to create a proposal that helps the project toward a bright future.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">There needs to be more liquidity in the project, and trading volumes have also dropped in the last couple of months. We all users should do something on our part to create liquidity. We need to onboard as many users as possible in the ecosystem.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">We have Community Growth Incentive Reward (CGIR) Membership, which gives a yearly net of 50% APY, and a total return reward of up to 160% in the stablecoin. This should attract new users to join the Pylon Ecosystem. I purchased a membership worth $1000, which is the max limit of the project.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">This way, users can earn up to 160% of their purchases in around a year. The beauty of this PETN project is that it offers ICO buyback, which no other crypto project offers. Those who do not agree with the community or the project's decisions can happily ask for a buyback program.</span></p><p><br></p><p><em style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Let me share some key points about Community Growth Reward:</em></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">It offers a free airdrop loan of $10 to everyone as part of its community growth incentive reward system, giving you a total growth reward of $16. These earnings can be withdrawn or used within the Pylon Ecosystem. We all should offer free $10 to everyone we know to bring users into the ecosystem.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">The paid membership purchase limit is between $10 and $1000, offering up to 160% return within approximately one year. It also has a 100% refund policy for 99 days, with no questions asked.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">In addition to these benefits, It also offers a 15% incentive on the level 5 referral network to encourage growth within the community.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">The best part for all of us is when users keep purchasing memberships, the price of PETN should gradually grow, as the purchase is made via PETN only. The project will only succeed if this can bring the users to the ecosystem. Our responsibility is to support projects at our level best to save them from failing.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Please give a Yes Vote if you agree with me.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p>",
