      "content": "Hey folks. \nTwo of your community members mentioned DSD in our group recently, I've done some digging and I really like the project. Incentivising a PEG is a very interesting approach for a stable coin, and perfectly captures the essence of DeFi while providing a unique way of producing the stable coin use case. I'm personally invested, and am a proud bonded CDSD holder.\n\nAbout me - I'm a software engineer of 10 years on front end, back end, game dev, web dev, integration etc. I'm now a Technical Lead for the day job, and I'm also a crypto reviewer for https://t.me/ProReviewGems, write articles, host AMA's etc. and pride myself on being able to communicate complex projects in a way that non techies can understand.\n\nProReviews:\nThere are four of us in the ProReview team, and we focus on new platforms with unique utilities, and our community expect in depth analysis and research on anything we cover. Here's an example of a previous article and AMA we did for Coval for example:\nhttps://www.professionalsreview.com/post/circuitsofvalue\nhttps://www.professionalsreview.com/post/pro-review-gems-ama-with-coval\n\nOur group is small (830 members currently), though has grown hugely in the last few weeks. However, our community is very engaged due to our detailed approach, and expect the level of detail we are providing them through the detailed analysis we carry out on any platform before hosting an AMA or writing an article.\n\nI'd like to write up an article and host you for an AMA. I've been in discussions with Ravage, and they are happy join us if you, the community are interested in supporting it.\nIn terms of how much, it is up to you what you feel it is worth. Previous clients have paid us up to $1500 for AMA + AMA Writeup + Deep dive article + Multiple mentions in our TG group + TA + tweets. But we want to grow, and I like DSD, so we're happy to accept whatever you folks feel is appropriate.\n\nThanks for listening, Celty. \nhttps://twitter.com/CeltyCrypto",
