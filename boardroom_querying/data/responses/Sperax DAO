      "title": "SIP-68: Demeter 2.0 Farms and Emissions",
      "content": "Author: Sperax Core Team\n\nReference: [SIP-63: Demeter 2.0 launch](https://forum.sperax.io/t/sip-63-demeter-2-0-Launch/1228)\nCreated: October 9, 2024\n\n## Summary\nIn July 2024, SperaxDAO launched Demeter 2.0, a steady APR farm to increase USDs liquidity and facilitate deeper concentrated liquidity of new tokens with USDs. While the APR wasn’t fixed, it was more predictable than the current model. Reward token managers set and adjusted the APR based on the farm’s Total Value Locked (TVL), providing more consistent rewards for liquidity providers. We used the ARB tokens from the LTIPP program to facilitate a higher reward rate\n\nWith the end of the LTIPP cycle, we now wish to take Demeter 2.0 back to a sustainable reward rate. This proposal aims to allocate rewards for new farms being set up as an upgrade to Demeter 2.0\n\n## Motivation\nIncentivise farms based on the TVL contained in one or more farm assets.\nConfigurable reward rate for all farms which Farm owners can manage\nBetter user experience and improved interaction with the interface\nNew farms with xSPA allocation\n\n## Overview\nAs we reach the end of the high reward period under the Long-Term Incentive Pilot Program (LTIPP), it is essential to review our performance and define the way forward. Despite our efforts to boost liquidity across Demeter 2.0 farms, we were only able to distribute 4% of the allocated 250,500 ARB tokens. The original TVL targets of $20 million in Demeter and $10 million in USDs were not fully achieved.\n\nWith the high-reward phase coming to a close, we will transition to a more sustainable reward structure. The future emissions will be adjusted in line with the current Total Value Locked (TVL) in the farms, focusing on providing consistent incentives to liquidity providers based on the existing liquidity. This recalibration ensures that rewards remain aligned with ecosystem participation while promoting long-term liquidity growth.\n\nOur immediate priority is to maintain stability in the reward system and support the ongoing liquidity in the ecosystem. By adjusting emissions to match liquidity levels, we aim to ensure a balanced approach that supports both liquidity providers and the overall health of the ecosystem as we move forward.\n \n![1.jpg](ipfs://bafkreiaekwnbtzuo56r6npeisqejb4ue2oudd6hc6hrypusk2ovmnx3ezm)\n    \nApart from the farm mentioned above, any other farms will follow the following APR structure\n\n \n![2.jpg](ipfs://bafkreibn6jkiuedh2ngtn4vdh23v6dub73yru6pgo5rripixe3w7isepfu)\n    \n\n## Technical Specifications\nDemeter farm emissions will be calculated based on the new methodology\n\n## Voting\n#### For: \nImplement new rewards distribution methodology\n#### Against: \nDo not implement the new rewards distribution methodology",

      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Core Team\nReference: USDs, Revenue, Burn, veSPA\nCreated: Aug 2nd, 2024\n\n## Summary\nWe have had the 50% / 50% split of revenue/yield from USDs collateral strategies since the inception of USDs. This proposal aims to increase the revenue share for USDs holders, increase SPA burns, and identify a risk mitigation strategy.\n\n## Motivation\nUSDs yield reserves are depleting and we need to maintain a high yield on USDs\nSPA buyback and burns are not significant.\nWe need a security module/hedge for shortfall events or loss in collateral.\n\n## Overview\nYield is generated organically by sending collateral to audited decentralized finance protocols. 50% of yield generated on collateral is used to pay USDs holders Auto-Yield. The remaining 50% of the yield is used to buy back SPA from the market. 50% of the SPA received is burnt and 50% is used to reward veSPA holders. \n\nUSDs reserves are depleting and we should maintain a high yield to keep USDs a premium stablecoin opportunity compared to other available stablecoins in the market. By increasing the revenue share of USDs auto yield by 40%, we maintain a high yield on liquid USDs. This will take the revenue share of USDs yield to 70% from the collaterals.\n\nWe have to start thinking about risk mitigation for USDs holders. We need a safety vault or a risk strategy to account for a loss in collateral. We can put in 15% of the revenue received from USDs collateral strategies to develop a plan for risk management.\n\nThe SPA burn is quite insignificant since USDs TVL is quite low. We propose SPA burn share 30% of the revenue for now. Once we have identified a risk mitigation strategy, the SPA burn revenue will decrease to 15%.\n\nIncrease the emission for veSPA holders to 420 000 xSPA tokens per week from the treasury to account for the decrement in APR due to cutting the allocation from bought-back SPA. \n\nThe APR contribution towards veSPA rewards has been pretty low (0.25-0.75%) since the last two quarters hence it will not affect the current APR as much.\n\n## Technical Specifications\n* Increase the revenue share for USDs holders, currently at 50%, from the yield strategies to 70%. \n* 30% of the remaining yield will be used to buy back SPA from the market and burn it.\n* Identify and implement a risk mitigation strategy for USDs collateral. Once implemented, 15% of the revenue will go into this strategy and the SPA burn will be reduced to 15%.\n* Increase emission from the treasury to veSPA holders to 420 000 xSPA tokens per week.\n\n## Voting\n#### For:\nApprove change in revenue structure, implement risk mitigation strategy, and increase emissions to veSPA holders from the treasury\n#### Against: \nReject change in revenue structure, implement risk mitigation strategy, and increase veSPA emissions from the treasury",

      "title": "SIP-63: Demeter 2.0 Launch",
      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Core Team\nReference: Demeter 2.0, LTIPP, Incentives\nCreated: June 20th, 2024\n\n## Summary\nDemeter protocol is a new protocol for DAOs to launch and manage decentralized exchange liquidity without knowing how to code.\n\nDemeter 2.0 is an upgraded version of Demeter version 1. Demeter 2.0 will give the power to farm creators to launch incentivized farms on Camelot V3 and Uniswap V3. This proposal aims to allocate rewards for seven new farms being set up with the launch of Demeter 2.0\n\n**Motivation**\n\n* Incentivise farms based on the TVL contained in one or more assets in the farm.\n* Configurable reward rate for all farms which Farm owners can manage\n* Better user experience and improved interaction with the interface\n\n## Overview\nProtocols seeking to incentivize liquidity on Demeter often faced a challenge - a lack of direct correlation between increased incentives and increased liquidity. We're introducing a new \"Steady APR Farm\" on Demeter 2.0 to address this. While the APR isn't fixed, it will be more predictable than the current model. Reward token managers can set and adjust the APR based on the farm's Total Value Locked (TVL), providing more consistent rewards for liquidity providers.\n\nWe've been selected for Arbitrum Foundation's Long-Term Incentive Pilot Program (LTIPP). The Sperax DAO will receive 250,500 ARB tokens to distribute across seven new Demeter 2.0 farms by September 2nd.\n\nAdditionally, the Sperax DAO will match these ARB rewards with SPA and xSPA tokens, distributing a total of 32 million SPA within the LTIPP timeframe. Our goal is to reach a TVL of $20 million on Demeter and $10 million in USDs during the LTIPP.\n\nThe total TVL and emission targets are mentioned below in the table.\n\n![Table1.jpg](ipfs://bafkreifycgkhdnkdob62hwslkoeex3s5q3ffgq6y4qf4gtrda43ge6dxey)\n    \nAPR will initially be set to 25% in ARB and 25% SPA/xSPA for the following farms on Camelot V3\n\n1. USDC/USDs\n2. USDC.e/USDs\n3. USDT/USDs\n4. wETH/USDs\n5. ARB/USDs\n6. wBTC/USDs\n\n\nAPR will initially be set to 25% in ARB and 75% SPA/xSPA for the following farm on Camelot V3:\n\n1. SPA/USDs\n\nAs the total Demeter 2.0 TVL and farm TVL increase, the APR will be adjusted to optimize the rewards to achieve the TVL target. A new proposal will be presented to finalize the reward APR post the LTIPP timeline.\n\nThe daily reward rate can be changed based on total Demeter TVL and individual farm TVL.  We will set the maximum rewards release per day every week. Keeping the target TVL in mind, the maximum rewards per day are mentioned below.\n\n|Week|Max ARB rewards per day|Max SPA rewards per day|Max xSPA rewards per day|\n| ----- | --- | --- | --- |\n|1|763|15263|61050|\n|2|1068|21368|85470|\n|3|1496|29915|119658|\n|4|1885|40205|160821|\n|5|2345|56287|225149|\n|6|2955|75519|302075|\n|7|3907|101129|404517|\n|8|5148|141581|566324|\n|9|6757|180194|720776|\n|10|9460|252272|1009087|\n\nUSDs will be used as the base token for xSPA/SPA incentives and the pairing token (USDC, USDT, wBTC, etc) will be used as the base token for ARB incentives.\n\nFor the Camelot v3 pools, the price ranges are mentioned below.\n\n|Farms|Min Price|Max Price|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|USDC/USDs|0.95 USDs|1.05 USDs|\n|USDC.e/USDs|0.95 USDs|1.05 USDs|\n|USDT/USDs|0.95 USDs|1.05 USDs|\n|wETH/USDs|2500 USDs|4500 USDs|\n|ARB/USDs|0.6 USDs|1.3 USDs|\n|wBTC/USDs|42000 USDs|78000 USDs|\n|SPA/USDs|0.003 USDs|0.020 USDs|\n\nThe users will earn fees APR in Grail and xGrail which is on top of the rewards APR.\n\n## Technical Specifications\n* Launch Demeter 2.0 and 7 new farms as stated in the overview\n* Allocate 32 million SPA tokens to be distributed in the first 10 weeks of Demeter 2.0\n* Allocate all LTIPP grants of 250500 ARB tokens in the first 10 weeks of Demeter 2.0\n* Release the incentives in the proposed order as mentioned in the overview\n\n## Voting\n**For**:  Implement SIP-63\n**Against**: Don't implement this proposal",

This proposal seeks to streamline and optimize the collateral portfolio by removing three assets: LUSD, DAI, and FRAX.\n\n#### Motivation\nOver 96.8% of the stablecoin market cap on Arbitrum is USDT and USDC. Sperax is coming up with its own CDP stablecoin\n\n#### Overview\n\nLUSD, DAI, and FRAX collectively represent only approximately 3% of the total stablecoin market capitalization. This limited share suggests that their removal will have a negligible impact on the overall stability and utility of USDs.\n\nWe are actively developing our Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) stablecoin. This upcoming product will offer users an alternative decentralized stablecoin option within our ecosystem, reducing the need for external stablecoins like LUSD, DAI, and FRAX as collateral.\n\nUpon passing of this proposal, new minting of USDs will stop from LUSD, DAI, and FRAX.

      "content": "Author: Sperax Core Team\nCreated: April, 2, 2024\nLabels: Product-Features, USDs-Parameters\n\n## Summary\nWith [SIP-52](https://snapshot.org/#/speraxdao.eth/proposal/0xb007f7caec7b1372333f85ce577040cc863de62532c536f7210fe39988664b56), SperaxDAO introduced USDs 2.0 and put a maximum cap on auto-yield APR at 10%. This proposal aims to increase the maximum cap of USDs auto yield.\n\n## Motivation\nThe stablecoin market has been pretty strong in the Arbitrum ecosystem.\nReturns on stablecoin supply to various protocols have been on the higher side\nUSDs TVL has been decreasing\n\n## Overview\nWith the excitement and volume coming back into the crypto market, the yield on stablecoins especially on the lending platforms has been surging. This is a consequence of a high borrowing demand, with traders willing to pay high borrow-APRs.\n\nSince demand for stablecoin is back, the delta-neutral yield earning strategies are giving good returns on stables. This means good returns on USDs collaterals. However, the available yield opportunities across the protocol are far better than the 10% capped APR of USDs. This results in decrement in USDs TVL considerably even though the (APR + fees) on USDs stable farms in Demeter is over 40%. USDs is not being able to attract stable suppliers.\n\nThe high demand for stables in the market still seems to be growing as all the lending protocols are almost maxed out. We believe that the demand will remain the same for a few quarters at least and USDs collaterals also help in supplying to that demand. To make USDs attractive it is required to match up to the returns available in the market on stables with some extra rewards.\n\nTo address this we propose to increase the capped USDs auto-yield APR to 25%. The extra yield over 25% will go to the yield reserves and will be used to fund the low yield periods.\n\n## Technical Specification\nIncrease APR cap for USDs auto-yield to 25% from 10%\n\n## Voting\n\nFor: Increase the USDs APR cap to 25%\nAgainst: Do not implement this proposal",

      "content": "Author: [Fluidity Labs](https://x.com/fluiditylabs) \nCreated: February 13, 2024\nLabels: #Liquidity-mining\n\n## Simple Summary\n### Proposal\n\nFluidity Money proposes to work together with Sperax to set up a fUSDC-USDs Camelot V2 pool via Demeter. This pool would be incentivized through SIP-58 to bootstrap liquidity, with additional 5% xSPA rewards. Additional Utility Mining incentives in $ARB will be added on top of the aforementioned incentives, to be paid out whenever a trade with fUSDC occurs.\n\n### Introduction to Fluid Assets and Utility Mining\n\nFluidity Money is a DeFi protocol that allows users to wrap stablecoins in return for fluid assets (i.e. USDC → ƒUSDC). The stablecoins deposited are lent out on money markets like AAVE, and the yield generated is collected in a reward pool.\n\nWhenever a user transacts a Fluid Asset, they can earn yield from this pool in a no-loss lottery on every transaction. The yield is dynamic and depends on chain variables, with more transactions and higher TVL resulting in more yield. Whenever a transaction is yield bearing, it is split between sender and receiver on an 80–20% split respectively.\n\nAny type of yield can be added on top of the rewards, such as governance tokens or NFTs. This is called Utility Mining and represents a novel way of distributing tokens through the usage of a protocol.\n\nCareful economic modeling ensures resilience against misuse and maintains utility, embodying the platform’s commitment to making finance accessible and rewarding for all.\n\n## Motivation\nFluidity is introducing a new narrative centered around incentivising Utility and steering order flow. Through fUSDC, protocols can utilize a novel toolset to better distribute incentives to aligned users and steer productive volume to themselves.\n\nSperax and USDs will greatly benefit from this through increased activity and higher productive volume going through the pool, as every transaction on the pool will be incentivised with $ARB tokens through Utility Mining. This helps attract more traders to the pool and attract higher liquidity as a second order effect.\n\n##   Overview\n###   Proposal\n\nWe propose the setup of an incentivized fUSDC-USDs pool and bootstrapping it with liquidity to start it off. The pool will be launched on Camelot V2. For the incentives, we are referring to SIP-58 with additional 5% xSPA rewards.\n\nAdditionally, Fluidity will add Utility Mining incentives to the pool, with up to 5k in ARB distributed over the first month.\n\n## Voting\n\nFor:  Start fUSDC-USDs Pool on Camelot V2, add SIP-58 emissions with additional 5% xSPA rewards and 5k ARB Utility Mining incentives distributed over one month\n\nAgainst: Reject the proposal",

      "title": "SIP-58: Close the Gauge",
      "content": "Author: Sperax Core Team\nCreated: November 24, 2023\nLabels: #SPA-Gauge, #veSPA-emissions, #Demeter\n\n### Summary\nIn 2023, SperaxDAO launched SPA Gauge to increase USDs liquidity and facilitate deeper concentrated liquidity of new tokens with USDs. The ecosystem experienced some growth during the early days. Lately, liquidity has moved out of the ecosystem, and the SPA gauge has been unsuccessful in retaining any liquidity either for USDs or Demeter.\n\n### **Motivation**\n- Since the launch of SPA Gauge, Sperax treasury has emitted over half a million dollars to Demeter farms. The Demeter and USDs TVL has halved in the last five months.\n- The target is to increase USDs adoption, which will help grow the Sperax ecosystem and benefit its participants. We must rethink our reward mechanism to direct emissions.\n\n### **Overview**\nApart from maintaining the target to make SPA deflationary, SperaxDAO should ensure that the emissions have a direct effect on increasing the ecosystem TVL. It should also be recognized that with increased TVL, the reward rate should also increase to facilitate larger deeper liquidity. Upon reviewing the performance of the SPA Gauge, the sperax team has decided to propose the closure of the SPA Gauge.\n\nThe xSPA, currently being emitted as bribes, will be directed as emissions for veSPA holders (As has been the case before the launch of SPA Gauge). Earlier, we executed a reduction in bribes by 20% through [SIP-56](https://snapshot.org/#/speraxdao.eth/proposal/0xb8b672f554be5ec3083861e765b5a69098091b043f1c191486a892fc528898bf). The current bribe amount is 306840 xSPA tokens. We propose to increase the emissions amount by 25% to 383550 xSPA tokens.\n\nFollowing the principle of proportionating emissions with USDs and SPA holdings, the APR for any farm should directly depend on the SPA or USDs holdings in the farms. Also, the APR should change(increase) as the SPA+USD holdings increase. We propose to implement the following methodology to identify the APR for any farm. \n\n| Range start (in $) | Range ends (in $) | Range APR |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | 5000 | 0.00% |\n| 5001 | 20000 | 7.50% |\n| 20001 | 100000 | 15% |\n| 100001 | 250000 | 20% |\n| 250001 | 500000 | 25% |\n| 500001 | 1000000 | 30% |\n| 1000001 | 2000000 | 35% |\n| Above 2000000 |  | 40% |\n\nFor example, any farm having a liquidity of $330,000/- in (USDs+SPA)  will have the following APR\n\n*APR = [{(330000-250000)*25 + (250000-100000)*20 + (100000-20000)*15 + (20000-5000)*7.5 +(5000-0)*0}/330000] = 19.12%*\n\nAnd if any farm has a liquidity of $860000/- in (USDs+SPA) will have the following APR\n\n*APR = [{(830000-500000)*30 + (500000-250000)*25 + (250000-100000)*20 + (100000-20000)*15 + (20000-5000)*7.5 +(5000-0)*0}/830000] = 24.53%*\n\nFor any SPA/USDs farm the APR will be 5 times the APR calculated through the methodology. As per the new methodology, the expected APR for the farms eligible for emissions is mentioned below.\n\n| Farm | TVL | New APR |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| USDC/USDs Uniswap v3 | $298,108.09 | 15.39% |\n| USDs/USDC.e Uniswap v3 | $269,631.67 | 14.90% |\n| PLS/USDs Uniswap v3 | $140,070.88 | 12.32% |\n| USDs/USDC.e Camelot | $277,804.29 | 15.05% |\n| plsSPA/SPA Uniswap v3 | $268,357.61 | 14.88% |\n| SPA/USDs Camelot | $102,895.92 | 68.12% |\n| SPA/USDs Uniswap v3 | $93,722.42 | 66.10% |\n| fxUSD/USDs Uniswap v3 | $45,482.55 | 12.60% |\n| WETH/USDs Uniswap v3 | $17,335.52 | 7.50% |\n| ARB/USDs Uniswap v3 | $5,977.52 | 7.50% |\n\nThe emission will be decided every week on Wednesday based on the average daily holding of the past seven days.\n\n### **Technical Specifications**\n- SPA Gauge will be closed\n- xSPA bribes will directed to veSPA emissions with an increment of 25%.\n- Demeter farm emissions will be calculated based on the new methodology\n\n### **Voting**\n#### For \nClose SPA gauge, redirect emissions to veSPA, and implement new emissions methodology\n#### Against\nDo not close the SPA Gauge",

      "content": "Author: Sperax Core Team\nCreated: October 16, 2023\nLabels: #Product-Features, #Liquidity-mining\n\n### Summary\nIntroduce protocol-owned liquidity via sales of SPA bonds using the bond protocol and treasury tokens. \n\n### Overview\nWith SIP-56 the protocol aims to reduce emissions significantly. This could lead to a reduction of incentives for liquidity providers of the SPA/USDs farm. With the current market conditions, it is important to have deeper liquidity for SPA token and not completely rely on non-sticky external liquidity providers.  \n\nHaving protocol-owned liquidity will also allow the protocol to earn from the volatile crypto markets and reinvest the earnings back into the improvement of liquidity for the protocol. Also providing liquidity in a tighter range will allow the protocol to have greater liquidity depth. \n\n### Technical Specifications\n\nSPA tokens will be auctioned using the sequential Dutch auction method, vesting over 7 days and with a maximum discount to the current price of 5%. Maximum USDs purchased in a month will be in the range of 1,000 USDs per month. In case the bond market fails, the discount can be further increased up to a maximum of 10%. \n\nThe USDs tokens will be paired with the required amount of SPA tokens from protocol Treasury to provide liquidity on Uniswap v3 within the tight range of 0.001 USDs/ SPA to 0.006 USDs/ SPA. All fee earnings would either go back to the protocol Treasury or be reinvested into providing liquidity. \n\n### Voting\n\n#### For: \nImplement protocol-owned liquidity\n#### Against: \nDo not implement protocol-owned liquidity",

To achieve these objectives, the team is proposing protocol enhancements:\n\n- Decreasing SPA emissions from Demeter farms by 50% and curbing SPA bribes dispensed by SPA Gauge by 20%.\n- Shifting Demeter emissions to xSPA\n\n### **Motivation**\n- Since the inception of Demeter, the Sperax treasury has emitted over $500K of SPA tokens. The emissions were to contribute towards increasing the overall ecosystem TVL. Although there are various factors affecting the TVL, the total Demeter TVL has dropped by more than 50% in the last 5 months.\n- Presently, SPA inflation remains relatively high, exerting selling pressure. In accordance with [SIP-32](https://snapshot.org/#/speraxdao.eth/proposal/0x02b1043150b2abc2147bf5c7892559d9d88afa23e5765f799131a29c024ffaf6), we aim to reduce inflation in 2023. We offer a 50% overall reduction in Demeter and Gauge emissions.\n\n### **Overview**\nIn 2023, SperaxDAO is committed to reducing unnecessary SPA emissions while simultaneously boosting the circulation of USDs.\n\n- Demeter farms currently emit 414500 SPA tokens per day, while SPA Gauge disburses 383,550 xSPA per week as bribes. The proposed solution involves reducing weekly emissions from the SPA Gauge by 50% and trimming the bribe budget by 20%.\n\nThe new bribe distribution for the farms is as follows:\n* SPA/USDs Camelot - 68186 xSPA/week\n* SPA/USDs Uniswap v3 - 68186 xSPA/week\n * USDs/USDC.e Uniswap v3 - 45357 xSPA/week\n * USDC/USDs Uniswap v3 - 45357 xSPA/week\n * USDs/USDC.e Camelot - 45357 xSPA/week\n * plsSPA/SPA Uniswap V3 - 34093 xSPA/week\n\n### **Technical Specifications**\n\n- To achieve an overall SPA inflation reduction of 50%, the proposal includes reducing SPA emissions from Demeter farms by 50% to 207250 SPA tokens per week.\n- Shifting rewards in Demeter farms to xSPA\n- Reducing bribes by 20% and redistributing it as mentioned in the overview.\n\n### **Voting**\n#### For: \nImplement the proposal to reduce SPA emissions and shift rewards to xSPA\n#### Against: \nDevelop an alternative proposal aimed at reducing inflation and enhancing the utilization of USDs",

      "title": "SIP-55: Diversify USDs collateral strategies and restructure USDs minting and redemption fees",
      "content": "Author: Sperax Core Team\nReference: Sperax [docs](https://docs.sperax.io/)\nCreated: September 21, 2023\nLabels: #Product-Features, #USDs-Parameters, #Yield-Strategies\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Sperax core team proposes:\n\n- Diversification of USDs collateral strategies & automation of new strategy additions\n- Restructuring of USDs minting and redeeming fees and related governing rules\n\n## Motivation\n\nThere have been a lot of constraints with USDs collateral strategies, related fees, and restrictions on specific collateral, among others. Being a liquid token, USDs should provide the freedom to every user to choose their collateral, underlying strategies, and associated risks. With multiple strategies in place, we will also be mitigating risks involved with the collateral and their underlying strategies.\n\nMinting and redeeming fees, associated with USDs, should be dependent upon the collateral composition, market dynamics, and available strategies for any collateral. It should be changed periodically as the governing factors change.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe core team is proposing certain steps to broaden the collateral associated with USDs and its underlying strategies. The strategies currently implemented are very limited and we are facing higher risks in deploying the collateral currently available in the vault. The collateral basket should include USDT, USDC, USDC.e, DAI, LUSD, FRAX & VST. We must have multiple strategies for each collateral to maximize the yield from the safest strategies available. \n\n### USD collateral and underlying strategies\n\nThe core team proposes to introduce the following strategies for the seven collaterals mentioned above with a specific allocation cap.\n\n- **USDC:**\n    - Compound (USDC)\n    - Aave (USDC)\n    \n    Maximum cap of 75% of total USDC collateral for each strategy.\n    \n- **USDC.e:**\n    - Compound (USDC.e)\n    - Stargate (Stargate-LP USDC.e)\n    - Aave (USDC.e)\n    - Curve (FRAX-USDC.E)\n    \n    Maximum cap of 50% of total USDC.e collateral for each strategy.\n    \n- **DAI:**\n    - Aave (DAI)\n    - Radiant V2 (DAI)\n    \n    Maximum cap of 75% of total DAI collateral for each strategy.\n    \n- **USDT:**\n    - Aave (USDT)\n    - Stargate (Stargate-LP USDT)\n    \n    Maximum cap of 75% of total USDT collateral for each strategy.\n    \n- **FRAX:**\n    - Frax (Curve-LP FRAX/VST)\n    - Curve (FRAX-USDC.E)\n    \n    Maximum cap of 75% of total FRAX collateral for each strategy.\n    \n- **LUSD:**\n    - Camelot (LUSD-USDC V2 Pool)\n    - Aave (LUSD).\n    \n    Maximum cap of 75% of total LUSD collateral for each strategy.\n    \n\nWe also propose to make USDs collateral selection, underlying strategy selection, and subsequent implementation a governance-less process. This decision is to counter unexpected market conditions and safeguard the collateral. This will help in the smooth introduction of a variety of strategies catering to different and changing user demands.\n\n### Minting and redeeming fees for USDs\n\nThe applicable fee structures for all seven collaterals are mentioned below\n\n| Token | Minting Fees | Redeeming Fees |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| USDC | 0 | 0.05% |\n| USDC.e | 0 | 0.05% |\n| USDT | 0 | 0.05% |\n| LUSD | 0.01% | 0.01% |\n| DAI | 0.01% | 0.05% |\n| FRAX | 0.1% | 0.01% |\n| VST | 0.1% | 0.01% |\n\nThe fee structure will be reviewed every two weeks and revised, if needed, after careful consideration of all the criteria. The target is to decentralize and automate this mechanism. It will be dealt with in a future SIP.\n\n## Specifications\n\n1. Seven collaterals will be used for USDs which are USDC, USDC.e, USDT, DAI, FRAX, VST, and LUSD.\n2. All the strategies mentioned in the overview will be implemented for USDs collateral.\n3. Collateral selection, strategy selection, and implementation will be a governance-independent process. \n4. Restructure the minting and redeeming fees of USDs for all the collaterals as mentioned in the overview.\n5. Revision of the minting and redeeming fees of USDs for all the collaterals, every two weeks, if warranted by the market dynamics and collateral composition.\n\n## Voting\n\nFor: Approve the proposal\nAgainst: Don't make the changes",

Hence, we plan to launch a new Demeter farm i.e. UDSC/USDs UniswapV3. We propose to add this farm to the SPA Gauge.\n\n## Bribe Reallocation\n\nCurrently, both the USDC.e/USDs farms on Camelot and Uniswap are bribed with 54792.85 SPA tokens each per week. We propose to split the bribe amount i.e. 109585.7 SPA tokens, equally among USDC/USDs UniswapV3, USDC.e/USDs UniswapV3 and USDC.e/USDs CamelotV2.\n\n## Specifications\n1. New farm launch and gauge additions of USDC/USDs UniswapV3.\n2. Reallocation of bribes to equally split it between all the USDC Gauges. Each of USDC/USDs UniswapV3, USDC.e/USDs UniswapV3 and USDC.e/USDs CamelotV2 will be bribed with 36528.56 SPA token every week.\n\n## Voting:\nFor: Launch the USDC-USDs farm and add it to the SPA Gauge, reallocate bribes\nAgainst: Don't launch the farm",

Every week, Gauge emits 2.9 M SPA and veSPA voters are bribed 383K SPA. This SPA should be used more prominently and assertively to drive USDs growth and bring new adoption.\n\n### Motivation\n\nSince the start of SPA Gauge, USDs total supply has decreased from $2M to $1.78M. In the meantime, SPA Gauge has emitted about 80M SPA amounting to $392K. The SPA circulating supply has increased from 1.593B to 1.658B. \n\nEmitting SPA in a predetermined manner and without assessing the market dynamics is improper utilization of resources. Since our target is to increase USDs adoption which will help in growing the Sperax ecosystem and its participants, we must rethink our overall strategy.\n\n### Overview\n\nApart from maintaining the target to make SPA deflationary, SperaxDAO should ensure that the emission is invested back into the ecosystem and contributes directly towards increasing the USDs adoption and supply.\n\nAll SPA emissions should have a looping effect such that a good portion of SPA distributed should be invested back into the ecosystem in the form of veSPA and increase the burning rate of SPA. \nSince the emissions are not helping in increasing either USDs adoption or the locked tokens. The recent increment in veSPA numbers is primarily driven by the team token allocation in veSPA. The Sperax ecosystem is steadily moving towards complete decentralization of protocols and hence should have more governance participation.\n\nThe Sperax ecosystem should have a new reward token. A token which can be staked as veSPA or redeemed for SPA. After drawing some inspiration from the Camelot emission strategy, the core team proposes the launch of a new token called xSPA. Users can either stake 1 xSPA for one veSPA or redeem 1 xSPA for 1 SPA.\n\n### Technical overview\n\nUsers can redeem 1 xSPA token for SPA by depositing their xSPA token through the redemption contract. Users can stake 1 xSPA in veSPA to increase their staked SPA balance. The relation between xSPA, SPA, and veSPA will be governed by the following rules\n\n- 1 xSPA will be equivalent to 1 SPA.\n- Users can redeem 1 xSPA for 1 SPA if they lock the xSPA in the redemption contract for 180 days, the maximum redemption period.\n- Users can redeem 1 xSPA for 0.5 SPA if they lock the xSPA in the redemption contract of 15 days, the minimum redemption period.\n- If the redemption period is ‘x’, between 15 and 180 days, the amount of SPA a user gets is governed by the following equation.\n    - Receivable SPA = [{(x-15)/(180-x)}*0.5 + 0.5]*xSPA\n- A redemption request cannot be modified or canceled.\n- The redemption contract will instantly burn any differential SPA\n    - In case of the minimum locking period of 15 days, half the SPA tokens will be burnt right away and users can claim their SPA tokens after 15 days.\n    - In case of a maximum locking period of 180 days, no SPA will be burnt and users can claim their SPA token after 180 days.\n    - In case of a period between 15 and 180 days, SPA burnt will be xSPA*[0.5 - {(x-15)/(180-x)}*0.5] and users can claim their SPA tokens after ‘x’ days.\n- Users can stake 1 xSPA token in the veSPA contract to increase their staked SPA balance by 1 SPA token for the existing lockup period if the lockup period is greater than 180 days.\n    - If the user has 0 staked balance, the system will throw an error and will ask the user to create a staked position with a minimum staking period of 180 days\n    - If the user has staked balance but the lockup is less than 180 days, the system will throw an error and ask the user to increase the locking period to a minimum of 180 days\n    - Users will be able to increase their staked position if the lockup period is above 180 days.\n- xSPA token will be transferrable.\n- The staking and redemption criteria can be updated/modified through governance.\n\n### Voting\n#### For\nLaunch new xSPA token as per mentioned specifications\n\n#### Against\nContinue as it is without the new token",

      "title": "SIP-52: USDs smart contract upgrade (USDs V2)",
      "content": "Author: Sperax Core Team\nReference: current [docs](https://docs.sperax.io/)\nCreated: July 26, 2023\nLabels: #Product-Features, #USDs-parameters\n\n## Simple Summary / Motivation\n\nSperax is upgrading its Smart contract architecture to further decentralize the protocol. The key idea behind the decentralization of the protocol is to make it completely transparent and open to all users to run the protocol. We are still deliberating on features that will be upgradeable via protocol governance and features that will be governance-free. Making some features governance-free will allow for more transparency and faith amongst developers building on top of the Sperax USD protocol. Even the protocol functionalities that need a governance proposal to undergo change will be implemented via a timelock so that the participants of the protocol will have sufficient time to change their behavior or interaction with the protocol if they are unhappy with the proposed changes.\n\n## Overview / Technical Specification\n\n#### Major protocol improvements in USDs smart contract (USDs version 2)\n\nThe Smart contract architecture is been upgraded to decentralize certain functionalities which were earlier available to the admin only. Some of the functionalities which will be decentralized are:\n\n* Depositing and withdrawing collateral from yield strategies\n* Harvesting yield-farmed tokens from yield strategies\n* Exchanging harvested yield tokens for USDs\n* Introducing a new dripper contract\n* Distribution of auto-yield to all eligible addresses\n\nApart from the above upgrades, we will also be upgrading the redemption functionality to allow redeemers to redeem from a certain yield strategy to provide more flexibility to redeemers.\n\nIn a future upgrade, we will introduce a view function to help redeemers view the slippage at the yield strategy level.\n\n![0f8ca331-4f7c-4835-b080-4531c5698861_1336x1004.jpg](ipfs://bafybeifszlxmpxlml3mwi7sqx3stq3dckjzdbrl55djqbwwathcsmailym)\n    \n\n\n#### Introducing Dripper contract and changes to Auto-Yield\n\nThe dripper contract controls the rate of release of USDs for rebase. All USDs bought back from the market will be deposited in a new “Dripper” contract. This contract will gradually release USDs which can be distributed as auto-yield to USDs holders if certain conditions are met. The initial release rate is set to (Dripper USDs balance / 7 days), i.e. every USD deposited in Dripper will be released gradually at a constant rate per second over the next 7 days.\n\nConditions when someone can call the function to distribute auto-yield:\n\n1. Distribute the auto-yield after at least three days since the last distribution.\n2. Distribute the auto-yield only if the APR achieved through the distribution is greater than 3%.\n3. Cap maximum APR for auto-yield at 10%. Store in the contract for future distributions any extra yield generated over 10%.\n\n\n## Voting\n#### For:\nUpgrade USDs smart contract to Version 2 (USDs V2)\n\n#### Against\nDon’t upgrade the smart contract",

      "content": "Author: Sperax Core Team\nReference: [Liquity](https://www.liquity.org/), [Camelot exchange](https://camelot.exchange), [Ramses exchange](https://app.ramses.exchange/liquidity), [Chronos exchange](https://app.chronos.exchange/liquidity)\nCreated: July 10, 2023\nLabels: #New-Assets, #Yield-Strategies\n\n## Simple Summary\nDecentralization is the key priority for Sperax.\n\nThe major stablecoins whitelisted as USDs collateral - USDC and USDT - are not fully decentralized. Thus, the Team offers to add to the collateral basket a decentralized stablecoin - Liquity USD (LUSD) that would be used on new yield strategies.\n\n## Motivation\nCurrently, the following tokens are whitelisted as USDs collateral: USDC, USDT, FRAX, DAI, and VST.\n\nThough, USDT, USDC, FRAX, and DAI  can’t be considered fully decentralized.\n\nTo improve the decentralization of USDs, we offer to include a decentralized stablecoin Liquity LUSD (LUSD) in the collateral basket. This addition will make the USDs collateral basket more decentralized and make it possible to add newer more profitable yield strategies to generate yield for USDs and veSPA holders.\n\n## Overview\n[Liquity USD](https://www.liquity.org/) (LUSD) with a market cap of $278M is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows users to draw interest-free loans against Ether (ETH) which is used as collateral (CDP - collateralized debt position).\n\nLiquity Stablecoin (LUSD) is the native stablecoin of the Liquity protocol. It is designed to maintain its peg to the US dollar through a mechanism that adjusts the supply of LUSD based on market demand.\n\nThough LUSD belongs to the category of “algorithmic stablecoins” - its design is cardinally safer than notorious Terra’s stablecoin UST. UST was collateralized by its governance and value accrual token LUNA (which made the death spiral possible).\n\nOn the contrary, LUSD is not collateralized by its value accrual token LQTY. LUSD is overcollateralized by ETH (minimal collateralization rate is 110%) and ETH is the second most trustful crypto asset after BTC.\n\nTo generate a yield for USDs and veSPA holders, LUSD can be used for yield strategies. For example, when paired with USDC or USDT, it can earn middle-to-high single digits or low double-digits on non-concentrated liquidity pools like Camelot Exchange (V2) or Ramses Exchange (V1 pools), or Chronos Exchange, and double-digit APR (concentrated liquidity pools) on Ramses Exchange.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\n* Whitelist LUSD as collateral\n* Swap a portion of collateral for LUSD\n* Deploy LUSD in the yield strategies\n\n## Voting\n#### For:\n\nWhitelist LUSD (Liquity USD), swap a part of current collateral for LUSD, and deploy LUSD in yield strategies.\n\n#### Against\nDon’t whitelist LUSD",

      "title": "SIP-49: SafeYields <> Sperax Strategic Alignment",
      "content": "**Author(s):** [SafeYields Team](https://twitter.com/SafeYields)\n**Reference**: SafeYields' [Whitepaper](https://safeyields.io/safeyields_whitepaper.pdf), [Medium](https://safeyields.medium.com), [Site](https://safeyields.io), [dApp](https://app.safeyields.io)\n**Created:** June 7th, 2023.\n**Labels** #New-Assets, #Product-Features \n\n## Abstract\n\nWith market volatility comes the opportunity for great profits on one hand and also losses on the other, the need for hedging against it should be paramount for an investor’s portfolio.\n\nSafeYields developed the SAFE token (collateralized by USDC) which is mathematically designed to keep positive price action regardless of market conditions, the protocol also developed a second token called SAFE+ (collateralized by USDs) that scales the hedge of SAFE with the compounding benefits of USDs.\n\nSafeYields proposes to the Sperax protocol the creation of a single token farm for SAFE+ which would require whitelisting the compounding rewards of USDs into SAFE+’s contract and require SPA emissions for investors who vest SAFE+ for a period of time. \nFurthermore, we are requesting a SPA gauge for this pool. .\n\nThe above will lock large amounts of USDs within SAFE+ while offering a new hedging product to the arbitrum community. .\n\n## Introduction\n\nWith not only market volatility but uncertainty of crypto stable assets comes the need to hedge against them; the SafeYields protocol brings just that.\n\nThe most incisive solutions are oftentimes born from catastrophic failure. The past market cycle has revealed some spectacular implosions caused by faulty tokenomic design. \nAlgorithmic stablecoins like $UST, node projects like $STRONG and rebase protocols like Olympus DAO were instrumental in pointing us towards our north star as they proved to be masterclasses on which pitfalls to avoid, when building towards the vision of a robust and sustainable protocol.\n\nThese are the set of problems we have learned from, innovated upon, and overcome when building SafeYields:\n\n1. The inflationary token emissions of rebase DAOs.\n2. Death Spirals brought about by Algorithmic Stablecoins.\n\nThe convergence of these solutions results in the creation of the SAFE Ecosystem on the Arbitrum Blockchain. $SAFE tokens which mathematically cannot go down in value and are resistant to bank runs and death spirals.\n\n## Scope\n\n$SAFE+ is 100% collateralized by $USDs and its unique architecture makes it mathematically impossible to drop in price. \nWhen trading $SAFE+ investors are taxed 0.25% on buys and 0.45% on sells (0.2% used to redeem USDs). Additionally, $SAFE+ is minted when bought and burned when sold. Part of the 0.25% tax is used to buy USDs and stays in the USDs Vault which acts as over collateral, raising the price over time from either buying or selling. \nIn other words, there will always be more $USDs in the Vault than $SAFE+ tokens in circulation.\n\nBut what happens when here is no volume? \nThe SAFE ecosystem is bootstrapping a treasury through the sale of NFTs (that act as shares of the protocol), which is invested and allocates 5% of rewards to buy USDs and inject directly into the Vault, that in turn, acts as over collateral for SAFE+, further raising its price over time regardless of market volume.\n\n## Methodology\n\n**SAFE+ Token**\n\nIn order to keep SAFE+ price action in check, the token cannot be listed in any DEX or be part of an LP, since the SAFE+/USDs Vault is the only trading party, SafeYields is able to apply the following formula exclusively:\n\n![Sperax5.png](ipfs://QmUc6kBbjLEP92kf7o4BVXm9gEAgfNtB5sad4zzX8LECJv)\n    \n\n\n\n**SAFE+ single staking farm**\n\nSAFE+’s unique architecture doesn’t allow for an LP listing, therefore we propose a single staking farm in partnership with the Sperax protocol.\n\nThis would result in SPA emissions and further listing on the Sperax Dapp for bribes.\n\n## Discussion & Conclusions\n\nThe SAFE+ token - as shown before - may act as a true hedge on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Furthermore, it uses USDs as collateral which can be compounded and increase USDs circulating supply. .\n\nAccepting the creation of a single staking farm for SAFE+ and the addition of a SPA gauge would bring both SAFE and the Sperax communities the opportunity to scale its volume and consequently USDs’, meaning more value locked into Sperax and more SPA burns. \nBribes from SY allows investors to scale rewards within the Sperax ecosystem, for SAFE it means a deepened Vault value (collateralized by USDs), SAFE also has an interest in governance, therefore it would use the rewards from bribes not only to benefit SAFE/Sperax holders, but also participate in future governance through SPA staking.\n\n## Technical Specifications\nNot available\n\n## Voting\n#### For:\nCreation of a SAFE+ single staking vault (SPA emissions) and eligible for bribes.\n\n#### Against:\nNo action",

      "content": "Author: Sperax Core Team\nReference: [SIP-1](https://snapshot.org/#/speraxdao.eth/proposal/0xf511758f47cf5b8b93905d99a33c0d307cb52a4cce07b00dc699a06fb0e8b397), [SIP-2](https://snapshot.org/#/speraxdao.eth/proposal/0x18baf013f216228bb9090e00649b26158fc7f4527b179d32d2428d5f9cfd2b28), [Sperax docs](https://docs.sperax.io).\nCreated: June 7, 2023\nLabels: # USDs-Parameters, # Yield-Strategies,\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe team proposes to reintroduce USDT as a part of the USDs collateral basket and deposit it to Camelot USDT-USDC strategy that would generate USDs protocol yield for USDs holders and SPA stakers.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently, USDs is overdependent on USDC and Frax.\nDespite two other collaterals (DAI, VST) being whitelisted - none of them is present in the collateral basket. This limits the selection of strategies that can be used to generate the protocol yield.\n\n## Overview\n\nSince the last summer, USDT was not used as collateral in yield strategies in order to mitigate potential risks, as defined by [SIP-1](https://snapshot.org/#/speraxdao.eth/proposal/0xf511758f47cf5b8b93905d99a33c0d307cb52a4cce07b00dc699a06fb0e8b397). USDT collateral has been replaced with VST and Frax which at that moment offered better yield opportunities. Also, DAI collateral/strategy was added with [SIP-2](https://snapshot.org/#/speraxdao.eth/proposal/0x18baf013f216228bb9090e00649b26158fc7f4527b179d32d2428d5f9cfd2b28).\n\nWe saw that USDC collateral was exposed to depeg risks while USDT held its peg well. USDT stays the most used stablecoin with various yield opportunities.\n\nNow the Team offers to reintroduce USDT as collateral and employ it in delta-neutral strategies - starting with Camelot USDT-USDC.\n\nThe reintroduction of USDT will bring the following benefits:\n\n* USDT is the most popular stablecoin. The reintroduction of USDT as collateral would attract USDT users who will be able to mint/swap USDT for USDs directly;\n\n* A part of the collateral will be swapped into USDT with the aim of diversifying collateral distribution;\n\n* USDT will be deposited in the pair with USDC to Camelot's USDT-USDC strategy. This would generate APR in the 4.8% to 8% (depending on the selected xGrail redemption time).\n\n*  Potentially, USDT can also be used in other yield strategies on Arbitrum.\n\nThis proposal would mitigate the following concerns:\n\na) The revealed USDC risks\n\nIn March 2023 it became obvious that USDC - the primary collateral of USDs (~67%) - is not protected against depeg and centralization risks. According to [Circle](https://twitter.com/circle/status/1634391505988206592), $3.3 bln (~8% of USDC reserves) were exposed to the failed Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). USDC depegged to [$0.87](https://decrypt.co/123211/usdc-stablecoin-depegs-90-cents-circle-exposure-silicon-valley-bank). Despite the peg to $1 has been recovered, USDC continues to lose its market cap while USDT regains its ATH market cap figures (Glassnode chart).\n\n \n![Glassnode mcap.jpg](ipfs://bafkreih3fiorkj3wwanm6locj4tyw5mweg7qwgrmr3as4emtmkw3xnxgoe)\n    \nThe market cap of USDC has fallen to $28.9B (the level of Sep 2021) which is ~35% of the USDT market cap that just has reached ATH - $83.4B\n\nb) Limited portfolio of strategies, no yield from VST and DAI strategies\n\nCurrently, only two strategies generate yield - Stargate-USDC and Saddle Frax-USDC.\n\nVST and DAI collateral played their parts mainly in Q3-Q4 2022 being employed in Curve-LP FRAX/VST and Aave: DAI strategies.\n\nThough, from today's perspective, these strategies can’t be used anymore: the shares of VST and DAI in the USDs collateral basket are close to zero.\n\n#### Technical Specification\n\n* Swap a portion of collateral with USDT with minimum slippage\n\n* Create and deposit Camelot spNFT position to Camelot USDT-USDC pool, use Grail and xGrail earned for SPA buyback and USDs Auto-yield in accordance to the [Sperax docs](https://docs.sperax.io).\n\n## Voting\n#### For:\nReintroduce USDT collateral and employ it in Camelot USDT-USDC strategy\n#### Against\nDon’t reintroduce USDT or diversify the current basket of strategies",

The Sperax team offers to connect them to the Sperax Gauge and reallocate bribes across the pools.\n\n## Overview\nAfter the successful integration of the Sperax Demeter Gauge and Bribes with UniswapV3, the Sperax DAO will launch two key liquidity pools on Camelot - SPA-USDs and USDC-USDs. To be eligible for a Chainlink oracle Sperax protocol needs to create deep liquidity for SPA across at least 3 DEXs. Being built on top of the Camelot mechanism, Sperax Demeter farms will prioritize long-term liquidity mining over mercenary capital. The total value locked in these two farms will be meaningful for overall Sperax TVL, driving revenue to Sperax USD protocol and SPA stakers.\n\n## Technical Specification\n* Add SPA/USDs and USDs/USDC farms to the SPA Gauge on Camelot\n* Add bribes to the farms from the current Bribe budget\n\n## Voting\n\n#### For\nAdd SPA/USDs and USDs/USDC Camelot farms (when they launch) to the SPA Gauge and add bribes. \n#### Against\nDon’t add the farms to the Gauge",

Now that Arbitrum is the most popular and one of the highest used layer 2 chains, it’s important that we take steps to move the stuck SPA balances from Ethereum to Arbitrum.\n\nveSPA holders on Arbitrum are able to benefit from the weekly SPA revenue share that comes from Sperax USD as well as the bribes that are being distributed to the veSPA holders.\n\n## Technical Specification\nWallets having veSPA balances only on Ethereum will be migrated to Arbitrum. Those wallets which have veSPA balances in the residual period or for which veSPA balances are expiring in 7 days or already expired will be locked on Arbitrum for 7 days with auto-cooldown turned on.\n\nFor wallets that have veSPA balances on both Ethereum and Arbitrum, the SPA token balances will be added to their staked veSPA balances in Arbitrum. The lockup expiry period will be maximum of their lockup period on Ethereum and Arbitrum.\n\n## Voting\n#### For\nMove veSPA from Ethereum to Arbitrum with the proposed technical specifications\n\n#### Against\nDevelop alternative technical specifications",

Now that Arbitrum is the most popular and one of the highest used layer 2 chain, it’s important that we take steps to move the stuck SPA balances from Ethereum to Arbitrum.\n\nveSPA holders on Arbitrum are able to benefit from the weekly SPA revenue share that comes from Sperax USD as well as the bribes that are being distributed to the veSPA holders.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\n* Wallets having veSPA balances only on Ethereum will be migrated to Arbitrum. Those wallets which have veSPA balances in the residual period or for which veSPA balances are expiring in 7 days or already expired will be locked on Arbitrum for 7 days with auto-cooldown turned on.\n\n* For wallets that have veSPA balances on both Ethereum and Arbitrum, the SPA token balances will be added to their staked veSPA balances in Arbitrum.

      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Team\nCreated: March 27, 2023\nLabels: #Product Features\n\n## Simple Summary / Abstract\nUpdate the policy for addition of farms to the Sperax gauge. All farms that wish to receive Sperax tokens through the gauge will have to go through the current governance process to get listed on the Sperax gauge. Empower the current sperax team to remove a farm from the rewarder and gauge if the proportion of USDs or SPA as a percentage of overall TVL for the farm is less than 20%.\n\n## Motivation\nSperax gauge and rewarder was meant to be a permissionless process which allows for a fair reward allocation process. But currently the process is highly susceptible to getting spammed since it’s easy for anyone with little to no resources to create a Demeter farm and push the team to add it to the gauge. While every other gauge, including Curve and Frax have a governance check in place to add farms to the gauge it was not considered initially for the Sperax gauge to keep the process simple. However it has come to notice that users are trying to create tokens just for the sake of farming SPA tokens through the SPA gauge and rewarder. If this is left unchecked it would cause a lot of pain for real LPs and protocols. Demeter should still remain permissionless and allow all users to be able to create farms, but which farms among them should be added to the SPA gauge should be decided by veSPA holders through governance.\n\nAnother issue that has come to light is that some farms are not successful in attracting TVL for USDs. And in some cases some of the Demeter farms go out of range such that the LP positions that are in the farm mostly consist of one single token. These farms are not providing any value to the Sperax ecosystem and the current administrations for the gauge should be allowed to remove these farms from the gauge. However once these farms are back in range they should be added back to the gauge without the need for a governance proposal.\n\n## Specification\nAll Farms that are added to the Sperax Gauge have to pass through the Sperax governance process\nFarms which are out of range or have less than 20% of their TVL component in the form of USDs or SPA can be removed from the Sperax gauge and rewarder by the admin multisig holders\nFarms which are out of range and come back into the range can be added back to the Sperax gauge and rewarder by the admin multisig holders\n\n## Voting\n### For: \nUpdate policy to add Demeter farms to the Sperax Gauge and rewarder\n\n### Against: \nDon't update the policy",

      "title": "SIP-38: Introduce Mint Fee for VST and restart minting USDs with VST",
      "content": "Title: Introduce Mint Fee for VST and restart minting USDs with VST\nAuthor(s): Core Team\nCreated: 03/27/23\nLabels: #USDs parameters\n\n## Simple Summary / Abstract\n\nAllow users to mint USDs with VST again. VST has recently proved that it can hold its peg. While allowing users to mint USDs with VST it is important to safeguard the Sperax protocol from concentration risks associated with one single collateral token. To prevent concentration risk from VST, minting with VST will accrue a small fee of 0.2% and minting with VST will be paused whenever the proportion of VST balance as a percentage of total USDs supply exceeds 30%. When VST balance as a percentage of total supply goes above 30%, there wouldn’t be any requirement for a governance proposal to restart minting with VST.\n\n## Motivation\nDuring the USDC depeg event on the weekend of March 11th and March 12th, VST among all other stablecoins also depegged. But due it’s pure CDP nature the crypto community regained its trust and confidence in the product. This trend was seen across the industry with other pure CDP stablecons in the ecosystem such as LUSD and Synthetic USD. It is beyond the scope of this proposal to discuss the risks associated with various stablecoin types. But right now USDs is over reliant on fiat backed stablecoin USDC, which is not ideal. Given that the overall crypto community is looking to diversify into various kinds of stablecoins, Sperax protocol should also take steps to diversify the basket of stablecoins.\n\n![Screenshot 2023-03-27 at 5.56.47 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreicbm4prqtrvgvktvgyoe22nfe56njntmxigdocuzhsawc6rfhmb6e)\n    \nSource: [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/vesta-stable)\n\nAlso with the launch of the Vesta Reference Rate, the VST has been able to better manage the demand and supply for VST thus ensuring that VST holds its peg.\n\nThere are certain concerns associated with VST. Although the peg holds, VST doesn’t have very deep liquidity, so it would not be very easy for the Sperax protocol to get out of the VST position if it deemed necessary. VST has no direct liquidity against USDC, this was one of the major reasons why Sperax protocol was used to exchange VST for USDC. Given that Sperax USD (USDs) has deep liquidity against USDC it is possible that history might repeat itself if we don’t adjust some of the parameters. .\n\n![Screenshot 2023-03-27 at 5.57.05 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreig4jz3evjqwnel64kmhhpu72utso5wbd6iwsjlqevyovaeljver3y)\n    \nSource: [Sperax Analytics Page TVL chart ](https://app.sperax.io/analytics)\n\nIn the above chart we can see how users exchanged VST (light green color) for USDC (deep blue color) which started around September 19th. This started when VST allowed users to mint VST with GLP. On chain data suggests that users minted VST with GLP and then used the sperax protocol to convert VST to USDC and then loop into GLP again and again. Sperax protocol acted as one of the cheapest venues for users to exchange VST for USDC. This impacted the collateral concentration risk for the protocol as VST depegged. To prevent this Sperax protocol should take two measures.\n\n1. Introduce a small fee for minting with VST to make sure there’s a small disincentive for users looking to redeem USDC while minting with VST.\n2.

The token is a governance token to manage the Arbitrum DAO an the community allocation for grants across the ARB ecosystem.  \n\n[Summoner DAO](https://summonerdao.org) is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on curating investment discussions in the web3 ecosystem. It aims to bring together a community of experienced investors, industry experts, and thought leaders to share insights and analysis on promising investment opportunities in web3 with a focus on the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently the SperaxDAO will be allocated a specific amount of tokens, and as a core stablecoin protocol, will only be able to allocate so many resources towards voting.  Therefore it makes sense for Sperax to delegate a meaningful share of governance share to a third party which will vote in the interests of Sperax.\n\n## Overview\n\nAs a delegate of Sperax, Summoner DAO agrees to vote in an aligned manner with the DAO, pursue grants that bring greater activity to DeFi on Arbitrum, and encourage treasury diversification to USDs whenever possible as treasury diversification of stable coins is essential to a healthy DAO treasury.  The DAO exists in the DeFi space, and has been members of the Sperax community for some time.  \n\n## Technical Specification\n\nDelegate 500,000 ARB to SummonerDAO.eth immediately, and delegate the remaining ARB tokens held by the treasury no later after 90 days should the DAO find no issue with its current delegation.\n\n\n## Voting\n\n### For:\nDelegate 500,000 ARB to Summoner DAO\n\n### Against:\nDon't delegate",

      "title": "SIP-36: Update redemption policy",
      "content": "Author: Core Team\nReference: None\nCreated: March, 13th, 2023\nLabels: #USDs Parameters, #Product Features\n\n## Summary\nSperax protocol design doesn’t take into account the possibility of its underlying collaterals depegging significantly and as a result making the protocol undercollateralized in events where the underlying collateral tokens significantly depegged. To prevent this the USDs holders and the Sperax community should undertake the risks associated with the depegging of the underlying collateral. One unit of USDs should be made redeemable against any one unit of the other stablecoin which has been whitelisted to be accepted as collateral.\n\n## Overview\nThe event of USDC depegging was not factored into by the Sperax team and community in the current design of the Sperax protocol. USDs holders saw an opportunity to redeem USDs for USDC and receive multiple units of USDC per unit of USDs. This of course helped USDs maintain the peg for a longer period of time, but as a result the protocol became slightly undercollateralized.\n\nInitially Sperax USD was set up as an algorithmic stablecoin which always allowed for 1:1 redemptions in USD value. When the protocol changed to a 100% collateralized model it retained this feature and the community and team didn’t anticipate a significant depegging of USDC. Although the community saw risks in other centralized stablecoins like USDT, stablecoin peg for Frax and USDC were never questioned.\n\nThe team also didn’t obstruct or pause redemptions since it believed in executing important protocol changes through governance. But redemptions automatically stopped once the balance of USDC in the Stargate strategy and vault became 0. The protocol was initially only designed to accommodate one redemption strategy per token. Although the community addresses changing the default investment strategy for USDC from Stargate to Saddle via SIP 27, the default redemption strategy was not changed. In future we will bring the ability for users to redeem from specific strategies. While the protocol’s redemption mechanism remained unpaused it lost some collateral, currently the collateralization stands at around 98.92%. The small losses that the protocol made in collateral ratio would be compensated with treasury funds and yield reserve. As per the protocol’s framework SPA tokens should be used to buy back USDs from the market and be burnt but the proposal is to use some of the pending Demeter fee collected, Sperax team’s funds and some of the auto-yield reserve to mitigate the small loss.\n\nUSDs cannot behave as a fully pegged stablecoin when the underlying stablecoins have depegged. In light of the current situation, it is important to make some changes to the redemption policy to prevent a recurrence of a similar event. Redemptions should remain paused till this new update is implemented. The USDs holders collectively should agree on which collaterals they wish to undertake the risk of price depegs. As of this time, all the current whitelisted collaterals USDC, Frax and Dai have regained their peg and are probably still more trustworthy than others. We leave it to the community to bring in proposals to update the collateral composition.\n\nGiven that USDs will be in future treated as being pegged to the underlying stablecoins instead of to the USD directly, one unit of USDs should become redeemable for one unit of USDC/ DAI/ Frax or any future whitelisted collateral.\n\n## Technical Specifications\nUpdate the vault core tools contract to allow one unit of USDs to be redeemable for a maximum of one unit of any underlying collateral (USDC, FRAX, DAI) based on the price of the collateral. If the price of a collateral is 0.98 then 1 unit of USDs can be redeemed for 1 unit of the collateral. If by some unforeseen event the price of a unit of collateral becomes more than 1 USD then 1 USDs will be redeemable for 1 USD value of that collateral.\n\n## Voting\n### For:\nApprove new redemption policy and allow Auto-Yield reserve and Demeter Fee collected so far to be used for covering the gap in collateralization.\n\n### Against:\nReject the changes to redemption policy and start redemptions",

      "title": "SIP-35: Decentralize and streamline staking reward distribution",
      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Team\nReference: [Staking protocol doc](https://docs.sperax.io/staking-protocol), [SIP-33](https://snapshot.org/#/speraxdao.eth/proposal/0xf4c19cef7f1cb44e91e21c04c877d9389ad5391869669f3da11b8ae152c7ea2b)\nCreated: March, 1st, 2023\nLabels: #Product Features\n\n## Simple Summary / Abstract\nStaking rewards are generated by the SperaxUSD protocol only on Arbitrum (L2) network. SPA staking functionality is currently present both on Arbitrum and Ethereum, at the same time, the majority of staked SPA (95%+) and staking wallets (99%+) live on Arbitrum.\nThe process of transferring staking rewards generated by the SperaxUSD protocol on Arbitrum to stakers on Ethereum and the equalization of fixed-rate rewards (Incentive Rewards) on the two chains is currently centralized and requires manual intervention. To optimize this process, the Sperax team intends to decentralize and streamline staking rewards distribution.\n\nThe stakers on Ethereum will get the option to move their veSPA balances from Ethereum to Arbitrum, keeping all the staking parameters (veSPA balance, lockup duration) unchanged. The Yield Share rewards and the Fee rewards will be distributed on Arbitrum only and not transferred to Ethereum. Until the team builds the contract for Ethereum stakers to transfer their veSPA balances from Ethereum to Arbitrum the veSPA stakers on Ethereum shall receive a fixed yield at the rate of 7200 SPA tokens per week which would make the staking APR equal to 3.2% - taking into account emissions redirections as foreseen by SIP-33. Staking more SPA on Layer 1 would be paused once this proposal passes.    \n\n## Motivation\n- Currently, SPA can be staked both on Arbitrum and Ethereum, though there is a huge difference in the amounts staked on both networks. A significant share of staked SPA (95.3%) and staking wallets (99.7%) live on Arbitrum, and only a tiny part - on Ethereum (4.7% and 0.3%, respectively).\n\n- The rewards are generated by Sperax USD protocol on Arbitrum only. The process of transferring rewards from Arbitrum to the stakers on Ethereum stays centralized and requires manual intervention, as well as the process of equalization of fixed-rate rewards distributed to the stakers on both networks. \n\n## Overview\nWith the purpose of its quick adoption, the staking protocol has been launched both on Ethereum (L1) and Arbitrum (L2). Its rewards have their origin on Arbitrum - their source is USDs protocol yield (Yield Share rewards) and mint/redeem fees (Fee Rewards), supported by fixed-rate rewards (Incentive Rewards) sponsored by Treasury. A part of all rewards is partially transferred to the stakers on Ethereum and this transfer is a centralized and manual task.\n\nCurrently, ~233M SPA is locked on both networks for more than 3 years on average which is an equivalent of ~728M veSPA.\n\nHowever, the major amount of staked SPA (95.3%) and staking wallets (99.7%) live on Arbitrum.\nThus, the proposal is: to make it possible for veSPA stakers to move their veSPA balances from Ethereum to Arbitrum.  \n\nAll the stakers on Arbitrum (including those who will transfer their veSPA balances from Ethereum) will continue getting all the rewards: Yield Share Rewards, Fee Rewards, and L2 incentive rewards (if any) apart from benefiting from the bribe and other rewards.  If a user decides not to move the veSPA balance to Arbitrum, even after the option to transfer the balances have been provided they will not earn any rewards. \n\nUntil a contract and mechanism are built to transfer the rewards from L1 to L2, the veSPA holders on L1 shall receive fixed rewards per week at the rate of 7200 SPA tokens per week which would make their current APR on L1 to be equal to 3.2% if no more tokens are staked on L1.\n\nThis will defragment, streamline and decentralize rewards distribution as there will be no need to move rewards cross-chain in a centralized way. Also, it will help users to optimize network fees for staking/claiming/restaking given the transaction fees of Arbitrum are 10-20x less than on Ethereum. \n\n#### Calculation of fixed rewards on L1\n\n- Fixed rate  *(does not include SIP-33 provisions)*\nFor the fixed rate calculation the average of the 5 most recent SPA distributions on Ethereum is taken as a reference: 26.4k SPA weekly.\n\n- Fixed rate *(after alignment with SIP-33)*\nAs per SIP-33: 383,550k SPA (total additional weekly emission) will be redirected from veSPA emissions to bribe veSPA holders. This means that once SIP-33 is implemented on Arbitrum - the share of this total emission on Ethereum (proportional to staking on Ethereum) must be deducted from the above-mentioned Fixed rate (which didn’t include SIP-33 provisions).\n~5% of total staked SPA/veSPA lives on Ethereum and the proportional share of additional rewards on Ethereum is 5% of 383,550k SPA which gives a fixed rate after SIP-33 implementation equal to 7.2k SPA (this means APR 3.2%):\n`26.4k (fixed rate without SIP-33 provisions) - 19.2k (5%x383.5k) = 7.2k SPA (fixed rate after alignment with SIP-33)`\n\n## Technical Specification\nSet up the functionality that will allow users to move their veSPA balances from L1 to the same account (wallet) on L2.\nUntil veSPA stakers on L1 are able to transfer the balances, given that SIP-33 is implemented, - distribute 7200 SPA fixed rewards per week for L1 stakers. Pause staking of more SPA tokens on L1. \n\nYield Share Rewards generated by USDs protocol and Fee Rewards will be distributed to L2 accounts only, the rewards will not be transferred to L1. \nThe details of the migration mechanism will be further shared in a separate post and SIP. For wallets that do not have any tokens staked on L2, the migration should be relatively simple. All the parameters of the veSPA balances will be retained within the limitations of the technology. For wallets that have balances, some logic may be required to ascertain the lockup period associated with the new total balances.\n\n## Voting\n#### For: \nSupport decentralization of staking reward distribution and the pausing of staking SPA tokens on L1 \n\n#### Against: \nKeep the current model of staking and rewards distribution on Arbitrum and Ethereum",

      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Team\nReference: Sperax Roadmap 2023\nCreated: February 14th, 2023\nLabels: Product Features\n\n## Simple Summary\nSperax Gauge directs SPA rewards (and thus APR) to liquidity providers of Demeter farms in accordance to the voting of veSPA holders bribed by various protocols/DAOs that launched those farms.\n\n## Motivation\nImplementation of Sperax Gauge will bring an additional value to veSPA holders and liquidity providers on Demeter farms by triggering a market competition of protocols/DAOs that have farms on Demeter. The protocols will bribe veSPA holders with the protocols’ tokens to encourage them to vote for directing SPA rewards to specific farms.\n\n## Overview\nSperax Gauge will incentivise liquidity providers in an automated way based on competitive voting of veSPA holders for the various farms where SPA rewards will be directed to.\n\nSperax Gauge encourages various protocols/DAOs to provide liquidity on DEXs pairing their tokens with USDs. There will be not just currently active Uniswap v3 farms as Demeter will expand to other UniV2-style DEXs such as Sushi, Balancer, TraderJoe, Saddle, Camelot and others.\n\nSperax Gauge will allocate SPA rewards to those pools.\n\nWhen a protocol/DAO launches a farm on Demeter pairing their token with USDs, it makes the farm auto-approved and listed on Sperax Gauge.\n\nAny protocol can bribe veSPA holders with the protocol’s tokens encouraging veSPA holders to drive SPA emissions towards that protocol’s farm, increasing the farm’s APR. The voting happens on a weekly base.\n\nThe bribe will be distributed to the veSPA holders who voted for the farm - proportionally to the share of veSPA they hold.\n\n## Technical Specification\nThe Sperax Gauge is based on three key smart contracts:\n\n1) Gauge Controller contract\n\nKeeps the track of all the registered farms and the user votes for them.\nGaugeController also tracks the bribe contract for a gauge.\nAny farm created via demeter and paired with SPA-USDs will be registered to the GaugeController by default.\nAny user with a veSPA balance > 0, lock-expiry > start of next-cycle will be eligible to use their veSPA to vote on one / multiple gauges. Else the user needs to create a new stake position.\nveSPA holder with manual-cooldown and in residual period is not eligible to cast vote.

      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Team\nReference: n/a\nCreated: January 28th, 2023 (Updated Jan 31, 2023)\nLabels: Product-Features, Governance-Discussion\n\n## Simple Summary\nIn 2023, SperaxDAO must reduce SPA emissions and increase SPA burn. This can only be done by reducing unnecessary SPA emissions and increasing USDs circulating supply. Redirecting SPA paid directly to veSPA stakers to be instead used to bribe stakers is under consideration. Such a move will still deliver SPA to veSPA holders and will also solve liquidity needs for important Sperax pools. \n\n## Abstract\nEvery week, 383,550 SPA are distributed across SPA stakers. This SPA is sponsored by SperaxDAO treasury and doesn’t directly incentivize USDs circulating supply growth, the revenue driver of our ecosystem. \n\n## Motivation\nEliminating SPA emissions that don’t directly increase USDs circulating supply will reduce SPA sell pressure and eliminate a source of SPA emissions without decreasing the circulating supply of USDs and revenue of the protocol.\n\nEnsure SPA/USDs, USDC/USDs and eventually plsSPA/SPA receive adequate emissions while  veSPA stakers receive healthy SPA rewards from bribes. \n\n## Overview\nOver the course of 2023, SperaxDAO has the opportunity to make SPA deflationary. To do this, SPA burned from the USDs revenue share + redemption fees must outweigh the new SPA entering the market. The SPA subsidy for veSPA doesn’t directly correspond to USDs circulating supply increase, so this should be eliminated to help achieve SPA deflation.\n\nThis SPA will be retained by the SperaxDAO treasury for bribing the upcoming SPA Gauge. The gauge will pay SPA to USDs trading pairs. This mechanism is designed to increase USDs circulating supply, increase DAO revenue and quantity of SPA burned.\n\nThis means that the 383,550 SPA that was once sell pressure, can be converted into bribe revenue for veSPA holders and increase USDs circulating supply.\n\n## Technical Specification\nStop SPA emissions of 383,550 SPA / week paid to veSPA stakers.\nBribe veSPA voters with the 383,550 SPA / week for SPA and USDs liquidity.\nBribe at the same ratio as current emissions (4:1 SPA/USDs to USDC/USDs)\nBribe plsSPA/SPA pool once it's added to the gauge moving SPA bribes to 3:1:1 (3 SPA/USDs, 1 USDC/USDs, 1 plsSPA/SPA)\n\n## Voting\nYes:\nRedirect SPA from veSPA emission, use this SPA to bribe veSPA holders.\n\nNo:\nNo change.",

      "title": "SIP-32: SPA Gauge Starting Budget and Inflation Logic",
      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Team\nReference: Arbitrum AMA Jan 30, 2023\nCreated: Jan 31, 2023\nLabels: [#Governance, #LiquidityMining]\n\n## Simple Summary\nAs the Demeter genesis campaign comes to an end, the SPA Gauge will take over the responsibility of distributing SPA to liquidity pools. How much SPA emitted to each pool is determined by a monthly gauge vote by veSPA holders. Protocols can bribe veSPA holders for votes. This proposal suggests the Sperax treasury fund the first 90 days of gauge activity. A 360 day campaign at this emission rate would inflate the circulating supply of SPA 9.66%. \n\n## Abstract\nThe current circulating supply of SPA is 1.593 billion tokens, which is 34.5% of the current total supply (total supply reduces with SPA burn). SPA from the SPA gauge are distributed with every block, ready to be claimed by the LPs of pools that include USDs and SPA. The monthly SPA budget will start at 12.825M SPA.\n\nSPA inflation from the SPA gauge is distributed to liquidity pools according to the results of the monthly gauge vote. The number of SPA distributed depends on the SPA budget. This SIP proposes a budget which matches the current emissions rate. This budget will be up for consideration every 90 days. During the first year, the total inflow will be 153.9 Million SPA if the budget isn't reduced. One year of this budget would inflate the SPA supply by 9.66%.\n\n## Motivation\nA significant portion of SPA is held within the SperaxDAO treasury and must be distributed to mature the ecosystem.\n\nThis can be done with four primary focuses\n\n1) Decentralize SPA governance\n2) Incentivize the minting and depositing of USDs into liquidity positions\n3) Incentivize DEXs to promote USDs trading pairs\n4) On-chain liquidity of SPA and USDs\n\n## Overview\nThe SPA gauge needs a starting budget for veSPA holders to allocate with votes and bribes. When considering budgets to begin the campaign, we will use current emissions and reduce aggressively with time.\n\nThe soon to be concluded Demeter Genesis campaign matched partner rewards according to $ value.\n\nWhen the rewards for the last refill were calculated (Jan 19,2023), the price of SPA was $0.0039, nearly an all time low. This resulted in the SperaxDAO emitting the most SPA per day compared to any other time in protocol history.\n\nLet’s look at a breakdown of the current weekly SPA emissions to Demeter pools. This is the proposed starting emissions rate for the SPA Gauge. The idea is to start with the highest emissions, reducing every 90 day epoch.\n\nCurrently, 427,500 SPA / day are distributed to the pools being added to the gauge:\n\nGMX/USDs 161k/day \nPLS/USDs 31k/day\nETH/USDs 55k/day\nSPA/USDs 78.5k/day \nUSDC/USDs 20k/day\nSDL/USDs 16k/day\nL2DAO/USDs 38k/day\nfxUSD/USDs 15k/day\ngDAI/USDs 13k/day\n\n## Reducing Inflation In 2023\nTo attract early usage of the gauge and to make bribes lucrative, the starting budget will start high and after every 90 days, an SIP will be posted to consider decrease. \n\n## Ensuring SPA and USDs Liquidity\nSPA bribes will be provided by the SperaxDAO to encourage veSPA holders vote for SPA/USDs and USDC/USDs. A SIP is in active discussion to redirect SPA emissions from veSPA holders to the gauge where veSPA holders can earn the SPA by voting to direct SPA emissions to the major Sperax pools.\n\n## Technical Specification\nApprove the first 90 days of the SPA gauge budget.\n\nDay 1-90 budget\n37,305,000 SPA\n\nIf additional USDs or Demeter farms are added to Demeter before the launch of the gauge, the emissions from the new pool will be added to the starting budget. RageTrade and VELA for example have been approved for Demeter Genesis but have yet to launch their farm. They will be automatically added to the SPA gauge.\n\n## Voting\nYes:\nApprove proposed budget\n\nNo:\nDeny proposed budget",

This will serve as a protection against potential governance attacks and will help to increase the attendance of voting veSPA holders.\n\n## Abstract\nThe proposal sets the quorum at the level 200 M veSPA (~⅓ of current total voting power). The current voting quorum of 20M veSPA is relatively small (~3% of total voting power) and is too easy to reach, opening the door to potential governance attacks and disengaging SPA stakers to attend votings.\n\n## Motivation\nThe voting quorum threshold (20M veSPA) is negligible regarding the current total voting power (600M+ veSPA), it is too easy to reach. This might have two negative consequences:\n\npotential governance attacks: the Community will be forced to vote against knowingly spamming/toxic proposals - just to counter such proposals;\ndisengagement of bona fide veSPA holders: as the quorum is easily reachable, they might stay passive and not attend SIP voting if they see their opinion Yes or No is passing without their support.\n\n## Overview\nSperax DAO governance procedure has been implemented last year, the first voting passed on July 2022, and 28 SIP in total were prepared, discussed, and voted. Since the DAO governance inception, the voting threshold stayed at the stable level of 20M - despite SPA staking, and thus total voting power continued to grow, reaching 623M veSPA which includes ~41% of voting power accumulated by Plutus DAO.\n\nAs the voting power grew but the voting quorum threshold didn’t - the current threshold is only 3% of the current total voting power.\n\nSuch a low share is not optimal due to two reasons:\n\nLow threshold means it is relatively easy to collect a quorum and this may be a danger in the case of potentially toxic/spam SIPs acting against the interests of the Sperax Community. The Community will be pulled into voting to counter such proposals. Rising the threshold level will not allow toxic proposals to collect a voting quorum and thus countering voting will not be needed.\n\nLow threshold might disengage bona fide SPA stakers who see the 20M quorum is always reachable, and thus they might be not motivated to vote - if they see their opinion is passing without their support. Rising the threshold level will engage SPA stakers to attend the voting.\n\nThe proposed solution is: to set the DAO voting quorum threshold at the level of 200M veSPA which is ~⅓ of the current total voting power.\n\n## Technical Specification\nSet quorum threshold on Sperax DAO Snapshot at the level of 200M veSPA.\n\n## Voting\nYes: Set the quorum threshold on Sperax DAO Snapshot at the level of 200M veSPA.\n\nNo: Keep the quorum threshold on Sperax DAO Snapshot unchanged.",

      "content": "Title: gDAI / USDs Demeter Farm Incentive Request\n\nAuthor(s): [Gains Network Team](https://gainsnetwork.io/)\n\nCreated: 01/06/23\n\nLabels: #LiquidityMining\n\n## Simple Summary\n\ngTrade by Gains Network, a synthetic derivative trading platform launching on Arbitrum, is launching a gDAI / USDs Demeter Farm. The Demeter Genesis structure was approved via SIP-17, gTrade by Gains Network is requesting a SPA incentive match for their gDAI / USDs Demeter Farm.\n\n## Abstract\n\ngTrade is launching a gDAI / USDs Demeter Farm and are looking for a SPA incentive match for the amount that gDAI increases each month.\n\n$gDAI is an ERC-4626 receipt token that:\n\n* Is given when users supply $DAI into the gTrade $gDAI vault\n* Servers as a counterparty to all trades made on the platform\n* In exchange, receives a portion of trading fees which is proportionally split among all $gDAI\n\nThe Gains Network team is asking Sperax DAO for a SPA incentive to match the dollar value of $gDAI at every rebalance period, paid in SPA.\n\nHistorically this rate has been 10-12% APY but can vary based on trading volume. This was also prior to our launch on Abritrum and with our previous vault architecture. You can see the current $gDAI price [here](https://gains.trade/vault).\n\nWith a 10-12% APY the value of $gDAI would grow 1% per month so we ask that Sperax DAO match that .8%-1% growth per month in SPA incentives. A simple mental model would be to incentivize ~.8%-1% of the $USDs liquidity in the $gDAI-$USDs pool per month\n\nFor example, if there is $1M of liquidity in the $gDAI-$USDs pool ($500k of each asset), and we expect to see $gDAI grow by 10% APY to be worth $550k, we would ask that Sperax DAO match the $50K growth by contributing $50k SPA per year.\n\n## Motivation\n\ngTrade is seeking liquidity for gDAI for our launch on Arbitrum. By launching a gDAI / USDs Demeter farm, gTrade will have an instant liquidity solution and also take advantage of pairing against USDs for deep liquidity and receive some matching incentives.\n\nStrong liquidity for gDAI will help create a strong, composable building block for all of Arbitrum DeFi. Pairing with USDs via Demeter will benefit the Sperax community by increasing USDs TVL, improving Univ3 routing for Arbitrum token pairs, and will start a partnership between Gains Network and Sperax.\n\n## Overview\n\nLaunching liquidity incentives for the gDAI pool will not only kickstart the relationship between Sperax and Gains Network, but it will also help create liquidity for gDAI as a strong, compositional building block throughout the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\nThe gDAI/USDs farm will be incentivized by the growth of gTrade and the trading fees accumulating and compounding within $gDAI and seek 1:1 matching in SPA.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nFarm: gDAI / USDs\n\nIncentives: Monthly growth of $gDAI due to trading fees accumulated + Trade PNL\n\nSPA match: 1:1 SPA match in dollar terms from the bootstrap liquidity budget to be rebalanced in dollar value on a 7 day TWAP every 2 weeks\n\nDuration: Match guaranteed for balance of 90 days from Demeter launch unless altered via governance proposal. Demeter v2 logic will determine incentives following Demeter Genesis Campaign.\n\nFarm Launch Date: As soon as the proposal is officially accepted by the DAO\n\nRisk Management: If the gDAI / USDs farm goes out of price range SPA emissions will be halted until the farm is relaunched or it goes back in range.\n\n## Voting\n\nFor:\n\nApprove SPA Rewards and Launch gDAI / USDs Demeter Farm\n\nAgainst:\n\nDeny SPA Rewards for gDAI / USDs Demeter Farm",

This makes USDC collateral less dependent on Stargate's withdrawal illiquidity and mitigates Auto-yield's binding to the declining APY of Stratgate strategy.\n\n**Abstract**\n\nWithdrawable liquidity of USDC on Stargate is low, often close to zero and this creates delays in withdrawing USDC collateral from Stargate. Also, Stargate strategy’s APY percentage on Arbitrum went down more than two-fold. In this situation, keeping USDC collateral 80% dependent on Stargate is not optimal, hence the proposal to remove Stargate-USDС as the default strategy.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nAllocating a major part of USDC collateral (80%) to Stargate-USDC strategy makes Sperax dependent on Stagtate’s low withdrawal liquidity and decreasing APY.\n\n**Overview**\n\nStargate's strategy has been implemented with SIP-4 as one of the tools to diversify the overall strategy portfolio - taking into account that the Stargate strategy had a relatively high APY of 6+%.\n\nThen, with the purpose of increasing auto-yield, SIP-12 stated that the allocation of USDC to Stargate will target 80%.\n\nFrom today’s perspective, this needs to be reviewed:\n\nFirst, there is a liquidity issue when there is a need to withdraw USDC collateral from Stargate. Despite Stargate’s Arbitrum USDC pool reported liquidity looking appropriate ($15.3M), from Sperax's perspective, to mobilize collateral from Stargate quickly back to the Core Vault for use in other yield strategies or for redemptions by users, Sperax needs another type of liquidity - withdrawable balance liquidity, that in Stargate case is low or often zero.\n\nSecond, Stargate strategy’s APY percentage on Arbitrum went down more than two-fold from initial figures - reaching only 2.8%, Stargate-USDC farm on Arbitrum is not listed by Stargate in their “Top Farms” anymore.\n\nThe alternative to this proposal is keeping Stargate as the default strategy with the targeted allocation of 80% USDC This will keep Sperax bound to the illiquidity of withdrawal and to declining Auto-yield derived from declining Stargate pool APY.\n\n**Technical Specification**\n\nRemove the Stargate strategy as the default strategy with 80% allocation target for USDC.\n\n**Voting**\n\nYes: Remove Stargate-USDС strategy as default strategy\nNo: Keep Stargate-USDC strategy as default strategy",

      "content": "Title: SIP-26: Migrate SPA Incentives from Saddle FRAXBP-USDs to Bribe L2D4 Farm\n\nAuthor(s): Sperax Team\n\nReference: https://www.saddle.community/t/sip-x-deploy-l2d4-pool-and-gauge-on-arbitrum/541\n\nCreated: 12/26/22\n\nLabels: #LiquidityMining\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nRedirect SPA emissions from Saddle FRAXBP-USDs farm to bribe the Saddle L2D4 farm at launch. Total incentives directed to bribe the L2D4 farm will be $2000 SPA/wk or roughly 57k SPA/day at todays value, from the Bootstrap liquidity budget. Discontinue incentivizing the FRAXBP-USDs farm when L2D4 launches.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThere are currently 55,555 SPA/day incentivizing ~$795k TVL on the Saddle FRAXBP-USDs farm. This incentive, at current prices, amounts to roughly $8.5k/mo in incentives. As outlined on the [Saddle forum](https://www.saddle.community/t/sip-x-deploy-l2d4-pool-and-gauge-on-arbitrum/541) a new pool and gauge will be live featuring FRAX, Alchemix, dForce and Sperax called L2D4. This pool will be incentivized from each partner via bribing the FRAX gauge. This proposal is asking the Sperax community to fund bribes to this new pool from the bootstrap liquidity budget at a rate of $2,000/week, or about 57k SPA/day at todays value, by migrating the emissions from the current FRAXBP-USDs pool to L2D4.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe L2D4 pool will offer users a unique opportunity to gather multiple governance tokens in the Arbitrum ecosystem and also aggregate stablecoin liquidity and improve routing for USDs. By partnering with FRAX, Alchemix and dForce, USDs can benefit from synergistic communities and improved TVL.\n\n## Overview\n\nCommit to bribing the new L2D4 farm at launch by migrating rewards from the current FRAXBP-USDs farm to L2D4 at a rate of $2k SPA/week. Discontinue incentivizing FRAXBP-USDs farm when L2D4 is launched.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nL2D4 will be launching on Saddle. Consisting of the stablecoins $FRAX/$alUSD/$USX/$USDs and provide yield farming incentives in 6 governance tokens for a period of no less than 6 months in the native protocols goverances tokens which are: $FXS, $AlCX, $DF, $SPA, $L2DAO, $SDL. This proposal is contingent on equal incentivizing from FRAX, Alchemix, dForce and Sperax. Incentivizes in SPA from the Bootstrap liquidity budget at a rate of $2k SPA/week for a duration of a minimum of 6 months or until a governance proposal specifies otherwise. SPA will be rebalanced on a rolling 14 day basis based on a 14 day TWAP SPA price. The FRAXBP-USDs farm would no longer be incentives with SPA if this proposal passes, as its emissions budget will be utilized to incentivize L2D4.\n\n## Voting\n\nFor:\n\nYes - Transfer rewards from FRAXBP-USDs to bribe L2D4 at a rate of $2k SPA/wk\n\nAgainst:\n\nNo",

      "content": "SIP-25: Relaunch Sperax Liquidity Pools Through Demeter\nAuthor(s): Sperax Core Team\nReference: N/A\nCreated: 12/12/22\nLabels: #LiquidityMining\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis SIP proposes moving the USDC - USDs and SPA - USDs farms to the Demeter protocol. These farms will continue at the same SPA emissions rate.\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn order to improve the overall experience for Demeter users and traders, we will house all future Sperax farms on the Demeter page. This action will require users to unstake from the current farms and restake in the new Demeter farms with updated price ranges.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrently Sperax primary liquidity pools are advertised on app.sperax.io/farms and the LP tokens are staked in stand-alone farm contracts. This fragments the user experience because currently, investors are required to check both https://demeter.sperax.io and https://app.sperax.io/farm to find all available farms.\n\nMoving USDC / USDs and SPA / USDs farm to a Demeter managed launched farm, advertised on demeter.sperax.io, makes the most sense from a UX standpoint.\n\nOverview\n\nFunded via the bootstrapping liquidity budget, 140,000 SPA/week is provided to the USDC/USDs pool and 550,000 SPA/week to the SPA/USDs pool. These emissions will be redirected to the new USDC/USDs and SPA/USDs demeter pools at the same emission rate for an improved UX.\n\nMoving liquidity pools to one site will reduce any fragmentation within the Sperax ecosystem. The objective is to create one venue where both DAOs and investors liquidity needs can be serviced. After this proposal all liquidity pools will be on one site.\n\nOnce all liquidity pools are hosted on one landing page, users can onramp liquidity, deposit liquidity into pools and collect rewards all in one destination.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nIncentive Size: Continue at 140,000 SPA/week USDC/USDs and 550,000 SPA/week SPA/USDs\n\nFunding: Bootstrapping liquidity budget.",

In launching a Sperax Demeter pool, Rage plans to incentivize liquidity by providing RAGE tokens. In efforts of scaling this pool, Rage requests Sperax to match reward contributions 1:1, according to dollar value during Demeter Genesis.\n\n## Abstract\n\nRage Trade is looking to launch a RAGE/USDs Demeter Farm.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRage Trade is seeking more avenues for stakers to leverage their yield such as minting stablecoins against their LP positions. By launching a RAGE/Demeter farm, Rage will be able to deepen liquidity.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe RAGE/USDs Demeter farm will initially be incentivized with $10,000 worth of RAGE/month. Rage Trade seeks 1:1 matching in SPA.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\n**Farm:** RAGE/USDs\n\n**Incentives:** RAGE = $10,000 worth of RAGE/month\n\n**SPA match:** 1:1 SPA match in dollar terms from the bootstrap liquidity budget. To be rebalanced in dollar value on a 7 day TWAP every 2 weeks.\n\n**Duration:** Match guaranteed for balance of 90 days from Demeter launch unless altered via governance proposal.\n\n**Farm Launch Date:** TBD (Depends when the RAGE token will be live)\n\n**Risk Management:** If the RAGE / USDs farm goes out of price range SPA emissions will be halted until the farm is relaunched or it goes back in range.\n\n## Voting\n\n**Yes:** Approve launch of RAGE/USDs Farm\n\n**No:** Reject launch of RAGE/USDs Farm",

      "title": "SIP-23: Rage Trade x Sperax Partnership",
      "content": "Title: SIP-23: Rage Trade x Sperax Partnership\n\n**Author(s):** [Rage Trade Team](https://twitter.com/rage_trade/following) \n\n**Created:** November 29th, 2022\n\n**Labels:** #RealYield, #DeltaNeutral, #GMX, #YieldStrategy, #USDsUseCase\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal is to forge the start of a multilevel partnership between Rage Trade and Sperax. The Rage team proposes seeding USDC from SperaxUSD collateral, to earn yield by staking USDC into Rage’s Delta Neutral Vaults to earn yield. If the proposal passes, collateral will be deployed following a successful 8 week monitoring of vault performance.\n\n\nSeeding USDC collateral in Rage Trade’s vaults will not only allow diversification, but it will also pave the way for future synergies such as creating more use-cases for USDs within DeFi.\n\n## Abstract\n\nRage Trade's Delta Neutral Vaults are a set of contracts that allow users to pool in funds for providing liquidity on GMX in a delta neutral way while earning ETH rewards on GMX. This vault operates on-chain for minimising exposure on ETH and BTC by performing a short on Aave + Uniswap with the help of two separate risk vaults.\n\n### What are the Vaults?\n\nRisk-Off Vault: Allows users to deposit USDC that can serve as collateral on Aave, while earning the Aave Supply APR as well as a portion of ETH Rewards from GMX based on the utilisation ratio.\n\nRisk-On Vault: Earns yield on GLP while neutralising ETH & BTC price exposure. Since proportions of ETH and BTC can change on GMX, the vault updates the open short on every rebalance.\n\nBy staking USDC in either vault, Sperax can be paid out in real yield by our USDC denominated delta neutral vaults. Our vaults will have a $5M smart contract insurance policy live on day 1 which has been paid for completely by the Rage Trade team.\n\nRage Trade also proposes to open a $RAGE/USDs Demeter Farm once the $RAGE token launches on mainnet in Q1 2023.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRage Trade is an ETH perpetual platform that facilitates perps and perpetual products on Arbitrum. Rage Trade’s two-vault system allows for users to take advantage of delta neutral positions in the GMX ecosystem according to their risk appetite. Rage Trade’s vaults are also great avenues for stablecoin protocols to deploy some of their USDC backing and earn real yield. Depositing into Rage Trade’s vaults would not only be a great opportunity for Sperax to take advantage of a high-yielding delta neutral stablecoin farm, but also an opportunity to develop a long-lasting relationship between both protocols, as well as the introduction of a new Demeter farm incentivized by RAGE tokens.\n\nA Strategic partnership would benefit both parties;\n\n**Sperax Benefits:**\n\n* Integration with the largest perpetual protocol on Arbitrum\n* Access to the highest yielding delta neutral stable farm on Arbitrum\n* Exposure to high-yielding real yield delta neutral vaults with no fees or lock-ups\n* A new Demeter pool - $RAGE/USDs Uniswap V3 pool\n* Deeper liquidity in Demeter\n* Co-marketing efforts\n* Further use-cases for USDs\n\n## Overview\n\n1. Sperax will allocate up-to 10% of the total USDC collateral from SperaxUSD collateral and earn yield by taking advantage of Rage Trade’s Risk-Off delta neutral GMX vault, following a successful 8 week monitoring of vault performance.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\n**1. How does the strategy work?**\n\nRage’s Delta Neutral Vaults turn GMX's GLP into a stablecoin farm by hedging the ETH & BTC exposure. This is done by catering to two types of users: the risk-on users and the risk-off users.\n\nThe Risk-On Vault allows users to provide delta neutral GMX liquidity by depositing sGLP or USDC while benefiting from trader losses. The vault hedges ETH & BTC price exposure in GLP by systematically opening short positions on Aave. Additionally, the Risk-On Vault provides an extra boost in yield by auto-compounding the ETH rewards into sGLP & restaking earned esGMX.\n\nThe Risk-Off Vault has no liquidation risk or GMX risk and earns interest from lending USDC on Aave. It also earns a fraction of ETH rewards from GLP based on the amount of USDC lent to the Risk-On Vault.\n\n**2. What are the fees involved?**\n\n* Risk-on Vault\n  * Fees paid to Uniswap\n    * Uniswap V3 ETH fee : 0.05% fee pool (0.15% max swap slippage threshold)\n    * Uniswap V3 BTC fee : 0.30% fee pool (0.90% max swap slippage threshold)\n  * Fees paid to Aave\n    * Aave Borrow Rate ETH : 3-4% APY (variable)\n    * Aave Borrow Rate BTC : 3-4% APY (variable)\n  * Slippage Fee : 0.5% on deposit/withdraw\n* Risk-off Vault\n  * N/A\n* Protocol Fees\n  * 15% on ETH rewards accrued from GMX\n\n**3. What is the expected APY?**\n\n* Risk-on Vault : 15-25% APY\n* Risk-off Vault : 6-8% APY\n\n**4. Most importantly, what are the risks involved in investing in this strategy for the SPA community?**\n\nRisks\n\n* Risk-on Vault\n  * Inherent GMX risk\n    * Once traders are profitable on GMX, it is at the expense of GLP holders\n* Risk-off Vault\n  * If arbitrum sequencer went down and the entire chain is halted\n    * Won’t be able to pay / rebalance AAVE positions\n  * (No GMX risk, no price risk, and no liquidation risk)\n\n* Tokens that are deposited in Rage Trade’s vaults are managed by contract and do not sit in any wallet\n  * All contract changes will be behind a 4-6 multisig where 3 of the signees are Rage Trade team and 3 signees are amongst trusted community members\n\n* Both vaults are covered up to $5M total for smart contract exploits due to our Sherlock insurance policy paid for by Rage Trade\n\n**5. How exactly does the strategy maintain delta neutrality? What is the hedging mechanism?**\n\nThe risk-on vault updates its hedge position every 12 hours or if one of two things occur— if there is a price change in ETH or BTC of more than 5% or if the health factor on AAVE goes below 1.2.\n\nIf ETH BTC weight changes:\n\n* As weight decreases, we reduce our short positions\n* As weight increases, we increase our short positions\n\nIf ETH BTC price changes:\n\n* As price decreases, we transfer profits from shorts to GLP\n* As price increases, we transfer profits from GLP to shorts\n\n**6. Is any component of the hedging mechanism off-chain?**\n\nRage’s hedging strategy is fully on-chain and uses Aave, Balancer & Uniswap to create the hedges. For triggering rebalances, we run keepers bots that can be permisionlessly run by anyone in the community.\n\n**Security Due-diligence:** Rage Trade has secured a $5m smart contract exploit insurance policy which has been completely paid for by Rage Trade and will be live on day 1. Our first audit has been completed by Sherlock, who has additionally provided us with the smart contract insurance. We will provide security details such as audit reports, github access, and more.\n\n**Risk Management:** Rage Trade vaults do not enforce any deposit or withdrawal fees (besides slippage costs), as well as any lock-up periods.\n\n**Rage Trade’s Docs:** https://docs.rage.trade/\n\n## Voting\n\nYes: Deploy 10% of the USDC collateral held in Sperax USD collateral vault into Rage Trade’s Risk-Off vault to earn yield. Collateral will be deployed only after a successful 8 week monitoring of vault performance.\n\nNo: Reject the proposal. \n",

      "title": "SIP-22: Camelot x Sperax Partnership",
      "content": "Title: SIP-22: Camelot x Sperax Partnership\nAuthor(s): IronBoots, Myrddin\nReference: Telegram group + calls\nCreated: 17/11/2022\nLabels: #LiquidityMining, #YieldStrategy, #USDsUseCase\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal will forge the initial partnership between Sperax and Camelot DEX, enabling the growth and expansion of USDs utility on Arbitrum. Camelot aims to become the native Arbitrum DEX; therefore, this proposal will establish Sperax as a core launch partner. USDs will be one of the first stableswap pools on the Camelot DEX, thereby giving it an advantageous position to increase both activity and TVL. Camelot is committed to providing liquidity mining incentives through our farms and genesis pools, as well as development work for the future integration of the Camelot protocol within the Demeter app.\n\n#### Camelot commitments:\n\n* Camelot to allocate 2.5% (0.25% of total supply) of its partnerships emissions to Sperax. 6 months cliff and two years vesting.\n* Camelot to allocate 3% (0.2% of total supply) of its genesis pools emissions to SPA/USDs and USDs/USDC pools.\n* Camelot to create and incentivize SPA/USDs and USDs/USDC farms after its launch\n* Camelot to provide native integration and support to USDs and SPA\n\n#### Sperax commitments:\n\n* Sperax to incentivize genesis pools with SPA rewards ($30k value)\n* Sperax to match the normal farm incentives with SPA ($ value TBD after launch)\n* Camelot and Sperax to engage in a collaborative marketing effort\n\n## Abstract\n\nCamelot is a highly efficient DEX building liquidity infrastructure to support Arbitrum native protocols. The Camelot protocol is specifically designed to provide other builders with permissionless options to manage and incentivize their liquidity. Protocols can set custom fees per pool, as well as buy/sell directions, and most importantly, they can have a high level of control over their emissions through our Nitro pools.\n\nNitro pools allow protocols to provide rewards to pools (or single-staked assets) based on varying requirements, for example, only for LPs that have locked for +3 months or have deposited a certain amount. These Nitro rewards can be in any token and are additional to the base $GRAIL yield rewards. This level of optionality means that protocols can build deep liquidity that is sustainable and long-term.\n\nCamelot aims to support native protocols to achieve more effective returns on their liquidity strategies while allowing the community and users to earn even further yield by being long-term lockers. Most importantly, we are committed to developing our liquidity infrastructure with other Arbitrum protocols - for example, the custom integration within Sperax’s Demeter app.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDeep liquidity and utility for a native stablecoin are essential for any ecosystem, making Camelot and Sperax aligned by allowing USDs to become broadly used on Arbitrum. Camelot will benefit from this proposal by building deep DEX liquidity for USDs and the SPA token. To achieve this, Camelot is committed to using GRAIL emissions to deepen Sperax liquidity, and therefore we will benefit from the additional SPA rewards. In addition, Camelot will be allocating a partner allocation that vests directly to the Sperax protocol.\n\nThis proposal will therefore cement Sperax as one of the main launch partners of Camelot, marking a significant milestone for our vision to support the ecosystem and become the native Arbitrum DEX.\n\nSperax will benefit from a more effective return on their emissions (through Nitro pool requirements). With the additional Camelot rewards, both USDs and SPA will see increased TVL and utility across the ecosystem. By being a launch partner, Sperax will additionally be able to have an advantageous position to create new USDs pairs, as many new Arbitrum protocols will be launching through Camelot. Camelot is committed to supporting the use of USDs within partner dapps and pools on our protocol.\n\n## Proposal Overview\n\nFirstly, as a sign of commitment to establishing a long-term partnership, Camelot is allocating a portion of GRAIL that will directly vest to the Sperax protocol. Through this, both protocols will be in close alignment, and Sperax will have direct exposure to the broader success of Camelot.\n\nSecondly, the proposal will be for initial SPA incentives for USDs/USDC and SPA/USDs pools. Camelot is committing to incentivizing these pools with GRAIL emissions, therefore asking Sperax to match these 1:1 in USD value equivalent.\n\n* Match Camelot emissions for USDs/USDC and SPA/USDs genesis pools (live ten days before launch and used to bootstrap the initial liquidity)\n* Match Camelot emissions for USDs/USDC and SPA/USDs for Nitro pools post-launch\n\nIn addition, we propose the integration of Camelot pools within Sperax’s Demeter app. This will allow significant utility for users to open up customizable pools for USDs with double rewards. Camelot is focused on bringing flexibility to protocols and is committed to supporting Sperax through emissions and development work.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\n#### 1. Partnership allocation\n\n10% of the total GRAIL supply (in xGRAIL, vested over 2y with a 6-months cliff) will be allocated to partners who commit to migrating their liquidity and incentives to Camelot.\n\nTo lay the foundation for a solid and long-term collaboration, Camelot offers Sperax 2.5% of this allocation (e.g., 0.25% of total GRAIL supply). The conditions for this basis are Sperax being an active partner and committed to incentivizing liquidity on Camelot post-launch.\n\n#### 2. Genesis pools*\n\nAs part of the proposal, Camelot is committed to allocating xGRAIL rewards to USDs/USDC and SPA/USDs genesis pools to incentivize deeper liquidity and increased yields.\n\nThe total GRAIL genesis pools’ allocation for partners will be 5% of the total GRAIL suppl. We offer to allocate 3% of this pool to Sperax (0.2% of total supply), distributed over six months. This allocation will be split between the two USDs/USDC and SPA/USDs pairs, and could be increased over time if the pool is performing well.\n\nIn return for this allocation of GRAIL rewards, Sperax commits to incentivizing the genesis pools with $30k worth of SPA (using a 15-day rolling average) over six months.\n\nThose SPA will be added directly into the Genesis pool as a double incentive and be distributed over six months like the Genesis pool’s base rewards.\n\n> *Genesis pools will start on November 22th. Users will have ten days (seven before the public sale and three during) to deposit Camelot LP tokens into the Nitro pools and earn a pro-rata amount based on the GRAIL supply allocated to each pool.\n>\n>\n>\n> Depositors will linearly earn emissions in xGRAIL during the six months following the public sale. They can withdraw anytime, at which point their share of the emissions will redirect to the remaining LP tokens.\n>\n>\n>\n> New Genesis Pool deposits will not be allowed, however, after the end of the public sale.\n>\n>\n>\n> Since Camelot is not valued yet and the sale is based on a price discovery mechanism, we suggest using our average projected FDV of $20M as a reference. With a $20M FDV, the 3% would represent a value of $30k worth of xGRAIL incentives that would be, at minimum, matched with an equivalent SPA value. It’s important to note, xGRAIL does not have a price as it’s the locked version of GRAIL, and for the purposes of this equation, we are assuming a 1:1 ratio.\n\n#### 3. Native integration and support\n\nSperax will be listed on Camelot’s frontend and natively integrated for trade routing, allowing for broader utility and increased volume of the SPA and USDs tokens volume.\n\nMore generally, Camelot will collaborate in any possible way to effectively integrate USDs and SPA liquidity, including setting adapted customized fees on pairs if needed.\n\n#### 4. Yield farms\n\nOnce fully launched and in addition to the genesis pool rewards, Camelot is also committed to allocating ongoing liquidity mining incentives to USDs/USDC and SPA/USDs pools. These emissions will be periodically re-adjusted based on the TVL, fees generated, and the amount of SPA incentives committed to Nitro pools.\n\nAs a counterpart, Sperax will create USDs/USDC and SPA/USDs Nitro pools to add an additional layer of SPA incentives to the participants of those two farms.\n\nTo guarantee the fairness of the process, Sperax will rebalance its incentives to maintain them to a 1:1 ratio based on GRAIL and SPA dollar values. The specific amount and value will be confirmed later between both parties. Eventually, Sperax emissions will be determined by their gauge model.\n\n#### 5. Collaborative marketing\n\nSperax will engage in collaborative marketing efforts as a launch partner through AMAs, posts & retweets when the launch is announced and incentivize its users to deposit into its genesis pools.\n\n## Voting\n\nFor: Allow Sperax protocol to partner with Camelot and to spend SPA emissions on its genesis pools and farms. Requesting $30,000/15-day moving average which comes to 3.4 Mn SPA tokens.\n\nAgainst: Sperax to not form a partnership with Camelot.",

This produces a barrier for anyone using USDs as a cheap way to USDC from other whitelisted collateral.\n\n## Abstract\n\nOver the last 30 days, USDC and DAI has been nearly 100% redeemed by community members. This likely resulted from the combination of volatile times and low redeem fees for USDs. With a redeem fee of 0.2%, it was often more profitable to use the SperaxUSD protocol to swap than it was to swap using Uniswap.\n\n## Motivation\n\nA higher redemption fee will deter this activity, working toward reducing reliance on VST and FRAX. In the future this will be replaced with dynamic fees to obtain diversified USDs collateral.\n\n## Overview\n\nUsers have been using Sperax USD as a means to swap various collateral types. For example, when VST introduced GLP vaults users were minting USDs with VST and redeeming USDC. You can see in the screenshot from app.sperax.io/analytics, the USDC has been completely drained, leaving only FRAX and VST.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigp6nwpferprf2up5752vuoq57qeyqncr2qusfd7evgoezcmxvyxq)\n    \n\nDespite a good depth in terms of liquidity for our Uniswap v3 USDs/USDC pool, we have been seeing the majority of the users redeeming their USDs tokens for USDC. Below is an example of a situation where the user may redeem instead of swap.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicmv3y5elc3skiz2zxcox4y52san3e72eekjutuqzvh5rcnbaph4m)\n    \n\nIn the above situation, it was more profitable for this user to redeem for USDC instead of swap USDs for USDC on Uniswap. By increasing the redemption fee, more users will be encouraged to swap on the Uniswap pool instead of redeeming from the protocol itself.\n\nThis will be further replaced with Dynamic fees in the future: The mint/redeem fee will fluctuate based on how much yield is offered for the collateral type, and the target weight for that collateral type in the pool. For example, if the collateral pool has too much VST, and the VST collateral yield strategy is low, the redeeming fee for VST would lessen and VST minting would become more expensive. In contrast, if the collateral pool has too little USDC, redeeming for USDC becomes more expensive, and minting with USDC becomes cheaper.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nIncrease USDC redeem fee from 0.2% to 0.5%",

      "content": "SIP-20: Launch ETH - USDs Demeter Genesis Pool\n\nAuthor(s): Sperax Core Team\n\nReference: N/A\n\nCreated: 11/16/22\n\nLabels: #LiquidityMining\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis SIP proposes launching an ETH-USDs farm on Uniswap v3, launched via Demeter. SperaxUSD to provide SPA incentives at 55,555 SPA/day. Rewards will be reassessed after four weeks, emissions may be adjusted depending on SPA token price and TVL attracted into the pool and demand for the pool.\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn order to improve the overall experience for Demeter users and traders, an ETH - USDs pool is required. Incentivizing this pool with SPA will allow for sufficient liquidity to allow for improved routing from ETH to Demeter pairs seamlessly.\n\n## Motivation\n\nETH is money. To allow the Ethereum community to spend their money and buy major assets deployed with Demeter, we need an ETH - USDs pair. This allows a user to trade from ETH to other protocol tokens seeded against USDs but it’s routed through the ETH - USDs pool and the other Demeter pool seeded against USDs, if this is the cheapest option. This allows for maximum effectiveness for Demeter liquidity providers to earn fees from users swapping in and out of the tokens.\n\nOverview\n\nUsing the bootstrapping liquidity budget, 55,555 SPA/day should create a pool with well over 500k TVL according to the current trading price of SPA at 0.006. Thanks to the tokenomics of SperaxUSD, this increase in TVL directly drives value to SPA. So this TVL could increase the pools TVL in the future.\n\nThis is a self reinforcing phenomenon because as the Demeter experience becomes better, USDs non-rebasing TVL grows, which increases cash flow to SPA, increasing SPA price, which increases the pools TVL, repeating the process. SPA goes up in price, pool rewards increase, and liquidity for USDs increases in parallel. Positive flywheel in action.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nIncentive Size: 55,555 SPA/day\n\nFunding: Bootstrapping liquidity budget.\n\nEnd of campaign: Continue at 55,555 SPA/day until a new SIP specifies otherwise or Sperax Gauge is launched.",

Vela is seeking a 1:1 incentive match for the 90 day Genesis Campaign as a Day 1 Launch Partner. Vela plans to incentivize the Demeter farm initially with 20,000 VELA /mo.\n\n## Abstract\n\nVela is looking to launch a VELA/USDs Demeter Farm and be included in the Day 1 Genesis Partner Cohort as approved by SIP-17. Vela will be migrating their token, VELA, to Arbitrum in preparation for their protocol launch.\n\n## Motivation\n\nVela is seeking liquidity for VELA on Arbitrum. By launching a VELA / USDs Demeter farm, Vela will have an instant liquidity solution and also take advantage of pairing against USDs to deepen liquidity and receive matched SPA incentives as part of the Day 1 Demeter Genesis Launch that was approved in SIP-17. Pairing with USDs via Demeter will benefit the Sperax community by increasing USDs TVL, improving Univ3 routing for Arbitrum token pairs, and start paving the way for a fruitful partnership between Vela and Sperax that has many future synergies. Vela will be migrating their token, VELA, around middle to late November, a full timeline is still under construction for this process. Thus, the VELA / USDs farm will be launched once the token migration occurs, and the community will be kept up to date on this timing. As the partnership discussions have been ongoing between Vela and Sperax, Vela is requesting to be included in the Day 1 Launch Cohort, to ensure high incentives and quick adoption for their farm.\n\nAdditional partnership avenues are under discussion, and include;\n\n* Low risk, high APR strategy option for Sperax USDC collateral\n* Potential use case for USDs through VELA platform\n  * LP contribution in USDs\n  * Using USDs for trading collateral\n\n## Overview\n\nThe VELA/USDs Demeter farm will be incentivized initially by 20,000 VELA/month and is requesting to be included as a Day 1 Genesis Launch Partner as approved in SIP-17. Vela is asking for 1:1 matching in SPA, rebalancing in dollar terms every 14 days, for the 90 days Genesis Campaign.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nFarm: VELA / USDs\n\nIncentives: VELA = 20,000 VELA/month (20,000 VELA = $12,000 at the time of submitting this proposal)\n\nSPA match: 1:1 SPA match in dollar terms from the bootstrap liquidity budget. To be rebalanced in dollar value on a 7 day TWAP every 2 weeks\n\nDuration: Match guaranteed for balance of 90 days from Demeter launch unless altered via governance proposal. Demeter v2 logic will determine incentives following the Demeter Genesis Campaign.\n\nFarm Launch Date: TBD (Depends on Vela token migration timeline)\n\nRisk Management: If the VELA / USDs farm goes out of price range SPA emissions will be halted until the farm is relaunched or it goes back in range.\n\n## Voting\n\nFor:\n\nApprove SPA Rewards and Launch VELA / USDs Demeter Farm\n\nAgainst:\n\nDeny SPA Rewards for VELA / USDs Demeter Farm",

      "content": "**SIP-17:** Launch GMX-USDs, PLS-USDs, SDL-USDs, L2DAO-USDs, Approve Demeter Genesis Structure\n\nAuthor(s): Sperax Team\nReference: n/a\nCreated: Oct 26, 2022\n\nLabels: [ex: #Governance, #LiquidityMining]\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFund the Demeter Launch Partners and a 90-Day Genesis Campaign.\n\nThe Sperax Demeter Protocol front end will launch in November. To prepare for launch, the Sperax team built a group of Launch partners, consisting of top Arbitrum projects. The Demeter Launch partners are GMX, PlutusDAO, Saddle and Layer2DAO. This SIP proposes a SPA allocation to match the Launch partners’ reward contributions 1:1, according to dollar value during Demeter Genesis. Genesis is a proposed 90 day campaign which let’s DAOs apply for 1:1 matching SPA rewards (via SIP).\n\n**Launch Partner Farms**\n\nGMX - USDs emitting GMX, SPA\n\nPLS - USDs emitting PLS, SPA\n\nSDL - USDs emitting SDL, SPA\n\nL2DAO - USDs emitting L2DAO, SPA\n\n## Abstract\n\nDAOs that launch farms with Demeter during Genesis can submit an SIP requesting a matched SPA allocation. The Demeter Genesis cohort consists of GMX, PlutusDAO, SaddleDAO and Layer2DAO. These protocols will launch farms day 1 with USDs to receive the full 90 days of matched rewards at their desired contribution amount. The emissions rate will be rebalanced according to dollar value to match the DAOs contributions every 14 days. New DAOs that apply for Genesis matching can receive up to **$10,000 worth of SPA / month.**\n\n## Motivation\n\nDAOs require incentivization to pair their token against USDs, opposed to ETH or other stablecoins.\n\nThis campaign will provide SPA as incentive to do so, but only if the DAO brings their own incentives. By limiting matching rewards to 90 days following Demeter launch, DAOs are incentivized to launch early, capturing more emission subsidies.\n\nThe Sperax team and community will closely monitor SPA sell pressure from emissions. This will better inform the economic design of the SPA gauge and the various pain points to solve with future Demeter versions.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis promotional Genesis campaign will assess Demeter’s ability to attract USDs and SPA into liquidity pools. This campaign is designed to increase USDs TVL and liquidity. If many projects pair their token against USDs, this will position USDs as the most liquid stablecoin in Arbitrum. This could make USDs the de facto Arbitrum trading pair, even with reduced incentives.\n\nAs TVL increases, the protocol revenue shall also increase, driving more revenue to the protocol, paying more in staking rewards and burning more SPA each week.\n\n\n\n**Demeter Launch Partner Funding**\n\nGMX contributing $20,000 GMX / Month = ~1,333,333 SPA Month 1\n\nSaddle contributing 333,3333 SDL / Month = ~333,333 SPA Month 1\n\nPlutusDAO contributing 14,000 PLS / Month = ~345,333 SPA Month 1\n\nLayer2DAO contributing 400k L2DAO / Month = ~233,333 SPA Month 1\n\n\n\n**Limit Genesis to 90 Days after Launch**\n\nBy cutting matching rewards after 90 days of launch, users are incentivized to participate early to capture more emission subsidies for longer.\n\nFor example: A DAO that launches a farm 45 days after Genesis launch can write a governance proposal to receive at max 45 days of matched rewards.\n\n**Receiving Genesis Matching Rewards**\n\nAny DAO can submit an SIP on forum.sperax.io to request SPA emissions on their pool. If the SIP passes the Sperax DAO process that farm would then receive matching SPA incentives up to $10,000 / month. Once the pool is live and the DAO’s incentives are deposited, the SPA will be matched.\n\nUsing a SIP system provides flexibility to the Sperax community to add or remove Genesis farms from receiving the matching Genesis rewards. For instance, a farm not attracting meaningful USDs TVL could be removed or receive decreased SPA rewards.\n\n**Preparing For Sperax Gauge**\n\nBy the time the Genesis campaign concludes, the Sperax team will have published the Sperax Gauge parameters for community approval.

      "content": "Title: SIP-16: Add Saddle USDC - FRAX Strategy\nAuthor(s): Sperax Core Team\nReference: AMAs\nCreated: Oct 25, 2022\nLabels: #NewYieldStrategy\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nSperax Core team proposes to introduce a new investment strategy for USDC and FRAX within the USDs collateral pool: Saddle Finance FRAX-USDC-BP.\n\n## Abstract\n\nAdd a new yield strategy for USDC and FRAX. The primary yield strategy for USDC will now be the Saddle Exchange FRAX-USDC-BP.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDiversify yield generation. Stargate is currently the primary USDC yield generation strategy. This was a reasonable short term strategy to increase yield, but the cross-chain bridging risk isn’t favorable. This new flavor of strategy keeps the USDC collateral away from bridges while unlocking a new yield source for both USDC and FRAX.\n\n## Overview\n\nUSDC deposited into the collateral fund when minting USDs will be sent to Saddle until otherwise specified in an SIP. FRAX that is deposited will be sent to saddle unless needed to pair with VST for the VST-FRAX strategy, in which case the FRAX will be used to keep VST slippage during the deposit to below 0.1% slippage.\n\nTo start, the Sperax team will allocate the remaining USDC in vault core, pair it with equal FRAX, then deploy these assets to Saddle.exchange and stake the LP token for SDL rewards.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://QmNizvkd7kwxt38q7awyhTrGpr2L19RfJJ12TPV4ZpwkAt)\n    \n\nThis pool has significant rewards which has attracted healthy liquidity. Currently over 3.8M USDC+FRAX reside in the pool. This offers us the opportunity to deploy capital from the collateral fund into this pool without significantly diminishing APR.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\n1. How does depositing collateral to the strategy work?\n\nThe contract sends collateral to FRAX-USDC-BP, which returns lp token for the liquidity provided (saddleFraxBP). Next, the saddleFraxBP LP are staked in the Saddle gauge to generate SDL yield in addition to trading fees.\n\n2. How does withdrawal work?\n\nThe withdrawal is also a two step process, triggered when a user specifies their desire to redeem USDs for USDC or Frax.\n\nThe contracts first check if the desired collateral is available in VaultCore. If there isn’t sufficient funds in the VaultCore, the protocol will redeem part of the saddleFraxBP\n\n3. How is the yield generated?\n\ni. Transaction fees\n\nii. governance Token rewards → When we deposit the sToken to the farm the saddleFraxBP LP is staked into the Saddle gauge to start accruing SDL rewards (follows a variable APR approach).\n\n4. How is yield transferred into USDs?\n\ni. Fees → Paid in stablecoins, deposited into the protocol to mint for USDs\n\nii. Governance token → Will buyback USDs or approved collateral using SDL prioritizing the most profitable route\n\n5. Pairing with Frax\n\ni. New FRAX entering the collateral pool will be sent to Saddle Finance\n\nii. If FRAX is needed to reduce VST slippage when allocating VST, FRAX will be used to keep slippage <0.1%.",

      "content": "Title: Apply Max Cap to VST Collateral\nAuthor(s): Sperax Team\nReference: n/a\nCreated: Oct 10, 2022\nLabels: #YieldStrategy\n\n**Simple Summary:**\n\nImplement a short term collateral breakdown system that encourages diversification of USDs collateral type and yield strategy. If a collateral type is over the maximum composition weight, the front end won’t list this asset when minting USDs.\n\nUntil a proper target collateral rebalancing swaps/fee adjustment logic is completed, a max cap of 10% will be applied to VST strategies due to thin liquidity.\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nTo ensure appropriate diversification of yield generation strategy and collateral type, the Sperax team proposes a short term risk framework. This framework is designed to be replaced with a proper collateral rebalancing strategy (swaps + responsive fees) according to a community approved risk framework.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nCurrently 73% of the USDs collateral pool consists of the VST-FRAX Curve strategy. This is a lucrative investment strategy but puts significant reliance on the peg stability of VST and FRAX. VST being a young stabelcoin project doesn’t have many venues with deep liquidity. To ensure the capability to generate yield and liquidity for USDs redeemers, we suggest capping VST until liquidity improves.\n\nBy capping VST at 10%, the total breakdown should max out at roughly 10% VST and 10% FRAX in the Curve strategy. The rest of collateral will be more liquid stablecoins like USDC, FRAX and DAI.\n\n**Overview:**\n\nWhile a proper risk framework is being designed, one which includes logic to diversify asset and yield strategy, the Max Cap logic should reduce the risk to any specific investment strategy and consequently, asset type. Such a max cap can ensure USDs doesn’t become a wrapper for any one strategy rather remains a diversified, liquid-staked stablecoin protocol.\n\n**Technical Specification:**\n\nA 10% cap on VST implies ~20% of the collateral strategy will be deployed to the VST-FRAX curve pool (10% VST 10% FRAX).\n\nOnce a specific asset is above its max cap (specific asset value/total collateral value) the ability to mint USDs with the overweight asset(s) on [app.sperax.io](http://app.sperax.io/) front end will be turned off. Redemptions will continue for the asset(s).\n\nMinting will resume once the strategy comprises less than the max cap.\n\nThis does not apply to USDC, FRAX OR DAI at this time due to adequate liquidity on Arbitrum.",

However, these three tokens each has at least $5.9M liquidity on-chain, and SPA only has around $450K at the moment. Low on-chain liquidity has been a known issue for the SPA token, many investors hesitated to invest in SPA, and low on-chain liquidity has been their main concern.

      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Team\nReference: Recent AMAs\nCreated: 9/24/22\nLabels: #LiquidityMining\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nAfter a successful token swap, the recently acquired SDL will be used to redirect SDL emissions to the USDs pool on [Saddle Exchange](https://saddle.exchange/#/). A reduction in SPA emissions on the pool can maintain a constant TVL thanks to the new SDL emissions. The proposal suggests extending the farm until new SDL emissions are added, at which point the rate will be reduced by 50%.\n\n## Abstract\n\nExtend the USDs farm on Saddle with its current emissions rate of 111.111K SPA/day, funded by the Bootstrap Liquidity budget. This emission rate will last until October 7th. After October 7th the SPA emission rate will be reduced by 50% and subsidized with new SDL emissions.\n\n## Motivation\n\nReduce liquidity bootstrapping burn rate: Once the SDL is emitting starting October 7th, reduce SPA emission rate by 50%.\n\n## Overview\n\nSperax executed [a successful token swap with Saddle Finance ](https://twitter.com/hedgeyfinance/status/1567870850187018240). The purpose of this swap was to give each respective group governing power in the others ecosystem by staking the tokens. The 2,000,000 SDL will staked and used to redirect as many SDL to the USDs pool on Saddle as possible. Additional SDL which will be emitted to the pool after our participation in the [Minichef Reward Allocation vote](https://snapshot.org/#/saddlefinance.eth/proposal/0xd424d467ac93c89f9a856abce690577b22bc89f6472445a6f60143f16ce75ba1). The upcoming vote is for emissions which will start on October 7th.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nContinue the USDs Saddle farm in its current iteration. 111.111K SPA/day in rewards to be supplied from the Bootstrap Liquidity budget until October 7th at which point the emission rate will be reduced to 55,555 SPA/day until another governance proposal suggests otherwise.\n\n## Voting\n\nYes: Approve continuing USDs Saddle farm, reduce by 50% on October 7th\n\nNo: Reject continuing USDs Saddle farm",

      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Team\nReference: N/A\nCreated: 9/12/22\nLabels: #Other #Yield-Strategies\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nAs multi-strategy collateral deployment capabilities are being built out, the majority of USDC sits idle in VaultCore, which can be deployed to generate yield. An increase from 50% to 80% USDC allocation in stargate will increase protocol revenue until the upgrades are finished and tested.\n\nThis revenue will fund a higher Auto-yield rate and greater SPA buybacks and burns.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe last Auto-Yield distribution was just over 4%. As USDs adoption grows, ideally this rate is closer to the max rate of 11%. Increasing USDC allocated to yield generating strategies from 50% to 80% will allow the protocol to generate revenue in the short term while the necessary upgrades are coded and tested to allow for one collateral type to be deployed into two different yield strategies.\n\nIn the meantime, Sperax community and team can start promoting the opportunity to gain gas-free yield by minting USDs with FRAX, DAI and VST. This will reduce the protocol’s reliance on USDC / Stargate for yield generation.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIncrease Auto-Yield and Staking APR during upgrade process.\n\n## Overview\n\nCommunity members may have noticed the lower Auto-yield rate and Staking Yield of ~4% and ~51% respectively. This was rooted in the fact that 50% of all collateral is sitting in the VaultCore. The stablecoin collateral in VaultCore is redeemable, but does not earn yield.\n\n  \n    \n![6F1jVT-GmpdMFyZn-9Xe1gasG5LeOPiQ_ChCA2jAvJbROe0bpXB9RHHu2UVmXofRKWMIuaZyR6WhpHZ4GKuV6xTR_HX2wf9mrksGPwzlVT2OQApsZPmz-R57NnZd5FUnhYehGFXRqkXM5co2QPvAHLmysX7rsqXExjAG58Ct3u0nXg8wEeRITdvFOw (1).png](ipfs://bafkreibff6s3sdlt5ow7fdrcjlxzq56lqtlumspictipnkgsjm73ecouoa)\n    \n    \n\nAt the time of writing this, community members have deposited $4.975M worth of stablecoins to mint USDs:\n\n* 3,747,000 USDC\n* 25,112 DAI\n* 705,000 FRAX\n* 498,198 VST\n\nOf the nearly $5M stablecoins, 2.7M are sitting idle inside VaultCore. This was the root cause of the lower Auto-Yield APR and lower staking yield this past week.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nGetting to 80%: To achieve the 80% ratio of USDC deployed in Stargate vs in VaultCore, USDC will be sent from VaultCore to the USDC Strategy Contract right after this proposal passes.\n\nStaying around 80%: This ratio will be rebalanced to 80% weekly depending on minting and redeeming of USDs using USDC.",

      "title": "SIP-10: Decrease Protocol Risk to Depegged Collateral Assets",
      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Team\n\nReference: N/A\n\nCreated: 8/22/22\n\nLabels: #USDs Parameter, #Other\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nWhile accepting various forms of collateral for minting USDs makes minting more accessible, it also has the potential to open USDs up to unforeseen risks. This proposal seeks to minimize these marginal risks to further bolster the resilience of USDs by having the ability to swap collateral in the VaultCore or in strategies which have depegged by more than 2% to the downside and not accept collateral for minting USDs which have depegged by more than 2% to the downside.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks to allow the foundation multi-sig to swap collateral from the VaultCore and/or from strategies that have degepped by 2% or more to the downside. The foundation multi-sig will only have the authorization to swap the depegged collateral for another whitelisted collateral. This SIP also proposes a smart contract mechanism that will not accept collateral for minting USDs are depegged by 2+% to the downside.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn the unlikely event that collateral accepted by the protocol should depeg, there is rapid action that needs to take place. USDs is 100% collateralized, this is an important feature that helps maintain the $1 peg. Although the currently accepted collaterals are non-volatile, it is not impervious to potential changes in value. Should a portion of the collateral backing USDs depeg, it will alter the collateralization ratio and create uncertainty. Should the stablecoin collateral depeg, a security mechanism can be installed to protect the protocol and its users. By allowing the Foundation multi-sig to swap collateral which has depegged by more than 2% to the downside, risks of a depeg by collateral can be minimized and further damage can be mitigated. This also keeps toxic assets from entering the VaultCore.\n\nPassing this proposal ensures that if this rare event occurs the Foundation will be able to act and according to the very narrow permission, mitigating any potential loss.\n\n## Overview\n\nAllowing the Foundation multi-sig to swap out assets which has depegged more than 2% to the downside and build a smart contract mechanism to not accept collateral which has depegged by 2% or more to the downside will protect USDs collateral and peg.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nPause minting USDs if the collateral being used to mint has depegged by 2% or more to the downside.\n\nAbility for the team to swap collateral in the circumstance that any of the collateral has depegged by more than 2% to the downside, swap only to approved collaterals.",

The USDs farm on Saddle currently has a total TVL of ~$800K at the time of writing. This farm has been used as a swapping method for those looking to acquire USDs, and also serves as a to LP USDs and earn yield.

      "title": "SIP-8: Decentralize SPA buyback process + add TVL booster",
      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Core Team\n\nReference: This proposal\n\nCreated: 08/22/2022\n\nLabels: #Product Features\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe SPA buyback contract decentralizes the SPA buyback process while adding a boosting mechanism to continuously grow USDs TVL with protocol revenue. Protocol revenue (yield from USDs collateral and USDs redeem fees) will be swapped for collateral used to mint USDs. The freshly minted USDs used for buybacks gets deposited into the Buyback contract. Any users or external wallet can sell SPA tokens for USDs using the buyback contract. SPA sold to the protocol is used for veSPA staking rewards.\n\n## Abstract\n\nCurrently the yield generated in the form of various tokens is used to buy back USDs from various decentralized exchanges, depending on reward token. Instead of buying back USDs, yield can be converted to collaterals which can be used to mint USDs. This will organically grow USDs TVL, forever.\n\n1. The yield is collected in multiple tokens through pool fee (USDC, FRAX, VST, etc) and farm rewards (like CRV, FXS, VSTA, STG etc.). This yield will be converted to USDs, then the portion of the yield that is used to buy back SPA will be deposited into the Buyback contract.\n2. Mint and Redemption Fee from the Sperax USD protocol is collected in the form of USDs. This component will be directly deposited to the Buyback contract.\n\nUsers and bots will be able to view the USDs balance in the Buyback contract and can sell their SPA tokens for USDs. Staking reward distribution happens every week and above steps are executed manually every week. So automating this process is critical and will save several man hours which the Sperax foundation can otherwise spend in building other critical product solutions.\n\n## Motivation\n\n1. Remove centralized vectors in buyback process\n2. Increase USDs TVL with protocol revenue\n3. Reduce SPA sell pressure\n\n## Overview\n\nBuyback Contract will have three main functionalities\n\n1. Swapping yield tokens to eligible collateral tokens (for minting USDs) using audited DEXesbased on the path of lowest slippage\n2. Mint USDs using the collateral tokens\n3. Allow users to buy USDs using SPA\n\nThe Sperax Dapp front end will have a separate page where users can see USDs amount in the buyback contract. They can buy the USDs using SPA.\n\nExample :\n\nSperax protocol deposits Frax and VST into the Curve pool and then stakes the LP token in the Frax gauge to earn FXS and VSTA tokens. Protocol earns FXS and VSTA token.\n\n1. Sell the FXS tokens for Frax using Fraxswap\n2. Mint USDs using the Frax collected\n3. Transfer the USDs to the Buyback contract.\n4. Deposit USDs Mint and Redemption Fees directly into the Buyback contract as and when they are collected\n5. Users can view the amount of USDs left in the contract\n6. USDs is bought by the users using their SPA and contract receives SPA against the USDs\n\n## Technical Specification\n\n### Conversion of Yield to USDs and transfer to the Buyback contract\n\n1. Yields generated from the strategies in the form of stablecoins (USDC, FRAX, etc) and reward tokens (STG, CRV, FXS, VSTA etc.) are converted to any of the accepted collateral types. The swapping algorithm will be optimized to minimize slippage while exchanging for the acceptable collateral.\n2. Use the collateral generated in step 1 to mint USDs instead of swapping them for USDs.\n3. Deposit the amount that is used to purchase SPA into the buyback contract and the rest of the USDs is transferred back to the USDs vault’s auto-yield reserve.\n\n### Discount parameter\n\nThe buyback protocol can have a discount parameter which will allow the protocol to sell tokens at a discount to the market price. Discount parameter will be set to 0 in the beginning and can be changed later on. In future, the community will have the power to increase the discount parameter to incentivize the buy back process.",

      "title": "SIP-7: USDs Curve Liquidity Experiment",
      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Core Team\n\nReference: Mentioned in recent AMAs\n\nCreated: Aug 22, 2022\n\nLabels: #LiquidityMining\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThis proposal is following up on the [governance post in the Curve forum ](https://gov.curve.fi/t/add-2stable-usds-frax-arbitrum-pool-to-the-gauge-controller/4006). This well received proposal confirmed interest from the Sperax and FRAX community for a USDs Metapool on FRAXBP Arbitrum. SperaxUSD to provide bribes at 88,888 SPA/day, each week for a 4 week liquidity experiment.\n\n## Abstract\n\nIn order to improve the user experience for USDs users and the greater Arbitrum ecosystem, $USDs liquidity must be on multiple DEXs. This pool will be a metapool on top of the FRAX base pool (FRAXBP) on Curve. If this pool doesn’t receive significant TVL or high economic activity, we can choose to discontinue the bribes at the end of the 4 week period.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurve is the foundation for stablecoin liquidity. Curve provides visibility to USDs and incentivizes liquidity through CRV, the DEX’s native token. This CRV allocation is purchased via the bribes to veCRV and clCVX holders. CRV incentivization would help deepen the liquidity of USDs and lay the groundwork for future collaborations with the FRAX protocol.\n\nSuch collaborations include:\n\n-Demeter pools\n\n-FPI as collateral in USDs\n\n-USDs FXS treasury swaps\n\n-Protocol owned liquidity programs\n\n## Overview\n\nUsing the bootstrapping liquidity budget, 88,888 SPA/day should create a pool with ~3M TVL according to the current trading price of SPA at 0.013. Thanks to the 100% backed USDs model, this increase in TVL directly drives value to SPA. In addition to the increase in TVL driving value to SPA, USDs becomes highly liquid on Curve, increasing user experience. This is a self reinforcing phenomenon because as the experience increases, TVL grows, which creates a better experience thanks to the TVL driving value to SPA. SPA goes up in price, pool rewards increase, and liquidity for USDs increases in parallel. Positive flywheel in action.\n\nThis SIP is suggesting a 4 week trial period where we test the weekly bribe of 88,888 SPA and resasses the bribing system at that point.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nBribe Size: 88,888 SPA daily (622,216 SPA weekly).\n\nFunding Source: Bootstrapping liquidity budget.\n\nFunding Duration: 4 weeks of bribes\n\nBribing Protocol: Voitum - Votium is an incentives platform where vlCVX and veCRV holders can receive compensation (bribes) from buyers interested in amassing voting power(CRV emissions).

      "title": "SIP-6: USDs mint/redeem updates, SPA Burn 2.0",
      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Core Team\n\nReference: Mentioned in recent AMAs\n\nCreated: Aug 15, 2022\n\nLabels: #USDs Parameter\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe Sperax core team proposes to remove the barriers to grow USDs TVL by making the mint fee 0%, remove the SPA requirement to mint and set the redeem fee to 0.2%. In preparation for the launch of the Demeter protocol, this upgrade will allow for partners to easily mint USDs, increasing TVL and lowering the barrier to participate for liquidity providers of the [Demeter protocol ](https://snapshot.org/#/speraxdao.eth/proposal/0x5d68f446f8ed1a4c9bf7c32ca83fc0d149bde8eb1edecfbd525be093b29c2e28). Demeter is the new protocol allowing Arbitrum projects to launch Uniswap v3 farms without needing to know how to code. This proposal includes a new burning mechanism to retain SPA supply reduction while retaining 100% collateral ratio.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWhen projects use Sperax’s new Demeter Protocol to launch trading pairs against USDs, this user needs to acquire USDs to seed against the community token. Once they get the USDs, they will deposit USDs + partner token in the Demeter Uniswap farm to earn SPA and the partner token as rewards. By making the mint fee 0 and removing the need for SPA in the minting process partner protocols will more easily spin up a farm. Removing the SPA component should increase the user experience by removing barriers to minting, increasing USDs TVL in the process. This increase in TVL will produce more revenue for the protocol , more auto-yield for USDs holders and should result in more SPA burnt through the Demeter Protocol, more SPA bought back on the open market and more revenue paid out to SPA stakers. The revenue from Demeter is used to buy SPA and burn it. This is done by requiring Demeter users to acquire and burn some SPA. As use of Demeter grows, the community can anticipate the SPA burn being greater than when SPA was being used to mint USDs.\n\n## Motivation\n\nMake minting USDs seamless so Demeter Protocol will increase USDs TVL and drive more value towards the SPA token. Reintroduce SPA burn through the Burn 2.0 mechanism.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Demeter protocol will reward any project that incentivizes a trading pair against USDs with SPA. This is similar to if Curve had their own stablecoin, the protocol giving a guaranteed amount of CRV, just for pairing against the Curve stablecoin. We will deliver this experience through Demeter, although the liquidity will live on Uniswap v3 for ease of use.\n\nTo remove all barriers for community members to provide liquidity, the Sperax core team proposes two changes to make it as easy as possible to acquire USDs via minting. By minting, users don’t have to pay the fees associated with buying USDs on the open market. These fees include: paying a fee because USDs is trading above peg, tx fees from Uniswap and slippage fees if the order is large. All of these factors prohibit the ability for partners and community members to seamlessly acquire USDs to deposit into the incentivized Demeter pool.\n\nRedemption fee of 0.2% is the lowest rate where the protocol can still generate revenue without presenting a large barrier to users. This rate can be adjusted by future SIPs, of course.\n\n## Burn 2.0 Concept\n\nStakers of SPA benefit from weekly yield payments, generated by 100% of protocol fees and 50% of all yield generated on the collateral backing USDs. The Sperax team proposes that 50% of the SPA from the weekly buyback be burned. We currently give back 100% of the fees collected and 50% of the yield to SPA stakers after converting them to SPA.\n\nThe proposal is to burn 25% of the yield component - so if yield is 100 USDs, the protocol buys SPA with 50 USDs and burns SPA worth 25 USDs.\n\nIn addition to the above SPA burn, The Demeter protocol will charge a small fee by retaining some of the LP transaction fees in future. The LP will be compensated with reward tokens so this fee won’t be felt by the LP. But for the SPA holder, this is very promising because this fee is used to buy SPA on the open market, to burn. These two burning forces could make SPA deflationary once again without forcing USDs to be collateralized by SPA. In the first version of the Demeter protocol, other protocols/projects which launch a farm will have to pay a fee in the form of SPA tokens which will be burnt.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nSperax team to update the following parameters to the below numbers:\n\nMint fee: 0%,\n\nRedemption fee: 0.2%\n\nSPA requirement in mint/redeem: 0%\n\nOne of the two following revenue direction updates:\n\n\n### Revenue direction 1 with Burn 2.0: \n\n100 USDs (from collateral yield) → 50 USDs to Auto-Yield reserve, 25 USDs buys and burns SPA,  25 USDs buys SPA and transfers to veSPA stakers.\n\n\n### Revenue direction 2 without Burn: \n\n100 USDs (from collateral yield) → 75 USDs goes to Auto-Yield Reserve and 25 USDs worth of SPA is bought and transferred to veSPA stakers.",

      "title": "SIP-5: Demeter Protocol POC: Deploy L2DAO/USDs Univ3 Farm",
      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Core Team & Layer2DAO team\n\nReference: n/a\n\nCreated: 8/8/2022\n\nLabels: #LiquidityMining, #Partnerships\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nSperax is building towards something big to bootstrap USDs adoption. Being the preferred stablecoin and yield automator on Arbitrum requires great liquidity, TVL, and partners in the ecosystem. The new Sperax Demeter Protocol is under construction - the final vision being a fully automated farming-as-a-service protocol built on Uniswap v3 and controlled via Sperax dApp.\n\nSperax has solidified its first partner to prove out the concept and demonstrate to the Arbitrum community the new ease of getting deep incentivized liquidity on Uniswap v3 without any engineering work. The Sperax Team is proposing the launch of a L2DAO/USDs farm, with SPA incentives, on Uniswap v3 using Sperax’s Demeter protocol contracts.\n\n## Abstract\n\nSperax is building farming-as-a-service tools for Uniswap v3. The intent of these contracts are to offer existing and new Arbitrum ecosystem projects the opportunity to launch a Uniswap farm without any engineering debt on their side.\n\nMore about the final protocol spec coming very soon.\n\n## Motivation\n\nUniswap particularly lacks infrastructure for new teams to navigate the engineering complexity of launching a Uniswap v3 farm. This results in Arbitrum liquidity being provided on Sushiswap even though it’s far less capital efficient.\n\nSushi holds over $100M TVL on Arbitrum and Uniswap holds only $77M. We believe this has to do with the complexities of building on Uniswap V3. With the introduction of the Sperax Demeter Protocol, all Arbitrum projects can benefit from Uniswap v3 liquidity in a nearly no-code environment, even easier than deploying on Sushiswap.\n\nThe partnership with Layer2DAO will act as a proof of concept, proving to the Arbitrum ecosystem that users don’t have to be an engineering expert to spin up a Uniswap v3 farm.\n\nSecondly, this trading pair will increase USDs TVL, the cornerstone of the growth within the Sperax ecosystem. Increasing TVL means more collateral is working in DeFi strategies to fund Auto-Yield, increase revenue sharing with veSPA stakers…\n\nLayer2DAO is an ideal partner for this Demeter protocol proof of concept as they wish to match contributions and execute a token swap with the Sperax Foundation.\n\n## Overview\n\nTo prove out the new Sperax Demeter Protocol, Sperax will partner with Layer2DAO to spin up an incentivized Uniswap v3 Farm, pairing Layer2DAO token against USDs with SPA and L2DAO incentives.\n\nLayer2DAO, which uses its Treasury to invest in L2 protocols and ecosystem plays, serves as a diversified venture fund for investors looking to gain exposure to the L2 ecosystem growth. It also provides liquidity, depositing, and staking, perpetually reinvesting proceeds back into the Layer2 DAO. They will act as marketing and growth for Sperax in addition to contributing to USDs TVL.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nThe L2DAO/USDs farm will be launched on Arbitrum Uniswap v3 using the Demeter Protocol contracts. An emissions budget has been set at 5,555 L2DAO tokens/day and 33,333 SPA tokens/day to this variable APR farm. Once launched, the farm will be implemented into the Sperax dApp UI. The duration of this farm is 30 days or until the launch of the fully on-chain Demeter protocol.\n\nFunding will come from the bootstrapping liquidity budget.",

      "title": "SIP-4: Deploy USDC to Stargate",
      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Core Team\n\nReference: Mentioned in recent AMAs\n\nCreated: Jul 27, 2022\n\nLabels: #NewYieldStrategy\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nSperax Core team proposes to introduce a new investment strategy for the fund: Stargate. This strategy will become the primary yield generation source for current USDC and new USDC deposits into the collateral fund which fully backs $USDs.\n\n## Abstract\n\nSPA stakers want the flexibility to deploy assets in the fund as they see fit. The fund will eventually have a wide range of strategies and collateral types to pick from. This proposal introduces a new strategy that sends collateral to a cross-chain liquidity protocol, Stargate.\n\n## Motivation\n\nStargate is offering significant rewards to users who deposit stablecoins into their cross-chain liquidity protocol. This new flavor of bridge is extremely secure and has deep enough liquidity to deliver an APR of around 6% during the bear market.\n\nOverview\n\nUSDC deposited into the fund to mint USDs will be sent to Stargate until otherwise specified in an SIP. After USDC is deposited to Aave based on SIP-2, the remaining USDC shall be deployed to Stargate. This process will be currently managed by the foundation multisig wallet. The foundation multisig will initially deposit 10% of the USDC from the vault and gradually increase it to 50%. The team will constantly monitor the liquidity in the bridge and make sure that the deposited collateral value is sufficient to mitigate any illiquidity risks arising out of the collateral composition in the Stargate bridge.\n\nThis strategy is currently returning 6.17% APR. This shall be sufficient to fund the 11% Auto-Yield target. Currently the ratio of USDs in wallets vs contract is nearly 2:1. USDs in smart contracts don’t receive auto yield. This allows 6% to fund up to 12% yield when the wallet to contract ratio is 2:1. \n\n  \n![233b0cdcb97d0c372d5a9f1d3aa3d780c15da84d.png](ipfs://bafkreifhiq2cbhunwhghlhet5oo2zhcpohu54m2iq46n2rwla7o47ftryi)\n    \n    \nThis pool has massive rewards which has attracted massive liquidity. Currently over 44M USDC resides in the pool. This offers us the opportunity to deploy capital from the fund into this pool without significantly diminishing APR. We are adding less than 10% to the pool, so the APR will drop less than 10%.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\n1. How does depositing collateral to the strategy work?\n\nThe contract sends collateral to stargate’s liquidity pool, which returns lp token for the liquidity provided (sTokens). Next, sTokens are automatically staked in the farm to generate STG yield.\n\n2. How does withdrawal work?\n\nThe withdrawal is also a two step process, triggered when a user specifies their desire to redeem USDs for USDC.\n\nStep1 → withdraw() sTokens from the farm.\n\nStep2 → redeemInstantLocal() removes the liquidity from the stargate pool.\n\n3. How do is the yield generated?\n\nTechnically: Transaction fees → Over time the value of sTokens will increase against the collateral. ex: Today we add 1000 USDC as liquidity, we get 1000 sUSDC back. After two months when we redeem 1000 sUSDC we get back (lets say) 1500 USDC.\n\ngovernance Token rewards → When we deposit the sToken to the farm we start accruing STG rewards (follows a variable APR approach).\n\n4. How do we sell the tokens to generate yield?\n\ni. Fees → Paid in USDC, swapped for USDs\n\nii. Governance token → We buyback USDs using 1inch from the STG earned using DEXs (STG > USDC > USDs).",

      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Core Team\n\nReference: Mentioned in recent AMAs\n\nCreated: Jul 20, 2022\n\nLabels: #LiquidityMining\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nRedirect 20% of daily emissions from the USDs - SPA farm to a new APR USDs - USDC farm.\n\n## Abstract\n\nTo ensure adequate liquidity for peg stability, the Sperax team is proposing to launch a new incentive for users to park liquidity into the USDs - USDC Uniswap pair on Arbitrum. Instead of adding to the daily emissions, we propose to redirect emissions from the existing USDs - SPA pool to this new one.\n\n## Motivation\n\nTo ensure USDs keep it’s peg, there must be adequate liquidity on DEX’s to ensure arbitrage is profitable. We could launch a new farm which would require additional SPA emissions, and potentially SPA sell pressure, or we could redirect from the existing USDs - SPA farm. We propose to redirect instead of adding to emissions.\n\n## Overview\n\nCurrently the Reward Rate for the SPA-USDs farm is\n\n1. For all users (lockup+no lockup) = 466.663K SPA/Week\n2. Additional reward rate for lockup users = 233.331K SPA/Week\n\n20% of this pool will be redirected to the new farm to incentivize USDs - USDC liquidity.\n\nSo reward rate for the new USDC-USDs farm will be\n\n1. For all users (lockup+no lockup) = 0.2 * 466.663K SPA/Week\n2. Additional reward rate for lockup users = 0.2* 233.331K SPA/Week\n\nNew reward rate for the existing SPA-USDs farm will be\n\n1. For all users (lockup+no lockup) = 0.8 * 466.663K SPA/Week\n2. Additional reward rate for lockup users = 0.8* 233.331K SPA/Week\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nSperax team will use the Multisig to redirect rewards from the USDs - SPA pool to the USDs - USDC pool. To fund this pool 20% of the daily emissions will be redirected from the existing pool to the new pool. There will be 93,332 SPA/Week going to all users and an additional 46,662 going to lockup users as a bonus. This number was calculated by taking the weekly reward of the current farm for all users 466,663 *0.2 and the weekly lockup bonus of 233,331 *0.2.",

      "title": "SIP-2: Deploy USDC to Aave + Whitelist DAI",
      "content": "Author(s): Sperax Core Team\n\nReference: Mentioned in recent AMAs\n\nCreated: Jul 12, 2022\n\nLabels: #NewAsset #NewYieldStrategy\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nSperax Core team proposes to introduce a low risk, low yield investment strategy to the collateral pool: Aave. The initial allocation will be 5% of the USDC in the fund (~$450k).\n\n## Abstract\n\nSPA stakers want the flexibility to deploy a wide range of assets in the fund as they see fit. The fund will eventually have a wide range of collateral deployment opportunities and collateral types. This proposal is focused on two low risk improvements to the fund:\n\n* Whitelist DAI as a collateral type for minting sperax USD\n* Allow team multisig to manually control deposit and withdrawal of collateral from Aave\n* Deploy 5% of USDC reserves into Aave\n* Deploy DAI deposits collected in the protocol into Aave\n\n## Motivation\n\nAdding Aave and DAI provides an extremely risk-off strategy for part of the fund. Assuming at least some of the diversified funds will be generating yield in low risk plays, Aave has proven to be the most risk-off as it shored the highest TVL/Time score compared to other borrow and lend protocols. More risk-on borrow/lend protocols can be added in the future, but Aave should be present as a risk-off alternative for capital allocation.\n\n## Overview\n\nTo kickstart the influx of new yield strategies, Sperax team proposes adding Aave as an investment strategy and DAI as a collateral type. All DAI deposited into the fund to mint USDs will be sent to Aave until otherwise specified in an SIP. This proposal also asks that 5% of current USDC in the fund goes to Aave to generate yield.\n\nYield is currently low as there is minimal demand for leverage. Interest rates offered to those lending stablecoin on Aave can be expected to increase when demand for leverage increases. This happens most during upward trending markets. Yield is also low because this is an extremely safe protocol with low risk. Reduction of risk implies a reduced fee paid to those taking it, and lower interest rates. Even though rates are low, such strategies are needed to hedge off risk. DAI and Aave are #1 and #3 most secure according to the TVL/Time metric. This metric considers the amount of money the protocol manages but considers time as a variable. If a protocol gets to $1B TVL then gets rugged, it’s not as safe as a protocol that’s held $1B for a year without exploit. Maker and Aave score 6852.9B and 5704.9B respectively. Sperax would propose to add #2 most secure, but Curve is already integrated.\n\n \n![qlBPHwTDttdJOzqhvCZ8npqoAYrgjhhvl0T0aolAIzaUWdjlwmpqAI8DtG3dWRGwa9ugYuLQaVPhhmz5ZwUYF4NJx81FpEQwqgI1SrDGQZLAjIID4Mhy_ufX82-CkOQzqcmT5Gjiq6qW5Hzi2Rq4H_U.png](ipfs://bafkreiea73xepljnyws6igaktapaq3v4kn4phaldopeuolyeo5hwfttqee)\n    \n\n## Technical Specification\n\nWhen sent to AaveDoes the collateral get withdrawn from Aave when users redeem and in what conditions does that get redeemed? For example does it only withdraw collateral from Aave when the vault has run out of that collateral?\n\nScenario 1: USDs redemption\n\nThe contract will first try to use the collateral sitting in Vault. If Vault does not have enough, then the contract will try to withdraw the remaining amount from AAVE (and use all in Vault). If Vault + AAVE do not have enough, the txn will fail.\n\nScenario 2: Collection of interest\n\nCollecting interest happens at rebase, and it is accomplished via withdraw/redeem from AAVE. Over time our collateral balance in AAVE increases, and at rebase we collect those new collaterals as interest.\n\nScenario 3: Admin action\n\nSperax multisig has a function to manually withdraw collateral from AAVE and send it to the Vault, but only to the vault. This function won’t be triggered unless there is an exploit of AAVE. \n",

      "content": "Title: SIP-1: Diversify out of USDT into FRAX and VST\nAuthor(s): Sperax Core Team\nReference: Mentioned in all recent AMAs\nCreated: Jul 11, 2022\nLabels: #New-Assets, #Yield-Strategies, #Other\nSimple Summary\nSperax Core team proposes to execute on-chain swaps, diversifying away from USDT into FRAX and VST. This new collateral can be deployed to the VST+FRAX 3 Arbitrum Curve pool to farm FXS and VESTA 4 at over 20% APR.\nAbstract\nDiversifying away from USDT will protect USDs from the USDT depeg while offering new yield opportunities. The yield that funds USDs Auto-yield and the revenue split for SPA stakers.\nMotivation\nToday, USDs’ collateral composition is 56.61% USDC and 43.38% USDT. Currently all yield is generated on the Curve 2Pool. This pool has a low yield and exposes the protocol to a USDT depeg.\n \n![Picture1.png](ipfs://bafkreibif6w4tp7l6cg47gdrhoktate56gzleil5nvpsrwsbkqj2mudyfu)\n\nA USDT depeg would likely result in users doing one of two things, depending on where the collateral is:\nIf collateral is farming in Curve, rational LPs withdraw all USDC from the 2Pool, leaving SperaxUSD protocol holding an LP token of a pool that is 100% USDT.\nIf collateral is in VaultCore, rational users redeem USDs for USDC, leaving the protocol holding only USDT as collateral.\nIgnoring depeg risk, Curve 2pool is only returning 2% due to the decrease in CRV price. This cannot sustain the Auto-yield rate of 11% nor provide any revenue to the protocol.\n\n \n![Picture2.png](ipfs://bafkreiekartahq56m7zwuaocggg4qfy44krs5zkp2behasvw4omi3wbswu)\n\nOverview\nTo mitigate the USDT depeg exposure, while unlocking new yield strategies, Sperax Core team proposes a USDT swap over 7 days (sooner if liquidity permits). The 7 day window is to ensure we don’t experience slippage. Auto-yield would stop during this time as the collateral won’t be generating yield and CRV reserves are exhausted. Collateral is currently in the VaultCore, waiting to be swapped or deployed.\nThe VST/FRAX pool is currently generating 28% APR paid in VESTA and FXS. The pool’s TVL is 7.433M, this implies that the liquidity is sufficient to support our intended deposit of $3.43M.  Rewards will be collected and sold until a new proposal specifies otherwise.\n \n![Picture3.png](ipfs://bafkreicsxatjphk3uacr4tyfd5bza2rg5ojyofwmt4dt6lytus6hg65b4y)\n\nTechnical Specification\nAdd a function allowing the multisig to swap only USDT from VaultCore. Currently there is no ability for the multisig to move VaultCore funds except to deploy for yield via the strategy contract. If SIP-1 passes, this function will grant access for the multisig to execute swaps of only USDT.\nThe Sperax team can then diversify away from USDT without giving the multisig the ability to touch other collateral types. During the swapping process, the protocol will not generate yield, consequently no Auto-yield distributions would occur.\n\n    \n    \n    ",
