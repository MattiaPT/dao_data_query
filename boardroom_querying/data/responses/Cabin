      "title": "Neighborhood Accelerator Marketing",
      "content": "## 1. TL;DR\nFunding for the creation of content marketing to support the fall neighborhood accelerator cohort.\n\n- Produce content and encourage cabin neighborhood accelerator participants to share user-generated content. This project will create engaging narrative arcs that highlight community life and promote neighborhood building across social media.\n- Provide additional support as an accelerator facilitator under Savannah’s direction\n- Drive registrations to the fall cohort\n\n## 2. Team\n**Sponsor:** Jon Hillis\n**Steward:** Graham McBain\n\n### More Context: Who is Graham?\n\n#### Personal Neighborhood Building Mission\nI have been building a community in my neighborhood in Carmichael, CA for over five years. I have a deep passion for neighborhood-building work and serve as a mentor in the current cohort of the Neighborhood Accelerator program. I’m excited to tell the stories of neighborhoods that folks are building in our program in the hopes of inspiring more people to do this work with us in future programs.\n\n#### Past Experience\nI ran marketing for a cohort-based accelerator program at Galvanize, a coding school in Denver, Colorado. I was able to drop the customer acquisition cost for new students from $1500 to $800 / person.\nI’ve been making content online for over 10 years. Most recently for my company Foreverin.space 1 I have been filming short-form content. I’ve established an efficient workflow that I’ll be able to apply to marketing the Cabin Neighborhood Accelerator Program.\n\n#### Alignment\nI’ve been building in crypto for many years and most recently have been very active in the Farcaster ecosystem. I currently run the /parenting 2 and /neighborhoods 2 channels and have built up over 100K followers personally on the platform.\n\n## 3. Goals\n### Objective 1: Content\nEstablish a comprehensive content creation process that collects and shares compelling stories from neighborhood accelerator participants and vibrant neighborhoods worldwide.\n\n### Objective 2: Results\nIncrease the number of applicants to the fall cohort by 10x and determine customer acquisition costs (CAC) for the neighborhood accelerator.\n\n### Objective 3: Infrastructure\nDevelop the infrastructure to run a modern marketing funnel, establishing a baseline CAC for the accelerator and future products.\n\n## 4. Key Results\n### Content:\n\n- Collect, edit, and publish user-generated content from all willing accelerator participants daily\n- Write the Cabin Newsletter\n- Produce and publish two pieces of short-form content per day and distribute across major social media channels including onchain social\n- Gather and share stories from one non-program neighborhood per month\n- Produce one piece of long-form content per week\n- Find opportunities for Cabin team members to be on podcasts of like-minded organizations\n- Produce at least 10 pieces of SEO-performing blog articles per month.\n- Run SEO backlink campaign\n\n### Infrastructure:\n\n- Cabin CRM refresh\n- Marketing automation tooling\n- Analytics/conversion tracking\n- Hootsuite type tool & web3 equivalent\n\nBe available to market the cabin org more broadly as needed!\n\n## 5. Proposed Budget\n**Total Budget:** $36,000\n\n- Salary Costs: $8K X 3 months\n- Outsourced Production Costs: (all outsourcing will be transparent and done at cost)\n   - $9K: Outsourced Editor: \n       - 2 shorts /day X $50/short x 90 days\n   - $3K: Long-Form Editing:\n       - Backlink outreach\n       - Software costs (CapCut/ChatGPT/etc…)\n\n## 6. Timeline and Deliverables\n### Month 1:\n\n- Begin collecting and producing user-generated content\n- Lead gen funnels, tracking setup and live\n- Written content published\n- Host weekly info session calls for prospective future participants\n\n### Month 2:\n\n- Add more content types\n- Produce and post one to two long-form videos per month\n- Begin backlink campaign\n\n### Month 3:\n\n- Increase posting frequency as applications to the Fall Neighborhood Accelerator draw to a close\n- Publish recap videos for each of the Summer Accelerator participants\n- Product a sizzle reel to promote the Fall Program",

      "title": "Meeting Cabin's Technical Needs",
      "content": "## TL;DR\n\nCabin's plan for 2024 includes a lot of technical work: app changes, citizenship minting improvements, necessary maintenance, [potential whitelabel efforts](https://forum.cabin.city/t/cabin-labs-proposed-bets/64#software-for-network-states-3), etc. Beyond this known work, we also need to stay agile and explore the space of possibilities that leads to Cabin's success. I started working on all of that when I joined the First Fellowship five months ago. Now that the fellowship is over, I'm submitting a proposal to continue to fund that work.\n\n## Team\n\n* Sponsor: [@grin](https://forum.cabin.city/u/grin)\n* Steward: [@grin](https://forum.cabin.city/u/grin)\n\n## Goals\n\nThe proposal includes three goals:\n\n1. Complete Roadmapped Work\n2. Map Out and Complete Future Work\n3. Maintain Cabin's Lead\n\n### Complete Roadmapped Work\n\nThe [winter roadmap](https://forum.cabin.city/t/winter-24-roadmap/104) has the following technical goals:\n\n> * 1. Make Citizenship Better\n> a. Develop City Directory\n> b. Improve new Citizen experience\n> * 2. Grow active Citizens\n> a. Reduce friction to become a Citizen\n> * 3. Improve data and analytics\n> a. Migrate DB to SQL\n> b. Create dashboards\n\nDoing this work well requires a deep understanding of web2 and web3 development, as well Cabin's specific needs. After working at the First Fellowship, I'm very familiar with Cabin's tech stack and have a clear idea of how to accomplish all these goals. In fact I've already started working on 3a since it is urgent.\n\n### Map Out and Complete Future Work\n\nExecuting on the winter roadmap above is the first step, but there's much more to do. I made several suggestions in my [network state conf debrief](https://forum.cabin.city/t/trip-report-network-state-conference/80), and I have others, like this: \n\n\n![](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/cabin/original/1X/c5e4b82b89c5d68093a4246bbffcde2542276773.jpeg)\n\nThe right approach will require paying attention to what users want and sequencing the work for maximum effect. I will work closely with Jon, other contributors, our citizens, and the wider Cabin community to understand what needs to be done, then do it.\n\n### Maintain Cabin's Lead\n\nBeyond shipping code, Cabin must successfully map out the  [idea maze](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze) between where we are now and the network city we want to create. While technical work will be the bulk of this proposal, I plan to spend some time strategizing with Jon, exploring new possibilities, connecting with others in the space, doing thought-leadery things (writing, podcasting, posting on Farcaster), and generally repping Cabin (as I did [in Amsterdam](https://grin.io/tns)). This has benefits in both directions: it helps us understand how we want to achieve our goals, and it helps others find us and collaborate with us.\n\n## Why Me\n\nThis proposal is a big ask. Why should Cabin trust me to do all this? First, because I was the First Fellowship tech lead for the last five months, so I'm very familiar with the tech and the team (and they with me). Second, I have lots of relevant experience. Before joining Cabin, I founded two successful companies and designed and built multiple widely-used products. I've also created adjacent projects such Vibecamp and FarCon, and have been interested in this space for several years now.\n\n## Proposed Budget\n\n1 year of funding for this work:\n\n* $200,000 USDC\n* 2400 ₡ABIN\n\nThis is a 20% reduction from my pay at the First Fellowship. \n\n## Timeline and Deliverables\n\n**Timeline:** 1 year, at which point the proposal can be reviewed and renewed as needed\n\n**Deliverables:** Cabin meets it's present and future technical needs",

      "content": "# TL;DR\nThis proposal’s purpose is to fund more podcast episodes and further position Cabin as a community where ambitious, thoughtful people reimagine how we live. The USDC costs per episode for this fellowship are 11% lower than in previous seasons to keep the team and budget lean.\n\nRebooting Campfire for another season has four complimentary goals. A longform storytelling platform allows Cabin to:\n\n1. Build partnerships with others reimagining how we live.\n2. Learn and adopt practices that have been successful for organizations operating in similar spaces to Cabin, which may inform experiments incubated by the recently-passed Cabin Labs fellowship.\n3. Further the Cabin story and build on our own narrative. Cabin is dynamic and multifaceted - it’s important that we have a platform to share the nuance of what we are learning and doing for a range of stakeholders.\n4. Grow the audience of people interested in building a network city\n\nEditorially, season three will pick up where season two left off - we can bring on guests that are pioneering new models for living.\n\nTo produce 26 episodes by July 1, we are requesting $28,860 and 1,170 CABIN\n# Team\nSponsor: Jackson Steger\nSteward: Jackson Steger\nMembers: Colin (aka prodcolin), contractors and other token holders like Philippe or Dino as needed\n# Goals\nWhat are the OKRs for this proposal?\n\n- Objective: Resume weekly episodes of Campfire for the first half of 2024.\n- Key Results:\n- 26 episodes released by July 1.\n- Each episode will come with a highly produced asset(s) for social media to be shared on the Cabin Twitter and Instagram feeds.\n- 100% increase in current Campfire listenership\n\n# Proposed Budget\nThe following budget (see image)  \n![Screen Shot 2023-12-03 at 3.45.26 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreiayi3ukjypp6joj3ftzfvwya2dlp6hocedl4eaaukc65yvkyffavi)\n    will allow for highly-produced, well-researched episodes to be created and released each week for six months. On a per episode basis, this has 11% lower USDC expenses and 63% lower CABIN expenses than the last podcast fellowship that the DAO approved ($1,110 now vs. $1,240 before and 45 CABIN now vs. 123 CABIN before).\n*Funds that are not spent will be returned to the DAO upon conclusion of the fellowship\n\n# Timeline and Deliverables\nOne episode will be created and released each week for six months. This will be completed by July 1st. One episode is already recorded and is ready to be edited. Upon a proposal passing, an existing list of prospective guests will receive invitations to come on the show. Other guests who have already agreed to come on the show will record their episodes. If any prospective guests decline their invitations, we will find other guests.\n\nIf our OKRs are met and the fellowship feels fulfilled in its work, it may request to renew its fellowship via another DAO vote next summer.",

This proposal will support small bets that help us become default alive and achieve Cabin’s vision of building a network of modern villages. The proposal includes three objectives:\n\n- Run Experiments\n- Refine Vision & Strategy\n- Keep the Lights On\n\n## 2. Team\n\nSponsor: Jon Hillis\nSteward: Jon Hillis\nMembers: additional contributors as needed\n\n## 3. Goals\n\n### Objective 1. Run Experiments\n\nValidate demand and test product offerings that help Cabin build towards a network of villages. An initial list of ready-to-go experiments & a backlog can be found here: https://forum.cabin.city/t/cabin-labs-proposed-bets/64\n\nEach bet listed here will be incubated by Cabin Labs for up to 3 months, at which point it will be spun out into its own proposal if it is on track to continue and reach its goal. We will start with small experiments to validate or invalidate each of these three paths, and double down on paths that result in sustainable revenue.\n\nCabin Labs will incubate experiments focused on the set of paths outlined in Fall 23 Product Directions: https://forum.cabin.city/t/fall-23-product-directions/22\n\nThe overall goal of Cabin Labs is to help promote high quality metrics-driven experiments for the DAO by helping new proposals get ready to operate independently as quickly as possible. As bets are completed, new bets will be pulled up from the backlog.\n\n### Objective 2. Refine Vision & Strategy\n\n- Talk to community members and product users\n- Write strategic memos to help define product direction and roadmap\n- Write proposals as needed and source contributors for them\n\n### Objective 3. Keep the Lights On\n\nMaintain infrastructure\n- Pay the bills & keep services running (app, CRM, email, blog, forum, etc)\n- Complete necessary database migration to keep app running (by Feb 2024)\n- Take care of DAO’s legal and tax needs (legal structures, tax filings, etc)\n\nManage digital footprint\n- Manage community gathering spaces (discord and discourse)\n- Manage social media (twitter & instagram)\n- Manage content (newsletter, blog, website)\n\nDevelop partnerships\n- Serve as the point person for inbound partnership requests\n- Source opportunities for new partnerships\n\nSupport proposals\n- Provide feedback on all proposals submitted\n- Coordinate execution of multi-sig for all approved proposals\n- Provide support and feedback for all approved proposals\n- Help hold approved proposals accountable to outcomes\n\n## 4. Proposed Budget\n\n1 year of funding for this work stream:\n\n$396,000 USDC\n12,600 ₡ABIN\n\nThis represents a >3x reduction in cash vs. the First Fellowship for the past year. At $99k per season for the next 4 seasons, this proposal provides the DAO with a baseline 7.6 year run rate of supported operations and experiments.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the intended use of funds, which includes a reduced contributor payment for Jon, a reduced contributor budget for experiment incubation, app support, and our digital / community footprint, a budget for community engagement incentives, and a budget for software, expenses, and operating costs to keep the lights on.\n\nSee full budget breakdown here: https://forum.cabin.city/t/cabin-labs/23\n\n## 5. Timeline and Deliverables\n\nTimeline: 1 year, at which point the proposal can be reviewed and renewed as needed\n\nDeliverables: Cabin continues to exist and finds a path to becoming default alive",

      "content": "In a step towards progressive decentralization, this is a proposal to add signers to the DAO multi-sig. The DAO multi-sig is currently a 2/3 signed by Jon Hillis, Dave Merin, and Zakk Fleischmann. If approved, this proposal would increase the multi-sig to a 3/5 with the following signers:\n\nJon Hillis\nDave Merin\nChalice Stroebe\nJackson Steger\nAlex Grintsvayg\n\nAll of these signers have a history of contributions that make them trustworthy stewards of executing the DAO’s proposals. Increasing the multi-sig from a 2/3 to a 3/5 will increase the security of the multi-sig by requiring more signatures while also decreasing the risk of compromise and burden of execution associated with any one signer.",

The goal of this fellowship is to develop a single small pod for highly efficient and effective service provider work within Cabin. \n\nWe are also requesting default-on funding for the fellowship at the same level for 1 year. This would mean that, while the DAO could revoke the funding before the start of each season, the fellowship would be funded by default. This will allow us to create more stability and certainty for fellowship members, which is one of our biggest bottlenecks to bringing on top-tier contributors.\n\nWe believe that fellowship requests (especially with default-on funding) should be granted sparingly by the DAO, but that this fellowship has earned the request, since it's made up of core contributors who have long-standing, trusted relationships of contribution within the organization. \n\nYou can detailed OKRs, implementation plans, and budgets for the fellowship here: https://app.clarity.so/cabin/pages/a63e9d91-acb7-458a-860d-bc5d0e7e1834\n",

      "title": "Use token thresholds and add delegation for future DAO governance proposals",
      "content": "## Background\nEach season, we review if our governance systems are serving us effectively and consider evolutions to the structure to better serve the needs of the DAO. After reflection among the city council and feedback received from the community, we believe there are some clear strengths and weaknesses to our current approach:\n\n### What's working:\n- Fellowships as semi-autonomous units of service providers helps more cleanly separate the work from other parts of the community & creates the space for multiple pods working on the DAO's goals\n- Quests with clear OKRs and roles within a fellowship has led to better outcomes for the DAO\n- Having a filtering mechanism for DAO-wide proposals keeps the bar high\n\n### What's not working:\n- The city council proposal approval process can feel intimidating and illegible to community members\n- City council meetings and elections creates too much overhead for a small organization\n\n## Proposal: use token thresholds for proposal creation and add delegation\n\nWe propose the following changes to address these issues:\n\n- Replace the city council proposal approval process with a 1000 ₡ threshold for submitting proposals to snapshot \n\t- Proposals submitted to snapshot should use the following settings:\n\t\t- Voting system: Quadratic Voting\n\t\t- Default choices: Hell Yes, No\n\t\t- Voting period: Now -> Now+5 days\n- Turn on delegation in snapshot, so that any ₡ABIN holder can delegate their tokens to anyone else for proposal creation and voting\n\nAdditionally, we propose that Phil Levin join the Cabin multi-sig, replacing Dave Merin. Dave has served on the multi-sig for the past year, and has other responsibilities outside of the DAO that require his attention. Phil is one of our strongest core contributors and a natural fit to take Dave's place. The multi-sig will remain responsible for executing transactions on behalf of the DAO and limiting the risk of malicious proposals and sybil attacks.\n\nAs with all governance iterations, we do not expect this to be a perfect solution that we will be able to use indefinitely. We intend to use this structure for the Fall '22 season and then re-evaluate as needed.\n",

Waiting to start editing until this quest vote is done.\nGoal is to release 12 episodes over the course of the 12 week season, starting in July and ending at the end of September/the first week of October.\n## Supporting materials\n[additional information about the scope, intentions, and specifications of planned work, including a breakdown of the quest into component bounties]\n### Editorial\nWhereas editorial for S1 focused on the tips, tricks, and tactics that decentralized orgs used to achieve ambitious goals, S2 offers us an opportunity to experiment. We will now explore the tips, tricks, and tactics for building (or improving) cities. \n\n\nQuestions this season will explore\nHow do we build climate-resilient local infrastructure?\nHow do we build green real estate?\nWhat are good frameworks to keep in mind when evaluating pre-fab projects?\nHow do you scale trust?\nWhy is now the time to build a city?\nWhat is the tech stack for a decentralized city?\nWhat models for governance should we have at the neighborhood level vs. the DAO level?\nHow do you seed a city?\nHow do you build out a plan and then execute on it?\nWhat is import replacement theory and why does it matter?\n\nEpisodes will be thematic to a particular topic or set of topics relevant to a city-building guest’s expertise. As much as possible, we will try to learn about other city building projects, especially ones that failed, and examine them as case studies to see what we can learn and apply as Cabin. \n",

For $20,000 USDC we will get:\n\n- Main logo placement in marketing and swag\n- A core room within the conference to run programming\n- Full freedom to decorate the venue space with swag, branded assets, posters, flyers, etc.\n- An appreciated shout out during our opening ceremony\n- Guaranteed tickets for the core team + to attend the event\n\nAs part of this plan, we would take over a room in the main venue space to run our own programming as a core part of MCON. You can see more details about our plan for the room here, in partnership with Coordinape and Gather (the team that put together DAO Camp): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wjd2KICDK__bVIR2liys_eBIRCr2ObtWcb4bb7wvPVc/edit\n\nWhile we are generally skeptical about event sponsorships, this one seems like a particularly unique and valuable opportunity because:\n\n1. MCON has built an early reputation as the largest and best gathering of core DAO contributors\n2. We are not just putting our logo on the event, but helping co-create and facilitate a core space within the event, in line with our brand and mission \n3. The cost is reasonable, particularly given the size and scope of the conference\n",

      "content": "Summary\n\nThe team proposes swapping $25,000 of $CABIN with five of the leading social token communities. This will have multiple benefits for Cabin, including diversifying our treasury, aligning us with leading social token communities, and improving DAO2DAO relationships.\n\nThe Cabin Treasury working group has been in talks with Treasury teams of these communities. We are seeking to build a long-term alliance among the leading communities in the sector that should bring Cabin opportunities for years to come. This initial token swap is step one.\n\nMotivation\n\nThis is an opportunity for Cabin to pioneer a D2D model with other leaders in the space. Participating communities include Bankless DAO, Krause House, Yup, DAOHaus, and Forefront. The following lists both immediate benefits and a few potential opportunities that could be spawned from such an alliance.\n\nBenefits to Cabin\n\nTreasury Diversification: We would diversify into 5 of the leading social token communities in one swap. Token swaps are particularly valuable in that no $CABIN would need to be sold on the open market (thus putting downward pressure on our token).\n\nCabin would be aligning ourselves financially with some of the leading social token communities. This should lead to greater collaborations and more opportunities for our community.\n\nCabin would establish metagovernance rights in the participating DAOs.\n\nCabin would be pioneering a new form of multi-DAO Alliances.\n\nFuture opportunities for collaboration amongst Alliance partners may include joining lobbying efforts, contributor sharing, collateralized loans, liquidity solutions, a joint VC fund, and more.\n\nSpecifications\n\nCabin would send $25,000 of $CABIN to a multi-sig wallet (of which we would be a signer). In return, we would receive:\n\n$5,000 of $YUP\n$5,000 of $KRAUSE\n$5,000 of $HAUS\n$5,000 of $FF\n$5,000 of $BANK\n\nTokens would be subject to a minimum of a 3-year lock.",

      "title": "Quests and City Council ",
      "content": "This is a proposal for a new approach to budget allocation, governance, and operations for the DAO. We view governance as an iterative process, and assume that this plan for Summer 22 will require further evolution in future seasons. See more about our governance philosophy, operational structure, and implementation plan for this proposal here: https://app.clarity.so/cabin/pages/69f2d829-f2cb-4fe7-b9a1-9800c069bbc9\n\n## Quests are:\n\n- How Cabin allocates internal resources in order to accomplish goals\n- Specific results that can be accomplished by a small group with scoped resources in a bounded time period\n- Organized around a discrete team (called a fellowship) with a clear leader or steward responsible for the outcome\n- A protocol for a bottom-up budgeting process (money in, results out)\n\n## How quests work\n\n- **The city council determines the budget** to be allocated to each upcoming season's objectives. These objectives are each akin to a grant round. Budgets are opened by the city council at the start of the season. Any unused budget at the end of a season is retained by the DAO. \n- **A fellowship comes together** and creates a proposal detailing their key results and budget request to the DAO. Most quests last between 1 week and 3 months. Quests can be completed by a single person or small group with a leader called a steward. \n- **Each week, proposals are reviewed by the city council** or its designees and feedback is shared with the fellowship at a live city council meeting. Proposals approved by the city council are submitted to the DAO for a vote each week. The goal of the city council is not to pass judgment on the content of a proposal, but to make sure that proposals meet these structural requirements: \n\t- complete\n\t- clear\n\t- actionable\n\t- applicable to a given objective\n\t- within the budget for that objective\n\t- not malicious\n- **The DAO votes on proposals each week** using quadratic multi-choice voting. Each proposal is tied to an objective, and once that objective's budget runs out, no more proposals for that objective can be approved. \n- **Budget allocations are transferred** to a multi-sig wallet for each approved quest. The fellowship is responsible for:\n\t- achieving its results to contribute to an objective\n\t- allocating funds to members of the fellowship\n\t- reporting back to the DAO about progress on the quest  \n- **Each approved quest gets a discord channel.** Quest teams are public and non-permeable. This means that anyone can see what a quest team is working on, but not anyone can contribute to a quest.\n\n## City council\n\nGreat things are accomplished by small, focused teams with clear objectives. In order to effectively govern itself, we propose that the DAO rely on an elected body of servant leaders to perform the following functions:\n\n- **Provide the mission and objectives for the season.** This is a bat signal for the DAO to organize around, expressed as a short written document. We've found that, in keeping with our culture, deep discussions at an IRL retreat tend to produce the type of strategic thinking necessary to set a good mission for a season. \n- **Provide a budget cap for the DAO to spend on each of the season's objectives.** This budget determines the \"cut off line\" for each objective for the season and the allocation available for do-ocracy.\n- **Coordinate the planning process.** The city council performs the administrative duties of managing budget proposals, making sure people are aware of deadlines, etc. \n- **Execute the multi-sig.** The city council is the on-chain custodian of the DAO's treasury. They are responsible for executing transactions to allocate funds.\n\n## Structure of the city council:\n\n- There are seven elected members of the city council \n- Each session of the city council lasts one season\n- Anyone who holds at least 500 ₡ABIN can self-nominate for city council elections. The city council will maintain a set of guidelines for city council membership.\n- Elections for each season take place near the midpoint of the previous season. Nominees are offered as options in a multi-choice quadratic vote proposal for DAO members. The top seven vote receivers among the nominees are elected to the city council. This election process will go into effect in Summer 22, for the city council term of the Fall 22 season.",

      "title": "Should Cabin increase our token gating threshold from 1₡ to 10₡?",
      "content": "This proposal seeks to increase the amount of Cabin required to be a member of the community from 1₡ to 10₡. This change will be implemented in our Discord server using the Collab.Land bot to verify community members’ ₡ holdings. \n\nWith Cabin’s growth as an organization and community, this token gating adjustment will set the Cabin community up for success in both the short and long term by providing the following:\n- Increase the utilization of the ₡ABIN token (not in the way it is fundamentally utilized, but in that people will need to buy/earn and hold more ₡) \n- Prepare for more members to interface IRL with our new neighborhoods\n- Increase buy side pressure on the ₡ABIN token\n- Create a higher bounty amount for those new members looking to earn their way into the community. This will also help us continue to encourage bounty amounts of at least 10₡ to minimize gas fees. \n\nNote - if you’d like to provide additional feedback on this proposal, please do so here: https://forms.gle/DyW8JdAiQLFApTiR8\n",

How do people join?\nThe Community Guild is as open as it gets! People join by completing the Onboarding Welcome Form, attending an onboarding call, and then onboarding to the guild. We recommend scheduling a time to chat 1on1 with at least two people within the guild to get connected to our current initiatives and quests and see where they can plug in. \n\n## Evaluation of last season\nLast season the Community Guild was born. Through tactical and quick moving iterations, organization, and people-centered stewardship, we established ourselves as the backbone and cultural hub for the DAO. The great thing is that the fun has just begun….\n\n### Three badges we hold on our Season 2 passport: \n- Hosted and Created First Ever Guild Games \n--- A brainchild of the newly formed Community Guild, these week-long games were a fun and competitive way to end our season and look ahead to Season 3. Congrats again to the ~Product Guild~ All we will say is that you are lucky that the Community Guild was unbiasedly moderating the games. \n- Built Onboarding Flow\n---Through the creation and implementation of multiple surveys, calls, and meetings, we onboarded hundreds of people to the DAO. We received over 300 responses on our onboarding Welcome Form and hosted 20 group and individual onboarding calls. \n-Creation of the Guild Liaisons Role\n---Formed out of a need to deepen the second phase of community onboarding, we piloted these roles as a way to take stress off the guild facilitators and have another welcoming smile when you enter the DAO and our guilds.\n\nIn addition to the above quests, we had six KRs\n- Host five IRL event and host seven virtual events separate from weekly community calls, core contributor calls, and campfires.\n---This KR was achieved. In the end, we hosted several dozen virtual events in addition to the requisite IRL events - many of them happening during Guild Games alone. ✅\n- Help 50 new members across the DAO complete a bounty in season two.\n--- It is unknown if this KR was achieved exactly. 188 bounties were completed before the end of S2. It is hard to measure exactly how many people contributed. Our Clarity quest for this season should help make this more clear. ﹖\n- Create and iterate on a centralized onboarding hub complete with links, videos, and other information helpful for folks new to CABIN and web3.\n--- This KR was achieved ✅\n- Create standard operating procedures for hosting onboarding calls.\n--- This KR was achieved ✅\n- Host an end-of-season post-mortem call to determine the best activation, engagement, and retention metrics for future community seasons to track.\n--- This KR was achieved through two routes. We hosted a 360 Feedback process with all of the core contributors and solicited form fill outs from the community. We also started reporting weekly metrics. ✅",

      "title": "Product Guild Season 3 Proposal",
      "content": "## Purpose of the Guild\nThe objective of the Product Guild is to build and ship high-quality products for decentralized cities. You can think of it as building the digital infrastructure for a digital-native city.\n\n## Who will serve on the City Council representing the Guild?\nThe City Councilor for the Product Guild will be 0xZakk, Steward of the Product Guild.\n\n## What are the Guild's goals for the season? What metrics will the Guild track?\nThe Product Guild is currently supporting four key initiatives:\n1. Growing Guild Membership - increasing the number of contributors/bounty hunters in the Guild\n2. Project Aspen: City as Protocol - The decentralized, on-chain protocol that governs nodes in the Cabin network\n3. Passports - The protocol for citizenship and meaning in Cabin\n4. Blaze - The digital schelling point for DAO operator excellence (the persistent  URL equivalent to DAO Camp)\n\nEach of the above initiatives will take on a high-level objective supported by specific key results.\n\n- Growing Guild Membership ($500 / ₡1,000)\n    - Season 3 Objective: Improve and grow the guild as a place for engineers, designers, and product managers to contribute to the DAO\n    - Key Results:\n        - Publish a formal goal setting and sprint process, likely using Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)\n        - Make product updates transparent and more easily understandable across the DAO. In a survey of 20 DAO members at the end of the season, 15 (75%)  should agree or strongly agree that they understand what the Product Guild is working on. \n        - 50 people are members of the product guild by regularly contributing to products and other initiatives across the DAO\n- City as Protocol ($1,100 / ₡4,000)\n    - Season 3 Objective: Research and Develop a strategy for building a decentralized city protocol\n    - Key Results:\n        - Publish a specification on a protocol for expanding our network of nodes around the world\n        - Deploy 3 prototype TCR implementations\n- Passports ($900 / ₡3,000)\n    - Season 3 Objective: Launch v1 of the product\n    - Key Results:\n        - Conduct 20 user interviews on the product to determine update and improvement priority\n        - Launch 5 features to improve the utility of the product\n        - Issue at least 50 stamps from the different Guilds within Cabin\n- Blaze ($400 / ₡1,500)\n    - Season 3 Objective: Validate the value proposition of Blaze to the Cabin and broader DAO ecosystem\n    - Key Results:\n        - Conduct 20 user interviews to align with users on the job to be done\n        - Test and develop 5 prototypes of new Blaze features\n        - Grow MVP to 50 users contributing 25 links per week\n\n## Guild Budget\n\nThe Product Guild is requesting $22,100.00 and ₡9,980.00 to accomplish the objectives described above.\n\n[Estimated budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZpRI9q1gBvA5HsMOx9B9ADVwBsmWuQ-gUNG_xcoOEnc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Evaluation of last season\n\n✅ Passports\n\nThe goal this past season was to launch and MVP of Passports that would let us mint NFTs. This we did accomplish. While the product isn’t as mature as we set out and we haven’t done as much user testing as we would have liked, it is launched and available to use.\n\n✅ Blaze\n\nThe goal for Blaze this past season was to launch an MVP so that we could start testing the product. This we accomplished.\n\n🛑 Decentralized Product Process\n\nThe goal was to create a process by which anyone could propose a product to the Guild and have it funded. We did make substantial process on this in The Grand Theory of Product but made the decision to stop focusing on this for now. This will either be something we start when we have more traction or this will be something that becomes part of the DAO operating system and so won't need to be part of the Product Guild operating system.\n",

      "title": "Governance proposal: Expand Phil’s role",
      "content": "\nThis is an addendum to my current role as Placemaker.\n\nI am proposing a full-time (100%) role at Cabin joining Zakk and Jon in the Meta Guild.\n\nThis whole experience has opened my eyes as to how organizations could run in an abundant, open, autonomous, and decentralized world. And I want to make a bigger commitment to it.\n\nI would continue my role as Placemaker (40%) and add an additional 3 days per week of work within the Meta Guild (60%).\n\n== Placemaker (existing - 2 days per week) ==\nMy role as the delegate of the Placemaker Guild would continue as is.\n\n== Meta Guild work (new - 3 days per week) ==\n\nMy goal within the Meta Guild will be making Cabin the most effective, joyous, and rewarding DAO in the Web3 ecosystem. This includes a) the DAO attracting, retaining, and getting the best work out of contributors b) the DAO setting an example for how a high-performing decentralized organization can function c) setting up the organization to best serve our mission of building a decentralized city.\n\nThe trad analog might be something along the lines of “COO.”\n\nWhat I’d try to tackle this Season in the Meta Guild:\n1) Discord structure & norms: How do we maintain a joyous and productive Discord filled with juicy warm Cabin vibes?\n2) Compensation: How do people earn in the DAO? How do we get more people making a living independently online? How do we award outsized contributions? How do we evolve the bounty system so that it's a fair and consistent way to earn?\n3) Prepping for the onslaught: What do we do when we have our “Vitalik wrote about us” moment and people come streaming into the Discord? What switch do we need to hit to batten the hatches and have this be a positive rather than negative event within the DAO?\n4) DAO Participation Dashboard: How do we measure whether we are succeeding in being an open, welcoming community that people want to be a part of? How do we measure the funnel of people coming into the Cabin Discord? As part of this, I’d like to build a contribution/engagement analytics system (i.e. people analytics). I’d like to create systems that hold us accountable toward improving these metrics every week/month/year.\n5) Governance thresholds: How do we put the appropriate level of governance against any given decision? What types of decisions should be Snapshot governance proposals? What type of decisions should be less severe? How can people know the difference to empower them to get the right amount of buy-in to move forward? [and how do we allow for legitimate dissent...]\n6) Budget process: How do we assign budget (Cabin + USDC) to the various Guilds or other efforts? How do we give community members tools and voice to hold the budget recipients accountable?\n7) Progressive decentralization: How do we progressively empower Guilds and Sub-Guilds? How do we create an ecology of internal cultures at Cabin?\n\n== Qualifications ==\n\n=Experience within Cabin=\n- Cabin’s first core contributor and Guild delegate.\n- Created and grew the Placemakers Guild, which is central to Cabin’s vision to be an Embassy for DAOs.\n- Designed the existing bounty system within the DAO.\n\n=Experience starting and caretaking decentralized organizations=\n- Have founded three intentional communities (2 purchased, 1 leased) - RGB, Radish, and Duck Cloud.\n- Helped start and grow Preservation Society - a Burning Man camp with over 300 members\n- Write Supernuclear a blog on how to create and manage intentional community\n\n=Experience with the future of cities=\n- Founding team of Culdesac - building the first post-car neighborhood in the US.\n\t- Drove financing, legal structuring, and brand for $170m, 1,000 person ground-up development in Tempe AZ.\n- Advisor/consultant to Kift\n\t- Created the business model and go to market plan for Kift's \"decentralized city\" based on camper vans\n\n== Position length ==\n\nI am requesting this as a 1-year position (Feb 1 2022 - Jan 31 2023) broken up by a 2-month paternity leave (uncompensated) in the May - September timeframe.  (note: This is not meant to be a precedent on leave, others may make different requests).\n\nThere will be a DAO-wide review at 4 months to ensure everyone is satisfied with the arrangement and if there are any adjustments needed. At this point, the DAO could vote to pause the agreement. \n\n=Compensation=\n\nI am requesting 500 Cabin per month direct compensation. I would like to take up to 50% in USDC. \n\nIn addition, I am requesting a time-locked token grant of 750 Cabin per month.  Here’s how the time-locked grant would work: \n- The token grant would vest each month (750 Cabin) that I continue to be in a full-time role with Cabin.\n- This token grant is meant to reflect a role alongside Zakk and Jon in the Meta Guild helping to coordinate the activities of the DAO as a whole.  \n- The tokens would be time-locked and unlock on a rolling basis 2 years after being issued. While they are locked, I can’t transfer them or sell them. The time-locked incentivizes me to create long-term value in the DAO and stay heavily involved. \n- The Meta Guild (with me recused) would decide on behalf of the DAO whether I am still sufficiently active to justify vesting the grant each month. Members of the DAO can share concerns privately with any member of the Meta Guild if they think the grant should not vest based on my contributions.\n",

      "content": "The Community Guild facilitators (Jackson and JonDean) are proposing a budget of 639 ₡ABIN and $750 USDC to scale their ability to facilitate community within the DAO and create a world-class DAO onboarding experience.\n\nThe Community Guild is tackling three core initiatives in Season Two (through Mar 31, 2022)\n\n- Supporting ongoing Community Operations.\n- Building out the Community Onboarding Curriculum and Processes\n- Launching Social Clubs and IRL meetups\nDetails on emerging bounties and tasks can be found on the Clarity Roadmap and most clearly in this excel spreadsheet:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u7O8M1OxVb2tRXfezFRo7F84vqoOqmzgcFYDXzxu6tM/edit#gid=0\n\nThe USDC allocation will cover up to five IRL events as part of the Social Club initiative. Tentative event locations are Los Angeles, New York City, (Miami or SF), Austin, and Toronto. For each IRL event, we are budgeting $150 USDC.  Our goal is to host these events at locations free of cost and allocate the USDC to cover light food and drinks for attendees.  Leftover USDC budget will be reallocated to the ₡ABIN treasury at the end of the season. \n\nIn addition to ₡ABIN reserved for pre-determined bounties earmarked for particular initiatives, we are also asking the community for an additional 300₡ as a discretionary budget controlled by Jackson and Jon Dean. We recognize that emergent strategy is a pillar of past CABIN success and want to have the ability to quickly fund community-related tasks as their need emerges. Leftover CABIN budget will be reallocated to the CABIN treasury at the end of the season. \n\nObjective: Scale the community building team’s ability to facilitate community & connection within the DAO.\n\nKR 1: Host five IRL event and host seven virtual events separate from weekly community calls, core contributor calls, and campfires.\nKR 3: Help 50 new members across the DAO complete a bounty in season two.\nKR 4: Create and iterate on a centralized onboarding hub complete with links, videos, and other information helpful for folks new to CABIN and web3.\nKR 5: Create standard operating procedures for hosting onboarding calls.\nKR 6: Host an end-of-season post-mortem call to determine the best activation, engagement, and retention metrics for future community seasons to track.\nKR 7 (Discord - for social club initiative): Weekly communicators in discord & weekly messages per communicator (as measured by dividing total messages sent / number of weekly communicators)\n",

      "title": "Should we extend core contributor roles through the end of Season 2?",
      "content": "This is a proposal to extend existing core contributor roles through the end of Season 2 as described below. The goals of the proposal are to fund core contributor roles throughout Season 2, provide an off-ramp to core contributors who are choosing to end their current roles, and get all core contributors onto the same seasonal timeline for future renewals. \n\nAll proposed roles will be at the same terms as existing roles (pro-rated @ 500₡ per month for 100% commitment, paid up to 50% equivalent in USDC).\n\nHere are the proposed renewals:\n\n• @jon hillis — Caretaker: 100% time commitment (no changes)\n\nOriginal approval: https://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth/proposal/QmRw1z13s2ULL9vmK5iDt1kdygvcGkKF3s7Yke8SaKbj5s\n\n• @zakk — Guild Facilitator: 100% time commitment (role title change) \n\nOriginal approval: https://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth/proposal/QmRw1z13s2ULL9vmK5iDt1kdygvcGkKF3s7Yke8SaKbj5s\n\n• @phil — Placemaker: 40% time commitment (no changes) \n\nOriginal approval: https://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth/proposal/QmbmAcXJvnB7uQAXTGCLzhN71Y4xrZpAzbc96MPkM63KAn\n\n• @roxine — Media Guild Facilitator: 40% time commitment (role title change and increased commitment by 20%) \n\nOriginal approval: \nhttps://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth/proposal/0xf741163efe56754fb457fbccdf4b257b17c320024e7714c120f4cc0c7c907772\n\n• @dfmerin — Coin Alchemist: 20% time commitment (no changes)\n\nOriginal approval:  https://snapshot.org/#/cabindao.eth/proposal/0x266de7432a04d02088504829663ac783b04d7b8271dc26452c3c16fb251cfe68\n\nNote that two core contributors, @mel_being and @dug have decided to step aside as core contributors when their current term expires next month. Do not fear! Mel and Dug will still be here with us. As the DAO grows, they have made the thoughtful decision to continue working with the DAO as individual contributors earning bounties, instead of in a core contributor coordination role. Big ups to both of them for realizing what they wanted and manifesting the right role for themselves 😁 \n\nThe two other core contributors, @Jackson and @JonDean, will not be a part of this proposal since their more recent roles have already been approved through the end of Season 2.",

      "content": "Jon Dean and Jackson would like to propose co-owning the community builder role.\n\n## Role length\nUntil the end of Season 2 (March 31st) - extendable if everyone (including both of them) is still stoked.\n\n## Role Description\nCommunity builders act as the voice, tone, and internal moderators of the Cabin brand through community support, content circulation, onboarding, and digital engagement to build trust and to help provide members with a sense of agency to contribute to the DAO’s overall mission of building a decentralized city for independent online creatives.\n\nMost urgently, community builders onboard new Discord members and token holders so that they feel connected to the DAO, understand its systems, and are empowered to work on projects that excite them. This can be done for both Cabin and the larger web3 ecosystem.  \n\nBeyond onboarding, we curate culture by serving members’ needs, fostering a collaborative environment, facilitating connections, and moderating the community. \n\nSuccess to us means that members of Cabin are excited about contributing to the DAO ecosystem and are able to easily find the resources they need to do their work.\n\n## Core Responsibilities\n### High Level\n- Found & lead the new community guild\n- Issue bounties to help complete the other responsibilities of the role.\n- Moderate the discord server\n- Find someone within the DAO to lead social clubs and empower them to succeed.\n- Create thoughtful pathways for DEI\n- Onboard new members by\n- Designing an onboarding process from first principles\n- Creating infrastructure for multi-layered onboarding\n- DAO onboarding\n- Guild onboarding\n- Project onboarding \n- Adding a “reboarding” component to the onboarding workflow.\n- Working with the media guild to help members easily access, navigate, and digest useful resources.\n\n### Specific projects\n- Revamp discord structure and onboarding to create a choose-your-own adventure style of onboarding.\n- Implement bots and automation as needed\n- Work with the writers/media guild to make documentation super clear and accessible for new members.\n- Create structure for “Therapy” (office hours) for folks who have questions, want to voice an opinion, want to “reboard,” or need to be directed in a certain direction.\n- Identify and start measuring metrics that indicate the health of the CABIN community.\n- Integrate a web3 job board into a seamless workflow for fulfilling bounties \n- Develop and iterate on a process/regular cadence for onboarding new members every week\n- Building out a formal orientation framework with a “first day of camp” mindset\n- Build checklists (packing list!) for onboarding\n- Iterate on a scalable model for onboarding that becomes “multi-layered” and extends to the DAO, Guilds, and Projects\n- Social clubs entail virtual and IRL meetups\n\n## Qualifications\n### Jon Dean\n- 3 years as the Lead Brand Ambassador for Indego Bike Share. Focused on community engagement to bring awareness and accessibility to affordable and sustainable transportation options across Philadelphia \n- Philadelphia-based Compass real estate agent and investor focused on providing high-quality client experiences to residential and commercial buyers, sellers, investors, and renters. Served over 300 clients as a certified Green Realtor\n- Community advocate across numerous local Philadelphia orgs. Assisted with community engagement, lead stakeholder charrettes, sat on the steering committee for public space renovation projects, biking infrastructure improvements, housing/zoning policy meetings for RCOs, and helped distribute loan assistance programs in partnership with the City of Philadelphia to connect landlords with capital who were impacted by COVID-19 \n- Managed co-living experiences for a start up and assisted with real estate services and customer service relations\n- Managed 25-person staff and a fleet of 5 pedacycles over 9 distinct routes and oversaw customer relations for tourism company in Philadelphia\n- Designed, adapted, and led tour programming for potential students, community members, and visitors as a University of Wisconsin - Madison admissions tour guide\n \n### Jackson\n- Builder, storyteller, and technologist with eight years of experience working for early-stage tech, media, and international development organizations.\n    - Three years of participating, building & organizing in startup communities, including virtual onboarding of the 2020 Venture For America Philadelphia class.\n    - Currently building out an audio arm at On Deck - a community-first tech company.\n2018 Venture for America Fellow - fellowship for those who want to learn how to build a business while making an impact in an emerging US city. Training includes both hard and soft skills likely to be needed at a tech startup.\n    - Numerous other media-specific projects and leadership roles, read more here.\n    - Three years of Growth experience + leadership at a Philly-based startup.\n- Hosted the first half-dozen CABIN Spaces.\n- Joined CABIN during the first crowdfund over the summer.\n \n## Compensation\nCommunity-management is a 40/hour week commitment that Jon Dean and Jackson anticipate splitting 50-50 to start (with the possibility of adjusting that distribution over time). They are requesting combined compensation of 500₡ (or up to 50% equivalent in USDC) split evenly per month, up for renewal in 3 months. ",

      "title": "₡ABIN minting and treasury diversification",
      "content": "## Summary \n\nWe propose that the DAO mint 1,000,000 ₡ABIN and replace the current CABIN token. If approved, the DAO will distribute up to 21% to existing CABIN holders, swap up to 10% with strategic partners in exchange for $2,500,000 USDC, and hold the remaining portion in the DAO treasury.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe original CABIN token was distributed to serve as a governance mechanism for a 3-month experimental residency program for independent online creators. While this program has been a huge success, the token itself is no longer sufficient for the community that has grown around it. This proposal calls for a new token, ₡ABIN, which will allow us to:\n\n- Establish a larger token supply to account for the increased size of the community\n- Maintain more of the token supply within the DAO treasury to support future contributors\n- Diversify the treasury with stable assets that can be used to compensate community members\n- Allow the DAO to mint more ₡ABIN in the future\n\nOver the past month, we have discussed these goals extensively as a community and have achieved rough consensus  around the following plan. \n\n## Specification\n\nMint 1,000,000 ₡ABIN to replace the existing CABIN token (0x94515e4f6fabad73c8bcdd8cd42f0b5c037e2c49)\n\nDistribute ₡ABIN as follows (all remaining ₡ABIN not accounted for below will remain in the DAO treasury):\n-  Distribute approximately 11% of supply to existing CABIN holders\n\t- Existing holders are eligible to receive 3.2 ₡ABIN for each CABIN held as of the snapshot\n\t- Existing holders who participated in governance will receive an additional 10% compounding multiplier per governance vote as of the snapshot\n- Distribute 10% of supply to founders\n\t- Zakk (zakk.eth) and Jon (hillis.eth) will each receive 50,000 ₡ABIN, subject to vesting conditions\n- Distribute 10% of supply to strategic partners at an implied fully diluted token valuation of $25M \n\t- Execute a treasury diversification by swapping 100,000 ₡ABIN for $2.5M USDC into the DAO treasury\n    - The full list of participants, including dozens of operators from across the DAO ecosystem and community members [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q35NNXJpHsEbQjEsnBdYFxVSv1QyZ0JcKYwqMxlSRHo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\t- The largest participants in this treasury diversification (subject to vesting conditions) are:\n\n| Partner  | Allocation |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Multicoin Capital (Vishal Kankani) | 40,000 ₡  |\n| Awesome People Ventures (Julia Lipton) | 10,000 ₡ |\n| Seed Club Ventures (Nima Asghari) | 10,000 ₡ |\n| IDEO CoLab (Reuben Bramanathan) | 10,000 ₡ |\n| SHL Capital (Sahil Lavingia) | 4,000 ₡ |\n| El Cap (Kunal Tandon) | 4,000 ₡ |\n\n- Vesting conditions\n\t- The supply distributed to existing CABIN holders in exchange for ₡ABIN will not have vesting conditions\n\t- All remaining grants (founder + strategic partner) greater than or equal to 4,000 ₡ will be subject to a vesting period with 50% vested after one year and the remaining 50% vested after the second year from the date of proposal approval\n\n## Closing Thoughts\n\nThis proposal represents both an important moment for Cabin. It represents the impact we've had through our residency program. It also shows the strength of the community we've built: 42% of the contributors to the treasury diversification were existing DAO members and combined they are contributing 66% of the total funds. The most important thing this proposal represents is what we get to do next: build cool shit.\n\nYour vote is the most important investment that can be made here.

KPIs: Lolz and memes.\n\n## Core responsibilities (first 3 months)\n- Facilitate discussion and create alignment within the DAO on what we mean by \"decentralized city\" and how it might operate in practice.\n\t- How do the physical nodes interact with the online community?\n\t- How many nodes do we want over time? How will we acquire/finance/manage them?\n\t- How will the nodes be used in future seasons? Who gets to use them? What does Cabin DAO get in return?\n\t- What's the legal framework?\n- Break down plan into a series of Projects and Bounties for next 1-2 seasons\n- Establish norms of usage at Hill Country e.g. Welcome Guide for guests\n- Pursue further development of the Hill Country node (e.g. new cabins?)\n- Engage with other groups interested in creating physical spaces associated with Cabin network\n- Get our remaining Season 2 Passports sold\n\n## Qualifications\n\nI've spent the last 5 years using real estate to create community and belonging.\n\nCreative real estate development (day jobs):\n\n- Founding team of Culdesac - building the first post-car neighborhood in the US.\n\t- Drove financing, legal structuring, and brand for $170m, 1000 person ground-up development in Tempe AZ\n- Advisor/consultant to Kift\n\t- Created the business model and GTM plan for Kift's \"decentralized city\" based on camper vans\n\nIntentional communities (passion projects):\n- Have started 3 intentional communities (2 purchased, 1 leased) - RGB, Radish, and Hinterlands\n- Write Supernuclear a blog on how to create and manage intentional community\n\n## Compensation request\nI anticipate spending 40% of my time over the next 3 months and would request to be compensated 400₡ split 50/50  between ₡ and USDC.\n\n",

Each week we will have access to two 90-minute sessions, plus coaching, workshops and networking aimed at helping you shape and execute our social token project. \n\nSeed Club aims to create value beyond the 6-week program through participating and supporting our community. They take active roles in governance and endeavor to build a community that supports projects throughout the lifecycle of the project and beyond. \n\nIn exchange for participation in Seed Club, we would contribute 3% of $CABIN tokens to the Seed Club Treasury. Given the existing supply of $CABIN, this would mean transferring 1,079 $CABIN from Cabin DAO to Seed Club. In exchange for this, in addition to program and network support, Cabin DAO will be rewarded with membership  & ownership in Seed Club as well. ",

      "content": "BACKGROUND:\nBounties and incentives are a way for us to invest our token supply into our community as a means of growing it. We would like to propose a budget of 1,000 $CABIN that the DAO can use as discretionary spending for this purpose.\n\nSome examples of things we'd like to use with this discretionary budget include:\n\n1. A residency referral bonus\n2. Blog/article writing\n3. Bounties\n\nPROPOSAL:\n\n1. We propose a discretionary growth budget of 1,000 $CABIN.\n2. We also propose that this budget be spent \"at the DAO's discretion\" (so without formal voting). The process we'd like to follow is \"straw poll\" voting in Discord: we'll create a proposal as a message here in #governance. if people agree they should give a thumbs up on the proposal. if people don't agree, we have an open a discussion about trade-offs and alternatives. If we don't hear within 24 hours, then we proceed.\n3. Finally, We propose that this budget last until November 5, 2021 (approximately one week after the end of Cohort 3).",

Given the progress the community has made over the past couple of months, it makes sense for the price to have appreciated from the initial 1 ETH : 1000 CABIN ratio, though there is a question of how much it should have appreciated (e.g., 1 ETH : 100 CABIN = 10x increase, 1 ETH : 500 CABIN = 2x increase).  Of course, the market will bring this to equilibrium once the pool is launched.\n\nAs a first step, we'd propose to use 1 of the 3 ETH from the Treasury for this experiment and an associated amount of CABIN (currently 12k in Treasury).\n\nDo you agree with this plan?  If so, where should we set the initial price?",
