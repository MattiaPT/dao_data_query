      "content": "## Summary:\n\n* EarthFund DAO will seek to raise money from institutional investors.\n* EarthFund DAO will form a new Delaware entity (‚ÄúNewco‚Äù) through which the investment funds will be raised.\n* The investment monies will be used to continue the development of the Newco platform and further market EarthFund‚Äôs solutions.\n* EarthFund DAO will contribute assets (i.e., all intellectual property, including but not limited to brand, platform, and software) to Newco in exchange for 20% of the equity of Newco. \n\n## Motivation: \n\nIn the last quarter, we‚Äôve been meeting with investors intending to secure between $12M and $15M in venture capital to continue the development and growth of the EarthFund platform.\n\n**Conversations are heading in a positive direction, but to secure investment, they wanted to see three things:**\n\n* A team of experienced entrepreneurs, advisors, and team members that have what it takes to build a winning product. (We satisfy all criteria.)\n* A working product with a strong addressable market and functionality. (We satisfy all criteria.)\n* A roadmap for growth with no barriers to execution. (We have a roadmap and a clear strategy for growth, but we need to secure investment to really scale up our efforts and grow the team with the view of growing EarthFund into a billion-dollar company.)\n\nAnd due to the legal uncertainty of DAOs, the role of the EarthFund DAO was another barrier for investors. \n\nAs such, our advisors have recommended establishing a new company‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEarthFund Inc‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto own and control the assets and intellectual property of EarthFund. \n\nBecause we didn‚Äôt want to remove or reduce the role of the EarthFund DAO in the management of the platform, vetting causes and helping shape the projects/causes on the platform, we came up with the following solution.\n\n\n### **Our proposal for the relationship between EarthFund and the new company**\n\nThe management of EarthFund DAO proposes the following:\n\n* **EarthFund DAO will seek to raise money** from institutional investors.\n* **EarthFund DAO will form a new Delaware entity** (‚ÄúNewco‚Äù) through which the investment funds will be raised.\n* The **investment monies will be used to continue the development of the Newco platform** and further market EarthFund‚Äôs solutions.\n* EarthFund DAO has recently created and launched a DAO launchpad, KYC solution, donation router, grant/rewards contract, token minting tool, Discord bot, and more‚Ä¶ all of which enable prospective customers to launch a decentralized community without spending months or years developing their own platform.\n* **EarthFund DAO will contribute assets **(i.e., all intellectual property, including but not limited to brand, platform, and software)** to Newco in exchange for 20% of the equity of Newco.** (The remaining equity in Newco will be allocated to investors and to current and future Newco leadership as an incentive.)\n* **EarthFund DAO will receive common shares of Newco** with no voting rights except as described below.\n* EarthFund DAO management believes that the value of EarthFund‚Äôs interest in Newco (i.e., 20%) will far exceed the current value of EF DAO on a stand-alone basis.\n* EarthFund DAO and Newco will work closely together to maintain a fair ecosystem for DAO communities on Newco‚Äôs platform.\n* EarthFund DAO will receive quarterly shareholder updates from Newco\n* **EarthFund DAO will be responsible for the ‚ÄòBrowse Communities‚Äô** section of the Newco platform (what communities are included, featured, removed, etc.)\n* **EarthFund DAO will be entitled to their pro-rata share of sales proceeds if Newco is sold.**\n* **EarthFund DAO will receive its pro-rata distributions from the profits of Newco if Newco chooses to distribute profits (vs. reinvest).**\n* EarthFund DAO will have a vote on how it uses distributions or possible sales proceeds.\n\n\n## **Have your say**\n\nVoting to approve this proposal will allow EarthFund to seek the investment it needs to continue growing and developing the platform despite market conditions. \n\nIt is our goal to use the investment to grow the EarthFund platform into one of Web3.0‚Äôs biggest companies and aim for these stretch goals in the next 12 months: \n\n\n* launch 1000+ communities\n* Raise $100M in donations\n* Facilitate $5M in community rewards\n* Fund 20K+ world-saving grants\n\n### Voting approval can help us make these goals a reality. \n\nThank you, as always, for your support. \n",

      "title": "üåç EFP-1: change to token vesting contract ",
      "content": "Summary:\n\n‚Ä£ Protect the long-term goals of the project and restore trust in the community by locking team and private sale tokens.\n\n‚Ä£ Extend the vesting schedule for the EarthFund team and private sale investors from 1-year vesting to 5-year vesting. \n\n‚Ä£ Delay unlocking of locked tokens from 02/15/2022 to 11/19/2022, one year after TGE.\n\n‚Ä£ Combine all seed, team, and private sale tokens into a pool that yields monthly distributions for investors without negatively impacting the market.\n\nMotivation: \n\nOur initial launch on KuCoin opened 1Earth at $1.50, rather than our intended price of $0.005.  \n\nThis caused early open market buyers to overpay for the token, while also showing 1Earth significantly down in the price charts. In reality, it was just the opposite, with 1Earth up by 70x.\n\nOur team is working closely with the KuCoin team on possible joint solutions to address the impact of the technical issues from the initial launch. However, before we proceed, we need to proactively make sure that there will be no more block sales affecting the token price suddenly. \n\nLikewise, we think that a show of long-term involvement with the project to our community will rebuild the trust lost during the token launch and subsequent downturn. \n\nProposal: \n\nWe‚Äôre proposing using the model created by another successful token to protect the long-term health of the project and produce consistent distributions for our investors.\n\nThis would involve pooling all investment and team tokens into a liquidity pool that supports the security of the project and ensures optimal price execution.\n\nTo do this, we would amend the 1Earth vesting schedule to commence on November 19, 2022.\n\nAt this time, a trusted and vetted third party will act independently to liquidate the available pool of private tokens based on a percentage of the previous daily volume so it does not negatively impact the market. All proceeds will be distributed to investors proportionately according to their LP tokens.  \n\nThis liquidation will be done sustainably to protect the long-term health of the project, and is likely to result in 5 years of monthly distributions for you to collect from the EarthFund investor portal.\n\nTechnical information:\n\nThis change will involve the issuance of a Liquidity Pool token (1EarthLP) that will entitle each token holder to a pro-rata portion of the liquidity every month until all of the tokens in the pool have been sold.  \n\nEach month, investors will be able to connect their wallets to the token holder portal and collect EarthFund distributions in USDT (Tether).\n\nFor more information about EarthFund, please visit: earthfund.io\n",
