      "title": "Mirandus Proposal ",
      "content": "Proposal to spend between 18-21 ETH to purchase all the remaining assets needed to make our city fully self sufficient (with the exception of a Tannery, Clothier & Stonecrafter because these assets are priced extremely high on Opensea as they were never yet sold by GALA and only a few were sent out to Node holders so we feel we can get them later when they do eventually hit the store). \n\nWe have been watching prices closely and given that we have held most of our assets in USDC (while Ethereum plummeted), combined with gaming assets being down it is felt that it is a fantastic opportunity to complete our list. It should also be noted that the major towns like the Town of the Marquess have held their value throughout the ups and downs of the market with the floor on a Town of the Marquess just under $100K\n\nThe list of buildings would be:\n1x Potion Shop\n1x Brewery \n1x Butchery\n1x Mill\n1x Cemetery\n\nAs we;; as the two smallest ships:\n1x Picard\n1x Crayer\n\nSo that we can effectively use our Dock to sell our surplus goods and offer basic transport both for short distances and a faster larger boat for greater distances. The other three sizes of boats are significantly more and it does not seem sensible to make that level of investment (especially since independent captains will be able to dock at our harbor and so on).\n\nA full list of our holdings can be founder here (our website holdings section is in the middle of getting an overhaul) https://opensea.io/0x0f76470f64BAf2230c981A95bEA90Dc8532eF6e6\n\nPlease note we own a number of extra taverns as we hope to place our extra taverns in each of the kingdoms in order to act as defacto neutral zones, business points and embassies. We maintain good ties with the Town of the Arch Dukers, Winterfell and a few others and expect to setup formal alliances once we get closer to Mirandus opening.\n\nThe recent playtest for Mirandus was frankly excellent. I was able to actively participate and found there was no lag despite 55 other players being there with me and Goblins constantly spawning. You can see the test here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmUFqzO7JHw\n\nFrom the inception of this DAO many of us constantly raised pro Mirandus voices while also voicing concerns about some of the other games GALA was onboarding onto their platform. Objectively speaking there are indeed a number of concerns with games such as Townstar & Spidertank, however GALA always made it clear (if not clear enough) that they were acting as a platform akin to steam and though they offered assistance to the other teams creating games on their platform, they made it clear that they themselves were only building Mirandus in house at this time. It is also strongly suspected that Mirandus will not be fully developed for a year however, this is not really a new complaint as sophisticated game development always takes time. Mirandus co-founder has always implied they will be opening up the game in modules much like Illuvium & BigTime are doing as well. If anything the regular and increasingly better quality play tests are a reminder that they are working hard  and they continue to instill confidence in the major holders and guilds. Also Mirandus has raised an enormous amount of money (north of $250 million so this bear market will not stop them completing their work). ",

      "content": "Proposal to spend up to $20K on purchasing parcels next to the lands we own in order to form Megacities.\n\nDuring the initial Illuvium Land sale we were able to secure 6 x tier 4 lands & 3 x tier 3 lands. \n\nWe were able to purchase them all at great prices as we focused on getting the highest tier lands at the lower prices vs others who paid a premium (sometimes a large one) in order to get parcels next to their existing plots in order to form Mega Cities. They did so at the time of mint where as we hoped we could cherry pick at more favorable prices later.\n\nPlease refer to the DAO Proposal channel for a detailed discussion about Mega Cities but in short they are certainly lucrative. A Mega City is created by connecting for parcels that are next to each other but in the 2 by 2 ratio i.e. they form a square. They benefit from major production boosts and markets of scale. This is especially true if we can connect our Tier 4s to lower tier lands as we will be able to buy the lower tier lands at much lower prices and yet drastically increase their output due to their proximity to our landmark properties. \n\nThe governors propose that we set aside the funds to cherry pick these properties as they become available on the markett.",

      "title": "Otherside Proposal ",
      "content": "It is proposed that we take a modest investment position in Otherside by purchasing $20-$30K worth of high resource yielding deeds. \n\nThe governors have spent quite some time reviewing all we can find about Otherside (as have Fat Cats) although for different reasons. Otherside for Fat Cats presents an opportunity for an Embassy at the heart of the Swap which can be used to strengthen the Fat Cats brand as metaverse platforms are going to be the Web3 public square (akin to how Twitter is currently the Web2 public square for Crypto & NFTs). \n\nWe have always stated that we would heavily focus on tier one play to earn games instead of Metaverse platforms due to the fact that the global gamer player base is much more well established and therefore likely easier to onboard. That said we noted that social platforms like Minecraft & Robolox have indeed shown that social platforms who also prioritize tons of mini games  ,and not just a do whatever you like approach like Second Life, have done very well. \n\nOtherside is likely the first Metaverse to blur our definitions of Play to earn game and Metaverse because they have heavily gamified the land and have created a resource/mining based economy most akin to Illuvium Zero. in other words in Otherside resources mined from the land will be sold in Agoras (markets) and used to create buildings and the like.  A lot more information has been made available here: https://otherside.xyz/\n\nIn addition to that the creators are Yuga Labs, the creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club who are undeniably the market leader in NFTs who have so far always delivered value to their holders.  In addition to raising north of $300 million to build said Metaverse (which they appear to be doing at an extremely fast pace with the first demo scheduled for the end of July) have the respect of all the strong and active NFT communities; most of which have purchased land for embassies or the like. This is important as mass adoption will be critical and most of these same communities have told me they are terribly unimpressed with the Sandbox & NFT Worlds and so are awaiting a much higher graphic fidelity platform. Otherside is being built on Unreal Engine. \n\nLastly it should be noted that Fat Cats & Crown can work closely together here as Fat Cats has purchased a rare property very close to the central hub, the actual Bored Ape Yacht Club (image attached to the Discord post). Fat Cats location will allow us to create important synergies such as portals to each others land so that we can get our resources to the most important hub, branding benefits and so on.\n\nMany in this DAO have expressed the desire for us to invest in at least one Metaverse platform in order to have a well diversified portfolio and to hedge our bets. I can think of no other Metaverse that comes close to our general investment standards: a proven team, a substantial war chest to keep building, beautiful graphics that can appeal to regular gamers and players of Second Life & Robolox, a high chance of success due to being a market leader and thus able to attract a large player base of NFT natives and a clearly conscious decision to heavily gamify their land not just with mini games like Sandbox but with a full resource based economy akin to Illuvium & Mirandus.

      "content": "After much deliberation and discussion it seems apparent that a Copper ICO makes little to no sense for us. \n\nICO's really fulfill two objects; a capital raise and brand awareness. We feel that we have already raised a substantial amount of funds, assets and liquidity and can continue to do so via the seed round as well as via direct investment from institutions. Copper themselves have stated that P2E ICOs on their platform are not doing well or just waiting. \n\nAs for brand awareness we now have a very valuable tool in the form of Fat Cats & Dylan Shub's status as a WGMI Podcast host and influencer and so we have ways to get our name out there. Once the games open we of course will have even more branding opportunities as all of our players will represent us. We have seen this with large Axie guilds.\n\nWe propose to head directly to applying for a Bancor Liquidity pool. V3 of their pool is scheduled to go live in the next 4-6 weeks and so we will work to get pre approved now. We are already in late discussions with them about this. \n\nBancor offers impermeant loss insurance to project those who put their funds in the pool and to this end require that we give them 400-500k of CROWN to lock up in case of insurance needs. They are open to us being able to give them six month notice of removal within six month (so a year lock up) if we should ever desire to move to another liquidity platform. \n\nWith Bancor you will not ever need to stake anything but CROWN tokens aka they have solved the two sided liquidity pool riddle and this gives us all a massive advantage of being able to still earn fees and CROWN rewards without the risk of impermeant loss.  It will also allow the DAO to use much more of our current liquidity to purchase more gaming assets. The rest of our liquidity aka the USDC can be staked as well to earn fees.\n\nThe Board of governors also ask the DAO to approve the right for us to continue to sell CROWN directly to institutional investors but at no less then the current floor price on the Bancor LP. This will allow us to raise funds like we would have during the ICO but without causing major spikes in the market or undercutting current holders. We have a number of funds interested in what we are doing.\n\nFOR: If you are pro us skipping the ICO and moving to the Bancor Liquidity pool as fast as they can onboard us please vote for.\n\nAGAINST: If you would like us to proceed to the ICO please vote against.\n\nABSTAIN: If you would like us to just wait and see please vote abstain.\n",

      "content": "Fat Cats mint is fast approaching on the 18th of May.\n\nLoki has put forward the motion that Crown Capital should take advantage of the initial offer made by Fat Cats, when it first started, to get 100 whitelist spots and to purchase them for the Crown Capital DAO.\n\nThe argument against is that we spun off Fat Cats because we wanted to keep Crown Capital focused on play to earn games and not have to do lots of research on another asset class aka Blue Chip NFTs aka those building valuable brands akin to Disney and Nike. \n\nThe argument for is that Fat Cats has a competent independent team who will be structured like Crown and doing a lot of heavy research. This thus takes off the competency burden from us. In addition Fat Cats has already negotiated access to 36 Metaverse embassies which Crown members will be granted to. Fat Cats is also willing to integrate CROWN token into their eco-system starting with OpenSea which will give us more exposure and utility. Fat Cats will also manage a gamers guild to help onboard players for us. A formal partnership announcement will come as well. \n\nOverall the investment would get us an important network and affirm our strategic partnership and friendship. If we were to take 100 Fat Cats the Board will be able to mint all of them at cost ie be granted a unique whitelist spot to mint before all others so as to avoid wasted gas wars and avoid us having to get 50 of our holders to mint 2 each. \n\n100 Fat Cats would cost us 8 ETH. Considering our liquid assets are all in USDC we are essentially able to purchase at a large discount (approximately 30%) with the total investment costing us approximately $18580 at current ETH prices.\n\nDylan has made clear that irrespective of whether we decide to purchase these Fat Cats or not, the two DAOs will work closely. In fact Fat Cats is running quite low on whitelist spots and so we do need to decide fairly quickly as Fat Cats has other's waiting for the 100 WL spot allocation.\n\nFOR: If you desire the Crown Capital Board to purchase 100 for us.\n\nAGAINST: If you do not want us to purchase any.\n\nABSTAIN: if you are undecided.",
