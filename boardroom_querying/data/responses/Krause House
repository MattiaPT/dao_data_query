As with prior LOI conversations, having experienced counsel ready to support transaction structuring is valuable to align seller requirements and pathways for community involved ownership.\n\nAs the initial retainer (subsequently amended [here](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x2c3aad30cef9918d8fb4694dce8daea13a6bb9b40a877438b0385027160c2c3b)) has been exhausted, this budget will allow us to continue to engage Hogan Lovells and other counsel as may be required from time to time to support our acquisition efforts.\n\n**Use of Funds**\n\nThese funds will be used exclusively to pay fees as accrued for legal counsel in respect to prospective transactions. Upon receipt of invoices, they will be shared with the LOI Transparency Committee, and corresponding payment requests will be issued to treasury. \n\nNote: in cases where expenses paid result in a successful transaction, said expenses will be refunded to the treasury from transaction fees where possible. \n\nThe relationship with counsel will be managed by Krause House Capital.",

      "content": "**Creation of House Protocol Labs Inc.**\n\nAuthor Name: Commodore\n\n---\n\nFlex & I have been thinking a lot about collective ownership through the lens of remixing access, equity, & governance for the past 3 years. [We made incredible progress](https://x.com/thycommodore/status/1805932981816639997) with owners from the NBA, EPL, & dozens of sports/leagues. The vision resonates with owners, fans, & leagues, the challenge has been the structure in how to do it.\n\nThe Ball Hogs experiment has been a tremendous success. Krause House [acquired](https://big3.com/news/decentralized-autonomous-organization-krause-house-to-purchase-fire-tier-ownership-nft-allotment-for-ball-hogs-big3-team/) effectively 40% of the club at a $1.2m valuation. Since then, the BIG3 [recently announced](https://big3.com/news/gameabove-sports-acquires-fourth-founding-big3-expansion-team/) the 4th sale of a team — with estimated valuations around $10m. We’ve watched the core thesis of a fan (Bayesian) going from an outsider to sitting on-the-bench weekly as an assistant coach, due to a human coordination engine called Krause House DAO. Streaming numbers on X are massive, the league is growing rapidly.\n\nWe’ve seen the progress Lewk has been able to make with Krause House Capital & also the material challenges faced along the way. Insiders in sports ownership continue to be blown away with how much progress we’ve made but matching capital with opportunities continues to be a challenge.\n\nFlex & I have been off-stream for all of 2024 thinking about what comes next for collective fan ownership. We’ve been kicking around an idea to tackle all of these opportunities & problems with one elegant solution:\n\nWe want to build the **reserve currency of sports** & want to call it House Protocol.\n\nLeagues & owners need a simple structure they’re familiar with, the best option is a trust. But instead of creating one-off trusts with traditional ownership requirements, we believe the opportunity is to build treasury-backed protocol to acquire cultural assets including sports clubs. We think of it like the reserve currency for culture, empowering fans with exclusive access and governance.\n\nWe see a future where Krause House DAO is a human coordination layer for sports clubs & House Protocol is a capital coordination layer.\n\n**What is this proposal about?**\n\nWe think both layers are important to make this a reality, but Flex & I need to establish an entity that will require outside funding (that KH cannot afford… nor should it) to build the idea.\n\nAs an example, Krause House could benefit from the creation of House Protocol by acquiring the majority position (>51%) of the Ball Hogs from the BIG3 — without using treasury funds. This would protect KH’s minority position + secure governance of the Ball Hogs. If Krause House were successful at generating interest in the Ball Hogs ownership through the protocol, it could use the fees to both acquire ownership & fund fan engagement experiences we’d like to pursue as a collective.\n\nWe’d love to aspire to build a world where people like Uncle Jon, Bayesian Baller, & many more can come to Krause House and earn incredible fan experiences across a rapidly growing sports portfolio facilitated by the DeFi mechanisms of House Protocol. We see a future where Krause House DAO becomes the home of unique fan experiences around the world.\n\n**What’s this proposal outlining?**\n\n- KH grants the creation of House Protocol Labs Inc. (HPL), a development company to build House Protocol & a financial vehicle to take external funding.\n- KH invokes HPL to build, launch, and maintain House Protocol.\n\n**Covenants**\n\n- House Protocol does not request any funds of any kind from KH.\n- House Protocol will use KH governance as a nomination & approval flow of House Protocol as per protocol parameters, until eventual independent governance.\n- KH acknowledges zero claims of IP for the name & concept of House Protocol.\n- KH can seek to use House Protocol to attempt to acquire the Ball Hogs majority position.",

Production of scouting reports, on-court assistant coaching, and coordination of data-driven strategies with the team.\n    - Lead podcast hosting and assist with the production of all Ball Hogs media and content.\n- Media Production and Editing (Uncle Jon’s Responsibilities):\n    - Production of upcoming Ball Hogs documentaries, shows, and podcasts.\n    - Designing and commissioning of team, community, and fan merchandise.\n    - Operating the online and in-arena merchandise storefronts.\n\n### **How will funds be managed?**\n\n- Funds will be managed through a transparent and accountable process within the Krause House DAO, with regular reporting and auditing to ensure effective use.\n\n### **Team Members Assigned to the Project**\n\n- Uncle Jon: Media Production, Editing, Merchandising, Online Store Management.\n- Bayesian Baller: Coaching, Analytics, Scouting Reports, Podcast Production.\n\n---\n\n### What will Bayesian and Jon ship during Summer 2024?\n\n**1) Ball Hogs Assistant Coaching, Scouting, & Analytics**\n\nIn Year 1, Bayesian supported Rick and the players from afar with his advanced analytics and weekly scouting reports.\n\nIn Year 2, this analysis proved to be so powerful that Rick and the players invited Bayesian sit on the bench, assist with draft strategy, have a say in our team’s roster construction, and travel with the team for all games. \n\nThis was truly an unprecedented amount of access for anyone — let alone one of the team’s NFT owners — and truly made waves towards validating Krause House’s brand and reputation throughout the league.\n\nNow, the Summer 2024 BIG3 campaign is fast approaching and the Ball Hogs will be taking their show on the road once again to some of the biggest cities in the United States!\n\nAnd similar to last summer, Bayesian is looking forward to being an assistant coach and leading all of the data analytics and basketball strategy initiatives for the Ball Hogs (at Rick’s request). \n\nHe will again collaborate directly with Head Coach Rick Barry, Team Captains (Leandro Barbosa, Jodie Meeks, & DaJuan Summers), and the entire team to use advanced stats / video analysis to craft custom scouting reports for the team to use during games and practices.\n\nHere are some of the scouting reports and analytics projects Bayesian has created for the Ball Hogs over the past two summers…\n\n**2023 Season:**\n\n- [Week 4 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Power](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tIHMXABgrB1Fb26RBzdGkmh_JEPp5syO/view?usp=drivesdk)\n- [Week 3 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Ghost Ballers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tfY-O2I0yUHDZt5XvLxp74MRGmIWt9ws/view?usp=drivesdk)\n- [Week 2 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Enemies](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11Af4hZ9h27E2_pNqwW6pL7noZapE-T79/view?usp=drivesdk)\n\n**2022 Season:**\n\n- [Week 4 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Tri-State](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KT7K4z_Ld5_fNN7wiFHdKGj9jRRuCHX4/view?usp=share_link)\n- [Week 3 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Triplets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rqnl7j9ybWFre9cpsK2nxl7uVRa6ohVU/view?usp=share_link)\n- [Week 2 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Ghost Ballers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FrvImaWGpwA7-Vwc22pMfYryWBa3doMq/view?usp=share_link)\n- [Week 1 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Killer 3's](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10r3Fh3zGn6BwM2gn9c4SK7Q_HyxCoPac/view?usp=share_link)\n\nSome of these data-driven scouting reports - which featured unique research around shot quality, lineup analysis, and in-game strategy - were also publicly promoted by the BIG3 on Twitter to their more than 140k followers and others were circulated within the Krause House community as exclusive content for token-holders.\n\n---\n\n**2) Weekly Ball Hogs Show & Media Content w/ Rick Barry & Joy DeAngela**\n\n*Featuring Special Guests such as NBA Hall of Famers, Players, and Coaches from around the BIG3*\n\nWe have partnered with Ball Hogs HC Rick Barry and received approval from the BIG3’s Executive Team to produce a weekly show on behalf of Krause House in which we will interview some of the biggest names from around the BIG3 this summer.\n\nThe show will be co-hosted by Bayesian Baller and Rick Barry, with additional support from social media and marketing correspondent Joy De’Angela, and lead audio/video production from Uncle Jon.\n\nBy partnering with NBA Hall of Famer Rick Barry, he has agreed to and we plan on leveraging his legendary reputation to secure exclusive sit-down interview with high-profile guests from other teams in the BIG3.\n\nOur list of desired and potential guests includes…\n\nBIG3 Coaches:\n\n- Julius Erving\n- George Gervin\n- Charles Oakley\n- Nancy Lieberman\n- Lisa Leslie\n- Gary Payton\n- Rick Mahorn\n- Reggie Theus\n- Michael Cooper\n- & Stephen Jackson\n\nBIG3 Players:\n\n- Rashard Lewis\n- Michael Beasley\n- Leandro Barbosa\n- Corey Brewer\n- Nick Young\n- Jonathon Simmons\n- Franklin Session\n- Cuttino Mobley\n- Jason Richardson\n- Earl Clark\n- & Joe Johnson\n\nWith Rick’s caché and the league’s support (they’ve confirmed to Rick that they will work with us in any way possible to be of assistance), we believe that the above list of coaches and players is not only realistic but could drive major headlines around the basketball world throughout the NBA’s offseason. And of course, all content will have Krause House’s name and branding front and center to further validate our brand as a multidimensional force in the industry!\n\n---\n\n**3) Develop Merchandise for Our Team, Community, & Fans**\n\nOver the past two summers Uncle Jon has designed, produced, and sold Ball Hogs team merchandise to fans both online and in the arena on gameday. Last season the shirts, in particular, were not only worn by the fans and Krause House faithful, but were also donned by the Ball Hogs players themselves which generated a ton of organic buzz around the team within league and player circles. Which got us thinking…\n\nThis summer, not only do we want to produce more exclusive merchandise for our fans and community, but we would also like to outfit our team with the most unique Krause House x Ball Hogs branded performance apparel the BIG3 has ever seen! Our ideas for this include practice gear, gameday warmups, and exclusive team collectives.\n\nIt’s more than look good, play good. We want to develop a brand that becomes an iconic staple of the BIG3 and makes players proud to rep the Ball Hogs. We envision that this strategy could be a huge marketing boost for Krause House and the Ball Hogs, as well as, could be scaled and perfected for future clients.\n\n---\n\n**4) Deepen Financial Relationship w/ BIG3 & Other Team Owners**\n\nWe would like to leverage our involvement with the Ball Hogs this summer to be a launch pad for additional revenue — either via our ownership or from providing our services to other teams.\n\nOur work with the Ball Hogs over the past two seasons has proven to be of tremendous value, and this time around we would really like explore getting something back for providing this value.\n\nWe believe that we can start thinking about ramping up our offerings, putting together a deck of our services, and (for starters) beginning to offer them to other team/owners around the BIG3.\n\n---\n\n**### bUt SomEb0dY m1gHt t@kE t0o mUçh**\n\nBoth the community and the Stewardship team has the power to cancel this stream if it is being abused.  In addition, if a contributor abuses this trust, they are effectively burning their social credibility and ability to successfully submit proposals in the future.  We expect some lossiness; however, we believe the benefits of getting good work off the ground is worth this small cost.",

      "content": "**Ball Hogs 2024 Budget**\n\nAuthor Name: Uncle Jon & Bayesian Baller\n\nhttps://www.notion.so/krausehousework/Ball-Hogs-2024-Budget-9308923ca4334083935d17974749a1f3?pvs=4\n\n### TL;DR — Project Value Add\n\nThe 2024 BIG3 Season kicks off on June 15th, and the Ball Hogs will be looking to build on last summer’s record-breaking progress!\n\nSince purchasing the team in 2022, Krause House’s operation of the Ball Hogs has proven to be our community’s most significant proof-of-concept towards team ownership and future acquisitions.\n\nIn Year 1, the primary focus of our operation was on building community. Led by Uncle Jon, we proved that a DAO is capable of cultivating the most passionate fan base the BIG3 has ever seen by way of the Pig Pen, decentralized media, and merchandising collaboration.\n\nIn Year 2, the primary focus of our operation was improving on-court performance. Led by Bayesian Baller, we proved that a DAO is capable of taking the league’s last place team and turning them into an overnight contender by way of data-driven roster construction, game prep, and assistant coaching.\n\nNow in Year 3, Uncle Jon and Bayesian Baller aim to combine their efforts in what is expected to be our team’s most critical and the league’s most highly anticipated season to date.\n\nWith the BIG3 exploring new revenue models and team sales, given our strong relationship with league executives and blossoming team performance we could have a unique opportunity to re-sell the Ball Hogs for a profit after this season. Such a move would not only demonstrate our ability to turnaround a franchise’s prospects in a short period of time, but do so while simultaneously earning a return on our initial investment. This would be an enormous stamp of validation for the DAO.\n\nTo maximize on this summer’s forthcoming opportunity and drive the value of the Ball Hogs higher than ever before, we would like to put forth the following proposal for your consideration.\n\nSigned,\n\nUncle Jon x Bayesian Baller\n\n**Click here to see what’s possible and get hyped for another big summer of Ball Hogs basketball!**\n\nhttps://streamable.com/u58556\n\n---\n\n### **Requested Budget:**\n\n- Up to $69k USDC\n\nFor comparison:\n\n- [2023 Ball Hogs Budget Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0xf2f9b2cb78be4bd4e5e1b00fde26c2eaf4f5ae467688c8ca11b935e3e3b21938)\n- [2022 Ball Hogs Budget Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x6abeb497746dc1f198845ef21a2c9637090f2282b48abfe21272e6b9365894fb)\n\n### **How Will Funds Be Used?**\n\n**1) Travel, Lodging, & Transportation to Ball Hogs Games for Team Contributors**\n\nThe 2024 BIG3 season kicks off on June 15th and will travel through 10 U.S. Cities over the course of the summer including Oakland, Tampa, Baltimore, Newark, Anaheim, Portland, Cincinnati, San Antonio, Nashville, and Boston (in addition to the BIG3 Combine & Draft in Las Vegas on May 24th). We are requesting funds for modest travel, lodging, and transportation accommodations in every city. [Click here to view the entire summer schedule.](https://big3.com/news/big3-coming-in-hot-for-season-7-tipping-off-june-15/)\n\n- **Hotels:** Up to $12k\n- **Flights:** Up to $12k\n- **Transportation:** Up to $6k\n\n*See the notion link for this propsal (https://www.notion.so/krausehousework/Ball-Hogs-2024-Budget-9308923ca4334083935d17974749a1f3?pvs=4) for an itemized breakdown of potential travel cost estimations.*\n\n**2) Recording, Production, & Publishing of Weekly Ball Hogs Media & Content**\n\nWe have partnered with Ball Hogs HC Rick Barry and received approval from the BIG3’s Executive Team to produce a weekly show on behalf of Krause House in which we will interview some of the biggest names from around the BIG3 this summer. We are requesting funds for the necessary equipment to record, produce, and publish this content in a professional manner, as well as, to procure the talent needed to complete and appropriately market this project. Jon has already arranged for the BIG3 to cover transportation of the equipment to/from the various cities each week.\n\n- **Professional Media & Content Equipment:** Up to $11k\n- **Production & Viral Marketing (Joy DeAngela):** Up to $15k\n- **Co-Hosting & Guest Acquisition (Rick Barry):** Up to $4.5k\n- **Miscellaneous (i.e. Venues, Emergencies):** Up to $1k\n\n*See the notion proposal link (https://www.notion.so/krausehousework/Ball-Hogs-2024-Budget-9308923ca4334083935d17974749a1f3?pvs=4) for an itemized breakdown of potential media and content estimations for the Ball Hogs media and content.*\n\n**3) Merchandising Development for Our Team, Community, & Fans**\n\nOver the past two summers Uncle Jon has designed, produced, and sold Ball Hogs team merchandise that generated a ton of organic buzz around our team and community. This summer, not only do we want to produce more exclusive merch for our fans and community, but we would also like to outfit our team with the most unique Krause House x Ball Hogs branded performance apparel the BIG3 has ever seen! The strategy is more than “look good, play good”. We want to develop a brand that becomes an iconic staple of the BIG3 and makes players proud to rep the Ball Hogs. We envision that this strategy could be a huge marketing boost for Krause House and the Ball Hogs, as well as, could be scaled and perfected for future clients. We are requesting the following funds to cover the design, development, and production of this Krause House x Ball Hogs merchandise.\n\n- **Merch:** Up to $7.5k\n\n*See the notion proposal link (https://www.notion.so/krausehousework/Ball-Hogs-2024-Budget-9308923ca4334083935d17974749a1f3?pvs=4) for a breakdown of potential merchandising costs for the team, our community, and our fans.*\n\n---\n\n# Appendix:\n\nNotion Proposal Link: https://www.notion.so/krausehousework/Ball-Hogs-2024-Budget-9308923ca4334083935d17974749a1f3?pvs=4\n\n\n## C) Joy DeAngela Travel Notes\n\nAfter discussions with Joy and her manager, we have agreed that on weeks in which Uncle Jon will be out on “new dad duty” Krause House will cover her flight and hotel. On weeks that Jon is with the team, Joy will be covering her own travel costs (with the exception of the draft in Vegas.)\n\n## D) Professional Media Equipment: Cost Estimates Table\n\nEquipment will be used weekly to capture and record the Ball Hogs Show with Coach Rick Barry and to film sideline content to be used across social media and other marketing collateral.\n\nAll equipment will be owned by Krause House. Following the completion of the season, the equipment can be sold and the funds returned to the treasury. Or they may be kept under the community’s discretion for future media initiatives.\n\n## E) Fan & Team Merchandising Notes\n\n- **High Quality Player Merch**\n    - Some of the biggest feedback we got within the league were the cool shirts our players wore. Particularly the caricature shirt featuring each of the guys on our team. This year we want to up the ante by providing exclusive warm ups for our players. The league is notorious amongst the players for the lack of s.w.a.g given so why not step in? We’re looking to design warm-up tops and bottoms featuring not only the Hogs branding, but also Krause House branding prominently.\n- **Community-Driven Fan Merchandise**\n    - Uncle Jon will initially head up merch creation in hopes that other members of the community will kick in and help with designs. Designs will be created and put up on the Shopify platform and sold as print-to-order to avoid excessive production costs.\n- **Store Operation and Maintenance**\n    - The fan merch store will be powered by Shopify for fulfillment and Printful as the print to order service. The membership fee’s of these services come out to about $200/mo. The plan is to have the store be actively listed from May-September with a re-assesment after the season is over. If our merch is successful, we will keep the store open longer. All profit from sales will go back to the KH treasury.\n\n## F) Add’l Revenue Models & Ownership Exploration\n\nWe would like to leverage our involvement with the Ball Hogs this summer to be a launch pad for additional revenue — either via our ownership or from providing our services to other teams.\n\nOur work with the Ball Hogs over the past two seasons has proven to be of tremendous value, and this time around we would really like explore getting something back for providing this value.\n\nWe believe that we can start thinking about ramping up our offerings, putting together a deck of our services, and (for starters) beginning to offer them to other team/owners around the BIG3.\n\n---\n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\nWe will be using the Ball Hogs multi-sig set up last year. The wallet will have a treasury funded by this proposal, and expenses will be reimbursed with 3/5 signatures. \n\nSigners:\n\n- Uncle Jon\n- Bayesian Baller\n- Commodore\n- Shanny\n- Lewwwk\n\n### Team Members Assigned to the Project\n\n- Uncle Jon\n- Bayesian Baller",

      "content": "**Bayesian Baller Contributor Stream Renewal**\n\n**Author:** Bayesian Baller\n\n**Wallet:** 0xD9b3Ad0eb0d3b9DF83CE919198F9ad0Ff692522F\n\n**TL;DR - Contributor Value-Add**\n\nA core contributor since Day 1, Bayesian is back and eager as ever to serve the Krause House community in 2024!\n\nAfter a busy summer repping KH in the BIG3, coaching alongside NBA legend Rick Barry, and helping the Ball Hogs to their most successful season ever, I took the Fall off from my regularly scheduled contributor streams to reset, recharge, and refocus on how to continue my contributions to Krause House in the most meaningful ways possible.\n\nOver the past several months, I’ve spent a considerable amount of time observing, reflecting, and thinking deeply about the highest impact opportunities, and determined that I would like focus on three primary goals moving forward: (1) re-energizing our community, (2) building new partnerships, and (3) getting back to the creative principles upon which Krause House was established.\n\nIn the past, I’ve contributed on a variety of fronts -- including everything from media and podcasting, to coaching and analytics, as well as, product and strategy. These are core my strengths, and I would love to continue using them to inch us closer to our collective mission in 2024 and beyond!\n\n**Funding Request**\n\nUp to:\n\n- 4k $KRAUSE / month\n- 4k $USDC / month\n\nPaid monthly for 4 months (January - April 2024).\n\nStewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.\n\nCommunity may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.\n\n**What will Bayesian Baller focus on during this contributor stream?**\n\n**1) Re-Energizing The Community w/ Exclusive Original Content**\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n- Season 3 of the Around The Association Podcast\n- Exclusive Original Content Promoting Krause Picks\n\nSince January 2022, I’ve been the Host & Executive Producer of **[Around The Association](https://open.spotify.com/show/3YadlLpwrMTOG0ecvX65bw)**, the official basketball podcast of Krause House DAO & the first podcast launched by a non-steward under the community's media network.\n\nFrom Day 1 my intent with Around The Association has been to drive community engagement, demonstrate Krause House's basketball acumen, as well as, break down the barrier to entry into Web3 and get everyday hoops fans interested in DAOs.\n\nIn addition to launching Season 3 of Around The Association, my vision for the next several months centers around creating exclusive, original content that promotes other KH products in which the community has invested. The specific product that I would like to support is Krause Picks.\n\nIn speaking with Greg, the user base has remained very loyal, highly engaged, and optimistically consistent since its inception, as we continue to award daily prizes despite minimal day-to-day promotion. I think a great community-built and branded product like this deserves its own exclusive, dedicated content that gets pushed out and published across Krause House socials.\n\nThe idea would be to produce weekly content -- primarily in the form short-form videos -- that previews and recaps the week’s slate of games, analyzes top performances and league-wide trends, as well as, shouts out the winners and gives recommendations on how to pick certain games. Think about how media companies like ESPN and FanDuel use original shows (like Daily Wager) and personalities (like Shams Charania) to promote their sports betting products. By tying content to an existing product in which the DAO has already invested major time and resources, I believe we can maximize its potential and see some major dividends.\n\n**2) Spearheading New Partnerships w/ Prospective Teams & Leagues**\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n- Generate Leads & Investment Opportunities for KH Capital\n- Spearhead Collaboration w/ Prospective Euro Basketball Club\n\nSince Day 1 of joining Krause House, I’ve opened up my personal and professional networks to connect our community with a variety of opportunities and prospective partnerships in the sports industry. In the DAO’s early days, this included partnering with the Big Ten Conference to crowdsource basketball content in exchange for KH bounties. More recently, this has included orchestrating connections for Krause House Capital with opportunities in the collegiate sports and international basketball markets. The latter, of which, has particularly heated up lately and in my opinion presents the greatest immediate opportunity to our community.\n\nMore specifically, over the past several months I’ve been working closely with a group of investors and former athletes who are actively engaged in the acquisition of a top-tier French basketball club. If the acquisition is successful, it would open up a floodgate of opportunities for Krause House to participate in a Ball Hogs 2.0 style collaboration with the franchise -- ranging everywhere from community building and court refurbishments throughout Europe to basketball operations and front office type contributions to the immediate team.\n\n**3) Restoring The Community’s Creative Juices w/ Product Design & Merchandising**\n\n********TLDR:********\n\n- Organize Exclusive Merchandise Campaigns\n- Design & Develop Premium KH Collectibles\n\nWith a focus on engaging our community and getting back to the creative principles upon which Krause House was built, I would like to lead a merchandising initiative that not only sees reruns of past KH staples, but also features exclusive drops of premium collectibles. Product ideas include letterman jackets, caricature tees, vintage snapbacks, and performance gear among others. The strategy would revolve around pre-orders to maximize margins and ensure profitability, and rest assured that any initiative would certainly need its own additional proposal in order to proceed (similar to the recently approved proposal to order more of the famous KH basketball shorts).\n\nI think Krause House-branded merch presents enormous opportunities. Having been on the ground in all of the BIG3 cities and having seen how the Ball Hogs players and fans obsessed over the merch that Uncle Jon and the team created was one of the coolest experiences ever. Players from other teams would literally come up to us at the hotels and in the arenas telling us that the Ball Hogs and Krause House had BY FAR the best merch of any team in the BIG3, and that they wanted us to create their team’s merch, as well. There is serious opportunity here that, if properly explored, could potentially expand beyond making merch just for our immediate community. Think “In The Lab” style opportunities.\n\n**Bayesian Baller’s Background & Professional Qualifications**\n\nBayesian has been a core contributor to Krause House since Day 1. Over the past 2+ years, he’s contributed to the community on a variety of fronts -- notably in media, podcasting, and coaching analytics roles.\n\nBayesian leads all of Krause House’s basketball analytics and data science initiatives, which have included deep collaborations with the Ball Hogs, BIG3, and Overtime Elite. Most notably, over the past two summers Bayesian has become Rick Barry’s right hand man while spearheading all of the scouting, analytics, and assistant coaching responsibilities for the Ball Hogs. He’s also the Host & Executive Producer of Around The Association, Krause House’s go-to podcast for all things basketball, which now has a show catalog fast approaching 35 episodes.\n\nOutside of KH, Bayesian has worked professionally in the sports industry for 5+ years, and currently serves as the Director of Product for a leader in the college sports and basketball analytics space. Prior to that, he spent several years at the collegiate level with two major Div. 1 college basketball programs. And along the way, he has developed working relationships with a variety of influential figures in the basketball industry, who he will continue to lean upon to help facilitate partnerships and opportunities for Krause House to reach their ultimate goal of NBA ownership.",

The purpose of this stream is to help bring our mission home by securing the terms and capital for ownership in the top 5 leagues and beyond.\n\n**Current Status**\n\nWe are currently raising capital to secure ownership positions in the EFL and a top-5 league, while doing diligence and pursuing a portfolio of opportunities in North America and Europe. A primary capital partner has expressed interest in investing mid 8-figures with us. We are working to firm up that commitment, finalise structure, and make our first investment.\n\n**Results from Previous Work**\n\nLewwwk, in collaboration with Commodore, Flex, Matt Lynch, and advisors:\n\n- Developed and led a mid nine-figure multi-year bid for an interest in a Top-5 league team (in process)\n- Developed JV strategy for major acquisitions, serving to drive potential future KH collaborations\n- Led conversations and confirmed pathways with the NBA for Krause House ownership in the NBA\n- Represented Krause House at Thinking Football conference in Porto, deepening football presence\n- Continued building relationships with multiple large scale media, institutional, and family office investors\n- Drafted protocol infrastructures to enable onchain loyalty and ownership\n- Explored potential partnerships with various technical and L2 rollup service providers\n- Updated KH Capital strategy to include potential investment in KH TD, protocols, and assets\n- Handled ongoing Krause House Capital administration\n- Supported Treasury Diversification strategy and efforts\n\n**What Changed Over the Last Stream**\n\nWe have now credibly demonstrated access to exclusive, top-tier, off-market opportunities. While transactions in sports have unpredictable outcomes and pacing, we have also demonstrated the capacity to build a robust portfolio of opportunities based on solid analysis and our unique approach to building enterprise value through digital innovation and fan engagement.\n\nWhile the macro environment is still challenging, there is a notable shift out of the depths of bearishness. This is evident in both the macro and the crypto markets. The end of the SBF trial; deeper adoption of crypto in institutional finance; advances in web3 tooling and infrastructure; and a thawing of the VC and retail markets are all welcome news after a challenging 18 months.\n\n**What Does Success Look Like**\n\n- Capitalization of Krause House Capital\n- First investment complete\n- Krause House capitalization\n\n**Voting Options and Determination**\n\nApprove\n\nAgainst\n\nAbstain\n\nAbstain votes are discarded.

      "title": "Krause Picks Future Development",
      "content": "Krause Picks launched just under 2 weeks ago and has thus far seen massive traffic and engagement across other communities. This proposal allows the DAO to continue building on Krause Picks’ early success with further development.\n\n**************Budget:************** See “Options” for a list of the potential costs for Krause House.\n\n****************Duration****************: This project will last 6 months unless otherwise paused or canceled based on the scenarios provided below.\n\n******This proposal is for future development of the platform and in no way represents retroactive compensation for any work done up to this point.*\n\n## Background\n\nIn under 2 weeks, Krause Picks has seen **1,200 site visitors**, **200 signups**, **over 5,000 picks made,** and **an average of 75 DAUs**. This was done with minimal marketing, user retargeting, or automated outreach (all features that could be implemented with this proposal). The majority of these users are not crypto natives and represent an audience of basketball fans that Krause House has long struggled to reach.\n\nThe app's current state was built by Greg (@gregfromstl) as a side project to build on past experiments with Pick ‘Em games within Krause House. The project has now reached a point where it can continue to exist as a small win for the DAO or act as a catalyst for stronger engagement, partnerships, and example-setting for Krause House’s potential.\n\n## Options\n\n**Option A: The project remains in its current state. - $0 / month**\n\nThe project will see no further features or improvement and will remain as it stands today for the rest of the season. Greg will continue to distribute daily prizes to those who participate.\n\n**Option B: The project continues to develop at a rate of 25 hours per week - Basic Plan - $6,600 / month**\n\nGreg and his team at Be Water Labs will further develop, maintain, and steward the project. New features and partnerships (listed below) will be aggressively pursued to further Krause House’s reputation, engagement, and inroads within the basketball community.\n\n**Option C: The project continues to develop at a rate of 40 hours per week - Premium Plan - $9,000 / month**\n\nGreg and his team at Be Water Labs will further develop, maintain, and steward the project with a significant level of commitment. New features and partnerships (listed below) will be aggressively pursued to further Krause House’s reputation, engagement, and inroads within the basketball community.\n\n***********************These options represent a ~33% reduction of Be Water’s typical rates.***********************\n\n### What do the time commitments amount to?\n\nWhat does ************************************25 hours/week************************************ or ******************************40 hours/week****************************** look like? For context, the current state of the app was developed in approximately 40 hours of work. The amount of deliverables varies depending on complexity, but both these options will allow for significant progress to be made in a short period.\n\n## Planned Features\n\nWe’ve been exploring several requested and anticipated features, including but not limited to:\n\n- Social picking\n    - Follow others’ picks\n    - Pick comments\n    - Pick reactions\n- Open-ended prediction markets\n    - Anyone can create a pick “question”\n    - Predict longer-term events\n    - Earn and stake “points” to determine leaderboards\n- Betting analytics\n    - In-depth analytics on personal and community performance\n    - Recommendations for picks to make (both on Krause Picks and betting platforms)\n    - Player-based picks\n- Crypto Integrations\n    - Embedded wallets for all players (abstracted away for non-crypto users)\n    - NFT-based rewards\n    - On-chain performance badges\n- Live-streaming integrations\n    - Sign in to and connect with Playback\n    - Make picks during B2B streams\n- Sponsored prize pools\n    - Allow anyone to sponsor a prize pool and determine winning criteria\n- Discord integration\n    - DM players their daily performance\n    - Publicly recognize winners\n- Automated reward distribution\n\n## Planned Partnerships\n\nWe’ve also been in discussions with some notable groups interested in partnering on the project.\n\n- Playground & the NBA\n    - Playground has partnered with the NBA and several individual players to create performance-based NFTs. NFTs evolve traits based on player, team, or other stats. We’ve held multiple discussions with Playground on how we can put Krause Picks rewards on-chain.\n    - Playground also manages the NBA’s Discord. We’ve discussed building a Discord integration to use in the NBA’s server.\n- Dapper Labs (Creators of TopShot)\n    - Our largest community partner, B2B, has discussed the project with Dapper Labs, who have demonstrated interest in partnering with us. We’re currently working on a pitch to closely partner with Dapper and TopShot.\n- Playback\n    - Playback is a sports streaming platform and home to many NBA-focused communities. Our community partner B2B has a large audience on Playback and close ties with their team. We’re currently in the planning phase of potential Playback integrations.\n\n## Direction\n\nThe following will serve as the general guide posts and direction for the project, while allowing opportunity for open-ended exploration of what works based on user feedback. The main objectives of the project are:\n\n- To explore fantasy-like experiences and how they can be augmented with web3, while remaining accessible to every day audiences\n- To leverage these experiences for fan loyalty and engagement from a team perspective, and how they can improve a team’s bottom line\n\n## Cancellation\n\nIf the project fails to gain further traction or needs to be discontinued or modified for any reason, this proposal can be canceled at any time by a majority vote of the Stewards.\n\n## How will Funds be Used?\n\nKrause House will be invoiced by Be Water Labs before the beginning of each month. This invoice will be due within 2 weeks of issuance. If the invoice is not paid by the deadline, a late fee of 10% per week will be applied to the invoice.\n\n## Ownership\n\nAll produced assets and work will be fully owned by Krause House. This includes everything thus far (effective on receipt of the first payment). Be Water reserves the right to use all work developed in marketing materials.\n\n## Be Water Operating Practices\n\nThe following is an overview of how Be Water operates for all projects, including Krause Picks, should this proposal pass.\n\n### Who will work on the project?\n\nThe project will be designated a minimum of one developer, one designer, and a project lead. The project lead will be Greg for this project. Bandwidth is managed closely and projects are limited for each team member, so everyone has time and capacity to give the project the attention it needs.\n\n### Updates\n\nThe project team meets internally daily for premium plan projects, and twice per week for basic plan projects.\n\nThe project team meets weekly (premium) or bi-weekly (basic) to plan the upcoming sprint and designate upcoming tasks. Any Krause House member is welcome to sit in on these meetings.\n\nBefore each sprint planning session, a representative from Krause House will meet with the project lead to discuss updates and direction.\n\nEvery Friday (or every other if basic plan), Be Water will share a “changelog”, detailing all shipped improvements to the project.\n\n## How votes will be counted\n\nIf Option A has greater than 50% of votes, Option A will pass.\n\nOtherwise, the greater of Option B and C will pass.\n\nThis takes into account that a vote for Option C (Premium Plan), is also a vote for Option B.",

      "content": "Permit the usage of Krause House IP in Striker3\n\nAuthor Name: Mario\n\n### Permission Requested:\n\nGrant Striker Manager 3 the ability to leverage Krause House’s IP and design assets in-game starting October 1st 2023 a 3 year contract with the possibility of breaking the agreement on a yearly basis. \n\n### Requested Budget:\n\nNone\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\n[Striker Manager 3](https://strikermanager.com/) (SM3), a next gen football manager game leveraging web3 technology has proposed to Krause House (KH) to partner.\n\n**Business Model:** Implement a revenue-sharing model that is fair and equitable for both parties. This will include the following clauses for a 3 year period:\n\n- **User Commission**: Striker Manager 3 agrees to pay Krause House 10% of the net profits generated by all users coming from Krause House. This will include revenues generated from in-game purchases and other related products. With net profits, Striker Manager 3 will pay after discounting the commissions and taxes that might apply.\n    - Every user registered to Striker Manager 3 have his own promotor link. If this user invites new users, he will be linked to them indefinitely and he will receive 10% of the Ucoins (Internal SM3 token) their users buy forever. So if I invite a friend and this one buy 100 Ucoins, I will receive 10 Ucoins.\n    - This will encourage Krause House football fans to spread the word.\n- **Commission on Premium Assets:** Striker Manager 3 agrees to pay Krause House 50% of the net profits generated from the sale of Krause House's premium assets within the game, such as players, cosmetic items, etc. With net profits, Striker Manager 3 will pay after discounting the commissions and taxes that might apply.\n- **Exclusive Discount:** Striker Manager 3 will offer users coming from Krause House a 10% discount on the purchase of plots of land within SM3 as an additional incentive for Krause House members.\n\nClarity on what the Krause House brand gets applied to in-game\n\n- In terms of visibility, the KH brand will be applied to cosmetics (gloves, hats, boots, jerseys...), Striker Manager 3 will also provide KH a plot of land wherever the KH appointee wants (we will put a KH badge on) and KH will have the official team within SM3 with a distinction in it (Similar as Twitter Blue mark).\n- SM3 can also put on sales of KH NFT in-game players. (SM3 will need KH’s approval before adding any of KH’s visual contents into the game - oversight by delegate Mario and Stewards).\n- Also, SM3 will mention KH on their Social Networks as part of the co-marketing.\n- All of this is in the beginning, if the KH community or SM3 have more ideas we can explore it all on an emergent basis.\n- If we terminate the contract, SM3 can easily remove all KH branding within the game. The unique thing SM3 won't be able to remove are the KH NFTs players sold. But this will generate revenue to KH if the assets are being sold in the secondary market even though the contract may be finished.\n\n“But Krause House is a basketball community”\n\n- As Krause House’s playbook is transferrable across many sports, working with reputable partners across other sports will only strengthen our value proposition as a global sports community for ownership groups in the NBA and other top revenue generating leagues\n\nIn my opinion, this is low risk as this partnership outlines a win-win agreement. \n\n### ***Full Scope of Partnership between KH & Striker Manager 3 can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mOxYryMaBQJgSrQfof4HF5XAYPsQLuDPtV_kAUSVfL0/edit)***\n\n# Termination Clause\n\nIn terms of termination, we will add two contacts and email addresses from both sides, **Jaume Noguera (Marketing and Licensing Manager of UPLAY Online)** and KH delegate, Mario.\n\nEvery email sent to these addresses will be valid as a formal notification. We can also agree that we have to notify, if we want to terminate early the contract, two months before we reach a date we agree upon. We can agree a date for every year and if we want to terminate the contract we have to provide the notifications two months before.\n\n### Permission\n\nKH delegate can be appointed by Stewards at any time, and Mario is appointed as the delegate. \n\n## About Striker Manager 3\n\n**Parent Company:** Striker Manager 3 is created by [UPLAY Online](https://www.uplayonline.com/) which is an independent video game studio based in the city of Barcelona, Spain. \n\nStriker Manager 3 is a Play to Earn multiplayer football manager game that combines the fun of traditional football games with the ability to be the owner of your in-game assets.\n\nUsers can generate income while trading and evolving their NFT game assets, taking possession of their plots of land in the Striker Manager 3 world and becoming the real owner of their club.\n\n[Striker Manager 3](https://strikermanager.com/) was launched in May 2023. Since the launch, more than 10K users have registered into the game and we also have arround 1.100 and 1.300 DAU and 3.500 MAU. They are planning an extensive marketing campaign to drive further growth\n\n“*We've partnered with renowned esports clubs, including DUX Gaming (Spain), Team Gullit (Netherlands), Timbers Esports (Mexico) and Qlash (Italy).”*\n\n“*We also offer \"International Basketball Manager 2023\" for sale on Steam, expanding our sports gaming portfolio.”*\n\n### Additional Collaboration with Striker Manager 3 and their sister brand, International Basketball Manager:\n\n**Additional Collaboration**: In addition to financial collaboration, both parties can explore opportunities to jointly promote events and activities, such as the NBA Pick EM in collaboration with the premium basketball game community ([International Basketball Manager 23](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2098130/International_Basketball_Manager_23/)) or the Soccer Weekly Pick EM with the Striker3 and Krause House Discords.\n\n**Community Tools:**\n\nThe possibility of using Discord tools ([Mocha](https://top.gg/bot/987974524140146728)), such as a channel bridging bot, can be explored to amplify communities and encourage interaction between Striker Manager 3 and Krause House members.\n\nIt’s important to note that UPLAY Online is also developing a basketball manager web3 game. It will be similar to Striker Manager 3 but adapted to the basketball particularities. They are already working on this game and hope to launch it by the end of this year or at the beginning of the next. Krause House will be positioned to partner with this product as well.",

They will send a lump sum total of to the KH Treasury at the end of each month. ex. Nov 30, $300 USDC will be sent to KH Treasury.\n\n### Bonus Budget based on KPI:\n\nKPI: We propose as $1700 as the base budget and then move up five dollars for every additional 100 members the Pick Em attracts around the world. \n\nPayment made upon the additional members milestone being complete.\n\nFor example:\n\nMonth 1 (starting Nov): 100 users —> KH still pays $10/day\nMonth 2 (Dec): 200 users —> KH pays $15/day\nMonth 3 (Jan): 400 users —> KH pays $25\netc.\n\n### How will funds be used? Who/what will it go to?\n\nWallet: bewaterlabs.eth\n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\nBy Greg who will be providing non-cash rewards like [NBA.com](http://NBA.com) gift cards.\n\n### Team Members Assigned to the Project\n\n- Mario, Greg, Dream from B2B & Top Shot\n\n### Project Details\n\nKrause House, B2B and In The Lab will collaborate on a 2023-2024 NBA Pick Em\n\nAfter the success of the FIBA Pick Em which saw 150+ users around the world and nearly 4000 picks made, we would like to increase the stakes for users by providing $10 daily winnings to the top Pick Em Player of the Day! \n\n### Why $10 per day cash equivalent prizes?\n\nWe noticed most Pick Ems do pay outs at the end of the season and as a result, users lose engagement. However, if we provide prizes daily, we can build increased daily engagement throughout the 173 days of the NBA season!\n\n# Top Shot Packs + Game Streams\n\nIn addition to the $10 per day, we are in discussions with our NBA fan communities to have prizes such as NBA Top Shot moments, NBA tickets and merch for users. These prizes will be announced as the season progresses.\n\n### Top Shot Moments & Packs as prizes\n\nB2B has already committed to provided $10/day to add to the pool and also will provide Top Shot Packs & Moments to top performers on the weekly leaderboards.\n\n### Game Streams 3-5/week!\n\nAnother cool aspect is Dream, leader of B2B, will be hosting 3-5 Playback stream nights as an official partner. He’ll be streaming NBA League Pass games and providing rewards for viewers who tune in. \n\nThe KH community is more than welcome to join the streams to win some more prizes, enjoy the fun and see how their picks are doing.\n\n## More on the way…\n\nIn the future, we are looking to collaborate with the premium basketball game community ([International Basketball Manager 23](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2098130/International_Basketball_Manager_23/)) & the Soccer Weekly Pick EM via the UPlay Managed Discords.\n\nWe are also in early discussions with Overtime’s Discord to participate in the Daily Pick Em.\n\n### Clause\n\nIf any for any reason this projects progress isn’t going well, Mario, Greg, Stewards & anyone in the community can make a proposal to shut down the project and return any outstanding funds.",

      "content": "Author Name: Mario\n\n### Permission Requested:\n\nGrant Striker Manager 3 the ability to leverage Krause House’s IP and design assets in-game starting October 1st 2023 a 3 year contract with the possibility of breaking the agreement on a yearly basis. \n\n### Requested Budget:\n\nNone\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\n[Striker Manager 3](https://strikermanager.com/), a next gen football manager game leveraging web3 technology has proposed to Krause House to partner.\n\n**Business Model:** Implement a revenue-sharing model that is fair and equitable for both parties. This will include the following clauses for a 3 year period:\n\n- **User Commission**: Striker Manager 3 agrees to pay Krause House 10% of the net profits generated by all users coming from Krause House. This will include revenues generated from in-game purchases and other related products.\n    - Every user registered to Striker Manager 3 have his own promotor link. If this user invites new users, he will be linked to them indefinitely and he will receive 10% of the Ucoins (Internal SM3 token) their users buy forever. So if I invite a friend and this one buy 100 Ucoins, I will receive 10 Ucoins.\n    - This will encourage Krause House football fans to spread the word.\n- **Commission on Premium Assets:** Striker Manager 3 agrees to pay Krause House 50% of the net profits generated from the sale of Krause House's premium assets within the game, such as players, cosmetic items, etc.\n- **Exclusive Discount:** Striker Manager 3 will offer users coming from Krause House a 10% discount on the purchase of plots of land within SM3 as an additional incentive for Krause House members.\n\n“But Krause House is a basketball community”\n\n- As Krause House’s playbook is transferrable across many sports, working with reputable partners across other sports will only strengthen our value proposition as a global sports community for ownership groups in the NBA and other top revenue generating leagues\n\nIn my opinion, this is low risk as this partnership outlines a win-win agreement. \n\n### ***Full Scope of Partnership between KH & Striker Manager 3 can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mOxYryMaBQJgSrQfof4HF5XAYPsQLuDPtV_kAUSVfL0/edit)***\n\n## About Striker Manager 3\n\n**Parent Company:** Striker Manager 3 is created by [UPLAY Online](https://www.uplayonline.com/) which is an independent video game studio based in the city of Barcelona, Spain. \n\nStriker Manager 3 is a Play to Earn multiplayer football manager game that combines the fun of traditional football games with the ability to be the owner of your in-game assets.\n\nUsers can generate income while trading and evolving their NFT game assets, taking possession of their plots of land in the Striker Manager 3 world and becoming the real owner of their club.\n\n[Striker Manager 3](https://strikermanager.com/) was launched in May 2023. Since the launch, more than 10K users have registered into the game and we also have arround 1.100 and 1.300 DAU and 3.500 MAU. They are planning an extensive marketing campaign to drive further growth\n\n“*We've partnered with renowned esports clubs, including DUX Gaming (Spain), Team Gullit (Netherlands), Timbers Esports (Mexico) and Qlash (Italy).”*\n\n“*We also offer \"International Basketball Manager 2023\" for sale on Steam, expanding our sports gaming portfolio.”*\n\n### Additional Collaboration with Striker Manager 3 and their sister brand, International Basketball Manager:\n\n**Additional Collaboration**: In addition to financial collaboration, both parties can explore opportunities to jointly promote events and activities, such as the NBA Pick EM in collaboration with the premium basketball game community ([International Basketball Manager 23](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2098130/International_Basketball_Manager_23/)) or the Soccer Weekly Pick EM with the Striker3 and Krause House Discords.\n\n**Community Tools:**\n\nThe possibility of using Discord tools ([Mocha](https://top.gg/bot/987974524140146728)), such as a channel bridging bot, can be explored to amplify communities and encourage interaction between Striker Manager 3 and Krause House members.\n\nIt’s important to note that UPLAY Online is also developing a basketball manager web3 game. It will be similar to Striker Manager 3 but adapted to the basketball particularities. They are already working on this game and hope to launch it by the end of this year or at the beginning of the next. Krause House will be positioned to partner with this product as well.",

We are read by 12 NBA representatives, many of whom are in leadership positions, 3 from FIBA and the CEO of the British Basketball League. We are also read by Paris Basketball, London Lions, Lega Basket Serie A and many others.\n- 2) Our [podcast](https://sportingcrypto.substack.com/podcast) includes representatives from McLaren Racing, Manchester United, Brentford, Krause House, The ATP, LinksDAO and more.\n- 3) Our [events](https://www.sportingcrypto.com/events/event-three-448m9-srkzf) have been attended by some of the most influential industry leaders, including guests from Google, AWS, NBA, EPL, Polygon, Avalanche, HBAR, MLB, BBL, ThirdWeb, TikTok, Rockstar Games, Manchester City Group and more\n\n**What do we want to do with KH?**\n\n- We are hosting our biggest event yet on the 16th of November with up to 150 people attending\n- We want Krause House to become a brand sponsor of our event in NYC later this year\n- We have already had HBAR confirm as a brand partner, and are in talks with BitGo and several others to also be partners at the event.

Since that time conversations with ownership groups have expanded beyond the NBA, to groups that are excited to bring the Krause House playbook into their sport.\n\n**Details**\n\nThis proposal requests to amend the original proposal as follows:\n\n1. apply the retainer budget to acquisition opportunities in any league generating over $1B in annual revenues.\n2. pledge that the retainer will be repaid to the community from proceeds of any resulting transaction subsequently approved by the community.\n\n**Rationale**\n\nWhile Krause House began with a focus on the NBA, it is apparent that our value proposition extends across sport. Securing an LOI with any team in an elite league will be a material contribution to our mission.",

      "title": "Ball Hogs Coaching, Media, & Travel Proposal (Pt. II)",
      "content": "**Authors:** Bayesian Baller x Crabtree\n\n**Wallets:**\n\nBayesian: 0xD9b3Ad0eb0d3b9DF83CE919198F9ad0Ff692522F\n\nCrabtree: 0xeFD9740AEBfF6039322A02206e8266F70DEc10ee\n\n### TL;DR\n\nBayesian and Crabtree are requesting reimbursement for Week 7 in Charlotte and funding for Week 8 in Detroit.\n\n### Explain It Like I’m 5\n\nWhen we made the [OG proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0xf02fc5a52c9a9798b51de353e94684c94fee0fd6ce804c81cf4b33b90b53b59b), there were 6 games left:\n\n- Miami\n- Boston\n- Charlotte\n- Detroit\n- Washington DC (if qualified)\n- London (if qualified)\n\nDue to our schedules at the time, we thought we could only attend 3 games: Miami, Boston, DC\n\nHowever our schedules opened up, and we opted to attend Charlotte for our 3rd game. As such, we see two ways of interpreting this:\n\n**A) The Spirit of the Law:** Assume the spirit of the original proposal was to attend 3 games, which we did and now we would like to attend more.\n\n**B) The Letter of the Law:** Assume the details of the original proposal were to attend Miami, Boston, and DC specifically. In which case, we would like to get reimbursed for Charlotte and head to Detroit this weekend.\n\nWhile A was the intent, B is now the clearest way to think about it. As such, this proposal is to send us to Detroit this weekend and reimburse us for Charlotte last weekend.\n\n### What’s the value?\n\nFor starters, Rick and the players have specifically said they would like us to be in attendance. Uncle Jon can vouch for this. The relationship that we have established with our team is truly unprecedented. We have consistently been told that no other BIG3 ownership group has formed this kind of relationship with their coach and players and that we’re genuinely making a difference in ways that no other team had thought was previously possible.\n\nAnd truth be told, none of it would be possible without being there in-person. There is only so much that can be done from afar. The practices, the bus rides, the huddles, the bench access… that’s where the secret sauce lies. The access that we’ve been granted by Rick and the players is absolutely unparalleled and something that we should be using to our advantage for as long as we possibly can.\n\nWe have 1 more game that’s promised, but beyond that who knows! Rick and Leandro could retire after this season and who’s to say that the next regime would be open and willing to grant us the same kind of access.\n\nSo, in our admittedly biased opinions, the value lies in our ability to continue nurturing these relationships, providing positive on-court value for our team, and offering behind-the-scenes access for other members of our community.\n\nBecause, when you take a step back and look at what we’ve accomplished this season, the story is writing itself! I could be wrong, but I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the Ball Hogs are having their most successful season ever. And THAT is the story that brings us one step closer to making this crazy dream a reality!\n\n### ICYMI\n\nWe thought this was pretty cool:\n\n[Bayesian Interacting w/ the Players [VIDEO]](https://streamable.com/i30l42)\n\nThis too:\n\n[We Called Out Our Opponent's Play Before It Happened [VIDEO]](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/f590uv5m7in8fsk83tltn/Bayesian-Crabtree-Cline-Scouting.mp4?rlkey=s0or0pewia7f1kr9h2334kmud&dl=0)\n\n### **Funding Request**\n\n- Maximum amount of 2,500 USDC per trip with a maximum of 2 trips.\n- Will provide an invoice of expenses following completion of each trip.\n- Note this amount is for both Bayesian and Crabtree combined — not apiece.\n\n### **What will the funds be used for?**\n\n**To Fund:** \n\n**August 12-14 | BIG3 Week 8 in Detroit, MI**\n\n- Flights To-From Detroit\n- Hotel Room in Detroit\n- Transportation To-From Events\n- Meals Not Covered By Events\n\n**To Reimburse For:** \n\n**August 4-6 | BIG3 Week 7 in Charlotte, NC**\n\n- Flights To-From Charlotte\n- Hotel Room in Charlotte\n- Transportation To-From Events\n- Meals Not Covered By Events\n\n*Disclaimer: All flights will be standard economy/coach and we will be splitting the most basic hotel room available. We understand that this opportunity is a privilege, not a right and we will treat it as such with the utmost respect.*\n\n### **What will Bayesian and Crabtree deliver?**\n\n- Bayesian will be assisting HC Rick Barry and the Ball Hogs’ players at practice, on the bench, and in the locker room on game days, while continuing to lead all of the team’s scouting and analytics efforts.\n- Crabtree will be leading all of the weekend’s photography, videography, interviews, and media efforts capturing footage that will be used on social media and in the Ball Hogs’ Season 2 Documentary.\n\n### [Link to OG Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0xf02fc5a52c9a9798b51de353e94684c94fee0fd6ce804c81cf4b33b90b53b59b)",

The purpose of this stream is to help bring our mission home by securing the terms and capital for an evergreen investment fund, and our first elite-level transaction in the NBA or beyond.\n\n**Current Status**\n\nWe are currently engaged in elite-level investment opportunities across 3 different sports as well as with prospective investors that have interest and capacity to invest in the fund and/or individual elite-level transactions.\n\n**Results from Previous Work**\n\nLewwwk, in collaboration with Commodore, Flex, and advisors:\n\n- Led SPV raise, generating over 2x investor interest\n- Represented Krause House at key sport*crypto investor events in Los Angeles\n- Engaged and built relationships with multiple large scale investors\n- Handled ongoing Krause House Capital administration\n- Developed deck and narrative for use in Treasury Diversification\n- Met with team and league owners across sports, triaging investment opportunities\n- Supported elite team ownership and league conversations\n\n**What Changed Over the Last Stream**\n\nOver the past stream we’ve been fortunate to engage on multiple elite team ownership opportunities. While elite-level transactions can be slow and unpredictable, it has also given us time to form and deepen relationships with some of our larger prospective investors. Through those conversations we have further refined and validated our strategy and structuring, and built trust and credibility with all parties.\n\nWhile the capital climate continues to be severely constrained, we are now well positioned to move forward with multiple paths to securing our first transaction and establishing a fund that can help Krause House scale its mission across sports.\n\n**What Does Success Look Like**\n\n- Terms agreed for our first elite-team investment.\n- First close on an evergreen investment fund.\n\n**Voting Options and Determination**\n\n1. Approve\n2. Against\n3. Abstain\n\nAbstain votes are discarded. This proposal passes if option 1 (Approve) receives more votes that option 2 (Against).",

      "content": "Wallet: 0x7d8D2c8EA18f9a3Da11066f02057DAd708f97e8F\n\nAuthor: Joshua Phelps\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\nThis is a proposal to fund the *2nd Annual* Krause House (KH)/Casa de Krause x Hoops Sagrado (HS) - a DC based youth basketball cultural exchange program - Tournament and Youth Camp in San Pedro La Laguna, Guatemala. This year provides many given and potential opportunities including but not limited to showing continuity in KH’s global reach promoting basketball globally, telling unique stories on overall Guate basketball culture as well as individuals via KH socials/doc style clips, and showcasing stories of the DC youth and how KH and HS are changing lives across borders via basketball.\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\n- **$3228.00 USDC**\n\n### How will funds be used?\n\n- **Proposed Itemized budget** in Guatemalan Quetzales(q) and USD, respectively.\n   \n- Brandon Reese daily rate 300/USD x 4 - 1200 USD\n- Brandon Reese flight - 300 USD\n- 2000q - trophies for men/women champs + MVPs - 255 USD\n- 3740q - 16 personas - Hoteles Hoops Sagrado + Brandon - 477 USD\n- 3000q - 3 arbitras, 5 partidos - 382 USD\n- 2000q - announcer/DJ/fb live streaming for all games - 255 USD\n- 720q - large banner with KH/HS logos, 2nd Annual - 91 USD\n- 1700q - large boat taking Hoops kids to/from lake - 217 USD\n- 400q - small boats for local teams - 51 USD\n- Total quetzales: 25,311.20\n- **Total USD: $3228.00**\n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\n- Josh will manage the budget same as last year; it remains fairly constant with the exception of adding professional documenter/storyteller Brandon Reese.\n    1. Jerry K + Jerry R will act as team lead and submit requests to Utopia on behalf of the team.\n    2. 2/3 Gnosis Safe with the following signers: A, B, C\n    3. Upfront funding to `0x....`\n\n### Team\n\n- Josh Phelps\n- Brandon Reese\n- Mario/KH/any interested parties with remote/direction to Brandon R. and Josh on content and stories as needed; can develop a plan/agenda beforehand by meeting with San Pedro basketball camp directors and Hoops Sagrado.\n    - Examples:\n        - ESPN short with production help from Bryan Weaver https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL8Lx-M_bUU&t=12s\n        - I Am Yupik from contacts of mine https://vimeo.com/273912854\n    - Update germane to the proposal after chatting with Dluxe - outside of daily footage and content from Brandon, and mini stories regarding the camps, DC kids, Guatemalan kids and adults, and Bryan Weaver, there could be an opportunity for a follow up proposal for Brandon regarding a longer, doc style film for submission to film festivals. Perhaps funding for this could be a joint effort between KH, Hoops Sagrado, and Project Backboard - would need discussion. Potentials included below.\n        - https://tribecafilm.com/festival/espn\n        - https://wp.nyu.edu/sff/\n        - We can consult the team behind I Am Yupik on this as well, I am well connected to them: https://vimeo.com/273912854 - they submitted to:\n            - https://www.tiff.net/\n            - https://festival.sundance.org/\n            - https://docs.afi.com/\n            - https://www.shortoftheweek.com/submit/\n            - https://americanfilmshowcase.com/\n\n### Project Details\n\n**TLDR:** Budget covers at least 5 tournament games for both men and women’s teams, 2 youth camps for 100s of kids, lodging the week in San Pedro La Laguna, broadcast of games on fb live with KH logo overlayed, and countless opportunities to capture Krause House’s continued support and positive affect on the community in Guatemala plus the youth from Washington, DC. Could potentially dovetail into media opportunities in Washington, DC during Big3 playoffs (Josh is in talks with Deb/Uncle John on this.)\n\n[The 2nd Annual KH/HS tournament in Guatemala](https://twitter.com/JPh3lps/status/1556476468477448193?s=20&t=hLHOLidAZ84o4Y4yDJ0eyA) provides a chance to build on last year’s success via a focus not only on the event itself but the stories of the participants across borders. With professional content creator/basketball player [Brandon Reese](https://www.instagram.com/brandonreese24/?hl=en), founder of The Hoop Bus and collaborator with groups like Project Backboard, 5 Star Camps and KH affiliate \\, we can supercharge the content gathering and stories told. These can cover the DC youth experiencing culture outside of their own city, Hoops Sagrado founder Bryan Weaver and his 20 year journey, bilingual content with the players both women and men for whom basketball culture is woven within their own indigenous cultures, the list goes on and on. Josh Phelps will help assist all of this production beforehand, liaising with Hoops Sagrado, Krause House, San Pedro officials, and Brandon to ensure an agenda for capturing rich, powerful branded content and preparation to take advantage of any serendipitous opportunities. Content reach could also be tested in LATAM via TikTok and Instagram with Brandon or Josh posting from KH socials while geolocated in LATAM.\n\nImmediately following the trip, the DC youth will return and should be able to join Uncle John and the Pig Pen during Big3 playoffs. Bryan Weaver is connected to DC media as well, there could be some crossover opportunities perhaps re: Big3 team ownership supports local DC basketball nonprofit, etc.\n\nThere will be another large trove of photos and videos from the trip both officially from Brandon Reese and also Josh which KH can use as well.\n\n[Last year’s photos](https://share.starchive.io/ZWVkNzJhYjYtZDFiMi00YWUyLWIxZmEtOWU1ODg0MjVjZWQ5OjAxMWI3YWQ0LWM3OTYtNDU5OS1iYWVhLWI2MWY0ZTAwMzU5NQ%3D%3D)\n\n[Last year’s videos](https://share.starchive.io/ZWVkNzJhYjYtZDFiMi00YWUyLWIxZmEtOWU1ODg0MjVjZWQ5OjQ1ZTg5ZGNkLTYyNmEtNDdmMS05ZTNiLTg5ZDdiYjA2NDA0ZA%3D%3D)",

Crabtree managed a team of photographers and videographers, conducted interviews with HC Rick Barry, and assisted Uncle Jon at the Krause House-sponsored fan events.\n\nWe have received an overwhelmingly positive outpouring of feedback regarding our work in Brooklyn — particularly from Rick Barry and the players. Ball Hogs’ captain Leandro Barbosa even asked Rick if Bayesian can travel with the team to the remaining games!\n\nSubsequently, we would like to request funding to represent Krause House in the same ways at several of the Ball Hogs’ upcoming games (as well as if/when the team makes the playoffs).\n\nAnalytics impact example: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/f590uv5m7in8fsk83tltn/Bayesian-Crabtree-Cline-Scouting.mp4?rlkey=s0or0pewia7f1kr9h2334kmud&dl=0\n\n### **Funding Request**\n\n- Maximum amount of 2,500 USDT/trip with a maximum of 3 trips.\n- Will provide an invoice of expenses following completion of each trip.\n- Note this amount is for both Bayesian and Crabtree combined — not apiece.\n\n### **What will the funds be used for?**\n\n**July 21-23 | BIG3 Weekend 5: Ball Hogs vs. 3-Headed Monsters (Miami, FL)**\n\n- Bayesian Flights To-From Miami\n- Crabtree Flights To-From Miami\n- Shared Hotel Room in Miami\n- Transportation To-From Events\n\n**July 28-30 | BIG3 Weekend 6: Ball Hogs vs. Bivouac (Boston, MA)**\n\n- Bayesian Flights To-From Boston\n- Crabtree Flights To-From Boston\n- Shared Hotel Room in Boston\n- Transportation To-From Events\n\n**August 18-20 | BIG3 Playoffs: *If Ball Hogs Qualify* (Washington D.C.)**\n\n- Bayesian Flights To-From Washington D.C.\n- Crabtree Flights To-From Washington D.C.\n- Shared Hotel Room in Washington D.C.\n- Transportation To-From Events\n\n*Disclaimer: All flights will be standard economy/coach and we will be splitting the most basic hotel room available. We understand that this opportunity is a privilege, not a right and we will treat it as such with the utmost respect.*\n\n### **What will Bayesian and Crabtree deliver?**\n\n- Bayesian will be assisting HC Rick Barry and the Ball Hogs’ players at practice, on the bench, and in the locker room on game days.\n- Crabtree will be in-person leading all photography, videography, interviews, and media efforts capturing footage that will be used on social media and in the Ball Hogs’ S2 documentary.\n- Bayesian and Crabtree will plan to conduct a video podcast with at least one Ball Hogs’ player during each weekend.

      "content": "Author:  Minal Chaudhury\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\nOptimising the Krause House Instagram handles for organic community growth. \n\nGreetings,\nI'm Minal Chaudhury and I help brands, creators and companies grow on social media. Iv been working in this industry for over 3 years and have been fortunate enough to have had the early exposure of working with and learning from people who work at Instagram thereby learning how we can manipulate the Algorithm to maximize organic reach.\nI head socials at In The Lab India and have been doing the same for @inthelab and @devinthelab since September 2022. In 7 months ITL and Dev both respectively grew from 88K to 111K and 455K to 561K. I also consult socials for many multimillion Dollar companies in India eg. Nykaa, Vegnonveg, Puma India to name a few.\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\nKH India: $600/Month\n\nKH Main: $600/Month \n\nBall Hogs: $300/Month \n\nInitial Contract is proposed of 4 months and payments shall be made at the starting of the month in alignment of media agency practices. \n\nMeta Mask wallet-:\n\n0x0e6c78134f08806711FBfBE6Ca2E13cefEd2cFdE\n\n### How will funds be used?\n\nFunds shall be used as compensation for the services provided to grow all Instagram handles. \n\nIt shall be a monthly payment for as long as the contract stays active. \n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\n### Team\n\n- Minal Chaudhury\n\n### Project Details\n\n**KH India Instagram**\n\n**$600 USDT**\n\nKH India Strategy:\n\nWe aim for India since India has one of the highest viewerships globally on social media especially Instagram. Gaining organic traction and creating an Indian community will be extremely fruitful in the long run since the watch time is extremely high and most of the population has access to the internet. \n\nWe shall aim to capitalize on the high number of viewership in India when it comes to short form content via Instagram. The following strategies will be put into effect into growing a Basketball specific sports page on behalf of KH in India.\n\nRelatable and inspirational content:\nThis type of content tends to gather high number of views and followers since they are extremely storyable and shareable which comes under the strongest form of content on Instagram. I shall be making this content from scratch and ideating, conceptualising and editing the videos.\n\nHighlight Hoops:\nWe shall also feature certain hoopers and their highlight clips to make the page is the hub of Indian basketball highlights and make sure it attracts as many eyeballs as possible from the Indian hoop community.\n\nKH Original Content:\nTo stay true to the brand we shall also be posting a lot of the original KH content to make sure that a certain digital footprint of the brands presence is made in India.\nAll 3 categories of content will be made in the regional language as and when it deems fit.\n\n**KH Main Instagram**\n\nStrategy Document:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1-nYE85rKm0IjKL9Hi6a3lmFPvH5G4Z22cl_bGW3Ojcw/edit\n\n1. Algorithm work- $150\n2. Account handling- $150\n3. Content vetting- $150\n4. Ad sets-$150\n\n**$600 USDT**\n\n**Ball Hogs Instagram**\n\n**$300 USDT**\n\nI plan on optimizing the highly under-utilised content of Ball Hogs which is already out there along with the brand new content we will get from their games and make sure that correct practices, hashtags, audio and multiple other elements are included which would result in their content getting the highest level of visibility and traction. \n\nDiscord:\n\nSince very few Hoopers use discord in India so getting them there and having them active would be a whole learning curve for them which would also have to be incentivized.\nWhat we can do is that once the Kh India account gets active and gets some traction we can build a discord community off of that since it'll be all Indian audience only, so the Kh discord community can happen after a few months of starting the KH India Instagram. \n\nMeanwhile I can help manage the Ball Hogs discord as previously discussed. \n\nThe entire content discussed and explained in the documents attached shall encompass 80% fresh content and 20% recycled content from the main KH account so that the India Kh Account stays connected to its main roots and company. \n\nFinal Goal: \n\nThe main idea is to turn the existing content and the future content that KH would generate and to optimize, produce and edit it in such a way that it gets the maximum traction in order to achieve organic growth and grow the community on Instagram using the correct practices which other Instagram experts use. The current state of affairs on Instagram isn't up to mark and we are trying to change that.",

Developing Community Leads from different geographies will be key for building KH’s international presence & developing trust from these sub-communities. Note: a budget for these Community Manager candidates will come in separate proposal.\n- Fan Content Creation Hub\n    - March-May 2023 the [1st cohort of Mochi](https://twitter.com/bondwithmochi/status/1657068656105496578?s=20) netting the DAO a new energized group of fans from India & the Philippines for content creation focused on the KH Journey. [Here](https://twitter.com/bondwithmochi/status/1657068656105496578)’s the summary from the first cohort.\n    - We have been invited to run a 2nd cohort with Mochi with a focus on the BIG3 Ball Hogs and Mario intends to facilitate this cohort with 30 members from India & Philippines.\n- Social Media Management\n    - Managing KH Socials including:\n        - Engaging the basketball community via KH [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO) (2-3 posts/week)\n        - Regular KH [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/krausehouse_nba/) Posts (2-3 posts/week)\n            - Also, growing & building organic relationships with brands & influencers through our Instagram (countless DMs for BD - tough to put a # on here)\n        - KH LinkedIn posts to help grow our presence and credibility on the platform. By increasing our presense and sharing our stories on this platform we will be able to connect with more brands & professionals (2-3 posts/week drafted & shared to Shanny who is an admin of the KH LinkedIn)\n    - Ball Hogs Socials:\n        - Supporting Uncle Jon & Dluxe with the BIG3 Ball Hogs [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BIG3_BallHogs) & [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/big3_ballhogs/)\n- Community Recognition Program\n    - We’ve learned a lot about the pros/cons of platforms like Coordinape. The general thought is that Coordinape is great but can be full of friction for the average basketball fan (thinking of the 12 years old that roll through here).\n    - I will devise a plan that recognizes community members with rewards like $KRAUSE governance tokens, basketball memorbilia and shoutouts… it will be full of human touch at first but if there is a tool that fits our needs, I will onboard KH to it and manage it (maybe Shreya’s platform).\n- Partnerships\n    - Fostering relationships with new partners for KH that add value to our community and the overall KH vision (see Past Work section for an example of those partnerships already closed)\n- Community Reporting\n    - weekly community highlights & governance roundups via Jerry’s Digest [Podcasts](https://open.spotify.com/show/3gY5N7rBd4oXn6vLKIoqti) (1/week) & [Newsletters](https://jerrysdigest.substack.com/) (1/week)\n\nMario will provide weekly projects updates in #member-chat with notes on progress, blockers & support areas\n\n## ****Past Work****\n\nMario has been an early contributor since the early days of KH with an emphasis on Community Building, Onboarding & Growth. \n\nSince then, Mario has expanded his role to help impact KH in the following capacity: \n\n- **KH Partnerships:** landing alliances and building relationships with brands like [In The Lab](https://www.instagram.com/inthelab/), [Heir](https://www.instagram.com/p/CrABIn9uG3v/), [Tech Runs](https://www.instagram.com/p/ClSFiVdLCzG/) and [Every Court Can Dream / MetaHoops NFT](https://www.instagram.com/metahoops.nft/)\n- **Digital Community Management for Partners**: Assisting In The Lab & Overtime with managing their Discords for fan engagement\n- **Ball Hogs Partnerships:** landing Merch partnership & distribution with In The Lab and a larger social media rollout (pending announcement)\n- **Digital Community Consulting** with Overtime & [YNG Dreamerz](https://www.instagram.com/yngdreamerz/).

He is also the Host & Executive Producer of Around The Association, Krause House’s go-to podcast for all things basketball, which now has a show catalog fast approaching 35 episodes.\n\nFurthermore, Bayesian has some exciting new projects on the horizon for Summer ‘23 that will aim to provide exclusive membership benefits for NFT holders and hope to create a world class experience for community members while driving revenue for the DAO.\n\nThis contributor stream renewal will allow Bayesian to continue creating original content for the community, providing technical value for Krause House’s teams and prospective clients, as well as, pushing the envelope and pioneering innovative new community building experiences.\n\n**Funding Request**\n\nUp to:\n\n- 3k $KRAUSE / month\n- 3k $USDT / month\n\nPaid monthly for 4 months (May - August 2023) in arrears for May.\n\nStewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.\n\nCommunity may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.\n\n### **What will Bayesian Baller ship during Summer ‘23?**\n\n**1)** **BIG3 x OTE: Basketball Strategy & Data Analytics Collaborations**\n\nThe 2023 BIG3 campaign is fast approaching and the Ball Hogs will be taking their show on the road to some of the biggest cities in the United States from June through August!\n\nSimilar to last summer, Bayesian is looking forward to leading all of the data analytics and basketball strategy initiatives for the team. He will collaborate directly with Head Coach Rick Barry and the players, and use advanced stats / video analysis techniques to craft custom scouting reports for the team to use during games and practices.\n\nHere are some of the scouting reports and analytics projects Bayesian created for the Ball Hogs last summer:\n\n- [**Week 6 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. 3's Company**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-u9UkBi6Ff8Jv5MUnPZMSI6FnCNftpwG/view?usp=share_link)\n- [**Week 5 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Aliens**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GVBbOwzUZbk0fWGhnIJ5LuQ95x5vcNaZ/view?usp=share_link)\n- [**Week 4 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Tri-State**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KT7K4z_Ld5_fNN7wiFHdKGj9jRRuCHX4/view?usp=share_link)\n- [**Week 3 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Triplets**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rqnl7j9ybWFre9cpsK2nxl7uVRa6ohVU/view?usp=share_link)\n- [**Week 2 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Ghost Ballers**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FrvImaWGpwA7-Vwc22pMfYryWBa3doMq/view?usp=share_link)\n- [**Week 1 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Killer 3's**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10r3Fh3zGn6BwM2gn9c4SK7Q_HyxCoPac/view?usp=share_link)\n\nSome of these data-driven scouting reports - which featured unique research around shot quality, lineup analysis, and in-game strategy - were also publicly promoted by the BIG3 on Twitter to their more than 140k followers while others were circulated within the Krause House community as exclusive content for token-holders. Creating data-driven content specifically for social media will be one of the focal points of Bayesian’s efforts in Summer ‘23.\n\nAdditionally, during Spring ‘23 Bayesian began exploring Overtime Elite data and producing analytics content on behalf of our partner team, the YNG Dreamerz. This original content caught the attention of the OTE leadership team -- including their Director of Social Media, Director of Editorial Operations, Community Manager, and Social Media Manager.\n\nAfter meeting with these key stakeholders, they expressed interest in having Bayesian produce original content like this specifically for OTE’s Social Media accounts. Some ideas included videos where Bayesian whiteboards his analytics projects and films them with voice overs articulating each of his data-driven discoveries. Other ideas include producing content about not only the YNG Dreamerz but also some of the league’s other notable teams (e.g. Cold Hearts, City Reapers) and their high-profile, future NBA talent. The sky's the limit for this partnership and we’ve only begun to scratch the surface of what is possible!\n\nHere are samples of the analytics work that Bayesian produced and presented to the OTE leadership team:\n\n- [**YNG Dreamerz Analytics: Shot Quality - Expected vs. Actual Shooting Efficiency**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Ov9QhXM9S5xBWaoZ1UK1-ACBb2Xy6fU/view?usp=drive_link)\n- [**YNG Dreamerz Analytics: Shot Selection - Why All Shots Aren't Created Equally**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jFSR910I0Dv6Oaz2mfn20jhFNnBChryO/view?usp=drive_link)\n- [**YNG Dreamerz Analytics: Shot Composition - Why All Players Aren't Created Equally**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16zEy7QLr7JzVquaaR0kmIpzXnqlCgknt/view?usp=drive_link)\n\n**2) Around The Association: Content Creation & Podcasting Strategy**\n\nSince January ‘22, Bayesian has been the Host & Executive Producer of [**Around The Association**](https://open.spotify.com/show/3YadlLpwrMTOG0ecvX65bw), the official basketball podcast of Krause House DAO & the first podcast launched by a non-steward under the community's burgeoning media network.\n\nFrom day one Bayesian’s intent in launching Around The Association has been to drive community engagement, demonstrate Krause House's basketball acumen to the world, as well as, to break down the barrier to entry into Web3 and get everyday hoops fans interested in DAOs.\n\nThe Around The Association content catalog currently stands at 33 episodes deep and includes interviews with an impressive list of guests - including current and former NBA players, coaches, front office members, national media, and successful sports-tech entrepreneurs. All of whom Bayesian has educated on the mission of Krause House.\n\nHere’s a list of the episodes Bayesian has published so far in 2023:\n\n- [**S2, E13 • The Legend of Jimmy Buckets, The Finally Healthy Nuggets, The Suns Won’t Quit the Midrange, Plus LeBron & Steph Refuse to Age**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ABMvnxlY3weHT6btipSxQ?si=xK-6y_uuQ52hyiVnmsp1uQ)\n- [**S2, E12 • NBA Playoff Preview & Awards Season w/ Rob Basha & Trey Pettus**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7iZLjM57KHEHfCo6EZEvym?si=cB3VfB2MQvum6nTGLFFexA)\n- [**S2, E11 • Houston, We Have A Problem…**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4LiqzlukS8aYnx1aVSjXBT?si=oQF7EIg-SDyYlPd_tqe2vQ)\n- [**S2, E10 • And Then There Were Sixteen…**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7rHw2d5eZvr5vgfTYocqYq?si=kC1Oc8DfTk6K26rRFq4lEA)\n- [**S2, E9 • This Is March! A Tradition Unlike Any Other**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5t1IVA7iVOTBC5W8KXbIJW?si=ljoPK49rSHO9GuuBSCgrNQ)\n- [**S2, E8 • Building A Basketball Empire w/ Alan Arlt, Founder of Ultimate Hoops**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0HlKHmajZKDRRVWS1tUNMq?si=Tpp9yTDNRyCvikYMmsWZ4w)\n- [**S2, E7 • KD to Phoenix, Kyrie to Dallas, & Russ to Utah? NBA Trade Deadline Special w/ Rob Basha**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7pPfiQldfwoT2yekhGsYRL?si=U2k6MouvQ_W5fVRgorUCxg)\n- [**S2, E6 • Pac-12 After Dark, Gonzaga’s Foreign Affairs, & Houston’s Diaper Dandy w/ Crabtree**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/13I2G5a9fywj2cji4s4s0b?si=S7FZJA8mRpSIznMlptShPA)\n- [**S2, E5 • Golden State’s Ja-Dropping Christmas, Paolo Banchero’s Historic Rookie Season, & The Playoff Bound New York Knicks**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1OtOZwLIYIOMmXrQpl6dKU?si=OVOHZsiiQGmjdBJyfwiIGw)\n\nFurthermore, something that Bayesian and Crabtree experimented with during Winter and early-Spring ‘23 was creating and posting Krause House-branded Around The Association podcast clips to TikTok and YouTube. During this experiment, the content garnered an impressive amount of engagement:\n\n- **[TikTok:** 67.1k views, 4.8k likes](https://www.tiktok.com/@watchgameday)\n- **[YouTube:** 25.3k views, 681 likes](https://www.youtube.com/@watchgameday/shorts)\n\nOne of the most challenging parts of doing this at scale though was manually assembling the clips and highlight reels that get paired with the podcast audio and transcription. However! With the cutting-edge LLM technology that Peterrr is building, he and Bayesian have been discussing using his models to automate Around The Association clips for mass production and scalability across TikTok and YouTube starting as soon as Summer ‘23. This would be a massive win and allow us to push content at scale on a consistent basis. All -- of course -- with Krause House branding front and center!\n\n**3) Krause House Hoops: Pop-Up Pickup x League Exploration**\n\nBack in February, **[Alan Arlt](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alanarlt/)** was a guest on Around The Association. Alan is the Founder of Ultimate Hoops, the revolutionary basketball league that NBA-ified recreation hoops and was ultimately acquired in a lucrative deal by Lifetime Fitness.\n\nAlan and Bayesian quickly became close and have been meeting bi-weekly for the past 3 months on a vision to revolutionize the traditional rec basketball league model. Alan is adamant that the next wave of rec leagues will not be led by athletics or fitness companies, but rather by tech companies and Web 3.0 communities looking to create world class experiences for their members while driving revenue to their communities.\n\nIn turn, Bayesian and Alan have begun collaborating with Flex, Mario, and Crabtree to gain feedback and move towards making this dream become a reality for Krause House. There are two primary models being explored:\n\n- **League Approach (End Goal):** Krause House branded adult basketball league in a major U.S. city with a large contingency of existing Jerry’s. We would strike a partnership deal with a host venue in that city and launch a 6-8 team league. Similar to Ultimate Hoops, the league would focus on creating an NBA-caliber experience for its players and be fully equipped with unique features like stats, photos, and video content all hosted on an exclusive league website. To enter the league, each player/team would be required to purchase a Krause House NFT and/or pay an annual membership fee that would go to our community. In addition to access to the league, the NFT/membership fee could grant players access to an assortment of VIP perks and benefits. Think Soho House, but for recreational basketball.\n\n- **Pickup Approach (Interim Goal):** Krause House branded exclusive, pop-up pickup runs this summer in a city that the Ball Hogs will be touring. To play in the pickup runs, each player would be required to hold a Krause House NFT and/or pay a cost of entry fee for the weekend. In addition to access to the pickup run, the NFT/cost of entry fee could grant players access to the Ball Hogs game, meet-and-greets with the BIG3 players, on top of other community events. Think of NFT NYC meets Tech Runs.\n\nThe goal here would be to drive revenue for Krause House while providing tangible benefits for community members. There may be a larger, more specific proposal for this project forthcoming at a later date to compensate Alan and cover any necessary league startup fees. More to come!\n\n**Bayesian Baller’s Background & Professional Qualifications**\n\nBayesian has worked professionally in the sports industry for 5+ years, including the last 4 years as a Data Scientist / Product Manager for a leader in the basketball analytics space and the previous 2 years at the collegiate level with two major Div. 1 college basketball programs. Along the way, he has developed working relationships with a variety of influential figures in the basketball industry who he will continue to lean upon to help facilitate partnerships and opportunities for Krause House to reach their ultimate goal of NBA ownership.",

If so, add to the candidate list.\n3. **Bring the candidate list to the community for a vote. F&C would abstain from the vote. The community votes.**\n4. Elected committee executes NDAs, receives an update from F&C.\n\nWe are at step (3) of this process. The candidates are as follows:\n\n- Magnus — Jerry from the early days. Founding team member of DeFi protocol Redacted Cartel. Co-CEO of Protecc Labs, an NFT focused Market Maker.\n- Phelps — Phelps has been a fan and supporter of Krause House (KH) since buying a ticket in December 2021. Since then, he has held a tournament in Guatemala with Krause House branding and financial support, engaged fully into KH subgroup All In For Sport working to promote all sports globally with web3 tooling and IRL work, and connected KH capital team with bonafide legal experts in sports/acquisitions.\n- Shanny — Shanny is a long-time KH member and steward. She is the lead for [All In For Sport](https://allinforsport.org/) and a core member of the NFT NYC experiences team.\n- Jess — Founder of [Seed Club](https://www.seedclub.xyz/) and early Krause House advocate. Jess is an expert in consumer crypto and advises some of the most well-known tokenized communities in web3.\n- DLuxe — KH supporter since the early days, including Brand team, Vision & Vibes, NOLA and Media teams and right-hand to Uncle Jon for Season 2 Ball Hogs. Basketball \"FAN\"atic--Suns season ticket holder, NBA DFS podcaster, Top 2% NBA Top Shot and Sorare expert. Previous experience negotiating and evaluating numerous public and private transactions from both the M&A side as well as the brand side.\n- Uncle Jon — I'm Uncle Jon. Aside from being the CEO of the Ball Hogs, I specialize in community management for some of our partners like Karate Combat and OTE. I have been with the DAO for a year and look forward to the very cool ways we are approaching being a fan.\n- Bayesian Baller — Host of the Around The Association podcast and leads the community’s basketball analytics initiatives. Being a member of the Full Kimono team would allow Bayesian to craft custom content and data-driven projects specifically for teams engaged with Krause House.\n\nThe vote will occur using the “weighted voting” option. The top 3 vote getters will be added to the Full Kimono Krew, assuming execution of the doxx’d NDA. In the event that one of the winners is unable to execute the doxx’d NDA, the next highest vote getter will be asked.\n\nAs a reminder, Flex & myself will not vote in this election.\n\n### How can we improve transparency for the LOI work?\n\nWe've tried our best to maintain a balance of transparency without risking details that could sink a deal or violate any signed NDAs. This is by far one of our biggest challenges pursuing this mission as a DAO. We want to increase the transparency in this process by creating a larger group that we're \"full kimono\" with.\n\nDubbed the “LOI Transparency Committee”, we’ll establish a group of 5 additional tokenholders (including the 2 now: Lewwwk & Mario) to be updated twice per month of details including:\n\n- Which NBA teams we’re engaged with\n- The owners / executives / representatives we’re engaged with\n- High-level summaries of each material interaction\n\nEach new member of the LOI Transparency Committee will need to execute a doxx’d NDA with Krause House Capital. For reference, the Krause House Capital entity is US-based and therefore more enforceable for any breaches.\n\nThe LOI Transparency Committee will be established & a first disclosure of status will be made within 45 days upon passing of this proposal. Each member of the committee must be nominated by either Flex or Commodore, the tokenholders will vote to determine their desired members.\n\nIn the event that a LOI Transparency Committee is not established & the first disclosure has not occurred within 45 days upon the passing of this proposal, this workstream will be cancelled effective immediately. In the event that an elected member refuses to execute their NDA within 7 days, they will be removed from the LOI Transparency Committee.",

Currently, we do not require any deposit or other formal means of risk mitigation.\n\nStewards will hold the right to end the monthly reimbursement at their discretion",

Jordan Brand plans to increase even more investment in this event.\n\n## About The Authors:\n\n- Giovanese is a long-time, active KH community member with a background in sports brands, namely Jordan Brand, Nike & the NBA\n- Mario Lopes is the Community Manager for Krause House\n- Nav is the COO & Partner of [In The Lab](https://inthelab.tv/en-ca)\n- Kappazah aka Zahir Carrington is a pro player and 3 time national champion of [Princeton 3x3](https://www.instagram.com/princeton3x3/?hl=en).

      "content": "**Authors:** Commodore & Flex Chapman\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n1. Summary + Primary Goals\n2. Proposal\n3. LOI Progress\n4. Plans\n5. Retrospective\n\n---\n\n# 1. Summary\n\nCommodore & Flex Chapman are requesting to [renew their full-time charter](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0xb66d1a189921089aa3d9199eb976dfac8e69b7cdabdfd634d2d6508d7d7ac6c4). We've made incredible progress in our most important pursuit of securing a LOI with a NBA team. We received a verbal from the runner-up bidding group in the Suns sales process. We're now in deep conversations with another ownership group who sees the value in our value proposition & our vision to work with them.\n\nWe intend to try to close a deal with the ownership group & execute the details determined by their counsel, our counsel, and the NBA's counsel.\n\nIn the event the current conversations fall through or stall, we'll turn our attention to a second ownership group that we have a path to. We'd like time to be able to explore both of these avenues (close + execute w/ current or run process on next group).\n\n### Primary Goals\n\n- Execute a letter of intent for a minority position of an NBA team [LOI] (very hard)\n- Pitch more NBA owners (hard)\n- Execute a treasury diversification (hard)\n- Capitalize on meaningful partnership opportunities (hard)\n- Operate core functions of the DAO [legal, financial, community, growth, etc] (normal)\n\n---\n\n# 2. Proposal\n\n- A monthly budget of $33,334 USDC\n- Paid monthly\n- 8 months starting (in arrears) May 1, 2023, ending December 31st, 2023. Intention of 8 months is enough time to work our process on a backup team + a clean end of the year duration.\n- Contributors' stream can be cancelled at any point by the DAO via proposal, at which point future payments will cease (prorated to the day stream is cancelled).\n- We must retain 100% of our airdropped allocation of $KRAUSE balances for 2 years (as of Jan 1st, 2022) or until no longer being compensated as a full-time contributor.\n\n**Monthly Spend**\n\n| Name | $USDC | $KRAUSE |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Commodore | 16,667 | 0 |\n| Flex Chapman | 16,667 | 0 |\n| Total | 33,334 | 0 |\n\n**Commodore Wallet:** thycommodore.eth\n**Flex Chapman Wallet:** flexchapman.eth\n\n---\n\n# 3. LOI Progress\n\nWe are currently in deep conversations with a NBA team attempting to close a LOI. This is the 2nd time we've been close with an ownership group ([specifically the Suns leading bidding group](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/JUKeloohXfbbbFKad8nKw717sRYlylHwVrpncLFaiSE)). Our pitch is resonating. Our networking is getting us infront of owners (5 ownership groups to date). We're delivering compelling pitches.\n\nThis is a matter of **when**, not *if*.\n\n# 4. Plans\n\n1. What are our plans for the DAO?\n2. What’s our plan for DAO finances?\n3. How can we improve transparency for the LOI work?\n\n### What are our plans?\n\n1. **Secure a Letter of Intent:** Securing a minority position in an NBA team is the next major step in our mission. In addition, this helps plant the seeds for objective (2) and (3). This requires cultivating relationships with NBA teams and aggressive networking by this team.\n2. **Raise for KH Capital:** Work with KH Capital to close a $100m+ PE Fund. Ownership positions in sports clubs will exist within a fully KYC’d, regulatory compliant entity as ideally a sub-DAO. KH Capital provides us the ability to structure a legal entity that sports clubs can interact with legally & compliantly, while KH Capital delegates access + governance to Krause House where allowed. Additionally, this gives us negotiation leverage to verbally commit to large sums of capital without knowing KH members’ appetite due to KH Capital being able to backfill any remaining allocation. Note: Closing a LOI with a NBA team is a massive accelerant to getting this fund closed.\n3. **Community Engagement:** Our community & our ability to organically build new communities (OTE as an example) is a superpower. Sports leagues & clubs are interested in ways to partner with us. This can serve as a path to earn equity from other sports clubs as well as generate revenue. \n\n### What’s our plan for the DAO treasury?\n\nAt this moment, we have roughly $855k our [Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4762eacebdb7585d32079fdcba5bb94eb5d76f2) and [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x40eDBC75C543954CDD9c5ae7398342788F46A85B) treasuries. We believe that we should continue on course. Our biggest & most important goal of delivery a LOI feels within our grasp. If we can secure a LOI with a team, our future drastically improves as paths for monetization, treasury diversification, etc open up significantly. As voters, we're targeting a ~$75k stablecoin/mo burn to continue to drive our core theme of credibility building.\n\n### How can we improve transparency for the LOI work?\n\nWe've tried our best to maintain a balance of transparency without risking details that could sink a deal or violate any signed NDAs. This is by far one of our biggest challenges pursuing this mission as a DAO. We want to increase the transparency in this process by creating a larger group that we're \"full kimono\" with. \n\nDubbed the “LOI Transparency Committee”, we’ll establish a group of 5 additional tokenholders (including the 2 now: Lewwwk & Mario) to be updated twice per month of details including:\n\n- Which NBA teams we’re engaged with\n- The owners / executives / representatives we’re engaged with\n- High-level summaries of each material interaction\n\nEach new member of the LOI Transparency Committee will need to execute a doxx’d NDA with Krause House Capital. For reference, the Krause House Capital entity is US-based and therefore more enforceable for any breaches. \n\nThe LOI Transparency Committee will be established & a first disclosure of status will be made within 45 days upon passing of this proposal. Each member of the committee must be nominated by either Flex or Commodore, the tokenholders will vote to determine their desired members.\n\nIn the event that a LOI Transparency Committee is not established & the first disclosure has not occurred within 45 days upon the passing of this proposal, this workstream will be cancelled effective immediately. In the event that an elected member refuses to execute their NDA within 7 days, they will be removed from the LOI Transparency Committee.\n\n---\n\n# 5. Retrospective\n\n### Commodore\n\n**Highlights**\n\n- Used surprise Suns sale to drive awareness of our mission to multiple ownership bidding groups to lay foundation for future deals.\n- Networked to leading bidding group (at the time) for the Suns sale, worked our way to securing a verbal to join the ownership group. Maintaining relationship to partner in future deals.\n- Initiated KH Phillippines TikTok strategy after several attempts to inspire other Jerrys to step up & experiment. Early results have been tremendous.\n- Took the feedback from last term & significantly increased my vocal leadership.\n\n**Learnings**\n\n- Take advantage of press cycles to get into narrative + deal flow.\n- Local native content on TikTok as a strategy seemingly works.\n- Interesting soccer ownership opportunities around the world, worth exploring KH expanding into soccer.\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Being more transparent, as a voter, of my financial strategy for budget/burn/runway.\n- Finding ways to better engage the community as a collective.\n- Be more proactive in having difficult conversations with Jerrys.\n\n### Flex\n\n**Highlights**\n\n- Leveraged personal & professional connection to secure an IRL meeting with a majority owner in the NBA.\n- Developed and executed pitch strategy for multiple prospective ownership groups which resulted in a verbal offer to [join a bid for the sale of the Phoenix Suns](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/JUKeloohXfbbbFKad8nKw717sRYlylHwVrpncLFaiSE).\n- Closed premier partnership with Overtime and Overtime Elite resulting in first revenue generating project for the DAO.\n\n**Learnings**\n\n- Increasing feedback around expansion into other sports & leagues around the world.\n- Gathered insights from several hours of meetings with front office, current and prospective owners. Subsequently published [findings for public consumption](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/Npqzilp1YpqAXzRRWtI6fcfYNHuexF98JceikKFFRD0).\n- Bottoms-up initiatives such as court refurbishments, localized content creation, and digital community management all have the highest level leverage. Owners, regardless of sport, are very interested in our success across these types of projects.\n\n**Improvements**\n\n- Received feedback to exude more leadership in public forums rather than just in small tactical groups.\n- Involve more high value members in discussions and dialogue directly relating to NBA ownership conversations.\n- Leverage creative and storytelling abilities to accelerate growth of the Krause House brand.",

It’s bare bones for now, but will be built out further\n- $12,000 - Krause House Jerry Bounty\n    - I’d love to REALLY tap into the community for initiatives this summer this ranges from\n        - Social Media Videos\n        - Analytics\n        - Non-Profit Outreach and Connections\n        - General Week to week planning\n    - On the main Ball Hogs Notion page, i will link a Excel sheet for these bounties as they come up.\n\nThese spending categories are just an estimate and subject to change. There is also an effort being made to fundraise extra money through sponsorship and advertisements, particularly for the NYC event\n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\nFunds will be managed through a multi-sig to be set up after possible passing. The multi-sig will require 3/5 signatures from any of the following\n\n### Team\n\n- Uncle Jon\n- Mario\n- Commodore\n- D-Luxe\n- Crabtree\n\n### Project Details\n\nGoal: **Demonstrate the value of fractional ownership**\n\nTactics:\n\n- Efficiently distribute Courtside/VIP tickets to Jerrys\n- Target VIP guests and partners for any remaining tickets\n- Aim to form partnerships with local non-profits and AAU teams to fill the GA “Pig Pen” with members of these communities.\n\nOutcomes:\n\n- 100% Claim of courtside tickets\n- 66% claim of VIP tickets\n- 85% claim of GA tickets\n\nGoal: **Win over Big3 audiences by having best-in-class IRL fan activations**\n\nTactics:\n\n- The Pig Pen (in game)\n- Tailgate Activities (Outside of stadium pre-game and post-game)\n- Community Activations (The day prior to Ball Hogs game)\n\nOutcomes:\n\n- During games, the Ball Hogs have a noticeable representation of fanhood\n- Fans are engaged from the time they roll into the stadium and we create excitement for all game attendees\n- We give back to communities either tangibly (court refurbs and community service) or experimentally (basketball clinics, 3x3 games)\n\nGoal: **Demonstrate the value of decentralized content creation**\n\nTactics:\n\n- Create a content capture and sharing mechanism (likely through Mochi) to generate buzz about the Pig Pen on social media.\n- Designate 1 or 2 people within the DAO to monitor and post on all Ball Hogs social media\n\nOutcomes:\n\n- Generate an ever-expanding pool of social media ready media to be easily accessible by members of KH\n- Grow the Ball Hogs social media following by at least 2x over the course of the season\n- By using some of our influencer partners (In the Lab, Joy DeAngela, Evette Morales, and the Bone Collector) we would have built in methods to boost viewership likelihood.\n\n### Team Outline:\n\nUncle Jon: Project Manager and Pig Pen Operations\n\nD-Luxe: Non-profit partnership coordinator\n\nMario: ITL partnership liason, Mochi community content creation manager & Ball Hogs Social Media Support\n\nShanny: Court Refurb consultant\n\nCrabtree: Content Capture and Creation, Ball Hogs Social Media Lead\n\n### Notion Database\n\nI have made a public facing Notion database that can be viewed [here](https://www.notion.so/Ball-Hogs-2023-Dashboard-81e04be766584fc98c7d30f15cb2fc03).

      "title": "Peter Stream Request - Cross-Platform AI Strategy",
      "content": "Author: peterrr#4718\n\nWallet address: 0xBF6C4eE9441C774560b68D5ae34421d89C6F8787\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\nRequesting funding for April (partial month), May, June, and July to continue developing Krause House's custom AI products using large language models. Shifting focus from a custom-built platform to backend AI-basketball systems development in order to create an outwardly publishable media brand, currently named Jerry's Corner. Jerry's Corner aspires to revolutionize media distribution through innovative software development, utilizing advanced AI, composable technology, and real-time NBA stats and fan reactions to create dynamic, engaging content for Krause House across multiple platforms. Seamlessly integrating various distribution strategies with a unique, consistent personality, this project redefines content consumption while fostering a deeper connection between Krause House and its fans, transcending traditional media boundaries.\n\n### Requested Budget Stream\n\n- Up to $2,000 USDC and 2,000 Krause, payable at the end of April (for work done in April)\n- Up to $6,500 USDC and 6,500 Krause per month, payable at the end of May, June, and July\n\n### Stream Payment Accountability Metric\n\nTo ensure accountability throughout the project, I propose a variable compensation based on performance indicators. 3-5 high context members will rate my performance on the criteria above using a scale of 1-10. The rating level will determine by compensation level by apply the rating as a percentage to the maximum compensation level.\n\n### **Evaluation Criteria**\n\n1. Outward Media Quantity and Quality:\n    - Rate the increase in the quantity and quality of outward media on a scale of 1-10 (1 being ineffective, 10 being highly effective).\n2. Development of Platform-Specific Strategies:\n    - Rate the effectiveness of the developed strategies for each platform on a scale of 1-10 (1 being ineffective, 10 being highly effective).\n3. Real-Time Engagement and Responsiveness:\n    - Rate the success of real-time engagement with fans and responsiveness to live basketball events on a scale of 1-10 (1 being ineffective, 10 being highly effective).\n4. Overall Stream Impact on Krause House Visibility and Engagement:\n    - Rate the overall impact of the stream on contributing to Krause House's growth, visibility, and engagement on a scale of 1-10 (1 being ineffective, 10 being highly effective).\n\n### **Protections**\n\n- Stewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.\n- Community may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.\n\n### Previous Project Details\n\nAs of today, my previous Krause-funded project successfully created the following: a Jerry chatbot with a jailbroken model, dynamic visual outputs, and integrated both quantitative and qualitative information through dynamic API calls, resulting from complex natural language parsing of user messages. A demo can be found here: [https://box-score.peterbergin.repl.co](https://box-score.peterbergin.repl.co/)\n\nFurthermore, I have initiated the development of a ChatGPT plugin featuring similar functionality to the aforementioned application.\n\nI also tested an early version of a Twitter bot capable of understanding current NBA playoff games and producing outward media. This test serves as a proof of concept for the proposed project direction and was published on my personal [Twitter account @peterjbergin](https://twitter.com/peterjbergin) (where you can view the tweets). Tweets were automatically generated through dynamic dataflows on April 24th to 27th as a quick assessment of reach and functionality. The test demonstrated both the ability to generate topical tweets and increase engagement by live-tweeting about relevant game events, all without any human intervention.\n\nHere are some key data points from the experiment:\n\n- Personal follower count: 197\n- Tweets generated: 62\n- Total Impressions: 6240\n- Average Impressions: 100.6\n- Max impressions: 223\n\nPlease note that these numbers may not accurately represent potential engagement, as my account is not solely followed by basketball fans. The content is not tailored to my direct followers and would likely be viewed mainly by non-followers.\n\n### Project Details\n\nThe proposed project, currently named Jerry's Corner (name pending), aims to create a consistent, branded media distribution strategy across various social platforms and distribution channels by leveraging the highly composable nature of the technology. This strategy includes utilizing Twitter and newsletters for written content; TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram for video content; and all podcast platforms for voice content. Featuring a unique personality and a consistent voice across all channels, the project seeks to maximize engagement and reach for Krause House.\n\nThe rationale for using multiple platforms and distribution angles is the inherent composability of the backend technology. Developing one distribution angle enhances the next. This project involves creating data flows, building models to analyze fan-generated qualitative data, and constructing autonomous AI agents to generate and find data, which helps improve the overall quality across all platforms.\n\nAlthough numerous platforms are listed, the project will focus on developing a specific distribution strategy for each platform sequentially. The order may change as needed, but the current plan is as follows:\n\n1. Develop a Twitter bot to tweet about live games, respond to popular tweets, and discuss trending NBA topics, as an NBA analyst would. This lays the groundwork for short-form text generation. As demonstrated above, this work is nearly complete.\n2. Develop video flows for short-form vertical videos to be posted on TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram.\n3. Develop conversational bot abilities through direct messaging capabilities of social platforms, similar to the custom platform built (see above), but using social platforms as the user interface.\n4. Develop long-form written content about the NBA to be published on Twitter and as an email newsletter.\n5. Develop a short or long-form podcast distribution strategy to be published using text-to-voice AI software.\n\nAs these strategies are developed, there will be a major focus on maintaining and improving existing automated distribution flows based on engagement and impressions data. The composable nature of this technology allows for the creation of a dynamic media distribution system featuring our own KH personality, Jerry.\n\nThis project offers multiple benefits: it allows me to explore the creativity of building a software-based product with LLMs, increases distribution and engagement for Krause House across multiple mediums (5k impressions in a small-scale test), showcases KH talent through dynamically engaging fans with real-time live basketball media, and enables us to pursue the highest potential value approach.\n\n### **Mention of additional project in KH**\n\nIn my performance-based compensation structure, I mentioned potential work for KH not directly related to this project. This could involve assisting efforts in the DIO to improve operations, as I have done previously and as will be needed in the near future. Additionally, it could include side projects such as helping build AI-based bots for KH onboarding, governance, and more, which have been recently workshopped.\n\n### Leadership Position: Strengthening Teamwork and Participation\n\nIf this proposal is approved, I will take on a leadership role to enhance teamwork and encourage active involvement from all members. In the past, many of our projects have been carried out in silos, which has limited our ability to work together and share ideas. To address this, I plan to promote open communication and cooperation among all participants and establish connections with other funded projects to explore synergies and collaborative opportunities.\n\nMy goal is to establish a clear and accessible way for everyone to contribute their thoughts and skills to the project. By working together, we can combine our strengths and achieve better results than we would by working alone.\n\nIn short, as a leader, I will focus on building a collaborative environment where each person's voice is valued and their contributions are recognized. Through teamwork and participation, we can move our project forward and reach our shared objectives.\n\n### **Voting Options and Determination**\n\n1. Approve\n2. Against\n3. Abstain\n\nAbstain votes are discarded. This proposal passes if option 1 (Approve) receives more votes that option 2 (Against).",

He was the creator of the [Uncle Jon Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zfDKaSW2vV4&list=PLlhzSeLttOpV1d8ipHWLm2kGPiEqtO9zw&index=2), a documentary on our first seasons of being team owners. This involved travel to six BIG 3 games and other locations.\n\nHe also was the in-house photographer for NFT.NYC, co-hosted NBA [watch parties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1SlgH9zHBg&list=PLlhzSeLttOpVJZARg-BFX8dHeomgwqtWL),  created a variety of [social content](https://www.instagram.com/p/ClmU1vgDY8S/), and designed [the onboarding videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlhzSeLttOpUpFMSn34LS1Zi89nwHQX1o) to support the community.\n\nThis stream will allow us to continue creating original media approaches for the community and providing talking points of value in external conversations.\n\np.s. I want to emphasize the Ball Hogs storytelling is the majority of the monthly work in this proposal. \n\n# Project Description & Deliverables\n\n**Season 2 of Ball Hogs / The Uncle Jon / Krause House Ownership Story**\n\nDocumenting Season 2 of our ownership model focusing on Uncle Jon’s second run as CEO. This would call for a wide range of content capture before and during the season, and finding some unique narratives on Krause House’s evolution over the years.\n\nThe goal is to have a more holistic view of the Ball Hogs x KH (with Uncle Jon as main character). Content deep-dives and short form clips with players, coaches, fans, other Jerrys and Uncle Jon will be provided to the broader KH community. Ultimately this will all funnel up to having another, this time longer, documentary on owning a sports team.\n\nWould involve some travel to Alabama and BIG 3 cities. I would also manage freelance video resources for weeks that didn’t call for travel that align with Uncle Jon’s needs.\n\nOutcome(s)\n\n- Capturing real work and real impact by a Jerry of Jerrys\n- Build on native storytelling ability\n\n**Analytics-to-Content with Bayesian Baller**\n\nOngoing work with Bayesian Baller on a series of analytics-to-content projects to be used for greater KH community and external conversations. Example project would be Ball Hogs preview, projections, and in-season analysis.\n\nContent would be specifically designed for TikTok, IG, and YouTube consumption.\n\n****************Greater Media Support****************\nThis isn’t factored into more compensation, this is more offering up being an expert resource to capture more stories via video for active Jerrys in this “The Time Is Now” phase. Whether it be 3x3 tournaments or tools being built, we are underutilizing this area.",

In less than two years, [we’re on the doorstep](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/JUKeloohXfbbbFKad8nKw717sRYlylHwVrpncLFaiSE), and have learned a lot about [the value community can bring to ownership](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/Npqzilp1YpqAXzRRWtI6fcfYNHuexF98JceikKFFRD0) in the NBA, and professional sports more broadly.\n\nThis phase of the capital coordination stream is focused in on executing our first transactions and preparing to scale community-driven ownership across professional sports.\n\n**Results from Previous Work**\n\nThrough work completed under the previous capital coordination streams Lewwwk, in collaboration with Commodore, Flex, and advisors: \n\n- designed an evergreen, multi-strategy investment platform, including compliant tokenization options for Fund 1 and future capital strategies\n- handled administration of Krause House Capital including compliance registration and initial transaction infrastructure setup\n- managed relationship with key advisors Luis Vicente and Michael Broughton\n- engaged with team and league owners across sport, including pitch materials for Krause House community management services\n- facilitated an introduction to an incoming NBA owner\n- supported transaction readiness for two NBA ownership positions\n- secured initial investment interest in fund, SPV, and NBA ownership opportunities\n- secured NBA transaction counsel\n- hosted weekly #dio-chats for interested members\n- supported exploration of external capital options and spin-out strategies for [HeatCheck](https://heatcheck.club/); development of [All In For Sport](https://allinforsport.org/); and the Future of Sport roadmapping project\n\n**What Changed Over the Last Stream**\n\nOver the past stream we found ourselves on the doorstep of ownership as market conditions continued to deteriorate into the worst capital raising market in over a decade.\n\nIn response, attention shifted toward preparing and supporting potential NBA ownership positions; adapting the fund strategy; and accelerating work to bring the first SPV to our community to demonstrate what Krause House ownership will look like across sport. \n\n**What Does Success Look Like**\n\n- An LOI signed for a minority ownership position in an NBA team\n- Our first SPV complete for community investment into a sport team outside the NBA\n\n**Voting Options and Determination**\n\n1. Approve\n2. Against\n3. Abstain\n\nAbstain votes are discarded. This proposal passes if option 1 (Approve) receives more votes that option 2 (Against).",

      "title": "The Krause House Writers Cohort",
      "content": "The Krause House Writers Cohort\n\nAuthor: grant#2959\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\nKrause House partners with Taptive to run a 3-week white-labeled writing program (ex: the KrauseHouse Writers Cohort). The program will achieve two goals: \n\n1. It will create dozens of community-generated blog posts\n2. It will serve as a community engagement tool for new and existing community members\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\n$3,000 USDC \n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\nThe funds will be sent to grant#2959 to plan, develop, and operate the program\n\n### Project Details\n\n**Summary:**\n\nKrause House to partner with Taptive to plan, develop, and operate a 3-week cohort-based writing program for the community.\n\nParticipants will write and publish a 500-word post every week for 3 weeks. Each week, participants will meet live on Zoom to share their writing, give and receive feedback, and connect.\n\nBy the end of the cohort: \n\n1. Krause House will have dozens of articles shared by the community creating thousands of impressions. These posts can be featured on Krause House newsletters, blogs, and social media\n2. Members of the Krause House community will have built new relationships with others in the community\n3. Community members will have gained an invaluable growth experience as a result of their affiliation with your community\n\nTaptive has run 30 cohort-based writing programs for over 15 organizations helping writers publish 1,000+ essays.\n\n# Extra Information (can remove for the final proposal if necessary)\n\n## **Our Process**\n\nOur step-by-step process to plan, develop, and operate a successful cohort for Krause House\n\n## **Strategy and Planning**\n\n### **📈 Build a program that works for you**\n\nWe start the process with a Project Launch call with the KH team. \n\nDuring this call, we'll better understand how to message the program to the community, and we'll discuss potential customizations you want to make to the program.\n\nAlso, we will agree to a cohort Kickoff date and time that works for your community.\n\n### ✍️ Writing Prompts and Cohort Theme\n\nWe will work with the Krause House team to give writers prompts and a theme that furthers Krause House’s mission. \n\nSome example prompts and themes: \n\n- Analyze the Ball Hogs’ potential for a successful season\n- Summarize Krause House’s mission and next steps\n- Summarize Krause House DAO’s podcast episode #47\n- Share details of the Krause House and Ball Hogs relationship\n\n## **Marketing**\n\n### **📢 Bring the community together**\n\nNext, we'll design a landing page for the program. \n\nWe will provide you with the landing page, additional copy to use on social media, and a multi-channel marketing plan to start to get the word out.\n\nHere's an example of a [past landing page](https://thecommonswriters.carrd.co/).  \n\n## **The Cohort Experience (from the writers perspective)**\n\n### **👋 Onboarding**\n\nTaptive will run its tested onboarding process to start the cohort. Onboarding is critical to the cohort experience as it communicates the goals, expectations, process, and logistics required to align all cohort participants.\n\nAlso, onboarding will include an invite to the Krause House Writers Cohort Learning Home created by Taptive.\n\nThe Learning home includes all resources participants will use during the cohort. *(Leaderboard, Calendar, Cohort & Feedback Champion Competitions, Feedback Guide, Feedback Form, Live Meeting Recordings, Taptive’s The Publishing Process, >20 pages of Taptive Writing Tips).*\n\nWe've created over 20 pages of content to help writers write. You can read examples of the [content here](https://www.notion.so/All-Writing-Resources-7f80f7afd8d44dc6a584f4af6fc02e81). During the cohort, this content is shared with writers in a daily, digestible format.\n\n### **🚀 Kickoff Meetup**\n\nOn the last day of Onboarding, Taptive will lead a Kickoff Meetup to start the cohort. We’ve run many Kickoff meetings and have an agenda that supports people in the writing journey.\n\n### **💬 Community Channel**\n\nAsynchronous discussion is an important part of the cohort experience. Cohort participants will chat in a separate channel in the Krause House Discord.\n\nTaptive will facilitate discussions in the channel. \n\n### **📆 Cohort Weekly Cadence**\n\nOnce the cohort is launched, the cohort will run on a consistent, weekly cadence. This is intentional — the more simple the weekly cadence, the more writers can focus on writing.\n\nHere is an example weekly cadence (though this will likely change based on our agreed-upon schedule):\n\n1. Friday: Each writer sends their writing topic for the week to the Discord channel and writes a Bullet Draft of their weekly post\n2. Wednesday: Each writer publishes their post (and shares it on Discord and social media)\n3. Thursday: Each writer attends the Weekly Live Meetup on Zoom and gives feedback to others in the cohort\n\nTaptive ensures that writers are able to follow this cadence by sending a Weekly Summary with links throughout the week.\n\n### **🤝 Live Meetups**\n\nEach week, Taptive will organize a space to meet live on Zoom. These Live Meetups last 1 hour and take place on the same day and time each week of the cohort.\n\nThe focus of the Live Meetups is 1:1 feedback on writing and community discussion (based on the previous week’s writing).\n\nTaptive has a minute-by-minute agenda for these meetings. However, prior to the meetings, we will work with your team to determine the best use of time for the meetings.\n\n### **👋 Cohort Conclusion**\n\nThe cohort concludes with the live Celebration Meetup following the publication of the final post.\n\nDuring Celebration Meetup, among other activities, Taptive will announce the winners of our Cohort Champion Awards and the Feedback Champion Award.\n\nAlso, participants will complete a reflection survey and share personal wins from the experience.\n\nFollowing the Celebration Meetup, Taptive will send a final email of the cohort sharing the award winners and the next steps.\n\n## **Wrap Up**\n\n### **🏆 Conclusion Meeting**\n\nAfter the cohort concludes, Taptive and the Krause House team will debrief on the cohort.\n\nTaptive will prepare a deck to share data from the cohort.",

This is a great opportunity to inform the future of the computer science industry about web3, DAOs, and how both can change the face of how sports are run.\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\n- 815 USDC\n\n### How will funds be used?\n\nFlight from ATL -> NYC: $490\n\nTransit (ride from airport into NYC and returning + subway card) -> $230.00\n\nAirport Parking: $95.00\n\nTotal Ask: $815\n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\nBy Uncle Jon with supervision from Shanny\n\n### Project Details\n\n**What is it?**\n\nThe NYC Computer Science Opportunity Fair (CS Fair) is the largest annual college and career inspiration event for public high school students studying computer science in New York City. This event is part of Fred Wilson's philanthropic work with Gotham Gives. The 2023 CS Fair will take place on April 25, 2023, at the 168th Street Armory. More than 2,000 students are expected to engage with companies, interact with computer science organizations, and learn about educational opportunities at colleges and universities. The event will include interactive activities, an \"interview experience,\" emerging tech such as AI, videos, robots, and even dancing!\n\n**Why Krause House?**\n\nThe CS Fair contacted us to represent web3 and DAOs in the event's \"emerging tech\" room, which showcases other web3 and AI initiatives. As basketball is a significant part of NYC students' lives, the CS Fair is very excited to have us participate and demonstrate how sports and web3 can be combined.\n\n**Goals:**\n\n1. **Purpose:** To inform the upcoming generation of those interested in a tech career about web3 and how they can participate.\n\n**Tactics:**\n\n- Create an informative booth that explains what a DAO is and how Krause House aims to make fractionalized ownership and fan involvement the way of the future of sports.\n- Showcase our involvement in Big3, OTE, and Karate Combat, including:\n    - Ball Hogs Documentary and fan engagement\n    - Gameday\n    - OTE Discord Server\n2. **Purpose:** Leverage our unique goal to attract future tech workers to Krause House and web3 contributions.\n\n**Tactics:**\n\n- Through our booth, swag stickers, and immersive education, guide those interested in KH on how to get involved.\n    - Heat Check: [https://www.instagram.com/p/ClmFyBIpnQ0/](https://www.instagram.com/p/ClmFyBIpnQ0/)\n- Introduce Mochi and Heat Check.\n- Demonstrate that the career path of web3 is a \"choose your own adventure\" path and welcome them into the DAO.",

Stewards have the highest context within the DAO given their role to validate proposals.\n\n********************What is a kTx Signer?********************\n\nA kTx Signer is a member of Krause House’s transaction team or alternatively stated a signer on the multi-sig. \n\n**Why make this change?**\n\nDuring the USDC depeg, the kTx Team needed to move with urgency to mitigrate the treasury’s risk. This opened up a conversation of who should be on the kTx Team & what type of context they should have. There was consensus at a recent Stewards Meeting that the highest context members of the DAO are Stewards and therefore we should mandate that all kTx Signers are also Stewards.\n\nIt should be noted that at this time it is undetermined if Stewards should ****also**** be kTx Signers.\n\n******************************What is a norm?******************************\n\nA norm is a principle that guides the direction of the systems we build. The intention behind using norms is to create rules that are flexible & generalized to maximize the pursuit of our mission.",

We had 100% of our stablecoin allocation in USDC. Banks collapsing made USDC dip significantly in value, emergency treasury management actions were taken to save the treasury. We now have a blend of USDC, USDT, & DAI. For all intents & purposes, these stablecoins are all roughly the same; each with their unique pros & cons. \n\nThis proposal is to grant a new permission the kTX team processing payments via Utopia to send out payouts in a stablecoin of their choice.\n\n### Why make a proposal for this?\n\nEach proposal that requests stablecoins, has historically been written to request USDC. In practice, the author typically is implying a stablecoin pegged at $1 USD rather than the technical request of the USDC token.\n\nNow that our treasury is more diverse, it will be more cost effective to manage the treasury diversification against the goal of stabilizing the treasury rather than catering to a governance technicality of paying in USDC. \n\nSaid differently, the spirit is to pay a stablecoin pegged at ~$1.00 USD.",

To ensure the same level of signer difficulty on the multisig treasuries, I’m nominating Shanny as my replacement.\n\n**Commodore’s Appraisal of Shanny**\n\nDuring the USDC depegging, we had to make emergency treasury diversification movements. At that time, we were fortunate that Magnus was available. In this particular scenario — Shanny was available to help execute transactions, had the necessary context, but was unable to assist with executing transactions due to not being a signer.*\n\n*Note: This is less true given that Eli has requested removal from the kTx Team. \n\nShanny has demonstrated value as a Steward and she would be an excellent signer on the multi-sig. \n\n**CURRENT:**\n\n**Multisig: 4/6 Gnosis Safe**\n\n- Commodore\n- Flex Chapman\n- Mario Lopes\n- Eli\n- Lewwwwk\n- Magnus\n\n******************PROPOSED:******************\n\n**Multisig: 4/6 Gnosis Safe**\n\n- Commodore\n- Flex Chapman\n- Mario Lopes\n- Lewwwwk\n- Magnus\n- Shanny",

      "content": "H-O-G Project Budget \n\nAuthor: Mario Lopes\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\nRequesting 1 ETH to sponsor Content Creators so we can test out a fan content creation system, incentivized through staking and earning crypto.\n\n1 ETH would sponsor roughly 12-20 content creators from Philippines and India to spread the good word about KH & the BIG3 Ball Hogs.\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\n1 ETH to 0xC4F8361c7d19DF414fa387F6227FC6Ecb6d8D1be\n\n### How will funds be used?\n\nTo sponsor international content creators to create daily content about Krause House and the Ball Hogs\n\n### Project Details\n\nRequesting 1 ETH to sponsor international content creators for the KH Content Creator hub we are launching in partnership with [Mochi](https://mochi.game/), Mike Swift & [In The Lab](https://inthelab.tv/en-ca)\n\n**How it works:**\n\nHere’s a link to a [detailed deck](https://pitchdeck.hypermatic.com/slides/lftuwmkl32487). Password: gohogs\n\n- Content creators will enter the \"H-O-G\", a new content creation contest powered by web3, by staking their ETH\n- For the initial run, the majority of content creators are from Philippines & India, so to reduce onboarding friction, we will sponsor these international content creators by backing each of them with ETH\n- The contest is powered [Mochi](http://mochi.game), a sticky coordination game, to create short, shareable clips out of a pool of content.\n- We’ll be sharing KH, Ball Hogs & In The Lab exclusive content each week.\n\n**The Rules of the Game**\n\n- Participants will join teams of 2-4 players to clip and post one TikTok daily. By posting one TikTok daily, they can EARN $OP but… if they don’t post a daily TikTok, they get their ETH slashed. 50% of the slashed ETH will go back to the KH Treasury and the other 50% will go to Mochi for their services.\n\n**What content creators can EARN by playing the game:**\n\n- 12 [**$OP**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/optimism) and 4 $MOCHI to players (~$25 per day/person)\n- 1 [**$OP**](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/optimism) to the Krause House treasury (~$2.50 per day/person)\n- **Weekly prizes**: 50 $OP to the highest performing posts (weekly)\n- **Grand prize:** 500 $OP to the highest performing accounts (cumulative)\n\n**Risks**\n\nThere is a chance that we get low quality posts throughout this project since the coordination game emphasizes more about “habits” > quality. Luckily, through our partnerships with Mike Swift and In The Lab we reduced these risks. Mike & In The Lab have graciously offered to provide their trained content creator teams for this project.",

Hogan Lovells is a global law firm with [deep experience in sport](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/industry/sports-media-and-entertainment). In particular, they have served both owners and acquirers in the NBA and have close relationships with the league. \n\nIt’s worth noting that our prior legal expenditures have been focused on Krause House DAO’s structuring which is a different skill set & experience than executing a NBA deal.\n\n### Use of Funds\n\nThese funds will be used to pay the firm’s retainer upon signing an engagement letter with the firm. That retainer will then be applied strictly to work related to acquisition of an NBA ownership position. \n\nThe relationship will be managed by Lewwwk in collaboration with Jerrys who possess the permission to represent KH in negotiations (currently Flex Chapman & Commodore) in an effort to secure an NBA ownership position.",

Uncle Jon here. \n\nI am requesting $8000 USDC / month and 1000 $KRAUSE a month for 6 months beginning April 1, 2023 and ending Sept. 31, 2023.\n\nThis contributorship/retainer will be full-time and cover several different departments. \n\n- primary focus will be ideating with the community and preparing for Season 2 of the Ball Hogs Pig Pen.\n- Additionally, I will continue to expand our community-run fan engagement experiments through our current partners, Overtime Elite and Karate Combat, while exploring options in other digital communities.\n\nIn our pursuit of NBA team ownership, Krause House's most relevant value proposition is the ability to rally fans into an enthusiastic online collective. Working alongside other stewards and our core team, my intention is to continue expanding our portfolio of successful projects, hoping that \"Krause House\" will be the first name that comes to mind for those seeking a strong and passionate internet fanbase. I’ll also continue to become master “Adobe-Wan Kenobi” and create digital assets for us to use in the expansion of our social media presence.\n\n# The Project Deets\n\n### Big3 Ball Hogs Preparation:\n\nThe Big3 season is scheduled to officially kick off in June. This summer, the league is returning to its traditional touring style format, playing games at various venues across the Eastern U.S. Despite only having about a month of preparation, we were able to catch the attention and approval of the league and Mr. Ice Cube. This was a huge feat in and of itself. This year, TIME IS ON OUR SIDE BABY! We have 3 months to plan and execute on what is arguably a much bigger stage.\n\n********************************************What needs to be done:********************************************\n\n- Coordination with the league to get specifics on scheduling and where we can plug in\n- Assembling a 1/2 Nationwide team of Jerry’s to show up and help execute pre-game hype for the Hogs.(sorry West Coast 🙁)\n- Building partnerships with non-profit organizations and AAU teams in each city the Big3 will be visiting\n- Finishing editing and production of the Uncle Jon Podcast and aligning on content capture and creation for 2023 (lookin’ at you @Crabtree)\n- And a bunch of other stuff that is bound to come up 🌎\n\n### Very Rough Pig Pen Operations Estimate:\n\n- Travel: 14k\n- Lodging: 8k\n- Assistant Budget: $5k\n- Supplies: $10k\n- Total = $37k\n\nThis is suuuuper rough. It could easily be scaled down or scaled up depending on what sort of activities we plan.\n\n### Continuing Digital Community with our current partners (Karate Combat & Overtime Elite)\n\nThis winter, we established two great partner deals with Karate Combat and Overtime Elite, two fantastic sports organizations. With Overtime Elite, Mario and I started a Discord server for OTE team YNG Dreamerz. Essentially, we were international online basketball summer camp counselors (check out my LinkedIn).  What makes this project particularly cool is that we were initially brought on with the agreement that we would likely end our partnership at the end of the season. However, Overtime was so impressed with our work that they have kept us on for the offseason, and anticipate scaling up significantly next season (Fall 2023).\n\nWith Karate Combat, I produced and hosted a podcast to help explain what an MMA league embracing a DAO governance model means for its fans. This project was fantastic, and in summary, I worked with the league's founders and legal team to explain web3 concepts to people who know very little about web3. \n\n********************************************What needs to be done:********************************************\n\n- Offseason Discord monitoring with the occasional fan activation for Overtime Elite\n- Around June, we will circle back with Overtime and begin planning next season\n- Releasing the already recorded Karate Combat episodes over the next 5 weeks (first one drops Mar 16)\n- Beginning production on the Podcast’s second season\n\n### Adobe-Wan Kenobi\n\nOver the past few months I have been GRINDING away in attempts to become the DAO’s media creation king 👑. It’s a slow moving choo-choo train, but we’re getting there. \n\n********************************************What needs to be done:********************************************\n\n- As Mario and Dbag scale out our online presence and social media involvement, I will assist in edits because everyone knows that “many hands make light work.”\n\n### Working with Lewwwk to explore community services for teams\n\nAt Krause House we have an interesting opportunity to use what we’ve learned helping other online sports communities. This is not only valuable for cap table presentations on what we offer to mid to small-market teams, but also, it brings a little $$ cha-ching into the treasury. We plan to explore this opportunity a bit more moving forward. Other than that this project is in its “early days” era, but stay tuned.\n\n********************************************What needs to be done:********************************************\n\n- standardizing our team offering\n- templating our team and community onboarding\n- signing out next team partnerships\n\n# The WHY?\n\nAccording to [Commodore's update](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/JUKeloohXfbbbFKad8nKw717sRYlylHwVrpncLFaiSE), we nearly became minority owners of the Suns. To illustrate this, let's use a baseball analogy:\n\n- We’re at the plate with a 3-1 count, one out, and a runner on second.\n- We’re down one run, probably in the 7th inning. We've faced this pitcher before and we're confident that he's going to throw a juicy fastball right down the middle.\n- Our average against him on fastballs in that part of the zone is .450, which is pretty good, but we could still strike out.\n\nThere are arguments to be made for both swinging big in a batter's count, or being safe and risking a strike by taking the pitch, which would bring us to a full count with less certainty than before the last pitch.\n\nAs a community, we are CLOSE and it should be noted that in order to help whichever team we end up with, we need to continue strengthening our online community building muscle. I like to think of that muscle as my quads, so I'm in the gym hitting a million deadlifts. \n\nBoth projects I've been involved with, between the Big3 and OTE/KC and the Philippines court refurb, have showcased in-real-life and digital fan experiences, and as a community, we've done fantastically with both. Let's keep our foot on the gas, my dudes and lady dudes.\n\n# Proposal\n\nRecipient: itsunclejon#7365\n\n0xF65f8fc7240999B192DaA081Dfa8Cd02bF3DCCe1\n\nUp to:\n\n- 1000 $KRAUSE / month\n- 8000 USDC / month\n\nPaid monthly for 6 months.\n\nStewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.\n\nCommunity may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.\n\n**### bUt SomEb0dY m1gHt t@kE t0o mUçh**Both the community and the Stewardship team has the power to cancel this stream if it is being abused.  In addition, if a contributor abuses this trust, they are effectively burning their social credibility and ability to successfully submit proposals in the future.  We expect some lossiness; however, we believe the benefits of getting good work off the ground is worth this small cost.",

      "content": "Donate additional funds upon NBA player claiming the 50 pt Charity Bounty\n\nAuthor: Mario Lopes#2725\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\nThis proposal is a follow up to acidisantana’s “[Provide Funding for a 50pt NBA Game Bounty](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0xea4e4151cb0e673b525829fd9e3011cd703cf3715c45803936e9fc36866ec748)”\n\nFor context to KH members, on Jan 23 2023, the  “[Provide Funding for a 50pt NBA Game Bounty](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0xea4e4151cb0e673b525829fd9e3011cd703cf3715c45803936e9fc36866ec748)” proposal passed and KH funded $1000 worth of ETH to the charity bounty on [Juicebox](https://juicebox.money/v2/p/436)\n\nSince then, KH has reached ~1.83 ETH (~$2,800) and some NBA players have scored 50+ pts in a game.\n\nI am asking for KH to donate an additional USDC or USD equivalent so that we bring the total donations raised to to $7,100 TOTAL . The donation will be on COMPLETION of the charity deal by whichever NBA player claims the bounty first. Example. if we have $3k claimed tomorrow by an NBA player for their charity, KH will donate an additional $4.1k to TOTAL $7.1k\n\n**Why would we do this?**\nKH’s 50pt charity bounty project has started to receive high profile attention and support including:\n\n- Jesse Pollak - Coinbase’s Head of Protocols\n- Juicebox’s entire team\n- Mainstream sports media outlets\n- Some NBA players interested in claiming the bounty\n\nDonating additional funds will showcase our commitment to the NBA players charity and also demonstrate the power of our global basketball community. For example, if given the option “KH donated $3k to xyz NBA player” vs “KH donated $7.1k to xyz NBA player,” the latter is a better demonstration of a 6000+ global basketball community and its power to do good.\n\nAlso this additional donation will have the potential to drive further viral donations from members of the web3 community to whichever NBA player claims the bounty. We can frame the announcement as:\n\n\"Our DAO will be providing another $_k to the foundation on top of what was originally raised. We want to express our appreciation of {PLAYER} helping us prove that web3 is a powerhouse for decentralized coordination. We encourage other members of the web3 ecosystem to also consider donating in appreciation. This can be done via {player donation URL}.\"\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\nKH to donate the remaining USD difference and bring the total raised to $7.1k USD for the players charity\n\n### How will funds be used + Clause\n\nThe funds will be sent to the NBA player’s charity of choice upon claiming the initial 50pt NBA Game Charity Bounty from Juicebox.\n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\nFunds will be sent by KTx team to the NBA player’s charity of choice.",

      "content": "Project Build Sprint\n\nAuthor: peterrr#4718\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\n5-week sprint funding through the end of March to prove out long-term viability of LLMs project buildout with the end vision of unique fan/community generated analytics and insights for a future NBA franchise.\n\nThis is a modified resubmission of a previous proposal: [https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x4befc724eb167683a1d28b2be07f1aef6c13f4ca27388f1ac625081ba77e24a9](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x4befc724eb167683a1d28b2be07f1aef6c13f4ca27388f1ac625081ba77e24a9)\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\n- 12,500 Krause payable at end of March\n\nwallet: 0xBF6C4eE9441C774560b68D5ae34421d89C6F8787\n\n## Project Details\n\nAfter feedback from various high-context members, I am focusing this sprint on one singular path with a clear vision. The end vision focuses on enabling a new implementation of data analytics in basketball and across sports, fan-enabled analytics. Large language models allow entities to turn language, conversation, and dialogue from unstructured data into actionable insights. As it relates to Krause House, with a unique data layer, we would be able to execute actionable insights for NBA teams such as an international / youth scouting network, individual and team scouting reports, and gameplay design including custom plays and strategies all enabled by fans and simple language.\n\nWhile this serves as the grand vision, this proposal narrows focus on the first step to prove the viability of the project long term. The value is the data layer, meaning we must create an application that enables the collection of this text data to further turn into actionable insights. While there are many strategies, this proposed strategies focused on creating a unique application through LLMs which encourages participation and therefore data collection.\n\n**Project Stages:** This proposal is only for the first Stage 1 but I want to outline long-term stages to show value in the first iteration, product building which enables the first data layer.\n\n1. Conversational Basketball Application - A “jailbroken”, strong personality application that can cover all NBA topics, and knows all up-to-date stats, facts, and scores. Like DAN for Jerry’s by Jerry’s. Like Bill Simmons meets Stephen A Smith meets the Terminator, all with superior basketball knowledge. The intention is to push the boundaries of entertainment and LLM-based insights. This gives us the reps to start exploring LLMs for Krause House and enables us to begin sourcing fan opinions and content all while giving us some interesting media along the way. A conversational application that delivers multimedia content including conversational text, images, AI-generated images, and statistical graphics within conversations.\n2. Building ML models for improved tagging and organization of data from data collected from efforts in stage 1. While this is possible through human intervention, this step would focus on building a system to create actional insights at scale. This allows us to transform fan and community-curated data at scale and transform it into structured data.\n3. Build out of product, models, and incentive models to narrow focus in creating a scouting network, scouting reports, or gameplay design.\n\nTo reduce any worries about data collection, all data collection will be done anonymously.\n\n### Success metrics **on the 5-week sprint**\n\n- Bi-weekly documentation of buildout\n- Demos for interested members by end of week 2\n- Working beta by end of week 5 on various messaging apps (telegram, discord, WhatsApp) and a custom browser-based platform.\n- Full documentation to ensure no value is lost for future builders\n\nUltimately, a follow-up proposal after this 5 week sprint will allow the community to determine the quality of work and long-term value to the DAO. The next steps will be further outlined in the next proposal as we understand the implications of this sprint.",

Since then our team has made some great progress thanks to the other members as well as myself and I was invited to attend some special meeting to pitch at for ETHDENVER as well:\n\n- Be present in the room with some the great people involved with ETH DENVER\n- Developed more strategy and vision for AIFS with inclusion\n- In 2021 was apart of Gitcoin and have been apart other projects that do quadratic funding mechanism on their new protocol\n- Looking to working closely with Krause House connects with possible being in the room with community partners to support/promote this work.\n\n### **Requested Budget:**\n\n- $1300USDC\n\n### **How will funds be used?**\n\n- Coverage of flights and hotels from LA to Denver. Dates are from Feb 28th- March 6th 2023\n\n### **Team**\n\n- looking to add a support with meeting up with Shanny and add hands on support\n\n### **Project Details**\n\nTravel to ETH Denver will provide the following for AIFS.\n\n- Announcement of our beta grants round in tandem with Gitcoin in announcing their grants protocol as I was invited into the room and have tickets to attend if I am available.\n- Attend ETH Denver and attend grant funding sessions. This will allow me to connect/network with others building in the public goods sector. Be in the room with the other investors and builders that I have been in touch with for over 2years.\n- Bring awareness to AIFS and Krause House’s support of this project by attending events/dinners targeting sponsors. As a member of Spork DAO, ETHDENVER COMMUNITY, DAOdenver communities the ability to network across many channels is vast as well as achievable.\n- **ALSO ADD 2** Launching AIFS at ETH Denver will bring awareness of our beta rounds to a crypto native demographic. While we are building to onboard community partners and projects, this connection and support from the crypto space is essential to raise the initial funds to allow our beta rounds to be successful. The spin off from this is proof of concept will be that we can then show this to larger sponsors that we have been in early conversations with in hopes to onboard them for future rounds.\n\n## **How does this benefit Krause House?**\n\n- AIFS as an arms length organization in the philanthropic space supports the value proposition Krause House pitching to ownership groups around the unique opportunity Krause House presents by being on their cap table by being able to engage and interact with a global audience that is beyond their reach. Specifically being in the room with some the community with people like [(19) KΞV.eth (🤖,💚) (@owocki) / Twitter](https://twitter.com/owocki)\n- Krause House has already been approached by groups doing grassroots work in areas like the Philippines and Guatemala to support local initiatives. I know other people from WOW [(19) World of Women 🎨🎉 (@worldofwomennft) / Twitter](https://twitter.com/worldofwomennft) who are also on the ground in the Philippines I spoke with in the past and be great to reconnect with. AIFS help raise funding and awareness to projects allows KH to capture the media/content side. This connection brings AIFS and KH closer to sponsors, supporters and most importantly - the FANS of Sport.\n\n**### Intention**\n\nTo jump start your level of contribution and participation in IRL events as we will provide a key part to have more participation and help mass adoption into the WEB3 space as well and add to the Krause House community.\n\n #TYMED to add what you feel would be a positive impact to the venue that we will be participating in and SHOW UP and SHOW off the team as well as BALLHOGS as there is expected to be the next season soon with BIG3 teams.",

      "title": "GPT-3 and LLM Product Building Stream",
      "content": "GPT-3 and LLM Product Building Stream\n\nAuthor: peterrr#4718\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\nFunding for stream to build out unique data sets and custom composable products utilizing LLMs such as OpenAI’s GPT-3. Focus will be around Krause House Capital Content, Basketball Analytics.\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\n- 4000 USDC for month of February\n- 5750 USDC / for months ending March and April\n- 3500 $KRAUSE / month\n- Payout end of February, March and April\n\n## Project Details\n\nChatGPT and OpenAI has taken the world by storm. chatGPT has gain faster adoption than any other tech company that has come prior. This stream is to fund the development of products and applications on top of LLMs (large language models) and similar AI models.\n\nWhile this technology rapidly evolves, Krause House must stay at the edge of this frontier to showcase to best showcase our abilities. This proposal is a stream to allow Peter the funding to build products to validate new, novel use case for large language models and how they can benefit Krause House as a whole and how it can benefit our future ownership positions.\n\nThe stream will focus on two areas: \n\n1. Building products and applications (outlined below)\n2. Data collection and organization to ensure we capture unique value long-term to create composable systems\n\n## **Product Builds:**\n\nBelow are a list of product builds in production. As new use cases are presented either organically or sourced from the community, there will be shift in focus to building those applications.\n\n### **Krause House Capital Content Studio:**\n\nEarly demo: [https://khcccontentstudiosearchapp2.peterbergin.repl.co/](https://khcccontentstudiosearchapp2.peterbergin.repl.co/)\n\nAn area to develop knowledge around the venture capital space. A place to build thorough market reports and in-depth deep dives on topics quickly and easily. Build extensive knowledge or quick summaries.\n\nThis idea stems directly from our need for differentiated and unique content strategy. With this build, we use our collective intelligence to curate opinions and information while allow GPT-3 to create fine tuned outputs.\n\nAreas of focus:\n\n- fine tuned model to specific tasks  (market reports, industry deep dives)\n- build visual output built from text data (graphs, knowledge trees, charts etc.)\n    - example: [https://twitter.com/varunshenoy_/status/1620511932930490372?s=12&t=FQDJCtA2czhHXWq2aUWawQ](https://twitter.com/varunshenoy_/status/1620511932930490372?s=12&t=FQDJCtA2czhHXWq2aUWawQ)\n- enable sharing features\n- build a system which credits authors of content (this has been tested and is operational in NBA opinions concept)\n- User options for unique outputs - figma for initial design concept: [https://www.figma.com/file/7sjH5HVdyqdQAt0aalwygZ/Content-Creation-Tool?t=FfNRxZhRvDfyGPPf-1](https://www.figma.com/file/7sjH5HVdyqdQAt0aalwygZ/Content-Creation-Tool?t=FfNRxZhRvDfyGPPf-1)\n\n### **Ball Hog (basketball) Scouting Report:**\n\nA hub where you can quickly and easily build in depth scouting reports on your favorite players. How? Build a database of qualitative information from various data sources to better understand on-court team and player tendencies. Along with quantitative data, we can harness new text based models to better understand your opponents tendencies. Does your favorite player have a tell off the first dribble? We can find out. Eventually the vision would be to build a scout network to collective unique data points. Note: this structure and data collection will allow us to quickly build similar products for all sports.\n\n**This provides us an immediate actionable insight we can use for the ball hogs.**\n\nAreas of focus:\n\n- build fine tuned models from Bayesian Baller’s scouting reports\n- high quality data sourcing such as podcasts, audio interviews, social media and more\n- build user options for unique outputs\n- create visual output built from text data (graphs, knowledge trees, charts etc.)\n\n### **Bayesian Baller Podcast Media Hub:**\n\n**Early demo:** [https://bayesianopinionapp.peterbergin.repl.co/](https://bayesianopinionapp.peterbergin.repl.co/)\n\nThrough audio based content, we can build application which allows you to ask Bayesian Baller a question about basketball, and get receive a factual opinion. This allows new types of content engagement for fans.\n\nAreas of focus:\n\n- building a fine tuned model based on one creator - how can we scale this?\n- create visual output built from text data (graphs, knowledge trees, charts etc.)\n- Build sharing abilities for podcast growth\n\nAdditional Concepts to be explored:\n\n- Global scouting network for sports teams\n- Krause House Contributor Q&A - simple use case which can be implemented rather quickly\n- Deal / deck analysis tool for Krause House Capital\n- Integration with Gameday\n\n### The following outlines the tech behind this proposal:\n\n**Main areas of exploration:**\n\n- Data visualization - taking text (unstructured data) and created structured outputs such as graphs and charts\n- Creative outputs - currently generic models like chatGPT are great at sitting on the fence. Through vector embeddings and fine tuning, we can create more than desirable outputs such as scouting reports\n- Data gathering - this is often the limitation but now with the ability to take in text, it opens up many data sources as highly valuable analytical sources. (forums, podcasts, videos and more) Copyright law is often main barrier.\n\n**How can we manipulate the base model?**\n\nWe have likely all used chatGPT, this is a general purpose application which is not great for specific use cases. But three ways in which we can manipulate it to be beneficial to Krause House: prompt engineering, fine tuning, embedded vectors\n\n- prompt engineering: altering information in prompt to change the output. This is the lowest friction. While it is crucial, Krause House’s main competitive advantage will come in the following two strategies\n- Fine Tuning - fine tuning is used to teach GPT-3 a new task, not new information. For example, we can teach GPT-3 to create desirable scouting reports based on our inputs and outputs. Allowing it to become our own personal scouting report writer.\n- Embedded vectors - this is where magic happens. Embedded vectors allow us to teach GPT-3 new information, make that information searchable by meaning (not text=text search, it allow text=meaning search), and subsequently pull this information for our own specific use cases\n\n### **Deliverables**\n\n- New or updated demo every two weeks showcase new build(s)\n- Shipping live production at least once every two weeks to get products in the hands of consumers\n    - crucial as this space is moving fast and we should signal our intent\n- Written long form content publishable by Krause House or Krause House Capital outlining progress and takeaways every two weeks\n    - we need to signal to the world that we are building on the edges\n- Weekly “office hours” for people to ask product questions/brainstorm and more if desired - allowing for a community impacted build\n\nEnding note:\n\n- No one or very few are exploring how LLMs are applicable in sports. By proposing this stream, I propose we lead the evolution of these applications in sports.\n- Peter will continue assisting DIO and other projects where needed",

      "title": "Heat Check x NBA Web3’s Team Budget",
      "content": "**Author:** Denny, kevtae\n\n## Voting Options\n\nThe option to choose between funding structures for 1, 2, or 3 months for Denny & kevtae has been made available to voters, providing flexibility for both the team and voters.\n\nNOTE: We believe by securing funding for 3 months, we can maximize our chances of successfully delivering a fan engagement product that is licensed by the NBA.\n\n## Context\n\nWe are currently working with the NBA’s Web3 advisory group. They have previously subcontracted & executed the [NBA’s Association NFT](https://theassociationnft.com/) launch as contractors & have since maintained relationships with the NBA as their Web3 advisory group. Currently, they have full flexibility in managing the NBA’s community on Discord.\n\n## **ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add**\n\nWe’re *presented with the opportunity to demonstrate the viability of the Heat Check concept within the official NBA Discord community. Once the deliverables are a success, Heat Check will have the opportunity to co-pitch this to the NBA directly. Heat Check will use these results as a catapult to raise outside funding.*\n\nThe Heat Check team’s proposal ended Dec 2022. Over the last month, **Denny** & **kevtae** have continued working on Heat Check without a stream and have made significant progress with Mario.\n\nDuring this month, Heat Check has\n\n- Onboarded YNG Dreamerz from OTE\n- Has partnered with the NBA’s Web3 team (The Association NFT, NBA Discord 40k+ users) and partnered with In The Lab’s Discord community (7k+ users) to focus on launching a Heat Check Discord bot for each of these servers\n\n## **The Opportunities**\n\nHeat Check is aiming to bring value to the biggest basketball league in the world, the NBA, and here's how we're going to do it…\n\nThe NBA Web3 Team is open to the following:\n\n1. Using the Heat Check Discord Bot for user-generated content & engagement in the NBA’s Official Discord (40k+)\n2. Co-pitch Heat Check to NBA\n\nThe NBA has struggled with effectively engaging its fans online, whether it’s through the NBA App or their Discord server. By developing a fan engagement discord bot directly in the NBA's official discord server, we aim to tackle the issue of fan engagement head-on. We are stoked to offer a solution that not only addresses this problem, but also provides an enjoyable and interactive experience for the fans. \n\nBy going through with this initiative, we would also be able to integrate the Heat Check bot into the following communities:\n\n- In The Lab\n- Overtime YNG Dreamerz\n\n## **Requested Budget:**\n\nDenny - 3 month x 7K USDC & 3K KRAUSE\n\n0x026Fa2cdC914274242c0b891E33232274b23c992\n\nKevtae - 3 month x 7K USDC & 3K KRAUSE\n\n0x95ADD9Dc65d6e26DB140da8771e17571795f76A4\n\nFunds will be sent starting on Feb 1st\n\nSome added Team context: Currently Mario Lopes, a full-time contributor for KH, is handling BD for Heat Check & is the only funded contributor at 9,167 $USDC & 7,500 $KRAUSE. Smit has joined the team as a Marketing / BD intern at 500 USDC/month & 15-20 hours/week. By adding Denny & Kevtae, we would now have 4 team members on Heat Check.\n\n## **How will funds be used?**\n\nDuring January, the original goal of Heat Check was to raise funding, but instead, we focused a lot of our efforts on BD partnerships, and eventually connected with the NBA’s Web3 Team.\n\nFunds will be used to have **Denny** & **kevtae** on full-time contributor streams, to ensure that the development deliveries are completed with the NBA, In The Lab, and Overtime.\n\n## **Project Details**\n\n**February - (Discord Bot)**\n\n- A Fan Engagement Tool for the NBA’s community\n- Development of Heat Check Discord Bot - The bot will be a more honed-in version of the current Heat Check App, that focuses on daily challenge submissions\n    1. Every 24 hours at the same time, a challenge will appear\n        - Every user has one single submission chance\n        - Challenges will be quick & frictionless to record (discord file limit)\n        - Example challenges: Go and make a layup, 3-pointer, full-court shot, make a shot into a garbage can 6 feet away, take a photo of yourself watching an NBA game, etc.\n    2. After verification by admins, the bot will notify accepted/rejected challenges & user earns XP, leveling up their Discord user\n\n**March (Iterating and Pitching)**\n\n- Develop a challenge feed where users can see each other’s submissions (take advantage of the newly onboarded 1000s of users)\n    - Challenge feeds would be moderated by Heat Check and NBA Web3 team\n- Testing and Iterating on Discord Bot with NBA, In The Lab, and Overtime\n- Minimise non-challenges features in the Heat Check Web App (cut down on feature pollution)\n- Pitch Heat Check to NBA and potentially close out on a deal with them\n\n**April** - **(Heat Check Services and Launch Day)**\n\n- Prep for the launch of NBA X Association NFT drop in April\n- Prep for the launch of NBN23’s engagement solution in June 2023\n- Provide and build out further Heat Check’s API services to NBN. This will entail:\n    - Challenges (submission, creation, verification, rewards)\n    - NFT Avatar Creation Toolkit (assets, avatar customization)",

The additional compensation package will require Soothsquad submitting an additional proposal that is commensurate with reasonable standard rates for a \"finders fee.”\n\nAll compensation payouts can be issued to ETH address: \n\n0xCA8F2f8273D090335DDFe95Ae397D4D04eaa3dC7\n\n*For additional context and details about proposal events see the related thread located in the governance channel on Discord.",

      "content": "Author: dbag#3251\n\nRecipient Address: **0xE97F19e5DF4e6dCa116c3097CE16a3bfFE891Cee**\n\n# **Summary**\n\nThis is a redrafted proposal to the one that went through snapshot from 1/20-1/23 - found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x871f3f4cffad9ddc5bd711c8e96905cc3979f7c11482e2c5efcc114e00e1fb5f). \n\nKrause House has accomplished a lot this past year but not enough of the basketball community knows or has heard about us. I’ve experienced this blocker in trying to raise sponsorships funds for events such as Krause Houe JAM @ [NFT NYC](https://youtu.be/i1Qy6WhAfmQ) / [Art Basel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Clw8cDZjSTr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) and in closing partnerships for Krause House. I believe we need to clarify/refine our narrative on socials like IG & TikTok and capture more stories on our journey to grow our following so our accomplishments go noticed. Having curated and executed on some of the key stories in Krause House’s journey, I feel most equiped to bring KH more visibilty. To do this I’m looking be on a monthly stream of 6000 USDC for two months to see if my methods can produce real results.\n\n# **The Role**\n\n**Marketing & business development** \n\n**Content Creation & Upkeep**\nI will manage end-to-end creation of content which includes ideating, producing, editing, cross-promoting, copywriting and uploading to our social platforms. The content I will focus on producing will be around explaining our core mission in a digestable way. The goal is to capture the attention of a wider basketball audience.\n\nHere’s an example of when I was on Sway Calloway, sharing Krause House’s Mission:\n\n- [Link to the Sway interview on Youtube (Starts 50 Minutes)](https://youtu.be/5Y4Yy9iw84M)\n\nHere’s some other content I was the direct lead on:\n\n- [Krause House JAM @ NFT NYC](https://youtu.be/i1Qy6WhAfmQ)\n- [Tech Runs Basel Event](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Clw8cDZjSTr/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)\n\n**Assist in BD Relations** \n\nI will continue to form relationships for KH that will bring collaborative opportunities in content creation (podcasts, videos, etc) , events, court refurbs concepts, and sponsorships. My plan is to leverage our partner networks created since NFT NYC, inbound opprtunities through our social platforms and targeted cold outreach.  \n\nHere’s some examples of relationships formed since NFT NYC:\n\n- In The Lab\n- Tech Runs\n- Terance Mann\n- Swish House\n- Mike Swift\n\n \n\n**Court Refurbs**\n\nI will work with Shanny from AIFS to help close partnerships and also spread the AIFS’s court refurb initiative across socials by creating storytelling content.  \n\nHere’s an example of what that may look like:\n\n- [KH x Philippines Doc Trailer](https://youtu.be/R5406F8cLPQ)\n\nIRL Experiences \n\nI will source, scope and find funding for future Krause House events. This will involve discussing with all available partners and finding windows of time in the year to activate, developing a clear vision and pitching it to groups that have available funds and align with the vision. A big factor in landing sponsorships for events has to do with how much reach we have. Growing our reach will favor landing sponsors and being able to commit to events.\n\n# **Proposal**\n\n- A two month budget of 6000 USDC paid monthly.\n- Wallet Address: 0xE97F19e5DF4e6dCa116c3097CE16a3bfFE891Cee\n- Funds to be sent starting on Feb 1st  and at the start of each month.\n\n**Protections:**\n\n- Stewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.\n- Community may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.\n\n# Intention\n\nOur lack of visibility to the basketball world seems to be the biggest vulnerability in pitching to Front Offices. Our social presence also being top of the funnel for all our projects and opportunities it could use a singular member focus. My goal is to start with implementing a more consistent marketing strategy so we can grow our online presence. Here a few starting goals that i’ll have my eyes set on.\n\nGoals: \n\n- Gain 5k IG & TikTok followers.\n- Gain 2 more partners that is either content, sponsorship or court refurb related.\n\n# Why DBAG\n\nI bring a skillset of taste-making, execution & raising.

      "content": "**Bayesian Baller Contributor Stream Renewal**\n\n**Author:** Bayesian Baller\n\n**Wallet:** 0xD9b3Ad0eb0d3b9DF83CE919198F9ad0Ff692522F\n\n**TL;DR - Contributor Value-Add**\n\nFor the past year, Bayesian Baller has contributed on a variety of fronts - including media, podcasting, product, and analytics. He is the Host & Producer of Around The Association, Krause House’s go-to podcast for all things basketball, which is now in Season 2. Additionally, he leads all of Krause House’s basketball analytics and data science initiatives, including work for the Ball Hogs and prospective NBA partners.\n\nThis is Bayesian’s fourth contributor stream and will allow him to continue creating original content for the community and providing analytical value for Krause House’s clients.\n\nBelow are links to Bayesian’s previous contributor streams:\n\n- [Fall ‘22 Contributor Stream](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x1c017342c3b85806c5e00cb567ea8acb61d819b3f3d90f48c2a50163a29026d9)\n- [Summer ‘22 Contributor Stream](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x2bba3a08c7f82014e8f20b8d6b368ccc1cc2bb1c53717073179e1bde71d3a99f)\n- [Spring ‘22 Contributor Stream](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x75ec4cb3175857f6b967f8ccce0132c618ee702d02017e755bc81c5080b6fa7c)\n\n**Funding Request**\n\nUp to:\n\n- 3k $KRAUSE / month\n- 3k $USDC / month\n\nPaid monthly for 4 months (January - April 2023).\n\nStewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.\n\nCommunity may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.\n\n**What will Bayesian Baller ship during Spring ‘23?**\n\n**Around The Association**\n\n- Bayesian has a variety of exciting guests lined up over the next several months - including current players, former NBA execs, basketball social influencers, and successful sports tech entrepreneurs. Additionally, Bayesian will continue working alongside the Watch Gameday team to produce high-quality, fan-driven content that’s voted on by the Krause House community and shared across social media to continue building our following.\n\n**KH NBA Analytics Portfolio**\n\n- Bayesian will continue working alongside Greg and the engineering team on additional basketball analytics research projects. The plan is to build up an analytics portfolio that the Krause House executive team can use in pitches with prospective NBA partners to showcase the community’s basketball acumen and technical skill set. He plans on having the community vote on topics and then conduct research on the topic of choice.\n\n**Overtime Elite x BIG3 Analytics**\n\n- Similar to his work with the Ball Hogs last summer, Bayesian has plans for how Krause House can contribute to the YNG Dreamerz in a data analytics and basketball strategy capacity. There is a massive opportunity to show Overtime that Krause House can provide value beyond community engagement and actually impact the play on the court. The YNG Dreamerz could be the only team in OTE with an “analytics and scouting department”.\n\n**TBT Basketball Tournament Exploration**\n\n- Bayesian would like to explore opportunities for Krause House to create a team and enter the 2023 TBT Tournament. By hosting the podcast, Bayesian has been able to maintain relationships with a variety of current professional and former college players that could realistically form a competitive team. The TBT generates enormous media coverage - with some games broadcast on ESPN - and could be incredible exposure for Krause House.\n\n**What did Bayesian Baller ship during Fall ‘22?**\n\n**1) Media & Original Content**\n\nBayesian released six brand new episodes of [Around The Association](https://open.spotify.com/show/3YadlLpwrMTOG0ecvX65bw), including two in-person video episodes!\n\n- [S2, E5 • Golden State’s Ja-Dropping Christmas, Paolo Banchero’s Historic Rookie Season, & The Playoff Bound New York Knicks](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1OtOZwLIYIOMmXrQpl6dKU?si=39YZwPy4RgePy0jsVrlOaQ)\n- [S2, E4 • The NBA’s Next Big Rivalry, Book’s Bonkers Night, & Jaylen’s Miraculous Midrange](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KOgt0wmkM6eF4QjY6J5IP?si=XBmCd9gHTsSsAOjV50oGug)\n- [S2, E3 • Welcome to Around The Association: Gameday Edition!](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4InAChSJyE8Xnrokl3iAnO?si=Ncu929WYT6uxVt1gaRXN8g)\n- [S2, E2 • Early NBA Storylines, Vegas Over-Unders, Awards Predictions, & “Who He Play For?”](https://open.spotify.com/episode/0m6rm2Axvn98Il5LXz4hR3?si=bp1za_4lSBa_DZ1omil12Q)\n- [S2, E1 • Startup Life, Hoops Dreams, & the UCLA Days with Mustafa Abdul-Hamid](https://youtu.be/C6RKcHJYXFs)\n- [S1, E20 • 1-on-1 with Kareem Maddox, 5x Gold Medalist & FIBA 3x3 World Champion](https://youtu.be/oVr3NJ7T41A)\n\nHere’s what some fellow Jerry’s had to say about his work…\n\n- [@thycommodore](https://twitter.com/thycommodore/status/1586056111572094976?s=20&t=GtCr523v027O1irs4qjBWQ)\n- [@gregfromstl](https://twitter.com/gregfromstl/status/1586086231456112640?s=20&t=GtCr523v027O1irs4qjBWQ)\n- [@jdcrabtreeiii](https://twitter.com/jdcrabtreeiii/status/1611344408649289732?s=20&t=GtCr523v027O1irs4qjBWQ)\n\nBayesian also formed an exciting new partnership with the Watch Gameday crew (shoutout to Greg and Crabtree for their incredible work), where he…\n\n- [Co-Hosted Live Hangouts & NBA Watch Parties](https://twitter.com/WatchGameday/status/1603092953140002816?s=20&t=UFRww_LUBTi_M3KFxsln3A)\n- [Collaborated on New Fan-Driven Media Products](https://www.gameday.watch/creator/3)\n- [Provided Original Content for Social Media Initiatives](https://www.tiktok.com/@watchgameday)\n\n**2) Data Analytics & Basketball Strategy**\n\nWith the assistance of Greg and the KH Engineering Team, Bayesian researched and published our first ever Krause House NBA analytics project that has already been used in pitches with prospective NBA teams!\n\nSpecifically, they collected the data by tapping into a public-facing version of the official NBA Stats API. Greg used a Python script to parse through the official play-by-play and generate a database of all 30 teams that could be used in SQL, while Bayesian used a variety of custom crafted queries in PostGreSQL to create a comprehensive analytics dashboard related to NBA league-wide and team specific second chance scoring opportunities.\n\nBayesian then provided final analysis and product vision, while Greg handled the website programming and design. The result is an NBA Front Office-caliber analytics dashboard equipped with unique statistical insights and interactive data visualizations that can be presented to prospective NBA teams:\n\n[Offensive Putbacks, Why Bother? The Art of Exploiting the Extra Possession](https://analytics-presentation-git-nba-version-gregfromstl.vercel.app/)\n\n**3) Vibes & Relationships**\n\nBayesian has also been leading the charge to get Krause House’s Stacy Davis selected to the NBA G League All-Star Game next month in Salt Lake City. This effort involves rallying the community on social media, as well as, pursuing some other very promising alternatives to generate votes for Stacy.\n\nStacy was a fan favorite player for the Ball Hogs last summer and has participated in various podcasts and live streams for the Krause House community. This is a huge opportunity for Krause House to show the NBA and G-League the power of our community and the positive influence that DAO’s can have on fan-player relations!\n\n[Stacy Davis, NBA G League All-Star Game Social Campaign](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1615388006797434880?s=20&t=UFRww_LUBTi_M3KFxsln3A)\n\n**What has Bayesian Baller shipped to date?**\n\n**1) Media & Original Content**\n\nSince January 2022, Bayesian has been the Host & Executive Producer of [Around The Association](https://open.spotify.com/show/3YadlLpwrMTOG0ecvX65bw), the official basketball podcast of Krause House DAO & the first podcast launched by a non-steward under the community's burgeoning media network.\n\nFrom day one his intent in launching Around The Association has been to drive community engagement, demonstrate Krause House's basketball acumen, as well as, to break down the barrier to entry into Web3 and get everyday hoops fans interested in DAOs.\n\nIn the show's first year of existence, Bayesian released 25 episodes and played host to an impressive list of guests - including current and former NBA players, coaches, front office members, and national media. All of whom Bayesian educated on the mission of Krause House.\n\nHere are a few of Around The Association’s most accomplished guests from Year 1…\n\n- [Kelan Martin, Indiana Pacers Player](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7dMKyrsrilqzqdlm0fmM12?si=BDthzKp8TIaxQYtzkI-Tnw)\n- [Stacy Davis, SLC Stars & Ball Hogs Player](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3B07KdwMlqroNUiK0JOhUT?si=XmhH5VxjRMmQyhMyDbLM_w)\n- [Phil Weber, Former Phoenix Suns Coach](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4nwgu6H2Mq3FobcrLos1w8?si=9tunxhYhTBWLnnhM2PCCQw)\n- [Jeremy Woo, Sports Illustrated NBA Writer](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4ZnWXltiNrYPQlgR69DdKS?si=GIWc76pLQdKMYk2iq5Z4wQ)\n- [Kareem Maddox, 5x FIBA 3x3 Gold Medalist](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6JfioOZwGHhu6j0jh99nfE?si=nfU5dML0T6u14-3ndFF1iA)\n- [Rob Basha, Former NBA Analytics Staffer](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2UBbmWco06hibfvSPvX1uM?si=E6VvG5ZFQSOYqRJj94kx2A)\n- [Mustafa Abdul-Hamid, Sports Tech Entrepreneur](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1Ke6VfLeg1ne2cPk63Sw4x?si=Hlc4Xtr1T6uCDbAFv6iaQA)\n\n**2) Data Analytics & Basketball Strategy**\n\nIn Summer 2022, Krause House DAO purchased the Ball Hogs in Ice Cube's BIG3 League becoming the first decentralized autonomous organization to own and operate a professional basketball team.\n\nDuring our inaugural season owning the Ball Hogs, Bayesian led all data analytics and basketball strategy initiatives for the team. He collaborated directly with Head Coach Rick Barry and the players using advanced stats and video analysis techniques to craft custom scouting reports that the team used during games and practices.\n\nSome of these data-driven scouting reports - which featured unique research around shot quality, lineup analysis, and in-game strategy - were also publicly promoted by the BIG3 on Twitter to their more than 140k followers while others were circulated within the Krause House community as exclusive content for token-holders.\n\nIn addition to spearheading the Ball Hogs' analytics initiatives, Bayesian also worked closely alongside the Krause House executive and engineering teams on custom projects for prospective NBA ownership groups showcasing the DAO's basketball expertise and how the community would contribute to the teams' analytics departments.\n\nHere are some of the scouting reports and analytics projects Bayesian created for the Ball Hogs…\n\n- [Week 6 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. 3's Company](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-u9UkBi6Ff8Jv5MUnPZMSI6FnCNftpwG/view?usp=share_link)\n- [Week 5 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Aliens](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GVBbOwzUZbk0fWGhnIJ5LuQ95x5vcNaZ/view?usp=share_link)\n- [Week 4 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Tri-State](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KT7K4z_Ld5_fNN7wiFHdKGj9jRRuCHX4/view?usp=share_link)\n- [Week 3 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Triplets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rqnl7j9ybWFre9cpsK2nxl7uVRa6ohVU/view?usp=share_link)\n- [Week 2 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Ghost Ballers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FrvImaWGpwA7-Vwc22pMfYryWBa3doMq/view?usp=share_link)\n- [Week 1 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Killer 3's](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10r3Fh3zGn6BwM2gn9c4SK7Q_HyxCoPac/view?usp=share_link)\n\n**Bayesian Baller’s Background & Professional Qualifications**\n\nBayesian has worked professionally in the sports industry for 5+ years, including the last 3 years as a Data Scientist / Product Manager for a leader in the basketball analytics space and the previous 2 years at the collegiate level with two major Div. 1 college basketball programs. \n\nAlong the way, he has developed working relationships with a variety of influential figures in the basketball industry, who he will continue to lean upon to help facilitate partnerships and opportunities for Krause House to reach their ultimate goal of NBA ownership.",

      "title": "Provide Funding for a 50pt NBA Game Bounty",
      "content": "Provide Funding for a 50pt NBA Game Bounty Budget\n\nAuthor: Kenny (acidicsantana)\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\nKrause Hause seeds $1000 into a [Juicebox.money](http://Juicebox.money) project with the stipulation that the funds of the project are a bounty that can be claimed by the next NBA player to drop a 50pt game. We then market the bounty as a fun experiment in decentralized fandom anyone can take part in.\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\n$1000 in ETH (exact ETH amount to be determined based on USD/ETH conversion rate at time of Juicebox project creation)\n\n### How will funds be used?\n\nFunds will be used to start the [Juicebox.money](http://Juicebox.money) fundraising project that will represent the bounty. If the bounty fails and no NBA player claims it, the money will be returned to the treasury (minus gas fees).\n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\nSince Juicebox projects need to be created and controlled by a singular entity, I would suggest that the most senior member of Krause House be responsible for handling funds and managing the project. I do not know who this would be and would appreciate recommendations on the best possible person to manage the funds. \n\n### Team\n\nThis would be a Krause House community effort\n\n### Project Details\n\nI propose that Krause House should organize a fan bounty for the next NBA player to drop 50pts in a game. \n\nThis would be done by starting a Juicebox.money smart contract fundraiser that anyone can contribute to, with the stipulation that the money raised will be claimable by the next NBA player that has a 50pt game. To avoid legal issues around directly paying a player, we will make it clear that these funds are for a charity of the NBA player’s choice.\n\nThe funds would be available to be claimed by any NBA player that hits 50pts after the fund goes live. So, in the case that a player hits 50pts a week after the fund goes live but does not claim, the fund would be claimable by a player hitting 50pts the next day. Furthermore, there would be no limit on claim time. A player could claim a month after they dropped 50pts if the bounty is still available at that time (even if other players have also had 50pts in the meantime). \n\nThe only requirements for the NBA player to claim will be that they hit 50 points after the go-live date of the fundraiser, that they identify the charity the money will go to, AND that they submit an NFT commemorating the achievement to the Krause House team managing the funds. That NFT would then be randomly raffled off to one contributor to the bounty fund as a way of incentivizing donations.\n\nWe could publicize the project as Krause House exploring new ways that fans can interact with players that were never possible before web3. The best case scenario is that the project catches on amongst the general audience of crypto sports fans and we can rally the fund to the point where the donations are attractive enough for NBA players to claim the bounty. This would undoubtedly drive huge amounts of press interest and visibility for Krause House.\n\nWorst case scenario is that the project never receives attention and the funds go back into the Krause House treasury at the end of the 2023 playoffs. It would be a waste of time, but with little waste of money.\n\nThe primary responsibilities for Krause House would be:\n\n- $1000 seed fund provided by Krause House to jump-start the fund\n- Krause House team to create and manage the Juicebox DAO smart contract for fundraising\n- Krause House to help with promotional efforts to spread awareness of the bounty\n- Krause House to run the process of raffling off the player NFT to a randomly selected bounty contributor (should the bounty be claimed)\n\n**Legal notes:**\nShould this proposal be passed, it will need a legal / risk loop overview to ensure that there will be no legal repercussions for Krause House in managing / contributing to a charity payment based on NBA player in-game performance.\n\nFor background, here’s my initial message regarding this idea: https://discord.com/channels/847908414981275648/847908415472140339/1055252402883792896\n\nI’ve also written up a sample of what I would imagine the content on the Juicebox project page would read. This can be found here:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rIGeP4o2iXaajZuPf3eWqo1upO_rc_A4rGKbqhdYctk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rIGeP4o2iXaajZuPf3eWqo1upO_rc_A4rGKbqhdYctk/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me directly on Discord @ **acidicsantana#5249**",

Setting up a relationship to bring with us to future events like ETHDENVER.\n\n### Background\n\nQuantum Miami is the birthplace for coins like ETH and for us to build by reconnecting with the friends we establish within the community of “Tech Runs Miami” we had during ART Basel it would be great to host something with other like-minded group at this event that would help launch us into Allstar week with our interacting heat check game that would help direct traffic into the discord as well as to our other programs we have designed ready to present to the public! Krause House as we build this will help present us in a room of defi and again to the Miami community who maybe missed us the first time! As well as a media coverage that would be in attendance and promote us as a group that is working establishing the bond needed with community providing the ability to for other to learn.\n\n## The why to this that makes it MATTER:\n\n1st is to **Attend** the Miami event in person Jan **24th** at TRYNCO summit  \n\n2nd **NBA just before the Allstar Game** we should be in MIAMI where we will see a Community that is more accepting to crypto and is knowledgeable. Just only one the most important thing to have and we have the opportunity to establish ourselves as the foundation of web3 collaborations providing the use cases needed to solidify the ecosystem through good projects increasing public uses for tech in life building bridges real life! It takes more than one event and we have 2 as well as it take more than one community to come together for us all to make the impact on the world we like to see in the future. With the media there providing us recognition to be visible working with communities. Connecting the dots that make the world a better place with teamwork and teaching fundamental lessons in tech with digital assets will become a huge leverage to show the NBA that we are on the right path with growth as well as inclusivity with this event providing access to the community of Miami and throughout the crypto community.      \n\nT *For us to be able to participate in the one of DeFi’s most established protocol events happening at this Flagship event happening is needed that we represent unity with the goals to provide the tools needed for a healthy mind body of life we are going to this event we will have that chance as it will be documented as well as filmed.*\n\nWith the partnership with this event as well as the connections made I see this as a win to be apart  as well that will be having conversations about the future project as well. \n\n**Community** is everything and **crosspollination** is defiantly a blessing to have as we keep growing !\n\nRemember to build up the momentum about “All in for sports” if in the room this would be a possible discussion if we wanted. Krause House DAO is needed to be in the room and in the conversation to be considered. Providing this additional runway inside look to what we are looking to providing as a more robust group who look at our future for DAO and its operations as we work towards our ultimate goal of acquiring an ownership stake in an NBA Team.\n\n## What's needed to be DONE:\n\nBe on the ground days before the event after all-star voting is finished to talk with the community as well as discuss the NBA [ALL-STAR VOTING](https://www.nba.com/allstar/2023?cid=nba%3Anews%3Aown%3Asocial%3Atw%3Atwfeed%3Aallstar%3Acont%3Aconvis%3At-cont%3Au-glo%3Au-en%3A&_branch_match_id=1001696375384177473&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXTywo0MvJzMvWy0tK1EvOz9VPzMkpLkksKssvycxLNzIGAAlJhF8oAAAA) will end on Jan 21, 2023. Provide the community with tickets to attend this event with KH and inform them about the KD DAO. On one hand we have a community of Basketball focused group and on another side we have philanthropic possibility as well as entertainment to provide some comfort for mental wealth with a co-hosted event IRL would be possible.

Since then our team has made some great progress:\n\n- Formed a governance and sponsorships/partnerships cell\n- Developed a strategy and vision for AIFS\n- Partnered with Gitcoin to build our quadratic funding mechanism on their new protocol\n- Working closely with Krause House connects such as In The Lab to bring in community partners to support/promote this work.\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\n- $2000USDC\n\n### How will funds be used?\n\n- Coverage of flights and hotels from Calgary to Denver. Dates are from March 1-5 2023\n\n### Team\n\n- Shanny\n\n### Project Details\n\nTravel to ETH Denver will provide the following for AIFS.\n\n- Announcement of our beta grants round in tandem with Gitcoin in announcing their grants protocol.\n- Attend ETH Denver (ticket already sponsored $500 value) and attend day sessions. This will allow me to connect/network with others building in the public goods sector.\n- Bring awareness to AIFS and Krause House’s support of this project by attending events/dinners targeting sponsors. As a member of Boys Club, SheFi, Arkive, FWB and Chainforest communities the ability to network across many channels is vast.\n- Launching AIFS at ETH Denver will bring awareness of our beta rounds to a crypto native demographic. While we are building to onboard community partners and projects, this connection and support from the crypto space is essential to raise the initial funds to allow our beta rounds to be successful. The spin off from this is proof of concept will be that we can then show this to larger sponsors that we have been in early conversations with in hopes to onboard them for future rounds.\n\n## How does this benefit Krause House?\n\n- AIFS as an arms length organization in the philanthropic space supports the value proposition Krause House pitching to ownership groups around the unique opportunity Krause House presents by being on their cap table by being able to engage and interact with a global audience that is beyond their reach.\n- Krause House has already been approached by groups doing grassroots work in areas like the Philippines and Guatemala to support local initiatives. While not in KH’s mandate, having AIFS help raise funding and awareness to projects allows KH to capture the media/content side. This connection brings AIFS and KH closer to sponsors, supporters and most importantly - the FANS of Sport.",

      "content": "Philippines Native NBA Content Experiment (TikTok) Budget\n\nAuthor: Commodore\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\nCreate a $2k USDC budget to run a Philippines NBA content experiment of 10-20 videos in Filipino. The goal is to demonstrate the appetite of Filipino market for NBA content to establish CPMs for this type of media. This is valuable because we can leverage the audience we build to test our international fan value proposition. \n\n### Requested Budget:\n\n$2k USDC to be allocated via Utopia to a Filipino contractor. \n\n### How will funds be used?\n\nTikTok best practices suggest to have a fresh iPhone with a fresh iCloud account posting exclusively from within the geographic region that’s being targeted (location GPS + IP). Therefore, we’ll need to purchase an iPhone 8 ($300 USD). \n\nAdditionally, the creator will charge approximately $50/video to publish and manage the comments. \n\nThe funds will be used to purchase the hardware (iPhone) & to compensate the creator on a per video basis. \n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\nVia Utopia. The creator doesn’t have a crypto wallet & has requested fiat. The current plan is for Commodore to pay the creator via a TradFi solution & request reimbursement (with payment confirmation) via Utopia. \n\n### Team\n\n- Commodore\n- Would love to collab with someone on this who passes an interview process who’s passionate for high quality media creation\n    - This person could earn $KRAUSE through our Coordinape Give Circle\n\n### Project Details\n\nCreator: IG @unnecessaryfiles\n\nBasketball Portfolio: TikTok @nba.allday24\n\nTop 3 videos: 4.9m, 2.0m, 1.5m views\n\n**Success Narrative**\n\nMarch, 12th 2023 — Our fast growing TikTok account is up to 50,000 followers in two short months with our top 3 videos generating 1.5m, 1.1m, & 850k views. We’re beginning to skew the content towards particular teams to start trying to build team affinity with our users. This upcoming Ball Hogs season, we’ll be dropping Ball Hogs highlights to this account to drive awareness for our team. We’re planning on doing another local basketball tournament and seeing what type of traffic we drive to the event via our TikTok account.\n\nIn our conversations with ownership groups, they’re interested in how we can convert these fans to becoming fans of their particular team. Additionally, there is excitement about exploring “lite” monetization — one idea is a fan club model but optimized towards Filipino content.\n\nGiven the success of this project, we’re preparing to pitch this to OTE & BIG3 to deploy in both the Philippines & Brazil (two fast growing basketball markets).",

He’s been consistently answering questions & making translations as needed. \n\n**### Specification**\n\nThis contributor may submit a request for *up to* the specified amount based on self-assessment of their work.\n\n**### Intention**\n\nThis is intended to encourage contributors to take immediate action on a wide range of problems/opportunities, as opposed to proceeding through the slower process of submitting a proposal for a narrow scope of work.\n\nWe prefer to invest in and groom talent, giving *them* the freedom and capital they need to be entrepreneurs within our community.  We value self-starters who are able to take action and deliver quality work.\n\n**### bUt SomEb0dY m1gHt t@kE t0o mUçh** Both the community and the Stewardship team has the power to cancel this stream if it is being abused.  In addition, if a contributor abuses this trust, they are effectively burning their social credibility and ability to successfully submit proposals in the future.  We expect some lossiness; however, we believe the benefits of getting good work off the ground is worth this small cost.",

The signers of the Gnosis Safe would be Jcauley#6282, commodore#0145, & gandaolf#3917. All expenses and payout requests would be processed via Utopia for record keeping. \n\n**Authors:**  Jcauley#6282, gandaolf#3917\n\n1. **TYMED** will submit receipts for each transaction\n2. Any funds not used will be returned to the DAO\n\n### Funding Breakdown :\n\nall this is subject to corrections as we plan on the event with people intalks now such as **gandaolf#3917**\n\n- Travel: 15% if needed for allowance for KH member attendance tickets are $495 each and as we will be partnering up, we would make it possible to be able 2 providing all KH members who wanted to attend entrance to the event!\n- Accommodations %15 ex. rooms\n- Supplies: 8% basketball and tables\n- Engagement : 40%\n- Teaming up with other communities to have a great after party and continue relationship building (special event afterparty & media): 15%\n- **TYMED** for all the extra content provided 5%\n\n## **GOAL OF PROJECT:**\n\nIs to put on a event a day before the Miami event happening in January or the last weekend of January the 24th co host a event and then the quantum Miami event will happening in Miami on the 25-27th just before the ALLSTAR GAME!!  \n\n### Background\n\nQuantum Miami is the birthplace for coins like ETH and build reconnecting with the friends we establish within the community of “Tech Runs Miami” we had during ART Basel it would be great to host with other like minded group a event that would help launch us into Allstar week with our Playable interacting heat check game that we have a QR code set up on display at the event to help direct traffic into the discord as well as to our other programs we have designed ready to present to the public! I will have the opportunity to have a unique ability to be apart the branding on the sponsorship package and would do some merch related to Krause House as well as help present us in a room of defi and again to the Miami community who maybe missed us the first time!  \n\n## The why to this that makes it MATTER:\n\nNBA just before the Allstar Game we will be in MIAMI where you will see the #Community more accepting to crypto and knowledgeable is the just only one the most important thing to have and we have the opportunity to establish ourselves as the foundation of web3 collaborations providing the use cases needed to solidify the ecosystem through good projects increasing public uses for tech in life building bridges real life! It takes more than one event as well as it take more than one community to come together for us all to make the impact on the world we like to see in the future. We are looking to have this worked out with all the necessary agreements established by the end of the year! Partnerships with the above as well as a E-commerce for merch to be available for the event in collaboration with TYME INC. clothing making merch with print on demand abilities starting out to be distributed as determined by the KH DAO in the future. Connecting the dots that make the world a better place with teamwork and teaching fundamental lessons in tech with digital assets will become a huge leverage to show the NBA that we are on the right path with growth as well as inclusivity.      \n\nThe *Krause House DAO will be able to be apart the event to be present and have our merch on display with a group who would all be able to attend to inform the audience and community about the event at the DeFi lead event in Miami. For us to be able to participate in the governance for one of DeFi’s most established protocol events happening at this Flagship event happening its needed that we represent unity with the goals to provide the tools needed for a healthy mind body in the future of life through this event we will have that chance as it will be documented as well as filmed buy the event we have speakers at then afterwards with Special guest to invite SpottieWifi waring to weare some the merch TYME INC. Krouse House merch that is designed for this event.* \n\nWith the partnership with this event as well as the connections made I see this as a win to be apart another charitable event as well that will be the project helping support the people working who have been displaced in Florida. \n\nCommunity is everything and crosspollination is defiantly a blessing to have as we keep growing !\n\nAll this will Yield a percentage to be generated that would be added to a few nonprofit organizations such as our own “all in for sports” as well as to the Krause House DAO Treasury. Providing additional funds to increase our runway - providing a more robust future for DAO Operations as we work towards our ultimate goal of acquiring an ownership stake in an NBA Team.\n\n## What's needed to be DONE:\n\nNBA [ALL-STAR VOTING](https://www.nba.com/allstar/2023?cid=nba%3Anews%3Aown%3Asocial%3Atw%3Atwfeed%3Aallstar%3Acont%3Aconvis%3At-cont%3Au-glo%3Au-en%3A&_branch_match_id=1001696375384177473&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXTywo0MvJzMvWy0tK1EvOz9VPzMkpLkksKssvycxLNzIGAAlJhF8oAAAA) will end on Jan 21, 2023. So maybe that Sunday possibility are to produce something then or the 24th. On one hand we have a community of Basketball focused group and on another side we have philanthropic as well as entertainment to provide some comfort for mental wealth. We have been talking with [SpottieWiFi](https://twitter.com/SpottieWiFi)  as well and like to also to have a event that would be able to include the likes of all the speakers from the conference to possibly be in attendance like [friends](https://twitter.com/brockpierce)   we are able to gain in attendance at the conference.\n\nAs stated above, the plan is to utilize the strategy of deploying funds into:\n\n1.

Merch collaborating with TYME INC. 3K USDC for specialized branded and labeled gear like EX. hats and shirts \n    1. Bring on board the contact as well as community partnerships to be determined with the permission of this passing and DAO aligned agreements following 2day after proposal passes.\n\n 3. 10K for event brand sponsorship at event if possible if not funds returned.\n\n4.   3k for Krause House members in the DAO to attend to represent and do some media coverage of the event to add to personal KH media. \n\nThis is possible to reach over 6k people to be engaged at the event quantum Mami and as well as partnership with a data storage that is eco friendly that has projected growth scale attached  \n\nLINK https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ADS9KDUSFWslF1nS7OL1P_rHdQJdm4pD/view?usp=share_link\n\n\n## OTHER OPTIONS**:**\n\n- brainstorm the next week and deliver a more improved proposal with help for the community and DAO members that feel that this would be a great thing to peruse in the start of 2023!\n- have a TEAM established to add to the planning of the event so that we are able to utilize the possibilities of collaborating within the KH DAO\n\n## TIMELINE:\n\nDEC 11th 2021 - DEC 18th to come to agreement on how to peruse the options needed to make this possible!  Made corrections and established 1-4-2023 need a decision to pre arrange partnerships with people attending.\n\n## DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:\n\n- Krause House DAO Treasury increase by adding to treasury funds with merch available to me to use and present when available.\n- jumpstart a small funding for “All in For Sports”\n- Increase actions with participation in all KH activities aligning projects together at this event that will show unity and provide the look that is needed to prove our value as a DAO.\n\n## Transparency:\n\nTYMED is in talks with SpottieWifi A music NFT celebrity to perform at an event with us and [quantummiami.com](http://quantummiami.com) planning the possibility of attending and representing KH on a Global scale.

We will use the event to promote KH and the talented community we have demonstrating the collective capabilities of the creatives we have in the KH DAO. Leverage our in-person reps form KH, Pig PEN, Ball Hogs, Esports as well as media team working with us to promote things such as gamming as one component as we will have a speaking package to be included in the video at [Quantuim](http://quantummiami.com) miami that they will have developed to promote this event. Are presence here will provide a day-to-day IRL experience for the KH community and drive up the numbers of people who are looking to be a part of our family as well as be apart this 3 day historic event. **TYMED** is apart KH community working daily for us and is looking for all KH members to attend if they are able and encourages everyone to participate and gain $KRAUSE daily with competitive or treasure hunt like activities included in the learning experience of IRL! \n\nLINK https://drive.google.com/file/d/1grYEcBzyp202cBXpnI8ayAmWmLZufvLR/view?usp=share_link\n\nQuantum Miami ,\n\n**What will we be doing at the Quantum Miami ?**\n\nThe “thesis” + “process” is to trust the community to engage and build as we have opportunity for other like minds to incorporate into the DAO aligning common ideas to fulfill our objective. Our mission overall is to create the most fun and family friendly educational experience with people who are looking to become apart the movement with adding to our fan engagement in all of basketball, Esports, and web3 world with the communities who are looking to engage with attaching themselves to our mission to have NBA team. \n\n**How does this benefit Krause House?**\n\nBy talking to people at the event and participations in games we will design and be building helping to establish real relationships, our goal is to give back to people IRL who are involved and those who are not educate we must add education by doing this IRL with them adding the community, so they are able to bring in some of their communities with them. This is very intentional with extra external home-grown relationships that will become part the guild to fostering connections. Use our community to show unity and build a following that the NBA will take a notice at how much fan engagement as well as IRL participation adds to connections with all types of different communities and will add to us that need to increase exponentially building an inclusive community that is diversified. We are going to show how to spread and expand with others no borders as a goal to see all the other people flying into this event from all different areas. Apart the community that we have been web3 natives as well as incorporating community to show they all belong as the individuals they are, all people who join the KH will have their voice be herd given voting privileges and driving engagement through the formation of these friendships and experiences we help add on the building we are doing establishing a solid foundation helping other projects as well with the charity donation to be made via physical labor possibly clanging up the beach one day event .",

For the remainder of the season and post season I will be:\n\n- Moderating the Discord (with the help of @Mario Lopes)\n- Hosting and running fan activations digitally\n- Creating media and engagement content (GIFs, memes, social posts)\n- Building out onboarding framework utilizing Catapult.io, intros.io, and other CRM tools to measure engagement metrics.\n\nPer this proposal, it will be made official in title only that @Greg’s official role is “Uncle Jon’s Boss”\n\nThis does not come with any additional power or control. It is just simply so Greg can say he is my “boss” to me and others.\n\n### Work done so far\n\n- The initial Discord server for the YNG Dreamerz has been assembled and can be joined via this link: [https://discord.gg/EK3at6rw](https://discord.gg/EK3at6rw)\n- I built out a detailed [Notion database](https://www.notion.so/OTE-Basketball-704d7ca09e064ed1a6db5550713ffa09) that documents tasks needed to be done and a content calendar\n- Communication through @Flex Chapman to OTE requesting assets and detailing our approach to growing a strong online basketball fanbase\n\n### Didn’t you just put up a proposal for this last month?\n\nI did, however, I only set the length of it for one month, this proposal will last until the end of the OTE season.\n\nFor this project, OTE is paying the Krause House treasury per a contract we are under with them. There is then a 100% pass through to Uncle Jon’s wallet as comp so there is not net loss from the KH treasury.\n\n### Why does this project matter?\n\nThis project is a massive credibility continuation with Overtime, which is a sports media/league group that has a significant following. After our initial work with them this last month, they have allocated much of their resources to helping us promote the newly created Discord community from their social media accounts.\n\nWe have already proven ourselves after the work done this summer with the Big3 and IRL fan activations and now the ball is in our metaphorical court to do the same type of work digitally. As the boasted “internet’s home team”, a large part of our value driver with front offices is the ability to tap into online communities both in the states and internationally. We have been given free reign to experiment ideas and what we uncover during this project will bolster our eminence in the marriage of web3 and sports.\n\n**### Specification**\n\nThis contributor may submit a request for *up to* the specified amount based on self-assessment of their work.\n\n**### Intention**\n\nThis is intended to encourage contributors to take immediate action on a wide range of problems/opportunities, as opposed to proceeding through the slower process of submitting a proposal for a narrow scope of work.\n\nWe prefer to invest in and groom talent, giving *them* the freedom and capital they need to be entrepreneurs within our community.  We value self-starters who are able to take action and deliver quality work.\n\n**### bUt SomEb0dY m1gHt t@kE t0o mUçh**Both the community and the Stewardship team has the power to cancel this stream if it is being abused.  In addition, if a contributor abuses this trust, they are effectively burning their social credibility and ability to successfully submit proposals in the future.  We expect some lossiness; however, we believe the benefits of getting good work off the ground is worth this small cost.",

While locked it will be recallable in whole or part for negligence or material underperformance of responsibilities as determined by a majority of either core team or stewards, or community vote duly passed.\n\n**Scope of Work**\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of a [previous stream](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x918537d7523f59a2ac228afb0a33d5842a7a14e9f22b745f436ad65d3478b621) that concluded November 30th, 2022.\n\nThe scope of work for this includes up to 3 days per week, or 12 days per month by Lewwwk#4227 focused on:\n\n- Engaging with prospective capital partners, now including endowments, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds.\n- Supporting acquisition leads in coordination and structuring of capital required to complete an acquisition.\n- Supporting other capital initiatives including Krause House Capital Collective and All In for Sport as required and able.\n\n**Purpose of this Work**\n\nAchieving our goals of buying an ownership interest in an NBA team and beyond require the capacity to make or facilitate investments of tens of millions or more. This work ladders up our credibility and capacity for doing so alongside our efforts to build credibility as a preferred ownership partner.\n\n**Results from Previous Work**\n\nThrough work completed under the previous capital coordination streams Lewwwk, in collaboration with Commodore, Flex, and advisors: \n\n- reviewed and/or engaged with multiple team opportunities in the NBA, European football, and other sports\n- tracking 116 teams across the NBA and professional sport\n- managed relationship with key advisors Luis Vicente and Michael Broughton\n- explored and facilitated entity, banking, and contracting options for Krause House\n- established a fiat on/off ramp for Krause House contracts\n- explored compliant tokenization protocols and options for Fund 1 and future capital strategies\n- worked with Peterrr to create [Krause House Captial Collective](https://linktr.ee/krausehousecc) to build a larger capital network and opportunity pipeline\n- supported exploration of external capital options and spin-out strategies for [HeatCheck](https://heatcheck.club/)\n- provide venture formation guidance and support for 'soothsayer's project'\n- supported development of [All In For Sport](https://allinforsport.org/) to strategically build relationships across the sports ecosystem\n- supported the Future of Sport roadmapping project to help inform strategic opportunity areas\n- [presented](https://systemstransformation.xyz) on Krause House as an example of DAO led sector transformation\n- represented Krause House on the first privacy-protected multi-sig in the recent Constitution DAO 2 project.\n\n**Strategy Changes**\n\nWhile sports asset values continue to appreciate and remain in high demand, private equity formation has slowed due to worsening market conditions. As a result Lewwwk, along with advisors, prioritized our capacity to respond to specific opportunities, and intend to use our improving access to opportunities, including potential and actual transactions, to pursue a first close for Fund 1.\n\n**What Does Success Look Like**\n\nOutreach to capital partners and potential LPs will accelerate in the new year as we demonstrate improving access to acquisition opportunities. All activity is targeted toward overarching goals of acquiring a minority position in an NBA team and a first close on an acquisition fund. Progress may be evidenced in a number of ways including:\n\n- Owner validation of Krause House Capital value proposition\n- Interest and soft-commitments from qualified investors\n- Engagement and validation from other key stakeholders\n\nMarket sentiment continues to be bearish with significant macro uncertainties looming that are beyond our control. While sports remains an attractive investment… outcomes continue to have heightened uncertainties.\n\n**Voting Options and Determination**\n\n1. Approve\n2. Needs Significant Edits\n3. Against\n4. Abstain\n\nAbstain votes are discarded. This proposal passes if option 1 (Approve) receives more votes than the greater of options 2 and 3.",

On the ownership side many of those opportunities are beyond the NBA, and on the investment side, many are beyond those that will help us buy an NBA team.\n\nCreating a Krause House Capital Collective, gated by an NFT, allow us to share those opportunities with a broader audience while at the same time attract those outside of Krause House who may later want take the next step to becoming a Jerry. It also builds a receptive audience for new investment opportunities incubated within Krause House. \n\nThe first test of this will be through the creation of a Krause House Capital Collective telegram group(s) token gated through Krause House Capital Collective NFT. Within the telegram we may facilitate community calls around projects of interest to the community and where mutual interest exists make it easier for project proponents and community members to continue conversations directly. Further evolution of the collective will be informed by the community. \n\nSetup and this initial test will be facilitated by Lewwwk#4227 and peterrr#4718 and is a practical continuation of Decentralized Investment Operations and Capital Coordination workstreams.",

      "content": "### Proposal\n\nAllocate $KRAUSE from the existing Gitcoin DEI Grant Program Sponsorship and Participation budget to All In For Sport.\n\n### What is All In For Sport\n\nAll In For Sport (AIFS) is an experiment to create a perpetual funding mechanism to support projects around the world that support inclusion and empowerment through sport. The approach is to collaborate with athletes in development of the traits and 1:1 creations of nouns-style NFTs. Sponsors are invited to contribute to a treasury that supports a reserve price for the auctions. Proceeds from the NFT auctions are available to be granted to projects as selected by the community. \n\nMore about AIFS can be found here: [https://linktr.ee/allinforsport](https://linktr.ee/allinforsport)\n\n### Value Propositions\n\nFor Krause House, this is a way to celebrate what sport brings to people and communities around the world, while demonstrating how decentralized technology and practices can enable community-led governance and increase transparency, trust, and creativity.\n\nFor athletes and sponsors, AIFS also provides an opportunity to proactively demonstrate their support for inclusion and empowerment while using sport as the means for achieving it.\n\nFinally, for Jerrys, this is an opportunity for us to experiment with governance design, build non-commercial collaborations across the ecosystem, and integrate with other Krause House projects like Heat Check, Decentralized Media, and international engagements like the Casa Krause in Guatemala and the Philippines project. Join in through the #aifs channel to learn more.\n\n### Proposal Context\n\nAIFS was created as part of the [Gitcoin DEI Grant Program Sponsorship and Participation Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x795d2b73b44ad50016a81e7657b138970fd2bf321cc75948628db57c66cd15ef). It’s has attracted participation from many Jerrys to date (Shanny, Lewwwk, Phelps, KimR, UncleJohn, Boosh, Samuel, TYMED, Mario, dbag, crabtree), people from outside Krause House, and early interest from individuals and groups with strong relationships with professional athletes. \n\nThe Purpose & Values team has decided to allocate its coordination budget of 5,000 $KRAUSE from that proposal to AIFS to further recognize and encourage participation in the project by new and old Jerrys alike.\n\nThis proposal allows the community to decide how to allocate the remaining 15,000 $KRAUSE which was set aside for project(s) for further accelerate the project. \n\n- Allocate 15,000 $KRAUSE to AIFS\n- Allocate 10,000 $KRAUSE to AIFS\n- Allocate 5,000 $KRAUSE to AIFS\n- Do not allocate any of the project support budget to AIFS\n\nThis will conclude the Gitcoin DEI Grant Program and Sponsorship Participation project and any $KRAUSE not allocated to AIFS will remain in the Krause House treasury.",

      "title": "Engineering Lead (greg)",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nI am requesting a stream of 10,000 USDC / month + 5,000 KRAUSE / month to “**design and develop the infrastructure and applications for the future of fan engagement**.” My working approach will leverage 2-week sprints with highly defined goals and communicated results. I’m using this approach so that we have engineering bandwidth dedicated to the project while also using a well-known efficient process to rapidly iterate through prototypes. \n\nThis role will provide Krause House with the actualization of the “show > tell” strategy Flex has developed.\n\n**My first two-week sprint (and potentially more afterward) will focus on the Content Lab being proposed separately.**\n\nIf at the end of the 3-month period, greg has not produced an ongoing project the DAO is in support of continuing, he will forfeit 50% of his total KRAUSE.\n\n## Primary Goals\n\n- Rapidly develop public-facing products that improve our credibility as leaders in the fan engagement and sports management spaces\n- Leverage partnerships formed by Mario and Flex to demonstrate our ability to provide value to teams and players\n- Ensure there is a full-time high-context engineer providing a technically-minded perspective to complement the work of Flex, Mario, and Commodore\n- Set in place systems and direction for Krause House’s future as it relates to engineering and design\n\n## The Role\n\nIn the short term, his role is intended as highly focused on designing/building/engineering time and *not* management/leading of a dev team. My objective while the building will be to take the wide array of insights and knowledge we’ve gained as a collective and distill it into use cases that are both innovative and useful.\n\nWhat this role will include if this proposal is passed:\n\n- Developing web3 systems and protocols for fan involvement in professional sports teams, especially basketball.\n- Building products and systems that pave the way for Krause House to be a leader in the future of sports.\n- Outlining systems for the future of Krause’s engineering endeavors\n- Purchasing an NBA team with all the other Jerry’s.\n\nWhat this role will not include if this proposal is passed:\n\n- Developing internal DAO tooling\n- Recruiting and onboarding\n- Managing a team\n\nI’ve put a lot of thought into where my strengths and weaknesses lie within the context of Krause House and our goal to own and operate an NBA team. I have also spoken with several Stewards and other high-context individuals within the DAO, and I believe the perspective reflected in this proposal to be an objective evaluation of how I can best impact Krause House.\n\n# Proposal\n\n- A monthly budget of $10,000 USDC + 5,000 $KRAUSE\n- Paid monthly\n- 3 months starting (in arrears) November 14th\n- The stream can be canceled at any point by the DAO through a proposal, at which point future payments will cease (prorated to the day canceled).\n\n# Context\n\nAfter considering my role within Krause House and how I can be an agent for progress toward our goal, I found my first full-time proposal deeply resonated with how I prefer to work. This proposal closely mirrors the original proposal and will focus on rapid iteration to answer the question “What does the future of fandom look like?”\n\nThis is a movement *away* from the direction of my previous proposal which was (in my opinion) a failed attempt to form a team around my original role. A helpful framework I’ve found to think about this is “large team = ambiguity bad, single individual = ambiguity good”. As an individual in a highly autonomous role, I can navigate ambiguity and build things to produce clarity from it. This wasn’t nearly as easy in a team-based role and is the reason for reverting to an individualized stream.\n\n# More Detail\n\n## Working Structure: 2-week Sprints\n\nThis role will be reliant on 2-week sprints to define goals and deliver results. The first week of each sprint will culminate in a clickable prototype demoed on the Thursday town hall. Feedback and insights will then be published on Friday. The second week of each sprint will lead to a released deliverable. This could be a feature added to an existing Krause House product or initiative or a new, standalone deliverable.\n\nThe structure of the sprints on a day-to-day level is subject to change but will mirror the following:\n\n### Week 1:\n\n- Identify problem space\n- Select opportunities within the identified space\n- Decide on a single opportunity\n- Build a prototype with no underlying data\n\n### Week 2:\n\n- (If promising prototype feedback) build MVP of the feature or product\n- (If not promising feedback) revert to week 1\n\nThis approach will maximize our findings through real experimentation while establishing Krause’s credibility to deliver on many of the ideas we pitch.\n\n## Why This Role Matters\n\nAs a DAO, we are operating in unknown territory with limited clarity between us and our goal. Our objective has never been done before and by many is even considered impossible. The difficult macro environment our industry is currently navigating makes the route to our objective even more clouded.\n\nGiven these obstacles, Krause House needs to adopt a strong mentality of “show > tell”. Flex has developed this framework when interacting with owners and has discussed it at length. This role aims to actualize that framework not only for owners and the future of fan-based ownership but the sports industry in general.\n\nBy adopting a lean, two-week iteration mentality, I’ll be able to quickly uncover both opportunities and obstacles in implementing a large number of ideas. Additionally, this will provide both evidence and clarity for Krause House’s approach and value proposition.\n\nThis role serves a secondary function of ensuring there is a high-context engineer on the team full-time. This adds a technically-minded perspective to complement the work of Flex, Mario, and Commodore.\n\n## Initial Project\n\nOut of the gate, I will be using this working structure to work with Crabtree on the Content Lab project being introduced in a separate proposal. I’d like to also find time to work on projects that leverage our recent partnerships with OTE and In The Lab.",

This proposal is to nominate Uncle Jon as the Jerry who would lead our work efforts on their projects.\n\n---\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\n- 7,000 USDC sent to Uncle Jon as up-front payment\n- 250 USDC sent upon completion of podcast episodes (per episode)\n- 1,000 USDC set aside for discretionary spending for travel, accommodations, and supplies\n- 2500 $KRAUSE upon completion of stream\n\n### Why these amounts?\n\n- Karate Combat is paying $4000 USDC (3,000 one-time + 250 per episode for 5 episodes)\n    - Note: KH retains 90% of all revenue generated via the podcast (sponsorships)\n- Overtime Elite is paying $5000 USDC (per month)\n- 250 USD per podcast episode produced (total of 5 episodes for this “phase”)\n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\nFunds will be distributed as requested via Utopia within the allowed budgets listed above. The amounts that are paid from OTE & Karate Combat will 100% pass through to the contributors working on the projects. At the current moment, Uncle Jon is the sole contributor on these two projects. We are expecting some additional help on things such as podcast editing.\n\n1. Uncle Jon will act as team lead (and potentially sole member) and submit requests to Utopia.\n2. Upfront funding to Uncle Jon at 0x2D5803Cb5Cb2Bd90eb242e0162AE5E25B7a31b39\n\n---\n\n# Collaboration Project Details\n\n## Karate Combat\n\nKarate Combat has tapped Krause House to help build out their newly formed DAO. They are a full contact fighting league that is looking to increase their internal Discord engagement. Our scope of work for them is as follows:\n\nConcept\n\n- As a pre-curser to the upcoming $KARATE token drop and the KC37 fight event on December 17th, 2022, Krause House looks to assist in creating audio assets in the form of a “Hard Knocks” style documentary podcast.\n- The podcast will follow along 2 different narratives, it will feature members of the Karate Combat community to highlight internal storylines within the DAO and it will also serve as a way to get in-depth and personal with the fighters on the upcoming fight bill for #KC37\n- Karate Combat DAO Storyline\n    - Since the DAO is in it’s beginning stages, the goal here is to incentivize those curious or inactive in the DAO to become a more involved part of the community and increase engagement.\n    - The first few episodes will be a relaxed conversation with KC DAO leaders, mostly shooting the shit, with a little backstory into how the decision to turn the league into a DAO came about and the hopeful benefits of the initiative\n    - In addition, we’ll dedicate additional episodes for chatting with some of the hosts and influencers involved in announcing the events.\n    - Have 1-2 episodes highlighting discord members and having them discuss their love for combat sports and personal stories.\n- #KC37-38 Storyline\n    - Something we have taken deep notice of is the amount of camaraderie and respect between the fighters on any given week. We’d love to use existing audio from video assets and combine them with sit down interviews between the two fighters facing off and Uncle Jon.\n    - The conversation will be lighthearted and a chance to continue the vibe of respect within this league.\n    - Current DAO/Discord members who are heavily involved will enter a pool (or just be selected) to co-host the fighter podcast. The setting for this will be an informal Rogan-esque conversation.\n\nObjectives\n\n- Significantly increase engagement and activity in the Discord channel.\n- Aside from the obvious financial incentives, fans will now have established relationship incentives.\n- Over the course of the next 5-6 months, we hope to deeply personify the DAO to a collaborative community made up of fans, fighters, influencers, and executives.\n- Successfully “tee up” a master plan to include this audio content as part of the “Up Only Gaming” process\n\n## Overtime Elite Basketball\n\nOvertime Elite has noticed our communities efforts in the Big3 and other fan related projects. They want us to spitball and try different initiatives to create a first-in-class digital fan experience with a few possible IRL activities involved. Some initial project ideas aaaaaaarrrreeee…\n\n- Create and manage a discord server for the YNG Dreamerz\n\n**********************************************************Activities within the Discord**********************************************************\n\n### **NBA Trivia Night**\n\n---\n\n**Context**\n\nWe have been running a trivia night in our own Discord with community members and it has been a huge success. This trivia would mostly be NBA related questions and as we generate more dedicated fandom around the YNG Dreamers, questions will start to be more relevant to OTE players and highlights\n\n**Goals & Key Performance Indicators**\n\n| Goals | KPIs |\n| --- | --- |\n| High Engagement | Total # of participants |\n| Strong Retention | % increase session-to-session |\n\n**Dependencies**\n\n- Access to some merch for giveaways\n- Guest appearances from players from the Dreamerz roster\n\n### **Dreamers Presser/Town Hall**\n\n---\n\n**Context**\n\n- Before each Dreamers game, we’d like to scale out a fan-run press conference and/or town hall between the members and coaches/players. As camaraderie forms within the community between members of the organization and fans, this will begin to feel like an intimate discussion around the game.\n\n**Goals & Key Performance Indicators**\n\n| Goals | KPIs |\n| --- | --- |\n| Increased familiarity between Dreamers & Community members | Increased activity in Discord channels |\n| High engagement during digital activations | Number of questions asked by community members |\n\n**Literally Show & Tell**\n\n---\n\n- This could happen weekly or bi-weekly. We would hold online registration open to all members of the Discord. They would each have roughly 5 minutes to show and tell a cherished item\n\n**Goals & Key Performance Indicators**\n\n| Goals | KPIs |\n| --- | --- |\n| Higher camaraderie between members | Scaled increase in Discord chat activity |\n| For people to have fun | Full registration for every event |\n\n**Fan Spotlight Video**\n\n---\n\n- Each Monday, Wednesday, or Friday we would release a 10 minute sit down casual chit chat between Uncle Jon and a member of the online community. These “guests” would be selected based off their engagement in the community, selected members/guests would be sent a small “dreamer package” containing some kind of small merch.\n- Room to potentially scale to a dedicated “fan experience” for the featured fan with game tickets if local\n\n**Goals & Key Performance Indicators**\n\n| Goals | KPIs |\n| --- | --- |\n| Increase cross-fan collaboration and dialogue | Number of comments and reactions after each fan spotlight |\n| Boost visibility of highly engaged fans | Number of view of fan spotlight |\n\n**Individualized Player Server Channels**\n\n- I’m not entirely sure what this would look like but as we (KH) form relationships with players and coaches I’d love to keep a keen ear open to their own personal interests outside of basketball. Whether thats music, movies, gaming, etc. I think each player having a platform to generate their own rapport with fans is important to generating emotional buy-in of team support. This effort would be scaled, but I think it’s vitally important.\n\n**Goals & Key Performance Indicators**\n\n| Goals | KPIs |\n| --- | --- |\n| Increased player engagement within the community | Players and staff coming forward with their own creative contributions for the community |\n| Have internal Discord members be highly involved in their favorite players projects (possible crossover into web3 NFT’s) | High viewership and reactions for each project released |",

      "title": "Fan-Led Content Lab ",
      "content": "Fan-Led Content Lab \n\nAuthor: crabtree\n\n**********TL;DR********** there’s a lot in this this proposal on how to build this product, but the main takeaway is us building a resource that lets fans decide what basketball content and stories they’d like to see.\n\n### **What Is It?**\n\nThis proposal is about moving us closer to the fan through the two lens they are most attracted to: \n\n1) Content\n\n2) Their own voice\n\nMy thesis is that the NBA and similar sports league digital relationship with fans is consume -> consume -> consume. And it definitely works, but only for the brand.\n\nBut what if the relationship flow was to consume -> participate -> expand -> contribute -> consume?\n\nWhat if the majority of a media effort was ‘fan-led’? If anyone is in a place to solve this puzzle it is Krause House. That’s the idea, **the first fan-led decentralized media effort**.\n\nWe introduce compelling formats, gather interest from fans on what they want to learn about or attend next, produce quality content, then gather more interest and ideas, and keep continuing this cycle.\n\n### Team\n\n- crabtree\n- greg (separate proposal as lead developer among other projects)\n\n### **Intent + Strategy + Project Details**\n\nAll product prototypes: [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/1IzCz3WzSIgbbneITsWs6O/Decentralized-Content-Lab?node-id=5%3A6&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1)\n\nAll email mockups: [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/1IzCz3WzSIgbbneITsWs6O/Decentralized-Content-Lab?node-id=163%3A884&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=147%3A547)\n\nInteractive prototype: [https://content-lab-app.vercel.app/](https://content-lab-app.vercel.app/)\n\nExternally this is about generating interest and adoption to a wide basketball audience. Building demand is the name of the game, no other way around it. Can Krause House generate a real content waitlist and enthusiastic voting environment?\n\nInternally, delivering high quality content is the #1 priority. We want to use our process as a narrative to NBA teams when pitching, so let's lean into what we can be good at.\n\nThe goal is to uncover stories, not regurgitate old ones. I think about us helping the fans surface the stories behind the basketball. The output has to be established at a high level from the start, so quality > quantity matters most in early days. \n\nIn addition livestream/live content is a format we believe can provide early wins due to the production load being taking on by the stream, thus moving fan decisions towards what happens in and around said stream. \n\nCrabtree will lead producing the winning requests and projects voted on by the fans.\n\nGreg will lead building the product, and the decisions on where to improve as it evolves.\n\nWe are starting with a simple email signup to be able to contribute and vote, and then deliver results and drive users back into the product. Email will also be the way to drive users into the ‘Submit’ portion of the product.\n\nEventually we will build a referral system that awards votes for bringing in fellow fans.\n\n### **Philippines Rollout**\n\nTesting the Philippines market is one of our early goals to understand 1) what user acquisition methods work and 2) which formats have high engagement with international fans.\n\nWe believe many of the lessons here can be applied to U.S. and Canada markets as we continue to scale the product.\n\nIn addition this effort will compliment the groundwork our team has already put into this country’s fans.\n\n### **Format**\n\n**These are the first round of concepts, not final GTM plans.**\n\n### Krause House Stories: A series around the original, the unique, and the in-depth tales of Basketball\n\nStories Voting Portal: [Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/1IzCz3WzSIgbbneITsWs6O/Decentralized-Content-Lab?node-id=5%3A495&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1)\n\nNovelty, novelty, novelty. This format calls for producing stories with high-end production and in-depth research. This is our chance for fans to produce mini-versions of ‘30 for 30s’\n\nOur working plan is to produce at monthly intervals, or have voters reach a threshold that moves a ‘Story’ into production (e.g. we will produce XYZ Story if it receives 1000 votes).\n\nLong Term Vision:\n\nShow the ability to crowdsource and produce narratives that can compete with top media groups.\n\nImmediate Distribution:\n\nUse Twitter, TikTok, IG and YouTube for releases.\n\nInsert discussion on topics in threads, as well as promoting voting in niche communities and threads.\n\n### Player Spotlight Stories\n\nPlayer Voting Portal: [Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/1IzCz3WzSIgbbneITsWs6O/Decentralized-Content-Lab?node-id=5%3A6&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1)\n\nCommunity submits and votes on individual players to be spotlighted each week. The output is telling the story of a mix of up-and-coming, role, or unique players…less around stars and over-discussed players.\n\nPotential coverage for each spotlight, all segments voted on by the community: current overview, high school, college, draft, progression to now, video breakdowns, advanced stats, etc.\n\nThis is critical for educating the more casual fan, domestic or foreign, to the player's origin.\n\nAlso shows the DAO’s capability to dive deep on a full range of players (a.k.a. any team’s roster).\n\nLu Dort example I spun up in 15 minutes: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/k1q9dj5kzivu8c8/lu%20story.mp4?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/k1q9dj5kzivu8c8/lu%20story.mp4?dl=0)\n\nLong Term Vision:\n\nShow ability to educate any fan at any interest level about a player that intrigues them (but doesn’t have time to do this on their own).\n\nImmediate Distribution:\n\nUse Twitter, TikTok, IG and YouTube for releases.\n\nUse personal Twitter to insert discussion on players in threads, as well as promoting voting in niche communities and threads.\n\n### The Afterparty/ The Morning Show\n\nPostgame Voting Portal: [Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/1IzCz3WzSIgbbneITsWs6O/Decentralized-Content-Lab?node-id=5%3A551&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1)\n\nCommunity submits and votes on a ‘late night show’ or ‘morning show’ concept for game(s) each week. We will test both formats.\n\nWhen teams win, their fans are still on their high, all they want to do is go to some digital forum and rewatch and reignite that high. The IRL version of this is ecstatic fans going to a post-game bar and just talking it all out with other fans. The same happens with a loss.\n\nFans vote on which plays or themes to break down after the games are completed. Think of this as a KH instant analysis reaction show.\n\nColorful recaps are exactly what casual fans want. This is a really important way to engage fans who don’t watch full games but want entertaining stories from the field. \n\nIn the early days focusing on marquee matchups could be a preferred route, but we should trust the voting structure. It could be that fans prefer traditional recaps for the biggest games of the week, and enjoy alternative efforts for lesser games.\n\nLong Term Vision:\n\nBecome a top alternative to post-game consumption of an NBA game.\n\nImmediate Distribution:\n\nUse Twitter and Instagram to push and poll during a game, driving visitors to contributing on the site.\n\n### Krause House Gameday (livestreamed games)\n\nPlayer Voting Portal: [Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/1IzCz3WzSIgbbneITsWs6O/Decentralized-Content-Lab?node-id=5%3A639&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1)\n\nHost Voting Portal: [Link](https://www.figma.com/proto/1IzCz3WzSIgbbneITsWs6O/Decentralized-Content-Lab?node-id=5%3A223&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1)\n\nCommunity submits and votes on an individual livestreamed game hosted and commentated by KH each week. The world by which the fans consume the game is changing. We are beginning to see a lot of these alternative broadcasts that are taking place...It's becoming an interesting way to watch the game and hear the game and learn about the game.\n\nThe approach is to let fans vote on the game and specific content to build up the week.\n\nThere is the opportunity to bring on different voices and Jerrys for live game commentary, even having different voices for different segments of the game. Think ManningCast evolution over the past few years. \n\nIn the early days focusing on marquee matchups could be a preferred route, but we should trust the voting structure. It could be that fans prefer traditional streams for the biggest games of the week, and enjoy alternative streams for lesser games.\n\nLong Term Vision:\n\nBecome a top alternative to live consumption of an NBA game.\n\nImmediate Distribution:\n\nFigure out the best streaming option that is enjoyable and legal! Promote across channels.\n\nOther prototypes:\n\n[Archive Page](https://www.figma.com/proto/1IzCz3WzSIgbbneITsWs6O/Decentralized-Content-Lab?node-id=119%3A168&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1)\n\n[Login Lightbox](https://www.figma.com/proto/1IzCz3WzSIgbbneITsWs6O/Decentralized-Content-Lab?node-id=5%3A682&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1)\n\n[Submit Page](https://www.figma.com/proto/1IzCz3WzSIgbbneITsWs6O/Decentralized-Content-Lab?node-id=119%3A296&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1)\n\n### **Creators**\n\nOnce we establish a baseline for formats, this can be a channel to further engage basketball creators and tap into their reach. A basketball creator/influencer can jump in to host a livestream, create a video with their style, and more….there’s even potential to have fans vote on which creator they want to interact with.\n\nOn the high end of creator spectrum, we have the option to white label a portion of the product for branded voting experiences. Example: In The Lab are the hosts of our weekly livestream → a vote on which game they are breaking down → their audience is introduced to KH and continues to vote on livestream concepts.\n\n### Reporting\n\nTo start each weekly interval (Sunday or Monday) stats can be reported to the DAO: new signups, total signups, allocation of votes on different formats, social stats on the outputs, etc. I can also make this a reporting segment during Town Halls.\n\nAs we evolve the product we will be able to report on concepts such as referrals, power users, and other product trends.\n\nI want to again emphasize this is about starting small and right. Growing adoption week over week is bigger than a massive attention grab in Day 1. If we get enough reps and keep improving the quality there are opportunities for outputs to take off.\n\n### **Outcomes and Value Propositions for Krause House**\n\n### Fan-Owned\n\nThis is Krause House. A step in continuing to become ‘The Internet’s Home Team’ if successful.\n\n### Media\n\nNew subscribers, followers, and reach are always critical to KH efforts. Over time this should snowball to increase those counts.\n\nWe can also use this to attract voices and personalities if they enjoy the format, thus a vehicle to amplify their efforts we simultaneously benefit from. Early groups we will pitch will be Ball Is Life and In The Lab. \n\nA side effect of these efforts is finding out what content is most engaging once it's out in the wild. This allows us to rapidly innovate on winning content while receiving submissions on new types.\n\n### Acquisition\n\nUsers entering the product allows us to figure out their value over time outside of an email in a CRM. Can they be tied to MyJerry/ Heat Check efforts? Can they be pushed to KH Discord and Jerry’s Digest? Can this lead them to bigger decisions that benefit KH?\n\n### Brand\n\nIt’s another project to show our elite range of web3 innovation, media ability, and product building.\n\nKrause House can continue to insert itself as a respected basketball powerhouse.\n\n### What This Is Not\n\nHighlight Reel Series\n\n- This isn’t our north star. Competing with in-house media teams and the many basketball social accounts chopping up videos for views is the wrong battle to fight.\n\nSimilar Ongoing Efforts\n\n- This is not meant to mirror Around the Association or Krause House DAO podcasts. I consider those more macro media efforts. It’s also not a podcast.\n- This effort takes a wide range of input for detailed output: *It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel. So deep, it's picked up on radios in tunnels - GZA*\n\nStatistics Play\n\n- Not in the business of entering the social stats war. We can properly introduce them in the project but trying to be the leader in this space is a rat race.\n- Fun example of how low the bar can be: [Statmuse vs BR](https://twitter.com/statmuse/status/1584746443331743744?s=46&t=w64yA5tZNw8qSGEwt06bMg)\n\nHot Takes, Clickbait, and Low Quality Humor\n\n- We’re not trying to pump out lower quality content via memes, clickbait, obvious poor stances to rile up certain fans, or anything else to attract users the ‘wrong way’.\n\n### Development\n\n**MVP Acceptance Criteria**\n\n- User can create an account using their email\n- User receives 10 initial votes on account creation\n- User can burn their votes to vote on potential content\n- User receives 5 new votes every Sunday evening\n- User can view created and upcoming content\n- Admin can add and remove content to vote on\n- Admin can upload created content\n\n**Post-MVP Enhancements**\n\n- User can invite a friend via email, if they accept both users receive 10 extra votes\n- User can tweet about a vote with the click of a button (and receive a vote multiplier for doing so)\n- Marketing-oriented landing page\n- … and much more\n\n### Funding\n\n**Build/Content/Marketing** **Costs (crabtree)**\n\n$5,500 USD/month & 3,500 $KRAUSE/month for 3 months\n\n- MVP product management, copy, and design\n- All content production\n- Email rollout\n- Livestream and/or live show hosting\n- Daily marketing and fan engagement\n- Estimated 25-30 hours/week to prove out beta.\n\nDevelopment (greg)\n\nGreg will be writing a separate funding proposal for his work but will be the dedicated developer for this project.",

Summary\n\nCommodore, Flex Chapman, & Mario are requesting to [renew their full-time team charter](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x14085de0ef04577325cd61e06f1cd3b83ce7325960edb19eace702624b5160a4).\n\n### Primary Goals\n\n- Execute a letter of intent for a minority position of an NBA team [LOI] (very hard)\n- Pitch more NBA owners (hard)\n- Execute a treasury diversification (hard)\n- Capitalize on meaningful partnership opportunities (hard)\n- Operate core functions of the DAO [legal, financial, community, etc] (normal)\n\n### Team Member Main Responsibility\n\nEach team member works across the DAO on many fronts.  However, they have one primary responsibility.  More detail on objectives are outlined in the Details section.\n\n- Flex: Securing Letter of Intent (LOI) — Generate Leads/Pitch Opportunities\n- Commodore: Securing Letter of Intent (LOI) — Financial <> Legal <> Web3 Coordination\n- Mario: Build and manage systems to leverage the power of our community.\n\n---\n\n# 2. Proposal\n\n- A monthly budget of $40,001 USDC + 10,000 $KRAUSE\n- Paid monthly\n- 6 months starting (in arrears) November 1, 2022.\n- Contributors can be fired at any point by the DAO through proposal, at which point future payments will cease (prorated to the day fired).\n- Members of this team must retain 100% of their airdropped allocation of $KRAUSE balances for 2 years (as of Jan 1st, 2022) or until no longer being compensated as a full-time contributor.\n\n**Monthly Spend**\n\n| Name | $USDC | $KRAUSE |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Commodore | 16,667 | 0 |\n| Flex Chapman | 14,167 | 2,500 |\n| Mario Lopes | 9,167 | 7,500 |\n| Total | 40,001 | 10,000 |\n\n---\n\n# 3. Core Team Check-in\n\n1. Where are our plans for the DAO?\n2. What’s our plan for DAO finances?\n3. How can you help?\n\n### Where are our plans for the DAO?\n\n1. **Secure a Letter of Intent:** Securing a minority position in an NBA team is the next major step in our mission.  In addition, this helps plant the seeds for objective (2) and (3).  This requires cultivating relationships with NBA teams and aggressive networking by this team.\n2. **Raise for KH Capital:** Work with KH Capital (Lewwwk & others) to close a $100m+ PE Fund that will backstop KH sub-DAO equity positions. Equity positions in sports clubs will exist within a fully KYC’d, NBA by-law, & SEC compliant entity as a sub-DAO. KH Capital provides us the ability to structure a legal entity that sports clubs can interact with legally & compliantly, while KH Capital delegates access + governance to Krause House where allowed. Additionally, this gives us negotiation leverage to verbally commit to large sums of capital without knowing KH members’ appetite due to KH Capital being able to backfill any remaining allocation. Note: Closing a LOI with a NBA team is a massive accelerant to getting this fund closed.  \n3. **DAO Treasury Diversification:** Once we secure a LOI, we intend to diversify our balance of $KRAUSE & USDC / ETH.\n4. **Community Engagement:** Our community is our unfair advantage, and one of our core focuses is to cultivate richer community spirit. The early days of KH thrived pre-token, and we aim to bring this entrepreneurial spirit back to the community.  Part of the intention of moving towards mechanisms like Coordinape is to allow Jerry’s to “get after it” in any way, without permission, in a maximally “do-ocratic” way.  On top of this, we will experiment with new methods and platforms to connect Jerry’s with KH & each other.  Ultimately, the Krause House journey means nothing without camaraderie, new friends, and memories. WAGBAT.\n\n### What’s our plan for DAO finances?\n\nAt this moment, we have roughly $1.3MM our [Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4762eacebdb7585d32079fdcba5bb94eb5d76f2) and [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x40eDBC75C543954CDD9c5ae7398342788F46A85B) treasuries. Our community, talent, DAO infrastructure, brand, and network is a non-reproducible, organic, confluence of factors that puts Krause House in a unique position to succeed with our vision. It would be a mistake to shift to a defensive posture. \n\n1. We expect to pass less project proposals in USDC, and favor a more entrepreneurial style of funding via mechanisms like (but not limited to) Coordinape gift circles.\n2. We also hope to expand the full-time team if we have the opportunity to bring on member who materially advances our ability to close a LOI with an NBA team, and/or deliver treasury diversification. \n3. It also should be noted that part of Flex & Commodore's objectives is to execute a Treasury Diversification to increase USDC and/or ETH in the treasury.\n\n### How can you help?\n\nWhile we hope to nudge the DAO towards less project based funding, we intend to make contributing to the mission easier by allowing Jerry’s to earn **without submitting a proposal**.\n\n---\n\n# 4. More Detail\n\n1. Objectives + Responsibilities\n2. Retrospective\n\n## a. Objectives / Responsibilities\n\n### Commodore - “Closer”\n\nWhen discussing with ownership groups, there comes a moment when the idea at a high-level resonates, but we need to get into how it all would actually work. That is where Commodore’s background & accomplishments set the credibility of the pitch on the details on what / how this could work. Our solution has to be serve the needs of KH but also fit within compliance of NBA by-laws & SEC regulations. Teams will sometimes have customizations (such as 50% women ownership) suggestions that need to be structured into our offer. Commodore excels at providing the details on how this will all work across the four important domains of finance, legal, regulatory, & web3. \n\n### Flex - “Top of Funnel”\n\nA combination of charm, vibes, & intellect allows Flex to find his way into introductions + partnerships with entities to deliver our goal. His ability to connect on a human level, then inspire with the broad vision has gotten us into meetings & conversations that are incredibly difficult to network your way into. Flex drives camaraderie on a human level on our pitches while also able to inspire with creative solutions to their needs. Flex is also the design eye behind every slide of our well designed decks. The number of NBA pitches, partnerships, & venture capitalists relationships who are interested in treasury diversification opportunities Flex provides is unmatched. \n\n### Mario - “Level 99 Jerry”\n\nFrom the day he entered the Discord, Mario has taken initiative to build and maintain systems that welcome Jerry’s and leverage their ability and energy towards our mission. While he works across all areas of the DAO, his primary role will be continuing to engage the community and harness the crowd. As a part of this, Mario will be responsible for scaling the [Heat Check](https://twitter.com/heatcheckapp) app, which accelerates our partnership conversations & gives us a potential revenue generating project that the DAO recently approved. \n\n## b. Retrospective\n\n[Full retrospective is available here](https://gist.github.com/thycommodore/a3122b90e7a8f7b45e082abd05b2c28c).\n\n### Commodore\n\nSummary: Delivered core obligations to the DAO (legal, financial, NBA purchase, & town halls).

      "title": "Product Team Renewal",
      "content": "# Product Team Renewal\n\nBy dog, greg, trik\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to outline what the Product Team will be building for the next 3 months and how it will benefit Krause House DAO as well as improve our odds of acquiring an NBA team (or any other professional team).\n\nThis proposal will be for a 3-month period, starting November 1.\n\nDuring the next 3 months, the Product Team will be focused on delivering two main products: **Krause House Quiz Show and Dynamic NFTs.**\n\n## Budget Request and Delivery Specifications\n\n- Trik: $8,000 USDC and 5,000 KRAUSE /month.\n- Greg: compensation will be given after the delivery of a product. The total compensation will be based on Greg’s anticipated total time spent on that product and his monthly rate of $12,000 and 5000 KRAUSE. We estimate 160 hours of development for the Quiz Show app and 160 for Dynamic NFTs, so Greg is requesting $12,000 and 5,000 KRAUSE at delivery of each product.\n- Dogstoevsky’s existing stream of $8,000 and 5,000 KRAUSE /month will only continue based on this proposal passing.\n- $2,000 and 1,000 KRAUSE for quiz show rewards, legal fees (for dynamic NFT compliance), and cloud services. The DAO can keep whatever the product team ends up not needing to request.\n\n## Krause House Quiz Show\n\n### Details and Purpose\n\nThe past two weeks of doing the Krause House Quiz Show has demonstrated that there is an interest from the Krause House community in continuing the internal engagement. The reception has been very positive to the show and our wonderful host UncleJon.\n\nIn the last 2 weeks, we've had a turnout (excluding prod. team + jon) of 12 and 11 participants for the 1st and 2nd quiz respectively. Between both quizzes, we’ve re-engaged several previously lurking members and onboarded some brand new members to the DAO.\n\nWe'd like to take this proof of concept further and build a real web application that Krause House can use to host the Quiz Show and scale its impact by going beyond the limitations of a Discord server. Long-term, we believe the foundation of this quiz app could allow Krause House to host other shows like NBA predictions, live podcasts, and more. This allows Krause House to fully become its own \"ESPN\" for any future teams we acquire. Pre-team ownership, this Quiz Show can be used to grow the Krause House community and bring more awareness to the brand.\n\n### Opportunities Beyond a Humble Discord Bot\n\nThe Discord quiz show was helpful to show that this general concept was something the community really desired. Building a dedicated platform to host the show outside Discord creates many new opportunities for Krause House. \n\nFirstly, going beyond Discord allows KH to achieve scale since the Discord quiz show is not scalable. The bot doesn’t display a leaderboard properly beyond 10 participants and the chatting interferes with the game. These things are fine when the quiz show has less than 20 people, but beyond that, the UX rapidly deteriorates. A better quiz bot could be built to address leaderboard issues, but the chatting issue is a fundamental flaw of having to host the quiz bot in a text-channel. \n\nSecondly, building an independent product allows KH to have an offering that we can bring to future sports teams that we own and operate. The quiz could be white-labelled for whichever team we own. Hosting the quiz show outside Discord, as either a web app or mobile app, reduces the barrier to entry. Many people are not familiar with Discord and even after joining don’t pay close attention to what happens within the server. This is evident by the lack of engagement within Krause House’s channels. Removing the Discord prerequisite makes this an easy way for an individual to stay in-touch with a community on a low-commitment but consistent basis. \n\nFinally, hosting the quiz show outside Discord creates monetization opportunities. While the quiz show can be used for future KH-controlled teams, it can also be created as an offering for other teams and DAOs that are unaffiliated with Krause House or basketball. Additionally, there are opportunities to generate cash from upsells, advertisements, sponsorships, and more, that can’t be achieved within Discord. \n\n### Target Audience\n\nThis app will be for the online-native NBA fan hardcore enough to be talking smack on Twitter. The target audience of the quiz show overlaps with the segment of Krause House that joins the DAO for the opportunities to socialize and meet people passionate about basketball (as opposed to the segments that join to learn about web3 or contribute labor).\n\n### Delivery Details\n\nBefore January 1st, the product team will deliver an MVP of this app that allows users to:\n\n- Input an email address for future communications and reward fulfillment\n- View a livestream of a quiz show host\n- Select answers to a quiz question\n- Chat with other live viewers\n- View a leaderboard for the quiz\n\nAdditionally, the app will: \n\n- Allow an admin to upload questions via a password protected dashboard\n\nWhen these delivery details are met, Greg will be allocated compensation according to the budget section above. Greg will track his time spent on this individual product and be paid a daily rate depending on the number of days worked. \n\n## Dynamic NFTs\n\n### Details and Purpose\n\nConcept: [https://krausehouse.unicornplatform.page/](https://krausehouse.unicornplatform.page/)\n\nKrause House is in a strong position to explore and experiment with the nascent space of dynamic NFTs.\n\nDynamic NFTs are something that are becoming increasingly prevalent and seem to be the next frontier of the NFT landscape. They allow the gamification of collectibles and the ability to give people an increased stake in the outcomes of games.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors originally laid the foundation for this and how it can be done within regulatory guidelines ([https://gswnft.com](https://gswnft.com/)). This is a concept that we have heard other NBA teams are interested in and it's also something the NBA has already dipped their toe into with their \"The Association\" NFTs.\n\nWe'd like to build out a working site to sell dynamic NFTs (as a proof of concept and compliance sandbox) while building the rails for this feature to be applied to In The Lab, Heat Check, and any future NBA teams (or other teams). This could be a way to bring huge value to a future NBA team and can in the meantime be used to generate revenue for Krause House.\n\nIn The Lab (ITL) has already expressed serious intent in doing a dynamic NFT project with Krause House and recently signed a partnership agreement making KH one of their official web3 partners.\n\n### Business Opportunities\n\nThere are two ways these Dynamic NFTs can make money for Krause House. \n\n1. Traditional and straightforward: as a consumer-facing web2.5 product, these NFTs could be sold to people to generate profit for the DAO. It’s natural to believe that selling NFTs in a crippling bear market is doomed to fail, but this product is not being built to rely on the speculation that drove the prices of previous NFT projects. The idea here is to deliver value to consumers and to gamify outcomes in ways that have not been previously possible due to regulations. NFTs are simply the vehicle that allows this idea to be compliant.  \n2. B2B: this product could be sold as an enterprise solution to various entertainment companies. In The Lab has already expressed interest in using Dynamic NFTs for their influencer basketball games and some of their other consumer brands. Much in the same way that GSW had success with this concept, we could bring this to other sports teams as a new and unique way to generate location-agnostic revenue from their fan base. \n\n### Target Audience\n\nThis app will be for NBA super fans that are looking to get more involved in the outcomes of their favorite teams or players. The specific type of fan will depend on the outcome being attached to the NFT. NFTs based on team outcomes (such as the concept linked above) have shown based on some feedback in the DAO to be most appealing to fans characterized by being loyal to one specific team, owning that team’s NBA merchandise, and betting or playing fantasy sports. The audience may shift slightly if the product pivots to focus on player outcomes.\n\n### Delivery Details\n\nBefore February 1st, the product team will deliver an MVP of this app that allows users to:\n\n- Create an account where NFT rewards will be fulfilled\n- Buy NFTs with a credit card and custodial wallet\n- Unlock rewards based on external conditions + NFT holdings\n    - Pick rewards from a list of options\n- Login to view progress towards receiving their reward\n\nAdditionally, the product team will:\n\n- Create a compliance document detailing the limitations of dynamic NFTs based on regulatory requirements\n\nWhen these delivery details are met, Greg will be allocated compensation according to the budget section above. Greg will track his time spent on this individual product and be paid a daily rate depending on the number of days worked. \n\n## Responsibility Clause\n\nIf any emergent work for NBA teams arises, the team will be available as needed related to NBA ownership acquisitions.\n\nIf an opportunity presents itself, members of the product team may need to reallocate 10-90% of their time and would be impossible to predict currently.\n\nProduct team members will prioritize work necessary to purchase a share in an NBA team. While funded members will attempt to continue these projects, time allocation will lean towards an NBA opportunity. In the event such an opportunity arises, Trik will continue his stream while Greg will submit a new proposal detailing the deliverable he works towards.",

      "title": "Create Coordinape $KRAUSE Budget",
      "content": "Author: Spice \n\n---\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\n1. Give newcomers a place to prove themselves while getting some compensation if they deliver results.\n2. Allow the DAO to vet newcomers before proposals and build trust.\n3. Incentivize sporadic contribution from the broader community.\n4. Distribute $KRAUSE to contributors who are not being paid otherwise.\n\n---\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\n40,000 $KRAUSE to a Coordinape CoVault: `0x2d74e850ad7712390a137465ba273c8334c0e6b5`\n\nCoordinape Admins: Stewards Team\n\n### How will funds be used?\n\nPayout contributors via Coordinape for an estimated 5 months.\n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\n$KRAUSE will be send to a Coordinape CoVault, which will handle payouts at the end of each month based on results.\n\nStewards Team can modulate the total amount allocated each month, but we plan to use 8,000 $KRAUSE / month initially. If there is little contribution, they can turn the distribution down, and vice versa.\n\nStewards Team can cancel this mode of funding for any reason at any time.\n\n---\n\n### Why?\n\n**Crowdfund contributors are being massively diluted in governance weight relative to contributors earning from the DAO.**\n\nIn our current system, large amounts of $KRAUSE are going to individuals who are earning USDC for their work.  Most contributor streams dish out a few thousand $KRAUSE per month.  For context, a genesis Upper Level NFT granted 100 $KRAUSE of voting power.  If a contributor earns even 2000 $KRAUSE per month, they are receiving 20x the voting power of a crowdfund participant ***per month***.  This is creates a dynamic where contributors are gaining *massive* governance weight over the very people who are funding their contribution. \n\n*This proposal is meant to steer more $KRAUSE towards those who are not benefitting financially from the DAO.*  This should help get votes into the hands of individuals with clear goodwill to the DAO, who just want to help and don’t necessarily ask for compensation.  It also helps escape potential DAO capture where crowdfunders are unable to stop contributors from depleting the treasury.\n\n**What is Coordinape?**\n\nCoordinate is a tool where community members allocate credit/praise to others based on their contributions to the DAO that month.  This allows more Jerry’s to both earn and have a say in where $KRAUSE gets allocated.\n\nCheck out their docs here: [https://docs.coordinape.com/](https://docs.coordinape.com/)",

      "content": "Author: Edgy Brah\n\n---\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\nCollab between EstuDAO x Krause House DAO & pursuing due dilligence with the team.\n\nEstuDAO is aiming at adquiring & operating stakes in Estudiantes, famous basketball club in Spain.\n\nThe aim is for Krause House to become the main partner, helping: finance, build legal structure, operate the international community of the DAO, help build the Web3 ecosystem around it.\n\n---\n\n### How will funds be used?\n\nActivating the community; developing web3 technology; building contributor stream system; purchasing team stakes.\n\n### Project Details\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe aim of this proposal is for KH & EstuDAO to start working together towards a Due Dilligence process with the club & eventualy purchase & operate it. WAGBAT!\n\nIn this document we express the main points about the history of Estudiantes from Madrid, a professional basketball team that currently plays LEB Gold, the second division of the Spanish system behind the ACB League.\n\nAlong with this information, reference will be made to **EstuDAO**, an organization aiming to achieve the goal of being able to make the majority purchase of shares that allow us to have a prominent place in the management of the club.\n\nThe information contained in this document is of a public nature & most of the figures were obtained from public records, however, there is unofficial information, which may be contrasted prior to the execution of any action through the due diligence process.\n\n**Basketball in Spain**\n\nSpanish basketball just had an extremely successfull Eurobasket with:\n\n- Spain has competed in all 8 finals (men, women, u18, etc.)\n- 4 of the men´s team come from Estu\n\n**Legal context of sports institutions in Spain**\n\nIn Spanish basketball, there is a league of professional clubs & a Federation that encompasses all the other competitions of less professionalized or totally amateur clubs & also those of training young players.\n\nThe [Association of Basketball Clubs](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asociaci%C3%B3n_de_Clubes_de_Baloncesto) (ACB) organizes the 1st [league](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liga_ACB), composed of 18 teams at the highest level of competition. Each year the last 2 in the league standings are relegated to the LEB division; the ACB League, which makes winning more meaningful that in the NBA. The LEB is organized by the [Spanish Basketball Federation](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federaci%C3%B3n_Espa%C3%B1ola_de_Baloncesto).\n\nThe Spanish ACB teams compete in [Europe](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa) in the championships organized by the [ULEB](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ULEB) & also in the championships organized by [FIBA Europe](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Europa).\n\nMadrid is the largest city in Spain & the second largest in the European Union, with a population of more than 3 million inhabitants (more than 6 million in the metropolitan area).\n\n**ECONOMIC REQUIREMENTS TO PLAY THE ACB**\n\nThe initial investment is already around €3.5 million between the minimum budget required & the value of participation, which is paid in 4 seasons.\n\nACB values on the first place, the accounts report that must be presented. This is an external audit that is commissioned for clubs that are promoted to evaluate their economic health.\n\nIn this way, the ACB seeks to minimize risks that damage the reputation of the competition & affect the rest of the clubs. On the other hand, the external audit is followed by an examination of budgets. This is a process that all the teams go through.\n\nAfter passing both financial tests, clubs must meet a number of business & technical requirements. The first is to cover the participation fee, which in the old days could be equated to the canon. This value is a payment that clubs make when competing in a private league. The total amount is 1.9 million euros, although it is split into four different years.\n\nEach club pays about 488,000 euros per year over four years, which is returned at the time of relegation to LEB Gold. In case of achieving permanence, instead of making this full payment, the ACB deducts a proportional part of the audiovisual & sponsorship distribution. It is a complex position for clubs, as it is an important burden when setting budgets.\n\nOnce all the steps for registration have been completed & the audits have been passed, the teams must draw up a budget. The minimum is 2.5 million euros, although today almost none of them go below three million. Last year only three clubs started below this amount: Breogán, Manresa & Fuenlabrada.\n\n**EUROLIGA & ACB Budget**\n \n![Untitled.png](ipfs://bafkreihqqkypgmbw6auky4usqezst4arn4s3gqh6lq4nviva7njwoumgyu)\n \n![Untitled2.png](ipfs://bafkreihqqkypgmbw6auky4usqezst4arn4s3gqh6lq4nviva7njwoumgyu)\n    \n![Untitled3.png](ipfs://bafkreiauhuzwu7aiop6mh4ryuaj325yqevx3vetk5yty4sfitfdan43ziu)\n    \n\n**Profitability of a basketball team in Europe**\n\nEuropean basketball is not very sustainable NOWADAYS, with a model based on the purchase of players because clubs pay more than they are capable of generating. The prospects are not good as long as there are no teams & fans in London & Paris, as the low penetration in the UK, France & Germany is the great drag on the take-off of the business.\n\n**Information about Movistar Estudiantes**\n\n**History**\n\nEstudiantes is a historic basketball team from Madrid, Spain, founded in 1948 which competed  in the ACB league until 2021, the men's team is currently playing in the LEB Gold League.\n\nThe Club Estudiantes was founded by a group of students from the Ramiro de Maeztu secondary school, supported by the latin language professor Antonio Magariños. Since they weren't allowed to compete under the name of their school, they decided to do so by describing what they were: students. Those students planted a seed that little by little began to germinate.\n\nThey also own a women's team, & are also particularly famous for their renowned youth academy with over 2,000 players (one of the largest in Europe).\n\nSome of his achievements include: winning 3 Spanish Cups & reaching the ACB Finals in 2004.\n\nThe youth academy has produced many great Spanish players such as: Juancho Hernangómez, Sergio Rodríguez, Felipe Reyes, Pepu Hernández, Aíto García Reneses or Carlos Jiménez, Fern&o Martín, the first Spaniard to reach the NBA & play for the Portl& TrailBlazers, was also a product of the club.\n\nThe 98-99 season was huge: MJ was close to sign for Estudiantes ([Link)](https://www.movistarestudiantes.com/prensa/noticias/cu&o-michael-jordan-pudo-jugar-en-el-estu/)\n\n**Fans**\n\nEstudiantes has historically had some of the most passionate fans in the ACB league, but recent struggles on & off the court have left the fan base upset & disappointed.\n\nThey feel that their team has been taken away from them.\n\nThere are around 50k Estudiantes fans in Spain, the club is linked to a high school, so it receives around 100-200 new fans every year (former students & parents).\n\nLink: [https://twitter.com/MovistarEstu](https://twitter.com/MovistarEstu)\n\n**Structure**\n\nThe club has 3 main structures. The SAD (Sociedad Anónima Deportiva), which represents professional teams, Estudiantes Asociación Civil, which represents the club & youth academy, & Fundación Estudiantes, a non-profit organization that carries out charity actions.\n\nEstudiantes has the 2nd highest paid sponsor in Spanish basketball, [Movistar](https://www.movistar.es/), an important telecommunications company in Spain & Latam that pays 3M€ every year until 2025.\n\nThey currently play at the Wizink Center, the same stadium where Real Madrid Basketball plays, the 2nd largest basketball stadium in Spain.\n\nThe club has a men's team that plays in the 2nd division, a women's team that plays in the 1st division & the largest basketball quarry in Europe.\n\nThe workforce is around 35 people & has a direct & indirect impact on more than 100 families.\n\n**Social impact of the club**\n\nThe club has the largest youth academy in Europe. It has been developing social projects for 20 years.\n\nThey know that sport is, among other things, a great transmitter of values such as cooperation, autonomy, decision making, equality, respect (learning to win) & tolerance to frustration (learning to lose). That is why they carry out activities & projects that link these & other ethical values with sporting values & bring sport & basketball to people who have fewer opportunities to reach them.\n\nThe [adapted schools](http://www.movistarestudiantes.com/fundacion-estudiantes/equipos-y-escuelas/), the [training](http://www.movistarestudiantes.com/educacion/) projects [for employment](http://www.movistarestudiantes.com/educacion/), the solidarity calendar & [awareness actions](http://www.movistarestudiantes.com/acciones-solidarias/) are an example of the line that Fundación Estudiantes follows.\n\n**Club news**\n\nEstudiantes celebrates its 75th anniversary in its biggest sporting, economic & institutional crisis in living memory. The debt is suffocating, the men's, women's & youth sports project is an unknown quantity.\n\nThe current president (Fern&o Galindo) stepped aside, & a new one was announced (Ignacio Triana) who expects an ephemeral m&ate while waiting for a new investor.\n\nIn order to address the delicate situation that the club is going through, the club closed a financing round amounting to 1.21 million euros, last november, after burning through a capital raise of €5M.\n\nThe entity's shareholding consists of five partners with a stake of more than 5% of the capital: Fundación Estudiantes, with 19.52%; Club Estudiantes de Baloncesto, with 6.64%; Fern&o Galindo (former president of the entity), with 11.56%, Vicente Olivenza (president of the Altafit Group) & Ignacio Triana (founder & CEO of Forus), with 12.46%.\n\nAfter the relegation to LEB Gold in 2020-2021, the organization had a budget of 1.7 million euros & still dragged a debt of four million euros, as reported by the entity.\n\n**EstuDAO**\n\n**Value proposition**\n\nIn **Estu.DAO** we have gathered a team of 8 people from different backgrounds who are willing to dedicate countless hours to make this goal a reality. Passion is something inexplicable that brought us together to be part of this crazy group called **Estu.DAO**. - Demencia Mentality.\n\nOur goal is to **build a bridge between traditional Spanish fans & new fans from all over the world**. The team has a deep knowledge of the \"Demencia\" (name of the Club's fan base) & its ecosystem.\n\nEstu.DAO was born from an idea between a group of basketball & cryptocurrency fans who came up with the crazy idea of buying Estudiantes & giving it back to their fans.\n\n\"The dolphins\"; a group of collaborators who help us to coordinate & manage the different work teams.\n\nWe are currently in the process of building our community by implementing a series of actions to grow the community. There are more than 100 people in our Discord channel + 200 on Twitter without any serious media campaigns yet.\n\nIn contact with media personalities + players & explayers who will help us grow in Spain.\n\nPeep our [manifesto](https://twitter.com/Estu_DAO/status/1567600413276250112) made with the community where we express our mission & vision about what we are looking for with the DAO.\n\n**PROPOSAL OF COLLABORATION KRAUSE HOUSE - ESTUDAO**\n\n- Collaboration in the legal aspect for the constitution of EstuDAO with a recognized legal figure that allows it to own physical assets.\n- Integration of EstuDAO into the Krause House Accelerator ecosystem, integration of both communities & commercial exploitation of both br&s in Spanish-speaking markets.\n- Formation of a joint work team for the management & preparation of the offer for the majority purchase of Estudiantes' shares.\n- Fundraising & financing for the confirmation of the investment vehicle for the purchase of a professional basketball club.\n- Br& activations.\n- New monetization avenues for both organizations.\n- KH will be able to test new programs (MyJerry) & have proof that fan ownership model can be successful.\n\n**PROPOSAL FOR MAJORITY PURCHASE OF SHARES IN THE CLUB ESTUDIANTES MOVISTAR**\n\n**STATUS**\n\n![Imagen1.jpg](ipfs://bafkreiczok237hftuuxlopxr43jx6rjan3uajs6injk5trj3k2373b4uxi)\n\n*Information updated at the end of 2021. Liabilities correspond to debt restructurings with public bodies & internal loans.\n \n![Imagen2.jpg](ipfs://bafkreih77nxyocidh3lbxuu64jdvfekmj5wciajeoaefhmpmw634ersqze)\n\n*Annual results\n\n**Proposal for majority purchase of shares of the Estudiantes club.**\n\nFrom Oct 10, 2022 & for one month, the process by which investors can enter the shareholding of the club will be opened. Currently it was approved to increase the share capital by five million euros through the creation of 833,334 new ordinary shares.\n\nIn order to secure the majority share purchase, clean up & pay off the organization's debts, secure the staff's budget for one season & reorganize the structure, a sum of **10 million US dollars**.\n\nEstudiantes has **€4M debt** w/ Spanish government. If the DAO is able to cancel that debt, the **club would be ours**.\n\n**NBA Non-compete clause**\nThe NBA has a non-compete clause stating:\n\n\"The proponents of this proposal recognize that the NBA Constitution and By-Laws (2019) article 3(d) prohibits NBA owner's having interests in teams from other basketball leagues, unless approved by 3/4 of all governors.\"\n\nGiven the mission of Krause House is to buy an NBA team, it is understood that any action or relationship considered under through this proposal or thereafter, will be subject to that restriction.\n\nWe are willing to explore any option available to comply with this clause.\n\n\n**Footnote**\n1) For this proposal, votes will be aggregated for the \"Decline\" options.",

Additionally, Bayesian hosts and produces ‘Around The Association’ and recently completed a 20-episode Season 1 of the podcast where he interviewed a variety of guests including NBA players, coaches, and national media.\n\n---\n\n### Budget Request:\n\nUp to:\n\n- 2.5k $KRAUSE / month\n- 2.5k USDC / month\n\nPaid monthly for 4 months for September through December 2022.\n\nStewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.\n\nCommunity may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.\n\n---\n\n### Funding Strategy + Stream Details:\n\n**Scope of Work**\n\n*A stream request is designed to give contributors freedom and encouragement to work across multiple domains across the DAO; however, here are the current main focuses / intentions:*\n\n### 1) **Krause House Analytics x NBA Pitches**\n\nBayesian Baller will continue working alongside Flex Chapman, Greg, Trik, and the Product Team to perform data science research and build unique NBA analytics projects for prospective NBA partners. The past two months Bayesian has been working on an in-depth analytics project for Krause House’s pitch to the Indiana Pacers to showcase the community’s technical skills and ability to contribute legitimate basketball analysis to the Pacers’ Front Office & Basketball Analytics department.\n\n### 2) Ball Hogs x BIG3 Basketball Analytics\n\nOver the summer, Bayesian Baller spearheaded the basketball analytics initiatives for the Ball Hogs during the 2022 BIG3 season. This included building data-driven scouting reports on a weekly basis for HC Rick Barry and the players to use for game-planning purposes. What started as weekly pre-game scouting reports eventually grew to include post-game reports, as well as, direct conversations with Rick Barry and Ball Hogs players about using analytics to implement actionable in-game strategies. Below are some examples of Bayesian’s work for the Ball Hogs this summer:\n\n- [Week 1 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Killer 3's](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10r3Fh3zGn6BwM2gn9c4SK7Q_HyxCoPac/view?usp=sharing)\n- [Week 2 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Ghost Ballers](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FrvImaWGpwA7-Vwc22pMfYryWBa3doMq/view?usp=sharing)\n- [Week 3 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Triplets](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rqnl7j9ybWFre9cpsK2nxl7uVRa6ohVU/view?usp=sharing)\n- [Week 4 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Tri-State](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KT7K4z_Ld5_fNN7wiFHdKGj9jRRuCHX4/view?usp=sharing)\n- [Week 5 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. Aliens](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GVBbOwzUZbk0fWGhnIJ5LuQ95x5vcNaZ/view?usp=sharing)\n- [Week 6 • BIG3 Scouting Report vs. 3's Company](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-u9UkBi6Ff8Jv5MUnPZMSI6FnCNftpwG/view?usp=sharing)\n\nResponsibilities also included facilitating opportunities with leaders in the sports analytics industry, as well as, laying the foundation for a dedicated basketball strategy and analytics team within Krause House.\n\nClick here to read Bayesian Baller’s plan for the Ball Hogs’ analytics efforts and how we plan to be even more involved going into next season:\n\n- [Krause House x BIG3: Analytics Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YAY9o97L_SPXbiyLezhD116YGbTwonR0VFZtZmO6RxY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n### 3) **Around The Association Podcast**\n\nResearch, record, produce, and market 2-4 podcast episodes per month that drive community engagement, demonstrate the community’s basketball acumen, break down the barrier to entry to get non-crypto fans interested in Web3 / DAOs, and generate ad revenue for the Krause House treasury.\n\n- During Season 1, Bayesian Baller released [20 episodes of Around The Association](https://open.spotify.com/show/3YadlLpwrMTOG0ecvX65bw) and interviewed a variety of guests including NBA players, coaches, and front office members.\n- During Season 2, Bayesian Baller will be getting into more video content and doing in-person video episodes of the podcast.

      "content": "**MyJerry Vibe Check**\n\nAuthors: Mario Lopes#2725, Boosh#8092, Denny#4936, kevtae#0052, Dogstoevsky\n\n**Team:** \n\nMario Lopes#2725 - Core Contributor + Steward at Krause House & Business Development for MyJerry\n\nBoosh#8092 - Core Contributor + Creative Designer for MyJerry (former space systems operational manager; esports and gaming background; cryptocurrency/blockchain involvement since 2013) \n\nDenny#4936 - Full Stack Web/Mobile Developer (co-founded a revenue positive startup, Dype)\n\nkevtae#0052 - Full Stack Web/Mobile Developer (co-founded a revenue positive startup, Dype)\n\nDogstoevsky - Core Contributor + Steward at Krause House & Product Management for MyJerry & Product Team \n\n---\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to get a temperature check from the Krause House community about the [MyJerry](https://app.myjerry.club/) project and if it should continue receiving funding & contributor effort.\nIf the proposal passes, a detailed project budget will follow and will be mapped to milestones.\n\nPlease share your feedback in this discussion thread [https://discord.com/channels/847908414981275648/1025581633073590272](https://discord.com/channels/847908414981275648/1025581633073590272)\n\n---\n\n### What is MyJerry?\n\n**MyJerry** is a social, gamified app for basketball fanatics where digital and IRL engagement is rewarded. It’s more than an Avatar project. Users compete to level up and earn rewards by shooting hoops, socializing in online basketball communities, and completing basketball-related challenges.\n\nTradeable wearables, badges, and digital rewards can be earned through MyJerry, equipped on your PFP avatar and proudly displayed in your profile. Physical rewards like tickets to NBA games, NBA merch, and autographed goods can also be earned by levelling up.\n\nMyJerry brings together basketball players, fans, and future NBA owners from around the world to compete, earn, and have fun with the sport we all love!\n\nWe’d love for you to sign up to create your custom Avatar for free and start playing [https://app.myjerry.club/](https://app.myjerry.club/)\n\nPublic Docs: [https://myjerry.gitbook.io/myjerry/](https://myjerry.gitbook.io/myjerry/)\n\nYoutube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urBOcVFi6MI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urBOcVFi6MI)\n\n*Disclaimer: As this is a beta test, we’d love for you to share feedback through the in-app form to make this the best possible experience for basketball fans around the world!*\n\n### Why we’re making this proposal\n\nWe’re one day into our first small cohort beta test & looking to check the temperature from the Krause House community and see if they value 1) what’s been [built so far](https://app.myjerry.club/) 2) the vision for MyJerry (see milestones & roadmap below)\n\n50 MyJerry Avatars were minted within 1 day of internal beta launch. The purpose of the beta launch is to collect user feedback and iterate upon the product to prep for the public beta launch.\n\n### **Value propositions for Krause House**\n\nKrause House’s Game Plan\n\n[https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/IZm6c5XN58msf_f-UVPmOWLTJfSUwSuB80j8mYjfBZA](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/IZm6c5XN58msf_f-UVPmOWLTJfSUwSuB80j8mYjfBZA)\n\n- As outlined in the Game Plan, we are still in the Credibility Phase and what we’ve realized since building MyJerry is that the system we’ve created is a way to not only track and reward KH community members + onboard hundreds of thousands of basketball fans… but also how it can be used for other sports, brands, communities and organizations.\n- Revenue generation for Krause House through partnership + sponsorship opportunities through a shared revenue model\n- Revenue generation from Web3 activities such as NFT sales, Avatar Sales & Digital Wearables sales\n- Revenue generation from battle pass monetization mechanisms\n- Visible product developed, in-house, by Jerry’s in Krause House; a product we can rally behind and proliferate while building credibility and reputation in the industry\n- Help educate new-to-Web3 users & sports fans through a fun and engaging manner by integrating with Krause House University [https://krausehouseuniversity-frontend.vercel.app/](https://krausehouseuniversity-frontend.vercel.app/) & partnering with reputable Universities/Colleges to deliver a badging program\n- Potential to onboard thousands of users to Krause House, continuing to shape the narrative and pitch of Krause House DAO to the NBA\n- We see it as a really powerful trojan horse to get many more basketball fans & players involved, think STEPN for basketball [https://stepn.com/](https://stepn.com/)\n- A proprietary white-label app that we can bring to an NBA ownership position and leverage as a powerful fan incentivization tool that no other team would have access\n- A foundation for more Krause House members to build Fan Engagement\n\n### Current Opportunities\n\nMyJerry is more than a “PFP” project. It’s a rewards system that can be white labelled for other organizations.\n\n**White Label Prospects**\n\n- In the past two weeks we’ve had several inbound organizations reach out to explore using MyJerry for their needs\n1. [NBN23 / SWISH’s](https://www.nbn23.com/swish/) Web3 department\n    1. SWISH is an app that tracks basketball live stats, results, rankings for organized basketball leagues around the world\n    2. SWISH’s Web3 team is negotiating with the MyJerry to implement the MyJerry Avatars & XP system into it’s app of 300,000 existing users\n        1. KH Benefit: We are currently in discussions for the project as the primary vendor and are negotiating a fee & NFT royalties that MyJerry can return back to the DAO. \n2. [NYU Tisch](https://www.sps.nyu.edu/homepage/academics/divisions-and-departments/preston-robert-tisch-institute-for-global-sport.html) \n    1. KH Member, Smit, who is a top sports management student at NYU shared an opportunity from NYU. It’s in its early phases but if selected as the primary vendor, the MyJerry team would be contracted to build out a white label solution for NYU and collaborate to help revolutionize the entire academic landscape using web3.\n3. [In The Lab](https://hoo.be/inthelab)\n    1. Interested in an easy platform to enter web3, abstract complexity for their large basketball audience and monetize via NIL Avatars, wearables, badges, exclusive content & experiences.\n    2. Krause House would be able to organically onboard In The Labs digital audience\n\n### Milestones & Roadmap\n\n**Q2 2022**\n\n- MyJerry is Founded as side-project\n- Front end development begins\n- Avatar design concepts & ideation begins\n- Experience Point system developed\n\n**Q3 2022** \n\nJuly - Sept\n\n- 1+ billion possible Jerry Avatars based on 1000+ assets developed\n- Smart contract development\n- Back end development\n\nSept - Present (We are here)\n\n- Krause House community Beta launch (Web App)\n- Feedback & learnings are incorporated\n- Applications for Polygons Builder Grants submitted\n- Applications for [The Symmetrical: Grants for Web3 x Consumer Founders](https://mirror.xyz/0x6f2e372cFCaB91f7D3139874790dc5Fb903cB70c/uQKJJCGqyANKonQRFdozUjZ3pgv-uHuIyQHuVHKIakI) submitted\n- Applications for [Boys Club Grants Program](https://boysclub.medium.com/gm-to-the-boys-club-grants-program-bcc87e395769) submitted to help accelerate female adoption of app & also web3\n- Business Development with NBN23/SWISH app, NYU Tisch and other brands, communities & sports teams & organizations\n- Integrate Analytics to Web App\n- Automation of Instant Jerry Points\n- Addition of Jerry Feed - for social proof\n\n**Q4 2022**\n\n- Public Beta launch\n- Focus on Email Notifications + In App for leading users with Rewards\n- Continue Business Development and closing white-label B2B deals with brands, communities & sports organizations\n- Partnership announcements\n- Sign influencers to sell their NIL Avatars & wearables\n- IF, Web App indicates key behaviours & usage, begin Mobile App development (KEY for app notifications)\n- Automation of Avatar creation in Mobile App\n- Introduction of new types of challenges with additional features\n- New Jerry designs and badges\n- Dynamic player & team performance development —> Equip your favorite player/team wearable on game day and earn Jerry Points based on their performance\n- Staking wearables & Jerry Points on games —> Before the game starts, stake your wearables and/or Jerry Points on an outcome against a fellow Jerry.\n\n**Q1 2023 and Beyond**\n\n- Introduction of Jerry Coin (see [https://stepn.com/](https://stepn.com/) for a comparable)\n- Governance via Wearables & Badges\n- Storefront to buy & sell Avatars, Wearables, Badges & Collectibles\n\n# Next Steps\n\nWe believe this is only the beginning of MyJerry.\n\nIf this proposal passes, **Boosh**, **Denny** & **Kevtae** will make submit a team budget proposal to continue the development of MyJerry along with key milestones mapped to the budget.

      "content": "# Expand the Product Team by adding Dogstoevsky#0585\n\n**Author: Dogstoesvky**\n\n**Endorsed by the Product Team**\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nPropose adding Dogstoevsky to the Product Team. Dogstoevsky will support the team and its existing products as needed in domains such as:\n\n- User research\n- Product/project management\n- External outreach\n- Business development\n\n---\n\n### Requested Budget\n\n- 8000 USDC / month\n- 5000 $KRAUSE / month\n- 4 months —> October, November, December, January\n\nThis funding (beyond October) is contingent on the Product Team’s renewal in November.\n\nThere will be a two week trial period where Product Team can ensure good team fit. \n\nStewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.\n\nCommunity may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.\n\n---\n\nDogstoevsky will follow the same operational principles as the existing product team members as outlined [here.](https://www.notion.so/Product-Team-04c0980af80a41e5b9e27dbe8bc6fa48) \n\nDog’s primary focus will be on managing the external engagement and business side of the product team. The goal will be to allow the engineers to stay hyper focused on technical problems while a direct line of communication can still be maintained between the DAO and Product Team (via Dog). \n\nAs part of the product team, Dogstoevsky will still contribute to other areas that are outside of the product team (either in scope or business function), such as finishing the MyJerry BETA and MVP (which is technically a product but outside the product team’s existing initiatives). \n\nDogstoevsky will also continue to participate as a Steward and will be helping several contributors get proposals together as the Contributor Ops Streams are wrapped up. \n\n### Previous Work and Vouching\n\nDogstoevsky worked closely with Greg and Trik over the summer while building the Ball Hogs [rewards program](http://scan.ballhogs.club) and they believe he will work well with them on their product initiatives. \n\n**Previous Work and (POW Journal Updates)** \n\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14xLghaL7CbOL-IkZp-fZaO-NgeqlKsYV](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14xLghaL7CbOL-IkZp-fZaO-NgeqlKsYV)\n\nDogstoevsky has been helping out for about 11 months in Krause House and across a lot of different initiatives. Some of the more recent projects include:\n\n- MyJerry (current)\n- Krause House Consulting (current)\n- Contributor Ops (ending in September)\n- Ball Hogs Rewards Program: app/strategy/logistics\n- Project Management support for projects\n- Onboarding processes and the Agents team\n\nI’ve also provided some lighter support this summer to other projects like:\n\n- Uncle Jon’s IRL Ball Hogs adventures, Krause House University, partnerships, research and development, and more.",

Based on our conversations with teams, visibility into top international markets it a top priority for them.

He has already done 125. Ahead of our pitches towards NBA teams, we want to show that Krause House can have impact in countries around the world by partnering with Mike Swift to build a court in the Philippines. \n\nWe want to design this court specifically themed around an TBA NBA team that we are in contact with and have received approval from their front office to proceed. Based on our conversations with teams, visibility into top international markets it a top priority for them. This would be an effort to expand visibility into one of basketball's biggest market.\n\nWe have a narrow window of time so that we are able to show our efforts during NBA pitches that will start Oct. 10th  \n\nWe are in contact with a few boots on the ground to connect us with local basketball organizations, orphanages, players, etc to help coordinate and put this on\n\nThe high-level framework: \n\n- Partner with Mike Swift to build court\n- Host a youth camp + cash-prize tournament\n- Capture content and edit a 5-minute documentary + small clips\n\nWe want to accomplish all of this from 10/3-10/11\n\nOn top of refurbishing the court, we want to donate merchandising such as either socks, shirts, basketball or shoes to these youth kids \n\nWe’ll need up to two KH representatives on the ground to oversee the project so that we are capturing the necessary moments & things are moving forward. The rest of the team we plan to our curated list of locals native to the Philippines. \n\nThe logistics have been planned around on the limitations in Philippines during October and ready\n\n### Link to Governance Update\nhttps://github.com/Krause-House/org/commit/7d640875c7683a85b46b79429083231201091d44",

      "content": "Investment Opportunities Bounty Project Budget - Up to 10,000 Krause/month for 3 months\n\nAuthor: peterrr#4718\n\n---\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\nBounty budget to create investment research surrounding league opportunities, potential team acquisitions and venture investment.\n\n---\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\nUp to 10,000 Krause/month for 3 months - total 30,000 Krause\n\n### How will funds be used?\n\n- Funds used to incentives bounties\n    - Bounties between 500-1,000 Krause (to be adjusted to meet demand)\n    - Used to incentivize research briefs exploring potential industries, categories or league investments\n    - Bounties posted on Wonderverse.xyz in association with their Gitcoin DEI partnership\n        - Certain bounties will have a “DEI” tag which is allocated for people who identify as a minority\n    - Used to expand the contributor based, and therefore expand our collective intelligence base, for future Krause House Capital investment allocations\n- Funds to be received on the 1st of every month (October 1st, November 1st, December 1st)\n- Compensation from this team will be received from either the Contributor Compensation Team or independent streams\n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\n2/3 multisig managed by peterrr#4718, Lewwwk#4227 and Samuel Thomas | Sthomas1100#3216\n\n---\n\n### Team\n\n- peterrr#4718 with participation from Lewwwk#4227\n\n### Project Details\n\nThe clear value prop of Krause House Capital / DIO is collective intelligence. Collective intelligence enables high quality deal flow from around the world, extremely talented individuals in specialized verticals and the ability to assist portfolio companies with unique and difficult road blocks.\n\nAs Krause looks to implement the strategy voted on in previous soft consensus voting ([https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x97f85099d9e0727fe49f31638e9e42d4148478ace5f88aab5147efc29494fd11](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x97f85099d9e0727fe49f31638e9e42d4148478ace5f88aab5147efc29494fd11)), we need to build a worldwide picture of investment opportunities in both venture and sport. Krause House Capital will look to not only purchase ownership in NBA teams, but purchase ownership in international teams across various leagues, invest in high growth projects shaping the current sports landscape and make venture investments in the future of sports.\n\nTo manage this massive task, we propose to create a bounty project to allow current Krause House members and external contributors to create investment memos for a wide range of categories. Allow individuals to show their expertise and build the collective intelligence of Krause House to assist in investment exploration including international exploration.\n\nThe categories we will look to explore are showed in the following figma:\n\n[https://www.figma.com/file/CtKcIaVg5naKGpW7G7v63S/Investment-Tree-Branch-of-Krause-House-Capital?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/CtKcIaVg5naKGpW7G7v63S/Investment-Tree-Branch-of-Krause-House-Capital?node-id=0%3A1)\n\n**Implementation**\n\nBounty board on [Wonderverse.xyz](http://Wonderverse.xyz) to incentives both internal and external collaboration. Having met with Wonderverse, they have agreed work with us and push our bounties to their community of 17,000 Wonderverse contributors.\n\nWill return all funds not used.\n\nInvestment memos will be heavily vetted by peterrr#4718 through a structured grading process. The investment memos will all follow a uniform structure to allow the research to be able to show relative value between investment categories. This is to ensure consistency and accuracy while maximizing decentralized intelligence.\n\n**Expectations of Research Briefs**\n\nPoints outlined below will give a clear idea of what KH is to receive through the collection of research briefs\n\n- Rating of relative indicators within investment category to create relative evaluation of investment potential between verticals, while quantitative results will allow comparison across categories, qualitative analysis will provide the context necessary when an opportunity is presented.\n- Venture topics to be evaluated: innovation level; technical difficulty; connection to adjacent technologies; availability of opportunities; risk factors, economic overview; scope related to changing lives\n- League topics to be evaluated: value drivers; risk factors; leagues relative strength; financial strength; key drivers of success for teams\n- Team topics to be evaluated: value drivers; risk factors; team relative strength within league; financial strength; key drivers of success; fandom\n\n**Indicators of Success**\n\n- Expand Krause and DIO contributor base internationally\n- Build investment opportunity wiki for future Krause House Capital investment explorations\n- Receive high quality research from people world wide to better understand investment opportunities in sport and venture\n- Support DEI groups though working with Gitcoin partners and promote Krause as a brand support DEI efforts in Web3\n\n## Link to Governance\n\n[https://github.com/Krause-House/org/commit/ac041410de3b8b66734e388ac9799dc1f8e533d8](https://github.com/Krause-House/org/commit/ac041410de3b8b66734e388ac9799dc1f8e533d8)",

      "title": "Uncle Jon & The Pig Pen Podcast",
      "content": "Author: Uncle Jon\n\n---\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\nCreate a 1-season podcast series (~10 ep) telling Krause House & the Ball Hog’s journey through Uncle Jon’s story. With the intention of giving us a high quality example of a decentralized fan generated content that a DAO can deliver upon in our NBA minority ownership pitches. \n\n---\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\n- $10k USDC\n    - $4k USDC up-front\n    - $6k USDC upon delivery of finished product\n\n### How will funds be used?\n\n- 100% to Uncle Jon (Team Lead)\n    - For the time recording his journey\n    - For all recordings & work done under this project\n    - For producing / editing\n    - Note: Uncle Jon fully retains the rights to his story, KH will buy the audio rights\n    - Note: Uncle Jon retains artistic veto rights for the podcast\n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\n- Funding to `0x2D5803Cb5Cb2Bd90eb242e0162AE5E25B7a31b39`\n\n---\n\n### Team\n\n- Commodore & Uncle Jon (Producers)\n\n## Trailer\n\n[Uncle & The Pig Pen (KH Cut).wav](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dUIjlCXdOn_nmgiHLFFU29v5YZio4nj2/view?usp=sharing)\n\n### Project Details\n\nThe idea is to tell Krause House & the Ball Hog’s unique story, through one of our most unique & interesting Jerrys: Uncle Jon. Uncle Jon has a unique path through our DAO & incredible stories of working closely on the ground at the BIG3 games. We’d like to explore:\n\n- The life of Uncle Jon\n- How he became Uncle Jon\n- Krause House’s influence on utilizing his passion\n- The stories of the Ball Hogs\n- Behind the scenes at the BIG3\n- The ups & downs of Uncle Jon’s life to how he got here\n- What happens next?\n\nWe think that using long form audio is an excellent medium to experiment with web3 storytelling. During our pitch with one particular NBA team, the idea of having a decentralized community help deliver fan generated content was an exciting prospect. This podcast would provide us a decentralized fan generated content example in our pitches to NBA teams. Additionally, there’s a realistic chance that this podcast is generally well loved broadly — this is why we choose Uncle Jon + telling our story.\n\nWe feel that Uncle Jon is a unique enough character to use as a vehicle to highlight the value of Krause House & our asset the Ball Hogs. We think this is a superior strategy than simply doing a podcast outlining what Krause House & the Ball Hogs is.\n\nThe creative vision is something akin to The Last Dance detailing a biographical.\n\nFurther production begins as soon as proposal is passed.\n\n### Link to Governance update\nhttps://github.com/Krause-House/org/commit/523e60eb5e0277d526553b5d5e83466664176bd1\n",

      "content": "**Lewwwk Contributor Funding Request**\n\n**Author: Lewwwk#4227**\n\n---\n\n**Recipient:** Lewwwk#4227\n\n**Wallet:** 0xAEa967842976600f1a9256DcA207E4435A6f0112\n\n**Request:**\n\n- 7,500 $KRAUSE / month\n- 7,500 USDC / month\n\nPaid monthly, at the end of each month, for September, October, and November 2022.\n\n**Protections:**\n\n- Stewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.\n- Community may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.\n\n---\n\n**### Scope of Work**\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of the work initiated under the [previous Capital Coordination proposal that concluded August 31st, 2022](https://www.notion.so/Contributor-Funding-Request-Capital-Coordination-4ede742413f04678a27bbd071e1bd3de). The scope of work for this includes up to 3 days per week, or 12 days per month by Lewwwk#4227 focused on:\n\n- Raising Fund I including necessary structures, partnerships, agreements and proposals.\n- Supporting team acquisitions including capital, strategy, and structuring.\n\n---\n\n**### Results from Previous Work**\n\nThrough work completed under the previous proposal, Lewwwk, in collaboration with Commodore and Flex, successfully established the capacity for Krause House to secure the capital required to take a minority ownership position in an NBA team. \n\n**WAGBAT!** → [Loom Video on Fund I](https://www.loom.com/share/b4d3c4d1206a40ca8b9bce74249f71c5)\n\nIn addition, a scalable, compliant capital structure and roadmap has been developed that will enable Krause House to make team acquisitions, advance fan ownership and participation, invest in sports innovation, and progressively decentralize ownership. The first component of that roadmap, a $100M acquisition and investment fund has been also be validated as an attractive and differentiated offering to capital allocators who invest in sports.\n\n(To learn more, please reach out in #dio-chat)\n\n### Divergence from Previously Intended Outcomes\n\n- Early on in the previous work, effort shifted from higher-volume outreach to collaborating with a few key individuals with deep experience in sports investment and transformation. As a result CRM and contact metrics were deprioritized.\n- While we have not secured specific capital commitments, we can confirm meaningful interest in a Krause House treasury diversification round, the inclusion of the venture strategy in Fund I as described above, and the capacity to secure the capital required to take a minority ownership position in an NBA team.\n\n**### What Does Success Look Like**\n\nOutreach to LPs around Fund I is now in process and we stand ready to raise the capital necessary to complete an acquisition in an NBA team that comes available to us. \n\nSuccess for this phase of Capital Coordination could look like:\n\n- LOI and capital secured for a minority ownership position in an NBA team.\n- First close on Fund I > $20mm\n- First fees from Fund I land in Krause House Treasury by end of year.\n\n<aside>\n⚠️ Market sentiment continues to be bearish with significant macro uncertainties looming that are beyond our control. While sports remains an attractive investment and we have designed for compliance with existing regulations and practice… outcomes continue to have heightened uncertainties.\n\n</aside>\n\n### Link to KH Governance update\n\nhttps://github.com/Krause-House/org/commit/0920411ddab835a0da6ac3efa63912a1c39fdc58",

      "content": "**Author:** SuperBenefit and the Krause House Purpose and Values Team\n\n---\n\n### Overview\n\nBuilding on the updated [Krause House Game Plan](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x97f85099d9e0727fe49f31638e9e42d4148478ace5f88aab5147efc29494fd11), this project proposes a collaboration to establish a shared vision of the future of sport, and a roadmap for getting there.\n\nIt will result in one or more visual (with text) outputs that summarize a shared understanding of:\n\n- sport and the ecosystem around it,\n- how it is changing,\n- how we’d like it to be, and\n- where effort is best invested to bring those changes about.\n\nFor Krause House, this will be valuable in the following ways:\n\n- help Jerrys evaluate and direct resources toward high-value activities\n- help Krause House Capital develop community aligned investment strategies\n- build awareness and demonstrate leadership for Krause House across the broader sports ecosystem.\n\nAs a token swap with [SuperBenefit](https://superbenefit.org), this project will:\n\n- Signal community alignment with SuperBenefit and open doors for future collaboration.\n- Provide Krause House governance influence over SuperBenefit's direction and research and initiatives into creating better futures through decentralization.\n- Resource the development of a vision and roadmap for the future of sport as imagined by Jerry's and the Krause House ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n### Proposal Specification\n\n15,000 $KRAUSE is being requested, to be allocated as follows:\n\n- Internal: 5,000 $KRAUSE to the Purpose and Values team for overseeing the project and recognizing participants.\n- Token Swap: 10,000 $KRAUSE to SuperBenefit (0x731c837121C15e1e7e3cfc0E2588f4d0B35FdD48), in exchange for 20,000 $SPRB, the SuperBenefit governance token to be received at (0xE4762eAcEbDb7585D32079fdcbA5Bb94eb5d76F2).\n- SuperBenefit will further incentivize project participation in the SuperBenefit community as needed with an additional 10,000 $SPRB.\n\nAfter completion the community will have the option to make an additional swap based on results of this project and/or to encourage further collaboration. The following options will be presented:\n\n- No additional swap\n- 10,000 $KRAUSE for 20,000 $SPRB\n\nFor reference:\n\n- SuperBenefit’s token swap proposal is on snapshot at:\n    \n    [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/superbenefit.eth/proposal/0x2301700340ba5308ae61346ce43ac4d22ab853b9f53603e7a3da050b3f11adbd)\n    \n- [$SPRB](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfC3Ac26D9A4A00B2534298c933A84F54430B3850#balances), SuperBenefit’s governance token has a fixed supply of 10,000,000 (with [2,000,000 bridged to Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/token/0xDaC5f23D2890A1129a3Fc6416b292A0ca82D3ccc#balances)), and has no value.\n- A ratio of  1:2 ($KRAUSE : $SPRB) was used to determine swap ratio using the principle of each DAO having equal governance influence over the other as a result of this token swap.\n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\nThe Purpose and Values team will oversee this project and the project allocation of 5,000 $KRAUSE. \n\nThe SuperBenefit team will report in to the Purpose and Values team and oversee their own team and internal allocation of 10,000 $SPRB.\n\nToken swaps (10,000 $KRAUSE to SuperBenefit, 20,000 $SPRB to Krause House) will be sent to each community’s treasury upon commencement of this project and will be managed as each receiving community decides.\n\n---\n\n### Team\n\n- Krause House Purpose and Values Team\n    - Project lead: SilkeyJ - SilkeyJ is the former Director of Operations at SeedClub and has experience in project management, systems mapping, and organizational logic models and theories of change.\n- SuperBenefit\n    - Project lead: AlexH - Alex is a Professor of Practice and Co-Lead of the [Yunus Centre at Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/griffith-business-school/yunus-centre) and is the Lead Author on numerous works on systems innovation, design, and capital. (e.g. [https://medium.com/y-impact/creating-intentional-futures-aaa4cd2571e9](https://medium.com/y-impact/creating-intentional-futures-aaa4cd2571e9))\n    - Note: Lewwwk is a co-creator of SuperBenefit and $SPRB token-holder. He will abstain from voting on this proposal.\n\n### Project Details\n\nThe sports industry and experience is undergoing a major transformation, and Krause House is at the epicentre. While our mission is clearly focused on buying and managing an NBA team, our broader influence and opportunity is becoming apparent.\n\nVisualizing and navigating systemic transformations is both opportunity rich and challenging. This is where [SuperBenefit](http://superbenefit.org/) comes in.\n\n**About SuperBenefit**\n\n[SuperBenefit's mission](http://superbenefit.mirror.xyz/) is to develop the social and financial flywheels that enable invention and acceleration of a better world. This includes strengthening capacities for systems innovation and supporting people to clarify pathways towards shared goals.\n\n**Proposed Process**\n\nWorking together with Krause House, SuperBenefit proposes to lead a process through the following phases over 5-8 weeks.\n\n1. **Framing:** working with core, stewards, team leads, and select advisors to introduce the intended approach, its purpose, and its potential future uses.\n2. **Visioning**: working sessions and open invitations to imagine desirable and possible futures for professional sport. Synthesis to shape a compelling vision and directional goals. Includes a working session and two iterations.\n3. **Mapping transition challenges and pathways:** surfacing the systemic fields of action needed to create transitions from current to future states. Includes a working session, two iterations, incorporating the vision and publishing as a high-level ‘Transformation Map’.\n4. **Crowdsourcing activity across ‘map’:** crowdsourcing actions and innovations being undertaken around the world that have alignment with the intention and orientation of the map.\n\n**Review**\n\nSuperBenefit and Krause House’s ‘Purpose and Values’ team to review the process, its effect, and determine options for further activities.\n\n### Link to Governance Update\nhttps://github.com/Krause-House/org/tree/42229aa47e776c6478e416aad80dfeaf81731ae7",

It it passes, the Multisig will update the ENS field to that URI.\n\n**Note**: That URI ***must*** point to a resource that cannot be changed after the fact (ex: github commit, IPFS) or it should be rejected by the Multisig.\n\n### Reversibility\n\nThe tokenholders have the explicit power to revert the governance structure to the prior model or to an improved iteration. \n\n### Footnotes\n\n1. Please check out the proposed governance state [here](https://github.com/Krause-House/org/tree/fce91f81f34f16b8f462f91dad56064e60a56ee5).\n2. Given that all tokens are technically eligible for voting, there is no explicit permission or norm in this governance proposal that restricts a token’s voting rights based on it’s acquisition source (earned, purchased, or airdropped). In simpler terms, all tokens are eligible for voting.\n3. For this proposal, votes will be aggregated for the \"Decline\" options. ",

      "title": "[Multiple Choice: Publish on Mirror + Sentiment] Krause House’s Game Plan",
      "content": "This is a poll to get community permission to publish on Mirror & sentiment on Krause House's next phase of strategy. If approved, a follow up proposal with more specific action items will be deployed.\n\n---\n\n# Krause House’s Game Plan\n\nPurchasing a minority share of a NBA team remains our ultimate short-term goal, we believe if we can accomplish this our ability to grow our treasury materially improves. This process takes time, introductions, networking, pitching, & more to get a deal done. We’ve made significant progress on this front, but until we can announce we’ve secured a position — we won’t be giving out any high fives or pats on the back for our efforts.\n\nIt’s been nearly a year since we showcased our initial Flightpaper, we’ve been putting in work on our Credibility phase. We’ve bought a BIG3 team, built the world’s first NFT basketball court at NFT.NYC, & designed novel financial structures to have a DAO sit on a cap table of professional sports teams — yet it’s still just the 1st quarter.\n\n## Where We’ve Been\n\n### **BIG3**\n\nOwning a BIG3 team in the [Ball Hogs](https://www.ballhogs.club/) has allowed us to experiment with fan access & fan engagement. Captained by Jerry Uncle Jon we’ve delivered by far the most fun seating section inside at BIG3 games. Our top community members have been able to earn access to courtside tickets & a VIP experience for our team’s games. We even tapped our community for [best-in-class scouting](https://twitter.com/BIG3_BallHogs/status/1543353209108025346) + analytics for our team & opponents. Building grassroots community in multiple cities has provided deep learnings in fan engagement that inform how we build out our playbook for working with future teams. \n\n![ballhogs.png](ipfs://bafkreidlkhmtmjdbzx77h6457ivksaikdxoklczeva4xnzgl257mxfzq6u)\n\n### **NFT.NYC**\n\nThe magic of a self-organizing DAO was in full display — 8 Jerrys with event planning experience came together to throw the best event at NFT.NYC. We hosted premier 3x3 ballers on top of our world’s first NFT basketball court. The KH Jam basketball court was designed by incredible artists and was *both* a digital NFT & physical piece of art. \n\n \n![289676359_395308709238451_6438781895618470422_n.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeibvifhvyz2kt3wjyxxeba6pqwwfwjrhquaplhjgwpcd5vergn3mai)\n\n[https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1545141263309078531](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1545141263309078531)\n\nWe delivered a 🔥 IRL event, debuted a new way to crowdfund physical assets, and brought basketball x web3 together. This is just the beginning of Krause House exerting itself into the physical world, look for KH collaborating with incredible brands all around the world. \n\n### **Novel Financial Structures**\n\nOver the last 9 months we’ve been hard at work developing a novel legal structure that meets the needs of both the NBA and KH Jerry’s. We think we have a solution — this will most likely require several separate legal structures via a sub-DAO model to hold any equity. These entities will be made up of “Jerrys” & will be in full compliance with the league + local jurisdiction’s rules. It will depend on each actual position, but the strategy is that governance & access continues to be delegated upwards to $KRAUSE & NFT holders to involve our core broad community.\n\nUsing a sub-DAO model only accessible to NFT holders (Jerrys) is one component of our novel approach. We don’t want to give away our “secret sauce” here, but the high-level context is that the NBA recently approved private equity firms to own equity within NBA teams which allows for new interest groups to become minority owners in an NBA franchise. There are novel legal, operational, & financial vehicles to interact with DAOs. Krause House is sitting at the forefront of this behemoth effort that will continue to evolve over time. There will not be a single “fits-all-sizes” solution to our journey — we’ll build evolving solutions together. \n\nUltimately these innovations are composable fan participation and ownership as a protocol. The ability to generate derivatives, social staking, & NFT-based ownership will serve as foundational features of a protocol empowering equity, access, & governance. \n\n## **Where We’re Heading**\n\nThe idea that is Krause House *will* happen, it’s just a matter of when. Yet we have a limited amount of treasury to bring this idea into reality. As crypto navigates a bear market & we work against a shortening runway, we need to make tough prioritization choices to bring the vision to reality. We’ll be looking to scale back expenditures that are not core to our first major milestone — acquiring a NBA minority position.\n\nWe believe if we can successfully acquire a NBA minority position, the ability to generate revenue and/or do a treasury diversification materially improves. Additionally, we’ve invented a new capital structure to work with to accomplish the many (and often competing needs) of our situation. We’re calling this entity: KH Capital.\n\nWhen most people hear the word “ownership” they imply 3 things rolled into one:\n\n- Equity\n- Governance\n- Access\n\nA traditional “owner” has equity in the team, control via governance, & access to owner experiences. Krause House is deconstructing & remixing these 3 concepts for sports. A common misconception about our mission is that it would be chaos to have 5,000 members telling a team what to do. We fundamentally believe in a participatory governance model to influence decision making & access to a professional team. \n\nWhat KH Capital empowers us to do is to bring in capital at a scale (8 figures+) that believes in Krause House’s mission & community. This gives us negotiating legitimacy & leverage to secure positions within professional sports teams around the world. Jerrys would be able to participate in a portfolio of teams and/or invest in positions where they are eligible to (meeting league + regulatory requirements).\n \n![KH Capital.png](ipfs://bafkreibvrfyfhkc25bv6gdkoxjpqgwa2apv652vwdujhslisetyrxtmccy)\n    \nIn minority ownership positions, partnering with the *right* teams is paramount. Delegated governance & access to interesting functions of a team can then be extended to the Krause House community. \n\nInternational basketball opportunities thus far have been less aligned with our mission than expected due to shaky business fundamentals for all leagues outside of the NBA. We’re learning that our approach to bringing value to NBA positions applies equally to all professional sports. Soccer has emerged as an interesting space for us to build credibility. Not all of our Jerrys are into soccer, but many are and the insights from ownership within the sport are applicable to KH’s credibility phase. We’re not officially committing to adding soccer to our portfolio, but we continue to explore high quality ownership stakes that align with our mission & phase of our roadmap (credibility). It should be noted that European & Asian leagues continue to be on our horizon, but we need to focus on teams that are running better than breakeven + have a real path to general management influence. \n\n## The Future\n\nKrause House is the best minority owner a NBA team could have. From PhD level data scientists that are ready to assist front office analytics teams to a worldwide community that will serve as a supplemental scouting network. Krause House is a dynamically talented community that can ebb & flow with the needs of a NBA team — that’s the beauty of a community. \n\nWe’re no longer just a game plan. It’s the first quarter, we’re playing well — we’ve got a lead. The second quarter game plan is to acquire a NBA minority position. This goal is within our reach, there is a path to accomplishing it. We need to stay focused & close out the first half with a big lead. Let’s give it everything we’ve got — WAGBAT!",

      "title": "Contributor Funding Request - Defining Fan Ownership (GladRobot)",
      "content": "Author: GladRobot#6845\n\n**Amount Requested:**\n20,000 $KRAUSE / month\n\n**Duration**\n4 months (Start Date Aug 22nd)\n\n**Compensation Context**  \nThe Stewards have signaled we reduce spending to protect the runway of KH Treasury holdings of USDC+ETH. This funding request preserves our runway while signaling alignment with the goals of the DAO.\n\nIf GladRobot joins another contributor stream he’ll reduce or close this contributor stream to avoid increasing his net compensation. \n\n**Protections**\n\n- Stewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.\n- Community may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.\n\n**ELI5 - Explain like I’m 5**\n\nWe all want to own a team but what does that exactly mean to Jerry’s, Fans, Investors and Teams? This proposal intends to deliver how Krause House will define the value exchange value between all parties. Having a crystal clear product offering is paramount in being able to raise capital, acquire team stakes and activate a global fanbase.\n\n**Scope of Work**\n\nGladRobot will work full time (40+ hrs/wk) to craft and deliver the means by which Krause House will deliver fan ownership to pro sports teams. He will work closely with the core team, stewards and the International League Exploration team to:\n\n- Define what Fan Ownership means at Krause House\n- Delivering theory, execution steps and presentation materials on the value offer of fan ownership from Krause House to partners (Investors, Team Owners and Leagues)\n- Assisting early stage discussions with Krause House members around acquisitions\n- Due diligence on potential acquisitions - Assuring we have sufficient information to make prudent decisions.\n- Assisting the Capital team led by Lewwwk on capital raises and investments\n\n**Oversight**\n\n- All work will be recorded in a public Google Doc\n- Initial drafts will be shared through Krause House Discord\n- Core team and Stewards engaged with acquisitions can monitor progress through weekly updates to ensure quality work is being delivered in line with this proposal and Krause House’s needs.\n\n**Goals**\n\n- Define what fan ownership means at KH. This is a topic that is currently foggy at best and needs a crystal clear delivery.\n- Define our value add offer as part of minority position.\n- Each novel concept becomes its own topic for Jerry’s shape into a final form.\n\n**What Does Success Look Like**\n\n- Novel concepts like Fan Polling are created and shared with the DAO for iterative improvements\n- Constructing complete plans for Fan Ownership\n- Revising approaches based on feedback from the DAO and partners\n- Raising capital based on the executional theory that complements the financial and business plan\n- Attaining a Letter of Intent from an NBA franchise and/or top tier international league franchise\n\n(!) Given the timing of achieving all of the above may be dependent upon 3rd parties, at a minimum we should be positioned with a clear strategy that the DAO and partners express conviction in.\n\n**Previous Work**\n\n- [Flightpaper](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/uLSxAa96TUOzcGo4JKh3sK-tR6y1cLEN6R4iWPuL7P4)\n- [NOLA 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vFqzHJaaJusrZdXxnucgUjTbfKGGrWQ0v8SjrRkGytw/edit) - Good for the Pelicans (Team value accrues to charities)\n- [NOLA 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hb_NxtQEHskSlq3CFcNCgOeuRVhBiZEdyjPf7k6NWFc/edit#) - Make the Pelicans a Fan Controlled Team\n\n**Involvement with Krause House**\n\nAn early contributor always focused on ‘how’ we WAGBAT starting with [Establishing Belief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O0cJ22o5spUpYUbAYHU4nMy8203sS0jmLDJcOf0WBsI/edit) from June 2021. GladRobot has looked at multiple paths to ownership; ‘[Buying the New Orleans Pelicans through charitable acts](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4M4zLfgcNjIaJvu1ZWS2ib?si=zRNCwi5fS-O3pMM-29ADOg)’, revenue generating protocols and membership clubs. Currently, Glad serves as a Krause House Steward who broadly helps Jerry’s to crystalize their contributions.\n\n**Relevant Personal Background**\n\n- Oakland A’s / Minor league affiliate Vancouver Canadians Short season single A - Director of Media and Community Relations.\n- University of Connecticut - Statistics & Media Relations for 3 years (1997-2000) across Men’s and Women’s Basketball, Soccer and Football (lots of National Championships).\n- Nike - Produced social product innovation across Nike Running, Nike Basketball and Nike FuelBand.\n- 8x Startup founder",

Krause House will be seen as a strong partner.\n- The Web3 environment is to create and to handle : freedom of creation, execution and revenues implementation. This area of action will position KH as a key partner, experience that will help have more impact and credibility for the all DAO, for next projects.\n- As a board member, Krause House will also have power of decision, look on basketball operations and management impact (business & choices regarding development)\n- Unique TV Rights and Streaming revenue opportunities in Europe\n- Many partners of the club could be interested in partnership with Krause House\n\n**CONTEXT**\n\nElan Béarnais - Pau Orthez have a new owner.\n\nCounterpointe group have sold their shares : they have not demonstrate their ability to invest in and manage a pro team.\n\nA french entrepreneur is now the majority owner of the team, which means three good things :\n\n- Pau stay in first division Betclic Elite.\n- The treasury is funded and will be 4.7 millions for the year.\n- The city of Pau has resumed it subvention of 1.2 millions per year and former french minister Didier Guillaume, is part of the journey.\n\nThe new owner offers us a way to invest 100k for 5% of the majority stake (72%).\n\nIn exchange, KH will have a seat at the team board and be part of the basketball operations.\n\nWe will have also the ability to influence their marketing operations, drive the web3 tools and politics of the team.\n \n![IMG-0174.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreihm2nc26mlphofovx3d6monefi45x44crvvsozmnqfvoqk5kieebu)\n    \n**KRAUSE HOUSE ACQUISITIONS AND AREAS TO OPERATE**\n\n- [ ]  **Administration** : one seat at the board (total capital : 5%)\n- [ ]  **Basketball Operations** : participation in the daily basketball operations\n- [ ]  **Marketing and Fan Engagement** : generated and animated Web3 tools (NFTs campaign, discord community, fan token discussions and vote, metaverse experiences, education)\n- [ ]  **Exposure** : KH displays onsite-online, perks to animate the KH community in France and Europe.\n\n**KRAUSE HOUSE REVENUES SOURCES**\n\n- [ ]  Fan Token Sales\n- [ ]  NFT sales\n- [ ]  NFT game ticket sales\n- [ ]  Merchandising (KH x Elan Bearnais collection)\n- [ ]  % of profits based on % of capital owned\n\nRevenues and ownership will be managed by KH International SubDAO.\n\n**KRAUSE HOUSE HUMAN & TECH RESOURCES**\n\n- [ ]  1 KH Representative : Board seat and Daily operations @Giovanese\n- [ ]  1 Fan Experience Manager @paul\n- [ ]  Tech assistance (Blockchain assistance NFTs, Fan Token)\n- [ ]  KH technical team : @boosh @mariolopez\n- [ ]  Legal assistance @MDLawyer + French law firm\n- [ ]  International Commitee or SubDAO assistance : European and international PR, attract non-french audience, build an international community around the team.\n\n**BUDGET**\n\n180,000 to 190,000 USDC\n\n10,000 $KRAUSE\n\n*Budget Breakdown*\n\n- [ ]  **Capital acquisition** : 103,000 USDC\n- [ ]  **KH Representative** : 40,000 USDC / season, paid monthly + up to 5,000 USDC envelope for representation costs (gas, travel, food) reimbursed on proof of expenses.\n- [ ]  **Fan Experience Manager** : 25,000 USDC / season, paid monthly + up to 3,000 USDC for representation costs (gas, travel, food) reimbursed on proof of expenses.\n- [ ]  **Technical Assistance** : 10,000 USDC or Krause House product team\n- [ ]  **Legal Assistance** : 2,000 USDC (MDLawyer) + 2,000 USDC for French Assistance.\n- [ ]  **International committee assistance** : 10,000 $KRAUSE\n\n**GOVERNANCE** \n\nDaily links with the Krause House Stewards \n\nWeekly meetup-call with the Krause House Stewards \n\n@EdgyBrah as a reference, will be our International steward at a daily base, as a reference.\n\nA pool will be created to be part of the main decisions process (international committee and stewards)\n\n**ALSO**\n\n**We are negotiating an extra percentage of the capital (2-5%) to handle the fan experience process and the web3 tools deployment. So the entire deal could be 10% of the club.**\n\n400 fans have invested in the fan token sales. For now, Elan Bearnais sees us as the best option to handle this community.  \n\nIt means that we will offer them 400 KH X PAU NFTs to enter in the SubDAO community and compensate their lost.\n\nPerks will be given by the team (free seats, merchandising, Q/A with players…etc)\n\nApart from that, in early 2023, the second phase will be launched. We’ll give to the SubDAO community the right to vote on minor decisions about the team (Logo, Jerseys, Activations, Spécial Events, PR tools…).\n\n![IMG_0176.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreig44awonbfvh63cy6lyur5yldw4e5i44zlh65lign3kaf3s7zu3p4)\n\nOur goal is to educate people on the first year and launch a paid Nfts next year or sooner to build a more important treasury.\n\nIncreasing our treasury will have three main advantages : \n\n1. Possibility to increase our stake and so our power in the team.\n2. Implementation of the Krause House fan ownership model.\n3. Increase our financial legacy through more stake.",

      "title": "Gitcoin DEI Grant Program Sponsorship and Participation Proposal",
      "content": "**Intention**\n\nDiversity and inclusion is important to Krause House, the NBA ([example](https://pr.nba.com/basketball-africa-league-gender-equality-initiatives/)), sponsors (e.g. [Nike](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a39464890/nike-think-tank-women-athletes-equality-sports-simone-manuel/)), and the future of sport. \n\nThe upcoming Gitcoin DEI grant round (see [last round as example](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-to-advance-dei-in-web3/)) presents a great opportunity for Krause House to both demonstrate our commitment and take action. Due to the short timeline for the launch of the grant program, this proposal combines both the sponsorship donation (signalling Krause House commitment to DEI) and the development of grant submission ideas (representing Krause House leadership and action) into a single project. \n\n**Context**\n\nSport can change lives, and brings benefits to people and communities around the world. Those benefits will be greatest when all people regardless of gender, racialization, or socio-economic background are welcome and able to participate.\n\nKrause House is positioning itself as the leader in decentralizing sport and creating ownership opportunities for fans globally. Krause House operates as a DAO, which at its core represents an egalitarian form of governance and structure, and was founded on the vision that team ownership shouldn’t be limited to a handful of billionaires, but rather that **all** fans of every professional franchise can collectively have real ownership. The intent of this vision is inclusivity across all forms of diversity.\n\nTo help bring that reality forward and further establish Krause House’s leadership position and commitment that all fans should have ownership opportunity, we are requesting a budget to sponsor the upcoming Gitcoin DEI (Diversity, Equality, Inclusion) grant round, and organize the submission of one more more proposals. \n\n**Requested Budget**\n\n20,000 $USDC and 20,000 $KRAUSE\n\n**How Will Funds Be Used**\n\n1. **Gitcoin Grant ($20,000 USDC)**: Krause House will grant 20,000 $USDC to Gitcoin as a matching partner for the upcoming DEI Grant Stream (to be announced in the coming weeks). See [example of previous DEI grant round](https://gitcoin.co/blog/gitcoin-grants-to-advance-dei-in-web3/).\n2. **Jerry Grant Submission Support (20,000 $KRAUSE)**: The Purpose and Values team will coordinate one or more proposal submissions to the same grant round. 5,000 $KRAUSE will be distributed to the Purpose and Values team for coordinating the proposals, while 15,000 $KRAUSE will be available to Jerrys for proposal development and implementation. \n\nIt is anticipated that Jerry’s will submit proposals to the grant round that could raise in excess of $20,000 USDC for their projects. \n\n**Examples of proposal ideas that Jerry’s might submit to the Gitcoin DEI Grants Round include:**\n\n- **Krause House and the WNBA:** Bring the Krause House community building experience to a WNBA team to build engagement and pave a path toward community ownership.\n- **Women and Sport Community Trust:** creating a nouns-style community trust to establish perpetual, self-directed granting program to advance gender and inclusion in sport.\n\n**How Will the Project Be Managed**\n\nProposal ideas will be solicited from the community via submission form announced in discord and townhall. Ideas will be shortlisted by the Purpose and Values team based on the following criteria:\n\n- **Alignment** - with Krause House values, vision, and strategic direction.\n- **Actionability** - likelihood that the idea could be executed well by Jerrys.\n- **Potential Impact** - potential for the project to lead to meaningful equity and inclusion outcomes in sport and/or web3.\n\nThe Purpose and Values team will then be available in an advisory capacity to the authors of shortlisted projects as they develop their Gitcoin proposals. If successful, support will continue to be available through monthly-checkins over the course of the project.\n\nProposals may request allocations from the 15,000 $KRAUSE budget, and must be approved by the Purpose and Values team before submission to Gitcoin if they reference Krause House, engage Jerrys, or have requested a $KRAUSE budget allocation. The Purpose and Values team will use 3/5 consensus on all proposal decisions.\n\n**How Will Funds Be Managed**\n\nThe Purpose and Values team will submit transaction requests to treasury as required to implement the project. \n\nAny resulting grant awards from successful projects will returned to the treasury and remain available to the proposal teams according to the terms of their successful proposal and as otherwise stipulated by the Purpose and Values team.\n\n**Team**\n\nTo date the Purpose and Values team has launched the [#Iggy-Awards](https://pitch.com/public/3396a880-e40e-4cc0-87c5-5fcb20454ead), conducted a [baseline survey](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gmxeMNA9Z6g-s53eyTLAuv6GkChmwaYYAZXhKDyE-BI/edit) on Krause House’s purpose and values, and is in process of completing the first full review as outlined in our [original proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x268f9f718e46c3c20f5c5395bcaa868e2b909eee0e105caf31bcf73365ab8687). The team (@TimothE, @dluxe, @silekyj, @eli, @Lewwwk) will coordinate the delivery of the project as required.",

      "content": "**Team**\n- This proposal is led by Kojiro (@kojirohirate) and Julia (@julia) of Joyfa.\n\n### Proposal\n- Approve the use of Ball Hogs branding for the following NFT collection.\n- Final Design must be approved via another Snapshot vote.\n- Split 50% of gross margin (Sales - gas - marketplace fee) to Krause House's treasury.\n\n**Contexts**\n\nWe all agree that sneakers have been a cornerstone of basketball culture. Air Jordan, LeBron, Curry Flow... You name it. We purchase sneakers of our favorite players, wear them on the streets, brag about having them to our friends, and make them part of our identity. In other words, sneakers have deepened the relationship between players and fans.\n\nAlso, as we move toward the Web3 era, the idea of self-expression in the digital space is gaining more popularity. According to recent research by Business of Fashion, more than 50% of the US general population wants to purchase digital items in the last 12 months as a new way to enjoy fashion.\n\nI believe ownership of digital sneaker NFTs will be a new way for the young generation to build a relationship with players and teams. As the first step, I propose to create a one of a kind Ball Hogs-themed digital sneaker NFTs and sell them on OpenSea.\n\nThe owners will be able to display their sneakers on the AR App that my company, Joyfa is releasing. The community will also be able to showcase their digital sneakers on a metaverse-based sneaker rack Joyfa will launch next year.\n\nSneaker Sketch --> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wnY-_-FXowqQQ01uENT4iXG7YI-mSMou/view?usp=sharing\n\nAR App Demo --> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TUo5nm9tzD4d0YAFQ6vtgF88EgCAgp8x/view?usp=sharing\n\n**Scope of Work**\n\n*Joyfa*\n\n- Design 3D digital sneakers under Ball Hog's branding\n- Issue the sneakers as NFTs\n\n*Krause House*\n\n- Approve the use of Krause House and/or Ball Hogs branding\n- Approve the design of the sneakers - Community Voting\n- Marketing and promotional collaboration pre launch of the NFTs - Media Team\n- Support user acquisition by sharing the sales info on its social media and Discord - Media Team\n- OPTIONAL: KH to display Digital Sneaker NFTs in the KH Merch store + MyJerry\n- OPTIONAL: Buy Sneaker NFTs in MyJerry and your Jerry can level up quicker\n\n**Sales**\n\n- Supply: 300 ~ 500\n- Price: 0.05 ~ 0.08 ETH\n- Marketplace: OpenSea\n- Split: 50% of gross margin (Sales - gas - marketplace fee) goes to the Krause House's treasury.\n\n**Cost**\n\n- No cost on Krause House",

      "title": "Product Team Budget",
      "content": "## Proposal\n\n- $20000 USDC + 10000 KRAUSE / month for two developers (stream **continuations**)\n- 3 month duration\n- Paid end of month starting August 1\n\n## **Summary**\n\nWe propose the ratification of an official team for product development within Krause House. This team’s sole purpose will be to build products that give Krause House the greatest chance of survival. The team will include a variety of developers, designers, and PMs, 75% of which **must** be full-time. This requirement will allow the team to operate much like a traditional startup with daily standups, weekly retrospectives, etc. The team will operate as transparently as possible to allow for proper performance evaluation. We are requesting $20K + 10K KRAUSE / month in initial funding for 2 developers. Both these developers are already on streams of similar value, so **this would incur a minimal increase in monthly cost to the DAO**. This ratification and funding will require renewal by a vote every 3 months.\n\nNote: This funding listed in this proposal will retroactively begin August 1, 2022\n\n## **Purpose**\n\nThe Product Team’s objective is *to build products that give Krause House the greatest chance of survival*. This mission is intentionally vague, as we’d like to maintain the ability to pivot as needed. However, it’s important to note *what* gives Krause House the greatest chance of survival (and world domination) involves a constant dialogue between the Product Team’s leadership and token-holders.\n\n## **Evaluating Team Performance**\n\nThe team will operate with high transparency, especially in determining and reporting on goals to help the DAO accurately evaluate the team’s performance. Each project will have roadmaps, timelines, and resources made publicly available to members of the DAO. Major team decisions and calls will be published to the #announcements channel on Discord, and the team will report on progress at Krause House’s weekly town halls.\n\nDAO members should use this information when evaluating the team’s renewals. If at any time a Krause House member feels they do not have sufficient information to evaluate the team’s performance, they should let the team know along with any suggestions for improvement. However, the team is not required to follow said suggestions but is required to make an effort towards providing the information when possible.\n\n## **Operations**\n\nThe team will operate as close to a standard startup as possible. We will conduct daily stand-up meetings, weekly retrospectives, peer-to-peer reviews, etc. We will also require that 75% or more of team members work for the Product Team **full time**. Finally, we will establish a 6-hour time window in which all team members must be online MWF. This does not imply team members will only be working during those windows (see full-time requirement), but to create blocks of time in which communication is *easiest*. This will minimize blockers and communication bottlenecks that are rampant in DAOs. Team members will aim to produce the highest quality work they are capable of.\n\nProjects will be determined and prioritized based on the DAO’s best interests at the time and the current opportunities available to us. While this is somewhat abstract, it is meant to enable flexibility based on where Krause House is and where it is headed. All major decisions will involve consultations with the stewards (most notably Flex who will serve as a member of the Product Team), token-holders, and the end users for a proposed product.\n\nNote: In the early stages, the team will only have the capacity for one project at a time and will place a premium on focus.\n\nMembers will be paid through Utopia.\n\n## **Initial Team**\n\nAny team member must be explicitly added to the Product Team through a proposal. Ratification and renewal proposals can act as this proposal, or they may be added through a separate proposal. Once a team member has been officially added through a proposal that confirms their working status to be within the requirements of the Product Team, they can begin receiving compensation from the Product Team’s funding.\n\nWe propose the following individuals to be the Product Team’s initial members:\n\n- Flex Chapman - Adviser\n- gregfromstl - Development & Design\n    \n    Commitment: Full-time (**minimum** 40 hours per week, as before)\n    \n    Compensation: $12K + 5K KRAUSE monthly (continuation of previous stream + 1k KRAUSE)\n    \n- Trik - Development\n    \n    Commitment: Full-time (**minimum** 40 hours per week, increase from part-time)\n    \n    Compensation: $8K + 5K KRAUSE monthly\n    \n\nWhile the team is small, members will operate across specialties to fill any gaps in design and product management. Greg has experience in both areas and Flex will assist in product management along the way.\n\n## **Team Qualifications**\n\nOver the past four months, the proposed team members have shipped the apps found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16J67C42yqDcRVVkdrjlM2qFIPeXmTROjUExwxOLZHvg/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "title": "Fund: Documentary style trailer telling KH & Ball Hogs story for season 1",
      "content": "### Proposal\n\n- $7,500 USDC upfront funding to 0xeFD9740AEBfF6039322A02206e8266F70DEc10ee\n- $3,500 KRAUSE\n- Crabtree will submit receipts.\n\n### How will funds be used?\n\n- Dallas flight for 1 weekend to film content\n- Alabama flight for 2-3 days to film content\n- Game day video assistant for three hours during Week 7. Potential game day assistant for three hours during week 8 games to capture generic footage (crabtree can not attend, but will direct from afar)\n- One day video lighting rental if needed\n- Approximately 40 hours of video capture (some already completed). Approximately 20-40 hours of editing. Additional hours of planning, setup, audio recording, and post-production\n- Post-production assistant if needed (included in above editing hours)\n\n### Duration\n\nWe’ve kickstarted some efforts in July, but future work will take roughly 1-2 months to complete. \n\n---\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\nThrough the course of the season we have captured media elements and a  great narrative around the fan engagement initiatives of Uncle Jon and the Pig Pen team. This project is to piece together those elements into collateral we can present to NBA front offices and other teams.\n\nWe will produce a shorter asset (e.g. documentary trailer) that highlights Uncle Jon’s efforts for the BIG3 and its relation to the DAO. This is a value-add by:\n\n- Building a ‘Who is Uncle Jon and The Pig Pen?’ asset for Krause House to advance media approach\n- Telling a relatable, engaging story of a community member who elevated the experience for all stakeholders in our first team ownership venture\n- Sharing a template and ability for a fan-controlled team to replicate during future team ownership conversations\n- Showing more native media capabilities inside Krause House\n- Showcasing top-tier fan activation by a fan-controlled team\n\n---\n\n## Team\n\n#unclejon = CEO and who I will be reporting into\n\nProducers = combination of myself, in-house help when available, and freelance post-production\n\nKrause House Community = crowdsourced questions, ideas, and digital pushes\n\nBIG3 and Ball Hogs personalities \n\n### Deliverables\n\n“The Uncle Jon Story” Trailer\n\n**Overview:**\nA trailer focusing Uncle Jon’s growing involvement with the Ball Hogs and creation of ‘The Pig Pen’. The story follows his preparation for a BIG3 game and everything that goes into it, why he got into leading Ball Hogs fans, explanation of Krause House helping facilitate this opportunity, and other interviews on what its like being Uncle Jon on and off the court. The angle is fun and humorous, but educational. \n\nThe footage will take place in Dallas during Ball Hogs and BIG3 game weekends, travel to and from the arena, and his hometown in Alabama. We have captured a fair amount already around gameday activities. \n\nThe trailer is meant to tease a full length story at a later date, which the DAO can tackle separately if needed. The asset will also be able to standalone for immediate use.\n\nWe are missing footage and interviews with key BIG3 personalities to tell this story, thus having very focused shoots moving forward. \n\nContent needed:\n- Direct interviews\n- Cutaways\n- Archival from Ball Hogs season\n- Direct cinema\n- Behind the scenes, follow-alongs, etc.\n\nStoryboard:\n\n*Rough draft and only focusing on visuals for proposal. Audio, camera shots, images and effects later.*\n\nS1 = Narrated Uncle Jon intro\nS2 = Pig Pen+Ball Hogs footage\nS3 = Uncle Jon direct interview\nS4 = “Day in the life” footage\nS5 = Accompanying direct interviews (BIG3 star power)\nS6 = Krause House impact overview\nS7 = Outro sequence\n\nSpecs:\nShot mainly for horizontal web consumption, but ability to be added to vertical social feeds if needed.\n\nEquipment (already owned):\n- DSLRs and camcorders\n- Shotgun, lavalier, condenser, and other external microphones\n- Tripod and gimbal\n- Adobe Premiere CC\n- Miscellaneous video shooting and production tools",

      "content": "## Author\n\n**Abraham Muheize**\n\nJuly 14,2022\n\n**Role**: Marketing & Community Outreach Specialist\n\n## Initiative: \nConnect with the local community to create a fan base for the game on July 30th. Run social media during the game and produce high level content to keep fans engaged who are not at the live event.\nStewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point. Stewards may cancel this agreement if BIG3 ceases operations that would impact this stream.\n\nThis proposal can also be canceled via community vote (as is the case with any proposal)\n\n**Dates: July 27- August 1**\n\nAbraham Muheize: $2,000\n\nApolonia + Team (3 people): $2,400\n\nHotel: $500 (Possibly Free)\n\nFlight: $350\n\nTotal: $5,250\n\n(Players for hire $600-$700 / Gym $500-$1,000)\n\n- All the fees may be subject to change depending on when this proposal gets approved.\n\nFunds will be sent to Abrahamm.eth in the form of USDC. Once the proposal is approved, will book flight and hotel. Receipts for flight and hotel will be provided and any unused amount will be reimbursed.\n\n**Merch-optional**\n\n*10-14 day turn around*\n\nYouth T-Shirts: 1,000 dri-fit T-shirts- $6 + $1,400 Shipping\n\n500 dri- fit T-Shirts- $8 + $700 Shipping\n\nWrist Bands: $3.50 + $400 Shipping\n\nTeam\n\n- itsunclejon #7365\n\n## Project Details & Approach\n\n1. Outreach and connect with basketball influencers in the Dallas area.\n    1. AAU Coaches\n    2. Boys and Girls Club\n    3. Basketball Influencers in the area\n    4. Summer School programs\n2. Research activities for the week of the 30th.\n    1. Scout 1-3 locations to make an appearance at every single day leading into the games and offer tickets and swag (Shirts, wristbands)\n    2. Goal is to enlist a few players for content marketing and appeal. I will reach out to and connect with basketball influencers in the area. We can offer to pay them $75-$100 to make an appearance at one of the locations or all of the locations I get scheduled. They would have to approve of this fee of course. Any expenses will be documented.\n    3. Get in front of as many kids as possible to make an impact with the game of basketball. Play games like knock out and get all the kids involved. Inform and educate what we are doing and invite them all out to the free event on Friday July 29th and the game on July 30th.\n3. The goal is to schedule an event Friday July 29th in a gym in Frisco, TX.\n    1. The plan is to have tons of freebies to give out and make the event free for youth to come out too. The impact we want to create is to have the community, families and especially the youth to come out and support a positive sport.\n    2. Apple Thomas is in the Dallas area and has been working with Ball Hogs the last few weeks. I plan to connect with her and more important contacts to help locate the best basketball influencers in the Dallas area. Ideally we would love to have 2-4 players so that we can run a youth basketball event. Goal is to find someone who can create a fun and exciting environment which will make them come back. Someone who can dunk for the kids would probably be a favorite, and possibly influencers who add not play but love the sport and love giving back to the youth.\n4. During the game Instagram and Twitter pages will be accessed and content will be produced. This will get those who are not live at the event tune in and excited about the amazing event. Content will be quickly created so we do not lose the focus and attention of our participants and viewers. From experience we have noticed that most people are not going to watch full games or go back to video footage to look for highlights. (Chase, the videographer will capture everything horizontally and I will capture everything vertically).\n    1. The IG Story will get flooded with content from the game and tagging those involved.\n    2. The IG posts will be the best high lights (Dunk, crazy shot, good play)\n    3. Twitter, we will update the same as the IG Posts\n    4. I will interview players, coaches, and fans at the game.\n    5. With all the content we capture, we will be able to have them for all platforms, edited, and posted the same day and following. Also, content to have throughout the week leading into the next week's games.\n    \n ## Krause House ROI\n    \nThe importance of building a fanbase with Ball Hogs represents what Krause House has to offer long term. One of the most important things Krause House and Ball Hogs can do is get involved in the community. Creating a fan base though the youth who grow up seeing Krause House on all apparel, social media, banners, and PR is crucial. \n\n## Investing in the Community:\n\n- Reaching out to the youth\n- Free youth camps / clinics\n- Content for social media\n- Documenting the impact of starting from no fan base to creating a fan base\n- Proving success in building a professional team\n    - Big 3 has struggled with a fan base and that is because they have not got out into the community. They have been around 5 years!\n    - In a short period of time we can show growth in a fanbase, hype around the team and league.\n- Future Krause House Events will benefit on all the content and hype built around the Ball Hogs Team.\n\nFrom 2017-2020 I created San Diego Kings basketball team. The focus was heavy on getting into community outreach and marketing. Based on that experience I believe that Ball Hogs can get into the community and make an impact, skyrocket the fan base, and capture amazing content for social media. The goal is to have the fanbase fall in love with the team, emotionally get them connected to the games and social media so that they are always engaged. Basketball is my passion and every event I am part of it’s a guaranteed success. I look forward to having many successful events together.\n\nAbraham Muheize\n\n## BIO-\n\nAbraham Muheize, born and raised in San Diego. Entrepreneur, Public Speaker, Marketer, and Community Activist. Co-Owner and founder of the San Diego Kings, a professional Basketball team in the American Basketball Association..

      "content": "### Ball Hogs Pod + Budget\n\nAuthor: **commodore#0145 & itsunclejon#7365**\n\n---\n\n### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\nAs Ball Hogs CEO, coming off a very successful first 3 weeks of fan engagement operations, this proposal is to continue operating fan engagement at Ball Hog games for the remainder of the season. (This does not include playoffs)\n\n---\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\n- Total: $25k\n    - This is to cover Week 4 - 8\n    - This **does not** include a budget for playoffs\n\n### How will funds be used?\n\nExamples include, but not limited to:\n\n- Travel (✈️ 🚗) for Uncle Jon +1 to/from market\n- Accommodations for Uncle Jon +1 (same room)\n- Fan engagement paraphernalia\n- Tailgate supplies\n- Support staff\n- Relationship building w/ BIG3 & players\n\nFunding Breakdown (weekly):\n\nTravel: 40%\n\nSupplies: 20%\n\nEngagement Assistants: 20%\n\nPlayer and Big3 relationship building (team dinner and media): 20%\n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\n1. Delegating full spending authority to itsunclejon#7365\n2. Upfront funding to `0x1CeE9a6DEcB5148df32C938738A8903fA8dd9aC5`\n3. Uncle Jon will submit receipts for each transaction\n4. Any funds not used will be returned to the DAO\n\n---\n\n### Team\n\n- **itsunclejon#7365**\n- **commodore#0145**\n\n### Project Details\n\nThe intention of this proposal is to fund the remainder of the season for in-person Ball Hogs experiences + delegate control for day-to-day decisions to itsunclejon#7365. Delegating to itsunclejon#7365 who will be regularly in attendance to make budget, operations, and personnel decisions is paramount for rapid iteration. \n\n### How will we be operating / engaging fans more specifically?\n\nThe “thesis” of our mission overall is to create the most fun and family friendly fan section in all of basketball. I believe this is done via two methods.\n\n1. Win in the community\n    1. By talking to fans at the games and building relationships, our goal is to give back to people locally who are serving their communities. This intentional fostering of connections gives us a pulse of how to spread our broader goal to the areas we visit throughout the season. The target is to create a sense of belonging for people who join the pig pen and driving engagement through the formation of these friendships and experiences\n2. Winning the pre-game\n    1. The whole “Pig Pen” experience is about creating a “Pixar-esque” set up where kids are having a blast getting involved and parents are having a blast because their kids are having a blast and also because they are genuinely having a blast. #havingablast.",

      "content": "### ELI5 (Explain it Like I’m 5) Project Value-Add\n\n- Reduce friction for contributors to start getting paid by funding them from a team directly.\n- Increase contributors’ accountability by requiring check-ins, proof of work, and peer feedback.\n\n---\n\n### Requested Budget:\n\n$150k USDC, 100k KRAUSE\n\n### How will funds be used?\n\nPay contributors to Krause House who support with ongoing projects. We currently have 11 contributors. We plan to increase that to ~15 in the coming months. Mainly those new contributors are supporting with revenue generating opportunities such as MyJerry, and the Ball Hogs loyalty programs (see below project details section). \n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\nThis team will not actually hold the funds directly. We will just accept payment requests in Utopia. Multisig can deny any request. Multisig should deny any request outside the scope of this proposal, or anything they deem as malicious.\n\n### Team\n\n- Dogstoevsky#0585\n- Brandan#3793\n\n### Conflicts of interest:\n\nBoth authors of this proposals receive funding from this budget.\n\n---\n\n### Project Details\n\n*(This is a renewal of this proposal: [https://krausehousework.notion.site/Contributor-Compensation-Budget-Team-fe37e86b7af7490da91cd99558a82826](https://www.notion.so/Contributor-Compensation-Budget-Team-fe37e86b7af7490da91cd99558a82826))*\n\n### Process\n\nDog and Brandan support contributors with regular check-ins, administrative support, and require Proof of Work and Peer Feedback to collect funding. The Proof of Work and Peer Feedback process is a process by which contributors submit a report that lists out the work done in the prior month as well as who in Krause House can confirm the work was done (the validators). \n\nFrom there, Brandan and Dog submit a survey to the validators confirming the work was completed as well as some qualitative and quantitative questions regarding the contributor. Brandan and Dog then use that feedback to guide contributors in future months. \n\nPoW and Feedback gets compared between people, and if someone is not delivering on a relative basis, they can get removed from the budget pool.\n\nPeople who want to collect payment submit **POW AND REFERENCES** [here](https://airtable.com/shrDqOGKjkAF5gmIJ) every month. This is after already being vetted and recruited to this team. \n\nWe expect this funding will last at least 3 months (spending ~ $40K per month). \n\n### Intentions\n\nWe will be primarily funding contributors focused on:\n\n- ***Creating potential revenue opportunities**:* these exist in the form of products or services—or anything with reasonable potential to be monetized.\n- ***Building brand power and awareness**:* this primarily refers to social media content and media partnerships that spread the Krause House name.\n\nOver the next several months we plan to focus on building out Krause House’s product portfolio and potentially could fork this team into a Product budget and a Brand budget. \n\nPeople can get paid from this team indefinitely (at whatever the competitive market rate is for their role) as this allows us to provide some payment security and stability to full-time contributors. \n\n### How do we pick who to fund?\n\nIf we speak to someone, and we feel like they can further the KH brand or do something with the potential to generate capital, we give them a small amount of money for 30 days. After 30 days, we assess whether we should give them competitive compensation to aggressively pursue their objectives or not. It’s all subjective. People we have previously granted funding to:\n\n- Denny - Developer building MyJerry\n- Kevtae - Developer building MyJerry\n- Boosh - Strategy and art for MyJerry\n- UncleJon - Building Ball Hogs and supporting with the Ball Hogs fan loyalty program\n- Omar - Partnerships & Merch\n- Views - Partnership & Agents\n- Clavis - KH University & Agents\n- Edgy - Agents\n\nAll funding is public. HERE: [https://krausehousework.notion.site/Contributor-Experience-Grants-2d23a290ff4740e1b6049021b057a3ba](https://www.notion.so/Contributor-Experience-Grants-2d23a290ff4740e1b6049021b057a3ba)\n\n---\n\n### Previous Work\n\n- [Retrospective on May (first month)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A0AVaFSrm_B99QIh1_1xNNkfzer2KvJeifrwDYhI9uI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThis team was previously granted $75k USDC and $ 75k KRAUSE for May 1. \n\nUp to this point, we have spent $36k USDC and 30k KRAUSE: \n\nThis was primarily deployed to people working on Krause House University, MyJerry, Esports, legal feeds, and Member Benefits.\n\nThis new funding will primarily be deployed to teams working on:\n\n- MyJerry App\n- Ball Hogs Loyalty App + Program\n- Ball Hogs event planning and attendance\n\nAnd we would like to onboard contributors to work on:\n\n- Decentralized Investment Operations\n- Media and Brand\n\nWith the increase to our reserves we should be able to fund these initiatives for at least 3 months (expected spend ~ $40K per month) without worrying about future proposals like this one.",

If hotel accommodations are needed, Holiday Inn Express is the preferred Chain. If car rental is needed, Enterprise will also be used and the cheapest rental option will be selected. \n\nChicago 06/19 Game: \n\n- 647.20 - Flight cost (flight already purchased)\n\nChicago 06/26 Game: \n\n- 689.20 - Flight Cost\n\nDallas 07/01 Game:     \n\n- $567.20 - Flight Cost\n\n### How will funds be managed?\n\n- Funds will be added after proposal passing to @itsunclejon wallet\n- Ad-hoc Pig Pen supplies will be purchased by itsunclejon and reimbursed after DAO approval. This will keep the priority of extra costs to be budget and cost-effective.\n- The total travel budget limit for the first 3 games, which require my attendance, will be $3500 USD (to anticipate possible spike in flight costs/car rental/hotel accommodations). Any costs beyond that fall under the responsibility of @itsunclejon. Travel expenses not utilized in first 3 weekends of Big3 season will be reimbursed back to DAO\n- Funds will be added to @itsunclejon wallet and funds not used will be sent back to KH ETH wallet.\n- Travel and other tailgate funding needed will be re-addressed in future proposals after the 06/26 weekend.\n\n---\n\n### Team\n\n- **Mario Lopes#2725 [As a resource. Ineligible for funding]**\n- **greg_#4668 [As a resource, ineligible for funding]**\n\n### Project Details\n\n1. To foster a locally fueled and rabid fan base known as “The Pig Pen”, Creating a fun community outside of the stadium that will carry inside the confines and cheer on the hawgs in a rowdy, yet sportsmanlike, way.\n2. Creating excitement and fandom at events will lead to piqued interest in fan-owned basketball. By having a Krause House info booth at the tailgate and inside the stadium, fans who are “high on the hog” will have access to resources that provide more info about the DAO and how to get involved. We will have free KH stickers with QR codes and a possible NFT raffle.\n3. Some sort of allocation of our ownership tickets will be either given away or raffled off during the tailgate.\n\n### Approach\n\n**Chicago**\n\n- On Opening Day for the Ball Hogs in Chicago (Sun 06/19 & 06/25 ) @greg_ and myself will set up our informational booth and hand out QR code stickers that will send those who scan to our Community messaging app, which will allow us to send call to actions via text message to initiate onboarding in to KH.\n- While in Chicago, we will scope out the general crowd population and flow of the day to inform how to execute an effective tailgate when the Big3 moves to Dallas for the remainder of the season.\n- Through talks with the Big3, Chicago will be a test environment for later strategies including, but not limited to:\n    - Timeout entertainment/games\n    - Concession rewards program with MyJerry or merch\n    - T-shirt Cannon\n    - A bit of controlled team competition to disrupt the “player based” fandom currently in Big3.\n\n**Dallas**\n\n- Before each Ball Hogs game, we will set up the tailgating supplies that KH will own and supply a limited amount of food and alcohol for attendees.\n- There will also be music, raffles of tickets and merch to be given out throughout the “pre-game”\n- We have been given parking lot approval that includes electrical plug so no generator is needed.\n\n### Target Metric\n\n- Each game, the goal is to acquire at least 35 members to sign up via the Community phone number. (goal is subject to adjustment by proposal team or DAO)\n    - The Community text app will be our ticket to fostering a real basketball community. We will come up with incentives for future game attendance and work to create a roadmap to drive engagement.\n- Each game, we seek to have at least 75 dedicated Ball Hogs fans in the stands. Myself and any other KH reps will lead the crowd in chants & support for the Piggies.\n    - We have been given permission by the Big3 to convert our 50 VIP tickets to 100 GA tickets to be distributed prior to the game. We will adjust the ratio game-by-game and reserve the VIP tickets for raffles and influencer giveaways.\n    \n\n[**Disclaimer:** With any new fan venture, there is always a risk that creating a new fan base from scratch is difficult to predict. The silver lining is that we don’t have a fan base at all currently and the hope is that by the end of the season we will have created a fun fan environment that increases our chances of Big3 fans showing up cheering on the Ball Hogs exclusively.]",

      "content": "---\n### Proposal\nGrant the Stewardship team the ability to leave a brief comment on any Snapshot proposal.\n\n---\n\n### Context\n\nThe Stewardship team are currently delegated powers and responsibility to veto unclear or blatantly malicious proposals moving to Snapshot.  This proposal advocates that we grant the Stewardship team the ability to leave a brief comment on any Snapshot proposal in order to give voters more context on the proposal.  This power can be re-delegated by proposal, and the holder of this power is *not allowed to transfer it without community approval*.\n\n### Intention\n\nThe Stewardship team is meant to act merely as a safety mechanism to prevent unclear or blatantly malicious proposals from moving to Snapshot.  However, we believe that voters view Snapshot proposals as already having significant support from the community.  This is **not** necessarily the case.  By allowing the Stewardship team to write a brief comment on a proposal, we can give voters more context on the vote, without needing to compromise on the openness of the proposal system as it exists now.\n\n### What if the Stewards don’t agree?\n\nStewards must be in *full alignment* about the comment.  ***One veto*** on the comment is sufficient to block it.  ***This is meant to ensure that the team acts only in clear cases***.\n\n### Example\n\nSomeone submits a proposal asking for an inordinately large sum of money for some deliverable while other Jerry’s are willing to do the work for significantly less.  The proposal is clear and specific, so the Stewards should, and do, move this to Snapshot; however, it does *not* include the context that others are willing to do the same work for less.  ***By leaving a comment on the proposal, the Stewards can inform voters as to the context to better inform the vote.***\n\n### Reversibility\n\nCommunity members can submit a proposal to remove this power from the Stewardship team at any time.  In addition, the Stewards team can remove themselves from this position.  However, they ***cannot*** **transfer** it to another party.\n\n### Inclusion\n\nNote, Jerry’s who have relevant information or context about a proposal can and should reach out to a Steward such that a comment can be left.  For instance, if a Jerry has knowledge and examples of a specific proposer’s relevant misconduct, they are encouraged to let the Stewards team know. \n\n### Current Stewardship Team\n\nView Roster @ [Permissions Database](https://www.notion.so/4589c7e790134019bc4e29753a225d09)\n\n- Commodore\n- Flex Chapman\n- Mario Lopes\n- Spicetrae\n- Magnus\n- GladRobot\n- Lewwwk\n- Dogstoevsky",

      "content": "**Author:** Bayesian Baller\n\nHead to [#📜discuss-proposals](https://discord.gg/Mf8FHpHF) to comment.\n\n---\n\n**Recipient:** Bayesian Baller\n\n**Wallet:** 0xD9b3Ad0eb0d3b9DF83CE919198F9ad0Ff692522F\n\nUp to:\n\n- 2k $KRAUSE / month\n- 2k USDC / month\n\nPaid monthly for 3 months (in arrears to June 1st).\n\nStewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.\n\nCommunity may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.\n\n---\n\n**Scope of Work**\n\n*A stream request is designed to give contributors freedom and encouragement to work across multiple domains across the DAO; however, here are the current main focuses / intentions:*\n\n**1) Around The Association**\n\nResearch, record, produce, and market roughly 4 podcast episodes per month that drive community engagement, demonstrate the community’s basketball acumen, break down the barrier to entry to get non-crypto fans interested in Web3 / DAOs, and generate ad revenue for the Krause House treasury. Bayesian Baller has already released [16 episodes of Around The Association](https://open.spotify.com/show/3YadlLpwrMTOG0ecvX65bw) and interviewed a variety of guests including NBA players, coaches, and front office members.\n\nGuest list for the summer includes:\n\n- Stacy Davis, BIG3 Ball Hogs Player\n- Jeremy Woo, Writer & NBA Draft Analyst at Sports Illustrated\n- Jorge Costa, former Director of Analytics at Detroit Pistons\n- Mustafa Abdul-Hamid, EVP of Arria Boost and former UCLA teammate of Russell Westbrook, Jrue Holiday, & Kevin Love\n- Ross McMains, former Head of Player Development & Video Coordinator at New York Knicks & Sacramento Kings\n\n**2) Data Science & Basketball Analytics**\n\nSpearhead the Ball Hogs’ basketball analytics initiatives during the 2022 BIG3 season. This includes laying the groundwork for the Ball Hogs’ analytics database and using it to build data-driven scouting reports on a weekly basis for HC Rick Barry and the players to use for game-planning purposes. It also includes facilitating opportunities with leaders in the sports analytics industry, collaborating with other team’s and communities to advance the collective analytics expertise of the BIG3, as well as, establishing a framework for a dedicated basketball strategy and analytics team within Krause House.\n\nAs a proof of subject matter expertise, below are several examples of Bayesian Baller’s past basketball analytics work. Bayesian will taking his learnings from these past analytics projects and apply them to his work with Ball Hogs this summer:\n\nClick here to read Bayesian Baller’s plan for the Ball Hogs’ analytics efforts:\n\n- [Krause House x BIG3: Analytics Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YAY9o97L_SPXbiyLezhD116YGbTwonR0VFZtZmO6RxY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nClick here to learn about the Boost Coaching Analytics platform for which Bayesian Baller has served as the Product Owner (clients include Florida, Louisville, and UCLA among others):\n\n- [Boost Sport AI: Coaching Analytics Product](https://boostsport.ai/)\n\nClick here for a few past samples of Bayesian Baller’s analytics work with the UCLA Bruins Men’s Basketball team:\n\n- [UCLA Bruins: 2018-19 Offseason Analytics Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IZw9G0hBy1CvHpnnq1v2QYO1ATFJ7eo-/view?usp=sharing)\n- [UCLA Bruins: 2019-20 Offseason Analytics Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zCxzqs1q_VM1sJgeSocxLn7njfwixYRJ/view?usp=sharing)\n\nClick here for some analytics work Bayesian Baller did that was featured in Sports Illustrated on a daily cover story leading up to the 2021 NBA Draft:\n\n- [Sports Illustrated: Why Cade Cunningham Is the No. 1 Pick](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/07/29/cade-cunningham-nba-draft-daily-cover)\n\nClick here for a series of analytics reports Bayesian Baller completed during graduate school regarding on-court strategy and talent evaluation in the NBA:\n\n- [Offensive Putbacks, Why Bother?

They’ve formed a #pick-up-app channel in Discord, began recruiting power users, and plan to collaborate with other teams in KH for community building efforts.\n\n**4) Media Team Contributions**\n\nBayesian Baller is a content creator and contributor to the Krause House Media Team. In addition to his weekly podcast, he also creates audiograms, social media posts, and markets KH to the world across a variety of media channels. Here are a few examples of past posts from Bayesian Baller that have received 25,000+ views and impressions for KH on social media: [1](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1496651590605754368?s=20&t=SJulbTliE85EI8ouIyjkWQ), [2](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1494481064303104000?s=20&t=SJulbTliE85EI8ouIyjkWQ), [3](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1491592759420936196?s=20&t=SJulbTliE85EI8ouIyjkWQ), [4](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1487134724405743621?s=20&t=SJulbTliE85EI8ouIyjkWQ), [5](https://twitter.com/christianhanish/status/1468496834251264001?s=20&t=SJulbTliE85EI8ouIyjkWQ), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsanalytics/comments/sy6fy9/how_to_land_a_job_in_the_nba_behind_the_scenes/), [7](https://www.reddit.com/r/heat/comments/sy750o/podcast_interview_with_former_heat_data_analyst/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), [8](https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA_Draft/comments/v3k2jd/podcast_interview_w_nba_player_about_the_draft/)\n\n**Weekly Breakdown**\n\n*A detailed breakdown of how Bayesian Baller’s time commitment to KH will be broken down across the aforementioned projects listed in the scope of work:*\n\n- Bayesian Baller will contribute roughly 15-20 hours per week (60-80 hours per month).\n- The time commitment breaks down to 5-10 hours per week towards media, podcasting (research, recording, post-production), and content creation (audiograms, social media).\n- Plus 5-10 hours spearheading Krause House’s basketball analytics initiatives for the Ball Hogs, as well as, managing the OpenRuns x KH partnership. In addition to contributing to KH’s weekly Media Team syncs and - of course - promoting good vibes through the community’s social spaces.\n\n**Bayesian Baller’s Background:**\n\n5+ years working professionally in basketball analytics, including the last 2.5 years as a Data Scientist / Product Manager for a leader in the basketball analytics space and the previous 2.5 years at the collegiate level with two major Div. 1 programs. Along the way, developed working relationships with a variety of influential figures in the basketball industry who will help facilitate partnerships and opportunities for Krause House to reach their ultimate goal of NBA ownership.\n\n---\n\n### Specification\n\nThis contributor may submit a request for *up to* the specified amount based on self-assessment of their work.\n\n### Intention\n\nThis is intended to encourage contributors to take immediate action on a wide range of problems/opportunities, as opposed to proceeding through the slower process of submitting a proposal for a narrow scope of work.\n\nWe prefer to invest in and groom talent, giving *them* the freedom and capital they need to be entrepreneurs within our community.  We value self-starters who are able to take action and deliver quality work.\n\n### bUt SomEb0dY m1gHt t@kE t0o mUçh\n\nBoth the community and the Stewardship team has the power to cancel this stream if it is being abused.  In addition, if a contributor abuses this trust, they are effectively burning their social credibility and ability to successfully submit proposals in the future.  We expect some lossiness; however, we believe the benefits of getting good work off the ground is worth this small cost.",

      "title": "Ball Hogs Executives Nomination",
      "content": "Author: Greg\n\n## Summary\n\nAs owners of the Ball Hogs, we get 3 executive positions to act as a liaison between our community and the BIG3. This proposal nominates Uncle Jon (CEO), Commodore (Chairman), and Flex Chapman (President) as those executives. The 3 will host biweekly meetings to both communicate Ball Hogs operations amongst themselves and the broader community (these meetings must be open to all Krause House ticket holders.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nWith the upcoming season quickly approaching, we urgently need to fill these roles and begin more formal operations of the Ball Hogs. Uncle Jon has been thoroughly involved with all Ball Hogs discussions up to this point and is committed to the team’s success. Commodore and Flex landed the original BIG3 deal and have a strong line of communication with the BIG3. The combination of these three individuals will provide a dual-sided approach to Krause-BIG3 communications as Uncle Jon focuses primarily on the community (Krause House) side, and Flex/Commodore focus on the BIG3 side. \n\nThis team is not meant to hold these roles indefinitely, but for this quickly approaching season. Their positions will expire as of the final day of the BIG3 season (the all-star game). In addition, they will need to agree to have thorough communications with the broader Krause House community and encourage involvement with the Ball Hogs for all interested members. In doing so, we hope to have a far greater pool of capable, enthusiastic, and grassroots candidates for these positions leading into the off-season.\n\n## Removal and Appointment\n\nAt any time, any current executive can be removed from office by the Stewards or through a vote by the community. The replacing executive would be nominated through a proposal and voted on by the community.\n\n## Feedback\n\nAs part of their duties, the executives will be responsible for gathering and publishing feedback from the community on a regular basis. If any community member feels one of the executives is doing a poor job in their role and needs removal / reevaluation, they may raise these concerns to the Stewards at the weekly meeting.",

      "content": "\n---\n\n### Proposal\n\nSwap $25,000 worth of $KRAUSE (30-day TWAP) for:\n\n- $5,000 of $FF\n- $5,000 of $HAUS\n- $5,000 of $CABIN\n- $5,000 of $YUP\n- $5,000 of $BANK\n\nAll of which will have a 3 year lock up.\n\n[TWAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-weighted_average_price) = Time Weighted Average Price\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nThe Treasury team proposes swapping $25,000 of $KRAUSE with five of the leading social token communities. This will have multiple benefits for Krause House, including diversifying our treasury, aligning us with leading social token communities, and improving DAO2DAO relationships.\n\nThe KH Treasury team has been in talks with Treasury teams of these communities. We are seeking to build a long-term alliance among the leading communities in the sector that should bring Krause House opportunities for years to come. This initial token swap is step one.\n\n### Alliance Members\n\n[Cabin](https://www.creatorcabins.com/) - A decentralized city built by creators, for creators.\n\n[Bankless](https://banklesshq.com/) - Ultimate program for crypto finance\n\n[Forefront](https://forefront.market/market) - The pulse of Web3 Social\n\n[Yup](https://yup.io/) - Social Network for curators in Web3\n\n[DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/community) - The community of contributors working together directly to design, build, and communicate.\n\nThe alliance was formed by the leaders in social-related tokenized communities spanning across areas of focus such as DeFi, media, sports, and .   \n\n### Motivation\n\nThis is an opportunity for Krause House to pioneer a D2D model with other leaders in the space. The following lists both immediate benefits and a few potential opportunities that could be spawned from such an alliance.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- Treasury Diversification: We would diversify into 5 of the leading social token communities in one swap. Token swaps are particularly valuable in that no $KRAUSE would need to be sold on the open market (thus putting downward pressure on our token).\n- Align ourselves financially with some of the leading social token communities. This should lead to greater collaborations and more opportunities for our community.\n- Establish metagovernance rights in the participating DAOs.\n- Pioneer a new form of multi-DAO Alliances.\n- Future opportunities for collaboration amongst Alliance partners may include joining lobbying efforts, contributor sharing, collateralized loans, liquidity solutions, a joint VC fund, and more.\n\n### Mechanism\n\nKrause House would send $25,000 to a multi-sig wallet (of which we would be a signer). In return, we would receive:\n\n$5,000 of $FF\n\n$5,000 of $HAUS\n\n$5,000 of $CABIN\n\n$5,000 of $YUP\n\n$5,000 of $BANK\n\n- Tokens would be subject to a minimum of a three-year lock. However, the expectation amongst all involved is that alliance tokens will be held for the long-term.\n- Price will be based on a 30-day TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price)\n- Treasury will be stored will be via a multi-sig with a member from each community assigned\n\n### Vote\n\nYes - Vote Yes to approve Treasury Diversification: Token Swap Alliance Proposal\n\nNo - Vote No to not approve Treasury Diversification: Token Swap Alliance Proposal",

Proposal\n2. Vision\n3. Retrospective\n4. Going Forward\n\n---\n\n## Proposal\n\nA monthly budget of $42,501 USDC + 7,500 $KRAUSE to fund a set of full-time contributors. Budgets and responsibilities for each contributor are outlined below, and will be paid monthly, starting effective (in arrears) May 1st, 2022 after proposal passing. Contributors can be fired at any point by the DAO through proposal, at which point future payments will cease.\n\nTo receive payment, members of this team must retain 100% of their airdropped allocation of $KRAUSE balances for 2 years (as of Jan 1st, 2022) or until no longer being compensated as a full-time contributor.\n\n***Monthly***\n\n| **Name**     | **Style**        | **$USDC**  | **$KRAUSE** |\n| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- |\n| Commodore    | Fixed            | 16,667     | 0           |\n| Flex Chapman | Fixed            | 16,667     | 0           |\n| Mario Lopes  | Fixed            | 9,167      | 7,500       |\n| **Total**    |                  | **42,501** | **7,500**  |\n\n## How long?\n\n6 months starting (in arrears) May 1st, 2022.\n\n## Accountability Check-Ins\n\nThe team will provide a progress report in a written form monthly to the community. \n\n## Why are these 3 people a team?\n\nCommodore, Flex, & Mario have been working closely on all aspects of the DAO since its’ inception giving us high context. Each of us has a general different focus, but the overlap between the 3 provides a strong foundation to be able to quickly assist all areas of the DAO. \n\n---\n\n# Vision\n\nKrause House has made incredible progress in a short period of time, yet there’s so much more left to do. A purchase of a BIG3 team is an exciting step of progress against our roadmap of building credibility, yet we aspire for *many* positions across *many* leagues to build a portfolio of credibility. We need more experimentation, governance, & ultimately wins — to show the NBA that a DAO is worthy of ownership.\n\nWhat we’ve learned the most in the past 5 months is that professional sports are ready for DAOs to join the cap table. Our offer is unique & compelling. The value proposition of DAO ownership is strong, and more importantly — the future. We’ve been engaged with several NBA teams & there’s general alignment in getting a minority deal done. We intend to close one (or maybe all) of these positions. There are legal, financial, and operational negotiations + details that need to be agreed upon & implemented.\n\nThe future of Krause House has its’ hands both directly & indirectly in a portfolio of different professional sports teams. Krause House is a network of Jerrys that can bundle (and unbundle) capital + governance into the world of professional sports. Ownership in professional sports has been traditionally restricted to the wealthy few, but with web3 we have a new path to give fans a voice + equity in their passion.\n\nWe need to demonstrate success with the assets we do own, continue to initiate + close deals for more ownership positions, & provide a best-in-class DAO experience along the way for all of our Jerrys.\n\nTo demonstrate success with the assets we do own, we’ll need to focus on being the best owners we can be via the Ball Hogs. Building out a strong media presence, engaging our fans + BIG3’s, & selling merchandise for our team. Additionally, continuing to work more deeply with the BIG3 as a league to show how DAOs can serve as a partner at both the team & league level. \n\nWe continue to maintain a high bar of quality for the ownership positions worth pursuing, with our eyes set on a NBA minority position. These pitches take networking, deck building, & pitching to sell the vision of “why Krause House”. Additionally, we need to continue to invent legal / financial / operational structures to meet the needs of the NBA, lawyers, & regulations. This is a large & complex body of work, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We’ll continue to push the envelope here to bring a v1 solution for all of the stakeholders. \n\nWhile we work on these “external” initiatives, it’s important we continue deliver a best-in-class DAO experience for our Jerrys. At the end of the day, we’re a social DAO and pride ourselves in operating at a high level as a DAO. Part of the magic of Krause House is that we’ve attracted top talent from web3 because we value DAO-excellence, this is something we must continue to prioritize attracting (and retaining) top web3 talent. \n\nThe macro environment has changed dramatically over the past few months, but these bear times are when the strong survive. Our value proposition is strong. Our talent is strong. Our progress is strong. This is our moment to be ambitious and bold. It’s time for us to double down, work hard, & deliver high quality work. \n\nWAGBAT — We’re All Gonna Buy ALL Teams\n\n---\n\n# Retrospective\n\n## Commodore (Jan - April 22)\n\n*Overview*\n\nProvide leadership & continuity for Krause House DAO by working to build scalable systems & processes for the “infrastructure” of KH’s operations.\n\n- DAO Operations\n    - Communications\n    - Legal\n    - Finance\n        - Accounting\n        - Payroll / Payments\n        - Vendor Relations\n        - Multi-Sig Signer\n    - Governance Structure\n- Knowledge\n    - Sharing\n    - Gathering\n\n### Summary of Commodore’s Work\n\nPitched NBA team for minority position.

He will work closely with Commodore, Flex, and Stewards to:\n\n- Establish a capital coordination CRM\n- Curate community introductions and meet with potential capital providers and intermediaries\n- Coordinate development of capital strategy and partnership opportunities\n- Interface with DIO, International Expansion, and other teams with large scale capital needs\n- Support capital structuring and entity formation as required\n\n---\n\n### Oversight\n\nCore and Stewards will be able to monitor progress through the CRM and existing stewards communication channels to ensure value is being delivered in line with this proposal and Krause House’s needs.\n\n### Context and Rationale\n\nThis proposal is to provide immediate capacity to assist Krause House in attracting and securing the capital it needs to realize its mission.\n\nLewwwk already has a deep understanding of Krause House, its capital needs, and its potential role in the future of sports and web3. He has an active background venture, finance and capital markets particularly as applied to systems transformation; has represented Krause House in media; initiated the DIO and Purpose & Values teams; is an Owner’s Box ticket holder; and serves as a Steward.\n\n### What Does Success Look Like\n\n> Difficult by one, achievable by many.\n> \n\nSuccess would look like a Krause House developing a basic capital coordination capacity that could serve the growing capital needs of the Krause House community.\n\n**Process and Infrastructure**\n\n- Capital relationship CRM to track capital opportunities (e.g. acquisitions) and commitments\n- Over 500 potential capital providers identified (investors and intermediaries)\n- Over 150 formal interactions with potential capital providers (by core and stewards)\n- Initial entities and/or mechanisms established for first fund or acquisition vehicle\n\n**Capital Commitments**\n\n- Capital closed for Krause House Venture Fund > $5mm\n- Acquisition anchor commitments (soft-circled) > $10mm for NBA team acquisition\n- Treasury diversification round commitments (soft-circled) > $1mm\n\n\n⚠️ Given market volatility and macro sentiment, it is highly likely that one or more of the capital commitment goals will not be met within this 3 month time frame. We should at minimum though be well positioned to fulfill the highest priority capital needs of Krause House entering into September 2022.\n",

In November, we conducted an [NFT sale on Mirror](https://krausehouse.mirror.xyz/), selling 3 tiers of NFT tickets that granted membership/access to Krause House.\n2. The rights and privileges of this membership will change and grow over time as Krause House expands its capacities.\n3. Krause House is conducting an digi-physical NFT sale at [NFT.NYC](http://NFT.NYC) where physical sections of a basketball court will be sold, and an accompanying NFT will be issued.\n4. We would like these buyers to have membership into Krause House.\n\n### **DURATION**\n\nOnce passed, this proposal will remain active indefinitely or if another proposal is passed to be an addendum to this.",

      "title": "Funding for KH Capsule Collection",
      "content": "Authors: whereisomar, fetti\n\n---\n\n### Proposal\n\n- We are requesting $960 from the treasury to fund a limited production run of 48 KH Capsule T-shirts to be sold at NFT NYC.\n\n---\n\n\n\n### Context\n\n- The Merch Team holds the perspective that merchandise is a key lever for the DAO in growing membership and building brand affinity and engagement.\n- In the spirit of experimentation and conducting initial tests of this hypothesis, the team developed two collections with two different primary audiences in mind:\n    - **KH Essentials:** The primary audience is internal – current members of the DAO looking for gear to wear out and share their KH pride\n    - **KH Capsule:** The primary audience is external – folks who may not be as familiar with Krause House or web3 for that matter but have an appreciation for good design, high fashion, and recognize the NYC and basketball cultural elements referenced in the piece\n- This first limited merchandise is effectively a brand-building exercise and not a revenue-generating one to build the Treasury. That said, we expect, at a minimum, to break even and more likely to turn a small profit. Krause House will keep 100% of the profit.\n- **This proposal is to fund a limited production run of the KH Capsule T-Shirt to have available for sale onsite at KH events during [NFT.NYC](http://nft.nyc/) (June 21-23). The t-shirt will also be made available for sale online on a pre-order basis via the same Shopify site that will host the KH Essentials items.**\n\n---\n\n### **Capsule Collection**\n\n[https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aWZ4tPYHxG6f9a1z1xQwf9OfVZwmWgX14i6661Ljxwoz8l9MOJeD4DRX6EwJ0R3SPUXyba00bSTSVE899W9Fv8ztihsw7hpuu6M7K0KllC_4I8iqAmqqnKuXlE2dbgWoFwg5dVGiUejFBRj36w](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/aWZ4tPYHxG6f9a1z1xQwf9OfVZwmWgX14i6661Ljxwoz8l9MOJeD4DRX6EwJ0R3SPUXyba00bSTSVE899W9Fv8ztihsw7hpuu6M7K0KllC_4I8iqAmqqnKuXlE2dbgWoFwg5dVGiUejFBRj36w)\n\n[https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/a2n-JfGaNvcW4rL1XEnEnpdeC8yOByeOg6nT6KOuB5Vpd8BGkOsROmZPfSrGEj4RslCcF0uRncrFG_jfeEKrrRG2cgR_M2uqXwDiRd9F7oaIpH4sv1O2eDC6Ok4DvcBXEa-8mRVuNSKSvnlwKA](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/a2n-JfGaNvcW4rL1XEnEnpdeC8yOByeOg6nT6KOuB5Vpd8BGkOsROmZPfSrGEj4RslCcF0uRncrFG_jfeEKrrRG2cgR_M2uqXwDiRd9F7oaIpH4sv1O2eDC6Ok4DvcBXEa-8mRVuNSKSvnlwKA)\n\nTitled, “The Tip-Off”, we partnered with a NYC-based streetwear designer to deliver a piece that both commemorates NYC’s rich basketball heritage as well as memorializes the NFT NYC 2022 moment.\n\n**Small details to highlight:** For those familiar, you’ll notice the famous NYC Parks leaf logo at center court, a staple image at public courts throughout the city. Additionally, we would like to point out the unidentifiable faces in the stands. We wanted to lean into the anonymity culture of web3 and crypto but demonstrate how that can evolve over time. Some of the faces are black and have their identities fully obscured from the public while others are purple and though still anonymous, by demonstrating their affinity towards KH, they become identifiable at least by this one marker in the sea of blank faces. Lastly, fans closer to the action on the court more vibrantly shine their KH purple and are more luminous — illustrating they’re ready to get in the game.\n\n| Item | Category | Units | Production Costs | Fulfillment Costs | Total Costs | Retail Price | Revenue | Profit |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Capsule T-Shirt | KH Capsule | 48 | 18 | 2 | 960 | 60 | $2,880 | $1,920 |",

      "content": "---\n\n**WALLET:** `0x5e26CDF0c9660ccf797C3D6cda7a21Ce4e5D2f69`\n\n**AUTHOR**: The_Lazy_W\n\n---\n\n### Proposal\n\n- $1,800 USDC and 200 $KRAUSE Per Month\n- 6 Months\n- 16 Hours of Work\n\nPaid monthly.\n\nStewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.\n\nCommunity may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nLazy W is requesting a budget in order to build and develop the podcast media efforts already in place and develop a network of podcasts that share the Krause House ethos, creative sensibilities, and will help bring awareness to the Krause House mission, attract new members, and cultivate content that will solidify credibility in the larger sports and Web3 community, create new revenue streams through advertising sales, merch, exclusive offerings, and NFTs.\n\nLazy W has experience working with one of the most reputable podcast studios specializing in original content creation, monetization, and audience development.\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS:**\n\nKrause House rests on the idea that web3 enables a better operating model for sports franchises. To demonstrate and leverage this improved approach, we must build a content network that expands our reach, brings in new members, and legitimizes our efforts throughout the larger community.\n\nKrause House is has done a great job establishing a foundational audience for their three shows. Despite the podcast being one of the top sources for demand generation, there is still a lot of opportunity to grow the network. Additional content, across more channels can be a great way to continue to grow the community and raise awareness for our mission. There is also a substantial  revenue opportunity to generate revenue by partnering with sponsors that are aligned to our goals. Moreover, creating an ad network to increase revenue streams and attracting additional shows would help cement Krause House as one of the foundational media outlets for the crypto & sports markets.\n\nBasketball fans are the highest active podcast listeners in the US. 32% of basketball fans listen to at least one show per week( [https://sport.yougov.com/podcasts-which-sports-fans-are-listening/](https://sport.yougov.com/podcasts-which-sports-fans-are-listening/)). Crypto-based audio programs remain to be one the fastest growing categories in the podcast space. Krause House has an opportunity leverage these macro trends by adopting a stronger, more widespread podcasting strategy. \n\n**MILESTONES / OBJECTIVES**:\n\n*To be completed before the end of the year*\n\n- Develop and greenlight 3 podcasts related to sports, crypto, or the intersection of both to be ready for launch by or before end of year\n    - Possible Shows\n        - WBNA\n        - Big3\n        - Sports Collectibles and Wagering\n- Organize a live podcast event\n- Book a Krause House representative on three separate sports or crypto related podcasts\n\n**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\n1. Research potential opportunities across new shows, sponsors, and bookings\n2. Develop strategy advertising network across KH podcasts\n3. Draft treatments and development materials for potential new shows\n4. Meet with sports/crypto experts to identify potential host talent\n5. Identify and secure a location for a live event and develop a marketing strategy to raise awareness and sell tickets to event\n\n**ADDITIONAL INFO:**\n\nThe current team has created multiple podcasts with hopes to develop a larger network of shows that will trigger increased engagement and awareness of Krause House’s mission. Lazy will set clear objectives regarding audience engagement, creating a revenue model, and developing metrics to measure success in reaching these goals. We hope to build out a larger team and drastically increase our output capability in the coming months.\n\nAdditional funding may be needed for new experimental projects the team decides to take on, including launching new shows, securing studio space, paying for engineers and other production staff, hiring new talent, and any efforts to get Krause House reps featured on pre-existing shows outside of the KH network.",

      "content": "Place description of KrauseHouse DAO and interview with Founders in high-quality print magazine about legal innovation and the future of law. \nAuthor: Bitkorni\n\n# Context:\n\nWe have the chance to place Krause House in a German high-quality print magazine about legal innovation and the future of law ([https://rethinking-law.com/](https://rethinking-law.com/)). The magazine in question has a readership of roughly 2000 subscribers and is sold in shops all over germany. Readers are a bunch of lawyers interested in tech-innovation and some politicians. If we reach a basketball-fan lawyer, it might lead to a really helpful/valuable contributor.\n\nThe publication will definitely lead to KrauseHouse gaining reputation with people close to the subject. It can be useful when approaching possible partners or teams as a \"stamp of legitimacy\" and great a reputable intro for German speakers. I might be able to get the rights for the interview to publish it ourselves a little after the magazine comes out.\n\nIf the content is produced, I can guarantee it to be in the next issue on DAOs that will be published in August 2022. The content can be in English, but is preferred to be in German. I would suggest writing a two-to-three page description about the KrauseHouse and its origin story in German and conduct a long interview with Flex or Commodore that will be printed in English.\n\nThe work has to be finished by the 30th of June.\n\n# Scope of Work:\n\n1. Write 2-3 page KrauseHouse Project Description as Introduction to #WAGBAT\n2. Conduct and record a 2 hour interview with one of the Founders\n3. Transcribe and edit the interview\n4. Get approval and final edit\n5. Edits after feedback from the publisher\n6. Get published\n\n# Comp:\n\nRecipient: bitkorni + transcriber\n\nOverall: 950 $KRAUSE + 600 $USDC\n\n1. 150 $KRAUSE + 150 $USDC for German intro\n2. 300 $KRAUSE for conducting the interview\n3. 300 $USDC for transcribing and editing the interview\n    1. Can be split\n        1. 200 $USDC for transcription\n        2. 100 $USDC for editing\n4. 500 $KRAUSE Reward for Publication\n    1. + 250 $USDC for mention on the Cover",

Future work will be as-needed for maintenance and enhancements and funded monthly.**\n\n**PROJECT LEADS:** Boogieman#9971\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:** \n\nI will be building an easily digestible dashboard of aggregated KH transaction history with internal notes that anyone can view and interact with.  The dashboard will be updated and maintained by a shared Google Sheet containing all Etherscan transactions on KH wallets.\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS:**\n\nTransaction transparency is important for DAO members. Etherscan lacks context of why a transaction took place or was approved and can be hard to understand even when that information is available.\n\n**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\nAggregating all transaction data from KH wallets on an excel sheet by providing tabs where updated transaction data can be pasted and automatically compiled with other transaction types on a master sheet that includes KH transaction notes when provided. \n\nThe aggregated master sheet will connect to a Google Data Studio dashboard that is automatically updated as the transactions are added to the Google Sheet.\n\nThis document will sit in within Notion embedded & linked. The Google Data Studio is superior to the Notion document due to examining the associated transactions details. \n\n**DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:**\n\nDeliver a functioning and easily manageable V1 dashboard that can be maintained by a shared sheet and updated by anyone proficient in Excel or Google Sheets. \n\n**DETAILS:**\n\nCommodore will commit to keeping this up-to-date by “books close” (10th of each month) while retained under his full-time contributor compensation.\n\nFunding requested is 7hrs of the 10+hrs work already completed at $120/hr.\n\nBoogieman is willing to maintain the document at a compensation of 3-6/hrs month pending updates or enhancements needed at $120/hr.\n\nBoogieman#9971",

See the model [here](https://github.com/marcoloco23/super_team).\n\n### Why\n\nBuilding a library of Krause House-sponsored published research and analytics tools will help KH gain a reputation as a capable operator of basketball teams. Furthermore, the timing with the potential Big3 acquisition will give marco a chance to try these tools in a very real context.\n\n### **Scope of Work**\n\n*A stream request is designed to give contributors freedom and encouragement to work across multiple domains across the DAO; however, here are the current main focuses / intentions:*\n\nI trained a machine learning model using data from over 10000 games to predict which set of players will win a game based on the statistics of these individual players. This allows generating custom teams and matching them up against each other to see who would win. Now the goal is to further explore and improve on this idea while building useful applications and tools that allow users to interact with these models as effortlessly as possible.\n\nIntention:\n\n- Build and explore basketball analytics models and applications to better communicate their findings\n\nPossible Applications:\n\n- A draft class explorer that can suggest players to draft from the perspective of any given team\n- A trade finder that can explore different potential trades and identify the best fit for a team\n- An MVP tracking tool\n- A basketball game prediction tool\n- A player/team development tool that can explore a player's or team's evolution over time.\n\nPotential Use Cases:\n\n- Enable Krause House to build an analytics platform around these models\n- Build a basketball analytics web app where users would be able to get advanced insights into upcoming games, fantasy teams, MVP predictions, etc.\n\n---\n\n### Specification\n\nThis contributor may submit a request for *up to* the specified amount based on self-assessment of their work.\n\n### Intention\n\nThis is intended to encourage contributors to take immediate action on a wide range of problems/opportunities, as opposed to proceeding through the slower process of submitting a proposal for a narrow scope of work.\n\nWe prefer to invest in and groom talent, giving *them* the freedom and capital they need to be entrepreneurs within our community.  We value self-starters who are able to take action and deliver quality work.\n\n### bUt SomEb0dY m1gHt t@kE t0o mUçh\nBoth the community and the Stewardship team has the power to cancel this stream if it is being abused.  In addition, if a contributor abuses this trust, they are effectively burning their social credibility and ability to successfully submit proposals in the future.  We expect some lossiness; however, we believe the benefits of getting good work off the ground is worth this small cost.",

Project Leads: **12,000 $KRAUSE**  \nIn Phase 2 our committee will have 4 assigned roles with preset compensation.  Re-distribution within the committee will be encouraged.\n    - Project Lead (3000 $KRAUSE)\n    - Committee Operations  & Communications Lead (3000 $KRAUSE)\n    - Business Entity Structure & Formation Lead (3000 $KRAUSE)\n    - European Franchise Opportunity Lead (3000 $KRAUSE)\n2.

International franchise ownership will be an important asset in onboarding new fans to Krause House, expanding our community of investors/token holders and will allow us to offer unique experiences to Krause House community members in cities around the world. \n2. Once established a global basketball fan following will have a vested interest in seeing Krause House succeed on our ultimate goal of “Buying an NBA team” #WAGBAT. \n\n### Deliverables\n\nAt the completion of Phase 2 (~60 days), we aim to: \n\n1. **Form a new legal entity (Possibly a SubDAO)** to address regulatory concerns related to Know Your Customer/Know Your Business securities regulations, and to address league and franchise concerns related to how our group will manage governance post investment as voting shareholders or via influence within the team's management office. \n2. **Outline and Establish a business model that will allow us to execute Web3 and Decentralized Sports Operations / Fan Engagement related work** for franchises globally by leveraging the capabilities of existing Krause House DAO committees and community members. \n3. **Negotiate & Recommend a path to acquire ownership stakes in international professional basketball franchises.** In exchange for our ownership stake, our committee will also negotiate a path to secure rights to execute web3, NFT, and DSO programs where applicable. \n\n### **What are the Goals of the International League Exploration Committee?**\n\nOur goals for Phase 2 are more tuned now that we have the experience of the last 3 months to draw from. \n\n- Going forward we aim to identify franchise ownership opportunities for Krause House in partnership with forward-thinking league offices, private equity & sources of capital and existing franchise managers that offer (1) Financial return for Krause House, and (2) the ability to execute our form of decentralized sports operations, web3, NFT, live streaming and metaverse programs.\n- We’ve seen broad interest globally in our operating model, web3 fundraising capabilities and alignment with our extended Krause House community. Partnering with the right international franchises represents an opportunity to position Krause House DAO as the leading community of basketball fans worldwide and the best place for fans who are interested in tokenized fan based team ownership to join in.\n\n### Previous Work: **Phase 1 Recap:**\n\nOur Phase 2 campaign is based on learnings outlined in our [Phase 1 Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xVfdIQSZGV54Us36s_lv_26wvzIbmwSCha-R-3CTBp4/edit?usp=sharing). In Phase 1 of the International League and Franchise Committee (ILEC) exploration we learned. \n\n1. *International basketball teams and ownership groups are open to investment but lack strategies for incorporating tokenized fan ownership, web3 and decentralized sports operations.* \n2. *Leagues and front office personnel remain skeptical regarding the governance and regulatory implications that come with accepting investment from a DAO.*\n3. *We encountered several private equity groups attempting to execute a similar strategy to Krause House. Experimenting with the ownership of an international pro-basketball franchise with a stated goal of NBA team ownership. These groups may be potential partners as we move forward.* \n\n### **Why Will we Succeed?**\n\nOur committee, currently at 10 people across 6 time zones and includes: \n\n•  An experienced former international basketball league executive, \n\n•  Former players (Professionals and NCAA D1) \n\n•  A Sports Agent \n\n•  A Marketing leader at one of the world’s leading sneaker companies, and \n\n•  2 Finance execs with experience raising capital from global investors and investing in technology based businesses \n\nCollectively, we’ve been able to credibly engage with the top managers, advisors and investors in international basketball. [See Phase 1 Report.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xVfdIQSZGV54Us36s_lv_26wvzIbmwSCha-R-3CTBp4/edit) In our Phase 1 exploration we established Krause House as a strong credible brand in the international basketball community. Executing on the goal of purchasing ownership stakes in one or eventually several international franchises, while raising the profile of Krause House internationally and in the US, seems entirely within our reach.",

      "title": "Purchase a Big3 team for $500k USDC",
      "content": "### What is being requested?\n\n- $500k USDC upfront for team purchase.\n\n### Why are funds needed?\n\nTo purchase a Big3 basketball team (specifically all 25 [Fire](https://big3.com/news/via-decrypt-ice-cubes-big3-basketball-league-to-offer-team-ownership-stakes-as-nfts/) NFTs to be sold for a single team). \n\n### Why would we buy this?\n\nKrause House is currently in its’ “credibility” phase, which is to prove credibility in decentralized sports ownership. This process has predominately been to acquire minority positions in major leagues & majority positions in international or alternative professional basketball leagues.\n\nThe Big3 falls into the latter category and offers us an opportunity to provide legal, operational, & financial mechanisms to build out credibility of our approach. Additionally, the Big3 leadership is committed to working closely with us as a DAO partner. \n\nKrause House will purchase all 25 of the Fire NFTs with the $500k USDC. There will be 975 Gold NFTs for our team, 500 of which we will control the whitelist for. The remaining 475 will be sold to the public / whitelists the Big3 will run. Gold NFTs will retail at $5k each, but for our whitelist they will be slightly discounted to $4,500 per Gold NFT. We are not required to purchase these, but our community will access if they choose to participate. Once the window closes, the remaining will be made publicly available. \n\n### What are the perks?\n\nFire NFTs each come with perks (like tickets to events and other access type perks). We’d also get royalty share (80%) on merchandise of the team. Governance would be limited, as Big3 prides themselves in being a player empowered league.\n\nAdditionally, the Big3 leadership team is committed to partnering with Krause House long term to scale their community building. KH would like to be involved as a DAO partner to assist with more DAO-oriented operations such as community, governance, & contributors. \n\n### How does this impact the average Jerry?\n\nAll details involving operations, access, & governance will still need to be determined. Generally speaking, we will build mechanisms to have Krause House Ticket Holders participate in aspects of the Big3 team purchased. Examples of this would be ways to engage our community & distribute free tickets to the games + other perks associated with the NFTs. Additionally, determining ways for us to bring helpful analytics and/or strategy to our team coach will need to be developed. \n\nAt a high level, this team will give us an experimental space to test components of our decentralized sports operations (more specifically merchandising & access). \n\nWe will create proposals for further distribution of access / perks to Krause House Ticket Holders. \n\n### How will I know this is executed properly?\n\nKH will send $500k USDC to the Big3 in exchange for 25 Fire NFTs via their smart contract. \n\n### What happens if someone runs away with this budget?\n\nWe’ll be executing a smart contract with the Big3 to exchange $500k USDC for 25 Fire NFTs. Running away with the budget will not be possible if the smart contract is execute properly. \n\n---\n\n### Ownership\n\n![Untitled](https://i.postimg.cc/JhGP0hqb/1.png)\n\n![Untitled](https://i.postimg.cc/85v4dnxc/2.png)\n\n![Untitled](https://i.postimg.cc/R0yGHzs2/3.png)\n\n![Untitled](https://i.postimg.cc/6qLhg4WN/4.png)\n\n![Untitled](https://i.postimg.cc/kGdcTvdc/5.png)\n\n---\n\n### Perks\n\n> BIG3 announced an innovative, new approach to team ownership in professional sports. The league will introduce decentralized team ownership, providing fans with the chance to own a stake in the 12 teams in the BIG3. Fans will have two ownership options comprised of 1,000 editions - 25 Fire and 975 Gold.\n\nAll editions include voting rights towards team actions, priceless gameday experiences and VIP tickets to all games, and limited-edition team, league, and championship merchandise and memorabilia. Fire editions also include exclusive intellectual property and licensing rights to team names, logos, and merchandise as well as additional gameday activations.\n\n**Additional Ownership Benefits Include (among others):**\n\n● First Rights to Expansion Teams\n● Percentage of Future Team Sale\n● Championship Game Perks for Owners of Participating Teams, including Receiving\nChampionship Rings at Presentation Ceremony\n● Player and Coach Meet-and-Greets\n● Signed Fireball\n● Access to Team Practices and After Parties\n● Selection of Season Awards Such as Player of the Week, All-Star Teams, and Highlights\n● Strategy Calls with Team Coach and Captains\n● Weekly Referee Call\n● Multiple Calls with Co-Founders Ice Cube and Jeff Kwatinetz and Commissioner Clyde\nDrexler\n● BIG3 NFT’s\n> \n\n![Untitled](https://i.postimg.cc/br7jCMw5/a.png)\n\n![Untitled](https://i.postimg.cc/sxQrJysS/b.png)\n\n![Untitled](https://i.postimg.cc/ZY2Z59xL/c.png)\n\n![Untitled](https://i.postimg.cc/X75WGV26/d.png)\n\n![Untitled](https://i.postimg.cc/63QwynPM/e.png)\n\n---\n\n### DAO Partners\n\nFlex & Commodore have had lengthy conversations with the Big3 team (Jeff, Ice Cube, & Sean). They’re incredibly excited to work with Krause House & understand the importance of us partnering at a deeper level with scaling their community. We’re working on outlining a scope of what that looks like, but we may not have that completed before funds are due to close this deal. The Big3 is solely focused on successfully executing their NFT sale, so we will most likely need to take them at their word for this condition.",

      "title": "Contributor Compensation Budget Team",
      "content": "# Contributor Compensation Budget Team\n\n## Team\n\nDogstoevsky\n\nEli\n\n### Specification\n\nAbility to discretionally approve funding requests in Utopia:\n\n**Total Budget**\n\n- Up to 75000 USDC\n- Up to 75000 $KRAUSE\n\nRestrictions:\n\n- Stewards Team can reject any request from this team.\n- Stewards Team can revoke this team’s funding.\n- Community can revoke this team’s funding via proposal.\n\n### Use of Funds\n\nPay contributors in a variety of forms (bounties, streams, project funding) without going through the treasury proposal process to reduce the friction getting funding from the treasury.\n\nMaximum 30k USDC and $KRAUSE to be paid out in a single month. \n\n### Why?\n\nThe Treasury is meant to be a slow and thorough process to ensure safety best practices.  This increases the friction of getting funding, which in turn increases the friction to contribute.  This is an experiment in moving contributor and project funding to the subDAO level.\n\nSuccess for this project will mean: \n\n- Reduce risks for the DAO when funding contributors\n    - Being able to more generously “offer” streams without being punished by bad actors\n- Increase the number of regular contributors on streams (aim for 20 individually streamed contributors within 2 months)\n- Decrease the managerial overhead of certain projects to self-allocate funds within themselves using tools like Coordinape\n- Leveraging learnings from books like Reinventing Organizations and obligating contributors to give and receive feedback and learn from each other\n\n### How will this team operate?\n\n*INITIATE*\n\n- Contributors still submit a short proposal/CV/request to this team to become eligible to receive funds\n\n*COLLECT*\n\n- To actually collect funds, all contributors must submit Proof of Work and Peer Feedback at the end of each month with all significant work (eg. main work you did) “vouched for” by someone (who you ask first)\n \n_**Example: Dog’s PoW for march.**_\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1DGjyLXJhh1sCQIis27Xd_w3-ROuRlY-HkY5WF9-bmeg/edit\n\n\n - If you don’t have proof of work, you don’t collect. This puts the onus on the contributor which is the only way to maintain order and transparency at scale\n- Proof of Work proves that the work was done, it does NOT say anything about quality (beyond it being “passable”)\n\nThe point of this PoW is not to have a team GATE KEEPING PAYMENTS. It’s simply to ensure that some work was actually done (AKA prevent fraud)\n\nIn addition to the Proof of Work, you will need to include Peer Feedback. These peer reviews are a better indicator of qualitative performance\n\n- This is borrowed from Reinventing Organizations\n- Example: Peer Reviews for Dog (This is ANONYMOUS BECAUSE I DIDN’T ASK THESE PEOPLE FIRST IF I COULD SHARE THEM, BUT THEY’D HAVE NAMES ATTACHED NORMALLY)\n\n![Untitled (1).png](ipfs://QmNrkPooedR2UUtvDTpcYnApxckexBvMCV3ySs3YJ46mzj)\n\n*RENEW*\n\nBased on Proof of Work and Peer Feedback, a contributor will be eligible to continue their stream. \n\n**NOTE:** proof of work will be public, peer feedback will be kept between this budget team and the receiver of the feedback. \n\n### Larger Vision\n\nWe hope to see *multiple* budget teams emerge, each with their own niche/focus.  Contributors and projects can go to the relevant team.  This also allows us to run multiple experiments in contributor funding without any risk to the treasury itself, as the risk is localized to specific funding teams.  If the contributor cannot receive quick funding from a team, they can submit a proposal through the treasury.",

We will achieve this goal through multiple phases, dependent on the success of the last phase.\n\nIn phase 1 (this proposal), we are exploring the creation of a DAO2DAO NBA 2K league. This league would allow us to build and manage all aspects of a virtual team with real life players. Many of the decentralized sports operations concepts we employ throughout this venture will be tested in the virtual space, providing valuable data and feedback for remote fan engagement.\n\n#WAGBA(2K)T!\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS**:\n\n- Our esports efforts will enhance Krause House credibility and reputation within the NBA community\n- We expect future esports project phases to test KH developed remote fan engagement tools alongside decentralized sports management principles\n\n**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE**:\n\nWe plan to operate lean and utilize full-time Krause House contributors as our core team, gaining additional support from team members throughout the initial exploration phase of this project.\n\nCurrent roadmap:\n\n- Pre-Phase 1: March 10 - April 18, 2022 (Completed)\n- Phase 1: Begins April 18, 2022; esports exploration geared towards general vision + NFT NYC event planning\n- Phase 2: Begins TBD; includes KH x BLVKHVND esports event at OS NYC during NFT NYC, June 20-24, 2022\n\n\n",

      "content": "### Proposal\n\n**Funding Total:** \n\n$27,000 USDC // 10,000 $KRAUSE\n\n**Funding Breakdown:**\n\n- Core team\n    - @whereisomar, @fetti, @donsnacks\n    - 6,000 USDC / month ($24,000 USDC / 4 months)\n    - 10,000 $KRAUSE to be distributed through Coordinape Gift Circle determined by project leads\n- Fashion designer/Illustrator\n    - $3,000 USDC\n- Milestones:\n    - 10,000 additional $KRAUSE distributed to the contributing team if a current/former NBA player wears KH merch! Stewards team will determine eligibility. NBA player must be wearing KH merch from this collection by end of year (December 31, 2022).\n\n**Merch Team Responsibilities:**\n\n- Vendor evaluation and selection\n- Concept design ideation\n- DAO participation/vote coordination\n- Production management\n- Merchandise sale and delivery\n\n**Specification:**\n\n- This proposal **does not include production costs** as final concepts are still being designed and ultimately voted on by the DAO. Exact production costs will be presented in a subsequent proposal.\n- KH Treasury will front production costs and will receive 100% of revenue for the first production run.\n\n**Protections**:\n\nIf at any time during this project there is insufficient participation or there is likely to be a material change in the intended outcomes, the project lead(s) will proactively work with the Stewards Team to: reduce budget, adjust scope, or if it’s deemed to no longer fit the spirit and intent of the original proposal, gracefully wind down the project. At any point, the Stewards Team may terminate this project for violations of Jerry values. Members can at any time terminate this project by means of formal proposal duly passed by snapshot vote.\n\n---\n\n## **Detailed Proposal**\n\n### WEN MERCH?!\n\nOver the last couple of months, the core Krause House merch team, namely, @whereisomar, @fetti and @donsnacks, have been working on coordinating all of the efforts required to deliver Krause House’s first limited merchandise run in time for **NFT NYC (6/21/22 – 6/23/22)**. We’ve locked down a world class vendor with access to premium fabrics and materials. Members will have first dibs and will be able to pre-order merch (early June) as well as purchase IRL at NFT NYC.\n\nKH Merchandise for our first run include: t-shirts, athletic socks, mesh basketball shorts, hats, hoodies, headbands, and a jersey collab with Metafactory all leveraging the latest KH [**brand assets**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jmlHILvQ58G8Rn8ZD_GTH-JvDdLVwreC)! We’ve been using the merch channel to solicit community feedback and vote on what items ultimately get produced. [**Jersey vote**](https://mcnffge73ho.typeform.com/to/jIlsGBvP) is now live (April 7th deadline). We’ll be announcing the vote at KH Town Hall. \n\n- KH treasury will front production costs and will receive 100% of revenue for the first production run. The merch team has modeled several scenarios and anticipate a negligible profit or break-even outcome. In future production runs, we’ll experiment with different methods of compensation: $KRAUSE, USDC, XP, rev/share, etc.\n- This specific proposal is to fund the merch team and a subsequent proposal will come in a couple weeks with exact production costs.\n\n### **What has the Krause House Merch team been up to?**\n\nIn anticipation of NFT NYC in June 2022, the team has been working on the following:\n\n \n\n**Research:**\n\n- Held exploratory conversations with several vendor suppliers (e.g., Metafactory, Fancy, Degen Supply, Decentraland, etc.)\n- Developed an evaluative framework to analyze vendors based on a number of factors including: business model, access and/or ability to procure high-end materials, technical know-how, manufacturing partnerships, pricing, production capabilities and timeline.\n- Explored metaverse shopping, i.e., what does it look like to build a KH merch shop on Gather or Decentraland? (ongoing)\n\n**Operations:** \n\n- We created two categories of merchandise:\n    - **Essentials:** Include KH basics, uniform and everyday wear\n    - **Capsule:** Focuses on delivering a unique piece or pieces that commemorate NYC’s rich basketball heritage and memorializes the NFT NYC 2022 moment\n- Identified a NYC-based designer to develop the KH Essentials and Capsule collections\n    - Briefed the designer and are co-creating a mood board to inspire the designs\n- Working with the KH brand team for jersey concepts inspired by NY basketball culture\n- Partnering up with [**Metafactory**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zNbcOAC6KowCbenakdnrryu7JzG_F4Z-73Wj0gHa8ho/edit) to deliver jerseys by NFT NYC 2022\n\n**Logistics:**\n\n- Submitted [**formal RFQs**](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1ZwxyHZxutEH4RpY4i4oLMVzHoZ_YMWG5DXpYzRk1cuA/edit) to potential vendor partners\n\n### **So, what’s next?**\n\nWe are now waiting on our potential vendor partners to respond to our RFQs. Once we have those in-hand, we will be submitting a **subsequent proposal** that details the following:\n\n- Production details\n    - Items\n    - Budget\n    - Timeline\n    - Tax/Accounting\n- Designs\n    - We’ve briefed a NYC based designer and are waiting on Mood Boards. Once we have designs fleshed out the DAO will vote on what items get produced.\n    - We will be leveraging the latest KH [**brand assets**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jmlHILvQ58G8Rn8ZD_GTH-JvDdLVwreC?usp=sharing).\n- Fulfillment\n    - We intend to set up a Shopify store with 3PL so we can fulfill merch orders\n    - Merch team will have an IRL activation for NFT NYC\n\n**Scope of Work*:**\n\n*~~Vendor(s) selection~~ – **completed***\n\n*Design ideation – **in progress***\n\n*DAO participation/vote – **next step***\n\n*Production management – **next step***\n\n*Merchandise delivery and sale – **next step June 21-23rd.***\n\n**Note: This is intended to be a high-level illustration of the overall project’s steps. A subsequent proposal will be submitted for the production phase.*",

      "title": "Request for idle Treasury Assets to be staked on Bancor ",
      "content": "> **Note:** Proposal will be put up on Snapshot for voting, but Krause House DAO is waiting on the setup of a legal entity to execute this proposal should it pass on Snapshot.\n\n**FUNDING:**\n1. 1,000,000 USDC, 100 ETH and Insurance Cost of 3.6352 ETH to be staked.\n2. 6000 USDC of Contributor Funding\n\n**WALLET: Krause House Multi-Sig**\n\n**Authors:** 0xUST#2965 & Magnus#3558\n\n## **GOAL OF PROJECT:**\n\nStake `$1,000,000 USDC` and `100 ETH` on Bancor\n\nThe proposal will include the purchase of insurance cover from Unslashed Finance against Smart Contract Integrity for an amount of `420 ETH`. \n\n### Background\n\nBancor is the first decentralized trading protocol, empowering traders, liquidity providers & developers to participate in an open financial marketplace with no barriers to entry. No one needs permission to use the open-source Bancor Protocol.\n\n## WHY THIS MATTERS:\n\nThe treasury management space is quite nascent and presents a massive opportunity for projects to further monetize holding a token (specific to each project) - and there is no exception to this opportunity for Krause House DAO.\n\nWe’d like to declare the amount of funds that we would like to deposit into the Bancor Liquidity Pools. \n\nAt time of writing this proposal - Bancor Yields for the assets requested to stake, are currently providing:\n\n`ETH`: ~4.08% APR\n`USDC`: ~29.73% APR\n\nStaking these idle assets will allow the DAO Treasury to earn **~$309,197** on the USDC and ETH side.\n\nThe *Krause House DAO Treasury Management Strategy plays into the goals of generating yield to accomplish all goals listed in the above-stated plan. The BNT Token earned would be a valuable asset to the treasury as we would then be able to participate in the governance for one of DeFi’s most established protocols.* \n\nAll Yield generated would be added to the Krause House DAO Treasury. Providing additional funds to increase our runway - providing a more robust future for DAO Operations as we work towards our ultimate goal of acquiring an ownership stake in an NBA Team.\n\n## HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:\n\nThe *Krause House DAO Treasury Management Strategy plays into the goals of generating yield to accomplish all goals listed in the above-stated plan.*\n\nAs stated above, the plan is to utilize the strategy of deploying funds into:\n\n1. ETH/BNT LP - 100 ETH = ~$291,600\n    1. APR of:\n    ETH 4.08% | BNT 41.31% = ~$11,897 for providing ETH single-sided (paid in BNT, not including trading fees which are paid in ETH) | (Compound rewards received from adding ETH liquidity, by single-sided staking BNT, generating yield on the BNT liquidity provision)\n2. USDC/BNT LP - $1,000,000 USDC\n    1. APR of:\n    USDC 29.73% | BNT 44.53% = ~$297,300 for providing USDC single-sided (paid in BNT, not including trading fees which are paid in USDC) | (Compound rewards received from adding USDC liquidity, by single-sided staking BNT, generating yield on the BNT liquidity provision)\n\nThe total prospective yields that can be generated would equate to **~$309,197** on the USDC and ETH side. We can calculate the increased yield once the treasury engages in compounding the BNT rewards it would receive for providing the USDC & ETH liquidity given the BNT APR’s listed above.\n\nInsurance cover from Unslashed Finance will be purchased to cover the total value of `420` ETH deployment to the liquidity pools. \n\n## OTHER OPTIONS**:**\n\n**Stake 750,000 USDC & 75 ETH ($225,797) = $975,797**\n\nProspective base (annualized) yield would equate to: ~$232,987 (without factoring in BNT compounding)\n\n**Stake 500,000 USDC & 50 ETH ($150,531) = $650,531**\n\nProspective base (annualized) yield would equate to: ~$154,791 (without factoring in BNT compounding)\n\n## TIMELINE:\n\nMulti-Sig Holders to execute the strategy once proposal reaches quorum. \n\n## Treasury Managers:\n\nThe 2 primary managers of the currently idle treasury assets that would be deployed to Bancor, should the proposal pass, are both **Kris** (*0xUST#2965*) & **Magnus** (*Magnus#3558*)\n\n**Kris:**\n\n- Previously sat on investment team for a digital asset hedge & venture fund.\n- Lead emerging ecosystem research across Terra, Avalanche, Near, Fantom, Harmony, etc.\n- Specialized in catalyst-driven momentum trades + Market-wide DeFi analysis.\n- Has sat on the Bancor DAO Marketing Council since July of 2021 (non-paid contributor)\n\n**Magnus:**\n\n- Is deeply familiar with the DeFi Space - Started his Crypto journey in 2013.\n- Operates and manages his own Crypto-focused Prop Fund.\n    - Systematic Trading\n    - Early Stage Investments\n    - Advisory\n    - Yield Farming\n- Is a Co-Founder of a DeFi protocol called Redacted Cartel.\n\n## DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:\n\n- Krause House DAO Treasury to generate yield to add to treasury\n- Would add additional assets to Krause Treasury\n- Increase runway by putting idle assets to work\n\n## Transparency:\n\nKris & Magnus will work together to generate monthly performance reports to show increase in treasury asset value since inception (initial deposit of assets) which will primarily be denominated in $ growth.\n\n## Compensation:\n\nRequesting $6,000 USDC/mo for a 2 month trial period. This would be split 50/50 between Kris & Magnus for the duration of the 2 month trial period.\n\n## RISKS:\n\n- Smart contract risk\n- General downturn of the greater market and yields drop and slow the amount of yield being generated\n\n## RISK MITIGATION:\n\nIn the interests of mitigating against Smart Contract Risks. There is the additional option of buying Insurance Cover against Smart Contract Integrity for Bancor Network. This would cost a premium of **0.3898%/year** to purchase this cover for the desired amount of funds - Which would equate to 3.6352 ETH. \n\nThe added benefit of purchasing this insurance cover, we would also be farming `USF` (Unslashed Finance) Token, which in turn would be an additional asset to add to the Treasury.\n\nIf there is any cause of concern, the Stewards team may intervene and exit from the above-outlined strategies. \n\n## TEAM:\n\n- Kris\n- Magnus\n- Mario Lopes\n- Motif\n- Flex Chapman\n\n## Options:\nSelect all options you approve.  The higher amount with > 50% approval will be selected.\n- Stake 1,000,000 USDC & 100 ETH\n- Stake 750,000 USDC & 75 ETH\n- Stake 500,000 USDC & 50 ETH\n- Abstain\n- Do not stake any idle treasury assets",

The V2 will be focused on making it interactive: introducing micro tasks for different videos, using Gather rooms to make the learning experience more fun, and arranging hackathons that will be technical as well as non-technical for people to gain some hands-on knowledge.\n- Agents- Work on the Agents team onboarding new people to KH, build a feedback loop for KH Uni, and expand the content library from it.\n- MyJerry project- I will be helping with research and ops stuff in this project It will use PFPs, earn-able points for engagement (Jerry Points), and equip-able transferable and non-transferable wearables to gamify KH engagement, provide an avenue for enhanced partnerships and incentivize WAGMI Jerry behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Specification\n\nThis contributor may submit a request for *up to* the specified amount based on self-assessment of their work.\n\n### Intention\n\nThis is intended to encourage contributors to take immediate action on a wide range of problems/opportunities, as opposed to proceeding through the slower process of submitting a proposal for a narrow scope of work.\n\nWe prefer to invest in and groom talent, giving *them* the freedom and capital they need to be entrepreneurs within our community.  We value self-starters who are able to take action and deliver quality work.\n\n### bUt SomEb0dY m1gHt t@kE t0o mUçh\nBoth the community and the Stewardship team has the power to cancel this stream if it is being abused.  In addition, if a contributor abuses this trust, they are effectively burning their social credibility and ability to successfully submit proposals in the future.  We expect some lossiness; however, we believe the benefits of getting good work off the ground is worth this small cost.",

      "title": "Member Benefits Proposal Part 1: User Research",
      "content": "# Member Benefits Proposal Part 1: User Research\n\n## Background\n\nCurrently, there are two primary ways for members to gain access to the Krause House discord: having a Guest Pass as well as purchasing an NFT ticket off Rarible or Opensea. We want to build incentives into the NFT ticket such that newbies wanting to contribute to Krause House would prefer buying an NFT ticket vs getting a Guest Pass. If the NFT ticket only grants access to the Discord, it’s easy to see why newbie contributors would opt for a guest pass (free) vs the NFT ticket (floor is currently .06ETH, ~$200). NFT Ticket Member Benefits help KH with member acquisition, engagement, and retention.\n\nThis proposal is one of two parts: this will be focused on user research to figure out the community breakdown and what user personas make up the DAO. We’ll leverage these insights to provide intrinsic and extrinsic benefits that all Jerry’s can benefit from in the real world (more on this later, in the proposal Part 2). Additionally, we will ensure to conduct research on holders of the guest pass — what would make them want to buy an NFT ticket?\n\n### Team:\n\nWhereisomar: Agent, Partnerships, and Merch work\n\nViews: Agent and New Orleans Pelicans bid PM\n\nDog: Agent, Product, Ops\n\n## Funding\n\n- 3000 USDC\n- 3300 KRAUSE\n- 2 week duration\n\nThis funding will be used for the completion of a research report which will inform the NFT benefits strategy.\n\n## User Research\n\nInitial ideas for NFT ticket benefits include raffles for game tickets, basketball shoes, credit cards, healthcare, massages and other perks, but these are only good guesses for now – we need concrete data in order to proceed with providing benefits the community wants and needs.\n\nOur goal from user research is to eventually be able to answer the following questions:\n\n- How valuable would X incentive be for the Krause House community\n- What is the value in intrinsic benefits vs extrinsic?\n- What are the different Krause House personas and what are their wants and needs?\n- What is the low hanging fruit that will boost member satisfaction and engagement?\n- Are there a list of partnerships or perks that will help acquire new members and boost engagement from folks on the sidelines?\n- What is the current Net Promoter Score (NPS) score from Jerry’s and how do we improve our baseline?\n- Are there better ways to measure success and “Jerry Happiness”?\n- What would make someone who is currently on a guest pass to buy an NFT ticket?\n\nTo answer these questions, we will:\n\n1. Send out a survey to the Krause House community in the form of a Discord announcement, and incentivize completion of the survey with 100 KRAUSE to 3 randomly chosen members.\n2. Conduct at least 20 1-1 interviews\n\n## Short-term benefits\n\nAlong with user research, we will look to provide immediate benefits to NFT Ticket holders. This will be in the form of the Jerry / Rookie of the week getting an NBA game ticket / basketball shoes, as well as other other low-hanging fruit (more ideas to come!).\n\n## Future State\n\nPart 2 of the proposal will feature perks and benefits to explore. We will look to categorize benefits and pursue low hanging fruit that will drive the most value to Jerry’s over the next couple of months.\n\nOur vision is for the ticket benefits to provide access to a larger global community.  Potential ideas listed below:\n\n- IRL event access (events that KH puts on like in NFT NYC, Consensus events, MIT Sloan Sports analytics conferences)\n- Helping people with taxes, accounting\n- Healthcare (Opolis partnership)\n- IRL Fitness memberships\n- Digital Fitness sessions - Zoom workouts with trainer in our community\n- Discounts: KH merch, Uber eats, clothing (GOAT, StockX)\n- WL access to NFT drops\n- Guest speakers in the Discord channel\n- Raffle for NBA tickets\n- Discord Nitro subscription\n- Video games\n- Bundled Substack (premium subscriptions)\n- NBA league pass\n- Krause House branded Crypto.com credit card\n- Ability to have access to other communities in our accelerator\n- Philanthropy + Supporting youth leagues.

      "title": "V2 Ticket Migration",
      "content": "Author: greg, Mario\n\n# Summary\n\nIf passed, this proposal will initiate a migration from the current Mirror ticket NFTs to a V2 contract built by Krause House. All current holders will be able to exchange their tickets for the new tickets. No v2 tickets will be granted to those who do not currently hold a v1 ticket (1:1 supply).\n\nThe proposal requests *up to* 2 ETH to account for gas deployment costs, but the team expects this number to be much less and will submit transaction hashes for proof-of-spend post-deployment.\n\n# Timeline\n\nApril 13, 2022 - Deploy to Testnet\n\nApril 19, 2022 - Soft Launch (Unannounced)\n\nApril 21, 2022 - Official Migration Announcement and Launch\n\n# Why Now\n\nThe migration to our own ticket contract is inevitable to enable greater control over tickets’ use cases and increased interoperability with other in-house protocols. The project team believes this migration is better done sooner rather than later for the following reasons:\n\n1. Migrations can be messy, they’re easier the smaller the community is\n2. The Mirror contract can appear questionable to those looking to buy a ticket\n3. There are a number of upcoming projects hoping to use tickets as a unique user identity, this requires some custom functionality\n\n# Contract Details\n\nThe following will be used as acceptance criteria for the contract’s development:\n\n1. The contract is implemented through an upgradeable proxy owned by the treasury multi-sig\n2. The contract implementation conforms to the ERC1155 standard\n\nAll ticket types (Upper Level, Club Level, and Courtside) will be different token ids on the same ERC1155.\n\n# Migration Details\n\nMigration will be performed through a simple UI in which you connect your wallet, view the legacy ticket NFTs you have to exchange, click the exchange button, and confirm a transaction to exchange them. Any legacy NFTs held will then be burned and the new ones sent to your wallet.\n\nThe exchange will be done through another contract developed by the team, and the site will be hosted on a [krausehouse.club](http://krausehouse.club) subdomain to verify authenticity.\n\n# Migration Team\n\ngreg - Developer\n\nMario Lopes - Operations / Support",

      "title": "VO2 Whitelist Extension to KH Ticket Holders In Exchange For Marketing Support",
      "content": "Author: Arpan from VO2\n\n## **Intro to VO2**\n\n- VO2 is a project that will become the industry standard for how fans and athletes interact. Athletes create athlete tokens which are sold to fans on our platform, these tokens are NFTs that grant access to exclusive digital communities.\n- Within an athlete community, fans can rally around their favorite athlete: giving them input on what to wear and what to work on, competing against other community members to be the #1 fan, competing against other fanbases when one athlete community verses another, and earning rewards as the athlete does well.\n- Our vision is to bring fans and athletes closer together. Early fans should be rewarded for their support, all fans should be able to help athletes make decisions, and no athlete should have to become a social media influencer to engage their fanbase.\n\nWebsite: [https://www.vo2.fans](https://www.vo2.fans/)\n\nWhitepaper: [https://vo2.gitbook.io/oxy-live-whitepaper/](https://vo2.gitbook.io/oxy-live-whitepaper/)\n\n## Proposal\n\n*Goal:*\n\nThis proposal aims to kickstart a closer bond between the VO2 community and the Krause House community by extending the VO2 genesis NFT drop whitelist to the Krause House ticket holders.\n\n*Plan of Action:*\n\nVO2 will extend the NFT drop whitelist to all Krause House [Courtside/ Upper Level] ticket holders. Whitelisted buyers are enabled early-access to purchasing VO2 NFTs, and will be able to buy them at a 50% discount.\n\nKrause House will promote the VO2 NFT drop by doing the following:\n\n- One tweet highlighting the VO2 token drop and notifying Krause House ticket holders that they have access to the whitelist\n- Promoting the VO2 server link in the announcements and partnership channel while notifying Krause house ticket holders that they have access to our whitelist\n- One AMA with the VO2 founding team over Twitter Spaces for the Krause House community to ask questions about our project\n\n*Timeline*\n\nThe VO2 NFT drop will be conducted on April 4th, 2022. All Krause house ticket holders will receive whitelist access by joining our Discord and verifying ownership of their ticket before April 4th.\n\nKrause House will complete all promotion tasks at least a day in advance of April 4th, and should begin promotions with a Tweet starting 3/30.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nKrause House ticket holders have the ability to drive partnerships that contribute to the Krause House vision. We want Krause House ticket holders to be part of VO2’s initial community that guides our protocol, and we believe that VO2’s growth will only carry Krause House’s vision forward.\n\nOwnership of the VO2 NFT will allow token holders to vote on important decisions for the VO2 ecosystem such as:\n\n- What sports/ esports verticals should we target?\n- What specific athletes should we make a token for?\n- What features should we add to our product?\n\nVO2 NFT holders will also be granted whitelist spots to athletes they helped choose. For example, if you were involved in a post and green-lighted the addition of a UFC fighter to the platform, you would get whitelist access to that fighter. This will give Krause House ticket holders greater influence in the growing athlete NFT ecosystem.",

      "title": "Greg Full Time Funding",
      "content": "## TLDR\n\nIn April, greg will be stepping away from his current day job to hopefully begin contributing at Krause House full time. This proposal is to contract greg, with Krause House as his primary focus, for $12,000 USDC + 4,000 KRAUSE per month for 4 months.\n\nThe role can be summarized as “designing and developing the infrastructure and applications for tomorrow’s fan-controlled sport franchises”.\n\n## Qualifications\n\ngreg has worked as a full-stack developer for nearly 4 years. He has worked in web3 development for 9 months, working with DAOs such as CityDAO (prev. lead developer), Olympus DAO, and our very own Krause House.\n\nSome of his previous work (some of these are staging links, minting things will do nothing):\n\n- [https://citydao-frontend.onrender.com/](https://citydao-frontend.onrender.com/)\n- [https://analytics.krausehouse.club/](https://analytics.krausehouse.club/)\n- [https://joinscholarly.com/](https://joinscholarly.com/)\n- [https://roster.krausehouse.club/](https://roster.krausehouse.club/)\n- [https://krause-domains.web.app/](https://krause-domains.web.app/)\n\n## Day-to-Day Workflow\n\n- Developing both experimental and production-ready protocols and applications.\n- Meeting with stakeholders within target industries (sports management, sports media, content creation, etc) to understand where needs intersect with web3 value-adds.\n- Writing updates on explorations, development, and feedback on protocols and applications.\n- Exploring new web3 tools and tech to leverage within an NBA franchise.\n\n## The Role\n\nThis role is intended as highly focused building/prototyping/engineering time, and *not*\n management/leading of a dev team nor implementing systems for other teams/individuals.  I will work with other teams (ex: analytics), but the project direction will be ultimately be decided by me.\n\n**What this role will include if this proposal is passed:**\n\n- Developing web3 systems and protocols for true fan ownership and operation of professional sports teams, most especially for basketball.\n- Uncovering new approaches for NBA teams to generate revenue and provide value to their fans.\n- Researching and designing these systems with the help of high-context individuals within the industry.\n- Proactively strategizing where the future of the NBA lies and positioning Krause House’s offerings to align with that future.\n- Purchasing an NBA team with all the other Jerry’s.\n\n**What this role will not include if this proposal is passed:**\n\n- Acting as “Dev team lead”\n- Marketing developed systems to teams or the broader public\n- Initiating partnerships with teams, players, and organizations\n- Developing internal DAO tooling\n- Recruiting and onboarding\n- Day to day management of developers\n\nI’ve put a lot of thought into where my strengths and weaknesses lie within the context of Krause House and our goal to own and operate an NBA team. I have also spoken with a number of Stewards and other high-context individuals within the DAO, and believe the perspective reflected in this proposal to be an objective evaluation of how I can best impact Krause House.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n**Initially...**\n\n- Demos of experimental web3-based value-adding protocols for use within an NBA franchise\n- Reports detailing where web3 can and cannot improve an NBA franchise’s revenue, operations, and fan engagement\n\n**Then...**\n\n- Fan NFTs, team tokens, on-chain team ownership, and other products for fan-owned teams",

We will ensure all new brand assets are stored in a common location that all KH members can access.  Additionally, provide usage document (brand styleguide) enabling internal and external designers to work with our assets properly.  Basic assets will be stored in an easy to find and navigate location (notion / google drive).  We will also utilize Figma to host assets for those that are more design-oriented and know how to use that platform.\n\nWe will work with the various teams to update any and all touchpoints (website, social, podcasts, etc) to ensure a consistency across our brand assets.   We would pay bounties for larger projects (web for example) but otherwise expect this to be quite seamless.\n\nGoal 2: Build an internal design team / bounty system\n\nLead: dluxe  Support: bigbully\n\nKnowing that constantly using external agencies can be expensive, we need to now consider how to in-house some design work.  A $5K USDC budget is being asked here to pay designers for their work.  We will utilize the existing dework bounty tool, create a Design section within it and manage requests. Ideally we can figure out a core group of design contributors and deliver a system that is more sustainable when new assets are needed.\n\nGoal 3: Brand Launch @ NFT NYC\n\nLead: dluxe / bigbully / AK\n\nWork closely with merch + event teams to put forth a strong brand visual presence at NFT NYC in June.  This would include support on all brand work, delivering new assets and helping to make sure the overall presence is “on brand”.  Currently, bigbully, dluxe & AK are planning on attending in person to also support any needs that may come during the event.\n\nGoal 4: Trademarks and IP\n\nLead: bigbully support: AK\n\nBegin to understand the process for trademarking and legally protecting our brand assets and IP from a DAO perspective.  This might be quite easy or difficult, this season is just to investigate it and prepare a plan to move forward.  Would need support from internal legal support or externals.\n\n**FUNDING DETAILS:**\n\nWe would like to propose that these tasks and oversight be included in the Season 3 Branding project with compensation of 4000 $KRAUSE and $4000 USDC per month. This allocation of $KRAUSE and USDC would be distributed from the multisig to contributors based on their monthly completion of tasks and their completion of deliverables using the tools created after the completion of the project. Additionally, we are requesting $5000 USDC for asset development in a bounty-type system.  \n\n**REVERSIBILITY:**\n\nVeto rights remain with the Stewards Team on a monthly basis if work is not done to completion or there is a significant change in plans.\n\n**TEAM:**\n\nAcross the team is a unique blend of passion for Krause House, Web3, and the NBA as well as a combined 30+ years of experience in brand marketing, product development, and entrepreneurship. With this leadership team and the added effort of other talented Jerry’s, we are well-positioned to launch our brand to the next level!!!",

      "content": "**TITLE: Gas reimbursement plan for multi-sig transactions**\n\n**WALLET:** The wallet of the gas spender\n\n---\n\n**GOAL OF PROJECT:**\n\nFor each of our multi-sig transactions, one signer has to pay gas out of their personal wallet to complete the transaction. This proposal is to have a process in place to reimburse the gas of the signer.\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS:**\n\nEach transaction that the multi-sig needs to execute needs to pay gas. The way that Gnosis Safe works is that the last signer pays the gas out of their signing wallet. There is not a simple way for the Gnosis Safe to pay for the gas. We should optimize for getting important transactions completed rather than worry about personal gas expenditures.\n\nHaving a clear & consistent process to reimburse gas fees will reduce any blockers to getting things done in Krause House.\n\n**HOW THIS WILL WORK:**\n\nWhomever pays the gas for the transaction on the Gnosis Safe will be reimbursed for the exact amount of ETH spent on the transaction. This amount will be reimbursed on a monthly basis, regardless of the price of ETH.\n\nAn example would be if wallet 0x01 signs a transaction on the behalf of our Gnosis Safe and pays 0.1 ETH in gas. 0x01 wallet would receive a reimbursement of 0.1 ETH the following month.\n\n**FUNDING DETAILS:**\n\nThis proposal can't have a set budget because the amount of gas to be spent is unknown. However, it should be a small percentage of each transaction the Gnosis Safe will be executing. Additionally, this gas must be paid in some manner — this cost is not avoidable if we're doing transactions on mainnet.\n\n**TEAM:**\n\nCommodore will be responsible for tracking and reimbursing the signers that are eligible for reimbursement.\n\n**TRACKING:**\n\nA Google Sheet will be created tracking each Gnosis Safe transaction to a corresponding log for payouts of gas. \n\n**OTHER RESEARCH OR NOTES:**\n\nThere have many transactions signed since the NFT sale, we would like to include the transactions since the creation of the NFT sale (11/19/21). It should be noted, there are more transactions from before that time period — but there was no treasury at the time, we've omitted these transactions from this proposal.",

The Mets are a forward thinking organization partnering with the above mentioned pair ([https://metsbasketball.com/news/guaynabo-mets-sign-two-players-announce-new-crypto-partnership/](https://metsbasketball.com/news/guaynabo-mets-sign-two-players-announce-new-crypto-partnership/)).\n\nDerrick presented us the opportunity to sponsor an event for the team.  This is both a sponsorship opportunity, but largely an opportunity to establish roots via partnerships.  We hope to use this opportunity to send 3-5 Krause House delegates to hang out.\n\n### Krause House Delegates\n\nThey have 3-5 slots open for current Krause House members to join in the event (especially those who like to play basketball).  Members going are founders of FWB, QuickNode (web3 aws), Bitski, NBPA Advisors, as well as former pro athletes and creators now working at Coinbase, DAOLabs, and VCs.",

Enhance our partnership with BLVKHVND dsports org and build our presence on Twitch, YouTube, and social media sites\n- International League Exploration - project management support to our talented team working toward owning and operating a decentralized sports organization. Continue responsibilities from Phase I of this project\n- Agents on-boarding - provide a best-in-class onboarding experience by bringing new Jerry’s into the DAO and getting them aligned with our mission, values, and goals. Weekly POAP creation for Draft Night and continued communication with draftees\n- Metaverse - build our presence, specifically through Gather, with KH branded maps and original assets. Support KH events. Support potentially other metaverses & activities. I’m often found sitting at my desk in KH Gather, come say hi and co-work with me!\n- Dev - Intern to the Dev team; help design and make POAPs/NFTs for events and our organization.

This retainer will be used by the agency to front expenses for their team to act immediately and get the necessary pieces in place for NFT NYC week. Another proposal will be passed to finalize the selection of the agency and the scope they’re operating under.\n\nPROJECT LEADS: dbag#3251 (coordinator)\n\nOther Contributors: dbag will be reporting to Flex Chapman & Mario Lopes (both ineligible for any comp in this proposal)\n\n\nSUMMARY:\nAssigning a coordinator to champion the planning of NFT NYC from start to finish for NFT NYC IRL handling scope of partnerships, experiences, showcases, and gatherings.\n\nGOAL OF PROJECT:\nGoal of NFT NYC:\nOne of the largest crypto conferences in the world is NFT NYC. NYC is the mecca for attention. To create positive media attention, Krause House can create a one-of-a-kind IRL experience for attendees and can create an initiative to give back to Charity. This could lead to more global exposure → new members + new partners.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS:\nTo give Krause House a physical presence at NFT NYC and give the community another way to engage + bring exposure to people that are new to web3 and Krause House.\n\nTime is most important here to lock in a venue, partners, and vendors ASAP. Super important as NFT NYC venues are getting booked quickly.\n\nNFT NYC Dates: Tue, Jun 21, 2022 – Thu, Jun 23, 2022\n\n\nHOW THIS WILL BE DONE:\nFinalize NFT NYC framework/scope and use the community to help choose the specific elements to plug and play into the framework\nHire agency to plan logistics / event.\n\nInitial Vision:\n- Loft HQ (an AirBnb or hangout area) for KH throughout the week for community members and team to pop in and out\n- Main event @ a basketball court for an interactive experience\nEvents being explored include:\n- Creator Classic with basketball influencers\n3v3 Tournament\n- Breaking a basketball Guinness World Record as a community\n- Setting up a Krause House HQ for the week\n\nCoordinator will then hire an agency capable enough to execute the vision of the coordinator for this experience. Coordinator will be responsible to oversee agency and external partners in planning logistics and curating the event.\n\nFor this, we propose two required budgets - one for the coordinator and one for the agency retainer\n\n\nCoordinator Budget:\nScope: From proposal passing → June 25th (~ 4months) = $10,000 = $2500/Month. Budget will go towards time spent to curating the scope of the NFT based on what the community demands and executing on the vision + closing partners/sponsors for NFT NYC.\nAgency Retainer Budget:\n\nFrom experience and after interviewing a few different agency options the average agency retainer budget we are seeking to be pre-approved is $15,000. This retainer will be used by the agency to front expenses for their team to act immediately and get the necessary pieces in place for NFT NYC week. Another proposal will be passed to finalize selection of agency and scope they’re operating under.\n\n\nEvent Budget Breakdown Estimate:\n\nLocation: 30k\n3rd Party Counsel (Marketing, Legal): 15k\nEvent Vendors: 20k\nInstallations + Partnerships: 40k\nGiveaways + Prizes: 10k\nContent Team: 10k\nTotal: 150k\n\nDisclaimer: The coordinator and agency budget has been fixed but the event budget is an over-estimate. Our goal is to stay as lean as possible and spend less that six figures.\n\n\nTEAM:\ndbag#3251 - Has experience in curating intimate activations and pop-up experiences meant for high engagement and interaction. He has built a marketplace for a pop-up experience that essentially was a repository of venues and talent so he can navigate through negotiating the right deals and extract the best out of space and talent to curate a cohesive and welcoming experience. He now currently manages a couple of venues that have catered to productions and events.(https://riseabove.smugmug.com/PRODUCTION-STUDIOS/DOWN-TOWN-VIBES-STUDIO/)\n\nExample projects:\n\nKevin Hart, Superbowl commercial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tYrXkw6sYk),\nLarry June & Swizz Beatz (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV6dQRjE7Ek),\nBaiju Bhatt (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9D42WN5dIs),\nDon’t Tell Comedy (https://www.instagram.com/p/CSpqY8ohMBR/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link)\nSo Far Sound (https://www.instagram.com/p/CaP1xUlOi0n/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link), and many others.\n\nCLAUSE:\nBoth the community and the Stewardship team have the power to cancel the payment if this project does not deliver what is outlined above. In addition, if a contributor abuses this trust, they are effectively burning their social credibility and ability to successfully submit proposals in the future.

Improve the team’s top of funnel exposure (marketing), improve Guest Pass management, and follow up with projects post Snapshot approval with onboarding onto our various tools. \n\nWHY THIS MATTERS:\n\nThe onboarding team has done a great job with the new joiners we get to the server. Now we’d like to help **increase** the number of new joiners to the server while improving the way we set up projects and guest contributors for success. \n\nHOW THIS WILL BE DONE:\n\nCommunity Agent duties previously included: \n\n1. Moderate #introduce-yourself and #public-chat discord channels. (7hrs/week)\n2. Engage in 1-on-1 calls with people (5hrs/week of availability)\n3. Host a weekly Draft Class call for new joiners & existing members (1-2/hrs week)\n4. Train new agents\n\nNow we are adding new duties as follows:\n\n1. CRM Management of Guest Passes (guest discord access) (+30 mins/week)\n2. Reaching out to everyone that comes into our intake form (+2hrs/week)\n3. Add a weekly Draft Class for European time zone (+1hr/week)\n4. Helping address support tickets on Discord (+30 mins/week)\n\n## CRM Management and Guest Passes\n\nTrack temporary guest passes given out to people. Follow up when required. Do not let stagnant guest passes dilute actual contributors’ or NFTs. \n\nWe currently have some Guests absolutely slaying it, but a lot don’t. Which is fine, but they cannot retain the same benefits as everyone else for no help building the DAO. \n\n## Airtable Form Outreach\n\nReaching out to everyone who submits into our onboarding form. Sending them a courteous message and seeing if there’s any way for them to contribute. \n\n## Support Tickets\n\nWe have a support ticket system in the KH Discord and Agents will help with member questions\n\nWHAT THE TEAM HAS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED (in the last month):\n\nOnboarding team in the last two months: \n\n- Has had dozens of 1-on-1 calls turn into new contributors, including those who received Guest Passes.\n    - Notable new joiners:\n        - boosh\n        - donsnacks\n        - clivespace\n        - djelkin\n        - coach nick\n        - vgfc\n- Hosted Draft Classes each week (8 total) with an average of 10 brand new jerry contributors and 15 total participants.\n- Our #introduce-yourself channel responds to every new person that joins and often within an hour.\n\nFUNDING DETAILS:\n\n8k USD and 7k KRAUSE per month for two months managed in a multi-sig by the Project Leads\n",

      "content": "---\n\nInitiating a decentralized investment operations practice at Krause House\n\n**FUNDING: 10,000 $KRAUSE per month for two months.**\n\n**PROJECT LEADS: Lewwwk#4227**\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:** \nDecentralized operations is a core competency of Krause House. We are applying that competency to the investment activities of KrauseHouse. This project will establish the foundations of a Decentralized Investment Operations (DIO) practice at KrauseHouse and set the foundations for a Krause House Venture Fund.\n\n**GOAL OF PROJECT:**\n\nThe goal of this project is to establish and test initial DIO practices for running a Krause House Venture Fund. \n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS:**\nAs Krause House brings decentralization into professional sports ownership and operations, there is significant room for innovation across all of sport. Being able to invest in that innovation is an important contribution toward making our mission and vision possible, while also providing additional treasury diversification opportunities. Finally, establishing better practices for investment operations will also improve our ability to scalablely enable community acquisition of teams everywhere.\n\n**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\nWe will run two monthly sprints to establish and test decentralized investment operations for a venture fund across the following areas:\n\n- Sourcing\n- Opportunity analysis\n- Investment decision making\n- Portfolio support\n\nAt the end of each month, Lewwwk will run a coordinape give circle with all contributors to determine the allocation of that month’s 10,000 $KRAUSE budget.\n\n**DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:**\n\nThis project will be a success if it can demonstrate minimal viable investment practices that work in a decentralized context and have resulted in at least:\n\n- 1 venture sourced\n- 1 venture investment decision making cycle completed\n- 1 venture supported\n- 1 venture fund created\n\nWe will look to provide basic documentation around each of these practices.\n\n**TEAM:**\n\nThis sprint will be led by Lewwwk with the support of a growing roster of Jerrys. \n\nIn a recent survey to start building a roster of DIO talent we received 42 responses, the majority of whom are currently active investors. 95.2% of all respondents were interested in participating in the DIO.\n\nSpecific Jerry’s signing on to this sprint:\n\n- bS#5827\n- iggy_gl#0929\n- @tallman#4718\n\n**PROTECTIONS** \n\n- If at any time during this project there is insufficient participation or there is likely to be a material change in the intended outcomes, the project lead(s) will proactively work with Stewards and/or Core Team to:\n    - reduce budget,\n    - adjust scope, or\n    - if it is deemed to no longer fit the spirit and intent of the original proposal, gracefully wind down the project.\n- At any point Stewards or Core Team may terminate this project for violations of Jerry values\n- Jerrys can, at any time, terminate this project by means of formal proposal duly passed by snapshot vote.",

      "title": "Decentralized Sports Operations (DSO) Project Funding",
      "content": "---\n**FUNDING:** Up to 3,000 $Krause / month for 2 months\n\n**WALLET:**  Brandan will keep track of work in Notion on an ongoing basis that will drive the payment amounts. Brandan will enter appropriate payment amounts and wallet addresses into Utopia for distribution monthly. \n\n**PROJECT LEAD:** Brandan\n\n**Other Contributors:** Samir, Tag, Peter, Ebursa, Drew\n\n---\n\n**GOAL OF PROJECT:**\n\nDevelop the thought leadership and experimentation within Krause House to become the worldwide thought leader in the decentralized sports operations sector. We look at this from two perspectives - 1)  What does it mean to run a decentralized sports organization if we’re a majority owner? 2) What is the KH value prop to existing teams to bring KH onto the cap table as a minority owner?\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS:**\n\nKrause House is a globally distributed DAO and has a head start against others in the market to be the thought leader in the decentralized sports operations space. To make sure this continues, Krause House will need to invest in the work to build out the ideas, testing infrastructure, and ongoing projects around what it would actually mean to run a decentralized sports team. This work is already underway.\n\n**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\n- The DSO team has already learned a lot.\n- The DSO team will operate best when it is like an internal incubation function.\n- The DSO team will have five core responsibilities:\n    1. Build out the “Economic Membership” framework, beginning to measure revenue / fan engagement.\n    2. Fund explorations into new areas of a team to determine how it would be decentralized.\n    3. Help spin out successful explorations into their own proposals / teams.\n    4. “Build in public” to continue to re-enforce Krause House as a thought leader in this space.\n    5. Develop the industry term for decentralized sports operations (similar to how DeFi is used).\n\n**WHAT THE TEAM HAS ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED (in the last two months):** \n\n- Created structure of DSO team. Built pipeline of great talent within Krause House.\n- Built out thesis for decentralized scouting. Determined it wasn’t a low-risk, high-reward areas and paused further development. Documenting along the way in Command Center: [https://krausehousework.notion.site/Decentralized-Sports-Operations-DSO-cedb648113da4e1696f8ca0f900cbc48](https://www.notion.so/Decentralized-Sports-Operations-DSO-cedb648113da4e1696f8ca0f900cbc48).\n- Built out thesis for direct economic membership with fans. Validated with multiple internal and external stakeholders. Continuing this work. [https://docs.google.com/document/d/130AQtjef9L7Q_B_FpTSm3TPcmNviOy9lxuK-0r6wuwM/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/130AQtjef9L7Q_B_FpTSm3TPcmNviOy9lxuK-0r6wuwM/edit)\n- Built out thesis for virtual game experiences (VGE). [https://docs.google.com/document/d/130AQtjef9L7Q_B_FpTSm3TPcmNviOy9lxuK-0r6wuwM/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/130AQtjef9L7Q_B_FpTSm3TPcmNviOy9lxuK-0r6wuwM/edit)\n- Validated NBA teams are keen on exploring the concept of revenue / fan and how they can increase this for their team.\n\n**FUNDING DETAILS:**\n\n- We are requesting up to 3,000 $Krause / month\n- This will fund the DSO work for contributors **not including** the contributor streams for Brandan, Samir, and Tag. This funding is for contributors who join DSO and complete thought starters, briefs, and other bounties.\n- Funding model = 150 $Krause for initial though starter work. 450 $Krause for initial brief.\n\n****\n\n**TEAM:**\n\nBrandan, Sundin, and Tag have been working on DSO for many weeks. They have all been part of the initial work to get DSO off the ground. \n\n**OTHER RESEARCH OR NOTES:**\n\n*WAG🦇*",

      "content": "---\n\n**TITLE:** Requesting 5000 Polygon USDC to fund formal Dev Team Operations\n\n**FUNDING:** 5000 Polygon USDC\n\n**WALLET:** matic:0x21271619AD6466544c2f7D2B383014DcB48E6eB0\n\n- This is a Gnosis Safe controlled by:\n    - greg (0x34ef30c856CbaeDD604034b7202D9D7de23277dc)\n    - spicemaster (matic:0x28d17dA9De37c8eB0F5C7e20fCFBEecB6FcE3f42)\n    - *TO BE ADDED*: flex chapman\n\n---\n\n**SUMMARY:** \n\nThe dev team is requesting a seed budget in order to handle payments for their team \ninternally and operate more autonomously while maintaining alignment with the broader DAO towards purchasing an NBA team.  With the KH Dev Sub-DAO, we hope to cultivate a culture of building within Krause House, increase developer bandwidth, and implement best-in-class web3 development processes and practices. This is a one-off seed funding and will require an additional proposal for any more funds.\n\nThese funds will be used for new developer bounties, development expenses (gas costs, SaaS tools, etc), and other experimental projects the team decides to take on. This funding *does not* go towards any currently compensated developers (i.e. Eli and greg).\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS:**\n\nKrause House rests on the idea that web3 enables a better operating model for sports franchises. To demonstrate and leverage this improved approach, we must build the infrastructure and applications that make such an operating model a reality.\n\n**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\n1. To start, the Gnosis Safe signers will collectively determine how the team will use funds and operate.\n2. The devs currently on DAO streams will continue to receive their streams from the Krause House treasury. They will receive none of this funding.\n\n**Dev Team Governance:**\n\n- The funding will be sent to the KH Dev Team gnosis safe for management under gnosis signers.\n- These signers (mentioned above) will shape the early agenda for this dev team, and can progressively decentralize as they see appropriate.\n\n**TEAM:**\n\nThe current dev team is not new and has been operating within Krause House for 2 months+. We have delivered on multiple projects (KrauseBot in #nba-picks channel, [KH Roster](https://roster.krausehouse.club/), [KH Analytics](https://analytics.krausehouse.club/) Site) and have more in progress. This is with few formal working processes and severely limiting levels of bandwidth. We hope to drastically increase our output capability in the coming months.",

      "content": "Head to [#📜discuss-proposals](https://discord.gg/Mf8FHpHF) to comment.\n\n---\n\n**Recipient:** Bayesian Baller (author)\n\n**Wallet:** `0xD9b3Ad0eb0d3b9DF83CE919198F9ad0Ff692522F`\n\nUp to:\n\n- `1k $KRAUSE / month`\n- `1k USDC / month`\n\nPaid bi-monthly for 3 months.\n\nStewardship team may cancel this agreement at any point.\n\nCommunity may submit a proposal to cancel this agreement at any point.\n\n---\n\n### Scope of Work\n\n*A stream request is designed to give contributors freedom and encouragement to work across multiple domains across the DAO; however, here are the current main focuses / intentions:*\n\n- **Around The Association:** Research, record, produce, and market roughly 4 podcast episodes per month that drive community engagement, demonstrate the community’s basketball acumen, break down the barrier to entry to get non-crypto fans interested in Web3 / DAOs, and generate ad revenue for the Krause House treasury. Bayesian Baller has already released [5 episodes](https://open.spotify.com/show/3YadlLpwrMTOG0ecvX65bw) that have collectively surpassed 360+ streams.\n- **NBA Team Collaboration:** Bayesian Baller has already begun tapping into his network and facilitating opportunities between Krause House and stakeholders with several NBA teams. Specifically, Bayesian and Flex have been working together for the past month on developing strategies for KH to contribute to the Sacramento Kings (and/or Memphis Grizzlies) in a variety of analytics / data-driven content capacities.\n- **Big Ten Collaboration:** Bayesian Baller’s company ([Arria Boost](https://www.arria.com/sports/)) has a strong, working relationship with the NCAA’s Big Ten Conference. They will be working with the Big 10 throughout the B1G / NCAA Tournaments (and beyond) to produce data-driven content and long-form analytics pieces for key B1G stakeholders. Bayesian has gotten the KH Analytics Team involved and there is massive opportunity for a KH partnership here.\n- **OpenRuns / Pick-Up App:** Bayesian Baller had previously built and launched a pickup basketball mobile-app called [OpenRuns](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/openruns/id1038801937) that several Krause House members are eager to pursue further. They’ve formed a #pick-up-app channel in Discord, began recruiting power users, and plan to collaborate with other teams in KH (including the NOLA court creation team + the local city channels) to use the app for KH community building efforts.\n- **Analytics / Media Teams:** Bayesian Baller is a content creator and contributor to both the Krause House Analytics and Media Teams. In addition to his weekly podcast, he also creates audiograms, social media posts, and markets KH to the world across a variety of media channels. Here are a few examples of past posts from Bayesian Baller that have received 18,000+ views and impressions for KH on social media: [1](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1496651590605754368?s=20&t=SJulbTliE85EI8ouIyjkWQ), [2](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1494481064303104000?s=20&t=SJulbTliE85EI8ouIyjkWQ), [3](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1491592759420936196?s=20&t=SJulbTliE85EI8ouIyjkWQ), [4](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1487134724405743621?s=20&t=SJulbTliE85EI8ouIyjkWQ), [5](https://twitter.com/christianhanish/status/1468496834251264001?s=20&t=SJulbTliE85EI8ouIyjkWQ), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/sportsanalytics/comments/sy6fy9/how_to_land_a_job_in_the_nba_behind_the_scenes/), [7](https://www.reddit.com/r/heat/comments/sy750o/podcast_interview_with_former_heat_data_analyst/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n### Weekly Breakdown\n\n*A detailed breakdown of how Bayesian Baller’s time commitment to KH will be broken down across the aforementioned projects listed in the scope of work:*\n\n- Bayesian Baller will contribute roughly 15-20 hours per week.\n- The time commitment breaks down to roughly 10 hours per week towards podcasting (research, recording, post-production) and content creation (audiograms, social media). Here’s a snapshot of the current weekly time commitment:\n    - 3 hours: In-depth research, question / topic preparation, & script writing.\n    - 2 hours: Recording the podcast & giving guests a detailed rundown about KH.\n    - 2.5 hours: Post-production, editing, audio engineering, & prep for final release.\n    - 2.5 hours: Marketing, creating audiograms, & composing variety of social posts.\n- The additional 5-10 hours will be spent on managing and facilitating the potential NBA team collaboration, the Big Ten x KH partnership, and the OpenRuns x KH partnership. In addition to contributing to KH’s weekly Analytics and Media Team syncs.\n\n### Bayesian Baller Background:\n\n5+ years working professionally in basketball analytics, including the last 2.5 years as a Data Scientist / Product Manager for a leader in the basketball analytics space and the previous 2.5 years at the collegiate level with two major Div. 1 programs. Along the way, developed working relationships with a variety of influential figures in the basketball industry who will help facilitate partnerships and opportunities for Krause House to reach their ultimate goal of NBA ownership.\n\n### Specification\n\nThis contributor may submit a request for *up to* the specified amount based on self-assessment of their work.\n\n### Intention\n\nThis is intended to encourage contributors to take immediate action on a wide range of problems/opportunities, as opposed to proceeding through the slower process of submitting a proposal for a narrow scope of work.\n\nWe prefer to invest in and groom talent, giving *them* the freedom and capital they need to be entrepreneurs within our community.  We value self-starters who are able to take action and deliver quality work.\n\n### bUt SomEb0dY m1gHt t@kE t0o mUçh\n\nBoth the community and the Stewardship team has the power to cancel this stream if it is being abused.  In addition, if a contributor abuses this trust, they are effectively burning their social credibility and ability to successfully submit proposals in the future.  We expect some lossiness; however, we believe the benefits of getting good work off the ground is worth this small cost.\n\n### WAGBAT 🏀🦇",

      "title": "KH Accelerator Proposal",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposes that Krause House launches an accelerator for projects working in the future of sports. The accelerator would be a 6-week program with 2 official + 1 informal 90 min sessions per week. Each project approved would pledge 3% of their tokens via a tokenswap with KH (in exchange for 10,000 $KRAUSE).\n\n## What is the KH Accelerator?\n\nInspired by our experience at Seed Club, we propose that we build a process to help accelerate high quality projects sitting at the intersection of crypto <> sports. The accelerator would be a 6 week process with 2 official 90 min sessions per week. We’d cover a variety of topics including:\n\n* Positioning\n* Community Building\n* Onboarding\n* Governance\n* Tokenomics\n* Legal Learnings (not legal advice)\n* Tooling\n\nSome of these sessions would be led by Jerrys, others would be led by thought leaders in our network.\n\n## Why should we do this?\nWe’ve been approached by several incredible projects for assistance with many of the growing pains that we’ve experienced ourselves. KH is uniquely positioned to assist these other projects with insights, processes, & tools to scale their vision. \n\nOur strategy should be collaborative working with high quality projects sitting at the same intersection as KH. Additionally, this will serve as a treasury diversification opportunity to add new tokens to our treasury.\n\n## What do we need?\n\nPredominately $KRAUSE as well as time from a handful of Jerrys within the community.\n\n* $KRAUSE to use for a tokenswap with the projects that we engage with. \n* $KRAUSE to incentivize guest speakers. \n* $KRAUSE to compensate for our operational roles to help facilitate the accelerator (scheduling, hosting, communications, etc). \n\nTime from our talented Jerrys. The time commitment isn’t massive, but we need to value this project to support it from a variety of stakeholders to maximize success for the participants. \n\n## How much $KRAUSE?\n\n* 100,000 $KRAUSE for the tokenswaps\n* 25,000 $KRAUSE for guest speakers\n* 25,000 $KRAUSE for operations\n\nFor a grand total of 150,000 $KRAUSE. Any unspent $KRAUSE will be returned to the treasury. \n\nAdditionally, we'd like to be able to use any surpluses from one budget group to compensate for other budget groups. Meaning if we have a surplus of tokens avaialble from the tokenswaps, we could deploy those for guest speakers. \n\nAnyone on a full-time contributor compensation stream would not be eligible for $KRAUSE from this proposal. \n\n## Granting Funds\nIn lieu of a single wallet to hold these funds, this proposal is requesting the permission to allocate these funds on a as-needed-basis via Utopia (or similar).\n\n## When would we start?\nFeb 28nd, 2022. \n\n## Duration\nThis proposal is for 1 cohort batch lasting approximately 6 weeks from start date.\n\n## Reversibility\nIn the event we needed to reverse this decision, we'd be able to stop the sessions at once and remove the obligiation for the projects to provide tokens to KH. This proposal is quite reversible. \n\n---\n\nProposal Submitter: Commodore\nAccountable: Commodore & Flex Chapman",

We are going to reskin this for Krause House to help our contributors navigate these concerns.  Zakk did not ask anything for this guide; however, we feel it appropriate to gift him some $KRAUSE for the value he’s provided to the community.\n\n### Why gift someone for work that’s already done?\n\nWe hope to help foster a positive-sum ecosystem where DAOs can publish public goods (in this case information) and be rewarded for doing so, without needing to worry about value capture.  This starts by flowing value back to creators (extrinsic motivation) and thanking and highlighting them (intrinsic motivation).\n\n### Thanks\n\nThank you to Zakk, and to everyone in this ecosystem building public goods so that we can all thrive.",

      "title": "Discretionary Budget for Leadership Dojo",
      "content": "**Authors**: eli_ (Steward), John Silkey (Early KH Contributor, full-time Seed Club DAO)\n\n### Budget / Duration\n\n- Up to 1500 USDC + 1500 $KRAUSE / month for 4 months to bring in outside experts as needed.\n- Up to $1200 USDC or 600 KRAUSE per month to John for hosting and facilitating some sessions.\n- We do not anticipate using the full amount, but are high-balling to avoid the need for a future proposal.\n- Requests will be submitted to Utopia by eli_ on behalf of the facilitators.\n\nThese funds are requested as a budget to bring in experts/practitioners, not to pay contributors for this work.  We will request funds when relevant, and any leftover funds will remain in the treasury.\n\n### What is a Leadership Practice Circle?\n\nA regular, *opt-in*, space where we will host facilitated sessions in emotional intelligence, empathic communication, and conflict resolution.  We plan to bring a range of facilitators initially to find a fit.  John is trained in facilitation and human development, and has experience as an executive coach, and will likely lead sessions as well given his ties to the community.  The sessions, themes, and directions will be iterative based on the demands of the participants and based on guidance from this team.\n\n### Why?\n\nHow we connect and relate determines how well we work together. Connecting and relating is hard even when we're at our best. It can be destructive when we're stressed or running on empty.\n\nAs we’ve experienced in Krause House, and in DAO’s more broadly, change is constant, leaving us feeling in a constant state of transition. And it turns out, humans aren’t naturally great at navigating transition and change - we get tense, stressed, and make emotionally driven decisions. Like the best NBA players, we need practice to stay in the moment, even when it gets heated. \n\nHaving a place to practice self-awareness and staying open under stress offers compound returns whether we take action or not.  We believe upskilling leaders within Krause House is an investment in:\n\n- Setting a healthy and constructive norm for how we relate and communicate that others can model.\n- Greater ability to hold healthy dispute and conflict as a means to collective intelligence.\n- Greater ability to address and constructively build from the frustration of community members.\n- Greater encouragement for new leaders to speak up and take leadership roles.\n- Greater sense of welcoming and acknowledgment for newcomers.\n- General vibe and tone of the community.\n\nEarly DAO contributors inevitably move into leadership roles as newcomers look to them for guidance and experience.  The weight and impact that our words and actions have on others increases with time, and we hope to give the leaders within Krause House the space and resources they need to grow.",

Podcasting is an effective and concise way to inform/update the Krause community. Although, editing a podcast can be a tedious and time-consuming task; Outsourcing the editing to a professional ensures a fast and consistent turn-around for each episode and a high-quality product.\n\n### **HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\nOnce I receive the recorded audio, I can then clean, edit, mix and add sound design to each episode in a timely manner.\n\n### **DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:**\n\nEnsure that each episode is released at a high level of quality by the required deadline.\n\n### **FUNDING DETAILS:**\n\nI estimate each episode will approximately take 4-7 hours to edit.\n\nEditing time can be subject to variables such as: \n\n- Length of recording\n- Quality of the audio\n- Cohesion and flow of recorded conversation\n- Addition of sound design\n\nThe payment amount will vary based on the number of audio recordings I will be receiving from the Podcast Hosts. \n\nI have already edited 4 episodes/segments for Jerry’s Digest Podcast, which totaled an amount of 16 hours of editing work, equating to `$1,120 USDC`. \n\nFor future edits, I will track hours and provide a breakdown of the hours worked to then invoice to the DAO - **Capping the maximum amount of `30 hours` per month.**\n\n### **TEAM:**\n\nI am a professional audio engineer. I have years of experience working in music, film, TV, radio, and podcasting in a professional recording studio. \n\n### **OTHER RESEARCH OR NOTES:**\n\nI have been the driving force for the Redacted Cartel podcast (Redacted Radio). To date, I have planned, produced, recorded, edited, and mixed 6 episodes.  [https://anchor.fm/redacted-radio](https://anchor.fm/redacted-radio)",

      "content": "\n\n---\n\nHop into [#📜discuss-proposals](https://discord.com/channels/847908414981275648/910643982822965248) in Discord to drop feedback.\n\nAuthor: Nibblez\n\n---\n\n### **Funding Details**\n- Duration: 2 months\n- Nibblez can request up to 800USDC/ month based on self-assessment of work.\n- Stewardship Team may veto this stream at any point.\n- Roughly 10 hours / week\n\n\n### **Meme Samples**\n\n[1](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1489373138739625986), [2](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1487440395294453763), [3](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1486111645340291072), [4](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1483630952274599936), [5](https://twitter.com/KrauseHouseDAO/status/1482283501055791107)\n\n### **Goal of project:**\n\nThe goal is to provide engaging memes through the media platforms (Twitter, Discord, Instagram etc.) that Krause House communicates through. Ultimately, by providing in-house memes specific to Krause House, Twitter will bring more members to the DAO under the culture and guise that we are Krause House and we are here to purchase a team.\n\nIn addition to generating memes for content on the various platforms, I also welcome any project leads to DM me on Discord for content creation. For example, a lead wishes to promote their project but needs content specific to the work completed to boost community engagement. In essence, I will be available for support through meme generating for any and all projects in progress on the command centre.\n\n### **Why this matters:**\n\nThis proposal is built on the increased engagement on all meme posts on the Krause House Twitter. Memes are an integral part of community engagement across all platforms, particularly in the Web3 space. By kick starting this project, I am effectively bringing more attention and thus more members to Krause House and demonstrating to our wider audience that we have a strong meme culture in our DAO.",

      "content": "---\n\nHead to #📜discuss-proposals in Discord for discussion.\n\nAuthor: eli_\n\n---\n\n### Why?\n\nTo avoid contributors being held up with questions about whether they can request refunds on tooling such as software subscriptions, we propose that the existing Stewards Team (listed below) is able to process refunds for contributors without needing to poll Snapshot.\n\n### On Do-ocracy\n\nMy hope is that this allows Krause House to become increasingly do-ocratic, meaning that we are able to quickly allow new leaders with fresh ideas to get the permissions and funds they need, with as little friction as possible.  To use a biological metaphor, if we’re a swarm of birds, we don’t want to consult the swarm as a whole about every little turn.\n\n### How this will work.\n\nJerry's would message a Steward about a proposed expense.  If the Steward deems this a legitimate expense, the expense can be paid without moving to Snapshot.  By legitimate, we mean that the expense is conducted in the best interests of Krause House and is requested by someone who has some trust within the community.  For smaller asks, less scrutiny will be taken to minimize friction.\n\n### Example Scenarios:\n\n- Mario wants to spin up a Gitbook and messages Commodore for the OK, funds move over to him in 1-3 days instead of needing to move through Snapshot.\n- Eli spends gas setting up an ENS name for a Krause House production and messages Flex to get the OK, is quickly paid back.\n\n### Reversibility\n\nBy “delegated”, we mean that these powers can be stripped or given to others.  If you would like to add someone to this team or remove them, you can do so by proposal.\n\n### Note\n\nThe **total** expense must be below $1000.  Stewards are ***not*** entitled to split an expense into parts to justify it.\n\n### Current Stewards Roster:\n\n- commodore\n- flexchapman\n- mario lopes\n- eli_\n- magnus\n- gladrobot\n- lewwwk\n- dogstoevsky",

      "title": "Artist/Influencer Ambassador Program",
      "content": "Head to #📜discuss-proposals in Discord to discuss.\n\n---\n\n\n**Requesting 2,000 USDC + 400 $KRAUSE per month, with milestone based comp up to 6000 $KRAUSE (capped at 2 months) for the Artist/Influencer Ambassador Program**\n\nAuthor: mike kadziulis\n\n\n---\n\n**Milestone Based Funding:** \n\nMike + Project Team: To further incentivize the project team to exceed base goals, we are proposing the following milestone-based compensation (capped at 6,000 $KRAUSE / month):\n\n- 500 $KRAUSE for securing an artist ambassador of at least 500k combined followers on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.\n- 1,000 $KRAUSE for securing an artist ambassador of at least 1 million combined followers on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.\n- 2,000 $KRAUSE for securing an artist ambassador of at least 5 million combined followers on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.\n\n**WALLET:** 0x6b0c86b47a8520Bd50EE4B6466b85c4DFBCc02C1\n\n**PROJECT LEADS:** mike kadziulis#7443\n\n---\n\n**TEAM:**\n\nThis will be lead by myself (Mike Kadziulis) who has 10+ years of music industry experience and currently manages artists including Aluna/AlunaGeorge who is an artist that is currently leading experimentation in the music NFT space. Artists I’ve worked closely with over the years include: Chance the Rapper, Aluna/AlunaGeorge, Kacy Hill, Jessie Reyez, Daniel Caesar, and more.\n\n**SUMMARY:** \n\nThe goal of this project is to engage artists and influencers to find strategic partners to join Krause House and become “ambassadors” in exchange for DAO governance tokens $KRAUSE.\n\n**GOAL OF PROJECT:**\n\nThe ideal Krause House ambassador is an artist or influencer who is a sports fan (especially if they’re an NBA fan) and/or engage in Web3 projects. Ideas for targets at the top level include Lil Wayne (who’s a New Orleans native and a Pelicans fan) and Drake ([who has publicly pushed for a WNBA team in Toronto](https://www.si.com/wnba/2021/11/03/drake-wnba-expansion-team-toronto)). We will also engage artists that have engaged in Web3 projects such as Diplo, DeadMau5, and more.\n\nThese aforementioned artists are the “north star” artists we will engage, but we also will look to find ways for artists and influencers of various sizes to be a part of Krause House and publicly support it through strategic social media and press campaigns.\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS:**\n\nThe NBA has adopted the idea of teams having official/unofficial ambassadors from the music community as musicians bring strong cultural value to teams. Jay-Z & the Nets, Drake & the Raptors, Snoop Dogg & the Lakers, and 2 Chainz & the Hawks are all examples of artists who bring cultural value to NBA teams, and have strong ties to the local communities of the respective team’s market.\n\nWhat’s special about the DAO structure is that artists can now not only become ambassadors for a team, but also have ownership.\n\nThe exploratory aspect of this plan is to find out through conversations with various artists and managers what kind of compensation package artists at each level would look for to become an ambassador for Krause House. Through this exploratory phase, we will develop a tiered structure of compensation packages that will be used for future ambassadors.\n\nWe will also explore what kind of budget it will take to produce an event/concert where artists (preferably ambassadors) perform to raise awareness for Krause House. We can also include panels, activations, etc.\n\n**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\nOver the course of two months, I will:\n\n1. Engage artist managers within my network to set up discussions about having the artists they work with being a part of Krause House and potentially an ambassador.\n2. Define what an ambassador’s responsibilities would entail. This would include a combination of social posts, Twitter Spaces, Discord AMA, KH podcast appearance and a press release around the announcement of them joining as an ambassador. We want the ambassador to engage organically with whatever platforms they currently engage on, so it doesn’t feel too “shilly” and feels authentic to their audience. The initial onboarding of an ambassador would include an agreed upon amount of social posting and engagements, and then as Krause House continues to develop and evolve, we would engage the ambassador to support where it feels authentic to them.\n3. Engage the Krause House community to get suggestions on who the ideal “Krause House” ambassadors could be.\n4. Work with the Full-time Contributors and NOLA Pelicans Bid team to identify New Orleans based artists that can help bring value to the community building aspect of the project and eventual Pelicans bid.\n5. Work with the Partnerships Team and Full-time Contributors to establish a compensation package for various levels of artists/influencers that join Krause House and publicly support KH through social media posts and engagement.\n6. Submit new Snapshot proposals for ambassador compensation packages. Example: Lil Wayne coming on board as a Krause House artist ambassador in exchange for 10,000 $KRAUSE. \n7. Hopefully, begin to confirm Krause House’s first artist ambassadors.\n8. Explore producing an event/concert where artists (preferably ambassadors) perform to raise awareness for Krause House.\n\nAfter the 2 month period is over, I will look to refine the ambassador program strategy based on the findings from the initial period, and then propose a plan that will continue the work of onboarding strategic Krause House ambassadors based on the current roadmap and priorities.",

We have a wide audience to naturally pull from, and inherent interest from both sides of the platform. The decentralized nature of KH as a DAO naturally fits into the decentralized nature of the media platform.\n\nI see this as a core development of KH’s brand, and along with its reputation within NBA circle, in particular analytical minds (such as Lowe, Simmons, etc.). This is a great way to show legitimacy, engage a large user base, and potentially insert ourselves into NBA circles.\n\n**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\nWe’ve split the long term vision into 4 phases. For future phases please TAL at the [1-Pager](https://www.notion.so/KH-Analytics-Content-Platform-1-Pager-1009feec3e274323a45de894b2feb47d).\n\nPhase 1 consists of:\n\n- Create a public facing website to publish articles.\n- Build a brand around said website, even if it’s only within KH.\n- Create an interface via KH to allow users to register for article generation in exchange for some form of compensation (can be manual, or tipping?)\n- Pick 1-2  article types that we believe has the highest cost to reward ratio.\n    - My thought atm is: Fantasy analysis and trade/fa/team analysis.\n- Onboard a couple of writers to help contribute.\n- 2-3 paragraphs in the newsletter.\n\n**DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:**\n\nPhase 1 success criteria includes:\n\n- Launch the website.\n- Recruit a core team of at least 4 writers.\n- Generate at least 5 articles per week (TBD on number).\n- Increase our visibility in KH public channels - create a highly visible space in our discord to post new articles.\n- Aim to average 50 views per article.\n- Figured out a compensation model for phase 2 that is better tied to quality of engagement.\n\n**FUNDING DETAILS:**\n\nUp to 500 $USDC will be allocated to article writers, depending on the quality of the article - decided by @Greg and @pod fog until specified otherwise. This is to encourage writers to write quality articles.\n\n- For longer form content, 50 $USDC will be allocated per article written (I timed myself writing one, it took about 90 minutes to do so).\n- For short form articles, 25 $USDC will be allocated per article.\n\n$KRAUSE allocation will occur at the end of the 4 week period.\n\n$KRAUSE allocation is contingent on articles passing a minimum bar of quality (no low effort content).\n\nAny remaining $USDC will be held in the Analytics House treasury. Additional $USDC distributed based on contributor’s success in execution of the vision as part of the phase 2 proposal, after phase 1 has terminated. Some $USDC may be withheld to help execute future projects.\n\nCompensation structure will need iteration for future phases.\n\n**TEAM:**\n\nI come from a product engineering background, so I have firsthand experience in building a product and focusing on the user. This user oriented approach to analytics will help our content be accessible.\n\nTo be honest I don’t have industry experience writing analytical content, but I’m very well versed in cap rules and play a wide variety of fantasy related games. One of them is a multiplayer league in Basketball GM, which is effectively a GM simulation game for evaluating players and team situation, so I feel I have a decent grasp of value and team situations around the league.\n\nOur writing team will come from a wide background, and that’s what will make it great! Because NBA fans also come from a wide variety of backgrounds, and look for different things when doing so.\n\n**OTHER RESEARCH OR NOTES:**\n\nThis is one of the core pillars of the higher level KH Analytical House vision, which can be found here: [https://www.notion.so/krausehousework/KH-Analytics-House-Vision-1-Pager-9ef78441f23446fab0d4cfd7ba9cc935](https://www.notion.so/KH-Analytics-House-Vision-1-Pager-9ef78441f23446fab0d4cfd7ba9cc935)\n\nSeparate proposals will be created for the other two pillars once they have been sufficiently scoped out and thought through, potentially further down the line.",

      "content": "# Proposal\n\n### Create a “Vibe Check” Team comprised of the following individuals to manage Guest Passes to the Krause House Discord.\n\n- Flex Chapman\n- Commodore\n- Mario Lopes\n- Magnus\n\n# Why?\n\nIf NBA Commissioner Adam Silver showed up in the `#public-chat` channel of Discord saying he wanted to join Krause House, it is ***clearly*** in the best interest of Krause House to grant him whatever access he wants without a second thought.  Similarly, if a highly skilled programmer shows up with a prototyped tool custom built for Krause House, it’s in the best interest of Krause House to grant them access to that they can start collaborating with existing contributors.\n\nTherefore, this proposal would establish a team that is responsible for granting a limited number of Guest Passes for access to Discord.  Note, these Passes do **not** grant any $KRAUSE or NFT Ticket to the recipient, and can be revoked at any time.\n\n# Checks and Balances\n\n**Note**, if the community is not happy with this Vibe Check team, they are entitled to (1) change its roster or (2) revoke their permissions entirely.  For instance, someone could propose to nominate someone new to that roster, or remove someone who they believe is not acting in the best interests of Krause House from the roster.\n\nIf a community member has an issue with someone with a Guest Pass and would like that pass removed, they should feel welcomed to bring this issue to the Vibe Check team.\n\n# Why this team, and why is it called “Vibe Check”?\n\nThis team is comprised of the 2 creators of Krause House (Flex and Commodore), and two early contributors.  This team is in constant partnership talks, meaning they are the first contacts to people who would need expedient access to the Discord.",

      "content": "Context: [Please refer to Original Full-Time Team Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x99aa0687b4e443a59b71f32f45df2ec4f899afdc1bccb88612fa5de4ddd6440d)\n\nKey Terms:\n- *Dynamic Compensation*: Lower Base Pay + Unlimited Upside Potential\n- *Static Compensation*: Base Pay + No additional comp above this\n\n### Why?\n\nDynamic compensation was intended to incentivize full-time contributors to earn above their base wage; however, this now feels (1) like a distraction from work and (2) bad incentive alignment. \n\nI’d prefer to be in a compensation model where I can just focus on results without having to worry about asking the DAO for additional comp.\n\n### Reminder: Basic Full-time Conditions\n\n- Community can vote out a full time contributor at any point.\n- Ends in 4 months and must reapply.\n- Must hold 100% of existing $KRAUSE balance to receive pay.\n\n### Change\n\nOriginal: 10k $KRAUSE with unlimited upside through additional proposals.\n\nFixed: 10k $KRAUSE + 6667 USDC fixed.\n\n\n### Transparency\n\nFor transparency’s sake, here’s what I’ve been up to since the initial proposal passed.  This is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather a few highlights:\n\n1. Building Krause House wallet / dashboard with the initial features of a (1) token weighted forum to discuss Snapshot votes and (2) a place to create petitions for specific people or teams to sign off on.  I see this more generally as turning into a home where Jerry’s can (1) perform a number of voting functions, (2) interact with KH smart contracts for commitment staking or token lockups for multipliers, (3) so many possibilities, the design space here is *huge*.\n2. Created Open Bounty Board + Discord Bot to help contributors and newcomers understand where they can provide value.\n3. Built Snapshot Discord Bot to keep voters up to date from within the Discord.\n4. Built Proposals Database Bot to pipe open proposals data into Discord (took offline, not sure if it’s useful).\n5. Proposal reviews, working with contributors to edit/improve proposals, managing Snapshot, and working to improve ease of proposals.  This includes experimenting with improved UX, including creating forms to help simplify the process and TL;DR versions of how governance works—more to come.\n6. Working 1-on-1 with contributors to help them take leadership and initiate teams.\n7. Generally, and most importantly, whatever is needed / general gardening of the DAO.  Recruiting new talent, managing Discord, troubleshooting, fixing issues as they arise.\n\n### WAGBAT",

Canada, Australia, UK.\n    1. This will be done through interviews with league offices and franchise operators around the world. Please share contacts with these individuals if you have contacts you believe we should be including our interviews.\n- Analyze professional basketball franchises (via a series of interviews) in 8 cities that may be ideal targets for KH. Providing the KH group with a summary of the economic, technological and “fan/community” related opportunities and challenges associated with franchise ownership in these markets.\n- Propose next steps. Including entry points for entering into franchise ownership discussions. Recommend executive roles & skillsets that will be needed to negotiate the purchase of an international team.\n    - Once established this global following will have a vested interested in seeing Krause House succeed on the ultimate goal of “Buying an NBA team”. This global following will be an important asset as we engage with the NBA league office, existing governors, and the ecosystem of operators around the NBA.\n\n**DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:**\n\n*List of measurable KPIs that will determine projects success in the next 30 days*\n\n1. Identify a list of 3 potential franchises for Krause House purchase consideration\n2. Provide an overview of the operational opportunities and challenges for Krause House associated with international professional basketball team ownership\n3. Recommend a strategy, roles, responsibilities and skill sets necessary to succeed in the acquisition and operation of a franchise.\n\n**FUNDING DETAILS:**\n\nRequesting 500 $KRAUSE as a base compensation to complete the work described in the “Definition of Success?” section above.\n\nIn addition we are requesting the following milestone-based compensation for providing the following:\n\n1500 $KRAUSE for completed interview video/written transcript with top official (owner/GM) for an international franchise. Maximum 3000 $KRAUSE as evaluated by the Stewards Team.\n\nWe intend to conduct as many interviews as possible. Video/written transcripts will be produced to provide context of conversations, including descriptions of challenges and opportunities related to operating a professional franchise in selected markets.\n\n**TEAM:**\n\n*`Why will you succeed? What is your expertise, experience, or ethos?`*\n\nOur committee will deliver a comprehensive report to the Krause House members that will: \n\na) Provide clarity around the state of international basketball franchise ownership as it relates to Krause House’s mandate to test the Decentralized Sports Organization thesis before embarking on the NBA team ownership path \n\nb) Report on the pros and cons of Krause House ownership of specific franchises based on interviews conducted with senior level team and basketball officials across several leagues, and \n\nc) Provide a recommended path forward if the KH member community decides to pursue our recommendations. \n\n**Committee Leadership / Team Members:** \n\nThe committee is lead by a former senior level executive, chief digital officer, at Canada’s longest operating professional basketball league, NBL Canada. In addition to his role at the NBL Canada our lead is employed by a leading Web2 digital solutions company where he works closely with c-suite executives at the NBA league office and its community of franchises, helping to drive strategies for fan engagement programs, which are now seeing the opportunity and potential disruption related to Web3, NFT’s and play to earn gaming. \n\n2 of our committee members have played professional basketball internationally at the highest levels - at some of the top leagues in the world - where we intend to explore franchise opportunities and schedule leader interviews. Including: *Canada, Australia, Italy, France*, and the *NBA summer league*. \n\nBoth of these committee members have relationships in place with team and league executives around the world that will help to speed the time it takes to schedule and complete the interviews that will inform our report and recommendations. \n\nThe committee is made up of committed WAGBAT’s that believe the international franchise ownership path may be the perfect testing ground for Krause House’s Web3 centric form of fan ownership and fan engagement. We plan to provide a complete, informed perspective for our fellow token holders to assess and understand this opportunity before deciding on a path forward. **#WAGBAT**",

Centered around fully customizable digital spaces, Gather makes spending time with communities just as easy as real life by allowing users to navigate community maps with their digital avatars.\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS:**\n\nKrause House is a globally distributed DAO and thrives off of the collective enthusiasm and passion for basketball. Creating our own metaverse will enable the large community to feel smaller than it really is, a strength of any strong community. Furthermore, as we continue towards our path of buying an NBA team, growing a digitally-engaged community will be an advantage for our group.\n\n**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\n- We will be contracting an experienced Gather.Town mapmaker to customize a basketball themed space\n\nWe will be creating a [gather.town](http://gather.town) environment that will enable the following:\n\n- Members will be able to collectively participate in Onboarding Draft Classes\n- Watch live streamed games or highlight reels together\n- Place predictions on the games to win prizes and/or “status tokens”\n- Meet n greet with community members\n- Meet n greet with guest speakers\n- Purchase KH merch sales in a metaverse kiosk\n- Creating activities that both individuals and groups can engage in within the metaverse autonomously\n    - ex. a treasure hunt\n\nBonus:\n\n- Members will be able to self-onboard to KH DAO based on designed knowledge quests & tasks before joining a project\n\n**Quick Draft of Potential Rooms (create a floor plan / figma to share with pixel artist)** \n\n- Map will be a Krause House Stadium\n    - Court + Arena\n    - A potential layout below:\n    \n    ![Layout14.jpg](http://www.csusmcougars.com/images/2014/10/20/Layout14.jpg?0.8989248)\n    \n    [The Sports Center](https://csusmcougars.com/sports/2014/10/20/GEN_1020142100.aspx?id=315)\n    \n- At one end of the stadium there is 2 Boardrooms for conferences\n    - For Town Halls and Team Meetings\n- Additionally, there will be a Film Room for “viewing parties” to stream games\n- Merch kiosk room or NFT’s\n- Onboarding Room - a custom room where ppl can engage with items to learn more\n    - Members will be able to self-onboard to KH DAO based on designed knowledge quests & tasks before joining a project\n- Press Room - where AMAs will exist + Group onboarding\n- Multiple small rooms for people to play, meet n greet in\n\n**FUNDING DETAILS:**\n\nWe will be sending USDC to the [gather.town](http://gather.town) map maker to the nominated wallet of their choice. \n\n**PRICE BREAKDOWN & Figma File:**\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1srX8dJIO1-a4lGCnPlYu8Awbb0AqwCXOEdMghcDbNbc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1srX8dJIO1-a4lGCnPlYu8Awbb0AqwCXOEdMghcDbNbc/edit?usp=sharing)\n****\n\n**TEAM:**\n\nMario & Magnus have successfully created [gather.town](http://gather.town) events of up to 300+ people & have since received numerous requests from DAOs and protocols to design their metaverse experiences.\n\nDluxe is leading the media team and has proven the ability to drum up hype for events both internally and externally to the DAO.",

      "content": "TITLE: Requesting 5,250 $KRAUSE and $500 USDC to Establish Public Bounty System\n\nFUNDING: 5,000 $KRAUSE to fund Public Bounties; $500 USDC and 250 $KRAUSE to Dluxe for program set-up & maintenance\n\nWALLET: N/A\n\nPROJECT LEADS: DLuxe, Mario Lopes\n\nGOAL OF PROJECT:\n\nDevelop a clear process for non-ticketed individuals interested in gaining Krause House Access through Bounty contributions. Each bounty task will be assigned $KRAUSE as compensation (min 100 $KRAUSE). The Bounty list will be a made available in the Public section of the discord and will be communicated via Draft Class sessions and social media.\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS:\n\nAs we continue to generate awareness for KH, there will be more and more fans who want to engage but don’t know how. They arrive at the Discord but are gated from further engagement. Their access is limited to the Public areas and they are currently unable to participate in projects. Krause House is a decentralized organization with a supportive culture. We believe that every NBA fan has the opportunity to be a part of owning a team. As such, we want to make Krause House open, not only to those who are able to purchase tickets, but also to those who are willing to make meaningful contributions to improve the DAO. This proposal focuses on engaging those individuals who want to contribute via individual bounty tasks vs being part of an existing KH Team.\n\nHOW THIS WILL BE DONE:\n\nWe propose establishing and communicating a Bounty Program outside the gated area where potential contributors can come and sign up to perform key tasks that earn them $KRAUSE tokens. A Bounty Bot will automate the process and update daily. Team leads will be able to add bounties to the list. The Bounty Program will be shared as part of the Draft Class process, clearly outlined in the Public discord section and communicated through social media. Interested members will be able to sign up and complete bounties for $KRAUSE. \n\nDEFINITION OF SUCCESS:\n\nSuccess will be measured by 1) the number of bounty opportunities created by team/project leads and 2) the number of people who “apply” for these bounties. Our goal is to see a minimum of 50% of available bounty projects completed by non-ticketed individuals. We will track participation to determine success.\n\nFUNDING DETAILS:\n\nWe are requesting 5,000 $KRAUSE to fund approximately the first ~25 project bounties.\n\nWe are also requesting $500 USDC and 250 $KRAUSE for Dluxe to set up this program & maintain the bounty board (with assistance from Mario).\n\nBounties can fall into 3 categories, based on time commitment \n(Free Throw<5 hrs work 100 $KRAUSE; Jump Shot 5-20 hrs work 200 $KRAUSE; 3-Pointer > 20 hrs work 350 $KRAUSE).*** \n\nHere is an example bounty list for launch. Additional Bounties will be collected once proposal is approved. Contributors would reach out to the designated contact for each project.\n\nLIST OF EXAMPLE PROJECT BOUNTIES HERE 👉https://www.notion.so/krausehousework/Requesting-5-250-KRAUSE-and-500-USDC-to-Establish-Public-Bounty-System-18d3ccf3e3ac4c6c95bfce628562692e \n\nAdditional Bounties will be collected once proposal is approved.

      "title": "3500 $KRAUSE for Partnership Deliverables",
      "content": "**TITLE: Partnerships R&D Project**\n\n**FUNDING: 3,500 $KRAUSE**\n\n**WALLET: TBD**\n\n**PROJECT LEADS: ritzleroy**\n\n---\n\n**Goal**\n\nTo raise public awareness of KH, top of funnel membership growth, strong web3 relationships, further legitimize the KH brand through association with partners, solve infrastructure problems, and eventually contribute to on-chain funding.\n\n**Idea**\n\nThis proposal is a request for a lump sum amount of $KRAUSE to be paid to the Partnerships contributing team as compensation for R&D. The approach here is more exploratory as structure/processes still need to be fine-tuned. Future proposal(s) will be submitted once partnership agreements are made and there is a clear understanding of what the appropriate means of funding should be. This is meant to answer unknown questions, and additional proposals will be used to execute on those answers.\n\n**Unique Value Proposition for KH**\n\nIf successful, this ongoing project of securing partnerships will give KH added brand recognition, membership growth/engagement, and increased treasury funds. Additional ways to potentially overdeliver value back to the KH community may include:\n\n- Discover new DAO tooling (ie Wonderverse)\n- Develop strong web3 relationships\n- Exclusive perks for members\n- Enhance recruiting strategy\n\n**Accountability**\n\nI, @ritzleroy, would like to lead this team to build out this project, along with @liamherbst_. We currently have 8 other KH members interested in Partnerships to assist with research, inbound filtering, tooling, messaging, team structuring, deal flow, and inbound/outbound strategies.\n\nWe will hold weekly sync sessions to discuss the current pipeline, delegate categories to pursue and accounts for members to hold individual responsibility, collaborate with other KH team members for various partnership initiatives, and set goals with hard deadlines to ensure task completion.\n\n**Compensation**\n\nIf this proposal is accepted, we’ll need to do a few rounds of iteration. The focus will be primarily on the below, and from there we will be able to determine appropriate compensation structures and timelines.\n\nBy the end of **3** weeks, we will aim to have definitive answers on:\n\n1. CRM tooling\n2. Messaging\n3. Deal flow\n4. Partnership priorities\n5. High level team structure\n6. Inbound/outbound strategies\n\nI, @ritzleroy, propose a lump sum in the amount of 3,500 $KRAUSE to be paid to contributors once all of the below deliverables are met. This was determined by deciding on a reasonable hourly rate -\n\n*Assuming that about 20 hours/week collectively will be spent working on the project, team meetings, etc (2 hours/week/member if all were to contribute equally)*\n\n*3 week timeline*\n\n*~60 hours total*\n\n3,5*00 $KRAUSE / 60 hours = 58 $KRAUSE per hour*\n\nThis will be split amongst the group based on individual hours and contributions made. Payment of only $KRAUSE will incentivize members to continue contributing and promoting KH, as they have a direct share in the success of the DAO.\n\n**Objectives**\n\n***Completion*** of the below deliverables **3** weeks following the approval of this proposal:\n\n1. Prioritizing partnerships\n    1. Tiered list broken down into 5 categories\n2. Messaging template (consistent language for outreach)\n    1. 1-2 copy/paste email verbiage\n3. Team structure (leads + members/acct)\n    1. 3-5 determined team leads with a core team of contributors\n4. CRM tooling decision and set up\n    1. 1-2 platforms to utilize for future initiatives\n5. Actionable strategies for inbound filtering and cold outreach\n    1. Reference prioritized categories\n6. Deal flow structure\n    1. Determine standard process of deal from start to finish",

      "title": "Deploy up to 30 ETH in acquiring a RKL Club NFT in the upcoming Q1 2022 auction. ",
      "content": "---\n\nNote: This proposal is a modification of a [previous proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0xefc34ecb85d70ba96f56dbebd71e7787cf4e13fefd6ffc09fa3d9832e0054cc7) updated according to community feedback.\n\n---\n\n### Summary \nWe envision Krause House being a major owner (and the brand) behind a top-tier Rumble Kong Club. We envision this Club as a sub-DAO of Krause House, with its own token (liquid ownership). This will allow us to build a strong community and treasury for the Club to be used to aggressively attack Club operations and management. We envision the KH RKL Club signing top Kongs, partnership with big brand sponsorships, driving revenue, captivating a fanbase, and ultimately - winning championships. Owning and managing a digital franchise is an important iteration for Krause House while on it’s path to buying ownership stakes in IRL franchises.\n\nWhile this is a lofty vision, it starts with acquiring a RKL Club NFT, which is the focus of this proposal. It is intended for future proposals to focus on launching a work stream for all the effort that will be required to establish the Club. But for now, the best path forward (as we explore the sub-DAO design space for both regulatory and effectiveness purposes) is to propose that the KH Treasury funds the acquisition of a RKL Club in the first auction (Q1 2022).\n\nWe propose that the Krause House Treasury deploys up to 30 ETH in acquiring a RKL Club NFT in the upcoming Q1 2022 auction. In time, a subDAO structure may be proposed and it is likely that external capital will be raised - it is intended that KH could be paid back up to 100% of the cost of the acquisition of the RKL Club NFT.\n\n### Background\nRumble Kong League (RKL) is the metaverse’s basketball league. Rumble Kong’s are programmatically generated, unique (10,000) NFTs that represent playable avatars. Each Kong has built-in stats/skills as well as visual rarities. The RKL team just raised $4.5m to continue to create the premier play-to-earn sports game. Rumble Kong’s rank #15 in trade volume on OpenSea over the past 7 days. Steph Curry and Paul George are among the NBA players that have now purchased a Kong. \n\nRKL recently announced the launch of Clubs. Clubs will be at the center of gameplay and the play-to-earn economy within RKL. Individual Kongs will sign on-chain contracts with Clubs. Clubs will deploy teams to play in different divisions. Thus, the revenue flow within the game flows through Clubs. Clubs will be major brands, sign sponsorship deals, create merchandise, and build fanbases.\n\nJust as IRL franchises are in our sights, digital franchises should be as well.\n\n### Value Proposition\nBroadly, we have a lot to explore and learn as we pursue our goals of purchasing and managing stakes in sports franchises:\n- Regulatory structures\n- Fundraising\n- Value transfer to/from Krause House\n- Governance\n- Management\n- Community\n\nAn RKL Club will allow us to experiment with all. Specifically, we want to highlight how an RKL Club aligns with the vision, mission, and values of the Krause House DAO across sports operations, governance, brand & community, and treasury. \n\n##### Sports Operations\nAn RKL Club gives us a lower-risk environment (thinking on the scale of hundreds of thousands of dollars vs tens of millions of dollars) to explore, iterate, and learn how to operate a sports franchise. RKL Clubs will need all of the following functions:\n\n- Scouting\n- Analytics\n- General Management\n- Coaching\n- Brand / Design\n- Social\n- Merchandise\n- Partnerships \n- Sponsorships\n- Events\n\n\nThere is quite a bit about the game that is still to be determined (see the whitepaper). We know that Clubs will sign on-chain contracts with players. Clubs will be responsible for managing rosters and fielding teams in leagues. Clubs will sign partnerships and sponsorships within the metaverse. Clubs will build brands, community, and fanbases. Clubs will seek to win championships and hang banners and trophies.\n\nAll of the functions in the list above overlap directly with operations that will need to exist in the management of an IRL team (shoutout to the group working on the Decentralized Sports Operations (DSO) Stream proposal). Obviously there will be differences - this is not an IRL team. However, an RKL Club can be a go-to option for testing hypotheses and running experiments as we build out capabilities to manage an IRL team.\n\n##### Governance\nHow will governance flow into sports operations? Will there be a layer of base token voting? On what decisions? What will be delegated off of governance and onto specific roles (i.e. GM, or Coach)? There are a lot of open questions around the best structures to marry fractional ownership and governance of a sports franchise with the actual management of the sports franchise. \n\nGovernance is already difficult within Web3 and DAOs. By the time KH buys IRL stakes, we better have some strong governance and management primitives ready to employ - an IRL stake is not the best for experimentation given the high stakes associated. An RKL Club lets us start working in the governance design space immediately, maybe even running through multiple iterations.\n\n##### Brand & Community\nIt is an incredible opportunity to build our brand and expand our community. As of now, RKL is the premier P2E sports game opportunity. Having a strong brand presence within RKL will help us build legitimacy as a brand and community, as well as build partnerships that extend beyond RKL and into our IRL efforts. \n\nBuilding brand and community seem to be focus points for KH DAO at this point in time - an RKL Club will be one of the highest leverage activities for building brand and community within the metaverse (55.2k current members in the RKL discord). \n\n##### Treasury\nWhile the economic flywheels within RKL have yet to be released, assets within the RKL ecosystem (such as Kongs and Clubs) are a risk-on Treasury diversification strategy at the core. When combined with a broader Treasury strategy that is more conservative, this is precisely the type of opportunity where we should be willing to take on some risk - buying and operating a digital franchise is directly aligned with the mission, vision, and values of the DAO.\n\n### Execution\nThe end game is a grand vision. We must break it down in order to work effectively and at speed, but also ensure we stay within regulatory bounds. At the core, we see a succession of stages getting us moving towards the end vision. A hypothetical path could look like:\n\n1. Purchase RKL Club NFT\na. A separate multi-sig will be created. It will require 3/5 signatures and will be comprised of: jdcook, commodore, flex, eli, and lewwwk (proposal author and 4 stewards)\nb) Funds will be transferred from the KH Treasury to the multi-sig.\nc) Multi-sig will participate in the auction. After the auction, any remaining funds will be sent back to the KH Treasury.\n2. Establish KH RKL Club Workstream\n3. Launch sub-DAO with crowdfund\na. Pay back KH up to its desired ownership stake\nb. Extend the ownership and community of the RKL Club\n4. Create governance structures\na. Imagine GM, Coach, Scout, etc NFTs all with management voting rights and token holders determining who is “hired” and gets to hold those NFTs (as an example)\n5. Build up Club\na. Brand\nb. Roster\nc. Management\n5. Win championships\n\nTo be explicitly clear, this proposal is just for purchasing the RKL Club NFT. While we have a larger vision around a subDAO structure eventually, the path that gives us the most flexibility while also letting us move fast here is having the Krause House Treasury acquire the Club NFT in the Q1 2022 auction.\n\nAfter purchasing a Club NFT, the top priority will be getting a workstream proposal passed to drive the next stages of establishing the Club. It is envisioned that this work team will take on the responsibility of researching the potential options we can take to building and governing the RKL Club, as well as executing on a decided path and getting the Club into a formal governance structure. Also, this work team may take on the responsibility of creating branding and design for the Club, instantiating Club socials, and introducing the Club to the world. The workstream proposal will dictate the final mandates for the team.\n\nAt this point in time, our belief is that a sub-DAO model will be the best approach for the Club. Some of the reasons being:\n\na) we can extend the ownership community beyond KH, thus extending the KH community\nb) we create more flexibility when developing offers for managers and Kongs to sign with our Club\nc) we can build a larger treasury without draining KH treasury funds (through crowdfund)\nd) we can build governance structures for the Club independently from KH\n\nHowever, we want it to be very clear that the purpose of any subsequent workstream will be to fully explore and evaluate the options (including a sub-DAO model) we have for establishing and growing the Club in a way that is: responsible; aligned with the mission, vision and values of the DAO; and is compliant with market and regulatory contexts. We are not committing to a sub-DAO model at this time, but rather indicating this is the leading vision. A leading alternative would be keeping the Club 100% within KH and figuring out governance and management structures within KH for the Club.\n\nIn time, if a subDAO structure is formed, it is likely that external capital will be raised - it is intended that KH can be paid up to 100% of the cost of the acquisition of the RKL Club NFT if we pursue this path. If we determine that it is best to keep the RKL Club 100% within KH, the cost of the NFT will never be paid back, but more value/revenue will flow back to KH.\n\n### Team\n@jdcook#7279\n@josephdcook\nKrause House Club Level / Top 20 Holder of $KRAUSE\nOwner of Kong #1183\nHead of Analytics & Index Council @ Index Coop\n\n@jackjack#9795\n@saxyjacky\nEarly Krause House member / Running KH Website project\nOwner of Kong #7701\n10 year creative advertising vet.

Steph Curry and Paul George will loan their Kongs to our Club. The top sponsors will be fighting for naming rights to the KH RKL Arena. The KH RKL Club token will have the highest valuation of any Club. We will hang trophies and banners.\n\n### Proposal\nWe propose that the Krause House Treasury deploys up to 30 ETH in acquiring a RKL Club NFT in the upcoming Q1 2022 auction. \n\nA separate multi-sig will be created. It will require 3/5 signatures and will comprise: jdcook, commodore, flex, eli, and lewwwk (proposal author and 4 stewards). \n\nFunds will be transferred from the KH Treasury to the multi-sig. Multi-sig will participate in the auction. After the auction, any remaining funds will be sent back to the KH Treasury.\n\nIn the case where the auction does not support Wallet Connect (needed for a multi-sig to participate). We propose that funds are sent to Commodore to participate in the auction on behalf of KH. The same transfer conditions (paragraph above) apply to this process as well. Commodore is a trusted individual within KH and has a significant stake in KH. Both of which should eliminate concern of malicious behavior if this path needed to be taken.\n\nThe purchase of the RKL Club via this proposal is non-binding. Meaning, the multi-sig retains the option to remove itself from the auction and return all funds to the Treasury if at any point it is deemed un-wise to move forward with the purchase of an RKL Club.\n\n",

      "title": "Requesting 5000 $KRAUSE for completed work on new website.",
      "content": "**FUNDING DETAILS:**\n\nWe would like to propose that 5,000 $KRAUSE be allocated for the work already completed on the website refresh. To be paid out in a lump sum after the refresh is launched. This allocation of $KRAUSE will be distributed to the following contributors:\n\n- 75% Jackjack - for refresh content strategy, wireframes, design explorations, website dev/setup and project management.\n- 10% BigBully.eth - for content strategy and copywriting.\n- 10% Peacenode.eth - for illustration design.\n- 5% Greg | Dev / UX - for design explorations.\n\n**GOAL OF PROJECT:**\n\nTo launch a website refresh for krausehouse.club. The project was started in S1 and carried over to S2. There was work done previously, including website content strategy, design explorations, copy development and wireframing. We’re now at a point where we’ve built out a page that’s close to being ready (staging link: https://krause-house.webflow.io/). We’re working on the final touches, and aim to have that ready to go live in the upcoming weeks. This proposal is to create a workstream to compensate the team for the work previously done for the website refresh and for the work needed to finalize the refresh for launch.\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS:**\n\nThe website is what most new users see when they first hear about Krause House. It’s our shot to make a great first impression and show interested people that we’re committed to the mission and are legitimate. The site should reflect the look and feel that we’ve established, and serve as an educational resource for users to learn more about KH before jumping into the discord or purchasing a ticket/$KRAUSE.\n\nThe current Krausehouse.club website is more of a directory than a consumer facing website. The website refresh will help create a user-friendly website experience for new users, and will be a better tool for education and help funnel new users to the right destination.\n\nThere is a Phase 2 proposal in the works for the larger website redesign - that proposal will focus on what features and functionality we think is best to include on the website. The goal will be to build a robust website that incorporates different aspects for what the DAO is doing and offer another platform outside of the discord for members to work in. We’ll go through a proper scoping and planning phase here to determine what those features and functionality should be.\n\n**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\nA nimble internal team composed of JackJack, BigBully.eth and Peacenode.eth are working to finalize the refresh. A staging link ([https://krause-house.webflow.io/](https://krause-house.webflow.io/)) has already been established with the WIP. Once we have finalized the remaining pieces (vetted copy and visual illustrations), we’ll be in a spot to run the refresh by the steward team for final approval.\n\nThe following work has already been completed for the refresh:\n\n- Content strategy and planning (work found on our collab board: [link](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lsiEHRw=/))\n- Lo fidelity wireframes (found in the collab board, direct [link](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lsiEHRw=/?moveToWidget=3074457368043770546&cot=14))\n- Design + Illustrations explorations and development (found within the KH Website channel on the Discord)\n- Copy Development ([link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I-mM2YQeWi22rqhHHmkNkPppyXrQei6qxNPwD_w7QBc/edit?usp=sharing))\n- Staging site setup and development ([https://krause-house.webflow.io/](https://krause-house.webflow.io/))\n\nOnce approved, we’ll need to register for a webflow.io premium account ($35/month) and initiate the domain redirect to the site. Additional users can be created to have access and edit ability to the site.\n\nAfter the refresh is launched, we’ll pivot the workflow to focus on the larger website redesign project: the Phase 2 proposal.\n\nProject lead: JackJack\nSupport: Bigbully.eth\n",

      "content": "---\n\n**TITLE:** Apply for Bancor Whitelist to Seed $KRAUSE Liquidity Pool\n\n**PROJECT LEADS: Kris C.#2965 &** Magnus#3558\n\n---\n\n## **GOAL OF PROJECT:**\n\nTo undertake the Whitelist process to become approved to host an LP Pair on Bancor and seed the KRAUSE/BNT Pool. \n\n## BACKGROUND:\n\nThere is no official LP that has been seeded by Krause House DAO on any AMM. There is only an unofficially seeded LP on Uniswap V3. \n\n## **WHY THIS MATTERS:**\n\nCurrently, on Uniswap-V3 there is ~$47.8k worth of liquidity for KRAUSE/ETH, unfortunately, even if community members wanted to provide liquidity with their KRAUSE and ETH, they would have seen horrifying IL over the last ~1month. \n\nWe propose that KRAUSE apply for whitelisting from the Bancor DAO, and request a **500k $BNT (~$1.6m)** co-investment from the Bancor DAO (subject to DAO vote for whitelisting x co-investment) - this would allow the KRAUSE token to have deeper liquidity. \n\nAnother unique advantage to LP’ing on Bancor is that the protocol has an amazing program wherein users who LP, do not suffer from IL whatsoever. There are also some additional benefits once Bancor V3 is released later in January, which protects LP’s from IL from Day 1. \n\nIn doing so, Krause House DAO deepens its liquidity and protects its community by offering it the best option for liquidity provision in DeFi.\n\n## **HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\nOnce whitelisting is approved (if approved), the treasury would bootstrap the pool with 1,000 BNT worth of KRAUSE (1 BNT at $4.33 = $4,330, so $4,330 worth of KRAUSE). \n\nSnapshot for any proposal goes live every Sunday morning at `11:00 am EST.` Voting is open until Wednesday at `2:00 pm EST`. 1-2 days after the proposal passes, Krause House DAO treasury will bootstrap the pool.\n\n## TIMELINE:\n\nIf this proposal is to pass quorum, the team outlined in this document shall push for the whitelisting process at their discretion.\n\n## BANCOR - What is it?\n\nBancor introduced the first AMM on Ethereum in 2017. Bancor V1 was designed to solve the liquidity problem where thin order books struggled to guarantee liquidity to investors on either side of a trade. The success of AMM’s exposed some key downsides to Liquidity Providers such as Involuntary Token Exposure and Impermanent Loss. \n\nBancor V2.1 offers a solution to the above-mentioned problems:\n\n1. Single-Sided Exposure\n2. Impermanent Loss Insurance\n\nMore details can be found [here](https://docs.bancor.network/getting-started/the-v2-difference).\n\nBancor V3 promises to have even more beneficial features. \n\n## **DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:**\n\n- Krause House to become whitelisted and have the support of Bancor DAO\n- Create our own LP on Bancor for the KRAUSE Token\n- Will be able to proceed with other Treasury affiliated initiatives once LP has been seeded\n\n## RISKS:\n\n- Could be a steep short term price drop from misaligned participants selling\n- There may be some time delay on the whitelisting process - Delaying some progress with other Treasury initiatives\n\n## TEAM:\n\n- Kris C\n- Magnus\n- Mario Lopes\n- Motif\n- Flex Chapman\n\n## DISCLOSURES:\n\nKris C works for a crypto fund, that actively contributes to Enzyme Finance and he personally contributes to the Bancor DAO Marketing Council.",

      "title": "Funding Request For Chinese Mod/中文频道管理员",
      "content": "CN Mods: 0x0513#2882 & MZ0424#3892\n___\n**FUNDING OUTLINE:** \n\n**400 Krause House token/ per month.  200 for each wallet**\n\n每个月共400 Krause House token/每个钱包各200token\n\nSince some members want to know the source of salary. We had a discussion with Stewards team members and here’s the answer, the token we received is from Treasury not from funds raised in the crowdsale.\n\n由于一些社区成员想要知道代币的来源，我们和stewards team的成员讨论后得出了结果，我们收到的代币来自Krause House财政部而非之前募集的资金池。\n\n**WALLET:** \n\n0x20cF2351C22242EdA773962bf628bA2B02680923\n\n0x7E07bEeA829a859345A1e59074264E468dB2cf64\n\n**PROJECT LEADS 项目负责人:** 0x0513#2882, MZ0424#3892\n\n**LENGTH OF TIME ABOUT THIS PROJECT 项目时长**：2 months 2个月\n\n**PROJECT INSPECTORS 项目监督人员**： stewards team and Chinese channel members \n\n核心成员与中文频道成员\n\n**INSPECTORS‘ RESPONSIBILITY 监督人员职责：** To check two project leaders’ performance about their work. Stewards team could cancel modding anytime based on project leaders’ performance. If the inspector approves the results of the project leader's work, then their position can be renewed.\n\n监督两位项目负责人的工作表现。核心小组成员可以基于项目负责人的工作表现在任意时间取消二者的中文频道管理员职位。若监督人员认可项目负责人的工作成果，二者的职位可获得延续。\n\n____ \n\n**GOAL OF PROJECT:**\n\n*Help Chinese community members integrate into KrauseHouse, and help members clearly understand the project progress and daily activities, and other related information, we will encourage the Chinese community to help KH DAO, including retweeting official Twitter account content or another proper way. so that our Chinese channel truly becomes part of helping the project development.*\n\n*帮助大家真正的融入到KrauseHouse这个DAO组织中，并且帮助中文频道成员对于项目进展和日常活动等相关信息有一个清楚的认知，包括但不限于对官方推特账号的点赞或转发等各类形式支持KH DAO，让我们中文频道真正成为帮助项目发展的一部分。*\n\n**WHY THIS MATTERS:**\n\n*The Chinese channel is the most popular channel except for the English channel, but most people's questions are still \"What is the latest progress of the project? \"When will KrauseHouse add liquidity pool\" and other questions that have already been answered, which is partly due to the 'language barrier' and the biased perception of DAO. Since there is no official management of the Chinese channel to communicate and answer questions in Chinese, and there is no person in charge to collect questions and communicating with core team members. These are the main reasons for the current situation.*\n\n*We believe that we can effectively solve the above problems, express the main goals and values of KrauseHouse, which means we can successfully participate in the management and ownership of NBA teams through DAO. Helps Chinese channels to form a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of DAO, and dispel the misunderstanding of DAO in the past. We believe that DAO is not limited to regions, time zones, or countries, and this proposal will better help KH DAO to build a comprehensive and diverse organizational image.*\n\n*中文频道是除英文主频道外人数最多的频道，但多数人的问题依旧停留在“项目方最近有什么进展?” “什么时候添加流动性” 等已有答案的问题, 这种情况不断产生的很大一部分原因是‘语言障碍’和对于DAO的观念偏差原因, 并且中文频道日常也没有官方管理人员使用中文进行交流和答疑，没有相关的负责人可以收集汇总问题跟核心团队成员进行实时的交流对接。这些原因导致了目前中文频道和核心团队偏离的状况。*\n\n*而我们可以有效的解决以上的问题，来帮助项目方传递KH DAO的核心目标与价值观，即通过DAO这一组织形式成功参与管理NBA球队并拥有部分所有权。帮助中文频道对DAO形成更全面深入的了解，化解过往对DAO的误解。我们相信DAO这一组织形式不受限于地区、时区、国家，这一提案能够更好地帮助KH DAO建立全面多元化的组织形象。*\n\n**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\n*Our plan includes but is not limited to this part:*\n\n- *Carry out daily management of the Chinese channel, and promptly answer the questions of channel members to ensure that the channel atmosphere is friendly and harmonious*\n- *Will reach the in-depth collaboration with the \"Scribes Guild\" that will be set up for note-taking & translations in KrauseHouse.*\n- *Translate important announcements from the Steward team and explain them in the Chinese channel*\n- *Participate in important public meetings of KrauseHouse, record the main points and translate them into Chinese to share in the Chinese channel*\n- *For important meetings, the translation team will ask the members of the Chinese community about their opinions and opinions on the recent project progress after sharing the translation content and feed them back to the KH core member team*\n- *Accurately convey the reply from KH Steward Team and help the Chinese community to form effective communication with Steward Team*\n- *If possible, Chinese community accounts will be established on Chinese social media such as Weibo, WeChat, and Hupu to expand the influence of our project and attract more people to participate*\n- *Invite Mr. Cabbage to participate in the meeting with Steward Team, lol*\n\n*我们的计划包括但不仅限于此部分：*\n\n- *对于中文频道进行日常管理，对频道成员的疑问进行及时解答，保证频道气氛友好和谐*\n- *与将要在KrauseHouse建立的负责记录与翻译的“抄写协会”达成深度合作*\n- *及时将团队的重要通知进行翻译并解释分享在中文频道中*\n- *参加KrauseHouse公开的重要会议，记录要点并翻译成中文分享在中文频道中*\n- *对于各类重要会议，翻译团队将分享近期的项目进展后询问中文社区成员对近期项目进展的意见与看法，并反馈给KH核心成员团队*\n- *对KH Steward Team的回复做到准确传达，帮助中文社区与Steward Team形成有效沟通*\n- *如果可以，将在微博、微信、虎扑等中国社交媒体上建立中文社区帐号，扩大我们项目影响力，吸引更多人参与进来*\n- *邀请卷心菜老哥参与Steward Team的对话，lol*\n\n**DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:**\n\n- *100% translation of recent GitHub and snapshot content*\n- *Participate in more than 80% of important meetings and translate key points*\n- *Collect community opinions twice a month and convey them to Steward Team*\n- *Popularize the basic knowledge and organizational framework of KrauseHouse, so that more Chinese channel members can participate in the KrauseHouse sub-team*\n\n- *100%翻译近期GitHub和snapshot内容*\n- *参与80%以上的重要会议并进行要点记录翻译*\n- 一个月内*每两周收集一次社区意见总结，传达给Steward Team*\n- *普及KrauseHouse的基本知识与组织框架，让更多中文频道成员参与到KrauseHouse sub team*\n\n**TEAM:**\n\n*Why will you succeed? What is your expertise, experience, or ethos?*\n\n*I, MZ0424, have been engaged in the operation of Chinese social media platform accounts (Xiaohongshu, Tiktok), during my employment, I have reached 1000+ likes and 6000+ plays for a single short video, understand the rules about content communication on social media platforms. I also have experience in the translation of Japanese animation and variety shows for my hobby.*\n\n*本人MZ0424曾从事过中文自媒体平台账号的运营工作(小红书、抖音），在职期间曾达到单个短视频点赞数1000+、播放量6000+，对社交媒体平台内容传播具有一定的理解和经验。曾出于兴趣爱好参与日文动画、综艺节目的翻译工作。*\n\n*I am 0x0513. I have studied in Canada for many years and now work full-time in blockchain-related fields. I am mainly responsible for social media platform account operation, community management, and other related work. I have been deeply involved in multiple NFT and DAO projects and have worked as a moderator in multiple communities.*\n\n*The above experience is relevant to our proposal, and I believe it can play a supporting role in achieving the goal.*\n\n*本人0x0513，在加拿大留学多年并现在全职工作于区块链相关领域，主要负责海外社交媒体平台账号运营/社区管理等相关的工作，并且深度参与于多个NFT和DAO项目并曾在多个社区群组担任管理职务。*\n\n*上述经验与我们的提案具有相关性，相信能够为达成目标起到辅助作用。*\n ",

We want to take this a step further and evolve this into the following:\n\n1) a recursive matchmaking system that allows for better facilitation of member skills & available projects.\n\n2) a system driven by Agents that will go beyond an initial touchpoint with any given member. We will have Agents assigned to cohorts of KH members and a CRM to track member progress for follow ups.\n\n### Use of Funds\n\nThese will be distributed end of each month based on people’s Points in the Onboarding [Scoreboard](https://www.notion.so/Onboarding-via-Agent-Model-352763af8d6446dbaae9f1abbf6e9cdf).\n\nNOTE: Mario will be ineligible to receive any project funds.\n\n- **FIXED:** Each Agent who has 5 hours of one-on-one call time **available** each week will get 10 $KRAUSE week.\n- **VARIABLE:** Commissions of 50 $KRAUSE are available for any Agent that converts a DAO member into a Contributor (see definition [here](https://www.notion.so/Requesting-5000-USDC-and-3000-KRAUSE-per-month-to-run-an-Onboarding-Project-via-an-Agent-Model-2cf52148ccc6441e9f2f8c7dc805eb64)) as tracked in the [Agent CRM](https://www.notion.so/Agent-s-CRM-bb68f4e9e8ac41aab0385006045eb2ba).\n    - Paid out at end of February\n    - If the 3000 $KRAUSE is fully paid out because we convert 60 members into Contributors, we will pay out the remaining commissions in USDC at a rate of 100 USDC for every converted Contributor",

The framework we develop will help the DAO validate decisions from a brand perspective.  The brand assets we develop will drive the style, design aesthetic and creative direction of Krause House moving forward. Read more [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XDTAnENs-V-JIquULwpnLao-NkjE36An/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113928771782986979836&rtpof=true&sd=true).  \n\n**TEAM:**\nAcross the team is a unique blend of passion for Krause House, Web3, and the NBA as well as a combined 30+ years of experience in brand marketing, product development, and entrepreneurship. \n\n**FUNDING DETAILS:**\nWe propose compensation of 2000 $KRAUSE per week during the season for a duration of four weeks for a total of 8000 $KRAUSE in compensation.  Additionally, we are requesting $15K USDC for asset design paid either as bounties to Jerrys or to an external.  While there is a voting option to do a secondary proposal for the $15K, we strongly recommend giving the team access to this up-front, which will give us speed and flexibility in asset design.\n\n**HOW THIS WILL BE DONE:**\n\nA branding framework will be created that will allow any DAO member to feel confident that a public-facing initiative could leave a positive impression on any viewer. Additionally, this project would create brand guidelines/assets and deliver oversight in the various projects occurring across the DAO such as #nft-experiences, #merchandise, #nola-grassroots, #partnerships, #media, and other discussions.  A copy of our current work (still draft) of the Brand Framework can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W9BWra4ZPI5ZkAxCoTXvnUnt_LXGW12u/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107658520907878001063&rtpof=true&sd=true).  Assets would include logos, fonts, icons and a general styleguide that can be used across the DAO.\n\n**DEFINITION OF SUCCESS:**\n\nDelivery of high-quality brand framework (including Brand Positioning, Values, User Targets etc), guidelines, assets, and brand leadership would define the lion’s share of success for this project. As part of this proposal, the Krause House stewards reserve the right to withhold the fund stream for low-quality content produced by this project.",

Currently, it is a general NBA-talk channel that generally has 0-10 messages every day. This trial will see if we can increase this – we want #nba-banter to be the go-to place people go to when discussing NBA related matters. Building a sense of belonging to Krause House will have long-term benefits for the DAO.\n\n![Inspo](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/BN_kI2cD6j9zTxEM7RM6J_9Rphz_kTkZx3vniFfal8d9h7CdZeL6viEjyHbIf8NFDMAct4SU-5uZVPtHey8j1hI2ORTunL5jBycHcBHVvprb969XOHvkJucQlBl6EUSZGabGvBF0)\n\n**Project specific details**\n\nFor 6 days of the week, either @views or @g0dex will be the content provider toward #nba-banter. This can be in the form of Streamable highlights, tweets, or any other relevant online content. The minimum for every day is 3 pieces of content to provide by either @views or @g0dex.\n\nOne day of the week will be the “rest” day, where there is no content provided by either @views or @g0dex. This is further discussed in the section below.\n\n**Defining success**\n\nWe want #nba-banter to be the default place people go to while watching games, or even for general NBA content. We don’t have a hard metric of # of messages in the #nba-banter channel every day (can be easily gamed). Instead, we view success in terms of people taking initiative to post by themselves – not as reactions to content posted by @views or @g0dex. Maybe people will even start posting highlights / other content regularly themselves!\n\nHowever, one way to measure success is for a light A/B test during the month trial. So, for 6 days of the week content will be provided, while there is 1 “rest” day. After the trial is up, we will tally up engagement activity for every day of the month and see if there are significant differences.\n\n**After the trial**\n\nAfter 1 month, how do we keep #nba-banter engaging? Perhaps it is to have a couple people on a workstream to engage with others. Another, more ideal case would be for organic activity unrelated to any workstream.\n\n**Funding details:**\n\nCompensation will be split evenly between @views and @g0dex.",

Mainnet Safe Sends to EOA (normal wallet)\n2. EOA bridges to Polygon\n3. EOA (now on Polygon) sends to Safe on Polygon\n\nHowever, this adds an attack space where the EOA could run away with the funds.  **In the spirit of transparency and consent, we are requesting the community signals approval to the Transaction Team’s proposed solution.**\n\n## **Proposed Solution — Commodore bridges funds from an EOA and sends to Krause House’s Polygon Safe.**\n\n**Why this is low risk.**\n\n- Commodore has just quit his job to work full time on Krause House, and therefore a move to act maliciously would lead to the cancelling of his [contract]([https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x99aa0687b4e443a59b71f32f45df2ec4f899afdc1bccb88612fa5de4ddd6440d](https://snapshot.org/#/krausehouse.eth/proposal/0x99aa0687b4e443a59b71f32f45df2ec4f899afdc1bccb88612fa5de4ddd6440d))\n- Even with a larger supply of tokens, no moves can be made on the Treasury singlehanded.\n- If the worst case, the community could fork the token, cancelling Commodore’s supply.\n- If the intent was to sell any stolen tokens before any potential fork, the liquidity is too low to do so.\n\n**Why Commodore?**\n\nAs a creator of Krause House, trusted member of the community, Commodore is the ideal party to do so.  For context, on completion of our [Genesis Edition Ticket Sale](), an issue with Mirror sent the entire token supply to Commodore’s wallet, who immediately moved the funds to the multisig where they should have been.\n\n### In the case this doesn’t pass.\nIf this doesn’t pass, funds will be temporarily held up while we find a working solution.  This will set back plans to get contributors on L2 streams.",

      "title": "Deploy up to 70 ETH in acquiring a Rumble Kongs League Club NFT in the upcoming Q1 2022 auction.",
      "content": "[Link to Full Proposal](https://github.com/Krause-House/proposals/blob/main/krause-house-rumble-kong-club.md)\n\n# Proposal\n**Krause House Treasury deploys up to 70 ETH in acquiring a RKL Club NFT in the upcoming Q1 2022 auction**.\n\nA separate multi-sig will be created. It will require 3/5 signatures and will comprise: jdcook, commodore, flex, eli, and lewwwk (proposal author and 4 stewards).\n\nFunds will be transferred from the KH Treasury to the multi-sig. Multi-sig will participate in the auction. After the auction, any remaining funds will be sent back to the KH Treasury.\n\nIn the case where the auction does not support Wallet Connect (needed for a multi-sig to participate). We propose that funds are sent to Commodore to participate in the auction on behalf of KH. The same transfer conditions (paragraph above) apply to this process as well. Commodore is a trusted individual within KH and has a significant stake in KH. Both of which should eliminate concern of malicious behavior if this path needed to be taken.\n\nThe purchase of the RKL Club via this proposal is non-binding. Meaning, the multi-sig retains the option to remove itself from the auction and return all funds to the Treasury if at any point it is deemed un-wise to move forward with the purchase of an RKL Club.\n\n\n# Summary\n\nWe envision Krause House being a major owner (and the brand) behind a top-tier Rumble Kong Club. We envision this Club as a sub-DAO of Krause House, with its own token (liquid ownership). This will allow us to build a strong community and treasury for the Club to be used to aggressively attack Club operations and management. We envision the KH RKL Club signing top Kongs, partnership with big brand sponsorships, driving revenue, captivating a fanbase, and ultimately - winning championships. Owning and managing a digital franchise is an important iteration for Krause House while on it’s path to buying ownership stakes in IRL franchises.\n\nWhile this is a lofty vision, it starts with**acquiring a RKL Club NFT**, which is the focus of this proposal. It is intended for future proposals to focus on launching a work stream for all the effort that will be required to establish the Club. But for now, the best path forward (as we explore the sub-DAO design space for both regulatory and effectiveness purposes) is to propose that the KH Treasury funds the acquisition of a RKL Club in the first auction (Q1 2022).\n\n**We propose that the Krause House Treasury deploys up to 70 ETH in acquiring a RKL Club NFT in the upcoming Q1 2022 auction**. 70 ETH will be moved to a multi-sig where jdcook (author of proposal) and 4 stewards are owners - this multi-sig will participate in the auction. In time, a subDAO structure may be proposed and it is likely that external capital will be raised - it is intended that KH could be paid back up to 100% of the cost of the acquisition of the RKL Club NFT.\n\n\n# Background\n\nRumble Kong League (RKL) is the metaverse’s basketball league. Rumble Kong’s are programmatically generated, unique (10,000) NFTs that represent playable avatars. Each Kong has built-in stats/skills as well as visual rarities. The [RKL team just raised $4.5m](https://rumblekongleague.substack.com/p/rumble-kong-league-raises-45m-in?justPublished=true) to continue to create the premier play-to-earn sports game. Rumble Kong’s rank #15 in trade volume on OpenSea [over the past 7 days](https://opensea.io/rankings?sortBy=seven_day_volume).[Steph Curry](https://twitter.com/boardroom/status/1461697271280635910?s=20) and [Paul George](https://twitter.com/boardroom/status/1467579569830076424?s=21) are among the NBA players that have now purchased a Kong.\n\nRKL recently announced the [launch of Clubs](https://rumblekongleague.substack.com/p/introducing-rkl-clubs). Clubs will be at the center of gameplay and the play-to-earn economy within RKL. Individual Kongs will sign on-chain contracts with Clubs. Clubs will deploy teams to play in different divisions. Thus, the revenue flow within the game flows through Clubs. Clubs will be major brands, sign sponsorship deals, create merchandise, and build fanbases.\n\nJust as IRL franchises are in our sights, digital franchises should be as well.\n\n\n# Value Proposition\n\nBroadly, we have a lot to explore and learn as we pursue our goals of purchasing and managing stakes in sports franchises:\n\n- Regulatory structures\n- Fundraising\n- Value transfer to/from Krause House\n- Governance\n- Management\n- Community\n\nAn RKL Club will allow us to experiment with all. Specifically, we want to highlight how an RKL Club aligns with the vision, mission, and values of the Krause House DAO across sports operations, governance, brand & community, and treasury.\n\n\n### Sports Operations\n\nAn RKL Club gives us a lower-risk environment (thinking on the scale of hundreds of thousands of dollars vs tens of millions of dollars) to explore, iterate, and learn how to operate a sports franchise. RKL Clubs will need all of the following functions:\n\n* Scouting\n* Analytics\n* General Management\n* Coaching\n* Brand / Design\n* Social\n* Merchandise\n* Partnerships\n* Sponsorships\n* Events\n\nThere is quite a bit about the game that is still to be determined (see the [whitepaper](https://www.rumblekongleague.com/assets/kongpaper.pdf)). We know that Clubs will sign on-chain contracts with players. Clubs will be responsible for managing rosters and fielding teams in leagues. Clubs will sign partnerships and sponsorships within the metaverse. Clubs will build brands, community, and fanbases. Clubs will seek to win championships and hang banners and trophies.\n\nAll of the functions in the list above overlap directly with operations that will need to exist in the management of an IRL team (shoutout to the group working on the [Decentralized Sports Operations (DSO) Stream](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MWVHKhhU5FicFrK-XUqP4CH4idsHd9Fnj0eHh6Hh61g/edit?usp=sharing) proposal). Obviously there will be differences - this is not an IRL team. However, an RKL Club can be a go-to option for testing hypotheses and running experiments as we build out capabilities to manage an IRL team.\n\n\n### Governance\n\nHow will governance flow into sports operations? Will there be a layer of base token voting? On what decisions? What will be delegated off of governance and onto specific roles (i.e. GM, or Coach)? There are a lot of open questions around the best structures to marry fractional ownership and governance of a sports franchise with the actual management of the sports franchise.\n\nGovernance is already difficult within Web3 and DAOs. By the time KH buys IRL stakes, we better have some strong governance and management primitives ready to employ - an IRL stake is not the best for experimentation given the high stakes associated. An RKL Club lets us start working in the governance design space immediately, maybe even running through multiple iterations.\n\n\n### Brand & Community\n\nIt is an incredible opportunity to build our brand and expand our community. As of now, RKL is the premier P2E sports game opportunity. Having a strong brand presence within RKL will help us build legitimacy as a brand and community, as well as build partnerships that extend beyond RKL and into our IRL efforts.\n\nBuilding brand and community seem to be focus points for KH DAO at this point in time - an RKL Club will be one of the highest leverage activities for building brand and community within the metaverse (55.2k current members in the RKL discord).\n\n\n### Treasury\n\nWhile the economic flywheels within RKL have yet to be released, assets within the RKL ecosystem (such as Kongs and Clubs) are a risk-on Treasury diversification strategy at the core. When combined with a broader Treasury strategy that is more conservative, this is precisely the type of opportunity where we should be willing to take on some risk - buying and operating a digital franchise is directly aligned with the mission, vision, and values of the DAO.\n\n\n# Execution\n\nThe end game is a grand vision. We must break it down in order to work effectively and at speed, but also ensure we stay within regulatory bounds. At the core, we see a succession of stages getting us moving towards the end vision. A hypothetical path *could* look like:\n\n1. **Purchase RKL Club NFT**\n\n   a. A separate multi-sig will be created. It will require 3/5 signatures and will be comprised of: jdcook, commodore, flex, eli, and lewwwk (proposal author and 4 stewards)\n   \n   b. Funds will be transferred from the KH Treasury to the multi-sig.\n\n   c. Multi-sig will participate in the auction. After the auction, any remaining funds will be sent back to the KH Treasury.\n\n2. Establish KH RKL Club Workstream\n\n3. Launch sub-DAO with crowdfund\n\n   a. Pay back KH up to its desired ownership stake\n   \n   b. Extend the ownership and community of the RKL Club\n\n4. Create governance structures\n\n   a. Imagine GM, Coach, Scout, etc NFTs all with management voting rights and token holders determining who is “hired” and gets to hold those NFTs (as an example)\n\n5. Build up Club\n\n   a. Brand\n   \n   b. Roster\n   \n   c. Management\n\n6. Win championships\n\nTo be explicitly clear, this proposal is **just for purchasing the RKL Club NFT**. While we have a larger vision around a subDAO structure eventually, the path that gives us the most flexibility while also letting us move fast here is having the Krause House Treasury acquire the Club NFT in the Q1 2022 auction.\n\nAfter purchasing a Club NFT, the top priority will be getting a work stream proposal passed to drive the next stages of establishing the Club. It is envisioned that this work team will take on the responsibility of researching the potential options we can take to building and governing the RKL Club, as well as executing on a decided path and getting the Club into a formal governance structure. Also, this work team may take on the responsibility of creating branding and design for the Club, instantiating Club socials, and introducing the Club to the world. The work stream proposal will dictate the final mandates for the team.\n\nAt this point in time, our belief is that a sub-DAO model will be the best approach for the Club. Some of the reasons being:\n\n1. we can extend the ownership community beyond KH, thus extending the KH community\n2. we create more flexibility when developing offers for managers and Kongs to sign with our Club\n3. we can build a larger treasury without draining KH treasury funds (through crowdfund)\n4. we can build governance structures for the Club independently from KH\n\nHowever, we want it to be very clear that the purpose of any subsequent workstream will be to fully explore and evaluate the options (including a sub-DAO model) we have for establishing and growing the Club in a way that is: responsible; aligned with the mission, vision and values of the DAO; and is compliant with market and regulatory contexts. We are not committing to a sub-DAO model at this time, but rather indicating this is the leading vision. A leading alternative would be keeping the Club 100% within KH and figuring out governance and management structures within KH for the Club.\n\nIn time, if a subDAO structure is formed, it is likely that external capital will be raised - it is intended that KH can be paid up to 100% of the cost of the acquisition of the RKL Club NFT if we pursue this path. If we determine that it is best to keep the RKL Club 100% within KH, the cost of the NFT will never be paid back, but more value/revenue will flow back to KH.\n\n\n# Hype\nKrause House will be the brand behind the biggest RKL Club in the game. Steph Curry and Paul George will loan their Kongs to our Club. The top sponsors will be fighting for naming rights to the KH RKL Arena. The KH RKL Club token will have the highest valuation of any Club.**We will hang trophies and banners.**",

Polygon allows us to bridge tokens back and forth to chain with cheaper gas fees, allowing us to avoid gas concerns and pay contributors how they'd like with negligible transaction fees.

      "title": "Fund Initial Full-Time Team (4 Months)",
      "content": "## Goal\n\nWe believe that we need a handful of people to make a full-time commitment to Krause House to rapidly achieve our mission. This was outlined in the original Mirror post & has been strongly advised to us by advisors + peers from popular DAOs. The intention is to ensure we have a core group of contributors with high context, talent, & responsibility for the success of Krause House. A core function of these full-time contributors will be to spin up & scale fundamental systems within Krause House with the intention of establishing long-term decentralized systems. Any full time contributor is not only beholden to their fellow full-time contributors, but the broader community at any time as well.\n\n\n## Proposal\n\nSet aside a monthly budget of $42,501 USDC + 17,500 $KRAUSE to fund an initial set of full-time contributors. Budgets and responsibilities for each contributor are outlined below, and will be paid monthly, starting immediately after proposal passing. Contributors can be fired at any point by the DAO through proposal, at which point future payments will cease.\n\nMembers of this team must retain 100% of their existing $KRAUSE balances for 2 years or until no longer being compensated as a full-time contributor.\n\n**Monthly**\n\n| **Name**     | **Style**        | **$USDC**  | **$KRAUSE** |\n| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------- | ----------- |\n| Commodore    | Fixed            | 16,667     | 0           |\n| Flex Chapman | Fixed            | 16,667     | 0           |\n| Mario Lopes  | Fixed            | 9,167      | 7,500       |\n| Eli          | Hybrid / Dynamic | 0          | 10,000      |\n| **Total**    |                  | **42,501** | **17,500**  |\n\n\n## Why?\n\nKrause House is scaling rapidly. Bounties & project compensation works well for certain types of work, but does not fit as well with things like operations or emergent opportunities / problems. Additionally, managing bounties and less active contributors is a significant resource spend. Having a set of full-time contributors insures the DAO against stagnation, and allows for a much richer level of commitment and context. Additionally, now that the treasury has a material amount of funds, continuity and stability over a longer time horizon is an important component of our ability to achieve our mission. We’ve consulted with our most trusted advisors & the group is unanimous in wanting a core full-time team pursuing the mission of Krause House.\n\n\n## Why this team?\n\nThis list of contributors consists of X highly active contributors, 2 of which (Flex Chapman and Commodore) summoned the DAO. The 2 others (Mario Lopes and eli\\_) began contributing to Krause House in July without pay and have taken it upon themselves to build and maintain core systems of onboarding and governance design. Throughout this time, this team participated in Seed Club and led the launch of Krause House’s crowdfund. These Jerry’s have defined and demonstrated consistent alignment with Krause House’s core values.\n\n\n## How long?\n\nWe propose 4 months (effectively 2 seasons) to give us enough time to deliver against large milestones and also some stability with our work lives. We think it’s important for the community to have the option to cancel this arrangement quickly in the event it’s not working for Krause House. The community at any time can issue a proposal to remove one or all from the team. Assuming this arrangement is working well for the community, the intention will be to renew this arrangement.\n\n\n## Compensation Structures\n\nEach full-time contributor can decide between 2 compensation structures:\n\n**Fixed**\n\nPaid at an agreed upon salary amount in a stablecoin. The salary amount will be generally market rate. The full-time contributor cannot earn additional compensation by participating in projects within Krause House.\n\n**Hybrid / Dynamic**\n\nA base salary (50% of market) would be paid in a stablecoin. The full-time contributor would be able to participate in compensation within other projects that are approved by the community via Snapshot.\n\n\n## Additional Details\n\nEach of these contributors is required to hold their entire existing $KRAUSE balance in order to receive payment. Payments will be made monthly. In order to be eligible for the payment, the recipient's wallet address must still be holding the required amount of tokens to meet the obligation of 100% existing $KRAUSE tokens are being held. To be specific, “existing $KRAUSE” is defined as the quantity the team member received from the KH Community Airdrop allocation. To be extra clear, if the team member is earning $KRAUSE as part of their monthly compensation — those tokens_are not_ subjected to being locked. In the event a team member is removed from the team, their tokens are fully unlocked effective immediately.\n\nThis compensation structure is meant to be an experiment that we’ll continue to assess & improve over time.\n\nThis team will hold a monthly review with the Stewardship Team to make sure the workflows are being successfully delivered against.\n\n## [Link to Full Details Here](https://github.com/Krause-House/proposals/blob/1469c4e66778fff60d28326bd9c6d5bbd63e0dd3/full-time-contributors-211221.md)",

I propose that a portion of ETH raised via the Mirror Crowdsale be converted into stablecoins. \n\nThe stablecoin I propose we convert to is [USDC](https://blog.coinbase.com/fact-check-usd-coin-is-the-largest-regulated-stablecoin-in-the-world-6e7f3c06cbf0) since it is a regulated store of value instrument. The issuer of USDC, Circle is subject to 46 state regulators which conduct frequent exams of Circle's activities. This should help the DAO remain compliant from a regulatory standpoint as the goal of attaining an ownership stake in a NBA Team will require for Krause House to maintain a clean image and not convey the wrong message to the world outside of Web3. \n\nThe conversion of assets should consist of a decent amount to ensure adequate runway in the foreseeable future. There should also be consideration for providing a portion of liquidity to seeding any Liquidity Pools that the DAO decides to deploy.\n\n\n## Details\nI believe that in order for the DAO to succeed in the long term it is imperative that funds be converted into stable assets. It would be difficult to project and forecast operation, development and promotional costs if the DAO was to remain in a constantly fluctuating asset such as ETH. \n\nAlthough my biases tell me to remain in Ethereum to capture the prospective upside, I hope DAO members can understand that this is not a personal portfolio to take risks with. We should secure the runway to weather any type of market, bull or bear. \n\nBy undertaking this diversification we will be taking risk off and ensure there is ample funds in the treasury for the long term.\n\n## Diversification Options\nConvert to the ratios of:\n\n1. 95% USDC and 5% ETH\n\n2. 80% USDC and 20% ETH\n\n3. 60% USDC and 40% ETH\n\n4. 100% ETH \n\nProvided various options as DAO members may have differing opinions. Left the 5% of ETH in the interest of gas costs and multi-sig transactions - Understandably is a very large amount of ETH to play with but happy to hear everyone's feedback.",

      "title": "Project Proposal: DAO Operations Tooling",
      "content": "**TITLE:** Funding Request to Build Operations Tooling\n\n**REWARD:** 2k KRAUSE seed funding. Additional 4k KRAUSE for 5 projects still using Command Center after 3 months\n\n**WALLET:** 0xD27968F4444E62D329bFdd3C423Dbed05bFdFc62\n\n**PROJECT LEADS:** Mario Lopes#2725, Dogstoevsky#0585\n\n**SCOPE OF WORK:**\n\nThis project will see the migration of all other Krause House projects to a custom Notion tool that will streamline information and task management.\n\nSome key planned features will be:\n\n- Acting as a central repository for the DAO and for each individual project\n- Project management pages to help Team Leads track work and contributions\n- Represent the DAO to new members, showcasing ongoing work and allowing easier onboarding\n\nThe tooling to be implemented has already been through multiple iterations, and we anticipate it going through several more. This project could span several months and could in theory never reach its success criteria (thus never unlocking the 4000 $KRAUSE reward for the team).\n\n**SUCCESS:**\n\nThe success of this project can be determined by whether or not this tooling is adopted by a critical mass of teams across the DAO. If 5+ teams are using this tooling for any meaningful length of time, it can be fairly assumed that the tool it is providing value and thus was a success.\n\nAt the point of 5 projects using this tooling (for at least 3 months, or for the project's entire duration if it is a short-term initiative), this Operations Tooling Project will be paid out 4000 $KRAUSE as a reward for its contributions to Krause House. This 4000 $KRAUSE will be divided amongst the project leads (Dogstoevsky and Mario Lopes) and any contributors who participated. If after 3 months this tooling is still in use by at least 5 projects, an additional 4000 $KRAUSE will be unlocked for this team.\n\n**DEFINITIONS:**\n\n*Using*\n\nWhen we talk about projects “using” this tooling, we are primarily talking about housing deliverables/tasks, documents, and other information on this and regularly referring back to it. If a project is tracking their tasks in our Kanban board and assigning Credit to contributors, that’s using it. If a project is using our tooling to track documents, meeting minutes, and generally making it their central repository, that’s also meaningfully using it.\n\nIn short, we’d need to see a project either using this tooling as their main source of information management, or main source of project management, or both. Using this is *not* a project that has several ongoing tasks using this tooling for just 10-20% of them and keeping documents in a Google Drive. It’s also *not* an active project referring back to it once every 3 weeks because they just don’t need it.\n\n*Custom*\n\nWe call this a custom Notion tool because of several people who have slaved away to build and test it. It’s not using fancy integrations. It’s pure vanilla Notion. It was still custom-built for Krause House and is aiming to solve problems that nothing before it could (the info and project management issues).",

      "title": "G League Exploration",
      "content": "**Goal**\n\nThe goal for the G League Ownership Exploration project (less terrible name pending) is to serve as a feasibility study for KH's entry into the G League as a team owner. Though the primary goal is exploratory in nature, we also hope to establish relationships within the G League community that could progress beyond the original scope of the project. Our hope with the project is to:\n\n1. Gain a robust understanding of the relevant factors impacting team ownership, including regulatory, economic, and technical aspects\n2. Connect with G League owners, front office employees, and other relevant parties to glean insights on best practices and DAO ownership possibilities\n3. Establish initial relationships within the G League community to get KH on the radar for future opportunities\n\nWe hope to build off of the exploratory memo I assembled with input from other community members [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-8ceRyawhQ24m-WA-VGZjhJmnE986Hq59r8oe44TOBw/edit).\n\n**Proposed Deliverables and Work**\n\nBy the end of Season 2, we hope to produce the following items and outcomes:\n\n1. A report detailing the various paths to ownerships, the implications of each approach, potential targets, capital requirements, League considerations, and tangible next steps for each approach depending on what the DAO views as the most attainable/desirable\n2. Collateral, in the form of a one-pager or similar marketing material, detailing the add value Krause House provides to potential partners, including but not limited to the G League. This collateral will supplement our outreach to G League stakeholders and can be used for tangentially related outreach campaigns to other leagues like the WNBA\n3. Depending on the interest from G League and organizations, we hope to forge new relationships via cold outreach and warm connections surfaced from the DAO’s members. We hope these relationships will yield feedback on what the DAO would need to do to be seriously considered as an owner\n    1. Ideally, we will make contact with pertinent stakeholders and convince them to meet with us via video calls. In this case, we can source questions from KH contributors and record the calls to glean insights\n\n**Add Value to Krause House**\n\nAs a result of this exploration, we hope to provide the DAO with a better understanding of what each path to G League ownership would entail, as well as the relevant implication of each. We also hope to produce external-facing collateral to share with potential partners (within the G League and beyond) detailing the add-value KH brings to organizations and leagues. Should we succeed in speaking to relevant G League stakeholders, the DAO would greatly benefit from the insights and validation derived from said conversations.\n\n**Add Value to the G League**\n\nThrough a DAO ownership model, the G League can enable millions of basketball fans the chance to own and meaningfully influence the decisions of a professional basketball franchise. By opening itself up to DAO ownership, the league will increase awareness, engagement, and evangelization of a franchise, as well as the league broadly. Tangibly, this will result in increased TV viewership, merchandise sales, and ticket revenue, among other monetary benefits. Partnering with a DAO also serves as a portal to Web3, enabling the NBA to experiment with new forms of progressive, community-focused governance/ownership structures. Additionally, the league can leverage the DAO and its Web3 native members to launch revenue-generating projects such as NFTs, play-to-earn games, and betting platforms.\n\n**Team**\n\nThe effort will be co-led by myself (matt #0908) as well as Brandan (Brandan #3793). In the coming days, I will look to amass a larger team of contributors through the appropriate Discord channels. We will use the allocated compensation to incentivize contribution via bounties or to-do tasks.\n\n**Compensation**\n\nWe are requesting **300 $KRAUSE** as a base compensation to complete the aforementioned work. To further incentivize our project team to exceed base goals, we are proposing the following milestone-based compensation:\n\n- **1,000 $KRAUSE** for a recorded video call(s) with an ownership representative of a franchise, front office executive of a franchise, league office representative (managerial level or above, or anyone in the the partnerships division)\n- **1,000 $KRAUSE for a Discord (or similar platform) AMA from an ownership representative of a franchise, front office executive of a franchise, league office representative (managerial level or above, or anyone in the the partnerships division)**\n\nReward compensation will be capped at 2,000 $KRAUSE total (1,000 for a call and AMA respectively). \n\nLet's ride.",

Barring serious injury, Steph will reach the milestone sometime during the 2021 - 2022 season.\n\nIdea: The plan is to create a contest to allow Krause House ticket holders to guess when Steph Curry will surpass Ray Allen. The goal of this contest is to build off of the successful NFT launch and create a unique experience for ticket holders. Additionally, we want to leverage the positive momentum within the Krause House to create additional opportunities for community engagement through friendly competition.\n\nMain work to be completed: finalize contest design, collect entries, manage a leaderboard and post updates on Discord, design and distribute POAP to all contestants. \n\n**RELEVANT LINKS:**\n\nDetails for contest rules: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s2BDNWkHi_gsxYJsJAD3P1-VJO0fmAdHOKPv5_PDuUU/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\n**ADDITIONAL INFO:**\n\nEach Krause House Ticket holder will be allowed one entry. All contestants will receive a POAP for participating. Official bragging rights will go to the person who guesses when Steph surpasses the record.\n\nFunds to be delivered to TradeMark following completion of the contest. I will work out distribution of those funds to other potential collaborators, as needed.",

The Stewardship Team will consist of 8 high-context members who will provide leadership and direction to the DAO, establish priorities, and help manage proposals and expensive projects on behalf of all members. The ST will be able to solve key problems within Krause House such as developing a clear roadmap or DAO-wide understanding of what projects are most urgent. The ST will also be a robust team that can protect against potential future issues like hostile whale takeovers or Sybil attacks. This team would be compensated on a biweekly basis (every 2 weeks) and members could be elected or removed based on community voting.\n\nDETAILS\n\nhttps://github.com/Krause-House/proposals/blob/main/stewardship-team-12042021.md",
