All at once!!!\n\nFor this reason we present the following options:\n\n1. Sell all 11 sewer passes at current market value. \n\n2. Sell 2/3 of passes at market value (6x Tier1 and 2x Tier4). Play and mint on final 1/3 (2x tier 1 and 1x tier 4).\n\n3. Sell 1/3 of passes at market value (3x Tier1 and 1x Tier4). \nRaffle 1/3 to community at 20% market discount. (3x Tier1 and 1x Tier4).\nPlay and mint on final 1/3 (2x Tier1 and 1x Tier4).\n\n4. Play for a score (Higher than 0) to mint on all 11 passes.\n\nAlso, before you vote I want to make a few notes:\n\n- Selling passes: Sales will occur after the vote end at the current prices by then.\n- Raffling passes: We will open a registration process where every holder can participate, if you participate means you agreeing on paying the DAO a 80% of the value of the sewer pass after the raffle.\n- Playing the game: Is important to know that we will try to let people play if this option wins, but the main priority would be THE SECURITY of the vault. For this reason, if this options wins, and we end up not finding a SAFE solution for the community to play the game, we would try to score more than 0 point (the minimum in order to mint) and that's it.\n\nSaid this, it's time to vote!!!",

      "content": "It is time for us to start planning our presence and engagement level for NTF NYC 2023. The conference will take place April 12-14, in New York City.\n\n\nIn order to secure our official sponsorship and participation at the currently discounted rates we would like to approve a general budget early so we can plan and organize things in advance and be as efficient as possible.\n\n\nTo that end we would like to propose a total initial budget for the event of $35k USDC. This would include our event sponsorship, entry passes, a scheduled offsite MC meetup event, props, banners, and all other promotional print materials. \n\nThe proposed budget would be a 33% reduction from last years budgets. All major expenses will be tracked and documented and any unused budget would remain in the DAO treasury. \n\nShould we approve the prosed budget of 35k USDC for the NFT NYC event?",

      "content": "After a few days of discussion, we are finally ready to vote on the #superrare proposal.  \n\nFirst, \nWe are introducing “Weighted Vote”.  1 Cat is still 1 Vote.  However, you would be able to distribute your votes among more than 1 option if you wish.  In this case, you have 5 options to choose (listed below), and you can distribute as many MCs as you own between the options.  So for example, if you own 10 MCs, you can vote five cats for option 1, two cats for option 4, and three cats for option 5. You can also distribute your votes between all the options, Snapshot would prorate your MCs and you might see you voted 5.4 cats for one option as an example - nothing to worry, Snapshot is a percentage voting system so that’s perfectly fine.\n\nSecondly, \nbased on the discussion we had, the following 5 options are available:\n\n1. Do not participate in the RarePass auction\n\n2. Participate in Dutch auction for one regular RarePass with a max budget 35 ETH\n\n3. Participate in Dutch auction for one regular RarePass with a max budget 50 ETH \n\n4. Participate in Dutch auction for two regular RarePasses with a max budget of 100 ETH\n\n5. Participate in auction for RarePass #1 up to 60 ETH and in Dutch auction for one regular RarePass with a max budget 40 ETH (Total 100 ETH)\n\nPlease, vote carefully and if you have any question feel free to ask in the #superrare proposal channel in our Discord.

      "content": "We’ve been approached with an interesting proposal that we would like to share with the community and ultimately put up for a vote. The team has been in conversations with an independent investor that is involved in one of the biggest Web3/Gaming companies in the world. This person is excited with the direction we are taking with IP creation and the project in general and has inquired about buying a sizable allotment of cats from the DAO treasury. He has also committed verbally to not list any cats in the near term while we work on building the project. This relationship could have the opportunity to open some interesting doors for our IP and the DAO in general. The current details of the offer are as follows…\n- The DAO treasury would sell 190 cats to this member at a price of .16 ETH per cat for a total of 30.4 ETH. \n- The DAO purchased those cats in our buyback program at an average cost of .15 ETH. \n- This would net a total profit of 3.4 ETH including the royalties made on the initial purchases. \n- The DAO would use the proceeds of the sale to continue to fund the buyback program providing more liquidity to floor and generate more royalties for the treasury. \n- The DAO would gain a beneficial whale/investor relationship that could be leveraged for future connections, partnerships and potential collaborations.

These are both related to other approved snapshots, but we thought it was prudent to be very clear about the near term budget requirement and make sure that it was supported by a DAO vote. Today we are proposing small budgets for short term legal and development costs as followed.\n\n1. Legal Costs - As we mentioned several times we are in need of expanding our legal team to help us navigate both some basic and complicated legal issues. Basic stuff like our IP terms and artist work for hire agreements, and more complicated stuff like setting up a Swiss Association. We would like to request a operational budget of $15k to cover ongoing legal expenses and retainers. All legal expense payments will be publicly posted and clearly labeled. \n\n2. Development Costs - We currently have several hot plate projects that will require development support. We have tapped Nifty Labs, our current development parters to help us with some of these projects. These tasks include setting up a custom token gated comic book viewer for release of our first comic, doing the art generation, metadata refresh, and contract update for our new art, and managing the chain based raffle logistics. These tasks would be considered out of scope of our current maintenance agreement with them. We would like to request a $20k to cover these immediate expenses. Half would be paid as a deposit and half would be paid on completion.",

We want to ask our community what level is preferred so we can have a uniform royalty fee across OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2 & Coinbase.  In general, lower % encourages short-term traders/bots, while higher % rewards long-term holders as more fees go into the DAO.

To that end we need to decide if we want to extend the registration period of the raffle to let more people learn about it or to postpone the raffle until we have regained access to our Twitter account. To make this process as fair a possible we will put up a snapshot vote and we can vote on how to best proceed. The options will be…\n\n1. Stick with the original plan of a 2 week registration period.\n2. Extend the registration by 2 weeks for a total of 4 weeks. \n3. Postpone the raffle registration for up to 4 weeks while we try to regain access to our Twitter account. (Not guaranteed)\n\nOnce registration is closed the team will need aprox. 1 week to prepare for the final raffle. \n",

      "title": "Should the DAO invest in 10KTF and how much?",
      "content": "Please read the full proposal and all the options before vote!!!\nS/O to @RE#2360 for the huge research and help he did for the DAO.\nAlso, remember we will host an AMA on Thursday, for more info please check the announcement on discord. If you have any question and want to solve it before vote, please wait for the AMA.\n\nProposal: Allocate some funds towards 10KTF using the PFPs we have in our vault to:\n\na. Create value by crafting our own items.\nb. Facilitate engagement with other communities by participating in battles.\nc. Establish a good relationship with 10KTF and its partners Gucci, Puma, beeple and Wenew Labs.\nd. Possibly get our new art approved as one of the parent collections.\n\nOption 1: Testing the water (let‘s just see how this works)\n\nAllocate 5 ETH to craft the necessary Level 1 items for our MAYC 370 as a test run. Find one trusted board member to carry out the missions as best as possible (some missions might be surprise missions). The Mutant was chosen because he crafts the rarest Hoodie (epic s. above) and a full set gives additional benefits. We can use the Mutant to craft the items onto the blank items and wouldn‘t have to spend extra money.\n\nAny rewards (materials, ApeCoin, items) either go to the Vault or can be used within the system to craft more items with other Apes.\n\nOption 2: *Let‘s do this (maximising hit points for game)*\n\nAllocate 10 ETH to craft Level 1 and Level 2 items for two different PFPs with the rarest traits to maximise impact in the upcoming battles. One person could still carry out the battles alone. Potential personal profit for certain activity in the community would stay with that person. Distinction is necessary because OG status (through meaningful participation)  has been rewarded in the past (Mint passes, Combat crates, Ape-coin).\n\nOption 3: *Have an impact on 10KTF (focusing on bringing many Mutant Cats holders and attention)*\n\nAllocate 20 ETH and recruit and army of Mutant Cats. Only genesis items are bought as they are rumoured to hold the most amount of value in the future. Different people (as many as possible)  engage at 10KTF (with a special name tag to symbolise and represent the Mutant Cats. Example: Re from MutantCats 10KTF eSport team). Rewards from the battles go to the Vault, while personal benefits through discord engagement (posters, VIP parties) go to the person involved (to incentivise a strong presence in the Discord).\n\nBenefits:\nProfit directly from assets in our vault.\nCreate a presence with our community by actively engaging in other communities (in this case with the added benefit of getting the rewards).\nMaking use of our Vault by using the PFPs to craft digital items.\nPossibly creating MC holder value by being able to leverage our engagement into craftable MutantCats. Mutant Cats Flamethrower would be kind of awesome.\n\nConnect ourselves to brands in the Metaverse early on, since Gucci and Puma have been collaborating with 10 KTF (materials drop, private shopping tours, first buying rights for holders of 10KTF Gucci Grail that was dropped to some members). Founder M FIgge has collaborated with Louis Vuitton in the past.",

The acquired MCs will be stored in the Gnosis vault and will be non-voting for snapshot purposes.  In the medium-term, we intend to use those MCs as part of our marketing strategy, including but not limited to promotional giveaways, collab partnerships, influnecers, raffles and equity deals.\n\nTDLR\n- Authorize the board to use up to 100 ETH to buy Mutant Cats from floor at random times and only at low prices.\n- Cats will be stored in the Gnosis Wallet and they will not have voting rights. \n- Mid-Term they will be used for all kind of promos, collabs, giveaways, equity deals, etc etc etc.",

Multisig is an essential component to keeping our DAO and assets safe and secure, so it is our goal to try and work around these obstacles to the best of our ability. To that end, we have a busy few months ahead of us and the board would like to propose adding an additional emergency signer to the Multisig team to ensure that we always have the quorum needed to compete transactions in a timely manner. \n\nThe board would like to nominate @Goaty#6355 to this emergency multi-signer position. Goaty is currently our largest token holder (+250 Cats) and has been a devote supporter of this project since its early days. Given the substantial investment she has made into the project we feel that she would be an ideal candidate to help safeguard our transactional processes. \n\nThis snapshot will ends at the same time as our \"rebalance our APE Ecosystem proposal\" so we can proceed as fast as possible with the transactions.",

      "title": "Should the DAO proceed with the Vault Rescue?",
      "content": "Should the DAO proceed with the plan proposed Below to eliminate FISH token from the MutantCats DAO and rescue the NFTs in our Vault?\n\nThis snapshot is to decide if the Mutant Cats DAO and its BusyGroup Teams should move forward with the plan to eliminate the current fractionalized FISH token from its ecosystem. For more context on this Snapshot and the process being proposed please see our recent announcement here. https://discord.com/channels/894337851762802718/894716961391517696/941529944691986512 \n\nMain reasons we are considering this action:\n1. The legal ambiguities surrounding the Fractionalized FISH token\n2. No sustainable utility for the FISH token\n3. No liquidity makes it difficult to trade the token\n4. We can not leverage or take advantage of any of the NFTs we have locked in the Vault\n\nVoting yes on this snapshot is approving the following steps:\n\n1. Reverse the previous Snapshot to distribute FISH upon a vault buyout. This is because we are buying the Vault from ourselves.\n2. Pause current staking contract FISH emissions and transfer all remaining FISH in that contract to the DAO controlled Mulstisig wallet\n3. Use DAO assets to initiate bid on Fractional.art to start vault buyout process. The DAO may need to liquidate some lower value NFTs and/or take a short term loan to ensure a safe and secure buyout process.  (All funds and assets will be returned to the DAO once the buyout is complete)\n4.  Upon successful buyout, all NFTs in the Vault will be transferred immediately to the DAO Gnosis wallet. All DAO owned FISH will be traded back to Fractional for Eth and returned to the DAO wallet. Any remaining FISH in the world could be exchanged to Fractional.art at this time for its real world buyout value. \n5. Once all NFT’s and Funds have been secured the BusyGroups will proceed with organizing the raffles. The total value of the raffled NFTs will not exceed 50 eth, some will come from the vault and others will be purchased. Raffle entry tiers will be distributed fairly based on how much FISH you hold. \n6. Governance and Value still remains with your MutantCats NFT token.\n\nThis proposal additionally reaffirms our commitment to long term value accumulation by continuing to curate a proven, outperforming portfolio of blue chip NFTs and bringing more value to our token holders. \n",

Through a critical self-evaluation of this process, we have determined where we have been successful and where we can improve. Most importantly, we see the need to expand our organization, while also reducing overall cost. With this updated operating structure we have reduced our 22 eth monthly compensation budget to just around 13 eth. This will expand the reach of our organization to over 27 people and include compensation for both multisig and the moderator team.\n\nYou can see the full text of the new Board and BusyGroup Proposal here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gth4xmpYZ7W8P3GfJE6K1tBxpqdguDkJBuL7mFHDTXs/edit?usp=sharing\n\nPlease support the DAO by taking moment to vote on this new structure that we can continue to move forward with improving the DAO and increasing value in this project for all Mutant NFT holders. \n",

It also allows us to plan and budget for events without having to rely on devs or the primary multisigs in order to make small and quick transactions on behalf of the community. \n\nBUDGET FOR APPROVAL\nWithdraw 10 ETH from the Mutant Cat DAO Treasury to fund the Community Wallet. \n\nSUMMARY\nCreate and fund a Community Wallet with 10ETH to use it in Community Managment activities, giveaways, contest, tournaments, collabs, etc.\n\nThe wallet will be operated by a team of Moderators and Marketing members.

To smoothly pass control and the future direction of the MutantCats community from the project’s developers to an owner-operated Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), we propose a framework that will permit the community to work together on several projects simultaneously, all within a clear governance structure.\n\nThe MutantCats Operations BusyGroup is in the process of building a documented governance structure for the DAO. Elected Senior Cats are writing that structure and we will request approval from the community to put these rules and regulations into effect.\n \nOur first Governance Proposal is the basis for all DAO governance going forward. This proposal outlines the defined roles in the DAO and the process for community members to propose projects and amend governance.\n \nA DAO is dependent on the participation of the community. MutantCats ownership gives you the power to be involved in building a successful DAO. So please review this proposal and vote as soon as possible.\n\nThis proposal is approved if the vote runs for exactly 72-hours (3-days) and is favored by at least 75% of the votes.\n\nPlease read  MUTANTCATS DAO GOVERNANCE PROPOSAL NO. 1.1\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1ntyG3kJSkY6FLHv-usvVcgQxd3sd_PbI/view?usp=sharing",

They invested heavily into the metaverse and continue to build out Gutter City on a 3x3 plot in the sandbox. They are also working on the GCG DAO which has the potential to add lots of value to the whole project. The project also only has a low number of 3K Cat NFT's. They have a golf tournament coming up December 3rd that's sponsored by Coinbase NFT and with Miami Art Week starting this will be the perfect time to make this move and gain exposure for Mutant Cats. \nEven if you don't believe in GCG 100% the marketing alone from this move would be worth it.\n\nBenefits: \n- With Miami Art Week going on a move like this will give us great marketing and exposure. \n- Give Mutant Cats exposure to a potential massively undervalued project that could offer great value to our DAO\n- Be involved with one of the best NFT brands in the space.\n\nPlease see the images attached to this proposal using the following link:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/894337851762802718/899866164337983520/915328670678257674\n\nSummary:\n- Buy 10 cats from GCG to gain more exposure for our Mutants.\nFloor at the moment I'm writting this proposal is 4ETH, wich means we will need 40 ETH + to do this purchase.\n",

      "title": "Should we distribute the DAO-owned $FISH tokens proportionally to existing $FISH holders in case of a buyback? ",
      "content": "The objective of this proposal is to define how DAO-owned $FISH tokens are managed in the case of a vault buyout.\n\n(This proposal is submitted and supported by the DAO Tokenomics Busygroup).\n\nDescription:\n$FISH token represents fractionalized ownership of DAO assets. However, >50% of $FISH is held by the DAO itself, making it nebulous as to the actual backed amount per $FISH token. If the DAO vault was bought out... \nWould the DAO itself receive a fraction of the ETH? Would cats? \n\nThis proposal sets out a clarification that $FISH token holders will receive 100% of the proceeds of a vault buyout, and the DAO will keep 0%, thereby allowing the backing per $FISH token in circulation (meaning not owned by the DAO) to define the worth of $FISH rather than the fraction of the total number of $FISH coins. As we can't  feasibly change the vault contract in the near term, the following policy shall be adopted by the DAO:\nOnce our vault is bought out, a snapshot will be taken of $FISH holders within 24 hours of the buyout completing. \nThe $FISH in the DAO's possession at that time will be distributed to the non-DAO $FISH holders in proportion to their percent of circulating $FISH owned. \nA small portion will be withheld to cover the gas cost for a slow (but low gas) transfer of DAO $FISH to other $FISH holders at the time of the snapshot. With 99%+ of the $FISH supply distributed to $FISH holders with this method, $FISH holders can now claim their proportion of vault ETH value. \nThe DAO may then claim its remaining small share of $FISH-eth rewards to offset the gas cost of this distribution.\n\nBenefits:\n•    Clarifies that 100% of the vault value is held by $FISH holders (Excluding the MutantCats DAO) at any given time.\n•    A direct parallel to fixed-fraction vaults where the tokens represent a constant fraction of the vault, empowering $FISH holders and encouraging HODLing (If you value our vault you value your $FISH more now).\n•    Should help to stabilize the $FISH price at a more predictable floor value that would currently (with ~1436233 FISH in circulation and at current vault valuation of 892.24 ETH based on research by the Treasury BusyGroup) be ~0.0006212 ETH/FISH or roughly $2.57/FISH (with utility and voting value added on top of that).\n\nSummary of Proposed System: \nIn the case of a vault buyout, a snapshot will be taken and the $FISH owned by the DAO will be distributed proportionally among $FISH holders to allow $FISH holders to cash out near-100% of the vault value for themselves. Incidentally, this makes each FISH backed by ~$2.57 of vault NFTs at the time of this proposal.",

(drops, mints, games, community)\n* Access to The Citadell through an election process in the community.\n(A small multisig of 3 people will be voted individually)\n\nWHEN?\n* [23/11/2021] Now , this week we purchase before [28/11/2021] and elect as soon as the snapshots are finalized with the quorum needed.\n\nFull Proposal in Notion:\nhttps://www.notion.so/mutants/NEO-TOKYO-PURCHASE-0232454f28db4f9c8adfcca2adf9e342\n[Important to look for the election process of the representatives and new multisig wallet!]\n\nWhat is Neo Tokyo? \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMSma83h1LY\n\nMasterminded by @zssbecker and @elliotrades a free NFT collection you could mint by solving riddles. The community was tightly formed through these games. If you couldn’t mint you had to buy in. Their goal is to shake out paperhands and create a community of diamond handed people ready to be first movers in crypto and NFT investing, building and supporting the crypto gaming and metaverse community. The creators refer to NT as the illuminati of crypto gaming. The community is building its own structure at the moment, forming alpha funnel processes, newsletters, creating web apps, merch, you name it. Not much is known about how everything will work after “upload”, the ominous date where all the 4 NFTs will combine to create one genesis citizen, but there will probably be a staking mechanism that will be linked to citadel investments, like an index fund and launchpad and various metaverse applications which NT citizens will get first dibs on. (For now we know there was a large land purchase for the citizens forming one of the largest guilds in bigtime.gg but we assume involvement with Superfarm through Ellio and it has been hinted that “many face melting co-ops” with known metaverses are in the pipeline coming in the next weeks. General thought is to create passive yield from owning large parts of the metaverse as a community, through investment and involvement and diamond handing early projects deemed worthy by the community.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**Option 1 - Medium Tier Set**\nA mid tier set will prioritize medium rare items keeping the cost minimal but still achieving at least medium yield, thinking a floor ID with low yield will not achieve our passive yield goals we didn’t include a totally floor option. Adding a floor item cache and floor land since those presumably don’t contribute to passive yield (could change). This set also does not contain withdrawable $bytes tokens.\n- Total Cost at this time: 41,15 ETH\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Option 2 - Balanced Tier Set**\nA balanced set is high yield on character and vault, otherwise floor items and land, disregarding elite ranking and unopened vault / $bytes tokens.\n- Total Cost at this time: 90,18 ETH\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Option 3 - High Tier Set**\nA high tier set will maximize yield, be of average rarity < 500 and preferably get an unopened vault for the bytes tokens. (It is said they are needed for upload, there have been hints at a burn mechanism)\n- Total Cost at this time: 107,25 ETH\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Option 4 - Abstain**\nWe decide not to buy neo tokyo and wait for upload day to commence and then propose anew.\n\n",

This is a living list(scripted to update itself), and projects can be added or deleted with a vote. This proposals intention is to make the projects listed the ones the DAO has a clear pool to select every week, making it easier to determine what is a good project and what is a bad one for the DAO to adquire.\n\nThe next step if this list is approved, is creating a story behind every purchase during the week and giving time for marketing to build up a lore and expectation for the impeding purchase of the week. Treasury will work together with them and they will create a narrative and have enough time to execute a plan that will drive the most value for MC.\n\nAs an example, right now we are looking deeply at Neo Tokyo, and a draft is already on the making. As Neo Tokyo would already be on our list of projects we can purchase, if the DAO decides it is a good purchase, we will engage Marketing to make a story behind it. Once this story is made we will make the purchase at the best timing possible as Marketing expertise dictates, making a coordinate effort in getting the most value from it.\n\nThe current list is as follows:\n\nAnonymice\nBears Deluxe\nBored Ape Yacht Club\nCool Cats\nCyberkongz Genesis\nCyberKongz Baby\nCyberKongz VX\nCryptoadz by Gremplin\nCryptoPunks\nDamien Hirst - The Currency\nDeafbeef\nDogepound\nDoodles\nFidenza\nGutter Cat Gang\nKaiju Kingz\nMutant Ape Yacht Club\nNeo Tokyo Identities (Combined)\nRingers by Dmitri Cherniak\nSupducks\nWorld of Women\nXCOPY",

      "title": "DAO Marketing BusyGroup Fish Bounty Proposal",
      "content": "Full Proposal: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1vz4-UVDwBYNm5MHhHZutE_0UF6RTqVxQhgaLa0Y1MMc/edit\n\nUnder the current DAO organization proposal only a small handful of organizers are being compensated by the DAO. For most groups this system works fine as their roles are currently limited to a small number of participants. For Marketing Group this poses a problem as we already have a network of over 30 cat owners actively looking to participate in our creative journey. Bounties will be created at reasonable market rates for the tasks requested. Bounty payments will be held for intervals before release to prevent people sniping tasks to dump fish on our market. The goal here is to reward our most engaged and committed contributors directly for the work they are contributing in an accountable and transparent fashion. \n\nHere is a few examples of the types of tasks that will be listed on the Bounty Board with a theoretical range of their respective bounties:\n-Update existing graphic (25-100 Fish)\n-Create new graphic (50-200 Fish) \n-Video Editing (100- 500 Fish) \n-Newsletter Articles (50-200 Fish) \n\nBENEFITS\nBy having a fund for $FISH bounties this allows Marketing Group to compensate contributors at reasonable market rates for micro tasks that are being completed. For example if we need a graphic updated or a video edited, instead of waiting for a volunteer or paying a 3rd party, we could post a bounty with a value that appropriately prioritizes the task. This incentivizes our contributors to stay engaged and always be ready to work for the DAO! \n\nBUDGET FOR APPROVAL\nWithdraw 20k Fish from the Community Rewards Fund for use towards Marketing Group bounties. All bounties disbursed must be approved by at least 2 senior cats. No additional impact to the Treasury. \n\nTeam: Marketing Busy Group\nDeliverables: Working Bounty Board for Marketing Group\nTimeline: ASAP (less than 1 week)  \n\n\nFund MK Group Bounty Board with 20k FISH\nDo not fund MK Group Bounty Board \n",

I propose we buy a 6x6 land in this metaverse, where we will be able to gather, stake $SAND, play games, have a market, throw parties and increase fish utility inside of the game.\n\nBuying this Land will require future expenses that haven’t been calculated for the construction of the different games and structures in the Sandbox Land. While we will be seeking a partnership with The Sandbox and we have already contacted the COO/Co Founder Sébastien Borget, we have to take note that private sales are not gonna be available till Q1 2022. Till that moment MC will also have to approve a budget to pay artists to make the Sandbox land we choose a home for everyone of us.\n\nFull proposal:\nhttps://www.notion.so/mutants/Purchase-proposal-Sandbox-Land-fb98c33d9b04443dbda18c682888d38b\n\nBudget: 50(4,3% treasure) - 80 ETH(6.98% treasure) for purchasing a premium 6x6 land in The Sandbox.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBudget approval for BAYC\nWe could also instead buy 2 Floor BAYC. Every day more celebrities join the fray and their community grows and grows. One of the best in the space and we could certainly see them flipping CryptoPunks one day. With their token being introduced in 2022, possible Q1 its a good investment.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BoredApeYC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\n\nJust look at their twitter! Currently if not the best community in the space, one of the ones that are in the top3 no doubt.\n\nBudget: 2 BAYC 80 ETH (6.98% treasure)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBudget approval for CoolCats\nNo presentation is needed. BlueChip that could reach BAYC level in the future. ROI looks great and they are at a discount. $Milk has been announced, but in that regard they are taking their time.\nWe can add more CoolCats to the family! The $Milk farm in the future may add a lot of revenue for the DAO so it’s an interesting proposal to look at.\n\nBudget: 10 CoolCats 70-75 ETH (6% to 6.4% treasure)\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBudget approval for CryptoPunk\nThe originals. Celebrities, influencers, big names of the space rock up these NFT's. Could they reach 1000ETH in the future? Probably. Putting these pieces on the Vault can e an extremelly profitable long term play and a good PR stunt for twitter. We must say right now in the NFT Bear Market Crypto Punks floor has taken a hit. This is a good change to get one a good price.\n\nBudget: 1 CryptoPunk 80-90 ETH (7% to 7.4% treasure)",

      "title": "Should we rescue Metabears by buying out their DAO Vault?",
      "content": "\nMetabears are in trouble! They do not have enough liquidity in their treasury to regain control of their own vault. Should we help?\n\nCONTEXT & DESCRIPTION\nMetabear DAO does not have enough liquidity in their treasury to buy themselves out of their own vault and reboot their project. They currently hold less than 20 ETH in their treasury and would risk a malicious actor outbidding them during the buyout process. Due to our healthy treasury we are in a unique position to help them out of this situation and help spread comradery throughout the NFT space. \n\nTo help them we would buy out their DAO vault at a discounted price of (100ETH). In order to secure this transaction and to avoid risk to the MC DAO we would first be transferred over 99% of the total $Berry supply, their native fractionalized token. Once the Vault is purchased and the contents are returned to Metabears we could then exchange the Berries to claim back the ETH from Fractionlized.art. Due to the way Fractional.art’s buyout process is designed to work, there would be little to no risk to MC DAO funds.  \n\nBENEFITS\nMetabears has agreed to compensate the DAO (7.5 ETH) to secure our cooperation in this matter. This would be a first of its kind event, no one has done this before. On top of the compensation it could also be an excellent PR move. We would be the first DAO to ever buyout another DAO. This would cement us as major players in the NFT space. Lastly, it would simply foster a positive spirit of comradery in the NFT space. \n\nBUDGET FOR APPROVAL\nThe DAO would need permission to temporarily use (100 ETH) for the buyout process. The ETH would be returned once the transaction is completed. The DAO would then be compensated an additional (7.5 ETH) Total would be a net positive of (7.5 ETH) for the DAO minus gas fees. \n\nLINKS\nMetabears DAO vault: https://fractional.art/vaults/metabears-dao",

      "content": "There have been many DAO proposals at the same time, some of which are conflicting one another. This vote hopes to provide clarity and allow an informed decision about DAO funds controlled by the community.\n\nThe DAO currently holds ETH liquid worth 4-5 million USD. This can be used to make strategic blue chip NFT buys when the timing is right, as well as investing in community-led initiatives and even funding public goods.\n\nThe community has successfully passed proposals that the DAO should make a purchase at most once a week. In the long-term interests of the project, the DAO should also not spend more than 20% of its treasury at once.\n\nAt the same time, proposals have also passed to purchase 2 CryptoPunks, 10 Bored Ape Yacht Club, an amount of Sandbox land, and a Cool Cat that must go with every purchase. If they were all purchased at once, it could cost almost 50% of the DAO's funds, over 2 million USD. These proposals conflict with the budgeting proposals.\n\nWhat should the DAO do? As Mutant Cat owners, please vote your opinion:\n\n1. Resume voting and buying weekly, following the budget proposals with the long-term growth of the project in mind.\n\n2. Ignore the budget proposals and spend 50% of the DAO funds at once.",

There has to be a new and stronger ANTI-TOXICITY policy immediately implemented, so members that are CONSISTENTLY overly AGRESSIVE, DISRESPECTFUL, and OFFENSIVE with other members, besides spreading FUD, FALSE AND DEFAMATORY ACCUSATIONS, get BANNED, FOR LIFE. The policy/monitoring must be quick/active/effective enough that even if he/she re-enters under another name, that type of behavior still won’t be tolerated and will once again be BANNED. Diversity of ideas and great debate must be encouraged, but toxic behavior must be immediately punished, and until we get this solved we’re gonna keep moving too slowly and stressfully because of a very few rotten apples who simply can’t respectfully participate in a civilized democratic environment and whose main goal is to DESTROY the debate and create HATRED and HOSTILITY. Zeux was only the first to leave to preserve his mental health if we don’t do something about that TODAY. Other projects are way more advanced than us regarding bullying/toxic behavior, and it’s crucial that we advance as well. TOXICITY MUST NOT BE TOLERATED anymore if we want to be successful.",

      "title": "Snapshot: Creation of DAO Governance bodies and project groups",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal is to request funding for the creation of the workgroups that will be setting up our DAO governance and project groups (called BusyGroups). These groups will focus on value creation for the entire community and will actively work to develop a number of areas that will be needed to support future growth. \n\nWhy is this needed?\n\nAfter two weeks of intensive talks within the community, it was the consensus of our most active members that change was needed. To allow the community to gain control of the DAO, and future direction of the project, we propose a structure that will permit the community to work together on several projects simultaneously, all within a clear structure and approvals set by the DAO.\n\nWhat is our ask?\nWe ask the DAO to hire the following cats as SeniorCats for the first 4 weeks so they can devote time to set up the structures outlined in the documents referenced below:\n\nCommunications:   Zeuxeux#1148 \nOperations:  Vilius#3718 & AI Hate#3282 (authors of this proposal, 2 SCs for the first 4 weeks)\nMarketing: KryptoKing#9654 \nTokenomics: Vyryn#4618\nPurchases:  LowKey_DimLight#4431\nIT:  kathodler#1665\nTreasury:  Schulzy #0095\nSandbox:  Closed until the land is purchased\n\nWe ask the DAO to hire one additional BusyCat per BusyGroup, chosen by the respective SeniorCat for the first 4 weeks.\n\nWe ask the DAO to compensate each SeniorCat with a 0.2ETH weekly payout plus 0.9ETH extra payment at the end of the four weeks if they were successful. We ask DAO to compensate each BusyCat with a 0.2ETH weekly payout and 0.4ETH extra payment at the end of the four weeks if they were successful. To ensure accountability, extra payment can be withheld if the majority of the CatBoard feels the SeniorCat or BusyCat failed in their duties.\n\nThe maximum expense for the DAO:  22.7ETH\n\nWhat do we commit to?\n\nTo create a fully functional Wiki for the BusyGroups on Notion.\nTo bring together cats ready to work.\nTo create the foundations and infrastructure of the BusyGroup to give value to the DAO.\n\n\n\n\nWe highly recommend you go through these pages to have a full and deep understanding of what we are trying to achieve.\n\nDAO structure:\nhttps://www.notion.so/mutants/DAO-Structure-b8c88def2a8348f29ed1d8c34c88765f\nBusyFlow:\nhttps://www.notion.so/mutants/BusyFlow-4bcaf00225ee437c91409661a590b81c\nCompensation:\nhttps://www.notion.so/mutants/Compensation-3465045b6c31458981781738d25cc7f4\n\nIMPORTANT: This proposal does not prevent anyone from forming task forces within the BusyGroups, creating proposals for any continuous or task-related jobs, and being approved by the CatBoard and community. All this can start right after this proposal is approved. Anyone who wants to bring value to this community will be able to do it and be compensated for it - there is no limit!\n",

      "content": "\nThis proposal attempts to do this by suggesting we set aside some funds to act as grant money for a HACKATHON. The HACKATHON will be a call to arms for all developers/artists/creators that are part of this community to pool together all their resources and build out complementary $FISH utility as it benefits all mutant holders. \n\nWhy should we do this? This project lives and dies on fish utility. I believe we have lots of DEV smarts nascent in the community and we should take advantage of that! Goal should be to create as much creative utility for $FISH and $SERUM as possible this will drive our valuation on top of our community. Also a hackathon will provide a marketing opportunity to promote the mutantverse in the general blockchain and ethereum communities. \n\nProject criterion:\na) Provider value to Mutant Holders\nb) Must send $FISH to the FISH treasury\nc) Must be open source\n\n(more to be announced)\n\nProcess:\n1) Create Hackathon channel in discord for discussion.\n2) Determine budget (second snapshot vote).\n3) Coordinate with the dev team for potential colab.\n6) Agree on rules.\n7) Release dates and timeline.\n8) Accept registrations.\n9) Hold event.\n\nBudget ideas. 10ETH+ ($50K) is a reasonable first prize for an ethereum hackathon. I believe any project that provides utility for FISH should be rewarded with something however so I would suggest we allocate budget for runner up prizes those as well as a marketing budget.\n\nQUESTION: \n\nShould we hold a hackathon? If so how much budget should we put aside for it? Remember we need to support a marketing effort as well as prize money.",

      "title": "Should the DAO implement the following scheduling/structural/purchase changes?",
      "content": "- DAO members should submit proposals in the proper format as demonstrated in #proposal format Monday-Friday including pricing of their proposal. \n- Friday at 1PM EST will be when all proposals meeting engagement requirements (75 yes reactions) are voted on in one large Snapshot with all details, pricing and credit written up via a Medium article. \n- All other proposals will be wiped from the proposal channel at that time and will have to be resubmitted on the following Monday if their author so chooses. \nThese snapshot votes will run 24 hrs, ending at 1PM EST on Saturdays. As agreed upon previously in a budget Snapshot, we must have one day for purchases. I propose that this be Saturday 1PM EST after the purchase options have been voted on, as that is a day when more people are generally active. \nSunday will be our weekly AMA at 1PM EST to recap our events of the week including our purchase/purchases of that week. \nThis leads straight to Monday’s release of the Weekly Newsletter which includes information of the week’s events, purchases, AMA notes, and Alpha Mutant intel. Furthermore, to cap spending of DAO funds, as suggested by @Sativious, I would like to put forth a percentage of expenditure limit. We cannot at any time spend more than 20 percent of the current ETH balance in our DAO wallet. This is to always keep our funds at a reasonable level. Future proposals will have to be within the 20% limit if this proposal passes in a Snapshot. If we find ourselves with room for more than one purchase on Saturday, the next highest voted option from Friday’s 24hr vote will be added to Saturday’s purchase ONLY if the total falls within the 20% limits. If you disagree with ANY of the points made in this proposal, vote DISAPPROVE.",

      "content": "Summary:\n\nWhitelist Liquity USDT Stability Pool and CIA staking for MutantCats DAO deposits.\n\nBackground:\nCIA defined a framework for MutantCats where 33% of excess treasury reserves can be deposited to earn yield in whitelisted protocols. At the time of this writing, the whitelisted protocols are USDT, USDC, FISH, and Sushi. This proposal seeks to add Liquity to this whitelist while keeping the same 33% treasury deposit cap.\n\nDescription from cryptoinvestor.ca:\nCIA is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Matic used as collateral. Loans are paid out in USDT - a USDT pegged stablecoin, and needed to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%.\nIn addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing USDT and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort.\nCIA as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable and governance-free.\n\nSpecifics:\nThis proposal is only targeting the USDT stability pool and CIA staking on current liquidity reserves. USDT would be deposited in the stability pool to earn CIA. The earned CIA would be staked to earn more USDT and MUTANTCATS DAO. Liquidations in the platform use the stability pool’s USDT to ensure the protocol is healthy. In doing so, MutantCats DAO is provided and USDT is taken. This is considered acceptable as the treasury already accumulates ETH and ZEC deposits which replenish any USDT removed from our deposit.\n\nRisks:\nA vulnerability in the CIA protocol could lead to partial or complete loss of funds. Severe liquidations could leave us with substantially less USDT, but more CIA and Mutants.\n\nProtocol Analysis:\nUsing a risk analysis framework developed by the DAO, the Policy and Partnerships teams have attempted to score various protocols based on some subjective and non-subjective data. CIA-Liquity mining scored well in this regard. The subjective values were derived from averaging the votes of multiple DAO members.\n\nMotivation:\nWhitelisting Liquity will allow MutantCats to begin accumulating CIA which can then be staked for more USDT and ETH. This also increases our chances for further Liquity partnerships in the future. Lastly, our funds in the stability pool would help ensure the long term success of the Liquity protocol.\n\nCIA Polygon matic  \nERC20 Smart Contract 0xdb986Dc13E1023d02E7cb582Ef53034f8Fc8B378\nWebsite: http://www.cryptoinvestor.ca/\nWhere to deposit USDT to join the crowdsale.\nhttps://app.dodoex.io/cp/join/0xd68487cd1cf9f1e601bf374941d807e35d64828f?network=polygon\n\nLiquidity Mining rewards to be deposited to MutantCats Dao treasury on 1st of Nov.",

Our security specialists will be in contact with you during and after the smart contract audit. As a result, you will be able to check whether you have introduced the right fixes. Our smart contracts audit experts will also advise you in what direction you should strive to develop your security policy to avoid becoming vulnerable to both known and novel types of cyberattacks.\"\n\nSuggestions: \n- https://quantstamp.com/audits\n- https://hacken.io/services/blockchain-security/ethereum-smart-contract-audit/\n- https://kudelskisecurity.com/services/applied-security/blockchain-security/",

      "content": "Here's my full proposal that I would like everyone to consider.\n\nMutant Cats Roadmap and ETHOS =  \"buy 1 floor cool cat per week until there's no more supply left\"\n\nWe already have 2 rare cool cats. But the next step could be to buy 1 floor cat per day for 1 week to help set a precedence and build up our vault. OR we could just drop all 100 ETH on floors right now.\n\nThen after this initial buying, move to purchasing just 1 cool cat per week until the end of time.\n\nIt's super simple and similar to nouns DAO how they release 1 nouns NFT per day forever. \"Buying floor cool cats every week, forever\" is really hard to fuck up\n\n\n-----\n\nTHIS GIVES US:\n\n✅ A very clear value proposition and marketing message\n\n✅A way to effectively dollar cost average into coolcats, consistently over time\n\n✅Spreads out our funds so that devs don't have to keep fronting more ETH while waiting for opensea payouts every 30 days\n\n✅Makes it easier to succeed, especially long term. The least resistance we have to deciding on what to buy, and the more simple the message/what we're all about is = the more chance of actually going through with the plan.\n\n✅ It's a positive feedback loop. Creates regular buy pressure on coolcats floor and thus increases the price of cool cats,  mutant cats, and FISH\n\n----\nThe above is pretty proven strategy when it comes to FI/RE and buying index funds on a monthly basis. So surely we can make this work in NFTs as well.\n\nWe would want to save a % of funds as a \"Reserve\" for bear markets or times of low liquidity (eg: if on one month we don't receive many royalties on opensea). This will allow us to continue purchasing our coolcats on schedule. And buy some cheaper ones at better entry prices a long the way. \n\n----\n\nPlease cast your vote below. There are 4 options to choose from.\n",
