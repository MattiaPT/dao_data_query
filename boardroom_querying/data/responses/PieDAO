      "title": "DOUGH / eDOUGH buyback redesign ",
      "content": "## Summary\nThe following proposal builds on the feedback provided by the community after the execution of the [initial buyback program](https://snapshot.org/#/piedao.eth/proposal/0xb138fbf9e080ede1f59676422d8472ef807a42db53d8b5f6a26c2fab6a7a99ca). Redesigned buyback mechanisms, parameters and time windows are proposed and discussed below. \n\n## Authors\n@Gabo_o, @Bennet\n\n## Passing Thresholds\n5% or more of veDOUGH supply must participate (21,939,254 * 0.05 = 1,096,962)\n60% or more of participating tokens must vote FOR\n\n## Motivation\nTo start, the goal of the buyback program was mainly twofold. First, it was meant to offer liquidity providers a slippage-free exit for the Dough side of their LP positions given the termination of the [Doughpamine incentive program](https://snapshot.org/#/piedao.eth/proposal/0x625b318bf91343bb3904bafcaf0e32e2d44a8f6acd6cb9e436ae22464d349423). Second, it wanted to provide Dough holders who did not wish to upgrade to Auxo with a similar type of exit. The complementary goal of this offering was to avoid LPs and Dough holders from selling to the open market thus further depressing the price of Dough. Ultimately, all Dough bought back by the DAO will be burned along with the Dough already present in the [treasury](https://forum.piedao.org/t/treasury-dough-burning/1423/7). \n\n## What happened\nWhile the buyback program was intended to serve the purpose and participants mentioned above, it failed to fulfill such purpose given how a number of system mechanics and parameters were selected. Perhaps one of the main fallbacks came from the very issuance of funds methodology. Instead of topping up the buyback contract by streaming funds, which would have allowed multiple participants to participate in the program, funds were deposited in the contract in a single transaction thus allowing for a ‘first come first serve’ circumstance where a small number of small addresses took basically the entire deposit. Fortunately, as a risk mitigation effort, the team had only deposited a mere fraction of the entire buyback budget and therefore there is still plenty of balance for users that still wish to participate. \n\nAnother issue derived from the utilisation of the past 30 days average market price (TWAP) as the price set for the buyback. This time length was selected to avoid the buyback price from being too sensitive to sudden price movements. Nonetheless, as the market crashed - and Dough price accordingly - a few days before the start of the buyback, the market price of Dough turned out to be 30% to 40% lower than the buyback price right at the start of the program. The arbitrage opportunity obviously did not go unnoticed and increased the incentives for early buyback participants to participate in the buyback. As a matter of fact, even a trading bot took advantage of the arbitrage. \n\nWith all this being said, it becomes evident that the buyback program did not serve who it was intended to and that some of its aspects had to be redesigned. The following sections will outline such design improvements, a number of which were proposed by the DAO. \n\n## Scope\nIn light of the events that occurred and the purpose of the buyback initiative, the design changes that would be implemented are the following:\n\n1. Instead of depositing funds into the contract as done previously, funds will be streamed to the contract with a certain streaming rate. Streaming will be conducted utilising [llamapay](https://llamapay.io/). The latter being a function of the buyback budget for the specific epoch and the length of the epoch, aka 14 days. The implementation of the streaming should guarantee that the buyback won’t be participated only by a few addresses but by a larger number of users instead. As it was initially intended to be.\n\n1. The TWAP utilised for setting the buyback price will be reduced from 30 days to 3 days. This will also result in the buyback price being updated every three days. The main rationale behind this choice is to avoid substantial arbitrage opportunities as they occurred last time. As arb opportunities may still be present if the price of Dough swings considerably in short time frames, these should be mitigated both by the streaming of funds described above and by the price update happening every 3 days. Moreover, while on one side this may lead to higher buyback prices (less capacity for all outstanding Dough), on the other it could also mean lower buyback prices (higher capacity) shall the price of Dough fall further.  \n\nWhile the streaming of funds is an ideal solution for allowing a larger number of users to participate, it may not be as ideal for wallets holding larger amounts of Dough. For the latter, participating in the buyback could come at a risk of being very time-consuming and not having the guarantee of being able to sell their Dough to the contract. For this reason, the team has also decided to offer wallets holding more than 200,000 DOUGH a buy-back deal over the counter (OTC). In this respect, the OTC buyback price would be equal to the one offered by the buyback contract the moment the OTC transaction is taking place. Furthermore, the budget that would be utilised for OTC buybacks would be taken from the budget allocated to later epochs of the buyback, starting from the very last one. Please reach out directly in Discord DMs to @gabo_o or @bennet if you would like to perform an OTC transaction. In sum:\n\n1. For holders of > 200k Dough, an OTC deal will be granted at a price equal to the same buyback price offered by the contract the moment the transaction is taking place. **Participants who wish to opt for this deal can directly DM @Gabo_o or @bennet on the PieDAO discord server.**\n\n## Benefits & Risks\n\nBenefits:\n- Higher amount of users will be able to participate in the buyback\n- Reduced arbitrage opportunity risk\n- Tailored solution for larger holders\n\nRisks:\n- Potential higher buyback prices (less buyback capacity for budget)\n\n## Next Steps\nShall this proposal pass, the program will commence again on the 13th of December, 2022 and epochs will last two weeks as set in the program's previous iteration. Discounts have also been revisited and will follow the ones listed in the table below. Finally, the budget and pricing for the buyback of eDOUGH remains totally unchanged.\n\n## Dough\n\n![dough.png](ipfs://bafkreiaabxk54b4mfnjx2tuhrdshnqttwwnzndwh42w2dfzxavwemnzqau)\n    \n\n## eDough\n\n![edough.png](ipfs://bafkreigwxgspcwo2uas3izstekcintde73dioyu26ezcwegecuzv7hvqdm)\n\n    \n\n\n\n## Closing notes\nWe hope that the adjustments proposed will level the buyback playing field and allow a larger set of users to participate in the program. We would also like to take this chance to thank all DAO members that participated constructively in the proposition of new execution mechanisms.\n\nLet us know if you support it, or not, or even if more information or further discussion may be needed\n\n## FOR - Support the changes, and agree to proceed with them\n## AGAINST - Do not support them, and want to halt their implementation\n## MORE INFO - Need more information",

As the protocol will be migrating to a purely non-dilutive yield-generating operation, and considering all incentive programs have been officially faced off, DOUGH tokens currently sitting in the treasury cease to serve their initial purpose and, as a result, are eligible for burning.\n\n## Scope\nThe burning process is proposed to start around mid-December and will unfold over four different events. Each event will take place one month after the previous one and will burn 10% more tokens compared to the previous round. The burning timeline below displays both the burning period and magnitude. This process will anyhow terminate in sync with the planned migration to AUXO.\n\n![https://forum.piedao.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6e58a61999261b85bf4b45be4651e55f5c65c23c_2_690x391.png](https://forum.piedao.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/6/6e58a61999261b85bf4b45be4651e55f5c65c23c_2_690x391.png)\n\nTokens that will be burned are the ones held in the following addresses:\n\n- DAO Treasury: [0x4efd8cead66bb0fa64c8d53ebe65f31663199c6d](https://etherscan.io/token/0xad32A8e6220741182940c5aBF610bDE99E737b2D?a=0x4efd8cead66bb0fa64c8d53ebe65f31663199c6d)\n- Dough Buyback contract: [0xf3e82afa0ffa086a96147ce5f2d49f2989d02d13](https://etherscan.io/token/0xad32A8e6220741182940c5aBF610bDE99E737b2D?a=0xf3e82afa0ffa086a96147ce5f2d49f2989d02d13)\n- eDough buyback contract: [0x44EE9e89EFAE48bc4033437d7FE1807182Ec257A](https://etherscan.io/address/0x44EE9e89EFAE48bc4033437d7FE1807182Ec257A)\n- DAO Treasury multi-sig: [0x3bcf3db69897125aa61496fc8a8b55a5e3f245d5](https://etherscan.io/token/0xad32A8e6220741182940c5aBF610bDE99E737b2D?a=0x3bcf3db69897125aa61496fc8a8b55a5e3f245d5)\n- DAO Development multi-sig: [0xad32A8e6220741182940c5aBF610bDE99E737b2D](https://etherscan.io/token/0xad32A8e6220741182940c5aBF610bDE99E737b2D?a=0x6458a23b020f489651f2777bd849dded34dfccd2)\n\nFrom the addresses above, DOUGH will be collected in the DAO Treasury multi-sig ([0x3bcf3db69897125aa61496fc8a8b55a5e3f245d5](https://etherscan.io/token/0xad32A8e6220741182940c5aBF610bDE99E737b2D?a=0x3bcf3db69897125aa61496fc8a8b55a5e3f245d5)) and from there sent to the [0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD](https://etherscan.io/token/0xad32A8e6220741182940c5aBF610bDE99E737b2D?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD) address.\n\n## Benefits\nThe main benefits of this burning proposal will be:\n- (1) the reduction in supply\n- (2) the reduction in FDV (fully diluted valuation).\nIn particular, by reducing FDV, the DAO would also increase the MCAP/FDV ratio, which gives a sense of how much of the supply is circulating compared to the total supply. \n\n## Risks\nA “side-risk” of this would be a possible appreciation of DOUGH price over time.\n\n## Next steps\nShall the proposal pass, the treasury will:\n1.

      "title": "[Gate 1] Auxo Migration",
      "content": "> Important! This is a Gate 1 proposal, meaning that we intend to gauge the community’s sentiment over this idea. If the vote passes, and the idea is accepted, we will start the proposal refinement stage where the execution planning will be developed, staged, and formalized into a PIP vote.\n\n# Summary\n\nThe following proposal has been created in order to gauge community sentiment on the DAO’s future direction, below summarized in 3 key changes:\n\n- Discontinue Pies (indexes) and disregard them from the active product offering\n\n- Promote revenue-generating operations to the main product offering\n\n- Rebrand PieDAO to Auxo\n\nThroughout this proposal, we will be introducing a more efficient tokenomics model with upgraded governance capabilities, efficiency-driven upgrades to the DAO token-staking system with optional liquid staking, new DAO services (Bonding/Lending), and upgrades on the Governance and Treasury Management operations.\n\nThis proposal is a consolidation of the following posts, please familiarize with them and their comments for a deeper understanding:\n\n- [Time to say Good Pie](https://forum.piedao.org/t/time-to-say-good-pie/1415)\n- [The Rise of Auxo](https://forum.piedao.org/t/the-rise-of-auxo/1419)\n\n# Authors\n\nAlexintosh, Gabo_o\n\n# Passing Threshold\n\n- 5% or more of veDOUGH supply must participate (20,003,959.48 * 0.05 = 1,000,197.97)\n\n- 60% or more of participating tokens must vote FOR\n\n# Motivation & Scope\n## Motivation\n\nThe [Governance Mining initiative](https://forum.piedao.org/t/pip-60-dough-staking-governance-mining/954), the program that introduced farming with treasury assets and revenue distribution to active voters, has yielded good results in boosting governance participation to an average of +50% of token holders. After 12 months, several rough edges have been identified with this current version which prevents the system to scale.\n\nProbably the most important is that, as for now, the treasury principal increases exclusively through the compounding of 25% of the distributed rewards, we need mechanics to support treasury principal expansion and scalability in a way that is non-dilutive vs Treasury Net Asset Value. We need to provide optionality for those who value being liquid while creating greater value for stakers under locks.\n\nMoreover, improvements are required to make operations of treasury management sufficiently trustless, empowering token holders to be in control while allowing a degree of flexibility for operators to act without having to go through the governance process for every single action.\n\nThe changes proposed below are inspired by the idea to embrace what works and make it scale, making liquidity provision the main activity of the DAO and protocol development centered around that very need.\n\nThe re-branding to AUXO is here described as the celebration of this choice and to signal a net cut from previous operations.\n\n## Scope\n### About Auxo\n\nAuxoDAO is a network of dedicated community members running STAT for farming operations.\n\nAuxoDAO will issue an ERC20 token: AUXO. The AUXO token represents a share of the fund and has an intrinsic floor value grounded in its wholly owned treasury capital, which is carefully preserved & grown.\n\nAuxoDAO uses its protocol-owned treasury assets to farm multi-chain with the goal to provide liquidity and expand its principal while generating yield on behalf of its token holders. The Treasury returns the value it generates to holders, who actively participate in governance, through its core passive-income product: veAUXO.\n\nThe AUXO token has a strictly controlled policy of expansion based on the Net Asset Value of the treasury. The DAO optimizes protocol-owned liquidity where AUXO-denominated pairs are directly owned and managed by the DAO instead of relying on rented liquidity and incentives.\n\nThere will be no liquidity incentives in AUXO, therefore eliminating sell pressure for the token. The protocol implements policies to automatically buyback tokens from the market in conditions when they trade below NAV value.\n\nAuxoDAO will introduce $KARMA, a token rewarding holders’ and stakers’ loyalty which utility will be connected to the governance of the KARMA-owned treasury with additional features of engagement, promotion, and rewards within the ecosystem.\n\n> AuxoDAO is fundamentally different from PieDAO because veAUXO holders administer DAO-owned funds with the mandate of generating yield, compared to creating and managing tokenized funds that use yield strategies for others.\n\n### STAT Framework\nSTAT is a framework to deploy Sufficiently Trustless Active Treasuries, it allows communities to allocate capital and generate yield on multiple chains on behalf of its token holders without relying on a small set of signers to not collude.\n\nThe STAT is composed of several modules implementing mechanics that allow to expand, manage and redeem a productive treasury, handle reward distribution, and having capital-efficient access to capital via fixed-rate loans.\n\n**High-level list of modules**\n\nFor the sake of the length of this proposal we added a link to each point detailed description available in the Forum:\n\n- [Staking & Liquid Staking](https://forum.piedao.org/t/the-rise-of-auxo/1419#staking-liquid-staking-4)\n- [Rewards distribution](https://forum.piedao.org/t/the-rise-of-auxo/1419#staking-liquid-staking-4)\n- [Treasury](https://forum.piedao.org/t/the-rise-of-auxo/1419#staking-liquid-staking-4)\n- [Bonding](https://forum.piedao.org/t/the-rise-of-auxo/1419#staking-liquid-staking-4)\n- [Lending](https://forum.piedao.org/t/the-rise-of-auxo/1419#staking-liquid-staking-4)\n\n### The Role of Governance\n\nIn AuxoDAO governance is designed around the resilience of operation and keeps the system trustless and decentralized. veAUXO holders serve different roles including but not limited to:\n\n- **Notarization & Transparency:** Community voting is used as a subjective oracle to insure full transparency about how strategies are performing, together with information about how they’re set up, operated, and composed.\n\n- **Authorization and Access Control:** veAUXO holders control the authorization layer of the Treasury by whitelisting contract addresses and contract signatures. This system allows only authorized transactions are executed by Treasury operators.\n\n- **Election of Treasury Operators:** veAUXO holders can add and remove Treasury Operators at any time, decreasing operational risks and expanding governance capabilities.\n\n- **Election of xAUXO Representative:** veAUXO Holders can elect the representative which is going to vote on behalf of xAUXO holders.\n\n- **Issuing Liquidity Events:** veAUXO holders have veto power to authorize or block new liquidity events.\n\n### The Farming Operation\n\nThe farming operation will be focused on expanding liquidity provisioning to multiple chains in order to capitalize on the best opportunities evaluated through a detailed and coherent risk framework. This framework advocates providing guidance for a proper assessment of such opportunities and delivering transparency for AUXO holders.\n\n# Benefits & Risks\n\n## Benefits\n\n- Non-dilutive and scalable treasury expansion tokenomics\n- No rented liquidity and incentives\n- Enabled on-chain governance\n- Liquid staking option with delegation capabilities\n- Lending as a new service offering\n- Bonding as tool to efficiently expand treasury capital\n\n## Risks\n- Dormant veDough holders missing the migration window\n- Sell pressure on the Dough token until the migration date, from holders choosing not to migrate.\n- Delay in the migration due to contract-audit completion dependencies\n\n# Next Steps\nIf the voting result is in favor of the migration, the core contributors team will deliver the following items\n\n- Migration road map\n- New website\n- Deploy and Audit contracts\n- Definition of the migration mechanics\n- Define a new governance model\n- Define Treasury Operators’ and Governance Representatives’ election dynamics\n- Define Bonding and Lending mechanics\n\n# Closing notes\n\nAuxo is designed in continuity with the operations which had best served veDOUGH holders in the last year and build on that by creating ways to grow the available principal and expanding operations on different chains. Auxo takes all the expertise accumulated in building tokenized funds with underlying productivity to deliver a protocol that is tailored around the DAO needs for trustless treasury farming. The introduction of the lending component increases significantly the ability of the treasury to operate and provides a venue for users looking to earn yield in a set-and-forget way which is equivalent, if not better, than a vault offering.\n\nWe believe this is the right direction to take. Minding the PieDAO’s lessons learned we can build a reliable and self-sustainable model that has the potential to maximize our holder’s return. This should be our priority, and we believe the changes above will take us there.\n\nWe ask for your input to speak up and let us know whether you:\n- Support the migration (FOR)\n- Do not support the migration (AGAINST)\n- Need more information (Detail More)",

      "title": "Dough / eDough buyback program ",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal introduces a DOUGH / eDOUGH Buyback program as a response to the termination of the DOUGHpamine, to absorb the possible unwinding of LP positions / dumping by holders not looking to participate in the DAO governance. Furthermore, the buyback should also serve any DOUGH holder willing to opt-out from the recently proposed upgrade to AUXO.\n\n## Authors\nBennet, Gabo_o\n\n\n## Passing threshold\n5% or more of veDOUGH supply must participate (CURRENT_SUPPLY * 0.05 = RESULT)\n60% or more of participating tokens must vote FOR\n\n## Motivation\nOne of the main reasons why the Doughpamine program was terminated was to avoid further selling pressure induced by LPs dumping rewards. As LPs now look at potentially unwinding their positions, they could potentially cause the very selling pressure the team has been trying to avoid through the proposal.\n\nMoreover, as LPs exit and unwind, dumping would occur on an increasingly illiquid market which would exacerbate price decline. This would thus result in a lose-lose situation for LPs and the DAO as the former will incur both lower selling price and higher slippage, while the latter would have failed in its attempt to mitigate selling pressure.\n\nIn order to prevent the eventuality outlined above, it’s proposed to run a buyback program for LPs and for all floating Dough held by the market, to also represent an alternative for holders willing to opt-out from the [proposed migration to Auxo](https://forum.piedao.org/t/the-rise-of-auxo/1419). In this way, holders who wish to sell their Dough can do so through an OTC deal directly with the DAO treasury. This solution therefore aims at protecting Dough from the negative price impact that would be induced by heavy market selling. In addition, this would allow holders to sell while avoiding price slippage.\n\n\n## Scope\n\n### Dough buyback\nThere will be 9 buyback epochs, lasting 2 weeks each. Each epoch will have an increasing discount applied on the buyback price. The buyback price will be fixed at the 30-day TWAP calculated at the day preceding the start of each epoch, plus the discount relative to the specific epoch. Discounts per epoch and epoch calendar periods are summarised in the table below.\n\n![https://forum.piedao.org/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0871dd09feaec208ef561be94aa51ff72d2fb001.png](https://forum.piedao.org/uploads/default/original/2X/0/0871dd09feaec208ef561be94aa51ff72d2fb001.png)\n\n### eDough buyback\n\nThis part of the buyback program is intended for eDough farmed by LPs which may not be able to vest before the protocol migration to Auxo or anyhow provide an exit solution for LPs that may prefer a short-cut alternative to the vesting of their eDough reward. Buybacks will follow the very same epoch distribution as for liquid Dough. However, the buyback price will be fixed per epoch and not dependant on market price, considering that eDoughs have no market/price set until vesting. The table below displays buyback price per epoch.\n\n![https://forum.piedao.org/uploads/default/original/2X/4/44d44efba8c9b1f2b1ac5e6c18ce0e766f973eb8.png](https://forum.piedao.org/uploads/default/original/2X/4/44d44efba8c9b1f2b1ac5e6c18ce0e766f973eb8.png)\n\n## Benefits and risks\n\nBenefits:\n\n- allow Dough holders to sell their Dough with no price slippage\n- avoid price impact of selling\n- reduce Dough selling pressure\n\nRisks:\n\n- Reduce treasury farming principal (capped)\n\n## Next steps\n\nThe proposed budget to be allocated to this buyback initiative is intended to be deployed in the buybacks contracts on an epoch-by-epoch basis, with residual balance from the previous epoch rolled over, to constitute the new epoch’s budget together with any required amount top-ups.\n\n![https://forum.piedao.org/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3df7f061afe6e63bde822c57683a195389e9a740.png](https://forum.piedao.org/uploads/default/original/2X/3/3df7f061afe6e63bde822c57683a195389e9a740.png)\n\nHolders that wish to opt for the buyback program will be able to do so through the PieDAO website. The website’s UI will be available by the first epoch’s start date, currently scheduled for November 15th 2022.\n\n## Closing notes\n\nThis proposal aims at giving holders who wish to sell an option to do so without incurring in slippage and without impacting market price. This would aid the DAO in containing selling pressure and consequent price decrease. The buyback budget would be allocated on a epoch-by-epoch basis with any remaining balance rolled over to the following epoch, up to the max amounts summarized on the chart above.\n\n## This Vote\n\nFOR: Proceed with the buyback\nAGAINST: Do not proceed with the buyback\nMore Info Needed",

      "content": "# Full Discussion\n> https://forum.piedao.org/t/doughpamine-programme-termination/1409\n\n# Summary\n\nThe Doughpamine programme was launched on April 2021, and has been running for 18 months with a total distribution of 18.8 million $DOUGH to liquidity providers so far.\n\nThe rewards distribution had both positive and negative effects on the DAO: bootstrapped liquidity on one end, but potentially contributed driving the [$DOUGH](https://etherscan.io/token/0xad32A8e6220741182940c5aBF610bDE99E737b2D) token value down significantly by being a source of sell pressure in the market.\n> We propose to terminate the Doughpamine programme in order to stop the bleeding.\n\n# Authors\nPieDAO Core Contributors team and Treasury Committee members.\n\n# Passing Thresholds:\n- 5% or more of veDOUGH supply must participate (19.432.867,18 * 0.05 = 971.643,35)\n- 60% or more of participating tokens must vote FOR\n\n# Background & Motivation\nPieDAO currently incentivizes 4 liquidity pools (a.k.a. [Farms](https://piedaoorg.on.fleek.co/#/farms)). These liquidity pools have been distributing 18.8M $DOUGH rewards until **period 18** (block 15625918). Note that of the total incentives distributed only 20% were immediately liquid, while the remaining 80% would vest linearly over one year.\n| Pool | Dapp | Liquidity  | Incentives (last period) | Cost of liquidity |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| PLAY-DOUGH | Sushi | $129,273 | $9,268 | $0.86 |\n| DOUGH-WETH | Sushi | $104,316 | $6,620  | $0.76 |\n| DOUGH-ETH | Balancer | $31,546 | $1,324 | $0.5  |\n| BCP | Balancer | $358,988 | $2,648 | $0.09 |\n\n**Cost of Liquidity**\n\nAs visible from the table above, around 80% of the Doughpamine incentives are being distributed to pools that have very high costs of liquidity. At current market conditions, the $Play/$DOUGH pool is paying $0.86 for each dollar worth of liquidity in the pool. This figure has also reached $1.52 in the [past](https://forum.piedao.org/t/doughpamine-incentives-program/752/31), meaning rewards substantially outweighed actually provided liquidity, resulting in quite an inefficient incentive programme. \n\nCurrently, the weighted average cost of liquidity sits at around $0.7, of which 20% liquid and 80% escrowed and subject to linear vesting over a year. The fact that the DAO has been overpaying for liquidity provision has certainly been contributing to the $DOUGH sell pressure, possibly inducing a resulting poor price performance.\n\n**We can conclude that:**\n1. Renting liquidity is a costly operation for the DAO’s Treasury\n2. $DOUGH rewards are impacting $DOUGH’s market price and accelerating its downward trend.\n\n# Specification\n### Objectives\n- Stop distributing $DOUGH incentives to LPs in order to decrease the token dump trend, and decelerate the token depreciation.\n\n### Plan\n- Stop incentivizing pools immediately after the voting end.\n- Set Pool Reward rates to zero.\n- Make an announcement in Discord and Twitter in order to inform members and Liquidity Providers.\n\n### Schedule\nThe rewards distribution will be stopped effectively after the snapshot vote, considering it ends in favor of this proposal (+60% FOR).\n\n### Team and Roles\n**Core Contributors**\n- Communication and socialization\n- Devs to set reward rates to zero on the Pools\n\n# Benefits & Risks\n\n### Benefits\n1. Stop the continuous selling pressure that this programme brings.\n2. Stop renting liquidity and prepare for a Liquidity owned model.\n\n### Risks\n1. Provisioning on these pools would no longer be relevant for LPs, potentially making them halt their contribution to the pools impacting the available liquidity, or unwinding their positions.\n2. LPs to continue dropping their $DOUGH rewards as their vesting ends.\n\n**Mitigation actions**: the DAO is designing a $DOUGH buy-back program aimed at both reducing the liquid $DOUGH supply and contrasting the market selling of liquid $DOUGH in light of possible LP positions unwinding. Further details on the buy-back program will be announced on a dedicated forum post.\n\n# Closing notes\nIn this proposal, we are presenting both a problem and an immediate action that we see fit to take place in order to decrease the selling pressure of the $DOUGH token. We aim to stop the bleeding and to stop renting liquidity while we find a more sustainable model. Please find the options to issue your vote.\n\n> **FOR**: To stop incentivizing pools\n> **AGAINST**: To continue incentivizing pools\n> **Need more Information**\n",

After such date the current application frontend will be replaced with an informative landing page about the PieDAO project, NOT providing access to PieDAO's applications.\n\n## Passing Thresholds:\n5% or more of veDOUGH supply must participate (CURRENT_SUPPLY * 0.05 = RESULT) 60% or more of participating tokens must vote FOR\n\n## Scope\nA DAO governance vote will be required to define whether any sanctions screening measures (APIs) should be implemented in the current PieDAO's application frontend, to comply with the recent guidance provided by OFAC.\n\nShould this Gate 1 result in favor of the implementation of screening APIs, a detailed budget would be defined and presented as part of the Gate 2 vote, including the API service provision by Chanalysis + the API implementation. \n\n## Risks involved\nThe frontend application (the one you connect the wallet to) has been hosted via Dexlab Inc. Because of the recent events, Dexlab Inc will not be able to keep hosting the application further unless sanctions-screening measures are implemented immediately. It would only be possible to host a marketing landing page, complicating the overall UX for users willing to connect to PieDAO's applications.\n\nNOTE: PieDAO contracts are unaffected and all code of the PieDAO website is open source and could be easily self-hosted or have it run locally. \n\nBy not implementing any sanctions screening measures, PieDAO will have to fully rely on Community self-organized measures aimed at providing self-hosted frontends for all PieDAO applications.\n\n## Vote\n-> FOR: Yes, PieDAO should implement sanctions screening measures to keep providing the best UX to PieDAO applications.\n\n-> AGAINST: No, PieDAO should NOT implement any sanctions screening measures and just rely on self-hosted frontends to have users accessing its applications.\n\n-> Detail more: I need more details to take an informed decision",

Only a minor amendment is proposed, removing the original rule capping to 60% the max cumulative allocation of the 3 larger holdings, required to more effectively represent the current marketcap of the metaverse/gaming sector, dominated by far by few leading projects (Sandbox, Decentraland, ApeCoin & Axie).\n\n\n## Allocation\nBelow the the proposed allocation to be considered for PLAY rebalancing.\n \n\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreieafdg7rfcjzdq7lwmed2n2d633hlgipw5vd3s4ypwuj7cuhyhjyi)\n\n\n\nNOTE: the Axie Infinity allocation resulted severely cut down to 5% in order to respect the max 3% slippage constraint for its allocation. The remaining was re-iteratively distributed pro-rata to other uncapped assets.\n\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreigperxhsxxekiql4sw6ofi76w2acjhbbmi2nojzfbb4fj7dazr2wq)\n \n\n\n## Do you support the proposed methodology amendment and resulting allocation for the PLAY index?",

The APECoin will be the hard currency of Otherside.\nYuga promised to focus on interoperability and web3-native features, when the majority of other teams are building yet another MMORPG. This approach, together with the Yuga’s background as the leading company in the NFT space, make Otherside a very promising metaverse project and APECoin a nice addition to the PLAY pie”\n—Gleb\n\nThis vote passed with 88% in support and 12% requesting more information.\n\n### Authors \nThis post is authored by @Jamie_DeFi, on behalf of @Gleb. \n\n### Passing thresholds  \n\n1. 5% or more of veDOUGH supply must participate in the vote (CURRENT_SUPPLY*0.05=RESULT)\n2. At least 60% of participating tokens must vote FOR \n\n### Motivation and scope \n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to ratify that the DAO wants to add $APE to $PLAY.  The purpose of this proposal is not to decide on a % allocation for this decision. \n\nThe benefits of adding $APE to $PLAY are that $APE represents one of the largest “social tokens” linked with an NFT collection.  As the most dominant company in the industry, Yuga Labs’ token represents significant market share, and this ought to complement preexisting components of $PLAY. \n\n### Closing notes \n\nThis vote is as to whether or not APE ought to be added as one of the components of PLAY.  A vote FOR signals support of this proposal, and a vote AGAINST signals that this proposal is not supported.  \n“MORE DETAIL” is another option, for those who would prefer that the proposal be discussed in more depth.

While the main driving factor remains protocols’ market capitalization, this time an initial protocol categorization was implemented, followed by further considerations regarding asset liquidity and relative category weight.\n\nProtocols were categorized based on their functionality, namely: DEXes, lending, asset management, derivatives, CDP, Infrastructure, Bridges & NFT DEXes.\nAfter initial mapping into the aforementioned clusters, a first list of indexable tokens was drawn by selecting protocols counting for at least 20% of the market capitalization of their relative category, and/or 1% of the market capitalization of the entire DeFi ecosystem.\n\n## Selection Criteria \nShortlisted products were analysed based on a number of ad-hoc acceptance criteria aimed to ensure a sound and consistent asset selection. Criteria are extensively detailed on the forum post.\n\n## Assets Allocation\nA max and min allocation is applied (max cap at 10% and min cap at 1%, respectively).  Additionally, each asset resulting allocation is validated or iteratively adjusted in function of its available liquidity on DEXes, in order to contain the max slippage incurred while purchasing the asset from DEXes.\n\nHere below the proposed allocation\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifm7fnvthnvsjz5ov7tknhppabtvkmmcxodudmg7nbzpsobux5xfu)\n    \nAccording to the available yield strategies on selected assets, the overall index profitability as per current market conditions would currently result in the following\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia5h5ayyn5o4xhikofqrv3f3licqd43bi3wippj3jyu22mqc2hz5m)\n    \n## Do you support the proposed methodology and resulting allocation for the new DeFi index?\n",

      "content": "Relevant discussion can be found here https://forum.piedao.org/t/doughpamine-incentives-program/752/31\n\n## Summary\nAs part of the DeFi Indices revamping initiative the DAO planned to cease the current incentives on both the DeFi+S/ETH and DeFi+L/ETH pools on Balancer. A revised allocation of DOUGHpamine incentives is therefore proposed\n\n## Passing Thresholds:\n-> 5% or more of veDOUGH supply must participate\n-> 60% or more of participating tokens must vote FOR\n\n## Opportunity\n-> Reduction of the annual avg. cost for $ of incentivised liquidity\n-> Promotion of more capital-efficient incentives\n\n## Proposal\nAs part of the DeFi Indices revamping initiative the DAO has planned to cease the current incentives on both the DeFi+S/ETH and DeFi+L/ETH pools on Balancer. Here below a summary of current incentives paid by the DAO (20% liquid, 80% escrowed).\n\n![1.png](ipfs://QmeFuQeEvM8YHsUMWs9YHGUAWRbW6uJdaS7DV6TqTM56jH)\n\nIt looks evident how, despite the overall shrinking of the liquidity provided by LPs, the weighted average annual “cost” (aka. incentives) for single $ of liquidity provided sits at $0.71, reaching picks of $1.52 for pools as the PLAY/DOUGH on Sushi. These incentives clearly account for a big portion of the residual DOUGH selling pressure on the market.\n\nAs a first step in the direction of better preserving the overall DOUGH value, I’m proposing the following:\n\n**1) Reduction of the annual avg. cost for $ of liquidity to an initial target of $0.60** (see allocation below)\n\n![2.png](ipfs://QmadBmPqXevA1JS1xRu5uoJfozUxs3X1oD6kkWpXfyurLG)\n\n**2) Promotion of the BCP pool (staked BCP - single side) with increasing incentives base on the # of units of BCP staked.**\nBCP represents in fact the main liquidity smart-pool for DEFI++, so in light of the upcoming promotion/rebranding of our own DEFI index it could be wise to better incentivise its liquidity provision, which clearly comes with NO IMPERMANENT LOSS for LPs, while also representing a concrete opportunity for them to collect swap fees from the 3 pairs represented (DEFI++ <> ETH, DEFI++ <> wBTC, wBTC <> ETH).\n\n\n![3.png](ipfs://QmZGzjgF5a5fGrKxr2Xrz8sBd5SPSiCAPPAwt74rbMA6Fp)\n\n\nBy considering its annual cost of liquidity, it’s quite evident how BCP represents the most capital-efficient liquidity pool incentivised by PieDAO, hence this proposal.\n\nNOTE: Nominal DOUGH issuance will keep being subject to the deflationary trend voted as part of the DOUGHpamine program (5% reduction every 200k blocks).\n\n## Do you support the proposals above?",

The resulting DOUGH at KPI conversion will be then staked to veDOUGH with a time-lock of 6 months.\n→ The KPI Options will convert 12 months after distribution.\n\nKPI measured\n→ Proportional to stickiness of BDI Liquidity migrated\n→ Min 50% of migrated liquidity should be sticky at conversion for KPI Option to convert to a non-zero value\n→ Liquidity will be tracked as resulting “DEFI++” units after migration, corresponding to the BDI liquidity deposited by holders in the migration contract\n![8d1c61c976d38d45fe94e88947c608b63aed9b98.png](ipfs://QmXcf3pDVmZzC4e7srureLeLn2rYXRA68AeEoBWmPWhFHt)\n\n## Procedure\n→ Migration contract developed by the BastekDAO & PieDAO core teams to be validated by May 7th 2022\n→ BDI holders will be offered the chance to deposit their $BDI in the migration contract, starting from May 12th for a period of 3 weeks.\n→ BDI holders having deposited in the contract will be snapshotted, for distribution of KPI option tokens pro-rata to the amount of BDI deposited.\n→ NOTE: A minimum of 50% of current BDI tokens should be deposited in the migration contract by the end of the 3 weeks for the KPI Option distribution to take place [BDI deposited >= 4372 tokens]\n→ At closure of the BDI deposit, should the 50% threshold be met, the BDI deposited will be migrated to the new “DEFI++” index by PieDAO\n→ BDI token holders having deposited their tokens will receive a NAV-equivalent amount of DEFI++ tokens (NAV values for both BDI & DEFI++ to be computed at migration).\n→ BMI keys to be handed over to PieDAO , so that its liquidity could potentially be migrated over to PieDAO products in the next future\n→ BasketDAO domain + social accounts to be handed over to PieDAO\n\n## Should PieDAO move on with this acquisition proposal?",

A more comprehensive background can be found here [PIP 1- BTC++, BTC on Ethereum diversified](https://forum.piedao.org/t/pip-1-btc-btc-on-ethereum-diversified/68)\n\n## **Specification**\n\nFrom the [analysis](https://forum.piedao.org/t/btc-health-check/1284?u=adrian.a) provided, it seems that the majority of current holders have been there since the “farming” opportunity back in mid 2020, but contributing dust positions overall, denoting an overall lack of Market fit in this product.\n\n## **Proposal**\n\nThe proposed solution would be to discontinue BTC++ from the PieDAO offering. Should this proposal be approved, BTC++ would be added to the deprecated [PieDAO products page](https://legacy.piedao.org/). Current BTC++ holders may either opt to keep their position or exit the pie through the option of Social Exit detailed below:\n\n- PieDAO to share a multisig address for a certain period of time (~ 1 month), where all BTC++ holders could send in their BTC++\n- PieDAO to redeem the liquidity collected and swap for ETH\n- BTC++ holders to receive back an equivalent $value in ETH, after deducting a small 2% fee as partial compensation for the gas cost incurred.\n\n## **Do you support the proposal to discontinue BTC++?**",

      "content": "# Summary\nPieDAO has been discussing the idea of a $PFP pie in various forms for many months, but various issues with how the pie would be constructed have prevented us from formally organizing the product. This proposal being posted on behalf of the TEAM ( [@Adrian.A](https://forum.piedao.org/u/adrian.a), [@BlockEnthusiast](https://forum.piedao.org/u/blockenthusiast), [@antodp](https://forum.piedao.org/u/antodp), [@Gabo](https://forum.piedao.org/u/gabo), [@hamball](https://forum.piedao.org/u/hamball), [@naan](https://forum.piedao.org/u/naan), [@RichAndCreamy](https://forum.piedao.org/u/richandcreamy)) how has lead the efforts to move the product forward in a realistic and timely manner.\n\n> Full Discussion link: [https://forum.piedao.org/t/nft-index-creation-updated-pfp-index-proposal/1273/5](https://forum.piedao.org/t/nft-index-creation-updated-pfp-index-proposal/1273/5)\n# Motivation\nThe NFT space is large and broadening quickly. As a DAO, we started exploring this investment space with our pie, $PLAY which has a focus on metaverse gaming. Earlier iterations of $PLAY included small amounts of PFP coins such as $PUNK and $MASK, which were eventually removed during processes to narrow the scope of the product. However, we believe that the initial inclusion of these assets was an early indication of interest in a now-large PFP / NFT art space that is emerging as its own sector, with markedly different dynamics than gaming projects.\n# Specification/Scope\nIn the [first proposal to build a $PFP pie](https://forum.piedao.org/t/pip-61-pfp-pie/972), the mechanism that was suggested to fund the underlying assets was a pie made up of shares from NFTX floor-priced vaults. However, it became clear that this approach was not currently possible due to issues with liquidity, which would prohibitively limit both the maximum size of the pie and the diversity/quality of assets it could contain. While this kind of approach may be possible in the future as organizations like FloorDAO release their products to supplement liquidity, the team has decided to propose an alternative model to the $PFP pie.\n# Proposed Model\nIn the model the team is now proposing, the pie would take the form of a closed investment fund, with the DAO organizing an initial funding round where participants could deposit ETH into a smart contract during a specified period and receive tokens in proportion to their contribution.\n\nAssuming a successful fund raise, a $NFT fund administration and curation group would then use the ETH collected to purchase NFTs meeting a clearly defined set of criteria developed with input from the DAO.\n\nNFTs would be purchased at ‘floor’ prices from collections with sufficient supply and liquidity to allow the tokens to be easily valued, purchased, and liquidated. With the evolution of the space toward multifaceted utility that extends beyond use of an NFT as a profile picture, the team anticipates expanding beyond PFP projects and including other high-value NFTs with long-term potential.\n\nIf a minimum amount of ETH is not reached during the initial fundraise, contributors would receive a refund.\n\nAfter a predetermined amount of time, the NFTs purchased by this fund would be liquidated, and any holders of the $NFT token would be distributed a proportional share of the ETH that resulted from the sales.\n\nDepending on implementation cost and complexity, we may also choose to open the fund at regular intervals before the liquidation period to allow new capital contributions and/or token redemptions. These would occur at a valuation determined through a methodology developed by the team and published at the time of the initial fundraise (rather than calculated through an oracle or similar automated technology).\n\nThe team believe this approach will result in a product that is:\n- Safe\n- Understandable\n- Easily traded and accessible\n- Comparatively inexpensive to build vs. oracle-based alternatives\n- Quick to launch, meeting demand from new users flooding the NFT space\n\nAs a bonus, a new product type will be added to PieDAO’s technical portfolio, which can be used in a wide range of scenarios that involve assets that are non-fungible, illiquid, and/or difficult to value.\n\n# Risks & Potential Mitigation\n| Risk | Description | Potential Mitigation |\n| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |\n| Curators / Project Team | Use of human curators introduces risk of poor investment decisions or malicious actions| Multisig authentication for fund wallet; veto / comment period for investment decisions |\n| Market Risk | NFT market is highly volatile; many projects go to zero value in bear market conditions | Well-defined asset allocation strategy that includes blue-chip / established collections |\n| Collection-Specific Risk | Risk of rugs, IP violations, malicious or poorly-written contracts\t| 3rd party and/or PieDAO audits of contracts for projects included in index; require doxxed founders and/or legitimate companies operating collection |\n| Legal | Model is a departure from PieDAO’s other products and may have different liability implications for PieDAO and project team\t| Legal opinion / advice on fund structure |\n\n# Team\n| Role | Team Member(s) |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n|Project Lead|Hamball|\n|Project Management|Naan, Rich|\n|Finance|TBD|\n|Periodically refresh / maintain analysis|TBD|\n|NFT Diligence|TBD|\n|Marketing|TBD|\n|Consultants / Advisors|Block|\n|Liaison w/ Development Team|Adrian|\n|Development Team|PieDAO core dev team|\n# Next Steps/Closing Notes\nWhile the team recognizes that this model has changed significantly from the original proposal, we believe that it is important to get a product released to capture the growing interest in the NFT sector from investors who would like to diversify their options. We expect that the DAO will have questions, but we believe that this method of construction is the best possible in the short term. Since this method has a built-in end date, it allows for reevaluation in the future as the technology to power other solutions is developed.\n\nIf this proposal is approved, next steps would be to:\n- Define the technology and UX to be used, and establish a product development roadmap and timeline\n- Establish revenue mechanisms and incentives for the DAO, technology contributors, marketing/BD, and the administration and curation team\n- Obtain legal input on the model to ensure acceptable liability for PieDAO and the administration/curation group\n- Create the criteria for selection of NFTs, valuation methodology, and other guidelines and policies according to which the administration team will operate\n\n# Do you support this proposal to continue the efforts on this NFT pie creation?\n",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nA clear governance process is key for the DAO future. Clear guidelines help members to promote their ideas to become without the uncertainty created by unclear or scattered resources and guidelines. This proposal presents a life-cycle that upgrades our current processes and deliver a step-by-step guide that can be followed by any member.\n\n- [Full Discussion](https://forum.piedao.org/t/pip-69-governance-voting-framework/1232)\n- Note: The proposal has received a good support on the Forum polls, showing over 90% acceptance withing the poll participants.\n\n# Motivation & Scope\n\nWe expect to address the following points to allow proposals to be positioned for voting only after achieving an execution-ready status depending on their complexity.\n\n- Segregate Complex from Simpler proposals\n- Defining an approach that uses Gates and Stages\n- Creation of a workbooks and templates\n- Define Votes types and characteristics\n- Quality assurance and community suppor through a moderator position\n\nWe propose to introduce the following changes\n\n## **1. Governance**\n\n### **1.1 Categories**\n\nVotes types are categorized in two main categories, and each one serve their own process flow\n\n- Improvement proposals\n- Generic Proposals\n\n### **1.2 Vote Types**\n\nAll votes casted in Snapshot should be following one of these categories and consider the durations given below as the minimum required for their length. Types are categorized between **Critical** and **Non Critical.**\n\n### **1.3 Gate Baker**\n\nModeration is a need to assure that:\n\n- Members support and education over the proposal flow\n- To assure submitted votes have met the gate-ready criterias\n- Keep a DB for the submitted roles and segregate valid from invalid votes to support the Governance Mining eligibility criteria process\n- Moderate the forum to lead conversations and keep conversations momentum and on topic.\n\n## **2. Introducing Gates**\n\nGates will act as check points designed to drive proposals efficiently and require a Snapshot vote. The amount of Gates will depend on the proposal type\n\n- **Improvement Proposals:** Gate 1 >> Validation >> Gate 2 >> Execution\n- **Generic Proposals:** Gate 1 >> Execution\n\n### **2.3 Considerations**\n\n- **PIP Acceptance Criteria**\n    - In order to pass a PIP: 5% or more of veDOUGH supply must participate (current_supply * 0.05 = result), and 60% or more of participating tokens must vote in favor (FOR)\n- **Maintenance**\n    - Casted votes not following the gate steps won’t be considered for the Governance Mining Rewards eligibility process. The only exception will be Critical votes types.\n    - Snapshot entries will not be removed from the system.\n- **Naming Convention**\n    - Proposals can or can not have a PIP number. Either case it is expected that they follow the following naming structure to facilitate reading\n        - Without PIP # → [Gate #] Proposal title\n        - With a PIP # → [PIP-#] [Gate #] Proposal title\n\n## **3. Introducing Stages**\n\nStages are all the steps and activites that happen between gates, which do not require a Snapshot vote. They tick all the boxes for the conversation to move towards a gate vote in good shape, and determine the flow expected for the whole lyfe-cycle of each proposal type.\n\n### **3.1 Generic proposal stages**\n\n- **Forum Discussion**: Proposed Idea to be discussed in the Forum\n- **Gate 1:** Validate the community agreement through a vote\n- **Production Release:** Execute the proposal\n\n### **3.2 PIP stages**\n\n- **Forum Discussion:** Proposed Idea to be discussed in the Forum\n- **PIP Gate 1:** Gauge members support on the Idea\n- **PIP Refinement:** Improvement Proposal refinement\n- **PIP Validation:** Validation of Scope\n- **PIP Staging:** Proposal pre-gate Staging\n- **PIP Gate 2:** PIP Voting\n- **Production Release:** Execute the proposal\n\n### **4. Processes flows charts**\n\nFlows are visual aid images to understand what to do on each step, and they vary depending on the Proposal type.\n\n- **Generic Proposal Flow**\n- **PIP Flow**\n    - **Standard Proposal Flow**\n    - **Pie Proposal Flow**\n\n# Benefits & Risks\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe PieDAO Governance process has been defined in several documents that are currently not linked to one another. This can create friction and uncertainty for users to submit ideas and for community members to visualize next steps. While studying the current status, two discussions opened the door to rethink the current Idea→PIP→Vote flow to include a broather set of definitions to bootstrap the whole process.\n\n## Risks\n\nNo risks identified\n\n# Next Steps\n\nIf the community vote in favor of this proposal, the next steps will be:\n\n1. Manage all new votes under the approved process\n2. Kick-off the Gate Baker role to start assisting new entries\n3. Publish the process on PieDAO docs\n\n# Closing notes\n\nClarity during the process, good level of support, visibility on the next steps and MVP quality standards assurance are the key deliverables that will make us implement great products and changes and facilitate the decision making for the PieDAO community members. \n\nWe ask votes to show their support **For** or **Against** the current proposal, or to select **Detail more** if you think it’s not ready yet for implementation.",

      "content": "Should PieDAO partner with OlympusDAO to acquire liquidity positions for our protocol?\n\n\"Invest in the future of your favorite protocol.\" -Olympus\n\nOver 20 DAOs have partnered with Olympus PRO to list bonding opportunities on the Olympus PRO Bond Marketplace. Protocols have the opportunity to select a LP token that yield farmers can bond [sell to the DAO] at a discount, receiving a governance token in return. For example, PieDAO could offer DOUGH in exchange for yield farmers bonding their DOUGH/ETH LP token from Sushi.  As a result, PieDAO would add a revenue-generating LP position to the treasury and the yield farmer would acquire a discounted token from a protocol that that is now stronger financially as a result of the bonding. \n\nHere is an example of a DAO that has acquired liquidity via OlympusDAO: BanklessDAO has acquired over $588,000 in the BANK/ETH LP token in the last couple months. If a yield farmer was to sell their position to Bankless DAO today, they would receive a 8.5% ROI [In the form of discounted BANKLESS DAO tokens] on their bonded capital. \n\n\"The problem with existing yield farms: \n\nLiquidity leaves farms at an alarming rate. 42% of yield farmers that enter a farm on the day it launches exit within 24 hours. Around 16% leave within 48 hours, and by the third day, 70% of these users would have withdrawn from the contract.\n\nThe Olympus Pro Solution:\n\nBonds vest over a period of days set by the protocol and you are free to claim any pro-rata share. When users purchase Bonds through Olympus Pro, it allows Protocols to accumulate liquidity to secure longevity and price stability for everyone involved. This makes bonds a mutually beneficial exchange.\" \n\n-Olympus\n\nResources:\nhttps://www.olympusdao.finance/pro",

      "content": "Full discussion can be found in this forum thread\nhttps://forum.piedao.org/t/pip-68-kpi-options-redeemable-asset/1176\n\nSUMMARY\nThe KPI tokens were distributed weeks ago, and this vote intends to determine how the distribution would be done.\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe reason for choosing veDOUGH vs DOUGH as the asset for redemption of the KPI Options lies in the clear intent to avoid flooding the DOUGH circulation supply with up to 5M tokens at the moment of conversion. This would in fact invalidate the whole case built around the creation of incentives in order to pursue a higher % of staked DOUGH out of its entire circulating supply.\n\nThe possibility to have the KPI Option backed by veDOUGH was somehow aired since the very early convo held with the UMA tech team. Unfortunately this wasn’t possible with their standard contracts, consequently the initial proposal posted on the PieDAO forum referred to DOUGH as the asset backing the KPI Options. Same for the initial snapshot vote signaling support by the community for this initiative.\n\nAs part of the discussion triggered by such proposal, the community has been further exploring the possibility to still get veDOUGH as asset backing the KPI Options, requiring the development of a wrapper taking care of converting the KPI Option to veDOUGH at expiration. This solution was eventually conceptualized and developed shortly after by the core team for the reasons above.\n\nIn order to avoid gray areas on which should eventually be the asset to be distributed at expiration of the KPI Options (March 2022), we would propose to the community to formally select one among the 3 following solutions:\n\nA) Options redeemed as veDough\nB) Options redeemed as Dough\nC) Both A & B + an incentive to choose veDough\n\nSPECIFICALLY\nOption A) corresponds to the current implementation of the KPI Option, developed by putting the above mentioned wrapper in place that allows options to be redeemed automatically as veDough. Main benefit of this option is undoubtedly the possibility to avoid selling pressure on our governance token DOUGH, while at the same time incentivizing the long term alignment from our community members to PieDAO.\n\nOption B) Options redeemed liquid as DOUGH, with the main downside being its dilution and negative price impact, and the extra cost for those willing to eventually stake those tokens to veDOUGH.\n\nOption C) User would select either A or B at the conversion of the KPI Options. This would provide the option to allow each address to choose whether or not to stake their tokens, with unknown effect on the DOUGH Circulation supply and price. Additionally, as per the forum discussion, further incentives will be discussed if this option is chosen in order to drive users towards veDough.",

The team at Linear Finance believes now is the perfect time to expand our partnership with PieDAO and enable users access to yet another PieDAO managed portfolio on Linear.Exchange, the PLAY Metaverse NFT Index.\n\nListing a synthetic PLAY Metaverse NFT Index (ℓPLAY) on Linear.Exchange will benefit both protocols as PieDAO will gain more exposure to the thousands of Linear.Exchange users and the Linear Community will be able to invest in a solid Metaverse & NFT Index “baked” by the best in the industry!\n\n## Specification\nThe launching of a new PieDAO branded synthetic index on Linear.Exchange means that:\n\n1) PieDAO will compose and maintain a PieDAO branded synthetic index, providing Linear Finance with the methodology and assets allocation on a monthly basis - i.e. monthly rebalancing.\n\n2) Linear Finance will list the index on Linear.Exchange and recognise to PieDAO a service fee of 0.1% of the monthly traded volume in USDT, or 1,000 USDT/USDC if the index has less than 1 million in monthly traded volume.\n\n3) Linear Finance & PieDAO will work together to promote the strength and institutional level research conducted by the PieDAO team, the PieDAO synthetic PLAY Metaverse NFT Index on Binance Smart chain and any public blockchains that are used by Linear, the PieDao indexes on ETH Chain, and leverage respective communities to spread awareness of each ecosystem.\n\n4) Linear Finance will commit marketing resources and dollars to spread awareness and promotion on all social media platforms and relevant media/PR agencies.\n\n*** If approved, a Technology Agreement will be exchanged, stipulating the detailed terms and conditions ***\n\n## Do you support the above proposal for the creation of a Synthetic PLAY Metaverse index jointly by Linear Finance x PieDAO?\n",

      "content": "Relevant discussion can be found here\nhttps://forum.piedao.org/t/pip-59-play-metaverse-index-prospectus/977/10\n\n## Summary\nTwo issues seem to affect the current PLAY allocation:\n-> \"Long tail\" of not meaningful allocations. The 9 smallest allocations account for 10% of PLAY in total\n-> Thin liquidity on DEXes for several assets \n\n## Specification\nFew issues seem to currently represent a bottleneck to PLAY' scalability:\n\n1) Several items compose a “long tail” of not very meaningful allocations (the sum of 9 smallest allocations account for 10% of PLAY in total), despite having introduced a min 2% allocation for each asset during the past rebalance.\nIn order to position PLAY on multiple venues (L2 included) PieDAO could be ideally leveraging on some professional support for its market making (MM). Still this long tail makes the required hedging almost impossible for many underlying assets.\n\n2) The thin liquidity available on DEXes for several assets is representing a concrete bottleneck for the minting of decent-sized batches of PLAY. Furthermore, for assets with most of liquidity on Uniswap V3, this can result even more challenging due to its range-concentrated allocation.\nThe need to limit the size of each batch exponentially boost up the gas cost incurred when minting liquidity for PLAY. \nVice-versa, the minting of bigger batches incurs in consistent slippage.\n\n## Proposed solutions\nA possible way to address the above issues would include the following solutions:\n\n**A) Removing all assets with negligible liquidity on DEXes + capping the allocation of each asset so to always keep its slippage below 2% when minting PLAY** (this by making each asset’s allocation also a function of its DEX liquidity)\n\n**B) Drastically cutting the current long tail of micro-allocation**, bringing the PLAY underlying assets down to the 8 most relevant assets\n\nThe joint application of both solutions proposed (A + B) would result in an allocation optimised form a liquidity standpoint, allowing the minting of up to $1m of PLAY in a single transaction, with total slippage < 1%.\n\n## Do you support any of these solutions proposed to optimize the PLAY scalability?",

      "title": "[PIP-67] Creation of an eDough to veDough bridge",
      "content": "Full discussion can be found in this forum thread\nhttps://forum.piedao.org/t/proposal-creation-of-an-edough-to-vedough-bridge/1005\n\n\n## Summary\nWe propose that a bridge be created to swap eDOUGH to veDOUGH with a non-configurable time lock of 3 years. Only eDOUGH that has vested for 6+months will be eligible for this bridge. Additionally we propose that unclaimed rewards be made claimable as 100% veDOUGH (i.e. no 80-20 split) with a 6month time lock.\n\n## Background\nTreasury farming will soon be launching for PieDao, this means those who hold DOUGH (distinct from the token eDOUGH) will be able to stake for a yield payed out in the new SLICE pie. DOUGH is the governance token for PieDao while eDough is an escrowed version of the token payed out to those who support the dao by providing liquidity. The proposal that implemented this change did not discuss what would occur with eDOUGH.\n\n## Motivation\nCurrently we are faced with a handful of issues, in no particular order:\n\neDough is ineligible for its previous only function - voting.\nThis may be desirable for those who purchased Dough on the open market as excluding those who have previously committed capital to the Dao would give them an advantage in % of those staking, however I think the cost of this (alienating those previously assisting the Dao, possibly of sell pressure) outweighs the APR gain.Those who hold mostly eDough will have the majority of their funds excluded from first (several?) month of rewards already.\n\neDough positions will begin unlocking in November which may begin a sell off in the market\nFor obvious reasons it is always desirable to alleviate sell pressure.\n\nAs a PieDao LP you will soon need to perform 3 actions to fully take advantage of rewards\nClaim eDough Rewards -> swap to Dough -> stake for veDough. All at mainnet prices and, for our American friends, with complicated tax implications.\n\n## Specification\nWe propose to solve the above issues a bridge be constructed to swap eDough to 3-year locked veDough with no option to configure the time lock. Preventing time lock configuration means the most benefit for the DAO as it guarantees long term commitment to the protocol while also maximizing the reward for the individual. Only eDough that has vested for 6months would be eligible for this bridge to prevent mass inflation of veDough. Those who are very close to the end of their escrow period and do not wish to stake (or swap to veDough) can exit their position and the normal time. In doing this we relieve a great deal of sell pressure, allow holders of eDough to enter into a staked position with only 1 transaction, realign all community interests, and effectively re-enable eDough holders voting rights.\n\nAdditionally, we propose that all claimable rewards be made claimable as 100% 6month staked veDough versus the existing 20% Dough 80% eDough scheme. This resolve issues LPs run into in the number of mainnet transactions required to full utilize their rewards and increases time lock in the protocol, further decreases sell pressure, and encourages investment in the protocol.\n\nThese two above solutions may launch at separate times due to complexity differences in implementation or other issues.\n\n## Do you agree to the creation of an eDOUGH to veDOUGH bridge?",

      "content": "There has been some concern expressed about Slice issuing rewards from the same Pie every month. If this happens, Slice would essentially become backed by a single Pie. To keep this from happening, I propose the following actions.\n\n•\tFirst, if a Pie is chosen to be the Slice distribution for the previous month. It cannot be selected in the next month. This would keep Slice from being dominated by a single Pie but could result in Slice being dominated by two Pies. Likely, these Pie’s would end up being BCP and PLAY.\t\n\n•\tSecond, if a Pie is chosen to be the Slice distribution, it cannot be selected again for two months. This would keep Slice from being dominated. However, there is the issue of Slice becoming less desirable if every third month a less used Pie is issued as a reward. On a positive side, it would make Slice a more accurate representation of the PieDAO universe with holders having a wider variety of the available Pies.\n\n•\tThird, maintain the current system and allow for all Pie’s to be available to choose from each month.\n\n\n\n",

The Pie would be minted by the Treasury Committee employing assets of their choice among those part of the treasury.\n\n## Specification\nThe first Reward Pie (SLICE) would be currently composed of approx 15 different assets, among which\na) assets forming the DAO Fee Pot, inclusive of Pie Streaming fees & Exit Fees on incentivised pools charged overtime;\nb) BAL farmed by LP positions held by PieDAO,\nc) multiple assets forming the Treasury Proceeds resulting from both the Active Management of treasury assets & Farming strategies deployed by the Treasury Committee.\n\nThe above SLICE would result costly to redeem, requiring the seeding of a market for SLICE.\n\n**A wiser approach would point instead toward having an exiting Pie as underlying asset of SLICE**\n\n## Main Benefits\n- use of current existing markets, instead of recurring to the creation of new ones,\n- self-feeding TVL mechanism for PieDAO\n- process could be actively employed to bootstrap liquidity for new pies\n- turns rewards from an unmanaged basket to a managed one\n- rewards could also become yield bearing, depending on the Pie distributed \n\n**Based on the above, the current proposal would suggest to employ either PLAY or BCP as first Pie for distribution within SLICE, to be minted by the Treasury Committee employing assets of their choice among those part of the treasury (thus potentially keeping ready-to-farm assets that could be put to work right away).**\n\n## What would be the preferred composition of the first SLICE, to be distributed as of early November to active DAO members?",

Having rewards as BCP/PLAY is a good way to increase TVL with rewards but does not achieve the same goal so it should not be seen as an equivalent alternative. These propositions would be addressing different needs.\n\nA practical way to provide this veDOUGH compounding option starting from the first distribution occurring in November would be the following:\n\n**1) Any active DAO member willing to compound to veDOUGH could claim his/her SLICE, and send it to the DAO multisig**\n\n**2) The DAO multisig would be whitelisted in the staking contract in order to be able staking DOUGH on behalf of 3rd parties, which would be receiving the corresponding amount of veDOUGH (36 months staked).**\n\n**3) On a weekly basis, the core team would publish a SLICE/DOUGH conversion rate based on 3days average DOUGH price and SLICE NAV, and mint to each address sending in SLICE an equivalent amount of veDOUGH + some additional veDOUGH as a lump sum to cover the gas spent on the 2 transactions to claim and send the SLICE in**\n\n## Would you like to include this option to convert SLICE to veDOUGH, compounding your staking rewards?",

      "content": "Full discussion can be found in this forum thread https://forum.piedao.org/t/pip-62-uma-kpi-options-for-dough-staking/1004\n\n**Summary**\nThis is a proposal to use UMA’s KPI options 2 to align community incentives and boost the percentage of DOUGH staked in recently announced DOUGH Staking & Governance Mining 1.\n\n**The Relevance to PieDAO**\nWith the launch of Staking, the efforts of the PieDAO community are concentrated towards the ‘north star’ metric that has been defined as having at least 30% of DOUGH circulating supply locked in the staking contract. I believe issuing KPI options is a great way to coordinate these efforts and add cryptoeconomic incentives on top.\n\n**Specification**\nBelow is the proposed scope of the KPI Options for DOUGH staking:\n\n- Proposed Airdrop targets: pro-rata to all veDOUGH holders\n- Proposed Airdrop date: at first reward Pie minting\n- Options expiration date: in 6 months, ie. 31st March 2022\n- Metric tracked: total amount of DOUGH staked\n- KPI Option backed by: DOUGH\n- Proposed total amount of KPI options: 10 million units\n- Maximum option converting value: 0.5 DOUGH per option, if 15m or higher ‘staked DOUGH’ KPI is hit.\n\nTotal option payout per KPI hit: growing in a step function, as below:\n- 1M DOUGH Total Payout, with 7,5M DOUGH staked\n- 2M DOUGH Total Payout, with 10M DOUGH staked\n- 5M DOUGH Total Payout, with 15M DOUGH staked\n\nIn case this proposal gets accepted, a total amount of 5M DOUGH should be moved out of the PieDAO Treasury in order to be used as collateral for the minting of the 10M KPI options at this page https://projects.umaproject.org/0x79b6BD0FC723746bC9eAEFeF34613cF4596E6dEF\n\nYou are called to give your support to this initiative:\n- a **YES** approves the initiative of using KPI Option Tokens as incentive for the upcoming DOUGH staking initiative\n- a **NO** rejects the whole initiative\n",

      "content": "Full discussion in the [forum thread](https://forum.piedao.org/t/pip-61-pfp-pie/972).\n\n**Rationale**\nThe NFT space is large and broadening quickly. $PLAY is a great product, and has performed extremely well with its focus on metaverse gaming. The inclusion of small amounts of profile pic NFT vaults $PUNK and $MASK was, I think, an early indication of interest in a now-large PFP space that is emerging as its own sector, with markedly different dynamics than gaming projects.\n\n$PFP is a new pie that attempts to track the floor prices of blue chip profile pic projects, giving investors diversified exposure to investment-grade PFP space.\n\n**Specs & Allocation**\nOverall, 13 assets qualified for inclusion in PFP. Allocations were chosen based on the pie's asset inclusion criteria referenced in the [proposed prospectus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zeO4llpSeuqRFTNSl4pNYLc-JV-_eEWEPLnxZ9yWav8/edit), based on market cap with a \"booster\" for project longevity, with a max 40% allocation and min 2% allocation. Note that all assets that passed the criteria at this time are ERC20 tokens from NFTX Vaults.\n\nPUNK:\t\t\t40.00%\nBAYC:\t\t\t\t12.00%\nPURR:\t\t\t\t8.77%\nMEEB:\t\t\t\t6.37%\nMASK:\t\t\t6.00%\nKITTY:\t\t\t5.80%\nCOOL:\t\t\t5.08%\nAVASTR:\t\t4.58%\nBGAN:\t\t\t2.60%\nMOONCAT:\t2.40%\nPUDGY:\t\t\t2.38%\nDUCK:\t\t\t2.01%\nFLUF:\t\t\t\t2.01%\n\nAllocations will be updated and rebalanced according to the policy & procedure defined in the prospectus, or as amended by PieDAO governance.\n\n$PFP will use the [PieVault](https://github.com/pie-dao/PieVaults) architecture and include a 1% streaming fee to the DAO.\n\n**Vote & Next Steps**\nIf this vote passes, it signifies community authorization to launch the proposed $PFP pie.\n\nSome launch details will be left to the discretion of the core team, such as development prioritization, token icon, and final adjustments to the allocations to reflect any changes to the allocation criteria between vote and launch.\n\nIn a subsequent vote, the DAO may or may not choose to create a [Pie Working Group](https://forum.piedao.org/t/pie-working-groups/877/) to coordinate the pie's launch and AUM growth.\n\n",

This issue was so far mitigated by employing a wrapped version of the token ($wATRI), which anyhow creates complexity when buying tokens through the recipe for minting new $PLAY, since only integer units should be bought.\n\nNEW Assets proposed to be included in $PLAY since fully meeting the criteria\n\n3. **$ILV - Illuvium** https://www.illuvium.io/\n4. **$AUDIO - Audius** https://audius.co/\n5. **$ERN - Ethernity** Chain https://ethernity.io/\n6. **$GALA - Gala** Games https://app.gala.games/\n\nThrough this vote you are called to express your preference on each of the assets mentioned above, regarding:\na) **its REMOVAL from $PLAY** at first rebalancing, for each asset currently part of $PLAY but not satisfying all criteria\nb) **its INCLUSION in $PLAY** at first rebalancing, for each asset proposed by the community which meets the inclusion criteria\n\nAll applicable preferences should be selected (multiple choices).",

      "content": "**PIP**: 60\n**Title**: DOUGH Staking & Governance Mining\n**Status**: Discussed, PIP Stage\n**Author(s)**: @alexintosh\n**Created**: Aug 27, 2021\n**Discussion**: https://forum.piedao.org/t/pip-60-dough-staking-governance-mining/954\n\n## Summary\nProposal to approve and deploy DOUGH Staking & Governance mining program. DOUGH Staking creates a value accrual mechanism for token holders by promoting long-term alignment and rewards active participation in the DAO with cashflow.\n\n## Background\nThe PieDAO community has long discussed implementing single asset staking for DOUGH, as well as a mechanism for fee distribution. \n\nThe DOUGH staking design is shaped to add **valuable utility**, promote **long-term alignment**, and **encourage participation** in the decision-making process.\n\nThe proposed staking framework serves as a mechanism to distribute protocol fees as well as other revenues generated by the DAO.\n\n## Implementation\n\n- [Smart Contracts - DOUGH Staking](https://github.com/pie-dao/dough-staking).\n- [Deployment preview (Rinkeby)](https://deploy-preview-185--nightly-pools-piedao.netlify.app/#/new_staking)\n- [DOUGH Staking Subgraph](https://github.com/pie-dao/piedao-subgraph-development)\n\n\n## Specification\n#### High-level concept:\n\n- Governance Mining means revenues are shared with DOUGH stakers actively participating in governance.\n- Long-term committed capital is more valuable than short-term committed capital, for this reason, long commitments are granted with extra incentives such as more voting power and a higher portion of rewards.\n- veDOUGH holders (aka DOUGH Stakers) receive cash flow in a diverse basket of tokens knows as \"Reward Pie\".\n\n### veDOUGH\nveDOUGH uses a lock-up weight system. The number of veDOUGH obtained by staking DOUGH is determined by two elements: The `stakedAmount` of DOUGH and the `timeCommitment`. \n\nLocking DOUGH is allowed for a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 36 months. The multiplier follows the curve: `y=x/k*log(x)`\n\nAfter the lockup expires, the user can withdraw their stake and **will not be able to vote anymore**.\n\nAnyone can call the `eject` function to push out an expired lockup and force-unstake the tokens for that address, as such anyone can make sure free riding is prevented.\n\n**Quorum requirement for veDOUGH**\nIn order to pass a PIP 5% of the total supply of veDOUGH has to vote of which 60% in favour of the proposal.\n\n### The Reward Pie\nThe Reward Pie is a regular [PieVault](https://github.com/pie-dao/PieVaults) where the function `joinPool` is disabled.\n\nThe RewardsPie is used to distribute the DAO's revenues. The underlying assets of the RewardsPie will not be used productively and are therefore enabled for meta-governance at any time.\n\n**Definition of revenues**\n1. Fees accrued in the [Fee Pot](https://zapper.fi/account/0xaf2fe0d4fe879066b2baa68d9e56cc375df22815), coming from either Pies or DOUGHpamine (~$118k).\n2. Farmed tokens by the treasury . See [Treasury Farming Committee](https://forum.piedao.org/t/treasury-farming-initialization/892/9).\n\n*(Optional)* The DAO might decide to add to the Reward Pie rewards in DOUGH.\n\n**Revenues distribution breakdown**\n* 60% is directly distributed to veDOUGH holders\n* 25% is used to compound the treasury principle\n* 15% is used to cover operational costs.\n\n### Governance Mining\n\nThe veDOUGH contract had an embedded system to gate the claim of rewards. It does that by using a merkle root to verify that the address claiming is eligible to do so. This system allows for participation to be tracked offchain and therefore easily evolve over time.\n\n**Definition of active participation**\n- veDOUGH holders who did at least one vote during the last 30 days are able claim their rewards.\n- veDOUGH holders idle for >90 days have their rewards redistributed to everybody else.\n\n## Resources\n[ Long-term Alignment in Cryptonetworks & DAOs](https://boardroom.mirror.xyz/bbsycl6pCNQ4503O8Cqkq7yaI3uJtJ4LhI9zj91-E-M)‌\n\n\n## Conclusions\n\nBy voting \"Make it happen\" you agree for the DAO to:\n1. Deploy the staking & veDOUGH contracts (See: implementation section).\n2. Deploy the Rewards Pie.\n3. Distribute DAO Revenues to veDOUGH Holders according to \"Revenues distribution breakdown\".\n4. Change the current snapshot strategy to only allow veDOUGH holders to vote.\n5. Accept only PIPs that have the \"Quorum requirement for veDOUGH\"\n\nBy voting \"Do nothing\" you agree for the DAO to:\n1. Keep the status quo and do nothing.\n\n\n‌",

Project connected to the development of the Metaverse, Gaming or NFT ecosystems on Ethereum\n2. Token Issued and aligned to the ERC20 standard\n3.  Asset is fractionable (minimum 2 decimals)\n4. Sufficient DEX Liquidity exists\n5. Token has been around for min 60 days\n6. Audit Passed\n\n**2 - Methodology for Allocation**\nUnderlying allocations to be adjusted by introducing the following criteria:\n-> Allocation capped so that its $ value is <= 10% of DEX $ liquidity \n-> Momentum of the asset Market Cap over the past 30 days\n->  Minimum allocation of 2% for each underlying asset\n-> Max allocation of 30% for single large cap holding\n-> Max cumulative allocation of 60% for top 3 cap holdings\n\n**3 . Rule and Procedures for rebalancing**\n\nTriggers for rebalancing\n1) Max allocation of largest holding > 50% for 7 consecutive days\n2) Max cumulative allocation of top 3 holdings > 80% for 7 consecutive days\n\nRebalancing Urgency\n1) Minimum of 1 rebalancing every 6 months should take place\n2) Maximum o1 rebalancing per calendar month deemed as acceptable\n3) New assets inclusion to be considered at first available rebalancing\n\n**Do you accept the Prospectus proposed for $PLAY?**\n-> a YES votes in favour of the adoption above PROSPECTUS for $PLAY\n-> a NO rejects the above and bring the discussion back to the forum",

      "content": "***SUMMARY***\nThis proposal introduces the role of the Treasury Farming Committee, as an independent board of professionals formed to provide suggestions to PieDAO on ways of allocating and utilizing its Treasury.\n\nThe Committee holds the following goals:\n-> Diversify: Maintaining an allocation that lowers the risk of concentrated exposure and ensures operations can continue during bearish market conditions.\n-> Positive inflow: Ensure returns on treasury farming and protocol exceed the cost of operation and bring value to token holders governing the protocol.\n-> Aim for perpetuity: Creating the condition to enable the DAO to operate forever.\n\nCommittee Members (subject to 3months probation):\n1) Federico Nitidi, Strategist\n2) @blockEnthusiast, Strategist\n3) @jnova, Coordinator\n4) Nansen - www.nansen.ai, Data Analytics\n\nProposed Committee compensation (a+b+c):\na) 2k EUR/month\nb) 100k DOUGH/year (12 months linearly vested, 3months cliff)\nc) Monthly Performance bonus = paid ONLY when Treasury value (end of month) exceeds the benchmark (initial value increased by a “risk-free” rate). Bonus proportional to the net alpha generated, paid fully liquid in $DOUGH.\n\n***INITIAL GOALS***\n1) Establishing an initial position leaning more neutral vs market volatility\n2) Moving the treasury into a farmable state.\n\nThe above will require the migration of funds to a newly created Treasury multi-sig (https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0x3bCF3Db69897125Aa61496Fc8a8B55A5e3f245d5), from where the initial rebalancing and farming strategies will be implemented.\nCurrent multi-sig signers (3 out of 5):\n1) Federico Nitidi\n2) @jnova\n3) @alexintosh\n4) @nico\n5) @gabo_o\n\n***GOING FORWARD***\n-> Committee will be meeting weekly, developing a framework for rating PieDAO's exposure, as well as market conditions which may influence future decisions. \n-> Committee will be working on further diversification, with likely suggestions of further shifting into stables given the current market condition.\n-> A PieDAO member acts as a Coordinator and liaison between this Committee and the broader community, discussing potential treasury positions to eventually ensure an exciting level of treasury growth.\n\nPlease see full details here https://forum.piedao.org/t/treasury-farming-initialization/892\n\nA YES votes in favour of all points above\nA NO votes against all points above, bringing back the discussion to the forum.",

      "content": "**Summary**\nThis proposal is an invitation to the PieDAO to partner with Linear Finance and bring to market a PieDAO branded synthetic DeFi index to Linear.Exchange and further, to explore, discuss and present other opportunities that drive adoption and are mutually beneficial to both ecosystems.\n\n**Motivation & Scope**\nAs a cross-chain compatible synthetic assets protocol, Linear Finance strives to increase inclusiveness and democratize access to digital and traditional assets and with PieDAO on a mission to bring automated wealth creation to everyone with an internet connection, there lies a perfect opportunity to join forces and create a partnership between the two. The partnership will establish synergies that create easier and fairer access to managed portfolios for DeFi users across blockchains. Through a partnership and subsequent creation and listing of a synthetic DeFi index on Linear.Exchange users will be able to get access to a PieDAO managed portfolio on Binance Smart Chain and soon also Polkadot, while being able to trade in and out of portfolio positions at a low cost, without slippage and in size due to Linear Finance’s protocol architecture.\n\nA partnership between PieDAO and Linear Finance for launching a PieDAO branded synthetic index on Linear.Exchange would mean:\n\n1. PieDAO will compose and maintain a PieDAO branded synthetic index based on PieDAO DeFi Indexes.\n2. PieDAO will provide Linear Finance the methodology used to create the index and provide updates if any changes are made.\n3. PieDAO will provide Linear finance the data set with weightings in spreadsheet format in a timely manner on the 3rd week of every month, i.e. monthly rebalancing.\n4. Linear Finance will list the index on Linear.Exchange and the price of the synthetic index will be based on data feed from Linear Finance oracle partners as there is no underlying.\n5. Linear Finance will pay the PieDAO treasury a service fee of 0.1% of the monthly traded volume in USDT or 1,000 USDT if the index has less than 1 million in monthly traded volume.\n6. Linear Finance & PieDAO will work together to promote the strength and institutional level research conducted by the PieDao team, the PieDao synthetic DeFi index on Binance Smart chain and any public blockchains that are used by Linear, the PieDao indexes on ETH Chain, and leverage respective communities to spread awareness of each ecosystem.\n7. Linear Finance will commit marketing resources and dollars to spread awareness and promotion on all social media platforms and relevant media/PR agencies.\n8. Linear Finance will commit to working together with PieDao on bringing other synthetic versions of PieDao’s assets (such as the NFT index). Looking forward; as more traditional and exotic assets are to be listed on Linear.Exchange in the upcoming months the team at Linear Finance welcome and support PieDAO to bake creative Pies out of its synthetics.\n\nNOTE: In case of acceptance, a Technology Agreement will be made that stipulates the terms and conditions in detail.\n\nFull proposal available at https://forum.piedao.org/t/linear-finance-x-piedao-partnership-and-synthetic-pie-listing/841\n\n**This snapshot vote is intended to formalise support for the above proposal:**\n**- YES votes in favour of the above**\n**- NO declines the proposal**\n\n",

      "title": "Proposal: Market Making Proposal from Wintermute Trading",
      "content": "Summary/Abstract:\n\nThis proposal is published for presenting the terms of $DOUGH market-making services to the PieDAO community and approving it:\n\nAuthorize Wintermute Trading as official $DOUGH market-maker\nTransfer 1.5% of DOUGH supply (1.5 million $DOUGH) to the Community treasury for market-making purposes as a loan to the Wintermute Trading. Wintermute Trading will have to return either the full loan amount or 3 million USDC (~50% premium to current price) in 1 year\nWintermute will commit to maintain inventory in PIEs upon them being listed on any Tier 1 exchange. The amount invested will be 10% of AuM up to a total of $20 mln\n\nWintermute basic background\n\nWintermute was founded in July 2017 by three Optiver veterans. Evgeny Gaevoy, founder and CEO, was previously head of ETFs (screen and OTC) at Optiver Europe, one of the largest ETF market making desks.\n\nWintermute’s trading volume in 2H 2020 surpassed $70B and their average daily trading volumes in 2021 are over $2B\n\nWintermute is backed by Lightspeed Venture Partners, Pantera, Blockchain.com Ventures and others\n\nWintermute Trading is registered with FCA for our OTC business\n\nWintermute PieDAO specific background\n\nWintermute believes index products will be one of the key themes in 2021 and as a result is looking to back several teams in the space with an ultimate goal of:\n\nListing the index products on key cefi exchanges and facilitating liquid markets on these products and their derivatives (starting with perpetuals, following with options)\nCombined total AuM of index products exceeding $25B by end of 2021\nWintermute believes the key issue with these products not being adopted outside of defi is lack of market making support as market makers and exchanges are not looking to support/list them because of low AuM, while the AuM stays low because there is not enough adoption/interest outside of defi. Wintermute wants to lead that adoption by committing a significant part of it’s resources and at the same time getting exposure to leading teams by becoming the official MM in protocol tokens and direct investment. Wintermute expects to be active in governance matters.\n\nSpecifically for PieDAO community Wintermute commits to:\n\nProvide liquid markets across all tier 1 cefi exchanges (and a handful of 2nd tier as well)\nProactively support listing of $DOUGH on key western exchanges\nSupport a number of flagship PIEs towards cefi and defi listings\nIn particular, once PIEs are launched on tier 1 exchange, Wintermute commits to hold 10% of the AuM for market making purposes with a minimum of $0.5 mln per PIE, up to $20 mln in total for all listed PIEs\nAsk :\n\nWe would like to request the PieDAO community to pass a proposal to approve the transfer of up to 1.5% of the total token supply of $DOUGH for Market Making services of $DOUGH on key centralized exchanges.\n\nWe propose to PieDAO Community appointing a third party agent (Wintermute Trading) to act as the PieDAO Community Agent to market-make $DOUGH across cefi, defi and OTC\n\nTo facilitate the work of the Community Agent on the community’s behalf, we propose to authorize operational actions required to effectuate the market making, including release of up to 1.5M $DOUGH to the Community Agent from the PieDAO Token Supply for liquidity provisioning.\n\nA Yes vote for this proposal would accomplish the following :\n\nApproval of the above terms to enable the Community Agent to proceed with creating and transferring 1.5% of the total $DOUGH token supply from the community token allocation, where the proceeds will be directed towards market making.\nThe loan will be returned in 1 year, in Apr 2022 in tokens or in DAI/USDT/USDC equivalent at a price of $2 per token\nA No vote would result in rejection of these terms",

Through these talks we've added:\n- [Punk-Basic](https://gallery.nftx.org/funds/punk-basic/) (Floor fund for CryptoPunks)\n- [Mask](https://gallery.nftx.org/funds/mask/) (Floor fund of Hashmasks)\n- NFTX (Governance token of NFTX)\n- Rari (Governance token of Rarible)\n- SOCKS (The OG dynamically priced limited edition socks)\n\nWith this collaborative proposal, the goal is to make the best and broadest NFT index currently in the market. By expanding the scope of the PLAY to provide full exposure to all the different sectors of the NFT world by including infrastructure, collectibles, and art into the existing (original) allocation. \n\n#### Collaboration\n\nA collaboration between PieDAO and NFTX for launching the PLAY fund would mean:\n\n- PLAY will include floor funds created by NFTX, starting with what’s available today and adding more along the way once liquid enough (there are many additional funds, such as one for Autoglyphs, launching soon).\n- NFTX will keep creating liquid markets for NFTX/fund on SushiSwap, allowing PLAY to be easily mintable.\n- PieDAO will create liquid markets for DOUGH/PLAY.\n- PieDAO & NFTX will work together to promote PLAY.\n\n#### Composition\n\nMANA: 18.53%\nENJ: 18.53%\nSAND: 12.28%\nUOS: 10.05%\nRFOX: 9.06%\nAXS: 8.23%\nNFTX: 6.40%\nRARI: 4.42%\nATRI: 4.31%\nGHST: 3.53%\nSOCKS: 1.68%\nMUST: 1.18%\nPUNK-BASIC: 0.90%\nMASK: 0.90%",

      "content": "The question is: Should we do it ?\n\nFull discussion here: https://forum.piedao.org/t/ge1-open-day-at-the-bakery/359/34\n\n**GE Name:** Open day at the bakery\n\n**Time frame** : 3 weeks\n\n**Hypothesis:** We will reach a lot of people, and people will discover PieDAO or use it more.\n\n**Description**: Create a series of contests on Twitter .\n\n3 weeks = 3 contests. So 1 contest / week\n\nEach week has a topic:\n\nWeek 1=  DOUGH\nWeek 2 = PieVaults\nWeek 3 = Oven\n\nUsers must Like / Follow / RT\n\n**Metrics**: Number of new followers , number of likes, number of RT. Number of people joining the discord. We can hope +/- 10%. So around 600 and 800 new followers would be considered as a succes.\n\n**Definition of success**: see above. And more generally it will bring more awareness in the community. Other indexes have very agressive marketing , so it’s important to stay visible.\n\n**Resources**: 3 x $100 BCP\n\nIt’s not a lot for the DAO but I can be very impactful.\n\n**To go Further**: It will also help to collect some metrics to see what works and what needs to be improved for future campaigns.

      "content": "**Summary**\nIntroduce a 60k $DOUGH reward (total over 3 weeks) for LPs to the YPIE/ETH pool on Uniswap V2, starting from January 29th, 4pm UTC. \n\n**Motivation**\nPieDAO is entering the growth phase of its journey to bring financial empowerment to everyone on the planet. As part of our initiatives to bring Pies in the hands of as many users as possible, we would love to introduce $YPIE Liquidity Rewards.\n\n**$YPIE** is the first PieVault from PieDAO, a boundary-pushing new product line that combines the convenience of a passively held, diversified basket of assets with automated active strategies to generate the highest possible returns.\n\nEach PieVault includes a carefully curated, balanced portfolio of crypto assets that are **intrinsically productive**: yield-maximising strategies (e.g. staking, lending, yield farming) are applied to each individual asset automatically. This asset appreciation is reflected in the price of the PieVault, constantly growing as the underlying tokens generate yield.\n\nIn addition, PieVaults benefit from a much more **secure architecture** than traditional smart pools, while also not being subject to AMM risk.\n\nFinally, and a significant milestone for the DeFi ecosystem, all tokens within PieVaults that have governance power are delegated, and will be **meta-governed** by $DOUGH holders, significantly reducing the barrier to entry for governance participation. \n\nThis new liquidity program would be an initial trial run lasting for 21 days. In the future we are looking forward to continuing to work closely with Sushiswap, including the possibility of double yield via the Onsen program.\n\nNOTE:\nIn order to maintain the current reward cap to 150K DOUGH/week in total, it's here proposed to reduce by 20k DOUGH/week the current incentive programs, specifically:\n- DOUGH/ETH pool, from current 80K DOUGH/week, to 70K DOUGH/week;\n- BCP pool, from current 30K DOUGH/week, to 20K DOUGH/week\n\n**Specification**\nTotal reward: **60k DOUGH** (total over 3 weeks)\nProgram initial duration: **3 weeks**, starting from Jan 29th, 5pm UTC\nIncentivised pool: **$YPIE/$ETH on Uniswap V2**, to be established\nRewards liquidity: **20% liquid, 80% escrowed** over 52weeks",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis PIP proposes the allocation of a 6-months forecasted budget to PieDAO's multisig, to enable a higher responsiveness and authonomy over basic operational expenditures. \n\n# Abstract\nThis PIP would allow the Multisig to make budgetary decisions according to the proposed 6 months budget forecast. This power could be removed or revised as per governance decision.\n\n# Motivation\nAs PieDAO evolves, so does the need to cover operational expenses more responsively, enabling a quicker reaction of this growing organisation to the changing DeFi environment.\nPieDAO is still in his infancy as a project, at lot has been done with very limited resources ( *2devs + 1 analyst* ): going forward it will be crucial to set the conditions to make rapid decisions in order to establish a stronger foundation for growth.\n\nWe need DAO contributors to be empowered to act quickly and decisively with regard to all activities aimed at further streamline PieDAO' success and get rewarded for it. This proposal formalizes a sort of delegation of administrative roles from a strict expenditure perspective, that will serve as a base layer for the organization.\n\n## Specification\nThe budget below forecasts the planned expenditures over 6 months within the 4 domains considered: Security, Grants, Ops. Expenses & Community management.\n\n![budget|636x466](https://forum.piedao.org/uploads/default/original/1X/4e555a58d5baa9a8169c470e2ab5546b035e3c06.png) \n\nExpenditures and balance will be documented and reported ahead of 6-months closure, in preparation for the following 6 months’ budgeting exercise. In this sense, the above budget will serve both as a baseline for the monitoring of ongoing expenses variance, and as a driver for the computation of productivity metrics of the organisation. \n\n### Overview\n\nThis proposal grants the Multisig operational authority on the following decisions for the next six (6) months from implementation:\n\n* Determining and distributing protocol grants.\n* Determining and distributing community grants.\n* Facilitating business development and integrations.\n* Identifying and engaging analytical firms.\n* Determining and distributing legal + DAO consultation grants.\n* Identifying and executing key hires.\n* Engaging security firms.\n* Continue executing costs related to infra and smartcontracts like the Oven.\n* Hire UI & front-end development.\n\nThis proposal does NOT grant the Multisig:\n\n* Authority over the DOUGH token or emissions.\n* Authority over the Pie rebalancing.\n* The power to ignore any approved PIPs or the governance process in general.\n* The power to create a legal entity.\n* Leadership powers beyond those described above.\n* Any powers over the PIP process or governance.\n* Authority over the composition of the Multisig group.\n\nThis PIP was inspired by the approach took by Yearn Finance to effectively streamline their operations, which we consider a successful case within the DeFi space.",

      "content": "\n### **Summary**\nThis proposal suggests a concrete first step to the [[RFC] Incentivizing DOUGH Holding, Staking &amp; Revenues](https://forum.piedao.org/t/rfc-incentivizing-dough-holding-staking-revenues/227) by introducing a streaming fee of **0.7%** to DEFI+S and DEFI+L.\n\nThe scope of this proposal **excludes** how fees are going to be used, instead, it keeps it simple by proposing all the fees accumulates into the DAO Vault already deployed for this purpose `0xaf2fe0d4fe879066b2baa68d9e56cc375df22815`.\n\n### Motivation\nThe introduction of fees it's a mandatory step to capture value from the Pies and funnel that to $DOUGH token holders. The proposed value of 0.7% is competitive compare to alternative indexes like DPI, it's within ranges of the traditional investment industry.\n\nFor reference, based on Morningstar's research, the average expense ratio for a small-cap fund is 1.61% instead the average large-cap fund has an expense ratio of 1.45%.\n\n**What are streaming fees?** \nThe streaming fees are paid out to the DAO linearly over time based on the entire market cap of the Pie (ie: 0.7% of market cap over 1 year). The streaming fee is calculated linearly and can be claimed by anyone, anytime by calling the appropriate function in the Pie smart contract.\n\nThe current implementation of PieSmartPools already includes all the necessary code to activate such fees, with no code change involved.\n\n**Which Pies are fees proposed for?** \nAt the time of writing, the proposal for fees is only related to DEFI+L and DEFI+S. The same fee structure can be applied to future DEFI Pies according to governance.\n\n**Why not DEFI++?** \nBy only introducing fees to the underlying of DEFI++ (DEFI+L / DEFI+S 70/30) there is no need to add additional fees to DEFI++ itself.\n\n### Closing notes\nThe sooner we enable the protocol to capture value, the stronger the incentives for DOUGH token holders to actively participate in the growth of the protocol.\n\n![](upload://iaE5Hp2KtLxr1NIoi8ERwYP0WCf.png)",
