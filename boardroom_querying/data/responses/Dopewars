      "content": "GM Hustlers\n\nMassive news afoot. We have submitted a grant proposal schedule to the Starknet Foundation with a number of phased requests for funding support alongside specified milestones and delivery.\n\nI am happy to report that the Foundation has approved funding to support Phase 1 as described below. The Foundation will continue to evaluate our progress and the position of our other requests. Overall we are aiming to secure funding to incentivise & market the migration, cover the costs for our L3 Network Paper Chain to settle on SN and ultimately secure a Developer Incentive Grant to promote building within Dope World.\n\n-\\* Phase 1 “Migrateˮ: Migrate DW Primitives to Starknet\\*\n\\- Description: Currently these are all deployed on Optimism. The process will entail recreating existing Optimism-based Dope Wars NFT infrastructure on Starknet.\n\nThe Foundation has awarded us a grant of 200k STRK that we intend to put toward this purpose as soon as we can. Currently we are underway with the administration to process this grant.\n\n*Delivery for Phase 1 plus extras.*\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to authorise Dope Labs to administer the Migration to Starknet, plus the extra jobs detailed below, using both the allocated STRK and the 90k USDC raised from the OTC purchase by 1kx. Our intention is to conduct a REGENESIS of the ecosystem at this juncture. We have an opportunity to refresh a number of issues that have been lacking and form the basis whereby we can position ourselves as a leading Gaming Autonomous World on Starknet attracting developers and further Foundation funding. To do this we will begin by attacking the issues that offer the greatest upside at the least technical difficulty and expense based resistance.\n\nDope Labs will work in conjunction with Cartridge to plan and implement the following tasks. Where applicable Cartridge will put together scope of work documents, help to recruit suitable developers and proof work. The tasks will be as follows and will be conducted in parallel.\n\n1. Create a bridge from L1 that enables the unbundling of L1 DOPE onto Starknet. This task is technically much easier than creating the bridge from Optimism to SN and we can lean on existing OS infrastructure. The gear items on Optimism will be left for now, but the OGs will be ported to SN. The primary purpose of unbundling L1 DOPEs to SN will be to allow us to spend our resources wisely in order to begin to integrate hustlers/gear into Dope Wars & Dope World experiences.\n2. Migrate and rebuild the existing frontend to Starknet including indexing infrastructure and Hustler configuration tooling. The market place function will be excluded at this time as it is a very costly function and we believe it is better to lean on existing market places at this time.\n3. Re-brand our ecosystem to Dope World and rebuild our Website on DopeWorld.gg. This will tie us in with the narrative developments described here: [https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xfefee96a321ccc218d26c9f913bbd24cf2d733c801d030e863362b45388d207d](https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xfefee96a321ccc218d26c9f913bbd24cf2d733c801d030e863362b45388d207d)\n4. During the process of migrating our assets to Starknet, we will take the opportunity to clean up some potential IP issues that have been outstanding as well as some of the more objectionable names as we reposition ourselves as Dope World. An assessment of the locality based groupings will be conducted to best ensure that they make sense for game play.\n5. The long game will see us conduct a governance move to L2 Starknet. L1 governance is not a viable option cost wise for our ecosystem. The exact composition of this will be a work in progress.\n6. This proposal will amend DIP-87 Layers of Dope in the detail that our Layer 3 Paper Chain will be settled onto Starknet.\n\nThis REGENISIS comprises of a number of tasks that together will refresh our position and take us back to the bleeding edge where we belong. This opportunity has been a long time coming and is thanks to the many that have kept believing and building. A vote yes will authorise Dope Labs to utilise the STRK grant and the 90k USDC to achieve this objective using only as much funds as required.\n\nTani",

Its was a bit of a fast ball but essentially the Stark promotional team have been super keen to keep the ball rolling since EthCC and develop momentum with KBW as we progress towards DEVCON, so they were being proactive in looking for people to attend.\n\nWe had two Members put their hand up to represent - big thanks to Ethercorn and Jay from UnixLabs for offering their time to attend. Their role was to help manage the SN booth chatting about DopeWars and SN Gaming. They had a meeting prior with the Cartridge Crew to discuss details and gather all the info required for the job. We had a discussion amongst key Members and DAO SN Gaming stakeholders around any potential optic issues given they have been developing Means Streets. It was concluded that they are capable to represent the DAO to fulfil the role and that they have an interesting and valuable perspective to talk from as the game developers and creators for Mean Streets. They did their homework and represented Dope DAO well.\n\nThe cost to the DAO to represent at KBW was only $1000 USD towards costs for flights and accommodation and a small merch budget.\n\nBreakdown being:\n\nFlights  $420\n\nAccommodation $365\n\nMerch  $215\n\nThis was very good value for money to have DopeWars represented at KBW and has gone a long way in continuing to develop the relationship between Dope DAO and the Starknet Foundation. The funds utilised will be from the pool of ETH we have in the DopeLabs Multi-Sig 0x90103beDCfbE1eeE44ded89cEd88bA8503580b3D. The funds will be released to Cyberbitz who has already covered expenses in order to capture the cheaper flights and accom. So this is a vote to pay him back.\n\nFor your consideration.\n\nTani",

      "content": "GM Dope DAO\n\nWe had an opportunity for us to get some subsidized support for Members of Dope DAO to attend Korean Blockchain Week (KBW) and represent both DopeWars and Starknet Gaming.  Its was a bit of a fast ball but essentially the Stark promotional team have been super keen to keep the ball rolling since EthCC and develop momentum with KBW as we progress towards DEVCON, so they were being proactive in looking for people to attend. \n\nWe had two Members put their hand up to represent - big thanks to Ethercorn and Jay from UnixLabs for offering their time to attend. Their role was to help manage the SN booth chatting about DopeWars and SN Gaming. They had a meeting prior with the Cartridge Crew to discuss details and gather all the info required for the job. We had a discussion amongst key Members and DAO SN Gaming stakeholders around any potential optic issues given they have been developing Means Streets. It was concluded that they are capable to represent the DAO to fulfil the role and that they have an interesting and valuable perspective to talk from as the game developers and creators for Mean Streets. They did their homework and represented Dope DAO well. \n\nThe cost to the DAO to represent at KBW was only $1000 USD towards costs for flights and accommodation and a small merch budget.\n\nBreakdown being:\n\nFlights  $420\n\nAccommodation $365\n\nMerch  $215\n\nThis was very good value for money to have DopeWars represented at KBW and has gone a long way in continuing to develop the relationship between Dope DAO and the Starknet Foundation. The funds utilised will be from the pool of ETH we have in the DopeLabs Multi-Sig 0x90103beDCfbE1eeE44ded89cEd88bA8503580b3D. The funds will be released to Cyberbitz who has already covered expenses in order to capture the cheaper flights and accom. So this is a vote to pay him back.\n\nFor your consideration.\n\nTani",

      "content": "GM Hustlers\n\nMassive news afoot. We have submitted a grant proposal schedule to the Starknet Foundation with a number of phased requests for funding support alongside specified milestones and delivery.\n\nI am happy to report that the Foundation has approved funding to support Phase 1 as described below. The Foundation will continue to evaluate our progress and the position of our other requests. Overall we are aiming to secure funding to incentivise & market the migration, cover the costs for our L3 Network Paper Chain to settle on SN and ultimately secure a Developer Incentive Grant to promote building within Dope World.\n\n-\\* Phase 1 “Migrateˮ: Migrate DW Primitives to Starknet\\*\n\\- Description: Currently these are all deployed on Optimism. The process will entail recreating existing Optimism-based Dope Wars NFT infrastructure on Starknet.\n\nThe Foundation has awarded us a grant of 200k STRK that we intend to put toward this purpose as soon as we can. Currently we are underway with the administration to process this grant.\n\n*Delivery for Phase 1 plus extras.*\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to authorise Dope Labs to administer the Migration to Starknet, plus the extra jobs detailed below, using both the allocated STRK and the 90k USDC raised from the OTC purchase by 1kx. Our intention is to conduct a REGENESIS of the ecosystem at this juncture. We have an opportunity to refresh a number of issues that have been lacking and form the basis whereby we can position ourselves as a leading Gaming Autonomous World on Starknet attracting developers and further Foundation funding. To do this we will begin by attacking the issues that offer the greatest upside at the least technical difficulty and expense based resistance.\n\nDope Labs will work in conjunction with Cartridge to plan and implement the following tasks. Where applicable Cartridge will put together scope of work documents, help to recruit suitable developers and proof work. The tasks will be as follows and will be conducted in parallel.\n\n1. Create a bridge from L1 that enables the unbundling of L1 DOPE onto Starknet. This task is technically much easier than creating the bridge from Optimism to SN and we can lean on existing OS infrastructure. The gear items on Optimism will be left for now, but the OGs will be ported to SN. The primary purpose of unbundling L1 DOPEs to SN will be to allow us to spend our resources wisely in order to begin to integrate hustlers/gear into Dope Wars & Dope World experiences.\n2. Migrate and rebuild the existing frontend to Starknet including indexing infrastructure and Hustler configuration tooling. The market place function will be excluded at this time as it is a very costly function and we believe it is better to lean on existing market places at this time.\n3. Re-brand our ecosystem to Dope World and rebuild our Website on DopeWorld.gg. This will tie us in with the narrative developments described here: [https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xfefee96a321ccc218d26c9f913bbd24cf2d733c801d030e863362b45388d207d](https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xfefee96a321ccc218d26c9f913bbd24cf2d733c801d030e863362b45388d207d)\n4. During the process of migrating our assets to Starknet, we will take the opportunity to clean up some potential IP issues that have been outstanding as well as some of the more objectionable names as we reposition ourselves as Dope World. An assessment of the locality based groupings will be conducted to best ensure that they make sense for game play.\n5. The long game will see us conduct a governance move to L2 Starknet. L1 governance is not a viable option cost wise for our ecosystem. The exact composition of this will be a work in progress.\n6. This proposal will amend DIP-87 Layers of Dope in the detail that our Layer 3 Paper Chain will be settled onto Starknet.\n\nThis REGENISIS comprises of a number of tasks that together will refresh our position and take us back to the bleeding edge where we belong. This opportunity has been a long time coming and is thanks to the many that have kept believing and building. A vote yes will authorise Dope Labs to utilise the STRK grant and the 90k USDC to achieve this objective using only as much funds as required.\n\nTani",

      "title": "DIP-79(c) Mean Streets MVP Enhancement Proposal",
      "content": "Overview\n\nAfter completing the deliveries in DIP-79 and conducting the early testing phase, we received extensive feedback and additional feature enhancement requests via Discord and the Mean Streets Service Portal. We have gathered and filtered this feedback to identify what can be addressed in time for the public release and the Coin Telegraph Article feature. This proposal outlines the technical and graphical enhancements designed to address current player feedback, optimize performance, and enhance user engagement, ensuring the game is in its best shape before the public release.\n\nScope of Work\n\n2.1. Graphical Enhancements\nCharacter Animation Outlines:\nIntegrate black outlines into all character animation sprite sheets to harmonize with the provided outlined map elements, ensuring a unified visual style throughout the game.\nRedesign the character selection avatars to include black outlines.\n\nCrosshair Aiming Aid Graphics\nEnhance shooting accuracy.\nDesign crosshair styles to accommodate different weapons and gameplay styles.\nEnsure that the crosshair designs align with the overall aesthetic and thematic elements of the game.\n\nWeapon Holding Postures\nEnsure accurate representation of weapon handling.\nRedesign weapon holding animations for a range of weapon types.\nEnsure precise hand orientation that aligns with the mouse cursor movement.\n\n2.2. Technical Enhancements:\n(Implement for WebGL and PC)\nMap Resizing\nDecreasing the size of the map reduces downtime and encourages more frequent encounters between players, resulting in faster-paced and more intense gameplay sessions.\nDivide the current map into three distinct mini-maps, each with its own unique theme\n\nRespawn Spot Adjustment\nEnsure strategic, fair, and balanced gameplay.\nAdjust the respawn spots in accordance with the layout and features of the new smaller maps. Ensure that respawn points are strategically placed to provide fair and balanced respawn opportunities for players across all maps and all modes.\nImplement a short-term buff such as \"spawn protection\" where players are invulnerable for a brief period\n\nCrosshair Aiming Aid\nEnhance shooting accuracy.\nDevelop a crosshair enhancement feature that adjusts based on weapon type and player movement.\n\nOn-hover Effect for Buttons\nEnhance user interface interactivity and visual feedback.\nDesign and implement dynamic on-hover effects for UI buttons, such as scaling up on hover and scaling down when deselected, complemented by a glow effect to visually indicate interactivity.\n\nStep-by-Step Interactive Gameplay Guide\nImprove new player onboarding by providing a clear, interactive guide to game mechanics.\nDevelop an interactive step-by-step guide that introduces game UI elements and mechanics one at a time, enhancing user understanding and engagement.\n\nFull-Screen Launch Option\nImprove first impressions and enhance user engagement by launching the game in full-screen mode by default.\nConfigure the Unity settings to enable the game to launch directly in full-screen mode for the WebGL platform.\n\nImplement Automatic Transaction Gas Estimation\nMinimize risk of transaction failures during peak times.\nDevelop a system to calculate and suggest gas fees based on current network conditions.\n\nAutomated Build and Deployment System\nImplement a fully automated build and deployment system using Unity Cloud’s auto-build feature to streamline updates and eliminate manual build times.\n\nAnimation Adjustments\nImplement the newly updated hustler character postures to reflect more dynamic and realistic movements:\nApply outlines on all in-game hustler characters to sync with the default map design, adjust arm movement while holding weapons\nAdjust timing and reactions of characters when hit by vehicles or gunfire to eliminate noticeable delays.\n\nDeliverables\n\nFully integrated and operational game builds for WebGL and PC, incorporating all the specified technical and graphical enhancements.\nDeployment of full-screen launch functionality, advanced respawn systems, on-hover UI effects, automatic gas estimation, crosshair aiming aid, and step-by-step interactive gameplay guides.\nUpdated character animations and weapon postures with added black outlines, aligned with the new aesthetic requirements.\n\nAcceptance \n\nAll technical enhancements such as the full-screen launch option, advanced respawn systems, on-hover effects, automatic gas estimation, and crosshair aiming aid are implemented according to the specifications.\nUnity Build Automation is fully set up and operational, significantly reducing manual build times as detailed.\nAll character animations and weapon postures are redesigned and implemented with the required black outlines.\nThe character selection screen avatars are updated and consistent with the game’s graphical style.\nEnhanced game builds must demonstrate improved gameplay fluidity, reduced downtime, and increased player encounters due to map resizing.\nThe game must exhibit enhanced shooting accuracy as a result of the crosshair aiming aid.\nThe automated gas estimation system functions reliably across different network conditions without failure.\n\nResources\n\n5.1.

      "content": "GM Hustlers\n\nMassive news afoot. We have submitted a grant proposal schedule to the Starknet Foundation with a number of phased requests for funding support alongside specified milestones and delivery.\n\nI am happy to report that the Foundation has approved funding to support Phase 1 as described below. The Foundation will continue to evaluate our progress and the position of our other requests. Overall we are aiming to secure funding to incentivise & market the migration, cover the costs for our L3 Network Paper Chain to settle on SN and ultimately secure a Developer Incentive Grant to promote building within Dope World.\n\n-* Phase 1 “Migrateˮ: Migrate DW Primitives to Starknet*\n    - Description: Currently these are all deployed on Optimism. The process will entail recreating existing Optimism-based Dope Wars NFT infrastructure on Starknet.\n\nThe Foundation has awarded us a grant of 200k STRK that we intend to put toward this purpose as soon as we can. Currently we are underway with the administration to process this grant.\n\n*Delivery for Phase 1 plus extras.*\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to authorise Dope Labs to administer the Migration to Starknet, plus the extra jobs detailed below, using both the allocated STRK and the 90k USDC raised from the OTC purchase by 1kx. Our intention is to conduct a REGENESIS of the ecosystem at this juncture. We have an opportunity to refresh a number of issues that have been lacking and form the basis whereby we can position ourselves as a leading Gaming Autonomous World on Starknet attracting developers and further Foundation funding. To do this we will begin by attacking the issues that offer the greatest upside at the least technical difficulty and expense based resistance.\n\nDope Labs will work in conjunction with Cartridge to plan and implement the following tasks. Where applicable Cartridge will put together scope of work documents, help to recruit suitable developers and proof work. The tasks will be as follows and will be conducted in parallel. \n\n1. Create a bridge from L1 that enables the unbundling of L1 DOPE onto Starknet. This task is technically much easier than creating the bridge from Optimism to SN and we can lean on existing OS infrastructure. The gear items on Optimism will be left for now, but the OGs will be ported to SN. The primary purpose of unbundling L1 DOPEs to SN will be to allow us to spend our resources wisely in order to begin to integrate hustlers/gear into Dope Wars & Dope World experiences.\n2. Migrate and rebuild the existing frontend to Starknet including indexing infrastructure and Hustler configuration tooling. The market place function will be excluded at this time as it is a very costly function and we believe it is better to lean on existing market places at this time.\n3. Re-brand our ecosystem to Dope World and rebuild our Website on DopeWorld.gg. This will tie us in with the narrative developments described here: https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xfefee96a321ccc218d26c9f913bbd24cf2d733c801d030e863362b45388d207d\n4. During the process of migrating our assets to Starknet, we will take the opportunity to clean up some potential IP issues that have been outstanding as well as some of the more objectionable names as we reposition ourselves as Dope World. An assessment of the locality based groupings will be conducted to best ensure that they make sense for game play. \n5. The long game will see us conduct a governance move to L2 Starknet. L1 governance is not a viable option cost wise for our ecosystem. The exact composition of this will be a work in progress. \n6. This proposal will amend DIP-87 Layers of Dope in the detail that our Layer 3 Paper Chain will be settled onto Starknet. \n\nThis REGENISIS comprises of a number of tasks that together will refresh our position and take us back to the bleeding edge where we belong. This opportunity has been a long time coming and is thanks to the many that have kept believing and building. A vote yes will authorise Dope Labs to utilise the STRK grant and the 90k USDC to achieve this objective using only as much funds as required. \n\nTani",

      "content": "See below the copy of the Snapshot Proposal.\n\nThe Snapshot vote results were:\n\n10% - 803 DOPES 97.93%\n\n5% - 16 DOPES 1.95%\n\n7.5% - 1 DOPE 0.12%\n\nTani\n\n\n\nGM Dope DAO\n\nWith deployment of RYO on Starknet imminent, we need to reach consensus on an appropriate fee structure for the game.\n\nThe first major question would normally be; What percentage will Cartridge take and what percentage will be allocated toward Dope DAO efforts as per the Operating Agreement Social Contract. However, the Cartridge team being absolute CHADS! They have decided that for this first iteration of RYO to be deployed on SN Mainnet, they will not take any cut at all! So all the proceeds can be driven toward implementing the best solution for the DopeWars ecosystem.\n\nSo the next question is what should that look like? Without having Cartridge take a slice there only remains two parties that need to be considered; Dope DAO Treasury and the Gamers themselves. The overall thrust of this proposal leans towards the outcome that the structure should be set up to favour the Gamers. This is in line with best advice from Cartridge and agreed sentiment of DopeLabs. The reason being that we should concentrate on adoption, growth and positive participant experience at the outset while the ecosystem (DopeWorld) is in its infancy. The here are a number of relevant factors. Lets discuss them below:\n\n**Social Contract**\n\nWe think it is important that the precedent is set that Dope DAO treasury takes at least a small portion to create that feedback loop. We have the OA Social Contract guiding principle that the minimum feedback according to the Social Contract is set at 5%.\n\n**Option A:**\n\nDope DAO Treasury takes 5% $Paper.\n\n**Option B:**\n\nDope DAO Treasury takes 7.5% $Paper.\n\n**Option C:**\n\nDope DAO Treasury takes 10% $Paper.\n\n**Entry Fee to Play:**\n\nThe entry fee to play will initially be set at 1000 $Paper per round. This amount will be adjustable to account for fluctuations in $Paper value and can also be amended in the future if deemed appropriate.\n\n*Initially it will not be included but Cartridge may look to implement a function whereby the client takes a hardcoded cut of the entry fee in order to incentivize builders to make their own version of the game.*\n\n**Game Rewards/Prizes:**\n\nAfter the DAO slice, the remaining 90%-95% of the entry fees will be dispersed to Gamers as Game Rewards. As a guiding principle, Cartridge will maintain the right and flexibility to explicitly test different formats in consultation with the DAO and Gamers. This will allow us all together to test, adjust and work toward and optimal solution that Cartridge can implement with practical sensibility.\n\nInitially though, the leadership board as it has been developed in play testing will remain and it will be payed out on the following basis:\n\n1st Place 60%\n\n2nd Place 30%\n\n3rd Place 10%\n\nThe leaderboard will be paid out and reset every 7 days.\n\n**Note**\n\nThis fee structure is specific only to L2 mainnet, it may change for L3.\n\nThis proposal will endorse the abovementioned parameters and vote upon the ratio for return to DAO vs the amount returned to Gamers through Game Rewards.\n\nVote\n\nOption A: 5% DAO\n\nOption B: 7.5% DAO\n\nOption C: 10% DAO\n\nFor your consideration\n\nTani",

However, the Cartridge team being absolute CHADS! They have decided that for this first iteration of RYO to be deployed on SN Mainnet, they will not take any cut at all! So all the proceeds can be driven toward implementing the best solution for the DopeWars ecosystem.\n\nSo the next question is what should that look like? Without having Cartridge take a slice there only remains two parties that need to be considered; Dope DAO Treasury and the Gamers themselves. The overall thrust of this proposal leans towards the outcome that the structure should be set up to favour the Gamers. This is in line with best advice from Cartridge and agreed sentiment of DopeLabs. The reason being that we should concentrate on adoption, growth and positive participant experience at the outset while the ecosystem (DopeWorld) is in its infancy. The here are a number of relevant factors. Lets discuss them below:\n\n**Social Contract**\n\nWe think it is important that the precedent is set that Dope DAO treasury takes at least a small portion to create that feedback loop. We have the OA Social Contract guiding principle that the minimum feedback according to the Social Contract is set at 5%.\n\n**Option A:**\n\nDope DAO Treasury takes 5% $Paper.\n\n**Option B:**\n\nDope DAO Treasury takes 7.5% $Paper.\n\n**Option C:**\n\nDope DAO Treasury takes 10% $Paper.\n\n**Entry Fee to Play:**\n\nThe entry fee to play will initially be set at 1000 $Paper per round. This amount will be adjustable to account for fluctuations in $Paper value and can also be amended in the future if deemed appropriate.\n\n*Initially it will not be included but Cartridge may look to implement a function whereby the client takes a hardcoded cut of the entry fee in order to incentivize builders to make their own version of the game.*\n\n**Game Rewards/Prizes:**\n\nAfter the DAO slice, the remaining 90%-95% of the entry fees will be dispersed to Gamers as Game Rewards. As a guiding principle, Cartridge will maintain the right and flexibility to explicitly test different formats in consultation with the DAO and Gamers. This will allow us all together to test, adjust and work toward and optimal solution that Cartridge can implement with practical sensibility.\n\nInitially though, the leadership board as it has been developed in play testing will remain and it will be payed out on the following basis:\n\n1st Place 60%\n\n2nd Place 30%\n\n3rd Place 10%\n\nThe leaderboard will be paid out and reset every 7 days.\n\n**Note**\n\nThis fee structure is specific only to L2 mainnet, it may change for L3.\n\nThis proposal will endorse the abovementioned parameters and vote upon the ratio for return to DAO vs the amount returned to Gamers through Game Rewards.\n\nVote\n\nOption A: 5% DAO\n\nOption B: 7.5% DAO\n\nOption C: 10% DAO\n\nFor your consideration\n\nTani",

      "title": "DIP - 84 RYO Fee Structure",
      "content": "GM Dope DAO\n\nWith deployment of RYO on Starknet imminent, we need to reach consensus on an appropriate fee structure for the game. \n\nThe first major question would normally be; What percentage will Cartridge take and what percentage will be allocated toward Dope DAO efforts as per the Operating Agreement Social Contract. However, the Cartridge team being absolute CHADS! They have decided that for this first iteration of RYO to be deployed on SN Mainnet, they will not take any cut at all! So all the proceeds can be driven toward implementing the best solution for the DopeWars ecosystem. \n\nSo the next question is what should that look like? Without having Cartridge take a slice there only remains two parties that need to be considered; Dope DAO Treasury and the Gamers themselves. The overall thrust of this proposal leans towards the outcome that the structure should be set up to favour the Gamers. This is in line with best advice from Cartridge and agreed sentiment of DopeLabs. The reason being that we should concentrate on adoption, growth and positive participant experience at the outset while the ecosystem (DopeWorld) is in its infancy. The here are a number of relevant factors. Lets discuss them below:\n\n**Social Contract**\n\nWe think it is important that the precedent is set that Dope DAO treasury takes at least a small portion to create that feedback loop. We have the OA Social Contract guiding principle that the minimum feedback according to the Social Contract is set at 5%. \n\n**Option A:** \n\nDope DAO Treasury takes 5% $Paper.\n\n**Option B:**\n\nDope DAO Treasury takes 7.5% $Paper.\n\n**Option C:**\n\nDope DAO Treasury takes 10% $Paper.\n\n**Entry Fee to Play:**\n\nThe entry fee to play will initially be set at 1000 $Paper per round. This amount will be adjustable to account for fluctuations in $Paper value and can also be amended in the future if deemed appropriate.\n\n*Initially it will not be included but Cartridge may look to implement a function whereby the client takes a hardcoded cut of the entry fee in order to incentivize builders to make their own version of the game.* \n\n**Game Rewards/Prizes:**\n\nAfter the DAO slice, the remaining 90%-95% of the entry fees will be dispersed to Gamers as Game Rewards. As a guiding principle, Cartridge will maintain the right and flexibility to explicitly test different formats in consultation with the DAO and Gamers. This will allow us all together to test, adjust and work toward and optimal solution that Cartridge can implement with practical sensibility.\n\nInitially though, the leadership board as it has been developed in play testing will remain and it will be payed out on the following basis:\n\n1st Place 60%\n\n2nd Place 30%\n\n3rd Place 10%\n\nThe leaderboard will be paid out and reset every 7 days.\n\n**Note**\n\nThis fee structure is specific only to L2 mainnet, it may change for L3.\n\nThis proposal will endorse the abovementioned parameters and vote upon the ratio for return to DAO vs the amount returned to Gamers through Game Rewards.\n\nVote \n\nOption A: 5% DAO\n\nOption B: 7.5% DAO\n\nOption C: 10% DAO\n\nFor your consideration\n\nTani",

      "content": "GM Dope DAO\n\nDopeLabs 3.0 is here again, this time we propose some adjustments to improve the practicality of the process.\n\nTimeframe: \n\nWe feel as though 6 month terms are still working well but we note that it can present difficulty when trying to manage Members availability to contribute. In order to give some level of flexibility, we propose that the term includes the ability to appoint new Members by unanimous DopeLabs decision if the need and opportunity arises. For example, we are currently trying hard to recruit an in-house Dev with Cairo and Dojo skills. If we are successful this would allow us to add such a person into DopeLabs without having to go through the whole DIP process. The same could be said if a current Member needs to step away for any reason, or if a Member cannot commit exactly at this point but hopes to be able to in a few months, these situations could be managed in a similar way. \n\nHours:\n\nThe flexible, scalable hours system works well but in some instances there are Members who have periods of higher intensity. The recent expansion of the Diffusion hours, specifically Richblks’ increase, will stay extant but we propose that all other positions will have the ability, if needed, to scale up to 60 hours per months to account for busy periods. We are anticipating an increased level of activity once we have games live later in the year. \n\nPositions:\n\nThe names below are incumbents who are prepared to continue. But of course this is the opportunity for any new Members willing and able, to contest such spots.\n\nDiffusion - Richblck, Cyber, Mrfax and M1.\n\nOperations - Spartan. Slasher is taking some time away from DopeLabs commitments at this time with the hope to possibly return in some capacity at a later time. \n\nProtocol - Tani and Sal continue alongside Mazzi who will remain as the lead administrator for Liquidity and Treasury. \n\nEngineers - Bort stays on and as mentioned above we are actively scouting for more Developer assistance. \n\nFunding:\n\nThis proposal will seek to top up the DopeLabs multisig by 5M $Paper.\n\nFor your consideration.\n\nTani",

      "title": "DIP - 89 Diffusion Team Expansion",
      "content": "As we have built momentum and consolidated development trajectory for DopeWars, work within the DopeLabs structure has highlighted some areas that I believe could be improved to increase our likelihood of success.\n\nThe current DopeLabs structure (availability to bill up to 30hrs per month) has been great for the early stages of project development because it has accommodated contributions in a flexible manner as the work environment has fleshed itself out. It was also useful for building through the bear because it was flexible in the sense that it could scale up and down during times of busy and quiet. It was also useful, and still is in many cases, because it accommodates contributors other commitments and allowed them to contribute valuably on a basis that suited their schedule.\nMoving forward we have identified an area within the Diffusion space that needs more commitment to achieve the desired results. The nature of this work is constant and the production of quality engagement is imperative for success. Richblck has been leading the DAO in this field doing fantastic work as we all can see. The feeling is that this output needs to be more organised and conducted with greater overall strategy and could therefore benefit from a more consolidated and reliable approach. The somewhat ad hoc current status of DopeLabs does not lend itself well toward allowing the level of commitment, from the contributor, that is required to achieve the desired result. People need a level of certainty before they can move away from other commitments in order to ‘pay the bills’. We also have the requirement to have more consistent engagements on Twitter, and other media platforms as we progress.\n\nThis proposal seeks to authorise the expansion of the DopeLabs Diffusion team. The goal is to enable deeper commitment and obtain better results. The details are as follows:\n\nDiffusion Team Lead:\n\nRichblck will occupy this position working on an engagement level equivalent to 8/10ths of what would be a normal annual working arrangement. This would mean he would increase his billable hours to a maximum of 128 hrs per month. This increased level of commitment would allow him to adopt a broader and more comprehensive position with regard to DopeWars promotion, including (but not limited to) the following tasks:\n\nOverall DopeWars marketing strategy.\nDevelopment of content.\nBrand development.\nAesthetic development\nPromotion platform development\nMessaging\n\nDiffusion Team \n\nThe Diffusion team that sits around the table with Rich would include existing team members Cyber + Mrfax and add in the original gangster M1. This effort requires a team to deliver best results and will mean that Rich can step back from the necessary day to day grind and focus on the bigger picture. Cyber, Mrfax and M1 would all stay at the current maximum billable hours of 30 hrs per month.\n\nThis team would assist Rich with the delivery including (but not limited to) the following tasks:\n\nRegular Twitter engagement\nPlatform development, expand follower base\nAssistance with content creation\nCollaboration opportunities with other projects\n\nThe total amount of hours billable for the entire (expanded) Diffusion team would add up to 218 hours per month. This translates to roughly the equivalent of 135% of what would be a single full time employment arrangement. But instead of getting 1.35 people we would get 4 amazing creative brains working on the promotion of DopeWars. I believe that this task is easily a full time job, given the relentless nature of it, and that the community and project would benefit greatly from the output that these four very talented hustlers could achieve. \n\nFor you consideration\n\nTani.",

      "title": "DIP-87: Layers of Dope",
      "content": "### Summary\n\nThe proposal focuses on deploying [Dope World](https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xfefee96a321ccc218d26c9f913bbd24cf2d733c801d030e863362b45388d207d) (DW) and [Roll Your Own](https://rollyourown.preview.cartridge.gg/) (RYO) as a Layer 3 (L3) application on top of the OP Mainnet. This proposal is an extension of [DIP-75: Dope World](https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xfefee96a321ccc218d26c9f913bbd24cf2d733c801d030e863362b45388d207d), the first version of RYO will still be deployed to Starknet in the short term according to the original proposal.\n\nThis extension will utilize [Cartridge Slot](https://cartridge.gg/blog/introducing-slot) with [Katana](https://book.dojoengine.org/toolchain/katana/overview.html) for execution, taking advantage of [zero-knowledge proofs (zkproofs) and fractal scaling](https://www.dojoengine.org/en/articles/provable-games/) to provide cheap, low latency, high throughput compute that will be settled on to OP Mainnet. The L3 network will use PAPER tokens for transaction fees. The proposal also includes the development of a bridge between Layer 2 (L2) and L3 for briding tokens and data between the networks.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\n**Layer 3 Deployment**: DW and RYO will be launched as an L3 application, leveraging the scalability and efficiency of Dojo and Cartridge Slot. The exact scaling architecture is still being defined, there will likely be a persistent [Dope World](https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xfefee96a321ccc218d26c9f913bbd24cf2d733c801d030e863362b45388d207d) Layer 3 and potentially ephermeral Layer 4 (L4) sequencers used for RYO sessions.\n\n**Use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: DW and RYO game rounds will employ zkproofs for aggregating and settling transactions onto the OP Mainnet. This reduces transaction costs, while maintaining the integrity and transparency of the game. Leveraging this technology entails deploying a STARK verifier and [fact registry](https://medium.com/starkware/the-fact-registry-a64aafb598b6) to OP Mainnet, necessary for registering outcomes of higher layers to lower layers.\n\n**Layer 2 Integration**: A bridge will be developed to facilitate seamless interaction between L2 and L3+ layers. This bridge will support the transfer of assets and data. Cartridge will provide tooling and infrastructure to seamlessly move between chains. Additionally, Cartridge will extend the hustler configuration and indexing services to ensure functionality and compatibility with Dope World.\n\n**PAPER as Fee Token**: Transactions within the game and across the bridge will require PAPER tokens as fees. This integration provides utility to the PAPER token, enhancing its relevance within the ecosystem.\n\n### Timeline\n\nIt is expected that this work will be ready for testing in Q2 2024 and production in Q4. There are dependencies on proving infrastructure, audits, and settlement technologies that could delay the production deployment. The Cartridge team has a track record of delivering innovative technologies to the Dope Wars ecosystem and will continue with that commitment.\n\n### Compensation\n\nThe proposal requests 100k OP tokens as compensation for the development and deployment of these features, vested over 1 year.\n\n### Maintainance\n\nCartridge will operate the L3 network. The operation of the Dope World network, including sequencing, proving, and settlment onto OP Mainnet, will be covered by transaction fees. The DAO can optionally assess a fee margin to be deposited back into the DAO treasury or burned.\n\n### Intellectual Property\n\nFor this project, any new intellectual property created by Cartridge, while working in the dopedao github repositories (e.g., any new intellectual property created while extending the hustler configuration and indexing services to ensure functionality and compatibility with Dope World) will be licensed under CC0, MIT, or a similar open-source license that is equally permissive. Cartridge shall otherwise retain sole discretion to determine whether and how any other intellectual property it developed or will develop may be licensed to assigned to this project.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis proposal aims to bring innovative gaming experiences to the Dope Wars ecosystem, leveraging the latest in blockchain technology for enhanced gameplay and user interaction. The integration of zkproofs and the development of a new L2 <-> L3 bridge are particularly noteworthy, as they represent significant advancements in blockchain gaming infrastructure.",

As you're aware, the initial allocation was formulated with a significant focus on user incentives, aimed at fostering engagement and growth within our ecosystem. However, as the project has evolved, it has become increasingly clear that a realignment of our resources is necessary.\n\nThe development and refinement of our core offerings must take precedence. The user incentives, while valuable, should follow the establishment of a robust and fully-functional platform. To this end, I propose a revision in the allocation of the OP grant\n\nThe original proposal allocated 50% (150,000 OP) towards user incentives. However, considering our current situation it is evident that channeling more of these resources into development will yield long-term benefits, not only for the Dope Wars but also for our users and the wider community.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeidradifus54m2tdv7yrscjfobm3faqcohg7kkhyxfunm4zksl76xy)\n\nI propose reducing the OP allocation for user incentives to 25,000 OP and redirecting the remaining funds towards development efforts. Concurrently, we replace the reduced OP user incentives with the intension to use PAPER token as user incentives. This strategic shift allows us to maintain a reward pool for user engagement while channeling vital resources into accelerating the development of key features, enhancing platform stability, and enriching the overall user experience. By reallocating our resources in this manner, we prioritize building a solid foundation for Dope Wars, ensuring that our user incentives are supporting a more polished, engaging, and stable ecosystem\n\nCurrent usage of OP grant..\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeigtyir2krrrja2yw7tsixspadcbygt6tgltbkbrufr7h3vudyzbpq)\n\nI understand that this proposal represents a significant shift from our initial allocation strategy. However, I believe it is a necessary step to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of our project. By focusing on development now, we are setting the stage for a more vibrant and engaging platform that users will be excited to explore and interact with.",

Having a council that has the freedom to tweak these parameters seems more efficient.\n\nHow:\n\n@sprtn, @Slasha, @mazzi, @taniela.taki, @winstonwolfe would form such a council, with a mandate of 12 months beginning upon execution of successful vote. Any change to the council will have to be voted under a new DIP.  The council would have freedom to adjust current $Paper liquidity in order to maximize the project success. The Council itself will require a four out of five quorum of agreement to make adjustments to the liquidity situation.\n\nLimitations:\n\nThe council can’t deploy additional liquidity or it can’t remove existing liquidity without a DIP that authorises it to do so. Only existing liquidity can be rearranged between chains, exchanges, ranges within a single exchange, etc.\n\nFor your consideration\n\nTani & Mazzi",

      "title": "DIP-87: Layers of Dope",
      "content": "### Summary\n\nThe proposal focuses on deploying [Dope World](https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xfefee96a321ccc218d26c9f913bbd24cf2d733c801d030e863362b45388d207d) (DW) and [Roll Your Own](https://rollyourown.preview.cartridge.gg/) (RYO) as a Layer 3 (L3) application on top of the OP Mainnet. This proposal is an extension of [DIP-75: Dope World](https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xfefee96a321ccc218d26c9f913bbd24cf2d733c801d030e863362b45388d207d), the first version of RYO will still be deployed to Starknet in the short term according to the original proposal.\n\nThis extension will utilize [Cartridge Slot](https://cartridge.gg/blog/introducing-slot) with [Katana](https://book.dojoengine.org/toolchain/katana/overview.html) for execution, taking advantage of [zero-knowledge proofs (zkproofs) and fractal scaling](https://www.dojoengine.org/en/articles/provable-games/) to provide cheap, low latency, high throughput compute that will be settled on to OP Mainnet. The L3 network will use PAPER tokens for transaction fees. The proposal also includes the development of a bridge between Layer 2 (L2) and L3 for briding tokens and data between the networks.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\n**Layer 3 Deployment**: DW and RYO will be launched as an L3 application, leveraging the scalability and efficiency of Dojo and Cartridge Slot. The exact scaling architecture is still being defined, there will likely be a persistent [Dope World](https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xfefee96a321ccc218d26c9f913bbd24cf2d733c801d030e863362b45388d207d) Layer 3 and potentially ephermeral Layer 4 (L4) sequencers used for RYO sessions.\n\n**Use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: DW and RYO game rounds will employ zkproofs for aggregating and settling transactions onto the OP Mainnet. This reduces transaction costs, while maintaining the integrity and transparency of the game. Leveraging this technology entails deploying a STARK verifier and [fact registry](https://medium.com/starkware/the-fact-registry-a64aafb598b6) to OP Mainnet, necessary for registering outcomes of higher layers to lower layers.\n\n**Layer 2 Integration**: A bridge will be developed to facilitate seamless interaction between L2 and L3+ layers. This bridge will support the transfer of assets and data. Cartridge will provide tooling and infrastructure to seamlessly move between chains. Additionally, Cartridge will extend the hustler configuration and indexing services to ensure functionality and compatibility with Dope World.\n\n**PAPER as Fee Token**: Transactions within the game and across the bridge will require PAPER tokens as fees. This integration provides utility to the PAPER token, enhancing its relevance within the ecosystem.\n\n### Timeline\n\nIt is expected that this work will be ready for testing in Q2 2024 and production in Q4. There are dependencies on proving infrastructure, audits, and settlement technologies that could delay the production deployment. The Cartridge team has a track record of delivering innovative technologies to the Dope Wars ecosystem and will continue with that commitment.\n\n### Compensation\n\nThe proposal requests 100k OP tokens as compensation for the development and deployment of these features, vested over 1 year.\n\n### Maintainance\n\nCartridge will operate the L3 network. The operation of the Dope World network, including sequencing, proving, and settlment onto OP Mainnet, will be covered by transaction fees. The DAO can optionally assess a fee margin to be deposited back into the DAO treasury or burned.\n\n### Intellectual Property\n\nFor this project, any new intellectual property created by Cartridge, while working in the dopedao github repositories (e.g., any new intellectual property created while extending the hustler configuration and indexing services to ensure functionality and compatibility with Dope World) will be licensed under CC0, MIT, or a similar open-source license that is equally permissive. Cartridge shall otherwise retain sole discretion to determine whether and how any other intellectual property it developed or will develop may be licensed to assigned to this project.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis proposal aims to bring innovative gaming experiences to the Dope Wars ecosystem, leveraging the latest in blockchain technology for enhanced gameplay and user interaction. The integration of zkproofs and the development of a new L2 <-> L3 bridge are particularly noteworthy, as they represent significant advancements in blockchain gaming infrastructure.",

      "content": "GM Hustlers,\n\nThis proposal seeks approval for the formation of the $Paper Liquidity Council to optimise liquidity for the DAO.\n\nWhy:\n\nIn the upcoming months we will likely need to make many adjustments around our liquidity – think; range rebalances, chain liquidity rebalances, etc. It is neither ideal nor workable to have a vote for each single adjustment. Having a council that has the freedom to tweak these parameters seems more efficient.\n\nHow:\n\n@sprtn, @Slasha, @mazzi, @taniela.taki, @winstonwolfe would form such a council, with a mandate of 12 months beginning upon execution of successful vote. Any change to the council will have to be voted under a new DIP.  The council would have freedom to adjust current $Paper liquidity in order to maximize the project success. The Council itself will require a four out of five quorum of agreement to make adjustments to the liquidity situation.\n\nLimitations:\n\nThe council can’t deploy additional liquidity or it can’t remove existing liquidity without a DIP that authorises it to do so. Only existing liquidity can be rearranged between chains, exchanges, ranges within a single exchange, etc.\n\nFor your consideration\n\nTani & Mazzi",

      "title": "DIP-89: Reallocation of OP Grant Resources ",
      "content": "# Strategic Reallocation of OP Grant Resources \n\nI am writing to address an essential aspect of our ongoing project development — addressing the allocation of the OP grant we received over a year ago. As you're aware, the initial allocation was formulated with a significant focus on user incentives, aimed at fostering engagement and growth within our ecosystem. However, as the project has evolved, it has become increasingly clear that a realignment of our resources is necessary.\n\nThe development and refinement of our core offerings must take precedence. The user incentives, while valuable, should follow the establishment of a robust and fully-functional platform. To this end, I propose a revision in the allocation of the OP grant \n\nThe original proposal allocated 50% (150,000 OP) towards user incentives. However, considering our current situation it is evident that channeling more of these resources into development will yield long-term benefits, not only for the Dope Wars but also for our users and the wider community. \n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidradifus54m2tdv7yrscjfobm3faqcohg7kkhyxfunm4zksl76xy)\n    \n\nI propose reducing the OP allocation for user incentives to 25,000 OP and redirecting the remaining funds towards development efforts. Concurrently, we replace the reduced OP user incentives with the intension to use PAPER token as user incentives. This strategic shift allows us to maintain a reward pool for user engagement while channeling vital resources into accelerating the development of key features, enhancing platform stability, and enriching the overall user experience. By reallocating our resources in this manner, we prioritize building a solid foundation for Dope Wars, ensuring that our user incentives are supporting a more polished, engaging, and stable ecosystem\n\nCurrent usage of OP grant..\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeigtyir2krrrja2yw7tsixspadcbygt6tgltbkbrufr7h3vudyzbpq)\n\n  I understand that this proposal represents a significant shift from our initial allocation strategy. However, I believe it is a necessary step to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of our project. By focusing on development now, we are setting the stage for a more vibrant and engaging platform that users will be excited to explore and interact with.",

The intent is to take the possession or custody of the platforms and accounts away from individual Member responsibility and place them within the custody of the DopeLabs structure in a way that best protects against single points of failure. To create a system, as best as we currently can, that makes our DAO protocols as strong and durable as possible. The key is that the DAO should survive and be functional independent of any individual actions, inactions and/or personal events etc. The accounts in question are detailed below.\n\n### How:\n\nOverall the method will be to transfer the base email for the accounts away from personal Member emails and to a set of @dopewars.gg email accounts that are managed by their respective core unit.\n\nThe move away from singular access will prevent system failure should anything unforeseen happen to any individual Member.\n\nIt will also route custody of the communication and tech accounts in Official DOPE DAO email accounts, these are then part of the DopeLabs structure.\n\nAs we know DopeLabs Members will be elected through DAO vote, the structure stays extant as Members come and go filling positions that need to be filled. With this being the foundation principle there are slight differences between some of the platforms.\n\n***\n\n### Discord:\n\nCurrent server owner: Dennison Bertram\nProposed: 2FA held by the Operations Unit\nConsiderations: A cold account to be provisioned and kept offline on a separate device. Only to be used in emergencies. All existing roles and structures will be audited and lowest privileges will be granted to ensure a compromised “elevated” account can do minimal damage.\n\n***\n\n### Telegram:\n\nCurrent account owner: 2FA held by the Operations Unit\nProposed: No change\nConsiderations: The ownership rights can be transferred to a new administrator if/when the Operations Manager is changed. The fail safe mechanism is if the owner account becomes inactive for 3 months it will be automatically deleted by Telegram and the Ownership Rights for the Official Group and Portal Group will be transferred to the next admin in the hierarchy. In this instance it will be set to transfer to the Operations Capo, following that the Diffusion Don.\n\n***\n\n### Google Workspace and Cloud\n\nCurrent: Faces\nProposed: 2FA held by Operations and Engineering Unit\n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing. The workspace and cloud management will be joint by the Operations and Engineering unit.\n\n***\n\n### Dopewars.gg Domain:\n\nCurrent: Faces\nProposed: 2FA held by Protocol Unit\n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing.\n\n***\n\n### Alchemy:\n\nCurrent: Faces\nProposed: 2FA held by Engineering Unit.\n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing.\n\n***\n\n### Figma:\n\nCurrent: Faces\nProposed: 2FA held by Engineering Unit.\n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing.\n\n***\n\n### Vercel:\n\nCurrent: Faces\nProposed: 2FA held by Engineering Unit.\n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing.\n\n***\n\n### Notion:\n\nCurrent: Faces\nProposed: 2FA by the Operations Unit\n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing. Additional Workspace members to be assigned to other DopeLabs core units to manage guest access to pages for collaboration\n\n***\n\n### GitHub:\n\nCurrent admin: dennison, perama, rafael and tarrence\nProposed: Tarrence and a Cold account for ownership access.\n\nConsiderations: Account contact email to be changed from <dopewarsdao@protonmail.com> to an @dopewars.gg address. Tarrence Van Eva, as a doxed individual active in the crypto ecosystem, and a founder of DOPE, plus a cold account as a redundancy to hold owner access to GitHub.\n\nAdditional teams within the org to be created,\n\none for the Engineering Unit to be able to review, push directly onto master (hot hotfixes only), approve PRs, manage repositories (permissions/members/teams) etc.\n\nOne for Contributors with ability to do PRs.\n\n***\n\n### Security Protocols:\n\nWe have to create a method until such time as DAO tools are built to plug these gaps, if we leave the accounts in control on single Members then we expose the DAO to the risk that we lose our Communications and Tech platforms altogether.\n\nMember access will be granted to core unit members to allow them to operate as required. Where possible the ownership or Administrator account will be kept as a cold account and only accessed when required.\n\nA password vault will be used to store passwords and information. Access will only be granted as needed to the respective core units.\n\nIn the event of new members being elected to DopeLabs or if a Member steps down or is removed from DopeLabs then the password will be rotated and member access will be updated accordingly.\n\nPlatformCurrent AccessProposed AccessDiscordDennison BertramOperations UnitTelegramOperations UnitNo changeFigmaFacesofEthOperations UnitGoogle Suite and CloudFacesofEthOperations Unit and Engineering UnitDopewars.gg DomainFacesofEthProtocol UnitAlchemyFacesofEthEngineering UnitNotionFacesofEthOperations UnitGitHubTarrenceTarrence and Engineering UnitVercelFaceOfEthEngineering Unit",

      "title": "DIP-76(a) DAO Accounts Consolidation",
      "content": "**Summary:**\n\nWith DopeLabs up and running bringing structure to DOPE DAO now is the time to move ownership of our communications and tech platforms away from their centralised position and into the decentralised structure we have created. The intent is to take the possession or custody of the platforms and accounts away from individual Member responsibility and place them within the custody of the DopeLabs structure in a way that best protects against single points of failure. To create a system, as best as we currently can, that makes our DAO protocols as strong and durable as possible. The key is that the DAO should survive and be functional independent of any individual actions, inactions and/or personal events etc. The accounts in question are detailed below.\n\n\n\n**How:**\n\nOverall the method will be to transfer the base email for the accounts away from personal Member emails and to @dopewars.gg email account that will be officially controlled by the Operations Core Unit but accessible by each of the Core Unit Members. The move away from singular access will prevent system failure should anything unforeseen happen to any individual Member. It will also route custody of the communication and tech accounts in an Official DOPE DAO email account, these are then part of the DopeLabs structure. As we know DopeLabs Members will be elected through DAO vote, the structure stays extant as Members come and go filling positions that need to be filled. With this being the foundation principle there are slight differences between some of the platforms.\n\n***\n\n\n\n**Discord:**\n\nCurrent server owner: Dennison Bertram Proposed: 2FA held by the Operations Unit Considerations: A cold account to be provisioned and kept offline on a separate device. Only to be used in emergencies. All existing roles and structures will be audited and lowest privileges will be granted to ensure a compromised “elevated” account can do minimal damage.\n\n***\n\n\n\n**Telegram:** Current account owner: 2FA held by the Operations Unit Proposed: No change Considerations: The ownership rights can be transferred to a new administrator if/when the Operations Manager is changed. The fail safe mechanism is if the owner account becomes inactive for 3 months it will be automatically deleted by Telegram and the Ownership Rights for the Official Group and Portal Group will be transferred to the next admin in the hierarchy. In this instance it will be set to transfer to the Operations Capo, following that the Diffusion Don.\n\n***\n\n\n\n**Google Suite and Cloud** Current: Faces Proposed: 2FA held by Operations and Engineering Unit\n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing. The workspace and cloud management will be joint by the Operations and Engineering unit.\n\n***\n\n\n\n**Dopewars.gg Domain:**\n\nCurrent: Faces Proposed: 2FA held by Protocol Unit\n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing.\n\n***\n\n\n\n**Alchemy:** Current: Faces Proposed: 2FA held by Engineering Unit.\n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing.\n\n***\n\n\n\n**Figma:** Current: Faces \\*\\*\\*\\*Proposed: 2FA held by Engineering Unit.\n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing.\n\n***\n\n\n\n**Vercel:** Current: Faces \\*\\*\\*\\*Proposed: 2FA held by Engineering Unit.\n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing.\n\n***\n\n\n\n**Notion:**\n\nCurrent: Faces Proposed: 2FA by the Operations Unit\n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing. Additional Workspace members to be assigned to other DopeLabs core units to manage guest access to pages for collaboration\n\n***\n\n\n\n**GitHub:** Current admin: dennison, perama, rafael and tarrence Proposed: Tarrence and a Cold account for ownership access.\n\nConsiderations: Account contact email to be changed from <dopewarsdao@protonmail.com> to an @dopewars.gg address. Tarrence Van Eva, as a doxed individual active in the crypto ecosystem, and a founder of DOPE, plus a cold account as a redundancy to hold owner access to GitHub.\n\nAdditional teams within the org to be created,\n\none for the Engineering Unit to be able to review, push directly onto master (hot hotfixes only), approve PRs, manage repositories (permissions/members/teams) etc.\n\nOne for Contributors with ability to do PRs.\n\n***\n\n\n\n**Security Protocols:**\n\nWe have to create a method until such time as DAO tools are built to plug these gaps, if we leave the accounts in control on single Members then we expose the DAO to the risk that we lose our Communications and Tech platforms altogether. But the requirement to have access by multiple Members brings risk. A core email address @dopewars.gg will be in the official custody of the Operations Manager as elected by the DAO. Each member of DopeLabs will have password access to this email address and will be required to both keep the password secure and forbidden to share access with any other person. In the event of new members being elected to DopeLabs or if a Member steps down or is removed from DopeLabs then the password will be changed.\n\n\n\n<https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xd8a51edcfd0f46214f9e18aaee210097fdf8819d799b385cc4a1b7316ffc8437>",

      "title": "DIP-76(a) DAO Accounts Consolidation",
      "content": "### Summary:\n\nWith DopeLabs up and running bringing structure to DOPE DAO now is the time to move ownership of our communications and tech platforms away from their centralised position and into the decentralised structure we have created. The intent is to take the possession or custody of the platforms and accounts away from individual Member responsibility and place them within the custody of the DopeLabs structure in a way that best protects against single points of failure. To create a system, as best as we currently can, that makes our DAO protocols as strong and durable as possible. The key is that the DAO should survive and be functional independent of any individual actions, inactions and/or personal events etc. The accounts in question are detailed below. \n\n### How:\n\nOverall the method will be to transfer the base email for the accounts away from personal Member emails and to a set of @dopewars.gg email accounts that are managed by their respective core unit.\n\nThe move away from singular access will prevent system failure should anything unforeseen happen to any individual Member. \n\nIt will also route custody of the communication and tech accounts in Official DOPE DAO email accounts, these are then part of the DopeLabs structure. \n\nAs we know DopeLabs Members will be elected through DAO vote, the structure stays extant as Members come and go filling positions that need to be filled. With this being the foundation principle there are slight differences between some of the platforms.\n\n---\n\n### Discord:\n\nCurrent server owner:  Dennison Bertram\nProposed: 2FA held by the Operations Unit\nConsiderations: A cold account to be provisioned and kept offline on a separate device. Only to be used in emergencies. All existing roles and structures will be audited and lowest privileges will be granted to ensure a compromised “elevated” account can do minimal damage. \n\n---\n\n### Telegram:\n\nCurrent account owner: 2FA held by the Operations Unit\nProposed: No change\nConsiderations: The ownership rights can be transferred to a new administrator if/when the Operations Manager is changed. The fail safe mechanism is if the owner account becomes inactive for 3 months it will be automatically deleted by Telegram and the Ownership Rights for the Official Group and Portal Group will be transferred to the next admin in the hierarchy. In this instance it will be set to transfer to the Operations Capo, following that the Diffusion Don. \n\n---\n\n### Google Workspace and Cloud\n\nCurrent: Faces\nProposed: 2FA held by Operations and Engineering Unit\n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing. The workspace and cloud management will be joint by the Operations and Engineering unit.\n\n---\n\n### Dopewars.gg Domain:\n\nCurrent: Faces\nProposed: 2FA held by Protocol Unit \n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing. \n\n---\n\n### Alchemy:\n\nCurrent: Faces\nProposed: 2FA held by Engineering Unit. \n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing. \n\n---\n\n### Figma:\n\nCurrent: Faces\nProposed: 2FA held by Engineering Unit. \n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing. \n\n---\n\n### Vercel:\n\nCurrent: Faces\nProposed: 2FA held by Engineering Unit. \n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing. \n\n---\n\n### Notion:\n\nCurrent: Faces\nProposed: 2FA by the Operations Unit\n\nConsiderations: Currently billed to Faces credit card and reimbursed by the DAO. Upon receipt of the DAO credit card (DIP 77), this will be used for billing. Additional Workspace members to be assigned to other DopeLabs core units to manage guest access to pages for collaboration\n\n---\n\n### GitHub:\n\nCurrent admin: dennison, perama, rafael and tarrence\nProposed: Tarrence and a Cold account for ownership access.\n\nConsiderations: Account contact email to be changed from dopewarsdao@protonmail.com to an @dopewars.gg address. Tarrence Van Eva, as a doxed individual active in the crypto ecosystem, and a founder of DOPE, plus a cold account as a redundancy to hold owner access to GitHub. \n\nAdditional teams within the org to be created, \n\none for the Engineering Unit to be able to review, push directly onto master (hot hotfixes only), approve PRs, manage repositories (permissions/members/teams) etc. \n\nOne for Contributors with ability to do PRs.\n\n---\n\n### Security Protocols:\n\nWe have to create a method until such time as DAO tools are built to plug these gaps, if we leave the accounts in control on single Members then we expose the DAO to the risk that we lose our Communications and Tech platforms altogether. \n\nMember access will be granted to core unit members to allow them to operate as required. Where possible the ownership or Administrator account will be kept as a cold account and only accessed when required.\n\nA password vault will be used to store passwords and information. Access will only be granted as needed to the respective core units. \n\nIn the event of new members being elected to DopeLabs or if a Member steps down or is removed from DopeLabs then the password will be rotated and member access will be updated accordingly.\n\n| Platform  | Current Access | Proposed Access |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Discord | Dennison Bertram | Operations Unit |\n| Telegram | Operations Unit | No change |\n| Figma | FacesofEth | Operations Unit |\n| Google Suite and Cloud | FacesofEth | Operations Unit and Engineering Unit |\n| Dopewars.gg Domain | FacesofEth | Protocol Unit |\n| Alchemy | FacesofEth | Engineering Unit |\n| Notion | FacesofEth | Operations Unit |\n| GitHub | Tarrence | Tarrence and Engineering Unit |\n| Vercel | FaceOfEth | Engineering Unit |",

      "content": "GM DOPEDAO\n\nDojo have announced the Holiday Game Jam and have invited DopeWars to sponsor the event. We have been invited to sponsor by creating our own Bounty Tracks and contributing to the General Prize Pool. In return for General Sponsorship we would be recognised via Dojo Game Jam promotions including Twitter, work-shop co-host, logo placement and a Bio on the Game Jam page. Bounty Tracks will also be promoted, but more importantly will have benefits discussed below.\n\n \n![Dojo_Winter_Game_Jam.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeigmvrmjwforgr2uj2e4wgm72gw4uyfh2os6ecafr2pojvewyacvbq)\n    \n\nAs a background for those Hustlers not familiar, Dojo is an Open-Source toolchain to build on-chain games leveraging the StarkNet stack. Amongst chief contributors toward this effort have been our friends from the Cartridge crew (DopeWars OG’s). The Dojo project has been gaining a lot of momentum recently and getting into the spotlight for all the right reasons. \n\nCheck here: @dojostarknet & dojoengine.com\n\nDojo have run Game Jams in the past that have had up to 150 Developers sign up.  This upcoming Game Jam is a larger two-week holiday Game Jam (Dec 15-Jan 2).\n\n \n![Dopewars dojo game jam.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeib743czq6teccpsowbavhcz4wphmfedoywaupkq37tpaeecqpitwi)\n    \n\nThe DopeLabs team feel this is a great opportunity to attract Developers to the DopeWars ecosystem, help fuel growth and build Mods for DopeWorld the Autonomous World on StarkNet. Generally the idea will be; offer awareness to the Developers about the DopeWars universe, show them the primitives (the seeds of DopeWorld), have a prepared list of possible dope game ideas and then offer bounty for the coolest MOD(s) with the most potential. \n\nIncluded in the Bounty Track (or Bounties - the exact compilation is yet to be determined) will be DOPE(s), so that winners can become part of the DAO. Also, an invitation to meet with the DopeLabs Crew to help create proposals to make, or further enhance, Mods for DopeWorld. We have stepped off well with Cartridge Seeding DopeWorld and building RYO. We see this as a pathway to keep development roaring and capitalize on the excitement we are creating. The method by which to judge the winners will be established in the months ahead - DopeLabs will seek input from the community and come up with a way that gets the best possible outcome. \n\nThis proposal seeks to authorise 15M $Paper to be used to support this initiative. We already have 4 DOPEs earmarked in the current Marketing Multi-Sig Wallet that we propose to utilise as mentioned above. \n\nThe $Paper will be released to the DopeWars Marketing MultiSig.\n\nGood things happen to those who hustle.\n\nTani",

      "title": "DIP-82 SwapMeet Technical Audit",
      "content": "# Introduction\n\nThis audit proposal provides an overview of a comprehensive technical audit of SwapMeet's inventory management system. The primary objective of this audit is to identify technical issues and vulnerabilities related to the mishandling of users' NFTs, specifically 'gears' and 'hustlers.' These issues are believed to be rooted in an indexer failure, leading to three critical challenges:\n\n1. Inaccurate NFT Return (Gears and Hustlers)\nWe are presently grappling with challenges pertaining to the return of NFTs, particularly gears and hustlers. It is strongly suspected that this predicament is rooted in an indexer malfunction.\n2. Inability to Equip and Unequip Gears for Hustlers\nThe incapability to equip and unequip gears for hustlers represents a crucial functional breakdown, which is likely interlinked with the aforementioned indexer predicament.\n3. Failed Minting of Hustlers\nAlthough the customization of hustlers appears initially successful, the actual minting process on the blockchain fails. Curiously, the user interface continues to display the message \"Minting successful. Your hustler will arrive within 15 mins,\" despite the hustler never materializing.\n\nAdditionally, there is an inconsistency in minting Hustler operations where success is intermittent, remains elusive.\n\nIssues have been comprehensively documented in a video, accessible here: https://www.loom.com/share/cb8ade1556fe4f09b6b793b250b4c7d3\n\n# Objectives\n\nThe main objectives of this technical audit are as follows:\n\n1. Identify and document all technical issues related to the mishandling of NFTs, including inaccurate NFT return (gears and hustlers), inconsistent hustler minting results, and the inability to equip and unequip gears for hustlers.\n2. Assess the impact of these technical issues on the SwapMeet project's functionality and user experience.\n\n# Scope of work\n\nThe audit will employ a systematic methodology to achieve the defined objectives:\n\n1. Code Review: A thorough review of the SwapMeet project's source code will be conducted to identify any coding errors, vulnerabilities, or discrepancy.\n2. Indexer Assessment: The performance and reliability of the indexer responsible for handling NFT data will be scrutinized, including its integration with Alchemy. Any anomalies or errors in indexing data will be identified.\n3. Smart Contract Analysis: The smart contracts governing NFT minting and related functionalities will be analyzed to uncover any issues in the minting process, including failures and inconsistent outcomes.\n4. Front-end Assessment and potential fix implementation: Identifying issue and addressing the frontend problem that leads to an incorrect message during the hustler NFT minting, ensuring it is synchronized with the on-chain operation\n\n# Deliverables\n\nUpon completion of the audit, the following deliverables will be provided:\n\n1. Audit Report: A comprehensive report detailing all identified technical issues, their impact, and recommendations.\n2. Possible Fix: Addressing the frontend problem that leads to an incorrect message during the hustler NFT minting, ensuring it is synchronized with the on-chain operation\n\n# Timeline\n\nThe audit timeline will be determined based on the complexity of the identified issues and the scope of necessary fixes. A preliminary estimate is as follows:\n\n- Code Review and Indexer Assessment: Approximately 3 weeks\n- Smart Contract Analysis: Approximately 2 weeks\n- Front-end Examination: Approximately 1 week\n\n# Resource Allocation\n\nThe project will involve the allocation of the following resources:\n\n- 1 Senior Full Stack- Blockchain Developer\n- 1 Intermediate Backend- Blockchain Developer\n- 1 Intermediate Fronted- Blockchain Developer\n- 1 QA and Project Manager\n\n# Access Requirements\n\nFor the successful execution of this project, the team will necessitate the following access:\n\n- Access to the live SwapMeet application for issue investigation and fix implementation, including server GCP access.\n- Permissions to merge pull requests (PRs) in the GitHub repositories associated with SwapMeet. This is a critical requirement for code change commits and potential front-end fixes.\n- Inclusion in the Alchemy team of Dopewars to aid in the investigation of event processing.\n\n# Cost Estimate\n\nGiven the scope of work and timeline outlined above, the total compensation for these tasks is estimated to be **$15,650**.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nKindly acknowledge that the provided estimates are subject to adjustments based on real time challenges encountered during the investigation and implementation phases. We pledge to furnish regular updates to the Dopewars DAO as the work progresses.\n\nThe Dopewars DAO is strongly encouraged to collaborate closely with the technical team to ensure the efficacious resolution of these issues and the enhancement of the inventory management system.\n\nSincerely,\n\nUnix Labs",

See at here: https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xd934aef8e71d1528f0dd2968344a31ea0bbe3b3ea67fd387c0e45a5b958ecfa4\n\nSo I have explored the option recommended by Winston Wolfe with UTGL.\nUTGL are Hong Kong based and will offer the DAO an EMI card provided I KYC and act as the UBO.\n\nThe card will be a debit style card that is linked to an account. Funds can only be spent if corresponding funds are placed into the account. The EMI card will serve the purpose of paying DAO FIAT expenses by converting Crypto into FIAT at a LVR ration of 90%. This means if we pay $1000 USDC into the account we could draw down $900. Therefore the account will only be able to ever be in positive credit. Which is a good safety feature for the DAO and for me being the UBO.\n\nAside from the $1000 USD set up fee (payable in crypto) the fees are:\nUSDC/T to USD: 1%\nOverseas card spending: 1.95%\nATM withdrawal: 2.5%\n\nThis proposal will authorise the release $1000 USD set up fee as well as $1000 USD to put onto the card (both values equivalent in ETH).\n\nThanks for your patience.\nTani",

      "content": "GM Dope DAO\n\nWith previous attempts to source a DAO Credit card failing, I have followed up on an introduction by Mr Winston Wolfe to check out the UTGL Group.\nhttps://utgl.io/\n\nSee previous Snapshot here: https://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xd934aef8e71d1528f0dd2968344a31ea0bbe3b3ea67fd387c0e45a5b958ecfa4\n\nLike previous attempts, this organisation is also unwilling to issue a card to a DAO as an entity. However they have confirmed that they would be willing to issue a card that would be in the DAO's name provided I would act as the Ultimate Beneficial Owner.\n\nUTGL are Hong Kong based and the card they would provide is an asset linked credit card. Digital funds need to deposited within a linked account before any funds could be spent on the card. The card can only be spent at a Loan to Value ration of 90% of the Stables in the linked account. These measures would mean that we would never actually be able to go into 'debt' using the card. It would always function on a pre paid basis. Which would be ideal given that I would have to KYC as the UBO. \n\nThe cost/fees details are as follows:\nUSDC/T to USD: 1%\nOverseas card spending: 1.95%\nATM withdrawal: 2.5% (We wouldn't use this)\nSet up fee: USD 1,000 payable in digital assets.\n\nIt seems as though DAO's have a long way to go in the eyes of financial institutions. Which is understandable. I feel like this would be the best option we can secure at this time so we can use DAO digital funds to make payments required by the DAO.\n\nThis vote would authorise the expenditure of $1000 USD to set up the card with UTGL.\n\nTani",

The compensation scheme from the proposal can be seen below:\n\nCartridge proposes the following compensation to support development costs and participate in the Dope World. PAPER will be vested over 1 year from the date of delivery of the milestone. \n\n- Seeding Dope World - 25M PAPER \n- Roll Your Own Alpha - 10m PAPER \n- Roll Your Own Beta - 15m PAPER \n- Roll Your Own Mainnet - 25m PAPER \n\nAs such, 10M $Paper will be vested to Cartridge.eth over the 12 month period beginning 20th July 2023 ending 20th July 2024.\n\n## Vesting\nI have researched a suitable vesting protocol called Sablier. \n\n### https://sablier.com\nSablier started in 2019 as one of the first streaming protocols. They reached 1.5B TVL at its height and are still doing large numbers. They have had five majors audits, they have a bounty to check for bugs - they haven't been hacked (yet haha). The good news is that they are not currently (nor in immediate future) charging fees; they have VC backing so they are in customer exploration mode. We can utilise their services to create a linear stream vesting the funds over the 12 month period. Cartridge is happy with this protocol and willing to assume the risk if something went wrong with the protocol.\nThis proposal will execute the release of 10M $Paper to the Vesting Protocol which will then stream the funds linearly to Cartridge.eth. \nTani",

The first adjustment I propose is the removal of the Job Description of Project Manager in the Engineer Cell. Despite best intentions for this role, it has been evident that it is not a realistic, useful or indeed used role for DOPE DAO. The Decentralised and Autonomous nature of the project means that the overall strategy of the DAO is determined by the DAO itself through the Decentralised Protocols we have in place. Yes this make things challenging, but this is how it is and part of what makes DopeWars unique. I propose that instead we establish a role of ‘Paper Don’ to sit within the Protocol Cell to take care of matters Treasury/Liquidity related. See below Job description.\nThe second adjustment is a proposed change in Pay Scales to bring members to parity, and a slight change within the Diffusion Cell & Protocol Cell. The Diffusion Cell is changed to create three equal positions that can work as a team. The nature of the Diffusion Cell tasks are the most relentless and continuous. Through all times the Diffusion Cell needs to continue the promotion of DopeWars. It will make it more manageable/sustainable for the cell to have a team that can work around the clock. This helps to account for different time zones as well. RichBlck has developed immensely over the last 6 months and mrfax has proven his worth.

The team collaborated with a game studio (UnixLabs) and designed an engaging single-player game where players could destroy parts of the city to gain points. However, the team soon realized that the game lacked the engagement needed to bring users together, so they incorporated a battle-royale style event where players could compete against each other for points. \n\nThe Beta received plenty of feedback and from that there has been further evolution;\n\nthe following are subject to discovery\n\n**Version release;**\n\n- Web2 release on platforms such as Steam to capture traditional gamers. This will be without any NFT integration.\n- Web3 release with NFT integration to our assets such as, Hustlers, L2 Items, Paper, Dope Name Service. This will give in-game benefits to players based on their loadout. The use of the OP User Incentive tokens can be used to facilitate winnings, tournaments and other events.\n\n**Game modes;**\n\n- Story mode will provide a quest line of missions to run throughout DopeCity.\n- Frenzy mode is an open world to gain as many points as possible before time runs out or your get wasted by the police\n- PvP mode is to play against other players in a death match or team death match. In-game objectives to facilitate player engagement.\n\n**Game Features;** \n\n- Players will be able to roam DopeCity.\n- Players will see a general HUD to provide information.\n- Players can run or short bursts of sprints.\n- Players can use vehicles and weapons (projectile or melee) against other players.\n- Players can use In-game chat.\n- Players can destroy parts of DopeCity.\n- Players can listen to the in-game music player.\n- Players can use the PvP lobby system to join games.\n\n## ****Components & Responsibilities****\n\nThe following are new additions;\n\n### Break Glass in Emergency Clause\n\n**Preamble:**\n\n(a)   The collaboration between the team (UnixLabs) and DOPE DAO is based upon a foundation of good faith partnership. Each party will commit to act reasonably to create a working environment that promotes successful collaboration and mutual benefit.\n\n(b)   DOPE DAO is willing to invest into the 'DopeWars Mean Streets' project.\n\n**INVESTMENT and CODE development:**\n\nThe team (UnixLabs)  shall remain in control of the code that pertains to the 'DopeWars Mean Streets' project, unless the Trigger Event occurs, following which DOPE DAO chooses to execute an Option. Upon receipt of investments from DOPE DAO, the team shall continue development of the project.\n\n**Trigger Events** means circumstances in which:\n\nThe team (UnixLabs) is unable to continue the development of the project for more that 6 consecutive months; or\n\nThe team (UnixLabs) is unwilling to continue the development of the project and does not notify DOPE DAO accordingly.\n\nIn the event that a Trigger Event occurs, DOPE DAO shall have the option to buy out the code pertaining to the project at a price equal to double the amount of funds spent on graphics and development, unless the parties agree upon other conditions through mutual consent.\n\nThe minimum buyout price of the code pertaining to the project, before any investments from DOPE DAO, is $150,000.\n\n### Graphics Advisor - HPMNK\n\nHPMNK to lead in an advisory role to an art studio from UnixLabs and provide style guidance, tools and settings to allow them to produce required graphics. HPMNK will run review and quality control. This will be addressed in a separate proposal.\n\nThe existing components and responsibilities are still intact and can be found here;\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0x1caeb717bc89ba89da7e816c43e2c58a1a2a763be001a265fa60bfdccdde5854\n\n## Budget\n\nThe budget has not changed since the previous snapshot, can be found here;\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0x1caeb717bc89ba89da7e816c43e2c58a1a2a763be001a265fa60bfdccdde5854\n\nThe budget total is $125k USD payable via the OP grant.\n\n1. 15k USD Reimbursement to Cyberbitz for the initial costs of the Frenzy Proof of Concept.\n2. 110k USD to UnixLabs for, but not limited to;\n    1. Development of 3 game modes - Story mode, Frenzy mode and PvP mode.\n    2. Development of any Smart contracts / NFT integrations required.\n    3. Bug fixes and scaling as required.\n    4. Distribution.\n\n## Milestones / Deliverables\n\nBeta release will be for each version of the game. UnixLabs will develop these in a non linear state. \n\n- A Web2 version on selected platforms with the base game features such as a player HUD, weapons, vehicles, DopeCity and mechanics such as melee/projectile fighting, vehicle use, map destruction, player combat. Further rollout of the additional game modes and features as required.\n- A Web3 version via web with the base game features as a player HUD, weapons, vehicles, DopeCity and mechanics such as melee/projectile fighting, vehicle use, map destruction, player combat, Web3 integration such as wallet connect and in-game item benefits.  Further rollout of the additional game modes and features as required.\n\nRelease 1.0\n\n- Final release of the Web2 version as 1.0 with required game features and mechanics and a monetization flow.\n- Final release of the Web3 version as 1.0 with required game features and mechanics and required Web3 integrations.\n\n## Progress Updates\n\nBelow are the formal update frequencies on project development;\n\n- Fortnightly updates will be provided and posted across our DopeWars platforms.\n- Monthly AMAs will be held to provide an open forum for the DAO.\n\n## **Monetization / Revenue**\n\nThe game will have multiple possibilities for monetization and revenue. UnixLabs has offered to increase the revenue returned to the DAO from 5% to 50%.\n\n- The Web2 release of the game will be available for purchase on platforms such as Steam. The initial price will be decided closer to the release of the product. There will also be an opportunity to release DLC items. Porting to other platforms such as mobile and consoles is also an opportunity.\n- The Web3 release of the game will be available via the web and have NFT integrations with DopeWars assets such as, L2 gear from Optimism, Hustlers, Dope Name Service and Paper. The trading of these items via secondary sales will provide the DAO with 5% royalties. Ability to set seasons that increase/decrease benefits of items to entice trading is an option.",

All Members who have not Dissociated (as defined in Article X) shall be entitled to vote on any matter submitted to a vote of the Members at a meeting, via writing, or via smart contract. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any difference with respect to the ordinary course of the business shall be decided via a vote of the Members and shall require approval or consent of a majority vote by at least 6.25% of the Membership.\n\nARTICLE V (NEW)\nPROTOCOL MANAGEMENT AND MEMBER ADMINISTRATION\nV.1 Protocol Management. The management of the DAO, in all respects, shall be conducted via the DOPE DAO decentralised protocols as described in this Operating Agreement, principally Article VI DOPE DAO GOVERNANCE MECHANISM.\nV.2. Member Administration. The ordinary and usual administrative affairs of the Company shall be completed by contributing Members composed into \"Core Units\".\nV.2.1 Core Units shall be comprised of contributing Members who have the required ability, availability and willingness to participate. The Core Units will complete the day to day functions of the DAO necessary to administer the Purpose of the DAO. The DAO shall vote, via the DAO Governance Mechanism, to fill and fund these Core Units on a six monthly basis in advance.\n\nARTICLE VI (NEW)\nDOPE DAO GOVERNANCE MECHANISM\nVl.1 Official Proposal Process. The Official Proposal Process for any new order of business that relates to the functioning of the DAO shall begin with an \"Off-Chain Proposal\". This Off-Chain Proposal shall consist of a written description of the matter that is then submitted to vote on a suitable \"Off-Chain Voting Mechanism\". This proposal must then be made available for preview by DAO Members.\nVI.1.1 The Off-Chain Voting Mechanism must be such that a minimum of 3 DOPE Tokens are required for a Member to operate the Off-Chain Vote Mechanism. This Off-Chain Voting Mechanism must only count votes that represent Member owned DOPES and not delegated votes. The Off-Chain vote must meet quorum of 500 DOPES and the voting period must last a minimum of 120 hours.\nVI.1.2 Once the Off-Chain Vote has reached quorum and passed by majority vote, the proposal can proceed to a vote as an \"On-Chain Proposal\" on a suitable \"On-Chain Voting Mechanism\". The On-Chain Proposal must be the same in substance as the Off-Chain Proposal that passed by majority vote.\nVI.1.3 The On-Chain Voting Mechanism must be such that a minimum of 50 DOPES, owned or delegated, are required for a member to operate the On-Chain Voting Mechanism. The On-Chain voting mechanism shall count votes that represent owned DOPES and delegated votes, the voting period must last a minimum of 120 hours. The On-Chain vote is an automated majority pass function once a threshold of 500 affirming votes has been met.\nVI.2 Fundamental Transactions. Any proposal to use capital, IP or other asset as owned by the Company is defined as a Fundamental Transaction and must pass through the complete Official Proposal Process as described in Article VI.1 - VI.1.3. Exceptions to this rule may be made whereby a proposal designates the use of Capital, IP or other Asset to be distributed to a pre-established and precedented objective. In these instances proposals may proceed straight to an On-Chain Proposal to be put to vote.\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0x8b02752fc50382938fde7b95f63902db18113146e4e3e8a7e3455ae6681afcc8\n\nARTICLE VII (NEW)\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nUnless otherwise specified by proposal though the Official Proposal Process, all DOPE DAO and DopeWars code shall be presumed to be permissively licensed under the MIT software license.

      "title": "DIP-80 Intellectual Property",
      "content": "**CONTRACTING WITH DOPE DAO AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**\n\nThis issue has initially arisen due to the fact that there has been some contributors for whom signing the DOPE DAO Intellectual Property and Contractor Agreement would be detrimental to them. Recent events have also highlighted the importance of addressing the nature of our ‘Open Source’ based ecosystem. \n\nThe purpose of the DAO describes the development of a public good enterprise that empowers persons of creative talent and drive to build upon Web3 ideals of open source composability and decentralised community driven purpose.\n\nThe DOPE DAO Operating Agreement currently specifies:\n\nARTICLE VII (OLD) CONTRACTING TO DOPE DAO \n\nWhen any entity wishes to contract to the DAO in order to provide services required by the DAO the contractor must proceed through the Official Proposal Process as described in Article VI. The Contractor must sign the DOPE DAO Intellectual Property and Contractor Agreement, available by link on the Website DOPEWARS.GG. The Contractor will retain the right to protect their privacy.\n\nI propose that we amend this Article to read as such:\n\nARTICLE VII (NEW)\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n\nUnless otherwise specified by proposal though the Official Proposal Process, all DOPE DAO and DopeWars code shall be presumed to be permissively licensed under the MIT software license. All DOPE DAO and DopeWars art or media assets shall be licensed as Creative Commons Zero. \n\nARTICLE IX.2 SUBSEQUENT CONTRIBUTIONS.\n\nThis will be nixed, now irrelevant. \n\n\nThe value of being permissive:\nWith regard to code, the DAO Lawyer agrees that permissive licensing is better as opposed to the more restrictive CopyLeft type licensing. These more restrictive Open Source licenses require that any iteration of the said code is also licensed as such. So although this seems very open it is actually quite closed because it closes down many avenues of expansion that might be otherwise available. The value of being permissive is that the building, the expression, can grown unencumbered by any restraining factors. \n\n**MIT:**\n\nA permissive software license. Users of software using a MIT Licence are permitted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense and sell copies of the software. This is the most permissive of the licenses, a simple acknowledgement. It is important that we encourage the use of a single license, interoperability is challenged when multiple licenses are used. \n\nWith regard to Art/Media assets the Creative Commons Licenses are utilized. The benefits of being permissive are the same as with code. Builders, contributors, collaborators, artists are free to enhance the DOPEWARS ‘meme’ without fear of copyright infringement.\n\n**Creative Commons Zero:**\n\nCreative Commons Zero CC0, waives copyright, but does not necessarily waive moral rights or publicity rights. Moral Rights are a set of rights that belong to creators, including the right to be attributed as creator, the right to protect the integrity of the work, and the right to prevent work from being used in a way that could harm the creators reputation. Publicity rights are rights that protect the creators commercial use of their name, image and likeness.\n\nOverall the intent to to encourage/enable unconstrained growth of the DopeWars ecosystem as an idea. Similar in the way to many other projects that have successfully attracted huge popularity like (Nouns/Goblintown).\n\nOf course we cannot go so far as dictating that all DWs MODs/branches/projects MUST be permissively licensed. At the end of the day the governance process (being on chain) is immutable and sovereign. The game goes where the DOPE flows. But it is beneficial to encourage code to be Permissively licensed (under a single standard) and to establish our current art/media assets as CC0 to set a benchmark and encourage it further.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeifnba6bvb2cifdkpwi242ykei2r26x3imexmca3fb6vrbjyflwnru)\n    \nTani",

      "title": "DIP-78 Operating Agreement Amendment",
      "content": "GM DOPE DAO\n\nMIDAO have recently updated their KYC requirements to line up with the evolving situation that pertains to DAO’s and their status as Legal Entities. As you can see in the picture below the old compliance only mentions ‘beneficial owners’ with 25%+ governance rights. This was the guidance given to us during our registration process. You will see that, to reflect international standards, RMI has moved to direct that DAO LLC’s also KYC any Managing Members. \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicyvkynl25kepdwh2bez325ablz42tpisdp4kkgwobbooclddrszm)\n    \n\nThis does not impede DOPE DAO’s ability to continue as we are. As a true DAO we do not have any Managing Members that would meet the definitions applicable to the international standards. However I propose making some slight amendments to our Operating Agreement to more accurately describe our process and to align the wording to account for this recent development. This change is to reflect that those Members who conduct work within Dope Labs are more accurately described as fulfilling necessary administrative duties, and that the true ‘Management’ of the DAO is conducted by our decentralised protocols via the Official Proposal Process. \n\nIn the interest of efficiency I will also propose a couple of additional small amendments that have come to light in recent months.\n\nPROPOSED CHANGES WITH REGARD TO MANAGING MEMBERS.\n\nThis issue is relevant to the following articles.  I will display the original text and proposed change. \n\nARTICLE IV (OLD)\nRIGHTS AND DUTIES OF MEMBERS\nIV.1 Management Rights. All Members who have not Dissociated (as defined in Article X) shall be entitled to vote on any matter submitted to a vote of the Members at a meeting, via writing, or via smart contract. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any difference with respect to the ordinary course of the business shall be decided via a vote of the Members and shall require approval or consent of a majority vote by at least 6.25% of the Membership.\n\nARTICLE IV (NEW)\nRIGHTS AND DUTIES OF MEMBERS\nIV.1 Voting Rights. All Members who have not Dissociated (as defined in Article X) shall be entitled to vote on any matter submitted to a vote of the Members at a meeting, via writing, or via smart contract. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any difference with respect to the ordinary course of the business shall be decided via a vote of the Members and shall require approval or consent of a majority vote by at least 6.25% of the Membership.\n\nARTICLE V (OLD)\nMEMBER MANAGEMENT\nV.1 Member Management. The ordinary and usual decisions concerning business affairs of the Company shall be made by contributing Members composed into \"Core Units\".\nV.1.1 Core Units shall be comprised of contributing Members who have the required ability, availability and willingness to participate. The Core Units will complete the day to day functions of the DAO necessary to administer the Purpose of the DAO. The DAO shall vote, via the DAO Governance Mechanism, to fill and fund these Core Units on a six monthly basis in advance.\n\nARTICLE V (NEW)\nPROTOCOL MANAGEMENT AND MEMBER ADMINISTRATION\nV.1 Protocol Management. The management of the DAO, in all respects, shall be conducted via the DOPE DAO decentralised protocols as described in this Operating Agreement, principally Article VI DOPE DAO GOVERNANCE MECHANISM. \nV.2. Member Administration. The ordinary and usual administrative affairs of the Company shall be completed by contributing Members composed into \"Core Units\".\nV.2.1 Core Units shall be comprised of contributing Members who have the required ability, availability and willingness to participate. The Core Units will complete the day to day functions of the DAO necessary to administer the Purpose of the DAO. The DAO shall vote, via the DAO Governance Mechanism, to fill and fund these Core Units on a six monthly basis in advance.\n\nPROPOSED OPP CHANGE.\n\nIn recent DAO discussions it has been highlighted that the requirement of 5 DOPE Tokens to initiate an Off-Chain vote is too high a barrier for participation. The proposed amendment reduces this number to 3 DOPE Tokens. Our system is structured to allow maximum democratic value, with 1 DOPE equaling 1 Vote whilst making it practical during times of high Gas exposure via the use of delegates. This means that the Off-chain vote occupies the position of importance to allow the DAO to truly express its intentions. In the past there has not been a formal quorum or time requirement for the Off-Chain vote. This was due to worry that we may be setting an unreachable bar with regard to participation levels and imposing an unreasonable time constraint of the whole proposal process. However I believe that, because the Off-Chain aspect represents the more democratic ‘will’ of the DAO that it should have these important parameters surrounding it. This is important to ensure that the Proposals, put through the OPP, are suitably considered by a sufficient portion of the DAO over a sufficient time period. So you will see the changes below that introduce a quorum and voting time period requirement for the Off-Chain vote. Remember that there is allowance under VI.2 Fundamental Transactions, for ‘pre-established and precedented objectives’ to proceed straight to On-Chain vote to expediate governance. If you think of a regular type transaction that takes place like hosting or maintenance costs, these don’t have to got through the whole procedure. \n\nARTICLE VI (OLD)\n\nDOPE DAO GOVERNANCE MECHANISM\nVl.1 Official Proposal Process. The Official Proposal Process for any new order of business that relates to the functioning of the DAO shall begin with an \"Off-Chain Proposal\". This Off-Chain Proposal shall consist of a written description of the matter that is then submitted to vote on a suitable \"Off-Chain Voting Mechanism\". This proposal must then be made available for preview by DAO Members.\nVI.1.1 The Off-Chain Voting Mechanism must be such that a minimum of 5 DOPE Tokens are required for a Member to operate the Off-Chain Vote Mechanism. This Off-Chain Voting Mechanism must only count votes that represent Member owned DOPES and not delegated votes. The voting period must last a minimum of 72 hours.\nVI.1.2 Once the Off-Chain Vote has passed by majority vote, the proposal can proceed to a vote as an \"On-Chain Proposal\" on a suitable \"On-Chain Voting Mechanism\". The On-Chain Proposal must be the same in substance as the Off-Chain Proposal that passed by majority vote.\n\nVI.1.3 The On-Chain Voting Mechanism must be such that a minimum of 50 DOPES, owned or delegated, are required for a member to operate the On-Chain Voting Mechanism. The On-Chain voting mechanism shall count votes that represent owned DOPES and delegated votes, the voting period must last a minimum of 120 hours. The On-Chain vote is an automated majority pass function once a quorum of 500 votes has been met.\n\nVI.2 Fundamental Transactions. Any proposal to use capital, IP or other asset as owned by the Company is determined as a Fundamental Transaction and must pass through the complete Official Proposal Process as described in Article VI.1 - VI.1.3. Exceptions to this rule may be made whereby a proposal designates the use of Capital, IP or other Asset to be distributed to a pre-established and precedented objective. In these instances proposals may proceed straight to an On-Chain Proposal to be put to vote.\n\nARTICLE VI (NEW)\nDOPE DAO GOVERNANCE MECHANISM\nVl.1 Official Proposal Process. The Official Proposal Process for any new order of business that relates to the functioning of the DAO shall begin with an \"Off-Chain Proposal\".

The On-Chain voting mechanism shall count votes that represent owned DOPES and delegated votes, the voting period must last a minimum of 120 hours. The On-Chain vote is an automated majority pass function once a threshold of 500 affirming votes has been met.\n\nVI.2 Fundamental Transactions. Any proposal to use capital, IP or other asset as owned by the Company is defined as a Fundamental Transaction and must pass through the complete Official Proposal Process as described in Article VI.1 - VI.1.3. Exceptions to this rule may be made whereby a proposal designates the use of Capital, IP or other Asset to be distributed to a pre-established and precedented objective. In these instances proposals may proceed straight to an On-Chain Proposal to be put to vote.\n\nThis concludes the proposed changes.\n\nTLDR: \n\nProtocol Management, not Member Management.\n\n3 DOPES to initiate Proposals, not 5. Quorum of 500 and minimum time 120hrs.\n\nTani",

      "title": "DIP-79 Dope Frenzy",
      "content": "# Project Overview\n\nDope Frenzy was created on a self-funded budget with no initial funding from DOPE DAO. The game was developed as a way to support the DopeWars ecosystem and showcase the potential of using NFTs and the $PAPER token in a fun and interactive game. The team collaborated with a game studio to design an engaging single-player game where players could destroy parts of the city to gain points. However, the team soon realized that the game lacked the engagement needed to bring users together, so they incorporated a battle-royale style event where players could compete against each other for points that could be later claimed for $PAPER or other reward incentives.\n\nUnixLabs plans to add a Web3 component so that players will be able to log in with their wallets and choose to either pay in $PAPER to join the 10min tournament rounds or play against others with real gear on the line (utilizing a player vs player theft protocol). This will enhance the ecosystem through integrations for drug NFTs, weapons, and other items. \n\nFor the current Frenzy website the game so far created, and the improvement and mods as described in this proposal, Unix seeks funding as described below payable in OP tokens. UnixLabs proposes an even 50/50 split in revenue generated from the game back to the DAO. Unix will maintain the website and game to make sure things are stable. UnixLabs are now a large holder of DOPE and are an important part of the DopeWars community. Their main goal is to make the game as fun as possible and increase the use cases for the L2 Gear items on Optimism and the $PAPER token on Optimism. This proposal will also include the usage of OP player incentive tokens. The creation of Dope Frenzy has become a passion project for UnixLabs who strongly believe in the vision of DopeWars, this is evidenced by the large body of work that has already been self funded and undertaken.  Moreover, the team sees Dope Frenzy as a bridge to the Web3 world. Crypto and crypto gaming's problem has always been how to gain interest from traditional web2 players. This will be kept in mind and best tried to deliver. The project will stay open to incorporating assets from the RYO On-Chain game from Cartridge provided that a bridge back to Optimism is created.\n\nUnixLabs are excited to trailblaze this exciting initiative which aims to realize the successful fusion of a DAO (DOPE DAO) and a Commercial Business (UnixLabs) in a way that achieves maximum potential by amplifying the strengths and mitigating the limitations of each entity. As part of UnixLabs commitment to transparency and collaboration with the DopeWars community, we plan to provide fortnightly updates via media and voice group calls with the Dope Labs team throughout the entire improvement process. This way, everyone can stay up-to-date on our progress and give feedback or ask questions as we work to make Dope Frenzy even better. We estimate that it will take approximately three months for us to complete the production phase of the upgrade. During this time, we will work tirelessly to integrate Web3 functions and add new features, such as the paid tournament rounds that will last for 10 minutes each. We are confident that the end result will be a truly amazing gaming experience that showcases the potential of NFTs and the $PAPER token in a fun and interactive way, powered by OPTIMISM.\n\nCyberbitz has been an integral part of the creation of Dope Frenzy, a lot of his time and resources have gone into making the current development. Cyberbitz will continue to act as Project Manager and liaison for the development of Dope Frenzy ensuring that the the project maintains it’s important link with the DopeWars community providing that feedback loop. This project was dreamed up by Cyberbitz and only made possible by an initial 15k USD investment made by Cyberbitz. This money was paid up front out of Cyber’s personal funds and this proposal will seek to repay that debt. The 15k USD up front payment from Cyber allowed UnixLabs an opportunity to start work and allowed the project to develop into a passion project for UnixLabs as well. The current Beta status of Dope Frenzy represents a value much higher than what this 15k initial payment (and even the amount described below in the Beta release funding request) would normally buy.  As part of the community UnixLabs are looking to contribute valuably and collectively. \n\n## Components & Responsibilities\n\n1. Upgrading Dope Frenzy: UnixLabs is responsible for upgrading the current beta version of Dope Frenzy with better graphics, additional non-playable characters (NPCs), a game lobby, a web3 component, and an enhanced vehicle system.\n2. Maintaining the website and game: UnixLabs is responsible for maintaining the website and game to ensure they are stable.\n3. Liaising between parties: Cyberbitz is responsible for liaising between parties in a Product Management role.\n4. Providing player incentives: A pool of 15,000 OP tokens will be allocated as player incentives to be included in an appropriate way once Dope Frenzy is ready.\n5. Providing transparency and collaboration: UnixLabs and Cyberbitz are responsible for providing fortnightly updates via media and voice group calls throughout the upgrade process to ensure transparency and collaboration with the DopeWars community.\n6. Revenue sharing/ Social Contract: UnixLabs proposes a 50/50 split in all game revenue generated from the DOPE Frenzy back to the DAO.\n7. The code and building infrastructure used to create Dope Frenzy remains property of UnixLabs. DopeWars Intellectual Property remains property of DOPE DAO. \n8. UnixLabs commits to collaboration with DopeWars Community but final decision making for game design rests with UnixLabs. \n9. Collaborations, Project Connections & Grant/Funding options that may become available to  Dope Frenzy shall be an issue that is negotiated between UnixLabs and DOPE DAO, in good faith, as they arise. Often collaboration or project connection opportunities come with associated development costs as well as benefits available. Theses opportunities will be explored in the spirit of transparency, partnership, fairness and mutual benefit as they present. \n10. Additional artwork: Any additional artwork from the Dope Wars artist that might be needed will be billed outside of this proposal.\n\n## 1. Beta\n\n### Overview\n\nThe event is designed in a battle-royale style, where players are pitted against each other in an intense fight for the highest score. The competition is intense, with players having the opportunity to earn points by causing damage to buildings and vehicles, as well as other players or NPCs. To add to the excitement, a wide range of weapons are available for players to use, which randomly spawn on the map. In addition, players have the option to use drugs which grant them special abilities. \n\n### **Scope**\n\n- Use of the DopeWars art assets\n- Multiplayer gameplay\n- Interactive landing page for the game - DopeFrenzy.gg\n- Hustler and starting weapon selection\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Multiplayer game with destructible environment and battle-royale features.\n\n### Funding\n\n- 50k USD payable in OP to UnixLabs\n- 15k USD Payable in OP to Cyber for initial funding\n\n### Acceptance\n\n*DAO members should verify that…*\n\n- Gameplay is smooth and responsive\n- Players can damage buildings and vehicles for points\n- Players can battle each other\n- Players can drive vehicles\n\n## 2. Game Enhancements\n\n### Overview\n\nUpgrade and expand the DopeWars ecosystem by improving the Dope Frenzy gaming experience. The upgrade includes adding better graphics, additional non-playable characters and an enhanced vehicle system.\n\n### **Scope**\n\n- Improved animation - clean up existing visuals and animations\n- Additional NPCs - to fill out the world and provide more interaction with even single players,\n- Improved vehicle system - UnixLabs plans to enhance the vehicle system, providing better vehicle sprites, and even adding a drive-by shooting ability in certain vehicles.\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Upgrade the current beta of Dope Frenzy to a much richer gameplay experience.\n- Add better graphics and additional NPC’s to fill out the world and provide more interaction with even single players.\n- Enhance the vehicle system, providing better vehicle sprites, and even adding a drive-by shooting ability in certain vehicles.\n\n### Funding\n\n20k USD Payable in OP\n\n### Acceptance\n\n*DAO members should verify that…*\n\n- Animations are clean and well designed\n- Improved vehicle sprites and additional features\n\n## 3. Web3 Integration\n\n### Overview\n\nPlayers will be able to log in with their wallets, a feature that allows them to easily access the game platform. Once logged in, they will have the option to pay in $PAPER to join the 10min tournament rounds or play against other players using real gear. Playing against other players with real gear on the line adds a new level of excitement and risk. This feature utilizes a “player vs player theft protocol”, which ensures that the game is fair and secure for all players involved. With these two options available, players can choose the one that best suits their preferences and play style.\n\n### **Scope**\n\n- pay in $PAPER to join the 10min tournament rounds\n- play against others with real gear on the line (utilizing a player vs player theft protocol).\n- The OP funds allocated for Player incentives should also be implemented. An initial pool of 15,000 OP tokens can be allocated to be distributed as game play incentives. The best way (and most fun way) to achieve this will be established by UnixLabs in conjunction with input from the Community under the Management of Cyberbitz. These tokens will remain with the DAO until Dope Frenzy is ready to distribute them.\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Add a web3 component so that players will be able to log in with their wallets and choose to either pay in $PAPER to join the 10min tournament rounds or play against others with real gear on the line (utilizing a player vs player theft protocol).\n\n### Funding\n\n25k USD Payable in OP\n\nInitial 15,000 OP for game incentives.\n\n### Acceptance\n\n*DAO members should verify that…*\n\n- Players are able to connect with their wallets and pay with paper per round\n- Players are able to connect and play with NFT’s on the line via the player Vs player theft protocol.\n- OP incentives for winning rounds or tournaments\n\n## 4. Player lobby\n\n### Overview\n\nThe game lobby is an important feature that allows players who are already logged in to search for others to join in with. This feature is essential for creating a fun and engaging experience for everyone involved. By providing a platform for players to interact with one another, the game lobby helps to build a sense of community among gamers. \n\n### **Scope**\n\n- Provide a game lobby where players who are logged in will be able to search for others to join in with.\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Lobby to display created games ready to start\n\n### Funding\n\n15k USD Payable in OP\n\n### Acceptance\n\n*DAO members should verify that…*\n\n- Players are able to join a game lobby and see other players waiting for the round to begin.\n\n### Funding via Trusted Partner Protocol\n\nAs described in the updated RAPID process, DOPE DAO accounts for Trusted Developers/Partners to have a certain status with regard to payment. This is especially important for this project because UnixLabs, as a commercial business, will have defined financial parameters that need to be set before the tasks can be properly planned and initiated. Like mentioned above UnixLabs are significant DOPE holders with proven deliverables as well as being doxed developers with a high reputation to uphold. For this reason the team seeks approval that, if this proposal receives a successful vote, the entire allotment of funding (excluding player OP incentives) be transferred to a (transparently observable) UnixLabs Developer wallet (Cookie Jar) to be stabled. This will provide certainty and secure runway for the work. Once funds are located in the ‘Cookie Jar’ UnixLabs will be entitled to remove funds from the Cookie Jar as described below:\n\n1. 100% allotment (65k USD) as described above in **BETA** upon completion of a successful vote through the DOPE DAO Official Proposal Process. \n2. 50% allotment (10k USD) as described above in **GAME ENHANCEMENTS** upon initiation of work. 50% allotment (10k USD) upon completion of deliverables. \n3. 50% allotment (12.5k USD) as described above in **WEB3 INTEGRATION** upon initiation of work. 50% allotment (12.5k USD) upon completion of deliverables.\n4. 50% allotment (7.5k USD) as described above in ************************PLAYER LOBBY************************ upon initiation of work. 50% allotment (7.5k USD) upon completion of deliverables.\n\nFaithfully \n\nUnixLabs",

      "title": "DIP-77 DOPE DAO EMI Debit Card",
      "content": "GM DOPE DAO\n\nDOPE DAO currently has platforms like [Dopewars.gg](http://Dopewars.gg) and YouTube that are being hosted by individual Members and then paid for by their personal Credit Cards. Shout out to Faces for doing this for the DAO, we need to relieve him from this burden. Now the DAO is a Legal Entity it can look at having a DAO owned facility. This facility could come in different forms from simple provision of a card that can pay FIAT expenses, to full on Banking set up. The purpose of this DIP is to provide a solution that best suits the DAO’s needs. \n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibgycgwm6dtje6dm3ozuyk4nr3ksusvxdd2t3ap3hosynddfcoqli)\n    \n\n**BANKING**\n\nConducting research into DAO banking I was given a contact to investigate banking options with Western Alliance Bank who have organised bank accounts for DAO’s in the past. Working through their onboarding documents I could see that the process and requirements are quite onerous. See below:\n\n**Needed Information**:\n\n- New Account Application\n- If any signers are **not** listed on the Beneficial Ownership Certification, please also provide their address\n- Beneficial Ownership Certification\n- Complete in its entirety and sign electronically\n- If any individual owners are **not** U.S. citizens, please also provide a copy of their passport and proof of address\n- If any entities are listed, please provide full business name, address, and EIN\n- Operating Agreement\n- Most recent independent audit report\n- Entity Organizational Chart including all intermediary owners (If any entities are listed, please provide legal business name, address, and EIN)\n- Primary Documentary Verification (Articles of Organization, Certificate of Formation, etc.)\n- Pitch deck/presentation materials\n- Audited Financial Statements and/or Tax Returns (if applicable)\n- State specific document certifying business name (if applicable)\n- List of foreign jurisdictions the business transacts in and a copy of all foreign licenses and registrations (if applicable)\n- List of virtual and fiat currencies the business transacts in or permits to be traded on its platform (if applicable)\n- Copy of any written policy, procedure, or control in place for monitoring the digital currency trading activity (if applicable)\n- Previous three months bank statements (if applicable)\n- KYC AML Policy/Program (if applicable)\n- FinCEN MSB Registration (if applicable)\n- Any State and Foreign MTLs (if applicable)\n\nThis list is not impossible to achieve, but perhaps it is not required for DOPE DAO at this time. The full range of banking facilities might not be needed.\n\n**ELECTRONIC MONEY INSTITUTION**\n\nAn EMI is a type of financial institution that facilitates digital transactions on behalf of clients. Typically they offer fewer services than a traditional type Bank, but they can be opened quicker with less onerous onboarding requirements. Potentially, a Debit Card provided by an EMI would be suffice for DOPE DAO’s requirements. Upon recommendation from MIDAO I was given a contact with a group called Cavenwell Group. [https://cavenwellgroup.com/https://cavenwellgroup.com/](https://cavenwellgroup.com/) . This organisation facilitates the set up of such accounts. \n\nDetails:\n\n- Cavenwell Group would charge $1000.00 USD to set up such a card, only payable on successful completion. No set up of a card then no cost.\n- With this facility an account would be opened in the name of the DAO with an EMI, that issues a physical or virtual USD or EUR card. Physical delivery of the card could be at the registered office in Marshall Islands. The card details could be shared securely or you could access the virtual card in a portal.\n- The account can be funded with ETH, which you can then exchange in the wallet to fiat EUR/USD which the card will be linked too.\n- There's no further ongoing fees from Cavenwell Group, but there will be transactional based fees on the card. These are between $20-$90 to issue/deliver the card, and then 0.95% - 1.5% for conversion/payments.\n- There will likely be the requirement that one Member would have to KYC. It would make sense that I could do this seeing as I have already completed KYC with MIDAO.\n- Cavenwell have put together a proposal that would authorise them to begin the process of getting a card with an EMI. See link here: [https://go.ignitionapp.com/client-portal/e0e8a5ba0de4be5c33cbb0a482d0779460ffec61ab65f32e6a9ba2725ea0666fc8d403b745a68e12f0c86d7436/proposal/prop_mrdepfg7me3aahialria/option/propscen_mrdepfg7me3aahialrjq/message](https://go.ignitionapp.com/client-portal/e0e8a5ba0de4be5c33cbb0a482d0779460ffec61ab65f32e6a9ba2725ea0666fc8d403b745a68e12f0c86d7436/proposal/prop_mrdepfg7me3aahialria/option/propscen_mrdepfg7me3aahialrjq/message)\n- There shouldn't be any issues with using this for Saas type subscriptions, from a vendors perspective it's just a normal debit card as you would have personally.\n\nI feel as though the DAO does not currently need a bank account. Obtaining a card through an EMI with Cavenwell Group could fulfil our needs. A Debit card will be easier to manage, operating pre paid will be less risk for the DAO and a system like this will be easier to hand over between DopeLabs Members as they interchange over time.  Therefor this proposal seeks confirmation that we should sign and accept the proposal that Cavenwell Group has provided. They will then canvass EMI Card options and if they are successful in establishing one for the DAO, then receive payment as described in the proposal. \n\nFor you consideration DOPE DAO.\n\n    \n\nTani.",

      "title": "DIP-74 Governance Gas Reclaim",
      "content": "GM DOPE DAO\n\nWe believe it is important to acknowledge and reimburse all those who have made efforts to progress DOPE DAO through the Governance Process. Many members have spent significant amounts of ETH progressing the DAO. As well as this we think it is important to clearly describe the process that will protect the DAO’s governance process in times ahead; especially when we will be again subject to periods of high GAS exposure.\n\n## RECLAIM:\n\nDopeLabs has come up with a method to reclaim GAS that is fair and will stand up to audit. We have worked through all 70 odd proposals and manually added up the GAS used for Proposing, Queuing and Executing proposals. The reclaim will not include any GAS used for voting. It would be too subjective to attempt to establish the difference between community voting and delegation voting. The values of ETH used for Proposing, Queuing and Executing, as shown on Etherscan, will be returned to the wallets it came from. This will ‘clean the slate’ in a fair and transparent way so we can thereon establish a fair protocol for future GAS Governance issues. You will see the table attached that displays this manual calculation. \n\n## OPP:\nThe set-up of the Official Proposal Process (OPP) was designed to maximise democratic value, maintain governance integrity **and** protect our governance mechanism during times when GAS expense may hinder our ability to have an effective system. The key is that the real voting happens during the OFF CHAIN Vote - At this time Snapshot. The OFF CHAIN mechanism is free and it only counts DOPE that you own. This makes it a true representation of 1 DOPE = 1 VOTE. \n\nThen as per the OPP, the ON CHAIN proposal must be the same as the OFF CHAIN Proposal. The ON CHAIN vote is still an integral part of the process. In many cases it is required (practically) to release funds from the treasury via input of executable code. In all cases it is a means by which to stamp our governance acts on chain and forever record our process in an immutable way. Always, when viewed as part of the whole OPP, it is a fail safe way to protect the DAO from random acts of Governance (or directorship) that would be open to a DAO that did not have a mechanism such as this. This is why even with distribution of OP Grant funds, which are held in a MultiSig, the DAO must still complete the entire OPP before any funds can be manually released. Not only does this protect the integrity of the governance process but it also protects the Members on the MultiSig from any incidents, perceived or real, of misappropriation. \n\n## DELEGATES:\n\nHow many Members would be keen to spend $50 USD to vote a proposal through that releases funds each month to cover DAO Operational Expenses like Website hosting costs? We have a ON CHAIN Quorum requirement of 500 votes before the vote will pass and release funds from the treasury. If larger DOPE holders become tired of spending so much ETH on GAS this could mean that it might take a lot of Members to get the proposal over quorum. Say for example 50 Members with 10 DOPE’s - I’ve made the math simple for my smol brain.. it’s a big number. Even if it’s $5 per vote, that is still $250 USD just to execute a business as usual transaction. So we can see why it is an important part of the system to have delegate voters. Remembering that the real voting has already happened OFF CHAIN and the ON CHAIN proposal must be the same, in most cases it is just an administrative function to punch in the executable code and use delegates to get the vote above quorum. This could currently be as little as 2 delegates required to achieve the result. \n\n## FUTURE:\n\nFor any future GAS reclaims we propose that delegates can claim GAS if they are voting, on behalf of the DAO, to get a proposal that has passed the OFF CHAIN stage, past quorum ON CHAIN. This is not to suggest that Members cannot vote whenever it pleases them, just that Members who vote where delegates vote the proposal past quorum cannot reclaim.\n\nWe suggest that a Proposer can reclaim gas if they are putting up a Proposal as a sponsor for the community, or for a proposal that is in the interest of the DAO only. Think for example the recent Arrakis Liquidity proposal or a proposal to release funds for standard operating costs. If a proposal is put up that benefits the proposer, then they should either account for gas in their proposal or absorb the cost. The way the OPP is designed, and the above, is the best way we can think of to have a system that will actually work to allow the community to vote on what it wants at all times even when GAS can be as high as 100 GWEI. Until such a time when DOPE DAO can look at L2 Governance, whatever that might look like and if it ever eventuates.\n\n## TLDR:\n\nThis proposal will vote to authorise the abovementioned GAS Reclaim to ‘clean the slate’ and to set a baseline protocol for any future GAS Reclaims that pertain to DAO Delegate Voting and Sponsored Proposing.\n\n### The following wallets will have their gas expenses reimbursed for a total of 1.237385808 in ETH\n\n| Wallet| ETH |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0x440daa861400bf754b83121479bf26895f1df7c4 | 0.132415507 |\n| 0x50258a2ae0b3065754936828cd7814731c6fc008 | 0.001953583 |\n| 0xa2de2d19edb4094c79fb1a285f3c30c77931bf1e | 0.217754323 |\n| 0xb79c3dbe11fd600032c8d100ac8cc87ed49a0320 | 0.009646477 |\n| 0xba740c9035ff3c24a69e0df231149c9cd12bae07 | 0.226679075 |\n| 0xc2407b34b19d2227addc5c6eae5c5d99432a0c99 | 0.015364474 |\n| 0xced10840f87a2320fdca1dbe17d4f8e4211840a8 | 0.193570069 |\n| 0xd4b65db36026ddf08859b8175c02c611fde0a020 | 0.373462886 |\n| 0xe8d848debb3a3e12aa815b15900c8e020b863f31 | 0.010452977 |\n| 0xf8c3875bfa461a38532fedf90453985901c55114 | 0.014154154 |\n| 0x0331969e189d63fbc31d771bb04ab44227d748d8 | 0.041932283 |\n| Total | 1.237385808 |\n\nFor a full list of the transactions see the proposal in notion\nhttps://dope-wars.notion.site/DIP-74-Governance-Gas-Reclaim-5e801f621c1d4b39a13cce1423775929\n\nDopeLabs Crew",

      "content": "I propose cancelling the funds for DIP-72 ETH Global Tokyo as I have come to realize that the event was not the ideal platform to promote our Dopewars project. As it was primarily a hackathon for developers to showcase their skills and win prizes, many attendees were preoccupied with their own projects and not open to discussions about Dopewars.\nTo avoid any perception of shilling, I refrained from approaching attendees during the event and instead ventured to hip hop clubs and venues with traditional web2 games. There, I engaged with regular people, gave away Dopewars merchandise, and captured great footage and interest. However, as it was not quite how I anticipated I believe it should not be charged to the DAO.\nBy proposing the cancellation of these funds, I hope to ensure a clear record of my decision and prevent any future misunderstandings about fund allocation. Our time in Tokyo was still productive, and the footage we captured can be put to good use for marketing purposes",

      "title": "Concerns and Recommendations for Dopewars Project",
      "content": "We have been closely monitoring the developments of the Dopewars project since its inception. We note that the initial excitement surrounding the free mint quickly subsided, with Dennison and Tarrance, two of the founders, minting heavily and holding a substantial portion of the DOPE Governance token supply in various wallets.\n\nFollowing the secondary sales, which injected more ETH into the DAO treasury, the community expressed a desire to know what the next steps would be for the project. The DAO, influenced by large DOPE holders, subsequently decided to create $Paper, an \"in-game token\" that could be claimed by all DOPE holders. It is noteworthy that the original founders who had minted the DOPE token across multiple wallets were also the largest holders of $Paper.\n\nWe acknowledge the contribution of Mr Fax, who submitted impressive artwork that was well-received by the community as an excellent representation of the nostalgic game. However, despite additional proposals for improvements, including music, swap meets, and MMO development, the game remains non-functional, with no integrations with other projects.\n\nMoreover, despite the significant amount of funds that the DAO has disbursed to pixel artists, music, and developers, we note with concern that there has been no significant progress towards a functioning game or a Roll your Own \"RYO\" arbitrage game.\n\nIn light of the treasury's low ETH balance and the lack of an \"in-game token\" to reward future contributors, the community proposed the minting of more $Paper tokens to replenish the treasury and provide the \"in-game token\" to any future investors or contributors. While this proposal received widespread support from DOPE holders, the decision was made without conducting adequate research. Subsequently, it was found that Dopewars would be violating security laws by selling any of their freshly minted tokens. This dilution of supply without any direction led to trading members of $Paper selling off their heavily diluted tokens with zero gameplay or any plan for the future.\n\nDespite this setback, Dopewars was able to secure funding based on community activity and usage of the Optimism network. However, we note that there is cause for concern regarding the proposal for more artwork by Mr Fax to start building a new 3D type of character for a StarkNet chain with a completely different contract to the original DOPE. While it is stated that no funds will be required from the DAO treasury as it is a pay-to-mint project, given the project's history, caution is warranted.\n\nWe strongly advise that the focus be on completing and delivering the product as soon as possible, as funds have already been spent on 2D artwork assets, maps, music and other elements. While new mints may provide additional liquidity, they could harm Dopewars in the long run.\n\nIt is also essential to be aware of the absence of Tarrance, who claimed to be developing the RYO arbitrage game on StarkNet but is now working on Cartridge. There is currently no evidence of the arbitrage game being implemented on Cartridge.\n\nFurthermore, we observe that the founders/developers who proposed the idea of claimable $Paper for unbundled DOPE have since sold all their $Paper without providing any value or use cases. This has left many feeling exploited, with the sudden liquidity dump exacerbating the situation. The lack of action is evident in the $Paper charts. However, we note that the founders/developers would not have been able to sell their tokens if the community had not expressed interest in buying them.\n\nFinally, it is vital to be mindful of large DOPE holders who may try to influence votes for their benefit. We believe that an honest vote will provide clarity on the project's direction, allowing the community to decide whether to remain part of the organization. We hope this information receives adequate exposure so that the community can make informed decisions.\n\nDo you think that the organization should prioritize the development of the initial RYO game, which was the original goal, over diverting and diluting resources and interest towards the creation of more 3D art assets? This could lead to unnecessary spending on digital art and potentially delay the completion of the RYO game.\n",

      "content": "So here's the deal: we need to acquire a .dope TLD. It's perfect for our brand and community.\n\n## Proposal Overview\n\nI had a chat with a Punk Domains Punk about the process for Dope Wars in acquiring our very own Web3 *top-level domains (TLD) on Optimism….*  These domains can generate revenue for our operations. \n\nThis proposal is requesting Dope Wars DAO to fund an initiative in acquiring the Web3 domain **.dope**\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidgjdybwzryfzfdctpcroxfrdyb5owo6znvtryh6pjma2oilhx2iu) https://blog.punk.domains/posts/domains-for-daos/\n\n\n## This is the basic process\n\n1. We decide what is the TLD Dope Wars would want to have? \n2. With a one-time fixed fee of 5k DAI in ETH, Punk domains team would set up the contracts, minting website and set everything up including integrate our TLD into all existing tools like Send2.name etc.\n3. *Here's where it gets interesting* - DWs gets 80% of the mint fees and royalties from secondary sales, with the remaining 20% going to the Punk Domains DAO. \n4. We would set the pricing, offer pre-mints etc. Mint can also be token gated with Dope Wars integration,, so eg you’ll need a HUSTLER to mint a .dope domain [we could possibly pair this up with a campaign to spread the word that HUSTLERS ARE A FREE MINT! and another example we could set pre-mint period to only allow addresses that hold a min of 1 of each asset… GEAR, PAPER, DOPE and HUSTLER  to mint during pre-mint\n\nOf course, there are some minor hurdles we need to deal with - \na) We'll need someone with Admin access to manage our TLD \nb) Punk Domains Protocol is open source so integration of our HUSTLERS and/or GEAR would have to be done by a Dope dev contributor.\n\n[https://punk.domains/#/how](https://punk.domains/#/how)\n\n## ROI\n\nCost $5000 + Dev contribution\nExcluding the developer contributions, the expected ROI based on ETH at $1850 would cost DW 2.7 ETH. Assuming a mint price of 0.01 ETH per .dope domain, DW DAO would receive 0.008 ETH for each domain minted. We would only need 338 registered domains. After that point, there would be a external revenue stream flowing into the treasury in the form of ETH from new domain mints and secondary sale royalties. \nfor $20 example … DOPE DAO will receive $16 every mint, requiring 313 mints \nfor $15 example … DOPE DAO will receive $12 every mint, requiring 417 mints \n\n**The details are up for discussion and will be finalized by Tally vote**\n\n## Decisions to be made by the DAO\n**1. choosing a TLD?**   .dope \n**2. deciding on mint price?**  *It is recommended by Punk DAO to set a high enough price to avoid spamming and squatting.*\n    \n    Examples of other domains…\n    - .op  Domain price: 0.01 ETH -Mints To Date (MTD) 1190 - Holders 493 [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xC16aCAdf99E4540E6f4E6Da816fd6D2A2C6E1d4F](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xC16aCAdf99E4540E6f4E6Da816fd6D2A2C6E1d4F)\n    \n    -.l2  Domain price: 0.025 ETH - MTD 1327 - Holders 1015 [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x9A7657d1593032C75d70950707870c3cC7ca45DC](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x9A7657d1593032C75d70950707870c3cC7ca45DC)\n    \n    - .wagmi  Domain price: 0.014 ETH -MTD 230 - Holders 168 [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xC3E8922657686EC63eaaa9FC1Fe06826802e7e0f](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xC3E8922657686EC63eaaa9FC1Fe06826802e7e0f)\n    \n    - .smol   from their website “A smol domain costs 39.99 magic adjusted overtime to always be near or under $20.” -MTD 4320 - Holders 1628 [https://arbiscan.io/token/0xe0d972817e94c5ff9bdc49a63d8927a0ba833e4f](https://arbiscan.io/token/0xe0d972817e94c5ff9bdc49a63d8927a0ba833e4f)\n    \n**3. deciphering which token to use for mint?**  ETH-PAPER-USDC\n    \n    Pros and Cons\n    -ETH would be the easiest UE and is a liquid asset which the DAO could easily use for expenses\n\n    -both ERC-20 tokens ‘PAPER’ and ‘USDC’ will require users to approve the token to mint for their first domain name.(Optimism tx are cheap so its not a major factor).\n\n    -PAPER would add another utility for our token but would also leave the DAO with more PAPER which we have a sufficient amount already\n\n    -USDC would be a great option in mitigating the need to stable our ETH in treasury but we all saw some stables break peg 👀 prob won't happen again🤷‍♂️ \n    \n4. decide what Dope Integration we wanna use as the requirement for minting eg you need a HUSTLERS to mint…\n5. possibly decide on pre mint.. \n6. @Bort has confirmed he is keen to do the in-house dev work. Once we iron out all the details above, he can give us an estimate on cost.\n\n\n\n\nSo what do you say, Hustlers?

      "title": "DIP-75: Dope World + Roll Your Own",
      "content": "![](https://i.ibb.co/W3nh2nx/dopeworld.png)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Cartridge team proposes to seed the Dope Wars Autonomous World on Starknet and to build ‘Roll Your Own’ on top of it.\n\n### Autonomous World\n\nAutonomous Worlds are modular, interoperable, and permissionlessly expansible onchain universes for games. The Dope Wars Autonomous World will provide a robust foundation for growth of the ecosystem.\n\nLeveraging the [Dojo toolchain for Autonomous Worlds](http://dojoengine.org/), the Cartridge team will seed the Dope World through the creation of a canonical world contract and development of components and systems to represent Dope Wars hustlers, items, and paper. These characters and items will provide the foundation on top of which the ecosystem can be expanded, through the introduction of additional components and systems that interoperate with them.\n\nThe specifics of world expansion are left to a future publication.\n\n### Roll Your Own\n\nRoll Your Own will serve as the first \"mod\" of the Dope World. Roll Your Own is an on-chain adaptation of the original Drug Wars game. As in the original, players will land in Dope Wars locations, arbitraging the price of drugs in an attempt to stack paper and own the streets.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MbWBpkM.png)\n\nRYO extends the core game mechanic of arbitraging drugs in different neighborhoods to a multiplayer environment where each player’s actions affect the in-game economy, creating a competitive and evolving environment. During each turn, a player will travel to a neighborhood, review the current market prices for drugs, and decide to Buy or Sell. After each turn is complete, the market prices will be affected by the previous player’s turn, adding a new layer of strategy to the game. Random events affect prices between turns to avoid making the game too deterministic.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nSeeding the Dope World and implementing Roll Your Own is an ambitious endeavor. Since the original implementation by @perama, the Starknet ecosystem has evolved significantly and everything will need to be rewritten. Through our work at Cartridge and Dojo, we believe the platform is finally in a state where such an ambitious project can be successfully brought to life.\n\nProvided below is a more detailed set of technical requirements necessary to enable this. Please note these are rough and are subject to change as we journey down the path together.\n\n### Initial Seeding\n\nThe Dope Wars ecosystem is currently comprised of hustlers, items, and paper which will serve as the foundation for the world.\n\nThese assets will need code developed in order to represent them on Starknet and in the Dope World. A set of Components and Systems will be created to enable this. Currently, PAPER exists on Ethereum Mainnet, a bridge will be provided to make it available on Starknet.\n\nHustlers and Items (acquired through the unbundling of DOPE tokens) currently exist on Optimism, a bridge will be developed to claim the corresponding characters and items in the Dope World.\n\n**NOTE:** In this process, we propose to remediate some issues in the existing Dope Wars item set, namely, duplicate items (such as coke and cocaine), translation of real world brand names into Dope World native brands, mapping of the original location set to a more coherent set. This is vital to ensure the long term success of the ecosystem.\n\nSeeding the Dope World can happen in parallel to the Roll Your Own development but is resource constrained on the Cartridge side. We are likely to sequence this after the Roll Your Own Alpha.\n\n### Roll Your Own\n\nCreation of the Roll Your Own game will involve a sequential iterative process with thorough opportunity for experimentation and feedback.\n\n#### Alpha\n\nA minimal viable game, enabling players to spawn into a round, travel between locations, trade product, and stack cash.\n\nThe alpha version of the game will not incorporate hustlers, items, or paper. It will serve as an opportunity to test and iterate on the core game loop.\n\nAlpha will be deployed to testnet and available for testing through a web ui.\n\n*ETA: May/June*\n\n#### Beta\n\nExtension of the Alpha version, incorporating player feedback into the game loop. Introduction of **Hustlers**, **Items**, and **Lobbies**.\n\n**Lobbies** are akin to \"servers\" in traditional gaming, a configuration of the RYO game. For example a lobby host can configure parameters such as round duration, turn system, starting stash, max players, etc.\n\n**Items** will have stats that influence gameplay. For example, rocking an ak47 could make you slow, less likely to be mugged, and more likely to be chased by the cops. In this iteration, hustlers will be able to select a loadout before joining a lobby.\n\nBeta will be deployed on testnet and available for testing through a web and mobile ui.\n\n*ETA: September/October*\n\n#### Mainnet\n\nMainnet deployment of the Roll Your Own on top of Dope World. This version will incorporate mainnet item ownership. Buy in to rounds with PAPER, use your hustler and items to win the streets, and take home the prize pool.\n\n*ETA: TBD*\n\n## Compensation\n\nCartridge proposes the following compensation to support development costs and participate in the Dope World. PAPER will be vested over 1 year from the date of delivery of the milestone. \n\n**Seeding Dope World**     - 25M PAPER\n**Roll Your Own Alpha**    - 10m PAPER\n**Roll Your Own Beta**     - 15m PAPER\n**Roll Your Own Mainnet**  - 25m PAPER\n\n## Intellectual Property\n\nAll code to be developed for this project, that is not part of the Cartridge platform offering, will be CC0 or MIT or similarly licensed open source code upon completion of this engagment.\n\n## Future Work\n\nThere are many exciting opportunities to expand and extend Dope World and Roll Your Own through mods. The goal of this proposal is the lay the foundations on top of which the future can be built. Future contributors can introduce new game types and configurations, introduce new items, locations, random events, and market dynamics.\n\nFuture governance of the Dope World is an area that has exciting potential. The idea that the parameters for Dope World could eventually be governed by players within the ecosystem. This could be achieved by using something like streetcred where voting power is earned over time through participation. \n\nPaper's role in the Dope World economy is outside the scope of this proposal. This proposal will make it available on Starknet through bridging. It will also set the foundations whereby a game mode could be developed so paper can be contributed to the prize pool for a round. Deeper integrations like this are left for the future.",

      "title": "DIP-69 StarkNet briq Hustler Collection",
      "content": "Mrfax and I propose that we build a collection of 250 unique DOPEWARS 3D Hustlers on briq, see https://briq.construction/\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiglrghke543ek5woaqn4vwto3pv6txltcrsda5rpzeiiwpe7f75ym)\n    \nbriq is a NFT ‘matter’ building application running on StarkNet Mainnet. They recently released a very successful collection called ‘Ducks Everywhere’, see https://briq.construction/product/ducks_everywhere\nbriq works similarly to a construction game; anything built with briq is an NFT (called a set). If you disassemble your set you get your briqs back and you can build something new. This allows for the building of highly composable assets very easily.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicq5rcyi4m6d75pxm6bsegtq6lbhestc2dl5fv4yhwihxdzbe2dge)\n    \nThe idea is that we collect input from the community about what hustlers we create. For example, many Members might want their unique Hustler to be recreated and available for purchase. We will allocate a portion of the collection, beginning at 50-100 depending on interest, available for Members to create their hustler on SwapMeet for Mrfax to recreate on briq. See below examples of what this might look like:\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreieetuoyist37t5mnz2sshvv37oyzm5qe7a5opc5buzvl6lzxnfnpm)\n    \nWe will make approximately 25 special characters. There are some awesome characters that have grown from DOPELORE like the legendary Silky Ledger. Other characters might look like the examples below:\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreib65skl66cph5cnoh2lkk2mrn5ptz7lpnsf5mqdtywh4iaacuqusi)\n    \nThe possibilities are exciting, we could do a StarkNet Hustler, the Godfather, Tony Montana, Wu Tang Clan, or notable Crypto people like the Vitalik Hustler. The community can also provide input on the development of special characters.\n\nThe remainder of the collection will be generated by Mrfax. With the collection complete, these NFTs would live on StarkNet, in their own collection contract.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiaujylxohxkgeze4rw7chrnkwsk7mn3utb7x6bz4mi7ikz45cpwzu)\n    \nNuts and Bolts:\n•\tbriq will take 20% of revenue to set this all up and facilitate the auction. The sales will take place on MintSquare https://mintsquare.io/starknet\n•\tProject creators will take 75% of revenue.\n•\tThe proposal would be constructed on the basis that 5% of revenue is given back to the DAO as per the Minimum requirement in the DOPE DAO Operating Agreement.\n•\tThis project is not designed to be a massive revenue generator, hence the lowest percentage return. The collection, if it sold out would mostly just cover costs. Mint price will be set at 0.05 ETH. If it sells out that is 12.5 ETH with 20% to briq and 5% to the DAO. Which gives 9.375 ETH or at today’s price $14,700.00 total. These briq Hustlers are quite intensive to make and will occupy Mrfax for approximately 330 hours to build. There will be another estimated 40 hours of administration to get this project complete. Doing the math you can see that this is less than $40 per hour, with no guarantee the project will sell out. The project itself would be cost free for the DAO.\n•\tThe goal of this project would be more of a fun collaboration with briq and StarkNet that could drive some awareness. We have a strong connection with StarkNet and it would be great to do a project like this that we could use to promote DOPEWARS and briq simultaneously. As you all know StarkNet has a very large builders community. We are an Open Forum Builders platform so it would be great for us if we could attract some people to build. DOPEWARS is pixels and briq is blocks of NFT matter, a great fit! As you can see the product Mrfax can produce is DOPE.\n•\tRoyalties would be split three ways between DOPE DAO, briq and Project creators. We can write a contract to ensure this is the case.\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicoxmpsjwczagynoywzh4grpwb5b5quotcwsbb7grexmg4bqmepsi)\n    \nThe Ducks Everywhere collection had good engagement and sold out at the auction. They had a pre-auction allow list sale for people who participated on the Goerli test network. A pre-sale for the StarkNet OG’s. I propose that we include the option of having a pre-auction allow list sale of 50 briq Hustlers available only for DOPEWARS OG holders. Then the auction will go public.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihmdbepgk67ijj5uirvfd3vptrla5lxs4yr7lyyqfkkdcpoovn2qa)\n    \nMrfax could, in the future, develop these briq Hustlers to have corresponding Sprite sheets making it possible that a Developer could grab these unique Hustlers and drop them into a game, or games, think DOPEWARS MMO and Worldwide Webb. The future possibility exits to utilise them in 3D projects like decentraland and sandbox with the appropriate animation.  With the recent work on the StarkNet project Dojo, an on-chain game engine to build composable games, this would be easier to implement.\nhttps://twitter.com/dojostarknet\nLet’s hope this eventuates but remember there are no promises on this front within this proposal. These DOPEWARS briq Hustlers will be purely for collection purposes at this point in time.\nbriq are super pumped on the idea of working with the DOPEWARS Community.\n\n\nAs the Legendary Silky Ledger would say, “Let’s unite and build this shit together”.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreieqzce2lori3s7edzkjdg4ytaowotyytgevq5khr4ipzbwx5nzxzq)\n    \nTaniela & Mrfax.",

For the 8 positions within DOPELABS the maximum total amount of hours billable, at the described rates, amounts to $22800 over 2 months. This equates to 11,176,470 $Paper.\n\nAgain, as the KYC'd Member I will recieve this $Paper and bridge it over to the Layer 2 Optimism Wallet for administration. The requirement to administer from Layer 2 is to avoid expensive Gas fees. \n\nOf course any $Paper that is not billed against will remain in the Multisig and hold over for the next billing period. If the value of $Paper drops below the average we have used now, then we can address this next month. We are starting with small steps at the moment but we can look at methods to expediate this process in the future with perhaps larger more infrequent bridging options. \n\nLFG.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/c494a2d6-2db3-4a49-a8bc-090bf7c670c4_400x400.jpg)\n\n",

      "content": "# Overview\n\nThe proposal aims to fund a trip to Japan to attend the ETH Global Tokyo Event and create a promotional video for the Dope Wars project. The project includes covering the cost of a return ticket to Japan, hotel accommodation, video footage of the event, and an interview with attendees.\n\n## Components & Responsibilities\n\n- The proposer will be responsible for attending the event, creating the video footage, and conducting the interviews.\n- The DAO will be responsible for funding the flight and accommodation costs for the proposer and the interviewer.\n- Neither the interviewer nor Cyberbitz will be compensated for their time spent on tasks related to this project, such as compiling and organizing.\n\n## 1. Interviews and Exposure\n\n### Background\n\nI propose that the DAO fund my trip to Japan for the ETH Global Tokyo Event. The cost of a return ticket is $1200, and I will cover the cost of my hotel during the trip. My plan is to attend the event and take video footage of the event, including the Unixlabs team, which includes five of their developers and two global partners, who are developing Dope Frenzy and will be attending the hackathon.\n\nDuring the event, I also plan to use a female interviewer (No not my Girlfriend lol), to interview people around the event and Tokyo about Dope Wars & Collective games and their general thoughts on the crypto gaming environment. The goal is to create a fun video that showcases a different side of Dope Wars by using a female interviewer who is fun and interactive, making it easier for people to approach and talk to us. We also plan to grab footage of people playing Dope Frenzy, Infiltration & the MMO if ready by then\n\nI have a few other friends attending from their own projects and hope to convince them to wear Dope Wars shirts or play Dope Frenzy and get a reaction. Additionally, we already have existing merch from the last Crypto Event in Bali, which I plan to distribute to others.\n\nI request that the DAO cover the cost of the interviewer's flight and hotel for three days, which is approximately $1350 total. Video editing should cost around $300. I will not charge the DAO for any of my hours spent promoting Dope Wars since it is something I enjoy doing.\n\nMy plan is to spend a week in Japan to ensure that I have enough time to cover the ETH event and capture additional interview footage on the streets\n\nWith this proposal, I aim to show that Dope Wars is still very much alive and kicking. The event will not only provide us with more content but also attract more attention to our project, which could help us in the future. While funding for marketing may not pour directly into the DAO treasury, it will still help raise awareness of the project, and I believe that it is worth investing in.\n\n### Scope\n\nThe proposer will attend the event and film the proceedings, including interviews with attendees and footage of them playing DopeWars. The scope of the project includes the creation of a fun and interactive video that showcases the project and the crypto gaming environment.\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- A promotional video that showcases the Dope Wars project and the ETH Global Tokyo Event\n- Footage of attendees playing Dope Frenzy,& Dope Wars games\n- Interviews with attendees about Dope Wars, and the crypto gaming environment\n- General footage and street vibe with some marketing\n- Distribute existing merchandise from past events.\n\n### Estimates\n\n| Items | Cost |\n| --- | --- |\n| Return flight for Interviewer | $1350 |\n| Hotel cost for the interviewer | $400 |\n| Return flight for Cyberbitz | $1200 |\n| Video editing | $300 |\n| TOTALS | $3250 |\n\n### Acceptance\n\n*DAO members should verify that…*\n\nThe DAO will benefit from this proposal in several ways:\n\n- Exposure: The promotional video and footage of the ETH Global Tokyo Event will provide exposure for the DAO and the Dopewars project, potentially leading to more eyes on the project and increased awareness.\n- Marketing: The video can be used in future marketing efforts to showcase the project and attract more users and investors, as well as for social media purposes.\n- Cost savings: The DAO will only be responsible for the cost of the flights and hotel for the interviewer, as the proposer will cover their own hotel costs and will not charge the DAO for their time spent on promoting Dopewars.\n\nAn example vid can be found in #operation-Unit in discord channel",

      "content": "GM DOPEFAM\n\nSince the Snapshot proposal passed I have had two meetings with the Lawyer to discuss and negotiate terms of retainment. Please see link to Snapshot below:\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0x6acc2bb1d6eb91e764cb748cea0a02141c1b27d2ad764aaa31a6700f0fee4101\n\nThe Terms of Retainment are as below:\n\nThe execution of this Tally vote would authorise the release of $20,000 USD worth of OP to be paid to Thomas Plunkett to retain him as DOPE DAO Legal Counsel. The OP will be converted to stable coin USDC and then paid into a wallet controlled by the Lawyer.\n\n$5,000 would be paid to secure a non refundable 12 month retainment contract. Included in this 12 month retainment is a monthly 30 minute consultation no additional charge. \n\nThe rest would secure $15,000 worth of pre-paid legal fees. These pre paid legal fees can be spent on legal advice at any time, and until such time as any legal counsel is sought this would belong to the DAO. At any time this can be requested to be transferred back to the DAO. If it is not spent on legal advice over the space of the year then the creidt can be either returned to the DAO or remain as pre paid legal fees under a new agreement.\n\nThis represents an agreement that I negotiated to heavily favour the DAO - a leaning this far in favour of pre-paid legal advice is uncommon. Thomas likes the project and understands the fact we are just getting started really. \n\nThis proposal will also authorise the release of 1 DOPE token to be paid to Thomas from the marketing wallet. This would mean that he would become part of the community and part of the DAO. This adds another layer of protection for us. Having a specialist crypto lawyer as part of the DAO. The more he understands DOPE DAO the better we can work together to ensure we are staying above board as best we can in this uncertain landscape. Like I mentioned in the snapshot proposal, one of my next biggest issues will be ensuring that we (hopefully) can execute a future Turf drop in a SAFU way. As well as the many other issues that are going to pop up.\n\nhttps://luckytrader.com/nft/nbatopshot/news/dapper-suit-carries-on \n\nThe last time we had legal issues, the DAO came to a grinding halt as Developers and Contributors became aware of possible issues of liability. This lead to all the work around registration and developing the legal platform. I see this issue as a no-brainer - plus if we dont spend the credit we can get it back!\n\nKind regards\nTani ",

      "title": "DIP-59 DopeWars Turf Builder",
      "content": "# Project Overview\n\nFor a full technical description of the project, please check the whitepaper that HPMNK wrote for it between August 22 / September 22.\n\n[Documentation (Main) ](https://www.notion.so/Documentation-Main-5a1c23979fa7453ebab0f0919ff648ee)\n\n## General Description\n\nDOPEWARS Turf Builder is a game-tool built on Optimism that would enable buildings to be built in the DOPEWARS Metaverse. Buildings would be filled with default furniture and there would be the option to acquire new furniture in various ways (see Description) to customize the building in the Web3 space.\n\nDope Wars Turf Builder could potentially be a way for Dope Wars to make interoperable partnerships with others Play and Own Games such as Webb3, Crypto Raiders etc.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Specs\n\nBuilt as a service within DOPE Monorepo, it will use the the firebase auth already implemented. \n\nThree.JS + React Three Fiber for Game Dev and Front-end.\n\nSaved on chain + database.\n\nWe are a team of 2 developer + 1 Game Designer.\n\nThomas (johntelman7x7) will be in charge of the development of the game/tool back-end and front-end wise.\n\nIris will be in charge of the UI part of the front-end and the contracts.\n\nHPMNK will be leading the team and will create additional game art for Dope world.\n\n---\n\n## Link with DopeMMO\n\nThe Turf builder is a Level Design Tool that will allows us several things : \n\n- to have a base for Turf Chapter. The builder is more or less a top-down pixel user friendly level design tool. We can expand the tool to allow the creation of wider game elements like streets. One of the main goal we keep in mind while building it is to have a way to allow Dope holders to create streets with us collaboratively, by placing props + their building in a huge world map.\n- allows us to gather cosmetic rewards from using the Dope MMO and contributing to Dope Ecosystem. HPMNK would like to experiment some Quest3 in the near future, and have some fun with GPT to create endless gangsta puns with NPCs. We wanna create rewards that can be transported to other games, and static props are an efficient way to allow that, as you don’t need to integrate a full collection with rarities to have it available in another Game or Dapp.\n\n## From a Web3 Point of View\n\nDOPEWARS Turf Builder tool has the potential to be the best way to bring and organize blockchain assets together. A building, once created, may very well soon become one of the nicest place within GameFi. People would be delighted to come visit and learn about your best hacks and adventures. But it is more that that! Turf Builder is both about showing and sharing gaming assets.\n\n## Showing your assets!\n\nShowing assets out of their original game is the first challenge Turf Builder is looking to address. It is simple enough so that any game can easily provide access to their assets. The simplest integration consists of leaving a 2D tile at the right place. The renderer enhances the display to provide an immersive experience.\n\nIt does not stop here Turf Builder allows the positioning of both 3D assets and animated assets so that you can benefit from the best art-design and benefit from the changes within games.\nIn addition to presenting your assets, Turf Builder organizes them together in a space that you can customised in design.\n\n## Sharing your assets!\n\nSharing assets with and between games is the other challenge Turf Builder is addressing… While most games allow playing with your wallet/account, this approach has many concerns:\n\n- Involving assets from several accounts can not be done.\n- You cannot easily rent or borrow assets.\n- You cannot stake your assets, i.e. games/players cannot get access to your account without an explicit grant.\n\nTo address that issue, Turf are special contracts that could be used by dapps to play. The contract can be granted assets and provide some special abilities. For now:\n\n- An NFT can be added to a building and only one building.\n- There are a set of commitments between the asset and the building. For now, the commitment is that an asset cannot be removed from an building by its owner before a certain time.\n- Any account can lend an NFT to a building for a period of time because, after the period of time, only the providing account will be able to retrieve the NFT.\n\nThose properties will allow users to better share assets, yet make sure they can get them back after a specific period of time.\n---\n## Unique features\n\n### Buy Tiles - Not a Layout\n\nOne of the main features we aim with this tool, is to allow the creation of Tiles instead of a static layout, so the layout can be customised. The contract can be modified later to make the building bigger if that is desired.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreie4cbngpqn7f3l7a6kkutykzwtvfjgptthmuxj553g3tvp7ceb3z4)\n    \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidzpthdujpox76vwg4advxsjwdp4scxw5gzh2gqeyynu7jhtwr5fe)\n    \n\n### Room Creation System\n\nAnother big features is the ability to draw the room within the building, to theme it as desired. Make an building as one single big thrashy room, or make a lot of little ones, as preferred.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiagsw2t7mlnxghy6x7qmndo3ktr754zrxk4p2brxttzzrl66iq2e4)\n    \n### Interoperability\n\nA feature of the DOPEWARS Turf Builder would be the future ability to make partnerships with others games and trade cross-chain and cross-games items. Let’s have an example:\nTake a piece of DOPEWARS furniture, like a 'Grimy Sofa' for example. Then create a Crypto Raiders version of it (fitting with their own artistic direction and resolution) - Take a piece of furniture from Crypto Raiders, convert it to Dope aesthetic, and make this item usable in both games. \n\n### Toward DOPE TURF\n\nOur interior tool will use a tilemap system. This technology could potentially be used in the future as the base for a Turf building tool. Instead of drawing walls and floors, you draw roads and sidewalks, buildings and place props etc. The focus of this proposal is to have the development funded to build the DOPEWARS Turf Builder tool only. These references are only included to highlight some of the future possible utilities this tool could be used for.\n\n---\n\n## Team\n\n### HPMNK @HPMNK : Game Designer / Game Artist / SFX\n\nHPMNK have been working for the whole Dope Wars visual aesthetics since 2021, and been co-creating the Phaser MMO with Larko. During 2022, he designed the interiors for our future metaverse main buildings.\n\nHe will be in charge of the production, and the game assets of the Turf Tool.\n\n(Note: With the previous interiors, we have hundreds of props for you already) \n\n### **Iris @IrisDeVillar : Front-End Developer / Contract Developer**\n\nIris is a 7 year experienced Front Developer who contributed to many blockchain applications, especially on Starknet. She is the co-founder of 42 Entrepreneurs and built Kubri, a bridge for erc-1155 between L1 and Starknet. \n\n### **Thomas @Thomas7x7 : Back End Developer**\n\nThomas is a 10 year C/C++ Game Developer. He is the creator of Time Squared, an Open World FPS game. He is also the founder of FUSIS (software company). \n\n### **Larko @larko : Back End Developer - Cartridge**\n\nLarko created all the features of our MMO games with HPMNK during 2022.

Its creation, the underlying philosophy, structure and more – Notably the wideness of its attraction (street culture meets high end Web3 tech and thought). Crypto Hustle meets Gangster Shuffle. While so many great attributes came together in an exciting way, at the outset, there was no description given to how the community should organise itself to create a great product.\n\nI believe the issue above has been a strength for DOPEWARS up until this time. The lack of historic organisational structure has allowed for a chaotic and creative pool of energy to smash together the super **dope** and **hyper** exciting situation we are now in. And let’s be honest, this organic beast has been like the Hulk at times and the Hulk likes to smash.  The silver lining has been that the lack of traditional structure and remuneration has meant that we have attracted and worked with a very diverse range of people with passion and talent.\n\nNow to the present we must address this issue.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihaky5mfaasovppbn3aaz3dnpdrnrgtd6xqwrj5pb54crrcxrd5fm)\n    \nAt the foundation of DOPE DAO is the DOPE Token, the Treasury and the Smart Contract that binds the two together in immutable harmony. This foundation establishes the Decentralised and Autonomous nature of DOPE DAO. Now we have a codified Purpose of DOPE DAO within the Operating Agreement that binds us to our mission; To create an open forum, equal opportunity builder’s environment for Members to develop and create part of the DOPEWARS Metaverse Community. There are many competing ideas about where and how the DAO will proceed. In truth no one knows exactly where we will go. The reality is that the DAO will go wherever the DOPE flows. This is part of what makes it such an exciting and unique project.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifirkrlr7ql73dvimggfwbxifmftipbp4onu5ck3jhde2fl3rmnhe)\n    \nMuch of DOPEWARS success has relied upon herculean efforts from the community. From the DOPEFATHER down dreaming up this crazy shizzle, giga brain contributors, major financial players, loyal soldiers of the DOPEWARS community including some who lay sacrificed at the altar of frustration. I ain’t gunna lie, this DAO bizzo is difficult. We have had great success collaborating with the wider Web 3 community, networking with other projects and most notably receiving the recent grant from Optimism.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibxzezxrsuohfy22qa2yfpftihwa27iowutvzeqsp2b6i524ha2nu)\n    \nWe have come this far with passion but from hereon there are certain realities we must accept. There is a requirement for an element of organisation and strategy. We have many BAU tasks that require human labour. We have embraced the chaos for long enough and the time has come to organise so as to better reap the rewards of our hustle. In order to achieve this I propose we establish DOPELABS to help define the roles required, outline tasks that need to be completed as routine, and decide upon suitable remuneration for those Members willing and able to perform them. \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibiq7v3selai42tkokockoydmijchkyufd5wdmzznkt2wcj53rynq)\n    \nAs a registered Not for Profit LLC we will have record keeping responsibilities, accounting obligations and legal constraints that need to be considered. We can see the wisdom of effective architectural oversight to ensure essential Tech integration while this ecosystem is being mashed together. We can see the obvious benefits of Community Engagement, DOPE updates, DOPE News, promotions, and collaborations with other projects. In the future we will find tools to help us with certain problems; like having DAO owned Communications Platforms, but for now members must hold accounts. Members must take minutes, Members must account for treasury revenue/expenditure and the list goes on.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigl55rvnqj6vnxtto77grljfiojqkzlhrvy75m4e6q4movlwf7zya)\n    \nI propose we vote in 6 month blocks to fill DOPELABS with Members. As per the Operating Agreement, DOPELABS (CORE UNIT) Members would have no guarantee of their position beyond the 6 month vote and any efforts and IP would belong to the DAO. I envisage that DOPELABS would evolve over time. In this proposal you will notice names are established in positions already because we have grown organically. As we progress new members will step up to contribute to our Member Managed DAO. So perhaps there will be the requirement for preliminary voting etc. in the future. Of course we have solved the issue of creating a $Paper cache for the DAO with the mint and burn proposal, so DOPELABS and DOPEWARS success would be fueled by $Paper.\n\nAs we all know the Devil is in the detail so the details need discussing. The proposed construct of DOPELABS is as below:\n\n**OPERATIONS CORE UNIT**\n\n**OPERATIONS MANAGER** – SPRTN\n\n**Pay Scale:** $50 p/h\n\n**Responsibilities:** \n\n- Management support of collaboration platforms Notion and Discord (roles, access, channels, pages etc.) Ownership of the Discord Community Communication Platform Server until such time that the DAO tools exist to make DAO ownership possible.\n- Tracking of DIP deliverables for payment milestones and acceptance criteria.\n- Tracking of meeting action items and updates.\n- Community updates on DIP tasks, meetings and other general operations information.\n- Oversight of DOPELABS work responsibilities, submission of billable hours and release of payment for hours worked.\n\n**OPERATIONS CAPO** – SLASHER \n\n**Pay Scale:** $30 p/h\n\n**Responsibilities:** \n\n- Tracking of meeting action items and updates.\n- Minutes for Official DOPE DAO meetings.\n- Accounting of treasury, expenditures and revenue.\n- Community updates on DIP tasks, meetings and other general operations information.\n- Research and Development that relates to Operations.\n\n \n\n**ENGINEER CORE UNIT**\n\n**PRODUCT MANAGER** – FACESOfEth\n\n**Pay Scale:** $70 p/h\n\n**Responsibilities:** \n\n- Tracking of meeting action items and updates.\n- Product vision, technical requirements review, architecture alignment with regard to build projects that take place within the DOPEWARS ecosystem.\n- Brand and product oversight to provide mentorship, advice and provision of design to help keep the vision of DOPEWARS cohesive.\n\nDEV DON - FACESOfEth\n\n**Pay Scale:** $50\n\n- Website / infrastructure maintenance & smart contract code review.\n- Oversight GITHUB, code review.\n\n**DEV CAPO** - BORT\n\n**Pay Scale:** $40 p/h\n\n**Responsibilities:** \n\n- Website/Infrastructure maintenance.\n- Oversight GITHUB, code review.\n- Understudy Lead DEV and assist.\n\n**DIFFUSION CORE UNIT**\n\n**Public Relations DON** – CYBERBITZ\n\n**Pay Scale:** $50 p/h\n\n- Collaborations with other projects.\n- Public Branding.\n- Develop marketing strategy.\n- Regular Twitter releases. Ownership of the DOPEWARS Twitter account until such time as DAO tools are available to enable DAO owned Twitter.\n- Instagram releases (once account established).\n- Community engagements on Social Media and Community Communications Platforms.\n\n**PROPAGANDA OFFICER** – RICHBLCK\n\n**Pay Scale:** $40 p/h\n\n**Responsibilities:** \n\n- Create engaging and informative content.\n- Producing Dope News (Monthly).\n- Create any other additional marketing material needed by the DAO.\n- Develop creative ways to help promote DOPEWARS.\n\n**PROTOCOL CORE UNIT**\n\n**CONSIGLIERE** - Taniela.Taki\n\n**Pay Scale:** $50 p/h\n\n**Responsibilities:** \n\n- Conduit between DOPE DAO and MIDAO Marshall Islands.\n- Ensure DAO Protocols established in the OPERATING AGREEMENT are being adhered to. Monitor alignment with our actions as a DAO and our status as a Not For Profit LLC.\n- Conduit between the DOPE DAO and Legal Counsel and; or legal documents. Work to help triage legal matters in order to discern levels of importance and urgency so as to most efficiently engage Legal Counsel.\n- Proposal review.\n- Research and direction to help keep DOPE DAO legitimate and above board.\n\n**BILLING:**\n\nBilling is a complicated problem in this high trust decentralised environment. I propose we solve it thusly:\n\n- We allocate a maximum of 30 hours per job title, per month, that are available to bill against as required.\n- We will release $Paper from the treasury in 2 month blocks to a 5 person Multi Sig wallet that the Operations Manager, assisted by a Member from each Core Unit, will control and administer.  Two people will be required to co-sign, with at least one of them being a Member of the Operations Cell.\n- MultiSig will include SPRTN, SLASHER, CYBERBITZ, FACES and TANIELA.\n- Hours will be billed on a 1 monthly basis. The requirement to bill and account for hours will be placed upon the Member who is billing for hours.\n- It will be the Operations Manager responsibility to maintain oversight and accountability of work completed within DOPELABS then authorise payment. Then they will file the information in a place available to all DOPE DAO members for transparency.\n- The Operations Core Unit Members will be responsible to account and invoice for their own hours worked and will submit their invoices to the Consigliere within the PROTOCOL Core Unit for verification.\n- $Paper will be paid at a weighted average value as calculated over the month of billable work.\n- If the price of $Paper falls below a threshold of 0.0012 over the period of a month, then the quantity of $Paper payable to DOPELABS Members will be resubmitted to a DAO vote through the Official Proposal Process under the Normal Variations of Business Clause. **VI.3**\n\nIt is time for DOPEWARS to shine like the crazy diamond it is. The creation of DOPELABS will be a step toward generating a DAO Structure with a more resilient network. Our Member Managed DAO will have a means to legitimately and democratically elect Members who are willing and capable to perform the necessary functions of the DAO. Doing so will not hinder the core value of DOPE DAO. Instead, it will be a large leap toward creating the platform to enable this vision. An act to ensure we can propel this project into the future and join the other projects that will make it through this current atmosphere and into the Metaverse.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidgclshyhy5o43h46hw4tbcafm36laoxqdkv2yyq4gqukdyjh4r6a)\n    \nTani",

      "title": "DIP-67 MMO Remediation",
      "content": "# Overview\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to improve the overall MMO experience to have a clean field to add new features. Before adding anything new, we want make sure hustlers can log correctly with their gear, and have a smooth experience in both map and social features. \n\n## 1. Optimize and Smooth the Overall Experience\n\nThe frame rate drops when moving from a district to another because the game instantiate too much elements at once. We want to improve the experience by testing several ideas we have in mind.\n\n### 1A. **Initial Loading Time**\n\n*[local : no problem | about 7s to load]*\n\n*[online : unknown]*\n\n### Notes\n\n- The initial loading doesn’t seem to have a code problem as it is working without errors and relatively fast locally.\n- Compress the textures to the maximum compression without visual quality loss\n- Make sure the format of the textures is adapted to a web browser game\n- Calculate the full weight of the loaded textures and optimize it if possible\n- Ensure the loading only loads the tile the player is on\n- Loading manual unit testing to identify either problems or unoptimized behaviours\n- Make smaller tiles [LDTK]\n- Online test sessions\n\n### 1B. **Tilemap Loading Time**\n\n*[local : not smooth | breaks the dynamism]*\n\n### Tasks\n\n*[online : same behaviour]*\n\n### Notes\n\n- When a game/scene is using several tiles/chunks that are active or not, based on the player’s position, the usual method to avoid the loadings from blocking the player experience and progression is to use multi-threading. This process allows us through a concurrent execution to load or unload other tiles/chunks with different threads while the player and rendering are still active on the main thread.\n- Some games don’t use threads at all and load all the assets of the scene but this solution is not conceivable due to the high number of textures the MMO needs.\n- Javascript is a single thread language but has “close to thread” behaviour mechanisms such as “async/await” keywords. This makes asynchronous code possible but it is not true multi-threading. There are several libraries though that can be used to have a thread-like implementation like “thread.js”.\n\n### Tasks\n\n- Divide the tiles in 9 proportional areas [8 around, 1 at the center] that will be called “sub-tiles” and add each of their center positions to a bidimensionnal array :\n \n\"[tiles] - [sub-tiles] -> sub-tiles center pos  \"\n \" - [tile center pos]\"\n    \n- Implement basic AABB collision detection to detect in which sub-tile the player’s collider is in\n- Implement a thread system with the most adapted method in the tile loading function so the loading happens on another thread\n- Based on the player sub-tile progress, call the loading of the 3 closest tiles [either with 1 or 3 threads -> need to run some tests to choose the less expensive way]\n- Check up and fix data races possible problems\n- Verify the memory management to avoid leaks and minimize fragmentation\n- Testing sessions\n- Fix problems\n- Online testing sessions\n\n### 1C. **General Optimization**\n\n### Notes:\n\n- A few more things could improve the game performances like instancing, which allows us to reduce the number of draw calls, frustum culling which will render only the visible parts on screen, improve the shaders if possible and double check the code in general and simplify it if it is possible.\n- The use of a tool to calculate the number of operations from a part of code would help a lot.\n\n### Estimates & Cost\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicgpqkhb3whysnfcvgfone6kdax3spnsy6qfbfikrenhrluyvwhki)\n    \n### Acceptance\n\n*******************DAO members should verify that…*******************\n\n- On a desktop computer with a decent internet connection, the start/initial loading is improved (compare with the previous loading)\n- On a desktop computer with a decent internet connection, the players can walk around the map without noticing the tiles loading\n\n## 2. Hustlers Gear and Inventory Fix Proposal\n\nSome people cannot log with their full gear or cannot choose their hustlers when they have several. We want to dig the way sprite sheet are linked to the server to fix it. \n\nBecause this work is unknown at the moment, we should investigate what needs to be done and create a separate proposal for it.\n\n### Estimates\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreib42gnzau2dgje4a6ydo4l7aps7e3fkka5hni2e6tgix6qocurrsi)\n    \n### Acceptance\n\n**********************************DAO members should verify they can**********************************\n\n- Understand the work to be completed to fix Hustlers and Gear showing up in their game inventory\n- Understand the costs associated with making these fixes so they can vote with all the information necessary\n\n## 3. MMO Controls [UI - UX]\n\nPlayer controls and introduction are hidden when the game loads. Work needs to be done in order to make those controls discoverable, and match the polish of the rest of the [dopewars.gg](http://dopewars.gg) website. Once learned, player controls seem quite straight forward but a pop up for new players with a recap of the controls and a small UI widget displaying when pressing a key could make it much clearer.\n\n### Estimates\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicxsgzui5y4ko3e3sr2uqszjcux5cqcgcrqqbe33tl6lgbkzjcfm4)\n    \n### Acceptance\n\n**DAO members should verify that…**\n\n- The players can join the game and learn the controls the first time on a desktop computer\n\n## 4. Visual Problems\n\nThe map still has several visuals issues, like sorting layers not working correctly when between 2 objects. To make sure it won’t happen anymore, we want to replace props with game objects, allowing us to use a better collision system. \n\n### 4A. Tilemap Layers Fixes\n\n*[local : visual problem]*\n\n*[online : visual problem]*\n\n### Notes:\n\n- HP has an idea of what’s going on with the layers messing around. From what I understood, there are 2 problems:\n    - Some “props” are embedded in the same objects which makes it impossible in certain cases to have a prop “in front” and one “behind”.\n    - The level design tool used for the map need a lot of layers to put everything together. We need to merge the layers that belong to the same depth level, to drastically reduce the amount of loaded tiles\n\n### 4B. **Normal Map Fixes**\n\n*[local : visual problem]*\n\n*[online : visual problem]*\n\n### Estimates\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreia2dc3r6x3iwfm7s55c2p2pqz4kr2bqoxre7vau367hvp7kq6avtq)\n    \n### Acceptance\n\n**************************Dao members should verify they can…**************************\n\n- Walk around the game without noticing the previously specified layer problem\n- Street lights normal should not be seen\n\n## 5. Stress Test Post Fixes - 50 to 200 people\n\nWe did a first stress test back the end of 2021 to test the performance of the game. With the new fixes we are bringing, we will do other stress tests to check the critical mass for the server and the performances\n\n### **TESTS AND INVESTIGATION**\n\n*[local : a few players simulated seems to work without problems]*\n\n*[online : need to test]*\n\n### Estimates\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreignb4drweacjeot3eykgif34foulqthqm5zugaayl4hkxmtxygghm)\n    \n ### Acceptance\n\n**********************************DAO members should verify they can**********************************\n\n- Have a smooth experience with 50 people on the server\n- Know the limit of the number of players possible at the same time\n- Know what are the steps to achieve to have X people at the same time\n\n## 6. Chat Features Testing and Polishing\n\nThe ability for the chat to follow in large scale isn’t proved and we’ll need to test the chat in a larger scale. \n\n### **TESTS AND INVESTIGATION**\n\n*[local : the chat works well with a few players simulated]*\n\n*[online : need to test]*\n\n### Estimates\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreici5bvqemquf77i2nfaaeivaelv6nqri2uv2o3tloppesi5jsoenu)\n    \n### Acceptance\n\n**********************************DAO members should verify they can**********************************\n\n- Chat with other players without problems\n\n## 7. System Requirements\n\nCreate a system requirements document so that players understand the minimum level computer needed to play the DOPE MMO [need the cooperation of many testers] .\n\n### Estimates\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicj2xnvyyxyvj4t2vdhmuia3dvwu7xsxwsijcg5lwynvze73gyo2y)\n    \n### Acceptance\n\n**********************************DAO members should verify they can**********************************\n\n- Understand what machine the player needs to have to play the game\n\n## 8.

Unit Test the Game Backend (bort)\n\nTo minimize the risk of features breaking after code changes and the time spent on manual testing, most of the critical code in the backend should be unit-tested. Before we can write any tests we need to refactor the backend in such a way, that individual functionality can be tested, which can be achieved by reducing the tight coupling. We do not want all unit tests breaking, just because of a small change which is not even related to them…\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreie6tsqmyyjz4tcp6xmbkljjniz4vqa76a3t3gmgwlueob3hhek2su)\n    \n### Acceptance\n\n**********************************DAO members should verify********************************** \n\n- We have ~85% Code Coverage on the game backend\n\n# Team\n\nThomas (@johntelman7x7) - Game Developer\n\nHPMNK (@HPMNK) - Game Artist - Game QA\n\nFaces (@facesofeth) - Visual designer / frontend dev\n\nBort (@bort) - Backend Developer / DevOps Engineer\n\n# Budget\n\nThe estimated time for the whole work can go up to a couple months.\n\nTotal Budget : $24,980 to be paid in OP",

      "title": "DIP-63 Arrakis Liquidity",
      "content": "GM DOPE DAO\n\nI salute you all for your patience on this matter. It’s time to execute the transfer of $Paper, ETH and OP to the Arrakis Vaults.\n\nOur friend Mazzi has calculated a weighted average over the last 7 days for the Start Price of $Paper at: 0.00186877660652936 🙂. Mazzi has an eye for detail team.\n\nLike I mentioned in the previous Snapshot, the price of $Paper can be easily manipulated with relatively small buying or selling. Leaving the decision, regarding the true value of $Paper, up to an arbitrary pluck of the price indication on the day of establishing the Tally vote would be leaving it to chance and not a true representation. This weighted average represents an honest value for our utility token $Paper.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/3919dcdc-6150-4b56-9017-db9ed6e8fa57_400x400.jpg)\n\nThe next matter is logistics. How we practically achieve the task of getting the tokens to the correct places. This will happen as follows.\n\nThis Tally proposal will transfer 112,500,000 $Paper tokens (75M L1 & 37.5M L2) and 4.765 ETH (Current value $1548 - 5% of 75M $Paper for L1) to the Multisig 0x0c004b7cF408f2c418200bA83826F7451e22fa24 controlled by myself, Cyberbitz and Slasher. \n\nThe Multisig will then transfer 37.5M $Paper to my control and I will bridge it to L2 and transfer to the DOPE DAO L2 wallet. I have been nominated for this task because I am KYC’d with the MIDAO Marshall Islands, the home of the Legal Registered Office of DOPE DAO.\n\nLet it be put on the record that I will be nervous while conducting the bridge. But I will breath through it and share a screen with Slasher who can be an extra set of eyes to ensure it is done correctly.\n\nThis Tally will also authorise the manual release of $3,688.37 USD worth of OP from our L2 wallet to be used as the L2 pair in the Arrakis Vault. (5% of 37.5M %Paper for L2). Once the tokens have been put in their correct places Slasher will work with the Arrakis Team to approve the PALM term contract and interact with the contracts to set up the vaults.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/81fc3999-f6ec-4623-ba91-4692c8b9cf53_400x400.jpg)\n\nThe final matter is the creation of the Constitutional Contract Element of this vote as per the DOPE DAO LLC Operating Agreement. Our Lawyer has given us the green light to move forward with Arrakis Liquidity but only on the basis that the provision of Liquidity is for the sole purpose of generating health liquidity for $Paper so as to make it a viable Utility Token. What we are intending to achieve is to make $Paper capable of working successfully, which it cannot currently do due to the almost zero amount of liquidity. This intent is opposed to an outcome that would see us utilising a Liquidity Pool to exchange $Paper for ETH that would then be returned to the DAO. This would constitute, and depict, an intent to sell $Paper. The sale of $Paper, by the DAO, has been advised against by the Lawyer at this time.\n\nTherefore this vote is drafted as a Constitutional Contract vote for DOPE DAO. It will be subject to the below conditions and will only be executed if it passes by a 75% majority.\n\nIf this vote passes by a 75% majority then the DAO will be bound to the below outcome for 12 months as described in the DOPE DAO Operating Agreement.  The Arrakis Vault Contract lasts for 12 months. At which time we can reassess the legal and technological landscape and redeploy and re vote as appropriate.\n\n**CONSITUTIONAL CONTRACT**\n\nWe, DOPE DAO, agree that the deployment of the tokens in this proposal will be used solely for the purpose of providing Liquidity for our Native Utility Token $Paper. The DAO will not create any proposal that seeks to alter the deployment of these tokens unless the below conditions are met.\n\n1. Legal Counsel advises DOPE DAO that it is feasible to do so.\n2. There is a technological reason that makes it reasonable for the DAO to move the Liquidity Position to a different platform.\n\n\nThis vote will be a simple YES/NO\n\nOnce again we find ourselves on the frontline of DAOism.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/b2b62028-88f2-422e-b0e1-55598446db08_400x400.jpg)\n\nTani.",

      "content": "Dear DOPE DAO.\n\nWe made great progress after getting some solid legal advice from Thomas Plunkett. It allowed us to charge forward on a number of fronts. This kind of legal exploration is a necessary part of DEVELOPMENT for DOPE DAO. I suggest that now will be a wise time to utilise some of those development funds to secure the good lawyer on a retainer. The retainer will secure hours of work at an agreed rate. We will 100% need legal counsel in the future. Let’s plan ahead while we have capital.\n\nI propose that we place Thomas Plunkett on a 20k USD retainer payable in OP.\n\nPayment would be executed and then held by the lawyer as is practice under a retainer agreement that I can organise. I propose that legal issues can be raised and vetted by the PROTOCOL Core Unit Member acting as the Legal Engineer. (The PROTOCOL Core Unit position will be part of a current proposal “DOPELABS’ that is underway). In effect, until we have it established I can utilise my experience of DOPEWARS positions and Web3 Legal terrain so that issues can then be triaged and advice requested in the most efficient and cost effective manner. \n\n20k USD is the same amount that was spent to get the previous legal advice that allowed for the Registration Opinion, Treasury Management (including the recent Arrakis Liquidity development) Opinion, Gaming Legal Opinion and the Contractor Agreement that the DAO now possesses. I believe this would be a excellent use of our development funds to ensure that we can continue to develop the DopeWars ecosystem.\n\nI can already foresee us needing counsel on upcoming issues like; creation and minting of future digital assets, intellectual property ownership issues that relate to provenance, potential trademark issues, the future of liquidity as well as all the unforeseen questions that will arise.\n \n![legalGigaShiz.png](ipfs://bafkreiglnaeztdgr7btqc4ae32ajjdraxxa7w5ycgw2rwwnvlkvgmad3yy)\n       \n\nThe frontline is everywhere, and in the case of the legal frontier, we are right up on that line. \n\nFor your consideration.\n\nTani",

      "content": "GM Hustlers.\nThank you for your patience. There are a lot of factors that we have had to work through to get us to a point where we can move the vote forward. But here we are looking to nail down exactly how much $Paper we will deploy to an Arrakis Palm Protocol to help DOPE DAO alleviate the liquidity challenges we face. \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibaetsbx7qlilzuxhaz76go4giu3el6mmwx4to7z4q2kk2wlgm3rq)\n\nFirstly we need to cover off some of the parameters that we are voting on. Because it is so cumbersome to have individual votes on each setting, we have narrowed down the options via discussion on Discord and taking advice from Arrakis on best recommendations. Again the option to ABSTAIN is present if you believe the vote does not represent your position or if you believe certain issues need to be discussed further. \n\nThe settings that will be assumed for this vote are as follows:\n1.\tThe deployment ratio will be 95% Native Asset ($Paper), 5% Base Asset (ETH/OP).\n2.\tThe settings will be Option 1 as described by Arrakis in their parameter recommendations document (see below). Negligible difference to Option 2 but slightly more support to trading.\n3.\tThe initial price setting for $Paper will be a figure that is close to the value of $Paper at time of deployment, i.e. when we vote on a Tally Proposal to actually release funds.  This issue is somewhat complicated; the lack of liquidity has made the task of determining the actual value of $Paper difficult. The price range over the last while has bounced from a lower range of 0.001 to an upper range around 0.002. However these values are rather misleading anyway, as any large sale of Paper will only yield a low return and any attempt to buy a significant portion will cost the buyer a lot more than the described value. This is why we are trying to fix the liquidity issue right..!! The reality is that the price can be easily manipulated with relatively small buying or selling. But for the purposes of this proposal it will be helpful for us to look at what the eventual start price will mean in terms of a 5% deployment of the base asset, either ETH or possibly OP as a pair in the PALM vault. So for the purposes of this Snapshot I will outline below what those commitments look like at an average start price of 0.0015. \n\n$Paper 37.5 Million:      $56,250.00\t = \tETH/OP - $2697.37\n$Paper 50 Million:\t     $75,000.00\t =\tETH/OP - $3947.37\n$Paper 75 Million:\t     $112,000.00\t =\tETH/OP - $6447.37\t\n\nThe current amount of ETH in the treasury is 54.16 ETH. Current value - $88,945.00. All values USD.\n\nThe current amount of OP in the treasury is much, much more.. We are awaiting confirmation from Slasher on the position of OPTIMISM with regard to using some of the OP Grant as a potential pair on L2. \n\nWith all these figures in mind, you can do the math on what each deployment option will be in terms of commitment of both Native and Base assets.\n\nIf you would like to take a look at the discussions and recommendations please follow the link to the Discord Arrakis Liquidity thread here:\n\nhttps://discordapp.com/channels/882333869007839252/1064519573728141395\n\nYou will find all the information here about how Arrakis Palm Protocol is designed to bootstrap liquidity and trend the pairing toward a 50/50 split. The abovementioned document from Arrakis looks like this:\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreib6umgwnffdgsrkotvem75sebpizfrrg53zbd6ybaag27spl4jdha)\n\nSo without further ado.\nHow much $Paper should the DAO deploy to Arrakis Liquidity on both L1 & L2? \n\n    \n\n\n    \n",

      "content": "\n![image](ipfs://bafkreih62xm64urdp6uajdd6h2lcevfsui2bbge2cvzdp4lzvqtzj4cgva)\n \n# Project Overview\n## Background\n\nFunding the MMO and associated assets is by far our largest expense as a DAO and have commissioned great work such as our sprite sheets, MMO maps, and [a prototype of a working game that we stress tested a few months ago](https://www.notion.so/Stress-Test-Log-283e3a7888514ca1ac507fc48ca39cb4). \n\nCurrently the MMO game server is not live because it needs a final push of work to leave running in a state where players can access it at any time without problems or lag.\n\n*The developer single-handedly in charge of this effort has moved onto other projects, and is not available for future work.*\n\n#### FACES and HPMNK are asking the DOPE DAO permission to fund a time-boxed investigation and remediation project to do the following…\n\n1. Onboard developers who can work on the MMO back-end and front-end engine in the future\n2. Swap out the non-standard authentication code for Sign in with Ethereum and Firebase authentication, which much more standard and portable across the MMO and Dopewars.gg\n3. Investigate and report on issues to ensure players can join the game as their Hustler with all of their gear in their wallet without bugs and run around a quickly loading map\n\n## Responsible parties, Time & Rate\n\n- Rate is quoted at $70/hr (100% OP) for `bort#1339`\n- Rate is quoted at $60/hr (100% OP) for `johntelman7x7#6819`\n- Estimates below bring cost to ~ **$7760**\n\n## ROI\n\n- The DAO has invested in the MMO as the focal point to launch other experiences, such as the Starknet Game, RPS, Dope Frenzy, and other mini-games to be launched in the future.\n- DAO members have spent time working on a quest module for the MMO, and planned revenue-generating items such as Turf and the Apartment Builder rely on the MMO functioning before becoming viable.\n- DOPE DAO needs the MMO up and running before any of these other items are interesting to the community. It’s critical to the success of our DAO that the MMO is a high quality, always functioning service.\n\n## 1. Onboard new developers\n\n### Background\n\nThe developer responsible for all of the coding work on Dope MMO has moved onto other opportunities and is no longer available to work on Dope Wars. We must bring new developers up to speed that are able to continually work on the MMO, just to get it up and running.\n\nHPMNK has been working with two such developers on FrensLand that would like to build future experiences for Dope Wars – including the Apartment Builder. Other developers from the community have also expressed interest in working on the MMO, but have no experience doing so.\n\n### Scope\n\n- Ensure the MMO Game Server is documented well enough for new devs to get running on their machines\n- Work with new developers to answer questions about current game code structure\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Documentation and a script that can run the Go game server + React+Phaser front-end client on their local machine\n\n### Estimates\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreif2mie6ymow6noofqr7ls5pubtvfg3fimzwdlo6tiu5cu2spzsaha)\n    \n### Responsible Party & Current Work\n\n`bort#1339` will be doing most of this work and will be the one compensated. He has completed much of it already with the Github PR request that was merged into the codebase as shown below\n\n`https://github.com/dopedao/dope-monorepo/pull/336`\n\n### Acceptance\n\n*DAO members should verify that…*\n\n- A competent engineer with a few years of full-stack experience can get the game server and front-end client running on their machine after downloading the source with Github\n\n## 2. Standardize authentication with Firebase\n\n### Background\n\nThe current game uses a non-standard authentication mechanism that requires a production server to be up and live at all times, even for development. This is brittle, and prevents developers from getting the MMO up and running on their local machines.\n\nAdditionally, performing authentication in memory does not allow us to scale the game service beyond one server, since authentication information is stored in memory. \n\nOn other projects, FACES has used a combination of SIWE (sign in with Ethereum) and Firebase to provide authentication across services. This is a more standard way of authenticating that is portable across games, chat, and other experiences.\n\n### Scope\n\n- Remove custom auth code\n- Enable SIWE\n- Tie SIWE + Firebase auth together\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- A game server that uses Firebase authentication, in dev and in production\n\n### Estimates\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicvljgwhdmdrn6rikooabvhkcczy7k62wniah4oarb5hjpkx5sram)\n\n### Responsible Party & Current Work\n\nHPMNK’s developer `johntelman7x7#6819` has started to work with the code, and is [tracking the work in this thread in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/882333869007839252/1060953789877723136). A Pull Request (PR) on github is to be submitted.\n\n![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4703efc3-3dd6-4d6d-9053-9a6f3b660516/Untitled.png)\n\n### Acceptance\n\n*DAO members should verify that…*\n\n- They can sign into the game server available at [dopewars.gg/game](http://dopewars.gg/game) with their Ethereum wallet smoothly\n- Developers can stand up the game server on their local machines and authenticate, viewing the tokens being created by Firebase in the browser Developer Tools\n\n## 3. Investigate and report issues identified on the MMO\n\n### Background\n\nCurrently, logging into the game and loading the map are a poor experience. Hustlers do not load properly all of the time. Gear seems to be missing, and the experience isn’t smooth. \n\nLoading of the map as you walk around DOPE CITY is slow, and somewhat jerky. This is not a great experience and should be optimized. We need to smooth this out to be a simple process to ensure Hustlers enjoy the experience of loading the MMO.\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- A written proposal with time + cost to ensure Hustlers can…\n    - Experience a smooth, bug-free sign in experience to the game.\n    - Intuitively understand how to operate the controls of the social MMO game\n    - Load their DOPE WARS inventory in game with up-to-date information from the API\n    - Change Hustlers without performance problems\n    - Wander around the map with up to 50 hustlers with no performance problems loading the map\n    - Chat with each other flawlessly\n\n### Estimates \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreib622hxp4f5sgdi42m2wp5f7zefplem3crkbixbfu2a2cj2qgm7o4)\n    \n### Scope\n\nInvestigation needs to be performed on the game server to understand what fixes we might need to budget for going forward. \n\nWith this in mind, a proposal to complete the work for stabilization should be created from the time-boxed investigation above by `johntelman7x7#6819`, with enough detail that another competent developer could pick up the work and complete it with specific time + cost estimates as outlined in the proposal\n\n### Acceptance\n\n*DAO members should verify that…*\n\n- A well written proposal with detailed time + cost estimates is produced that addresses the problems listed above in DELIVERABLES\n- A set of minimum work is identified that can solve the problems explained above\n\n### Responsible Party & Current Work\n\nHPMNK’s developer `johntelman7x7#6819` has started to work with the code, and discovered the following items. \n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifl7npqxzlfer77wlerj2qx3gwwab42ul3k7ah3a3dszeoc6uypnm)\n    \n\n`facesof.eth#0777` will work with him to create a proposal that addresses the most pressing concerns, such as \n\n- Fixing slow loading of map tiles\n- Ensuring Hustler inventory loads properly and can be switched easily by new players\n\n# Cost + Consultant Agreement\n\nThe work outlined above will be completed by ********************RESPONSIBLE PARTIES******************** contracted through the DAO. All work will be open sourced and available publicly through Github at [https://github.com/dopedao](https://github.com/dopedao). All rights, trademarks, and IP created as a result of this work will be property of the DOPE DAO.\n\nIP & Contractor agreements should be signed by all parties as required by DAO operating agreement.\nhttps://www.notion.so/dope-wars/DIP-62-Initial-MMO-Remediation-work-a1706eb6a043410fa55510dac890a7a8#cb34ea4fbbd848c3ace26d2c8eeca533\n\nhttps://www.notion.so/dope-wars/DIP-62-Initial-MMO-Remediation-work-a1706eb6a043410fa55510dac890a7a8#d5492fc150994d37930c9b83afc28d3f\n\n### Payment\n\nAssuming THE DAO approves this proposal, the equivalent OP amount will be paid to contractors listed above.\n\nIt’s expected that payment of OP should be rendered upon Acceptance of each objective outlined above. This should result in 3 payments (or partial paymet as required) upon completion of items listed above.",

(Protocol Automated Liquidity Management)\nhttps://resources.arrakis.fi/palm/introduction\n\nAnd the DOPEDAO discord discussion here: https://discord.com/channels/882333869007839252/1064519573728141395 \n\nTime for a shout out to Mr Pink for some heavy lifting in this space! \n \n![Mr Pink Wen.png.jpg](ipfs://bafybeia675pn6yu6sd4ezvhsmo4vcrdc4xhshiftcidxjzvpp3houm5k6m)\n    \n\nThere are many variations of how exactly an Arrakis setup would look. This presents difficulty when trying to obtain accurate community consensus via our DOPE DAO voting mechanisms. We are also waiting for some feedback from Arrakis that pertains to some specific recommendations. In the meantime I believe we can work toward stripping away some options that are at a fundamental level. That way we can begin to narrow our focus as we wait, as well as ensure that we are getting voting data that speaks to the true intention of the DAO. \n\nFor the purpose of this vote, all Yes votes (Options 2, 3 & 4) shall be viewed as YES votes for working with Arrakis providing Liquidity wherever the DAO deems fit. We can imagine a scenario where 60% of the vote is spread across YES options 2, 3 & 4 with option 1 (NAH) having a 40% majority. As well as an instance of a voter for whom the only suitable choice would be liquidity on a particular layer. This is why option 5, to ABSTAIN, is present. \n\n \n![Arrakis.png](ipfs://bafkreieinovj6x3gi6z5n2bwhq5uvmjosrhofrkrddjkhequykhjm3looy)\n    \n    \n\nWithout further ado. \n\nShould Dope DAO utilise Arrakis to create liquidity? \n",

The Swap Meet will generate income in the form of royalties on items transacted, and a home for Dope Wars experiences.\n\n## Components & Responsibilities\n\n![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/1d298029-b92f-4cee-932c-a28d20f9b3ca/Untitled.png)\n\n- Our [blockchain indexer](https://github.com/dopedao/dope-monorepo/tree/main/packages/api/indexer) written in Go collects information from the Ethereum and Optimism chains. It listens to events from our smart contracts, and writes information about NFT ownership and configuration to a SQL database.\n- Our [Job Server](https://github.com/dopedao/dope-monorepo/blob/main/packages/api/cmd/jobServer/main.go), also written in Go collects sales and price information about DOPE NFTs from OpenSea, then stores that information in the same database.\n- Information from that database is served through a [GraphQL API written in Go](https://github.com/dopedao/dope-monorepo/tree/main/packages/api/web).\n- A [front-end Next.js app written in Typescript](https://github.com/dopedao/dope-monorepo/tree/main/packages/web) reads that information, then presents it to visitors on dopewars.gg.\n\n## 1. Bulletproof the Optimism Indexer\n\n### Background\n\nDOPE DAO members have been complaining for months that some information about HUSTLERS, GEAR, and DOPE NFTs are not up to date in their inventory.\n\n![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/d2584d87-af7a-4466-b06c-cf957436858b/Untitled.png)\n\n![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/437ccaaf-400c-4452-a5ba-65d29cabe752/Untitled.png)\n\n![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/36a871b5-0f30-45d5-9c3e-7fc954894a3a/Untitled.png)\n\nLooking through the server logs, it appears as if there are SQL errors that need to be investigated and resolved combined with some API issues from Alchemy.\n\nSpecifically, some Hustlers contain a `tokenURI` that we believe is too large to receive through Optimistic Etherscan and the Alchemy API. To verify, try to read the tokenURI for `hustlerId 2400` [using this link](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xdbfeaae58b6da8901a8a40ba0712beb2ee18368e#readContract#F16) and see the error for yourself. \n\nAdditionally, we should re-evaluate if another approach to collecting this information might be less costly and more performant. The current server running the indexer costs us the DAO roughly $300/month on Google Cloud Platform.\n\n### Scope\n\n- Ensure the indexer runs with no critical errors written to the logs\n- Verify that everyone who has complained about missing items has them in their inventory\n- Verify that all DOPE NFTs have up-to-date PAPER status\n- Verify that all DOPE NFTs have up-to-date GEAR claim status\n- Verify all Hustlers have Names and Photos\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- A bug-free indexer that runs without error\n- A job that can be run to synchronize to the current state of ETH mainnet and Optimism\n\n### Estimates (~40 hrs)\n\n| Chore | Time | Cost | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Investigation + Fixes | 24 hrs | $4800 | To ensure the indexer can run error-free. |\n| Sync Job Script | 6 hrs | $1200 | Create a grift (go) script for synchronizing events the indexer might miss. |\n| Ensure search index is always updated | 4 hrs | $800 | Not sure the materialized view is continually refreshing, meaning search results can be out of date. |\n| Ensure Hustlers can equip / un-equip inventory on Dopewars.gg | 6 hrs | $1200 | After fixes to the indexer, some Hustlers are unable to equip items. |\n| TOTALS | 40 hrs | $8000 |  |\n\n### Acceptance\n\n*DAO members should verify that…*\n\n- Their items appear in inventory within 15 minutes of a transfer or update to the blockchain\n- All PAPER and GEAR claims for DOPE NFTs appear correct on [dopewars.gg](http://dopewars.gg) within 15 minutes of contract interaction\n\n### Current Work\n\nThe bulk of this work has already been completed, with the exception of the last item *(Ensure Hustlers can equip…)* over the month of December / January in Faces’ spare time. Work can be verified on [dopewars.gg](http://dopewars.gg) and on Github with the following PRs\n\n[https://github.com/dopedao/dope-monorepo/pull/333](https://github.com/dopedao/dope-monorepo/pull/333)\n\n[https://github.com/dopedao/dope-monorepo/pull/332](https://github.com/dopedao/dope-monorepo/pull/332)\n\n[https://github.com/dopedao/dope-monorepo/pull/331](https://github.com/dopedao/dope-monorepo/pull/331)\n\n## 2. Streamline purchases with Reservoir NFT API\n\n![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/8978c7c6-313b-475f-8bb0-0f8f7d445166/Untitled.png)\n\n### Background\n\nCurrently the Swap Meet indexes listings from OpenSea for DOPE NFTs. These are stored in our SQL database, then we link to OpenSea to make purchases for items that has been listed for sale. Listings from Quixotic for HUSTLERS and GEAR are not indexed at all.\n\nIt’s long been the DAO’s desire that we should be able to buy and sell all DOPE items directly on the Swap Meet at [Dopewars.gg](http://Dopewars.gg) using either ETH or PAPER.\n\nThe fine folks at Reservoir have a wonderful solution that pools liquidity and listings from multiple sources, and presents them through a reliable API that we can consume.\n\n[Reservoir: Democratizing NFT Liquidity](https://reservoir.tools/)\n\nReservoir has also produced a very high quality drop-in React UI library for making purchases directly from multiple sources.\n\n[ReservoirKit UI](https://docs.reservoir.tools/docs/reservoirkit-ui)\n\nUsing both of these tools, we now have the capability to improve the Swap Meet to finally allow for transacting DOPE, HUSTLERS, and GEAR right on [dopewars.gg/swap-meet](https://dopewars.gg/swap-meet)\n\n### Scope\n\n- Import listings from the Reservoir API every few minutes\n    - DOPE NFT on Mainnet\n    - HUSTLERS on Optimism\n    - GEAR on Optimism\n- Implement ReservoirKit UI to allow purchasing items on dopewars.gg\n- Implement ReservoirKit UI to allow listing items on dopewars.gg\n- Eliminate our home-rolled OpenSea indexer\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- [dopewars.gg/swap-meet](http://dopewars.gg/swap-meet) will allow purchasing and listing of DOPE, HUSTLERS, and GEAR for sale in ETH or PAPER\n- Listings will be imported at least every 15 minutes from the Reservoir API which pools liquidity from OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2, etc\n\n### Estimates\n\n| Chore | Time | Cost | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Migrating our database structure to store Listings from Reservoir | 14 hrs | $2800 |  |\n| Update the SQL search stored view to incorporate new listings | 16 hrs | $3200 |  |\n| Creating a Reservoir listing import Script + automating calls to it | 16 hrs | $3200 |  |\n| Implementing front-end to purchase + list items in ETH or PAPER | 40 hrs | $8000 |  |\n| Deploying to production + testing | 4 hrs | $800 |  |\n| TOTALS | 90 hrs | $18,000 |  |\n\n### Acceptance\n\n*DOPE DAO members should be able to…*\n\n- Shop for HUSTLERS without seeing the naked ones\n- Search for DOPE, HUSTLERS, and GEAR that are *For Sale*\n    - Sort items by highest or lowest price\n- Purchase DOPE, HUSTLERS, and GEAR using ETH or PAPER directly from dopewars.gg\n    - Purchased items should reflect their new ownership status within 1 minute on the site\n- List DOPE, HUSTLERS, and GEAR using ETH or PAPER directly from dopewars.gg\n    - Listed items should reflect their status within 1 minute on the site\n- List an item on OpenSea, LooksRare, or X2Y2 and have that listing appear on the site within 15 minutes\n\n## 3. Fix and re-enable Hustler Quick Buy\n\n![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b11e78e8-75d2-4103-9e3e-82ff88d45d78/Untitled.png)\n\n### Background\n\nThe Hustler Quick Buy screen was implemented in March of 2022 as a smart contract that worked with the then-current OpenSea listing contract. When OpenSea upgraded their contract this function broke and we were unable to keep promoting the quick way to “Mint” Hustlers by purchasing a for-sale DOPE NFT with unclaimed Gear.\n\nOnce items 1 and 2 are complete from this proposal, we should be able to modernize Hustler Quick Buy to work with DOPE listings from the Reservoir API and the Reservoir UI Kit.\n\n### Scope\n\n- Pull information from the Reservoir API for DOPE with unclaimed gear\n- Present those items in the current Hustler Quick Buy screen\n- Enable purchases through Reservoir\n- Claim Gear + mint a Hustler within the same window\n\n### Deliverables\n\n- Anyone using an Ethereum wallet on a web browser or Metamask mobile should be able to purchase a new Hustler from [dopewars.gg](http://dopewars.gg) provided there are DOPE NFT items for sale\n- Anyone should be able to “mint” a “Naked Hustler” and then be directed to purchase gear for that Hustler on the Dope Wars Swap Meet\n\n### Estimates (~36 hrs)\n\n| Chore | Time | Cost | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pull Unclaimed DOPE items for sale and hook it into Quick Buy | 8 hrs | $1600 |  |\n| Use Reservoir Kit UI to purchase DOPE in the Quick Buy process | 8 hrs | $1600 |  |\n| Mint a “naked hustler” | 4 hrs | $800 |  |\n| TOTALS | 20 hrs | $4000 |  |\n\n### Acceptance\n\n- Ethereum network users can purchase a DOPE with unclaimed GEAR from [dopewars.gg/hustlers/quick-buy](http://dopewars.gg/hustlers/quick-by)\n- Using the same process, DOPE can be Claimed and Hustler Minted\n- From the same process, a *Naked Hustler* can be minted, then user is redirected to the Swap Meet to purchase and equip gear\n\n# Cost + Consultant Agreement\n\nThe work outlined above will be completed by ********************RESPONSIBLE PARTIES******************** contracted through the DAO.

      "title": "What dev proposals should DOPE DAO prioritize in 2023?",
      "content": "# What development proposals should DOPE DAO prioritize in 2023?\n\n> **NOTE: This poll is not binding, and not about committing specific funds to any one initiative.** \n> \n> *We would like to gauge interest in potential developments from our community going into 2023. It contains estimates of possible spend for illustration purposes only. Final numbers are subject to additional votes and debate before proceeding.*\n\n![](https://dopewars-static.storage.googleapis.com/imgs/dope-dao-assets.png)\n\nTo provide value to the DOPE DAO and its members, some of us have come up with proposals they’d like to see funded to move the mission of DOPE WARS forward. To ensure the DAO is moving forward in a way that benefits all members, we’d like to gauge how we should prioritize this work in 2023 to ensure we’re working on the things that will bring new interest and liquidity into the DOPE ecosystem.\n\nAs a DAO, we will have to be selective in what we choose to fund, when they happen, and the payment structure we choose as compensation.\n\nAt the time of this writing the DOPE DAO has 57.46 ETH, 505M PAPER, and 150K OP tokens spread across treasuries on [Mainnet](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/eip155:1:0xDBd38F7e739709fe5bFaE6cc8eF67C3820830E0C/treasury) and [Optimism](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/oeth:0x90103beDCfbE1eeE44ded89cEd88bA8503580b3D/balances) *available for spending on development* to improve the DOPE ecosystem.\n\n*Developers will most likely want to be compensated in only ETH and OP*, as those are the most liquid tokens available for turning into USD and paying their bills. Given this reality, we only have about **$219.86K** to spend for development purposes before the DAO must raise more money in the form of another NFT mint, or recurring revenue from NFT sales and other avenues.\n\n## OP Grant Initiative\n\nOur community stepped up to the plate and [secured a 300K OP grant](https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-proposal-cycle-7-dope-wars/3592) to incentivize game play and fund development of future DOPE WARS experiences. In the proposal, our DAO agreed to spend the funds in the following ways.\n\n![](https://dopewars-static.storage.googleapis.com/imgs/op-grant-initiative.png)\n\n## Current Spend\n\nThe only thing the DAO has committed to fund ongoing is hosting of [Dopewars.gg](http://Dopewars.gg) and the associated costs of Google Cloud Platform. In Q4 2022, those costs were nearly 4 ETH. \n\nTo ensure the ongoing hosting of Dopewars.gg we must allocate roughly 16 ETH for the rest of 2023 to ensure the site stays live.\n\n# Future Development Initiatives\n\nThe table below outlines initiatives that have been floated by the community as ideas we could move forward with to improve the DOPE DAO ecosystem. Because we have limited funds and limited dev resources it’s unclear at the moment if we can fund all of them to completion.\n\n![](https://dopewars-static.storage.googleapis.com/imgs/proposed-spend.png)\n\n**Taking into account that we only have $219.86K in ETH and OP to spend, we must be selective about what we finance and in what sequence we do it.**\n\n# Initiative Breakdown\n\nBelow you’ll find a quick summary of each initiative and links to proposals that exist with more information. Please use this information to VOTE on what you feel we should prioritize, and in what order. These initiatives are not comprehensive, but are the ones that we have the most information about.\n\n### Continue hosting DopeWars.gg\n\n**Summary**\n\n- Pay for hosting and maintenance costs to keep the site at [DopeWars.gg](http://dopewars.gg) up and running that hosts the About page, Hustler Initiator, Swap Meet, and MMO.\n\n**Impact**\n\n- [DopeWars.gg](http://Dopewars.gg) is the hub for all things Dope Wars. If it goes away we’re not sure where else people would interact with our assets.\n\n**Revenue**\n\n- None\n\n### Stabilize and Launch MMO Beta\n\n👉 [Detailed proposal available here](https://www.notion.so/7ddc35d4d0a84101bdbe7692049da509)\n\n**Summary**\n\n- To date, we’ve spent 50+ ETH on the development of an immersive virtual world that is intended to be the launchpad for all other DOPE WARS experiences and games.\n- The code we have needs some refinement before the experience is able to be hosted continually without issues.\n\n**Impact**\n\n- We believe the immersive MMO will become the social hub for Hustlers, and will demonstrate to community members and outsiders the value of having a Hustler.\n- Being able to experience this world will drive demand for other experiences based on DOPE WARS art and music, and lays the foundation for future mints.\n\n**Revenue**\n\n- None\n\n### Launch Swap Meet v2\n\n👉 [Detailed proposal available here](https://www.notion.so/ef64be673a224fac9e7155a044d043af)\n\n**Summary**\n\n- Swap Meet v2 will upgrade [Dopewars.gg](http://Dopewars.gg) to allow for transactions in ETH, PAPER, and OP right from the website to purchase DOPE WARS NFT assets.\n\n**Impact**\n\n- DAO will capture revenue in the form of royalties on all NFT items sold, directly into our treasury without having to wait for payouts on OpenSea.\n- Players have less chance to be rugged by purchasing assets that are already **Claimed** on other marketplaces that don’t have enough information about DOPE ASSETS\n\n**Revenue**\n\n- % of all sales through Swap Meet\n\n### Fund Turf Apartment Builder\n\n👉 [Detailed proposal available here](https://www.notion.so/6ed4d5f54a9c472f8b37530e269bd4e9)\n\n**Summary**\n\n- DOPE WARS Apartment Builder is a housing game-tool built on Optimism that would enable apartments to be built in the DOPE WARS Metaverse.\n- Apartments would be filled with default furnitures and there would be the option to acquire new furnitures in various ways (see Description) to customize the apartment in the Web3 space.\n\n**Impact**\n\n- Hustlers can build areas of the MMO that they can own in the future\n\n**Revenue**\n\n- None until the TURF mint\n\n### Launch PRS (Paper Rock Scissors)\n\n👉 [Detailed proposal available here](https://www.notion.so/15b44a50d7f145fa97d7914c651b0492)\n\n**Summary**\n\n- PRS is a game of skill created in partnership with Tableland to demonstrate how scores can be stored in a decentralized manner, then composed with other games to give DOPE WARS assets value based on gameplay\n- We need to work out the tokenomics of this game to ensure we’re doing all we can to avoid gaming law scrutiny\n- Front-end work needs to be completed to host this game\n\n**Impact**\n\n- Hustlers have a game they can play using DOPE WARS Hustlers and PAPER\n\n**Revenue**\n\n- % of all entry fees goes back to the DAO\n- Potentially % of LP providing through contract could go back to the DAO\n\n### Launch Dope Bot on GCP\n\n**Summary**\n\n- The Dope Bot is a custom Discord bot that provides information, authentication verification, and NFT sales information to the community Discord. It’s currently hosted on Bort’s computer and needs a final push to be placed live on external hosting.\n\n**Impact**\n\n- Discord continues to receive up-to-date and on-demand information about NFT assets in a reliable manner.\n\n**Revenue**\n\n- None\n\n### Add Dope MMO Quests\n\n**Summary**\n\n- [DIP-41](https://www.notion.so/ec81b60eee64494b94abfc2d5293febc) hired hir0 to design quests for our DOPE MMO. The storylines are ready to go and need to be coded into the MMO so players can interact with them.\n- No coding has been completed to bring these quests to life.\n- Further exploration needs to be done, and a proper proposal put in place after the MMO is up and running to understand the effort needed to make this happen.\n\n**Impact**\n\n- NFT items can be won by Hustlers for completing quests\n- Our MMO becomes more immersive and sticky, beginning to create our gameplay loop that will engage players over the long run\n\n**Revenue**\n\n- None planned yet\n\n### TURF Mint + Drop\n\n👉 **[Discussion on Discord here](https://discord.com/channels/882333869007839252/952943487425327114)**\n\n**Summary**\n\n- TURF is the idea of NFT land ownership or rental in the DOPE MMO space.\n- Ownership of TURF would impact gameplay in DOPE WARS game experiences.\n- We have not come to an agreement about *****how TURF would work*****, or what tokenomics will work best with our community in the current market.\n\n**Impact**\n\n- Our best chance to generate revenue and excitement about future Dope Wars experiences\n- Our opportunity to phase out DOPE NFTs if we’d like\n\n**Revenue**\n\n- NFT mint fees\n\n### Fund exploration of a fighting game from Mr Fax and SohoJoe\n\n👉 [Detailed proposal available here](https://www.notion.so/69973afc6c8341aa87719a863862a8c8)\n\n**Summary**\n\n- Mr Fax would like to develop a fighting game set in the Dope Wars universe. Its gameplay will be fighting battles 1 vs. 1, inspired on games like “UrbanChampion”, “Street Fighter” & “Mortal Kombat”.\n- We want to create a fun, simple, playable game that Hustlers can interact with\n\n**Impact**\n\n- A playable game that people can interact with using DOPE WARS assets\n\n**Revenue**\n\n- None planned\n\n### Fund exploration of a 3d game from 187.ape\n\n👉 [Twitter post with sample video](https://twitter.com/187ape/status/1607287881244217346)\n\n**Summary**\n\n- 187.ape has been working independently to explore what a 3d game would look like set in the DOPE WARS universe\n- No formal proposal for compensation, timelines, or delivery expectations have been communicated\n\n**Impact**\n\n- A playable game that people can interact with using DOPE WARS assets\n\n****Revenue****\n\n- None planned",

      "content": "Subject:\n\nThis is a proposal for DopeDAO to give 8,000 OP tokens to 187.ape as a reward for the work that he has done to develop his game, tentatively titled “DopeWars Infiltration.” 187.ape has worked on his game on his own and he has not requested any funds from DopeDAO. The Optimism Foundation granted DopeDAO 150k OP tokens specifically to incentivize the development of games for the DopeWars ecosystem. If DopeDAO hopes to apply for another grant from the Optimism Foundation at some point in the future, DopeDAO will need to show that it used the OP tokens in the way that it promised in the grant application. Therefore, giving 8,000 OP tokens to 187.ape is the correct decision because it satisfies the terms of the grant from the Optimism Foundation, and because it rewards 187.ape for the hard, solitary work that he has done to develop his game and increase the value of the DopeWars ecosystem. Furthermore, rewarding 187.ape will send a message to other game developers that if they help build the DopeWars ecosystem, they will be fairly compensated for their efforts. \n\nBE IT RESOLVED THAT:\n\nDopeDAO will transfer 8,000 OP tokens to 187.ape.",

This agreement outlines how the DAO functions, how we govern and manage ourselves as a Member Managed Limited Liability Company. The content of this agreement is important to all Members of DOPE DAO. As described in the Operating Agreement, if you own a DOPE Token then you are a member of the DAO with Rights and Responsibilities. Amongst other things the agreement sets out the Purpose of the DAO, the Governance Mechanisms and some of the administrative burdens we are required to keep up. So it is important that all Members are conversant with this document.\n\nFor the purposes of undertaking the ‘ordinary and usual decisions concerning business affairs’ you will notice that the Operating Agreement describes the establishment of Core Units to complete these tasks. We can imagine the DAO as a “Permissionless” and “Autonomous” Ship at sea, and we all have a say toward where it is piloted via our portion of the 8000 DOPE Tokens. However, at this stage there is a manual requirement for some Members to take responsibility for ‘inputting’ these commands into the auto pilot dashboard up in the bridge. For example we need to effectively manage accounting and treasury requirements, community and community development as well as a portion of technical administration as we grow. The intent is that we will begin to implement this plan in short order to meet our obligations and build upon our emerging structural advancements.\n\nIf you would like to read up on the previous proposals that got this registration process underway please find the links here:\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/dopedao.eth/proposal/0xcabe03888d16157ad14ad6dc047f982823612e1c2d6754d14385e72fc5a57b87\n\nhttps://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0xDBd38F7e739709fe5bFaE6cc8eF67C3820830E0C/proposal/80745016675607650767307215452811717320727655451470881906169970936595641495821\n\nBut before we get too far ahead of ourselves! Of course, the first step is to run this Operating Agreement through our Official Proposal Process (OPP) – Yes I am Naughty by Nature. It is by virtue of community discourse and vote that we give this Agreement the Legitimacy it needs.\n\nPlease see the Operating Agreement at the link below:\n\nhttps://discordapp.com/channels/882333869007839252/1039562310240444506/1039562310240444506\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/d45ea7a6-bae7-424c-aec2-f182329bc731_400x400.jpg)\n\nThanks for reading all that Hustlers!\nThis is the final part of the OPP, as per the Operating Agreement that will execute this as our DOPE DAO OA. A big thank you for your patience on this matter DOPEFAM. Let’s get it started.\n\nKind Regards\nTaniela.Taki",

This will be our initial draft for the proposal discussion with the Optimism community and is subject to change following feedback..\n![swars.jpg](ipfs://bafkreifh764wjci5srdtl27sitqauukuqdvapcyuyl7txuo5n7ahlvp7am)\n ~Credit to OG Slayer for the meme\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nProject name: Dope Wars\n\nAuthor name and contact info:\n\nAuthor: Butterbum.eth, Sal Paradise (James) & Facesof.eth on behalf of Dope Wars DAO\n\nI understand that I will be required to provide additional KYC information to the Optimism Foundation to receive this grant: Yes\n\nL2 recipient address: 0x90103beDCfbE1eeE44ded89cEd88bA8503580b3D\n\nWhich Voting Cycle are you applying for? Season 2, Round 2\n\nGrant category: NFT / Gaming\n\nIs this proposal applicable to a specific committee?\nYes. NFT & Gaming Committee\n\nProject description:\n\nDope Wars is an open source metaverse project with a “Play-To-Own” model, featuring a plurality of games, experiences, and environments in our community-built ecosystem. The development ecosystem revolves around a gaming SDK, so contributors can seamlessly plug in different modules. Dope Wars began as a fork of Loot (For Adventurers), with a GTA-inspired spin.\n\nThe Ethereum mainnet DOPE NFT series launched as a free mint, with 9 items (GEAR) associated per NFT. The items are “unpackable” at the contract level, and we made the decision to build out the outputs of this feature on Optimism. Users are required to “claim” the gear which mints, or unpacks, the corresponding game items on the Optimism network as 9 unique ERC-1155s (GEAR), a function that can only be called once per DOPE NFT.\n\nThese items can then be equipped to a HUSTLER (playable character) to interact with our Dope Wars MMO and its modules, we anticipate primarily in the form of mini-games. Unequipped Hustlers are free to mint, and can be customized by trading for GEAR on Quix, allowing anyone to participate in our MMO metaverse and mini-games.\n\nDope Wars is currently executing on a two-part internal governance proposal which has passed by unanimous decision on both Snapshot Part1, Part2 and Tally P1, P2 in favor of registering Dope Wars as a Not for Profit Limited Liability Company under representation from MIDAO. As defined by the DW Operating Agreement, DOPE holders are stakeholders with varying levels of contribution that can be remunerated for their efforts as valued by the DAO by way of onchain Tally vote decree. This marks a major milestone in protecting builders contributing to the Dope Wars ecosystem and sets the legal foundation for further growth of the project and acceptance of grants such as this.\n\nIt is important to note that since inception, Dope Wars has followed the standards of a “Public Good,” beginning with the free mint, and continuing with a rigid policy of open source and transparent building led by members of the community. Anyone with the chops is able to join the community and grow the project.\n \n![DW Alpha screenshot.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreia77jwufpnoaheenis3znl4jjfjgbi3eaed5iueorrgvrwp7e6o3y)\n~Snapshot from Dope Wars MMO Alpha Testing\n\n\nProject links:\n\nWebsite\nGithub\nTwitter\nDiscord\nTally\nSnapshot\n\nAdditional contributors info (please link):\n\nCyberbitz.eth -Marketing and community lead\nFacesof.eth - Designer, developer\nTarrence.eth 1 - Solidity developer\nHPMNK - game designer\nTaniela.taki 2 - community developer\nLarko - game developer\nDennison Bertram - Launched the Dope NFT, though not currently an active contributor\n\nMr. Fax - Pixel art designer\n\nPlease link to any previous projects the contributors has meaningfully contributed to:\n\nTarrence.eth - cartridge.gg, Github, Tally\nHPMNK - Avoidania, Frens Lands\nDennison Bertram - Tally\n\nRelevant usage metrics:\n\nHUSTLERS: (OP) 3700 unique addresses. 6th highest all time volume on Quix\nOG Hustlers: Floor price on quix: 1 ETH\n\nDOPE GEAR: (OP) 18,100 ERC-1155s on Optimism. 4,600 sales on Quix with a volume of ~100 ETH. 25th highest volume on Quix all time.\n\nDOPE NFT (ETH): 2000 Unique addresses, 3500 ETH volume on OpenSea\n\nCompetitors, peers, or similar projects:**\n\nDope Wars is a unique project and has no known competitors utilizing NFTs with interchangeable items on OP.\n\nDW began as a fork of Loot (for Adventurers) but with a street/hip-hop culture motif.\nArbitrum’s Magic has competitive similarities in that it is a gaming hub and protocol.\nWorldwide Web3 has a similar MMO to what Dope Wars is building.\n\nIs this project open sourced? Yes, Dope Wars has created a Gaming protocol and is available for anyone to review and build upon. Github repo\n\nOptimism native?: No, Dope NFT contract deployed on Ethereum mainnet on 31 Aug 2021. However, through the process of claiming GEAR, and equipping HUSTLERS, the intention is to progressively move the bulk of our NFT transactional to Optimism, and we expect this to increase further based on the Optimism-based releases discussed in greater detail below.\n\nDate of deployment/expected deployment on Optimism: 20th Nov 2021 our HUSTLER contracts were deployed on Optimism.\n\nEcosystem Value Proposition:\n\nWhat is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the Optimism ecosystem?\nA primary objective of the Optimistic Vision is to move the world towards a system where collectivism and collaboration are encouraged and equitably rewarded. This Vision has many facets, and Dope Wars is currently poised to focus on two critical, correlated components: user growth and network utilization.\n\nHow does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?\nThrough incentives for playing our games and interacting with our assets, we will expose new users to the OP community and increase transactions on the OP network.\nBuilding games is resource intensive. As a self-funded project, Dope Wars has a strong foundation composed of a committed community, veteran core contributors, and existing game assets but needs a bit more resources to push us over the edge in order to bring some of these elements to market. Open collaboration is a hallmark of Dope Wars. This grant would stimulate a cycle of equitable collaboration that we plan to extend into the indefinite future through a self-sustaining gaming protocol. Our combination of a central MMO, a related SDK and DAO funding mechanisms are integral to this, designed to encourage and support future builders. With the primary MMO game on Optimism, this grant would encourage building future games on Optimism, fostering self-sustaining loops of user growth and network engagement.\n\nWhy will this solution be a source of growth for the Optimism ecosystem?\nGaming is currently underrepresented in the OP ecosystem- an essentially untapped market. Blockchain gaming activity has increased 2000% since the start of the year, representing 52% of all blockchain activity (https://dappradar.com/blog/dappradar-x-bga-games-report-q1-2022). Grand Theft Auto V is the second best selling game of all time, thus this genre has proven appeal and a huge total addressable market. Onchain games in general have proven to be a powerful framework to build communities, and our games are structurally designed to increase network activity. With tens-of-thousands of assets already trading on OP, and multiple games and experiences in the pipeline that integrate these assets into onchain games, DW uses entertainment to bring activity to the OP network.\nWe also plan to continue to contribute to charitable causes related to our theme, as we have already done through a collaboration with NBA star Baron Davis’s charity, further bringing fresh eyes to Optimism.\n$PAPER, our ERC-20 token that was airdropped to DOPE NFT holders in September 2021, serves as the in-game currency when bridged to Optimism. $PAPER has been listed on Coinbase Custody, and was named in a short list for a full service Coinbase listing earlier this year- another avenue to potentially increase exposure to Optimism.\nHas your project previously applied for an OP grant?\n\nYes, unsuccessfully. Dope Wars received detailed feedback from prominent OP delegates in our previous proposal, which we have considered when making this new proposal. We have significantly reduced the amount of OP requested and adjusted our developer incentives allocation. The previous draft proposal and discussion is here: https://gov.optimism.io/t/draft-gf-phase-1-proposal-dope-wars/2722/101\n\nNumber of OP tokens requested: 400,000\n\nProposal for token distribution:\n\nHow will the OP tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.)\nOver what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.\n\nThe most imminent goal for this Optimism distribution is to incentivize users to interact with Dope Wars mini-games. Currently there are a number of experiences being built by different community members, of which three are at or near completion: $PAPER Rock Scissors, Dope Frenzy and the MMO metaverse MVP.\n\n18.75% (75,000 OP) will be used to incentivize use and increase exposure of PRS (PAPER Rock Scissors). This mini-game is fully on-chain and built around the use of $PAPER. 100% of this allocation will be distributed as user rewards to players of PRS via weekly and monthly competitions over a 12-week period.\n\n18.75% (75,000 OP) will be used for Dope Frenzy. This is a single-player mayhem experience which requires OP $PAPER to play and integrates OP GEAR to level up the experience. Development is self-funded by Community and Marketing Lead, Cyberbitz. 100% of OP in this allocation will be distributed to players via weekly and monthly competitions over a 12 week period.\n\n25% (100,000 OP) will be reserved for incentives in the OP based DOPE MMO metaverse experience, currently being built by Dope Wars contributors. The tokens will be distributed for executing in-game actions like participating in quests and playing mini-games. These incentives will become active when DOPE MMO metaverse is launched in the near future. It is difficult to give a precise date as to when it will be launched as we are an open source DAO with many moving parts. We would like to request this allocation now in order to utilize the OP at the launch of the MMO.\n\n37.5% (150,000 OP) will be used to incentivize development of games, experiences and smart contracts. Dope Wars DAO will utilize these funds in a responsible manner to allow Dope Wars to flourish into the communities’ vision. We are a fully community-owned project and no external capital has been received. This allocation would also help to onboard new developers to our Play-to-Own gaming hub, and collectively produce many entertaining games and environments for Optimism users. Dope Wars has a strong verifiable precedent of retroactively rewarding (bounty) contributors via onchain community vote. As one example, here is a proposal for funding including proposed budget, followed by the corresponding successful vote for disbursement here a few months later. We feel that this precedent strengthens our case for responsibly and effectively managing project growth through contributor incentives. The breakdown per contributor incentive vertical is as follows:\n20k - Swap Meet 2 deployment\n30k - Paper Rock Scissors launch\n70k - MMO MVP release. Community alpha testing has already been held.\n30k - reserved to incentivize the next wave of community-built experiences, some of which have already been heavily iterated upon, including $TURF, our own customizable virtual land baked into the MMO, which is already deep into the interface design process.\n\nPlease list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on Optimism. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable.\n\nMilestones\nDeployment of PAPER Rock Scissors on Optimism and related user competition for $OP\nRelease of Dope Frenzy and related user competition for $OP\nRelease of MVP MMO\nDeployment of Swap Meet 2\n \n![testing.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreigaxyir2gze24fx5vuzepkbssghigqagiviuln7if2w4okuon3yma)\n~Dope Frenzy aim mechanics testing\n\nWhy will incentivized users and liquidity on Optimism remain after incentives dry up?\n\nPost incentives, we will have a virtual world with an increasing amount of onchain mini-games and collector experiences, creating a flywheel where users and contributors become owners of a virtual economy on the Optimism network.\n\nPlease provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability\n\nAll progress is trackable on Github at https://github.com/dopedao\nEthereum Mainnet contracts and links\n\nDope NFT~ERC-721 contract, Fork of Loot protocol: https://etherscan.io/token/0x8707276df042e89669d69a177d3da7dc78bd8723\nPAPER~ERC-20 contract, Dope Wars official eco-system currency: https://etherscan.io/token/0x7ae1d57b58fa6411f32948314badd83583ee0e8c\nDope NFT collection: https://www.gem.xyz/collection/dope-v4/\nSmart contract Treasury address : https://etherscan.io/address/0xb57ab8767cae33be61ff15167134861865f7d22c\nDope Wars fund tracker: https://dope-wars.notion.site/3d285ff9ef5640f3bad61e692692c279?v=317640d832d64170b6255c8e2d1353ac\nOptimism contracts and links\n\nGear~ERC-1155: https://qx.app/collection/gear\nHustlers~ERC-1155: https://qx.app/collection/hustlers\nHustlers contract: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xdbfeaae58b6da8901a8a40ba0712beb2ee18368e\nSwap contract: https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xdbfeaae58b6da8901a8a40ba0712beb2ee18368e\nDisclaimer\n\nAs Butterbum.eth is an author of this Dope Wars proposal and also a member of the NFT & Gaming Committee, they shall abstain in participating in the review and recommendation of this proposal.

      "title": "DOPE DAO TAKES TO THE HIGH SEAS",
      "content": "A PROPOSAL TO REGISTER THE DAO AS A LEGAL ENTITY\n\nPART 2\n\nAs discussed in Part 1 DOPE DAO currently has no structure as a legal entity and therefore no limit on liability for its members. The prevailing wisdom amongst many current DAO ventures suggests that this issue should be addressed to create a legitimate platform from which to conduct activities. This has been confirmed by our consultation with Mr Thomas Plunkett. We cannot properly expect to have a flourishing ecosystem and DAO if members are concerned about varying levels of unfettered legal liability.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/2a84133c-33d1-4ae5-b596-b30bc1186544_400x400.jpg)\n\nWe can solve this by registering the DAO as a Not for Profit Limited Liability Company with MIDAO in the Marshall Islands. This would mean that any legal challenge seeking redress in the future would be limited to obtaining redress from assets owned by the DAO. Individual DAO members’ personal assets would be protected. This is a good thing. This will allow us to navigate our way through the uncertain territory applying best practice and due diligence as we determine, while still having a backstop of limited liability to protect us in case the situation changes on us. This will allow us freedom of action without having to worry whether we are exposing any of our members to undue risk. \nI can hear the cry’s already! I don’t want DOPEWARS to be not for profit! Don’t be alarmed — a Not for Profit LLC can still makes tonnes of money, all its assets can raise in value we just have to ensure that DOPEWARS never pays ‘dividends’ to DOPE Holders. This has never been part of this vision for DOPEWARS anyway so it’s no trouble. Furthermore, the DAO once registered as a Legal Entity will not be taxed by the Marshall Islands Government. This is not to say that individual members will not be responsible for fulfilling their own unique tax obligations separate from the DAO, of course they still will. But with a bit of luck and some sound development we might all be able to fly jets to a DOPEWARS convention at a beautiful tropical island like this:\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/5bffb5cc-4edc-4ce6-884a-de61741e6c49_400x400.jpg)\n\nThe background for MIDAO in the Marshall Islands is an interesting story. The Marshall Islands is home to many shipping companies because they have laws that are favourable. DAO’s and Ships have similarities; they don’t necessarily belong to any nation floating out in international waters. The Marshall Islands is a sovereign nation but is a protectorate of the USA. The benefit of independent law while having the security of protection of the US. The nimble government of Marshal Islands have seized the opportunity to create legislation that specifically enables DAO’s to become LLC’s. Purpose built law that references Smart Contracts as governance mechanisms and Token Holders as members. \nMIDAO is a registered agent in the Marshall Islands. Some of their members actually helped the Marshall Islands Government pass the abovementioned laws. To give an indication of timeframe, all this was put into action last year. So as you can see it is frontier type stuff, which we love here at DOPEWARS. However it is important to note that 40+ NYSE and NASDAQ companies and 20% of the world’s shipping capacity are registered in the Marshall Islands, so it’s not an uncommon place to base our business. Bleeding edge shizzle as usual, but not without a bit of street smart hustle.\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/4252af8f-8b94-4808-8431-05a94f423389_400x400.jpg)\n\nPart of the beauty of specifically created legislation is that members are allowed to be described as wallet addresses that hold a particular token. For example in our scenario, a wallet address that holds a DOPE token can be recognised. This means that we bypass the requirement for registration of personal information of DAO members. Provided that the individual in question does not own 10% or more of the DOPE tokens, there is no requirement for them to KYC. No one person in DOPEDAO owns 10% or more of the governance token so we are enabled to preserve our anonymity whilst still being a protected member of the DAO and LLC.  Pretty neat huh! Let’s turn our DAO into a Ship!! A pirate ship of course… \n![](https://static.tally.xyz/f1b8be9e-d9ea-482b-b808-bf78e3c44404_400x400.jpg)\n\nThe process would require the creation of an Operating Agreement which describes how we operate and govern ourselves as a DAO. I can write this Operating Agreement up in conjunction with the MIDAO Staff who have a Lawyer heavy team. Our DAO is then registered as a LLC turning it into a legal entity. There is the requirement that one DAO member is DOXED and KYC’s. The mighty Don Cyberbitz has presented a solution for this and I salute him for his efforts.\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/183e7a4a-bacc-4615-be01-1d3766dd635e_400x400.jpg)\n\nThere is a cost, the details are as below:\nOne time Registration Fee:  $9,500.00 USD (payable in Crypto).\nAnnual Administration Fee:  1% of DAO Revenue ($3,000.00 minimum & $15,000.00 maximum), payable each calendar year due in the following January. In the first year the amount payable would only be representative of Revenue after we received our charter of registration.  So for example if we registered later this year then the Revenue calculation would only apply from then until January 2023. This annual administration fee will mean we have to submit a proposal to pay the fee when it is due in January. \nThis administration fee pays for\n1.\tGovernment fees\n2.\tRegistered agent service (address in Marshall Islands, maintenance of documents.)\n3.\tAnnual filing facilitation.\n4.\tCompliance costs (MIDAO do on-chain analysis to make sure there is no money laundering or support to nefarious organisation action going on, which is another added layer of protection for us).\n\n\n\nIn closing I would comment that, here at DOPE WARS, we are not your average run of the mill generic NFT Project. We have elements of our project that give it a certain edge. This is part of what attracts many to the scene making it cool and interesting.\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/7fc46132-8e18-44cf-8a0e-2a81c3800b50_400x400.jpg)\n\nOf course it goes without saying that we, here at DOPE DAO, are well intentioned and collectively desire to create a fun and engaging project and community. This does not, or at least should not, preclude us from being well prepared and protected in case the unexpected happens. \n![](https://static.tally.xyz/7f3d3b19-0667-4fc0-9249-95545b42757d_400x400.jpg)\n\nI hope poor Mr Hika was similarly sensible and took up the DOPE WARS Actors Union Medical Coverage Offer…\n\nSo without further ado, I propose that we vote to determine whether we take to the HIGH SEAS with MIDAO in the Marshall Islands. This is an important vote DOPEFAM, if we do think this is a good idea then the higher the voter turn-out the better. The more widespread the voting then the more legit the result is. \n\nShall we register DOPEDAO as a Not for Profit Limited Liability Company with MIDAO in the Marshall Islands and authorise the release of $9500 USD worth of ETH to be paid to MIDAO?\n\nTaniela.Taki\n",

      "title": "TIME TO CALL SAUL",
      "content": "TIME TO CALL SAUL\n\nA PROPOSAL TO SECURE THE LEGAL FOOTING OF DOPEDAO\n \nPART 1\n\nI have done extensive research into the legal standing of our DAO and in fact DAO’s in general. There are many complicated legal considerations and the truth is that, although some aspects are clear cut, the larger picture is unprecedented and dependent on uncertain potential future variables. Given the challenging nature of the DAO with the difficulties presented by the decentralization I believe it is the right time for DOPE DAO to CALL SAUL and set us up for success in a prudent fashion. \nhttps://static.tally.xyz/83c35959-20ec-4919-a43c-b3ff51192b32_400x400.jpg\n\nIn line with this, DOPE DAO has been in consultation with a renowned crypto lawyer Mr Thomas Plunkett. As you can see from the picture below Mr Plunkett is well versed in the Crypto world and Crypto Law, to the point that he teaches University level Crypto related papers that he has developed. We were fortunate enough to have this contact given to us by a well-connected hustler and member of the DOPE DAO.\nhttps://static.tally.xyz/d2cac969-0920-46e9-9ca0-f5e782e913ff_400x400.jpg\n\nCurrently DOPE DAO is an amorphous entity. There is no structure by which any contesting body can latch onto to hold it accountable for any particular reason. The reasons for someone/something wanting to pursue DOPE WARS legally could be numerous — A scam, hack, rug, trademark or copyright issues, tax issues etc. the list goes on.\nTherefore it remains a possibility that each person who is a voting member of the DAO could be targeted as liable for the actions of the DAO. This lines up with recent case law that is attempting to define DAO’s with no legal structure as General Partnerships. General Partnerships have no limit on personal liability; personal assets of individual members are exposed. Equally, each member would be potentially liable for the actions of another DAO member. I’m not sure about ya’ll but I certainly don’t want to be liable for all of the shenanigans that any hustler might get themselves mixed up in! This problem area was confirmed during our one hour complimentary consultation with Mr Plunkett.\nhttps://static.tally.xyz/282ec128-4bfd-4468-b0a6-421232a321e2_400x400.jpg\n\nBecause of this, I do believe it is in our best interests to obtain a wrap-around future proof protection for our DAO. There have been a few areas of concern highlighted. Having discussed the entirety of them with the good lawyer we have managed to ascertain that it would be prohibitively expensive to engage legal counsel upon all legal issues that haunt DOPEWARS and Crypto in general! (The first quote was 75k USD!)\nWe have managed to whittle down the areas of concern to the most important and most pressing so we can affordably address the issue. They are defined below as part of a quote provided to us for the provision of 20k USD worth of legal work. \n1.\tLEGAL ENTITY FORMATION OPINION LETTER\nThis comes as a recommendation of which Legal Entity is best suited to the DOPE WARS ecosystem. The creation of this Legal Entity will form a separate proposal as PART 2 of this effort.\n\n2. DAO OPERATING AGREEMENTS\nA.\tTHE DAO would like a SOFTWARE OPERATING AGREEMENT to be put in place which limits liability from people interacting with the dopewars.gg website\nB.\tTHE DAO requests a CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT to be issued to anyone performing services, which clearly states the 3rd party is performing work, but THE DAO owns the created content.\n3. GAMING LEGAL OPINION\nTHE DAO is seeking to create games hosted on the website dopewars.gg, which allow players to compete against one another using NFT assets, pay entry fees in our ERC20 token PAPER, and receive tokens back depending on the outcome of those games.\nThe first game of this nature is called PAPER ROCK SCISSORS. The idea is that anyone can pay a token entry fee of whatever ERC20 token they have, which is swapped for the ERC20 token PAPER.\nDepending on the outcome of the game, one winner is selected and receives 95% of the entry fees from both contestants, with the remaining 5% going back into THE DAO treasury to maintain the open-source gaming protocol, and incentivize other builders to create games of a similar nature. The opinion will direct us to the proper processes to follow for this game, and future games, so as to comply with relevant laws, for example gambling laws/regulations.\n4. OPINION ON USAGE OF THE TREASURY\nBased on the above facts, THE DAO would like to understand what can be done with tokens in the treasury. Usage of the tokens should avoid having any of them being classified as a security by the SEC.\nOutstanding questions\t\n•\tWhat can the ETH and PAPER in THE DAO treasury be used for? \n•\tCan these tokens be swapped for other tokens?\n•\tCan they be used to provide liquidity, and collect fees on that liquidity?\n•\tCan they be granted to benefactors of THE DAO for donations?\n•\tCan they be “sold” in any way?\nhttps://static.tally.xyz/125234b2-4367-4c0d-9c48-7f945c57a4d1_400x400.jpg\n\nThe above mentioned issues form the content of this first proposal. A proposal that we vote to release 20k USD worth of ETH that will be used to pay Mr Thomas Plunkett for the legal counsel as described above. The clarification of these legal issues will not only steer us in the right direction but will also provide invaluable evidence that we are conducting proper due diligence operating on the best available advice at the time. Once we have this coverage combined with the creation of a legal entity as defined in Part 2, we will be in a very good position to continue to build with the sound knowledge that we are pursuing legitimate purpose. \nhttps://static.tally.xyz/c0e56a11-af25-442c-ad63-a76133534fa5_400x400.jpg\n\nThe vote is a simple YES/NO.\n\nTaniela.Taki\n",

Have some loyalty, love it or leave it. \n3.\tRespect the Hustle, but respect the GM – ‘nuff said.\n4.\tHistory stays where it should. — The history of the Hustle may have been grimey and many will not know the whole story. We must learn from mistakes but a hustler looks to the future and doesn’t dwell on the past.\n5.\tReputation; All you have in this world is your word and your digi-balls, don’t break ‘em for nobody — In this high trust, limited accountability environment your word is your bond, if you say you are going to do something, do it. \n6.\tDon’t get high off your own supply — One DOPE equals ONE vote, all hustlers deserve to be heard. \n7.\tPay your Pizzo — 5% to the DAO. \n\nFollow these rules and you’ll have mad bread to break up..\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifxo4fudll7grdsdyp4qpks3uavs6whujpwsk467bvbmh2b4tiqda)\n    \nTHE HITMANS CREED:\nBorn from the Hustle, I am a soldier of the MURDERVERSE.\nI am loyal to the needs of my fellow HUSTLERS.\nI embody the Spirit of GM.\nI am committed to providing a SAFU and INCLUSIVE environment that fosters creativity and team work.\nWith professionalism I serve to enhance and protect DOPEWARS’ fine reputation.\nI will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy this DOPE NATION.\nAnd you will know I am the HITMAN when I lay my vengeance upon you.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihmeu4l5bhopxdpehnblgi2xbi6qmtdpyi27n6uu6zvfon7o3snda)\n    \nI propose that we adopt this Code of Conduct for DOPEDAO Members and appoint two Moderators (HITMEN), SPRTN and SLASHER. A HITMAN would be responsible for accurate communications in the form of small regular updates from the Contributors out to community, and responsible for maintaining/enforcing the Code. This will ensure that the community stays informed with the status of the DAO in an accurate way. In line with the responsibility I propose that we pay each HITMAN 150k $PAPER per month for their work over a three month trial period. \n\nAs a show of good faith to the community I propose that we re-instate the Telegram chat which has been missed by a number of Hustlers as a low key place where they can hang out and shoot the shit about DOPEWARS related stuff in a lighter hearted manner. I believe that if we address the issue of accurate communications and enforce the code then we will have solved the problem which led us to shutting down Telegram.\n\nThis proposal is a simple YES/NO\n\nTaniela.Taki\n",

      "title": "DOPE DAO TAKES TO THE HIGH SEAS",
      "content": "As discussed in Part 1 DOPE DAO currently has no structure as a legal entity and therefore no limit on liability for its members. The prevailing wisdom amongst many current DAO ventures suggests that this issue should be addressed to create a legitimate platform from which to conduct activities. This has been confirmed by our consultation with Mr Thomas Plunkett. We cannot properly expect to have a flourishing ecosystem and DAO if members are concerned about varying levels of unfettered legal liability.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifc35rbsc3t76imj6laupbk6pqyjkgywicpj6z2smnzoik6gztwcm)\n    \nWe can solve this by registering the DAO as a Not for Profit Limited Liability Company with MIDAO in the Marshall Islands. This would mean that any legal challenge seeking redress in the future would be limited to obtaining redress from assets owned by the DAO. Individual DAO members’ personal assets would be protected. This is a good thing. This will allow us to navigate our way through the uncertain territory applying best practice and due diligence as we determine, while still having a backstop of limited liability to protect us in case the situation changes on us. This will allow us freedom of action without having to worry whether we are exposing any of our members to undue risk. \nI can hear the cry’s already! I don’t want DOPEWARS to be not for profit! Don’t be alarmed — a Not for Profit LLC can still makes tonnes of money, all its assets can raise in value we just have to ensure that DOPEWARS never pays ‘dividends’ to DOPE Holders. This has never been part of this vision for DOPEWARS anyway so it’s no trouble. Furthermore, the DAO once registered as a Legal Entity will not be taxed by the Marshall Islands Government. This is not to say that individual members will not be responsible for fulfilling their own unique tax obligations separate from the DAO, of course they still will. But with a bit of luck and some sound development we might all be able to fly jets to a DOPEWARS convention at a beautiful tropical island like this:\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigvofwd33wwqbynksijq2airznzqs3e33fgurim44ou4nqmsx254y)\n    \nThe background for MIDAO in the Marshall Islands is an interesting story. The Marshall Islands is home to many shipping companies because they have laws that are favourable. DAO’s and Ships have similarities; they don’t necessarily belong to any nation floating out in international waters. The Marshall Islands is a sovereign nation but is a protectorate of the USA. The benefit of independent law while having the security of protection of the US. The nimble government of Marshal Islands have seized the opportunity to create legislation that specifically enables DAO’s to become LLC’s. Purpose built law that references Smart Contracts as governance mechanisms and Token Holders as members. \n\nMIDAO is a registered agent in the Marshall Islands. Some of their members actually helped the Marshall Islands Government pass the abovementioned laws. To give an indication of timeframe, all this was put into action last year. So as you can see it is frontier type stuff, which we love here at DOPEWARS. However it is important to note that 40+ NYSE and NASDAQ companies and 20% of the world’s shipping capacity are registered in the Marshall Islands, so it’s not an uncommon place to base our business. Bleeding edge shizzle as usual, but not without a bit of street smart hustle.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiergzhwxy4spqjuaqcrpna6mqkg7kybqbbxuul22dvxqb7g5dbqye)\n    \nPart of the beauty of specifically created legislation is that members are allowed to be described as wallet addresses that hold a particular token. For example in our scenario, a wallet address that holds a DOPE token can be recognised. This means that we bypass the requirement for registration of personal information of DAO members. Provided that the individual in question does not own 10% or more of the DOPE tokens, there is no requirement for them to KYC. No one person in DOPEDAO owns 10% or more of the governance token so we are enabled to preserve our anonymity whilst still being a protected member of the DAO and LLC.  Pretty neat huh! Let’s turn our DAO into a Ship!! A pirate ship of course… \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiayzf54yz4rih7bonajy4abqdzupsiszb56th53cbomuecpacmcbq)\n    \nThe process would require the creation of an Operating Agreement which describes how we operate and govern ourselves as a DAO. I can write this Operating Agreement up in conjunction with the MIDAO Staff who have a Lawyer heavy team. Our DAO is then registered as a LLC turning it into a legal entity. There is the requirement that one DAO member is DOXED and KYC’s. The mighty Don Cyberbitz has presented a solution for this and I salute him for his efforts.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigxymzmcdy7maxq2y6osoxn4vqokyhs5u4sjj6j2yf3xpwhnfjllm)\n    \nThere is a cost, the details are as below:\nOne time Registration Fee:  $9,500.00 USD (payable in Crypto).\nAnnual Administration Fee:  1% of DAO Revenue ($3,000.00 minimum & $15,000.00 maximum), payable each calendar year due in the following January. In the first year the amount payable would only be representative of Revenue after we received our charter of registration.  So for example if we registered later this year then the Revenue calculation would only apply from then until January 2023. This annual administration fee will mean we have to submit a proposal to pay the fee when it is due in January. \nThis administration fee pays for\n1.\tGovernment fees\n2.\tRegistered agent service (address in Marshall Islands, maintenance of documents.)\n3.\tAnnual filing facilitation.\n4.\tCompliance costs (MIDAO do on-chain analysis to make sure there is no money laundering or support to nefarious organisation action going on, which is another added layer of protection for us).\n\nIn closing I would comment that, here at DOPE WARS, we are not your average run of the mill generic NFT Project. We have elements of our project that give it a certain edge. This is part of what attracts many to the scene making it cool and interesting.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiebnizkcigugzj2zmksn5yd6ri7poyxdijv3bteuu6wtg6zzmolae)\n    \nOf course it goes without saying that we, here at DOPE DAO, are well intentioned and collectively desire to create a fun and engaging project and community. This does not, or at least should not, preclude us from being well prepared and protected in case the unexpected happens. \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiac4rbukhrczhtilyu6kqivv6fsblzmkwb6c7jms5ckf67kn5qf7q)\n    \nI hope poor Mr Hika was similarly sensible and took up the DOPE WARS Actors Union Medical Coverage Offer…\n\nSo without further ado, I propose that we vote to determine whether we take to the HIGH SEAS with MIDAO in the Marshall Islands. This is an important vote DOPEFAM, if we do think this is a good idea then the higher the voter turn-out the better. The more widespread the voting then the more legit the result is. \n\nShall we register DOPEDAO as a Not for Profit Limited Liability Company with MIDAO in the Marshall Islands and authorise the release of $9500 USD worth of ETH to be paid to MIDAO?\n\nYES/NO\n\nTaniela.Taki\n",

      "title": "TIME TO CALL SAUL",
      "content": "A PROPOSAL TO SECURE THE LEGAL FOOTING OF DOPEDAO \n\nPART 1\n\nI have done extensive research into the legal standing of our DAO and in fact DAO’s in general. There are many complicated legal considerations and the truth is that, although some aspects are clear cut, the larger picture is unprecedented and dependent on uncertain potential future variables. Given the challenging nature of the DAO with the difficulties presented by the decentralization I believe it is the right time for DOPE DAO to CALL SAUL and set us up for success in a prudent fashion. \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreie5beklijtb5wt6bswwwrovnbsi6qzbvoedfmdyfak2ypgtwrej3q)\n    \nIn line with this, DOPE DAO has been in consultation with a renowned crypto lawyer Mr Thomas Plunkett. As you can see from the picture below Mr Plunkett is well versed in the Crypto world and Crypto Law, to the point that he teaches University level Crypto related papers that he has developed. We were fortunate enough to have this contact given to us by a well-connected hustler and member of the DOPE DAO.\n \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreie2e5ovoepy6bo2h6i26q3z7gjmfhtyyqiwvbqmtwaguoj4zhpvey)\n    \n\nCurrently DOPE DAO is an amorphous entity. There is no structure by which any contesting body can latch onto to hold it accountable for any particular reason. The reasons for someone/something wanting to pursue DOPE WARS legally could be numerous — A scam, hack, rug, trademark or copyright issues, tax issues etc. the list goes on.\nTherefore it remains a possibility that each person who is a voting member of the DAO could be targeted as liable for the actions of the DAO. This lines up with recent case law that is attempting to define DAO’s with no legal structure as General Partnerships. General Partnerships have no limit on personal liability; personal assets of individual members are exposed. Equally, each member would be potentially liable for the actions of another DAO member. I’m not sure about ya’ll but I certainly don’t want to be liable for all of the shenanigans that any hustler might get themselves mixed up in! This problem area was confirmed during our one hour complimentary consultation with Mr Plunkett.\n \n \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihrx4i3fpj2rkhflgak3fybl6jo36wanv57cigzcy6eeputy62u44)\n    \n    \n\nBecause of this, I do believe it is in our best interests to obtain a wrap-around future proof protection for our DAO. There have been a few areas of concern highlighted. Having discussed the entirety of them with the good lawyer we have managed to ascertain that it would be prohibitively expensive to engage legal counsel upon all legal issues that haunt DOPEWARS and Crypto in general! (The first quote was 75k USD!)\nWe have managed to whittle down the areas of concern to the most important and most pressing so we can affordably address the issue. They are defined below as part of a quote provided to us for the provision of 20k USD worth of legal work. \n1.\tLEGAL ENTITY FORMATION OPINION LETTER\nThis comes as a recommendation of which Legal Entity is best suited to the DOPE WARS ecosystem. The creation of this Legal Entity will form a separate proposal as PART 2 of this effort.\n\n2. DAO OPERATING AGREEMENTS\nA.\tTHE DAO would like a SOFTWARE OPERATING AGREEMENT to be put in place which limits liability from people interacting with the dopewars.gg website\nB.\tTHE DAO requests a CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT to be issued to anyone performing services, which clearly states the 3rd party is performing work, but THE DAO owns the created content.\n3. GAMING LEGAL OPINION\nTHE DAO is seeking to create games hosted on the website dopewars.gg, which allow players to compete against one another using NFT assets, pay entry fees in our ERC20 token PAPER, and receive tokens back depending on the outcome of those games.\nThe first game of this nature is called PAPER ROCK SCISSORS. The idea is that anyone can pay a token entry fee of whatever ERC20 token they have, which is swapped for the ERC20 token PAPER.\nDepending on the outcome of the game, one winner is selected and receives 95% of the entry fees from both contestants, with the remaining 5% going back into THE DAO treasury to maintain the open-source gaming protocol, and incentivize other builders to create games of a similar nature. The opinion will direct us to the proper processes to follow for this game, and future games, so as to comply with relevant laws, for example gambling laws/regulations.\n4. OPINION ON USAGE OF THE TREASURY\nBased on the above facts, THE DAO would like to understand what can be done with tokens in the treasury. Usage of the tokens should avoid having any of them being classified as a security by the SEC.\nOutstanding questions\t\n•\tWhat can the ETH and PAPER in THE DAO treasury be used for? \n•\tCan these tokens be swapped for other tokens?\n•\tCan they be used to provide liquidity, and collect fees on that liquidity?\n•\tCan they be granted to benefactors of THE DAO for donations?\n•\tCan they be “sold” in any way?\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiepimeqhrasapgbuyo4wccl63iofxgau5pgcmyl6lhowh42xiwx5i)\n    \nThe above mentioned issues form the content of this first proposal. A proposal that we vote to release 20k USD worth of ETH that will be used to pay Mr Thomas Plunkett for the legal counsel as described above. The clarification of these legal issues will not only steer us in the right direction but will also provide invaluable evidence that we are conducting proper due diligence operating on the best available advice at the time. Once we have this coverage combined with the creation of a legal entity as defined in Part 2, we will be in a very good position to continue to build with the sound knowledge that we are pursuing legitimate purpose. \n \n \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreien3pvbmcxuohzj47ejev4ouksgbxza6nmlxznmsqamfo6uribpzm)\n    \n    \n\nThe vote is a simple YES/NO.\n\n\n",

I will attempt to explain in plain speak what it is.\n\nThe contract that created $Paper was made to be subordinate to the Governing contract (DOPE). It was made like this to ensure that when the DAO voted to confirm a function then the immutability of the block chain/smart contract would automatically execute the function. You can think of it like the DOPE contract being the ‘Don’ and the $Paper contract being the ‘hit-man’. Once the Don has issued a command to the hit-man, from thereon it’s not personal, it’s just business. \n  \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiflet4slrn3wbta5vrmgxkfs7yxd2a46bg4pkhxv67fixkjf2ub4u)\n    \n    \nIn the same way that the Don can release the hit-man from his oath of service, we can vote on a Tally proposal that will renounce the DOPE contract ownership of the $Paper contract. This would be achieved by transferring (renouncing) that ownership to a dead address or burning as it is commonly known and called. \n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifduhfbblnwm2oclfjixdc5mkcqtwil6qvedpdz6ossybfciby2nm)\n    \nSo as you can see it is not just a matter of flicking a switch to turn it off. This is an important distinction because relinquishing ownership of the $Paper contract means we, as a DAO, would no longer have control of it. This would mean we can no longer command it to inflate as we have just done. But it would also mean we could not command it to achieve other outcomes. I (we the core contributors) assess that this would not be a major barrier preventing us from achieving any success. We have solved the major problem of having no assets for the DAO with the mint we have just completed. \n \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigeeiuwzpbpfxo7exrvqxe5z4gsynj5vc2cbembef2biilw5caabu)\n    \n\nThere is the matter of the optics to consider. Renouncement of control could potentially look less than ideal to some people in the sense that it is kind of like a vote of no confidence in the governance structures ability to make savvy decisions. But in the same breath I would add that, to others, the optics would look desirable in the sense that it is a shot of confidence to the tokens integrity.

Takes a lot more time but it’s also very interesting as it is complex. Here’s an example of the logical we can use.\nThe idea of these districts is to allow players to gather into small communities and have their own place into the Metaverse to invite people to.\n\nEstimation of the time : Around 20 days of work \n \n![image](ipfs://QmZ2SEzFxatbHaYfuktsGkAvYk6H6w7RPXpqeNyFmp9tBS)\n\n\n\n![image](ipfs://QmdNSQ7n9ah6F3VBj8trw2ZJtS4isTkQYomfXZyBD7mZrQ)\n\n\n\n\n\nTurf Whitepaper graphic design and UI: (Main Spec - Pixel Art)\nAfter our Turf NFT appearance is settled, we have to create a cool whitepaper to attract new people into the dope community.

      "title": "DIP 41: Dope Wars Initial Quests",
      "content": "This proposal is to onboard hir0 to work as a Quest designer/writer for our Dope City Metaverse.\n\nSponsors: HPMNK, Larko, Pm\n\nMessage from hir0:\nHey everyone! Love the project and looking forward to working on it. A little about me:\nCopywriter for 20 years.\nWorked on crypto content/communications since 2014, full-time since 2017.\nBeen involved with lots of crypto initiatives, starting with Nxt, more recently a content/comms role in a top-tier DeFi project.\nLoved playing text adventure games as a kid (Hitchhikers Guide-style stuff) and later early point-and-click games like Space Quest, then the first release of GTA.\nWorked on writing a few games for fun, especially back when it was easy to create your own text adventure games with relatively little coding experience.\nLove the idea of taking a creative role and helping build the metaverse. I’ve a feeling it’s going to catch on :)\n\n\nSummary for Quests proposal by hir0: \nWrite up 10 initial ‘alpha’ Quests, introducing the player to major characters, areas, principles, and culture of Dope Wars. These will involve finding your way around key locations in Dope City. There should be no on-blockchain activity (no PAPER, NFT, or CRED rewards), but the framework should pave the way for these to be used in the beta release and beyond.\n\nContent:\nAll of the seven Quests sketched in the original quests gdoc, written up in full. Some will be single-part quests, others will have multiple sections. Ideas from the community should ideally be incorporated. Additionally, work on some of the characters and ideas from preliminary work done by hir0.\n\nSub/quests:\nWelcome to Dope City (1 section)\nThe Last Hustler (1 section)\nSoundwave Sammy (3 sections)\nThe Word Reporter (5 sections; drop blockchain/security content and combine with Q5)\nGet Geared Up (4 sections, hir0 suggestion)\nRespect (2 sections, hir0 suggestion)\nDetective Harry Trent (3 sections)\nLenny “The Bets” Baxter (3 sections)\nThe Clue/Oracle Jones (5 sections)\nThe Dope Wars Hustler (1 section)\n\n(Some sections may be condensed/built out when writing so the final number of sub-quests could change a little.)\n\nRATE\nSection counts are provisional (initial estimate ~29). Length of quests will differ. The sample quest I wrote (which would become Q1, The ID Card) was a little under 300 words, which works out at close enough to $69 for a rate of $250 per 1,000 words (my lower-end commercial rate). At 29 quest-sections this would total $2,000, which I suggest we establish as an upper fee for this block of work (unless work turns out to be way more extensive than anticipated, though no fault of mine). \n\n\nQuests are to be reviewed by the sponsors once they are completed. Sponsors are able to request any changes during this review period. Once the quests are accepted as final, an invoice will be given to the DAO in the Dev Fund channel. The PAPER value for the reimbursement will be calculated at the time of invoicing for the next on-chain Tally vote for distribution.\n\nAny additions or subtractions from the plan above will be calculated at the same rate.\n",

I believe, however, in maximizing the limited deployments we have of those methods. Currently our community needs a lot of work and our games are under development and so we should keep our powder dry regarding allocating significant resources on advertising and growth initiatives until we’ve addressed the foundational issues outlined in this document.*\n\n### **Improve Onboarding**\n\n**KPI: Drive to 1,000 unique owners by Q3**\n\nA major barrier to conversion and retention for us right now is it’s difficult for new people to understand what Dope Wars is, what the tokens are, where we are in our overall roadmap, and how to mint Hustlers. A significant focus of April will be to implement much more informative and robust onboarding mechanisms that make it much easier for people to join the fun. This is a multi-faceted challenge that Community and Product will work closely together to fully define and solve, and it is critical we do.\n\n### **Improve Communication & Grow Membership**\n\nThe three places most of our members spend their time are Discord, Telegram, and Twitter. Each of these platforms needs a dedicated, compensated manager who is responsible for representing the DAO’s presence on those platforms in engaging ways. On Twitter in particular, we want to recruit a world-class shit-poster to run our official account and build a following.\n\n**KPI: Establish a rough NPS across channels and grow channel size at least 10% MoM**\n\nOnce all of the above are implemented and reliable, it will be time to turn our attention toward growing our community membership, especially Hustler, Dope and Paper holders.\n\nWe’re going to double-down on our virtual, synchronous hangouts like weekly Discord VCs and Twitter Spaces. These have been great ways for the community to connect and I think we should focus energy on growing the number of attendees.\n\nReal-life meetups are an area we haven’t explored much and one I think with tremendous potential. There are two ways we are well positioned to do IRL events: local member-organized meetups and around the various web3 conferences that happen throughout the year.\n\nWe have large web3 conferences in June and July, NFT NYC and ETHCC Paris. Both represent some of the largest gatherings of people in web3 on their respective continents and Dope Wars should have an official presence at both. It’s a great opportunity to onboard new members through Hustler minting activations as well as distribute merch, connect existing members, film, and more.\n\nWe will do a geo-survey of our membership and begin organizing meetups in clustered areas so Dope Wars members have opportunities to connect in real life. One of the most rewarding parts of being a member of a community is getting together in real life and in Q2 we will begin exploring our ability to host happy hours, brunches, live events, and more.\n\nETH Denver was a great place for our team to connect with one another and for Dope Wars to connect with other teams like Quixotic, distribute merch, and introduce people to our project. I think we should triple-down on having a presence at these types of gatherings and use them as opportunities to bring new people into the murderverse.\n\n### **Improve Compensation**\n\n**KPI: Work with other groups to create contests, bounties, and other reward mechanisms to compensate a broader range of contributors with CRED and Paper.**\n\nThe best version of Dope Wars DAO will incentivize and reward contributors at all levels of commitment from a light retweet here and there to working as a full-time contributor. A major focus of community management in Q2 will be to find ways to engage and activate many more members for lighter contributions and to make that process fun and rewarding. Expect to see the launch of CRED, Contests, Bounties, as well as Ranks and Rewards. There is a lot the DAO can do to compensate members for their work and attention; Community and Admin will collaborate to launch several initiatives.\n\n### **Grow Non-Game Revenue**\n\n**KPI: R&D non-game revenue lines**\n\nWe don’t expect to ship a flagship game in Q2 which limits our ability to generate gaming revenue. There are, however, unlimited opportunities to create revenue for the DAO through non-game means like paid merchandising and IRL experiences.\n\nMerch is an area where there is currently a lot of unmet demand. We don’t have a baseline for what to expect here but this is an opportunity for Community, Product, and members to all get involved and come up with some really creative offerings. Merch stands to be a great source of revenue, culture, and marketing for Dope Wars and it should be a major community focus of Q2.\n\nLive musical events are likely less obvious, but very much on brand for Dope Wars. Hip-hop is a major pillar of our community and we have members with extraordinary experience and connections in the music and events industries. We should explore ways to bring media products and experiences to market.\n\nThe goal in Q2 is to experiment with different forms of revenue generation to see what works. In Q3 and beyond we’ll double down on what makes money and begin driving toward breaking-even on at least Community costs. While not yet having a revenue goal, I do believe we will see substantial incomes in Q2 as a result of this experimentation.\n\n### **Measure Results**\n\nImplementing reliable ways to measure our community health and growth will be completely necessary to the long-term value of Dope Wars. At present we haven’t defined our community KPIs and are not tracking them in a sophisticated way. A focus in April will be to better quantify our community and by the end of June we should be showing measured improvement in our core concerns.\n\n### **Community Management Roles**\n\n- Head of Community\n\n- Social Media Shit-poster\n\n- Telegram Ambassador\n\n- Discord Manager\n\n- Chinese Community Manager\n\n- Spanish Community Manager\n\n- Social Media Content Bounties\n\n\n<!-- -->\n\n### **Budget**\n\n9 ETH - 3 ETH / month\n\n### **Multi-sig**\n\nCyberbitz, RR, mboyle\n\n",

      "title": "DIP 38 - Working Groups and Creative Director",
      "content": "This proposal seeks to establish more formalized working groups around the DAOs core functions. Dope Wars is currently operating without any kind of organization beyond named collaborative discord channels which makes it more difficult to move quickly, have accountability, make decisions, delegate work, stay aligned, and more. The solution is to form working groups with their own multi-sig treasuries and appoint individuals to have accountability for specific work streams.\n\nInitially I recommend the formation of three working groups: Product, Community, and Admin. I also recommend we create the position of and appoint a Creative Director who can be responsible for vision, has final say over creative decisions, and can speak on behalf of the DAO to third parties like investors and press.\n\nProcess and Features\n\n* Every quarter each working group will submit a budget proposal as well as their quarterly goals and plans and results from the previous quarter. The DAO will vote on whether to fund or modify each budget.\n* Each working group will get its own multi-sig wallet managed by the group and funded by DAO-wide proposals\n* We’ll utilize DAO tools like Utopia to facilitate and track compensation across the board\n* The DAO will provide each working group with tools its own private space to focus, collaborate, and ship stuff\n* Leaders of working groups will be responsible for communicating to the wider DAO what’s going on in weekly chats\n\n——\n\nHeavily inspired by Orca Protocol: https://orca.mirror.xyz/Y2xvPmB4cJH51srGqY6Mm_g38lV-7cwvtyDePnyzfAE",

      "title": "DIP - 36  Ensure Capitalization of DAO While Aligning Incentives to Holders ",
      "content": "Why?\n\nDAO needs more PAPER (without minting more PAPER!!)\nDAO needs more revenue (devs need to be paid!!)\nPAPER and DOPE holders need more incentives\n\nHow?\n\n\nIMPLEMENTATION OF DOPE WARS TURF\n\nA player owned in-game area known as Dope Wars TURF. \n\nTURF in its original form is outlined in more detail in Winston’s previous proposal found at the following address: Dope Wars Territories Proposal.\n \nWhat are the changes? \n\nTURF was originally proposed as a free drop of ~30K+ TURF, broken up versions of the real world locations, as a way to bootstrap a “GTA of the Metaverse” environment.  \n\nSince then, a LOT of things have changed, mainly, HMPK and Larko have started building out the maps for the actual game.  As such, it now makes more sense for TURF to be ownership of some of the spaces within these maps, which can function as both ownership of the Dope Wars Metaverse while also having utility within the eventual game states that take place within these maps.\n\nhttps://dope-monorepo-n0wjfcp45-dopewarsexe.vercel.app/game\n\nThe above is an example of one of the “zones”.  In line with the properties of the original Dope Wars NFTs, there are 19 locations or zones.  These have been remapped as per the below.\n\nconst RYO_LOCATIONS = {\n  'The Bayou': ['Upriver', 'Highground', 'Platoon', 'Old Bridge'],\n  Atlanta: ['Oakland City', 'West End', 'Grove Park', 'Adamsville'],\n  Compton: ['Long Beach', 'Inglewood', 'Hollywood', 'Venice'],\n  Oakland: ['Eastmont', 'Webster', 'Claremont', 'Piedmont'],\n  SOMA: ['South Branch', 'Yerba Buena', 'Rincon Hill', 'Central'],\n  'Hong Kong': ['Kowloon City', 'Wan Chai', 'Lan Kwai Fong', 'Chunking Mansions'],\n  London: ['East End', 'Camden Town', 'Brixton', 'Elephant & Castle'],\n  Chicago: ['Englewood', 'West Garfield Park', 'Lincoln Park', 'Beverly'],\n  Brooklyn: ['Brownsville', 'Bushwick', 'Fort Greene', 'Brooklyn Heights'],\n  Detroit: ['Van Steuban', 'Warrendale', 'Fiskorn', 'Palmer Woods'],\n  'Mob Town': ['Grove Park', 'Riverside', 'Canton', 'Berea'],\n  Murdertown: ['Pike Creek', 'Highland', 'Downtown', 'Wooster'],\n  'Sin City': ['The Strip', 'Downtown', 'North Vegas', 'Green Valley'],\n  'Big Smoke': ['Old Bridge', 'Dock Lands', 'Central', 'High Rise'],\n  'The Backwoods': ['Old Town', 'Deep North', 'Hillside', 'West Rim'],\n  'The Big Easy': ['Central City', 'Saint Roch', 'Audoubon', 'Uptown'],\n  Queens: ['Long Island City', 'Ridgewood', 'Rochdale', 'Howard Beach'],\n  BedStuy: ['Bedford', 'Stuyvesant Heights', 'Ocean Hill', 'Central'],\n  Buffalo: ['Parkside', 'North Park', 'Kenfield', 'Emerson'],\n};\n\nAs such, TURF distribution would be as follows\n\n7980 total TURF\n19 zones\n420 locations\n105 per neighborhood\n\n3990 of these TURF would be directly sold as part of the Dope Wars TURF Genesis Land Sale.\n\nProposed price is 0.08ETH.\n\n3990 x 0.08 = 319.2 ETH for the DAO, approx $800K in revenue for the DAO, half of which would be immediately sold for USDC and the other half used to buy back PAPER from the market to increase the DAO’s PAPER holdings.  This would increase the PAPER holdings in the DAO by approx 42m PAPER at current market price.\n\n3990 TURF would be distributed to DOPE holders and PAPER LP stakers.\n\nProposed distribution mechanics - \n\nDOPE holders will be snapshotted.  Maximum 1 TURF per wallet.  A maximum of 1995 TURF to be distributed to this tranche.  Any non distributed TURF from this tranche will be distributed to PAPER stakers.\n\nPAPER will be required to be added to the PAPER/ETH LP on Uni v3 during a “PAPER staking event”.  A minimum amount of PAPER will need to be staked to qualify for the snapshot. 1995 TURF / qualified addresses (to a minimum of 1 TURF with a maximum TBA).\n\nSnapshotted/qualified wallets will be added to the TURF mint contract and have the ability to mint TURF for no cost (sans gas) prior to the Dope Wars TURF Genesis Land Sale.\n\nThere will be 4 types of TURF, small apartment, medium apartment, large apartment and penthouse apartment (names can be modified to fit Dope Wars lore). Distribution of TURF types will be randomized on mint.\n\nDope Wars TURF will be a L1 ETH asset, and thus tradable on Opensea. This will bring in further royalty payments to the DAO based on secondary market trading and a 5% creator royalty fee.\n\nThis structure is heavily influenced by Web3 and their zones and apartments metrics/mechanics.\n\nPAPER BUYBACKS\n\nAs mentioned above, half the revenue from the TURF sale will be used for a one time buy back of PAPER from the market to increase the DAO’s PAPER holdings.   \n\nAdditional buybacks of PAPER by the DAO can be voted on via DAO participants using royalty payments that come in from TURF. An ideal buyback mechanic is that each time a royalty payment is made on TURF via Opensea, 50% of the royalty payment is liquidated from ETH to USDC and 50% is used to buyback PAPER from the market.\n\nREMOVING ABILITY TO INFLATE THE SUPPLY OF PAPER\n\nWith the above buyback mechanics in mind, the supply of PAPER shall not be inflated via additional mints and this proposal seeks to remove the ability of such at the contract level in perpetuity by burning the keys of the PAPER contract.\n\nPAPER is the designated in-game currency of Dope Wars and is used for unbundling DOPE, purchasing accessories, and for LPing to allow prospective players to purchase some for use in the game.\n\nPAYMENT TO CREATORS IN PAPER\n\nIn order to best align incentives with developers, artists, or other contributors to the DAO’s ultimate goals, there shall be a vesting schedule of PAPER yet to be determined by the community. \n\nBUDGET FOR ADDITIONAL FRONT & BACKEND DEVELOPERS\n\nWith the additional revenue generated by TURF, this would allow an increased budget for additional developers to work on this proposal at an hourly market rate with specific deliverables to be codified. \n\nTarrance and Faces can also be paid a standard hourly rate for work carried out on everything Dope Wars so they are no longer working for free.",

      "title": "DIP-27: Street Art Incentive Fund ($Paper Grant Initiative)",
      "content": "# Street Art Incentive Fund ($Paper Grant Initiative)\n\nTaniela.Taki proposes that we designate allotments of $Paper to act as payment to fund TEN projects of DOPEWARS Street Art put up by recognised and respected Graffiti Artists worldwide.\n\nThe individual allotments would comprise of 20,000 $Paper, or a quantity that represents a maximum value of $750 USD or minimum value of $300 USD should the value of $Paper change.\n\nI propose that we create a DW Street Art folder/thread called DOPE WALLS on the discord. A place that potential artists could be directed to where they could display art and apply for an abovementioned allotment in exchange for creating DW Street Art for use by the DOPEWARS DAO. Said application would have to include examples of previous work, or some proof of capability, alongside a brief by the artist of the intended work, method, location and other information as considered relevant by DOPEWARS DAO. The artists intent would be then moderated by appropriate DOPEWAR DAO members and the artist would be given the ‘Green Light’. The moderation process would need to include appropriate investigation to ensure that DOPEWARS DAO was not funding or promoting any un-permitted or undesirable activities.\n\nUpon completion of the work the artist would be required to provide photography (ideally video as well if possible) of the Street Art which would be again moderated by DOPEWARS DAO. I suggest that the quality of work be reasonably measured against an existing piece of street art created for DOPEWARS DAO. I recommend the Barcelona piece as a suitable option. The proposed art would not need to be directly comparable to the Barcelona piece. The artist would need to be given artistic creative control. The produced work would be required to be, as reasonably judged by DOPEWARS DAO moderators, of equivalent quality. Once it is established to be at the required standard funds can released to the artist.\n\nThe artist would need to be informed that the produced digital promotion would be the property of DOPEWARS DAO to utilise as it deems suitable. The artist would be advised that the background information including, but not limited to, method, location, (other information as considered relevant) would be available for use by DOPEWARS DAO to create the promotion. The artist would be entitled to include some information in the promotion that relates to their own profile. (For example if they wanted to include a link to their Instagram profile). This would be a part of the negotiation when getting the ‘Green Light’ to go ahead with the Street Art. The DOPEWARS DAO would retain the right to refuse to publish any information it deems unsuitable.\n\nThe proposed fund should be targeted to create 10 geographically separate locations whereby the Street Art Promotions are created. Ideally these would be in different countries but exceptions may be made for larger countries if that is in the benefit of DOPEWARS DAO. The intent would be to create a global current or Street Art movement for DOPEWARS DAO to promote. The roll out of this incentive fund and production of street art promotions would not necessarily need to be done all in one hit. The project could proceed at a pace agreeable to the DOPEWARS DAO in a way that could match our present drive for organic and creative growth.\n\nThe main effort would be the creation of the TEN physical and electronic promotions for use by the DOPEWARS DAO but there would be secondary benefits to the proposal. By paying the artists in $Paper and engaging with them on the discord we would be likely to on-board people who are both interested and valuable to DOPEWARS DAO. People who would have a network of people who are likely to be interested in the DOPEWARS movement. If enough exposure and momentum is created, secondary proposals could be initiated including extra allotments if desired or the option of an open competition with prize money awarded to winners.\n\n## Proposed cost\n\n200,000 $Paper at current value 0.017 USD: $3,400 USD\n\n**Minimum cost**\n$3000.00 USD\n\n**Maximum cost**\n$7,500.00 USD\n\n**Labour cost**\n\nSet up of Discord folders.\n\nModeration of activity by DAO Members\n\nIdentification and recruitment of suitable talent.\n\nThe possibility of some sort of advertisement of the $Paper Grant Initiative could be considered if required.\n\n## Design for battle\n\nThis proposal would be aimed more as an onboarding/collaboration type activity rather than a simple commissioning process. We attract/identify/recruit suitable talent then engage with them. Hopefully we can show them the promise DW has and they can become involved in the project. This is why the proposal favours payment in $Paper because it represents an investment, of sorts, by the artist into DW's. The remuneration to the artist (20k $Paper) represents a lower value but one that has great potential for growth.\n\nThe engagement marries up with DW's DAO current organic/involved growth model with the potential to onboard people who may have value and access to networks of like-minded people. It also ticks the traditional marketing avenues by creating the digital visual promotions for use by the DAO. (All at a very reasonable cost).",

      "title": "DIP-24: The Hustle Part 1",
      "content": "# Summary\n\n**Dope Wars: The Hustle Begins** is a next step in the evolving Dope Wars ecosystem. **The Hustle** is a coordination game that expands the roles of hustlers, dope, and paper and ultimately introduces a few new primitive: STREETCRED. This proposal seeks to finalize the distribution of STREETCRED.\n\n# Motivation\n\n- Create a non-transferrable reputation token which can be used to reward long term participation and contribution to the Dope Wars ecosystem.\n- Align the incentives of different participants in the ecosystem, creating a token that aligns interests of DOPE, PAPER, and HUSTLER holders.\n- Create a reputation based governance system on Layer 2 (Optimism) to manage DAO assets (PAPER, ETH, and smart contracts).\n\n## STREETCRED\n\nSTREETCRED is non-transferable, reputation token. It is an attribute of a Dope Wars player representing their contributions to the ecosystem. STREETCRED will have an initial allocation as described in this proposal but can be minted/burned by the DAO in order to continually incentivizing active contribution in the ecosystem.\n\n## Distribution\n\nThe initial phase of The Hustle is distribution. During this period hustlers can farm STREETCRED by participating in the Dope Wars ecosystem. The goal is to engage Dope Wars players and reward them for their contributions. Creating an onchain reputation system that is representative of a player’s contributions.\n\nThere will initially be four ways to **earn** STREETCRED:\n\n### Locking DOPE\n\nUsers can lock unbundled DOPE tokens in exchange for STREETCRED. Locking will be done on Ethereum and STREETCRED will be issued to the corresponding account on Optimism. The amount of STREETCRED issued will be proportional to the amount of time the token has been locked. Tokens can be unstaked and the allocated STREETCRED will be wiped.\n\n### Paper LP\n\nIncentivizing PAPER LP is a frequently requested by the community. Increasing PAPER liquidity could provides a way for people to enter/exist the ecosystem without causing a lot of slippage. **Incentivizing PAPER LP should be done when the community thinks the token is priced fairly, otherwise it will increase resistance at the current level.** When the incentive system is activated by the DAO, LP position holders on both mainnet and optimsim will be able to stake their position and receive a STREETCRED allocation as a reward.\n\n### Paper Staking\n\nStaking PAPER with a vesting schedule is a way to show conviction in the long term success of Dope Wars. Staking PAPER will emit STREETCRED proportional to the amount of time it has been locked, increasing over time.\n\n### Contributing\n\nContributing to the DAO and earning STREETCRED. One of the core functions of STREETCRED will be to actively reward ecosystem contributors. It is important that the DAO has a mechanism to reward contributors and enable active participation by those who might not have enough financial capital to take a large position.\n\nIn the future, other ways for players to gain STREETCRED will be designed.\n\n## Allocation\n\nPools below define an initial allocated which could be adjusted by the DAO. The amount of tokens distributed will depend on the number of players participating in each pool.\n\nUnbundled DOPE: 300m\n\nEthereum PAPER/ETH V3 LP: 100m\n\nOptimism PAPER/ETH V3 LP: 100m\n\nStake PAPER: 50m\n\nExisting Contributors Allocation [2]: 122.5m\n\n### [1] **Implications of Locking DOPE**\n\nOne goal of The Hustle will be transitioning the DAO to [a reputation based governance system](https://future.a16z.com/reputation-based-systems/) on Layer 2. **DOPE** tokens will all become unbundled, claimed and locked. The governance token will ultimately transition from **DOPE** to **STREETCRED.** Locking a DOPE token will delegate the DOPE tokens voting power to a contract that will be controlled by the Layer 2 DAO.\n\n### [2] Existing Contributors Allocation\n\n10m: Faces, Mrfax, Tarrence\n\n5m: Shecky, Larko, HPMNK, Perama, Clicksave, Beatws9, MBoyle, Cyberbitz, M1, Winston Wolfe, Dennison\n\n2.5m: Connor, Penguino, Taniela, RR, Bikemaker, Broody, JC Denton, Pajke, Smakosh, Sausage, Romok, TimeTravelerBowie, rach, IzBel",

      "content": "## SPONSORS\n\n@Faces Of ETH + Penguin Wizard + @Mr Fax \n\n## **SUMMARY**\n\nThis proposal seeks to immediately build on [DIP-19](https://www.notion.so/DIP-19-Community-Growth-and-Engagement-Proposal-PART-1-0eeeb4ed0e46442f9d874d155e8aff53) and _allocate 7 ETH + 100k PAPER more_ to the Marketing Wallet budget for two rush projects…\n\n1. Obtaining DOPE NFT gear to build a custom hustler we will auction off during All-Star Weekend in collaboration with Baron Davis cross promoting his History of The Game project. (Between 1.5 - 3.5 ETH)\n2. Minting 10 Zodiac Masks to store and use for future giveaways and contests. (~1eth + 50k PAPER)\n\n## GOALS\n\n(*For the campaign)*\n\nRecruit at least 1,000 new community members to Discord\nGrow Twitter following to 20k.\nGrow TG members to 2500.\nSpread useful information about the Dope Wars Ecosystem using Twitter\n\n## **PROPOSED ALLOCATION**\n\n7 **ETH**  + 100K PAPER\n\n## PROPOSED PLAN 1: Baron Davis Charity Auction\n\nIn collaboration with Baron Davis ([Legendary NBA player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baron_Davis), [1M Twitter followers](https://twitter.com/BaronDavis), [experienced with NFTs](https://medium.com/cryptocomnft/former-nba-all-star-baron-davis-brings-black-santa-to-the-metaverse-cc92c25185c3)) we will obtain DOPE NFT items and gear to construct a 1 of 1 custom Hustler in his likeness, and auction the Hustler off for charity. All proceeds will be donated to [The Last Prisoner Project](https://www.lastprisonerproject.org/) – whose mission is to free all prisoners of the war on cannabis.\n\n- This auction will take place over All Star Weekend, which happens **THIS SUNDAY** Feb 20th. Baron will announce the auction and promote DOPE WARS during the weekend.\n- Baron’s new project *History Of The Game* will provide showcase space in their metaverse for Dope Wars Hustlers\n- We will run banners for History Of The Game on our site, and on DOPE TV.\n- All proceeds will be donated to The Last Prisoner Project; to do some good in the world and firmly establish our stance that Dope Wars is seeking to break down cultural stigmas that have harmed communities of color disproportionately during the failed War On Drugs.\n\n**Obtaining DOPE NFTS**\n\nWe have been given the OK to recreate Baron’s likeness, in a basketball jersey from a team he has represented in the past. Because of the way our on-chain artwork system is implemented; we are seeking to obtain either a Basketball Jersey “from Compton” (UCLA), “from Oakland” (Warriors), or “from The Bayou” (Charlotte Hornets) to create custom artwork for this Hustler. We’re also seeking to purchase a Lowrider to pair with this custom Hustler auction. \n\nThere are only a few NFTs for sale that meet this criteria. The lowest combination being ~ 1.5 eth, and the highest somewhere around 3.5 eth. We are not listing the potential acquisition targets here to prevent front-running.\n\n**Auction**\n\nWe will auction a single DOPE NFT on OpenSea, and all the proceeds will go to the Dope DAO, then be donated to The Last Prisoner Project. The Dope NFT, and Hustler will be transferred to the winner’s wallet.\n\n## PROPOSED PLAN 2: Zodiac Mask Mint\n\nTo ensure Dope Wars has enough material for future giveaways, it’s also being proposed that the DAO Marketing wallet mints 10 Zodiac masks for future giveaways during the course of this year.",

During this period of time, HPMNK will have 100% commitment to the project on a full time schedule to complete the initiatives detailed below and deliver the assets. Evaluations will be made during this month once the assets are delivered.\n\nThis does not include the artwork for quests which will be included in a later proposal.\n\nSponsors\n\n@facesOfEth, @tarrence, @beatws9\n\nTimeline\n\nIt's expected that all first-draft versions of deliverables specified below will be complete within 31 days after successful adoption of this proposal.\n\nHPMNK will complete the static assets first, then the animations. A budget for additional animations was included (ATM lights, Traffic lights, prop animations, etc) because further development of the MVP is needed to prior to adding the animations.

      "content": "Sponsors\n\n@facesofeth  @beatws9\n\nSummary\n\nThis proposal is to onboard Clicksave to work as a UX designer for our Swap Meet 2.0 designs and other initiatives going forward.\n\nBackground\n\nDopeWars is continuously looking to expand our development team. Clicksave has been  responsible for a majority of the current Swap Meet redesign and is working diligently on Swap Meet 2.0 designs. \n\nhttps://dope-wars.notion.site/DIP-28-Onboard-UX-Designer-Clicksave-cfbdcc4af3d341ecad9c96f99fbf8fad\n\nFrom @clicksave:\n\nHey I'm Clicksave, I discovered Dope Wars on launch day and have since become very passionate about the project. It captures the nostalgia I have for the early web and for the past few weeks I've been channeling that inspiration into mockups for various dopeDAO initiatives, most notably elements of the swap meet 2.0 redesign. \n\nHere are some of the specific design solutions I’ve worked on. \n\n- A card view that can be applied consistently to all assets in the dope ecosystem\n- A new tabbed interface for the marketplace\n- Global search\n- A separate inventory view where you can view all your items in one place\n- Mobile friendly iterations of each page\n\n- An activity feed to show transaction history\n- A design scheme to handle special events\n\nDAOs as a model for coordination are wildly exciting to me, they feel very ahead of the curve and intuitive. Participating here, in this manner, has been one of the more enjoyable experiences i've had as a designer.  I’m motivated to help this project in the best way I know how and with your blessing I'd love to keep it going and formalize these contributions through a snapshot proposal.\n\nRate: 1 ETH for the backdated work, $42 / hr for billable time going forward paid in ETH at the end of each month",

      "content": "### **Summary**\n\nThis proposal concerns the production of a season of a Dope Podcast. Something on the order of 12 episodes would be produced which, through one-on-one core contributor interviews, tell the origin story of our community. I’d like to focus on DOPE, the DAO, how we got to today, and where we might go in the future.\n\nListen to a pilot episode here: https://community.dopewars.gg/dope-wars/items/4-episode-1-origins-with-dennison-bertram\n\n### **Background**\n\nWith so many amazing Dope projects nearing delivery, timing is great to begin working on storytelling. Podcasts are one of the best formats we have to tell stories and the genesis of this community is one of web3’s best, and most slept on, stories.\n\n### **Deliverables**\n\n- A 12-episode season of a Dope Podcast\n- Each episode is an interview with core contributors to the project, including Dennison, Tarrence, Faces, Shecky, MrFax with TBD slots for major releases / announcements / community suggestions\n- Reports on statistics on podcast performance and any ad performance\n- Weekly episodes for 3 months, depending on the number of interested interviewees\n\n### **Goals**\n\n- Create and promote an audible history of the origins of this project and community\n- Leverage in-app podcast networks to advertise this season\n- Introduce thousands of new people to Dope Wars\n- Assess whether an ongoing podcast is a worthwhile enterprise\n\n### **About Me**\n\nI’m Michael Boyle, @mboyle in Discord and on Twitter. I’ve been with this project from the jump, contributed to the original Dope NFT contract, and have been paying attention daily as the community has evolved. It’s been thrilling to witness. I’m an entrepreneur with deep background in technology, products, and communities. A few years ago I produced a casual podcast with a business partner you can find *here*.\n\nMy multidisciplinary background, hands-on experience of building in web3 here and in other DAOs, and vantage point of having participated since Dennison’s original tweet make me a great candidate to interview core contributors and help them tell the extraordinary story of what’s going on here.\n\n### **Total proposed cost**\n\n3.5 ETH, with a followup proposal for a marketing budget to advertise the podcast in Overcast, Google Podcasts, etc.",

      "content": "# **Sponsors**\n\n@tarrence\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal is to hire **Larko** to work full-time on the Dope Wars MMORPG game.\n\n# Background\n\nLarko joined the discord a few days ago and started contributing to the game development discussion. He put together [a prototype game](https://dope-monorepo-3vk59pg5i-dopewarsexe.vercel.app/game) using the Phaser game engine as a demonstration. The Phaser game engine supports the sorts of interactions we are interested in developing with a particularly good story around development since it is Typescript based and easily for the rest of the team to contribute.\n\nFrom Larko:\n\n> I wasnt always into game dev but instead got in when I started going into more low level stuff. When I started learning about compilers, cpu, gpu, memory and low level languages like c/c++ and assembly, and that is why I write most of my games and project in low level languages and by directly interacting with the graphics API. I'm more of a \"from scratch\" guy than someone who will just be using an engine like unity and that won't care about the intrinsics. Most of the games I made were in C/C++ and using OpenGL, ranging from 2d simple games, 2.5d (world in 2d but graphics in ~3d) to 3d. For eg. some of the projects I made include a raycaster, in the style of the wolfenstein one back in the day, simulators (gsim for eg.) and a voxel minecraft clone (which is nice because tile based games are pretty similar to voxel games in way, we just deal with squares instead of cubes, and in tile based games, we obviously dont need to care about the complex culling stuff). Something also great about the fact that I learned game dev using opengl is that I obviously know shaders and how the pipeline works so we can do pretty neat stuff with webgl by using GLSL shaders. In this case we will be using phaser so we can embed glsl if the context supports webgl. Outside of \"concrete game dev\", I also have a background in game modding, I learned a ton of things thanks to it and by reverse engineering games, I learned some code and game dev architecture best practices (or bad, we dont know). I also have been dealing with networking and know how to use some of the available technologies. As for the front end and software engineering side of things, I'm not that rusty and have some good knowledge of the latest technologies out here. I use typescript and THREE.js for my prototyping and have already written code with next and react js.\n> \n\n**github**: [https://github.com/Larkooo](https://github.com/Larkooo)\n\n**Rate**: $69.420 / hr. paid in eth at the end of each month\n\n**Commitment:** 40hr / week until end jan, 20hr / week after",

The experience will integrate the Swap Meet marketplace functions that are currently found in [DopeWars.gg](http://dopewars.gg/) into an interactive game world.\n\nCreation of a tileset map for Dope Wars and achieving implementation targets will also allow for streamlined integration with [other metaverse projects such as Webb3](https://worldwideweb3.com/).\n\n### Sponsors\n\n@facesOfEth, @bellgloom, @beatws9\n\n**Outdoor Map**\n\n![Example Map](https://i.ibb.co/C62bKWC/dope-map.png)\n\nThe tileset map will feature a number of interactive options for players, but will be limited to a realistic scope for a target release date.  \n\n- Storefronts will be available for players to enter. Separate proposals will fund the development of interiors which will feature single-scene illustrations with shopkeeper purchasing and dialogue options.\n- The Subway will take players to a zoomed-out $TURF map of a larger game world. This map will show other 'city block' locations available for travel, implementation and development planned through a separate proposal.\n- The payphone will be the game world object that interfaces with the StarkNet Dope Wars drug arbitrage game, allowing players to play the MVP version of this feature. This will be experienced through a pop-up, single screen interface when interacting with the payphone, similar to the storefront interiors.\n- An in-game ATM will link the player to a Uniswap UX for trading PAPER.\n- Four color palettes for buildings and objects — dawn, day, dusk, and night.\n- Buildings will feature two states indicating whether they're open or closed. For example, roll-down gates, closed signs, or barred/boarded up windows.\n\nSpecifics for additional storefront options and features will be decided on through the MVP development process, and will be clearly communicated with the community.\n\n---\n\n![Mind Map](https://i.ibb.co/NyRmNCr/map-rate-table.png)\n\n---\n\n## Deliverables of this Proposal\n\n**Buildings**\n\n1. Shoe Store\n2. Sporting Goods Store\n3. Car Dealership\n4. Police Station\n5. Pawn Shop\n6. Armory\n7. Clothing Store\n8. Record Store\n9. Bar\n10. Generic\n11. Generic, Large\n12. Under Construction\n\n**Objects**\n\n1. Payphone\n2. ATM\n3. News Stand\n4. Box office\n5. Vending Machine\n6. Subway Entrance\n7. Bus Bench\n8. Trees\n9. Bushes\n10. Street lights\n11. Telephone poles + wires\n12. Trash cans\n13. Litter\n14. Chainlink fences\n15. Street barricades\n\n---\n\n## Deliverable Technical Specifications\n\n- 32x32 pixel tiles\n- 1x pixel resolution (smallest possible, no scaling)\n- Sprite sheets will be delivered that can be used in Aseprite, Tiled, Unity Map Editor, etc\n\n---\n\n## Payment Structure & Terms\n\nFrom our [dev fund established in DIP-9](https://www.notion.so/DIP-9-Development-Fund-fc152bb94eee401a878d340b1a61b219), good-faith payment in ETH equivalent to 500USDC will be sent to `HPMNK` to kick off this project for successfully delivering a test map within hours of first contact.\n\nOngoing, payment will be rendered weekly in ETH, based on the number of objects delivered. The Sponsors of this proposal are allowed to request up to 3 changes per deliverable before accepting it as complete.\n\n`HPMNK` and Sponsors must submit weekly invoice in Discord to the #dev-fund channel before payment is rendered.\n\n**Rate Table**\n\n| Building | ETH ~= 450 USDC |\n| --- | --- |\n| Object | ETH ~= 225 USDC |\n| Tileset | ETH ~= 450 USDC |\n\n### 3 ETH Max Budget\n\n![Rate Table](https://i.ibb.co/NyRmNCr/map-rate-table.png)\n\n---\n\n## Timeline\n\nIt's expected that all first-draft versions of Deliverables specified above will be complete within 14-21 days after successful adoption of this proposal.",

      "content": "# **Sponsors**\n\n@tarrence @facesofeth\n\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish a development fund managed by a multisig for the purpose of engaging with external development resources and reimbursing costs (tools, hosting, etc). Additionally, included in the proposal is a DAO first hire.\n\n# Background\n\nWe would like to increase development velocity by increasing DAO spend on development. Currently, there is a lot of overhead in allocating DAO resources for development. In order to disburse funds, an onchain proposal and vote is necessary, which is both expensive and slow.\n\n# Proposal\n\nThis initial proposal is for a **5eth** allocation to fund these activities for 2 months to pilot the arrangement, to be renewed through a future vote if desired. The funds will be managed by a 2-of-5 multisig previously used for treasury management before the migration to onchain governance (configuration detailed below). \n\nThe initial allocation will be exclusively used to fund development efforts. This includes reimbursement for development + productivity tooling costs such as vercel, github, notion, fauna, etc. Disbursement approvals will be done according to the following:\n\n**0-$500**: Only multisig approval necessary\n\n**$500+ & New Hires**: Three day snapshot vote approval necessary\n\n### Multisig Configuration:\n\n**Address**: [https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xB429Bee46B7DF01D759D04D57DaBe814ECf0341b](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/#/safes/0xB429Bee46B7DF01D759D04D57DaBe814ECf0341b)\n\n**Members**:\n\n**@Penguin Wizard**\n**@facesof.eth**\n**@dennisonbertram**\n**@raf**\n**@tarrence**\n\n## Frontend Developer Hire\n\nIncluded in this proposal is a hire: \n\n### **smakosh.eth**\n\n**website**: [smakosh.com](http://smakosh.com/)\n\n**twitter**: [https://twitter.com/smakosh](https://twitter.com/smakosh)\n\n**github**: [https://github.com/smakosh](https://github.com/smakosh)\n\n**Rate**: $69.420 / hr. paid in eth at the end of each month\n\n**Commitment:** 30hr / week\n\n**Logistics:**\n\n- Smakosh to report high level hourly breakdown per week to discord #builders channel\n- Focus and prioritization managed by facesof.eth and tarrence to work on dopewars.gg, as defined in our [roadmap](https://www.notion.so/f6e68234cb3145f3a02ae8d215e9f63f)\n\n**From Smakosh:**\n\n> Front-end engineer (I care a lot about the codebase and I love code refactoring)\nCurrently enjoying TypeScript, React.js via Next.js or CRA\n> \n\n**From Tarrence:**\n\n> Smakosh is a talented developer bringing both strong engineering principles and an eye for design to the team. His experience intersects well with our stack, having worked with typescript/react/vercel/web3 in the past. Bringing Smakosh onboard will help accelerate the development of the [dopewars.gg](http://dopewars.gg) application.\n>",

      "title": "DIP-8: Optimistic Unbundling/Hustler Deployment",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal is to assess community interest in deploying [unbundling + hustlers](https://www.notion.so/Dope-Wars-Ignition-e92fd2b6efeb4e4991c7df98f5553283) to the [optimistic rollup](https://www.optimism.io/) rather than Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nThe goal of deploying to optimism would be to make the project future proof and the process more accessible, reducing gas costs for transactions such as equipping hustlers and transferring items.\n\nCurrently, the plan is deploy hustlers to the Ethereum Mainnet. Due to current gas costs, there is a risk that some participants are priced out and unable to unbundle/exchange/mint their items and hustlers. It will also probably become necessary at some point in the future to migrate nfts to layer 2 as layer 1 becomes congesting with rollup checkpoints.\n\nThe unbundling/hustler minting flow would ideally look something like this:\n\n1) Approve DOPE/PAPER on L1\n\n2) Mint hustler/og from DOPE token, paying PAPER + ETH required on L1\n\n3) Hustler + unbundled items magically appear in your same wallet on Optimism\n\nThe cost of doing this would likely be an order of magnitude less. On L1 we will store a single value in the state to track the unbundled state of a DOPE token. This approach also means it would not be necessary to bridge ETH/PAPER to L2 in order to unbundle.\n\nOnce on the Optimism L2, users can do everything they could on Ethereum L1 for a fraction of the cost. The [dopewars.gg](http://dopewars.gg) application will be updated to make switching chains simple and seamless.\n\nThere are a few downsides to this approach, mainly the immaturity of the NFT marketplace on L2. Many users would like access to a NFT market place like OpenSea to easily buy/sell items and upgrade their hustlers equipment. For now, that does not exist but is planned for after unbundling/hustlers. If DOPE holders are interested in continuing this exploration, we can potentially work with protocols such as Zora to deploy a dopewars native marketplace on Optimism.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Why Optimism over arbitrum/starknet/ect?\n\nThere is some technical nuance as to why Optimism is the best target for our deployment. Namely, their focus on EVM equivalence ([https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/introducing-evm-equivalence-5c2021deb306)) means that optimistic rollups seamlessly integrate into existing ethereum infrastructure. We are currently building the dopewars game execution engine on starknet (https://github.com/dopedao/RYO) and using optimism means that we could use the same approaches we planned to use on L1 (storage proofs) to hydrate game state on starknet. EVM equivalence also means it is much more likely a direct Optimism <> Starknet bridge will exist since there is less overhead in implementing it.\n\nAs far as why not Starknet, it is simply not ready for this sort of use case yet.\n\n### What happens to DOPE/DopeDAO?\n\nFor now, those would remain on mainnet. In the future, we could decide to migrate those too, but it is outside the scope of this proposal.\n\n### Wen?\n\nIf all goes according to plan, we could have something ready for OVM 2.0 launch on November 11.",

      "title": "DIP-7: The Dope Wars Music Initiative",
      "content": "Summary\nThe Dope Wars Music Initiative seeks to create and develop high-quality music assets for the Dope Wars ecosystem, for use in-game and for marketing content. \n\nDeliverables\n1. Create 5 original hip-hop songs with both current and OG artists\n2. Release a Dope Wars EP on streaming, tokenized by Dope Dao\n3. Produce a music video for one song, a major Dope Wars marketing piece\n4. License/acquire instrumental hip-hop beats, at least 20 songs\n5. Create original ChipTune/8-bit music, at least 10 songs\n6. Produce a Dope Wars promotional mixtape with a top hip-hop DJ\n7. Continue to produce DopeTV and other music channels \n\n**Total Proposed Cost: 16 ETH**\n\n**Item 1: The Dope Wars EP • Proposed Cost: 10 ETH**\n\nThe centerpiece of the DWMI is 5 original, new hip-hop songs that will be funded and controlled by the Dope Dao, to be released as ***The Dope Wars EP*** via DSP streaming services like Spotify in Q1 2022, and to be included in game play and for marketing purposes.\n\n**Item 1: Costs and Timelines**\n\nLooking to get this EP produced for 10 ETH. Think of it as 5 songs, 2 ETH per song, 1 ETH for the rapper(s), 1 ETH for the producer\n\nThe Producer’s portion will cover the costs of recording, mixing and mastering the songs. Alchemist is our first choice, but if for some reason that deal is unable to close there are other producers we can call on to anchor the project.\n\n**Item 2: Tokenizing and Releasing the EP**\n\nWhen all the songs are completed The Dope Wars EP will be tokenized, with a portion of the tokens auctioned off to DOPE holders and the public. Tokens/NFTs would ideally give holders a right to a share of streaming royalties earned by the music. The mechanics of the tokenization and auction process are TBD.\n\nIn my view the fairest way to structure tokenization of the music would be:\n\n⅓ reserved for the Dope Dao\n⅓ reserved for the artists\n⅓ auctioned to the public\n\n**Item 2: Treasury Contribution**\n\nAuctioning Dope Wars EP Tokens/NFTs to the public will contribute a corresponding amount of ETH or PAPER to the Dao Treasury.\n\nI propose that 33% of the collected ETH or PAPER from the auction be allocated to me, SheckyGreen, for Executive Producing the DWMI. This would be my only compensation for spearheading this project, and I believe it aligns incentives perfectly.\n\n**Item 3: Producing Music Video • Proposed Cost: 3 ETH**\n\nWhat an incredible marketing tool will this be, an authentic hip-hop video that truly announces our arrival. I propose that Dan Melamid aka Dan The Man take on the job of video director and editor. He’s directed many fantastic rap videos and a lot of other great stuff. Check out his high quality work here: https://danmelamid.com/\n\nAs far as timing, Think 30 days to make the song, 30 days to make the video. Most likely release Q1 2022.\n\n**Item 4: Licensing instrumental hip-hop beats • Proposed Cost: 1 ETH**\n\nI am proposing a budget of 1 ETH to acquire at least 20 hip-hop instrumentals from viable producers, so 0.05 per beat.\n\nWe are lucky to have a number of community members offering to contribute music or collaborate on music for the game. We welcome all these sounds and ideas to the table.\n\n**Item 5: Original ChipTune music • Proposed Cost: 1 ETH**\n\nWe will create 10 original ChipTune/8-bit style beats, probably covers of great hip-hop songs, to be used in the Dope Wars Arcade and elsewhere. Penguin has a great artist who specializes in this style, and he is taking the lead on getting this done. 10 beats at 0.1 ETH each to start—if we need more beats we can allocate additional ETH down the road.\n\n**Item 6: Dope Wars mixtape with a top hip-hop DJ  • Proposed Cost: 1 ETH**\n\nThe job here is: a known hip-hop DJ creates a Dope Wars mixtape in two parts, released for free on the internet. Dope Wars becomes a key sponsor for the DJ’s Twitch streams, for a certain period of time. He supports the project, plays our mixes, plays our own music when it’s ready, maybe some of the ChipTunes, he shouts out the game and drives people to our site.\n\n**Item 7: DopeTV and any other music channels that the project may need**\n\nWe will continue to produce Dope TV, here’s a few ideas for expanding on the platform:\n\n- Adding current hip-hop videos that fit our aesthetic\n- Running our own “TV spots” for Dope Wars in between videos.\n- Eventually selling ad time to other NFT projects, but we’ll need a lot more viewers for that\n- Broadcasting DJs on Twitch and vice versa, “raiding” streams\n\nIf the Dope Wars game or ecosystem requires more music channels—specialty playlists, genre channels like pop or reggae or 80s—my company is able to spin up audio channels quickly. There is no charge for these services, we want to make this revenue additive for the Dao. \n\nOn the strength 👊🏼 as we say.   \n~SheckyGreen\n",

Individual items can be composited to create full character visualizations.\n\nThese assets will enable development of the Dope Wars metaverse by providing developers a set assets with which to build games. The art will be free to use for anyone.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n1) Individual component illustrations for `weapons` (18), `clothes`(20), `waist`(16), `foot`(17), `hand`(14), `necklace`(3), `rings`(7), `drugs`(19).\n\n2) Male and Female character sprites with three skin tones each.\n\n3) System for mapping component illustrations to component names.\n\n4) Export individual components as compositable 64x64 pngs.\n\n# **Fulfillment**\n\n**Fulfiller**\n\n> **@mrfax**\nI am a designer / art director who fell in love with the idea of DopeWars and as soon as I received my loots I started creating my own characters. The community liked it so the idea is to create all the possible characters by making all the elements of the lists and also some faces, different hairstyles, skin color, everything in both genders.\n\n**Deadline**\n\nOctober 1st, 2021\n\n**Rewarded**\n10 ETH",
