      "content": "\r\nProposal to add TOKEN as an capped collateral to Interest Protocol.\r\nIn this example, LINK is the token being listed\r\n\r\n## Compensation Eligibility\r\n\r\n1. Communicate on the IP forum how and why a delegate voted the way they did within seven days of the close of a vote (minimum 90% of the time) in their dedicated delegate thread.\r\n2. Command voting weight greater than or equal to 1 basis point of the total IPT supply.\r\n3. Participate in at least 90% of all on-chain IP votes within the previous 30 days, or have participated in 90% of the on-chain IP votes in the past 180 days.\r\n4.The Recognized Delegate (or one authorized representative if a team or institution) must attend at least one public protocol development call each month, and for each 6 months of attendance each delegate gets 1 month pass never to have more than 2 months worth of longevity compensation passes accumulated.\r\n5. Delegates must include in their delegate threads whether they attended community calls (CCs). The governance facilitator will check off attendance by liking the post.\r\n\r\n## Compensation Clause\r\n\r\n1. If any delegate is or has been conducting business for the protocol or is or has done ‘above and beyond’ work any time in the past year, they will get 1 free month pass they can exercise at any time to get their compensation.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\ni. Longevity and Above and Beyond passes can be used retroactively to restore compensation without a governance vote by simply notifying the governance coordinator of the month the pass would be applied. Above and Beyond passes never expire. Longevity passes also don’t expire but never can be greater than 2.\r\n\r\n## Offboarding\r\n\r\n1. If any delegate is MIA (not just missing eligibility terms) for 3 months (on communication/voting/calls, etc.), any other delegate can propose their removal after posting in forums their desire to remove a delegate.\r\n\r\n2. The removal due to extenuating circumstances can be reversed for up to a year later should the delegate return to the community and make a formal explanation of their absence. They will still lose some compensation months but can exercise any and all month passes (up to 2) and their N month ‘above and beyond’ work passes.",

As the reserve is currently in bridged USDC.e, we propose to allow both USDC versions to exist as reserve assets simultaneously. \r\n\r\nEventually, at a time where no more bridged USDC.e exists in the reserve, a future proposal can depricate this reserve token completely and return to single reserve at that time. \r\n\r\n**This is specifically for the Optimism deployment of Interest Protocol only.**\r\n\r\n## Relevant References\r\n[Migrating to the Native USDC-OP](https://medium.com/paytrie/were-migrating-to-the-native-usdc-op-token-863939857d4#:~:text=What%20will%20happen%20to%20Bridged,exchange%20their%20tokens%20for%20CAD.)  \r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThe [new Implementation for USDI](https://gfx.cafe/ip/contracts/-/blob/velo/contracts/USDI.sol?ref_type=heads) now has a primary and a secondary reserve. These reserves are assumed to have the same amount of decimals, as USDC.e and USDC are both decimal 6. \r\n\r\nThe execution of the proposal will set the primary reserve to [Native USDC](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85) and the secondary to the currently used [Bridged USDC.e](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x7f5c764cbc14f9669b88837ca1490cca17c31607). \r\n\r\nThere are now functions to deposit and withdraw separately for each reserve, which users are free to do at any time in any amount for which there exists liquidity. \r\n\r\nThe total reserve is calculated with the simple addition of these two token balances on the contract.

The process of wrapping the underlying rebase token is abstracted away from the end user. \r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, the underlying rebase token is wrapped for the [Capped Rebase](https://gfx.cafe/ip/contracts/-/blob/master/contracts/lending/wrapper/CappedRebaseToken.sol?ref_type=heads) wrapper token, which is sent to the user's standard vault. The balance of these wrapper tokens in the vault will remain fixed, while still accurately tracking the growing number of underlying rebase tokens owed to the user. When the user returns to withdraw their underlying rebase tokens (or is liquidated), the wrapper tokens will automatically be unwrapped with the expected balance of underlying rebase tokens with interest applied. \r\n\r\nThis wrapper contract logic has been upgraded from the original [WAMPL](https://etherscan.io/token/0xedb171c18ce90b633db442f2a6f72874093b49ef#code) implementation specifically for this application, allowing for all accounting to be done in the base underlying units, rather than the wrapper balance. This is critical as the wrapper balance is not intuitively correlated with the underlying balance.  \r\n\r\nWith this change, the protocol can simply account in the underlying without having to convert from the wrapper balance to the underlying, and we can avoid an upgrade to the vault controller.  \r\n\r\n[Extensive testing](https://gfx.cafe/ip/contracts/-/tree/master/test/cap/cappedRebase?ref_type=heads) has been done to ensure that this implementation works as intended, and that accounting can be safely done in the underlying rebase token's units with regard to token decimals, deposit, withdrawal, and liquidations.

This is because the exchange rate can be easily manipulated, but manipulation can be easily detected if compared to external price oracles. If the two exchange rates do not agree within a tight buffer, then the oracle simply reverts in order to prevent manipulation. More info on the inner workings can be found in the technical writeup below\r\n\r\nThis simulated swap on the pool should have a sufficiently large input amount in order to account for slippage. \r\n\r\nThe existing oracle has a hard coded amount for this input value, which has become too high as liquidity has declined, such that the simulated swap has too great a price impact to be within the expected range. \r\n\r\nThis updated oracle solves this problem, with a new dynamic input amount that will always be 1% of the balance of token 0 in the pool, as token 0 is used as the input token in the simulated swap. \r\n\r\nWith this new oracle, the exchange rate returned is within 0.5% of the what is expected based on the external oracles. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Relevant References\r\n[Technical Writeup](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u4dju8zORKWp3mEoCcEFgDvt90ro0tu17GOOLH2tHxY/edit)\r\n\r\n",

Specifically, liquidations where the collateral being liquidated is a Uniswap V3 Position will be total.  \r\n<u>__There are no partial liquidations__</u>.   \r\nAs such, any liquidation of a loan where more than one position exists in the vault will transfer all positions to the liquidator. As such, the Vault Controller upgrade is needed to set the liability to 0 after liquidation, rather than compute the new liability. \r\n\r\nMore details on the inner workings of this upgrade to be found [below](#detailed-description). \r\n\r\n## Parameters\r\n\r\nPool Address: [0x85149247691df622eaF1a8Bd0CaFd40BC45154a9](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x85149247691df622eaf1a8bd0cafd40bc45154a9)  \r\nWrapper address: [UniV3CollateralToken](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x7131FF92a3604966d7D96CCc9d596F7e9435195c)\r\nLTV: 75%  \r\nLiquidation incentive: 7.5%  \r\nPrimary Valuation Contract: [V3PositionValuator](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x5c69C9551E2fE670eDC82EC0288843c1956eE644)  \r\nUnderlying Asset Oracle: token 0: [wETH](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xcB88cf29121E5380c818A7dd4E8C21d964369dF3) \r\nUnderlying Asset Oracle: token 1: [USDC](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xcEe78cE44e98d16f59C775494Be24E0D2cFF19A4) \r\n\r\n## Liquidity\r\n\r\nPOOL: [wETH/USDC fee: 500](https://info.uniswap.org/#/optimism/pools/0x85149247691df622eaf1a8bd0cafd40bc45154a9)  \r\nTVL: $5.36mm  \r\nLiquidity at current price: ~427 wETH & ~4.27mm USDC\r\nVolatility: Similar to wETH & USDC  \r\n24hr volume (pool): $18.84mm\r\n\r\n## Technical risks\r\n\r\nType of contract: ERC-721 [NonfungiblePositionManager](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xc36442b4a4522e871399cd717abdd847ab11fe88)  \r\nUnderlying asset: USDC/wETH  \r\nTime: Deployed May 4, 2021  \r\nValue: Uniswap V3 Position  \r\nPrivileges: None  \r\nUpgradability: No  \r\n\r\n## Relevant References\r\n[Uniswap V3 Development Book](https://uniswapv3book.com/)  \r\n[MKR DAO GUniLPOracle](https://github.com/makerdao/univ3-lp-oracle/blob/master/src/GUniLPOracle.sol#L248)\r\n\r\n### Implementations\r\n[VaultNft](https://gfx.cafe/ip/contracts/-/blob/master/contracts/lending/vault/VaultNft.sol)  \r\n[NftVaultController](https://gfx.cafe/ip/contracts/-/blob/master/contracts/lending/controller/NftVaultController.sol)  \r\n[V3PositionValuator](https://gfx.cafe/ip/contracts/-/blob/master/contracts/oracle/External/V3PositionValuator.sol)  \r\n[Univ3CollateralToken](https://gfx.cafe/ip/contracts/-/blob/master/contracts/lending/wrapper/Univ3CollateralToken.sol)  \r\n\r\n## Housekeeping\r\n\r\nA previous proposal to list SNX had a step which ran out of gas in the cross chain proposal process. This proposal includes a fix for this, and the gas limit has been increased across the board to prevent this from happening in the future. \r\n\r\n## Detailed Description\r\n\r\nPricing for the positions is determined by a single valuator contract, V3PositionManager. The Position Valuator is an upgradeable proxy which will be owned by Interest Protocol governance. This contract independently calculates the current sqrt price (using external oracles for the two underlying tokens), and then calculates the amounts for the underlying tokens of the position, were they to be withdrawn immediately. Based on these token amounts, we can determine the value of the position\r\n\r\nIn short, a position is represented by a single non-fungible token ([NFT](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)), which contains data describing the position. From this data, the upper and lower bounds of the position (tickUpper/tickLower) as well as the liquidity are used to determine the price. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the token0, token1, and fee from the position are used to calculate the pool address, which is needed in order to confirm registration of the pool, as well as to determine the correct external oracles to use to price the underlying asset of the pool. The Position Valuator keeps track of which pools are registered for use on Interest Protocol.\r\n\r\nPositions are deposited into the new Univ3CollateralToken contract, which wraps the position into a modified ERC-20 type token. Univ3CollateralToken is a new upgradeable proxy contract owned by Interest Protocol governance, and effectively wraps the Uniswap V3 position as an ERC-20 token. \r\n\r\nThis token is then transferred to the standard vault (v1), while the actual position is sent to a new vault type, VaultNft (v3). All current and future pools listed as collateral will be using this same contract deployment, so no additional deployments are needed to list more pools, other than any additional external oracles, though most of these external oracles are likely already in use on IP for currently listed assets. \r\n\r\nThis wrapper on the surface appears to work generally the same way as any standard ERC-20, but underneath there are a number of custom changes.\r\n \r\nThe key difference lies in the balanceOf function of the Univ3CollateralToken. This function requires that the address passed be a standard vault address, and when called returns the actual value (in USDi terms) of the positions held by the VaultNft(v3) with that vault ID. \r\n\r\nPositions are associated with a minter’s wallet address in an array. Multiple positions are allowed, and are stored in a dynamic array, which can be read by calling depositedPositions(address minter). \r\n\r\n<u>__Partial liquidations are not allowed, in the case of liquidation, the liquidator will receive all positions held by the vault.__ </u>  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, if a vault contains any standard or capped assets in addition to any Uniswap V3 Positions, those assets must be completely liquidated __before__ liquidation of the Uniswap position can occur. \r\n\r\n\r\nPartial withdrawals are allowed. For the “amount” argument, pass the index of the position to withdraw with respect to where it is stored in the dynamic array. Mutation of the list is handled such that if a middle index is withdrawn, its index in the array will be replaced with the final index, and the new array’s length will be reduced by 1. \r\n\r\nIf the “amount” argument is greater than the number of positions held by the vault, then all positions will be withdrawn. Liquidations are hard coded to pass the max possible uint256 for the “amount”. \r\n\r\nVaultNft minters can collect fees generated by their positions at any time, these fees are not included in the value of the position. \r\n\r\nThe current implementation does not allow for a cap, so pools should be listed conservatively. Because the price is treated as equivalent to the balance in our wrapper, the total supply is effectively dynamic and moves with the price. Therefore, it is not feasible to cap the total supply of the wrapper as is done with other capped assets. \r\nAs such, there is no mint event when depositing to the wrapper contract, and totalSupply is never changed, and so is always 0.

      "title": "Proposal to add wOETH",
      "content": "\r\nProposal to add Wrapped Origin Ether (wOETH) as a Capped collateral to Interest Protocol.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThe [Origin Ether](\"https://www.oeth.com/\") was launched in May 2023 and is an ERC20 LST aggregator that generates yield while sitting in your wallet. OETH is backed 1:1 by stETH, rETH, frxETH, ETH, and WETH at all times; holders can go in and out of OETH as they please. Yield is paid out daily and automatically (sometimes multiple times per day) though a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held.\r\n\r\n### Wrapped OETH\r\n\r\nIn order for smart contracts to support OETH directly, they would need to be able to send a transaction to opt-in to OETH yield generation. Additionally, the smart contract would then need to be able to handle the rebasing nature of the token. \r\n\r\nThe Capped Token infastructure of Interest Protocol makes this difficult, though probably not impossible. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is much more simple to instead list the wrapped version (wOETH).\r\n\r\nOETH yield is paid out daily and automatically through a positive rebase in the form of additional OETH, proportional to the amount of OETH held. Similar to Frax’s sfrxETH, wOETH is a ERC-4626 vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. When you wrap OETH, you get back a fixed number of wOETH tokens. This number will not go up - you will have the same number of wOETH tokens tomorrow as you have today. However, the number of OETH tokens that you can unwrap will go up over time, as **wOETH earns yield at the same rate as standard OETH**. The wOETH to OETH exchange rate can be read from the contract, or via the [OETH dapp](https://app.oeth.com/wrap  ). More information on wOETH and the wrapping/unwrapping process can be found within the [OETH docs](https://docs.oeth.com/core-concepts/wrapping).\r\n\r\nwOETH contract address: [0xDcEe70654261AF21C44c093C300eD3Bb97b78192](https://etherscan.io/token/0xDcEe70654261AF21C44c093C300eD3Bb97b78192)\r\n\r\nCurrent exchange rate: 1 wOETH = 1.033023 OETH\r\n\r\nOETH yield, currently ~10% APY, comes from a combination of:\r\n\r\nCurve and Convex AMO strategies\r\nLST validator rewards\r\nA 50bip exit fee is charged to those who choose to exit OETH via the dapp (completely avoidable if using a DEX), this fee goes back to OETH holders\r\nOETH sitting in non-upgradable contracts does not rebase, instead the interest generated from those tokens is provided to those that can rebase\r\nThese 4 yield generating functions combined enable OETH to generate higher yields than holding any single LST. As with [OUSD](\"https://forums.interestprotocol.io/t/proposal-to-add-ousd/205\"), OGV is also the governance token for OETH. The current asset allocation and yield strategies can be seen via the [OETH home page](\"https://www.oeth.com/\").\r\n\r\n## Parameters\r\n\r\nToken Address: [0xDcEe70654261AF21C44c093C300eD3Bb97b78192](https://etherscan.io/token/0xDcEe70654261AF21C44c093C300eD3Bb97b78192)\r\nCapped Token address: [0x739D346421a42beb13FD8D560dd2F42250d4Ac88](https://etherscan.io/token/0x739D346421a42beb13FD8D560dd2F42250d4Ac88)\r\nLTV: 50%\r\nLiquidation incentive: 10%\r\nCap: 575(~$1,000,000)\r\nPrimary Oracle Address: [wOETH_ORACLE](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7b518e0C898c0Bcd80e8E5B5E8d7735007012834)\r\n\r\n## Liquidity\r\n\r\nMarket Cap: $22,617,439\r\nLiquidity: $22,617,439\r\nCoingecko 7-day avg 24hr volume: $733,069\r\nNotable exchanges: Uniswap, Curve\r\n\r\n## Technical risks\r\n\r\nType of contract: ERC20\r\nUnderlying asset: stETH, rETH, frxETH, ETH, and WETH\r\nTime: 53 Days Ago (April 18, 2023)\r\n\r\n## Implementation Details\r\n\r\nA new capped token contract implementation is needed for to support this and any future ERC-4626 tokens in the future. \r\n\r\n[Capped ERC4626](https://gfx.cafe/ip/contracts/-/blob/master/contracts/lending/wrapper/CappedERC4626.sol?ref_type=heads)\r\n\r\nThe underlying asset of this cap token contract will be wOETH, **not OETH**\r\n\r\nThis contract works largely the same as existing Capped Tokens, with the following exceptions: \r\n\r\nDeposits can consist of **either** OETH or wOETH. OETH deposits will be wrapped to wOETH on deposit. \r\n\r\n**Withdrawals and Liquidations will unwrap the wOETH back to OETH**  \r\n**There is no option to withdraw or liquidate to wOETH directly**\r\n\r\nAs such, deposits of a particular OETH balance will result in a **smaller** balance of Capped wOETH tokens netted to the vault due to the exchange rate, however the USD value should remain the same.  \r\n\r\nLikewise, withdrawals of Capped wOETH will result in a **larger** balance of OETH received due to the exchange rate, though the USD value should remain the same. \r\n\r\n## Risk Mitigation\r\n\r\nThere are five possible risks when using OETH, and Origin is making sure to reduce each risk as much as possible:\r\n\r\nSmall market cap risk - Given OETH is a relatively new token, some may be worried that OETH is prone to new attack surfaces. While this may be true for other new tokens, OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. Not that long ago, [OUSD reached a market cap of $300m](https://defillama.com/protocol/origin-dollar) without breaking, and without diminishing the APY it was capable of generating. Origin continues to work on OUSD, despite the lower market cap.\r\n\r\nCounterparty risk - OETH is governed by OGV stakeholders around the world. Everything from yield generation to fee collection and distribution is managed by a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts are upgradeable with a timelock and are controlled by hundreds of governance token holders. While the initial contracts and yield-earning strategies were developed by the Origin team, anyone can shape the future of OETH by creating or voting on proposals, submitting new strategies, or contributing code improvements. We intend for all important decisions to be made through community governance and limited powers to be delegated to trusted contributors who are more actively involved in the day-to-day management of the protocol.\r\n\r\nSmart contract risk of the yield strategies - Origin is only using platforms for yield generation that have a proven track record, have been audited, have billions in TVL, maintain a bug bounty program, and provide over-collateralized loans. Over-collateralization in itself, combined with liquidations, provides a reasonable level of security for lenders.\r\n\r\nCollateral risk - Origin has chosen 3 of the largest LSTs to ever exist to back OETH, and they have maintained their peg quite well since launch. They have also demonstrated significant growth in circulating supply, so the Origin team is confident that the 3 LSTs will maintain their peg and that OETH will remain stable to ETH. OETH is also using Chainlink oracles for pricing data for rETH and stETH, and plans to utilize Curve’s time-weighted price oracle for frxETH to ensure accurate pricing at all times. In situations where any OETH collateral falls below peg, [OIP-4 disables minting](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-dollar/issues/1000) of additional OETH tokens using the de-pegged asset.\r\n\r\nSmart contract risk of OETH - Origin is taking every step possible to be proactive and lessen the chance of losing funds. Security reviews are prioritized over new feature development, with regular audits being done, and multiple engineers are required to review each code change with a detailed checklist. There are timelocks before protocol upgrades are launched, and deep dives into the exploits of other protocols are constantly being done to make sure the same exploits don’t exist on Origin contracts. Security is extremely important to the Origin team. OETH was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which 10+ audits have been done since 2020. All audits can be seen on [Audits - OUSD](https://docs.oeth.com/security-and-risks/audits), and OpenZeppelin is now on retainer. On-chain insurance protocol InsurAce awarded OUSD the [highest possible security rating of AAA](https://app.insurace.io/coverage/buycovers), which only 4 projects on the InsurAce platform have received.\r\n\r\n## Relevant References\r\nOrigin was founded by Web3 veterans Josh Fraser and Matthew Liu in 2017 and is one of the most venerable projects in the space. Josh and Matthew are joined by the fully doxxed Origin [team](\"https://www.originprotocol.com/community\") and community, which includes hundreds of thousands of members and open-source contributors.

As such, this contract has ownership of all Interest Protocol contracts on Optimism. \r\n\r\nAll of the data to make these transactions happen must be carefully nested in the proposal on Mainnet. The script to do this can be found [here](https://gfx.cafe/ip/contracts/-/blob/master/scripts/proposals/SNX_OP/propose.ts)\r\n\r\nSo for example, if we are to set the new oracle on the [Oracle Master](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xBdCF0bb40eb8642f907133bDB5Fcc681D81f0651), we need to first package the data to do this, which we can call addOracleData.  \r\n\r\nThen we take this data, and use it as the \"bytes\" argument when we call call to forward(address,bytes) on the [Cross Chain Account](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x48fa7528bFD6164DdF09dF0Ed22451cF59c84130) on Optimism. This function takes two arguments, first the Oracle Master address on Optimism, and second, our addOracleData (bytes).\r\n\r\nWe take our addOracleForwardData, and pass it as the _message (bytes) when we call sendMessage(address,bytes,uint32) on the [Layer 1 Cross Chain Messenger](https://etherscan.io/address/0x25ace71c97B33Cc4729CF772ae268934F7ab5fA1#code)\r\n\r\nAssuming the Oracle Master on Optimism has its owner set to the [Cross Chain Account](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x48fa7528bFD6164DdF09dF0Ed22451cF59c84130), this should set the new relay as expected. \r\n",

The Maker Protocol issues the DAI stablecoin, and is one of the only protocols to not suffer technical exploits (there was a design exploit that resulted in some 0-bid liquidation auctions in 2020 that has since been fixed).\r\n\r\nThis collateral integration will support MKR holders’ ability to delegate MKR to a delegate contract of their choice, which is not available at any other venue.\r\n\r\nInterest Protocol already supports CHAI, which is a DappHub token wrapper for DAI Savings Rate Module deposits.\r\n\r\nBig thanks to [Llama.xyz](https://llama.xyz/) for developing the new MKR voting vaults and other contracts for this proposal. \r\n\r\n## Parameters\r\n\r\nToken Address: [0x9f8F72aA9304c8B593d555F12eF6589cC3A579A2](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9f8F72aA9304c8B593d555F12eF6589cC3A579A2)  \r\nCapped Token address: [0x2c52EE10BD58Efa20FC6ee418BF9085639E8247E](https://etherscan.io/token/0x2c52EE10BD58Efa20FC6ee418BF9085639E8247E)  \r\nLTV: 70%  \r\nLiquidation incentive: 10%  \r\nCap: 110,000 (~$1,000,000)  \r\nPrimary Oracle Address: [Chainlink](https://etherscan.io/token/0xec1d1b3b0443256cc3860e24a46f108e699484aa)  \r\nSecondary Oracle Address: [Uniswap v3](https://etherscan.io/token/0x24551a8fb2a7211a25a17b1481f043a8a8adc7f2)  \r\nPrice deviation: 10%  \r\n\r\n## Liquidity\r\n\r\nMarket Cap: $826,301,000 (circulating)  \r\nLiquidity: $17,500,000 (two combined Uniswap V3 pools)  \r\n[Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/maker) 7-day avg 24hr volume: $64,000,000  \r\nNotable exchanges: Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, OKX, Uniswap, etc  \r\n\r\n## Technical risks\r\n\r\nType of contract: ERC20\r\nUnderlying asset: Governance Token\r\nTime: November 25, 2017 (~2055 days ago)\r\nPrivileges: Can be minted by governance or excessive bad debt\r\nUpgradability: None\r\n\r\n## Relevant References\r\n\r\n[Original Forum Post](https://forums.interestprotocol.io/t/proposal-to-add-mkr/214)",

To ensure the longevity and effectiveness of these discussions, it is strongly encouraged that all participants document their suggestions in writing on the forum.

A 4-week pause has limited downside if the current protocol users are unlikely to withdraw from IP. Additionally, the pause would save approximately 410k IPT and give the community time to deliberate on an updated program.\n\n## Specification\nPause the IPT rewards distribution program for four weeks to develop a new strategy for IPT rewards. If the proposal passes, no rewards will be allocated for weeks 46-49. Upon Week 50, the current program will resume, or if a new program has been approved by governance, it will take effect.",

      "content": "\r\nProposal to add CHAI as an capped collateral to Interest Protocol.\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nCHAI is an ERC20 token developed by Dapphub that provides a tokenized representation of DAI that has been deposited into the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) module of the Maker Protocol. It accrues interest at the rate set by Maker governance for the DSR. At time of writing, that is 1%. CHAI is freely transferrable and redeemable, and is immutable with no special permissions.\r\n\r\nBecause CHAI is interest-bearing DAI redeemable with Maker, there is no risk of it becoming illiquid for its underlying (Maker issues new DAI when redeeming from the DSR). Additionally, Maker's Peg Stability Modules (PSMs) contain billions of dollar-redeemable stablecoins that DAI can be converted to and from with zero slippage.\r\n\r\nCurrently, DAI deposited in the DSR yields 1% per annum. This rate is manually adjusted by Maker governance. The stable value of CHAI in relation to DAI (and USDC, USDP, and GUSD) makes it a highly secure asset that is also yield bearing. In times that Interest Protocol charges less than CHAI yields, it allows for users to safely arbitrage the rates, resulting in higher DAI, CHAI, and USDi usage.\r\n\r\n## Parameters\r\n\r\nToken Address: [0x06AF07097C9Eeb7fD685c692751D5C66dB49c215](https://etherscan.io/address/0x06AF07097C9Eeb7fD685c692751D5C66dB49c215#code)\r\nCapped Token address: [0xDdAD1d1127A7042F43CFC209b954cFc37F203897](https://etherscan.io/address/0xDdAD1d1127A7042F43CFC209b954cFc37F203897#code)\r\nLTV: 98%\r\nLiquidation incentive: 0.75%\r\nCap: 1,000,000\r\nOracle Address: [Chi Oracle](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9Aa2Ccb26686dd7698778599cD0f4425a5231e18#code)\r\nPrice deviation: N/A\r\n\r\n## Liquidity\r\n\r\nMarket Cap: $312,076\r\nLiquidity: Equivalent to Maker PSMs; ~2 billion at time of writing\r\nVolatility: Stablecoin\r\nCoingecko 7-day avg 24hr volume: N/A\r\nNotable exchanges: N/A\r\n\r\n## Technical risks\r\n\r\nType of contract: ERC20 wrapper\r\nUnderlying asset: DAI\r\nTime: >3 Years (Created November 29, 2019)\r\nValue:\r\nPrivileges: None\r\nUpgradability: None\r\nSupplemental Information: An edge case could result in users not receiving the full interest accrued. The DSR contract (Pot) requires someone to call `drip` to update the contract's internal accounting. This function is not bundled with `exit` function, which means a user withdrawing from the DSR (with or without CHAI) would forgo any accrued interest since the last time `drip` was called.\r\n\r\n## Relevant References\r\n[Two-day audit by Trail of Bits](https://chai.money/Trail_Of_Bits-Letter_of_Attestation_Chai.pdf)\r\n[Github documentation for CHAI](https://github.com/dapphub/chai)\r\n[A front end for users to mint/burn CHAI](https://chai.money)\r\n[MakerDAO Glossary](https://docs.makerdao.com/other-documentation/system-glossary)\r\n[DAI Savings Rate documentation](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/rates-module/pot-detailed-documentation)\r\n[Code for IP's Chai Oracle Contract](https://gfx.cafe/ip/contracts/-/blob/master/contracts/oracle/External/CHI_Oracle.sol)",

UNI holders can engage in protocol governance by delegating their voting power to their address or an address of their choosing.\r\n\r\nThe LTV was initially set conservatively to 55% because UNI is an uncapped collateral. The increase to 70% will bring it in alignment with other collateral on Interest Protocol of similar risk profile.\r\n\r\nWe have not seen a ton of demand for UNI as a collateral but hopefully this increase in LTV will make IP a more competitive venue to originate loans from.\r\n\r\n### Parameters\r\nToken Address: [0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984)\r\n\r\n## Note: \r\nTo upgrade UNI's LTV, we're also including a minor code change to the `updateRegisteredErc20()` to address the bug identified by Sigma Prime in the most recent audit.",

      "content": "\nForum thread: [Proposal to change USDi rewards](https://forums.interestprotocol.io/t/proposal-to-change-usdi-rewards/117?u=getty)\n\nThe rationale and information are available on the forum thread linked above. If this proposal passes, IPT rewards will no longer be directed to UNI-v2 ETH-USDi LP token holders, and borrow incentives will decrease by 1/3. The revised methodology will go into effect in the 29th week of the IPT rewards program. Please note week 26 ends today, December 22nd, and weeks 27 & 28 will go on as planned because the governance process requires 12 days. \n\nAny secondary contract (if it is made public) with at least 100k USDi can qualify to have the IPT rewards flow through to liquidity providers. For example, the [UNI-v2 ETH-USDi](https://v2.info.uniswap.org/pair/0x63aac74200ba1737f81beeaeda64a539d9883922) pool or the [Curve USDi-3pool](https://curve.fi/#/ethereum/pools/factory-v2-133). A participant must make a forum post requesting it be added with an explanation/example of how the accounting should be handled. If the information provided is sufficient the rewards script can be modified for the following week. ",

      "content": "\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nTo grow to its maximum potential, Interest Protocol needs to decentralize its ownership and put protocol control into a large group of thoughtful and intelligent participants. We would like to introduce the Recognized Delegates Program. Five percent of the total IPT supply has been earmarked to compensate delegates and reward those active in Governance of the protocol.\r\n\r\n## Specification\r\n\r\n### Delegate Eligibility:\r\n\r\n* Be active in community discussion boards, staying sufficiently informed about challenges and solutions in the IP community.\r\n* Provide an Ethereum address and/or ENS for delegation purposes.\r\n* Include identifying details ( Delegate Name, ENS/EthereumAddress, Forum Handle(s), Alternate Means Of Contact (Twitter, Discord, Email, etc.)\r\n* Write a brief Delegate Statement (including general voting philosophy, alignment with IP goals, and why you are the best candidate), including and d a brief list of your core values, close all conflicts of interest (potential and actual), and provide a written policy on how current or future conflicts will be handled when voting.\r\n* Provide a list of authorized representatives if the Recognized Delegate is a team or institution;\r\n\r\n### Compensation Eligibility:\r\n\r\n* Communicate on the IP forum how and why a delegate voted the way they did within seven days of the close of a vote (minimum 90% of the time) in their dedicated delegate thread.\r\n* Command voting weight greater than or equal to 1 basis point of the total IPT supply;\r\n* Participate in at least 90% of all on-chain IP votes within the previous 90 days\r\n* The Recognized Delegate (or one authorized representative if a team or institution) must attend at least one public protocol development call each month.\r\n\r\n### Compensation:\r\n\r\nCommunication and vote participation metrics will use a cumulative average on a rolling window of 120 days (accounting for sickness, leave, or any other lack of activity).\r\n\r\nEach Recognized Delegate will be entitled to a monthly compensation of:\r\ny = (0.0989899*x+0.1010101)/12\r\ny = Compensation (in IPT)\r\nx = Lowest total of IPT delegated to address during that calendar month\r\n\r\nIn the event, a delegate utilizes two addresses during the same month (e.g. moving from an EOA to a multisig), the larger of the two addresses will be used for compensation purposes.\r\n\r\n### Measurement: \r\n\r\nTo ensure that the recognized delegates have met their responsibilities for compensation, an administrator will\r\n\r\n* Review delegate communication on voting and reasoning ( within the specified timeframe)\r\n* Record on-chain IP votes by delegates at vote close\r\n* Note attendance at the public protocol development meeting\r\n* Provide a summary of these metrics for all Recognized Delegates in a post on the Interest Protocol forum once per month\r\n\r\n### Administration:\r\n\r\nThe administrator will dedicate an estimated 2 hours a week, compensated at 75 USDI/hour for a flat monthly compensation of 600 USDi per month.\r\n\r\nThe initial administrator will be myself, @Feems (active DAO contributor, governance engineer, and spend my free time facilitating weekly governance education sessions ). In the event the current administrator chooses to step down, a new administrator must be appointed by a governance proposal, with the following exception:\r\n\r\nThe current administrator may train a replacement who will work under the current administrator for no less than 30 days. That replacement may take over the administrator role without a vote by IP governance, provided the current administrator provides a written statement on the forum introducing the replacement at the beginning of training and handing over the position at a date of their choosing.\r\n\r\n## cbETH\r\nChainlink has informed us that they are closing the cbETH/USD oracle in favor of their cbETH/ETH oracle. The proposed change switches will switch IP to use the cbETH/ETH oracle",

The goal of this change was to increase capital efficiency at relatively high interest rates. However, the interest rate on IP has remained low since the execution of Proposal 8. Moreover, Proposal 8 raised s1 (from 60% to 65%). As a result, IP often has a high reserve ratio above 60%, and thus a wide spread between the borrow rate and the deposit rate. This proposal aims to remedy this by lowering the reserve ratio that corresponds to low rates (1-5%).\r\n\r\n### Lower s1 and s2\r\nThe reserve ratios corresponding to the two kinks will decrease, from 65% and 35% to 50% and 25%. This will allow IP to generate more loans at a given rate, increasing capital efficiency and reducing the borrow-deposit spread.\r\n\r\n### Lower r2\r\nr2, the interest rate corresponding to the reserve ratio s2, will decrease from 20% to 10%. This further increases capital efficiency at lower rates.\r\n\r\n### Comparison to Compound\r\nThe Desmos graph compares the proposed curve to what Compound V2’s interest rate curve for USDC would be if it was directly translated to IP. While the proposed curve is more aggressive than Compound’s at lower borrow rates (below 3.17%), it is significantly more conservative at higher borrow rates (above 3.17%) and therefore continues to provide a strong guarantee of liquidity for USDi redemptions.",

The DYDX token's governance system is compatible with Interest Protocol's governance system. Users that post DYDX as collateral can maintain their voting power by delegating the voting power to another address. \r\n\r\nThe proposed parameters and cap are purposely very conservative. After the initial listing, a subsequent proposal could increase the cap.\r\n### Parameters\r\nToken Address: [0x92d6c1e31e14520e676a687f0a93788b716beff5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x92d6c1e31e14520e676a687f0a93788b716beff5)\r\nLTV: 70%\r\nLiquidation incentive: 10%\r\nCap: 3.3m (~$5m)\r\nOracle Address: [To be deployed]\r\nPrimary oracle: [Chainlink DYDX/USD](https://etherscan.io/address/0x478909D4D798f3a1F11fFB25E4920C959B4aDe0b#readContract)\r\nSecondary oracle: [Uniswap v3 DYDX/ETH](https://info.uniswap.org/home#/pools/0xe0cfa17aa9b8f930fd936633c0252d5cb745c2c3)\r\nPrice deviation: 20%\r\n\r\n\r\n### Liquidity \r\nMCAP: $200m\r\nUniswap v3 liquidity: $800k\r\n[Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dydx) 7-day avg 24hr volume: $69m\r\nNotable exchanges: Binance, Okex, FTX\r\n\r\n\r\n### Technical risks\r\n1.

The minting schedule has pre-defined upper limits.\r\n    * ‘VotingEscrow’ is the veBAL contract, which allows LPs to deposit and lock 80/20 BPT in exchange for veBAL. veBAL holders own the governance rights to the Balancer ecosystem.

      "title": "Interest Rate Curve Adjustment ",
      "content": "\n\nProposal to adjust the interest rate curve’s parameters to reduce interest rate volatility.\n\nInterest Protocol uses an interest rate curve to dynamically set the borrow and deposit rates as a function of the current reserve ratio (which equals USDC in reserve / USDi total supply). Governance has the power to adjust the parameters of the curve itself to change how each level of reserve ratio is mapped into the borrow rate and the deposit rate.\n\nThe current parameters were chosen by GFX Labs prior to launch. Based on our observations of the protocol’s operations for the past two months, we believe that the following parameter adjustments would reduce the volatility of interest rates and improve the usability of the protocol. The interest rate curve is a core component of the protocol and should be continuously improved and thoughtfully experimented with.\n\n\n\n\n| Variable | Current Value | New Value |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| s1     | 60%     | 65%     |\n| s2     | 40%     | 35%     |\n| r1     | 0.50%     | 0.50%     |\n| r2     | 10%     | 20%     |\n| r3     | 600%     | 300%     |\n\n\n[Desmos graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/lh3jws6woj)\n\n\n## Our rationale for these changes are as follows.\n**Longer s2-s1**\nThe length of the target range of the reserve ratio, [s2,s1], will increase from 20% to 30%. This is to reduce the likelihood of the reserve ratio diverging from this target range, which results in sharp fluctuations of interest rates.\n\n**Lower s2**\ns2 will decrease from 40% to 35%. GFX Labs set a very conservative s2 at launch, and we believe that reducing the target floor of the reserve ratio to 35% does not pose a significant risk to the USDi peg. By lowering s2, the protocol enables higher utilization of capital that can lower the borrow rate and increase the deposit rate.\n\n**Higher r2**\nr2 will increase from 10% to 20%. We believe the equilibrium nominal borrow rate of USDi may often stay above 10%. This is because the protocol incentivizes borrowers, which decreases the real borrow rate. Raising r2 from 10% to 20% will allow rate discovery to happen across a wider range.\n\n**Lower r3**\nr3 will decrease from 600% to 300%. This will dampen the extreme rate volatility that has been observed when the reserve ratio drops slightly below s2. The maximum rate of 300% should still be punitive enough to drive the market back towards the target range whenever the reserve ratio is below the target floor of s2.\n",
