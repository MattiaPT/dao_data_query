      "title": "VDP-157: Develop VitaDAO’s first longevity product",
      "content": "One-liner: *Develop VitaDAO’s first longevity product*\n\nTeam: Alex Dobrin, Benji Leibowitz, Lukas Weidener, Paul Kohlhaas, et al\n\nObjective: Develop scientifically-backed longevity products for the longevity community, advancing VitaDAO’s mission of promoting longevity research, and exploring new ways to deliver value to VitaDAO token holders.\n\nProject Overview: This proposal aims to create a longevity supplement product offered and co-branded by VitaDAO. The product candidates will contain the ingredients submitted in the [Longevity Prize](https://www.longevityprize.com/). These ingredients will have life extension data in C elegans. Our goal is to generate a product VitaDAO can offer its members. We hope that the sales revenue can grow the VitaDAO treasury to enable VitaDAO to fund more longevity moonshots.\n\n**Key Deliverables:**\n\n1. Data from the cocktails tested as part of the Longevity Prize\n2. Marketplace with all product candidates for pre-order\n3. Coupon codes for VITA and IP Token holders\n4. Shipments of compounds if the products receive enough preorders (200)\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1. Build a [marketplace](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bnooEfEDYdU3UCPzx9lZgwmEFZlGbkD1OGtXmOZVaGw/edit#heading=h.2ngmk2eh1k1m) to enable pre-ordering (Molecule team)\n2. List product candidates on pump.science (Web3 pod)\n3. List compounds on the marketplace for pre-ordering (Web3 pod)\n4. If any of the ~20 product candidates reaches 200 pre-orders, orders will be fulfilled\n\n  1. All manufacturing, testing, and shipping of the product will be handled by an external partner (Zola - see below)\n\n5. VitaDAO has pro rata governance of product revenues based on IPT holdings\n6. VitaDAO will work with the cocktail inventors to secure patents and publications on the ingredients in the products\n\nTimeline: 2 months\n\nBudget: $10,000\n\nThis budget will be used to purchase an initial IP Token supply to fund downstream (fly and mice) experiments as part of the [pump.science](http://pump.science) protocol (in development). In short, if the IPT price appreciates, more of this initial supply is sold programmatically to pay for in vivo longevity animal tests. If the IPT does not hit a 60k market cap within a month, the IP tokens will be sold and the proceeds (less 1% fees charged by pump.fun) returned back to VitaDAO.\n\n\n**Rationale**\n\nTo date, VitaDAO has been singularly focused on funding ambitious longevity research. However, there has been little experimentation around creating consumer products for VitaDAO members that align with the mission of radical lifespan extension. Given VitaDAO’s expertise in biotech, developing a life extension supplement could provide immediate value to its community. While human data on the longevity effects of specific compounds is still limited, VitaDAO has a unique opportunity to generate valuable datasets by engaging its members to test which products positively impact lifespan through biomarkers. Delivering the same product to members is a first step in this direction.\n\nA first product candidate should have the following criteria met:\n\n1. The product’s ingredients are classified as a supplements or food additives, which will accelerate the speed we can bring the product to members\n2. The product should be relatively low cost to VitaDAO to produce to minimize the financial risk of a pilot\n3. The ingredients should have evidence of lifespan extension in (at least) model organisms, ideally with a synergistic effect\n4. The ingredients should have validated demand within the community prior to productization\n\nIn [VDP-156](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-156-develop-and-launch-vitamycin-for-vitadao-token-holders/1730) there was strong disagreement with the choice of rapamycin as the active ingredient. Not everyone agrees on what the optimal first product ingredients are, so rather than arbitrarily determine this, we would ideally let the market decide. Neither a survey nor governance actually measure demand, as neither demonstrate a willingness to pay. A marketplace with products for preorder will most accurately measure demand.\n\n**Why the partnership with Zola Nutrition**\n\n[Zola Nutrition](https://zolanutrition.com/) is a supplement brand and manufacturer with operations based in Austria. We are exploring a partnership that would help VitaDAO ship a first product via a co-branding deal, where profits will be split between VitaDAO and Zola. We will handle the scientific side (research, whitepaper, formulation) and Zola will manage all logistical services (including sourcing, quoting, formulation, packaging, branding, third party testing, fulfillment and shipping). While we are confident that a partnership with Zola Nutrition can happen, there is nothing tangible in place and a deal will only be pursued after the successful passing of this proposal. If for unforeseen reasons the partnership won’t be closed, we will actively search for comparable opportunities for co-branding and development.\n\n**Why the partnership with pump.science**\n\n[pump.science](http://pump.science) (PS) is a product for submitting longevity cocktails, tokenizing them, securing the IP, fundraising for in vivo experiments, and streaming the data to users. We think it should be easy to launch a longevity experiment, create a clear path to a potential product, and create a more engaging and interactive experience for users. We want PS to bring more funding and engagement for longevity research, and create a pipeline for longevity products.\n\nIn its pilot launch, PS generated significant interest and engagement that can be leveraged for VitaDAO’s benefit:\n\n1. Driving funding to IP created by VitaDAO\n2. Driving attention and demand to purchase any products VitaDAO commercializes\n3. Enabling research for the compounds originally tested on worms to be tested in flies and mice\n\n**Benefit to VitaDAO Members**\n\nUltimately, this is an effort to benefit members of VitaDAO by providing members with access to cutting edge longevity supplements. Our goal is to provide members with the most cutting edge longevity products for personal consumption at low prices.. This effort is also intended to support VitaDAO by generating revenue to the treasury to fund more moonshot longevity science.",

      "content": "Summary\n\nFormally declare VitaDAO a Vitalist Organization via agreement with the [Vitalist Declaration](https://www.vitalism.io/vitalist-declaration).\n\nDetails\n\nVitalism is a moral and philosophical movement whose goals revolve around advocacy and political influence. The [Vitalism Whitepaper](https://www.vitalism.io/vitalism-whitepaper) put forth the north star goal of mobilizing 1% of global GDP into the fight against aging and death. Organizations and individuals can consider themselves Vitalist if they agree with the Vitalist Declaration:\n\n1. Life and health are good. Death is humanity’s core problem, and aging its primary agent.\n2. Aging causes immense suffering, and obviating aging is scientifically plausible.\n3. Humanity should apply the necessary resources to reach freedom from aging as soon as possible.\n4. I will work on or support others to work on reaching unlimited healthy human lifespan.\n5. I will carry the message against aging and death.\n\nSince its formation, VitaDAO has been acting in accordance with the Vitalist Declaration. By formally declaring our agreement with the Declaration and therefore declaring ourselves a Vitalist Organization, we gain access to a growing Vitalist network of organizations, entrepreneurs, scientists, and other individuals who are philosophically aligned and actively taking actions to achieve the goal.\n\nDeclaring VitaDAO a Vitalist Organization will help facilitate:\n\n* Collaborating on initiatives with similar goals, such as VitaDAO’s network state goals and the Vitalism Foundation’s goal to facilitate longevity jurisdictions\n* Contributing VitaDAO’s voices and opinions to the list of beneficial regulatory changes the Vitalism Foundation and politically-inclined Vitalists should support\n* Mutual sharing of benefits between mobilized Vitalists and VitaDAO members\n* Being listed as a Vitalist Organization in the Vitalism Foundation’s events and outreach\n* Expanding our network to mobilized and dedicated Vitalists who are not familiar with the DAO\n\nBudget\n\nNo budget is required or requested.",

      "content": "### One-liner\nProject Ab4AD aims to identify antibodies that protect against Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by examining immune responses to specific pathogens, with the goal of developing early diagnostic tools and preventive therapies.\n\n### Team\nPrincipal Investigator: Dr. Daniel Bar\nProject Managers: Ella McCarthy-Page, Aidin Kazemizadeh, David Falvo, Logan Bishop-Currey, Benji Leibowitz\nSourcer: Lutz Kummer\nKey Researchers and Collaborators: Dr. Omer Bender, Dr. Naor Sagy\n\n### Simple Summary\nProject Ab4AD focuses on identifying antibodies in elderly individuals without dementia that protect against Alzheimer's Disease. By comparing these immune responses to those of AD patients, the project aims to develop diagnostic tools and therapies that can predict and prevent AD, offering new hope for millions of people and their families.\nProblem\nAlzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease responsible for 60–70% of dementia cases, characterized by amyloid β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and sustained inflammation. The \"pathogen/infection hypothesis\" suggests chronic infections may trigger sporadic AD onset. Evidence supports the involvement of pathogens like Porphyromonas gingivalis, Herpes Simplex Virus 1, and Chlamydia pneumoniae in AD. While exposure to these pathogens is common, only some individuals develop AD, suggesting specific immune responses may modulate disease risk.\n\n### Solution\nProject Ab4AD proposes to:\n\nScreen saliva and blood samples from non-demented elderly for antibodies against AD-linked pathogens.\nUse complete human proteomics to identify auto-antibodies for brain proteins.\nCompare immune responses of No-AD, AD patients, and younger controls to various pathogens.\nIdentify pathogenic proteins recognized by each group's immune system and find significant differences.\n\n### Goals\n\nIdentify protective antibodies against AD\nBuild a predictive model of immune-dependent AD-avoidance\nProvide an early diagnostic tool\nEstablish a path toward vaccine development\n\n### Opportunity\nUnmet Clinical Need\nCurrent AD treatments focus on symptom management rather than addressing underlying causes. There's a critical need for therapies that can prevent or slow disease progression.\nMarket Potential\nThe global Alzheimer's disease treatment market was valued at $4.9 billion in 2020, projected to reach $13.7 billion by 2027.\nVision and Long-Term Objectives\n\nDevelop early diagnostic tools\nCreate preventive and therapeutic solutions\nEstablish predictive models\nAdvance understanding of AD pathogenesis\n\n### Expected Outcomes\n\nIdentification of protective antibodies\nDevelopment of predictive models\nCreation of early diagnostic tools\nTherapeutic development\n\n### Relevance to Longevity\nThis project addresses key aspects of aging and age-related diseases:\n\nTargets altered intercellular communication\nMitigates effects of chronic inflammation and infections on brain health\nSeeks to understand protection against dementia despite chronic infection\nContributes to extending healthspan and lifespan\n\n### IP Roadmap\n\nKit for AD risk identification\nAntibodies for AD treatment\nTargets for AD vaccine\n\n### Experimental Plan\n We will identify a differential immune response to AD-associated pathogens between AD, Non-AD and C individuals (aim 1), identify a differential immune response to human brain proteins (aim 2) and validate our findings using independent methods (aim 3). A successful completion of these aims would support the hypothesis that a specific immune response modulates the risk of developing AD. It will also enable a testable, quick and cost-effective way to validate these findings on different cohorts, both by us and by others.\n\n\n![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 12.03.17.png](ipfs://bafkreidwnfbdm2f7brdgjt4ln423bkejpswygt6oqszlxm74edmm2oebpy)\n    \n![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 12.02.27.png](ipfs://bafkreifema6j65mtoganph6s3t6yxw4teogrilg6hitosoz2i4gch2q4ka)\n\nBudget and Costs\n \n \n![Screenshot 2024-08-07 at 12.04.45.png](ipfs://bafkreia2ivi2nuzjxhf66h2p24vd74wuovarkwja3jaurwh72auebzukte)\n    \nThis proposal requests $50k (27% of total budget) from VitaDAO.

      "title": "VDP-152 [Funding] Project TransFidelity ",
      "content": "One-liner\nProject TransFidelity aims to develop small molecules and peptides that enhance translation fidelity to prevent harmful protein misfolding, thereby addressing neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s from their root cause.\n\n### Team\nPrincipal Investigator: Dr. Dimitri Scherbakov\n\nProject Managers: Ella McCarthy-Page, Kishore Kumar, Amine Chaherli, Benji Leibowitz\n\nSourcer: Michele Gallia\n\nKey Researchers and Collaborators: Dr. Rashid Akbergenov, Prof. Dr. David Wolfer, Prof. Dr. Dennis Gillingham\n\n### Simple Summary\nProject TransFidelity focuses on preventing neurodegenerative diseases by improving the accuracy of protein synthesis, thereby reducing the formation of harmful protein aggregates. This approach targets the root cause of these diseases, aiming to provide a novel treatment strategy that goes beyond symptom management. This proposal is to provide $50k USD in (ETH) funding for the project.\n\n### Problem\nNeurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s are devastating conditions that affect millions worldwide. These diseases are driven by the misfolding and aggregation of proteins, which leads to brain cell death and cognitive decline. Project TransFidelity aims to solve this by improving the accuracy of protein synthesis, preventing harmful protein misfolding from the start.\n\n### Solution\nProject TransFidelity proposes a novel approach to treating NDDs by improving the fidelity of protein translation. This strategy addresses the core problem of protein misfolding at its source. By identifying compounds that enhance translation fidelity, we aim to prevent the formation of toxic protein aggregates. Think of it as upgrading the factory’s quality control system to ensure that only correctly assembled proteins are made.\n\n### Opportunity\nBy improving the accuracy of ribosomes, we can reduce the production of faulty proteins. Here’s how our approach works:\n\nSmall Molecules and Peptides: Screen molecules that help ribosomes print proteins more accurately.\nReducing Misfolded Proteins: Once the protein has been printed, it needs to be folded into its correct form. With fewer errors, folding accuracy improves. It reduces the working load to the cell’s cleanup system and decreases protein aggregation with its negative consequences such as chronic inflammation.\nEasing Cellular Stress: Reducing the rate of misfolded proteins eases the burden on our cell systems, granting them the ability to spend more energy on cell vital functions, resulting in cells that function better and stay healthy longer.\nThe ultimate goal is to develop new treatments that halt or reverse the progression of NDDs,\n\nproviding new hope for millions of patients.\n\n### Budget\nThis proposal, if passed, will allocate $50k (in ETH) of the $100k allocated to Catalyst projects as part of VDP-147 2. Again, if the terms are not agreed upon by the funders, then the ETH will be returned to VitaDAO.\n\n### Senior Review Digest - Quantitative\nThe project was reviewed by four reviewers: a scientist, an entrepreneur, a VC, and a professor.\nBelow is the average scores from the reviewers out of 5 per category.\n\nAverage Scores\n\nTeam Expertise: 3.5\nFeasibility & Data: 3.0\nCommercial Potential & Impact: 4.3\nNovelty & Market Advantage: 3.5\nIP Defensibility: 2.8\nRelevance to Longevity: 4.5\nDeal Terms: N/A (the terms have not yet been set)\nGeneral Conviction Score 3.0 (for reference, the average score of past funded projects is 3.7)\nThe majority of the reviewers think that this project is a moonshot.\n\nTwo reviewers recommended that the project should be advanced for token-holders vote, one that it should be followed-up with the applicant for more information, one that it should be denied outright giving constructive feedback.\n\n### Senior Review Digest - Qualitative\nEach reviewer was asked whether they would endorse the project, as well as the pros and cons they see: below are their answers.\n\nReviewer 1\nUntil the group can find new chemical entities there is limited commercial viability and I would not endorse the project. Also, data are contradictory regarding enhancing/reducing translation and the researchers have no drug target in mind other than a biological process. Systemically changing anything in the body is a bad idea.\n\nPros\nDysregulation of translation is known in a lot of diseases. Targeting it might be beneficial.\n\nCons\nNo molecular target and no viable IP.\nSystemically targeting translation is likely dangerous and the literature suggesting enhancing/decreasing has both positive/negative consequences.\nTeam lacks any BD/Development experience.\n\nReviewer 2\nI am familiar with most of the past potential projects that VitaDAO has brought to the table, and this is one of the strongest so far. It has my clear endorsement.\n\nPros\nKnown mode-of-action, allowing to deploy the typical paths to bring a target/drug to market.\nEvolutionarily conserved and robust lifespan extension in invertebrates and unicellular models.\nDisruptive potential of a huge market.\n\nCons\n\nMammalian pro-longevity results lacking.\nAggravating this mode-of-action clearly shortens lifespan and compromises health, but breaking a system is dissimilar and easier than improving upon it.\n\nReviewer 3\nI’d put this in the top 50% of project i’ve reviewed, but not top 10%. The research seems interesting and worth supporting; likely a reasonable project for VitaDAO to fund.\n\nPros\nSolid academic foundation.\nConceptually promising approach.\nFeasible patent plan.\n\nCons\nLack of clinical/regulatory experience.\nCrowded market concerns.\nIndirect alignment with longevity mission.\n\nReviewer 4\nAt this stage I would endorse the idea behind the project but not the project itself. This is a very early stage research which is likely to fail within the timeframe of the proposed project as a lot more research is required to improve feasibility. Nevertheless, the idea is exciting and I would be happy to discuss it publicly or even become involved scientifically.\n\nPros\nNovelty of the approach.\nEvidence of chemistry with apparently desired biological effect.\nGood expertise in biology with support from medicinal chemist.\n\nCons\nvery early stage project with uncertainties about whether improving translation fidelity would have any benefit for health/longevity/disease prevention.\nresearch programme is broad with no guarantee of success.",

      "title": "VDP-146 [Funding] The development of oligonucleotide drugs for healthspan",
      "content": "**One-liner:** *To generate a new RNA drug capable of activating a human healthspan switch mediated by the FOXO3 gene*\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG team\n\n* **Scientific evaluation:** 1 biotech executive, 1 VC, 1 biotech manager, 2 academics\n* **Shepherd:** Adrian Matysek\n* **Other squad members:** Eleanor Davies, Paolo Binetti\n* **Sourced by:** Adrian Matysek\n* **Project PI:** Lorna Harries, PhD\n\n## Simple Summary\nFOXO3 is a major longevity gene, which acts as a central integration point for many aspects of cellular health and stress resilience, especially in the context of ageing and its associated diseases. Prof. Lorna Harries has identified a druggable mode of action for a longevity-associated genetic variant in the FOXO3 gene, which regulates FOXO3 isoform usage and has potential to act as a ‘switch’ for longevity and improved health span in humans. Here, she plans to exploit this finding by developing a portfolio of oligonucleotide drugs which act to influence FOXO3 isoform usage and to evaluate these in vitro and in vivo.\n\n[Full proposal on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-146-funding-the-development-of-oligonucleotide-drugs-for-healthspan/1653)\n\n## Problem\nAt present, we take a reactive, rather than proactive, approach to ageing and its associated diseases. The UK Chief Medical Officer’s Health in an Ageing society report in 2023 (which Prof. Harries contributed to) highlighted these issues; whilst we may be living longer, we are not living better. A better approach to dealing with the multimorbidity of ageing needs to be applied (1). \n\nThe FOXO3 gene represents one such pivotal intervention point. FOXO3 forms part of an evolutionarily conserved central hub network which integrates multiple molecular and cellular inputs that regulate cellular and organismal ageing (2).\n\n## Solution\nThe FOXO3 gene produces multiple RNA transcripts including 3 linear isoforms (FOXO3-long and FOXO3-short) and a circular RNA (circFOXO3). The longevity haplotype resides in the region of a bioinformatically-predicted alternative promoter and non-coding first exon located in intron 2, and my team proposed in 2021 that it may determine the relative expression of long and short FOXO3 isoforms (8).\n\nMy proposed approach is to design a precise intervention that acts only on very specific sequences within the FOXO3 gene alone to upregulate FOXO3-long isoforms or decrease FOXO3-short isoforms, or both in combination, and thus mimic the effects of inheritance of the longevity haplotype on FOXO3 isoform expression in those that do not possess it.\n\n## Opportunity\nThis project will allow us to drug the isoform specific expression of FOXO3, a known geroprotective gene, for physiological enhancement of its activity in a precise and tuneable manner. \n\nThe value of a drug that is able to cause even a 1 year increase in healthspan is estimated at $38 trillion. A 10 year increase in healthspan equates to $367 trillion.\n\n\n## Relevance to Longevity\nSuccessful design of an oligonucleotide therapeutic targeting a known geroprotective gene would impact multiple aspects of longevity, healthspan and lifespan. FOXO3 is one of only a handful of genes reliably and reproducibly associated with extreme longevity, which highlights its role as a systemic geroprotector. \n\n## IP Roadmap\n​​The data packages produced from funding these early stages of this work would form the basis for a patent application to protect the IP. I envisage the end point of the initial funding would be to file an initial application. C. elegans, although a simple organism will fulfil at least part of the necessity for an in vivo model if therapeutic claims are to be made. Following filing, claims would be bolstered by provision of additional data from more complex in vivo systems within the following 12 months, this would be contingent on further funding. Figure 4 illustrates the path to IND status we would take.\n\n**![|602x308](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WbOSh2EqTiUDaVEGjFB-zsWrysKqWQ3z1VBXICZ6ciPdhYjcEPj27G6g-h7U19-LlLDA7HpGU66W6gYT1m-IhKsRQRL3kZqtsGwh73_Y1mENqhbBCAf1kt3dBYJ_VFIYbSdXSbUwVDzlQifmbfCylTM)**\n\n**![|602x267](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jUqpVPxgMHzQ-K1RwJTdasehYAEIbYGYczTPln0UH3O6aDYjNxuDd5U4AeB8eQvObomjYa4QF0p8UNJhX5bKdsfyiAZJYsrr3ebv4ZElWvHl9JK7sRLsuNjBLMoeHTCBinqWcZqOSZoLusK8HjfGiaU)**\n\n**Figure 4: The path to clinical for a new oligonucleotide geroprotective drug**\n\n## Experimental Plan\n\n### Hypothesis\nTargeted moderation of FOXO3 isoform expression profiles will attenuate cellular ageing phenotypes in vitro and being healthspan and lifespan benefits in vivo.\n\n### Objectives\n**Milestone 1:** To use oligonucleotides to influence FOXO3 isoform expression in human primary fibroblasts (dermal and lung), endothelial cells and skeletal muscle cells, and measure effect on FOXO3-FL and TR isoform levels, FOXO3 activity and subcellular localisation, autophagy and mitochondrial function, and on the phenotype and rate of accumulation of senescent cells. \n\n**Milestone 2:** To specifically express human FOXO3-FL or FOXO3-TR isoforms or both, in a transgenic C. elegans model followed by assessment of lifespan or healthspan parameters (movement, avoidance of noxious stimuli, lipofucin accumulation, lifespan). \nThe experimental plan is illustrated in figure 5 below.\n\n**![|570x378](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/gKTMEi2kQLYMELnf124QxG-gmLsRSkKyUDQ_qD26PdGbufwDTjexofJhiG2vyUi3tOQ3_hYcQvGEkwDZgyNjPLv1Lgi09qCIqeNVWrir1xHYY9WGmhkZOl1gcphz09S2UmX-kQo6dNQZA_1luCUDS1g)**\n\n**Figure 5: Diagrammatic workplan of proposed project.** *A.

The group is comprised of key stakeholders with significant VITA holdings, and is limited to seven members (\"pizza team\"), though not all seats have to be taken at all times. \n\n- **Application criteria and requirements**\n    - Members who are at the top 1% of governance power (inclusively of delegated tokens) can apply to become Guardians. The exact threshold will be determined based on the analysis of top token holders provided by [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/token/0x81f8f0bb1cb2a06649e51913a151f0e7ef6fa321#balances) or a similar source. Members are allowed to serve as delegatees to get to the minimum amount of tokens required for candidacy.\n    - Where Guardians have the opportunity to be rewarded for performing their oversight responsibilities well, through the granting of additional governance power, there also is a need to establish commitment and a sense of urgency for Guardians. Therefore, Guardians must be prepared to risk a limited amount of their existing governance power should their performance not meet quantifiable performance metrics.\n    - Guardians shall host internal meetings every two weeks and hold a semi-annual face-to-face gathering. These meetings are critical for setting the agenda and overseeing high-level mandates for Pods and Pod Leads. The agenda and main outcomes of these meetings should be openly communicated to Pod Leads & the broader VITA community.\n   - While Pod Leads can serve as Guardians, this is not a hard a requirement.\n- **Detailed responsibilities**\n    1. Assigning/terminating Pod Leads: Guardians shall have the right and responsibility to assign and terminate Pod Leads autonomously and negotiate terms privately on a case-by-case basis. Guardians have the duty to communicate the assignment/termination of any Pod Lead openly to the community. Finally, any community member can push VDPs in appeal for any assignment/termination.\n   2. Terminating fellow Guardians: Guardians shall have the right and responsibility to keep other Guardians accountable and terminate those that fail to meet expected standards of performance, commitment or work ethics. Any termination must be communicated to the community and any community member can push VDPs in appeal for that termination. Decisions to terminate a Guardian should follow the Modified Consensus framework. \n   3. Budgetary framework: Guardians are responsible for setting a budgetary framework for each Pod. However, the detailed allocation and management of this budget falls under Pod Leads’ purview. Moreover, Guardians have the authority to veto budget decisions that diverge from the established mandate or mission of VitaDAO and potential attack vectors ([See ENS DAO](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/introducing-veto-ensdao-eth/19088)). This veto power is a critical aspect of their role, as it allows them to maintain strategic alignment and prevent deviations from the organization's core goals and values. Along with the veto, Guardians should provide a detailed explanation and constructive feedback to Pod Leads, outlining why the budget decision does not align with VitaDAO's mission or mandate.\n   4. Strategic planning/direction: Guardians will be responsible for interfacing with Pod Leads and suggesting strategic directions.\n   5. Performance review & reporting: Guardians will have the key responsibility of reviewing the performance of Pod Leads and auditing their progress. The main output of this effort should be in the form of a community-wide report to all token holders. This reporting shall be done through an open community call to be held on a quarterly basis.\n   6. Guardians agree to adhere to the [**Modified Consensus Process**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TgxVsKHsepU2M6BXvpVSb9fDXCVY52izQk6vgAiZ6n0/edit) for decision making.\n\n### **Pods**\n\nThis proposal establishes the creation of two Pods: the Longevity Pod and the Web3 Pod. Pods should be seen as executional units led by a Pod Lead and operating with significant autonomy. Each Pod will be responsible for executing a specific mandate under the constraint of having a budget approved by Guardians. Furthermore, Pods will outline an operational scope, have leadership responsibilities, manage the budget autonomously and report progress bi-weekly directly to Guardians. Pod Leads will be directly supported by Guardians and a nest of DAO contributors.\n     \n \n![Screenshot 2024-06-23 at 12.59.54.png](ipfs://bafybeigbk3uizdqbnsy6j4imikkcbawrbjbwjgvvt5haa5npupzvdxjlwy)\n    \n \n![Screenshot 2024-06-23 at 13.07.02.png](ipfs://bafybeicoejsxwbn4sx2bdh7dia6an3r5vd34qlhylauovgxjy3tdbmr76q)\n \n![Screenshot 2024-06-23 at 13.07.21.png](ipfs://bafybeickcy2k32zct5a5vj7q5kg32tcb6lq3ml4nrt4ddgnsd5ft5dxsbi)\n    \n    \n### Budget and Compensation\n\nA thorough compensation framework will be presented and vetted by the community in a separate proposal. This VDP outlines some of the high-level components upon which the new proposal shall be based:\n\n- Elected Guardians shall be entitled to receive recognition from the DAO based on their oversight/governance performance in the form of additional governance power.  The performance metrics and mechanisms used to establish the granting of further governance power will be proposed separately as part of an overarching compensation framework. The allocation will be determined based on aggregated responsibilities (e.g., if they’re also executing as Pod Leads) and an yearly performance evaluation. Moreover, a mechanism which, if a Guardian fails to meet expected standards of performance or work ethics, could result in a reduction in governance power is anticipated.\n- Pod Leads receive competitive salaries that should be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.\n- Contributors compensation will be project-specific within Pods’ budgets and should be based on the [OBRA](https://forum.safe.global/t/discussion-safe-dao-resource-allocation-model-obra/1001) model.\n\n## **Implementation**\n\nThe new structure will be implemented through a phased approach, starting with Pod Formation and Guardians elections. \n\n1. **Establishment of Pods**\n    - If approved, this proposal greenlights the creation of the Longevity and the Web3 Pod. These Pods can be incorporated as limited companies in any jurisdiction deemed strategic for its operations.\n    - Contributors currently working under the Working Group scheme can be relocated to one of the Pods according to its internal demands. Service provider contracts that are currently active between VitaDAO Global Services (VGS) and contributors or their legal entities will either be terminated or transferred in full to one of the Pods. In both cases, the affected party shall be notified immediately.\n    - Ongoing initiatives like The Longevist, Ambassadors Program, etc, will also automatically fall under one of the new Pods and budgeting shall be reevaluated by the lead. For gap periods where there’s no assigned lead for a given Pod, all initiatives underneath that Pod shall be directly managed by Guardians or fully interrupted until a new lead takes over.\n2. **Guardians election**\n    - The election will be conducted through a single Snapshot vote, utilizing a weighted voting mechanism. This method allows tokenholders to express their support for multiple candidates (or none), distributing their vote proportionally according to their preferences and ensuring a democratic and representative selection process that reflects the collective decision of the VitaDAO community. Candidates that receive the highest aggregate support will be elected as Guardians. The initial election will nominate no more and no less than 5 people to serve as Genesis Guardians. Two seats will remain open so as to incentivize greater contribution from members that aspire to serve as Guardians. The election or nomination of new members shall be held at any time.\n3. **Appointment of Pod Leads**\n    - Once elected, Guardians will be responsible for hiring and onboarding top-tier talent to lead each one of the Pods. Though Guardians will be responsible for carrying out interviews, reference checks and negotiating terms, any community member can suggest candidates to serve as Guardians. A contributor that manages to source a candidate that ends up being hired as Pod Lead will be fairly compensated for the effort.\n    - Guardians shall also serve as Pod Leads if deemed the right person to take over the role. There should be a hard limit of no more than 50% of Guardians serving as Pod Leads at any given time.",

      "title": "VDP-139 [Funding] Luminova: mtON gene therapy in the aged eye ",
      "content": "*One-liner: Rejuvenating mitochondrial function by harnessing the power of light*\n\nNotes:\n*Due to Snapshot’s character number limitation, this proposal is an abridged version of the [full proposal available on Discourse.](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-139-funding-luminova-mton-gene-therapy-in-the-aged-eye/1594/35)*\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG team\n* Senior Reviewers: Project has been evaluated by 3 academics and 1 biotech executive\n* Shepherd: Maria Marinova\n* Other squad members: Eleanor Davies, Cassy Le, Adrian Matysek\n* Sourced by: Jason Mercurio\n\n## Project PI\n* Dr Shahaf Peleg\n\n## Simple Summary\nLuminova Biotech holds exclusive rights to mtON technology, enabling mammalian cells to convert light energy into chemical energy, thus generating ATP independently of oxidative phosphorylation. This technology has improved lifespan and health in C. elegans and is effective in human and mouse cells. It offers promising applications, particularly in treating age-related human vision loss, representing a significant advancement in treating internal organs.\n\n## Problem\nOlder individuals suffer from age-associated vision loss and an increased prevalence of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes, which together impair eye function. Specifically, reduced oxygen transport, mitochondrial dysfunction, and accumulation of lipofuscin are involved in vision loss with aging and related maladies.\n[Full proposal on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-139-funding-luminova-mton-gene-therapy-in-the-aged-eye/1594/35).\n\n## Solution\nThe core of Luminova’s solution is mtON technology, a novel and disruptive approach. mtON is an engineered, light-activated proton pump localized to metazoan mitochondria. This technology is designed to power mitochondrial function independently of metabolism and oxygen.\n[Full proposal on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-139-funding-luminova-mton-gene-therapy-in-the-aged-eye/1594/35).\n\n## Opportunity\nThe projected longevity market is estimated to reach $270 billion by 2024, driven by a growing population experiencing vision loss. Currently, over 300 million people suffer from moderate to severe vision impairment, a number expected to increase by 50% over the next 25 years.\n[Full proposal on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-139-funding-luminova-mton-gene-therapy-in-the-aged-eye/1594/35).\n\n## Experimental plan and budget\nMILESTONE 1: Assess the bio-distribution of mtON in the mouse eye\n\nThe team will use AAV2/9 and use two methods of injections of AVV-mtON in the eye. The team will then observe the type of cells that express mtON and confirm its mitochondrial localization. Next, the team will proceed with in vivo assessment of mtON activity functionality of mtON in isolated mitochondria. Finally, the team will determine the optimal dosage of the AVV for the next steps.\n\nMILESTONE 2 – Assess the therapeutic benefit of mtON in the mouse eye\nA) The team will test if mtON attenuates age-associated vision loss. The team will first inject AAV-mtON to the eye of old mice and test whether neuronal activity and metabolic rates of retinal cells are improved, along with vision. In parallel, the team will inject AVV-mtON in 8 months old mice to test a preventive approach and follow up with the mice until they reach old age. \nB) In parallel, the team will employ a diabetic retinopathy mouse model by injecting STZ to mice. Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by a hypoxic environment, mitochondrial dysfunction, and an accumulation of toxic byproducts and mtON treatment is an ideal gene therapy. \nCollectively, this proposal will allow the team to conduct a thorough pre-clinical trial in mice that will provide a suitable basis to move forward towards clinical trials in humans. This will also be the first critical step to translating mtON technology into humans – not only to treat aging, but to eventually explore the potential for enhancing human longevity through the integration of partially solar-powered mechanisms.\n\nPending successful results, we will seek funding to continue clinical trials in a timely manner.\n\n## Budget\n$140,000 for two years\n\n## VitaDAO Funding Terms\nThis project will be funded via a Joint Development Agreement, to collaboratively develop a project. Luminova retains ownership of the intellectual property, while using IP-NFT and IPT technology for project management and governance. Based on funding amounts for this joint development project ($140,000 VitaDAO and Luminova $30,000), IPT initial distribution would be: Luminova: 17.65% and VitaDAO 82.35%. Luminova will pay non-Luminova IPT holders 5% of proceeds. Funding, profits, and decision-making processes are shared, with a condition of Luminova regaining full control of the project when a 5 million seed round is raised. Finer details will be ironed out in ongoing negotiation.\n\n1. Timeline\n![|602x168](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/fcbd9326f51aa38e563140c770501c73ac102189_2_1204x336.png)\n\n## Relevance to Longevity\nThe project focuses on combating age-related vision loss. Successfully treating this condition promises to significantly improve life quality for the elderly.\n\nThe project's ambitions aim to demonstrate that the treatment, starting with the eye, could be an approach to slow down or reverse aging in the entire body.\n\nThe project covers the fundamental challenges of aging: cellular senescence, mitochondrial dysfunction, accumulation of toxic waste, and systemic vascular decline.\n\n## Team\nDr. Shahaf Peleg, Project Lead\n* PhD Georg-August-Universität Göttingen 2010; BSc Ben Gurion University, Beer Sheva 2006\n* Tenured Group Leader at the Research-Institute for Farm Animal Biology (FBN), Dummerstof, Germany\n* Luminova Biotech, CEO\n\nDr. Andrew Wojtovich\n* Assoc. Prof. Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine (SMD)\n* Assoc. Prof. Department of Pharmacology and Physiology (SMD), University of Rochester\n* Luminova Biotech, CSO\n\nPeter Hungerford\n* Luminova Biotech, CFO\n\n## Strengths\nInnovative Approach: Luminova's focuses on rejuvenating mitochondrial function through the groundbreaking use of optogenetics.\n\nExclusive Technology: Luminova Biotech holds exclusive rights to mtON technology, a light-activated proton pump engineered to enhance mitochondrial function independently of oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nStrategic Target: Focusing on mitochondrial membrane potential as a target is strategic, given its central role in aging. \n\nApplication to Aging Phenotype: The project aims to improve the aging phenotype by targeting age-related vision loss as an early-stage proxy. \n\nAmbitious Long-Term Vision: Luminova's long-term vision involves upgrading mtON for functionality in inner organs, with the ambitious goal of whole-body mtON gene therapy to increase human longevity. \n\n## Risks\nEarly Stage Technology: The project's reliance on a relatively untested method in higher organisms – using light energy for mitochondrial stimulation – is a significant risk. \n\nLong Development Timeline: From initial research to clinical trials and technological advancements for treatment of inner organs, the timeline can span many years, if not decades.\n\nComplexity in Treating Aging: Aging is a complex and multifactorial process. While the project aims to address several aging-related issues simultaneously, the interplay of these factors in aging is not fully understood. \n\n## Luminova pitch [recording and transcript](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ze7WREeekUgb3ykdyP158GEsSyoAKW6p)\n\n## Senior Review\n**Senior Review Digest - Quantitative**\nBelow is the average scores out of 5 per category from 4 reviewers, who all recommended that the project should be advanced for token-holder vote.\n\n**Average Scores**\nTeam Expertise: 3.75\nFeasibility & Data: 4\nCommercial Potential & Impact: 3.5\nNovelty & Market Advantage: 4\nIP Defensibility: 4\nRelevance to Longevity: 4\nEvaluation summary: 3.75\nDeal Terms: 3.5\nGeneral Conviction Score 3.8 (for reference, the average score of past funded projects is 3.7)\n\n**Senior Review Digest - Qualitative**\n**Reviewer 1**\nOverall positive.

      "title": "VDP-144 The Longevist Annual Review",
      "content": "**TLDR:** This proposal asks the VitaDAO community to fund The Longevist for 2024. The following are a list of The Longevist’s inaugural year 2023 accomplishments and 2024 and beyond plans.\n\n![|340x48](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/d470a1e29f2b20d9d960e72a0a493c647d790370.png)\n\n![|602x364](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/063b1b656738706ba457eb1cf65febb03156d6c6.png)\n\n**Background:** [The Longevist](https://www.longevist.xyz/) is a quarterly issued preprint overlay journal where key opinion leaders in both academia and industry vote on chain on the top preprints, to provide a new way to identify the best longevity research. Currently, The Longevist has 30+ voters “Curators” each quarter. Therefore, it contrasts quantitatively with journals in that there are many more voters on the research. Also, arguably the voters are more experienced than journal editors. In addition to these differences, VitaDAO started The Longevist for several additional reasons:\n\nTo increase VitaDAO’s visibility amongst longevity researchers\nTo allow researchers to be compensated for their time reviewing research\nTo grow the longevity research community’s awareness in onchain technologies (through VITA token compensation for Curators / referral bounties for readers, Snapshot voting mechanism and general intro to VitaDAO/DeSci).\n\n**Proposal:** We, The Longevist team, ask the VitaDAO community to continue supporting The Longevist for 2024. We believe it is in line with VitaDAO’s 2024-25 Mandate in that it will help to identify commercially viable early-stage longevity projects whilst also fostering community growth and bringing increased crypto awareness.\n\nTo highlight why we think The Longevist deserves further funding, we highlight the 2023 achievements below:\n\n## The Longevist achievements:\n* We have onboarded 30+ key opinion leaders (aka The Longevist Curators) into the VitaDAO ecosystem as token holders, including top academics and industry experts.\n* The inaugural edition of The Longevist was launched in July 2023. We have now delivered 4 Editions (one each quarter of 2023). Each of the top 3 preprints of each quarter are awarded “Curators’ Choice” status and adorned with human:AI hybrid cover art.\n\n![img_3](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/3b853fd3b3f75d522f370407414dc4c8ad559b91.png)\n\n* Our unique curation style has helped identify and promote top longevity research, with several Longevist-featured preprints having already been published in top journals.\n\n![img_4](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/62d30e7dd5b21159cc2cb3665dfd8328f29e7dca.png)\n\n![img_5](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/1c8090481fefd19763ac19901e8cbb4c79e632e0.png)\n\n* The Longevist was assigned an International Standard Serial Number [([ISSN 2817-8831])(ISSN 2817-8831 (Online)](https://portal.issn.org/resource/ISSN/2817-8831) | The longevist | The ISSN Portal). ISSNs provide publications with a global identity, making them recognizable and accessible worldwide. They signal a level of professionalism and will help legitimize The Longevist as a resource alongside all other academic journals.\n* Our Twitter page is already followed by some prominent people in the Longevity field, including David Sinclair, Steve Horvath and The Methuselah Foundation. And our presence caught the attention of the Journal, [Rejuvenation Research](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/rej.2023.0062) who recently highlighted The Longevist as a development in the field.\n\n![img_6](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/7fd3da2045fffa319fc5ba1a78435752bee0ca2a_2_1204x494.png)\n\n* Formed a collaboration with DeSciLabs - all Longevist preprints were put onchain via [DeSciLabs](https://www.desci.com/) Nodes. This provides provenance and permanence for each preprint.\n* In advanced talks with one aging journal to have all Curators’ Choice preprints eligible to go straight to peer-review.\n* Collaborated with the founders of BioRxiv to have Longevist-featured preprints included in their newly introduced “Community Reviews”.\n\n![img_7](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/d6a173407eae4bd83a1ceb63080d4f81bf55ccb4_2_1204x504.png)\n\nIn surveying the Curators after 2023,\n* On average, each curator shared The Longevist with 14 colleagues. Thus, potentially up to 500 more longevity researchers know of VitaDAO now.\n* All of them who responded (16) said they would vote in 2024\n* None of them responded they wouldn’t take less compensation given that VITA price has appreciated.\n\nIn general, the Curators seemed enthusiastic about continuing their participation and in growing awareness for The Longevist and VitaDAO.\n\n## Integration of Longevist longlisted preprints into Dealflow for sourcing new projects\nThe Longevist team generated a longlist of 180+ longevity preprints from 2023. This was created by utilising a social listening tool, database scraping, referral prizes and ear-to-the-ground efforts. Code was created to automatically categorise the preprints by hallmark of ageing, disease indication etc. A CommercializationGPT was created to analyze the preprint content and determine Technology Readiness Level (TRL) to identify ones that have potential for commercialization.\n\nOur “sourcing champions” then identified preprints which they would like to pursue, with ~65 preprints having already been assigned a champion.\n\nThose preprints with commercialization potential will been integrated into dealflow as a top-of-funnel source of topical research.\n\n## 2024 Plans\n### Objective 1: Expand and Develop Curator Network\nKey Results:\n* Increase the number of curators to a minimum of 80 by the end of Q4.\n* Onboard 25% of our existing curators as senior reviewers, and have them review at least 1 project in their domain of expertise by the end of Q4.\n\n### Objective 2: Strengthen Outreach and Engagement\nKey Results:\n* Establish partnerships with at least 3 aging societies, 5 institutes, and 5 universities to promote collaboration and engagement by the end of Q3.\n* Increase Twitter followers to 5000 through targeted content related to aging societies, institutes, and universities by the end of Q4.\n\n### Objective 3: Grow Academic Reader Community & Participation\nKey Results:\n* Achieve an increase in the subscription of readers to our mailing list from 70 to 500 by Q4.\n* In discussions to form a journal club collaboration with [lifespan.io](lifespan.io).\n* In form all longlisted corresponding authors that their work has been selected. Invite the senior authors of Longevist-featured preprints (top 10 of each Q) to be Curators.\n\n### Objective 4: Develop and Distribute Educational Material for the General Public\nKey Results:\n* Collaborate with The Sheekey Science show to launch educational materials tailored for both the general public and academics on the importance and impact of our work.\n* Achieve a reach of 5,000 views/downloads of the educational materials across platforms by the end of Q4.\n\n### Objective 5: Host Annual Longevist Award Ceremony\nKey Results:\n* Successfully plan and execute the inaugural virtual annual award ceremony, recognizing the top Longevity & Aging Research preprints of 2023. To prioritise, following delivery of Q1 '24 (with an aim to host earlier, ~March, in future years).\n* Secure partnerships to increase reach and publicity (see objective 2).\n* Have 100 attendees in the virtual award ceremony.\n\n### Budget\n**2023 Budget awarded**\n* Curator Compensation: 100k VITA maximum allowance (used ~60k VITA)\n* Ops: 25k VITA + 50k USDC\n\n**2024 Budget ask**\n* Curator Compensation: 25k VITA max\n* Ops: 15k VITA + 35k USDC, including running salaries, inaugural annual award ceremony prizes, preprint referral prizes, quarterly Sheekey Science Show content.\n\n## Timeline\n* 2023: Recruit curators, build website and publish first 4 quarterly editions \n* 2024: Grow readership/community and have first longevity-identified projects pass through the dealflow funnel.\n* 2025: Attract donations / sponsorships etc to initiate financial independence from VitaDAO funding.\n\n## Benefits to VitaDAO\n* Reputational value from supporting longevity science.\n* Increased awareness from this value-added outreach project, leading to more funding applications from having more academics and KOLs learn about VitaDAO\n* An increase in critical mass through onboarding KOLs into the VitaDAO ecosystem.\n* Decentralisation of governance to mission-aligned prominent people.\n* New source of dealflow from The Longevist longlist preprint database - potential projects are then pursued by “sourcing champions”",

      "content": "***One-liner*** *: Fission Pharma is developing a protein-protein interaction inhibitor that cuts the link between chronic inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction to treat multiple age-related diseases and extend human lifespan.*\n\n***Revision Notes***:\n\n* *This project was originally proposed as funding an external company with [VDP-123](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-123-assessment-fission-pharma/1450) and rejected.*\n\n* *It was then revised as a VitaDAO company building project worth $250k and proposed as [VDP-143](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-143-funding-fission-pharma-revised/1629) on March 15th 2024, taking into account the feedback received on VDP-123. The Discourse poll had a positive outcome, with 16 votes in favor and 1 vote against*\n* *The current update of the revision, dated April 5th 2024, includes a research plan expansion to be covered with $83 333 co-funding from [Cerebrum DAO](https://www.cerebrumdao.com/) in exchange for a share of the resulting IP-NFT. It is motivated by the opportunity to significantly increase the probability of success at marginal cost as well as the interest of Cerebrum DAO to support this project*\n* *Due to Snapshot’s character number limitation, the current proposal is an abridged version of the [full proposal available on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-143-funding-fission-pharma-revised/1629).*\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG Team\n\n* **Senior reviewers**: the same reviewers as the previous proposal, including two entrepreneurs, an executive, a VC, and a professor, provided a review update.\n\n* **Shepherd**: Paolo Binetti, Ryan Spangler\n* **Squad members**: Eleanor Davies\n* **Sourced by**: Paolo Binetti, Ryan Spangler\n\n## Project Team\n\n* **Principal Investigator:** Luis Rios, PhD\n\n* **VitaDAO Entrepreneur In Residence/Project Manager:** Anthony Schwartz, Ph.D.\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nFission Pharma is creating the first drug-like **small molecule P110 mimetics**. P110 is *a mito-protective peptide* originating from Stanford University [1]. **The efficacy of P110 in treating neurodegenerative and cardiac disease is supported by 13 years of research**, resulting in 20 scientific publications across 11 disease models and collaboration with 15 independent labs globally. P110 has highly generalized anti-degenerative activity, increasing lifespan in mouse models of neurodegeneration (HD [2-5], ALS [5-6], AD [5, 7, 8], PD [1], MS, stroke, and scrapie) and also a model of ischemic heart disease [9]. Dr. Luis Rios published the first small molecule P110 mimetics in 2023 [10] and showed comparable efficacy to P110 in mouse models of ALS and sepsis. These inhibitors have a unique property, they inhibit the downstream pathological consequences of inflammation without inhibiting immune signals. These compounds aim to be the first effective and generalized orally available and brain penetrant treatments for ***chronic inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction***, critical hallmarks of aging, and may do so ***without causing immunosuppression***, the limiting factor in chronic inflammation treatment. The most tractable go-to-market strategy will be in a rare neurodegenerative disease (ALS) and they will expand to age-related degenerative indications such as AD and ischemic heart disease, the **major limiting factors in human lifespan.**\n\n## Problem\n*Please see the [full proposal on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-143-funding-fission-pharma-revised/1629).*\n\n\n## Solution\n\n*Please see the [full proposal on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-143-funding-fission-pharma-revised/1629).*\n\n## Opportunity\n\n*Please see the [full proposal on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-143-funding-fission-pharma-revised/1629).*\n\n## Relevance to Longevity\n\n*Please see the [full proposal on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-143-funding-fission-pharma-revised/1629).*\n\n## IP Roadmap\n\n*Please see the [full proposal on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-143-funding-fission-pharma-revised/1629).*\n\n## Experimental Plan\n\nBelow is the draft plan proposed for this project divided in four phases with go / no go milestone to trigger funding tranches (also shown) for each one of them:\n \n![planning 1.jpg](ipfs://bafkreigfnftfvbvio27tkq3rt26ltwzfriom6v3cd4ixm55invjutpbo5y)\n    \nDecember is considered a contingency buffer in case the project or the funding campaign for the follow-up take longer than expected. \n\nBelow is the draft plan for the follow-up until phase 1 clinical trial (not covered by this project, but provided for visibility into the next steps), including preliminary budget and milestones.:\n \n![planning 2.jpg](ipfs://bafkreiaz73j3osj4ynyjbajk6ranhlvfot5nrdovq62bvio37wzlcxf35e)\n    \n*For more details, please see the [full proposal on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-143-funding-fission-pharma-revised/1629).*\n\n## IP Building Round Budget Breakdown\n\nThe total budget requested for this proposal is $333k, broken down as follows:\n\n \n![budget 1.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeifu3rgzsctngw2kjpowwspna6d4xc6dmyykgikxcyouw6oos73lna)![budget 2.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeibqylfybfakwdzuj7r5fnbvdql3wb74kbnk7vo3dkc35ralibnl6m)\n    \n    \n## Financing and VitaDAO funding terms\n\n**IP Building Round:** This phase focuses on identifying promising leads and filing provisional patents for NCEs (New Chemical Entities). The proposed amount is $333 333, consistent with the budget above, to be funded by:\n\n* VitaDAO for $250 000\n\n*  Cerebrum DAO for $83 333. \n\nThe IP built by the team becomes an IP-NFT, whose ownership is split:\n\n* 60% VitaDAO\n\n* 20% Cerebrum DAO\n* 5% PI, Luis Rios\n* 5% Employee Option Pool\n* 5% EIR, Anthony Schwartz\n* 5% Deal squad\n\n**Pre-Seed Round (not included in this proposal):** If milestones met for phase 1, would proceed to raise approximately $500k community-funded via an IPT mechanism. The objective is to progress from initial hits to lead compounds, positioning Fission for a subsequent seed round. Details would be determined in a future VDP proposal.\n\n## Team\n\n*Please see the [full proposal on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-143-funding-fission-pharma-revised/1629).*\n\n\n## Slide deck\n\n[VitaDAO-Fission Pharma Deck.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PmzqeN1fqNJr6bZnlVY-pNr0ZbYIA0kU/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## Highlights\n\n* **P110** , a proof of concept peptide inhibitor for DRP1-FIS1 interaction, shows efficacy and no toxicity in many age-related disease models. 13 years of research, 11 disease models, and 20 publications on **P110**.\n\n* **The founder has developed SC9** , a P110-mimetic small molecule showing efficacy in vitro and in vivo.\n* These compounds act via a novel mechanism of action and target site.\n* VitaDAO will own composition of matter patents on compounds discovered.\n* Pre-seed program with substantial scientific validation and IP-NFT offer.\n* “Pipeline in a pill” with 3 major classes of compounds targeting different tissues.\n\n## Risks\n\n* Novel mechanism of action that hasn’t been tested in humans (on-target tox)\n\n* Poor models for brain aging (but good models of Huntington’s).\n* Relevance for life extension not tested\n* Competition\n\n## Bibliography\nPlease see the [full proposal on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-143-funding-fission-pharma-revised/1629).*\n\n## Senior Review Digest - Quantitative\nBelow is the average scores out of 5 per category from 5 reviewers, who all recommended that the project should be advanced for token-holders vote.\n\n**Average Scores**\n\n* Team Expertise: 4.4\n\n* Feasibility & Data: 4.2\n* Commercial Potential & Impact: 4.2\n* Novelty & Market Advantage: 4.2\n* IP Defensibility: 4.2\n* Relevance to Longevity: 4.2\n* Deal Terms: 4.8\n* **General Conviction Score 4.2** (for reference, the average score of past funded projects is 3.7)\n\n*Note: while these scores refer to the original version of this proposal (VDP-143), we believe that they are mostly still applicable  to the current revision.*\n\n## Senior Review Digest - Qualitative\nEach reviewer was asked whether they would endorse the project, below are their answers.\n\n**Reviewer 1**\nI would endorse the project because of its applications in several age-related diseases. Nevertheless, VitaDAO should take an active role in tracking the progress of the company and help in reaching the next milestones. With the new updates in company team and focused strategy for drug development convinced me more in a positive way. I have updated my scores and would be happy to endorse the company.\n\n**Reviewer 2**\nYes, I would endorse it. Very feasible. The background science is solid and validated in mice disease models. The question is whether it will work in humans. They focus on a rare disease approach. Looks like a good first step.\n\n**Reviewer 3**\nGiven the new additions to the team, the more straightforward path to IP, and the clear unmet need for ALS, I am more than happy to endorse this project. I am personally excited to see how the science plays out. The science is interesting. There could be applications to Longevity. The ask is reasonable.\n\n**Reviewer 4**\nYes. Despite adding Anthony, this is still a risky project as it uses computational chemistry to screen for a new compound. However the risk/reward is worth it. Good survival data. Market is big for ALS, neurodegenerative diseases, etc. The terms are better now.\n\n**Reviewer 5**\nThe project is in its infancy stage. If the company does not claim its relevance to longevity, I am more than happy to support the project once the team has clinical & commercial experts; if it is related to longevity, I would not support but will actively participate in it until data on longevity related conditions/diseases come out (i.e. premature ovarian failure, dementia, AD, etc.).\n\n*Note: while these endorsements refer to the original version of this proposal (VDP-143, not VDP-123), we believe that they are mostly still applicable  to the current revision.*\n\n## Vote\n\nHere, you, the VITA token holders, are voting to agree or disagree with VitaDAO funding this venture.",

      "title": "VDP-133 - VITA-FAST Genesis contributor allocation proposal ",
      "content": "**TLDR:** This proposal provides Genesis contributor allocations for VitaDAO contributors to VITA-FAST. This is both to reward effort that went into making VITA-FAST possible and also to allow the VitaDAO contributors to continue to contribute to the project by voting with their tokens. A 5% allocation was governed in VDP-100 and approved by Newcastle University. This proposal distributes that 5%.\n\n**Team:** Tim Peterson, Estefano Pinilla, Alex Dobrin\n\n**Background:** Like with the launching of VitaDAO and the $VITA token, the [Korolchuk project](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-16-korolchuk-lab-autophagy-activators-funding-proposal/451/10) and $VITA-FAST was a collective effort by many people over many months and in some cases years. Below is a list of VITA-FAST contributors. The main activities in getting VITA-FAST to launch were sourcing, shepherding, reviewing, awareness, and administrative. Many people did multiple of these activities but their main activity is highlighted.\n\n**Big picture:** Funding projects is key to VitaDAO’s mission, but advancing the funded projects is key to growing the value of VitaDAO. Therefore, for each project having the proper incentives to grow the project is critical. This proposal provides a first example for a project that went from IP-NFT to IPT. Other projects may have different allocations but in general the idea is that the incentives should be modest yet still enough to get people motivated to create the best outcomes for VitaDAO.\n\nA subsequent proposal will outline incentives for future VitaDAO contributors to contribute to VITA-FAST.\n\n**Proposal:** This proposal seeks the approval of the VitaDAO to allocate 3.5% of the total supply of $VITA-FAST tokens to the list of contributors indicated below. The remaining 1.5% of the 5% allocation will be determined by a majority of VitaDAO Stewards to account for contributors not listed here. These tokens can’t be sold from one year passing this proposal and have an additional year vesting (monthly) - 24 months in total. This will be enforced via smart contract. Additionally, some contributors receiving larger allocations will be under the expectation to make a good faith effort to continue to contribute to the project as needed. Those continuing contributors are indicated below.\n\n**Conflict of interest:** These contributors can not vote in favor of their own compensation on this proposal. However, they can vote “abstain” such that the vote reaches quorum.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifkzccdxc5l7mczlmwrx4g5diovhmrndkfyguyvodizsq6jlfs7ve)",

      "title": "VDP-142 Healthspan XPRIZE Plan",
      "content": "## Summary \nThe [XPRIZE Healthspan Competition](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/healthspan) announced an inspiring and bold challenge to make significant progress on longevity by 2030 with a $101 million prize, aiming to rejuvenate immune, cognitive and muscle function in a cohort of 60-85 year olds.  The scope of the competition aligns with VitaDAO’s vision and community-centric approach. \n\nThis proposal comes as a result of a collective decision made by the Dealflow Working Group. It will outline VitaDAO’s approach to winning the XPRIZE funding by 2030. This will involve an in-house XPRIZE squad, adjunct to the Builder Squad that will build a cohort of 5-6 academic and spinout projects towards the longevity combination therapeutic. To do this, VitaDAO will allocate a combination of non-dilutive launchpad funding from its treasury and Intellectual Property Tokens (IPTs) via the [Molecule platform](https://www.molecule.xyz/#ip-nfts).\n\n## VitaDAO's Approach\nIn line with the [2024-2025 Mandate proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.vitadao.eth/proposal/0xbfff4d428c4a3e065350ce70c42a9be453f34c8b649b8aeb65c0c022e625dbe1), the VitaDAO Dealflow Working Group aims to build 5-6 teams to develop a combination of interventions targeting biological aging to improve muscle, cognitive, and immune function in individuals aged 65-80 years.\n\n## Budget & Support\nVitaDAO proposes to finance successful project proposals with total funding of up to $2M equivalent in a combination of fiat and IPTs to support the costs of their participation in the competition, including R&D, general operations and application fees among other costs. This will enable the community to directly contribute funding via the IPT framework to enable direct governance over and support for specific research projects. This compliments the proposed budget in the 2024-2025 Mandate proposal. \n\nBy participating in the XPRIZE through VitaDAO, teams will gain entry into an extensive network, have opportunities for collaboration with other initiatives, and have the possibility to join forces with other teams. They will also receive ongoing support from the Dealflow Working Group and the Builder Squad.\n\nThis runs in line with the Dealflow Working Group and Builder Squad workflow and will **not** require an extra call for resources beyond what is already available in the community. Project proposals that are put forward for the XPRIZE submission will be highlighted in its Discourse VDP and must already comply with [VDP-106](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-106-governance-proposal-eligibility-criteria-to-enter-the-vitadao-deal-flow-funnel/1343). \n\n## Specification\n\n* **Project Leads**: Eleanor Davies, Anthony Schwartz\n\n* **XPRIZE Squad**: Maria Corliano, Michele Gallia, Maria Marinova, Keith Comito, Vincent Weisser\n*Nb: The team may grow or change once this VDP proposal has been implemented*\n* **Description**: Development and testing of a combination therapeutic treatment to reverse age-related decline in muscle, cognitive, and immune function.\n* **Eligibility Criteria**: VitaDAO will conduct an assessment of its existing projects for XPRIZE admission eligibility. New projects will follow VitaDAO’s existing Proposal Eligibility Criteria in [VDP-106](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-106-governance-proposal-eligibility-criteria-to-enter-the-vitadao-deal-flow-funnel/1343), and the admission criteria for the XPRIZE. VitaDAO will enter as a longevity biotech hub-and-spoke model.\n* **Team and idea formation** will start immediately. The team will comprise multidisciplinary skills including subject matter experts, biotechnologists, clinicians, and researchers​​.\n* **XPRIZE Registration Deadline** - November 29, 2023 - June 30, 2024\n  * **Registration requirements:**\n    * Team composition (e.g., number of expected team members)\n    * Proposed solution focus areas (e.g., device, biologic, etc.)\n    * In what areas of technical or subject matter expertise is your team seeking support?\n    * Is your team open to collaboration opportunities?\n* **Applicants can share the draft of their research proposals** already here in the VitaDAO governance forum, and start forming dedicated scientific teams outlining their plan. The plan should be shaped to the following:\n  * **Milestone 1 - Qualifying Submission**: teams must establish necessary preclinical and research and development data guiding the therapeutic treatment. (Includes data and evidence of progress to date, regulatory requirements, and pathway to achieving testing in clinical studies.)\n    * **XPRIZE timeline:** July 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024\n  * **Milestone 2 - Proof of Concept Clinical Studies:** teams must provide clinical trials of up to 60 days data to show the feasibility of the approach, safety and early estimates of effect in two of the primary target areas that suggest the next stage phase II trials are warranted.\n    * **XPRIZE timeline:** March, 2025 - Feb, 2026\n  * **Milestone 3 - Finals Testing:** 1 Year Clinical Studies: teams must demonstrate their therapeutic solution can restore all three factions (muscle, cognitive and immune function) using clinical protocols with detailed information.\n    * **XPRIZE timeline:** 2026 - 2029\n* **Community Voting:**\n  * **Existing projects:** Projects will be chosen case-by-case by the XPRIZE squad with input from the senior review panel including senior scientists, geriatricians and preventive medicine clinicians, regulatory affairs specialists, and clinical trials specialists.\n  * **New funding proposals:** will follow the standard Longevity Dealflow governance process. Proposals will contain information on XPRIZE submission eligibility to be governed by the community.\n* **Qualifying projects:** will be managed by the XPRIZE Squad in collaboration with the Builder Squad.\n\n## Timeline and Implementation\n\n* Internal deadline one month before XPRIZE milestone 1 deadline\n* December deadline relates to pre-clinical concept validation. Outline for prospective teams to have these criteria fulfilled in order to keep to timeline\n* Delegation of prize money to be decided further down the line\n* VitaDAO will operate as a longevity biotech hub-and-spoke model and will enter the XPRIZE as such.\n\n## Call for ideas\nTogether with the Longevity Prize, an incentivized challenge “Healthspan Hypothesis Prize” will be created to put forward concrete proposals for research and study designs, that propose clear steps on how to maximise the likelihood of rejuvenating immune, cognitive and muscle function. This will be a $15K USD prize.\n\n## Bibliography and Resources\n\n* [Healthspan XPRIZE](https://www.xprize.org/prizes/healthspan/guidelines)\n* [Detailed Competition Guidelines ](https://assets-us-01.kc-usercontent.com/5cb25086-82d2-4c89-94f0-8450813a0fd3/15509c25-6198-4104-b7e3-3f6528e7d43a/XPRIZE%20Healthspan%20Preliminary%20Competition%20Guidelines_V1.0.pdf)\n* Visual XPRIZE Timeline:\n**![|602x303](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/1e33a854e0e5581fc8c11ec17b1b5215402acc07.jpeg)**",

      "title": "VitaDAO 2024-2025 Mandate proposal",
      "content": "One-liner: VitaDAO's new mandate prioritizes tokenized asset efforts, aims to create up to 10 IPTs, and fosters community growth, all within a $2.5m budget by 2025.\n\n#### Team: Alex Dobrin, Paul Kohlhaas, Todd White, Tyler Golato, Laurence Ion, Vincent Weisser\n\n# 2025 Escape Velocity.\n\n# ![|624x200](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/196282aca2e158c0a624730776701fd223388e4f.png)\n\nSince VitaDAOs inception, we have helped pioneer the decentralized science movement, catalyzed a global community, and funded research in a diverse set of areas in laboratories, in leading biotech startups, and individuals to become the change they wish to see in their lifetime.\n\nAfter 3 years, we feel there are sufficient data points and the necessity for the DAO to narrow down on a few core activities for 2024 and 2025 to achieve escape velocity. In this proposal, we lay out a new mandate for the activities we propose the DAO dedicate its core resources to. We propose focus and discipline as we prepare for escape velocity.\n\n# Achieving this Mission is accomplished through the following mandate:\n\nMake VitaDAO research funding efforts sustainable by leveraging tokenization. This evergreen R&D strategy entails VitaDAO identifying and funding commercially viable early-stage longevity projects, tokenizing them, and reclaiming the principal investment through trading fees, liquidity provision, and token appreciation while maintaining large positions in the assets. wThus, a relatively small pool of funding can be used to fund many projects, overcoming the single biggest barrier to longevity biotech.\n\nVitaDAO funded Viktor Korolchuk and NewCastle University in late 2021 with $285k, and the research is still ongoing. In June 2023, VitaDAO launched the first intellectual property token (IPT) pool offering governance to the VitaDAO community. The market stabilized at a valuation of $1.5m and then sharply rose to $14m.\n\n$VITA-FAST in VitaDAOs multisig is valued at $3.6m. Over 6 months, the DAO generated over $130,000 in trading fees and liquidity provision, recouping 50% of its principal in cash and a return exceeding 13x in 18 months.\n\nThree lead compound families have been identified, generating 2x more autophagy events than [Rapamy](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=c3f7936c6fd1a8dc&q=Rapymicin.&nfpr=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjj-4qE7I-EAxVdX_EDHQT4A7kQvgUoAXoECAkQAw)cin at standard doses. If successful, these compounds could become unique novel longevity therapeutics with VitaDAO holding the exclusive IP rights. We are exploring what a DAO-native commercialisation pathway could look like. Taking a step further, we want to enable VitaDAO to become a place of DAO-native research proposals. VitaDAO encompasses an incredibly strong research community - let’s put it to use.\n\nWe believe the numbers, and potential impact here speak for themselves. This could be an entirely new model of sustainable biotech financing. Resources should be fully prioritized to accelerate this model rather than diverting attention across a myriad of activities.\n\nThis model is supplemented by targeted efforts in:\n\n1. Grow longevity network state efforts through partnerships with Vitalia hosting longevity focused gatherings for 1000s of people.\n\n2. Offer the best longevity services, treatments, and products to VitaDAO members through the Membership Portal, ensuring that it is as easy, simple, and time-efficient as possible to optimize member longevity.\n\n3. Conduct a first decentralized trial by leveraging the power of the VitaDAO community.\n\n4. Make VitaDAO a top 100 crypto community through increased crypto awareness and token utility. This will enable the liquidity to make everything else possible.\n\n# Goals\n\n* Direct over $10m into earliest stage longevity research through DeSci tokenisation efforts\n* Create 10 IPTs generating a minimum $2m in cashflow to the DAO.\n* Generate over $1m in revenue through the membership portal\n* Bring VitaDAO into the top 100 crypto communities by size\n* Grow the treasury by $15m\n\n![|624x285](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/967eab8c55280bcbdea0111ac7f5b6999d1588ca.png)\n\nTimeline: Jan 2024 - Jan 2026\n\nBudget: $2.5m\n\n## Review process\n\nIf this new mandate is accepted then a further proposal will be submitted to the community for approval with clear outcomes and metrics, an organizational design to achieve that mandate, followed by a new compensation plan and budget.\n\nAfter the proposal is accepted, VitaDAO will propose a 2024 budget for approval, to optimize for funding research with a low burn rate and very clear accountable metrics that recipients of VitaDAO resources are held accountable to. As such, this proposal will override all resource allocations from previous proposals.",

When examining compensation policy and principles we primarily focused our analysis on asking the following questions:\n\n1. Do VitaDAO’s Compensation Principles make sense broadly speaking?\n2. Are VitaDAO’s Compensation Principles being adhered to in practice?\n3. Are there any organizational changes which would improve VitaDAO’s operations and compensation transparency?\n4. Are there any tokenomics changes which would improve VitaDAO’s operations and compensation transparency?\n5. Before finalizing our report with a series of basic recommendations for VitaDAO to implement in order to streamline and optimize its compensation schema moving forward.\n\nThis report summarizes the findings of the Compensation Policy Squad, and our recommendations for VitaDAO’s Compensation Policy in 2024.\n\nPlease visit the following link to access the entire report: [Compensation Policy Squad Vita DAO Compensation Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aAY4K75xH6K5PnckXpvOPp8VFgMSMk8Y_VZkR_LtLro/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# Implementation\n\nUpon successful passing of this proposal, the Coordination Working Group will update VDP-72 to reflect the changes suggested and provide an updated Compensation Policy document to the community.\n\nSuggested changes will be applied to all current and future contributors and squad/working group positions immediately upon approval.\n\nEDIT: As requested I am putting here in plain language a simple explanation of changes to Stewards compensation.\n\n$VITA compensation per Stewards is **reduced** by ~59% from VDP-72, from 25k $VITA monthly to 10,047 $VITA monthly.\n$USDC compensation **limits** for Stewards are **increased** by ~36% from 8.8K $USDC monthly to 12k $USDC monthly.\nPlease note that Stewards are under both 4y vesting schedules and previously signed contracts which prevent them from selling significant amounts of $VITA before 2026. Please also note the $USDC raise was for the **limit** of Stewards compensation, not actual Stewards compensation which should be set by a separate governance vote.",

      "content": "**One liner:** Theranautilus is developing dental stem cells with internalised magnetic bioglass nanobots for remote-controlled targeted bone growth to tackle bone loss, fracture and root canal failure.\n\n![Image 1](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/f2eedb6ae1e8e9aa3b07e3c61fafa60753604a96.png)\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG team\n**Shepherd:** Rhys Anderson\n**Other squad members:** Tovah Wolf, Divya Cohen, Eleanor Davies\n\n## Simple Summary\nBone loss and tooth fracture are common in geriatric patients (osteoporosis/osteopenia affect around 18% of the global population). It can lead to complications if untreated. Theranautilus is a lab spin-off working to commercialize biohybrid stem cells with internalized magnetic nanobots, to allow for remote control of the stem cells inside a living body to direct them to a target location. Coating the nanobots with calcium silicate bioglass induces an osteogenic phenotype in the stem cells, allowing for targeted bone formation.\n\nThe final product will be cryopreserved biohybrid stem cells to enable easy shipment and easy storage at the hospital level along with the control device to manoeuver them.\n\nThe biohybrid nanobot technology can be applied to root canal failure. The nanobots can be remotely guided through dentine tubules to penetrate deep into the dentine to the site of bacterial infection. Magnetic fields can be applied inducing hyperthermia death. Long term, the technology can be used to target delivery of stem cells for regenerative therapy for age-related conditions e.g. skeletal bone regeneration for osteoporosis/osteopenia, hearing loss and neural regeneration in stroke patients. Teeth are ideal to test this new therapy, including the availability/accessibility of stem cells in dental pulp.\n\n## Problem\nTreatment options for dental bone loss and fracture are inefficient and have high failure rates, excessive treatment times, and schedule delays. Root canal treatment failure is common, occuring in ~10% of cases (up to 5M per year in the US alone). The main cause of endodontic failure is the persistence of microorganisms that cause an intra- or extraradicular infection and become resistant to disinfection measures.\n\n## Opportunity\nThe Theranautilus team has been working on nanorobotics for over a decade. The team is building stem cells that can be magnetically manoeuvred to the target site due to the presence of magnetic nanostructures inside the cells. These nanostructures (CALBOTs) are coated with calcium silicate bioglass to induce an osteogenic phenotype and trigger bone growth. Stem cells are already used in many therapeutic applications and hold potential in regenerative medicine. \n\n![Image 2](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/e87961fb7e2803bea651a4c6a745f92ec1352bf4.png)\n\nTheranautilus are seeking funding to translate their proof-of-concept (PoC) by generating data over a larger sample and undergoing GLP documentation for biohybrid stem cell production.\n\nThey have successfully developed the first working prototype: **THERADRIVE**, a miniature coil suitable for use in an adult human jaw. This is a medical device that can generate up to 60 Gauss rotating fields in any direction to drive stem cells inside the teeth.\n\n![Image 3](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/b8e050b0a48b0d3911224f92b910c146fca60ae1.jpeg)\n*Theradrive prototype*\n\n**Cell toxicity tests**\nThe team has cell toxicity data and know the exact concentration to make the dental stem cells bioactive to trigger bone growth whilst keeping them viable for over a month. This has been validated on mouse preosteoblasts (MC3T3 E1 subclone 4 mouse calvarial pre-osteoblasts (ATCC, USA) ).\n\n**Bone growth tests**\nAfter establishing cell cytotoxicity and confirming the magnetic bioglass is not cytotoxic, they established the bone growth potential of their nanomaterials.\n![Image 4](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/00e673a0412ccce5641ed4c86d46eca6abb8a07b_2_1204x570.jpeg)\n\n*Representative images of bone growth localized to the regions where CALBOTS are present*\n\n**Workflow**\nDental Pulp Stem Cells (DPSCs) will be extracted from wisdom teeth and chilled in HBSS for up to 12 hours. The laboratory will perform quality control on the DPSCs followed by cryopreservation. When required for therapy, the cells will be thawed and expanded, incubated with CALBOTs, before returning to the patient.\n![Image 5](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/e92e0f7415c41c166dcdb6fbd0480146a636e1e6.jpeg)\n*Theranautilus workflow*\n\nFor root canal failure, the nanobots can be guided down the dentinal tubules, followed by application of rapidly varying magnetic fields to heat the nanobots and cause hyperthermia-induced death in bacteria. The team has optimised the procedure for root canal in a rat, including miniaturisation of root canal instruments to custom fit the rat’s oral cavity. Successful root canal procedures have been performed on the rats and a protocol has been developed for upcoming randomized controlled trials with a research hospital.\n\n**Estimated treatment cost analysis (in USD)**\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidqomhlvay4hssn5ky2xme5r33g6b4kpqf7omncc7caviglzr5imm)\n*Refer to [VDP on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-92-theranautilus-magnetically-manoeuvrable-biohybrid-stem-cells/1218) for references and cost analysis breakdown*\n\n**Current Cost of stem cell banking:**\na) Initial Processing : $500 - $2,000\nb) Annual Maintenance (Recurring): $99 - $264\n\n*Breakdown of estimated cost for modifying stem cells:*\na) Materials cost (consumables – One time cost per patient): $50 - $100\nb) Service Charge (Optional; In case Theranautilus provides lab support; cost per patient): $20\n\n## Experimental plan and budget\n\n**Pre-Clinical Studies 1a: Toxicity assays of magnetic bioglass on mesenchymal human stem cells (MSCs).**\n\nTo perfect the protocol of incubating MSCs with magnetic bioglass and the optimum concentration of magnetic bioglass to be used. Cell viability assays at different day points – days 1, 4, and 7. Similar experimental data has been done on mouse pre-osteoblasts, and the same protocol will be followed with necessary adjustments.\n- Required Funding: $31,210\n- Duration: 3 Months\n\n**Pre-Clinical Studies 2a: Efficacy of magnetic bioglass in triggering bone growth in mesenchymal human stem cells.**\nTo test if bone growth is happening with spatial control, by demonstrating the magnetic manoeuvrability of stem cells to target bone fracture and the possibility of patterned bone growth.\n- Required Funding: $71,465\n- Duration: 6 Months\n\n**Pre-Clinical Studies 1b:  GLP certification for magnetic bioglass fabrication.**\nThis is the next step before applying for clinical trials. The magnetic bioglass synthesized by Theranautilus’ protocol will undergo GLP certification before human trials, where the team plans to collaborate closely with a GLP certified lab to provide this certification.\n- Required Funding: $38,150\n- Duration: 6 Months\n\n**Pre-Clinical Studies 2b: Device design to deliver mesenchymal stem cells in the human teeth.**\nThe device is protected by the patent application (https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220226073A1/en). The team will look at making minor modifications to their current control algorithm and machine to work with CBCT or x-ray data to drive magnetic maneuverable stem cells to the fracture site. An image processing component may be added to the device to make it more efficient.\n- Required Funding: $43,000\n- Duration: 6 months\n\nTotal budget: $183,825\n\n## VitaDAO Funding Terms\n$183,000 (USD) via [Sponsored Development Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vdbunTDNuyrVQcGx6jXKwM9qeHMFUdIO/edit) for 15.25% of the Net Company Receipts (valued at $1.2M based on equity raise), encompassing the following for CALBOTs therapies: bone loss, tooth fracture, root canal failure. This would be brought on-chain as an IP-NFT.\n\n## IP Roadmap\nTheranautilus owns the IP to manufacture the devices to control their nanostructures in human teeth. They filed the composition of matter patent in 2022 and will file a PCT for protection in US/EU. The patent protecting the method of creating biohybrid stem cells will be filed once the bone growth data and toxicity experiments are repeated.\n![image](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/5cbaf842d90fe6a94aac3b50cf07f42da37af792.png)\n\n## Team\n**Dr. Debayan Dasgupta - Co-founder, Director**\n**Dr. Shanmukh Srinivas - Co-founder, Director**\n**Prof. Ambarish Ghosh - Co-founder, Director**\n*Full profiles on Discourse*\n\n## Strengths\n- The team are pioneers in implementing magnetic manoeuvrability of nanostructures in biological systems\n- Current medical procedures cannot reach the required depths to kill bacteria.

      "title": "VDP-140 - Tokenization of the ArtanBio IP-NFT",
      "content": "*TLDR; VitaDAO will tokenize the ArtanBIO IP-NFT with a goal of raising $300,000 for research advancement. In exchange, the community will be granted voting power to govern the IP, and participate in R&D decision-making and capital allocation*\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to assess community interest in tokenizing the “Mutation-Specific Codon Suppression for Aging and Longevity” IP-NFT, which provides funding to ArtanBio - one of VitaDAO’s two spinout companies of 2023.\n\n## Background\n\nAs part of VitaDAO’s mission to help build communities around promising longevity research and therapeutics, the VitaDAO community is being offered an opportunity to further support the work of ArtanBio through participation in the crowdsale of IP Tokens raising $300,000 USD in support of the project.\n\nThis is the second IP Token offering, after the [Korolchuk Lab](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-100-fractionalization-of-newcastle-korolchuk-ip-nft/1285), for VitaDAO and represents one of the many interesting scenarios for IP tokenization - in this case, the offering supports research through an existing corporate entity, as compared to an academic project, for which further funding is required to advance the research.\n\nArtan Bio has proposed a novel approach to address genetic and age-related diseases caused by nonsense mutations. These mutations lead to premature protein translation stops, resulting in incomplete and nonfunctional proteins. The solution involves an engineered suppressor system that specifically recognizes these codons and restores normal protein translation. This technology, delivered through clinically validated modalities, shows promising preliminary results and offers various clinical opportunities.\n\nVitaDAO’s initial support for Artan Bio, via a Sponsored Research Agreement (SRA), has been to fund the design and validation of their engineered suppressor system ([VDP-103](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.vitadao.eth/proposal/0x45e635e46ff6a010122c9c6cc406efe1694c2cceec0a239ffe95128a0f3f85b3)) in cells with targetable mutations to confirm validity of the approach.\n\nArtan Bio seeks to continue development of the engineered suppressor system beyond the initial project with VitaDAO to further the IP development, and further validate the system in animal models to support preclinical translation and establish a development candidate for use in clinical trials.\n\n## Specification\n\nIn June 2023, the EU brought into force Markets in Crypto-assets (MiCA) regulation (EU) 2023/1114 and amending Regulations (EU) No 1093/2010 and (EU) No 1095/2010 and Directives 2013/36/EU and (EU) 2019/1937.\n\nEffective June 2024, all crypto-assets and crypto projects must be compliant with these regulations.\n\nFrom July through September 2023, the Coordination Working Group has been assessing the implications around issuing IPTs within the framework of MiCA in anticipation of its implementation in June 2024, and the further development of the IP-NFT and IPT technology stacks and products by Molecule AG.\n\nTo that end, the issuance of IPTs for ArtanBio will be conducted in compliance with [MiCA Title II: Crypto-assets other than Asset-Referenced Tokens or E-money Tokens](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32023R1114#d1e2023-40-1). .\n\nThe draft Whitepaper for the IPT crowdsale, can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1L39FEWw777lFpGvDEb1HOjFzupCq1duw/view?usp=sharing).\n\nPer the Whitepaper above, the issue of IP Tokens (5 000 000 VITARNA tokens to be minted) contemplated in this proposal will result in 20% of the IP Tokens (1 000 000 VITARNA tokens) being issued to up to 499 current VitaDAO tokenholders, and distributing the remaining 80% of the IP Tokens according to the proportions approved in VDP-103 resulting in a distribution as shown below.\n\n![|602x341](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/ae5eb4f7a7349051ea233c0b6b3becdd0536d552_2_1204x682.jpeg)\n\n# Implementation\n\nUpon approval of this proposal, the Coordination Working Group will be empowered to mint IPTs for the ArtanBio IP-NFT using the [Molecule Marketplace](https://discover.molecule.to/) and implement the offering in accordance with the Whitepaper and the required legal review and regulatory requirements.\n\n# Budget\n\nThe temporary use of 21,000 USDC as part of preparing for the IPT crowdsale. This will be reimbursed to VitaDAO from the proceeds of the crowdsale between 90-120 days after the close of the offering.",

      "content": "**One-liner:** Builder Squad proposal for phasing out VitaDAO funded academic projects and spinouts.\n\n## Builder Squad Team\nAnthony Schwartz, Eleanor Davies, Eli Mohamad\n\n## Simple Summary\nVitaDAO will have evaluated more than 200 projects by December 2023. Out of those, 22 were funded, of which there are 7 academic projects and spinouts. These entities are managed by the VitaDAO Builder Squad. \n\nThe project evaluation and project management processes are well established, and have been voted in [through DAO governance](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.vitadao.eth/proposal/0xdd47c1d2e20003559ba94ecbe5edd4322b943eced9c6c82946cebf450755254a), entrusting the Builder Squad with some of the most commercially promising ones. The purpose of this proposal is to define the protocol for projects where it has been established the DAO wishes to discontinue support and/or funding.\n\n## Problem\nVitaDAO is committed to funding and building projects with the potential for commercial viability. As the DAO has matured, so have its projects. Most projects are funded in milestones, with each milestone requiring a review of progress and data by the Builder Squad. Further financing is approved following a positive review. \n\nIn the natural course of scientific research and development, some projects will present negative data, therefore triggering a negative review. These projects will need to be phased out as soon as possible to preserve VitaDAO’s treasury.\n\nThe VitaDAO Builder Squad therefore, requires a standard operating procedure (SOP) to phase out projects in an efficient way, preserving the relationships with the researchers and academic institutions involved. \n\nAs per the current Builder Squad process, the following stakeholders are involved in the management of a funded academic project or spinout: \n\n**The Project Investigator (PI)**\nThe PI is the representative of the team of researchers implementing the project, which in most of our projects is extramural. \n\n**Builder Squad**\nThis is a small team of Builder Squad members assisting the Project Lead in managing the project. It includes other Builders, the Project Lead, as well as the Squad Lead. \n\n**Project Lead (PL)**\nThe PL is the single individual within VitaDAO responsible for the project outcomes. This individual serves as the first point of contact for the researcher, and represents VitaDAO. The PL reports directly to VitaCORE. \n\n**Builder Squad Lead (SL)**\nThe Builder Squad Lead is the senior individual involved in coordinating and assisting all projects the Squad is tasked with managing. \n\n**Scientific Advisory Board (SAB)**\nVitaDAO’s scientific board of experts in aging research, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, financing and regulation. \n\n## Solution\nThe following process is currently implemented:\n\n1. The PL and Builder Squad review the project reports and updates once a milestone and/or when an anticipated project phase completion date has occurred, as per the project proposal.\n2. Using data provided by the PI, published literature and expert reviews, the team will make an internal decision whether the PI has met its milestone(s) to support additional funding.\n3. If the PL determines the milestones have been met, the next tranche of funding will be unlocked\n\nIf the project reaches a no-go inflection point (i.e. has generated negative data, has not met its milestones), the Builder Squad proposes the following:\n\n1. The PL will meet with the PI to discuss ways to amend the project path, and possibly move the project forward.\n2. The PI will be asked to write a project continuation proposal, which will be shared with the Builder Squad.\n3. The Builder Squad will review the proposal and the PL will determine if the newly amended path will suffice to move the project forward.\n\nIf the project continuation proposal is insufficient, the Builder Squad proposes the following:\n\n1. The PL will document their position with the PI in a phase-out proposal, using the dataset, scientific arguments and explanations for each milestone that is believed not to have been met.  \n2. The project phase-out proposal, dataset, and the PI’s continuation proposal will be sent to 3-5 Senior Reviewers that have expertise in the scientific and commercial aspects of the project.\n3. The PL will present the materials to VitaCore and the SAB \n4. If VitaCore and the SAB agree with the project phase-out proposal, funding will be phased out.\n5. If VitaCore and the SAB determine project milestones have been met, the PL will approve the continuation of financing for the project as per the original project proposal.\n6. If VitaCore and the SAB  decide that project milestones have not been met, but the project continuation proposal is sufficient to amend the project path and achieve the initially proposed milestones, the Builder Squad will work with the PI to create a project amendment without any original budget changes, to be presented to VitaCORE and the SAB.",

      "content": "One-liner: Development of multi-inflammasome inhibitors as a potential treatment for age-related diseases.\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG team\n\n* Senior Reviewers: Review requested\n* Shepherd: Maria Marinova\n* Other squad members: Eleanor Davies, Estefano Pinilla, Abhijit Kale, Ryan Spangler, Cassy Le, Adrian Matysek\n* Sourced by: Maria Marinova\n\n## Project PI\n\nMario D. Cordero, PhD\n\nPrincipal Investigator\n\nDepartment of Molecular Biology and Biochemical Engineering, Universidad Pablo de Olavide, Seville, Spain\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nInflammasomes are multiprotein complexes recruited and assembled upon exposure to pathogenic microbes and host danger signals, initiating the inflammatory response and activating caspase-1. However, they are also involved in the development of inflammatory disorders and the onset of age-related diseases, such as metabolic or neurodegenerative conditions.\n\nThe Principal Investigator, Mario D. Cordero, PhD, and his team showed in their preliminary results that different inflammasomes interact in the early stages of the inflammatory response, setting the hypothesis that the formation of heterocomplexes of inflammasomes is a key regulatory pathway for for pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1β and IL-18.\n\nThe team will explore the molecular links between the signaling mechanisms of inflammasomes to form regulatory heterocomplexes throughout the lifetime. They will address the formation of a coordinated macromolecular self-regulatory network and its malfunction in age-associated phenotypes and during cellular senescence as a physiological source of age-associated damage. Lastly, Cordero and his team will generate an innovative set of potential therapeutic candidates that will lay the basis for novel, long-lasting effective treatments for age-related diseases.\n\nProblem\n\nAging is a natural process for all living organisms based on a progressive impairment of the physiological homeostasis at the cellular, tissue, and organismal level. The biological hallmarks of aging include inflammation. “Inflammaging” refers to the progressive accumulation of pro-inflammatory mediators during biological aging creating a low- grade sterile chronic inflammation environment. Among these mediators, IL-1β and IL-18 have been extensively studied and are directly related with the formation and activation of the inflammasomes.\n\nInflammasomes are multiprotein complexes responsible for the regulation of caspase-1 activation and the induction of inflammation in response to infectious microbes and host danger signals. However, inflammasomes activation in microglial cells and macrophages is associated with aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nIt is therefore paramount to not only understand the physiological function of inflammasomes, but to also explore ways to regulate it in order to develop short and long-term personalized treatments.\n\n## Opportunity\n\nThe primary objective is the development of therapeutics for age-related diseases through an in-depth study of inflammasomes, crucial agents in immunity and inflammation. To achieve this goal, the present project aims to study how the inflammasomes form heterocomplexes taking advantage of similar domains to participate in the aging process to trigger age-related diseases, and acting as sensors of danger signals associated to aging.\n\nThe investigator propose to reach these goals by using a multi-disciplinary approach including cell culture, molecular biology, structural biology, biophysics and animal models to specifically address the following objectives:\n\nWP1.- Characterization of the heterocomplexes involved in life and aging.\n\nWP2.- Mechanism of interaction of the inflammasome to participate in the formation of heterocomplex structures.\n\nWP3.- Design of novel pharmacological approaches to modulate superinflammasomes activity.\n\nThe research fills a critical gap in the current market, as there is a lack of comprehensive solutions targeting the complexities of inflammaging.\n\nOther research predominantly focus on the development of inhibitors targeting individual inflammasomes. However, this approach often overlooks the compensatory mechanisms that can arise, diminishing long-term efficacy. With this project, the team is introducing a novel therapeutic target that can prevent age-related diseases by pioneering a new approach in the management of inflammaging.\n\n## Experimental plan and budget\n\nResearch Plan\n\nObjective 1. Characterization of the inflammasomes macro-complexes involved in life and aging.\n\nThe investigator’s preliminary data showed an activation of NLRP1 and NLRP3 in an irradiated cellular model of senescence and animal model of accelerated aging (Figure 1). And other inflammasomes have been shown to be activated during aging such as NLRC4 or AIM-2. All this data opens the door to the involvement of multiple inflammasomes in various stages of aging and senescence with interaction between them.\n\n![|602x436](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/c64c3de1255d1eec675c0dc0ac99092a2bb888d7_2_602x181.png)\n\nFigure 1. Inflammasomes expression during aging and senescence\n\nObjective 2. Human validation of the inflammasome heterocomplexes\n\nIn numerous human diseases where the inflammasome has been studied, multiple papers provide evidence of various activated inflammasomes. Consequently, several cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurodegenerative diseases have demonstrated elevated levels of NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, or AIM2 inflammasome complexes. The investigator and his team aim to validate findings from other objectives using human samples obtained from diverse diseases.\n\nObjective 3. Design of novel pharmacological approaches to modulate heterocomplexes\n\nThe investigator will use the structural data available on the different individual inflammasomes to perform a rational-driven search for novel modulators of heterocomplexes.\n\nThe compound will also be evaluated in vivo models of aged mice, accelerated aging model (progeroid mice) and a gain of function NLRP3 mutant associated with neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) in mice. The investigator will analyse survival (Kaplan–Meier survival curves) bodyweight, food and water consumption, cardiometabolic profile (electrocardiographic examination, glucose tolerance and insulin response, Leptin, adiponectin and serum biomarkers) and inflammatory profile (Cytokine Array / Chemokine Array 42-Plex with IL-18 (HD42)), histological of liver, heart, kidney, lung, muscle, ovary and skin from male and female mice.\n\n—----\n\nMoreover, Cordero’s laboratory has developed a compound with the potential to inhibit both NLRP1 and NLRP3, which are two major inflammasomes involved in distinct inflammatory pathways. Simultaneously targeting both could offer a broader spectrum of action, impacting various inflammatory conditions or diseases. Preliminary data indicate that NEK7 is an essential protein in the activation of both NLRP1 and NLRP3 (Figure 2). Cordero’s initial compound, C3, demonstrates significant effects in inhibiting the interaction of NEK7 with NLRP1 and NLRP3.\n\n![|602x436](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/056fb5f96e5acb442ce411aa2e80a1f93d5ee593_2_602x436.jpeg)\n\nFigure 2.

Discussion ongoing.\n\n## Relevance to longevity\n\nThis project is highly relevant to longevity due to its focus on inflammasomes, which are multiprotein complexes involved in both the inflammatory response and the onset of age-related diseases like metabolic and neurodegenerative conditions. The Principal Investigator, Mario D. Cordero, and his team aim to explore how different inflammasomes interact in early inflammatory stages and hypothesize that their formation into heterocomplexes is a crucial regulatory pathway for these proteins.\n\nUnderstanding these molecular links and the formation of regulatory heterocomplexes throughout a lifespan could uncover insights into age-related damage and cellular senescence. By investigating the malfunction of these complexes in age-associated phenotypes, the team hopes to generate potential therapeutic candidates for treating age-related diseases more effectively.\n\n## Team\n\nDr. Mario D. Cordero, Principal Investigator\n\nDr. Antonio Astorza, Postdoctoral Researcher\n\nDr. Juan Miguel Suarez, Postdoctoral Researcher\n\nInés Muela, Predoctoral Student\n\nJuan A. Pedregal, Agent of the Intellectual Property office of the Universidad Pablo de Olvide\n\n## Strengths\n\nInnovative Approach: The focus on studying inflammasome heterocomplexes during aging is innovative, offering a unique perspective on the inflammatory processes associated with aging.\n\nPreliminary Compound Development: Having a family of compounds with inhibitory potential against a heterocomplex formed by NLRP1/NLRP3 provides a strong starting point for drug development.\n\nExperienced Research Team: The expertise of the Principal Investigator and his team, backed by previous research demonstrating the roles of inflammasomes in various aspects of aging, serves as a strong foundation for this project.\n\n## Risks\n\nComplexity of Inflammasome Interactions: Understanding the interactions between different inflammasomes can be highly complex. Validating specific heterocomplexes associated with aging and diseases might face challenges due to the intricate nature of these molecular interactions.\n\nTranslation to Therapeutics: While the preliminary compounds show promise, translating them into effective therapeutics for human use might face hurdles such as toxicity, off-target effects, or limited efficacy in vivo.\n\nLong-Term Effects and Safety: Given that treatments for age-related diseases might require long-term administration, ensuring the safety and efficacy of inhibitors over extended periods, especially in aging populations, could pose challenges.",

      "content": "**TLDR:** This proposal is to authorize VitaDAO to pay the remaining $250K for phase II of [VDP-5](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-5-scheibye-knudsen-lab-funding-proposal/188), The Longevity Molecule, led by Morten Scheibye-Knudsen (MSK) from the University of Copenhagen\n\n## Background: \nThe Longevity Molecule is a project in two phases, whose funding was approved on chain by the VitaDAO community via the [VDP-5](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-5-scheibye-knudsen-lab-funding-proposal/188) proposal, which stipulated that:\n\n* Phase I, worth $250k would be funded\n* Phase II, worth $250k would require a new proposal (the current one)\n\nTo implement the project, a contract was signed with the University of Copenhagen. As this agreement was initiated in the early stages of VitaDAO, this was undertaken on behalf of VitaDAO by Molecule’s legal team. Additionally, the contract did not contain a clause conditioning the funding of phase II to approval by the VitaDAO community.\n\nThe project then started and phase I (primarily cell assays) was successfully completed. Not requiring a contractual approval to go on, MSK engaged phase II (primarily animal model assays) producing a lead asset earlier than expected.\n\nThis proposal is the revision of a [previous version](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-125-proposal-to-advance-scheibye-knudsen-lab-ip-nft-asset/1475/11), which did not pass Discourse governance, based on the feedback received.\n\n## Rationale\n1. The project has yielded exactly what it set out to achieve - a potential lead asset - and we want to continue a productive working relationship with MSK and Copenhagen to advance it. As part of that, MSK has kindly agreed to continue working on the project to add to the IP position at no additional cost. This may lead to an inflection point enabling funding for subsequent phases, including preclinical and clinical work via an IPT crowdsale.\n\n2. VitaDAO is obligated to pay for phase II according to how the contract was written. Not paying them would damage VitaDAO’s reputation.\n\n## Corrective actions for future projects\nVitaDAO is an entirely new model of funding biotech ventures. Going from zero to one does imply mistakes are made, but once recognized, corrective actions need to be taken. The outcome of our lessons-learned for this specific case are the following:\n\n* VitaDAO commits to implement a systematic contract review process, where coherency with on-chain decision is verified\n* VitaDAO commits to implement a systematic project management process. This is already partially implemented via the [Portfolio Management Process](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-102-governance-portfolio-management-process/1312), which was recently deployed, and via the Builder Squad, focused on company building projects, which was recently tested and is [under review](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.vitadao.eth/proposal/0xdd47c1d2e20003559ba94ecbe5edd4322b943eced9c6c82946cebf450755254a)\n* Subsequent to community approval on 16th June 2023 VDP-101, VitaDAO has incorporated its own entity, VitaDAO Global Services. This entity acts as VitaDAO’s agent for an on behalf of VitaDAO, included but not limited to finance, communications and service provider management functions\n\n## Other actions\nVitaDAO and Molecule are considering the opportunity of selling 25% of VitaDAO’s MSK IP-NFT to Molecule at cost, with the following mutual benefits:\n\n* VitaDAO will free up cash to increase runway and fund more academic projects, improving its portfolio diversification, reducing the amount needed from upcoming raises\n* Molecule recognizes the potential of MSK IP-NFT, in particular towards its fractionalization\n\nThis decision on Molecule’s participation will be addressed more in detail in a subsequent proposal. Please vote below to approve or deny VitaDAO paying the remaining funding to the University of Copenhagen.",

Confirm or assign an internal project lead to each of our spinouts with a formal mission letter setting clear goals for each project lead before he/she starts the work\n\n2. Project leads will preferably have experience in biotech company building, in particular therapeutics. A single person can be assigned to more than one project, as is the case with Matrix Bio, Jonathan An, Evandro Fang and so on.\n\n3. Each project lead is accountable for the execution of the research plan by the PI and/or the project research team (which can be internal, as in the case of ARTAN, or external, as in the case of ApoptoSENS, or a mix) and of the continuation of the project, until VitaDAO has skin in the game.\n\n4. Builder Squad will be merged with the Dealflow Working Group. This will enable broader access to talent and resources from the community.\n\n5. The builder squad is the community of project leads. The squad will be shepherded by an experienced biotech builder. Officially, the project leads will report directly to VitaCORE.\n\n6. Day-to-day management of projects is the responsibility of the project leads, who can consult the builder squad lead, members of the dealflow working group (including the 3+ VitaCore members already in the group), and senior reviewers for advice, and who shall escalate major decisions to VitaCORE.\n\n7. During quarterly reviews, projects will present progress to VitaCore and lean on SAB for expert-led advice\n\n8. Each project shall comply with the portfolio management process, including quarterly project reviews, as a formal checkpoint on project progress, in terms of results, planning, and cost\n\n9. Projects requiring more frequent supervision may be required to also report their progress on a bi-weekly basis at a company building routine, animated by one of the project leads and/or the Dealflow Working Group point of contact.\n\n10. The objective of the builder squad is solely to advance our portfolio of spinout projects as fast as possible, in a collaborative and efficient way, leaning into resources from the community and VitaCore to accelerate projects’ development.\n\n11. VitaCORE has the right to reassign a project to a different project lead based on performance with a majority vote\n\n12. The builder squad and Molecule commit to find a constructive relationship as projects become fractionalized, taking into account the constraints imposed by the governance of intellectual property tokens, with the common goal of making each project a commercial success\n\n**The main features of this setup are:**\n\n* Giving the responsibility to those who are most qualified and who know the project best: the project leads\n\n* Avoiding unnecessary management layers, boosting speed and efficiency\n\n* Ensuring focus on a single well defined mission\n\nThis setup is compatible with a relatively reduced number of projects, some of which require relatively little supervision. As we scale, this setup may need to evolve.",

      "content": "***One liner:** Magnaeutus Therapeutics is developing a first-in-class agent for weight loss and metabolic disease.*\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifu2lcvf6kiz3rez2hltpprsmciyhsbfepqpwiekvrscdyrjefzsi)\n    \n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG team\n\n* **Scientific evaluation:** 2 biotech managers, 2 scientists, 1 pharma consultant\n* **Shepherd:** Jason C. Mercurio, Eleanor Davies\n* **Other squad members:** Maria Marinova, Rhys Anderson\n* **Sourced by:** Jason C. Mercurio\n## Project PIs: \n* **Guy Barry, Paul Baldock**\n\n## Simple Summary\nMagnaetus Therapeutics aims to reverse age-related metabolic decline through the development of an exercise mimetic. They intend to develop a therapeutic that will have the effect of weight loss and targeting obesity as well as extending healthspan.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreie2q4hfczeo2vq6bwenp42ywm6k27swajss3a564xca6a7lddlc64)\n    \n## Problem\nObesity and metabolic syndrome have reached crisis levels with almost no effective, patient supported interventions. By 2035, an estimated 50% of the world’s population will be overweight or obese (4.5 billion people).\n\nCurrently, patients are offered ozempic, although this is associated with severe side effects including pancreatitis, hypoglycemia and kidney failure amongst others. Alternatively, there are extreme bariatric surgery measures such as gastric banding.\n\n## Solution\nMagnaeutus Therapeutics is developing a peptide therapy, based on an endogenous protein that mimics the beneficial effects of calorie restriction and exercise. This peptide is thought to reduce fat mass whilst preserving lean tissue.\n\n## Opportunity\nThe weight loss and weight management diet market size was valued at $192 billion in 2019, and is projected to reach $295 billion by 2027. Ozempic (Novo Nordisk) alone had 2022 sales of $8.56 billion.\n\nFollowing 15 years of research, Magnaetus Therapeutics has identified an endogenous protein that stimulates energy release and consumption, rather than conservation. Serum levels of this protein are suppressed by obesity, but stimulated by calorie restriction and exercise.\n\nClassified as an extracellular matrix molecule secreted into the extracellular space, it acts via interaction with cell surface receptors, and has a wide range of activities. Importantly, it also circulates, consistent with inter-organ actions and metabolic responses. Multiple repeat loops provide specific binding activities.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifpduzxdqbtgmvb5tgc7ltmsbf2bmrrsuffrbzvk7qntqkqwitrxu)\n    \nElevated levels are thought to be responsible for the downstream health benefits of exercise and dieting including: increased fat burning, reduced food intake, improved insulin sensitivity and secretion, and improved nutrient signalling.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidda35e4faruco5zzekrxtdk6wsaf62esziysyuayfkzw2r5jhucy)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidxnijusamtnw7yffkejki6biy7cex5hxu266cmvbqkd75eidk2ia)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidyrhn5efvxo5bds63p2kwombgs73jswy5rolc7ye556ansmk5mee)\n        \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreib2tehdsfhxtgeuapaeaufqahkscum6y5fbqymuupqjnahko2y4ha)\n    \n\n## Relevance to longevity\nThe therapeutic being developed targets metabolism systems thereby directly impacting longevity.\n\n## IP Roadmap\nThe team is working towards a composition of matter patent. The aim is to file a PCT after lead isolation studies with Dominique Bridon and then apply for a full RCT after healthspan and metabolic studies with Brian Kennedy are complete (7-9 months).\n\nThe protein is not heavily studied (86 papers with protein in title, 256 total), cancer/cardiac function dominates literature and thus do not anticipate being challenged for priority date.\n\n## Experimental Plan\n**Year 1**\n* Synthesis of proteins (12 weeks)\n* Solid phase synthesis (SPPS) for production, HPLC and MS for characterisation to deliver 2-3 core proteins and their analogues (about 3-5 for each core protein) that mimic protein structure.\n* In-vitro screening (12 weeks)\n* Cell-based assays to define critical aspects of protein activity profile: weight loss and longevity mTOR/AKT (MCF7, MIN6): Insulin (MIN6): Lipolysis (3T3-E1): Glucose, AMPK (C2C12).\n* In-vivo screening (20 weeks)\n* Acute murine studies in HFD to define critical aspects of protein activity profile: weight loss and longevity. Weight loss, fat mass, food intake, GTT, ITT, energy expenditure, muscle + adipose (mTOR, AKT, AMPK), serum.\n\nThe team has worked through the generation of data on animal studies to determine how their protein of interest operates in the body. They have looked at mouse models and have also determined that their protein of interest is in adipose tissue, muscle and bone. It is not found in the pancreas.\n\n## Budget\n**Year 1 go/no go milestone: USD 500,000**\n* Incorporated\n* Past rounds: They have not raised capital for this company before.\n* The team has yet to decide on an exact valuation although it may be around a USD 3-5M post-money valuation.\n\n## Financing and VitaDAO Terms\nThe team is raising a total of USD 500K for the initial seed round. They have allocated USD 100K for the VitaDAO community. The lead investor would fund USD 400K. \n\n## Team\n* **Guy Barry, PhD — CEO**\n25 years experience with 11 in biotech with an emphasis on metabolic, neural and cardiovascular mechanisms. Worked in academia where he performed research on IPS cells, long non-coding RNA, cancer, G-Protein Coupled Receptors, and bioinformatics.\n\n* **Paul Baldock, PhD — CSO**\n25 years experience with extensive time in academia — researcher with an emphasis on in-vivo models, metabolic, musculoskeletal, glycaemic, neural, endocrine, and cancer. Identified the unique protein that serves as a longevity target through metabolism optimization.\n\n* **Brian Kennedy, PhD — Advisor**\n\n* Dominique Bridon, PhD — Advisor**\n\n## Additional information\nDeck: [Magnaetus Therapeutics Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1raNG89tY4jm1tPZmQciyBQN7E8GqjP0n/view?usp=drive_link)\n\n*Newer deck available with NDA*\n\n## Highlights\nAs above\n\n## Risks\n**Customer Risks**\nThe potential for causing more harm than benefit or adversely affecting daily life is low. This is largely because the protein in question is naturally occurring in the human body. Interestingly, the high cost is not seen as a risk. Insurance companies are generally willing to cover the costs of medications that benefit patients, and the FDA often grants exclusive rights to newly approved drugs.\n\n**Product Risks**\nThere could be side effects from the developed drug although this is minimal since the body already contains the protein and it’s natural.\n\n**Go-To-Market & Business Model Risks**\nThere could be competing products when going to market with an exercise mimetic and weight loss drug.\n\n**Team Risks**\nThe founders have been working together for many years. There is a risk of getting more team members efficiently as their organization grows.\n\n## Bibliography\n\n* [Eli Lilly and Company Lilly to Acquire Versanis to Improve Patient Outcomes in Cardiometabolic Diseases](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-acquire-versanis-improve-patient-outcomes-cardiometabolic)\n\n## Senior Review Digest - Quantitative\nBelow is the average scores out of 5 per category from 5 reviewers, who all recommended that the project should be advanced for community feedback.\n\n**Average Scores:**\n* Novelty & Impact 3.6\n* Feasibility & Data 3.6\n* Relevance 4\n* Science Team 3.8\n* Market Advantage 3\n* IP Potential 3.25\n* General Conviction Score 3.6\n\n## Senior Review Digest - Qualitative\n\n**Reviewer 1**\nMy questions have been answered very well, and took away some of the worries I had on IP and general approach. I think the team has provided quite some convincing data in one of the hottest fields of pharma at the moment, which is also one of those fields that is relevant for longevity. There are 2 major points that I’d like the community to be aware of for the voting:\n\n1. It is a serious problem the receptor is not identified. Pharmacological modelling will be practically impossible, making dose-predictions etc a true headache. In pharma companies, this would be an early kill for the project and will make your partnering possibility at early stage very challenging. I would advise to include a biopharmaceutical pharmacologist very early onwards in the project to work on this.\n\n2. To me, the mTOR effect is still a serious worry for this project. Although I think the experiment they’ve done is interesting, perhaps just doing a prolonged treatment in elderly mice and monitoring pmTOR in leukocytes (as a proxy) would be a good way to address this?\n\n**Reviewer 2**\nAlthough no direct relationship or direct mechanistic action with aging, I am enthusiastic about their idea to use parts of the ECM and the protein of interest to target obesity (and metabolic dysregulation), which definitely will have a big impact on the aging society. Also, if they succeed, Novo Nordisk or Eli Lilly is likely to acquire them.\n\n**Reviewer 3**\nAfter reevaluating the data based on the company’s answers, they do indeed look promising and would allow VitaDAO to enter the weight-loss market. From a commercial perspective, my key concerns are the limited knowledge by the team of what is being developed outside of the two weight-loss drugs that are already commercialized and the lack of a Target Product Profile to be presented to physicians for feedback. I would also recommend as soon as it is feasible to generate head-to-head data vs semaglutide (Novo Nordisk) and tirzepatide (Eli Lilly). Also, given the size of the market, this is not a drug that can be developed and sold on its own, and Business Development activities targeted at Big Pharma must be initiated as soon as possible\n\n**Reviewer 4**\nAll of my questions are answered thoroughly and satisfactorily. I believe the approach Magnaetus Therapeutics is taking and experiments planned together with their research collaborators is very well designed and will be helpful to gain a lot of insights during the study. Fast IP protection should be considered in this project. I would further recommend providing funding to this project by VitaDAO given its direct application on longevity and age related diseases.\n\n**Reviewer 5**\nMagnaetus is proposing a very diligent approach to identify the most promising elements to achieve the intended functionality. A step-by-step program is proposed and one may question if some work could be speeded-up by a more intertwined planning and execution. In fact, the team agreed during the Q&A session that shortening of the plans is feasible. It is noted that it took the team fairly long to provide answers to the questions raised by the VitaDAO team. Execution speed is a concern.\n\nThe team has a strong background in research, medicinal chemistry and early stage drug development. The team would benefit from entrepreneurial expertise and speed to ensure that research efforts are well aligned with business needs to attract further funding and build the company for success towards an exit strategy. At this stage, limited information is available. The team is currently planning for a 6 monthly implant, which is a demanding pharmaceutical presentation. Except for the TPP, appropriate responses to my questions were provided. In summary, I recommend funding of this project by VitaDAO.\n\n## Vote\nHere, you, the VITA token holders, are voting to agree or disagree with the Longevity-Dealflow WG’s and senior reviewers' assessment of this company.",

      "title": "VDP-129 [Assessment]: Vitalia - a city that builds longevity companies ",
      "content": "**One-liner**: [Vitalia.city](http://vitalia.city) is a city that accelerates the development of longevity biotech.\n\n# Simple Summary\n\n[Vitalia.city](http://vitalia.city/) is a movement to start a longevity network city. The city will be distributed into 3-5 hubs in different special economic zones. In these hubs, we build companies and work on the technology and science to make death optional.\n\nThe MVP is a 2-month “pop-up city”, like [Zuzalu.city](http://zuzalu.city). With the upcoming gathering, we aim to give people a taste of what it’s like to live in close proximity with 200+ like-minded people for 2 months, with the goal of having 20+ permanent residents stay over and incubate 10-15 new companies/projects.\n\nThe upcoming pop-up city is happening between Jan 6 - Mar 1, 2024 on the Caribbean island of Roatán, with one of the districts being in the [Próspera](http://prospera.hn) Special Economic Zone, where clinical trials can be run orders of magnitude faster and cheaper.\n\n \n![image6.jpg](ipfs://bafybeibiev75tgcogscrgoa7rhojlvyga2askn5awjdlnhzt5c6yb3pqea)\n    \n\n # Problem\n\n \n![image2.png](ipfs://bafkreigcrsxo7x3ido3tziczesyjf2nrvcypzwhzpzvw2ihju7wpzjysci)\n    \n\nThere are formidable barriers to bringing potential medicines to market. Progress is strangulated by over-regulation. Animal models are not good predictive models. Instead of Moore’s Law, we have the inverse, Eroom’s Law (coined by Jack Scannell; [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-022-00552-x))\n\n# Opportunity\n\nVitaDAO is an online network, but we cannot give people online drugs. We need locations for faster trials. Semi-autonomous zones for an in-person community to govern itself, trying a better regulatory framework, where self-experimentation is allowed, enabling potential treatments (that are stuck in the 10+ year-long approval pipeline) to save millions of lives.\n\nThis is paramount for achieving longevity escape velocity within 1-3 decades.\n\nCreating new cities is a bold vision. A world-class medical innovation zone is desirable for host countries, providing win-win economics.\n\nThe return profile is unprecedented.\n\nLongevity already is a $tn opportunity by itself, with Vitalia capturing equity value primarily as an accelerator for new companies.\n\nThe value-add for the incubated companies is the location (land value appreciation) and the community (token economy).\n\nThe land upside has a venture-scale return profile but with downside protection. Vitalia will own cheap land and differential upside on sub-leasing (in places like Próspera).\n\nInitially, the funds will be held in one “mothership” entity that focuses on 1) community development, 2) company acceleration, and 3) land & jurisdictional business development.\n\nAs Vitalia grows, it will create two more entities for the different risk profiles: a) a VC fund and B) a real estate and land development fund (similar to Próspera). It will also act as a service provider, capturing up to 7% of each district’s governance token (similar to Molecule)\n\n ![image4.jpg](ipfs://bafybeihpfodmin7gqanqbblyo7imyhvwsvevbddj6ndcbpluxtuh6qgr4i)\n\n![image1.png](ipfs://bafkreibjzw2aakbxxmwy7ezpn4trt473h6t32upucn44hxfdvwlf742hbq)\n\n![image3.jpg](ipfs://bafybeigihpjrw7udzqw3vlfe4gc35h3xdnm2gnjrhhrds6xlaxhjf33gby)\n![image5.jpg](ipfs://bafkreicl3drghn5fsnrhxwuzp4pqo7wyucdc7tydw5kx4jofjymamjcvjq)\n    \n# Relevance to longevity\n\nProviding a “warp speed” pathway for longevity therapeutics will radically accelerate progress toward achieving extended healthy human lifespans for all.\n\n # Financing\n\nVitalia is raising a $1M pre-seed round at a $10M post-money valuation cap via a SAFE note, and has reserved up to $200K for the VitaDAO community.\n\n# Additional information\n\n* **Deck**: https://docsend.com/view/uzkh4r4vsjcfknzc\n* **5-min presentation** at Balaji Srinivasan’s The Network State Conference 2023: https://twitter.com/vita_dao/status/1719054445940502767",

      "title": "VDP-126 [Assessment] Remedium Bio ",
      "content": "Remedium Bio is a regenerative medicine biotechnology company, which has developed the ***only dose adjustable gene therapy platform*** technology ***Prometheus™*** and is currently advancing multiple assets with uncorrelated risk to Investigational New Drug (IND) approval.\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG Team\n\n* **Senior reviewers**: 2 biotech entrepreneurs and 3 biotech VC\n\n* **Shepherd**: Paolo Binetti\n* **Squad members**: Ryan Spangler, Tovah Wolf\n* **Sourced by**: Paolo Binetti via lifespan.io Longevity Investor Network\n\n## Project PI\n\n* **Frank Luppino, founder & CEO**\n\n## Simple Summary\n\n***Remedium is a regenerative medicine biotech focused on age-related diseases and large unmet clinical needs*** . Remedium has multiple assets targeting large unmet clinical needs that show advantages over currently approved products, with significant benefits to healthspan.\n\nThe company has also developed a platform gene delivery technology that overcomes limitations of current generation technologies, with the potential to revolutionize therapeutic protein delivery. Prometheus™ is delivered as a simple subcutaneous injection, remains highly localized, and provides durable expression while offering functionality not available with other gene delivery technologies. The platform can deliver a wide range of genetic cargo using a ***non-antigenic vector*** and can be ***easily re-dosed to augment treatment or down-titrated to reduce the level of therapeutic transgene expression***.\n\nRemedium’s lead candidate is a first-in-class disease modifying regenerative treatment for **Osteoarthritis (OA)**. The treatment augments expression of an endogenous protein, FGF18, that is critical to the formation and maintenance of healthy cartilage, levels of which are known to decline with age. A ***single intra-articular injection*** turns back the clock in the joint, resulting in unprecedented efficacy in a translatable model of primary OA.\n\nBesides knee OA, the Prometheus™ platform is in active preparation for licensing to large pharma and biotech companies and has been evaluated as a first-in-class single injection treatment for **obesity and Type 2 diabetes (T2D)**, where it is ***promoting weight loss*, *improving glucose control, and insulin tolerance*** in a well-established preclinical model of the disease. Remedium’s treatment results in similar efficacy to currently commercially approved ***‘daily’*** incretins, while minimizing pharmacokinetic sawtoothing, which may drastically improve the treatment’s safety and tolerability.\n\n## The Problem\n\n### Osteoarthritis\n\nOA is the largest unmet need in rheumatology and the leading cause of joint replacements. To date, however, only one therapeutic approach, repeat and continual ***FGF18 injections have demonstrated the ability to increase cartilage thickness in placebo controlled clinical studies***, while also demonstrating improvement in symptom progression and a complete arrest of progression to joint replacement surgery. That treatment modality, however, is ***limited by pharmacokinetics of the joints.*** Since cartilage is avascular, local treatment is required, however, therapeutics delivered locally are rapidly cleared from the joint, limiting efficacy. As such, ***FGF18 protein injections require up to 12 injections per year*** in bilateral OA and may need to be sustained indefinitely to prevent reversal of cartilage loss. An ideal approach would utilize a therapeutic that works (FGF18) and deliver it in a means that would produce efficacy without being pharmacokinetically limited by rapid washout (Fig 1).\n\n\n \n![Picture1.jpg](ipfs://bafkreige6efkyd2lk4m6gnnldrfqxch46qchw45i25b2v4dwa6rqkqnmvu)\n    \n\n### Protein-based treatments and Gene Therapy\n\nProtein-based treatments have revolutionized medicine, however, they ***remain expensive*** to develop and administer and are ***limited by pharmacokinetic sawtoothing***, which results in peaks and troughs that limit safety and efficacy of repeat protein injection therapies.\n\nGene therapy has the potential to solve these issues, but ***current generation technologies are extremely expensive and doses cannot be adjusted up or down following initial administration***. Moreover, once a gene therapy treatment is administered it cannot be discontinued, preventing its use as a protein replacement therapy (Fig 2).\n\n \n![Picture2 (1).jpg](ipfs://bafybeihpxekd35zde4dksc3per7q7u6v43lz4zobdmwcsa4nxrzblkyaeq)\n    \n### Type 2 diabetes and Obesity\n\nGLP1 Receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) have revolutionized treatment of Type 2 diabetes and obesity. Despite their success, however, they remain expensive, and are limited by gastrointestinal side effects that result in a nearly ***70% discontinuation rate after the first year of treatment*** (Fig 3). The side effects have been attributed to the pharmacokinetic spikes following treatment, which do not appear necessary to achieve therapeutic efficacy. ***Eliminating the pharmacokinetic spikes*** and ***reducing the need for daily or weekly injections*** would result ***in significant improvements in treatment adherence***, maximizing the benefits of this therapy.\n\n \n![Picture3.jpg](ipfs://bafybeibhk52yabnruvm2ayknwwkiohm6ojsux2za7rbs6dlt5n52tszzy4)\n    \n## The Solution\n\n### RMD1101 Regenerative Treatment for OA\n\nRMD1101 is a single, intra-articular injection delivering the FGF18 transgene to arthritic joints, facilitating regeneration that has been confirmed in a clinically translatable model of OA. The single injection treatment of RMD1101 was able to preserve cartilage and subchondral bone geometry in the destabilized medial meniscus model of OA. **RMD1101 demonstrated dose-dependent increases in cartilage thickness relative to the placebo control (PBS) as well as compared with the positive control** (FGF18 protein treatment, rhFGF18) (Fig 4).\n\n \n![Picture4.jpg](ipfs://bafybeif62amqgcv5uwo564hze3msewa27jwaxozaiihewuu6gjs4nd5y4e)\n    \nRMD1101 also showed improved safety, as shown in Fig 5.\n\n \n![Picture5.jpg](ipfs://bafkreifbfr2s6dttxexzp4m7plt5cbp3zzutb52ow3wydivuqdfsgzztue)\n    \nThe breadth and consistency of response to RMD1101 are unprecedented in the treatment of OA and demonstrated in Fig 6 showing histology from all joints collected in the in vivo efficacy study. There is clear and extensive degeneration in the vehicle / PBS treated joints (top row) and near-normal cartilage appearance of the RMD1101 / High Dose gene therapy treated joints (bottom row).\n\n \n![Picture6.jpg](ipfs://bafybeiabvaidgdoglgvu7eapecdnpslrpbkx632yztp34gnocqptndptr4)\n    \n### Prometheus™ Dose Adjustable Gene Therapy Platform\n\nRemedium has developed the solution to the challenges constraining gene therapies (unadjustability of the treatment dose following initial administration) and recombinant protein treatments (cost and pharmacokinetic sawtoothing caused by repeat injections). The Prometheus™ dose adjustable gene therapy platform (Fig 7) technology for the first time enables ***the replacement of a number of subcutaneous protein injection therapies as a single injection***. The treatment is durable, adjustable, highly localized, does not impact any life- or function-sustaining organ and is ***non-antigenic, facilitating re-dosing***. Most importantly, the treatment can be easily scaled and produced at a fraction of the cost of even the current protein therapies.\n \n![Picture7.jpg](ipfs://bafybeieabnclag2kxlycqkbsjqiemz2joa635j5pqdv7as75soxtqfwio4)\n    \n\nIn vivo testing of Prometheus™ confirms its ability to deliver transgenes to the subcutis and that the treatment can be easily augmented by repeat dosing, following initial administration (Fig 8). Studies show the ***treatment remains durable over a period of half a year***, without any observed transgene expression decline. The mechanism for enabling said durability, delivery vector, genetic constructs, and means of dose adjustment are ***proprietary and exclusive*** to Remedium.\n\n \n![Picture8.jpg](ipfs://bafybeigi3t6wb2j3gtavlu7vhjcyicobeiaybj7jsaqoviof7xbhwra3sy)\n    \nMoreover, the system can be easily down-titrated following initial administration. Fig 9 shows reduction of reporter gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. This can be accomplished via pharmacological or physical methods that are safe and exceptionally well tolerated. As the technology is highly scalable, ***a single treatment cost could be as low as $50 per injection at scale***. Remedium is currently advancing this platform to in vivo efficacy and finalizing the licensing package to ***enable partnerships with large pharma and biotech companies in the first half of 2024.***\n \n![Picture9.jpg](ipfs://bafkreibreijhuslagxpmb6mm5qskrer3anzhr6xmtcbmkttvn7rw6fkmhq)\n    \n\nPrometheus™ has a ***large cargo capacity*** and is versatile: initial proof of concept studies have demonstrated the ***ability to express incretins (GLP1 Receptor Agonists), insulin, and full-length monoclonal antibodies***. Future efforts will focus on supplementation of longevity factors, suppression of chronic inflammation, and enzyme replacement therapies (Fig 10).\n\n \n![Picture10.jpg](ipfs://bafybeidhzba2zz5vzxqauboafvk6uzwvgt4jg2k6yehrah5chrsixcm6xm)\n    \n### RMD1202 Treatment for Obesity and Type 2 diabetes\n\nRemedium’s second pipeline asset is an innovative treatment for Obesity and Type 2 diabetes, utilizing Prometheus™. RMD1202 has been evaluated in a well-established high fat diet (HFD) and Streptozotocin induced model of late-stage Type 2 diabetes, where it has demonstrated the ability to deliver the **same efficacy as daily Exenatide (GLP-1 Receptor Agonist) injections** over the 4-wk study period. Statistically significant improvement in weight loss, and glucose / insulin tolerance relative to control are shown in Fig 11.\n\n \n![Picture11.jpg](ipfs://bafkreibfmpcntqob6tk7uhwttaawoyuajbyykyurzcb5m44le5sukypbiy)\n    \nThe treatment produced the aforementioned efficacy on top of an outstanding safety profile and is anticipated to nearly completely eliminate pharmacokinetic spikes associated with repeat GLP-1 RA peptide injections, which are the main drivers of gastrointestinal side-effects causing treatment discontinuation. Thus, the approach is anticipated to be not only cost effective and simpler to administer, but also better tolerated.\n\n## Opportunity\n\nOA is the largest unmet clinical need in rheumatology and is estimated to impact 1 in 7 adults, as the leading cause of joint replacements worldwide. The market for OA and related treatments are estimated at over $50B globally (Fig. 12).\n\n \n![Picture12.jpg](ipfs://bafybeifo6l3rzevteh32cz6z5bc6kvyyzrrbuigeaqlvjcffchr7ip52cy)\n    \nType 2 diabetes and Obesity are highly prevalent conditions that adversely impact longevity and healthspan. Current estimates place the market for T2D and Obesity at over $30B US. \n\nThe ability of the platform to replace monoclonal therapies, treatments for diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, enzyme replacement therapies, and augment lost protein expression to enhance longevity can result in a plethora of highly lucrative partnerships for the company.\n\n## Relevance to Longevity\n\nAs we age, several critical to function genes decline in the level and quality of gene expression. A number of them, such as FGF18, FGF21, and Alpha-Klotho, have been implicated in promoting healthspan and lifespan. Prometheus™ is an ***effective method of replacing proteins adversely impacted by age-related decline***, whereas traditional gene therapy approaches are immunogenic, extremely expensive, cannot be re-dosed, and cannot be adjusted following initial administration.\n\nRemedium’s lead candidate is a regenerative therapy for the treatment of OA, a characteristic disease of aging where cartilage is lost over time causing loss of joint function. Remedium technology is therefore well positioned to prevent health related decline in the age-related degenerative pathology of the joint and translate to other areas of healthspan and lifespan.\n\n## IP Roadmap\n\n**Remedium maintains a robust IP portfolio for its lead OA gene therapy, and pipeline products**. To enable the optimal level of IP protection, Remedium has contracted Wolf Greenfield, a biotech-focused IP firm with specific expertise in gene therapy. The Remedium team has extensive and diversified expertise ideating, drafting, submitting, and defending IP with nearly 190 patents and pending applications. IP is ideated internally and Remedium performs internal freedom to operate and patentability assessments prior to preparing provisional applications. Its lead OA PCT has been published and is in national filing stages. In addition, Remedium has a portfolio of 7 provisional patents covering the lead indication, platform technology, and pipeline assets that enable extensive protection of its innovative technology. See the pipeline in Fig. 13.\n\n \n![Picture13.jpg](ipfs://bafkreigtozgfxjmcdc6nfbaw6xr6pyrtvtkseequrnedom52h6hsq3ewxy)\n    \n## Planning and Milestones\n\nThe series-A two-year planning to bring the three key assets  to clinical trials is provided in Fig. 14.\n\n \n![Picture14.jpg](ipfs://bafybeiehr5v7fcmlflrmzkxqu6t5mgnd77u2wqnj5itqmdwu74lncrnyia)\n    \n## Budget\n\nRemedium is currently raising **a $15M Series A round**. Through the end of 2024, Remedium is planning the following use of capital:\n\n**OA IND-enabling work:** $6.3M focused on toxicology batch production, IND-enabling preclinical study completion, and preparation of the IND submission.\n\n**PrometheusTM Development:** $2.0M focused on full platform characterization and enablement of licensing for partnered therapeutic indications.\n\n**General R&D and SG&A:** $1.8M to support pipeline assets and operational activities including R&D, Operations, External Manufacturing, Quality, and Regulatory.\n\n**BD, IP, Software, Office, Misc:** $1.1M to support partnership activities, IP advancement to national phases and PCT applications, software, office space and other expenses.\n\nRemedium has developed 3 assets and a platform technology through in vivo efficacy on a **total initial raise of approximately $3.5M** and plans to continue highly efficient use of capital into the future to maximally extend runway and enable maximum value creation for the investors.\n\n## Financing and VitaDAO Fundings Terms\n\n**Remedium was founded in 2021 and raised an expanded seed round of approximately $3.5M, of which over $1M was committed by the CEO**. All funds to date have been invested as a SAFE (20% discount, $25M cap). Remedium is a Delaware corporation, currently raising a Series A, targeting a $15M raise and has identified a reputable VC to lead the round. **Remedium’s current investors include the LongevityTech Fund, MicroVentures, Angel Star Ventures, Primo Medical Group, Sherwood Ventures, Apis Health Angels, Guindy Alumni Angels**, as well as several prominent angel investors who are/were former biotech industry executives. For a limited time, Remedium is continuing to accept investments under the SAFE to bridge closing of the Series A.\n\n**An allocation of $50k is available for VitaDAO community.**\n\n## Team\n\nThe team has over **50 years experience in biotechnology with a focus on biologics, regenerative medicine, and gene therapy**. The leadership is comprised of seasoned industry executives who have a **track record taking companies from a market cap of $6M to $1B** and developing / industrializing / licensing products to global pharma and biotech giants including JNJ, Bohringer Ingelheim, and Sanofi (Fig. 15).\n\n \n![Picture15.jpg](ipfs://bafybeig5vayayvexnbhdyng7rjp2pp5ucno27upw6jp3h3ot6bq6l56eb4)\n    \nThe company has additionally hired a cadre of top clinical and scientific advisors in the therapeutic areas of focus. Their advisors have a wealth of scientific expertise in the disease areas, extensive experience in clinical development, and the clinical background necessary to drive product design (Fig. 16).\n\n \n![Picture16.jpg](ipfs://bafybeigvzu642d5zcyvdpaq2ghcagn5qvclkdowy7w2xyq53kcp2twa5eq)\n    \n## Pitch\n\nSlide Deck: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1n-wE_j4YrS50g9LhmdhCx6ZvUIFcSJuH&usp=drive_fs\n\nPitch recording: https://drive.google.com/file/d/12cfxJ52I487emQmDN5pKefHInNUqZgVK/view\n\n## Highlights\n\n* **Prometheus™:** a unique platform technology capable of delivering peptides to antibodies as a single injection, adjustable dose gene therapy, at a fraction of the cost of current treatment, applicable to a wide range of potential longevity interventions.\n\n* **RMD1101:** regenerative gene therapy for the treatment of Osteoarthritis based on the only clinically validated mechanism of therapeutic activity – FGF18.\n* **RMD1202:** single injection, which performs as well as daily GLP-1 RA injections in a translatable model of T2D, without the pharmacokinetic spikes that drive the discontinuation causing side effects.\n* **Team:** the leadership team is comprised of seasoned industry veterans with extensive background successfully developing, industrializing, facilitating approval, and licensing blockbuster therapies.\n\n## Risks\n\n**Risks for Remedium Bio are standard corporate risks associated with a preclinical biotech including:**\n* Manufacturing / CMC\n\n* Toxicology IND-enabling studies\n* Regulatory\n* financing risks associated with the current market environment\n\nRemedium has undertaken **several risk mitigation strategies** to reduce risk associated with its programs, including:\n\n1) Utilization of 2 contract development and manufacturing organizations to scale-up the lead candidate product and produce Toxicology / IND-enabling preclinical study batch.\n\n2) Completion of extensive biodistribution/safety/efficacy testing in relevant preclinical models to maximally derisk IND-enabling GLP studies.\n\n3) Utilization of proven technological elements with clinical level validation, e.g. the FGF18 transgene has been clinically confirmed as functional in a placebo controlled randomized trial.\n\n4) Pursuit of a tiered intellectual property strategy where multiple technological elements (e.g. formulations, doses, genetic constructs) are protected in subsequent applications to optimally secure IP.\n\n5) Maximally efficient use of funds through reliance on academic collaborations for research and development activities with internalization of only critical to function staff.\n\n## References\n\nPlease see the Discourse proposal for the list of references.\n\n## Senior Review Digest - Quantitative\nBelow is the average scores out of 5 per category from 5 reviewers, who all recommended that the project should be advanced for token-holders vote.\n\n**Average Scores**\n* Team Expertise: 4.4\n* Feasibility & Data: 4.0\n* Commercial Potential & Impact: 4.6\n* Novelty & Market Advantage: 4.0\n* IP Defensibility: 3.5\n* Relevance to Longevity: 4.0\n* Deal Terms: 3.6\n* **General Conviction Score 4.2** (for reference, the average score of past funded projects is 3.7)\n\n## Senior Review Digest - Qualitative\nEach reviewer was asked whether they would endorse the project, below are their answers.\n\n**Reviewer 1**\nI would suggest funding the project, mainly because of its potential applications in gene therapy and longevity therapeutics. It could provide a safer way for several gene therapies. Additionally, VitaDAO could think of finding synergies with other portfolio companies as a gene delivery system and so on. \n\n**Reviewer 2**\nI like the concept of innovative platforms, but with the little information I have right now I would be hesitant to support it. That's mainly driven by the poor understanding of the platform technology, so once that has been cleared, I could. \n\n**Reviewer 3**\nYes, based on what little i know, I'm very excited about this project. \n\n**Reviewer 4**\nYes, for a 50k check. Advice is to wait for a lead investor because this project will need a large amount of capital to hit the key value inflection milestone. \n\n**Reviewer 5**\nYes.

      "content": "## Summary:\n\nThe VitaDAO Community Ambassador Initiative is designed to empower mission-aligned individuals globally to foster community growth, engage in outreach, and host in-person events, promoting VitaDAO's vision of decentralized funding for early-stage longevity research.\n\n## Relevance to Strategic Plan:\n\nThis initiative aligns with VitaDAO’s primary strategic goals of:\n\n1. Amplifying Community Engagement and Size.\n2. Enhancing Brand Awareness within General and Niche Audiences.\n3. Encouraging Decentralized Governance and Participation.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nBy tapping into the power of localized communities, we aim to promote VitaDAO's values, increase VITA token utility and awareness, and spur meaningful in-person interactions. This aligns with the foundational principles of Ethereum and web3—empowering communities to drive change.\n\n## Ambassador Squad Core Team:\n\n@alexdobrin @Alex @m_marinova @estherk @Adrian Matysek, Andreas Melhede, @gweisha \n\nDecentralized Governance Framework:\n\nAmbassadors will report to the Ambassador squad core team, but all major decisions related to budgets, and modifications to the program will be presented to VitaCore.\n\nAmbassador Criteria:\n\n* Successfully undergo a screening process including a call to verify identity.\n* Conversational proficiency in English.\n* Submission of a comprehensive plan for their Ambassador activities.\n* Completion of VitaDAO training modules.\n* Preferred: Local ties to communities such as academic research, biohacking, web3, venture, etc.\n* Organisations and university societies can act as partner or ambassador organisations. They would organised joint events and not require ambassador compensation because we are sponsoring their event and community.\n\n## Event Approval and Governance:\n\nEvents need pre-approval by the Ambassador squad and VitaDAO.\n\nApproval is based on the initiative’s budget, strategic alignment, event proposal, and the Ambassador’s past records.\n\nCompensation and Reimbursement:\n\n## Event Budget\n\nCompensation can be claimed after a successful event. Payment bounty ranging from $100 - $200 USD, with bonuses based on attendance and views.\n\nA referral and commission mechanism will be considered for future implementation.\n\nBounties may be added for valuable conversions, e.g., new regular contributors.\n\n## Implementation Metrics:\n\n## Quantitative:\n\nNumber of events: 5 per month\n\nAttendees per event: 20-40\n\nRecurring attendees: Min 15%\n\nAmbassadors recruited: Min 10\n\nLocal communities engaged: 10\n\nAcademic institutions partnerships: 3-5/quarter\n\n## Qualitative:\n\nInstitution quality: Vetted by unbiased team members.\n\nCommunity feedback: 1-5 star rating system with feedback provision.\n\nBudget Proposal:\n\nTotal 6-month budget: 21,750 USDC & 9,500 vested VITA tokens\n\nAmbassador squad compensation: 6,750 USDC\n\nEvent Reimbursements: Up to $750 per event (based on 10 ambassadors with 2 events each)\n\nAmbassador Compensation: Up to $200 per event (based on performance metrics and dependent on geographic location). Option for bonuses on multiple or highly successful events in strategic locations.\n\nTeam Rewards: 1,500 VITA (based on 10 VITA/hr and additional performance incentives)\n\nAirdrops for New Contributors: Up to 150 VITA per event\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nBy adopting this proposal, VitaDAO aims to merge the best of decentralized governance with community-driven outreach, fostering genuine growth and enhancing its global footprint.",

      "title": "VDP-120 [Assessment]: Oisín Biotechnologies - Genetic Medicines for Health and Longevity",
      "content": "*One-liner:* Oisín Biotechnologies is a multi-asset longevity biotech company pioneering genetic medicines to combat sarcopenia and other age-related diseases to promote healthier, longer lives.\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG team\n\n* **Senior Reviewers:** 2 scientists, 1 pharma professional, 1 VC, 1 biotech entrepreneur\n* **Shepherd:** Eleanor Davies\n* **Other squad members:** Paolo Binetti, Ryan Spangler, Tuan Dinh\n\n## Project PI:\n* **Matthew Scholz, CEO & Co-founder**\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nOisin Biotechnologies is a company dedicated to developing genetic medicines that address a range of age-related diseases. Their lead candidate aims to build muscle without exercise, which could be used as a therapy to make older people stronger. The company has assets that selectively kill adipocytes and senescent cells which are believed to play a significant role in the aging process and the onset of age-related diseases. Oisin has generated in-vivo data and has already licensed its technology to pharmaceutical companies.\n\nBy leveraging their royalty-free licence to Entos’ Fusogenix Proteo-Lipid Vehicle (PLV) platform, Oisín aims to deliver specific genes to alter cell behavior, or in the case of problematic cells, inducing apoptosis and thereby rejuvenating tissues or improving physical function.\n\nThis delivery system is not only safer and more cost-effective than other prevalent systems such as viral approaches, but also ensures consistent and reproducible outcomes. If successful in human trials and upon regulatory approval, this therapy could be a game-changer in the longevity and age-related disease market, potentially becoming available within the next five years.\n\n## Problem\n\nAs the global population ages, the prevalence of age-related diseases, particularly those linked to physical frailty are on the rise. Physical strength is incredibly important. In more extreme cases, a person in a wheelchair or bedridden is effectively living on borrowed time. If they do not get out soon, they may never get out at all. Conversely, robust physical strength allows for greater activity and exercise, improved mobility, enhanced social interactions and higher quality of life. Increased muscle mass improves metabolism, strengthens bone, protects against injury. The challenge lies in maintaining muscle mass in aging populations, particularly following injury, sickness, or surgery. Current interventions are largely limited to diet and exercise.\n\nOisín has identified physical frailty as a key target for therapeutic intervention. By directly increasing skeletal muscle mass and physical strength they aim to not only treat but potentially prevent a myriad of age-related conditions, improving healthspan and potentially even lifespan. Pharmaceutical companies have attempted to make therapeutics that target this pathway for years but have failed to solve the manufacturing challenges needed to produce them at scale. Oisín’s approach, rooted in advanced genetic medicine, offers a promising solution in a field that would be both scalable and cost effective.\n\n## Solution\n\nOisín's cutting-edge technology is designed to deliver DNA and RNA with unparalleled distribution and safety at an unprecedented cost and scale. Using their Fusogenix Proteo-Lipid Vehicle (PLV) platform, they can deliver specific nucleic acid cargos to cells across the body that alter the cells behavior, such as making it produce a therapeutic protein, or in the case of unwanted cells causing them to die via apoptosis or other programmed cell death pathways.\n\nPreliminary results from their research have been promising.

This approach to genetic medicines enables entirely new therapies that hold immense promise for treating age-related diseases and potentially extending healthy lifespan.\n\nOisín has already demonstrated it can vastly improve physical strength in mice, selectively clear senescent cells in mice (resulting in improved lifespan and healthspan), and selectively ablate adipocytes in human tissue explants. They have performed tolerability studies in nonhuman primates at doses far higher than are expected to be used in humans. Importantly, their PLV platform has already made it through Phase II human trials in a COVID vaccine with no safety signals. To accomplish this, they had to demonstrate the ability to manufacture PLV-based therapies at human scale.\n\n![|602x317](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JZUyc83ItOuNJx5KTTxQZb3rsOFzEF3lPNQw81Iv9HtE-suHk1NHz3ElRJg3H_YBQ19cIJQfKlg8q5zETdMACE7s-Smlo6vU0x_CW9cSvxDX5e40b2jHLMWap2KKkVbIIBf6eCXPpOfPIkZEDxYC5_c)\n\n![|602x317](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/x9nQaNefDs2uaHt1vY60tBJis4RST9e8TI1su2xghFRVqp-MK--lZk1tXnMU5KYNBx8kf1PdHLudUwHUjczKh6SZgE6TJxtHSjXbcczies7AYwom7Fbvd3RUCf1kwxAo9evjEJtT5PUeo9aW6B-WKqI)\n\n![|602x317](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/J_yKfr93iuZo33Rl3KMcKVMUyTTpAmzSm2_7zHbUiCj-_C1wNf0U_zl1GyW8PVsORvGEvBBx2big4psMmhvfALVC2KPHqguaQ6f1sYyMiCc-7eutdOaZJswnK2ZfLdFRah1erPs9PqUAYYRsVcOet5Y)\n\n![|602x316](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P5hMgZEEYNSK4HaWUnRa9fu9wd09x5zsQd6vWZxxYrDSG_9E96IxmMC7fH5pajiF4k1JU0Ep-zyiTZk7H842flC7cngO16zEkfD4HQoEwSLDuJq_JqOmFYCoiy4LrH4JquLZpgWkzRiuIxP_enrwlY0)\n\n![|602x335](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RfI-n-WHJ0ItxE9vAZZSfCSrfdopUIbqKCl8-MS9P-hw2JtSu1vdtF_YCdytMeA2IeWiKTGU-c2ukur4zlH32JLRRV_HJvBzgqA5gkKVnv8yR2rd6mQfo8ttZJTUyWaYEb7miiccD5grNe5nLYaqKHw)\n\n![|602x317](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lwG8tQWR1A1_0ZFFdmGfTbQwGaL8n3QRNbQz9GqD8bv_79ILiu8yjh-N60Z4blAB4Py6Zo9q3PZluttizn2od4IfEdanqmk0rB_KBtXAEM6B5S_dEA34VqM7jFHel0MGNvVlhkN-ysY6NbiXoDu-31E)\n\n![|602x316](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fWgzuALiEsI2DeeHMjV-D9BrYDXPRvg4v2VA6hHtdOkiisrb13j94J-8leuAaO1G9OEc9av19cIMeCmBwb2TTgqnaXOAhRw9j5DzyCohQkRrtW1fsMUumAE_Yvnm23ZcEn3AU3NP3YFdvovrFIoKHsQ)\n\n## Opportunity\n\nIn 2020 there were ≈36M patients in the U.S. over the age of 60 with moderate to severe sarcopenia. In 2000, the estimated direct healthcare cost attributable to sarcopenia in the U.S. was $18.5B. This number is only expected to increase. Oisín’s follistatin-based therapy is uniquely positioned to address this market. Pharmaceutical companies have tried and failed to manufacture effective follistatin and myostatin targeted therapies in the past, primarily due to manufacturing challenges. Achieving a high enough dose to be therapeutic has been a challenge for other delivery technologies due to toxicity of the vectors. Viral-based gene therapies are too costly to be broadly deployed and would likely encounter significant immunological challenges in a very large patient population.\n\nOisín plans to initially treat patients prior to surgeries such as ACL repair or hip transplant to protect against disuse atrophy. This allows for a more defined patient population with clear endpoints.\n\nOisín’s technical and IP strengths position it well to aggressively pursue this growing market in particular. Given the vast potential market for effective anti-aging therapies and increasing interest in longevity research, Oisín's approach could capture a significant share of this market. Their therapies could become a cornerstone treatment for age-related diseases, offering both societal and commercial value. In addition, Oisin has exclusive rights to use the Entos’ Fusogenix technology in the field of longevity, giving them an edge in drug delivery.\n\n## Relevance to longevity\n\nSarcopenia and dynapenia are significant drivers of physical frailty and morbidity. Follistatin directly counteracts this as a direct driver of skeletal muscle hypertrophy. They have shown that increasing muscle mass with our follistatin therapy increases physical strength. Increasing physical strength improves healthspan by facilitating greater activity levels, improved metabolic function, and higher quality of life. Increased muscle mass leads to increased bone density and protects against injury. Others have even recently published that follistatin gene therapies can even extend lifespan in animals.\n\nBeyond follistatin, Oisín has a robust pipeline and is positioning itself to become a large pharmaceutical company focused on healthspan and longevity. Their initial focus on validated targets and FDA-centric endpoints is designed to allow for early licensing deals with large pharmaceutical companies. The objective is to bring in enough revenue with these deals to take their own therapies to approval and eventually even commercialization. Their IP position is broad enough to facilitate product development far into the future and capitalize on new science as it emerges.\n\n## IP Roadmap\n\nOisín Biotechnologies has been proactive in protecting its IP pipeline. They have broad exclusive rights to the Fusogenix PLV patent portfolio and hold several patents related to their specific cargos and therapeutic applications. They continue to file new applications as they develop them and have rights to improvements of the PLV delivery technology. This robust IP portfolio positions them well against competitors and ensures they can capitalize on their innovations.\n\n![|602x320](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/igAWNJTqdEPrErkiQjqsbeo82nKRgJ73tGeXuh6tc2YLfskfChXAfL94nVNlhepDlx8taFNs211o4n3BKjopsBCiCVxH14A0V4VWPz3-lp3kQ8YzDOD6ZRRz4RRnmevqNk8EmDrYq-Tu8Tgwv_KZ5i0)\n\n![|602x319](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xHgY3MLOa2E03BB_9svibRzCdRogSSv_YgIOrWlEjJcetdaIUICHtGikjC3pWzoTrwWM-LYTKSCsyCitwmD-8PA8SlhVaqSQAfZUn1zAwhcYSbKQNE5OlKljZNsMq8GuiWX055M2UDvwEqp6rVxSZug)\n\n![|602x316](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cND93fV_O5p-t9GeSa0U9HZA6Om570i4543EDx-TuPWsWr5Ib9f8mwmFh_BZTrQnITIU-HJJIZzW0xhCQKQLWTq0WD0fN15iP5t6I8wE2MTx6UL7-JLo4kHmtgyt9cXNSuvswu2pgFmk4UgXQPN4VcM)\n\nAs they continue their research and development, it is expected that Oisín will further expand its IP holdings, ensuring a dominant position in the longevity biotech sector.\n\n## Budget\n\n**12 Month Budget:**\n\n* Research and Development: $1,666,229\n* Payroll and Related Expense: $1,715,063\n* Consulting: $349,013\n* Lab Rent & Insurance: $166,713\n* Legal: $106,015\n* Intellectual Property: $383,045\n* General and Administrative: $232,624\n\n**Total: $4,618,702**\n\n## Financing and VitaDAO Funding Terms\n\nOisín Biotechnologies is actively seeking funding to propel their research forward. They recognize the value that VitaDAO members bring, both in terms of financial support and expertise. Oisín has allocated 50k for the VitaDAO community under their current SAFE (standard SAFE document, raising up to $5M with a $100M cap, and 15% discount to the next round), ensuring a mutually beneficial partnership. The previous round was in 2021 and also a SAFE. It had a $70M cap and 15% discount. They have verbal commitments for a significant portion of this SAFE and anticipate closing it soon. This closure will also be based on the outcome/time frame resulting from current discussions with pharmaceutical partners.\n\nOisín was incorporated in February 2014 as a Delaware C corporation and has raised $11.2M. Notable investors include SENS Foundation, M Fund, Althea, Kizoo, Healthspan Ventures, and several prominent angel investors in the longevity community. They have already identified a putative lead investor for their subsequent Series A.\n\n## Team\n\n### Leadership\n\n* **Matthew Scholz - CEO & Co-founder:** 20+ years experience starting and running biotech companies.

This allows for the targeted delivery of genetic material, ensuring precision in addressing problematic cells without affecting healthy ones.\n\n* **Broad Therapeutic Pipeline:** Beyond muscle growth, Oisín has shown the ability to selectively clear senescent cells in mice and ablate adipocytes in human tissue explants, positioning it as a comprehensive solution for age-related conditions.\n\n* **Proven Preliminary Results:** Early studies have shown significant results, such as mice treated with their follistatin therapy showing a 50% increase in size and a 100% increase in strength compared to controls.\n\n* **Traction:** Oisin has already sold a license option of its follistatin application to a large pharmaceutical company providing further validation of the approach and existing preclinical data. If successful in human trials and subsequent regulatory approval, this therapy could become available within the next five years.\n\n* **Market Opportunity:** With sarcopenia-related healthcare costs in the U.S. already at $18.5B in 2020 and rising, Oisín's follistatin-based therapy, combined with exclusive rights to the Fusogenix technology, positions the company to capture a portion of this market. This may offer a revenue stream where previous pharmaceutical efforts have been unsuccessful.\n\n* **Strong IP Position:** With broad exclusive rights to the Fusogenix PLV patent portfolio and several patents related to specific cargos and therapeutic applications, Oisín stands protected against competition.\n\n## Risks\n\n* **Manufacturing Challenges for Follistatin and Myostatin Therapies:** Historically, the biotech industry has struggled with producing follistatin and myostatin-targeted therapies at scale. While Oisín's Fusogenix PLV platform promises to overcome these challenges, the actual large-scale production may present unforeseen difficulties, potentially affecting the timeline for therapy availability and cost-effectiveness.\n\n* **Regulatory Hurdles:** Oisín's Fusogenix PLV platform introduces a new paradigm in genetic material delivery. The safety of genetic therapies, not to mention Oisín’s novel delivery mechanism, may be subject to regulatory scrutiny and rigorous evaluation, especially in regions where genetic medicine policies are still being formulated or updated.\n\n* **Competitive Landscape:** As Oisín focuses on genetic medicines for sarcopenia and senescent cell clearance, they face competition from other biotechs targeting the same pathways or using alternative methods. The race to develop effective follistatin and myostatin-targeted therapies has seen multiple entrants, and Oisín's Fusogenix PLV platform, while unique, will need to demonstrate superiority in efficacy, safety, and scalability to maintain a competitive edge.\n\n* **Potential Side Effects:** While showing promise in preliminary studies, Oisín’s technology is still in the investigational stage. As with all genetic therapies, there's a possibility of unforeseen side effects emerging during later-stage clinical trials. These could arise from the targeted delivery of genetic material or the induced cellular responses, potentially impacting the therapy's broader applicability and acceptance.\n\n## Bibliography\n\n1.

      "content": "*One-liner:* Oisín Biotechnologies is a multi-asset longevity biotech company pioneering genetic medicines to combat sarcopenia and other age-related diseases to promote healthier, longer lives.\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG team\n\n* **Senior Reviewers:** 2 scientists, 1 pharma professional, 1 VC, 1 biotech entrepreneur\n* **Shepherd:** Eleanor Davies\n* **Other squad members:** Paolo Binetti, Ryan Spangler, Tuan Dinh\n\n## Project PI:\n* **Matthew Scholz, CEO & Co-founder**\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nOisin Biotechnologies is a company dedicated to developing genetic medicines that address a range of age-related diseases. Their lead candidate aims to build muscle without exercise, which could be used as a therapy to make older people stronger. The company has assets that selectively kill adipocytes and senescent cells which are believed to play a significant role in the aging process and the onset of age-related diseases. Oisin has generated in-vivo data and has already licensed its technology to pharmaceutical companies.\n\nBy leveraging their royalty-free licence to Entos’ Fusogenix Proteo-Lipid Vehicle (PLV) platform, Oisín aims to deliver specific genes to alter cell behavior, or in the case of problematic cells, inducing apoptosis and thereby rejuvenating tissues or improving physical function.\n\nThis delivery system is not only safer and more cost-effective than other prevalent systems such as viral approaches, but also ensures consistent and reproducible outcomes. If successful in human trials and upon regulatory approval, this therapy could be a game-changer in the longevity and age-related disease market, potentially becoming available within the next five years.\n\n## Problem\n\nAs the global population ages, the prevalence of age-related diseases, particularly those linked to physical frailty are on the rise. Physical strength is incredibly important. In more extreme cases, a person in a wheelchair or bedridden is effectively living on borrowed time. If they do not get out soon, they may never get out at all. Conversely, robust physical strength allows for greater activity and exercise, improved mobility, enhanced social interactions and higher quality of life. Increased muscle mass improves metabolism, strengthens bone, protects against injury. The challenge lies in maintaining muscle mass in aging populations, particularly following injury, sickness, or surgery. Current interventions are largely limited to diet and exercise.\n\nOisín has identified physical frailty as a key target for therapeutic intervention. By directly increasing skeletal muscle mass and physical strength they aim to not only treat but potentially prevent a myriad of age-related conditions, improving healthspan and potentially even lifespan. Pharmaceutical companies have attempted to make therapeutics that target this pathway for years but have failed to solve the manufacturing challenges needed to produce them at scale. Oisín’s approach, rooted in advanced genetic medicine, offers a promising solution in a field that would be both scalable and cost effective.\n\n## Solution\n\nOisín's cutting-edge technology is designed to deliver DNA and RNA with unparalleled distribution and safety at an unprecedented cost and scale. Using their Fusogenix Proteo-Lipid Vehicle (PLV) platform, they can deliver specific nucleic acid cargos to cells across the body that alter the cells behavior, such as making it produce a therapeutic protein, or in the case of unwanted cells causing them to die via apoptosis or other programmed cell death pathways.\n\nPreliminary results from their research have been promising. For combatting frailty, they’ve observed marked increases in muscle size and physical strength from a single treatment. In the case of fat removal, they have shown selective reduction in adipocytes and with their senolytic they've observed a marked reduction in markers of senescence and a noticeable improvement in health parameters and lifespan of treated animals. This approach to genetic medicines enables entirely new therapies that hold immense promise for treating age-related diseases and potentially extending healthy lifespan.\n\nOisín has already demonstrated it can vastly improve physical strength in mice, selectively clear senescent cells in mice (resulting in improved lifespan and healthspan), and selectively ablate adipocytes in human tissue explants. They have performed tolerability studies in nonhuman primates at doses far higher than are expected to be used in humans. Importantly, their PLV platform has already made it through Phase II human trials in a COVID vaccine with no safety signals. To accomplish this, they had to demonstrate the ability to manufacture PLV-based therapies at human scale.\n\n![|602x317](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JZUyc83ItOuNJx5KTTxQZb3rsOFzEF3lPNQw81Iv9HtE-suHk1NHz3ElRJg3H_YBQ19cIJQfKlg8q5zETdMACE7s-Smlo6vU0x_CW9cSvxDX5e40b2jHLMWap2KKkVbIIBf6eCXPpOfPIkZEDxYC5_c)\n\n![|602x317](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/x9nQaNefDs2uaHt1vY60tBJis4RST9e8TI1su2xghFRVqp-MK--lZk1tXnMU5KYNBx8kf1PdHLudUwHUjczKh6SZgE6TJxtHSjXbcczies7AYwom7Fbvd3RUCf1kwxAo9evjEJtT5PUeo9aW6B-WKqI)\n\n![|602x317](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/J_yKfr93iuZo33Rl3KMcKVMUyTTpAmzSm2_7zHbUiCj-_C1wNf0U_zl1GyW8PVsORvGEvBBx2big4psMmhvfALVC2KPHqguaQ6f1sYyMiCc-7eutdOaZJswnK2ZfLdFRah1erPs9PqUAYYRsVcOet5Y)\n\n![|602x316](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/P5hMgZEEYNSK4HaWUnRa9fu9wd09x5zsQd6vWZxxYrDSG_9E96IxmMC7fH5pajiF4k1JU0Ep-zyiTZk7H842flC7cngO16zEkfD4HQoEwSLDuJq_JqOmFYCoiy4LrH4JquLZpgWkzRiuIxP_enrwlY0)\n\n![|602x335](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RfI-n-WHJ0ItxE9vAZZSfCSrfdopUIbqKCl8-MS9P-hw2JtSu1vdtF_YCdytMeA2IeWiKTGU-c2ukur4zlH32JLRRV_HJvBzgqA5gkKVnv8yR2rd6mQfo8ttZJTUyWaYEb7miiccD5grNe5nLYaqKHw)\n\n![|602x317](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lwG8tQWR1A1_0ZFFdmGfTbQwGaL8n3QRNbQz9GqD8bv_79ILiu8yjh-N60Z4blAB4Py6Zo9q3PZluttizn2od4IfEdanqmk0rB_KBtXAEM6B5S_dEA34VqM7jFHel0MGNvVlhkN-ysY6NbiXoDu-31E)\n\n![|602x316](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/fWgzuALiEsI2DeeHMjV-D9BrYDXPRvg4v2VA6hHtdOkiisrb13j94J-8leuAaO1G9OEc9av19cIMeCmBwb2TTgqnaXOAhRw9j5DzyCohQkRrtW1fsMUumAE_Yvnm23ZcEn3AU3NP3YFdvovrFIoKHsQ)\n\n## Opportunity\n\nIn 2020 there were ≈36M patients in the U.S. over the age of 60 with moderate to severe sarcopenia.

Increasing physical strength improves healthspan by facilitating greater activity levels, improved metabolic function, and higher quality of life. Increased muscle mass leads to increased bone density and protects against injury. Others have even recently published that follistatin gene therapies can even extend lifespan in animals.\n\nBeyond follistatin, Oisín has a robust pipeline and is positioning itself to become a large pharmaceutical company focused on healthspan and longevity. Their initial focus on validated targets and FDA-centric endpoints is designed to allow for early licensing deals with large pharmaceutical companies. The objective is to bring in enough revenue with these deals to take their own therapies to approval and eventually even commercialization. Their IP position is broad enough to facilitate product development far into the future and capitalize on new science as it emerges.\n\n## IP Roadmap\n\nOisín Biotechnologies has been proactive in protecting its IP pipeline. They have broad exclusive rights to the Fusogenix PLV patent portfolio and hold several patents related to their specific cargos and therapeutic applications. They continue to file new applications as they develop them and have rights to improvements of the PLV delivery technology. This robust IP portfolio positions them well against competitors and ensures they can capitalize on their innovations.\n\n![|602x320](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/igAWNJTqdEPrErkiQjqsbeo82nKRgJ73tGeXuh6tc2YLfskfChXAfL94nVNlhepDlx8taFNs211o4n3BKjopsBCiCVxH14A0V4VWPz3-lp3kQ8YzDOD6ZRRz4RRnmevqNk8EmDrYq-Tu8Tgwv_KZ5i0)\n\n![|602x319](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xHgY3MLOa2E03BB_9svibRzCdRogSSv_YgIOrWlEjJcetdaIUICHtGikjC3pWzoTrwWM-LYTKSCsyCitwmD-8PA8SlhVaqSQAfZUn1zAwhcYSbKQNE5OlKljZNsMq8GuiWX055M2UDvwEqp6rVxSZug)\n\n![|602x316](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cND93fV_O5p-t9GeSa0U9HZA6Om570i4543EDx-TuPWsWr5Ib9f8mwmFh_BZTrQnITIU-HJJIZzW0xhCQKQLWTq0WD0fN15iP5t6I8wE2MTx6UL7-JLo4kHmtgyt9cXNSuvswu2pgFmk4UgXQPN4VcM)\n\nAs they continue their research and development, it is expected that Oisín will further expand its IP holdings, ensuring a dominant position in the longevity biotech sector.\n\n## Budget\n\n**12 Month Budget:**\n\n* Research and Development: $1,666,229\n* Payroll and Related Expense: $1,715,063\n* Consulting: $349,013\n* Lab Rent & Insurance: $166,713\n* Legal: $106,015\n* Intellectual Property: $383,045\n* General and Administrative: $232,624\n\n**Total: $4,618,702**\n\n## Financing and VitaDAO Funding Terms\n\nOisín Biotechnologies is actively seeking funding to propel their research forward.

      "content": "One-liner: Creating therapeutics to slow down human aging and eliminate root causes of age-related diseases\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG team\n\nSenior reviewers: 1 scientist, 1 biotech manager, 1 biotech entrepreneur, 1 pharma consultant\n\nShepherd: Todd White\n\nOther squad members: Eleanor Davies, Alex Dobrin\n\nSourced by: Alex Dobrin\n\nProject Leads: Peter Fedichev, Alex Kadet\n\n## Summary:\n\nGERO’s mission is to double human health- and lifespan within the current generation. To achieve that goal, the company trained a Large generative Model of human Health (LMH) on a large dataset of longitudinal, real-world medical histories. The model can predict future health outcomes similarly to how Large Language Models (LLMs) anticipate the next word in a sentence. However, unlike LLMs, GERO’s models are physics-based and fully interpretable, revealing the relationship between the aging process and diseases.\n\nGERO’s research reveals that aging is a process governed by the accumulation of entropy (random, stochastic damage), and the laws of physics dictate that processes governed by entropy are technically irreversible. While numerous biotechs and academic labs are attempting to reverse the impacts of aging, GERO instead focuses on the one variable of aging that can be altered without violating the laws of physics: the speed of aging.\n\nThe company’s moonshot program is to identify the major druggable sources of this entropic damage and to develop clinically relevant therapeutics which will significantly slow down the aging process itself.\n\n## Background\n\nHuman aging, a multifaceted and intricate process, has been a focal point of scientific research for generations. GERO, with its pioneering approach, stands at the intersection of this research, offering a fresh perspective on understanding and addressing aging. The company has identified and quantified two distinct aging phenotypes in humans: Frailty (Late-life phenotype) and True Aging (Whole-life phenotype). By doing so, GERO's platform simplifies the complexities associated with aging, providing a clearer roadmap for interventions.\n\nThis approach allows for the development of targeted strategies that can address multiple age-associated conditions simultaneously. As the longevity market seeks innovative solutions to extend healthspan and counteract the effects of aging, GERO's contributions are both timely and relevant. Their platform, rooted in rigorous scientific research, offers a promising avenue for those aiming to mitigate the challenges posed by aging and age-related diseases.\n\n## Problem\n\nAging, an inherent process in humans, leads to diminished physiological and cognitive capacities which culminate in the onset of numerous chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease and osteoporosis. These diseases not only compromise the quality of life in later years, but also pose a strain on global healthcare systems.\n\nThere is a pressing need for innovative tools, particularly those leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to decode the complexities of aging, identify systemic causes, and pave the way for interventions that can mitigate or reverse age-related decline. While the influx of biological data from genomics, proteomics, and other disciplines provide invaluable insights into aging, there remains a pronounced gap in the tools equipped to fully exploit this data. Conventional analytical methods fall short in analyzing vast, multidimensional datasets. Moreover, all age-related diseases are interlinked via aging process which significantly constrains drug discovery against them. GERO’s model emphasizes the irreversible nature of aging while highlighting the reversible aspects of diseases, distinguishing the two phenomena.\n\n## Solution\n\nGERO offers a platform that employs AI and ML to analyze the vast datasets from genomics, proteomics, and related disciplines. It connects the conventional approach of studying biology at a cellular level with a macroscopic perspective, examining organism-level phenotypes across the human lifespan.\n\nBy integrating real-world data-derived Large Model of Health (LHM) with rich molecular data (such as whole-exome sequencing), GERO has unveiled novel treatments for chronic age-related diseases both in-house and in collaborations with pharmaceutical companies.\n\nTheir strategy not only aims to decelerate the aging process but also targets the foundational causes of multiple diseases, presenting a comprehensive approach to age-related health issues. As an example, please see their announcement of research collaboration against fibrosis-related diseases with Pfizer.\n\nTo drive the multifold increase in clinical trial success against age-related diseases, GERO is dedicated to delivering therapeutics which will potentially; 1. Work regardless of patient age, 2. Target only reversible conditions, 3. Ensure that the effect can be obtained in a time frame of a clinical trial.\n\n## Opportunity\n\nGERO’s mission is to ‘radically slow down human aging’. Their technology, is summarised into the following bullet points:\n\nInnovative Approach: GERO's platform originates from the physics of complex systems and real-world human data. This unique combination allows for a more holistic understanding of aging and disease.\n\nTargeted Interventions: GERO's platform identifies genetic pathways that need modification to address the root cause of multiple diseases simultaneously.\n\nOvercoming Biases: GERO's hypothesis-free approach allows for the clustering of diseases with shared underlying biology, overcoming traditional scientific biases.\n\nDrug Development: GERO has a robust drug development pipeline, with interventions targeting various disease clusters, including senescence, fibrotic diseases, and true aging.\n\nProven Results: Preliminary results, such as their immuno-senolytic asset, have shown significant improvements in lifespan and reduction of senescence markers in old mice.\n\n![|602x200](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8kokHeT8yNPLJ9UvprYAyDTvyF0QY8Edblxli27OHsfcvOrCJW-NjRacBWqBwnrpcs2oBsZLCLshxRXwP5ftRasCQTq9g0wl-hLtJ66USiDGXhuRfogYZm6guC0sWg4WvGvxLI4Ipe4Xhcgr8B0rpP4)\n\nDrug Development Pipeline:\n\n![|602x297.2001109745949](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LfRsT14_cIkmk_rvPdqgX-Gmq9RRaHRNG4O15HKdvZpi1Yf1Ugej3V-QdRb4oqX76JGZ0kU8K8jgEFQBQsLlxEB-O-IDQjQrlH9uR-6C9BpkGPTj9pdOGQOS86S-iCJxDvGP3XW1_MRJ8vBU4HZIX70)\n\n## Relevance to Longevity:\n\nGERO's mission directly aligns with the goals of longevity research. By targeting the root causes of aging, GERO's interventions have the potential to extend healthspan, reduce the onset of age-related diseases, and improve overall quality of life.\n\n## Team\n\nGERO’s multidisciplinary team has over 10+ years of experience in computationally-enabled small molecule discovery.

Longevity Biotech Gero Entered a Research Collaboration with Pfizer to Discover Potential Targets for Fibrotic Diseases https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/longevity-biotech-gero-entered-research-collaboration\n\n## Senior Review Digest - Quantitative\n\nBelow is the average scores out of 5 per category from 4 reviewers, who all recommended that the project should be advanced for community feedback.\n\n### Average Scores\n\n* Novelty 4.3\n* Feasibility 2.8\n* Relevance 4.3\n* Science Team 4\n* Market Advantage 3\n* IP Potential 2.5\n* **Conviction Score 3.1**\n\n## Senior Review Digest - Qualitative\n\n### Review 1\n\nGERO offers an interesting approach, but I would structure the funding for specific compounds and get a better deal. The valuation is too high for the current stage of development.\n\n### Review 2\n\nThe strongest aspect of the project is the PI, Peter Fedichev. In my mind, he is one of the smartest people in the longevity space. So I would bet on him to achieve any goal. The weakness is that there is no clear plan on what is the best strategy to commercialize or how their R&D platform develops novel chemical matter/IP/PreclinicalPackage for a classical drug discovery approach.\n\n### Review 3\n\nIn summary, weighing the upside potential, the pros and cons of this opportunity, I overall recommend funding this project. At this point, VitaDAO has not funded a physics-based ML platform trained on large and highly relevant data sets. Therefore, Gero complements the current portfolio. In addition, there have been remarkable exits in the drug related AI/ML field. Yet, my conviction score is lower compared to other opportunities that I have reviewed.\n\n### Review 4\n\nFor future rounds of investments, I would suggest they provide more data to back up their platform. Moreover, the compound for Batten's disease should be left out of investor materials or it should be clear that it was not found through this platform. Otherwise I do hope this project will turn out to be a success, as it is off to a great start with their current pharma partnerships and potential future ones.",

      "content": "One-liner: Creating therapeutics to slow down human aging and eliminate root causes of age-related diseases\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG team\n\nSenior reviewers: 1 scientist, 1 biotech manager, 1 biotech entrepreneur, 1 pharma consultant\n\nShepherd: Todd White\n\nOther squad members: Eleanor Davies, Alex Dobrin\n\nSourced by: Alex Dobrin\n\nProject Leads: Peter Fedichev, Alex Kadet\n\n## Summary:\n\nGERO’s mission is to double human health- and lifespan within the current generation. To achieve that goal, the company trained a Large generative Model of human Health (LMH) on a large dataset of longitudinal, real-world medical histories. The model can predict future health outcomes similarly to how Large Language Models (LLMs) anticipate the next word in a sentence. However, unlike LLMs, GERO’s models are physics-based and fully interpretable, revealing the relationship between the aging process and diseases.\n\nGERO’s research reveals that aging is a process governed by the accumulation of entropy (random, stochastic damage), and the laws of physics dictate that processes governed by entropy are technically irreversible. While numerous biotechs and academic labs are attempting to reverse the impacts of aging, GERO instead focuses on the one variable of aging that can be altered without violating the laws of physics: the speed of aging.\n\nThe company’s moonshot program is to identify the major druggable sources of this entropic damage and to develop clinically relevant therapeutics which will significantly slow down the aging process itself.\n\n## Background\n\nHuman aging, a multifaceted and intricate process, has been a focal point of scientific research for generations. GERO, with its pioneering approach, stands at the intersection of this research, offering a fresh perspective on understanding and addressing aging. The company has identified and quantified two distinct aging phenotypes in humans: Frailty (Late-life phenotype) and True Aging (Whole-life phenotype). By doing so, GERO's platform simplifies the complexities associated with aging, providing a clearer roadmap for interventions.\n\nThis approach allows for the development of targeted strategies that can address multiple age-associated conditions simultaneously. As the longevity market seeks innovative solutions to extend healthspan and counteract the effects of aging, GERO's contributions are both timely and relevant. Their platform, rooted in rigorous scientific research, offers a promising avenue for those aiming to mitigate the challenges posed by aging and age-related diseases.\n\n## Problem\n\nAging, an inherent process in humans, leads to diminished physiological and cognitive capacities which culminate in the onset of numerous chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease and osteoporosis. These diseases not only compromise the quality of life in later years, but also pose a strain on global healthcare systems.\n\nThere is a pressing need for innovative tools, particularly those leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to decode the complexities of aging, identify systemic causes, and pave the way for interventions that can mitigate or reverse age-related decline. While the influx of biological data from genomics, proteomics, and other disciplines provide invaluable insights into aging, there remains a pronounced gap in the tools equipped to fully exploit this data. Conventional analytical methods fall short in analyzing vast, multidimensional datasets. Moreover, all age-related diseases are interlinked via aging process which significantly constrains drug discovery against them. GERO’s model emphasizes the irreversible nature of aging while highlighting the reversible aspects of diseases, distinguishing the two phenomena.\n\n## Solution\n\nGERO offers a platform that employs AI and ML to analyze the vast datasets from genomics, proteomics, and related disciplines. It connects the conventional approach of studying biology at a cellular level with a macroscopic perspective, examining organism-level phenotypes across the human lifespan.\n\nBy integrating real-world data-derived Large Model of Health (LHM) with rich molecular data (such as whole-exome sequencing), GERO has unveiled novel treatments for chronic age-related diseases both in-house and in collaborations with pharmaceutical companies.\n\nTheir strategy not only aims to decelerate the aging process but also targets the foundational causes of multiple diseases, presenting a comprehensive approach to age-related health issues. As an example, please see their announcement of research collaboration against fibrosis-related diseases with Pfizer.\n\nTo drive the multifold increase in clinical trial success against age-related diseases, GERO is dedicated to delivering therapeutics which will potentially; 1. Work regardless of patient age, 2. Target only reversible conditions, 3. Ensure that the effect can be obtained in a time frame of a clinical trial.\n\n## Opportunity\n\nGERO’s mission is to ‘radically slow down human aging’. Their technology, is summarised into the following bullet points:\n\nInnovative Approach: GERO's platform originates from the physics of complex systems and real-world human data. This unique combination allows for a more holistic understanding of aging and disease.\n\nTargeted Interventions: GERO's platform identifies genetic pathways that need modification to address the root cause of multiple diseases simultaneously.\n\nOvercoming Biases: GERO's hypothesis-free approach allows for the clustering of diseases with shared underlying biology, overcoming traditional scientific biases.\n\nDrug Development: GERO has a robust drug development pipeline, with interventions targeting various disease clusters, including senescence, fibrotic diseases, and true aging.\n\nProven Results: Preliminary results, such as their immuno-senolytic asset, have shown significant improvements in lifespan and reduction of senescence markers in old mice.\n\n![|602x200](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/8kokHeT8yNPLJ9UvprYAyDTvyF0QY8Edblxli27OHsfcvOrCJW-NjRacBWqBwnrpcs2oBsZLCLshxRXwP5ftRasCQTq9g0wl-hLtJ66USiDGXhuRfogYZm6guC0sWg4WvGvxLI4Ipe4Xhcgr8B0rpP4)\n\nDrug Development Pipeline:\n\n![|602x297.2001109745949](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LfRsT14_cIkmk_rvPdqgX-Gmq9RRaHRNG4O15HKdvZpi1Yf1Ugej3V-QdRb4oqX76JGZ0kU8K8jgEFQBQsLlxEB-O-IDQjQrlH9uR-6C9BpkGPTj9pdOGQOS86S-iCJxDvGP3XW1_MRJ8vBU4HZIX70)\n\n## Relevance to Longevity:\n\nGERO's mission directly aligns with the goals of longevity research. By targeting the root causes of aging, GERO's interventions have the potential to extend healthspan, reduce the onset of age-related diseases, and improve overall quality of life.\n\n## Team\n\nGERO’s multidisciplinary team has over 10+ years of experience in computationally-enabled small molecule discovery.

Salzman, M.D - Drug Development Advisor\n\nFounder of Inotek Pharmaceuticals, licensed technology to Genentech in a $600 million deal and successfully underwent an IPO\n\n## Slide deck\n\nSlide Deck: link to deck https://docsend.com/view/rj7xi2c9fy7sm8u8\n\n## Financing and VitaDAO Funding Terms\n\nGERO has reserved $100k for the VitaDAO community in its current fundraise to support their ongoing research and drug development efforts. These funds will be instrumental in advancing GERO's mission and bringing their revolutionary treatments to the forefront of medical science.\n\nWith this round of funding, their key milestones will be:\n\n1. Validate the platform in in-vivo experiments in Pfizer’s hands and potentially extend the collaboration.\n\n2. To get at least one more deal with another top-5 pharmaceutical company (active negotiations).\n\n3. To obtain an in-vivo proof of concept that True Aging phenotype can be not only measured, but also modified with an intervention.\n\n4. To raise $30M+ in the next financing round . This will enable the development of pipeline assets that build towards radically slowing down human aging.\n\n## Highlights\n\nGaining Science and Business traction: GERO has forged research collaborations with industry giants like Pfizer Inc., applying its machine learning technology platform to discover novel therapeutic targets directly within human data. This AI-driven approach addresses Pharma efficiency challenges, facilitating faster drug development, rapid identification of new indications, early pipeline diversification, and the discovery of innovative therapeutic modalities. GERO’s unique integration of physics and biotechnology opens doors for partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies, research institutions, and tech powerhouses, amplifying its R&D capabilities.\n\nExpansion into New Therapeutic Areas: While aging remains a central focus, GERO’s platform holds the potential to venture into other therapeutic areas, which can diversify the company's research portfolio and its potential revenue streams.\n\nGlobal Market Reach: Addressing the universal complexities of aging, GERO stands on the cusp of a vast global market. Successful breakthroughs can position the company as a trailblazer in the longevity sector, with potential outreach for a worldwide audience.\n\n## Risks\n\nEvolution of AI-driven Drug Discovery: The rapid pace of technological advancements in AI and biotech means that today's cutting-edge solutions might become obsolete tomorrow. Keeping up with these advancements and continuously updating their platform will be crucial.\n\nRegulatory Challenges: Navigating the complex regulatory landscape for drug discovery and approval can be daunting. Delays or failures in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals can hinder the company's progress and market entry.\n\nData Privacy and Security: Handling vast amounts of personal and medical data comes with significant privacy concerns. Any breach or misuse of this data can lead to legal repercussions and damage the company's reputation.\n\nCompetition and Market Saturation: The AI-driven drug discovery space is becoming increasingly competitive. New entrants or breakthroughs by competitors can impact GERO's market share and potential profitability.\n\n## Conclusion:\n\nGERO's innovative approach to human aging and chronic diseases presents a unique opportunity for VitaDAO to support pioneering research with the potential for significant societal impact.

Longevity Biotech Gero Entered a Research Collaboration with Pfizer to Discover Potential Targets for Fibrotic Diseases https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/longevity-biotech-gero-entered-research-collaboration\n\n## Senior Review Digest - Quantitative\n\nBelow is the average scores out of 5 per category from 4 reviewers, who all recommended that the project should be advanced for community feedback.\n\n### Average Scores\n\n* Novelty 4.3\n* Feasibility 2.8\n* Relevance 4.3\n* Science Team 4\n* Market Advantage 3\n* IP Potential 2.5\n*  **Conviction Score 3.1**\n\n## Senior Review Digest - Qualitative\n\n### Review 1\n\nGERO offers an interesting approach, but I would structure the funding for specific compounds and get a better deal. The valuation is too high for the current stage of development.\n\n\n### Review 2\n\nThe strongest aspect of the project is the PI, Peter Fedichev. In my mind, he is one of the smartest people in the longevity space. So I would bet on him to achieve any goal. The weakness is that there is no clear plan on what is the best strategy to commercialize or how their R&D platform develops novel chemical matter/IP/PreclinicalPackage for a classical drug discovery approach.\n\n### Review 3\n\nIn summary, weighing the upside potential, the pros and cons of this opportunity, I overall recommend funding this project. At this point, VitaDAO has not funded a physics-based ML platform trained on large and highly relevant data sets. Therefore, Gero complements the current portfolio. In addition, there have been remarkable exits in the drug related AI/ML field. Yet, my conviction score is lower compared to other opportunities that I have reviewed.\n\n### Review 4\n\nFor future rounds of investments, I would suggest they provide more data to back up their platform. Moreover, the compound for Batten's disease should be left out of investor materials or it should be clear that it was not found through this platform. Otherwise I do hope this project will turn out to be a success, as it is off to a great start with a partnership with Pfizer and potential ones with Chugai and Novartis.",

      "content": "One-liner: Creating therapeutics to slow down human aging and eliminate root causes of age-related diseases\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG team\n\nScientific evaluation: [To be completed after Senior Review - Phase 2]\n\nBusiness evaluation: [To be completed after Review - Phase 2]\n\nShepherd: @Taliskermalt \n\nOther squad members: @gweisha, @alexdobrin \n\nSourced by: @alexdobrin \n\nProject Leads: Peter Fedichev, Alex Kadet\n\n## Summary:\n\nGERO’s mission is to double human health- and lifespan within the current generation. To achieve that goal, the company trained a Large generative Model of human Health (LMH) on a large dataset of longitudinal, real-world medical histories. The model can predict future health outcomes similarly to how Large Language Models (LLMs) anticipate the next word in a sentence. However, unlike LLMs, GERO’s models are physics-based and fully interpretable, revealing the relationship between the aging process and diseases.\n\nGERO’s research reveals that aging is a process governed by the accumulation of entropy (random, stochastic damage), and the laws of physics dictate that processes governed by entropy are technically irreversible. While numerous biotechs and academic labs are attempting to reverse the impacts of aging, GERO instead focuses on the one variable of aging that can be altered without violating the laws of physics: the speed of aging.\n\nThe company’s moonshot program is to identify the major druggable sources of this entropic damage and to develop clinically relevant therapeutics which will significantly slow down the aging process itself.\n\n## Background\n\nHuman aging, a multifaceted and intricate process, has been a focal point of scientific research for generations. GERO, with its pioneering approach, stands at the intersection of this research, offering a fresh perspective on understanding and addressing aging. The company has identified and quantified two distinct aging phenotypes in humans: Frailty (Late-life phenotype) and True Aging (Whole-life phenotype). By doing so, GERO's platform simplifies the complexities associated with aging, providing a clearer roadmap for interventions.\n\nThis approach allows for the development of targeted strategies that can address multiple age-associated conditions simultaneously. As the longevity market seeks innovative solutions to extend healthspan and counteract the effects of aging, GERO's contributions are both timely and relevant. Their platform, rooted in rigorous scientific research, offers a promising avenue for those aiming to mitigate the challenges posed by aging and age-related diseases.\n\n## Problem\n\nAging, an inherent process in humans, leads to diminished physiological and cognitive capacities which culminate in the onset of numerous chronic diseases, such as Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease and osteoporosis. These diseases not only compromise the quality of life in later years, but also pose a strain on global healthcare systems.\n\nThere is a pressing need for innovative tools, particularly those leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to decode the complexities of aging, identify systemic causes, and pave the way for interventions that can mitigate or reverse age-related decline. While the influx of biological data from genomics, proteomics, and other disciplines provide invaluable insights into aging, there remains a pronounced gap in the tools equipped to fully exploit this data. Conventional analytical methods fall short in analyzing vast, multidimensional datasets. Moreover, all age-related diseases are interlinked via aging process which significantly constrains drug discovery against them. GERO’s model emphasizes the irreversible nature of aging while highlighting the reversible aspects of diseases, distinguishing the two phenomena.\n\n## Solution\n\nGERO offers a platform that employs AI and ML to analyze the vast datasets from genomics, proteomics, and related disciplines. It connects the conventional approach of studying biology at a cellular level with a macroscopic perspective, examining organism-level phenotypes across the human lifespan.\n\nBy integrating real-world data-derived Large Model of Health (LHM) with rich molecular data (such as whole-exome sequencing), GERO has unveiled novel treatments for chronic age-related diseases both in-house and in collaborations with pharmaceutical companies.\n\nTheir strategy not only aims to decelerate the aging process but also targets the foundational causes of multiple diseases, presenting a comprehensive approach to age-related health issues. As an example, please see their announcement of research collaboration against fibrosis-related diseases with Pfizer.\n\nTo drive the multifold increase in clinical trial success against age-related diseases, GERO is dedicated to delivering therapeutics which will potentially; 1. Work regardless of patient age, 2. Target only reversible conditions, 3. Ensure that the effect can be obtained in a time frame of a clinical trial.\n\n## Opportunity\n\nGERO’s mission is to ‘radically slow down human aging’. Their technology, is summarised into the following bullet points:\n\nInnovative Approach: GERO's platform originates from the physics of complex systems and real-world human data. This unique combination allows for a more holistic understanding of aging and disease.\n\nTargeted Interventions: GERO's platform identifies genetic pathways that need modification to address the root cause of multiple diseases simultaneously.\n\nOvercoming Biases: GERO's hypothesis-free approach allows for the clustering of diseases with shared underlying biology, overcoming traditional scientific biases.\n\nDrug Development: GERO has a robust drug development pipeline, with interventions targeting various disease clusters, including senescence, fibrotic diseases, and true aging.\n\nProven Results: Preliminary results, such as their immuno-senolytic asset, have shown significant improvements in lifespan and reduction of senescence markers in old mice.\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/cf8eea2860a9e1c8668c00ed426a3f7ce51c0533.png)\n\nDrug Development Pipeline:\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/bf4175fa7ea6adf193e146f4df66aa22e9d2825e.png)\n\n## Relevance to Longevity:\n\n## GERO's mission directly aligns with the goals of longevity research. By targeting the root causes of aging, GERO's interventions have the potential to extend healthspan, reduce the onset of age-related diseases, and improve overall quality of life.\n\n## Team\n\nGERO’s multidisciplinary team has over 10+ years of experience in computationally-enabled small molecule discovery. Their collective expertise spans across the physics of complex systems to cutting-edge drug discovery methodologies.\n\n## Leadership\n\nPeter Fedichev, PhD - Co-founder & CEO\n\nTheoretical physicist, 10+ years in biotech, expert in aging research and drug design\n\nMax Kholin - Co-founder & COO\n\n15 years of C-level experience in biotech; background in law and finance\n\nAlex Kadet - Chief Business Officer\n\nStrategy & BD executive, 5+ years in biotech; background in management & consulting\n\nY.

      "content": "*One-liner*: Cyclarity Therapeutics is an early stage biotechnology company developing computationally designed novel cyclodextrin drug molecules for the extraction of toxic biomolecules that accumulate with age and are implicated in a variety of age-related conditions including cardiovascular disease, macular degeneration, stroke, and liver failure.\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG Team\n\n* **Senior reviewers**: 3 scientists, 2 biotech managers, 1 biotech entrepreneur, 1 pharma consultant \n* **Shepherd**: Paolo Binetti\n* **Squad members**: Ryan Spangler, Ashish Rajput\n* **Sourced by**: unsolicited application\n\n## Project PI\n\n* **Matthew O’Connor, co-CEO**\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nCyclarity Therapeutics (CTx) engineers cyclodextrin (CD) molecules designed to extract toxic biomolecules that accumulate in cells and tissues as a consequence of aging. Their lead compound targets toxic oxidized cholesterol, which is most heavily associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), but is also implicated in dementia (including Alzheimer’s Disease), liver failure, and macular degeneration. They are also developing a computational platform incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to design novel CD molecules tailored to any target.\n\n## Problem\n\nTheir lead candidate targets possibly the worst of many toxic biomolecules implicated in aging, oxidized cholesterol, and more specifically, 7-ketocholesterol (7KC). 7KC accumulates in cells over time as a result of normal biological processes, and contributes to cellular dysfunction [[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31926618/). The condition most implicated with 7KC is atherosclerosis, with high levels found in plaques and cells that promote plaque development [[2]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22773427/). Collectively, atherosclerotic diseases are by far the world’s biggest killer, contributing to 44% of deaths worldwide (2017 WHO and US Dept. of HHS all-cause mortality risk-adjusted data).\n\nAtherosclerotic lesions consist of dead cells, cholesterols, calcium deposits, and macrophages. Initially, macrophages attempt to clean up the burgeoning lesion through ingestion and removal of accumulating detritus. Upon consumption of the 7KC that is commingled with normal cholesterol and other lipids in the lesions, macrophages become choked with lipids and transform into pro-inflammatory and functionally inactive foam cells.\n\n## Solution\n\nCyclarity’s approach to addressing toxic biomolecules is to develop CDs, carbohydrates with a truncated conical shape, as active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) that bind to these toxins with high affinity and specificity [[3]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33839224/). CDs bind to hydrophobic molecules (such as sterols), thereby conferring solubility to otherwise insoluble molecules. Widely used for industrial and drug delivery applications, CDs have an excellent safety profile: some are GRAS and FDA Inactive Pharmaceutical Ingredient listed, and clinical trials are underway using one CD (Hydroxypropyl-beta-CD, HPBCD) as an API to remove normal cholesterol from children with NPC [[4]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27317368/).\n\nTo develop their lead candidate (UDP-003), they used a combination of computational and wet-lab science to screen hundreds of theoretical and existing CDs and rationally designed a novel class of CDs with high affinity and specificity for 7KC. Their CDs are engineered dimers in a configuration which optimally encapsulate sterols and are modified with substitutions optimized for 7KC binding [[3]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33839224/). With the same computational platform they are also designing CDs to target additional toxins.\n\nTheir data shows that UDP-003 has much higher affinity for 7KC compared to monomeric CDs, and that specificity for 7KC over cholesterol is also excellent [[3]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33839224/),[5]. They found that UDP-003 extracts 7KC from human atherosclerotic vascular tissue and blood cells. Application of UDP-003 to foam cells reverses the accumulation of lipid droplets and returns them to a macrophage-like morphology as shown by Oil Red O staining (Fig 1A). They also found that when UDP-003 is administered to foam cells, phagocytosis activity is increased to close to normal (Fig 1B). This indicates that administration of UDP-003 returns foam cells to both regular macrophage morphology and phagocytic function.\n\n![MoA.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeibbzrlcnwoe6sdwc7vvv3ei6wes7s3sbhq6oa75vqutahd3gqu2je)\n\nPharmacokinetics (PK) studies showed that UDP-003 has a short halflife and high parenteral bioavailability that increased linearly with higher doses. It was found that IP and subcutaneous administration facilitate high bioavailability. The high bioavailability of UDP-003 through subcutaneous administration represents a major advantage, as it shows the viability of a final injectable product.\n\nNon-GLP safety-toxicology experiments have shown that UDP-003 displays acute and repeat dose toxicity only at high doses. GLP ototoxicity has yielded a No Observable Adverse Event Limit (NOAEL) of 650 mg / kg in rats. Their clinical trials plan to test a range of 1-20 mg / kg in humans\n\nCTx is preparing for Phase 1 clinical trials of their lead drug candidate. Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) manufacturing of KGs of UDP-003 has been completed, and general tox studies under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) are underway.\n\n## Opportunity\n\nTheir lead candidate will treat patients with atherosclerosis or at risk, reducing plaque burden and the risk related life-threatening conditions such as CVD, pulmonary, and neurovascular diseases. Coronary Artery Disease is the biggest initial indication they could aim for - and regulatory conditions may be right to request conditional/accelerated approval on the basis of plaque reduction rather than CVD events. This therapeutic also has the potential to treat other conditions related to the accumulation of 7KC and other oxysterols such as Alzheimer’s disease, NAFLD, and COPD. Below we will focus on the atherosclerosis market.\n\nThe financial burden of atherosclerosis is immense, with annual US CVD costs totaling approximately $555B in 2017 and with a projected increase to $1.1T by 2035 [[6]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29632217/). It is projected that the worldwide market for cholesterol mediation drugs to combat atherosclerosis, even with only current non-disease modifying drugs, will reach $37.7B by 2027.\n\nThey have two obvious competitors in the field of developing CDs as APIs: CTD Holdings (Cyclo Therapeutics) and Beren Therapeutics. Both are developing formulations of the well-characterized HPBCD. CTD’s primary indication is for the treatment of NPC disease while Beren is rumored to be targeting familial hypercholesterolemia. Cyclarity has significant advantages over these companies. First, their CDs are ~1000 times more potent than their drugs, which require high doses for efficacy. Second, they have tailored their engineering program to target toxic oxidized cholesterols, while they remain focused solely on bulk cholesterol. Third, they have an IP advantage in that they have patents on new matter.\n\nPharmaceutical targeting of oxidized cholesterol is attracting the attention of other approaches. Both AstraZeneca and Abcentra are developing monoclonal antibody therapeutics for the inhibition of ox-LDL activity. The development of these validates the importance of targeting ox-LDL and other oxidized lipoproteins as treatments for CVD. However, Cyclarity has major advantages over these competing therapeutics. Cholesterol can be oxidized in cells independent of ox-LDL absorption, meaning that targeting ox-LDL will not eliminate 7KC or reverse foam cell formation. Also, the mechanism of UDP-003 is to extract 7KC from cells rather than to block interaction of particles and cells. Blocking the entry of ox-LDLs into cells can prevent further damage, but cannot reverse it. Finally, UDP-003 has zero immunogenicity contrasted with the competing drugs, which are both monoclonal antibodies.\n\nRepair Biotechnologies and Bitterroot Bio also represent competition in targeting atherosclerosis. Repair Biotechnologies, a company already positively assessed by VitaDAO, is developing a cholesterol degrading platform to target cholesterol in atherosclerotic plaques and reduce plaque size. Repair’s approach is elegant and the only clear advantage Cyclarity has is a much easier regulatory path and therefore, despite having started development at about the same time, is almost ready for clinical trials. Repair’s approach may someday be synergistic and complementary to Cyclarity’s approach. Bitterroot Bio is developing a therapeutic to target CD47 which powerfully activates macrophages and may thereby help to clear plaque. The latter could have unforeseen side effects from tampering with a basic cell signaling pathway as has occurred in clinical trials of the same CD47 cancer therapy that has halted clinical trials of essentially the same drug developed by essentially the same group.\n\nAll of these approaches are completely different and revolutionary compared to the current standard of care. One or more of these companies will share in the trillion dollar prize and help save a billion lives in the next 10 years.\n\nOf currently available drug treatments for atherosclerosis, none are disease modifying. Statins and other lipid lowering treatments are good at lowering LDL, but at best only slow atherosclerosis progression. Blood thinners protect against blood clots that can form as a result of atherosclerosis but do nothing to reverse underlying disease.\n\nIt is likely that there will be a liquidity event for investors in approximately 3 years. Demonstration of reduction in coronary plaque volume in ph2 will be major in terms of value. A licensing or acquisition or IPO at that stage, given the market just for CVD briefly outlined above, would run in the billions of dollars in value.\n\n## Relevance to Longevity\n\nCyclarity focuses on removing toxic biomolecules which accumulate in cells and tissues over time due to biological and physical processes over the course of aging. The mechanism of their lead drug is to remove the target oxysterol, rejuvenate foam cells back into functional macrophages, and reduce the plaque build up effects of atherosclerosis. This creates a new and superior approach to treat an extremely common disease associated with aging that causes a substantial decrease in lifespan. As oxidized cholesterol accumulation is a basic damage molecule that accumulates with age in many cells/tissues it is implicated in many diseases of aging [[1]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31926618/).\n\n## IP Roadmap\n\n**First Group: Cyclodextrin dimers, compositions thereof, and uses thereof**\n\n* Broad composition claims expected for the useful set of engineered dimers\n* Priority date Jan 2019; First issue Mar 2022\n* National Stage in US, Europe, Canada, China, India, Japan, Australia, Israel\n* Issued patent in the US. Patent filing date: 1/03/2020; US Patent Publication No. 20200216576.\n\n**Second Group: Cyclodextrin dimers and uses thereof**\n\n* Coverage of new dimer variants and new dimer types\n* Priority date July 2020\n* US and PCT\n\n**Computational Platform (trade secrets) **\n\n* CandymerTM: Cyclodextrin molecular dynamic simulation system\n* Cyclodextrin-Target affinity (Potential of Mean Force) prediction system\n* AI / ML of system\n\n## Experimental Plan\n\nThe full roadmap, summarized in the figure below, consists of three phases, which are described thereafter.\n\n![Plan.jpg](ipfs://bafybeieoitcqzr27pdlbxrxyhay2ktz4lqv4ptlp7ihwvpqrujaorzwuaq)\n\n**Completion of GLP Safety Studies**\n\nThey have begun in vivo GLP studies to ensure that UDP-003 is safe for repeat dose administration in clinical trials. They are preparing a 28-day repeat dose toxicology study in Yucatan swine, as the similarity between the cardiovascular systems of humans and swine can inform safety. This will include a toxicokinetic arm and toxicology assessment. Upon the completion of all GLP studies, the safety of UDP-003 for use in humans will be established and clinical trials can be initiated.\n\n**Initiation of Phase 1 Clinical Trials**\n\nThey are preparing to initiate Ph1 Clinical trials to determine dosing and safety in human patients. This trial will be a traditionally designed SAD/MAD randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to establish safety, PK, and PD parameters in human subjects. Based on recommendations from MHRA, they will be enrolling an arm with atherosclerosis patients in the MAD part of the Ph1 to improve the chances that they obtain patient group-specific safety, PD, and anecdotal efficacy readouts in phase 1 to inform dosing in later phase trials.\n\n**Clinical Phase 2 plan and potential exit**\n\nPh2 will seek to link 7KC target engagement data with plaque reduction efficacy data to allow for evaluation of their overall strategy. Very briefly, the plan is to recruit 500 patients who will be randomized into 3 arms (placebo, low-dose, high dose). The course of treatment will be finalized based on Ph1 data, but will likely be delivered over 3 weeks, with weekly analysis of blood, urine, and physiological measurements. Post treatment monitoring will consist of monthly analysis of blood, urine, and physiological measurements.\n\n## Budget\n\nThe budget for the first two phases of the roadmap above, Completion of GLP Safety Studies and Initiation of Phase 1 Clinical Trials, which are the scope of the current round, is the following:\n* Personnel: $900k\n* Facilities: $100k\n* Business expenses: $150k\n* Lab expenses: $100k\n* Legal: $200k\n* Chemistry/CMC: $500k\n* In vivo: $1M\n* Computational: $100k\n* Regulatory/QA/QC/PM: $300k\n\n**Total: $3.35M**\n\n## Financing and VitaDAO funding terms\n\nCTx completed a Series Seed round in 2019, with a total committed cash investment of $3.95M. The round had three institutional investors, and six angels providing small amounts, and was led by Kizoo Technology Capital GmbH.\n\nCyclarity completed Series Seed II in 2021 with an additional committed cash investment of $10M. Kizoo TCG led the round. Post-money valuation of ~$28M.\n\nCyclarity is currently raising funds for a $3-4M Bridge Round. They have over $3M committed for this round. The bridge round funds will be used for final preparations and initiation of Phase 1 clinical trials. Additional funds will be raised to complete the Ph1 clinical trial. They will need a total of not more than $12M to complete Ph1 (including the bridge round).\n\nCyclarity has allocated 100k for the VitaDAO community in the bridge round under a SAFE agreement with a 15% discount for the line items in the budget.\n\n## Team\n\n**Leadership**\n\n* **Dr. Matthew O'Connor, Co-Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder**: Dr. O'Connor holds a MS in neuroscience from Northwestern Medical in 1999 and a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Baylor College of Medicine in 2005.

      "title": "VDP-90 [Assessment] MutagenTech - Somatic mutation sequencing technology ",
      "content": "## Longevity Dealflow WG team\n* **Scientific and Business evaluation**: 3 venture capitalists, an academic professor, and a start-up founder.\n* **Shepherd**: Ryan Spangler & Paolo Binetti \n* **Other squad members**: Rhys Anderson, Amaury Bekaert, David Wilson, and Ashish Rajput\n\n## Project lead\nChris Bradley, MS, Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Simple Summary\nMutagenTech (a Matter Bioworks Subsidiary): A next-gen sequencing service for somatic mutations discovered in Jan Viig’s lab, a leading geroscience KOL in the DNA damage and repair space.\n\n## Problem\n\nFundamentally, our DNA is the primary source of our entire body’s cellular information. Once our parental DNA fuses to form our own, we then begin the complex journey of unfurling the entire complexity of our organismal dynamics from that single starting point. Naturally, over the course of a lifetime of intrinsic and extrinsic damage, the DNA in our cells inevitably begins to lose its original sequence integrity. This loss of signal takes on many forms, including somatic point mutations, structural variations such as insertions, deletions, and transpositions as well as epigenetic landscape drift.\n \n![1.png](ipfs://bafkreifffdqg6zqtjb6gmg47hqbhuurjkngx6nvu5auinupmlq6jhm6e6a)\n    \nDespite our overall understanding of human genetics, we still do not fully understand how and which of these errors are most affecting the functionality of cells. Outside of some well documented exceptions such as cancer drivers and suppressor mutations, most of these errors do not yet have predictable and clear consequences. The search for a deeper understanding of this mystery is the foundation of the entire field of somatic mutation sequencing.\n\n## Opportunity\n\nRecently, there has been a clear link demonstrated between somatic mutation rate and both organism age and the rate of aging itself (Cagan et al., 2022).\n\n![2.png](ipfs://bafkreiglb7ph5ioxdjy2mlsgqlx2idnrjf7eeqt2kcuokmgx6pf2bg4hzq)\n    \n ![3.png](ipfs://bafkreia3xr3f7yjjaqzsk2d63daklzt7sgz5nklzx5ii453l6euwlzpbwi)\n    \nSomatic mutations have been proposed as a core contributor to aging phenotype through loss of function, increasing transcriptional noise, and promoting clonal expansion. Nevertheless, due to a lack of cheap and accurate somatic sequencing methods, the exact mechanisms for these pathological consequences were not fully examined. Until now.\n\n## Solution\nWith MutagenTech's novel SMM-seq technology, developed in the lab of pioneering somatic mutation geneticist Dr. Jan Vijg PhD (Chair of Genomics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine) they can now detect somatic mutations in a cost-effective manner with higher accuracy than ever before. This technology represents a game-changing catalyst in the field of somatic mutations and will help shed light on how somatic mutations contribute to aging and other pathologies.\n\nThe current golden standard is duplex sequencing, which is much more costly and less accurate than our SMM-sequencing. In addition to comparing both strands, our approach allows us to amplify DNA fragments by making direct, concatenated copies of the primary DNA. This allows us to differentiate sequencing errors from true point mutations, with an accuracy that has been shown to reach the theoretical maximum after 7 copy cycles. Therefore, we can provide the same service as our competitors in a cheaper, better, and faster way.\n\n## Go to Market Strategy\n \n![4.png](ipfs://bafybeiahj7isb7dnrnnsmpu5pwvkx4h4b3rtjitzjloy6coblycy7rs47m)\n   \n* The team has done extensive market research and we have identified clear customer segments as well as competitors in the space.\n* The initial go to market approach is to target labs that already study somatic mutations, since they have already validated the need for the technique.\n* Early clients have also confirmed that the approach is beneficial to them and better than the competition.\n* The company is already receiving revenue from this segment (with over $300k worth of ARR projected to be closed this quarter), the team feels confident in the product/market fit for this market segment.\n* Mid-term, this initial market is relatively small (~$1B) and they are expanding to the pre-clinical genotoxicology market.

      "content": "**One liner** : a first-in-class intervention from an accomplished scientist entrepreneur leveraging tRNA know-how to tackle the most frequent nonsense mutation, relevant for a wide range of diseases and longevity.\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG Team\n\n* **Reviewers** : Senior review started\n\n* **Shepherd** : Paolo Binetti\n\n* **Other squad members** : Eleanor Davies, Tuan Dinh, Eli Mohamed, Tim Peterson\n\n* **Sourced by** : proposed by principal investigator\n\n**VitaDAO Entrepreneur In Residence - Project Manager (EIR PM)**: Anthony Schwartz, Ph.D.\n\n**Principal Investigator (PI)**: Michael Torres, Ph.D.\n\n## Summary\n\nNonsense mutations contribute significantly to a wide range of genetic and age-related diseases by inducing premature stops of protein translation when occurring in coding regions. The most common mutation is from an arginine codon to an opal-stop codon. Dr. Torres, an RNA expert and co-founder of [Recode Tx](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/recode-therapeutics), proposes an engineered suppressor tRNA that can specifically recognize these codons and insert an arginine amino acid in its place, restoring normal protein translation. Delivery can be via be achieved using clinically validated modalities. This technology has promising preliminary results, and several clinical opportunities are possible. A stepwise research plan is outlined to confirm the feasibility and identify the most promising clinical applications.\n\n## Problem\n\nA nonsense mutation is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA or RNA that results in a premature termination codon (PTC) or a nonsense codon, leading to a truncated, incomplete, and nonfunctional protein product.\n\nNonsense mutations cause disease-causing variants in about 10% of patients with genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis. They are also implicated in age-related diseases, like cancer [5, chapter 2].\n\nNonsense mutations at Arginine CGA codons resulting in a nonsense opal stop codon, TGA (one of the three stop codons in the genetic code), with hydrolytic deamination of 5-methylcytosine at CpG sites being the main cause, is the most frequent in tumor suppressor genes [2].\n\nDifferent strategies have been attempted so far to mitigate the effects of nonsense mutations [7, 8]:\n\n* **Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD) Inhibition by Drugs** . NMD is a highly conserved pathway for the surveillance and degradation of abnormal mRNAs, identified based on premature termination codons. Drugs that block NMD can activate PTC readthrough, as is the case for aminoglycosides, such as G418 and NB-124, or PTC-124 (Ataluren). The drawbacks of this approach are low efficiency, the incorporation of near-cognate amino acids at PTC, and readthrough at natural termination codons (NTC), resulting in aberrant protein products and small therapeutic windows.\n\n* **Pseudouridylation** . Unlike NMD inhibition, which targets any PTC, a pseudouridylation drug can be tailored to a specific disease-causing PTC. approach. Unlike aminoglycosides, pseudouridylation raises little concern about global NTC readthrough, but like aminoglycosides, it promotes the misincorporation of near-cognate amino acids.\n\n## Solution\n\n**Arginine Suppressor tRNA**\n\nNonsense mutations can be suppressed by a mutation in the anticodon sequence of a tRNA molecule so that it recognizes the stop codon instead. The figure below shows how such a “suppressor tRNA” works to suppress the effect of the mutation of a glutamine codon into an amber nonsense stop codon.\n\n ![suppress.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeicsac7nov5nzogzstmdwzgbeecumbzbvu6g44mitgj54km6rkrllq)\n    \n**Figure. Mechanism of suppression of a nonsense amber codon [4]**\n\nSimilarly, an opal suppressor tRNA can recognize the premature stop codon caused by a nonsense mutation in the arginine CGA codon, allowing for the incorporation of arginine at that position and the production of a full-length protein.\n\nWhile suppressor tRNAs occur naturally due to mutations, they are detrimental because they imply partial loss of translation capability for a given amino acid, which is lethal in insects and mammals. In addition, naturally-occurring suppressor tRNAs bind with nonsense and normal stop codons, generating longer (and incorrect) versions of many proteins whose genes were never mutated. [4]\n\nWe propose engineered arginine suppressor tRNA capable of specifically targeting nonsense opal codons without competing with normal tRNA.\n\nPreliminary ribosome profiling data were obtained with collaborators at Johns Hopkins that show rescue of TP53 levels in calu6, a cell line with an opal nonsense mutation in the gene (homozygous TP53 R196X), without significant NTC readthrough, performing better than known alternative interventions. See the figure below.\n\n![data.jpg](ipfs://bafkreicgnk6aprca4rn3m7feyde3ejubh56q6zwtl7fvj37nmtxlbez4le)\n    \nIn this experiment, cells were treated with G418 (a drug that significantly causes read-through), Atalruren (or PTC124) (PTC therapeutics readthrough drug), the lysine amber suppressor, and the arginine opal suppressor. The tRNAs were oligos delivered by RNAiMax. The western blot shows that G418 and Arg/Op rescued p53, but G418 had more truncated p53 than Arg/Op suggesting it is not specific. PCT124 failed to rescue p53 in this experiment.\n\nThe graph is a genome-wide ribosomal profiling study using Calu6 cells with the indicated treatments. The degree of right shifting indicates read-through beyond normal stops (into the 3’ UTR). The data demonstrate that G418 reads through normal stops, as does lysine/amber, to a certain extent, while the arg/opal tRNA does not. PTC124 either, but that’s not surprising, given the drug history and our data.\n\n**Drug delivery**\n\nWe are considering both non-viral (e.g., lipid nanoparticles) and viral vectors to deliver the tRNA payloads. Amongst the viral vectors, AAV9 is a promising vector for clinical use due to its ability to efficiently transduce various tissues and organs, including the heart, liver, skeletal muscle, and central nervous system (CNS). AAV9 has been shown to have higher transduction efficiency in the CNS than other AAV serotypes, making it an attractive vector for treating neurological disorders.\n \n![table1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreid4ela4nomovsa75aeedmf3bzkc3jvzbqamhrp64ta3755z2obsmi)\n    \nIn particular, AAV9-based gene therapies have shown promising results in clinical trials for treating SMA, a neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations in the SMN1 gene. AAV9-mediated gene therapy for SMA has been shown to increase the levels of SMN protein and improve motor function in patients.\n\nThus our lead therapeutic approach would be to use AAV9 to deliver an arginine opal suppressor. Given the validity of AAV9, this would enable us to optimize our path to first-in-human studies upon successful generation and validation of lead candidates.\n\nWe could develop an oligo-based approach as a backup.\n\n## Opportunity\n\nThe rate of nonsense mutations among pathologies is variable. However, the gene silencing mechanism occurring due to a nonsense mutation is shared. Consequently, common therapies can be applied to patients with various diseases, with an enormous pipeline-in-a-pill potential, as is characteristic of candidate longevity interventions.\n\nThis potential has attracted several startups that have raised significant investments in recent years, such as, in the tRNA space: Alltrna [10], hC Bioscience, ReCode Therapeutics (co-founded by this project’s PI), Shape Therapeutics, and Tevard [7].\n\nSome of the diseases implicated with nonsense mutations are Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), cystic fibrosis (CF), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), cancer, metabolic diseases, and neurologic disorders.\n\nWe would determine lead indications with in vivo assessments in disease models. At this point, we do not intend to focus on treating a specific disease like SMA but to generate a therapy guided toward globally suppressing arginine opal mutations that occurs in multiple genes in parallel (see table below).\n\n## Relevance for longevity\n\nAn arginine opal suppressor tRNA could be a potential therapy to impact lifespan and age-related diseases. For example, cancer is an underappreciated aging-related disease. Reactivation of tumor suppressor expression due to nonsense suppression would be expected to significantly impact cancer, which would be valuable because cancer is a top cause of mortality worldwide.\n\nAnalysis of human gene transcripts reveals that CGA codons are present in aging, DNA repair, and metabolism genes, e.g., APOE, ATM, TP53, and Lamin A (REF).\n \n![table2.png](ipfs://bafybeicjffbktnxzjisbn6okohz6exm7j4l6rk4mfsoil34pvfjdihzbje)\n    \n## Plan and IP roadmap\n\n### *Phases proposed for funding*\n\n**Milestone 1 – Start of the project – T0**: project kickoff meeting to be organized by PM after on-chain approval of the proposal.\n\n**Phase 1** : Design & generate an arginine opal suppressor construct for use in an AAV9 vector. The rationale for AAV9 is that it is the most clinically validated AAV with the broadest tropism.\n\nRisk mitigation: after the in-vitro data with AAV there could be a decision point to consider different delivery modalities. We can design an arginine opal suppressor as an oligo that could be conjugated or unconjugated to drive desired tropism.\n\n*Each one of these assets could be novel IP and could be selected for further development.*\n\n**Milestone 2 – Go / no go check – T0 + 3 months**: Completion of phase 1 and presentation of results in a dedicated meeting or at a quarterly review.\n\n**Phase 2** : In vitro testing of selected vectors/oligos. Using the Calu6 cell line, which is homozygous for an arginine nonsense mutation in p53 (R196X), we will evaluate activity by assessing the restoration of p53 levels. This evaluation could be performed at a CRO such as Champion’s Oncology.\n\n**Milestone 3 – End of the project – T0 + 6 months**: Completion of phase 2 and presentation of results in a dedicated meeting or at a quarterly review, proposal for next round of funding. Note, a provisional patent could be filed at this stage.\n\n### *Additional phases part of the plan, but not funded*\n\n**Phase 3** : In vivo testing of selected vectors/oligos in relevant age-related/lifespan models. In consultation with VitaDAO, the team would identify relevant disease and lifespan models to test selected vectors/oligos to confirm the efficacy and evaluate the effects of chronic arginine opal suppression.\n\n**Phase 4** : If we see positive results in the in vivo studies, we will pursue further financing to move further into development. Business development relationships would be explored at this time as well.\n\n**Total timeline for activities until the end of phase 3** : see the figure below corresponding to 1 year (caveat: dependent on the in vivo study parameters. If lifespan studies, it could be longer)\n\n![planning.png](ipfs://bafkreibnrihu6rmthpvlzaalsz2kcyhtixxgz3ykkcvys56xstwdllvp6m)\n    \n## Budget\n\nProposed budget for activities:\n\n|Budget item|Cost|\n|---|---|\n|Vector design & production (CRO)|$10,000|\n|Virus production (CRO)|$10,000|\n|In vitro testing (CRO)|$20,000|\n|(*)VitaDAO EIR PM (Anthony Schwartz) $3,000/month (20hrs/month)|$18,000|\n|(*)PI consultant (Michael Torres) $2,500/month (16hrs/month)|$15,000|\n|10% contingency buffer|$8,300|\n|*Total*|*$91,300*|\n\n(*) Up to 6 months or project completion.

      "title": "VDP-109 [Funding]: Web3ification of TLDR longevity research peer review service ",
      "content": "*One liner:* we propose development of the web3 version of TLDR (the decentralized longevity review) to support:\n\n1. content hosting on a production-grade database\n2. web3 login for payment and identity management\n3. upvotes, downvotes, and reputation accrual for authors and reviewers.\n\n## Overview\nPreviously we developed a [web2 version of TLDR - (VDP-53)](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.vitadao.eth/proposal/0x754a0895abb771428e6b7d3c9cccfc236ba8fa882af06a52a0326fbdc2c06102) to enable paid peer reviews of longevity research. There were no costs associated with this as it was developed by Tim Peterson, who coded up the website as a side project paid for by his general role at VitaDAO. The web2 version was useful to demonstrate the functionality and as a marketing tool.\n\nHowever, a web3 version is needed to realize the vision of the project. This project aims to enable researchers to have a better way to build their reputation. We believe this will be facilitated by web3 because of the superior incentive alignment mechanisms that web3 can offer. At a fundamental level, researchers’ reputation is currently tied to their email addresses. Take for example, one having a Harvard email address. If you don’t know the person you can almost immediately know the person performs credible research because of their email address (obvious caveats, but you get the idea). In the web3 world, one’s wallet address should signify that the researcher is important. Individuals’ reputation can be a collection of their activities at several organizations but importantly it is the individual to whom the value of their research output accrues. Not their organizations.\n\nIn terms of implementation, a key goal of this project is to initiate people into logging in with their wallet to replace email login. This will enable creators, in this case peer reviewers, to capture the value they create. Whereas in web2, the value is captured by the platform. One can’t accrue value to one’s email.\n\n## Problem\nThe Longevity Decentralized Review (TLDR) is an on-demand peer review service. The current prototype is live at [https://longevity.review](https://longevity.review). It addresses 5 critical issues with academic journals:\n\n1. Researchers need to obtain peer reviews of their work in a timely and fair fashion.\n2. Researchers should get feedback on their research prior to entering the journal publication cycle.\n3. Reviewers should have the option of compensation for their efforts, especially if they make high quality contributions to the work (as viewed by the research community).\n4. The general public should be able to identify credible research without waiting the often yearslong (yes, plural years) review + publication cycle required by most journals.\n5. Journals should not profit off the free labor of researchers, nor paywall credible research content from the public.\n\nIt is important to note that TLDR does not interfere with the status quo. It is an opt-in mechanism for researchers to get quality feedback on their work and could function as a pre-journal submission screening mechanism.\n\n## Current Solutions\nThe research community has tried to remedy these issues mainly with (1) preprint servers and (2) social media promotion.\n\nPreprint servers host unpublished research for consumption by researchers and the general public. These include BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and Arxiv. They solve the problem of distribution, though they fail to identify credible research and fail to provide researchers with feedback on their work. To reduce this problem, many researchers have made profiles on popular social media sites such as twitter and reddit, and use these profiles to promote their work or work they view as credible. The social mechanisms built into this site—namely likes/upvotes, retweets, comments, and follower/following lists—then provide the public with some basis for identifying credible research.\n\nHowever, these communities are often unfocused and non-uniform. Thus, while social media promotion helps with content discovery, it very rarely provides researchers with high-quality reviews and does not address the problem of reviewer compensation whatsoever.\n\n## TLDR\n### How does TLDR currently work?\nTLDR provides funding for researchers to review each other’s work.\n\nArticles from websites known as “Rxiv” (pronounced “archive”) preprint servers, BioRxiv, MedRxiv, and Arxiv are auto-posted daily to the homepage. These “Rxiv” websites enable anyone to submit their research in the STEM (science, technology, engineering, medicine) disciplines for free. Once users register with email, they can upvote content and write a review by typing in a comment box. Users can search for content or browse the “all” page to find content to review. Authors can make a donation to TLDR to mark their post as “paid,” which incentivises reviewers to prioritize their work.\n\nOn TLDR, the incentive for peer reviewing these freely posted manuscripts is to receive a share of the donations given to TLDR. Additionally, VitaDAO is supplementing the reviewer payments with its $VITA tokens. The initial focus is on longevity related research, but in the future the scope could be expanded to other research areas.\n\nAs of now, TLDR is a product-research prototype that doesn’t support payments nor web3 login. It also doesn’t reorder content based on upvotes received. We propose implementing these features to upgrade TLDR into a real product.\n\n### What we propose to build\n\n**Summary**\nWe propose to build the following infrastructure needed to upgrade TLDR to a fully-functioning product:\n\n* Web3 login for authors and reviewers.\n* A server which will store and host (1) posts in the form of links to preprint papers, (2) reviews on those posts, (3) upvotes/downvotes on both posts and reviews.\n* Payments in $VITA (and possibly USDC) by authors and to reviewers.\n\n**Description**\nReplacing the email login with an Ethereum wallet is a substantial novelty which aligns with VitaDAO’s mission. A connected address natively supports ERC20 transfers, allowing TLDR to compensate researchers with VITA tokens. This serves the dual purpose of (1) compensating reviewers and (2) distributing governance power to knowledgeable contributors with a record of providing high-quality feedback.\n\nA full-fledged site would require a server to store and host reviews associated with papers added to the platform. These posts and reviews can also be uploaded to IPFS, but we believe a traditional database is better suited to task in its current state, since traditional databases offer flexibility and ease of development currently unmatched by IPFS. Of course, additional work can be done to backup any platform content on IPFS if VitaDAO deems this important.\n\nUp and downvotes must also be stored and rendered, since this is what will eventually determine post ordering, will grow reviewer reputation and determine reviewer payouts. This iteration of TLDR distributes VITA to reviewers manually at the discretion of admins (precise criteria/algorithm to be determined in future, we will merely provide a simple tool to assist), so we feel that storing up and downvotes on-chain is unhelpful at this point in time. Doing so would require a smart contract—therefore an audit—so to keep costs down we have left this out of the proposal. As with posts, future work can be done to automatically upload up/downvotes on IPFS.\n\nIn the Additional Possibilities section, we outline additional work directions that have been left out of this proposal. This proposal is deliberately left simple in order to facilitate iterative development and reduce upfront costs to the VitaDAO treasury.\n\n## Timeline and Finances\nWe believe an MVP can be constructed within 2 months of starting work.\n\nThe sources of cost for this work are (1) compensation for contributors, (2) server costs, (3) professional advice on design and implementation. The bulk of development will be conducted by Petros Sideris, Jan Ole Ernst and Kyle Duffy, though we will be seeking the advice of Stefan Adolph and Tim Peterson for their respective engineering and product expertise. Over the 2 month timeline, we expect to pay at most $1000/mo for advice and contributions from Stefan, as well as at most $9000/mo for the remainder of expenses, which includes wages/rewards for 2 developers, and server costs.\n\nWe would like to share risk with VitaDAO by accepting a portion of compensation in VITA tokens. Accordingly, we propose a budget of 10,000 USDC and 5000 VITA per month, making the total maximal cost $20000 and 10000 VITA.\n\n## Additional Possibilities\nThe team would be available to develop additional features with additional funding if VitaDAO believes they are important. Specifically, we have considered the following additional features:\n\n* Mirror database (including posts and up/downvotes) to IPFS with a possibility of streamlining up/downvoting with snapshot.\n* Sybil resistance mechanisms, in the form of (1) staking or (2) linking web2 credentials or other unique identifiers to an Ethereum address (such as your ORCID ID) (details can be provided if requested in the comments, ZK proofs are also an option)\n* Reputation storage on-chain (requires audit)\n* Implement specific reviewer payout tooling\n* Automated payment dispersal to reviewers (based on a smart contract) (requires audit)\n\n**Team:**\n\n*Petros Sideris*.

      "title": "VDP-111: VITA-FAST Governance and Constitution",
      "content": "# VITA-FAST Governance and Constitution\n\n## VITA-FAST Stakeholders\n\nStakeholders include VITA-FAST token holders, VitaDAO, the Korolchuk lab, Newcastle University, Molecule, and any service providers, as well as any other natural or legal persons who consider themselves affected by or otherwise interested in VITA-FAST.\n\n## Members of VITA-FAST Governance\n\nA member is anyone who holds $VITA-FAST, the token to govern the [Korolchuk IP-NFT](https://www.vitadao.com/projects/korolchuk-lab). Tokens can be obtained by purchasing on a DEX or working for the project. Members have full governance rights and can participate in governance on Discord (informally) and via token-based voting (formally).\n\nToken holders are the ultimate authority in what happens with the Korolchuk project via the $VITA-FAST governance token.\n\n## Working Groups and Squads\n\nCurrently, active Working Group streams relevant to VITA-FAST are:\n\n* Longevity Working Group\n* Community & Awareness\n* Operations\n\n* Builder Squad\n\n## Service Providers\n\n* Molecule AG\n  * Molecule Product and Tech WG\n  * Molecule Biotech Program\n\n## Project Stewards\n\nGovernance related to VITA-FAST is supported by a steward and the creation of a governance squad who helps coordinate project related activities and tasks for the project from VitaDAO.\n\n* Stewards execute and make decisions on a day-to-day basis within the bounds empowered by the token holders.\n* A VITA-FAST steward is appointed by VITA-FAST holders\n  * The Builder Squad in VitaDAO may propose a candidate of their choice\n  * Individuals can submit a proposal to run for steward\n  * Elections will be carried out to formally appoint this steward amongst VITA-FAST holders in a subsequent “Project Lead” proposal\n* Stewards can be challenged by VITA-FAST holders, or a new steward suggested\n* The VITA-FAST Steward, can be a member of the commercialization squad / Longevity Dealflow WG within VitaDAO though and act as a conduit for communications between the VitaDAO community as token holder, and the VITA-FAST project.\n\n# Governance Framework\n\nVITA-FAST token holders are in control of all governance decisions by voting on VITA-FAST proposals. Proposals vary by type and follow the process specified below. VITA-FAST members’ votes are weighted by the amount of VITA-FAST tokens they hold.\n\nIn the future, VITA-FAST token holders may delegate votes to members of their choosing and typically will do so to members with more domain expertise.\n\nUS persons will not be allowed to participate in VITA-FAST token governance unless otherwise permitted by law. Purchase of VITA-FAST by US persons is against the VITA-FAST terms.\n\n## Multisig\n\nVITA-FAST uses a Gnosis Safe multisig with four signers, who are trusted individuals voted in by the community. The VITA-FAST multi-sig signers secure the multi-sig and execute the will of the VITA-FAST token holders, as defined by the token holders and Stewards. A request for nominees from amongst existing VITA-FAST token holders may also follow. They are not a decision-making body. The list of signers is as follows:\n\n1. Alex Dobrin (@alexdobrin), Awareness Steward\n2. Eleanor Davies (@eleanord)\n3. Jesse Hudson (@jessehh)\n4. @schmackofant\n\nNote: Alex and Eleanor they are acting in their capacities as caretakers/representatives of VitaDAO, and not in their personal capacities\n\n## Soft Governance\n\nIn principle, as many decisions as possible should be made using a soft governance mechanism via Discord. As a general rule, on-chain votes are required for high-stakes decisions that\n\n* revolve around the treasury and a certain level of expenses\n– ≤ $10,000 USD equivalent\n* revolve around the rules or the rules to change the rules [the constitutional process]\nor\n* revolve around membership and enforcement of norms [punitive measures].\n\nOther decisions should be taken through soft governance.\n\n## Proposal Process Overview\n\n1. Phase I: Informal - Post in VITA-FAST Token-Gated Channel in Discord\n\n→ Community support indicated by Discord vote (5 votes)\n\n2. Phase II: Formal - Creation of thread and discussion with Phase II tag in Discord\n\n→ Community support indicated by Discord vote (20 votes)\n\n3. Phase III: Upload to Snapshot for token-based vote\n\n→ Community support indicated by token-based vote\n\n## Phase 1: Specification on Discord\n\nThis phase requires threads to be created in the VITA-FAST token gated Discord forum channel. This information must be non-confidential.\n\nTitle → 30-60 characters\n\nTeaser → First approx. 120 characters of the content below are shown on the Snapshot main page\n\nSummary → 200-400 characters in one paragraph\n\nDetails → any length, any formatting, should include media and hyperlinks, must include sections on motivation, specification and implementation\n\nIn addition to these fields, Phase 2 proposals must include a single-choice poll on the proposal outcome giving the options “Agree”, “Agree with revisions” (requiring a comment), and “Disagree”.\n\n* Agree\n\n* Agree with revisions (please comment)\n\n* Disagree\n\n[/poll]\n\nThe proposal author is responsible to incorporate comments from “Agree with revisions” votes. If their comment is fully resolved, commenting authors are supposed to change their vote from \"Agree with revisions” to “Agree”.\n\n### Duration\n\nMinimum: 1 day\nMaximum: 1 week\n\n### Passing Requirement\n\nFor proposals to successfully pass from Phase 1 to Phase 2, there must be one outcome with a relative majority of votes on a Discord poll (minimum 10, and majority yes).\n\nPhase 2: Consensus on-chain (Snapshot)\n\nProposals are moved to Phase 2 by posting the proposal to the VITA-FAST snapshot. It will be the responsibility of the multisig signatories to ensure proposals are posted to Snapshot without delay. In addition, the multisig signatories will be responsible for notifying the VITA-FAST token holders via Discord and Telegram ensuring all token holders receive adequate notification.\n\nAdditionally, VITA-FAST holders have the option of assigning their voting power to a delegate on Snapshot.\n\n### Phase 2 Duration\n\n1 day\n\n### Passing Requirement\n\nMajority vote with 5% quorum of circulating token supply via formal token-based vote. Snapshot votes are shielded to prevent voting bias and to combat voter apathy.\n\nIdentical or nearly-identical proposals that do not pass Phase 2 on Snapshot, can be reintroduced right away under certain circumstances.\n\n### Governance Incentives\n\nTo create an incentive program for generating productive governance proposals, VITA-FAST holders who create proposals that are passed on Snapshot will receive a 20 VITA-FAST reward.\n\n## VitaDAO voting on VITA-FAST issues\n\nVitaDAO is able to participate in VITA-FAST governance relative to the circulating supply held by holders other than VitaDAO.\n\nToday, 20% of the supply of VITA-FAST is currently distributed to holders other than VitaDAO. Therefore, VitaDAO can vote with 20% of the VITA-FAST tokens. VitaDAO holds 69% of the VITA-FAST supply equal to 690,000 VITA-FAST. Therefore today VitaDAO would be limited to voting with 200,000 of that VITA-FAST.\n\nVitaDAO and other parties agree to abstain from votes where it is deemed to have a conflict of interest by a third neutral party.\n\n## VITA-FAST Majority Rule and Minority Rights\n\nTo implement a majority-rule for decision-making for VITA-FAST holders, a ⅔ supermajority principle will be put into action for adjudicating IP-NFT licensing contracts. A licensing deal will be deemed approved only if it secures the favor of more than ⅔ of token holders. As such, an approval would drag-along all VITA-FAST token holders to the decision. In addition, to safeguard the interests and prevent extreme dilution of minority token holders, any proposal to augment the quantity of VITA-FAST must also achieve endorsement from over ⅔ of the token holders.",

      "title": "VDP-106 [Governance] Proposal eligibility criteria to enter the VitaDAO deal-flow funnel",
      "content": "## Motivation\n\nThe resources of VitaDAO and applicants are precious. Both should invest time in a proposal only if it has reasonable chances to get funded, which ultimately requires a positive vote by token holders. It is therefore important to provide clear guidelines to applicants and reviewers as to what we like to pursue.\n\nWhile VDP 26.1 [3] and its references [4, 8] already contain some indications, after almost two years of operations and an overwhelming number of applications received, it becomes necessary to provide more stringent guidelines.\n\nA set of draft evaluation criteria are available in “Major drug project evaluation” [5], but these are mainly designed to thoroughly evaluate proposals that are already in the funnel, as clarified in \"Implementation discussion for drug project evaluation\" [6], rather than to quickly filter proposals before they enter the funnel, which is the scope of this document.\n\nPreparing this document was one of the improvement actions decided at the VitaDAO offsite workshop that took place in May 2023 in Zuzalu.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe mission of VitaDAO is to fund longevity science that can improve people’s life [2] in a self-sustainable manner. Therefore all funded projects should accelerate R&D aimed at ultimately delivering concrete solutions to increase healthy lifespan [1], while providing economic returns that can be used to fund more projects and support the organization without needing to permanently raise funds from external sources, in an attempt to maximize long-term impact with limited resources.\n\nThe criteria proposed in the next section are designed to perform a quick screen of proposals by assessing the alignment with this mission.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe proposed pass/fail criteria are split into the following categories, covered in the next sub-sections:\n\n* Longevity fit\n* Team expertise\n* Scientific viability\n* Commercial potential\n* Budget feasibility\n* Application completeness\n\nBecause these criteria contain some degree of subjectivity, they should be taken as guidelines.\n\nSome of these criteria are inspired to “Major drug project evaluation DRAFT 2. 2 March 2023” [5].\n\nSome of these criteria are inspired to the evaluation grid of Capital Cell [7], a biotech crowd-equity.\n\nThese criteria have already been through a round of internal review with the participants of VitaDAO offsite workshop of May 2023, but further comments to these criteria are welcome and will be used to reach consensus on a final version to be voted on chain as an update of VDP 26.1 section 2.\n\n## Longevity fit\n\nThe proposal should have the potential to:\n\n* modulate one or more mechanisms of aging [8, 10]\n  * including those in [9] and other ones with reasonable scientific consensus\n* treat or prevent multiple age-related diseases [8]\n* extend healthspan or lifespan of healthy individuals\n  * this should be documented with in-vivo data in humans or model-organisms produced by the applicant’s research or other data from peer-reviewed literature.\n\nAny intervention that does not fulfill all three criteria is not an ideal fit for VitaDAO. However, we realize that there are different opinions as to what truly qualifies as longevity, including among our reviewers.\n\nWe recognize meeting each of the three criteria is highly subjective. Nevertheless, please do your best to explain how your therapy might fit each of them.\n\n## Team Expertise\n\nThe team should include at least one person with a background relevant for the proposal.\n\nIdeally the team should include more than one person, except in cases of exceptional background of the solo founder.\n\n## Scientific viability\n\nAt the time of the application, the proposed intervention shall at least be at TRL3 (technology readiness level): experimental and/or analytical proof of concept. This includes in-vitro results and/or strong bioinformatics or machine learning evidence.\n\nThe results should be encouraging.\n\n## Commercial potential\n\nThe proposal should include one or more reasonable routes to market [4]. To fulfill this requirement it is sufficient to:\n\n* identify one or more candidate indications with a market potential for which the intervention could be useful\n\n* provide a rough state of the art and competitive landscape, providing arguments in support of the novelty and competitiveness of the proposed intervention\n\nIt is OK if indication selection has not been finalized: in fact, the proposed use of the proceeds could include experiments to advance in the indication selection process.\n\n## Budget feasibility\n\nThe budget required should:\n\n* not exceed 200 k$\n  * this is based on VitaDAO’s current runway, and may evolve\n* be sufficient to reach an inflexion point that enables to raise further funding or exit\n  * if the requested budget is part of a larger round, the applicant should give us confidence that it can be closed\n\nThis requirement typically implies the need to produce defensible intellectual property (IP) at the end of the project.\n\nProposals that can reach an inflexion point with a budget of less than 100k will be preferred.\n\n## Application completeness\n\nThe application submission form on VitaDAO internet site [10] should be filled in most of its parts with sufficient information.\n\nImportantly, the application should contain information on the use of the proceeds.\n\nIt should also include a short video pitch with the founder(s).\n\nIf this proposal is approved, the application submission form [10] and the accompanying instructions and Q&A webpage will be updated accordingly, potentially including tutorials and references.\n\n## References\n\n1.

      "content": "## VDP-110: Allocating Resources for the Next Batch of VitaDAO Longevity Fellows\n\nProject Lead: [Maria Marinova](mailto:maria@vitadao.com)\n\nTeam: Vincent Weisser, [Alex Dobrin](mailto:alex@vitadao.com)\n\n## Summary\n\nWe propose for VitaDAO to allocate $10,000 USD to fund the next batch of VitaDAO Longevity Fellows with need-based micro-grants of up to $2,000 USD. These grants will support and encourage scientists, students, and longevity enthusiasts to enrich their knowledge or further develop an interest in longevity science, while growing the VitaDAO ecosystem and attracting talent.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe VitaDAO Longevity Fellowship was established to financially empower and encourage individuals interested in becoming more deeply involved in longevity science research. The first fellowships were enabled by our generous donors from our Gitcoin project “Longevity Fellowship Grants”. Due to the positive feedback from the broader community and fellows, as well as amazing unfunded applicants, we want to fund a new batch. This will go a long way in advancing longevity research and our broader community.\n\n## Funding\n\nWe plan to top up the budget with funds from other longevity organizations and donations sent to fellowship.vitadao.eth. This will help us to provide need-based funding to our fellows to pursue research, attend conferences, or join programs such as the Longevity Biotech Fellowship.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe propose to fund VitaDAO Longevity Fellows with micro-grants of up to $2k. This will help them to get more deeply involved in longevity research, take a break to focus on getting deeper into longevity, attend a conference, or join a program such as On Deck Longevity Fellowship.\n\nWe have developed a strategy to keep the Fellows engaged and connected after each funding round, including social channels, quarterly meet-ups, fellow highlights and VITA bounties to incentivize them to contribute to the work of Dealflow and Awareness working groups.\n\n## Assessment Process\n\nWe suggest having a rigorous assessment process at the end of the program. An idea would be to require fellows to deliver small reports covering the work done, usage of proceeds (which can be compared against initial intentions), and next steps (if any). By doing this, we can generate KPIs that can be compared with previous/future batches, reflect on expenses and keep track of potential future engagement with fellows.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe believe that this proposal will help us to continue our mission of advancing longevity research and building a strong community around it. We look forward to your support and feedback.",

The basis for the current figures in VDP-72 were based on work done between July 1, 2022 and December 2022.\n\nAdditionally, as part of the review, there is a desire to have a more holistic view of compensation for VitaDAO within the context of the wider web3 eco-system and startup biotech organizations.\n\nThis proposal initiates the annual review of compensation and governance allocations as contemplated in VDP-72, and seeks to appoint a review squad made up of resources with verifiable experience in compensation design.\n\n# Specification\n\n1. This proposal serves as notice to the community that VitaDAO is seeking expressions of interest for participation in the compensation review squad. </p>\n2. The squad shall consist of a minimum of 5 and no more than 9 members.\n3. Squad members shall self-organize and may request support from the Coordination Working Group including access to historical data, and other information deemed relevant.\n4. Squad members shall receive a bounty which shall be established as part of the VDP enacted as a result of this review.\n5.  *Governance allocations under the L-TIP program of VDP-72, Appendix E shall be paused effective July 1, 2023 until the completion of this review and any subsequent changes are implemented. Governance allocations will be allocated retroactively based on the results of this review. Amounts vesting under VDP-67 and VDP-97 are unaffected.*\n\n# Implementation\n\n1. Interested parties shall send an e-mail to compensation@vitadao.com by July 14th, 2023 indicating their interest in participating, and providing a brief bio identifying their experience in developing and administering compensation policy and design. References may be requested to verify this experience.\n2. The pre-qualified candidates for the squad shall be presented to the community on July 18th on Discourse, and move to a ratification vote on Snapshot.on July 22nd\n3. The target start date for the squad is on July 29, 2023.\n4. The squad will be required to report to the community on or before August 22, 2023.\n5. A community call or other engagement with the community to discuss the report is anticipated on or before August 25th. \n6. Any proposed changes to VDP-72 will be put forth in a proposal to be published on Discourse on or before August 29th, for ratification by tokenholders by on-chain vote via Snapshot. \n\n# Timeline\n\n* Expression of Interest to Participate in Compensation Squad July 14, 2023\n* Announcement of Pre Qualified Candidates on Discourse July 18, 2023\n* Ratification Vote on Snapshot for Squad July 22, 2023\n* Squad commences work July 29, 2023\n* Report from Squad due August 22, 2023\n* Community engagement/call August 25, 2023\n* VDP Proposal to implement changes August 29, 2023",

      "title": "VDP-93 Proposal to Revise Governance Workflow",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nVitaDAO has reached a point in its growth where the size of the organisation and the volume of governance activity has made it impractical for all but the mostly full-time contributors to keep up with the volume of governance as well as the nuances of the proposals.\n\nTo overcome this, and align the community for what is expected to be considerable growth for the remainder of the year, this proposal seeks to strengthen the governance development and review process leading up to community voting to ensure relevant concerns are documented and addressed.\n\nThis proposal has changes, or otherwise impacts [VDP-1](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40/16), [VDP-59](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-59-vitadao-governance-amendment-3/898/4), and [VDP-60](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-60-seasonal-governance/907).\n\n# Team\n\nTodd White, Gavin Singh\n\n# Motivation\n\nAs VitaDAO has grown, the complexity of managing governance activities has increased substantively. Most governance proposals are worded through the eyes of the authors to achieve specific intent and, up to this point in time, VitaDAO’s active contributors have been able to balance all the differing perspectives through informal conversations.\n\nMeanwhile, ecosystem risks have increased both in the wider macro-economic and regulatory environment which require that proposals be considered through differing, and often specialised, lenses.\n\nWhile the current process of allowing all members of the community to propose governance must be maintained, the process to reach a Phase 3 (Snapshot) vote must involve some checks and balances to ensure that awareness of potential risks are communicated to the community, and that decisions by the community are made with the full scope of issues in mind.\n\nFirstly, we propose to standardise the VDP designations of specific proposals into series such that subsequent changes to a proposal be (re-)designated as an amendment of the original.\n\nSecondly, we propose to improve and increase the due diligence of Phase 2 governance to include a higher level of transparency and risk assessment to be applied to all proposals through the application of a gated workflow to ensure risk assessments are available to token holders prior to Snapshot voting.\n\nThirdly, we propose to clarify the gating of Phase 2 proposals to Phase 3 based on resolution of issues brought up during Phase 2.\n\n# Specification\n\nStandardised VDP Nomenclature and Versioning\n\nWhile active proposals follow the VDP-XX nomenclature, we propose to supplement the DAO Constitution Category with specific categories of versioned proposals to simplify the ability of the community to find the latest and most current governance on a specific topic. Namely:\n\n*000 Series - VitaDAO Multi-sig and Tokenomics*\n\n*100 Series - Governance Framework and Processes*\n\n*200 Series - Operational Policies*\n\n*300 Series - Funding Portfolio*\n\n*400 Series - Non-Profit Initiatives*\n\n*500 Series - Budgeting and Finance Reporting.*\n\nAs each active VDP proposal is passed, the proposal will be added to the appropriate Category above, and if the VDP is a material change to a previous VDP, the previous VDP will be annotated as “DEPRECATED - VDP-xx : Valid Until [DATE]]”. If the changes to a previous VDP are considered minor or housekeeping in nature, the previous VDP may be amended in-line with References to the VDP that was passed requesting its modification.\n\n**Revised Phase 2 Proposal Workflow**\n\n**1. Proposal Formation**\n\n  1. We propose that as part of the Phase 1 (Ideation) phase, the proponent(s) of a new proposal should submit their draft proposal via the governance channel on Discord for intake.\n\n**2. Clarity Review**\n\n  1. The Governance Squad will then invite the proponent(s) to give a brief presentation on the proposal to ensure the Governance Squad understands the intent of the proposal and informal feedback / coaching on the proposal content may be provided.\n  2. This is not an opportunity to gate the proposal, except for situations where a proposal is a clear violation of the VitaDAO Code of Conduct. The Governance Squad is intended to provide support to the proponent(s) to ensure their proposal is properly structured and their intent is clear - independent of the opinions of the Governance Squad members on the substance of the proposal.\n\n**3. Feedback and Resolution of Comments**\n\n  1. Once the Governance Squad presentation is done and members provide their initial feedback, and the proponent(s) have made any changes as a result of that feedback, the proponent(s) can add the proposal to Discourse for initial community review.\n  2. During this process the proposal may require additional changes to reflect community feedback and may iterate several times.\n  3. When a proposal receives comments, the proponent(s) is expected to respond to the comments by either making the suggested changes, providing further information, or stating the reason for not wishing to accept the suggestions.\n  4. When a comment or suggestion has been resolved, the commenter should indicate resolution using the checkbox in the response from the proponent. If the commenter has already voted on the Phase 2 poll, and their concerns overall have been resolved, they are encouraged to re-vote to reflect the resolution of their comment(s).\n  5. For clarity, if a proposal does not have a majority between Agree + Agree with Revisions (that have been resolved), the proposal may not proceed to the next stage.\n\n**4. Validation Stage**\n\nEach proposal will then be circulated as follows:\n\n1. Budget Review: If the proposal requests funding, the Coordination Working Group must confirm that a budget exists for the project taking into account other commitments and provide any guidance or impact on the operations of the squad/working group budget whose budget is being impacted.\n\n*Gate: Analysis to be provided and a budget statement appended to Phase 2 draft.*\n\n2. Resource Review: Where a proposal requires people to execute specific tasks, the proponent(s) must either provide all the resources to execute, or where resources from elsewhere within the DAO are requested, those resources need to confirm their availability and any impact on other DAO initiatives.\n\n*Gate: Availability and Impact Sign-off from other resources, appended to Phase 2 draft.*\n\n3. Legal Review: All proposals shall be reviewed by a member of the legal squad to confirm the wording of proposals are consistent with the regulatory and legal environments the proposal may be impacted by.\n\nDue to a high degree of cross pollination within the ecosystem legal review shall be provided only by members of the legal squad where it is confirmed that they have no pecuniary interest in the subject matter of the proposal and are operating at arms-length to the subject matter.\n\nIn cases where this cannot be achieved within the active members of the legal squad, this proposal authorises the Coordination Steward to engage with arms-length outside legal counsel to perform the review as needed.\n\n*Gate: Legal to provide a concurrence statement that indicates agreement with the proposal as worded, or if changes are required, the proponent must make the necessary changes to achieve legal compliance. The concurrence statement from the Legal Squad / external counsel shall be appended only upon approval with the proposal.*\n\n**5) Transition to Phase 3 Stage (Snapshot)**\n\n The proposal shall be published to Snapshot and shall include the final approved text from Discourse, as well as the Budget Statement and Legal Statement. The Governance Squad may only use the existing summary from the Discourse proposal and any change which may need to occur for presentation purposes on Snapshot shall be pre-approved by legal. All links to external documents shall point to copies on IPFS.\n\n# Implementation\n\nIf this proposal passes, the above processes will occur with immediate effect.

For some of those VitaDAO has already invested significant incubation and due diligence effort. Others are still early in the deal flow, but could turn out to be good opportunities. VHF is positioned to help bring those projects to life.\n\n\n# Specification\nVHF and VitaDAO’s interests are aligned in bringing these projects to life. Since VHF does not have the funds, but has the capacity to do so, VitaDAO can loan VHF the funds and secure the  loan against the underlying equity assets.\nVitaDAO, through a secured loan agreement for $400,000, could help VHF fund up to 8 projects within the $50-100K range.\nThis proposal is consistent with the Discourse proposal “VDP-96 [Governance] Increase of allocation for equity investments”, where the majority of voters supported a 400k increase over the other options: https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-96-governance-increase-of-allocation-for-equity-investments/1264\n\n\n# Vote\nWe ask you, token holders, to choose one among the four options of the above Discourse proposal:\n1. I agree to provide a $400k secured loan to VHF so they may fund equity-type projects.\n2. I agree to provide a $300k secured loan to VHF so they may fund equity-type projects.\n3. I agree to provide a $200k secured loan to VHF so they may fund equity-type projects.\n4. I do not agree to provide a secured loan to VHF so they may fund equity-type projects.\n\n\nYour votes will be taken into account in the following manner:\n1. If the sum of the votes for options 1, 2 and 3 is strictly more than 50%, an additional allocation will be computed based on the vote-weighted average among these three options\n2.

      "title": "VDP 107 [Governance] - Dealflow Steward Restructuring & Network Steward Preparation",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nVitaDAOs involvement with the Zuzalu pop-up mini-city experiment has opened up an opportunity to further develop our network of supporters and contributors, and upon evaluating the success of Zuzalu, we propose that a dedicated effort be undertaken.\n\nMoreover, to further empower and organize its dedicated community of contributors, the Longevity Dealflow Working Group is welcoming new structured efforts that will build upon the existing foundation and bring fresh perspectives.\n\nThis proposal seeks to adjust the current Steward structure to permit for a dedicated resource to further these opportunities.\n\nIt is proposed that:\n\n1. VitaDAO creates a new Steward position focused on evaluating the development of longevity jurisdictions, fundraising and strategic contributor relations (“Network Steward”).\n2. Laurence Ion is stepping down as Dealflow Steward upon passing of this proposal. As a member of VitaCore, Laurence Ion will propose the scope and function of the new Network Steward role in a separate VDP(later).\n3. Eleanor Davies assumes the role of Interim Dealflow Steward until regularly scheduled elections pursuant to VDP-19 Onboarding Option A.\n4. Tyler Golato, as a Founding Longevity & Dealflow Steward, will be joining the Steward weekly calls to share his insights and provide guidance to the Interim Dealflow Steward, enhancing the team's collaborative efforts until the next scheduled election.\n\nThis proposal amends [VDP-69](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-69-proposal-to-realign-working-group-structures/960/4),\n\n# Team\n\n@alexdobrin, @longevion, @PaulHaas, @Taliskermalt, @tylergolato\n\n# Motivation\n\n1. The success of Zuzalu in elevating VitaDAO’s visibility has shown the importance of in-person gatherings, network building, participation in the development of longevity jurisdictions, Strategic Member relations, and business development.\n\n2. This type of endeavor requires a committed contributor who has established themselves in the longevity community and who has the personal flexibility to execute in this new and challenging role.\n\n3. In recognition of his personal interests, and based on Laurence’s successful efforts at Zuzalu, it is proposed that Laurence Ion assumes this new role and continues what has already become an integral part of his contribution to VitaDAO.\n\n4. At the same time, the Longevity Dealflow group has matured with the addition of new company building and commercialization talent and now has a nexus of talent which requires less promotion and more operational execution.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe role of the Interim Steward is defined below. The role of the Network Steward is outlined additionally, and will require a separate proposal and refinement.\n\n### The Interim Dealflow Steward\n\nDealflow is a highly operational process, requiring someone increasingly process driven and with biotech VC experience. Eleanor Davies’ background at OnDeck, LabDAO, and now VitaDAO over the past several months gives her the background needed to execute in this role\n\nResponsibilities include:\n\n1. Outbound Deal Sourcing Strategy and Execution\n\nThe Interim Dealflow Steward develops and executes a targeted deal sourcing strategy. The objective is to source 50-100 new outbound deals per month that align with the company's VD funding mandate. This individual focuses on identifying high-quality researchers and projects, leveraging their profound understanding of DeSci, funding mechanisms, and the broader ecosystem.\n\n2. Communication and Stakeholder Engagement\n\nThe steward also actively communicates the company's DeSci value proposition to potential portfolio companies, universities, industry experts, and ecosystem stakeholders. They are tasked with fostering relationships that can lead to fruitful partnerships and collaborations.\n\n3. Deal Screening and Contributor Motivation\n\nThe steward designs initial screening metrics for high-quality deals and motivates contributors to source deals that meet these criteria. This process ensures a constant influx of quality leads into the company's deal pipeline.\n\n4. Inbound Application Process Management\n\nThe steward oversees the inbound application process, ensuring an efficient operational backend from application or referral to the funnel. They are responsible for ensuring that every application aligns with the company's defined funding mandate.\n\n5. Due Diligence and Evaluation\n\nThe Interim Dealflow Steward conducts comprehensive due diligence checks, assessing aspects such as longevity fit, IP diligence, regulatory compliance, and team expertise. They also have a solid foundation in drug project evaluation criteria, which aids in the accurate assessment and valuation of potential deals.\n\n6. Research Management and Project Incubation\n\nIn research management, the steward cultivates relationships with universities and Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs). During the project incubation phase, they work with the Builder Squad to establish a supportive network of mentors, advisors, and subject matter experts to back the projects.\n\n7. Portfolio Management and Tracking\n\nThe steward oversees portfolio management and monitors the progress of portfolio companies, identifying areas for improvement and implementing corrective measures when necessary. They also track KPIs and milestones, contributing to follow-on investments, partnerships, and exit strategies.\n\n8. Operations and Talent Management\n\nFinally, the Interim Dealflow Steward manages underlying operations, which includes aggressively tracking working group-wide KPIs, maintaining quarterly reviews with DAO Stewards, and implementing a metrics dashboard. They onboard top talent into the DAO, providing clear pathways for contributions and maintaining a well-functioning deal flow pipeline and voting process.\n\n### The Network Steward Role (Later VDP)\n\nThe time is right to define a role that more accurately describes what Laurence has been focusing on in recent months: fundraising, recruiting, building relationships, advocacy (speeches, interviews, etc), community building & in-person gatherings.\n\nResponsibilities could include:\n\n1. Maintain engagement with new and current strategic members and contributors\n\n1. Represent VitaDAO at Network State, city building and Special Economic Zone events, interviews and conferences\n\n2. Seed in-person gatherings and pop-up cities like Zuzalu\n3. Negotiate with governments for progressive and permissive jurisdictions to create longevity cities / zones and inspire existing states to become the “Silicon Valley” of Longevity\n4. General business development\n5. Quarterly updates and representation to the token holder community\n\n# Implementation\n\n1. Hand-off of dealflow responsibilities from Laurence Ion to Eleanor Davies as soon as this proposal passes.\n2. Laurence Ion to post a Network Steward VDP for community - outlining vision, goals, and milestones for the role/projects.\n3. Tyler Golato to be invited to weekly Steward meetings as mentor.\n\n# Timeline\n\n1. Changes with immediate effect upon proposal approval.",

      "title": "VDP-89 [Assessment]: ExcepGen Inc - RNA therapeutics for longevity",
      "content": "*One-liner*: Optimizing RNA Delivery for Longevity Therapeutics\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG team\n* **Scientific & business evaluation**: two longevity scientists, one biotech VC, two biotech entrepreneurs, \n* **Shepherd**: Michael Baran\n* **Other squad members**: Paolo Binetti\n* **Sourced by**: Michael Baran\n## Project Lead\n* **Name**: Thomas Folliard\n* **Email address**: [Thomas.folliard@excepgen.com](mailto:Thomas.folliard@excepgen.com)\n\n\n## Simple Summary\n\n[ExcepGen](https://www.excepgen.com/) is developing a new generation of vaccines and therapeutics with its RNAx platform. ExcepGen’s RNAx is delivered alongside primary RNA cargo. RNAx is translated by the cell to produce a regulator protein that modulates signals between the nucleus and the cytoplasm of cells in a tunable manner. By doing this, we keep cells in a low-stress state improving the effectiveness of the RNA cargo to produce significantly more protein leading to increased protection.\n\nWe are applying this technology to produce RNA vaccines for challenging antigens, such as universal flu antigens.\n\n## Problem\n\nWhile industry-standard messenger (mRNA) was successful in producing a COVID-19 vaccine, this was partly possible because the Spike antigen is highly immunogenic. Other RNA vaccines that target more challenging viral antigens may require longer antigen expression and better immune engagement to be effective.\n\nSelf-amplifying RNA (saRNA) is a promising modality for eliciting broader immunogenicity and making better RNA-based vaccines, but it comes with a catch-22. On one hand: saRNA allows for greatly increased antigen expression, potentially requiring lower doses, increasing valences (number of encoded antigens), and providing better adaptive immune responses. On the other hand: its delivery and replication cause inflammatory intermediates and harmful innate signaling that counteract the potential benefits.\n\n## Solution\n\nWith ExcepGen technology, saRNA translation is protected from these cellular triggers.\n\nWe encode RNA to produce a regulator protein that makes cells amenable to RNA instructions, resulting in majorly increased cargo expression and prevention of unwanted innate signaling and inflammatory responses. The regulator works by dampening transport of signals between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Others think this sounds like it would be detrimental to RNA translation and cell function. Counterintuitively, by dampening that “information highway” for the cell, we actually prevent stress signaling and innate immune signaling. The expected MOA is that stress signals are activated when certain cell signaling pathways rise above “normal” signal thresholds. By slowing down the flow of information, ExcepGen technology makes cells amenable to executing the instructions they have been given. We believe that this technology will open up a whole new world of RNA drugs across vaccines and oncology.\n\nWe have demonstrated that\n\n1. saRNAx produces a 400% boost in cargo expression in vivo in mice compared to standard saRNA\n\n2. saRNAx produces up to 2600% improvement in cargo expression in innate-immune-competent human BJ cells\n\n3. saRNAx majorly reduces, and in some cases completely prevents, deleterious inflammatory cytokine release\n\n\n## Opportunity\n\nBased on these exciting platform data, we are pursuing the holy grail of vaccines - a fully differentiated universal pan-flu vaccine that we believe can only be unlocked by saRNAx technology. This product is our primary focus for the vaccine space with additional pipeline products planned for vaccines, protein replacement, and gene-editing.\n\nThe competitive advantages over other research are:\n\n* *Core technology mechanism:* We identified a counterintuitive, holistic way to make RNA perform better. Because our mechanism is counterintuitive, others in the space have not already been exploiting it.\n\n* *Synergistic technology:* Our technology works across many RNA types so we can work with our own RNA modalities or those generated by Pharma partners (including linear and self-amplifying, modified and unmodified, etc.)\n\n* *IP Strategy:* We have applied our technology broadly across RNA types and other nucleic acids to demonstrate our key benefits. We kept the company in stealth mode while developing our strong IP portfolio, which now gives us a strong foundation for technology partnerships in the RNA space.\n\n* *Nimbleness:* We are a small team and we can iterate quickly. Our research process enables rapid *in vitro* and *in vivo* testing and refinement.\n\nWe know people need specifically what we are making because of the number of major mRNA companies looking to evaluate our technology for licensing.\n\n\n## IP Potential\nWe have already generated significant IP and we expect that we have strong IP coverage. We have a portfolio of patent applications submitted by Cooley LLP to protect our core technology and its applications.\n\n\n## Relevance for Longevity\nNext-generation vaccines with better efficacy and broader protection are critical for increasing longevity. Severe viral infections have been associated immune dysfunction and chronic inflammation that match signatures of premature aging, an effect that can persist even after the pathogen has been cleared. Moreover, seasonal infections are a common cause of life shortening, frequently even in otherwise healthy individuals. The [NIH’s National Institute on Aging](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/flu-and-older-adults) has categorized flu as a very serious and life-threatening disease for elderly adults. The respiratory illness caused by viral influenza infection caused more than 12,000 deaths in older Americans over age 65 in [2018](https://www.aarp.org/health/conditions-treatments/info-2018/older-flu-deaths-rising.html). Now in the endemic phase of Covid-19, the risk that aging populations face from viral infections has never been greater.\n\n\n## Team\nThe company founding team has deep technical expertise engineering reliability into biology for use in unreliable environments such as in microgravity and the rhizosphere. Educated at top universities, the co-founding team met at Oxford university and founded ExcepGen to engineer reliability into genetic medicines.\n* Thomas Folliard (Chief Executive Officer)\n* Barbara Mertins (Chief Technology Officer)\n* Katherine Barcay (Chief Operating Officer)\n* Imre Mager (Head of R&D)\n* Jason Wojcechowskyj (Director of Vaccines)\n* Pragya Mukherjee (Scientist)\n\n\n## Funding\n\nExcepGen is raising an equity round and has 100,000 USD allocated for the VitaDAO community\n\nThey currently apply the technology to vaccines. The proceeds would fund in vitro research, scientific operations, and an in vivo immunogenicity study.\n\n\n## Senior Review Digest\n\n**Qualitative assessment**\n\nAll 5 reviewers recommend to advance this project for community feedback and provide the following evaluation summaries:\n\n* “I really like this tech, lots of data and I saw other cancer data. The responses to my questions were acceptable–I would love a comparison to other tech but that’s not a big deal right now. Unlike many of our other assets, this is “advanced”, has lots of data, other partners, money raised, and could have a near term inflection point.”\n\n* “I recommend funding this project by the VitaDAO community due to the huge potential of the platform for numerous applications across a variety of important therapeutic conditions or for prophylactic use. An equity investment is preferred to benefit from the potential of the platform rather than a specific project. The proposed flu vaccine project may address some questions related to immunogenicity and functionality of the platform for a pan-vaccine approach, but has at this stage limited relevance for VitaDAO and its mission.”\n\n* “Technology with great potential in the use of Flu vaccine. The connection between the Flu vaccine and VitaDAO’s mission is strong considering the great impact flu has on especially the elderly population. The partnering potential of this technology is very big and I believe this could exit before clinical PoC has been achieved. The only downside is that we have not seen the true background of the 'special sauce', which was not shared with the VitaDAO reviewers. Nevertheless, I hope this program receives support from the VitaDAO community.”\n\n* “Interesting technology that could be applied to mRNA vaccines with a large number of potential partners. With Pfizer on board as an investor, they may have a very clear and direct path toward a lucrative first partnership.”\n\n* “Strong team, with strong investors and partners. Technology seems to work to increase protein expression many fold and to last much longer than mRNA could otherwise. Some concern about one trick pony, lack of MOAT.”\n\n**Quantitative Assessment**\n\nThe reviewers have scored the proposal on different aspects including general conviction, on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being the highest). Here are the average scores:\n* Novelty & Impact: 4.2\n* Feasibility & Data: 3.6\n* Relevance: 3.4\n* Science Team: 4.6\n* Market Advantage: 4.2\n* IP Potential: 4.8\n* Conviction score: 4.2",

      "title": "VDP-102 [Governance] Portfolio Management Process",
      "content": "## One liner\n*An ongoing process to manage the growing portfolio of the VitaDAO projects in an effective and efficient way, helping to execute them and to support all decision-making required.*\n\n## Motivation\nSince its foundation, VitaDAO has organized itself to source and assess opportunities to fund longevity biotech ventures with deal-flow processes spanning from the entry of an opportunity into our funnel to on-chain vote on our platform and decision to fund.\nThanks to these processes, VitaDAO has funded (directly or with partner organizations like Vitality Healthspan Foundation, VHF) about 20 projects, including startups, spinoffs, and academic projects developing some of the most promising interventions in longevity.\nAs the number of projects in VitaDAO’s portfolio increases, so does the importance to track and control their execution and provide value to founders thanks to VitaDAO’s wealth of expertise, with a structured portfolio management process.\n\n## Details\nThis proposal aims at initializing this process with a few best practices and practical tools.\n\nThe following tools are proposed:\n* Project Portfolio Register (PPR)\n* Quarterly Project Reviews (QPR)\n* Milestone Tracking File (MTF)\n* Budget Contingency File (BCF)\n* Project Portfolio Dashboard (PPD)\n* Project Portfolio Mapping (PPM)\n* Projects Summaries (PS)\n* Portfolio Repository (PR)\n\nThe following staffing profile is proposed:\n* Project Portfolio Administrator (PPA)\n* Steering Committee\n\nThese items are detailed in the next sections, as well as:\n* Tools implementation\n* Budget\n* Success metrics\n\nImportantly, because this process is new, it has not been explicitly taken into account in already agreed term sheets. Thus, the level of implementation of the process will be discussed with each project taking into account agreed information rights. This dialogue will build experience to include in future terms investor information rights covering the portfolio management process in a way that is mutually beneficial for both VitaDAO and the funded entities.\n\n## Project Portfolio Register\nThis is a list of the funded projects, with all their relevant features, useful to have a view of the full portfolio at a glance. Each line in this file shall include the following objective information:\n* VDP number\n* Name of the project\n* PI/CEO\n* Type\n* Entity\n* Country\n* Funding Amount\n* Payment: whether it has been made, or if is committed\n* Deal: whether the terms are IP-NFT or equity\n* Application: therapeutics, diagnostics, digital health\n* Indication: go to market indication\n* Hallmark of aging: DNA repair, metabolism, …\n* Mechanism of Action (MOA): how it works in one line\n* Product: small molecule, mab, cell therapy, supplements, app, …\n* Stage: preclinical in vitro, preclinical in vivo, clinical phase 1, …\n* Start date\n* End date\n\nSubjective information can also be useful:\n* Opportunity class: high, medium, low\n* Risk class: high, medium, low\n* Lifespan extension potential: high, medium low\n* Healthspan extension potential: high, medium low\n\nThese subjective assessments could be asked and extracted from senior reviews.\n\nEach shepherd is responsible to fill in this file once her/his project is funded.\n\n[This file is already available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13-f2wnsj0VG63PFqnqZwCG3QhjzG3eKI/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109656541918840977283&rtpof=true&sd=true).\n\n## Quarterly Project Reviews\nThis review takes place at the end of each quarter.\n\nA representative from each funded project is invited to join and present their progress according to an agreed agenda, where each project is assigned 15-30 minutes.\n\nEach funded project shall provide a minimum of two slides, according to a VitaDAO template:\n* 1 summary slide including\n  * Budget allocated, budget spent\n  * Achieved milestones, and upcoming milestones forecasts\n  * Any outstanding issues to be discussed\n* 1 results slide with\n  * Recap of achieved results\n  * Achieved results since the last QPR\n\nThe format includes a 10-20 minute presentation followed by discussion.\n\nA steering committee composed by VitaCORE members (see below) is invited and empowered to make decisions during the meeting, within limits, in particular in terms of budget (see below).\n\nA panel of senior experts is also invited to join the review and provide recommendations. This could be VitaDAO senior reviewers  and people from a future VitaDAO advisory board.\n\nThe number of people should be sufficient to have relevant feedback and decisions but not too high as to hamper the process and burden. A ballpark figure is 5 to 10 people.\n\nKey decisions, including scope changes, and recommendations are tracked in minutes of meeting. Actions are registered in the MTF, described below. Budget changes are tracked in the BCF, described below.\n\nFor scheduling simplicity, the QPR could be divided into 90 min sessions based on the type of projects, for example: \n* Startups session\n* Academic projects session \n* Spinouts session + anything else\nAn alternative approach could be based on the scope of projects, for example:\n* Small molecules\n* Cell and gene therapy\n* Diagnostics\n\nA different cadence, for example 6 months, or different level of information could be considered based on projects’ specific constraints. Indeed, while the objective is full coverage of the progress of the VitaDAO portfolio across all its funded projects, it is important to take into account their specificities, including differences between startups, spinoffs, and academic projects, such as:\n* mature startup, requiring less guidance\n* stealth startups, having stronger confidentiality constraints\n* some projects not seeing the value of this process and not having any contractual requirement to follow it\n\nThis process is coordinated by the PPA.\n\n## Milestone Tracking File\nThis file includes all the milestones of all projects in one place.\n\nEach project typically includes at least three milestones, kickoff, mid-term progress, and closure.\n\nEach milestone shall be identified with:\n* Project name\n* Milestone name\n* Milestone criticality (from minor to go / no go)\n* Due date\n* Forecast date\n* Actual completion date\n* Status: whether work towards the milestone is not yet started, or is ongoing, or completed, or canceled.\n* Status: including any blocking point and outstanding action to unblock\n\nThis file can be used as an input to produce portfolio planning KPIs, such as number of milestones completed vs forecast or average delay.\n\nThis process is taken care of by the PPA.\n\n## Budget Contingency File\nThe budget needs of each project might evolve as it is executed. One project might run into issues, which require extra funding in order to reach the targeted inflection point to raise the next tranche. Another might fail a critical go / no go milestone, and therefore be canceled, therefore freeing funding that can be used for other projects.\n\nTherefore it is useful to foresee a portfolio contingency pool of order of 5-10% of the total reference budget of all projects in the portfolio.\n\nEach quarter, as projects report their status, or occasionally when major budget events, as in the above examples, require attention, the funding available in the portfolio contingency pool needs to be updated. This can be done with a file where each line includes:\n* Project name\n* Reference budget\n* Delta budget\n* New budget\n* Reason for delta\n* Approved by who\n\nLarge project budget delta, for example above 25% of the reference budget would need to be governed. Medium deltas, for example between 10% and 25% would need approval by VitaCORE, which meet weekly. Small deltas, for example below 10% could be decided with lower-level mechanisms.\n\nThis process is taken care of by the PPA.\n\n## Project Portfolio Dashboard\nThis dashboard should be available to the broader community to engage with. Ideally, anyone within the DAO should be able to a) see what's going on; b) find projects they think they can contribute to; and c) reach out to whoever(s) is leading that project.\nHere are two examples:\n* Each project is associated with green/yellow/red status color flags along the classic project management dimensions of budget, planning, results. Each of the color flags should be motivated with a one-liner, based on the outcome of the latest QPR.\n* See https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQEj_rfukzIsmQ/article-cover_image-shrink_423_752/0/1648203957593?e=1692230400&v=beta&t=ebrIZyOFfPyr187foV2VWH4-cSmmD04i1YHMg-Fm6kQ\n\n## Project Portfolio Mapping\nThis includes graphics that synthetically represent the portfolio composition based on key variables. For example:\n* Risk/opportunity mapping: is the portfolio balanced or skewed?\n* Longevity/healthspan potential mapping: is the portfolio balanced or skewed?\n* Hallmarks of aging coverage: do we have a balanced coverage or are some areas over/under represented\n* Companies vs. spinoffs\n* Geography\n\nThis mapping is based on information from the Project Portfolio Register.\n\nIt can be made available to token-holders to help inform their decisions on new projects, for example to rebalance the portfolio, or to focus on an area of interest.\n\n## Project Summaries\nEach funded project shall have a non-confidential project summary that can be shared publicly. This already exists for many VitaDAO’s project, as a project webpage, which should be generalized: https://www.vitadao.com/projects\n\nIn each of these webpages, the “Latest Project Updates” section gives information on project progress. The slides from the quarterly reviews for a given project can be tapped into to populate this section, or the slides themselves could be uploaded, pending confidentiality constraints.\n\nThese web pages could also be converted in a VitaDAO portfolio booklet, for example in PDF format, downloadable from our internet site.\n\nThis task is already partly covered by the Community and Awareness WG\n\n## Portfolio Repository\nA dedicated ““Project Portfolio Management” folder on VitaDAO’s G Drive in order to:\n* Store / manage the above proposed tools\n* Store deliverables and relevant ontology\nThis folder already exists (under a different name) here and it is partially populated with several project folders.\n\n## Project Portfolio Administrator\nThe Administrator is a very well organized person with a strong focus on execution and quality, accountable towards the Steering Committee, see next paragraph.\nInitially, Eleanor Davies is proposed for the Portfolio Administrator role, with the support of Paolo Binetti, both already with VitaDAO.\n* Eleanor has demonstrated project management skills in the VitaDAO Dealflow Working Group, and has experience operating high-performance start-ups, fund operations, and consulting for healthcare and biotech transactions\n* Paolo has about 20-year industry experience in project/program/portfolio management in research and development and is a certified project management professional (PMP)\n\nOther VitaDAO contributors are welcome to support specific tasks.\n\nAfter a 3 month period starting from the snapshot approval, these roles will be confirmed or not based on process deployment status.\n\n## Steering committee\nAnother important component is the Steering Committee who will make decisions based on projects’ progress, including but not limited during quarterly reviews. This is a small committee of people who know the projects well, have competences and experience, have sufficient time availability, and are empowered: this could be an uneven subset of VitaCORE members, for example 3 or 5.\n\nThe Steering Committee will seek advice from senior experts from the VitaDAO senior reviewers pool and from a future VitaDAO advisory board, on a need basis.\n\n## Tools implementation\nThese tools can be implemented using Google Workspace, or the equivalent free software. Concretely:\n* PPR, MTF, BCF, PPD can be done with Sheets (for data) and Slides (for data visualization)\n* QPR can be done with Mail and Calendar (for meetings organization), Slides (for the presentations), and Docs (for MoMs)\n* PS are web pages, or equivalently Docs or Slides\n\nThis requires a little work to prepare templates, but otherwise no software development or licence costs.\n\nSome tools could also be implemented with more modern software, such as Asana, which might be more efficient but require licences.\n\nPeople in the organization are familiar with different options, so we can quickly select the best options and deploy.\n\n## Budget\nPerforming portfolio management administration will require an initial and a recurring effort.\n\nThere are two main initial (non-recurring) cost items:\n* Setting up the tools\n* Training the people involved\nThese costs are estimated to be minor with respect to the recurring costs below.\n\nThere are three main recurring cost items:\n* Administration could have a yearly cost of about 1% of the budget of the running projects. For example, assuming 15 projects with an average budget of 200k for an average duration of two years, therefore a total budget of 3M, that would mean about 30k per year. This budget excludes the management activities for each specific project, which are the responsibility of their dedicated Project Managers, EIR or CEO, whose cost is already covered by their specific project budget.\n* The contribution of senior experts involved at quarterly reviews. Some of them would come from VitaCORE members, who already have a general compensation, but others would need to be specifically compensated, representing an additional cost item, estimated at another 1%.\n* Software licences, if any (see above).\n\nNote: assuming Eleanor Davies for the administrator role, this proposal does not require allocating an extra budget on top of the compensation that she already receives from VitaDAO.\n\n## Success metrics\nThese are of two types:\n* Effectiveness KPI, covering the classical OTOCOQ (on time, on cost, on quality) project management expectations in aggregated manner, such as achieving milestones on time, staying within budget, successful project completions.\n* Efficiency KPI, covering the portfolio management process itself, such as its actual cost, stakeholder satisfaction (ensuring that we do not uselessly burden project managers or entrepreneurs), etc.\n\nReturn on investment is another important portfolio KPI, although it does not only depend on project execution, but also on project choice and structuring.",

It will not however hold any IP or assets of VitaDAO beyond the fiat and cryptocurrencies provided to it by the VitaDAO community to execute its operational functions thereby limiting its legal exposure.\n\n# Specification\n\nA for-profit corporation, operating in Canada, with internal capacity to provide the following services:\n\n* Service provider contract management.\n* Finance and accounting services for VitaDAO and related projects (i.e. spin-off companies)\n* Management and execution of the Member Services program of VitaDAO.\n* Legal services.\n* Fiat banking for VitaDAO (including crypto-exchange services).\n* KYC/AML compliance for all functions within VitaDAO.\n\n# Implementation\n\nIf this proposal passes, the above company will be formed and any existing execution of operational functions will be transferred from VitaDAO’s network of agents to VitaDAO Global Services, Inc.\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n* Reduced Operational Risks.\n\n* Improved Coordination Execution.",

      "title": "VDP-100 (Fractionalization of Newcastle-Korolchuk IP-NFT)",
      "content": "*Fractionalizing VitaDAO’s first IP-NFT to enable community governance over the IP and involvement directly into the R&D decision-making and capital allocation processes.*\n\n# Background\nThis proposal aims to assess community interest in fractionalizing the “Discovering Novel Autophagy Activators’’ IP-NFT, funding the Viktor Korolchuk Lab at Newcastle University. Although the original fractionalization proposal [(VDP-73)](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-73-governance-fractionalization-of-apoptosens-ip-nft/1006) was to fractionalize the ApoptoSENS IP-NFT, given recent data readouts from several of the ongoing projects, we have the conviction that the Korolchuk IP-NFT has the greatest probability of resulting in longevity therapeutic of any of the projects in VitaDAO’s portfolio. As such, the Korolchuk Lab’s work is most deserving of further funding and governance directly by the community via fractionalization. Doing so will create direct greater capital and incentive for the VitaDAO community to contribute to the project and move it into overdrive.\n\n# Problem\nWe believe that validating fractionalization as a funding and incentive mechanism could shape the future of VitaDAO, and may provide necessary capital and attention of the community to optimally guide projects toward success. Fractionalization would allow individual members to personally hold ownership in the governance of the Newcastle-Korolchuk project, rather than indirectly through the VITA token. This proposal is specific to the Newcastle-Korolchuk IP-NFT, but hopes to lay the groundwork for how to effectuate fractionalization of all IP-NFTs in a way that is most accretive to individual members and the DAO, how to maximize research funded, how to preserve the DAO treasury, how to ensure compliance with relevant regulations, and how to provide VitaDAO members agency and incentive to contribute directly to the research. There has been justified skepticism within the VitaDAO on the utility of IP-NFTs over equity as the optimal funding vehicle for a DAO, and we hope that this proposal specifically and fractionalization generally will convince the community.\n\n# Proposed Solution\nTo address these challenges, we propose the fractionalization of the Newcastle IP-NFT with the following high-level protocol and rationale below:\n\n## Selecting Newcastle as the beachhead project\nWe feel that it is imperative to advocate for the most promising project in VitaDAO’s IP-NFT portfolio given the high risk associated with early stage biotech research, if we’re going to propose the community take on the risk of the project directly. As such, we commissioned several advisors to Molecule to perform analysis of the data generated to date by all of the VitaDAO projects under NDA. These advisors have asked to remain anonymous, though we can say that they combined have 50 years of academic biomedical research, pharma, biotech, and venture capital experience. They scored each of the VitaDAO projects along several axes, including favorability of licensing terms, quality of experimental planning, commercial viability, clinical strategy, expertise of the research team, and probability of success given the data generated to date. Their feedback was independent and unanimous: Korolchuk’s project is the most promising of all VitaDAO IP-NFTs to generate valuable IP.\n\n## Tokenomics\n1,000,000 VITA-0001 tokens (IP-NFT fraction tokens) will be minted. 10% of the VITA-0001 tokens will be sold to members of VitaDAO in a fixed-price sale. Participants who receive an allocation of VITA-0001 tokens will be subject to a two month lockup period. The purpose of this lockup period is to avoid “pump-and-dump” behavior once VITA-0001 tokens have liquidity. However, this lockup period is relatively short to ensure that new data can be published without significant delay, while ensuring data release can be embargoed during the lockup period. If the lockup period were longer, this would delay the ability of the token holders to see data being generated.\n\nVitaDAO will retain 69% of the VITA-0001 tokens.\n\nResearchers will receive 5%, vested over 4 years, with a 1 year cliff. This vesting period is to incentivize long-term success of the project and discourage falsification of data. This must first be approved by Newcastle.\n\nNewcastle University will receive 1%, vested over 4 years, 1 year cliff. Though this is not required in the contract, it may be a strong signal to other University TTOs, incentivizing them to speed up the licensing process if completed by a deadline. This must first be approved by Newcastle.\n\nVitaDAO Dealflow WG will receive 5%, vested over 4 years, 1 year cliff. Vesting period to incentivize long-term success of the project. This must first be approved by Newcastle.\n\nThe liquidity pool will receive 10%. A liquidity pool on UniswapV3 will be created upon claiming the sale proceeds, matching 10% of the fractions with 100% of the funds raised from the sale.\n\nAll of these numbers can be subject to change once token holders begin governance, as more VITA-0001 tokens can be minted and distributed pursuant to token holder vote.\n\n![](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZtsa3ciwHbYywzDtQX48T4ogNCNwVNn9ujQvs8KdHyan?filename=d8)\n\n## Genesis Sale\nThe genesis sale will be a fixed-price sale with overflow rebates and vesting.\n\n10% of the tokens will be sold to VITA holders at a fixed price. Importantly, this price should not factor in any appreciation or depreciation in the value of the project based on the emergent data as VITA holders should have the power to make that determination once liquidity has been established at the conclusion of the sale.\n\nThe pricing is determined by a cost-based valuation, factoring in committed research costs of 220,358 CHF (245,557 USD), legal and operational costs of 38,563 CHF (43,295 USD), inflation of 23,865 USD (VitaDAO holds USDC so it makes sense to calculate inflation with regard to USDC - calculated with the [US Bureau of Statistics Inflation Calculator)](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm), for a total cost-based valuation of 312,717 USD.\n\n*Note: All mentions of USD are to denote value, not stable coins*\n\nGiven the final valuation, 10% of the VITA-0001 tokens would be valued at 31,271 USD and a price of 0.31271 USD per token. We propose that these funds are raised in [WETH](https://etherscan.io/token/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2), resulting in a price of 0.00018 WETH per token, for a total fundraising amount of 17.63 WETH (at current prices).\n\nThe sale of tokens will occur over a 2-day period during which members of VitaDAO may bid as much money as they are willing to contribute and lock in VITA tokens. The value of each buyer’s bid can be up to the maximum of their VITA holdings locked in the sale contract. The more VITA a buyer locks for a 2-month vesting period, the more that buyer may bid during the sales period. This VITA locking mechanism is to prioritize allocation of VITA-0001 to the members of VitaDAO who have supported the original fundraising for the project.\n\nIf the sales goal of 31,271 USD is not met, then all funds will be returned to funders. If the sales goal is met or exceeded, then the final allocation of fraction tokens will be proportional to each bidder’s fraction of the total bids.\n\nFor example, if Alice bids 40,000 USD and Bob bids 20,000 USD, and Alice and Bob are the only funders, then Alice will receive twice the allocation as Bob (this also means that Alice locked twice as much VITA as Bob).\n\nAny overflow is returned to bidders. For example, Alice and Bob together bid 60,000 USD, but the sale sought to raise 31,271 USD, so there is 28,279 USD in surplus. That surplus overflows and gets returned pro rata, so Alice gets back 19,153 USD and Bob gets back 9,576 USD. At the conclusion of the sale, participants will immediately be able to claim the surplus that overflows.\n\nSale participants receive vested VITA (vVITA) and vested VITA-0001 tokens (vVITA-0001), to ensure they can participate in governance while locked. After the two-month vesting period is over, sales participants will begin to be able to swap their vVITA for VITA and vVITA-0001 for VITA-0001 tokens, with the total amount locked for the full 2-month period.\n\nWhen VitaDAO claims the proceeds from the sale, a Uniswap liquidity pool will be created using the full sales proceeds and 10% of the VITA-0001 tokens at the same price as the sale.\n\n## Liquidity Pool\nAfter the sale is completed, a liquidity pool will be created with another 10% of the total fraction tokens combined with 100% of the funds raised. The starting token price will be equal to the final price of the auction.\n\nTherefore, if the 31,271 USD goal is met then the VITA-0001/WETH pool will be seeded with 31,271 USD matched with 10% of the VITA-0001 tokens (100,000) at a starting price of 0.31271 per Molecule.\n\n## Use of Funds\nThough immediately all funds raised will be leveraged for establishing liquidity, the ultimate intent is for these funds to go toward research and IP development. However, we want the community to have governance here once democratized directly to the community. There is some optionality as to how funds can be leveraged to develop the Newcastle work.\n\nFirst, the funds can be used for decentralizing structure-activity-relationship (SAR) analysis. The Korolchuk lab has a computational biologist in-house, but we believe we can bring the strongest SAR talent from around the world to help determine promising compound scaffolds and design optimal candidates to take into medicinal chemistry optimization. For example, LabDAO has offered to give access to its large network of computational chemists and develop hackathons around analysis of the data being generated from the Korolchuk lab. Given the importance of the decisions made from a hit-to-lead perspective being made in the next few months, having independent consensus by many highly-trained computational chemists would be high-leverage capital that could be deployed with the funds raised.\n\nIn addition, given the breadth of compounds emerging as hits from the screen, not only will SAR analyses be absolutely crucial to down-selecting lead compounds, but so will medicinal chemistry. Experienced and talented medicinal chemists typically cost ~1k USD/day, and capital could be leveraged for medchem as well.\n\nAnother potential use of funds is for filing intellectual property. With the quantity of potential novel compounds coming out of this research, foundational substance of matter patent protection around the best compounds will clearly be essential to increasing the IP value. Contracting patent attorneys to file strong substance of matter and method of use patent applications around each of the (hopefully) many compounds coming from the screen will be high-leverage deployment of the funds.\n\nIn summary, in the short term, the funds from the fundraise will be leveraged for liquidity; however, once governance has been established, there are many routes for reallocating this capital from liquidity to IP generation. This should be a community decision that future IP-NFT fraction holders can get more data and context to help drive efficient decision-making.\n\n## Token Rights and Legal Considerations\nThe VITA-0001 tokens represent membership in an IP pool containing the Korolchuk IP-NFT and its attached IP and R&D data. IP pool membership enables fraction token holders to govern the joint development and experimental use of the IP and R&D data in the pool.\n\nHolders of VITA-0001 tokens have information rights including the right to receive regular, non-confidential updates from the researchers and ask questions to the researcher, as agreed upon with the researcher, as well as obtain confidential information about the research after following appropriate protocols such as KYC/NDA. Fraction holders will have access to data rooms containing the IP and R&D data. Holders of VITA-0001 tokens will have information rights to non-confidential data rooms with the results provided by the researcher to the community to help with the decision making process, with proprietary information will be redacted to protect the integrity of the IP. This data room will remain open continuously and be the mechanism of providing non-confidential updates to fraction holders. Holders of VITA-0001 tokens may also have the opportunity to gain access to confidential data. This data will be highly confidential, thus requiring users to sign confidentiality agreements to safeguard the IP, but allow people to access and contribute to the research or make funding decisions based on this information if they choose.\n\nHolders of VITA-0001 tokens have rights to govern issuance of licenses to use the underlying IP and R&D data attached to the IP-NFT. Control over the licensing function of the IP and R&D data is decentralized through token holder governance.\n\nHolders of VITA-0001 tokens can only distribute proceeds from licensing or sale of the IP and R&D if they exercise their rights to do so through governance. Token holders must make the judgment in the future whether and how to distribute licensing or sale proceeds, such as by forming a legal entity prior to making such distribution.\n\nThe rights of token holders are governed by the [VITA-0001 IP-NFT Fractional Association of Molecules (FAM) Membership Agreement](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYr6daqdSReoq8tHUQMULazviFgj96dpLA4sYUjaRWZcg?filename=Korolchuk-FAM%20Membership%20Agreement.pdf), an adhesion contract holders agree to at points of sale, claim, and voting.\n\nGiven the current regulatory uncertainty in the US with respect to crypto and the aggressive recent actions taken by the SEC, we sought advice from two US law firms and a Swiss law firm, who all recommended to geoblock any buyers from the USA.\n\n# Conclusion\nThis is a brief overview of a potential fractionalization protocol, likely with many open questions from the community. Ultimately, the goal is to get fractional IP-NFT tokens into the hands of the community to drive projects forward and only release a fraction of the governance ownership into the market that allows for price discovery and future, larger, fundraising should it be needed and justified. Our timeline is ASAP, and our entire team at Molecule is hustling to enable this by beginning-mid June if approved by the VitaDAO community.",

ImmuneAGE's lead compound targets the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of the bone marrow, and the screening platform is based on a new method of >1000x expansion of HSCs for bone marrow transplant.\n\n![](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQzpeqggyd8Vhnmy4rpvk8hzGDfGuBkiDhqEPdbC4bfWW?filename=Screenshot%202023-04-05%20at%202.44.01%20PM.png)\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG Team\n**Reviewers**: two scientists, a venture capitalist, and a business expert\n**Shepherd**: Paolo Binetti\n**Other squad members**: Laurence Ion\n**Sourced by**: Tyler Golato\n\n*This proposal is based on the supporting documents provided by ImmuneAGE, as well as questions and answers to their team, and senior reviews.\nThe VITA token holders can ratify the Longevity-Dealflow WG’s assessment via a decentralized vote*\n\n**Project lead**: Sebastian Brunemeier\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nImmuneAGE Pharma is the first platform company focused on immune system rejuvenation. They are targeting immune aging at the source — the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of the bone marrow. The company's lead program, IA101, is a non-toxic small molecule that rejuvenates aged HSCs and aged animal immune function (oral administration) better than any molecule previously published. The company is seeking funding to support the further optimization and preclinical development of the IA101 program. The company is willing to execute an IP-NFT.\n\n## Problem\n\nImmune aging and chronic inflammation drives the major killers and age-related diseases: infectious disease (e.g., COVID), cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, metabolic syndrome, chronic inflammatory conditions and autoimmunity, and tumor immunosurveillance in oncology, etc. COVID has underscored the importance of immune aging — the factor most determinative of death and disability was biological age. Today, lung infection by other pathogens remains the 4th leading cause of death globally. Furthermore, tumors can exist and spread only when the immune system fails to control them. And yet, there has never been a systematic effort to find drugs that rejuvenate the immune system at the source: HSCs.\n\n## Opportunity\n\nHarnessing the immune system is an extremely powerful approach in oncology — the immune-oncology (I/O) revolution, which yielded a Nobel Prize in 2018 — is the hottest area of biopharma today. These methods (checkpoint blockade, T and NK cell therapy, pro-inflammatory cytokines) tend to be “blunt instruments,” revving up the immune systems of patients whose immune systems have already failed (allowing cancer to emerge in the first place).\n\nDespite this evidence for the efficacy of immunotherapy, there are few companies seeking to rejuvenate the entire immune system at the source: the bone marrow and hematopoietic stem cells. The hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of the bone marrow are the most powerful stem cells in the body (aside from the embryonic stem cells during development) — with the highest replicative capacity of any cell type (producing 200 billion red blood cells per day and 10 billion white blood cells). HSCs produce all the blood cells, and when rejuvenated in the lab, can extend the healthy lifespan of lab animals up to 30%.\n\n## Solution\n\nImmuneAGE’s lead program, IA101, is a non-toxic small molecule that rejuvenates aged HSCs and aged animal immune function (oral administration) better than any molecule previously published (to be published in Nature Aging later this year). A less potent natural product analog of IA101 has shown efficacy and safety in multiple human clinical trials, de-risking clinical development.\n\nIA101 was discovered in scientific co-founder, Prof Nicola Vannini’s lab. Dr. Vannini has developed a unique assay for profiling metabolic function of HSCs and other immune cells. This platform enables the high throughput screening of compounds that reprogram immunometabolism. He has identified several molecules that enhance immune function, in vivo and ex vivo, and this platform is able to identify many more at scale. The Vannini lab has shown that metabolic reprogramming agents can enhance HSC function in vivo, as a first proof of concept for the platform. This compound is not drug-like, but Prof Vannini has since found other active scaffolds in vitro and in vivo, including an analog of our lead program, IA101 (Nature Aging, in revision).\n\n## Plan and IP roadmap\n\nWith proceeds from VitaDAO, ImmuneAGE will develop new IA101 analogs in order to strengthen their IP, enhance potency and drug-likeness, and identify the molecular target. With ImmuneAGE’s unique screening platform, they will be able to quickly iterate the new candidates to select a final pre-clinical candidate to move towards IND.\n\nImmuneAge will file intellectual property around the optimized IA101 derivatives discovered from the funding of this project.\n\n## Financing and cost breakdown\n\nThe current financing, future financing commitments, combined with potential funding from the VitaDAO community, would cover the following activities:\n* HTS for HSC rejuvenator compounds with University collaboration - 200k\n* Medical Chemistry to synthesize novel derivatives of IA101 - 250k\n* Validation of top compounds in HSC transplant mouse models - 200k\n* Target ID studies for IA101 and related molecules - 150k\n\nThe primary  costs are with medicinal chemistry in collaboration with WuXi and medicinal chemist consulting budget.\n\n## Team\n\n* **Sebastian Brunemeier**, CEO and Founder: Sebastian A.

      "content": "# Summary\nThis proposal establishes an internal independent working group within VitaDAO. It describes the Group’s purpose, goals, and rationale for its activities. This proposal does not seek the creation of new salaried positions in addition to the ones the DAO is already hiring for.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE:**\n\n1. When we talk about token utility, we mean the utility value of the token to the DAO members, e.g. qualifying for partner discounts, access to services, etc. It does not refer to the monetary value of the token. It also does not purport to change the token to a “utility token” from a governance token. That’s not only impossible without a community vote, it would be irrational to do so.\n2. When talking about accelerating research assets, we are not talking about profits. We are emphasizing that sustainability of the treasury must be reached without depending purely on donations and strategic investors.\n\n# Relevance to the 2023 Strategic Plan and Seasonal Governance Goals\nThis proposal aims to directly address major aspects of the following goals from the VitaDAO 2023 Strategic Plan 4:\n\n* Increase Token Utility Value\n* Liquify Research Assets\n\nThis proposal also directly addresses the Seasonal Governance Goal 0.3 - Accelerate Research Assets.\n\nThis document proposes a concrete strategy to achieve these goals by founding the Commercialization Squad, an independent working group within VitaDAO. The goals of the group are specific and measurable, making tracking achievements possible.\n\nAchievement of the Squad’s goals also indirectly positively affects increasing community size as well as increasing brand awareness, which are key goals in the 2023 Strategic Plan as well.\n\n# Motivation\n**Background: How VitaDAO Operates**\nVitaDAO funds researchers, research labs, early-stage startups, and projects in the longevity space. Projects are sourced, sometimes incubated, and significant efforts are put into evaluation. Usually, such vetted longevity research projects will request funds from VitaDAO, and members will vote to grant or raise those funds in exchange for ownership in part of the resulting IP or other assets, or in some cases equity.\n\nTo increase the value of its treasury, VitaDAO’s original plan mentions licensing or selling the DAO’s IP or data to industry stakeholders, such as pharmaceutical or biotech companies, and allows the possibility of bringing these assets to market itself, provided enough liquidity and governance sophistication exists.\n\nThe $VITA token is a central component of the VitaDAO ecosystem. $VITA tokens grant rights to participate in decision-making within the DAO. The token grants no ownership of IP to the token holder. Instead, it grants full governance rights. As a governance token, its economy has not been optimized to lead to its increase in value. Rather, $VITA follows the sustainability loop principle: in theory, as R&D projects receive funds and begin producing data, VitaDAO’s IP value grows with positive research results, and the proceeds flow back to the treasury. The value of this principle applied by the DAO, however, needs to be recognized by the market.\n\nThe value and utility of $VITA is important for another reason in addition to its role in governance. Until VitaDAO is able to achieve a significant exit, i.e. by selling the equity or licensing the IP acquired by funding a project, it may have to rely on raising funding by selling $VITA. Given the projects funded by VitaDAO so far are very early stage, it’s safe to assume a significant exit may be years away.\n\nThere are currently limited strategies in place to increase the treasury’s value. The current tokenomics strategy excludes investment speculation with community funds to minimize risk. In order to achieve its goals, VitaDAO currently relies heavily on community and Strategic Member funding.\n\nVitaDAO’s community has gained significant experience in the last two years of pursuing its mission, and the need has arisen to design more sophisticated management instruments for several elements of its operations, including the role of $VITA in the larger longevity ecosystem as well as the pre- and post-funding relationship with projects VitaDAO funds.\n\n**Learnings and needs**\n\nThe list below focuses on commercial, financial, and market-oriented learnings from the VitaDAO community in the last two years. It’s non-exhaustive.\n\n1. Financial sustainability\n\na. As expected for biotech projects, return on investments may need years to be realized. VitaDAO’s financing strategy may not be able to depend purely on Strategic Members and community financing for an extended period of time, given market instability and the need to prove (i.e. show success metrics) the community can achieve financial ROI and become a self-sustainable organization.\n\nb. Many of the founders VitaDAO meets and decides to finance are running very early-stage projects or startups. They may not have formed the founding team, may be specialized scientists with little business/funding experience, and thus may need hands-on assistance in many of the aspects that increase the chances of raising financing rounds.\n\nc. IP-NFTs are not yet as broadly accepted nor established in the biotech and longevity funding space as, for example, royalty or equity agreements. Though they have a clear utility for academic collaborations, significant effort and time investment in the popularization of IP-NFTs may be needed in order to reach VitaDAO’s goal of funding projects primarily via IP-NFTs. \n\nd. Some aspects of project sourcing, evaluation, and financing need to be strengthened. There is currently a vacancy for a venture associate 1 and other positions within the dealflow area, but more formal positions may be needed.\n\ne. The current token model of governance-only is risk-averse and in line with the DAO’s values. However, we recognize that the potential for $VITA lies beyond purely being used for the DAO’s governance purposes, such as becoming “in-game currency” for longevity-related apps, products, and systems. Any token uses for $VITA beyond governance will need to be reviewed and approved by the VitaDAO community.\n\n2. Popularization of VitaDAO, $VITA, IP-NFTs\n\na. VitaDAO is becoming a more important and recognizable player in the longevity space with each financed project.\n\nb. There is a yet unexploited potential for $VITA to play a role in the space, such as becoming “in-game currency” for longevity-related apps, products, and systems. While preserving the risk-averse tokenomics approach and having in mind the original governance design of the token, a stronger role of $VITA in the space may enable VitaDAO to offer membership benefits to its community, popularize the DAO and IP-NFTs, and accelerate the achievement of its goals.\n\n# Specification\n**The Vita Commercialization Squad**\n\nA small group of dedicated, experienced people can address all of the needs listed above. This Squad acts as an independent pod or working group within the DAO, ensuring agility, focus, and accountability.\n\nIt functions based on a yearly Plan it submits to the Stewards; the community then votes to approve it. The Plan is designed to clearly describe the Squad’s objectives, activities, and most importantly, how the achievement of the objectives will be measured as well as how the Squad generates value and revenues for VitaDAO (see below section on Outcome-Based rewards). The plan details the Squad’s budget and planned expenses.\n\nThe Squad is an internal service provider to the DAO’s working groups, within the constraints of its Plan.\n\nGiven the fact the Squad’s work is financed by the DAO, ensuring accountability is of utmost importance. The Squad prepares reports and presents its work to the community as necessary, and at the very least bi-yearly. Achievement of the Squad’s metrics established in the Plan directly affects the Squad member’s compensation. The Stewards oversee the achievement of the Squad’s objectives and hold the Squad members accountable.\n\n## Goals of the Squad\n1. Increase the likelihood of commercial success for the projects VitaDAO finances according to pre-agreed metrics and goals\n\n2. Assist project teams pre- and post-financing with administrative, fundraising, operational and strategic planning needs; in some cases serving as fractional CEO, CFO, COO, or advisor, and creating a Venture Studio-like environment as needed\n\n3. Generate value and revenues for VitaDAO (see below section on Outcome-Based rewards)\n\n4. Establish projects’ needs for scientific assistance (e.g. SIR) and source candidates from within VitaDAO and the broad community\n\n5. Active promotion of the DAO with TTOs and projects in line with the relevant policies (which are subject to change), as updated\n\n6. Detailed design and active implementation of the DTT concept 1 as prioritized by the DAO\n\n7. Establish $VITA as the “longevity token” through working with other non-profit organizations or with companies in the sector, especially focusing on its use as “in-game currency” for relevant apps and systems\n\n8. Design and proposal of other uses of $VITA to increase benefits to its holders and VitaDAO and its members; coordinates such activities with the Coordination WG and specifically those members working on tokenomics\n\n**Team**\nThe Squad is led by the Builder. The Builder is an entrepreneur-in-residence with a startup mentality and approach to work. The Builder understands VitaDAO is a relatively early-stage startup, and that his/her job description includes wearing multiple hats as necessary. The Builder proposes the Squad’s yearly plan, hires group members, and is responsible for the achievement of the Goals of the Squad.\n\nThe Builder may fully or partially perform the EIR role (job description as currently published here 1) and can be hired from the currently advertised positions. In addition, the Builder:\n\n1. Serves as the first point of contact representing VitaDAO for projects post-financing, unless deemed otherwise by the Stewards\n\n2. Builds relationships with researchers, operators in the aging & longevity space as VitaDAO’s representative\n\n3. Takes on the CEO/CFO/COO mantle at portfolio companies as needed and speaks about the company products and research with founder-level knowledge\n\n4. Designs and proposes uses of $VITA to increase benefits to the VitaDAO community; serves as a business developer with companies in the field\n\nThe Builder may hire for other positions, as described in the Squad’s yearly plan and within the community-approved budget.\n\nCommunity members may act as a broader support team for the Squad as projects necessitate.\n\n### Outcome-based Rewards\n\nThe Squad must generate tangible, measurable value for VitaDAO. Whether these are in the form of successful integration of $VITA by companies in the longevity field, or in the form of equity, data, or IP in any form in exchange for the assistance provided to projects the DAO finances, creating revenues is at the heart of the Squad’s mission.\n\nThe Squad’s members’ are rewarded subject to the VitaDAO compensation policy (VDP 72 1 as of this time). The parts especially relevant to the Squad are the Compensation Framework (Part II) and Appendix D (Tech and Product Contributor Compensation).\n\nIn some cases where this is possible and legally permissible, and with the permission of the company/project legal representative, the DAO may offer a fraction of equity, data or IP as supplementary compensation to the Squad’s members involved in a company-building project.\n\n**Project Lead:** Eli Mo\n\n# Budget\n**Yearly budget**\n\nThe Squad’s yearly budget is proposed in their Plan, and reviewed every six months based on the achievement of the Squad’s metrics, except in the first year when it is reviewed every four months. Should either the reviewers or the Builder propose the altering of the Squad’s budget after the review or at any point, a community vote is launched.\n\nThe Squad uses the budget for service provider fees, travel as needed, and itemizes all expenses in its reports. The Builder may approve any expenses not foreseen in the Plan below $5000 total only if any budget line is not altered by more than 20% or the budget by 2% total. Any expenses not foreseen in the Plan that do not fit within this formula need to be approved by the community.\n\n**First instance of the Squad (March-July 2023)**\n\nThe first instance of the Squad will be a 4-month trial for the Builder position only, to be extended for an additional year if goals are met. The person applying to be the prospective Builder will propose a workplan for these 4 months within the scope of the Squad’s goals, and work closely with the Stewards to develop a detailed yearly plan.\n\n*No budget for the Squad is requested for this first trial period, i.e. the seasonal governance budget will be used as stated in the Goals.*\n\n# TL;DR\n* This proposal establishes the Commercialization Squad, whose goals are to increase the $VITA token utility value and commercialize VitaDAO’s assets\n* The Squad assists projects/companies pre- and post-financing with administrative, fundraising, operational and strategic planning needs\n* The Squad’s work is accountable, measurable and presented to the community\n* Approval of a trial period of 4 months is requested from the community; hiring the team lead (Builder) from the currently open positions\n* No budget is requested for the trial period\n* Squad members are compensated as per the DAO compensation policy",

      "title": "VDP-72 Proposal to Approve the Compensation Policy for 2023",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nVitaDAO has been providing compensation to contributors based around [VDP-3](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-3-vitadao-tokenomics-proposal/64/32), [VDP-26.1](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-26-1-dealflow-structure-incentives/447/21) and using soft governance within VitaCore.\n\nWhile this has worked to this point, a more formal, transparent compensation policy is required to give certainty to contributors and the community on how VitaDAO is facilitating the activities and projects it undertakes.\n\nThis proposal seeks to ratify the Compensation Policy described below.\n\n**UPDATE: Please see revised version of document here:** https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdnQpm8dqetyGZApV8eXG3JaSWLZKuR7Hc9j1cQbZHH2P?filename=VitaDAO%20Compensation%20Policy%20v2%20(2).pdf\n\n# Motivation\n\nVitaDAO is a community which is funding early stage research in the longevity and healthspan field with the goal of incubating promising research and translating intellectual property into investable biopharma startups.\n\nMembers of the community include mission-aligned enthusiasts, researchers and investors which individually bring a wide cross section of skill sets and experiences to VitaDAO.\n\nAt the base, many in the community volunteer for VitaDAO activities based on personal or professional interests. Others contribute financially to provide VitaDAO resources to deploy into research, while our researcher community members review proposed projects and bring forward research ideas which may result in future intellectual property and commercialization opportunities.\n\nWhile many members contribute a relatively small number of hours to a specific project or interest within VitaDAO, VitaDAO also has a group of highly dedicated and motivated contributors whose involvement are consistent, time intensive, and whose skill sets are valued and needed by VitaDAO to fulfil its operational goals.\n\n$VITA tokens are seen as a way to reward valuable contributions to the community through a greater stake in, and ability to influence, VitaDAO's direction and decision making. However, a number of the tasks within VitaDAO are time consuming, require market-valued skills, and in the cases of specific roles, carries an opportunity cost to members in terms of pursuing other employment or contract opportunities.\n\nIn these cases, VitaDAO recognizes the need to compensate those members whose involvement and effort bring value to VitaDAO but also limits their ability to work on other projects or opportunities.\n\nTo date the plan, as described below, has been the basis of compensation since July (1 year anniversary) as a soft governance within VitaCore on a probationary basis, and it is the intention of this proposal to ratify the Compensation Policy for DAO-wide use.\n\n# Specification\n\nAs the length of the document precludes inclusion inline in Discourse, please visit the following for information regarding the Long-term Incentive Plan (L-TIP) and Tokenomics proposed:\n\nCompensation Policy Appendix E: https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmP6rdhJySzzBY2smMTCTQYiJbofLt8qp4HhY8pFRfd8Zg?filename=Incentives%20Worksheet_L1D_proposal%20(1).xlsx\n\n# Implementation\n\nUpon successful passing of this proposal, the Coordination Working Group will apply this policy to all current and future contributors and squad/working group positions.\n\nAdditional role descriptions will be developed to facilitate other functions within VitaDAO and added to this document subject to the approval of the compensation framework described herein.\n\n## Budget\n\nThe short-term and long-term incentive plan in this proposal anticipates an additional minting of up to approximately 12.6m $VITA (19.6% of Total Token Supply), as needed, between now and the end of 2026 to provide governance allocations to contributors across the DAO.\n\nAll allocations are subject to a lock-up and vesting schedule similar to that contemplated in [VDP-67](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-67-governance-vita-allocations-for-more-dealflow-contributors/979). *The allocations in VDP-67 are already included as part of this proposal.*\n\n",

      "title": " SG 0.3c - Creating VitaTech - a US-based NewCo to obtain government funding for longevity research ",
      "content": "# Summary\n*One-Liner*: VitaDAO to Establish VitaTech, a US-Based For-Profit Company to License Longevity Technologies from US Universities and Research Institutions and, Raise Non-Dilutive Funding to Develop Them into Commercializable Assets\n\nThere are numerous exciting longevity-related research projects being undertaken in US universities and national labs, but most of these projects never reach the commercialization or investable stage. Advancing a good candidate to the FDA-ready IND stage requires $3-5M in funding, which is beyond the current scope of VitaDAO’s funding. There is an opportunity to leverage non-dilutive funding from foundations and the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) programs to advance these technologies to commercialization stages. To achieve this, we propose to form a US-based for-profit company called VitaTech, which will licence longevity technologies developed in US universities, apply for non-dilutive funding from SBIR/STTR and foundations, and develop the technologies into commercializable assets. VitaTech will operate as a subsidiary/affiliate of VitaDAO.\n\n# Relevance to Strategic Plan\nCreation of VitaTech will accelerate the acquisition and development of research assets. The establishment of VitaTech will accelerate VitaDAO’s mission by facilitating the development of selected technologies and leveraging public funding. VitaTech will play a crucial role in bringing these technologies to market, benefiting not only the NIH but also the wider public.\n\n# Budget\nThe proposed budget is for $50K from VitaDAO to get VitaTech up and running and to apply for its first two grants. This amount and any ongoing charges would be paid back to VitaDAO from any awarded grant. VitaTech will commit to return a portion of any receipts (e.g., drug sales, license purchases, and/or any other ROI) to VitaDAO treasury.\n\n# VitaDAO’s available funds\nFor context, (as of Feb 1st, 2023) VitaDAO funded 15+ projects with $3.5m+, and has ~$4.5m in liquid funds remaining (before further fundraising), which will be used for:\n\n* Funding new projects\n* Operations, including sourcing, incubation, evaluation, & community growth\n* Follow-on funding, including for projects VitaDAO will spin out\n\n# Motivation\nThe primary objective of VitaTech will be to accelerate the commercialization of longevity technologies through a search and build approach. On behalf and in close collaboration with the VitaDAO community, VitaTech will search technology transfer databases of US universities (e.g., UCLA), federal research institutions (e.g., NIH), and identify promising longevity technologies. VitaTech will gain access to these technologies through licensing agreements and/or Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) if agreed on a project per project basis by VitaDAO. VitaTech will apply for non-dilutive funding from SBIR/STTR and foundations to advance these technologies to commercialization stages (e.g., performing additional experiments to satisfy IND submission requirements).\n\n# Specification\n\n**Project Team**\nVitaTech’s management team will be composed of experienced professionals from the VitaDAO community with expertise in technology licensing, product development, and business development. The team will be responsible for identifying licensing opportunities, negotiating licensing agreements, managing the development of the licensed technologies, and overseeing the commercialization of the resulting products on behalf of and in close collaboration with VitaDAO following governance and operational processes established by VitaDAO. The management team will also be responsible for managing the company’s finances and applying for non-dilutive funding. The current team consists of Tuan Dinh, Eli Mohamad and Tim Peterson\n\n# Implementation\n\n**Success Metrics**: Number of projects that are funded by nondilutive fundings. Number of startup spinouts. Total funding raised.\n\n**Timeline**: 2 projects in 2023 and 5 in 2024",

      "title": " SG 0.3b - Molecule Dealflow and Development Services ",
      "content": "# Simple Summary\n*Note: This proposal was originally submitted as VDP-84 and is now being resubmitted as part of seasonal governance.*\n\nMolecule provides a range of services to VitaDAO’s research projects (detailed below). Historically, fees for these services have been paid in cash from the VitaDAO treasury. This proposal is an offer to the VitaDAO community to pay for Molecule’s IP services in sweat equity (% ownership in IP), as opposed to cash. In order to promote long-term incentive alignment and protect VitaDAO’s cash treasury, Molecule proposes instead of cash, a co-investment right defined as an option to earn, through provision of services, equity in IP-NFTs.\n\n# Relevance to the 2023 Strategic Plan and Seasonal Governance Goals\nThis proposal aims to directly address the “Liquify Research Assets” goal from the VitaDAO 2023 Strategic Plan 3.\n\nThis proposal also directly addresses the Seasonal Governance goal 0.3 - Accelerate Research Assets.\n\n# Motivation\nSupporting VitaDAO’s deal flow and development is time-consuming, requiring the equivalent of several full-time employees to review and negotiate the terms of research agreements, support VitaDAO working groups, and execute project financing.\n\nTo date, Molecule’s fee for these services has been 10-15% of the cash amount of funding for the research sponsored via IP-NFT. This is unsustainable over the long term as it depletes VitaDAO’s treasury which is better spent funding longevity research. Recognizing that, starting from the time of the funding of the University of Washington IP-NFT, Molecule agreed with members of longevity-dealflow and VitaCORE leading the deals that it would be willing to accept a percentage of the IP-NFTs instead of cash, leaving the final percentage of IP-NFT assigned to Molecule to be determined via public VitaDAO governance.\n\nThis proposal is in furtherance of such public governance.\n\nOur goals are the following:\n\n* Promote the best IP-NFTs and work to make them successfully spun out assets;\n* Identify the best economic opportunities for IP-NFTs and assist VitaDAO in out-licensing IP;\n* Align incentives long term in promoting the best IP-NFTs to clinical trials and commercialization;\n* Design and implement an efficient and robust IP-NFT distribution system through fractionalization; and,\n* Ensure the longevity of VitaDAO’s treasury and long-term success of VitaDAO.\n* The outcome of this proposal will be formalized in a service agreement drafted by a Tier-1 US IP law firm and, when ready, smart contracts.\n\n# Specification\nFor the right to earn sweat equity in IP-NFTs, Molecule will continue to support a deal-flow and development team to work with VitaDAO on research funding and other projects with the core services specified below. For context, this offer of equity participation in lieu of cash is based on Molecule’s services which it currently offers as part of developing VitaDAO’s IP-NFT portfolio, namely:\n\n* TTO/Deal Negotiation\n-- We have 1-2 team members dedicated to negotiating with TTOs. This is a laborious process taking anywhere from 1-3 months. See below for a detailed breakdown of time and cost/deal.\n* Deal Structuring\n-- We have created standard deals, licenses, and terms favorable to VitaDAO. We are working with Tier 1 law firms to review and improve them at our expense and to implement a harmonized dual IP-NFT/equity business model.\n* Legal Risk\n-- We are the primary signer of all VitaDAO deals with universities. We incur legal risk on behalf of the DAO, taking agency in closing deals and assigning our rights to the DAO via IP-NFT.\n* Research Administration and Research Management\n-- We will work with researchers to gather interim reports, advise on research direction, help structure incoming data, and ensure timely accounting and controlling.\n* Funding and Co-Investment\n-- We will support and invest into IP-NFTs funded by VitaDAO, helping to de-risk the investments over the long term by sharing the cost/burden of funding additional research milestones with VitaDAO.\n* IP-NFT product development\n-- We are working to develop the IP-NFT framework to VitaDAO’s custom specifications, including self-service minting and fractionalization infrastructure.\n* Artwork creation for IP-NFTs\n-- We have funded and developed custom artwork for the IP-NFTs.\n* Fundraising\n-- We will help with fundraising for IP-NFTs from strategic partners and Molecule investors.\n* Spin-out Creation\n-- We will assist in the creation and development of spin-out companies for the most promising projects among VitaDAO’s IP-NFTs and offer initial executive management services.\n\nFor existing IP-NFTs already minted where Molecule accepted a handshake agreement for sweat equity rather than a cash fee, the proposed amounts are 10% of the IP-NFT inclusive of the Jonathan An IP-NFT and for every IP-NFT since that time.\n\nLooking forward, we propose that the percentage of IP-NFT earned by Molecule is decided on a case-by-case basis with the VitaDAO longevity-dealflow working group.\n\n# Cost Breakdown per Deal\nThe total cost per funded deal for Molecule breaks down to $25,000-$30,000 USD across negotiation time, legal, artwork, and additional services. This does not include any costs once the deal is actually funded, such as time for research management, review, spin out and fundraising support, etc.\n\n# TTO and Deal Negotiations\n**Time investment breakdown per project for VitaDAO**\n|  | Number of deals evaluated/negotiated/worked on for VitaDAO |\n| ----- | ----- | \n| Academic | 24 |\n| Biotech | 30 |\n| Total | 54 | \n| Average time investment | 7.9 | \n| Deals funded by VitaDAO and supported by Molecule | 5 | \n\n**Activity breakdown in hours on average per project**\n| | Average hours per activity and project |\n| ----- | ----- | \n| Evaluation science/business/IP| \t2.8| \n| pre-IP call| \t1.0| \n| Relationship building| \t1.0| \n| General deal structuring| \t1.5| \n| Negotiation of deal terms| \t1.1| \n| Closing deal| \t0.2| \n| IP-NFT minting and marketing| \t0.3| \n**Activity breakdown in percentage on average per project**\t\n| | Average workload distribution per activity and project| \n| ----- | ----- | \n| Evaluation science/business/IP| \t36.1| \n| pre-IP call| \t12.7| \n| Relationship building| \t12.0| \n| General deal structuring| \t19.0| \n| Negotiation of deal terms| \t13.4| \n| Closing deal| \t2.7| \n| IP-NFT minting and marketing| \t4.1| \n\n| Total number of hours| \t441.0| \n| ----- | ----- | \n| Average number of hours per project| \t7.9| \n| Calculated average costs per project in USD with a consulting fee of USD 250 per hour| \t1975| \n| Calculated average costs per funded deal in USD with a consulting fee of USD 250 per hour (1 out of every 11.2 deals funded)| \t22120| \n\n# Legal Review\nInternal Legal Review USD: \t1000 - 2000\nTier 1 Law Firm Legal Review:\t2500 - 5000\n# Artwork\nProfessional Illustrator (External):\t3000-4000\nInternal Designer:\t1000\n# Molecule’s Organization Structure\nOur services to VitaDAO are organized into different teams:\n\nResearch & Development\n\nThis team monitors the scientific research landscape engaging with researchers, companies, and universities interested in funding from VitaDAO using IP-NFTs. After identifying interesting funding opportunities, the R&D team evaluates the scientific and market opportunity, negotiates deal terms, signs research agreements, and assigns them to VitaDAO.\n\nTech/Product\n\nThis team develops the IP-NFT infrastructure used by VitaDAO to scale its portfolio.\n\nLegal & Compliance\n\nThis team monitors regulations that apply to VitaDAO’s activities, ensuring compliance, and reviews terms for VitaDAO’s sponsored research agreements.\n\n# Fees\nMolecule earns a co-investment right defined as an option to purchase with cash or earn using labor %s of IP-NFTs minted by VitaDAO throughout the term of the engagement under this agreement.\n\n# Termination\nVitaDAO may terminate Molecule’s engagement under this agreement for any reason by way of VitaDAO community governance.

Payments are done retroactively on a bounty basis, through Ambassador activities, so anyone regardless of credentials can have the opportunity to prove themselves.\n\n# Specification\n**Project Leads**: Cat & Gavin\n**Team Members**: @Shift @jengajojo\n\n# Criteria to be an Ambassador\n## General criteria\n\n* “Pass” a screening call where we verify that they are who they say they are\n* Conservational level of English (don’t have to be good, but they have to be able to communicate with us)\n* Able to submit a credible-looking plan for their Ambassador activities (will talk to these communities, will talk about VitaDAO at these events, etc.)\n* Pass a “training” (could be recorded videos or a notion page) on VitaDAO programs\n### Things we especially look for\n\n* Local connections to 1 or more of these communities: web3, academic / medical research, biohacking, venture\n### Payment and reimbursement\n\n* We generally don’t reimburse Ambassadors to go to events, but we do make exceptions on a case by case basis (only for experienced Ambassadors with a track record)\n* The first 3 events by an Ambassador, we will only approve a grant for expenses to host the event (no extra payment)\n* The 4th event or later by an Ambassador, we provide a payment bounty\n-- $100 - $200 USD min. with a sliding bonus based on views and attendees\n-- Might also add a “referral” and commission mechanism in the future\n* In the future, we will add bounties for “conversions” (e.g. new regular contributors, project application…)\n# Event Approval Process\nEvents will only qualify for reimbursements and/or payment if pre-approved by VitaDAO. VitaDAO approves events based on the DAO’s budget, strategic and community needs, the event proposal, and the Ambassador’s track records.\n\n# Implementation\n**Success Metrics**\n\nIntermediate metrics: number of ambassadors, number of events organized\n\nTerminal metrics: number of active contributors gained from ambassador activities\n\n# Budget and Timeline\nWe propose to allocate a budget of $20k to the Ambassador program in Season 0.\n\n$5k will be spent on the operation of the program, which includes:\n\n* Creating an ambassador application process\n* Promotion for the initial ambassadors\n* Finding ambassadors in Discord and local communities, talking with them to evolve the program design to make it more attractive\n* Creating presentation kits, brochures, email templates, posters, and other materials to support ambassador’s outreach and presentation efforts\n* Operationalizing program activities: ambassador onboarding, meetups,…\n\n$15k will be spent on expenses and payments to Ambassadors. This will allow us to facilitate hosting 5-8 in-person events worldwide, and facilitate digital outreach to ~30 communities.",

      "content": "*One liner: VitaDAO and the Gorbunova Lab are launching Matrix Bio, a cutting-edge research venture leveraging the anti-cancer and pro-longevity effects of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid from naked mole rat to human.*\n\n# Longevity Dealflow Team\n- **Scientific evaluation:** Sebastian Brunemeier, Tim Peterson, Rhys Anderson, Koen De Lombaert\n- **Business evaluation:** Sebastian Brunemeier, Tim Peterson\n- **Shepherd/Sourced by:** Tyler Stahl\n- **Squad members:** Paolo Binetti, Rhys Anderson, Rakhan Aimbetov, Ryan Spangler\n- **Project PI:** Vera Gorbunova\n\n# Simple Summary\nNaked mole rats (NMR) are long-lived rodents with a lifespan of up to 40 years, compared to normal rats which live about three years. Unlike other rodents, NMR are found to be cancer resistant. Previous research by the Gorbunova lab has demonstrated cancer resistance in NMR is modulated by the abundance of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid (HMW-HA) in tissues (1). Additional research has demonstrated that transgenic mice expressing naked mole rat hyaluronan synthase gene (NHAS2) have less tumours, improved health, and live 10% longer than mice without the transgene (2). To increase HA in human patients and translate these findings into the clinic, this project will screen and develop small molecule inhibitors of hyaluronidases, the enzymes that break down hyaluronic acid. These compounds can be used for cancer treatment and are expected to increase human healthspan and lifespan.\n\n[VDP-45 on Decentralised Tech Transfer (DTT)](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-45-decentralized-tech-transfer-dtt/689) outlined a new model of funding which, in collaboration with academic partners, conducts experiments at CRO or “fee-for-service” academic facilities. In brief, DTT allows for greater efficiency with treasury resources, speed of project initiation, and the ability to reward research collaborators for their effort.\n\nVitaDAO is launching a newco with the Gorbunova lab, called Matrix Bio. A term sheet has been signed, with the deal terms below that entails the incorporation of Matrix Bio.\n \n![matrix_bio.png](ipfs://bafkreic24v2ttejppcvzb5vswweaogw5mqunnk7bk5owqfn3bz44fcblxu)\n\n# Problem\nThe overall population is aging, and aging is the major risk factor for nearly all human diseases, e.g., cardiovascular disease, cancer, arthritis, cataracts, osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s disease, to name a few. Cancer, specifically, accounted for an approximately 10 million deaths worldwide and had an estimated 19.3 million new cases in 2020 (3).\n\nWhile cancer progression is predominantly associated with genetic driver mutations, a number of other critical factors have been identified that facilitate cancer initiation and progression, offering new therapeutic opportunities in cancer treatment. The tumour microenvironment is one such component, consisting of tumour cells, tumour stromal cells, endothelial cells, immune cells, and non-cellular components of extracellular matrix (ECM). Through complex signalling networks, tumour cells have the ability to use non-malignant cells to their own advantage, consequently leading to tumour formation and maintenance (4).\n\nHA, a long polysaccharide found in the ECM, plays a multifactorial role in tumour suppression and progression (depending on the polymer size) through interactions with HA receptors such as CD44. Cancer initiation results in changes in HA organisation and processing including increased HA synthesis and expression of hyaluronidases, resulting in the fragmentation of HA. LMW-HA is known to promote neo-angiogenesis, tumor cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. Contrary, HMW-HA promotes tissue homeostasis and prevents tissue metastasis, through CD44 interactions and signalling (5,6).\n\n# Opportunity\nUsing exceptionally long-lived and cancer-resistant animals provides a strategy to identify molecular mechanisms that support longevity and healthspan, potentially uncovering novel targets and/or pathways for translation to humans. NMR, based on their size, would not be expected to live past six years, yet in some cases, live beyond 30 years. NMR also rarely get cancer, are resistant to some types of pain, and can survive up to 18 minutes without oxygen. At advanced ages, their mortality rate remains lower than any other mammal that has been documented. As such, the NMR’s biology has garnered great interest from ageing researchers.\n\nBased on published work by the applicant, where it was found that NMR cancer resistance is conferred by abundant HMW-HA in tissue (1), the authors propose to design inhibitors against hyaluronidases, the enzymes that normally degrade HA. Furthermore, very-high-molecular-weight HA (vHMW-HA) has superior cytoprotective properties compared to the shorter HMW-HA, protecting both human and mouse cells from stress-induced cell-cycle arrest and cell death (7). The team has already identified two targets worth pursuing and prioritised one of them (not disclosed here for IP protection).\n\nMost recently, the Gorbunova lab has found that transgenic mice that express the NMR hyaluronan synthase gene have less cancer, show improved health, and live 10% longer than mice without the transgene, supporting that higher levels of HA promote healthy living and longevity (2). While humans cannot produce vHMW-HA, it is possible to increase HMW-HA and decrease LMW-HA by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks hyaluronans down. The aims of the proposed studies now intend to develop and validate inhibitors in order to translate these research findings into clinical applications.\n\n# IP Roadmap\nThe Gorbunova lab has designed a complex and validating functional screening assay to find inhibitors of hyaluronidases. A previous ~3k compound screen has led to discovery of one natural product that increases the levels of HA in mouse and human tissues. IP will include formulations and/or modifications of this natural product. Within the framework of the present proposal the team plans to perform larger compound high throughput screen (HTS) with the proprietary hyaluronidase inhibition assay and medicinal chemistry optimization of hits to produce patentable new chemical entities.\n\n# Budget\nA financing of up to USD 300k provided by VitaDAO, with up to $200k allocated to HTS and exploratory medicinal chemistry with a 3rd party CRO or academic ‘fee for service’ facility, and up to $100k allocated to the Gorbunova lab for hit compound experiments.\n\n- $5k/month will be allocated towards consulting agreement\n- Program 1: HTS and med chem for new  inhibitors\n  - Phase 1: High Throughput Screening (HTS) –  up to $100k\n  - Phase 2: Medicinal Chemistry on hits – up $100k\n- Program 2: Validation of existing in vivo active inhibitor (EC50 ~ 20 µM)\n  - Administration of hit compound to mouse models of cancer to test for curative and preventative effects - up to $100k\n\nFunds will be used to assist in cover the costs related to:\n\n- Technician effort\n- Mouse cost\n- Chemical cost\n- Culturing human cancer cell lines for xenografts\n- Mouse evaluation for tumour burden\n\n# Milestones/Endpoint\nMilestones to be agreed in separate full length R&D plan.\n\n# Team\n**Vera Gorbunova, PhD**\n\nVera Gorbunova is an endowed Professor of Biology and Medicine at the University of Rochester and a co-director of the Rochester Aging Research Center. Her research is focused on understanding the mechanisms of longevity and on the studies of exceptionally long-lived mammals. Dr. Gorbunova pioneered a comparative biology approach to study aging. She elucidated the mechanisms that control evolution of tumor suppressor mechanisms. She uncovered the function of the longevity gene Sirtuin 6 in regulating genome stability across species. She demonstrated the role of transposable elements in driving age-related inflammation. Her work received awards from the Ellison Medical Foundation, the Glenn Foundation, AFAR, and NIH. Her work was recognized by the Cozzarelli Prize from PNAS, prize for research on aging from ADPS/Allianz, France, Prince Hitachi Prize in Comparative Oncology, Japan and Davey Prize from Wilmot Cancer Center.\n\n## Highlights\n- A novel idea from a world-leader in the field with extensive experience in longevity and healthspan mechanisms\n- Strong published and supporting evidence for the target\n- May work against many types of cancer – high impact\n- May address other Extracellular Matrix (ECM) and skin-related conditions, as well as: wound healing, arthritis and joint conditions\n- Validated tool compound identified – showing that this target is druggable\n- Strong IP potential with possible novel chemical matter (to be identified)\n\n## Risks\n- Hyaluronidase inhibition may not be effective to improve health - most clinical hyaluronic acid data is limited to dermatology (skin aging), so unclear if it would work systemically to increase life/health span and reduce cancer in humans\n- Very novel and therefore still high-risk\n- Mixed literature evidence on the role of hyaluronan in metastasis\n- The authors previously published (Takasugi et al., 2020) that several cytoprotective effects of hyaluronic acid are driven specifically by vHMM-HA (>6MDa), which may be dependent on two naked mole rat-unique amino acid variations in the active site of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) and thus may not able to be produced in human cells even with hyaluronidase inhibition\n- Potential impact on the efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy if taken in combination\n\n## Senior Reviews\n### Senior Reviewers\nThis proposal has been reviewed by 8 senior reviewers, including: scientists, biotech business experts, a venture capitalist, and an MD.\n\n\n### Qualitative Evaluation\nThe PI is a world leader in the field of comparative biology with a focus on longevity and healthspan mechanisms. They propose a unique approach with relatively little competition on the MoA and a straightforward road to NCE IP. There is strong published and supporting evidence for the target in mice. The mechanism for cancer prevention seems to be well established via CD44. There is already a screen hit with a potential asset in hand. This could be a first DeSci project, where the DAO is spinning out the company and that is a step forward for the community.\n\nHowever, the hyaluronan role in cancer is somewhat controversial: on one hand, HMW-HA production is linked to cancer resistance, on the other hand, HMW-HA is involved in driving and maintaining malignant progression. The underlying hypothesis needs more PoC data to be further substantiated. It is unclear if the proposed intervention would work systemically to increase life/health span and reduce cancer in humans. No detailed plans are presented. The project is early and very high risk, but no insurmountable weaknesses.\n\n\n### Quantitative Evaluation\nThe reviewers have scored the proposal on different aspects including general conviction, on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being the highest). Here are the average scores:\n- Novelty: 4.3\n- Feasibility & Data: 3.5\n- Relevance: 4.6\n- Science Team: 4.6\n- Market Advantage: 3.5\n- IP Potential: 3.7\n- Conviction score: 4.3\n\n## References\n1.

      "content": "## One liner\nAn early-stage therapeutic biotech with two programs each centered on targets that are well validated both for longevity and aging-related diseases.\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG Team\n* **Reviewers**: 2 scientists, two biotech venture capitalists and 2 business experts\n* **Shepherd**: Ryan Spangler\n* **Other squad members**: Rhys Anderson, Paolo Binetti, Maria Marinova, Mantas Matjusaitis\n* **Sourced by**: Ryan Spangler\n\n## Project lead\nScott Gies (CEO) and Douglas Vaughan MD (CSO)\n\n## Simple Summary\nZoe Biosciences is an early-stage pre-clinical biotech developing breakthrough therapeutics for age-related diseases and aging itself focusing on drug targets that are well validated both for longevity and aging-related diseases, high-leverage (pleiotropic), and low-hanging. They currently have a pipeline with two assets, both with the potential to extend human healthspan. The first program is PAI-1 biologic inhibitors with high target selectivity and affinity, relevant for diseases including elevated FGF23 syndromes and metabolic disorders. The second program is APJ small-molecule agonists for similar age-related indications. The two assets can also be advanced in combination.\n\n## Opportunity\n#### PAI-1\nThe PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) program is built upon human, genetic evidence in a Swiss Amish population in Indiana. Dr. Vaughan, Zoe’s CSO, has worked with this community since 2015 when he discovered members with a rare, loss-of-function mutation for the gene that codes for PAI-1, the main inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system. Carriers of this mutation exhibit delayed biological aging and a lower prevalence of chronic disease, informing Zoe on the effects of lifelong PAI-1 inhibition (see below).\n![Immagine1.png](ipfs://bafkreihcgi5lhqzzpsthgkzbhggtb24ub3vlzko7v2rso4qglulshytwpm)\n*A lifelong reduction of PAI-1 in Amish with a heterozygous loss-of-function mutation protects against chronic disease and prolongs human lifespan*\n\nAt present, the lead indications include metabolic disorders (prediabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome), elevated FGF23 syndromes (advance chronic kidney disease, oncogenic osteomalacia, and familial hypophosphatemic rickets), and cardiovascular disorders. Additionally, Dr. Vaughan’s studies with the Swiss Amish community will refine indication and endpoint selection.\n![Immagine2.png](ipfs://bafkreih7o45ezbm7lv2723dz5rg7ttg4szehquyqboxgylokdy4d43tvs4)\n\nVarious attempts at targeting PAI-1 in the past confirm its clinical relevance. All the past failed attempts, as well as ongoing ones with low affinity, are based on small molecules. Leveraging the founders’strong understanding of PAI-1 biology and novel approaches suggested in literature, Zoe chose a biological approach for superior affinity (see figure below).\n![Immagine3.png](ipfs://bafkreifzrortcvy2hzawrhrkh2tthe3vbab63c7cmc25w6kpgmpremye4u)\n\n#### APJ\nAPJ is expressed across many cell types and organs and plays a multitude of physiological and pathological roles related to aging, notably those mentioned above. Other, specific roles include regulation of blood pressure, cardiac contractility, metabolic balance, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, inflammation, anxiety, depression, and water homeostasis. Aging decreases expression of apelin and APJ (apelin is an agonist at the APJ receptor).\n\nThe Zoe team chose APJ for two reasons: 1. there is broad evidence for its beneficial impact on aging-related pathology and 2. apelin/APJ and PAI-1 synergistically antagonize each other. Via nitric oxide, PAI-1 blocks the beneficial effects of apelin, whereas apelin reduces the deleterious effects of PAI-1 (see below). This makes it an ideal target for a PAI-1-focused platform with a host of indication options unique to it.\n![Immagine4.png](ipfs://bafkreiggi6n4yomddxgbo6uenwwgz2lvpbifp35v6qnpajnwznbhtlih4a)\nPMID: 21358420\n\n## Solution\n#### PAI-1\nOur lead antibody was raised against human PAI-1 and is reactive towards human, mouse, and rat PAI-1. It has a high affinity KD (0.2 nM) and converts active PAI-1 to substrate PAI-1, which has been confirmed in vitro and in vivo. The antibody is undergoing early preclinical/POC testing. Additionally, we will use these early tests to finalize indication selection. Zoe has PAI-1 nanobodies it is advancing as well.\n\n#### APJ\nZoe has a lead small molecule Good PK and efficacy in rodent models with no off-target or toxicological effects in preclinical models (non-GLP).\n\n![Immagine5.png](ipfs://bafkreicc5weguz5niy2vszlsxlwnvriiap52d5kvg5azhydj76rmx2m6bq)\n\n## Relevance for longevity\nOn top of genetic validation of healthspan extension (see above), PAI-1 addresses all nine of the Hallmarks of Aging (see figure below):\n![Immagine6.png](ipfs://bafkreibjfppbsgydiane4yzgma7lkf76exmex4teasj2eo2yyse4pvo7nm)\n\n## Plan and IP roadmap\nWith this funding round, Zoe plans to advance both assets to be in the position to raise series A to conduct IND-enabling work. According to the current top level development plan the IND for the PAI-1 antibody is planned for late early 2025, for the APJ agonist the IND is scheduled for late 2024 - early 2025 (see figures below).\n![Immagine7.png](ipfs://bafkreia3uei2uzgn6kj7tfc2ro5udrfq4g4xjycnoe5iivty7j4rmq5le4)\n![Immagine8.png](ipfs://bafkreid4jjlggwwdcx7q4m3rbhvrkmopkt4idnqa34ww2dfyjnduujvi5a)\n\n#### PAI-1\nWith this seed round, Zoe plans to accomplish the following: lead selection, lead optimization, and preclinical results to support indication selection and a series A. Zoe has an exclusive option on a panel of PAI-1 murine monoclonal antibodies and antibodies developed by Dr. Paul Declerck at KU Leuven in Belgium (Zoe’s scientific advisor & a long-time collaborator of Dr. Vaughan’s). \nIf Zoe chooses to advance the antibody as the lead (the most likely scenario), the plan is to humanize & optimize (e.g. for subcutaneous delivery) the antibody and then file for fresh IP. In order to do so, Zoe has an agreement with Twist Bioscience. The work will be broken up into the following phases: \n* Project Order Initiation\n* Framework Selection \n* Screening Completion\n* Project Completion\nThis round will lead to fresh NCE IP.\n\n#### APJ \nZoe has an exclusive licensing option with Sanford Burnham Prebys for Dr. Layton Smith’s APJ agonists. There is a lead compound and a backup. \nWith seed round financing, Zoe plans to run preclinical studies to finalize indication selection and formalize the license (see preclinical models above – sarcopenia/cachexia is a lead indication for the APJ program at the moment). This in vivo work will set up Zoe’s APJ program for Series A financing and IND-enabling studies.\n\n## Financing and VitaDAO funding terms\nZoe has raised pre-seed funding from two longevity venture capital, Longevitytech Fund and Healthspan Capital.5\nIn the current seed round, Zoe is seeking $750k. VitaDAO would fund 100 k€ with equity terms.\n\n## Team\n* Scott Gies, CEO and Founder: Scott is the CEO of Zoe Biosciences and a former Advisor to Sergey Young’s Longevity Vision Fund.

APJ is validated in the sense BioAge is working on the same target. Both MOAs are applicable to both age-related disease and longevity, with the potential to treat many disease indications and potentially prevent aging in general. PAI-1 and apelin synergistically antagonize each other, which would potentially offer a combined treatment approach at later stages of development. The company has a strong IP portfolio with exclusive licenses for multiple PAI-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and APJ agonists. There are competitors and previous failures targeting PAI-1 with small molecules. Zoe has promising efficacy studies in mice with a murine antibody. It remains an uncertainty if a chronic mAb treatment at an affordable price will be a viable approach. Creating a systemic PAI-1 inhibitor could bring unforeseen consequences considering PAI-1 has diverse functions on different tissues. There are many directions this project can go:need to zero in on best indication.\n\n#### Quantitative evaluation\nThe reviewers have scored the proposal on different aspects including general conviction, on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being the highest). Here are the average scores:\n* Novelty: 3.5\n* Feasibility & Data: 3.7\n* Relevance: 4\n* Science Team: 4.5\n* Market Advantage: 2.7\n* IP Potential: 3.2\n* Conviction score: 3.3\n\n## Highlights\n* PAI-1 is genetically validated in humans. Seems to be an important target. APJ is strategically validated in the sense BioAge is working on the same target.\n* Promising efficacy studies in mice with a murine antibody\n* Head scientist is very knowledgeable.\n* Mechanisms of action applicable to both longevity and age related disease, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, musculoskeletal, and hearing loss, as well as to FGF-23 syndrome, an orphan genetic disorder,and Polycystic ovary syndrome, another unmet need\n* Have good in vivo data demonstrating improved insulin sensitivity\n* Strong IP portfolio - exclusive licenses for multiple PAI-1 mAbs and APJ agonist and IP pending around therapeutic applications for PAI-1\n* PAI-1 and apelin synergistically antagonize each other. This would potentially offer a combined treatment approach at later stages of development. Or, in case one product fails, the other could still create substantial value for Zoe and investors. \n* The PAI-1 mab strategy could be better than other companies that have aimed to inhibit PAI-1 with limited success to date. \n\n## Risks\n* The biggest challenge will be finding the right first indication to go after. The company should zero in on best indication and focus its work on what is needed to raise a phase A leading to IND-enabling studies.\n* PAI-1 has been abandoned by other players. The APJ drug that BioAge has was abandoned by Amgen.\nAPJ is a niche target from what I see in the literature.\n* PAI-1 interacts with FGF21 which has struggled to-date in other efforts with CV toxicity\n* The team size appears quite small for the planned programs and timelines, although this is also motivated by the company’s choice to subcontract to CROs. \n* It remains an uncertainty if a chronic treatment strategy with (likely) large amounts of antibody needed for adequate inhibition of endogenous PAI-1 at an affordable price will in the end be a viable approach.\n* Difficult regulatory path for antibody-based drugs without immediate life-threatening danger, although PSK9 inhibitors are paving the way.\n* PAI-1 and apelin synergistically antagonize each other, a potential cannibalism of projects should be avoided e.g. by clear differentiation of indication areas.\n\n## Vote\nHere, you, the VITA token holders, are voting to agree or disagree with the Longevity-Dealflow WG’s and senior reviewers' assessment of this company.",

      "title": "VDP-81 [Funding]: Amplio Pharma ",
      "content": "**One-liner**: Amplio Pharma is a clinical-stage biotech founded by an experienced pharma team in Sweden with an innovative formulation of methotrexate. The objective: improving this cornerstone drug’s pharmacology toward better treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID), starting with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA).\n# Longevity Dealflow WG Team\nReviewers: Tim Peterson, Michael Baran, Sebastian Brunemeier, Matthew ‘Oki’ O’Connor\nShepherd: Nina Patrick\nOther squad members: Mantas Matjusaitis, Paolo Binetti\nSourced by: Nina Patrick\nProject PI: Marguerite Mensonides\n# Simple Summary\nAmplio Pharma was founded in 2020 by three seasoned pharmaceutical executives and is proposing an innovative solution to the growing global issue of immune-mediated chronic inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) that affect up to 20 million people annually and decrease lifespan by up to 10 years if left untreated (1-4).\nAmplio Pharma’s solution involves adding a pharmacokinetics (PK) enhancer (10, 11) to the anchor treatment for IMIDs, Methotrexate. Methotrexate has a solid track record and has been the gold standard for IMID treatment for decades (5-7). However, as a mono-treatment, it is not effective enough in up to 2/3 of IMID patients (1, 8-9). With the PK enhancer the cellular retention of Methotrexate and in turn the clinical effect and benefit in undertreated IMID patients are increased.\n# Problem and solution\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/064ba5262c03a7172bb9e58a39e6131a09b7ae15.jpeg)\nIMIDs cause daily debilitating pain and fatigue, destruction of joints and other tissues, loss of work productivity, resulting in both a decreased health and life span (4-5).\nMost patients with IMIDs receive methotrexate as the first choice pharmaceutical to manage their disease. In the majority of these patients (up to 65%), mono-treatment with Methotrexate is insufficient to control the disease and its devastating effects (8, 9). Some of the ones who at first do respond develop resistance to Methotrexate with continued use.\nMethotrexate can be a very effective treatment for IMIDs, however it is expelled by cells too quickly and therefore can not produce an optimal effect (13-19, 37).\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/2710a161789811d8987517f536935e201b3c33db.png)\nThe anti-inflammatory effect of Methotrexate could be dramatically improved if it was retained in the cells.\n*Solution*\nAmplio Pharma’s prospective Methotrexate Forte increases the efficacy through retention of Methotrexate with a pharmacokinetic enhancer.\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/c88f057c4903f28774b2603413f562fc8c69d2e1.png)\nMethotrexate has been used to treat RA since the late 1940s, and both the mechanism of action and the safety profile are well understood (5, 6). Methotrexate is expelled from cells by the transporters, including the ABCG2 transporter. Patients with defective ABCG2 transporters have a better response rate to Methotrexate. The safety profile seen in patients with defective ABCG2 is the same as it is in patients with normal functioning ABCG2 (15).\nAmplio Pharma’s PK enhancer is an inhibitor of ABCG2. It is the natural compound, Novobiocin, which was discovered in the mid-1950s. Several drug products of Novobiocin have previously been approved for use in human and veterinary medicine, and like Methotrexate, its pharmacology and the safety profile are well understood (20-25).\nAmplio Pharma has been granted the patent WO18/220101 (26) by the EPO - the application is pending in the US - for this drug combination (composition of matter patent), its use, formulation and ultimate product. \nUsing their own bootstrapped funds, Amplio Pharma has demonstrated in-house that their Methotrexate Forte:\n* Produces a 2-fold increase of half-life,\n* Does not cause any other effects in the dose levels needed to alter the pharmacokinetics of Methotrexate\n* Has a PK profile similar to Methotrexate when concomitantly administered (Cmax and half life of Methotrexate and Novobiocin are similar) .\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/424c38065d6938653da6f966f4f746f139ea0ed4.png)\n# Opportunity\nAmplio Pharma’s candidate drug product contains Methotrexate, the anchor 1st choice pharmaceutical, and therefore can target the complete IMID patient population (7).\nMethotrexate is expected to remain the 1st choice treatment in the coming years despite the entry of TNF-biosimilars and generic versions of the JAK inhibitors. JAK inhibitors severely increase the risk for serious cardiovascular problems (EMA Statement), and physicians have grown more cautious in prescribing them. Despite earlier predictions,  experts no longer foresee a replacement/decrease in the use of Methotrexate. (7, 28, 29).\nIt is possible to realistically estimate the market opportunity for Amplio Pharma’s Methotrexate Forte, by looking at the historical market for traditional Methotrexate (28, 29). In 2022 the value of the Methotrexate market (US and EU5) was $568 million, with 64% of that value coming from the parenteral Methotrexate market (pre-filled syringes and autoinjectors).\nTraditionally, PK enhancers, like other excipients, require a full pre-clinical and clinical development program to ensure the safety of their use (27). However, Amplio Pharma’s team recognized that through Novobiocin, they would have a PK enhancer that has been known to be safe in humans since its discovery in the mid 1950s.\nUpon seeing this opportunity Amplio Pharma moved quickly to secure a patent for the composition of a drug product that contains both the anchor drug, Methotrexate, and the specific PK enhancer, Novobiocin. The European patent was granted in 2021 and the US patent is pending.\nAmplio Pharma can leverage the extensive pharmacology, pharmacokinetic and safety studies performed on both Methotrexate and Novobiocin, qualifying for an abbreviated clinical development program, saving time and money, and at strongly reduced risks by using well-known and well-documented compounds in their drug product.\nFor these reasons, Amplio Pharma estimates their overall probability of success in passing clinical trials and bringing Methotrexate Forte to the market to range from 70% to 95%, which is >5-fold higher than the regular probability from start of Phase I to market authorization which is about 11% (30).\nNovobiocin and Methotrexate are highly water soluble, the drug combination is suitable for subcutaneous injection. This administration route is both the most effective and provides a drug product with attractive CoG margins.\nRA, and to a certain extent Psoriasis Vulgaris (Pso), are the most obvious disease areas to test Amplio Pharma’s hypothesis and quickly come to a drug product. In addition to RA, Amplio is assessing cancer, systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus as other market opportunities for Methotrexate Forte (31, 32).\n# Relation to Longevity\nImmune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID), such as RA, are age-related diseases. Onset of RA occurs between 30 and 60 years of age (33). Currently Methotrexate is the cornerstone treatment for IMIDs like RA and Pso.\nThe Center for Disease Control (CDC) directly points to “age” as the first and foremost risk cited for the development of RA. This statement is well illustrated by Safiri S. et al, 2019 (33) in the figure below:\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/27a3b3703bc7ff100875bf3d27dc310186633828.jpeg)\nA recent review from April 2022 (34) addressed the effect of aging on the host immune system and the relationship between aging and the onset of IMIDs, such as RA. Successful treatment with Methotrexate is strongly correlated with the expansion of healthy T-cells (35, 36) and an improvement in quality of life.\nIn contrast, unsuccessful treatment leads to a decrease in quality of life due to chronic pain and fatigue, destruction of joints, damage of several internal organs, with devastating physical and emotional consequences. This chronic pain stops the patients from engaging in other known longevity-enhancing activities such as strength training and cardio activities. It has also been documented that untreated IMIDs shortens lifespan in a compelling study of morbidity and mortality in nurses over 35 years (4).\n# Plan & IP Roadmap\n* Amplio Pharma is ready to start clinical evaluation of their concept/hypothesis.\n* Their patent WO2018/220101, a composition of matter patent, discloses the technology as such.\n* In the immediate future, Amplio Pharma plans to develop and submit a clinical trial application to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of the PK enhancer following subcutaneous administration of several ascending dosing strengths.\n* This data will allow Amplio Pharma to select the appropriate dose of the PK enhancer for concomitant administration with Methotrexate and measure subsequent clinical efficacy enhancement\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/d708b0ebc2e0cea5ffa23d8e6f62e845e98e5979.jpeg)\n# Team\nThe Amplio Pharma team are seasoned pharmaceutical executives with expertise in both R&D as well as in-licensing drug products. The founders have a uniting interest in sustainable development of drug products that bring about true increases in health and life span of humanity. Each member of Amplio Pharma’s founding team individually has 25+ years in the pharmaceutical industry. They have the network and connections needed to approach Pharma partners with clinical data.\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/6893dd5c7ba25c053c0474b17c5e817ead48b088.png)\n* COO, Head of Business Development, Marguerite Mensonides (PhD), co-founder, co-owner and inventor\n* CEO, Karin von Wachenfeldt (PhD), co-founder, co-owner and inventor\n* CSO, Charlott Brunmark (PhD), co-founder, co-owner and inventor\n# Funding\nThe founders of Amplio Pharma have personally funded the development of Methotrexate Forte since 2017. To continue its development and establish human proof-of-principle, Amplio Pharma seeks a total of $1,000,000.\nAsking $100,000 from VitaDAO. Amplio Pharma is open to  a deal via the “Sponsored Development Agreement” template agreement provided by Molecule.\nVitaDAO has successfully leveraged its network to accelerate Amplio Pharma to reach their fundraising goal through an introduction to Capital Cell (their BioExpert Network analysis has been added to this proposal).\nThe budget will be used to cover the cost of the creation and submission of the first clinical trial application for the proof of principle trial plus 12 month general runway for the company (PM, IP, on-going fundraising activities), and offers the necessary bridge funding until the $ 1M raise through Capital Cell is finalized later this year.\n\n# Strengths\nThe first DeSci-funded project to go into human clinical trials.\nPatented drug combination with protection until 2037\nLow-risk as the safety profile of both drug components has been well studied and known for over 50 years\nFast development at a low cost\nSubcutaneous injectable drug products have attractive margins where a premium price can be charged for the drug product due to increased response rate and improved clinical efficacy\nThe founders are seasoned pharmaceutical executives\n# Risks\nCurrently stuck in the “Valley of Death” for two reasons:\nAttracting investment to this project has been challenging for the team since the active pharmaceutical agent (APIs) in the drug combination are known, old drugs, which are less attractive to VC who traditionally back novel drugs.\nAmplio Pharma has discussed the opportunity with several in-licensing representatives within the industry, both API producing (Methotrexate) and companies with a portfolio in the IMID area. The feedback from these industry representatives was a high interest to partner after human proof of concept (Phase II) have been obtained but before running the pivotal superiority trial (Phase III)\nMethotrexate Forte would compete in the beginning for market share against the gold standard, Methotrexate. A clear demonstration of superiority of the new drug would be needed to shift prescribers from old to new drug product\nThere is no data in support of longer lifespan in model organisms or humans in correlation with methotrexate, novobiocin, nor with their targets\n# VitaDAO Senior Review Summary\nFour senior reviewers were divided (2:2) on whether to fund this project. Qualitative review below (scale 1-5, 5 being the highest):\nThe average overall rating was 2.7/5.\n* Novelty & Impact : 2.75/5\n* Feasibility & Data : 4/5 with one reviewer voting “Not enough information provided”\n* Relevance : 1.75/5\n* Science Team : 4.3/5 with one reviewer abstaining\n* Market Advantage : 2.6/5 with one reviewer abstaining\n* IP Potential : 4/5\nReviewer 1:\n* “Pros: solid team and IP strategy, very practical solution, and efficient go-to-market. Cons: potentially too boring for other investors to join in”\nReviewer 2:\n* “VitaDAO is not a pure venture fund. Returns need to flow back to the DAO to maintain operations. An early high-profile win would not only help to validate VitaDAO as a credible model, but also to attract additional investment. While this investment is not our core mission, it does serve to help grow the DAO and in my view can be a part of a balanced portfolio strategy.”\nReviewer 3:\n* “This is worth funding by a more traditional investors, but is out of scope for VitaDAO”\nReviewer 4:\n* “The team is strong.They have their patents in order and what seems like a clear path to market, but the fact they are only modestly improving a medication targeting a disease that progressively worsens as we age is not necessarily enough to be considered innovative or taking significant steps to advancing longevity research.”\n# External Reviews from the VitaDAO Network\nOn top of VitaDAO, the project was reviewed by 15 Capital Cell (see funding section above) Bioexperts with high scores. These scores are out of 10 and position Amplio as one of the best teams Capital Cell has seen in the past, with a positive 13/15 vote to invest. Capital Cell’s fundraising has a >93% success rate.\n* Team 7.7\n* Science 7.5\n* Innovation 7.2\n* Business Potential 7.3\n* Overall Grade 7.6\n",

      "title": " VDP-85 [Assessment] HDAX Therapeutics ",
      "content": "**One liner**: HDAX is a preclinical-stage drug discovery company targeting a class of proteins implicated in neuropathies and inflammation with novel small molecules having potentially superior drug properties\n\nThis proposal is based on the supporting documents provided by HDAX Therapeutics, as well as questions and answers, and senior reviews.\n\nIf this goes on-chain, the VITA token holders will ratify the WG’s assessment via a decentralized vote\n\n# Longevity Dealflow WG team\nScientific & business evaluation : Tuan Dinh, Tim Peterson, Diane Seimetz, Joppe Nieuwenhuis\n\nShepherd : Divya Cohen\n\nOther squad members : Paolo Binetti, Tim Peterson, Ryan Spangler, Nina Patrick\n\n# Simple Summary\nHDAX Therapeutics is a small molecule preclinical stage drug discovery company developing a targeted therapeutics platform for safe and efficacious treatment of Histone Deacetylase (HDAC)-driven pathologies such as neuropathies and cancers with high unmet medical need. They have started with HDAC6, whose knock-down also increased the lifespan of animal models in recent literature\n\nWith the novel compact bitopic binding mechanism it has developed, HDAX overcomes common drug discovery challenges including weak binding, off-target toxicities, and poor pharmacokinetic profiles that have hampered the drug development of previous attempts in this field. In particular, their lead HDAC6 inhibitor can cross the blood-brain-barrier, enabling Central Nervous System (CNS) disease targeting that is not possible with competing molecules, including clinical candidates.\n\nHDAX is a spinout from Prof. Patrick Gunning’s lab at University of Toronto, a leading professor in his field and serial entrepreneur (Janpix, Dunad, & Dalriada Therapeutics). Up to date they have won several startup competitions, raised $340k, and patented the chemical composition of their lead compound. HDAX is seeking funding to cover part of the clinical nomination phase of their HDAX6 compound, including lead optimization and testing in indication-specific animal models.\n\n# Problem\nHDAC6 is a validated clinical target whose inhibition can be an effective and safe strategy to treat brain/nerve pathologies such as cancers, neuropathies, and neurodegeneration. Unfortunately, to date, there are no FDA-approved HDAC6-targeting drugs and most pipeline candidates suffer from poor target engagement, inadequate brain penetration, and low tolerability. There are five HDAC6 clinical candidates for the treatment of mostly non-CNS cancers as their pharmacokinetic liabilities exclude them from targeting HDAC6-implicated brain diseases, urging for the development to address these challenges.\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/09700a5ec0a2ebdd1e6680a947626db6f84bd6e2_2_1380x714.jpeg)\n\n# Opportunity\nThe HDAX technology has the potential to be applicable in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPD), diabetic-induced peripheral neuropathy (DIPN), and Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy (CMT), as implicated in preclinical studies [1]. Similarly, all these indications lack a curative treatment and thus, presents as an opportunity to become the first-in-class, breakthrough therapy.\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/2278ba86d2d40f13bd8bb4dd7fbb2aeb3fd5e2ae_2_1380x858.jpeg)\n\nThe interest for HDAC inhibitors is confirmed by deals in past years. For example, in 2019 Rodin Therapeutics, a pre-clinical company developing a first-in-class, orally-available, brain-permeable, HDAC2 therapeutics (HDAC-CoREST complex inhibitor, RDN-929) for brain diseases driven by synaptic loss and dysfunction, was acquired by Alkermes in a deal worth $100M upfront cash plus up to $850M depending on development candidate achieving clinical and regulatory milestones and sales thresholds.\n\nBesides aging-related diseases, HDAC proteins are promising targets to improve healthspan [2] and lifespan, as recently shown specifically for HDAC6 homologs in c. elegans and drosophila [3], [4]. The data below, taken from [3], showcases lifespan extension and rescue of climbing score (a measure of locomotive function) after genetic inhibition of HDAX6 (via RNAi) in drosophila.\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/5929d9ed9cf505efdd7d4af717a3035165457346.png)\n\n# Solution\nHDAX Tx’s lead compound avoids the fallacies of past HDAX6 inhibitors though the rational design of a patented, dual coordinated mechanism of action which has resulted in superior selectivity and potency. This was achieved via a novel dual-coordination of thecatalytic Zn2+ metal at the HDAX6 enzyme active site by directly engaging the hydroxamate moiety in the first-shell coordination sphere, and an indirect second-shell coordination via the metal-bound histidine ligand.\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/37a05ae62af0b3fd1a87b8b67e7197bbb884175d_2_1380x758.jpeg)\n\nThis multi-coordination ligand increases HDAC6 affinity and selectivity and affords a unique chemotype that has generated HDAXTx’s most potent and selective analogs. Through their rational, iterative structure activity relationship (SAR) studies, HDAX has also improved the pharmacokinetics of their lead compounds to achieve impressive in vivo bioavailability with plasma concentrations >5,000 ng/mL and brain concentration >3,000 ng/mL following 20 mg/kg IP dosing in mice studies via treatment of new generation of compounds.\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/c5b4e49147c87f35381d171a3e6df6c21b63c5e5_2_1380x808.jpeg)\n\nFurthermore, HDAXTx has demonstrated preliminary safety through in vivo tolerability, Ames test, and hERG binding studies to reveal the potential for use in chronic diseases. These molecules are being advanced to in vivo studies in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease mice models, and the company anticipates more subsequent in vivo studies in preparation for clinical validation of this novel class of inhibitors.\n\n# Intellectual Property\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/87b7c9ea078c06cdf8d4c5070645f4fa6141bfd2_2_1380x792.jpeg)\n\nTeam\nDr. Nabanita Nawar, PhD – CEO & cofounder, nabanita@hdaxtx.com\n\nDr. Pimyupa Manaswiyoungkul, PhD – COO & cofounder, pimyupa@hdaxtx.com\n\nProf Patrick Gunning, PhD - Scientific Advisor & cofounder, patrick.gunning@utoronto.ca\n\nDr. Olasunkanmi Olaoye, PhD - VP Drug Discovery & cofounder, tobi.olaoye@mail.utoronto.ca\n\nDr. Elvin de Araujo, PhD – CINO & cofounder, e.dearaujo@mail.utoronto.ca\n\nDr. Roman Fleck - Executive chairman, romanfleck@gmail.com\n\nThe founders have known each other for 4-10 years and all of them have initially met at the University of Toronto. Patrick Gunning is a Professor of Chemistry at the University of Toronto. CEO Nabanita Nawar and VP Drug Discovery Tobi Olaoye and COO Dr. Pimyupa Manaswiyoungkul graduated from Prof Patrick Gunning’s lab with PhD’s in medicinal chemistry. CINO Dr. Elvin De Araujo is the research manager and former post-doc at the Gunning Group. All members have collaborated in multiple academic projects and scientific innovations under the supervision of Patrick Gunning, which has resulted in over a dozen high-impact peer-reviewed publications and patents.\n\n# Research Plan\nHDAXTx aims to use the funding to conduct IND-enabling animal trials in indication-specific animal models. Upon gaining additional insights into the pharmacodynamics of our molecules in animals, we will be utilizing the funding to accelerate lead optimization for clinical candidate nomination by the end of 2022.\n\nThe 12 month milestones for this project is focused on clinical candidate selection. Although the current lead molecules already display commendable drug-like properties, further refinement to improve brain exposure will most likely enhance the efficacy and allow the molecules to achieve a broader dosing regimen. To accomplish these priorities, the project has 2 main goals:\n\nGoal 1: Lead optimization towards clinical candidate selection. Evaluate top molecules for efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic profile. ($50,000)\n\nGoal 2: Evaluate compound tolerability and efficacy in indication-specific animal models. ($200,000)\n\nSuccess of goal 1 may result in additional IP generation pending the improvements which has led to meaningful results. This clause has been captured under our favorable option for exclusive licensing from the University of Toronto, whom will be supporting the pursuant of the development of any novel findings originating from goal. Similarly, success of goal 1 may lead to the opportunity to employ an additional PDF in cellular/animal biology to accelerate the completion of goal 2, contributing to the growing life science sector in Ontario.\n\n# Financing\nTo date HDAXTx has won 10 programs at 9 different pitch competitions, securing over a combined amount of $340,000 in non-dilutive funding.\n\nIn this round HDAXTx is raising $2M in notes with various investors to fund clinical candidate validation (see above), R&D expansion, and business development.\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/0252f4140f3511949ae83d515378b73ed761be15_2_1248x710.jpeg)\n\nBibliography\n* [1] “HDAC6: A Key Link Between Mitochondria and Development of Peripheral Neuropathy”, 2021\n* [2] “From molecular promise to preclinical results: HDAC inhibitors in the race for healthy aging drugs”, 2019\n* [3] “Inactivating histone deacetylase HDA promotes longevity by mobilizing trehalose metabolism”, 2021\n* [4] “Immunosuppression Induced by Brain‑Specific HDAC6 Knockdown Improves Aging Performance in Drosophila melanogaster”, 2022\n\n#Additional information\n\n[Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrpYxUXWZN7nfz0S/tblRRhOxDlYNoXG7P/viwmZ4IO52AZf43VW/recaX4AgTcxj4okzi)\n\n\nPitch Deck\n[HDAX.pdf](https://airtable.com/shrpYxUXWZN7nfz0S/tblRRhOxDlYNoXG7P/viwmZ4IO52AZf43VW/recaX4AgTcxj4okzi)\n\nNDA Restricted Information Available Under NDA [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1quV9sq3cxilDVxot9lw4g5xgH7-xqPUie8LT_fGxixo/edit)\n\n(*Please note access will only be granted once this NDA template is signed and added to this folder.

So far mouse studies have only been completed in cancer models (previous indication explored by HDAX) rather than peripheral neuropathy.\n* Being based in Canada makes fundraising for further clinical trials harder.\n\n# Longevity WG scientific evaluation digest\n**Qualitative evaluation**\nHDAX has good initial in vitro and in vivo data, with good safety, strong sensitivity, good PK profile, strong HDAC6 binding. Strong literature supporting the connection between HDAC6 and age-related diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration: targeting HDAC is popular and a strong fit with VitaDAO. Most HDAC trials/drugs are related to oncology. Inhibition of HDAC6 can restore normal nerve function in peripheral neuropathies. The HDAX team has relevant background in research and drug development, the founders have known each other and worked together for a long time. The company was spun out from the lab of Prof. Patrick Gunning, a serial entrepreneur, secured dilutive funding and got some exposures at pitch competitions. Some IP is already established.\n\nHowever, HDACs have a long history of failure in biopharma. Several HDAC-inhibiting drugs with selectivity for HDAC6 are already in clinical development, one recently completed their Series B financing round, another has brain-penetrant, small molecule, selective HDAC6 inhibitors. While HDAX’s limited available data support the differentiation with competitors to a certain extent, the medical relevance is unclear at this stage.\n\nIn summary, this is an early-stage, high-risk opportunity in a promising space with significant competition.\n\n**Quantitative evaluation**\nThe reviewers have scored the proposal on different aspects including general conviction, on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being the highest). Here are the average scores:\n\n* Novelty: 2.5\n* Feasibility & Data: 3\n* Relevance: 4\n* Science Team: 4\n* Market Advantage: 3\n* IP Potential: 4\n* Conviction score: 2.75\n",

      "title": " VDP-74 [Assessment]: Etheros Pharma - Jack Scannell ",
      "content": "**One-liner**: Etheros Pharma is a preclinical biotech, pioneering a new small-molecule drug class that extends mammalian lifespan and neural healthspan (based on catalytic fullerenes)\n\n# Longevity Dealflow WG team\n**Scientific and business evaluation**: Alexandra Stolzing, Sebastian Brunemeier, Matthew \"Oki\" O'Connor, David Wilson\n**Shepherd**: Paolo Binetti\n**Other squad members**: Laurence Ion, Tyler Golato\n**Applicant (project lead)**: Dr. Jack Scannell\n\n# Simple Summary\nEtheros is pioneering a new class of small molecule drugs, based on Nobel Prize-winning fullerene chemistry. The lead compound extends mouse lifespan, improves cognition in elderly mice, and has proven neuroprotective in a wide range of double-blind, placebo-controlled animal studies, ranging from a Parkinson’s Disease model in primates, via a familial ALS model in mice, to an asphyxia-induced brain injury model in pigs. The compounds’ novel catalytic activity makes them extremely potent, in head to head neuroprotection studies, versus conventional antioxidants that have previously struggled in human neuroprotection trials.\nThe current raise, several hundred thousand dollars, will help Etheros improve its IP portfolio. It will also allow us to plan and cost, in executable detail, the optimal route to proof of mechanism in humans. Fresh IP and a firm plan to the clinic will help Etheros raise more capital on good terms in 8 to 10 months’ time.\n\n# Problem\nOxygen-based metabolism is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides more energy than the wide variety of other metabolic chemistries. Hence all multicellular organisms respire with oxygen. On the other hand, oxygen’s high-energy chemistry destroys biological molecules. Consequently, all living things have a wide range of mechanisms to protect against oxidative damage, including the superoxide dismutase (and catalase) enzymes that our drugs mimic.\nNeural tissue is particularly sensitive to oxidative injury. This follows from neurons’ high metabolic rate, high lipid content, complex three dimensional structure, and from the fact that neurons do not regenerate. A wide range of injuries can activate a common set of oxidative pathways, which increase the concentration of superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and other reactive oxygen species, which in turn compound inflammation and injury.\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/b8fd0c161a3a6690d14910d135df5ab4c37197f1.png)\n\n# Opportunity\nOur compounds mimic enzymes, superoxide dismutases and, to a lesser extent, catalases, that protect cells from oxidative and inflammatory injury. The lead compound has good brain penetrance, high oral bioavailability, and considerable safety data from long-term exposure in mice and primates. \nThe technology can play in a wide range of therapeutic settings, some with huge commercial potential. One founder, Marc Feldmann, was responsible for the discovery of the anti-TNFs, which became the World’s highest selling drug class. He partnered with Dugan to commercialize her technology because he recognized a similar opportunity. Chas Bountra, an SAB member, was Head of Biology at GlaxoSmithKline and has experience of prior work in this general field. He understands the benefits of our novel catalytic mechanism versus conventional untargeted antioxidants. To quote Bountra: “Let’s be clear on why we don’t have effective treatments for [these kinds of neural] injuries. It’s not because we got the biology wrong. It is because, despite years of trying, neither big pharma nor biotech found drugs that had enough potency at the site of injury. We never found the right kind of chemistry. Etheros, at long last, seems to have solved the chemistry problem.”\n\nWe have a lead compound, C3, for which we already generated efficacy data in a wide range of animal models with mechanistic relevance to both rare and common human diseases. We see a tractable path to use in large markets; starting in niche indications that are mechanistically attractive, and where we can prove the therapeutic concept, before raising the large sums of capital necessary to fund trials in common diseases.\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/4c6622781fe1258d5d12bd45667280a7795d8325.png)\n\n![](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/original/1X/68ddc8d2b5eff3af5ff3fe11d6d69d130926f62a.png)\n\n# Intellectual Property\nThe bulk of the current raise will be invested to secure patent protection for new compounds, so we do not want to disclose details at this stage. Note that the Etheros has engaged experienced IP counsel and that the team has deep experience in IP creation. We are confident that we will secure robust IP. We are also confident that we have freedom to operate, unconstrained by competitors’ IP.\n\n# Relevance to Longevity\nWe have relevant data from several placebo-controlled double-blind animal studies. For a non-exhaustive list:\nOur lead compound increased lifespan in wild-type mice. Treatment started at 12 months of age. There was an 11% increase in median lifespan (mortality HR 0.59, p<0.004). In the same experiment, treated mice had better cognitive performance when aged between 23 and 26 months (measured via Morris water maze). Treatment also prevented the typical age-related decline in brain mitochondrial function and reduced measures of brain oxidative stress.\nThe aged brain typically shows evidence of impaired proteostasis. Aggregates of the protein p62 are markers of impaired proteostasis and are also implicated in neuronal injury. C3, administered to mice from 12 to 17 months of age, reduced p62 aggregation in the brain.\n\nOur lead compound is protective in a primate model of Parkinson’s, itself a common age-related neurodegenerative disease. C3 was initiated 7 days after unilateral MPTP-induced brain injury. After 2 months, treated monkeys had significantly better parkinsonian motor ratings and higher striatal dopamine levels. None of the treated animals developed any toxicity.\nIn two studies, our lead compound was effective in a mouse model of familial ALS, another age-related neurodegenerative pathology.\n\n# Financing\nEtheros is raising its first round of pre-seed / seed capital; several hundred thousand dollars. The main uses of cash will be:\nGeneral corporate expenses.\nSpecialist consulting advice on IP, medicinal chemistry, formulation, regulation, and IND-enabling toxicology and CMC.\nSynthesis of a stock of non-GMP C3, our lead compound.\nSynthesis and testing of novel chemistries to secure new IP. \n\n# Team\n**Founders**\n**Professor Laura Dugan**: Dugan is the Abram C.

The scientific team is outstanding, they have well known scientists and very successful management. The company is backed by venture-capital. However, many untargeted antioxidants have failed in the past. The company has no current patent. And because no fullerene-based compounds have ever been brought into the clinic high burden is expected to get proof of safety/pharmacology of fullerenes. In summary this is a high potential /high risk opportunity, well aligned with VitaDAO’s objectives.\n**Quantitative**: The average conviction score was 3.9/5.\n\n\n# Highlights\n* A novel catalytic mechanism and high potency in neuroprotection assays where conventional antioxidants, tested concurrently, are largely ineffective.\nIn vivo efficacy data from a diverse range of neural injury and neurodegeneration models, all conducted as double blind placebo-controlled studies.\n* A new mechanism for lifespan and neural healthspan extension in a well-powered mouse longevity model.\n* Prima-facie evidence of safety from mouse longevity study and from chronic dosing in primates. Safety analyses so far include post-mortem histology of major organ systems, standard clinical bloods, ECG, etc. \n* Good pharmacokinetics, with high level of brain penetrance, oral bioavailability, and clearance via urine and bile with minimal metabolism.\n\n\n# Risks\n* Failure of novel chemistry. We believe that we can commercialize our lead compound, C3, in niche indications despite the lack of composition of matter patent protection. Method of use patents, orphan exclusivity, and other barriers to competition should be sufficient. However, to raise the capital necessary to exploit larger and more lucrative markets, we likely require new patentable chemistry. It is possible that the new chemistries that we plan to explore will work much less well than we hope.\n* The choice of first-in-man indications. There is much we can do to mitigate risk in indication selection (e.g., knowledge of pathological mechanism, the predictive validity of screening and disease models, diversification across a range of disease mechanisms, a mixture of acute and chronic indications, etc.) but we cannot eliminate it.\n* CMC (chemistry, manufacturing, and controls) requirements for an entirely new drug class. However Etheros has done some scoping work with a specialist manufacturer that has already produced small batches of the API at high purity, and believes that CMC hurdles can be met. \n",

      "title": "VDP-86 [Assessment] Humanity - digital health app ",
      "content": "**One liner:** Humanity is an app that uses wearable technology and quantified-self methods to enable anyone with a smartphone to measure their rate of aging and it uses AI to find out what lifestyle actions and more advanced interventions each type of user should take to slow it down: ”a Waze for longevity”.\n\n**Longevity Dealflow WG Team**\nShepherd: Eli Mohamad\nOther squad members: Laurence Ion, Paolo Binetti, Tuan Dinh, Alex Dobrin, Tim Peterson\n\n**Simple Summary**\n[Humanity](https://www.humanity.health/) is a quantified-self app that enables users to connect physical wearables and activity apps that monitor digital biomarkers through a single interface. Users may manually add data as well and soon will be able to upload blood and genetic data. The data from all these sources is used to generate a proprietary score representing the rate of the user’s aging. Importantly, the app then helps users understand which activities and habits slow down or even reverse their current rate of aging. The company uses multiple established behavior modification tools to steer user behavior, and develops its own tools and biomarkers, with the goal of sourcing, distributing and guiding users to take better healthspan interventions over time.\n\n**VitaDAO collaboration potential beyond financing**\nHumanity uses “points” to reward users for actions. The Humanity team is very open to discussing what role $Vita may be able to play as a “longevity token” in or adjacent to the app. Such exploration would be in line with the VitaDAO Strategic Plan of 2023. For example, even just expanding our token users by 150k people (the current Humanity userbase) may be a great benefit to VitaDAO.\n\n**Problem and Opportunity**\nThe development of drug or biologics-based therapies addressing chronic and other aging-related diseases is an extremely expensive and time-intensive endeavor. We are yet to see a drug or therapy that significantly extends the human healthspan. On the other hand, behavioral modifications such as diet, physical activity, sleep, and stress, have been shown to have an incredible impact on human healthspan. Exercise alone (in the form of weightlifting and aerobic activity), has been [associated](https://examine.com/summaries/study/9kN7G0/) with a >40% decrease in all-cause mortality risk.\n\n![|563x301](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/c8cefec2603953fdd9f0a7267faf97c8efe0346a_2_1126x602.jpeg)\n\nInstead of attacking chronic diseases one by one, Humanity is pursuing development and implementation of behavioral interventions that slow aging, potentially adding many more healthy years than any single drug or therapy that would cure any of the top chronic disease killers today.\n\n![|624x367](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/f857f22af6b109ffaf8f79e4f674bee65f8f34ad_2_1248x734.jpeg)\n\nThe rate-of-aging scores are calculated by proprietary algorithms built on longitudinal data (External Biobank Database). The algorithms are improved by continuously combining data from existing users (Humanity Biobank Database), enabling the discovery of better metrics and better combinations of digital and physical biomarkers to eventually being able to increase the positive impact of interventions and behavioral modification. Behaviors are gamified based on points (in-game currency) as well as digital twins (i.e. what worked for “similar” users best), increasing user retention and activity.\n\n![|565x327](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/e89f451707787ed5972b9b9ae61057a4c73a05ac_2_1130x654.jpeg)\n\nCurrent traction reflects the perception of app utility by the (still) early users. With a 10% conversion to premium users, as well as 65% 12-week retention of premium users, the app’s metrics are significantly above industry numbers.\n\nHigh retention may also be explained by the apparent success of Humanity’s behavioral modification tools. A clinically obese cohort (i.e. those that can gain most from behavioral modification) experienced an 18% (15.4% median for all active users) sustained increase in movement after signing up, over the lifespan of the observational study (80 days - 40 days before and 40 days after sign up to Humanity).\n\n**Intellectual property**\nHumanity endeavors to improve a “digital first” aging model they developed based on UK Biobank data and a partnership with Gero, which uses movement and heart rate patterns along with other attributes of the user to measure aging daily.\n\nPossibly the most unique IP is the creation of a database of what actions and interventions are working in combination to reduce different types of people’s rates of aging. The combination of actions/interventions and what type of person each combination works for is information no other project currently has a reasonable ability to collect at scale. Humanity has the potential to reach hundreds of millions of users directly.\n\n![|577x325](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/d4192628656fa568b3f3e6dbc9fe1a1f4422d129_2_1154x650.jpeg)\n\nFuture upgrades:\nWhile the company’s focus remains on digital biomarkers, it aims to add genetic and blood monitoring services and already has those relationships set up with Illumina and Eurofins. The data gathered from these products (e.g. genotyping and DNA methylation), and combined with digital biomarkers, may yield yet additional IP.\n\n![|587x342](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/b6691577eed18ddfbb1807c3700a5dd83c397abf_2_1174x684.png)\n\n**Team**\nThe Humanity founding team are seasoned serial entrepreneurs who previously launched extremely successful digital consumer platforms and exited their companies. They are also reportedly long time supporters of the Longevity sector.\n\n**Peter Ward**, CEO and co-founder\nAfter starting his career in management consulting, Peter co-founded, built and ran the world’s largest social travel network for over 13 years: WAYN.com. After selling the company to lastminute.com group in 2016, Peter successfully launched and rolled out ContentHUB - a state-of-the-art site personalization CMS. He then grew WAYN revenues by 194%, and increased monthly visits by 55% in just 12 months post-acquisition.\n\n**Michael Geer**, CSO (Chief Strategy Officer) and co-founder\nBefore co-founding Humanity, Michael was CSO/COO of AnchorFree, running one of the world’s most popular freedom and privacy digital platforms. Anchorfree apps grew by over 100M downloads in just 12 months, and approximately 400,000 people download an AnchorFree App every day. Michael helped the platform grow to 900M users. Previously, Michael was on the founding team of Badoo, and grew it into one of the largest dating sites worldwide. Badoo was sold for $3 bn.\n\n![|624x356](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/4e0e659d8f141f4b0c787dfdd26790f80718eb32_2_1248x712.jpeg)\n\nThe company has an advisory board of some of the world’s top scientists and thinkers, including Kristen Fortney (CEO of Bioage), George Church (HMS), Robert Green (HMS), Tonu Esko (Direct at Estonian Biobank) and Peter Joshi (CSO at Humanity Inc).\n\n![|624x351](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/standard20/uploads/vitadao/optimized/1X/f838f5b94f3a043e00e62c9f7c0b4910486e82d7_2_1248x702.png)\n\n**Financing**\nHumanity has previously raised $5M, and the team is currently raising $1M in a standard SAFE, of which $950k has been committed. VitaDAO could contribute the last $50,000 to close this round. The team anticipates starting to raise a ~5M Seed Round later in 2023.\n\nThe use of capital would be for development salaries, marketing, and operations.\n\n**Strengths**\n* Excellent team, with ample experience in growing the userbase for digital platforms\n* Grew to >150k users in 12 months\n* Appstore 4.8 rating with 2.5k ratings\n* Potential for making digital biomarkers as significant in chronic disease prediction as blood biomarkers, enabling earlier and more substantial interventions to extend healthspan\n* Captive audience for experimental interventions and tests\n* Freemium subscription has been shown to work in the quantified-self field\n\n**Risks**\n\n* Highly competitive landscape - further exploration on strength of IP is needed\n* The team is yet to prove the ability to extend healthspan through more complex interventions in addition to increasing physical activity or extending fasting windows\n* Experimental plans yet to be developed\n\n# Evaluation\nThis proposal has been evaluated by 3 business experts and scientists, obtaining an average conviction score of 4/5. The reviewers agreed the biggest strength of the proposal is the team and the fact the company is open to experiment with $VITA. While engagement has seen a drop in the beginning of this year, it followed a large drop in marketing expenses. This is expected to reverse starting March. \n\n",

      "title": "VDP-82 [Assessment]: Siphox Health: at-home blood-based diagnostics",
      "content": "**TLDR**: Siphox 5’s tagline captures it: “Better health by measuring more”.\n\n**Problem**: Our understanding of blood biomarkers and their relevance to disease has greatly increased over the last decade. Detailed tracking of these biomarkers is instrumental to longevity, but cumbersome with current technology which is limited to infrequent blood draws at a lab or unreliable at-home tests.\n\nInnovation at the hardware level is required to equip consumers with usable biomarker data to tighten the feedback loop for therapy.\n\n**Solution**: SiPhox miniaturizes the phlebotomy lab to bring accessible, frequent, and cheap blood testing for key biomarkers into consumers’ homes, paving the way for tightly integrated personalised therapies with measurable effects on healthspan.\n\n**Problem Details**:\n\n42% of US adults are obese; 33% have metabolic syndrome.\n30% of Americans use a wearable health device, yet lack actionable, frequent biomarker data (with the exception of glucose monitoring via CGMs)\nEvaluating hormones, inflammation, metabolic health requires costly & slow clinical visits and vials of blood.\nInfrequent draws means biomarkers cannot be deeply understood or used to evaluate lifestyle changes.\nAt-home dried blood testing (via mail) is possible but requires significant quantities of blood; tests are unreliable\nMiniaturizing hardware for frequent, convenient, cheap, low-volume at home testing is necessary\n\n**Solution details**:\nCurrent offering: Mail in blood. 17 blood biomarkers to measure inflammation, hormones, and metabolic + cardiovascular health. Cortisol, DHEA-S, Testosterone, Folate, hsCRP, HCY, Ferritin, Vitamin D, HBA1C, Insulin, Triglyceride, HDL ratio LDL Cholesterol HDL, Cholesterol, APOA1, APOB. Measurement via fingerprick (8 drops). Results in 3-5 days. Starting at $95/test. Additional pricing details are available on their website.\n\nComing soon (protoyping and testing): At home reader where users receive results within minutes. Reusable reader with inexpensive ($5) disposable cartridges. ~5 microleters of blood required (typical drop of blood is ~35 microliters) Arm blood collection - no blood handling necessary. Engineering units 3rd party validated in a study via Boston heart Diagnostics and Wyss Institute researcher.\n\n**Longer term (roadmap)**: Wearable subdermal continuous protein monitor. Would make 5-10 biomarker measurements every 15 minutes, with a 14-day sensor (similar to CGMs).\n\n28 biomarkers in pipeline. Indicative first product: hsCRP inflammation test. CRP is an inflammation marker that predicts heart attack, stroke, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, sudden cardiac death. Siphox has completed an external hsCRP validation study in line with FDA reqs, beta testing in Q12023, FDA submission 2024\n\nCurrently the product offering is designed for monthly testing, but the vision is for daily testing and eventually real time protein monitoring via a subdermal implant.\n\n**Relevance to longevity**\n\n- Siphox is doing fundamental R&D to reduce the cost of blood assays, through silicon photonics. This contrasts with popular testing companies like Everlywell etc that use commodity, off the shelf hardware and are primarily marketing-based.\n\n- Siphox increases the frequency and reduces the cost and frictions involved in obtaining vital biomarker data. Frequent data enables the following:\n-- Quantitatively assessing impact of pharmacological longevity interventions\n-- Evaluating physiological response to dietary, lifestyle, and fitness interventions with high fidelity (Siphox’s beta platform already allows for correlating data against other wearables)\n- Siphox allows users to detect biomarker abnormalities proactively, rather than reactively after symptoms emerge (and a Dr’s visit), leading to better health outcomes\n-- For instance, one Siphox user had high Ferritin levels investigated, and found they had hereditary hemochromatosis - enabling them to treat it early before symptoms developed\n-- Biomarkers are often out of range long before a chronic disease becomes symptomatic. Frequent biomarker analysis allows for early detection and lifestyle or clinical intervention.\n- More frequent testing enables better measurement for essential biomarkers that exhibit seasonality. Routine testing allows users to eliminate this source of noise and have more confidence in their biomarker data\n-- For instance, cholesterol fluctuates on a seasonal basis and due to changes in metabolism, as well as physical activity.\n**Go to market**:\n\n*B2C*: Currently how the product is distributed. Membership model so users only pay for kits they use.\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Synergistic with most longevity therapeutics companies because they need to track biomarkers to see changes. Also, Siphox has a captive audience of test takers that are more likely to be open to joining experiments/trials.\n- Ready-to-go opportunity enabling VitaDAO to demonstrate success earlier than more early-stage projects.\n- Proven chips team with success in miniaturization in various domains, and prior multi-$B exits\n- Protective patent portfolio. 22 patents and provisional patents pending in areas ranging from silicon photonics to bioassays to software and wearables.\n- Integrations with popular wearables: Apple, AccuCheck, Oura, etc to make correlations with Siphox data and evaluate impact of lifestyle, diet, fitness on biomarkers\n- Enterprise plan to complement consumer plan. Enterprise plan allows using Siphox infrastructure (tests and shipping logistics) while allowing one to showcase their own brand.\n- If they can get FDA approval for at-home blood assay for any of their biomarkers, revenue opportunities are colossal. The only other FDA-approved embedded blood testing device is the continuous glucose monitor - and that’s a $6b/year market.\n- Competitive positioning\n -- Vs mail-in testing companies by having own equipment\n -- Vs biomarker analytics firms because those require clinical phlebotomy visits\n -- Vs standard clinical visits because those are infrequent and generally require insurance and cumbersome scheduling, hospital visits\n- VitaDAO could potentially leverage Siphox’s growing customer base to incentivize $VITA token adoption by incorporating it in Siphox’s customer acquisition/sales.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- Series A is later than VitaDAO typically evaluates projects.\n- Unclear cost-to-benefit ratio for younger/healthy people who don’t need to check their blood more frequently.\n- Digital phenotypes like HRV and images being pioneered by other companies are potentially more scalable and more predictive than the molecular solutions Siphox is offering.\n\n**Company**: Founded in Boston 2020, raised $10m to date (primarily went into chip R&D)\n\n**Team**: World class chip & healthtech team with multiple exits. Team boasts a strong track record of miniaturization.\n\nDiedrik Vermeulen PHD, CEO/Cofounder\n\n• Pioneer in silicon photonics (Acacia Comms, acq.)\n\n• Research scientist at MIT, 20 patents, >100 papers\n\nMichael Dubrovsky, CPO/Cofounder\n\n• Materials chemist known for silicon photonics (21 patents)\n\n• Cofounder and Director of R&D at Simply Grid (acquired)\n\nGavin Chen PHD, Lead Process Scientist\n\n• Led surface chemistry at QuantumSI (protein sequencing) for 7 years\n\nAlex Vinitsky PHD, Lead Assay Development\n\n• 20 years experience in protein biochemistry & assay development\n\n• Founded Affina Biotechnologies & ARVYS Proteins\n\nKyle Preston PHD, Photonics Design Lead\n\n• 16 yrs experience in silicon photonics for medical applications\n\n• Led systems integration at QuantumSI\n\nSarat Gunduvarapu PHD, Lead Photonics and Electronics\n\nPavel Korecky MD, Lead of Product Operations\n\nLauren Weiniger MBA, CMO\n\nPrior exit in healthtech (Safely)\n\nThree years of R&D into photonic chips.\n\nDevelopment: 6 PHDs on core team, one MD, 20 full time staff.\n\nTeam prior exits:\n\n• Acacia Comms, $4.5b IPO\n\n• QuantumSI, $1.5b IPO\n\n• SimplyGrid, acq. MOVE\n\n• Caliopa, acq. Huawei\n\n• Safely App, acq. Mayo Clinic\n\nFundraising details\n\nThe Series A is being led by Khosla Ventures & (redacted). Additional investors include YCombinator, Balaji Srinivasan, Paul Buchheit, Jared Friedman, Metaplanet, R2, Ilya Volodarsky, Calvin French.\n\nOpportunity: Well-known crypto investor, Nic Carter 3, is offering equity allocations in his SPV, Starling SPV.\n\n**Poll result**: 16 out of 24 (67%) agreed that Siphox was a good opportunity. 7/24 (29%) disagreed and 1/24 (4%) requested more information.\n\nPotential Siphox-VitaDAO partnership\n\nWe’d also like to determine the interest in partnering with Siphox to increase the utility of the $VITA token while getting people healthier by using Siphox’s testing. Should VitaDAO pursue a partnership with Siphox?\n\n**Poll result**: 17 out of 24 (71%) agreed that partnering with Siphox would be a good opportunity. 5/24 (21%) disagreed and 2/24 (8%) requested more information.\n\n**Shephard**: Tim Peterson\n\nSenior reviewers: neuroscientist/investor, data scientist/investor, diagnostic company CEO, drug discovery PhD scientist. Average senior review scoring was 3.5 from four reviews.\n\n**Senior reviewer highlights**:\n\n**Pros**:\n\n- Experienced team with multiple exits\n\n- Test comprehensive biomarker panels across a range of indications\n\n- More testing means detecting disease earlier in asymptomatic customers\n\n- Provided a manuscript with data to back up their claims and describe their pipeline in detail.\n\n**Cons**:\n\n- Lab-on-chip is a crowded market with ~100 startups that have similar pitches. The key question would be what make Siphox stand out against other startups. There is very little talking about competitors in Siphox’s materials.\n\n- High valuation - upside maybe limited\n\n- Blood biomarker variability will naturally be increased by small sample size and interstitial fluid\n\n- Only showed data for a single analytical validation experiment (despite bragging over 15+ biomarket tests)",

      "content": "***One-liner**: BE Corp is a spinout company out of Jean Hebert’s lab at Einstein College of Medicine, working on brain tissue replacement.*\n\n**Shepherds/Squad:**  Tuan Dinh, Maria Marinova, Tim Peterson, Tyler Golato\n**Scientific & IP Evaluation:** Sebastian Brunemeier, Tim Peterson, Nina Patrick, Diane Seimetz, David Wilson\n\n**Sourced by:** Laurence Ion\n\n**Project PI:** Jean Hebert\n\n**Simple Summary**\nApollo Health Ventures has finished negotiations to spin out Jean Hebert's work on engineering replacement brain tissue. \n\nThey will provide $1.5M and are offering the VitaDAO community the opportunity to participate in the formation and operation of BE Therapeutics Inc, with an allocation of $100,000. \n\nJean Hebert is a leading expert on the subject of brain aging and he is creating methods for brain tissue replacement for use in stroke with his laboratory at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\n\n>  **Comparison with the initial VDP-10, dated Oct 4, 2021** \n> \n> The prior iteration of VDP-10 (10/4/21) advised VitaDAO to “either A) own a small piece of Jean’s work via an IP-NFT and a sponsored research agreement, B) participate alongside Apollo Health Ventures in the company that is being created around Jean’s work or C) some combination of both”. Since then, we have made significant progress with Option #B, including:\n> 1. A company (BE Therapeutics Inc) was formed, with a CEO (Davide Zanchi, PhD) and a clear commercialization plan\n> 2. Apollo and Einstein College agreed on deal terms\n> 3. A full-fledged research plan with achievable milestones/timeline is in place\nThe current VDP-10 ready for snapshot voting reflects those changes. \n\n**Problem** A big challenge facing tissue and organ replacement as a strategy to defeat aging relates to the brain. The brain, especially the neocortex - the part that underlies our highest cognitive functions and self-identity - cannot obviously be replaced as a whole organ.\n\n**Opportunity**  The neocortex can be replaced by progressively replacing tissue areas over time without significant disruption in function or self-identity (reviewed by Hébert and Vijg, 2018; and see for example Duffau, 2014, who documents the relocation over time of language without a disruption in speech in older adults in which the original language center was slowly destroyed due to disease). In addition, immature neocortical cells transplanted in mature neocortices develop normal synaptic connections and can respond normally to sensory input or elicit motor output (Falkner et al., 2016; Michelsen et al., 2015; Espuny-Camacho et al., 2013; and our data at[ Krzyspiak et al., 2022, Stem Cell Res](http://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.27.433204) 59:102642; and Quezada et al., 2023 https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.09.519776). These studies support the feasibility of age reversal for the neocortex via progressive tissue replacement. \n\n**Company Mission.** The purpose of the company is to\n● develop the technology to engineer functional tissue to replace brain tissue that is becoming impaired by age-related damage, and\n● commercialize this tissue and the methodology for its pre-clinical and clinical applications.\n\nHere, age-related brain damage refers to the normal accumulation over time of all forms of heterogeneous, covalent, non-enzymatic macromolecular changes associated with aging. Although such age-related damage occurs in the absence of disease, it also predisposes the brain to tissue loss as a result of strokes, tumors, and neurodegenerative conditions. The primary mission of the company will be to apply its technology to reverse age-related damage to prevent age-associated cognitive decline and disease, and secondarily or as steps toward the primary mission, to repair tissue loss when already caused by disease or trauma.\n\n**Scientific Background.** Evidence from across mammalian species, including humans into their 90s, has established the plastic nature of the brain, particularly of the neocortex (seat of our highest cognitive functions). This plasticity refers to the ability of brain functions to seamlessly change their neural substrates over time without an interruption in the use of said functions. Preclinical studies have provided ample proof-of-concept for the integration of transplant-derived neurons into existing adult brain circuits, including in cases of brain tissue loss or degeneration. The new neurons can exhibit appropriate electrophysiological responses to natural input, and when activated can elicit appropriate behavioral outputs. Although sparser, data from human studies using transplants to treat Parkinson’s support the notion that neuron precursors transplanted in the aged human brain can also functionally integrate. The plastic nature of brain function and tissue, together with the ability of young neurons to integrate into existing networks, underscore the need to develop replacement technology for repairing the loss of functional brain tissue.\n\n**Product Concept.** The engineered human brain tissue is a reassembly of the precursor cell types that comprise normal developing tissue, in such a way that their differentiation results in normal cell type ratios, cytoarchitecture, connectivity, and function. As a first step in the reassembly process, the Hébert lab has demonstrated the feasibility of using the adult mouse neocortex as a platform for rebuilding layered vascularized neocortical tissue in situ, with the integration of both neuronal and vascular components with the host (Quezada et al., 2023 https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.09.519776). Engineered tissue can be used to model human brain disease and perform drug screening, treat localized tissue loss, such as that due to trauma or stroke, and treat diffuse progressive loss of tissue function, such as that due to aging or neurodegeneration. For localized loss, the afflicted brain area is cleared of electrophysiologically silent tissue or scar tissue prior to tissue rebuilding. For diffuse loss of tissue integrity, tissue areas are sequentially rebuilt over time with concurrent progressive silencing of neighboring areas to allow memory and function to relocate.\n\n**Strategy in Brief.** The initial focus is on repairing damage to the neocortex (the largest and arguably most important part of the human brain), followed -with an overlap in time- by a focus on other brain areas. For the sole purpose of demonstrating proof of concept, the technology can be applied to non-age-related forms of damage in pre-clinical and clinical studies prior to its application to treating age-related brain diseases and aging itself.\n\n**Team**\n*Jean Hebert* is a professor of genetics and neuroscience at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He is an expert in the field of cell and tissue replacement for the adult neocortex to repair damage or age-related degeneration.\n*Ole Mensching* is a Co-founder of Apollo Health Ventures and HR expert focusing on team building. He founded CareerTeam, a headhunting agency with over 200 employees, and has built up several companies with TruVenturo as a partner and board member. Ole obtained his PhD with distinction at the Universities of Cologne and California, Berkeley, as the youngest and fastest-finishing postgraduate in his faculty.\n*Alexandra Quezada* earned her PhD in Neuroscience from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, during which she developed novel methods for cortical transplantations and reconstruction using cells and scaffolds. Currently, she is applying her skills and knowledge towards engineering brain tissue as the Lead Scientist at BE Therapeutics.\n*Davide Zanchi* is the CEO of BE Therapeutics and an entrepreneur in the life sciences. Before joining BE Therapeutics, Davide led drug development programs at Roche and spun off biotech companies from leading research institutions (Stanford, UCSF). Davide got his MBA from Stanford University and his PhD in Neuroscience from the University of Basel.\n\n**Company Timeline**\n* Year 1-2: Human Prototype Development\n  * Identification of cell types and ECM components\n  * Cell type generation/ ECM production\n  * Graft assembly - MVP\n* Year 3-4:In vivo prototype efficacy studies\n* Year 5+: Engage with FDA for clinical trials\n\n# **Senior Reviewer digest**\nThis proposal has been evaluated by three scientists and business experts, obtaining an average score of 4.3/5. The common consensus from senior reviewers and business/scientific advisors is that the project falls into the high-risk/high-reward category, with the very high risk being well recognized. \n\nBased on the feedback from the senior reviews, we summarized the strengths/weaknesses of the project below.\n\n**Strengths**\n* Robust experimental data: (i) demonstrating vascularization of neuronal precursor cells & promising results of graft construction and layer of grafts, (ii) a mouse model has been established to assess in vivo performance of several product types and to identify the most promising tissue composition and cytoarchitecture (cell types, ratio of cell types, different scaffolds and layering), (iii) Initial studies support that from human iPSCs relevant precursor cell types found in the neocortex can be generated.\n* Many  breakthrough opportunities to address a variety of diseases, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, age reversal, regeneration for spinal cord, and regeneration of nerves (reverse neuropathy). The technology could be used as for brain disease modelling and drug discovery with human brain tissue.\n * The scientific approach to replace all relevant brain cell types incl. neurons, glia, and vascular cells embedded in an ECM scaffold is strong. The approach builds on successes seen with cell- and tissue-engineered products composed of a single cell type while the key differentiator is the mimicking the variety of different cell types and cell type distribution in brain tissue.\n* Strong founding team: strong and longstanding scientific track record of the scientific founder\n*Apollo Health Ventures as co-investor into the NewCo is a good external validation of the project\n* Reasonable timeline: the proposed plan of 4 years for human prototype development and in vivo prototype efficacy studies seems reasonable given the complexity of this first in class tissue engineered product.  With stroke a meaningful entry indication is proposed, followed by several age-related degeneration conditions.\n\n**Risks**\n* May have challenges procuring and using fetal tissue due to ethical issues and regulatory burden. \n  * *Response from BE Corp*: A few fetal samples will be needed to guide the reverse engineering of fetal-like tissue. After a long search, BE Corp has approval and can receive the few necessary samples of live human and primate fetal tissue from multiple sources.\n* High risk & long-term project. Requires continued funding for 5-10 years just for research, unknown timeline on when transplantation in humans would be possible. The company likely needs $10-50 Million for 5 years. The initial funding likely only supports BE Therapeutics for 12-18 months. Future dilution of equity is expected.\n* Responses may differ between mouse and primate models and different source cells for the production of the brain tissue, thus conclusions from one model to the other are limited.\n\n**Other Feedback**\n* In some parts of the application it is proposed that lenti- or retroviruses will be used to transduce excitatory neuron precursors with hM4Di prior to tissue construction. This will need careful consideration as this has a high chance of negatively influencing the overall results. The team is encouraged to consider different approaches.\n* Due to the complexity and novelty of product development incl. questions on the best animal model, earlier regulatory interactions are strongly recommended, e.g. INTERACT (if granted) or in the EU at the national agency level. The advantage of EU regulatory bodies is that sponsors can come at a very early stage and discuss results in an iterative fashion.\n* No detailed plans for exploring the best immunosuppression regimen (as little as needed) are proposed. This should be considered. While a circumvention of immune rejection in brain cell transplants is not excluded, it is unlikely that the first clinical trial would proceed without a well-justified and explored immune suppression regime.\n* No plans on the surgical procedure and device for application into humans are presented. This should be considered and well-planned early on.\n* No information on plans for cGMP-compliant manufacturing and the development of methods to characterize critical quality attributes are provided. Due to the novelty of the approach early identification of an appropriate contract manufacturing organization is important.",

      "title": "VDP-75 The Longevist: A collection of the top longevity research ",
      "content": "\n# Problem\nIt is hard to judge the quality of academic research. Journal brand isn't a good proxy. \n\n# Solution\nA collection of the top longevity research voted on every quarter by a large body of longevity KOL (key opinion leaders). \n\n## Specification/FAQ\n\n### What is the Longevist?\n\nA curated collection of the most impactful longevity research every quarter, similar to an [overlay journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_journal). The name is supposed to evoke a similar magazine, The Economist.\n\n### Where do the articles come from?\n\nArticles will be sourced from [preprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprint) servers such as [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/), [MedRxiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/), and [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/). Also, researchers can submit their own articles to be considered by the Longevist. These articles will be paid articles.\n\n### Who chooses the articles that the Longevist votes on?\n\nA quorum of key opinion leaders (KOL) in the longevity space. We are aiming to have a mix of industry and academic KOLs. Recognizing that KOLs are busy, they can have teams that make recommendations to them and vote on their behalf. Also, ideally ahead of a work being posted on The Longevist, it would be independently peer reviewed in a public format such as on [TLDR](https://longevity.review).\n\n### How does the curation work?\n\nWe are aiming to recruit ~50 KOLs who will vote on the top 3-5 articles each quarter (4 times a year, March 31, June 30, September 30, December 31). Ideally, the Longevist would select 10-20 articles a year. Having such a small number should ensure that the Longevist focuses on truly impactful research. The KOLs can nominate articles to be voted on. The voting will be done on-chain. A majority 10 “yes” votes are needed to reach consensus. Once an article is accepted it will also be put on-chain. A larger more frequent voting will happen for paid articles. The precise mechanics of both are TBD. The infrastructure for doing the voting on-chain and putting the articles on-chain will be provided by [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) and [DeSciLabs](https://www.desci.com/), respectively.\n\n### What does on-chain mean?\n\nWe do put the articles on [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) storage for their permanence and provenance. Blockchains are significantly more robust for information permanence than a centralized database.\n\n### Will posting a preprint to The Longevist affect an article’s ability to be published in a traditional journal?\n\nNo. The Longevist is not a publisher. We are not modifying the content from the original preprint. We are simply curating what we hope to be the best preprints to help the field focus on impactful research.\n\n### Who leads the Longevist?\n\n[Tim Peterson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/petersontimr), VitaDAO Steward, Asst. Prof @ WashU, BIOIO founder. @timrpeterson \n\n@Rhys (Rhys Anderson). \n\n### How do I get involved?\n\nIf you or someone you know wants to vote on what gets curated, please connect to [tim@vitadao.com](mailto:tim@vitadao.com). Similarly, if you want to help build The Longevist, please reach out to Tim. USD and $VITA tokens are available to those who contribute. 500 $VITA are tentative amounts for voting per quarterly edition. Bonuses will be paid to those KOLs who recommend an article that gets voted on to be selected. Full and part-time positions are available for builders.\n\n### What does success look like?\nAs @vincent said\n\n[quote=\"vincent, post:2, topic:1028\"]\nCan see a lot of awareness and reputational value for VitaDAO, and ofc publishing is the core mechanism by which science is funded, and communicated\n[/quote]\n\nLike most websites and journals, we will track success in terms of page views, downloads, citations, tweets, etc. We will also consider tracking invited talks in longevity fora, and/or NIH grants earned by the PI in the years around publication. The Longevist aims to curate the best. This means success of each selected Longevist article should outperform the journal average in which it is eventually published.\n\n### Budget: What is the expected budget, and how will this budget be used and distributed among the team?\n\nWe anticipate needing one full-time admin or a few (2-3) part time admins. $50K USDC + 25K VITA is proposed maximum for the admins for the first year budget. More likely the admin budget would be closer to $10K USDC. $50K is for ~1000 hrs of work, 250 hrs per quarter. That’s six full-time weeks per three months, which would be unlikely. \n\nThe maximum KOL first year budget we’d need is 500 $VITA X 50 voters X 4 voting sessions per year = 100,000 $VITA. Future per year budgets would expected to be similar in terms of what is used in the first year in USD, but likely less $VITA as VitaDAO matures.",

      "title": " VDP-60 Seasonal Governance",
      "content": "# Summary\nThis proposal suggests a way to improve the governance process in VitaDAO, by “batching” governance into seasons, each season consisting of a Governance Phase and an Execution Phase. Each season lasts 4 months. Within season, the Governance Phase lasts 6 weeks and the rest is the Execution Phase.\n\nSeasonal governance provides the following advantages over the current way VitaDAO does governance:\n\n* **Separate governance and execution**. This separation allows better focus on the objective of each phase (discussions and voting during the governance phase, distraction-free execution during the execution phase).\n* **Time bound governance discussion and project execution**. Discussions and voting must end at the end of the governance phase, projects must complete execution at the end of the execution phase.\n* **Prioritise projects and goals better**. All goals and projects are considered at the same time, making the opportunity cost transparent. The DAO makes more intentional decisions on what to work on, instead of working on projects defined by a recent proposal.\n* **Generate better solutions to each problem**. Issues are presented to the community, and everyone is asked to help with proposals. An issue can be presented with 10 different proposals, as opposed to only 1 like right now.\n* **Create a schelling point for promotion and community involvement**. Interested community members are invited to gather at the same and have focused high-level conversations about the DAO, volunteer themselves for projects, and start contributing to the DAO.\n\n# Motivation\n## The Current Way\n\nThe current way VitaDAO does governance is “rolling” governance. Governance discussions are always happening, votes happen when they happen. There’s no deadline discussions or decisions.\n\nThe current way is also not friendly to decentralized contribution. Proposals almost always come from core members, because they’re the only people aware of what issues are being discussed.\n\nThe current way is also not effective, because most issues are addressed with a single proposal from a core contributor. Revision process is slow. Voting is difficult, due to a lack of viable alternatives if a voter happens to disagree with the one proposal.\n# Specification\n## The Seasonal Way\n\nInstead of rolling governance, in this proposal we “batch” our governance process. We do this by dividing our operation into seasons, where each season is 4 months long. Governance only happens during 6 weeks of each season, called the Governance Phase. The rest of the time is dedicated to execution, called the Execution Phase.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThis proposal suggests implementing an experimental first season for Jan-April 2023. A rough timeline for implementation:\n\n**Timeline**\n\n* First week of January: **Goals and Objectives**\n  * VitaCore and stewards publish a set of goals and objective s for the season\n* First two weeks of January: **Appeal Period**\n  * If any community member disagrees with a goal or objective proposed, they can start an appeal discussion and vote (e.g. “X should not be a goal yet”). The vote passes if a supermajority (66.67%) of tokens vote for it\n* Week 2-4 of January: **Proposal Submission**\n  * VitaCore and Steward publish calls for proposals to address certain goals. Anyone can submit proposals in response.\n  * For example, a goal could be to have a conflict resolution process. Anyone can submit proposals for what conflict resolution should look like. There can be several competing proposals for this goal.\n* Week 2 of January to Week 1 of February: **Proposal Discussion**\n  * Community members and contributors comment on submitted proposals\n  * They can also volunteer themselves for projects and initiatives\n  * Proposals may be modified, merged, or spilt up during this time\n* Week 1-2 February: **Voting**\n  * Proposals are voted on, teams are formed\n* Mid February - April: **Execution Phase**\n  * During the execution phase, we focus on executing the proposals that passed voting.\n  * Governance related discussions and proposals are minimized, until the next season. Exceptions can be made for urgent matters. Whether something is an urgent matter will be decided on by a majority vote among VitaCore.\n  * Project funding proposals are not part of seasonal governance! Funding proposals can be proposed and voted on any time",

      "content": "\n\n# Summary\n\nVitaDAO has been operating for just over a year, and as part of feedback received by working group members individually and through a series of internal discussions, we propose to adjust spending authorization limits and sign-off authority to establish better accountability and responsibility for achieving VitaDAO’s goals, while reducing operational delays in execution.\n\nThis proposal suggests modifications to [VDP-1](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40/16cess/479) and [VDP-6](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-6-vitadao-working-group-projects-framework/267)\n\n# Motivation\n\nVitaDAO has, since its inception, relied on a highly aligned core group of contributors (VitaCore) to jointly make decisions on operational spending, which was necessary in the absence of a formal system of requisition-approval-spend of working group treasury.\n\nDuring the past year, as VitaDAO has grown, the Operations Working Group developed a number of internal workflow tools, as well as using ecosystem-developed tools like Utopia and Parcel for payouts and is continuously evaluating systems such as Cryptio, Gilded, and other payment and accounting tools.\n\nMeanwhile, the volume of activity in VitaDAO has increased considerably and the volume of polls and requests for consensus through VitaCore around day-to-day operational expense approval has become an impediment to timely operational decisions and a time consuming exercise for VitaCore members.\n\nAs an extension to [VDP-69](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-69-proposal-to-realign-working-group-structures/960/4), we propose to change the approval authority and spending limits to allow for easier execution as follows:\n\n# Specification\n\n**Working Group expense less than $10,000 USD value equivalent**\n\nPrevious Limit: $2500 USD value equivalent (VDP-6)\n\nRequired: any two working group stewards to approve.\n\n**Working Group expense greater than $10,000 USD value equivalent, but less than $25,000 USD**\n\nPrevious Limit: Between $2500 and $10000 USD value equivalent ([VDP-6](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-6-vitadao-working-group-projects-framework/267?u=taliskermalt))\n\nRequired: majority vote in VitaCore\n\n**Working Group expense greater than $25,000 USD value equivalent, but less than $50,000 USD**\n\nPrevious Limit: Between $10000 and $25000 USD value equivalent ([VDP-6](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-6-vitadao-working-group-projects-framework/267?u=taliskermalt))\n\nRequired: Governance proposal and majority vote in Discourse (Phase 2 per VDP-1)\n\n**Working Group expense greater than $50,000 USD value equivalent or ANY project involving the Longevity Dealflow funding of projects (even if less than $50k)**\n\nPrevious Limit: >$50,000 USD value equivalent ([VDP-6](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-6-vitadao-working-group-projects-framework/267?u=taliskermalt))\n\nRequired: Phase 3 / on-chain governance\n\n# Implementation\n\nIf this proposal passes, the Coordination Working Group (formerly the Operations Working Group), shall re-align the signing authorities in the internal expense approval workflow.\n\n## Success metrics\n\n* Better execution times\n* Reduced burden on VitaCore members for non-strategic spending decisions.\n",

This lack of privacy and information symmetry can lead to manipulation or social pressure in the worst case as well as discourage people from voting altogether. \n\n# Motivation\n\nOne problem with the current voting process is that it allows people to see how others in the community have voted while the vote is still ongoing. This can influence the decisions of individual voters, who may be swayed by the choices of those around them, whether they know them personally or not.\n\nBy keeping votes private until the voting has ended, we can improve the governance process:\n\n* Voters can avoid being influenced by outside factors\n* Voters can make their decisions based solely on what they believe is best for the organization\n* This helps to avoid voter apathy: If a voter looks at preliminary results and they go clearly in one direction already, that might deter them from voting at all.\n* Makes it harder for large token holders (“whales”) to strategically sway proposals. If you can’t easily calculate how many votes you might need to win over or even “buy”, it becomes a lot harder to sway a proposal at the last minute.\n\n# Specification\n\n**Project lead and responsible for the implementation**: Schmackofant from the tech working group\n\nThis article from Snapshot describes how the “Shielded Voting” feature works:\nhttps://snapshot.mirror.xyz/yGz91njKbw-sXsnAT6RkoMzPwvuddZritz37h1OWO8o\n\n**From the Snapshot feature description**: “Shielded voting is a voting system in which the voter's choices are private during the voting period and get revealed when the proposal closes. This prevents the voting process itself from influencing the vote results.” \n\nPlease note that with “Shielded Voting” enabled, nobody will be able to see preliminary results for the proposals. The result (pass/fail for proposals with binary options) will only be revealed at the end.\n\nAlso, note that the current practice of observing how others (such as VitaDAO stewards or known ENS handles) vote and voting yourself accordingly (“soft delegation”) will not work anymore either. \nThis practice can be implemented through delegated voting though, which we suggest being implemented as well in a separate proposal:\nhttps://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-65-introducing-delegated-voting/\n\n# Implementation\n\nIf this proposal passes, Schmackofant and the tech working group will enable “[Shielded Voting](https://snapshot.mirror.xyz/yGz91njKbw-sXsnAT6RkoMzPwvuddZritz37h1OWO8o)” on VitaDAO’s [Snapshot space](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.vitadao.eth).\n",

      "content": "Summary: \nWe propose to allow token holders of VITA to delegate their voting rights to a delegate and wallet of their choice to vote on their behalf.\n\nWhy Delegate?\n- For those VITA token holders who may not have the time to actively participate in the governance and evaluation of the research proposals of VitaDAO, we suggest that they can delegate the voting power of their tokens to a volunter who has offered to take on this responsibility. These volunteers are known as delegates.\n\nDelegating your voting power:\n- If someone holds VITA, they have the option of assigning their voting power to a delegate. This can be done by accessing the delegate dashboard, which provides information about all available delegates, as well as their qualifications and applications. Through delegation, it is possible to ensure the community’s opinions and views are taken into account when voting. Furthermore, it is possible to reverse or cancel a delegation at any point.\n\nSpecification: \n- Tech contributors implement snapshot delegation strategy\n- Awareness + Community contributors: raises awarenes for people to apply as delegates\n- Ops contributors: onboard delegates, helps them setting up their identity/ens etc.\n- Longevity WG: raises awareness within their working group members to apply as delegates, helps onboarding them, potentially rewards active delegates?\n\nIncentives, Budget\n- As a starting point, 10k vested VITA tokens will be given to active delegates as a reward over the first 1-2 years, that this proposal squad is responsible for designing in a way that it is aligned with governance goals of especially growing governance participating by reputable longevity researchers.",

      "title": "VDP-69 Proposal to Realign Working Group Structures ",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nVitaDAO has been operating for just over a year, and as part of feedback received by working group members individually and through a series of internal discussions, we propose to re-align working group structures and governance to establish better accountability and responsibility for achieving VitaDAO’s goals, while empowering the contributors who are able to help the DAO accomplish those goals.\n\nThis proposal replaces/suggests modifications to [VDP-19](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-19-stewardship-process/479) / [VDP-36](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-36-stewardship-process-amendment-1/564), and [VDP-34.](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-34-defining-vitacore/562)\n\n# Team\nTodd White, Alex Dobrin, Laurence Ion, Theodor Beutel, Gavin, Hamza Qureshi\n\n\n# Motivation\n\nVitaDAO has done quite well in its first year of operations in establishing itself within the DeSci ecosystem. As part of this past year, contributors had to cope with many of the growing pains of a new organisation spanning everything from scaling dealflow, treasury management, human resources, legal, and operational challenges.\n\nFrom this, it has been determined that while the current working group structure as a whole works, there is a very clear opportunity for efficiency improvements via empowering individuals or squads to execute.\n\nWe propose that VitaDAO aligns around the concept of an execution layer and a consensus layer, with various contributors empowered to varying extents based on their role within each of those layers. To that end we propose the following structures and changes:\n\n# Specification\n\nToken holders\n\n* Token holders are the ultimate authority in what VitaDAO does, via the $VITA governance token\n* Token Holders vote in the Stewards.\n\nWorking Groups\n\n* Working Groups and their stewards are the execution layer.\n* The Legal, Governance, Tech & Tokenomics Working Groups will become Squads in a Coordination Working Group as they are called upon by the “Longevity Dealflow” or “Community & Awareness” Working Groups on an as-needed basis. They don’t require their own Working Group and budget.\n* A Membership Service Squad will be created to develop and deploy services for VitaDAO token holders to provide value\n* A fundraising squad\n* A dedicated marketing squad will be established within the Awareness Working Group to actively achieve outreach in the broader DeSci and public\n\nStewards\n\n* Stewards execute and make decisions on a day-to-day basis within the bounds empowered by the token holders.\n* Any Working Group member may nominate other members to the Stewards group. If the Stewards reject the nomination, VitaCore can ask for a tokenholder vote.\n* Stewards appoint VitaCore members.\n* VitaCore is an advisory group for strategic advice, they are not a “Board of Directors” who direct Stewards, but rather the opposite - VitaCore supports the Stewards. VitaCore members should be chosen to support a specific strategic objective of the DAO.\n\nMultisig Signers\n\n* The VitaDAO multi-sig signers (VDP-0)secure the multi-sig and execute the will of the DAO, as defined by the Token holders and Stewards. They are not a decision-making body.\n\nVitaCore\n\n* VitaCore helps support strategic initiatives, whether it be tokenomics, network growth, strategic partnerships, etc.\n* This is where many of the strategic contributors of VDP-54 will be able to provide value based on their networks and experience.\n* Ambassadors from other DAOs also can contribute here. VitaCore will be no larger than 10 people + stewards.\n\n# Implementation\n\nIf this proposal passes, the changes it introduces will be integrated into [VitaDAO’s constitution on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/about-the-vitadao-constitution-category/789). Internally, the affected working groups and squads will reorganise their tools and channels accordingly, such as Discord channels and working group calls.\n\nAhead of the [stewardship election](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-52-stewards-election-proposal-options/761/17?u=alexdobrin) , working group members will be invited to recommend candidates who will then be voted on by token holders. Within a month after the election, the elected stewards will appoint VitaCore members.\n\n## Success metrics\n\n* Better execution\n* Better operating margin\n",

      "title": "VDP-59 VitaDAO Governance Amendment #3",
      "content": "This proposal is a bulk proposal about seven, arguably relatively minor changes to VitaDAO's governance framework.\n\n# Summary\nThe governance working group suggests improving parts of [VDP-1](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40), [VDP-12](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-12-vitadao-governance-framework-amendment-1/374), the [Code of Conduct](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/code-of-conduct/302) and other governance proposals and governance-related documents to improve our governance processes.\n# Motivation\nSince the passing of [VDP-12 VitaDAO Governance Framework Amendment #1](http://vdp-12) and the failure of [VDP-37 VitaDAO Governance Amendment #2](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.vitadao.eth/proposal/0xae7d3512a47c773ce1b24ca6357ba6f412bf170cb49096741ed5c8f3c17d4192) achieving quorum – arguably due to the holiday season – several other issues with our current governance processes arose which may require intervention. This governance amendment is another umbrella proposal tackling several issues. For the current rule set on governance in VitaDAO, see [here](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vitadao-governance/787).\n\n# Specification\n\n## a) Time limit for phase 2 proposals\n\nWe propose to introduce a time limit of three months for phase 2 proposals. If a phase 2 proposal does not reach quorum and/or does not receive enough confirmatory votes three months after it was first posted to the Discourse governance forum, it has not passed phase 2 and the forum thread should be closed.\n\n##  b) Waiting period for revised phase 2 proposals\n\nWe propose to introduce a mandatory seven-day waiting period for phase 2 proposals after the last significant change to the proposal. A Vitacore majority will decide if the change in question qualifies as significant or not. Some examples of significant changes include changes that affect VitaDAO’s public image and the ones that revise the decision-making power and budget.\n\n##  c) Introduce governance of Snapshot roles (admins, authors)\n\nWe propose to introduce a formal on- and offboarding process for managers and/or authors on VitaDAO’s Snapshot space. While every VITA token holder is allowed to vote on Snapshot proposals, the authors have the right to upload proposals in addition to that. The admins, meanwhile, enjoy even more privileges. We suggest that [anyone who joins VitaCore](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-34-defining-vitacore/562) is also added to VitaDAO’s Snapshot space as an author, and [anyone who becomes a working group steward](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-19-stewardship-process/479) is added as an admin to the Snapshot space.\n\n##  d) Revise governance of Multisig\n\nWe propose to refine the on- and offboarding process of becoming a signer on VitaDAO’s multisignature wallets provided by Gnosis Safe, including the main multisig, the operations multisig and other, project-based multisigs such as, multisigs used for Gitcoin funding rounds. Since our multisig signers have to be extremely trusted, the election process should be optimised for security and steadiness.\n\nSigners of [VitaDAO’s main multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xF5307a74d1550739ef81c6488DC5C7a6a53e5Ac2/home)\n\n* require consent among VitaCore to be voted in\n* require a majority vote among VitaCore to be voted out\n\nThe current list of signers of the main multisig should be kept up to date through a comment in [this thread](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-0-vitadao-multisig-proposal/135).\n\nSigners of VitaDAO’s [longevity](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xc8cCB65E315A060B6f83A81E251616B262a135dE/balances), [operations](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x4472e37170B12c9Ab7aa1aF0903E8C392aad4CbB/balances) and project-based multisigs\n\n* Require a majority vote among VitaCore as well as confirmation by the operations working group steward to be voted in\n* Require a majority vote among VitaCore as well as confirmation by the operations working group steward to be voted out\n\nUpon the voting decision of a VitaDAO mulitsignature signer in/out, an update to the VitaDAO Governance Constitution is posted on Discourse with a post in the #cross-wg channel on Discord.\n\n##  e) User Types: Introducing “Stakeholders”\n\nWe propose to introduce “Stakeholders” as a new [user type](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40#user-types-2), defined as follows: “Stakeholders include VitaDAO members, working group members, service providers, VitaCore, as well as any other natural or legal persons who consider themselves affected by or otherwise interested in VitaDAO.”\n\nWe further propose to change all instances of “members” exclusively in [Phase 1: Ideation](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40#phase-1-ideation-14) and [Phase 2: Specification](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40#phase-2-specification-17) to “stakeholders”.\n\n## g) Reintroducing Proposals\n\nIn principle, VitaDAO members are free to propose anything at any time as per VitaDAO's governance framework. However, if a proposal is cancelled/voted out and is repeatedly reintroduced in an identical or nearly identical form right away, the community would likely treat such posts as spam under the Code of Conduct.\n\nWe propose to allow an identical or nearly-identical proposal that does not pass phase 3 on Snapshot to be reintroduced right away under certain circumstances.\n\nThis amendment will be useful, for instance, when a phase 3 proposal on Snapshot does not reach quorum and there is reason to believe that this is the result of external factors, such as holiday seasons, interfering with otherwise clean voting process. Another example where the amendment is relevant is a situation where a vote is flipped at the very last minute through a significant number of tokens and there is reason to believe that others refrained from voting because they did not expect such a flip to happen.\n\nSince all qualifying circumstances cannot be exhaustively defined, the decision of whether a proposal is eligible to be reintroduced will be undertaken by VitaCore through majority vote on a case-by-case basis. The proposal author is responsible for requesting a reintroduction of their proposal, and in case of a dispute, can trigger the Dispute Resolution Process.\n\n##  h) Improving the Code of Conduct\n\nWe propose to amend the Code of Conduct with the following:\n\n* Governance participation with a Conflict of Interest is forbidden. Any member of a working group or VitaCore with a potential conflict of interest must disclose the conflict to VitaCore and abstain from governance participation, which includes voting and the discussion of the vote. A conflict of interest is anything a reasonable person (or arbitrator) might believe results in competing professional or personal obligations or personal or financial interests that would make it difficult to participate fairly in governance. Members of a working group or VitaCore are subject to fiduciary duties to act in good faith for the benefit of the VitaDAO token holders and the broader community as a whole.\n\n* In case of doubt about whether a case qualifies as a conflict of interest, the legal working group of VitaDAO will make that decision through soft governance among its contributors (Discord tag \"Legal WG Contributor\", excluding guests) in its Discord chat \"#legal-wg\" or using an appropriate alternative, such as a legal working group call.\n* Conflicts of interests must be disclosed in the corresponding proposal (in phase 1, in phase 2 on Discourse, and in phase 3 on Snapshot) as well as other relevant channels, such as the Vitacore channel or a working group channel on Discord. Conflicts of interest not disclosed prior to governance participation can result in a reprimand, a penalty, or restrictions from the DAO.\n\n\n* Any member of the DAO can submit a suspected breach of the Code of Conduct by another member of the DAO to trigger the Dispute Resolution Process that will include the authority to reprimand, penalise or restrict any member of the DAO. Any reprimand, penalty or restriction on participaction will be handled according to the VitaDAO dispute resolution guidelines.\n\nUpon passing of this proposal, the revised Code of Conduct should be communicated appropriately. This includes a checkbox in the application and onboarding forms for new working group members, as well as prominent and reoccurring placements in our communication channels, including Discord, Telegram, email and Twitter.\n\n# Implementation\n\nIf this proposal passes phase 2 as well as the Snapshot vote, all amendments will be implemented by the governance working group in collaboration with the technical working group and incorporated into the governance thread in our [‘VitaDAO Constitution](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vitadao-governance/787)’ summarising the latest state of all VDPs including updates and amendments such as this proposal.",

      "title": "VDP-58 Proposal to Accept Funds",
      "content": "\n\n# Summary\n\nFollowing the proposals [VDP-11](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-11-new-10-vita-mint-for-treasury-strategic-contributors/407/30) (Authorization to Mint),[ VDP-24](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-24-vitadao-spv-for-strategic-contributors/517/12) (Special Purpose Vehicle), and [VDP-54](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-54-institutional-genesis-raise/812/8) (Institutional Genesis Raise), this proposal requests the community authorise the Operations and Legal Working Groups to undertake the necessary legal and financial steps to receive funding as contemplated in [VDP-54](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-54-institutional-genesis-raise/812/8).\n\nThese steps include minting additional $VITA as contemplated in [VDP-11](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-11-new-10-vita-mint-for-treasury-strategic-contributors/407/30), setup of the appropriate legal vehicle to allow participation of strategic contributors per [VDP-24](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-24-vitadao-spv-for-strategic-contributors/517/12), and accepting of funds from those [strategic contributors](https://gov.vitadao.com/c/proposals/strategic-contributor-proposals/32).\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe longevity/dealflow and awareness working groups request further resources to continue funding projects, as well as expand the awareness of VitaDAO. As [VDP-11 laid out](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-11-new-10-vita-mint-for-treasury-strategic-contributors/407/11), working group members believe it would be beneficial to the mission of VitaDAO to invite strategic members to contribute their expertise and capital, and to receive VITA governance tokens. By onboarding strategic members, VitaDAO will fill up its treasury, benefit from their unique value-add contributions, thereby accelerating its mission of funding longevity research.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe Operations Working Group shall coordinate the execution as follows:\n\n1. Tokenomics and Tech Working Groups members shall execute a minting of $VITA tokens to the Treasury in the amounts provided by the Operations Working Group, in accordance with [VDP-11](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-11-new-10-vita-mint-for-treasury-strategic-contributors/407/30) not to exceed 10% of the Total Token Supply. This will result in 40% of the Total Token Supply having been minted, of which it is anticipated between 36-37% will enter into Circulating Supply as a direct result of VDP-54 and this proposal.\n\n2. The Operations Working Group shall authorise an agent and legal counsel to prepare a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) as originally contemplated in [VDP-24](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-24-vitadao-spv-for-strategic-contributors/517/12). However, subsequent discussions between Operations and Legal Working Groups has determined that the jurisdiction for the SPV shall be changed from that proposed in VDP-24: from Swiss jurisdiction to Canadian in deference to the strategic contributors who require this vehicle for legal and taxation purposes.\n\n3. The Legal Working Group shall facilitate the execution of agreements from strategic contributors in return for governance rights, the receipt of which shall authorise the Operations Working Group to issue governance tokens to a mutually acceptable custodian who shall release the tokens in accordance with a 4-year linear release schedule.\n\n4. The Operations Working Group shall move to a separate wallet and custodian all VITA from the Treasury currently accrued under [VDP-3](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-3-vitadao-tokenomics-proposal/64/30) which remains to be vested or otherwise distributed to the founding group of contributors and service providers for the purpose of maintaining transparency in reporting.\n\n# Implementation\n\nThe Operations Working Group proposes to receive an initial tranche of $2,3m USD as contemplated in VDP-54 and executed under this proposal.\n\nFurther tranches are coming up in future proposals\n\n## Success metrics\n\nThe Institutional Genesis Raise is deemed successful when the treasury grows by at least $4 million USD equivalent with the Strategic Members fit for VitaDAO.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe successful approval of this proposal will result in a request for capital contributions to be issued to committed strategic contributors in this first tranche on or about October 7th, 2022.\n\n## Budget\n\nThe budget allocation for legal, taxation and accounting services including incorporation of the SPV, associated with this proposal is estimated at 25 000 USDC\n",

      "content": "This proposal intends to get approval for the tokenomics working group to sell upcoming airdropped tokens at their judgement, depending on market conditions and necessity.\n\n# Summary\nEthereum will have the upcoming merge and move to proof of stake, it's anticipated that there will be a proof of work fork similarly to Ethereum classic in the past that everyone with $ETH (POW) will get airdropped, including VitaDAO.\n\nVitaDAO also received an approximate 20k $SAFE airdrop, which isn’t live yet, but given VitaDAO would benefit from liquidity to fund upcoming research proposals I’d propose that we sell up to half of the airdrop based on market cap and conditions for DAI stable coins if that is necessary for funding upcoming research funding proposals, and re-consider what we do with the other half a few months later. Given VitaDAO's interest in SafeDAO as a user of Safe, we will strongly consider whether this sell is necessary to generate liquidity for funding longevity research.\n\n# Proposal\nI propose we wait until after the merge and observe how other DAOs handle the execution of a sell, especially players such as Nexus Mutual or Gnosis with large Ether holdings and sophisticated treasury teams.\n\nIf the possibility and liquidity exist we should explore selling the $ETH (POW) through our operations multisig. And if it won’t trade on decentralized exchanges with sufficient liquidity we should explore to grant a 3rd party (most likely someone from the multisig) the ability to send the forked $ETH (POW) funds to a centralized exchange for execution of a sell and sending back the proof of stake ether. We will remain extra diligent because there is a high amount of phishing and fake ETH POW getting airdropped, so we’ll rather wait and observe until we have clarity on the best steps to benefit the DAO from this fork.\n\nThe proof of stake ether generated in this sell would be used for our mission and purpose of funding longevity research.\n\nhttps://forum.nexusmutual.io/t/getting-ready-for-an-upcoming-ethereum-pow-fork/893\n\nhttps://forum.gnosis-safe.io/t/proposal-safe-distribution-for-users/369\n\nhttps://twitter.com/OlimpioCrypto/status/1557751721463521282\n",

      "title": "VDP-53 [Funding] The Longevity Decentralized Review (TLDR) - Uber for peer review service",
      "content": "### TL;DR\n\nThe Longevity Decentralized Review (TLDR) is an on-demand service that funds peer review using funds from those who submit their research to be reviewed. TLDR will also accept donations. The focus of the content will be longevity research posted to preprint servers, Biorxiv, Medrxiv, and Arxiv. TLDR will benefit VitaDAO in three ways: 1) VitaDAO will grow its treasury by taking in revenue from TLDR. 2) VitaDAO will grow longevity knowledge because TLDR is focused on longevity research. 3) It will augment VitaDAO’s longevity dealflow by creating a larger more decentralized community evaluating longevity research. \n\n### Problem\n\nPublishing in journals especially in the biomedical sciences has significant issues. Journals historically provided an important function in physically printing research manuscripts. However, now with the internet anyone can make their work accessible by posting it online. Researchers are now doing this at several websites that are known as “Rxiv” (pronounced “archive”) preprint servers. Biorxiv, Medrxiv, and Arxiv are examples.\n\nThe remaining major distinction between a journal and any website on the internet is that journals have peer review. Peer review is the process of scientists reviewing each other’s work to determine if the work is worthy of publishing. In most cases, scientists recommend other scientists with similar domain expertise to a journal to review their work. Scientists then often spend many hours assessing the quality of results and suggesting changes. Often, there can be several rounds of revision.\n\nThis is a system that benefits the world that scientists take pride in, with one major issue – The journals do not pay scientists for any of this work. Rather, the journals charge large and growing fees (many $thousands) to scientists for the privilege of publishing in their journals. The journals have little costs because scientists do most of the work for free. This results in journals having massive profit margins. Some estimates have journals outdoing the profit margins even of some of the most successful companies on earth such as Apple.\n\nTo recap, scientists pay journals from their increasingly inadequate non-profit funding budgets to have other scientists do free labor reviewing for the journal. It is widely acknowledged by many that this is an unacceptable exploitative system that needs to change.\n\n### Solution\n\nAn on-demand peer review service where reviews are paid by those who submit their research as well as by donations. The business model involves taking in funds that will cover what is paid out. To grow VitaDAO’s treasury, ideally the funds taken in would be in fiat and those paid out would be in $VITA. VitaDAO also benefits in that TLDR is focused on longevity research. Thus, TLDR will help scale and decentralize its core mission of evaluating longevity research.\n\nAs the name implies, a major goal of TLDR is to enable researchers to have proof of their peer reviews such that they don’t need to rely on journals for this proof.\n\n### Benefits\n\n* Reviewers should have the option of being compensated for their efforts.\n* Researchers will obtain peer reviews of their work in a timely and fair fashion.\n* The general public won’t have to wait (often for years) for research to be published in a journal to know whether it's credible.\n* Journals will profit less from the free labor of researchers.\n* TLDR will not interfere with the status quo. It is an opt-in mechanism for researchers to get extra eyes on their work.\n* TLDR will have a simple web interface with a familiar UX. No new skills will be needed. Web3 aspects will be abstracted away, which is important because most biomedical scientists won’t be familiar with Web3.\n* This is intended to augment longevity dealflow  evaluation in general to benefit more longevity organizations than just VitaDAO. The goal is to follow the spirit of how @vincentweisser initiated the [The Longevity Prize](https://www.longevityprize.com/) by pulling in the Foresight Institute, the Methuselah foundation, and others.\n* The initial focus is longevity, but similar to Stackoverflow and StackExchange or Reddit and its subreddits, this service will hopefully evolve to handle other research domains.\n\n\n### Specification\n\nThere are two types of submissions. Those that will be auto-submitted and those that will be manually submitted by researchers. TLDR will be regularly auto-updated with the longevity research from Biorxiv, Medrxiv, and Arxiv. Researchers will also be able to pay to directly post their work. Thus, TLDR has two tiers, free and paid. Reviewers are incentivized to review the freely posted Rxiv submissions because they will receive a portion of the overall donations. Reviewers are more incentivized to review the paid submissions because they will get a portion of the overall donations plus a portion of the overall paid submissions.\n\nPaid submissions will be handled as a subscription model like how software as a service (SAAS) often operates. Potential pricing tiers were determined based on [polling](https://twitter.com/timrpeterson/status/1548736761240731649?s=20&t=UuyLOT564MXj12CEx-SoeA). This polling showed $250/manuscript would be acceptable to ~50% of those polled. ~50% of people wouldn’t pay thus, the free tier accommodates them. The subscription model is tentatively $249/year per manuscript with lower per manuscript amounts the more manuscripts one submits. One also pays less if they pay yearly vs. monthly. To us, it appears more beneficial to manuscript submitters to allow reviews to accumulate over time rather than to restrict a manuscript to a certain number of reviews. Said another way, a time-based subscription payment model rather than a pay-per-review model seems better for researchers. A subscription model also seems better as a business model for TLDR/VitaDAO because it has lower friction. With subscriptions one only pays one time whereas with pay-per-review one would have to decide to pay each time they want another round of reviews.\n\n*Pay-in:* Fiat. Most researchers who will pay for this service will not be Web3 natives. Thus, to achieve adoption it will be critical to facilitate fiat on-ramp. Donors will be more likely Web3 native, so BTC, ETH, and USDC are the initial coins that will be accepted. A range of fiat options (especially credit cards), provided by the well-known payment provider, Stripe, will be used for both paid submissions and donations.\n\n*Pay-out:* VITA tokens. The specific amounts will be TBD depending on market conditions and what will make business sense to VitaDAO. Tentative amounts that are coded into the website are:\n\n* 2 $VITA per upvote of a review. -2 $VITA per downvote of a review\n* 1 $VITA per upvote of a reply to a review. -1 $VITA per downvote of a reply\n* 1 $VITA per upvote of a manuscript that someone pays to have reviewed. There is no downvoting manuscripts, as we don't want to discourage people paying to have their work reviewed.\n\nThe Web3 aspect of this project will grow over time. Besides receiving donations in BTC, ETH, or USDC and paying out in VITA, one can imagine formalizing the “proof of peer review” concept by making the reviews and voting on-chain. One can also imagine more tokens besides VITA to be used for payouts. For example, LabDAO’s $LAB token could be used. In that case, the content that could be submitted would have to be expanded beyond longevity.\n\n*Team:* Tim Peterson, Rhys Anderson, Vincent Weisser, Johannes Weniger\n\n**Initial ask from VitaDAO**: 20,000 $VITA tokens to have funds available to pay out to reviewers. This should increase our tokenholder base. We also plan to fundraise via [Gitcoin's GR15](https://gitcoin.co/blog/level-up-your-grant-for-gr15/) happening this upcoming September. GR15 has a dedicated DeSci round, so this seems a good fit for creating awareness.\n",

      "title": "VDP-54 [Governance] Institutional Genesis Raise ",
      "content": "Proposal to allocate approximately 6% of the total VITA token supply to new strategic contributors admitted as institutional members of VitaDAO.\n\n\n\n# Summary\n\n**VitaDAO has received a good deal of high-level interest from institutions in the biopharma space in becoming VitaDAO members. The DAO could benefit from adding such strategic contributors with cutting-edge industry knowledge and deep networks. Institutional members will extend VitaDAO’s reach, advance VitaDAO’s mission, and enable additional longevity research funding, dealflow, and community awareness.**\n\n**Following VDP-11 we propose allocating approximately 6% of the total VITA token supply to new strategic contributors admitted as institutional members of VitaDAO pursuant to the application process described herein.**\n\n# Motivation\n\nAs [VDP-11 laid out](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-11-new-10-vita-mint-for-treasury-strategic-contributors/407/11), working group members believe it would be beneficial to the mission of VitaDAO to invite strategic contributors into the DAO through an Institutional Genesis Raise In order to continue its mission of funding longevity research with institutional support.\n\n# Specification\n\nThe Institutional Genesis Raise aims to raise at least 4m USD in mission-aligned funding by auctioning ~6% of the total VITA supply (3.86M VITA) to strategic contributors selected by the VitaDAO community. Strategic contributors will purchase VITA directly from the DAO Over-The-Counter (OTC) and through a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) created pursuant to VDP-24. It is envisaged that 1.447.500 VITA will be allocated for direct OTC purchase and 2.412.500 VITA will be available for purchase via the VDP-24 SPV subject to final commitments.\n\n\nAn individual or entity can make a proposal to VitaDAO to become a strategic contributor with a written application to the VitaDAO community.\n\n## Ticket sizes\n\nTwo ticket sizes are available.\n\n* 6 slots at a minimum of 250k USD\n* 5 slots at a minimum of 500k USD\n\nA further allocation of up to 500k USD is reserved for smaller tickets accepted on a case-by-case basis by the community.\n\nA 250k slot entitles the strategic contributor to become an observer across VitaDAO’s working groups. Each 500k slot comes with regular appointments with VitaDAO’s working groups to stay informed and exclusive access to VitaDAO’s IP including a first right to purchase developed IP, or in the case of Decentralised Tech Transfer (DTT) projects, right of first refusal to participate in initial capitalization of spin-off entities.\n\n## Governance process\n\nThe operational process for strategic contributors to apply and contribute is as follows:\n\n1. This proposal shall be voted upon and brought into force.\n2. A potential strategic contributor shall register their interest by sending an e-mail to Todd White, Operations Steward ( [todd@vitadao.com](mailto:todd@vitadao.com) ).\n3. Each strategic contributor will be requested to submit their proposal to the legal and operations working groups which will work with each strategic contributor to align and finalise their application.\n4. Once the proposal is accepted in principle, each strategic contributor will sign an Expression of Interest (EOI) to purchase governance tokens..\n5. Once all the EOI are collected, the VITA price is locked and announced.\n6. Each strategic member will have its proposal shared with the community which will be introduced and published by Todd White, Steward of the Operations Working Group ( [todd@vitadao.com](mailto:todd@vitadao.com) ), in the “[Ideas](https://gov.vitadao.com/c/ideas/1)” section on Discourse as part of Phase 1 governance.\n7. Subsequently, a proposal identifying the participants in each tranche shall be published in the “[Proposals](https://gov.vitadao.com/c/proposals/workinhg-group-proposals/13)” section on Discourse as part of Phase 2 governance.\n8. The governance working group shares the same proposal on Snapshot in compliance with Phase 3 governance.\n9. If there is demand for a second or third tranche of the raise, steps 6-8 are repeated.\n\n# Implementation\n\n## Success metrics\n\nThe Institutional Genesis Raise is deemed successful if the treasury grows by at least 4 million USD equivalent.\n\n## Timeline\n\n* Discuss and vote on VDP-54 in the second half of August\n* Evaluate initial introductions by strategic contributors in the second half of August.\n* Discuss and vote on the first tranche of the raise by September 12th.\n* If there is further interest, evaluate introductions by more strategic contributors in September\n* If there is interest, discuss and vote on the second tranche of the raise by the end of September\n\n## Budget\n\nThis proposal does not ask for an additional budget. The required token allocation was approved in VDP-11. The work is being done by working group members.\n",

      "title": " VDP-37 [Governance] VitaDAO Governance Amendment #2",
      "content": "The governance working group suggests improving parts of [VDP-1 ](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40), [VDP-12 ](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-12-vitadao-governance-framework-amendment-1/374), the [Code of Conduct](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/code-of-conduct/302) and other governance proposals and governance-related documents to further improve our governance processes.\n\n# Motivation\nIn the four months since [VDP-12 VitaDAO Governance Framework Amendment #1 ](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-12-vitadao-governance-framework-amendment-1/374), several more issues with our current governance processes arose which may require modification. This second amendment to [VDP-1 ](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40) is an umbrella proposal with several issues that need to be discussed independently.\n\n# Specification\n\n## a) Phase 3: Increasing the Quorum\n\n*[Corresponding section in VDP-1](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40#phase-3-consensus-20)*\n\nWe propose to increase the quorum for phase 3 votes on Snapshot from 965K VITA to 1.2M VITA which is about 8% of VITA’s circulating supply as of May 2022.\n\n## b) Phase 2/3: Not merging Phases 2 and 3 to Always Require a Snapshot Vote\n\n*[Corresponding section in VDP-1](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40#phase-2-specification-17)*\n\nWe propose **not** to merge phases 2 and 3 but put this question up for discussion.\n\nThe argument made was that Discourse polls are prone to manipulation as they are ‘one account one vote’ and Discourse accounts are neither tied to KYC/SSID, token ownership, nor to any other limiting factor, except [Discourse Trust Levels](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/) which provide spam protection only to some degree. This is particularly relevant for proposals that do not require a phase 3 vote but end at phase 2.\n\nImproving this process could include increasing the thresholds for soft governance to include proposals that formerly counted as low-stakes phase 2 proposals. Proposals beyond that threshold would be discussed on Discourse for a given amount of time and then being voted on through a token-weighted vote on Snapshot. There would be no more Discourse poll involved.\n\n## c) User Types: Introducing “Stakeholders”\n\n*[Corresponding section in VDP-1](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40#user-types-2)*\n\nWe propose to introduce “Stakeholders” as a new [user type](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40#user-types-2), defined as follows: “Stakeholders include VitaDAO members, working group members, service providers, VitaCore, as well as any other natural or legal persons who consider themselves affected by or otherwise interested in VitaDAO.”\n\nWe further propose to change all instances of “members” exclusively in [Phase 1: Ideation](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40#phase-1-ideation-14) and [Phase 2: Specification](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40#phase-2-specification-17) to “stakeholders”.\n\n## d) Improving the Code of Conduct\n\nCurrently, the [Code of Conduct](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/code-of-conduct/302) reads as follows:\n\n> **OVERVIEW**\n>\n> The VitaDAO community contains professionals and volunteers from all over the world working in many different capacities including investigating intellectual property, leading working groups, writing code, managing events, and managing social channels. Diversity is one of our strengths, but it can sometimes give rise to miscommunication and conflict. To ensure that all of our contributors feel welcome and valued, our code of conduct establishes clear expectations for participants in VitaDAO. It is not intended to serve as an exhaustive list of prohibited behavior, but rather, a set of principles for maintaining a healthy and inclusive community. This code of conduct applies to all activities of VitaDAO. In some cases, violations of this code may affect a person’s ability to participate in our community.\n>\n> **REPORTING VIOLATIONS**\n>\n> Please report any code of conduct violations by reaching out to an admin in one of VitaDAO’s channels or by [email](mailto:dao@vitadao.io). We are committed to protecting the privacy and safety of anyone who reports a violation.\n>\n> **CODE OF CONDUCT**\n>\n> Be friendly and patient. Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.\n>\n> Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.\n>\n> Be respectful. People working together will inevitably disagree or become frustrated with one another at times, but conflict is no excuse for bad behavior or personal attacks. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Be respectful of one another and those outside our community who interact with us. Be careful in the words that you choose. Conduct yourself professionally.\n>\n> Be kind to others. Refrain from all forms of harassment, including: Violent threats or language directed against another person. Discriminatory jokes and language. Posting sexually explicit or violent material. Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”). Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms. Unwelcome sexual attention. Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior. Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.\n>\n> Be understanding. Strive to resolve disagreements constructively. Our contributors come from different backgrounds and have different perspectives. If you disagree with someone, seek to understand their perspective and share yours respectfully.\n\nWe propose to keep the above version of the Code of Conduct in place *and* add the following below:\n\n> Governance participation with a Conflict of Interest is forbidden. Any member of a working group or VitaCore with a potential conflict of interest must disclose the conflict to VitaCore and abstain from governance participation, which includes voting and the discussion of the vote. A conflict of interest is anything a reasonable person (or arbitrator) might believe results in competing professional or personal obligations or personal or financial interests that would make it difficult to participate fairly in governance. Members of a working group or VitaCore are subject to fiduciary duties to act in good faith for the benefit of the VitaDAO token holders and broader community as a whole. \n>\n> In case of doubt about whether a case qualifies as a conflict of interest, the legal working group of VitaDAO will take that decision through soft governance among its contributors (Discord tag \"Legal WG Contributor\", excluding guests) in its Discord chat \"#legal-wg\" or an appropriate alternative, such as a legal working group call.\n>\n> Conflicts of interests must be disclosed in the corresponding proposal (in phase 1, in phase 2 on Discourse, and in phase 3 on Snapshot) as well as other relevant channels, such as the Vitacore channel or a working group channel on Discord. Conflicts of interest not disclosed prior to governance participation can result in a reprimand, a penalty, or removal from the DAO.\n>\n> Any member of the DAO can submit a suspected breach of the Code of Conduct by another member of the DAO for Dispute Resolution that will include the authority to reprimand, penalise or expel any member of the DAO.\n\n\nMoreover, the Code of Conduct will be amended with a brief explanation of and further resources on the Dispute Resolution Process, should the corresponding proposal pass.\n\nUpon passing of this proposal, the revised Code of Conduct should be communicated appropriately. This includes a checkbox in application and onboarding forms for new members joining working groups, as well as prominent and reoccurring placements in our communication channels, including Discord, Telegram, email and Twitter.\n\n\n## e) [deleted]\n\n\n## f) Reintroducing Proposals\n\nIn principle, VitaDAO members are free to propose anything at anytime as part of VitaDAO's governance framework. However, if a proposal was cancelled/voted out and repeatedly reintroduced in an identical or nearly identical form right away, the community would likely treat such posts as spam under the Code of Conduct. \n\nWe propose to allow an identical or nearly-identical proposal that did not pass phase 3 on Snapshot to be reintroduced right away under certain circumstances.\n\nOne such reason could be if a phase 3 proposal on Snapshot does not reach quorum and if there is reason to believe that this is not intentional but due to external factors, such as holiday seasons. Another potential reason could be if a vote is flipped at the very last minute through a significant number of tokens and if there is reason to believe that others refrained from voting because they did not expect such a flip to happen.\n\nSince the list of appropriate circumstances could not be exhaustively defined, the decision whether a proposal is eligible to be reintroduced will be taken by VitaCore through majority vote on a case-by-case basis. The proposal author is responsible to request a reintroduction of their proposal to a member VitaCore and, in case of a dispute, can trigger a Dispute Resolution Process.\n\n# Implementation\n\nIf this proposal passes phase 2 as well as the Snapshot vote, all amendments will be implemented by the governance working group in collaboration with the technical working group and incorporated into the document ‘Bylaws for the DAO’ summarising the latest state of all VDPs including updates and amendments such as this proposal.",

      "title": "VDP-49 [Funding] MenoAge - A glycomics-based blood biomarker for female aging",
      "content": "\nThis proposal asks for 250.000 USD to fund [MenoAge](https://menoage.co.uk/)  - A Glycomics based blood biomarker  for detection of perimenopause and menopause transition to enable timely access to therapy.\n\n**Shepherds:** Maria Marinova, Maximilian Unfried\n**Scientific & IP Evaluation Team:**  Diane Seimetz, Lutz Kummer, Sebastian Brunemeier, Tovah Wolf\n\n\n# Summary\nMenoAge is a perimenopause diagnostic, which is an accurate, rapidly deployable, and cost-effective. It assesses the long-term impact of common therapeutic interventions for management of menopause or of premature ovarian insufficiency impacting women´s health and longevity. Early detection of perimenopause will lead to prompt, personalized treatment, thus preventing and alleviating (peri)menopausal symptoms associated with aging and improving future health by reducing the risk of age-related diseases and mortality.\n\n# Motivation\n\n*Briefly describe what problem this aims to solve. Why is this a problem worth solving? If this impacts the user, explain how it impacts them. If it helps, frame the problem as a pain point to the VitaDAO community.*\n\nWhile women live longer than men on average, they spend more time in poor health with increased incidence of age-related diseases commonly associated with menopause. Menopause can have severe health and psychological consequences such as heart diseases, osteoporosis, diabetes, and dementia influencing women’s social relationships and overall quality of life and longevity. Women’s reproductive aging, healthy aging and gender equality are therefore inextricably linked, yet female reproductive aging remains an understudied topic.\nThere is a potential for Hormone Replacement Therapy(HRT) to relieve these phenotypes, but we can only get the full effect if the treatment is started on time. If HRT is given after the menopause transition, the patient has already lost a lot of estrogen receptors and will not be able to respond to estrogen as before. The problem is that currently menopause is diagnosed retrospectively, and the HRT administration is not optimal. In the UK, timely treatment of perimenopause could save the NHS over £0.5 billion. A validated prognostic biomarker that would monitor the effectiveness of the personalized therapy, therefore, has a game-changing potential for the menopausal care pathway and could revolutionize the management of female health and aging.\n\n11 million women in the UK alone are in an age of peri(menopause) and 8.8 million experience symptoms. They spend $20 000 in the span of 4-10 years on the menopause journey, including doctor visits, treatments, and other wellness products. Hence the TAM of this project is estimated to be  $17.5 billion, with a SAM of $11 billion.\n\n\n# Specification\nMenoAge is designed to be a novel biomarker for monitoring highly personalised approach to HRT benefits vs. risks of ongoing therapy, in connection to ageing and long-term health outcomes. It is intended to replace the currently inadequate hormone tests for perimenopause detection and assess the effectiveness of HRT on woman´s healthy lifespan. The retrospective cohort study conducted from 1984-2017 on 105,200 healthy UK women taking HRT, with an average follow- up of 13 years, found a 9-14% reduction in overall mortality for HRT users resulting in longer and healthier lifespan. MenoAge will thus represent a powerful, game-changing, and cost- effective tool aimed at improving female reproductive health and, consequently, supporting woman´s longevity.\nThey propose immunoglobulin G (IgG) glycans as a biomarker of perimenopause onset, and a safe and effective hormonal replacement therapy determination for monitoring of healthy female aging. IgG is a molecule involved in multiple functions of our immune system, one of them being the regulation of the overall immune activation threshold and inflammation level. As a part of the inflammaging process, IgG glycan composition changes towards more inflammatory as we age, with women showcasing a pronounced stepwise decline at menopause, indicating this as a “rapid aging” period. Accordingly, a study on close to 2000 women found that IgG glycosylation pattern “ages” at a higher rate during perimenopause. Most importantly, estrogen supplementation can entirely prevent inflammatory changes of IgG glycome caused by chemically induced menopause. \n\n\n**Project Lead: Who is leading this project? If approved, is that person willing to take on the Team role of lead for the project’s duration? Please mention their Discord username(s) here.**\n\n**Team:**\n Prof Gordan Lauc, project lead, glauc@genos.hr (founder of Genos research labs, Gordan is the inventor of the GlycanAge test and company CSO)\n\nDr Julija Jurić, lead scientist, [jjuric@genos.hr](mailto:jjuric@genos.hr) (employed with Genos for 7+ years)\n\nDr Marija Pezer, lead scientists, mpezer@genos.hr (employed with Genos for 7+ years)\n\nDr Frano Vuckovic, lead biostatistician, fvuckovic@genos.hr (employed with Genos for 7+ years)\n\nDr Louise Newson, principal investigator, louise.newson@newsonhealth.co.uk (research collaborator for 2+ years)\n\nDr Felix Agakov, AI and machine learning, felix@pharmaticsltd.com (collaborator for over 10+ years)\n\nDr Samir Khan, health economics and market access, samkhanicgeb@gmail.com (Market access consultant at GlycanAge for 1.5 years)\n\nNikolina Lauc, commercial director, nikolina@glycanage.com (CEO at GlycanAge for 2+ years)\n\nZorrie Dimitrova, operations manager, [zorrie@glycanage.com](mailto:zorrie@glycanage.com) (Operations manager at GlycanAge for 4+ years)\n\n\n\n**Description of what is being funded:**\nThe MenoAge test is already developed - it is measuring the same Glycans as the GlycanAge test which is already on the market. The goal of the funded project is mainly about clinical evaluation of the test  - for clinicians to evaluate it as a tool in practice and that it is useful and helps decision making.\n\nWe know the test responds to menopause therapy, it changes before the last cycle stops, etc. , however the time between testing has been generally spaced out. Therefore through this project  we will be collecting glycan data at higher resolution, through testing the cohort every 2 months and thereby being able to detect changes that improve the algorithm and make it more sensitive to changes in (peri)menopause. \n\n# Reviews\n\n# Highlights\n- Very Strong Team of Scientists, Clinicians and Entrepreneurs\n- MenoAge diagnostic test already developed \n- Produces revenue in the near-term, and  GlycanAge system can be leveraged for MenoAge\n- Large and growing Market with an unmet need, and Early market entry possible\n- First encouraging data in humans\n- The proposed MenoAge test has the potential to determine long-term average concentrations of sex hormones, which would be a substantial improvement over available test systems focusing primarily on short-lived hormones. This is in analogy to glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) used as biomarker to determine long-term concentrations of blood glucose.\n\n# Risks\n- testing of product still in pre-clinical phase\n- focus seems to be on UK and potential other countries, so far no plans for EU \n\n\n# Longevity WG scientific evaluation digest:\n\n3/3 senior reviewers have expressed a **vote in support** of **funding** this proposal.\nHere is the digest:\n\n**Quantitative reviews:**\n\n> To quantify the level of conviction, they have provided a score on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being the highest).\n> The average score was **3.92/5**\n\n**Brief qualitative review summaries:**\n\nSenior Reviewer 1.) Highly relevant for longevity, as the proposed MenoAge test can monitor and optimize hormonal treatment of perimenopause women, which will lead to a healthier lifespan and potentially even longer life span in an aging female population.I recommend funding of this project by VitaDao. The proposed deal terms below, i.e. 250K for 2% on MenoAge revenue up to a 6x return, are considered reasonable. \n\nSenior Reviewer 2.)  This is an unmet need in the market and has the potential to enable earlier diagnosis and treatment of menopause / perimenopause. Earlier treatment may reduce the pace of aging and lift the burden on healthcare systems. Knowledge is power! And the team is quite strong. \n\nSenior Reviewer 3.) There is a crucial need for perimenopause diagnostics. Early detection is pivotal so women can receive the personalized treatment they need to decrease the risk of severe health and psychological consequences that can result from menopause. IgG glycans may be the first reliable biomarker of perimenopause onset, which has the potential to help women around the globe start hormone replacement therapy earlier, thus improving their healthspan.\n\n# Implementation\n\n**Success Metrics:**\n\nPatients need to be enrolled and samples collected consistently with timeline described below. When the samples’ glycome is analysed, the result would be compared to clinician reports, questionnaires, and patients’ symptoms to see how well they match. This is both in the case for perimenopause-menopause transition, as well as HRT start and patients’ response to it. If results are promising, the product will generate revenue quickly, starting to sell in private clinics and later on direct to consumers.\n\n**Timeline:**\n\nFollowing all applicable ethical guidelines, and aiming at ethnic and socio-demographic variability, we will recruit 100 perimenopausal women from among the waiting list of Newson Health Menopause and Wellbeing Clinic – and follow them up for up to 2 years from the initial visit. Each patient will complete at least 3 assessment visits at 6-12 months intervals. Patients will complete a menopause symptom questionnaire and a quality-of-life questionnaire at each visit. Hormone blood tests (oestradiol, testosterone, and SHBG levels) will be undertaken as clinically indicated. They will be given appropriate hormone replacement therapy, which will include oestradiol, according to their symptoms and health. Their management of perimenopause will be according to the national and international guidance on the management of perimenopause and menopause. The types of hormonal replacement therapy administered will be in line with guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), according to each women’s clinical needs. Dried blood spots will be collected every month for IgG glycosylation analysis: at each visit and, additionally at home by self-test kits. \n\n**Budget:**\n\nClinicians **$100,000**\nProject team **$50,000**\n800 IgG glycome analysis: sets (at $7), profiling analysis (at $60 subsidized price). Hormones biochemical blood tests (at $60) blood collection (at $30) **$90,000***\nShipping costs, Other costs, Overhead **$10,000**\n\n**Total: $250,000**\n\n# Commercialisation\nMenoAge will be Partnering with Intervenn, the first Glycan based ovarian cancer detection test on market - approved as a diagnostic which is generally hard to do independently . Intervenn raised $200M USD and MenoAge plans a joint venture with them and put the MenoAge test through their already established certified regulatory system to get it to a fully certified and approved as traditional diagnostic.\n\nhttps://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/intervenn-biosciences-quintuples-funding-201m-for-ai-powered-cancer-tests\n\n# Funding Terms\n$250K for a share of 2% of Revenue up to 6x return - in form of a Royalty NFT(facilitated by Molecule).\n\n# Supporting Documents\nApplication form: https://airtable.com/appqo3bPXVQojAtrk/tblE6sjpeUO9vMFRR/viwZNKkwspMtXXN42/rec5sbI80h6na2Fas?blocks=bipf1A1U1w3J7pxR5\n\nMenoAge Community Call with Nikolina Lauc and Dr. Louise Newson:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KH2qRMm-QY0\n",

      "content": "**One-liner**: Assessment of [Repair Biotechnologies](https://www.repairbiotechnologies.com/), a preclinical-stage biotech company developing a first-in-class universal cell therapy for atherosclerosis.\n\n*This proposal is based on the supporting documents provided by Repair Bio, as well as questions and answers to their team, and senior reviews.*\n*The VITA token holders can ratify the Longevity-Dealflow WG’s assessment via a decentralized vote*\n\n# Longevity Dealflow WG team\n\n**Scientific and business evaluation**: Diane Seimetz, Sebastian Brunemeier, Tuan Dinh, Eli Mo, Paolo Binetti, Anonymous Professor\n\n**Shepherd**: Laurence Ion\n\n**Other squad members**: Eli Mo, Paolo Binetti\n\n# Simple Summary\n\n**Repair Biotechnologies is developing a new atherosclerosis therapy that could reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, improving on current drugs.** \n\nTheir patented technology modifies cells to safely break down excess cholesterol and can be delivered as a gene therapy or cell therapy. The present focus is on the development of a\nuniversal cell therapy with enhanced macrophages derived from induced pluripotent stem cells and engineered to express a protein capable of degrading excess cholesterol. First tests in cell lines and mice were encouraging. With cardiovascular diseases as the worldwide leading cause of death (27% of all global deaths), the market potential is significant. The company is already supported by a number of investors, including venture capital firms. The current raise aims at finalizing the candidate therapy and getting approval for phase 1/2 clinical trials.\n\n\n\n\n# Problem\n\n**Atherosclerosis is the main cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD), an age-related disease ranking as the number 1 killer in the world**, responsible for a quarter of all deaths according to recent World Health Organization data**.**\n\nIn atherosclerosis, plaques that are mainly made up of cholesterol build up over time in the walls of arteries, restricting or even blocking the flow of oxygen-rich blood to organs and other parts of the body.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://QmVidUQPC25gNZ1NyfjseEJppBYeEY9pJdae7TuKeSco6b)\n\n\nAtherosclerosis can occur in arteries anywhere in the body but is most serious when affecting the heart or the brain. If it occurs in one of the two main coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart, it results in a heart attack. In the brain, it can cause a stroke.\n\nIn arteries, cholesterol is carried by low-density lipoproteins or LDLs. Some of this ends up in artery walls. In young individuals, macrophages, a type of immune cell, help clear excess\nLDL-delivered cholesterol from artery walls by ingesting it and then attaching it to smaller\nhigh-density lipoproteins, or HDL, which return to the liver for excretion. Unfortunately, **with\naging, macrophages become overwhelmed by excessive localized deposits of cholesterol for a variety of reasons.**\n\nTo date, no therapy can reduce plaque size. Current medical treatments for atherosclerosis, like statins, which are inhibitors of cholesterol production, can only slow its accumulation in plaques. **Statins do reduce cardiovascular events by about 25%, which is already a huge achievement, but do not cure atherosclerosis.**\n\n\n# Solution\n\n**Repair Bio aims to solve macrophage dysfunction with their “Cholesterol-Degrading Platform” (CDP), a novel allogeneic cell therapy**. Concretely, the idea is to produce macrophage cells engineered to have better LDL disposal capabilities and deliver them to patients.\n\nRepair manufactures these enhanced macrophages in a series of steps (see figure below):\n\n\n\n1. First they obtain induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC, a cell that can be converted into any other type of cell) from healthy donors\n2. Then they modify these cells so that they are not recognized and attacked as foreign by patients’ immune systems, in other words, they make them universal\n3. At this point they add proprietary genetic instructions for the cells to produce an LDL-degrading protein in a tightly controlled way, to avoid tampering with the cholesterol normally required by cell membranes\n4. Finally they convert the cells into macrophages\n\n \n![image](ipfs://QmVcDxXa9Kx6Df4ep3dEiG4Fe7LYmMGjD9KNvhPyP6SzXx)\n\n\n---\nIn-vitro tests of these enhanced macrophages have shown that they can break down excess ingested cholesterol into safe catabolites. **Encouraging results were also obtained in vivo in a strain of mice used for studying cardiovascular disease**: in this proof of concept (POC) study, mice on a high-fat diet were treated with a gene therapy implementation of Repair’s approach. The treated mice exhibited a rapid halving of atherosclerotic plaque lipids, an outcome needing only a one-month period following a single treatment, with no identified side effects.\n\nThe next steps are:\n\n* End 2023: out of preclinical studies\n* Mid 2024: clinical studies start (IND enabling)\n* Beginning 2024: GMP manufacturing\n* End 2024: phase 1/2a\n\n\n# Opportunity\n\n**The atherosclerosis subpopulation market is worth about 20 B$**. However, initially, Repair will address the smaller market of familial hypercholesterolemia, an orphan indication with an easier approval process.\n\nBecause Repair’s therapy is based on universal cells, it should be relatively cheap, of the order of 10 k$, thus ensuring accessibility by a large number of people.\n\nA startup developing a comparable therapy, Verve Therapeutics, was acquired for 1.5bn.\n\nFinally, it has to be noted that Repair’s platform to enhance macrophages could also be applied to other cell types to address different indications.\n\n\n# Intellectual Property\n\n\n\n* **Exclusive license of core technology patent** from the University of Alabama covering Repair cholesterol-degrading mechanisms in cells (No cash milestones, 2% royalty)\n* Patent filed for use of cofactors/modifiers\n* Patent in progress for use of repair technology to treat hypercholesterolemias\n\n\n# Team\n\n**Executive team**\n\n\n\n* **Reason, CEO and cofounder**: active angel investor in the longevity industry since its earliest days, he is also the founder and writer of Fight Aging!, a noted news and commentary website\n* Mourad Topors, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer: experienced manager in translational medical research with a focus in cardiovascular disease.

Here is the digest:\n\n**Quantitative reviews:**\n\n> To quantify the level of conviction, they have provided a score on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being the highest).\n\n> The average score was **3.75/5**\n\n**Brief qualitative review summaries:**\n\n> ### 1) \n> Macrophage engineering is very exciting, and atherosclerosis is the leading cause of death. I've known the management team for a few years and they are strongly aligned to the longevity mission. \n\n> ### 2)\n> Compared to approved atherosclerosis products Repair Bio’s macrophages have the potential to breakdown cholesterol in macrophages and thereby ameliorate the fundamental cause of atherosclerosis rather than lowering the cholesterol content and slowing of plaque build-up. \n> Furthermore, a synergistic effect may be achieved by the M2 phenotype of the macrophages which is known for anti-inflammatory and regenerative properties. \nAvailable in vitro and in vivo data, albeit limited, support the mechanism of action of the concept with the caveat that the final cell-based product was not used, nor was a comparison to approved products performed. \n>\n>With the experienced team and the potential to make an important difference in the field of longevity, I support this project.\n\n> ### 3)\n> Highlights:\n> Published data seems to show strong effects\n> They have a strong executive team with a lot of drug development experience for CVD\n> They are open to licensing deals\n> The macrophage engineering approach can be applied to the broader longevity space\n> The first indication of familial hypercholesterolemias makes sense as data demonstrates that statins and other cholesterol lowering drugs are less effective for this group\n> The inventor has strong credibility in the AS/macrophage field\n>\n> Risks:\n> Very cutting edge - not much is known about safety and FDA approval risk\n> Only ApoE mouse model data is available - Would love to see more data\n> Manufacturing of cells is expensive - could lead to tens of thousand dollars for therapies -> much more expensive to generic statins\n> No discussion on how the macrophages will be delivered to the site of action.\n> Very high valuation for limited data\n>\n> Overall:\n> Rather high risk but maybe a sweet spot for VitaDAO \n\n> ### 4)\n> Overall:  I like the idea, think the cell therapy approach is novel and distinct (particularly from what we have in the DAO pipeline), and see an obvious path to IP.  While there is strong POC for the gene platform, the lack of POC for the cell therapy approach in animals is a limitation.  Given that the hurdle to clinical trials and proving efficacy is quite challenging, the project is obviously one of those high risk - high reward things.  Finally, I like the team, as they seem thoughtful and committed to the approach and tackling this important health issue.\n\n# Vote:\n\nHere, you, the VITA token holders, are voting to agree or disagree with the Longevity-Dealflow WG’s assessment of this company.\n",

      "title": "VDP-45 [Governance] Decentralized Tech Transfer (DTT)",
      "content": "This proposal asks for bounty payments in VITA tokens to create a decentralised tech transfer network that connects VitaDAO directly to researchers.\n\n# Problem\n Tech transfer offices (TTOs) at universities are a major bottleneck in funding projects.\n\n# Solution\n\n Decentralised Tech Transfer (DTT).\n\nIn brief, the idea is:\n\n1. Identify researchers with a project.\n2. Pay the selected researchers as consultants on the project.\n3. Use contract research organizations (CROs) and core facilities at universities with which the researcher isn’t affiliated to execute the project and generate the intellectual property (IP). This IP will be owned by those who fund the project and the researchers.\n4. Anyone could get upside in the project by helping incubate it.\n\n*Analogy:* Rather than Airbnb negotiating with hotel owners for their unused rooms or Uber negotiating with taxi companies on their unused cars, these Web2 companies disintermediated them by going straight to the people. Similarly, rather than negotiating with universities, VitaDAO should go straight to the researchers.\n\n*VitaDAO-specific details:* The above is a general concept that could be used in any DeSci context. The following details pertain to VitaDAO specifically:\n\n1. The project aligns with VitaDAO’s mission of promoting longevity.\n2. The IP will be owned by VitaDAO and the researchers, via a RWE (real world entity) holding company.\n3. “Anyone” getting upside would likely refer to members of the VitaDAO community.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n1. Greater efficiency. No more waiting on universities and their tech transfer offices (TTOs). All negotiations are directly between the researcher(s) and VitaDAO.\n2. The researcher(s) are in full control of their upside. The effort they put in determines their resulting equity/IP stake. They also receive regular consulting fees for the work they put in.\n3. VitaDAO’s funds will be spent more judiciously. It only pays for IP generating experiments and the hours of work the researcher(s) put in. This also allows for better treasury management because VitaDAO's funds stay longer under its control, e.g., in yield generating accounts, e.g., DeFi, rather than sitting in a university's bank account not earning interest.\n4. DTT better focuses VitaDAO on entrepreneurially minded researchers, who are well suited to cross the valley of death and who are aligned with other entrepreneur-centered efforts in the space e.g., YCombinator, Nucleate, NewScience, SPARK, etc.\n5. Growing DAO2DAO coordination and the DeSci movement. In coordination with DeSci partners such as LabDAO, partners will be selected to provide services for the projects. Partners can be companies, CROs or universities with which the researchers aren’t affiliated.\n\n*Long-term:* This will make VitaDAO more automated and less hampered by university bureaucracy. Regarding automation, we can imagine self-serve website experiences where all the following activities are possible:\n\n1. Researchers post their project\n2. Qualified people review the project in exchange for VITA tokens\n3. On-chain voting to fund or not the project happens once the project accumulates enough reviews\n\n# Specification\n\n**Researcher network:** This VDP proposes that VitaDAO, in partnership with other researcher networks, will source researchers that are willing and able to lead projects in this DTT model. It's understood that some researcher's employers may prevent them from participating in IP generation outside of their employment. Partnering researcher networks are still TBD. \n\n**CRO network:** This VDP proposes that VitaDAO, in partnership with LabDAO, will orchestrate a CRO network for researchers to tap into to do the IP-generating experiments. To pilot this initiative, VitaDAO will take the lead in establishing a Master Agreement with Washington University in St. Louis’ Center for Drug Discovery, which has both medicinal chemistry and high-throughput screening capabilities.\n\nThe details of the relationship, e.g., financial terms, between VitaDAO and LabDAO will be the subject of a future VDP. It should be understood though that because this CRO network can be used by more than just VitaDAO, VitaDAO should receive $LAB tokens in exchange for funding its development.\n\n*Team:* @timrpeterson @SB23 @NiklasTR @tylergolato @longevion @Tovah @Taliskermalt @lutz. Those interested in helping please contact us.\n\n*Success Metrics:* Establish diverse services both wet-lab and computational (> 10). Sign partnerships with well-established institutions that in addition to providing good science will ideally lead to discounted services and co-branding opportunities.\n\n*Timeline:* Six months. June 2022-January 2023. \n\n*Budget:* Bounty payments in the form of $VITA tokens will be given to those who contribute to building the researcher and CRO networks.",

      "title": "VDP-40 [Funding] Cellular ‘Soap’ For Infectious Disease Accelerated Aging - Dr Tim Peterson",
      "content": "**One-liner** : Proposal to allocate $231,000 to Tim Peterson's project developing a cellular \"soap\" (sphingolipid mimetics) to thwart pathogens and senescent cells.\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG team\n\n**Scientific evaluation**: Sebastian Brunemeier, Diane Seimetz, Anonymous reviewer (professor)\n**Business evaluation**: Sebastian Brunemeier, Diane Seimetz\n**Shepherd**: Laurence Ion\n**Other squad members**: Tuan Dinh\n**Sourced by**: Tim Peterson\n\n**Project PI**: Dr. Tim Peterson\n\n\n# Simple Summary\n\nPrevention of communicable disease via hygiene, antibiotics, vaccines, amongst other innovations has provided the largest life expectancy gains in human history. It is increasingly appreciated that pathogens age humans by driving their cell senescence. The team led by Dr. Tim Peterson has identified chemistry that acts as a cellular ‘soap’ to concomitantly thwart pathogens and senescent cells. What’s exciting about the invention is that, as with the aforementioned innovations, it not only appears to be a generalizable strategy against many pathogens but also many aging pathologies.\n\n# Problem\n\nThe relationship between infectious disease and aging is increasingly appreciated. Perhaps most well-known now is that advancing age predicts a worse COVID19 prognosis. However, the relationship is not just correlative – several common pathogens have been implicated as causal mechanisms in models of aging-related disease. For example, with Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Alzheimer’s disease, and the periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis and cardiovascular disease. In most cases, there are neither prophylactics nor therapies to combat these common pathogens and thus to prevent the lifespan-limiting effects they have.\n\n# Opportunity\n\nSenolytics have emerged as an intriguing new therapeutic paradigm for aging-related disease. Senolytics selectively kill pathogenic senescent cells compared with healthy proliferating cells, but it is unclear what their molecular target is that provides this selectivity. Without this rationale, it has been hard to make progress in identifying new senolytics.\n\nThrough combined deep learning and genome-wide screening, Dr. Peterson has identified chemical features present in several FDA-approved drugs that provide this long-sought-after rationale. Considering that pathogens render healthy cells senescent, this approach has the potential to “kill two birds with one stone” in thwarting both pathogens and senescent cells.\n\nThe objective of the project is to conduct a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments to design new drugs that perform against a wide range of senescence inducers.\n\nMoreover, there is a clear path to iterate on the chemistry to:\n\n1. Increase drug potency several-fold.\n2. Eliminate the original use of the drug (i.e., reducing unwanted effects) without affecting its anti-pathogen or senolytic activity.\n3. Increase the list of patentable compounds from 5 to 100s, providing plentiful patenting opportunities.\n4. Use structure / function relationships to design novel scaffolds and compounds with senolytic effects.\n\n# Experimental plan\n\n### Stage  1: IP generation - In vitro screening:\n\nNovel compositions of matter that will be the basis of the IP-NFT will be tested in multiple cell types using multiple senescence inducers, both pathogen and more classic (DNA damage). These experiments will tell us how broadly vs. context-dependent our drug candidates are. The primary readout will be the well-accepted senescence measures.\n\n### Stage 2: IP validation - In vivo validation:\n\nLead compounds will be tested using a mouse model. The mouse model is commonly used in the senescence field and is a well-accepted experimental paradigm. In addition to lifespan, behavioral and neurological scoring (e.g., paralysis), as well as blood and CSF biomarkers, will be assessed.\n\n# IP Roadmap\n\nThe project will generate new compounds, which will provide opportunities for IP-NFT value creation.\n\nThe IP strategy is extensively mapped out. Therefore, the applicants will be able to begin drafting the provisional patent application promptly upon funding. Intellectual property will focus on novel compositions of matter as that will be the most valuable to future investors.\n\n# Team\n\n**Dr. Tim Peterson, Ph.D., CEO BIOIO, Assistant Professor Washington University School of Medicine**\nhttps://petersonlab.wustl.edu\n\nDr. Peterson is an MIT- and Harvard-trained faculty member at Washington University in St. Louis (a.k.a. WashU or WUSTL) School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM is a perennially top-five US institution in terms of research funding and publishing and is tied to 19 Nobel Prize winners since its founding in 1909. Over his 15-year research career, Dr. Peterson has published in Nature, Science, and Cell and their affiliated journals and has received grant funding from the NIH, American Diabetes Association, the Nathan Shock Aging Center, Amazon Web Services amongst others. Dr. Peterson’s focus on longevity started with his PhD at MIT. At MIT, he made multiple seminal discoveries on rapamycin and the pathway it targets the mTOR pathway. Rapamycin and mTOR are arguably the most widely validated longevity therapy and pathway, respectively. At Harvard, Dr. Peterson trained under Erin O’Shea, PhD who now leads HHMI. There Dr. Peterson focused on longevity drug mechanisms, e.g., on the osteoporosis drug bisphosphonates and the diabetes drug metformin, which he has since carried with him into his academic lab and companies. In addition to his role at WashU and BIOIO, Dr. Peterson is a co-founder of Healthspan Technologies, which is developing mRNA lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based therapeutics with a focus on vaccines for aging-accelerating infectious agents. Prior to his professional career, Dr. Peterson trained with the US Rowing Team from 1999-to 2001.\n\n\n> ### Potential conflict of interest ⚠️\n> \n> The PI of this project, Tim Peterson is also a Steward of the Longevity Dealflow Working Group. \n> \n> Laurence Ion, the shepherd of this deal is also a Steward.\n> \n> The evaluation process at VitaDAO is designed to be transparent, as unbiased as possible, giving the community ample time to review, with unhindered access to confidential information that the applicant is comfortable sharing, and an **independent board of 3-5 Senior Reviewers** that have expertise and the community's trust, with their **conviction level and summary reviews carrying weight in the decision of the tokenholders**.\n\n**Prof. Roland (Ron) Dolle, Ph.D., Director of Center of Drug Discovery**\nhttps://cdd.wustl.edu\n\nDr. Dolle is an Associate Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics. Having spent 20 years in industry before coming to WashU, Ron’s expertise includes medicinal chemistry and many aspects of drug design and preclinical development. His accomplishments include the advancement of more than a dozen drug candidates into preclinical and clinical studies including at least 7 investigational new drug (IND) applications.\n\n# Budget\n\n*Stage 1: 6 months (IP generation)*\n```\nMedicinal chemistry: $40,000\nIn vitro screening:  $20,000\nPatent filing:       $20,000\nSalaries:            $20,000\nOverhead (10%):      $10,000\n\nSubtotal:            $110,000 \n``` \n\n*Stage 2: 12 months (IP validation)*\n\n```\nIn vivo validation:  $70,000\nSalaries:            $40,000\nOverhead (10%):      $11,000\n\nSubtotal:            $121,000\n\n\nTotal:               $231,000 \n```\n\n# Strengths\n\n* Senescence plays an important role in the aging process. Targeting senescence makes sense.\n* The approach targets both pathogens and aging - linking between pathogens and aging is understudied\n* The project team has strong credentials, led by Dr. Tim Peterson. Dr. Peterson brings expertise in aging sciences, and Dr. Ron Dolle is a medicinal chemist who will handle hit/lead optimizations.\n* Early data using existing drugs demonstrates that the mechanism of action (MOA) works as expected (not for public disclosure at this point), which supports further research\n* The lab has experience with senescence. Also, the project will be supported by an expert in the field of senolytics.\n\n# Risks\n\n* The MOA is novel and not tested outside of Dr. Tim Peterson’s group\n* Only initial in vitro data available, unclear how the drugs would work in vivo\n* New compounds will be produced - whose PKPD and safety profiles are unknown\n\n# Longevity WG scientific evaluation digest: \n\nThe 3 senior reviewers have expressed a vote in agreement to fund this proposal and are ready to give a final digest:\n \n**Quantitative reviews:**\n>To quantify the level of conviction, they have provided a score on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being the highest). \nThe average score was **3.35/5**\n \n**Brief qualitative review summaries:**\n>### 1) \n> There are some aspects to the project that are not clear-cut. The ALS model is one of them. I also think the budget is a bit low for doing any kind of med chem (*comment from shepherd: the applicant answered that they'll cover the rest with their funds*). The preliminary hit compounds are promising though, but it's still early. That said, we know Tim is a good PI and is mission-aligned, so he will likely put the funds to good use. \n>### 2) \n> The cellular \"soap\" proposal aims to investigate the senolytic properties of FDA approved drugs with cationic amphiphilic properties (CAD) in different cell-based systems (aim 1), and determine the aging-accelerating effects of a common pathogen and the protective effects of CADs against it (aim 2). During the review process it was clarified that the project is not a re-purposing project. Instead, based on the scientific findings, the aim is to generate novel composition of matter with the requested funds from VitaDAO. Therefore, the main concern has been addressed and I would support funding of the project.\n>### 3) \n> Things I like:\n> * Promising preliminary data with priority compounds (see prior comments)\n> * Sound medicinal chemistry plan with appropriate expertise (again, assuming the specifics can be flushed out)\n> * Strong cell biology experimental plan, with a good range of diversity built in\n> * Clear relevance to the mission of the DAO\n >\n> Things I don’t like:\n> * Preclinical ALS animal model.  There is just too much hand waving here for me to be assured of a clear result.  I think if we are going to pay for the in vivo experiments, we need to believe they will generate a definitive conclusion (works or doesn’t).  I’m not sure the ALS model does that.  See specifics in previous comments.  But perhaps that deserves further discussion after phase I (medicinal chemistry and cell testing) has been completed.\n I certainly think the project here rates similarly to many others we have considered and funded.\n\nFor more information, please see the [phase 2 proposal and discussion on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-40-cellular-soap-for-infectious-disease-accelerated-aging-dr-tim-peterson/590).",

      "content": "This proposal asks for 50,000 USD to contribute to a 4 year doctoral research program probing DNA quadruplexes in age-related proteostasis.\n\n# Summary\nWe are proposing to contribute $50,000 USD to a 4 year doctoral research program at the Institute of Chemical Biology, Imperial College London. This doctoral research will aim to establish the role of DNA Helicases (WRN and BLM) as positive regulators of proteostasis and understand their impact of declining function prior to the onset of age-related proteostasis. Furthermore, the project will aim to develop genetic and pharmacological tools to modify DNA helicase activity, that may form the basis of intellectual property and therapeutics. In exchange for supporting this doctoral program, VitaDAO expects to have access to IP licensing rights (potentially related to therapeutic compounds or biologics) derived from the research program via an IP-NFT via Molecule.\n\n**Agree**: Support the VDP and permit VitaDAO to pursue IP-NFT agreements and transfer funds to the investigators once in place.\n\n**Disagree**: Do not support the VDP and further action under this VDP.\n\n\n\n\n# Details\n\nProject PI: [Marco di Antonio, Imperial College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/diantonio-research-group/) and [John Labbadia, UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/people/dr-john-labbadia)\n\n## Problem\n\n​​The ability to generate and maintain an optimal proteome is of paramount importance for long-term health. As such, cells have evolved a highly conserved network of protein quality control pathways, commonly referred to as the Protein homeostasis (Proteostasis) Network (PN), that operates across cells to neutralize the threat of misfolded, mislocalized and aggregated proteins throughout life. Despite this, the accumulation and persistence of aberrant protein species (known as a loss of proteostasis) is a common feature of aging in worms, flies, mice and humans, and is associated with the dysfunction of multiple tissues in aged individuals.\n\nThese observations raise the possibility that maintaining proteostasis throughout life may be a powerful way to promote healthy aging; however, the cause of age-related proteostasis collapse remains poorly understood. A comprehensive interrogation of the relationship between PN activity, proteostasis capacity and aging in Caenorhabditis elegans, has revealed that the capacity of the PN declines in early adulthood due to the transcriptional repression of multiple PN components. Recently, the Di Antonio and Labbadia groups (of this proposal) have discovered that the DNA helicases, WRN-1/WRN and HIM-6/BLM, are required for the maintenance of proteostasis capacity in adulthood, suggesting that genome integrity early in life is intimately coupled with the propensity for proteostasis collapse with age.\n\nIn this project the investigators will explore the hypothesis that WRN-1 and HIM-6 activity positively regulate proteostasis capacity by preventing the inappropriate persistence of DNA G-quadruplex (G4) structures at the promoters of PN genes, and that the loss of DNA helicase activity and G4 homeostasis early in life underlies the repression of PN genes and proteostasis collapse with age. This will re-shape our understanding of the origins of age-related proteostasis collapse and highlight new mechanisms and pathways that can be targeted to preserve proteome integrity and prolong healthy tissue function.\n\n## Opportunity\n\nThis project provides VitaDAO an opportunity to contribute to developing novel science around the role of G4 structures in healthy and unhealthy aging. Particularly of unique interest is the probing of both the wanted and unwanted G4 structures and their impact on proteostasis maintenance, which may create the opportunity for novel drug targets. The project specifically highlights the intent to produce a library of ligands and biological tools (possibly CRISPR, mRNA etc.) to perturb G4 structures which could form the basis of intellectual property around mechanism of action and molecular entities.\n\nThe research plan outlines the production of G4 stabilizing and disrupting tools (ligands etc.) and measuring the impact of these within physiological conditions across multiple organisms including C. elegans and human cell lines.\n\nFor a $50,000 USD “Top Up” contribution to the doctoral program, VitaDAO will be supporting the doctoral research student for 4 years within the Institute of Chemical Biology, Imperial College London and University College London, between the research groups of Marco Di Antonio and John Labbadia. Over the course of the 4 year program the doctoral researcher will be pursuing the research proposal provided below in this VDP.\n\nAs part of the program the researcher will be supported to work with VitaDAO (in the role as the industrial partner from the Longevity field) as part of their professional development which could take the form of research within the lab of another VitaDAO project performer or exposure of more commercial aspects of Longevity life science.\n\nAs part of Imperial College's research agreement, Imperial College would grant VitaDAO the option to take  exclusive or non-exclusive license to the intellectual property rights, with additional good-faith negotiation once the option is exercised. The terms have been reviewed by Molecule and deemed to be sufficient for the current state of the research program.\n\n\n## Highlights\n\n* Opportunity to identify novel therapeutic targets relevant to longevity research, based on a molecular scaffold already identified by the investigators\n* Opportunity to contribute novel research to the field on the role of DNA helicases and G4 structures related to age related diseases\n* Opportunity for partially fund a PhD thesis via VitaDAO\n* Opportunity for a member of VitaDAO to co-supervise the doctoral student throughout the 4 year program\n* UCL and Imperial College London are highly entrepreneurial institutions and will provide support to the investigators in steering the project through commercial or IP generating activities when appropriate\n\n## Risks\n\n* Doctoral research projects can be quite risky and are sometimes far away from filing IP, however this work is not completely green field and there is already published work this project extends\n* Whilst our colleagues are familiar managing relationships with technology transfer offices there is always some risk, that an agreement cannot be reached regarding representing IP as an on chain IP-NFT\n\n# Reviews from the Longevity Working Group\n\n**Outcome of the evaluation and recommendation** \n\nOf all the evaluators, 3 independently scored the project proposal on different categories as either:\n*(1) Outstanding, (2) Strong, (3) Satisfactory, (4) Weak, (5) Unacceptable, (N/A) Not enough information provided, or (N/A) Not my area of expertise.* \n\nThis is a summary of the results: \n* Novelty and Impact:\n-- (2) Strong (3/3 evaluators) \n* Feasibility and Data:\n-- (2) Strong  (3/3 evaluators) \n* Relevance to longevity:\n-- (2) Strong (3/3 evaluators) \n* Science Team: \n-- (2) Strong (3/3 evaluators) \n* Market Advantage:\n-- (N/A) Not area of expertise (1/1 evaluators)\n-- (4) Weak (2/2 evaluators)\n* IP-NFT Potential: \n-- (N/A) Not enough information (1/1 evaluators)\n-- (3) Satisfactory (2/2 evaluators)\n\nFor more information, please see [the phase 2 proposal and discussion on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-22-probing-dna-quadruplexes-in-age-related-proteostasis/516).

      "title": "VDP38 [Funding] ApoptoSENS - Senolytic CAR-NK cells ",
      "content": "**One-liner**: This proposal asks for 253,000 USD to fund [SENS Research Foundation](https://sens.org)'s ApoptoSENS project to develop CAR-NK cells to precisely and safely eliminate senescent cells.\n\n## Longevity Dealflow WG team\n**Scientific evaluation** : Sebastian Brunemeier, Tim Peterson, anonymous reviewer (professor), anonymous reviewer (industry professional), Jason Colasanti, Aaron King\n**Business evaluation** : Sebastian Brunemeier, Tim Peterson and anonymous reviewer (professor), anonymous reviewer (industry professional)\n**Shepherd** : Laurence Ion\n**Other squad members** : Jason Colasanti, Tuan Dinh, Ines Simo\n**Sourced by** : Laurence Ion\n\n**Project PI** : Dr. Amit Sharma\n\n# Simple Summary\nOver time, a subset of cells throughout the body experience damage and enter a state of senescence. Cellular senescence is the irreversible arrest of proliferation, and senescent cells secrete proinflammatory factors that lead to tissue dysfunction. Selective elimination of these senescent cells has been shown to ameliorate hallmarks of aging in both mice and humans. However, current methods to eliminate senescent cells are non-specific and may have off-target effects. As a result, Amit Sharma’s team is developing Chimeric Antigen Receptor Natural Killer (CAR-NK) cells to precisely and safely eliminate senescent cells in vivo.\n\n# Problem\nWhen cells become damaged, they may enter a state of cellular senescence where they no longer function properly and secrete proinflammatory factors. The immune system’s ability to eliminate senescent cells diminishes with age, resulting in their accumulation throughout the body. This accumulation leads to dysfunction in many different tissue types and accelerates aging. Current approaches to eliminate senescent cells are non-specific and their mechanisms of action are largely unknown. Also, due to the highly heterogeneous nature of senescent cells, including the existence of senescent cells with beneficial effects, there is currently a lack of knowledge regarding cell surface markers to identify populations of harmful senescent cells.\n\n# Opportunity\n\nThe current focus on senescence as a therapeutic target was prompted by the discoveries that markers of cellular senescence accumulate with aging and accumulation is delayed by interventions that increase healthspan and lifespan, removal of senescent cells increases healthspan in progeroid mouse models, and transplantation of a relatively small number of senescent cells into previously healthy animals provokes multisystem dysfunction similar to what is seen in aged animals.  Furthermore, it has been shown that the correlation of senescent cell accumulation with disease extends to humans. Since senescent cells are highly heterogeneous in both their molecular biology and their physiological function, targeted strategies are needed that ideally preserve senescent cells in beneficial contexts while eliminating effects that are detrimental.\n\nBroadly speaking, current therapies can be broken down into the major categories of senomorphic (targeting SASP, i.e., senescence-associated secretory phenotype, components) and senolytic (targeting senescent cells) drugs. While the first senolytics were developed using a bioinformatically informed approach aimed at disrupting SCAPs and other pro-survival networks, the class has expanded to take advantage of additional senescence features and enhance immune-mediated clearance. Most notably, characterization of senescent cells has revealed unique markers that serve as senescence-associated self-antigens, and these can be co-opted for immune system-mediated senolytic activity and clearance. \n\nA recent study took advantage of this approach using chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeted against the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) in a mouse model (doi: 10.1038/s41586-020-2403-9). Cytotoxic CAR T cells were able to selectively clear uPAR-expressing senescent cells in vitro and in vivo. CAR T cell-mediated clearance of senescent cells led to survival and histopathologic benefit in murine models of both carbon tetrachloride- and diet-induced liver fibrosis, suggesting the feasibility and potential of this clearance strategy. However, supratherapeutic CAR T cell dosing is associated with a proinflammatory cytokine profile, weight loss and hypothermia, suggesting that careful attention would need to be paid to initial dosing strategies, particularly in geriatric populations where a compromised immune system together with ongoing chronic inflammation may restrict the therapeutic window. Additionally, CAR T cell approaches in humans involve initial immune system suppression with considerable attendant morbidity and are expensive. Although senolytic CAR T cells appear to be self-limiting, their expansion and contraction occurs over a period of days, which is a risk in the case of an acute to subacute adverse reaction. Overall, this strategy is highly promising given its preclinical efficacy and senescent cell specificity, but future optimization and testing is necessary before clinical administration.\n\nSee review here:  https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00121-8 \n\nDespite the pre-clinical promises of targeting senescent cells and/or SASP, clinical trials in humans thus far have been less encouraging.  Nevertheless, significant interest remains in the general approach. \n\nGiven the success of CAR T cells (see example above), particularly in the cancer field, the team here has identified unique surface markers on senescent cells for targeted removal.\n\nUsing a commercially available protocol, the investigators have found several cell surface markers of IMR-90 cells made senescent by ionizing radiation or doxorubicin treatments that are not present on healthy cells.  To date, they have focused on 5 top candidates, of which SENS-1, -2 and -3 have been further vetted, with SENS-3 perhaps looking the most promising (data of Figure 3).  In the proposal here, priority senescent cell markers will be more extensively validated using additional cell model paradigms (stressors), as well as in mouse models (cross-species validation).  Validated surface markers will be used to generate monoclonal antibodies, which will then be confirmed for specificity against the target antigen.  Appropriate CAR NK cells will be created to further establish proof of concept for their approach of selective removal of senescent cells in their various model systems.\n\n\n# Intellectual Property\n\nA patent regarding methods to develop the CAR-NK cells is intended to be filed. They already have filed patents for specific surface-marker antibodies and subsequent reagents that allow selective targeting of senescent cells.\n\n# Team\n**Dr. Amit Sharma**: Project Lead at SENS Research Foundation, PhD in Biotechnology (https://www.linkedin.com/in/amit-sharma-1613b189/)\n\nDr. Amit Sharma was awarded a Master’s degree in Biomedical Sciences from Delhi University, India.  He received his PhD in 2009 in Biotechnology from University of Pune for his work demonstrating microRNA regulation of cytokines involved in allergic inflammation in mouse models. Dr. Sharma’s postdoctoral research at the Buck Institute, Novato, California involved investigating novel molecular regulatory pathways in regards to genotoxic stress and cellular senescence in invertebrate and mammalian models.\n\nDr. Sharma has joined SENS Research Foundation as Group Lead in the Senescence Immunology Research Group (“ImmunoSENS”). His research focus involves studying how aging and senescence affects the immune system and his research group will also investigate strategies to harness the immune system in mitigating deleterious effects of senescent cells with translational focus.\n\n\n# Budget\nThey are requesting the following budget each year, for a total of two years.

(i.e. killing 40-50% senescent cells and 10-25% healthy cells)\n- p16 seems to be the only marker used for tracking senescence. Given the heterogeneity of senescence, that may be limiting in terms of applicability. Additional markers are needed to confirm senescence.\n- Although referred to, there is no formal plan to validate their markers using human biospecimens. That seems to be a critical missing element looking forward to potential value.\n\n# Longevity WG scientific evaluation digest:\n\nThe 4 senior reviewers have expressed a **vote in agreement** to **fund this proposal**. Here is the digest:\n\n**Quantitative reviews:**\n\n> To quantify the level of conviction, they have provided a score on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being the highest).\n> The average score was **4.04/5**\n\n**Brief qualitative review summaries:**\n\n> ### 1)\n>This is one of the most translationally relevant projects in our pipeline, especially with regard to future pharma interest -- they love NK cell therapies and they're increasingly aware of senolytics. SENS is a strong mission-aligned partner and we have the potential to collaborate with them much more in the future. The team is well qualified to carry out the work, and it is likely to result in Composition of Matter IP around the CAR-NK sequence. Overall it's a great fit for us. \n\n>\n> ### 2)\n>Strengths:  Novel target molecules have been identified with sound supporting preliminary data.  Targeting of senescent cells is an attractive therapeutic approach for a range of age-related diseases and relevant to the DAO mission.  The application of CAR NK cells is of growing interest as a therapeutic strategy, presenting opportunity.  Strong scientific team within a supporting research environment.\n> Weaknesses:  The main issue will be whether their new target molecules will provide increased specificity in the clearance of bad senescent cells over good cells.  That poses risk, but needs to be determined.  At present, limited plan to confirm efficacy of targets in human biospecimens, although a brief mention is noted.\n\n>\n> ### 3)\n>\n> The project is a solid idea presented by a solid team. However, it's in a preliminary stage with a lot of unknowns relative to other projects.\n> \n> Pros:\n> \n> * SENS is mission aligned with VitaDAO\n> * PI has solid expertise\n> * CAR-NK cells and antibodies are valuable assets\n> \n> Cons:\n> \n> * It's unclear whether in vitro senescence markers will have the same importance in vivo\n> * It's unclear whether the team has generated CAR-NK before. Feasibility of making the patentable material is unknown.\n> * It's unclear what will determine when CAR-NK cells vs. antibodies will be prioritized.\n> * The in vivo disease model has not yet been identified. This could be substantial work to find the best model.\n\n> ### 4) \n> I believe we should fund this project.  The project is led by an experienced PI, and the team is well suited to carry out the work.  The negotiations have re-focused the project on the generation of useful IP, which there would likely be interest in commercializing (from VCs or Pharma) if the work proves to be successful.  The creation of CAR NK cells that lead to the selective killing of senescent cells is certainly aligned with the mission of VitaDAO, advancing longevity research.  There are, however, still risks - the project is early in its development, so there is some risk that no valuable IP will be generated, even in the 2 year timeframe. Really impressive PI and work.\n\nFor more information, please see the [phase 2 proposal and discussion on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-38-apoptosens-senolytic-car-nk-cells/572).\n\n",

      "title": "VDP-18 [Funding] Jonathan An - Towards reversing periodontal disease using Geroscience",
      "content": "This proposal asks for up to 300.000 USD to fund Jonathan An's research on geroscience-based treatments for periodontitis.\n\n## Longevity Dealflow team\n\n**Scientific evaluation** : Jason Colasanti, Ariella Coler-Reilly, Tyler Golato and 2 anonymous reviewers (professor)\n**Business evaluation** : Tim Peterson, Sara Ramos Colmenarejo\n**Shepherd** : Estéfano Pinilla\n\n**Project PI** : Dr Jonathan An\n\n\n## Simple Summary\nPeriodontal disease (periodontitis) is a chronic oral disease impacting over 70% of older adults, where inflammation of the tissues supporting the teeth results in loss of connective tissue attachment, bone, and ultimately the tooth. The greatest underlying risk factor for periodontitis is age, and its association with other age-related diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer disease, highlights the importance of incorporating this oral disease in geroscience studies. Jonathan An’s lab proposes to test a series of compounds targeting inflammation in a mouse model of age-related periodontitis, with the goal of finding a geroscience-based treatment for this neglected disease that has a severe impact on human healthspan. \n\n## Problem\n\nEfforts to slow the progression of periodontitis in older adults have been attempted through various therapies, including scaling and root planing (“deep cleanings”) or antibacterial adjuncts to reduce pathogens in the pocket, but these treatment modalities are invasive, need to be repeated often, and rely on access to such modalities, which may be limited for many older adults. Furthermore, current therapies are limited to treating the symptoms and fail to address the underlying cellular and molecular causes of periodontal disease, which we hypothesize are a direct consequence of biological aging.\n\n## Opportunity\n\nA component in most age-related disease and decline is a low-grade, chronic inflammation without overt infection known as “inflammaging”. Among the various organ systems that undergo inflammaging, periodontal disease involves most, if not all, sources and outcomes of inflammaging. Thus, evaluating pathways that target “inflammaging” may provide a unique, Geroscience-based treatment modality to reverse periodontal disease. This novel approach to treat periodontal disease is expected to establish the first medical, non-surgical treatment for an age-related oral disease. Moreover, this approach to treat periodontal loss is expected to have a positive impact on age-related cognitive decline.\n\nJonathan An’s Lab proposes to use small molecule inhibitors of the PI3K/NFkB/mTOR pathway to treat periodontal disease, and will test 5 candidates administered orally in the chow in an 8-week study, using rapamycin as a positive control. The drugs have well established pharmacokinetics and pharmacology since they have been investigated for other indications. \n\nIf this first study demonstrates that any of the small molecules is effective in reversing periodontal disease when administered systemically, a second sub-study will be carried out to test the effectiveness of their local delivery by brushing the interventions across the gum line, comparing them with locally delivered rapamycin.\n\nThe proposal is mainly based on a recent eLife paper (https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.54318.sa2) by the research group, where they find positive effects of 8-week treatment with oral rapamycin in age-related periodontal bone loss in mice. The proposed interventions have never been before tested in the context of aging and periodontal disease. Johnathan An’s Lab envision improvement of the periodontal disease phenotype after 8-week treatment with the candidate compounds maybe a result of (1) an improvement of systemic “inflammaging” to impact periodontal disease that will be tested with the first study, or (2) a direct improvement of periodontal disease, which will be tested with the second study. Either result could be the base for novel IP regarding formulation and/or delivery methods to improve aging, inflammation, and periodontal disease. Jonathan An’s collaborators also have preliminary data showing that a few of the tested interventions have beneficial effects on neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Therefore, besides periodontal bone loss, the study will address effects on cognitive function and lifespan.\n\nResults from the proposed study will provide critical pre-clinical IP data to support a future company targeting periodontal disease through geroscience, which the investigator(s) intend to spin out with support from VitaDAO.\n\n## IP Roadmap\nIf any of the locally administered treatments reverses periodontal disease, Jonathan An’s team envision the following path towards IP:\n\n* **Localized Delivery of Compound X to Oral Cavity**\n  * **To treat (indications):**\n    * Age-related periodontal disease in older adults\n    * Peri-implantitis (periodontal disease of implants) in older adults\n  * **Method 1: Compound X Toothpaste**\n    * Prescription (from the dental office or medical office)\n    * Over the counter (in low doses)\n  * **Method 2: Direct Delivery of Compound X to periodontal pockets with periodontal disease**\n    * IP surrounding **both** formulation and delivery mode\n    * Completed in dental offices (medical offices)\n    * *Example* : Local delivery of antimicrobial compounds, *Arestin* *Ò*\n  * **Method 3: Compund X trays**\n    * Example: Whitening trays\n\nIf Jonathan An’s Lab observes an effect in lifespan and healthspan, additional test of feasibility and safety in other mammalian models (i.e., non-human primates) will begin for application in clinic to target aging.\n\n## Team\n\nJonathan An: Project Lead, Assistant Professor at University of Washington.

      "content": "This proposal asks for up to 100.000 USD to co-fund Longevity Hackers, a documentary by Filmmaker Michal Siewierski.\n\n# Synopsis\n\n\"*Our mission is to help promote the fields of longevity and healthy life extension in this film, and help generate additional exposure for the industry with the goal of helping it achieve its funding goals in order to speed up research on anti-aging drugs, treatments and procedures.*\n\n*Another goal is to empower and educate the viewers about the latest advances in the fields of longevity, health span and radical life extension as well as lifestyle and dietary interventions that could potentially increase the chances of people living long enough to take advantage of the upcoming exciting life extension therapies of the near future.*\"\n\n*Michal Siewierski - Filmmaker*\n\n# Summary\n\nVitaDAO, through it’s Community and Awareness working group, has been responsible for not only building our community of token holders and advocates, but also for taking a leading role in producing communication and educational content to establish the importance of credible science in the field of healthspan and longevity research.\n\nBetween numerous online articles, journal club sessions on Clubhouse, Twitter spaces, and YouTube content, the Community and Awareness Working Group  has been successful in raising awareness of both VitaDAO and its mission. However, the impact of this awareness is limited to those who already have an interest in the longevity field or web3 space.\n\nThe proposed project continues to support that community growth and educational theme, but with the goal of both extending its visibility to a wider community, as well as investing in and receiving financial returns from the production of a feature length, independent film to be released later this year.\n\n# Background\n\nLongevity Hackers follows Emmy Nominated Filmmaker Michal Siewierski on a journey to discover the latest research and science breakthroughs in the field of longevity and healthy life extension. Featuring the top experts, scientists, researchers, startup CEO’s as well as celebrities and critics in the longevity space. Many of the interviewed experts believe that we are on the brink of being able to dramatically increase human healthspan and lifespan within the next 20 to 30 years, and others more extreme believe humans might someday become immortal. This fascinating field entices human curiosity and creates hope for a longer and healthier life in the not-so-distant future. The film gives the viewer an unbiased view, with balanced perspectives and opinions on the topic.\n\n**The Company**\n\nNew Roots Films is a US-based independent filmmaking company located in Phoenix, Arizona founded by Emmy Award nominated filmmaker Michal Siewierski and business partner Ruben Figueres. \n\n**Michal Siewierski** is a world renowned documentary filmmaker and TV producer. Michal has received multiple Emmy Award nominations and won several Telly Awards and Hermes Awards. Michal has over 20 years of experience in the fields of television production and filmmaking, having produced several globally renowned feature documentaries, including, Food Choices, Diet Fiction, Takeout, among others. His films have been translated to over 20 languages and some played in over 150 countries. Michal has also produced hundreds of TV commercials over the years for many prestigious clients including several fortune 500 companies and presidential campaigns. His productions have played on several TV stations throughout the United States and around the world. Nowadays Michal’s focus is in creating documentaries about topics that can benefit people’s lives and create disruptive positive change to our society and our planet. Michal is also passionate about longevity, science and health.\n\n**Ruben Figueres** is an entrepreneur, media expert, best selling author and accomplished Ironman athlete. Ruben Figueres brings over two decades of media, business and advertising experience to the table, with his work ranging from fortune five hundred companies to presidential campaigns. Having executive produced hundreds of TV commercials, TV shows and infomercials. Ruben recently joined the New Roots Films team as a Director of business affairs and co-producer on \"Longevity Hackers\".\n\n\n# Why “Longevity Hackers” Matters?\n\nSince June 2021 when VitaDAO was launched, there has been a considerable increase in interest in the field of longevity and healthspan related research. VitaDAO itself was formed to allow a web3 crowdsourcing approach to IP development and investing for  advancing the science of healthspan research.\n\nWhile this growth has been impressive, the community itself still is quite small - this is surprising given that billions of US dollars are spent every year on cosmetic, sometimes scientifically questionable, and oftentimes marginally effective treatments to satisfy the popular desire to mitigate age-related ailments. So while popular interest is obviously there (as well as the commercial interest), the understanding and access to the science of longevity and healthspan research  is limited, and consequently dramatically underfunded relative to other medical areas.\n\nTo harness some of the popular interest in longevity as well as redirect some of the financial interest into our community, a wider net needs to be cast to show that there is serious science being worked on in the field and opportunities to participate in its development.\n\nIn the past six months, VitaDAO as well as other members of the longevity eco-system have had several Clubhouse sessions on the communications surrounding the Longevity field, these conversations have further highlighted that there needs to be a proactive approach to managing the narrative around the longevity field, discouraging and calling out “snake-oil” science, and showing that many of the researchers and people involved in this field are as serious, capable and scientifically rigorous as any others involved in medical research. \n\nAn investment in a high-quality production looking at the field in an unbiased way will lend credibility not only to the longevity field but also support VitaDAO’s mission especially where we have made great efforts to ensure that our educational communications are scientifically sound. \n\nIt should also be noted that the cost of our Community and Awareness program is an essential expense for VitaDAO, which generates goodwill for VitaDAO in terms of reputation, and network effects. However, the potential reach and visibility from a film, combined with the upside potential of commercial success, makes this an attractive project, especially when compared to our typical  expenses associated with community building and educational communications.\n\n# Opportunity\n\nThe Longevity Hackers film is a $2M project. This includes promotion, distribution, and high quality production values. \n\nFunding has already been obtained from LongevityTech.fund as well as a number of other investors. A 1% stake in the film is $20,000. Consequently, we believe a 5% stake at $100k is a suitable amount. \nGiven the funding that the project has received to date, filming has been underway over the past 6 months, which will reduce the time-to-market for the film and, all things being equal, for the start of returns to investors in the film which would probably occur in late 2022 or 2023.\n\n\n# Budget:\n\nWe are proposing that the VitaDAO community authorizes **up to $100k** of funding from the Treasury towards an investment in the production of the Longevity Hackers film, subject to successful negotiations and deal structure.\n\nThe official Longevity Hackers presentation can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OeOBqD-pP6lFHB3TiL7Kt3WsB4M4OKdq/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThe film website can be found at: [www.longevityhackers.tv](http://www.longevityhackers.tv/)\n\nFor more information, please see [the phase 2 proposal and discussion on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-39-longevity-hackers-film-participation/573).",

      "title": "VDP-32 [Funding] Hyperspectral imaging for early diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease",
      "content": "This proposal asks for 30.000 EUR to fund Mantis Photonics' camera technology for early screening of Alzheimer Disease.\n\n- Business evaluation: Tyler Golato, Tim Peterson\n- Shepherd: Koen De Lombaert\n- Reviewers: Jason Colasanti, Tyler Stahl, Koen De Lombaert\n- Sourced by: Koen De Lombaert\n\n### Simple Summary\n\nAlzheimer’s Disease is the main cause of dementia worldwide. There is currently no easy way to diagnose it. As a result, patients get diagnosed too late, once their cognitive decline has started. Mantis Photonics AB is developing a hyperspectral camera for retinal imaging for the early screening of Alzheimer Disease via the detection of the Amyloid beta peptide. The retina displays similarities to the brain and spinal cord in terms of anatomy, functionality, response to insult, and immunology. Hence, the eye provides a unique window to the central nervous system without the need for expensive, invasive, and/or potentially harmful examinations. (https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-020-00715-1)\n\nThis camera will fit on a fundoscope routinely used by opticians and ophthalmologists. It will be developed to detect patients with high levels of amyloid up to 15 years before their cognitive ability declines. Earlier diagnosis will considerably increase chances to adopt a healthy lifestyle to reduce/postpone the risk of getting Alzheimer as well as increasing the chance of getting treatment in time.\n\n### Problem\n\nCurrent methods to detect amyloid:\n\n* Measuring amyloid plaques in the brain directly with amyloid PET scan. This is a lengthy and costly procedure.\n* FDA approved retinal camera by Optina (FDA 510(k) clearance for its Mydriatic Hyperspectral Retinal Camera (MHRC-C1) in 2020). This camera uses its own light source; it cannot be mounted on a fundoscope and is very expensive. Estimated at >50k Euro, hindering mass adoption.\n\n### Opportunity\n\nMantis Photonics is developing a hyperspectral camera that can be easily added to routine fundoscopy at opticians and ophthalmologists for the detection of amyloid deposits in the retina. There is peer-reviewed proof-of-concept research supporting hyperspectral retinal imaging to classify AD patients vs controls (https://alzres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13195-020-00715-1). This camera is a follow-on diagnostic as there’s an existing camera developed by Optina. This proves clinical validity as well as regulatory approval. Optina’s camera is estimated to be at least 5x the cost of Mantis. Optina’s camera is also a standalone device instead of an add-on to existing workflow\n\nThe team is seeking bridge funding until their seed round later this year to collect in vivo data in mice/humans of their camera.\n\n### IP Roadmap\n\nThe Mantis Photonics camera technology is protected by two patents (P436042SE00 & SE542835C2).\n\n### Team\n\nDiego Guenot, PhD is CTO and the inventor of the hyper spectral camera patent. He is an expert in Laser and Photonics with a PhD at Lund University and has started working on this topic in 2018.\n\nDenis Hellebuyck is CEO. He is an electro-mechanical engineer. Denis has previously worked in several startups in Belgium, Italy, and South Africa.\n\nJan Alexander is software developer and AI specialist.\n\n### Budget\n\nBridge funds requested: 30,000 EUR\n\n* 15k EUR for an improved version of the camera\n* 15k EUR for clinical and preclinical verification testing\n\n### Strengths\n\n* There is a FDA approved retina amyloid detection camera already on the market\n* There is peer-reviewed proof-of-concept research supporting hyperspectral retinal imaging to classify AD patients\n* Ability to become a platform diagnostic for several aging related and other conditions: AMD, diabetic retinopathy, etc\n* Team\n* Relatively low valuation of Mantis Photonics at this time ($3-4M)\n\n### Risks\n\n* Prototype stage\n* Mantis has no data in mice/humans that camera works\n* Questions around amyloid in pathophysiology of AD\n\n### Outcome of the evaluation and recommendation\n\nOf all the evaluators, 3 independently scored the project proposal on different categories as either: (1) Outstanding, (2) Strong, (3) Satisfactory, (4) Weak, (5) Unacceptable, (N/A) Not enough information provided, or (N/A) Not my area of expertise. This is a summary of the results:\n\n* Novelty and Impact: (2) Strong (1/3 evaluators), (3) Satisfactory (2/3 evaluators)\n* Feasibility and Data: (N/A) Not enough information provided (1/3 evaluators); (5) Unacceptable (1/3 evaluators); (3) Satisfactory (1/3 evaluators)\n* Relevance to longevity: (2) Strong (2/3 evaluators); (3) Satisfactory (1/3 evaluators)\n* Science Team: (1) Outstanding (1/3 evaluators); (2) Strong (1/3 evaluators); (3) Satisfactory (1/3 evaluators)\n* Market Advantage: (2) Strong (1/3 evaluators); (3) Satisfactory (2/3 evaluators)\n* IP-NFT Potential: N/A (equity deal)\n\nAll the evaluators consider the project worth funding by the VitaDAO community.\n\nFor more information, please see [the phase 2 proposal and discussion on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-32-hyperspectral-imaging-for-early-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease/558).\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "VDP-34 [Governance] Defining VitaCore",
      "content": "This proposal defines VitaCore to consist of four stakeholder groups who are accountable to VITA token holders.\n# Summary\n\nThis proposal introduces a definition of the concept of \"VitaCore\", specifying four stakeholder groups: Working group stewards and co-stewards, ambassadors of service providers, ambassadors of partner DAOs and strategic contributors.\n\n# Motivation\n\nFrom VitaDAO’s inception and even before Genesis, a group of highly involved contributors helped oversee the objectives and coordinate activities across working groups, the community and external stakeholders. This group became known as “VitaCore” and continues to keep the DAO productive to date. However, the concept of VitaCore is loosely defined and not well documented, hence the need for a governance proposal defining VitaCore.\n\n# Specification\n\nWe propose to define VitaCore as an advisory committee that represents various groups of VitaDAO stakeholders. As such, VitaCore does not have any individual members, but individuals who are part of a certain stakeholder group.\n\nTo start with, these stakeholder groups are:\n\n* Group 1: Working Group Stewards and Co-Stewards\n* Group 2: Ambassadors of actively and significantly contributing Service Providers (currently Molecule GmbH and decentralized MATTER B.V.)\n* Group 3: Ambassadors of VitaDAO’s partner DAOs (currently labDAO)\n* Group 4: Representatives from strategic contributors (currently none, [TBD.](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/continuing-the-discussion-what-happens-after-vdp-11/512))\n\nFurther stakeholder groups may be added in the future.\n\nIt goes without saying that the concept of VitaCore is accountable to VitaDAO’s token holders who defined the scope of VitaCore’s executive power over operational decisions [in VDP-6](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.vitadao.eth/proposal/0x29deeaa40d52ca82f2533f459d9a3e744c9598cee5e106f9176f35b1c9bdf02b) and may refine these at any time in a new governance proposal. In that sense, holders of VITA are represented in VitaCore, but they are the overseeing and superior entity that governs VitaCore through proposals. Current initiatives around introducing OKRs, publishing a treasury report and other transparency initiatives will make it significantly more convenient for token holders to do so.\n\n# Implementation\n\nIf this proposal passes, we will publish a post (on Discourse, Medium, the website or another appropriate place) to make the list of stakeholder groups and their individual members permanently available .

      "title": "VDP-31 [Funding] Support of Clinical Trial \"The Effect of Regular Exercise & Intermittent Rapamycin Dosing...\"",
      "content": "This proposal asks for $50.000 USD to support a clinical trial by Dr. Brad Stanfield on exercise and Rapamycin dosing.\n\n*Full title: Support of Clinical Trial: \"The Effect of Regular Exercise & Intermittent Rapamycin Dosing on Muscle Performance in Older Adults\"*\n\n# Summary\n\n*“The overall hypothesis we wish to investigate is whether periods of time where the mechanistic target of Rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is activated via exercise, combined with alternate periods of time where mTOR is inhibited using Sirolimus (Rapamycin), will result in greater muscle performance in older adults compared with just exercise alone.\"* - Dr. Brad Stanfield.\n\nIt is proposed that VitaDAO **provide $50,000 USD** (1/8th of the project budget) and look to activate our community to solicit more funding.\n\n# Motivation\n\nVitaDAO, recognizes the importance of credible science in the field of healthspan and longevity research. One aspect of current longevity research that remains challenging is the translation of research from model organisms to humans, and the clinical trials regime that is imposed on new interventions.\n\nThere is a view that a number of currently approved drugs - those that have long since completed the regulatory hurdles - have shown observable,  incremental effects on longevity. One such drug  is Rapamycin.\n\nRapamycin is an approved drug for prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients aged 13 years or older receiving renal transplants. The proposed study is meant to establish whether intermittent Rapamycin use demonstrates a functional improvement in frailty and sarcopenia endpoints. \n\n# Specification\n\nThe clinical study will be lead by Dr. Brad Stanfield.\n\nDr. Brad Stanfield is a Medical Doctor at the Tuakau Health Centre in New Zealand having completed his residency at Auckland DHB.\n\nIn 2019, he started his YouTube channel to discuss the state of longevity science with an emphasis on explaining peer-reviewed scientific papers in easy-to-understand language, but also with a focus on providing proper limits to the science and discouraging claims which exceed the evidence.\n\nWith a community of over 98,000 followers, Dr. Stanfield has become a recognized and credible voice in the communications of longevity science.\n\n*Why another Rapamycin trial?*\n\nAs a Phase 2a trial in humans - focused on functional improvements in sarcopenia - this study will support our understanding of Rapamycin impacts on aging related decline in physical function, but also work towards establishing a framework for regulatory approval of interventions that are preventative in nature related to aging.\n\nThe clinical trial protocol can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AP1L9JjGdnZgFmZ4sEDCWnp_2-g70-SP/view). \n\nIn contrast to the ongoing PEARL trial for rapamycin and aging (NCT04488601), this proposed trial will measure muscle power and strength by combining rapamycin intake with an exercise regimen. The primary outcome for this proposed trial is the 30-second chair test, which is a robust and clinically relevant marker of performance. In addition, several secondary outcomes will be measured including but not limited to: community balance and mobility, hand grip strength, 6-minute walk test, DNA methylation age, and serum levels of NAD+, cholesterol, and S6K. Importantly, this Phase 2 study is not powered enough to say that Rapamycin + exercise is better than exercise alone, instead it will be used to determine safety and some preliminary results. This proposed trial will be a stepping stone to a much larger study involving ~400-500 individuals. \n\n# Implementation\n\nThough there is no immediate intellectual property for VitaDAO from this project, our support is intended to advocate for further research into off-label use of approved, off-patent drugs and show our support for innovative and crowdsourced funding of research.\n\nThis is complementary to VitaDAO’s support of CrowdFundedCures.org, and the social impact bond model in VDP-17.\n\nDr. Stanfield has developed a strong following on YouTube for his informative and well researched videos on healthspan related interventions and science, and is an asset to the longevity community and we wish to signal our support for this research with the intention of supporting Dr. Stanfield to raise the needed funds for the trial.\n\n*Budget*\n\nThe budget for the clinical trial is $400,000. It is suggested that VitaDAO would provide $50,000 USD (1/8th of the project budget) and look to activate our community to solicit more funding. In the United States, Lifespan.io is supporting the fundraising for the trail as a 501(c)3 charity.\n\nFor more information, please see the [phase 2 proposal and discussion on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-31-support-of-clinical-trial-the-effect-of-regular-exercise-intermittent-rapamycin-dosing-on-muscle-performance-in-older-adults/557).",

      "title": "VDP-33 [Governance] PrimeDAO <> VitaDAO Partnership Proposal + Token Swap",
      "content": "This proposal intends to initiate a partnership between [PrimeDAO](https://www.prime.xyz/) and VitaDAO through a token swap and other means.\n\n**Representatives**: \n- [Vincent](https://twitter.com/vincentweisser) (VitaDAO)\n- [Luuk]( https://twitter.com/LuukDAO) (PrimeDAO)\n\n\n## Summary\nInitiating a partnership with PrimeDAO, a DAO building next-generation coordination tools for DAOs, and VitaDAO, to explore how VitaDAO can utilize and benefit from PrimeDAO's offerings as well as align through a token swap of ~$50k worth of Prime<>Vita.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThis partnership agreement is initiated on the 3th of March 2022, by and between:\n\n[VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/), a community owned collective funding early stage longevity research, governed through the [VitaDAO Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.vitadao.eth).\n\nand\n\n[PrimeDAO](https://www.prime.xyz/), a A DAO collective focused on researching and building next-generation coordination tools for decentralized organizations, governed through the [PrimeDAO Boardroom](https://app.boardroom.info/primedao/overview).\n\n## Partnership Purpose\nThe partnership aims to align the interest of the parties to intensify the collaboration between the organizations. PrimeDAO provides DAO tools which we want to further explore with VitaDAO, and provide input on which tools would be most useful for us and our ecosystem. This also creates mutual awareness in both DAOs through the introduction of this proposal, as well as governance alignment of VitaDAO being able to govern PrimeDAO through its governance votes, and vice versa. \n\n\n## Background on the Partnership\nVitaDAO and PrimeDAO share a common purpose to push the abilities of DAOs to fund and advance human potential. Contributors of the DAOs have been connected and sharing knowledge since the early days of DAOs, back in 2019. Both groups see value in intensifying our relationship with this partnership agreement.\n\n## Commitment of the Organizations\nBoth parties agreed that they intend to contribute the following towards this partnerships:\n\n1. Token Swap:\nTo align governance interests, a Token Swap between the two organizations is initiated as part of this agreement. $50.000 worth of VITA will be swapped for $50,000 of D2D taken the 30-day average at the end of the vote on both sides.\n\n2. Co-liquidity Provision:\nTo enhance alignment, the DAOs plan to explore a potential Vita<>Prime pool for the further, while this is part of further discussion and review from tokenomics.\n\n1. VitaDAO will match the received D2D tokens with an equal value in BAL tokens from its treasury and add it to the [50% D2D x 50% BAL pool on Balancer.](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x8f4205e1604133d1875a3e771ae7e4f2b086563900020000000000000000010e)\n\n2. PrimeDAO will match the received VITA with an amount of WETH - equal to 25% of the amount received - and add it to the [80% VITA x 20% WETH pool on Balancer. ](https://app.balancer.fi/#/pool/0x350196326aeaa9b98f1903fb5e8fc2686f85318c000200000000000000000084)\n\nBoth DAOs will be eligible to earn rewards associated with these two pools. There are no lock-ups or limitations to which the DAOs need to adhere to in regards to the received tokens, however it is expected that both DAOs will communicate any changes to the usage of the tokens to the other party.\n\n## Management of the Partnership\n\n### Partnership Term\nThe Partnership is open-ended and does not have an expiry date.\n\n### Partnership Governance\nThe partnership is managed by representatives of the organizations. The respective governance processes of both DAOs can overwrite any decision by representatives.\n\nIn the case of this partnership, there are 2 representatives for each organization.\n\n### Exit Clause\nBoth organizations can at any moment terminate the agreement through their respective governance systems.\n\n### Communications around the Partnership\n- A partnership announcement blog will be created within 2 weeks after the agreement date.\n\n- To ensure operational effectiveness, a monthly call will be set up by at least one representative of each organization.\n\nBoth DAOs acknowledge that DAO agreements are inherently unpredictable and irreversible and agree to this initial partnership agreement (pending governance vote outcome).\n\nFor more information, please see the [phase 2 proposal and discussion on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-33-primedao-vitadao-partnership-proposal-token-swap/559).",

      "title": "VDP-26 [Governance] Dealflow structure & incentives",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal provides clarity to the VitaDAO community on how the Longevity Dealflow Working Group operates.\n\nTL;DR: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOWzFcCo=/ \n\nThe group’s purpose is to make good deals happen (ie fund longevity projects) on behalf of VitaDAO.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe dealflow process has been designed by experienced investors, entrepreneurs and scientists to meet two objectives:\n\n1. To maximize the number of high-quality longevity projects VitaDAO funds\n2. To upskill the community such that #1 is more likely.\n\nBy providing more people with clarity on the core activity of VitaDAO we can scale more easily.\n\n# 1. What can *you* do?\n\nThe highest impact actions are:\n\n1. Source relevant longevity projects\n2. Shepherd projects\n  a. Gather information and due diligence\n  b. Get 3-5 independent reviews (2-4 Scientific Advisory Board members and 1-2 business/IP experts)\n3. Negotiate and close deals\n4. Assist current portfolio projects to advance towards commercialization\n5. Improve the process. See one, do one, teach one.\n\n# 2. What is a relevant project?\n\n[Relevant projects](https://vitadao.notion.site/Sourcing-projects-for-VitaDAO-7eba65929ec94725a9a72b931f6de315) would be aging research / longevity projects that are seeking funding (sponsorship, investments, grants) and open to sharing IP / revenue / some mutual benefit / upside.\n\nWe are aiming for 80%+ of our resources to fund early-stage, translational aging research (pre-startup), bridging the valley of death. The remaining percentage is to fund longevity startups that have a high potential to get to market fast.\n\nWe are looking for projects that we can help advance towards commercialization, usually a therapeutic targeting aging. A good model for what is in-scope and out-of-scope is Karl Pfledger’s outline of [What Counts As Aging For AgingBiotech.Info](https://agingbiotech.info/about/what_counts_as_aging.html)\n\n# 3. What are standard terms for funding?\n\nThis usually implies the researcher, company and/or institution (TTO) signing a contract with an agent like Molecule GmbH, a Swiss company. This can be a standard Sponsored Research Agreement, Royalty Agreement, providing attractive non-dilutive financing.\n\n# 4. How does the dealflow process work?\n\n## 4A. Sourcing relevant projects\n\nProjects can be either referred to us by the community, discovered through outreach (by scouts or internal sourcing squads), or inbound via the website.\n\nAnyone can be a scout or form a sourcing squad to increase efficiency in sourcing projects.\n\nThe current [bounty](https://airtable.com/shr1JVPeWle7qLlau) (until March 15th) is $500 or 500 VITA per relevant project you introduce to us (up to a reasonable cap approved by no less than 2 stewards, see [full terms here](https://vitadao.notion.site/Sourcing-projects-for-VitaDAO-7eba65929ec94725a9a72b931f6de315)). More bounties can be seen below.\n\nHow? Reach out to researchers, TTOs, communities, conferences, prioritize promising leads, develop relationships.\n\n## 4B. Shepherding projects (getting reviews, due diligence, etc)\n\nOnce a relevant project is identified, a deal squad is formed (2-3 members, based on skill and interest) with a shepherd as the main point of contact.\n\nThe squad works to advance the deal through our funnel (where we can view at a glance the stage, details, or bottlenecks of the deals). See the workflow here: https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOYCpe8I=/\n\n## 4B.1) Refining projects, gathering information\n\nThe shepherd coordinates with the applicant to get any follow-up questions answered and potentially help refine or create a path to commercialization.\n\nGather information, due diligence in a Project Details document (see [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LzI0nEW1AvWoDgzixSh2TN75hAW-LUXjIfF5riWDf8I/edit#)). This will be access-controlled, with careful consideration to whom is given access, based on the level of confidentiality required.\n\n## 4B.2) Getting reviews\n\nThe shepherd will send the Project Details document (containing all info, including our review form) to 3-5 independent Senior Reviewers (2-4 Scientific Advisory Board members, 1-2 business/IP experts) for discrete, unbiased evaluation (kept secret until after the review stage is over).\n\nWe are maintaining a list of [Senior Reviewers and candidates in the Dealflow CRM](https://airtable.com/appqo3bPXVQojAtrk/tblLCrQVaR4PmrG1P/viwHx3CValDXVrwDP?blocks=hide), and for each person in there we have \"Shepherds\", team members maintaining that relationship. If you don't have a relationship but want their review, you can reach out to one of the shepherds of that relationship to introduce you as a team member and make sure random people don't spam Senior Reviewers.\n\n> Reviews, if possible, can be visible internally (although anonymized).\n      - These could be restricted to the shepherd\n      - I’d want to know who reviewed so I can continue the conversation, and can keep it confidential\n\n## 4B.3) Summarizing reviewers consensus\n\nThe squad will make a summary of the senior reviews (including the conviction) and gauge the level of excitement.\n\nWe have 4 tiers:\n\nA) 🤩 Very exciting (stellar team, exciting tech etc). We keep a healthy dose of skepticism but all we need to close is final dd and negotiation.\n\nB) 💪 Potentially strong, worth following up → set up a call or send a list of questions\n\nC) 🤔 Unconvincing. Wouldn’t be worth talking unless they show us X,Y,Z (big changes) → tell them what we’d need to see for it to be an (A)\n\nD) 🙅 Out of scope or surely not gonna work, not worth talking with them → tell them why, but re-application is welcome\n\n## 4B.4) Posting a report for the community\n\nIf the deal falls in Tier A from above, we post the project on the Discourse governance forum as a Phase 2 proposal, for broader community feedback. They will get a “stamp of approval” from the Longevity Dealflow WG, with a quantitative score and (3-6) different brief reviews (in favor, against, or neutral).\n\nTier B is the most common. While we get the follow-up questions answered, we can post the project for community feedback in the “Projects in review” section of our Discourse forum. It only moves to a Phase 2 VDP when we have consensus on that precious “stamp of approval”.\n\nPublic Discourse posts will be done with assistance and agreement from the applicant.\n\nFor Tier C or Tier D, we’ll send a \"not now” email asking for more data or whatever changes we need to move it to Tier A.\n\nUntil they make the necessary changes, applicants can submit their projects to our “Projects in review” section, allowing for community feedback and involvement.\n\nThis wouldn’t be a recommendation from the team.\n\nWe shouldn’t send a clear “NO” email to any project unless we all agree that it is out of scope or stupid. Passing on good projects is the nightmare scenario, and VitaDAO is not (and should not be) so risk-averse. The danger is the status quo, with promising projects overlooked by regular investors not getting the funding that would advance longevity therapeutics.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/alex_kroeger/status/1461433455296716804?s=21\n\n## 4B.5) Negotiation and closing\n\nIf the Phase 2 vote passes, we move to Phase 3, for a token-based, final vote.\n\nThe squad negotiates with TTOs, gets consensus around terms (ticket size, ownership stake, etc) and works to close the deal.\n\n## 4C. Assisting current portfolio projects\n\nThe ultimate goal is to advance research towards commercialization as longevity therapeutics.

      "content": "This proposal requests a total of $55,000 USDC to take part in a Gitcoin round as well as to fund Longevity Fellowships.\n\n## Summary\nProposal for VitaDAO to donate $40,000 USDC to match donations for longevity research initiatives through the next upcoming quadratic donation round on [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) in March 2022, as well as to provide $15,000 USDC donation to fund [VitaDAO Longevity Fellows](https://www.vitadao.com/fellowship) with micro-grants of up to $3,000 USDC.\n\n- **Project Lead:**  Vincent Weisser#9975\n- **Team**: timrpeterson#8928, Tyler Golato#5399, Retromancers#3866, Laurence Ion#4088, Scott Moore, Alex Dobrin\n\n## Description\nIn collaboration with [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/), VitaDAO should co-organize a donation round for longevity-related projects in March 2022. The donation round would utilise quadratic funding which [tackles](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html) the tragedy of the commons, a common problem with public goods such as funding longevity research. As part of this donation round, VitaDAO should provide 40,000 USDC as a matching donor.\n\n## Motivation\nThe goal is to advance longevity research beyond our core focus of directly funding research with intellectual property. We are collaborating with Gitcoin to advance unique ways to fund research through crypto and by the crypto community.\n\nIndividuals like Vitalik Buterin, Glen Weyl and others proposed a system called quadratic funding, where some donors quadratically match donations from other donors. This results in a situation where individual donors may spend just as much as it benefits themselves, but due to these matching donations, effectively cause a total spend that takes into account the benefit of others. For more information on how quadratic funding works, see [this blog post by Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html) as well as “[WTF is Quadratic Funding?](https://wtfisqf.com/)”.\n\nGitcoin proved this in practice, funding projects with millions of dollars already. As a pioneer in quadratic funding with experience from previous donation rounds and a high-profile network of donors, Gitcoin is the ideal partner for VitaDAO to organize a donation round specifically for longevity-related projects.\n\n## Specification\nThe VitaDAO Longevity Working Group has curated a list of over 30 projects that seem like a good fit for this donation round. The curation process focused on smaller, relatively underfunded initiatives that could benefit a lot from additional funding. \n\nYou can see the already onboarded projects from last round here: [https://gitcoin.co/grants/explorer/?&grant_tags=Longevity](https://gitcoin.co/grants/explorer/?&grant_tags=Longevity)\n\n\n\n## Implementation and Timeline\nBy the end of February, the project list will be finalized and sent to Gitcoin. The funding round is set to start in March 2022 and last for 2 weeks.\n\n\n## Budget\n\nThe budget of 40,000 USDC represents a donation from VitaDAO as a matching funder to Gitcoin’s Quadratic Funding Round in March 2022. Additionally 15,000 USDC would be donated to fund VitaDAO Longevity Fellows.\n\n\n## Explainer \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJljTtLnymE\n\n\nFor more information, please see the [phase 2 proposal and discussion on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-30-vitadao-gitcoin-quadratic-longevity-funding-round-2-vitadao-longevity-fellowship/542).\n",

      "content": "Identification of novel mitophagy inducers for healthy brain ageing and longevity.\n\n- Project PI: [Evandro Fang](https://evandrofanglab.com/)\n- [Project Page on Molecule](https://discover.molecule.to/project-details/1642675660220x661402772267860000)\n\n### **Simple Summary** \nMy group was one of the very first research teams to propose defective mitophagy as a key  driver in AD initiation and progression and to demonstrate its causative role; we have demonstrated the effectiveness of mitophagy induction in inhibiting memory loss in multiple  AD animal models (Trends Neurosci 2017; Nature Neurosci 2019; Cell Metabolism 2019;  Nature Biomedical Engineering 2022)3-5, 8. Previous work has highlighted how impaired  mitophagy coincides with the behavioural and pathological development and progression of  AD. Genetic and pharmacological promotion of mitophagy rescued cognitive decline in AD  models, and inhibited the phosphorylation of Tau (p-Tau) in both human cell lines and 3xTgAD  mice4. However, robust neuronal mitophagy inducers with clinical potential, that is to  induce mitophagy but without causing mitochondrial damage at the same dose, is  sparse. Very recently, we have established an artificial intelligence (named Fang-AI) plus wet  lab validation platform (Figs. 1 and 2), enabled us successful identification of two lead  compunds as drug candidates for AD8, 9. This proposal aims to use the ‘Fang-AI’ plus our wet  lab platform (C. elegans, mice and iPSCs) to swiftly identify new drug candidates for AD.  \n\n### **Background** \nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) affects over 35 million people worldwide and causes formidable  economic challenges1. Since 2003, over 250 drug candidates, predominantly targeting two  pathological proteins, amyloid-β (Aβ) and pathological Tau, have been tested in clinical trials  for AD, but most of them have failed2. There is a need to pursue new mechanistic studies in  order to better understand the underlying causes of AD, and to discover new drug targets.  \n\nMitochondria operate as cellular “powerhouses” and play a pivotal role in neuroplasticity and  memory, thus dysfunction in mitochondria can impair neuronal function and trigger  neurodegeneration3. The homeostatic maintenance of functional mitochondria is crucial for  neuronal health and survival. Mitochondria are constantly exposed to stress and damage; to  cope, dysfunctional mitochondria must be specifically and efficiently eliminated via a cellular  self-clearance system, “mitophagy”. Mitophagy is impaired in the elderly, leading to the  accumulation of damaged mitochondria4. The impaired energy production brought about by  these dysfunctional mitochondria manifests in the senescence, inflammation, and neuronal loss seen in the elderly, and in AD patients3-5. Large-scale omics and functional studies using  post-mortem brain tissues and iPSCs from AD identified impaired mitochondrial function and  impairment of mitochondria-related pathways as major changes in AD4, 6, 7.  \n\nMy group was one of the very first research teams to propose defective mitophagy as a key  driver in AD initiation and progression and to demonstrate its causative role; we have demonstrated the effectiveness of mitophagy induction in inhibiting memory loss in multiple  AD animal models (Trends Neurosci 2017; Nature Neurosci 2019; Cell Metabolism 2019;  Nature Biomedical Engineering 2022)3-5, 8. Previous work has highlighted how impaired  mitophagy coincides with the behavioural and pathological development and progression of  AD. Genetic and pharmacological promotion of mitophagy rescued cognitive decline in AD  models, and inhibited the phosphorylation of Tau (p-Tau) in both human cell lines and 3xTgAD  mice4. However, robust neuronal mitophagy inducers with clinical potential, that is to  induce mitophagy but without causing mitochondrial damage at the same dose, is  sparse. Very recently, we have established an artificial intelligence (named Fang-AI) plus wet  lab validation platform (Figs. 1 and 2), enabled us successful identification of two lead  compunds as drug candidates for AD8, 9. This proposal aims to use the ‘Fang-AI’ plus our wet  lab platform (C. elegans, mice and iPSCs) to swiftly identify new drug candidates for AD.  \n\nAs defective mitophagy is likely a shared cause of different neurodegenerative diseases (such  as Parkinson’s disease/PD, Huntington’s disease/HTT, and Amyotrophic Lateral  Sclerosis/ALS)10, turning up mitophagy via pharmaceutically approaches could be a druggable  target for broad neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n\n### **Proposed Work Packages** \nWP1: To use our established Fang-AI + wet lab validation platform to screen new  mitophagy inducers. \n\n∙ To use our established Fang-AI + wet lab validation platform (Figs. 1 and 2)8to screen new mitophagy inducers from the Finnish Institute of Molecular Medicine (FIMM),  consisting 140,000 compounds (U. Helsinki, with access). We will perform AI  screening and wet lab verification as detailed elsewhere8. We have already identified  26 molecules from the FIMM library (AI score ≥0.8) such as FIMM136359, 104757,  106153, etc.  \n\nWP2: AI-based structure modifications for drug candidates EFF-AA and EFF-BA, and  wet lab validation experiments: \n\nUnpublished data from the Fang group have identified two structurally similar natural  compunds EFF-AA and EFF-BA. They are robust mitophagy inducers with high translational  potential as EFF-AA and EFF-BA induce mitophagy at 10% dose as used for other compunds (e.g, compunds K and R8), and without detectible toxicity in the bioactive doses in cells and C.  elegans.  \n\nFor the purpose of further optimization and patent, we aim:\n \n∙ To use machine learning to provide suggestions on structure modifications on current  known mitophagy inducers (EFF-AA, EFF-BA), aiming to increase ‘solubility’, ‘activity’,  ‘bioavailability’ and to reduce ‘toxicity’;  \n\n∙ To work with chemists and pharmacists to select from the ‘AI-suggested list’, and to  synthesize new compunds (the first two steps will be done via paid service to the  experienced medchem CRO companies, such as Spirochem or Symeres); and  \n\n∙ To use wet lab techniques (majorly cell culture and C. elegans) to validate bioactivity  and anti-AD function of the new compunds.  \n\n∙ Patent applications (note, background IP will apply) \n\nNote: \n\n∙ The Fang group can hold the EFF-AA and EFF-BA data confidential until 30th Dec  2022. After that, the data will be submitted in international peer-reviewed journal (s);  we will have a deal with the target journal and to make sure it will not published until  the end of 30th March 2023. The Ph.D. student will need to get her Ph.D by the fall of  2023 in the precondition of getting her Ph.D. studies to be published by May 2023.  \n\n### **Proposed Milestones** \n∙ Milestone 1 (M01-03): Toxicity assays for FIMM hits - release of 50% of  healthspan, lifespan, mitophagy monitoring budget \n\n∙ Milestone 2 (M01-03): Toxicity assays for EFF-AA/EFF-BA, EC50 EFF AA/EFF-BA mitophagy assays (quantitative criteria tbd.); selected AI \n\nsuggested EFF-AA/EFF-BA compound variants and confirmation of chemical  feasibility (quantitative criteria tbd.) - release of chemical synthesis budget  and release of 50% of healthspan, lifespan, mitophagy monitoring budget \n\n∙ Milestone 3 (M03-07): Positive outcome of mitophagy assays of FIMM hits  (quantitative criteria tbd.) - release of 50% of IHC/ICC, proteomics and RNA seq budget \n\n∙ Milestone 4 (M03-08): Successful chemical synthesis of EFF-AA/EFF-BA  analogues -release of 50% of IHC/ICC, proteomics and RNA-seq budget\n\nEvandro F. Fang (Oslo) \n\nThe Fang team will have their best effort to get all the milestones achieved as proposed. Due  to the COVID-19 (impact the delivery of agents and dedication of the scientists in the lab) and  for any unforeseen difficulties, if an extention is needed for a specific milestone, Fang will be  reaching Molecule/VitaDao to get a new agreed deadline.  \n\nThe total cost of the project would be +$250 - $400k and the DAO would own 100% of the project and associated IP. We could also explore an option where we pay less and co-own the IP with the university.\n\nFor more information, please see [the phase 2 proposal and discussion on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-21-discovery-of-novel-mitophagy-activators-w-evandro-fang/514).",

      "content": "This proposal requests the option to use up to $1M from the VitaDAO treasury for equity investments.\n\n# Summary\n\nWe've learned there are many early stage deals including at universities where equity-based investment rather than NFT-based investment are required. This proposal requests the ***option*** to use up to $1M from the VitaDAO treasury for equity investments.\n\n# Details\n\nFollowing [VDP-7](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-7-equity-startup-deals-proposal/325/8), we have set aside $1.5M to loan to the nonprofit Vitality Healthspan Foundation to make investments in TurnBio and Rubedo. Freeing up an additional $1M would have several advantages over doing no additional equity deals. It would:\n\n1. create more eventual buyers for VitaDAO's IP-NFTs\n2. grow VitaDAO's network and reputation within industry and not just with academia\n3. provide validation to pharma and other incumbents that VitaDAO has assets that others are willing to fund\n4. enable VitaDAO to get insider info from more companies on how the industry is evolving\n5. help VitaDAO upskill academics by putting them in contact with the companies we fund\n\nBy passing this proposal, we would still be within our 80/20 goal to fund mostly *research* , but we would be creating better continuity between academia and industry. Thus, shrinking the \"valley of death\".\n\n# Specification\n\nProvide the option for VitaDAO, in partnership with Vitality Healthspan Foundation, to spend up to $1M USD of VitaDAO's treasury on equity investments. Investments would be expected to be within the $50-100K range such that at least 10 investments could be made. Investments would also be expected to be in seed stage or at the latest Series A companies to maintain the focus on early stage asset formation and maximize VitaDAO's ownership stake.\n\n\nFor more information, please see [the phase 2 proposal and discussion on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-27-1m-more-for-equity-investments/529).",

      "title": "VDP-23 [Governance] VitaDAO IP Holding Company",
      "content": "This is a proposal to form an IP holding company for VitaDAO. \n\n# Motivation\n\nThere are two reasons to form an IP holding company for VitaDAO: \n\n1. To hold existing soft IP (copyrights, logo trademarks and word marks) related to VitaDAO\n2. To hold future hard IP (patents) related to VitaDAO \n\n# Specification\n\n*Project Lead*\nSavva, Jesse \n\n*Team*\nLegal working group\n\nThe IP holding company is intended to hold only that which cannot yet be held in IP NFTs.\n\nThe potential advantages of forming an IP holding for VitaDAO company are:\n\n1. Stronger legal protection for VitaDAO’s IP in general.\n\n2. For soft IP: provides an entity with which VitaDAO can more easily (i) litigate against IP appropriators, e.g. someone who spins up an unauthorized VitaDAO merchandise store or otherwise uses VitaDAO works, logo, and name for unathorized commercial gain and (ii) license the soft IP for commercial use. \n\n3. For hard IP: an entity prepared to assign patents when patents arise from VitaDAO-funded projects; an entity to fundraise into from traditional investors interested in IP only; an entity for patent licensing royalties; an entity with which VitaDAO can defensively litigate against entities that might try to attack VitaDAO with their own patents.\n\nThe potential disadvantages of forming an IP holding company for VitaDAO company are:\n\n1. An off-chain solution shifts focus from designing for on-chain IP holding solutions, e.g. IP NFTs.\n\n2. Administrative overhead from forming ($3,000-100,000+) and maintaining the company (from $1,000 to $10,000 p/a), depending on the jurisdiction, is significant and the hard IP will take time to generate. Our preference would be to first form and maintain in a cost-effective and flexible jurisdiction then move to a new jurisdiction if and when needed.\n\nWhile hard IP can be sexy and very valuable, soft IP should not be overlooked. Our resident IP lawyer Savva wrote in the legal working group channel, “If your value is in your network, you need a way to shut down scammers and others trying to imply sponsorship / association when they don't have it (e.g. posting VitaDAO name or logo on their website).”\n\nFinally, the concept of using IP holding companies is not new to web3. For example, Uniswap uses Universal Navigation Inc. (which also holds the IP to most of its code) to hold its trademarks. \n\n# Implementation\n\nThe legal working group will evaluate and decide on a jurisdiction and form of entity.\n\n*Timeline*\n2-4 weeks \n\n*Sucess Metrics*\nSuccess = holding company formed + IP assigned to HoldCo\n\nFor more information, please see [the phase 2 proposal and discussion on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-23-vitadao-ip-holding-company/510).",

      "title": "VDP-19 Stewardship Process",
      "content": "This proposal introduces a new process for onboarding and offboarding working group stewards for more transparency and accountability. \n\n# Summary\nThe role of a working group steward is crucial to the success of a working group and VitaDAO as a whole. To introduce more transparency and accountability, I am proposing a process for onboarding and offboarding stewards. A new steward should be nominated by another steward and voted in by working group members. Token holders can vote to offboard an existing steward.  \n\n# Motivation\nWorking groups are the backbone of VitaDAO. They are coordinating expert contributions and refining proposals on behalf of VITA holders. Each working group is led by one or two [steward](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/what-are-working-group-stewards/482)s who usually grow into that position by contributing work of great quality to their working group for a longer period of time. This process, however, has not yet been defined and formalised. We need a formalised process of onboarding as well as offboarding working group stewards that is easy to understand and transparent.\n\n# Specification\nI propose the following processes.\n\n## Onboarding as a new Steward\n\nA new steward is onboarded through the following process:\n\n### Option A\n\n1. Any steward can nominate anyone as a new steward.\n2. Once a new steward is nominated, any [Vitacore](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/what-is-vitacore/481) member can challenge the nomination within a week.\n3. If the nomination isn’t challenged, members of all working groups vote on the nomination in the Discord channel #cross-wg-chat.\n4. If a majority of votes is in agreement, the nominated steward is offered the position.\n5. If the nominated steward accepts, they are officially onboarded as a steward.\n\n## Offboarding as an existing Steward\n\nAn existing steward is offboarded through **one of** the following processes:\n\n### Option A\n1. In a vote necessarily recurring every six months, members of all working groups vote on whether the steward should remain in place in an anonymous poll on Discord or Discourse.\n2. If a majority of members of all working groups do not confirm the steward, the steward is offboarded.\n\nOR\n\n### Option B\n1. In a vote optionally occurring at any time, members of all working groups vote on whether the steward should remain in place in an anonymous poll on Discord or Discourse.\n2. If a majority of members of all working groups do not confirm the steward, the steward is offboarded.\n\nOR\n\n### Option C\n1. VITA token holders vote to offboard the steward in a phase 3 vote (Discourse + Snapshot).\n2. If the Snapshot vote passes, the steward is offboarded.\n\nOR\n\n### Option D\n1. Another steward nominates the steward for offboarding.\n2. If a member of Vitacore does not challenge the nomination within a week, the steward is offboarded.\n\nOR\n\n### Option E\n1. The steward chooses to offboard themselves and gives notice at least two weeks in advance.\n2. After the end of the notice period, the steward is offboarded.\n\n\n## Notes and soft requirements\n* A prospective steward should be mission aligned, have proven their domain expertise in the corresponding working group and bring leadership qualities.\n* A prospective steward should have the support from their working group as well as a good working relationship with the other stewards.\n* A new steward should see the first month as a trial period.\n* A steward is accountable to the VitaDAO community and should act accordingly.\n* A steward must adhere to the code of conduct.\n* A steward must not be absent for a longer period of time without giving a reasonable explanation.\n* An offboarded steward should remain available as a point of contact for at least two months, except if personal circumstances do not permit this.\n\nThis process is adapted from the Token Engineering Commons (TEC)’s [Community Stewards WG Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cqdURiW7Qv50J_Ha9FLr9IvdqnZGuhlsffL6O1ivHnA/edit#).\n\n# Implementation\nThis proposal will be updated in response to comments and discussions in this thread. Once the finalised proposal has passed on Snapshot, the ‘Specification’ section above will serve as a template for onboarding and offboarding stewards with immediate effect.\n\nFor more information, please see [the phase 2 proposal and discussion on Discourse](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-19-stewardship-process/479).\n\n",

Purchasing VITA on DEXs is impossible for these entities or in this volume. Working group members believe it would be beneficial to grow the DAO treasury and include these entities. \n\n# Specification\nWe propose to split this decision into multiple proposals.\n\n**Decision in VDP-11: Does VitaDAO want to mint an additional 10% of tokens, bringing total circulating supply to 40%?**\n\n# Implementation\nIn a first step, these tokens would be transferred to a ringfenced multisig, with its sole purpose to enable treasury growing transactions with entities approved by VITA holders.\n\nOnce this decision is made, working group members and VitaDAO community could engage those entities and 1) prepare an institutional raise and 2) prepare a whitelisted on-chain auction. In either case, we propose these newly issued tokens are vesting. If the decision is no then the DAO expends no further energy here and we continue as is.\n\n[More info and discussion on potential next steps](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/continuing-the-discussion-what-happens-after-vdp-11/512) that are beyond the scope of VDP-11 and not part of this proposal.\n\nVitalians sit at the helm of a global neo-longevity renaissance - within months, our network has attracted some of the brightest minds in the field and we are just beginning.

      "content": "Ethereum mainnet fees are high, and to make participation in VitaDAO easier, we propose to bridge VITA to Polygon and Gnosis Chain.\n\n## Summary \n\nUsers demand cheaper ways to participate in VITA, and governance. I propose that we experimentally explore bridging some small amount of $VITA owned by the DAO to the most used side-chains and layer 2s. Starting with Polygon and GnosisChain due to highest adoption, and later potentially Arbitrum, Optimism, Zksync and others.\n\n## Details\n\nTo ensure enough liquidity i'd propose budgeting $250k worth of $VITA and $250k worth of ETH to start with, to basically have one https://balancer.exchange/ pool on Polygon with $300k in total liquidity, and one https://sushi.com/ pool on Gnosis Chain with $200k in liquidity.\n\nTo ensure that the price of $VITA is similar on Polygon and Gnosis Chain compared to Ethereum I'd propose additional $50k worth of VITA +ETH on Polygon and Gnosis Chain each, controlled by the VitaDAO multi-sig with a bot buying or selling to ensure the prices are synchronized.  \n\n**Implementation**: Transferring total of 600k worth VITA/ETH ($300k in VITA, $300k in ETH) to Polygon/GnosisChain\n- Transferring 350k worth of VITA/ETH (50-50) to VitaDAOs polygon multisig\n- Transferring 250k worth of VITA/ETH (50-50) to VitaDAOs gnosis chain multisig\n\nAdditionally the tokenomics working group would suggest allocating $100k worth of VITA in rewards for providing liquidity on Balancer/Polygon (~$60k), and Sushi/GnosisChain (~40k) for the first year, which is fairly low considering the DAO would earn back a majority of these rewards by being a main liquidity provider.\n\nFor more information, please see the phase 2 proposal and discussion on Discourse: https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-20-vitadao-liquidity-pools-on-layer2s-polygon-gnosis-chain-etc/483",

No snapshot vote occurred.*\n\n### Summary\nWe suggest improving parts of VDP-1 to improve our governance processes. Next to a more flexible phase 1, we propose a new template and more transparency during phase 2, as well as a new 7-day vote in batches during phase 3. Authors of successful proposals should follow up with a retrospective.\n\n### Proposal Details\n\n#### Motivation\n[VDP-1 VitaDAO Governance Framework](https://snapshot.org/#/vote.vitadao.eth/proposal/0x41b8a306636fc155b3637bfbf2be0060ee57f2ba6a4ae8d8e90540eccee15706) was a tremendous milestone as it gave birth to the DAO-part of VitaDAO and enabled us all to discuss, decide and move forward in a systematic and decentralised, yet also straightforward and efficient way. Since the framework was adopted two months ago, it was put to the test by many community members which resulted in six on-chain votes and many more soft governance decisions.\n\nTwo months later, we have a sense of where we can do better. Our diverse community of longevity researchers and blockchain enthusiasts with >100 accounts on our Discourse and >500 wallets holding VITA expressed various concerns where the governance process was unintuitive, complicated or inflexible. This proposal is to amend VDP-1 with several specific points while keeping the tried and trusted parts in place.\n\n#### Specification\n#### a) Phase 1: More Flexibility\n[Corresponding section in VDP-1](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40#phase-1-ideation-14)\n\nThe governance working group suggests allowing more options for phase 1 proposals to move to phase 2.\n\nMoving forward, phase 1 can be completed\n\n* as a thread in the ‘Ideas’ category on Discourse, or\n* as a message in a channel on Discord, or\n* as a message in a group chat on Discord\nwhereas a phase 1 proposal is considered passed once it has received support from five individuals\n\n* through comments/responses or\n* through likes/emoji reactions.\n\n#### b) Phase 2: Aligning the Specifications with On-Chain Proposals\n[Corresponding section in VDP-1](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40#phase-2-specification-17)\n\nThe governance working group suggests changing the template for phase 2 proposals to match the template of phase 3.\n\nMoving forward, phase 2 proposals should be structured as follows:\n\n* Title → 30-60 characters\n* Summary → 200-400 characters in one paragraph\n* Details → any length, any formatting, can include images and hyperlinks, must include sections on motivation, specification and implementation\n* Single-choice poll with the options “Agree”, “Agree with revisions (please comment)”, and “Disagree”, as described in VDP-1\n\n#### c) Phase 2: Fostering Informed Decisions\n[Corresponding section in VDP-1](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40#phase-2-specification-17)\n\nThe governance working group suggests introducing measures that make it easier for community members to make an informed decision without requiring an unreasonable amount of their time.\n\nThis should include an impact assessment conducted by a working group member who is not the proposal author or part of their team. The impact assessment should flag notable details, including high budgets, fundamental changes of rules and other extraordinary measures.\n\nMoreover, we suggest a mandatory live event, such as an Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) on a conference call, for all proposals before their details are finalised for phase 3. The respective proposal author is responsible for organising this event.\n\n#### d) Phase 3: Shortening the Duration\n[Corresponding section in VDP-1](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40#phase-3-duration-14-days-25)\n\nThe governance working group suggests reducing the voting duration of phase 3 votes from 14 days to 7 days, as well as the voting delay period from 48h to 12h.\n\n#### e) Phase 3: Batches\n[Corresponding section in VDP-1](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-1-vitadao-governance-framework/40#phase-3-duration-14-days-25)\n\nThe governance working group suggests uploading phase 3 proposals in batches.\n\nThis should be seen as the default way to operate, given that voting on several proposals at the same time provides a much better experience to the user than voting once every other week.\n\nIt should also merely be seen as a recommendation and time-sensitive proposals may still be uploaded on chain immediately once they qualify for phase 3. If that should be the case, we suggest that proposal authors include a prominent remark in their phase 2 proposal.\n\n#### f) Post-Phase 3: Retrospectives\nNo corresponding section in VDP-1\n\nThe governance working group suggests introducing a social contract for proposal authors to report back whether and how their successful proposal was implemented in the form of a retrospective.\n\nThe author should revisit the motivation described in the phase 3 proposal and reflect on whether and how the situation has improved. In particular, such a report should provide an analysis of how the provided funds have been used, as well as which parts of the proposal have been implemented and which have not been.\n\nLastly, the retrospective should include a short summary with the next steps, both as part of ongoing work as part of this proposal as well as recommended action items that the author considers to be outside the scope of this proposal.\n\nRetrospectives should be published as a thread on Discourse in the corresponding working group section no later than at the end of the next quarter following the end of the on-chain vote.\n\n#### More information\nFor the full proposal with more details, see the discussion on [Discourse here](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-12-vitadao-governance-framework-amendment-1/374).",

No snapshot vote occurred.*\n\n### Summary\nWhile VitaDAO already receives tremendous support, we should put a more structured system around incentives and rewards in place that contribute towards the mission of VitaDAO. This proposal is about such incentives for contributors, researchers and developers in particular.\n\n### Proposal Details\n#### Incentives across the protocol\n\n* Main goal is to advance the purpose of the DAO of funding high quality early stage longevity research and collecting valuable intellectual property.\n* Incentives should help to advance these goals by incentivising top contributors and stakeholders to contribute effectively and advance the overall mission.\n* The details of the numbers, execution would be led/decided by Tokenomics and Longevity WG with Input from Core WG and inputs from Discourse and Discord.\n\n#### For Contributors\n\n* ~$50-80 VITA per hour as benchmark: range should be based on common pay specific to task: eg. moderating discord would be ~40, longevity, legal or web development ~120, and later modified upon knowing VITA price post-launch).\n* Re-adjust post-launch based on token price and feedback.\n* Tasks/Hours should be agreed upon with working group stewards and tracked by the contributors. Each working group steward could move to a more open, decentralized list of outstanding tasks and delegating ownership of them.\n\n#### For Researchers\n\nResearchers are key stakeholders for VitaDAO to thrive long-term, and also the one that clearly need incentives because many might not be onboarded onto Ethereum and might also have limited access to and availability of tokens.\n\n* ~$150 VITA (Airdrop) for Researchers and people working in longevity who join and potentially contribute through a survey or something similar with feedback/input or apply as longevity delegate voters (pays for time, gas and involves them)… (vetted, limited to maybe 350-500 Researchers).\n* ~$100 VITA for Selected Researchers voting on Longevity Funding Proposals (incentive and paying for gas).\n* ~$400-550 VITA for proposing the funding of specific research that passes the longevity board to be voted upon by DAO (in 2yr vested VITA).\n* ~$500-800 VITA if the proposal for funding goes through by being accepted for funding by the DAO (in 2yr vested VITA).\n* ~$500-1000 VITA for (~2-5) select longevity IP evaluation board members to do a write-up for a decision.\n* ~0,5% of proposed IP sale/licensing amount for the one proposing it and making it happen (in 2yr vested VITA or USDC/ETH?).\n* ~1%+ of IP sale/licensing for referring a buyer/licensee? (in 2yr vested VITA).\n* ~1%+ of IP sale/licensing for the initiator of proposal (in 2yr vested VITA).\n\n#### Bounties for Developers\n\nDevelopers are key to ensure that the overall structure works safely. Proposal to incentivise people proof-reading the smart contracts for an incentive and another incentive if they find flaws.\n\n##### High threat: up to $50,000\n\n* Changing the owner address of the authentication contract as well as adding a solver without authorization.\n* Forgery of a user’s signature that would allow to execute a funded trade without the consent of the user.\n* Execute arbitrary settlements without being a solver.\n* Executing a user’s trade that is expired or at a price worse than the limit price (also as a solver).\n* Transferring in tokens more than once for the same fill-or-kill order in the same settlement (also as a solver).\n* Access to user funds outside of a trade.\n\n##### Medium threat: up to $10,000\n\n* Changing the order of a legitimate interaction, as well as skipping one, in a settlement.\n* Removing a solver without authorization (also as a solver).\n* Making the contract unable to be operated by any solver, e.g., through self-destruction (also as a solver).\n\n##### Low threat: up to $1,000\n\n* Freeing storage without being a solver.\n* Invalidate an order without the permission of the user who created it.\n\n#### Open Competition\n\n* ~50-150 VITA: Open Community Competition for best proposals, explainers/threads of VitaDAO and other similarly valuable community inputs.\n\n#### More information\nFor the full proposal with more details, see the discussion on [Discourse here](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-2-vitadao-incentive-proposal/45).",

No snapshot vote occurred.*\n\n### Summary\nA best practice among many successful crypto projects that have survived so-called \"crypto winters\" is to have an appropriate treasury strategy. VitaDAO currently holds a mix of VITA, Ether and stablecoins. Here, a strategy is proposed, along actionable steps as well as rules how and to what extent the tokenomics working group may take decisions on their own on further actions depending on market trends and the DAO's needs.\n\n### Proposal Details\nThe goal of our treasury strategy should be to sustainably grow our assets and ensure funding for research projects and operations. I'd propose that tokenomics stewards and working group will take autonomous stewardship of treasury strategy with input from the community, as well as core working groups, and only put to an onchain vote bigger strategic changes of our strategy. The WG would take input from all community and working group members into consideration, but most importantly the financial needs for funding longevity projects. [Live update of our treasury on Zerion](https://app.zerion.io/0xf5307a74d1550739ef81c6488dc5c7a6a53e5ac2/overview).\n\n#### Stablecoins vs tokens reallocation over ~12 months\n\nOver time it would rebalance some Ethereum towards USDC in anticipation of needed funding for longevity projects, or into more specific more productive assets like staked ETH, vaults etc. once they see fit. One allocation model could be:\n\n* ~20-30% stable coins and\n* ~70-80% ETH and Defi tokens\n\n#### Stablecoin allocation\n\nSome longer term stablecoins could be placed into a yearn vaults that earn us APY on top of our stables and potentially insured through Nexus Mutual.\n\n#### ETH + DeFi token allocation\n\n* move ~40-60% of our ETH to liquid ETH2 tokens such as Lido stETH2 to generate 6-10% yield in ETH.\n* move 10-25% to DeFi index like Indexed Finance or Pie DAO which also earns yield on top.\n\n#### Liquidity Pool\n\nI'd propose that VitaDAO would set up a Balancer LP Pool with ~$1m of Vita<>ETH Liquidity.\n\n#### Summary\n\nAllocate our ETH for example:\n\n* 20-45% crv stEth with Curve and Lido | ~9.5%+ interest\n* 15-30% ETH <> sETH liquidity pool with StakeWise and similar | ~20% yield\n* ~10-15% ETH <> DeFi Index Token with Indexed Finance or Pie DAO etc. | ~35%+ yield\n* 25-35% kept in ETH\n\n#### More information\nFor the full proposal with more details, see the discussion on [Discourse here](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-4-vitadao-treasury-lp-proposal/186).",

No snapshot vote occurred.*\n\n### Summary\nThis proposal is to decide if VitaDAO will do equity deals (i.e. fund startups) in addition to IP-NFT deals (i.e. acquire a project's IP). This would enable participation in opportunities at a more advanced stage that have already obtained validation of their commercial prospects independent of VitaDAO. In essence, they are safer bets.\n\n### Proposal Details\nWe are in advanced talks with several startups the Longevity WG team is excited about.\n\n#### Rationale\nSome of the most exciting areas in longevity, such as in cellular reprogramming, are already at the company stage. Therefore, focusing solely on academic projects will put VitaDAO behind the curve. Our main focus is on making a difference in the real-world, so we propose funding companies closer to making that vision possible.\n\nEquity and startup deals provide a measure of valuation well understood in the marketplace that can gain VitaDAO exposure and help drive up the DAO’s credibility.\n\nFurthermore, participating in equity deals alongside traditional investors will enable us to foster closer relationships with those who may eventually be purchasers of IP-NFTs. For the companies we fund, this will mean access to this growing network of VCs, incubators, operators, etc. Everyone benefits.\n\nWhat’s unique about VitaDAO is our passionate, engaged community of longevists. This enables us to add value to the Fund’s portfolio companies in unique ways compared to traditional funding sources. Our community can help companies with not only the science, but also in growing awareness – creating value for both the companies and VitaDAO itself.\n\n#### Risks\nEven though IP-NFT deals will be at an earlier stage and riskier (since most academic projects don’t make it to the company stage), equity and startup deals are still subject to investment risk, including possible loss of the principal amount invested.\n\n#### Specification\nThe amount proposed for VitaDAO to invest in a fund for equity deals is $1.5M.\n\nWhile the industry standard fund fee structure is a 2% annual management fee and a 20% carried interest, this fund proposes a favorable fee structure of a 0.1% one-time management fee to cover setup costs and a 8% carried interest.\n\n#### More information\nFor the full proposal with more details, see the discussion on [Discourse here](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-7-equity-startup-deals-proposal/325).",

No snapshot vote occurred.*\n\n### Summary\nAgeing is associated with the decline in the capacity of the autophagy pathway to degrade dysfunctional and damaging cellular components, such as protein aggregates and mitochondria. Dysfunctional autophagy, in turn, undermines other cellular functions including DNA repair, metabolism and survival. Therefore, activation of autophagy is considered a promising therapeutic approach to combat ageing and age-related diseases. A large number of screens has been performed and published to date, these have identified a wide range of small molecules that stimulate initiation of autophagy. Prof. Korolchuck lab proposes to initiate a drug discovery programme with the aim of identifying novel bioactive autophagy inducers.\n\n### Proposal Details\n\n#### Problem\nLysosomal dysfunction is an important factor contributing to the reduction of autophagy during aging. As dysfunctional lysosomes interfere with autophagy at the terminal stage, stimulation of autophagy initiation can be ineffective to rescue autophagy. Additionally, current methods to measure autophagy are rather unreliable, slow, and with complicated readouts, making the screening of compounds that promote autophagy less efficient.\n\n#### Opportunity\nTo model lysosomal dysfunction, Prof. Korolchuk lab uses cells with a mutation in a lysosomal protein (Npc1) associated with neurodegenerative diseases. When these cells are subjected to metabolic stress, they suffer cell death due to dysfunctional autophagy, providing an easy readout for an autophagy assay (cells dead/cells alive). To identify true autophagy activators, Prof. Korolchuk lab uses cells that lack initiation of autophagy and are therefore not rescuable by autophagy inducers in parallel with Npc1 KO cells.\n\nIf funded by VitaDAO, Prof. Korolchuk lab will use this innovative method to screen an unique library of natural compounds, synthesize derivatives based on hits and identify their biological target.\n\n#### Highlights\n* Assay with easy readout, decent throughput, good controls and targeting one of the most important processes in cellular aging (autophagy)\n* Solid evidence supporting their approach\n* Small ticket size ($150000-$250000)\n* The platform would allow collaboration with other projects targeting autophagy/mitophagy\n* Potential for generation of IP/NFT for compounds coming out of their screening platform\n* Strong and productive scientific team interested in the IP/NFT model and in company formation\n\n#### Risks\n* Current application relies on the screening of their current library of natural compounds producing hits, contingency plan needs to be planned with Prof. Korolchuk lab\n* The screening model relies on rescuing autophagy in a single knockout model. A risk would be that they could be screening to solve a problem caused by this specific knockout that, although linked with some neurodegenerative diseases, lacked relevance in general aging. However, the team is working on addressing such risk and there are promising data suggesting this might not be a problem.\n\n\n#### Outcome of the evaluation and recommendation\nA total of 4 evaluators independently scored the project proposal on different categories as either: (1) Oustanding, (2) Strong, (3) Satisfactory, (4) Weak, (5) Unacceptable, (N/A) Not enough information provided, or (N/A) Not my area of expertise.

Dysfunctional autophagy, in turn, undermines other cellular functions including DNA repair, metabolism and survival. Therefore, activation of autophagy is considered a promising therapeutic approach to combat ageing and age-related diseases. A large number of screens has been performed and published to date, these have identified a wide range of small molecules that stimulate initiation of autophagy.\n\nHowever, lysosomal dysfunction is one of the prominent factors contributing to ageing and a driver of many age-related pathologies. In the presence of dysfunctional lysosomes, the autophagy pathway becomes blocked at the terminal stage. As such stimulation of autophagy initiation may not always be an effective approach to induce the flux through the system. We model this situation using cells with a mutation in a lysosomal protein Npc1 (mutations of which are associated with Niemann-Pick type C1 Disease and Parkinson’s Disease), which leads to the block in autophagosome degradation ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3957429/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3957429/)).\n\n#### Project Summary\nExtensive work leading to this proposal identified a unique phenotype of cells with dysfunctional autophagy in tissue culture ([https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-659023/v1](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-659023/v1), [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.928424v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.928424v1), under revision for Nat Cell Biol). In normal glucose-containing medium autophagy KOs upregulate glycolysis at the expense of mitochondrial respiration. When glucose is replaced with galactose, which results in zero net ATP production through glycolysis and cells are forced to respire, autophagy deficient cells become apoptotic. This phenotype is common for Npc1 KO MEFs where autophagosome maturation is impaired as well as for cells with the loss of core autophagy genes (Atg5, Atg7 and FIP200/Rb1cc1).\n\nWe established the sequence of events leading to cell death of autophagy deficient cells: 1) accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria; 2) stress in the form of increased ROS and DNA damage; 3) activation of stress response pathways (NADases of Sirtuin and PARP family); 4) depletion of cellular NAD+ (and NADH) pools; 4) mitochondrial depolarisation; 5) apoptotic cascade. Our data with yeast, fly, and human stem cell-derived neuronal models of autophagy deficiency indicate that the mechanisms of cell death described in MEFs is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to humans ([https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-659023/v1](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-659023/v1), [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.928424v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.31.928424v1)).\n\nTargeting the processes downstream of autophagy dysfunction (mitochondrial dysfunction, hyperactivity of NADases, NAD boosting, mitochondrial re-polarisation) can rescue cell death in cells/organisms with both the genetic loss of Atg genes and Npc1. On the other hand, autophagy inducers can rescue autophagy block and cell survival in Npc1 cells, whilst in Atg5 KO cells true autophagy inducers are not able to rescue autophagy or cell death. This provides us with an opportunity for a unique and rapid high throughput cell death-based screening system. Compounds that are capable of activating autophagy and overriding the autophagy block in Npc1 KO cells rescue cell death, whilst their dependence on functional autophagy is indicated by the lack of effect in Atg5 KO cells.\n\nAdditionally, we generated and optimised for HTS wild type or Npc1 KO MEFs with an inducible tet-on-tet-off expression of a luciferase-tagged autophagy flux reporter p62. As a proof of principle, we performed a screen using a library of FDA-approved drugs, provided by the Newcastle High Throughput Facility. The screen produced 12 small molecules previously not known as autophagy inducers that effectively activated autophagy flux. Finally, we generated and optimised wild type or Npc1 KO cells stably expressing “traffic-light” EGFP-RFP-LC3 for high throughput high content screening. Both platforms will be used for secondary/tertiary screening purposes.\n\nWe propose to initiate a drug discovery programme with the aim of identifying novel bioactive autophagy inducers.\n\n#### Team\nViktor Korolchuk (VK), cell biology, Newcastle University, UK; Jóhannes Reynisson (JR), drug discovery, Keele University, UK; and Konstantin Volcho (KPV), organic and medicinal chemistry, Novosibirsk Institute of Organic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\n#### Next Steps\nKVP lab collected 1000+ compounds initially isolated from rare plant and animal species from northern Russia and have a unique expertise in the synthesis of these compounds and their structural derivatives.\n\nThis is a virgin collection that has never been tested for its effect on autophagy and, combined with the natural occurrence of these molecules and therefore bioavailability, it increases the chances of successful hit identification. In addition to chemical synthesis, KVP also brings in vivo testing capacity, subject to initial identification of drug leads as outlined below.\n\nWe will initially test a small (~200) collection of compounds which are readily available and represent a diverse chemical variety present in the library. The hits from the initial screen will be processed through secondary/tertiary readouts. Lead molecules will be identified by testing structurally similar derivatives of the hits identified in the KVP collection by our long-term collaborator JR and synthesised by KVP staff for structural verification, followed by validation of their effect on autophagy in several standard assays building a preliminary structure activity relationship (SAR).\n\nOur follow up aim will be to establish the specificity of these and other small molecules from the screens, identify their cellular targets (though Samsara platform), and characterise their mechanism of action in autophagy. We will also investigate the potential of these molecules to alleviate cellular defects caused by lysosomal dysfunction (e.g. mitochondrial deficit, DNA damage, increased sensitivity to stress and cell death) using human fibroblasts and neurons. In parallel, we will test a focused collections of small molecules based on the structure of our lead compounds to establish a robust SAR for future translation into preclinical models.\n\n#### Budget\n*Identification of lead compounds:*\n\n1. Screen a diverse library of naturally occurring bioactive compounds (~200) in cell survival assays (Atg5 vs Npc1 KO) 🡪 dose response effect (VK) (£5,000, 2 months including optimisation and set up)\n2.

In parallel (2 months):\n    * Synthesis of derivatives for 3-5 hit series, ~12 each (JR, KPV) (£10,000);\n    * Additional autophagy assays (autophagic cargo degradation; flux assays; imaging-based determination of autophagy induction; testing an involvement of known signalling pathways) (VK) (£5,000)\n5. Lead series determined by screening (VK) (£2,000, 2 months)\n6. In parallel (2 months):\n    * Second round of synthesis based on lead series ~12 derivatives (KPV, JR) (£3,000);\n    * Testing the ability of lead compounds to alleviate cellular defects caused by lysosomal dysfunction (e.g. mitochondrial deficit, DNA damage, increased sensitivity to stress and cell death) (VK) (£5,000);\n    * Determination of biological target (Samsara)\n7. Screening of derivatives, SAR determination, identification of drug leads (KPV, JR, VK) (£3,000, 1 month)\n\nTotal: 12-month postdoc + running costs - £80,000\n\n*Future work subject to successful screening:*\n\n8. ADMET, DMPK profile determined in mouse models, (KPV) (Total £16,600, 4 Months)\n    * Pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, excretion (£3,300)\n    * Routes of administration: PO, IV – (£3,300)\n    * Preliminary tox studies (dose-range finding, MTD) (£10,000)\n9. IP sought for drug candidate(s) 🡪 patent\n\nTTO overhead (20-60%) is not included in the current budget and might increase the ticket size up to $250000\n\n*Contingency:*\n\n10. Back up screen as required (1000+ natural bioactive compounds can be synthesised and screened) (KPV and VK)\n\n#### More information\nFor the full proposal with more details, see the discussion on [Discourse here](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-16-korolchuk-lab-autophagy-activators-funding-proposal/451).\n",

No snapshot vote occurred.*\n\n### Summary\nProposal for VitaDAO to donate $64,299 USDC to match donations for longevity research initiatives through a quadratic donation round on Gitcoin in early December.\n\n### Proposal Details\n\nIn collaboration with Gitcoin, VitaDAO should co-organize a donation round for longevity-related projects in early December. The donation round would utilise quadratic funding which tackles 3 the tragedy of the commons, a common problem with public goods such as funding longevity research. As part of this donation round, VitaDAO should provide 64,299 USDC as a matching donor.\n\nThe goal is to advance longevity research beyond our core focus of directly funding research with intellectual property. We are collaborating with Gitcoin to advance unique ways to fund research through crypto and by the crypto community.\n\nIndividuals like Vitalik Buterin, Glen Weyl and others proposed a system called quadratic funding, where some donors quadratically match donations from other donors. This results in a situation where individual donors may spend just as much as it benefits themselves, but due to these matching donations, effectively cause a total spend that takes into account the benefit of others. For more information on how quadratic funding works, see [this blog post by Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/12/07/quadratic.html) as well as [“WTF is Quadratic Funding?”](https://wtfisqf.com/).\n\nGitcoin proved this in practice, funding projects with millions of dollars already. As a pioneer in quadratic funding with experience from previous donation rounds and a high-profile network of donors, Gitcoin is the ideal partner for VitaDAO to organize a donation round specifically for longevity-related projects.\n\n#### Specification\nThe VitaDAO Longevity Working Group has curated a list of 15-30 projects that seem like a good fit for this donation round. The curation process focused on smaller, relatively underfunded initiatives that could benefit a lot from additional funding.\n\nThe suggested amount of donating $64,299 to this round follows the time in minutes that Jeanne Calment, the oldest known human to have lived, has been alive.\n\n#### Implementation and Timeline\nBy the end of November, the project list will be finalized and sent to Gitcoin. The funding round is set to start on Dec 1st, 2021 and last for 2 weeks.\n\n#### Budget\nThe budget of 64,299 USDC represents a donation from VitaDAO as a matching funder to Gitcoin’s Quadratic Funding Round in December 2021.\n\n#### Explainer\n[Youtube Quadratic Voting Explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJljTtLnymE)\n\n#### More information\nFor the full proposal with more details, see the discussion on [Discourse here](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-13-vitadao-gitcoin-quadratic-funding-proposal/431).",

No snapshot vote occurred.*\n\n### Summary\nCrowd Funded Cures' mission is to implement pay-for-success smart contracts (an on-chain version of Social Impact Bonds or SIBs) to incentivise repurposing of generic drugs. The SIB mechanism incentivises impact investors (such as VitaDAO token holders) to fund IPNFTs holding encrypted Phase II/III randomised controlled trial (RCT) data to sell to payers in exchange for outcome payments or a subsidized price for the newly labelled generic from a generic drug repurposing fund if the RCT is successful and/or the repurposed generic obtains regulatory approval. The fund can also be crowdfunded from the public using disease-specific NFTs or backed by payers such as governments, health insurers, or large philanthropy. We propose VitaDAO provide $40,000 of funding to Crowd Funded Cures to commission a feasibility study from Guidehouse or another leading consulting firm on this new model of research funding (\"generic drug and nutraceutical repurposing pay-for-success contracts\") to kickstart potential future mechanisms that VitaDAO could support in the future.\n\n### Proposal Details\n\n#### Problem: What problem is this solving? Why?\nThere are over 20,000 generic drugs with FDA approval and even more nutraceuticals which lack private incentives for repurposing because it is impossible to enforce a monopoly price if the drug is available for a large off-patent indication, which means it is not possible to prevent off-label competition. In essence, dosing information about which generic drugs work for new indications, in which patients, and at which stage of a disease, is a non-rivalrous and non-excludable public good which causes a “tragedy of the commons”.\n\nMost known longevity drugs are also generic or off-patent (e.g. metformin, rapamycin, resveratrol, NMN etc), without evidence from large RCTs to determine optimal safety and efficacy due to this market failure. Public and philanthropic grant funding for generic drug repurposing suffers from many disadvantages, including centralisation, inefficiency, lack of innovation, exposure to risk of RCT failure and risk of cronyism and nepotism.\n\nBy contrast, pay-for-success does not suffer from these disadvantages. In particular, it is decentralised / meritocratic, transfers risk of RCT failure from payers to impact investors who are willing to bear this risk, and leverages market forces, with impact investors most likely to fund successful RCTs - forming syndicates and/or aggregating VITA tokens - which increases their value.\n\n#### Success: How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?\nEstablishing the world’s first pilot pay-for-success (PFS) smart contract using IPNFTs to incentivise repurposing of generic drugs to treat a specific disease (e.g. Covid, longevity, pancreatic cancer) and raise impact investor funds of $1-10m to conduct Phase 2 or 3 RCT data encrypted as a trade secret in the IPNFT until unlocked by payers. Launch to wider community to obtain syndicate of payers or crowdfund outcome payment fund or advance market commitments $10-50m. After the pilot PFS / IPNFT smart contract validates the concept, expand into new use cases/diseases and raise larger fund from payers (e.g. health insurers, govts, philanthropy, community - $10-100m).\n\n#### When: When does it ship and what are the milestones?\n* Nov 2021 - Jan 2022 - Launch of pilot pay-for-success smart contract and NFT fundraiser with associated public good medicine IPNFTs available for investment by VitaDAO community.\n* Jan - May 2022 - publication of Guidehouse Feasibility Study with financial model to support payer backing for pay-for-success model on the basis of health impact and drug cost savings.\n* Jan - June 2022 - conduct fundraising campaign for public and payer backing of NFT fund for generic drug repurposing in specific disease class (e.g. longevity, Covid etc). Target $5m to incentivise successful Phase 2 RCT and $10-15m to incentivise Phase 3 clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for new indication.\n\n#### Budget\n* $40k to support Guidehouse Feasibility Study to payers to back a pay for success contract on the basis of overall costs savings or lower costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) compared with patented drugs.\n* To be determined (another vote will be needed to authorize the allocation of additional funds) - time and materials to support development of pilot generic drug and nutraceutical repurposing pay-for-success smart contract, open source medicine IPNFT, and Results Oracle linking to RCT data provided by independent CRO.\n\nTeam Members\n* Project Lead: Savva Kerdemelidis [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/savvak/)\n* Amir Amraie, MPharmS, COO, Crowd Funded Cures [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amiramraie/)\n* Andrew Horton, CKA, CTO, Crowd Funded Cures [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewhortonsecurity/) [Github](https://github.com/urbanadventurer)\n* Spyridon Antonopoulos, PhD, Partnerships Advisor, Crowd Funded Cures Associate Director in Financial Services, Guidehouse [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spiroantonopoulos/)\n* Nicholas Fiorenza, MSc Molecular Medicine, Strategic Advisor & Business Development, Crowd Funded Cures [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholascharlesfiorenza/)\n* Tovah Wolf, PhD, MS, RDN, LDN, Nutritional Advisor, Crowd Funded Cures [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tovahwolf/)\n* Edward Kahn, Strategic Advisor, Crowd Funded Cures, Founding Partner, Rediscovery Life Sciences, Director, Strategic Business Development, Cures within Reach [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ed-kahn-81b26b3/)\n* Dr Steven Biglesen, Medical Advisor, Crowd Funded Cures Physician, Assistant Clinical Professor, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-bigelsen-57b79698/)\n* Dr Michael Tombros, BSc(Hons), BM, FRACGP, FRNZCGP, PGDipOccMed, MAvMed(Dist), Medical Advisor, Crowd Funded Cures, Physician [Linked In](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-tombros-91122a17/)\n\n#### More information\nFor the full proposal with more details, see the discussion on [Discourse here](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-17-crowdfundedcures-org-partnership-proposal-generic-drug-repurposing-social-impact-bond/459).\n",

No snapshot vote occurred.*\n\n### Summary\nIn order to organize contributions more efficiently, this proposal introduces a project-based framework which allows groups and individuals to receive funding and proper remuneration for their work. The framework describes a unified structure for how projects should be presented, with the intent to scale VitaDAO's operations while preserving transparency and accountability.\n\n### Proposal Details\nAfter launch and with the increasing complexity of Working Groups - I’d like to propose a simple project application process for now. The aim is that all work done receives approval and individuals can get compensated properly for their contributions.\n\nProjects can apply with the following template:\n\n>Project Lead (Discord username)\n>\n>Who is leading this project? If approved, is that person willing to take on the Team role of lead for the project’s duration?\n>\n>Team (Discord usernames)\n>\n>Team - who will be involved in the project?\n>\n>Description: What is the project?\n>\n>Describe in a few short sentences what this project is about.\n>\n>Problem: What problem is this solving? Why?\n>\n>Briefly describe what problem this aims to solve. Why is this a problem worth solving? If this impacts the user, explain how it impacts them. If it helps, frame the problem as a pain point to the VitaDAO community. If applicable, please also mention the OKR this Project is contributing to.\n>\n>Success: How do we know if we’ve solved this problem?\n>\n>List out expected outcomes/goals for the community if you achieve the project goal. What does the project aim to accomplish?\n>\n>When: When does it ship, and what are the milestones?\n>\n>Define a timeline for how long you think this project will take. What are key milestones you will focus on?\n>\n>Budget\n>\n>What is the expected budget, and how will this budget be used and distributed among the team.\n\nThe finished proposal will then go to the Working Group Steward.\n\nWithin a certain threshold (I propose 2’500 USD), the two working group stewards (two) will approve the Project Proposal.\n\nProjects between 2’500 USD and 10’000 USD have to be approved by a majority vote of VitaCORE.\n\nProjects between 10’000 USD and 50’000 USD have to be approved by a majority vote on Discourse (Maybe Snapshot in the Future).\n\nProjects over 50’000 USD have to be approved by an On-Chain vote.\n\nLong-term this can be also use an online form to be more standardized and transparent.\n\nCredits to OlympusDAO for sharing this process.\n\n#### More information\nFor the full proposal with more details, see the discussion on [Discourse here](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-6-vitadao-working-group-projects-framework/267).",

Recently, in an unprecedented effort, a large-scale study employing advanced machine learning methods analyzed medical records from over 4 million individuals in the Danish Health System’s medical and prescription records. The study, consisting of over 1.4 billion prescriptions, found that a number of prescription drugs were highly associated with longer life- and health-span in long-live populations. Here, we present a unique investment opportunity. We seek to validate these observations through a series of carefully conducted wet lab experiments. If successful, this work could result in the repurposing of several FDA-approved therapeutics for the purpose of extending human lifespan, at a lower cost and over faster timelines than conceivably possible with de novo drug discovery. This unique investment opportunity allows savvy longevity investors the chance to own a share of the potential intellectual property generated from these studies, and in turn, a potential share in the future of life extension.\n\n### Proposal Details\n\n#### Justification\nThe global elderly population is projected to substantially increase throughout the 21st century. By the year 2100 a fifth of the total world population will be aged 65 or older posing a serious socioeconomic challenge to societies world-wide. Interventions that ensure healthy aging are therefore of critical importance.\n\n#### Next Steps\nThis program focuses on testing and developing three of these small molecules as possible interventions in aging. Specifically, we will test the drugs on human cell cultures and in fruit flies, before moving to mice in the future. Importantly, the current market for longevity stands at 200 billion USD, even without a single scientifically proven treatment. Our molecules targets this specific market with the aim of letting everyone live healthier, happier and longer lives.\n\n#### Research Background\nTo date, more than a hundred compounds have been shown to extend the lifespan of model organisms. In humans, no drug is currently recognized to extend lifespan. Given the large diversity of drugs able to extend the lifespan of model organisms it is likely that multiple drugs are able to extend the healthspan of humans. But how do we find these compounds?\n\nThe Scheibye-Knudsen lab has analyzed 1.5 billion prescriptions from 4.8 million individuals over 40 years in The Danish National Health Service Prescription Database and correlated this with the survival of individuals prescribed certain drugs. They received exclusive access to carry out this work. The Scheibye-Knudsen Lab has identified 10+ FDA approved medications that appear to have a strong effect on lifespan following analysis. This project will focus on optimising, repurposing, and re-formulating the 3 drugs with the strongest effect on human lifespan. Additionally, there is a database of compounds that could be pursued. The identities of the molecules are not disclosed in this presentation to protect the full viability of the intellectual property. They are referred to as X, Y, and Z.\n\n* **Phase I Duration: 12 months**\n* **Phase I Budget: $250,000**\n* **Phase II Duration: 12 months**\n* **Phase II Budget: $250,000 pending successful completion of Phase I and community vote.**\n\n#### Research Lead\nMorten Scheibye-Knudsen, Associate Professor\n\nMorten Scheibye-Knudsen is Associate Professor and group leader at the Center for Healthy Aging, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Besides his research activity, he has been committed to educational programs and his online companies Mitodb.com and Forsøgsperson.dk. The latter has grown to become the largest single provider of study participants in Denmark. Morten Scheibye-Knudsen also acts as an advisor or committee member for organisations such as the Longevity Vision Fund, the Lifeboat Foundation, the NNF Big Data in Biomedicine project and others. Morten Scheibye-Knudsen earned his MD in 2007 and his DMSc (PhD) in 2016 from the University of Copenhagen. After graduation, he worked as physician at Slagelse Hospital and at Nuuk Medical Clinic in Greenland. In 2008, he became a Postdoctoral Fellow at the National Institute on Aging at the NIH in Baltimore, Maryland. His work focused on the cross-talk between DNA repair and mitochondrial function in aging and has been honored by a number of competitive awards. In 2015 he was recruited to start his own research group at the University of Copenhagen, where his research group aims to understand the cellular and organismal consequences of DNA damage in the context of aging. He now runs one of the largest research programmes in Europe focusing on aging. His ultimate goal is to modulate and perhaps treat aging and age-related diseases, allowing everyone to live healthier and longer lives.\n\n#### Research Institution\nThe Center for Healthy Aging at the University of Copenhagen studies how more people can have a healthy life and healthy aging. Their approach to research is interdisciplinary and the center studies aging and aging processes from cell to society.\n\n#### IP\nAll intellectual property resulting from the project will be fully owned by VitaDAO.\n\n### Project Aims & Hypothesis\n\n#### Scientific Approach\nTo confirm findings from the database, it will be necessary to test how the compounds impact aging in controlled model organisms. We will apply a two-pronged approach by investigating the effect of the drugs on human cells in culture and the well-used aging model drosophila melanogaster. If these tests are positive we can proceed to test the compounds in mice and later transition to trials targeting aging in humans.\n\n#### Research Task\nTo confirm findings from the database, it will be necessary to test how the compounds impact aging in controlled model organisms. We will apply a two-pronged approach by investigating the effect of the drugs on human cells in culture and the well-used aging model drosophila melanogaster. If these tests are positive we can proceed to test the compounds in mice and later transition to trials targeting aging in humans.\n\nFor cells: we will use DNA damage induced senescent human cells as well as replicative senescent cells as models for aging. We will investigate the ability of the compounds to affect the senescence markers β-galactosidase staining, interleukin-6 secretion and lamin b1 levels. Another hallmark of aging and senescent cells is the accumulation of DNA damage foci, and we will investigate this by measuring the number of 53BP1 and gammaH2AX foci present in the cells by high content microscopy at the Biotech Research and Innovation Center.\n\nFor drosophila we will investigate how the drugs impact lifespan and motor function. Specifically, we will test log-scale concentration curves in a high-throughput lifespan machine that we have invented. We will further investigate how the compounds impact the motor function of flies.\n\n#### More information\nFor the full proposal with more details, see the discussion on [Discourse here](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-5-scheibye-knudsen-lab-funding-proposal/188).",

No snapshot vote occurred.*\n\n### Summary\nVitaDAO recommends the Fund (established in VDP-7, upon which this proposal depends) invest in Turn.bio or not, based on the on-chain vote for this proposal. You, the token holders, will decide.\n\nAfter multiple meetings and careful analysis with access to the Turn Bio Data room under NDA, the Longevity WG recommends an \"Agree\" vote.\n\n### Proposal Details\nTurn.Bio is developing therapeutics to correct aging-related conditions using mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based cellular reprogramming.\n\n* Scientific and market validation: Cellular reprogramming has emerged over the past half-decade as one of the most promising approaches for aging and aging-related disease. The most recent validation of this was a $270M investment to create Altos Labs funded by Yuri Milner, Jeff Bezos, amongst other high-profile investors.\n* Out in front in both core technologies: reprogramming and mRNA-lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based gene therapy. The reprogramming approach the field has gravitated towards is conceptually based on the 2012 Nobel Prize work of Shinya Yamanaka. The LNP approach has similarities to that used in the COVID-19 vaccines as well as gene therapy applications already tested in humans, e.g., by Alnylam - a MIT-founded $20B+ market cap biotech.\n* Strategic lead indications: skin and eye indications have strong market demand. Additionally, Turn.Bio has novel payload delivery approaches for both.\n* Elite management (CEO, Anja Krammer, has IPO’d biotech companies before) and scientific team (Stanford Univ. IP, peer-reviewed science in leading outlets, such as Nature journals).\n* Already supported by top tech and longevity investors such as Khosla Ventures and Methuselah Fund.\n* Fits the fund’s thesis of relatively lesser-risk, already patented technology (vs. VitaDAO, which funds relatively higher-risk, pre-startup technology, e.g., VDP-5).\n* Turn Bio provides a potential buyer of reprogramming, mRNA, and LNP technology being developed by others that VitaDAO is considering.\n\n#### More information\nFor the full proposal with more details, see the discussion on [Discourse here](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-8-turn-biotechnologies-turn-bio-investment-analysis-and-recommendation/345).",

      "title": "VDP-14 Move Tier 3 Governance to Snapshot",
      "content": "***NOTE:** This is a duplicate of an [on chain proposal](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9aBF28aB6f80c1EF666f983935437E717Aafff7a#readContract) from prior to VitaDAO's using snapshot, and is present here for completeness on snapshot. No snapshot vote occurred.*\n\n### Summary\nIn order to encourage more governance participation, and reduce governance friction, I propose we move our Tier 3 governance into Snapshot. This would not replace our current Tier 1 (Discord) and Tier 2 (Discourse) governance, and discussions at those levels would still need to happen prior to a Tier 3 vote, but the Tier 3 (previously on-chain) vote would happen on Snapshot.\n\n### Proposal Details\n\n[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) governance requires no Ethereum gas to vote, and would serve the VitaDAO community far more effectively than Ethereum Layer 1 governance. We want to encourage participation in all governance levels by making the price of participation only the cost of the VITA a voter holds. This would mean people who earn VITA incentives through participation and who have no other crypto holdings (perhaps a researcher) could weigh in on significant proposals. For our mission and our DAO, the quality of our governance can only improve the more inclusive it is of the many people we incentivize with VITA.\n\nVitaDAO's Tier 1 and Tier 2 governance are set such that at those levels one person equals one vote. When we move to Tier 3, the voting becomes one VITA token one vote. Moving to snapshot for Tier 3 will retain this mechanic, and will not require staking VITA to vote. It will simply require having VITA in the wallet with which you vote. The name of the tool, 'Snapshot,' describes how the vote works. At a certain block on Ethereum Mainnet, the service takes snapshot of VITA holders and amounts. The voting power for a wallet is the amount of VITA the wallet has at the time of that snapshot. For this reason, I suggest we announce proposals as early as possible and that those announcements include the intended snapshot block number as well as the time the voting starts and ends.\n\n#### Proposal Creation\nCurrently, proposal creation is done by the DAO exclusively, and only after discussion on Discord and Discourse. I propose we retain this workflow when we move to snapshot. In Snapshot, all stewards will have the Author role, and proposal creation will be permissible only for authors. This will prevent spam proposals from distracting the DAO, and will encourage the meaningful use of the other tiers of governance. The timeline for voting will still be the 7 days, with the voting delay being 12 hours. Snapshot allows more flexibility on timelines than the Raphael contract did, but for now we'll keep it the same and add more proposals to make use of that flexibility as VitaDAO sees fit.\n\n#### Migrating Proposals from Currently Smart Contract\nThe current smart contract contains the voting information and a link to the proposal content on IPFS. In order for there to be a continuous governance record, I propose we take the current proposals and migrate them to Snapshot so people can obtain all governance records from one place. We will do this by copying each proposal over to snapshot and fixing the vote result to match the result from the on-chain vote (we will not try to match the amount of votes). To guarantee provenance of the copy, each of the initial snapshot proposals will contain a reference to the original smart contract proposal data and the link to the original IPFS document.\n\n#### Effects on Smart Contracts\nI propose the [Raphael smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9aBF28aB6f80c1EF666f983935437E717Aafff7a) and the [Staking contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x711F2ac9E39615e07B4fe4548154D698B517a66D) be shutdown using the mechanism built into the contracts to do so. This will stop additional proposal creation on chain, and will immediately allow all VITA holders to unstake their VITA. We will do this during a time of no active proposals, and allow at least 3 days for everyone to reclaim their staked VITA before creating a new proposal that takes a snapshot of VITA balances.\n\nWhile we can shutdown the smart contract, Ethereum doesn't have the concept of deletion. All of the Raphael contract activities, events, and records are forever on chain, and forever queryable. In this way, our existing governance will still carry the same weight and effect as it does now, and we will reference that in the on-chain proposals we copy over into snapshot.\n\n#### IPNFT Holder Change\nOne side effect the shutdown has is that the contract can no longer hold the IPNFTs. I propose we move the IPNFT(s) to the current VitaDAO Gnosis multi-signature wallet. This will allow for lower cost operations on the IPNFT(s), have the same security as current treasury management (5 of 8 signers needed), and allow the option of moving towards more decentralized ownership in the future if we choose to use [Zodiac](https://gnosis.github.io/zodiac/).\n\n#### Snapshot Settings\nSnapshot requires many settings, and most of them are self explanatory - [you can find the docs here](https://docs.snapshot.org/spaces/create). The ones of note, how I propose we set them, and why are below:\n\n* Network\n  * Ethereum Mainnet, because that's where all the VITA live.\n* Skin\n  * Aligned with current and future DAO web page design\n* Domain Name\n  * `vote.vitadao.com` - and we will continue to support voting on dao.vitadao.com with implementation to support snapshot\n* Strategies\n  * `erc20-balance-of VITA` - we will begin here, and add strategies to ensure we can vote with any staked VITA or tokens locked for other reasons VitaDAO governance decides upon in the future.\n* Admins\n  * A small list of three stewards, to include @audieleon and @vincentweisser as technical working group leadership and @theobtl as the governance working group lead. This is a small, high trust group because admins and controllers have deletion rights on proposals. The group needs to be big enough to allow continuance of control if someone leaves the DAO, and small enough that misbehavior is easily auditable.\n* Authors (currently \"Members\" in the docs)\n  * As described above, all stewards and only stewards will be authors of proposals. This allows Tier 1 and Tier 2 governance to continue to have its important place, and keeps the list of proposals on snapshot high quality.\n* Allow Only Authors to Submit Proposals\n  * This will be true, to ensure only authors can submit proposals.\n\n#### Final Note\nThe VITA token contract will remain unchanged by this proposal, and all of your VITA will remain yours. If this vote passes, we will announce the dates of the changes above. We will also provide explainers on how to reclaim your VITA from the staking contract and how to vote using snapshot. All your previous votes are still in effect and will remain so. This proposal simply makes governance easier, free, and more effective by including more voters.\n\n#### More information\nFor the full proposal with more details, see the discussion on [Discourse here](https://gov.vitadao.com/t/vdp-14-move-tier-3-governance-to-snapshot/442).\n\nAuthor: Audie Sheridan (@audieleon, @audieleon##9746 on discord, and audie.eth)",

No snapshot vote occurred.*\n\n### Summary\nThe VitaDAO Longevity Working Group has been evaluating the Rubedo Life Science Inc company under NDA after multiple discussions over 3 months.\n\nScientific reviews digest: The review team included 5 PhDs (3 of which are professor / PI level) and 2 PhD-candidates. All have expressed a vote in agreement. To quantify the level of conviction, some have provided a score on a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being the most excited), the average score was 3.8.\n\nHere we are presenting an overview of the science and business in front of the VITA community. You, the token holders, decide the ultimate VitaDAO assessment outcome via a Yes / No vote to signal agreement or disagreement with the Longevity WG assessment.\n\n### Proposal Details\n\nTeam formed by an exceptional mix of veteran drug hunters from Pharma and Biotech, Silicon Valley tech leaders, and world-class longevity scientists (from Stanford, etc). The unique discovery platform Alembic combines unparalleled computational biology and proprietary chemistry technologies. Raised $12M Seed round led by Khosla Ventures. All Intellectual Property (IP) is fully owned by Rubedo. Multiple patents filed. First patent has been issued and granted this year. Rubedo developed a portfolio of lead compounds for a pipeline of multiple indications of age-related diseases. Partnership with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center has been established to advance the first program on lung fibrosis and interstitial lung diseases.
