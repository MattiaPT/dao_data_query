      "title": "[AIP 113] Initial Funding of the Alchemix Association",
      "content": "# Motivation\nAlchemix operates primarily via a DAO Multisig of founders, contributors, and community members that acts as the primary DAO mechanism. The goal of Alchemix is to turn over power to on-chain governance. While Alchemix v3 is being built with the specific objective of incorporating on-chain governance, the Alchemix DAO needs a key partner to provide services aligning with the Alchemix DAO's interests – such as managing treasury farming and payroll operations, signing agreements, marketing… etc.\n\nIn an ideal world, users will always trust some combination of immutability, on-chain governance, and legal entities. Where DAO Multisig powers and other responsibilities do not have a clear path to on-chain governance, they can instead be left to a legal entity. For the reasons set out below, the Swiss association has proved to be the best of the various options we have analyzed \n\n# Swiss Association Benefits\n\nSwitzerland was chosen for its crypto-friendly environment, clear regulatory framework, favorable tax regime, and supportive banking sector. The Swiss association (among all available entity types) was preferred for the following reasons:\n\n- The Swiss association has rights of personhood and can therefore hold assets, funds, enter into contracts (for example Gauntlet Aera per AIP 111); \n- The Swiss association provides liability protection to the association members and board members, as only the association’s assets are used to meet liabilities.\n- The Swiss association is a flexible vehicle. The organization as well as the purpose of the Swiss association can evolve and be adapted to the needs of a project.\n- The Swiss association is not allowed to provide any financial benefits to its members, which means that the Swiss association cannot distribute any funds to its members in the form of dividends or other benefits.\n\n# Alchemix Association\n\nThe Alchemix Association is a Swiss entity and has its registered office in Zug, Switzerland.\n\nThe bodies of the Alchemix Association are:\n- The general assembly of members; and\n- The board\n\nThe Alchemix Association will be composed of contributors/founders/community members. \n\n# Association Purpose/Mission\nThe purpose of the Association is to foster the growth of the Alchemix ecosystem; to enable technical and operational development by hiring and managing contractors, to drive strategy, partnerships, and governance, and to help evolve legal, security, and overall best practices in supporting the Decentralized Autonomous Organization of Alchemix DAO. \n\n# Alchemix Association / DAO Relationship\nThe objective has always been to ensure that ownership and control of the DAO remain with the token holders. The structuring of the Alchemix Association upholds such objective. In line with its statutory purpose, the Alchemix Association shall assist the Alchemix DAO in its continued growth and in achieving its goals under the principal – agent relationship.\n\n    \n![image](ipfs://bafkreig63hwxmewe3aorshhzetdxecupj7qsbtrhbbukttrlmg5du7jirq)\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidnx55n2k2u3wwwauuawcwqpvmpspnnxndsusm2djbu32xu6g3srm)\n    \n\nIn this model, the legal entity is an independent service provider that is engaged by the DAO to act on its behalf and promote the growth of the ecosystem. The legal entity co-exists with the DAO and does not act as a “legal wrapper”. This means that the legal entity does not protect the DAO and its members from potential liability. On the other hand, this model ensures that the control over Alchemix effectively remains with the DAO.\n\nThe establishment and funding of the Association aligns with the principal-agent model, as the Alchemix DAO decides:\n\n- **What powers the Alchemix Association shall have (see the requests  below)**. It means that the responsibilities of the Alchemix Association will not overlap with the DAO Multisig and will, therefore, be truly separate. The intent is to pass as many responsibilities as possible from the existing DAO MultiSig to the Alchemix Association.\n- **Whether the Alchemix Association remains a trusted partner:** The DAO may, at any time, choose to contract with fund another legal entity instead of, or in addition to, the Alchemix Association. In the event of the dissolution of the Alchemix Association, any assets remaining after the payment of all debts/liabilities will be distributed in accordance with the purpose of the Alchemix Association after a vote of its members, which permits the assets to be sent back to the DAO. In this perspective, the Alchemix Association intents to request quarterly renewal of its agreement with the DAO\n\n# Distribution of Roles and Responsibilities\n\nBased on this governance proposal, responsibilities within the Alchemix ecosystem will be divided between the DAO and the Association as follows:\n\n- **Alchemix DAO Responsibilities:** The DAO will remain in operation as a DAO Multisig with snapshot vote signaling from ALCX holders, eventually moving to on-chain governance. The DAO will retain control of Alchemist, Transmuter, AMO, and bridging contracts as well as continue to receive all protocol income. All of these responsibilities are intended to be handed over to on-chain governance pending development and launch of Alchemix v3.\n- **Alchemix Association Responsibilities:** The Alchemix Association will assume the following responsibilities): \n\n1. Managing the existing treasury funds consisting of the liquid and illiquid assets described below.\n2. Managing and fulfilling admin roles for the Alchemix smart contracts, excluding Alchemists, Transmuters, xalAssets (xERC20-enabled Layer 2 alAssets) and AMOs. \n3. Holding, licensing, and enforcing the intellectual property rights related to the Alchemix brand.\n4. Maintaining the public GitHub repository of Alchemix\n5. Managing the social media accounts of Alchemix\n6. Entering into agreement with selected external service providers and paying corresponding service fees \n7. Engaging in any commercial and non-commercial agreements that support the purpose of the Alchemix Association\n\nTo empower the Alchemix Association to fulfill the above responsibilities, the DAO shall transfer the following assets to the Alchemix Association:\n- All assets listed under https://alchemix-stats.com/ excluding 50,000 ALCX tokens\n\nAfter the transfer is complete, all future transfers of assets from the DAO to the  Association will require the DAO to pass a governance proposal. \n\nBy accepting this governance proposal, the Alchemix Association irrevocably waives its right to claim any intellectual property rights relating to the Alchemix brand and authorizes the Alchemix Association to reach out to DAO individuals and enter into the necessary agreements to secure the rights required to fulfill the listed responsibilities.\n\n# Requests\n\nAt this time, the newly established Alchemix Association is requesting Approve the transfer of the responsibilities and assets listed above\n\n# Voting\nFor/Against/Abstain the above request..",

      "title": "[AIP 111] Alchemix Sustainability Framework",
      "content": "# Proposal\n\nThis proposal seeks to define a framework for Alchemix to ensure:\nThe treasury is adequately funded each quarter\nEffective ALCX emissions are in line with expected ALCX emissions (ie, limit additional ALCX spent by the treasury)\nDefine priorities for excess revenue from the AMOs and the treasury, after above needs are met. \nAllow for yield farming of the treasury at the discretion of the multisig, including utilizing Gauntlet’s Aera product.\n\nThis proposal also details how the framework will be executed. \n\n# Context \n\nAlchemix currently earns revenue primarily from three sources: The Elixir AMOs, the 10% fee on all yield, and treasury yield-farming positions. The earnings of the Elixir AMO, and some treasury positions, are created by voting with treasury positions (such as sdCRV) and ALCX emissions used as vote incentives. Much of the value of the spent ALCX is recouped through CRV, CVX, FXS, and other emissions. However, the net result is that the amount of ALCX in the treasury is depleting over time, with about a 1.5-year runway. \n\nAdditionally, the treasury currently operates on a budget of 450k per quarter as defined in (AIP-450)[https://snapshot.org/#/alchemixstakers.eth/proposal/0x946608f1c5b3046fb412cdbb3e3a298a500a30db98694274e30ae559438c9272]. The baseline projected budget is much lower, at ~300k/quarter, with the 450k budget typically only being met when audits and audit expenses are necessary. \n\nLastly, Alchemix intends to pay veALCX lockers for locking ALCX/ETH balancer liquidity, which will require a portion of revenue. Given the recent delay of veALCX, this mechanism will be addressed in a future proposal.\n\n# Framework for Revenue\n\nThe following framework applies to weekly AMO revenue:\nIf treasury stablecoins + ETH alone are < $2m, fund treasury with up to $35k in stables. Note this target excludes protocol owned alAsset liquidity. \nBuyback all ALCX from the treasury that are used for vote incentives, minus 2200 ALCX of weekly emissions\nExcess revenue will be used to buy into protocoled-owned alAsset liquidity, which will be built up and eventually be distributed as veALCX revenue.\n\nThe following framework applies to weekly treasury revenue (using yield from treasury assets):\nIf treasury stablecoins < $2m AND #1 above was not completed, fund treasury with up to $35k in stables (including amount from #1 above)\nRemaining farmed assets shall be used to accumulate liquidity-driving assets, stablecoins, and ETH, at the discretion of the multisig. (focus on stablecoins/eth when big audits or other expenses are coming up, focus on liquidity driving assets otherwise)\nAssets held in the treasury may be deposited in DeFi strategies to earn yield at the discretion of the mulsitig, including Gauntlet’s Aera product. \n\n\n\nIn all scenarios where claiming revenue instead of locking would require a significant penalty or forgo significant rewards, the multisig may opt to relock instead of following these procedures. An example of such revenue is OP rewards from locking into veVELO.\n\n## Gauntlet Aera\nThe multisig will be running two trial vaults with Gauntlet’s Aera product, which automatically manages funds in a non-custodial manner. This management includes automatically shifting eth/stables to the highest-yielding whitelisted strategies, leveraging stETH in AAVE for additional yield, and balancing yield into ETH accumulation. Aera is a means by which custody of the treasury could potentially be handed over to on-chain governance while still allowing for active management. It also allows for higher yield without requiring the multisig to frequently rebalance manually, which will ultimately extend Alchemix’s runway. More information is available in this proposal from Aera. \n\n# Framework for ALCX used for external Vote Incentives\n\nALCX vote incentive quantities will be modified each epoch through the following workflow.\n\nIf alAsset is at a price where there is demand for self-repaying loans (defined by growth in loans over last month OR alAsset price above 0.99) AND the AMO earned more in revenue than the value of ALCX used to incentivize votes in the prior epoch, and there are no further significant ecosystem changes ->  vote incentives will remain as is or can increase up to 10%. \nIf the alAsset is at a price where there is no demand for self-repaying loans,  the AMO earned more in revenue than the value of ALCX used to incentivize votes in the prior epoch -> Vote incentives will remain as is or increase up to 10%, and the AMO will do a single-sided withdrawal. \nIf the alAsset is at a price where there is demand for self-repaying loans, AND the AMO did not earn more in revenue than the value of ALCX used to incentivize votes in the prior epoch -> Vote incentives shall be decreased by at least 5%. \nIf the alAsset is at a price where there is no demand for self-repaying loans, AND the AMO did not earn more in revenue than the value of ALCX used to incentivize votes in the prior epoch -> Vote incentives shall be decreased by at least 5%, and the AMO will do a single-sided withdrawal. \n\nThe following restrictions apply:\nThe AMO shall never withdraw if it owns less than 50% of the liquidity pool. \nTo limit the negative effects of miscalculations, the absolute maximum ALCX that can be used from the treasury for all liquidity in all pools on all chains for one week of vote incentives is 10,000 ALCX.\n\n# Implementation\nIn the short term, this framework will begin to be manually implemented. First and foremost, ALCX buybacks will begin based on AMO revenue. It is expected that given the operational intensity of the framework, operations are batched such that actions are carried out at least every month, based on the month's results as a whole. \n\nNote that constantly changing prices and vote incentive values in the market will mean this framework will be somewhat subjective based on how values are calculated. That is OK - the intent is for this to be a rough framework to ensure Alchemix is sustainable in terms of ALCX in the treasury and tier-1 asset treasury runway. \n\nVarious tools will be developed to assist in the implementation of this framework. Firstly, an external team has already made significant progress on a dashboard used to harvest AMOs into assets as specified by this framework. Secondly, a future dashboard will be built to assist the multisig in the determination of ALCX vote incentives each epoch.\n\n# Voting\nFor, Against, or Abstain the above framework",

      "title": "[AIP-110] Donate to Roman Storm & Alexey Pertsev's legal defense fund",
      "content": "## Context\n\nAlexey Pertsev and Roman Storm, two developers who contributed to Tornado Cash, were arrested in different jurisdictions following OFAC's sanctions in 2022. Their 2024 trials are setting important precedents for developers, privacy protocols, and the crypto industry more broadly. Alexey’s first trial took place on March 26 of this year (with verdict and further potential legal action scheduled for mid-May), and Roman’s trial is scheduled for late September.\n\nThe government’s attempt to criminalize Roman and Alexey for a third party’s misuse of open-source software is unjust and unlawful. But while legal advocates are spending enormous effort and money (see here: https://www.theblock.co/post/286828/three-crypto-advocacy-groups-file-amicus-briefs-in-tornado-cash-developer-roman-storms-case) to defend Storm and Pertsev, the developers are faced with two governments using all of their resources to prosecute them and treat them like terrorists.\n\nRoman and Alexey need your help to build a strong legal defense not just for their sake, but for crypto users and developers worldwide. Justice DAO is advocating on their behalf and helping to raise funds for their legal defense. However, time and money are running out and we need support from influential protocols and organizations within the Ethereum ecosystem. This donation will not only help to fund ongoing legal defense work but also send a message of solidarity to Roman and Alexey while they fight against government overreach and abuse of power.\n\nView Roman Storm's statement here:\nhttps://x.com/rstormsf/status/1749490246000238942\n\nAlexey and Roman’s legal defense fund on Juicebox:\nhttps://juicebox.money/@free-pertsev-and-storm\n\nComplete breakdown of associated funding and costs:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P69NhyLshI6kwfo7KqaA_rNUV5vpRw9JTJOfFAsdqAk/edit?usp=sharing\n\n## Addressing Legal Concerns and Reasons to Donate\n\n### A. Hundreds of donors have already stepped up to defend open-source code\n\n1. Since 2022, over 800 donations totaling ~750 ETH have been received. Some of the most reputable figures & organizations in crypto have supported and/or donated, including:\n* Edward Snowden\n* Vitalik Buterin\n* Gnosis\n* Moloch DAO\n* Matter Labs\n* Bankless\n* BGD Labs\n* Nouns DAO\n* MetaCartel DAO\n\n2. Donations are managed by Justice DAO, a US-based decentralized autonomous organization registered in the state of Wyoming. Justice DAO is operated for charitable purposes by sympathizers of Roman Storm and Alexey Pertsev.\n\n3. Donations are processed in compliance with US laws. Donated funds are paid to the outside counsel representing Storm and Pertsev and are applied to outstanding invoices for legal fees and costs.\n\n### B. Donations are legitimate, legal, and ethical\n\n1. This campaign will make history and donors should decide which side they want to be on.\n* A number of well-known industry participants have already decided to stand with Roman & Alexey and against government overreach.\n* This is not just about defending developers – although that is important – it is also about demonstrating that the crypto community is full of good people who comply with the law. It is about defeating the government’s narrative that crypto is only used by criminals and others who have wrongful motives.\n\n2. Donating to a defense fund is legal in the United States. So is discussing and supporting donation efforts publicly on platforms (as in the case with Snapshot and Tally, for example).\n* There is no legal or ethical prohibition against defense funds. And in the US, donors arguably have First Amendment rights to contribute to causes like this one, free from government interference or retaliation.\n* Both Alexey Pertsev and Roman Storm are represented by reputable counsel based in the Netherlands and the state of California, respectively. There is an obvious, legitimate need for defense funding because they are in the middle of defending themselves against two different governments that have vast resources to use against them.\n* Several advocacy groups including [Coin Center](https://x.com/valkenburgh/status/1776327351657181293), [Blockchain Association](https://x.com/BlockchainAssn/status/1776345227717951600), and [DeFi Education Fund](https://x.com/amandatums/status/1776293907929714757), have already recognized the need here and have filed public amicus briefs in support of the defense efforts. Confidentiality issues limit how much can be said between now and then, but there is substantial and increasing community support for Mr. Storm and Mr. Pertsev, including organizations that are willing to make public statements in court in support of this cause.\n\n3. The fundraising campaign is compliant with the law.\n* Donors have the option of contributing to the cause directly through JusticeDAO’s website [wewantjusticedao.org](https://wewantjusticedao.org/) or by contributing ETH via [juicebox.money](https://discord.com/channels/738480789464940634/1229856088891981834/1229857159383224410).\n* All incoming donations are screened for risk indicators, including money laundering and sanctions risk. Details about the process are not publicized in order to maintain the integrity of the process, but anyone who has questions can reach out directly via Twitter/X @FreeAlexeyRoman.\n* Once donated, funds are used to pay for legal fees and costs (e.g., expert witnesses and consultants) actually incurred. The lawyers for Mr. Storm and Mr. Pertsev have to submit their invoices for review and approval, and any extra funds are held in a trust account to be applied for payment of future legal fees and costs.\n* Donations will NOT be used to cover legal or any other costs of Mr. Roman Semenov, who currently holds the status of a Specially Designated National (SDN) according to the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\n \n\n### Voting Options\n\n* Yes, fund with 15 ETH\n* Yes, fund with 10 ETH\n* Yes, fund with 5 ETH\n* No, do not fund\n* Abstain\n\nVOTING IS RANKED CHOICE",

      "title": "[AIP-109] Alchemix Market Making Agreement",
      "content": "# Proposal\n\nThis proposal seeks to enter a market-making agreement for ALCX. The primary focus will be Binance and Coinbase, with small quotes supporting tight spreads on OKX, Kraken, and Crypto.com. The terms are as follows:\n\n1. Alchemix will loan 30k ALCX to the market maker, who will use the funds to make ALCX markets \n    a. Note: the market maker has asked that Alchemix not share the name of the firm. It is a reputable firm with experience and name recognition.\n2. The initial term will be 3 months, with a fixed strike price in USDC at some % higher than the price of ALCX at the start of the term.\n    a. Note: the market maker has asked that Alchemix not share the agreed-upon strike price.\n    b. Note: the strike price is based on the 5-day average price of ALCX at the time of renewal.\n3. If the strike price is not hit, Alchemix will seek another 3-month term, with a new fixed strike price based on the price of ALCX at the start of the new term.\n4. If the strike price is hit, Alchemix will intend to seek another 3-month term. USDC obtained from the strike will be used to buy back ALCX to the treasury, and the treasury will renew the loan with 30k ALCX. \n5. At the end of any term, should the net result be that Alchemix has sold more than 30k ALCX to the market maker (ie, total ALCX sent over **all** terms minus total ALCX or ALCX value of USDC received at end of term < 30k), Alchemix will re-evaluate the agreement and put forth a DAO proposal to either continue with the agreement, propose a new market maker and/or terms, or terminate market-making loans altogether. \n\n# Context \n\nAlchemix enlisted a market maker at launch and did not renew the agreement when it expired in late 2022. Alchemix has been fortunate to be listed on major exchanges without needing to pay for listings or broker any form of deal. However, lower volumes during the bear market without an active market maker mean there is a risk of ALCX pairs being delisted. Being relisted without paying fees is difficult after a delisting. \n\nMarket makers are desirable as they create deeper liquidity on exchanges, which can allow larger swaps and bring more attention to the token. Neither of these is intrinsically necessary for the success of the protocol, but they do attract more people to learn about Alchemix. Additionally, being delisted from a centralized exchange significantly reduces the potential reach of the protocol. Given the current potentially early/mid-stage bull market, this could be a sizable amount of missed opportunity for attention. \n\nThe downside of market makers is that incentives can diverge from the best interest of the community and project. To counteract this risk, market makers align their incentive by asking for no other financial incentive other than a right to buy the token at a higher price at a specific future date, where they can repay the loan in ALCX or USDC. One issue with some crypto market makers (generalized, across all of DeFi) is that makers often sell a majority of the token for USDC on the first major price pump and then make with those funds as the token bleeds out during the rest of the term. In that situation, the maker makes a significant profit and the DAO ends up selling ALCX at a low price relative to what it reached. To counter this risk, Alchemix sought to adjust the model (as described below) and we decided to work with a reputable market maker (as recommended by partners) that is working with local regulators (relative to the jurisdiction of the makers’ company) to validate its practices.\n\nThe BizDev SubDAO discussed market-making models with multiple market makers and other experienced teams in DeFi. Ultimately, it was determined the best way to improve the model was to break the deal down into shorter, 3-month terms. This has a few key benefits:\n1. The expected price change of ALCX is more limited, which caps the amount of ALCX that could be effectively sold at a discount in a period. \n2. Strike prices are adjusted each term based on current market conditions\n3. There are more points at which the DAO can evaluate and monitor the spending of ALCX.\n4. The market maker is still able to hedge their risk through strike prices.\n5. The market maker has an incentive to minimize the number of tokens sold and create a more positive outcome for the DAO as there are more frequent renewal periods.\n\n\n# Voting\nFor, Against, or Abstain the above framework",

In that situation, the maker makes a significant profit and the DAO ends up selling ALCX at a low price relative to what it reached. To counter this risk, Alchemix sought to adjust the model (as described below) and we decided to work with a reputable market maker (as recommended by partners) that is working with local regulators (relative to the jurisdiction of the makers’ company) to validate its practices.\n\nThe BizDev SubDAO discussed market-making models with multiple market makers and other experienced teams in DeFi. Ultimately, it was determined the best way to improve the model was to break the deal down into shorter, 3-month terms. This has a few key benefits:\n1. The expected price change of ALCX is more limited, which caps the amount of ALCX that could be effectively sold at a discount in a period. \n2. Strike prices are adjusted each term based on current market conditions\n3. There are more points at which the DAO can evaluate and monitor the spending of ALCX.\n4. The market maker is still able to hedge their risk through strike prices.\n5. The market maker has an incentive to minimize the number of tokens sold and create a more positive outcome for the DAO as there are more frequent renewal periods.\n\n\n# Voting\nFor, Against, or Abstain the above framework",

      "title": "[AIP-107] Invest in Blueberry",
      "content": "### Proposal\n\nInvest $25-50k in the Blueberry ecosystem.\n### Context\nEarly last year [AIP-78](https://snapshot.org/#/alchemixstakers.eth/proposal/0xd841e976667c4e2c25e7b4a6b797b65760ec45bc003a6007220e5a2cd2b7a006) approved the deployment of $500k worth of treasury ALCX into Blueberry protocol upon launch.\nAfter multiple rounds of audits and the launch of an additional protocol in the meantime called Bloom/StakeUp, Blueberry is launching this week.\n\nIn short [Blueberry](https://www.blueberry.garden) is a lending-borrowing platform where users deposit collateral and then are able to borrow funds worth more than their deposit. The reason the platform can allow this, is that the users do not actually receive the borrowed funds, but are able to select a strategy where those funds will be deployed. This way, Blueberry is always in possession of both the collateral and the borrowed funds of the user, and is able to liquidate if the price of the assets changes unfavorably. However, the protocol remains non-custodial and decentralized, enabling high spot leverage without the common concern of counterparty risk (though it does of course introduce smart contract risk). \nFor a more detailed description of what Blueberry does and how it operates, please read [AIP-78](https://snapshot.org/#/alchemixstakers.eth/proposal/0xd841e976667c4e2c25e7b4a6b797b65760ec45bc003a6007220e5a2cd2b7a006).\n\nBlueberry will enable multiple pools of Alchemix to be used by borrowers, providing additional utility for our alAsset and ALCX LPs.\nThe success of Blueberry is thus beneficial to Alchemix.\n\nThe other protocol that has been launched is called Bloom/StakeUp and it is a protocol bringing US treasury yields on-chain by allowing anyone to lend to market makers without KYC, while the loans are over-collateralized onchain by US treasuries. Their v1, Bloom, is already live and accessible at https://www.bloom.garden/. The v2, StakeUp, will launch in the coming weeks, providing a more composable stable asset (Bloom issues an additional volatile token with each loan tranche, while StakeUp provides a stablecoin that auto-rolls and pays the same yield from Bloom). StakeUp’s volatile token SUP also receives revenue from performance fees.\n\nThe focus for Alchemix remains to be the main Blueberry lending-borrowing protocol, but there might be possible integrations for the Bloom product as well in the future.\n\nWe have the option to take part in their investment round that is just about to close.\nThe investment round is at Fully Diluted Valuations of:\n\n- $20M (BLB - Blueberry)\n- $15M (SUP - StakeUp)\n\nIn reality both valuations are counted double, as in this investment round the invested amount will entitle Alchemix to a stake in both protocols worth the investment amount.\nSo a $50k invested would buy a 0.33% stake in Bloom/StakeUp worth $50k and a 0.25% stake in Blueberry worth $50k.\n\nThe allocations would each vest with the same vesting terms: 1 year cliff + 12 month linear vest thereafter. However, once the Blueberry ve system launches, vesting stakes can also vote, effectively mirroring the behaviour of ve locked tokens.\n\nThree different options are presented, to invest $50k, $25k or not to invest. The treasury is healthy enough that neither option would cause a strain on our runway.\n### Voting\nVoting is single-choice for simplicity, however if the votes are split between the maximum and zero investment options, the middle option will be executed ($25k).\n\n- Yes, invest $50k in Blueberry\n- Yes, invest $25k in Blueberry\n- No, do not invest in Blueberry\n- Abstain",

More specific information can be found in their medium articles at https://medium.com/@blueprintfi\nThey have attended one of the Alchemix firesides and introduced the protocol to our community.\n\nThe team behind Blueprint is the same as Retro on Polygon PoS and the soon-to-be launching Zero on Polygon zkEVM. Retro has been very successful, growing to be the 5th largest DEX on Polygon PoS in terms of volume according to DefiLlama, while only launching 6 months ago.\n\nThe initial ve(3,3) codebase for Retro was that of Thena’s (most of which is a variation of the original Solidly code), both of which have now been around for an extended period of time.\nBlueprint and Zero contain the addition of the automated ve(3,3) mechanics and will use the same codebase.\nAlso, the underlying pools are Uniswap v3 forks and the Solidly stable and correlated pools, all of which are considered to be amongst the most battle tested codebases out there.\n\nThe valuation for the seed investment would be the same as their presale valuation as shown here: https://www.blueprint.fi/presale\nAlchemix would immediately receive a vote-locked position and would be able to start using it upon the launch of the DEX.\n\nAs one of the more unique DEXes launching on Ethereum mainnet lately and run by a well-known team, this proposal calls for an initial $50k investment in Blueprint to acquire voting power for alAsset pools.\n### Voting\nVoting is single-choice.\n\n- A yes vote approves the investment of $50k in Blueprint\n- A no vote signals that no funds should be invested in Blueprint\n- Abstain",

      "content": "### Summary\n\n[AIP-74-A](https://snapshot.org/#/alchemixstakers.eth/proposal/0x5cd88ef66adc6fbd32674696cb5d63b55b80cd3430ae5155eca0af7568e04922) decided how the OP grant that Alchemix received would be used for boosting the Alchemix vaults on the Optimism network. Some time has passed since then, and circumstances have evolved. Therefore, a different allocation of the OP grant is being proposed for the boost.\n\n### Details\n\nThe start of the OP boost program was delayed, as the core team had been waiting for Yearn to activate their own OP boost on the Optimism network. Then, the Multichain situation introduced further delays which was then followed by the Curve hack. There have been two important ecosystem changes that prompted this proposal:\n\nDuring the last 6 to 12 months, it has been evidenced that the Alchemix ETH vaults are more desirable than the stablecoin vaults. This suggests that we should be allocating more of our resources to support this use-case for now.\n\nBecause of how Yearn has allocated their OP boosts, their yvWETH vault, inclusive of the OP boost, currently has a higher yield than the native ETH staking yield. This means that when large amounts of funds start moving into this vault as a result of our own OP boosts, it will compress the APR of the yvWETH vault, pushing it to be below that of stETH. At that point, it makes more sense to allocate the additional boost to stETH itself.\n\nFor the above reasons, it is proposed that we do not allocate any of the boost to the yvDai vault, allocate less to the yvWETH vault and use the remainder for our stETH vault, resulting in allocations of 33% yvUSDC, 33% yvWETH and 33% stETH.\nThe total OP to be spent for this purpose, as per the grant, is 125k OP tokens, to be distributed over the course of 6 months.\n\n### Voting\n\nVoting is single-choice.\n\n- A vote of Approval will set the new OP vault boost allocation to 33% yvUSDC, 33% yvWETH and 33% stETH.\n- A vote of Disapproval will have the OP grant be distributed as per the initial vote, which was 25% yvUSDC, 25% yvDai and 50% yvWETH.\n- Abstain",

      "content": "### Proposal\n\nDeposit 1.5k ALCX tokens from the treasury to Fyde protocol.\n\n### Context\n\nFyde is a DeFi protocol designed to upgrade and simplify the crypto treasury and asset management process for DeFi users, enabling long-term and sustainable growth (from their docs). Their app is accessible at https://app.fyde.fi/ and their docs at https://fyde.gitbook.io/ \nThe Fyde team has done a presentation during the Alchemix fireside on the 8th of December.\n\nEssentially, Fyde maintains a basket of bluechip DeFi assets with pre-defined weights. ALCX is part of this basket. Anyone can deposit any of the basket assets and they receive a share of the basket, in the form of the $TRSY token.\nFyde also makes it possible for protocols to retain their voting rights of a token that they deposited, if they choose to do so.\n\nThe fact that ALCX is part of this basket means that ALCX can be deposited into this pool up to the maximum acceptable share in the basket (5-10% of the total pool), without any price impact to the token.\n\nFyde is currently running their pre-launch campaign during which 30% of the initial airdrop will be allocated and then in phase 2 they will be allocating another 30% of the initial airdrop as liquidity mining incentives.\n\nThis proposal suggests depositing a smaller amount of idle ALCX (1.5k ALCX - $30k) from the treasury to take advantage of the initial airdrop allocation phases, as well as continue using the protocol to earn on the ALCX tokens as long as it remains beneficial.\n\nFyde succeeding is beneficial for Alchemix, as it supports the ALCX token, and so it would be useful for us to have a smaller ownership stake in the protocol.\n\nThe protocol has been audited by Halborn and is run by a public team.\n\n### Voting\nVoting is single-choice.\n\n1. A **yes** vote approves the deployment of 1.5k ALCX into Fyde protocol\n2. A **no** vote signals that no funds should be deployed into Fyde protocol\n3. Abstain",

      "title": "[AIP 100] AMO Harvest Framework Update",
      "content": "# Proposal\nThe current allocation for AMO harvests is as follows:\n1. 1/3rd to the treasury in the form of ETH/stables\n2. 1/3rd to the treasury in the form of liquidity driving assets\n3. 1/3rd to buy ALCX and bribe for liquidity\n\nThis framework was implemented with AIP-80: https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/394-aip-80-elixir-amo-buyback-and-bribe\n\nIn light of the multichain exploit, curve exploit, and bug bounty, this proposal seeks to revise the allocation as follows, to be in effect until the launch of veALCX (expected EOY):\n1. Up to 100% to the treasury in the form of ETH/stables\n2. Remainder may be used for liquidity-driving assets\n\nThe treasury is currently overbalanced to locked liquidity-driving assets. The intent of this proposal is to extend the runway and rebalance towards ETH and stables.\n\n# Context\nAlchemix DAO is authorized to spend up to 450k/quarter per AIP-40: https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/296-aip-40-alchemix-core-budget-request. The DAO has never exceeded this spending limit since its inception. Audits are typically the only reason the spending gets close to the limit. \n\nWith the ongoing alETH situation, the protocol is only earning income from the alUSD AMO. Currently, 1/3rd of the alUSD AMO revenue is sufficient to cover the quarterly budget, but with little-to-no headroom. At current ALCX prices, it also requires continuing to spend ALCX from the treasury to maintain the necessary emissions. \n\nAs a result of the multichain exploit, significant stablecoin runway was converted to AMO funds via AIP 95a: https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/429-aip-95a-multichain-response-optimism-and-arbitrum. A similar solution is expected for alETH. This conversion means these funds are now backing L2 alAssets and therefore cannot be sold for expenses. \n\nThe current status of the stolen multichain assets remain unknown. If these funds are eventually recovered or lost forever, then the L2 AMO can be converted back to protocol-owned liquidity, and the treasury would be well funded. However, if these funds are circulating then the treasury is currently heavily overweight on liquidity-driving assets. \n\nAs noted above, the protocol is currently self-sustaining but this does not leave room for expansion and becomes an issue if the bear market continues and treasury asset prices drop more. This proposal aims to create a larger runway so that future products/expansions of Alchemix are able to be funded after the launch of veALCX. \n\nNote that the expected final round of the veALCX audit begins Oct 30th. The core contracts are done, and devs are working on the “nice to haves” while waiting for the final audit slot. The UI work is well underway and is aiming to be ready for community testing next month. \n\n# Voting\nFor - Approve revised AMO harvest framework\nAgainst - Do not approve the revised AMO harvest framework",

      "content": "## IMPORTANT\nRead this snapshot for the final version of the proposal. The forum and the PRE-AIP describe a previous state of the project.\n\n## PRE-AIP\n[ALCHEMIX FORUM ORIGINAL](https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/418-multi-tenant-vedao-launchpad/3)\n[SNAPSHOT SIGNAL PRE-AIP](https://snapshot.org/#/alchemixedopinions.eth/proposal/0x0cacdb52cba302f2f8c74fdec4b3629aec17d814d5a3644e98c8aac964ec7148)\n## GRANT REQUEST: 15 ETH\n1. 5 ETH to [SHIZZY](https://twitter.com/ShizzyAizawa) to create a 420 NFT Collection on Mainnet.\n- +2.5% Commission of Mainnet Collection to Shizzy.\n2. Alchemix Treasury contributes 10 ETH to Silo Treasury.\n- Alchemix Treasury receives 10,000 SILO Tokens at Fair Launch Price.\n- 0% Fees to Silo | DAOhaus.\n3. Both Payments are made in Milestones:\n- Half up front\n- Half on delivery of Mainnet Collection.\n\n## Context\nAlchemistrisses is a NFT Collection, which is also a veALCX club.\n\nA NFT Community-Owned | Moloch Treasury for veALCX.\n\nAfter the raise, funds will be used as follows:\n1. Deposit Collateral into Alchemix and borrow alUSD.\n2. Buy 80ALCX-20wETH LP to deposit into Balancer.\n3. Buy and Lock AURA to vote for emissions to be directed to 80ALCX-20wETH LP.\n4. Perma-Lock veALCX\n\nSilo developers use transaction builder to create this as a multi-call, in order to streamline DAO setup.\n\nDAO benefits:\n\n- Raise ALCX and ETH to deposit into Balancer 80/20 LP.\n- Acquire Bribes | Yield from veALCX while underlying loan is repaid.\n- Maximize Yield by permalocking.\n- Accumulate ALCX | FLUX.\n- Individual Members can exit positions by selling NFT on Secondary.\n- Involve the NFT Community in veALCX | Get some cool artwork for Memes.\n\nThis project is a novel experiment, and a synergy between:\n- Gnosis Safe\n- Moloch v3\n- ERC 6651\n- Aura | Balancer\n- Alchemix\n- Chainlink VRF\n- Shizzy\n\nCIRCUMVENTING FLUX:\n\n“Circumventing FLUX with this one weird trick!”\n\nThe Moloch DAO will be able to exit from their veALCX exposure by selling their NFT on secondary markets.\n\nThis also means that the veALCX inside of the DAO treasury can be perpetually locked, and the FLUX can be burned, and used for boosted Yield.\n\nThis means that the members of the DAO will earn the highest boosted yields, while still being able to exit from their exposure via secondary market NFT Sales.\n\nThe DAO could also horde FLUX, and use it to exit as a group during the next bull market.\n\nSELF-REPAYING LP DIRECTING ASSETS:\n\nLocked veTokens carry a time-risk; Alchemix loans offer strategies, which help mitigate that risk.\n\nBy initially depositing raised funds into Alchemix and taking out a loan, the DAO gives themselves a chance to recoup liquidity spent on veTokens.\n\nSilo will create multi-call transaction patterns to streamline these strategies, and offer them to other communities.\n\nSilo can also deploy to OP | ARB | BASE | MAINNET.\n\nEach chain has clusters of projects would benefit coordinating around their Liquidity Needs, and Alchemix Vaults can help them meet their objectives.\n\nOnce the veALCX Moloch DAO is shipped – we can evaluate launching a collection to support alETH -ETH LP on Velodrome.\n\nTREASURY MANAGEMENT:\n\nNFTs from each collection own Economic and Governance Rights to the treasury.\n\n- The Mainnet DAO could manage yield, or actively manage Alchemix LP.\n- A future OP DAO could hedge alETH-ETH LP on Kwenta | Lyra.\n- Set it and Forget It, is also possible, where the veALCX rewards accumulate until ALCX Moons and it’s time to exit.\n\nSilo is basically a Moloch DAO built on top of a Gnosis Safe – so, any transaction that you could do using Gnosis Safe, would be possible.\n\nRAGEQUIT:\n\nThe Moloch DAO structure makes this a veALCX Multi-Player Investment Game.\n\nThe DAO will decide how to manage their FLUX, as well as when to sell their veALCX.\n\nWhen the DAO passes a proposal to dissolve the treasury, each NFT can be burned to claim their share.\n\nROYALTIES TO DAO TREASURY:\n\nSecondary Sales allow royalties to be absorbed by the DAO.\n\nEconomic and Governance rights are transferred to the new holder, since these rights belong to the Token Bound Account of that NFT. – This is the Function provided by ERC 6651.\n\nSecondary Sales volume ought to be driven by the veALCX permalock, and boosted yield FLUX position of the DAO.\n\nSudoswap LP Integration is also a great option here.\n\nSilo UPDATES:\n\nSince pitching to Alchemix, we have structured our own Moloch DAO, and funded development.\n\nWe offer two products:\n\n1. Silo: Core is the Launchpad which will release the Alchemistresses\n- Silo: Core will include Chainlink VRF for the Mainnet Collection.\n2. Moloch RDF is a public good outreach tool, which airdrops Moloch DAO Shares to the Token Bound Accounts, of currently existing NFT Communities.\n- Built in Partnership with Tokenbound.\n\nMoloch RDF will be ready in a month, and we are doing outreach to partners currently, as well as working with Tokenbound.\n\nSilo: Core will be ready by end of October, along with Chainlink VRF integration for Mainnet.\n\nIf veALCX ships after Halloween, and the artwork is ready, Alchemistresses can ship on Mainnet as a part of veALCX launch.\n\nSILO Fair Launch | Yeeter Period:\n\nSince the PRE-AIP Signal Vote, we have raised enough ETH to fund development.\n\n- 12.5 ETH from Founders\n- 12 ETH from DAOhaus Treasury | PublicHAUS\n\nWe are currently in Fair Launch, selling SILO to partner treasuries to extend our runway, and build some case studies.\n\nYeet funds pay for:\n\n- Development\n- Sales\n- DAO owned LP\n- veVELO\n\nThe Fair Launch period is a way for us to grassroots fundraise the project while offering SILO ownership to partners.\n\nWe ask that the Alchemix Treasury act as both a Case Study, and a Seed Round Contributor.\n\nSILO Distribution:\n\nSILO has a fixed Max Supply of 1,000,000, and is on Optimism.\nhttps://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x36138bb223ffe0c69d99b5affc07800aa3f9e346#balances\n\nCurrently, the only way to get SILO is to contribute ETH to the Yeeter:\nInfo: https://silo.haus/\nYeeter: https://join.silohaus.eth.limo/\n\nDetails and proposals are available using Moloch v3 Frontend:\nDAO Hub: https://admin.daohaus.fun/#/molochv3/0xa/0x7551eeb016d0c1c8315611053d30bd90d1a4b09b\nThere is no initial Team Distribution, founders all bought SILO via the Yeeter.\n\nSILO supply has also been earmarked for LP and Bribes on Velodrome.\n\nSilo aims to launch a network of DAO Treasuries, each with their own purpose, and community. Silo could be distributed to these treasuries as well, in the form of treasury swaps.\n\nTreasury Swaps would create a “LOOT Index” within Silo’s treasury, creating Ragequitable Floor Volatility.\n\nSILO RFV:\n\nSilo Currently has two Treasuries:\n\n- The Main Treasury is Rage Quitable.\n- The Arsenal is our Operations Budget.\n- https://admin.daohaus.fun/#/molochv3/0xa/0x7551eeb016d0c1c8315611053d30bd90d1a4b09b/safes\nLOOT Tokens are an under-explored and novel use case of Moloch v3.\n\nSILO tokens are LOOT tokens, meaning SILO can be burned for a pro-rata share of the main Treasury.\n\nHere are some sources for Potential Treasury Growth:\n\n- 2.5% of Gross Funds raised for Clients | Partners\n- Yield bearing Assets | Staked DAO owned LP\n- Treasury Swaps to create “LOOT Index”\nThese tokens are proportionally claimable by burning SILO, creating a RFV.\n\nThe Fee Switch:\n\nAt some point, we will turn off the Fair Launch, turn on 10% Fees for each launch, and list SILO on Velodrome with DAO owned Liquidity.\n\n2.5% of each Launch will be directed into a treasury owned by SILO holders, and tokens can be burned for their proportional share of this ETH.\n\nRemaining 7.5% per raise will go toward:\n- 2.5% to SILO / wETH LP\n- 2.5% to DAOhaus Treasury\n- 2.5% to Founders\n\nArtist Commission % will be added on a per campaign basis, but will likely be an additional 2.5%.\n\n## CALL TO ACTION\n- Alchemix Pilots Silo: Core on Mainnet.\n- SHIZZY gets started on the 420 piece Collection, while Silo Developers prepare for Launch.\n\nVote APPROVE:\n\n- Alchemix Treasury issues out 2.5 ETH to Shizzy Now.\n- Alchemix Treasury issues out 2.5 ETH to Shizzy on Completion.\n- Alchemix Treasury contributes 5 ETH to Silo Treasury Now, and receives 5,000 SILO tokens.\n- Alchemix Treasury contributes 5 ETH to Silo Treasury on Completion, and receives 5,000 SILO tokens.\n\nProject moves forward, and we aim for a VRF enabled Mainnet Collection by veALCX Launch – Artwork done by Shizzy.\n\nVote REJECT:\n\nDo not fund project.\n\nVote ABSTAIN",

      "content": "### Summary\nExpand the relationship between Alchemix and Vesper to incorporate Vesper L2 and LSD products with the intention of continuing to prioritize one another through synergistic buildouts into the future.\n\n### Proposal\n- Authorize Mainnet Vesper stETH and rETH pools as Alchemix alETH vaults with deposit caps of 250 ETH each.\n- Authorize Optimism Vesper USDC and wstETH pools as Alchemix alUSD/alETH vaults with deposit caps of 500,000 USD/250 ETH, respectively.\n- Each pool will carry the following variables:\n\nEthereum stETH\n\n1. maxLoss() of 200 bps (based on stETH to ETH price)\n2. harvest() threshold of 0.5 ETH\n3. repay() threshold of  Infinite per 10 min \n4. liquidation() threshold of Infinite per 10 min\n\nEthereum rETH\n\n1. maxLoss() of 200 bps (based on rETH to ETH price)\n2. harvest() threshold of 0.5 ETH\n3. repay() threshold of  Infinite per 10 min\n4. liquidation() threshold of Infinite per 10 min\n\nOptimism USDC\n\n1. maxLoss() of 5 bps\n2. harvest() threshold of 250 USDC\n3. repay() threshold of 500,000 per 10 min\n4. liquidation() threshold of 500,000 per 10 min\n\nOptimism wstETH\n\n1. maxLoss() of 200 bps (based on rETH to ETH price)\n2. harvest() threshold of 0.25 ETH\n3. repay() threshold of  Infinite per 10 min\n4. liquidation() threshold of Infinite per 10 min\n\nAdditionally, the protocols will continue to strategize and collaborate on future endeavors.\n\n### Background/Motivation\nSeveral Vesper pools (DAI, USDC, ETH) were incorporated into Alchemix over recent months. In particular, the USDC pool has gotten good engagement from depositors due to our higher APY offered.\n\nAfter discussing with the Alchemix team and learning about upcoming developments and focuses, we believe there are two areas where Vesper and Alchemix can continue to cooperate in the immediate future: LSDs and L2’s.\n\nVesper offers an interesting product on top of LSDs: We support the major players (stETH, cbETH, rETH) in our Vesper Grow pools. This product provides what we like to call “APY+” - depositors of these tokens keep 100% of their staking APY plus extra yield generated through DeFi activity (ex: borrowing stablecoins from Aave and LPing them onto Curve). \n\nWe believe these pools are exciting for Alchemix due to a premium APY offered without carrying too much extra risk - we avoid LPing the LSDs outright to avoid IL and the strategies used only expand to the blue chip protocols that other Vesper pools interface with.\n\nAdditionally, we can help to drive engagement through L2’s like Optimism and Arbitrum due to our ability to spin up yield sources in a way that is feasible for both Vesper and Alchemix from an engineering perspective (Alchemix already built the Vesper adapter. Vesper can fork mainnet strategies/pools freely).\n\nBeyond that, our ability to capture grant funding could offer highly competitive total yield to Alchemix users.\n\n### Future Opportunities\nIn addition to the above, there are a number of opportunities where Vesper (and our sister protocol, Metronome) can further create exciting products for Alchemix, particularly surrounding the miscellaneous alAssets:\n- Vesper can offer alUSD and alETH pools, which can provide LP and compound yield through Curve/Convex/Frax.\n- Those alAsset Vesper pools can be incorporated as collateral onto Metronome, allowing users of these pools to participate in looping yield strategies.\n- Synthetic Metronome assets (msUSD and msETH) can be paired with alAssets as LP pools for co-incentivized liquidity opportunities.\n\nOnce market conditions improve, and TVL increases, Vesper also offers a partner revenue share program which can drive additional revenue to Alchemix (so far, current TVL translates to negligible fees, but higher TVL drives revenue directly & enables higher revenue sharing).\n\n### Voting\n- FOR: confirm the specifications above\n- AGAINST: do nothing\n\n",

      "title": "[AIP-91] Alchemix Quick Frontend Tool Grant",
      "content": "# Proposal:\nTo create a simple frontend tool to quickly create an Alchemix position and take a loan back to the chosen asset.\n\nThe tool would enable a user to follow this flow:\n\n1. select deposit asset (ETH, stablecoins).\n2. select yield strategy (yield strategy options should be based on the deposit asset the user selects). [Reference Contracts](https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/user-docs/contracts)\n3. select loan asset (the contract/frontend will swap the alAsset to the selected asset, alAssets would also be an option. MVP of the product would be to spit out alAssets.)\n4. select loan amount, denominated in the loan asset (contract/frontend would need to calculate the loan amount based on the max alETH credit available from the new deposit as well as any existing deposit, and account for slippage from the alAsset to the desired asset of choice).\n\nThe flow should occur in as few transactions as possible - ideally a single multicall transaction.\n\nThe most technical aspect of this proposal is step 4 - in terms of how to calculate slippage and ensure proper swap routing is being utilized, as well as ensuring transactions will not be front-run / sandwiched through alETH price manipulation. The swap from alAssets to other assets is a step that will require either on or off chain calculations/routers, or hard coding swap paths.\n\nIt is debatable if this should be included, or if the tool is good without it. Ie, the front end itself could integrate 1inch or Paraswap and run the calculations, instead of doing it within the contract.\n\nThe UI should give users the option to skip steps 3 and 4. UI should let users mint their max credit, not just what they deposit (i.e., if they already have an Alchemix position, it should take that into account when offering a maximum mint).\n\nGoal is to keep the UI as simple as possible, like a uniswap style of simplicity. The goal is to let users quickly and easily create an Alchemix position and take a loan, but then they go to the main Alchemix website to manage their loan with more power (self liquidations, withdraws, repays, etc).\n\n# Milestones:\n1. Minimum Viable Product\n       a. Build a functional and secure tool (contracts, if necessary, and front end) that allows users to deposit to Alchemix and mint up to the maximum alAsset loan available in a single multicall transaction. ($2k paid inALCX)\n2. Functional integration\n     a. Update the tool based on feedback and reviews as necessary to be compliant with the spec, follow Alchemix branding, have good UI/UX, etc.\n     b. Add functionality to the tool to find swap paths and execute the swap through onchain function call as part of the single multicall transaction. ($4k paid in ALCX)\n\n# Review/KPIs/Other Considerations\n1. Alchemix core team will review the tool. Payment for each milestone will be sent once review comments have been addressed in a manner deemed satisfactory.\n2. Alchemix will reimburse gas expenses for deployments and on-chain tests as necessary, within reason.\n3. Alchemix will host the tool and link to it through the Utilities page.\n4. If additional ALCX payment is necessary (due to scope creep, or to reward good work) it will be sourced from the BizGov multisig, which is funded through a portion of core team emissions.\n\n# Introduction:\nThis is an individual contributor, who did contribute to other DeFi and NFT projects in the last 4 years, and even in some projects worked as a solidity lead developer. While I’m an experienced smart contract developer, I’m also strong at frontend/backend development as well. Happy to join and contribute to Alchemix DAO through this system.\n\nKindly check my background over here.\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/solflare\n Github: https://github.com/defigods\n\nDeFi teams I worked with before.\nhttps://palmswap.org/\nhttps://composable.finance/\n\n(Proposal submitted by iccream on the forums) \n\nVoting:\nFOR: Fund the grant\nAGAINST: Do not fund\nABSTAIN",

      "title": "[AIP-88] PancakeSwap trial and emissions allocation update",
      "content": "### Proposal\n\n1. Allocate $30k worth of ALCX to two new PancakeSwap pools, alETH-ETH and alETH-ALCX.\n2. Acknowledge and accept the current changed allocation of emissions and the temporary emissions framework.\n\n### Context\nALCX emissions have not had an official change in allocation for the last 9 months. During that time, there have been a number of changes in the Alchemix protocol. Given these changes, this proposal seeks to account for all governance changes and multisig adjustments as well as start a trial with PancakeSwap. It also proposes an allocation framework for the multisig until veALCX launches. The sections below go through each specific topic.\n\nAlso, please note, that in previous AIPs, emissions were set by governance based on a total percentage going to each location. However, some of the agreements and mechanics of certain pools made it necessary to maintain a constant amount of rewards, which meant that these gauges are making up an increasingly higher percentage of total emissions as time passes, because of the constantly falling ALCX emissions. The most notable of these is the Curve pools, for which the weekly bribes are constant. This is beneficial to the protocol, as the value returned from bribes is approximately equal to or greater than the value put in due to the Elixir AMOs. For more information about the rate of emission change, refer to https://alchemix-stats.com and select the “ALCX emissions” tab.\nAs a result, we are specifying some gauges in terms of percentage and others in terms of a constant amount of ALCX.\n### PancakeSwap\nThe possibility of setting up alAsset pools on PancakeSwap and receiving co-incentives from them is what prompted this proposal. Given that we are doing well regarding alUSD liquidity mainly because of the FRAX Base Pool pairing, when discussing incentivizing liquidity pools with the PancakeSwap team, we proposed solely alETH pools to be set up in PancakeSwap.\n\n\nFor alETH liquidity on Mainnet, we currently have no partners with whom we co-incentivize pools, so this would be the first such step in that direction.\n\nPancakeSwap launched on Ethereum Mainnet, and they agreed that they would provide initial marketing for our pools.\n\nThe proposal calls for two pools to be set up, an alETH-ETH and and ALCX-alETH pool, for a trial period of two months, committing $30k worth of ALCX tokens for the pools combined, heavily weighted towards the alETH-ETH pool.\n\nShould the trial be successful, the multisig would seek to make the change permanent, and would decide at that point if emissions to the alETH Curve pool should be reduced by an equal amount, or if the additional emissions from the trial are needed to maintain desirable liquidity levels.\n### Fantom\nA lot has changed on Fantom since the initial launch. SpiritSwap bribes had become detrimental to use, as we were paying more in ALCX bribes than the dollar value of emissions that were going to the pools were worth. For this reason, emissions to SpiritSwap were stopped completely.\n\nGiven that interest in Alchemix has not really picked up on Fantom, the amount of overall emissions going to the chain proved to be too high. As such, emissions going both to SpookySwap for gALCX liquidity, as well as to Beethoven X for alUSD liquidity, were reduced to 80 ALCX/week and 200 ALCX/week respectively. The alUSD pool was essentially stopped as a result of a possible attack vector on Beethoven. Beethoven will indicate to Alchemix when the alUSD pool is ready to restart.\n### alAssets on Curve\nThe largest change percentage-wise happened in the Curve alAsset pools. In order to maintain sufficient liquidity, emissions to Curve pools have been kept largely stable at 2000 ALCX/week for alETH-ETH and alUSD-FRAXBP, and 250 ALCX/week for alUSD-3CRV, even with constantly dropping emissions. This means that since the last emission update, the percentage of emissions going to curve pools has increased considerably.\n### General Multisig rights\nWhen veALCX launches veALCX holders will vote on gauges to direct emissions. In practice, the goal is that this replaces the need to maintain emissions breakdowns for approved liquidity pools. However, there would likely still be a need to run some flat-rate bribes as well as multi-week trials of new pools. The intent is that governance can still dictate some % of emissions to go to the treasury, as well as dictate the spending of the treasury for flat rate bribes and/or trials. At the conclusion of trials, governance could vote to add the pools as a gauge, perhaps including bribes for veALCX holders from the partner.\n\nHowever, there might be smaller changes that need to be made until the launch of veALCX, and the multisig would like to have a certain level of discretion in making these changes without the need to go through governance. The following framework is proposed:\n\nThe Alchemix dev multisig is allowed to adjust ALCX emissions among the pools specified in this AIP to any reasonable degree that it deems to be most efficient, and said Alchemix dev multisig is allowed to allocate a maximum of 1000 ALCX/week to new gauges or pools on top of the total emissions defined in this proposal without consulting governance. At a minimum of 48 hours prior to any adjustment to ALCX emissions being made pursuant to this AIP, the pending ALCX emissions will be announced in the main Alchemix discord in the #governance-proposals channel in order to give active users an opportunity to comment and in order to give active users an opportunity to make any adjustments that they need to make. These permissions for the Alchemix dev multisig to adjust ALCX emissions without governance will sunset at the end of calendar year 2023 UTC OR when veALCX launches, whichever comes sooner, unless governance votes to extend these permissions.\n\n### Summary\nThe currently defined distribution of emissions is as follows:\n\n- ALCX-ETH Balancer pool: 20% (Upon [AIP-82-A] execution)\n- gALCX: 13%\n- Saddle alETH: 2%\n- Going to treasury: 65%\n\nTreasury ALCX is split among the below gauges:\n\n- alETH-ETH Curve: 2000 ALCX/week\n- alUSD-FRAXBP Curve: 2000 ALCX/week\n- alUSD-3CRV Curve: 250 ALCX/week\n- L2D4 Arbitrum: $2k/week\n- Beethoven X alUSD-USDC: 80 ALCX/week\n- SpookySwap gALCX-FTM: 200 ALCX/week\n\nAs per the proposal, the Pancakeswap alETH-ETH & ALCX/alETH pools would receive $30k worth of ALCX from the treasury for the 2-month trial period.\n\nIt is important to note, that these percentages only utilize the base emissions, and they do not contain the ALCX rebates that the protocol receives as bribes from voting for our own pools.\n### Voting\nVoting is single-choice.\n\n1. A choice of “Approval” accepts the percentage-wise change of emissions, the temporary emissions framework and greenlights the trial to deploy two alETH pools on PancakeSwap on Ethereum mainnet.\n2. A choice of “Disapproval” rejects the current emission distribution and calls for a discussion and a new proposal on a different path forward.\n3. Abstain",

      "title": "[AIP-87] Launch Alchemix-Premia options pools",
      "content": "### Proposal\nThis proposal seeks governance approval to collaborate with Premia Finance and launch a joint options pool product. It also proposes a treasury swap of $50k to take place between the two protocols.\n### Alchemix dev requirements\n\n1. Launch custom Alchemists that can mint 100% LTV alAsset loans to a whitelisted contract.\n2. Develop a UI. This is proposed to happen through a grant.\n\n### Context\nWhen alAssets are taken out as loans, depositors usually swap these tokens to other assets, like DAI, USDC, ETH, etc., in order to realize the value of their loans. This happens through alAsset liquidity pools. Alchemix uses ALCX emissions and bribes to provide rewards to these LPs, so that people have incentives to become liquidity providers in these pools, which is a huge expense.\n\nA long-term goal of the protocol is to find direct use-cases for alAssets, so that instead of entering the liquidity pools, they can more readily be deployed elsewhere. This makes it cheaper for the protocol to finance operations.\n\nOne such use-case is the alETH/alUSD options pool on Premia Finance (read more about Premia here: [https://premia.finance](https://premia.finance)), where users can provide liquidity to an alETH call pool or an alUSD put pool, and traders can buy options to go long or short on the performance of ETH.\n\nThere is a conundrum regarding alAssets: If someone has the option to earn x% of yield on ETH or on USDC, why would they choose alETH or alUSD to earn the same amount of yield on. So somehow, the yields need to be higher on alAssets for people to choose them, or need to have some added benefit.\n\nThis product aims to do just that through options pools. Users may wish to purchase alETH and alUSD options because the premiums are lower and alETH and alUSD option pool writers are willing to accept lower premiums because they are earning yield on their 100% LTV Alchemix loans.\n### The Alchemix-Premia Options Vault\nThe proposed way to incentivize depositors to enter an alAsset denominated options pool is to allow higher LTV alAsset loans to be minted with the restriction that the alAssets can only be deployed as liquidity in the corresponding options vault.\n\nSo, while a depositor could take a 50% alETH loan, swap it to ETH and deploy that in an ETH-denominated options vault, with this proposed options pool, a depositor could instead take a 100% alETH loan and deploy that in the alETH-denominated options pool.\n\nBecause the alAssets are never given to the depositors and instead are controlled by a smart contract, the alAssets are not sold and remain in the premia liquidity pools. This also means that the loan cannot be looped an infinite amount of times, like it would be possible with a \"normal\" loan. Additionally, it is extremely difficult to lose 100% of capital by writing options - thus, 100% LTV loans would not create a massive surplus in alAssets if the options pools did not go in the LP’s favor. The worst performance on Premia for any of their pools has been -17% since inception, as can be seen in [this list](https://defillama.com/yields?project=premia&showInceptionApy=true) under the \"Inception APY\" column.\n(To note, there are pools that have larger negative returns that do not show up in this list, but those are very small pools that are very underutilized, which can result in very large negative performances)\n\nThis actually supercharges returns for options liquidity providers, as they will earn yield from multiple sources:\n\n1. Their base deposit is deployed in an Alchemix strategy (i.e. stETH or yvDai), which  continues to self-repay the depositor’s loan.\n2. The full capital is also deployed as alETH or alUSD in the options pool, collecting options premiums.\n3. PREMIA emissions can also be sent to the pool that depositors can collect, more on this below.\n\nAs with options products, there is the possibility of the pools generating negative returns, if traders win. But generally, long term, the pools are expected to provide positive returns.\n\nHowever, this joint product has a huge further upside for depositors: Even if in the theoretical scenario of the options pool losing a 100% of the capital, users will still have their full initial capital earning yield in the Alchemix strategy. So even with a net position of zero, they would be accruing yield, though, of course, they would not be able to remove their initial collateral until the loan is repaid.\n### Alchemix Premia position and PREMIA rewards\nTo supercharge depositor returns (and to compete with other Premia pools), PREMIA rewards should be directed to the alETH/alUSD pool. This can be done by vxPREMIA holders directing emissions there.\n\nSo the establishment of an Alchemix vxPREMIA (locked PREMIA) position is proposed.\nAlchemix currently holds $20k worth of PREMIA tokens and a treasury swap is proposed between the two protocols to the tune of $50k.\nAlchemix would lock their whole position and direct PREMIA rewards to our pool.\n\nFurther, a set percentage of the PREMIA rewards that are emitted to the users of this product would be collected and locked by Alchemix, increasing the voting power and thus the value of emissions to the alETH/alUSD pool.\n### Motivation\nThis product is beneficial for Alchemix because we:\n\n1. Capture TVL without having to pay incentives for it, which makes these vaults net profitable.\n2. Options traders purchase the alAssets from the market that they need to pay for their position, which generates buy pressure and also additional volume.\n3. Alchemix can continuously accumulate a position in Premia.\n\nTo better illustrate the potential significance for Alchemix, if the vaults took off, take the following example:\nCurrent Premia reward yields to the most richly rewarded pools are 40%+ APR. If the alETH/alUSD pool stabilizes at just 10% and Alchemix claims and locks 20% of the rewards, that results in a 2% APR for the treasury on the deposit base. So comparing that with our basic Alchemix loans:\n\n- Assuming a 5% yield on the deposits, Alchemix collects a 0.5% APR from the treasury cut.\n- For this product, the same 0.5% APR is collected on the vaults, plus the 2% from Premia rewards, generating 5 times as much revenue on the same amount of deposits. On top of that, the minted alAssets do not need to be financed by Alchemix and if the vaults have a positive return, it actually removes additional alAssets from the market.\n\nThis product is beneficial for Premia for the following reasons:\n\n1. The ability to offer liquidity providers the option to route their deposits through Alchemix and generate additional yield.\n2. Capture additional TVL.\n3. A large chunk of PREMIA emissions to the alETH/alUSD pool are essentially locked for good by Alchemix and not sold on the market\n\nPremia would develop and deploy the smart contract that is able to deposit to the custom Alchemist, mint alAssets, deploy to the Premia pool, handle rewards and process withdrawals.\n\nAlchemix would create a UI for the product that would be linked to from the main UI.\n\nDeployment is currently targeted to take place on either the Arbitrum or Optimism networks utilizing Premia’s new V3 system.\n### Voting options\nVoting is single-choice.\n\n1. A vote of approval greenlights the deployment of the custom Alchemist and whitelisting of the smart contract, the grant for the development of the UI and the $50k treasury swap between Alchemix and Premia.\n2. A vote of disapproval signals that this product should not be enabled by Alchemix.\n3. Abstain\n\n\n### Appendix: Options protocol introduction\nThis intro to crypto options focuses on Premia largely due to their interest, past partnerships, liquidity incentives and the presence of an alUSD and alETH options market, but most other crypto options platforms work based on similar principle where variations of this product could be enabled if the product is successful.\n\nThere are two basic types of options:\n\n1. **PUT options**: These give the holder the right (but not the obligation) to sell the asset (in this case alETH) for which the option was purchased at a price set at the time of purchase.\nExample: alETH price is $1300. Someone buys a PUT option (for a price, called the premium) with a strike price of $1200 and a set expiration date.\nThen if the price of alETH falls to $1000, the holder can exercise the option to realize the $200 difference, essentially buying alETH for $1000 and then selling it for $1200. In practice the system tracks the value of the option and automatically pays out the difference.\nIf the price of alETH at the time of expiration is higher than $1200, the option expires worthless.\n2. **CALL options**: These give the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy the asset (in this case alETH) for which the option was purchased at a price set at the time of purchase.\nExample: alETH price is $1300. Someone buys a CALL option (for a price, called the premium) with a strike price of $1400 and a set expiration date.\nThen if the price of alETH rises to $1600, the holder can exercise the option to realize the $200 difference, essentially buying alETH for $1400 and then selling it for $1600. In practice the system tracks the value of the option and automatically pays out the difference.\nIf the price of alETH at the time of expiration is lower than $1400, the option expires worthless.\n\nOn the other side of the trade are the option sellers, who (for a premium) take on the obligation to sell or buy the underlying asset at the strike price.\n\nThis happens using liquidity pools in crypto. Option sellers (also called the underwriters and liquidity providers here) deposit their funds into an options liquidity pool (in this case the alETH/alUSD pool) and traders can buy options from this liquidity pool. CALL options are denominated in the tracked asset (alETH), PUT options are denominated in USD (alUSD). So the sellers (liquidity providers) deposit either alETH or alUSD into the liquidity pool, depending on which option they want to underwrite.\nThis is different from options in traditional finance as everything is denominated in USD (or fiat currencies).\nThe reason for the difference here, is because this is how it can be ensured, that however the price of the tracked asset changes, there is always enough liquidity to pay out the options buyers.\nFor PUT pools, the payout amount (the price difference between the strike price and the price of the asset), at a maximum is the strike price itself, as the price of an asset cannot drop below 0.\nFor CALL pools, the payout amount (the price difference between the strike price and the price of the asset) can be infinite, as there is no cap for the price gain of the tracked asset. However, because the denomination is in the asset itself, wherever it rises to, the amount of available liquidity rises at the same pace, so the payout can always take place.\n\nGenerally, because the buyers pay a premium, the price of an asset needs to move at least as much as the premium they paid in a given direction for them to realize any profits, so long term, sellers (liquidity providers) expect the amount of premiums that they collect for underwriting to surpass the amount of money they have to pay when buyers “win”.\n\nBuyers are generally either speculating on price movements and are getting access to leveraged returns without the downside, or are hedging their own portfolio against larger movements.\n\nTo learn more about options, Premia has 2 articles that provide more details:\n[What are Options: Calls and Puts](https://blog.premia.finance/what-are-options-calls-and-puts-4eb7963554e) and [DeFi Options 101](https://blog.premia.finance/defi-options-101-bbbc03f05d63)",

      "title": "[AIP-86 B] Expanding ETH2 LSD Caps",
      "content": "Out of the approximately 19,000 ETH deposited in Alchemix, around 15,000 is allocated in Yearn yvWETH. While we acknowledge Yearn's security and value, their yields are outperformed by LSD tokens, which generate over twice the returns of yvWETH. The current yvWETH cap is 17,000 and stETH is 3,000; however, given the existing borrowing levels, the alETH price remains below target. Increasing caps would only aggravate this issue.\n\nTaking community feedback into account, many yvWETH holders express interest in depositing into the stETH vault. To facilitate a win-win scenario enabling current depositors to migrate without impacting the alETH price, we propose the following strategy. With the upcoming Shanghai hardfork, we anticipate that LSD pegs should maintain a 1:1 ratio going forward due to the free arbitrage opportunities for any price fluctuations below the price of ETH. Consequently, transitioning the majority of our vault capacity to ETH2 tokens is now a prudent and secure decision.\n\nEach week, the team will issue a 24-hour notice before raising the caps. Initially, this information will be exclusively shared on Discord to give priority to community members' migration opportunities. At the specified time, we will increase the caps by 1,200 ETH in total for the three LSDs available in Alchemix (wstETH, rETH, and frxETH). Based on user preferences, we will adjust the vault cap increases accordingly, resulting in a total increase of 1,200 ETH for each session. The operational team will maintain frequent communication with the community via Discord to coordinate this effort. Vault increases for cap raises will occur sporadically, aligning with the best times for interested participants. This proposal authorizes the migration up to a maximum ETH vault increase of an additional 10,000 ETH2 tokens, while simultaneously reducing the yvWETH deposit cap in accordance with the migrations.\n\nTo keep the team informed, we kindly ask users to complete an anonymous and private form, indicating the amount of yvWETH they wish to migrate, their preferred ETH2 token, and a convenient time for coordination. Greater participation in this form submission will enable more effective collective decision-making.\n\nFORM: https://forms.gle/nF4epQPsopS4j4Pg7\n\nA vote \"for\" authorizes this plan for up to an eventual 10,000 ETH2 vault cap increase.\nA vote \"against\" rejects this plan.",

      "title": "[AIP-86 A] Add frxETH Strategy for alETH Alchemist",
      "content": "FRAX Finance, a distinguished partner within the decentralized finance ecosystem, has recently launched their innovative ETH2 liquid staking derivative (LSD) called Frax ETH (frxETH). This unique solution is characterized by a two-token system, wherein users depositing ETH into FRAX ETH receive frxETH, representing 1 ETH locked with FRAX's validators. To earn ETH2 rebases on their frxETH, users are required to stake it in sfrxETH.\n\nThis novel approach offers multiple benefits. Unlike stETH (wstETH) and rETH, frxETH staked in sfrxETH remains within that contract, distinguishing it from tokens that receive ETH2 rebases regardless of their utilization. Rocketpool and Lido currently face challenges as a significant portion of their token supply is being used for liquidity provision, complicating liquidity support and increasing associated costs. Furthermore, as the imbalance leans towards more LSD ETH, the rebases intensify these imbalances.\n\nThe dual-token system of frxETH addresses these issues by reducing the cost of incentivizing liquidity provision pools. FRAX supports it with convex bribes and fxs emissions, offering a specific yield at any moment. Moreover, frxETH holders can opt for simple staking or liquidity provision. This strategy eliminates the need for FRAX to incentivize the entire liquid supply of frxETH. Additionally, as liquidity providers do not earn ETH2 rebase rewards, the effective rebase rate for frxETH is higher compared to other LSDs.\n\nWe propose introducing an frxETH strategy to the Alchemix protocol. Considering its novelty and alpha vault status, we advise caution initially and suggest implementing a deposit cap of 100 frxETH for the vault. While the yields are considerably higher than stETH's, it is essential to carefully approach new contracts. In Part B of this governance proposal, we will explore increasing the frxETH cap.\n\nA vote \"for\" approves adding the frxETH strategy to Alchemix with an initial 100 fxsETH deposit limit\nA vote \"against\" rejects adding frxETH to Alchemix.",

      "title": "[AIP-85] Discretionary spending for new Liquidity Pools",
      "content": "Ensuring that sufficient liquidity is maintained for alAssets is the primary challenge for Alchemix. So far, liquidity has been restricted to stable pairs and a trial of alUSD/alETH pairing on Uniswap v3 with Arrakis. This proposal requests governance approval for $50k of discretionary funds in ALCX from the Alchemix treasury to be granted to the Bizgov subDAO to run some liquidity pilot programs. These pilot programs will spin up new pools, test how they perform, and evaluate if our liquidity costs can be reduced with some of these new pools. This would also show if these pools would cost-effectively generate enough volume for Chainlink oracles to be operated.\n### Context\nAlchemix currently operates liquidity pools in the form of alUSD<->stablecoins and alETH<->ETH.\n\nLiquidity pools need to be able to provide a certain amount of yield to incentivize people to provide liquidity. Yield comes from two distinct sources: Swap fees and incentives.\nThe larger the trading volume, the larger the swap fees.\nHowever, if there is not enough volume and consequently yield from swap fees, protocols that need a certain pool to exist usually pay incentives to LPs (Liquidity Providers) to supplement the swap fees. Protocols usually use their governance tokens for this purpose, which is mostly the case for Alchemix as well.\n\nNeedless to say, this incentivization cycle costs money, and every protocol would like for more swap fees, such that they would not have to pay to incentivize the liquidity pools.\n\nThe only swap fees that the alAsset pools currently accrue come from people taking an Alchemix loan and then swapping their alAssets to other assets, or from Alchemix depositors buying discounted alAssets to repay their loans and net a small profit in the process (this volume also generates a very small amount of additional volume in other alAsset pools to arbitrage the price difference, but this is negligible).\n\nThis means that for alAsset pools, almost all of the rewards come from liquidity incentives, paid by Alchemix (there are reward multipliers that we gain by bribing curve voters instead of using direct ALCX emissions, but this proposal does not intend to go into details on this mechanic). On Curve, alAsset pool swap fees make up ~0.2% yield, while incentives make up the rest, which ranges from ~4% to ~12%.\n\n1. There are a few different mechanics through which this could change.\nThe more use-cases alAssets receive in other protocols, the more frequently people would buy and sell them. It has been the goal of Alchemix to seek out and enable such use-cases, but there have only been a lower number of integrations to date. The BizGov subDAO will continue to work on getting alAssets onboarded in as many places as possible, but this is a continuous process.\n2. If alAsset pools are used to facilitate trades for external assets, then swap fees accrue even if traders are not trying to buy or sell the alAssets themselves. However, the current liquidity pools do not enable this use-case, as there are no pools that connect alUSD and alETH pools.\n\n### Test Pools\nThis proposal seeks governance approval to run tests to determine if by setting up pools that connect our fractured liquidity, enough volume can be generated to lower our overall incentivization costs.\n\nThe reason for the uncertainty is that volatile pools (where the two assets in the pool are expected to fluctuate in value compared to each other) require much higher reward APRs to run. So the volume that is generated by such a pool that then flows through the base alAsset pools needs to be high enough to justify the certainly higher APR that we would have to pay for the volatile pool itself.\n\nWe have run only one such test lately, through the Arrakis UniV3 alETH-alUSD pool. The learnings from this experiment are included in the appendix in the forum post for this proposal.\n\nThe first thing to identify is the right DEX(es) and protocols for the experiment. We need to be able to ensure that the pools are concentrated, while at the same time being able to provide rewards to LPs. The second is to figure out which chain (or chains) to run the experiment on, but Optimism seems like the prime candidate.\nWe also might need to test different pool compositions (alETH-alUSD, alETH-USDC, alUSD-ETH for example) and different fee tiers, so that we can identify the pool (or pools) that generate the best results.\n\n### Voting\nVoting is single-choice.\n\nThe choice of Approval allows $50k in ALCX to be spent over the course of this trial run on pool incentives chosen by the Bizgov subDAO.\nThe choice of Disapproval does not allow any funds to be spent for this purpose.\n\n1.

      "title": "[AIP-78] Deploy funds in Blueberry - revote",
      "content": "### Summary\nBlueberry is a new multi-step aggregator that enables lenders to earn passive income while borrowers are able to take advantage of on-chain leverage into their preferred yield strategy. Blueberry would like to partner with Alchemix and create custom strategy vaults for Alchemix related pools. Blueberry asks its partners to seed a lending deposit of their own tokens, and in exchange will integrate strategies in the ecosystem for leveraged deployments.\n\nIf the proposal succeeds, the Alchemix community will be able to earn low risk passive income by lending, or take more risk to earn high yields with leverage.\n\nChainlink is a seed investor in Blueberry and the protocol has been audited by multiple auditing firms including Hacken and Sherlock.\n### Proposal\nWe propose that the Alchemix DAO makes a treasury deposit of $500k worth of ALCX on Blueberry Lend [https://app.blueberry.garden/lend](https://app.blueberry.garden/lend) (URL not yet live, test deployment in progress).\n\nBlueberry will allow borrowers to borrow the tokens to enter custom automatic yield strategies, and will also support leverage into various pools for the assets.\n\nThis creates a new revenue stream for the treasury or other holders who do not wish to take any additional price risk by providing liquidity or locking their tokens. The treasury providing this liquidity will allow for the community to add leverage to their deployments.\n\nSetting up a blueberry lending market adds a source of passive yield for ecosystem token lenders that pays far higher market rates than they would receive on AAVE or Compound (projected Blueberry rate = 5-10%). All yield comes from borrower interest + bBLB emissions, net adding a significant amount of yield to the Alchemix ecosystem.\n\nIf the DAO decides to make a treasury deposit, Blueberry DAO will direct boosted bBLB emissions to the pool to create an additional yield. Estimated to be worth $20k over 2 months, which translates to a 24% APR on a deposit of $500k. After 2 months, the additional bBLB rewards are targeted to add a 3-5% bonus APR.\n\nIf this proposal passes, Blueberry is willing to enable the alAsset Curve pools (alUSD3Crv, alUSDFraxBP, alETHCrv) as possible strategies for borrowed assets, USDC, Dai and ETH. This incentivizes additional deposits into the main alAsset pools at no cost to Alchemix.\n\nBlueberry also makes it possible to insure the ALCX deposits at a very low annualized interest rate of 2% through Sherlock. Given that Blueberry (while thoroughly audited) is a new protocol, purchasing this insurance would be highly advised and is the default option should the proposal pass.\n\n### ALCX lending/borrowing\nThe ALCX deposited by the treasury would be borrowed by users and deployed in spells (strategies) operated by Blueberry, such as a 85/15 ALCX/USDC Univ3 pool.\n\nThe Blueberry ALCX market is specifically targeted at the Alchemix treasury, as the yield on the supplied ALCX will almost certainly be lower than gALCX staking, so possibly no other participants would choose to deposit. (This may change after veALCX launches and gALCX is sunset, as at that point the only option to earn native yield on ALCX would be through liquidity pools and locking the tokens)\nThis enables the Alchemix treasury to earn on its dormant ALCX without directly impacting the price of ALCX (the spells would require users to supply an equal amount of USDC/etc. to the amount of ALCX that they borrowed, thus the ALCX is not sold in the process). With the recent withdrawal from Tokemak, none of the treasury ALCX is currently deployed anywhere. The initial proposed deposit of $500k worth of ALCX is ~5% of the current treasury ALCX holdings.\n\n### Voting Options\nVoting is single-choice.\n\nThe “Approve” option greenlights the deployment of $500k treasury owned ALCX to be deployed in Blueberry and to insure the deployed assets.\nThe “Disapprove” option signals disapproval of deploying any assets into Blueberry.\n\n1.

      "title": "[AIP-82-B] Execute Strategic Acquisition of AURA",
      "content": "### **Proposal Summary**\n\nPurchase AURA, lock it, and vote for the ALCX/ETH pool.\n\n### **Context**\n\nA recent announcement from the Alchemix team outlines the plans to revamp ALCX tokenomics by turning it into a revenue generating asset through its ability to influence gauges, earn from protocol revenue, and generate FLUX. For more details see [this post](https://alchemixfi.medium.com/vealcx-update-272e8900ac5a).\n\nAs a precursor to the functionality of veALCX, the DAO will need to transition its liquidity from the current Sushi 50/50 ALCX/ETH pool to a new Balancer 80/20 ALCX/ETH Pool. This will mark the first step on the path towards a revenue-generating ALCX. Much like how the Curve ecosystem emits CRV, Balancer emits BAL to liquidity providers of its pools. The amounts of the emissions are determined by gauge votes using locked BAL (veBAL), or locked Aura (vlAURA). After creating this 80/20 Balancer pool we will be able to apply for a Balancer gauge, and all indications seem to suggest that we should have no problem passing a request for this. To this end, this proposal is being put forward, and centers around two main ideas:\n\n(1) Approval to create the 80/20 Balancer Pool, and to migrate both our current ALCX protocol-owned liquidity, and the incentives on that pool.\n(2) Approval to execute a strategic acquisition of AURA for our future gauge.\n\n### **Part 2 - Execute a Strategic Acquisition of AURA for the Treasury and reduce Tokemak exposure**\n\nBeing that we’re in a bear market, one concern may be that dormant liquidity may opt to leave the pool instead of migrating. Although this is possible, the Biz-Gov subDAO believes that this is not a good reason to delay this migration. It is, however, a good reason to introduce emissions from Balancer gauges as quickly as possible. This would not only augment yield for liquidity providers, but would also set us on the path towards one day removing ALCX emissions as yield, and replacing them entirely with alternative sources of yield that do not create sell pressure on the ALCX token (i.e., Balancer & Aura emissions, veALCX revenue, etc.) \n\nIn order to accomplish this, the Biz-Gov subDAO proposes that we begin to participate in the BAL wars by making an initial treasury purchase of AURA; which will be locked and used to direct yield to our future ALCX/ETH pool. AURA works very similarly to the way Convex works for Curve. As of the time of writing, Aura has accumulated ~23% of the total veBAL gauge power, and holders are able to use their AURA as a claim on that voting power. If this follows a similar trajectory of Convex, this stake as a percentage should increase over time. Due to the bear market, lower market cap, and shorter time in the market, AURA has a much smaller market cap than CVX, and a smaller cost of acquisition for securing a top spot among DAO holders. For example, a purchase of ~150k AURA would put Alchemix in the top 20 AURA holders according to [this source](https://www.defiwars.xyz/wars/aura) on the AURA wars.\n\nAn initial purchase of AURA would help us on two fronts:\nWe would be able to direct gauge power to the future ALCX/ETH pool so that LPs would earn yield from BAL & AURA emissions This would have the additional effect of helping to incentivize future alAsset pools, such as an alOHM/OHM pool. It may also serve as an income source on our protocol-owned liquidity.\nWe would be able to use AURA as an income source for the DAO, by collecting bribe revenue with anything that we don’t use on our pools directly. In the last voting round the yield per vote-locked AURA from bribes was ~04 cents per vlAURA. This could provide a significant income to the DAO, which could be used in the future to bolster the treasury, or to create additional revenue directed towards veALCX holders.\n\nThe next questions are how much to purchase, and where to source the funds from. According to the last financial report, (see a list of our quarterly financial reports [here](https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/user-docs/financial-reports)) the treasury holds ~260k of TOKE (currently around $360k in dollar terms). This proposal suggests we convert 50% of these assets to an equivalent dollar value of AURA. At current prices that would get us ~70k AURA. Although this would not put us in the top 10 of AURA holders from the get-go, it would give us a significant start; and with the recent AMO harvest framework passing we will have another avenue with which we can grow our stake. (For justification as to why reducing our exposure makes sense, please refer to the section below on Tokemak)\n\n### **Reducing our current exposure to Tokemak**\n\nUp until recently the Alchemix treasury had 138,840 tALCX, (~$2.08M of reactor staked ALCX) and as stated above, owns ~$360k worth of TOKE which was used to direct TOKE emissions to the ALCX reactor. ALCX from Tokemak was deployed in two places: an ALCX/tALCX pool on Curve, and the ALCX/ETH pool on Sushi.\n\nAlthough the reactors initially had relatively high APRs, they have been consistently decreasing over time. Currently the ALCX reactor has an APR of 0.6%, and this value is not expected to change by any significant degree. This means that the Alchemix treasury was earning $12.5k annually on its tALCX in return for additional smart contract risk from using Tokemak.\n\nThe portion of all ALCX deployed in the ALCX/ETH sushi pool had the additional side effects of growing the pool by ~7%, which diluted the yield for other LPs and instead allowed Tokemak to farm ALCX rewards. Given these side effects, it is hard to argue that this is greatly beneficial to Alchemix in its current form.\n\nThis is not the only reason reducing exposure makes sense. Originally Alchemix got involved with Tokemak primarily for an alUSD reactor, in hopes that the additional liquidity would help stabilize and support the value of alUSD. Unfortunately Tokemak made the decision to “temporarily'' deactivate the alUSD reactor, and it is currently unknown if the alUSD reactor will be re-enabled at any point in the future.\n\nIn light of these factors, tALCX was recently unstaked by the multisig. Given that our TOKE holdings currently provide no immediate support for Alchemix alAssets, the Biz-Gov subDAO believes it’s appropriate to reduce our exposure and fund the strategic acquisition of AURA using a portion of these funds.\n\nThe approval of this proposal will also retroactively approve the tALCX withdrawal.\n\n### Alternative Means of Strategic Purchase\nAfter much discussion in the discord certain community members expressed wanting to continue to maintain current levels of exposure to Tokemak, citing their coming V2, accTOKE yield, and depressed crypto asset prices, as reasons to continue holding the same amount of TOKE. In light of this viewpoint, we are adding an additional option expressing that the DAO use stables instead of TOKE to fund the acquisition of AURA. Although this may eat into runway during the bear, this would allow us to maintain exposure to TOKE and avoid selling.\n\n### Voting\nVoting is single-choice.\n\n1. Approve purchase using TOKE\n2. Approve purchase using stables\n3. Do not purchase AURA\n4. Abstain",

      "title": "[AIP-82-A] Approve Migration of ALCX Liquidity to Balancer",
      "content": "### **Proposal Summary** \n\n(1) Migrate ALCX/ETH POL to 80/20 Balancer/ETH pool - Utilize the full ETH from the current POL, add ALCX from the treasury to create the 80/20 position\n(2) Migrate ALCX/ETH incentives to veAura Bribes - 50% once gauge is secured, the remaining 50% two weeks later\n\n### **Context**\n\nA recent announcement from the Alchemix team outlines the plans to revamp ALCX tokenomics by turning it into a revenue generating asset through its ability to influence gauges, earn from protocol revenue, and generate FLUX. For more details see [this post](https://alchemixfi.medium.com/vealcx-update-272e8900ac5a). \n\nAs a precursor to the functionality of veALCX, the DAO will need to transition its liquidity from the current Sushi 50/50 ALCX/ETH pool to a new Balancer 80/20 ALCX/ETH Pool. This will mark the first step on the path towards a revenue-generating ALCX. Much like how the Curve ecosystem emits CRV, Balancer emits BAL to liquidity providers of its pools. The amounts of the emissions are determined by gauge votes using locked BAL (veBAL), or locked Aura (vlAURA). After creating this 80/20 Balancer pool we will be able to apply for a Balancer gauge, and all indications seem to suggest that we should have no problem passing a request for this. To this end, this proposal is being put forward, and centers around two main ideas:\n\n(1) Approval to create the 80/20 Balancer Pool, and to migrate both our current ALCX protocol-owned liquidity, and the incentives on that pool.\n(2) Approval to execute a strategic acquisition of AURA for our future gauge.\n\n### **Part 1 - Migration of ALCX Liquidity and Incentives to Balancer**\n\nGiven the fact that the DAO code is ready for audit, and that the specs have been finalized (barring anything unforeseen in audits), the Biz-Gov subDAO believe now is a good time to begin this transition. The goal at first should be to successfully incentivize as much liquidity as possible in our existing pool to migrate to the new Balancer pool. In order to do so we should migrate all of the current incentives on our Sushi pool to the Balancer pool. This should be done at a gradual predictable rate so that liquidity providers in the current ALCX/ETH pool have ample time to become informed, and to migrate their funds. Currently liquidity providers in the Sushi pool are earning 20% of weekly ALCX emissions. The quantity of total emissions, as well as the weight of emissions that incentivize each pool in our ecosystem, can be found [here.](https://alchemix-stats.com/) \n\nThe Biz-Gov subDAO advocates a complete migration of 100% of POL, (protocol-owned liquidity) in the form of ALCX/ETH ($1.07m) currently residing in Sushiswap, to the future Balancer pool, at the discretion of the Biz-Gov subDAO once the pool has been created. The Biz-Gov subDAO also advocates migrating all current ALCX incentives to the Balancer pool, either in the form of direct incentives, or as bribes to take advantage of the current bribe multiplier that exists on Aura. This Biz-Gov subDAO advocates a gradual transition of these incentives over the course of 2 weeks; migrating 50% after the gauge is secured, and the rest 2 weeks later.\n\n### **Voting**\nVoting is single-choice.\n\n1. Yes - Migrate POL and incentives\n2. No - Discuss further\n3. Abstain",

      "title": "[AIP-78] Deploy funds in Blueberry",
      "content": "### Summary\nBlueberry is a new multi-step aggregator that enables lenders to earn passive income while borrowers are able to take advantage of on-chain leverage into their preferred yield strategy. Blueberry would like to partner with Alchemix and create custom strategy vaults for Alchemix related pools. Blueberry asks its partners to seed a lending deposit of their own tokens, and in exchange will integrate strategies in the ecosystem for leveraged deployments.\n\nIf the proposal succeeds, the Alchemix community will be able to earn low risk passive income by lending, or take more risk to earn high yields with leverage.\n\nChainlink is a seed investor in Blueberry and the protocol has been audited by multiple auditing firms including Hacken and Sherlock.\n### Proposal\nWe propose that the Alchemix DAO makes a treasury deposit of $500k worth of ALCX on Blueberry Lend [https://app.blueberry.garden/lend](https://app.blueberry.garden/lend) (URL not yet live, test deployment in progress).\n\nBlueberry will allow borrowers to borrow the tokens to enter custom automatic yield strategies, and will also support leverage into various pools for the assets.\n\nThis creates a new revenue stream for the treasury or other holders who do not wish to take any additional price risk by providing liquidity or locking their tokens. The treasury providing this liquidity will allow for the community to add leverage to their deployments.\n\nSetting up a blueberry lending market adds a source of passive yield for ecosystem token lenders that pays far higher market rates than they would receive on AAVE or Compound (projected Blueberry rate = 5-10%). All yield comes from borrower interest + bBLB emissions, net adding a significant amount of yield to the Alchemix ecosystem.\n\nIf the DAO decides to make a treasury deposit, Blueberry DAO will direct boosted bBLB emissions to the pool to create an additional yield. Estimated to be worth $20k over 2 months, which translates to a 24% APR on a deposit of $500k. After 2 months, the additional bBLB rewards are targeted to add a 3-5% bonus APR.\n\nIf this proposal passes, Blueberry is willing to enable the alAsset Curve pools (alUSD3Crv, alUSDFraxBP, alETHCrv) as possible strategies for borrowed assets, USDC, Dai and ETH. This incentivizes additional deposits into the main alAsset pools at no cost to Alchemix.\n\nBlueberry also makes it possible to insure the ALCX deposits at a very low annualized interest rate of 2% through Sherlock. Given that Blueberry (while thoroughly audited) is a new protocol, purchasing this insurance would be highly advised and is the default option should the proposal pass.\n\n### ALCX lending/borrowing\nThe ALCX deposited by the treasury would be borrowed by users and deployed in spells (strategies) operated by Blueberry, such as a 85/15 ALCX/USDC Univ3 pool.\n\nThe Blueberry ALCX market is specifically targeted at the Alchemix treasury, as the yield on the supplied ALCX will almost certainly be lower than gALCX staking, so possibly no other participants would choose to deposit. (This may change after veALCX launches and gALCX is sunset, as at that point the only option to earn native yield on ALCX would be through liquidity pools and locking the tokens)\nThis enables the Alchemix treasury to earn on its dormant ALCX without directly impacting the price of ALCX (the spells would require users to supply an equal amount of USDC/etc. to the amount of ALCX that they borrowed, thus the ALCX is not sold in the process). With the recent withdrawal from Tokemak, none of the treasury ALCX is currently deployed anywhere. The initial proposed deposit of $500k worth of ALCX is ~5% of the current treasury ALCX holdings.\n\n### Voting Options\nVoting is single-choice.\n\nThe “Approve” option greenlights the deployment of $500k treasury owned ALCX to be deployed in Blueberry and to insure the deployed assets.\nThe “Disapprove” option signals disapproval of deploying any assets into Blueberry.\n\n1.

      "content": "### Proposal:\nPre-authorize a grant from the DAO to support development costs of Alchemix Leveraged Vaults retroactively upon completion of outlined work.\n\n### Introduction:\n\nAlchemix Leveraged Vaults are a system like Yearn vaults that implement a leveraged yield strategy using Alchemix as the source of yield. See short whitepaper outlining technical summary and scope of deliverables [here](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Logris-Vaults-Alchemix-Leveraged-Vaults.pdf). \n\n### Context:\n\nI approached the Alchemix devs last year about this idea but it never got past the ideation phase because we were going to try to use the new grant system and it never materialized. This year I'm taking time off work, heading to EthDenver to form a team, and hoping to make this a reality as a BUIDLathon project. I've posted to numerous channels about this project so far but interest has been light. Overkoalafied suggested I write an AIP to pre-authorize grant money from the DAO payable only once this project is completed. This will help me attract developers (up to 3).\n\n### Alchemix Grant\n**Benefits for Alchemix**\n\nHaving simple access to a double yield option on deposits will help to attract users to the Alchemix platform. The implementation specifics also open the door to a soft queue by which users can enlist in vaults when they are full in lieu of a gas race when the ceiling are raised and for Alchemix to have tighter control over liquidity at the moment large volumes of alAssets are minted and sold. This provides a better experience to users and helps the AMO to function efficiently.\n\n**Usage of Grant**\n\nThe primary use of the grant is to attract a development team at EthDenver. Failing that I have had offers from members of previous projects I worked on who won't be able to attend EthDenver but would be willing to help make this before EOY.\n\n**Delivery of Grant (in case the proposal passes)**\n\nGrant money will be retroactively granted upon completion and handoff of the deliverables to the Alchemix DAO.\n\n**Size of Grant**\n\nThis proposal is for $10k in whatever denomination of stablecoin the Alchemix multi-sig approves of.  If you disapprove of this amount please add to the discussion\n\n**Summary**\n\nLet's [BUIDL](https://www.ethdenver.com/buidlweek). Reach out to me on Discord LogrisTheBard#0557 or reddit /u/logristhebard if you'd be interested in joining this team whether or not this grant proposal passes. I'm personally doing this as labor of love but I understand how in demand experienced Solidity devs are and will be a bit heartbroken if I can't get a team together to make this.\n\n**Summary**\nA vote \"FOR\" indicates desire to retroactively fund Alchemix Leveraged Vaults with $10k, paid in stables, upon completion of technical deliverables outlined in the proposal\n\"AGAINST\", \"ABSTAIN\" are self explanatory.\n\n",

This vault strategy will be reviewed by the core team and/or audited by Sherlock.\n\nAlchemix will partner with Revest to offer 1 months of optional upfront yield for users to lock their LP for 1 months. The program will run for 6 months. The up-front yield will be 0.667% (8% APR)], paid in ETH, funded by the Alchemix treasury selling assets deemed fit. The total offering will be 100 ETH or 16.67 ETH/month*\n\n### Voting Options\nFor - new strategy, revest option\nAgainst - no strat or revest\nAbstain",

The working title for the name of the token is MANA. Given that MANA is a widely used token name, we would like something different. We put a call out for suggestions, and we received 25 ideas for token names. We thought that 25 names were too many for a vote. BizGov had an internal vote, and we narrowed the list down to our top 8 favorite candidates. You can find explanations on why certain names would be fitting for Alchemix in the forum post above.\n### Proposal\nOf the top 8 candidates as chosen by the BizGov subDAO and Alchemix core, the Alchemix community now has the opportunity to vote on what the name of this new token should be. Please rank them in order from your favorite to least favorite.\n### Voting\nVoting is ranked choice. Options are:\n\n- MATERIA\n- SHARD\n- FLUX\n- SPARK\n- CHEM\n- FAVOR\n- ESTER\n- BRASS",

      "title": "[AIP-76] alOHM: new alAsset & launch proposal",
      "content": "### Summary\n- Launch alOHM as a new alAsset\n- Deploy an alOHM Alchemist on Mainnet with an OHM staking strategy\n- Create an alOHM/OHM Balancer pool and apply for a gauge\n- Allocate up to 500 ALCX a week to support liquidity in this pool\n- Deploy an alOHM Elixir AMO\n\nThe alOHM Alchemist will have the following parameters at launch:\n- Accepted collateral: OHM, gOHM\n- Max LTV: 50%\n- Vault fee: 15%\n- Deposit cap: 1,000,000 OHM\n- Repayment and liquidation caps: no caps, set at infinite\n- Maximum loss: 5 bps (0.05%)\n- Transmuter: set flow rate at 0.00237 OHM/second and a max transmuterBuffer of 75,000 OHM\n### Context\nAlchemix’s focus over the last months has been to expand cross-chain and to deploy new yield strategies for existing alAssets. In parallel, we’ve been exploring the creation of new - more exotic - alAssets with interested protocols. The feasibility of creating a new alAsset depends on various factors, but some of the more important ones relate to a sustainable yield source, user demand, willingness of the partner protocol to support the product, and a clear path towards profitability.\n\nAfter discussions with a few different protocols and considering various new alAssets, we propose to launch alOHM as the first “exotic” alAsset. We will outline various reasons in this proposal for doing so, but in short, alOHM has a sustainable yield source, Olympus is willing to support the bootstrapping of the product, and alOHM has historically been requested by both communities.\n\nIn this proposal we will outline the suggested launch parameters, vault strategies, liquidity support and an Elixir launch.\n\n(As a side note, a question that is likely to come up is ‘why not alBTC first?’. The short answer to that is that the lack of a proper, up-only yield source and/or partner protocol support makes the product unfeasible. Without a good yield source and/or third party support the product will not be profitable for the protocol and will present a constant drain on the treasury and the limited emissions available.)\n\n### alOHM Alchemist and launch parameters\n#### Collateral types\nAccepted collateral types for the alOHM Alchemist are: OHM, gOHM (wrapper for staked OHM).\n\n#### LTV%\nMaintain the same LTV% for alOHM as for alUSD and alETH and set it at 50%.\n\n#### Yield strategy\nLaunch alOHM with a single initial yield strategy. This strategy uses the OHM staking rate (currently 7.5% APY).\n\n#### Vault fee\nSet the vault fee % for alOHM at 15%.\n\n#### Deposit cap & Cap raises\nWe propose to set the initial deposit cap at 1,000,000 OHM (roughly $10m USD). For the launch it might be prudent to start off with 100,000 OHM to ensure the product functions as intended. At the core team’s discretion this can be ramped up to a maximum deposit cap of 1,000,000 OHM.\n\n#### Maximum loss\nThis is a variable that disables certain actions such as the ability to deposit in the vault in the event that the yield source is losing money. This should ideally never come into play but serves as a safeguard in the event of a problem with an integrated yield source. While this is unlikely to happen for alOHM we propose to set this variable at 5 bps (0.05%).\n\n#### Repayment & liquidation caps\nCurrently, repayment and liquidation caps are only set for alUSD. The repayment cap specifies the quantity of debt that can be repaid over a set duration of time, while the liquidation cap specifies the quantity of an asset that can be liquidated over a set duration of time. Since OHM is a free floating asset - similar to ETH - and not stably pegged to another asset (e.g. USD) we propose to leave the cap at infinite.\n\n#### Transmuter\nIn order to support the alOHM peg and facilitate arbitrage, the transmuter flow will be enabled at the start. Note that any funds directed to the transmuter will not enter the Elixir AMO. This proposal suggests setting the initial flow rate to 0.00237 OHM/second with a maximum transmuterBuffer of 75,000 OHM. Anything beyond that will be directed into the Elixir. Depending on the alOHM peg in the period following the launch, a separate proposal might have to be put up to change this flow rate up or down.\n\n### Liquidity\nThe second key thing to outline in this launch proposal is how the liquidity will function. The majority of the costs of creating a new alAsset is the incentivization of a new pool, and so having a path towards sustainable liquidity management through third party support and an Elixir AMO is crucial.\n\n#### Liquidity home\nAfter consultation with the Olympus team we propose to create an alOHM/OHM stableswap pool on Balancer. There are a few reasons for this choice. First, the majority of OHM liquidity in the market today can be found on Balancer. This means that this new alOHM pool easily routes into the existing OHM/DAI and OHM/ETH pools, as well as other, smaller OHM pools there. Second, at the time of writing, the cost of incentivization on Balancer/Aura vs. Curve/Convex is lower - more specifically, the bribe multiplier is higher. Over time we expect this gap to equalize but for now it does make it more attractive to launch a pool on Balancer. Finally, it also gives the treasury a chance to start building a BAL/AURA position as well, which will be useful not just for the incentivization of the alOHM/OHM pool but also for the future release of [veALCX](https://alchemixfi.medium.com/vealcx-update-272e8900ac5a).\n\nAfter deploying the pool we will request a Balancer gauge so that we can use bribes to incentivize liquidity.\n\n#### Liquidity incentives\nAllocate up to 500 ALCX in weekly emissions to support liquidity in the pool. At the time of writing, the bribe multiplier for Aura is fluctuating between roughly 1:1.5 and 1:1.75 - meaning that every ALCX spend on incentives will have a multiplicative effect on the actual dollar incentives for the pool.\n\nNote that these liquidity incentives are up to 500 ALCX of weekly emissions. Olympus intends to support the initial bootstrapping of the pool (pending governance vote), and so those funds can be used as well to supplement the weekly emissions.\n\nDepending on pool APR% and TVL the ALCX spend can be lowered, or increased, up to the cap to make sure the liquidity is sufficient for the product to function.\n\n#### Olympus support\nAs part of the launch of alOHM we have agreed with Olympus on support for the liquidity costs. There are two parts of this support: 1) Olympus will deposit 150k OHM in protocol-owned OHM into the pool which acts as a piece of guaranteed, sustainable liquidity for the protocol. 2) Olympus will help co-incentivize the incentivization of the pool for the initial bootstrapping period. More specifically, they have agreed to provide $50k per quarter in support for a total of two quarters.\n\nThe proposal for Olympus has been created [here](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1742-oip-126-self-repaying-ohm-alchemix-alohm-launch-support) and already got approved on [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/olympusdao.eth/proposal/0x058bda9a27ba8e0e154df38fdd6f41e59c640a44cd6252cacad965549d0994d7).\n\n#### Elixir AMO\nAs a final part of the liquidity set-up, this proposal would also authorize the creation of an Elixir for alOHM for Balancer and Aura. That is, the Elixir will take idle OHM in reserve and add it to the alOHM/OHM pool and stake the LP tokens on Aura in order to receive a share of the BAL and Aura rewards. The Elixir plays an important part in the overall path towards profitability of the product and the sooner we launch one, the faster it starts to accumulate funds that provide income to the protocol. For more information on how the Elixir AMO functions, see [here](https://alchemix-finance.gitbook.io/user-docs/guides-and-explainers/the-amo-the-elixir).\n\nThis alOHM Elixir will be the first one for the Balancer ecosystem for the protocol. Assuming the gauge proposal for an alOHM/OHM pool passes, it means that - over time - this Elixir will start to earn BAL and AURA rewards. We suggest that during the initial bootstrapping period of 6 months the accumulated rewards are locked up in respective veBAL and vlAURA positions. This increases the governance power of the protocol and means that we will be able to vote for our own pools. At launch that will be the alOHM/OHM pool, but over time this voting power could also be used for veALCX (i.e. the ALCX/ETH 80/20 pool).\n\nPlease note that locking BAL as veBAL requires whitelisting on Balancer. The above is assuming Alchemix can be whitelisted to lock these rewards on Balancer. If not, the alternative would be to sell BAL for AURA to gain voting power, or to lock them on other third party platforms like StakeDAO.\n\nAfter the bootstrapping period a governance vote can be created to utilize these rewards harvests differently. For example, by making them part of the [Elixir harvests framework](https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/342-aip-57-temporary-elixir-harvest-framework).\n\n### Voting\nA vote “FOR” authorizes Alchemix to launch alOHM as a new alAsset, to deploy an alOHM Alchemist and yield strategy, to create an alOHM/OHM pool on Balancer, to allocate part of the weekly emissions to this pool, and to deploy an alOHM Elixir.\n\nA vote “AGAINST” does not authorize Alchemix to launch alOHM with the above parameters.",

      "content": "This proposal is to decide on the allocation of the Alchemix Optimism grant for liquidity incentives in Velodrome.\n### Context\nThe Optimism Collective runs an ongoing grant program for protocols deployed on the Optimism network, to incentivize usage. Protocols can apply for grants based on what value they provide to the network.\n\nAlchemix applied for such a grant and was awarded 250k OP tokens (worth $250k at the time of writing). Read the application and discussions here: [https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-cycle-7-proposal-alchemix/3475](https://gov.optimism.io/t/review-gf-phase-1-cycle-7-proposal-alchemix/3475)\n\nThe OP tokens are to be spent over the course of 6 months split in the following way:\n- _50% (125,000)_ will incentivize vault depositors in the form of boosted yield, for 6 months, split between alETH and alUSD.\n- _50% (125,000)_ will incentivize Liquidity Providers on Velodrome through bribes, for 6 months, split between alETH and alUSD. Estimated $2.5m additional liquidity at 10% APR\n\nThis is split into 2 proposals, [AIP-74-A] and [AIP-74-B], with this proposal written for the allocation of the liquidity incentives.\n### Liquidity Incentives\nThere are currently two alAsset pools in Velodrome: alUSD-USDC and alETH-WETH.\n\nWe also have an option to create a paired pool with QiDao’s MAI stablecoin in the form of an alUSD-MAI pool.\nQiDao is a multi-chain lending protocol, where users can deposit different assets as collateral and take out 0% interest loans in the form of the protocol’s stablecoin, MAI.\nThe protocol’s smart contracts have been audited by two entities, for more information refer to their docs: [https://docs.mai.finance/risks/security](https://docs.mai.finance/risks/security)\nMAI’s price stability is ensured through debt repayments. If MAI’s price decreases, users are incentivized to buy MAI and pay back their loans, essentially making a profit.\nYou can learn more about QiDao in the docs linked above or on their website: [https://mai.finance](https://mai.finance)\n\nContext for decision making:\n\n- Alchemix vault TVLs on Optimism have roughly been balanced between ETH and stable vaults since deployment, with the ETH vault currently being twice the size of the stable vaults, standing at $0.33M and $0.16M, respectively.\nThough please note that these are very low amounts compared to overall Alchemix deposits, so they may or may not be representative of the true demand, should the boosts already be active.\n- Current liquidity for the alETH-WETH pool: $1.3M\n- Current liquidity for the alUSD-USDC pool: $0.6M\n- Given that QiDao would also provide their own incentives for the proposed joint pool (matching our own bribes), assuming a similar required APR for the pool as the existing alUSD pool, we would get twice as much alUSD liquidity for the same price. MAI currently has $11M of liquidity on velodrome, much larger than our own would be. MAI is also paired with other assets, so through this pool we would probably be able to capture some additional volume. Deployment of this pool would also depend on a final approval by QiDao.\nIt is worth noting that liquidity pool pairings do not pose a threat to protocol health, as long as there are no protocol controlled funds in the pool. Even if the paired asset in question collapses, all of the alAssets can leave the pool, with liquidity providers taking the hit. However, this is a known risk for any LP when deciding to enter any pool.\n\n### Voting\nVoting is ranked choice, the option that receives the most votes will be implemented.\nIf QiDao governance decides against the alUSD-MAI pool, then all votes allocated to the alUSD-MAI pool will go to the alUSD-USDC pool instead.\n\nalETH refers to the alETH-WETH pool, alUSD refers to the alUSD-USDC pool and MAI refers to the alUSD-MAI pool.\nVoting options:\n\n1. 66% alETH, 17% alUSD, 17% MAI \n2. 66% alETH, 34% alUSD\n3. 50% alETH, 25% alUSD, 25% MAI\n4. 50% alETH, 50% alUSD\n5. 33% alETH, 33% alUSD, 33% MAI\n6. 33% alETH, 66% alUSD\n7.

So naturally, yields are expected to be higher on Yearn, compared to Aave (even though Yearn currently only deploys assets in Aave themselves).\nIt also needs to be noted that through Yearn’s partner program, Alchemix collects more fees from Yearn vaults than other strategies.\n\nAs the vault migrator tool is getting deployed on Optimism as well, existing depositors will be able to move their funds from the Aave strategies to the Yearn strategies.\nFor these reasons, this proposal assumes that all of the incentives should go to Yearn vaults.\nTo signal disapproval, there is a corresponding voting option.\n\nFor Alchemix, generally, having a larger amount of funds in a lower number of vaults is preferable, as more frequent harvests can be run, compared to when funds are scattered amongst many vaults. Though in a low gas fee environment, like Optimism, this effect is not as impactful.\n\nThe boosts would be able to incentivize the following amount of deposits, given an expected boosted yield:\n- $25M for a 1% boost\n- $12M for a 2% boost\n- $5M for a 5% boost\n- etc.\n\n### Voting\nVoting is ranked choice. Options are:\n\n- 50% to yvDAI, 50% to yvUSDC\n- 33% to yvWETH, 33% to yvDAI, 33% to yvUSDC\n- 50% to yvWETH, 25% to yvDAI, 25% to yvUSDC\n- 66% to yvWETH, 33% to yvDAI\n- 66% to yvWETH, 33% to yvUSDC\n- 66% to yvWETH, 17% to yvDAI, 17% to yvUSDC\n- 100% to yvWETH\n- Aave should be included - new vote needed",

      "title": "[AIP-75] [RFC::Ecosystem-Grant] Fair Funding Platform by Unstoppable",
      "content": "Note: This proposal is a revote of AIP-73U, due to not meeting the recently incorporated quorum in the last vote. \n\n## Proposal:\nGive a grant to support the audit cost of the Fair Funding platform built on Alchemix by Unstoppable.\n\n## Introduction:\nWe at Unstoppable are an early stage DeFi project (pre-funding, pre-revenue) and have come up with a way for projects like us to be fairly funded with the help of Alchemix.\n\nWhile we are experienced devs and have a strong internal security process, we definitely want to get an external audit by a reputable and competent audit team to ensure the safety of user funds and the Alchemix ecosystem.\nGiven our early stage and the price tag of a good audit these days, this grant would help us achieve a level of certified security that we simply couldn’t afford otherwise.\n\n## Context:\n\n### Unstoppable:\nOur vision at Unstoppable is to build the best risk:reward DeFi products in the space and make them accessible to everyone.  \nAnd to give back.   \n(Learn more about our vision [here](https://unstoppabledefi.medium.com/protecting-your-investments-while-generating-outsized-returns-2a326bcba6ac))\n\nWe didn’t want to sell a token before we’ve released products, proven PMF and are making real revenue. We also didn’t want to sell out to the VCs.  \nSo out of necessity we came up with a new way for funding early stage crypto projects like us.\n\n\n\n### Fair Funding In Crypto: \nA project being sustainably funded, with substantial benefits for the early supporters and _no risk of them losing their money_ - built on Alchemix and a Nounsdao concept. \n- One daily auction for a “Fair Funding Spot” \n- The spot carries a significant benefit in the project such as a discount or bonus in the future tokensale, reduced fees or boosted yields \n- All proceeds from the auction are put into an Alchemix vault. A non-liquidatable, self-repaying loan is then taken out which will be the actual funding going to the project. \n- The funder/investor retains complete ownership of the original funds and gets back 100% over time! Either paid back early by the projects success, or in a worst case scenario by the self-repaying loan on Alchemix over time. \n\nThis significantly reduces the risk profile of contributing funds to an early stage project, yet allows the project to raise in a sustainable way - a fair win/win for all parties. \n\nRead more about it [here](https://unstoppabledefi.medium.com/fair-funding-in-crypto-bc88d633646).\n\n\n### Current Status:\nThe contracts are already about 75% complete. They've been developed fully test-driven with 100% test coverage in Vyper. The core functionality is already in place, what's still missing is advanced features like migrating between Alchemix vaults to capture the best yields and an opt-out possibility to self-liquidate since we want offer our users the maximum amount of freedom and don't have them locked in (debt positions are fully tokenized and tradeable as well).  \nWhen complete they will go through our strict internal security process [which we've outlined here](https://unstoppabledefi.medium.com/security-at-unstoppable-finance-bcaad26c628b).\n\nAfter that we would want them to be audited by a reputable and competent external auditing team.\n\n### Unstoppable:Team\n![Our Core Team](https://unstoppable.ooo/unstoppable_team.png)\n\n\n## Alchemix Grant\n**Benefits for Alchemix**\n\nThe Fair Funding platform built on Alchemix highlights the new composability of the Alchemix v2 platform with a project that contributes real value to builders and communities in the space.\n\nIt will bring volume and new users to the Alchemix platform and showcase the possibilities of building on and with Alchemix.\n\n\n**Usage of Grant**\n\nThe primary use of the grant would be to pay for an official audit of the Fair Funding contracts by one of the reputable and competent audit companies. We are already in contact with ChainSecurity who would be our ideal choice and are waiting for a quote. In case ChainSecurity is too expensive, we've already established a relationship with Sherlock.xyz who could be a viable alternative.\n\nAny excess funds would be used to support further development of the platform (such as UI) and to spread awareness of the new Fair Funding possibility powered by Alchemix.\n\n\n**Delivery of Grant (in case the proposal passes)**\n\nWe are happy to complete the work on the contracts _before_ the grant would be payed out to eliminate execution risk.  \nWe are also happy to have the Alchemix team escrow the grant funds (or be part of a multisig) to ensure the funds are only used as outlined above.  \n\n**Size of Grant**\n\nThe scope of the audit would need to cover the three main contracts (Auction, Vault, tokenized position). It should be <1000 lines of code which according to [Sherlocks pricing](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/protocols/audit-pricing-and-timeline) would put it somewhere towards the mid-to-high end of the $15-$38k range. (Vyper pricing is slightly different according to Sherlock).  \nWe are still waiting on an estimate from ChainSecurity but given that they have a longer track record and have established themselves as one of the best auditing teams out there, we expect their quote to be higher.\n\nAnd as we said above, any funds beyond the pure audit cost would be put to good use to make more teams know about and use the Fair Funding platform.\n\nWe hope the Alchemix community can help us suggest what a fair amount for this grant would be.\n\n### Summary\nBy supporting this grant request, you would help a young project that's determined to add value to the space and establish itself as a good player and you would help expand and ensure the safety of the Alchemix ecosystem.\n\n## Voting Options \nA vote \"FOR\" authorizes sending this proposal to the official Alchemix snapshot in its current form, against doesn't not authorize sending to the official snapshot:\n\n### Voting options (ranked choice)\n1. For: Audit only (Sherlock) ~1.5-2k ALCX (exact amount determined by Sherlock)\n2. For: Do it properly - ChainSecurity Audit or Sherlock + dev support ~2.5k-7k (exact amount to be discussed in comments)\n3. Against: We shouldn't fund this at all\n4. Abstain: I have a better idea (see comments)\n",

      "content": "This is a proposal following up the passing of “[RFC] A deeper collaboration with Frax Finance”. Specifics about the size of the alUSDFRAXBP AMO were left out of the poll. This proposal presents five different choices for Alchemix DAO governance to decide.\n\nSee the linked forum discussion for the full rationale and discussion.\n\nChoice 1: No alUSDFRAXBP AMO\n\nChoice 2: Continue current AMO setup, but allocate the 11.6M DAI reserve to alUSDFRAXBP\n\nThis is certainly the most conservative choice in a sense. The DAI in reserve would be converted to alUSDFRAXBP tokens, which would make the AMO the largest LP in the pool. It would deepen the markets and increase the amount of support from FRAX, but it still would be about 1/5 the size of the alUSD3CRV AMO, and a larger more liquid complement to the main pool. The Votium budget would be split 80% to alUSD3CRV and 20% to alUSDFRAXBP\n\nChoice 3: Split the AMO’s 50/50 in size.\n\nThis is the clear middle ground choice. Each liquidity pool has its own advantages and disadvantages, based on the stable coins you prefer between them. The 11.5M DAI reserve will also be split evenly between both AMOs. This would be respectful of the users who prefer interacting or LPing with DAI and USDT vs FRAX while also increasing the earnings ratio of the AMOs. The current Votium budget would be split between the two pools evenly.\n\nChoice 4: Make alUSDFRAXBP the primary AMO.\n\nThis is the Fraximalist choice. 80% of both the 46.9M alUSD3CRV and 11.5M DAI will be allocated to the alUSDFRAXBP AMO, along with 80% of the Votium incentive budget. This choice would still leave a sizable 11.6M alUSD3CRV AMO and adequate support from incentives for liquid markets. The resulting alUSDFRAXBP AMO would control 46.72M of the pool’s liquidity, likely resulting in making alUSD liquidity incentivisation a net gain for the DAO.\n\nChoice 5: Fraxchemical alUSD\n\nSame as Choice 3, but 100% in alUSDFRAXBP and allowing the alUSD3CRV pool to be deprecated. This would be the most aggressive option of the three, resulting in the largest AMO gains. However, if users want to swap to DAI or USDT, they will face higher fees as the trade will need to be routed via USDC or FRAX. Another potential drawback is that any and all potential risk with FRAX will be passed along to alUSD without alternative markets to diversify with.\n\n",

      "title": "[AIP-72-B] Addition of FRAX as alUSD collateral",
      "content": "One part of the recent RFC with Frax Finance was the addition of their stablecoin, FRAX as a new collateral asset for alUSD. The RFC document was to gauge sentiment about both the addition of an alUSDFRAXBP AMO and FRAX as alUSD collateral. Therefore, the passing two separate proposals for each the AMO and collateral are required to enact them both.\n\nFrax is currently the second largest decentralized stablecoin by market cap. When FRAX first launched, the only way to generate FRAX was via a dual deposit of both their governance token, FXS, and USDC, with the ratio generally being 80% USDC and 20% FXS. In this setup, FRAX is a semi-algorithmic stablecoin with a portion of its backing being in the form of its native governance token. Frax had mild success with this formula, generating over 100m FRAX via this method, however their protocol found a safe avenue for hyper-scaling via the introduction of the AMO (from which the Alchemix AMO was modeled).\n\nWhile Frax has several AMOs deployed, their main one historically has been the FRAX3CRV AMO. This mechanism works by setting a minimum accepted price for the FRAX stablecoin. Currently, they target a peg of 1 FRAX per USDC. If FRAX is at or above this peg, then the protocol can directly mint FRAX into the liquidity pool, and conversely, if it is under the peg, Frax can withdraw and burn FRAX from the AMO to restore its peg. Then this Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) is put to work earning yield in Convex, with the farmed assets going to bolster the FXS price and increasing their voting influence on Curve gauges. This strategy then created a flywheel effect, where their liquidity incentives became ever more profitable for the protocol while also increasing their market share, making FRAX the second largest decentralized stablecoin.\n\nWhile some people may understandably have some hesitation around a semi-algorithmic stablecoin, especially after what had happened to Luna and other algo-stables, since the Frax protocol owns the vast majority of the FRAX in circulation, they are able to gracefully expand and contract with the market. While every other decentralized stablecoin saw a somewhat elongated period of depegging following the psychological damage done to LPs after the Luna meltdown, FRAX’s peg was stable because their AMOs properly contracted by removing and burning the right amount of FRAX.\n\nBecause of this, the risk assessors in the Alchemix core team felt confident enough in FRAX to present this proposal to the DAO. Some risks do exist for it much like all other stablecoin assets in the ecosystem, but none any more severe than any of the other accepted collaterals.\n\nWith the rollout of the Vesper and AAVE adapters, there are currently two different strategies we can readily plug into for FRAX.\n\nThe Alchemists on mainnet will be updated to include the following initial parameters for FRAX:\nAccepted Collateral\nFRAX, aFRAX, vaFRAX\n\nMax LTV\n= 50%\n\nInitial Deposit Caps\naFRAX = $100k\nvaFRAX = $100k\n\nRepayment and Liquidation Caps\nFRAX = $100k per 60 minutes\n\nMaximum Loss\naFRAX = 5 bps (0.05%)\nvaFRAX = 5 bps (0.05%)\n\nIn addition, we will deploy a FRAX transmuter that will follow the standard parameters of the other alUSD transmuters.\n\nAfter the initial launch with the above parameters has proven to be stable and safe, Alchemix DAO will increase the capacity of FRAX strategies based on how the DAO votes on the following choices:\n\nChoice 1: Conservative\n\nInitial Deposit Caps\naFRAX = $1m\nvaFRAX = $1m\n\nRepayment and Liquidation Caps\nFRAX = $500k per 60 minutes\n\nChoice 2: Moderate\n\nInitial Deposit Caps\naFRAX = $3m\nvaFRAX = $3m\n\nRepayment and Liquidation Caps\nFRAX = $1m per 60 minutes\n\nChoice 3: Aggressive\n\nInitial Deposit Caps\naFRAX = $5m\nvaFRAX = $5m\n\nRepayment and Liquidation Caps\nFRAX = $1m per 60 minutes",

      "title": "[AIP-73] [RFC::Ecosystem-Grant] Fair Funding Platform by Unstoppable",
      "content": "## Proposal:\nGive a grant to support the audit cost of the Fair Funding platform built on Alchemix by Unstoppable.\n\n## Introduction:\nWe at Unstoppable are an early stage DeFi project (pre-funding, pre-revenue) and have come up with a way for projects like us to be fairly funded with the help of Alchemix.\n\nWhile we are experienced devs and have a strong internal security process, we definitely want to get an external audit by a reputable and competent audit team to ensure the safety of user funds and the Alchemix ecosystem.\nGiven our early stage and the price tag of a good audit these days, this grant would help us achieve a level of certified security that we simply couldn’t afford otherwise.\n\n## Context:\n\n### Unstoppable:\nOur vision at Unstoppable is to build the best risk:reward DeFi products in the space and make them accessible to everyone.  \nAnd to give back.   \n(Learn more about our vision [here](https://unstoppabledefi.medium.com/protecting-your-investments-while-generating-outsized-returns-2a326bcba6ac))\n\nWe didn’t want to sell a token before we’ve released products, proven PMF and are making real revenue. We also didn’t want to sell out to the VCs.  \nSo out of necessity we came up with a new way for funding early stage crypto projects like us.\n\n\n\n### Fair Funding In Crypto: \nA project being sustainably funded, with substantial benefits for the early supporters and _no risk of them losing their money_ - built on Alchemix and a Nounsdao concept. \n- One daily auction for a “Fair Funding Spot” \n- The spot carries a significant benefit in the project such as a discount or bonus in the future tokensale, reduced fees or boosted yields \n- All proceeds from the auction are put into an Alchemix vault. A non-liquidatable, self-repaying loan is then taken out which will be the actual funding going to the project. \n- The funder/investor retains complete ownership of the original funds and gets back 100% over time! Either paid back early by the projects success, or in a worst case scenario by the self-repaying loan on Alchemix over time. \n\nThis significantly reduces the risk profile of contributing funds to an early stage project, yet allows the project to raise in a sustainable way - a fair win/win for all parties. \n\nRead more about it [here](https://unstoppabledefi.medium.com/fair-funding-in-crypto-bc88d633646).\n\n\n### Current Status:\nThe contracts are already about 75% complete. They've been developed fully test-driven with 100% test coverage in Vyper. The core functionality is already in place, what's still missing is advanced features like migrating between Alchemix vaults to capture the best yields and an opt-out possibility to self-liquidate since we want offer our users the maximum amount of freedom and don't have them locked in (debt positions are fully tokenized and tradeable as well).  \nWhen complete they will go through our strict internal security process [which we've outlined here](https://unstoppabledefi.medium.com/security-at-unstoppable-finance-bcaad26c628b).\n\nAfter that we would want them to be audited by a reputable and competent external auditing team.\n\n### Unstoppable:Team\n![Our Core Team](https://unstoppable.ooo/unstoppable_team.png)\n\n\n## Alchemix Grant\n**Benefits for Alchemix**\n\nThe Fair Funding platform built on Alchemix highlights the new composability of the Alchemix v2 platform with a project that contributes real value to builders and communities in the space.\n\nIt will bring volume and new users to the Alchemix platform and showcase the possibilities of building on and with Alchemix.\n\n\n**Usage of Grant**\n\nThe primary use of the grant would be to pay for an official audit of the Fair Funding contracts by one of the reputable and competent audit companies. We are already in contact with ChainSecurity who would be our ideal choice and are waiting for a quote. In case ChainSecurity is too expensive, we've already established a relationship with Sherlock.xyz who could be a viable alternative.\n\nAny excess funds would be used to support further development of the platform (such as UI) and to spread awareness of the new Fair Funding possibility powered by Alchemix.\n\n\n**Delivery of Grant (in case the proposal passes)**\n\nWe are happy to complete the work on the contracts _before_ the grant would be payed out to eliminate execution risk.  \nWe are also happy to have the Alchemix team escrow the grant funds (or be part of a multisig) to ensure the funds are only used as outlined above.  \n\n**Size of Grant**\n\nThe scope of the audit would need to cover the three main contracts (Auction, Vault, tokenized position). It should be <1000 lines of code which according to [Sherlocks pricing](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/protocols/audit-pricing-and-timeline) would put it somewhere towards the mid-to-high end of the $15-$38k range. (Vyper pricing is slightly different according to Sherlock).  \nWe are still waiting on an estimate from ChainSecurity but given that they have a longer track record and have established themselves as one of the best auditing teams out there, we expect their quote to be higher.\n\nAnd as we said above, any funds beyond the pure audit cost would be put to good use to make more teams know about and use the Fair Funding platform.\n\nWe hope the Alchemix community can help us suggest what a fair amount for this grant would be.\n\n\n### Summary\nBy supporting this grant request, you would help a young project that's determined to add value to the space and establish itself as a good player and you would help expand and ensure the safety of the Alchemix ecosystem.\n\n## Voting Options \nA vote \"FOR\" authorizes sending this proposal to the official Alchemix snapshot in its current form, against doesn't not authorize sending to the official snapshot:\n\n### Voting options (ranked choice)\n1. For: Audit only (Sherlock) ~1.5-2k ALCX (exact amount determined by Sherlock)\n2. For: Do it properly - ChainSecurity Audit or Sherlock + dev support ~2.5k-7k (exact amount to be discussed in comments)\n3. Against: We shouldn't fund this at all\n4. Abstain: I have a better idea (see comments)\n",

      "content": "Proposal:\n\nWhile Alchemix DAO is interested in maximizing the economic efficiency of our incentives, we think it is too risky to switch all of our Votium incentives over to StakeDAO. Instead, we would like to see a data-driven approach to evaluate their new platform, and if the numbers come back better than Votium, we can begin a transition over from Votium to StakeDAO. The transition should not be sudden in our opinion regardless because of voter lag inherent to direct veCRV voter incentives.\n\nCurrently, we incentivise the alUSD3CRV and alETH crv LPs with 2000 ALCX/week each. We are proposing to keep this baseline number the same, but with 12.5% of the total going to StakeDAO for the duration of a 6 week trial. That would amount to a total of 1500 ALCX going to StakeDAO’s Curve incentives over these 6 weeks. Upon the 4th week of the trial, Alchemix DAO will provide data regarding their economic efficiency, and if they are indeed more economical, we will present a follow up proposal to transition our incentives over from Votium to StakeDAO.\n\nRead the full forum post for more details.",

      "content": "This proposal is to migrate all funds that have not been migrated by users from the temporary v1->v2 migration contract to v2.\n\nContext\nFollowing the launch of Alchemix v2, only a relatively small portion of depositors migrated their funds to the v2 contracts. For this reason, AIP-61 was put forth and approved by governance.\n\nYou can read the detailed proposal here:\nhttps://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/348-aip-61-migrate-v1-to-v2-and-sunset-v1\nAnd the snapshot vote here:\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/alchemixstakers.eth/proposal/0x400427697f3a0335a5cad821b9f6da29bc30b1b7fffb8dc64e3d202a42df55d5\n\nThe proposal outlined the v1 funds to be moved to a temporary migration contract that makes it possible for users to then migrate their position (deposit and outstanding debt) with a single low-cost transaction to v2.\n\nThe reason the funds were moved into this temporary contract and not directly to v2 contracts in the first place, was to provide the lowest cost, least “intrusive” option for v1 depositors to migrate their funds. They were comfortable using the v1 contracts, but no assumptions could be made for their willingness to use the v2 contracts.\nHowever, this came with the downside of the deposits sitting idle while in the migration contract.\n\nThis option has been available for a month now, but only a very small percentage of positions have been moved over by depositors. Funds in the temporary contract are not earning yield.\n\nThere are currently $12.87M DAI and 6,492 ETH in the temporary contract.\n\nUltimately the decision is to force the v1 users into v2 but allow their deposits to continue earning yield, or don't force them into new contracts but sacrifice their yield until they manually migrate.\n\nThis proposal calls for the protocol to complete the migration for these positions, as it is unclear when, if ever they would be moved by the users themselves.\n\nTechnical Details\nIf this AIP is approved, the dev multisig wallet will call the forceMigrate() function on each of the TransferAdapter contracts, for each of the addresses that have not yet migrated their funds.\nTransferAdapter_alUSD\nTransferAdapter_alETH\n\nVoting\nA vote “FOR” authorizes Alchemix to move all funds currently in the v1->v2 migration contract to v2.\nA vote “AGAINST” does not authorize Alchemix to move the funds from the v1->v2 migration contract.",

Consequently, Idle Leagues and Alchemix core team members had frequent chats to evaluate the impact of the loss on Wintermute capital and its borrower behavior.\n\nHere below you can find some evidence to help Alchemix community make the final decision in confirming this integration: \n\nWintermute [stated](https://twitter.com/wintermute_t/status/1572531790904168449) it is able to meet its repayment obligations, and the firm is financially healthy.\nIdle DAO [monitored](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1572629815546548225) the utilization rate of the Clearpool pool, which resulted in being stable after the incident. The Clearpool pool returned to normal operations, with [$20m in deposited assets](https://app.clearpool.finance/pool/0xCb288b6d30738db7E3998159d192615769794B5b?market=ethereum).\nCredora, the rating firm specialized in borrower rate and borrower capacity analysis,[ upgraded Wintermute to an “A” grade](https://twitter.com/CredoraPlatform/status/1573062061793460224) and increased borrowing capacity to $223m.\nLastly, Wintermute [fully repaid the $92m USDT loan](https://app.truefi.io/borrowers/0xA1614eC01d13E04522ED0b085C7a178ED9E99bc9) on TrueFi on October 15th.\n\n**Performances**\nRates on yvUSDC and aUSDC are respectively equal to 1.28% APY and 0.81% APY.\nUSDC Clearpool Senior PYT overperformed existing Alchemix integrations, with [3.73% APY](https://app.idle.finance/#/stats/tranches/clearpool/USDC) since October 1st.\n\nAs originally reported in AIP-63, deposits in Clearpool Senior PYT are fully fungible, there are no locking periods or epochs: liquidity providers can deposit and redeem liquidity anytime. The yield is accrued natively in USDC, as CPOOL incentives are automatically harvested.\n\n### Technical integration\nIn accordance with Alchemix team, Idle Leagues completed the development of the vault adapter, which can be used for Clearpool Senior PYT as well as for other future integrations.\nThe adapter passed Alchemix’s internal security review.\n\nDeployed and verified adapter address: [0x70728f08E97303D757be4Cd97A7D27B65Dd41E6D](https://etherscan.io/address/0x70728f08e97303d757be4cd97a7d27b65dd41e6d#code)\nDeployment repo PR: [Github](https://github.com/alchemix-finance/deployments/pull/5)\nTransaction details for the dev multisig:\n```\nYIELD_TOKEN_ADDRESS = `0xb86264c21418aA75F7c337B1821CcB4Ff4d57673`\nADAPTER_ADDRESS = `0x70728f08e97303d757be4cd97a7d27b65dd41e6d`\nMAX_LOSS = `5`\nMAXIMUM_EXPECTED_VALUE = `2000000000000`\nCREDIT_UNLOCK_BLOCKS = 7200\n\n0x5C6374a2ac4EBC38DeA0Fc1F8716e5Ea1AdD94dd.addYieldToken(0x5C6374a2ac4EBC38DeA0Fc1F8716e5Ea1AdD94dd, (0x70728f08e97303d757be4cd97a7d27b65dd41e6d, 5, 2000000000000, 7200));\n\n0x5C6374a2ac4EBC38DeA0Fc1F8716e5Ea1AdD94dd.setYieldTokenEnabled(0xb86264c21418aA75F7c337B1821CcB4Ff4d57673, true);\n```\n\nFor further information, check out [AIP-63](https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/355-aip-63-alchemix-x-idle-usdc-clearpool-senior-pyt-integration) and [its approved snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/alchemixstakers.eth/proposal/0x7c9f02af8ed243df281e87977a2b8a429dc67057f7a23ad68c95ec7f90f42a25). \n\n### Next steps\nThis proposal aims to confirm the integration of USDC Clearpool Senior PYT into Alchemix UI as a new valut. A new snapshot will be launched by the Alchemix team.\n\n—\nAbout Idle DAO: [Website](https://idle.finance/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/idlefinance) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/mpySAJp) | [Medium](https://medium.com/idle-finance) | [Documentation](https://docs.idle.finance/)\nAbout Clearpool: [Website](http://www.clearpool.finance/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ClearpoolFin) | [Telegram](https://t.me/clearpoolofficial) | [Medium](https://clearpool.medium.com/) | [Documentation](https://docs.clearpool.finance/clearpool/introduction/what-is-clearpool)\n",

      "title": "[AIP-66] Arrakis alUSD/alETH Univ3 Pool rewards",
      "content": "Over the last few weeks, Arrakis Finance has reached out to Alchemix DAO about the creation of Alchemix-related LP positions on Uniswap v3. Unlike Uniswap v2 and nearly every other on chain AMM, each LP position in Uniswap v3 is a unique NFT with a customizable and specific range of prices you are willing to LP at. This presents a challenge when trying to incentivise liquidity on Uniswap v3, and this is exactly where Arrakis Finance Uniswap v3 LP Tokens come in. Their protocol creates a fungible ERC-20 LP position that has a spread of liquidity that mimics the typical x * y = k formula but since it is range bound in a range of one quarter to four times the starting price, it provides a much greater concentration of liquidity than typical AMM curves, lowering slippage for traders.\n\nArrakis has kindly already created a UNIV3 LP for alUSD/alETH, token name “Arrakis Vault V1 alETH/alUSD (RAKIS-23)”. Anyone is free to deposit into it to test it out.\n\nUsers can interact with it on their browser via: https://beta.arrakis.finance/vaults/1/0xE0A34a39c694fFc1beCEcf5bd948e534931C1105\n\nIn collaboration with Arrakis, we are proposing a trial run in incentivising Arrakis Vault V1 alETH/alUSD Tokens via our native StakingPools contract. Currently, the vast majority of liquidity for alUSD is against stablecoins, and similarly alETH is mainly paired with ETH. By having a sufficiently deep alUSD/alETH pool, it will accomplish the following:\n\n-efficiently incentivise concentrated liquidity for alAsset pair.\n-create a direct path for Alchemix users to exchange their alAssets with one another.\n-create arbitrage opportunities that utilize our liquidity on other exchanges.\n-increase volume for alAsset pairs means increase real APY in trading fees for all alAsset LPs.\n\nFor example, if there is a large change in the price of ETH, then subsequently all pairs associated with ETH need to rebalance to the current accepted market price. This creates large arbitrage opportunities for traders that rebalance the pool, regardless the direction of the market. As traders take advantage of these price discrepancies, pairs tied to synthetic assets also need to rebalance. For example, if ETH pumps, someone would sell USDC for alUSD on Curve, buy the temporarily cheap alETH on Uni V3, then sell the alETH for ETH on Curve. Each step along the way in these hops generates trading fees for LPs, thus creating additional real APY in the form of accrued trading fees.\n\nWe are proposing an 8 week trial of the Arrakis alUSD/alETH vault being incentivised to provide 100 ALCX weekly. At the end of the 8 week period, we will need a subsequent vote to extend the incentives further. If the outcomes are favorable, it might warrant further exploration for how Arrakis and Alchemix can collaborate in the future as well as they are working on their V2 infrastructure and PALM product.\n\nSome potential risks with Arrakis Finance is that there is some (albeit minimal) human interaction needed with their contracts that is handled by the Arrakis team. This is to ensure that the current range is within their ideal parameterization. If there is a volatile event in crypto, the LP will need to adjust its range. This action is inherently safe, but it does require operators, and thus timeliness, reliability, and human error are all factors. That said, Arrakis has had a good track record and is a professional team. We are confident in their ability to run these contracts, and if we so choose, they can hand control of the vault to Alchemix DAO for us to operate.\n\nAs always, there exists contract risk. In addition to inheriting any risk associated with alUSD or alETH, LPs would also be exposed to risk in the Uniswap v3 protocol, Arrakis smart contracts, and the Alchemix StakingPools contract. But again, everything here has been audited and deployed for months/years, presenting minimal contract risk.",

      "title": "[AIP-65] ALCX/SDL token swap with Saddle DAO",
      "content": "Summary\nExchange 1,500,000$SDL for an equivalent dollar value of $ALCX.\n\nAbstract\nThis is a joint proposal between Alchemix DAO and Saddle DAO which seeks to strengthen the partnership between our two communities and protocols by way of a tokenswap and lock agreement between our protocols.\n\nMotivation\nSince the launch of our popular alETH pool, Saddle and Alchemix have collaborated to bring deep liquidity to the popular $alUSD, and $alETH tokens. A tokenswap would stand to tighten the bond between our protocols, and give Alchemix the power to vote in Saddles gauges, furthering the incentive for Alchemix users to continue supporting the liquidity of $alUSD and $alETH.\n\nIn addition to deepening the relationship between both protocols, this swap and lock would further diversify the nascent veSDL voting blocks; strengthening veSDL voting communally by renewing the ALCX incentives currently directed at the alETH pool to veSDL holder bribes– via Redacted Cartel’s Hidden Hand for a time.\n\nSpecification\nTransfer 1,500,000 SDL from multisig: 0x3F8E527aF4e0c6e763e8f368AC679c44C45626aE, to the Alchemix veSDL controller: 0x851abef4d67e8bb4ee2f90e5de5e880f6235d028.\n\nSaddle to lock all ALCX obtained in this agreement in the gALCX vault. Alchemix to lock all SDL obtained in this agreement for the max duration of 4 years.\n\nRedirect all ALCX incentives from Saddle's alETH pool, to veSDL holder bribes via Hidden Hand for a duration of 6 weeks, at the end of which another proposal will appear to reassess the distribution mechanism.",

      "content": "Since we launched Alchemix v2 in March, we have seen a significant amount of TVL move from v1 to v2, aided by the migration tool we provided for Alchemix users. Despite having this tool and several months to migrate, there are still over 10k ETH and 50m DAI locked in v1. The Alchemix team would like to sunset the old v1 contracts, and we have now developed and prepared a method for migrating the v1 positions into v2.\n\nThe process of migrating involves a few steps. First, we will increase the deposit caps on v2 to allow for the migrated funds to be deposited into v2. Then, we will deploy new v1 vault adapters for both DAI and WETH. Next, when we initiate these vaults for the migration process, all underlying collateral in v1 will be withdrawn from Yearn and sent to the new vault adapter. Once this action is taken, user funds will be held idle in this new adapter until each user performs the migration for their account (a UI will be provided for this step).\n\nIn order to migrate, users will call withdraw(1) on the v1 Alchemist. For v1 users, their exact balance and debt at the time of the migration will be carried over to v2. So, if Alice has 100k DAI deposited and 30k alUSD debt in v1, after the migration, she would have 0 deposit and 0 debt in v1, and an additional 100k deposit plus 30k debt added to their account in v2. Since v1 uses the yvDAI and yvWETH vaults, their balances will be migrated to the yvDAI and yvWETH vaults in v2, respectively. Users can then migrate to other vaults within v2 if they so choose.\n\nThe Alchemix team has completed all the development work of this migrator already, and it has passed several rounds of internal audits. The team is very confident in the safety of this operation, but, as always, there are unknown risks involved at the smart contract level.\n\nThe Alchemix team understands that some users may prefer to not take any risks during the migration and complete the process manually. Consequently, we will give the remaining v1 users before the week of September the 12th following the passing of this vote to either manually migrate or close their v1 positions before beginning the automatic migration process.\n\nA vote “For” approves of the migration plan\n\nA vote “Against” rejects the migration plan.",

      "title": "[AIP 48] Tokemak CoRE 3 Vote Allocation",
      "content": "# Introduction\n\nAlchemix has been accumulating TOKE since it gained an ALCX Token Reactor as part of the first Collateralization of Reactors Event (C.o.R.E). The third C.o.R.E event is currently running and will determine the next 5 protocols to receive a Token Reactor. [ https://medium.com/tokemak/c-o-r-e-3-voting-begins-this-monday-may-2nd-1687ff492199 ] There are now less than 4 days remaining before the vote closes on Monday, May 9 @ 7PM UTC.\n\nAlchemix now holds over 200k TOKE and as one of the largest holders, has significant voting power (nb. 1 staked TOKE equates to 6 votes). This voting power is attractive to protocols that are competing for a Token Reactor, and they are therefore offering voting incentives to voters.\n\n# TLDR;\n***It is proposed to authorise the Alchemix core team, together with the Alchemix BizDev SubDAO, to allocate the full amount of Alchemix TOKE votes according to the best offers available in the final day(s) of C.o.R.E 3 voting.***\n\nIf approved, the team will provide a follow-up post detailing final voting allocation, as well as the rationale behind the distribution.\n\n# Rationale\n\nBroadly speaking, there are three options available to Alchemix for the use of its voting power:\n1. Make one or more OTC deals with other protocols, where Alchemix is offered a benefit in return for votes. Typically this will be a fixed amount of another token per vote, but creative deals may arise. These deals are bespoke and will likely require that Alchemix does not subsequently exchange the received token for something else, but will also typically mean that Alchemix would not be subject to vote dilution (i.e. the incentive offered is fixed, but the number of votes for any given protocol is variable, so the per-vote reward claimable by Alchemix will be dependent on how many other votes the protocol ends up attracting).\n\nRelating to OTC deals, Paladin [ https://www.paladin.vote/ ] has already proposed an offer of Paladin tokens to the value of $0.12/vote. The Paladin deal also includes an obligation for Paladin to find an equal or better deal elsewhere should they not need the votes. https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/322-vote-for-paladin-in-tokemaks-core-event-3\n\n2. Pursue incentive via the redacted Hidden Hand platform [ https://hiddenhand.finance/tokemak ] (formerly known as Votemak). These incentives come with no obligations and so can be readily exchanged for any other token at the discretion of Alchemix. However, Hidden Hand incentives are subject to vote dilution when the number of votes allocated to a particular protocol increases.\n\n3. Delegate to the Alchemix core team and BizDev SubDAO to select an appropriate mix of options (1) and (2) based on the offers available at the time.\n\nVoting in C.o.R.E 3 is gasless, and it’s possible to change votes repeatedly up until the event is over. This means that a large number of votes are likely to be withheld until the final hours, at which point the jostling for positioning will probably occur.\n\nGiven that the voting landscape may change rapidly on the final day and even in the final hours, the lead time involved in handling a snapshot vote implicitly means that it’s not feasible to have the final voting allocation determined directly by governance if we wish to be responsive to additional offers that arrive in the final hours or days of the vote.\n\n\n",

      "content": "The core event will end in 1 day and 17 hours. While this is short notice due to much of the team being off last week, we on the core team would like to propose that Alchemix use all 440,098 TOKE voting power on a CRV reactor.\n\nThe primary reason to vote for Curve is that the CRV token is more or less the backbone of much of DeFi and promoting its health and liquidity is beneficial for ALL OF DEFI. As of now, it has no direct pool2 incentives, leading to relatively illiquid markets compared to some of their counterparts with a pool2. A Tokemak reactor for CRV would help increase the liquidity for CRV and give CRV holders another source of yield, which would increase demand for CRV. \n\nOne interesting thing we learned from the previous reactor events is that even if you don't win, you can carry your votes onto the next round. So even with Alchemix's support, CRV is unlikely to win, but despite that, it would put them in a much better position to win the next round. I think it is Alchemix's best interest to see a successful Curve, and we should support them when given the opportunity since they have given back so much to the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nFor this proposal, we will give the DAO two choices.\n\nChoice 1: Vote with all of the DAO's power for CRV.\nChoice 2: Spread out votes proportionally to bribe amounts.\n\nIf the DAO does not get behind the CRV vote, then the most neutral and expedient option is to follow the bribes on votemak and vote accordingly.\n",
