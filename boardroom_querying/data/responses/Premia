      "content": "TLDR; Time to Vote on the next Premia Parliament electorate class!\nTo meet the candidates, check out the [Forums](https://forum.premia.finance/t/p3-proposal-parliament-election-term-2)\n\n## Introduction:\nAs a result of the growing maturity of The Premia Ecosystem and an increasing need for community involvement, the Premia Parliament was founded last year. The Parliament has been working as a joint task force of Premia Core contributors and Elected Community members to ratify and complete the formal path to a Decentralized Organization. The Parliament oversaw the Meta Economic revamp before the launch of Premia Blue (v3), the launch itself, and the consequent sunsetting of v2.\n\nDebates are encouraged, and formal documentation and voting ratifications will be frequent. 10 members of the community will be elected and ultimately asked to step forward to lead the Premia Ecosystem to the next chapter of our collective journey.\n\n## Purpose:\nTo elevate 10 community members to join the Premia Parliament to formalize the path to a Decentralized Organization. Goals will include, but are not limited to the following:\n\n- Discuss and Outline new initiatives that are co-partnerships between developers and participants.\n\n- Focus group review of new features and future product lines.\n\n- Documentation of the canon or doctrine that future Parliament members must uphold.\n\n- To streamline continuous ratifications through weekly Parliament member votes, that will then be wrapped into omnibus bills to be ratified by popular vote on a monthly basis.\n\n- To democratize the P3 process and appoint multiple organizational entities that can accelerate the governance process in a responsible yet efficient manner.\n\n- To discuss and outline any potential changes to Premia tokenomics, Commission splits, & all things regarding the meta economy aspects of Premia Blue.\n\n## Expectations & Requirements:\nPlease review the below before submitting an application as below are the expectations and requirements of Parliament members:\n\nMinimum of 8hrs per month, up to 20hrs per month. Weekly call attendance will be mandatory, and you will be expected to regularly communicate with other Parliament members, Community members, and Core members.\n\nYou may be assigned or allowed to choose a role you will focus more on, between Governance, Advocation, Community, and Quality Assurance. As one of ten elected esteemed community members, you will assist and advise relevant core team members based on your assigned role. Members may also contribute to any of the aforementioned categories if they desire to fulfill more than one role.\n\nThe estimated length of engagement for the second Parliament is ~6 months or 1 million mainnet blocks.\n\nWe will be meeting virtually over Discord (no video necessary), and progression will be tracked transparently to easily communicate with the broader group on action items and how the extended community can raise concerns will be publicly outlined and addressed.\n\nWe will be using Clarity for internal documentation and drafting proposals.\n\nParliament Term 2 Compensation: ~6000 Premia per month, aiming at roughly $2000/mo at current rates.\n\n## Voting Clarification:\n\nThe top 10 candidates in order of most influence cast will be ratified as Parliament Members (Weighted Voting). Candidates MAY vote for themselves. Contrary to other protocol elections, this is acceptable.\n\nIn the event that fewer than 10 candidates receive votes, then only the candidates with votes will be accepted, and the Parliament will be formed with less than 10 initial members.\n\nTo see the results from the inaugural Parliament, go [here](https://gov.premia.blue/#/proposal/0x011d101a569caeff821d3dce2b7319fdd0db1c560b7e564ec763213620b4914b)\n\n[To Learn about the applicants, please check the Forums!](https://forum.premia.finance/t/p3-proposal-parliament-election-term-2/249)\n\n| Name | Address | Discord Username |\n| ---- | ---- | ---- |\n| JC Denton | 0xF7453c580f00394764b9927F2aD42e2c627e9DBD | jc.denton. |\n| CryptoFox69 | 0xbB3810f612Ba194873Af99DCFf0Ff46e2168590E | CryptoFox69 |\n| Fin4DAO | 0x1AEC250C13b1214C4B9935Db3C8a7610fdAaE8dD | fin4dao |\n| David | 0x8d240b9f99e2a631ffCfbC05996Edd285b7015aC | wagecuck17 aka Sminem |\n| Sidelined | 0x3771FaEaF312455F8656c0e6179D66Df29b87f03 | vxside |\n| Salty | 0xe52046823fB5854125775f372803E2c4b9517Eb2 | 0xsalty |\n| vxToasted | 0x1BdC67207A23E734586ebbA29DCfdabcb4d01d1F | vxToasted |\n| vxAlgorithmicx | 0x9B11C9C4D15aa569A740e9C45D2B043099125763 | vxAlgorithmicx |\n| sunny (s64, sunny64) | 0x33f470A2445811AeEC51e14ff203e9BD2D55C15b | s642655 |\n| David Lynch | 0x3B243cB113B3b46BD35444b1998b8f4368777aE0 | 0xlynch |\n| vxDenpa | 0x728914Fc0211b24EaA3277E2Ab1D4E4B41AAA322 | vxDenpa |\n| mjp | 0xF8ae7bD5466Ad601F86EAd69d2443037Fa2CdB06 | mjp |\n| marty | 0x1E73259A07574b303AaF1601bE3B128644A8FAba | therealmarty |\n| Fluffy Bear | 0x00820d4CBa697c55452F58bCEb572E5B5453F3d1 | fluffy.bear |\n| lyt | 0x12b19C5857CF92AaE5e5e5ADc6350e25e4C902e9 | lyt.eth |\n| snips (Tammy WorldPower) | 0x14BB96792BC2058D59AF8b098F1C4fF69267968f | snips. |\n| Michael (General Obligation) | 0x47e0eBB7bdDb604cD1EF086f68012f9e75e63E19 | GeneralObligation |",

      "content": "---\n![P3.6.png](ipfs://bafybeibl6a3b2zh3vlqw4ifyfnixoyzg6kfzpuooffkb35jw67vmwrtx5e)\nDetails on 6.P3 can be found on the [FORUM](https://forum.premia.finance/t/p3-proposal-parliament-fast-track-monthly-parliamentary-bill-process/) or [GITHUB](https://github.com/Premia-Gov/gov-genesis/blob/1aee5a6b6ba7c960bc09953a1ef4acb127856785/_civitas/Registry/P3/content/published/6.P3/6.P3.md)\n---\n\n# Summary\n\nThis comprehensive proposal introduces a dynamic governance framework for Premia, combining monthly consolidation of Parliamentary topics aka \"The Bill\" and \"Parliament Fast Track\" mechanisms. It seeks to expedite governance proposals optimistically while promoting transparency. Parliament Fast Track aims to expedite specific proposals while ensuring full sovereignty over protocol decisions. First, traditional proposals for non-critical topics will move to weekly Parliament discretion (Fast Track), and then monthly, these items will be consolidated into an omnibus bill for stakeholder ratification, thus empowering all Premian Tokenholders in the decision-making process.\n\n## Parliament-Only Snapshot Space\n\n- Each member gets 1 vote, regardless of vxPremia influence.\n- Used for Signal Votes and Parliament Fast Track.\n- Located within the premia.eth Snapshot (parliament.premia.eth), this snapshot space serves as the venue for Parliamentary voting. Proposals can be presented publicly and voted on in this space: [parliament.premia.blue](https://parliament.premia.blue).\n- The Blue Descent Multisig has been created and can be seen at: [Blue Descent Multisig](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=arb1:0x8Fb7A635164fb693350AaB6dF8f53d82Df7AABA0). This multisig has had oSnap enabled, and will soon enforce Hats Protocol permissions for voting.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis proposal introduces a process where Parliament's weekly proposals are consolidated into a monthly bill, which is then voted on by all Premian Tokenholders. Additionally, it establishes the Parliament Fast Track for efficient decision-making on certain proposals.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal aims to enhance community participation, transparency, and governance efficiency, while not putting stakeholders under governance fatigue. By consolidating weekly parliamentary votes into a monthly bill for tokenholder voting, decisions will reflect the broader consensus of the Premia community. This proposal also introduces a structured review process that thoroughly examines decisions made within the month.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis change requires an update to the parliamentary voting and tokenholder voting procedures:\n\n- Weekly parliamentary voting proceeds as usual.\n- At the end of each month, all proposals voted on are collated into a single bill.\n- This bill is then put up for a vote by all Premian Influence Holders.\n- The vote is open for a standard period, after which the results are finalized.\n- If the bill is rejected, then the previous action is reverted, and a formal discussion on the forum will be initiated to discuss how to proceed before submitting another proposal on next steps.\n- The bill, containing all accepted fast-tracked proposals, is then considered ratified. If the bill is rejected, then the previous action is reverted, and a formal discussion on the forum will be initiated to discuss how to proceed before submitting another proposal on next steps.\n\n## Parliament Fast Track\n\n- Proposals intended for approval via the fast track procedure must comply with the formatting requirements established in 1.P3 Premian Publication Process. To distinguish them from those approved by the standard process, the title should be formatted in the following way: [x].P3-FT [Title of the proposal].\n- Votes will be carried out in the Premia Parliament Voter Portal subspace on Snapshot. All 10 members of Parliament will be entitled to cast 1 vote with equal weight, regardless of the vxPremia influence of each member. A core member of the Premia team will be entitled to cast 1 vote only in the event of a tie. Votes passing by a majority decision (6 votes).\n- Every month or after 5 proposals have been approved in the Fast Track Process (whichever comes first), all approved proposals will be packaged into an omnibus bill and subject to a vote by all vxPremia token holders.\n- Default proposal length will be 48 hours, however once majority has been reached (6) action may proceed.\n\nThis ensures that:\n\n- The broader community regularly expresses its will.\n- The omnibus bills do not creep in scope (max 5 proposals) to a point where it is impractical for voters to study the bill.\n- Proposals that hypothetically get repealed by the broader community will at most have been running for a month.\n\nThe following subjects will NOT be eligible for approval through the Fast Track procedure:\n\n- Core Governance Amendments\n- Token Economics\n- Proposals with a value of more than $100,000 or involving token transfers of more than 100,000 Premia. *(Note: in the future the DAO should draw up a quarterly budget and get it approved by stakeholders. This clause would then only apply to new spending items that were not part of the current budget)*\n\n## oSnap Module and Snapshot Voting for Parliament\n\nThe oSnap Module, provided by UMA, integrates with Snapshot to enable on-chain transactions to be included with Snapshot proposals. oSnap allows Parliament members to vote on proposals, facilitating democratic decision-making and initiating a multisig transaction if needed. The subdomain snapshot space can be found at [parliament.premia.blue.](https://parliament.premia.blue). The next few weeks will act as an initialization phase to familiarize with the features oSnap provides before passing responsibilities to the multisig.\n\n## Hats Protocol for Entitlements\n\nThe Hats Protocol provides a framework for assigning different roles and access levels to participants within Blue Descent. It allows for fine-grained control over governance by enabling the creation of different roles or \"hats.\" These different roles are then enforced on-chain via the Hats Protocol's credentialing system and suite of smart contracts.\n\nKey Features:\n\n- Granular control over decision-making capabilities.\n- Customizable roles and responsibilities for participants.\n- Utilize the Hats Protocol for effective management of permissions and entitlements.\n\n## Some of the first tasks to be completed via the fast-tracked procedure\n\nPremia's governance framework, Blue Descent, offers a robust and democratic system for administration. The Parliament championing this will ensure transparent and efficient decision-making processes using oSnap, Snapshot, and the Hats Protocol. Once these utilities are activated the parliament will focus on the first fast-track tasks, such as code of conduct, proposal quorum, length, etc.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nIf approved, these processes would run for the remaining duration of the first Premian Legislature. The effectiveness and proper functioning would be assessed after elections and the formation of the second parliament legislature.\n\n## Copyright Waiver\n\nThis P3 is in the public domain, and the author waives all copyright and related rights to the extent possible under the law.\n\n## References\n\n- [**oSnap Quick Start Guide**](https://docs.uma.xyz/developers/osnap/osnap-quick-start)\n- [**Snapshot Governance Platform**](https://gov.premia.blue/)\n- [**Background on Snapshot Voting System**](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-snapshot-the-decentralized-voting-system)\n- [**Parliament Formation**](https://notes.premia.community/parliament-formation)\n- [**Parliament P3 Repository**](https://github.com/Premia-Gov/gov-genesis/tree/main/_civitas/Registry/P3/content/published)\n- [**Premia Governance Primer**](https://docs.premia.blue/the-premia-protocol/governance)\n- [**Hats Protocol**](https://www.hatsprotocol.xyz/)",

Additionally, Premia V2 on Ethereum, Fantom, and Arbitrum will be sunsetted, and users will be encouraged to withdraw liquidity and migrate to Premia Blue on Arbitrum.\n\nDetails on 5.P3 can be found on the [FORUM](https://forum.premia.finance/t/p3-proposal-halting-emissions-on-v2-and-migrating-to-premia-blue/227) or [GITHUB](https://github.com/Premia-Gov/gov-genesis/blob/3240201d323d0321108a7ad54aa0ccbdce45e202/_civitas/Registry/P3/content/published/5.P3/5.P3P.md)\n\n### Proposal Details:\n\n##### 1) Halting Emissions on V2:\nEffective from August 31, 2023 at 23:59 PM UTC, emissions on the Premia V2 platform will cease entirely.\nThis action is intended to encourage users and liquidity providers to transition to Premia Blue, optimizing the community’s efforts and aligning with the latest protocol version. The transition to Premia Blue will enable the protocol to incentivize new features and enhance operational efficiency.\n\n##### 2) Migration to Premia Blue:\nAll users, liquidity providers, and stakeholders currently utilizing Premia V2 on Ethereum, Fantom, and Arbitrum are strongly encouraged to migrate their activities and assets to Premia Blue on Arbitrum Network. Migration to Premia Blue offers improved features and opportunities, contributing to the growth and advancement of the enhanced version of the protocol.\n\n###### 3) Communication and Awareness:\nComprehensive communication efforts will ensure a seamless transition and keep all stakeholders well-informed. The Premia team will provide clear migration guides and educational materials and conduct community Q&A sessions to address any queries or concerns related to the migration to Premia Blue.\n\n###### 4) Sunsetting of Premia V2 on Ethereum, Fantom, and Arbitrum:\nUsers are encouraged to withdraw liquidity from Premia V2 instances on Ethereum, Fantom, and Arbitrum.\nStarting from August 31, 2023 at 23:59 PM UTC, new option quotes and underwriting on Premia V2 will be discontinued. However, open options can still be exercised before or upon expiration.\n\n### Implementation Plan:\n##### Snapshot Proposal: \nThe proposal will be presented to the community on the Snapshot platform, allowing stakeholders to vote and express their support or objection.\n\n##### Voting Period: \nA predetermined voting period (e.g., 7 days) will ensure ample community participation and representation time.\n\n##### Threshold for Approval: \nThe proposal requires a minimum approval threshold of 51% of the total voting power applied.\n\n##### Execution: \nUpon receiving the necessary approval, emissions on Premia V2 will halt on August 31, 2023, at 23:59 PM UTC. The team will initiate a comprehensive migration process guiding users to Premia Blue on Arbitrum. Subsequently, Emission rewards will then migrate from V2 Pools to V3 Vaults shortly after that.\n\n##### Post-Implementation Evaluation: \nAfter the migration to Premia Blue and the cessation of emissions on V2, a post-implementation evaluation will be conducted to assess the changes’ impact and gather community feedback if needed.\n\n### Conclusion: \nThis governance proposal aims to transition the Premia ecosystem from V2 to Premia Blue (V3), enhancing protocol sustainability and growth. By halting emissions on V2 and encouraging a seamless migration to Premia Blue, the protocol can focus its resources on the latest version, ensuring its long-term success and value to the community. However, the claim process for the new options liquidity mining may be delayed (eta middle of September when permissionless pool and referrals go live); the assumption moving forward will be to allow for a seamless transition of liquidity mining accruals starting at the same time of the halt on V2 (August 31, 2023, at 23:59 PM UTC).\n\n#### References: \n[[xPost from Discord Forum]](https://discord.com/channels/777808124341649440/1140348344628166779)\n[[xPost from Discourse Forum]](https://forum.premia.finance/t/p3-proposal-halting-emissions-on-v2-and-migrating-to-premia-blue/227)",

The key components of the proposed changes are the revised token allocation re-categorizations, protocol fee structure, Insurance Fund, vxPremia, voting influence, Hydraulic Solutions Framework & Options Liquidity Mining, and the AirDrip Initiative.\n\nDetails on 4.P3 can be found on the [FORUM](https://forum.premia.finance/t/p3-proposal-premia-meta-economics-revamp/220) or [GITHUB](https://github.com/Premia-Gov/gov-genesis/tree/69b848b3b27009fb20f1faac2942ad3ec4cac50b/_civitas/Registry/P3/content/published/4.P3)\n\n### Motivation\nThe maturity and adoption of the DeFi ecosystem necessitates secure, responsive, and responsible protocols. Premia recognizes the need to reassess and reinvent its token meta-economic design to meet these requirements. The proposed changes aim to align with the evolving interests of the community, empower stakeholders, and ensure the long-term success of the Premia protocol.\n\n#### Abstract\nAs the Web3 universe evolves, the Premia ecosystem must adapt and mature. The proposed revamp of token economics aims to empower and reward stakeholders while maintaining decentralization. This P3 proposal outlines the revised token allocation, the structure of protocol fees, the introduction of the Insurance Fund, the mechanism of vxPremia and voting influence, the adoption of the Hydraulic Solutions Framework & Options Liquidity Mining, and the implementation of the AirDrip Initiative.\n\n#### Voting Clarification:\nVote For/In Support of the outlined Premia Token Economics Changes\nDO Implement\n\nVote Against/In Opposition of the outlined Premia Token Economics Changes\nDO NOT Implement\n\n#### Airdrip Snapshot Date\nUpon completing this vote, a snapshot block will be announced for the week of August 1st, 2023, via Premia Finance Twitter.

The Parliament will be a joint task force of Premia Core members and Elected Community members to ratify and complete the formal path to a Decentralized Organization.  Debates are encouraged, and formal documentation and voting ratifications will be frequent.  10 members of the community will be elected and ultimately asked to step forward to lead the Premia Ecosystem to the next chapter of our collective journey.\n\nDuring the election process questions may be directed to candidates in the discord.

Also, the FDV/TVL figure for Premia sits at 16.2x, quite high compared to 6.7x for Dopex, or 1.45x for GMX.  Premia’s current emissions is at 1.8m tokens for 2022, or 1.8% of total supply.  Despite Premia having higher volume, a superior UI/UX, and the ability to trade American options,  Dopex’s market cap is 6x greater than that of Premia.  While updated tokenomics and V3 will help, (Dopex also has an upcoming V2), the market cap differential will be difficult to compress without materially reducing the FDV.  \n\nProposal & motivation\nBurn 60% of excess supply, which would make Premia more attractive on a relative value basis to other options and real yield protocols.  This would take the total supply to 30m tokens, leaving room for 16.7 years of farming incentives (based on the 2022 rates).  It would also take the Circulating Supply/Total Supply to 35% and the FDV/TVL to 4.9x.   This would encourage new buyers from adding Premia and lead to more attractive relative value comparison to other real yield protocols. \n\n",

      "content": "### Simple Summary:\n\nThe Knox Finance team proposes the addition of a staked ETH(wstETH) market on arbitrum. The market serves the following purposes. 1.) It allows Premia LPs to earn yield while their assets are idle as well as while in use. 2.) It allows potential arbitrage between the ETH and wstETH pool creating a more efficient market 2.) It allows Premia and Knox finance to tap into the Lido community(marketing, liquidity mining programs, future integrations). \n\n### Abstract\nThis proposal is to garner support for adding a new options market for wstETH. wstETH is a liquid staked ETH product managed by Lido. wstETH (or wrapped staked-ETH is the non-rebasing version of the stETH (staked-ETH) product. Currently both stETH and wstETH are exclusively on mainnet but in the coming weeks and months wstETH will be bridged to L2 chains like Arbitrum. \n\n\n### Specification and Implementation: \nArbitrum: \nLaunch wstETH/DAI pools on Arbitrum when Chainlink price feed is made available. This will allow Premia to create a market from zero liquidity. Previous proposals have stated the data collection required for surface creation takes approximately a week. \n\n(Optional) Mainnet:\nLaunch wstETH/DAI on mainnet immediately. The appropriate price feeds are available via Chainlink.\nChainlink Price Feeds below:  \nhttps://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/steth-usd\n\n### Motivation\nLido is the biggest and most liquid staked ETH derivative. The creation of a wstETH/DAI market allows for a variety of opportunities to be accessed. \n\nFurthermore, the Lido core team encourages these connections and can supports integrations with marketing/publicity efforts. Moreover, by being an initial use case for wstETH on arbitrum Premia and Knox finance have the opportunity to gain a significant portion of the wstETH market share on arbitrum. \n\nFinally, the Lido community is discussing a new liquidity mining(LM) program for the launch of wstETH on L2s. Combining Lido’s LM program with Premia’s LM program creates opportunity for increased adoption for the pool. \n\n### Voting Options: \n* 1.) Approve the addition of stETH market on arbitrum when Chainlink oracles become available\n* 2.) Approve the creation of a stETH/DAI market on Mainnet now and Arbitrum when Chainlink oracles become available\n* 3.) Do not approve the addition stETH/DAI market\n\n\nAs stated above this proposal is to garner support for a stETH/DAI market. If the community approves the addition of stETH/DAI pool, an additional proposal will be made to determine potential change in emission to pools. \n\n\n\n\n",

With the release of the protocol on the Fantom network, it may make sense to incentivize these new pools with Liquidity Mining rewards. To ensure alignment of vision and incentives between Liquidity Providers, Holders, and the Protocol, a multiple choice selection for Fantom emissions is being presented.\n\nSpecification and Implementation\nThe current emission schedule is as follows:\n\nEthereum L1: 600k (33% of 1.8M) PREMIA per year\n                         (~0.25 PREMIA per block)\nArbitrum: 1.2M (66% of 1.8M) PREMIA per year\n                         (~0.5 PREMIA per block)\n\nWith the release of the protocol on the Fantom network, Premia would implement one of the following emission schemes:\n\n- Increase total emissions from 1.8M to 3M, giving the additional 1.2M PREMIA per year (~0.5 PREMIA per block) to Fantom LPs, bringing the new split between Mainnet / Arbitrum / Fantom to 20% / 40% / 40%, respectively\n\n- Split existing 1.8M PREMIA (~0.75 PREMIA per mainnet block) emissions between Mainnet / Arbitrum / Fantom w/ a 15% / 50% / 35% split\n\n- Split existing 1.8M PREMIA (~0.75 PREMIA per mainnet block) emissions between Mainnet / Arbitrum / Fantom w/ a 25% / 50% / 25% split\n\n- No change to emission rates (no Liquidity Mining rewards for Fantom LPs)\n\nThis agreed upon emission rate would go active with the release of the protocol on the Fantom network.\n\nMotivation\nContinue to provide emissions that reflect and align with Premia's long term vision, prevent unnecessary dilution, and provide sustainable reward systems.\n\nChoices:\n- Increase emissions by 1.2M PREMIA per year to incentivize Fantom LPs\n  (20% Ethereum L1 / 40% Arbitrum / 40% Fantom)\n- Split existing emissions 15% Ethereum L1 / 50% Arbitrum / 35% Fantom\n- Split existing emissions 25% Ethereum L1 / 50% Arbitrum / 25% Fantom\n- No change to emissions (no liquidity mining rewards for Fantom LPs) ",

      "content": "\n### Executive Summary\n\nThe Knox Vault team is seeking a grant from Premia to build passive DeFi options vaults (DOVs) on top of the Premia Protocol to facilitate the next $100M+ of capital into the ecosystem.  \n\n#### Knox Vault Team\n\nOur core contributors came together while building on the hackathons circuit. We cover the gambit of full-stack blockchain-engineer, monetary policy, data analytics, and community building. We have been in it for the tech since 2016. \n\nCourtney - Over 5 years of experience as a full stack developer and analyst for startups and enterprise companies. Contributed to several production web3 projects in the past including beefy.finance.\n\nCaesar: Initially joined the web3 ecosystem in 2016, leading operations and community engagement including participating and building relationships with market makers to create index products and DAO support for this community. Startup experience, successfully scaled teams and revenue, within the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nAdditional support will come from Knox Vault DAO contributor group. This includes full stack developers and financial engineers with experience building, trading, and creating algorithms for option and equities markets. \n\n#### How Fort Knox works\nFort Knox team is creating passively managed options strategies better known as DeFi Options Vaults (DOV)\n* Each week users can deposit assets into the DOV to be utilized in predetermined option strategies\n* Initial strategies will include Covered Calls & Put Selling\n* The Fort Knox vault utilizes users' capital to collateralize and generate the appropriate amount of options contracts to be sold in the epoch. \n* Options are available for purchase by anyone until 48 hours prior to the end of epoch \n* At the end of the epoch the premium earned is distributed to vault participants\n* Vault users can either exit the vault or allow assets to roll over to the next epoch\n* Fort Knox team aims to give premia users access the best yield earning structured products and diverse risk profiles\nBenefits to Premia\n* Fort Knox vaults offer Premia users a consistent and known weekly yield on users assets. \n* Fort Knox will distribute 20% of the revenue generated back to Premia treasury for vaults built utilizing the Premia Protocol.\n* Fort Knox team will build and open-source the infrastructure tools needed to enable others to build more structured products on top of Premia\n* The options volume generated by the initial structured product strategies will be sourced from Premia. \n* Fort Knox team plans to educate and bring new market makers into the Premia Options ecosystem. \n* Fort Knox team will engage with Premia and partners to co-market and educate new and old user base \n* The Fort Knox team reasonably expects to drive at least 20m-100m liquidity to the Premia ecosystem.  \n* Post Initial Launch exclusivity to the Premia Platform for 3 months, post this time the strategies will become more complex thus additional protocols will need to be utilized.\n* To keep the Fort Knox team accountable, their team will submit a transparency report in relation to the use of grant funds monthly until funds have been fully utilized.\n\n#### Grant Funding Request\nThe Knox vault team is asking for 250,000 USDC tokens to be distributed as needed by multi-signature release.  In addition Knox is requesting 50,000 PREMIA tokens to be allocated and locked for max duration to reduce fees paid by Knox and align incentives of both communities.\n\nExpected expense items highlighted below: \n* Solidity Development\n* Financial Engineering \n* Design Services\n* Software Engineering\n* Audits & Security \n* Freelance Services, as needed \n* Infrastructure & Data Services \n* Legal, Entity Structuring, etc.\n* Miscellaneous/Other\n\n",

Upon replacement of this fee, the protocol will no longer charge a nominal fee on settlement, rather, the protocol will now charge a 2.5% interest-based fee, determined by the amount of capital and the length of time the position was held open.\n\nAs protocol stakers receive the majority (currently 80%) of protocol fees, this fee will ensure that long-term supporters of the protocol are rewarded for providing and incentivizing utilization of pool capital. In addition to this, with the introduction of further tokenomics upgrades (such as vePREMIA), this fee becomes more important as it ensures protocol stakers are highly incentivized to direct Liquidity Mining yields to the pools with the highest potential utilization returns.

      "title": "Modify emissions for YFI support",
      "content": "**Simple Summary**\nYFI / DAI markets were added to Premia on both Ethereum and Arbitrum.\n\nThe proposal below is to find an agreed-upon emission rate for the YFI / DAI markets on Ethereum mainnet and Arbitrum.\n\n**Abstract**\nThis proposal is to gauge sentiment/support for updating the emission rate of $PREMIA to provide incentive support to a new partner on Premia.\n\nYearn is one of a few protocols in which Premia is looking to build a deeper relationship with through supporting markets, strategies, and potentially native vault integrations. Adding YFI only makes sense given the level of involvement in which Premia looks to integrate with the Yearn protocol in the future. \n\nWhile in talks with Yearn, Premia was aware of their upcoming Arbitrum deployment so prepped a surface to support a market to coincide with their L2 launch. The launch came at an unexpected time, so rather than wait to set emissions prior, YFI markets were deployed to align with their launch and the same emissions applied to the ALCX pools were applied to the YFI pools to start. \n\n**Specification and Implementation**\nEmissions would be allocated for a minimum of 1 month, and a weekly review allows the community to shift those weights based on the pool’s utilization rates until a more permanent system (vePREMIA) is put in place.\n\nWe are excited about the addition of the YFI/DAI token pair to the platform. Yearn is a long-time backbone of DeFi, pioneering their yield aggregation platform. The addition of their protocol token market will add value for Premia users who would like deeper exposure to more DeFi-native assets.\n\nYearn users will also be happy to find market-competitive yield on their YFI, while Premia users will be excited by potential new yield and trading opportunities made available by this new market.\n\n**Motivation**\nAs a partner Premia looks to work closely with as Premia grows, we'd like to welcome Yearn warmly to the Premia family, while still being conscious of dilution caused by pool emissions. There are many interesting ways that Premia and Yearn could integrate with one another and we see this as the beginning of a fruitful partnership to offer an additional way to soon access capital-efficient yields and options markets.\n\n**Clarification**\nThe current pool emission weight allocations per asset group are as follows.\n\nArbitrum:\nWETH: (50%)\nWBTC: (33.33%)\nLINK: (16.66%)\n\nMainnet:\nWETH (35%)\nWBTC (25%)\nalETH (15%)\nALCX (15%)\nLINK (10%)\n\nAfter the addition of YFI pool rewards, the updated emissions are as follows.\n\nArbitrum:\nWETH: (41%)\nWBTC: (27.5%)\nLINK: (13.5%)\nYFI (18%)\n\nMainnet:\nWETH (30%)\nWBTC (22.5%)\nalETH (13%)\nALCX (13%)\nYFI (13%)\nLINK (8.5%)\n\nThe per-block emissions will stay at the previously voted on 0.75 PREMIA per block.\n\n - Vote in Favor/In Support of: adding emissions to the YFI markets\n\n- Vote Against/In Opposition of: adding emissions to the YFI markets \n",

      "content": "**Simple Summary**\nProvide a one-time grant of 235,000 EUR equivalent of stablecoins to the Vaults Pro team to assist in getting them from \"0 to 1\".\n\n**Background**\nPremia has funds set aside specifically for providing grants to projects and protocols looking to add value to the Premia ecosystem. \nPremia was recently approached by the Vaults Pro team regarding receiving funding to build a structured product utilizing Premia's AMM and option Pools.\n\nThe Vaults Pro team recognizes Premia technology as industry-leading and is seeking a grant to enable anyone to create strategies on top of the Premia protocol, in combination with other money legos. Vaults Pro expects to drive at least 10m-100m of liquidity to the Premia pools. Vaults Pro also proposes to jointly develop the open-source middleware needed to make integrations with Premia seamless.\n\nFull formal proposal submit from the Vaults Pro team can be seen in #proposal-drafts-and-talk at discord.gg/premia.\n\n**Specification and Implementation**\nPremia would provide the Vaults Pro team 235,000 EUR equivalent of stablecoins. This grant would cover the expenses for the following:\n\n• Corporate structuring\n• Legal relationship setup\n• Legal risk mitigation strategy\n• UI prototype design\n• Front-end engineering costs\n• Solidity engineering costs\n• Financial engineering research\n• Miscellaneous admin expenses\n\nTo keep the Vaults Pro team accountable, their team will submit a transparency report in relation to the use of grant funds monthly until funds have been fully utilized.\n\n**Motivation**\nThrough cooperation with the Vaults Pro team, this proposal has the benefits of:\n\n• Enabling anyone to create strategies on top of Premia in combination with other protocols.\n• Collaborate with the Premia team on open-source middleware software to reduce frictions of building on top of Premia.\n• The options volume for Vaults Pro will be primarily sourced from Premia unless demand exceeds supply.\n• Expects to drive at least 10m-100m liquidity to the Premia pools.\n• Coordinate feature releases and engage in co-marketing events.\n• Premia will receive several “verified vault” spots on the Vaults main page.\n• Continually educate its users on how to use the Premia protocol for risk management and trading purposes.\n\n",

It will also have options for using the ETH treasury, and minting more tokens, to add liquidity without paying Olympus DAO and the premia community for it. There will be a NO option as well.\n\nEMISSIONS: \nThe amount of money used will be 250k notational value, depending on vote - i.e. if ETH is used from the treasury. About 100k premia tokens will be used if purchasing liquidity from the Olympus (Ohm Pro) Bond market. Or, if single-side entering the LP, the ETH or Premia will be bought so that about 50k Premia and the equivalent in ETH are used. The actual amount will vary slightly given market conditions.\n\nVOTING OPTIONS:\n\n1) use ohm pro on arbitrum, 250k usd notational of premia to start \n2) use treasury eth + devFund premia, in a 50/50 ratio worth 250k usd notational, and directly create liquidity. no market operations.\n3) single side enter LP with ETH (market buy premia into LP)\n4) single side enter LP with premia (market sell premia into LP)\n5) do nothing \n",

      "content": "### Simple Summary\nUse a portion of the treasury ETH to mint alETH on Alchemix to provide liquidity in the alETH call pool. \n\n### Background\nPremia recently announced adding ALCX/DAI and alETH/alUSD options markets. Alongside this announcement Premia passed a governance proposal to include these new markets in the increased liquidity mining incentives. \n\nAlchemix also passed AIP-33, a governance proposal to deposit 3,000 ALCX into the ALCX/DAI market to increase liquidity. \n\n### Specification and Implementation\nPremia owns approximately 12,172 ETH in the treasury as of 1/22/2022. (yes, you read that right. it’s a massive treasury 🤯) The purpose of this proposal would be to use 400* ETH (~$1,000,000) of the treasury to mint 200 alETH and deposit into the alETH call pool. This would roughly match the Alchemix proposal of 3,000 ALCX which was ~$1,000,000 at the time AIP-33 was written. \n\nIn addition, Alchemix stated, _“While not part of this [AIP-33] proposal, if the community wants to expand the size of these markets at a later date, we can consider offering ALCX incentives to LPs for our aleth and alcx markets, or LPing with alETH to help boost liquidity for the aleth options.”_  \n\nThis could set the stage for Premia to participate in new incentivized markets which could greatly increase and diversify the treasury with each new options market.  \n\n*The amount and duration of the deposit would ultimately be determined by the Premia team. (because they are giga🧠 and have gotten us this far)\n\n### Motivation\nThis proposal has the benefits of:\n1.\tSetting the standard for the level of commitment and good faith effort Premia has when integrating new options markets. \n2.\tIncentivizing utilization and better options pricing for the new markets.\n3.\tAdding PREMIA liquidity mining rewards to our own treasury. \n4.\tPotentially, earning ALCX incentivization rewards further diversifying our treasury. \n5.\tIndirectly investing a portion of our treasury as the collateral repays its own loan. This keeps the team from spending time running their own node. \n\n",

      "content": "**Simple Summary**\nNew markets on Premia allow protocol treasuries to earn yield on their capital while providing their communities with long-term accumulation and hedging opportunities to prevent downside token volatility.\n\nThe proposal below is to describe the first implementation of POOL and increase emissions to support four new options pools.\n\n**Abstract**\nThis proposal is to garner support for updating the emission rate of $PREMIA to provide incentive support to new partners of Premia.\n\nWith the completion of Premia's zero liquidity volatility surface architecture, it is now possible to create new, emerging options markets for any asset with a Chainlink price feed. Those markets can then sustain themselves on-chain driven by the capital efficiency provided by Premia’s market-driven options pricing. This is exciting for protocols looking to create capital-efficient opportunities for users within their ecosystem. \n\nProtocol Owned Options Liquidity (POOL), as a new liquidity primitive, allows DAOs and Protocols to bootstrap options/volatility markets for their native tokens. POOL inherently assists in the reduction of sell-side volatility in two ways:\n\n1. Providing a token-sink (the CALL pool), where LPs can deposit protocol tokens for yield and option purchasers can potentially acquire their token of choice at a discount to the spot market through capital-efficient options trades.\n\n2. Providing downside hedging opportunities (in the PUT pool), where LPs can deposit stablecoins for yield and option purchasers can hedge their downside exposure, without selling protocol tokens, in a capital-efficient manner.\n\nIn addition to reducing downside volatility, protocols that take advantage of POOL can earn an additional source of revenue for their treasury by activating idle native assets through a supporting options/volatility market on Premia. Protocols can earn fees in the form of premiums in the respective pool token, while also taking advantage of the $PREMIA rewards allocated to their respective pools from our Liquidity Mining program.\n\nThis provides many of the benefits of Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL), popularized by OHM, in a symbiotic manner with existing POL systems. Protocol Owned DEX Liquidity provides deeper liquidity to smooth volatility on the DEX sell-side, whereas Protocol Owned Options Liquidity helps significantly reduce sell-side volatility by providing both a token sink, where users can still obtain discounted tokens, and access a new market to hedge downside risks.\n\nWhen a protocol has both POL & POOL, they are able to deepen their DEX liquidity, while also providing a healthy risk market for users to earn an additional yield on the native token, as well as hedge protocol risk. Hence, there is a strong symbiosis between POL and POOL.\n\n**Specification and Implementation**\nAny asset with a Chainlink Price Feed can have a Zero Liquidity Market created. Data collection for surface creation takes approximately one week, after which, a Protocol/DAO needs only to agree to supply assets to a market for one to be supported.\n\nAsset markets and emission allocations must be approved by governance vote by the community via Snapshot prior to any live launch. As our first POOL partner, Premia is looking to support Alchemix and their alAssets. Two separate risk markets will be created:\n\n- ALCX [call] / DAI [put]\n- alETH [call] / alUSD [put]\n\nEmissions would be allocated for a minimum of 1 month, and a weekly review allows the community to shift those weights based on the pool’s utilization rates until a more permanent system (vePREMIA) is put in place.\n\nWe are excited about the addition of these token pairs to the platform. Alchemix is a staple in DeFi, pioneering their self-repaying loan mechanism. The addition of their protocol token market will add value for Premia users who would like exposure to more DeFi-native assets.\n\nAlchemix users will also be happy to find market-competitive yield on their alAssets (alETH and alUSD), while Premia users will be excited by potential new arbitrage opportunities this pool is likely to introduce as it moves toward market efficiency. Since each alETH is backed 1:1 by ETH and alUSD 1:1 by DAI, this is likely to create arbitrage opportunities between the existing ETH/DAI pool and the new alETH/alUSD pool.\n\n**Motivation**\nAs our first POOL partner, we'd like to welcome Alchemix warmly to the Premia family. There are many interesting ways that Premia and Alchemix could integrate with one another and we see this as the beginning of a fruitful partnership to begin unlocking the next generation of capital-efficient yields and options markets.\n\n**Clarification**\nProtocol emissions began in November at 0.5 PREMIA per block and were raised to 0.75 PREMIA per block in December with the deployment on Arbitrum, to incentivize the additional pools. The emission rate was then voted to be decreased back to 0.5 PREMIA per block and emissions to be weighted heavier on Arbitrum (0.125 to Mainnet, 0.375 to Arbitrum). \n\nThe current pool emission weight allocations per asset group are as follows (on both chains):\n\n- WETH: (50%) \n- WBTC: (33.33%)\n- LINK: (16.66%)\n\nWith the addition of the Alchemix pools on Mainnet, the proposed Mainnet allocations are as follows (Arbitrum weights will stay the same, as no pools are being added on Arbitrum):\n\n- WETH (35%)\n- WBTC (25%)\n- alETH (15%)\n- ALCX (15%)\n- LINK (10%)\n\nGiven the addition of these two new markets, per-block emissions can either maintain the current rate of 0.5 PREMIA per block or be raised to the previous amount of 0.75 PREMIA per block to provide additional support with minimal dilution.\n\n- Vote in Favor/In Support of: Keep 0.5 PREMIA per block (0.125 to Mainnet, 0.375 to Arbitrum)\n\n- Vote in Favor/In Support of: 0.75 PREMIA per block (0.375 to Mainnet, 0.375 to Arbitrum)\n\n- Vote Against/In Opposition of: adding emissions to the ALCX markets",

      "title": "Layer 1 Emissions Reduction",
      "content": "Summary:\nProgressively phase-down Layer 1 emissions.\n\nMotivation:\nThis proposal is in line with the proposal passed on November 29th (https://gov.premia.finance/#/proposal/0xcdbe55cd5875b4b0c91a5e69c73408f3acbc61cc2ce5fe45866d33a07fbba359) and the \"accelerate rewards phaseout\"  to occur after a review of data from both chains.  \n\nThe data has shown that activity has heavily favored Arbitrum over L1 (20 to 1), therefor it would be appropriate to phase out the accelerate rewards through L1 and to maintain emissions on Aribtrum.\n\nAbstract: \nCurrently, Premia's emissions are being evenly distributed between L1 and Arbitrum at a rate of 0.375 PREMIA per block (0.75 PREMIA per block total between both). L1 not only has half of the TVL, but close to 95% of all options have been purchased on Arbitrum. Prior to the Arbitrum deployment, the emission rate was set to 0.5 PREMIA per block to incentivize liquidity providers on the L1 system. The additional 0.25 PREMIA was temporary to stimulate L2 activity while not disincentivizing LP's on L1. The market has shown that Arbitrum is the preferred network (for the time being) to utilize the Premia platform and the incentives should align with the data.\n\nProposal:\nImmediately after a passing vote, reduce L1 emissions to 0.25 (a 33% reduction) PREMIA per block.\n\nThis emission rate would continue for 1 month before L1 emissions drop to 0.125.  At this point overall emissions will be back to the target emissions rate of 0.5 with 0.375 going to Arbitrum and 0.125 going to L1.\n\nNOTE: Rather than completely phasing out emissions on L1, we would maintain emissions, albeit at a reduced rate, to ensure there is liquidity for potential future partnerships that would require the L1 version of the platform.\n\nFor - Pass\nAgainst - Fail",

      "content": "On 30 Nov 2021 Premia launched on Arbitrum.  In order to reduce gas fees for users, Premia proposes to move 9.5% of current Mainnet Sushiswap liquidity to Arbitrum Sushiswap. \n\nObjective: Reduce gas fees on  swaps by up to [95%]\n\nAmount: 9.5% of current Mainnet Sushiswap liquidity or USD [1.3] million equivalent as of proposal date\n\nTiming: In the event of positive vote, liquidity will be re-allocated within 3 days and will remain on Arbitrum unless a new proposal arises.\n\nConsiderations & Risks:\n- The only difference between Mainnet Sushiswap and Arbitrum Sushiswap is the execution network (chain). It is the same protocol, and both chains settle transactions on ETH mainnet.\n- The main risks of this re-allocation (versus leaving the liquidity where it is currently) are unforeseen Arbitrum vulnerabilities.\n- Arbitrum appears to have very low incremental risks versus Mainnet, as it settles to ETH mainnet and has had no issues since launch, technical audits are satisfactory, and has comfortable liquidity growing to over $2.12 billion Total Value Locked.  More information is available on: https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-arbitrum/ and https://arbitrum.io/bridge-tutorial/\n- Accordingly, our view is any such unforeseen vulnerabilities appear to be low probability as of the proposal date.\n- The Impermanent Loss (IL) exposure, or the risk associated with potential losses due to asset price movements (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XJ1MSTEuU0), should not change, so there appears to be no material increased IL risk as a result of this liquidity reallocation.",

This swap would occur on the open market to capture the ETH/stETH premium. Lido is a reputable leader in staking Ethereum and is responsible for staking $6.8 billion. They have been utilized by several other protocols for treasury diversification as well. In addition, stETH tokens are highly liquid and would create a long-term, sustainable way to incentivize PREMIA staking.\n\nMuch like protocol fees are collected now, 80% of staking rewards from the stETH investment would be collected and converted to PREMIA and distributed to xPREMIA holders. The remaining 20% would remain in stETH.\n\nPremia is fortunate to not have a substantial amount of the treasury in PREMIA tokens. Starting with ETH allows for investment without the added complication of selling PREMIA tokens and negatively affecting the price. \n\n(This proposal is not meant to be inclusive of diversifying the treasury into backstop, development, or advertising funds. However, this proposal could act as a first step to passing a more comprehensive plan for treasury diversification and revenue management.) \n\nMotivation\n--\nInvesting a portion of the treasury to stETH has the benefits of:\n1.\tIncreasing PREMIA staking rewards until option purchase volume matures\n2.\tAdds support to grow the treasury outside of protocol fees\n3.\tEstablishes a revenue source to be governed and directed towards other initiatives in the future",

      "title": "Implement POL mining via Olympus Pro",
      "content": "**Summary**\nImplement protocol-owned liquidity mining through Olympus DAO’s bond program, Olympus Pro.\n\n**Motivation:**\nIncentivizing liquidity provisioning is a balancing act for protocols seeking to distribute their native token, between high inflation and low liquidity depth. The re-addition of liquidity mining incentives will be an excellent tool to decentralize the supply of PREMIA to community members providing liquidity to the options pools. However, the emissions rate may cause supply dilution as liquidity providers compound their rewards. By implementing an Olympus Pro bond program for PREMIA-ETH liquidity, Premia can distribute its native tokens to loyal protocol users, while accumulating meaningful liquidity for the protocol.\n\n**Abstract:**\nCurrently, PREMIA has approximately $12 million in liquidity on Sushiswap in the PREMIA-ETH pool and could benefit greatly from having deeper liquidity.\nThe proposed bond program would exchange PREMIA at a discount in return for PREMIA/ETH LP tokens through the Olympus Pro protocol. Current liquidity mining programs reward liquidity providers with tokens like PREMIA in exchange for temporary liquidity, which exposes those providers to impermanent loss from fluctuations in the underlying assets. Bonds allow active users to stack PREMIA tokens at a discount while removing the exposure to IL. The discount rate on bonds is achieved by a novel pricing mechanism that allows the market to set the discount. Essentially, bond prices are decreased until a bond is purchased, which then pushes up the price of the next bond. For reference, here is the average discount of Olympus’ bonds with their extremely high APY: https://dune.xyz/queries/74112/147618\n\n**Olympus Pro**\nOlympus is offering to provide its expertise in bond contract management to support other protocols interested in owning their own liquidity. This will include providing the UI for bonds and maintaining bond control variables to balance emissions with liquidity accumulation. In exchange for the implementation and community engagement, Olympus would take a fee on all PREMIA bonds sold. Olympus will use the PREMIA earned as backing for the intrinsic value of OHM, which would act as a supply sink for PREMIA.\n\n**Proposed Bond Program:**\nPREMIA bonds would be offered with a week-long vesting period, which helps prevent immediate price impact from discounted tokens. This aligns the goals of the protocol with those of bond participants. Typically, higher bond volume is seen when users expect the price of the token to increase during the vesting period.\n\n**Proposal**\nGauge community support for the allocation of $250k worth of Premia towards one month of optional bonds via Olympus Pro, beginning November 8th. If the program is a success and the community would like to continue the bonding liquidity program past the ending of this, a new proposal would be published for voting.\n\n**Success criteria**\n- Average discount rate < 8% on bonded PREMIA\n- Minimal impact on PREMIA price\n\n**Benefits**\n- Permanent liquidity source\n- Increased treasury value from liquidity that also earns trading fees\n- Exposure to paired asset in liquidity pool (ETH)\n- Premia can stake its LP tokens to provide additional runway for incentive programs\n\n**Risks**\n- Additional PREMIA emissions via bonds will increase supply dilution.\n\n",

The SM incentive rate will be decided by the Premia team in conjunction with the community to find the appropriate balance of incentives to the risk being taken.  The emission rate can be adjusted via governance vote.  To prevent gaming of the SM a cooldown of 7 days will be placed on unstaked tokens.\n\nThe specific technical implementation details of the SM will be decided by the team.

This program incentivizes Nexus Mutual stakers (aka risk assessors) to stake their NXM in Premia's risk pool which then allows Premia users to take out cover for their funds deposited into Premia.  This cover protects the user from a number of scenario's that would cause a loss of funds such as exploits and smart contract failure.\n\nDue to the increased risk of newly launched protocols it is often difficult to get Nexus Mutual risk assessors to stake their capital in these risk pools.  Shield mining was created as a way for protocols to provide additional incentivizes to risk assessors to compensate the additional risk they are taking on.  These incentives attract risk assessor capital and helps to more quickly bootstrap the risk pool.  The way Nexus cover pricing works is the more NXM that is staked in a pool the cheaper it is for users to take out cover with the cheapest possible premium being 2.6% annually.\n\nThe details of Premia's shield mining program is purposefully omitted from this proposal to allow the Premia team to work with Nexus Mutual to decide what is the most optimal emissions rate, emissions duration, etc.\n\n\nAbout Nexus Mutual\n-\n- Nexus Mutual's FAQ https://nexusmutual.gitbook.io/docs/welcome/faq\n- More information on Nexus Mutual shield mining https://medium.com/nexus-mutual/shield-mining-is-here-85067a30ab06\n- Nexus Mutual's Discord https://t.co/vttFaczvOJ?amp=1\n\n\nMotivation\n-\nGiven the many risks that exist in DeFi, this proposal would give users the option to take out cover for the funds they have deposited in the platform.

The effects as outlined in the previous community vote are seen as unfavorable, and that those tokens can be utilized elsewhere.\n ##\nSpecification and Implementation:\nFollowing the Bonding Curve Community Vote (\"Preliminary Vote\" IPFS: Qmf9B7fWv5UKNDVk1m8VZcWeVNmwkqVWspsPGXSBMu1yxb) from April 2021, the following plan is proposed to be executed:\n\n1.    At conclusion of this Bonding Curve Disassembly Core Vote (a \"Core Vote\") ending in 5 days, to continue to execute the 7 day time-locked transaction (submitted 04 September 2021) to dismantle the bonding curve, and move those corresponding 25 million Premia Tokens to the 3 day \"time-locked contract\" known as the \"Premia: Dev Fund\" (Contract Address: 0xE43147dAa592C3f88402C6E2b932DB9d97bc1C7f).\n\n2.    These 25 million Premia Tokens will be utilized for protocol ecosystem development in the coming years including allocations but not limited to; adding more core contributors to the project, incentivizing new products, utilizing for strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or service contracts, long term marketing strategies, potential use with a Safety Module like mechanism, etc. at the discretion of Premian Republic, unless otherwise struck down by Protocol Governance (known as the \"Premian Assembly\") or via a Premia DAO vote once transitioned via a formalized path.\n ##\nMotivation:  The benefits of dismantling are well known to the community, and this Core Vote proposal is to define the next steps to achieve that desired outcome.\n ##\nClarification: \nVote For/In Support of: The above outlined steps will be implemented\n\nVote Against/In Opposition of: The above outlined steps will be ignored and the 7 day time-locked transaction to dismantle the bonding curve will be cancelled\n##\nFurther Reference can be found at [docs.premia.finance](https://docs.premia.finance)",

      "content": "After careful consideration and feedback from the community, The Premian Republic proposes that the trading competition be extended by 10 days. With just over 1 week left of the competition, there are quite a few new features recently requested that have been/are being added in which the team feels would benefit participants greatly by extending the 20 day competition by 10 days, making it a full 30 day competition.\n\nSome of the benefits:\n- Batch reassignment: LP's previously could not reassign their options positions and this feature is now available.\n- Early LP's got rekt from instant profit trades: LP's who incurred losses will be reimbursed the capital lost from the instant profit trades.\n- Leaderboard: Currently, there's been no way to know who or what traders are up against. This will give participants ~2 full weeks of competitive trading.\n- 20 days seems short: A full 30 days to compete for those that came day 1 would be beneficial coupled with the above bullet points, and from feedback gathered from community members, new participants wouldn't mind a few extra days either.\n\nUnderstandably there is a large prize pool up for winning, but after serious consideration, the team believes this proposal should be considered by the community as a whole, and would greatly benefit both early and late participants to the competition.",

      "content": "Currently 100% of fees generated by the protocol are sent to the Premian Development Fund to fund the future growth and development of the platform. The community proposes to change the allocation of protocol fees to:\n\n>80% to Premia Staking Users\n>20% to the Premian Development Fund\n\nThe Premian Development Fund will continue to utilize these fees to provide option liquidity to the platform, pay cross protocol fees (ex: Chainlink Oracle fees, KP3R Jobs, etc), Invest in Partnerships, Marketing, Traditional Business Expenses, Hedge Risk, etc.\n\nAs platform utilization increases, the community will look to optimize this allocation in the future.\n",
