      "content": "The council proposes spinning off the fund and governance aspects of Fat Cats from the NFT into an ERC-20 token:\n\nThe ERC-20 token would represent the fund and governance, serving as a pro-rata share and vote. All existing bylaws, including our council structure and mandates, would be inherited.\n\nThe Fat Cats NFT would become a wholly owned asset of the ERC-20 token. The NFT will act as an entry pass to our token-gated community offering access to research, education, opportunities and giveaways. We plan to pivot as the space evolves so as to remain relevant and valuable to our holders.\n\nIf the vote passes, a token will be created and airdropped in the near future. To avoid speculation, a snapshot was taken at 9:11 pm UTC / 5:11 pm ET\n\nTo read more about our plans and thinking, please see our most recent newsletter.  There is also a channel in the Discord called #new-token where you can ask questions.\n\nWhile we see no reason for the SEC or any similar organization to assert authority over us, as we are certainly not a security, the council remains committed to good governance and best practices. We acknowledge that regulatory clarity is currently opaque, and we are committed to updating you all and pivoting together should the need arise.",

Many of our members have rightfully said that our investment strategy mandates were not broad enough and often caused us to miss incredible opportunities. In addition the market has changed drastically and we need to be able to pivot quickly to profitable ventures such as issuing collateralized loans or getting access to token presales.\n\nWe believe the council has shown an excellent governance track record, work well together and have a strong understanding of risk management. Our original policies served us well and protected the DAOs capital. However, they also caused us to miss great opportunities. Should the DAO approve this mandate the council will begin operating in a way that resembles a hedge fund whereby the council chair will act in a way that resembles a fund manager, executing the trades unless this function gets delegated to another councilor and the remaining councilors will act as the general advisory and oversight committee",

Given recent SEC legal action against prominent exchanges and their deeming a number of crypto currencies to be securities, we wish to formally reiterate that the members of this DAO have always understood that we are not a security. We have always been very conservative with our understanding of the Howey Test and shown our intent to be in compliance by avoiding such things as creating staking programs. That said we wish to show good faith and our honorable intent by clarifying two further matters.\n\nJunior Fat Cats, at such time as we choose to launch them, will be claimable with no time limit on a 1:1 basis for every Fat Cat Genesis. No additional Juniors will be sold to the public.\n\nThis DAO will not bring forward votes to distribute profits until such time as we get more legal clarity about security law as it relates to NFTs. We make it absolutely clear that since our inception we have never guaranteed distributions, done any distributions nor has a vote ever been put forward to request distributions. There have however, been discussions within the community about the possibility of future distributions and so the DAO wishes to now bring clarity on this matter.\n\nThe council requests to be granted a discretionary mandate to be able to create an arbitration strategy for the Fat Cats collection whereby we use some of our monthly trading profits to purchase Fat Cats on marketplaces, should we see them undervalued relative to our collective holdings. Similarly should be see deviations to the upside we may choose to sell some and/or take collateralized loans against them. A dedicated council managed wallet that only holds Fat Cats and the allocated funds will be created so as to ensure total transparency.",

      "title": "New Allocation Proposal",
      "content": "When we initially founded Fat Cats we spoke in terms of Big Caps, Mid Caps & small caps, however, we minted into the beginning of a bear market and there was major concern that many smaller projects might go bankrupt, rug or just not be able to fulfill promises and fall drastically in price. That has been true for the most part and our conservative approach protected us. \n\nThat said the market has since consolidated making it a lot clearer who is still building and has potential. Furthermore our research department is working hard to turn out quality reports empowering an ever more experienced council and community to judge projects viability. \n\nIn addition we have seen tremendous volatility in the price of Ethereum & Bitcoin and considering our holdings are all in Ethereum it makes sense for us to hedge our core 'currency' and the global economy. \n\nWe currently have two asset that have received a large allocation of our capital, our ape and our punk. The majority of holders and the council agree our Cryptopunk should not be sold as it acts as an aggregate of the well being of all NFTs, is a very desirable collectors items as the premier Archeological NFT and does not need utility to succeed. In addition there is no derivative item of Cryptopunks. Our Bored Ape on the other hand can be sold to free up liquidity and we can still have exposure to the Yuga ecosystem via Mutant Apes of which we have had much success trading and dogs. Both of which have much higher volume as they act as a cheaper entry point and are thus easier to also arbitrage. The goal would be to eventually buy back a Bored Ape as our funds grow from our trading activities but right now locking up that much of our funds stops us from being able to explore other opportunities. \n\nThe council proposes that we sell our Bored Ape and allocate the funds accordingly:\n\n1) Blue Chip Trader Fund (known currently as the Trader wallet & headed by Dylan) would be seeded with 9 more ETH in addition to the current ETH & 5 Mutants (bringing it to approximately 100 ETH). This fund will focus on trading and hodling the projects the council deems to be blue chips which are currently Yuga assets, Azuki Assets & RTFKT assets. What is key about this fund is that with all three of these projects we are alright getting theoretically 'stuck' with their items as we believe in their long-term potential. The DAO would need to grant the Council the discretion to upgrade and downgrade projects accordingly. \n \n2) Emerging Blue Chip Trader Fund which will be headed by Bela and seeded with 20 ETH. Emerging Blue Chips are those that the Council deem to have high potential however we consider them not yet of Blue Chip status and as such we would prefer to just trade them when we see volume and price movement opportunities. Currently Proof ecosystem, Doodles, Chimpers & Pudgy Penguins as well as Veefrens ecosystem and Reddit Genesis Avatars are on the Council's shortlist. This group is more dynamic and the DAO would need to grant the Council the discretion to upgrade and downgrade projects accordingly. \n\n3) Currency hedge-fund which will be headed by Parker and seeded with 20 ETH in order to hold a basket of Bitcoin, USDC & Ethereum with price movement trading done primarily with Ethereum. The DAO would need to grant the council the discretion to upgrade and downgrade a few coins that often overlap our ecosystems namely $APE & $MATIC.\n\n4) Gold hedge-fund which will be headed by Nadia and seeded with 10 ETH in order to trade gold movements. Gold traditionally tends to be a very good hedge against recessions as people rely on it as a store of wealth when stocks and the like are in flux. It also tends to get a lot of volume during bear markets allowing us to potentially profit off of swings. \n\nThe remaining funds will be stored in our vault as our reserve and it is proposed that with all four funds, 50% of every profitable trade be sent back to the vault so that we can show a track record and keep growing our reserve to eventually buy back a Bored Ape or some other valuable long-term hold and/or distribute funds to holders should they desire. The remaining profit will be used to keep compounding growth.",

      "title": "Open our Discord to the public",
      "content": "When we first opened the Fat Cats Discord it was made available to the public, however it was during a bull period when many new people were being onboarded into the space. Many of them lacked even basic Web3 knowledge and we were concerned that should they just hop into the Discord without an invite from one of the groups we had given whitelist spots too or someone on the Fat Cats whitelist (that could chaperone them) they would lower the quality of the conversation and/or get rekt or overwhelmed by the amount of information available. In addition Discord was going through a period of mass scams. \n\nAs the space consolidates and quietens some both of these concerns are no longer as relevant. Most people still looking to join Discord communities come fairly well informed and are genuinely interested in finding active groups who are still building and learning together. In addition most of our members are quite informed about staying safe and the security systems available to us have improved (both via Wicks, verification systems & Discord itself). \n\nIt has been a long time since we discussed some of our founding principals, however one of the core ones was that our Discord being locked was not done to be snobbish but rather to ensure the quality of user. We have always maintained the Fat Cats Ally role for this reason. In addition unlike alpha groups who justify the price of their subscription or NFT based on the quality of alpha 'hidden' inside as well as the access to scarce whitelist spots we have always made it clear that our core unique offering for Fat Cats holders was the pro-rata share of the DAO both in holdings and governance. In addition to that we of course use our network to ensure excellent whitelist spots, partnerships and discounts whenever possible and that has never been made available to non holders with the exception of Goblincatz which get a small catnip stipend and single raffle entry in order to be the 'gateway drug' to our ecosystem (as a side note our smaller Discord has often caused prejudice against us when asking for whitelist allocations as we were perceived by some of the hype projects as not being that important).\n\nWe are in a period of great upheaval in the space. The constants for almost a year; such as marketplaces & royalties are in flux. Where people are spending their time is changing drastically as well. Many Discord's are not being well maintained by teams and in some cases are utterly dead. That is not the case for us at all. Sure things are quieter for us as well but on the whole our Discord has remained truly one of the best places to pop into any time of the day; quality conversation, vibrant Cafe chats, valuable alpha and more are handed out like candy and this is truly special. I mentioned in April already that social capital (genuine engagement of people) was going to be the most valuable commodity in this space because the rapid growth of community Discord's vying for people's attention was not sustainable. People do not check into 200 Discords a day, the number is closer to 3-5. I was speaking to the team of one of the big marketplaces yesterday and they mentioned a similar sentiment, that marketplaces are understanding this as well, i.e. if you can capture engagement and volume you can monetize that later with advertising or the like even if marketplace fees disappear.\n\nFat Cats DAO's vision is becoming clearer each day we are building the premier blue chip NFT collectors club and an umbrella group for specialized sub-DAOs be it cryptocurrency or fine-art. This is our core offering and a tangible 'product' that we can offer to others. In addition we have worked hard to turn our Discord into a major business hub & think tank where people can learn, share research & more. For us to grow exponentially with time we need to both make excellent financial choices and court new members that align with our vision. This will naturally lead to a supply and demand situation thus leading to capital gains and/or distributions for our Genesis holders and allow us to raise funds for our sub-DAOs (which of course our Fat Cats holders will have a piece of automatically via holding a Fat Cat). \n\nAnd so the council proposes to open up our Discord again to the greater Web3 space. We can of course change this if need be in the future however, now seems like an incredible opportunity for us to solidify our long-term importance in the space. We are all about investing in other projects, free-speech, open discussion about all projects and fostering a spirit of partnership and cooperation; just look at our patron program. As Esquibar put it, our general chat can become a central business hub where all are welcome. Our holders chats can maintain the more intimate & personal aspect that so many of you have come to love as well and allow for deeper conversations. In addition we will offer like minded communities that might be struggling to maintain a Discord, due to a smaller holder base, shrinking teams or financial cut backs to move into ours (it is easy for us to token gate a couple of channels for their holders as well).\n\nThough giving away certain things for free sometimes seems counter-intuitive, in this case it seems absolutely in our best interest. So many who have had the privilege of being part of our Discord have mentioned how special it is. Let's build on that and let's court all the thinkers, innovators, traders & investors still active in the space to our hub and enrich each other.\n\nIf you feel this will indeed benefit us and it makes sense please vote yes to opening our Discord. If you would prefer to maintain a closed more exclusive invite only Discord vote no & if you are neutral on the matter vote abstain. ",

      "title": "Reduce Royalties to 2.5%",
      "content": "The royalties discussion has been going on for quite some time with many strong opinions. What is clear from Fat Cats holders is that philosophically most of us think royalties should exist and that since all royalties go towards the DAO treasury we are a unique situation. That said the winds of change are blowing fast and optional royalties are becoming the marketplace norm.  The recent MagicEden & Blur announcement & opening respectively has solidified the situation for now. \n\nTo that end the council is united in its feeling that we should lower our royalty to 2.5% for three core reasons. Firstly though Fat Cats is a collectors club we have always tried to take the best practices from Web2 and in particular the financial industry. Though royalties as high as 10% are normal in Web3 they are certainly not common in the fund management space, defi or fintech. This will send a strong long-term message about what we are aiming to build and align ourselves with the greater financial world.\n\nSecondly we wish to  remove barriers of entry for as many people as possible that might want to give Fat Cats a try and who want to be honorable when they buying into our ecosystem. I.e. a person purchasing for 0.1 eth who knows that they can recoup close to that amount should they desire to sell soon after buying is more likely to purchase and test it out.\n\nLastly we wish to send a strong message that although we will work hard to be a self sustaining ecosystem that profits from our investment and arbitrage choices we do strongly support royalties and take all revenue streams seriously. At our current volume 2.5% royalties would still amount to 0.2-0.3 ETH range and during periods of higher volume or when we have project releases such as Junior Fat Cats we could expect solid revenue opportunities.\n\nit is important to note that we will likely revisit this question a few times in the future. The beauty of our DAO is that very little is cast in stone and we can always vote in the future to increase or decrease. In addition as we explore the creation of Sub DAOs focused on other asset classes such as crypto currency hedge DAO we will have the opportunity to set royalties for each of those accordingly.",

We also note that despite our aim to invest long-term we will not shy away from selling our holdings should Micro or Macro Economic factors indicate we should. \n\nThe remaining funds would be for our cash reserves (with the aim to always have at least six months of expenditures in reserve), initiatives such as our loan pool, our accelerator program & arbitrage opportunities, such as whitelist flips or taking short-term positions in such projects as Doodles when we see high volume opportunities. \n \n\n",

      "title": "Nouns Purchase Proposal",
      "content": "The proposal is put forward that we acquire a Nouns NFT in the 70-80 ETH range.\n\nNouns are one of the most unusual and unique projects. https://nouns.wtf/\n\nFirstly it has a prolific bunch of founders (including Gremplin of Cryptotoadz and Chimpers founder), artists and council members (It is a DAO after all). \n\nSecondly instead of minting 10K in one go they mint one each day forever and do so via a public auction. We have it on good authority from SharkDAO (one of the bigger holders) and Giancarlo that the DAO can vote at any time to stop supply meaning they might end up with vastly less than 10K. As it is it would take over 27 years for them to mint 10k! Each Noun acts like a Fat Cat in that it is a pro-rata vote and share of the DAO and so if the DAO were to liquidate tomorrow the pay out would be 74 ETH per noun (The treasury currently holds 26097 ETH). As a side note Giancarlo considers Nouns to be one of the top three NFT pfp collections (the other two being Cryptopunks & BAYC.)\n\nThirdly, their compensation structure is fascinating! The team get paid with every 10th Noun which gets sent to their group wallet thus incentivizing them to continue to build the brand along with the holders & council. The council at this time are not compensated. \n\nNext is the fact that NounDAO is the OG of CC0 and their glasses are so iconic that they show up regularly in other collections. Because of their CC0 status a number of derivatives have already been created which has both strengthened the core brand (and regularly caused their floor to be propped up - we know this well in the NFT space that derivatives tend to drastically help the OG collection) and got them compensation in some cases (Little Nouns is a derivative project with a floor of 0.45 eth that mints a noun every 15 minutes and the 11 one goes to Nouns vault every time). There are not many quality CC0s yet and of the CC0s only Noun really seems to be constantly building and doing (well other than Fat Cats of course).\n\nLastly Nouns has been active for nearly a year and does not seem to be slowing down. You can see all of their recent votes here https://nouns.wtf/vote. It should be noted that most of their votes that require funds have been focused around branding and charity vs asset acquisition like in the case of Fat Cats. This both shows their interest is heavily on building out their ecosystem and brand but also might make the project less appealing to some in Fat Cats who are heavily income or compounded growth focused. That said, having looked into the matter a bit it seems the holders and council are just being patient and avoiding making gimmick investments until we see more actual NFT utility. While they wait their focus on brand building and exposing the world to NFT art has been admirable and their floor price reflects it as does the very serious amount of hodler whales. If this proposal passes I also propose that we make an effort to get involved in their Discord and push to get on their board so that we can take an active role in their direction.\n\nPlease note as we are still working to get a UI for our website sorted so that you can all easily see the state of our holdings our current core holdings are. Should we proceed with this purchase we will safely have operational funds for six months and liquidity to aggressively pursue quality incubator projects, high quality flips and arbitrage positions, however we will not be able to pursue much else until our capital then increases again. \n\nApproximately 94-96 ETH (with the most recent royalties) so assuming we do purchase a Noun for 80 ETH the remainder would be 14-16 ETH.\n6 months funds held in USDC to pay for the council, basic expenses and get our Shopify store running.\n5.5 WETH in our loan liquidity pool. \n\n1 x BAYC\n1 x MAYC\n1 x Cryptopunks\n1 x Otherdeed\n6 x Bubbleworlds \n1 x TCG world gold (gifted)\n1 x Plug pass (gifted)\n1 x Freshdrops (gifted)\n3 x Engima Economy (gifted)\n1 x Recon Rams (gifted)\n1 x Metatriads (gifted)\n1 x Salty Pirates (gifted)\n",

      "title": "Fat Cats CC0 Revote",
      "content": "The question of IP rights has become a big one. Currently there are three camps:\n\nFully owned by the team: This is how Cryptopunks initially was setup ie the team owned all the IP rights.\nShared with the holders: This is the BAYC model and the one we currently use in Fat Cats ie the Team/DAO owns the overall IP rights and the DAO shares those rights with you the individual holder of the NFT\nCollective Commons (CC) which requires attribution & (CC0) which does not require attribution: This is where the IP rights are given over to the greater Web3 community at large. Good examples of this are Cryptoadz, Tubby Cats, NounDAO & GoblinTown.This means that we are essentially allowing any and all people to use the art style of Fat Cats as well as specific Fat Cats in any derivative or form they so wish. \n\nThis vote is on whether we should go CCO or not. It is worth noting that we will always encourage attribution but as with anything you officially demand, it requires enforcement would be needed and it seems that in the NFT space CCO has won over CC. This is likely for pragmatic reasons. In addition the name Fat Cats and our logo are not being made CC0. Though anyone could do a parody derivative of our logo (look at Goblincatz). Those wanting our official endorsement will need to ask us for the use of our name and logo.\n\nI have been looking into the concept of CC0 for many months and the recent resurgence of CC0 in the form of Goblintown, as well as the very pragmatic issue of us discovering post mint barriers of entry when trying to get Fat Cats integrated into different games and collections has pushed me strongly towards the CC0 camp. To be clear both IP rights and CC0 have their place. It  really depends on what the project's goals are. In the case of something like My Pet Hooligan or Cool Cats where the express goal is to create games, tv shows and other media it makes a lot of sense for them to want to hold on tightly to the IP rights.\n\nHowever in the case of Fat Cats, as counter intuitive as CC0 seems at first, it actually makes a ton of sense and will likely propel our integration forward in a big way way. Here are the main reasons why.\n\nThe whole reason we made profile pictures and not a pass token like Adidas was because we understood that having pfps granted us the opportunity to weaponize our community into brand ambassadors and keep our name in the news cycle as much as possible. In other words our value proposition is our Fund & business club/think tank, our art, as fabulous as it is, is a means to an end not an end unto itself. So giving the greater Web3 community the freedom to play with our art, make derivatives and so on greatly increases our chance of being noticed and remembered. There is also a strong argument to be made that our art is somewhat CCO already because we created a parody of Disney art and not a 'unique' art style.\n\nWeb3 is about connecting people. There is a reason that CCO and free mints often do very well. The OGs and whales of crypto consider this to be the ultimate expression of the ideals of Web3. It continues the philosophy of Satoshi Nakamoto and is seen as very brave and self assured, i.e. we are telling Web3 that we have enough value to give to our holders that we do not have to heavily police our IP. In addition many people just do not understand basic IP rights and so whenever in doubt they tend to just shy away and move on. How many amateur artists have not posted a Tweet of their sketch or NFT fan art out of concern for legal action? Let us not also forget that there are a number of very influential libertarians in the space that have a very strong view when it comes to art and intellectual property, to them art is primarily a commodity product because there are tons of super talented artists who will create superb work for a low price and so the value of the art lies in the brand or utility built around the art not the art itself intrinsically. One does not pay a massive premium on a Rolex because it tells superior time but because it is a massive symbol of prosperity, wealth and so on. The fact it is, a quality timepiece is expected.\n\nPolicing IP is extremely difficult and expensive. In addition to the perception issue the fact that Web3 is still very anonymous means that in practice it is very difficult to police IP rights and when communities like Cryptopunks have tried to and the Web3 community at large were very upset at them. This is also important in regards to OpenSea who feel the need to police first and ask questions later. I would hate for OpenSea to just remove a Fat Cats derivative because some zealous holder filed a DMCA. What a lost opportunity for publicity! If we clearly state we are CC0, Opensea will not do so.\n\nGetting onboarded into other collections, games and metaverse platforms is extremely important to us because if people regularly bump into Fat Cats all over the place they will of course remember us or ask who the fuck are Fat Cats. I only found out post Fat Cats mint that the only people who do actually take IP very seriously are the games like the Arcade and merchandize manufacturers. They want the council to sign a bunch of paperwork before they proceed. However, if we were CCO they would be able to just make mockups, incorporate us and ask questions later. Getting 1 of 1s in other collections is turning out to be extremely valuable press for us as we always need a good excuse to Tweet! So why not remove the barriers. I have it on good authority that Cryptoadz did not explicitly give YugaLabs permission to onboard them into the Otherside advert. To be clear Fat Cats retained the rights to use everyone's Cats anyway in things like games or the like so as to not handy cap the entire Fat Cats community with the need for tons of paperwork every time we wanted to use a specific Cat in a game. However, the overly careful entertainment providers still seem to have lawyers driving them nuts.\n\nYour NFT's value does not decrease in value for the same reason that right click save has not decreased the value of NFTs. The reality is that when images become famous they get more and more exposure and more and more hardcore collectors want the flex of owning the real deal. The fact that the IP rights are public domain does not change the fact that if you hold Fat Cat x you are still the legitimate owner. Just look at the Mona Lisa she gets free press coverage all day every day and it has pushed up her value considerably over the years in the fine arts world. Also if you want NFT examples have a look at Cryptoadz & NounDAO their rarer ones sell at considerable premiums. Also I am going to say it, most of you are not likely to monetize your specific Fat Cat and if you are exclusive IP rights vs the collective IP does not change that you are the specific holder on the blockchain. And for those of you creating merchandise for sale, being CC0 will not mean you can't have the DAO's official endorsement so that you can use the logos and attract our holders.\n\nOfficial derivatives and collaborations still carry tremendous weight! Just because we go CCO does not mean that, as we grow in size and influence, projects will not reach out for official endorsements and the blessing from us to be an official derivative or go through our incubator program. People bang down the door of Cryptoadz and now GoblinTown for said endorsement every day. Goblincatz proved this. It is CC0 and yet Fat Cats official endorsement helped us sell out and garner trust in our contract.\n\nThe strongest argument against CC0 is that if a holder of Fat Cats had planned to go and create a game, movie or the like with a Fat Cats character(s) that they own, then assuming they intended to make the brand huge, they would not be able to stop eg: Aliexpress from making posters of their NFT and selling them (not that it is particularly easy now). The reality is though that almost no individuals have monetized their specific NFTs into big brands. The most notable examples are the Jenkins the Butler NFT & The Kingship band. It does seem that those who can build in Web3 tend to just form their own project and brand rather than try and monetize a few NFTs they own the rights to.\n\nThat said the DAO can certainly acquire assets from valuable brands like BAYC and monetize them as we see fit; be it merchandize or more. In addition, just because we are making Fat Cats CC0, in order to propel ourselves forward quickly, does not mean that once we are bigger we cannot choose to incubate or create a project that is intended to have valuable IP.\n\nIn short I am glad we started with IP rights so that we could study the space more together and weigh up the pros and cons. I think given our goals and agenda it makes perfect sense for us to go CC0 and to use the Goblintown moment to spread the word and put even more eyes on us.\n\nIf I have learned anything from my last year in the NFT space it is that the more I give the more I get. If we keep focusing on attracting the right people, creating genuine value for our holders and creating opportunities for them day in and day out (whether it be with WL spots, drops, networking or job creation) then we will keep winning and build one of the most powerful community whales in the space.\n\nPS: we recorded an AMA on this topic you can check it out in Podcast recordings.",

      "title": "Otherdeed Metaverse Embassy vote",
      "content": "Establishing ourselves in as many Metaverse platforms as possible has always been a core tenant of Fat Cats. We can debate endlessly on whether Metaverses are a good investment financially speaking however there is little doubt that socially speaking they are essentially the Web3 public square. Just like we use Twitter to broadcast our message and grow our brand so to us being able to integrate Fat Cats into as many platforms as possible will keep eyes constantly on us.\n\nWe lucked out very early on with our partnerships as many of them afforded us the ability to get Embassies as gifts; like in the case of TCG World who donated a gold farm to the DAO, through alliances like in the case with Cosa Nostra who will give us access to their land in Mobland or via bulk pricing discussions with groups like Council of Kings who will be able to give us embassies in prime locations for an affordable rent price. We also as tomorrow's announcement will show; were able to get a massive and stunning Embassy in NFT Worlds from Meets Meta!\n\nThis leaves one notable exception, The Otherside. Yuga Labs is the king maker in the NFT Space and if their track record is anything to go by, Otherside will likely be done to a high standard and also will likely attract a large number of NFT holders and communities to it. Critical mass of active users is vital for social Metaverse platforms. In addition to that Yuga Labs have pretty much always tied their perks to their apes and so with so much chatter about Bored Ape staking going on it makes sense for us to consider the fact we already own a BAYC & MAYC. \n\nThe price of Otherside deeds has come right down; especially the non floor ones. This is important to us as the land is set up in five segments (rings as shown on the images attached to the post). Dylan was able to secure number #1118 Biogenic Swamp for 5.25 ETH (a bit less than two times the floor ones). #1118 as the image shows is very close to the central hub where the actual Bored Ape Yacht Club resides. Due to the timely nature of buying such a cool one at a good price (most others that close are north of 7 ETH), Dylan fronted the funds and should the DAO vote no to purchase the land he is happy to keep it for himself. Having our embassy in a Bored Ape designed land so close to the center is bound to serve our branding goals. The parcel also has a nice amount of resources relative to its price and location.\n\nIt is worth noting that this fund has always favored blue chip NFT brands over games and metaverse platforms. Games because we have a sister DAO focused on that, Crown Capital and Metaverse platforms because we consider them to be potentially high reward but also higher risk as there is a lot of competition among providers for the same modest group of users aka the NFT & Web3 communities.\n\nSome have expressed their desire to wait given market conditions. Some are of the stance that lands this close to the Bored Ape Yacht Club center have usually been in the 15-20 ETH range and given how much ETH is down and the inverse relationship at times between NFTs & ETH that now is the right time to grab it. \n\nIn addition location matters in MMORPGs and places like Second Life. Central hubs are where all the foot traffic is and we can expect a lot of exposure for our brand based on our location.\n\n(Please see the notice for the attached images) ",

The fact that the IP rights are public domain does not change the fact that if you hold Fat Cat x you are still the legitimate owner. Just look at the Mona Lisa she gets free press coverage all day every day and it has pushed up her value considerably over the years in the fine arts world. Also if you want NFT examples have a look at Cryptoadz & NounDAO their rarer ones sell at considerable premiums. Also I am going to say it, most of you are not likely to drastically monetize your specific Fat Cat with tons of merchandize and if you are you still likely will not care if you have the exclusive IP rights vs the collective IP rights when you can still clearly show that you are the specific holder on the blockchain. And for those of you creating merchandize for sale on places like Etsy being CCO will also allow you to use our official logos, slogans and so on.\n\n6) Official derivatives and collaborations still carry tremendous weight! Just because we go CCO does not mean that, as we grow in size and influence, projects will not reach out for official endorsements and the blessing from us to be an official derivative or go through our incubator program. People bang down the door of Cryptoadz and now Goblin Town for said endorsement every day. We are starting GoblinCatz and when it comes close to mint the fact that it is is our team doing it carries significant weight with our network as we have already proven our integrity. \n\nIn short I am glad we started with IP rights so that I could study the space more and weigh up the pros and cons. I think given our goals and agenda it makes perfect sense for us to go CCO and to use the Goblin Town moment to spread the word and put even more eyes on us. \n\nIf I have learned anything from my last year in the NFT space it is that the more I give the more I get. If we keep focusing on attracting the right people, creating genuine value for our holders and creating opportunities for them day in and day out (whether it be with WL spots, drops, networking or job creation) then we will keep winning and build one of the most powerful community whales in the space.\n\nFat Cats Richer Together!",

We will likely purchase a number of these at a time eg 10 of a project and so we will be able to potentially sell some to lock in profit and hold some as these projects mature.\n\nSMALL CAP: 1-5%\n• Definition: projects that have not yet minted and show high potential either as long term holds or as arbitrage situations such as PXN.\n• Liquidity preference: monitor projects closely and be nimble x2\n(more consideration into flipping projects where we don’t have\ndeep understanding/faith in team post-mint). We can always purchase back later should they start to prove themselves.\n\nINCUBATOR: 5%\n• Definition: incubation projects (idea, pre-launch, post-launch)\n• Expect very few incubation projects to need major investment; focus\nis more on resources and network\n\nCASH: 1-12%\n• USDC + ETH + DAI + Loans/LP + Other Ventures. We will be able to earn passive income as well and mitigate against impermanent loss via Bancor.\n    \n(note that actual allocation is subject to change, market events,\netc.):\n",

      "content": "It is proposed that Fat Cats officially endorse the derivative being created by one of our mentors, CalebNachtigall. \n\nThe project will be having fun with the Goblin Town meta (see sample below). It will be an cc0 arts (collective commons IP rights) & vibe project with no planned utility other than to allow the holders access to our server. The DAO can vote to implement utility at any time should we so desire.\n\nIt will be a free mint. The royalties will be set initially at 2.5% and 50% will go to the DAO treasury and 50% to the artist Caleb. The initial costs, which are minimal, will be shared between the artist & Dylan and they will be reimbursed before any royalties are sent to the DAO.\n\nFat Cats holders will be whitelisted and will be able to mint before the public sale.\n\nWhy are we doing this? \nFat Cats take's it's branding very seriously and being part of as many news cycles as possibly is extremely important to us. Projects that have many derivatives of them tend to quickly become solidified in the minds of the NFT world. The current meta gives us a rare opportunity to earn more funds for our DAO, have a good laugh at the space and extend our brand influence & awareness. \n\nA similar situation occurred with Doodles who officially endorsed Noodles. https://opensea.io/collection/noodlesnft-official\n\n![goblincatz.png](ipfs://Qmd6ZnaMGFZPrjjB5vdVkmdEm83yUy46uU1HNRa8qroXqb)\n    \n    ",

The Council will be granted the discretion to decide on how big the liquidity pool should be. We will start it at 5 \n ETH and if there is significant demand increase it. We will make the collateralization a modest 30% ie if a Fat Cat is worth 0.1 ETH one could borrow 0.03 ETH. The loan period would be two weeks with the ability to extend the loan period. The earnings to the DAO Will be in the 10-20% range APY.\n\nDownside risk here is minimal as in the worst case scenario the DAO will end up with Fat Cats NFTs that we can sell or hold if the market is down. And we can explore a buy back option for people that defaulted (possibly a further week grace).\n\nWe can also explore creating liquidity pools for projects we are investors in as this will allow us to further show our strength in the market and connect us more closely to the communities and projects we believe in.\n\nPlease read the following to learn more: \nhttps://docs.pine.loans/technical-documentations/core/erc721lendingpool02\n    ",

      "content": "Ismtoys are a boutique toys and chess manufacturer in Canada who have produced very high quality 6 inch busts for notable Bored Ape holders as well as the likes of Alienfrens. \n\nWe would hire them to produce busts of Fat Cats that can be sold in our store. We would make two tiers of busts available: those the public can buy, as not having any would be a missed branding opportunity (karafuru & Doodles are doing the same), and some only Fat Cats holders can buy. The later would also have the option for holders to purchase a 1 of 1 replica of their exact Cat. The costs would be minimal ($500-700 range per prototype) to the DAO as we would only need to pay for the prototypes to be produced. In addition a percentage of the sale amount will go to the Fat Cats DAO (somewhere in the 10-15% range) thus enriching all Fat Cats holders whether they choose to purchase merchandize or not. These could also make incredible marketing prizes and gifts when we do long term partnerships with other communities or individuals.\n\nWe will also be able to produce chess sets and those could feature just Fat Cats and/or be paired with our friends such as Magic Mushroom Clubhouse or paired up against Bored Apes.\n\nThis mandate would allow the Council of Claw to negotiate the terms of the deal with Ism Toys. Please check out the site below and see a sample BAYC bust.\n\nhttps://ismtoys.ca/ \n![ism toys.jpeg](ipfs://QmVZtX91X9FbZBL8qEvGUGWoawTFfoz9xmRnx6WjuBPy9o)\n    ",

      "content": "It is an important pillar of this DAO that we aim for excellence while also being financially sustainable. We aim to maximize profit potential and adapt constantly to the ever changing NFT market. We are certainly in a recessionary/soft market right now. To that end the following stipends are proposed with the understanding that compensation will likely be revisited from time to time as the market adjusts, the DAO grows and the responsibilities and work load of our councilors:\n\nEach councilor receive a monthly stipend of $500 each. \n\nDylan Shub would receive $1000 due to his additional operations and partnership negotiation roles.\n\nCerealKiller like wise would receive $1000 as the community manager and collaborations lead.\n\nIn addition, each of the above, along with the collaborations team, would receive a whitelist spot for the different projects we get on our marketplace, as is common practice, except when the supply is 10 or less at which time Dylan will use his discretion on how many go to the raffle and so on. Also the DAO itself always takes priority over the individual and should we vote that a certain project is a quality potential for the small caps section of our portfolio, as many WL spots as deemed necessary by a DAO vote or the council, when time sensitive, would be allocated towards the DAO minting.\n\nAdditionally independent advisors such as Giancarlo Chaux will be compensated per consultation or meeting of the council. The proposed compensation is $150 per hour with that being the minimum and a pro-rata amount should it go over an hour.\n\nIt should also be noted that in the case of incubation, councilors or members of the DAO that take an operational lead, when Fat Cats becomes an official advisor, shall be able to negotiate compensation on a case by case bases as part of our overall compensation agreement with potential projects.",

      "content": "As we have just minted and will take a bit of time to elect our council I felt it was prudent to push for a vote to purchase a Bored Ape as we do not know when the market might rebound. Should the market rebound it is likely that the Big Caps will recover the fastest and so filling that segment of our portfolio should be our immediate priority.\n\nWe will need to vote on the asset allocation between Big Caps, Mid Caps & Small Caps soon, however it seems that the general consensus of the community is that the Big Caps will get somewhere in the range of 45-55% of the allocation which with our current treasury comes to at least 126 ETH. \n\nI propose that the DAO grants me a mandate to purchase a Bored Ape somewhere in the 85 ETH-100 ETH range with the priority being to buy the cheapest one possible via offers on the entire collection.  We did take a look for those that have unclaimed ApeCoin & Land however many of those seem to be held in vaults or are listed at prices that negate the benefits. That said I will attempt to purchase one of those if it seems favorable. And if it comes out to cost more than a 100 ETH but really comes out to less because of eg the Ape Coin being worth much more then I will attempt to do this too.\n\nI am pushing for us to purchase a Bored Ape instead of a Mutant because few NFTs fall so perfectly into both the important Archeological NFTs group as well as are part of an eco-system building a strong brand. Bored Apes are a much cleaner art style that also appeals to a greater and wider audience and are already wildly used as a social flex and the like by the rich and famous. It also goes without saying that this will look extremely good for the DAO branding wise and connect us to the elite of the NFT space. Yuga Labs has also shown that it makes enriching its holders a priority.\n\nThis mandate would also grant the incoming council, and myself until then, the ability to sell the Bored Ape if a majority of the council deem there to be a good reason to do so such as a market surge or some serious news surfacing about Yuga Labs (as was seen with Azuki).\n\nYes - If you are in favor of this proposal.\nNo - If you are against it.\n\nPlease direct discussions about the proposal to the holders channel, Fat Cats Den.",
