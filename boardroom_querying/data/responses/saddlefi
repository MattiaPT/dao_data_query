      "content": "## **Summary**\n\nEnsure the continued safety of user funds by winding down the protocol by pausing all pools and dissolving the community multisig. Additionally, airdrop protocol-owned $ARB tokens to $SDL, veSDL, and Saddle NFT holders and liquidate the remaining DAO treasury tokens to $ARB to be included in the airdrop. For those using contract wallets such as Gnosis Safe, the $ARB will be converted to ETH and then bridged to Ethereum Mainnet using Across Protocol and distributed accordingly. All other holders will receive $ARB on the Arbitrum network.\n\nThe eligible SDL supply is ~500M and veSDL supply is ~43M, which implies an airdrop amount of ~$0.0026 in ARB per SDL and ~$0.01 in ARB per veSDL.\n\n## **Background**\n\nThis SIP seeks to ensure the continued safety of user funds by winding down the protocol by pausing all liquidity pools and disbanding the community multisig. Additionally, reward $SDL and veSDL holders by distributing the protocol’s treasury to token holders. The distribution will account for the amount of $SDL tokens a wallet has and how long veSDL has been locked for. If passed, liquidity providers are advised to withdraw their funds.**\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nThe north star for Saddle has always been to be a community run and self sustaining protocol. The core contributors with the help of the wider community have completed the necessary groundwork to realize this vision - Saddle is the [premier open-source, MIT licensed StableSwap](https://github.com/saddle-finance/saddle-contract) and [the 9th most forked protocol by TVL](https://defillama.com/forks)! In light of this, many core contributors intend to step away from being actively involved by 9/30/23.\n\nThe community can decide to either:\n\n* Continue operating the protocol\n* Wind down the protocol to ensure the continued safety of user funds\n\nIf the community decides to continue operating the protocol, it will be necessary to support the [community multisig](https://docs.saddle.finance/saddle-faq#who-controls-saddles-admin-keys) and the [Delos HQ multisig](https://www.saddle.community/t/sip-x-delos-hq-community-multisig-responsibilities-and-compensation/422) on various operational tasks. However, we believe this will be hard to coordinate and manage over the long term.\n\nOn the other hand, the recent Vyper zero-day/Curve hack has shown that protocols are always at risk of exploits due to latent bugs. Additionally, the market value of the protocol’s treasury has recently exceeded the protocol’s circulating market cap. Many community members have proposed distributing the DAO’s $ARB airdrop to token holders ([past discussion](https://www.saddle.community/t/arb-tokens-as-incentives-for-sdl-vesdl-lp-sdl-eth-holders/626)), and after preliminary discussions with the community and core contributors we believe this is the best path forward to ensure the continued safety of user funds and recognize token holder value.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThe final multisig transaction will airdrop 1,545,242 $ARB tokens from the DAO treasury to holders, in addition to funds liquidated from other Saddle protocol-owned wallets and admin fees which will be converted to ARB. To calculate how many $ARB tokens holders receive is as follows:\n\n* $SDL held in user’s wallets, LP tokens, staked LP tokens, or held in vote escrow will receive a 1x multiplier\n* veSDL will receive a 4x multiplier\n* The 9 [Saddle Creator](https://opensea.io/collection/saddle-creators) NFTs will be counted as holding 350,000 SDL\n* The 1,080 [Badges for Bandits](https://opensea.io/collection/badges-for-bandits) NFTs will be counted as holding 7,500 SDL\n\nUsing these parameters a wallet's share of $ARB is then dictated by this formula:\n\n```\nwallet's % of airdrop = (wallet_sdl + 4 * wallet_vesdl) / (sdl_supply + 4 * vesdl_supply)\n```\n\nFrom this formula, we can derive the appropriate value of one SDL and veSDL:\n\n```\narb_dollar_value = $1.15 * 1_545_242 = $1_777_028\ntotal_sdl = 502_000_000\ntotal_vesdl = 43_000_000\n\nsdl_dollar_value = 1 * arb_dollar_value / (total_sdl + 4 * total_vesdl)\n= 1_777_028 / (502_000_000 + 4 * 43_000_000)\n= $0.0026\nvesdl_dollar_value = 4 * sdl_dollar_value = $0.0104\n```\n\nWallets which belong to Saddle or cannot be attributed to specific users (such as CEX’s or bridges) will be excluded from the airdrop. The “RetroVesting” contract used to initially airdrop vesting SDL is also excluded. The Ethereum snapshot block used for all these calculations will be block #[17820592](https://etherscan.io/block/17820592) (1 week ago), and the block with the closest timestamp for other chains.

      "content": "*Co-authored by: Yneas (Head BD @ Fluidity Money)*\n\n\n\n## **Summary**\n\nExpand Saddle's partnership with [Fluidity Money](https://fluidity.money) by adding their new pool to the gauges and requesting some SDL from the treasury to co-incentivize it.\n\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThis SIP seeks to bring the new community pool by Fluidity Money to Saddle’s gauge system, alongside some fabulous incentives from both protocols. The SIP also seeks to add the Fluidity multisig to the veSDL whitelist. Allowing them to lock SDL, participate in governance, and build products that utilize the vote escrow mechanism.\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\n*NOTE: Fluid USDC (fUSDC) is a yield bearing stablecoin. Whenever transferred, both sender and receiver (split 80%/20% respectively) become eligible for yield on a chance basis. The rewards come in 5 tiers, from 3 cents every other transaction to the current jackpot of 10k. The yield is dynamic, and increases with TVL due to the underlying mechanism. Every action taken on this pool comes with a chance to win.*\n\nAs members of the Atlantean Embassy, the partnership program of Fluidity Money, Saddle is able to generate revenue for the DAO stemming from Fluid Asset swaps. Users of the pool will be able to earn 80%, while Saddle will receive 20% of the yield in the treasury. This SIP aims to kickstart the utilization of this pool by rewarding liquidity provision with rewards stemming from both parties, hoping to create sustained volume, and thus sustained yield for the DAO which can be utilized in future endeavors. \n\nAdditionally, post IDO Fluidity Money will enact Utility Mining campaigns with their governance token $FLUID. This will see the activation of Utility Gauges on their platform, allowing users to vote using veFLUID. The votes on gauges determine pools that will receive emissions of $FLUID through the same mechanism that distributes yield on Fluid Assets. \n\nIn the near future, when Fluidity has launched their vote escrow mechanism, Saddle and Fluidity will extend their partnership with a token swap and lock agreement to participate in the gauges of each other's communities; this would see SDL being distributed through Utility Mining on the fUSDC - USDC pool.\n\n\n## **Specification**\n- Queue up a multisig transaction whitelisting 0xb590e67516e77f74Bb1aeC0c32dF2Fa4602cfe42\n- Add the [fUSDC-USDC](https://saddle.exchange/#/pools/fUSDC-USDC%20pool/deposit) pool to the gauges\n- Incentivize gauge with 1MIL SDL from the treasury over 3 months, to be matched with 10000 fUSDC by Fluidity Money\n",

      "title": "SIP-50: Launch SDL Liquidity Bootstrapping Partnership with Delta One",
      "content": "*Author: paulsengh | Delta One*\n\n## **Our Proposal**\n\nAs a member of the Saddle DAO and core contributor to Delta One, I am submitting a proposal to improve the liquidity of SDL on Uniswap by crafting a robust, tailor-made liquidity management dashboard that executes LP strategies and distributes rewards to high-quality LPs.\n\n[Delta One](https://deltaone.xyz/) is a liquidity management platform that offers data-driven and actionable insights for DAOs to cost-effectively create liquid markets for their token. Delta One is non-custodial, fully on-chain, and uses state-of-the-art analytics to keep the community informed.\n\n**Key Objectives**\n\nIn this partnership, Delta One aims to accomplish the following objectives:\n\n1. Cut liquidity mining costs by moving towards data-driven models for incentive distribution.\n2. Reduce price impact on Uniswap SDL pools to encourage more users to enter positions and participate in the network.\n3. Take a first principles approach to quantifying the amount of liquidity needed in SDL pools based on market demands, and distill this information into comprehensible liquidity scores.\n\nAt the time of this proposal, SDL only has ~$4.5k in liquidity on Uniswap V3. A $100k swap from USDC to SDL has a 60.3% slippage, which severely prohibits new users and institutions from participating in the network.\n\n**A Novel Liquidity Incentive Engine**\n\nDelta One will conduct a deep-dive analysis on the current set of liquidity providers on SDL pools, creating a model for rating an LP based on a variety of factors: time in the pool, price range supported, liquidity depth, historical performance, stickiness during times of volatility, and more. Delta One will then build a novel and seamless liquidity management dashboard for Saddle to distribute incentives to high-grade LPs in a single click. We believe this tailor-made incentive engine can significantly cut costs by rewarding LPs based on specific performance metrics, rather than supporting ephemeral yield farmers. Similar to our Uniswap demo found [here](https://deltaone.xyz/#/dao/sample-report), Delta One will create a robust dashboard for Saddle, with an intuitive interface to execute each recommended liquidity action.\n\n**Bolstering Saddle’s Presence on Uniswap**\n\nSaddle’s presence on Uniswap is underwhelming for a protocol of its stature, and we unequivocally encourage the DAO to prioritize this venue. Delta One plans to tackle this problem using a two-pronged approach. The first prong relies on a comprehensive analysis to formulate target TVL numbers for relevant pools on Uniswap. This first principles approach will take into account historical sell volumes. The second prong relies on using the data-driven incentive engine outlined above to cost-effectively source LPs for the SDL-USDC pool.\n\n##  **About Delta One**\n\nDelta One is a decentralized market making protocol that specializes in set-and-forget liquidity provisioning strategies. We work with a number of leading institutions, trading firms, and protail DeFi users to keep crypto markets liquid and confident. Given our proximity with leading market making participants, Delta One’s network is immensely valuable to DAOs that are looking to take their liquidity management to the next level. One of the major contributors to the protocol is OpenBlock Labs, which is backed by notable figures in the crypto space, including: Foundation Capital, Electric Capital, Circle Ventures, AlleyCorp, and others.\n\nSince its inception in 2021, Delta One has been working with a number of prominent DAOs and institutional players for liquidity management. It has also been audited by top-tier firms, including Halborn, OtterSec, and Neodyme.\n\nThe team has backgrounds from Stanford, a16z, Carnegie Mellon, Meta, Palantir, and other top-tier institutions; the highly technical background of our team makes us confident that Delta One is uniquely positioned to tackle a problem of this nature.\n\n# **Specification**\n\nPhase 1: Liquidity assessment and analytics\n\n* Delta One prepares a dynamic and robust report with insights that pertain to the key objectives above.\n\nPhase 2: Execute recommendations\n\n* Delta One creates a set of actionable strategies, and works with the DAO to safely and seamlessly execute the liquidity recommendations\n\nPhase 3: Continuous optimizations\n\n* Delta One provides a customized dashboard to track the DAO’s liquidity positions, provide assessment across key metrics, and update recommended actions.\n\nTo cover the costs of our engineers, designers, and quantitative analysts, Delta One requests a **1.5M SDL grant for a 3-month partnership.**\n\n# **Final Thoughts**\n\nDelta One looks forward to working closely with the Saddle DAO to make its current treasury more productive, while bolstering the liquidity of SDL token across the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nDelta One believes that this grant would be a great first step towards solidifying a productive relationship for both communities. We look forward to hearing the community’s thoughts, and answering any questions.\n\nThank you for your consideration.",

      "title": "SIP-49: baoUSD/FRAXBP gauge and treasury swap",
      "content": "*Author: Chickn | BAO*\n\n## Summary\n\n**This proposal is posted on both Saddle and Bao governance forums for both communities to vote on**. It intends to solidify the relationship between Saddle finance and BAO Finance and strengthen both protocols by simultaneously creating deeper liquidity on the Saddle DEX and for Bao’s synthetics.\n\nTo achieve this, it is initially proposed that each protocol will create a gauge on its own platform for the new baoUSD/FRAXBP pool on Saddle Finance\n\nIn addition, 1m SDL tokens will be swapped for 1m BAOv2 tokens, which have an approximately similar market value at the time of writing (around $6k). The Saddle and Bao teams will also have the option of another similar sized swap within the next 3 months that may or may not be implemented at the discretion of both teams.\n\nThe tokens will be max locked for 4 years on their respective platforms.\n\nSaddle will use their veBAO voting power to vote on Bao Finance gauges however they choose, share in the protocols revenue and earn a boost to liquidity rewards for any liquidity they choose to deposit. Bao will do the same with their veSDL.\n\n## Abstract\n\nBao’s and Saddle’s protocols can complement each other because BAO is a synthetic liquidity layer and Saddle are an exchange layer. Both need liquidity to be successful. By working together on this liquidity, both projects can increase their chances of success in these highly competitive markets.\n\nBao’s first synthetic is baoUSD, a USD-pegged token It is over-collateralized by debt positions and other stablecoins via its stability module. baoUSD has a focus on security and decentralization over everything else - after all, the whole point of a stablecoin is to remove volatility and risk. This is demonstrated by choosing only the safest collaterals and other innovations like the IMF, which reduces collateral factors for larger positions.\n\nYou can read more about the design of baoUSD in this medium article [The Stablecoin Trilemma and baoUSD | by chickn bao | Baommunity | Dec, 2022 | Medium](https://medium.com/baomunity/the-stablecoin-trilemma-and-baousd-228de8c8f0f2)\n\nor in the Bao Finance docs: https://info.bao.finance/docs/franchises/bao-markets-hard-synths\n\nIf approved by the Bao and Saddle community, Saddle would be the first external project to receive a gauge on the BAO platform, so it is likely to receive considerable support from the BAO community and receive future gauges for other synthetic tokens\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe passing of this SIP/BIP will allow Saddle to form a bonding relationship with BAO, a growing synthetic liquidity protocol and boost its own TVL in the process.\n\nBy including a gauge on both platforms, both communities will benefit from the support of each other. By swapping tokens, it is possible to put to work tokens that would otherwise be difficult to use without increasing sell pressure and ensure that both projects can start with a gauge weight that makes adding liquidity attractive on each other’s platforms.\n\n## Specification\n\nSaddle will deploy a gauge to Ethereum main net for the baoUSD-FRAXBP liquidity pool . BAO will deploy a similar gauge on [Bao Finance - Deliciously wrapped finance!](https://app.bao.finance/gauges/)\n\nSwap 1m SDL tokens for 1m BAOv2 tokens; both parties will max lock for 4 years. Option of swapping up to an additional 1m tokens in the next 3 months.\n\nFor a minimum of 8 weeks Bao will seed at least $50k liquidity to the baoUSD-FRAXBP gauge and use SDL rewards to max lock in veSDL to increase the gauge weight over time.",

      "content": "\n\n\n## **Summary**\n\nRamp up the Amplification Coefficient of the FRAXBP and a selection of its constituent metapools.\n\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThis SIP seeks to increase the Amplification Coefficient [known as, the ‘A’ parameter] of the FRAXBP and FRAXBP metapools on Mainnet and Arbitrum.\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nIncreasing the Amplification Coefficient of the FRAXBP metapools, and the FRAXBP itself, stands to give them a competitive depth and performance analogous to the industry standard.\n\nThe higher a pool’s Amplification Coefficient is, the wider the range of no-or-low-slippage swaps is. Lower slippage implies more competitive rates and greater volume, which will positively benefit both LPs and the protocol.\n\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThe multisig will queue txn’s to increase Amplification Coefficients according to the following table:\n\n|Pool|Chain|Current A|Proposed A|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|FRAX-USDC-BP|Mainnet|1000|1500|\n|FRAXBP-SUSD|Mainnet|200|500|\n|FRAXBP-USDT|Mainnet|200|800|\n|FRAX-USDC-BP|Arbitrum|500|1000|\n|FRAXBP-USDs|Arbitrum|100|400|\n|FRAXBP-USDT|Arbitrum|100|400|\n\n*[Note: The Amplification Coefficient will change over time as transactions occur, eventually reaching the target set by this proposal. The Amplification Coefficient may only increase by a maximum of 2x over the span of two weeks-- Meaning it may take some metapools up to 1 month to reach their desired 'A' value.]*\n\n\n**For**: Increase the amplification coefficients of Saddle Pools in accordance with the table above over the coming weeks.\n\n**Against**: No change.\n",

They have since paid and managed various community roles, and supported the ecosystem at large by locking a significant portion of their SDL with intent to help bolster newly acquired partners via the gauge system.\n\nMost recently, and notably, they have handled the rewards for the newly established SDL/USDs pool on [Demeter](https://demeter.sperax.io/farm/42161/0xe0B8DcF25E8e106c21Ee534f696cb43D8af11174?source=LandingPage), by The Sperax Foundation.\n\nThis refill would serve to allow Delos to continue their ongoing efforts in supporting Saddles growth and adoption throughout the ecosystem. In addition to the continuation of the Demeter rewards and payment of our fabulous community contributors, Delos would again lock up another significant portion of their allocated SDL; which would further bolster their impact on the gauges and serve as a noticeable incentive for new protocols to launch their pools with Saddle. \n\n\n\n## **Specification**\nSend 1.5m SDL to Multisig [0x03D319a9921474B9cdE1fff1DBaFba778f9eFEb0](https://etherscan.io/address/0x03D319a9921474B9cdE1fff1DBaFba778f9eFEb0)\n\n\n",

Allowing users to more effectively participate in Saddles ecosystem by way of Pitch.Money products and services.\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nAllowing Pitch.Money to bring Convex-like ve-token yield aggregator strategies to Saddle more efficiently would serve to dramatically increase the amount of users on-boarded into the ecosystem. Pitch estimates that these improvements could save upwards of **4500** gas per tx.\n\n*Pitch.Money would like to note that any depositors in the original pool can reach out to them for a* ***refund.***\n\n\n## **Specification**\nQueue up a multisig transaction whitelisting **0x2Cba8a85f44dD1Da10a093Cc0F96D93b3C37e0ee**\n\n\n**For**: Add the new Pitch.Money voter proxy contract to the veSDL whitelist.\n\n**Against**: No change.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "## **Summary**\nAdd a quorum to the Saddle.Finance Snapshot votes.\n\n\n## **Abstract**\nThis SIP seeks to modify the current governance procedure, outlined [here](https://docs.saddle.finance/governance), in favour of a system with a minimum number of votes required for proposals to pass.\n\n\n## **Motivation**\nWIth SDL coming into maturity as an asset, its circulating supply is becoming larger each day. As it stands, with no quorum on the votes, an opportunity to allow proposals through which do not effectively represent the collective goals of the DAO becomes a tangible concern. Introduction of a quorum would ensure that no proposals are able to pass unless they represent the interests held by a meaningful percentage of the DAO. \n\nWhen considering average participation in governance [using gauge votes as a measure], and the current vesting schedule as a loose indicator of the future circulating supply; an initial quorum of 2% should be sufficient to capture an accurate representation of how the DAO leans on any given proposal.\n\n*Note: As governance participation increases, and the amount of SDL vesting decreases, it may be in our best interest to increase this quorum again at some point in the future.*\n\n\n## **Specification**\n\n* A quorum of **2% of the circulating supply of SDL** is required for the result of a vote to be valid.\n\n* The quorum will not be applied if the proposal alters **SDL emissions on Minichef’s or Gauges**.\n\n* The circulating supply calculation is based on the block of the Snapshot vote.\n\nA Saddle.Finance Snapshot admin is to install the quorum plugin with the aforementioned parameters at the time of this proposal’s passing.\n\n",

      "title": " SIP-41: Clipper <> Saddle",
      "content": "*Proposal Authored by: andrex*\n\n## **Summary**\n\nProposal to make SDL more easily tradable by more people by (a) bridging it to Polygon and (b) ensuring competitive prices by committing $200K SDL in liquidity and mining incentives to a Clipper SDL pool. Clipper is integrated into 1inch, so prices will permeate the market instantly. Clipper is the most capital efficient way to ensure <1% slippage on the average trade size against WBTC, MATIC, USDC, USDT, and DAI. By making trades cheap and ensuring low spreads, volume and the number of holders should increase.\n\n\n## **Background**\n\nPolygon is a side chain  built on top of Ethereum. It is faster and cheaper at the tradeoff of slightly less security, which makes it great for retail traders making small swaps. For this reason, the average trade size on Ethereum Mainnet is more than 30x larger than the average trade size on Polygon. Of course, because there are more retail traders than whales and because lower gas means lower trading costs, there are also many more swaps on Polygon. Polygon has become the most liquid Layer 2 for small trades.\n\nClipper is a DEX focused on retail trades developed by [Shipyardsoftware](https://shipyardsoftware.org) and governed by Admiral DAO. Clipper has the best prices on trades <$50K (at the tradeoff of worse prices on larger trades). It accomplishes this by (a) capping TVL, which enables much lower trading fees without materially impacting slippage for small trades, netting out to lower prices, and (b) consolidating short-tail assets (WBTC/ETH/Stables) into one pool (Clipper Core) and then using those LP tokens in a series of two-asset pools (Clipper Coves) with each long-tail token (e.g. a SDL + Clipper LP Token pool). The result is 20x more capital efficiency than Uniswap. Specifically, a SDL<>ClipperLP pool would require only $15k in SDL and $15k in short-tail assets (WBTC, ETH or stables) to achieve <5% slippage and only $100k in SDL and $100K in short-tail assets ($200k total) to achieve <1% slippage. Since Clipper is integrated into 1inch, most traders and wallets would instantly see price improvements for their SDL swaps.\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nOne way to increase volume is by making it less expensive to trade. The main cost to trade is gas on Ethereum. This can be reduced by bridging to Polygon, which has much lower gas fees. The second cost to trade is slippage. This can be reduced by providing liquidity to a DEX on Polygon. The community should do so in whichever DEX provides the best prices while requiring the least liquidity (capital efficiency). That implies creating an SDL pool on Clipper. \n\nTo ensure <1% slippage on the $350 average size polygon trade, I propose the Treasury should deposit $100k in SDL directly into the Clipper SDL pool and provide another $100k in SDL as liquidity mining rewards to incentivize an equal amount of short-tail assets (e.g. WBTC, ETH or USDC), or for exchange and deposit if more efficient.\n\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThe community can deposit $100k in SDL directly into the relevant Clipper pool. This is noncustodial, so will remain on the DAOs balance sheet. The other $100K should be distributed to LPs who provide other assets. The DAO can do this themselves or ask AdmiralDAO to manage the distribution process.\n\n\n**For:** Bridge 200K USD worth of SDL, calculated using Uniswap’s V3 TWAP price on [Euler](https://app.euler.finance/market/0xf1dc500fde233a4055e25e5bbf516372bc4f6871) at the time the proposal ends, from multisig *0x3F8E527aF4e0c6e763e8f368AC679c44C45626aE*, to Polygon. With intent to establish an incentivized Clipper pool on the network. \n\n**Against:** No change.\n\n\n",

By staking SDL, the Layer2DAO can control a significant portion of locked SDL and this provides a major benefit such that: Layer2DAO can vote for SDL emissions to be directed towards L2 farms on Saddle, ensuring deep liquidity and strong returns for those providing liquidity on L2 Ethereum.\n\nL2DAO is laser-focused on growing L2 ecosystem projects and partnering with Saddle paves the way for TVL to grow on L2s such as Arbitrum and Optimism. Layer2DAO will be focusing all governing power towards directing SDL emissions to L2s.\n\n**Swap Executed Trustlessly Thanks To Hedgey Finance**\n\nThis DAO-to-DAO on-chain token swap was executed in collaboration with our partner,[  Hedgey Finance](https://twitter.com/hedgeyfinance/status/1567870850187018240). The transaction was completed seamlessly through the Hedgey UI, allowing The Layer2DAO treasury to execute an entirely trustless token swap with the Saddle Finance treasury, on Arbitrum(?).\n\nHedgey sees DAO-to-DAO token swaps as a new way for DAOs to collaborate with each other; allowing DAOs to strengthen their partnership by investing in each other, participating in each other's governance, and staking. To learn more about how you can utilize Hedgey for DAO-to-DAO token swaps, DAO compensation/locked token distributions, or OTC trades, go to[  hedgey.finance](https://hedgey.finance/) or join their [Discord](https://discord.gg/hedgey).\n\n**About Saddle Finance:**\n\nSaddle is a decentralized automated market maker on the Ethereum (and other EVM) blockchains, optimized for pegged value crypto assets across multiple chains.\n\nSaddle believes in collaboration, in building Saddle as a DeFi lego block, and in helping DeFi teams bring pegged asset swaps to any blockchain or L2. Go to[  saddle.finance](https://saddle.finance/#/) on the web to learn more. Saddle is collaborative and fun to work with: We root our ethos in the desire to[  support](https://docs.saddle.finance/build-with-saddle) the DeFi ecosystem and partner with like-minded protocols.\n\nSaddle stands for DeFi: We commit ourselves to [open-source software](https://github.com/saddle-finance) and collaboration to fulfill the promise of DeFi, of financial Lego blocks.\n\n**About Layer2DAO:**\n\nLayer2DAO is expanding the Ethereum L2 ecosystem and investing in L2 ecosystem projects. The DAO uses its treasury to invest into high-impact L2 protocols and ecosystem plays, serving as a diversified venture fund for investors looking to gain exposure to the L2 ecosystem growth.\n\nLearn more about the Layer2DAO at[  layer2dao.org](https://layer2dao.org/) or check out the project's[  documentation](https://docs.layer2dao.org/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelayer2dao) |[ Discord](https://discord.gg/layer2dao)\n\n\n\n## **Specification**\n\nRequest 1MM SDL from multisig: 0x3F8E527aF4e0c6e763e8f368AC679c44C45626aE, for multisig: 0x5318f07A3a20A2f8bb0DDf14F1DD58C517a76508.\n\nSaddle to lock all L2DAO obtained in this agreement in the xL2DAO vault for the max duration of two 2 year terms. Layer2DAO vaults only allow for a maximum lock of 2 years. At the end of the first lock Saddle will roll the lock for another 2 year term, for a total of 4 years.\n\nL2DAO to lock all SDL obtained in this agreement as veSDL for the max duration of 4 years.\n\nUse [Hedgey.Finance](https://www.hedgey.finance/) to execute the swap.\n\nSwap to be executed no longer than 72 hours after the passing of this SIP. \n\n**For:** Enter into a tokenswap agreement with L2DAO.\n**Against:** No change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": " SIP-39: Whitelist Pitch to Stake veSDL, Offer pitchSDL, and Establish Liquidity Pool",
      "content": "*Proposal Authored by: Mahni | Pitch.Money*\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nThis proposal suggests whitelisting the Pitch Foundation to stake veSDL through a smart contract so it can offer pitchSDL: a liquid wrapper with governance integration. It also proposes establishing an SDL/pitchSDL liquidity pool and gauge to allow pitchSDL holders to exit their governance positions.\n\n[](https://www.saddle.community/t/sip-x-whitelist-pitch-to-stake-vesdl-offer-pitchsdl-and-establish-liquidity-pool/455#background-2)Background\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEarlier this month, Saddle and Pitch entered into a comprehensive partnership to provide services for the former's budding governance infrastructure. The first solution we provided was a robust [vote incentives marketplace 1](https://pitch.money/saddle) for Saddle's 11 Ethereum Mainnet gauges, which debuted on Wednesday, August 24, 2022.\n\nUsing the Governance Console, liquidity providers can now incentivize votes for their pools to optimize emissions flows and boost ROI, all while rewarding their voters for ensuring emissions go to their gauges.\n\n[](https://www.saddle.community/t/sip-x-whitelist-pitch-to-stake-vesdl-offer-pitchsdl-and-establish-liquidity-pool/455#motivation-3)Motivation\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBut the vote incentives marketplace still revolves around vote-escrow tokenomics, forcing governance participants into highly illiquid positions for up to 4 years. Pitch has [routinely used liquid wrapper tokenomics](https://mirror.xyz/0xfceEF8F8C8fF6CeD87EB8F92B972F3fCdE3230B4/s_6fJLzO7nJRs06A6d2yQLM2112BIzMjdqlFgeqFGh4) to mitigate against this illiquidity, and plans now to do so for Saddle.\n\nWith a liquid wrapper, SDL holders will be able to provide Pitch with their unlocked tokens in return for pitchSDL, which they will then use to vote on gauge weights through Pitch's Snapshot. Once their proxy votes are cast, Pitch will vote on their behalf using its veSDL treasury. Any rewards accrued will be distributed back to voters pro rata, at which point they may be relocked for more pitchSDL or swapped for other tokens.\n\nTo ensure that the pitchSDL liquid wrapper is truly liquid, this proposal also suggests establishing a liquidity pool and corresponding gauge for the pitchSDL/SDL pair. This pool will allow pitchSDL holders to exit their governance positions at any time. The gauge will ensure adequate emissions flows as rewards to pitchSDL/SDL liquidity providers.\n\n[](https://www.saddle.community/t/sip-x-whitelist-pitch-to-stake-vesdl-offer-pitchsdl-and-establish-liquidity-pool/455#specification-4)Specification\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis SIP will provide liquidity for those in Saddle governance positions with the liquid wrapper tokenomics described above. This will effectively render governance positions liquid while retaining access to vote incentives and ve-token yield through on-demand exit functionality with a pitchSDL/SDL liquidity pool. It will also establish a liquidity gauge to facilitate the wrapper's liquidity.\n\nFor:\n\n-   Whitelist the following contracts to enable veSDL staking for pitchSDL:\n    -   0x1a381C7a8A47E2e7247d45eC374391129d1B6021\n    -   0x17A67BDb5cfB7A21781240997505d69A398813Bc\n    -   0xF942f26188229025AA81aE96cc0D19408Bd62dd9\n-   Establish SDL/pitchSDL liquidity pool on all platforms supporting any Saddle liquidity pools\n-   Establish SDL/pitchSDL liquidity gauge on all platforms supporting any Saddle liquidity gauges",

The $SDL is to be used for marketing, operations, and promotional activities. \n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThis SIP seeks to facilitate the institutional support of Saddle’s governance token, $SDL\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nInstitutional support represents massive step toward fully realizing the utility of $SDL as laid out in [SIP-8](https://snapshot.org/#/saddlefinance.eth/proposal/0x39d35717275a8d288763c3ed9a6c660fce59099fc519e507111627f722a767a2), and should see a dramatic impact on the incentive to lock $SDL in the gauges. Institutional support should also serve to ease the path for those developers, and protocols, who are looking to build products with, out of, or on top of, $SDL and $veSDL.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nTransfer 60K USD worth of $SDL, calculated using Uniswap’s V3 TWAP price on [Euler](https://app.euler.finance/market/0xf1dc500fde233a4055e25e5bbf516372bc4f6871), at the time the proposal ends, from multisig: 0x3F8E527aF4e0c6e763e8f368AC679c44C45626aE to a to-be disclosed address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "*Proposal Authored by: Weston Nelson | Layer2DAO*\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nThis proposal is to add the [Layer2DAO](https://layer2dao.org/) Multisig and relevant contracts to the veSDL Whitelist.\n\n[](https://www.saddle.community/t/sip-x-add-layer2dao-on-the-vesdl-whitelist/457#abstract-2)Abstract\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis SIP seeks to add the Layer2DAO Multisig to the veSDL whitelist. Allowing them to lock $SDL, participate in governance, and build products that utilize the vote escrow mechanism.\n\n[](https://www.saddle.community/t/sip-x-add-layer2dao-on-the-vesdl-whitelist/457#background-3)Background\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEthereum Layer 2 scaling solutions present an enormous opportunity for Saddle to capture new users, TVL, and market share in the crypto ecosystem. The Layer2DAO ($L2DAO) is a protocol focused on encouraging and supporting projects like Saddle Finance, with similar values of increasing Web3 user adoption.\n\n[](https://www.saddle.community/t/sip-x-add-layer2dao-on-the-vesdl-whitelist/457#motivation-4)Motivation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nL2DAO has demonstrated they have a strong interest in aligning and building a long-term mutually beneficial relationship between Saddle Finance and the Layer2DAO. The visions and values of the DAOs align very closely and there is immense potential for synergistic benefits to come from partnering. L2DAO has been acquiring $SDL on the open market with intent to lock and participate in gauges -- and with plans to bring Convex-like ve-token yield aggregator strategies to L2; Whitelisting the Layer2DAO Multisig and required contracts gives those protocols supported by Saddle the opportunity to grab more $SDL emissions for their communities in gauge votes [via bribing]. This change will likely increase the utility of the $SDL token by giving lockers a way to automatically optimize yield and a means to earn additional yield from protocols willing to pay for their influence.\n\nThis SIP will enable the Layer2DAO to create a yield-optimizer that benefits $SDL token holders and creates a strong market dynamic/incentive to lock $SDL, a key measurement of protocol success.\n\n[](https://www.saddle.community/t/sip-x-add-layer2dao-on-the-vesdl-whitelist/457#specification-5)Specification\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n**For:** Add the following contracts to the veSDL Whitelist:\n\nLayer2DAO Multisig: [0x634EAbE7C03Bcf701a5FF3C0510E9AcB2d5F5196](https://etherscan.io/address/0x634eabe7c03bcf701a5ff3c0510e9acb2d5f5196)\n\nLayer2DAO SDL Voter Proxy: [0x882094c153d83da48df9660e7470a478199f1bd5](https://etherscan.io/address/0x882094c153d83da48df9660e7470a478199f1bd5#code)\n\n**Against:** No change.",

      "title": "SIP-36: Deploy pSDL/SDL pool, and whitelist Loopfi voter",
      "content": "*Proposal Authored by: David | Loopfi*\n\nSummary\n-------\n\nLoopfi aims to become the home for veSDL stakers and LPs of Saddle Finance to enjoy the best possible returns, and partner with Saddle to make the governance more diversified and resilient.\n\n[](https://www.saddle.community/t/proposal-to-saddle-finance/461#background-2)Background\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Loopfi](https://loopfi.io/) is a decentralized user-owned protocol offering a liquidity solution for Vote-Escrowed Token (i.e., veSDL), allowing users to walk away from the complexity of the gauge boosting system, and maximizing the utility of their deposits with protocols supported (i.e., Saddle Finance).\n\nIn the case of Saddle, Loopfi will pool all users' SDL together and lock them up for 4 years, then maximize rewards for Loopfi liquidity providers. Users will also be rewarded with LPF tokens, in addition to SDL emission and Saddle protocol fees. By locking up LPF on Loopfi, users will receive pLPF and vote in the DAO decision-making process to decide the SDL emissions for Saddle gauges.\n\npSDL is the tokenized version of the time-locked veSDL. When you stake SDL through Loopfi, you will receive pSDL at 1:1 ratio. Each pSDL represents 1 veSDL participating in lock-up staking for a maximum of 4 years.\n\nLoopfi was launched in July with dForce the first partner to support. Loopfi allows users to stake DF for pDF to earn max boost on DF staking rewards while keeping a liquid position. We look forward to building trust and establishing a long-term relationship with Saddle Finance on the basis of mutual benefits.\n\nThe Loopfi codebase is based on the code of Convex. Their audit reports can be viewed [here](https://github.com/mixbytes/audits_public/tree/master/Convex%20Platform).\n\n[](https://www.saddle.community/t/proposal-to-saddle-finance/461#motivation-3)Motivation\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe partnership between Loopfi and Saddle will create a win-win situation for both parties.\n\nFor SDL holders, Loopfi enables you to:\n\n-   receive max boost on SDL emission and Saddle platform fees;\n-   access to liquidity for veSDL stakers;\n-   earn more Saddle governance voting power;\n-   earn a share of the Loopfi platform fee.\n\nFor Saddle liquidity providers, Loopfi enables you to:\n\n-   receive max boost on liquidity provided;\n-   receive max boost on SDL emission and Saddle platform fees;\n-   access to liquidity for veSDL stakers;\n-   earn more Saddle governance voting power;\n-   earn a share of the Loopfi platform fee.\n\nFor the Saddle community,\n\n-   Loopfi will help to lock up more veSDL to a maximum possible extent, which strongly aligns with Saddle's long-term development.\n-   Also, onboarding Loopfi will help Saddle diversify its token holder and governance participation.\n\nFor the Loopfi community,\n\n-   we will be able to accumulate enough veSDL to give a significant boost to the pSDL/SDL pool for higher rewards and deep liquidity.\n-   we will also be incentivising pSDL/SDL and SDL/LPF pools with LPF token.\\\n    $LPF Incentive\n\nLPF token is the platform token acting as a governance and incentivization tool within Loopfi system.\n\n6,000,000 LPF will be allocated to Saddle to incentivize SDL staking and the pSDL/SDL pool for the first year, subject to governance approval:\n\n-   SDL staking: 3,000,000 LPF\n-   pSDL/SDL pool on Saddle: 3,000,000 LPF\n\nAlso, we will set up a LPF/SDL pool on Sushiswap and are happy to incentivize LPs through a joint initiative with Saddle.\n\n[](https://www.saddle.community/t/proposal-to-saddle-finance/461#specification-4)Specification\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWe will be setting up stableasset pool - pSDL/SDL pool on Saddle Ethereum. Therefore, it is proposed that Saddle can support us by:\n\n-   setting up a gauge for the pSDL/SDL pool on Ethereum so that TVL will be captured by Saddle;\n-   allocating some team votes to bootstrap the pSDL/SDL pool;\n-   staking through Loopfi and providing liquidity for the pSDL/SDL pool, so that Saddle can access liquidity for time-locked veSDL, and accumulate LPF tokens for participation in Loopfi governance;\n-   Loopfi and Saddle co-incentivise LPF/SDL pool on Sushi (Loopfi and dForce co-incentivize LPF/USX pool on both Ethereum and Arbitrum).\n\n**For:**\n-   setting up a gauge for the pSDL/SDL pool on Ethereum so that TVL will be captured by Saddle;\n-   allocating some team votes to bootstrap the pSDL/SDL pool;\n-   staking through Loopfi and providing liquidity for the pSDL/SDL pool, so that Saddle can access liquidity for time-locked veSDL, and accumulate LPF tokens for participation in Loopfi governance;\n-   Loopfi and Saddle co-incentivise LPF/SDL pool on Sushi (Loopfi and dForce co-incentivize LPF/USX pool on both Ethereum and Arbitrum).\n-   Queue up a multisig transaction whitelisting Loopfi voter at: 0x6E399F1d376237aE705DD015894fC3FB559521b4\n\n**Against:** Do nothing",

      "content": "\n\n\n## **Summary**\n\nRequest 2,600,000MM [$SDL](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/saddle-finance) from the treasury, to satisfy the marketing requirements of a reputable crypto institution. The $SDL is to be used for marketing, operations, and promotional activities. \n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThis SIP seeks to facilitate the institutional support of Saddle’s governance token, $SDL\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nInstitutional support represents massive step toward fully realizing the utility of $SDL as laid out in [SIP-8](https://snapshot.org/#/saddlefinance.eth/proposal/0x39d35717275a8d288763c3ed9a6c660fce59099fc519e507111627f722a767a2), and should see a dramatic impact on the incentive to lock $SDL in the gauges. Institutional support should also serve to ease the path for those developers, and protocols, who are looking to build products with, out of, or on top of, $SDL and $veSDL.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nTransfer 2,600,000MM $SDL from multisig: 0x3F8E527aF4e0c6e763e8f368AC679c44C45626aE to a to-be disclosed address.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "*SIP: Co-authored with Sperax*\n\n## **Summary**\n\nExchange 2,000,000 [$SDL](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/saddle-finance) for 5,000,000 [$SPA](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sperax), both teams will lock their received tokens for 4 years. \n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThis SIP seeks to strengthen the partnership between Saddle and [Sperax](https://www.sperax.io) by way of a tokenswap between our protocols.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nSince [SIP-5](https://snapshot.org/#/saddlefinance.eth/proposal/0x7e06e54499be85fe4267b78acd24f735365797b71ad401fc0f44fff157eb35d1), Saddle and Sperax have collaborated to bring deep liquidity to the popular $USDs token and broader Arbitrum market. A tokenswap would stand to tighten the bond between our protocols, and give Sperax the power to vote in Saddles gauges– furthering the incentive for Sperax users to continue supporting the liquidity of $USDs.\n\nIn addition to deepening the relationship between both protocols, this swap and locking of SDL would further diversify the nascent veSDL voting blocks, strengthening the veSDL voting community. \n\nBy acquiring SPA the Saddle community can stake this for veSPA. This allows holders to govern the $USDs collateral pool, unlocking the ability to vote on collateral investment strategies. For this, stakers are paid a revenue split from the yield generated and all protocol fees. This collateral can be deployed to Saddle to boost TVL. Once the Demeter protocol is launched, veSPA holders will also control the gauge. Directing SPA emissions to desired trading pairs. \n\n\n## **Specification**\n\nTransfer 2,000,000SDL from multisig: 0x3F8E527aF4e0c6e763e8f368AC679c44C45626aE, to multisig: 0xD95791bcab484C0552833cB558d18d4D3F198AF9\n\nUse [Hedgey.Finance](https://www.hedgey.finance/) to execute the swap.\n\nSwap to be executed 48 hours after the passing of this SIP. \n\n\n**For:** Enter into a tokenswap agreement with Sperax.\n**Against:** No change.\n\n\n",

Such a program would represent a milestone on the path toward honouring the security goals originally laid out in the *‘motivation’* section of [SIP-21](https://snapshot.org/#/saddlefinance.eth/proposal/0xf27b07ef7025aa23edb2a84d56825511ea7adff8d6164cd09a23c63c42cdc01a).\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nFollowing the events of the last few months, a focus on security is paramount to the operation and reputation of all DeFi protocols going forward– this is especially true for those protocols seeking to build open source implementations of primitives fundamental to the industry as a whole. Formalizing the terms of an official bug bounty program would serve to incentivize whitehats as an additional preventative measure to exploits; this is preferred industry-wide to the more reactive approach of offering a bounty post-exploit to blackhats.  \n\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThe bounty is to be calculated as the lower value of 10% of the total possible exploit or 5MM SDL. The bounty will be delivered immediately [at the behest of multisignature collection] as liquid SDL.\n\n*Note: This bounty would not cover any front-end/visual bugs, or any server-side code of any web application that interacts with Saddle. The Saddle Bug Bounty is applicable only to vulnerable smart contract code: defined as contracts deployed by Saddle, on any chain, that manage the value of Saddle’s treasury assets and/or user deposited assets.  This bounty is a \"no questions asked\" policy for disclosures and/or immediate return of funds after any incident.*\n\n\n**For**: Formalize the proposed terms of the Saddle Bug Bounty program.\n\n**Against**: Resubmit with modified terms.\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "*SIP Authored by: AlexMultifarm*\n\n## **Summary**\nProvide an in-depth custom analytics dashboard centred around Saddle and its ve-tokenomics. Thereby providing further transparency for Saddle’s community and team members.\n\n## **Abstract**\nGovernance will decide whether to partner with Multifarm to create a custom analytical dashboard for them. If ratified, Multifarm will proceed to start the process by designing the dashboard with the essence & values of Saddle in mind.\n\n## **Motivation**\nThe Multifarm team has been in communication with the Saddle team over creating a custom analytics dashboard for them & you, their community. We however believe that in the name of transparency, we should reach out over the governance forums and introduce ourselves. This also allows the community a chance to weigh in.\n\nAs it currently stands, Dune analytics is not providing enough transparency & is limited in its visibility. Multifarm has partnered with leading protocols such as OlympusDAO, Balancer, Redacted Cartel & ParagonsDAO in order to create impactful analytics dashboards ranging from Bribing, Treasury management, NFTs and whatever need our client has. ([Link to OlympusDAO dashboard](https://app.olympusdao.finance/#/dashboard))\n\nOur plan is to build an in-depth custom analytics dashboard for Saddle Finance in order for their end users to be able to transparently visualize all of the stats and analytics surrounding veSDL.\n\nWe believe that this will not only aid users in making better investment decisions but as well as Saddle finance team to be able to use the dashboard data for monitoring/tracking/reporting needs.\n\nWe furthermore see areas where Multifarm can help Saddle with imperative analytics over their future planned features such as LP Locking & Collateralized LP lending. We already have thought of some useful stats around this.\n\nHere is an example of bribing focused design for [Balancer](https://demo.multifarm.fi/Dashboard):\n     \n![dash.png](ipfs://bafkreicljrac6tho4f7qnq7zb7zyogmab4r2m4rkijonsgo4jrsitpqrhm)\n*ipfs hosted: 1578×796 87.4 KB*\n\n## **Specification**\n**Yield Analytics Dashboard:**\n\n* General Stats (TVL, Volume, Total Supply, Staked Supply, etc)\n* Pool Stats (TVL, Fee APR, Emissions APR, Reward Boost, Revenues)\n* Historical Data (APRS, TVLS, etc) (Similar to Llama airforce for Curve)\n* Risk Data (e.g Synthetic Assets)\n* Gauge Weight Over Time\n* Bribe & Voting Analytics (i.e focus new ve tokenomics)\n\n**veToken Analytics:**\n\n* veToken (General Stats like Total veToken)\n* veToken Power (e.g veToken Power by Top Holders, Accumulation over time)\n* veToken Voting (e.g veToken Votes by Gauge)\n* veToken Locking (e.g. Percentage)\n* Votes by Gauges & Holders\n\n **LP Locking & Collateralized LP Lending Stats:**\n\n* General Historical Stats\n  + TVL History for each asset/market\n  + LTV Rates\n  + Liquidations History\n  + Total Lent v Borrowed\n  + Total Supplied & Total Available\n  + Market Supply\n* Data on Deposits & Locking\n  + Average Locking\n  + Average deposit amount\n  + Average time until unlock\n* Repayments\n* Data centered around users\n  + Withdrawals\n  + Collateral added/removed\n  + Stable v Unstable rates\n  + Deposits\n  + Type of assets collateralized or borrowed\n\n**For:** Create a custom analytical dashboard for Saddle\n\n**Against:** Do not create a custom impactful analytical dashboard for Saddle & its community \n",

      "content": "## **Summary**\n\nReplace Saddle Multisigner Kain Warwick of Synthetix, with Sam Kazemian of Frax. Additionally, add Weston Nelson from the Saddle community.\n\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThis SIP seeks to replace Kain Warwick of Synthetix as a signer on the Saddle multisig. Kain has done a tremendous job thus far and we thank him for his many, many signatures. This SIP also seeks to add an additional signer to the multisig, from the Saddle community, to improve the efficiency of operations. \n\nIt is worth noting that this SIP does not represent a strain on the relationship between our protocols. Kain remains close with the team, and our protocols remain connected via virtual swaps.\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nMoving to a 3/8 represents a best case scenario for Saddle in terms of both security and operational efficiency.\n\nA quality signer for the multisig from Frax would stand to both increase the efficiency of signature gathering, and strengthen the partnership between our products. The intent of this proposal is to further improve the efficiency and interconnectivity of the multisig; replacing a signer with someone from an organization like Frax [with whom we are in constant contact with] may help to improve our operations without sacrificing any of the multisigs reputation. \n\n\n## **Specification**\n\nInitiate a transaction replacing \n0x5b97680e165b4dbf5c45f4ff4241e85f418c66c2 with 0x17e06ce6914E3969f7BD37D8b2a563890cA1c96e, at multisig 0x3F8E527aF4e0c6e763e8f368AC679c44C45626aE. Additionally, add 0xD131F1BcDd547e067Af447dD3C36C99d6be9FdEB as a signer to 0x3F8E527aF4e0c6e763e8f368AC679c44C45626aE.\n\n\n**For**: Replace Kain Warwick with Sam Kazemian and add Weston as signers for Saddle’s multisig\n\n**Against**: No change.\n",

      "content": "## **Summary:**\n\nThis is a proposal to launch a $sETH/$ETH pool on Optimism to create the deepest pair of Synthetic $ETH liquidity on Optimism\n\n**Authored by Weston Nelson**\n\n## **Background/Motivation:**\n\nSynthetix is the leading derivatives protocol in DeFi, and has been the most battle-tested protocol as well. They have been largely responsible for the push to L2 adoption and specifically with Optimism. There is clear need for deep liquidity - similar to what can be delivered by Curve on Mainnet, but for an $sETH/$ETH pool on Optimism, that Saddle can be the solution for.  \n\n\nThis proposal outlines a a new pool on Optimism that would be comprised of $sETH and $ETH. \n\nLPs benefit from yield earned on their deposits in addition to trading fees and liquidity incentives. \n\nCapital efficiency is the top priority for AMMs, and enabling LPs to earn yield passively - in addition - to other incentives is an extremely compelling proposition for users looking to provide liquidity on Optimism and to grow the TVL on the Optimism rollup itself. \n\n## **Specification:**\n\nSaddle to create a new pool for $sETH/$ETH on Optimism.\n\nEngage in discussions with other protocols to temp check interest in adding further incentives to this pool, to drive even further liquidity to Optimism. \n\n## **References:**\n\nSynthetix Documentation: https://docs.synthetix.io/ \nSynthetix Staking App: https://staking.synthetix.io/\n\n## **Vote:** ##\n\n**For**: Authorize an $sETH/$ETH pool deployment on Optimism.\n\n**Against**:  Do nothing",

      "content": "\n## **Summary**\n\nRamp up the Amplification Coefficient of the new FRAXBP, as well as any constituent metapools, that meet the standard for TVL set out by this proposal.\n\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThis SIP seeks to increase the Amplification Coefficient [known as, ‘A’] of the FRAXBP and FRAXBP metapools with > $1m TVL.\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nIncreasing the Amplification Coefficient from 100 to 500 on FRAXBP metapools, and from 500 to 1000 on the FRAXBP itself, should give them a more competitive depth, and performance analogous to the industry standard.\n\nThe higher a pool’s Amplification Coefficient is, the wider the range of no-or-low-slippage swaps is. Lower slippage implies more competitive rates and greater volume, which will positively benefit both LPs and the protocol.\n\n\n## **Specification**\n\nThe multisig will queue txn’s to increase Amplification Coefficients according to the following table:\n|Pool|TVL ($)|Current A|Proposed A|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|FRAXBP|+1M|500|1000|\n|FRAXBP[meta]|+1M|100|500|\n\n*[Note: The Amplification Coefficient will change over time as transactions occur, eventually reaching the target set by this proposal. The Amplification Coefficient may only increase by a maximum of 2x over the span of two weeks-- Meaning it may take some metapools up to 1.5 months to reach their desired 'A' value.]*\n\n\n**For**: Ramp up the 'A' of the FRAXBP, from 500 to 1000. Ramp up the 'A' of any metapools with +$1m TVL containing FRAXBP LP tokens, from 100 to 500.\n\n**Against**: No change.\n",

Syndicate term length is 1 year.\n\n### How Do Syndicate Elections Work?\n1. SDL Token holders will vote on Snapshot. This vote is a Weighted vote that allows you to vote for multiple candidates. Each voter may spread their voting power across any number of choices.\n2. Top 7 individuals with the most votes will be elected to Delos HQ. \n3. Ties on the token holder snapshots will be determined by separate Discord-based votes.\n4. SDL token holders may put up a vote to remove syndicate members from Delos HQ if necessary before the 1 year term is up and are responsible for electing future syndicate members.\n\nMembers of Delos HQ will play a crucial role in the growth and success of the greater Saddle DAO.\n \n## Candidates\n\n- emac#0046\n- justpat#5612\n- nikitakle#4627\n- Apollo Labs#5495\n- Low-Poly Duck#9582\n- Weston Nelson#2021\n- Justus#6185\n- Akig#4036\n- 0xFendiman#3523\n- ChilidlishBambino#3301",

Modify the results of [SIP-20](https://snapshot.org/#/saddlefinance.eth/proposal/0xb492f5d360735ac4a725ce27b9444dc69527b5326756cd3a77c583a9cc722b21) to route incentives from said 4pool to the new FRAX-3pool laid out by this SIP.\n\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThis SIP seeks to deploy a pool consisting of USDT, USDC, and FRAX on both ETH mainnet and Evmos. This SIP would also see all rewards intended to head to the original 4pool, as proposed in SIP-20, head to this new FRAX-3pool instead.\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nIn the recent proposal, [SIP-21](https://snapshot.org/#/saddlefinance.eth/proposal/0xf27b07ef7025aa23edb2a84d56825511ea7adff8d6164cd09a23c63c42cdc01a), Frax agreed to permanently lock SDL in exchange for FRAX renumeration to Saddle LPs. Frax has since verbally agreed to:\n* include Saddle’s 3pool (USDC, USDT, FRAX) on Eth Mainnet and Evmos in Frax’s gauge system\n* heavily vote for and promote these gauges to maximize FXS emissions\n* pitch in bribes to veFXS holders for these pools on [pitch.money](https://pitch.money/)\n* use their permanently locked SDL to vote in Saddle gauge votes for these pools\n\nIn the interest of not fragmenting liquidity between two similar base pools via competing incentives, it would make for more efficient markets to route all incentives previously slated to support 4pool instead to 3pool.\n\n\n## **Specification**\n\nDeploy a pool consisting of USDt, USDC, and FRAX on both ETH mainnet and Evmos. Retire the currently deployed 4pool’s on both networks. Route all rewards intended for the paused 4pools to the new FRAX-3pool.\n\n**For**: Modify the results of SIP-18 and SIP-20.\n\n**Against**: No change.\n",

      "content": "## **Summary**\n\nEstablish a relationship with Diffusion Finance on Evmos via a token swap and exclusivity agreement.\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nThis SIP seeks to establish a relationship between Saddle Finance and [Diffusion Finance](https://diffusion.fi/) by means of a token swap and exclusivity agreement. The DIFF tokens received by Saddle from Diffusion will be used to incentivize Saddle’s new 4pool (USDT, USDC, FRAX, DAI) on Evmos. The SDL tokens received by Diffusion from Saddle will be used to incentivize their Evmos:FRAX pool. Both protocols will agree to an exclusivity agreement outlined below.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nDiffusion is a cutting edge AMM on the new Evmos network which facilitates swaps between ERC-20 tokens while also being plugged into the Cosmos hub via Evmos’ IBC-compatibility. Diffusion is working closely with Nomad bridge, the preferred bridging partner of both Saddle Finance and the Evmos core teams. This token swap + exclusivity agreement will bring together Saddle, Diffusion, Nomad, Evmos and Frax, by aligning incentives in the following ways:\n\n* Saddle will incentivize their 4pool (USDT, USDC, FRAX, DAI) with DIFF tokens which will drive liquidity to a) Evmos, b) Saddle, c) Nomad, and d) Frax\n* Diffusion will incentivize their FRAX:Evmos pool with SDL, which will drive liquidity to a) Evmos, b) Diffusion, c) Nomad, and d) Frax.\n* The exclusivity agreement will ensure that liquidity is not fragmented between multiple DEXs/AMMs, StableSwap providers, and bridges – a crucial requirement to ensure the efficiency and smooth user experience of the burgeoning Evmos/Cosmos DeFi ecosystem.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nDiffusion will send 225k $DIFF tokens to Saddle. Saddle will send Diffusion SDL of an equal value priced at the 7day moving average starting 1 week after the SDL token unlock.\n\nAdditionally, establish the following exclusivity agreement for 6 months between Saddle and Diffusion:\n\n* For any other DEX or AMM on Evmos, Saddle will not: incentivize poos or vaults, purchase/stake governance tokens, or otherwise integrate.\n* Diffusion will provide stableswap incentives exclusively to Saddle. For any other DEX or AMM on Evmos, Diffusion will not: incentivize poos or vaults, purchase/stake governance tokens, or otherwise integrate.\n\n**For** : Establish a partnership with Diffusion, as laid out in the specification of this SIP\n\n**Against** : No change",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis is a proposal to launch a Vesper Earn “wrapped FRAX” metapool with Saddle D4pool (FRAX, FEI, LUSD, ALUSD) to offer a first-of-its-kind yield farming stablecoin AMM.\n\n## Background\n\nVesper Finance is a DeFi super app that makes DeFi more accessible and easier to use. It offers well-audited products that simplify digital asset growth and deliver new opportunities for exposure to emerging DeFi projects and communities. The platform’s native token, VSP, incentivizes participation, facilitates governance and catalyzes user contribution.\n\nVesper Earn is a DeFi yield aggregation product that converts yield earned into a different output asset for the depositor. When users deposit to a Vesper Earn pool, they receive a pool share token that tracks their share of the pool’s total deposits. Because all yield is converted and distributed, this pool share token always reflects a 1:1 redemption with the deposit token.\n\nFor example, a user can deposit DAI to receive veDAI-ETH which entitles them to collect ETH as the deposited DAI earns yield.\n\nIn essence, Vesper Earn exists as a yield bearing wrapper for the pertinent deposit token.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThis proposal outlines a D4pool metapool for a Vesper Earn FRAX pool that pays out in Saddle D4pool. In other words this metapool will be comprised of veFRAX and Saddle D4pool LP tokens.\n\nThe Saddle AMM contract holding the veFRAX and D4pool will generate additional D4pool from the wrapped FRAX.\n\nThis means that the 50% of TVL represented by veFRAX is earning APY through Vesper. That yield is converted to D4pool to be claimed by the AMM contract itself. The claim function is public, anyone can claim on behalf of AMM, and when that happens, the additional D4pool from earned yield is injected directly into the AMM.\n\nThe veFRAX token can always be deposited and withdrawn 1:1 for FRAX. LPs benefit from yield earned on their deposits in addition to trading fees and liquidity incentives.\n\nCapital efficiency is the name of the game in AMMs, and enabling LPs to earn yield passively in addition to other incentives guarantees that the realized APY will retain an appropriate rate even if TVL vastly outpaces trading activity.\n\nAdditionally, the mechanism through which rewards are distributed creates trading volume via arbitrage, as each yield claim adds only D4pool to the metapool, making the price of the wrapped FRAX increase above $1. So arbitrageurs will profit while simultaneously maintaining the peg and increasing trading volume to this Saddle pool.\n\n## Specification\n\nVesper to create a new Earn pool of deposit FRAX, earn Saddle D4pool token.\n\nSaddle to create a new metapool for Vesper Earn FRAX via 4pool.\n\nTwo months liquidity program to start:\n\n* 10k SDL/month\n* 1k VSP/month\n\n### References:\n\nVesper Earn documentation: https://docs.vesper.finance/vesper-earn\n\nVesper App: https://app.vesper.finance/\n\n**For**: Authorize an incentivized Vesper Earn “wrapped FRAX” metapool\n\n**Against**: No change",

Passing of this SIP will allow Saddle to launch on Evmos and ETH mainnet with an incentivized 4pool consisting of USDC, USDT, FRAX, DAI in lieu of a UST-4pool.\n\n*Note: The 4pool deployed on ETH mainnet would not be replacing the well established ‘[SaddleUSDPoolV2](https://blog.saddle.finance/launching-v2-of-the-saddle-3pool/)’.*\n\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nFollowing the industry wide disruption caused by the depegging of UST, it would be irresponsible to enact SIP-15 as-is. The suggested modification would allow Saddle to maintain a healthy presence, and bring the now battle-tested FRAX to center stage.\n\nDeFi evolves fast and in order to remain competitive, a protocol needs to adapt just as fast. The original motivation for SIP-9, and SIP-15, stand– Evmos will mark the first major foray into EVM-compatible, IBC-enabled blockchains, allowing it to serve as an intersection between the fledgling Cosmos ecosystem, and the well established DeFi landscape of Ethereum.\n\nA FRAX-DAI 4pool in particular would provide a solid foundation for stablecoin based DeFi. This composition is a healthy balance between centralized, and decentralized stablecoins– all of which have proved to have resilient pegs.\n\n\n\n## **Specification**\n\nDeploy a 4pool consisting of USDC / USDT / FRAX / DAI to Evmos and ETH mainnet– using [Nomad](https://app.nomad.xyz/) to bridge ETH-native versions of USDC, USDT, FRAX, and DAI to Evmos. 2.5m SDL will be emitted over the course of 2 months, for both the Evmos 4pool and the ETH mainnet 4pool.\n\nThe first several weeks of SDL tokens will be distributed as a non-transferable asset using Mini-Chef staking contracts. Post token unlock, Mini-Chef contracts will be swapped out for the gauge system outlined in [SIP-8](https://snapshot.org/#/saddlefinance.eth/proposal/0x39d35717275a8d288763c3ed9a6c660fce59099fc519e507111627f722a767a2).\n\nSaddle will provide 500k SDL for the Evmos 4pool and 2m SDL for the ETH mainnet 4pool over the course of 2 months.\n\n\n\n**For**: Modify the results of SIP-15 in favor of an incentivized 4pool consisting of USDC / USDT / FRAX / DAI on Evmos and ETH mainnet, and cancel UST 4pool deployments. 500k SDL for the Evmos 4pool and 2m SDL for the Eth mainnet emitted over the course of 2 months.\n\n**Against**: No change.\n",

      "content": "## **Summary**\nDeploy Saddle 2pool (USDC + USDT) to Kava testnet and mainnet-- If Frax and Terra agree to provide additional incentives, launch with 4pool instead.\n\n## **Motivation**\nKava is a IBC-enabled blockchain, currently with over $600m in TVL, and with a market cap of over $730m. In May the Kava team will launch a new EVM compatible blockchain, utilizing the same validators as the IBC-enabled chain. As a part of this new EVM-compatible chain, Kava has two programs to incentivize protocol deployments. Saddle stands to gain from a deployment by acquiring:\n\nOur pro-rata share of 100k Kava incentives if Saddle deploys before mainnet launch as a part of Kava’s Pioneer Program, and\nOur pro-rata share of the $750m developer fund paid out to the top 100 protocols by TVL over 4 years as a part of the Kava Rise program.\nDiscussions with the team have informed us that there are currently no other StableSwap providers planning to deploy to Kava. Furthermore, both rewards will help attract liquidity without the need to emit extra SDL tokens. This provides a unique asymmetric opportunity for Saddle to attract new liquidity with little risk of SDL emissions.\n\n## **Specification**\nDeploy Saddle to Kava testnet and mainnet initially with 2pool (USDC + USDT) using the Kava incentives from both the Pioneer and Rise programs to incentivize liquidity. A further governance proposal to deploy SDL emissions on top of Kava incentives may follow pending an assessment of the success of the EVM-compatible Kava blockchain.\n\n**For**: Deploy Saddle to Kava’s EVM-compatible testnet and mainnet, with 2pool and Kava incentives-- If Frax and Terra agree to provide additional incentives, launch with 4pool instead.\n\n**Against**: No change.",

      "title": "SIP-12: Saddle x Perp Partnership — Token Swap & Saddle LP Token Vault on Perp",
      "content": "## Summary\nBuild a partnership between Saddle and Perpetual protocol through a token swap as well as allocating SDL and PERP rewards to liquidity mining on Perp V2.\n\n## Abstract\nPerpetual Protocol (Perp) is a decentralised perpetual futures exchange that recently deployed Curie, their V2 on Optimism. V1 of Perpetual Protocol saw over $40b in volume traded on a non-incentivised basis.\n\nThis partnership brings added utility to Saddle LP tokens by allowing them to be used as collateral or as credit lent to Perpetual Protocol’s market making entity for yield. Perpetual Protocol benefits by having a partner with deep stablecoin liquidity on Optimism (a prerequisite for our multi-collateral functionality) as well as the ability to utilise interest bearing stablecoins as collateral.\n\n## Motivation\nThere is currently no dominant stableswap provider on Optimism as there largely has not been the demand for this. Additionally, there are currently few use cases for Saddle LP tokens. Increasing optionality and potentially yield for LPs increases the incentive to LP with Saddle in the first place.\n\n## Specification\nTo provide some context, we have recently published our proposal of what the next version of tokenomics of Perp looks like (Proposal: Perp V2 Tokenomics - Proposals - Perpetual Protocol 2 )\n\nAt high level, there are 2 programs that make things interesting:\n\n1. Liquidity Acquisition is a method for the new market making entity to borrow stables and other assets for the purpose of market making\n2. Liquidity Mining is a method to incentivise market makers to utilise a specific type of collateral\n\nOn Perp’s end, we would like to deepen the Saddle<>Perp relationship by aligning incentives in our liquidity mining initiatives. Specifically:\n\n1. The SDL LP token (the specific LP token(s) to be determined at a later date) vault would receive a certain amount of PERP depending on the vePERP gauge weekly vote. These incentives occur independent of the token swap.\n2. We will then swap for SDL <> PERP (i.e. SDL treasury receives PERP)\n3. Market makers who deposit and use SDL LP tokens as collateral will receive these SDL rewards in addition to PERP rewards emitted to the gauge.\n\n\n![189b0a37160c07d2ec1939b994043c247d7b3172_2_1204x790.png](ipfs://Qmd92jfwYCA4Liyv9zqV7S5zjSnR7MegR7nyoZGQgDoJ92)\n\nThe end result is that Saddle LPs will be able to get more utility out of Saddle LP tokens by being able to stack lending yields (or to simply borrow with Saddle tokens as collateral), PERP rewards, and SDL rewards.\n\n## Token Swap\nWe’d like to deepen the relationship between Perp and Saddle by proposing a $2M token swap of SDL and PERP. This swap is to be done using a 7d TWAP price found using CoinGecko and executed as soon as SDL is transferable.\n\nThe reasoning behind this is as follows:\n\n* An early token swap will allow for Saddle treasury to hold PERP which can then be locked up for vePERP and guide emissions to the Saddle vault on a weekly basis.\n* Additionally, PERP plans to utilise the SDL by distributing it to Saddle LP stakers in Perp’s vaults.\n\n## Liquidity Mining Incentives\nAs part of the liquidity mining program listed above, we propose that the Saddle treasury allocate $2M SDL to start with for liquidity mining token swap.\n\nFor: Swap $2m worth of SDL for an equal dollar amount of PERP with the intention that Perp will add a Saddle LP token vault to their gauge further incentivized with the SDL from this token swap while Saddle will stake PERP for vePERP to incentivize the Saddle LP token gauge.\n\nAgainst: No change\n",

Specifically, a pBTC/wBTC pool which could be extended later on to include other wrapped versions of BTC (i.e. renBTC, tBTC, etc).\n\n## Background\npNetwork is a decentralized cross-chain protocol currently safeguarding >$150M in TVL and supporting 12 different blockchains. We recently crossed the $1 billion mark in cross-chain volume. With the latest release of the pNetwork V2, pTokens like pBTC, become fungible across chains, meaning users will be able to move their pBTC directly across any of the supported chains without the need to go back to the Bitcoin blockchain. pBTC holders are currently providing about $30M worth of liquidity on Ethereum. But we are committed to fostering further adoption across the Ethereum mainnet ecosystem while simultaneously kicking off a liquidity mining campaign to develop liquidity on the Arbitrum ecosystem.\n\n## Motivation\nWhile our main goal is to develop liquidity and foster the adoption of pBTC, we think this is an excellent opportunity for Saddle to expand its reach with a new product and attract liquidity in a new ecosystem. Further wrapped versions of BTC can be easily added later on, in the form of meta pools or tri-pools like the ones on Saddle-Ethereum or Curve-Ethereum.\n\n## Specification\nRegarding the wBTC/pBTC pool on Ethereum, we propose a three month liquidity incentive campaign using Saddle Minichef Contracts, whereby:\n\n* Saddle provides 200,000 SDL , equalling ~2222 SDL/day.\n* pNetwork provides 50,000 PNT equalling ~555 PNT/day.\n* The incentives structure assumes a 2:1 ratio of SDL/PNT and a FDV valuation of ~$300M for Saddle.finance. 50,000 PNT are valued at roughly $32k at the current market price.\n\nRegarding the wBTC/pBTC pool on Arbitrum, there will be no incentives at the moment, but peculiar rewards can be discussed with the Saddle community later on in the future post-token unlock.\n\nFor: Create wBTC/pBTC pools on Ethereum and Arbitrum, with the Ethereum pool receiving 200,000 SDL or 2222 SDL/day, and 50,000 PNT or 555 PNT/day in liquidity mining incentives for 3 months.\nAgainst: No change",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nIncrease Amplification Coefficient in several pools, decrease in fee of Stable Coin V2 pool.\n## Abstract\n\nThis SIP would increase the Amplification Coefficient (\"A parameter\") for the alETH, BTCV2 and StablecoinV2 pools over the coming weeks following this SIP being passed. Additionally it would decrease the trading fee on the Stable Coin V2 pool to 0.03%.\nMotivation\n\nThe higher a pool's Amplification Coefficient is, the wider the range of no-or-low-slippage trades is. Lower slippage implies more competitive rates and thus more volume, which benefits both LPs and the protocol.\n\nThese pools meet the requirements of having relatively high TVLs and a well-balanced (close to perfectly evenly distributed) asset composition.\n\nWith help from nagakingg's [CurveSim](https://github.com/nagakingg/CurveSim), which simulates efficient arbitrageurs trading against pools given three months of trade volume and prices, we have found benefits for a further increase in the Amplification Coefficients in these pools.\n\nThe output of these simulations are shown here:\nalETH:\n![alETH fees](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/saddle/original/1X/5cf6edabe6d9a78c105f8c2fda2c5922c4561397.png)\n\nBTCV2:\n![BTCV2 fees](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/saddle/original/1X/0b201f611ec75e5c63a26fa4476745cb84a4adfa.png)\n\nStable CoinV2 (0.03% fee):\n![Stable CoinV2 fees](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/saddle/original/1X/b2497df0f9d6ac431cc53f7f101c6fd817d16e6b.png)\n\n## Specification\n### Overview\n\nWe propose increasing pool amplification coefficients according to the following table:\n|Pool|TVL ($)|Current A|Proposed A|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|alETH|77M|240|1000|\n|BTCV2|42M|200|2000|\n|usdV2|15M|200|3500|\n\nNote: The Amplification Coefficient goal will be set and will change as transactions occur, eventually reaching the goal set by this proposal.\nRationale\n\nWell-balanced and high-TVL pools should always move towards a higher A parameter. This will be our first \"A-update\" as mentioned in SIP3. The analysis of the benefits from changing these A-values as well as the fee for the Stable Coin V2 pool comes from the CurveSim project by nagakingg.\n\n## Abstract\nPosted by Cyneriss on [Discourse](https://www.saddle.community/t/sip-x-changes-to-pools-parameters/321)\n\n## For:\n\nIncrease the amplification coefficients of Saddle Pools in accordance with the table above over the coming weeks.

If ratified, Saddle will deploy the necessary protocol contracts to Evmos to allow users to LP for and swap with a Stablecoin Pool V2 to start.\nMotivation\n\n## Background\n\nThe Saddle core team believes the future will be decentralized across blockchains. Whether that takes the shape of a multi-chain or a cross-chain world is still to be determined. The Cosmos ecosystem is strongly positioned to capture the cross-chain market. As it currently stands, there are no major EVM-compatible chains plugged into the Cosmos ecosystem. In other words, there are no major EVM-compatible, IBC-enabled block chains. Evmos will mark the first major foray into this space and as such serves as the intersection between the burgeoning Cosmos DeFi ecosystem and the already strong and still growing Ethereum-based DeFi ecosystem.\n\nMore importantly, Evmos will usher in an era in Cosmos DeFi where multi-billion dollar stablecoin assets such as USDC, USDT, and DAI will be able to trade cross-chain assets on DEXs like Osmosis. This presents a unique opportunity for Saddle to capture the StableSwap market, the backbone of DeFi, in this growing interoperable DeFi market.\n\nFinally, this presents a unique opportunity to bring Saddle closer together with the Nomad bridge who are uniquely positioned to be the preferred bridging partner of Evmos team (https://twitter.com/EvmosOrg/status/1498388619328905218). \n\n## Specification\n\nWe plan to launch initially with a Stable V2 pool composed of the three major Ethereum based ERC-20 stablecoins USDT, USDC, and DAI all bridged using the Nomad bridge 7.\n\n\n### For: \nDeploy Saddle protocol smart contracts onto Evmos with a Stablecoin Pool V2 comprised of Nomad-bridged versions of USDC, USDT, and DAI.\n\n### Against: \nNo change.",

      "title": "SIP-8: SDL Unlock, Tokenomics, and Liquidity",
      "content": "## **Summary**\nSDL is the Saddle DAO governance token which was recently [launched](https://blog.saddle.finance/introducing-sdl/) ~3 months ago.  SDL is currently non-transferable and only used to vote on proposals for the Saddle protocol.  To ensure that all the pieces necessary for a successful protocol growth flywheel are in place, we propose:\n\n- **Tokenomics**: Introduce veSDL - Saddle's adaptation of the popular [vote escrowed (ve)](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html) tokenomics model introduced by Curve.\n- **Unlock**: Enable transfers for SDL.\n- **Liquidity**: Use Fei/Ondo's [Liquidity-as-a-Service](https://medium.com/fei-protocol/if-you-are-part-of-a-dao-or-protocol-that-wants-to-create-liquidity-for-your-token-without-f49a01f02863)  (LaaS) and a SDL/USDC [Solidly](https://solidly.exchange/) pair to offer SDL liquidity.\n\nIf passed, the community multisig will coordinate to execute each aspect of this proposal simultaneously once ready in ~1 month.\n\n## **Background**\n\n**ve Tokenomics**\nThe vote escrowed tokenomics model lets users lock their governance tokens for different lengths of time (between 1 week and 4 years) to gain voting power.  Users receive more voting power proportional to their lock duration.  Users then vote on how to distribute emission or inflation incentives to liquidity providers.\n\n**Liquidity-as-a-Service**\nLaaS allows protocols to create liquidity for governance tokens without sacrificing the treasury to create AMM pairs or unsustainable incentives for liquidity mining.  Projects deposit their token into an Ondo liquidity vault with a flexible duration, and Fei Protocol matches the deposit with an equal amount of FEI.  Both tokens are then deployed as liquidity on DEXs like Uniswap or SushiSwap.  After a predetermined duration, the Ondo vault returns all remaining FEI to Fei Protocol plus a small fixed fee, and returns all remaining governance tokens back to the protocol. The protocol keeps trading fees and assumes any impermanent loss.\n\n**Solidly**\nSolidly is a newly launched AMM on Fantom by Andre Cronje that allows low cost, near 0 slippage trades on uncorrelated or tightly correlated assets.  Saddle recently received a [ve(3,3) NFT](https://andrecronje.medium.com/ve-3-3-44466eaa088b) as part of Solidly's bootstrapping and partnered with [Solidex](https://solidexfinance.com/) for [extra benefits](https://docs.solidexfinance.com/partners/partner-program).\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nSDL was initially launched as a non-transferable governance token.  Tokenomics are a critical missing piece for bootstrapping the protocol, TVL, and volume.  There must be enough SDL liquidity to mitigate undesirable price action and negative feedback loops.\n\n## **Specification**\n\n**Tokenomics**\nSaddle's vote escrowed tokenomics implementation (veSDL) will be based on [Ribbon Finance](https://www.ribbon.finance/)'s [Ribbonomics](https://gov.ribbon.finance/t/rgp-9-ribbonomics/486) ([source code](https://github.com/ribbon-finance/ribbonomics)).  The major changes from Curve's implementation include:\n\n- Support for variable emissions rather than a fixed inflation schedule.\n- Optionality to unlock all locked SDL ahead of the max 4 year lock if governance wants to use an alternate tokenomics model.\n- A vote escrowed withdrawal penalty that allows users to unlock their veSDL early by paying a penalty that is distributed to remaining lockers pro-rata.\n- The ability for SDL stakers to delegate their boosts to other users.\n\nSaddle will deploy 6% of the token supply (60,000,000 SDL) from the community treasury over 6 months as liquidity incentives, modeled below:\n\n![SDL TVL vs. APY](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard10/uploads/saddle/original/1X/d5d6d328bfab3b6019a0b9d4597d3079bd79f8b5.png)\n\nThe emission schedule will be revisited after 6 months to allow time for price discovery.  60% of the protocol's admin fees will be distributed to veSDL holders weekly as SDL/FEI LP tokens, which will provide buy pressure for the LaaS pool.  The remaining 40% of fees will go to the community treasury to continue building protocol controlled value.  A new [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) voting strategy will be deployed to replace SDL voting with veSDL voting.\n\n**Liquidity**\n*LaaS* - The exact details of the arrangement are being worked on and will be put forth in a future Snapshot proposal prior to this proposal being implemented.\n\n*Solidly SDL/USDC* - Saddle will use its listing capabilities to launch a SDL/USDC pair and direct all its voting power to incentivize liquidity.\n\n**Future plans**\nAlthough not a part of this proposal, in the future we hope the community will investigate the following new initiatives:\n- Migrate to on-chain governance using [Compound](https://compound.finance/)'s [Governor Bravo](https://medium.com/tally-blog/understanding-governor-bravo-69b06f1875da) or [SafeSnap](https://docs.snapshot.org/plugins/safesnap).\n- Explore using [Tokemak](https://www.tokemak.xyz/) to provide more SDL liquidity.\n- Introduce a new gauge type that allows users to lock LP tokens for an extra yield boost (based on [Frax](https://frax.finance/)'s [LP Boosts](https://docs.frax.finance/vefxs/gauge#vefxs-boosts-and-locked-lp-boosts)).\n- Issue bonds via [Olympus Pro](https://www.olympusdao.finance/pro) to buy and deploy more protocol owned value.\n- Launch borrowing against LP tokens and leveraged yield farming using [Rari Capital](https://rari.capital/)'s [Fuse](https://app.rari.capital/fuse).\n- Collect airdrops and admin fees from select [SEMPI](https://blog.saddle.finance/announcing-project-sempi/) partner protocols.\n\nMany thanks to the Curve, Ribbon, and Balancer teams for their open-source contributions to the space!\n\n### For: \nExecute the SDL unlock, tokenomics, and liquidity plan detailed above.\n\n### Against: \nNo change.",

      "title": "SIP-6: Enter into partnership with Solidex",
      "content": "Authors: @CXGonzalez\n\n### Simple Summary\n\nProposal to partner with Solidex by providing our ve(3,3) NFT in exchange for tokens which serve as a fractionalized representation of the NFT in addition to governance and vote locking power over Solidex thus ensuring long term treasury revenue growth.\n\n### Abstract\n\n[Solidex](https://medium.com/@solidsex/bootstrapping-solidex-with-sex-partners-4e78dce7c9b) is a Convex-like protocol built on top of Solidly. In exchange for permanently depositing our ve(3,3) NFT with Solidex, we are able to fractionalize our ability to boost rewards from providing liquidity on Solidly. We receive additional benefits such as vote power, the ability to stake for further rewards, and the ability to bribe for even more rewards.\n\n### Specification\n\nIn exchange for our veSOLID NFT, Saddle will receive SOLIDsex tokens which represent the underlying NFT. This enables us to:\n\n* Effectively factionalize our veSOLID NFT. SOLIDsex tokens could either be distributed among community members or used by the Saddle to accumulate more SEX tokens depending on how Saddle sees fit\n* Earn more fees from the Solidly protocol\n\nBy opting to join as SEX partner protocol, we therefore become one of the few protocols which share at least 10% of the entire SEX token supply. If more than 10 partners join, this number changes to 15%.\n\nThe solidSEX token will allow partners such as Saddle to votelock our solidSEX tokens in exchange for boosted revenue. On top of boosted revenue from LPing, partners such as Saddle will receive:\n\n* Voting power\n* Trading fees + 3rd party incentives\n* Bribes from the pools we vote for\n* ve(3,3) emissions in the form of SOLIDsex\n* 5% of all SOLID farmed as SOLIDsex\n\nSaddle would therefore immediately benefit by receiving SOLIDsex tokens which we can distribute, stake, or LP for further SOLID and SEX emissions. Long term, Saddle would have powerful voting rights over Solidex which would allow us to earn increased fees, bribes, and SOLIDsex tokens (which can be staked for SOLID and SEX rewards).\n\n### Motivation & Rationale\n\nWith the Saddle token launch on the horizon, we want to maximize the value of the token for future holders. In light motivation along with the recent explosion of DeFi on the Fantom ecosystem and the much anticipated ve(3,3) launch, we believe the best way to position ourselves for maximum value capture is to partner with Solidex.\n\nThe thinking is that, within the space of all possible partnerships (particularly in the Fantom ecosystem), the most bang for our buck lies in getting a stake in votelocking protocols. The ve(3,3) NFT Saddle has recently acquired presents us a unique opportunity therefore to lock in votelocking power on Solidex, a protocol vouched for by multiple major DeFi devs and players.\n\nThe votelocking power we would secure would allow the Saddle team to provide liquidity on Solidly and earn boosted yields thus increasing the TVL of Saddle. An increase in Saddle’s TVL is, of course, beneficial to future SDL token holders as not only does this increase the reach of governance decisions but a larger TVL increases the amount of downstream benefits the protocol can provide SDL token holders once more specific tokenomics are set in stone in the upcoming months.\n\nWe believe that partnering with Solidex is the most beneficial partner relative to any other potential Solidex competitors because of the synergies between Solidly and Solidex. By virtue of being developed by the same team behind Solidly, Solidex stands to benefit from perceived legitimacy compared to any possible competitors developed by a 3rd party. Furthermore, Solidex will benefit from first mover advantage and in a game of network effects, this makes a world of difference.\n\nWe would also join in good company as the Fantom DeFi community respected veDAO has also [recently opted](https://forum.vedao.io/t/voting-vip5-enter-into-partnership-with-solidex/50) to join in the same arrangement.\n\nIn summation, approving SIP-6 means getting ahead of the curve via fractionalization to have the option to either stake, boost, distribute or partially sell the ability to have strong governance power to members of the Saddle community.",

      "title": "SIP-5: $USDs - ArbUSD Metapool V2",
      "content": "Authors: @Tshaw\n\nHey everyone! This is Alec Shaw from app.sperax.io core team. I’d like to propose an SIP for your consideration below:\n\n## **Summary**\n\nSperax proposes a new Metapool on Arbitrum that includes $USDs. The resulting vault would be $USDs - ArbUSD Metapool V2.\n\n## **Background**\n\nThe stablecoin, $USDs, is 100% on-chain, collateralized partially by explicit collateral and partially by the protocol's ability to mint $1 worth of $SPA when users redeem $USDs. This allows for USDs to operate like $DAI during market contraction and $UST during market expansion. \n\nUnlike other hybrid stablecoins, $USDs has an auto-yield feature built in. Without having to stake, yield generated from curve trading fees + CRV is used to buy back more $USDs. This new $USDs is rebased back to the holder. \n\nSperaxUSD launched its first incentivized pool on Uniswap on January 17th. This is the first of many liquidity programs to be launched in the Arbitrum ecosystem. We want the next incentivized pool to be a Saddle Metapool. \n\n## **Motivation**\n\nSaddle is the natural next step for $USDs growth on Arbitrum. Adding a $USDs Metapool will provide the additional incentive for users to mint $USDs. By forming the Arbitrum $USDs metapool, we can align our communities by pooling resources together. This will deliver better incentives, align community incentives, enable deep liquidity, and pave the way for future products and collaborations.   \n\n## **Specification**\n\nSix Month Liquidity Incentive Campaign Using Saddle Minichef Contracts:\n\n* Saddle provides 3,479,339 $SDL , equalling 19k $SDL/day.\n\n*  Sperax provides 20,000,000 $SPA , equalling 111,111 $SPA/day.\n\n**For**: Launch the Arbitrum USDs MetaPool with SDL incentives, list metapool on [saddle.finance](https://saddle.exchange/#/pools).\n\n**Against**: No change.",

Syndicate term length is 1 year.\n# -= The multisig will have the following “territories” (i.e. powers / responsibilities / objectives) =-\n- Lead and collaborate on initiatives for growing, identifying, or rewarding engaged Saddle community members\n- Identifying rising leaders in the community and matching them with opportunities for participation in Project Delos (including yet-to-be-created syndicates and territories), bounties4bandits, Saddle Creators, and future community-oriented initiatives.\n- Deploying Delos HQ grant funds to facilitate above efforts (1 million SDL to start).\n# -= How Do Syndicate Elections Work? =-\n1. SDL Token holders will vote on Snapshot. This vote is a Weighted vote that allows you to vote for multiple candidates. Each voter may spread their voting power across any number of choices.\n2. Top 7 individuals with the most votes will be elected to Delos HQ. \n3. Ties on the token holder snapshots will be determined by separate Discord-based votes.\n4. There will be SDL token grants for all individuals elected to Delos HQ to compensate these community members for their time and contributions. Grant size will be determined and approved by SDL token holders as an early proposal.\n5. SDL token holders may put up a vote to remove syndicate members from Delos HQ if necessary before the 1 year term is up and are responsible for electing future syndicate members.\n\nMembers of Delos HQ will play a crucial role in the growth and success of the greater Saddle DAO. These members will be the well that nourishes; the lighthouse that seeks and finds; the genesis syndicate from which a whole metaverse will sprout.\n \n# Candidates\n\nTo read the nominee’s posts please visit [this forum post](https://www.saddle.community/t/delos-hq-election-nominations/84) and search the nominees by name.\n\n- PhiMarHal\n- Rach.el\n- Apollo Labs\n- Nikitakle\n- Low-Poly Duck (0xDuck)\n- ansvier\n- HammeIAm\n- Emac\n- flakes\n- Kay Lee",

      "content": "Authors: @hammeiam\n\n## Summary\n\nIncrease Amplification Coefficient in several pools\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis SIP would increase the Amplification Coefficient (“A parameter”) for the alETH, BTCV2, D4, and usdV2 pools linearly over the two weeks following this SIP being passed.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe higher a pool’s Amplification Coefficient is, the wider the range of no-or-low-slippage trades is. Lower slippage implies more competitive rates and thus more volume, which benefits both LPs and the protocol.\n\nThese pools meet the requirements of having relatively high TVLs and a well-balanced (close to perfectly evenly distributed) asset composition.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nWe propose increasing pool amplification coefficients according to the following table:\n\n|Pool|TVL ($)|Current A|Proposed A|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|alETH|77M|120|240|\n|BTCV2|42M|200|400|\n|D4|50M|120|240|\n|usdV2|15M|200|400|\n\nNote: The Amplification Coefficient can only be increased up to 2x per transaction (enforced by contract code), and each increase will occur linearly over at least two weeks.\n\n### Rationale\n\nWell-balanced and high-TVL pools should always move towards a higher A parameter. We anticipate regularly creating \"A-update\" proposals like this one to ensure that Saddle continues to offer competitive, low-slippage swap rates.\n\n## For:\n\nIncrease the amplification coefficients of Saddle Pools in accordance with the table above over a period of ~2 weeks.\n\n## Against:\n\nNo change\n",

      "title": "SIP-1: Arbitrum Frax Pool",
      "content": "Authors: @samkazemian\n\n## **Summary**\n\nWe propose a new Saddle pool on Arbitrum that consists of the following stablecoins: FRAX, USDC, and USDT.\n\n## **Background**\n\n**Frax**\n\nFrax is the first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol. Frax is open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain – currently implemented on Ethereum and other chains. The end goal of the Frax protocol is to provide a highly scalable, decentralized, algorithmic money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like BTC.\n\nFrax has an advanced Algorithmic Market Operations Controller (AMO), which allows FRAX to expand and contract the supply of FRAX by minting FRAX into liquidity pools and withdrawing and burning from them. This allows them to safely grow the supply when it is warranted, and also to shrink the supply when off peg. This is a powerful lever at their disposal that can also benefit the other stablecoins in this pool. If FRAX is on peg, they could mint it into the Arbitrum Frax pool, and such an action would cause the other tokens to trade at a premium to it. So when FRAX grows, so do its counterparts in the pool.\n\n**Synapse**\n\nSynapse is a cross-chain layer ∞ protocol powering frictionless interoperability between blockchains. By providing decentralized, permissionless transactions between any L1, sidechain, or L2 ecosystem, Synapse powers integral blockchain activities such as asset transfers, swaps, and generalized messaging with cross-chain functionality - and in so doing enables new primitives based off of its cross-chain architecture. Synapse is a bridging partner of Frax.\n\n## **Motivation**\n\nBy forming the Arbitrum Frax pool, we can pool our resources together to offer better incentives, deep liquidity, and pave the way for future collaborations.\n\n## **Specification**\n\nWe propose using the FRAX gauge farming contracts that support locking LP tokens for an extra boost to keep people long term aligned. This has worked really well for the Saddle D4 pool and a breakthrough in sustainable farming. We propose an initial A of 200 with standard 4 BPS fees (0 admin fees), and that 100% of SDL incentive emmissions on Arbitrum are redirected to this pool.\n\n$FRAX and $SYN incentives will be added as well, pending approval by each protocol’s governance. In the future, Frax will also launch an AMO for this pool.\n\n**For**: Launch the Arbitrum Frax Pool and redirect SDL incentives.\n\n**Against**: No change.",
