All scenes were independently recorded in that same year, but the project was not completed. Now, in 2024, we are resuming efforts to fulfill this dream and record the Ode for the second time from scratch.\n\nThrough a film, photographs, art, classical painting, street art (pixo), music, and narratives, \"Ode to Skate\" aims to reveal the challenges and love present in the skateboarding scene, encouraging discussions and exploring various other areas of life, connecting them to the skateboarding universe. In the future, we plan a grand launch event, including Best Trick, a photo exhibition, a party with the musicians who created the music and soundtrack, and the premiere of the short film.\n\nCurrently, we are in the process of developing the photos and the film, which explores profound themes such as freedom, work, desire, childhood, speech, art, introspection, community, expectation, and frustration. This film delves into the skateboarding universe in a unique way, bringing to light the complexities of growth and the quest for a connection with our inner child.\n\n## Synopsis\n\"Ode to Skate\" delves into the emotional journey of a skateboarder named Gui, who faces the challenges inherent in the process of growth. The film addresses themes such as the Peter Pan syndrome, anxiety, and the struggle against expectations that can lead to frustration. Gui, our protagonist, finds himself confronted with the responsibilities of adulthood while trying to balance his work and his passion for skateboarding. Throughout the journey, he discovers the importance of community and authenticity, with friends playing crucial roles in his transformation. The film celebrates life, art, freedom, and the quest for true essence.\n\nThe film aims to immerse itself in the world of skateboarding, classical painting, street art (pixo), emotional journey, and community, delivering a compelling narrative that critiques the current skateboarding scene and market.\n\nIn addition to the short film, we are exploring other forms of expression, such as photography. It was through photography that Carolina, the mind behind the project, after a year of capturing unpublished images, came up with the idea of telling the story in a more dynamic way. Over these nearly 3 years, we have conducted various experiments and documented them all, concluding with the final photo session set to take place in the coming days. We are also involved in music, with Pedro producing the film's soundtrack, and we are recording a song performed by Guilherme Alves, Romero, and Janvi, three skateboarders from the cast. We are also exploring classical painting and pixo with Romero and MIA. Additionally, we are delving into art and fashion, already customizing the protagonist's clothing. The idea is to develop more clothing pieces and then head to a photography studio for the final project records.\n\n## Objetive\n**Immediate Goal:**\n\n* Clearing outstanding payments in the short film production\n* Production of art on clothing pieces. \n* Photo session to be held on March 31st.\"\n\n## Production Details:\n\nRecording Dates:  21 e 22/01,  26 e 27/02 e 31/03.\nLocation: São Paulo, Brazil.\nTeam Involved: 30 technical staff and 75 cast members.\n\n## Production Costs:\n\nFood: $ 500\nTransportation: $ 300\nEquipment + Clothing + Art: $200\n\n**Estimated Total: $1,000**\n\n(The costs are mainly focused on food and transportation, considering the size of the team and cast.

      "title": "Counter-Proposal: Standardized Onboarding of Josh Lippi and Trevor Banta ",
      "content": "### **Introduction**\nThis counter-proposal is designed to ensure the onboarding of Josh Lippi and Trevor Banta aligns with the standardized practices of Gnars DAO. In keeping with our commitment to fairness and consistency, this approach respects the diversity of how members join our community, whether through purchase or other means.\n\n### **Background**\nThe original proposal suggested allocating 2 Gnar NFTs each to Josh Lippi and Trevor Banta, which diverges from our standard onboarding procedure. In the interest of maintaining a balanced and equitable approach, especially considering that some community members acquire Gnars through purchase or other individual efforts, it is important to standardize NFT allocations. This ensures that each member, regardless of their entry method, is welcomed equally.\n\n### **Proposal Details**\n\n1. **Allocation Adjustment:** \n   - Allocate 1 Gnar NFT to Josh Lippi (joshlippi.eth)\n   - Allocate 1 Gnar NFT to Trevor Banta (errorgardener.eth)\n\n2. **NFT Selection:**\n   - The specific Gnar NFTs to be allocated will be chosen based on availability and relevance, ensuring a meaningful and representative selection for both new members.\n\nAs the specific Gnar NFTs intended for allocation to Josh Lippi and Trevor Banta were not specified in the previous proposal, nor have they been pre-determined by the Gnars Community, I propose a collaborative and transparent approach to this process. To ensure fairness and community involvement, it is suggested that the proposers present their preferred Gnar NFT choices to the Community Pod. This will allow for an internal voting mechanism as a palliative measure.\n\nThe available Gnars for selection can be viewed at this link. This step will provide an opportunity for community members to have a say in the allocation process, ensuring that the NFTs chosen are in alignment with community interests and values.\n\nThis approach not only maintains transparency in the onboarding process but also reinforces the communal spirit of Gnars DAO by involving members in key decisions. It reflects our commitment to fairness and inclusivity, ensuring that all members, particularly new ones, feel valued and integrated into our community.\n\n3. **Transaction Details:**\n   - The NFT transfer will be executed from the Gnars Multisig wallet, with transaction details to be confirmed and signed off by authorized DAO members.\n\n### **Justification for Counter-Proposal**\nThis counter-proposal is justified by the need for a fair and consistent onboarding process. Given that Gnars are acquired by community members in various ways, including purchase, it is essential to avoid arbitrary allocations of multiple NFTs to certain individuals. This ensures that every new member, regardless of their background or contributions, is welcomed on an equal footing, maintaining the integrity and egalitarian ethos of the Gnars community.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nWe encourage the Gnars community to support this counter-proposal, which aligns with our standard onboarding practices and upholds the principles of fairness and consistency in welcoming new members.",

      "title": "Petition for Enhancing Fairness and Decentralizing Decision-Making in GNARs DAO Governance",
      "content": "#### TL;DR:\n\nPetition for our biggest holder and founder to temporarily adjust their participation in the GNARs DAO's decision-making process. \n\n### **Introduction**:\nGNARs DAO currently faces a challenge with the concentration of voting power in the hands of its largest holder. This situation has implications for the diversity and fairness of decision-making within our community. Our proposal seeks to introduce temporary measures to mitigate this issue, fostering a more balanced governance structure until we can achieve a better token distribution and enhance governance engagement.\n\n### **Problem Statement**:\nFor onChain proposals\nThe dominant voting power of the largest holder in GNARs DAO discourages participation from smaller holders, particularly due to the financial burden of gas fees associated with Ethereum-based contract voting. This diminishes the active involvement of a significant portion of our community in the governance process. Once a small holder will wait to decide if its worth to spend their money according with the biggest holder vote. With the current holders engagement a vote turnout against the biggest holder becomes almost impossible and it never occurred so far.\n\n> #### \"Yes, I will vote if I find a window of cheap gas after that big holder votes\" \n\n**In general** \nA significant concentration of voting power in the hands of the largest holder poses a challenge to the decentralized decision making sold by our brand.\n\n\n**Possible Proposed Solutions**:\n1. **Voluntary Voting Pause by the Largest Holder**: A temporary cessation of voting by the largest holder is proposed to allow for a more evenly distributed decision-making process. This measure will remain in effect until a more balanced token distribution is established.\n   or\n2. **Establishment of a Delegation Program**: To encourage wider participation and offset the impact of Ethereum gas costs, a delegation program will enable the largest holder to distribute their voting power among a broader group of community members.\n\n\n### **Implementation Plan**:\n- The Voluntary Voting Pause will involve a commitment from the largest holder, with a timeline synchronized with key milestones towards achieving equitable token distribution.\n- The Delegation Program requires a framework that ensures fair and transparent delegation processes.\n\n\n### **Impact Analysis**:\n- The Voluntary Voting Pause will immediately address the current imbalance and pave the way for more democratic participation.\n- The Delegation Program aims to mitigate the financial barriers to voting, encouraging broader community involvement.\n\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nThis proposal introduces temporary measures aimed at realigning the governance dynamics of GNARs DAO to be more inclusive and representative. Our goal is to create a governance environment that reflects the diversity and collective strength of our community until a more permanent solution can be established.\n\n### **Call to Action**:\nWe invite the members of the GNARs DAO community to engage in discussions around this proposal, offer insights, and contribute to refining these ideas. Your involvement is vital in shaping a governance structure that is truly reflective of our community's collective voice.\n\n```\n:::::     ::::::          @@@@@@@@@@@                                                               \n:::::     ::::::          @@@@@@@@@@@                                                               \n:::::     ::::::          @@@@@@@@@@@                                                               \n:::::     ::::::     @@@@@@                    @@@@@@               @@@@@@               @@@@@@     \n:::::     ::::::     @@@@@@                    @@@@@@               @@@@@@               @@@@@@     \n:::::-====------     @@@@@@    @@@@@@     @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@     @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@     @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\n:::::===========     @@@@@@    @@@@@@     @@@@@@    @@@@@@     @@@@@@    @@@@@@     @@@@@@     @@@@@\n:::::===========     @@@@@@    @@@@@@     @@@@@@    @@@@@@     @@@@@@    @@@@@@     @@@@@@     @@@@@\n::::::::::-=====          @@@@@@@@@@@     @@@@@@    @@@@@@          @@@@@@@@@@@     @@@@@@          \n::::::::::-=====          @@@@@@@@@@@     @@@@@@    @@@@@@          @@@@@@@@@@@     @@@@@@          \n::::::::::-=====          @@@@@@@@@@@     @@@@@@    @@@@@@          @@@@@@@@@@@     @@@@@@          \n```",

He is a friend of [@web-gnar](https://www.gnars.wtf/dao/proposals/11). He was recently attacked in a bar where his jaw was broken. His jaw is wired shut and he can not work for 2 months. This man does not come from money and his folks have created a Go-Fund-Me to help them take care of Grady. Grady rips at skateboarding and works a full time job to support his life.\n\nThe dude is between a rock and a hard spot and needs a fresh start. \n\nThis proposal aims to make  Gnars Dao a donor to his Go Fund Me,  involving @web-gnar making a Go-Fund-Me account with the name: GNARS DAO. The funds would be sent to @web-gnar-- who would then, send them to Grady's Go-Fund-Me.\n\n\n---\nProposal for Gnars Dao to aid him with 600 USD, and become the top donor in his Go-Fund-Me. \n---\n\n### [GoFund Me Link](https://www.gofundme.com/f/grady-moquin-extremely-difficult-next-few-months?utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet&utm_medium=copy_link_all&utm_source=customer)\n\n![Screenshot 2023-12-03 at 3.00.14 PM](https://ipfs.skatehive.app/ipfs/QmZ2vxYwY1cfPaSSXERGnLQ1n4MfEQMS1ygVmQGwCKRim1?pinataGatewayToken=nxHSFa1jQsiF7IHeXWH-gXCY3LDLlZ7Run3aZXZc8DRCfQz4J4a94z9DmVftXyFE)\n\n> As some of you may know Grady was recently part of a terrible and unjustifiable incident that took place at [Skardas bar](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Skarda's+Bar/@44.9250091,-93.1306714,3a,48.6y,125.41h,85.65t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sdNxo987rmZjsNY2jfeMEiA!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m7!3m6!1s0x87f62afb837d15ad:0x794dc017682ee687!8m2!3d44.924874!4d-93.1304755!10e5!16s%2Fg%2F1hc1pgyh9?entry=ttu) this past week. Long story short, we all were playing pool and Grady was asking this guy to move so we could finish the game. He didnt seem to want to listen so Grady told him again, which after that, things got a little heated and he decided to mock Grady saying the \"n-word\" as well(keep in mind he is caucasian and was mocking Grady) So we decided to grab the bartender to get him kicked out due to his hostility and racial unnecessary slurs. This is where it gets worse. This guy and Skardas were going back and forth he found time to sucker punch Grady in the face. GRADY was then taken to regions hospital on the 26th of November where he found out his jaw was broken in 2 places and would be needing surgery immediately. His insurance had just expired so he wouldn't be getting any help there… fast forward to now. Unfortunately his mouth is completely wired shut and Grady is out of work for 6 weeks to 2 months. I am asking for help with Gradys new liquid diet, Rent, along with some medical bills that will be stacking up. Anything would help. Especially when your everyday life changes so quick. Also I want to say thank you to everyone that has already helped and to anyone that decides to help❤️ Grady deserves to be worry free as he undergoes these next few stressful, hard months.\n\n| ![Image](https://ipfs.skatehive.app/ipfs/QmerAj76d49vePbdKgBnPZWosxXxjmZJzuyHbzNAxpCfo9?pinataGatewayToken=nxHSFa1jQsiF7IHeXWH-gXCY3LDLlZ7Run3aZXZc8DRCfQz4J4a94z9DmVftXyFE) | ![18236_900](https://ipfs.skatehive.app/ipfs/QmYZij8WgHBQm6N2nYrLTXRhZJDAaP1k9uoBMzPq1xbNfe?pinataGatewayToken=nxHSFa1jQsiF7IHeXWH-gXCY3LDLlZ7Run3aZXZc8DRCfQz4J4a94z9DmVftXyFE) |\n|-|-|\n\nYou can find more of his skate content on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=grady+moquin).\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgFwnFlYPAc&t=4s\n\n---\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oetkUVptgzg\n\n---\n\n ![](https://ipfs.skatehive.app/ipfs/QmXApJ2FjyaQ9K5M3yEwoEgwzzMkFjT2byrPUU8autUiyH?pinataGatewayToken=nxHSFa1jQsiF7IHeXWH-gXCY3LDLlZ7Run3aZXZc8DRCfQz4J4a94z9DmVftXyFE)\n\n---\nI think this would be a legendary move by Gnars Dao that would make waves among the Minnesota skate scene.\n\n![Image](https://ipfs.skatehive.app/ipfs/QmXEW8yuaqfjz9PEF9eRgPb12nVPadf8xDMsZuHzQFGDr3?pinataGatewayToken=nxHSFa1jQsiF7IHeXWH-gXCY3LDLlZ7Run3aZXZc8DRCfQz4J4a94z9DmVftXyFE)\n\n\n--- \n\nVOTE YES to send 0.3 ETH from the MultiSig \n\nVOTE NO to do nothing\n\n---",

      "content": "About me; Surtrip Proposal to Espírito Santo, Regência; Content Production; Utilization of Funds\n\n**About Me**\n\nAloha guys, I'm Luiza Coutinho, a 27-year-old Brazilian. I am the founder of Langai, the first women's surf shop and the largest women's surf community in Brazil. My mission is to inspire women to surf, empower them, and contribute to a better world.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByaPS9Gah.jpg)\n\n\nI embarked on my surfing journey in 2013 and quickly realized that, much like in other sports, the surfing realm was predominantly male-dominated. Women lacked genuine representation and often received little encouragement to start or continue surfing on Brazil. Conversely, surfing brought a transformative impact to my life, allowing me to connect with nature, cherish unique moments, embrace a simpler and more meaningful existence, find tranquility amid life's chaos, forge new connections, and explore novel places and waves.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryWYrqGan.jpg)\n\nWith the vision of attracting more women to surfing through content creation, fostering a women's community, and advocating for ocean protection, I established Langai. Today, I am fully immersed in the world of surfing, dedicated to elevating the global presence of women in the water and encouraging them to lead more sustainable and balanced lives.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1goS5Gah.jpg)\n\nI extend an invitation to all women to take a break, challenge themselves in formidable conditions, and thrive within barrels – proving that women belong there too. I have been an active participant in Gnars DAO since the beginning of 2023, even earning my first NFT through Onboarding, thereby becoming a part of the GNARS community.\n\n**Travel Grant Proposal: Surf Trip to Espírito Santo, Regência.**\n\nI'm on a month-long journey across Espírito Santo and I am eager to further promote GNARS through diverse web2, web3, and in-person channels.\n\n**About Regência, Espírito Santo:**\n\n* The enchanting village of Regência, also known as Regência Augusta, is situated at the mouth of the Doce River.\n* Home to one of Brazil's premier tubular waves.\n* Boasting a unique, desert-like, rustic ambiance.\n* In addition to surfing, this haven offers opportunities for Hawaiian canoe rides, stand-up paddleboarding, witnessing mesmerizing sunsets, engaging in nature trails, and exploring the region's myriad attractions.\n\nI am venturing into a realm of towering waves, rich history, and boundless experiences.\n\n**A Journey of Empowerment and Female Surf Advocacy**\n\nEven today, sharing tubular waters with fellow women remains a rarity. My aspiration is to cast a feminine, inspiring gaze upon the \"Land of Tubes\" – sharing challenges, triumphs, and inspiration across social media platforms in a truly Gnarly manner.\n\nRegência presents an ideal arena for personal growth, nature immersion, and outdoor living.\n\n**And in moments when Regência's waves rest?**\n\nBeyond the tubes, my goal is to fully explore the region, embracing the village's offerings while maintaining a strong connection to the sea. \n\nActivities will include stand-up paddleboarding, wing foiling, surf foiling, and beyond – with the entire Espírito Santo coastline available to explore during less favorable surf conditions. The state's rocky banks consistently churn out towering waves untouched by human presence.\n\n**Why would you support me through GNARS DAO?**\n\n* Just as I once longed for more women in the lineup when I began surfing in 2013, today I yearn for more female surfers in GNARS and the realm of Web 3. I firmly believe that I am the right person to bridge the gap between women in the surfing community and GNARS here in Brazil.\n* I will introduce GNARS to my audience by highlighting how I secured sponsorship. I will foster greater awareness and credibility within Brazil's female surfing community bringing new users.\n* Coverage across Surfguru's website and social media channels, the nation's leading wave forecasting site and a GNARS collaborator.\n\nThis expedition seamlessly aligns with GNARS DAO's essence, inspiring fellow women to conquer larger, tubular waves. Furthermore, it offers an avenue to acquaint my audience with the realms of GNARS and Web 3.\n\n**Practical Contributions to GNARS DAO:**\n\n* Brand placement on surfboards stickers.\n* 1 informative reels post on Instagram (@langaibr), explaining what is GNARS with the Langai community.\n* A trilogy of Instagram stories (@langaibr), leading followers to the reels post that explains GNARS.\n* 2 posts per week (photos/reels) on Instagram (@langaibr), featuring surfing imagery and tagging @thatsgnar.ly, @gnarsdao, @nounish, @nounsbr, and incorporating #thatsgnarly, #GnarsWaves, and #GnarsDAO hashtags.\n* 2 posts per week will be contributed to Surfguru DAO.\n* A release on the Surfguru platform will spotlight the journey and GNARS DAO sponsorship.\n* A release on SurfHive with the journey and GNARS DAO sponsorship.\n\n**How Will I Allocate GNARS Funds?**\n\nThe GNARS funds will support travel costs and content creation, including jet ski sessions and a filmmaker. Below, I outline specific costs to offer a comprehensive view of how this collaboration could invigorate both me and the propagation of GNARLY philosophy across Brazil.\n\n**Travel Duration:**\n1 month and 7 days | From 04/08 to 08/09\n\nMy request entails a travel grant of 1 ETH to alleviate travel-related expenditures. My current budget allocation is as follows:\n\n$250 USD - Fuel and tolls from Rio de Janeiro to Espírito Santo.\n$400 USD - Accommodation and meals.\n$500 USD - Videographers/photographers for the expedition.\n$500 USD - Jet ski sessions during the journey.\n\nThank you for considering my proposal and contributing to this meaningful endeavor. Together, we can amplify the presence of women in the world of surfing and embrace the GNARLY spirit!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ8Is2GTh.jpg)",

      "content": "![]![](https://i.imgur.com/boT4gbw.png)\nThis photo reminds of the Wavehead NFT that I got  when joined gnars :)\nFrom my previous surftrip to Fernando de Noronha\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pBcFRGo.png)\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**Travel grant proposal: Surftrip to Indonesia | 2 ETH**\n\nIntro; Highlights from previous sponsorship term; Surtrip proposal to Indonesia; Content production; Use of funds\n\n## **About me**\n\nAloha guys, I am Luiz Hadad, brazilian, 33 years old, surf since I am a little kid and have been a [Gnars sponsored freesurfer since September 2022](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0x4b0fef8be71a1beae3d7d2b31d44ee2df2ca539b36aa66a8221b346f6a713c4a).\n\nMy initial goal was to do a prop to renew my sponsorship, but since we're on a transition period and my trip is starting in two weeks, I spoke with @xvlad , @knowhow , @willdias and few other community members and we thought that proposing a travel grant would be the best way to keep building the Shredders Journey.\n\nI've been on the blockchain world since 2017, working as a community builder in different projects, such as  [Cambiatus](https://www.cambiatus.com/) and [SurfHive](https://www.peakd.com/c/hive-141964/created). I also participate as an advisor at [Ethereum Brasil](https://www.ethereumbrasil.com/) and [Play4Change](https://www.play4change.io/).\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyzY79tN3.jpg)\nLucas Rocha (@lrocha94), Myself, Mari (@marinioac), Gibson (@3rdeye_crypto) and Vlad (@xvlad) at the Gnars Session during Ethereum Rio 2023.\n\n\nWhen I got into crypto, I was able to have flexible working hours and dedicate myself to my biggest passion: spend time in the ocean chasing swells and surfing big barrels - as you can see on my https://thatsgnar.ly/luizhadad profile.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJDnC9dun.jpg)\nPicture from my last time visiting Macaronis Resort\n\nI am a partner and advisor at [Surfguru](https://www.surfguru.com.br), Brazil's biggest online surfing community and forecast website, with 300k unique users and 2.5M visits per month. I co-lead the web3 movement there with @marinioac and @crisciacm. We recently launched [Surfguru DAO](https://thatsgnar.ly/surfguru) in collab with Thats Gnarly and approved a prop with Gnars [to create educational content, help onboard surfers that can be NFT holders or shredders and raise awareness about Gnars. ](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0x9e670758685c096b923e0b9fa65e2e9cd44906983ea78fe73d750d77be7c568c)\n\n\nIn 2022 we launched [SurfHive](https://www.peakd.com/c/hive-141964/created), a community inspired by [SkateHive](https://peakd.com/c/hive-173115/created) (special thanks to Vlad and the SkateHive crew) and [Surflimpo](https://www.cambiatus.com/surflimpo), a social currency that incentivize people [taking care of the oceans and participating in beach cleanups](https://surflimpo.cambiatus.io/invite/5w2AoW). \n\n\n\n\nFrom September 2022 until March 2023 I was able to do many things related to @Gnars.  In my original proposal I commited to: \n\n\"My focus will be on producing content and representing gnars in different events - from beach cleanups to web3 events.\n\nSurfguru.com.br will also be a partner in this iniciative, sharing news, reposting content on social media, and raising awareness about gnars in any other ways we can think about.\n\nI’ll get stickers to put on my board and all the other avaliable merch to represent gnars anywhere I go.\"\n\nDuring this 6 months, I believe I acomplished the proposed goals, as you can see on [my sponsorship report](https://peakd.com/hive-141964/@luizhadad/6-months-as-a-sponsored-surfer-at-gnars-dao-or-6-meses-como-um-surfista-patrocinado-da-gnars-en-pt-br).  I'd love to keep collaborating with Gnars as a sponsored surfer. Since we're still buiding the [Gnarthlete Journey](https://discord.com/channels/928811922244137020/1118918402472411266/1118918402472411266)\n\nHere goes few highlights from the report:\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Skvt1ZVI3.jpg)\n- Creating surfing content in gnarly waves, such as slabs and barrels, in Espirito Santo and Fernando de Noronha; This content became part of few Gnars videos, including the first surfing/water sports mint on That's Gnarly and the first surfing collab mint too;\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJFokZVIh.jpg)\n\n- Spreading the word about Gnars as a speaker during the Ethereum Rio Conference and 3 meetups at WeBelieve Hub;\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkaTkbV8n.jpg)\n- Running a DAO Governance Workshop at Ethereum Rio and having Gnars as one of the cases;\n\n\n\n- Onboarding Mari, Lucas Rocha, Bernardo Nassar, Carlos Bellumat, Criscia, Gabriel Sodré, João Parmagiani, Felipe and Gabriel Carvalho amongst others to our community; \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryTbl-V83.png)\n\n- Growing SurfHive and fostering the community, that now can generate a small revenue to Gnars - every Gnars member can choose Gnars as a default beneficiary, and the DAO will earn at least 5% of the post's rewards;\n\n- Helping close partnerships that bring benefits for Gnars holders:  \n    - [Surfguru](https://surfguru.com.br/) - 1 year subscription for all Gnars holders with +2 NFTs and 90 days subscription for all holders.\n    - [We Believe Hub](https://webelieve.com.br/) gnars holders can work there 2x a week for free\n  \n    \n\n## **Travel grant proposal: Surftrip to Indonesia**\n\nIndonesia is a dream for every surfer. It has perfect waves, beautiful islands, awesome parties, lots of fun and plenty of opportunities to spread the word about Gnars.\n\nWith the travel grant, I commit to **continue** as a Gnars surfer travelling in indo with: \n\n- Gnars logo at the top of my board, along with Surfguru as my major sponsors;\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HynzWWEUn.jpg)\n\n- Gnars mention on every social media post related to the trip  - also @thatsgnar.ly, @nounish, @nounsbr and #GnarsWaves #GnarsDAO and #NounsWaves hashtags\n- Noggles on my web2 and web3 profile names ⌐◨-◨  (They're already on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/luizhadad) and [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/luizhadad))\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ4Alr483.jpg)\n\n- Wearing Gnars gear (hats, shirts, glasses, POAP) during the trip;\n\n**On the web3 content side** I can commit to post at least once a week a blog post on SurfHive and submit two creations on That's Gnarly.\n\nOver 2 months (8 weeks), that would mean:\n- **8 posts on SurfHive + 16 submissions on That's Gnarly**\n\nI'd like to contribute with 20% of my earnings on SurfHive to Gnars. There, I can set Gnars as a default beneficiary. I am curious of how much this will be after the surftrip.\n\n\n**Regarding **web2 content**, my deliverables will be:**\n\n- Two web2 surfing post per week (minimum) on Instagram mentioning and tagging Gnars, That's Gnarly, SurfHive, Nounish, NounsBr; **That equals 16 posts.** \n- Stay active on instagram stories creating content about the trip and relating to gnars / web3\n\n- Put nounish stickers all over the place ⌐◨-◨ \n- Foster partnerships with local business, like Bagus Ink Surf Camp, that our friend Ricky onboarded to Gnars.\n\n\n**Planned surfing schedule for the trip:**\n\n**From July 9th until August 31st:**\n- Two months in Indonesia: few days in Bali (10th until the 13th of July), from 14th July until 28th of July I'll be in the Mentawais at Macaronis Resort (one of the best waves in the planet). \n- I will go back to Bali and keep chasing barrels during August - G-Land and Desert point are on my bucket list\n\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJL9VWNU3.jpg)\n\n**Financial proposal**\n\nMy ask is a travel grant of 2 ETH to help me with travel expenses.\n\nMy current travel budget is as it follows:\n\n1k USD - Return ticket: Brazil - Jakarta (Indonesia)\n250 USD - Return tickets from Jakarta to Bali\n300 USD - Return tickets from Bali to Padang (Mentawaii)\n150 USD - Hotel + food in Bali for the first days (July 10th until July 13th)\n3k USD - Cost of Macaronis Resort for 2 weeks ($200 per day + transfers)\n500 USD - Hotel in Bali / Desert Point in August\n500 USD - Videomakers/photographers for the trip\n\nTotal costs: 5.650 USD\n\n2 ETH = 3.8k USD at the time of writing (1 ETH - 1.903 usd).\n\nI saved some money for this trip and I am also looking for other sponsors to help me pay for the remaining 1.8k usd from the travel costs.\n\nThanks Mari for delegating your Gnars so I could put my prop up.\n\nAlso thanks to Vlad and Gami for the continous support! You guys are legends!\n\nMahalo!\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1oEPgyq.png)\n            @luizhadad / wavehead",

      "content": "![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryWB8jQrn.jpg)\n\nHello everybody! I am **Abuga Aroni**, a downhill skateboarder from Kenya, and the homie behind [Downhill254](https://downhill254.com/).\n\nI picked up downhill skateboarding in the UK back in 2016. But when I came back to Kenya in 2017, I found I was pretty much the only downhill skater in around.\n\nThis kinda sucked, and so I spent the following years trying to grow the Kenyan downhill skate scene. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkSRDsXH2.jpg)\n\nCouple years later, and we're still only a handful but we're slowly growing. I dream of having a massive scene one day, and hopefully the seeds of stoke I plant will blossom 🌸.\n\nI'm a big believer in giving back. Over the last few years, I've been helping out beginners and novices through my [blog](https://downhill254.com/) and [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@downhill254skate). \n\nI've been creating content that helps skaters around the world get off the right (goofy or regular hehe) foot for [downhill skating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn5bk6hg_B0&list=PLDfyn8uDFYiZ-PITeT0439V5-AukFKKeK). Teaching them everything they need to know, to allow them to go from being a total beginner, to a skater that can handle any hill they come across. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryAgFsXBh.png)\n\nThe great side effect of helping new skaters, is that I've been able to  make downhill skateboarding my main source of income through content creation. \n\nAnd being a part of movements and communities like Gnars, and Skatehive couldn't be more perfect. \n",

There is great expectation that the women's park skateboarding category will bring an unprecedented medal for the country. It is the only skateboarding category in which Brazil has not won a medal.\n\nWith a collection of awards in her resume and currently ranked as the number one female professional park skateboarder in Brazil, Raicca has skateboarding running through her veins. Her history with skateboarding is long-standing and comes from her family. Raicca learned to skateboard at the age of 6 under the influence of her father and uncle, who are also skateboarders. The girl would tag along for her father's skateboarding lessons at the São Bernardo do Campo skatepark and ended up developing a passion for it.\n\n\nIn 2022, Raicca competed for the first time against the world's best in Rio de Janeiro and finished in 4th place. In 2023, she took part in the Dubai stage of the World Championship and finished in 11th place.\n\n## Whats Next \n\nRaicca was one of the first woman to drop the megaramp and certainly a great add to our Gnarly Crew. \n\nThis proposal requests Gnar 717 to onboard her to the community.\n\nWith this proposal Raicca would be recognized as Gnarthlete level 2 -> https://app.charmverse.io/gnars/page-5339523206847683). \n\n \n![Screenshot 2023-05-15 at 23.41.51.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidm2bdpqnrj24numh2kxsskvphfa7tpr42ndduuwler56bek5yyte)\n    ",

      "title": "PROPOSAL FOR FUNDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CHILDREN'S BOOK CALLED: **THE INCREDIBLE BOOK OF TRICKS**",
      "content": "> I am sponsoring this proposal for nikolaevkappa.eth \n\n\n## **Introduction**\n\nMy name is Renato Galvão a.k.a. Nikolaev \"Kappa\" and I’ve been a skateboarder since 16 yo. I'm 35 now 🧙‍♂️. I’ve worked with most big brands both in Brazil and USA and now I am focused on creating a children books called The Incredible Book of Tricks.\n\n*As a creative director and 3D animator, I could bring an engaging perspective to the books, and my background in photography could help to create beautiful and dynamic illustrations.* \n\nHere are my companies so you can see the visual aspects:\nhttp://instagram.com/obvious.cc\nhttp://instagram.com/chapadinhasdeendorfina\nhttp://instagram.com/prazerobvious\n\n*Living in a couch in Copacabana for years and spending most of my days skateboarding must have provided me with a unique perspective and a wealth of knowledge about being a skateboarder. My experience with Casa Urbana creating skateboarding content could also be a valuable asset.*\n\n*Here some of my favorites:*\n\n[[URBN] PRMTRL](https://vimeo.com/78445531)\n\n[[URBN] QUICK TRIP #1](https://vimeo.com/72244552)\n\n[[URBN] QUICK TRIP #2](https://vimeo.com/72704440)\n\n[[URBN] THIS IS MEMORY](https://vimeo.com/111691763)\n\nA **children's book** with a glossary of skateboarding tricks and their variations, along with illustrations and step-by-step instructions, could be a great resource for kids who are interested in learning more about skateboarding. In addition to teaching kids how to perform different tricks, the book could also include information about the history and culture of skateboarding, as well as profiles of famous skateboarders. By incorporating **VR assets** and **animations**, the book could provide a unique and immersive learning experience for kids. \n\nAn **NFT collection** could also be a fun way to collect and showcase different skateboarding tricks. A book like this could be a valuable resource for kids and even grown-ups who are interested in skateboarding.\n\n### **Description**\n\nParents who want their children to learn about skateboarding will be very interested in this material as well. **The book will be fully interactive. The first volume will have approximately 45 flat ground tricks explained in detail**, where they came from and how to do them. The **inclusion of augmented reality animations** will make the book even more engaging and interactive, and the hardcover format could make it more durable and long-lasting.\n\n**How does this proposal benefit the DAO?**\n> This proposal could benefit the DAO by providing a valuable digital ( and later a physical one) resource for anyone (not just kids) who are interested in learning more about skateboarding.\n> \n> The use of Noggles and Gnars from the community in the illustrations and artwork could further emphasize the connection to the Gnars community. Could be a great way to promote the Gnars and its culture to a wider audience and to engage with the community in a meaningful way. \n> \n> The idea is that **33%** of the sales of the book and the NFT collection's revenue be reverted to GNARS  treasure fund. \n\n# VISUAL EXAMPLES\n\n**Here is some more we can do:**\n\n→ The boards will have Gnars PFP from the community and Noggles stickers.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vNafOo8.jpg)\n→ One of the possibilities is to choose Gnars Visionaries from ThatsGnarly and people from the community to have your NFT to illustrate the boards.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PKn3GE4.jpg)\n\n\n→ Through the process we will have a strong visual team that will create assets to try to implement dcl emotes and GLB or GLTF formats for the community to use in metaverse and other applications. Also renders to illustrate the Gnars brand.\n\n\nAlso including a Nounish-Gnars page at the end of the book so we provide more information about the community and answer any questions that people might have. \n\nGiving the Gnars community permanent credit for their sponsorship and help to recognize and support it’s contribution to the book.\n\n**What marketing and networking opportunities are associated with this proposal?**\n\n> After having the pilot we can go to the global distribution network of the Nouns community. It could help to reach a global audience and promote the book to different bookstores in different countries. \n\n\n## **Budget and Deliverables**\n\nA timeline of six months for the completion of the book, with regular deliveries along the way, could help to ensure that the project stays on track and is completed on time.\n\n## Timeline and Deliverables\n**Week 1-2**: *Research and content development*\n\nComprehensive glossary of skateboarding tricks\nHistorical and cultural insights\n\n**Week 3-6**: *Illustrations, 3D modeling, and texturing*\n\nCharacter creation with Noggles\nApplication of Gnars from the community through the [Visionaries from **ThatsGnarly**](https://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/visionaries)\nSkateboard and clothing design\n\n**Week 7-8**: *NFT creation*\n\nNFT collection creation\n\n**Week 9-12**: *Final editing, marketing, and pilot approval*\n\nEditing and finalizing content\nMarketing and promotion\nFinal Approval\n\n### Deliverables for this project include:\n\nA fully illustrated and animated digital book pilot\nAn NFT collection with all tricks and their variations\n\n# A future proposal for printing and distribution of the physical book at NOUNS.\n\n\nThis pilot will help us test the book's potential success in the community and identify areas for improvement before we fully launch the book.\n\nDuring the pilot, we will distribute a limited number of copies of the book to select audiences in various regions. We will also gather feedback and data on the digital book's sales, readership, and engagement. Based on this information, we will refine our marketing and distribution strategies for the full launch.\n\nOnce the pilot is completed, We would like to present a new proposal to the Nouns DAO or Lil Nouns (Since the book if for kids). The proposal will outline how we can leverage the power of blockchain technology to streamline the printing and distribution process of the book worldwide. By utilizing the Nouns Ecosystem, we can ensure that the book is produced and delivered efficiently, securely, and cost-effectively.\n\nI believe that this pilot and subsequent proposal will only benefit even more the success of the Gnars DAO.\n\n## Team Budget Break out (1.5ETH)\n\n→ Skateboarders & Filmmaker with 135 Filmed Tricks - **0.5ETH**\n→ 43 Tricks 3D Animation, Lighting and Render - **1ETH**",

One of the most significant challenges we are still encountering is the high gas cost associated with deploying NFT editions on That's Gnarly. These costs have made it difficult to have a daily drops on some days, limiting our potential user base from growing.\n\nPrevious Proposal was passed to request 1 ETH for 1 month worth of drops which we have done successfully From end of February, through March and starting April: \n\n## List of Deployments + Gas Costs: \nYou can review the full 30 day breakdown of this intiative in this Wallet i setup to manage the deployment and Gas costs that sometime are encountered by Rocketman and I issue a refund:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x0aceF9ff1399bA132ad459B9d761899deb24B908&p=1\n\n## What are all the details?\n\nTo overcome this challenge, we propose to continue this initiative that will go subsidize the gas costs associated with deploying That's Gnarly Editions + Sending out That's Gnarly NFTS and Gnars NFTS to our winning Shredders and Prize winners on the Ethereum network. We have estimated the highest gas fee we have encountered during these drops is 55$ - 110$ on a high gas fee day.\n\n55$ X 30 Daily Drops ~ 1 ETH cost per month to deploy these editions (Ununsed gas fees will be carried over to next month to keep it going as long as Possible\n\n### NOTE: For Questions on this Proposal, please tag me or Rocketman in That's Gnarly Chat - as our Proposal thread area for any comments or questions. \n\n",

      "content": "![](https://i.imgur.com/MdQB4sG.jpg)\n\nI’m a professional skateboarder asking for a Gnars travel budget in this proposal. I have some skate trips coming up that I could definitely use some help funding. As one of the first Gnars athletes that’s been involved with projects before. I’m asking for a travel budget of 3 eth this spring and summer split in half with two deposits of 1.5 eth.\n\nI was one of the first athletes to do projects with Gnars. I went to New York City for NFT NYC where we filmed the gnars introductions video that we use to help on board more shredders till this day. I’ve also got to raise money for the dao with a 3 way profit split limited mint. That allows everyone to get involved and makes money for the treasury. I’d like to do more like the last one I did on Zora.  I’ve left links in the discord chat to that. That will help towards all my skateboarding travel expenses needed including gas,airfare,hotels,etc.\n\nLooking forward to a good and productive year!\n\n\n## 2023 SKATE TRIPS\n#### TRAVEL BUDGET\n* March 29th Warm Springs skatepark grand opening\n* Gas and lodging $1,000\n* https://www.instagram.com/p/CqB-l_EpJ0_/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\n* April travel to California to film content\n* Plane ticket and lodging $ 2,000\n* Can get social media clips to post on Twitter and tag Gnars.\n* Proposal for 1.5 ETH\n* I will touch back in with the next travel budget proposal for the trips listed below after looking at the returns from this one.\n* July- August Europe trip starting in Helsinki and ending in Estonia for the Simple Session contest and filming content.\n* https://linktr.ee/simplesession?fbclid=PAAaa-gvlMxx1eLOjvMRKf8Y8fhaVjtFGfTNr8IYDp5nyiOpgY3HXxy_GK1I4\n* Plane tickets and lodging $4,000\n* Proposal for 1.5 ETH\n\n## WHAT I’VE DONE FOR THE DAO\n\n* I was one of the first athletes for Gnars dao. The first proposal I was a part of was filmed and is now\n* part of the Gnars introduction video that helps onboard to dao.\n* After that I was given a travel budget that helped me produce more content and get on more trips\n* To make it to more events.\n* I noticed I was able to make more post on Twitter about Gnars.\n* We minted a photo on an iconic skate spot with a three way royalty split between me the photographer and Gnars DAO. Each profited a few hundred dollars.\n* I think we can do a lot more cool projects like that and help grow the DAO.\n* Hint I have a lot of nouns glasses stickers I plan on sticker slapping different places on my travels.\n\nThank you so much for your consideration and Look forward to Chatting about This Proposal in discord",

      "title": "Sponsor Elisa (paragliding) with 1 ETH to become an official sponsored athlete",
      "content": "Hi all,\nMy name is Elisa and you can find me in https://www.instagram.com/rio.from.above/. I have been paragliding for more than a decade and I am the current state champion in Rio de Janeiro. \nThe podium is not a stranger to me. Since my early days in paragliding I have made it to the podium several times, but usually in the female category. I have made it to the top in the world rankings in cross country flying. This season, I nailed the **1st place overall** (among men and women) in the serial category, which made me pretty happy.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1eGUL5T.jpg)\n\nAnd I want more! I want to crush records in the Brazilian Sertão and spread the word about Gnars. \n\n## A little more about me\n\nSome of my achievements in paragliding:\n\n\n- 2022 – 1st overall – Rio de Janeiro State championship (Serial category)\n- 2022 – 6th female – Panamerican ranking\n- 2022 – 5th female – World XC Contest \n- 2022 – made 3 flights of over 300 km of distance\n- 2021 – 3rd female - National championship\n- 2021 - made one flight over 300km of distance\n- 2017 – 1st female – National championship\n- 2016 – 2nd female – National championship\n\nI’m passionate about all outdoor sports. On top of paragliding, I love kitesurfing, Va’a paddling and I have been recently learning how to surf. I’m also a mother of an 8-year-old skater and a 6-year-old ballerina and they both love flying with me. **Moms rock!**\n\nMusic and technology are part of my life. My expertise is in how musicians make money from music royalties. I help develop softwares as a product owner and I participate in other DAOs, focused in the music business, such as “Water & Music” and “Música, Copyright e Tecnologia” (a Brazilian DAO about Music, Copyrights and Technology). I am also a journalist and I have lead as editor a music magazine for 11 years, organized events and social media growth for a not-for-profit music association. I write regularly for the largest Paragliding magazine in the world (Cross Country or @xcmag). \n\n\n## Raising funds and community building\n\nI have founded a community called Saia Para Voar (translated from Portuguese, it means both ‘get out and fly’ and ‘use a skirt to fly’). It became a very strong decentralized community and movement that helped women learn how to fly a paraglider, develop their skills or just socialize. We were able to gather funds and offer sponsorship for competition pilots and also made a documentary that was aired in a Brazilian TV channel called OFF (https://vimeo.com/464824633).\n\nDuring the pandemic, in the Music NGO I contributed for, I created a fund called ‘Juntos Pela Música’ and we were able to get a partnership with Spotify to double whatever funds we raised. The fund grew up to BRL 1,7 million with the help of many musicians like Alceu Valença, Djavan, Erasmo Carlos and many others. The fund was distributed among struggling musicians with periodic payments during the pandemic. To learn more: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXgUr5eD2uI&t=50s\n\n## Sponsorship proposal\n\nI would be honored to receive 1 ETH to cover part of the costs for a distance-record-breaking expedition to the northeast of Brazil (Assú - RN) and move to Level 3 to become an official Sponsored Athlete. \n\nI’m in a hybrid position as the Gnars Athlete Sponsorship Protocol has recently changed. I have been already granted with 1 Gnar to be onboarded in the community. So I assume I’m level 2 now, so the proposal would be to land on level 3 according to [this protocol](https://0xsatori.notion.site/Gnars-Athlete-Sponsorship-Protocol-7854a940f3f2461bb9d6413f76da8cf2) \n\n### :small_blue_diamond: Ojective: \nFly 400 km in a paraglider during the trade winds season (from September to November)\n\n### :small_blue_diamond: The ask: \n1 ETH to cover costs and become level 3 athlete\n\n### :small_blue_diamond: Other support: \nVideo editing for media content\n\n### :small_blue_diamond: The plan: \nSpend 12 days in the Sertão and fly as much as possible to cross the 400km barrier in a paraglider.\n\n### :small_blue_diamond: Expedition costs (estimation): \n\n\n| **Item** | **Description** | **Cost** | **Units** | **Total Cost**|\n|:--------:|:---------------:|:--------:|:---------:|:-------------:|\n|  Towing and retrieve   |  The glider is towed up at 6-7 AM and the flight is done in a straight line until the sunset.

It’s a place with very strong thermals and extreme flying conditions.

The Sertão is the Meca of cross country pilots throughout the world during the season (from September to November). \n\nI went there in 2021 and 2022 and this is where [I flew my longests flights](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWYFZNyN-gH/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link). In 2022, I was very few kilometers away from the South American record. \n\n[Watch me](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CV59fNMD6LM/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) crossing the skies above both Rio Grande do Norte and Ceará states in one 280+ Km flight in the Brazilian sertão.\n\nMy personal best is 320 km in a 10-hour flight.\n\n\n## How can I contribute to the Gnars community?\n\n- Explain Web 3.0, Gnars initiative and how buying NFTs can move this community and extreme sports\n- Write articles for XCMAG about the above (follow the link to learn more about the reach and the readers profile)\n- Write article for Go Outside Magazine or others\n- I have 20 years of expertise in music royalties flow. I’m a guest teacher at Berklee’s music business graduation and MBA, and I work at a major music company, so I  can help with this knowledge if there is a need to understand how to  monetize original music content.  \n- Create nounish content on instagram (@riofromabove)\n- Create and publish content on Thatsgnar.ly with original music by Bakemono\n- Promote the DAO using Nouns glasses and Gnars logo on my wing to create buzz\n- Wear Nouns glasses on merch during TV interviews or podiums\n- Onboarding more athletes\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Xih3OoN.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9dGPkT7.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Sj4Buqb.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nYvn7x5.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ll8PrGg.jpg)\n",

      "content": "> Vlad: I am sponsoring and supporting this proposal for Pedro Nem (@dabel)\n\nHello family, how are you?\n\nMy name is Pedro Henrique, also known as Nem. I'm 27 years old, I'm a skater and beatmaker musician.\n\nI currently live in São Paulo, but I was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro. I've been skating for over 20 years and a lot of who I am is because of it.\n\nSkateboarding is the art with which I can express my personality, and I also continue to express it through the music I listen to and produce.\n\nI studied design for 2 years at Unifoa -RJ and then I moved to São Paulo to live off skateboarding. However, in 2020 the covid-19 came and I stayed at home producing music and little by little, with the advances in vaccines and releases to the streets, I returned to producing skateboarding videos for my video part, videos for collectives, brand campaigns and competing in Street Skate events. \nMoving and producing, had the opportunity to be featured in Thrasher Magazine and other media outlets.\n\nAnd last year I got to know Nouns through the action in Vale do Anhangabaú/SP at Nouns Weeks…\n\n## **My first contact with Nouns:**\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/reel/Cjfva7gjAg4/?igshid=MGU3ZTQzNzY=\n\n## **My thatsgnarly profile:**\n\nhttps://thatsgnar.ly/thatsgnarly/user/0xc2691f9994af90711d67286be558f4fa631667fd\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VJYdShw.jpg)\n\n## **Drops on thatsgnarly in 1 week:**\n\nhttps://thatsgnar.ly/edition/sculpture-nouns\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jkXTvmu.jpg)\n\n## **Second drop in same week:**\n\nhttps://thatsgnar.ly/edition/time-and-space\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ueGVCpD.jpg)\n\n\n## **Social Media:**\nhttps://www.instagram.com/nemdabel/\n\n**Portfolio being built in these 20 years of skateboarding:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mSZVi2O.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8wodEO2.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7szBh1h.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/38RHbex.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JJUtTGp.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yHHEUDN.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zJ0TgNH.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GT3eLxQ.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JgTe75H.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/n5MasOm.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wGmvVnc.jpg)\n\n## Videos\n\n|**PORTFOLIO VIDEO SEQUENCE:**||\n|-|-|\n[Do Rio Skate Vídeo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh2Bx-dEBJ0&amp;t=1578s)|[📹](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh2Bx-dEBJ0&amp;t=1578s)\n[Dorme Sujo Acorda Limpo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7083vXgQRQ)|[📹](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7083vXgQRQ)\n[Overall Skate Video]()|[📹]()\n[Massa Lajota Massa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EI_--Oq6zY)|[📹](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EI_--Oq6zY)\n[Vidalocagi PROIBIDAO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjXg0xEIf4)|[📹](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjXg0xEIf4)\n[Surreal São Paulo x Asco](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEu50rSYtkM&amp;ab_channel=ASCOSKATEBOARDING)|[📹](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEu50rSYtkM&amp;ab_channel=ASCOSKATEBOARDING)\n[Asco x Bestia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4skw2rSiZw)|[📹](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4skw2rSiZw)\n[Asco Mix Chicxs ( Website in Thrasher Mag)](https://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/videos/asco-s-mis-chicxs-video/)|[📹](https://www.thrashermagazine.com/articles/videos/asco-s-mis-chicxs-video/)\n\n## **BEAT TAPES**:\n\n[🎧 Nunca Satisfeito](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sz-qqLZSk)\n\n[🎧 Tome conta de você](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3n75jEOmuEc)\n\n[\t🎧 Apenas um amor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MscYeI9OBvs&amp;ab_channel=CalMob)\n\n### Following my last proposal according with Gnarthletes pre-documentation, this proposal requires 1 ETH / 2 months \n\n● My main proposal is, through Gnars&#39; sponsorship, to plan myself financially and quit the job I'm currently working on. \n\nI work as a sales supervisor at [Matriz Skate Shop](https://www.matrizskateshop.com.br/) and for the past 3 years I have been reconciling my life between the shop and skateboarding. Which has been wearing me out a lot.\n\nLeaving the store, I will be able to dedicate myself 100% to skateboarding,\nroaming and producing freely around the city and, if possible, around the world. \n\nIntegrating my music productions into various videos and photos exclusively for the Gnars community, showing how Skate Street performs on\nthe web3.\n\n● Thus propagating Gnars in the world of Skateboard for those who identify,\nbringing new members around the world with Nouns.\n\n● Each week (7 days) or 10 days, in total during these 2 months I will be\nproducing videos with my soundtracks for Gnars and That&#39;sGnarly as\nmarketing to boost the platform and on web2.\n\n**Costs for the proposal:**\n● 60% to live as an athlete, (household account, food, transport for content\ncreation)\n● 20% off trips to skate competition and skate gear\n\n● 20% for creating stickers, Gnars apparel for marketing\n",

Gnars Dao alocated me 2k so I can pay mine and my filmer's Andy Haroupias travelling expenses.\n\nWe already have around 80% of video part filmed and there's also a part teaser playing on thatsgnar.ly : https://thatsgnar.ly/creations/haris-housos-gnarsly-part-trailer\n\nPart will be dropping on May 2023\n\n## What are all the details?\n\nMe and Andy have already travelled to lots of destinations around Greece (Thessaloniki, Arta, Lefkada, Ioannina, Filipiada and more) and budget is running low. To finish this part I am asking 0.35 ETH to cover travelling expenses to 3 more destinations (Corfu,Agrinio, Patra) as well as buy a few things I need (boards, shoes, trucks).\n\nI've seen some really awesome spots in those cities and I do wanna skate them so bad hehe! Our current budget only allow us to do 1 day trips, not travel to further destinations and spend the night in hotels.\n\n## How will impact be made?\n\nSkate and film in the spots I want will hype me up to land dope tricks and complete the video part as I envisioned it. This will be the first ever GNARS athlete video part and I want it to be as GNAR'ly as it can get!\n\nGNARS'ly video part will be uploaded to GNARS Youtube channel and will be a permanent advertisement for the DAO. Also hopefully this part motivates GNARS athletes to work on something bigger like a GNARS full video?!?\n\n## Who's part of the team?\n\n - [Haris Housos](https://www.instagram.com/haris_housos/) or @knowhow92\n - [Andy Haroupias](https://www.instagram.com/andreas_haroupias/)\n\n## When will it be done?\n\nDeadline for filming is on April 30 and part will be delivered in May 2023.\n\n## What happens if proposal doesn't get funded\n\nNothing really. There are always closer destinations we can visit and film so we'll keep doing those 1 day trips and hopefully we can find some cool spots to skate.\n\n## Final words\n\nRegardless the outcome of this prop thank you Gnars fam for motivating me to film a video part at my 30's, feels f*cking amazing! \n\nFull video is gonna be dope featuring never-skated-before street spots and will be dropping as an open edition NFT (still working on drop details).\n\n \n    \n",

That's Gnarly Edition Deployment Gas costs (1 month) - 1 ETH\n2. Gami - 0.18ETH\n3. Rocketman - 0.42 ETH\n4. Gnarly Trivia Payments (1 month) - 0.1 ETH\n\n### Introduction\nOne of the most significant challenges we have encountered is the high gas cost associated with deploying NFT editions on That's Gnarly. These costs have made it difficult to have a daily drops on some days, limiting our potential user base from growing.\n\n### What are all the details?\nTo overcome this challenge, we propose to introduce a new initiative that will subsidize the gas costs associated with deploying That's Gnarly Editions on the Ethereum network. We have estimated the highest gas fee we have encountered during these drops is 55$ - 60$ on a high gas fee day.\n\n55$ X 30 Daily Drops ~ 1 ETH cost per month to deploy these editions (Ununsed gas fees will be carried over to next month)\n\n### Gas Refund for Gami + Rocketman\n\nGami and Rocketman have incurred significant gas expenses in their endeavors. We recognize the importance of compensating them for these costs, and we believe that it is in the best interest of the platform to do so. By reimbursing them for these costs, we hope to incentivize and motivate other community members to contribute and create similar projects and initiatives that will benefit our platform.\n\n### Gnarly Trivia Prizes\nOffering a prize for a trivia can incentivize more people to attend the Twitter space, leading to higher levels of engagement, interaction, and participation and this helps in Building community: A prize can bring people together around a common interest, creating a sense of community and shared experience.\n\n",

Then wen we are ready to mint the cc0 EP, 50% will go back to gnars treasury + 50% will be shared amongst ourselves, plus proposer included! \nTrack EP should be ready for debut after 2 weeks of Transaction executions. \nAll Artwork created + music will be made available on nounsounds.wtf\n\n### Why should we?\nThis 5 Track EP is going to be auctioned off as an Open edition for 69 hours and gnarsDAO gets back 50% as usual, but the rest is split between everyone else who has worked on the project, even us who are putting it together. having a 2.69% royalty on a cc0 music piece is kinda like having a house which pays you rent non stop",

      "title": "Collect Royalties for the Treasury on Secondary Sales",
      "content": "## TL;DR\n\nLet’s collect royalties on secondary sales on NFT marketplaces (like OpenSea) that will fund our treasury. While we don’t want to make this a core revenue stream, it will help keep us funded in the near-term and it is something we can always adjust in the future. If we approve this prop, we will seek to collect 4.2069% in royalties on secondary sales. There is no funding request for ETH! This prop is guaranteed to be profitable. \n\n## Introduction\n\nHi Gnarfam! I’m Gnarley-Quinn and I spend most of Gnar time in the auctions channel going pew pew pew. I’m an over-the-hill and retired (amateur) snowboarder and skater now living in Florida, USA, and with my wife, I’m raising what I hope to be two gnarly athletes. I’m a big believer in the Gnars ecosystem and want us to succeed internationally. My proposal does not seek any ETH and will only add ETH to the treasury!\n\n## What are all the details and impact?\n\nMost NFT projects collect a percentage of sales when an NFT is sold on a marketplace such as OpenSea. These are called royalties or creator fees and the amount collected varies from project to project, but typically ranges from 2.5% to 10%. For example, if you sold a Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT for 100 ETH on OpenSea, where the BAYC creator (Yuga Labs) collects 2.5% royalties, the creator would receive 2.5 ETH and you would receive 97.5 ETH from the buyer’s 100 ETH paid to purchase the NFT. While the typical Gnars secondary sale is much less and would only generate a fraction of this ETH, every gwei counts.\n\n![BAYC 2023-02-04 013338.png](ipfs://bafkreiee65bs2vvha6nadcyr6otgf5yncx7oyfobxutl6b4j6e6pkz7gda)\n    \nTo bring this concept home, let’s look at what we could have added to the treasury if we had royalties at the launch of the Gnars collection. For this example, let’s say we had launched with 4.20% royalties. According to OpenSea, as of February 3, 2023, Gnars and Gnars OG had approximately 86 ETH in secondary sales. That would be 3.61 ETH added to our treasury – enough to sponsor an athlete! And as recent sales and auction prices have shown, Gnar values are going up. With increased floor and mint prices, secondary sales volume will also increase, bringing us even more royalties. \n\nTo collect royalties, we only need our Board to notify the relevant marketplaces and designate a wallet to receive them. While some marketplaces do not honor royalties, this should not be a concern for us on OpenSea. \n\nI’m a firm believer in royalties as I think it is one of the best things about NFTs, allowing revenue to flow back to a project’s artist, founder and team members for continuing to create value. The more popular a project becomes, sales volume typically rises and royalties paid to the supporting project increase. It’s a virtuous cycle and something that I think can greatly benefit the Gnars ecosystem. \n\n## When will it be done?\n\nAs soon as the Board notifies the marketplaces, it usually only takes a business day or two for the royalty system to be set up. As we will be reliant on these third parties, we can't guarantee timing. \n\n## Why should we?\n\nThis is low-hanging fruit for generating revenue. Based on trading activity to date, we do not expect the introduction of royalties to have any significant impact on volume. And we can always revisit our royalties to tweak or remove them in the future. Last, and most importantly, royalties make the eth machine go brrrrr! \n\n    \n\n",

Gami is assisting us to set up a multiSend transaction function that will be published as a follow-up proposal for the Gnars NFTs to be withdrawn*\n\n***tl;dr***\n\nAsking for 6 ETH and 5 Gnars from the treasury for Pin.Pusher and Vlad to promote Gnars DAO as ambassadors at ETHDenver and will sponsor a 2-day hangout/workspace at the only legal cannabis consumption social club in Denver, Colorado. The location is in the heart of the Rino Art District in Denver, surrounded by bars and restaurants, and roughly a 5-minute drive from the ETHDenver venue.  Funding will go towards rental fees of the location for 2 days, allow *FREE* entry to any ETHDenver attendee with an ETHDenver ticket or badge along with Gnars DAO members, creating limited merchandise for giveaways, video production of the event, pop-up booth set up, food, snacks and non-alcoholic drinks (alcohol is not permitted at cannabis events per city ordinance), 69 free pre-rolled joints per day for attendees, Gnars DAO talks, a Gnarly skate session-*weather permitting*, a Tony Hawk Pro Skater competition, and more Gnarly Sh**. The 5 Gnars from the treasury will be used for giveaways as onboarding opportunities during the sponsored event and skate session.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/q5tTB8b.jpg)\n\n\n***Event Details***\n\n[ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/) is the longest running ETH event in the world and where a lot of really amazing things have been created, such as our beloved POAP protocol. Last year during the 2022 event, roughly 20,000 people showed up from around the world just for this annual event and it is projected to be even more this year. The event has grown so much that they moved all the way across the city of Denver and will now be held at the National Western Complex instead of the Sports Castle like last year. ETHDenver is an event where projects, builders, creators, companies, and more come to present themselves and their ideas to the masses. The event has always been a short way away from the side events; pop-up galleries, small concerts, meet-ups, and so much more are all going on apart from the actual ETHDenver main event. The event is broken up into three different sections, BUIDLWeek (February 24th-March 1st), the Main Event (March 2nd-March 5th), then followed by snowboarding/skiing Mountain Retreat in Breckenridge, CO (March 6th-March 9th).\n\nThe Gnarly Smoke Lounge and Co-Working Space will be a 2-day event will be open at Tetra Lounge (details on the venue below) on March 2nd and 3rd from 12pm-10pm. We have the opportunity to transform the entire location into a Gnarly hangout for anyone who attends ETHDenver or holds a Gnar to come chill, smoke, and work on things for free. The location will also be open to the public with the normal entry fee for the venue. Pin.Pusher and Vlad will be hosting daily Gnars DAO talks at 4:20pm to explain how the DAO is run, how to join, becoming a sponsored athlete or artist, the new That's Gnarly platform, and any other related questions attendees might have. We will also be joining the Gnars Jam Session and the That's Gnarly Daily Drop Twitter spaces live from the event. We will utilize the existing amenities to showcase Gnars and Gnartwork all over the place along with some of our favorite skate/snowboard/surf videos to make sure everyone feels the Gnarly vibe. We will also be displaying the Gnars auctions live via a projector so people can follow along with the bidding activity, and we will assist them in making their own bids. Being a local to Denver, Pin.Pusher has some connections with a handful of food trucks we will be reaching out to come pop-up out front. Depending on the pricing, will try to cover the cost of some of the food trucks to give out free food to attendees. We will also be bringing in a handful of artists to hang out with us to do some live painting throughout the day. Along with everything named here, we will also be hosting a Tony Hawk Pro Skater tournament where the top competitors will be taking home their own Gnars as prizes; 1st place will receive 0.1 ETH + 1 Gnar and 2nd place will receive 1 Gnar. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FBjoBUz.jpg)\n\n\n***Location***\n\n[Tetra Lounge](https://www.tetralounge.com/) is the first, and currently the only, legal cannabis consumption social club in Denver, CO. They offer a safe and enjoyable environment to consume your cannabis products while socializing with like-minded individuals. To rent the location out entirely, it will cost 1 ETH per day for a total of 2ETH for the 2 days. This will give us access to transform the venue however we please along with covering the entry fees for all ETHDenver attendees who present their ticket or badge. This will also cover any Gnars holders who are not attending ETHDenver. Normally it would cost anyone $20 per day to enter but that fee will be fully taken care of with the daily 1ETH budget over the 2-day event. Tetra Lounge is in the heart of the Rino Art District in Denver (think smaller version of Wynwood, Miami where Art Basel is held), surrounded by murals, bars, restaurants, and other pop-up venues and is one of the most popular areas in Denver and also the closest area to the National Western Complex venue where people will go to eat, drink, and hangout. Our location is roughly a 5-minute drive or around a 20-minute skate from the ETHDenver venue. The capacity of Tetra Lounge is 100 people inside but could be up to 250 guests including the fenced in back patio area-**weather permitting*. \n\nOn location, they have 8 tv's we can use to display Gnartwork, skate videos, and use for the THPS tournament. They have an Xbox for each of the 8 tv's if we need to use all 8 for the tournament. There is also a projector we will have access to for anything to display things at a larger scale. We thought it might be fun to use the projector to display the Gnars auctions and the That's Gnarly daily drops on the screen along with some Gnartworks and Gnars and potentially our championship round of the THPS tournament. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pazvqRN.jpg)\n\n\n\n***Merchandise and Other Giveaways***\n*Everyone loves free sh***\n\nWe will be ordering 138 shirts to give away during the event days. 69 white shirts with the black Gnars branding and 69 black shirts with the white Gnars branding, around $8-$10 per shirt. Since size large is the most common size, we will be ordering them all the same size for easiest and quickest distribution. Shirts will be limited to 69 given away per day to ensure we will have enough over the 2-day period. We will also be ordering 420 3\"x3\" die-cut stickers, around $0.50 per sticker, using Illustradora's Gnarly skateboard logo. Any leftover merch will be handed out during ETHDenver, on-site of the event.\n\nWe will also be providing 69, 1-gram pre-rolled joints per day for all who join us at Tetra Lounge. Pin.Pusher can claim a 30% discount from a local dispensary from past collaborations which will bring the cost of each pre-rolled joint down to roughly $2 a piece, not including taxes. We want to hold a handful of the pre-rolls to be passed out during our 4:20pm Gnars DAO talks to get everyone locked in and Gnarly during it.\n\nThe 5 Gnars will be given out accordingly; the top 2 finishers of the THPS tournament will each receive 1 Gnar and the top 3 finishers of the Gnarly Skate Session will all receive 1 Gnar each. If we are unable to do the Gnarly Skate Session due to weather, we will be holding raffles to give those final 3 Gnars out to attendees over the 2-day event. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tKejAO7.jpg)\n\n\n***Gnarly Skate Session***\n**Weather Permitting* \n\n[Rino Art Skatepark](https://speakeasyskate.com/rino) was created in 2021 as a free, public, skateable art installation. The park is a small, 2,000 sqft concrete park made up of mostly transitions that was once a water drainage area. The park is located right in the middle of the route between ETHDenver and Tetra Lounge, almost an equal distance from the park to either venue tucked away around some apartment buildings and restaurants. Currently there are no lights at the park so any skating will need to occur during the daytime and completed before our 4:20pm Gnars DAO talk. With it being the end of February/beginning of March, there is always the potential of a snowstorm rolling into Denver at this time of year. \n\nWith permission from the weather gods, we will be hosting a 1-day *BEST TRICK CONTEST*. Skaters will have an allotted amount of time to perform their Gnarlist trick at the park in a head-to-head style tournament with the winner of each match up moving on to the next round. Skaters will be randomly paired up to compete against one another. Winners are to be voted on by the crowd via cheering to continue the feel of decentralized/community style voting. The skater who wins it all will receive 0.25 ETH + 1 Gnar. 2nd and 3rd place will receive 1 Gnar each. \n\n**ALL SKATERS WILL BE REQUIERED TO SIGN A WAIVER IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN CONTEST*\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8wUP78m.jpg)\n\n***Gnarketing***\n\nETHDenver officially begins on Feburary 24th with its #BUIDLWeek, so we will be taking this opportunity to go meet everyone on-site and pass out flyers, stickers, and invite people in person to join us for our Gnarly hangout on March 2nd and 3rd to find out more about Gnars DAO. We will make sure to have plenty of these flyers printed to not only hand-out, but to also leave around the city at different skate shops, smoke shops, food markets, art spaces, and other Gnarly spots around Denver in order to maximize the amount of people who might be interested in attending. Along with the physical flyers, we will be promoting the event to all social media platforms using the same image.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YfMHzUx.jpg)\n\n\n***Budget Breakdown***\nVenue Rental - 2 ETH\nMerch/Giveaway Items - 1.15 ETH\nContest ETH Prizes - 0.35 ETH\nFood and Drinks - 0.4 ETH\nGnarketing - 0.1 ETH\nLive Painters (2) - 0.5 ETH (0.25 ETH each)\nVideo Production - 0.5 ETH\nGnars Ambassadors (2) - 1 ETH (0.5 ETH each)\n\n5 Gnars NFT's for Prizes/Giveaways\n\nTotal = 6 ETH + 5 Gnars\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PUsjxpe.png)\n\n*Please view discussion on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/928811922244137020/1065843424399458376) for any further details or questions you may have.*",

I have already paid him 3 ETH upfront to commence work with an expected lead time of 2-3 weeks. \n\n### Scope of work\n\n- Protocol upgrades\n\n    - Replace auction house to include time extensions\n    - Migrate gnosis safe and snapshot to DAO executor\n\n        - Gnars V2 as main voting token (regular weight)\n        - Gnars OG as 2nd voting token (double weight)\n\n- Frontend upgrades \n\n    - Update content where required\n    - Deploy voting and delegation ui\n    - Show auctions until gnarving\n    - Add download PNG button\n    - Display traits on mobile\n    - Resolve .⌐◨-◨ names \n\n- Backend upgrades\n\n    - Migrate our hosting to Vercel\n    - Setup auto deploy new builds\n    - Refactoring and optimisation\n\n## Further details\n\nVolky has been collaborating with Sammdec to ensure we make the most of work already done, I've included some further information below for transparency:\n\n### Gnars Tokens \n\nGnars OG: `0x494715b2a3c75dadd24929835b658a1c19bd4552`\nGnars V2: `0x558BFFF0D583416f7C4e380625c7865821b8E95C`\n\n### Gnars Auction House \n\nAuctionHouse Proxy: `0xc28e0d3c00296dd8c5c3f2e9707361920f92a209`\nAuctionHouse: `0x46e57901ea1edd8a200cf982af4fd8cc3a957974`\nProxyAdmin: `N/A`\n\n### Nouns Auction House \n\nAuctionHouseProxy: `0x830bd73e4184cef73443c15111a1df14e495c706`\nAuctionHouse: `0xf15a943787014461d94da08ad4040f79cd7c124e`\nProxyAdmin: `0xc1c119932d78ab9080862c5fcb964029f086401e`\n\n### Nouns DAO contracts \n\nNounsDAOProxy: `0x6f3e6272a167e8accb32072d08e0957f9c79223d`\nNounsDAOLogicV2: `0x51c7d7c47e440d937208bd987140d6db6b1e4051`\nNounsDAOExecutor: `0x0bc3807ec262cb779b38d65b38158acc3bfede10`\n\n\n### Additional considerations\n\nVolky has taken a careful and considered approach to planning for the changes. Our discussion has led to a number of gas optimisations, an innovative approach to our dual token voting arrangement (OG and V2), building out a test suite, and getting our GitHub setup properly with a full mono-repo like Nouns DAO.\n\nLooking forward to setting the stage for others to shine and helping steward Gnars DAO to greater heights and a brighter future.\n\n[Gami](https://twitter.com/0xigami) ⌐◨-◨",

      "title": "[Prop 47]  Gnars Hive Account Managemenet",
      "content": "![](https://i.imgur.com/3YlPbhX.png)\n\n*Screenshot from Gnars Hive account wallet taken on 1/23/2023*\n\nTLDR : Asking 2.4 ETH funding for 3 months (0.8 Eth/month) for managing Gnars Hive blockchain account (activity, community building and treasury). \n\n### Some info about me\n\nFor those who don't know me my name is Haris or @knowhow92 on social, life-long skateboarder, Web 3 content creator, founder/ community manager of [Skatehive](https://discord.gg/skatehive) and board member/athlete of Gnars.DAO\n\nI'm an active builder on Hive blockchain (former Steem) for 5 years and since October 2022 I'm managing Gnars account On Hive. \n\n### My GNARly work on Hive\n\nManaging Gnars Hive account requires deep knowledge of how the social layer of Hive works like best hours for posting,tags used, post formation,people/projects/communities we follow/engage with etc., deep understanding of the blockchain itself and lots of hours of online activity weekly, just like every social media.\n\nSome of the most note-worthy stuff I do for Gnars Hive account are\n\n - **Posting** : Currently posting from Gnars account 2 times a week. Some of those posts are mirroring [Gnarly News](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@gnars/gnarly-news-13) by Satori, [Gnars shredding report](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@gnars/gnars-shredding-report-january-05-january-11-2k23)  authored  by me on a weekly basis, [Gnarthly Hive growth report](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@gnars/gnarthly-hive-growth-report) authored  by me on a monthly basis and more. \n\n\n - **Curating** : A month ago after Gnars community voted \"For\" in [Skatehive's Decentralized Sponsorship Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0x6100932649facab93f27106b0f8bf28194edb952e5c0866b9c297b850d72cedb),  Gnars Hive account [Powered up 11k Hive](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@gnars/gnarly-11k-hive-power-up) so we can support extreme sports athletes on Hive. Since then we've distributed hundreds of dollars to skateboarders and surfers via upvotes on their content (curation) thanks to the awesome tokenomics of Hive and Gnars/Skatehive as well as partners (other projects on Hive). \n\n> When I'm curating content from Gnars account I always make sure I distribute rewards in a fair way and check every content thoroughly so I can be certain it's original. \n\n - **Engagement** I am engaging in extreme sports athletes content (and some finance content) on a daily basis cause that's the best way to get noticed and build a solid following. \n\n\n - **Hive Treasury Growth and Management** : I am growing Gnars Hive wallet daily either by posting, commenting or curating content on Hive blockchain. I am making sure all our rewards are managed correctly and split equally in both Hive and HBD (Hive stablecoin) so we can have both stability and safety in our account. \n\n----------------\n\n### Benefits of an active Gnars Hive account?\n\n**1) Supporting the artistry of extreme sports athletes**\n\nGnars Hive account distributes crypto rewards to all extreme sports athletes on Hive. What's more Web3 than distributing crypto rewards to every extreme sports athlete posting on a decentralized social media? Decentralized accounts, un-censorable content and tokenized interactions. A paradise for our athletes. \n\nOn the screnshot bellow you can check the weekly stats inside Skathehive community and some of those $376 weekly pending rewards are coming from Gnars account.\n\n*Screenshot taken on 1/13/2022*\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2KdqKOj.png)\n\n**2) Onboarding**\n\nAs we grown our reputation and treasury on Hive we'll get noticed more meaning more growth for our DAO. Hive users are all familiar with crypto and NFTs so it's definitely an audience we wanna capture.\n\nAbout athletes onboarding, a bunch of folks from Skatehive and Hive have already joined Gnars and more will be coming if we keep of Gnars Hive account \n in high levels.\n\n**3) Decentralized Social Media**\n\nHaving an active online blog in one of the most-useds social blockchain right now is matters. No-one can delete our content, we're reaching out to like-minded people (athletes/investors/artists) and we're supporting the Web3 decentralized movement.\n\n**4) Diversification**\n\nNot having all our eggs in one basket is very healthy for a DAO. Our current stake on Hive is worth $4,391.030 at the moment of writing with Hive price at $0.39.\n\nOur stake will only keep growing as we curate and create GNARly content and those rewards compound on a daily basis. Hive is a gift that keeps on giving.\n\n### What to expect\n\nI have many plans for Gnars Hive account in the near future if the community is with me on this one! Some of them are\n\n - Collaborate with Gnars community members and create more Gnarly content to post on our Hive blog, just like I currently do with Satori's [Gnarly News](https://gnarlynews.substack.com/)\n\n - Sponsoring Skatehive's upcoming “GetStoken” Contest  (more info soon) \n\n - Creating arts and sports contests for our Hive followers\n\n - Growing our followers and engagement as well as our Hive treasury \n \n> You can check Gnars latest [Gnarthly Hive growth report](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@gnars/gnarthly-hive-growth-report) for more info about Gnars Hive account and treasury growth.\n\n### Requesting 2.4 ETH for 3 Months\n\nI am requesting 0.8 ETH/month for my upcoming work on Gnars Hive account for the months of February, March and April. \n\nI have already recieved 0.8 ETH for managing [Gnars Hive account](https://stoken.wtf/@gnars/blog) 3 months ago when my [Sponsorship proposal to Gnars Dao](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0x31d9113448e4dc06cf86cb8b2d94681297769fbe6cde158c24745c7eaf0f1b62) passed and if you're happy with the results so far you can vote \"FOR\" when this proposal goes live for voting. \n\n### What happens if proposal doesn't pass\n\nAs promised in [Skatehive's Decentralized Sponsorship Proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0x6100932649facab93f27106b0f8bf28194edb952e5c0866b9c297b850d72cedb) I am gonna keep posting the \"Weekly Shredding Report\" as well as mirror Satori's \"Gnarly News\" but will spend less time in growing Gnars reputation and treasury on Hive. \n\nWhat I am currently doing for Gnars on Hive is really time consuming so I am gonna keep it simple and won't engage in posts as well as think and execute account growth strategies such as new weekly posts and organising contests.   \n\n\n---------\n\nThank you all for reading and feel free to ask me anything at [Gnars Discord](https://www.discord.gg/gnars), I'd be more than happy to answer all your questions.\n\nCheers and...\n\n### SKATE4LIFE\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vtVg3px.png)\n",

      "title": "[Prop. 43] Celebrate“The Gnarving”by buying Nouns!",
      "content": " \n![1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreifu4sn3mbu7j2ov7bq26iew2bzatvg4dgvcbshcbhorriznf7kymm)\n\nThe Gnars Auction Contract is unique and fascinating, For every 1000 auctions reached, the auction duration is doubled. As time continues to lengthen, the difficulty increases, and a series of very intense sniper battles will take place in the future. So I suggested: we should buy Nouns to commemorate those moments when the auction duration doubles!\n\nDetails\n\nWhy buy Nouns?     - It would be incomplete to purchase Nouns that simply commemorates“The Gnarving”.\n\n1. As a kind of investment and value reserve to pave the way for future large capital proposals. Referring to The proposal 189 (https://nouns.wtf/vote/189) , we can see that it is perfectly feasible, but in the end, the proposal was not passed by a mere 4 votes, which is regrettable.\n \n![2.png](ipfs://bafkreibremeu63a6thioxfkcyfzvfotdoc7lz2jdcqinbl42c5d325kqmu)\n    \n2. We know that Nouns DAO is the most famous CC0 project. As of today, hundreds of sub-DAOs (e.g. Lilnouns, SharkDao...) have been created because of nouns. (https://nouns.center/projects) It is a question to think about how to break through in these projects and let more friends know Gnars. I think nouns holders are a rich and wise group , like an ocean of resources, and we can use this ocean to attract friends who love extreme sports to our community and become a new booster.\n\n3. Gami (0xigami.eth) personally owns Noun#189, Noun#401 and Noun#542. But gnars (gnars.eth) did not hold nouns.\n \n![3.1.png](ipfs://bafkreifetw3mbvsn5a2h5v5xojb2e2uymq74xi526atebxpkyx54fqx7om)\n    \n\n![3.png](ipfs://bafkreibvf2lv75ibffcpx6h66h5hg3q5eqvport2o5ylke5oneplgw62ou)\n    \n\nI see them both as separate entities, but with a very close relationship. Gami helps gnars attract more traffic and hotspots, while gnars also provides partial financial support for Gami.\n \n![4.png](ipfs://bafkreicewftlxstostsw25fvlfnaohgt5i6b425do6aucodx3xbc3xrm4a)\n    \n\nWhen buy Nouns?\n \n![5.png](ipfs://bafkreiacqxq4yv6j5zgpsbeeacl4m4itylwr4cckopy4a46av44hl3cwwe)\n    \nThe figure shows that whenever the auction duration doubles we bid a noun and deposit it in the gnars.eth so that all Gnars become common holders.\n\nWhat to do after buy?\n\n1. \tVote by Gnars decision to help Gami or other friends' proposals to provide support.\n2. Applicants for the nouns proposal are welcome to canvass our community, thereby increasing Gnars overall impact.\n\n\nWho am I?\n\nI am a Chinese college student with a passion for extreme sports, majoring in marketing. My English is not very good, and I have revised it many times using ‘DeepL’ translation software, so please understand if there is anything wrong.\n \n![6.jpg](ipfs://bafkreiercsrznf4rnafhy5jtibv5awkeoyyk4xwguzguwfwgxuohewzh5i)\n    \n \n![7.jpg](ipfs://bafybeihrrwqungrjyz2cf4x6ctpp3jomuwij2qkck5gjxa6gnqabdmj77q)\n    ",

Gnars holders get 1 vote per token, and Gnars OG counts for 2 (same as the Snapshot space).\n\nThe best content is \"dropped\" by the DAO via an open edition or a 1/1 auction. Athletes whose content is successfully voted to drop receive 1 Gnars NFT. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/koKIMXy.jpg)\n\nProceeds (ETH) from the drops are split between the athlete and the Gnars DAO treasury, 50/50. \n\nWe propose the following structure:\n\n* An Open Edition for the top video of the day \n\n    * 24h duration, 0.0069 ETH each\n    * 1 Gnar to athlete\n\n* A 1/1 Auction for top of the week \n\n    * 24h duration\n    * 1 Gnar to athlete\n\nAdditionally, we're exploring closed editions as a means to drop the #2-5 pieces of content of the day to get more creators paid. We will share updates and make community decisions in Discord.\n\nWe will learn from the MVP and iterate to find the best drop setup that maximizes the following by order of importance:\n\n1. ETH earned by athletes (ETH * # of athletes earning)\n2. Revenue to Gnars DAO\n3. Ownership (Gnars NFTs) distributed to athletes\n\nDrops will pay out to a 0xsplits contract, with half going to Gnars DAO and half to a [multisig](https://app.safe.global/eth:0x50aBcbF1ca3ad1826cCe9d5B69D5Bee0bA446728/home) controlled by rocketman, Gami, and Vlad to payout athletes their share until a more trustless option is convenient.\n\n## What we need to launch\n\n### Gnars NFTs\n\nWe're requesting 50 Gnars NFTs from the multisig, which will be sufficient for at least 2 months of drops. These NFTs will be issued exclusively to athletes whose content is auctioned off.\n\n### Feedback from you!\n\nAre you a Gnars holder? Go vote! Test out the platform! What feels weird, what do you like? Any feedback is much appreciated. \n\nAre you an athlete? Visit [thatsgnar.ly](https://thatsgnar.ly), submit a video this week and test it out. Give us feedback in this [Discord channel.](https://discord.com/channels/928811922244137020/1052284040352366672)\n\n## Launch\n\nWe are launching this Thursday (1/12/2023) at 8pm EST on the [Gnars Jam Session](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare). \n\nWe will mint the first 24h open edition at 8pm, so submissions and voting will open the day before on 1/11/2023 at 8pm EST. The platform will be shared heavily on Twitter and we could use the community's help here! Follow the #thatsgnarly account [here.](https://twitter.com/thatsgnar_ly)\n\nThe more people submitting content, voting, and bidding, the more athletes we can onboard, the more ETH Gnars DAO earns, and the more powerful this movement becomes.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gugCzVm.jpg)\n\nIt's time, let's start a revolution.

      "content": "# Gnarly News\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gNedm9b.png)\n\n\n**TLDR:** Requesting retroactive funding for past newsletters and funding to continue for the next 3 months (6 months of work total). Check out the publication at http://gnarly.news!\n\n\n---\n# Gnarly News Newsletter\nAs anyone who spends time in nounish discords knows, keeping up with all the latest updates can be a full time job in and of itself. There is a ton of information - upcoming projects and ideas, active proposals, contests, news, media from events, governance discussions etc. The goal of Gnarly News is to publish a weekly editorial condensing this abundace of information into a format that is easy to digest but captures the most important updates from the week.\n\nSo far, the weekly newsletter has been published 13 times with the first edition launching on 9/21/22 and a new publication going out every week since, except for two (due to travel/holidays). The newsletter highlights the latest developments within the Gnars ecosystem, including active and upcoming proposals, event updates, community highlights, and even current events in the broader Nouns ecosystem.\n\nSince launch, the newsletter has reached over 2,300 reads and accumulated 365 subscribers (~68 organic, the rest have been brought over from an existing email list via Gami). It's also frequently referenced during Gnars Jam Sessions and is posted to [SkateHive](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@gnars/gnarly-news-13) thanks to KnowHow. Lately each edition garners between 180-225 reads.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TdpImRD.png)\n\nAs you can see in the chart above, interest has been slowly increasing over time with a marked uptick in daily visits beginning in November. Currently, the newsletter has an average open rate of 31%, which is fairly high considering a substantial number of subscribers were imported and may not have been aware of Gnars prior to receiving the newsletter. Below is a chart depicting the growth in subscribers over the past 90 days.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7z7lctC.png)\n\nThe newsletter has proven to be a valuable resource for the community, and I anticipate that it's reach will only continue to grow from here. It's not only useful to those within the Gnars community, but the 'In Other Nouns' section at the end contains major news and events from around the nouniverse and can help you branch out as well. Between Prop House, Lil Nouns, and other nounish sub-DAOs there is always exciting stuff happening, and I compile the most exciting ones here.\n\n\n---\n\n# Scope\n* Provide comprehensive weekly updates of the latest news and updates within Gnars DAO\n* Provoke conversation around active and upcoming proposals\n* Feature content from Gnars sponsored athletes and projects\n* Highlight community events, projects, and builders contributing to the Gnars ecosystem\n\n---\n\n# Funds Requested\n\nRetroactive funding for the first 13 publications is requested at half of the rate moving forward.\n\n* Retroactive Funding\n    * 13 Publications @ 0.20 ETH = 2.60 ETH\n* Moving Forward (3 months)\n    * January - 3 Publications @ 0.40 ETH = 1.20 ETH\n    * February - 4 Publications @ 0.40 ETH = 1.60 ETH\n    * March - 5 Publications @ 0.40 ETH = 2.00 ETH\n* **Total = 7.40 ETH for 25 Publications over 6 months**",

      "title": "[Prop. 36] Sponsor Bennie Osnow, Dakota Connole, and Sam Gnoza w/ 9 ETH (Professional Skiing)",
      "content": "Hi GnarsDAO,\nOur names are Bennie Osnow, Dakota Connole, and Sam Gnoza. We are professional skiers based out of Salt Lake City Utah. Seeing that there aren’t many Gnars athletes that are skiers yet, us three would like to join as athletes to help introduce Gnars to the skiing community. We will do this by creating skiing content for the Gnars youtube channel. We are connected with people in the industry and our ski Videos are watched by people Worldwide!\n\n## Who we are?\n### 1. Dakota Connole: \n![DC1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreig5q7fex73lh7i5iitfuetnkfi2wp2apk7tulu7iokakq26aqagvy)\nI am a 24 year old professional skier from Taos, New Mexico. My name is Dakota Connole and for the past nine years home base has been in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah. Throughout my time in Utah I have transitioned from competing in high level slope style competitions to filming for one of the best street skiing crews called ‘Child Labor.’ \n\nI am currently starting my fifth season of filming street skiing with them. Last year I competed in a railjam in Ukraine, and was a Level 1 Superunkown finalist last year. I am sponsored by 686 technical apparel, Vishnu skis, and Vortech corp. In terms of what is to come I will continue to push my mental and physical limits as an athlete to progress the sport and to meet my own personal goals. For this season I plan to continue filming for another street video, to attend team film shoots with 686 and other sponsors, and hopefully make some Nounish content for the Gnars Dao!\n\n### 2.Sam Gnoza: \n![SG1.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeidlfux3subkblu5dloun5ylrj2rjux2dz4drsjgwskseefwqzxdjq)\nI’m Sam, 24 years old from Killington, Vermont. I’ve been skiing all my life. When I was younger I was a competitive skier, but have found my real passion through a more creative approach. I got my first camera in high school, and since then, I have used being behind the lense as a tool to share my creativity with the world filming friends. Capturing a moment behind the lense is special because it lasts forever. \n\nI have also skied in multiple private park shoots with Ski The East and, Killington Mountain. I am sponsored by Line skis, Joy Stick, and R3. For the past 5 years, with Dak & Bennie, I’ve spent most of my winters filming street skiing.\n\n### 3. Bennie Osnow: \n![BO1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreif6l3fiu4pgxmoa4na4opyppo5u2msqjvhviju7mdsyzifj4eaztm)\nHi my name is Bennie Osnow. I’m 22 years old. I grew up in Londonderry Vermont, And went to highschool with Sam. I stopped competing early on to pursue making ski videos. my senior and following year of high school, I started filming for C sessions, a web seried made for Carinthia parks at Mountsnow, and did private park shoots with Ski the East. I then moved to Salt Lake city in 2019, and have continued my passion for making videos, focusing most of time on street skiing. I am sponsored by Line Skis, Vortech Corp, Smoke Proper, and R3 pants. \n\nI also have recently worked with some other major companies like Evo, Woodward, 805 beer, Level 1, and I’ve been featured in Freeskier magazine. Along with the videos I am excited to make for the Gnars DAO this season, I am also filming multiple street projects and filming for the Line Traveling Circus, the longest running ski web-series online.\n\n## Deliverables\n### We are proposing 3 ETH for each of us to be sponsored riders for the Gnars Dao. In return we will create \n1. 4, 5-7 minute long edits to be posted on gnars youtube channel throughout the winter season (Jan-april) each edit will have around 20-30 clips we will send to be utilized on all other Gnars and Nouns social media pages (120+ clips of footage)\n2. Always speak highly of the gnars Dao and teach more of the ski and snowboarding communities what its all about tag gnars dao in social media posts\n3. Talk with different companies and event organizers to get gnars involved with different types of events in the skiing world,(video shoots, railjams, movie premieres…)\nWhen we post these edits, we will ask our other sponsors to help promote the videos to get more exposure over to the Youtube. Posting these videos on Gnars can lead to more people finding the Dao.\n\n## External Links & Other Work\n\nHere’s some example videos that we have filmed/ been skiing in:\nhttps://vimeo.com/291089339\nThis is a video of Sam and Bennie in 2019 at MtHood\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDI6y_arg4M\nThis is Dakota\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19aie66cWpk&t=8s\nEdit of Bennie\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FzX5RXZP2T8\nLine traveling Circus, featuring Bennie\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ZW-03UnSZt0\nHeres our Newest street skiing film “Why Not?” featuring all of us\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1XWBwYsRgFtCsJtWtnetmg\nThis is the page for our street skiing crew most of our videos are posted\n\ninstagram pages:\nBennie Osnow: [www.instagram.com/_bennie]\n\nDakota Connole: [https://www.instagram.com/dakattak_/]\n\nSam Gnoza: [https://www.instagram.com/gnoza_content/]\n\nWe are really excited to start working with the Gnars Dao and help promote and grow the community!

Call me Mari, aka [@marinioac](https://twitter.com/marinioac) or [@mari.salles_](https://www.instagram.com/mari.salles_/) , I'm not a pro athlete but a gnarly one. \n\nI surf, I fly and I ski. I live and breathe gnarly sports.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ig7wfmb.jpg)\n\n\n\nI'm partner of [Surfguru](http://www.surfguru.com.br), the best wave forecast website of Brazil. Surfguru has more than +250K users per month and +1MM access per month. \n\n\nI'm a web3 enthusiast and I’m totally in love with all the Nouns ecosystem. I bought my first crypto early 2020, I became part of a DAO late 2021 and I bought my first NFT mid 2022. During this year, I was part of the codesign of [Surflimpo](https://www.cambiatus.com/surflimpo)/[Surfhive](https://peakd.com/c/hive-141964/created) communities and [Drop](https://surflimpo.cambiatus.io/invite/3WRkvw), a social currency for beach cleanups. I’ve been in the Gnars community for about 3 months and I have 7 Gnars. I Know I'm a newbie in the Web3 world. But I'm for sure a believer that Nouns and Gnars are here to stay. \n\nI've gotten 2 proposal approved so far, one by [LilSisters (1eth)](https://www.addressform.io/board/details/b1dd12cd-4c10-4a4a-b5f8-c6410dc72ae2/fund-the-first-cc0-3d-print-wearable-noggles/3159) and another one was a subDAO collab by [Gnars (2.5eth)](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0x0b3d6c307f7e596892dda29cf4914598368c0b0212739081290ab6608de770cf) , [Lil Sisters (0.5eth) and NounsBR (0.5eth)](https://www.addressform.io/board/details/f4772eb9-9ee3-479b-b957-d602415a100b/finance-children-in-need-at-tpm-a-brazilian-ngo-from-nuala-costa-an-lgbtqiap-black-surfer/2606) to sponsor children to surf from TPM NGO in Maracaípe, Brazil.

So in 2011, I quit looking for jobs and I decided to fulfill my dream to make my own ski. Thus I learned the process by myself researching all over the internet. There were very little info at the time, so I decided to give back to the community [a video of the whole process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CGm5_3GsQA), also because:\n* I knew no one would ever believe a Brazilian female could make a pair of really good skis. \n* There weren’t any decent female skis on the market at the time. They were designed for very strong women. So I made a pair to fit my size (5’3”, 110 pound female) inspired by a Dynafit backcountry all mountain design. Four years later, Faction Skis made a pair pretty similar to my design for women.\n* While I was researching, I had to stitch a bunch of incomplete information from YT and forums. Therefore I decided to make a video about the entire process to give back to the community one full content with all the necessary info to DIY a pair of skis. This video it's one of the most watched DIY ski videos on YT until today.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4MxgNOY.png)\n\nFour years later, I was invited to host [14 episodes of a Brazilian TV series](https://vimeo.com/167509611) from [Canal OFF](https://www.instagram.com/canaloff/) about backcountry skiing in New Zealand. I got the spot because of my DIY ski video.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nBpRxT1.png)\n\n\nIn the meantime, I went back to Brazil and I founded 2 companies (Bolei and [Vrum Vrum](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/109095074)) focused on recycling, upcycling, rethinking product design creation, fabrication and usage. But I never liked to sell products, then, I changed directions and I decided to work with tech and education. I pioneered the [Maker Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mklywR7TQxs) (DIY) in Brazil (2011) and later I started to teach Product Design and [STEAM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C48oHf1TOcg) at a High School and a social project (2019-2021). Some of my students made a skateboard quarter pipe at a school that never allowed skateboarding inside, until then.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BheP4X1.png)\n\n\nDuring the Pandemic, I designed an open source (CC0) face shield to donate to public health institutions. [We donated more than 8k face shields](https://www.instagram.com/p/CA-YocBJ78A/) around Brazil and my project was used in Ireland and Iran.\n\nMeanwhile, I've been a partner of 3 tech start-ups: \n1st) [OHMS](https://www.instagram.com/partiufazer.ohms/) (2014-2017), the first Makerspace of Rio. We developed hardware and software for artists, engineers and children in the autistic spectrum disorder;\n2nd) [GreenAnt](https://www.greenant.com.br/english/greenant) (2014-2021), an AI software developer for the renewable energy trading market;\n3rd) [Surfguru](http://www.surfguru.com.br) (2021 - present), the largest wave forecast website of Brazil.\n\nOf corse I’m a feminist. I’ve also pioneered women’s surfing and flying movements in Brazil. I was part of a [Canal OFF documentary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tSzAYOY7eVtPnP3AqJRTO5_uESR9egU1/view?usp=sharing) about the first Women Paragliding Festival of Latin America, Saia pra Voar (2015).\n\n\nToday I manage [Surfguru](http://www.surfguru.com.br)’s tech, design, impact and community areas.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Zb7J1tD.jpg)\n\nSince 2020, I’ve been living in the most iconic surf town of Brazil, Saquarema, which is the host of WSL main events: [Championship Tour](https://www.worldsurfleague.com/events/2022/ct/7/oi-rio-pro/main), [Challengers Series](https://www.worldsurfleague.com/events/2022/cs/26/corona-saquarema-pro/main) and [Qualifying Series 5000](https://www.worldsurfleague.com/events/2022/qs/94/saquarema-surf-festival/main). Saquarema is an awesome place to proliferate the meme to be seen by the world.\n\n\n## But what about Gnars?\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Yn4yVZm.png)\n\n\nAs a Gnars Athlete, my goal is to collab on developing Gnars brand, athlete merch and merch for the community. Creating and making it IRL. I also want to spark attention with gnarly photos and videos surfing and flying wearing gnarly merch made by me. Last but not least, I will make some weird pixeled gnartwork like these (collab with XMPNK):\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/q0teBui.gif)\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GWyC7sK.gif)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a community builder and a Surfguru partner, I'm gonna be creating Gnars content on Surfguru's media, such as **#gnarswave** of the month inspired by Skatehive to keep building Surfhive and Gnars web2 community. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qpXcxXF.jpg)\n*Data from Surfguru's Instagram*\n\nI also want to make meaningful connections for Gnars. I’ve been introducing Gnars to female surfers, paragliders and designers around Brazil. I started onboarding [female athletes to Lil Sisters](https://www.addressform.io/board/details/b1dd12cd-4c10-4a4a-b5f8-c6410dc72ae2/let-lil-sisters-go-surfing/3183) and soon to Gnars.\n\nSome examples that I can design for Gnars:\n* CC0 3D print wearable Gnarggles ([I’m already prototyping](https://www.instagram.com/reel/ClRR30Qphdr/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet))\n* Upcycled Gnars fivepanels caps and buckets made **of** [Sol Paraglider's fabric production residue](https://www.solparagliders.com.br/) and made **by** the skateboarders from [WayWardCaps](https://www.instagram.com/waywardcaps/) (It's on it's way)\n* Gnars NFT buttons (done)\n* Gnars Flag to fly\n* Gnars see through stickers for ski/fly goggles lenses\n* Connect small and interesting brands to make Gnars Merch and onboard them to take eth\n* I can provide CAD work (blueprint) to replicate Gnarly sculptures.\n* And who knows what\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/a4IhwzB.jpg)\n\nI hope this opportunity is just a kickoff for a long term relationship as a Gnars Athlete and builder.\n\nCheers and thanks for reading it all ✨❤️\nLet's get gnarly!\n",

      "content": "## About me\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qIquSyR.png)\n\n\n**Take 2 minutes to know me some more [on this link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFDHALIT2w/xxVFkxd67Su6PK_GxHLnkA/view)**\n\nHello guys! I’m Lucas Rocha, 28 years old, started surfing at 8 and still more excited to do it than ever, nowadays though, I usually chase bigger waves. I got into the Blockchain world in 2018 and I currently work as a community builder in some projects, such as [NXF Bodyboard](https://www.instagram.com/nxfbodyboard/?hl=pt) and [Surfhive](https://peakd.com/c/hive-141964/created).\n\n\n## Work at NXF Bodyboard\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M9HIHkG.png)\n\n\nNXF was founded in 2005 and it’s a collective of brazilian bodyboarders focused on hunting big waves and creating content about it. The collective became notorious in Brazil and around the world after discovering and surfing the AVALANCHE - the gnarliest wave in Brazil. [(one wave at Avalanche surfed by me in 2021)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CQtsgHHj2bz/)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Gjq5mKV.jpg)\nGetting out of a cave this winter \n\n## Community Building\n\nI’ve been working as a community builder at NXF Bodyboard since june 2021, when we entered the Web3 atmosphere and it’s been amazing. We were approved for a [10k USD grant from Harmony Protocol](https://talk.harmony.one/t/nxf-bodyboard-big-wave-surfing-nfts-and-web3-education-project-y/15948) to develop educational work involving Big surf, Web3, NFTs and Blockchain. Since then, I’ve worked organizing meetups, doing presentations, development of NFT drops and press releases. I’m also responsible for the treasury management at NXF.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/VZOnj6D.png)\nMeetup at [Base27](https://www.instagram.com/base27.co/), an Innovation HUB inside [Rede Gazeta](https://www.instagram.com/redegazetaes/) (state correspondent to [Globo](https://www.instagram.com/tvglobo/) - Biggest TV channel in Brazil)\n\nSurfing is a long time passion. Me and my friends have been creating content of our action since before the Gopros became a thing, the idea was to take the footage of what we did in the sea, edit it, and show it to the biggest number of people we could.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m4PM1TK.png)\nOne wave back in 2009\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NGMsnzz.jpg)\nAnother one, nowadays ⌐◨-◨\n\nI’m still doing (kind of) the same crazyness when it comes to content creation, being more specific, joining surf and Web3 is exactly what I've been working on in the last few years. In April this year we created our first NFT collection as an experiment on how we could interact with communities and support our project using Web3 platforms. In June we launched our 2nd collection about a wave we discovered and surfed for the 1st time in 2012 (10 years ago) and named it ‘2012 - Treasury in Vitoria Bay’\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qPwh1bU.png)\nPresentation on Web3, NFTs and the NXF case for the community.\n\nI’m really excited to be part of GNARS and Nouns community and thankful to Gami after getting my first Gnar [(Gnar 640)](https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x558bfff0d583416f7c4e380625c7865821b8e95c/640), which I baptized as aquarium head! ahahaha\n![](https://i.imgur.com/qcyqG7T.png)\n\nAnd to close it of, my new Gnarly hat! (Thanks Luiz!) \n![](https://i.imgur.com/c2NNAuO.jpg)\n\n\n## Sponsorship proposal\n\nIt would be an honor to be part of the select team of Gnars extreme athletes and help this community grow and bring even more impact on society. I propose 3 ETH for 6 months, which would be headed to: ***1)** content creation and the logistics needed to produce it, **2)** cost of living for 6 months, **3)** merch creation (Nounish hoodies, hats, shirts, stickers)*. \n\n**◎** In return, I commit to deliver consistent Nounish content on social media (spreading ⌐◨-◨) and work on bringing Gnars to notoriety in every community I’m part of. \n\n**◎** NXF Bodyboard  social media profiles ([IG](https://www.instagram.com/nxfbodyboard/), [YT](https://www.youtube.com/@nxfbodyboard2986)) would also leverage Nounish content (since Luiz Haddad, Gnars Team Member, is also part of NXF and the content we produce fits exactly into \"extreme sports\" subject - enabling total sinergy).\n\n**◎** And at last but not least, Nounish merch (⌐◨-◨) would be always on my boards, hoodies, tshirts or hats, in any media I upload. Gotta be Nounish!\n\nI would also become the 2nd member of [Surfhive](https://peakd.com/c/hive-141964/created) to be on the Gnars team along with @luizhadad to take the surf and bodyboard flag on!\n\nCheers to everybody and a big thanks to my brother @luizhadad for introducing me to the community and reviewing my proposal!\n",

The small amount of ETH included in this proposal will be used for:\n- Payment for printing and labeling a pre-existing hot sauce (white-label).\n- Postage for sending out samples to discord winners and sponsored extreme athletes (drop-ship and manually).\n- Taste samples, hosting, and material needs. \n\nGnar 2767 will be moved to gnarsauce.eth and used as the primary gnar for labeling.\n\n \n![This is the gnar in question](ipfs://QmewhovtATQJ5QHjt1S6gkAP3Qy4MWPujg2dvkedW8czRV)\n    \n\n# Timeframe\n(Immediately) Public feedback, conversion to a markdown proposal with feedback to be presented to a board meeting.\n- A month of design work and competitive hot sauce/whitelabel/dropship research.\n- A month of active community votes while finalizing designs and first run participants.\n- - We will lobby to present to the podcast, preferably with samples at the ready.\n- - We will community vote on names and run raffles or contests for early taste testers.\nMonth three will be the final decision of purchase strategy, deliveries, and the creation of a product site.\nMonth four is realistic padding on delivery to individuals and smoothing out any operational hiccups.\n\n  \n![Quick and ](ipfs://bafkreifohxvjqxbj7j3mmzdtwz5ufhifxaxz6lfnk3ykhuhsbitjbtlzvu)\n    \n    \n# Future plans\n- A public site will be available to the public to order individual bottles or cases.\nCrowdsource recommendations (recipes, dropshipping, etc) will be crunched for a future evolution (This is not necessary for the original whitelabel order concept).\n- The creation of a business model where the majority of income is split between the gnars treasury and a gnarsauce coffer for administration and shipping costs to facilitate future events/tacobars/skishops/and other adoption fun stuff.\n- FoodNOUNS will be approached, but this would not rely on their infrastructure.\n\n# Goals\nAn excuse for a fun gnarsauce label and bragging rights.\nEat yummy tacos and spicy pho after a hard gnarly day.\n(the dream) Using our extensive network to make our own unique sauce, funding further projects and athletes.\n\n# About Geffenz\nLongtime board sports enthusiast, slightly mellowed with age. I taught snowboarding in Tahoe, but now attend more online board meetings than first chairs sadly. Still! I make it to a mountain for some powder every year. I've been on the NFT scene since the beginning and have a healthy collection of gnars and noun derivatives (ok mostly gnars). I’m fucking psyched to do this for the sheer enjoyment of having our own hotsauce gnars label! My initial intent is to spend all funds on execution not personal profit, with an eye to a sustainable business model in the future.\n\n# Mottos\nDon’t be drunk just be drinking.\nDon't sweat the small stuff and everything is small stuff.\n!settle",

      "title": "[Prop 30] - Skatehive's Decentralized Sponsorship Proposal To Gnars DAO",
      "content": "Both Gnars and Skatehive are web 3 communities building their dreams on the blockchain.\n\nGnars via their DAO, are funding extreme athletes (skateboarders included) and Skatehive, via their content creation community on [Hive](https://hive.io/), are educating skateboarders worldwide on how to monetize their content in an un-censorable environment. \n\n - *Some of Skatehive's self-funded achievements:  Online [Games of S.K.A.T.E](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@skatehive/skatehive-x-lbry-cyber-game-of-s-k-a-t-e-contest-registrations-are-open), [giveaways](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@howweroll/dollar50-hive-giveaway-how-daryl-rolls), [rewards for contests](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@howweroll/the-longboard-hive-we-re-sponsoring-a-race-in-the-philippines-ep-3), [events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CleCnNLc4M), helping skaters buy new equipment!*\n\n - *Learn More About Skatehive : [Welcome to Skatehive](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@skatehive/welcome-to-skatehive)*\n\nSkatehive has been around since late 2017 early 2018 and our primary focus is onboarding skateboarders to web 3 the easiest way, educating them about blockchain and partnering up with various projects so we can make more blockchain tools available to the skateboarding community.\n\nOur decentralized ethos can't be questioned since we're building our community with commitment and passion for almost 5 years, surviving bear markets and rewarding skateboarders with hundreds of dollars weekly thanks to the trust we've earned as a community on Hive blockchain!\n\nWe at Skatehive believe Gnars is showing the same Web 3 ethos and after various talks Skatehive Council (knowhow92,web-gnar,howdarylroll,vlad) decided to draft this proposal so we can start bridging those 2 communities together.\n\n### SKATEHIVE Proposal to GNARS\n\n#### Decentralized Sponsorship\n\nThis model is another disruption of the traditional sponsorhip model. Instead of supporting one skater at a time we are going to use blockchain power to support a network of skaters by dPoS curatorship.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/dgr7Z23/GNARS-prop-fin.png)\n\n\n**GNARS INJECTION**\n\n\n[Gnars](https://peakd.com/@gnars) account on Hive buy 3 ETH worth of Hive, stake them and vote on skateboarding posts inside Skatehive community.\n\nThanks to Hive's tokenomics, no Hive tokens leave the Gnars wallet when it's account upvotes skate content. Hive token rewards are coming from the Hive \"Rewards Pool\", a pool filled daily with newly minted Hive. The more Hive Power(staked Hive) a user has in their wallet, the more Hive tokens they can \"take\" from the Hive Reward Pool and give to posts they upvote.\n\nAs discussed in [Discord Forum](https://discord.com/channels/928811922244137020/1038086773106032720/1038086773106032720) we are going to ask 3 ETH for swapping for HIVE.\n\n3 ETH ~ 10000 Hive ~ $0.20/vote \n\nVotes might look small compared to the initial investment but the more votes Gnars account gives to content the more returns it gets thanks to Hive tokenomics.\n\nUsing the price of Hive at 0.36, Hive's current token supply, as well as the average of curation rewards over time, we'd say Gnars account can get between 5.574% and 7.353% APR depending if we look at the last 30 days during the bear, or the last 138 days.\n\nThis doesn't include price changes, or the fact that HP is actually compounding as Gnars account receives curation rewards.  Or the 3% paid out in interest to HP holders nor the author rewards from Gnars account posts which would actually make the apr, or apy much higher, but we admittedly just don't know how to calculate that.\n\nAn average estimation would be around 10-11% APR for an initial 3 ETH investment. **Keep in mind that those Hive will never leave Gnars hive account wallet** and they just keep giving, to both the community and Gnars wallet.\n\nKnowhow92 can take care of posting from Gnars account on Hive as well as curating skateboarding/extreme sports content.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HcLz6Il.png)\n\n\n---------------\n\n### Additinal Benefits\n\n - Gnars can support athletes without spending money from the treasury.  Not everyone can be sponsored, but using curation we can support as many athletes as we want, while also empowering athletes to support each other as a community.  \n- Incentivizing grassrooots marketing, by monetizing content creation from all community members.  What could be better marketing, then everyone being rewarded for their efforts, and leading by example. \n- Community ownership: Everyone has a sense of having skin in the game, which encourages better community behavour. Also, no one can take what we've built away from us, if we end up ruffling feathers in the big tech social media monopoly.  \n -  Expandable model for the future of all sports communities.  Example: Surfers can post in [SurfHive](https://peakd.com/c/hive-141964/created) and also get curated by Gnars and Skatehive Upvote\n - Gnars partnership mention in [\"The Weekly Stoken\"](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@stoken/the-weekly-stoken-26) Newsletter 📰\n - It's social media without all the bullshit 🍻\t\n - Create a Weekly Curation Report from Gnars account. 75% of post rewards goes to Gnars account and 25% to @skatehive.\n \n ------------\n \n# Win-Win\n\nSkatehive wants to be the social aspect of Gnars, a place where GNARly skateboarders share their content and earn crypto for doing so and also ensures that Gnars is not just present in web2 but also lives the web3 social media, making the community more decentralized in this aspect\n\nWe will provide Gnars fam with Skatehive guides on how to create Hive accounts, subscribe to Skatehive and start posting as well as 24h support in our Discord if they need any help.\n\n\nThis is how many Hive tokens Gnars account has in its wallet with 0 investment and 6 posts. \n\n###### Gnars Hive account managed by @knowhow92\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4M64BUu.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BO9ZaYG.jpg)\n\n--------------------\n\n### Learn more about Skatehive\n\nFor any aditional info about Skatehive feel free to join our [Discord](discord.gg/skatehive) and contact any of Skatehive @staff or contact us in [Gnars Discord](discord.gg/gnars).

Ever since the pandemic started, mountain biking has seen a huge spike in popularity all over the country and has gone from having only several spots to ride to over 10 popular local trails and two bike parks. Taiku seeks to become a hub for outdoor enthusiasts by having bike trails, hiking trails, yoga & wellbeing activities and also building \"glamping\" tents, pretty cool if you ask me. \n \n![404ce9ec-92e3-44eb-b4b3-6fe2a5f8004e.JPG](ipfs://bafybeidnxjjn7g6sgwv7gv3ad2nfciuvvzmke62farjuxo7vqfk3l5jsyu)\n\nThe owners of Taiku are friends of mine, so when I approached them with the idea of having a trail sponsored by GnarsDAO and showed them what the community is all about (nouns, lilnouns, etc) they loved it. \n\n## Ask\n\n**I am requesting 2.5 ETH to develop and build a trail sponsored by GnarsDAO with features featuring the signature noggles and _allow the community to propose ideas on what to name the line._** \n \n![fdac11f0-b58d-4c29-9a03-26e83d267288.JPG](ipfs://bafybeidhwsifihnfgwl27xfwwdxbl7kc6unam7oa562fseex6of235r3au)\n\nThese are rough drafts of ideas we have had to feature the noggles through the trail. All wooden features (drops, berms, etc) will have the noggles painted on them making it a true nounish trail. \n\nTaiku has already hosted the first downhill race ever in the Dominican Republic and it was freaking cool.

      "title": "Sponsor children from TPM NGO to surf",
      "content": "![](https://i.imgur.com/CJZdTPk.png)\n\n## Project Overview\n[TPM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17PxWdPZVDTHwklMzVLqbn_ucQqq-qYFp/view?usp=sharing) (All to the Sea) is an NGO that emerged as a feminist collective in 2016 in the community of the Bay of Maracaípe-PE, Brazil. Since then, it has been contributing to the personal and social development of children, adolescents and women, through social and educational activities, having surfing at the main core. Currently TPM attends about 70 children from 7 to 17 years old with a team of 8 powerful women and it has several projects. You can read more about [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17PxWdPZVDTHwklMzVLqbn_ucQqq-qYFp/view?usp=sharing).\n\n## Why\n\nMaracaípe is one of the main routes for surf competitions in the Northeast region of Brazil and it has a beautiful landscape that attracts tourism and culture around the surf scene, which makes a good oportunity to proliferate Gnars culture thought Include Surf TPM's project. Include Surf has the mission to give children in need the oportunity to stay away from drug traffic by keeping them entertained with surf. It's also a place where they can eat and learn how to read and write in  Portuguese, Spanish and English. However most of these children are illiterate and ended up having to work on the street to bring food to their family. Nevertheless surf is a strong social transformer, providing notions of citizenship to complement school studies and work oportunities.\n\nUnfortunately TPM is going through the toughest financial crisis ever and it might close next year if they don’t find funds in time. Therefore we belive that Gnars has a huge fit with the project and can help some of TPM’s monthly cost. This sponsorship will allow these children to have fun Nounifing TPM, to surf and to learn all about web3 and it's potential with nfts, games and much more. In addition, to better these childrens lifes, nounifing TPM will attract people and companies from Maracaípe and all around Brazil that are interested in helping the NGO.\n\n## How\n\nSurfguru and Play4Change DAO are going to be key partners to proliferate Gnars and educate TPM about web3.\n\n[Surfguru](https://surfguru.com.br/) is the largest wave forecast website of Brazil, it has the largest surfing community of Brazil with 300k passionate users and 2.5M visits per month. Surfguru is also involved in the web3 with the influence of it's business partners [Luiz Hadad](https://ecency.com/hive-141964/@luizhadad/stoked-to-join-gnars-dao) Gnars athlete and [@marinioac](https://www.instagram.com/mari.salles_/) that just got 0.5eth from Lil Sisters and 0.5eth from Nouns BR to sponsor TPM's children. Recently, SG launched [DROP](https://surflimpo.cambiatus.io/invite/5w2AoW), a social currency to motivate and reward beach clean ups and created the [Surfhive Community](https://ecency.com/hive-141964/@luizhadad/stoked-to-join-gnars-dao). Since 2020, SG gives 10% of member's income to help save the oceans. Since 2021, SG have been helping fund some of TPM's activities and supplies, such as workshops on how to repair surfboards, purchasing lycra to protect from UV light, purchasing chocolate for Easter, purchasing presents for Christmas, providing material for beach clean-ups and much more.\n\n [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JtMxPWdZ_juMJUnTepK4VWjjpW3us74E/view?usp=share_link) is a video about Surfguru's 2021 impact report.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZwI7b9B.jpg)\n\n\nSurfguru will create educational content about Gnars, Lil Nouns, Nouns BR and Nouns, and also will make content about the web3 educational process at TPM and will continue to spread TPM nounified content though it's midia.\n\n\nWe will also count with the support of [Play4change DAO](https://www.play4change.io/) to teach about web3, NFT, games, Nouns DAO and the SubDAOs to TPM’s children and Educators.\nPlay4Change is an ImpactDAO, that has the mission to create positive impact in the world. Impact DAOs are essentially organizations created to make an impact on issues where society already suffers great losses such as education, health, environment, etc. They aim to drive shared interests, public goods and common needs.\n\nWith that in mind, Play4Change will educate 5 multipliers from TPM:\n- The basics of web3, exchange, wallet, nft, discord and twitter.\n- What is a DAO, subDAOs and CC0. Especially Nouns, Gnars, Lil Nouns, Nouns BR and Lil Sisters.\n- How to make money playing games in the blockchain (play2earn games)\n- How to post articles on [Surfhive Community](https://ecency.com/hive-141964/@luizhadad/stoked-to-join-gnars-dao) to have an alternative web3 income\n- How to transform Nounified drawings and photos into [NFTs](https://campanhas.mercadobitcoin.com.br/metaverso-chapadao)\n[\n](https://campanhas.mercadobitcoin.com.br/metaverso-chapadao)\n\nThis education process will guarantee the Nouns proliferation to be continued in TPM.\n\n\n# **Gnarly action**\n\n## Budget\n\nWe already got 0.5eth from Lil Sisters and 0.5eth from Nouns BR. If we get 2.5eth from Gnars, we will be able to afford the following:\n\n#### 1.75 Eth for TPM\n- Fund part of TPM’s monthly cost for 3 months (rent, bills, payrolls, food, educational supplies, surf supplies and transportation)\n- Produce all sorts of nounish noogles artwork (stickers, arts and crafts) with TPM’s children to promote Gnars, Lil Sister, Lil Nouns and Nouns BR to the Brazilian community though TPM's and Surfguru's media.\n- Organize [Play4change](https://www.play4change.io/) workshops for TPM’s children and educators\n\n#### 0.5 Eth for [@marinioac](https://www.instagram.com/mari.salles_/)\n* Manage the funding and the whole project: the content making, the workshops production, the stickers production, artworks production, and the media distribution plan on TPM's and Surfguru's medias, such as Instagram, SG website and twitter. \n* Connect TPM's coordinators, educators and children with web3, twitter spaces, discord, proposals, wallet, trade, NFT, Gnars, Lil Nouns, Lil Sisters, Nouns BR and Play4Change.\n\n#### 0.25 Eth for Surfguru\n* Media distribution to +300k users with banners, newsletters, articles and to +30k instagram followers with reels, stories and live with marinioac and Nuala Costa about the experience to be funded by Gnars, Lil Sisters and Nouns BR. All in Portuguese.\n\n## Timeframe (3 months)\n\n### 1st Month - Education and kick off:\n- Week 1 - Plan the Nounification of TPM and the education of web3 with TPM, @marinioac and Play4Change\n- Week 2 - Fund part of TPM monthly cost, such as bills and educational supplies \n- Week 2 - Make Noggle stickers\n- Week 3 and 4 - Organize a workshop with [Play4change](https://www.play4change.io/) for 5 multipliers from TPM about web3, NFT, Nouns, Gnars, Lil Nouns, Lil Sisters and Nouns BR (action continues)\n\n### Month 2 to 3, Deep Nounification:\n- Make a lot of gnartwork with the children, such as drawings, arts and crafts with paper and plastic residues to make the noggles during the TPM classes to ware them during the surf activities.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RJRAysA.png)\n\n- Make a big noggle on the sand with sand and another one with surfboars to shoot from above with a drone\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tmkZPxB.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MkAegqb.png)\n\n\n- Apply the noggles stickers on surfboards, around the TPM's house and around Maracaípe's town.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rsdCKyT.png)\n\n- Photos and video making of all the activities to post on social medias\n\n### Proliferation strategy:\n- Week 1 and 2 - Launch the project to Nounify TPM to the surf community with an article, social media post on instagram and twitter and a newsletter about the whole project to SG users base.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/D0Oz0j7.png)\n*Surfguru Newsletter*\n\n- Week 3 and 4 - Coverage on social media of the educational process and artwork making with reels and stories. [Here](https://www.instagram.com/p/CkRaVTUjVg4/) is an example of reels.\n\n- Week 5 - Reels and an article about the results of the educational process. [Here](https://surfguru.com.br/conteudo/conheca-o-sistema-que-te-da-em-troca-de-lixo-2022-10-10-27974.html?utm_campaign=2022_10_20_sistema_recy&utm_medium=email&utm_source=RD+Station) is an example of article.\n\n-  Month 2 to 3 - Continue to promote gnarly nounish media (photos, gifs and vídeos) on TPM and Surfguru’s networks, websites and social medias\n\n\n\n\n\n# **Further Information**\n\n### TPM promotes:\n\n- Social-educative accompaniment \n- Democratization of surf\n- New perspectives of life\n\n\n### Nuala Costa idealizer of TPM\n\nNuala started her surfing career at the age of 16 in Maracaípe through a social project. She was the first woman to professionally represent the state of Pernambuco in national and international surf championships. She had her surfing career invisibilized, due to racism and class difficulties, unfortunately present in the sport. She lived in Europe for 15 years and when returned found a precarious scenario in the community. Thus, she decided to start a project of surf inclusion, and founded TPM - Todas para o Mar (All to the Sea).\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xAbuVGv.png)\n\n_Nuala Costa_\n\n\n\n### TPM’s projects and actions\n\n- Include Surf TPM: Since 2016, the project Include Surf from TPM is using surf as a democratization and a social transformation for children in need.\n- Surf Day: TPM surfing experience modalities, since 2017 that challenges women, of any age, to new experiences.\n- Maraca Surf Festival: Annual women's surf competition event, featuring several TPM surfing experience modalities, since 2017.\n- TPM Mangue Woman Project & Suape Forum: Capacity-building for the political and productive organization of fisherwomen, affected by the Suape Industrial Port Complex.

He spent his adolescence traveling between events and cities in Brazil, getting to know the most different states and habits of Brazil.  \n \n![skate.jpg](ipfs://bafkreia2zsooiyp7727wuna4wwu4whhcc6idx64oestrb33m33gsk2sec4)\n\nHe skated for some sneaker brands over the years like Nike SB, Ous and New Balance Numeric and had several appearances in big Brazilian video channels, websites and in the main Brazilian skate magazines.\nToday he is the founder and head of [Essência Skate](https://www.instagram.com/essenciaskate/) and a skater for [Disturb](https://www.instagram.com/disturbepicapparel/) \n\n![Whats-App-Image-2022-11-10-at-12-43-10-3.jpg](ipfs://bafkreifg6tufvk4dgvuwira6o577ni5aou3mrp42wpyzyyplfg2vf5sujq)\n    \nHe graduated as B.A. in Advertising and produced two independent videos together with  while in college named \"Soul Skatista”. With releases in [2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIQxtFGPrIs&t=32s) and [2017](https://youtu.be/rnL15zgYDKg?t=420) he acted as a skater and filmmaker for both. Both videos were finalists for MIMPI (International Skateboard and Surf Film Festival). In 2018 he skated for [Ruexistência]( https://youtu.be/-cDTE3a87eE) video by Renato Riguetti. \n \n![Whats-App-Image-2022-11-10-at-12-43-11-1.jpg](ipfs://bafkreibgnkcyhyjryxorzdlgo5ztc36ss262gooos44wsy3ia5akahq4sy)\n    \nIn 2015, in the midst of a scenario where there were no skate brands from Rio de Janeiro, he founded Essence. The skateboarding brand is now nationally recognized as one of the most acknowledged of the hood. As the head of the company, he has produced numerous campaigns, collections, and events over the years. Also introduced skateboarders in the skate market, produced their own authorial decks models, and managed new collabs with existing crews from the scene. \n \n![Whats-App-Image-2022-11-10-at-12-43-10-1.jpg](ipfs://QmbeX7T5pdyF1FDV9xizXaAcXXpNYcC5UCe5FMQRTdfaoB)\n       \nIn 2020, he released the brand's first collective video called [PARFUM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqTDNRLDacg&t=28s), aired in the main Brazilian street skateboarding media. The video was produced by Gibson and shows footage of several skaters, including himself, performing high level tricks. By the end of the year he is about to release another skate video by brand named “Entorpessencia” and a documentary named “Resistance and Existence in Skate Parks”. Besides these, he will also release a major documentary about the history of XV Square, one of the main skate squares in Brazil, where [Gnars is sponsoring the annual event held in place](https://snapshot.org/#/gnars.eth/proposal/0xb63306dbfe950dd9754d5edcf8f48c6ff9bdd32eeeff4c644cb90c974a3055fa).\n\n![Whats-App-Image-2022-11-10-at-12-43-01.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidve6ubpikgvgbnkdlkobljzyfea7d5iyn3bnfdtvvm4y3k2deyt4)\n    \nGibson is currently a regular trader and entered the crypto market in 2017. In 2019 he founded a group named “Jovens Crypto” that aims to help lay people to understand crypto and its dynamics. Opened also 3EC Financial Moves mentorship in 2020, which focuses on scalp trading and identifying market reversals, with its own setup developed over the years.\n\nIn 2022 he founded unBLOCK, a company that through technology empowers artists and companies that want to enter on web3. He is the financial operator of the company, which recently launched its genesis collection with the artist Talita Persi. Today, besides unBlock and Essence, he manages his time between filming, skateboarding, events, and the web3 ecosystem as a whole.\n\n## Nounish track record\n \n![mosaico-jp1.jpg](ipfs://bafkreidbedc5kvfui76d3hoi5h7rsledatsmmwkdo76tcec2eztdv6cj74)\n           \nGibson’s recently organized an event at Providencia Favela at Rio.

      "title": "Locals Only- A Short Proposal",
      "content": "![](https://i.imgur.com/vNxNwca.jpg)\n\n### **Description**\n\nLocals Only will be a 2D animated short to be used as the 5-7 minute pilot episode for the creation of a complete animated series. The show is a TV-14/TV-MA rated comedy based around Duke, Flip, and Cam, three surfer beach bum friends in the fictional, Southern California surf town, Tidal Shores. They spend their days hanging out in their old, beaten up, van parked on their favorite locals only beach, La Playa Del Sol, drinking, smoking, talking shit to shoobies, and of course, tons of surfing.\n\nAs artists, we create content in the form of illustrations and animations that provides entertainment to our viewers. We see this as our own personal alternative to creating skate videos, for example, because this is something we are great at and love sharing with the world. Bringing laughter through comic relief and slapstick humor in animation presents itself as a great opportunity to bring a unique perspective to the Gnars community.\n\n### **Tone**\n\nLocals Only features similar humor and animation styles as compared to various shows such as Beavis and Butthead, Family Guy, Rick and Morty, Brickleberry, and Jay and Silent Bob’s Super Groovy Cartoon Movie.\n\n### **Sponsorship**\n\nWe are seeking a 7 ETH sponsorship to make one, 5-7 minute short animation of Locals Only. The funding will be used accordingly to ensure all artists, actors, and parties involved are compensated appropriately for their hard work and dedication to the creation of this pilot episode.\n\nEach of the 7 members of the team will receive an equal payment of 0.75 ETH. 50% of the payment will be distributed to each individual upon receiving Gnars sponsorship and the outstanding 50% will be sent out after the animation is complete. From the remaining 1.75 ETH, 0.75 ETH will be held if we need to hire another artist or voice actor. If no further assistance is required, payments will be bumped up to 0.85 ETH per team member. The final 1 ETH will be used exclusively to cover submission fees for the various film festivals we will be submitting to.\n\n### **After the Short**\n\nAfter the completion of this short, we will be submitting Locals Only to as many animation film festivals as we qualify for in order to be presented to as large of an audience as possible. Along with submitting to the festivals, we will be inquiring to pitch the series concept to various studios in hopes of creating a complete animated series. A variety of episodes have already been discussed for the future series and we truly believe that the sky’s the limit for how many episodes could be created. Our dream would be to have the show as a weekly, episodic narrative, bringing people back on a regular basis to find out what kind of shenanigans our characters will get into next. We also plan to share the animation on YouTube and a variety of other social media platforms to maximize our viewers.\n\nConversations have already begun about one of the local, Denver skate shops potentially co-screening the Locals Only animation as part of their video premiers. This will not only give us the opportunity to screen our film on a semi-regular basis, but will also expose the Gnars project to a huge community of skateboarders which we believe could be very impactful.\n\n### **What about the Gnars?**\n\nThroughout the Locals Only short, we will be featuring some of our favorite Gnars CC0 artwork in the form of stickers/artwork on the main characters van, graphic tee shirts on characters, surfboard logos, background graffiti, and whatever else we can think of to help get some of the amazing Gnartwork to a whole new audience. With the short being submitted to film festivals around the world while we simultaneously look for series pitch opportunities, many people will be able to see our homages to the Gnars we include in the animation. For our private screenings, we will include the Nounish-Gnars video at the end of our animation to help spread the word of Gnars and answer any questions people might have at that moment. We will also take that intimate opportunity to raffle off some Gnars from our personal collections we have been growing. Aside from presenting the Nounish-Gnars clip during private screenings, we will also include a permanent credit to the Gnars community for the sponsorship for all showings, including the film festivals. If the short does get picked up for a full series by a studio, we pledge to continue to include nods to the Gnars family, where applicable, in the animations in the form of hidden easter eggs, similar to how Bud Lite referenced the \"noggles’’ in their 2022 Super Bowl advertisement by hiding them on a painting in the background.\n\n### **The Creators and Locals Only Team**\n\n*Brett a.k.a. Pin.Pusher - Producer, Director, Writer, Animator, Character Designer*\nBrett has been creating cartoons for most of his life. He has always been writing stories and coming up with characters for them from a young age, but his artistic career really started in 2016 after moving to Denver, Colorado. Countless street art characters, gallery shows, and murals later, these opportunities have taken Brett around the United States painting murals and doing pop up shows in a handful of different states. Brett returned to college in 2018 in order to pursure his love for cartoons and obtain a degree in 2D Animation. He is now in full swing creating looping animated gifs, writing stories, and creating new characters on a regular basis in hopes of creating a series of his own one day.\n\n*Jake a.k.a. Guts - Director, Writer, Animator, Layout Artist, Background Designer*\nA lifelong creator, Jake has explored many mediums in his art career. Starting off young, Jake would draw everything from cartoons and elaborate scenes. These drawings quickly turned into murals and gallery work as an adult. Jake is also the host of his own graffiti/hip hop themed podcast with another season in mind. He has always aspired to be an actor and stand-up comedian. Over the last few years, Jake and Brett have worked on countless collaborative artworks together, both digital and physical works including gif animations, murals, story writing, and canvas paintings.\n\n*Josh a.k.a. Mimer - Composer, Music and Sound Designer/Editor, Storyboard Artist*\nJosh is an old school hip hop cat with a background in freight graffiti. He got into graffiti in the early 1990s and fell deeply in love with hip hop culture. He began making and performing his own music in the 2000s and started exploring his canvas paintings around the same time. In 2020, he started pursuing full production, audio formatting, and mastering of a few different music genres along with more recently experimenting with creating his own custom sound effects to assist Brett with some of his past gif animations.\n\n*Alexander Cuenin - Scriptwriter, Animator, Editor, Storyboard Artist*\nAlex is a writer, director and animator who got his start making short films when he was young. After studying and making live action films for six years, both personal and professional projects, he then turned to learn 2D animation at the Rocky Mountain College of Art + Design. Alex has edited video essays professionally for the channel “Hello Future Me” (July 2019 - May 2022) and is currently the sole editor and animator for the shows “Tale Foundry” and “Worldsmiths” (since October 2020).\n\n*Greg Cipes - Voice Actor*\nGreg is best known for his roles as the voices of Beastboy in Cartoon Network’s “Teen Titans” series and Michaelangelo in Nickelodeon’s “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles”. Greg has also had plenty of other voice and live action roles in shows and movies such as “Astroboy”, “Fast and the Furious”, Ben 10\", and “Star Wars- The Clone Wars”. Aside from being the voice of many popular cartoon characters, Greg is also the co-founder of Bright Moments DAO which is recognized for their CryptoCitizens and being an NFT art gallery pioneering how art is being co-created & co-consumed around the world. More recently, Greg has co-founded the NFTv Network which is looking to bring the power of television creation to the people that enjoy it. Find out more about the NFTv Network here [NFTv Network](https://www.nftvnetwork.com/) and [NFTv Labs](https://nftvlabs.com/home)\nAlso check out this incredible article [NFTV Web3 TV Network Is “Old School MTV Meets Adult Swim”](https://nftevening.com/nftv-the-web3-tv-network-thats-old-school-mtv-meets-adult-swim/)\n\n*Heath Hyche - Voice Actor*\nHeath began his acting career in the mid 1990s appearing on sketch variety comedy shows. This show was titled \"Saturday Night Special ‘’ in which he co-starred alongside Roseanne Barr, Kathy Griffin, and Jennifer Coolidge with guest stars who included some of the biggest A-List celebrities in the late 90s. He also worked on a similar show in the 2000s called \"Blue Collar TV’’ featuring stand-up comedians, Jeff Foxworthy, Larry the Cable Guy, and Bill Engvall. He also had a small role in \"Man on the Moon ‘’ starring Jim Carrey and Danny Devito. Being around these other actors he worked with during his career and having the opportunity to experiment with ideas has helped turn Heath into a specialist of creating characters which he uses to this day in his own stand-up comedy acts.\n\n*Nascha a.k.a RobotFishGirl - Voice Actor*\nNascha has been in the entertainment industry for her entire life. Starting off with commercial roles for Disney and Universal at age three and working for Disney in various roles as she got older. She did everything from performance to administrative work every single year throughout high school. In college, she channeled a lifelong talent for impersonation and language into voice acting. Primarily working in the video game world, she helped bring to life dozens of characters from modded Skyrim companions to World of Warcraft orcs.\n\n***MAY HIRE ADDITIONAL ARTISTS/ACTORS AS NEEDED***\n\n### **The Main Cast**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PQIFnBW.jpg)\n\nDuke - Name homage to Duke Kahanamoku, father of modern surfing. Mid 20s. Born and raised right there by the beach. Duke is fairly tall, has shoulder length dirty blonde hair that is unkept. Blue eyes and fair skin that has been sun tanned. Duke just wants to surf all day and literally doesn’t care about anything else. He has lost almost every job so he gave up even trying to get a real one anymore. Duke usually can’t hold a relationship because surfing always comes before anything, sometimes even before food! Secretly he sings beautifully, but it is very uncommon that it happens. When someone hears his voice, they fall in love with the sound. But he doesn’t give a shit. Duke has weed on his person at all times, even while riding the waves.\n\nFlip - Name homage to Filipe Toledo, Brazilian surfer. Mid 20s. Flip’s family is from Brazil, but he was also born and raised in this small surf town. Physically, he is slightly shorter than Duke. He has olive/tan skin and brown hair which he usually has pulled back into a bun while he surfs. Flip also wears a necklace made from shells. He loves surfing just as much as Duke, but he always wanted something more from his life. He always had a dream of being a talk show host. Usually Flip has an alcoholic drink of different variations in his hand, but he is almost never seen drunk.\n\nCam - Maybe short for Cameron? No one really knows his origin at all. In fact he doesn’t talk much either. He is their cameraman and the shortest of the three. His brownish-red hair is usually covering his face. When asked a question, he either shrugs, shakes his head or some other indication of his responses. He surfs just as much and also partakes in smoking and drinking, but someone always has to offer it to him. He normally uses an old flash camera, but he recently found a vhs camcorder after some shoobie got drunk at the beach one day not too long ago and was arrested leaving it behind. He is also secretly a closet genius.\n\n### **What’s Next?**\n\nTogether we have the full story written for the Locals Only short animation completed and have made final revisions to the script. Initial character designs such as turnarounds and expression sheets are being worked on, as well as background designs. Post-sponsorship, more in depth character breakdowns will be completed. Secondary and background characters, along with storyboards, and final landscape designs will also be completed. At this stage, a theme song will be created. General music and sound effects to be used throughout the short will be mixed. Preliminary vocal recordings will also begin.\n\nOnce all those steps are complete, the team will take the storyboard, music, and preliminary vocal recordings to create a test animation before creating the final artwork, adding all the color, fine details, and final sound tracks.\n\nUpon the finalization of the pilot, we will be working further with Greg Cipes, one of our voice actors. Greg has been working at Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon for over 10 years, helping bring to life some of the most beloved cartoon characters and has grown quite the following during this time, over 100k combined between his Twitter and Instagram. He has also been attending Comic Con’s around the country doing panel talks, signing autographs, and taking photos with his many, many fans who cosplay as the characters he has voiced over the years. Aside from him being a voice actor and the co-founder of the well-regarded Bright Moments DAO, Greg is also the founder of the new NFTv Network. This platform is being used to help gain exposure and opportunities for upcoming and established animators in the NFT world and beyond.\n\nWe will be more than happy to share the sketches, storyboards, and plenty of other fun behind the scenes things with the Gnars community once the final animation is complete. We don’t want to give away too many spoilers!\n\nIf you have any questions at all, please feel free to send me a dm on Twitter [@pin_pusher](https://twitter.com/pin_pusher)",

In 1997 there were no friendly architecture or good skateparks in Rio. The only good place was where the emperor used to live (Praça XV) cause it had european archteture, also as its located in downtown every bus line ended there, therefore in 1997 all the skaters of the city started to meet there until they released a law that forbid Skateboarding and Biclicling in public squares \n\nAfter years of protests we got to change the city law and I love XV became the most influent skateboard culture event in Brazil.\n\n+1000 skaters attend to the event which by tradition starts with a huge Skateboarding parade.  \n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0WPuEbI.png)\n\n\nThe local community started to gather every monday in a place called Circo Voador and then we started a serie of protests along with the GO SKATEBOARDING DAY that would become I LOVE XV event in the future, here is our timeline.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/J4QNcvs.png)\n\nHere is a more complete information in our last year presentation deck: \n\n https://www.notion.so/coletivoxv/I-LOVE-XV-39cba0ce718040988b15d7839d828d19\n\nPraca Xv is Brazilian LOVE Park, but where Love Park failed we prevailed \n\n\nEvery year its a struggle to get sponsorship for the event, Brazilian brands suffer with the market and the support we get from the city is always efemerous and we can never rely on. \n\nOur idea is not only to pay for the event but also build a permanente obstacle in the main spot of Brasil, from this relationship and presence, create and friendly onboarding enviroment to skaters to understand web3, daos, nfts and Gnars Dao\n\nGnars Dao would become its main sponsor\n\n# Gnarly Actions \n\n## 1.

The ETH will be allocated as follows:\n* **0.5 ETH** - for developing gnarly branded helmets, jackets, shirts and gloves for the riders.\n* **1.5 ETH** - for accomodation (rent and meals) during the tour for the riders.\n* **0.5 ETH** - for fuel for the riders.\n* **0.5 ETH** - video and photography.\n\n**Some samples of what to expect:**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/apL7HgD.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xrta0ra.jpg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/A59mlI8.jpg)\n\nThis is one of the moves we are making to build and grow the GnarsAfrica (Gnarfrica) community, starting with Uganda and East Africa.\n\nThis grant will have a big impact towards the Uganda Riders Association if the Gnars community sees it fit to grant us this opportunity.\n\n**Links to the Uganda Bikers Association website and socials:**\n* Website: https://ugandabikers.org/\n* Twitter: https://twitter.com/bikersuganda?lang=en\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/centralridersclubug/\n* TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@ugandanbikers\n\n### Thank you for your consideration!

Over the course of the next month Kate will publish nounish content to her followers to help proliferate the meme and bring attention to Gnars and Lil Nouns. Kate and her videographer/boyfriend Jay are skilled content creators, so this is an awesome opportunity to bring highly creative nounish content to a ton of new eyes. Kate has done brand deals with Hyundai, Walmart, Away Travel, Pandora Music, Igloo Coolers, Blenders Eyewear, and most recently Nike, and has grown her following on tiktok to over 320k and instagram to over 111k. We hope this is just the beginning of our collaboration with Kate!\n\nCheck out Kate on tiktok and instagram @rollinwithkate\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifi2jggpbdb47dfjdykazvmsrj74bzhvcvw4axxrxanyyhlvofqdm)\n    ",

      "content": "![](https://i.imgur.com/mCJpIsC.jpg)\n*Photo by [Andy Haroupias](https://www.instagram.com/andy_haroupias/)*\n\nHey everyone, some of you may know me already but if you don't... My name is Haris Housos or Knowhow92 in the crypto world and this is my sponsor proposal for Gnars.\n\n### [](https://hackmd.io/@knowhow92/SkmEM-AWj#A-few-things-about-me \"A-few-things-about-me\")A few things about me\n\nI am 29 years old, born and raised in Greece and been skating for more or less 18 years! In 2019 I quit my job to go full-time Web 3. \n\nI am a full time content creator on Hive blockchain ([my blog](https://peakd.com/@knowhow92)), [Skatehive](https://peakd.com/c/hive-173115) community Founder & Community Manager, investor and Board Member of Gnars DAO.\n\nWhen I was younger I used to ride for Vans Greece and Propaganda, a greek skateboarding company, been on many skate tours but a few years ago I left all corporate sponsors so I can skate without obligations and rules.\n\n-------------\n\n### [](https://hackmd.io/@knowhow92/SkmEM-AWj#My-work-on-chain \"My-work-on-chain\")My work on chain\n\nI got involved into crypto back in late 2017 during the previous bull run and oh boi I got REKT haha!\n\nThis didn't stop me from exploring the blockchain though and as I dived deeper and deeper I realised that blockchain and crypto is the answer to SO MANY existing problems so I started building on it.\n\nI founded \"[Skatehive](https://peakd.com/c/hive-173115)\", a community on Hive blockchain where skateboarders get rewarded with crypto and later down the road I met Vlad, Daryl and web-gnar and built skatehive into what it is today, a global skate community with people from all walks of life.\n\n-   *[discord.gg/skatehive](http://discord.gg/skatehive)*\n\nSince then we organized many contests like this HUGE online [Game of S.K.A.T.E](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@skatehive/skatehive-x-lbry-cyber-game-of-s-k-a-t-e-contest-registrations-are-open), [giveaways](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@howweroll/dollar50-hive-giveaway-how-daryl-rolls), [events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CleCnNLc4M), help community members with [medical bills](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@skatehive/update-donations-for-mr-danilo-more-than-dollar400-raised-and-we-keep-going) and educate skaters on how to buy new equipment through the crypto they earn for posting their content inside our community.\n\n*[The Origins Of Skatehive](https://peakd.com/hive-173115/@knowhow92/the-origins-of-skatehive-skateboarding-community)*\n\nYou can pretty much say I'm a \"crypto-holic\" and always on the look our for new opportunities involving blockchain.\n\n-------------\n\n### [](https://hackmd.io/@knowhow92/SkmEM-AWj#Gnars-Sponsorship-proposal \"Gnars-Sponsorship-proposal\")Gnars Sponsorship proposal\n\nLike most athletes, I ask 3 ETH for 6 months (one time paid or 0.5 ETH monthly, don't mind). I will deliver GNARly content on a regular basis on both Web 2 (IG,Twitter) and Web 3 (Hive,Publish0x) social media, represent GNARS everywhere by wearing GNARS merch and film a GNARS'ly video part by travelling all around Greece/Balkans while onboarding people in our community at the same time.\n\n**3 ETH = Around 4k**\n\n- **1k to Pay my bills and expenses for the next 6 months**\n\n*A dude's got to survive right? Hehehe! As a full-time content creator, having a few more $$ in my wallet means I don't have to hustle extra-hard with content so I will be able to skate more and worry less about paying my bills.*\n\n- **2k for Travelling/filmer expenses for the upcoming GNARS'ly video part**\n\n*I am currently working with 2 filmers, [Andy Haroupias](https://www.instagram.com/andy_haroupias/) and Mpiltzi (no social). Andy works with HD footage and Mpiltzi with OG [VX crispy one](https://www.skatehype.com/v/crispy-street-clips-ioannina-city-ftr-crew/13850.htm)!*\n\n*My GNARS'ly video part will be exclusively filmed by Andy in HD but I will also try to deliver a few crispy edits in interlaced footage with my homie Mpiltzi.*\n\n*These 2k will be spent on paying Andy, gas and hotels while I'm travelling, buying boards, shoes, GNARS merch from the official store and anything else I need/will need for my filming missions.*\n\n- **1k for My work for Gnars Dao**\n\n*I am already running [Gnars Hive account](https://peakd.com/@gnars), earned Gnars Hive account more than 30$ worth of [Hive](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/hive) in less than 1 week, promoting Gnars to skateboarders and investors on Hive and am down to help with anything community related needed.*\n\n-----------\n\n### Let's get GNARLY\n\nI find GNARS an excellent project full of like-minded people so I'd love to be a part of your athletes squad, homies! Even though Greece is small the internet is vast and web 3 social my playground so expect some sweet GNARS promo!\n\nMy social\n\n-   [My Blog](https://peakd.com/@knowhow92)\n-   [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theocharis_ch)\n-   [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/haris_housos/)\n\nSome of my latest projects\n\n- *[Haris Housos 'Knowhow to play' part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuA-_EQDbng)*\n- *[Haris Housos \"Rollin Above Talking\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75jYOR5Bd_M)*\n- *[untitled street | FTR CREW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtokVUC61HQ)*\n- *[fTR:Light Me Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvVT9Dr6RDQ)*\n\nCheers everyone and thanks in advance for the love and support",

      "content": "![](https://i.imgur.com/YE6Yae7.png)\n\n## About me\n\nAloha guys, I am Luiz Hadad, brazilian, 33 years old, surf since I was a little kid and have been on the blockchain world since 2017, working as a community builder in different projects, such as cambiatus.com. \n\nI am a partner at www.surfguru.com.br , Brazil's biggest online surfing community and forecast website, with 300k unique users and 2.5M visits per month. I lead the web3 movement there and we recently launched a social currency to [help clean our beaches](https://surflimpo.cambiatus.io/invite/5w2AoW).\n\nWhen I got into crypto, I was able to get flexible working hours and dedicate myself to my biggest passion: spend time in the ocean chasing swells and surfing big barrels - as you can see on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/luizhadad).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cKtnaq3.jpg)\n\nI live in Espirito Santo, a brazilian state with heaps of different slabs - they are the gnarlier types of waves: heavy, fast, hollow and shallow. In front of my house we have 7 different types of slabs - waves that break in different conditions. \n\nOne of them is called Avalanche - probably Latin America's heaviest slab - this wave used to be a myth when I was a teenager, and became popular around 2016 when people started using jet skis to surf it (tow-in). This wave breaks at about 3km from the coast - and you can see it from my apartment.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xLLKVBq.png)\n\nThis [video shows](https://www.instagram.com/p/CdorBROL8m3/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=) my first avalanche wipeout touching the rocks, it was a heavy one.\n\nLast year I became the first surfer to be accepted as a member of the [NXF Bodyboard](https://instagram.com/nxfbodyboard) collective, a crew of heavy wave hunters. \n\nWe're constantly surfing slabs and creating content about it. In april this year we created our [first NFT collection](https://madnfts.io/creator/nxf-bodyboard/) to experiment and learn how we could engage with web3 communities to support our movement.\n\nWe were the first ones to register an epic session in a new slab this season, called 2012\n\n> [Watch \"2012\" Baixa do Navio Fantasma - NXFTv Episódio #5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5LPvqm3mcQ)\n\nWe also hosted meetups about NFTs and big wave surfing, getting in touch with the community, sharing our experiences and learning from their feedback.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5WfXBiz.jpg)\n\n[NXF Instagram](https://instagram.com/nxfbodyboard) | [NXF Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtWEVMmxUuoRXPm8w4ZFlhQ)\n\nApart from the slabs, we also have Regencia, a great place to get barrels that is only 2 hours away from Vila Velha (my city). I love spending time there.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4QbY9EQ.png)\n\nWhen the surf season is off in Espirito Santo (from november until march), we have the fishing season. Fishing can become pretty radical when you catch  marlins.\n\nWe catch and release them, and it's pretty radical to take them for a swim before the release.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/irccKMC.png)\n\nDuring the off-season, I also like travelling to places like Fernando de Noronha, aka as \"Brazilian Hawaii\" to get some blue barrels.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jTtnOAI.jpg)\n\n## Web3 community building\n\nI've been involved in blockchain conferences since 2018. I've helped organize few of them, and I am constantly speaking at events. \n\nIt would be awesome to spread the word about gnars and help our community grow.\n\nI helped organize Ethereum Rio 2022 and Ethereum SP 2022.\n\n> [Watch Ethereum Rio 2022 | Tools to build desirable futures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD1c1ms8Pl0)\n\nThis year I was the [opening speaker at Ethereum Rio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD1c1ms8Pl0). I spoke how we could use web3 tools to build desirable futures.\n\nI spoke in two meetups related to NFTs and big wave surfing, organized with the NXF crew.\n\nI was also a panelist about impact DAOs in the Blockchain Rio Festival\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TKk63n8.jpg)\n\nI love to participate in beach cleanup events - and I am currently working with some projects that reward people with crypto to engage more volunteers.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8PN18f8.jpg)\n\n## Sponsorship proposal\n\nI'd love to become a gnars athlete and ambassador. I think 3 ETH for 6 months is a nice way to start - hope we can build a long term relationship.\n\nMy focus will be on producing content and representing gnars in different events - from beach cleanups to web3 events.\n\nSurfguru.com.br will also be a partner in this iniciative, sharing news, reposting content on social media, and raising awareness about gnars in any other ways we can think about.\n\nI'll get stickers to put on my board and all the other avaliable merch to represent gnars anywhere I go.\n\nCheers!\n\nThanks @VladHZC for helping me review the proposal and for introducing me to the gnars community!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1oEPgyq.png)",

      "title": "Nounifying Brazil and Web3 Workshops in communities of Rio de Janeiro",
      "content": "> Should we as Gnars DAO submit this proposal to Nouns DAO?\n\nNounify the skate lane in the Gigoia Island community and onboard 120 teenagers – from 11 to 14 years old – to web3 at the *[Skate Cuida Institute](https://www.instagram.com/skatecuida/?hl=pt)* - both in Rio de Janeiro.\n\n**Why?**\n\nAccording to [Statista](https://www.statista.com/), **Brazil is the 2nd country with the most people using NFTs (5M users).**\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/d7fhQsI.png)\n\nRio de Janeiro stands out as a crypto hub. In June, the 1st international NFT event in Brazil took place in the city. Gathering renowned Brazilian artists, collections of different styles and lectures about web3, NFTs and DAOs, NFT Rio showed the potential of the Brazilian market.\n\nThe Nouns DAO featured as one of the main collections during the event. [After the approval of proposal 98](https://nouns.wtf/vote/98), [@beautyandpunk](https://twitter.com/beautyandpunk), [@leoclark](https://twitter.com/leoclark) and [@fabioseva](https://twitter.com/fabioseva) did a great job spreading the noun culture at the conference. We want to further develop this work.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mohS5HA.png)\n\nFor this, the plan is to:\n## 1) Promote 4 educational workshops about web3 in Gigoia Island, Rio de Janeiro/RJ.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/x4A8LV0.png)\n*Bob Burnquist with the teenagers from the Skate Cuida Institute*\n\nThe workshops are divided in 4 stages:\n**a) Wallets and tokens:** first, a “magic trick” makes money disappear… and reappear inside the pocket of an attendee. The instructor explains what are “the secret crypto words”, how they can “control magic internet money”, and how anyone - even kids - can earn, use or store such money.\n\n**b) NFTs:** the instructor shows attendees how digital wallets can hold other digital stuff. A series of these valuable things have been scattered through the Skate Cuida Institute (QR codes linking to a minting page). A treasure hunt leads attendees to earn their first NFTs.\n\n**c) DAO:** the instructor shows a site where they can use their NFTs as tickets to join a club. He tells them there is a proposal there where they can vote for a prize that will be distributed either to half the “club”… or to all of its members - depending on how they vote it. The instructor reveals the results (awarding a prize in crypto to every participant) and teaches basic concepts in cooperation and game theory. He tells the audience the workshop was sponsored by a “club”, too - NounsDAO - that collaborates online to do cool stuff in the real world. And incites attendees they can do the same via the club they now belong to.\n\n**d) Skate & Lunch:** to wrap things up, Bob Burnquist invites the kids for a ride on the Institute’s track, then **food and drinks** are served for all.\n\nWe plan to bring 30 kids in each workshop. The goal is to **introduce 120 people to crypto and NFTs** via Nouns DAO.\n\nThe end goal is to find a format ([presentation here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFHzoOmwAE/OhifeRzHPUSLD7X1YLORVQ/view?utm_content=DAFHzoOmwAE&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishpresent)) that can be replicated in other communities in a cost-effective way.\n\n**The workshops will be conducted by guiriba, a member of Paradigma Education**. Paradigma is a crypto research house in Brazil with experience ranging from [materials for beginners](https://paradigma.docsend.com/view/vzysv4pg3evfqry9) to courses to [analysis for experts.](https://app.paradigma.education/feed/post/view?id=kru2M8m98ePrweKAjXeu)\n\n## 2) Nounify the skateboard track of Gigoia Island, Rio de Janeiro/RJ.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5iJAROf.png)\n\n***Left:** [Bob Burnquist at the skate park](https://oglobo.globo.com/rio/bairros/niteroi/noticia/2022/06/bob-burnquist-leva-projeto-social-para-o-caramujo-em-niteroi.ghtml). Right: the Brazilian version of Skater Noun was created by [Ozzz](https://twitter.com/ozzzmabro), member of the [Mafriends](https://twitter.com/MafriendsArt) collective.*\n\nWhile the workshop takes place, Nouns artwork by Brazilian artists will be painted at the Skate Cuida Institute, where classes are taught by Bob Burnquist.\nWe will bring a film crew and later deliver a clip registering the workshops and painting action.\n\n## 3) Make a donation to the Skate Cuida Institute.\n\nPurchase 3 VR headsets and 3 notebooks for the institute, to support the 4 weekly encounters currently held there, where kids receive cognitive training, skateboarding lessons, food and a safe space to play.\n\n### What is the Skate Cuida Institute and who is Bob Burnquist?\n\nBob Burnquist is the greatest X-Games winner in history.\n\nA Brazilian skateboarder & ex-videogame star, he now  aims to empower unprivileged communities through sports, education and technology.\n\nSkate Cuida Institute is a place in Rio with modest infrastructure where Bob and his team receive dozens of youngsters a week to study and skate together.\n\nBob is also avowedly a crypto-native. In 2021, he launched his first NFT collection, [Burnquist Gold.](https://twitter.com/bobburnquist/status/1446965292836524039) A fan of the Tezos blockchain, Bob has also experimented with Ethereum.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5hWMyOY.png)\n\nSource: [Viva o Rio.](http://vivario.org.br/bob-burnquist-oferece-oficina-de-skate-no-parque-esportivo-e-social-do-caramujo/)\n\n### **What is the motivation for Nouns DAO to fund the proposal?**\n\n1) To foster web3 proficiency among teenagers from Rio de Janeiro communities.\n2) To bring Nouns culture to young people having their first contact with the world of NFTs.\n3) To seek media exposure in newspapers like O Globo, with [more than 25M readers and 185M monthly views](https://oglobo.globo.com/politica/o-globo-foi-jornal-mais-lido-do-pais-em-2021-25376960); and social media like that of Bob Burnquist, who has more than [160K followers on Twitter](https://twitter.com/bobburnquist) and [770K on Instagram.](https://www.instagram.com/bobburnquist/)\n4) Create a cc0 educational material for communities around the world, allowing anyone to translate it and use it to teach web3 to children using Nouns.\n\n### **How much will the action cost?**\n**1) 3.5 ETH for the web3 educational program at the Skate Cuida Institute.**\n \n- 1.2 ETH: airdrops for the attendees during the 4 workshops (120 x 0.01 ETH per person). The amount in ETH sent to the teens will be done via Polygon. A local business will be on the location, selling snacks and accepting crypto as payment.\n- 2.3 ETH: event expenses:\n\t- 1 ETH for instructor’s transport and accommodation: will be 4 weeks traveling from Minas Gerais to Rio de Janeiro. He will travel to Rio de Janeiro every week, just to give the workshops.\n\t- 1 ETH for to organize breakfast, lunch, and afternoon coffee for the teenagers to spend the day at the Skate Cuida Institute\n\t- 0.3 ETH for the costs of printing QR Codes on the skateboard track.\n\t- 0.7 ETH for to pay the instructor in charge of workshops.\n\n**2) 3 ETH for the artistic initiative.**\n\n- 1 ETH: The money will be used to pay Brazilian artists who will create Brazilian versions of the Nouns. 0.2 ETH will be paid to each of the chosen artists, making it possible to create 5 unique arts. One of them is already created.\n- 1 ETH: destined to purchase the materials used in the painting\n- 1 ETH: to the artist responsible for painting the Noun on the institute’s skate track. In each of the workshops he will be present, nounifying the skateboard track of the Skate Cuida Institute with the artists’ designs.\n\n**3) Donation of 4 ETH to the Skate Cuida Institute.**\n- 1 ETH: for maintenance of the skateboard track at the Institute while the workshops are happening.\n- 3 ETH: equipment to encourage teenagers to [learn about web3:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDuKAded86Y)\n\t- 3x AR Oculus Quest 2 (to introduce concepts of virtual worlds more easily and foster the creation of 3D art).\n\t- 3x Notebook [Ideapad 3i:](https://www.kabum.com.br/produto/254192/notebook-lenovo-ultrafino-ideapad-3i-intel-core-i3-10110u-4gb-ssd-256gb-windows-11-15-6-prata-82bs000jbr?gclid=CjwKCAjwrNmWBhA4EiwAHbjEQI7OaPM7XOhSlqUKD_bRjiN5Pf-8Ty16Ulmszeq3mRP6yCQZvgTZWxoCft0QAvD_BwE) to allow the classes that already take place at the institute to handle more students per lesson.\n\n**4) 2 ETH for film crew to cover the workshop and further publicize the initiative.**\n\nTherefore, **we require 12.5 ETH** for the execution of all the actions listed above.",

      "content": "![image](ipfs://bafkreiaqavduqreiqmhkfk2qmi5jorcoqvyc74hdzytmorbv3ioapdct74)\n    \nI'm proposing to migrate all NFT specific SEO articles from `art.haus` to `gnars.com`. \n\nThe motivation behind doing so is for **Gnars** to get the exposure of approximately 1 million yearly search appearances. \n\nDoing so involves exporting, importing and '301 redirects' which inform Google of the changes so they can adjust their search index accordingly.\n\nI'd also like to follow on from this with a weekly article targeting SEO opportunities we uncover through tools such as SEMRush.com (separate proposal).\n\nBased on AdWords paid keyword data, the organic clicks generated so far would have cost between $40k and $50k. \n\nI was planning on rebranding ART HAUS to NOUN HAUS, but since Gnars is my focus...\n\n**Here's the plan:**\n\n- Migrate all existing content\n- Rewrite gnarticles where required\n- Do all associated 301 redirects\n- Google console updates\n\n**Here's the value:**\n\n- $50k for organic google search presence\n- $3k for the associated labour to migrate\n- $2k for the required content re-writing\n\n*Approx: $55k / 37 ETH*\n\n**Here's the ask:**\n\n- $5k for search presence\n- $2k for migration labour\n- $1k for content rewrites\n\n***Approx: 5 ETH***\n\n*Note: Heavily discounted as I'd like to mostly gift the organic search presence to helping Gnars gain exposure.*\n\n*Reference: https://art.haus/blog*",

This Donation is going to help our team do an OTG launch of GnarsDAO in our local skate scene here in Uganda.\n\n1.5 ETH is to be used to purchase Skateboards, Fingerboards, Tshirts and any other gnarsDAO Merch that we shall distribute to the skateboarding society of Uganda (NOTE: Gnars street wear branded merch will be sourced from trusted gnars merch suppliers where possible)\n\n0.5 ETH will be used for shipping and import duty tax clearance to get this Merch into Uganda.\n\nThen we shall oversee an On Ground Marketing activation across the 2 mini skateparks in Uganda. \n\nWe shall use 0.5ETH to do this Marketing run (Printing Stickers, Posters, Digital Billboards and Press Conference costs) with the Local sports conference aimed at attracting Sports community to the gnarsDAO (Major Local sports news networks)\n\nWe noted that once this OTG activation is successfully done, we shall use the Media coverage to launch a GnarsDAO streetwear shoe. Where Buy 1 and 1 is donated to skateboarders in Africa.. This will be done in collaboration with Lil Nouns or Nouns. This will be discussed after the initial OTG activation and feedback.\n\nWhat we hope to achieve with this prop.\n1. Launch of gnarsDAO Africa (As a Gnars on the ground community)\n2. Create a market for GnarsDAO streetwear through Gnars fingerboards and Merch\n3. OTG work for GnarsDAO shoes and streetwear\n4. Get new athletes & artists into the DAO\n\nHere are some of The socials:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SocietySkateboardingUganda\nhttps://twitter.com/uganda_sk8bding\nhttps://www.instagram.com/ugandaskateboardsociety/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_t0bnpXIPR73eZOgV-cYKg/featured\n\nThank you for your consideration!\n\nIf you have any questions or reservations, please reach out on Discord here:\nhttps://discord.com/channels/928811922244137020/1004450678493679676\n\n🤘⌐◨-◨ 🤘\n",
