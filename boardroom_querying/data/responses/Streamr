      "title": "SIP-22: Maintain Streamr’s Strategic Fiscal Policies",
      "content": "# Background\nStreamr, like many other Web3 projects, is governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that utilizes Streamr Improvement Proposals (SIPs) to make decisions on technical and financial parameters that influence the project's growth and development.\n\nIn previous proposals—SIP-9 and SIP-14—the Streamr community approved token mints to support protocol development, growth initiatives, and rewards for the Node Operator community.  As a recap, the project has an unallocated and unminted token reserve of approximately 850 million DATA, which is the difference between current supply (1.15B DATA) and the hard cap (2B DATA). Deciding if, when, and in what quantity, if at all, new tokens are allocated from this reserve is a key responsibility of the DAO, and none of that reserve can be used without approval of the community of token holders that make up the DAO. \n\nIn November 2022, SIP-9 authorized the issuance of 100 million DATA tokens to fund development and growth over time. This funding package will be nearing depletion early next year, so now would be an appropriate time for the DAO to sign off on the next package.\n\nThis proposal, SIP-22, seeks approval to mint a further 100 million DATA tokens to continue funding project development and growth. Planned upgrades to the Streamr Network include multi-chain deployments, a native SDK, and flexible data validation which enables Streamr to embed into a much broader range of devices and applications. It also reaffirms the existing policy for perpetual Node Operator rewards at an emission rate of 30 million DATA tokens per year. In other words, in this SIP we propose continuing the two most significant fiscal policies of the project. \n\n# Project finances\nWith the completion of the Streamr Network version 1.0, the project has shifted its focus toward expanding the adoption of the Streamr Protocol. As a result, development-related expenditure has decreased, as the core technical foundations are now established. During the development phase of Streamr 1.0, monthly spending was significantly higher, but in the current post-launch phase, this has been reduced by about half. \n\nThe Streamr project has demonstrated responsible financial management by utilizing its ICO funds to deliver a feature-complete roadmap and effectively managing the SIP-9 funds, post 1.0, to extend the project's vision. The project is not under immediate financial pressure but aims to extend the current fiscal policy to maintain its growth trajectory. \n\nHow long will this upcoming package last? The time frame depends on future market conditions, which cannot be known in advance, but certainly some projections can be given. The time depends on the average future market price as well as the project’s burn rate. While we can’t know the future market value, we can to a large extent control the burn rate. At the moment, the project’s operational expenses are around $230k/month. The burn can be trimmed down if the market price is lower than expected, and on the other hand the project might spend more if the market price turns out favorable, but for the sake of illustration, let’s assume the burn stays at the current level, allowing us to calculate projections for the package’s timespan:\n\n- At an average price of $0.03, the package lasts approximately 13 months.\n- At an average price of $0.05, the package lasts approximately 2 years.\n- At an average price of $0.30, the package is sufficient for over 10 years.\n\nBased on the market conditions at the time of writing, the remainder of the previous SIP-9 package, plus a stablecoin buffer that the project maintains, this next package would begin in early 2025.\n\n# Industry standards and inflation considerations\nThough Web3 is still in its early stages, a common approach is emerging among projects to coordinate with their communities on a responsible token circulation strategy that promotes growth for all stakeholders. Treasury allocations and emission rates are typically adjustable through governance, enabling communities to adapt to changing needs. We believe that establishing a balanced fiscal policy is essential for the project's long-term success, and we are confident that our current policies align with industry standards.\n\nIndustry Examples:\n- Polygon: Recently upgraded their token to allow for additional issuance. Established a [2% annual emission rate](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/04/polygon-begins-token-swap-in-move-to-allow-more-issuance) for their POL token, for ongoing development. This model continues as needed, with the community empowered to adjust or discontinue it based on evolving requirements.\n- Chainlink: Reserved [approximately 30%](https://insights.glassnode.com/an-on-chain-distribution-analysis-of-chainlink-link/) for company development and operations. While these tokens are not part of any governed emission schedule, they are introduced into circulation as needed for growth and development, similar in effect to Streamr's proposed fiscal policy.\n\n# Future fiscal policies\nWhile we view our current fiscal policies as necessary for today, they are not intended to be our long-term strategy. The Streamr team has [communicated](https://x.com/streamr/status/1826246242978201904) the strategic importance of diversifying our development funding streams, and progress has already been made in this area, though these outcomes are not yet finalized. Additionally, the passing of [SIP-21](https://snapshot.org/#/streamr.eth/proposal/0x09f48ecc54ed68a8c8dee80ba60047e1ec3cc802ffbfad01ef0a4b2cc1db4974) demonstrates that the Web3 community can share development costs when protocols mutually benefit. Streamr’s recognition as an [innovator in the EU](https://innovation-radar.ec.europa.eu/innovator/900854424) further validates its potential to attract government investment and institutional support, highlighting the project’s value in shaping the future of decentralized data distribution. Streamr has a solid track record with successful deliveries of the [Kraken](https://www.krakenh2020.eu/the_project/consortium), [Atarca](https://atarca.eu/streamr-acknowledgement-token/), and [Tracey](https://tx.company/projects/tracey/) projects, which have collectively secured approximately 1.2 million euros in funding so far. Additionally, we have recently submitted new proposals, seeking an estimated 1.5 million euros in funding on EU related bids that leverage Streamr technology. These efforts will help ensure the project’s long-term resilience and sustainability for future generations.\n\nRegarding the Node Operator fiscal emission policy, it is expected that as organic demand for Operator services grows, emission rates will likely decrease over time. The Streamr DAO will continue to monitor and adjust these rates as needed to ensure the project's long-term sustainability, aligning with the size and growth of the Streamr project and ecosystem.\n\n# Voting Procedure\nThe voting period for this proposal will last seven days.\nImportant Notes for Node Operators: Your voting power is equal to the DATA tokens held in your Operator Contracts, including the tokens delegated to you.\n\n**Approve**\n- Approval to mint 100M DATA tokens over time to fund development and growth.\n\n**Reject**\n- Do not approve the next funding package of 100M DATA tokens for development and growth.\n\n# Proposal summary\n- Allows Streamr to continue investing in growth, development, and marketing at a level appropriate for a project of its size and prevailing market conditions.\n- For clarity, the Node Operator reward emission rate will stay the same, regardless of the outcome of this vote.\n- If not approved, the token holders will need to further debate the parameters of the next package together with the Node Operator reward emission parameters, until acceptable territory is found.\n\nWe encourage all community members to share your thoughts on the Governance channel of our Discord and participate in the voting process to shape the future of the Streamr project.",

      "title": "SIP-20: Modifications to planned 1.0 mainnet parameters",
      "content": "## Introduction\n\nThe [SIP-16 proposal](https://vote.streamr.network/#/proposal/0xf95e691103efc4ce9ebd2ed22da3df6df446f982e6e34df1180a9a5366b3060f) previously established a set of parameters for the Streamr 1.0 mainnet, and they were the best available projections at the time. Subsequent insights from testnet operations have highlighted the opportunity for adjustments to these initially planned values.\n\n## Proposed Adjustments\n\n**Alterations to the Slashing Rate**\n\n- Set the slashing rate to 1% instead of the planned 10%. Accordingly, some other parameters depend on this and should be scaled too:\n- Set the flagger reward to 36 DATA instead of 360 DATA.\n- Set the flag reviewer reward to 2 DATA instead of 20 DATA.\n- Set the flag stake to 50 DATA instead of 500 DATA.\n\n**Introduction of New Parameters**\n\n- Set the minimum delegation period to 48 hours.\n\n## Reasoning\n\n**Slashing rate and flag parameters**\n\nThe aim of penalties within the network is to deter dishonest behavior effectively, without being excessively punitive. Given the potential for false positives, it is essential that penalties remain as minimal as possible, provided they still serve their purpose in preventing misuse.\n\nExperience from testnets has demonstrated that the system efficiently identifies and excludes dishonest participants (e.g., Operators not running nodes despite having staked in a Sponsorship) in a matter of hours.\n\nWith a 10% slashing rate, dishonest participants would have to gain over 10% of their stake in the brief period before being detected to break even. This scenario would require an annual percentage yield (APY) from Sponsorship of 43800%, a figure that is impractically high. A slashing rate of 1% brings this break-even APY down to 4380%, which is still unrealistically high, thereby ensuring that lowering the slashing rate to 1% maintains effective deterrence against fraud.\n\nThe flagger reward, flag reviewer reward, and the flag stake depend on a combination of the slashing rate and minimum stake. By decreasing the slashing rate from 10% to 1%, the flag parameters also need to decrease 10x, or else the minimum stake needs to be increased 10x to keep the flag parameters the same. Out of those two alternatives, it’s better to decrease the flag parameters, as they are still sufficient to cover the gas costs of flaggers and reviewers promoting network inclusivity via maintaining a low minimum stake.\n\n**Minimum delegation period**\n\nThe forthcoming 1.0 mainnet release will introduce a minimum period for delegation. This means that delegated tokens cannot be undelegated before a certain time has passed.\n\nThis measure aims to counteract potential exploitation strategies that involve rapid cycling between delegation and undelegation to garner disproportionate returns. Establishing a minimum delegation period disrupts such strategies, rendering them impossible. Moreover, it grants Operators increased financial stability and a more predictable timeframe for utilizing the delegated funds effectively.\n\nIf you have any questions or feedback on this SIP, please join the #governance channel on the project [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/gZAm8P7hK8) to discuss.",

      "title": "SIP-16: Streamr 1.0 network parameters",
      "content": "## Background\n\nSeveral network-wide parameters play a pivotal role in shaping the operations of the incentive layer. This proposal both enumerates and provides detailed explanations for these distinct parameters, proposing an initial value for each.\n\nIt's important to note that these values are subject to modification through future governance proposals should they be considered inadequate.\n\nIn the sections below, you'll find a comprehensive list of the network-wide parameters, complete with descriptions and their proposed initial values.\n\nPlease be aware that these parameter proposals pertain to the Streamr 1.0 mainnet. In upcoming testnets, there may be variations in parameters, such as a reduced slashing percentage and shorter durations, reflecting the experimental nature of the testnets.\n\n## Most important parameters\n\n#### Slashing amount: 10%\n\nOperators will lose 10% of their staked tokens if they are found to be violating protocol rules and are subsequently removed from a sponsorship. The same penalty applies if operators decide to unstake from a sponsorship prematurely.\n\n#### Max queuing time when undelegating: 30 days\n\nWhen a delegator chooses to initiate an undelegation process, it's important to consider that the operator might not be able to promptly return the tokens. This delay can occur if the tokens are currently staked within sponsorships.\n\nIn such cases, the request for undelegation is placed in a queue, and the operator is granted a specific timeframe, as defined by this parameter, to secure the necessary tokens for repaying the delegator.\n\nShould the operator fail to meet this deadline, they may be unstaked by force from sponsorships in order to free up the required capital. It's worth noting that this timeframe should not be set to a duration shorter than the maximum penalty period specified below.\n\n#### Maximum penalty period: 14 days\n\nSponsorship creators have the ability to establish a minimum duration during which operators are required to keep their tokens staked. If operators unstake during this period, their stake is slashed. This parameter sets the longest time that can be chosen as the minimum staking period.\n\n#### Minimum operator’s own stake: 5%\n\nThis parameter establishes the mandatory proportion of tokens that operators must stake from their own holdings, as opposed to tokens they can accept via delegation from external sources.\n\nThis requirement serves to restrict the extent of leverage through delegation that operators can acquire. To illustrate, if this parameter is set at 5%, it implies that operators staking 5,000 DATA from their own reserves can accept up to 95,000 DATA via delegation.\n\n#### Minimum stake: 5,000 DATA\n\nA minimum stake per sponsorship is essential to guarantee that there are sufficient tokens available for rewarding flaggers and reviewers in the event of an operator being penalized for misconduct. Furthermore, the creator of the sponsorship has the option to increase the minimum stake if they choose to do so.\n\n#### Minimum delegation: 100 DATA\n\nA minimum delegation amount serves as a protective measure against spamming operators with very small delegations.\n\n## Flagging and voting\n\n#### Minimum stake for voting eligibility: 0.5% of total stake in network\n\nIn order to be eligible to be selected as a reviewer on flags, an operator’s value needs to exceed a certain threshold, which is intended to be distinctly higher than the minimum stake. The purpose of this is to defend against an attacker creating a large number of operators and funding them with only the minimum stake in an attempt to control a majority vote in randomly selected sets of flag reviewers. The threshold is defined as a percentage of total stake across all operators, so that the threshold automatically scales as the network grows.\n\n#### Flag stake: 500 DATA\n\nThe flag stake is the amount that operators must put at risk to flag another operator for potential protocol violations. In this case, operators are required to place 500 DATA at stake to initiate a flag against another operator if they suspect a violation. It's important to note that if the flag is ultimately deemed invalid, the operator who initiated the flag will lose the flag stake. Automated spot checks conducted by the node software flag potential violations independently, ensuring protocol integrity.\n\n#### Flag reviewer reward: 20 DATA\n\nEach reviewer who participates in the flag review process and votes for the majority result is paid a reward of 20 DATA. This reward serves as an incentive for nodes to actively engage in the validation of flagged operators within the protocol.\n\n#### Flagger reward: 360 DATA\n\nIf the flag raised by an operator is deemed valid, the flagger is rewarded with 360 DATA. This reward serves as an incentive for operators to flag potential protocol violations accurately, contributing to the overall integrity and adherence to protocol rules.\n\n#### Flag reviewer count: 7\n\nThe number of operators that are randomly selected to review a flag by inspecting and validating the work of the flagged operator, and then voting whether the flag was valid or not. The voting is stake-weighted.\n\n#### Review period: 1 hour\n\nThe duration of time that must pass between the act of flagging and the commencement of the voting process. The node software autonomously carries out reviews and votes on flags if it is selected as a reviewer, eliminating the need for human involvement during the review and voting phases.\n\n#### Voting period: 15 minutes\n\nThe duration of time allocated for reviewers to cast their votes following the review period. Similar to the review period, the voting process is entirely automated by the node software. Therefore, there is no requirement for human intervention within the specified voting period.\n\n#### Flag protection period: 1 hour\n\nIf an operator is flagged and the flag is deemed invalid, they can not be flagged again for a short period. Operators are not allowed to fully unstake during an active flag. Therefore, without this protection period, an attacker could prevent an operator from ever unstaking by continuously flagging them. This protection period gives the operator a window of time during which they can unstake if they wish.\n\n## Operator value maintenance\n\n#### Operator uncollected earnings limit: 5%\n\nOperators continuously earn rewards from sponsorships on every block. For the operator’s total value to be correctly reflected on-chain, those earnings must be periodically collected to limit the error between the recorded on-chain value and the ‘real-time’ value of the operator, which constantly changes due to uncollected earnings accumulating.\n\nNormally, the node software handles this earnings collection and maintenance of operator value automatically. The operator is responsible for ensuring that this happens by ensuring their nodes are running and the wallets of their nodes have enough MATIC to pay gas for transactions.\n\nIf the amount of uncollected earnings exceed the operator’s recorded value by more than 5%, any entity can demonstrate to the operator smart contract that the values are outside acceptable limits. The party providing such proof (a ‘fisherman’) is rewarded, and the operator who violated this margin loses a portion of their uncollected earnings. This mechanism helps maintain the accuracy and integrity of the on-chain value, protecting the interests of participants in the protocol.\n\n#### Fisherman’s reward: 25%\n\nIf it is demonstrated that an operator’s uncollected earnings exceed the above margin, the ‘fisherman’ providing the proof is entitled to a share of the operator's uncollected earnings that were included in the proof. \n\nImportantly, only the operator who violated the error margin loses a portion of their earnings. This mechanism ensures that the consequences of inactivity are borne by the responsible operator.",

      "title": "SIP-18: Policy for replacing accidentally burned tokens",
      "content": "## Background and goals\n\nSometimes tokens get accidentally burnt. There are various ways in which this can happen, for example transferring them to an address that you don’t own the private key for, or to a smart contract which has not been programmed to handle the tokens.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to enable Key Holders of multisig wallets that guard token minting to replace lost tokens upon request, if certain criteria are met. This proposal also defines those criteria and the procedure that follows a successful invocation of this policy.\n\nThe proposed criteria are limited to a few common cases of accidental burn, and don’t attempt to cover every conceivable case due to the potential complexity of verifying that the tokens actually are permanently lost. This proposal targets the common cases and aims to create a straightforward process for them. \n\nTokens lost in other ways not covered by this policy can potentially still be replaced, but that would require a separate governance decision to either amend this policy or decide about a particular case specifically.\n\n## Criteria\n\nFor a replacement of lost tokens to be possible, all of the following criteria must be met:\n\n1. The lost tokens are:\n  - DATA tokens on Ethereum mainnet, or\n  - Bridged DATA tokens on a chain where Key Holders possess the power to mint said tokens.\n\n2. The tokens were lost by transferring them to:\n  - The DATA smart contract address on the chain in question, or\n  - The zero address (0x000…000)\n\n3. A request to replace the lost tokens is communicated on project Discord or sent via email to the project contact address, along with the ID(s) of the transaction(s) in which the burn happened.\n\n4. The request is given within 30 days of the earliest burn, or within 30 days of the acceptance of this governance proposal.\n\n5. This policy has not been previously invoked for those transactions.\n\n6. The lost tokens have not been created as a result of invoking this policy during the 6 months prior to submitting the request.\n\n## Fees\n\nA fee of 5% of the total burned amount in the request is charged and deposited to the Data Fund to benefit the builder community. The minimum fee is 1,000 DATA.\n\nThe fee is split on a pro rata basis to each transaction in the request. For example:\n\nTwo burn transactions in the same request:\n- tx 1: burned 10k DATA (10% of total burned)\n- tx 2: burned 90k DATA (90% of total burned)\n\nTotal burned: 100k DATA\nFee: 5k DATA\nTotal to be replaced: 95k DATA\n\nThe replaced amounts per tx:\n\n- tx 1 gets back 9.5k DATA (10% of total replaced)\n- tx 2 gets back 85.5k DATA (90% of total replaced)\n\n## Procedure\n\nAssuming the above criteria are met, the successfully invoked replacement happens as follows:\n\n- For transparency, a notification about a successful invocation of this policy is posted on the #governance channel on the project Discord, along with the total DATA amount and a list of transactions that burned the tokens.\n\n- Key Holders mint tokens on the chain where the burn happened. \n\n- If multiple replacement requests are open at the same time, Key Holders prioritize the requests with the highest amount of lost tokens.\n\n- The tokens are transferred on the same chain and to the same address(es) that burned them. The origin address is determined by inspecting the submitted transaction IDs.",

      "title": "SIP-19: Streamr Bounties and Temporary Storage Improvements Proposal",
      "content": "## Context\n\nThe launch of the Log Store Network marks the inception of a visionary endeavour aimed at enabling decentralised custom and secure inter-system data protocols. These protocols are fundamentally powered by the Streamr Network and designed to decentralise the collection of bespoke data for immutable storage, and subsequent utility of data in destination systems that encompass blockchains. The ultimate goal is to transform signals and event data into tangible on-chain outcomes.\n\nUsher Labs has recognised the potential for such data protocols to scale Streamr Temporary Storage. It's important to note that Permanent and Temporary Storage of time-series data serve distinct purposes. Permanent Storage establishes a complete historical record of events for use within Smart Contracts and other on-chain applications. On the other hand, Temporary Storage is essential for shared analytics, enabling networks and other public good software to aggregate their custom logs and analytical data into a shared database.\n\nIn light of these insights, Usher Labs proposes a research project aimed at developing a Reporter Network to power a data protocol with the capacity to integrate trustless and on-chain usage-based billing into Streamr's Temporary Storage technology. Community Operators will have the flexibility to participate in operating Streamr Storage Nodes, thereby earning rewards for providing storage capabilities. They can also choose to operate Reporter Nodes, responsible for reporting on the performance of Storage Nodes. Furthermore, the data protocol enables $DATA to be used as a currency for billing storage, and rewarding operators participating as Reporters or Storage Providers.\n\n## Solution\n\n**Storage:**\n\nParticipating as a storage provider will involve a familiar experience for operators, as it aligns with the existing Streamr Broker Node with the Storage Plugin enabled. This means that the current Streamr Light Node and SDKs remain instantly compatible with third-party Storage Providers. To engage, Stream Owners simply add a third-party storage node to their Stream through the Streamr SDK. They can then stake digital assets into a new Smart Contract, specifically designed to manage storage balances and their reallocation to network operators. The integration requires a simple Broker Node Storage Filter Plugin to ensure that only appropriately compensated data is stored. Usher Labs will develop this plugin.\n\n**Reporting:**\n\nUsher Labs will create a dedicated node capable of subscribing to Streams similarly to the Storage Node. When an event occurs, the Reporter Node initiates a \"resend\" request to the Storage Nodes responsible for storing the data. This process behaves as verification that the event was stored. Proof of this event's \"write to storage\" is then forwarded to the Log Store. Periodically, \"resend\" requests are executed to verify the availability and duration of data storage specified by the Stream owner. Coupled with a Smart Contract to consume this pure reporting data from the Log Store, this process enables trustless and verifiable metered billing of data writes to storage and storage usage.\n\nEvery Reporter Node operates as a data relayer and receives a Bounty Reward for contributing relevant data streams to the Log Store for use within a Smart Contract. Each Reporter Node has its own Streamr stream featuring a specific identifier or metadata, allowing the Oracle function to identify the appropriate streams to query within the Log Store. An example identifier might be: `0x123.../streamr-temporary-storage_namespace_key123/owner-specific-namespace`. The use of a namespace prefix such as `streamr-temporary-storage_namespace_key123/` facilitates the parallel search and querying of common but independent data streams within the Log Store. The query outcome presents an aggregated dataset containing every message's metadata, ensuring it is verifiable.\n\n**Smart Contract:**\n\nReporting Data stored through the Log Store is ingested into a Smart Contract on an hourly basis through oracle technology such as the Gelato Network’s Web3 Function, or Chainlink Functions. Consensus is reached based on reported events through the confirmation-based consensus paradigm. Every reported event should match identical content from another reporter. Summing up these confirmations to a threshold determines consensus. Storage Nodes receive **$DATA** tokens relevant to their stored data, and Reporter Nodes earn **$DATA** tokens if their events are confirmed. The participation of Reporter Nodes is capped, and they earn reputation, ensuring their place within the restricted network. Reputation is essential for data to be included in consensus decisions and for the allocation of rewards. The consensus model is built on Proof-of-Event, requiring no stake for node participation. Invalid participation results in ejection and blacklisting.\n\n**Coordination via Notion:**\n\nAs this is a research project with a defined scope, a Notion Page/Database(s) serves as the user interface. It provides a platform for the community to discover vetted Storage Providers and Reporter Nodes. Additionally, it features a comprehensive guide on how to participate as a node operator and how to stake funds into the Smart Contract for temporary data storage.\n\n**Video & Diagram**\n\nTo further illustrate the solution, and diagram and video walkthrough can be found here:\n\n![Streamr Improvements by Usher Labs - Temporary Storage Diagram.jpeg](https://file.notion.so/f/f/1ba339e1-ec4d-4c25-b0be-b85f0cde7ac2/1a692b7c-e4f1-4bc4-8f90-81502d8b808f/Streamr_Improvements_by_Usher_Labs_-_Temporary_Storage_Diagram.jpeg?id=dd9bac23-697a-41fc-9ad4-9d586a888e82&table=block&spaceId=1ba339e1-ec4d-4c25-b0be-b85f0cde7ac2&expirationTimestamp=1697544000000&signature=G1cJYcLkHcXx_5Q2xvMkCOWWE4FKdaNIZRZUF2t_eSk&downloadName=Streamr+Improvements+by+Usher+Labs+-+Temporary+Storage+Diagram.jpeg)\n\nhttps://www.loom.com/share/640e8310bbdd430695dd36e47b89606e?sid=9a56f6b2-eb87-4d9c-8e7f-2dada91fdf1b\n\n## Execution & Deployment\n\nThe software developed for this research project will be completely open source.\n\nUsher Labs will operate a Storage Node in Sydney, AU and Ohio, US to complement the default Streamr Germany Storage Node.\n\nNode Operators that wish to participate can follow the documented guides.\n\nReporters will need to create a dedicated stream, ensuring Log Store funding for the stream, and then operate the open source reporting node.\n\nStorage Providers will be guided through node operation, but will need to complete a form application to be listed on the Notion page so that Stream Owners are aware of vetted Operator Storage Node public keys.\n\n## Storage Pricing\n\nThe Streamr Germany Storage Node will remain free during this research project as to prevent rapid changes to user experiences.\n\nThis means that adding additional storage nodes is a means of maximising data replication for fault tolerance and data security.\n\nThe base storage fees charged to Stream Owners per additional storage node will be:\n\n| Write Request per GB | 0.2500 |\n| --- | --- |\n| Read Request per GB | 0.0000 |\n| Data Storage (GB/month) | 0.1000 |\n\nThese fees are very conservative, and are expected to increase as the project is adopted and assimilated into the Streamr ecosystem.\n\n## Funding\n\nThis proposal (SIP) enables the Streamr Community to vote on funding the research project.\n\nDue to the immediate and small nature of the scope, being a proof-of-concept, the funding request is for $7,500 USD dollars.\n\n## Voting\n\nThis proposal (SIP) will allow $DATA token holders to vote on the most appropriate way forward for the delivery of these improvements to the Streamr Temporary Storage facility:\n\n- **Approve & Fund:** Approval by $DATA token holders to commence the project.\n- **Postpone:** The proposal requires further review and will be postponed for the next governance round.\n- **Reject:** Reject the proposal.\n\n## The case AGAINST the proposal\n\n- The Streamr Network may have an alternative vision for temporary storage.\n- The proposed solution creates too much dependency on third-party technology adding a layer of security risk to Streamr Developers and Data Providers.\n\n## The case FOR the proposal\n\n- Inevitable development: To scale the Streamr Network’s temporary storage offering without any re-evaluation or deviation of existing technologies, a data protocol is required.\n- Monetisation: Streamr’s core storage node is currently a free offering because it requires a mechanism for managing usage and billing. This proposal outlines as a road to this feature.\n- (Optional) $DATA Utility: The research project can facilitate all of it’s digital asset management using the existing $DATA token, enabling a new utility for the token.\n- Community Engagement: Data protocols powered by the Streamr Network empower the Streamr ecosystem with new incentives for Community Node Operators to get involved through rewards.",

      "title": "SIP-15: Set protocol fee to 5% in Streamr 1.0",
      "content": "## Background\n\nA protocol fee is a form of value capture that allows web3 project communities to divert a share of the tokens flowing through a protocol’s economics to the related project treasury. Token holders then determine via project governance how the tokens are spent—usually to further improve the protocol and ecosystem.\n\nWith the incentive layer fully implemented in Streamr 1.0, it will now be possible to set a protocol fee for Streamr as well.\n\nProtocol fees are common in web3, and are implemented in popular protocols and dApps of many kinds, such as The Graph, Aave, and OpenSea. Typically the vast majority of tokens paid by protocol users goes to the providers (miners, node operators, liquidity providers, authors etc.), while a single-digit percentage goes to the project treasury as a protocol fee. This is in stark contrast to web2 products, where companies like Apple, Youtube, Uber, etc. take 30-55% of the revenue earned by authors and operators, creating a competitive advantage for community-run web3 protocols.\n\nDepending on the protocol, there are many actions that could be subject to a protocol fee. For example, fees can be collected from the value flow passing through the protocol, or from each staking or delegation operation, or both. To provide an example of a protocol where many different actions are ‘taxed’, The Graph collects a protocol fee from tokens earned by node operators, and additionally delegators and curators pay a fee on every transaction.\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Collect a 5% protocol fee from the value flowing through the protocol from sponsors to operators.\n- Store collected protocol fees in a project treasury.\n\nNote that future governance proposals can modify the rate, add other fees, remove fees, as well as decide what to do with the already collected fees.\n\nAlso note that the protocol fee is collected from all tokens going through the token economics, including both organic sponsoring as well as inflationary operator incentives that apply from time to time.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nIt’s important for a protocol to have a value capture mechanism which connects protocol adoption and value flow with project treasury, as this creates a sustainability flywheel where collected fees can fund further growth. This lays out a fundamental mechanism for long-term sustainability; however, it should be noted that all of web3 has quite limited adoption at the moment, and we can expect the Streamr protocol value flows and resulting fees to be quite small in the beginning (even popular web3 protocols have limited value flows, see [The Web3 Index](https://web3index.org/)).\n\nSetting the appropriate level for the protocol fee is difficult, as every protocol is different. DEXes and other DeFi protocols collect fees from the volume going through, and financial protocols typically attract heavy volume and users expect protocol fees in the 0.0x% range (Aave 0.09% for flash loans, SushiSwap 0.05%). On the other hand, infrastructure protocols and speciality dApps have lower volumes and users are less sensitive to fees, as they are expecting the software to provide a service that they need (OpenSea charges 10% on mints and 2.5% on secondary sales).\n\nThe protocol fee level should be high enough to create a potentially useful value capture to benefit the community, but low enough to not deter prospective customers or node operators.\n\nAll things considered, a 5% fee seems appropriate for an infrastructure protocol like Streamr. The fee is deducted from tokens paid by sponsors, and it has a sufficiently small effect on node operators’ earnings: In an example scenario where node operators are earning 20% annual rewards on stake for the work being done, introducing a 5% fee would drop the net earnings rate to 19%.",

      "title": "SIP-14: Set baseline issuance to 3% in Streamr 1.0",
      "content": "## Background\n\nThe Streamr 1.0 milestone will be released by the end of 2023. An earlier proposal [SIP-7](https://vote.streamr.network/#/proposal/0x483729ba13a18c5630247d57a28e02241efb47cf52b7055d27488448e1f4e22c) introduced a 2% annual issuance to be spent as incentives in the Brubeck milestone mainnet until the launch of Streamr 1.0, also defining that a new decision needs to be made to define the emission rate in the new network.\n\nThe 2% rate has been a success. Around 80M DATA is staked by node operators on the Brubeck network, earning around 25% in annual rewards for the work. \n\nIn Streamr 1.0, there are important changes concerning node operators. More active management is needed from node operators in order to allocate stake to sponsorships to maximize their earnings (although such allocation strategies could also be automated via scripts). For increased work and expenses, somewhat higher pay is appropriate. On the other hand, the milestone brings a new opportunity for node operators to scale their earnings, as they can now receive delegations and therefore potentially earn rewards beyond their personal capability to stake.\n\nThe incentive tokens are deployed through sponsorship smart contracts that incentivize node operators to relay and secure the associated streams. The allocation of tokens to specific streams is a complex topic and requires experimentation to discover what works. This proposal also suggests such experimentation to take place by the core dev team, before eventually automating the process.\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Set the network baseline incentives rate in the Streamr 1.0 mainnet to 30 million DATA / year, corresponding to a roughly 3% annual supply growth.\n- Continuous governance: allow future proposals to adjust the rate\n- Empower the core dev team to experiment with different methods of allocating tokens to stream sponsorships based on observable factors such as data volume, stream topology size, project visibility on the Hub, and other variables. The goal is to find a transparent allocation algorithm which will then be later proposed and confirmed via project governance.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nA few reasons to slightly bump the baseline issuance rate upon transitioning to the new network:\n\n- Node operators need to be motivated to onboard to the new network, so it’s good if the rewards are attractive in the beginning.\n\n- Roughly 8% of all DATA is staked in the Brubeck network—we can expect that the Streamr 1.0 network could attract an even larger share, since delegation becomes possible. This allows DATA token holders that are unable or unwilling to run nodes to participate in the network incentives. Broader participation also means that rewards per staked token may decrease if the baseline issuance stays the same. A slight increase can compensate for that.\n\n- It should also be noted that the 2% rate was set in late 2021, at the peak of the bullish market valuations, and after the 2022 crash the rewards have decreased in fiat terms. Node operators have operational expenses which the rewards need to cover.\n\nThe issuance rate should be continuously re-evaluated and adjusted to balance inflationary rewards with organic growth, operational expenses, market conditions, and other variables.\n\nAll in all, the proposed rate is quite conservative when compared to other web3 infrastructure protocols. To provide some reference points: The Graph protocol has a [3% annual issuance](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/network/indexing/), while Chainlink supply grew [more than 9%](https://coincodex.com/crypto/chainlink/) in the past year. The POKT network has gone through [multiple rounds of inflation management](https://docs.pokt.network/learn/economics/monetary-policy/) via governance to bring down the inflation rate from around 100% to 18.5%. (To be fair, the high inflation on POKT is partially explained by the fact that the inflationary tokens also fund DAO operations, as opposed to node operators only).",

      "title": "SIP-17: Top up Data Fund by minting 10M tokens",
      "content": "## Background\n\nThe [Data Fund](https://streamr.network/grants/) is the Streamr grant fund which originally got an allocation of 10M tokens (1% of the total supply) in the token launch in 2017. The Fund currently has around 2.1M DATA remaining, worth $53,000 at current market prices. \n\nThe Fund has two tracks: one for small grants of up to $5,000, and one for more substantial ones of up to $50,000. 7.9 million DATA has been spent over the years to fund various use cases, including Swash, DIMO, LogStore, BrubeckScan, many hackathon winners, and maintainers of some tech used by Streamr, such as the node-datachannel library. Most of the tokens have been spent during higher market valuations, allowing notable impact.\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Mint 10 million DATA and allocate it to the Data Fund\n\n## Reasoning\n\nCurrently the Data Fund doesn’t have much of an effect in boosting adoption as it only has 21% of its original allocation left and the market valuation of the remaining tokens is relatively low.\n\nIn 2017, around the time of the Streamr project launch, it wasn’t yet known what percentage of a token reserve should be allocated to builder grants and community growth – Streamr allocated a mere 1% for the grant fund. Compared to some newer takes on token allocation, the number sounds small. For example [Optimism allocates 25% of its maximum supply to an ecosystem fund](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/).\n\nHowever, the current DATA supply is only roughly half of its maximum supply, with most of the reserve unallocated, which gives the project a great ability to react to new information and changing conditions on the fly. Token holders can decide to allocate more tokens to the Data Fund as needed.\n\nWhile the first 10 million tokens lasted many years, clearly a 10 million DATA top-up isn’t very substantial at current market prices, and can not be expected to last an equally long period unless the valuation changes. That being said, thanks to the large reserve of tokens available to be created for whatever the token holders deem to be the most effective purposes to advance the ecosystem, it is possible to make further decisions later.",

      "title": "SIP-13: Rewards for Streamr 1.0 testnets",
      "content": "## Background\n\nThe imminent arrival of Streamr 1.0 marks a significant milestone, with an expected release by the end of 2023. In preparation for the mainnet launch, we are planning to conduct three incentivized testnets using a beta version of the Streamr 1.0 node software and related smart contracts. \n\nThese testnets serve dual purposes: they allow the community to gain experience as Streamr node operators or delegators, and they enable the development team to assess the network's real-world performance and address any issues before the official launch. The three distinct testnet periods allow the team to address problems in between the phases.\n\nFor context, during the previous milestone, Brubeck, 2 million DATA tokens were minted for testnets through [SIP-5](https://vote.streamr.network/#/proposal/QmdrrvgwjdZGrWbJLhEG9iGG7PP1FbJfw6ttqzd4J42bwb). The Brubeck testnets were active for approximately one month combined.\n\nThe Brubeck mainnet mints tokens at a rate of around 20 million DATA per year (roughly 2% annual supply increase), or 1.6 million per month.\n\n## Proposal\n\n- Mint a supply of 5 million DATA tokens for Streamr 1.0 testnet rewards. This represents a one-time supply increase of approximately 0.5% compared to the current supply or about 0.25% against the maximum supply.\n- Distribute the 5 million DATA tokens across the testnets as follows: allocate 1 million DATA for the first incentive period, 1.5 million DATA for the second, and 2.5 million DATA for the final third one.\n- Stop Brubeck rewards upon the launch of the first incentivized Streamr 1.0 testnet.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nThe primary consideration of this proposal is the allocation amount. Here are some considerations that led to the recommendation of 5 million DATA tokens:\n\nLooking back at the Brubeck testnets, 2 million DATA tokens were minted during a bull market when DATA's value was around $0.13, resulting in testnet rewards worth approximately $260,000. This incentive structure yielded strong engagement and results, suggesting that a somewhat lower amount may suffice.\n\nHowever, due to the current lower market price, a higher number of DATA tokens is needed to achieve a comparable dollar value. At present, 5 million DATA is valued at just over $100,000.\n\nEncouraging Brubeck node operators to swiftly transition to Streamr 1.0 is crucial. This not only provides valuable insights into the new network's operation at scale but also ensures that nodes engage in meaningful real-world activities on the network rather than contributing to artificial incentivized streams on Brubeck.\n\nTo motivate this transition, the community should employ a dual approach: offering a substantial 5 million DATA distribution during the testnets (with an assumed duration of 1-2 months), which surpasses the rewards available on the Brubeck mainnet (1.6 million DATA per month). Simultaneously, ceasing Brubeck rewards upon the launch of the first testnet provides an added incentive for users to make the switch.\n\nAvoiding overlapping reward distribution also has the benefit of preventing two networks from competing for the same token stake simultaneously.",

      "content": "### Background\n\nThe DATA token migrated to a new smart contract from July 2021 onwards. The old token was renamed to XDATA, while the new token adopted the symbol DATA. Any remaining XDATA tokens can be migrated 1:1 to DATA at any time and forever by interacting with the migration smart contract. 80% of token holders have already migrated to the new DATA token.\n\nSince the migration started, both XDATA and DATA have had voting power in governance decisions on Snapshot.\n\n### Proposal\n\nDrop XDATA from governance voting. If this proposal passes, those who still hold XDATA will no longer be able to vote on future proposals or submit new proposals.\n\n### The case against the proposal\n\n- XDATA holders are still Streamr supporters, even though they haven’t bothered to migrate\n\n### The case for the proposal\n\n- Passive token holders are unlikely to vote anyway\n- This is a final nudge to encourage XDATA holders to migrate\n- Cleaning up old stuff is good",

      "title": "SIP-10: Reduce DATA holders’ allocation of Data Union spin-off tokens from 40% to 15%",
      "content": "### Background\n\nAnother proposal, [SIP-3](https://vote.streamr.network/#/proposal/QmdkVWrMFSJ9bGtCk4RmHo9jNcCb3E6fHKGFg9SB4g2FUw) from May 2021, was approved to spin off the Data Union Framework product into a separate project called the Data Union DAO, aiming to launch its own token, UNION. As the Data Union Framework was initially built with Streamr funding, SIP-3 directed the spin-off to allocate 40% of UNION tokens to DATA token holders.\n\nAt the time, the crypto market was doing well and funding was more easily available. As of now, raising funding for new projects is extremely challenging and anything that seems “off” in the eyes of early backers may block progress.\n\nWe’ve been observing the Data Union DAO being pitched to crypto VCs. While they typically like the idea, they often have questions about the 40% allocation to DATA holders. The allocation seems to be too large, leaving too few tokens into the project treasury to incentivize growth.\n\nLooking back at what was decided, the VC’s are probably right. There are not many examples of spin-offs or demergers in the crypto space, but there have been a few similar cases to reflect on in the Gnosis ecosystem:\n\n- CowSwap is a spin-off from Gnosis. 10% of COW tokens were allocated to Gnosis.\n- Safe is a spin-off from Gnosis. 15% of SAFE tokens were allocated to Gnosis.\n\nWhile there aren’t enough data points to compile a statistic here, 10-15% of the token allocation seems to be an acceptable amount to ‘give back’ to the origin community.\n\n### Proposal\n\nI propose that the DATA community settles for 15% of the tokens to be launched by the Data Union spin-off. The goal is to make the spin-off project more attractive to fund and to eliminate any concerns related to the allocation to DATA holders.\n\nIt should be noted, should the proposal be approved, that the Data Union spin-off would then have more tokens in its treasury as a result. The additional tokens could then potentially be allocated to early builders and early users. By participating in the Data Union ecosystem, Streamr community members can increase their chances of getting allocation through other means in addition to the 15% share.\n\n### The case against the proposal\n\n- DATA holders will be allocated less tokens\n- In the current market conditions, the spin-off may still struggle to raise funding despite this change\n\n### The case for the proposal\n\n- The 40% allocation may be a blocker in fundraising\n- It’s better to get 15% of something valuable than 40% of zero",

      "title": "SIP-11: Increase staking cap per node to 20k DATA",
      "content": "### Background\n\nSince the Brubeck mainnet launched with incentives to run Broker nodes, there has been a maximum amount of 10,000 DATA that can be staked per node. The amount is a balance between:\n\n- Maximising the number of nodes in the network: more nodes is better for proving protocol reliability and scalability, and bigger numbers are always better for marketing :)\n- On the other hand, each node comes with fixed operating costs, so a low limit means higher fixed costs for node operators that run several nodes and therefore less profit margin\n\nWith the DATA token value hurt by the overall crypto market crash, the profitability of running Broker nodes has decreased. At current market prices, 10k DATA equals around $240 in value. With roughly 50% APR, roughly $10 will be earned per month per node. If running a node costs, say, $5 per month, half of the earnings are spent on operating costs.\n\n### Proposal\n\nIncrease the staking maximum per node to 20,000 DATA.\n\nTo repeat the above example calculation with the new cap, this would allow $480 worth of DATA to be staked per node, earning roughly $20 per month - and with the same $5 example operating cost, this means that only 25% of earnings is spent on operating costs.\n\n### The case against the proposal\n\n- This is likely to decrease the number of nodes in the network by up to 50%, as people will need to run half as many nodes to stake a given amount of tokens.\n- While the Network is enjoying constant organic growth of nodes, the total number of nodes will drop at least temporarily.\n\n### The case for the proposal\n\n- This will increase the profitability of running Broker nodes.\n- Better operating margin will attract more nodes to compensate the initial reduction in node count.",

      "content": "## Context\n\nStreamr currently does not support indefinite and/or decentralised storage for data streams.\n\nStorage Nodes are Streamr’s current solution for delivering data persistence. \n\nWhile a good solution for ephemeral data, it \n\n- lacks controlled and/or indefinite persistence\n- is centralised with a capacity for semi-decentralisation\n- requires the development of the same value propositions offered by existing & maintained decentralised storage platforms like Arweave and IPFS/Filecoin.\n\nTo decentralise persistence, incorporating existing decentralised storage platforms is an inevitable step forward for the Streamr platform.\n\n[Usher](http://usher.so/), is proposing to solve decentralised storage for Streamr by delivering integration between Streamr and existing decentralised storage/data technologies.\n\n## Solution\n\nThis solution is comprised of leveraging four technologies:\n\n1. [Streamr](https://streamr.network/)\n    \n    Necessary for transporting data anywhere.\n    \n2. [Kyve](https://www.kyve.network/)\n    \n    To securely coordinate a decentralised network of nodes, *aka. validators,* responsible for performing and validating the movement of data from Streamr data streams to a storage blockchain.\n    \n    These validators form a Kyve Pool (*[example](https://app.kyve.network/#/pools/8)*). Each validator can be an independent entity securely participating by staking via Kyve’s platform.\n    \n    Data archived with Kyve is also indexed, such that data can be [queried through a GraphQL interface.](https://docs.kyve.network/developers/accessing-data/filtering-a-query.html)\n    \n3. [Arweave](arweave.org)\n    \n    A blockchain for permanent, accessible and decentralised file storage.\n    \n4. EVM Smart Contract — `logstore.sol`\n    \n    A decentralised authority over which data streams are stored by the validator nodes. \n    \n    A value-based stake (*in ETH, MATIC, DATA, etc.*) is required to be included in the parameterised Log Store to finance the compute and storage costs.\n    \n\nBy integrating these technologies, we form a decentralised data pipeline governed by an EVM Smart Contract, such that Streamr data is moved to Arweave for permanent and decentralised storage by a Kyve Pool (*a decentralised network of nodes*).\n\n## Scopes & Objectives\n\nThe development of this solution will be separated into milestones.\n\nEach milestone will begin with a proposal submitted to Streamr’s Snapshot.\n\nThis allows the Streamr Community to vote on whether the given milestone proceeds and if it should be funded.\n\n**If the milestone is approved to be funded and funding terms & amounts have not been explicitly detailed within the given milestone proposal, a subsequent proposal to approve funding terms & amounts will be shared for open governance.**\n\nThe purpose of this proposal (SIP) is to determine whether to start the first milestone.\n\nApproval of this proposal (SIP) will set the first milestone’s scope of work in motion.\n\nThe scope for each milestone is as follows:\n\n### **Milestone 1: Proof of Concept**\n\nThis phase includes developing just enough of the solution to demonstrate that it can work within production parameters such that ingestion of data into the node network represents Streamr’s live environment.\n\nThe objectives within this scope are to develop the:\n\n1. Log Store Node — which operates the [Kyve](https://www.kyve.network/) Pool.\n2. `logstore.sol` Smart Contract\n    \n    An EVM Compatible Smart Contract that requires \n    \n    1. an arbitrary financial stake in MATIC, ETH or DATA\n    2. A list of Streamr data stream identifiers\n\n### **Milestone 2: Production**\n\nThis phase includes the development of optimisations, integrations and compatibility mechanisms that further improve UX.\n\nThis scope’s objectives, ordered in priority, include:\n\n1. A solution to improve **time to query-ability**\n    \n    The outcome allows data to be instantly fetched after being published to the Streamr Network.\n    \n    Prior to this optimisation, there will be a buffer of time between when the event is captured, and when the event can be surfaced inside of a query.\n    \n    This is due to the block times of storage blockchains.\n    \n    Nonetheless, the requirement for businesses to effectively query immediately still persists.\n    \n    The interim solution will be the continued use of existing Storage Nodes for immediately accessible data.\n    \n    The approach to solve this and unify both storage mechanisms, as discussed in the [Streamr Discord](https://discord.com/channels/801574432350928907/1031813752057757786/1034994675750277230), includes:\n    \n    1. Hot & Cold storage, whereby each validator will be required to run a Broker Node with Storage enabled. \n        \n        Validators will still be required to bundle data and store on decentralised storage (Cold store) which yields consensus about the validity of the stored data.\n        \n        To deliver on instant query-ability, each validator will effectively store a local ephemeral cache using Streamr’s existing storage technology.\n        \n    2. A new time-series query interface that unifies access to both the Hot/Cold storage mechanisms\n2. Add more Cryptocurrencies as payment methods for the Log Store solution\n3. Add Permanent Storage as a configurable option within the Streamr Core Frontend/UI & Streamr Client JS SDK\n4. Allow the existing timestamp-based event search to surface Cold Stored data — when executed from Streamr Client JS SDK\n5. Allow stored data to surface within the data explorers of Streamr’s Core Frontend/UI.\n6. Compatibility with Data Union Framework\n7. Make the validators’ Broker Nodes publicly available, as to remove the need for self-hosted Broker Nodes, but secure access to those staked in the EVM Smart Contract.\n    \n    This optimisation leverages the Hot/Cold store and simplifies access to Streamr from any software environment.\n    \n\nThe extent to which the production platform is developed and optimised will be determined by the funding amount allocated, as discussed further in this proposal.\n\n## What is Kyve?\n\nIt’s important to establish what Kyve does before diving into our approach to development.\n\nThe Kyve Blockchain is a Cosmos-based Blockchain responsible for drawing consensus on votes submitted by Validators within a “Pool”. \n\nA Validator has two primary processes:\n\n1. Deterministically produce a “bundle” of data from some source.\n2. Compare this produced “bundle” to a “bundle” that has been proposed, and then vote on whether the proposed “bundle” of data is valid.\n\nThe result is a series of validated datasets stored on Arweave or some other storage blockchain.\n\nThe key outcome occurs when these bundles are combined in chronological order. When combined, they produce a fully decentralised **append-only event log**.\n\n[Read more about Kyve here](https://docs.kyve.network/intro/).\n\n## Development\n\n### Log Store Node\n\nEach node follows the same deterministic process:\n\n1. Pull/Refresh data streams from `logstore.sol` Smart Contract.\n2. Listen to data streams\n3. Move events into a local “bundle”\n4. Kyve Blockchain selects the Node as a Data Bundle “Proposer” or “Validator”\n5. If Proposer\n    1. Propose the bundle of data, comprised of events from different streams by uploading it to Storage (Arweave)\n    2. Use the Storage ID to submit a proposal for a new bundle to the Kyve Blockchain\n6. If Validator\n    1. Download the proposed bundle of data from Storage (Arweave)\n    2. Compare foreign proposed bundle with local bundle\n    3. Prepare a vote on whether the data bundle is valid\n    4. Submit the vote to the Kyve Blockchain\n7. Clear local “bundle”\n8. Repeat Step 1\n\n### `logstore.sol`\n\nThis Smart Contract will allow anyone to create a new decentralised log store, powered by Streamr.\n\nThe user experience is like so:\n\n1. Create a Log Store by submitting a transaction with Streamr identifiers and a financial stake\n2. Receive an NFT representing ownership over the new log store.\n3. When log store funds deplete, top up your funds to continue log storage.\n    \n    Funding Log Stores is open to anyone with a vested interest in maintaining a log store.\n    \n4. Burn the log store NFT to delete the log store.\n5. Use the log store NFT to amend the log store.\n\nTo ensure funds are being re-allocated continuously, the following processes will be included:\n\n1. A validator node will be selected to notify the Smart Contract when a new dataset/bundle is validated and uploaded.\n2. Within this transaction, an Oracle Network will be tasked to bring validated metadata about the latest dataset onto the Smart Contract.\n    \n    *This may or may not use Kyve’s GraphQL interface depending on Oracle compatibility.*\n    \n3. This data is used to reallocate funds to compensate the validators accordingly.\n    \n    Price Feeds provided by Oracles, such as Redstone, will ensure fee accuracy between disparate cryptocurrencies staked and expensed.\n    \n\nStorage Costs and Kyve Staking will be managed by Node Operators participating in the Kyve Pool. Node Operators will earn funds within Kyve and a proportional amount will be reflected as fees in the EVM Smart Contract.\n\n## Fee Calculation\n\nThe stake requirement to facilitate a decentralised log store compensates the Kyve Pool Validators.\n\nFees are calculated for each log store.\n\nFees are reallocated after a given dataset/bundle has been stored.\n\nThe total fee is the sum of the:\n\n- fees incurred from data stored\n- validator rewards for facilitating storage\n- treasury fees to fund the maintenance & development of the platform\n\nValidator rewards and treasury fees should & will be governable in a decentralised manner. \n\nWhile a new governance token offers a breadth of options for scale and purpose, Kyve already offers a governance platform, and therefore, the first version of the Log Store platform will leverage Kyve’s existing governance technology.\n\nThis enables validators staking in Kyve’s platform to participate and vote.\n\n## Repository\n\nWork on the repository can be found here:\n\n[https://github.com/usherlabs/logstore](https://github.com/usherlabs/logstore)\n\n## Timeline for Milestone #1\n\n- **4 - 6 weeks**\n    - Log Store Node\n    - `logstore.sol` Smart Contract\n    - Creating Documentation\n    - Developing security compatibility with Streamr private data streams\n- **2 - 3 weeks** — additional time for:\n    - e2e testing\n    - proposal and governance management across technologies\n    - validator onboarding and coordination\n    - in case anything goes astray\n\n## **Execution**\n\nAs part of it’s research in merging off-chain & on-chain, [Usher](http://usher.so/) has devised the storage solution outlined in this proposal and will be mandated to carry out the delivery and management of the solution.\n\n## Deployment\n\nThe solution will first be deployed to testnets, such that the entire experience can be tested without real value reallocated to validators. \n\nDeployment to live networks will be proposed to the validator network upon completion of testing.\n\nUpon proposal approval, such that each validator is prepared for the live deployment, the solution will be deployed to appropriate live networks.\n\n## Funding\n\nWhile this proposal establishes a model for monetisation through treasury fees, direct funding provides an additional mark of confidence from Streamr and other interested backers. \n\nWith funding delivery of all of the objectives detailed in the given milestone is guaranteed as the requirement for immediate monetisation is alleviated.\n\n### Funding for Milestone #1\n\nThis proposal (SIP) enables the Streamr Community to vote on funding the given milestone’s scope of work.\n\nDue to the immediate and small nature of the scope, being a proof-of-concept, funding will size similar to a Streamr Network grant. That is up to twenty thousand USD dollars.\n\n## Voting\n\nThis proposal (SIP) will allow DATA token holders to vote on the most appropriate way forward for the delivery of the Log Store platform:\n\n- **Approve & Fund:** Prior to project commencement, a new proposal (SIP) will be produced to offer DATA token holders a vote on the funding amount and treasury fee share & terms.\n- **Approve:** Simple approval by DATA token holders to commence the project.\n- **Reject:** Reject the proposal and keep Steamr storage exclusively managed by the Streamr Network.\n\n## The case AGAINST the proposal\n\n- The Streamr Network has an existing solution for storage and this solution is already being developed to facilitate the value propositions outlined in this proposal, making the Log Store redundant.\n- The proposed solution creates too much dependency on third-party technology adding a layer of security risk to Streamr Developers and Data Providers.\n\n## The case FOR the proposal\n\n- Inevitable development: The Streamr Network needs a decentralised & fault tolerant integration with decentralised storage networks for permanent and/or controllable decentralised data persistence.\n- Focus: Decentralised Storage of Streamr Data (Log Store) and the Streamr Network are fundamentally different technologies, and deliver different values.\n- Empowerment: The Log Store platform becomes a self-sustaining, healthy project powered by Streamr. The Log Store also empowers the Data Union Framework to distribute larger stored & validated datasets to Buyers.\n- Retained Vision & Direction: While this new development does set a new precedent for how storage by Streamr will be managed, it does not redirect or change the network’s original vision and purpose, which is to enable a real-time data network.",

      "title": "SIP-9: Create a project treasury for post-roadmap expenses from the 100M DATA allocated in SIP-6",
      "content": "### Background\n\nIn the [SIP-6](https://vote.streamr.network/#/proposal/QmU383LMPAHdzMevcxY6UzyL5vkBaNHQhCcp2WbXw5kXS1) proposal, passed in May 2021, a supply of 100M DATA tokens was approved to be minted to raise further funding for the Streamr project to cover post-roadmap expenses. The initial project funding will last at least until late 2023, beyond the Tatum milestone, and is held safely in fiat. Arranging the post-roadmap funding is not particularly urgent but the plan needs to be revisited due to changed market conditions.\n\nAccording to the SIP-6 decision, the tokens were to be sold to crypto VCs at a maximum of -20% discount from market rates, in exchange for a 12-24 month lockup period. At the time of the proposal, DATA price was around $0.10-$0.15, meaning that this supply of tokens had the potential to raise around $8M-12M (factoring in the discount), should the price level stay stable. The idea was also to generate stable yields for the project by depositing the raised funds into DeFi pools, yielding around 10-15% at the time for stablecoin pools.\n\nClearly this was an opportunistic proposal based on assumptions that did not hold beyond the favourable market conditions at the time:\n\n- The market price of DATA has since then crashed along with the rest of the crypto market\n- The stablecoin DeFi pools now yield 0-3% instead of 10-15%\n\nThe market, as it is now, is very different. As a result, none of the 100M DATA has been minted yet, and it’s not particularly attractive to lock in the current prices or give any discounts to the already depressed market price.\n\nThe project expenses are currently around $3.0-3.5M per year. Post-Tatum, as all the main tech building blocks will have been built, spending on development and maintenance can be decreased, while the spending allocated to growth efforts and ecosystem development can be increased. In all cases, the spending must be adjusted to the available project funding.\n\n### Proposal\n\nI propose that the 100M DATA (already approved to be minted) will be used to seed a project treasury which can (only) be spent over time on project expenses from late 2023 onwards (once the initial funding runs out), instead of raising funding in advance and locking in the currently prevailing low rates.\n\nIn practice:\n\n- The tokens can be spent over time to pay project contributors or entities that host those contributors\n- The tokens can be sold over time to maintain a stablecoin/fiat buffer in advance of upcoming stablecoin/fiat expenses\n\nAs a result, the tokens will gradually float to open and efficient markets little by little through project contributors that have earned them by working on the project, not all-at-once via VCs seeking to speculate on the token. This way, the tokens are sold gradually over time, with negligible market impact.\n\nAs the downside, it’s not possible to predict how long that supply of 100M DATA will last, as it will depend on market conditions in late 2023 and beyond. In our view, it doesn’t make sense to try and draft a long-term plan instead right now. The current market conditions offer limited visibility, price levels are unattractive for fundraising, and the project still has a major milestone to reach.\n\nI propose this course of action as a bridge/medium-term funding plan to get the project safely into 2024, and then see where the project and the whole crypto space are at the time. I expect that a further decision should be made in 2024. By that time, the current turmoil will hopefully have passed and the DATA community will be able to make longer-term decisions in more stable market conditions. In addition, post-Tatum milestone, there is an opportunity to cover maintenance and growth costs from protocol fees.\n\n### The case against the proposal\n\n- This proposal doesn’t solve the long-term funding needs of the project\n- By spending tokens on expenses instead of selling them to VCs, the project won’t get additional validation and support of such VCs\n- If the crypto market further depreciates by late 2023, the supply won’t last very long\n\n### The case for the proposal\n\n- This gets the project well into 2024 and potentially way beyond if the markets recover\n- With the current market turmoil, a medium-term decision feels like a better strategy than trying to predict the future or lock in the current rates\n- Releasing tokens to the market gradually and at a rate equalling project expenses (or slower, as some recipients will keep them) avoids negative impact on the markets\n- This proposal doesn’t introduce new inflation; a 100M DATA supply increase has already been approved earlier by token holders in SIP-6, and this proposal just recycles that",

      "title": "SIP-7: Brubeck mainnet mining rewards",
      "content": "In the Brubeck testnets, participating miners were incentivized by sharing a fixed reward pool of 2M DATA across the testnets. Minting of this reward pool was approved in [SIP-5](https://vote.streamr.network/#/proposal/QmdrrvgwjdZGrWbJLhEG9iGG7PP1FbJfw6ttqzd4J42bwb).\n\nFor the upcoming Brubeck mainnet, I suggest that:\n\n-   The centralized reward mechanism built for the testnets is reused and a similar process is continued in the Brubeck mainnet\n-   To supply the mining rewards, inflate the supply at an annualized rate of **2%**\n-   The process is continued until it is replaced by the decentralized and open incentive mechanics of the Tatum milestone, expected in late 2022\n-   Participating miner nodes earn a share of the rewards based on their DATA stake\n\nThe last point differs from the Brubeck testnets, where nodes were able to join without staking. This lowered the threshold to participate, which resulted in a large number of nodes joining the network. The downside was that some people were able to cheaply run a large number of nodes, therefore claiming a larger share of the rewards as well as making the testnets more centralized.\n\nBy distributing the mining rewards based on stake, we are taking one step closer to the realistic token mechanics of the Tatum milestone, creating a token sink by locking up some supply in the stakes, and serving our token holders by enabling them to earn a yield on their holdings by participating in the mining.\n\n### Example of reward attribution\n\nAssume there are 3 nodes in the network, all doing a perfect job. Their staked DATA holdings are as follows:\n\n-   Node A: 1,000 DATA\n-   Node B: 2,000 DATA\n-   Node C: 3,000 DATA\n\nIn total, 6,000 DATA is staked. Node A earns 1/6th of incoming reward supply at any given time, Node B earns 1/3rd, and Node C earns half.\n\n### Example APY calculation\n\n2% annualized supply increase is roughly 20M DATA per year. The APYs for staked tokens depend on the amount of DATA staked in total:\n\n| **Total DATA staked** | **% of supply staked** | **APR** * | **APY** ** |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 10M | 1% | 200% | 611.71% |\n| 20M | 2% | 100% | 169.26% |\n| 40M | 4% | 50% | 64.48% |\n| 80M | 8% | 25% | 28.33% |\n| 160M | 16% | 12.5% | 13.3% |\n\n\\* assuming perfect operation of nodes, the network, and the reward system\n\\*\\* assuming weekly compounding\n\n### Maximum stake\n\nIt's beneficial to have more nodes in the network, so it's good if large token holders need to run several nodes to stake their whole token supply. For this reason, a maximum stake of **10,000 DATA** per node is proposed. From this, a minimum number of miner nodes in the network can be calculated for each scenario of total DATA locked:\n\n| **Total DATA staked** | **% of supply staked** | **Min miner nodes** * |\n|---|---|---|\n| 10M | 1% | 1,000 |\n| 20M | 2% | 2,000 |\n| 40M | 4% | 4,000 |\n| 80M | 8% | 8,000 |\n| 160M | 16% | 16,000 |\n\n*  This is the minimum; in practice there will be more nodes, as not everyone will have max stake\n\n### The inflation rate\n\n0.2% of new DATA was minted to incentivize the testnets, which ran over a course of roughly one month. That attracted a lot of nodes, perhaps even too much, for a limited period of time. Multiplying that by 12 months would lead to 2.4%, giving a rough ballpark of what an appropriate yearly rate might be. For the Brubeck mainnet, we expect a lower amount of miners, but larger and more stable income per miner. I propose setting the inflation rate for the mainnet rewards to 2%. Later Streamr governance decisions can adjust the rate up or down if needed.\n\n### Pros/Cons analysis\n\n**Pros**\n\n-   Token holders are able to earn yields by participating in the network\n-   A larger network generates valuable research data for the Streamr team\n-   A larger network validates scalability and provides great marketing value\n-   By running nodes, people are educated about the Streamr technology\n-   Some miners will convert to actual application builders, benefiting the ecosystem even more\n-   It provides a 'simulation' of what actual mining might feel like in Tatum\n\n**Cons**\n\n-   Setting up the Brubeck incentive mechanism takes some development time to build something that will be obsolete in Tatum (but most of it was already built for the testnets, so the additional work needed is not huge)\n-   Adding this incentive mechanism will make it certain that the Brubeck launch will not happen by the end of the year, but rather in January (which seems fine, as launching things close to the holiday season is not great anyway)\n-   2% annualized inflation\n-   People may not understand that they must keep their node private keys safe, otherwise they will lose their tokens\n-   Risk of confusion: this is not Tatum yet!",

      "title": "SIP-8: Move Marketplace to sidechain(s) & start multi-chain strategy",
      "content": "The gas fees on Ethereum mainnet have been extremely high for a long period of time. For this reason, creating products or Data Unions as well as making purchases on the Streamr Marketplace is prohibitively expensive. \n\nThe Streamr team has been working on a multi-chain strategy, which enables the Streamr ecosystem to be deployed onto many chains and interoperate. But this will take a bit of time to implement and deliver. In the meanwhile, a quick fix would be welcome. For this reason, I propose splitting the work into two steps - a quick win and a longer-term follow-up:\n\n- **Step 1**: As a quick fix, move the Marketplace as-is to the xDai chain. Why xDai? The current Data Unions exist on xDai, and it’s probably best to maintain compatibility between existing Data Unions and the Marketplace at all times.\n\n- **Step 2**: Implement a multi-chain approach, where the Marketplace, Data Unions, and other Streamr smart contracts will exist on multiple EVM chains, creating an ecosystem that spans across different sidechains and L2s.\n\n### More thoughts about the multi-chain approach\n\nThe Streamr Network, Marketplace, and Data Unions jointly use a number of smart contracts to operate. Ideally, they would all exist on one and the same chain, which would be scalable, cheap, and popular. In the current blockchain offering, no such “one chain to rule them all” exists, instead there are various sidechains and L2s, each with their unique properties.\n\nAs the space is so fragmented, and the popularity of different chains changes quickly, Streamr should at least build the capability to run the protocol in parallel on several EVM-based chains, and deploy the system to new chains as needed. This creates new audiences for the technology as well as provides partnership opportunities with the sidechain and L2 teams.\n\nIn the approach, basically a full suite of Streamr contracts is deployed on each supported chain. The state of each chain is then merged on the application level: for example some of your streams or products could be defined on one chain, and some on another chain. This is a little bit similar to SushiSwap for example, where a copy of the system basically exists on all chains, and you can trade or provide liquidity on the chains you choose.\n\n### Pros/Cons analysis\n\n**Pros**\n- Solves the gas cost issue on the Marketplace, both short and long term\n- Provides a multi-chain strategy and trajectory for the whole Streamr system\n\n**Cons**\n- It’s somewhat harder to get assets and use dApps on sidechains. On the other hand, gas costs on mainnet make dApps impossible to use as well\n- Sidechains are not as secure as Ethereum mainnet\n- More complexity in the overall system\n",

      "title": "SIP-6: Raise a long-term fund for Streamr",
      "content": "Every now and then crypto VCs approach the Streamr team and want to buy tokens directly from the project. However, there is no supply for additional fundraising, and neither the company nor individual team members want to sell their tokens. So we have to turn such parties away empty-handed.\n\nHowever, it could be very beneficial to the project to have such parties onboard, especially if it enables access to long-term funding for the project. One idea here could be to create a supply of tokens earmarked for raising a long-term fund to support growth and success of the project beyond the ICO roadmap, i.e. from ~2023 to infinity!\n\nCurrently, the project still has around $10M left from the crowdfunding. As planned, this will be sufficient to reach the last milestone of the whitepaper roadmap. While there’s still plenty of funding left, now is a great time for the token holders to plan for the long-term sustainability of the project and invest in it.\n\nMany projects divert some small share of revenue from their token economics to a long-term maintenance fund. This works, and is possible in the Streamr token economics too. However, for most projects the stream of funding attainable in this way is very small, especially in the beginning when the project is early on its adoption curve.\n\nImagine instead that the token holders would create a supply to be invested in yield-earning assets. For instance, if $20M is raised and locked as stablecoins into DeFi to earn roughly 10% APY, the project earns a stable $2M in yearly interest. Once the initial roadmap is built, the yield alone can be enough to cover the further development of the project, ad infinitum.\n\nHere are some detailed specs showing what the fundraising could look like:\n\n- Authorise the minting of up to 100M DATA for this purpose (5% of max supply, 10% increase to current supply) over the years 2021-2022\n- Spread the fundraising over time (2021-2022)\n- Accept reputable crypto VCs and high net-worth individuals. Full KYC/AML for everyone\n- Tokens are sold at a maximum discount of -20% from the market price at the time of agreement\n- In exchange for the discount, tokens are subject to a 12-24 month lockup\n- Only sold tokens get minted; no supply increase unless there are deals\n- Mandate Streamr Network AG to negotiate, make the deals, and park the funds into top reputable DeFi platforms\n- Use of the funds raised would be subject to Streamr governance\n- Spending the generated yields or the capital itself would always need the community's approval.\n\n# The case against the proposal\n\nMinting more tokens inflates the token supply, and could reduce the price of the token – unless the purpose of minting is perceived to have a net positive effect on the project.\n\nInvesting the funds in DeFi is more risky than keeping them in a bank account. Vulnerabilities in the DeFi platforms used could lead to losing the capital.\n\n# The case for the proposal\n\nFor most decentralized networks it takes years to grow the adoption and the size of the network, and this is likely to be the case also for the Streamr Network. By raising a long-term fund, the project’s viability would be secured beyond 2023. Moreover, VCs bring great exposure for crypto projects and add a badge of approval to a project’s vision.\n\nIn the traditional startup world, it’s commonplace to raise more than one round of capital to make a project’s vision fully come true. Equally, in the crypto space there have been a number of projects that raised funds beyond the initial ICO (e.g. [Polkadot](https://www.coindesk.com/polkadot-raises-43m-in-72-hour-private-sale-source) has done two rounds of token sales, and [Dapper Labs](https://www.coindesk.com/nba-top-shot-firm-dapper-labs-raising-funds-at-7-5b-valuation-report) raised traditional VC money besides its Flow ICO).\n\n*The key question is this: Is it net positive to inflate the supply by a maximum of 10% to have a chance of funding the project until infinity?*\n\n",

People can participate by downloading a special testnet release of the Streamr Broker node software and running it for the lifespan of the testnet.\n\nThere will be at least two testnet rounds: the first testnet will have a lifespan of 3 days, while the final testnet will run for 14 days. Additional testnet iterations may be added to the schedule, depending on whether any problems arise in the first testnets.\n\nThis proposal is about creating a pool of tokens to be mined by the testnet participants. In other words, people who successfully run a Broker node and have sufficient uptime in the testnets will earn DATA token rewards.\n\nFurthermore, it is proposed that the rewards will be based on a bonding curve, so that more nodes in the testnets means more rewards earned by each node. This incentivises existing participants to tell their friends about it and help them participate too.\n\n- The proposal is to mint a maximum of **2M DATA** for the Brubeck testnet mining rewards pool (0.1% of the maximum supply, and a 0.2% increase to the circulating supply)\n- Unutilised tokens (tokens that are not earned via mining the testnets) will never even get minted, leading to the supply increase being less than 2M DATA.\n",

      "title": "SIP-3: Launch a DAO and UNION token for the Data Union framework",
      "content": "Data Unions are a way for applications and devices to manage consent, collect data, and reward users with micropayments for any valuable data they jointly provide. Data Unions are built on a technical framework leveraging Streamr and Ethereum technologies, enabling data crowdsourcing and crowdselling at scale. The framework has been in active development since 2019 as part of the Streamr project. A new [2.0 version of the framework](https://blog.streamr.network/the-data-unions-upgrade-is-live-data-token-goes-multi-chain-with-xdai/) was recently released, with [many further developments in the roadmap](https://blog.streamr.network/whats-next-for-data-unions/) and more than 20,000+ users on the platform so far.\n\nWhile data economies and markets are nascent at the moment, they are projected to generate $13 trillion in new global economic activity by 2030, according to [McKinsey](https://hbr.org/2019/01/which-countries-are-leading-the-data-economy). Ethical and fair methods for data collection and monetization are required to enable these data economies to take off. In addition, data cooperatives and data self-sovereignty have been [identified by the European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/communities/sites/jrccties/files/micheli.pdf) as key approaches. By decentralizing all layers of the solution, the combination of the Streamr Network, Ethereum, and the Data Union framework are the perfect combination of technologies for application builders to tap into the value generated by these emerging markets.\n\n# Proposal for launching the Data Union DAO and UNION token\n\nThe mission of the Data Union DAO would be to govern and further develop the Data Union framework. The Data Union DAO would have its own token, UNION. This is what it would be used for:\n\n- Vote on governance proposals (DUIPs, i.e. Data Union Improvement Proposals)\n- Incentivise teams to grow existing Data Unions and build new ones\n- Incentivise investors to fund projects on the upcoming Data Union Springboard platform\n- Incentivise the provision of liquidity on DEXes\n- Other improvements as decided by the DAO.\n\n# Why launch a new DAO and token?\n\nBehind every DAO is a group of token holders that is incentivized to achieve a shared mission. The DAO is a decentralized decision making system that helps token holders coordinate their efforts and reach consensus through governance proposals. Achieving this mission can be thought of as the objective function of the DAO.\n\nThe core purpose of the Streamr DATA token is to power the token economics of the Streamr Network. Therefore, the main objective of Streamr governance is optimising the health and adoption of the Streamr Network. Data monetisation and Data Unions are key use cases for the Streamr Network – there is plenty of overlap in the best interests of each product.\n\nOn the other hand, Data Unions are also a movement and a mission in their own right. By launching a separate DAO to govern the Data Union framework, a clean separation of concerns can be achieved. The Data Union DAO should govern with the intent to maximise the growth of the Data Union ecosystem.\n\nThe alternative is to maintain the status quo and keep developing and governing the Data Union framework within the Streamr DAO. This has worked well so far, but the approach doesn’t really allow for a Data Unions-specific token economy to be created.\n\nVia this SIP, DATA holders get to decide via voting whether they see added value in separating the projects.\n\n# How would UNION tokens be distributed?\n\nThe UNION token should accomplish two main goals:\n\n1. Enable the Data Union framework to grow and thrive under the governance of the new DAO, and\n2. Connect UNION to the DATA token to provide DATA holders with an incentive to support the ecosystem and reward them for the work done on Data Unions so far.\n\nWe think that the UNION launch should be a fair one, meaning that no tokens go to a founding team or early investors. Instead, the Data Union framework should be completely community-owned and controlled. Therefore, the DAO should create a model where UNION tokens can be “farmed” by Data Union builders over time (based on the number of members or amount of revenue, for example). The DAO can also pay out tokens for code contributions to improve the framework itself.\n\nSo far, the Data Union framework has been developed under the Streamr project funding and DATA-based governance. In order for the community of DATA holders to approve and support the friendly fork, a share of the UNION supply must be distributed to DATA holders over time.\n\nThe share that goes to DATA holders vs. the new DAO should be chosen carefully, as there’s a trade-off. The DAO should have enough to further develop the project and reward future actors in the UNION ecosystem, while the DATA community should receive enough to accept and support the change.\n\nThis SIP allows DATA token holders to vote on the most appropriate split of the UNION supply:\n\n- **Approve 50/50**: 50% to the Data Union DAO, 50% to DATA holders\n- **Approve 60/40**: 60% to the Data Union DAO, 40% to DATA holders\n- **Approve 70/30**: 70% to the Data Union DAO, 30% to DATA holders\n- **Reject**: Reject the proposal and keep Data Unions governance under the Streamr DAO powered by DATA token\n\nIf the ‘Approve’ options combined get the majority of the votes, the ‘Approve’ option with the most votes becomes the decision. If the ‘Reject’ option gets the majority of the votes, the SIP is rejected.\n\nIn a nutshell, if the SIP passes, DATA holders will receive a share of the UNION supply for free as long as they hold on to their DATA. The tokens will be distributed via periodical airdrops to DATA holders over a period of 24 months. The amount airdropped to each address is proportional to the amount of DATA held in that address at the beginning of each airdrop period.\n\nThe DAO independently decides how to use its share of the UNION supply to advance Data Unions, with some ideas already outlined earlier in this proposal.\n\nThe UNION token will be an ERC-20 token usable across bridges on Ethereum mainnet and its various sidechains, such as xDai, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain. UNION airdrops will take place on a sidechain due to the high gas costs on mainnet.\n\n# Bootstrapping the Data Union DAO\n\nThe intention is that the new DAO starts off with the current Data Union framework and adopts its current roadmap as the starting point. Starting off with the current setup also means that Data Unions continue to use the Streamr Network to collect data and continue to use the DATA token to pay members. The setup can be expanded in the future if the UNION holders (many of which are also DATA holders) consider that to add value to the ecosystem, and vote for such proposals in the DAO.\n\nThe DAO will have funds to operate with; it will be in control of the share of UNION tokens allocated to it, as well as a $1 million nest egg provided by the Streamr project to ensure uninterrupted development of the framework. It can choose to sell some of its supply to fund long-term operations, or reward for work done in UNION tokens.\n\nIn the very beginning, no one will have UNION tokens for voting. The genesis event will be the first airdrop to DATA holders, enabling the Data Union DAO to bootstrap its governance process and get itself organized. Streamr team members, the teams currently building Data Unions, and Data Union advisors will steward the young DAO and help with the practical aspects of getting the new DAO up and running.\n\n# The case AGAINST the proposal\n\nThere are always pros and cons to everything. The key downsides of SIP-3 are:\n\n- It takes some time and effort to make the change, and that time is away from developing the products under the already established model\n- While the goals of both the Streamr DAO and Data Union DAO are aligned by creating overlap in the token holder base, the DAOs and their tokens could end up competing for attention or have conflicting interests in the long run.\n\n# The case FOR the proposal\n\nThe key benefits of SIP-3 are, as explained earlier in this blog post:\n\n- Focus: the DATA token and UNION token have different purposes, and the associated DAOs can optimise for their respective goals\n- Empowerment: The Data Union framework becomes a self-sustaining, healthy project.\n\nThe key question to answer is this: Does the new DAO and token add value and focus to the ecosystem compared to the current “one token to rule them all” model?\n\n*Is DATA + UNION > DATA?*\n\n",

      "content": "For the first two rounds of Streamr governance voting, only the Streamr team has been able to submit governance proposals. This was a temporary limitation to first get some hands-on experience with how the Snapshot tool works, and to learn what participation level can roughly be expected from the community of token holders. However, we believe that for governance to be truly decentralized, any stakeholder in the ecosystem should be able to submit proposals.\n\nSIP-4 proposes that community members are given the option to submit governance proposals by unlocking the Community tab in Snapshot. This will change the Snapshot interface to display two tabs: Core and Community. The Core tab shows proposals submitted by the Streamr team in the quarterly governance rounds, while the Community tab shows proposals submitted by other token holders.\n\nSuccessful community proposals would go through two rounds of voting as follows:\n\n1. The DATA holder adds their proposal to Snapshot. It will appear on the Community tab, and other token holders can vote on it while the proposal is open. Community proposals can be submitted at any time (not only during the quarterly Core voting periods).\n2. If the majority of token-weighted votes cast on the proposal support it, AND it is supported by at least **30M DATA**, it will be *upgraded to a Core proposal* in the next quarterly round of governance voting. Any unclarity in the proposal can be ironed out, with the Streamr team, before the Core round. As a Core proposal, it will also get full promotion on Streamr social media channels to maximise participation.\n\nTo prevent proposal spam, submitting proposals should require the person to have a minimum amount of DATA in their wallet. A low threshold is more inclusive and thus preferred, but a higher threshold could help ensure that only serious, quality proposals are submitted.\n\nThis proposal recommends that the threshold for submitting community proposals is set to **25,000 DATA**. The minimum balance, as well as the **30M DATA** acceptance parameter, can be later changed by other governance proposals, if they turn out to be too high or low.\n\n",

      "content": "[Streamr Canvases](https://streamr.network/docs/canvases/intro-to-canvases) are microservices that consume and act upon real-time data, defined in a visual drag-and-drop editor. [Dashboards](https://streamr.network/docs/dashboards) are collections of visualisation widgets extracted from Canvases. While they have proven to be useful tools in the ecosystem, maintaining and upgrading the tooling in future milestones requires considerable resources and steals focus from more fundamental efforts such as developing the Streamr Network itself.\n\nCanvases have so far been a centralized service hosted by the Streamr core team to offer a cloud-like install-nothing experience. As the whole Streamr ecosystem moves towards decentralization as envisioned, Canvases can hardly continue their centrally hosted existence. In the original 2017 whitepaper, it was envisioned that Canvases could eventually run on decentralized computation frameworks developed by projects tackling that problem (such as [Golem](https://golem.network/)), but building such frameworks has proven to be more difficult than many imagined at the time, and none suitable for running Canvases are really available today.\n\nThe proposal is to remove the Canvas feature from the Streamr Core application and the associated API. The code will be archived into a fork for safekeeping and potential later use. An example of later use could be to relaunch the Canvas tooling at a later time as a self-hosted version which would connect to the decentralized Streamr Network for data.\n\n### The case against the proposal\n\nCanvases have value as a tool to create simple automations and integrations based on data from Streamr streams, including simple centralized oracles that interact with Ethereum smart contracts. If the feature is removed, users will need to find other ways to accomplish what they need. Using alternative approaches may be harder than using Canvases, which are pretty user-friendly and approachable.\n\n![](https://blog.streamr.network/content/images/2021/02/Canvases@4x.png)\n\nStreamr canvases in the Core app\n\n### The case for the proposal\n\nDropping Canvases will improve the team's ability to focus on the essence of the project, the Streamr Network and its token economics, and speed up its delivery by eliminating some baggage that would otherwise need to be migrated to newer Network milestones.\n\nCanvases can be used to build automation, visualisations, and oracles -- but it's unlikely to ever become the best tool for any of these tasks, as better, specialised tools and methods are available to most developers and often being used by them already. For example:\n\n-   [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is a popular tool for creating data-driven automation workflows, and it [already supports Streamr](https://medium.com/streamrblog/streamr-node-red-integration-tutorial-b0b410496354).\n-   [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is a common and flexible framework for visualisations, and it could easily ingest data from Streamr streams with a suitable plugin.\n-   [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) and [API3](https://api3.org/) are frameworks focusing on connecting data to smart contracts, with capabilities that go well beyond the simple oracles that can be built with Canvases. [Chainlink already supports Streamr](https://medium.com/streamrblog/streamr-chainlink-oracle-integration-f17ee6c5462c), and Streamr is a [founding partner in API3](https://blog.streamr.network/news-streamr-joins-api3-dao-as-a-founding-governance-partner/) with an integration planned.",

      "title": "SIP-1: Token migration to enable token economics",
      "content": "In the past year or so, many Ethereum projects have gone through a token migration. While it's a somewhat cumbersome process that requires a lot of coordination with token holders, exchanges, and information sites, it gives the communities the opportunity to update their token contract to implement new standards (e.g. [Golem's GNT to GLM](https://blog.golemproject.net/gnt-to-glm-migration/)), change branding and support new features (e.g. [Aave's LEND to AAVE](https://docs.aave.com/faq/migration-and-staking#:~:text=You%20just%20need%20to%20enter,to%20migrate%20them%20to%20AAVE.)), or raise the supply hard cap to enable inflationary token economics (e.g. [OCEAN token migration to double the hard cap](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-the-ocean-protocol-token-swap-august2020-370585578d6e), setting it to the originally planned value).\n\nThe main reason for the token migration is to double the hard-coded maximum supply from 1 to 2 billion DATA.\n\nIt's very important to understand the following, so please read carefully:\n\n-   This proposal does not change the circulating supply or market cap. No new tokens are minted by passing SIP-1.\n-   For any new tokens to be minted, a separate governance proposal clearly describing the amount and purpose of the tokens must be created, and voted on by the token holders. Tokens can only be minted if such a proposal passes.\n-   This proposal is about technically enabling such decisions to be taken by token holders in the future. With the current token smart contract, minting tokens is impossible, even if the community wanted to and decided to do so.\n\n### The case against the proposal\n\nMinting new tokens in the future will dilute existing token holders accordingly. While none will be minted with this decision, the decision signals that the community wants to explore inflationary reward models in the future.\n\n### The case for the proposal\n\nA controlled inflationary pool is a powerful tool to incentivise network participation, as seen in almost all blockchain networks including Bitcoin and Ethereum. In the DeFi space, there are many examples (e.g. UNI, CRV, etc.) where minted tokens have been used to incentivise growth and energise the community, and often the growth has added ecosystem value orders of magnitude beyond the caused dilution. Token holders can also defend against inflation by participating in the related programs -- participation being exactly the goal of the incentives.\n\nSubsequent proposals will need to be drafted and voted upon for any tokens to be minted. That said, here are some potential use cases for such tokens:\n\n-   Bootstrapping the decentralized Streamr Network. Similar to yield farming in DeFi, minted tokens can act as early-adopter bonuses and help focus the community's efforts. This would also enable nodes to be rewarded already in the Brubeck phase where the Network's usage fee mechanisms don't exist yet.\n-   Rewarding DATA holders for voting on governance proposals (such as this one)\n-   Incentivising long-term maintenance and development of the Streamr codebase\n-   Incentivising long-term ecosystem growth and building of applications beyond the lifespan of the current Data Fund.\n\n### Why exactly 2 billion DATA?\n\nToken migrations require a lot of communication, coordination and resources to implement. While we don't expect the full reserve to ever be needed, the hard limit should be set sufficiently high to avoid ever having to do another migration in the future. Doubling the hard cap seems more than sufficient for all foreseeable incentive programs, even in the very long term. In practice, only a fraction of it may end up being created, but it's better to overshoot than undershoot here to avoid tying the community's hands to decide on incentive programs.\n\n### Implement ERC-677\n\nThe change to the hard cap is the only material change in the token migration. However, it is also an opportunity to do a few technical improvements which have appeared since the token launched in 2017, such as implementing [ERC-677](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/677).\n\nThis technical change will enable smart contracts to be notified via a callback function whenever tokens are transferred to them. This is useful in many situations, including moving tokens across interchain bridges, moving tokens to Data Unions, and so on. ERC-677 is an extension of the ubiquitous ERC-20 standard, 100% backwards compatible, and used by a number of well-known projects, such as Chainlink.\n\n### The practicalities of the migration\n\nIn the token migration, a new token smart contract will be deployed, and token holders can swap their existing tokens 1:1 for the new token at any time. There will be a simple UI for doing this in a self-service manner. The Streamr team will also notify exchanges and other custodial parties, and encourage them to migrate the tokens in their custody.\n\nThe new token will adopt the `DATA` symbol, while the old token will be renamed `DATAv1`. A similar approach was used in [MakerDAO's DAI migration](https://medium.com/mycrypto/makerdaos-migration-everything-you-need-to-know-c10e04a97fb2), where the new token adopted the symbol `DAI`, and the old token was renamed from `DAI` to `SAI`.\n\nYou will be able to migrate your `DATAv1` tokens at any time, meaning that there will be no particular urgency to do so, or any particular time when you need to have them in your wallet to qualify for the migration.",
