      "content": "This GIP proposes reducing the curation tax parameter in the protocol from 2.50% to 1.00%. Feedback received after launch of curation is that the cost of the curation tax may be too onerous for some network participants, particularly in instances where the subgraph needs to be upgraded multiple times due to bugs in the subgraph or due to the subgraph being under active development. This proposal significantly reduces the cost for subgraph upgrades.\n\nView the full proposal, including an evaluation of the Subgraph Withholding Attack here: https://hackmd.io/s3Fim2M8RxqWRLZ_8APuUg#\n\nFind the discussion for GIP-0013 in this Forum thread: https://forum.thegraph.com/t/proposal-to-reduce-curation-tax/2212\n\n---\n\nYou vote for the question: Do you support a curation tax reduction from 2.50% down to 1.00% ?",

These changes were presented at recent [protocol town halls](https://forum.thegraph.com/tag/graph-townhall).\n\n- [**GIP-0009**](https://hackmd.io/MMHefHW5TxOOLtqqutP-VA) proposes an Arbitration Charter to clarify the behavior of the Arbitrator in the protocol and specify additional protections for Indexers. \n- [**GIP-0008**](https://hackmd.io/FU2VmNI6QnKK9vj3bQB4MQ) proposes a strategy for specifying the canonical version of subgraph API functionality in the protocol, as well as a support matrix that defines the support level for subgraph API features in the protocol.\n- [**GIP-0007**](https://hackmd.io/5MvmhaIARw2ohq2F9xn53w) proposes separate slashing percentages for indexing and query related faults, in order to balance the slashing risk to Indexers of participating in both activities. \n- [**GIP-0005**](https://hackmd.io/Ou0goFbrQGK4uwtogh-cfg) proposes a gas costing scheme for subgraphs in order to implement deterministic timeouts for long-running subgraph handler executions.\n\nThe full text of all the above GIPs can be found in [the Radicle repo](https://forum.thegraph.com/t/gip-0001-and-getting-started-with-gips-grps-grcs-etc/1722).
