      "content": "# Simple Summary\n\nBuy back $LYRA with part of the fees generated by the protocol since the launch of Lyra v2.\n\n# Abstract\n\n\nThis proposal aims to utilize part of the fees generated to buy back $LYRA tokens before the snapshot and migration to the new $LXD token for the LyraDAO. The tokens bought will be held by the DAO until new $LDX tokenomics are finalized and approved.\n\n\n# Motivation\n\n$LYRA token has not been able to capture the value of the upgrades and scope extension provided on Lyra V2. The motivation is to redirect part of the generated fees to capture the value at current prices.\n\n\n# Specification\n\nThe proposal aims to assign up to 150,000 USDC for $LYRA token buy backs. That amount represents approximately 16.1% of the 931,000 $ fees generated by Lyra v2 at the time of this proposal.\n\n- 150,000 USDC from the Security Module to be transferred from Lyra Chain to a wallet controlled by the DAO on Optimism.\n\n- Buy backs will be executed on a daily basis during 9 days (April 29th to May 7th) by swapping USDC for $LYRA on Optimism.\n\n- Maximum amount used for buy backs will be 17,000 USDC per day. \n\n- Buy backs will be split to avoid high price impact. Maximum price impact will be 2.5% per swap.\n\n- If there is some USDC left at the end of the buy back period it will be returned to the Security Module.\n\n\n# Rationale\n\nThis proposal aims to reflect the compromise of the DAO with their stakers and return part of the value accrued by the protocol to them.\n\nThe amount of 150,000 USDC is in line with similar discussions about assigning 20% of the fees to stakers.\n\nThe maximum daily amount of 17,000 USDC for buy backs aim to use a uniform distribution for the buy backs.\n\n\n# Test Cases\n\nTest cases are required for code-related proposals (i.e. non treasury actions).\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0 ](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": "[LRFC] Update to Lyra Trading Incentives - Incentivize Maker Volume",
      "content": "# Simple Summary\n\nRevise Lyra Economics V2.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal suggests modification to the Ecosystem incentives proposed in [Lyra Economics V2](https://forums.lyra.finance/t/lrfc-lyra-economics-v2-governance-adoption-and-sustainability/142), transitioning from rewards based solely on taker fees paid to rewarding both maker and taker fees paid equally.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe current incentive structure is not producing the competitive markets necessary to maximize Lyra’s incentives and generate organic trading volume. The taker only incentives force traders to cross wide spreads from market makers, or interact with existing orders in order to get rewards or to place resting limit orders and receive no rewards for their liquidity. By rewarding both maker and taker volume equally, we aim to enhance liquidity on the order book and improve the user experience for everyone.\n\n# Specification\n\n\n**Ecosystem incentives**\n\nEffective immediately from the start of the next epoch, the LYRA DAO will continue distributing 15% (150,000,000) of incentives to traders based on both maker and taker fees paid, excluding any base trade fees. This distribution serves two main purposes:\n\n* Governance alignment: To establish a strong connection between early adopters of Lyra v2 and the DAO, aligning incentives between key stakeholders by granting ownership and governance rights in the future of the protocol.\n* User & liquidity acquisition: To attract new traders to Lyra v2 that will generate volume and fees for the protocol.\n\n150,000,000 LYRA will be distributed over 96 epochs, with each epoch lasting 7 days.\n\n**Rewards Specification**\n\nTraders are allocated a pro-rata percentage of the rewards pool based on fees paid: \n![rewards.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreig5udxmjywybijc6vw2c4nxwhhthlpmofciganlaavi453rjy7n3q)\n\nThe rewards pool will consist of 150,000,000 LYRA distributed over 24 months\n\n* Rewards are to be determined at the end of each 7 day epoch\n* Rewards will be delivered in full as LYRA after the end of each epoch.\n* In the special case of the “launch season”, all rewards will be delivered at the end of epoch 12.\n* Market Makers engaged in other liquidity mining or fee discount programs on the exchange will not qualify for LYRA rewards based on maker fees but can still earn rewards for taker fees paid.\n* Note: \"Fees paid\" does not include any minimum or base trading fees.\n\n**Growth Experiments**\n\nUp to 15% of each epoch’s allocation of LYRA rewards will continue to be diverted to bespoke incentive programs for traders.\n    \n\n# Rationale\n\nThe revised incentives are designed to reward all traders and create organic order flow to the V2 protocol and attract new participants. Market Makers are ineligible for Maker fee rewards because they are re-imbursed for maker fees paid in other programs. \n\n# Test Cases\n\nTest cases are required for code-related proposals (i.e. non treasury actions).\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0 ](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": "[LRFC] Lyra & Aerodrome - Bootstrap liquidity for LYRA on Base",
      "content": "# Simple Summary\n\nLyra is in a unique position to grow its user base and boost awareness with Lyra Chain launching soon. As an OP Stack Chain, Lyra stands to benefit by engaging with protocols and users on the growing Base ecosystem. As part of this journey Lyra can leverage Aerodrome to bootstrap $LYRA token liquidity on Base.\n\n# Abstract\nAerodrome is the central trading and liquidity marketplace on Base. As a sister protocol of Velodrome - one of the largest protocols on Optimism by TVL and users - it can deliver a similar value proposition for Lyra by serving as its primary liquidity hub on the Base ecosystem.\n\nAerodrome streams $AERO emissions to liquidity pools based on weekly veAERO (vote-escrow AERO) votes. Lyra can use voter incentives (bribes) to attract veAERO votes and AERO emissions to build liquidity on Base in a capital-efficient way.\n\n# Motivation\n\nProtocols incentivising on Aerodrome have been achieving an efficiency ratio of 2-3X. In other words, for every dollar in voter incentives, protocols are currently directing between $2-3 worth of AERO emissions towards their pools. Lyra can leverage this high efficiency to attract deep liquidity at a low cost.\n\n# Specification\n\n1. Lyra will enable bridging of LYRA to Base and [create a LYRA/WETH pool](https://aerodrome.finance/liquidity) on Aerodrome\n2. Lyra will [deposit $2K worth of $LYRA tokens](https://aerodrome.finance/incentivize) as weekly incentives for the LYRA/WETH pool \n3. LYRA incentives will run for a period of 16 weeks\n4. The Velodrome team will conduct a review at the end of the program and provide recommended optimizations to its strategy based on the performance of this pilot program and DAO priorities\n\n# Rationale\n\nDeploying $2K in weekly incentives can allow Lyra to attract up to $1M of TVL at 22% APR for LYRA/WETH. This is about ⅔ of Lyra’s current liquidity on Optimism.\n\nThe effectiveness of the voting flywheel is highlighted by Lyra’s ability to sustain $1.5M TVL at 22% APR for its LYRA/WETH pool on Velodrome using Protocol Owned Votepower.\n\n# Test Cases\n\nN/A\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0",

      "title": "[LRFC] Whitelisting Strands Deploying Address on Lyra Chain",
      "content": "# Simple Summary\n\nStrands is deploying the SFP pilot to Lyra Chain and needs an account whitelisted to deploy the system’s Smart Contracts.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWe propose adding the following Strands address to the deployer whitelist:\n\n0xd0Df1290Cbf4B1AC626026Db2bDD9bb85c17d266\n\n# Motivation\n\nStrands recently introduced the Strands Segregated Funds Proxy (SFP), a form of information representing Segregated Fund Account values operating according to the ERC-20 standard. Segregated funds are funds held in a designated account at a brokerage on behalf of the customer in accounts that are segregated and not commingled. These funds are unique in that they provide the customer with protection from the brokerage’s potential bankruptcy and other legal risks. This is essential in establishing confidence in financial markets and institutions.\n\nSegregated Funds are the foundation of modern finance. SFPs thus have enormous potential to provide critical enhancements to both traditional and decentralized finance. We want to deploy the first SFP natively to Lyra Chain. To do so, we need to deploy a variety of smart contracts and so require to be whitelisted. For more detail on our work, see our forthcoming white paper.\n\n# Specification\n\nWe wish to have these accounts whitelisted by the DAO so that they can deploy smart contracts to Lyra Chain:\n\n* 0xd0Df1290Cbf4B1AC626026Db2bDD9bb85c17d266\n\nThese addresses will then deploy these contracts:\n\n* StrandsApi.sol - An ERC-20 that represents Segregated Fund Account values.\n\n  StrandsApi.sol mints and burns the ERC-20 Strands.api when instructed to by a whitelisted actor.\n\n* StrandsSFP.sol - Strands Segregated Fund Proxy.\n\nStrandsSFP.sol allows users to deposit Stands.api and receive Strands.sfp. Strands.sfps are ERC-20 tokens that can be used for a variety of applications in DeFi, such as providing collateral on Lyra V2. Conversely, users can withdraw Strands.api when they deposit Strands.SFP. StrandsSFP.sol also handles all bookkeeping functions. \n\n# Rationale\n\nBy deploying Strands SFPs, we will give users the ability to access Segregated Fund Account values. Until now, this was unavailable to all but major financial institutions. We hope this will go a long way in solving a number of issues currently present in Decentralized Finance by providing user certainty. Further work by us will expand these offerings substantially.\n\n# Test Cases\n\nTest cases can be found here: https://github.com/Strands-Finance/sfp-pilot/\n\nThey can be run by following the instructions in the README.md.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0 ](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": "[LRFC] Launch Lyra V2",
      "content": "# Simple Summary\n\nDeploy and launch Lyra V2.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines the sequence needed to launch Lyra V2. Once the system is operating reliably, ownership of the contracts will be transferred from the DAO multisig to the on-chain governance system.\n\nThe sequence is as follows:\n\n1. If approved on snapshot:\n    1. Deploy Lyra Chain, Protocol and Exchange\n    2. Fund security module\n    3. V2 mainnet launches\n    4. V2 incentives start\n2. If approved onchain\n    1. Ownership transferred to onchain governance\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal is a follow-up to the introduction of [Lyra V2](https://forums.lyra.finance/t/lrfc-introduce-lyra-v2-and-establish-lyra-foundation/108). The remaining v2 work has been completed, and thus, it is time to seek community approval to launch. \n\n# Specification\n\nBefore describing the steps to launch, we begin by visualising the V2 architecture at a high level. This helps the reader understand the relationship between the core software components (chain, protocol, exchange), the entities that work on behalf of the DAO (governance, foundation, service providers), the different types of users that interact with the system and the flow of value back to the DAO.\n \n![architecture.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreigectas5lt2sfxliemxjerjuwvewoh42a6l26o5fak4u66ha7lryy)\n\n**V2 Components - Core software**\n\n1. Lyra Chain - Ethereum rollup built with the OP Stack.\n2. Lyra Protocol - Generalised margin and risk protocol.\n3. Lyra Exchange - Self-custodial exchange.\n\n**Entities - Work on behalf of the DAO**\n\n1. Lyra Foundation - Not-for-profit legal entity that acts on behalf of the Lyra DAO.\n2. Service Providers - Assist the Lyra DAO with various components of V2.\n\n**Users - Interact with Lyra V2**\n\n1. Lyra Stakers - coordinate Lyra governance\n2. UI Traders - access Lyra Exchange via GUI\n3. API Traders - access Lyra Exchange via API\n4. Integrators - build on Lyra Protocol \n5. Protocol builders - launch entirely new protocols on Lyra Chain\n6. Ethereum Stakers - provide the economic security to secure Lyra Governance\n\n## Deploy Lyra Chain\n\nThe first step in launching V2 is to deploy Lyra Chain.\n\n**Summary**\n\nLyra chain is an Ethereum roll-up built using the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/). It is a smart contract platform that provides a high-performance foundation for the V2 protocol whilst inheriting the security of Ethereum. To learn more about Lyra Chain, read the [introductory v2 proposal](https://forums.lyra.finance/t/lrfc-introduce-lyra-v2-and-establish-lyra-foundation/108/11) or [this blog post](https://mirror.xyz/lyra.eth/TWH07KhC61fLdMEfZ_TOkBpZPA6HFFqg0F9zvSL5R2Y).\n\n### Accessing Lyra Chain\n\nUsers can choose between the standard Optimism bridge or a fast bridge developed by Socket. Documentation for the Socket bridge can be viewed [here](https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socket-plugs/blob/main/contracts/superbridge/README.md) and [here](https://developer.socket.tech/Learn/protocol-design/).\n\n### Lyra Chain Configuration\n\n| Name | Value | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| RPC URL | rpc.lyra.finance | Remote Procedure Call for interacting with Lyra Chain |\n| Epxlorer URL | explorer.lyra.finance | Graphical interface for transactions and blocks |\n| Chain ID | 957 | Unique identifier for Lyra Chain |\n\n## Deploy Lyra Protocol\n\nThe second step in launching V2 is to deploy the V2 Protocol to Lyra Chain.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe Lyra Protocol is a series of smart contracts that collectively create a generalised risk engine, capable of portfolio margin. To learn more about the protocol, please review the v2 [whitepaper](https://www.lyra.finance/files/v2-whitepaper.pdf).\n\n### V2 Source Code\n\n| Name | Description | Link |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| V2-core | The core version 2 protocol | https://github.com/lyra-finance/v2-core |\n| V2-matching | Contracts that enable sequential matching | https://github.com/lyra-finance/v2-matching |\n| lyra-utils | Commonly used libraries in the Lyra Protocol | https://github.com/lyra-finance/lyra-utils |\n\n### Audit\n\nThe protocol was audited by Sigma Prime and the report is available here: https://github.com/sigp/public-audits/blob/master/lyra-finance/review.pdf\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe initial configuration of parameters is available here: [https://lyra-finance.notion.site/Lyra-V2-Parameters-2d02b3c941e64292b0df6b925aea31b7](https://www.notion.so/Lyra-V2-Parameters-2d02b3c941e64292b0df6b925aea31b7?pvs=21)\n\n## Deploy Lyra Exchange\n\nThe third step in launching V2 is to deploy the Exchange.\n\n**Summary**\n\nLyra Exchange is a self-custodial exchange built with Lyra DAO’s open-source matching service. It has been built from the ground up to be competitive with the world’s largest crypto derivatives exchanges (not just DEXs).\n\n### Accessing Lyra Exchange\n\nThere are two ways to access Lyra Exchange, via the client and directly via the API.\n\n1. Client - Recommended for the majority of users who prefer to trade via a graphical user interface.\n2. API - Recommended for advanced and professional traders who prefer to trade programmatically. Documentation is available [here](https://v2-docs.lyra.finance/reference/overview).\n\n### Exchange Fee Structure\n\nLyra Exchange is the initial “Risk Assessor”, which means it can apply for an alternative fee structure. This model is intended to allow exchanges building on Lyra Protocol the ability to offer pricing that is in line with popular centralised and decentralised competitors. The initial fee structure is as follows:\n\n| Instrument | Maker | Taker |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Perp | 1bp | 6bp |\n| Option | 3bp | 4bp |\n\nAll fees charged by Lyra Exchange are owned by the Lyra DAO. Fees may be used to cover operational expenses such as paying gas costs on behalf of users.\n\n## Launch Mainnet\n\nThe fourth step of launching is to enable mainnet trading. Once all three components are deployed, mainnet trading will be enabled. Once the system is deemed to be operating correctly, the incentive program will begin (details proposed separately). The start date may be delayed if there are technical or liquidity issues.\n\n## Transfer Ownership to Governance\n\nThe final step of launching V2 is to transfer ownership of the V2 contracts from the DAO multisig to the onchain governance system. Lyra has a fully autonomous on-chain governance system that is managed by LYRA holders. It will enable direct token holder governance of V2, including the chain, protocol and exchange. After the system is operating smoothly, ownership will transfer to the on-chain governance system.\n\n### Launching New Markets\n\nIn the period before ownership is transferred to onchain governance, the DAO can launch markets and collateral assets with sufficient liquidity and are deemed low risk. Once ownership has been transferred any new market will need to go through the full governance process.\n\n##  Deprecate Newport\n\nOnce V2 is live, the Newport release will be migrated to v1.lyra.finance. Users will be able to withdraw their LP positions and close positions at this interface up until December 20 2023. After this date, users will need to interact directly with contracts to withdraw assets and close positions. The last expiry available on the Newport contracts will be on January 26 2024.\n\n#  Rationale\n\nThe rationale has been addressed throughout the proposal.\n\n# Test Cases\n\nTest cases are included with each source code repository.\n\n# Configurable Parameters\n\nN/A",

      "title": "LYRA Economics V2: Governance, Adoption and Sustainability",
      "content": "Governance\n\nDecentralised ownership and control of V2\n\n\nLYRA remains first and foremost a governance token, allowing its holders to govern the DAO. With the launch of V2, LYRA will also facilitate governance of the Lyra Chain and the V2 protocol. Governance will occur via the fully autonomous on-chain system 1 that was established in early 2023, enabling token holders to directly control all aspects of the DAO.\n\nTo enter the system, users need to stake their LYRA for stkLYRA, which grants them the right to propose and vote on proposals, as well as to delegate these rights. Holders of stkLYRA are responsible for governing protocol parameters and controlling the treasury by approving or rejecting all requests for funding. Proposals follow the LEAP process which is community-led and fully permissionless, culminating with an on-chain vote that is processed without reliance on any third parties.\n\nStakers receive a proportionate share of 10m LYRA per year. Unstaking carries a 14-day cooldown period.\n\nAdoption\n\n150,000,000 LYRA to bootstrap Lyra Chain and the V2 protocol.\n\nEcosystem incentives\nThe LYRA token is a powerful tool to incentivize the adoption of the protocol. Due to prudent spending, the DAO has retained around 35% of the LYRA supply. This proposal recommends distributing 15% (150,000,000) to takers based on the fees they pay while trading on the protocol. This distribution serves two main purposes:\n\nGovernance alignment: To establish a strong connection between early adopters of Lyra v2 and the DAO, aligning incentives between key stakeholders by granting ownership and governance rights in the future of the protocol.\nUser & liquidity acquisition: To attract new traders to Lyra v2 that will generate volume and fees for the protocol.\n150,000,000 LYRA will be distributed over 96 epochs, with each epoch lasting 7 days.\n\nRewards Specification\n\nTakers are allocated a pro-rata percentage of the rewards pool based on fees paid:\n\nThe rewards pool will consist of 150,000,000 LYRA distributed over 24 months\n\nRewards are to be determined at the end of each 7 day epoch\nRewards will be delivered in full as LYRA after the end of each epoch.\nIn the special case of the “launch season”, all rewards will be delivered at the end of epoch 12.\n\nGrowth Experiments\n\nUp to 15% of each epoch’s allocation of LYRA taker rewards can be diverted to bespoke incentive programs for traders. These programs can include but are not limited to trading competitions, referral programs and airdrops. The purpose of this allocation is to give the core contributors who focus on protocol growth and adoption the flexibility to run growth experiments outside the scope of the rigid epoch schedule and pro-rata fee rewards program.\n\nAt the end of each epoch the core contributors will publicly report:\n\n- What experiments were run\n- What experiments are underway\n- How successful experiments were in acquiring traders and volume\n- Reward distributions and addresses for the epoch\n\nLearnings from these experiments will help the DAO determine the most effective way to evolve long-term public rewards programs to increase active traders and organic trading activity.\n\nTo preserve flexibility around timing and duration of experiments so that they can run across multiple epochs:\n\nLYRA allocations from the current epoch can be used in the next epoch provided the program started during the current epoch.\nLYRA allocations from up to the next 12 epochs can be earmarked for programs that need to run across multiple epochs.\nAny LYRA that is not allocated during an epoch is returned to the pro-rata fee rewards pool.\nThe community can vote to adjust or remove the growth experiments allocation for future epochs with a snapshot vote. However, allocations from ongoing experiments that have promised traders rewards for up to the next 12 epochs (for example, a 3 month trading competition) will be respected.\n\nSustainability\n\nFor governing the network, the DAO earns protocol and rollup fees\n\nLYRA holders govern the Lyra Chain and the V2 protocol via the DAO. In order to create a sustainable ecosystem, the DAO earns fees from both the V2 protocol and Lyra Chain.\n\nProtocol fees\n\nAs described in the V2 proposal, the protocol and the DAO-controlled security module architecture play a critical, risk-bearing role in the functioning of the network:\n\n- Risk management: the risk managers determine their users’ margin requirements on-chain, thereby reducing counterparty risk.\n- Liquidity backstop: The autonomous, DAO-governed security module is used to fund insolvencies and facilitates the process of socialized losses should this fail.\n- Liquidations: the managers are responsible for liquidating accounts with insufficient margin, thereby reducing the risk of the system.\n- Settlement: the protocol conducts the settlement of all trades on the platform.\n\nProtocol fees are charged in accordance with extra risk generated by actors using the protocol, they are outlined below:\n\nExchange Fees: Trades on Lyra exchange incur a fee based on whether the trader is a maker or taker and the instrument they are trading. The initial fee schedule for Lyra Exchange is listed below:\n\nInstrument\tMaker\tTaker\nPerp\t1bp\t6bp\nOption\t3bp\t4bp\n\nLiquidation fees: Accounts that are flagged for liquidation are charged a progressive fee of up to 10% based on the mark-to-market value of the account in accordance with the increased risk backstopped by the security module.\n\nSay Alice has a portfolio with a mark-to-market value of $100,000. When she is liquidated, she will be charged a liquidation fee, proportional to $10,000 (10% of $100,000). This fee scales with how far beneath her maintenance margin she is. I.e. if she is just beneath her maintenance margin, the fee will be, say, $50. If she is very far beneath her margin requirement (and near insolvency) then the fee will be $10000.\n\nSpread on interest: In the protocol, there is a native lending market on balances of USDC. Users may enter into a negative cash (credit) balance by borrowing against long positions but in return pay interest to all accounts with a positive (debit) USDC balance. The protocol charges a 20% spread on this interest since borrowing and lending incur risks to the security module.\n\nSay Alice and Bob have negative cash balances and over a 24-hour period they accrue $10,000 in interest. Charlie and David have positive cash balances and so they receive this interest. However, the security module first takes 20% of $10,000 and so $8,000 is split between Charlie, David and the Security Module (proportional to their cash balances).\n\nRollup fees\n\nAs with any rollup, Lyra Chain has an economic structure that fundamentally involves offering blockspace on Layer 2 (L2) and purchasing it on Layer 1 (L1). The structure is as follows:\n\nUsers - send transactions on the L2 and pay fees to the rollup operator.\nLyra Chain - batches transactions and submits them to L1.\nL1 - the underlying blockchain where transaction data is published.\n\nOn-chain gas flows:\n\nL1 Gas Cost = Gas spent posting the rollup data on L1.\nL2 Gas Received = Gas received by Lyra Chain from users on L2.\nExcess gas = L2 gas received - L1 gas cost\n\nSequencer profit split:\n\n70% to the Lyra DAO (for governing the rollup)\n15% to Conduit (for operating the off-chain infrastructure)\n15% to Optimism Foundation (for designing and building the OP stack)\n\nRisk Assessors & the Lyra Foundation\nAs defined in the V2 whitepaper, Risk Assessors (RAs) enable onchain portfolio margin without compromising the trustlessness of the protocol. At launch, the Lyra Exchange will be the initial Risk Assessor but this role can be performed by any entity who gains approval from the DAO.\n\nIn order to be approved, a RA must drive value to the protocol in proportion to their usage and the additional risks borne by the DAO. Risk assessors must also maintain and report a balance of stkLYRA. While a straight matching fee share would be ideal, this requirement is impossible to verify since an entity can charge fees off-chain. This necessitates a volume-based fee-share agreement.\n\nWe outline basic requirements and rights of a RA to inform future proposals:\n\nRA Requirements\n- Governance approval from the stkLYRA holders\n- Report monthly volume settled to the Lyra protocol\n- Report and adhere to LYRA Staking requirements\n- Deliver volume-based fees to the Lyra security module in a timely manner\n- Reserve VIP lowest fee tiers in any program for accounts holding stkLYRA\n- Perform insolvency checks prior to submitting orders - this is verifiable if a matcher is sending numerous failed transactions to the protocol that do not pass the insolvency check\n\nRA Rights\n-Charge fees for matching, data, and exchange connectivity\n- Implement their own proprietary APIs and order-matching algorithms\n- Bypass the protocol OI fee\n- Bypass non-essential risk checks except mark-to-market (insolvency)\n- Require individual subaccounts to post stkLYRA to help meet exchange staking requirements\n- Receive discounts on Lyra DAO fee shares in accordance with their VIP staking status and volume\n\nLyra DAO Rights\n- Approve Risk Assessors via governance\n- Revoke approval of a Risk Assessor via governance\n- Require a Risk Assessor to hold and verify a stkLYRA balance that scales with volume in order to maintain their status\n- RA partnerships will be approved by the Lyra DAO and may be coordinated with the Foundation to negotiate more specific terms.\n\n\n",

      "title": "[LRFC] Launch Lyra V2",
      "content": "# Simple Summary\n\nDeploy and launch Lyra V2.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines the sequence needed to launch Lyra V2. It will be deployed by the Lyra Foundation in collaboration with its service providers. Once the system is operating reliably, ownership of the contracts will be transferred to Lyra DAO’s on-chain governance system.\n\nThe sequence is as follows:\n\n1. If approved on snapshot:\n    1. Deploy Lyra Chain, Protocol and Exchange\n    2. Foundation funds security module on behalf of the DAO\n    3. V2 mainnet launches\n    4. V2 incentives start\n2. If approved onchain (<3 months post-launch)\n    1. Ownership transferred to DAO\n    2. Foundation reimbursed for security module funding\n\n# Motivation\n\nThis proposal is a follow-up to the introduction of [Lyra V2](https://forums.lyra.finance/t/lrfc-introduce-lyra-v2-and-establish-lyra-foundation/108). The remaining v2 work has been completed, and thus, it is time to seek community approval to launch. \n\n# Specification\n\nBefore describing the steps to launch, we begin by visualising the V2 architecture at a high level. This helps the reader understand the relationship between the core software components (chain, protocol, exchange), the entities that work on behalf of the DAO (governance, foundation, service providers), the different types of users that interact with the system and the flow of value back to the DAO.\n\n \n![v2-architecture_11zon.jpg](ipfs://bafkreiao3vanqwepgylvpafo3zykcwy5sj5hyr5rjv7t6u64yitquw73ei)\n    \n\n**V2 Components - Core software**\n\n1. Lyra Chain - Ethereum rollup built with the OP Stack.\n2. Lyra Protocol - Generalised margin and risk protocol.\n3. Lyra Exchange - Self-custodial exchange.\n\n**Entities - Work on behalf of the DAO**\n\n1. Lyra Foundation - Not-for-profit legal entity that acts on behalf of the Lyra DAO.\n2. Service Providers - Assist the foundation with operating components of V2.\n\n**Users - Interact with Lyra V2**\n\n1. Lyra Stakers - coordinate Lyra governance\n2. UI Traders - access Lyra Exchange via GUI\n3. API Traders - access Lyra Exchange via API\n4. Integrators - build on Lyra Protocol \n5. Protocol builders - launch entirely new protocols on Lyra Chain\n6. Ethereum Stakers - provide the economic security to secure Lyra Governance\n\n## Deploy Lyra Chain\n\nThe first step in launching V2 is to deploy Lyra Chain.\n\n**Summary**\n\nLyra chain is an Ethereum roll-up built using the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/). It is a smart contract platform that provides a high-performance foundation for the V2 protocol whilst inheriting the security of Ethereum. To learn more about Lyra Chain, read the [introductory v2 proposal](https://forums.lyra.finance/t/lrfc-introduce-lyra-v2-and-establish-lyra-foundation/108/11) or [this blog post](https://mirror.xyz/lyra.eth/TWH07KhC61fLdMEfZ_TOkBpZPA6HFFqg0F9zvSL5R2Y).\n\n### Accessing Lyra Chain\n\nUsers can choose between the standard Optimism bridge or a fast bridge developed by Socket. Documentation for the Socket bridge can be viewed [here](https://github.com/SocketDotTech/socket-plugs/blob/main/contracts/superbridge/README.md) and [here](https://developer.socket.tech/Learn/protocol-design/).\n\n### Lyra Chain Configuration\n\n| Name | Value | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| RPC URL | rpc.lyra.finance | Remote Procedure Call for interacting with Lyra Chain |\n| Epxlorer URL | explorer.lyra.finance | Graphical interface for transactions and blocks |\n| Chain ID | 957 | Unique identifier for Lyra Chain |\n\n## Deploy Lyra Protocol\n\nThe second step in launching V2 is to deploy the V2 Protocol to Lyra Chain.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe Lyra Protocol is a series of smart contracts that collectively create a generalised risk engine, capable of portfolio margin. To learn more about the protocol, please review the v2 [whitepaper](https://www.lyra.finance/files/v2-whitepaper.pdf).\n\n### V2 Source Code\n\n| Name | Description | Link |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| V2-core | The core version 2 protocol | https://github.com/lyra-finance/v2-core |\n| V2-matching | Contracts that enable sequential matching | https://github.com/lyra-finance/v2-matching |\n| lyra-utils | Commonly used libraries in the Lyra Protocol | https://github.com/lyra-finance/lyra-utils |\n\n### Audit\n\nThe protocol was audited by Sigma Prime and the report is available here: https://github.com/sigp/public-audits/blob/master/lyra-finance/review.pdf\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe initial configuration of parameters is available here: [https://lyra-finance.notion.site/Lyra-V2-Parameters-2d02b3c941e64292b0df6b925aea31b7](https://www.notion.so/Lyra-V2-Parameters-2d02b3c941e64292b0df6b925aea31b7?pvs=21)\n\n## Deploy Lyra Exchange\n\nThe third step in launching V2 is to deploy the Exchange.\n\n**Summary**\n\nLyra Exchange is a self-custodial exchange hosted by the Lyra Foundation and built with Lyra DAO’s open-source matching service. It has been built from the ground up to be competitive with the world’s largest crypto derivatives exchanges (not just DEXs).\n\n### Accessing Lyra Exchange\n\nThere are two ways to access Lyra Exchange, via the client and directly via the API.\n\n1. Client - Recommended for the majority of users who prefer to trade via a graphical user interface.\n2. API - Recommended for advanced and professional traders who prefer to trade programmatically. Documentation is available [here](https://v2-docs.lyra.finance/reference/overview).\n\n### Exchange Fee Structure\n\nLyra Exchange is the initial “Risk Assessor”, which means it can apply for an alternative fee structure. This model is intended to allow exchanges building on Lyra Protocol the ability to offer pricing that is in line with popular centralised and decentralised competitors. The initial fee structure is as follows:\n\n| Instrument | Maker | Taker |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Perp | 1bp | 6bp |\n| Option | 3bp | 4bp |\n\nAll fees charged by Lyra Exchange are owned by the Lyra DAO. Fees may be used to cover operational expenses such as paying gas costs on behalf of users.\n\n## Launch Mainnet\n\nThe fourth step of launching is to enable mainnet trading. Once all three components are deployed, mainnet trading will be enabled. Once the system is deemed to be operating correctly, the foundation will begin the incentive program (details proposed separately). The foundation may choose to delay the start of incentives if there are technical or liquidity issues.\n\n## Transfer Ownership to DAO\n\nThe final step of launching V2 is to transfer ownership of the V2 contracts to the DAO. Lyra has a fully autonomous on-chain governance system that is managed by LYRA holders. It will enable direct token holder governance of V2, including the chain, protocol and exchange. After the system is operating smoothly, Lyra Foundation will transfer ownership of the V2 protocol to the on-chain governance system.\n\n##  Deprecate Newport\n\nOnce V2 is live, the Newport release will be migrated to v1.lyra.finance. Users will be able to withdraw their LP positions and close positions at this interface up until December 20 2023. After this date, users will need to interact directly with contracts to withdraw assets and close positions. The last expiry available on the Newport contracts will be on January 26 2024.\n\n#  Rationale\n\nThe rationale has been addressed throughout the proposal.\n\n# Test Cases\n\nTest cases are included with each source code repository.\n\n# Configurable Parameters\n\nN/A",

      "title": "[LRFC] LYRA Economics V2: Governance, Adoption and Sustainability",
      "content": "# Simple Summary\n\nUpgrade the utility and economics of LYRA to prepare for V2.\n\n# Abstract\n\nWe outline a proposal to upgrade the utility and economics of the LYRA token. This proposal has three goals:\n\n1. Decentralize **governance** and ownership of Lyra Chain and the v2 protocol\n2. Promote the **adoption** of the protocol by key stakeholders\n3. Provide a path to **sustainability** for the DAO\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe LYRA token was launched in late [2021](https://leaps.lyra.finance/leaps/leap-8/) with a community-led [distribution](https://leaps.lyra.finance/leaps/leap-7/) that decentralised ownership of the then-nascent project. In the two years since, the Lyra DAO has grown to include almost 10,000 token holders, who use the LYRA token to collectively govern the protocol and treasury.\n\nWe now approach the launch of Lyra V2, which will grow the onchain derivatives market 100x by building a new type of exchange. By redefining what’s possible onchain, Lyra V2 will become foundational infrastructure as DeFi scales to meet the demands of the broader financial system. To maximise the chance of success, we need to upgrade the economics and utility of the LYRA token to enable decentralisation and adoption of V2 and sustainability of the DAO.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Governance\n\n> Decentralised ownership and control of V2\n\nLYRA remains first and foremost a governance token, allowing its holders to govern the DAO. With the launch of V2, LYRA will also facilitate governance of the Lyra Chain and the V2 protocol. Governance will occur via the fully autonomous on-chain [system](https://leaps.lyra.finance/leaps/leap-51/) that was established in early 2023, enabling token holders to directly control all aspects of the DAO.\n\nTo enter the system, users need to stake their LYRA for stkLYRA, which grants them the right to propose and vote on proposals, as well as to delegate these rights. Holders of stkLYRA are responsible for governing protocol parameters and controlling the treasury by approving or rejecting all requests for funding. Proposals follow the LEAP process which is community-led and fully permissionless, culminating with an on-chain vote that is processed without reliance on any third parties.\n\nStakers receive a proportionate share of 10m LYRA per year. Unstaking carries a 14-day cooldown period.\n\n## Adoption\n\n> 150,000,000 LYRA over 24 months to bootstrap Lyra Chain and the V2 protocol.\n \n![rewards-final.png](ipfs://bafkreievjdgiw6o2jldnzs6gfeylvfi6r5q7ofskw7d5krrwqdyst6ibny)\n  \n### Ecosystem incentives\n\nThe LYRA token is a powerful tool to incentivize the adoption of the protocol. Due to prudent spending, the DAO has retained around 35% of the LYRA supply. This proposal recommends distributing 15% (150,000,000) to users based on the fees they pay while trading on the protocol. This distribution serves two main purposes:\n\n- **Governance alignment:** To establish a strong connection between early adopters of Lyra v2 and the DAO, aligning incentives between key stakeholders by granting ownership and governance rights in the future of the protocol.\n- **User & liquidity acquisition:** To attract new traders to Lyra v2 that will generate volume and fees for the protocol.\n\n150,000,000 LYRA will be distributed over 24 epochs, with each epoch lasting 28 days.\n ### Rewards Specification\n\nUsers are allocated a pro-rata percentage of the rewards pool based on fees paid:\n \n![formula-final.png](ipfs://bafkreibigpqu2rpwau7naasairrcb6lfpjojex6jcvhqygzpz3uv3cprcm)\n   \nThe rewards pool will consist of 150,000,000 LYRA distributed over 24 months\n\n- Rewards are to be determined at the end of each 28-day epoch\n- Rewards will vest as stkLYRA with a 1-month cliff and then a 3-month linear schedule.\n\nThere will be 24 epochs. During the initial two epochs, rewards will be kept relatively low to ensure the effective operation of the new system. Rewards will increase over epochs 3-6, before flattening. From Epoch 7, the rewards will decrease until Epoch 24.\n\n## Sustainability\n\n> For governing the network, the DAO earns protocol and rollup fees\n \n![fees-final.png](ipfs://bafkreichg5ich76zvqsp3bek4pmqimkutzgs7ujao2geoodq23yl6hkmlu)\n\nLYRA holders govern the Lyra Chain and the V2 protocol via the DAO. In order to create a sustainable ecosystem, the DAO earns fees from both the V2 protocol and Lyra Chain.\n\n### Protocol fees\n\nAs described in the V2 proposal, the protocol and the DAO-controlled security module architecture play a critical, risk-bearing role in the functioning of the network:\n\n**Risk management**: the risk managers determine their users’ margin requirements on-chain, thereby reducing counterparty risk.\n**Liquidity backstop**: The autonomous, DAO-governed security module is used to fund insolvencies and facilitates the process of socialized losses should this fail.\n**Liquidations**: the managers are responsible for liquidating accounts with insufficient margin, thereby reducing the risk of the system.\n**Settlement**: the protocol conducts the settlement of all trades on the platform.\n\nProtocol fees are charged in accordance with extra risk generated by actors using the protocol, they are outlined below:\n\n**Exchange Fees**: Trades on Lyra exchange incur a fee based on whether the trader is a maker or taker and the instrument they are trading. The initial fee schedule for Lyra Exchange is listed below:\n\n| Instrument | Maker | Taker |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Perp | 1bp | 6bp |\n| Option | 3bp | 4bp |\n\n**Liquidation fees**: Accounts that are flagged for liquidation are charged a progressive fee of up to 10% based on the mark-to-market value of the account in accordance with the increased risk backstopped by the security module.\n\nSay Alice has a portfolio with a mark-to-market value of $100,000. When she is liquidated, she will be charged a liquidation fee, proportional to $10,000 (10% of $100,000). This fee scales with how far beneath her maintenance margin she is. I.e. if she is just beneath her maintenance margin, the fee will be, say, $50. If she is very far beneath her margin requirement (and near insolvency) then the fee will be $10000.\n\n**Spread on interest**: In the protocol, there is a native lending market on balances of USDC. Users may enter into a negative cash (credit) balance by borrowing against long positions but in return pay interest to all accounts with a positive (debit) USDC balance. The protocol charges a 20% spread on this interest since borrowing and lending incur risks to the security module.\n\nSay Alice and Bob have negative cash balances and over a 24-hour period they accrue $10,000 in interest. Charlie and David have positive cash balances and so they receive this interest. However, the security module first takes 20% of $10,000 and so $8,000 is split between Charlie, David and the Security Module (proportional to their cash balances).\n\n### Rollup fees\n \n![rollup-final.png](ipfs://bafkreicu22gvu5vugw2xwjcdjixwar2tjxwravuqqmottlj5e6niqqrinu)\n\nAs with any rollup, Lyra Chain has an economic structure that fundamentally involves offering blockspace on Layer 2 (L2) and purchasing it on Layer 1 (L1). The structure is as follows:\n\n- Users - send transactions on the L2 and pay fees to the rollup operator.\n- Lyra Chain - batches transactions and submits them to L1.\n- L1 - the underlying blockchain where transaction data is published.\n\nOn-chain gas flows:\n\n- L1 Gas Cost = Gas spent posting the rollup data on L1.\n- L2 Gas Received = Gas received by Lyra Chain from users on L2.\n- Excess gas = L2 gas received - L1 gas cost\n\nSequencer profit split:\n\n- 70% to the Lyra DAO (for governing the rollup)\n- 15% to Conduit (for operating the off-chain infrastructure)\n- 15% to Optimism Foundation (for designing and building the OP stack)\n\n### Risk Assessors & the Lyra Foundation\n\nAs defined in the V2 whitepaper, Risk Assessors (RAs) enable onchain portfolio margin without compromising the trustlessness of the protocol. At launch, the Lyra Foundation will be the initial Risk Assessor but this role can be performed by any entity who gains approval from the DAO.\n\nIn order to be approved, a RA must drive value to the protocol in proportion to their usage and the additional risks borne by the DAO. Risk assessors must also maintain and report a balance of stkLYRA. While a straight matching fee share would be ideal, this requirement is impossible to verify since an entity can charge fees off-chain. This necessitates a volume-based fee-share agreement.\n\nWe outline basic requirements and rights of a RA to inform future proposals:\n\n**RA Requirements** \n\n- Governance approval from the stkLYRA holders\n- Report monthly volume settled to the Lyra protocol\n- Report and adhere to LYRA Staking requirements\n- Deliver volume-based fees to the Lyra security module in a timely manner\n- Reserve VIP lowest fee tiers in any program for accounts holding stkLYRA\n- Perform insolvency checks prior to submitting orders - this is verifiable if a matcher is sending numerous failed transactions to the protocol that do not pass the insolvency check\n\n**RA Rights**\n\n- Charge fees for matching, data, and exchange connectivity\n- Implement their own proprietary APIs and order-matching algorithms\n- Bypass the protocol OI fee\n- Bypass non-essential risk checks except mark-to-market (insolvency)\n- Require individual subaccounts to post stkLYRA to help meet exchange staking requirements\n- Receive discounts on Lyra DAO fee shares in accordance with their VIP staking status and volume\n\n**Lyra DAO Rights**\n\n- Approve Risk Assessors via governance\n- Revoke approval of a Risk Assessor via governance\n- Require a Risk Assessor to hold and verify a stkLYRA balance that scales with volume in order to maintain their status\n\nRA partnerships will be approved by the Lyra DAO and may be coordinated with the Foundation to negotiate more specific terms.\n\n# Rationale\n**Incentive Structure** \n\nThe proposed incentives aim to attract new participants such as traders, liquidity providers, and integrators to the V2 protocol and chain. To motivate these stakeholders to take on new platform risk and technical integration costs, the incentives must be substantial and predictable over an extended period. The emission of 150,000,000 tokens over two years strikes a balance between preserving DAO tokens and offering a strong incentive for potential users to join the chain and protocol.\n\nMoreover, productive users of the protocol, i.e., those who generate fees captured by the network via the insurance fund, receive incentives. These incentives are emitted as vested stkLYRA in proportion to protocol fees incurred, ensuring that protocol users are aligned with the Lyra DAO over the long term.\n\n**Security Module Funding**\n\nA well-funded insurance fund is crucial to a derivatives margin and settlement layer. This fund serves as the ultimate liquidator, assuming insolvent positions that could occur due to turbulent market conditions or periods of lower liquidity in the protocol. The assurance provided by a well-funded insurance fund creates a virtuous cycle. Higher confidence in the fund encourages greater trader and integrator confidence and volumes, which in turn further strengthens the insurance fund.\n\nWithin this framework, the role of LYRA holders is explicit: as the owners of the insurance fund and the protocol's governors, they are motivated to establish responsible risk parameters. These parameters should balance protocol performance with sound risk management. Over time, this structure allows the LYRA token's role to evolve into directing insurance fund (and eventually AMM) liquidity around the LYRA chain, supporting productive, risk-bearing modules in the protocol.\n\n**Distribution**\n\nThe proposed incentive structure results in LYRA accumulation for the protocol's power users. Over time, the token might be used to unlock the highest level of rewards and the lowest fee tiers on interfaces integrated with LYRA for stakers. By rewarding power users with tokens over a two-year period, we align their interests and ensure that they continue to significantly influence the protocol's strategic direction in the long run.\n\n# Test Cases\n\nN/A\n\n# Configurable Values\n\nEmissions\n- Lyra Staking Rate = 10,000,000 per year\n- Lyra Incentives = 150,000,000 over 2 years\n\nProtocol / Exchange Fees\n- Perp Maker = 1bp\n- Perp Taker = 6bp\n- Option Maker = 3bp\n- Option Taker = 4bp\n- Liquidation Fee = 10%\n- Interest SM Fee = 20%\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0 ](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": "Lyra & Velodrome - Automate veVELO management with Relay",
      "content": "Simple Summary\nLyra has accumulated over $11K in unclaimed voting rewards and 650K unclaimed veVELO rebases on Velodrome, resulting in Lyra missing out on faster growth for its veVELO position and increased ability to attract liquidity for the LYRA/USDC pool. Velodrome has recently deployed Relay, an automated veVELO managing solution that would allow Lyra to automatically claim rewards weekly and effortlessly grow Lyra’s votepower. This proposal seeks approval to deposit Lyra’s veVELO position into a personalized Relay strategy that will vote for LYRA/USDC and compound the resulting rewards.\n\nAbstract\nOn Velodrome, VELO emissions are directed to pools based on the amount of votes they receive and this attracts LPs to provide liquidity. Because voters receive 100% of the fees and incentives on Velodrome, Lyra is using its gifted veVELO NFT to not only sustain about 1.2M worth of TVL for free but simultaneously earn swap fees every week.\n\nLike many other projects, however, Lyra is not regularly claiming its weekly rewards (and rebases) from its veVELO position. This is understandable given how time-consuming it can be for multisig signers to execute transactions related to locking VELO, voting and claiming rewards each week—not to mention time-sensitive swaps!\n\nVelodrome Relay solves this problem, streamlining the user experience by automating veVELO management. With Relay, Lyra can create a personalized voting strategy, select how rewards will be managed, and let the Relay vaults do all the work.\n\nRewards\nVelodrome Relay can automatically compound rewards into veVELO. The screenshot in comment section below shows the rewards the Lyra’s veVELO NFT has accumulated over the past few months i.e. more than $11K worth of rewards.\n\nRebases\nVelodrome Relay will also automatically claim rebases to further maximise votepower. As of now, Lyra has an unclaimed 650K veVELO rebase available, plus a potential increase in votepower by extending the veVELO lock time. With Relay, Lyra’s veVELO will gain an 11% boost in votepower (8.8M to 9.8M votes) with no user action. Screenshot also linked in comment section below.\n\nMore details on Relay can be found in our article here 3.\n\nMotivation\nVelodrome Relay automates the entire process of weekly claiming of rewards and compounding into more veVELO. Not only will this save Lyra’s multisig signers time to execute these transactions but rewards and rebases will also be automatically compounded into its veNFT to increase the votes its LYRA/USDC pool gets, which means more emissions and deeper liquidity, as well as growing Lyra’s share of fee rewards received every week.\n\nVelodrome Relay is particularly valuable for Lyra since its multisig is not regularly claiming the weekly rewards and rebases from its veVELO position as highlighted above. Relay will also keep Lyra’s votes on the LYRA/USDC pool.\n\nSpecification\nVelodrome team will create a Relay instance for the Lyra team and transfer the admin role to the Lyra treasury on Optimism: 0xd4c00fe7657791c2a43025de483f05e49a5f76a6\nLyra multisig will deposit its veVELO NFT into the newly created Strategy\nVelodrome team will provide a transaction for the Lyra multisig to upload in order to allocate 100% of votes to the LYRA/USDC pool\nDone! Relay will now automate weekly reward and rebase claims and compound into more veVELO\nRationale\nLyra’s veVELO voting has always gone towards its one and only pool on Velodrome, LYRA/USDC so this should be upheld by Relay.\n\nTest Cases\nN/A\n\nCopyright Waiver\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0 .",

      "title": "Newport Rewards Reduction and Terminal Rate",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nTo prepare for the launch of Lyra v2, it is necessary to start gradually reducing the incentives programs for the current version of the protocol, Newport. Additionally, we should establish a final rate of incentives until v2 is fully operational.\n\n## Abstract\n\nProposing an adjustment of the current incentive programs which apply to the Lyra Newport deployments on both Arbitrum and Optimism.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe launch of Lyra v2 is expected in Q4 2023. v2 will provide a significant increase in capital efficiency and enhance the trading experience for users. To prepare for its launch, we should start unwinding incentive programs for Newport and shift our incentives and focus towards v2.\n\n## Specification\n\nThe current incentive schemes for Newport are divided between the Optimism and Arbitrum deployments as follows:\n\n**Arbitrum Rewards (per 2 week epoch)**\n\n|Category|Trading|WETH Vault|Total|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|LYRA|26,400|255,000|281,400|\n\n**Optimism Rewards (per 2 week epoch)**\n\n|Category|Trading|WETH Vault|WBTC Vault|OP Vault|ARB Vault|XRP Vault|LINK Vault|Total|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|OP|7,500|14,600|2,270|603|603|603|603|26,782|\n\nWe propose a reduction in rates according the below schedules:\n\n**Optimism**\n\n|Epoch|OP-TRADING|OP-WETH Vault|OP-WBTC Vault|OP-OP Vault|OP-ARB Vault|OP-XRP Vault|OP-LINK Vault|Total OP|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Nov8 - Nov21|4,500|8,800|1,400|360|360|360|360|16,140|\n|Nov22 - Dec5|3,500|7,000|1,100|288|288|288|288|12,752|\n|Dec6 - Dec19|2,800|5,300|900|250|250|250|250|10,000|\n|Dec20 - Jan2|2,800|5,300|900|250|250|250|250|10,000|\n\n**Arbitrum**\n\n|Epoch|LYRA-TRADING|LYRA-WETH Vault|Total LYRA|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Nov8 - Nov21|20,000|150,000|170,000|\n|Nov22 - Dec5|15,000|115,000|130,000|\n|Dec6 - Dec19|15,000|85,000|100,000|\n|Dec20 - Jan2|15,000|85,000|100,000|\n\n## Rationale\n\nThe proposed reduction in rewards gives LPs and users the requisite notice for a graceful migration. The proposed schedule offers a gradual reduction in incentives so as to not create a disconnect in the trading experience at any particular point in time. With the launch of v2 expected to come before the end of Q4, this schedule also provides a buffer to ensure that the protocol has a live product throughout Q4, during the transition.\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "title": "Introduce Lyra V2 and Establish Lyra Foundation",
      "content": "3.1 Lyra Chain\n\nLyra Chain is an Ethereum rollup built using the OP stack 3 and is the home of the Lyra Protocol. It is a permissionless smart contract platform that boosts performance whilst inheriting Ethereum’s security. In this section, we describe the performance, usability and security benefits of Lyra Chain.\n\n3.1.1 Performance\n\nLyra Chain will offer Lyra’s users a dedicated execution environment for the protocol, improving several facets of performance relative to the experience on Optimism and Arbitrum. Users can expect the following benefits:\n1. Faster confirmations (reduced latency) due to having a dedicated sequencer.\n2. Cheaper transactions and a clear path to an order of magnitude reduction with EIP-4844 which will be adopted by Lyra Chain.\n3. Less congestion due to not having to compete with other protocols and their users.\n\n3.1.2 Usability\n\nLyra Chain is being built to provide one of the best user experiences of any on-chain project:\n1. It will include a fast bridge that enables users to deposit and withdraw from Ethereum and rollups including Optimism, Arbitrum and others.\n2. Users of Lyra Chain won’t have to understand or manage gas. Meta transactions enable users to trade without directly paying gas fees, enabled by third-party relayers.\n3. Lyra Chain will proactively integrate native account abstraction features to build a best in class transaction experience.\n\n3.1.3 Security\n\nLike any rollup, Lyra Chain inherits the security of Ethereum by moving computation off-chain to a centralized sequencer while ensuring sufficient data is available to reconstruct valid state in the event of maliciousness or downtime. In its final state, Lyra chain will be able to provide the following guarantees:\n1. Liveness - Providing a trustless escape hatch that allows users to withdraw assets in case of sequencer downtime.\n2. Censorship Resistance - The ability to transact via Ethereum if the sequencer is actively censoring the user.\n3. Dispute Resolution - Creating a fraud-proof to challenge an invalid state root in the case of a malicious sequencer.\n\nIt is important to note that these security features are still under active development.\n\n3.2 Lyra Protocol\n\nThe Lyra Protocol is a series of smart contracts deployed on Lyra Chain. There are three main components to the Protocol: subaccounts, managers and assets. The Protocol is modular by design, allowing for swift iteration, meaning many of these layers will be further enhanced over time. We now outline the protocol at a high level (for further detail, see the whitepaper).\n\n3.2.1 Subaccounts\n\nSubaccounts are the base unit of the Protocol. All users will be able to permissionlessly mint a subaccount entity which houses all of their supported assets. Subaccounts are ERC-721 compliant NFTs and have two main functionalities:\n1. Ensure only authorized parties are able to change the subaccount’s balances.\n2. Inform all relevant parties about any trade involving the subaccount.\n\nThis was made possible through the use of hooks; external function calls to relevant contracts that occur during and after any asset transfer. There are two such hooks:\n1. the asset hook (invokes the asset to validate transfers) and\n2. the manager hook (which calls the manager to authenticate the final state of the subaccount)\n\n3.2.2 Assets\n\nAn asset contract is responsible for determining the results of a transfer, trade, deposit, withdrawal or settlement. To support deposits and withdrawals, as well as interest accrual, an asset has the privilege to update its own balances in any subaccount.\n\nAt launch, there will be four types of assets available:\n1. cashAsset: Each manager supports one cashAsset. This is referred to as the quote asset.\n2. option: European options on a given underlying asset.\n3. perp: Perpetual futures on a given underlying.\n4. wrappedERC20: Wrapped ERC20 tokens like wBTC.\n\nBalances for wrapped assets can only be credits (longs) whereas all other assets can be credits or debits (longs or shorts).\n\nAssets and managers are linked; certain assets will only be supported by specific managers and vice versa. This relationship is maintained via the aforementioned hooks.\n\nEach risk manager supports a single quote asset. As with options and perpetuals, users can hold credit or debt balances of the quote asset. Unlike these other assets, users with debit balances will have to pay interest on this sum. This interest is then paid out to all other users with credit balances. Thus, the quote asset facilitates a native lending market over its supported managers.\n\nAt launch, USDC will be the only supported quote asset.\n\n3.2.3 Managers\n\nManagers are smart contracts that govern the margin requirements of subscribed subaccounts. At launch, there will be two managers available: the standard risk manager (SRM) and portfolio margin risk manager (PMRM). When creating a subaccount, the user must subscribe to one of these risk managers.\n\nManagers fulfil the following functions:\n1. Setting Margin Rules: Managers set the margin requirements of all supported subaccounts. To avoid being subject to liquidation, users must satisfy their maintenance margin mandate. To open a new position, the user must fulfil their (stricter) initial margin requirements.\n2. Liquidations: Managers define the conditions for and enforce liquidations.\n3. Settlement: The managers are responsible for settling all trades.\n\n3.2.4 Standard Risk Manager\n\nThis supports USDC, various base assets (say, wBTC), options and perpetuals and has the following key features:\n- Cross Margin: traders use all quote and base balances as collateral for all open positions in a subaccount. Isolated margin is obtained by opening a separate subaccount.\n- Multi-asset collateral: traders will be able to use various base asset to collateralize their perpetuals and options. For instance, a user will be able to collateralize a short BTC perpetual with ETH.\n- Capital Efficient Spreads: Single short options will the require mark-to-market value of the option and a percentage of the spot as margin. However, the SRM is able to cap the margin requirement of spreads to their maximum loss. This means, for example, that a long $1500/$1800 call spread will require precisely $0 of collateral (and the short spread will be capped at $300).\n- Leveraged Perpetuals: Perpetuals can be traded using the SRM with high capital efficiency.\n- Borrowing: If enabled, users can borrow the quote asset against their wrapped ERC20 base assets\n\n3.2.5 Portfolio Margin Risk Manager\n\nThis also supports USDC, a single denominated base asset and corresponding options and perpetuals. Consequently, if a user wishes to use portfolio margin to trade ETH options and BTC options, then two PMRM subaccounts will be required.\n\nMargin requirements are set using portfolio margin, where the entire portfolio is holistically evaluated at many spot and volatility shock scenarios. The scenario which results in the greatest loss is used, along with extra contingency margin, to set the margin requirements.\n\nNote that both managers use the Black76 pricing model to mark options. Options settle to a weighted combination of the twap of spot and forward price.\n\nFinally, we note that due to the large number of Black76 function calls, portfolio margin computations are very gas intensive. To avoid limiting PMRM account sizes, entities approved by governance called trusted risk assessors will be able to bypass all but one risk (namely, the mark to-market, i.e. solvency) check on chain.\n\nWhile it is possible for trusted risk assessors to approve transactions that result in liquidatable (but not insolvent!) positions, such accounts can be immediately liquidated by any willing participant, removing this risk from the system. Further, the trusted risk assessor role can be revoked if the party in question is found to be acting improperly.\n\n3.2.6 Partial Liquidations\n\nUsers who fall beneath their margin requirements are subject to a partial liquidation. Liquidations will be a transparent process and open to all participants, i.e. any user can act as a liquidator and the user being liquidated will be able to monitor their subaccount throughout this process.\n\nThe liquidation mechanism is designed to expeditiously remove risk from the system while at the same time ensuring the most beneficial user experience for traders being liquidated.\n\nAny user can call the function liquidate on any subaccount that is not meeting its maintenance margin requirements. The following then takes place:\n- The user’s entire portfolio is put up for auction by its manager.\n- The auction begins at a small percentage discount to the portfolio’s mark-to-market value and progressively increases to incentivise liquidators to take on the account.\n- Liquidators can agree to take on any percentage of the portfolio at the current discounted auction price. However, this percentage is capped. This bound is a function of the mark-to-market value of the portfolio and its current margin requirements.\n- If the portfolio is not liquidated after a sufficient period of time, an insolvent auction begins. Liquidators are paid by the Security Module to take on the portfolio.\n- If the Security Module runs out of funds to pay off insolvent debt, then the debt is distributed to all traders via a temporary withdrawal fee.\n\n3.2.7 Protocol Fees\n\nEvery risk bearing entity in the architecture can receive fees for doing so. The protocol has three main sources of fee generation, all of which accrue to the protocol owned security module which, when developed, will improve the robustness and resiliency of the protocol:\n\nTrading fees: All transactions that increase the open interest (and therefore risk) of the system will be charged a fee. This fee will be a function of the spot price of the underlying asset and size of the trade.\nLiquidation fees: Users who are liquidated will be charged a small fee that scales with the risk of their account.\nInterest rate spreads: A percentage of all interest paid by negative cash holders is reserved for the security module.\nEntities approved by governance can bypass the trading fee in exchange for, say, a different fee scheme pledge. These approvals can be rescinded if the entity does not meet its requirements.\n\n3.2.8 Parameters and Governance\n\nThere are many parameters that govern the protocol; this is especially true for the managers. These parameters also have to be updated whenever there is a market shift to ensure both capital efficiency and security for traders.\n\nAll parameters in the protocol are controlled by a smart contract that will be owned by Lyra Governance (i.e. the short executor).\n\n3.2.9 Data Feeds\n\nThe managers require oracles to provide the following data in order to accurately assess and control risk:\n\n- Implied volatility (IV): IV for supported tenors will be provided as raw stochastic volatility inspired (SVI) surfaces. These are specified by 5 parameters: (a, b, ρ, m, e).\n- Forwards: The forward price for supported tenors is also supplied. Close to expiration, this becomes a linear combination of the TWAP of the underlying and forward price. The weights, as well as the length of the TWAP, are dependent on the time to settlement.\n- Risk free rates: This is an interest rate curve defined at each supported tenor.\n- Spot: This is the spot (index) price of the underlying assets (ETH, BTC) sourced from multiple outlets.\n- Perpetual Price: This is the market price of the perpetual.\nEach piece of data supplied also has an associated confidence score. Low confidence feeds result in extra initial margin being required for both the SRM and PMRM.\n\n3.3 Lyra Matcher\n\nLyra Matcher will be an open-source order-matching engine that enables high-performance and low-latency matching. It will support all major order types as well as REST and WebSocket APIs for developers. More information on the matcher will be released in a subsequent proposal.\n\n3.4.1 On-chain Governance\n\nIn Lyra V2, on-chain governance will be responsible for various functions across the protocol, chain and treasury:\n\nProtocol\n- Setting Parameters\n- Launching and deprecating markets\n\nChain\n- Accumulating transaction fees from transactions\n- Acting as owner of the sequencer\n- Upgrading code\n\nTreasury\n- Approve/reject funding requests from service providers\n\n3.4.2 Foundation\n\nThis proposal introduces the Lyra Foundation, a not-for-profit legal entity that aims to support the Protocol’s decentralized growth. The Foundation will be able to contract with other entities to provide services for the DAO. The reason for the existence of the foundation is that some service providers cannot deal directly with the DAO via on-chain governance. Some examples are:\n1. Those hosting off-chain infrastructure (rollup sequencer and order book) on behalf of the DAO.\n2. Agreements and incentive structures to foster liquidity on the Lyra Chain.\n3. Providers related to licensing and compliance objectives.\n\nThus the foundation can help Lyra DAO bootstrap the success of V2 much faster. Over time, these functions are expected to be replaced by service providers who can interface with the DAO. At this point, the foundation will be decommissioned. If this proposal is successful, the following assets will be transferred from the DAO to the foundation:\n\n\nAsset\tAmount\nLYRA      100,000,000\nOP\t        750,000\nUSDC\t1,500,000\n\n3.4.2.1 Foundation Key Activities and OKRs\n\nInspired by Uniswap governance 2. We propose a number of initial OKRs for the foundation. Its possible that these OKRs will need to change in the future, and if they do, the Foundation must communicate that to the community.\n\nObjective\tKey Results\n1. Grow protocol activity - Allocate 50% of LYRA funding, and 70% of OP funding to construct long-term aligned liquidity agreements via market makers and protocol integrations on the Lyra Chain. Success will be measured by metrics including (but not limited to): volume, new users, security module fees generated per incentive.\n2. Support continuous protocol development - Allocate 20% of LYRA funding, 30% of OP funding and 100% of USDC funding to contract with relevant service providers (including core contributors) to develop protocol functionality, including (but not limited to): AMM design and development, automated strategy vaults, new collateral onboarding, autonomous hedging vaults, new partnerships. Success to be measured against metrics including (but not limited to): number of new integrations, integration time for developers, integration volumes.\n3. Act as an advocate for the protocol - Take advantage of beneficial opportunities on behalf of the protocol. Offer service providers clarity, accountability, and competitive contract opportunities.\n4. Treasury Diversification - Facilitate diversification of the DAO treasury to ensure it has sufficient capital to fund long term development and growth of the protocol and ecosystem.\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "[LRFC] Introduce Lyra V2 and Establish Lyra Foundation",
      "content": "# Simple Summary\n\nIntroducing Lyra V2 and establishing the Lyra Foundation.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThis proposal outlines “Lyra V2”, a platform that can facilitate the settlement, margining and matching of derivatives. It consists of three main parts:\n\n1. Lyra Chain - an Ethereum rollup built with the OP Stack.\n2. Lyra Protocol - A generalised risk engine.\n3. Lyra Matcher - An open-source order-matcher.\n\nLyra V2 is [governed](https://gov.lyra.finance/dao/overview) by the Lyra DAO which earns trading fees from the Lyra Protocol and transaction fees from the Lyra Chain. Trading fees accrue to an insurance fund to foster the robustness of the protocol and rollup. If approved, this proposal will fund the Lyra Foundation in preparation for launching V2. It will not deploy the Lyra Chain or Protocol.\n\n# Motivation\n\nLyra has captured the majority of the on-chain options market with 70-80% of volume. However, it remains a tiny fraction (1%) of the centralized crypto options market, which in turn is dwarfed by markets in traditional finance. This divide is primarily because on-chain protocols lack the performance of their centralized counterparts, which are cheaper to transact on and offer superior margining systems. This lack of performance rules out many if not all professional users. In addition, myriad usability issues deter users from moving their trading activity on-chain.\n\nThe challenge for the Lyra community is to meet the market where it is, retaining the benefits of a decentralized protocol - self-custody, transparency and composability - whilst improving performance and usability. The rest of this proposal describes Lyra v2, designed from the ground up to grow the on-chain market by 100x.\n\n# Specification\n\n![stack.jpg](ipfs://bafybeidprxyl4l6uh6okw3c3nt7f4np3qa4cvserlykb4kbix66ytubnhi)\n\n## 3.1 Lyra Chain\n\nLyra Chain is an Ethereum rollup built using the [OP stack](https://stack.optimism.io/) and is the home of the Lyra Protocol. It is a permissionless smart contract platform that boosts performance whilst inheriting Ethereum’s security. In this section, we describe the performance, usability and security benefits of Lyra Chain.\n\n### 3.1.1 Performance\n\nLyra Chain will offer Lyra’s users a dedicated execution environment for the protocol, improving several facets of performance relative to the experience on Optimism and Arbitrum. Users can expect the following benefits:\n\n1. Faster confirmations (reduced latency) due to having a dedicated sequencer.\n2. Cheaper transactions and a clear path to an order of magnitude reduction with EIP-4844 which will be adopted by Lyra Chain. \n3. Less congestion due to not having to compete with other protocols and their users.\n\n### 3.1.2 Usability\n\nLyra Chain is being built to provide one of the best user experiences of any on-chain project:\n\n1. It will include a fast bridge that enables users to deposit and withdraw from Ethereum and rollups including Optimism, Arbitrum and others. \n2. Users of Lyra Chain won’t have to understand or manage gas. Meta transactions enable users to trade without directly paying gas fees, enabled by third-party relayers.\n3. Lyra Chain will proactively integrate native account abstraction features to build a best in class transaction experience.\n\n### 3.1.3 Security\n\nLike any rollup, Lyra Chain inherits the security of Ethereum by moving computation off-chain to a centralized sequencer while ensuring sufficient data is available to reconstruct valid state in the event of maliciousness or downtime. In its final state, Lyra chain will be able to provide the following guarantees:\n\n1. Liveness - Providing a trustless escape hatch that allows users to withdraw assets in case of sequencer downtime.\n2. Censorship Resistance - The ability to transact via Ethereum if the sequencer is actively censoring the user.\n3. Dispute Resolution - Creating a fraud-proof to challenge an invalid state root in the case of a malicious sequencer.\n\nIt is important to note that these security features are still under active development.\n\n## 3.2 Lyra Protocol\n\nThe Lyra Protocol is a series of smart contracts deployed on Lyra Chain. There are three main components to the Protocol: subaccounts, managers and assets. The Protocol is modular by design, allowing for swift iteration, meaning many of these layers will be further enhanced over time. We now outline the protocol at a high level (for further detail, see the [whitepaper](https://www.lyra.finance/files/v2-whitepaper.pdf)). \n\n![PrettyDiagram.png](ipfs://bafkreigoqigdbej4u6izezewaoswtdkgu4hncn3hgufmwrhmj5veghqrri)\n \n\n### 3.2.1 Subaccounts\n\nSubaccounts are the base unit of the Protocol. All users will be able to permissionlessly mint a subaccount entity which houses all of their supported assets. Subaccounts are ERC-721 compliant NFTs and have two main functionalities:\n\n1) Ensure only authorized parties are able to change the subaccount’s balances.\n\n2) Inform all relevant parties about any trade involving the subaccount.\n\nThis was made possible through the use of **hooks**; external function calls to relevant contracts that occur during and after any asset transfer. There are two such hooks: \n\n1) the **asset hook** (invokes the asset to validate transfers) and \n\n2) the **manager hook** (which calls the manager to authenticate the final state of the subaccount). \n\n### 3.2.2 Assets\n\nAn asset contract is responsible for determining the results of a transfer, trade, deposit, withdrawal or settlement. To support deposits and withdrawals, as well as interest accrual, an asset has the privilege to update its own balances in any subaccount. \n\nAt launch, there will be four types of assets available:\n\n1) **cashAsset**: Each manager supports one cashAsset. This is referred to as the *quote* asset.\n\n2) **option**: European options on a given underlying asset.\n\n3) **perp**: Perpetual futures on a given underlying.\n\n4) **wrappedERC20**: Wrapped ERC20 tokens like wBTC. \n\nBalances for wrapped assets can only be credits (longs) whereas all other assets can be credits or debits (longs or shorts). \n\nAssets and managers are linked; certain assets will only be supported by specific managers and vice versa. This relationship is maintained via the aforementioned **hooks**.\n\nEach risk manager supports a single quote asset. As with options and perpetuals, users can hold credit or debt balances of the quote asset. Unlike these other assets, users with debit balances will have to pay interest on this sum. This interest is then paid out to all other users with credit balances. Thus, the quote asset facilitates a native lending market over its supported managers.\n\nAt launch, USDC will be the only supported quote asset.\n\n### 3.2.3 Managers\n\nManagers are smart contracts that govern the margin requirements of subscribed subaccounts. At launch, there will be two managers available: the standard risk manager (SRM) and portfolio margin risk manager (PMRM). When creating a subaccount, the user must subscribe to one of these risk managers.\n\nManagers fulfil the following functions: \n\n1) *Setting Margin Rules*: Managers set the margin requirements of all supported subaccounts. To avoid being subject to liquidation, users must satisfy their maintenance margin mandate. To open a new position, the user must fulfil their (stricter) initial margin requirements.\n\n2) *Liquidations*: Managers define the conditions for and enforce liquidations.\n\n3) *Settlement*: The managers are responsible for settling all trades.\n\n### 3.2.4 Standard Risk Manager\n\nThis supports USDC, various base assets (say, wBTC), options and perpetuals and has the following key features:\n\n- *Cross Margin*: traders use all quote and base balances as collateral for all open positions in a subaccount. Isolated margin is obtained by opening a separate subaccount.\n- *Multi-asset collateral*: traders will be able to use various base asset to collateralize their perpetuals and options. For instance, a user will be able to collateralize a short BTC perpetual with ETH.\n- *Capital Efficient Spreads*: Single short options will the require mark-to-market value of the option and a percentage of the spot as margin. However, the SRM is able to cap the margin requirement of spreads to their maximum loss. This means, for example, that a long $1500/$1800 call spread will require precisely $0 of collateral (and the short spread will be capped at $300).\n- *Leveraged Perpetuals*: Perpetuals can be traded using the SRM with high capital efficiency.\n- *Borrowing*: If enabled, users can borrow the quote asset against their wrapped ERC20 base assets\n\n### 3.2.5 Portfolio Margin Risk Manager\n\nThis also supports USDC, a single denominated base asset and corresponding options and perpetuals. Consequently, if a user wishes to use portfolio margin to trade ETH options and BTC options, then two PMRM subaccounts will be required.\n\nMargin requirements are set using portfolio margin, where the entire portfolio is holistically evaluated at many spot and volatility shock scenarios. The scenario which results in the greatest loss is used, along with extra contingency margin, to set the margin requirements. \n\nNote that both managers use the **Black76** pricing model to mark options. Options settle to a weighted combination of the twap of spot and forward price.\n\nFinally, we note that due to the large number of **Black76** function calls, portfolio margin computations are very gas intensive. To avoid limiting PMRM account sizes, entities approved by governance called trusted risk assessors will be able to bypass all but one risk (namely, the mark to-market, i.e. solvency) check on chain.\n\nWhile it is possible for trusted risk assessors to approve transactions that result in liquidatable (but not insolvent!) positions, such accounts can be immediately liquidated by any willing participant, removing this risk from the system. Further, the trusted risk assessor role can be revoked if the party in question is found to be acting improperly.\n\n### 3.2.6 Partial Liquidations\n\nUsers who fall beneath their margin requirements are subject to a partial liquidation. Liquidations will be a transparent process and open to all participants, i.e. any user can act as a liquidator and the user being liquidated will be able to monitor their subaccount throughout this process.\n\nThe liquidation mechanism is designed to expeditiously remove risk from the system while at the same time ensuring the most beneficial user experience for traders being liquidated.\n\nAny user can call the function **liquidate** on any subaccount that is not meeting its maintenance margin requirements. The following then takes place: \n\n- The user’s entire portfolio is put up for auction by its manager.\n- The auction begins at a small percentage discount to the portfolio’s mark-to-market value and progressively increases to incentivise liquidators to take on the account.\n- Liquidators can agree to take on any percentage of the portfolio at the current discounted auction price. However, this percentage is capped. This bound is a function of the mark-to-market value of the portfolio and its current margin requirements.\n- If the portfolio is not liquidated after a sufficient period of time, an insolvent auction begins. Liquidators are paid by the Security Module to take on the portfolio.\n- If the Security Module runs out of funds to pay off insolvent debt, then the debt is distributed to all traders via a *temporary withdrawal fee*.\n\n### 3.2.7 Protocol Fees\n\nEvery risk bearing entity in the architecture can receive fees for doing so. The protocol has three main sources of fee generation, all of which accrue to the protocol owned security module which, when developed, will improve the robustness and resiliency of the protocol:\n\n1. *Trading fees*: All transactions that increase the open interest (and therefore risk) of the system will be charged a fee. This fee will be a function of the spot price of the underlying asset and size of the trade.\n2.  *Liquidation fees*: Users who are liquidated will be charged a small fee that scales with the risk of their account.\n3.  *Interest rate spreads*: A percentage of all interest paid by negative cash holders is reserved for the security module.\n\nEntities approved by governance can bypass the trading fee in exchange for, say, a different fee scheme pledge. These approvals can be rescinded if the entity does not meet its requirements.\n\n### 3.2.8 Parameters and Governance\n\nThere are many parameters that govern the protocol; this is especially true for the managers. These parameters also have to be updated whenever there is a market shift to ensure both capital efficiency and security for traders.\n\nAll parameters in the protocol are controlled by a smart contract that will b owned by Lyra Governance (i.e. the short executor).\n\n### 3.2.9 Data Feeds\n\nThe managers require oracles to provide the following data in order to accurately assess and control risk: \n\n- *Implied volatility (IV)*: IV for supported tenors will be provided as raw stochastic volatility inspired (SVI) surfaces. These are specified by 5 parameters: (a, b, ρ, m, e).\n- *Forwards*: The forward price for supported tenors is also supplied. Close to expiration, this becomes a linear combination of the TWAP of the underlying and forward price. The weights, as well as the length of the TWAP, are dependent on the time to settlement.\n- *Risk free rates*: This is an interest rate curve defined at each supported tenor.\n- *Spot*: This is the spot (index) price of the underlying assets (ETH, BTC) sourced from multiple outlets.\n- *Perpetual Price*: This is the market price of the perpetual.\n\nEach piece of data supplied also has an associated confidence score. Low confidence feeds result in extra initial margin being required for both the SRM and PMRM.\n\n## 3.3 Lyra Matcher\n\nLyra Matcher is an open-source order-matching engine that enables high-performance and low-latency matching at zero cost. It will support all major order types as well as REST and WebSocket APIs for developers. More information on the matcher will be released in a subsequent proposal.\n\n## 3.4 Governance\n\nLyra DAO has an on-chain [governance](https://gov.lyra.finance/dao/overview) model that enables stkLYRA holders to govern Lyra Chain, Lyra Protocol and the treasury. This system also enables service providers (anyone adding value to the ecosystem) to apply for funding. Service providers range from core contributors that work on the protocol to market makers and infrastructure providers.\n \n![Screen Shot 2023-07-27 at 5.07.11 pm.png](ipfs://bafkreiarjnh7i52gs34un7r4vdhxbstielj26orulhfj2trlde3texyz5y)\n    \n\n### 3.4.1 On-chain Governance\n\nIn Lyra V2, on-chain governance will be responsible for various functions across the protocol, chain and treasury:\n\nProtocol\n\n- Setting Parameters\n- Launching and deprecating markets\n\nChain\n\n- Accumulating transaction fees from transactions\n- Acting as owner of the sequencer\n- Upgrading code\n\nTreasury\n\n- Approve/reject funding requests from service providers\n\n### 3.4.2 Foundation\n\nThis proposal introduces the Lyra Foundation, a not-for-profit legal entity that aims to support the Protocol’s decentralized growth. The Foundation will be able to contract with other entities to provide services for the DAO. The reason for the existence of the foundation is that some service providers cannot deal directly with the DAO via on-chain governance. Some examples are:\n\n1. Those hosting off-chain infrastructure (rollup sequencer and order book) on behalf of the DAO.\n2. Agreements and incentive structures to foster liquidity on the Lyra Chain. \n3. Providers related to licensing and compliance objectives.\n\nThus the foundation can help Lyra DAO bootstrap the success of V2 much faster. Over time, these functions are expected to be replaced by service providers who can interface with the DAO. At this point, the foundation will be decommissioned. If this proposal is successful, the following assets will be transferred from the DAO to the foundation:\n\n| Asset | Amount |\n| --- | --- |\n| LYRA | 100,000,000 |\n| OP | 750,000 |\n| USDC | 1,500,000 |\n\n### 3.4.2.1 Foundation Key Activities and OKRs\n\nInspired by [Uniswap governance](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/governance-proposal-create-the-uniswap-foundation/17499). We propose a number of initial OKRs for the foundation. Its possible that these OKRs will need to change in the future, and if they do, the Foundation must communicate that to the community. \n\n| Objective | Key Results |\n| --- | --- |\n| Grow protocol activity | Allocate 50% of LYRA funding, and 70% of OP funding to construct long-term aligned liquidity agreements via market makers and protocol integrations on the Lyra Chain. Success will be measured by metrics including (but not limited to): volume, new users, security module fees generated per incentive.  |\n| Support continuous protocol development  | Allocate 20% of LYRA funding, 30% of OP funding and 100% of USDC funding to contract with relevant service providers (including core contributors) to develop protocol functionality, including (but not limited to): AMM design and development, automated strategy vaults, new collateral onboarding, autonomous hedging vaults, new partnerships. Success to be measured against metrics including (but not limited to): number of new integrations, integration time for developers, integration volumes.  |\n| Act as an advocate for the protocol  | Take advantage of beneficial opportunities on behalf of the protocol.

      "title": "[LRFC] Discontinue BTC Vault on Arbitrum",
      "content": "Simple Summary:\n\nThe proposal entails discontinuing the BTC vault on Arbitrum, redirecting liquidity and volume towards Optimistic Ethereum (OP), given the higher fees on GMX and fragmented liquidity between OP and Arbitrum, detrimental to LPs.\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis LEAP aims to discontinue the BTC vault operating on the Arbitrum layer. Given the higher costs associated with GMX fees and the fragmented liquidity due to split volume between OP and Arbitrum, it is proposed to focus our resources and liquidity on the Optimistic Ethereum deployment.\n\nMotivation:\n\nCurrently, the BTC vault is operating on both OP and Arbitrum. However, this fragmented liquidity leads to less efficient markets and potentially higher slippage for traders. Moreover, GMX fees are relatively high, and by focusing liquidity on OP, we can leverage the cheaper costs associated with Synthetix Perps, making it more profitable for LPs. The feedback from traders regarding their preferred chain is highly encouraged and appreciated.\n\nSpecification\nOverview\nThe process of discontinuing the BTC vault on Arbitrum will entail directing future liquidity and trading activity to the existing BTC vault on Optimistic Ethereum.\n\nRationale\nThis LEAP proposes discontinuing the BTC vault on Arbitrum due to the higher costs and inefficiencies it creates. Given the better cost structure and liquidity concentration benefits associated with the Optimistic Ethereum deployment, this proposal aims to benefit both traders and LPs.\n\nTechnical Specification\nThis transition does not involve launching a new vault; instead, it refers to halting the operations of the existing BTC vault on Arbitrum. The focus will be redirected to the Optimistic Ethereum deployment. However, more trader feedback is needed to ensure this move aligns with the community’s needs and preferences.\n\nConfigurable Values\nGiven that this is a discontinuation of the BTC vault on Arbitrum, there will be no initialization of new configurable values. Existing settings and values for the BTC vault on Optimistic Ethereum will remain.\n\nImpact and Risks\nDiscontinuing the BTC vault on Arbitrum could potentially impact those traders who prefer this chain. However, this proposal is directed towards streamlining operations, reducing costs, and improving the trading experience by consolidating liquidity in one place. Feedback from traders is crucial in this decision-making process.\n\nNext Steps\nCommunity discussion and voting on this proposal will be crucial. Following community approval, operations on the BTC vault on Arbitrum will be discontinued, and all resources will be redirected towards Optimistic Ethereum.",

      "title": "[LRFC] Update for ongoing Lyra protocol incentives",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nModify ongoing liquidity incentives across all markets.\n\n## Abstract\n\nRebalance incentives across all markets to help drive more volume towards the most popular markets. Also, move more incentives towards Optimism as both the cost of hedging is reduced and there are more funds available for incentives (OP).\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe funding rate on GMX is negatively affecting the ongoing profitability of the Arbitrum deployment. As such, this rebalance of incentives aims to reduce the total outstanding volume of the market, as well as correct incentives on markets that are both overutilized and underutilized.\n\n## Specification\n\nSome of the values are conditional depending on the result of other LRFCs passing. Specifically:\n\n- [Arbitrum BTC market deprecation](https://snapshot.org/#/lyra.eth/proposal/0x048a5af0454a8e17b19447fdaffd88d8047e3b2a31c43d1ca506d691f5333231): this vote passing would result in the proposed new rewards being set to 0\n\n## Rationale\n\nValues were determined through a calculation of comparing current pool utilization (peak over last 7 days) to a target utilization of 85%. This works out a target pool size, which is floored at $200k. The target pool size is then multiplied by a target APY of ~10% and current token value to work out the fortnightly reward. This final value is then rounded to 3 significant digits.\n\nGiven the desire to move more incentives towards the Optimism deployment, trading rewards on Arbitrum are also reduced by 60%.\n\n## Test Cases\n\nN/A\n\n## Configurable Values\n\n### Optimism markets\n\nmarket | current epoch rewards | proposed new rewards\n-|-|-\nETH | 13300 OP | 14600 OP\nBTC | 1900 OP | 2270 OP\nARB | 1900 OP | 603 OP\nOP | 1900 OP | 603 OP\nLINK | 0 | 603 OP\nXRP | 0 | 603 OP\nTrading rewards | 7500 OP | 7500 OP\n\n### Arbitrum markets\n\nmarket | current epoch rewards | proposed new rewards\n-|-|-\nETH | 433000 lyra | 255000 lyra\nBTC | 333000 lyra | 125000 lyra / 0 lyra*\nTrading rewards | 66000 lyra | 26400 lyra\n\n\\* Value is dependent on logic defined in Specification section\n\n## Copyright Waiver\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via [CC0 ](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).",

      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nLaunch an XRP market on the Optimistic Ethereum, using SNX Perps V2 market as the hedging venue.\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis LRFC proposes launching the XRP market on the Optimistic Ethereum deployment. It will be initialized with four boards which expire 7, 14, 21, and 28 days following launch (all at 8 am UTC time). Each board will have several strikes listed as required for a functional market.\n\nMotivation Lyra’s AMM mechanism generalizes to any asset with a liquid spot market. XRP is now tradeable on Synthetix’s perps V2, as such, the addition of an XRP market would increase the range of assets available to traders. As well as allow hedging by XRP holders to hedge their exposure.\n\n## Motivation\n\nBy launching an XRP market on Optimism, we can expand the available assets for traders and enable XRP holders to hedge their exposure effectively. Adding the XRP market to the existing infrastructure aligns with our goal of offering diverse trading opportunities to the Lyra Ecosystem.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nThe work required to launch the XRP market will not require additional contracts compared to the already deployed markets. The process for launching will require periphery updates to the surrounding infrastructure.\n\n## Incentives\n\nThere will be no incentives for this market, the market will not begin trading until at least 200k USDC has been deposited into the vault. If incentives are needed for the market to function this can be amended in a later LRFC proposal.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis LRFC proposes launching the XRP market alongside the ETH, BTC, OP, and ARB markets. The previously launched markets on the new, Newport version have been performing as expected, and adding additional markets to the optimism deployment will give traders an increased range of assets to trade against.\n\n## Technical Specification\n\nLiquidity: The XRP market will be deployed in deposit-only mode with a 3-day period allowing for capital to move into the pool before trading is subsequently opened.\n\nOptions will be listed with 7, 14, 21, and 28-day expiries from launch.\n\n## Test Cases\n\n### Optimism Markets\n\nBTC: https://app.lyra.finance/#/trade/optimism/wbtc-usdc\n\nETH: https://app.lyra.finance/#/trade/optimism/weth-usdc\n\nOP: https://app.lyra.finance/#/trade/optimism/op-usdc\n\nARB: https://app.lyra.finance/#/trade/optimism/arb-usdc\n\n## Configurable Values\n\nConfigurable values will be initialized to have a similar surface to the OP surface.",

As Arbitrum token incentives come to an end, we will need to continue to incentivize LPs using Lyra.\n\n# Motivation\nAs the DAO has emitted most of the tokens that it was supplied during the Arbitrum token drop, liquidity incentives will have to be moved to Lyra on Arbitrum. The Optimism deploy will continue to emit incentives in OP tokens.\n\n# Implementation\n## Optimism\nPool Amount per Epoch(OP)\nETH 13.3 K\nBTC 1.9k\nOP 1.9k\nARB 1.9k\n\n## Arbitrum\nPool Amount Per Epoch(Lyra)\nETH 433k\nBTC 333k\n\n## Trading Rewards\nOptimism: 7.5K OP\nArbitrum: 66.6k Lyra\n\n# Rationale\nThe transition plan for LP incentives post ARB incentives completion demonstrates Lyra Finance’s commitment to sustainable growth and long-term success. By carefully managing the transition and adjusting token emissions, the project can maintain a healthy token distribution, prevent excessive token inflation, and foster a resilient ecosystem for liquidity providers. This approach ensures the project’s continued ability to incentivize and reward participants.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\nAll LEAPs must be in the public domain.

      "content": "Simple Summary:\nDeploy a ListingManager contract on all option markets to fully automate the process of listing boards and strikes.\n\nAbstract:\nThe Lyra Automated Market Maker (AMM) has successfully provided trustless competitive option pricing on-chain. However, the current process of listing new strikes and expiries on the AMM is unpredictable and often causes inconvenience to traders and integrators.\n\nThis proposal aims to elucidate the process of listing strikes and expiries on the Lyra Newport deploys on Optimism and Arbitrum. The proposed ListingManager contract allows for the trustless and permissionless listing of strikes and expiries. It utilizes a queue-execute model where strikes are executed after a minimum required queue time. This will allow anyone to queue the creation of new boards and strikes, allowing for more systematic and predictable listings of boards.\n\nMotivation:\nThe motivation behind designing the automated strikes and expiries contract is to simplify and streamline the process of listing strikes on the AMM. By automating the strike listing process, the contract aims to create stability in listings and enhance the experience for users and integrators.\n\nSpecification:\nListingManager:\n\nThe automated strikes and expiries contract generates and adds strikes and expiries to the AMM. It calculates the implied volatility of the listing based on previous boards, interpolating and extrapolating where necessary. A risk council elected by token holders will have the ability to veto boards as a precautionary measure. The listing of strikes follows a queue-execute model, where a minimum required queue time is enforced before a board is pushed to the AMM.\n\nWhenever the option market circuit breakers are live, all queued boards/strikes are cleared, and no new boards/strikes can be queued until it is over.\n\nListingManagerLibrarySettings:\n\nA contract that contains an array of ‘pivot’ values that are used to calculate the expiries and strikes that will be listed relative to the previous boards.\n\nStrikePriceGenerator:\n\nAutomatically generates strike prices for various expiries as spot fluctuates.\n\nRationale:\nThe automated strikes and expiries contract offers several advantages, including increased predictability, transparency and certainty, aiming to enable increased reliability for integrators and traders.\n\nOptimism risk council: 0xf6f583141590577eae48a99b7f09ad3a7274ce40\n\nArbitrum risk council: 0xca2d65d1bab8e1a426c7ccab8d54bad239baef1a\n\nPer market parameter differences:\nOP/ARB: max expiry: 6 weeks\n\nETH/BTC: max expiry 8 weeks (both OP/ARB)\n\nTest Cases:\nRepo:\n\n\nGitHub\n\nGitHub - lyra-finance/listing-manager: Contracts for automatic generation of... 3\nContracts for automatic generation of boards, strikes and initial volatilities - GitHub - lyra-finance/listing-manager: Contracts for automatic generation of boards, strikes and initial volatilities",

      "content": "Agora aims to make governance participation a frictionless and transparent process. We believe a robust governance process is key to attracting higher quality contributors, better ROI proposals, and ultimately what enables an ecosystem to grow and thrive.\n\nWe’ve seen success in terms of an increase in the participation rate and new delegates from our experience helping Optimism, Uniswap, ENS, and Nouns. However, each DAO is unique in its own ecosystem. As a result, we plan to implement a feature-rich experience that’s tailored towards what Lyra’s ecosystem needs.\n\nThe initial scope of Lyra Agora v1 is to focus on the immediate task at hand:\n\nEnable delegate discovery\nEnable easier delegation\nOver time, our mission at Agora is to make governance a first-class experience, tailored for Lyra delegates and build a dedicated client that helps reduce friction and enable transparency with the aim to help grow the ecosystem.\n\nWe are a dedicated team that will continue to maintain, improve, and host the site for Lyra. We will be responsible for fixing bugs, troubleshooting customer support and taking in community feedback to make improvements towards the app.\n\nTechnical Specification\nKey Features:\n\nDelegate discovery page\nSorting — enable sorting by: most voting power, most delegators, most active, random\nFilters — enable filters by: Issues, Stakeholders (out of scope for v1, but for v2, we’d love to look at integrating other credentials)\nDelegation interface — simple, easy-to-use interface for delegation for anyone. They can also see at any time, who they delegated to and their own voting power and token balances.\nDelegate’s Page & Statement Creation\nDelegate statement creation — simple to use delegate statement creation wizard and profile page for each delegate that connects their wallet.\nGovernance data feed — delegate’s statement data will be open-sourced and streamed and accessible publicly for anyone else to build on top of. Committed to making all delegate data available and via a shared open-data standard.\nLyra customization\nLyra specific subdomain — While we will host the site and be responsible for all of the costs of hosting and maintenance (guaranteed for 12 months), we enable the site to live on Lyra’s custom sub-domain of choosing rather than our own. E.g. gov.lyra.finance\nLyra white-labeled design — on the landing page as well as delegate’s default avatars.\nTimeline: after the proposal passes, we aim to launch the v1 of Lyra Agora in 4-6 weeks.\n\nRationale\nDedicated governance portal — Trust and ease of use is a key factor when it comes to increasing governance participation from the community. To combat voter apathy, we believe a tailored client will reduce barriers of entry. This way we can link out to Lyra’s FAQ, show Lyra specific metrics, etc.\nSubdomain — we believe enabling Agora to live natively on the DAO’s page accomplish 2 things: (1) increase ease of use for users and (2) risk mitigation in case that the DAO wishes to replace Agora in the future. They can do this without interrupting user’s experience with a new domain of any sort.\nBackend indexer — we believe speed and reliability is important as critical governance decisions often happen in a short span of time. As a result, we’ve chosen to deploy a custom indexer for each DAO. An alternative solution could’ve been The Graph.\nWallet compatibilities — to reduce testing complexity, we’re primarily testing with the popular EOAs like Metamask, Coinbase Wallet and Taho. We also support eth gnosis safe multi-sigs. For the v1 of Agora, we will not be immediately compatible with custom deployed wallets or ERC-1271.\n\nTest Cases\nWe have a launch checklist to make sure all the features work and are stress tested. However, the primary features are listed above.\n\nConfigurable Values\nN/A\n",

      "title": "[LRFC] SNX Perps V2 hedging and Cash Collateralization on Optimism",
      "content": "|Author|GUNBOATs, 2Mastermojo83, Ksett|\n|Status|Draft|\n\nSimple Summary\nIntegrate Lyra with Synthetix Perps V2 and deploy a cash-collateralized version of the contracts on Optimism.\n\nAbstract\nDeploy a new version of the Lyra protocol to Optimism, using SNX V2 perpetual futures as the source of liquidity with which to delta hedge the AMM, and launch Newport markets on ETH, BTC, ARB & OP on Optimism. These contracts will support USDC as a quoteAsset, whilst using wETH, wBTC, and native tokens (e.g. UNI) as collateral against short call positions as well as routing the hedger to swap USDC to sUSD (or snxUSD in future versions).\n\nMotivation\nAfter the success of Lyra’s cash-collateralized Newport version on Arbitrum, this LEAP proposes to apply a similar mechanism and improve capital efficiency in Lyra’s Optimism deployment by removing the need for the AMM to lock one baseAsset (i.e. sETH) per call sold. To achieve this, the pool will instead hold a significant portion against the options in cash and all quoteAsset funds held by the pool will be available for delta hedging.\n\nNotably, not being fully collateralized opens the pool to possible insolvency. To handle these black swan events, contract adjustments will be introduced which reduce long holder positions, allowing all long holders to get an equal share, and preventing the LP from being emptied fully.\n\nThis deployment will normalize the AMMs returns and lessen the protocol’s reliance on rebates and direct integration fees from Synthetix to provide competitive bid/ask spreads.\n\nSpecification\nThe Lyra protocol’s Optimism contracts will need to be modified to handle quoteAsset and baseAsset ERC20 tokens.\n\nThe SynthetixAdapter will be replaced by a SynthetixPerpAdapter contract. The SynthetixPerpAdapter will be responsible for handling swapping covered call collateral (baseAsset) collected at settlement and during liquidations into quoteAsset on Uniswap.\n\nIncentives:\nthis LEAP redistributes the 90K OP that were allocated to Lyra’s Avalon Vaults for rewards epochs 3-6 to the newly launched Newport pools as follows:\n\nETH BTC ARB OP\nEpoch 3: 13K 2K 2K 2k\nEpoch 4: 13K 2K 2K 2K\nEpoch 5: 13K 2K 2K 2K\nEpoch 6: 13K 2K 2K 2K\n\nDelta Hedging\nThe ShortPoolHedger will be replaced by a SNXFuturesPoolHedger contract. This will be responsible for opening and managing perpetual future positions against the SNX pool to delta-hedge the liquidity pool.\n\nThe hedger will be responsible for swapping USDC into sUSD prior to hedging the MMV with SNX Perps and trading sUSD that is not being used to hedge back into USDC. The hedger should also check the premium/discount function on SNX Perps prior to allowing trades, hedging, or liquidating after settlement, blocking short delta trades if the premium is too high and blocking long delta trades if the discount is too high. Trades and hedges should both be blocked if the premium/discount is over a certain % until the market has had a chance to normalize. Within the SNXFuturesPoolHedger target leverage can be specified, allowing for greater capital efficiency of the Liquidity Pool funds being used to hedge.\n\nLiquidity Pool Changes\nThere will be an additional canHedge check added to the LiquidityPool contract, which will block the opening of trades when the hedging module (SNXFuturesPoolHedger) deems the position to increase risk beyond an acceptable threshold (i.e. the delta exposure increases beyond the available hedging liquidity on SNX).\n\nRationale\nBy integrating with multiple perpetual futures platforms, the resiliency of the protocol to an individual shock to one of them increases. Optimism has a vibrant defi community and by deploying the most capital-efficient version of the protocol, we can provide the most competitive and liquid markets to our integrators within the Optimism ecosystem Further, the use of USDC as quote collateral (and wrapped ETH/BTC + native collateral for DeFi tokens), will increase the pool liquidity available to Lyra for use within the protocol. Using a Curve integration to swap to sUSD in order to hedge will decrease our reliance on spot synthetic assets and minimize any scaling issues around sUSD supply. Furthermore, the sUSD 3-curve pools has $41m TVL which should handle hedging with ease.\n\nSynthetix Perps V2 will significantly reduce perps trading fees to only 5-10 basis points while maintaining optimal performance and execution efficiency. These reduced fees will open up endless opportunities and growth within the Lyra ecosystem.\n\nNew off-chain oracles provided by Pyth Network allow perps fees to be reduced to 5-10bps—on par with centralized perps platforms. These oracles, pioneered by SNX, greatly improve the trader experience & minimize the risk of frontrunning attacks. They work as follows: off-chain oracles save prices off-chain and are provided to traders by keepers when a trade is initiated, with an 8-sec delay due to block times. The on-chain validation process includes staleness checks, key-threshold confirmation, and a final check against on-chain oracles. This has improved from spot trading fees which ranged from 30-100bps, reducing cost by 6-10x.\n\nThe price impact function of SNX Perps V2 incentivizes arbitrage traders with a price discount given to traders who return markets to neutral. Funding rate changes allow funding rates to drift upwards in the presence of continued imbalance, incentivizing arbitrage traders to step in.\n\nBoth functions will introduce arbitrage opportunities for traders to keep markets neutral over the long term. This innovative path to risk management will help increase scalability and capital efficiency while supporting a wider range of markets.\n\nSynthetix recently released 22 new perpetual futures for the total of 23 markets as in writing of this LEAP.

      "title": "[LRFC] Market Making Proposal - Arrakis PALM",
      "content": "# Simple Summary\n\nDeploy Arrakis PALM to conduct market-making for LYRA/WETH with Lyra POL on mainnet UniV3.\n\n# Abstract\n\nArrakis PALM - Protocol Automated Liquidity Management - built by Arrakis Finance 1, is a novel liquidity bootstrapping mechanism that taps into the organic trading volume on UniV3. It is the first product built on top of the Arrakis infrastructure.\n\nIn essence, PALM helps protocols bootstrap their base asset inventory (ETH, DAI, etc.) and attain deep and sustainable liquidity. The major advantages of using PALM include:\n\n- Zero incentive: no LM incentive needed, liquidity bootstrapping is done solely via market making.\n- Low requirement in base asset: the initial liquidity can be made of mostly LYRA, and PALM will progressively balance it towards 50% to create an equal buy/sell support.\n- High capital efficiency: by autonomously and actively managing concentrated liquidity, especially once a sufficient amount of base asset has been bootstrapped, PALM can further reduce the slippage for large trades even if with limited overall liquidity.\n- No biased price impact: PALM conducts market making by setting up ranges / limit orders, no swaps involved.\n- Trustless & transparency: Lyra retains the ownership of the liquidity and can withdraw at all times. PALM only autonomously manages the liquidity but can never remove it. All executions of PALM can be monitored on-chain with full transparency.\n\nHere is an example 2 for GEL/WETH that demonstrates the overall performance of PALM and how it’s able to bootstrap and deepen the liquidity regardless of the price action.\n\nArrakis has been assisting Lyra with liquidity management since long ago (see LEAP-21 and LEAP-44 1), and we would like to strengthen this long-term relationship with more and better services that can further benefit the Lyra community.\n\n# Motivation\n\nCurrently, there are two major challenges in terms of LYRA liquidity:\n\n1. High liquidity rental cost: a large amount of LYRA is given away as LM incentives (5m LYRA annually as in LEAP-44 1) to LPs that are most probably going to leave once the reward runs low. Renting liquidity is never a sustainable solution and eventually does more harm than good to the protocol and token holders.\n2. Low capital efficiency: Bulk of LYRA liquidity resides in Velodrome, a constant function market maker that only accepts full range liquidity provision. There is also LYRA liquidity on UniV3. Although UniV3 can significantly improve capital efficiency by the concentrated liquidity feature, the complexity and lack of sophisticated management makes the capital efficiency for LYRA still far from being ideal.\n\nAll of this presents both a huge cost and a missed opportunity for Lyra. The liquidity incentive could have been reserved for better purposes that contribute to the development of the protocol, and Lyra could have consistently pocketed a handsome amount of trading fees by LPing with high capital efficiency to absorb most of the volume.\n\nTo help Lyra save the cost and capture the opportunity, Arrakis proposes to provide Lyra with the full spectrum of market-making services on UniV3 with PALM to bootstrap and create deep on-chain liquidity.\n\n# Specification\n\n## Phase 1 - Accumulate base asset\n\nBased on the discussions with the Lyra core team, we suggest that Lyra initially deposit $100k worth of ETH and $200k worth of LYRA (roughly 67 WETH and 1845491 LYRA at the time of writing the proposal) into a PALM-managed vault. PALM will pull that ratio towards 50/50 over time.\n\nThere are three key parameters that dictate PALM’s behavior:\n\n- Range size (S): the number of ticks in a range\n- Allocation (L): the percentage of liquidity deployed in a range\n- Threshold (T): the boundary across which a rebalance is called\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihnqu7ryl5goqqiuv2hwkfvo2evtpvqi24bbnezqv5nompjykmcyi)\n    \nAfter running a series of simulations for LYRA/WETH, the proposed values for these parameters are:\n\n- Range size: 600 ticks (see official explanation 1 of tick from Uniswap)\n- Allocation: 5% total allocation (the rest stays in the vault as reserve readily to be deployed)\n  -1.5% base range\n  -1.0% mid range\n  -2.5% asset range\n- Threshold:\n  -Asset rebalance: 480 ticks from asset range limit towards mid range\n  -Base rebalance: 120 ticks from base range limit towards mid range\n\nWith the values above, the simulation results indicate that PALM can effectively bootstrap WETH for LYRA over 3 months, and at the same time keep the value of the deposited liquidity close to the value of holding.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihibbrkih4puagci227na2b47epwtdnfgv3gelyatnphbyullwl54)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicdfg2xyhirrhtdkwvwci3aakd57irti26cbhamg32tmh3dlm4hz4)\n        \n## Phase 2 - Establish deep liquidity\n\nOnce the target ratio of 50/50 is reached, the focus is then on market-making to create deep liquidity for LYRA and to minimize the slippage on both the buy and sell side of the volume.\n\nDuring the deployment period, the Lyra community has complete visibility into the execution and performance of PALM via a custom dashboard, and retains full custody of the liquidity in the vault, which means that the Lyra community can withdraw from the vault or revoke managing access from PALM at any time. PALM can only conduct market-making with the liquidity deposited in the vault and will never be able to remove the fund.\n\nFor the services provided, Arrakis charges fees on two fronts:\n\n- Management fee: 1% AUM fee on a yearly basis\n- Performance fee: 50% of trading fees generated.\n\n# Copyright Waiver\nAll LEAPs must be in the public domain.

      "title": "[LRFC] Lyra Delegation Portal - Lyra Agora v1",
      "content": "DRAFT\n- Charlie Feng ([@zcf](https://forums.lyra.finance/u/zcf), Twitter: [@charliecfeng](https://twitter.com/charliecfeng))\n- Requires: LEAP 51\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nDelegates portal for Lyra governance.\n\n## Abstract\n\nWith the move to on-chain governance ([LEAP 51](https://leaps.lyra.finance/leaps/leap-51/)), delegation becomes a key component of a vibrant governance ecosystem. This LEAP proposes building a delegates portal for the Lyra community.\n\nSpecifically, this Lyra Agora v1 will enable two key functions:\n\n- Allow delegates to create statements and customize their profiles. Help bring more voices to the community.\n- Allow delegators to discover high quality delegates to whom they can delegate entrust to make decisions on their behalf.\n\nThis LEAP requires Lyra DAO to provide:\n\n- A grant of 250,000 LYRA to Agora’s multi-sig, 50% upfront, 50% at launch of Lyra Agora v1 site.\n\n## Motivation\n\nDelegation is a key step in scaling an on-chain community. We want to bring this to Lyra as Lyra moves to on-chain governance.\n\nWe hope this helps retain and reward existing long-time users of the community who has Lyra’s best interest at heart and can further make an impact. We also hope that this will help bring new voices to the community.\n\n## Specification\n\n### Overview\n\nAgora aims to make governance participation a frictionless and transparent process. We believe a robust governance process is key to attracting higher quality contributors, better ROI proposals, and ultimately what enables an ecosystem to grow and thrive. \n\nWe’ve seen success in terms of an increase in the participation rate and new delegates from our experience helping Optimism, Uniswap, ENS, and Nouns. However, each DAO is unique in its own ecosystem. As a result, we plan to implement a feature-rich experience that’s tailored towards what Lyra’s ecosystem needs.\n\nThe initial scope of Lyra Agora v1 is to focus on the immediate task at hand:\n\n- Enable delegate discovery\n- Enable easier delegation\n\nOver time, our mission at Agora is to make governance a first-class experience, tailored for Lyra delegates and build a dedicated client that helps reduce friction and enable transparency with the aim to help grow the ecosystem. \n\nWe are a dedicated team that will continue to maintain, improve, and host the site for Lyra. We will be responsible for fixing bugs, troubleshooting customer support and taking in community feedback to make improvements towards the app.\n\n### Technical Specification\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n![image (1).jpeg](ipfs://bafkreidjcji7dynsdysppuwbi65a5wbe6avhsyeki3pmzfbad66zvnmnju)\n    \n- **Delegate discovery page**\n    - Sorting — enable sorting by: most voting power, most delegators, most active, random\n    - Filters — enable filters by: Issues, Stakeholders (out of scope for v1, but for v2, we’d love to look at integrating other credentials)\n- **Delegation interface** — simple, easy-to-use interface for delegation for anyone. They can also see at any time, who they delegated to and their own voting power and token balances.\n- Delegate’s Page & Statement Creation\n    - Delegate statement creation — simple to use delegate statement creation wizard and profile page for each delegate that connects their wallet.\n    - Governance data feed — delegate’s statement data will be open-sourced and streamed and accessible publicly for anyone else to build on top of. *Committed to making all delegate data available and via a shared open-data standard.*\n- **Lyra customization**\n    - Lyra specific subdomain — While we will host the site and be responsible for all of the costs of hosting and maintenance (guaranteed for 12 months), we enable the site to live on Lyra’s custom sub-domain of choosing rather than our own. E.g. [gov.lyra.finance](http://gov.lyra.finance)\n    - Lyra white-labeled design — on the landing page as well as delegate’s default avatars.\n\n**Timeline:** after the proposal passes, we aim to launch the v1 of Lyra Agora in 4-6 weeks.\n\n## Rationale\n\n- Dedicated governance portal — Trust and ease of use is a key factor when it comes to increasing governance participation from the community. To combat voter apathy, we believe a tailored client will reduce barriers of entry. This way we can link out to Lyra’s FAQ, show Lyra specific metrics, etc.\n- Subdomain — we believe enabling Agora to live natively on the DAO’s page accomplish 2 things: (1) increase ease of use for users and (2) risk mitigation in case that the DAO wishes to replace Agora in the future. They can do this without interrupting user’s experience with a new domain of any sort.\n- Backend indexer — we believe speed and reliability is important as critical governance decisions often happen in a short span of time. As a result, we’ve chosen to deploy a custom indexer for each DAO. An alternative solution could’ve been The Graph.\n- Wallet compatibilities — to reduce testing complexity, we’re primarily testing with the popular EOAs like Metamask, Coinbase Wallet and Taho. We also support eth gnosis safe multi-sigs. For the v1 of Agora, we will not be immediately compatible with custom deployed wallets or ERC-1271.\n\n### Test Cases\n\nWe have a launch checklist to make sure all the features work and are stress tested. However, the primary features are listed above.\n\n### Configurable Values\n\nN/A\n\n## Copyright\n\nCopyright and related rights waived via CC0.\n\nLyra Agora will be licensed under MIT.",

      "title": "Rewards - Add Promotional Partner Referral Tier",
      "content": "# Simple Summary\n\nThe purpose of this rewards proposal is to create another tier in the referral scheme outlined in LEAP-49 for promotional partners.\n\n# Abstract\n\nReferrals can be an effective growth strategy for DAOs that lack access to more conventional methods of product distribution. To further enhance this approach, I propose introducing a new verified tier exclusively for promotional partner referrers. This will help us to better target prominent Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) and communities, thereby increasing our chances of attracting larger audiences.\n\n# Motivation\n\nThe current referral tier structure consists of four levels, each necessitating a specific amount of LYRA to be staked and an application submitted to the grantsDAO for verification. Although effective in assessing the alignment of potential referral partners that have expressed interest in being verified, requiring promotional partners outside of the community to stake over 1 million LYRA for a 50% reward kickback is a significant demand. Therefore, it is essential to develop a more appealing alternative tier tailored to promotional partners whose communities could be valuable sources of new users for the Lyra Protocol.\n\nBelow are the current referral tiers outlined in LEAP-49.\n\n| Tier | Conditions | Fee Rewards for Referee | Multiplier for Referred Trader  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| I | 0 stkLYRA, unverified | 10% | 1.2x |\n| II | 500k stkLYRA, verified | 35% | 1.2x |\n| III | 1m stkLYRA, verified | 50% | 1.2x |\n| IV | 5m stkLYRA, verified | 60% | 1.2x |\n\n# Specification\n\nBelow is the desired additional tier (II) to offer promotional partners. With the addition of this new tier, the current tier II specified in LEAP-49 would become tier III and so on. \n\n| Tier | Conditions | Fee Rewards for Referee | Multiplier for Referred Trader  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| I | 0 stkLYRA, unverified | 10% | 1.1x |\n| II | 0 stkLYRA, verified | 20% | 1.2x |\n| III | 500k stkLYRA, verified | 35% | 1.2x |\n| IV | 1m stkLYRA, verified | 50% | 1.2x |\n| V | 5m stkLYRA, verified | 60% | 1.2x |\n\n# Rationale\n\nTo emphasize the objective of this new tier, it aims to attract KOLs and communities that might not otherwise consider becoming a Lyra Referrer. By eliminating the need for referrers to stake LYRA, we address the issue of demanding financial investment before delivering value in the form of referral fee rewards, which is not enticing and could lead to unsuccessful outreach.\n\nPromotional referral partners would be eligible for a 20% fee reward from referred traders, below that of Tier III, maintaining the incentive for the most dedicated referrers to stake LYRA for an additional kickback. Furthermore, the promotional partner can offer a 1.2x reward boost for traders onboarded to Lyra through their platform. This unique offering incentivizes their audience to participate.\n\nIn summary, this tier is designed to minimize the promotional partner’s effort while providing tangible benefits for their community. By introducing this tier, we can create a more appealing proposition for valuable referrers.\n\n# Test Cases\n\nNIL\n\n# Copyright Waiver\n\nAll LEAPs must be in the public domain.
