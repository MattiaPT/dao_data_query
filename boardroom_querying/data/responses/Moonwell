      "title": "MIP-X05: Reduce Safety Module Cooldown to 7 Days and Add Voting Requirement to Claim Rewards",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to bolster Moonwell's security posture through increased\ngovernance participation and optimize the\n[Moonwell Safety Module](https://docs.moonwell.fi/moonwell/moonwell-overview/stake#overview)\nmechanics through two key changes:\n\n1. Implementing a requirement that users must vote at least once in the last 30\n   days to claim staking rewards\n2. Reducing the unstaking cooldown period from 10 days to 7 days across\n   supported networks\n\nThis proposal represents a foundational first step in increasing governance\nparticipation and improving Moonwell's Safety Module, with potential for\nadditional enhancements based on community feedback and effectiveness.\n\n## Motivation\n\nRecent events in DeFi have highlighted the critical importance of active\ngovernance participation in preventing governance attacks and hostile takeovers.\nSpecifically, this summer's\n[governance attack on the Compound DAO](https://cointelegraph.com/news/key-takeaways-golden-boys-attack-compound-dao)\nwhere a group known as the \"Golden Boys\" successfully passed a controversial\nproposal during a period of low voting participation serves as a stark reminder\nof the risks of governance inactivity.\n\nFollowing extensive community discussion on the\n[Moonwell Governance Forum](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/increasing-governance-participation/1275),\nthis proposal implements two of the discussed changes while laying groundwork\nfor potential future enhancements. The community has suggested various\nadditional improvements that could be considered after evaluating the impact of\nthese initial changes, including but not limited to:\n\n- Additional reward multipliers for consistent voters\n- Further cooldown period optimizations\n- Delegating stkWELL voting power to third party delegates to vote on a\n  community member's behalf\n- Additional governance participation incentives\n\n## Specification\n\n### Technical Implementation\n\nThe proposal will execute the following changes:\n\n1. On Optimism:\n\n   - Call `setCoolDownSeconds` on stkWELL contract\n     (0xfB26A4947A38cb53e2D083c6490060CCCE7438c5)\n   - New value: 604800 (7 days in seconds)\n\n2. On Base:\n\n   - Call `setCoolDownSeconds` on stkWELL contract\n     (0xe66e3a37c3274ac24fe8590f7d84a2427194dc17)\n   - New value: 604800 (7 days in seconds)\n\n3. Frontend Implementation:\n   - Add checks for voting history before enabling reward claims\n   - Implement UI feedback for users who need to vote before claiming\n\nNote: The Safety Module on Moonbeam will require a contract upgrade to update\nthe Cooldown Period and development is currently in progress. This contract\nupgrade, like all deployed code on Moonwell, will be thoroughly audited by\nHalborn Security and we aim to propose this change separately once the audit has\nbeen completed in the coming weeks.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\nBased on community discussion, we've addressed key questions:\n\n1. **Can users still stake/unstake without voting?**\n   - Staking functions remain unrestricted\n   - Unstaking is subject only to the standard cooldown period:\n     - 7 days on Base and Optimism\n     - 10 days on Moonbeam (until separate upgrade)\n   - Voting status has no impact on staking or unstaking capabilities\n2. **What happens to unclaimed rewards if a user hasn't voted?**\n\n   - Rewards continue to accrue regardless of voting status\n   - Users can claim after voting on any active onchain proposal\n   - No rewards are lost; they're simply held until you participate in an\n     onchain vote\n\n3. **How will users know when to vote?**\n\n   - Proposals are announced on\n     [@MoonwellGov X/Twitter](https://x.com/MoonwellGov)\n   - Proposal announcements are also posted in\n     [Discord](https://discord.gg/moonwellfi) and\n     [Telegram](https://t.me/moonwellfi) announcements channels\n   - Boardroom provides regular governance updates on the Moonwell Governance\n     Forum\n   - Active proposals are surfaced on the Discovery and Governance pages in the\n     [Moonwell app](https://moonwell.fi).\n   - WELL stakers attempting to claim rewards will be linked to active proposals\n     when attempting to claim rewards from the\n     [staking page](https://moonwell.fi/stake/base) of the Moonwell app.\n\n4. **Will voting \"abstain\" allow me to claim Safety Module staking rewards**\n   - Yes, any tallied vote within the past 30 days, whether it be Aye, Nay, and\n     Abstain, will allow for you to claim your Safety Module staking rewards.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- Voting Period: 3 days\n- Implementation:\n  - Immediate upon successful execution of MIP-X05 for Optimism and Base\n    networks\n  - Moonbeam implementation to follow in 1-2 weeks after Safety Module contract\n    uplift, successful audit, and passage of separate governance vote\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n- Gas costs for voting on Base will be sponsored through Coinbase Smart Wallet\n- Future proposals may build upon this foundation based on community feedback\n  and observed effectiveness\n\n## Voting Options\n\n- **For (Aye)**: Vote in favor of implementing the reduced cooldown period and\n  voting requirement for reward claims\n- **Against (Nay)**: Vote against implementing these changes, maintaining\n  current cooldown period and reward claim mechanics\n- **Abstain**: Participate in voting while remaining neutral on the proposal\n",

      "content": "## Summary\nThis multi-network proposal seeks to onboard [Wrapped rsETH (wrsETH)](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp), a liquid restaking token from [KelpDAO](https://kelpdao.xyz), as a new collateral asset on Moonwell's deployments on Base and Optimism.\n\nwrsETH is a wrapped version of KelpDAO's restaked ETH (rsETH), designed to offer liquidity and DeFi utility for restaked ETH within KelpDAO's platform. Restakers mint rsETH by staking their liquid staking tokens (LSTs), and wrsETH enables those tokens to be used in other DeFi apps while still earning restaking rewards. The integration of wrsETH into Moonwell's ecosystem will create new opportunities for users to earn Kelp Miles and EigenLayer points while supplying or borrowing against wrsETH.\n\nFor additional details on wrsETH and Gauntlet's full risk analysis, please refer to the forum post [here](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/add-wrseth-market-to-moonwell-on-base-optimism/1144).\n\n## Gauntlet's Initial Risk Parameters\n\n| **Parameter**         | **Base**                       | **Optimism**                  |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| **Collateral Factor**  | 74%                            | 74%                           |\n| **Supply Cap**         | 1075 wrsETH                    | 400 wrsETH                    |\n| **Borrow Cap**         | 430 wrsETH                     | 160 wrsETH                    |\n| **Protocol Seize Share**| 3%                            | 3%                            |\n| **Reserve Factor**     | 0.15                           | 0.15                          |\n| **Interest Rate Model**|                                |                               |\n| **Base Rate**          | 0%                             | 0%                            |\n| **Kink**               | 35%                            | 35%                           |\n| **Multiplier**         | 15%                            | 15%                           |\n| **Jump Multiplier**    | 450%                           | 450%                          |\n\n### Token Addresses\n- **Base**: [0xEDfa23602D0EC14714057867A78d01e94176BEA0](https://basescan.org/token/0xEDfa23602D0EC14714057867A78d01e94176BEA0)\n- **Optimism**: [0x87eEE96D50Fb761AD85B1c982d28A042169d61b1](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x87eEE96D50Fb761AD85B1c982d28A042169d61b1)\n\n### Oracle Addresses\n- **Base**:\n  - [RSETH/ETH](https://basescan.org/address/0xd7221b10FBBC1e1ba95Fd0B4D031C15f7F365296)\n- **Optimism**:\n  - [RSETH/ETH](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x03fe94a215E3842deD931769F913d93FF33d0051)\n\n## Voting Options\n\n- **Aye**: Approve the proposal to onboard Wrapped rsETH on both Base and Optimism with Gauntlet's specified initial risk parameters.\n- **Nay**: Reject the proposal.\n- **Abstain**: Abstain from voting on this proposal.\n",

Gauntlet will also be assigned as the USDC Emissions Admin to dynamically manage these rewards without requiring further governance proposals. For this initial period, 50,000 USDC will be transferred to the [MultiRewardDistributor](https://basescan.org/address/0xe9005b078701e2A0948D2EaC43010D35870Ad9d2) contract, and the execution of this proposal will initiate rewards, setting speeds equally across both supply and borrow.\n\n## Proposal Actions\nThe following actions will be executed as part of this proposal:\n\n1. **Update Admin Role**\n   Call `_updateOwner` on the MultiRewardDistributor, specifically for the USDC market:\n   - **mToken**: 0xEdc817A28E8B93B03976FBd4a3dDBc9f7D176c22 (Moonwell USDC)\n   - **emissionToken**: 0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913 (USDC)\n   - **newOwner**: 0x5a4E19842e09000a582c20A4f524C26Fb48Dd4D0 (Gauntlet)\n\n2. **Update Supply Speed**\n   Call `_updateSupplySpeed` on the MultiRewardDistributor for the USDC market:\n   - **newSupplySpeed**: 13,778\n\n3. **Update Borrow Speed**\n   Call `_updateBorrowSpeed` on the MultiRewardDistributor for the USDC market:\n   - **newBorrowSpeed**: 13,778\n\n4. **Update Emissions End Time**\n   Call `_updateEndTime` on the MultiRewardDistributor for the USDC market:\n   - **newEndTime**: 1731081600 (Friday, November 8, 2024, 16:00 GMT)\n\n## Rationale\n- **USDC Incentives**: This proposal will initiate USDC rewards for the USDC market on Base by setting the reward speeds for both suppliers and borrowers. These incentives are aimed at boosting liquidity and usage of the USDC market on Moonwell.\n- **Gauntlet as Emissions Admin**: By assigning Gauntlet control over USDC emissions, the protocol can benefit from their expertise in optimizing incentive distribution dynamically, reducing the need for further governance actions.\n- **Supply and Borrow Speeds**: The reward speeds of 13,778 for both suppliers and borrowers help ensure an equitable distribution of incentives across market participants and should drive increased borrowing demand.\n\n## Voting Options\n- **Aye**: Approve the proposal to assign Gauntlet as emissions admin, update supply and borrow speeds, and set the emissions end time.\n- **Nay**: Reject the proposal and maintain the current emissions structure.\n- **Abstain**: Abstain from voting on this proposal.\n(edited)",

      "title": "[Temp Check] Add Wrapped Super OETH market to Moonwell on Base",
      "content": "### General Information\n\n* Asset Name : Wrapped Super OETH (wsuperOETHb)\n* Address: [0x7FcD174E80f264448ebeE8c88a7C4476AAF58Ea6](https://basescan.org/token/0x7FcD174E80f264448ebeE8c88a7C4476AAF58Ea6)\n* Project & Token Description: \n  * [Super OETH ](https://www.originprotocol.com/super-oeth)(superOETHb) is the next iteration of OETH, a superior LST with an extremely tight 1:1 peg and high yields thanks to a combination of the OETH AMO and DVT direct staking through SSV/P2p. superOETHb yields are able to reach double digit levels, making it an exceptionally perfect token for lending and borrowing against ETH. superOETHb was built reusing 90% of the code from OETH, for which the codebase has already been [audited 12+ times](https://docs.originprotocol.com/security-and-risk/audits). \n  * Super OETH is the first token in a new category of liquid staking: Supercharged LSTs. Supercharged LSTs will have materially higher yield while being designed for L2s, with a similar risk profile to mainnet LSTs. Ethereum liquid staking is amplified with chain-specific, auto-compounded incentives. Deep concentrated liquidity pools guarantee exits with minimal costs - users will never lose ability to convert back to ETH.\n  * wsuperOETHb is a ERC-4626 tokenized vault designed to accrue yield in price rather than in quantity. The wsuperOETHb to superOETHb exchange rate can be read from the [contract](https://basescan.org/token/0x7FcD174E80f264448ebeE8c88a7C4476AAF58Ea6) (function number 16), or via the superOETHb dapp.\n  * Current exchange rate as of 10/3/24: 1 wsuperOETHb = 1.01410462 superOETHb\n\n* Benefits to Moonwell Community: \n  * This new Super OETH market would lead to additional increased TVL for Moonwell, additional revenue to the Moonwell Protocol and DAO from active loans and liquidations, and will attract a wider user base.\n  * We’ve noticed many LSTs trade below their peg due to DEX fees and slippage, and to reflect the time value of money. LSTs that consistently trade below peg effectively impose a hidden exit fee - certain LSTs often trade ~0.25% below peg, meaning it takes three weeks of staking to break even. This may be ok for long-term holders, but is terrible for projects who plan to integrate the LSTs, or for users who plan to loop LTSs for additional yield. This is not the case with OETH, and it will not be the case with Super OETH.\n  * Using Super OETH on Moonwell will produce significantly higher yield than the other supported LSTs and will have a near perfect ETH peg. Utilizing a concentrated Aerodrome liquidity pool with the tightest tick possible helps make Super OETH the most pegged L2 LST currently available, while being able to reach double digit yields.\n  * Super OETH has a native yield of 15.10% APY - at the current ETH borrow rate on Moonwell Base of 0.7%, one loop at 75% LTV would now yield you 25.90% APY. After 5 loops that number jumps to 48.05%, or 50.79% when including the WELL emissions. These figures are not possible with the LSTs and LRTs currently supported on Moonwell. Our vision for Super OETH is for it to become both the most trusted LST, and also the most lucrative for those seeking to use an LST for leveraged staking.\n\n### Performance\n\n- Super OETH has seen incredible growth since launch, growing from $7m to over $300m over the last few weeks. Super OETH has reached the number one spot by TVL on Defillama for yield projects on Base and accounts for a large amount of the Aerodrome Slipstream TVL.\n\n### Market Risk Assessment\n\n* Market cap of the token: $322m (138k ETH)\n* Total supply: 138k superOETHb\n* The largest CEX/DEX\n  * Super OETH is listed on 3 Aerodrome markets\n- Emission schedule: No set emission schedule\n\n### Decentralization\n\n- List the top token holders: \n- Largest contracts:\n  - 0x6446021f4e396da3df4235c62537431372195d38- Aerodrome deposit contract\n  - 0x6fb655476fdcfb9712dd200308d941a1c6d1119e- 2nd Aerodrome deposit contract\n  - 0x7FcD174E80f264448ebeE8c88a7C4476AAF58Ea6- wsuperOETHb contract\n- List all of the privileged roles in the token contract: Certain functions can be called by Origin Guardians - Guardians use a 2 of 8 multisig with limited powers that can be found in the [governance section](https://docs.originprotocol.com/ogn/governance#guardians) of the superOETHb docs. All other necessary protocol powers require 5 of 8 signatures.\n- Is the token pausable?: Yes\n- Does the token have a blacklist?: No\n\n### Smart Contract Risks\n\n- Provide Basescan links with verified contracts: \n  - Super OETH Contract: 0xDBFeFD2e8460a6Ee4955A68582F85708BAEA60A3\n  - Wrapped Super OETH Contract: 0x7FcD174E80f264448ebeE8c88a7C4476AAF58Ea6\n- Give the age of the token in days: 60 days\n- Provide the number of transactions in the contract to date: there are 17,000+\n\n### Security Posture\n- What audits, if any, were performed?   \n  * superOETHb and wsuperOETHb were built reusing 90% of the OETH code, which was built reusing 95% of the OUSD code, of which many audits have been done since 2020. All OETH audits can be found in the [audits section](https://docs.originprotocol.com/security-and-risk/audits) of the OETH docs. We have recently retained [yAudit](https://yaudit.dev/) to look at our PRs as we code, and OpenZeppelin is also held on retainer to review 100% of the OETH and OUSD smart contract changes.\n-  Does the project have an active bug bounty program?  \n   * Origin maintains an active bug bounty with rewards ranging in size from $100 OUSD for minor issues to $1,000,000 OUSD for major critical vulnerabilities. The bug bounty program is currently administered by [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/origindefi/), where Origin maintains a median resolution time of 6 hours.\n- Provide emergency contacts with their estimated response time/availability\n  * The Origin team is available 24 hours a day via [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/ogn). On March 10 2023 when USDC depegged from the dollar (and therefore from OUSD), it took the Guardians/Origin engineers about 4 minutes to notice, and 16 minutes to start the process of moving the funds to a safer strategy. superOETHb and wsuperOETHb will have no exposure to stablecoins nor any other pegged asset aside from WETH. \n  * Please also contact the Origin support team directly if there are any issues and someone from the Origin team will respond promptly: support@originprotocol.com \n- List additional security and formal verification tools used in the development\n   * We mostly manually verify deployments before the multisig tx is created. We use Sol2uml to verify deployed contracts. We also have Slither as part of our CI. We also have some scripts in our repo that we use as needed.\n* List all monitoring services used by the token, if any.\n   * We use an in-house solution based on Subsquid as our indexer and Grafana. We also add custom alerts on Tenderly for critical events.\n\n### Upgradability\n\n- Is it upgradeable?: Yes, superOETHb is upgradable.\n- Who is authorized to make an upgrade? Can an upgrade happen instantaneously or is there a time-lock delay?\n  - All Super OETH contracts are owned by the Timelock contract. All upgrades will have to go through Timelock. The Timelock is controlled by the 5 of 8 multisig mentioned above. Signers are trusted contributors who are actively involved in the day-to-day management of the protocol and all have a vested interest in helping the protocol succeed.  The initial timelock was set to 60 seconds to allow the protocol to ramp up quickly, but it has been increased to 48 hours. \n - Which components are upgradeable?: The whole token contract can be upgraded.\n - How does the upgradeability design work? Who manages it and how are upgrades performed?: All Super OETH contracts are owned by the Timelock contract. All upgrades will have to go through Timelock. The timelock is controlled by the 5 of 8 multisig mentioned above.\n - Does it emit an event when the implementation is updated? \n   - Yes, `Upgraded(address indexed implementation)`\n\n### Oracle Assessment\n- Please view the discussion post for more information on the oracle\n\n- How is the asset wrapped, staked, or otherwise created?\n  - superOETHb can be minted from the contract, dapp, or swapped into from one of the above Aerodrome pools. Wrapped superOETHb can be created at any time using the 4626 contract, or the superOETHb dapp. \n - On what network does the underlying asset exist?: The underlying asset exists on Base, with a portion of the yield coming from mainnet beacon chain staking.\n - How can you verify that the amount of the asset that is minted is never more than the amount of the underlying asset that is locked, staked, or used as collateral?\n   - The only way that users can obtain superOETHb is by first providing the protocol ETH or WETH. Additional superOETHb may be minted by the protocol [AMO](https://docs.originprotocol.com/introduction/core-concepts/amo), but these tokens are owned by Origin Protocol and only ever enter circulation when someone provides ETH to the Aerodrome pool.\n- Is there a way to verify proof of reserves (PoR) on the same network as the market?\n  - The protocol mainly holds WETH in the Vault, Aerodrome pool and Bridged wOETH. \n  - The bridged wOETH holds ETH on the mainent in the validators. The Vault holds WETH until it deposits it somewhere. The Aerodrome pool has WETH as part of its liquidity.\n- What specific events might cause the price to “depeg” or no longer be the same as the price of the underlying asset?\n  - If more circulating superOETHb was supplied to the Aerodrome pool than the amount of ETH in the pool, a depeg could theoretically occur. This is mitigated by the question above.\n  - OETH validator slashing may cause a depeg. However, the size of the slash will likely be smaller than the underlying superOETHb yield, so in this case the yield for superOETHb will temporarily be smaller.\n\nPlease see the forum discussion for more detail on this proposal",

      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nWe propose adding support for EURC reward streams on Moonwell's Base deployment,\nenabling [EURC Core market](https://moonwell.fi/markets/supply/base/eurc)\nsuppliers and borrowers to receive EURC rewards.\n\n## Details\n\nCurrently, Moonwell's deployment on Base supports both WELL and USDC reward\nstreams across its Core markets. Moonwell utilizes a\n[MultiRewardDistributor contract](https://basescan.org/address/0xe9005b078701e2A0948D2EaC43010D35870Ad9d2)\nwhich allows for additional reward streams to be added through governance,\nenabling support for new reward tokens. With this proposal, like with\n[MIP-B07](https://moonwell.fi/governance/proposal/moonbeam?id=55) which added\nsupport for USDC reward streams, we aim to introduce EURC reward streams to the\nprotocol.\n\nEURC reward streams will provide both suppliers and borrowers in the EURC core\nmarket with EURC-denominated rewards. The initial configuration will allocate\nemissions as follows:\n\n| Market | EURC (Supply)       | EURC (Borrow)       |\n| ------ | ------------------- | ------------------- |\n| EURC   | 0.004538 per second | 0.003025 per second |\n\nIn total, **25,000 EURC will be distributed over 38 days and 6 hours (38.25\ndays)**, split between supply and borrow incentives. The emissions per second\nare designed to distribute rewards consistently throughout this period.\n\n**Start Time**: `September 23, 2024, 21:30:00 UTC`  \n**End Time**: `November 1, 2024, 03:30:00 UTC`\n\n## Voting Options\n\n- **Yay**: I support adding EURC reward streams to Moonwell's Base deployment.\n- **Nay**: I oppose adding EURC reward streams to Moonwell's Base deployment.\n- **Abstain**: I decline to vote either for or against this proposal.\n",

      "title": "MIP-B30: Accept Ownership of EURC Flagship Vault and Update Performance Fees",
      "content": "**Author(s):** Block Analitica and B.Protocol **Related Discussions:**\n[Moonwell MetaMorpho Vaults - Next Gen DeFi Lending](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/introducing-moonwell-metamorpho-vaults-next-gen-defi-lending/960/16)  \n**Submission Date:** September 10, 2024\n\n## Proposal Summary\n\nAfter the established collaboration between the Moonwell DAO, Morpho DAO, Block\nAnalitica, and B.Protocol to\n[deploy, manage, and incentivize Moonwell Flagship ETH and USDC Morpho Vaults](https://moonwell.fi/governance/proposal/moonbeam?id=100),\nthis proposal seeks to expand vault listings by creating a new Flagship Vault on\nBase that would accept\n[EURC](https://basescan.org/address/0x60a3e35cc302bfa44cb288bc5a4f316fdb1adb42).\nWith this initiative, we aim to attract new capital and activity to the Moonwell\necosystem, targeting EUR-based stablecoin users seeking risk-adjusted yield. The\nnew EURC vault is proposed with the same role assignments as the ones present\nfor existing USDC and ETH Flagship vaults. A 15% performance fee will be\nimplemented, with the Moonwell DAO's share being directed to Moonwell's EURC\nCore Market protocol reserves.\n\nThis MIP proposes:\n\n1. Accepting ownership of a new EURC Flagship Vault, expanding Moonwell's Morpho\n   vault offerings on Base.\n2. Updating performance fees for existing ETH and USDC Flagship Vaults from 10%\n   to 15%.\n\n## Background and Rationale\n\nBuilding on the successful collaboration between the Moonwell DAO, Block\nAnalitica, B.Protocol, and Morpho DAO, this proposal seeks to attract new\ncapital and EUR-based stablecoin users seeking risk-adjusted yield. Our\n[existing vaults](https://moonwell.fi/vaults) have already attracted ~$38m TVL,\nrepresenting over 55% of total supply on Morpho (Base) at the time of writing.\nThe addition of an EURC Flagship Vault creates yield opportunities for EUR-based\nstablecoin users, potentially attracting substantial new capital and users to\nthe Moonwell ecosystem.\n\n## Vault Configuration and Roles\n\nThe EURC Flagship Vault will be configured as follows:\n\n- **Owner:** Moonwell DAO (via the Moonwell Temporal Governor contract)\n- **Curator:** Block Analitica & B.Protocol\n- **Allocator:** Public allocator contract and Risk Manager Multisig\n- **Guardian:** Moonwell Security Council\n- **Timelock period:** 4 days\n- **Vault name:** Moonwell Flagship EURC\n- **Symbol:** mwEURC\n\n## Performance Fee and Incentives\n\nThis proposal seeks to implement a **15% performance fee** for the new EURC\nFlagship Vault, to be split between Block Analitica/B.Protocol and the Moonwell\nDAO. The Moonwell DAO's portion will be added to Moonwell's EURC Core Market\nprotocol reserves.\n\nThis MIP will also adjust performance fees for existing ETH and USDC Flagship\nVaults from 10% to 15%.\n\n### Impact of Performance Fee Updates\n\nThe proposed increase in performance fees is expected to have a minimal impact\non user rates:\n\n- USDC vault: Approximately 0.06% drop in current rates\n- ETH vault: Approximately 0.04% drop in current rates\n\nThese adjustments align the fee structure across all Moonwell Flagship Vaults\nand are expected to enhance protocol revenue without significantly affecting\nuser yields.\n\n### Liquidity Incentives\n\nWhile an additional WELL token grant is not being proposed for the EURC Vault,\nthe Morpho DAO will be able allocate a portion of the existing 50m WELL grant\nfor the USDC and ETH Flagship Vaults to incentivize and support the new EURC\nFlagship Vault.\n\n## Implementation\n\nIf this proposal passes, the following onchain actions will be executed:\n\n1. Moonwell DAO will accept ownership of the Moonwell Flagship EURC Vault.\n2. Performance fees for the ETH and USDC vaults will be updated to 15%.\n\n## Voting Options\n\n- **For:** Accept ownership of Moonwell Flagship EURC Morpho vault and proposed\n  markets, and update performance fees as described.\n- **Against:** Reject ownership of Moonwell Flagship EURC Morpho vault and\n  proposed markets, and maintain current performance fee structure.\n- **Abstain**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe addition of an EURC Flagship Vault represents a strategic expansion of\nMoonwell's offerings on Base. By leveraging Morpho infrastructure and the risk\nmanagement expertise of Block Analitica and B Protocol, we aim to replicate the\nsuccess of our existing vaults and tap into the growing demand for\neuro-denominated DeFi opportunities.\n\nUpdating the performance fees across all Flagship Vaults will also harmonize our\nfee structure and potentially increase protocol revenue, with minimal impact on\nuser yields.\n\nApproving this proposal will diversify vault offerings, attract new users, and\nreinforce our Moonwell's position as a leading DeFi app on Base.\n",

      "title": "MIP-B29: Add EURC Market on Base",
      "content": "## Proposal Details\n\nI propose the activation of an EURC (Circle's Euro-Backed Stablecoin) market to\nMoonwell's Base deployment, positioning Moonwell as an early adopter of this\nsignificant asset. This strategic move would align Moonwell with Base's vision\nof becoming a major hub for onchain finance and expand the protocol's stablecoin\nofferings to include both US dollar and euro-backed assets.\n\nNote from Gauntlet: We propose onboarding EURC on Moonwell's Base deployment due\nto its status as a fully-backed, euro-pegged stablecoin issued by Circle, in\ncompliance with MiCA. We believe this will contribute to a more diverse\nstablecoin market and offer new opportunities for liquidity growth.\n\n**Asset:** EURC  \n**Address:**\n[0x60a3E35Cc302bFA44Cb288Bc5a4F316Fdb1adb42](https://basescan.org/address/0x60a3e35cc302bfa44cb288bc5a4f316fdb1adb42)\n**Oracle Feed:**\n[EUR/USD](https://basescan.org/address/0xdae398520e2b67cd3f27aef9cf14d93d927f8250)\n\n## EURC Overview\n\nEURC is Circle's Euro-backed stablecoin, one of the first mainstream euro-pegged\nstablecoins to be released. Alongside USDC, EURC is part of Circle's effort to\nprovide reliable and compliant stablecoin solutions across multiple ecosystems,\nincluding Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, and Stellar. It is redeemable 1:1 for\neuros and can be used for cross-border payments, making it an attractive option\nfor global financial operations.\n\n## Benefits to the Moonwell Community\n\n- **Early Adoption Advantage:** By supporting EURC early in its life cycle,\n  Moonwell positions itself as a leader in offering euro-denominated onchain\n  lending and borrowing.\n- **Market Diversification:** Expands the range of stablecoins offered on\n  Moonwell, allowing users to access euro-denominated liquidity.\n- **Increased TVL and Revenue Potential:** The addition of EURC opens up\n  opportunities for liquidity growth and borrowing demand, which can drive\n  increased protocol revenues.\n- **Strategic Alignment:** Supports Base's vision of becoming a hub for onchain\n  finance and enhances Moonwell's integration with Circle's growing suite of\n  stablecoins.\n\n## Gauntlet Risk Parameter Recommendations\n\nGauntlet, Moonwell's lead risk manager, has provided the following initial risk\nparameter recommendations for the EURC market.\n\nPlease note that Gauntlet serves as Cap Guardian for Moonwell, which allows for\nthe dynamic adjustment of the supply and borrow caps as market demand increases,\nwithout requiring additional onchain governance proposals.\n\n### Risk Parameter Recommendations\n\n| **Parameter**          | **Value** |\n| ---------------------- | --------- |\n| Collateral Factor (CF) | 83%       |\n| Supply Cap             | 4.2M EURC |\n| Borrow Cap             | 3.9M EURC |\n| Protocol Seize Share   | 3%        |\n| Reserve Factor         | 10%       |\n\n### Interest Rate Model Recommendations\n\n| **IR Parameter** | **Recommended Value** |\n| ---------------- | --------------------- |\n| Base Rate        | 0                     |\n| Kink             | 0.9                   |\n| Multiplier       | 0.056                 |\n| Jump Multiplier  | 9                     |\n\n### Supporting Data\n\n- Primary liquidity source: [Aerodrome](https://aerodrome.finance), with over\n  $8M TVL in EURC-USDC pools\n- Recommended supply cap: 4.2M EURC (40% of circulating supply)\n- Recommended borrow cap: 3.9M EURC\n- EURC Interest Rate Curves: Aligned with those of USDC\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAdding EURC to Moonwell on Base represents a strategic step forward in\ndiversifying our stablecoin markets and solidifying our position in the evolving\nonchain financial landscape. By introducing euro-denominated lending and\nborrowing, we not only expand our protocol offerings but also open doors to a\nbroader user base, potentially driving significant growth in both TVL and\nprotocol revenue.\n\nThis move aligns perfectly with Base's vision of globally accessible onchain\nfinance, positioning Moonwell as an early leader in euro-denominated DeFi. Our\nearly adoption of EURC demonstrates Moonwell's commitment to innovation and our\nreadiness to support the next wave of stablecoin developments in the Base\necosystem. By approving this proposal, we take a decisive step towards enhancing\nMoonwell's global appeal, diversifying our liquidity sources, and strengthening\nour alignment with both Circle and Base.\n\nThis addition not only benefits our existing community but also paves the way\nfor Moonwell's continued growth and relevance in the rapidly growing onchain\neconomy.\n\n## Voting Options\n\n- **Aye:** Approve the addition of EURC as a new market on Moonwell's Base\n  deployment\n- **Nay:**Reject the addition of EURC as a new market on Moonwell's Base\n  deployment\n- **Abstain:** Choose to abstain from voting on this proposal\n",

      "content": "## Proposal Details\n\nI propose the addition of a\n[cbBTC](https://x.com/coinbase/status/1823501582006411614) (Coinbase wrapped\nBTC) market to Moonwell's Base deployment. This proposal aims to initiate the\nprocess of listing cbBTC, allowing the Moonwell community and risk managers like\nGauntlet to prepare for its imminent launch. By positioning Moonwell as an early\nadopter of this significant asset, we align ourselves with Base's vision of\nbecoming a major hub for Bitcoin DeFi and further catalyzing the growth of the\nworld's largest onchain economy.\n\n**Note from Gauntlet:** We propose onboarding cbBTC as collateral on Moonwell\nBase deployment conditional to significant liquidity being added on DEXes. Due\nto the market demand and future growth of cbBTC liquidity on Base we think it\nappropriate to list the asset.\n\n- Asset: cbBTC\n- Address:\n  [0xcbB7C0000aB88B473b1f5aFd9ef808440eed33Bf](https://basescan.org/address/0xcbb7c0000ab88b473b1f5afd9ef808440eed33bf)\n- Oracle Feed:\n  [BTC/USD](https://basescan.org/address/0x64c911996D3c6aC71f9b455B1E8E7266BcbD848F)\n\n### cbBTC\n\n- cbBTC is an upcoming wrapped Bitcoin derivative expected to launch on the Base\n  network very soon.\n- It aims to become the dominant Bitcoin variant on Base, replacing WBTC as the\n  trusted solution for Bitcoin DeFi following the announcement of WBTC custodian\n  [BitGo’s new ownership structure](https://protos.com/justin-sun-has-99-problems-and-wbtc-is-two-of-them/).\n- Jesse Pollak, creator of Base, has emphasized his desire\n  [to build a massive Bitcoin economy](https://x.com/jessepollak/status/1823515062658830681)\n  on the network.\n\n### Benefits to the Moonwell Community\n\n1. Early Adoption Advantage: Position Moonwell as a leader in supporting\n   Coinbase's onchain initiatives and work to build substantial liquidity for\n   cbBTC early in the asset’s life cycle.\n2. Market Diversification: Expand Moonwell's offerings, introducing the first\n   Bitcoin-based lending market on Moonwell’s Base deployment.\n3. Increased TVL and Revenue Potential: Leverage the popularity of Bitcoin\n   collateralization, as evidenced by WBTC's performance on Moonbeam, which is\n   the largest Moonwell market by TVL on the network.\n4. Strategic Alignment: Support Base's vision of becoming a hub for Bitcoin DeFi\n   and further building out of the onchain economy.\n\n### Gauntlet Risk Parameter Recommendations\n\nGauntlet, Moonwell's lead risk manager, has provided the following initial risk\nparameter recommendations for the cbBTC market.\n\nPlease note that Gauntlet serves as Cap Guardian for Moonwell. This means that\nas DEX liquidity for cbBTC grows, Gauntlet will be able to dynamically adjust\nthe supply and borrow caps without requiring additional onchain governance\nproposals.\n\n#### Risk Parameter Recommendations\n\n| Parameter            | Value                                             |\n| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| Collateral Factor    | 81%                                               |\n| Supply Cap           | 0.001 (Will increase as DEX liquidity increases)  |\n| Borrow Cap           | 0.0005 (Will increase as DEX liquidity increases) |\n| Protocol Seize Share | 30%                                               |\n\n#### Interest Rate Model Recommendations\n\n| IR Parameter    | Recommended Value |\n| --------------- | ----------------- |\n| Base            | 0.02              |\n| Kink            | 0.6               |\n| Multiplier      | 0.065             |\n| Jump Multiplier | 3.0               |\n| Reserve Factor  | 0.1               |\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWhile we eagerly await cbBTC's launch on Base, initiating this proposal now is\ncritical to cementing Moonwell's position as a leader in the rapidly evolving\nonchain economy. This proactive approach not only demonstrates our commitment to\ninnovation but also ensures we are fully prepared to integrate cbBTC swiftly and\nsafely once it goes live.\n\nThe addition of cbBTC to Moonwell represents more than just another new\nmarket—it's a strategic move that aligns our community with Base and our\nprotocol with the future of Bitcoin DeFi. By being among the first to support\ncbBTC, we have the opportunity to help shape the landscape of onchain finance\nand further establish Moonwell as a cornerstone of the Base ecosystem.\n\n## Voting Options\n\n- For: Approve the addition of cbBTC as a new market on Moonwell's Base\n  deployment\n- Against: Reject the addition of cbBTC as a new market on Moonwell's Base\n  deployment\n- Abstain\n",

      "title": "MIP-O09 Correcting WELL Rewards Allocation on the VELO Market",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal aims to correct a mistake in the allocation of September's WELL rewards to the VELO market on Optimism. Through the execution of MIP-O07 and MIP-MO08, WELL rewards were mistakenly applied to the old, deprecated v1 VELO market instead of the more recently established VELO v2 market. This proposal seeks to remove the incentives from the deprecated market and reallocate them to the correct VELO v2 market.\n\n## Background\nIn a recent rewards speed adjustment proposal, rewards were intended to be distributed to the newly established VELO v2 market on Optimism. However, due to an oversight, the rewards were mistakenly applied to the deprecated VELO market. The root cause of this issue was the use of an outdated market address (deprecated VELO V1 market) during proposal generation. The branch used for generating the proposal calldata contained the deprecated market address in the file where all the addresses are kept. The commit that changed the market address was in another PR, which had yet to be merged when the proposal went live. This commit has since been merged and this error should not take place again.\n\nThe specific proposals that led to this mistake was **MIP-O07 and MIP-O08 Automated Liquidity Incentive Proposals**. This proposal was divided into two parts due to gas limit constraints on the Moonbeam Network. MIP-O07 was intended to distribute and adjust liquidity incentives for the period beginning 2024-09-06 and ending on 2024-10-04.\n\n## Proposal Details\nThis proposal will:\n1. **Remove WELL Rewards from Deprecated VELO Market:** \n   - Remove the mistakenly allocated WELL supply and borrow rewards from the deprecated VELO market on Optimism.\n   \n2. **Allocate WELL Rewards to the Correct VELO v2 Market:**\n   - Correctly allocate the WELL supply and borrow rewards to the VELO v2 market on Optimism.\n\n3. **Update End Times:** \n   - Ensure that the end times for these rewards align with the originally intended schedule.\n\n## Rationale\nIt is essential to ensure that rewards are distributed accurately and efficiently to maintain user trust and the integrity of the rewards distribution system. Although the amount of WELL rewards mistakenly allocated to the deprecated market is relatively small, reallocating them to the correct market is necessary to avoid any confusion or potential issues.\n\n## Conclusion\nThis proposal is a corrective action to ensure that the WELL rewards are properly allocated to the intended market. By approving this proposal, the community will help maintain the integrity and transparency of the rewards distribution process.\n",

      "title": "[Temp Check] Add EURC on Base ",
      "content": "Hello Moonwell Community,\n\nI’m happy to present the following proposal for a new addition to Moonwell’s Base deployment: EURC, a euro backed stablecoin developed by Circle. The EURC token was recently deployed on Base as of August 1st. As such, I believe it would be beneficial to create an asset listing for it and be one of the first lenders to offer EURC access.\n\n## General\n\nEuro Backed Stable Coin (EURC):\n\nEURC is Circle’s Euro-Backed stablecoin, one of the first mainstream euro stablecoins to be released. EURC is issued by Circle and alongside Circle’s flagship token, USDC. EURC is launching across multiple ecosystems, notability: Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, and Stellar. The euro is one of the most significant fiat currencies in the current traditional financial system. The EURC is regulated and may be redeemed 1:1 for euros. Additionally, the EURC can be used for cross-border payments.\n\nBenefits to the Moonwell Community\n\nListing the EURC stablecoin on Moonwell would be beneficial to the protocol by expanding the range of stablecoin options and enhancing protocol liquidity. Since the stablecoin is backed by the euro and is issued by Circle, it falls within Moonwell’s standards for compliance and security.\n\nResources and Socials\n\n* EURC FAQ Website : https://www.circle.com/en/eurc\n* Docs: https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/docs/eurc-on-main-networks\n* Twitter: https://x.com/Circle\n* Discord: Link is in the original discussion post. \n* LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/circle-internet-financial/\n\nCircle Social Channels Metrics (Size, activity and growth).\n* Twitter Following: 184000 followers\n* Discord Community Size: 12315\n\nProposal Author Info:\n\n* Name: Darren Mims\n* Telegram: Mims0x\n* LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/darren-mims-2ab421206\n* Twitter: https://x.com/0xMims\n* Delegate Address: 0x657D07095b082BB71ebD93F549f407A97f49094F\n* Relationship with Token: I am a Moonwell community member and a delegate with no direct affiliation with Circle Internet Financial or any Circle-affiliated parties.\n\n## Market Risk Assessment\n\nCurrent Market Cap of EURC on Base Mainnet\n\n* EURC market capitalization: [$7M on Base Mainnet](https://eurc.cool/)\n\nMIN/MAX Market capitalization in the last 6 months:\n\n* Minimum (At launch): $0\n* Maximum: [$7M on Base Mainnet](https://eurc.cool/)\n\nTotal supply across all chains:\n\n* Minimum (At launch): $0\n* Maximum: [$41M across all](https://eurc.cool/)\n\nLiquidity on exchanges: Asset currently lacks DEX support on Base.\n\nProof of Assets:\n\nVolatility: [Requesting @Gauntlet's help for this]\n\nAverage Daily Trading Volume: [$485,666.667 since launch](https://dune.com/queries/3906761/6566404)\n\n## Decentralization\n\n* Token Contract: [0x60a3E35Cc302bFA44Cb288Bc5a4F316Fdb1adb42](https://basescan.org/token/0x60a3e35cc302bfa44cb288bc5a4f316fdb1adb42)\n* Privileged Roles in Token Contract:\n  * Admin/Implementation Owner: The admin role has control of the contract, including the ability to upgrade implementation and change the admin address. The admin can transfer to a new address with the ‘changeAdmin’ function. The admin may also upgrade implementation of the proxy contract with ‘upgradeTo’ and ‘upgradeToAndCall’ functions.\n  * Initial Admin Setup: During the deployment of the contract, the deployer is set as the initial admin.\n  * Pauser: The entire FiatToken contract can be frozen in case of a critical issue by the Pauser role.\n  * Owner: The owner (or admin) is defined in the implementation contract and can reassign all other roles.\n  * Blacklister: This role has the privilege of defining what addresses can be blacklisted from transferring/receiving EURC tokens.\n  * MasterMinter: Controls the list of minters and how much each is allowed to mint in EURC. As each minter mints new tokens their minting allowance decreases, after a certain threshold the MasterMinter decides to increase the allowance.\n* Distribution/Top Holders: According to Bubblemaps.io the majority of the token is split between two wallet addresses:\n  * 0x3b5821672af876193bbce324d93b13c3d753d2a8\n  * 0x9066d3cf60d9f7b705026417e8e533b424bc3d48\n* Blacklist Functionality: HAS A BLACKLIST FUNCTION. Like USDC, EURC is issued and redeemed in accordance with Circle’s blacklisting policies.

      "content": "Kelp DAO is seeking community support for adding its Liquid Restaking Token, wrsETH, to Moonwell Markets on Base and Optimism.\n\n### General\n\n* Token Asset Name* -\n  * wrsETH\n\n* A description of the project and the token* -\n  * KelpDAO (https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like restaking rewards, staking rewards, and DeFi yields.\n\n* Latest stats:\n\n  * USD 700 Mn+ (~256k Eth) TVL\n\n  - 50K restakers onboarded\n\n  - Live across Ethereum mainnet and 9 L2s such as Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Scroll, Linea etc.\n\n  - Withdrawals are enabled on Kelp and rsETH holders can unstake rsETH for any of the LSTs and ETH on KelpDAO on Ethereum\n\n  - Bridging of rsETH across L2s is facilitated by infrastructure by LayerZero\n\n  * KelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top-tier audit firms including Sigma Prime, Code4rena, and MixBytes. More about KelpDAO’s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits)\n\n* Benefits to Moonwell Community*\n  * From Moonwell’s perspective, any new asset is a source of additional revenue and expands the ecosystem as a whole. LRTs are a great use case for Moonwell as it is one of the fastest growing ecosystems.\n\n  * With wrsETH being one of the top LRTs, integrating it as a collateral asset will create new demand on Moonwell. This will be beneficial for both Moonwell and Kelp. In addition, wrsETH depositors will accumulate additional Kelp miles and EigenLayer points.\n\n* Use cases for wrsETH market on Moonwell\n\n  * Having wrsETH on Moonwell will allow users to earn Kelp Miles and Eigenlayer points while supplying and borrowing against wrsETH.\n\n* Resources (Website, Social Media Links, and docs)\n  * Website: https://kelpdao.xyz/restake/\n  * Documentation: [Introduction | Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp)\n  * Audits: [Audits | Kelp](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits)\n  * Discord: Please use the link on the forum, unable to add it here\n  * Twitter: [Kelp DAO (@KelpDAO) / X](https://twitter.com/KelpDAO)\n* The proposal author’s contact information\n  * Proposer - Aditya Deorukhkar\n  * Role - DeFi & Partnerships team member, KelpDAO\n  * Email - [aditya@kelpdao.xyz](mailto:aditya@kelpdao.xyz)\n  * Telegram - @Hedged_Adi\n\n**Market Risk Assessment**\n\n* Market cap of the token*\n  * 354 wrsETH on Base - ([Basescan page](https://basescan.org/address/0xEDfa23602D0EC14714057867A78d01e94176BEA0))\n  * 250k+ rsETH on Ethereum Mainnet - ([Etherscan page](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7))\n  * 544 wrsETH on Optimism - ([Optimistic scanner page](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x87eEE96D50Fb761AD85B1c982d28A042169d61b1))\n* Total supply*\n  * 354 wrsETH on Base - ([Basescan page](https://basescan.org/address/0xEDfa23602D0EC14714057867A78d01e94176BEA0))\n  * 247k+ rsETH on Ethereum Mainnet - ([Etherscan page](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7))\n  * 544 wrsETH on Optimism - ([Optimistic scanner page](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x87eEE96D50Fb761AD85B1c982d28A042169d61b1))\n* The largest central and decentralized exchanges where the token is listed and its respective liquidity*\n  * Aerodrome on Base - $2Mn TVL ([0xA24382874A6FD59de45BbccFa160488647514c28](https://basescan.org/address/0xa24382874a6fd59de45bbccfa160488647514c28))\n  * On Ethereum Mainnet -\n    * Total DeFi TVL $50Mn+\n    * Pools on Balancer, Uniswap, Curve and more\n  * Optimism -\n    * Balancer - wrsETH<>WETH pool - [link](https://balancer.fi/pools/optimism/v2/0x73a7fe27fe9545d53924e529acf11f3073841b9e000000000000000000000133)\n    * Velodrome - wrsETH<>WETH pool - [link](https://velodrome.finance/liquidity?query=wrseth)\n* Emission schedule - NA\n\n**Decentralization**\n\n* [List of rsETH Holders on Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA1290d69c65A6Fe4DF752f95823fae25cB99e5A7#balances)\n* [List of wrsETH holders on Base](https://basescan.org/token/0xEDfa23602D0EC14714057867A78d01e94176BEA0#balances)\n* [List of wrsETH holders on Optimism](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x87eEE96D50Fb761AD85B1c982d28A042169d61b1#balances)\n\n**Codebase & On-chain Activity**\n\n* Kelp’s Docs - https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/rseth-smart-contracts\n* wrsETH on Base - https://basescan.org/address/0xEDfa23602D0EC14714057867A78d01e94176BEA0\n  * Age of the token - 4 Months old on Base, 9 months on Ethereum mainnet,\n  * 20K+ Transactions on Base so far with wrsETH\n\n**Security**\n\n* Audits: Kelp’s smart contracts are audited by Sigma Prime, MixBytes, and Code4rena-\n  * Sigma Prime Report: https://kelpdao.xyz/audits/smartcontracts/SigmaPrime.pdf\n  * MixBytes: https://kelpdao.xyz/audits/smartcontracts/mixbytes.pdf\n  * Code4rena: https://code4rena.com/reports/2023-11-kelp\n* Does the project have an active bug bounty program?* - Kelp has partnered with Immunify to create a $250K Bug bounty program - [link](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/kelp-dao/information/)\n* Provide emergency contacts with their estimated response time/availability*\n  * On TG - @saurabhj016, @galacticminter @Hedged_Adi - within an hour\n\n**Oracle Assessment**\n\n* We are working with ChainLink for an Oracle on Base -\n  * RSETH / ETH - 0xd7221b10FBBC1e1ba95Fd0B4D031C15f7F365296\n  * rsETH / ETH Exchange Rate - 0x99DAf760d2CFB770cc17e883dF45454FE421616b\n * On Optimism with ChainLink as well- \n   * RSETH/ETH - 0x03fe94a215E3842deD931769F913d93FF33d0051\n* Yes the asset is a wrapped version of rsETH\n\nAverage Daily Trading Volume:\n\n1. wrsETH on Base - Avg Daily trading volume per day - $8.8K/day (Per day average based on last 7 days - [DeXScreener](https://dexscreener.com/base/0xa24382874a6fd59de45bbccfa160488647514c28))\n2. wrsETH on Optimism - Avg Daily trading volume per day - $20K/day (Per day average based on last 7 days - [DeXScreener](https://dexscreener.com/optimism/0x73a7fe27fe9545d53924e529acf11f3073841b9e))\n\nTop 10 Token Holders: The post does not provide a list of the top 10 token holders, the percentage held by each, and tags if known.\n\n1.

This proposer has doxxed signers from the broader community, not just Kelp.\n\nManager is responsible for changing configurations of contracts. This includes the frequency with which staking happens etc.\n\nOperators are responsible for operations at a smart contract level. This include making calls to auto-compound rewards, stake ETH, process withdrawals etc-\n\n**Pausability**\n\nAll Kelp contracts are pausable by the manager multisig. This is done so the team can respond to emergencies if any. However, it is only the Timelock Proposer that can unpause the contracts. This means that the team can only pause the contracts to prevent any damage etc. The resumption can only happen after the community leaders come together and agree it's safe to resume the protocol. There is no blacklisting mechanism of any sort at Kelp.\n\n**Upgradability**\n\nAs mentioned above, only the timelock contract has the power to upgrade the contracts. The timelock delay is 10 days and the proposer is the community multisig.\n\n**Chainlink Oracle Price Feed**\n\nBase -\n\nRSETH / ETH - [0xd7221b10FBBC1e1ba95Fd0B4D031C15f7F365296](https://basescan.org/address/0xd7221b10FBBC1e1ba95Fd0B4D031C15f7F365296)\n\nrsETH / ETH Exchange Rate - [0x99DAf760d2CFB770cc17e883dF45454FE421616b](https://basescan.org/address/0x99DAf760d2CFB770cc17e883dF45454FE421616b)\n\nOptimism -\n\nRSETH / ETH - [0x03fe94a215E3842deD931769F913d93FF33d0051](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x03fe94a215E3842deD931769F913d93FF33d0051)\n\n**Depeg Events**\n\nThere is no specific exclusive event for depegging.

      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to add weETH (Wrapped eETH) as a new market on Moonwell's\nBase deployment. weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent of eETH, a liquid\nrestaking token from [Ether.fi](https://ether.fi), representing ETH staked on\nthe Beacon Chain.\n\n## Proposal Details\n\nWe propose adding weETH as a new collateral asset on the Moonwell Base\ndeployment with the following details:\n\n- Asset: weETH (Wrapped eETH)\n- Address:\n  [0x04c0599ae5a44757c0af6f9ec3b93da8976c150a](https://basescan.org/address/0x04c0599ae5a44757c0af6f9ec3b93da8976c150a#code)\n- Oracle Feed:\n  [weETH/ETH](https://basescan.org/address/0xFC1415403EbB0c693f9a7844b92aD2Ff24775C65)\n- Oracle Feed:\n  [ETH/USD](https://basescan.org/address/0x71041dddad3595F9CEd3DcCFBe3D1F4b0a16Bb70)\n- Composite Oracle Feed:\n  [weETH/ETH/USD](https://basescan.org/address/0xe44b816FE6bc5047C22b9fA5e4D4c5c9747476b3)\n\n### About weETH and Ether.fi\n\nEther.fi is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on\nEthereum. weETH is the wrapped, non-rebasing version of eETH, which represents\nETH staked on the Beacon Chain and accrues daily staking rewards.\n\nKey points:\n\n- Users can deposit ETH to mint eETH, which can be wrapped into weETH\n- ETH staked through Ether.fi accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards and is\n  natively restaked with EigenLayer\n- The eETH contract has been live since June 2023, with weETH launching in\n  November 2023\n- Approximately 1,814,766.66 ETH is held within the contract\n\n### Benefits to the Moonwell Community\n\n1. Enhanced liquidity for weETH on Base\n2. Users can earn Ether.fi points and Eigenlayer points while supplying and\n   borrowing against weETH\n3. Increased DeFi opportunities for Moonwell users on Base\n\n### Security and Smart Contract Information\n\n- Multiple audits performed (details available in\n  [Ether.fi documentation](https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi))\n- Active bug bounty program\n- DAO Governance with 3-day timelock before onchain upgrades/updates can be\n  executed\n\n### Gauntlet Risk Parameter Recommendations\n\nGauntlet, Moonwell's lead risk manager, has provided the following risk\nparameters for the weETH market:\n\n#### Risk Parameters\n\n| Parameter            | Value |\n| -------------------- | ----- |\n| Collateral Factor    | 74%   |\n| Supply Cap           | 900   |\n| Borrow Cap           | 350   |\n| Protocol Seize Share | 30%   |\n\n#### Interest Rate Parameters\n\n| IR Parameter    | Recommended Value |\n| --------------- | ----------------- |\n| Base            | 0                 |\n| Kink            | 0.35              |\n| Multiplier      | 0.15              |\n| Jump Multiplier | 4.5               |\n| Reserve Factor  | 0.15              |\n\n## Voting Options\n\n- For: Approve the addition of weETH as a new market on Moonwell's Base\n  deployment\n- Against: Reject the addition of weETH as a new market on Moonwell's Base\n  deployment\n- Abstain\n",

`0x7F953f11343408eBCcaEcd04eB0D1E6bacDEf87F`.\n# Safety Module\nAt the time this proposal was generated there was `364,353,497` **MFAM** staked in the **Safety Module**, with a valuation of `$446,173.88` (based on a **MFAM** price of `$0.001225` pulled from **SolarBeam**).\n\nThis proposal, if executed, would adjust the rewards on the **Safety Module** to <span

      "title": "[Temp Check] Add weETH Markets to Moonwell on Base",
      "content": "1. Proposal Submission\nTitle: Add weETH market to Moonwell on Base\n\nCategory: Community Proposals 3\n\nDescription:\nGreetings Moonwell family, Justin from Ether.fi  here with a proposal for you! This proposal aims to add a new market for weETH on the Base network. This proposal includes a detailed risk assessment, benefits to the Moonwell community, and required information to facilitate the listing process.\n\nRequired Information\nGeneral\nToken Asset Name: weETH\nDescription of the Project and the Token: Ether.fi is a decentralized, non-custodial liquid staking protocol built on Ethereum, allowing users to stake their ETH and participate in the DeFi ecosystem without losing liquidity. The protocol’s eETH is a liquid restaking token (weETH is the non-rebasing equivalent), serving as a representation of ETH staked on the Beacon Chain, which rebases daily to reflect the associated staking rewards. Users can deposit ETH into the liquidity pool on Ethereum Mainnet to mint eETH, hold eETH to accrue rewards, and use eETH within DeFi or swap it back to ETH at any time via the liquidity pool. The protocol currently employs a permissioned validator set, transitioning to permissionless based on the protocol roadmap. ETH staked through the Ether.fi liquidity pool accrues normal Ethereum staking rewards and will also be natively restaked with EigenLayer. Staking with eETH on Ether.fi automatically natively restakes that ETH to EigenLayer and accrues normal staking rewards while allowing users to keep composability on their eETH in other DeFi protocols. The eETH contract has been live since June 2023, with weETH launching to the open market on November 15th, 2023, and has approximately 1,814,766.66 ETH held within it. Being a liquid representation of staked Ethereum, the price of the token is aligned with the price of ETH. Through these mechanisms, eETH acts as a conduit for individuals to engage in Ethereum’s staking & restaking process with added liquidity, making it easier for them to enter and exit staking positions while also benefiting from boosted rewards.\nBenefits to the Moonwell Community: Ether.fi is looking to enhance liquidity for weETH on Base. Incentivizing a Moonwell pool will continue to boost the liquidity of the LRT on Base. Higher liquidity ensures that traders and investors can easily enter or exit positions, which is essential for the overall usability and attractiveness of the LRT token within the L2 DeFi ecosystem. Users who deposit into Moonwell will also be able to earn Etherfi points and Eigenlayer points, which count towards our Season 3 community allocations. Having weETH on Moonwell will allow users to earn Etherfi points and Eigenlayer points while supplying and borrowing against weETH. This can be done by depositing weETH onto Moonwell and borrowing against it.\nResources:\nWebsite:  https://www.ether.fi/\nDocumentation: https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/ether.fi-whitepaper\nWhitepaper: https://etherfi.gitbook.io/etherfi/ether.fi-whitepaper\nGithub: https://github.com/etherfi-protocol\nDiscord: \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ether_fi\nProposal Author’s Contact Information: Justin@ether.fi\nRelationship between the Author and the Token: Representative of Ether.fi \nSocial Channel Metrics:\nTwitter: 155,943\nDiscord: 38,733 members\nCommunity Activity: Active\nMarket Risk Assessment\nMarket Cap: $4,501,927,254.00 on mainnet\n\nTotal Supply: 1,391,974.6199 weETH\n\nExchanges and Liquidity:\n\nCentralized Exchanges: Gate.io, Bybit, Mexc\nDecentralized Exchanges: Uniswap : $176.5 Million \nCamelot V3: $2.43 Million \nBalancer: $39.8 Million \nBase specific liquidity\n\nTotal supply: 2,969.97 weETH on Base\nVelodrome : 289.655 weETH\nUniswap: 99.02 weETH\nVolatility (30 days, 90 days, 1 year): This token is a rebasing version of eETH that is pegged 1:1 with Ethereum.\n\nAverage Daily Trading Volume: $54,399,199\n\nGini Coefficient and Herfindahl Index: N/A\n\nEmission Schedule: This token is minted by wrapping eETH, and is backed by ETH.

      "title": "MIP-O01: Optimism Activation - Part 2",
      "content": "I propose that the Moonwell DAO votes to authorize the activation of the Moonwell Protocol on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/). By leveraging Optimism's advanced scaling solutions, shared values, and robust funding opportunities, we'll be able to significantly expand Moonwell's reach and impact.\n\nActivating Moonwell on OP Mainnet will allow Moonwell opportunities to:\n1. Become the leading lending protocol on Optimism\n2. Align with shared values and ecosystem goals\n3. Access the Optimism Foundation's generous funding and incentives programs\n\n## About Optimism\n\nOptimism is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain network developed by OP Labs and deployed in 2021. Utilizing [Optimistic Rollups](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/protocol/rollup/overview), Optimism bundles transactions off-chain and posts transaction data (blobs) to Ethereum mainnet. It is designed to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs while maintaining the security that Ethereum mainnet provides. The recent implementation of [EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com/) and \"blobspace\" has further reduced transaction fees on both Base and Optimism, aligning with the Moonwell community's mission of making onchain finance accessible to everyone.\n\nOptimism shares foundational technological and philosophical principles with Base, which [Moonwell was activated](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/mip-39-activate-moonwell-on-base-mainnet/414) on in March 2023. Optimism and Base are both built on the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/), a set of MIT-licensed open-source software designed to enhance Ethereum's scalability and modularity. The OP Stack facilitates the creation of interoperable Layer 2 solutions, contributing to a larger \"Superchain\" vision where multiple Layer 2 networks can operate cohesively. Optimism and Base are both committed to the Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) model, which incentivizes the development of open-source projects that benefit the entire Superchain ecosystem.\n\nSince its inception in 2021, Optimism has supported around 370 dApps and has a Total Value Locked (TVL) of approximately $884.81 million. The network has saved users over $1 billion in gas fees. Statistics on lending protocols on Optimism can be found [here](https://defillama.com/chain/Optimism); as of June 16, 2024, the lending protocols on Optimism with the highest TVL are Aave v3 ($160.5m), Exactly ($10.08m), and Compound v3 ($6.32m). The recent exploit of the lending protocol Sonne Finance has created a significant gap in the Optimism lending ecosystem. This presents an ideal opportunity for Moonwell to step in and establish itself as the go-to lending solution on the network.\n\nOptimism's roadmap focuses on enhancing scalability and decentralization. A significant milestone was recently achieved with the launch of [permissionless fault proofs](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/izdAoJ8ooyhDfwFLFoCcUfB1icPLFn8AImBws4oaqw8) on OP Mainnet, marking Optimism's arrival at Stage 1 decentralization. This enables withdrawals without trusted third parties and allows users to challenge invalid withdrawals. Optimism is now working towards [Stage 2 decentralization](https://blog.oplabs.co/endgame-is-stage-2/) by implementing multiple proof systems, including zero-knowledge proofs. The fault proof proposal was approved by Optimism's governance process, and additional proof systems will be rolled out on testnet to ensure reliability and robustness.\n\nActivating Moonwell on Optimism aligns the protocol with a network dedicated to efficiency, accessibility, decentralization, and community-driven development, positioning Moonwell at the forefront of the rapidly evolving Superchain ecosystem.\n\n## Motivation\n\nActivating Moonwell on Optimism offers a number of benefits to the Moonwell community, including opportunities to:\n\n1. Become the Leading Lending Protocol on Optimism\n2. Align with Shared Values and Ecosystem Goals\n3. Access Optimism's Substantial Funding and Incentive Programs\n\n### Become the Leading Lending Protocol on Optimism\n\nThere is a massive opportunity for Moonwell to capture a large portion of lending TVL on Optimism, especially in light of the recent Sonne Finance exploit. Aave, the current TVL leader, is a low-effort deployment lacking a Safety Module and additional market incentives. The current state of lending on Optimism is available [here](https://defillama.com/protocols/Lending/Optimism) on DeFi Llama. By deploying Moonwell on Optimism, we can tap into this established DeFi landscape, attracting a broader user base seeking efficient and cost-effective financial services.\n\n### Align with Shared Values and Ecosystem Goals\n\nMoonwell and Optimism share a common vision centered on decentralization, security, and community governance. Optimism's governance model, which includes the [Retroactive Public Goods Funding](https://retropgfhub.com/) (RetroPGF) initiative, aligns with Moonwell's commitment to fostering an open, community-driven ecosystem​. See the Optimism Collective Constitution [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55).\n\nThe governance of the Moonwell Protocol on Optimism will be managed by WELL token holders, though note that [xWELL](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/mip-m23-and-mip-m24-multichain-governor-and-well-migration/820#mutichain-well-xwell-9) (multichain native, xERC-20 WELL), the multichain vote collector contract, and the Safety Module will be activated in a later proposal following initial activation. Halborn Security is anticipated to conduct code reviews to verify all the deployment parameters. Moreover, Moonwell markets on Optimism will be safeguarded against price manipulation through the use of [Chainlink oracle price feeds](https://blog.chain.link/levels-of-data-aggregation-in-chainlink-price-feeds/). Moonwell contributor and lead risk manager Gauntlet will conduct regular economic simulations to confirm that asset risk parameters are maintained at safe levels.\n\n### Access Optimism's Funding and Incentive Programs\n\nOptimism has well-known and extremely generous funding and incentive programs we can leverage to bolster liquidity in our markets and drive user adoption. In 2023, the Moonwell community successfully secured a [Retro PGF3 grant](https://optimism-agora-prod.agora-prod.workers.dev/retropgf/3/application/0xeff464a4d1163c24dea3777598667b31c6b68cea03649e0e8dbaa80fad82fc5f) of 54,658 OP tokens and 80,156 OP for [Retro PGF4](https://x.com/MoonwellDeFi/status/1813983656308080718). All granted OP tokens will be used as liquidity incentives, bootstrapping markets and further boosting the growth and adoption of Moonwell on the Optimism network.\n\n## Proposed Markets\n\nI propose activating the Moonwell Protocol on Optimism with the following initial lending markets:\n\n- WETH: [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006)\n- USDC: [0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85)\n- USDT: [0x94b008aa00579c1307b0ef2c499ad98a8ce58e58](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x94b008aa00579c1307b0ef2c499ad98a8ce58e58)\n- DAI: [0xda10009cbd5d07dd0cecc66161fc93d7c9000da1](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xda10009cbd5d07dd0cecc66161fc93d7c9000da1)\n- WBTC: [0x68f180fcce6836688e9084f035309e29bf0a2095](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x68f180fcce6836688e9084f035309e29bf0a2095)\n- wstETH: [0x1f32b1c2345538c0c6f582fcb022739c4a194ebb](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x1f32b1c2345538c0c6f582fcb022739c4a194ebb)\n- cbETH: [0xaddb6a0412de1ba0f936dcaeb8aaa24578dcf3b2](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xaddb6a0412de1ba0f936dcaeb8aaa24578dcf3b2)\n- rETH: [0x9bcef72be871e61ed4fbbc7630889bee758eb81d](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9bcef72be871e61ed4fbbc763088)\n- OP: [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042)\n- VELO: [0x3c8b650257cfb5f272f799f5e2b4e65093a11a05](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3c8b650257cfb5f272f799f5e2b4e65093a11a05)\n\nPlease note that OP and VELO markets were inadvertently left off of the MIP-O00 proposal description, but are included in the OP Mainnet activation proposals.\n\nAll proposed assets already possess Chainlink price feeds and their markets will be initially set to 0% CF to protect against the [Hundred Finance](https://rekt.news/hundred-rekt2/) exploit. Gauntlet will be able to update market risk parameters such as Collateral Factors following initial market activation in their monthly risk parameter adjustment MIPs. As with Moonwell's Base deployment, Gauntlet will also be able to adjust supply and borrow caps dynamically through their Cap Guardian role.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis is a continuation of MIP-O00, which accepted admin as the Temporal Governor\nand set the WELL emission configs. This governance proposal unpauses and mints a\nsmall amount of each market's mToken to mitigate against the\n[Hundred Finance](https://rekt.news/hundred-rekt2/) exploit.\n\nMIP-O00 was originally going to be submitted as a single proposal. However, it\nhas been split into two activation proposals to work around the transaction gas\nlimit on Moonbeam.\n",

      "title": "MIP-O00: Optimism Activation - Part 1",
      "content": "I propose that the Moonwell DAO votes to authorize the activation of the\nMoonwell Protocol on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/). By leveraging\nOptimism’s advanced scaling solutions, shared values, and robust funding\nopportunities, we’ll be able to significantly expand Moonwell’s reach and\nimpact.\n\nActivating Moonwell on OP Mainnet will allow Moonwell opportunities to (1)\nbecome the leading lending protocol on Optimism, (2) align with shared values\nand ecosystem goals, and (3) access the Optimism Foundation’s generous funding\nand incentives programs.\n\n## About Optimism\n\nOptimism is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain network developed by OP Labs and\ndeployed in 2021. Utilizing\n[Optimistic Rollups](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/protocol/rollup/overview),\nOptimism bundles transactions off-chain and posts transaction data (blobs) to\nEthereum mainnet. It is designed to enhance scalability and reduce transaction\ncosts while maintaining the security that Ethereum mainnet provides. The recent\nimplementation of [EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com/) and “blobspace” has\nfurther reduced transaction fees on both Base and Optimism, aligning with the\nMoonwell community’s mission of making onchain finance accessible to everyone.\n\nOptimism shares foundational technological and philosophical principles with\nBase, which\n[Moonwell was activated on](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/mip-39-activate-moonwell-on-base-mainnet/414)\nin March 2023. Optimism and Base are both built on the\n[OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io), a set of MIT-licensed open-source software\ndesigned to enhance Ethereum’s scalability and modularity. The OP Stack\nfacilitates the creation of interoperable Layer 2 solutions, contributing to a\nlarger “Superchain” vision where multiple Layer 2 networks can operate\ncohesively. Optimism and Base are both committed to the Retroactive Public Goods\nFunding (RetroPGF) model, which incentivizes the development of open-source\nprojects that benefit the entire Superchain ecosystem.\n\nSince its inception in 2021, Optimism has supported around 370 dApps and has a\nTotal Value Locked (TVL) of approximately $884.81 million. The network has saved\nusers over $1 billion in gas fees. Statistics on lending protocols on Optimism\ncan be found [here](https://defillama.com/chain/Optimism); as of June 16, 2024,\nthe lending protocols on Optimism with the highest TVL are Aave v3 ($160.5m),\nExactly ($10.08m), and Compound v3 ($6.32m). The\n[recent exploit](https://rekt.news/sonne-finance-rekt/) of the lending protocol\nSonne Finance has created a significant gap in the Optimism lending ecosystem.\nThis presents an ideal opportunity for Moonwell to step in and establish itself\nas the go-to lending solution on the network.\n\nOptimism’s roadmap focuses on enhancing scalability and decentralization. A\nsignificant milestone was recently achieved with the launch of\n[permissionless fault proofs on OP Mainnet](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/izdAoJ8ooyhDfwFLFoCcUfB1icPLFn8AImBws4oaqw8),\nmarking Optimism’s arrival at Stage 1 decentralization. This enables withdrawals\nwithout trusted third parties and allows users to challenge invalid withdrawals.\nOptimism is now working towards\n[Stage 2 decentralization](https://blog.oplabs.co/endgame-is-stage-2/) by\nimplementing multiple proof systems, including zero-knowledge proofs. The fault\nproof proposal was approved by Optimism’s governance process, and additional\nproof systems will be rolled out on testnet to ensure reliability and\nrobustness.\n\nActivating Moonwell on Optimism aligns the protocol with a network dedicated to\nefficiency, accessibility, decentralization, and community-driven development,\npositioning Moonwell at the forefront of the rapidly evolving Superchain\necosystem.\n\n## Motivation\n\nActivating Moonwell on Optimism offers a number of benefits to the Moonwell\ncommunity, including opportunities to:\n\n1. Become the Leading Lending Protocol on Optimism\n2. Align with Shared Values and Ecosystem Goals\n3. Access Optimism’s Substantial Funding and Incentive Programs\n\n### Become the Leading Lending Protocol on Optimism\n\nThere is a massive opportunity for Moonwell to capture a large portion of\nlending TVL on Optimism, especially in light of the recent Sonne Finance\nexploit. [Aave](https://aave.com/), the current TVL leader, is a low-effort\ndeployment lacking a Safety Module and additional market incentives. The current\nstate of lending on Optimism is available here on\n[DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/protocols/Lending/Optimism). By deploying\nMoonwell on Optimism, we can tap into this established DeFi landscape,\nattracting a broader user base seeking efficient and cost-effective financial\nservices.\n\n### Align with Shared Values and Ecosystem Goals\n\nMoonwell and Optimism share a common vision centered on decentralization,\nsecurity, and community governance. Optimism’s governance model, which includes\nthe [Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF)](https://retropgfhub.com/)\ninitiative, aligns with Moonwell’s commitment to fostering an open,\ncommunity-driven ecosystem​. See the Optimism Collective Constitution\n[here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55).\n\nThe governance of the Moonwell Protocol on Optimism will be managed by WELL\ntoken holders, though note that\n[xWELL](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/mip-m23-and-mip-m24-multichain-governor-and-well-migration/820#mutichain-well-xwell-9)\n(multichain native, xERC-20 WELL), the multichain vote collector contract, and\nthe Safety Module will be activated in a later proposal following initial\nactivation. Halborn Security is anticipated to conduct code reviews to verify\nall the deployment parameters. Moreover, Moonwell markets on Optimism will be\nsafeguarded against price manipulation through the use of\n[Chainlink oracle price feeds](https://blog.chain.link/levels-of-data-aggregation-in-chainlink-price-feeds/).\nMoonwell contributor and lead risk manager Gauntlet will conduct regular\neconomic simulations to confirm that asset risk parameters are maintained at\nsafe levels.\n\n### Access Optimism’s Funding and Incentive Programs\n\nOptimism has well-known and extremely generous funding and incentive programs we\ncan leverage to bolster liquidity in our markets and drive user adoption. In\n2023, the Moonwell community successfully secured a\n[Retro PGF3 grant](https://optimism-agora-prod.agora-prod.workers.dev/retropgf/3/application/0xeff464a4d1163c24dea3777598667b31c6b68cea03649e0e8dbaa80fad82fc5f)\nof 54,658 OP tokens and we have also applied for Retro PGF4. In addition to\nRetroPGF grants, Moonwell contributors have been approached about an upcoming\nincentives program that will grant OP tokens to projects activating on Optimism.\nAll granted OP tokens will be used as liquidity incentives, bootstrapping\nmarkets and further boosting the growth and adoption of Moonwell on the Optimism\nnetwork.\n\n## Proposed Markets\n\nI propose activating the Moonwell Protocol on Optimism with the following\ninitial lending markets:\n\n- **WETH**:\n  [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006)\n- **USDC**:\n  [0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85)\n- **USDT**:\n  [0x94b008aa00579c1307b0ef2c499ad98a8ce58e58](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x94b008aa00579c1307b0ef2c499ad98a8ce58e58)\n- **DAI**:\n  [0xda10009cbd5d07dd0cecc66161fc93d7c9000da1](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xda10009cbd5d07dd0cecc66161fc93d7c9000da1)\n- **WBTC**:\n  [0x68f180fcce6836688e9084f035309e29bf0a2095](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x68f180fcce6836688e9084f035309e29bf0a2095)\n- **wstETH**:\n  [0x1f32b1c2345538c0c6f582fcb022739c4a194ebb](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x1f32b1c2345538c0c6f582fcb022739c4a194ebb)\n- **cbETH**:\n  [0xaddb6a0412de1ba0f936dcaeb8aaa24578dcf3b2](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xaddb6a0412de1ba0f936dcaeb8aaa24578dcf3b2)\n- **rETH**:\n  [0x9bcef72be871e61ed4fbbc7630889bee758eb81d](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9bcef72be871e61ed4fbbc763088)\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis governance proposal accepts the administrator role as the Temporal Governor\nand creates the initial WELL reward configurations on all markets, enabling WELL\nrewards for both borrowing and lending.\n",

      "content": "## Proposal Overview\n\nThis governance proposal aims to activate the WELL token on the Optimism (OP\nMainnet) network and facilitate its cross-network transfer capabilities,\nalongside upgrades to the Multichain Governor on Moonbeam and Vote Collection\ncontract on Base.\n\nThe proposal includes the following key actions:\n\n1. **WELL Token Activation on Optimism:** Enable the WELL token to be\n   transferred and used on OP Mainnet.\n2. **Multichain Vote Collection Contract:** Add the Multichain Vote Collection\n   contract on OP Mainnet as a trusted sender on Moonbeam. This allows the WELL\n   token to participate in governance on Optimism and ensures that new proposals\n   are broadcast to this network.\n3. **Governor and Vote Collection Contract Upgrade:** Upgrade the Multichain\n   Governor on Moonbeam and the Vote Collection contract on Base to refund\n   excess native tokens when proposing or emitting votes.\n4. **WELL Token Implementation Upgrade:** Upgrade the WELL token implementation\n   on both Base and Moonbeam to allow the contract owner the ability to unpause\n   the contracts. Following a successful governance proposal, the community can\n   vote to unpause the xWELL token if it has previously been paused by the\n   guardian.\n\n## Multi-Network Proposal\n\nThis proposal, designated as MIP-X01, marks a significant milestone as the first\nof its kind. Typically, MIP proposals are network-specific, indicated by a\nletter representing the network where updates will be executed (e.g., 'B' for\nBase, 'M' for Moonbeam, 'R' for MoonRiver). However, the 'X' in MIP-X01\nsignifies that this is a \"multi-network\" proposal, executing changes across\nmultiple networks.\n\n## Testing and Security\n\nThese changes have undergone rigorous testing and auditing processes to ensure\ntheir safety and reliability:\n\n- **Unit and Integration Testing:** Comprehensive tests have been conducted to\n  verify the functionality and performance of the proposed changes.\n- **Audit by Halborn:** A thorough audit was performed by Halborn to identify\n  and mitigate potential security risks.\n- **Review by Solidity Labs Engineer:** An independent review was carried out by\n  a Solidity Labs engineer to validate the code and its implications.\n- **Formal Proofs:** Formal proofs were executed again to demonstrate the safety\n  and correctness of the code changes.\n\n## Voting Options\n\n- **Yay:** Vote in favor of the proposal to activate the WELL token on OP\n  Mainnet, upgrade the Multichain Governor and Vote Collection contracts, and\n  allow for the unpausing of the xWELL token by community vote.\n- **Nay:** Vote against the proposal and maintain the current state of the WELL\n  token and related contracts.\n",

      "content": "## Proposal Overview\n\nThis governance proposal aims to activate the WELL token on the Optimism (OP\nMainnet) network and facilitate its cross-network transfer capabilities,\nalongside upgrades to the Multichain Governor on Moonbeam and Vote Collection\ncontract on Base.\n\nThe proposal includes the following key actions:\n\n1. **WELL Token Activation on Optimism:** Enable the WELL token to be\n   transferred and used on OP Mainnet.\n2. **Multichain Vote Collection Contract:** Add the Multichain Vote Collection\n   contract on OP Mainnet as a trusted sender on Moonbeam. This allows the WELL\n   token to participate in governance on Optimism and ensures that new proposals\n   are broadcast to this network.\n3. **Governor and Vote Collection Contract Upgrade:** Upgrade the Multichain\n   Governor on Moonbeam and the Vote Collection contract on Base to refund\n   excess native tokens when proposing or emitting votes.\n4. **WELL Token Implementation Upgrade:** Upgrade the WELL token implementation\n   on both Base and Moonbeam to allow the contract owner the ability to unpause\n   the contracts. Following a successful governance proposal, the community can\n   vote to unpause the xWELL token if it has previously been paused by the\n   guardian.\n\n## Multi-Network Proposal\n\nThis proposal, designated as MIP-X01, marks a significant milestone as the first\nof its kind. Typically, MIP proposals are network-specific, indicated by a\nletter representing the network where updates will be executed (e.g., 'B' for\nBase, 'M' for Moonbeam, 'R' for MoonRiver). However, the 'X' in MIP-X01\nsignifies that this is a \"multi-network\" proposal, executing changes across\nmultiple networks.\n\n## Testing and Security\n\nThese changes have undergone rigorous testing and auditing processes to ensure\ntheir safety and reliability:\n\n- **Unit and Integration Testing:** Comprehensive tests have been conducted to\n  verify the functionality and performance of the proposed changes.\n- **Audit by Halborn:** A thorough audit was performed by Halborn to identify\n  and mitigate potential security risks.\n- **Review by Solidity Labs Engineer:** An independent review was carried out by\n  a Solidity Labs engineer to validate the code and its implications.\n- **Formal Proofs:** Formal proofs were executed again to demonstrate the safety\n  and correctness of the code changes.\n\n## Voting Options\n\n- **Yay:** Vote in favor of the proposal to activate the WELL token on OP\n  Mainnet, upgrade the Multichain Governor and Vote Collection contracts, and\n  allow for the unpausing of the xWELL token by community vote.\n- **Nay:** Vote against the proposal and maintain the current state of the WELL\n  token and related contracts.\n",

      "title": "Activate Moonwell Protocol on Optimism",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nI propose that the Moonwell DAO [WELL] votes to authorize the activation of the Moonwell Protocol on [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/). By leveraging Optimism’s advanced scaling solutions, shared values, and robust funding opportunities, we’ll be able to significantly expand Moonwell's reach and impact.\n\nActivating Moonwell on OP Mainnet will allow Moonwell opportunities to (1) become the leading lending protocol on Optimism, (2) align with shared values and ecosystem goals, and (3) access the Optimism Foundation’s generous funding and incentives programs.\n\n## About Optimism\n\nOptimism is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain network developed by OP Labs and deployed in 2021. Utilizing [Optimistic Rollups](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/protocol/rollup/overview), Optimism bundles transactions off-chain and posts transaction data (blobs) to Ethereum mainnet. It is designed to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs while maintaining the security that Ethereum mainnet provides. The recent implementation of [EIP-4844](https://www.eip4844.com/) and “blobspace” has further reduced transaction fees on both Base and Optimism, aligning with the Moonwell community’s mission of making onchain finance accessible to everyone.\n\nOptimism shares foundational technological and philosophical principles with Base, which [Moonwell was activated on](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/mip-39-activate-moonwell-on-base-mainnet/414) in March 2023. Optimism and Base are both built on the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io), a set of MIT-licensed open-source software designed to enhance Ethereum's scalability and modularity. The OP Stack facilitates the creation of interoperable Layer 2 solutions, contributing to a larger “Superchain” vision where multiple Layer 2 networks can operate cohesively. Optimism and Base are both committed to the Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) model, which incentivizes the development of open-source projects that benefit the entire Superchain ecosystem.\n\nSince its inception in 2021, Optimism has supported around 370 dApps and has a Total Value Locked (TVL) of approximately $884.81 million. The network has saved users over $1 billion in gas fees. Statistics on lending protocols on Optimism can be found [here](https://defillama.com/chain/Optimism); as of June 16, 2024, the lending protocols on Optimism with the highest TVL are Aave v3 ($160.5m), Exactly ($10.08m), and Compound v3 ($6.32m). The [recent exploit](https://rekt.news/sonne-finance-rekt/) of the lending protocol Sonne Finance has created a significant gap in the Optimism lending ecosystem. This presents an ideal opportunity for Moonwell to step in and establish itself as the go-to lending solution on the network.\n\nOptimism's roadmap focuses on enhancing scalability and decentralization. A significant milestone was recently achieved with the launch of [permissionless fault proofs on OP Mainne](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/izdAoJ8ooyhDfwFLFoCcUfB1icPLFn8AImBws4oaqw8)t, marking Optimism’s arrival at Stage 1 decentralization. This enables withdrawals without trusted third parties and allows users to challenge invalid withdrawals. Optimism is now working towards [Stage 2 decentralization](https://blog.oplabs.co/endgame-is-stage-2/) by implementing multiple proof systems, including zero-knowledge proofs. The fault proof proposal was approved by Optimism's governance process, and additional proof systems will be rolled out on testnet to ensure reliability and robustness.\n\nActivating Moonwell on Optimism aligns the protocol with a network dedicated to efficiency, accessibility, decentralization, and community-driven development, positioning Moonwell at the forefront of the rapidly evolving Superchain ecosystem.\n\n## Motivation\n\nActivating Moonwell on Optimism offers a number of benefits to the Moonwell community, including opportunities to:\n\n1. Become the Leading Lending Protocol on Optimism\n2. Align with Shared Values and Ecosystem Goals\n3. Access Optimism’s Substantial Funding and Incentive Programs\n\n### Become the Leading Lending Protocol on Optimism\n\nThere is a massive opportunity for Moonwell to capture a large portion of lending TVL on Optimism, especially in light of the recent Sonne Finance exploit. [Aave](https://aave.com/), the current TVL leader, is a low-effort deployment lacking a Safety Module and additional market incentives. The current state of lending on Optimism is available here on [DeFi Llama](https://defillama.com/protocols/Lending/Optimism). By deploying Moonwell on Optimism, we can tap into this established DeFi landscape, attracting a broader user base seeking efficient and cost-effective financial services.\n\n### Align with Shared Values and Ecosystem Goals\n\nMoonwell and Optimism share a common vision centered on decentralization, security, and community governance. Optimism’s governance model, which includes the [Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF)](https://retropgfhub.com/) initiative, aligns with Moonwell’s commitment to fostering an open, community-driven ecosystem​. See the Optimism Collective Constitution [here](https://gov.optimism.io/t/working-constitution-of-the-optimism-collective/55).\n\nThe governance of the Moonwell Protocol on Optimism will be managed by WELL token holders, though note that [xWELL](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/mip-m23-and-mip-m24-multichain-governor-and-well-migration/820#mutichain-well-xwell-9) (multichain native, xERC-20 WELL), the multichain vote collector contract, and the Safety Module will be activated in a later proposal following initial activation. Halborn Security is anticipated to conduct code reviews to verify all the deployment parameters. Moreover, Moonwell markets on Optimism will be safeguarded against price manipulation through the use of [Chainlink oracle price feeds](https://blog.chain.link/levels-of-data-aggregation-in-chainlink-price-feeds/). Moonwell contributor and lead risk manager Gauntlet will conduct regular economic simulations to confirm that asset risk parameters are maintained at safe levels.\n\n### Access Optimism’s Funding and Incentive Programs\n\nOptimism has well-known and extremely generous funding and incentive programs we can leverage to bolster liquidity in our markets and drive user adoption. In 2023, the Moonwell community successfully secured a [Retro PGF3 grant](https://optimism-agora-prod.agora-prod.workers.dev/retropgf/3/application/0xeff464a4d1163c24dea3777598667b31c6b68cea03649e0e8dbaa80fad82fc5f) of 54,658 OP tokens and we have also applied for Retro PGF4. In addition to RetroPGF grants, Moonwell contributors have been approached about an upcoming incentives program that will grant OP tokens to projects activating on Optimism. All granted OP tokens will be used as liquidity incentives, bootstrapping markets and further boosting the growth and adoption of Moonwell on the Optimism network.\n\n## Proposed Markets\n\nI propose activating the Moonwell Protocol on Optimism with the following initial lending markets:\n\n- **WETH**: [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006)\n- **USDC**: [0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85)\n- **USDT**: [0x94b008aa00579c1307b0ef2c499ad98a8ce58e58](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x94b008aa00579c1307b0ef2c499ad98a8ce58e58)\n- **DAI**: [0xda10009cbd5d07dd0cecc66161fc93d7c9000da1](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xda10009cbd5d07dd0cecc66161fc93d7c9000da1)\n- **WBTC**: [0x68f180fcce6836688e9084f035309e29bf0a2095](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x68f180fcce6836688e9084f035309e29bf0a2095)\n- **wstETH**: [0x1f32b1c2345538c0c6f582fcb022739c4a194ebb](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x1f32b1c2345538c0c6f582fcb022739c4a194ebb)\n- **cbETH**: [0xaddb6a0412de1ba0f936dcaeb8aaa24578dcf3b2](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xaddb6a0412de1ba0f936dcaeb8aaa24578dcf3b2)\n- **rETH**: [0x9bcef72be871e61ed4fbbc7630889bee758eb81d](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x9bcef72be871e61ed4fbbc7630889bee758eb81d)\n- **OP**: [0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042)\n- **VELO**: [0x3c8b650257cfb5f272f799f5e2b4e65093a11a05](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x3c8b650257cfb5f272f799f5e2b4e65093a11a05)\n\nAll proposed assets already possess Chainlink price feeds and their markets will be initially set to 0% CF to protect against the [“Hundred Finance exploit”](https://rekt.news/hundred-rekt2/). Gauntlet will be able to update market risk parameters such as Collateral Factors following initial market activation in their monthly risk parameter adjustment MIPs. As with Moonwell’s Base deployment, Gauntlet will also be able to adjust supply and borrow caps dynamically through their Cap Guardian role, which will be included in the subsequent onchain activation proposal.\n\n## Voting\n\nAll Moonwell DAO members are encouraged to vote on this proposal. Voting options include:\n\n- **Yes**: Activate the Moonwell Protocol on Optimism\n- **No**: Make no change\n\n## Conclusion\n\nActivating Moonwell on Optimism offers the opportunity to become the leading lending protocol on the network, align with shared values and ecosystem goals, and access substantial funding and incentive programs provided by the Optimism Foundation. These benefits will enhance our platform's development, improve user adoption, and drive product innovation.\n\nI welcome any questions, comments, or requests for clarification. I’m very excited about the prospect of activating Moonwell on another values-aligned chain, and I’m keen to move this forward for onchain voting next week if this Snapshot is successful!",

      "title": "MIP-B21 Accepting Ownership and Incentivizing Moonwell MetaMorpho Vaults",
      "content": "**Author(s):** Block Analitica and B.Protocol\n\n**Related Discussions:**\n[Moonwell MetaMorpho Vaults - Next Gen DeFi Lending](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/introducing-moonwell-metamorpho-vaults-next-gen-defi-lending/960)\n\n**Related Snapshot Proposal:**\n[Temp Check Snapshot Proposal](https://snapshot.moonwell.fi/#/proposal/0x8d297b61bdc0361c3ff9d26f591b2758c7d6c821b61ee98788b51927cb613051)\n\n**Submission Date:** June 12, 2024\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish a collaboration between the Moonwell DAO, Block\nAnalitica, B.Protocol, and the Morpho DAO to deploy, manage, and incentivize\nMoonwell MetaMorpho vaults. These optimized lending vaults will bring the next\ngeneration of optimized lending to the Moonwell ecosystem and offer Moonwell\nusers enhanced capital efficiency, flexibility, and risk management. Through\nthis collaboration, we aim to attract substantial new capital and users to the\nMoonwell ecosystem, setting a new standard for risk-conscious DeFi lending.\nInitial vaults will support USDC and ETH, with WELL incentives distributed over\na 6-month period to incentivize TVL growth. A 10% performance fee will be\nimplemented, with the Moonwell DAO’s share being directed to existing USDC and\nETH protocol reserves.\n\n## Vault Configuration\n\nFollowing the community’s overwhelming support for and passage of our\n[temperature check Snapshot proposal](https://snapshot.moonwell.fi/#/proposal/0x8d297b61bdc0361c3ff9d26f591b2758c7d6c821b61ee98788b51927cb613051),\nwe have deployed USDC and ETH MetaMorpho vaults with specific configurations for\nownership, curation, allocation, guardianship, performance fees, timelock\nperiods, and vault names/symbols. Through the passage of MIP-B21, ownership of\nthe two vaults will be assigned to the Moonwell DAO (Moonwell Temporal Governor\ncontract).\n\n### Roles\n\n- **Owner:** Moonwell DAO\n- **Curator:** Block Analitica & B.Protocol\n- **Allocator:** Public allocator contract and Risk Manager Multisig\n- **Guardian:** Moonwell Security Council\n\n### Performance Fee\n\nA 10% performance fee will be implemented and split between Block\nAnalitica/B.Protocol and the Moonwell DAO. The Moonwell DAO's portion will be\nadded to the existing USDC and ETH Moonwell protocol reserves in regular\nintervals, allowing the Moonwell protocol to recognize income as fees.\n\n- **Timelock period:** 4 days\n- **Vault names:** Moonwell Flagship USDC, Moonwell Flagship ETH\n- **Symbols:** mwUSDC, mwETH\n\n## Liquidity Incentives\n\nAs part of this proposal, we are requesting a grant from the Moonwell DAO of 50m\nWELL tokens to be utilized as liquidity incentives. Initial WELL liquidity\nincentives will be distributed to the vaults over a 6-month period through\nMorpho's URD (Universal Reward Distributor) contract at the vault level,\nenabling reward visibility on both Morpho and Moonwell applications. These\nsubstantial incentives, coupled with MORPHO rewards, will be pivotal in\nattracting new capital and distinguishing Moonwell MetaMorpho vaults from\ncompetitor vaults.\n\n### Incentive Distribution Schedule\n\n- **1/6 (8.33m WELL)** over the first 2 months\n- **2/6 (16.66m WELL)** over the following 2 months\n- **3/6 (25m WELL)** over the last 2 months\n\nThe proposed initial breakdown is 50/50% between the two vaults, subject to\nadjustment based on TVL fluctuations. This incentive distribution will be\noperationally handled by the Morpho DAO. This\n[gradual distribution method](https://forum.morpho.org/t/standard-method-for-distributing-incentives-on-morpho-blue-markets/412)\nhas been tried and tested by the Morpho DAO on Ethereum mainnet.\n\n## Implementation\n\nIf this proposal passes, the following onchain actions will be executed:\n\n1. Moonwell DAO accepts ownership of Moonwell Flagship USDC Vault\n2. Moonwell DAO accepts ownership of Moonwell Flagship ETH Vault\n3. A grant of 50m WELL tokens to be utilized as Morpho liquidity incentives will\n   be sent to the Moonwell MetaMorpho URD for distribution through merkle roots\n   according to the proposed schedule, with operational handling by the Morpho\n   DAO.\n\n## Voting\n\n- **Yay:** Accept ownership of Moonwell Flagship USDC and ETH MetaMorpho vaults\n  and allocation and distribution of WELL incentives through the Moonwell\n  MetaMorpho URD contract.\n- **Nay:** Reject ownership of Moonwell Flagship USDC and ETH MetaMorpho vaults\n  and allocation and distribution of WELL incentives through the Moonwell\n  MetaMorpho URD contract.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe deployment of Moonwell MetaMorpho vaults marks a pivotal moment for the\nMoonwell ecosystem. Through this collaboration, we are ready to deliver a\nsuperior, risk-optimized lending experience from day one of Morpho's Base\nlaunch. MIP-B21's passage will help to ensure a successful launch, with 50\nmillion WELL tokens allocated for liquidity incentives and a performance fee\nstructure that increasingly benefits the Moonwell DAO as vault TVLs grow. By\nvoting \"Yay\" on this proposal, you are helping to future proof and secure the\ngrowth of the Moonwell ecosystem on Base.\n",

      "title": "[Temp Check] Moonwell MetaMorpho Vaults: Next-Gen DeFi Lending",
      "content": "# [Temp Check] Moonwell MetaMorpho Vaults: Next-Gen DeFi Lending\n\n## Hello Moonwell community,\n\nWe are thrilled to introduce a collaboration opportunity between the Moonwell DAO, Block Analitica, B.Protocol, and Morpho that has the potential to revolutionize the lending landscape on Moonwell. By leveraging Morpho's cutting-edge MetaMorpho protocol, we aim to bring the next generation of optimized lending vaults to the Moonwell ecosystem, offering users unparalleled capital efficiency, flexibility, and risk management.\n\n### Morpho Blue\n\nMorpho Blue is a next-generation lending protocol that is trustless, immutable, and non-upgradable. The entire protocol comprises under 650 lines of Solidity code, which cannot be changed or upgraded, lowering potential surface area for exploits and vulnerabilities. It prioritizes capital efficiency and flexibility, enabling the creation of unlimited risk profiles by externalizing risk management from the core protocol.\n\n**Key benefits of Morpho Blue:**\n\n- **Trustless:** Immutable and governance-minimized ensuring safety and predictability\n- **Flexible:** Permissionless market creation, externalized risk management, and developer-friendly architecture\n- **Efficient:** Higher collateralization factors, improved interest rates, and low gas consumption\n- **Isolated:** Unlike Compound v2, Morpho Blue's lending markets are isolated, enabling safe support for long-tail assets on Moonwell\n\n### MetaMorpho Vaults\n\nMetaMorpho, built on Morpho Blue, is an open-source protocol for creating permissionless lending vaults. These ERC-4626 compliant vaults accept deposits and intelligently allocate funds across Morpho Blue markets, with each vault tailored to a specific risk profile.\n\n**MetaMorpho's key differentiators:**\n\n- Fully transparent, non-custodial vaults with immutable logic and onchain allocations\n- Flexibility to lend across Morpho Blue markets, each with unique parameters\n- Permissionless vault creation, democratizing access for risk managers\n- Layered risk management via clearly defined vault roles:\n  - **Owner:** Sets high-level vault strategy and assigns roles\n  - **Curator:** Defines vault boundaries (markets, supply, and borrow caps)\n  - **Allocator:** Dynamically optimizes yield within set boundaries\n  - **Guardian:** Provides oversight and can veto pending actions in timelock\n\nThis robust role-based system enables continuous optimization and risk mitigation, empowering vaults to deliver the best risk-adjusted yields to depositors.\n\n**Benefits for Moonwell users:**\n\n- ✅ Earn higher yields through optimized lending strategies\n- ✅ Choose from vaults curated to your specific risk appetite\n- ✅ Enjoy peace of mind with battle-tested, transparent risk models\n- ✅ Potential to create isolated markets for long-tail assets that may be too risky for existing Compound v2 markets\n\n### About Block Analitica\n\nEstablished in 2018, Block Analitica is a dedicated risk management firm with extensive experience working with several communities in the DeFi ecosystem. From company launch until today, we have served as the risk management service provider for MakerDAO, where we assist in the management of a risk-mitigated portfolio of collateral backing Dai. Over the course of our years of successful operation, we have expanded our services of bespoke dashboard development and risk consulting to a variety of protocols, including Morpho, Spark, Compound, Aave, Ajna, BadgerDAO, and Delv (Hyperdrive).\n\nSince November 2023, Block Analitica and B.Protocol have collaborated as Morpho risk curators, enabling the Flagship ETH, USDC, and USDT Metamorpho vaults with over $52.9 million in deposits. We have also developed the Morpho Analytics Dashboard to help enhance the risk management and user experience of our curated vaults, as well as the broader Morpho Blue ecosystem. We regularly use the Morpho Analytics Dashboard to monitor risks, review relevant parameters, and alert and present important market changes.\n\nSince March 2024, the Block Analitica team – acting as members of the Stability Advisory Council at MakerDAO – have helped onboard and manage the Morpho Spark DAI Vault. We produced the initial MetaMorpho integration risk assessment and are actively involved in assessing vault risks, managing vault parameters and allocations, and proposing MakerDAO Morpho D3M parameters.\n\n### About B.Protocol\n\nB.Protocol has been building open-source protocols and infrastructure for risk mitigation and assessment for the DeFi ecosystem since 2020. Through our research arm RiskDAO and its novel risk framework, we have supported over a dozen DeFi protocols with risk analysis, research, audits, and monitoring.\n\nWith a focus on automating risk management processes in DeFi, we have developed the Risk Oracle and SmartLTV formula to set and monitor risk parameters for lending platforms in a transparent way, building the next generation of DeFi risk management infrastructure.\n\nTo mention some of our latest development, we have introduced an open-source algorithm for optimizing DEX liquidity aggregation, built a Risk Level monitor for the MetaMorpho Flagship vaults we co-curate with Block Analitica, and lately implemented an auto-Allocator for the flagship vaults, creating the first fully automated smart contract risk manager in the DeFi lending ecosystem.\n\n### Our Proposed Moonwell MetaMorpho Vaults\n\nBlock Analitica and B.Protocol propose to leverage our deep risk expertise and knowledge of the Morpho Blue and MetaMorpho protocols to curate a series of optimized MetaMorpho vaults in collaboration with the Moonwell DAO. Initial vaults will support USDC and WETH, making optimized yield generation effortless for Moonwell users. Our proprietary risk models, stress-tested in production, will power dynamic allocation across Morpho markets to deliver the best risk-adjusted returns with enforceable onchain risk limits.\n\nMoonwell’s MetaMorpho vaults will be accessible through the Moonwell application and as easy to access and use as current Moonwell markets.\n\n**For Moonwell’s MetaMorpho vaults we suggest the following role assignments:**\n\n- **Owner:** Moonwell DAO\n- **Curator:** Block Analitica & B.Protocol\n- **Allocator:** Block Analitica & B.Protocol\n- **Guardian:** Moonwell Security Council\n\n\n### Next Steps\n\nPending the passage of this temperature check Snapshot proposal, here's a high-level overview of our potential launch plans:\n\n- Onchain Moonwell Improvement Proposal vote to:\n  - Deploy USDC and WETH MetaMorpho vaults\n  - Establish vault roles and risk parameters\n  - Distribute initial WELL liquidity incentives\n  - Vault integration into the Moonwell app for seamless user experience\n  - Go-to-market push to drive awareness and bolster liquidity\n\nWe believe this collaboration can set a new standard for optimized, risk-conscious DeFi lending. By combining Block Analitica and B.Protocol's risk management expertise, Morpho's powerful MetaMorpho framework, and Moonwell's ecosystem scale and intuitive interface, we can attract substantial new capital and users.\n\n### Voting Options\n\n- **Yay:** I support the proposed collaboration with Block Analitica and B.Protocol, deployment of Moonwell MetaMorpho vaults, allocation of WELL incentives, and assignment of above roles.\n- **Nay:** I oppose the proposed collaboration, deployment of Moonwell MetaMorpho vaults, allocation of WELL incentives, and assignment of above roles.",

      "content": "MIP-M23 was the starting point for the Governance migration for the new\ncross-chain contracts. This involved several crucial steps for the ratification\nof Cross-Chain Governance within the Moonwell contracts on the Base and Moonbeam\nnetworks. Among these steps was the transfer of admin privileges of the Moonwell\nMarkets on Moonbeam to the new Governor. During MIP-M23, we successfully\ntransferred the admin privileges of BUSD, WETH, USDC, GLIMMER, DOT, FRAX, and\nWBTC with the DAO approval. However, two WBTC markets needed to be transferred,\nand only one transfer was made on MIP-M23. This proposal transfers the admin\nprivileges of the remaining WBTC market to the new Multichain Governor. Despite\na comprehensive line-by-line review of MIP-M23 by the Solidity Labs team and an\nexternal audit, the initial specification did not include this missing transfer.\nTherefore, this proposal is necessary.\n",

2024 01:12:52 GMT\n- **Network**: Moonbeam\n- **Block Height**: 6,136,314\n\nThe submitter (`Curly`), as part of this proposal, will get `15,000 WELL` sent to their wallet at `0x9F94Ff95cbC403cbfC18802eDEAeF71dA8155f36`.\n# Safety Module\nAt the time this proposal was generated there was `417,860,762` **WELL** staked in the **Safety Module**, with a valuation of `$11,423,174.72` (based on a **WELL** price of `$0.027337` pulled from **StellaSwap**).\n\nThis proposal, if executed, would adjust the rewards on the **Safety Module** to <span

**WELL** and `544,037` **GLMR** provided by liquidity providers in the **StellaSwap** **WELL**/**GLMR** pool totaling `$306,710.64`.\n\nThis proposal, if executed, would adjust the rewards on the **Dex Rewarder** <span style=\"color:#FFCF60\">to keep emissions the same</span> and emits `0` **WELL** over the next **28 days**:\n\nCurrent rewards will expire at **Fri, 17 May 2024 03:30:00 GMT**\n\nProposed rewards will expire at **Fri, 14 Jun 2024 03:30:00 GMT**\n\n- Current (estimated APR = `~0%`) days: \n    - `0` WELL / **second**\n    - `0` WELL / **day**\n    - `0` WELL / **reward cycle (28 days)**\n<br><br>\n- Proposed (estimated APR = `~0%`): \n    - `0` WELL / **second**\n    - `0` WELL / **day**\n    - `0` WELL / **reward cycle (28 days)**\n\n# Core Protocol

rewards to incentivize liquidity growth.\n\n**Core**  - Moonwell Artemis lending protocol ([Moonwell: DeFi's Liquidity Well](https://moonwell.fi/artemis)).\n\n**DEX LP**  - StellaSwap’s WELL/GLMR farm ([StellaSwap - Leading Moonbeam DEX & DeFi Gateway](https://app.stellaswap.com/farm)).\n\n**Safety Module**  - Smart contract that allows users to stake their WELL tokens in order to earn liquidity incentives and help backstop the Moonwell protocol.\n\n**Reward Speed**  - The rate at which WELL tokens (on a per second basis) are distributed proportionally to DEX LPs, wallets staking in the Safety Module, and those supplying/borrowing on Moonwell.\n\n---\nConfig Hash: `7da9af6721ed4b1dfab7e2c1579c92aadda5824f3a894b6f3f10daf08ce8492e`\n<details> <summary>Proposal Config</summary> <pre>{\n

      "title": "Moonwell Security Council - Initial Roster Ratification",
      "content": "I would like to propose the establishment of a new Moonwell Security Council and the ratification of its initial roster. \n\nThe ratification of the [Moonwell Security Council](https://docs.moonwell.fi/moonwell/governance/moonwell-foundation/security-council) is a timely and essential step forward as we embark on an exciting new chapter in Moonwell’s journey. The recent launch of the [Moonwell Foundation](https://mirror.xyz/moonwellfoundation.eth/_u03ooO6jbqLJsZ2U1KcKhPQEs9lPpkHtn76ngiNxQA) marks a significant milestone in our path towards continued decentralization and long-term sustainability, empowering our community to drive further innovation and growth. Simultaneously, the successful deployment of the [multichain governor](https://mirror.xyz/moonwell.eth/5Su3-ENerHThkviUbDAP0TLdTzMk5gZ-trkR0WGVNPo) contract and upgraded WELL token have enabled seamless staking and voting on Moonwell Improvement Proposals directly on Base. As we continue to expand our ecosystem and welcome new users, DAO members, contributors, and partners, it is crucial that we have a dedicated group of trusted individuals and entities to oversee the security and integrity of the Moonwell Protocol, DAO, and Foundation. \n\nThe Moonwell Security Council will serve as a unified group of signatories across various mission-critical, security-focused multisigs, such as the Governance Guardians and Pause Guardians. In addition to their Guardianship responsibilities, the Security Council will also play a vital role in reviewing and approving [grant proposals](https://docs.moonwell.fi/moonwell/governance/moonwell-foundation/treasury) submitted to the Moonwell Foundation, ensuring that projects seeking grant funding align with the Moonwell community’s objectives and contribute to the growth and security of the ecosystem.\n\nBy ratifying a single, trusted group of entities and individuals to serve on the Moonwell Security Council, we can strengthen our security posture, bolster incident response time, and ensure that Moonwell operates with the highest standards of security, integrity, and transparency.\n\n## Summary\nI propose the ratification of the initial Moonwell Security Council roster, which will play a critical role in safeguarding the Moonwell Protocol, DAO, and Foundation. The Council will have the authority to take emergency actions to mitigate potential security threats and ensure the smooth operation of Moonwell. This proposal aims to establish the initial roster of the Moonwell Security Council and align the signers across mission-critical Guardian multi-sigs, in an effort to enhance our resilience and readiness to respond to potential security incidents.\n\n## Implementation\nCurrently, the below Guardian roles exist, each with their own specific powers and sets of signatories. \n1. Pause Guardian: Enables signers to pause specific functionality of the Moonwell Protocol. \n- The functions that can be paused by the Pause Guardian role include Mint, Borrow, Transfer, and Liquidate. These can be toggled to the paused and unpaused state by the pause guardian at any time.\n- Pausing the xWELL token or the Multichain Governor contract revokes the pause guardian role, after which a proposal will have to pass to grant the role again.\n- Only through the MIP Process can these functions be reenabled.\n- In the case of an active or potentially imminent security threat, these functions may be paused in order to mitigate any potential loss of funds or bad debt accrual.\n2. Governance Guardian (Break Glass Guardian): Enables signers to return governance back to the governanceReturnGuardian address defined in the [Multichain Governor smart contract](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0x9A8464C4C11CeA17e191653Deb7CdC1bE30F1Af4).\t\n- The initial Break Glass Guardian multisig signers were ratified by the community through a [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.moonwell.fi/#/proposal/0x0869ecb0b960f61e7fa3d47206b81957567afe468672b282b1adaa16470fe5d8) before onchain governance was activated on Moonbeam.\n- This role will be known as the Governance Guardian role going forward.\n- Only through the MIP Process can ownership be transferred back to the multichain governor contract.\n3. Temporal Governance Guardian: Enables signers to pause Temporal Governance if the Wormhole bridge is ever compromised, allowing for a malicious proposal to bypass the MIP Process. \n- The Temporal Governance Guardians were ratified by the community during the Base activation proposal [MIP-B0](https://moonwell.fi/governance/proposal/moonbeam?id=39).\n- When the temporal governor is paused, its 24 hour timelock can be overridden by fast tracking proposals this guardian signs.\nIf this proposal is ratified, the following entities and individuals will serve on the inaugural Security Council. Security Council members will be added to the above Guardian roles and current signatories not serving on the Security Council will be rotated off:\n1. [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/gauntlet_xyz)\n2. [Elliot Friedman](https://twitter.com/Elliot0x) (Solidity Labs)\n3. [Luke Youngblood](https://twitter.com/LukeYoungblood) (Lunar Labs)\n4. [X0s0l](https://twitter.com/x0s0l)\n5. [Coolhorsegirl](https://twitter.com/coolhorsegirl2) \n\nThe newly appointed Security Council members will assume their roles immediately, and their signing authority will be extended across all Governance Guardian and Pause Guardian roles. Those individuals not on the Council will be rotated off. Further information regarding the Moonwell Security Council can be found in the [Moonwell DAO Constitution](https://docs.moonwell.fi/moonwell/governance/moonwell-governance/dao-constitutions/moonwell-dao-constitution).\n\n## Future Makeup\nThe initial Security Council members will serve a single 12-month term. Following this initial term, an open election will take place every 12 months to elect new Security Council members, utilizing the parameters set out in the [Moonwell Foundation Bylaws](https://38185780-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F4535Mbmb8O8Y5q8Xz3cK%2Fuploads%2Fwz8gvC38g46NLu2mB20X%2FMoonwell%20Foundation%20Bylaws%20-%20May%202%202024.pdf?alt=media&token=30289c0c-7909-4e52-8987-375541c7cc85). Community members can nominate themselves, and new members will be added to multisigs while old members are rotated off.\n\n## Voting Options:\n- Yes: Approve the initial Moonwell Security Council roster as proposed and align the signers across all Governance Guardian and Pause Guardian roles.\n- No: Reject the initial Moonwell Security Council roster and maintain the current Guardian/signatory configuration.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe establishment of the Moonwell Security Council and ratification of its initial roster is a significant step towards ensuring the long-term security and resilience of the Moonwell Protocol, DAO, and Foundation. By ratifying the initial roster and aligning the signers across all critical Guardian roles, we can create a strong foundation for effective governance and risk management.",

We consider the minimum daily log returns as\na suitable benchmark for setting Collateral Factor, giving the max CF at ~74%\nhowever, to be more conservative we recommend a starting CF of 0% to test the\nmarket and expect to reach an ideal state with CF of 70%.\n\n**TVL**\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 4.30.57 PM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ6M0whxR.png)\n\nThe TVL of the protocol has grown exponentially to a total of $1.43bn, Aerodrome\nis the largest DEX on Base. Gauntlet deems this TVL adequate to classify AERO as\nan asset that has inherent value/use cases and to be a listable asset on\nMoonwell Base market.\n\n**Supply and Borrow Caps**\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04Fila-16 at 10.20.21 AM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyQSDzngA.png)\n\nBorrow and supply caps are the primary parameter recommendations we can make to\nmitigate protocol risk when listing new assets. Gauntlet recommends setting the\nborrow and supply caps strategically with available liquidity on-chain. There is\nsufficient liquidity to trade up to $20M worth of AERO tokens with a slippage of\n25% signalling a maximum cap setting of 12M AERO tokens. However, we recommend a\nmore conservative supply cap of 6M AERO tokens and 3M AERO tokens for borrow cap\nto bootstrap the market. Gauntlet will continue to monitor these caps and\nincrease them with respect to market demand and liquidity.\n\n**Token Concentration Risks**\n\nAs with governance tokens, there have been incidents (Curve) where large sums of\ntokens were used as collateral to borrow on lending protocols. Gauntlet suggests\nthat such risks can be averted by applying conservative Caps along with using\nthe Herfindahl Index to gauge token concentration across wallets.\n\nThe Herfindahl Index serves as a measure of fund concentration within addresses\non the network, offering insight into the distribution of funds among\nparticipants. In our context, the \"market\" encompasses the total supply held in\nexternally owned accounts (EOAs), while the \"market share\" denotes the relative\nbalance of each address compared to this total supply. Consequently, the\nHerfindahl Index condenses this information into a single value, reflecting the\nextent of token concentration across network addresses.\n\nScoring between 0 and 1, the Herfindahl Index provides a clear indication of\nsupply concentration: higher scores signify significant concentration, whereas\nlower scores suggest a more balanced distribution of funds among addresses.\nSpecifically, it aids in pinpointing tokens where a single entity holds a\nsubstantial portion of the token supply.\n\nOur findings show that excluding major smart-contracts that are of either AMM or\nstaking pools, the HI of AERO is **0.0284** suggesting a more evenly distributed\nownership across the network.\n\n### IR Parameter Specifications\n\n**AERO IR Curves**\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-17 at 10.52.22 AM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkrSguTlR.png)\n\n| Utilization | Borrow APR | Supply APR |\n| ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |\n| 0%          | 0          | 0          |\n| 45%         | 3.15%      | 1.06%      |\n| 100%        | 176.4%     | 132.3%     |\n\nWe recommend an IR curve similar to other assets on the protocols, with a kink\nat 45% and borrow APR of 3.15% at kink.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe addition of AERO to Moonwell Base presents a strategic opportunity to\nenhance the diversity and robustness of protocol asset offerings. The risk\nanalysis by Gauntlet, alongside the strong market performance and liquidity of\nAERO, supports a favorable risk profile. Implementing this recommendation could\ndrive further integration within the Base ecosystem, benefiting Moonwell\ncommunity and stakeholders by providing more options for investment and\ncollateral.\n\n### Voting Options\n\nWe propose the following voting options for the Moonwell community:\n\n- For: Approve the addition of AERO as a new collateral asset on Moonwell's Base\n  deployment with the recommended risk parameters\n- Against: Reject the addition of AERO as a new collateral asset on Moonwell's\n  Base deployment\n- Abstain\n",

      "title": "Add AERO market to Moonwell on Base",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nGauntlet proposes onboarding AERO as collateral on Moonwell Base deployment. Due to the market demand and growth of AERO liquidity on Base we think it is appropriate to list the asset.\n\nThis proposal has been meticulously developed in accordance with our [Moonwell Asset Listing Framework v2](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/moonwell-asset-listing-framework-v2/724), ensuring all critical details necessary for introducing a new asset are thoroughly addressed. Given that AERO is an established asset on Base with robust on-chain liquidity and DEX support, most required data points are readily available and included in this document.\n\nIn line with the procedures established by the Moonwell Asset Listing Framework v2, Gauntlet plans to submit this proposal for a Snapshot signal vote shortly. Should this vote pass, and following the implementation of our initial risk parameter recommendations, Gauntlet will work with other Moonwell contributors to help initiate the AERO market smart contract prior to the on-chain activation vote.\n\n### General Information\n* Asset Name: AERO\n* Address: [0x940181a94A35A4569E4529A3CDfB74e38FD98631](https://basescan.org/token/0x940181a94a35a4569e4529a3cdfb74e38fd98631)\n* Project Description: Aerodrome Finance is a next-generation AMM designed to serve as Base's central liquidity hub, combining a powerful liquidity incentive engine, vote-lock governance model, and friendly user experience. Aerodrome inherits the latest features from its sister protocol Velodrome V2Maybe a second bullet underneath that briefly describes AERO.\n* Token Description: AERO is the native utility token of Aerodrome Finance. Aero holders can vote-escrow their tokens (converting them to veAERO) for up to 4 years to participate in governance and earn protocol fees. \n* Benefits to Moonwell Community: \n  * Expands Moonwell’s stable of supported assets.\n  * Bolsters the synergy between Moonwell and Aerodrome, the top two DeFi projects in the Base ecosystem. This continued collaboration can lead to increased adoption through cross-pollination of user bases.\n  *  Allows WELL tokenholders providing liquidity on Aerodrome to utilize their earned AERO directly on Moonwell.\n* Resources:\n  * [Website](https://aerodrome.finance)\n  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aerodromefi)\n  * [Medium](https://medium.com/@aerodromefi)\n  * [Documentation](https://aerodrome.finance/docs)\n\n\n### Market Risk Assessment \nGauntlet has developed custom risk parameters for the AERO token launch, based on our models and best practices.\n\n| Parameters           | Values |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| CF                   | 0% (Expected 70%)   |\n| Supply Cap           | 6,000,000 ($10,000,000)    |\n| Borrow Cap           | 3,000,000 ($5,000,000)   |\n| Protocol Seize Share | 3%    |\n\n\n\n### IR Recommendations\n\n| IR Parameters    | Recommended |\n|------------------|-------------|\n| Base             | 0           |\n| Kink             | 0.45        |\n| Multiplier       | 0.07        |\n| Jump Multiplier  | 3.15        |\n| Reserve Factor   | 0.25        |\n\n### Supporting Data \n\n**Market Overview**\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 4.01.39 PM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJzBPPhlA.png)\n\n\n|  Metric       |   Value     |\n| ------- | ------ |\n| Market Cap | $675,508,415   |\n| 30D AVG Volume  (CEX+DEX) | $44,710,212  |\n| Circulating Supply | 402,444,318 |\n| Herfindahl Index     |   0.0284          |\n\n\n**Volatility & Max DD**\n\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-17 at 11.02.17 AM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bkgd5Gu6eC.png)\n\nThe maximum and minimum daily log returns for AERO are 65.5% and -26.6% respectively over the past 60 days. We consider the minimum daily log returns as a suitable benchmark for setting Collateral Factor, giving the max CF at ~74% however, to be more conservative we recommend a starting CF of 0% to test the market and expect to reach an ideal state with CF of 70%.\n\n**TVL** \n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-16 at 4.30.57 PM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ6M0whxR.png)\n\nThe TVL of the protocol has grown exponentially to a total of $1.43bn, Aerodrome is the largest DEX on Base. Gauntlet deems this TVL adequate to classify AERO as an asset that has inherent value/use cases and to be a listable asset on Moonwell Base market.  \n\n**Supply and Borrow Caps**\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04Fila-16 at 10.20.21 AM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyQSDzngA.png)\n\nBorrow and supply caps are the primary parameter recommendations we can make to mitigate protocol risk when listing new assets. Gauntlet recommends setting the borrow and supply caps strategically with available liquidity on-chain. There is sufficient liquidity to trade upto $20M worth of AERO tokens with a slippage of 25% signalling a maximum cap setting of 12M AERO tokens. However, we recommend a more conservative supply cap of 6M AERO tokens and 3M AERO tokens for borrow cap to bootstrap the market. Gauntlet will continue to monitor these caps and increase them with respect to market demand and liquidity. \n\n**Token Concentration Risks** \n\nAs with governance tokens, there have been incidents (Curve) where large sums of tokens were used as collateral to borrow on lending protocols. Gauntlet suggests that such risks can be averted by applying conservative Caps along with using the Herfindahl Index to gauge token concentration across wallets. \n\nThe Herfindahl Index serves as a measure of fund concentration within addresses on the network, offering insight into the distribution of funds among participants. In our context, the \"market\" encompasses the total supply held in externally owned accounts (EOAs), while the \"market share\" denotes the relative balance of each address compared to this total supply. Consequently, the Herfindahl Index condenses this information into a single value, reflecting the extent of token concentration across network addresses.\n\nScoring between 0 and 1, the Herfindahl Index provides a clear indication of supply concentration: higher scores signify significant concentration, whereas lower scores suggest a more balanced distribution of funds among addresses. Specifically, it aids in pinpointing tokens where a single entity holds a substantial portion of the token supply.\n\nOur findings show that excluding major smart-contracts that are of either AMM or staking pools, the HI of AERO is **0.0284** suggesting a more evenly distributed ownership across the network.\n\n### IR Parameter Specifications \n\n**AERO IR Curves**\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-17 at 10.52.22 AM](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkrSguTlR.png)\n\n| Utilization | Borrow APR | Supply APR| \n| ------------| ---------- | ----------|\n|      0%       |     0       |      0     |\n|      45%       |     3.15%       |     1.06%      |\n|      100%       |      176.4%      |     132.3%      |\n\nWe recommend an IR curve similar to other assets on the protocols, with a kink at 45% and borrow APR of 3.15% at kink. \n\n### Smart Contract Risk\n* [Github Repo](https://github.com/aerodrome-finance)\n* [Contracts](https://aerodrome.finance/security#contracts)\n* Age of Token: 234 Days\n* Number of token contract transactions: 5,786,593\n* Is it upgradeable?\n  * No, the token contract is not upgradeable. It does not use any proxy or upgradeability patterns.\n\n### Decentralization\n* [Top 10 Holders](https://basescan.org/token/0x940181a94a35a4569e4529a3cdfb74e38fd98631#balances)\n* Privileged Roles:\n     * ”minter” - The address that has the right to mint new tokens. Initially set to the contract deployer, and can be changed by the current minter using the setMinter function.\n     * ”owner” - Set to the contract deployer. However, the owner variable is private and not used in any function, so it doesn't have any special privileges in the current code.\n* Is the token pausable?*\n     * No, the token is not pausable. \n* Does the token have a blacklist?\n    * No, the token does not have a blacklist functionality in the provided code.\n\n### Oracle Assessment\n* Oracle Price Feed:\n  * The official Chainlink oracle price feed address for the $AERO token on the Base network is [AERO/USD](https://basescan.org/address/0x4EC5970fC728C5f65ba413992CD5fF6FD70fcfF0).\n* On what network does the underlying asset exist?\n  * Base\n* Asset Nature:\n   * The $AERO token is not a synthetic, wrapped, or staked version of any underlying asset. It operates independently on the Base network To access more detailed information about the $AERO token's Chainlink oracle price feed, please visit the Chainlink price feed documentation page [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=base&page=1). \n\n### Conclusion\nThe addition of AERO to Moonwell Base presents a strategic opportunity to enhance the diversity and robustness of protocol asset offerings. The risk analysis by Gauntlet, alongside the strong market performance and liquidity of AERO, supports a favorable risk profile. Implementing this recommendation could drive further integration within the Base ecosystem, benefiting Moonwell  community and stakeholders by providing more options for investment and collateral. We recommend proceeding with the onboarding process, following the outlined risk parameters and monitoring the market response closely to make any necessary adjustments in the future.\n\n### Disclaimer\nAs specified in the Asset Listing Framework v2, Gauntlet does not cover smart contract risks or any technical risks. Any of the smart contract or technical risk references or guidelines provided in this document are provided as general best practices by either Gauntlet or the Moonwell community. \n\n### Voting\nFor: Proceed with an MIP to add AERO market to Moonwell on Base\nAgainst: Make no change",

have been allocated for use as rewards to incentivize liquidity growth.\n\n**Core**  - Moonwell Apollo lending protocol ([Moonwell: DeFi's Liquidity Well](https://moonwell.fi/apollo)).\n\n**DEX LP**  - Solarbeamâs MFAM/MOVR farm ([Solarbeam - The DEX on Moonriver, powered by SOLAR](https://app.solarbeam.io/farm)).\n\n**Safety Module**  - Smart contract that allows users to stake their MFAM tokens in order to earn liquidity incentives and help backstop the Moonwell protocol.\n\n**Reward Speed**  - The rate at which MFAM tokens (on a per second basis) are distributed proportionally to DEX LPs, wallets staking in the Safety Module, and those supplying/borrowing on Moonwell.\n\n---\nConfig Hash: `ccbe7cda0aeb7001da2e1b850e36cabbd1ed2284cdc54c6e0f3c8f54de2bb7dc`\n<details>

      "content": "**Authors**: Elliot, Ana\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nThe original proposal was approved but contained an error that prevented\nsuccessful execution on Moonbeam. This issue has been corrected in this\nresubmission. If this proposal passes, the community can expect to have rewards\nenabled for the Safety Module on Base on Thursday.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to activate reward emissions for the new Safety Module on\nBase, incentivizing users to help secure the Moonwell protocol through staking\nand participate in onchain governance.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Moonwell community has recently approved the implementation of a new\nmultichain governor contract to govern the Moonwell protocol. Additionally, a\nnew Base native WELL token utilizing the xERC20 token standard has been approved\nfor usage, which is a significant milestone for the community. By adopting this\nnew Base native WELL token, tokenholders will soon be able to stake their WELL\ndirectly on Base and vote in onchain governance. A new Safety Module has already\nbeen deployed on Base and is registered in the Multichain Vote Collection\ncontract as a source of voting power, allowing users securing the protocol to\nparticipate in governance. Initially, rewards were set to 0 on the new Safety\nModule on Base. This proposal aims to enable rewards for users in the Safety\nModule with the new Base native WELL token.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThis proposal will set and fund rewards that will be distributed to all Safety\nModule stakers on Base. Initial reward speeds will be set to the value\nrecommended by emissions admin Warden Finance of 0.8962755116489610000 WELL per\nsecond. **Voting**\n\nA \"Yay\" vote indicates your support for enabling reward emissions for the Safety\nModule on Base, as outlined in this proposal. A \"Nay\" vote indicates your\nopposition to enabling reward emissions for the Safety Module on Base.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAdding rewards to the Safety Module on Base creates incentives for users to\nbackstop the protocol with the new Base native WELL token. Staking WELL in the\nSafety Module not only gives community members the ability to earn native yield\non their holdings, but also presents an easy way to get involved in governance\nas WELL is automatically self delegated.\n",

      "content": "**Authors**: Elliot, Ana\n\n**Summary**\n\nThis proposal aims to activate reward emissions for the new Safety Module on\nBase, incentivizing users to help secure the Moonwell protocol through staking\nand participate in onchain governance.\n\n**Overview**\n\nThe Moonwell community has recently approved the implementation of a new\nmultichain governor contract to govern the Moonwell protocol. Additionally, a\nnew Base native WELL token utilizing the xERC20 token standard has been approved\nfor usage, which is a significant milestone for the community. By adopting this\nnew Base native WELL token, tokenholders will soon be able to stake their WELL\ndirectly on Base and vote in onchain governance. A new Safety Module has already\nbeen deployed on Base and is registered in the Multichain Vote Collection\ncontract as a source of voting power, allowing users securing the protocol to\nparticipate in governance. Initially, rewards were set to 0 on the new Safety\nModule on Base. This proposal aims to enable rewards for users in the Safety\nModule with the new Base native WELL token.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nThis proposal will set and fund rewards that will be distributed to all Safety\nModule stakers on Base. Initial reward speeds will be set to the value\nrecommended by emissions admin Warden Finance of 0.8962755116489610000 WELL per\nsecond. **Voting**\n\nA \"Yay\" vote indicates your support for enabling reward emissions for the Safety\nModule on Base, as outlined in this proposal. A \"Nay\" vote indicates your\nopposition to enabling reward emissions for the Safety Module on Base.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAdding rewards to the Safety Module on Base creates incentives for users to\nbackstop the protocol with the new Base native WELL token. Staking WELL in the\nSafety Module not only gives community members the ability to earn native yield\non their holdings, but also presents an easy way to get involved in governance\nas WELL is automatically self delegated.\n",

      "title": "MIP-M24: Multichain Governor Migration - Accept Ownership as Multichain Governor",
      "content": "## Overview\n\nMIP-M24 represents the final step in Moonwell's transition to a multichain\ngovernance model, building upon the groundwork laid by MIP-M23. This proposal\nfocuses on the new multichain governor accepting governance powers, completing\nthe transfer of admin and ownership roles from the current governor.\nAdditionally, this proposal will remove the Timelock contract as a trusted\nsender on the temporal governor contract on Base. By finalizing this migration,\nthe Moonwell community will be fully equipped to leverage the benefits of\ncross-chain governance, enhancing scalability and enabling governance\nparticipation across all supported networks.\n\n## Implementation\n\nTo complete the migration to the new multichain governor, the following onchain\nactions will be executed as part of this proposal:\n\n- Accept pending admin of all mToken contracts\n- Accept pending admin of the Comptroller\n- Accept Wormhole Bridge Adapter ownership\n- Accept xWELL ownership\n- Remove old Timelock as a trusted sender on the temporal governor\n\nAfter initiating the contract ownership changes in MIP-M23, it is crucial to\nfinalize ownership transfer to the new multichain governor. By accepting the\npending admin and ownership roles for the mToken contracts, Comptroller,\nWormhole Bridge Adapter, and xWELL contract, the multichain governor will be\nfully empowered to manage the protocol's core components\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe successful implementation of MIP-M24 will mark the culmination of Moonwell's\ntransition to a multichain governance model. By finalizing the transfer of\nownership and admin roles to the new multichain governor contract, the Moonwell\ncommunity will be empowered to participate in the protocol's governance directly\nfrom Base or any other future network, without the need for bridging tokens or\nnavigating complex cross-chain processes. This milestone represents a\nsignificant step forward in Moonwell's evolution, demonstrating the community’s\ncommitment to long-term sustainability and pushing the boundaries of what is\npossible in onchain governance.\n",

      "title": "MIP-M23: Multichain Governor Migration - Transfer Power to New Governor",
      "content": "## Overview\n\nMoonwell currently utilizes Compound's\n[GovernorAlpha](https://moonscan.io/address/0xfc4DFB17101A12C5CEc5eeDd8E92B5b16557666d#code)\nsmart contract, which has been widely used and trusted by many communities over\nthe years for protocol governance. However, its single-chain architecture has\nlimitations that prevent it from offering a seamless, cross-chain experience. As\nthings stand today, WELL tokenholders on Base cannot participate in governance\nunless they bridge their tokens back to Moonbeam. Following Moonwell’s recent\nexpansion, there have been numerous calls from community members to solve this\nUX issue and enable voting and staking directly on Base. To meet this need and\nfuture-proof our governance architecture, my team at Solidity Labs has developed\na new multichain governor that aims to provide a more flexible and scalable\nsolution. This proposal, MIP-M23, is the first of two MIPs required to migrate\nthe protocol to the new governor system contracts. In this proposal, we will\ndeploy the new governor contracts onto Moonbeam mainnet and transfer governance\npowers from the current governor to the new, multichain governor. Shortly\nfollowing this proposal, MIP-24 will be submitted, which will accept ownership\nof the contracts and finalize the new governor’s abilities. By implementing this\nnew multichain governance model, we aim to provide the community with a more\naccessible and intuitive way to participate in the decision-making process,\nregardless of preferred network. This upgrade will not only cater to the needs\nof our growing community, but also solidify Moonwell's position at the forefront\nof onchain governance innovation.\n\n## System Parameters\n\nTo ensure a smooth transition and maintain consistency with the current\ngovernance model, the parameters for this new system are set to be as close to\nthe existing governor’s as possible. However, one notable exception is the\nproposal creation threshold, which has been increased from 400,000 to 1,000,000\nWELL. This adjustment was made to account for the increase in the circulating\nsupply of WELL tokens since the inception of Moonwell Governance in 2022.\n\n### Starting System Parameters\n\n- Quorum: 100,000,000 WELL\n- Voting Period: 3 days\n- Maximum Live Proposals per Address: 5\n- Pause Duration: 30 days\n- Proposal Threshold: 1,000,000\n- Cross-Chain Vote Collection Period: 1 day\n\n### Constant Values\n\n- Minimum Cross-Chain Vote Collection Period: 1 hours\n- Maximum Cross-Chain Vote Collection Period: 14 days\n- Minimum Proposal Threshold: 400,000 WELL\n- Maximum Proposal Threshold: 50,000,000 WELL\n- Minimum Voting Period: 1 hours\n- Maximum Voting Period: 14 days\n- Maximum User Proposal Count: 20\n- Maximum Quorum: 500,000,000\n- Minimum Gas Limit = 400,000\n\nUnder this new multichain governance model, a proposal becomes executable after\na total of four days, with no voting delay. Once a proposal has been created,\nvoting can begin immediately. After the voting period concludes, the cross-chain\nvote collection period begins, during which vote counts from all other networks,\nincluding Base, are tallied. If a proposal reaches the quorum requirement and\nreceives more \"yes\" votes than \"no'' votes, it becomes executable.\n\nThe constant values serve as a floor and ceiling for acceptable system\nparameters, preventing the governor contract from being incorrectly\nparameterized in obviously incorrect ways. System parameters can be adjusted by\nthe community through onchain voting, but the values must remain between these\nboundaries. This safeguard ensures that the governance process remains stable,\nsecure, and aligned with the best interests of the Moonwell community.\n\n## Implementation\n\nOnce the new contracts have been deployed and initialized, it is necessary to\ntransfer governance powers from the current governor to the new, multichain\ngovernor. As part of this proposal, the following onchain actions will be\nimplemented:\n\n- Set pending admin on all mToken contracts\n- Set pending admin on the Comptroller\n- Set Chainlink price oracle admin\n- Set Wormhole Bridge Adapter pending owner\n- Set xWELL pending owner\n- Set trusted sender in Temporal Governor\n- Set the Staked Well emission manager\n- Set the Ecosystem Reserve Controller owner\n- Set the the Proxy Admin owner\n\nBy completing these actions, the new multichain governor will assume governance\npowers over the Moonwell Protocol, enabling cross-chain governance and user\nparticipation from Base.\n\n## Security\n\nMultiple security measures were employed to verify the new code and achieve\ninternal confidence in its robustness. The following are the testing\nmethodologies and security measures employed:\n\n- Static analysis with slither\n- [Extensive unit testing](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/pull/101/files#diff-e25ffc63bb66f53458e2ce5679f04ed4fda78735f6e9ac96d95370f079840ae6)\n- [Integration testing](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/pull/101/files#diff-e918183c66295bd33936cbfb53246b3e209849d595e31e6fb0e027ab842c6208)\n  of the new governor and proposals to ensure ownership of system contracts are\n  handed to the new governor\n- Integration testing of the deployment script\n- Mutation testing to understand the strength of the test suite\n- Formal verification of key governance invariants, ensuring strict minimum and\n  maximum values for parameters are always enforced\n- Multiple internal code reviews\n- A\n  [week-long audit](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/blob/main/audits/Kauz_Cross-Chain-Governance_Audit.pdf)\n  by Kauz Security Services, which found no high or medium issues\n- A\n  [3.5-week audit](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/blob/main/audits/Moonwell_Cross-Chain_Governance_Audit.pdf)\n  by Halborn, which also found no high or medium issues\n\n## Governance Guardians\n\nThe Governance Guardian role, previously known as the Break Glass Guardian,\nserves as a crucial safeguard mechanism within the new multichain governance\nmodel. In the event of an emergency or unforeseen circumstance, the Governance\nGuardian role has the ability to \"break glass” and roll back governance\nownership to a predetermined address, which will be set to the current governor\ncontract. It is important to note that the break glass function can only be used\nonce and must be restored through an onchain governance vote. The Governance\nGuardians will sit on a 3 of 4 multisig. I nominate myself to be one of the four\nGovernance Guardians, recognizing the importance of this responsibility and my\ncommitment to the long-term success and health of Moonwell. The complete list of\nsigners is currently being determined, with a focus on selecting individuals and\nentities who have demonstrated expertise, integrity, and dedication to the\nMoonwell Protocol and community. An additional signer will be added in the near\nfuture to further increase the security of the multisig and ability to respond.\n\nThe complete list of signers is as follows:\n\n1. [Luke Youngblood](https://twitter.com/LukeYoungblood) (Lunar Labs)\n2. [X0s0l](https://twitter.com/x0s0l)\n3. [Coolhorsegirl](https://twitter.com/coolhorsegirl2)\n4. [Elliot Friedman](https://twitter.com/Elliot0x) (Solidity Labs)\n\n## Mutichain WELL (xWELL)\n\n[xERC20](https://www.xerc20.com/) is a token standard that creates a natively\nmultichain ERC20 token. This token enshrines rate limits to bridge providers and\nhas the ability to change, or support multiple bridge providers at will. Through\nthe passage of this proposal, Moonwell will adopt this new token standard,\nallowing for staking and governance participation on Base, as well as any future\nnetwork. At launch, the xERC20 version of WELL, which I will call xWELL for the\npurposes of this proposal, will leverage Wormhole’s General Message Passing\n(GMP) infrastructure to send information on user transfers between chains. With\nthe creation of xWELL, users will be able to participate in governance and stake\ntheir tokens directly on Base, empowering them to actively contribute to the\nprotocol's security and decision-making process from their network of choice.\n\nCurrently, liquidity incentives on Moonwell's Base markets are paid out in the\nWormhole wrapped version of WELL. With the passing of this proposal, xWELL will\nbe introduced as a reward token on all Base markets. Initially, the\nconfigurations will provide users with no xWELL rewards; however, Warden\nFinance, serving as the emissions admin, will have the authority to enable xWELL\nrewards after the next emission cycle concludes in April. From that point\nforward, xWELL will replace the original Wormhole Wrapped variant as the primary\nreward token.\n\n## xWELL Security\n\nThroughout the development of xWELL, a multitude of testing methodologies were\nemployed to foster a high level of confidence in its security prior to launch.\nThe following are the testing and security measures employed:\n\n- [Unit Testing](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/blob/main/test/unit/xWELL.t.sol)\n- [Integration Testing](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/tree/main/test/integration/xWELL)\n- [Invariant Testing](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/tree/main/test/invariant)\n- [Formal Verification](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/blob/main/certora/specs/ERC20.spec)\n  of key system properties\n- A multi-week long\n  [Halborn Audit](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/blob/main/audits/Moonwell_Finance_XWell_Token_Rate-Limiting_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final_Update.pdf)\n  which reviewed the xWELL token and the Wormhole Bridge Adapter.\n\n## xWELL Parameters\n\nThe xWELL token will have the following parameters for the Wormhole Bridge\nAdapters to limit throughput and increase security.\n\n- Buffer Capacity: 100,000,000 xWELL on each chain.\n- Buffer Replenish Rate: 1,158 xWELL per second. This rate is equivalent to\n  100,000,000 xWELL per day and allows the midpoint to be reached within 12\n  hours if the buffer is fully depleted or replenished.\n\nThe buffer depletes on minting, and replenishes on burning. The buffer is\ndesigned to limit the creation of xWELL on each chain, ensuring that the rate of\nminting and burning is controlled and secure. These parameters will likely be\nlowered in the future once the initial token amounts have been moved across\nchains.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe migration to a multichain governance model marks a pivotal moment in the\nevolution of Moonwell. By addressing the growing needs of our community and\nenabling onchain voting from Base, we are taking a significant step towards\nbuilding a more inclusive, flexible, and future-proof governance structure.\n",

      "title": "MIP-M22: Strategic Reallocation of Collateral for FRAX Market Stability",
      "content": "Following the consensus reached in the recent [snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/moonwell-governance.eth/proposal/0xe30b2ec324ad04397eb864dd464d3f57f44c63ccf684c9a126f9dd34908fd5c7) for FRAX market liquidity enhancement, as well as the passage of [MIP-16](https://moonwell.fi/governance/proposal/moonbeam?id=70), we're now ready to move forward with the second and final onchain vote. This plan outlines the next steps for bolstering our FRAX market's resilience and stability by leveraging dormant .mad collateral.\n\n## Proposal Details\n\nThis proposal aims to:\n\n- Transfer all .mad mToken collateral into our community-controlled [multisig wallet](https://multisig.moonbeam.network/settings/setup?safe=mbeam%3A0x949D6a0E3b1064d498D529a388B953b344CD13F7).\n- Clear bad debt from the ledger by reallocating assets and adjusting contract mechanisms.\n\nTo achieve this, two types of mToken upgrades will occur with implementations being swapped out, enabling the smooth transition of assets and ensuring that the exchange rates remain unaffected post-upgrade. Adjustments to the Interest Rate Models may also be necessary to prevent sudden spikes in rates following these changes.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n- mToken Upgrades: Upgrade mToken implementations to allow for the below changes while preserving key protocol invariants and exchange rates.\n- Bad Debt Resolution: Introduction of an [MErc20DelegateFixer](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0x47dffebef33719315bd5a91db6bfb81691347914#code) contract for [mFRAX](https://moonscan.io/address/0x1C55649f73CDA2f72CEf3DD6C5CA3d49EFcF484C) and [mxcDOT](https://moonscan.io/address/0xd22da948c0ab3a27f5570b604f3adef5f68211c3), facilitating the repayment and write-off of bad debts, halting further interest accumulation.\n- Nomad Collateral Reallocation: Introduction of an [MErc20DelegateMadFixer](https://moonbeam.moonscan.io/address/0xf19b9e20c24c8304b89373dec84b7c017e98b4fc#code) contract for .mad mTokens, enabling the seamless transfer of Nomad collateral to the community wallet, safeguarding the system’s balance and functionality.\n\n### Community Multisig Wallets\nTo ensure the safety and security of assets, as described in the [original RFP](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/request-for-proposal-rfp-redemption-and-reallocation-of-nomad-collateral-and-protocol-reserves-for-frax-market-enhancement/746/3), we've created Gnosis Safe multisig wallets on both Ethereum and Moonbeam networks at these addresses with a proposal threshold of 2 out of 3 signers required to execute transactions:\n\nEthereum: https://app.safe.global/home?safe=eth:0x949D6a0E3b1064d498D529a388B953b344CD13F7\n\nMoonbeam: https://multisig.moonbeam.network/settings/setup?safe=mbeam%3A0x949D6a0E3b1064d498D529a388B953b344CD13F7\n\nThe signers of these wallets are trusted Moonwell community members and contributors, including [Curly](https://forum.moonwell.fi/u/curly/summary) and [Elliot](https://forum.moonwell.fi/u/elliot/summary) from Solidity Labs, alongside the Moonwell pause guardian multisig, which ensures a third and final signature should one of the other signers become inaccessible.\n\n### Security Measures\nExtensive security steps were taken to ensure mToken share prices stayed the same and these changes did not have unintended downstream effects or other unforeseen effects on the system. Employed security measures include:\n\n\n- [Integration Testing](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/mtoken-fixes/blob/main/test/integration/proposals/mips/mip-m17/mip-m17.t.sol)\n- [Mutation Testing](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/mtoken-fixes/blob/main/MutationTestOutput/Result.md)\n- [Formal Verification](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/mtoken-fixes/blob/main/certora/specs/SharePrice.spec)\n- Static Analysis\n- Manual code reviews, walking through the code line by line with Solidity Labs engineers\n- Review of changes by one of the founding engineers from Compound Labs\n- [Audit by Halborn](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/blob/main/audits/Moonwell_MToken_Fixes_Audit.pdf), no medium or high issues were discovered in this review.\n- [Code competition by Codehawks](https://www.codehawks.com/submissions/clt7ewpli0001w7f6ol2yojki?page=1&filterValidated=%7B%22value%22%3A%22all%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22All%22%7D&filterDone=%7B%22value%22%3A%22all%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22-%22%7D&filterSelectedForReport=%7B%22value%22%3A%22all%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22-%22%7D&filterSeverity=%5B%7B%22value%22%3A%22high%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22High%22%2C%22disabled%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%7B%22value%22%3A%22medium%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Medium%22%2C%22disabled%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%7B%22value%22%3A%22low%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Low%22%2C%22disabled%22%3Afalse%7D%2C%7B%22value%22%3A%22unknown%22%2C%22label%22%3A%22Unknown%22%2C%22disabled%22%3Afalse%7D%5D&filterTags=%255B%255D&filterCommunityJudgingDecision=%5B0%2C100%5D&filterCommunityJudgingMinVotes=0), this turned up [one medium issue](https://www.codehawks.com/submissions/clt7ewpli0001w7f6ol2yojki/100) our team had not foreseen around rewards not being paid to users with bad debt, however we accepted this issue and will not fix.\nA workaround for this reward issue will be implemented: prior to execution of this successful proposal, claimRewards will be called on behalf of all Nomad bad debt accounts, and any rewards they were entitled to will be sent to their wallet.\n\n### Fund Transfer and Management\nThis proposal will send the underlying .mad assets to the community multisig, however due to lack of support for smart contract wallets for Coinlist’s redemption process, it will not be possible to use the Nomad Bridge with the Gnosis Safe wallet on Moonbeam. \n\nTo address this, Elliot Friedman of Solidity Labs has nominated himself to perform the following steps: \n\n\n- Transfer funds from the Moonbeam multisig to a corporate wallet\n- Redeem the .mad assets for the corresponding underlying assets on Ethereum mainnet\n- Transfer underlying assets to the community multisig on mainnet\n- Use the multisig to swap the underlying assets for FRAX using an aggregator like Defi Llama to determine the best execution price and enforce minimum required slippage parameters.\n- Bridge funds back to Moonbeam through the FRAX Ferry\n- Call repayBadDebt with cash on the Frax market, transferring the proceeds of the redemption to the Frax market, bolstering liquidity, and reducing the bad debt\n\nNote that Elliot is a fully doxxed US person and will be using a hardware wallet from a highly secure computer. The funds will only reside in this EOA for the process of unbridging from Moonbeam to Ethereum.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy approving this proposal, the Moonwell community will take a significant step towards resolving the issues caused by the Nomad bridge exploit, restoring stability and liquidity to the FRAX market, and strengthening the protocol's resilience. The combination of mToken upgrades, .mad collateral reallocation, and bad debt write-offs will help ensure the long term health and sustainability of Moonwell’s deployment on Moonbeam network.\n\nI encourage all WELL tokenholders to thoroughly review this proposal and participate in the onchain vote. Together, we can overcome this challenge and emerge stronger as a community and protocol.\n\n*Please note: Due to the current limitations of the Moonwell Governor contract, which allows a proposal author to have only one Moonwell Improvement Proposal in flight at a time, I have requested that Moonwell delegate Curly submit MIP-M22 on my behalf.*\n",

      "title": "MIP-M21: Upgrade Wormhole Bridge Adapter on Moonbeam",
      "content": "## Overview\n\nIn preparation for the upcoming upgrade of the WELL token to the\n[xERC20 standard](https://www.xerc20.com/), which will enable the token to be\nnatively used on the Base network for voting and staking, the Wormhole Bridge\nAdapter on Moonbeam needs to be upgraded. While the upgraded WELL token is not\nyet in use, it is governed by the\n[Moonwell governor](https://moonscan.io/address/0xfc4DFB17101A12C5CEc5eeDd8E92B5b16557666d),\nso this upgrade must be performed through governance.\n\nThis upgraded Wormhole Bridge Adapter will support a more user-friendly\nexperience by automatically unwrapping the xERC20 version of WELL back to the\n[original Moonbeam native WELL token](https://moonscan.io/token/0x511ab53f793683763e5a8829738301368a2411e3)\non transfer, which will reduce the number of steps required to transfer tokens\nbetween Moonbeam and Base.\n\n## Security\n\nThis change has been audited by Halborn Security as part of the xERC20 upgrade,\nand no security issues were found. The audit report can be found\n[here](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Moonwell_Finance_XWell_Token_Rate-Limiting_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf).\n\nIn order to ensure no storage slot collisions, the slither tool was used to view\nthe storage offset changes in the new logic contract. No storage slot collisions\nwere found, and a single variable `lockbox` was added to the\n`WormholeUnwrapperAdapter` contract, which inherits the `WormholeBridgeAdapter`.\n\n### Wormhole Adapter

not\nsignificantly higher than the old logic contract, integration and unit tests\nwere run to ensure the 300k gas limit was not breached, which would require\nchanges on the base chain to the amount of gas needed.\n\nOn an unwrap transaction, the gas cost `167148` to mint new tokens on moonbeam\non a chainforked integration test, so the gas costs are within the 300k limit.\n",

Definitions\n\n**WELL**  - The Moonwell Artemis governance token\n\n**Liquidity Incentives**  - WELL tokens that have been allocated for use as rewards to incentivize liquidity growth.\n\n**Core**  - Moonwell Artemis lending protocol ([Moonwell: DeFi's Liquidity Well](https://moonwell.fi/artemis)).\n\n**DEX LP**  - StellaSwapâs WELL/GLMR farm ([StellaSwap - Leading Moonbeam DEX & DeFi Gateway](https://app.stellaswap.com/farm)).\n\n**Safety Module**  - Smart contract that allows users to stake their WELL tokens in order to earn liquidity incentives and help backstop the Moonwell protocol.\n\n**Reward Speed**  - The rate at which WELL tokens (on a per second basis) are distributed proportionally to DEX LPs, wallets staking in the Safety Module, and those supplying/borrowing on Moonwell.\n\n---\nConfig Hash: `542cc4480228b4e8dfe32612264a604d86d12db6db2bc97623c25e3fa743cd67`\n<details> <summary>Proposal Config</summary> <pre>{\n  \"_meta\": {\n    \"generatedAt\":

      "title": "Add WBTC to Moonwell on Base",
      "content": "I’m excited to present a proposal for a new addition to Moonwell’s Base deployment: the activation of a WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin) market. WBTC [went live](https://twitter.com/BitGo/status/1762851700413755635?s=20) on Base last week, which presents us with an opportunity to be the first lending application on the network to add support for this popular asset. Our history of seizing the “first mover advantage” with new asset listings for DAI, wstETH, and rETH positioned us well to attract liquidity to the protocol. By also embracing WBTC early, we aim to continue this tradition, enhancing not only liquidity, but the options available to Moonwell’s ever-expanding user base.\n\nThis proposal has been crafted in adherence with Gauntlet’s [Moonwell Asset Listing Framework v2](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/moonwell-asset-listing-framework-v2/724), ensuring comprehensive coverage of essential details required for a new asset listing. It’s important to note that WBTC, being a newly launched asset on Base, currently faces challenges with onchain liquidity and DEX support, making some of the required data points unobtainable (marked with “N/A” below).\n\nAlso in alignment with the processes put in place by the Moonwell Asset Listing Framework v2, I am submitting this proposal for a Snapshot signal vote before proceeding with an onchain MIP. If this Snapshot vote is successful and following the delivery of Gauntlet’s initial parameter recommendations, I will request the assistance of Moonwell contributors familiar with the market deployment process to deploy the WBTC market smart contract before the onchain activation vote.\n\n### General Information\n- **Asset Name:** Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC)\n- **Token Contract Address:** [0x1ceA84203673764244E05693e42E6Ace62bE9BA5](https://basescan.org/address/0x1ceA84203673764244E05693e42E6Ace62bE9BA5)\n- **Project Description:**\n   - WBTC is a wrapped version of Bitcoin, allowing BTC to be used as an ERC-20 token, facilitating its use within the Ethereum / DeFi ecosystem.\n   - WBTC is backed 1:1 by Bitcoin, with [proof of reserves](https://wbtc.network/dashboard/audit/wbtc-base) visible onchain. WBTC on Base is natively minted. WBTC on Base is the first version of the asset to be natively minted on an Ethereum L2.\n   - New Wrapped BTC are minted when a merchant (Wintermute) sends Bitcoin to a custodian (BitGo) and Bitcoin is sent back to the merchant after the Wrapped BTC has been burned. The burned WBTC is deducted from the merchant’s onchain WBTC balance and the supply of WBTC is reduced in tandem.\n\n- **Benefits to Moonwell Community:**\n   - Activating a new market for WBTC would add increased diversity to Moonwell’s range of offerings, potentially increasing user engagement and protocol liquidity.\n   - If we act quickly to activate this market, Moonwell will be the first lending app on Base to support WBTC, increasing our odds of successfully attracting liquidity and new users.\n   - Bitcoin is commonly used as a “store of wealth/value”. Adding support for WBTC on Moonwell will allow users to supply their WBTC to the protocol and eventually borrow against it once liquidity conditions improve.\n- **Resources:**\n   - Official Website - https://wbtc.network/\n   - GitHub - https://github.com/WrappedBTC\n   - WBTC Twitter- https://twitter.com/WrappedBTC\n   - BitGo Twitter - https://twitter.com/BitGo\n   - Whitepaper - https://wbtc.network/assets/wrapped-tokens-whitepaper.pdf\n- **Proposal Author Contact Information:**\n   - Name - Coolhorsegirl (Madison Sinclair)\n   - Telegram Handle - @coolhorsegirl\n   - Discord Handle - @coolhorsegirl\n   - Delegate Address - [0x7F953f11343408eBCcaEcd04eB0D1E6bacDEf87F](https://moonscan.io/address/0x7f953f11343408ebccaecd04eb0d1e6bacdef87f)\n   - Relationship with Token: I am a Moonwell community member and delegate with no direct affiliation with the WBTC DAO or BitGo.\n\n### Market Risk Assessment\n- **Market Cap:**\n   - Total Market Cap on ETH Mainnet: $10,586,706,731.94\n- **Market Cap on Base:** $340.00\n- **Total Supply:**\n   - Total Supply of WBTC on ETH Mainnet: 155,856.0537 WBTC\n   - Total Supply of WBTC on Base: 0.004984 WBTC\n- **Liquidity on Exchanges:** Asset currently lacks DEX support on Base\n- **Proof of Assets:** [Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) an ERC20 token backed 1:1 with Bitcoin](https://wbtc.network/dashboard/audit/wbtc-base)\n- **Volatility:** [N/A]\n- **Average Daily Trading Volume:** [N/A]\n- **Gini Coefficient and Herfindahl Index:** [N/A]\n\n### Decentralization\n- **Token Contract:** [0x1ceA84203673764244E05693e42E6Ace62bE9BA5](https://basescan.org/address/0x1ceA84203673764244E05693e42E6Ace62bE9BA5)\n- **Top 10 Token Holders:**\n   - Holder #1: [0x18c5fb0518c81510e80d4d350bc3a8778c548d6a](https://basescan.org/address/0x18c5fb0518c81510e80d4d350bc3a8778c548d6a)\n       - Amt: 0.004984 WBTC\n- **Privileged Roles in Token Contract:** WBTC DAO manages the WBTC token contract. The WBTC DAO is composed of 13 members that sit on an 8-of-13 multisig. Additional information about WBTC DAO and its members can be found [here](https://github.com/WrappedBTC/DAO).\n- **Pausability:** Yes, WBTC DAO’s [8-of-13 multisig wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB33f8879d4608711cEBb623F293F8Da13B8A37c5) has the ability to pause and unpause the WBTC contract.\n- **Blacklist Functionality:** No.\n\n### Smart Contract Risks\n- **Codebase & On-chain Activity:**\n   - GitHub Repository: https://github.com/WrappedBTC\n   - Age of Token: [118 days](https://basescan.org/address/0x1ceA84203673764244E05693e42E6Ace62bE9BA5#events)\n   - Transaction Count: 4 transactions\n- **Security Posture:**\n   - Audits:\n       - Chain Security Audit - https://github.com/ChainSecurity/audits/raw/master/ChainSecurity_WBTC.pdf\n       - Solidified Audit - https://github.com/solidified-platform/audits/blob/master/Audit%20Report%20-%20WBTC%20%5B11-19-2018%5D.pdf\n       - Coinspect Audit - https://github.com/coinspect/publications/blob/master/WBTC2018v1113.pdf\n       - Bug Bounty Program: [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/bitgo)\n- **Upgradability:**\n   - Is it upgradeable: Yes\n   - Upgrade Process: 8 out of 11 [WBTC DAO](https://github.com/WrappedBTC/DAO) multisig signers must approve upgrade.\n   - Authorized Parties: WBTC DAO members (Kyber, Chainlink, Compound, Balancer, Multichain, BitGo, RiskDAO, Krystal, Loopring, Ren, Tom Bean, Badger, Gopax)\n\n### Oracle Assessment\n- **Chainlink Oracle Price Feed Address:** [0xCCADC697c55bbB68dc5bCdf8d3CBe83CdD4E071E](https://basescan.org/address/0xCCADC697c55bbB68dc5bCdf8d3CBe83CdD4E071E)\n- **Wrapped or Synthetic Asset Details:** Wrapped Asset [ERC-20]\n- **How is the asset wrapped, staked, or otherwise created?:**\n    - WBTC is wrapped, where Bitcoin is held by the custodian (BitGo), and an equivalent amount of WBTC is minted on the destination blockchain (Base).\n    - This process is overseen by a consortium of organizations that act as custodians, merchants, and users within the WBTC network. BitGo is the custodian responsible for WBTC on Base and Wintermute is the first merchant to be onboarded.\n- **On what network does the underlying asset exist?:**\n    - Bitcoin\n- **How can you verify that the amount of the asset that is minted is never more than the amount of the underlying asset that is locked, staked, or used as collateral?:**\n     - The amount of WBTC minted is always backed 1:1 by the amount of BTC locked/custodied. This is verifiable through the “Proof of Reserve” mechanism facilitated by Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.\n     - Chainlink oracles check the balances of BitGo’s WBTC custody wallets every 10 minutes (~Bitcoin block time) and update the onchain data accordingly.\n- Is there a way to verify proof of reserves (PoR) on the same network as the market?:\n     - Proof of reserves for WBTC on Base can be viewed [here](https://wbtc.network/dashboard/audit/wbtc-base).\n- **Please provide an analysis of the price deviation from the underlying asset; ie. over the last 180+ days, how much has the price of the token on centralized or decentralized exchanges deviated from the price of the underlying asset?:**\n    - N/A\n- **What specific events might cause the price to “depeg” or no longer be the same as the price of the underlying asset?:**\n   - Smart Contract Failures - Vulnerabilities or failures in the smart contracts managing WBTC, its reserves, and its burning/minting mechanisms.\n   - Oracle Failure - Chainlink’s price feed for WBTC could go offline, failing to provide the Moonwell protocol with accurate and up-to-date price data.\n   - Operational Failure - Issues with the merchants, custodians, or processes involved in managing the Bitcoin reserves or minting of WBTC.\n\n### Conclusion\nActivating a WBTC market on Moonwell’s Base deployment is a strategic step towards diversifying Moonwell’s product offerings and boosting protocol liquidity. BTC has historically been seen as a “store of value”, making WBTC a perfect candidate to add to Moonwell, as it will give users looking to do more with their Wrapped Bitcoin new options on Base.\n\n### Voting\n- For: Add WBTC Market to Moonwell on Base\n- Against: Make no change",

This follows the asset being de-listed by the asset issuer in 2023. Currently, the BUSD market on Moonwell is in a deprecated status with supplying, collateral and borrows disabled. Suppliers may still withdraw their supplied BUSD if they wish.\n\nWhen the price feed is deprecated by Chainlink, calls to `latestRoundData` will revert, which might cause unexpected results and prevent users from interacting with this market, even to withdraw supplied BUSD. For this reason, Moonwell contributors are recommending that the price feed for BUSD be hardcoded to $1 to prevent calls from reverting.\n\nOur recommendation post is located in the forums, please refer to this [link](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/gauntlet-s-base-moonbeam-moonriver-recommendations-2024-02-28/800).\nBy approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos\n\n",

      "title": "MFAM Token Reallocation for Liquidity Incentives",
      "content": "## Summary\nAs Moonwell approaches its second anniversary on Moonriver, a critical juncture has been reached with the recent exhaustion of the initial 50% of MFAM tokens earmarked for liquidity incentives. These incentives have been fundamental in bolstering [Moonwell's Moonriver markets](https://moonwell.fi/markets/supply/moonriver/movr), [Safety Module](Safety Module), and [DEX farm on Solarbeam](https://app.solarbeam.io/farm). However, with this resource now fully utilized, the DAO urgently needs to settle on a sustainable strategy to maintain and extend liquidity incentives to our users. The suggested solution is reallocating ~20% of the MFAM token supply, originally allocated to [Developer Grants and Incentives](https://moonriver.moonscan.io/address/0x5d6c4dcb86b8a761c062a5274a77aad5f7209aa3), to be utilized purely as liquidity incentives for Moonriver markets, MFAM staking, and the MFAM <> MOVR DEX pool on Solarbeam.\n## Background\nThe Moonwell community on Moonriver is at a crucial point with the recent exhaustion of the originally allocated 50% of the MFAM token supply to be utilized as liquidity incentives. These incentives have played a vital role in the growth and stability of Moonwell's ecosystem, as detailed in the [MFAM Transparency Report](https://medium.com/lunartechfdn/moonwell-apollo-mfam-token-transparency-report-52845c7aed7f). The necessity for ongoing liquidity incentives is underscored by the increasing activity in Moonwell’s markets and the important role that liquidity plays in sustainably fostering a robust and secure DeFi environment.\n\nTo address this, I am proposing a reallocation of the MFAM tokens originally earmarked for Developer Grants and Incentives (transferred during the [MFAM Migration](https://medium.com/lunartechfdn/mfam-token-migration-b13a72963826) in May 2022) to Liquidity Incentives. This MFAM reallocation aims to extend the duration of these incentives for an additional two years. The targeted areas for distribution include rewards for supplying assets to the protocol, providing liquidity to the MOVR/MFAM pool on Solarbeam DEX, and staking MFAM in the Safety Module. \n\nThis strategic reallocation is crucial for maintaining a healthy liquidity pool, ensuring the sustainability and efficiency of Moonwell's operations on Moonriver.\n\n## Rationale\n- **Combat Liquidity Flight:** The risk of liquidity flight is significant if MFAM rewards are depleted. If we do not sustain liquidity, we could face a decrease in protocol usage and community trust. Without incentives, users may withdraw their assets from the protocol, the Safety Module, and the DEX farm on Solarbeam, causing potential destabilization.\n- **Growth Continuity:** Maintaining consistent protocol engagement and expanding the user base are crucial for the long-term success of Moonwell on Moonriver. Liquidity incentives have been shown to attract and retain users, thereby supporting ongoing growth and activity within the ecosystem.\n- **Strategic Resource Utilization:** The proposal to reallocate funds from the Developer Grants bucket is rooted in practicality. Given the minimal grants and development activity on Moonriver to date, repurposing these funds for liquidity incentives represents a more effective use of resources. This strategic reallocation ensures that existing token allocations are leveraged to support the most pressing needs of the protocol.\n\n## MFAM Incentives Campaign Duration\nThe voting options presented to the Moonwell community for the MFAM Incentives Campaign offer different strategies for reallocating MFAM token supply towards Liquidity Incentives. If 20% of the MFAM token supply is reallocated, the options are to make the distribution period 2 years, 3 years, or 4 years. Voters should consider the need for immediate impact versus sustainability when deciding. The final option is to maintain the status quo, making no changes to the current allocation.\n\n## Impact on Token Distribution\n- Adjusted Allocation Post-Proposal:\n- Liquidity Incentives: 70% (including additional 20%)\n- Developer Grants and Incentives: Reduced to 0%\n- Application Development: Unchanged at 20%\n- Team and Advisors: Unchanged at 10%\n\n## Technical Implementation\n- Fund Migration: From Developer Grants and Incentives multisig: [0x5d6C4DCb86b8A761C062a5274a77AaD5F7209AA3](0x5d6C4DCb86b8A761C062a5274a77AaD5F7209AA3) to the designated Liquidity Incentives multisig: [0x45dd368e30c07804b037260071d332e547c874f0](0x45dd368e30c07804b037260071d332e547c874f0).\n## Voting\nAll members of the Moonwell community with delegated MFAM tokens are invited to participate in this vote.\n- Yes: Reallocate 20% of MFAM token supply to Liquidity Incentives over a 2 year distribution.\n- Yes: Reallocate 20% of MFAM token supply to Liquidity Incentives over a 3 year distribution.\n- Yes: Reallocate 20% of MFAM token supply to Liquidity Incentives over a 4 year distribution.\n- No: Make no change.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe proposed reallocation of MFAM tokens marks a crucial step in Moonwell’s journey on Moonriver. I am excited for us to continue to sustain Moonwell by dynamically addressing Moonwell’s highest priority needs, and right now one of those needs is liquidity incentives.",

      "title": "Gauntlet to become Borrow Cap Guardian on Moonbeam",
      "content": "After the approval of the [proposal](https://snapshot.moonwell.fi/#/proposal/0xa8d56b75d35761805c3fbe633057a2484b7094ede0e10e50de78926a8e867add) in July 2023, Gauntlet assumed the role of Supply and Borrow Cap Guardian on Base. This position has been critical in enhancing risk management on Base, allowing for more dynamic and regular adjustments to these important risk parameters. Since the fourth quarter of 2023, there have been 16 changes in the Base parameters, implemented under Gauntlet's guardianship to adapt to these evolving conditions.\n\n\n- **Oct 3, 2023:** Lowered caps for UbSDC\n- **Oct 25, 2023:** Lowered caps for UbSDC\n- **Nov 10, 2023:** Increased borrow caps for USDC\n- **Nov 13, 2023:** Increased caps for wstETH\n- **Nov 17, 2023:** Increased caps for wstETH\n- **Nov 22, 2023:** Increased caps for rETH\n- **Nov 29, 2023:** Increased caps for rETH\n- **Nov 29, 2023:** Decreased caps for USDbC\n- **Dec 6, 2023:** Increased caps for rETH\n- **Dec 7, 2023:** Increased caps for rETH, wstETH, DAI\n- **Dec 11, 2023:** Increased caps for rETH, WETH, wstETH, and cbETH\n- **Dec 18, 2023:** Increased caps for rETH + Provided a no-cap change for DAI\n- **Dec 28, 2023:** Increased supply cap for USDC\n- **Jan 9, 2024:** Increased Borrow Caps on rETH on Base, and decreased Supply caps for DAI \n- **Jan 16, 2024:** Increased Borrow Caps for wstETH and USDC on Base\n- **Jan 22, 2024:** Decreased Borrow and Supply Caps for DAI\n   \n\n\n\n## Borrow Cap Guardians Recommendation\n### Enable Gauntlet as Borrow Cap Guardian\nTo enhance risk management and foster efficient growth within the Moonbeam instance of Moonwell, Gauntlet proposes to serve as Borrow Cap Guardians.  Please note that Gauntlet is proposing to become the guardian only for borrow caps, as there are no supply caps on the Moonbeam instance. This role would enable the Moonwell community to delegate the authority for adjusting caps to Gauntlet. According to the Moonwell technical [docs](https://docs.moonwell.fi/moonwell/protocol-information/technical-docs/the-comptroller/guardian-roles#borrow-cap-guardian), the Cap Guardian function is beneficial for delegating the adjustment of borrow caps across markets to specialists in these adjustments, without granting them full administrative access to the rest of the protocol. As an active community participant with specialization in these adjustments, Gauntlet suggests being appointed as Guardian. The reasons for seeking this guardianship are:\n\n* **Proactive Cap Adjustments:** This role allows us to quickly modify caps in response to market risk events, on-chain DEX liquidity fluctuations, and changes in liquidity pool usage.\n* **Streamlined Process:** It simplifies the voting process and operational procedures.\n* **Expedited Recommendations:** Gauntlet can propose adjustments to borrow caps without the standard 3-day voting period and timelock, enabling faster implementation of cap changes.\n\nIf entrusted with Guardian, Gauntlet commits to adhere to the following limitations when making borrow cap adjustments:\n\n* For each asset, only one increase is allowed every five days.\n* The borrow cap can never exceed 100% of its current value.\n\nAdditionally, Gauntlet will ensure transparency and community engagement by informing the community about any cap changes and providing the rationale through forums.\n\n## Next Steps \n\nPlease vote 'yes' if you agree with Gauntlet becoming the cap guardian on Moonwell. If the community supports this proposal, Gauntlet will integrate an on-chain vote into the next cycle of risk recommendations for Moonbeam.",

      "title": "Moonwell Asset Listing Framework v2",
      "content": "Gauntlet, in collaboration with other Moonwell community members, are proposing the following framework and requirements for asset issuers to utilize when proposing to list new asset markets on Moonwell. To read the full forum post and ask any questions, please visit the forum link [here](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/moonwell-asset-listing-framework-v2/724). \n\n## Background\n\nTo guide best practices in the community, Gauntlet aims to provide a standard framework for assessing market risk when listing assets and enabling assets as collateral, as well as a set of process guidelines for the community to follow when submitting a proposal to list a new asset. Given 2 weeks of notice and strong community buy-in, Gauntlet and Warden Finance will conduct risk assessments prior to new assets being listed, however, these risk assessments are only one step in the process of enabling a new asset. Throughout the asset listing and collateral enablement processes, the goal of risk managers is to ensure that insolvency and liquidity risks are minimized and that when liquidations do occur, that they can be conducted in a healthy and efficient manner, with sufficiently incentivized liquidators. In order to be unbiased, risk managers will not explicitly support any asset listing, but instead provide the below framework as guidance for the community.\n\nTo safely deploy a new asset or market to the Moonwell protocol, other factors must also be considered, including, but not limited to: oracle risk, smart contract risk, centralization risk and ecosystem support. Again, we defer to auditors with expertise in smart contract risk to provide their assessment.\n\n## Asset Listing Process\n\n1. Forum Post: The proposal author submits a forum post titled \"Add [ASSET SYMBOL] market to Moonwell on [Network]\" under the \"[Community Proposals](https://forum.moonwell.fi/c/proposals/community-proposal/19)\" category of the [Moonwell Governance Forum](https://forum.moonwell.fi), providing as much information as possible, including all fields from the “Risk Assessment Checklist” below.\n\n2. Community Check: The Moonwell community verifies the accuracy and completeness of the forum post information provided by the proposal author.\n\n3. Off-chain Signal Vote: The author incorporates community feedback and submits the proposal to the [Moonwell Snapshot Portal](https://snapshot.moonwell.fi/#/) for an off-chain signal vote. The passage of this signal vote will indicate to risk managers that there is sufficient community buy-in to proceed with their risk analysis procedures.\n\n4. Risk Analysis: The Moonwell community, alongside risk managers, assesses and deliberates on the risks associated with listing the proposed asset. This assessment is based on the data provided by the proposal author and the risk managers’ market risk assessment frameworks.\n\n5. Contract Deployment: Following delivery of the risk managers’ market risk analysis and initial risk parameters, the proposal author leverages either the [Moonwell Market Deployer](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/market-deployer) (for Moonbeam and Moonriver networks), or the updated [Market Add procedure](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/blob/main/MARKET_ADD.md) (for Moonwell v2 deployments on Base and other networks) to deploy the market’s smart contracts and generate proposal call data.\nInstructions for using the Moonwell Market Deployer can be found [here](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/market-deployer/blob/main/docs/installation.md), as well as a [sample run](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/market-deployer/blob/main/docs/sample-run.md).

      "title": "Moonwell Asset Listing Framework v2 ",
      "content": "Gauntlet and Community Members are proposing the following framework and requirements for Moonwell markets to utilize when listing new Asset Markets. To read the full forum post and ask any questions, please visit the forum link [here](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/moonwell-asset-listing-framework-v2/724). \n\n## Background\n\nTo guide best practices in the community, Gauntlet aims to provide a standard framework for assessing market risk when listing assets and enabling assets as collateral, as well as a set of process guidelines for the community to follow when submitting a proposal to list a new asset. Given 2 weeks of notice and strong community buy-in, Gauntlet and Warden Finance will conduct risk assessments prior to new assets being listed, however, these risk assessments are only one step in the process of enabling a new asset. Throughout the asset listing and collateral enablement processes, the goal of risk managers is to ensure that insolvency and liquidity risks are minimized and that when liquidations do occur, that they can be conducted in a healthy and efficient manner, with sufficiently incentivized liquidators. In order to be unbiased, risk managers will not explicitly support any asset listing, but instead provide the below framework as guidance for the community.\n\nTo safely deploy a new asset or market to the Moonwell protocol, other factors must also be considered, including, but not limited to: oracle risk, smart contract risk, centralization risk and ecosystem support. Again, we defer to auditors with expertise in smart contract risk to provide their assessment.\n\n## Asset Listing Process\n\n1. Forum Post: The proposal author submits a forum post titled \"Add [ASSET SYMBOL] market to Moonwell on [Network]\" under the \"[Community Proposals](https://forum.moonwell.fi/c/proposals/community-proposal/19)\" category of the [Moonwell Governance Forum](https://forum.moonwell.fi), providing as much information as possible, including all fields from the “Risk Assessment Checklist” below.\n\n2. Community Check: The Moonwell community verifies the accuracy and completeness of the forum post information provided by the proposal author.\n\n3. Off-chain Signal Vote: The author incorporates community feedback and submits the proposal to the [Moonwell Snapshot Portal](https://snapshot.moonwell.fi/#/) for an off-chain signal vote. The passage of this signal vote will indicate to risk managers that there is sufficient community buy-in to proceed with their risk analysis procedures.\n\n4. Risk Analysis: The Moonwell community, alongside risk managers, assesses and deliberates on the risks associated with listing the proposed asset. This assessment is based on the data provided by the proposal author and the risk managers’ market risk assessment frameworks.\n\n5. Contract Deployment: Following delivery of the risk managers’ market risk analysis and initial risk parameters, the proposal author leverages either the [Moonwell Market Deployer](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/market-deployer) (for Moonbeam and Moonriver networks), or the updated [Market Add procedure](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/blob/main/MARKET_ADD.md) (for Moonwell v2 deployments on Base and other networks) to deploy the market’s smart contracts and generate proposal call data.\nInstructions for using the Moonwell Market Deployer can be found [here](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/market-deployer/blob/main/docs/installation.md), as well as a [sample run](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/market-deployer/blob/main/docs/sample-run.md). For Moonwell v2 supported networks, such as Base, the documentation for creating a governance proposal can be found [here](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/blob/main/MARKET_ADD.md).\n\n6. Onchain Proposal Submission: The proposal is submitted to [Moonwell Governance ](https://forum.moonwell.fi)for onchain voting. Upon successful passage and execution of the Moonwell Improvement Proposal, a new market for the proposed asset is activated on the Moonwell protocol.\n\n## Proposal Requirements\n\n* New market proposals must first be posted on the [Moonwell Governance Forum](https://forum.moonwell.fi).\n  * Format the title as “Add [ASSET SYMBOL] market to [Network]”\n  * Post in the “[Community Proposals](https://forum.moonwell.fi/c/proposals/community-proposal/19)” category\n  * Include all “Required Information” listed below\n  * Update forum post with link to live vote\n* On Moonbeam and Moonriver (Moonwell v1) networks, all proposal contract calls/JSON must be derived from the Moonwell Market Deployer output.\n* On Moonwell v2 networks, such as Base, all proposal contract calls should be derived from Foundry and generated using the procedure found [here](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2/blob/main/MARKET_ADD.md).\n* The on-chain proposal must include:\n  * JSON derived from the [Moonwell Market Deployer](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/market-deployer) or calldata generated by Foundry in the [Moonwell Contracts v2 repository](https://github.com/moonwell-fi/moonwell-contracts-v2).\n    * No additional contract calls should be included\n  * Proposal description in Markdown\n  * Link to original forum post\n  * Titled formatted as “MIP-# Add [ASSET SYMBOL] market to [Network]”\n\n## Required Information\n\nThe following information should be included in the forum post when submitting a proposal to list a new asset:\n\n### General\n\n* indicates a required field\n\n* Token Asset Name*\n* A description of the project and the token*\n* Benefits to the Moonwell Community*\n* Resources (Website, Social Media Links, and docs)*\n* The proposal author’s contact information*\n* The relationship between the author of the new market proposal and the token*\n* Social channel metrics (size, activity, and growth)\n\n### Market Risk Assessment\n\n* indicates a required field\n\n* Market cap of the token*\n* Total supply*\n* The largest central and decentralized exchanges where the token is listed and its respective liquidity*\n* Volatility per Gauntlet’s definition https://maker-report.gauntlet.network/int_vol (30 days, 90 days, 1 year) (Gauntlet can also help with this)*\n* Average daily trading volume on CEX and DEX*\n* [Gini coefficient and Herfindahl index](https://insights.glassnode.com/assessing-the-distribution-of-erc20-tokens-on-the-ethereum-network/) of token balances*\n* Emission schedule\n\n### Decentralization\n\n* indicates a required field\n\n* List the top 10 token holders, the percentage held by each holder, and tag them if they are known*\n* List all of the privileged roles in the token contract.

However, this will need to be increased in order to handle the sheer volume of actions that will be required in order to fix the bad debt accounts in proposal 2.

During this proposal, all Nomad reserves will be transferred to the [community multisig](https://moonscan.io/address/0x949D6a0E3b1064d498D529a388B953b344CD13F7).

token\n\n**Liquidity Incentives**  - WELL tokens that have been allocated for use as rewards to incentivize liquidity growth.\n\n**Core**  - Moonwell Artemis lending protocol ([Moonwell: DeFi's Liquidity Well](https://moonwell.fi/artemis)).\n\n**DEX LP**  - StellaSwapâs WELL/GLMR farm ([StellaSwap - Leading Moonbeam DEX & DeFi Gateway](https://app.stellaswap.com/farm)).\n\n**Safety Module**  - Smart contract that allows users to stake their WELL tokens in order to earn liquidity incentives and help backstop the Moonwell protocol.\n\n**Reward Speed**  - The rate at which WELL tokens (on a per second basis) are distributed proportionally to DEX LPs, wallets staking in the Safety Module, and those supplying/borrowing on Moonwell.\n\n---\nConfig Hash:

      "content": "In the nascent ecosystem of interoperable blockchains, where seamless asset movement governs evolution, the emergence of VDOT transcends mere tokenization. Its inherent interweaving with the Moonbeam protocol, via direct integration within the native app, surpasses transactional utility, forging a strategic symbiosis. This synergetic coupling, mirrored by VDOT's esteemed presence on StellaSwap, a pivotal node within the Moonbeam firmament, underscores the mutual recognition of shared values and ambitious visions.\n\nTherefore, with an almost preordained inevitability, VDOT stands poised to join the prestigious consortium of assets supported by MoonWell. Each constituent within this carefully curated portfolio represents a meticulously chosen building block, meticulously woven into a tapestry of opportunity for its discerning user base. VDOT, with its unwavering commitment to the tenets of decentralization, its robust operational architecture, and its thriving, engaged community, epitomizes the very essence that MoonWell seeks to empower and champion.\n\nAdding VDOT is not merely an act of portfolio expansion; it signifies the forging of a potent nexus, a confluence of purpose in the service of progress. For MoonWell users, it unlocks a previously unexplored frontier, an opportunity to harness the multifaceted potential of VDOT within the dynamic Moonbeam environment. Conversely, for VDOT, it grants access to a vibrant, engaged community and a platform renowned for its unwavering dedication to user experience and cutting-edge innovation.\n\nThe inclusion of VDOT within MoonWell transcends the realm of strategic positioning; it orchestrates a symphony of purpose, a harmonious blend of ambition and shared values. This union represents a quantum leap not just for MoonWell and VDOT, but for the broader blockchain landscape, where interoperability and collaborative spirit pave the way for a bright, interconnected future. In this synergistic waltz, both platforms ascend, their combined radiance illuminating the path for others to follow.",

Standard approach - with curly as community signer\n2. Alternative approach - with curly as community signer\n3. Do nothing\n\nBoth options 1 and 2 are beneficial to the overall health of Moonwell's liquidity and we hope to see the community vote for either of these options to restore liquidity to the markets.",

      "title": "Options for Enhancing Liquidity in the FRAX Market on Moonbeam",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal is part of the [Roadmap for the Moonwell Community on Nomad Incident Recovery](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/roadmap-for-the-moonwell-community-on-nomad-incident-recovery/732) recommended by Gauntlet.\n\nThe community has four options to choose from in order the address the liquidity concerns in the FRAX market on Moonbeam:\n\na. Use the remaining Nomad Collateral from Bad Debt\nb. Use Protocol Reserves\nc. Use funds from both options a/b\nd. Take no action\n\nGiven that both the Nomad Collateral and Protocol Reserves are meaningful in size, it may be best for the community to consider using both these sources of liquidity.\n\n## Background\n\nGauntlet has been working with community members to develop a roadmap, informing them about the options available for managing the assets affected by the Nomad exploit and the resulting bad debt. Currently, Moonbeam still holds Nomad assets as reserves and in collateralized positions. Concurrently, the FRAX market on Moonbeam faces outstanding bad debt due to limited on-chain liquidity. Measures can be implemented to recover the value of these exploited funds and use them to improve the liquidity environment of FRAX on Moonbeam. Gauntlet presented several options to help the community in repaying this debt and enhancing liquidity.\n\n### Nomad Collateral available for Redemption\nHere are the total Nomad collateral funds and their estimated value via the recovery refund discount: \n![Screenshot 2023-12-28 at 12.22.02 pm.png](ipfs://bafkreibe6ru6qupjkr3wdyauhxkpqkx3bseady4h735j3vekfikmmktqwe)\n\n*Prices of assets via chainlink as of 2023-12-20 21:59:00 UTC\n\nShould the community decide to take a selection of the nomad assets to exchange them for recovery funds, a community member would undertake the following actions to recover these assets and repay FRAX liquidity:\n\nPropose a Governance vote to transfer Nomad Collateral Funds from the deprecated Nomad liquidity pools to a Multisig wallet:\n\nThe removal of Nomad Collateral will need to be decided by the community, with options being either a reduction in reserves or the potential liquidation of bad debt positions and seizure of collateral.\n\nGauntlet recommends that the Multisig Wallet be controlled by multiple community stakeholders to ensure the security of the assets throughout the recovery process.\n\nThe Community Member responsible for the recovery process will need to follow the Nomad process. The responsible party will need to:\n\n- Complete KYC via the Nomad Recovery Portal 1. This verification can take up to 1–3 weeks for DAOs.\n- Transfer Nomad Assets to the Nomad Recovery Fund via a bridge to Mainnet.\nReceive an NFT.\n- Exchange the NFT for mainnet ETH, BTC, USDC.\n- After receiving the recovery funds from Nomad, the responsible party will need to exchange the assets for FRAX and bridge the assets back to Moonbeam.\n\nThe Moonbeam ecosystem does not have substantial liquidity to swap these assets on their local DEXes. Gauntlet proposes considering the mainnet for asset swaps, due to its generally lower slippage.\n\nCurrently, the FRAX Ferry has 3,952,468 FRAX available to bridge over to the Moonbeam ecosystem.\n\nThe FRAX recovery assets would need to be used to resolve liquidity issues within the FRAX liquidity pool. This can be achieved through multiple avenues but must be decided by the community. The options are:\n\n   a. Use the add reserves function 1 to add liquidity to the FRAX pool for suppliers to remove their position.\n   b. Disburse FRAX to impacted FRAX suppliers.\n   c. Pay down the FRAX bad debt positions.\n\n### Protocol Reserves\nHere are the total Protocol reserve funds:\n![Screenshot 2023-12-28 at 12.23.13 pm.png](ipfs://bafkreidekr52yhbivu33ot3z2u7jqe37ocevh54x5dorwshadlvjlrliei)\n    \n*Prices of assets via chainlink as of 2023-12-20 21:59:00 UTC\n\nFor this option, a community member must undertake the following actions to recover these assets to repay FRAX liquidity:\n\n1. Propose a Governance vote to transfer Protocol Reserve Funds from the listed liquidity pools to a Multisig Wallet for swapping the reserves for FRAX.\n    - The liquidity of DEXes on Moonbeam is a concern. Swapping $54k of GLMR for FRAX could result in approximately 5% slippage. Therefore, it is advisable to collaborate with Market Makers to enhance FRAX liquidity within the local DEXes or to move the assets off-chain to locate more favorable liquidity sources.\n\n2. The reserved FRAX assets would then be used to resolve liquidity issues within the FRAX liquidity pool. Similar to the Nomad Collateral Recovery Funds, the options are:\n   a. Utilize the add reserves function to inject liquidity into the FRAX pool, \nenabling suppliers to withdraw their positions.\n   b. Allocate FRAX to specific suppliers.\n   c. Reduce the FRAX bad debt positions.\n\n**Please note:** This is an initial Snapshot vote to determine which funds (Nomad collateral, protocol reserves), if any, should be used to address FRAX liquidity concerns. If options A, B, or C are chosen, additional governance proposals will be required to determine which community member(s) will handle Nomad asset redemption and swapping, transfer Nomad collateral and/or protocol reserves to multisig, distribution of newly swapped for FRAX, etc.",

      "content": "This is an automated proposal generated by the Moonwell Market Reward Adjustment Tool.\n\n- **Submitter**: Curly\n- **Generator Version**: 1.0.22\n- **Generated At**: Mon, 18 Dec 2023 19:03:02 GMT\n- **Network**: Moonriver\n- **Block Height**: 5,765,386\n\nThe submitter (`Curly`), as part of this proposal, will get `250,000 MFAM` sent to their wallet at `0x9F94Ff95cbC403cbfC18802eDEAeF71dA8155f36`.\n# Safety Module\nAt the time this proposal was generated there was `351,031,606` **MFAM** staked in the **Safety Module**, with a valuation of `$310,155.40` (based on a **MFAM** price of `$0.000884` pulled from **SolarBeam**).\n\nThis proposal, if executed, would adjust the rewards on the **Safety Module** to <span

by liquidity providers in the **SolarBeam** **MFAM**/**MOVR** pool totaling `$112,374.41`.\n\nThis proposal, if executed, would adjust the rewards on the **Dex Rewarder** <span style=\"color:#FFCF60\">to keep emissions the same</span> and emits `5,763,141` **MFAM** over the next **28 days**:\n\nCurrent rewards will expire at **Fri, 29 Dec 2023 03:30:00 GMT**\n\nProposed rewards will expire at **Fri, 26 Jan 2024 03:30:00 GMT**\n\n- Current (estimated APR = `~59.11%`) days: \n    - `2.3823` MFAM / **second**\n    - `205,826.57` MFAM / **day**\n    - `5,763,144.00` MFAM

- Solarbeamâs MFAM/MOVR farm ([Solarbeam - The DEX on Moonriver, powered by SOLAR](https://app.solarbeam.io/farm)).\n\n**Safety Module**  - Smart contract that allows users to stake their MFAM tokens in order to earn liquidity incentives and help backstop the Moonwell protocol.\n\n**Reward Speed**  - The rate at which MFAM tokens (on a per second basis) are distributed proportionally to DEX LPs, wallets staking in the Safety Module, and those supplying/borrowing on Moonwell.\n\n---\nConfig Hash: `5781bba4bc68cbbfb7616004a1a86bcd8e0a3016a664ca8de6a58938dde7fc18`\n<details>

Definitions\n\n**WELL**  - The Moonwell Artemis governance token\n\n**Liquidity Incentives**  - WELL tokens that have been allocated for use as rewards to incentivize liquidity growth.\n\n**Core**  - Moonwell Artemis lending protocol ([Moonwell: DeFi's Liquidity Well](https://moonwell.fi/artemis)).\n\n**DEX LP**  - StellaSwapâs WELL/GLMR farm ([StellaSwap - Leading Moonbeam DEX & DeFi Gateway](https://app.stellaswap.com/farm)).\n\n**Safety Module**  - Smart contract that allows users to stake their WELL tokens in order to earn liquidity incentives and help backstop the Moonwell protocol.\n\n**Reward Speed**  - The rate at which WELL tokens (on a per second basis) are distributed proportionally to DEX LPs, wallets staking in the Safety Module, and those supplying/borrowing on Moonwell.\n\n---\nConfig Hash: `d06f5f90b8e8efe22e1fbe9c4131fff1e43a665e8f5784af59d4c60468377569`\n<details> <summary>Proposal Config</summary> <pre>{\n  \"_meta\": {\n    \"generatedAt\":

More implementation details about incentives/penalties is available over there: https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/penalties/\n\nThe reward, penalty and slashing design of the consensus mechanism encourages individual validators to behave correctly. However, from these design choices emerges a system that strongly incentivizes equal distribution of validators across multiple clients, and should strongly disincentivize single-client dominance.\n\n#### Slashing\nSlashing is a more severe action that results in the forceful removal of a validator from the network and an associated loss of their staked ether. There are three ways a validator can be slashed, all of which amount to the dishonest proposal or attestation of blocks:\n\n* By proposing and signing two different blocks for the same slot\n* By attesting to a block that \"surrounds\" another one (effectively changing history)\n* By \"double voting\" by attesting to two candidates for the same block\n\nCorrelation penalty is incurred when a validator is [slashed](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/slashing/). The penalty amount is determined based on the amount of validators that also get slashed at the same moment. Correlation penalty aims to promote decentralization of validators.\n\n#### Inactivity leak\n\nIf the consensus layer has gone more than four epochs without finalizing, an emergency protocol called the \"inactivity leak\" is activated.\n\nQuadratic leak is a penalty that is imposed upon validators for being offline and missing a slot. The more longer a validator is offline, the steeper the penalty rate is.\n\n#### Insurance\n\nIn order to protect stakers funds, protocols may set up some form of insurance to compensate stakers in case of slashings or offline penalties.\n<hr>\n</details>\n\n#### Correlation penalty risk\n\nSince Rocket Pool ETH relies on a diverse network of independent nodes, it is very unlikely that a significant part of the network gets slashed at the same moment.\n\n#### Quadratic leaking risk profile\n\nAgain here, Rocket Pool ETH is less prone to quadratic leaking penalties since node operators are well distributed and highly diversified.\n\n#### Insurance fund\n\nWhen creating a minipool validator in the protocol, a minimum of 10% of the ETH's value provided by rETH stakers must also be staked in RPL as a security promise to the protocol.\n\nThe insurance promise acts as collateral, where if the node operator is penalized heavily or slashed and finishes staking with less than the 24 (or 16) ETH provided by rETH stakers, their collateral is sold for ETH via auction to help compensate the protocol for the missing ETH.\n\n[Source: Rocket Pool docs](https://docs.rocketpool.net/overview/faq.html#:~:text=RPL%20%E2%80%94%20Rocket%20Pool%20Protocol%20Token&text=The%20insurance%20promise%20acts%20as,protocol%20for%20the%20missing%20ETH.)\n\n### Volatility Risk\n\n<details>\n<summary>About volatility risk</summary>\n\n<hr>\nIn order to maintain solvency, the protocol must ensure that debts are always overcollateralized by assets of a higher value. If debts were not overcollateralized, borrowers would be economically incentivized to default on their debt. Defaulting would lead to the creation of bad debts in the system.\n\nIn order to mitigate asset volatility risk, the protocol enforces liquidations to ensure that debts are always overcollateralized.\n\nTime to undercollateralization measures the time required during a worst drawdown event for a highly leveraged position to accumulate bad debt . The lower the value, the less time is available for liquidators to clear risky positions.\n\nOur methodology specifies a minimum time to undercollateralization of 60 minutes for assets with healthy liquidity levels to ensure sufficient time is available to profitably liquidate risky positions of large size (i.e 20% of supply cap). Goal of this buffer is to reduce the risk of bad debt accumulating.\n\n<hr>\n</details>\n\nThe proposed collateral factor of 0.76 for rETH provides a undercollateralization time buffer of 9,865 minutes (6d 20hrs 24min), which is in line with other LST markets on Moonwell Base.\n\nGiven very low and unstable liquidity levels for rETH on Base at the moment,  the proposed collateral factor aims to leave sufficient time for liquidators to profitably liquidate risky positions of large size (i.e $100k rETH collateral position) in a scenario where DEX liquidity is drastically deteriorated.\n\n<table>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Time to under collateralization analysis\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>rETH</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>cbETH\n   </td>\n   <td>wstETH\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Overcollateralization\n<p>\n(1 - Collateral Factor)\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>24%</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>24%\n   </td>\n   <td>25%\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Liquidation incentive\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>10%</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>10%\n   </td>\n   <td>10%\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Price drawdown tolerance\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>14%</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>14%\n   </td>\n   <td>15%\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Time to undercollateralization\n   </td>\n   <td><strong>9,865 min</strong>\n   </td>\n   <td>10,206 min\n   </td>\n   <td>10,712 min\n   </td>\n\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/81tSUAY.png\" width=\"800px\" />\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LRz5Pz2.png\" width=\"600px\" />\n\n### Liquidity Risk\n<details>\n<summary>About liquidity risk</summary>\n\n<hr>\n\nIf an account collateral ratio breaches the minimum collateral ratio enforced by the protocol, it will become eligible for liquidation. In order for liquidators to be able to liquidate assets at a reasonable price, there must be sufficient on-chain liquidity for liquidators to liquidate accounts profitably.\n\nSlippage tolerance measures the maximum budget allowed for slippage cost when liquidating a risky position during worst downturn events.\n\n<hr>\n\n</details>\n\nrETH circulating supply on Base is very low, with 197 rETH ($433k) currently in circulation. DEX liquidity is also currently not incentivized and concentrated in a single pool on Balancer, so it is very hard to predict how stable the liquidity will be in the short term.\n\nGiven these uncertainties, we recommend starting with a supply cap that is substantially less than circulating supply to avoid outsized positions from joining the market right now while liquidity is sparse.\n\n|Symbol|Circulating supply (Base)|Slippage tolerance|4% depth|Proposed supply cap|Proposed borrow cap|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |--- |\n|rETH|197 ($433k)|4% of seized collateral|$150k|100 ($222k)|50 ($111k)|\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1g9BNif.png\" width=\"600px\" />\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jSuVVAM.png\" width=\"600px\" />\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9EcSG1A.png\" width=\"600px\" />\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dqlYfx9.png\" width=\"800px\" />\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yxzGwC4.png\" width=\"800px\" />\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2uQRfwF.png\" width=\"800px\" />\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/n6ywM3g.png\" width=\"800px\" />\n\n### Oracle Risk\n\nOracle risk is the probability of the oracle price feed not accurately tracking the actual market price.\n\nGiven the lack of historical data for rETH on Base, we’ll assume that skew between oracle and spot price should have a similar behavior than wstETH on Optimism given an equivalent oracle setup (Chainlink wstETH/ETH + ETH/USD).\n\nDuring the last 90d, for a similar oracle price feed on Optimism, 99.7% of observed oracle price skew data points are within [-0.689%, 0.817%].\n\nAs a conservative measure, we’ll assume 1% skew in a worst case scenario for rETH on Base.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ntZjC67.png\" width=\"800px\" />\n\n## Interest Rate Model\n\nThe suggested interest rate model aims to\n\n* Facilitate borrowing rETH considering additional borrowing cost due to staking yield (~3.12%)\n* Attract more suppliers when liquidity risk is high. Higher borrow rates above the kink incentivize borrowers to repay their loans and can attract new lenders in order to maximize liquidity at all times.",

The penalty amount is determined based on the amount of validators that also get slashed at the same moment.\n\nLido is subject to incurring increased correlation penalty due to the relatively large number of validators managed by individual operators.\n\n#### Quadratic leaking risk profile\n\nQuadratic leak is a penalty that is imposed upon validators for being offline and missing a slot. The more often a validator is offline, the steeper the penalty rate is.\n\nQuadratic leak is also a risk factor for stETH due to the lack of diversity in operators.\n\n#### Insurance fund\n\nIn July 2021, the Lido DAO voted to take on self-insurance by allocating a proportion of funds - in the form of protocol fees - for insurance purposes.\n\nThe insurance fund could be used, as an example, to compensate stakers in the case of slashings (or other risk scenarios outlined [here](https://research.lido.fi/t/redirecting-incoming-revenue-stream-from-insurance-fund-to-dao-treasury/2528/21?u=kadmil)).\n\n### Volatility Risk\n\nVolatility can be described as a measure of the amplitude of price changes for an asset over time. Overcollateralized lending protocols like Moonwell are subject to volatility risks. As collateral and debt asset prices change, the collateralization of accounts changes.\n\nIn order to assess robustness of the suggested parameters, we’ll assume a worst case scenario where wstETH asset price drops down as much as the worst 1-hour price drawdown observed for ETH during the last year.\n\nMax drawdown over the last year for ETH is 9.01%.\n\n![|624x224](https://i.imgur.com/PSWWo3O.png)![|624x357](https://i.imgur.com/2OEUMus.png)\n\n### Liquidity Risk\n\nwstETH is not yet launched on Base. We will provide more information once data is available.\n\n### Oracle Risk\n\nOracle risk is the probability of the oracle price feed not accurately tracking the actual market price.\n\nGiven the lack of historical data for the proposed oracle price feed on Base (Chainlink wstETH/ETH + ETH/USD), we’ll assume that skew between oracle and spot price should be similar to wstETH on Optimism given an equivalent oracle setup.\n\nDuring the last 90d, for a similar oracle price feed on Optimism, 99.7% of observed oracle price skew data points are within [-0.689%, 0.817%].\n\nAs a conservative measure, we’ll assume 1% skew in a worst case scenario for wstETH on Base.\n\n![|624x448](https://i.imgur.com/sCHnJJL.png)\n\n## Robustness Test\n\nIn order to validate the robustness of the liquidation incentive, collateral factor and caps our methodology relies on backtesting the profitability of simulated liquidations given historical market conditions. More information about our methodology is available on [Warden’s documentation](https://docs.warden.finance/docs/).\n\n![|624x383](https://i.imgur.com/HH5cWJV.png)\n\nAssuming the following historical market conditions:\n\n|Liquidation cost|% of seized collateral|\n| --- | --- |\n|Max drawdown 60min|9.05%|\n|Slippage|TBD depending on liquidity and caps|\n|Protocol reserve fee|3%|\n|Oracle / spot price skew|1%|\n|Gas fees|0%|\n\nThe buffers necessary for the liquidation to execute profitably can then be determined:\n\n* Collateral factor needs to provide sufficient buffer to cover for\n  * 9.05% drawdown\n  * 10% liquidation incentive.\n* Liquidation incentive need to provide sufficient buffer to cover for\n  * 3% reserve fee\n  * 1% oracle / spot price skew\n  * TBD slippage\n\nGiven above assumptions and liquidation incentive for Moonwell Base deployment set to 10%:\n\n* Collateral factor must be less than 0.81\n* Liquidation incentive offers tolerance for up to 6% slippage cost in a worst case scenario.\n* Borrow and supply caps must be set low enough to prevent users from holding collateral or debt positions that increase the risk for the protocol of accumulating bad debt (>6% slippage when liquidated).\n\nThe suggested collateral factor (0.75) and current liquidation incentive (10%) pass the above robustness test. We will follow up with borrow and supply caps once we have sufficient data to provide recommendations.\n\n### Interest Rate Model\n\nThe suggested interest rate model aims to\n\n* Facilitate borrowing wstETH considering additional borrowing cost due to staking yield (~3.8%)\n* Attract more suppliers when liquidity risk is high. Higher borrow rates above the kink incentivize borrowers to repay their loans and can attract new lenders in order to maximize liquidity at all times.\n\n\n## References\n\n- Warden Finance - wstETH on Optimism dashboard: https://warden.finance/tokens/wstETH?chain=optimism\n- Warden Finance - wstETH on Optimism - Backtesting Simulation: https://warden.finance/liquidation-backtesting/1187eeab-5d90-47fb-8c2f-046ed34bd3e5\n- DefiLlama - LSD Dashboard: https://defillama.com/lsd\n- Rated network: https://www.rated.network/",

`0x9F94Ff95cbC403cbfC18802eDEAeF71dA8155f36`.\n# Safety Module\nAt the time this proposal was generated there was `366,051,298` **WELL** staked in the **Safety Module**, with a valuation of `$1,568,926.35` (based on a **WELL** price of `$0.004286` pulled from **StellaSwap**).\n\nThis proposal, if executed, would adjust the rewards on the **Safety Module** to <span

**WELL** and `820,846` **GLMR** provided by liquidity providers in the **StellaSwap** **WELL**/**GLMR** pool totaling `$343,033.88`.\n\nThis proposal, if executed, would adjust the rewards on the **Dex Rewarder** to <span style=\"color:red\">decrease</span> emissions <span style=\"color:red\">-40.00%</span> and emits `865,385` **WELL** over the next **28 days**:\n\nCurrent rewards will expire at **Fri, 03 Nov 2023 03:30:00 GMT**\n\nProposed rewards will expire at **Fri, 01 Dec 2023 03:30:00 GMT**\n\n- Current (estimated APR = `~23.51%`) days: \n    - `0.5962` WELL / **second**\n    -

      "content": "# MIP-B07: Add Support for USDC Reward Streams\r\n\r\n## Simple Summary\r\nWe are proposing to add support for native USDC reward streams on Moonwell's deployment on Base.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\nCurrently, Moonwell's deployment on Base strictly supports WELL reward streams. This proposed update will bring Moonwell's Base deployment in line with the deployments on Moonbeam and Moonriver, both of which support multiple reward streams (WELL/GLMR and MFAM/MOVR).\r\n\r\nIn the case of native USDC being granted to the Moonwell community to be utilized as liquidity incentives, these new reward streams would allow for suppliers and borrowers on all Base markets to receive USDC denominated rewards.\r\n\r\n### Reward stream will be initialized with following configuration:\r\n\r\n| Market    | Supply emissions per sec (USDC) | Borrow emissions per sec (USDC) |\r\n|-----------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|\r\n| USDC      | 0                              | 1                               |\r\n| USDbC     | 0                              | 1                               |\r\n| DAI       | 0                              | 1                               |\r\n| ETH       | 0                              | 1                               |\r\n| cbETH     | 0                              | 1                               |\r\n\r\n**Note:** that in order to avoid smart contract issues, borrow-side reward speeds must be greater than 0.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, upon the passage of the present proposal, Warden Finance will be granted permissions to set allocations for this new rewards stream as part of the [emissions manager role](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/warden-finance-moonwell-base-rewards-optimization/577).\r\n",

This adjustment is proposed to enhance the capital efficiency of the WETH liquidity pool. \n| WETH IR Parameters   | Current | Recommended |\n| --------------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| BASE            | 0.01       | 0.01           |\n| Kink            | 0.8     | 0.8         |\n| Multiplier      | 0.04    | 0.037       |\n| Jump Multiplier | 4.8     | 4.8         |\n\n\n\n\nPer @Warden's recommendation [here](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/moonwell-base-recommendations-2023-09-11/617/3?u=gauntlet), Gauntlet supports the Jump Multiplier increase to 8.6 for all stablecoins and cbETH IR parameter changes.\n\n| DAI/USDC/USDbC IR Parameters | Current | Recommended |\n| ---------------------------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| BASE                         | 0       | 0           |\n| Kink                         | 0.8     | 0.8         |\n| Multiplier                   | 0.045   | 0.045       |\n| Jump Multiplier              | 2.5     | 8.6         |\n\n\n\n| cbETH IR Parameters   | Current | Recommended |\n| --------------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| Base            | 0.01    | 0           |\n| Kink            | 0.45    | 0.45        |\n| Multiplier      | 0.2     | 0.07        |\n| Jump Multiplier | 3       | 3.15        |\n\n\nHere is the forum [post](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/gauntlets-base-recommendations-2023-10-05/645) with further analysis and supporting data for our recommendations.\n\nBy approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.\n",

While the identified bug cannot result in the loss of user funds, it can potentially cause delays when attempting to withdraw staked MFAM tokens. This proposal suggests a swift transition to an upgraded and audited Safety Module contract that resolves this issue.\n\nMIP-R04 is identical to [MIP-R03](https://moonwell.fi/governance/proposal/moonriver?id=34). Despite garnering approximately 36.7 million 'YES' votes, MIP-R03 failed to reach the required quorum of 40 million total votes cast and was not approved.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nThe need for this upgrade is driven by the Moonwell community’s enduring commitment to maintaining a robust, secure, and user-friendly environment for all users. This bug, although it doesn’t put user funds at risk, could hamper a smooth user experience by introducing undue delays during withdrawal. This proposal aims to promptly resolve this issue with minimal disruption and changes to the underlying contract code.\n\n\n## Implementation\n\n\n### Code Alteration\n\n\nA single line of code has been identified for modification, reducing the likelihood of new issues arising due to this contract upgrade.\n\n\n### Preemptive Measures\n\n\nBefore the submission of this governance proposal, the updated Safety Module contract was audited by Moonwell contributors at Halborn Security. The new implementation of the Safety Module has been deployed and is ready for activation pending community approval.\n\n\n## Voting Options\n\n\n- **Yes:** A “Yes” vote indicates your approval of this Safety Module smart contract upgrade.\n- **No:** A “No” vote signifies your preference for the status quo, no changes should be made.\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\nWhile the identified bug does not put user funds at risk, resolving it is crucial for maintaining a seamless user experience.

      "content": "# Summary\nWarden Finance proposes to manage Aerodrome’s liquidity incentives allocation for the DAO. This proposal is conditional upon the success of the snapshot vote proposing to allocate 52.7M WELL tokens to incentivize Aerodrome DEX liquidity.\n\nThe Aerodrome liquidity manager role would complement our mandate to manage Moonwell Base reward distributions, as well as the risk management and analytics services that we already provide to the DAO.\n\n# Context\nThe Aerodrome liquidity manager is tasked with both managing WELL token incentives on Aerodrome, as well as keeping the Moonwell community informed of performance levels and any distribution changes in order to increase the liquidity of WELL on Base.\n\nThis proposal aims to enable the Warden Finance team as liquidity manager for Aerodrome DEX incentives on behalf of the community.\n\n# About us\nWarden Finance is a team of software engineers and financial analysts that have extensive experience in crypto, finance and software. We specialize in helping DeFi protocols manage risk and surface meaningful data with the help of custom tooling and in depth on-chain analysis. We strive to make DeFi more secure, comprehensible and empower its users to participate along with us.\n\nIn the past years, not only have we been closely collaborating with the Moonwell team, but we’ve also been working with multiple other notable projects and DAOs like AAVE, Compound, Uniswap, Euler, and Notional.\n\nOur biggest contribution to DeFi is our open risk & analytics platform.\n\nWe currently provide bi-weekly analysis of Moonwell’s risk parameters and propose parameters for new asset onboardings to Base in efforts to foster Moonwell’s growth. We believe that we have the right expertise and tools to help the DAO allocate DEX liquidity rewards.\n\n# Proposal\n## Motivation\nOur goal is to maintain deep liquidity levels for the WELL token on Base by allocating the incentives on Aerodrome in the most capital-efficient manner possible.\n\n## Key Principles\n* Quantitative-based approach: Our allocation optimization methodology maximizes capital efficiency by pondering the expected value of each individual strategy.\n* Transparency: Data points along with methodology will be available for the community. We will also provide monthly performance reports to the community and communicate any change.\n## Methodology\nTwo strategies are available to the Aerodrome liquidity manager in order to provide incentives for users to LP.\n\n* Bribing - Bribe veAERO holders using WELL tokens to vote on the WELL / WETH gauge, increasing AERO rewards allocation to WELL / WETH LPs.\n* Direct incentives - Offer WELL rewards to WELL / WETH LPs.\nEvery epoch, our model will determine whether it is expected to be more favorable to bribe veAERO holders or to incentivize the pool directly. If the expected value of bribing is positive, then we will allocate rewards towards bribing veAERO holders to vote on WELL / WETH gauge. Otherwise, we will allocate WELL incentives to directly incentivize LPs.\n\nAdditionally, as a launch partner for Aerodrome, Moonwell DAO may receive a veAERO voting power grant. Should the DAO receive the grant, we will ensure the voting power is directed towards increasing AERO incentives for WELL / WETH LPs. veAERO tokens will be re-locked on a regular basis in order to maintain voting power.\n\n## Scope\nWarden Finance is offering to manage the Aerodrome liquidity incentives for the total duration of the AERO incentives program, corresponding to 2 years or 100 epochs of 7 days.",

      "content": "Following the result of the snapshot “Add more utility to the $well token” where 99.7% of the community said they would like to add more utility to the $well token I would like to start the discussion of some possible alternatives.\nSince there are multiple ideas on how to increase the utility of the well token and we cannot do everything in one-go, the idea behind this snapshot is to choose one to start. My idea is to do this in 2-steps, in a first step the community should choose what’s the best option to start adding utility to the $well token and a second step we will go into more detail with the option that the community selected. We will then create a new snapshot with all the details and logic of the implementation of the option selected, so then someone with technical knowledge can implement it(for that probably we will need support from someone from Lunar Labs, for example Luke). On this 2nd phase I can help with creating some mockups and technical diagrams (user flows, architecture, etc…), since I have a bit of technical knowledge, since I was a developer in the beginning of my career, even though currently I’m a Product Owner in a traditional company.\n\nFind below the options I suggest to increase the utility of the well token:\n-\tTier system : \no\tWe can create different tiers based on the amount of well staked. I suggest 3 tiers:\n\tBase tier : <400000 well\n\tIntermediate tier : >400000 well and <1000000  well\n\tAdvanced tier : >1000 well\no\tIf we are in a lower tier we would receive less rewards when lending and pay more when borrowing, but if we are for example in advanced tier we would receive more rewards and pay less when borrowing\n\n-\tExclusive markets for token holders\no\tWe can expose specific markets for users that are above a certain threshold of staking, or BETA markets with high rewards before exposing them to all the audience. I would suggest above >400000 well, since this is the threshold to create a governance proposal.\n\n-\tOption to stake for 1 year with the possibility of withdrawal.\no\tWe would provide the option of staking for 1year without the possibility of withdrawing the funds. The minimum of staked well should be 400000 well. The advantage of the user is with this option we would give more well rewards compared to the currently withdrawal period (10 days)\n\n-\tNone of the above, I have a better idea\no\tPlease write your idea in the comments\n\nThanks everyone!",

      "title": "Aerodrome DEX Liquidity Incentives",
      "content": "Aerodrome DEX Liquidity Incentives\n\nForum Proposal:\nhttps://forum.moonwell.fi/t/aerodrome-dex-liquidity-incentives/585\n\nSummary\nI propose allocating ~52.7M currently unallocated WELL tokens to be used to incentivize an Aerodrome (DEX) liquidity pool for the WELL token on Base. This allocation will be used to incentivize veAERO holders to vote for this new WELL-WETH pool on Aerodrome, increasing AERO emissions for the pool and boosting useful liquidity for the token on Base.\n\nWhat is Aerodrome?\nAerodrome is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that is launching on Base on August 28th. It aims to be Base’s “central AMM and liquidity layer”. Aerodrome follows in the footsteps of its sister protocol Velodrome on Optimism, which is far and away the most popular AMM on the network, currently holding $203M of the network’s $748M TVL, or Total Value Locked.\nhttps://medium.com/@aerodromefi/introducing-aerodrome-9af62848b876\nhttps://velodrome.finance\n\nHow Does Aerodrome Work?\nAerodrome functions differently than traditional Uniswap v2 or v3 AMMs. Instead of directly adding incentives to a pool, incentives are used to encourage veAERO holders to vote for a specific pool. The more veAERO holders vote for a pool, the higher the AERO emissions (rewards) will be for that pool. AERO can be locked for veAERO and voting takes place on a weekly basis, known as an “epoch”. \n\nBy leveraging this mechanism, the Moonwell community can effectively steer AERO emissions toward this newly established WELL-WETH pool, stimulating liquidity and aligning incentives. This not only attracts more liquidity providers but ensures a more dynamic and responsive liquidity environment for the WELL token on Base.\n\nFor more information regarding Aerodrome mechanics, please visit the Velodrome (sister protocol) documentation page or watch this explainer video.\nhttps://docs.velodrome.finance/liquidity\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjVov4AxZAs&feature=youtu.be\n\nMotivation\nBy creating and incentivizing an Aerodrome liquidity pool for the WELL token, we can encourage LP participation and boost useful liquidity for the token on Base. This initiative aligns with the goals of:\n--Increasing exposure and utilization of the WELL token on Base.\n--Creating additional opportunities for Moonwell community members and WELL token holders.\n--Those providing WELL liquidity to the pool will receive AERO emissions, which can be locked for veAERO and used to vote/direct more AERO incentives to the WELL pool.\n--Decreasing slippage for those looking to swap the WELL token on Base.\n--Leveraging the opportunity to become an Aerodrome launch partner ahead of their August 28th launch date, enhancing Moonwell's standing in the Base ecosystem.\n--Velodrome, the sister protocol of Aerodrome on Optimism, is far and away the most popular AMM on the network. There is a good chance that Aerodrome rises to a similar level of prominence on Base.\n--By creating a pool in time for their Aug 28th launch date, Moonwell will be able to participate in comarketing and be incorporated into their launch announcements.\n\nImplementation Details\n--Allocation: As pointed out in 0xrobinhood’s recent snapshot proposal, 1.05% of the WELL token supply (52,725,802.60 WELL) is currently unallocated, following public sale refunds. \nhttps://snapshot.moonwell.fi/#/proposal/0xe49bdd6e8be600e122c394c3c740e432169252881351f7beb6f3e2c8ede974a9\n--Utilization: This unallocated 1.05% of the WELL token supply will be utilized to incentivize veAERO holders to vote for the WELL-WETH  pool on Aerodrome.\n--This will in turn increase AERO emissions (rewards) on the pool, boosting LP participation and liquidity.\n--Incentives Management: An additional Snapshot proposal will be required to appoint an Aerodrome liquidity manager(s) from the Moonwell community or contributor pool. \n--This person(s) or entity will be tasked with both managing WELL token incentives on Aerodrome, as well as keeping the Moonwell community informed of performance levels and any distribution changes.\n\nVoting Options\n--Yes: A \"Yes\" vote signifies your support for the creation of a WELL - WETH pool on Aerdodrome and the allocation of ~52.7M WELL tokens to be utilized as incentives for this new pool.\n--No: A \"No\" vote indicates your preference for the status quo; no changes should be made.\n\nConclusion\nThis proposal marks a significant and timely opportunity for the Moonwell community, laying the foundation for further growth and an expanded presence in the Base ecosystem. By acting quickly to both establish and incentivize a new WELL-WETH pool on Aerodrome, we can strategically align ourselves with the anticipated Aerodrome launch on August 28th. This alignment should not only increase exposure to Moonwell but also foster greater community engagement. By leveraging Aerodrome’s unique mechanisms, we can bolster useful liquidity of the WELL token, create new opportunities for WELL holders, minimize slippage for those looking to swap, and fortify our standing within the rapidly evolving Base ecosystem.",

      "content": "## Summary\nMIP-B02 is a strategic proposal that is designed to enhance the user experience for those utilizing the WETH market on Moonwell's Base deployment. Currently, those borrowing ETH on Moonwell (Base) receive Wrapped ETH (WETH), with repayments also requiring the usage of WETH. This results in a suboptimal user experience, as borrowers must unwrap their borrowed WETH before utilizing it in the Base ecosystem, and those repaying active borrows need to rewrap their ETH before being able to do so.\n The primary objective of this proposal is to streamline these processes to ensure borrowers directly receive native ETH, thereby eliminating the need for manual unwrapping, and also to allow for repayments to be made in ETH, as opposed to WETH.\n\n## Motivation\nThis proposal aims to improve the UX for those engaging with the WETH market on Moonwell's Base deployment. These proposed upgrades bring about several key advantages for end users:\n1. **Borrows and repayments in native ETH:** Borrowers, individuals redeeming their mTokens, and those reducing reserves within the Moonwell WETH market will now be able to directly receive or repay borrows in raw ETH as part of their transaction process.\n2. **Integrated WETH Unwrapping:** The WETHUnwrapper contract's straightforward functionality ensures that the process of converting wrapped WETH into raw ETH is efficient and transparent. This ETH is then distributed to the relevant end user.\n## Implementation Details\nVarious smart contracts will be deployed as part of and alongside this proposal:\n1. **MWETHDelegate Contract:** This upgrade changes the logic contract for the WETH market to an MWETHDelegate contract. This contract's primary function is to facilitate interactions with the new WETHUnwrapper contract, thereby enabling streamlined operations and improved user experience.\n2. **WETHUnwrapper Contract:** A dedicated WETHUnwrapper contract will be deployed as part of this proposal. The WETHUnwrapper contract is a simple smart contract deployed on Base that the MWETHDelegate contract sends WETH to and then calls unwrap, which converts the WETH into raw ETH and is then directed to the respective user.\n3. **WETHRouter Contract:** Adjacent to this proposal, a new WETHRouter smart contract will replace the currently deployed version. This upgraded WETHRouter contract will empower users to repay active borrows directly in ETH, bypassing the need for manual wrapping into WETH.\nAll new smart contracts associated with MIP-B02 have been audited by Moonwell contributors at Halborn Security. Halborn's latest audit report can be found [here](https://docs.moonwell.fi/moonwell/protocol-information/audits).\n\n## Voting Options\n- **Yes:** A \"Yes\" vote signifies your support for the implementation of MIP-B02.\n- **No:** A \"No\" vote indicates your preference for the status quo, no changes should be made.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn summary, MIP-B02 is a proposal that will dramatically enhance the UX for those borrowing ETH on Moonwell. By deploying the new MWETHDelegate and WETHUnwrapper smart contracts, this proposal facilitates direct ETH borrows and repayments for end users and abstracts away the process of converting wrapped WETH into raw ETH.\nYour support for MIP-B02 will play a pivotal role in enhancing the overall user experience and convenience of borrowing and repaying ETH on Moonwell's Base deployment.",

      "title": "Warden Finance - Moonwell Base Rewards Optimization",
      "content": "# Summary\nWarden Finance proposes to manage and optimize the market rewards allocation on Moonwell’s Base deployment.\n\nThis additional role complements the risk management and analytics services that we already provide to the DAO. This role will enable us to further optimize the protocol’s growth and simplify interest rate model parameter updates.\n\n# Context\nFollowing MIP-B0’s vote and the successful deployment of Moonwell on Base chain, the protocol has been incentivizing markets using WELL. This snapshot indicates that the DAO wants to redirect 217,500,000 WELL from the ecosystem development funds to Base as incentives.\n\nCurrently, changes to the incentive distribution allocation go through governance. Over time these frequent updates will likely lead to governance fatigue and unnecessary overhead. The protocol’s governance contracts allow an admin to make those changes without overloading the governance process.\n\nThe admin role grants permissions to set reward stream settings (supply and borrow reward speeds, reward end and admin) for every market and reward token.\n\nThis proposal aims to enable the Warden Finance team to propose and implement reward emissions changes on behalf of the community based on our rewards allocation framework.\n\n# About us\nWarden Finance is a team of software engineers and financial analysts that have extensive experience in crypto, finance and software. We specialize in helping DeFi protocols manage risk and surface meaningful data with the help of custom tooling and in depth on-chain analysis. We strive to make DeFi more secure, comprehensible and empower its users to participate along with us.\n\nIn the past years, not only have we been closely collaborating with the Moonwell team, but we’ve also been working with multiple other notable projects and DAOs like AAVE, Compound, Uniswap, Euler, and Notional.\n\nOur biggest contribution to DeFi is our open risk & analytics platform.\n\nWe currently provide bi-weekly analysis of Moonwell’s risk parameters and propose parameters for new asset onboardings to Base in efforts to foster Moonwell’s growth. We believe that we have the right expertise and tools to help the DAO allocating incentives on Moonwell’s Base deployment.\n\n# Proposal\n## Objectives\nOur rewards distribution methodology aims to fulfill the following objectives:\n\n1. Help bootstrap new markets: Provide incentives for users to participate in markets that have initially very low liquidity.\n2. Incentivize sufficient liquidity: Provide incentives to attract and maintain sufficient liquidity to allow borrowers to interact with the protocol at scale.\n3. Generate sustainable growth for the protocol: Attract new lenders and borrowers and increase Moonwell’s lending market share on Base.\n4. Minimize friction: Minimize the frequency of interest rate curve updates and minimize the frequency of rewards changes. Previsible updates will help borrowers and lenders to confidently deploy funds to the protocol.\n## Key Principles\n* Quantitative-based approach: Our rewards optimization methodology takes into account specificities of individual markets and adapts to evolving market conditions.\n* Predictability: In order to provide better user experience, our rewards distribution model aims to be as consistent as possible through time.\n* Transparency: Data points along with methodology documentation will be available for the community on the Warden Risk & Analytics platform.\n## Methodology\nIn order to optimize rewards for the above goals, our methodology takes into consideration multiple factors.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreier6634axjerausy52u4uuh63xyupekded3jewimyuo7ckrechmfy)\n    \n### Market utilization and IRM concerns\nThe effective supply and borrow interest curves are determined by both interest rate curve models and reward rates. The resulting interest rate curve aims to maximize borrowing activity while mitigating risks associated with high utilization levels.\n\nWhile interest rate model changes are sometimes necessary for conducting major changes to the curve, reward adjustments offer an additional lever to influence the supply and borrow demand for individual markets.\n\nElasticity (responsiveness of suppliers & borrowers to changes in rates)\nRewards should be allocated to markets where the impact of rewards on supply and borrow rates is most likely to help generate sustainable growth.\n\nFor example, borrowing demand for WBTC and LST assets has historically been very inelastic to rates across most lending protocols.\n\nOn the other hand, demand for lending and borrowing stable assets is usually more elastic to rates.\n\n### Distribution of lenders and borrowers\nRewards may be useful to improve the distribution of lenders and borrowers by attracting new users to specific markets. A more diversified lender and borrower base can lead to more stable rates across time as no individual actor can heavily influence rates.\n\n#### Scale of the market\nReward rates should be set to some extent proportionally to market size.\n\nCompetitiveness with other lending protocols on Base\nIn order to capture market share, the protocol needs to offer competitive rates across different markets. This is especially true for markets that are used for popular strategies amongst DeFi users and are susceptible to attract big volumes.\n\n### Specific considerations for individual markets\nFor example, rewards should be optimized with consideration for specific leveraged yield strategies. This logic can be applied to multiple market pairs.\n\nUnder normal market conditions, we propose rebalancing incentives on a monthly basis. Rewards may need to be changed under exceptional circumstances (i.e significant market movements)\n\n# Scope\nWarden Finance is offering to manage the incentives distribution for the next 12 months, or 13 epochs of 28 days to follow the current Moonbeam and Moonriver schemes. A governance forum post will be put up before each period for discussion and transparency.\n\nAll current and future markets for the Base chain are in the scope of this proposal.",

      "title": "Onboarding the Apollo Community to Artemis (community proposal)",
      "content": "GM Everyone\n\n\n\nVoting Guidelines: 2 Options\n\n-Yes ( Apollo receives [1.05%] (equivalent to 52,725,802.60 WELL) \ncheck the release schedule and eligibility in the proposal.\n\n-No ( please provide feedback, in the comments or Forum )\n\nwe only received 1 Feedback, that was about the price action:) its a bit silly at the day of a big crypto crash.\n\n\n\nIntro\n\nFollowing the recent Multichain incident, the Apollo community discussed possible solutions and further procedures. As everyone knows these are not easy times for the Moonriver ecosystem. Potential solutions take time and depend on many different stakeholders. This is very unfortunate for the Apollo community, because before the first signs of a potential problem with Multichain appeared, Apollo was by far the largest Defi protocol in the Kusama ecosystem.\n\nProposal\n\nThe Apollo community would like to offer the following proposal to the Artemis community. It consists in rewarding the most loyal Apollo members and turning them into Artemis community members and WELL tokenholders. Many Web3 projects struggle to mobilize their Tokenholders for Governance, voter participation is very low and the quorum is only reached at the last moment. Unfortunately It’s no different with Moonwell. That’s why the Apollo community thinks the merger of Apollo and Artemis users is a win-win situation.\n\nTokenomics\n\nI can imagine that many shareholders have a say in the distribution of the tokens and that changes can only be implemented with great difficulty. That’s why the Apollo community studied the Transparency Report closely and found a suitable solution. We have found the following position in the Tokenomics, it is a refund from the public sale event. 1.05% total supply.\n\nNote: this includes adjustments that occurred after the public sale completion, where a total of $1,370,870.87 [1.05%] (equivalent to 52,725,802.60 WELL) were refunded after a public audit revealed ineligible transactions.\n\nSince this refund was not planned and every stakeholder and shareholder expected these tokens to be put into circulation, this has no negative impact if these tokens are subsequently distributed. From our point of view it is a happy coincidence, there will be no changes to the original token distribution and it is a good incentive for the loyal Apollo community to be part of the Artemis world of Moonwell.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe Apollo Community suggests the following distribution:\n\n1.05% equivalent to 52,725,802.6 WELL Tokens are Distributed to $Mfam safety module stakers ( stkMFAM Holders ) with a release schedule of 12months.\n\nEligibility criteria:\n\nHold stkMFAM at Multichain incident MIP 60\nHold at least the same amount of stkMFAM at the time of this proposal # [4898287]\nThe WELL tokens will be distributed evenly among the stkMFAM holders with the balance at the time of MIP60\n\nIn this way it can be ensured that nobody creates an advantage for themselves.\nThe release schedule should also emphasize once again that this proposal is intended to involve valuable community members to Artemis. More criteria can be added as well.\n\nTimeline\n\nThis proposal is open for discussion with the Artemis community. After the discussion period (3-4 days), there will be a snapshot 1 voting for WELL token holders with 2 options YES / NO. And the last step will be an on-chain voting with the WELL distribution to the Claims contract. As far as I know, this step is necessary when transferring out of the treasury.\n\nThere is no timeline for distribution to the Apollo community yet, nor is it the goal to use up unnecessary resources, so our suggestion is to use the resources that are available. For example the already developed 12 month release schedule from the public sale as well as the existing claims.moonwell website.\n\nNotes\n\nMany Dotsama projects are having a difficult time and with this proposal we can motivate other projects to involve the “canary” community more. As mentioned at the beginning, win-win situation.\n\nThere was no airdrop for Apollo users when Artemis was launched, but Apollo users were whitelisted for public sale. Moonwell decided against an airdrop for understandable reasons (not sustainable), but after 18 months one can assume loyal community members\n\nThe Apollo community is very open to offering the same for the Artemis community at a later date and making every Artemis member an Apollo member as well.\n\nthanks for reading, your Apollo community",

      "title": "WELL Rewards for Moonwell’s Base Deployment",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThe activation of the Moonwell protocol on Base, endorsed by the passage of [MIP-B0](https://gov.moonwell.fi/artemis/proposal/39), opens an exciting new chapter in Moonwell's development. The community now faces the strategic decision of determining how to allocate and distribute WELL incentives between the existing Moonbeam deployment and the new Base deployment. This proposal maps out various paths for consideration, placing this important decision squarely in the hands of the Moonwell community. \n\n## Background\nThe Lunar Technology Foundation has allocated [15% of the WELL token supply](https://medium.com/lunartechfdn/well-transparency-report-8dfeb91f5176) (750,000,000 WELL) over 4 years, to be used as protocol rewards to incentivize liquidity providers on Moonwell. These rewards are balanced across Moonwell’s Moonbeam markets through Moonwell Improvement Proposals, based on TVL in each market. The most recent example of such a proposal was [MIP-63](https://gov.moonwell.fi/artemis/proposal/38), which transfers 5,048,077 WELL tokens to the Moonwell comptroller contract, to be rewarded to liquidity providers (suppliers) on Moonwell’s Moonbeam markets over the next four weeks.\n\nAs Moonwell is activating on Base, a reevaluation of WELL emissions is essential to align with the community's preferences and strategic goals. Unlike Moonwell’s deployment on Moonbeam, which also has GLMR rewards, it is unclear whether there will be any ecosystem grants to put towards liquidity incentives on Base. It’s crucial that we act promptly to decide the best path forward for adding WELL liquidity incentives on Base markets.\n\nI have outlined a few potential options for the community to consider and vote upon below.\n\n## Options for Consideration\n**Redirect Unused Ecosystem Development Funds:**\n- 1,467,500,000 WELL or 29.35% of the total token supply has been allocated for Ecosystem Development. \n   - This allocation not only comprises the 15% (750m WELL over 4 years) currently being utilized to incentivize markets on Moonbeam, but also a 10% allocation for developer grants (500m WELL) and 4.35% additional unallocated funds (217.5m WELL).\n\n- The 217,500,000 WELL (4.35% of total supply) has not been utilized and could be allocated towards incentivizing markets on Base.\n   - The main advantage of this path would be that markets on Base could be incentivized more quickly. Other options below will require the passage of a new reward speed proposal like the aforementioned MIP-63, which take place every four weeks. \n\n**Split the Existing 750m WELL Currently Allocated for Liquidity Incentives:** \n- Split based on TVL (Total Value Locked)\n   - Proportionally split the currently allocated 750m WELL between Moonbeam and Base deployments based on the TVL in each network.\n- Fixed Percentage Split: Predetermined ratio of the currently allocated 750m WELL liquidity incentives between Moonwell’s Base and Moonbeam deployments.\n   - 50% to Base and 50% to Moonbeam\n   - 75% to Base and 25% to Moonbeam\n\n## Voting\nThis will be a ranked choice Snapshot vote. Please vote in order of preference:\n- Option 1 - Redirect previously unallocated liquidity incentives\n- Option 2 - Split existing allocation based on TVL\n- Option 3 - Fixed split of existing allocation (50% to Base and 50% to Moonbeam)\n- Option 4 - Fixed split of existing allocation (75% to Base and 25% to Moonbeam)\nBased on the results of this snapshot vote, the option with the highest community support will be implemented, ensuring that the distribution of WELL incentives aligns with the community's desires.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe activation of the Moonwell protocol on Base marks a momentous milestone, ushering in new possibilities and challenges alike. One of the first questions we as a community need to come together to decide upon is what WELL incentives will look like on Base and Moonbeam going forward.\n\nCommunity members are encouraged to engage in open dialogue on the [governance forum](http://https//govformlink.com), participate in snapshot voting, and help shape the future of WELL incentives on Moonwell’s Moonbeam and Base deployments. By placing this critical decision in the hands of the community, Moonwell continues to embody the principles of decentralized governance and community-driven development.",

      "title": "# MIP-B0: Activate Moonwell on Base\\n\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\n\\nFollowing the successful passage of [MIP-39](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/mip-39-activate-moonwell-on-base-mainnet/414), I propose that the Moonwell community vote to authorize the activation of the Moonwell protocol on Base mainnet, upon public launch on August 9, 2023.\\n\\n\\nBase is a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly L2 for decentralized applications and has been incubated by Coinbase in collaboration with Optimism. With the goal of spearheading the next wave of onchain adoption, Base is aiming to create a future of greater financial freedom and inclusivity for all.\\n\\n\\nBy activating Moonwell on Base, we can join in this mission to increase onchain adoption and financial empowerment by bringing our newly redesigned and simplified app to Coinbase users around the world. Base represents a unique opportunity for Moonwell to expand cross-chain interoperability on a value-aligned chain and bring the power of onchain finance to a new generation of crypto users.\\n\\n\\n## About Base\\n\\n\\n[Base](https://base.org/) is a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain developed on the Ethereum network. Since Base operates as an optimistic rollup, it provides substantial enhancements in scalability compared to L1 Ethereum, while maintaining its security from the Ethereum base layer. Following the testnet launch on February 24, 2023, Base mainnet will open to everyone on August 9, 2023.\\n\\n\\nBuilt on [Bedrock](https://dev.optimism.io/introducing-optimism-bedrock/), the first iteration of the [OP Stack](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/fLk5UGjZDiXFuvQh6R_HscMQuuY9ABYNF7PI76-qJYs), Base leverages Optimism's frameworks for scalability and development. The OP Stack is a set of MIT-licensed open-source software that anyone can use or fork and represents a vision for Ethereum scalability and modularity. With standardization and modularity, comes the potential for interoperable L2s including Base to manifest into a larger [\"Superchain\"](https://app.optimism.io/superchain). Base will also contribute to Optimism's [RetroPGF](https://optimism.mirror.xyz/wqk1Yeyn2OhV9paDzbRXvQ0m0JYDu2npbSkMClwk1rY) model, incentivizing the development of the open-source public goods that our digital world relies upon.\\n\\n\\nCoinbase is a proven leader in the digital asset space. After publicizing its onchain ambitions nearly 7 years ago in their \"[Secret Master Plan](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/the-coinbase-secret-master-plan),\" Base's release marks the next milestone towards realizing its goal of creating a financial system consisting of decentralized applications on an open and globally accessible network with a user base of one billion people.\\n\\n\\n## Motivation\\n\\n\\nActivating Moonwell on Base mainnet offers a number of benefits to the Moonwell community, including opportunities to:\\n\\n\\n1. Expand cross-chain interoperability\\n2. Unlock a massive target audience, Coinbase users\\n3. Build on shared values\\n\\n\\n**Expand cross-chain interoperability**\\n\\n\\nThe launch of Base offers an opportunity to connect the entire Dotsama ecosystem with Ethereum in a way that wasn't possible before. The Moonwell protocol now has the capability of going cross-chain and bringing the best assets from the ecosystem to millions of Coinbase users, including GLMR and DOT.\\n\\n\\nSince the Moonwell community first activated Moonwell over 18 months ago, we have pursued the goal of connecting the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems to the world of onchain finance. The Moonwell community also shares the Moonbeam vision of [connected smart contracts](https://twitter.com/MoonbeamNetwork/status/1624079104227282945?s=20) with EVM as the base layer. This vision is supported by the cross-chain integrations and features available on Moonbeam, like the Wormhole message passing protocol, which allows for Moonwell to expand to Base, reaching even more people.\\n\\n\\n**Unlock a massive target audience, Coinbase users**\\n\\n\\nBase represents a massive target audience for Moonwell — Coinbase's millions of verified users. Coinbase's retail mobile app now includes a \"web3\" tab that enables Coinbase users to easily interact with onchain apps like Moonwell and move assets across the ecosystem.\\n\\n\\nActivating Moonwell on Base represents an opportunity to expose up to 110m users to the world of onchain finance and familiarize them with our existing activations on Moonbeam and Moonriver. As one of the first projects to activate on Base, Moonwell will enjoy early mover benefits (specifically in attracting sufficient liquidity) and join a community of web3 giants like Sushiswap, Chainlink, Balancer, and Wormhole.\\n\\n\\n**Build on shared values**\\n\\n\\nWith the unveiling of Moonwell's newly redesigned and streamlined app, the Moonwell community has reaffirmed its commitment to inclusivity and accessibility. These values are aligned with the Base ethos of \"Base is for everyone\" and Coinbase's long-held desire to create an open and global cryptoeconomy.\\n\\n\\nOur intuitive, user-friendly app has been designed to break down the barriers that have historically made DeFi seem complex and intimidating to many. By bringing the new Moonwell app to Base, we can help to increase financial freedom throughout the world and empower the next generation of onchain adopters.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Implementation\\n\\n\\nThe implementation of this proposal is comprised of the following steps: (Note that due to the cross-chain nature of this proposal, the governance portal doesn't currently display each individual step)\\n\\n\\n1. **Accepting Admin on Moonwell Base Contracts:**\\n- Invoke the acceptAdmin function on Moonwell's Base contracts, assigning governance rights to the Moonwell Temporal Governor.\\n    1. Similar privileges are assigned to GovernorAlpha on Moonwell's Moonbeam and Moonriver deployments.\\n2. **Setting Borrow and Supply Cap Guardian:**\\n- In alignment with Gauntlet's \"[Initial Recommendations for Moonwell on Base and Cap Guardianship](https://snapshot.moonwell.fi/#/proposal/0xa8d56b75d35761805c3fbe633057a2484b7094ede0e10e50de78926a8e867add)\" Snapshot proposal, Gauntlet's multisig address will be assigned borrow and supply cap guardianship.\\n- This new role allows for Gauntlet to promptly modify borrow and supply caps in response to market risk events, onchain DEX liquidity fluctuations, and changes in liquidity pool usage.\\n- Gauntlet's borrow and supply cap guardianship will only be enacted for Moonwell's deployment on Base. More information can be found in [this forum post](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/gauntlets-initial-recommendations-for-moonwell-on-base/536/4).\\n3. **Unpausing Mint on Moonwell's Base Markets:**\\n- The mint function will be unpaused on Moonwell's Base markets.\\n- The markets supported at launch are: ETH, USDC (USDbC), and cbETH.\\n- This will enable users to supply or deposit assets into these new markets once the proposal has been executed on Base.\\n4. **Minting mTokens to address a potential \"Hundred Finance\" exploit:**\\n- A small quantity of mTokens (Moonwell collateral tokens) will be minted and transferred to a designated burn address.\\n- This proactive measure is intended to mitigate any potential risks associated with the [Hundred Finance exchange rate exploit](https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-hundred-finance-hack-april-2023).\\n5. **Establishing Governance Guardians:**\\n- Introduction of Moonwell Governance Guardians as a protective measure, having discrete powers to halt Temporal Governance if an illegitimate proposal is queued into the Wormhole timelock.\\n- This role will be supported by a multisig, requiring three of the five Governance Guardians to pause Temporal Governance.\\n    1. The Governance Guardian multisig has been created and can be viewed [here](https://app.safe.global/home?safe=base:0x446342AF4F3bCD374276891C6bb3411bf2F8779E)\\n\\n\\n### Moonwell Governance Guardians\\n\\n\\nMoonwell's Base deployment is designed to be governed by WELL token holders from Moonbeam Network. This innovative approach is facilitated by Temporal Governance, which enables cross-chain governance via the Wormhole message passing protocol.\\n\\n\\n- **Temporal Governance:**\\n- A newly developed and [audited](https://github.com/HalbornSecurity/PublicReports/blob/master/Solidity%20Smart%20Contract%20Audits/Moonwell_Finance_Contracts_V2_Smart_Contract_Security_Assessment_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf) contract that leverages the Wormhole protocol.\\n- Facilitates cross-chain verification and execution of Moonwell Improvement Proposals on Base.\\n- **Timelock Requirement:**\\n- An additional 24-hour timelock is imposed after a proposal's successful passage on Moonbeam before it may be executed on Base.\\n- This timelock period enables the [Wormhole Guardians](https://wormholecrypto.medium.com/wormhole-guardians-everstake-83afb735cddd) to confirm that the proposal was indeed successful, providing an extra layer of security and validation.\\n\\n\\n- **Governance Guardian Role:**\\n- Proposed as a safeguard against potential exploitation of the Wormhole bridge or compromise of the Wormhole Guardians.\\n- The Moonwell Governance Guardian role will have limited powers, including:\\n    - Pausing Temporal Governance to prevent a malicious, queued proposal from executing on Base.\\n    - Executing a valid, successful proposal while Temporal Governance is paused.\\n- The Moonwell Governance Guardian multisig will require 3 of the 5 Governance Guardians to agree in order to pause Temporal Governance or execute a valid proposal.\\n- If Temporal Governance is ever paused:\\n    - Governance Guardians cannot unpause. A Moonwell Improvement Proposal will be required to unpause Temporal Governance.\\n    - Governance Guardians will be unable to pause Temporal Governance again until a new Moonwell Improvement Proposal reassigns the Governance Guardian role.\\n    - Temporal governance can be permissionlessly unpaused after a significant time delay of 30 days, mitigating the risk of a malicious or prolonged pause.\\n- The Moonwell community is able to vote to revoke Moonwell Governance Guardianship through the passage of a Moonwell Improvement Proposal.\\n\\n\\n**TLDR:** The Governance Guardian role only exists in case Wormhole is attacked and the attacker submits a proposal that DID NOT successfully pass Moonwell governance. In that rare event, the guardians can pause within 24 hours to prevent the attack from taking place.\\n\\n\\nThe following Moonwell contributors and community members have generously volunteered to be the initial set of Moonwell Governance Guardians:\\n\\n\\n- [Gauntlet](https://twitter.com/gauntlet_xyz)\\n- [Warden](https://twitter.com/warden_finance)\\n- [Brandon Kase](https://twitter.com/bkase_)\\n- [X0s0l](https://twitter.com/x0s0l)\\n- [Coolhorsegirl](https://twitter.com/coolhorsegirl2)\\n\\n\\n## **Voting**\\n\\n\\nThe decision to activate Moonwell on Base is a significant one and I strongly encourage every Moonwell community member to vote:\\n\\n\\n- **Yes:** By voting \"Yes,\" you are supporting the activation of Moonwell on Base mainnet, the creation of the Moonwell Governance Guardian role, the unpausing (to activate) Moonwell markets on Base, the burning of mTokens to prevent a \"Hundred Finance\" style exploit, and the designation of Gauntlet as borrow and supply cap guardian.\\n- **No:** By voting \"No,\" you are signaling that you prefer the Moonwell protocol to remain as is, without activating on the Base mainnet at this time.\\n\\n\\n## **Conclusion**\\n\\n\\nActivating the Moonwell protocol on Base is a crucial step towards broadening and developing the Moonwell community and bringing easy-to-use onchain finance to Coinbase users around the world. The prospect of enhancing Moonwell's accessibility and linking the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems to Ethereum through Moonwell's Base deployment, particularly at this early stage, is so exciting.\\n\\n\\nIn short, activating Moonwell on Base provides a can't-miss opportunity to boost cross-chain interoperability and expand our global community. We will have the opportunity to bring the power of onchain finance to new users around the world while remaining firmly rooted in our core values of security, transparency, and decentralization.\\n",

      "title": "Gauntlet's Initial Recommendations for Moonwell on BASE and Cap Gaurdianship",
      "content": "# Summary\nThis is a snapshot proposal for Gauntlet's Initial Recommendations for Moonwell on Base and to become Suppy/Borrow Cap Guardians. Here is a [link](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/gauntlets-initial-recommendations-for-moonwell-on-base/536) to the forum post. Gauntlet will propose four risk recommendations in this forum regarding the Base protocol under one snapshot vote in which we will have the following options:\n\n- Risk averse w/ Supply/Borrow Cap Guardian\n- Risk tolerant w/ Supply/Borrow Cap Guardian\n- Risk averse w/o Supply/Borrow Cap Guardian\n- Risk tolerant w/o Supply/Borrow Cap Guardian\n\nWe have coalesced our Asset Risk tolerance and Gauntlet's Guardian proposal under one snapshot to simplify the voting process and provide clear next steps. By utilizing a cap guardian role, the community is better suited to optimize for capital efficiency and risk. Gauntlet has provided cap recs for Artemis and Apollo for 10+ months, and we are excited to continue supporting Moonwell for the BASE launch. **Gauntlet recommends becoming a Supply/Borrow Cap Guardian.**\n\n\n# Asset Recommendations\n\nRegarding the initial listing of assets on the Base Protocol, Gauntlet presents two options for Collateral Factors to the community. Option 1 is a highly conservative approach to testing the new Base mechanics. The conservatism stems from market risk, Gauntlet's primary focus, smart contracts, and other technical risks. Initially, the collateral factor will be set to 0 for these liquidity pools, with further recommendations to follow once user positions flow into the pools. On the other hand, Option 2 is less conservative and assumes that the community is more risk tolerant, and does not require extensive testing of BASE mechanics on a new chain.\n\n### Collateral Factor Options\n\n**Option 1 (Risk Averse)**\n| Asset | USDC | WETH | WBTC | cbETH | wstETH |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Collateral Factor | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% | 0% |\n\n**Option 2 (Risk Tolerant)**\n\n| Asset | USDC | WETH | WBTC | cbETH | wstETH |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Collateral Factor | 80% | 75% | 70% | 73% | 73% |\n\n**Gauntlet plans to empower the community to choose between the 2 options by submitting a snapshot for community members to decide what collateral factors to list with these liquidity pools during the initialization of the Base protocol.**\n\n### General Recommendations\n\n**Regardless of the options chosen by the community, these parameter recommendations will remain applicable for all options.**\n\n**Risk Parameters**\n\n| Asset | USDC | WETH | WBTC | cbETH | wstETH |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Liquidation Incentive | 1.1 | 1.1 | 1.1 | 1.1 | 1.1 |\n| Supply Cap | 40,000,000 ($40M)  | 10,500 ($20M) | 330 ($10M) | 5,000 ($10M) | 3,700 ($8M) |\n| Borrow Cap | 32,000,000 ($32M)  | 6300 ($12M) | 132 ($4M) | 1500 ($3M) | 1110 ($2.3M) |\n\n**IR Recommendations**\n\n| IR Parameters | USDC | WETH | WBTC | cbETH | wsETH |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Base | 0 | 0.02 | 0.02 | 0.01 | 0.01 |\n| Kink | 0.8 | .6 | .6 | .45 | .45 |\n| Multiplier | 0.05 | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.2 | 0.2 |\n| Jump Multiplier | 2.5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 3 |\n| Reserve Factor | 0.15 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.25 |\n\n\n# Supply & Borrow Cap Guardians Recommendation\n\n### Enable Gauntlet as Supply & Borrow Cap Guardian\n\nTo enhance risk management and promote efficient growth within the BASE protocol, Gauntlet proposes to serve as Supply and Borrow Cap Guardians, enabling the moonwell community to delegate the authority to adjust caps to our Gauntlet. Within the Moonwell technical [docs](https://docs.moonwell.fi/moonwell-finance/protocol-info/technical-docs/the-comptroller/guardian-roles#borrow-cap-guardian), it is stated that this Cap Guardian function “is useful if you wanted to delegate the adjustment of the borrow caps across markets to someone who specializes in these sorts of adjustments without giving them administrative access across the rest of the protocol.” As a community participant specializing in these adjustments, Gauntlet recommends being added as Guardian. We seek this guardianship for the following reasons:\n\n- **Proactive Cap Adjustments**: With this responsibility, we can promptly modify caps in response to market risk events, on-chain DEX liquidity fluctuations, and changes in liquidity pool usage.\n- **Streamlined Process:** Will simplify voting overhead and operations.\n- **Expedited Recommendations**: Gauntlet can recommend borrow and supply cap adjustments without being subject to the standard 3-day voting period and timelock, thereby increasing the speed of implementing cap changes.\n\nIf entrusted with Guardian, Gauntlet commits to adhere to the following limitations when making supply and borrow cap adjustments: \n\n- For each asset, only 1 **increase** is allowed every 5 days.\n- The supply cap can never be **increased** above 100% of the current one.\n- The borrow cap can never be **increased** above 100% of the current one.\n\nFurthermore, Gauntlet will ensure transparency and community engagement by notifying the community of cap changes and providing reasoning through forums.",

      "content": "# Simple Summary\n\n\nA proposal to adjust 4 risk parameters across 2 assets:\n\n\n| Parameter                 | Current Value | Recommended Value |\n| ------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |\n| xcUSDT Collateral Factor  | 55%           | 60%               |\n| xcUSDT Borrow Cap         | 1,300,000     | 1,400,000         |\n| USDC.wh Collateral Factor | 64%           | 66%               |\n| USDC.wh Borrow Cap        | 3,000,000     | 3,300,000         |\n----\n\n## Rationale:\n\nVaR is $1.4k and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. Our recommendations will increase LaR from $777k to $786k. xcUSDT and USDC.wh are relatively safe from a market risk perspective, so we increased their collateral factor to improve capital efficiency. WETH.wh, WGLMR, WBTC.wh, FRAX, and xcDOT's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\nBased on our risk model, the present collateral usage of xcUSDT and USDC.wh allows for an increase in CF without increasing estimated insolvencies. \n#### USDC.wh and xcUSDT Collateral Usage\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ77mgYYn.png)\n\nFor USDC.wh and xcUSDT, we recommend increasing borrow caps based on stable DEX on-chain liquidity, increased demand on the protocol, and users' recursive positions within these assets.\n\n\nAs we make recommendations through our risk models, we keep a constant check on the market liquidity and concentration risk to the Artemis protocol. In this regard, we would like to present some key liquidity figures for Artemis assets to share with the community. Since our last post, liquidity has increased for non-stablecoins.\n\n| Asset   | Concentration Risk | Total Circulating Supply | 25% Depth | 25% Depth USD | 25% Depth on June 8th |\n| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | ------------- | --------------------- |\n| ETH.wh  | 92%                | 1,822                    | 75        | $140,750      | 55                    |\n| USDC.wh | 21%                | 3,783,086                | 1,100,000 | $1,100,000    | 1,250,000             |\n| WBTC.wh | 96%                | 183                      | 5         | $150,987      | 4                     |\n| xcUSDT  | 20%                | 1,607,704                | 1,100,000 | $1,100,000    | 1,500,000             |\n| xcDOT   | 27%                | 1,285,417                | 27,000    | $137,160      | 18,000                |\n| FRAX    | 22%                | 5,319,872                | 1,100,000 | $1,100,000    | 1,500,000             |\n \n<small>*Concentration Risk represents the percentage of token supply held by Artemis.</small>\n\n#### Moonbeam 2% Market Depth for non-Stables\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HksPQeKFh.png)\n\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. To learn more about our methodologies, please see the Helpful Links section at the bottom. \n\n## Supporting Data\n\nThe below figures show trends on key market statistics regarding borrows and utilization that we will continue to monitor:\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Aggregate Positions & Borrow Usages\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyMeFUEK2.png)\n\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Supply\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyrzYI4Y2.png)\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Borrows\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJiIKLVt2.png)\n\n\n### Utilization Rate of Assets - Timeseries\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyUFF8EF3.png)\n\n\n*[Link](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/moonwell/markets/artemis?fullscreen=utilization_rate_timeseries) to chart*\n\n\n\n### Borrow Cap Utilization\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkRjmeKY3.png)\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\nThe community should use [Gauntlet’s Artemis Risk Dashboard](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/moonwell/markets/artemis/recommendations) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Artemis. \n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1mbUW5Kh.png)\n\n\n\n## Quick Links\n\n*Please click below to learn about our methodologies:*\n\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

2023 01:58:52 GMT\n- **Network**: Moonriver\n- **Block Height**: 4,645,661\n\nThe submitter (`Curly`), as part of this proposal, will get `100,000 MFAM` sent to their wallet at `0x9f94ff95cbc403cbfc18802edeaef71da8155f36`.\n# Safety Module\nAt the time this proposal was generated there was `203,798,454` **MFAM** staked in the **Safety Module**, with a valuation of `$180,067.96` (based on a **MFAM** price of `$0.000884` pulled from **SolarBeam**).\n\nThis proposal, if executed, would adjust the rewards on the **Safety Module** to <span style=\"color:red\">decrease</span> emissions <span style=\"color:red\">-100.00%</span> and emits `0` **MFAM** over the next **28 days**:\n\n- Current (estimated APR = `~32.90%`): \n    - `2.1247`

MFAM / **day**\n    - `0` MFAM / **reward cycle (28 days)**\n\n# DEX Liquidity Pool Rewarder\nAt the time this proposal was generated there were `100,219,939` **MFAM** and `17,124` **MOVR** provided by liquidity providers in the **SolarBeam** **MFAM**/**MOVR** pool totaling `$177,100.46`.\n\nThis proposal, if executed, would adjust the rewards on the **Dex Rewarder** to <span style=\"color:red\">decrease</span> emissions <span style=\"color:red\">-100.00%</span> and emits `0` **MFAM** over the next **28 days**:\n\nCurrent rewards will expire at **Fri, 14 Jul 2023 03:30:00 GMT**\n\nProposed rewards will expire at **Fri, 11 Aug 2023 03:30:00 GMT**\n\n- Current (estimated APR = `~37.51%`) days: \n    - `2.3823` MFAM / **second**\n    - `205,826.57` MFAM / **day**\n    - `5,763,144.00` MFAM / **reward cycle (28 days)**\n<br><br>\n- Proposed (estimated APR = `~0%`): \n    - `0` MFAM / **second**\n    - `0` MFAM / **day**\n    - `0` MFAM / **reward cycle (28

      "content": "## Simple Summary\nFollowing the recent Multichain [incident](https://twitter.com/TheBlock__/status/1677374484863410206?s=20), Gauntlet recommends the following risk parameters to the protocol:\n\n\n| Risk Parameter Recs | USDC.multi | ETH.multi | USDT.multi | BTC.multi |\n| ------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | --------- |\n| Reserve Factor      | 15% → 99%  | 25% → 99% | 15% → 99%  | 25% → 99% |\n| Collateral Factor   | 68% → 0%   | 62% → 0%  | 46% → 0%   | 0%        |\n\n\n- Unpause Borrowing for xcKSM, FRAX, WMOVR\n- Unpause Transfers Globally\n\n\n---\n### Specifcations\n\nGauntlet recommends these actions no matter what option the community decides to move forward with. \n\n- ************************************************Continue to freeze borrowing and supply of Multichain assets.************************************************ This will prevent additional supply and borrow of compromised Multichain assets.\n- **Increase RF**: To incentivize users to withdrawal their multi-chain supply and close debt positions, we recommend increasing the reserve factor to (RF) 99%.\n\n| Risk Parameter Recs | USDC.multi | ETH.multi | USDT.multi | BTC.multi |\n| ------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | --------- |\n| Reserve Factor      | 15% → 99%  | 25% → 99% | 15% → 99%  | 25% → 99% |\n| Collateral Factor   | 68% → 0%   | 62% → 0%  | 46% → 0%   | 0%        |\n\n- **Decrease Rewards**: Decrease borrow and supply rewards for MultiChain assets to 0.\n- **Unpause Transfers :** Combined with setting the CF to 0, this may reduce Apollo’s exposure to Multichain assets.\n\n\n- **Set CF to 0**: We recommend to set the collateral factor (CF) to 0 for all Multichain assets. This means that users will no longer be able to borrow against these assets and would be actionable for a forced liquidation.\n- **Reenable borrowing for non-multichain assets.** This returns normal functionality to non-multichain assets.\n    \n    **Liquidation Impact as of July 7th**\n    \n| Number of Users | Borrow Balance USD | Supply Balance USD | Liquidatable Amount | Multichain Supply USD | Multichain Borrow USD |\n| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |\n| 125             | $743,306           | $1,311,901         | $691,394            | $1,218,326            | $657,377              |\n\n\n#### Total (both Multichain and non Multichain) supply balances (in market rate USD) against the loan to value of the account. \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ4rE5dtn.png)\n\n <sup>* High proportion of account balances on Apollo have LTV below 80%</sup>\n\n---\n\n\n### Supporting Data\n\nThe impact from the Multichain hack can be seen with Solarbeam’s swap data. As shown within the liquidity chart of MOVR/USDC, there was an initial spike in liquidity but eventually started towards a downward trend.\n\n#### MOVR/USDC Liquidity\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJQL49dKh.png)\n\n\n\nPricing for USDC dropped precipitously initially during the depeg but has rebounded to .125. This is still 30% below market rate for USDC native to MOVR.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SypU49_Y2.png)\n\n\n\n---\n**********Notes**********\n- It's important to note that the above steps provide a general framework for the deprecation plan. Depending on the specific circumstances and requirements of Multichain Assets, additional steps or modifications may be necessary.\n- In the event that the oracle associated with MultiChain assets is not reflecting accurate market price, it means that liquidations will not occur for market rate insolvent accounts. This is because the liquidated collateral would be worth less than the amount repaid. However, liquidations will still occur for market rate solvent accounts.\n\n",

- Smart contract that allows users to stake their MFAM tokens in order to earn liquidity incentives and help backstop the Moonwell protocol.\n\n**Reward Speed**  - The rate at which MFAM tokens (on a per second basis) are distributed proportionally to DEX LPs, wallets staking in the Safety Module, and those supplying/borrowing on Moonwell.\n\n---\nConfig Hash:

Our recommendations will increase LaR from $483k to $484k. xcUSDT is relatively safe from a market risk perspective, so we can gradually increased its collateral factor to improve capital efficiency. WETH.wh, WGLMR, WBTC.wh, USDC.wh, FRAX, and xcDOT's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\nAnalyzing xcUSDT positions, the top suppliers of xcUSDT have recursive stable positions. This data is supportive of our model's recommendation to increase xcUSDT collateral factor.\n#### Top 10 xcUSDT Supplier's borrow positions\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkyI7nJP3.png)\n\n\nFor USDC.wh and xcUSDT, we recommend increasing borrow caps based on stable DEX on-chain liquidity and increased demand on the protocol.\n\nAs we make recommendations through our risk models, we keep a constant check on the market liquidity and concentration risk to the Artemis protocol. In this regard, we would like to present some key liquidity figures for Artemis assets to share with the community. Since our last post, liquidity has decreased for non-stablecoins. We will continue to monitor these assets and provide further recommendation when necessary.\n\n| Asset   | Concentration Risk | Total Circulating Supply | 25% Depth | 25% Depth USD | 25% Depth on May 11th |\n| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | ------------- | --------------------- |\n| ETH.wh  | 94%                | 1,992                    | 55        | $98,727       | 80                    |\n| USDC.wh | 43%                | 4,905,502                | 1,250,000 | $1,250,000    | 1,500,000             |\n| WBTC.wh | 96%                | 143                      | 4         | $108,246      | 6                     |\n| xcUSDT  | 20%                | 1,864,992                | 1,500,000 | $1,500,000    | 1,300,000             |\n| xcDOT   | 33%                | 971,246                  | 18,000    | $95,400       | 26,000                |\n| FRAX    | 24%                | 5,319,872                | 1,500,000 | $1,500,000    | 1,300,000             |\n\n<small>*Concentration Risk represents the percentage of token supply held by Artemis.</small>\n\n\nEven though none of the assets on Artemis were exposed to the Multichain bridge, we still found some impact during the Multichain FUD when investigating liquidity for Artemis assets on Moonbeam chain. Artemis assets' liquidity decreased during the initial market news about Multichain. Some assets such as xcDOT, WETH.wh, and WGLMR experienced initial dips of 20-40% before rebounding.\n#### Moonbeam 2% Market Depth\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1fMxh1Dn.png)\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. To learn more about our methodologies, please see the Helpful Links section at the bottom.\n\n## Supporting Data\n\nThe below figures show trends on key market statistics regarding borrows and utilization that we will continue to monitor:\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Aggregate Positions & Borrow Usages\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1JJXuyw3.png)\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Supply\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJkW7dJPh.png)\n*[Link](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/moonwell/markets/artemis?fullscreen=supply_composition_top_10_borrowers) to chart*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Borrows\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJjzXOyP3.png)\n*[Link](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/moonwell/markets/artemis?fullscreen=borrow_composition_top_10_borrowers) to chart*\n\n\n\n\n### Utilization Rate of Assets - Timeseries\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyQ9rcJPn.png)\n\n*[Link](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/moonwell/markets/artemis?fullscreen=utilization_rate_timeseries) to chart*\n\n\n\n### Borrow Cap Utilization\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJX7Zdkvn.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\nThe community should use [Gauntlet’s Artemis Risk Dashboard](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/moonwell/markets/artemis/recommendations) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Artemis.\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJguB51w2.png)\n\n---\n# IR Rec Supporting Data\n\n## Abstract\nGiven the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet’s platform has evaluated all assets on Apollo and Artemis' active markets and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol. Our methodology makes data-informed decisions around setting borrower and supplier interest rates when market conditions require the protocol to reduce risk or when strategic opportunities present themselves to increase protocol revenue without materially impacting risk.\n\n## Methodology\n\n## Objectives\nAmong other factors, there are two primary reasons to adjust an interest rate curve:\n\n1. **mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool**\n2. **build reserves via protocol revenue to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future**\n\nAs a secondary objective, we want to **optimize the user experience of Moonwell's borrowers and suppliers**.\n\n### Mitigating Risk\nThe first case of mitigating 100% utilization is of more immediate benefit to the protocol. High utilization is poor UX for suppliers, as it can restrict their ability to withdraw an asset from the pool. For example, if a pool contains $10M in xcUSDT, and $9M are loaned out, the maximum a supplier could withdraw is $1M since the pool cannot exceed 100% utilization. In addition to impacting suppliers, liquidations may be hindered because, at 100% utilization, only mTokens (not the underlying collateral) can be seized. If liquidators are concerned they won’t be able to cash these mTokens in for the underlying collateral in time to lock in a profit, this risks leaving the protocol with insolvent debt. Increasing interest rates can motivate borrowers to repay the asset and motivate suppliers to deposit more of the asset. Both would decrease utilization to more desirable levels.\n\n### Building Reserves\nThe second use case of building reserves is more opportunistic in nature. Reserves serve as the rainy day fund for protocols, protecting against unforseen events. Over time they may also be used to fund operations, reducing the reliance on the native token treasury. Moreover, interest rates can be used opportunistically to capture increased reserves when specific market conditions are met. Since the annualized reserve growth is (total borrowed) * (borrow rate) * (reserve factor), opportunities to increase revenue present themselves when:\n1. We can incentivize more borrowing without slashing borrow rates\n2. We can increase borrow rates without losing borrowers\n3. We can raise reserve factors without losing suppliers\n\n## Elasticity Model\nThe reaction of borrowers and suppliers to changes in interest rate is governed by borrower and supplier elasticity. If a borrower is elastic, they would reduce their borrowing position in response to an increased interest rate, but if a borrower is inelastic, they would ignore changes in interest rates. If a supplier is elastic, they would increase their supplying position in response to increased interest rates, but if a supplier is inelastic, they would ignore changes to interest rates.\n\nInterest rates on Artemis and Apollo are computed as a function of utilization through the interest rate curve such that interest rates are higher when utilization is higher. As a result, there is a natural counterbalancing effect to interest rate curve changes: if borrowers or suppliers are elastic, then an increase in interest rates would be followed by borrowers reducing their positions or suppliers increasing their positions, which would bring interest rates back down.\n\nConsider the case where either all borrowers are elastic and all suppliers are inelastic. The figure below shows the expected user behavior if we were to swap out Curve A for Curve B. At time t=1 (shown as ① in the figure), the borrow rate is steady at the market rate. At time t=2, we execute the IR curve change to Curve B which hikes the borrower rate. As a result, borrowers begin closing their positions due to the higher rate because they are elastic, until we get back down to the equilibrium rate at t=3.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m0cKTeX.png)\n\nAn analagous scenario can be constructed if suppliers are elastic and borrowers are inelastic. If both borrowers and suppliers are elastic, it is harder to predict the effect on user positions because it is dependent on who is more elastic and who acts faster between borrowers and suppliers.\n\nWhile this simple model is helpful in making recs, it is important to caveat that different tokens can have a mixture of elastic and inelastic users, and that no user is perfectly elastic or inelastic. It is also important to note that utilization is extremely noisy, fluctuating due to token prices, competing yield offerings, and the whims of individual users, which makes elasticity measurement noisy.\n\n## Impact Measurement\nWhen making IR curve recs, we measure impact in 3 ways:\n1. Predicted immediate impact on utilization and revenue\n3. Counterfactual utilization\n2. Rate at 100% utilization\n\n### Predicted immediate impact on utilization and revenue\nBased on our assumptions about borrower and supplier elasticity, we can quantify the expected change in total amounts borrowed and supplied:\n- If only borrowers are elastic, then we can compute the change in amount borrowed by assuming that the borrow rate will be restored to equilibrium\n- If only suppliers are elastic, then we can compute the change in amount supplied by assuming that the supply rate will be restored to equilibrium\n- If borrowers and suppliers are inelastic, then we can assume that borrows and supply stay constant\n\nBased on the new equilibrium borrows and supply, we can compute the **projected utilization** and **projected protocol revenue**.\n\n### Counterfactual utilization\nBased on our assumptions about borrower and supplier elasticity, we can look at historical interest rate data to predict what utilization would have been if we were on a different IR curve. If borrowers are elastic, we can take the borrow rate at a given point in time and determine what utilization it corresponds to on a new interest rate curve. If suppliers are elastic, we could do the same with supplier interest rates.\n\nIn order to quantify the risk posed by a historical or counterfactual timeseries of utilization, we measure the **percentage of time that utilization was above 90%, 95%, and 99%**.\n\nWhen computing counterfactual utilization, there are a few caveats that are important to keep in mind:\n* During utilization spikes, users could be quite inelastic to interest rates which may cause impact to be overestimated\n* For moments when utilization hit 100%, we cannot measure counterfactual utilization because we do not know the maximum interest rates that users would have tolerated\n\n### Rate at 100% utilization\nThe maximum borrower and supplier interest rates are used when utilization is 100%. If this rate is not high enough, there would not be enough incentive for borrowers to close their positions and suppliers to enter, leaving the protocol at risk. But if this rate is too high, we may see borrowers getting quickly liquidated from the exorbiant interest fees, which would be bad for user experience but also potentially lead to liquidation cascades.\n\nWe use the **liquidation time** metric to better quantify this danger of max interest rates getting too high. We define it as the time it would take for a user to get liquidated if they supply USDC and borrow 80% of its value in a given token at the max token borrow rate and the min USDC supply rate. We assume that interest compounds once per block for this calculation.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n## WETH.wh, USDC.wh, and xcUSDT Risk-Off Recs\nWETH.wh, xcUSDT, USDC.wh have continue to utilize a high percentage of their respective Borrow cap since early April. Continous borrow cap usage signals that borrowers are likely inelastic to increases in interest rates because they would likely borrow more if the option were available.\n\n### Utilization and Cap Usage\n#### WETH.wh\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By-ASuCI3.png)\n\n#### USDC.wh\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1nk8O08h.png)\n\n#### xcUSDT\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJmZLd0I3.png)\n\n\nGiven the signal for inelasticity of users to increases to borrow rates, we recommend an increase of the Multiplier for all 3 assets. This Multiplier increase will earn more revenue for the protocol\n\n### IR Curve Changes\n#### WETH.wh\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1LvXuAIh.png)\n#### USDC.wh\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk2d7uRL3.png)\n#### xcUSDT\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy0tQuR8h.png)\n\n\n### Current and Recommended IR Params\n#### WETH.wh\n| parameter       | Current Artemis | Recommended |\n| --------------- | --------------- | ----------- |\n| Base            | 0.02            | 0.02        |\n| Kink            | 0.6             | 0.6         |\n| Multiplier      | 0.15            | 0.1875      |\n| Jump Multiplier | 3               | 3           |\n| Reserve Factor  | 0.25            | 0.25        |\n\n#### USDC.wh\n\n| parameter       | Current | Recommended |\n| --------------- | --------------- | ----------- |\n| Base            | 0               | 0           |\n| Kink            | 0.8             | 0.8         |\n| Multiplier      | 0.05            | 0.0625      |\n| Jump Multiplier | 2.5             | 2.5         |\n| Reserve Factor  | 0.15            | 0.15        |\n\n#### xcUSDT - Current and Recommended IR Params\n| parameter       | Current | Recommended |\n| --------------- | --------------- | ----------- |\n| Base            | 0               | 0           |\n| Kink            | 0.8             | 0.8         |\n| Multiplier      | 0.05            | 0.0625      |\n| Jump Multiplier | 2.5             | 2.5         |\n| Reserve Factor  | 0.15            | 0.15        |\n\n\n### Estimated Impact of IR Recs\n| Assets  | Current Annualized Rev | Projected Annualized Rev | Delta  | Percent Change |\n| ------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------ | -------------- |\n| WETH.wh | $42,519     | $50,920       | $8,400 | 19.76%         |\n| USDC.wh | $9,799      | $12,289       | $2,490 | 25.42%         |\n| xcUSDT  | $5,754      | $7,227        | $1,473 | 25.60%         |\n\n\n## Quick Links\n\n*Please click below to learn about our methodologies:*\n\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

The LaR is $58k and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. USDC.multi, USDT.multi, WMOVR, FRAX, and xcKSM's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\nETH.multi can be de-risked with relatively small impact in capital efficiency, so we recommend decreasing its collateral factor to reduce overall risk. ETH.multi’s 25% market depth on Solarbeam is at $37k while collateral usage is at $210k. As of now, we recommend reducing the collateral factor by 200 bps in order to prevent any liquidations which might impact user experience.\n\nVisualizing Gauntlet's internal on-chain liquidity data, the 30% reduction on ETH.multi's 2% market depth post Multichain market stress is evident. We continue to still monitor these liquidity levels and will provide further risk recommendations if necessary.\n#### ETH.multi 2% Market Depth\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJXovjyD2.png)\n\n### MultiChain Borrow Cap Reductions\n\nGauntlet analyzes assets’ on-chain liquidity and potential risk of short market manipulation attack to assess borrow cap recommendations. With ETH.multi, USDC.multi, and USDT.multi's low borrow cap usage and lower liquidity and circulating supply on Moonriver post the MultiChain market FUD, we recommend lowering their caps to reduce market and exploitation risk to the protocol.\n\nMultichain assets have exited from the Apollo protocol and Moonriver chain during the Multichain market stress. As shown in the chart below, MultiChain assets have experienced a large decrease in circulating supply of tokens on the Moonriver chain from May 22nd until now. ETH.multi and USDC.multi experienced the largest outflow of tokens with 70% and 54% reduction, respectively.\n#### Circulating Supply Decrease for Multi Assets\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyeRv4o1Pn.png)\n\nBorrow Amounts for the MultiChain Assets experience a large decrease during the market stress period. As such, our recommendation to reduce borrow caps protects the protocol from liquidity concerns and potential market exploitation.\n\n#### Borrow By Asset - Timeseries\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJh4UjJD3.png)\n\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. To learn more about our methodologies, please see the Helpful Links section at the bottom.\n\n## Supporting Data\n\nThe below figures show trends on key market statistics regarding borrows and utilization that we will continue to monitor:\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Aggregate Positions & Borrow Usages\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkUJGvJvh.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Supply\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkczbPyw2.png)\n*[Link](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/moonwell/markets/apollo?fullscreen=supply_composition_top_10_borrowers) to chart*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Borrows\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJeJbDJvh.png)\n*[Link](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/moonwell/markets/apollo?fullscreen=borrow_composition_top_10_borrowers) to chart*\n\n\n\n\n### Utilization Rate of Assets - Timeseries\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1vigwyP3.png)\n*[Link](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/moonwell/markets/apollo?fullscreen=utilization_rate_timeseries) to chart*\n\n\n\n### Borrow Cap Utilization\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bkf7JDkP2.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\nThe community should use Gauntlet's [Apollo Risk Dashboard](https://risk.gauntlet.network/protocols/moonwell/markets/apollo) to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk.\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1SLHq1v2.png)\n\n---\n# IR Rec Supporting Data\n\n## Abstract\nGiven the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet’s platform has evaluated all assets on Apollo and Artemis' active markets and has identified opportunities to adjust parameters for certain assets for the benefit of the protocol. Our methodology makes data-informed decisions around setting borrower and supplier interest rates when market conditions require the protocol to reduce risk or when strategic opportunities present themselves to increase protocol revenue without materially impacting risk.\n\n## Methodology\n\n## Objectives\nAmong other factors, there are two primary reasons to adjust an interest rate curve:\n\n1. **mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool**\n2. **build reserves via protocol revenue to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future**\n\nAs a secondary objective, we want to **optimize the user experience of Moonwell's borrowers and suppliers**.\n\n### Mitigating Risk\nThe first case of mitigating 100% utilization is of more immediate benefit to the protocol. High utilization is poor UX for suppliers, as it can restrict their ability to withdraw an asset from the pool. For example, if a pool contains $10M in xcUSDT, and $9M are loaned out, the maximum a supplier could withdraw is $1M since the pool cannot exceed 100% utilization. In addition to impacting suppliers, liquidations may be hindered because, at 100% utilization, only mTokens (not the underlying collateral) can be seized. If liquidators are concerned they won’t be able to cash these mTokens in for the underlying collateral in time to lock in a profit, this risks leaving the protocol with insolvent debt. Increasing interest rates can motivate borrowers to repay the asset and motivate suppliers to deposit more of the asset. Both would decrease utilization to more desirable levels.\n\n### Building Reserves\nThe second use case of building reserves is more opportunistic in nature. Reserves serve as the rainy day fund for protocols, protecting against unforseen events. Over time they may also be used to fund operations, reducing the reliance on the native token treasury. Moreover, interest rates can be used opportunistically to capture increased reserves when specific market conditions are met. Since the annualized reserve growth is (total borrowed) * (borrow rate) * (reserve factor), opportunities to increase revenue present themselves when:\n1. We can incentivize more borrowing without slashing borrow rates\n2. We can increase borrow rates without losing borrowers\n3. We can raise reserve factors without losing suppliers\n\n## Elasticity Model\nThe reaction of borrowers and suppliers to changes in interest rate is governed by borrower and supplier elasticity. If a borrower is elastic, they would reduce their borrowing position in response to an increased interest rate, but if a borrower is inelastic, they would ignore changes in interest rates. If a supplier is elastic, they would increase their supplying position in response to increased interest rates, but if a supplier is inelastic, they would ignore changes to interest rates.\n\nInterest rates on Artemis and Apollo are computed as a function of utilization through the interest rate curve such that interest rates are higher when utilization is higher. As a result, there is a natural counterbalancing effect to interest rate curve changes: if borrowers or suppliers are elastic, then an increase in interest rates would be followed by borrowers reducing their positions or suppliers increasing their positions, which would bring interest rates back down.\n\nConsider the case where either all borrowers are elastic and all suppliers are inelastic. The figure below shows the expected user behavior if we were to swap out Curve A for Curve B. At time t=1 (shown as ① in the figure), the borrow rate is steady at the market rate. At time t=2, we execute the IR curve change to Curve B which hikes the borrower rate. As a result, borrowers begin closing their positions due to the higher rate because they are elastic, until we get back down to the equilibrium rate at t=3.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/m0cKTeX.png)\n\nAn analagous scenario can be constructed if suppliers are elastic and borrowers are inelastic. If both borrowers and suppliers are elastic, it is harder to predict the effect on user positions because it is dependent on who is more elastic and who acts faster between borrowers and suppliers.\n\nWhile this simple model is helpful in making recs, it is important to caveat that different tokens can have a mixture of elastic and inelastic users, and that no user is perfectly elastic or inelastic. It is also important to note that utilization is extremely noisy, fluctuating due to token prices, competing yield offerings, and the whims of individual users, which makes elasticity measurement noisy.\n\n## Impact Measurement\nWhen making IR curve recs, we measure impact in 3 ways:\n1. Predicted immediate impact on utilization and revenue\n3. Counterfactual utilization\n2. Rate at 100% utilization\n\n### Predicted immediate impact on utilization and revenue\nBased on our assumptions about borrower and supplier elasticity, we can quantify the expected change in total amounts borrowed and supplied:\n- If only borrowers are elastic, then we can compute the change in amount borrowed by assuming that the borrow rate will be restored to equilibrium\n- If only suppliers are elastic, then we can compute the change in amount supplied by assuming that the supply rate will be restored to equilibrium\n- If borrowers and suppliers are inelastic, then we can assume that borrows and supply stay constant\n\nBased on the new equilibrium borrows and supply, we can compute the **projected utilization** and **projected protocol revenue**.\n\n### Counterfactual utilization\nBased on our assumptions about borrower and supplier elasticity, we can look at historical interest rate data to predict what utilization would have been if we were on a different IR curve. If borrowers are elastic, we can take the borrow rate at a given point in time and determine what utilization it corresponds to on a new interest rate curve. If suppliers are elastic, we could do the same with supplier interest rates.\n\nIn order to quantify the risk posed by a historical or counterfactual timeseries of utilization, we measure the **percentage of time that utilization was above 90%, 95%, and 99%**.\n\nWhen computing counterfactual utilization, there are a few caveats that are important to keep in mind:\n* During utilization spikes, users could be quite inelastic to interest rates which may cause impact to be overestimated\n* For moments when utilization hit 100%, we cannot measure counterfactual utilization because we do not know the maximum interest rates that users would have tolerated\n\n### Rate at 100% utilization\nThe maximum borrower and supplier interest rates are used when utilization is 100%. If this rate is not high enough, there would not be enough incentive for borrowers to close their positions and suppliers to enter, leaving the protocol at risk. But if this rate is too high, we may see borrowers getting quickly liquidated from the exorbiant interest fees, which would be bad for user experience but also potentially lead to liquidation cascades.\n\nWe use the **liquidation time** metric to better quantify this danger of max interest rates getting too high. We define it as the time it would take for a user to get liquidated if they supply USDC and borrow 80% of its value in a given token at the max token borrow rate and the min USDC supply rate. We assume that interest compounds once per block for this calculation.\n\n\n---\n# IR Recommendations\n\n### USDC.multi and USDT.multi Risk-Off Recs\nMarket reaction to Multichain assets the past of couple of weeks have caused some significant outflow in liquidity from the Apollo market. As such, USDC.multi and USDT.multi utilization have experienced recent spikes close to 100% utilization and had continous high utilization greater than 8 hours. Gauntlet is recommending higher Jump Multiplier to prevent high utilization.\n\n### Utilization and Cap Usage\n#### USDC.multi\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJm8THRU2.png)\n#### USDT.multi\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkXcTHAU3.png)\n\n### IR Curve Changes\n#### USDC.multi\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJEPTS0Uh.png)\n#### USDT.multi\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk2i6SRL2.png)\n\n\n#### USDC.multi - Current and Recommended IR Params\n| parameter       | Current | Recommended |\n| --------------- | -------------- | ----------- |\n| Base            | 0              | 0           |\n| Kink            | 0.8            | 0.8         |\n| Multiplier      | 0.05           | 0.05        |\n| Jump Multiplier | 2.5            | 3.175       |\n| Reserve Factor  | 0.15           | 0.15        |\n\n\n#### USDT.multi - Current and Recommended IR Params\n| parameter       | Current | Recommended |\n| --------------- | -------------- | ----------- |\n| Base            | 0              | 0           |\n| Kink            | 0.8            | 0.8         |\n| Multiplier      | 0.05           | 0.05        |\n| Jump Multiplier | 2.5            | 3.175       |\n| Reserve Factor  | 0.15           | 0.15        |\n\n### Estimated Impact of IR Recs\n#### Max Borrow Rate\n\n| Asset      | Current | New Max Rate | Delta  | Percent Change |\n| ---------- | ------- | --------- | ------ | -------------- |\n| USDT.multi | 71.53%  | 96.28%    | 24.75% | 34.60%         |\n| USDC.multi | 71.53%  | 96.28%    | 24.75% | 34.60%         |\n\n#### Liquidation Timing\n\n| Asset      | Current   | Projected | Delta   | Percent Change |\n| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ------- | -------------- |\n| USDT.multi | \\-82 days | \\-61 days | 21 days | \\-25.70%       |\n| USDC.multi | \\-82 days | \\-61 days | 21 days | \\-25.70%       |\n\n<small> *Liquidation Timing represents the time it would take someone to get liquidated if they supply USDC.multi and borrow the max amount of <token> that they can, when the USDC supply rate is at its min and <token>’s borrow rate is at its max.</small>\n\n#### Counterfactual Utilization TimeSeries\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJYAgaCUh.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkMMZp08n.png)\n\n\n\n## Quick Links\n\n*Please click below to learn about our methodologies:*\n\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

      "title": "MGP-4 Moonwell-ITB Risk Management Tools Phase II",
      "content": "Authors: IntoTheBlock Research\n\nJune 5, 2023\n\n### Summary\n\nFollowing a successful launch of [Phase I](https://defirisk.intotheblock.com/metrics/moonbeam/moonwell) and approval on the [Snapshot vote](https://snapshot.org/#/moonwell-governance.eth/proposal/0x3961a3dd763e11e82bb77a410f3bff3cab2f59589881f90201a7e60d9169e467), IntoTheBlock is moving ahead with the on-chain vote for Phase II of its risk management tools for Moonwell.\n\nTo further expand risk management capabilities for Moonwell, ITB seeks to apply for Phase II of the grant, targeting the following deliverables:\n- 10 new indicators to add to the risk dashboard\n- API access and CSV download for all metrics\n- Documentation of Moonwell’s risk indicators and general dynamics\n- Add Base (Coinbase L2) support for risk metrics\nOverview\n\nOver the past two years IntoTheBlock has been heavily involved in DeFi. This started with the launch of DeFi Insights analytics and has grown significantly through our Institutional Quantitative Strategies (ITB Quant) service. ITB’s DeFi Quant platform acts as a gateway used by 20+ of the largest crypto institutions to access its DeFi yields via sophisticated quantitative strategies with appropriate risk management models. Moonwell’s strategy is one of the latest additions to the ITB DeFi Quant platform, with ITB clients depositing several millions into the protocol.\n\nTo streamline institutional adoption of DeFi, IntoTheBlock decided to make risk metrics and models accessible via APIs and analytics dashboards. The purpose of this proposal is to make these risk models available to Moonwell’s institutional and individual investors.\n\n### Motivation\n\nMonitoring and managing risk is paramount to any financial service. Recent events in the DeFi market prove that risk management is essential to accelerating the growth of the space. At ITB we believe that risk management in DeFi should be done out in the open, following crypto’s ethos, and not be a luxury expense.\n\nFollowing ITB’s experience safeguarding hundreds of millions into DeFi through advanced risk management models, we believe that expanding these tools and offering them to Moonwell would help make DeFi safer over the mid-to long-term. Enabling Moonwell’s community to monitor real-time economic risks should be a key factor in boosting institutional and retail investor confidence.\n\n### Implementation\n\nIntoTheBlock has structured this grant within two phases. After successfully shipping all deliverables from Phase I on time, IntoTheBlock is proposing to continue forward with Phase II with the following:\n\n- 10 new indicators to add to the risk dashboard (specific metrics are covered within the following document)\n- API access and CSV download for all metrics\n- Documentation of Moonwell’s risk indicators and general dynamics\n- Add Base (Coinbase L2) support for risk metrics\n\nThese indicators are open to modification after receiving feedback from the Moonwell community and other Moonwell contributors. IntoTheBlock is dedicated to maintain and expand the capabilities of the Moonwell risk monitoring solution that address changes to the protocol or market conditions.\n\n### Grant Milestones & Payments\n\nFor Phase II, IntoTheBlock is requesting a total of $30k upon the start of the aforementioned deliverables.\n\nWe are targeting a launch 30 days after the proposal passes for Phase II.\n\nThe exchange rate of WELL/USD will be the 30-day time-weighted average price (TWAP) prior to the date the proposal is submitted. The price source is the close price of WELL published by CoinMarketCap and calculations for the corresponding amount of tokens can be found in the [following spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dc1YG8z0KR7sfnbeEuLfWc1_nCRHewM5Q7ZHXEjNggE/edit#gid=97083877).\n\nThe release of these milestones will also be accompanied with a marketing push from the IntoTheBlock team to increase the visibility of these tools.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIntoTheBlock’s proposal looks to expand the offering of real time economic risk monitoring for the Moonwell protocol. The risk indicators included in this proposal are based on IntoTheBlock’s experience managing and monitoring risks for institutional clients depositing into Moonwell and similar protocols. This release is part of a broader effort to democratize access to risk management tools for all DeFi users, including those of the Moonwell protocol.\n",

      "title": "MIP 52 Apollo Risk Parameter Recs (2023-05-22)",
      "content": "## Apollo Summary\n\nWe recommend the following parameter changes:\n- Decrease WMOVR borrow cap from 335,000 to 120,000\n- Decrease xcKSM borrow cap from 32,000 to 19,000\n- Decrease ETH.multi borrow cap from 1,500 to 700\n\n\n### CF and Borrow Cap Rationale:\n\nApollo's VaR is $0 and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. The LaR is $102k and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. USDC.multi, ETH.multi, USDT.multi, WMOVR, FRAX, and xcKSM's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\nGauntlet analyzes assets’ on-chain liquidity and potential risk of short market manipulation attack to assess borrow cap recommendations. With WMOVR, xcKSM, and ETH.multi's low borrow cap usage and low liquidity on Moonriver's DEXes, we recommend to lower their caps to reduce market and exploitation risk to the protocol.\n\n#### WMOVR, xcKSM, and ETH.multi Borrow Cap Usage\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJS8KLFr3.png)\n\nBorrow Cap usage has decreased below 20% for WMOVR, xcKSM, and ETH.multi since last recommendations.\n\nThe relative large drop in ETH.multi borrow cap usage can be attributed to the Apollo's largest borrow position account [0x6fffe084f6413fa400bdb93b951e71e190d5d18a](https://debank.com/profile/0x6fffe084f6413fa400bdb93b951e71e190d5d18a/stream) in which they closed their $2.1M ETH borrow position and increased their borrow position in USDC.multi.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HktB3pq4h.png)\n\n\n#### WMOVR, xcKSM, and ETH.multi 2% Depth Liquidity\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkoHPUtBh.png)\n*2% Depth represents the sum of the 2% liquidity depth over the unique paths between this displayed tokens and stablecoins (typically USDC, USDT).*\n\nThese assets 2% depth have decreased significantly since earlier in the year but recent liquidity conditions have been relatively low and flat.\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation.

      "content": "## Summary:\n\nThe Gauntlet team recently launched [Aera](http://aera.finance), an autonomous treasury management protocol. The initial version of Aera was built specifically for lending protocols like Moonwell. This proposal is to run a free Aera pilot for a portion of Moonwell’s Apollo reserve funds.\n\n**Specifically this governance proposal is a follow up to the [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/moonwell-apollo-governance.eth/proposal/0xa5c1d4e4f72637f3f73366146b8df51bf6a7ca5eb28514aa51c60000b6184b01) in which the community indicated alignment on a 15% volatility targeted Aera Vault. This proposal will withdraw 250k of Moonwell Apollo USDC.multi reserves from the protocol and transfers them to an Aera team owned wallet (0xf72Dbe617a4f24c8447178f6F11E4F399393255e) on Moonriver.**\n\nAll details can be found on the forums https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/proposal-pilot-aera-for-moonwell/490\n\n## Pilot Description\n\nFor our initial use case we built an Aera Vault that allows DAOs to capture gains in periods of market strength and protect losses during downturns. Specifically, we built an Aera vault comprising of ETH and USDC that allows the DAO to target a specific portfolio volatility level (i.e. 5%, 10%, 15%) as a method of managing overall portfolio risk. This Aera vault is rebalanced on a daily basis to target the specified volatility level. A volatility targeted portfolio is a common product in TradFi to better manage portfolio risk in a way that is adaptive to market conditions.\n\nSome additional details\n\n1. The initial objective of the vault will be the volatility target decided on by the DAO\n2. Gauntlet will serve as the initial Guardian with all fees set to zero. There will not be other guardians participating for this pilot.\n3. Guardians and Arbitrageurs continuously rebalance the vault based on the volatility target decided on by the DAO and market conditions.\n4. The Moonwell community can view vault performance through a public dashboard and withdraw funds at anytime.\n\n## Implementation\n\nWe want to start with a small test pilot for Moonwell in Q2 to build trust in the Aera protocol. Throughout the quarter, we will share performance updates for these funds and provide a dashboard that is open to the public. Assuming the pilot goes well, the community can vote to increase the allocation size once the pilot concludes. Currently, Aera is only launched on Ethereum Mainnet and Polygon. The Aera Vault for Moonwell Apollo, would live on Polygon and comprise of ETH and USDC that is rebalanced on a daily basis. As such in order to fund this vault we will need to move funds from Moonriver to Polygon, the steps are described below:\n\nPilot steps:\n\n1. [**Complete**] **This step has identified the 15% volatility target as the communities preference via this [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/moonwell-apollo-governance.eth/proposal/0xa5c1d4e4f72637f3f73366146b8df51bf6a7ca5eb28514aa51c60000b6184b01). The following governance proposal will only offer Yae, Nay, Abstain as options.** We keep the original text for this text for posterity: Moonwell snapshot to align on specific volatility level that the Aera Vault should target. We will create a snapshot with 3 different volatility levels that the community can align on:\n    1. Volatility target 5% (Conservative Risk Tolerance) - based on the past year, this target would have roughly rebalanced between 4-9% ETH and 91%-96% USDC. This volatility level has in the lowest exposure to ETH relative to the other volatility levels. Lower exposure means that the vault could see lower gains/losses in $ terms.\n    2. Volatility target 10% (Moderate Risk Tolerance) - based on the past year this target would have roughly rebalanced between 8-20% ETH in the vault.\n    3. Volatility target 15% (Aggressive Risk Tolerance) - based on the past year this target would have roughly rebalanced between 13-29% ETH in the vault. This target would have the most exposure to ETH. More exposure means that the vault could see more gains/losses in $ terms.\n\n2. Moonwell governance approves a recallable unsecured loan to Aera via a governance vote. Loan terms are below*, some highlights:\n    1. Loan can be recalled at any time via Moonwell governance\n    2. If the value of the vault drops below $200k for 7 or more continuous days, the Vault will be shut down and Aera will return $200k to Moonwell\n    3. **Given the successful [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/moonwell-apollo-governance.eth/proposal/0xa5c1d4e4f72637f3f73366146b8df51bf6a7ca5eb28514aa51c60000b6184b01), this governance proposal will be for a 15% volatility target Aera Vault, and will offer Yae, Nay, and Abstain options only.**\n3. In the case that the above governance vote passes, $250k from Apollo USDC.multi reserves would be deposited into an Aera vault on Polygon\n    1. Specifically, the steps would be:\n        1. **This governance proposal will remove 250k of Moonwell Apollo USDC.multi reserves from the protocol and transfers them to an Aera team owned wallet (cross-chain compatible) on Moonriver. Specifically 0xf72Dbe617a4f24c8447178f6F11E4F399393255e**\n        2. From there, the Aera team unbridges from Moonriver to an Aera team owned wallet on Ethereum, then bridges USDC from Ethereum to an Aera team owned wallet on Polygon\n        3. The funds are then deposited into an Aera vault on Polygon via a Aera team owned multisig\n4. If the Moonwell wishes to recall the loan at any time, this can be done via a snapshot vote indicating the community preference to recall. At this point the Aera team will withdraw from the vault and return the funds to the Apollo Reserves (described in loan terms*)\n\n## Why Aera\n\nThis initial version of Aera allows DAOs to put idle assets to work in an autonomous, risk-aware manner. We have been testing Aera internally at Gauntlet for over 9 months and have been operating a ETH/USDC Aera vault on Polygon with our own funds. In addition Aera has been audited by Spearbit, which can be seen in our [docs](https://docs.aera.finance/contracts/security).\n\n## FAQs:\n\n- What does this cost?\n    - Free during pilot phase\n    - Cost structure will be considered in late 2023 during scaled rollout phase\n- When will there be more Guardians?\n    - During the scaled rollout phase in late 2023. A new version will launch with the ability to assign new Guardians and enable vault fees to promote Guardian specialization and competition.\n- Are there docs?\n    - Yes! See [docs.aera.finance](https://docs.aera.finance)\n\n### Loan terms\n\n**Aera Foundation will receive a loan of USDC in an original principal amount of US $250,000 equivalent market value (the \"*Loan Tokens*\") for an initial term of six (6) months, to be renewed automatically unless an affirmative recorded snapshot vote of non-renewal is taken by the Moonwell Apollo DAO. The loan may be recalled at any time by an affirmative recorded snapshot vote of the Moonwell Apollo DAO; in which case Aera shall promptly repay the Loan Tokens, subject to standard processing and transfer protocols. If the value of the Loan Tokens should decrease by more than twenty percent (20%) for a period of more than seven  (7) continuous calendar days during the term of this loan, then Aera shall promptly repay the Loan Tokens and additional USDC in an amount adequate to return not less than $200,000 equivalent market value of USDC to the Moonwell Apollo DAO.**\n\nVoting options:\n--\n- YAE (Start an Aera pilot with a 15% volatility target)\n- NAE (Do not start an Aera pilot)\n- ABSTAIN\n",

      "title": "MIP 50 Artemis Risk Parameter Recs (2023-05-11)",
      "content": "## Artemis Summary\n\nWe recommend the following risk parameter changes:\n\n- Increase the xcUSDT collateral factor from 50.0% to 53.0%.\n- Increase the USDC.wh collateral factor from 62.0% to 64.0%.\n- Increase USDC.wh borrow cap from 2,100,000 to 2,600,000.\n- Increase FRAX borrow cap from 5,000,000 to 5,250,000.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nVaR is $0 and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. Our recommendations will increase LaR from $302k to $303k. xcUSDT and USDC.wh are relatively safe from a market risk perspective, so we can gradually increased their collateral factor to improve capital efficiency. WETH.wh, WGLMR, WBTC.wh, FRAX, and xcDOT's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\nWith no recent improvement in liquidity for ETH.wh, we do not currently recommend to increase borrow cap for this asset, even though borrow cap usage is at 97%. As for USDC.wh and FRAX, we recommend to increase borrow caps based on current market liquidity and underlying user positions.\n\nAs we make recommendations through our risk models, we keep a constant check on the market liquidity and concentration risk to the Artemis protocol. In this regard, we would like to present some key liquidity figures for Artemis assets to share with the community. Since our last post, liquidity has improved for stablecoins while non-stablecoins have experienced some gradual decline in market depth.\n\n| Asset   | Concentration Risk | Total Circulating Supply | Current 25% Depth | Current 25% Depth USD | 25% Depth on April 12th |\n| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |\n| ETH.wh  | 89%                | 1,860.78                 | 80        | $143,602      | 110                     |\n| USDC.wh | 46%                | 4,566,251.00             | 1,500,000 | $1,500,000    | 800,000                 |\n| WBTC.wh | 90%                | 139.94                   | 6         | $148,838      | 8                       |\n| xcUSDT  | 16%                | 1,864,992.00             | 1,300,000 | $1,300,000    | 950,000                 |\n| xcDOT   | 16%                | 2,539,465.31             | 26,000    | $137,800      | 53,000                  |\n| FRAX    | 20%                | 5,319,872.00             | 1,300,000 | $1,300,000    | 950,000                 |\n\n\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation.

      "title": "MIP-46 Updating Moonwell Apollo Governance quorum model",
      "content": "## Summary\nProposals require a minimum amount of participation to be considered valid by the DAO’s voting contract, this is referred to as the “quorum”. This proposal seeks to update the quorum calculations used for Moonwell Apollo MIPs (Moonwell Improvement Proposals) from a dynamic, “floating” quorum to a static quorum set to 40 million (MFAM), meaning that 40 million MFAM is the minimum amount of participation on a proposal for it to be considered valid. The current quorum’s rapid growth via the floating mechanism has hindered Gauntlet’s ability to manage risk due to multiple failed risk parameter adjustment proposals. The inability to reliably pass governance proposals that adjust risk parameters has the potential to introduce additional risk to the protocol. By updating to a static quorum model, like the one used in Moonwell Artemis Governance, Compound governance, and most other DAOs that exist, we can ensure that quorum requirements promote proposal credibility and sufficient community involvement without negatively affecting the security and continued growth of the protocol.\n\n## Definitions\n- Quorum: The minimum number of votes required for a governance proposal to pass.\n- Moonwell Apollo: The deployment of the Moonwell protocol on the Moonriver Network.\n- Moonwell Improvement Proposal: Binding, on-chain governance proposals with the capability of updating the protocol’s codebase.\n- Gauntlet Network: Specialists in risk management and economic simulations that contribute their expertise and knowledge to the Moonwell protocol and community.\n- Risk Parameter Update Proposals: Moonwell Improvement Proposals submitted by Gauntlet on a bi-monthly basis that update market parameters in order to mitigate risk to the protocol and increase capital efficiency.\n\n## Overview\nMoonwell Apollo governance currently utilizes a dynamic, “floating” quorum model, where the quorum increases after each successful vote and decreases when a vote doesn’t reach the required quorum. This differs from the static quorum of 100 million WELL tokens used in Moonwell Artemis Governance. As Moonwell Apollo and the broader Moonriver and Kusama ecosystems can act as a testing ground for new features and updates, the choice of a novel floating quorum model would theoretically allow the protocol to be safer as MFAM tokens enter circulation. However, after the recent failure of two Gauntlet proposals, including the recently submitted MIP-40, it seems that the dynamic model hasn’t achieved the intended goals and is introducing additional unnecessary risk to the community. As a result, this proposal would effectively change Apollo governance from a dynamic quorum to a static quorum, similar to the one used in Moonwell Artemis Governance, by adjusting the “quorum caps” to be a very narrow (1 MFAM) band.\n\nQuorum in Moonwell Apollo governance has rapidly increased from 20 million to approximately 56 million votes over the past 5 months. This proposal would update the quorum caps to a very narrow band around 40 million MFAM, striking a balance between relative ease of reaching quorum and minimizing risks to the protocol. Put simply, this adjustment aims to prevent essential proposals from failing due to a lack of participation, while also maintaining a high enough quorum to prevent low quality proposals from passing without adequate community involvement.\n\n## Motivation\nMoonwell Apollo’s floating quorum is preventing Gauntlet from effectively managing risk within the protocol. Two of their risk parameter adjustment proposals have been defeated, despite most votes being in favor, as they didn’t meet the required quorum threshold. Quorum should ideally serve as a minimum participation requirement rather than a gating mechanism. Its primary purpose in governance is to ensure proposal credibility and sufficient community engagement, which helps prevent harmful or low-quality proposals from passing. By adopting a static quorum model set at 40 million votes, Gauntlet and other trusted contributors submitting important proposals can more easily achieve approval, without putting the protocol at undue risk and reducing governance fatigue.\n\n## Implementation\nThe implementation of MIP-46 will involve simply calling the _setQuorumCaps function on the governor with the lower cap being 40M MFAM and the upper cap being 40M + 1 MFAM, effectively changing the quorum from a floating model which adjusts after every proposal, to a fixed quorum set at 40 million votes. I have collaborated with other Moonwell contributors to source and validate the proposed smart contract calls and their effects, ensuring that the proposed changes will work as intended.\n\n## Voting\nAll MFAM holders are encouraged to vote on this proposal. Voting options include:\n\n- For: Update the quorum used in Moonwell Apollo governance to a static 40 million votes\n- Against: Make no change\n- Abstain: Neither for nor against the change",

      "title": "MGP-3 Anthias.xyz x Moonwell Liquidation Health Tooling Grant Proposal",
      "content": "Title: MGP-3 [Anthias.xyz](https://www.anthias.xyz/) x Moonwell Liquidation Health Tooling Grant Proposal\nAuthor(s): 0xBroze + Anthias Team (0xBroze#1326 in Moonwell Discord)\nForum Discussion: https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/anthias-xyz-x-moonwell-liquidation-health-tooling-grant-proposal/461\nSubmission Date: April 24, 2023\n\n\n## Proposal Overview \n\n### Simple Summary\n\nThe Anthias team is proposing a grant to build a series of Moonwell-specific liquidation health dashboards for the Moonwell borrowing and lending markets. These analytics dashboards will exist for the Moonwell community, enabling stakeholders within the Moonwell borrowing & lending ecosystem to manage liquidation cascade risk and more. This analytics dashboard will be available for both Moonwell Artemis on Moonbeam and Moonwell Apollo on Moonriver, so all Moonwell users can more effectively monitor and manage liquidation risk. On top of this, we look forward to supporting the Base deployment of Moonwell as well and will integrate there too as part of this grant once that is launched. We look forward to building a long-term relationship with the Moonwellians and continually adding to these dashboards based on community feedback.\n\n### About Anthias + Abstract\n\nThe Anthias team is composed of three members of [Dartmouth Blockchain](https://dartmouthblockchain.com/). Our philosophy is to continually provide value to the blockchain ecosystem through shipping useful products and research. We have extensive experience in DeFi, having contributed at Primitive Finance, Yeti Finance, TempleDAO, and more. We have shipped multiple grants for [Euler](https://snapshot.org/#/eulerdao.eth/proposal/0x65a56c2a7f8ce23a814786517a4d4d1eb340f7ebc5058af47898aef23c36a04a) and [Aave](https://twitter.com/anthiasxyz/status/1643281017069813760?s=20) and have recently been approved for integrations with Compound V2 and V3 as well as Exactly Protocol.\n\nThis liquidation dashboard will improve the Moonwell stakeholder/token holder experience by allowing users to identify wallets close to liquidation on Moonwell and position themselves accordingly. The recent crash of May 2022 was caused largely by a series of liquidation cascades as large whale wallets were liquidated. As liquidators sold massive amounts of collateral on exchanges, collateral prices dropped, which resulted in more liquidations. We created Anthias to democratize liquidation health data of all wallets, so all users are able to manage liquidation risk more effectively.\n\n## Previous Work Showcase\n\n### Aave\n\n- We created our initial dashboard in June of 2022 to monitor liquidation health on Aave after the Terra/Luna collapse.\n- We completed our first grant for Aave in October of 2022. In this grant, we expanded our initial Aave dashboard to allow users to view historical liquidation health data in order to develop an even clearer picture around market risk.\n\n### Euler\n\n- We completed our first grant for Euler in September of 2022. This grant was to integrate our initial liquidation health dashboard with Euler.\n- Our second Euler grant was completed in January of 2023. With this grant, we expanded our tool suite for Euler to do Value at Risk monitoring and simulations, in-depth asset and health score filtering, and a more granular wallet view to show covariance among assets individual users were borrowing and supplying.\n\n### Compound\n\n- We were approved for our first integration with Compound V2 and V3 in March of 2023. This grant is to integrate our initial liquidation health dashboard with both Compound V2 and V3.\n\n### Exactly\n\n- We were approved for our first integration with Exactly Protocol in February of 2023. This grant is to integrate our initial liquidation health dashboard with Exactly on both Ethereum and Optimism.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThere are a number of risk vectors in borrowing and lending protocols, including smart contract risk, price oracle manipulation risk, governance / pool management risk, and market risk (liquidations + bad debt). As protocols like Moonwell continue to onboard more users, it is increasingly important to equip users with necessary risk-management analytics for healthy activity. Safeguarding users against risk ensures the long-term sustainability of the protocol, as well as an improved user experience (competitive differentiation with other borrowing and lending protocols).\n\nProjects like Gauntlet Network and RiskDAO have showcased what is possible with on-chain analytics for DeFi. On a longer term horizon, we hope to expand on previous projects in two ways: historical data and granular daily data. We will store various metrics (some already live at Anthias.xyz), including Aggregate Liquidation Health, Total Collateral Value at Risk, Wallets at Risk, and more. Users will be able to monitor the historical trends of these metrics, while also viewing granular breakdowns of these metrics per day. We see Anthias as a useful public good for various stakeholders within the Moonwell ecosystem to manage risk: the DAO governors, users (borrowers and lenders), and researchers. The Anthias team prides itself on making risk management tools usable by all stakeholders–we will continue that mission via these tools for the Moonwell community.\n\n## Specification & Implementation\n\nWe are proposing a grant to fund the development of integrating a Moonwell dashboard with Anthias.xyz for the Moonwell borrowing and lending market with the deliverables listed below:\n\n- Live metrics presented: Active Wallets, Wallets at Risk, and Aggregate Liquidation Score\n- Table view presented: Active Wallets (includes address, supply amount, borrow amount, and liquidation health)\n- Graph view presented: Active wallets (includes liquidation health and wallet size visualization)\n- The ability for users to download a CSV of the data presented in the Table View, so that data can be used in modeling\n- Wallet View that displays collateral and debt by asset for individual wallets\n\nThese deliverables will be live for Moonwell Artemis on Moonbeam and Moonwell Apollo on Moonriver as well as Moonwell on Base once that is live. \n\n### Cost\n\nThe cost of this integration for our team will be $17k upon completion of the dashboard. This payment will be used for the following costs:\n- Database storage ($500)\n- Server hosting ($50)\n- Nodes ($450)\n- Contributor compensation ($16,000)\n\nThe deliverables will be live at www.anthias.xyz/Moonwell. These dashboards will be live for 6 months at which point the community can determine whether it would like to fund the Anthias team on a per-quarter basis to maintain server costs.\n\nThis cost includes all the integrations specified above (Moonwell Artemis on Moonbeam, Moonwell Apollo on Moonriver, and Moonwell on Base once that is live).\n\n### How long will development take?\n\nWe estimate development time to take 6-7 weeks from approval. Based on feedback from community members, we plan to continue iterating and shipping out new and useful features.\n\n### Voting\n\n- Yes - I approve the proposal\n- No - I do not approve the proposal",

      "content": "## Artemis Summary\n\nWe recommend unpausing mint for the following markets:\n- GLMR\n- xcUSDT\n- xcDOT\n- FRAX\n- ETH.wh\n- BTC.wh\n- USDC.wh\n\nWe recommend the following risk parameter changes:\n\n- Decrease the xcDOT collateral factor from 64.0% to 63.0%.\n- Increase the xcUSDT collateral factor from 40.0% to 50.0%.\n- Increase USDC.wh borrow cap from 1,500,000 to 2,100,000.\n- Increase xcUSDT borrow cap from 1,000,000 to 1,200,000.\n\n## Rationale:\n\n#### Hundred finance Exploit Hack\nThere was an exploit to Hundred Finance, a Compound fork on the Optimism L2 over the weekend and Moonwell Pause Guardians paused supply to all Moonwell markets to protect the protocol from this novel exploit. At this current time, Gauntlet's analysis indicates that the recommended unpause assets are not at risk from this exploit.\n\nThe VaR is $0 and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. Our recommendations will increase LaR from $481k to $514k. xcUSDT is relatively safe from a market risk perspective, so we can gradually increased its collateral factor to improve capital efficiency.\n\nWETH.wh, WGLMR, WBTC.wh, FRAX, and USDC.wh's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\nxcDOT can be de-risked with relatively small impact in capital efficiency, so we recommend decreasing its collateral factor to reduce overall risk. xcDOT's 25% market depth on Stellaswap is at $338k while collateral usage for xcDOT on Artemis is $2.4M. As of now, we recommend reducing the collateral factor by 100 bps in order to prevent any liquidations which might impact user experience. Further reductions are expected to be recommended in the future.\n\nAs we make recommendations through our risk models, we keep a constant check on the market liquidity and concentration risk to the Artemis protocol. In this regard, we would like to present some key liquidity figures for Artemis assets to share with the community.\n\n| Asset   | Moonwell Concentration Risk | Total Circulating Supply | 25% Depth | 25% Depth USD |\n| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ | --------- | ------------- |\n| ETH.wh  | 84%                | 2,006.00                 | 110       | $209,848      |\n| USDC.wh | 60%                | 4,404,475.00             | 800,000   | $800,000      |\n| WBTC.wh | 83%                | 147.64                   | 8         | $239,198      |\n| xcUSDT  | 28%                | 1,585,145.00             | 950,000   | $950,000      |\n| xcDOT   | 46%                | 1,142,702.00             | 53,000    | $338,670      |\n| FRAX    | 10%                | 10,319,872.35            | 950,000   | $950,000      |\n\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. To learn more about our methodologies, please see the Helpful Links section at the bottom.\n\n## Supporting Data\n\nThe below figures show trends on key market statistics regarding borrows and utilization that we will continue to monitor:\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Aggregate Positions & Borrow Usages\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Mqcnc9n.png)\n\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Supply\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ocdVyFx.png)\n\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Borrows\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kQMDLCF.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tdyWjdX.png)\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/UYZp6F5.png)\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\nThe community should use [Gauntlet’s Artemis Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/artemis) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Artemis.\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TyrLrjM.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Quick Links\n\n*Please click below to learn about our methodologies:*\n\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

The LaR is $167k and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. Our recommendations will decrease borrow usage from 84.94% to 84.83%. ETH.multi has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $4.62k. USDT.multi has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $0. WMOVR has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $71.92k. xcKSM has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $94.14k. FRAX has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $78. USDC.multi has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $14.63k.\n\n\nSolarbeam (DEX) has experienced a large [outflow](https://analytics.solarbeam.io/tokens/0x1a93b23281cc1cde4c4741353f3064709a16197d) of FRAX liquidity since Jan 2023. FRAX's 25% market depth on Solarbeam is at $125k (8% increase since last rec) while collateral usage for FRAX on Apollo is $429k. With Moonriver DEXes having low FRAX liquidity for potential liquidations, Gauntlet recommends lowering collateral factors to reduce insolvency risk. This de-risking of FRAX will have a relatively small cost in capital efficiency.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GMgYeBy.png)\n\n\nUSDC.multi, ETH.multi, USDT.multi, WMOVR, and xcKSM's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\nGauntlet analyzes assets’ on-chain liquidity and potential risk of short market manipulation attack to assess borrow cap recommendations. With FRAX and USDT.multi's low borrow cap usage and decreasing liquidity on decentralize exchanges, we recommended lowering the caps to reduce risk.\n\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage.

We propose two new interest rate curves, one for stablecoins and one for non-stable assets.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe interest rate curves on Apollo and Artemis have not been changed over the lifespan of the protocols. Given the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet has evaluated assets on Moonwell and has identified an opportunity to overhaul the interest rate parameters of all the assets to benefit the protocol.\n\n# Background\n\nInterest rates are core to lending protocols like Apollo and Artemis. Without interest, suppliers have no reason to supply and borrowers have nothing stopping them from hoarding available borrows. Interest rates are set per asset, and are a function of the asset’s utilization (total amount borrowed divided by total amount supplied). All borrowable assets on Moonwell use a Jump Rate Model as this function, with an example interest rate curve for the Jump Rate Model shown below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Du13iLp.png)\n\nUnder the Jump Rate Model, the borrower interest rate slowly increases linearly with utilization until it hits a certain point (the “kink” in the curve), at which point it increases much faster with utilization. The 4 parameters defining this curve are:\n\n- Base: interest rate at 0 utilization\n- Multiplier: the slope of the curve below the kink\n- Kink: the utilization level at which the slope increases\n- Jump Multiplier: the slope of the curve above the kink\n\nAll the interest paid by borrowers is split between the suppliers (in the form of supplier interest) and the protocol reserves. This split is governed by the reserve factor parameter for an asset, which is the proportion of the interest that goes to the reserves while the rest goes to suppliers. Thus the supplier interest rate curve is defined in terms of the borrower interest rate curve, where the supplier interest rate is utilization * (borrower interest rate) * (1 - reserve factor).\n\nIt is important to note that these interest rates are separate from the token distribution incentives provided in the form of GLMR, WELL, MFAM, and MOVR. The APY from token distribution is added to the normal borrow or supply APY, which is computed as the Net APY and shown on the Moonwell frontend. At the moment, the token distribution incentives for many assets is greater than the standard borrow or supply rates. Within the context of this set of recs, our usage of the terms “borrower rate” and “supply rate” refer to the rates as defined above, and not the net APY rate. We kept the token distribution incentives in mind when making our rates, but do not propose any changes to them in this recommendation.\n\n## The Status Quo\n\nCurrently, all assets on Moonwell share the same interest rate curve:\n\n- Base: 0.02\n- Kink: 0.8\n- Multiplier: 0.1\n- Jump Multiplier: 1.09\n\nAs adjusted in our recent reserve factor recommendation, stablecoins on Moonwell use a reserve factor of 0.15 and all other assets use a reserve factor of 0.25. The table below shows the current borrow rate (BR) and supply rate (SR) for stablecoins and non-stablecoins at 0% utilization, 80% utilization (the kink), and 100% utilization.\n\n|         | Stablecoins | Non-Stablecoin |\n| ------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| 0% BR   | 2.00%       | 2.00%          |\n| 0% SR   | 0.00%       | 0.00%          |\n| Kink BR | 10.52%      | 10.52%         |\n| Kink SR | 8.94%       | 7.89%          |\n| 100% BR | 37.42%      | 37.42%         |\n| 100% SR | 31.81%      | 28.06%         |\n\n\n# Methodology\n\nAmong other factors, there are 2 main objectives to keep in mind when setting an interest rate curve:\n\n1. Mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool\n2. Maximize protocol reserve growth to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future\n\nOf these, mitigating the risk of 100% utilization is the most important. High utilization is poor UX for suppliers, as it can restrict their ability to withdraw an asset from the pool. For example, if a pool contains $10M in USDT, and $9M are loaned out, the maximum a supplier could withdraw is $1M since the pool cannot exceed 100% utilization. In addition to impacting suppliers, liquidations may be hindered because at 100% utilization only mTokens (not the underlying collateral) can be seized. If liquidators are concerned they won’t be able to cash these MTokens in for the underlying collateral in time to lock in a profit, this risks leaving the protocol with insolvent debt. Increasing interest rates can be used to motivate borrowers to repay the asset and motivate suppliers to deposit more of the asset. Both would decrease utilization to more desirable levels.\n\nThe second use case of building reserves is a little more opportunistic in nature. Reserves serve as the rainy day fund for protocols, protecting against unexpected tail-case events resulting in insolvencies. Over time they may also be used to fund operations, reducing the reliance on the native token treasury. Moreover, interest rates can be used opportunistically to capture increased reserves when specific market conditions are met. Opportunities present themselves when:\n\n1) Users are inelastic to interest rate changes AND/OR\n\n2) An outsized opportunity for yield exists in the market, such that borrowers would be willing to pay a higher premium on the asset (Moonwell can participate in a market upswing)\n\n# Motivation & Recommendations\n\nWe recommend using two new interest rate curves: one for stablecoins, and one for non-stable assets. Supplying stablecoins to a lending protocol is safer than supplying non-stablecoins because the value of the staked non-stablecoins will fluctuate over time. As such, it is expected that suppliers of non-stablecoins would expect a higher return than the suppliers of stablecoins. It is standard across peer lending protocols to have a split in interest rate curves between safer and less safe assets. Many protocols further differentiate between safer and less safe non-stablecoins, which we can consider for Moonwell in the future, but we consider our initial split to be a sufficent adjustment.\n\n## Non-Stablecoins\n\nFor non-stablecoins, we recommend the following parameters:\n\n- Base: 0.0\n- Kink: 0.6\n- Multiplier: 0.15\n- Jump Multiplier: 3.0\n\nThe chart below compares the proposed curve against the current one.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PQG84pJ.png)\n\nBorrow and supplier interest rates (BR and SR respectively) at 0% utilization, the kink, and 100% utilization are shown below.\n\n|         | Non-Stablecoin Recommended | Non-Stablecoin Current |\n| ------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| 0% BR   | 2.00%                      | 2.00%                  |\n| 0% SR   | 0.00%                      | 0.00%                  |\n| Kink BR | 11.63%                     | 10.52%                 |\n| Kink SR | 8.72%                      | 7.89%                  |\n| 100% BR | 269.75%                    | 37.42%                 |\n| 100% SR | 202.31%                    | 28.06%                 |\n\n\nAcross the board, we recommend higher interest rates for non-stablecoins. In particular, we are concerned that the interest rates at high levels of utilization are unusually low under the current interest rate curve. For peer protocols, the maximum interest rates for volatile assets were always in the hundreds. What is particularly concerning is that the maximum borrow rate is further offset by token distribution incentives, making the net borrow APY even lower. The danger of having maximum interest rates this low is that when utilization nears 100%, borrowers lack the incentive to lower the utilization rates by closing their positions and suppliers lack the incentive to lower utilization rates by increasing the supply. When looking at historical usage data for Apollo and Artemis, we indeed found that when utilization reached dangerously high levels, it took a long time for it to come back down to safer levels. As mentioned in the methodology section above, at high utilization levels with a long time window to return to normal utilization, the protocol is at an increase risk of added bad debt. The charts below show the time delay in hours for utilization to come back down to 85% after reaching 90% for several non-stablecoin assets:\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GpNN8Xl.png)\n\nAs such, we recommend raising the jump multiplier in order to raise this maximum rate, and lowering the kink in order to widen the buffer zone between the kink and 100% utilization. The small increase we suggest in the multiplier helps to increase rates across the board and also keeps the interest rates at the kink close to their current values.\n\n## Stablecoins\n\nFor stablecoins, we recommend the following parameters:\n\n- Base: 0.0\n- Kink: 0.8\n- Multiplier: 0.05\n- Jump Multiplier: 2.5\n\nThe chart below compares the proposed curve against the current one.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RaO95kn.png)\n\n\nBorrow and supplier interest rates (BR and SR respectively) at 0% utilization, the kink, and 100% utilization are shown below.\n\n|         | Stablecoin Recommended | Stablecoin Current |\n| ------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |\n| 0% BR   | 0.00%                  | 2.00%              |\n| 0% SR   | 0.00%                  | 0.00%              |\n| Kink BR | 4.08%                  | 10.52%             |\n| Kink SR | 3.47%                  | 8.94%              |\n| 100% BR | 71.53%                 | 37.42%             |\n| 100% SR | 60.80%                 | 31.81%             |\n\nOur recommended interest rate curve lowers the interest rate at lower utilization and raises it at higher utilization. This should push utilization closer to the kink point which results in better capital efficiency for the protocol. The interest rate at the kink under our proposal would be closer to market rates. Raising the jump multiplier will raise the maximum interest rates and will help protect Apollo and Artemis against 100% utilization.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe tables below summarize the proposed interest rate and reserve factor parameters, with changes denoted by an arrow.\n\nApollo\n| **Token** | **Base** | **Kink** | **Multiplier** | **Jump Multiplier** | **Reserve Factor** |\n| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |\n| FRAX      | 0.02→0   | 0.8      | 0.1→0.05       | 1.09→2.5            | 0.15               |\n| USDC      | 0.02→0   | 0.8      | 0.1→0.05       | 1.09→2.5            | 0.15               |\n| USDT      | 0.02→0   | 0.8      | 0.1→0.05       | 1.09→2.5            | 0.15               |\n| ETH       | 0.02     | 0.8→0.6  | 0.1→0.15       | 1.09→3              | 0.25               |\n| KSM       | 0.02     | 0.8→0.6  | 0.1→0.15       | 1.09→3              | 0.25               |\n| MOVR      | 0.02     | 0.8→0.6  | 0.1→0.15       | 1.09→3              | 0.25               |\n| WBTC      | 0.02     | 0.8→0.6  | 0.1→0.15       | 1.09→3              | 0.25               |\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the immediate estimated effects of these interest rate curve changes on the borrow and supply APY for each asset at its current level of utilization.

This proposal aims to create additional risk tooling for the community and further decentralize Moonwell’s risk management.\n\n# Overview\n## Motivation\n\nThe end goal of this proposal is to help improve the Moonwell ecosystem in the following areas: **risk management, transparency and decentralization**\n\n\n### Risk Management\n\nThrough our service and platform, we aim to improve market efficiency and have better control over risk, which we think is a clear benefit for the community. Our platform is free for everyone to use, allowing anyone in the community to run simulations, identify risk vectors and easily quantify those risks.\n\n\n### Transparency\n\nThe platform gives the community access to the complete picture of the Moonwell Apollo and Artemis systems through a comprehensive user experience. It also allows understanding how risk may impact one’s portfolio. \n\n\n### Decentralization\n\nThe tools are available to everyone for free so anyone can use them to propose risk parameter updates and measure the impact of any proposed change. Warden empowers everyone in the DeFi community to make data-driven risk decisions. \n\n\n## About Warden Finance\n\nWarden helps DeFi protocols identify and manage risks. With the help of our [open risk & analytics platform](http://warden.finance), we propose parameter recommendations based on our in-house research, participate in governance, and build custom risk tools.\n\nWarden has been contributing to DeFi since 2021. So far, we have collaborated with Euler, Notional, Morpho, Compound, AAVE, Uniswap, Instadapp and Olympus helping protocols surface data in a meaningful way through an extensive set of dashboards, subgraphs and data extraction tools.\n\nThe Warden platform encompasses a set of tools for exploring DeFi accounts, running simulations, backtesting strategies and stress-testing protocols. Warden empowers everyone in the DeFi community to make data-driven risk decisions.\n\n\n# Implementation\n\n\n## Tooling and infrastructure\n\nThe Warden Finance team will take charge of implementing the Moonwell Apollo, Artemis and Base integration to the Warden Finance platform. \n\nThe team will also take care of hosting, maintenance and support for the users.\n\n\n## Risk management service\n\n### Monthly risk assessment reports & recommendations reviews\n\nWe will provide assessment of parameters on a monthly basis for the following parameters:\n\n* Collateral factor\n* Borrow cap\n* Liquidation incentive / close factor\n* Interest Rate Models (base rate, kink rate, max rate, kink utilization, reserve fees)\n* Treasury (harvesting decisions & adjacent recommendations)\n\nWe will review recommendations from other contributors such as Gauntlet by assessing the output against our model, and provide adjustments if needed.\n\n\n### Onboarding Moonwell on Base \n\nIn order to help Moonwell with bootstrapping on Base, we will publish a full analysis providing the following recommendations:\n\n* Suggested set of assets to be onboarded, along with an analysis of all of the risk-related metrics for each of them (oracles, volatility, slippage, dex liquidity, …)\n* Recommended parameters for each of those assets\n\n\n# Budget, timeline & payments\n\n**Timeline:** Moonwell Artemis and Apollo integrations on the Warden Finance platform will be available within 4 weeks after the proposal is accepted.\n\n**Budget:** $62.5k per quarter. With the first payment paid up front to cover for initial development costs.\n\n**Period:** April 2023 to April 2024 (1 year)\n\n**Payment:** We are requesting a payment of $62.5K for the first quarter (April-June 2023).\n\nThe exchange rate of WELL/USD used will be the 7-day time-weighted average price (TWAP) prior to the date the proposal is submitted for the on-chain vote. The price source will be the close price of WELL published by CoinGecko. Calculations for the 7-Day TWAP can be seen through the following [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WSJx_6W6pDVJEyNssf0GDQvR0L344z27XtQ4agZsbJM/edit#gid=0).\n\nWe will post quarterly updates on what we have delivered to the DAO and post monthly risk assessments on the Forum.\n\n",

The LaR is $167k and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. ETH.multi has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $12.89k. USDT.multi has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $0. WMOVR has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $81k. xcKSM has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $72k. FRAX and USDC.multi both have a VaR and LaR of $0.\n\n\nSolarbeam (DEX) has experienced a large [outflow](https://analytics.solarbeam.io/tokens/0x1a93b23281cc1cde4c4741353f3064709a16197d) of FRAX liquidity since Jan 2023. FRAX's 25% market depth on Soalrbeam is at $115k while collateral usage for FRAX on Apollo is $416k. With Moonriver DEXes having low FRAX liquidity for potential liquidations, Gauntlet recommends lowering collateral factors to reduce insolvency risk. This de-risking of FRAX will have a relatively small cost in capital efficiency.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JiukwQ9.png)\n\n\nUSDC.multi, ETH.multi, USDT.multi, WMOVR, and xcKSM's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\nGauntlet analyzes assets’ on-chain liquidity and potential risk of short market manipulation attack to assess borrow cap recommendations. With FRAX and USDT.multi's low borrow cap usage and decreasing liquidity on decentralize exchanges, we recommended lowering the caps to minimize risk.\n\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. To learn more about our methodologies, please see the Helpful Links section at the bottom.\n\n## Supporting Data\n\nThe below figures show trends on key market statistics regarding borrows and utilization that we will continue to monitor:\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Aggregate Positions & Borrow Usages\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XU4LvK0.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Supply\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Gk4ClVj.png)\n\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Borrows\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YRwIyhG.png)\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/e3aMBLR.png)\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XZHPyje.png)\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\nThe community should use [Gauntlet’s Apollo Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/apollo) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Apollo.\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gQUQ6w1.png)\n\n\n\n\n## Simple Summary\n\nGauntlet presents a proposal to update the interest rate parameters for all active assets on Apollo. We propose two new interest rate curves, one for stablecoins and one for non-stable assets.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe interest rate curves on Apollo and Artemis have not been changed over the lifespan of the protocols. Given the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet has evaluated assets on Moonwell and has identified an opportunity to overhaul the interest rate parameters of all the assets to benefit the protocol.\n\n# Background\n\nInterest rates are core to lending protocols like Apollo and Artemis. Without interest, suppliers have no reason to supply and borrowers have nothing stopping them from hoarding available borrows. Interest rates are set per asset, and are a function of the asset’s utilization (total amount borrowed divided by total amount supplied). All borrowable assets on Moonwell use a Jump Rate Model as this function, with an example interest rate curve for the Jump Rate Model shown below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Du13iLp.png)\n\nUnder the Jump Rate Model, the borrower interest rate slowly increases linearly with utilization until it hits a certain point (the “kink” in the curve), at which point it increases much faster with utilization. The 4 parameters defining this curve are:\n\n- Base: interest rate at 0 utilization\n- Multiplier: the slope of the curve below the kink\n- Kink: the utilization level at which the slope increases\n- Jump Multiplier: the slope of the curve above the kink\n\nAll the interest paid by borrowers is split between the suppliers (in the form of supplier interest) and the protocol reserves. This split is governed by the reserve factor parameter for an asset, which is the proportion of the interest that goes to the reserves while the rest goes to suppliers. Thus the supplier interest rate curve is defined in terms of the borrower interest rate curve, where the supplier interest rate is utilization * (borrower interest rate) * (1 - reserve factor).\n\nIt is important to note that these interest rates are separate from the token distribution incentives provided in the form of GLMR, WELL, MFAM, and MOVR. The APY from token distribution is added to the normal borrow or supply APY, which is computed as the Net APY and shown on the Moonwell frontend. At the moment, the token distribution incentives for many assets is greater than the standard borrow or supply rates. Within the context of this set of recs, our usage of the terms “borrower rate” and “supply rate” refer to the rates as defined above, and not the net APY rate. We kept the token distribution incentives in mind when making our rates, but do not propose any changes to them in this recommendation.\n\n## The Status Quo\n\nCurrently, all assets on Moonwell share the same interest rate curve:\n\n- Base: 0.02\n- Kink: 0.8\n- Multiplier: 0.1\n- Jump Multiplier: 1.09\n\nAs adjusted in our recent reserve factor recommendation, stablecoins on Moonwell use a reserve factor of 0.15 and all other assets use a reserve factor of 0.25. The table below shows the current borrow rate (BR) and supply rate (SR) for stablecoins and non-stablecoins at 0% utilization, 80% utilization (the kink), and 100% utilization.\n\n|         | Stablecoins | Non-Stablecoin |\n| ------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| 0% BR   | 2.00%       | 2.00%          |\n| 0% SR   | 0.00%       | 0.00%          |\n| Kink BR | 10.52%      | 10.52%         |\n| Kink SR | 8.94%       | 7.89%          |\n| 100% BR | 37.42%      | 37.42%         |\n| 100% SR | 31.81%      | 28.06%         |\n\n\n# Methodology\n\nAmong other factors, there are 2 main objectives to keep in mind when setting an interest rate curve:\n\n1. Mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool\n2. Maximize protocol reserve growth to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future\n\nOf these, mitigating the risk of 100% utilization is the most important. High utilization is poor UX for suppliers, as it can restrict their ability to withdraw an asset from the pool. For example, if a pool contains $10M in USDT, and $9M are loaned out, the maximum a supplier could withdraw is $1M since the pool cannot exceed 100% utilization. In addition to impacting suppliers, liquidations may be hindered because at 100% utilization only mTokens (not the underlying collateral) can be seized. If liquidators are concerned they won’t be able to cash these MTokens in for the underlying collateral in time to lock in a profit, this risks leaving the protocol with insolvent debt. Increasing interest rates can be used to motivate borrowers to repay the asset and motivate suppliers to deposit more of the asset. Both would decrease utilization to more desirable levels.\n\nThe second use case of building reserves is a little more opportunistic in nature. Reserves serve as the rainy day fund for protocols, protecting against unexpected tail-case events resulting in insolvencies. Over time they may also be used to fund operations, reducing the reliance on the native token treasury. Moreover, interest rates can be used opportunistically to capture increased reserves when specific market conditions are met. Opportunities present themselves when:\n\n1) Users are inelastic to interest rate changes AND/OR\n\n2) An outsized opportunity for yield exists in the market, such that borrowers would be willing to pay a higher premium on the asset (Moonwell can participate in a market upswing)\n\n# Motivation & Recommendations\n\nWe recommend using two new interest rate curves: one for stablecoins, and one for non-stable assets. Supplying stablecoins to a lending protocol is safer than supplying non-stablecoins because the value of the staked non-stablecoins will fluctuate over time. As such, it is expected that suppliers of non-stablecoins would expect a higher return than the suppliers of stablecoins. It is standard across peer lending protocols to have a split in interest rate curves between safer and less safe assets. Many protocols further differentiate between safer and less safe non-stablecoins, which we can consider for Moonwell in the future, but we consider our initial split to be a sufficent adjustment.\n\n## Non-Stablecoins\n\nFor non-stablecoins, we recommend the following parameters:\n\n- Base: 0.0\n- Kink: 0.6\n- Multiplier: 0.15\n- Jump Multiplier: 3.0\n\nThe chart below compares the proposed curve against the current one.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PQG84pJ.png)\n\nBorrow and supplier interest rates (BR and SR respectively) at 0% utilization, the kink, and 100% utilization are shown below.\n\n|         | Non-Stablecoin Recommended | Non-Stablecoin Current |\n| ------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| 0% BR   | 2.00%                      | 2.00%                  |\n| 0% SR   | 0.00%                      | 0.00%                  |\n| Kink BR | 11.63%                     | 10.52%                 |\n| Kink SR | 8.72%                      | 7.89%                  |\n| 100% BR | 269.75%                    | 37.42%                 |\n| 100% SR | 202.31%                    | 28.06%                 |\n\n\nAcross the board, we recommend higher interest rates for non-stablecoins. In particular, we are concerned that the interest rates at high levels of utilization are unusually low under the current interest rate curve. For peer protocols, the maximum interest rates for volatile assets were always in the hundreds. What is particularly concerning is that the maximum borrow rate is further offset by token distribution incentives, making the net borrow APY even lower. The danger of having maximum interest rates this low is that when utilization nears 100%, borrowers lack the incentive to lower the utilization rates by closing their positions and suppliers lack the incentive to lower utilization rates by increasing the supply. When looking at historical usage data for Apollo and Artemis, we indeed found that when utilization reached dangerously high levels, it took a long time for it to come back down to safer levels. As mentioned in the methodology section above, at high utilization levels with a long time window to return to normal utilization, the protocol is at an increase risk of added bad debt. The charts below show the time delay in hours for utilization to come back down to 85% after reaching 90% for several non-stablecoin assets:\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GpNN8Xl.png)\n\nAs such, we recommend raising the jump multiplier in order to raise this maximum rate, and lowering the kink in order to widen the buffer zone between the kink and 100% utilization. The small increase we suggest in the multiplier helps to increase rates across the board and also keeps the interest rates at the kink close to their current values.\n\n## Stablecoins\n\nFor stablecoins, we recommend the following parameters:\n\n- Base: 0.0\n- Kink: 0.8\n- Multiplier: 0.05\n- Jump Multiplier: 2.5\n\nThe chart below compares the proposed curve against the current one.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RaO95kn.png)\n\n\nBorrow and supplier interest rates (BR and SR respectively) at 0% utilization, the kink, and 100% utilization are shown below.\n\n|         | Stablecoin Recommended | Stablecoin Current |\n| ------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |\n| 0% BR   | 0.00%                  | 2.00%              |\n| 0% SR   | 0.00%                  | 0.00%              |\n| Kink BR | 4.08%                  | 10.52%             |\n| Kink SR | 3.47%                  | 8.94%              |\n| 100% BR | 71.53%                 | 37.42%             |\n| 100% SR | 60.80%                 | 31.81%             |\n\nOur recommended interest rate curve lowers the interest rate at lower utilization and raises it at higher utilization. This should push utilization closer to the kink point which results in better capital efficiency for the protocol. The interest rate at the kink under our proposal would be closer to market rates given by stablecoin staking on peer protocols. Raising the jump multiplier will raise the maximum interest rates and will help protect Apollo and Artemis against 100% utilization.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe tables below summarize the proposed interest rate and reserve factor parameters, with changes denoted by an arrow.\n\nApollo\n| **Token** | **Base** | **Kink** | **Multiplier** | **Jump Multiplier** | **Reserve Factor** |\n| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |\n| FRAX      | 0.02→0   | 0.8      | 0.1→0.05       | 1.09→2.5            | 0.15               |\n| USDC      | 0.02→0   | 0.8      | 0.1→0.05       | 1.09→2.5            | 0.15               |\n| USDT      | 0.02→0   | 0.8      | 0.1→0.05       | 1.09→2.5            | 0.15               |\n| ETH       | 0.02     | 0.8→0.6  | 0.1→0.15       | 1.09→3              | 0.25               |\n| KSM       | 0.02     | 0.8→0.6  | 0.1→0.15       | 1.09→3              | 0.25               |\n| MOVR      | 0.02     | 0.8→0.6  | 0.1→0.15       | 1.09→3              | 0.25               |\n| WBTC      | 0.02     | 0.8→0.6  | 0.1→0.15       | 1.09→3              | 0.25               |\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the immediate estimated effects of these interest rate curve changes on the borrow and supply APY for each asset at its current level of utilization.

Our recommendations will increase LaR from $380k to $387k. USDC.wh and xcUSDT are relatively safe from a market risk perspective, so can have their collateral factors gradually increased to improve capital efficiency.\n\nWETH.wh, WGLMR, WBTC.wh, and xcDOT's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\nFRAX can be de-risked with relatively small impact in capital efficiency, so we recommend decreasing its collateral factor to reduce overall risk. FRAX's 25% market depth on Stellaswap is at $910k while collateral usage for FRAX on Artemis is $2.4M. The below chart exhibits the top 10 FRAX suppliers' borrow positions. The 2nd and 3rd largest suppliers are borrowing volatile assets WBTC and WGLMR totaling around $1M. These positions have relatively safe borrow usage at below 76% but could further increase their borrow postion in the future. As of now, we recommend reducing the collateral factor by 50 bps in order to prevent any liquidations which might impact user experience. Further reductions are expected to be recommended in the future.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6a7JOHH.png)\n\n**BUSD Deprecation**\nAs shared in the **[MIP 29/30] Risk Parameter Updates (2023-02-20)** [post](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/mip-29-30-risk-parameter-updates-2023-02-20/385), Gauntlet is continuing to disable collateral enablement for BUSD by lowering the Collateral Factor from 5% to 0%.\n\n| CF Reduction                             | .05→0   |\n| ---------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| Estimated Liquidation ($) Impact                   | $50        |\n| Estimated Liquidation Accounts Total Supply Impact | 0        |\n| Estimated Active Collateral Usage ($)    | $680     |\n\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. To learn more about our methodologies, please see the Helpful Links section at the bottom.\n\n## Supporting Data\n\nThe below figures show trends on key market statistics regarding borrows and utilization that we will continue to monitor:\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Aggregate Positions & Borrow Usages\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BJ9JCs5.png)\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Supply\n![](https://i.imgur.com/l5FNX9I.png)\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Borrows\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MTt5N4e.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/W27EhnT.png)\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JGAlLRw.png)\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\nThe community should use [Gauntlet’s Artemis Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/artemis) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Artemis.\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9BouNKF.png)\n\n\n\nSimple Summary\n\nGauntlet presents a proposal to update the interest rate parameters for all active assets on both Apollo and Artemis. We propose two new interest rate curves, one for stablecoins and one for non-stable assets.\n\n# Abstract\n\nThe interest rate curves on Apollo and Artemis have not been changed over the lifespan of the protocols. Given the significant shifts in crypto markets, Gauntlet has evaluated assets on Moonwell and has identified an opportunity to overhaul the interest rate parameters of all the assets to benefit the protocol.\n\n# Background\n\nInterest rates are core to lending protocols like Apollo and Artemis. Without interest, suppliers have no reason to supply and borrowers have nothing stopping them from hoarding available borrows. Interest rates are set per asset, and are a function of the asset’s utilization (total amount borrowed divided by total amount supplied). All borrowable assets on Moonwell use a Jump Rate Model as this function, with an example interest rate curve for the Jump Rate Model shown below.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Du13iLp.png)\n\nUnder the Jump Rate Model, the borrower interest rate slowly increases linearly with utilization until it hits a certain point (the “kink” in the curve), at which point it increases much faster with utilization. The 4 parameters defining this curve are:\n\n- Base: interest rate at 0 utilization\n- Multiplier: the slope of the curve below the kink\n- Kink: the utilization level at which the slope increases\n- Jump Multiplier: the slope of the curve above the kink\n\nAll the interest paid by borrowers is split between the suppliers (in the form of supplier interest) and the protocol reserves. This split is governed by the reserve factor parameter for an asset, which is the proportion of the interest that goes to the reserves while the rest goes to suppliers. Thus the supplier interest rate curve is defined in terms of the borrower interest rate curve, where the supplier interest rate is utilization * (borrower interest rate) * (1 - reserve factor).\n\nIt is important to note that these interest rates are separate from the token distribution incentives provided in the form of GLMR, WELL, MFAM, and MOVR. The APY from token distribution is added to the normal borrow or supply APY, which is computed as the Net APY and shown on the Moonwell frontend. At the moment, the token distribution incentives for many assets is greater than the standard borrow or supply rates. Within the context of this set of recs, our usage of the terms “borrower rate” and “supply rate” refer to the rates as defined above, and not the net APY rate. We kept the token distribution incentives in mind when making our rates, but do not propose any changes to them in this recommendation.\n\n## The Status Quo\n\nCurrently, all assets on Moonwell share the same interest rate curve:\n\n- Base: 0.02\n- Kink: 0.8\n- Multiplier: 0.1\n- Jump Multiplier: 1.09\n\nAs adjusted in our recent reserve factor recommendation, stablecoins on Moonwell use a reserve factor of 0.15 and all other assets use a reserve factor of 0.25. The table below shows the current borrow rate (BR) and supply rate (SR) for stablecoins and non-stablecoins at 0% utilization, 80% utilization (the kink), and 100% utilization.\n\n|         | Stablecoins | Non-Stablecoin |\n| ------- | ----------- | -------------- |\n| 0% BR   | 2.00%       | 2.00%          |\n| 0% SR   | 0.00%       | 0.00%          |\n| Kink BR | 10.52%      | 10.52%         |\n| Kink SR | 8.94%       | 7.89%          |\n| 100% BR | 37.42%      | 37.42%         |\n| 100% SR | 31.81%      | 28.06%         |\n\n\n# Methodology\n\nAmong other factors, there are 2 main objectives to keep in mind when setting an interest rate curve:\n\n1. Mitigate the risk of 100% utilization in a pool\n2. Maximize protocol reserve growth to cover insolvencies or other expenses in the future\n\nOf these, mitigating the risk of 100% utilization is the most important. High utilization is poor UX for suppliers, as it can restrict their ability to withdraw an asset from the pool. For example, if a pool contains $10M in USDT, and $9M are loaned out, the maximum a supplier could withdraw is $1M since the pool cannot exceed 100% utilization. In addition to impacting suppliers, liquidations may be hindered because at 100% utilization only mTokens (not the underlying collateral) can be seized. If liquidators are concerned they won’t be able to cash these MTokens in for the underlying collateral in time to lock in a profit, this risks leaving the protocol with insolvent debt. Increasing interest rates can be used to motivate borrowers to repay the asset and motivate suppliers to deposit more of the asset. Both would decrease utilization to more desirable levels.\n\nThe second use case of building reserves is a little more opportunistic in nature. Reserves serve as the rainy day fund for protocols, protecting against unexpected tail-case events resulting in insolvencies. Over time they may also be used to fund operations, reducing the reliance on the native token treasury. Moreover, interest rates can be used opportunistically to capture increased reserves when specific market conditions are met. Opportunities present themselves when:\n\n1) Users are inelastic to interest rate changes AND/OR\n\n2) An outsized opportunity for yield exists in the market, such that borrowers would be willing to pay a higher premium on the asset (Moonwell can participate in a market upswing)\n\n# Motivation & Recommendations\n\nWe recommend using two new interest rate curves: one for stablecoins, and one for non-stable assets. Supplying stablecoins to a lending protocol is safer than supplying non-stablecoins because the value of the staked non-stablecoins will fluctuate over time. As such, it is expected that suppliers of non-stablecoins would expect a higher return than the suppliers of stablecoins. It is standard across peer lending protocols to have a split in interest rate curves between safer and less safe assets. Many protocols further differentiate between safer and less safe non-stablecoins, which we can consider for Moonwell in the future, but we consider our initial split to be a sufficent adjustment.\n\n## Non-Stablecoins\n\nFor non-stablecoins, we recommend the following parameters:\n\n- Base: 0.0\n- Kink: 0.6\n- Multiplier: 0.15\n- Jump Multiplier: 3.0\n\nThe chart below compares the proposed curve against the current one.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/PQG84pJ.png)\n\nBorrow and supplier interest rates (BR and SR respectively) at 0% utilization, the kink, and 100% utilization are shown below.\n\n|         | Non-Stablecoin Recommended | Non-Stablecoin Current |\n| ------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------- |\n| 0% BR   | 2.00%                      | 2.00%                  |\n| 0% SR   | 0.00%                      | 0.00%                  |\n| Kink BR | 11.63%                     | 10.52%                 |\n| Kink SR | 8.72%                      | 7.89%                  |\n| 100% BR | 269.75%                    | 37.42%                 |\n| 100% SR | 202.31%                    | 28.06%                 |\n\n\nAcross the board, we recommend higher interest rates for non-stablecoins. In particular, we are concerned that the interest rates at high levels of utilization are unusually low under the current interest rate curve. For peer protocols, the maximum interest rates for volatile assets were always in the hundreds. What is particularly concerning is that the maximum borrow rate is further offset by token distribution incentives, making the net borrow APY even lower. The danger of having maximum interest rates this low is that when utilization nears 100%, borrowers lack the incentive to lower the utilization rates by closing their positions and suppliers lack the incentive to lower utilization rates by increasing the supply. When looking at historical usage data for Apollo and Artemis, we indeed found that when utilization reached dangerously high levels, it took a long time for it to come back down to safer levels. As mentioned in the methodology section above, at high utilization levels with a long time window to return to normal utilization, the protocol is at an increase risk of added bad debt. The charts below show the time delay in hours for utilization to come back down to 85% after reaching 90% for several non-stablecoin assets:\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GpNN8Xl.png)\n\nAs such, we recommend raising the jump multiplier in order to raise this maximum rate, and lowering the kink in order to widen the buffer zone between the kink and 100% utilization. The small increase we suggest in the multiplier helps to increase rates across the board and also keeps the interest rates at the kink close to their current values.\n\n## Stablecoins\n\nFor stablecoins, we recommend the following parameters:\n\n- Base: 0.0\n- Kink: 0.8\n- Multiplier: 0.05\n- Jump Multiplier: 2.5\n\nThe chart below compares the proposed curve against the current one.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RaO95kn.png)\n\n\nBorrow and supplier interest rates (BR and SR respectively) at 0% utilization, the kink, and 100% utilization are shown below.\n\n|         | Stablecoin Recommended | Stablecoin Current |\n| ------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |\n| 0% BR   | 0.00%                  | 2.00%              |\n| 0% SR   | 0.00%                  | 0.00%              |\n| Kink BR | 4.08%                  | 10.52%             |\n| Kink SR | 3.47%                  | 8.94%              |\n| 100% BR | 71.53%                 | 37.42%             |\n| 100% SR | 60.80%                 | 31.81%             |\n\nOur recommended interest rate curve lowers the interest rate at lower utilization and raises it at higher utilization. This should push utilization closer to the kink point which results in better capital efficiency for the protocol. The interest rate at the kink under our proposal would be closer to market rates. Raising the jump multiplier will raise the maximum interest rates to levels that are more in line with other protocols, and will help protect Apollo and Artemis against 100% utilization.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe tables below summarize the proposed interest rate and reserve factor parameters, with changes denoted by an arrow.\n\n\nArtemis\n\n| **Token** | **Base** | **Kink** | **Multiplier** | **Jump Multiplier** | **Reserve Factor** |\n| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |\n| FRAX      | 0.02→0   | 0.8      | 0.1→0.05       | 1.09→2.5            | 0.15               |\n| USDC.wh   | 0.02→0   | 0.8      | 0.1→0.05       | 1.09→2.5            | 0.15               |\n| USDT      | 0.02→0   | 0.8      | 0.1→0.05       | 1.09→2.5            | 0.15               |\n| DOT       | 0.02     | 0.8→0.6  | 0.1→0.15       | 1.09→3              | 0.25               |\n| ETH.wh    | 0.02     | 0.8→0.6  | 0.1→0.15       | 1.09→3              | 0.25               |\n| GLMR      | 0.02     | 0.8→0.6  | 0.1→0.15       | 1.09→3              | 0.25               |\n| WBTC.wh   | 0.02     | 0.8→0.6  | 0.1→0.15       | 1.09→3              | 0.25               |\n\n\nThe table below shows the immediate estimated effects of these interest rate curve changes on the borrow and supply APY for each asset at its current level of utilization.

      "content": "\nTitle: Warden Finance Risk & Tooling Grant Proposal\nAuthor(s): Hugo Boisselle-Morin <hugo@shippooor.xyz>\nRelated Discussions: - https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/mip-39-activate-moonwell-on-base-mainnet/414\nSubmission Date: 2023-04-03\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to formalize how Warden would support Moonwell in the following areas:\n\n* Tooling and infrastructure - Support Moonwell Artemis, Apollo and Moonwell on Base chain on the [Warden Finance risk & analytics platform](https://www.warden.finance/), giving free access to advanced protocol exploration and risk tooling to the community.\n* Risk management service - Governance parameters recommendations and help with onboarding Moonwell on Base chain\n\nWe have discussed this proposal with contributors from Lunar Labs. This proposal aims to create additional risk tooling for the community and further decentralize Moonwell’s risk management.\n\n## Overview\n\n### Tooling and infrastructure\n\nBy giving Moonwell users access to the Warden Finance risk & analytics platform, the community will have access to the following capabilities: \n\n\n#### Explore\n\n* **Search and browse everything ([link](https://www.warden.finance/accounts?protocols=Aave&protocols=Euler&protocols=morpho_compound&protocols=morpho_aave&protocols=compound_v3))** - Explore all Moonwell accounts, complete transactions history and liquidations through a smooth UI and powerful search, filter and sort capabilities. Here are a few concrete examples:\n    * Search accounts by strategy (i.e long USDC and short ETH)\n    * Filter transactions by specific asset and date range (i.e USDC liquidations during depeg event).\n* **In-depth account details ([link](https://www.warden.finance/accounts/0x777777c9898d384f785ee44acfe945efdff5f3e0))**- Access details about any account’s health and history. See any account’s historical net worth, profit & loss, portfolio, health metrics and liquidation prices for all assets in the portfolio.\n\n\n#### Simulate\n\n* **Self-serve risk management** - Measure the exact impact of any market conditions and governance parameter change on your account’s health using the Warden simulation engine.\n* **Risk manager tooling ([link](https://www.warden.finance/liquidation-backtesting))** - Open access to the tools that our team uses to measure risk and provide recommendations. (Liquidation prices, Collateral at Risk, Liquidation Backtesting, Asset Risk Assessments)  \n* **Asset onboarding and monitoring dashboards ([link](https://www.warden.finance/tokens/COMP))** - For every major assets on Moonbeam. Moonriver and Base, measure the following risk metrics in real time:\n    * Oracle price vs market price feed\n    * Volatility metrics (i.e max downturn, daily volatility)\n    * Slippage\n    * List of all dex pools\n    * Historical dex liquidity\n    * Holders concentration.\n\n\n### Risk management service\n\nIn complement to the tooling, the Warden Finance team is proposing to offer the following services:\n\n* Propose governance parameter recommendations for CF, IRMs, borrow and supply caps that aim to provide a trade-off between the two following poles:\n    1. Improve market efficiency\n    2. Maintain level of risk exposure that is desirable by the community\n* Review parameter recommendations from other contributors such as Gauntlet by assessing the output against our model. \n* Publish a full analysis recommending an initial set of assets and parameters for onboarding Moonwell on Base chain.\n\n## Motivation\n\n### How this proposal will help Moonwell\n\nThe end goal of this proposal is to help improve the Moonwell ecosystem in the following areas: **risk management, transparency and decentralization**\n\n#### Risk Management\n\nThrough our service and platform, we aim to improve market efficiency and have better control over risk, which we think is a clear benefit for the community. Our platform is free for everyone to use, allowing anyone in the community to run simulations, identify risk vectors and easily quantify those risks.\n\n\n#### Transparency\n\nThe platform gives the community access to the complete picture of the Moonwell Apollo and Artemis systems through a comprehensive user experience. It also allows understanding how risk may impact one’s portfolio in a way humans can comprehend. \n\n\n#### Decentralization\n\nThe tools are available to everyone for free so anyone can use them to propose risk parameter updates and measure the impact of any proposed change. Warden empowers everyone in the DeFi community to make data-driven risk decisions. \n\n\n### About Warden Finance\n\nWarden helps DeFi protocols identify and manage risks. With the help of our [open risk & analytics platform](http://warden.finance), we propose parameter recommendations based on our in-house research, participate in governance, and build custom risk tools.\n\nWarden has been contributing to DeFi since 2021. So far, we have collaborated with Euler, Notional, Morpho, Compound, AAVE, Uniswap, Instadapp and Olympus protocols. We started as builders, helping protocols surface data in a meaningful way through an extensive set of dashboards, subgraphs and data extraction tools.\n\n\n* [Warden Finance - Risk & Analytics Platform for DeFi](https://www.warden.finance/)\n* [Dune Analytics Dashboards](https://dune.com/shippooordao)\n* [Notional Info Dashboard](https://info.notional.finance/)\n* [Uniswap Subgraph Extractor](https://www.warden.finance/export/extractooor/uniswap?chain=Ethereum&table=uniswapDayDatas)\n* [Euler Sugraph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/euler-xyz/euler-mainnet)\n\nThe Warden Finance platform was released in Q4 2022 as part of a risk & tooling partnership with the Euler protocol.\n\nThe platform encompasses a set of tools for exploring DeFi accounts, running simulations, backtesting strategies and stress-testing protocols. Warden empowers everyone in the DeFi community to make data-driven risk decisions.\n\nWe also are active DAO contributors and delegates. We are delegates on Morpho and Euler. We review governance proposals and provide recommendations for our areas of expertise (tech, risk, data science). We are active forum contributors. Here are a few recent notable contributions:\n\n\n\n* [Euler - eIP 47 - Promote rETH to collateral tier](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-47-promote-reth-to-collateral-tier-contingent-on-chainlink-deploying-a-proper-oracle/525)\n* [Euler - eIP 52 - Update IRM models for wstETH, cbETH & rETH](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-52-update-the-irm-models-for-wsteth-cbeth-reth/673)\n* [Euler - Stablecoin Depeg Event Thread](https://forum.euler.finance/t/stablecoins-depeg-event-thread/868)\n\n\n### Our Values\n\n**Transparency**. In the best interest of the community, our platform will always be accessible and open for feedback. We have created tools that are accessible to the public in order to make our proposals as transparent and cohesive as possible.\n\n**Data-driven**. Every recommendation we make is based on cold hard data that is accessible and verifiable by anyone. Through the Warden Finance platform, we carry a holistic picture of the protocol and can accurately measure the impact of any change in the system.\n\n**Quality**. Risk management is mission critical for protocols, and we believe the tools and recommendations should live up to that standard. We build products that are made to be used and meant to be trusted.\n\n\n## Implementation\n\n\n### Tooling and infrastructure\n\nThe Warden Finance team will take charge of implementing the Moonwell Apollo, Artemis and Base integration to the Warden Finance platform. \n\nThe team will also take care of hosting, maintenance and support for the users.\n\n\n### Risk management service\n\n\n#### Monthly risk assessment reports & recommendations reviews\n\nWe will provide recommendations on a monthly basis for the following parameters:\n\n* Collateral factor\n* Borrow cap\n* Liquidation incentive / close factor\n* Interest Rate Models (base rate, kink rate, max rate, kink utilization, reserve fees)\n* Treasury (harvesting decisions & adjacent recommendations)\n\nWe will review recommendations from other contributors such as Gauntlet by assessing the output against our model, and provide adjustments if needed.\n\n\n#### Onboarding Moonwell on Base \n\nIn order to help Moonwell with bootstrapping on Base, we will publish a full analysis providing the following recommendations:\n\n* Suggested set of assets to be onboarded, along with an analysis of all of the risk-related metrics for each of them (oracles, volatility, slippage, dex liquidity, …)\n* Recommended parameters for each of those assets\n\n\n#### Budget and timeline\n\nTimeline: Moonwell Artemis and Apollo integrations on the Warden Finance platform will be available within 4 weeks after the proposal is accepted.\n\nBudget: $62.5k per quarter. With the first payment paid up front to cover for initial development costs.\n\nPeriod: Mar 2023 to Mar 2024 (1 year)\n\nWe are a team of three (Hugo Boisselle-Morin, David Dallaire & Philippe Labrecque) with deep experience in crypto, tech, and finance. The proposed grant will cover infrastructure cost ($5K per month to run our simulation platform) as well as contributors' time and expertise.\n\nWe will post quarterly updates on what we have delivered to the DAO and post monthly risk assessments on the Forum.\n\n\n#### Review period\n\nWe propose a 3 month review period where the DAO can terminate the engagement if it is not satisfied by our performance. Given our track record and past contributions we think it is unlikely that such action should be taken.\n\n## Voting\n\n* Yes - I approve the above proposal\n* No - I refuse the above proposal\n",

      "content": "**Summary**\n\nI propose that the Moonwell community vote to authorise the activation of the Moonwell protocol on Base mainnet with the aims of (1) increasing accessibility to Moonwell and (2) connecting the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems to the world of decentralised finance.\n\nBase is an Ethereum Layer 2 incubated by Coinbase. Activating Moonwell on Base will broaden the Moonwell community to include users of the world’s second-largest centralised exchange, helping Moonwell expand cross-chain interoperability on a value-aligned chain.\n\n**About Base**\n\nBase 1 is a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain developed on the Ethereum network, jointly created by Coinbase and Optimism. Since Base operates as an optimistic rollup, it provides substantial enhancements in scalability compared to L1 Ethereum, while maintaining its security from the Ethereum base layer. Following the testnet launch on February 24, 2023, it is expected that Base mainnet will launch in the coming months.\n\nSmart contracts on Base will be deployed and executed on its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) execution layer. Base goes even further than EVM compatibility and achieves EVM equivalence, or full compliance with the Ethereum yellow paper. This means that developers can be confident that any program that runs on Ethereum will be fully compatible with Base.\n\nBuilt on Bedrock, the first iteration of the OP Stack, Base leverages Optimism’s frameworks for scalability and development. The OP Stack is a set of MIT-licensed open-source software that anyone can use or fork, and represents a vision for Ethereum scalability and modularity. With standardisation and compatibility, comes the potential for interoperable L2s including Base to manifest into a larger “Superchain”. Base will also contribute to Optimism’s RetroPGF model, incentivising the development of the open-source public goods that our digital world relies upon.\n\nCoinbase is a proven leader in the digital asset space. After publicising its on-chain ambitions nearly 7 years ago in their “Secret Master Plan,” Base’s release marks the next milestone towards realising their goal of creating a financial system consisting of decentralised applications on an open and globally accessible network with a user base of one billion people.\n\nAdditionally, Coinbase has made significant contributions to Ethereum, particularly in the development of EIP-4844 (sharding), which will dramatically lower fees and gas on Ethereum L2s, with the aim of bringing transaction costs below the “1 cent per transaction” threshold.\n\nCoinbase intends to progressively decentralise Base. In 2023 alone, Coinbase will work towards progressing Base and Optimism mainnet from a Stage 0 rollup to a Stage 1 rollup, with a significant level of decentralisation and trustlessness.\n\n**Motivation**\n\nActivating Moonwell on Base mainnet offers a number of benefits to the Moonwell community, including opportunities to:\n\n- Expand cross-chain interoperability\n- Unlock a massive target audience, Coinbase users\n- Build on shared values\n\n*Expand cross-chain interoperability*\n\nThe launch of Base offers an opportunity to connect the entire DotSama ecosystem with Ethereum in a way that wasn’t possible before. The Moonwell protocol now has the capability of going cross-chain and bringing the best assets from the ecosystem to millions of Coinbase users, including GLMR and DOT.\n\nSince the Moonwell community first activated Apollo just over a year ago, we have pursued the goal of connecting the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems to the world of decentralised finance. The Moonwell community also shares the Moonbeam vision of connected smart contracts with EVM as the base layer.\n\nThis vision is supported by the cross-chain integrations and features available on Moonbeam, which will allow Moonwell to integrate and expand to Base, reaching even more people.\n\n*Unlock a massive target audience, Coinbase users*\n\nBase represents a massive target audience for Moonwell — Coinbase’s 110m verified users (over 8.5m of which remain active during the recent bear market). Coinbase’s retail mobile app now includes a “web3” tab that enables Coinbase users to seamlessly interact with dapps and move assets across the ecosystem. If Moonwell reaches only 10% of active Coinbase users, we can potentially add 850,000 new users to our community, which is equivalent to 2x DeFi’s current unique users per month.\n\nActivating Moonwell on Base means exposing up to 110m users to the world of decentralised finance and familiarising them with our existing activations on Moonbeam and Moonriver.\n\nAs one of the first projects to activate on the Base testnet, Moonwell will enjoy early mover benefits (specifically in attracting sufficient liquidity) and join a community of web3 giants like Aave, Sushiswap, and Chainlink on Base mainnet.\n\n*Build on shared values*\n\nThe activation of Moonwell on Base signifies not only considerable expansion possibilities for the community but also the security and trust-centric values of Coinbase, which closely resonate with the fundamental principles of the Moonwell community.\n\nThese values attracted now-Moonwell contributors Luke Youngblood and Octavius, each of whom joined Coinbase in 2018-2019. During his 3-year career at Coinbase, Luke helped build Staking Rewards, another example of Coinbase beginning to build directly on L1 protocols. Octavius helped build the cold storage systems that enable Coinbase to protect billions of dollars in crypto.\n\nThe Moonwell protocol on Base will be governed by WELL token holders. It is expected that Halborn Security will complete audits of all new functionality enabled. Additionally, Moonwell markets are protected from price manipulation and secured by Chainlink oracle price feeds. Risk management platform Gauntlet Network runs frequent economic simulations to ensure that asset risk parameters are set to safe values.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nImplementation of MIP-39 will include the following:\n- Halborn Security will provide audits of new functionality in the Moonwell protocol, including new cross-chain capabilities.\n- When sufficient liquidity and Chainlink price feeds are available, the Moonwell community will have the opportunity to vote for activation of the Moonwell protocol on Base mainnet.\n\n**Voting**\n\nAll Moonwell community members are encouraged to vote on this proposal. Voting options include:\n\n- Yes: Activate the Moonwell protocol on Base mainnet\n- No: Make no change\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBuilding on Base will be instrumental to expanding and growing the Moonwell community. I am massively excited about the possibility of the Moonwell community increasing accessibility to Moonwell and connecting the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems to the world of decentralised finance via entering the Base ecosystem, especially so early in its development.\n\nTo summarise, activating Moonwell on Base presents an excellent opportunity to expand cross-chain interoperability. Base will offer Moonwell access to a massive target audience with similar values to our community.\n\nThe arrival of Base has created an opportunity for the Moonwell community to connect Moonbeam and the greater Polkadot ecosystem with Ethereum in a way that wasn’t previously possible before. Let’s bring the power of DeFi to the next billion users!",

      "content": "## Apollo Summary\n\nWe recommend the following parameter changes:\n- **Decrease FRAX borrow cap from 5,682,000 to 3,000,000**\n- **Set BTC.multi borrow cap to 4**\n\n\n### Rationale:\nThe VaR is $0 and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. The LaR is $144k and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. WMOVR has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $68k. xcKSM has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $77k. FRAX, USDC.multi, ETH.multi, and USDT.multi each have a VaR and LaR of $0.\n\nETH.multi, FRAX, USDC.multi, USDT.multi, WMOVR, and xcKSM's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\n\nGauntlet analyzes assets’ on-chain liquidity and potential risk of short market manipulation attack to assess borrow cap recommendations.\n\nBTC.multi circulating [supply](https://moonriver.moonscan.io/token/0x6ab6d61428fde76768d7b45d8bfeec19c6ef91a8) on Moonriver chain totals 8.2 BTC. Since BTC.multi is still a borrowable asset and available to bridge to Moonriver, we recommend adding a borrow cap of 4 BTC.\n\nGauntlet recommends decreasing the borrow caps for FRAX because of recent decreases in liquidity on the Moonriver chain and borrow cap utilization being below 20%.\n\n### FRAX Borrow Tokens since Jan 1st\n![](https://i.imgur.com/HR3cS0d.png)\n\n\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation.

      "content": "## Apollo Summary\nWe recommend the following parameter changes:\n- **Decrease ETH.multi borrow cap from 7,000 to 1,500**\n- **Decrease xcKSM borrow cap from 70,000 to 32,000**\n\n\nRationale:\nThe VaR is $0 and our CF recommendations will leave it unchanged. The LaR is $202k and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. WMOVR has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $120k. xcKSM has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $79k. ETH.multi, FRAX, USDC.multi, and USDT.multi each have a VaR and LaR of $0.\n\n\nETH.multi, FRAX, USDC.multi, USDT.multi, WMOVR, and xcKSM's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\n\nGauntlet analyzes assets’ on-chain liquidity and potential risk of short market manipulation attack to assess borrow cap recommendations. Gauntlet recommends decreasing the borrow caps for ETH.multi and xcKSM because of recent decreases in liquidity on the Moonriver chain and borrow cap utilization being below 20% since mid February.\n### xcKSM Borrow Tokens since Jan 1st\n![](https://i.imgur.com/6HjwfYM.png)\n### ETH.multi Borrow Tokens since Jan 1st\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2UJHWXd.png)\n\n\n\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. To learn more about our methodologies, please see the Helpful Links section at the bottom.\n\n## Supporting Data\n\nThe below figures show trends on key market statistics regarding borrows and utilization that we will continue to monitor:\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Aggregate Positions & Borrow Usages\n![](https://i.imgur.com/nAMPFBQ.png)\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Supply\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rPrlFdW.png)\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Borrows\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QyENDMH.png)\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8vLuwyL.png)\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/685Frrq.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\nThe community should use Gauntlet’s [Gauntlet’s Apollo Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/apollo) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Apollo.\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/dCfV7Je.png)\n#\n\n\n\n## Quick Links\n\n*Please click below to learn about our methodologies:*\n\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

The LaR will increase from $303k to $307k. WGLMR has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $290k. xcDOT has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $13k. BUSD.wh, USDC.wh, WBTC.wh, WETH.wh, FRAX, and xcUSDT each have a VaR and LaR of $0.\n\nUSDC.wh, WBTC.wh, WETH.wh, WGLMR, and xcUSDT are relatively safe from a market risk perspective, so can have their collateral factors gradually increased to improve capital efficiency. FRAX and xcDOT's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\nBorrow Amounts for WETH.wh, WBTC.wh, and xcUSDT have approached near full utilization of ther respective borrow caps. Gauntlet analyzed the assets’ liquidity on-chain and potential risk of short market manipulation attack to assess the risk of increasing borrow caps on the protocol. Gauntlet recommends increasing the borrow cap for these assets in order to optimize user experience and growth while mitigating tail risks to the protocol. Here is a table with potential impact to reserves with the recommended borrow cap increases:\n\n| Asset   | Borrow Cap | Recommended Borrow Cap | Potential Increase of Annualized Reserve ($) |\n| ------- | ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |\n| WBTC.wh | 60         | 110                    | $8,349                                 |\n| WETH.wh | 800        | 1,110                   | $7,775                               |\n| xcUSDT  | 250,000    | 500,000                | $1,803                                 |\n\n\n\n**BUSD Deprecation**\nAs shared in the **[MIP 29/30] Risk Parameter Updates (2023-02-20)** [post](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/mip-29-30-risk-parameter-updates-2023-02-20/385), Gauntlet is continuing to disable collateral enablement for BUSD by lowering the Collateral Factor from 15% to 10%.\n\n| CF Reduction                             | .15→.1   |\n| ---------------------------------------- | -------- |\n| Estimated Liquidation ($) Impact                   | 0        |\n| Estimated Liquidation Accounts Total Supply Impact | 0        |\n| Estimated Active Collateral Usage ($)    | $14k     |\n| Estimated Loss Annualized Reserve Impact | \\-$75.60 |\n\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. To learn more about our methodologies, please see the Helpful Links section at the bottom.\n\n## Supporting Data\n\nThe below figures show trends on key market statistics regarding borrows and utilization that we will continue to monitor:\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Aggregate Positions & Borrow Usages\n![](https://i.imgur.com/z0uUki5.png)\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Supply\n![](https://i.imgur.com/albVzHq.png)\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Borrows\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zKlY09p.png)\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/REwZTFn.png)\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FCGt4Jq.png)\n\n\n### BUSD Collateral Usage ($) since Feb 15th\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5Z0DKqH.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\nThe community should use [Gauntlet’s Artemis Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/artemis) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Artemis.\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NICB0T0.png)\n\n\n\n\n## Quick Links\n\n*Please click below to learn about our methodologies:*\n\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

Dashboards to monitor general and asset-specific risk indicators\n2. API access and CSV download for all metrics\n3. Documentation of Moonwell’s risk indicators and general dynamics\n\nThe dashboard will be hosted in a new risk management area within IntoTheBlock’s platform. Data for each indicator is published and updated daily for Moonwell Artemis’s users to track the protocol’s economic risk landscape. The ITB team will add support for more assets and update indicators plus its status reports every quarter.\n\n### Overview\n\nOver the past two years IntoTheBlock has been heavily involved in DeFi. This started with the launch of DeFi Insights analytics and has grown significantly through our Institutional Quantitative Strategies (ITB Quant) service. ITB’s DeFi Quant platform acts as a gateway used by 20+ of the largest crypto institutions to access its DeFi yields via sophisticated quantitative strategies with appropriate risk management models. Moonwell’s strategy is one of the latest additions to the ITB DeFi Quant platform, with ITB clients depositing several millions into the protocol.\n\nTo streamline institutional adoption of DeFi, IntoTheBlock decided to make risk metrics and models accessible via APIs and analytics dashboards. The purpose of this proposal is to make these risk models available to Moonwell’s institutional and individual investors.\n\n### Motivation\n\nMonitoring and managing risk is paramount to any financial service. Recent events in the DeFi market prove that risk management is essential to accelerating the growth of the space. At ITB we believe that risk management in DeFi should be done out in the open, following crypto’s ethos, and not be a luxury expense.\n\nFollowing ITB’s experience safeguarding hundreds of millions into DeFi through advanced risk management models, we believe that expanding these tools and offering them to Moonwell would help make DeFi safer over the mid-to long-term. Enabling Moonwell’s community to monitor real-time economic risks should be a key factor in boosting institutional and retail investor confidence.\n\n### Implementation\n\nIntoTheBlock proposes to split the grant in two phases. Phase I will include the following:\n\n- Dashboard with 50% of ITB’s proposed risk indicators (highlighted in green in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10dSS0J2RljklFHfHnHEMCRIwqSEAKjnDJAJZyRwiLlU/edit?usp=sharing))\n- API access and csv downloads for these metrics\n- Corresponding documentation\n\nPhase II will consist of shipping the remaining 50% of indicators, along with their API access, csv downloads and documentation.\n\nThe following [demo link](https://defirisk.intotheblock.com/metrics/avalanche/benqi) for ITB's Benqi dashboard showcases what the product experience will look like.\n\nThese indicators are open to modification after receiving feedback from the Moonwell community and other Moonwell contributors. IntoTheBlock is dedicated to maintain and expand the capabilities of the Moonwell risk monitoring solution that address changes to the protocol or market conditions. \n\n### Grant Milestones & Payments\n\nFor Phase I, IntoTheBlock is requesting a total of $30k upon start of the following:\n\n1. Moonwell risk dashboard with 50% of indicators\n2. Documentation on indicators\n3. API access\n4. CSV data download functionality\n\nWe are targeting a launch 60 days after the proposal passes for Phase I.\n\nThe exchange rate of WELL/USD will be the 30-day time-weighted average price (TWAP) prior to the date the proposal is submitted for the on-chain vote. The price source will be the close price of WELL published by CoinMarketCap. Calculations for the 30-Day TWAP can be seen through the [following spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTK_U5FIHIPtbARTq6iLTP4XDHnLmX9NMecNW6Z6qA8/edit?usp=sharing). \n\nThe release of these milestones will also be accompanied with a marketing push from the IntoTheBlock team to increase the visibility of these tools. The ITB team will then review Moonwell’s community feedback and take it into consideration prior to submitting a separate proposal for Phase II for an additional $30k, bringing the total amount to $60k.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIntoTheBlock’s proposal looks to enable real time economic risk monitoring for the Moonwell protocol. The risk indicators included in this proposal are based on IntoTheBlock’s experience managing and monitoring risks for institutional clients depositing into Moonwell and similar protocols. This release is part of a broader effort to democratize access to risk management tools for all DeFi users, including those of the Moonwell protocol.",

      "content": "## Artemis Summary\n\nWe recommend the following parameter changes:\n- **Increase USDC.wh collateral factor from 40.0% to 50.0%.**\n- **Increase WBTC.wh collateral factor from 25.0% to 30.0%.**\n- **Increase WETH.wh collateral factor from 35.0% to 45.0%.**\n- **Increase xcDOT collateral factor from 62.0% to 64.0%.**\n- **Increase WETH.wh borrow cap from 400 to 800**\n- **Increase WBTC.wh borrow cap from 30 to 60**\n- **Increase USDC.wh borrow cap from 516,000 to 1,000,000**\n\nRationale:\n\nThe VaR is $358k and our recommendations will increase it by $2k to $360k. The LaR is $58k and our recommendations will increase it by $3k to $61k.  FRAX has a VaR of $360k and a LaR of $47k. USDC.wh has a VaR of $169 and a LaR of $11.9k. WETH.wh has a VaR of $326 and a LaR of $0. xcDOT has a VaR of $3.76k and a LaR of $46k.\nUSDC.wh, WBTC.wh, WETH.wh, and xcDOT are relatively safe from a market risk perspective, so can have their collateral factors gradually increased to improve capital efficiency. BUSD.wh, FRAX, and WGLMR's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\nBorrow Amounts for USDC.wh, WETH.wh, and WBTC.wh have approached near full utilization of ther respective borrow caps. Gauntlet analyzed the assets' liquidity on-chain and potential risk of short market manipulation attack to assess the risk of increasing borrow caps on the protocol. Gauntlet recommends increasing the borrow cap for these assets in order to optimize user experience and growth while mitigating tail risks to the protocol.\n\n## BUSD Increased Risk\nGauntlet is reaching out to the Artemis community to address the recent news related to the regulatory actions against BUSD and Paxos. As of recent news reports, Paxos plans to [sunset](https://paxos.com/2023/02/13/paxos-will-halt-minting-new-busd-tokens/) BUSD but they plan to maintain it fully backed and redeemable until February 2024.  Binance plans to support BUSD until they are able to find an [alternative](https://forkast.news/headlines/binance-ceo-non-usd-stablecoins-emerge/) stablecoin.\n\nHowever, Paxos has announced that they will cease minting the token as of February 21, 2023, which will lead to a decline in the circulating token supply of BUSD over time. Here are some of the following risk concerns we have for Artemis:\n\n- The liquidity of BUSD in Moonbeam has been gradually declining. On Stellaswap, the BUSD market's liquidity has decreased by 30% from $1.2M to $827k since the regulatory announcement against BUSD. Despite this, there is still a sufficient amount of liquidity in StellaSwap to support Artemis positions that are utilizing $158k BUSD as collateral and $276k BUSD in outstanding borrows. However, if the decline in BUSD liquidity on Stellaswap continues, it could result in higher slippage and increase the likelihood of insolvencies.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/irAzZGI.png)\n\n- As it currently stands, 99.73% of the BUSD on Moonbeam is concentrated between StellaSwap and Artemis. However, if the liquidity of BUSD on StellaSwap continues to decrease, Artemis will surpass StellaSwap as the largest holder of BUSD on the network in relation to the circulating supply and could potentially lead to overweight exposure to the asset.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/u4nAVpK.png)\n\n- Furthermore, there have been multiple [publications](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/13/circle-sounded-alarm-on-paxos-told-nydfs-binances-stablecoin-wasnt-fully-backed-bloomberg/) questioning whether there are sufficient reserves to support BUSD,  this could potentially lead to market uncertainty about BUSD’s reserves and cause the asset to depeg from the US dollar across all markets.\n\n### BUSD Potential Next Steps\nGiven the increased risk, Gauntlet is recommending a deprecation plan should the communituy decide to deprecate the Artemis BUSD market.  This plan entails reducing exposure to BUSD by using the listed risk parameters.\n\n- Freeze the BUSD market. Pause both borrow and supply.\n    - This will prevent users from opening any further positions in the liquidity pool.\n- Adjust the IR curves to disincentivize further supply and borrow of BUSD\n    - Increase reserve factor to 99% for BUSD (suppliers will stop receiving interest)\n        - This will increase BUSD reserves from $6 to ~$37 per day and incentivize suppliers to remove their BUSD positions since they are not receiving any further Supply APY.\n- Incrementally reduce collateral factors every 2 weeks, shown in the following table:\n\n| Rec Cadence | Initial  | 2 weeks | 4 weeks | 6 weeks |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CF Reduction | .2 → .15 | .15→.1 | .1→.05 | .05→0 |\n| Liquidation ($) Impact | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 |\n| Liquidation Accounts Total Supply Impact | 0 | 0 | $37,630.95 | $467,561.28 |\n| Estimated Active Collateral Usage ($) | $118.5k | $78.6k | $39k | $0k |\n| Estimated Loss Annualized Reserve Impact | -$612.64 | -$618.84 | -$614.19 | -$605 |\n\nGauntlet will continue to monitor BUSD news and liquidity positions to ensure an efficient deprecation. As BUSD CF is reduced, we will update our deprecation plan as needed. Depending on developing BUSD market behavior and  regulatory risk, certain adjustments may need to be expedited.\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. To learn more about our methodologies, please see the Helpful Links section at the bottom.\n\n## Supporting Data\n\nThe below figures show trends on key market statistics regarding borrows and utilization that we will continue to monitor:\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Aggregate Positions & Borrow Usages\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Io3Dmh9.png)\n\nThis large BTC whale account 0xb4B7c91a46C7d4BFFe99D2ce4b056a5B280ed8e3 opened a borrowable position Feb 15th.\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Supply\n![](https://i.imgur.com/d0NIxHS.png)\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Borrows\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bgTG9ce.png)\n\n\n### Utilization Rate Over Time\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b8RKrR0.png)\n\n\n### Borrow Cap Utilization\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NKzyhH8.png)\n\n\n\n### Individual Account Analysis\nGauntlet wants to notify the community about account  0xb4B7c91a46C7d4BFFe99D2ce4b056a5B280ed8e3 opening an borrow position on Moonwell.

      "title": "MIP 28 Artemis Risk Parameter Recs (2023-02-16)",
      "content": "## Artemis Summary\n\nWe recommend the following parameter changes:\n- **Increase USDC.wh collateral factor from 40.0% to 50.0%.**\n- **Increase WBTC.wh collateral factor from 25.0% to 30.0%.**\n- **Increase WETH.wh collateral factor from 35.0% to 45.0%.**\n- **Increase xcDOT collateral factor from 62.0% to 64.0%.**\n- **Increase WETH.wh borrow cap from 400 to 800**\n- **Increase WBTC.wh borrow cap from 30 to 60**\n- **Increase USDC.wh borrow cap from 516,000 to 1,000,000**\n\nRationale:\n\nThe VaR is $358k and our recommendations will increase it by $2k to $360k. The LaR is $58k and our recommendations will increase it by $3k to $61k.  FRAX has a VaR of $360k and a LaR of $47k. USDC.wh has a VaR of $169 and a LaR of $11.9k. WETH.wh has a VaR of $326 and a LaR of $0. xcDOT has a VaR of $3.76k and a LaR of $46k.\nUSDC.wh, WBTC.wh, WETH.wh, and xcDOT are relatively safe from a market risk perspective, so can have their collateral factors gradually increased to improve capital efficiency. BUSD.wh, FRAX, and WGLMR's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\nBorrow Amounts for USDC.wh, WETH.wh, and WBTC.wh have approached near full utilization of ther respective borrow caps. Gauntlet analyzed the assets' liquidity on-chain and potential risk of short market manipulation attack to assess the risk of increasing borrow caps on the protocol. Gauntlet recommends increasing the borrow cap for these assets in order to optimize user experience and growth while mitigating tail risks to the protocol.\n\n## BUSD Increased Risk\nGauntlet is reaching out to the Artemis community to address the recent news related to the regulatory actions against BUSD and Paxos. As of recent news reports, Paxos plans to [sunset](https://paxos.com/2023/02/13/paxos-will-halt-minting-new-busd-tokens/) BUSD but they plan to maintain it fully backed and redeemable until February 2024.  Binance plans to support BUSD until they are able to find an [alternative](https://forkast.news/headlines/binance-ceo-non-usd-stablecoins-emerge/) stablecoin.\n\nHowever, Paxos has announced that they will cease minting the token as of February 21, 2023, which will lead to a decline in the circulating token supply of BUSD over time. Here are some of the following risk concerns we have for Artemis:\n\n- The liquidity of BUSD in Moonbeam has been gradually declining. On Stellaswap, the BUSD market's liquidity has decreased by 30% from $1.2M to $827k since the regulatory announcement against BUSD. Despite this, there is still a sufficient amount of liquidity in StellaSwap to support Artemis positions that are utilizing $158k BUSD as collateral and $276k BUSD in outstanding borrows. However, if the decline in BUSD liquidity on Stellaswap continues, it could result in higher slippage and increase the likelihood of insolvencies.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/irAzZGI.png)\n\n- As it currently stands, 99.73% of the BUSD on Moonbeam is concentrated between StellaSwap and Artemis. However, if the liquidity of BUSD on StellaSwap continues to decrease, Artemis will surpass StellaSwap as the largest holder of BUSD on the network in relation to the circulating supply and could potentially lead to overweight exposure to the asset.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/u4nAVpK.png)\n\n- Furthermore, there have been multiple [publications](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/13/circle-sounded-alarm-on-paxos-told-nydfs-binances-stablecoin-wasnt-fully-backed-bloomberg/) questioning whether there are sufficient reserves to support BUSD,  this could potentially lead to market uncertainty about BUSD’s reserves and cause the asset to depeg from the US dollar across all markets.\n\n### BUSD Potential Next Steps\nGiven the increased risk, Gauntlet is recommending a deprecation plan should the communituy decide to deprecate the Artemis BUSD market.  This plan entails reducing exposure to BUSD by using the listed risk parameters.\n\n- Freeze the BUSD market. Pause both borrow and supply.\n    - This will prevent users from opening any further positions in the liquidity pool.\n- Adjust the IR curves to disincentivize further supply and borrow of BUSD\n    - Increase reserve factor to 99% for BUSD (suppliers will stop receiving interest)\n        - This will increase BUSD reserves from $6 to ~$37 per day and incentivize suppliers to remove their BUSD positions since they are not receiving any further Supply APY.\n- Incrementally reduce collateral factors every 2 weeks, shown in the following table:\n\n| Rec Cadence | Initial  | 2 weeks | 4 weeks | 6 weeks |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CF Reduction | .2 → .15 | .15→.1 | .1→.05 | .05→0 |\n| Liquidation ($) Impact | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 |\n| Liquidation Accounts Total Supply Impact | 0 | 0 | $37,630.95 | $467,561.28 |\n| Estimated Active Collateral Usage ($) | $118.5k | $78.6k | $39k | $0k |\n| Estimated Loss Annualized Reserve Impact | -$612.64 | -$618.84 | -$614.19 | -$605 |\n\nGauntlet will continue to monitor BUSD news and liquidity positions to ensure an efficient deprecation. As BUSD CF is reduced, we will update our deprecation plan as needed. Depending on developing BUSD market behavior and  regulatory risk, certain adjustments may need to be expedited.\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. To learn more about our methodologies, please see the Helpful Links section at the bottom.\n\n## Supporting Data\n\nThe below figures show trends on key market statistics regarding borrows and utilization that we will continue to monitor:\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Aggregate Positions & Borrow Usages\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Io3Dmh9.png)\n\nThis large BTC whale account 0xb4B7c91a46C7d4BFFe99D2ce4b056a5B280ed8e3 opened a borrowable position Feb 15th.\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Supply\n![](https://i.imgur.com/d0NIxHS.png)\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Borrows\n![](https://i.imgur.com/bgTG9ce.png)\n\n\n### Utilization Rate Over Time\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b8RKrR0.png)\n\n\n### Borrow Cap Utilization\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NKzyhH8.png)\n\n\n\n### Individual Account Analysis\nGauntlet wants to notify the community about account  0xb4B7c91a46C7d4BFFe99D2ce4b056a5B280ed8e3 opening an borrow position on Moonwell. This account has a large position representing 99% of WBTC.wh supply on Artemis.

2023 20:34:07 GMT\n- **Network**: Moonbeam\n- **Block Height**: 2,970,608\n\nThe submitter (`not-taco`), as part of this proposal, will get `100,000 WELL` sent to their wallet at `0x7e4a3edd2F6C516166b4C615884b69B7dbfF3fE5`.\n\nThis proposal will also turn down the rewards on the `BUSD.wh` market given the recent announcement from Paxos.\n\n# Safety Module\nAt the time this proposal was generated there was `153,019,928` **WELL** staked in the **Safety Module**, with a valuation of `$685,120.78` (based on a **WELL** price of `$0.004477` pulled from **StellaSwap**).\n\nThis proposal, if executed, would adjust the rewards on the **Safety Module** to <span style=\"color:#FFCF60\">keep emissions the same</span> and emits `6,057,692` **WELL** over the next **28 days**:\n\n- Current (estimated APR = `~51.64%`): \n    - `2.5040` WELL / **second**\n    - `216,346.15` WELL / **day**\n    - `6,057,692.31` WELL / **reward cycle (28

Liquidity Pool Rewarder\nAt the time this proposal was generated there were `44,793,972` **WELL** and `414,033` **GLMR** provided by liquidity providers in the **StellaSwap** **WELL**/**GLMR** pool totaling `$401,114.83`.\n\nThis proposal, if executed, would adjust the rewards on the **Dex Rewarder** to <span style=\"color:red\">decrease</span> emissions <span style=\"color:red\">-10.7143%</span> and emits `3,605,769` **WELL** over the next **28 days**:\n\nCurrent rewards will expire at **Fri, 24 Feb 2023 03:30:00 GMT**\n\n- Current (estimated APR = `~58.80%`) days: \n    - `1.6693` WELL / **second**\n    - `144,230.77` WELL / **day**\n    - `4,038,461.54` WELL / **reward cycle (28 days)**\n<br><br>\n- Proposed (estimated APR = `~52.50%`): \n

      "title": "MIP 24 Apollo Reserve Factor Recs, Risk Parameter Recs (2023-02-07)",
      "content": "## Apollo Summary\nWe recommend the following parameter changes:\n\n- **Increase USDC.multi collateral factor from 64.0% to 66.0%.**\n- **Increase USDT.multi collateral factor from 42.0% to 44.0%.**\n\nThe VaR is $0 and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. The LaR is $477k and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. FRAX has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $23k. USDC.multi has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $448k. USDT.multi has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $83. WMOVR has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $5k. ETH.multi and xcKSM both have a VaR and LaR of $0.\n\nUSDC.multi and USDT.multi are relatively safe from a market risk perspective, so can have their collateral factors gradually increased to improve capital efficiency. ETH.multi, FRAX, WMOVR, and xcKSM's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\n### Reserve Factor Recommendations\nOur recommendation for reserve factors would be to standardize them for the purpose of consistency and to align with market rates. We recommend using a reserve factor of 15% for stablecoins and 25% for volatile assets as this matches the reserve factors used by similar protocols and would result in minimal change across the different protocol assets. We do not expect the Reserve Factor to require changes frequently, though if reserve levels change, we will consider adjusting RFs again. The current proposed changes (as of Jan 24th) are summarized in the table below.\n\n| Protocol | Asset      | Current RF | Proposed RF | Current Reserves | Current Supply |\n| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------------- | -------------- |\n| Apollo   | MOVR       | 20%        | 25%         | $167,247         | $3,060,531     |\n|          | xcKSM      | 25%        | 25%         | $72,672          | $1,918,220     |\n|          | FRAX       | 20%        | 15%         | $226,203         | $8,130,201     |\n|          | USDT.multi | 20%        | 15%         | $95,338          | $2,519,001     |\n|          | USDC.multi | 15%        | 15%         | $282,184         | $16,204,339    |\n|          | ETH.multi  | 25%        | 25%         | $126,813         | $9,779,502     |\n|          | BTC.multi  | 25%        | 25%         | $15,949          | $87,691        |\n\n## Methodology\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. To learn more about our methodologies, please see the Helpful Links section at the bottom.\n\n## Supporting Data\n\nThe below figures show trends on key market statistics regarding borrows and utilization that we will continue to monitor:\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Aggregate Positions & Borrow Usages\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3H67QZ3.png)\n\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Supply\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3Lu3cow.png)\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Borrows\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WyDgoIs.png)\n\n\n\n### Utilization Rate Over Time\n![](https://i.imgur.com/b5D64Yn.png)\n\n### Borrow Cap Utilization\n![](https://i.imgur.com/QRXDmc3.png)\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nThe community should use [Gauntlet’s Apollo Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/apollo) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Apollo.\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2otSq1e.png)\n\n\n## Quick Links\n\n*Please click below to learn about our methodologies:*\n\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. To learn more about our methodologies, please see the Helpful Links section at the bottom.\n\n## Supporting Data\n\nThe below figures show trends on key market statistics regarding borrows and utilization that we will continue to monitor:\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Aggregate Positions & Borrow Usages\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WTRsTYe.png)\n\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Supply\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DIkNBUF.png)\n\n\n### Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Borrows\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iqkh8PI.png)\n\n\n### Utilization Rate Over Time\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3G0iFzE.png)\n\n### Borrow Cap Utilization\n![](https://i.imgur.com/7s2360e.png)\n\n\n### Individual Account Analysis\nWe want to notify the community about account  0xb4B7c91a46C7d4BFFe99D2ce4b056a5B280ed8e3.

      "content": "## Reserve Factor Recommendations\n\nOur recommendation for reserve factors would be to standardize them for the purpose of consistency and to align with market rates. We recommend using a reserve factor of 15% for stablecoins and 25% for volatile assets as this matches the reserve factors used by similar protocols and would result in minimal change across the different protocol assets. We do not expect the Reserve Factor to require changes frequently, though if reserve levels change, we will consider adjusting RFs again. The current proposed changes are summarized in the table below.\n\n| Protocol | Asset | Current RF | Proposed RF | Current Reserves | Current Supply |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Artemis | GLMR | 30% | 25% | $111,434 | $8,072,906 |\n|  | xcDOT | 30% | 25% | $91,858 | $5,314,627 |\n|  | FRAX | 25% | 15% | $113,172 | $8,951,300 |\n|  | USDC.wh | 15% | 15% | $182 | $1,826,299 |\n|  | ETH.wh | 25% | 25% | $291 | $1,444,725 |\n|  | BTC.wh | 25% | 25% | $125 | $6,507,800 |\n\n\n## Artemis Summary Recommendations\n\n- **Increase the USDC.wh collateral factor from 15.0% to 30.0%.**\n- **Increase the WETH.wh collateral factor from 15.0% to 25.0%.**\n- **Increase the WBTC.wh collateral factor from 15.0% to 25.0%.**\n- **Increase USDC.wh borrow cap from 317,000 to 412,000**\n- **Increase WETH.wh borrow cap from 210 to 275**\n- **Increase WBTC.wh borrow cap from 15 to 20**\n\nThe VaR is $0 and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. The LaR is $101k and our recommendations will leave it unchanged. WBTC.wh has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $3k. WETH.wh has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $483. WGLMR has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $97k. FRAX, USDC.wh, and xcDOT each have a VaR and LaR of $0.\n\nUSDC.wh, WBTC.wh, and WETH.wh. are relatively safe from a market risk perspective, so we can have their collateral factors increased to improve capital efficiency. As these are newly listed assets on the protocol, Gauntlet recommends larger increases in CF in order to improve capital efficiency in a timely manner. FRAX, WGLMR, and xcDOT's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet’s [Gauntlet’s Artemis Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/artemis) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Artemis.\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.![](https://i.imgur.com/ZigyG7j.png)\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

      "title": "[MIP-21] Re-balancing of WELL Token Liquidity Incentives (01/20/2022)",
      "content": "**Title:** MIP-21: Re-balancing of WELL Token Liquidity Incentives\n\n**Author(s):** Xavier D’Mello\n\n**Submission Date:** 01/20/2022\n\n# Summary\n\nOver the past few months, multiple Moonwell Improvement Proposals have adjusted reward speeds and re-balanced the allocations of WELL and MFAM liquidity incentives across Moonwell’s sister protocols, Apollo and Artemis. This proposal serves as a continuation, as reward speeds must be adjusted on a 4 week basis.\n\nThe total designated amount of WELL reward tokens, as allocated by the Lunar Technology Foundation, will remain unchanged. This proposal merely calls for a re-balancing of the previously allocated tokens across the three components (Core, Safety Module, and DEX LP), in order to maintain target yield rates despite ever fluctuating TVL.\n\nOne focus of MIP-21 is to maintain a rewarding incentive for staking in the Safety Module. The Safety Module serves a vital function in backstopping the protocol in case of a shortfall event and the proposed distribution changes should incentivise additional liquidity. Based on the fluctuating market price of WELL, I am suggesting to further raise the reward allocation to the Safety Module from 38.5% to 42%, which supports a target reward APR of 60%.\n\nSimilar to the other reward adjustment MIPs, I have also included a one time grant of 100,000 WELL tokens in this proposal to my wallet address. I believe this will set a healthy precedent and encourage other community members to take on the work and responsibility of maintaining Moonwell.\n\n# Proposed Changes\n\n**Core**\n- This proposal adds both GLMR and WELL rewards to the newly added BUSD.wh market.\n\n**Distribution Weighting**\n\n- Safety Module: 38.5% -> 42% (~60% APR)\n- DEX LP: 31.5 -> 28% (~60% APR)\n- Core: Unchanged at 30%\n\n# Definitions\n**WELL** - The Moonwell Artemis governance token\n\n**Liquidity Incentives** - WELL tokens that have been allocated for use as rewards to incentivize liquidity growth.\n\n**Core** - Moonwell Artemis lending protocol (https://moonwell.fi/artemis).\n\n**DEX LP** - StellaSwap’s WELL/GLMR farm (https://app.stellaswap.com/farm).\n\n**Safety Module** - Smart contract that allows users to stake their WELL tokens in order to earn liquidity incentives and help backstop the Moonwell protocol.\n\n**Reward Speed** - The rate at which WELL tokens (on a per second basis) are distributed proportionally to DEX LPs, wallets staking in the Safety Module, and those supplying/borrowing on Moonwell.\n\n# Overview\n\nOn November 29th, 2022, the ratio of WELL rewards between the 3 components were set as follows:![|624x135.4163358778626](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/kvw2_ueh_ShZT9u63YOQUIoVOM-wkFEU3XMf0B1dVMqwwIIFzmjiKMTaJQtNgCNSxK5XoPK2u8n5MfbKxh5nUPt1Cudlffv5MgJeDRHC8DP9q_UbeKmgl2mfXmyvBdwN7JJaxuomYXfG2LcoOoWAbK5blUJMx5BdVhccw6t9TNAXUedNk9MiurUFLyFwng)\n\nAs of January 17th, 2023, a new ratio is recommended. These numbers are based on TVL changes in the Safety Module and a decrease in the price of the WELL token:\n\n![|624x129](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/H1hhOw_6ArIADRDedgiuSzeUlV38AfbG2Urb5TRdUqJiVBS0fQchwo8ATyhNnpja1hb7m8l4__ZknhwTxh8nLSsU-X-7BNBJGDt3Ndts4FnhPzak8taGCmA_Lk81LzjvVfN_OOiNKOwALmabl-FZkHLnrMv7bsXm8iOg7AAHDdfCZVF4dXr7KTwDIWEcBw)\n\n# Core Protocol Rewards\n\nThis proposal adds both GLMR and WELL rewards to the newly added BUSD.wh market. No other changes have been made to core rewards.\n\n# Safety Module\n\nThe first of the three aforementioned components that I will cover is the Safety Module.\n\nThe goal of liquidity incentives in the Safety Module is to compensate Safety Module (WELL) stakers for providing their liquidity to help backstop the Moonwell protocol. The Safety Module rewards are configured as the amount of WELL tokens per second that are distributed proportionally to every wallet that stakes in the Safety Module. This is usually referred to as the reward speed.\n\nAs of November 29th, 2022, the last time the Safety Module reward speed was updated, the WELL rewards were set as follows:\n\n![|624x236.76343953745848](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7nSYu8dEvS_IXHexNeijsTiUTBiwvA0eFTnWSn7vroULcDsZWpREqgWZRoHg4cIK-c99podTfXlkjM-zkat7UJpdbQRtBrYGXEn3lBTNUcm88fSyycwt1QHJ6cqJq-viaL7Tmnpc3dEOCqKzXKqbtJeOFcHDvQf5i__3d7powbOpY2D4QZ3x5DrMFgaPdQ)\n\nAs of January 17th, 2022, the Safety Module had ~127.8M WELL staked in it, valued at $438,608.87. The price of WELL has dropped from $0.00462 to $0.0032 since the last Artemis MIP. It is recommended that the reward speed for the safety module be increased from the current rate of 2.3 WELL per second to a new rate of 2.5 WELL per second in order to maintain a target APR of 60% APR at $450,000 TVL.\n\n![|624x237](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7cfAtff50QsA5ysFgfXiwQArKolcq5WFH299_3EbVzbCwcRbJqI2UTnP9Xja0zTK-MQBjubQUu-0TbPPTjqdSvluDQm50E-CtEcO2pk6FpF6xDbZ3n3_fZqTq75gPGvUmyuCWWTKKCphXZzrr7CR4iGauimt2eaABzpB23buwNJ-mPXg6XQOyUM7bVB5hA)\n\n# DEX LP\n\nThe WELL/GLMR market on StellaSwap provides useful liquidity to either buy or sell the WELL token. Liquidity Providers, commonly referred to as LPs, earn rewards for adding liquidity to the WELL/GLMR market and staking their LP tokens in StellaSwap’s farm. “Reward periods” are defined in the farm that encompass both a “reward speed,” in the form of the number of WELL tokens per second that are distributed proportionally to all stakers in the farm, and an ending timestamp, which defines when the reward period ends.\n\nAs of January 17th, 2023, the TVL in the farm was $301,370. The price of WELL has dropped from $0.00462 to $0.0032 since the last Artemis MIP. In order to maintain healthy liquidity incentives for both Core protocol users and Safety Module stakers after a decrease in the price of WELL, it is recommended that the target APR be reduced to 60%. The new recommended reward speed is 1.67 WELL per second, with an end timestamp of 1677209400, which is equal to Fri Feb 24 2023 03:30:00 GMT+0000.\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThank you for taking the time to read through my recommended updates to the distribution of WELL liquidity incentives. Please feel free to provide feedback and commentary and let me know what changes you agree or disagree with.\n\nTo date, the decentralization of the Moonwell Artemis protocol has been a success. If passed, MIP-21 will join a series of successful governance proposals that have been executed successfully thanks to insight, feedback and voting from the Moonwell community.\n\nAs mentioned in the summary, I have requested a one time grant of 100,000 WELL tokens as payment for the time and effort it took to analyze this data and create the proposal. I would encourage other community members who take on the responsibility of submitting proposals for the betterment of Moonwell to do the same.\n\nAlso, please note that though I am an independent member of the Moonwell community, I have consulted with other contributors to the Moonwell protocol in order to source past reward distribution data and sanity check the recommended changes.",

      "title": "[MIP-20] Re-balancing of MFAM/MOVR Token Liquidity Incentives",
      "content": "**Author(s):** Fechuky\n\n**Submission Date:** 01/20/2023\n\n## Summary\nThe Moonbeam Foundation has provided a grant of 9,926 MOVR to Moonwell Apollo liquidity providers for February in order to fuel the growth of the Moonriver ecosystem. In continuation with my previous proposal MIP-9, I am proposing reward speed adjustments that fully distribute these liquidity incentives to the Core lending protocol, as well as adjustments of MFAM liquidity incentives to the Safety Module, and the Solarbeam MFAM - MOVR farm.\n\nAs a part of this proposal, I have included a 100,000 MFAM grant to my wallet address. This is in line with the precedent set by community member not-taco in his first proposal on Moonwell Artemis (MIP-2), where he encouraged new people to submit proposals and maintain the protocol through governance.\n\n## Proposed Updates\n\n\n**Safety Module:**\n* 2.54 -> 2.86 MFAM per second \n  * Target APR: 80%\n\n**DEX LP:** \n* 5.28 -> 5.52 MFAM per second \n  * Target APR: 90%\n\n**Core:** \n* 285,000 MFAM per day \n  * Target APR: ~0.04-0.77%\n* 354.5 MOVR per day \n  * Target APR: ~0.43-2.59%\n\n**Moonwell Contributor Grant:**\n* 100,000 MFAM -> 0x87E1e08eDAfD16346d8328e2CF260ff8Bdad9e84\n\nUpon execution, these new rates will come into effect and the Moonwell Contributor Grant will be transferred on [01/25 00:45 UTC  +24 hour timelock]\n\n## Definitions\n**MFAM** - The Moonwell Apollo governance token.\n\n**Liquidity Incentives** - MFAM and MOVR tokens used as rewards to incentivize liquidity growth.\n\n**Core** - Moonwell Apollo protocol.\n\n**DEX LP** - Solarbeam MFAM - MOVR farm.\n\n**Safety Module** - Smart contract that backstops the Moonwell Apollo protocol in case of a “shortfall event”. Users are able to stake their MFAM and receive MFAM rewards.\n\n**Reward Speed** - The rate at which MFAM and MOVR are distributed to DEX LPs, ,Safety Module stakers, and Core protocol suppliers/borrowers.\n\n## Overview\n500,000,000 MFAM have been designated as liquidity incentives for Moonwell Apollo and will go to the Core protocol, Safety Module, and DEX LP. These tokens are intended to be allocated over a four-year period, beginning from the launch of the Moonwell Apollo protocol on 02/22/22. The ratio between these 3 components needs to be adjusted regularly to properly balance rewards and incentivize liquidity.\n\nBelow I have provided screenshots showing the previous balance of liquidity incentives between the 3 components and my proposed updates.\n\n## Safety Module\nI will begin by covering the Safety Module. The Safety Module’s main function is to backstop the Moonwell protocol in case of a “shortfall event”, and rewards MFAM stakers for doing so. Safety Module rewards are distributed on a per-second basis and are rewarded evenly amongst staking wallets. This rate at which MFAM is distributed is known as the reward speed.       \n\nOn 11/18/22, there was ~73M MFAM staking in the SM, at a valuation of $109,493.14. Since this time, the price of MFAM has remained relatively stable, at around $0.0016 and the amount staked has increased to ~109M MFAM. It is estimated that Safety Module TVL could grow to around $175,000 by 02/24/23. Therefore, it’s recommended that the reward speed for the SM be raised from 2.54 MFAM/second to 2.86 MFAM/second in order to maintain the target 80% APR at the estimated TVL of $175,000.\n\n<img width=\"582\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-20 at 7 23 50 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/213828676-a52f24ac-864c-4d34-b488-c8157ffe2346.png\">\n\n## DEX LP\nThe MFAM - MOVR farm on Solarbeam DEX provides liquidity that allows users to buy or sell the MFAM token on their exchange. Incentivizing TVL in this farm is important as higher liquidity equals lower slippage for those swapping MFAM tokens. LPs earn rewards for adding liquidity to the pool and staking their LP tokens (tokens received for adding liquidity to the pool). This proposal will update the “reward period” for the farm, which includes both the reward speed (number of MFAM/second that are distributed to stakers) and an ending timestamp (which defines when the reward period will end).\n\nOn 11/18/22, the MFAM - MOVR farm on Solarbeam had a TVL of ~$243,6063 and it was estimated that it would grow to around $250,000 by 1/27/23. The target APR for the farm was 100%. This resulted in a reward speed of 5.28 MFAM/second and an end timestamp of 1674790200, which signifies Fri Jan 27 2023 03:30:00 GMT+0000.\n\n<img width=\"464\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-20 at 7 25 18 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/213828800-1f64cd8c-0b2b-4179-aca9-aed89e8ae7ca.png\">\n\nOn 01/17/23, the TVL in the farm was $290,468.23. The price of MFAM has remained relatively stable at around $0.0016. It is estimated that the TVL in the farm could increase to approximately $300,000 by 02/24/23. Therefore, it is recommended that the reward speed be adjusted to 5.52 MFAM/second, with an end timestamp of 1677196800, (Fri Feb 24 2023 03:30:00 GMT+0000).\n\n<img width=\"553\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-20 at 7 25 25 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/213828817-08d6b0f4-3f49-4521-b41c-81d147b05eaf.png\">\n\n## Core Protocol Rewards - MOVR\nThe Moonbeam Foundation has provided a grant of 9,926 MOVR to Moonwell Apollo liquidity providers for Februrary in order to fuel the growth of the Moonriver ecosystem. Anyone that supplies or borrows on Moonwell Apollo will be able to claim these rewards from the Rewards modal found at the top of the Moonwell Apollo app. Like the Core Protocol MFAM rewards, these MOVR rewards are intended to incentivize LPs for providing useful liquidity to the protocol, and can also be split between each of the money markets/suppliers and borrowers at any arbitrary ratio.\n\nAs of 11/26/22, these were the reward emission ratios set for the Moonwell Apollo protocol:\n\n<img width=\"625\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-20 at 7 25 32 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/213828837-b88d7d5d-9f33-48ff-80dd-649c212ed09f.png\">\n\nThis new proposal adjusts emission weightages to accommodate the relative changes in TVL in each of the markets, and also reduces the total emissions proportionally to match the reduced grant from the Moonbeam Foundation while fully distributing the MOVR rewards:\n\n<img width=\"626\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-20 at 7 25 40 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/213828851-db65fa10-47f0-4b3c-8776-ab63ff4e5687.png\">\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThank you for taking the time to read my recommended updates to MFAM and MOVR liquidity incentive distributions. I hope you have taken the time to read through and understand my proposal. Please feel free to give me any feedback or questions that you may have!\n\nI strongly encourage other community members to take an active role in governance. You can share your suggestions and ideas in the forum, and create proposals for the improvement of the protocol! As I have requested a grant for my labor and time spent in the preparation of this proposal, I urge other members of the community who undertake similar work to do the same so that their contributions are appropriately recognized and rewarded.\n\nFinally, though I am an independent member of the Moonwell community, I have consulted with other Moonwell contributors regarding reward distribution data and generating/verifying proposal call data.",

It's simply returning the fees.\n- **The amounts listed in [this post](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/apollo-usdc-multi-liquidations-impacted-users/345/12?u=jmo) delineate the payouts for each user.** We have already deployed [a smart contract](https://moonriver.moonscan.io/address/0x03232b5ee80369A88620615f8328BeEC1884b731#code) to facilitate these payments.\n- Due to technical risks and complications, users who paid their liquidation penalties in MOVR and xcKSM will be paid in USDC.\n- The delta between Reserve Growth and Planned Payouts is the amount of reserve growth that was not sourced from MIP-14 liquidations of USDC.multi.\n\n## Reserve Data\n\n| Token | Reserves EOD 12/24 UTC | Reserves EOD 12/25 UTC | Reserve Delta | Price ($) (12/25) | Reserve Growth on 12/25 ($USD)  | Planned payouts | Payout currency |\n|-------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------|-----------|------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| MOVR  |              20,023.70 |              21,961.65 |       1937.95 |   $7.17   |                   $13,895.11 |      $13,143.40 | USDC            |\n| ETH   |                  74.58 |                 115.83 |         41.25 |  $1221.36 |                   $50,386.04 |      $46,077.57 | ETH             |\n| USDT  |              93,439.68 |              93,878.17 |        438.49 |     $1    |                      $438.49 |         $323.12 | USDT            |\n| USDC  |             275,802.53 |             462,572.95 |     186770.43 |     $1    |                  $186,770.43 |     $169,679.19 | USDC            |\n| FRAX  |             223,229.13 |             224,006.36 |        777.22 | $0.999356 |                      $776.72 |         $605.48 | FRAX            |\n| xcKSM |               1,911.62 |               1,983.79 |         72.17 |   $25.14  |                    $1,814.30 |       $1,559.68 | USDC            |\n| Total |                        |                        |               |           |                     $254,081 |     $231,388.43 |                 |\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

The LaR is $247k and our recommendations will increase it slightly to $255k. FRAX has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $1k. WETH.wh has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $1k. WGLMR has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $157k. xcDOT has a VaR of $0 and a LaR of $34k. USDC.wh and WBTC.wh both have a VaR and LaR of $0.\n\nUSDC.wh, WBTC.wh, and WETH.wh have relatively low risk from a market risk perspective. Their collateral factors can be gradually increased to improve capital efficiency. Liquidity within the Moonbeam chain has increased since initial listing to support an increase in CFs. FRAX, WGLMR, and xcDOT's collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help explain why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation.

LaR will increase from $737k to $837k with no impact to VaR. Increasing USDC.multi’s collateral should have a minor impact on borrow usage with our model estimating it to increase from 83.01% to 85.08%. \n\n## Methodology\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage.

All assets’ collateral factors are effectively balancing risk and capital efficiency.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nGauntlet’s parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. Our agent-based simulations use a wide array of varied input data that changes on a daily basis (including but not limited to asset volatility, asset correlation, asset collateral usage, DEX / CEX liquidity, trading volume, expected market impact of trades, and liquidator behavior). Gauntlet’s simulations tease out complex relationships between these inputs that cannot be simply expressed as heuristics. As such, the input metrics we show below can help understand why some of the param recs have been made but should not be taken as the only reason for recommendation. The individual collateral pages on the [Gauntlet’s Artemis Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/artemis) cover other key statistics and outputs from our simulations that can help with understanding interesting inputs and results related to our simulations.\n\n\n\n### **Supporting Data on Artemis**\n\nBelow are charts showing a snapshot of the largest positions on the protocol that we will continue to monitor and provide insights on. \n\n**Top 10 Borrowers’ Aggregate Positions & Borrow Usages on 12/15**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YsdDgnC.png)\n\n**Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Supply On 12/15**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SNqKGSe.png)\n\n**Top 10 Borrowers’ Entire Borrows On 12/15**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/e24hzXt.png)\n\n**Utilization Rate Since 2022-12-04**\n![](https://i.imgur.com/87yxjMq.png)\n\n\n## Risk Dashboard\n\nThe community should use Gauntlet’s [Gauntlet’s Artemis Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/artemis) to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Artemis. \n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/GjcHgwa.png)\n\n\n\n## Helpful Quick Links\n\n*Please click below to learn about our methodologies:*\n\n* [Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n* [Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd)",

      "content": "**Author(s):** Fei\n\n**Submission Date:** 12/01/2022\n\n**Forum Post:** https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/318\n\n## Summary\nIn preparation for the potential passage of [MIP-7](https://gov.moonwell.fi/artemis/proposal/7), and with it the addition of new USDC.wh, ETH.wh, and WBTC.wh markets on Moonwell Artemis, it’s important that GLMR and WELL rewards are added in order to incentivize liquidity.\n\nIf passed and executed, **MIP-11** will add GLMR liquidity incentives to new markets on Moonwell Artemis. It will also add WELL incentives to these new markets through the rebalancing of the currently allocated core protocol WELL emissions. The rewards will only be implemented on the supply side, not borrow. This is primarily due to conservative borrow caps being implemented on these new markets.\n\nFollowing the precedent set by community members not-taco and fechuky, I have also included a one time grant of 100,000 WELL tokens to my own wallet as part of this proposal. This is to encourage other community members like myself to take on this type of work to help maintain Moonwell.\n\n## Proposed Changes\nAddition/rebalancing of GLMR incentives to account for new USDC.wh, ETH.wh, and WBTC.wh markets on Moonwell Artemis.\n* Supply side reward emissions (GLMR/day):\n  * GLMR: 4,371 -> 3,795\n  * xcDOT: 4,636 -> 3,795\n  * FRAX: 4,238 -> 3,946\n  * ETH.wh: 0 -> 1,214\n  * WBTC.wh: 0 -> 1,214\n  * USDC.wh: 0 -> 1,214\n\nRebalancing of currently allocated WELL liquidity incentives to account for new markets on Moonwell Artemis.\n* Supply side reward emissions (WELL/day):\n  * GLMR: 50,996 -> 38,633\n  * xcDOT: 52,541 -> 38,633\n  * FRAX: 50,996 -> 40,179\n  * ETH.wh: 0 -> 12,363\n  * WBTC.wh: 0 -> 12,363\n  * USDC.wh: 0 -> 12,363\n\n\n## Definitions\n**WELL** - Moonwell Artemis governance token\n\n**GLMR** - Moonbeam governance token\n\n**Liquidity Incentives** - WELL/GLMR tokens that have been allocated for use as rewards to incentivize liquidity growth.\n\n**Core** - Moonwell Artemis protocol\n\n## GLMR Liquidity Incentives\nThrough the incredible support of the Moonbeam community and the passage of [Moonbeam Referendum #65](https://moonbeam.polkassembly.network/referendum/65) “Moonwell Artemis Grant Proposal”, a total of 4,166,400 GLMR have been granted from the Moonbeam Foundation to be utilized as core protocol liquidity incentives.\n\nAs shown in the screenshot below from the aforementioned grant proposal, the estimated weekly emissions rate was to begin at 316,800 GLMR, before tapering down to 136,000 GLMR for the final 12 weeks. You will also notice that it was originally estimated that new Wormhole markets would be live on Moonwell by the week of 11/2/2022. As is often the case in crypto, the unexpected happened with the collapse of FTX and subsequent contagion/capital flight.\n\n<img width=\"1283\" alt=\"191552827-c97f8ca4-cded-42b6-a20d-c7b588c88330\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/204941439-85e398f6-7bc0-402f-bfa8-da13a2d1c9d8.png\">\n\nTo adapt to these new market conditions and account for the fact that [MIP-7](https://gov.moonwell.fi/artemis/proposal/7) will launch .wh markets on Moonwell with quite conservative risk parameters (i.e. 10% collateral factors and ~$250K borrow caps), I would propose that we “save powder” and set the initial weekly rate of total GLMR emissions to 92,711.76. It seems wise to conserve the GLMR grant and increase reward emissions as the liquidity supplied in these markets increases over time. I believe it also makes sense to withhold on adding incentives for borrowing while there remains low borrow caps on these markets. Otherwise, only the first users to borrow would reap the rewards.\n\nPlease find my proposed GLMR liquidity incentive distribution below:\n\n<img width=\"869\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-11-30 at 10 09 20 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/204941528-287eb512-7a78-4b9d-887a-a77cea81c438.png\">\n\n\n## WELL Liquidity Incentives\n750M WELL tokens, or 15% of the token supply, have been allocated as liquidity incentives to actuate TVL growth in the core protocol, Safety Module, and DEX LP. In the recently passed [MIP-10](https://gov.moonwell.fi/artemis/proposal/6) proposal, the weekly rate of total WELL emissions for the core protocol was set at 1,081,730.77.\n\n<img width=\"524\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-11-21 at 4 24 14 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/204941584-c9b53afb-08ab-4c67-bacc-b72ddf68787f.png\">\n\nThis proposal will rebalance the same weekly WELL emission rate (1,081,730.77 WELL) set by [MIP-10](https://gov.moonwell.fi/artemis/proposal/6) to include the new markets. You can see the percentage distributed to each of the new markets in the screenshot below:\n\n<img width=\"939\" alt=\"Screenshot 2022-11-30 at 2 01 39 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/204941623-2ab0214b-faad-4c0b-901b-72413694da92.png\">\n\n## Conclusion\nWith the launch of Wormhole on Moonbeam, the passage of [Moonbeam Referendum #65](https://moonbeam.polkassembly.network/referendum/65), and now the submission on [MIP-7](https://gov.moonwell.fi/artemis/proposal/7) to add new .wh markets, it’s an exciting time for the Moonwell protocol. It’s important that we not only incentivize liquidity growth in these the new markets, but do so in a rational way that accounts for current market conditions and estimated short term liquidity. As the market recovers and liquidity builds, it’s expected that additional proposals will be submitted to update risk parameters (like Gauntlet’s [MIP-3](https://gov.moonwell.fi/artemis/proposal/3)) and readjust liquidity incentives.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read through, and hopefully vote on, my proposal. It’s important for the health and betterment of the protocol that we as a community stay engaged in the governance process.\n\nFinally, I would like to state that though I am an independent member of the Moonwell community, I have consulted with other Moonwell contributors regarding reward distribution data and generating/verifying proposal call data.\n",

This was over a week ago -- and at this point, I think we've waited enough as the contagion is hitting entities more slowly now.\n\nConcretely, this proposal makes the following changes:\n\nAdd the conservative parameters for the following assets as recommended by Gauntlet for:\n1. ETH.wh -- 10% CF, 10% Liq Incentive, 25% RF, 210 Borrow Cap\n2. BTC.wh -- 10% CF, 10% Liq Incentive, 25% RF, 15 Borrow Cap\n3. USDC.wh -- 10% CF, 10% Liq Incentive, 15% RF, 250,000 Borrow Cap\nAnd initialize all reward speeds to zero for these assets. They can be set with a later proposal as they need to be considered holistically across all the supported assets.\n\nWe are skipping BUSD.wh for now because Chainlink doesn't have a feed for this asset yet, and we are using the WBTC Chainlink feed for BTC.wh\n\nNote: I received very well-tested action callData from the Moonwell team (the proposal was thoroughly unit tested on a Moonbeam testnet).

      "title": "**Title:** Re-balancing of WELL Token Liquidity Incentives",
      "content": "**Author(s):** Xavier D’Mello\n\n**Submission Date:** 11/25/2022\n# Summary\n\nOver the past few months, MIP-2, MIP-5, MIP-6, and MIP-9 have adjusted reward speeds and re-balanced the allocations of WELL liquidity incentives across Moonwell’s sister protocols, Apollo and Artemis. This proposal serves as a continuation on Artemis, as reward speeds must be adjusted on a 4 week basis.\n\nThe total designated amount of WELL reward tokens, as allocated by the Lunar Technology Foundation, will remain unchanged. This proposal merely calls for a re-balancing of the previously allocated tokens across the three components (Core, Safety Module, and DEX LP), in order to maintain target yield rates despite ever fluctuating TVL.\n\nOne focus of MIP-10 is to maintain a rewarding incentive for staking in the Safety Module. The Safety Module serves a vital function in backstopping the protocol in case of a shortfall event and the proposed distribution changes should incentivise additional liquidity. Based on the fluctuating market price of WELL, I am suggesting to further raise the reward allocation to the Safety Module from 35% to 38.5%, which supports a target reward APR of 70.45%.\n\nSimilar to the other reward adjustment MIPs, I have also included a one time grant of 100,000 WELL tokens in this proposal to my wallet address. I believe this will set a healthy precedent and encourage other community members to take on the work and responsibility of maintaining Moonwell.\n\n# Proposed Changes\n\n**Distribution Weighting**\n-  Safety Module: 35% -> 38.5%\n- DEX LP: 35% -> 31.5%\n- Core: Unchanged at 30%\n\n# Definitions\n**WELL** - The Moonwell Artemis governance token\n\n**Liquidity Incentives** - WELL tokens that have been allocated for use as rewards to incentivize liquidity growth.\n\n**Core** - Moonwell Artemis lending protocol (https://moonwell.fi/artemis).\n\n**DEX LP** - StellaSwap’s WELL/GLMR farm (https://app.stellaswap.com/farm).\n\n**Safety Module** - Smart contract that allows users to stake their WELL tokens in order to earn liquidity incentives and help backstop the Moonwell protocol.\n\n**Reward Speed** - The rate at which WELL tokens (on a per second basis) are distributed proportionally to DEX LPs, wallets staking in the Safety Module, and those supplying/borrowing on Moonwell.\n\n# Overview\n\nOn November 2nd, 2022, the ratio of WELL rewards between the 3 components was set as follows:\n\n![|630.046783625731x137](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/M8KWT9tBDP4ee0Wemb9eHkCeZwUSEirF-cjcDPPNMksucTSQU0xFeBnOCLyEMrkkp4B-dOzG3xOqmRXz6n8eX2AaeWvwl2HCTJNsTuT2kGl4DdWJrJ1YmqZZPymKYi1WhGREfL1DLv-1pqUvwq5QBVWSgQDt02z_cbSPwv-F0nzsUyEjvzTHq4L1fSFNGA)\n\nAs of November 21st, 2022, a new ratio is recommended. These numbers are based on TVL changes in the DEX LP (StellaSwap farm) and Safety Module:\n\n![|624x135.4163358778626](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pRmbajjBpaqgv5GyyLStGNuPTUQUYsGMrSp7PSQBFKP0GL0PNHYjbr_2PlpCYUzrXRsZZ5OTFVIL931u-cplsjjLyHSY6mTvG_MhPNuYYL1u08ecjfrzcMmv1ET5Mdd2Hx2xDyIFtUKkWHwGiQiZUfif6yERnuQWwXrG9Tcook_q-Rjz_xdLpW4S0_8tOA)\n\n# Safety Module\n\nThe first of the three aforementioned components that I will cover is the **Safety Module.**\n\nThe goal of liquidity incentives in the Safety Module is to compensate Safety Module (WELL) stakers for providing their liquidity to help backstop the Moonwell protocol. The Safety Module rewards are configured as the amount of WELL tokens per second that are distributed proportionally to every wallet that stakes in the Safety Module. This is usually referred to as the **reward speed**.\n\nAs of November 2nd, 2022, the last time the Safety Module reward speed was updated, there was ~77.7M WELL staked in the Safety Module, which was valued at $452,410. An estimate was made that the TVL in the Safety Module might grow to approximately $525,000 by December 1st (4 weeks). The target APR for the Safety Module was 80%. Therefore, the reward speed was set to 2.09 WELL per second.\n\nAs of November 18th, 2022, the Safety Module had ~93M WELL staked in it, valued at $429,469.60. The price of WELL has dropped from $0.00644 to $0.00462. It is estimated that the TVL in the Safety Module might grow to approximately $475,000 by January 27th. It is recommended that the reward speed for the safety module be increased from the current rate of 2.09 WELL per second to a new rate of 2.3 WELL per second in order to maintain a 70.45% APR at $475,000 TVL.\n\n![|624x236.76343953745848](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/5IP-rm1ASQQ-qfEuldwcW4XKcKD9vQVuWCLSwqX7ayNoGhbr41_pt1KE7PMlfa03TZjMv0ZkH3hPfUiN1qZ13T6XEK0NjWnvjXfaOfO-4eTRYZbU-AFyZuO4V4tK1F095LVWULcYHCETgcqeW_-f1rhzjo1CMD56ay5XVqU5JvEw86TdvZayUrJKTiwfiw)\n\n# DEX LP\n\nThe WELL/GLMR market on StellaSwap provides useful liquidity to either buy or sell the WELL token. Liquidity Providers, commonly referred to as LPs, earn rewards for adding liquidity to the WELL/GLMR market and staking their LP tokens in StellaSwap’s farm. “Reward periods” are defined in the farm that encompass both a “reward speed,” in the form of the number of WELL tokens per second that are distributed proportionally to all stakers in the farm, and an ending timestamp, which defines when the reward period ends.\n\nAs of October 27th, 2022, the TVL in the farm was ~$452,410 and it was estimated TVL growth over the next 4 weeks would result in a TVL of approximately $525,000 on December 1st, 2022. The target APR for the farm was 90%. This resulted in a reward speed of 2.09 WELL per second. An end timestamp of 1669951800 was set, which is equal to Fri Dec 02 2022 03:30:00 GMT+0000.\n\n![|624.1613285883748x237](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0mhRgIpOsRjUEVu0ccXXW5umrbFwzL5v6yZYMMXSSGgHxvjbKBZ6eabV2g7gU6bOndex6w3IVwiY_5ICC51pRzAiT_qXwthQ9oFhiOLjp8n1UzYgUS2B-MGAvwM5LHs1k37IozVPryUw1LwdPUoJSyGr_AIS5fE37eN7Ql25D5IJiNbeHe8cxvEMtI0Pqg)\n\nAs of November 18th, 2022, the TVL in the farm was $332,910. The price of WELL had dropped from $0.00644 to $0.00462. It is estimated that the TVL in the farm might grow to approximately $340,000 by January 27th, 2023. In order to maintain healthy liquidity incentives for Safety Module stakers after a significant increase in staked WELL, it is recommended that the target APR be reduced from 90% to 80%. The new recommended reward speed is 1.88 WELL per second, with an end timestamp of 1674790200, which is equal to Fri Jan 27 2023 03:30:00 GMT+0000.\n\n![|626.9342891278376x237](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lt6HCw3xZfNR5iTaUnAUWtOTwucsni1d1PvysLp1YwdA-qWGzk0m7_y73i2gI7DQo7Z73sHLEL-nA-JZQ49lM-vkg-FxmwynnW0BTN4JLyEZfswrXzDOAKEJS_pLpV8gq1rY2f8kR-RROLMgma-kwCtGL9-IfY0ZQm5fFBCzIQRwj-hsi6jmkeX2iCHDiA)\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThank you for taking the time to read through my recommended updates to the distribution of WELL liquidity incentives. Please feel free to provide feedback and commentary and let me know what changes you agree or disagree with.\n\nTo date, the decentralization of the Moonwell Artemis protocol has been a success. If passed, MIP-10 will join a series of successful governance proposals that have been executed successfully thanks to insight, feedback and voting from the Moonwell community.\n\nAs mentioned in the summary, I have requested a one time grant of 100,000 WELL tokens as payment for the time and effort it took to analyze this data and create the proposal. I would encourage other community members who take on the responsibility of submitting proposals for the betterment of Moonwell to do the same.\n\nAlso, please note that though I am an independent member of the Moonwell community, I have consulted with other contributors to the Moonwell protocol in order to source past reward distribution data and sanity check the recommended changes.",

      "title": "[MIP-9] Re-balancing of MFAM/MOVR Token Liquidity Incentives",
      "content": "**Author(s):** Fechuky\n\n**Submission Date:** 11/23/2022\n## Summary\nThe Moonbeam Foundation has provided a grant of 19,852 MOVR to Moonwell Apollo liquidity providers for December in order to fuel the growth of the Moonriver ecosystem. In continuation with my previous proposal MIP-6, I  am proposing reward speed adjustments that fully distribute these liquidity incentives to the Core lending protocol, as well as adjustments of MFAM liquidity incentives to the Safety Module, and the Solarbeam MFAM<>MOVR farm.\n\nAs a part of this proposal, I have included a 100,000 MFAM grant to my wallet address. This is in line with the precedent set by community member not-taco in his first proposal on Moonwell Artemis (MIP-2), where he encouraged new people to create and maintain the protocol through governance.\n\n\n## Proposed Updates\n<ins>Reward Speed Adjustments</ins>\n\n**Safety Module:**\n* 1.56 -> 2.54 MFAM per second\n  * Target APR: 80%\n\n**DEX LP:**\n* 5.2 -> 5.28 MFAM per second\n  * Target APR: 100%\n\n**Core:**\n* 285,000 MFAM per day\n  * Target APR: ~1-8%  \n* 709 MOVR per day\n  * Target APR: ~0.82-10.72%\n\n<ins>Moonwell Contributor Grant</ins>\n* 100,000 MFAM -> 0x87E1e08eDAfD16346d8328e2CF260ff8Bdad9e84\n\nUpon execution, these new rates will come into effect and Moonwell Contributor Grant will be transferred on 11/26 03:28 UTC  +24 hour timelock.\n\n## Definitions\n\n**MFAM** - The Moonwell Apollo governance token\n\n**Liquidity Incentives** - MFAM and MOVR tokens used as rewards to incentivize liquidity growth\n\n**Core** - Moonwell Apollo protocol\n\n**DEX LP** - Solarbeam MFAM<>MOVR farm\n\n**Safety Module** - Smart contract that backstops the Moonwell Apollo protocol in case of a “shortfall event”. Users are able to stake their MFAM and receive MFAM rewards\n\n**Reward Speed** - The rate at which MFAM and MOVR are distributed to DEX LPs, ,Safety Module, and Core protocol\n\n## Overview\n500,000,000 MFAM have been designated as liquidity incentives for Moonwell Apollo and will go to the Core protocol, Safety Module, and DEX LP.These tokens are intended to be allocated over a 4 year period and are meant\nto be distributed between Core, SM and DEX. The ratio between these 3 components needs to be adjusted regularly in order to properly balance rewards and properly incentivize liquidity.\n\nBelow I have provided screenshots showing the previous balance of liquidity incentives between the 3 components and my proposed updates.\n\n## Safety Module\nI will begin by covering the Safety Module. The Safety Module’s main function is to backstop the Moonwell protocol in case of a “shortfall event”, and rewards MFAM stakers for doing so. Safety Module rewards are distributed on a per-second basis and are rewarded evenly amongst staking wallets. This rate at which MFAM is distributed is known as the reward speed.    \n\nThe last time that the Moonwell Apollo Safety Module reward speed was updated (11/02/22), there was ~56.5M MFAM staking in the SM, valued at around $137,765.26. It was estimated that the TVL in the Safety Module would grow to roughly $150,000 by 12/01/22 (4 weeks). Like on Moonwell Artemis (MIP-2), the target APR for the Moonwell Apollo Safety Module is 80%, so the reward speed was set to 1.56 MFAM/second.\n\nOn 11/18/22, there was ~73M MFAM staking in the SM, at a valuation of $109,493.14. Since 11/2/22, the price of MFAM has dropped from $0.00244 to $0.0015. It is estimated that Safety Module TVL could grow to around $150,000 by 1/27/23. Therefore, it’s recommended that the reward speed for the SM be raised from 1.56 MFAM/second to 2.54 MFAM/second in order to maintain the target 80% APR at the estimated TVL of $150,000.\n\n<img width=\"497\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-22 at 9 30 12 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/203459886-ad2f01ea-449a-4694-8f09-c5e180cc0f0e.png\">\n\n## DEX LP\nThe MFAM<>MOVR farm on Solarbeam DEX provides the liquidity that allows users to buy or sell the MFAM token on their exchange. Incentivizing TVL in this farm is important as higher liquidity equals lower slippage for those swapping MFAM tokens. LPs earn rewards for adding liquidity to the pool and staking their LP tokens (tokens received for adding liquidity to the pool). This proposal will update the “reward period” for the farm, which includes both the reward speed (number of MFAM/second that are distributed to stakers) and an ending timestamp (which defines when the reward period will end).\n\nOn 11/2/22, the MFAM<>MOVR farm on Solarbeam had a TVL of ~$373,673 and it was estimated that it would grow to around $400,000 by 12/1/22. The target APR for the farm was 100%. This resulted in a reward speed of 5.31 MFAM/second and an end timestamp of 1669951800, which signifies Fri Dec 02 2022 03:30:00 GMT+0000.\n\n<img width=\"514\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-22 at 9 30 20 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/203460655-c185c7cf-631f-40b6-b82a-d558affc60f6.png\">\n\nOn 11/18/22, the TVL in the farm was $243,606. The price of MFAM had dropped from $0.00244 to $0.0015. It is estimated that the TVL in the farm could increase to approximately $250,000 by 1/27/23. Therefore, it is recommended that the reward speed be adjusted to 5.28 MFAM/second, with an end timestamp of 1674790200, (Fri Jan 27 2023 03:30:00 GMT+0000).\n\n<img width=\"515\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-22 at 9 30 26 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/203460692-8dfc3874-2366-44a4-81dc-c7bab7a44d56.png\">\n\n## Core Protocol Rewards - MOVR\nThe Moonbeam Foundation has provided a grant of 19,852 MOVR to Moonwell Apollo liquidity providers for December in order to fuel the growth of the Moonriver ecosystem. Anyone that supplies or borrows on Moonwell Apollo will be able to claim these rewards from the Rewards modal found at the top of the Moonwell Apollo app. Like the Core Protocol MFAM rewards, these MOVR rewards are intended to incentivize LPs for providing useful liquidity to the protocol, and can also be split between each of the money markets/suppliers and borrowers at any arbitrary ratio.\n\nAs of 11/2/22, these were the reward emission ratios set for the Moonwell Apollo protocol:\n\n<img width=\"1104\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-22 at 9 30 41 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/203460762-c1b631e3-75f3-4322-a77e-f3217f604029.png\">\n\nThis new proposal keeps the emission weightage the same, and simply reduces the total emissions proportionally to match the slightly reduced grant from the Moonbeam Foundation and fully distributes the MOVR rewards:\n<img width=\"1108\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-22 at 9 30 49 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/203460843-d8c31496-dd33-4271-8fe9-58b95a29fc55.png\">\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThank you for reading my recommended updates to MFAM and MOVR liquidity incentive distributions. I hope you have taken the time to read through and understand my proposal. Please feel free to give me any feedback or questions that you may have!\n\nI would like to encourage other community members to take an active role in governance. You can share your ideas in the forums and create proposals for the betterment of the protocol! Like not-taco, I have also requested a grant for my labor and time spent in the preparation of this proposal. I would also encourage other members of the community that take on similar work to do the same!\n\nFinally, though I am an independent member of the Moonwell community, I have consulted with other Moonwell contributors regarding reward distribution data and generating/verifying proposal call data.\n\n",

      "title": "Asset Listing Framework",
      "content": "# Background\n\nTo guide best practices to the Community, Gauntlet aims to provide a standard framework for assessing market risk when listing assets and enabling assets as collateral. Managing collateral listings is essential to the growth of the protocol. As new assets in DeFi proliferate and older assets fall out of favor, Moonwell must list and delist assets to maintain its usefulness as a protocol. Given 2 weeks of notice and strong community buy-in, Gauntlet will conduct risk assessments prior to new assets being listed.\n\nThis interplays with [Open Zeppelin’s Asset listing guide](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/compound-assets-listing) and is focused specifically on market risk and how Gauntlet will support the asset listing process in Moonwell.\n\nThroughout the asset listing and collateral enablement processes, Gauntlet's goal is to ensure that insolvency and liquidity risks are minimized and that when liquidations occur, they can be done so healthily with incentivized liquidators. In order to be unbiased, Gauntlet will not explicitly support any asset listing but instead provides the below framework as guidance for the community.\n\n# Asset listing\n\nGauntlet will assess a given asset's liquidity and other market characteristics to be added to the protocol. **We ask that the party putting forward the proposal for asset listing include the following data:**\n\n- Market cap of the token\n- Total supply\n- Largest liquidity sources (exchanges including CEX and DEX)\n- Volatility per our definition [https://maker-report.gauntlet.network/int_vol](https://maker-report.gauntlet.network/int_vol) (30 day, 90 day, 1 year) (we can also help with this)\n- Average daily trading volume on CEX and DEX\n- [Gini coefficient and Herfindahl index](https://insights.glassnode.com/assessing-the-distribution-of-erc20-tokens-on-the-ethereum-network/) of token balances\n\nGauntlet will relay our findings to the community and make parameter recommendations for **Reserve Factor** and **Borrow Cap. We always recommend that Collateral Factor be set to 0 on the initial listing.** Our goal with this initial analysis is to ensure that liquidations will be feasible with the amount of supply and borrow expected to be added initially. \n\n## Reserve Factor\n\nThe Reserve Factor is more straightforward on the initial listing. We generally recommend 15% for stablecoins and 25% for non-stablecoin assets. These guidelines will evolve over time.\n\n## Borrow Cap\n\nIn general, it is prudent to err on the conservative side for Borrow Cap, as this is a direct lever for us to ensure that Moonwell can minimize losses in an infinite mint attack (and other attacks). The community needs to decide whether a given asset should be turned on for borrowing (some assets may not make sense, i.e., rebasing assets like stETH). If the community decides to turn an asset on for borrowing, Gauntlet will conduct analysis to set the asset’s Borrow Cap.\n\nGauntlet’s goal with setting the Borrow Cap on initial listing is to predict the estimated supply in Moonwell in a mature state and then being conservative to ensure that there are no unforeseen technical risks that cause protocol failure or outsized insolvencies. \n\nIn particular, Gauntlet will set Borrow Cap in the following way:\n\nFor a non-stablecoin asset, the asset will be compared with similar assets already on Moonwell. Its Borrow Cap should be set as the minimum of 50% of the supply of similar assets in Moonwell or 1% of the circulating market cap of the token. By similarity, we are looking at both:\n\n- Comparable utility of the token (i.e., pure governance, staked derivatives, etc.)\n- Comparable market structure of the token (i.e., similar market caps, ADV, vol, GINI)\n\nThe idea behind using the minimum here is to establish an upper limit relative to the token’s circulating supply and ensure that the asset is compared to other similar assets on Moonwell.\n\nFor stablecoins, we recommend no Borrow Cap because stablecoins usually have high organic demand for borrow and thus a high utilization rate, leading to more protocol revenue. \n\nOver time we will raise and potentially remove the Borrow Cap from all assets (as long as the community is comfortable with it. [Maker](https://www.comp.xyz/t/reducing-mkr-borrow-cap/2959) was a good example of keeping and lowering the Borrow Cap to prevent governance attacks.)\n\n# Collateral Enablement\n\nEnabling Collateral can be one of the riskiest phases for a new asset coming onto Moonwell. Gauntlet’s general recommendation is a conservative, phased approach. New market risks are introduced when an asset is enabled as collateral. The community should assess the technical risks and follow [OpenZeppelin’s framework](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/compound-assets-listing). Below, we outline the relevant market risks and recommendations.\n\n**The community should take the first step in proposing that an asset is enabled as collateral by publishing a post on the Moonwell Community Forums.** This forum post should contain the metrics outlined above (market cap of the token, total supply, etc.). Should there be enough community support behind enabling this asset as collateral (i.e. via a poll), Gauntlet will then provide a market risk analysis as described below. \n\n### Gauntlet Analysis for Collateral Enablement:\n\nSufficient liquidity is required for an asset prior to enabling it as collateral. A cautious test of this is the combined slippage across all liquidity sources to measure how well a given asset can be absorbed into the market (a signal that may change upon asset listing). \n\n**We recommend that the combined (CEX + DEX) slippage be less than 5% for a sell order of either $300k or 10% of total asset supplied in Moonwell (whichever is greater) before enabling an asset as collateral.** Gauntlet formulated this guideline by analyzing existing assets in Moonwell and their supplies. Then, Gauntlet modeled what the market could healthily absorb using our combined slippage model. \n\nHere is a simplified example using FRAX. For new asset listings, Gauntlet would use its slippage models, but to make the example simpler we can look at 1inch liquidity for FRAX. As of 2022-10-25, there is $7.6M of FRAX supplied in Moonwell Artemis and $13.2M in Moonwell Apollo, so max($300k, 10% of supply) equates to a $2.1M order. Looking at 1inch, we see that a $2.1M order would hit around 0.18% slippage (2022-10-25; 1inch is only DEX liquidity, so slippage numbers are better when including CEX data). \n\nNote that this is an initial guideline to broadly understand the liquidity of a given asset. As Gauntlet conducts analysis on new assets coming to the protocol, we may provide more granular analysis (i.e., around the distribution of users and around asset classes) that deviates from this guideline when we determine there is a better understanding of the market risks.\n\nOur approach is purposely conservative and leans on consistent parameter tuning to increase capital efficiency over a longer time frame in a safer manner. \n\nIt must be the case that the community supports a given asset to be turned on as collateral. This is not an assessment that can be made purely from a market risk lens, as the non-market risk side can pose a more existential threat to Moonwell (i.e., smart contract bugs).  \n\nAfter the community decides they want an asset turned on as collateral, Gauntlet’s general recommendation will start conservatively at a **20-30% CF.** This will be assessed on a per asset basis. The goal is to give enough time to the asset at a low collateralization ratio to make sure that mechanisms are working as intended. After 2 weeks of collateral enablement, Gauntlet’s ongoing parameter tuning work through simulation optimization will consider increasing Collateral Factors based on the actual usage data and market conditions as long as it is safe to do so from an insolvency risk perspective.\n\nThus, this phased approach to collateral enablement starts with conservative Collateral Factor parameterization. After the asset is enabled as collateral, Gauntlet’s financial modeling platform will continue to ingest data on how usage and market conditions evolve. At this stage, through a more thorough understanding of risk via our simulation models. Gauntlet can optimize for capital efficiency to the protocol.\n\n# Guidelines\n\n- Gauntlet will not conduct simulations using fake data to assess the risk.\n    - Simulations do not lend well to this type of listing when there is no prior data. Gauntlet has in the past used borrower distributions from similar assets to assess risk. However, this has been a weak signal given how different each asset’s usage behavior is when actually incorporated into the lending platform. As such, Gauntlet will not conduct simulation analysis to predict user behavior ahead of an asset’s listing.\n- Gauntlet will not assess any of the following areas of non-market risk and instead defer to OpenZeppelin and the community on the below:\n    - Oracle risk\n    - Infinite mint attacks\n    - Governance attacks\n    - Smart contract risk\n    - Centralization risk\n    - Other technical risks\n    - Gauntlet will treat the asset as if it serves its underlying purpose correctly and will not assess ancillary aspects of the token design. It is up to the community to decide whether a given asset belongs in the protocol.",

      "title": "[MIP-6] Re-balancing of MFAM/MOVR Token Liquidity Incentives",
      "content": "**Author(s):** Fechuky\n\n**Submission Date:** 10/29/2022\n\n**Proposal Forum Post:** [https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/278](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/278)\n## Summary\nThe Moonbeam Foundation has provided a grant of 23,822.4 MOVR to Moonwell Apollo liquidity providers for November in order to fuel the growth of the Moonriver ecosystem. I am proposing reward speed adjustments that fully distribute these liquidity incentives to the Core lending protocol, as well as adjustments of MFAM liquidity incentives to the Core lending protocol, the Safety Module, and the Solarbeam MFAM<>MOVR farm.\n\nAs a part of this proposal, I have included a 100,000 MFAM grant to my wallet address. This is in line with the precedent set by community member not-taco in his first proposal on Moonwell Artemis ([MIP-2](https://forum.moonwell.fi/t/278)), where he encouraged new people to create and maintain the protocol through governance. I have also used MIP-2 as a foundational work to help guide the creation and formatting of this proposal (MIP-6).\n\n\n## Proposed Updates\n<ins>Reward Speed Adjustments</ins>\n\n**Safety Module:**\n* 1.36 -> 1.56 MFAM per second \n  * Target APR: 80%\n\n**DEX LP:**\n* 5.31 -> 5.2 MFAM per second \n  * Target APR: 100%\n\n**Core:**\n* 285,000 MFAM per day \n  * Target APR: ~1-8%\n* 850.8 MOVR per day \n  * Target APR: ~1.05-8.3%\n\n<ins>Moonwell Contributor Grant<ins>\n\n**Grant:**\n* 100,000 MFAM -> 0x87E1e08eDAfD16346d8328e2CF260ff8Bdad9e84\n\n\n## Definitions\n\n**MFAM** - The Moonwell Apollo governance token.\n\n**Liquidity Incentives** - MFAM and MOVR tokens used as rewards to incentivize liquidity growth.\n\n**Core** - Moonwell Apollo protocol.\n\n**DEX LP** - Solarbeam MFAM<>MOVR farm \n\n**Safety Module** - Smart contract that backstops the Moonwell Apollo protocol in case of a “shortfall event”. Users are able to stake their MFAM and receive MFAM rewards.\n\n**Reward Speed** - The rate at which MFAM and MOVR are distributed to DEX LPs, Safety Module, and Core protocol.\n\n## Overview\n500,000,000 MFAM have been designated as liquidity incentives for Moonwell Apollo and will go to the Core protocol, Safety Module, and DEX LP. These tokens are intended to be allocated over a 4 year period and are meant \nto be distributed between Core, SM and DEX. The ratio between these 3 components needs to be adjusted regularly to properly balance rewards and incentivize liquidity.\n\nBelow I have provided screenshots showing the previous balance of liquidity incentives between the 3 components and my proposed updates.\n\n## Safety Module\nI will begin by covering the Safety Module. The Safety Module’s main function is to backstop the Moonwell protocol in case of a “shortfall event”, and rewards MFAM stakers for doing so. Safety Module rewards are distributed on a per-second basis and are rewarded evenly amongst staking wallets. This rate at which MFAM is distributed is known as the reward speed.       \n\nThe last time that the Moonwell Apollo Safety Module reward speed was updated (10/03/22), there was ~45.8M MFAM staking in the SM, valued at around $102,547.59. It was estimated that the TVL in the Safety Module would grow to roughly $120,000 by 11/03/22 (4 weeks). Like on Moonwell Artemis (MIP-2) the target APR for the Moonwell Apollo Safety Module is 80%, so the reward speed was set to 1.36 MFAM/second.\n \nOn 10/26/22, there was ~56.5M MFAM staking in the SM, at a valuation of $137,765.26. Since 10/03/22, the price of MFAM has risen from $0.0022 to $0.00244. It is estimated that Safety Module TVL could grow to around $150,000 by 12/01/22. Therefore, it’s recommended that the reward speed for the SM be raised from 1.36 MFAM/second to 1.56 MFAM/second in order to maintain the target 80% APR at the estimated TVL of $150,000.\n<img width=\"336\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-29 at 3 33 14 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/198852063-bdf5de35-6b6a-4039-9b73-6680525da0e3.png\">\n## DEX LP\nThe MFAM<>MOVR farm on Solarbeam DEX provides the liquidity that allows for users to buy or sell the MFAM token on their exchange. Incentivizing TVL in this farm is important as higher liquidity equals lower slippage for those swapping MFAM tokens. LPs earn rewards for adding liquidity to the pool and staking their LP tokens (tokens received for adding liquidity to pool). This proposal will update the “reward period” for the farm, which includes both the reward speed (number of MFAM/second that are distributed to stakers) and an ending timestamp (which defines when the reward period will end).\n\nOn 10/03/22, the MFAM<>MOVR farm on Solarbeam had a TVL of ~$348,990 and it was estimated that it would grow to around $375,000 by 11/03/22. The target APR for the farm was 100%. This resulted in a reward speed of 5.31 MFAM/second and an end timestamp of 1667532600, which signifies Fri Nov 04 2022 03:30:00 GMT+0000.\n<img width=\"346\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-29 at 3 33 25 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/198851957-a0d7d368-feab-43b8-a5fe-35e33e3298b6.png\">\n\nOn 10/26/22, the TVL in the farm was $373,673. The price of MFAM had risen from $0.0022 to $0.00244. It is estimated that the TVL in the farm could increase to approximately $400,000 by 12/01/22. Therefore, it is recommended that the reward speed be adjusted to 5.2 MFAM/second, with an end timestamp of 1669951800, (Fri Dec 02 2022 03:30:00 GMT+0000).\n<img width=\"344\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-29 at 3 33 35 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/198851979-8cb9123d-250b-4847-b039-0ea192eb9ce5.png\">\n## Core Protocol Rewards - MFAM\nCore protocol rewards are the rewards that are paid to suppliers and borrowers in Moonwell Apollo’s money markets and can be claimed at any time from the rewards modal at the top of the dapp. Core Protocol rewards are important as they incentivize LPs to provide useful liquidity to the protocol. Rewards can be split between each of the money markets and also between suppliers and borrowers at any arbitrary ratio.\n\nAs of 10/06/22, these were the reward emission ratios set for the Moonwell Apollo protocol:\n<img width=\"875\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-29 at 3 33 47 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/198851987-e7d64ca5-9c2e-48b1-a484-9047d02b2959.png\">\n\nThough it is not recommended that the total emissions be altered (285,000 MFAM/day), it is recommended that the weightings are adjusted in order for the rewards to more closely match the TVL changes in the below markets:\n\n* MOVR 15% -> 13%\n* KSM 10% -> 8%\n* FRAX 18% -> 20%\n* USDC 33% -> 35%\n\n<img width=\"875\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-29 at 3 33 59 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/198851990-e8e244c5-1be5-4ead-b6cd-bdc1b0c232f8.png\">\n\n## Core Protocol Rewards - MOVR\nThe Moonbeam Foundation has provided a grant of 23,822.4 MOVR to Moonwell Apollo liquidity providers for November in order to fuel the growth of the Moonriver ecosystem. Anyone that supplies or borrows on Moonwell Apollo will be able to claim these rewards from the Rewards modal found at the top of the Moonwell Apollo app. Like the Core Protocol MFAM rewards, these MOVR rewards are intended to incentivize LPs for providing useful liquidity to the protocol, and can also be split between each of the money markets/suppliers and borrowers at any arbitrary ratio.\n\nAs of 10/06/22, these were the reward emission ratios set for the Moonwell Apollo protocol:\n\n<img width=\"872\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-29 at 3 34 10 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/198851995-1d7f32e0-6553-48ac-acc7-4350a9145630.png\">\nThough this proposal will not alter the total emissions, it is recommended that the weightings are adjusted in order for the rewards to more closely match the TVL changes in the below markets:\n\n* MOVR 15% -> 13%\n* KSM 10% -> 8%\n* FRAX 18% -> 20%\n* USDC 33% -> 35%\n\n<img width=\"874\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-10-29 at 3 34 18 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107974210/198852005-e385626c-e127-41bd-99f2-b763be86fb43.png\">\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThank you for reading my recommended updates to MFAM and MOVR liquidity incentive distributions. I hope you have taken the time to read through and understand my proposal. Please feel free to give me any feedback or questions that you may have!\n\nI’ve followed the lead of not-taco and his proposal (MIP-2) to adjust WELL liquidity incentive distributions on Moonwell Artemis. I would like to encourage other community members to take an active role in governance. You can share your ideas in the forums and create proposals for the betterment of the protocol! Like not-taco, I have also requested a grant for my labor and time spent in the preparation of this proposal. I would also encourage other members of the community that take on similar work to do the same!\n\nFinally, though I am an independent member of the Moonwell community, I have consulted with other Moonwell contributors regarding reward distribution data and generating/verifying proposal call data.\n",

Estimated LAR is $880k and our recommendation would decrease to $879k. ETH.multi and USDT.multi are relatively safe from a market risk perspective, so their collateral factor can gradually increase to improve capital efficiency. USDC.multi and xcKSM collateral factors are currently at an optimal balance of risk and capital efficiency. FRAX can be de-risked with a relatively small cost in capital efficiency, so we recommend decreasing its collateral factor to reduce insolvency risk.\n\n### Potential Forced Liquidations:\nWhenever we lower collateral factors, there's a chance that some users may immediately become liquidatable as a result. There are a number of accounts that lend and borrow stablecoins and keep their balances just slightly above the liquidation threshold. Reducing the collateral factor of FRAX by 0.5% would push 1 account from just above the collateral factor to just below the collateral factor. The account has a total borrow of $15k USD.\n\nThe below figures show trends on key market statistics regarding the top borrowers with FRAX collateral with their total borrow balance and estimated borrower usage if the collateral factor was reduced to 59.20%. None of the top 10 will be liquidated:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/XwgMiB9.png)\n\n\n### Top 10 borrowers’ Entire Borrows\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FUMiokp.png)\n\n### Utilization Rate Over Time\n![](https://i.imgur.com/3Wd6h11.png)\n\n\n\n\n## Quick Links\n\n*Please click below to learn about our methodologies:*\n\n[Gauntlet Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c)\n[Gauntlet Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

      "title": "Bridges: Path Forward",
      "content": "## Summary\n- Following the Nomad exploit, our community has to start putting up signal votes to poll for which bridge they would like to use going forward. Below is a robust process of analysis for key design decisions affecting the community largely reproduced verbatim from [this article](https://stellaswap.medium.com/rebuilding-strategy-a-framework-for-evaluating-bridges-on-moonbeam-359701c5c461) by StellaSwap. The credit for this analysis belongs to the StellaSwap team. \n- Three bridges: Multichain, Axelar, and Wormhole are compared on the basis of three aspects: Security, Financial Coverage, and User Experience. The bridges were chosen on the basis of being likely candidates to become ecosystem partners. \n- The proposed vote is a Ranked Choice vote that also offers “Other” (use forum) and “No Bridge” as options. \n\n\n## Introduction\nMoonwell Artemis mitigated the damage from the Nomad exploit by quickly disabling borrowing when the attack started, but the ecosystem needs to fill the void left over after the exploit. Looking ahead entails planning for the infrastructure towards rebuilding. It is therefore vital to ensure that there is a robust and rigorous process of analysis for key design decisions affecting the community.\n## Potential Bridges on Moonbeam\n- **MultiChain**: Multichain is a cross-chain router protocol that is currently one of the most popular bridges in DeFi. With a total TVL exceeding $2.5 billion across 62 different blockchain networks, Multichain has possibly the largest market share in the space.\n- **Axelar**: Axelar is a permissionless overlay network that has been at the forefront of pioneering work on cross-chain communication with its general message passing (GMP). Axelar was recently chosen as the official cross chain service provider for Osmosis, the largest DEX on Cosmos.\n- **Wormhole**: Wormhole is a generalized cross-chain messaging platform connecting high-value blockchains together, with applications leveraging the messaging layer to facilitate interoperability between ecosystems. Wormhole is backed by Jump, a behemoth with tentacles across market-making, a venture capital arm and, increasingly, a team of in-house developers who contribute to projects on several major blockchains.\n\n## Bridge Evaluation Parameters\nThis section discusses several parameters to evaluate a bridge.\n- Security: The most vital factor for evaluation, covering trust mechanism and security assurances. The former covers the spectrum of trust assumptions embedded within their logic and (operational) verifiers instituted in the system, while the latter covers the depth of audits, code deployment process and external bounties.\n- Financial Coverage: The degree of financial backing, whether internally embedded within the protocol’s model (i.e. reserve fund) or externally via a network of backers, in the adverse event of any exploit.\n- User Experience: The overall experience when using a bridge including usability, intuitiveness, speed and slippage, amongst other things.\nWe shall explore each parameter for each of the aforementioned protocols together with the context of the general Moonbeam ecosystem.\n\n\n## Evaluation Parameter #1: Security\nIt is no surprise that the biggest hacks recorded in DeFi are bridge exploits, as the cumulative amount of funds locked in bridges make them a primary target for attackers. The Nomad exploit underlined the need for a comprehensive and fully robust security framework; it is simply not enough to have a secure architectural logic without a corresponding emphasis on secure operational measures. In fact, 3 out of 4 of the biggest bridge hacks — Ronin, Womhole and most recently Nomad — was due to operational failures.\nIt is therefore vital to analyze the full-suite of security elements that not only include the architectural logic, but also — with equal emphasis — the respective operational security measures and safety measures determining the protocol’s code quality.\n\n![Security.png](ipfs://bafkreidby5h4ocf2f2zgn3s4m6jqmz6ljj6fi4tbf55vyxjuptdfdv76la) \n#### Multichain\nMultichain utilizes secure multi-party computation (SMPC) to run threshold signature schemes (TSS) for the creation of public keys and for the signature of messages. Thes validation nodes trustlessly control externally owned accounts (EOAs) with public addresses corresponding to the split private key. These EOAs are then used to store & transport assets to the destination chain ; they simply check whether the sender’s address is trusted relative to verifying the message itself. The Multichain network currently consists of 24 SMPC nodes, run by different institutions, and requires a majority of nodes to come together to verify messages. Multichain’s security is dependent on the reputational security of the SMPC nodes, which assumes an honest majority of more than 1/2 of all nodes. 13 signatories are needed to send data cross-chain and 12 nodes need to collude to censor messages. Multichain is currently testing their enhanced MPC version called fastMPC, which offers increased speed, better performance and enhanced security. No proxy contracts are used on the network and Multichain ensures that there is a designated and separated ETH EOA address to lock funds.\n#### Axelar\nAxelar runs on a decentralized Proof-of-Stake network predicated on Cosmos SDK, where validators are elected by token holders and given voting rights on a pro-rata basis, weighted by the stake delegated to them. Cross-chain messages are verified by the Axelar network via a (t,n)-threshold signature scheme where the voting power of the signers, normalized to n, must be greater than t, the protocol threshold, to sign a message. The Axelar network currently has a maximum of 50 validators and must exceed a 66.67% voting majority to sign messages. Another unique feature of Axelar is that it is in the midst of implementing a quadratic voting mechanism to further increase decentralization of the network. This is groundbreaking work since concentration of power has been a heavily discussed topic with regards to POS systems.\n#### Wormhole\nWormhole uses a Proof-of-Authority Guardian network as an oracle and a permissionless relayer network to transmit messages cross-chain. There are currently 19 Guardians that runs full nodes for each of Wormhole’s supported chains and listens for messages emitted by Wormhole’s core contracts on each chain. These Guardians verify and sign these messages, and thereafter relays them to one another on a P2P network. Once a message is received, signatures from more than 2/3 of the Guardians (or at least 13 Guardians), it’s relayed to the target chain. A byproduct of this design is that it allows for a completely trustless relayer network to land the message on the destination chain. Since these messages are signed by the Guardians, it is not possible to either change the contents of the message or censor it as anyone can run a relayer to submit any message. The security guarantee of Wormhole comes from the reputational authority of the Guardians, which is made up of 19 of the largest staking and infrastructure providers in Web3. 13 Guardians would need to collude to sign a false message, and 7 Guardians would need to collude to censor a message. Moreover, the existing Guardian set has the ability to vote to remove or replace Guardians.\n    \n## Evaluation Parameter #2: Financial Coverage\nClose to $2 billion has been compromised in cross-chain exploits so far in 2022. This is expected to be a recurring theme in DeFi, given the infancy of the technology. Cross-chain bridges are especially vulnerable, given the sheer amount of funds locked in their respective smart contracts. As robust and comprehensive the security of a protocol is, there is no guarantee that it can protect itself from any and every threat.\nTherefore, it is vital to assess a bridge’s ability from a financial coverage point-of-view. Generally, a bridge that possess the financial capacity to backstop losses due to an exploit would exhibit greater levels of confidence. Let’s take a look at two opposite examples of bridges with financial coverage;\nNomad Bridge Exploit: Nomad bridge was exploited on the 1st of August this year, resulting in a loss of more than $186 million. As the defacto bridge of Moonbeam, many affected users saw their funds diminish in value and thee overall ecosystem TVL plummeted from $187 million to sub-$60 million. Users and affected protocols, like StellaSwap, is still awaiting for the resolution plan from Nomad\nWormhole Bridge Hack: On Feb 2 this year, Wormhole’s bridge was exploited for $320 million (120k ETH). Within 24 hours, the vulnerability was fixed and the bridge resumed operations after Jump Crypto, the backers of Wormhole, backstopped the bridge. As users were made whole, confidence was restored and ecosystem TVL recovered within days.\nIt would therefore be advantageous for a bridge to possess deep pockets in order to backstop losses due to exploits and hacks. This section takes a look at the financial capacity of each bridge.\n![Financial Coverage.png](ipfs://bafkreidwgb5e3m6eedmqs7jdlwosyhyuyvkmrzp32mh6xrzk2oadl4tcpa)\n\n#### Multichain\nMultichain has showed a great precedent in backstopping the losses from exploits, ensuring that users are made whole. The reaction of their exploits entailed the creation of a security fund, to ensure that there will be a sustainable source of funds for potential exploits down the line.\n#### Axelar\nAxelar on the other hand, has not suffered from any exploit to their credit. However, it must be put into context that Axelar launched this year and is the youngest bridge thus far, and therefore it may not be in the firing line for hackers just yet. A good buffer that has been implemented is their insurance fund that is inherent in their tokenomics.\n#### Wormhole\nAlthough Wormhole has suffered one of the largest exploits in DeFi, Wormhole exhibited the highest confidence for financial coverage. The $320M shortfall was covered in under 24 hours, as compared to Multichain’s response, in which they confirmed their reimbursement plan approximately a month after their latest hack. Beyond that, the prominence of Jump across the cryptocurrency system is well-known and goes beyond financial coverage, as they have expertise and networks across major financial functions. For instance, Jump’s capital deployment in Solana has been measured to surpass billions of dollars across the functions of market-making, arbitraging and institutional networks. Granted, this does not pertain directly to the function of bridging, but it represents a highly beneficial proposition to assess as it could enrich the entire ecosystem.\n\n## Evaluation Parameter #3: User Experience\nIn the long-run, the popularity of any bridge will depend on its usability and overall user experience. Users must generally be happy with the bridging experience for a bridge to be successful. StellaSwap has worked with Multichain, Axelar, Nomad and Celer, allowing us to fully understand the variables that goes into analyzing an optimized user experience when it comes to bridging.\n\nAcross the board, the latency and fees is pretty standard and falls in line with the general expectations of users. Multichain stands tall in terms of connectivity, with comprehensive support across numerous blockchain networks and asset support. Although Axelar is the youngest bridge, their pace of growth is lightning with 17 blockchain networks so far, with their recent achievement being selected as the defacto bridge for Osmosis, the leading DEX on Cosmos. Wormhole is seemingly employing a more focused approach towards Layer-1 integration.\nUI/UX wise, Multichain and Wormhole edges out Axelar incrementally.\n \n![User Experience.png](ipfs://bafkreihxhf5cjpu27j2atgz4562okpwqrw3rylqcuszywgssnqetid7wxi)\n     \n\n    ",

I, personally, feel comfortable moving forward,\nand [the accompanying snapshot vote](https://snapshot.moonwell.fi/#/proposal/0x8aafe2be372da99a003ffc2b4469fa5d61a155be882a4814e1c47ac5f1f1b4c3)\nhas indicated overwhelmingly that the WELL holders agree as well.\n\nAs indicated by the snapshot, this proposal intends to codify immediately moving the collateral factor to 0% and reserve factor to 100% on all Nomad assets in order to\nre-enable borrowing on Moonwell and move the protocol forwards all at once.\n\nThe specific associated governance actions to make this a reality are as follows:\n\n1. Decrease the collateral factor to 0% on USDC.mad, wBTC.mad, and ETH.mad\n2. Increase the reserve factor to 100% on USDC.mad, wBTC.mad, and ETH.mad\n3. Re-enable borrowing on GLMR, xcDOT, and FRAX\n4. Re-enable mToken transfers\n\nThe result of these actions should put Moonwell in a place where borrowing and lending with the native assets is working well again.\n\n> Note: I've shared a draft of this proposal copy and received _very_ well-tested action callData from the Moonwell team (the proposal was thoroughly unit tested on a Moonbeam testnet).\n",

Community members can be added/removed as desired with snapshot votes in the future.\n\nWithin the protocol, there is also the notion of a “Sunset Period”, controlled by the `guardianSunset` variable, currently set to end on`1676142714`, i.e. Saturday, February 11, 2023 7:11:54 PM GMT (https://www.epochconverter.com/?q=1676142714). After this period the DAO can elect to remove this functionality from the DAO contract and render the “Break Glass Guardian” and “Governance Return Guardian” roles inert.\n\n## Ratification:\nIf a majority of voters vote YAY on the protocol, the proposed community multisig (https://multisig.moonbeam.network/mbeam:0x5402447a0db03EeE98c98b924F7d346bd19cdD17/settings/owners) will be promoted to the protocol “break glass guardian” by setting `breakGlassGuardian` variable to 0x5402447a0db03EeE98c98b924F7d346bd19cdD17.\nIf a majority of voters vote NAY, or the proposal fails to hit quorum, this proposal will be considered defeated.",
