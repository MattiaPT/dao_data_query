      "content": "## Goal of the Vote\n\nThis snapshot vote is to determine community sentiment toward a 3 month trial period to compensate active delegate governance participation.\n\n*Current Bootstrap Delegates and self-nominated candidates should abstain in this snapshot vote to avoid any potential conflict of interest.*\n\n## Scope\n\nThe forum post on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549) and is a follow-up vote to the previous snapshot vote at [https://snapshot.org/#/0xgov.eth/proposal/0x525061665f30d6e2e4441a1b90e7dda55fc45c289ee7cd7526a5ca9bdb70b628](https://snapshot.org/#/0xgov.eth/proposal/0x525061665f30d6e2e4441a1b90e7dda55fc45c289ee7cd7526a5ca9bdb70b628).\n\nIn summary, the goal of the proposed experiment is to reactivate inactive voting power in response to the drop in overall voting participation over the past 18 months which has made it difficult to put treasury funds to productive use.\n\nBeyond reallocating voting power, an additional component to the proposed experiment is compensating active governance participation. Being an active voting member requires time and effort and anecdotally, other communities/projects have seen that compensation is a successful method of attracting participation from representatives with diverse domain knowledge, skillsets, experiences, and points of view.\n\n## Structure of Trial Compensation\n\nThe trial will last 3 months and require a budget of ~$15k. This budget will be used to compensate the 5 current active bootstrap delegates (Nikita, Joao, SHA, Gabrigo, Polygon Foundation) and 7 new delegates at a rate of $715/month and $205/month respectively. The difference in compensation rate is to account for the relative difference in voting power (1.5M vs. ~430k). \n\nWhile all of the delegates are eligible for compensation, receiving it requires (1) participating in the initial forum discussions, (2) voting, and (3) providing a brief explanation of their vote on a minimum of 85% of the treasury votes that are held each month of the 3 month trial period.\n\nIn terms of the mechanics of distributing this compensation, I, Eric Wong, will serve as the administrator. In this role, I will track delegate participation in forum discussion, voting, and explanation in this [publicly viewable spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a3RLui-gfuYZec2Gp-c091IYFOi4z6x_P4fC9_6wv38/edit#gid=0) and serve as the intermediary holder of the funds from the treasury through this wallet `0x84BDa0f95993a03F45c982296496d4F2CC524062`. All funds that remain after this 3 month trial period will be sent back to the treasury.\n\nIf this snapshot vote passes, a subsequent treasury vote is still required to transfer the funds. That treasury vote would request a transfer of ZRX from the treasury to the address above. The amount of ZRX would be determined closer to that date due to variation in ZRX’s price.\n\n## Do you support the 3 month trial around compensating active delegate governance participation?",

      "content": "## Goal of the Vote\n\nThis snapshot vote is to gather community sentiment toward reallocating the inactive voting power that was initially delegated during the Bootstrap Delegate initiative evenly across the self-nominated community members.\n\n*Note that this proposal is a variation of the original experiment proposed in the governance forum in two ways that are described below.*\n\n## Scope\n\nThe forum post on this topic can be found at [https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549).\n\nIn summary, the goal of the proposed experiment is to reactivate inactive voting power in response to the drop in overall voting participation over the past 18 months by empowering new community members.\n\nOver the past week, 7 community members have self-nominated themselves to be considered for the reallocated voting power. Below is an alphabetized list of them linked to their self-nomination:\n\n* [Aishwary](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/4)\n* [Celo](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/12)\n* [Daniel](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/8)\n* [GFX Labs](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/5)\n* [Flipside Crypto](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/2)\n* [Koppany](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/13)\n* [Patrick](https://gov.0x.org/t/rfc-short-term-delegation-experiment/3549/3)\n\nIf this vote is successful, the 3M cumulative voting power that was initially delegated to SonOfPegasus and DeFi Saver will be evenly reallocated across these 7 new community members. \n\nAs noted in the top of this vote description, this proposal differs from the original one presented in the governance forum in both process and outcome.  \n* (1) instead of 2 snapshot votes, one to measure sentiment around reallocating inactive voting power and one to indicate support for individuals to receive that reallocation, the variation is 1 snapshot vote to measure sentiment to reallocate inactive voting power to all self-nominated community members;\n* (2) instead of reallocating to 3 new members, the variation is to reallocate to all 7 self-nominated members.\n\n**Given that the goal was to increase the number of individuals/groups participating in governance, I believe that these changes are appropriate and do not introduce any significant deviation.**\n\nIf this vote passes, there will also be one more snapshot vote to measure community sentiment for delegate compensation which is the second component of the proposed experiment.\n\n## Do you support the reallocation of delegated voting power from inactive Bootstrap Delegates to new community members?",

      "content": "Forum post: https://gov.0x.org/t/temperature-checks-snapshot-voting-privacy-setting/3439\n\n### Goal of the vote\nThis poll is to utilize Snapshot's \"Voter Privacy\" setting for use in future off-chain snapshot votes. (Disclaimer: voter privacy is turned on for this Snapshot temporarily as a POC and will be reverted if this vote does not pass)\n\n### Context\nSnapshot proposals are currently used to gauge community sentiment on serious topics under consideration for onchain governance votes that impact 0x protocol.\n\nCurrently, snapshot votes use the default voting privacy setting which shows the result of an ongoing poll in real time. As of October 2022, Snapshot integrated with ShutterDAO to enable an opt-in voting privacy setting which will encrypt votes while the poll is live and only review the result when the voting period is over.\n\n### Why Opt-in to Voting Privacy?\nWhile 1 token 1 vote has made participating in governance easier, there are some major shortcomings to it as talked about by prominent people within the blockchain space Vitalik (1, 2, 3). Highlighting two of the problems here are (1) plutarchy, or the ability for wealth/capital to heavily influence vote results, (2) bribery & collusion, or the ability for highly coordinated individuals/groups to heavily influence vote results. As a consequence of suboptimal governance, we also see (3) voter apathy or low participation.\n\nWhile Opting into voting privacy does not solve all of these problems completely, I think that it would be a meaningful experiment and be a step in the right direction. In terms of how hiding the current result of a vote while it is still live could address each of those three problems above specifically\n\n1. Plutarchy - increases the cost for an attacker to influence the result since it’s not clear how many votes they’d need to get their preferred outcome.\n2. Bribery & Collusion - reduce strategic voting for non-basic voting systems (i.e. rank-based where people might not vote truthfully if it increases the change of their preferred option winning)\n3. Voter Apathy - reduce the feeling that a vote doesn’t matter since it’s unclear what the current tally is\n\n## Do you support turning on Voter Privacy for future Snapshot votes?",

Sharp increase in Q1 and Q2 due to high gas prices and increased volume of open orderbook (limit order) trades\n\n2. Sharp decrease in Q3 due to lower gas prices (in particular, the explosion of Flashbots and other MEV schemes) and increased competition for open orderbook liquidity\n\n[see chart in forum post]\n\nGoing forward as L2s start to gain traction and in the absence of some compelling event, the downward trend is likely to continue. \n\nHypothesis\nIf protocol fees are eliminated (temporarily, in this case), open orderbook volume will increase. Additionally, swap volume could increase as well due to user behavior/loyalty. \n\nThe data gathered from this experiment can be used to inform a tokenomics redesign, which is top-of-mind for protocol stakeholders. \n\nNote: We could also reduce the fee temporarily rather than eliminating it, but that would provide a weaker signal and not be as useful an experiment.\n\nOther Factors to Consider\nStaking performance will be negatively impacted; however, it is already being impacted by the factors described above. \n\nVoting Options\n1. Yes (temporarily eliminate protocol fees on open orderbook trades)\n2. No (keep the current fee structure)\n",

      "title": "Z-2 0x/Polygon Grant Budget for 0xEVE",
      "content": "TL;DR\nWe propose additional funding be allocated to the 0x Ecosystem Value Experiment (0xEVE) due to a change in conditions from the original budget proposal. The purpose is not so much to increase the budget as it is to enable access to the MATIC that was allocated to the Treasury after 0xEVE was established and to expand the original goals to include use cases on the Polygon Network. \n\nBackground\nA proposal to establish the 0x Ecosystem Value Experiment (0xEVE) was passed in early June with a budget of 400K ZRX, which was then transferred to the 0xEVE multisig to fund operations. Shortly afterwards, 0xLabs and 0xPolygon allocated 3.3M ZRX and 4.2M MATIC to the 0xDAO Treasury with the shared goal of bringing 1M new users to the Polygon Network via 0x-powered applications. \n\nSince that time, 0xEVE has established a grant program and published a framework for projects seeking support from the 0xDAO. However, because 0xEVE has no access to these new funds, it will be extremely difficult given the current market conditions (and the commensurate devaluation of our operating budget in USD terms) for us to incorporate this new goal into the grant program in any meaningful way, particularly because we are not able to spend any of the MATIC in the Treasury. \n\nRequest for Approval \nIn keeping with the original structure of the budget where ~10% of the Treasury was allocated to 0xEVE to fund opportunities, we propose that 10% of the new funding (ZRX and MATIC) be allocated to 0xEVE to fund activities associated with this new initiative. A separate multisig will be set up to manage and track these expenditures. \n\nCompensation will remain as authorized in the original budget, and the new funding will be allocated 100% to grants and other operational activities specific to Polygon. In accordance with the grant program framework, this will enable 0xEVE to fast track grants under $50k using its own budget, while larger grants will require an onchain community vote and will be awarded from Treasury funds.\n\nAdditionally, as 0x protocol deploys to additional chains, for any future allocations from similar joint initiatives, we recommend that they be structured the same way (90/10 split between the Treasury and 0xEVE) so that 0xEVE can actively participate in evaluating, distributing, and managing grants and other associated efforts designed to accelerate adoption and ecosystem value capture. \n\nAs stipulated in Z-1, 0xEVE is a limited-duration experiment (26 weeks) and any funds not used will be returned to the Treasury when the experiment concludes. \n\nAction Required\nTransfer 330,813 ZRX and 420,000 MATIC to 0xEVE (multisig TBD).\n\nSnapshot Vote\nYes, allocate 10% of the new funding to 0xEVE\nNo, all new funding remains in the Treasury\n",
