      "title": "Compound Bug Bounty Program with Immunefi",
      "content": "**Summary**\n\nAfter working closely with many of Compound DAO’s delegates, Immunefi is working with PGov to bring our proposal to an onchain vote to further develop the existing bug bounty program for Compound and to host it on Immunefi’s platform. Our platform will provide access to industry-leading security researchers and will provide a greater long-term security that benefits Compound and its community. \n\nDuring the development of the public proposals, we focused on providing a thorough bug bounty program while structuring the backend details such as the creation of the bounty program, deciding on the program administrators, the features of the subscription packaging, bug report reviews, and the validation and payment processes.\n\nMore details can be found in the two public proposals below:\n\n[<u>First Proposal</u>](https://www.comp.xyz/t/immunefi-bug-bounty-program-for-compound-finance/5477)\n\n[<u>Second Proposal/Update</u>](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-immunefi-bug-bounty-draft-and-proposal-update/5771) (includes scope of Compound’s bug bounty program)\n\n**Reward Structure and Fee**\n\nThe bug bounty reward breakdown for the severity payout to the security researchers is as follows:\n\n* Critical: $50,000 - $1,000,000\n* High: $10,000 - $50,000\n* Medium: $5,000\n* Low: $1,000\n\nThis breakdown is based on our current client roster along with Compound’s position in the rankings of CMC, Coingecko, and DefiLlama. The program will be able to payout the reward in COMP. The reward suggestion above is based on the top tier DeFi lending protocol on our platform such as Sky (formerly MakerDAO), Sparks, AAVE, and Morpho.\n\nImmunefi’s annual subscription fee is $57,500, which includes the highest tier Managed Triage Services, access to Safe Harbor, 30 KYCs for security researchers, the program design, and hosting of the program. The highest tier of Managed Triage Services was requested by the bounty program administrators as a result of the preliminary technical assessment of every report that the Immunefi team provides before it is prepared and delivered to the administrators for validity of a bug report. \n\n**Program Administrators, Bug Report Review, and Bug Fixes** \n\nAll Bug Reports that pass through Immunefi will be reviewed by OpenZeppelin, Dmitry, and Arr00, with Compound Labs as secondary eyes if a conclusion cannot be reached. If necessary, the Immunefi meditation team will also be able to assist in mediating issues arising from the review of the bug report with the security researchers. \n\nThough Immunefi considers any processes around fixing bug reports to be outside the consideration of payments, it is understood that this needs to be accounted for in a DAO environment. Specifically, fixes may take more time to be implemented, and need to be fully deployed before payouts can be made due to the need for the payment process to be more transparent with DAO processes. For example, if a payout process is initiated while a bug still has not been fixed, it may provide enough information for one or more people to find the vulnerability and exploit it. Because of this, payments to the security researcher may be delayed until a discovered bug has been appropriately addressed.\n\n\n\n**Budget:**\n\n$57,500 for ImmuneFi will be sent to: 0x7119f398b6c06095c6e8964c1f58e7c1baa79e18\n\n$500,000 for the Bug Bounty will be sent to: 0x429D01a5ff7f7880081f858B50C26452255477f5. This multisig is controlled by the reviewers and governance working group. The remaining $500,000 budgeted will only be sent if this first half is exhausted.",

      "title": "Aera <> Compound Extension",
      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nFor over a year, the Compound DAO has used Aera for treasury management. This proposal builds upon prior work to further operationalize the DAO's treasury.\n\nThere is currently an excess of USDC and DAI reserves in Compound V2, which could be deployed in lending markets to generate yield for the treasury. Additionally, a portion of the ETH in the Compound Treasury can be utilized to generate yield.\n\nThis continuation of the existing programs will enable the DAO to drive a new yield source. The expected impact of this proposal is $30M~ in additional Compound V3 TVL and $1M+ in additional treasury revenue via yield generation.\n\nDeployment details:\n* Compound Treasury (2,000 ETH)\n* Compound V2 Reserve Assets (15M DAI and 10M USDC)\n* The vault’s objective function will be updated from targeted volatility to yield generation. This ensures the stablecoin reserves do not get allocated to volatile assets.\n* The vault will continue to allocate into Compound V3 lending markets to generate yield on the underlying assets (this will be enabled in a subsequent proposal due to Compound's 10 action limit in governance proposals).\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [Forum Post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/aera-for-compound-extension/5852).\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal is 1 of 2 proposals, the second of which will be put onchain after this one passes. The proposals are split up in order to operate within Compound's 10 action limit on proposals:\n\n1. Add `DAI` as an asset to the vault\n2. Accept ownership of a new hooks module at address `0x8A216F2C84a3fE5a51Bf57B685864A065D14C53a`. We need to deploy a new hooks module and have the Governor Bravo timelock accept ownership of it to work around a limitation in Governor Bravo that only 10 actions can be called in a single proposal. Without this workaround, adding the following function sighashes would put this proposal over that limit. This new hooks module already has all the existing hooks, plus the following new sighashes: cWETHv3 `supply` & `withdraw`, and DAI `approve` (needed to trade it for USDC)\n3. Remove current cUSDCv3 C3PO from the asset registry. In a subsequent proposal we will be adding this back in. We are removing it due to a bug in  solc and via-ir flag being able to verify the existing contract onchain (which has been successfully used for over 1 year, but cannot be verified on etherscan due to this bug).\n4. Wrap a portion of the ETH currently in the timelock into WETH\n5. _reduceReserves on both DAI and USDC V2 reserves\n6. Approve WETH, DAI, and USDC to be deposited into the Aera vault\n7. Deposit the assets into the Aera vault",

      "content": "## Proposal summary\n\nCompound Growth Program [AlphaGrowth] proposes the deployment of Compound III to the Mainnet network. This proposal takes the governance steps recommended and necessary to initialize a Compound III USDS market on Mainnet; upon execution, cUSDSv3 will be ready for use. Simulations have confirmed the market’s readiness, as much as possible, using the [Comet scenario suite](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/tree/main/scenario). The new parameters include setting the risk parameters based off of the [recommendations from Gauntlet](https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-collateral-usds-market-on-eth-mainnet/5781/5).\n\nFurther detailed information can be found on the corresponding [proposal pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/942), [deploy market GitHub action run](https://github.com/woof-software/comet/actions/runs/11392132048) and [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-collateral-usds-market-on-eth-mainnet/5781).\n\n\n## wstETH price feed\n\nFor LSTs, the goal is to use full exchange rate price feeds. Thus, we treat that stETH:ETH is 1:1.\n\n## sUSDS and sUSDe collaterals\n\nGauntlet suggests having sUDSS and sUSDe collaterals. This proposal does not include them, because the price feed is under the audit. We suggest to start bootstrapping the liquidity without these collaterals and as the price feed is audited, we will add these collaterals. We discussed it with Gauntlet, and we received the approval to have such an approach.\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThe first proposal action sets the CometFactory for the new Comet instance in the existing Configurator.\n\nThe second action configures the Comet instance in the Configurator.\n\nThe third action deploys an instance of the newly configured factory and upgrades the Comet instance to use that implementation.\n\nThe fourth action configures the existing rewards contract for the newly deployed Comet instance.\n\nThe fifth action reduces Compound’s [cDAI](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5d3a536E4D6DbD6114cc1Ead35777bAB948E3643) reserves and transfers it to Timelock, in order to convert it to USDS to then seed the market reserves for the cUSDSv3 Comet.\n\nThe sixth action approves DAI to DAI-to-USDS native converter.\n\nThe seventh action converts DAI to USDS with 1:1 ratio and transfers USDS to cUSDSv3 Comet.\n\nThe eight action updates the ENS TXT record `v3-official-markets` on `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`, updating the official markets JSON to include the new Ethereum Mainnet cUSDSv3 market.",

This proposal builds upon prior work to further operationalize the DAO's treasury.\n\nThere is currently an excess of USDC and DAI reserves in Compound V2, which could be deployed in lending markets to generate yield for the treasury. Additionally, a portion of the ETH in the Compound Treasury can be utilized to generate yield.\n\nThis continuation of the existing programs will enable the DAO to drive a new yield source. The expected impact of this proposal is $30M~ in additional Compound V3 TVL and $1M+ in additional treasury revenue via yield generation.\n\nDeployment details:\n* Compound Treasury (2,000 ETH)\n* Compound V2 Reserve Assets (15M DAI and 10M USDC)\n* The vault’s objective function will be updated from targeted volatility to yield generation. This ensures the stablecoin reserves do not get allocated to volatile assets.\n* The vault will continue to allocate into Compound V3 lending markets to generate yield on the underlying assets.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the [Forum Post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/aera-for-compound-extension/5852).\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThis proposal will:\n\n1.

Accept ownership of a new hooks module at address `0x8A216F2C84a3fE5a51Bf57B685864A065D14C53a`. We need to deploy a new hooks module and have the Governor Bravo timelock accept ownership of it to get around a limitation in Governor Bravo that only 10 actions can be called in a single proposal. Without this workaround, adding the following function sighashes would put this proposal over that limit. This new hooks module already has all the existing hooks, plus the following new sighashes: cWETHv3 `supply` & `withdraw`, and DAI `approve` (needed to trade it for USDC)\n4. Wrap a portion of the ETH currently in the timelock into WETH\n5. _reduceReserves on both DAI and USDC V2 reserves\n6. Approve WETH, DAI, and USDC to be deposited into the Aera vault\n7.

The new parameters include setting the risk parameters based off of the [recommendations from Gauntlet](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-base-aero-comet-recommendations/5790).\n\nFurther detailed information can be found on the corresponding [proposal pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/937), [deploy market GitHub action run](https://github.com/woof-software/comet/actions/runs/11259792818) and [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-base-aero-comet-recommendations/5790).\n\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThe first proposal action sets the CometFactory for the new Comet instance in the existing Configurator.\n\nThe second action configures the Comet instance in the Configurator.\n\nThe third action deploys an instance of the newly configured factory and upgrades the Comet instance to use that implementation.\n\nThe fourth action configures the existing rewards contract for the newly deployed Comet instance.\n\nTODO: Seed reserves.\n\nThe sixth action updates the ENS TXT record `v3-official-markets` on `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`, updating the official markets JSON to include the new Ethereum Mainnet cwstETHv3 market.",

      "content": "## Compound Grants Program (CGP) Renewal\n\n### Summary\n\nAfter successfully running Compound grants for the past 12 months, the Compound Grants team proposes to renew the proposal with a budget of $1.375M for another period of 12 months. The first two iterations ran from [<u>January to May 2023</u>](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) and [<u>November 2023 to May 2024</u>](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/189)\n\nDuring the previous grant programs, our focus has been sourcing and funding high-quality proposals aligned with the domain-specific RFPs ratified by the Compound community. Moreover, we have received [<u>great feedback</u>](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-updates-and-renewal/4518) from the community, builders, and domain allocators regarding renewing CGP and are grateful for their valuable input. \n\n### Program Overview\n\nDuring the Compound grants periods, we have also made sure to update the community [<u>every month</u>](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-monthly-updates/4920) and over the community calls about the progress of Compound Grants. We also led [<u>Demo Days</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RrPPhR_wOEzgk9FSVexNwJezNNXiCCkR/view?pli=1) to showcase the grantee projects with the community. \n\nIn our efforts to fund only the most impactful projects that align with Compound’s RFPs, we have strongly emphasized the quality of the proposals received. As a result of this increased selectivity and focus on excellence, our proposal acceptance rate has decreased by half compared to previous iterations of the grants program. \n\nOverall, we received 92 proposals over two quarters and accepted 23, with an acceptance rate of 25%. The CGP team allocated ~$489,000 and disbursed $249,000 to projects from both iterations. A summary of the previous iteration and the details of funded proposals can be found below. \n\nA detailed overview of each accepted proposal across both iterations can be viewed [<u>here</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11nTml9tB-88mfwj0P98frKqQTrHSFVZcG4LWcRfO228/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nP.S: We are not optimizing for the quantity of the proposals or the higher acceptance rate, but optimizing for the quality of the proposals in the grants program.

While our primary focus during this time was to gather input from the community, keeping the application process open resulted in a substantial backlog of proposals that needed to be reviewed when the program was renewed, often leading to longer review TATs.&#x20;\n   To address this issue, we closed the application process immediately upon the conclusion of the current iteration of the grants program on May 30th, 2024. By doing so, we aim to ensure a more efficient and streamlined review process for future grant proposals, allowing us to allocate our resources effectively and provide timely responses to applicants in the next iteration.&#x20;\n2. **Minimizing the gap between milestone payout transaction queue and execution leads is essential to ensure price fluctuation in payouts.**&#x20;\n   While we have tried to minimize the time between initiating and executing the payout transactions for the completed milestones, there have been instances where proposers have yet to receive the exact amount initially committed due to fluctuations in the value of COMP and transaction execution delays. To mitigate this issue, the CGP team will execute the payout transactions as soon as the milestone transaction has been initiated. We're also arranging a weekly time that works for the domain allocators, during which we will actively collaborate with the CGP lead.\n3. **Including the acceptance rationale for accepted proposals as part of the monthly reports**\n   In line with our commitment to transparency and community engagement, we have consistently provided monthly reports throughout the previous iteration. We will maintain this practice in the future to keep the community informed about the progress and developments within the Compound community. Furthermore, in response to feedback from several community members, we will introduce a dedicated section to provide additional insights into the rationale behind the acceptance of each proposal. By sharing the reasoning that led to the approval of specific proposals, we aim to offer the Compound community greater visibility and understanding of the decision-making process. The rationale for acceptance/rejection of each proposal is available on Questbook.&#x20;\n4. **PGov as the domain allocator for DAO expenses.**\n   After thoughtful discussions and evaluation of proposals, we are pleased to announce that we have invited @PGov to serve as the Domain Allocator for the DAO Expenses domain. @PGov has expressed interest, and @cylon, our current DA, is supportive of this change. Without this update, Michael (@cylon) would need to serve as the DA for two domains, which we believe could benefit from more focused attention.Also, PGov has had relevant experience in this domain:\n   \\- DeFi grants at Near and Aurora Protocols\n   \\- Optimism Grants Council\n   \\- Uniswap Accountability council (where he managed DAO expenses for working groups as well as made decisions on the deployment of UNI incentives for deployments)\n   \\- etc.\n5. **For proposals requesting greater than $25K up to $100K**\n   To ensure thorough evaluation, we propose implementing additional steps, such as requiring these projects to present their work to the broader community during a community developer call or through a forum post. This will allow for greater feedback and ensure that each case is carefully considered on its own merits. We believe this approach will encourage the development of larger, more complex infrastructure projects while maintaining transparency and community involvement.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe propose renewing the Compound grants program for the next iteration with a budget of $1.375 M for twelve months.\n\n\\- Extending the program to twelve months versus six will give the community enough time to evaluate the performance of the grants program, striking a better balance between managing program costs and meeting community expectations while allowing us to concentrate more on achieving better program outcomes. It also reduces the burden on voters by reducing the frequency of renewal votes from every five to every eleven months. It reduces the frequency of backlogging the waitlist when the program is active. Furthermore, since many grantees require several months to complete their projects, a longer program timeline would allow us to assess and showcase the program's impact on the Compound community more effectively.\n\n\\- Additionally, we suggest slight modifications to the program domains. Following detailed discussions with domain allocators and the community members, we've proposed merging the Dev Tooling domain with the New Ideas and Dapps domain due to the fewer applications received in the Dev Tooling domain. We also propose introducing a new domain named \"DAO Expenses.” This domain will cover reimbursements for documented expenses personally incurred by DAO members on behalf of the DAO, for example, gas fees, operational costs for off-chain infrastructure, and maintenance expenses for long-term grant projects. We've set aside $75,000 in the program budget for these DAO expenses.\n\nRFPs for each domain can be found here:&#x20;\n\n1. New Dapps and Ideas merged with Developer Tooling&#x20;\n2. Multi Chain and Cross-chain tooling&#x20;\n3. Security Tooling&#x20;\n4. DAO Expenses&#x20;\n\n### Specifications and Implementation\n\nWe continue running the grants program using the [<u>Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model</u>](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) with minor changes. Each \\*domain allocator\\* will run their domain on-chain using Questbook for full transparency. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community. Domain allocators can discretionally adjust funding amounts for KPI non-achievement.\n\nThe grant funds will be disbursed on-chain from a multi-signature wallet managed by the program manager and the domain allocator. The domain allocator will approve or reject applications based on an evaluation rubric. A Grants SAFE with a 3/5 multi-signature setup will be established, involving the program manager and four domain allocators. Additionally, four separate SAFEs, each with a 2/2 multi-signature between the program manager and a specific domain allocator, will be created for each domain. The grants program funds will be transferred from the treasury into the Grants SAFE, which will cover operational costs, committee compensation, and the grants budget. Funds allocated to the proposers will be held in the domain-level SAFEs.\n\nAfter 12 months, the grants committee and the Compound community shall evaluate the performance of each domain using publicly available data and decide to change the domain, the domain allocator, or the program manager. CGP closed viewing new proposals on May 31st. Upon approval of this proposal, the CGP grants team will evaluate the milestones and initiate payouts for the remaining milestones to the accepted proposals from the allocated budget. Funds left over will be transferred back to Compound’s contract.\n\n### KPIs and Expectations\n\n**Program Success**\n\n\\- Multiple relevant proposals and at least one funded project for each of Compound’s RFPs\n\n\\- Increase in milestone and proposal completion rates\n\n\\- Increase in NPS score from all proposers and grantees\n\n\\- Lower response turnaround time to delegates’ and community’s queries\n\n\\- Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, demographics, etc. We encourage the community members to review the proposals across different domains during community calls regularly\n\n\\- Timely publishing of a comprehensive monthly grants report outlining the status, progress, and impact of the program, ensuring transparency and accountability\n\n**Enhanced Community Involvement**\n\n\\- Increase in community engagement across:\n\n    - Discourse\n\n    - Discord, Telegram\n\n    - Social media (Twitter, Reddit)\n\n\\- Increase in the community members’ participation to keep domain allocators and program manager accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n\n**Brand Awareness**\n\n\\- Strengthened contributors’ sentiment and word of mouth towards Compound measured through frequent sentiment surveys/ polls to gauge satisfaction.\n\n\\- Enhanced Compound’s brand recognition and awareness within contributor circles through surveys or social media analytics, tracking mentions, reach, etc.\n\n**Contribution of Funded Projects to Compound**\n\n\\- Number of users onboarded by the funded proposals onto their app/protocol\n\n\\- TVL (if applicable) of the selected proposals\n\n\\- Number of projects supplying/borrowing on Compound\n\n\\- Number of new interfaces for supplying/borrowing/governance interactions\n\n\\- Number of projects that have raised follow-on capital after getting a grant from CGP\n\n**Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities**\n\n\\- All Domain Allocators and the Program Manager will continue to uphold their designated responsibilities as outlined in the [<u>CGP proposal</u>](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/3352/1#:~:text=Domain%20Allocator%20Roles%20%26%20Responsibilities%3A)\n\n\\- Domain allocators may request an audit for the considered/accepted proposals, particularly those that involve Solidity code being deployed into production and directly impacting Compound. To streamline the code auditing process and avoid potential time-consuming challenges, the domain allocators will assist with the considered/accepted proposals by offering code quality and design feedback.\n\n\\- Like previous CGP programs, the Program Manager will collaborate with the Compound Labs team and the elected domain allocators to maintain an updated list of RFPs to ensure alignment with Compound’s priorities and roadmap.\n\n### Product Improvements\n\nDuring the last iteration of CGP, we made the following enhancements to Questbook. Based on the feedback received from the Compound community members, proposers, and domain allocators, we will continue to improve. \n\n1. Status of each proposal on Questbook: Community members can now view the status (complete, in-progress, or inactive) of every grant proposal accepted in the current and previous iteration at [<u>https://compoundgrants.questbook.app/</u>](https://compoundgrants.questbook.app/)\n2. Adding images to the comments section on Questbook: All stakeholders can post images in the comments section while discussing the proposed proposal on [<u>Questbook</u>](https://questbook.app/)\n3. Edit and resubmit the existing proposal: All proposers can now edit and resubmit their updated proposals upon resubmit request from domain allocators without the need to submit an entirely new proposal under a different name.\n4. Tags for each milestone payout: Community members can now view tags indicating the payout for each milestone on [<u>Questbook</u>](https://questbook.app/) as soon as a milestone has been paid out.\n5. Dedicated CGP landing page: Community members can also view comprehensive details related to the current and previous iterations of CGP through a dedicated Compound Grants [<u>landing page</u>](https://compoundgrants.questbook.app/)\n6. Questbook Builder Profile: We are introducing a Questbook Builder Profile that will deeply connect to the builders’ credentials.\n\n### Budget Requested and Breakdown\n\nWe propose to renew CGP with a budget of $1.375 M for twelve months. This budget will be allocated as follows: \n\n1. New Dapps and Ideas: $800k\n2. Security Tooling Domain: $150k\n3. DAO Expenses Domain: $75k\n4. Multichain and Cross Chain Domain : $100k\n\nGrants budget that will be allocated: $1.125M\n\n**Program Manager & Domain Allocator Compensation**\n\nBased on what we learned from the last iteration of CGP, a program manager and domain allocator are expected to dedicate approximately 15 and 12 hours per week, respectively. However, the time commitments may vary depending on the number of proposals received for a domain and the nature of the domain. Moreover, the domain allocators may exceed or work less than the hours committed per week based on the proposal volumes. We propose that the hourly price be the same for the Domain Allocators and the Program Manager, as in the case of the last iteration of CGP.&#x20;\n\nNote: \n\n1. The above figures ([forums](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-grants-program-renewal/5595/19)) are calculated based on the assumption of 48 working weeks in a year. \n2. Questbook will provide the grants committee its grants orchestration tool at a cost of $5000 per month.\n\n**About Questbook**\n\n* Questbook (YC-W21) is a decentralized grant orchestration tool currently being/previously used by Arbitrum, Solana, TON, Aleph Zero, ENS, Alchemix, Axelar, etc.\n* Considering CGP's achievements and the time commitment and operational expertise necessary for running an effective grants program, Questbook will continue as the Program Manager.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThe $1.375m will entirely in COMP.\n\n* $1.375m COMP @ $41.50 => 33133 COMP",

Simulations have confirmed the market’s readiness, as much as possible, using the [Comet scenario suite](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/tree/main/scenario). The new parameters include setting the risk parameters based off of the [recommendations from Gauntlet](https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-wsteth-market-on-mainnet/5504/4).\n\nFurther detailed information can be found on the corresponding [proposal pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/911), [deploy market GitHub action run](https://github.com/woof-software/comet/actions/runs/10717773287) and [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-wsteth-market-on-mainnet/5504).\n\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThe first proposal action sets the CometFactory for the new Comet instance in the existing Configurator.\n\nThe second action configures the Comet instance in the Configurator.\n\nThe third action deploys an instance of the newly configured factory and upgrades the Comet instance to use that implementation.\n\nThe fourth action configures the existing rewards contract for the newly deployed Comet instance.\n\nThe fifth action converts ether to wstETH and transfers it to the Comet to seed the reserves.\n\nThe sixth action updates the ENS TXT record `v3-official-markets` on `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`, updating the official markets JSON to include the new Ethereum Mainnet cwstETHv3 market.",

      "content": "## Background\nSince 2021, Gauntlet has worked with Compound to maximize the protocol’s capital efficiency given an acceptable level of market risk.\n\nFull details of the proposal can be found [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-compound-renewal-2024/5661).\n\n## Proposal\n\nA proposal to renew Gauntlet’s 12-month engagement with Compound on Risk Management, Yield Optimization, and Incentive Optimization. The scope of work includes continuous market risk management to maximize capital efficiency while minimizing the risk of insolvency and liquidations, aiming to create long-term sustainable growth. Incentive optimization aims to bootstrap liquidity, promote growth, and facilitate decentralized governance. Gauntlet renewed its partnership with Compound last year in September, which runs through September 27, 2024.\n\n## Compensation Structure\n\nThe service fee structure will be a fixed annual fee of $2,300,000 using the COMP spot price.\n\nA portion of our payment (30% of the $2.3M fee) will be transferred from Compound in a lump sum COMP transfer directly to Gauntlet. Gauntlet will refund the DAO up to 30% of our fee ($690K) in any event, as defined in the forum post.\n\nThe remaining 70% of the fee will be paid in USDC via the Vendor Payments Aera Vault, following the same process that the community has approved for [Open Zeppelin](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/261). This proposal deposits $2.2M of COMP into Aera and calls createStream on a Llama Pay Router, via the Compound Aera vault’s execute function. The stream will pay out on a per-second basis over a year. $1.61M USDC over 31536000 seconds gives a rate of 0.05105276509 USDC/sec. The additional buffer can be reclaimed by Compound governance at any time.\n\nGauntlet will be able to withdraw the vested funds at any time.\n\nMore details can be found in the [forum post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-compound-renewal-2024/5661).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

This proposal takes the governance steps recommended and necessary to update a Compound III WETH market on Base. Simulations have confirmed the market’s readiness, as much as possible, using the [Comet scenario suite](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/tree/main/scenario). The new parameters include setting the risk parameters based off of the [recommendations from Gauntlet](https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-rseth-as-collateral-on-arbitrum-and-wrseth-as-collateral-on-optimism-base-and-scroll/5445/5).\n\nFurther detailed information can be found on the corresponding [proposal pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/914) and [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-rseth-as-collateral-on-arbitrum-and-wrseth-as-collateral-on-optimism-base-and-scroll/5445).\n\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThe first proposal action adds wrsETH to the WETH Comet on Base. This sends the encoded `addAsset` and `deployAndUpgradeTo` calls across the bridge to the governance receiver on Base.",

      "title": "Finalize Delegate Race (Cycle 1)",
      "content": "## Summary:\n\nThe Compound Governance Support Working Group (GSWG)  introduced the DAO’s first delegate race in July to increase the robustness of the DAO’s delegate base. This onchian proposal is the final step for ratifying delegation to the 8 entities/individuals that received the highest number of points during the application process. If this proposal passes, 8 Franchiser contracts will be created by the already deployed and audited FranchiserFactory contract, ownership of the FranchiserFactory will be set to the timelock, and each individual Franchiser will allocate the appropriate amount of voting power to the delegates’ addresses. A total of 250k COMP will be delegated from the Comptroller to the elected delegates. This vote also includes 50k COMP in delegation to Alpha Growth since their team did not receive delegation from a previously passed proposal due to a lack of the stated Franchiser infrastructure. Hence, the total number of Franchisers will amount to 9, and the delegated COMP will amount to 300k.\n\n## Proposal Motivation:\n\nDespite Compound being one of the most prominent DeFi protocols, this stature unfortunately does not translate into active governance participation. Many top delegates with considerable voting power have less than 50% vote participation rate–and many even sit under 10%. In healthy governance environments, proactive delegates wield significant voting power, ensuring malicious votes are prevented and quorum requirements are met. This is especially vital for lending markets with a high degree of reliance on governance, requiring delegates to be consistently available, often voting on numerous proposals over the course of a single week. The recent governance attack also illustrated the importance of allocating more voting power to community-trusted delegates.\n\nMost DAOs have dormant native tokens present in their treasury. If these native tokens aren’t already being allocated to active initiatives, they can be put to good use elsewhere. There is minimal risk to setting aside a pocket of these dormant funds to ensure better governance participation in a manner where governance can recall the tokens back to the community treasury. The most straightforward means by which these tokens can be mobilized is by delegating a portion of them to either existing or new delegates.\n\nFor sourcing the votes, we can reference Compound’s [Comptroller](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d9819210a31b4961b30ef54be2aed79b9c9cd3b):\n\n\t- Address: 0x3d9819210A31b4961b30EF54bE2aeD79B9c9Cd3B\n\t- As of August 20, 2024 the address held 1,578,587.6 COMP tokens\n\t- Dormant capital from this address can be mobilized for delegation\n\nIt is important to establish a structure that will enable the DAO to sustain control and ownership of these funds, however. In other words, if the DAO would like to clawback funds at any point, either to use the tokens for alternative purposes, or to rescind a particular wallet’s voting power, it should be able to do so seamlessly. The advantage of this setup is that the DAO’s COMP tokens never leave the community’s control and can be relocated when needed at any time.\n\n## More details on the implementation:\n\nThis proposal will delegate voting power to the 8 applicants using the deployed [FranchiserFactory](https://etherscan.io/address/0xE696d89f4F378772f437F01FaaD70240abdf1854), which is responsible for creating Franchiser contracts. The Franchiser contracts have already been [audited by OpenZeppelin](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/event-horizon-franchiser-contract-audit/25738). Individual Franchiser contracts are used to delegate COMP tokens to noted addresses, and the FranchiserFactory has the ability to clawback the voting power if it decides. Ownership of the FranchiserFactory will be given to the Compound timelock, effectively enabling the DAO to give or take voting power from elected delegates. Hence, revoking voting power once it has been granted to the given addresses requires a typical onchain governance vote.\n\n## Delegate Race Outcome:\n\nThe GSWG created a [points system](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-delegate-race/5460) to decide how points would be given to delegates. This setup weighted heavily on a wallet’s voting participation rate–and also rewarded those who authored and sponsored previous proposals, as well as attended community calls. A week-long [application process](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-delegate-race-application/5521) followed, with 18 groups and individuals applying for delegation. Up to 50k COMP delegation for each applicant was given–unless that address hit 80k COMP in total delegation, at which point, the upper threshold for voting power was capped. This process was conducted until the 250l allocation was fully used. There was a tie breaker between four candidates, and votes were allocated based on which candidate had the oldest active delegate address.\n\nBelow are the final candidates, along with their assigned votes and voting addresses.\n\n\n### Candidate: PGov\n\t- Points Scored: 10\n\t- Assigned Votes: 34,450.00\n\t- Voting Power Final: 80,000.00\n\t- Address: 0x3FB19771947072629C8EEE7995a2eF23B72d4C8A\n\n### Candidate: Franklin DAO\n\t- Points Scored: 9\n\t- Assigned Votes: 9,999.76\n\t- Voting Power Final: 80,000.00\n\t- Address: 0x070341aA5Ed571f0FB2c4a5641409B1A46b4961b\n\n### Candidate: Arana Digital\n\t- Points Scored: 9\n\t- Assigned Votes: 50,000.00\n\t- Voting Power Final: 50,001.00\n\t- Address: 0x0579A616689f7ed748dC07692A3F150D44b0CA09\n\n### Candidate: Michigan Blockchain\n\t- Points Scored: 8\n\t- Assigned Votes: 29,999.88\n\t- Voting Power Final: 80,000.00\n\t- Address: 0x13BDaE8c5F0fC40231F0E6A4ad70196F59138548\n\n### Candidate: Allthecolors\n\t- Points Scored: 6\n\t- Assigned Votes: 44,371.81\n\t- Voting Power Final: 80,000.00\n\t- Address: 0x66cD62c6F8A4BB0Cd8720488BCBd1A6221B765F9\n\n### Candidate: Avantgarde Finance\n\t- Points Scored: 6\n\t- Assigned Votes: 29,999.85\n\t- Voting Power Final: 80,000.00\n\t- Address: 0xB49f8b8613bE240213C1827e2E576044fFEC7948\n\n### Candidate: Event Horizon\n\t- Points Scored: 6\n\t- Assigned Votes: 50,000.00\n\t- Voting Power Final: 54,588.74\n\t- Address: 0xb35659cbac913D5E4119F2Af47fD490A45e2c826\n\n### Candidate: Sharp\n\t- Points Scored: 6\n\t- Assigned Votes: 1,178.70\n\t- Voting Power Final: 1,190.67\n\t- Address: 0x72C58877ef744b86F6ef416a3bE26Ec19d587708",

      "title": "Add Proposal Guardian to Governor Bravo",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nWe propose to seek implementation of the community multisig to be used as a guardian for Compound Governance. The goal of this Proposal Guardian is to act as a last defense against any malicious governance votes in the future. Additionally, we propose a few future changes to the Compound Governor contract to be more robust in the future.\n\n## Proposal Guardian\n\nThe Proposal Guardian would initially consist of the Community Multi-sig ([0xbbf3f1421D886E9b2c5D716B5192aC998af2012c](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbbf3f1421D886E9b2c5D716B5192aC998af2012c)), a 4/8 multi-sig composed of trusted Compound DAO community members ([here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-multisig-4-of-6-deployment/134/18)) which has been functioning as the Pause Guardian for the majority of Compound’s existence. This Proposal Guardian role should only be able to veto a proposal that has passed a majority vote and is awaiting execution. We have established this set of rules for when the Proposal Guardian is able to choose to move forward with a veto:\n\n1. Users’ funds deposited into the protocol might be infringed or at risk by a proposal passing\n2. If a vote has been controlled by a single entity or a proposal will result in a single entity taking effective control of the DAO\n3. When necessary to coordinate pausing protocol functionality during urgent security emergencies to protect the protocol and user funds.\n4. Serious considerations will be made when votes having received at least 400K “NO” votes still pass.\n   Update: Based on community feedback, the Proposal Guardian role will automatically expire to ensure that the Community Multi-sig cannot use its veto power to remain in-place indefinitely. The initial expiration period will be set to 6 months and require another governance proposal to renew. The additional changes are currently underway and will be ready to share and include in the on-chain proposal and forum post by this Friday.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n@Arr00 has completed technical work and OpenZeppelin has reviewed the changes to implement the Guardian changes in [PR16](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance/pull/16). It introduces a new `proposalGuardian` role that can call the `cancel` function on any proposal and a `_setProposalGuardian` function to set the role. The PR also includes simulation tests to ensure the changes work as expected on-chain.\nPlease note that the [compound-governance repo](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance) being used as the base for this upgrade was previously [audited by OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance/blob/main/audit/OZ-Sept-23.pdf) as a new source for Compound governance with dedicated testing and coverage. It also introduces the ability to vote with reason and propose by signature.\n\n## Timeline\n\nGiven the nature and sensitivity of this proposal, we will be moving forward in an accelerated timeline. The proposal will be discussed on the Community Call this week on Aug 7th and shared privately with all major identified delegates to collect final feedback. The proposal will then be published on the forums and submitted on-chain Friday, Aug 9th so that voting can begin early next week.\n\n## Future\n\nA full “Constitution” regarding when to get involved in veto votes will be drafted in the near future. Coupled with a concurrent new delegate race to get more Compound delegated and active in governance to trusted members of the DAO, this should set a new foundation for a more secure and active Compound governance!\nAdditionally, we propose exploring additional changes to Compound Governance to improve security and coordination in the future:\n\n* Upgrade Compound Governor Bravo to use OpenZeppelin Governor that has more gas efficiency, security features and optional extensions. There is already a [CGP grant by ScopeLift](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0xeb047900b28a9f90f3c0e65768b23e7542a65163\\&chainId=10\\&proposalId=664b6f438d3dfee9013f4a38\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true) working on delivering this.\n* Late Quorum Voting Period: If last minute votes change the outcome of a vote, additional time will be added on to the voting period to allow for more delegates to review and finalize decisions. A [Late Qurum Prevention extension](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/extensions/GovernorPreventLateQuorum.sol) is already available in OpenZeppelin Governor.\n* Adaptable Voting Quorum: Quorum can increase based on the amount of delegated COMP once a proposal shifts from \"review --> voting\". If not technically feasible to automate on-chain, this could also be achieved by regularly adjusting the quorum threshold based on the current number of delegated COMP.\n* Delegation Rights for COMP Staking Product: Ensure that the [Compound Staking Product](https://www.comp.xyz/t/alphagrowth-stake-compound-product/5478?u=cylon) proposed by the Compound Growth Program preserves delegation rights and helps to further align COMP token holder incentives with responsible governance participation. This is already referenced as a requirement in the recent [Staked COMP Design forum post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/potential-design-of-staked-comp/5526).\n\n## Compound Governance Proposal Guardian Audit\n\nOpenZeppelin, in its role as Security Partner to the Compound DAO, audited the changes to include a Proposal Guardian into the Governance contracts proposed by @PGov and developed by @arr00.\n\n### Summary:\n\nAug 7th - Aug 9, 2024\nTotal Issues:   2 (1 resolved)\nNotes & Additional Information:   1 (1 resolved)\n\n### Scope\n\nWe audited the [compound-governance](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance) repository at [commit e3b36ad](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance/tree/e3b36ad5b4e23022921fa077d657182f9340b203) with a focus on the [differences](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance/compare/c96570375f6696baa576f760642d55ab28aa7340...e3b36ad5b4e23022921fa077d657182f9340b203) since our [last audit](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance/blob/e3b36ad5b4e23022921fa077d657182f9340b203/audit/OZ-Sept-23.pdf).\nAfter the initial report, we were asked to also audit the updates to the repository at commit [84dff8d](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance/tree/84dff8dca36052a4981793e86f000627c148bd12), introducing expiration for the `proposalGuardian`.\nIn scope were the following files:\n\n```\ncontracts\n├── GovernorBravoDelegate.sol\n└── GovernorBravoInterfaces.sol\n```\n\n### System Overview\n\nCompound Governance is the main protocol used by holders and delegates of COMP to govern Compound II and III. It gives them the power to propose, vote, and implement changes to both active Compound protocols. The governance system has control over several systems across the protocol such as each proxy, the `Configurator`, Comet factory, and `Comet`.\nWhen a proposal to update any system parameters succeeds, the `Timelock` will call all of the relevant methods on the `Configurator` contract. For Compound III this process is followed by invoking the `deployAndUpgradeTo` method on the `CometProxyAdmin` contract, which then points to the new implementation upon execution.\nIn this audit, we focused on the new role of the `proposalGuardian` and the modifications made to the logic of the `cancel` function. The holder of this role will be allowed to cancel any proposal as if they were the proposer themselves. Apart from this update, no other no other significant alterations were made to the `cancel` function that would impact its execution.\nIn the second part of the audit, our focus remained on the `proposalGuardian` role, specifically examining the new logic introduced in the `_setProposalGuardian` function. This modification allows the guardian’s role to have an expiration, enabling a time-limited tenure for this position.\n\n### Security Model and Trust Assumptions\n\nThe addition of a `proposalGuardian` with the power to cancel any proposal that has not yet been executed introduces important security considerations and trust assumptions that must be addressed to maintain the integrity of Compound's governance. To prevent misuse of this veto power and ensure the robustness of the protocol, the `proposalGuardian` must be a trusted entity without centralized control.\nIt is assumed that the `proposalGuardian` will be a reputable and accountable entity managed by a multisig of trusted community members, to distribute veto power and reduce the risk of malicious actions, such as canceling proposals beneficial to Compound, not vetoing dangerous proposals for the protocol, or vetoing proposals to change the `proposalGuardian`. Ensuring the `proposalGuardian` is correctly configured during deployment, regularly monitored, and assigned a strict expiration is crucial for maintaining its effectiveness.\nActive community engagement and oversight are essential to ensure that the `proposalGuardian` aligns with the DAO's goals and acts in the community's best interests. This engagement allows the community to flag any misuse of power, enabling the DAO to propose replacing the `proposalGuardian` if necessary. It is worth noting that proposals to transfer the role to another account, while the current role is still active, can be vetoed by the current `proposalGuardian`.\n\n<div style=\"page-break-after: always\" />\n\n### Low Severity\n\n#### `_setProposalGuardian` Should Limit the Expiry\n\nCurrently [`_setProposalGuardian`](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance/blob/84dff8dca36052a4981793e86f000627c148bd12/contracts/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L768-L784) has no restrictions on how long a `proposalGuardian` can hold their role. If `proposalGuardian` were to ever be compromised and can hold the role for the next 2 years, they would be able to veto all proposals until those 2 years are up. Although `_setProposalGuardian` is set by governance and to a trusted multisig, we believe it would be more secure validating the expiry to be within reasonable limits, including that the `expiration` is in the future.\nConsider adding a restriction to `_setProposalGuardian` that would check that `newProposalGuardian.expiration` is in the future and within reasonable limits, for example less than or equal to 6 months.\n***Update:** Acknowledged, not resolved. @cylon stated:*\n\n> This is a reasonable change but given the time sensitivity of getting this upgrade completed, I think its better to proceed without addressing it. The proposal performing this upgrade will be setting the initial timestamp expiry and can be scrutinized by governance to ensure it is no longer than 6 months and is set in the future. This issue can then be addressed in the code itself by the upgrade to OpenZeppelin Governor by the ScopeLift team.\n\n### Notes & Additional Information\n\n#### Incomplete Function Documentation and Comments\n\nThe function [`cancel`](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance/blob/e3b36ad5b4e23022921fa077d657182f9340b203/contracts/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L370-L410) has been updated to allow cancellation of yet-to-be-executed proposals under the following conditions:\n\n* the sender is the `proposal.proposer`\n* the sender is the `proposalGuardian`\n* the `proposal.proposer` is not whitelisted and the proposer votes are below the `proposalThreshold`\n* the `proposal.proposer` is whitelisted, the proposer votes are below the `proposalThreshold` and the sender is the `whitelistGuardian`\n  However, the function's `notice` docstring, as well as the inline comments, are not updated to reflect the introduction of a `proposalGuardian`.\n  We recommend the following updates:\n\n1. `notice` docstring: Updated the `notice` docstring to include that the function cancels a proposal if the sender is the proposer or the `proposalGuardian`.\n2. [Line 382](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance//blob/e3b36ad5b4e23022921fa077d657182f9340b203/contracts/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L382-L382) Comment: Updated the comment on [line 382](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance//blob/e3b36ad5b4e23022921fa077d657182f9340b203/contracts/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L382-L382) to highlight that the `proposalGuardian` can cancel any proposal,\n3. [Line 389](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance//blob/e3b36ad5b4e23022921fa077d657182f9340b203/contracts/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L389-L389) Comment: Updated the comment on [line 389](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance//blob/e3b36ad5b4e23022921fa077d657182f9340b203/contracts/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L389-L389) to explicitly state that only the `whitelistGuardian` can cancel a proposal by a whitelisted proposer if it falls below the proposal threshold.\n   ***Update:** Resolved in* [commit 8340937](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-governance/blob/83409378e25d78dfb2cdbc98f8c97bdec166b173/contracts/GovernorBravoDelegate.sol#L374-L396)*.*\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe new addition of the proposal guardian to the Compound Governance contracts is minimally invasive and has been effectively implemented. However, this role carries substantial privileges, notably the ability to cancel proposals, including those that involve transferring the role itself to another account. Caution should be exercised in assigning this role and determining its duration. To bolster the long-term robustness and resilience of the protocol and to safeguard its decentralization, it is crucial to continue exploring more long-term solutions.\n\n### [Forum Post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-governance-proposal-guardian/5544)",

After our analysis, Gauntlet recommends these collateral factor adjustments for each stated collateral asset in order to further deprecate the v2 market. We were not able to include all parameter changes with the limitations via the governor bravo contract so those changes will need to be added to another on-chain proposal.\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-v2-deprecation-phase-13-08-01-2024/5516)\n\n## Specification\nThe proposal updates the parameters using the _setCollateralFactor and _setReserveFactor method of the relevant cToken contracts.\n\n***By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.***",

      "content": "**Background:**\n\nChainPatrol is a Real-Time Security Platform that aims to detect, block and manage takedowns of active malicious threats targeting Compound Protocol, keeping the community and organization safe from bad actors.\n\nWebsite - [https://chainpatrol.io/\n](https://chainpatrol.io/)\nIntroduction to ChainPatrol - https://chainpatrol.notion.site/Introduction-to-ChainPatrol-8166ad5f4c634129a2350e229001878b\n\nRelated Forum Post - https://www.comp.xyz/t/alphagrowth-enhancing-security-and-trust-with-chainpatrol/5427\n\n**Service Description:**\n\nService Cost: ($3K USD/mo starting with a 1 month paid trial, with the goal to continue into a 1-Year Contract after a successful trial). We will be paid directly by AlphaGrowth from their Growth Program Budget.\n\nAs Compound continues to grow and scale, bad actors have an increasing incentive to target the community, organization, and staff members. Online threats vary in nature across each platform and ChainPatrol specializes in detecting, blocking, and taking down these active threats (impersonations, phishing links, wallet drainers).\n\nOur takedown service covers domains, social platforms, and app stores, with social takedowns spanning across X.com, Discord, Telegram, Reddit, Instagram, YouTube, LinkedIn, TikTok, Facebook, and decentralized social platforms. Additionally, ChainPatrol Reporting Bots (for Discord and Slack) facilitate easy reporting from your team and community. By partnering with ChainPatrol, Compound can ensure a secure, trusted environment for its users and stakeholders.\n\nWe have proven success with leading projects such as Arbitrum, zkSync, The Graph, Starknet, CoW Swap, Consensys,underscoring our capability to prevent the loss of community funds swiftly and effectively. ChainPatrol can block malicious domains in as little as 15 minutes across 20 leading crypto wallets, including Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, and Phantom.\n\n**Action Items/Next Steps**:\n\nOur aim for this snapshot vote is to get the support of the Compound Community to become a valued security partner that works closely with Compound to protect its community, users, and builders through all of the key roadmap events, mitigating the impact of these potential threats on community members.\n\nIn addition, voting “Yes” to this proposal, will also serve as permission from the Compound Community for ChainPatrol to act on the DAO’s behalf for the purpose of initiating takedowns of malicious content across all socials (see Addendums below. These are presented to the platforms we petition with takedown requests to prove we are authorized by the community to work on its behalf.)\n\n**Addendum 1 → Power of Attorney**\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeigfk3kptoci7uuk3njgddqqkbjyvlkpzro7f6nrxyjnxllamkxbvm)\n    \n**Addendum 2 → X.com Letter of Authorization**\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreididabdvsgttqm3ayhz63dxoavn5c6q5buzlrnnnwclv322ma5nim)\n    \n\nAdditional steps in the onboarding process will include:\n\n1. Gathering Trademarks Details\n\n2. Add all brand assets and URLs to the dashboard\n\n3. Add Social Profiles of key Compound Protocol Staff Members\n\n4. Add Discord or Slack Reporting Bot for the Community.\n\n5. Staff and community members will be able to both check and report suspected malicious assets, using the /check and /report commands\n\n**ChainPatrol looks forward to being a trusted security partner of Compound and its community!**\n\n**Thank you all for your consideration!**",

      "title": "Trust Setup for DAO investment into GoldCOMP",
      "content": "## Proposal Overview\n\nThe goldCOMP DeFi vault 1 created by the Golden Boys is an exciting new strategy designed to provide COMP holders yields on their COMP tokens. When a user places COMP into the goldCOMP vault, the depositor receives goldCOMP, a semi-liquid wrapped token representing their initial deposit. These goldCOMP tokens can be placed in a 99/1 Balancer pool 1, creating a passive income stream for COMP holders who plan to hold COMP for a long period of time. The depositor’s goldCOMP can be burnt to receive the initial COMP during regular withdrawal windows with no risk of slashing or penalty. GoldCOMP is an exciting investment opportunity for any COMP holder, aimed to enrich the Compound Finance ecosystem. The proposal seeks a one year investment of 499,000 COMP of Treasury funds into the Trust Setup vault described above, to generate interest on 5% of treasury’s non-interest bearing COMP holdings.\n\n## Proposal summary\n\nAfter careful consideration of the feedback received on the previous proposal 7 regarding multisig concerns, the Goldenboys have decided to create a “Trust Setup.” Contract deployed here: [TrustSetup](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb9259d9f2249eb7fb44140926bfd376b63c4925e#code) This framework defines a constrained set of actions that can only be executed with prior approval from Compound Governance through a process referred to as granting a “Phase”.\n\nLet us provide a detailed breakdown:\n\nWhat specific set of actions can the Goldenboys multisig initiate, and under what circumstances?\n\nThe multisig has the capability to execute the following actions:\n\n- Invest\n- Divest (including queuing a divestment and its completion)\n- Convert rewards into WETH\n- Update oracle fee (setter)\n\nBefore addressing the conditions under which each action can be triggered, it is important to note that the “Trust Setup” begins in a phase called NEUTRAL, during which the multisig does not possess any rights to initiate either investment or divestment.\n\nUnder what circumstances is a PHASE updated, and what are the implications of such an update?\n\nAs previously described, there are two actions that can only be enabled if Compound Governance grants the Goldenboys multisig the necessary permissions: invest and divest. This process will be executed through the Timelock and requires calling the grantPhase(uint8) function. Setting the argument to 1 will enable the multisig to invest, while setting the argument to 2 will enable it to divest. It is important to note that only the Compound Timelock has the absolute authority to change the PHASE.\n\nHow will the multisig safely handle each of the INVEST and DIVEST operations once the PHASE has been granted?\n\nThe “Trust Setup” is designed to ensure that the minOut for each action is protected by on-chain logic, thereby ensuring that trust is not solely dependent on the operational competence of the multisig but is also verifiable on-chain (see _ratioCompBpt(), _calcMinBpt(uint256) & _minCompOut(uint256). Furthermore, the architecture incorporates an additional slippage check to further safeguard these operations. This slippage check will be calculated off-chain by the Goldenboys multisig to prevent manipulation. Please refer to the following methods for further details: invest(uint256 _expectedMinBptOffchain) and commenceDivestment(uint256 _bptToDivest, uint256).\n\nHow are the rewards processed and to which destination are they sent?\n\nRewards are processed by the Goldenboys multisig, initially converting them into WETH. Subsequently, any bot can convert these WETH rewards into COMP tokens by referencing the COMP/WETH ratio provided by the Chainlink oracle. Upon completion of the swap, the resulting proceeds are sent atomically to the Comptroller, as hardcoded within the smart contract.\n\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\n1. Transfer 499,000 COMP to the Trust Setup contract\n2. Update the PHASE to allow the Goldenboys multisig to call invest(uint256) in the Trust Setup contract",

This sends the encoded `setFactory`, `setConfiguration` and `deployAndUpgradeTo` calls across the bridge to the governance receiver on Optimism. It also calls `setRewardConfig` on the Optimism rewards contract, to establish Optimism’s bridged version of COMP as the reward token for the deployment and set the initial supply speed to be 4 COMP/day and borrow speed to be 3 COMP/day. The last two steps are to wrap ETH into WETH and transfer seed reserves into Comet\n\nThe third action updates the ENS TXT record `v3-official-markets` on `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`, updating the official markets JSON to include the new Optimism cWETHv3 market.",

      "title": "Trust Setup for DAO investment into GoldCOMP",
      "content": "## Proposal Overview\n\nThe goldCOMP DeFi vault 1 created by the Golden Boys is an exciting new strategy designed to provide COMP holders yields on their COMP tokens. When a user places COMP into the goldCOMP vault, the depositor receives goldCOMP, a semi-liquid wrapped token representing their initial deposit. These goldCOMP tokens can be placed in a 99/1 Balancer pool 1, creating a passive income stream for COMP holders who plan to hold COMP for a long period of time. The depositor’s goldCOMP can be burnt to receive the initial COMP during regular withdrawal windows with no risk of slashing or penalty. GoldCOMP is an exciting investment opportunity for any COMP holder, aimed to enrich the Compound Finance ecosystem.\nThe proposal seeks a one year investment of 92,000 COMP of Treasury funds into the Trust Setup vault described above, to generate interest on 5% of treasury’s non-interest bearing COMP holdings.\n\n## Proposal summary\n\nAfter careful consideration of the feedback received on the previous proposal 7 regarding multisig concerns, the Goldenboys have decided to create a “Trust Setup.” Contract deployed here: [TrustSetup](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb9259d9f2249eb7fb44140926bfd376b63c4925e#code)\nThis framework defines a constrained set of actions that can only be executed with prior approval from Compound Governance through a process referred to as granting a “Phase”.\n\nLet us provide a detailed breakdown:\n\nWhat specific set of actions can the Goldenboys multisig initiate, and under what circumstances? \n\nThe multisig has the capability to execute the following actions:\n- Invest \n- Divest (including queuing a divestment and its completion) \n- Convert rewards into WETH \n- Update oracle fee (setter)\n\n Before addressing the conditions under which each action can be triggered, it is important to note that the “Trust Setup” begins in a phase called NEUTRAL, during which the multisig does not possess any rights to initiate either investment or divestment.\n\nUnder what circumstances is a PHASE updated, and what are the implications of such an update? \n\nAs previously described, there are two actions that can only be enabled if Compound Governance grants the Goldenboys multisig the necessary permissions: invest and divest.\nThis process will be executed through the Timelock and requires calling the grantPhase(uint8) function. Setting the argument to 1 will enable the multisig to invest, while setting the argument to 2 will enable it to divest.\nIt is important to note that only the Compound Timelock has the absolute authority to change the PHASE.\n\nHow will the multisig safely handle each of the INVEST and DIVEST operations once the PHASE has been granted?\n\nThe “Trust Setup” is designed to ensure that the minOut for each action is protected by on-chain logic, thereby ensuring that trust is not solely dependent on the operational competence of the multisig but is also verifiable on-chain (see _ratioCompBpt(), _calcMinBpt(uint256) & _minCompOut(uint256). Furthermore, the architecture incorporates an additional slippage check to further safeguard these operations. This slippage check will be calculated off-chain by the Goldenboys multisig to prevent manipulation. Please refer to the following methods for further details: invest(uint256 _expectedMinBptOffchain) and commenceDivestment(uint256 _bptToDivest, uint256).\n\nHow are the rewards processed and to which destination are they sent?\n\nRewards are processed by the Goldenboys multisig, initially converting them into WETH. Subsequently, any bot can convert these WETH rewards into COMP tokens by referencing the COMP/WETH ratio provided by the Chainlink oracle. Upon completion of the swap, the resulting proceeds are sent atomically to the Comptroller, as hardcoded within the smart contract.\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\n1. Transfer COMP to the Trust Setup contract\n2. Update the PHASE to allow the Goldenboys multisig to call `invest(uint256)` in the Trust Setup contract ",

      "content": "After many in-depth discussions with other delegates and collecting community feedback, we have decided to move forward on implementing a hybrid exchange rate oracle for pricing Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) that optimizes security and scalability.\n\nWe’re thrilled that the Chainlink Labs team proposed an implementation for this oracle design, and we actively sought feedback from Gauntlet. The high-level overview of the proposed implementation is a Chainlink decentralized oracle network (DON) that would track the amount of underlying collateral backing an LST, which is the amount of ETH actively staked on the beacon chain. For increased security assurances for the Compound protocol, the results from the DON could be combined with comparison check conditions against the LST issuer’s on-chain calculated primary exchange rates and/or secondary market rates. Note that this design is subject to change based on feedback from Compound service providers.\n\nGauntlet has proposed deploying exchange rate pricing oracles across the various current LST/LRT markets while the hybrid exchange rate oracle is still under development. This approach aims to support the growth of Compound's TVL and revenue by enabling wstETH as collateral sooner and protecting other markets from the downsides of market price-dependent risks. Once the hybrid oracle development and audits are complete, the plan would be to transition to the new oracles.",

This proposal takes the governance steps recommended and necessary to initialize a Compound III USDT market on Polygon; upon execution, cUSDTv3 will be ready for use.

The new parameters include setting the risk parameters based on the [recommendations from Gauntlet](https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-market-usdt-on-polygon/5190/3).\n\nFurther detailed information can be found on the corresponding [proposal pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/858), [market deployment action](https://github.com/woof-software/comet/actions/runs/9627561011) and [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-market-usdt-on-polygon/5190).\n\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThe first proposal action sets the Comet configuration and deploys a new Comet implementation on Polygon. This sends the encoded `setFactory`, `setConfiguration` and `deployAndUpgradeTo` calls across the bridge to the governance receiver on Polygon. It also calls `setRewardConfig` on the Polygon rewards contract, to establish Polygon’s bridged version of COMP as the reward token for the deployment and set the initial supply speed to be 8 COMP/day and borrow speed to be 4 COMP/day.\n\nThe second action reduces Compound [cUSDT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf650c3d88d12db855b8bf7d11be6c55a4e07dcc9) reserves to Timelock, in order to seed the market reserves through the Polygon RootChainManager.\n\nThe third action approves Polygon’s [RootChainManager](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA0c68C638235ee32657e8f720a23ceC1bFc77C77) to take Timelock's USDT, in order to seed the reserves through the bridge.\n\nThe fourth action deposits 10K USDT from mainnet to the Polygon RootChainManager contract to bridge to Comet.\n\nThe fifth action updates the ENS TXT record `v3-official-markets` on `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`, updating the official markets JSON to include the new Polygon cUSDTv3 market.",

      "content": "## Background \nStarting on Dec 21st, 2021, OpenZeppelin was [selected](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/76) to offer the Compound DAO security services including continuous audit, security advisory, and monitoring. In the past, OpenZeppelin has created a proposal every quarter to perform the next service fee payment of $1M in COMP. \n\nWith the adoption of [Proposal 249](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/249), there is now a standard payment process for all Compound DAO service vendors utilizing payment streams in USDC. This new process is intended to reduce governance overhead for voters and streamline the process of paying all DAO service vendors, starting with OpenZeppelin.\n\nBy utilizing the new vendor payment process, OpenZeppelin will move to a yearly renewal model for our Security Partnership. As such, this proposal will initiate a payment of $4M in USDC to be streamed over the course of a year starting at the beginning of Q3 2024. \n\n## Compensation Structure \nThis proposal calls `createStream` on a Llama Pay Router, via the Compound Aera vault's `execute` function. The stream will pay out on a per second basis over a year. $4M USDC over 31536000 seconds gives a rate of 0.12683916793 USDC/sec. \n\nOpenZeppelin will be able to withdraw the vested funds at any time.\n\nThe funds are already in the vault as USDC, so no other transfer of funds is needed.\n\nMore detail in this [forum post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/openzeppelin-security-updates-for-q2-2024-yearly-renewal-compensation-proposal/5343).\n \nBy approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by OpenZeppelin shall be governed by the [Terms of Service](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eDcvirf0bdzpjIkfxQHm7fcV05O1IcLXL-Dl-U52Y4k) that were updated as of Sep 19th, 2023.",

      "content": "## Proposal summary\n\nCompound Growth Program [AlphaGrowth] proposes deployment of Compound III to the Arbitrum network. This proposal takes the governance steps recommended and necessary to initialize a Compound III WETH market on Arbitrum; upon execution, cWETHv3 will be ready for use. Simulations have confirmed the market’s readiness, as much as possible, using the [Comet scenario suite](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/tree/main/scenario). The new parameters include setting the risk parameters based off of the [recommendations from Gauntlet](https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-eth-market-on-arbitrum/5252/2).\n\nFurther detailed information can be found on the corresponding [proposal pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/860), [deploy market GitHub action run](https://github.com/woof-software/comet/actions/runs/9419069237/job/25948008428) and [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-eth-market-on-arbitrum/5252).\n\nThe market migration to create a new WETH Comet market on Arbitrum also includes a new collateral asset weETH which has not been used in any other Compound market previously. In prior analysis of weETH as a collateral asset, Gauntlet identified oracle risks which [could expose the protocol to exaggerated market movements](https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-weeth-market-on-ethereum/5179/3#oracle-risk-7) and a yield risk which could [cause yield shocks and consequentially elevate slippage magnitude and liquidity on DEXs](https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-weeth-market-on-ethereum/5179/3#yield-risk-8).\n\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThe first proposal action sets the Comet configuration and deploys a new Comet implementation on Arbitrum. This sends the encoded `setFactory`, `setConfiguration`, `deployAndUpgradeTo` calls across the bridge to the governance receiver on Arbitrum. It also calls `setRewardConfig` on the Arbitrum rewards contract, to establish Artitrum’s bridged version of COMP as the reward token for the deployment and set the initial supply speed to be 6 COMP/day and borrow speed to be 4 COMP/day.\n\nThe second action wraps ETH as WETH so it can be then transferred.\n\nThe third action approves (ArbitrumL1GatewayRouter) [TokenMessenger](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef) to take the Timelock's WETH on Mainnet, in order to seed the market reserves through the arbitrumL1GatewayRouter.\n\nThe fourth action bridges WETH from mainnet via ‘outboundTransfer’ function on ArbitrumL1GatewayRouter’s contract to mint native WETH to Comet on Arbitrum.\n\nThe fifth action updates the ENS TXT record `v3-official-markets` on `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`, updating the official markets JSON to include the new Arbitrum cWETHv3 market.\n",

      "content": "# Establish the Compound Governance Support Working Group (GSWG)\n\n## **Co-authors: StableLab @Doo\\_StableLab, Arana Digital @AranaDigital, & PGov @PGov**\n\n# Overview\n\nStrong and resilient governance is crucial to Compound’s growth and security. After examining the Compound governance [<u>starting last week</u>](https://www.comp.xyz/t/suggestions-for-the-creation-of-governance-support-working-group/5255/2?u=doo_stablelab), in response to recent governance challenges and the evolving needs of the Compound governance system, this proposal establishes a working group tasked with:\n\n* Strengthening the governance framework by enhancing the quality and quantity of participation; \n* Improving efficiency (e.g. recent quorum challenges); and,\n* Safeguarding against malicious proposals.\n\nAdditionally, this proposal will outline prospective measures of accountability, inter-DAO collaboration, and robust growth tracking. The GSWG will substantiate on the details of these initiatives and run them by the rest of the DAO before their actual implementation; hence, one of the group’s mandates is ideating and overseeing potential projects to achieve the above stated tasks. \n\nWe believe that these initiatives are imperative for the longevity of the DAO, and by extension the protocol itself, especially when competitors like Aave have captured a large amount of the borrow/lend market. The sector has also seen the emergence of multiple new entrants, like Ajna and Morpho, testing out the isolated money market structure. Unlike these new primitives, Compound’s architecture makes the DAO central to the success of the protocol–it should therefore be reinvigorated and effectively cultivated. This proposal, in concert with recent initiatives like Alpha Growth’s [<u>Compound Growth Program</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/compound/proposal/251) proposal, are a step in the right direction.\n\n# Mandates\n\nThe Compound GSWG will execute the following mandates:\n\n## Review Governance Status\n\n* Initial: Prepare Governance Status Reports (GSR); gather feedback from community and governance stakeholders. \n* Ongoing: Quarterly GSR updates incorporating new data and feedback; recommend new strategies based on findings.\n\n## Increase Governance Participation\n\n* Initial: Develop and launch a campaign to encourage delegation and increase participation for current and new delegates. \n* Ongoing: Updates, incentives, and metrics-based strategy adjustments to maintain and grow active governance participants.\n\n## Enhance Quality of Governance Participation\n\n* Initial: Identify methods to increase high-quality participation in Compound governance such as encouraging delegates to provide constructive feedback on proposals.\n* Ongoing: Provide recommendations for fine-tuning toward efficacy and inclusivity.\n\n## Ensure Quorum Achievement\n\n* Initial: Identify barriers to achieving quorum and develop strategies to ensure sufficient participation to prevent reruns.\n* Ongoing: Dynamically engage delegates to improve consistent voting activity.\n\n## Protect Against Malicious Proposals\n\n* Initial: Ensure delegates review proposals to prevent malicious proposals from passing and maintain a quorum level that helps secure the DAO. \n* Ongoing: Identify new threats and vulnerabilities while providing recommendations on improving the efficiency, resilience, and scalability of the Compound governance system.\n\n# Composition\n\nThe GSWG will consist of three members to ensure a diversity of perspectives while maintaining operational efficiency. The GSWG will be renewed on a 6-month basis. To cover funding and operational expenses, a base stipend of $4,000/month/member ($72,000/6 months) will be provided along with $1,500/mo ($9,000/6 months) to a multisig held by the working group. In addition, $50,000 will be allocated to be used for research and data tools and services if needed. In total, the proposal seeks $131,000 in USDC.\n\n## Members\n\n**StableLab**\n\n* ***About:*** StableLab is a governance firm focused on professional delegation, DAO framework design, and product development. StableLab works with various projects, from the ones just starting their journey to decentralization to the most prominent DeFi protocols.

They have been active in assessing risk recommendations from teams like Gauntlet (examples [<u>here</u>](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-arbitrum-usdc-reward-recommendations/4571/2) and [<u>here</u>](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-market-update-ethereum-usdc-7-21-23/4507/2)). Their team aided in [<u>initializing markets for new deployment like Scroll</u>](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/233). Arana has also helped sponsor proposals like [<u>adding rETH as Collateral to WETHv3 on Mainnet</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/compound/proposal/192) & one of the [<u>Compound V2 Deprecation</u>](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/compound/proposal/227) phases. \n\n**PGov**\n\n* **About:** PGov is a professional governance group focused on providing professional delegation services across various different defi protocols. They have been involved in the governance space for over three years and have experience across various blue chip L1 and L2 projects and chains. They have been active in Compound for over a year as a delegate and two years prior as a delegate, helping submit various votes and proposals over the months.\n* ***Contributions to Compound:** PGov’s team has been around in Compound for almost three years now. They have helped submit and propose various deployment proposals as well as community initiatives. Most recently, they’ve helped submit the deployment of initializing cUSDCv3 on Optimism and the current live Alphagrowth engagement initiative.*\n\n## Relevant Previous Initiatives by Members Across Other DAOs\n\n* Gnosis Quorum via Delegation by StableLab (proposed): [<u>https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-draft-establish-gnosisdao-delegate-program-v0/8578</u>](https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-draft-establish-gnosisdao-delegate-program-v0/8578) \n* Delegation of UNI to Active but Underrepresented Delegates by StableLab (in progress):\t[<u>https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-competition-of-delegation-of-uni-to-active-but-underrepresented-delegates/22319</u>](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/temperature-check-competition-of-delegation-of-uni-to-active-but-underrepresented-delegates/22319)\n\n<!---->\n\n* RRC-13: Delegation Incentives Program by StableLab (in progress):\t[<u>https://forum.rari.foundation/t/rrc-13-delegation-incentives-program/1774</u>](https://forum.rari.foundation/t/rrc-13-delegation-incentives-program/1774)\n\n<!---->\n\n* Findings from Uniswap Delegate Reward Working Group:<u>  </u>[<u>https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702</u>](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/findings-from-uniswap-delegate-reward-working-group/23702)\n\n<!---->\n\n* Uniswap Treasury Working Group by StableLab and Arana Digital (in progress): [<u>https://gov.uniswap.org/t/mobilizing-the-uniswap-treasury/23397</u>](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/mobilizing-the-uniswap-treasury/23397) \n* Aave gas rebates for onchain votes by Arana Digital members (co-authored): [<u>https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gas-fee-rebate-for-on-chain-votes/12559</u>](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-gas-fee-rebate-for-on-chain-votes/12559) \n* Private Voting for Onchain Aave Governance by Arana Digital members (co-authored): [<u>https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-private-voting-for-aave-governance-2-month-trial/12730</u>](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-private-voting-for-aave-governance-2-month-trial/12730) \n* Reducing the Uniswap Onchain Proposal Threshold by Arana Digital (co-authored): [<u>https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-lower-onchain-proposal-threshold/22429</u>](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-lower-onchain-proposal-threshold/22429) \n* Making the Uni v3 Deployment Process More Efficient by Arana Digital & PGov: [<u>https://gov.uniswap.org/t/update-uni-v3-v2-deployment-process-march-2024/23468</u>](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/update-uni-v3-v2-deployment-process-march-2024/23468) \n\n# Example GWSG Initiatives\n\nThe GWSG seeks to engage with the Compound community on potential reward-based initiatives to increase meaningful governance participation. \n\nExamples: \n\n* Reward the delegate(s) attracting the most new voting power via delegation each month\n* Balanced scorecard approach to rewarding delegates, ensuring transparency (e.g. voting, proposition, discussion participation, service positions)\n* Delegate Race to encourage delegations and sign up of new delegates\n* Prize pools for active voters (e.g. 1-vote=1-entry or voting power weighted entry; automatic/monthly via PoolTogether lottery)\n\nWe encourage the community to engage in this process, as any rewarded initiatives must be approved in a future proposal following further research and stakeholder interviews.\n\n# Success Criteria\n\nThe below KPIs are meant to be assessed on a year-long time horizon. They will ensure that the group’s goals are measurable, aligned with Compound, and consistently enhance the overall governance framework. We enthusiastically welcome community feedback toward effective metrics.\n\n**Quorum Achievement Rate:** Ensure that >95% of proposals achieve quorum to prevent reruns.\n\n**Delegate Participation Rate:** Increase the average participation rate for each proposal by 50%.\n\n**Delegate Diversity:** Increase the number of new delegates over 1,000 COMP by 25%. \n\n**Delegate and Delegator Satisfaction Rates:** Increase the relative satisfaction levels among both Compound delegates and delegators of voting power increased by at least 25% via surveys. This will be benchmarked against a survey that we initially run at the start of the program.",

      "title": "Compound Growth Program: 12 Month Term",
      "content": "Forum Post for the 12 Month term of the Growth Program: <https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-growth-program-2024-renewal/5215>\n\n## TL; DR;\n\nAlphaGrowth proposes the renewal of the Compound Growth program for a tenure of 12 months. After a successful 4 month trial that saw compound launch on Optimism, phased rollout of USDT markets, a 1.8M ARB grant won by the Compound growth program (valued at $2M+ or 37,192 at the time of winning), a 150K OP grant (valued at $400,000 or 7,438 COMP at the time of winning), and additional wins outlined below. \n\nGoing forward the Growth program will assume greater responsibility within the community in expanding the Chains, markets, tokens and any third party integrations for the protocol. We aim to increase TVL by $500 Million and increase revenue for the Compound DAO by $10M in the coming year. For this the Growth program requires 75,246 COMP for 12 months, which includes\n\n* 40,200 COMP in program expenses (including Core BD activities, developer charges, chain-market launch ops, grant consultation,marketing planning and more)\n* 18,504 COMP in Marketing fund (to be returned if unutilized)\n* 18,504 COMP in Integrations fund (to be returned if unutilized)\n\n![](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/compound/proposal/2321266312052999647)**Wins:**\n\nThe trial phase of the growth program, which spanned from December 2023 to April 2024, was successful in achieving a number of key milestones that will define the growth of the protocol in the coming year. For reference we accomplished the following wins in the last 4 months\n\n* Launched Compound on OP network 2 weeks ago (currently $5MM TVL)\n\n![](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/compound/proposal/2321266312052999647)<img height=\"232\" width=\"557\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/5153d13d-fa92-4c0d-aed2-2feb1ff77a2a_original.png\" />\n\n* Secured $3M grant from Arbitrum for Compound\n* Kick started the process to launch USDT Markets on 4 existing chains\n* Currently upgrading the rewards contract to be able to distribute rewards simultaneously in multiple tokens\n* Marketing campaigns saw the following results:\n  * USDC on Arbitrum saw active users increase from 1.6K wallets to 14K wallets and user counts are still rising.![](https://static.tally.xyz/cf5ab00a-932f-4803-892b-a8a8421adbd4_original.png)\n    * [<u>Source</u>](https://risk.gauntlet.xyz/protocols/compound/markets/v3-arbitrum-usdc?fullscreen=market_health_timeseries_accounts)\n  * OP USDC market achieved 12000 active users in the second week of marketing the deployment. [<u>Source</u>](https://risk.gauntlet.xyz/protocols/compound/markets/v3-optimism-usdc?fullscreen=market_health_timeseries_accounts)![](https://static.tally.xyz/255446f1-ff07-4079-8d16-55836518a4d6_original.png)\n* The following new assets are in the process of being listed:\n  * LRTs: ezETH, weETH, rsETH\n  * LSTs: rETH, stETH, wstETH\n  * Native: USDC(Base), USDC(ARB), USDC(OP), USDC(Polygon)\n  * Proposed(Not Ready): gmBTC\n* Started Integrations:\n  * Sommelier Finance Vault → Automated position management \n  * Qi Dao Base Integration → PSM for Base [<u>Link </u>](https://www.comp.xyz/t/integration-of-compound-tokens-on-base-qidao/5080)\n  * BaseSwap [<u>Link</u>](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0xeb047900b28a9f90f3c0e65768b23e7542a65163\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=65f359051080cbb344b2a812\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true)\n* \\[PENDING] One $500K grant from an ETH L2\n* \\[PENDING] Two separate $5MM Bootstrap & $500K grants from two EVM L2s\n* \\[PENDING] Three $1M launch incentive grants from three ETH L2s\n\nThe trial phase of the growth program also presented opportunities for us to explore the strategies that work for Compound. We learned that some opportunities (like the following) take more time and effort.\n\n* V2 ▶️V3 migrations:\n* New Dapp integrations\n* Wallet integrations\n* Working with Institutional Custodians\n* Centralized exchange integration\n\n## Why Compound Growth?\n\nThe time to act is now, propelled by a combination of market, technology, and trending macro dynamics that uniquely position us to seize emerging opportunities. Currently, over eight blockchain networks have expressed interest, with three already committing verbally to provide $1 million each in incentives to support our launch. This surge in interest coincides with the need to deploy the ARB grant strategically, ensuring we capitalize on this moment of heightened engagement and potential growth.\n\nOn the technological front, we've broken new ground with the creation of a multi-token reward contract—a first of its kind, exclusively available today because of our innovation. This isn't just about having cutting-edge technology; it's about utilizing it effectively. Like a high-performance vehicle, it requires a skilled driver to navigate the path ahead, and we are uniquely equipped to steer this initiative towards success.\n\nMacro trends further underscore the urgency. Recently, Compound experienced a significant dip, losing $400 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) as cryptocurrency prices, including ETH and BTC, have fallen. To counteract this and bolster our platform, it’s crucial to diversify by adding new assets and expanding our markets. This will not only help recoup the lost TVL but also enhance the flexibility and options available to our token holders, making our ecosystem more resilient and adaptable to changing market conditions.\n\n## Priorities and Plan for Growth\n\n* **Total Value Locked (TVL) Expansion:** Aim to increase TVL by $500 million across new and existing markets.\n* **Treasury Growth:** Target generating $10 million in treasury growth for the DAO, ensuring the Growth program is cost-neutral.\n* **Market Development:** Launch 8-15 new markets, including USDT markets on all applicable chains, with a focus on high TVL opportunities.\n* **Chain Expansion:** Expand Compound to 4-6 additional blockchain networks, implementing quantitative criteria for chain selection.\n* **Strategic Partnerships:** Establish high-value, industry-first partnerships and continue leveraging incentives from collaborations.\n* **User Acquisition:** Significantly increase over 25,000 new users, leveraging successful campaigns and focusing on L2’s and new market launches solutions\n* **Infrastructure Expansions:** Evaluate reputable partnerships for key infrastructure such as bridges and oracles and collaborate with new partners as new opportunities arrive.\n\n### Growth methodology\n\n**Asset and Market Expansion**: During our initial trial period, a significant focus was on enhancing ways to grow and sustain Compound. This next phase aims to bolster our financial foundation while expanding our market presence strategically. We plan to launch between 8 to 15 new markets, with a particular emphasis on USDT markets, setting a standard for new market criteria to ensure each has the potential for at least $20 million in TVL. This approach not only drives growth but also assures that the benefits to the DAO outweigh the costs of the Growth program.\n\n**Chain Integration and User Growth:** We are set to push for expansion onto six more blockchain networks, making substantial inroads in Chain integration by setting precise, quantitative selection criteria. This method will help the community understand the advantages and challenges of each new deployment. Furthermore, our user acquisition strategy has already shown promising results, with significant increases in user numbers on platforms like Arbitrum. By continuing to focus on Layer 2 solutions and securing more partnerships with entities like Revolut and OKX DeFi, we aim to dramatically expand our user base and strengthen our market position.\n\nThrough these strategic initiatives, Compound is poised to not only expand its footprint but also to solidify its standing as a leader in the decentralized finance space, driving forward with confidence and innovative vigor.\n\n## Contribution & Why Our Team is Essential\n\n###\n\nCompound operates within a dynamic and complex ecosystem, characterized by its decentralized nature and reliance on multiple contributors. Maintaining both high-quality standards and timely engagement in such an environment requires obsession. Our behind-the-scenes conversations play a critical role in reinforcing Compound's reputation as a consistent and reputable platform that is now ready to get creative in working with emerging market players.\n\nOur team has spearheaded 15 key proposals and discussions during the trial phase of the Compound Growth Program, encompassing a range of topics from market expansions to contract upgrades. We our committed to driving Compound's governance forward.\n\nMoreover, our proactive approach in generating new ideas and executing spontaneous projects has generated positive feedback and enthusiastic engagement from the community. These initiatives not only demonstrate our ability to anticipate and react to market needs in real time. Fostering the ongoing evolution of the Compound ecosystem.\n\nOur business development team is unrivaled in the cryptocurrency space, comprising 14 dedicated professionals who span the entire spectrum of marketing, business development, and sales engineering. This allows us to identify new opportunities, close deals, and seamlessly integrate new partners, maintaining Compound's competitive edge. Managing over 400 groups within the Compound framework, our use of sophisticated CRM tools and data analytics enables us to monitor and adapt to the ecosystem's evolution effectively.\n\nWe are continually approached by other ecosystems seeking our expertise to expand their operations, which attests to our reputation and success in the field. The growth and sustainability of the Compound protocol have been significantly influenced by our contributions, and we are eager to continue this trajectory, preferring to enhance Compound's stature rather than shifting our focus to another entity.\n\nIn summary, our team not only contributes to but critically sustains the growth and innovation at Compound. Our 'secret sauce'—a combination of expert knowledge, strategic foresight, and comprehensive execution capabilities—sets us apart from the competition and is essential for the continued success and expansion of the Compound ecosystem.\n\n## Budget Request Breakdown\n\nOur budget ask is neatly segmented into nine essential components, each crafted to bolster various facets of Compound’s growth and operations. Let’s dive into the details:\n\n1. Operations\n   1. Strategy & Data Research\n   2. Protocol Expansion & Business Development\n   3. Development Fund\n   4. Marketing Operations\n   5. Grant Consultation\n2. Marketing Fund\n3. Integration Grants\n4. Governance Delegation\n5. Liquidity Support\n\n#### **Strategy & Operations**\n\nThe service fee, at 3350 COMP/month, covers all costs associated with running our expansive program. This includes five critical areas of the growth program operations, which we've detailed below:\n\n* Scope 1: Strategy & Data Research: Tasked with uncovering new growth avenues, our team ensures the DAO is well-informed and ready to act on emerging opportunities.\n* Scope 2: Protocol Expansion Operations: We cover end-to-end deployment of chains, markets, and strategic integrations. Our previous successes, like the deployment on the Optimism network, highlight the intensive resources and effort involved, justifying the continuation and expansion of these efforts.\n* Scope 3: Development Fund: Our technical team is geared up to support the protocol expansion with dedicated coding resources, ensuring swift and efficient integration of new markets and chains.\n* Scope 4: Marketing Operations: Led by the former head of growth of the Near Foundation, our marketing team is set to supercharge Compound's visibility through targeted campaigns and influencer partnerships.\n* Scope 5: Grant Consultation: Securing grants for Compound from ecosystems and partners. We’ll handle everything from writing applications to distributing grant incentives on behalf of Compound. We will be good stewards of grants received on behalf of Compound. \n\n#### **Marketing Fund**\n\nOur marketing fund, allocated 1542 COMP/month, will drive demand through dynamic events highlighting new integrations and deployments within the Compound ecosystem. The recent surge in active users on the USDC Arbitrum market from 1.6K to over 8K exemplifies the impact of our strategic marketing efforts. The unused Marketing fund COMP will be returned to the treasury or carried over to the next term depending on the the DAO decision.\n\n#### **Integration Fund**\n\nThe integration fund we had in the trial phase proved to be extremely useful. Set at 1542 COMP/month, focuses on expediting development and funding strategic initiatives that enhance Compound’s infrastructure and capabilities.  To build up on this, we are now solidifying the requirement for an Integrations fund that will fund strategic initiatives that otherwise would not be funded due to multiple limitations. (like CGP ceiling of $30K for Grants). For majority of integrations, we will rely on CGP for funding partners. Additionally, if the COMP in the integration fund remains unused, it will be returned to the treasury by the end of the 12 month term or carried forward to the subsequent term depending on the DAO.\n\n#### **Governance Delegation** \n\nTo influence governance effectively, we are seeking a 50,000 COMP delegation, representing a quarter of the votes necessary for decision-making in proposals. Note: The governance delegation request is non-executable for this proposal. We will create a separate proposal for requesting delegation, this section is to inform users.\n\n#### **Liquidity Support**\n\nWe aim to get COMP listed as a collateral asset and enhance market functionality. To do this requires reaching $15MM in COMP and $15MM in counterparty token on a dex listing. We don’t know if we’ll have to supply all of the liquidity to reach $15M or if this is a zero to one problem and once a pool is created liquidity will flow in organically. To reduce risk we would like to create a COMP pool on one chain and bootstrap the first 10,000 COMP from the treasury as bootstrapped liquidity to overcome the zero to one problem of pool creation. We will learn from the outcome the best path forward to getting COMP listed as collateral. These initiatives are designed to deepen on-chain liquidity and reduce slippage, crucial for efficient COMP to USDC swaps.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/2d7b86bf-e1da-4850-bc9a-021c784e3bf5_original.png)\n\nThrough these structured funding requests, we aim to propel Compound into a future marked by robust growth, innovative expansion, and enhanced governance participation—all while ensuring the protocol remains a leader in the DeFi space.\n\n## Operational Process\n\n### TL; DR;  \n\nAs a business development, marketing & sales engineering organization, AlphaGrowth will continue to use the following processes and approaches to accelerate execution while working on deals involving a dozen or more stakeholders. \n\nOur base operational practices remain the same whether we are listing a new Token, Market, or Chain, each initiative has special considerations and additions to our base process. For example here is the process we’ve identified for listing Compound on a new chain <[<u>Link</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GPQYis8s_cAxvy43GOFgeXESg6VahLyVDWwMRVQ2QRE/edit#heading=h.ycec3ktzsbks)>, it involves 71 steps, 9 approval phases, and 8 organizations. Our ability to turn decentralized communities into discrete manageable processes, is what allows us to scale. \n\n## Operation Process Table of Contents\n\n1. TL; DR;  \n2. Table of Contents\n3. Our base operational process\n4. Special Considerations\n5. Marketing\n6. Software Development\n7. Appropriate Use of Funds\n8. Impact & Transparency\n\n### Base Process\n\n**Market Research**\n\nWhether launching a new chain, asset or market. Every opportunity AlphaGrowth pursues for Compound starts with extensive **market research**: Our team leverages our internal insights platform with its over 31 million on-and-off-chain data points, 108+ connected chains, and real time data ingestion & processing. Using real-time market data we identify the best potential integrations for Compound. We’ve currently tracking:\n\n1. 58,224 token projects\n2. Our network with close ties to 5,545 Dapp partners\n3. Hundreds of DEXs of which we have close relationships with 18.\n4. 50+ EVM based chains suitable for a Compound Integration\n\nWe scan for partners with deep liquidity, healthy metrics and a positive attitude toward Compound for potential collaboration. \n\n**Risk Analysis**\n\nNext we perform integration risk checks for target partners, and collaborate with risk analytics partners to identify all variables associated with adding the partner to the Compound ecosystem. \n\n**Outbounds**\n\nOnce the research and risk analytics phases are concluded, the real fun begins. Our team reaches out to shortlisted partners, pushing narrative and advocating for the partner to get involved with Compound. \n\n**Sales Engineering**\n\nAlphaGrowth works closely with both the prospective blockchains, token projects and the integration teams to analyze the viability of integration. AlphaGrowth tracks technical infrastructure requirements to be able to launch new chains, tokens & markets with Compound. We identify any blockers and architect solutions that will be carried out by our developers if the partnership advances. \n\n**Negotiation**\n\nIf a 3rd party ecosystem, treasury or dapp are involved, AlphaGrowth negotiates with the 3rd party to ensure the partnership’s success. For example, we ensure partners: \n\n1. Bootstrap pool launches by supplying sufficient Protocol Owed Liquidity.\n2. List their tokens in a timely manner and according to Compounds marketing schedule.\n3. Align incentives for win-win-win integrations. \n\n**Integration & Marketing**\n\nAlphaGrowth then collaborates closely with the teams of selected projects to ensure integration and deployment is on track. We also ensure adequate co-marketing campaigns are run with the integrating team to spread awareness for the integration\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nEach potential integration has a unique set of criteria that must be met for the opportunity to be considered a positive addition to the compound ecosystem. For Chains we target ecosystems whose goals are aligned with Compound’s and will work in the best interest of Compound to increase TVL, utility and revenue. For Tokens, we look for deep liquidity, healthy metrics and a positive attitude toward Compound for potential collaboration. For partnerships to increase TVL, we look for DeFi platforms with meaningful TVL generating potential through their existing audience and that audience’s interest in taking advantage of the opportunities Compound provides. \n\nEach partnership is different and the hundreds of conversations we’ve had for compound (and input from Gauntlet and the community) help us steer toward the best ones. \n\n### Marketing\n\nApart from the core business development activities, AlphaGrowth will also engage in auxiliary growth and marketing efforts to forward Compound’s cause. These will include:\n\n### Targeted Advertising:\n\nAlphaGrowth works with the Blockchain Ads team. Blockchain Ads has a proven record in reaching the right people in a very targeted manner, providing personalized advertising, curated based on people's on-chain behavior. Such as their most recent campaign for the Compound Academy.Blockchain Ads enables user acquisition at scale, and the ability to get Compound’s offerings in front of the owners of high value wallets.\n\nHow Blockchain Ads performs Traffic Source Stacking.\n\n1. High incentives are advertised to make participation worthwhile for big bag hodlers\n2. Blockchain-Ads target crypto enthusiasts based on their on-chain activity. \n3. Ads link DIRECTLY to a well-designed quest on Layer3.\n4. Users who click are taken straight into an interactive experience, increasing the chance of conversion.\n\nWhy a smooth experience increases conversion and retention\n\n1. They reduce friction by directing ad traffic straight to take an action through a quest. The quest format gamifies onboarding while teaching users about Compound and its partners. Completing the quest then earns rewards, solidifying the users first positive experience.\n\n### Quests:\n\nLayer3 has been very successful creating a collection of quests and streaks aimed at acquiring, onboarding, engaging, and retaining users on Compound V3, together called ‘Compound Academy’.\n\nThe quests guide users through Compound V3, Compound Extensions, and Compound Governance. \n\nThe Compound Growth program will lean into this strategy as new chains and markets are launched.\n\n### Twitter AMAs: \n\nThe AlphaGrowth team will work closely with DeFi communities to organize AMAs featuring Compound Integrations. In cases where the Compound labs team is unavailable, either a vetted Compound community member or AlphaGrowth will speak on Compound’s behalf. \n\nMarket each new opportunity for users to participate with Compound. We use tools like Blockchain Ads to target users by their wallet addresses ensuring highly relevant content is delivered to traders with the highest chance of converting (based on their historic activities). \n\n### Software Development\n\nThe Development program has 4 main areas of focus: deployment of new markets, development of new features, protocol maintenance, and consulting.\n\nWoof Software will work in tandem with AlphaGrowth to advance Compound through the continuous development of new features, community initiatives, and markets, as well as protocol maintenance, and support of external developers who want to contribute to the Compound Protocol.\n\nDuring the previous 3 months, Woof Software has trained its team with in-depth details of the Compound Protocol codebase and on-chain proposals deployment. We’ve also established working relationships with Compound Labs, OpenZeppelin, and Gauntlet to build a quick and effective development flow. Currently, Woof Software receives its requirements from the community and Compound Growth Team (AlphaGrowth).\n\n**Current projects**\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/626e67e7-2190-4844-9f41-50ca761c568a_original.png)\n\n**Development Process**\n\nThe program aims to establish long-term processes that will benefit each party involved in the delivery of new features.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/b4f48ab9-3d71-41ee-8a6a-0e8c10aed3cc_original.png)\n\n**Focus areas**\n\n* **Deployment of new markets:** Deployment of new markets with different collaterals on new and existing chains\n* **Development of new features:** On-demand development of new features like [<u>Comet Rewards V2</u>](https://www.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0xeb047900b28a9f90f3c0e65768b23e7542a65163\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=65cce2693dc7ecb321240d83\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true).\n* **Consulting:** Developers may directly reach out to the Woof Software team, or ask questions in the Discord development chat [<u>\\[see example\\]</u>](https://discord.com/channels/402910780124561410/402912055448961034/1232636590208057375). \n* **Protocol Maintenance:** Development and updating of such infrastructure components as Compound.js, updating information on aggregators like DeFi Llama, refactoring of documentation, etc.\n\n**Communication**\n\n1. **Forum:** When we start working on a project we will post an outline with estimated timelines to the forum. We will update the forum thread after each step in the outline has been achieved - as well as in case of any changes. We will reply to any questions on the forum within 2 working days.\n2. **Community calls:** We will attend all Community Calls in Discord and provide transparent updates.\n3. **Monthly Forum updates:** We will post updates about all ongoing, delivered, and planned projects during the month.\\*\\*\\*\\* \n\n**Deliverables:** \n\n1. Deliverables will be open-sourced and stored in the Woof Software GitHub repository.\n2. Deliverables include \n   1. Forum Discussion\n   2. Documentation\n   3. Deployment if applicable\n   4. On-chain proposal \n   5. Post-deployment support\n\n### Appropriate Use of Funds\n\nFor funds allocated as marketing fund or integration fu; AlphaGrowth will conduct a Post-program audit to list out all the expenses incurred and activities associated with these categories. Any unspent funds assigned to these Categories will be returned back to the Compound Treasury at the end of the time period of the program. With the exception of the liquidity bootstrap loans which will stay in place until the Compound Community votes them returned to the treasury. \n\n### Impact and Transparency\n\nTo align incentives for AlphaGrowth to go above and beyond. At the end of this 12-month engagement, AlphaGrowth will propose a performance bonus to be voted on by the Compound Community.  This bonus will also be a signal for AlphaGrowth to proceed and take on further responsibility within the Compound ecosystem.\n\nAt AlphaGrowth, we like doing business in public. To keep the community informed on the progress and ensure transparency, AlphaGrowth will provide: \n\n* Monthly reports on the progress of BD activities (12 reports)\n* Quarterly Progress reports highlighting various deals in the pipeline, successful integrations, closed deals, and learnings (4 reports)\n* A database that gives all the program-specific information to the community so that the members can come, verify and inquire about the process.\n* Post-program analysis and report about spends on budget categories 3,4 & 5\n* We have kept track of the [<u>130+ calls</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kZyRXWNXU-CZF-USXsOIbSQR6SVtGV5RhbiaQWlmWqQ/edit#gid=1315745627) we’ve taken on Compound’s behalf and will make our call logs available upon request \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------\n\n## **Operational Launch Process - Adding Compound to a new Chain** \n\nHey Compound Community, we’ve identified the following process to streamline approval & execution when adding Compound to a new chain. Please let us know if there is anything missing that we should add. \n\n**For Inbound Chain Requests**\n\n* Provide an application where chains to apply\n* Review the form to make sure it was done correctly, provide feedback to the chain\n\n**For Outbound Chain Requests**\n\n* AlphaGrowth identifies target chains based on their histories, TVL, etc … \n* AlphaGrowth sells the chain on a potential collaboration with Compound, requesting incentives and responsive engineers.\n* AlphaGrowth works with the chain to answer an initial pass of questions to qualify their chain as a potential candidate. \n\n**Is this a viable business opportunity?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth provides the chain’s answers to Gauntlet\n* Gauntlet provides a soft Go-No-Go\n* AlphaGrowth provides the Chain a template to post their desire to work with Compound on the Forum from their organization’s account. \n* The community waits for Gauntlet to reply on the forum that they will start their independent analysis. \n* Gauntlet’s independent analysis usually takes 1-2 weeks\n* Gauntlet Approves or Denies. This is a FINAL decision, if Gauntlet denies the opportunity stops 🛑If Gauntlet approves the opportunity continues 🟢\n\n**Does the Chain have an Oracle?** \n\n* ChainLink supports the chain → Continue to Finding Builders 🟢\n* ChainLink does NOT support the chain\n  * Chainlink says “We will never support” → Opportunity Stops 🛑\n  * ChainLink is in the process of supporting this chain → Wait & Continue 🟢\n  * ChainLink will but wants to be paid. AlphaGrowth goes to the Chain and tells them they need to pay chainlink to build the integration.\n    * The chain is unwilling to pay → Opportunity Stops 🛑\n    * The chain will pay → Wait & Continue 🟢\n* Redstone is also vetted as an oracle and can be contacted\n\n**Who will build the Compound Integration?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth finds a team to build the new chain’s Compound Integration. \n* AlphaGrowth asks for a development timeline to hold them accountable.\n\n**Who will fund the builders?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth finds a team to fund building the Compound Integration.\n* First AlphaGrowth approaches the Compound Grants Program (Questbook). \n  * AlphaGrowth shares a high level proposal\n  * If Questbook soft approves, AlphaGrowth provides a template for the development team to post their plans on the questbook public forum. \n  * If Questbook approves the funding → 🟢continue\n* If Questbook refuses to pay, AlphaGrowth tells the chain to pay for themselves\n  * If the chain says yes → 🟢continue\n* If the Chain can’t fund it, AlphaGrowth may deploy our own grant funds. At this point we need a Really Good business reason to do so. → 🟢continue\n  * If AlphaGrowth won’t fund it the opportunity stops 🛑\n* When funding is secured, move to auditing the chain. \n\n**Is the chain secure?**\n\n* AlphaGrowth asks Open Zeppelin to Audit the Blockchain/Token and submits for consideration Gauntlet’s Approval, Funding Approval & Open Zeppelin’s Template Form\n  * Open Zeppelin Rejects the Blockchain → Opportunity Stops 🛑\n  * Open Zeppelin Approves → 🟢Continue\n* Audit Approvals Received \\[Open Zeppelin & Gauntlet]\n\n**How much initial liquidity can be provided?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth meets with the compound growth DAO to negotiate how much initial liquidity they can provide on the new chain. Topics include how much liquidity the chain itself is providing. Supplied liquidity is not spent, it still belongs to the treasury and has been placed to overcome the cold start problem for the new chain. \n  * Compound Growth DAO will supply sufficient Liquidity → 🟢continue\n  * Compound Growth DAO will NOT supply sufficient Liquidity → 🟡\n    * Is there sufficient liquidity elsewhere to continue forward? \n      * Yes → 🟢continue\n      * No → 🛑stop\n* Sufficient Initial Liquidity is committed to continue\n\n**How will the new chain be accessed?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth meets with Compound Labs, provides a report of the opportunity, and asks if Compound Labs will update the Compound frontend to include the new token when the integration launches. If the pool isn’t on the front end, it’s practically unusable.\n  * Yes → 🟢continue\n  * No → 🛑stop and wait for a yes and a firm timeline. \n\n**Will the community approve?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth asks a delegate to make an On-Chain Voting Post using the Chain’s original forum post (copy-paste)\n* The Delegate publishes the On-Chain voting post\n* AlphaGrowth comments on the Chain’s original forum post informing the community that there’s an on-chain vote with the link. **Very simple post:** Update: Approved by Gauntlet, Approved by Open Zeppelin, we’re starting an on chain vote. Here’s the link.\n* The on-chain voting takes 3 days\n  * The vote fails → 🛑stop\n  * The vote Passes → 🟢continue\n* Approval is Received on-chain to build a Compound integration on Y chain\n\n**Development & Deployment** \n\n* AlphaGrowth activates the team who agreed to build the integration \n  * AlphaGrowth checks in regularly to ensure they stay on schedule\n* The Development team gets to work\n* Developers build the contracts\n* Developers Meet with Open Zeppelin and answer all OpenZeppelin’s security concerns. \n* Developers publish the contracts on test net\n* Developers ask Open Zeppelin to review the contracts after they’ve been up for a week\n* AlphaGrowth asks Open Zeppelin for an audit timeline and holds them to it. \n  * Open Zeppelin says the audit is good and the contracts look good on Testnet → 🟢continue\n  * Open Zeppelin finds problems  → 🟡slow and fix\n    * Open Zeppelin provides developer feedback, or fixes the problem themselves → changes feed back into the same approval process. ♻️\n* Open Zeppelin Approves Test Net\n* Developers Push the contracts to Mainnet\n* Open Zeppelin audits the mainnet deployment\n* Open Zeppelin approves of the mainnet deployment\n* **Compound Contracts are LIVE & Approved on Mainnet**\n\n**Launch Processes**\n\n* AlphaGrowth completes the Asset listing process \n* AlphaGrowth completes the Money Market Listing process \n* AlphGrowth prepares a Marketing & Advertising Plan\n* AlphaGrowth tell’s Compound Labs it’s time to push frontend changes adding the new chain, tokens, pools to the compound.finance website. \n* The website changes go live\n* AlphaGrowth kicks off the marketing & advertising plan",

      "title": "Aera for Compound Service Provider Payments",
      "content": "**Simple summary**\n\nWe propose a standard payment process to be followed by all service vendors of the Compound DAO. This new process utilizes on-chain protocols, Aera Vault and LlamaPay, to setup long-term payment streams in USDC that reduces both price-risk for vendors and governance overhead for DAO voters. This has the added benefit of improving the financial position of the DAO treasury allocated to future service costs by supplying liquidity to cUSDCv3 that earns additional yield. \n\nWe propose using an Aera vault as a mechanism for vendors to receive payments in stablecoins while also providing liquidity for key Compound markets for unvested payment streams. Specifically we propose:\n\n1. Creating an Aera vault owned by Compound Governance that deposits a lump sum of COMP based on current annual expense needs plus an additional buffer to hedge for price fluctuations\n2. The Aera vault will diversify out of COMP and into USDC using onchain vehicles like UniV3, Bebop, and Milkman\n3. USDC will be deposited into the Compound III ETH-USDC comet as cUSDCv3 to generate yield on the holdings while providing liquidity to the market\n4. Payment streams will be set up per vendor that uses the Aera vault as a source and the Vendor’s multisig as a sink transferring USDC to meet Compound vendor payment obligations.\n5. On a yearly cadence the Aera vault will be topped up with COMP via Compound governance.\n\nThis proposal will enable the first three steps by initializing an Aera vault and funding it with COMP. Payment streams to vendors will be initiated through future proposals.\n\nThis is a non custodial vault, where the Compound Governor Bravo Timelock is the owner of the vault (and thus governance votes can initiate withdraw/deposit requests at any time). Gauntlet will be the guardian for this vault. \n\n[Full forum post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/proposal-aera-for-compound-service-provider-payments/5226/1)\n\n****************************Specification****************************\n\nThis proposal will:\n    1. acceptOwnership of the Aera vault, hooks module, and asset registry\n    2. \\_grantComp to the Compound Timelock address\n    3. transfer COMP to the vault\n    4. resume the vault, allowing the guardian to operate\n",

After a successful 4 month trial that saw compound launch on Optimism, phased rollout of USDT markets, a 1.8M ARB grant won by the Compound growth program (valued at 37,192 at the time of winning), a 150K OP grant (valued at 7,438 COMP at the time of winning), and additional wins outlined below. \n\nGoing forward the Growth program will assume greater responsibility within the community in expanding the Chains, markets, tokens and any third party integrations for the protocol. We aim to increase TVL by $500 Million and increase revenue for the Compound DAO by $10M in the coming year. For this the Growth program requires 75,246 COMP for 12 months, which includes\n\n* 40,200 COMP in program expenses (including developer charges, chain-market launch ops, grant consultation,marketing planning and more)\n* 18,504 COMP in Marketing fund (to be returned if unutilized)\n* 18,504 COMP in Integrations fund (to be returned if unutilized)\n\n![](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/compound/proposal/2321266312052999647)**Wins:**\n\nThe trial phase of the growth program, which spanned from December 2023 to April 2024, was successful in achieving a number of key milestones that will define the growth of the protocol in the coming year. For reference we accomplished the following wins in the last 4 months\n\n* Launched Compound on OP network 2 weeks ago (currently $5MM TVL)\n\n![](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/compound/proposal/2321266312052999647)<img height=\"232\" width=\"557\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/5153d13d-fa92-4c0d-aed2-2feb1ff77a2a_original.png\" />\n\n* Secured $3M grant from Arbitrum for Compound\n* Kick started the process to launch USDT Markets on 4 existing chains\n* Currently upgrading the rewards contract to be able to distribute rewards simultaneously in multiple tokens\n* Marketing campaigns saw the following results:\n  * USDC on Arbitrum saw active users increase from 1.6K wallets to 14K wallets and user counts are still rising.![](https://static.tally.xyz/cf5ab00a-932f-4803-892b-a8a8421adbd4_original.png)\n    * [<u>Source</u>](https://risk.gauntlet.xyz/protocols/compound/markets/v3-arbitrum-usdc?fullscreen=market_health_timeseries_accounts)\n  * OP USDC market achieved 12000 active users in the second week of marketing the deployment. [<u>Source</u>](https://risk.gauntlet.xyz/protocols/compound/markets/v3-optimism-usdc?fullscreen=market_health_timeseries_accounts)![](https://static.tally.xyz/255446f1-ff07-4079-8d16-55836518a4d6_original.png)\n* The following new assets are in the process of being listed:\n  * LRTs: ezETH, weETH, rsETH\n  * LSTs: rETH, stETH, wstETH\n  * Native: USDC(Base), USDC(ARB), USDC(OP), USDC(Polygon)\n  * Proposed(Not Ready): gmBTC\n* Started Integrations:\n  * Sommelier Finance Vault → Automated position management \n  * Qi Dao Base Integration → PSM for Base [<u>Link </u>](https://www.comp.xyz/t/integration-of-compound-tokens-on-base-qidao/5080)\n  * BaseSwap [<u>Link</u>](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0xeb047900b28a9f90f3c0e65768b23e7542a65163\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=65f359051080cbb344b2a812\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true)\n* \\[PENDING] One $500K grant from an ETH L2\n* \\[PENDING] Two separate $5MM Bootstrap & $500K grants from two EVM L2s\n* \\[PENDING] Three $1M launch incentive grants from three ETH L2s\n\nThe trial phase of the growth program also presented opportunities for us to explore the strategies that work for Compound. We learned that some opportunities (like the following) take more time and effort.\n\n* V2 ▶️V3 migrations:\n* New Dapp integrations\n* Wallet integrations\n* Working with Institutional Custodians\n* Centralized exchange integration\n\n## Why Compound Growth?\n\nThe time to act is now, propelled by a combination of market, technology, and trending macro dynamics that uniquely position us to seize emerging opportunities. Currently, over eight blockchain networks have expressed interest, with three already committing verbally to provide $1 million each in incentives to support our launch. This surge in interest coincides with the need to deploy the ARB grant strategically, ensuring we capitalize on this moment of heightened engagement and potential growth.\n\nOn the technological front, we've broken new ground with the creation of a multi-token reward contract—a first of its kind, exclusively available today because of our innovation. This isn't just about having cutting-edge technology; it's about utilizing it effectively. Like a high-performance vehicle, it requires a skilled driver to navigate the path ahead, and we are uniquely equipped to steer this initiative towards success.\n\nMacro trends further underscore the urgency. Recently, Compound experienced a significant dip, losing $400 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) as cryptocurrency prices, including ETH and BTC, have fallen. To counteract this and bolster our platform, it’s crucial to diversify by adding new assets and expanding our markets. This will not only help recoup the lost TVL but also enhance the flexibility and options available to our token holders, making our ecosystem more resilient and adaptable to changing market conditions.\n\n## Priorities and Plan for Growth\n\n* **Total Value Locked (TVL) Expansion:** Aim to increase TVL by $500 million across new and existing markets.\n* **Treasury Growth:** Target generating $10 million in treasury growth for the DAO, ensuring the Growth program is cost-neutral.\n* **Market Development:** Launch 8-15 new markets, including USDT markets on all applicable chains, with a focus on high TVL opportunities.\n* **Chain Expansion:** Expand Compound to 4-6 additional blockchain networks, implementing quantitative criteria for chain selection.\n* **Strategic Partnerships:** Establish high-value, industry-first partnerships and continue leveraging incentives from collaborations.\n* **User Acquisition:** Significantly increase over 25,000 new users, leveraging successful campaigns and focusing on L2’s and new market launches solutions\n* **Infrastructure Expansions:** Evaluate reputable partnerships for key infrastructure such as bridges and oracles and collaborate with new partners as new opportunities arrive.\n\n### Growth methodology\n\n**Asset and Market Expansion**: During our initial trial period, a significant focus was on enhancing ways to grow and sustain Compound. This next phase aims to bolster our financial foundation while expanding our market presence strategically. We plan to launch between 8 to 15 new markets, with a particular emphasis on USDT markets, setting a standard for new market criteria to ensure each has the potential for at least $20 million in TVL. This approach not only drives growth but also assures that the benefits to the DAO outweigh the costs of the Growth program.\n\n**Chain Integration and User Growth:** We are set to push for expansion onto six more blockchain networks, making substantial inroads in Chain integration by setting precise, quantitative selection criteria. This method will help the community understand the advantages and challenges of each new deployment. Furthermore, our user acquisition strategy has already shown promising results, with significant increases in user numbers on platforms like Arbitrum. By continuing to focus on Layer 2 solutions and securing more partnerships with entities like Revolut and OKX DeFi, we aim to dramatically expand our user base and strengthen our market position.\n\nThrough these strategic initiatives, Compound is poised to not only expand its footprint but also to solidify its standing as a leader in the decentralized finance space, driving forward with confidence and innovative vigor.\n\n## Contribution & Why Our Team is Essential\n\n###\n\nCompound operates within a dynamic and complex ecosystem, characterized by its decentralized nature and reliance on multiple contributors. Maintaining both high-quality standards and timely engagement in such an environment requires obsession. Our behind-the-scenes conversations play a critical role in reinforcing Compound's reputation as a consistent and reputable platform that is now ready to get creative in working with emerging market players.\n\nOur team has spearheaded 15 key proposals and discussions during the trial phase of the Compound Growth Program, encompassing a range of topics from market expansions to contract upgrades. We our committed to driving Compound's governance forward.\n\nMoreover, our proactive approach in generating new ideas and executing spontaneous projects has generated positive feedback and enthusiastic engagement from the community. These initiatives not only demonstrate our ability to anticipate and react to market needs in real time. Fostering the ongoing evolution of the Compound ecosystem.\n\nOur business development team is unrivaled in the cryptocurrency space, comprising 14 dedicated professionals who span the entire spectrum of marketing, business development, and sales engineering. This allows us to identify new opportunities, close deals, and seamlessly integrate new partners, maintaining Compound's competitive edge. Managing over 400 groups within the Compound framework, our use of sophisticated CRM tools and data analytics enables us to monitor and adapt to the ecosystem's evolution effectively.\n\nWe are continually approached by other ecosystems seeking our expertise to expand their operations, which attests to our reputation and success in the field. The growth and sustainability of the Compound protocol have been significantly influenced by our contributions, and we are eager to continue this trajectory, preferring to enhance Compound's stature rather than shifting our focus to another entity.\n\nIn summary, our team not only contributes to but critically sustains the growth and innovation at Compound. Our 'secret sauce'—a combination of expert knowledge, strategic foresight, and comprehensive execution capabilities—sets us apart from the competition and is essential for the continued success and expansion of the Compound ecosystem.\n\n## Budget Request Breakdown\n\nOur budget ask is neatly segmented into nine essential components, each crafted to bolster various facets of Compound’s growth and operations. Let’s dive into the details:\n\n1. Operations\n   1. Strategy & Data Research\n   2. Protocol Expansion & Business Development\n   3. Development Fund\n   4. Marketing Operations\n   5. Grant Consultation\n2. Marketing Fund\n3. Integration Grants\n4. Governance Delegation\n5. Liquidity Support\n\n#### **Strategy & Operations**\n\nThe service fee, at 3350 COMP/month, covers all costs associated with running our expansive program. This includes five critical areas of the growth program operations, which we've detailed below:\n\n* Scope 1: Strategy & Data Research: Tasked with uncovering new growth avenues, our team ensures the DAO is well-informed and ready to act on emerging opportunities.\n* Scope 2: Protocol Expansion Operations: We cover end-to-end deployment of chains, markets, and strategic integrations. Our previous successes, like the deployment on the Optimism network, highlight the intensive resources and effort involved, justifying the continuation and expansion of these efforts.\n* Scope 3: Development Fund: Our technical team is geared up to support the protocol expansion with dedicated coding resources, ensuring swift and efficient integration of new markets and chains.\n* Scope 4: Marketing Operations: Led by the former head of growth of the Near Foundation, our marketing team is set to supercharge Compound's visibility through targeted campaigns and influencer partnerships.\n* Scope 5: Grant Consultation: Securing grants for Compound from ecosystems and partners. We’ll handle everything from writing applications to distributing grant incentives on behalf of Compound. We will be good stewards of grants received on behalf of Compound. \n\n#### **Marketing Fund**\n\nOur marketing fund, allocated 1542 COMP/month, will drive demand through dynamic events highlighting new integrations and deployments within the Compound ecosystem. The recent surge in active users on the USDC Arbitrum market from 1.6K to over 8K exemplifies the impact of our strategic marketing efforts.\n\n#### **Integration Fund**\n\nThe integration fund we had in the trial phase proved to be extremely useful. Set at 1542 COMP/month, focuses on expediting development and funding strategic initiatives that enhance Compound’s infrastructure and capabilities.  To build up on this, we are now solidifying the requirement for an Integrations fund that will fund strategic initiatives that otherwise would not be funded due to multiple limitations. (like CGP ceiling of $30K for Grants)\n\n#### **Governance Delegation** \n\nTo influence governance effectively, we are seeking a 100,000 COMP delegation, representing a quarter of the votes necessary for decision-making in proposals. \n\n#### **Liquidity Support**\n\nWe aim to get COMP listed as a collateral asset and enhance market functionality. To do this requires reaching $15MM in COMP and $15MM in counterparty token on a dex listing. We don’t know if we’ll have to supply all of the liquidity to reach $15M or if this is a zero to one problem and once a pool is created liquidity will flow in organically. To reduce risk we would like to create a COMP pool on one chain and bootstrap the first 10,000 COMP from the treasury as bootstrapped liquidity to overcome the zero to one problem of pool creation. We will learn from the outcome the best path forward to getting COMP listed as collateral. These initiatives are designed to deepen on-chain liquidity and reduce slippage, crucial for efficient COMP to USDC swaps.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/2d7b86bf-e1da-4850-bc9a-021c784e3bf5_original.png)\n\nThrough these structured funding requests, we aim to propel Compound into a future marked by robust growth, innovative expansion, and enhanced governance participation—all while ensuring the protocol remains a leader in the DeFi space.\n\n## Operational Process\n\n### TL; DR;  \n\nAs a business development, marketing & sales engineering organization, AlphaGrowth will continue to use the following processes and approaches to accelerate execution while working on deals involving a dozen or more stakeholders. \n\nOur base operational practices remain the same whether we are listing a new Token, Market, or Chain, each initiative has special considerations and additions to our base process. For example here is the process we’ve identified for listing Compound on a new chain <[<u>Link</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GPQYis8s_cAxvy43GOFgeXESg6VahLyVDWwMRVQ2QRE/edit#heading=h.ycec3ktzsbks)>, it involves 71 steps, 9 approval phases, and 8 organizations. Our ability to turn decentralized communities into discrete manageable processes, is what allows us to scale. \n\n## Operation Process Table of Contents\n\n1. TL; DR;  \n2. Table of Contents\n3. Our base operational process\n4. Special Considerations\n5. Marketing\n6. Software Development\n7. Appropriate Use of Funds\n8. Impact & Transparency\n\n### Base Process\n\n**Market Research**\n\nWhether launching a new chain, asset or market. Every opportunity AlphaGrowth pursues for Compound starts with extensive **market research**: Our team leverages our internal insights platform with its over 31 million on-and-off-chain data points, 108+ connected chains, and real time data ingestion & processing. Using real-time market data we identify the best potential integrations for Compound. We’ve currently tracking:\n\n1. 58,224 token projects\n2. Our network with close ties to 5,545 Dapp partners\n3. Hundreds of DEXs of which we have close relationships with 18.\n4. 50+ EVM based chains suitable for a Compound Integration\n\nWe scan for partners with deep liquidity, healthy metrics and a positive attitude toward Compound for potential collaboration. \n\n**Risk Analysis**\n\nNext we perform integration risk checks for target partners, and collaborate with risk analytics partners to identify all variables associated with adding the partner to the Compound ecosystem. \n\n**Outbounds**\n\nOnce the research and risk analytics phases are concluded, the real fun begins. Our team reaches out to shortlisted partners, pushing narrative and advocating for the partner to get involved with Compound. \n\n**Sales Engineering**\n\nAlphaGrowth works closely with both the prospective blockchains, token projects and the integration teams to analyze the viability of integration. AlphaGrowth tracks technical infrastructure requirements to be able to launch new chains, tokens & markets with Compound. We identify any blockers and architect solutions that will be carried out by our developers if the partnership advances. \n\n**Negotiation**\n\nIf a 3rd party ecosystem, treasury or dapp are involved, AlphaGrowth negotiates with the 3rd party to ensure the partnership’s success. For example, we ensure partners: \n\n1. Bootstrap pool launches by supplying sufficient Protocol Owed Liquidity.\n2. List their tokens in a timely manner and according to Compounds marketing schedule.\n3. Align incentives for win-win-win integrations. \n\n**Integration & Marketing**\n\nAlphaGrowth then collaborates closely with the teams of selected projects to ensure integration and deployment is on track. We also ensure adequate co-marketing campaigns are run with the integrating team to spread awareness for the integration\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nEach potential integration has a unique set of criteria that must be met for the opportunity to be considered a positive addition to the compound ecosystem. For Chains we target ecosystems whose goals are aligned with Compound’s and will work in the best interest of Compound to increase TVL, utility and revenue. For Tokens, we look for deep liquidity, healthy metrics and a positive attitude toward Compound for potential collaboration. For partnerships to increase TVL, we look for DeFi platforms with meaningful TVL generating potential through their existing audience and that audience’s interest in taking advantage of the opportunities Compound provides. \n\nEach partnership is different and the hundreds of conversations we’ve had for compound (and input from Gauntlet and the community) help us steer toward the best ones. \n\n### Marketing\n\nApart from the core business development activities, AlphaGrowth will also engage in auxiliary growth and marketing efforts to forward Compound’s cause. These will include:\n\n### Targeted Advertising:\n\nAlphaGrowth works with the Blockchain Ads team. Blockchain Ads has a proven record in reaching the right people in a very targeted manner, providing personalized advertising, curated based on people's on-chain behavior. Such as their most recent campaign for the Compound Academy.Blockchain Ads enables user acquisition at scale, and the ability to get Compound’s offerings in front of the owners of high value wallets.\n\nHow Blockchain Ads performs Traffic Source Stacking.\n\n1. High incentives are advertised to make participation worthwhile for big bag hodlers\n2. Blockchain-Ads target crypto enthusiasts based on their on-chain activity. \n3. Ads link DIRECTLY to a well-designed quest on Layer3.\n4. Users who click are taken straight into an interactive experience, increasing the chance of conversion.\n\nWhy a smooth experience increases conversion and retention\n\n1. They reduce friction by directing ad traffic straight to take an action through a quest. The quest format gamifies onboarding while teaching users about Compound and its partners. Completing the quest then earns rewards, solidifying the users first positive experience.\n\n### Quests:\n\nLayer3 has been very successful creating a collection of quests and streaks aimed at acquiring, onboarding, engaging, and retaining users on Compound V3, together called ‘Compound Academy’.\n\nThe quests guide users through Compound V3, Compound Extensions, and Compound Governance. \n\nThe Compound Growth program will lean into this strategy as new chains and markets are launched.\n\n### Twitter AMAs: \n\nThe AlphaGrowth team will work closely with DeFi communities to organize AMAs featuring Compound Integrations. In cases where the Compound labs team is unavailable, either a vetted Compound community member or AlphaGrowth will speak on Compound’s behalf. \n\nMarket each new opportunity for users to participate with Compound. We use tools like Blockchain Ads to target users by their wallet addresses ensuring highly relevant content is delivered to traders with the highest chance of converting (based on their historic activities). \n\n### Software Development\n\nThe Development program has 4 main areas of focus: deployment of new markets, development of new features, protocol maintenance, and consulting.\n\nWoof Software will work in tandem with AlphaGrowth to advance Compound through the continuous development of new features, community initiatives, and markets, as well as protocol maintenance, and support of external developers who want to contribute to the Compound Protocol.\n\nDuring the previous 3 months, Woof Software has trained its team with in-depth details of the Compound Protocol codebase and on-chain proposals deployment. We’ve also established working relationships with Compound Labs, OpenZeppelin, and Gauntlet to build a quick and effective development flow. Currently, Woof Software receives its requirements from the community and Compound Growth Team (AlphaGrowth).\n\n**Current projects**\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/626e67e7-2190-4844-9f41-50ca761c568a_original.png)\n\n**Development Process**\n\nThe program aims to establish long-term processes that will benefit each party involved in the delivery of new features.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/b4f48ab9-3d71-41ee-8a6a-0e8c10aed3cc_original.png)\n\n**Focus areas**\n\n* **Deployment of new markets:** Deployment of new markets with different collaterals on new and existing chains\n* **Development of new features:** On-demand development of new features like [<u>Comet Rewards V2</u>](https://www.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0xeb047900b28a9f90f3c0e65768b23e7542a65163\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=65cce2693dc7ecb321240d83\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true).\n* **Consulting:** Developers may directly reach out to the Woof Software team, or ask questions in the Discord development chat [<u>\\[see example\\]</u>](https://discord.com/channels/402910780124561410/402912055448961034/1232636590208057375). \n* **Protocol Maintenance:** Development and updating of such infrastructure components as Compound.js, updating information on aggregators like DeFi Llama, refactoring of documentation, etc.\n\n**Communication**\n\n1. **Forum:** When we start working on a project we will post an outline with estimated timelines to the forum. We will update the forum thread after each step in the outline has been achieved - as well as in case of any changes. We will reply to any questions on the forum within 2 working days.\n2. **Community calls:** We will attend all Community Calls in Discord and provide transparent updates.\n3. **Monthly Forum updates:** We will post updates about all ongoing, delivered, and planned projects during the month.\\*\\*\\*\\* \n\n**Deliverables:** \n\n1. Deliverables will be open-sourced and stored in the Woof Software GitHub repository.\n2. Deliverables include \n   1. Forum Discussion\n   2. Documentation\n   3. Deployment if applicable\n   4. On-chain proposal \n   5. Post-deployment support\n\n### Appropriate Use of Funds\n\nFor funds allocated as marketing fund or integration fu; AlphaGrowth will conduct a Post-program audit to list out all the expenses incurred and activities associated with these categories. Any unspent funds assigned to these Categories will be returned back to the Compound Treasury at the end of the time period of the program. With the exception of the liquidity bootstrap loans which will stay in place until the Compound Community votes them returned to the treasury. \n\n### Impact and Transparency\n\nTo align incentives for AlphaGrowth to go above and beyond. At the end of this 12-month engagement, AlphaGrowth will propose a performance bonus to be voted on by the Compound Community.  This bonus will also be a signal for AlphaGrowth to proceed and take on further responsibility within the Compound ecosystem.\n\nAt AlphaGrowth, we like doing business in public. To keep the community informed on the progress and ensure transparency, AlphaGrowth will provide: \n\n* Monthly reports on the progress of BD activities (12 reports)\n* Quarterly Progress reports highlighting various deals in the pipeline, successful integrations, closed deals, and learnings (4 reports)\n* A database that gives all the program-specific information to the community so that the members can come, verify and inquire about the process.\n* Post-program analysis and report about spends on budget categories 3,4 & 5\n* We have kept track of the [<u>130+ calls</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kZyRXWNXU-CZF-USXsOIbSQR6SVtGV5RhbiaQWlmWqQ/edit#gid=1315745627) we’ve taken on Compound’s behalf and will make our call logs available upon request \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------\n\n## **Operational Launch Process - Adding Compound to a new Chain** \n\nHey Compound Community, we’ve identified the following process to streamline approval & execution when adding Compound to a new chain. Please let us know if there is anything missing that we should add. \n\n**For Inbound Chain Requests**\n\n* Provide an application where chains to apply\n* Review the form to make sure it was done correctly, provide feedback to the chain\n\n**For Outbound Chain Requests**\n\n* AlphaGrowth identifies target chains based on their histories, TVL, etc … \n* AlphaGrowth sells the chain on a potential collaboration with Compound, requesting incentives and responsive engineers.\n* AlphaGrowth works with the chain to answer an initial pass of questions to qualify their chain as a potential candidate. \n\n**Is this a viable business opportunity?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth provides the chain’s answers to Gauntlet\n* Gauntlet provides a soft Go-No-Go\n* AlphaGrowth provides the Chain a template to post their desire to work with Compound on the Forum from their organization’s account. \n* The community waits for Gauntlet to reply on the forum that they will start their independent analysis. \n* Gauntlet’s independent analysis usually takes 1-2 weeks\n* Gauntlet Approves or Denies. This is a FINAL decision, if Gauntlet denies the opportunity stops 🛑If Gauntlet approves the opportunity continues 🟢\n\n**Does the Chain have an Oracle?** \n\n* ChainLink supports the chain → Continue to Finding Builders 🟢\n* ChainLink does NOT support the chain\n  * Chainlink says “We will never support” → Opportunity Stops 🛑\n  * ChainLink is in the process of supporting this chain → Wait & Continue 🟢\n  * ChainLink will but wants to be paid. AlphaGrowth goes to the Chain and tells them they need to pay chainlink to build the integration.\n    * The chain is unwilling to pay → Opportunity Stops 🛑\n    * The chain will pay → Wait & Continue 🟢\n* Redstone is also vetted as an oracle and can be contacted\n\n**Who will build the Compound Integration?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth finds a team to build the new chain’s Compound Integration. \n* AlphaGrowth asks for a development timeline to hold them accountable.\n\n**Who will fund the builders?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth finds a team to fund building the Compound Integration.\n* First AlphaGrowth approaches the Compound Grants Program (Questbook). \n  * AlphaGrowth shares a high level proposal\n  * If Questbook soft approves, AlphaGrowth provides a template for the development team to post their plans on the questbook public forum. \n  * If Questbook approves the funding → 🟢continue\n* If Questbook refuses to pay, AlphaGrowth tells the chain to pay for themselves\n  * If the chain says yes → 🟢continue\n* If the Chain can’t fund it, AlphaGrowth may deploy our own grant funds. At this point we need a Really Good business reason to do so. → 🟢continue\n  * If AlphaGrowth won’t fund it the opportunity stops 🛑\n* When funding is secured, move to auditing the chain. \n\n**Is the chain secure?**\n\n* AlphaGrowth asks Open Zeppelin to Audit the Blockchain/Token and submits for consideration Gauntlet’s Approval, Funding Approval & Open Zeppelin’s Template Form\n  * Open Zeppelin Rejects the Blockchain → Opportunity Stops 🛑\n  * Open Zeppelin Approves → 🟢Continue\n* Audit Approvals Received \\[Open Zeppelin & Gauntlet]\n\n**How much initial liquidity can be provided?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth meets with the compound growth DAO to negotiate how much initial liquidity they can provide on the new chain. Topics include how much liquidity the chain itself is providing. Supplied liquidity is not spent, it still belongs to the treasury and has been placed to overcome the cold start problem for the new chain. \n  * Compound Growth DAO will supply sufficient Liquidity → 🟢continue\n  * Compound Growth DAO will NOT supply sufficient Liquidity → 🟡\n    * Is there sufficient liquidity elsewhere to continue forward? \n      * Yes → 🟢continue\n      * No → 🛑stop\n* Sufficient Initial Liquidity is committed to continue\n\n**How will the new chain be accessed?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth meets with Compound Labs, provides a report of the opportunity, and asks if Compound Labs will update the Compound frontend to include the new token when the integration launches. If the pool isn’t on the front end, it’s practically unusable.\n  * Yes → 🟢continue\n  * No → 🛑stop and wait for a yes and a firm timeline. \n\n**Will the community approve?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth asks a delegate to make an On-Chain Voting Post using the Chain’s original forum post (copy-paste)\n* The Delegate publishes the On-Chain voting post\n* AlphaGrowth comments on the Chain’s original forum post informing the community that there’s an on-chain vote with the link. **Very simple post:** Update: Approved by Gauntlet, Approved by Open Zeppelin, we’re starting an on chain vote. Here’s the link.\n* The on-chain voting takes 3 days\n  * The vote fails → 🛑stop\n  * The vote Passes → 🟢continue\n* Approval is Received on-chain to build a Compound integration on Y chain\n\n**Development & Deployment** \n\n* AlphaGrowth activates the team who agreed to build the integration \n  * AlphaGrowth checks in regularly to ensure they stay on schedule\n* The Development team gets to work\n* Developers build the contracts\n* Developers Meet with Open Zeppelin and answer all OpenZeppelin’s security concerns. \n* Developers publish the contracts on test net\n* Developers ask Open Zeppelin to review the contracts after they’ve been up for a week\n* AlphaGrowth asks Open Zeppelin for an audit timeline and holds them to it. \n  * Open Zeppelin says the audit is good and the contracts look good on Testnet → 🟢continue\n  * Open Zeppelin finds problems  → 🟡slow and fix\n    * Open Zeppelin provides developer feedback, or fixes the problem themselves → changes feed back into the same approval process. ♻️\n* Open Zeppelin Approves Test Net\n* Developers Push the contracts to Mainnet\n* Open Zeppelin audits the mainnet deployment\n* Open Zeppelin approves of the mainnet deployment\n* **Compound Contracts are LIVE & Approved on Mainnet**\n\n**Launch Processes**\n\n* AlphaGrowth completes the Asset listing process \n* AlphaGrowth completes the Money Market Listing process \n* AlphGrowth prepares a Marketing & Advertising Plan\n* AlphaGrowth tell’s Compound Labs it’s time to push frontend changes adding the new chain, tokens, pools to the compound.finance website. \n* The website changes go live\n* AlphaGrowth kicks off the marketing & advertising plan",

      "content": "The goldCOMP DeFi vault (https://humpysgold.eth.limo/#/vaults/comp) created by the Golden Boys is an exciting new strategy designed to provide COMP holders yields on their COMP tokens. When a user places COMP into the goldCOMP vault, the depositor receives goldCOMP, a semi-liquid wrapped token representing their initial deposit. These goldCOMP tokens can be placed in a 99/1 Balancer pool to earn yields averaging 10% annually, creating a passive income stream for COMP holders who plan to hold COMP for a long period of time. The depositor’s goldCOMP can be burnt to receive the initial COMP during regular withdrawal windows with no risk of slashing or penalty. GoldCOMP is an exciting investment opportunity for any COMP holder, aimed to enrich the Compound Finance ecosystem.\n\nThe proposal seeks a 1 year investment of 92,000 COMP of Treasury funds into the goldCOMP DeFi vault, to generate interest on 5% of treasury’s non-interest bearing COMP holdings.\n\nShould this proposal pass, Compound DAO transfers 92,000 COMP tokens to the Golden Boys multi-sig wallet.\nThe Golden Boys multi-sig wallet will deposit the 92,000 COMP into goldCOMP vault to receive goldCOMP\nThe Golden Boys multi-sig wallet stakes the full amount of received goldCOMP tokens into the 99/1 goldCOMP/wETH Balancer Pool\nThe Golden Boys multi-sig converts the yields generated by goldCOMP from Balancer Pool into COMP, then transfer COMP back to the COMPtroller on the first day of every quarter.\nAfter 365 days, Golden Boys multi-sig wallet withdraws 92,000 COMP from goldCOMP Vault, receives COMP and transfer back to Compound DAO COMPtroller.\n\nProposal Operations:\n\nTransfer 92,000 COMP to 0x941dcEA21101A385b979286CC6D6A9Bf435EB1C2",

      "title": "Compound Growth Program 12-Month Term",
      "content": "## TL; DR;\n\nAlphaGrowth proposes the renewal of the Compound Growth program for a tenure of 12 months. After a successful 4 month trial that saw compound launch on Optimism, phased rollout of USDT markets, a 1.8M ARB grant won by the Compound growth program (valued at 33,515 at the time of writing), a 310K OP grant valued at (15,459 COMP) when received, and additional wins outlined below. \n\nGoing forward the Growth program will assume greater responsibility within the community in expanding the Chains, markets, tokens and any third party integrations for the protocol. We aim to increase TVL by $500 Million and increase revenue for the Compound DAO by $10M in the coming year. For this the Growth program requires 75,246 COMP for 12 months, which includes\n\n* 40,200 COMP in program expenses (including developer charges, chain-market launch ops, grant consultation,marketing planning and more)\n* 18,504 COMP in Marketing fund (to be returned if unutilized)\n* 18,504 COMP in Integrations fund (to be returned if unutilized)\n\n\n\n![]()**Wins:**\n\nThe trial phase of the growth program, which spanned from December 2023 to April 2024, was successful in achieving a number of key milestones that will define the growth of the protocol in the coming year. For reference we accomplished the following wins in the last 4 months\n\n* Launched Compound on OP network 2 weeks ago (currently $5MM TVL)\n\n![]()<img height=\"232\" width=\"557\" src=\"https://static.tally.xyz/5153d13d-fa92-4c0d-aed2-2feb1ff77a2a_original.png\" />\n\n* Secured $3M grant from Arbitrum for Compound\n* Kick started the process to launch USDT Markets on 4 existing chains\n* Currently upgrading the rewards contract to be able to distribute rewards simultaneously in multiple tokens\n* Marketing campaigns saw the following results:\n  * USDC on Arbitrum saw active users increase from 1.6K wallets to 14K wallets and user counts are still rising.![](https://static.tally.xyz/cf5ab00a-932f-4803-892b-a8a8421adbd4_original.png)\n    * [<u>Source</u>](https://risk.gauntlet.xyz/protocols/compound/markets/v3-arbitrum-usdc?fullscreen=market_health_timeseries_accounts)\n  * OP USDC market achieved 12000 active users in the second week of marketing the deployment.

We learned that some opportunities (like the following) take more time and effort.\n\n* V2 ▶️V3 migrations:\n* New Dapp integrations\n* Wallet integrations\n* Working with Institutional Custodians\n* Centralized exchange integration\n\n## Why Compound Growth?\n\n\n\nThe time to act is now, propelled by a combination of market, technology, and trending macro dynamics that uniquely position us to seize emerging opportunities. Currently, over eight blockchain networks have expressed interest, with three already committing verbally to provide $1 million each in incentives to support our launch. This surge in interest coincides with the need to deploy the ARB grant strategically, ensuring we capitalize on this moment of heightened engagement and potential growth.\n\nOn the technological front, we've broken new ground with the creation of a multi-token reward contract—a first of its kind, exclusively available today because of our innovation. This isn't just about having cutting-edge technology; it's about utilizing it effectively. Like a high-performance vehicle, it requires a skilled driver to navigate the path ahead, and we are uniquely equipped to steer this initiative towards success.\n\nMacro trends further underscore the urgency. Recently, Compound experienced a significant dip, losing $400 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) as cryptocurrency prices, including ETH and BTC, have fallen. To counteract this and bolster our platform, it’s crucial to diversify by adding new assets and expanding our markets. This will not only help recoup the lost TVL but also enhance the flexibility and options available to our token holders, making our ecosystem more resilient and adaptable to changing market conditions.\n\n\n\n## Priorities and Plan for Growth\n\n* **Total Value Locked (TVL) Expansion:** Aim to increase TVL by $500 million across new and existing markets.\n* **Treasury Growth:** Target generating $10 million in treasury growth for the DAO, ensuring the Growth program is cost-neutral.\n* **Market Development:** Launch 8-15 new markets, including USDT markets on all applicable chains, with a focus on high TVL opportunities.\n* **Chain Expansion:** Expand Compound to 4-6 additional blockchain networks, implementing quantitative criteria for chain selection.\n* **Strategic Partnerships:** Establish high-value, industry-first partnerships and continue leveraging incentives from collaborations.\n* **User Acquisition:** Significantly increase over 25,000 new users, leveraging successful campaigns and focusing on L2’s and new market launches solutions\n* **Infrastructure Expansions:** Evaluate reputable partnerships for key infrastructure such as bridges and oracles and collaborate with new partners as new opportunities arrive.\n\n\n\n### Growth methodology\n\n**Asset and Market Expansion**: During our initial trial period, a significant focus was on enhancing ways to grow and sustain Compound. This next phase aims to bolster our financial foundation while expanding our market presence strategically. We plan to launch between 8 to 15 new markets, with a particular emphasis on USDT markets, setting a standard for new market criteria to ensure each has the potential for at least $20 million in TVL. This approach not only drives growth but also assures that the benefits to the DAO outweigh the costs of the Growth program.\n\n**Chain Integration and User Growth:** We are set to push for expansion onto six more blockchain networks, making substantial inroads in Chain integration by setting precise, quantitative selection criteria. This method will help the community understand the advantages and challenges of each new deployment. Furthermore, our user acquisition strategy has already shown promising results, with significant increases in user numbers on platforms like Arbitrum. By continuing to focus on Layer 2 solutions and securing more partnerships with entities like Revolut and OKX DeFi, we aim to dramatically expand our user base and strengthen our market position.\n\nThrough these strategic initiatives, Compound is poised to not only expand its footprint but also to solidify its standing as a leader in the decentralized finance space, driving forward with confidence and innovative vigor.\n\n\n\n## Contribution & Why Our Team is Essential\n\n###\n\nCompound operates within a dynamic and complex ecosystem, characterized by its decentralized nature and reliance on multiple contributors. Maintaining both high-quality standards and timely engagement in such an environment requires obsession. Our behind-the-scenes conversations play a critical role in reinforcing Compound's reputation as a consistent and reputable platform that is now ready to get creative in working with emerging market players.\n\nOur team has spearheaded 15 key proposals and discussions during the trial phase of the Compound Growth Program, encompassing a range of topics from market expansions to contract upgrades. We our committed to driving Compound's governance forward.\n\nMoreover, our proactive approach in generating new ideas and executing spontaneous projects has generated positive feedback and enthusiastic engagement from the community. These initiatives not only demonstrate our ability to anticipate and react to market needs in real time. Fostering the ongoing evolution of the Compound ecosystem.\n\nOur business development team is unrivaled in the cryptocurrency space, comprising 14 dedicated professionals who span the entire spectrum of marketing, business development, and sales engineering. This allows us to identify new opportunities, close deals, and seamlessly integrate new partners, maintaining Compound's competitive edge. Managing over 400 groups within the Compound framework, our use of sophisticated CRM tools and data analytics enables us to monitor and adapt to the ecosystem's evolution effectively.\n\nWe are continually approached by other ecosystems seeking our expertise to expand their operations, which attests to our reputation and success in the field. The growth and sustainability of the Compound protocol have been significantly influenced by our contributions, and we are eager to continue this trajectory, preferring to enhance Compound's stature rather than shifting our focus to another entity.\n\nIn summary, our team not only contributes to but critically sustains the growth and innovation at Compound. Our 'secret sauce'—a combination of expert knowledge, strategic foresight, and comprehensive execution capabilities—sets us apart from the competition and is essential for the continued success and expansion of the Compound ecosystem.\n\n\n\n## Budget Request Breakdown\n\n\n\nOur budget ask is neatly segmented into nine essential components, each crafted to bolster various facets of Compound’s growth and operations. Let’s dive into the details:\n\n1. Operations\n   1. Strategy & Data Research\n   2. Protocol Expansion & Business Development\n   3. Development Fund\n   4. Marketing Operations\n   5. Grant Consultation\n2. Marketing Fund\n3. Integration Grants\n4. Governance Delegation\n5. Liquidity Support\n\n#### **Strategy & Operations**\n\nThe service fee, at 3350 COMP/month, covers all costs associated with running our expansive program. This includes five critical areas of the growth program operations, which we've detailed below:\n\n* Scope 1: Strategy & Data Research: Tasked with uncovering new growth avenues, our team ensures the DAO is well-informed and ready to act on emerging opportunities.\n* Scope 2: Protocol Expansion Operations: We cover end-to-end deployment of chains, markets, and strategic integrations. Our previous successes, like the deployment on the Optimism network, highlight the intensive resources and effort involved, justifying the continuation and expansion of these efforts.\n* Scope 3: Development Fund: Our technical team is geared up to support the protocol expansion with dedicated coding resources, ensuring swift and efficient integration of new markets and chains.\n* Scope 4: Marketing Operations: Led by the former head of growth of the Near Foundation, our marketing team is set to supercharge Compound's visibility through targeted campaigns and influencer partnerships.\n* Scope 5: Grant Consultation: Securing grants for Compound from ecosystems and partners. We’ll handle everything from writing applications to distributing grant incentives on behalf of Compound. We will be good stewards of grants received on behalf of Compound. \n\n#### **Marketing Fund**\n\nOur marketing fund, allocated 1542 COMP/month, will drive demand through dynamic events highlighting new integrations and deployments within the Compound ecosystem. The recent surge in active users on the USDC Arbitrum market from 1.6K to over 8K exemplifies the impact of our strategic marketing efforts.\n\n#### **Integration Fund**\n\nThe integration fund we had in the trial phase proved to be extremely useful. Set at 1542 COMP/month, focuses on expediting development and funding strategic initiatives that enhance Compound’s infrastructure and capabilities.  To build up on this, we are now solidifying the requirement for an Integrations fund that will fund strategic initiatives that otherwise would not be funded due to multiple limitations. (like CGP ceiling of $30K for Grants)\n\n#### **Governance Delegation** \n\nTo influence governance effectively, we are seeking a 100,000 COMP delegation, representing a quarter of the votes necessary for decision-making in proposals. \n\n#### **Liquidity Support**\n\nWe aim to get COMP listed as a collateral asset and enhance market functionality. To do this requires reaching $15MM in COMP and $15MM in counterparty token on a dex listing. We don’t know if we’ll have to supply all of the liquidity to reach $15M or if this is a zero to one problem and once a pool is created liquidity will flow in organically. To reduce risk we would like to create a COMP pool on one chain and bootstrap the first 10,000 COMP from the treasury as bootstrapped liquidity to overcome the zero to one problem of pool creation. We will learn from the outcome the best path forward to getting COMP listed as a collateral. These initiatives are designed to deepen on-chain liquidity and reduce slippage, crucial for efficient COMP to USDC swaps.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/2d7b86bf-e1da-4850-bc9a-021c784e3bf5_original.png)\n\n\n\nThrough these structured funding requests, we aim to propel Compound into a future marked by robust growth, innovative expansion, and enhanced governance participation—all while ensuring the protocol remains a leader in the DeFi space.\n\n\n\n## Operational Process\n\n### TL; DR;  \n\nAs a business development, marketing & sales engineering organization, AlphaGrowth will continue to use the following processes and approaches to accelerate execution while working on deals involving a dozen or more stakeholders. \n\nOur base operational practices remain the same whether we are listing a new Token, Market, or Chain, each initiative has special considerations and additions to our base process. For example here is the process we’ve identified for listing Compound on a new chain <[<u>Link</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GPQYis8s_cAxvy43GOFgeXESg6VahLyVDWwMRVQ2QRE/edit#heading=h.ycec3ktzsbks)>, it involves 71 steps, 9 approval phases, and 8 organizations. Our ability to turn decentralized communities into discrete manageable processes, is what allows us to scale. \n\n\n\n## Operation Process Table of Contents\n\n1. TL; DR;  \n2. Table of Contents\n3. Our base operational process\n4. Special Considerations\n5. Marketing\n6. Software Development\n7. Appropriate Use of Funds\n8. Impact & Transparency\n\n### Base Process\n\n**Market Research**\n\n\n\nWhether launching a new chain, asset or market. Every opportunity AlphaGrowth pursues for Compound starts with extensive **market research**: Our team leverages our internal insights platform with its over 31 million on-and-off-chain data points, 108+ connected chains, and real time data ingestion & processing. Using real-time market data we identify the best potential integrations for Compound. We’ve currently tracking:\n\n1. 58,224 token projects\n2. Our network with close ties to 5,545 Dapp partners\n3. Hundreds of DEXs of which we have close relationships with 18.\n4. 50+ EVM based chains suitable for a Compound Integration\n\nWe scan for partners with deep liquidity, healthy metrics and a positive attitude toward Compound for potential collaboration. \n\n\n\n**Risk Analysis**\n\nNext we perform integration risk checks for target partners, and collaborate with risk analytics partners to identify all variables associated with adding the partner to the Compound ecosystem. \n\n**Outbounds**\n\nOnce the research and risk analytics phases are concluded, the real fun begins. Our team reaches out to shortlisted partners, pushing narrative and advocating for the partner to get involved with Compound. \n\n**Sales Engineering**\n\nAlphaGrowth works closely with both the prospective blockchains, token projects and the integration teams to analyze the viability of integration. AlphaGrowth tracks technical infrastructure requirements to be able to launch new chains, tokens & markets with Compound. We identify any blockers and architect solutions that will be carried out by our developers if the partnership advances. \n\n**Negotiation**\n\nIf a 3rd party ecosystem, treasury or dapp are involved, AlphaGrowth negotiates with the 3rd party to ensure the partnership’s success. For example, we ensure partners: \n\n1. Bootstrap pool launches by supplying sufficient Protocol Owed Liquidity.\n2. List their tokens in a timely manner and according to Compounds marketing schedule.\n3. Align incentives for win-win-win integrations. \n\n**Integration & Marketing**\n\nAlphaGrowth then collaborates closely with the teams of selected projects to ensure integration and deployment is on track. We also ensure adequate co-marketing campaigns are run with the integrating team to spread awareness for the integration\n\n\n\n### Special Considerations\n\nEach potential integration has a unique set of criteria that must be met for the opportunity to be considered a positive addition to the compound ecosystem. For Chains we target ecosystems whose goals are aligned with Compound’s and will work in the best interest of Compound to increase TVL, utility and revenue. For Tokens, we look for deep liquidity, healthy metrics and a positive attitude toward Compound for potential collaboration. For partnerships to increase TVL, we look for DeFi platforms with meaningful TVL generating potential through their existing audience and that audience’s interest in taking advantage of the opportunities Compound provides. \n\n\n\nEach partnership is different and the hundreds of conversations we’ve had for compound (and input from Gauntlet and the community) help us steer toward the best ones. \n\n\n\n### Marketing\n\nApart from the core business development activities, AlphaGrowth will also engage in auxiliary growth and marketing efforts to forward Compound’s cause. These will include:\n\n### Targeted Advertising:\n\nAlphaGrowth works with the Blockchain Ads team. Blockchain Ads has a proven record in reaching the right people in a very targeted manner, providing personalized advertising, curated based on people's on-chain behavior. Such as their most recent campaign for the Compound Academy.Blockchain Ads enables user acquisition at scale, and the ability to get Compound’s offerings in front of the owners of high value wallets.\n\n\n\nHow Blockchain Ads performs Traffic Source Stacking.\n\n1. High incentives are advertised to make participation worthwhile for big bag hodlers\n2. Blockchain-Ads target crypto enthusiasts based on their on-chain activity. \n3. Ads link DIRECTLY to a well-designed quest on Layer3.\n4. Users who click are taken straight into an interactive experience, increasing the chance of conversion.\n\n\n\nWhy a smooth experience increases conversion and retention\n\n1. They reduce friction by directing ad traffic straight to take an action through a quest. The quest format gamifies onboarding while teaching users about Compound and its partners. Completing the quest then earns rewards, solidifying the users first positive experience.\n\n### Quests:\n\nLayer3 has been very successful creating a collection of quests and streaks aimed at acquiring, onboarding, engaging, and retaining users on Compound V3, together called ‘Compound Academy’.\n\nThe quests guide users through Compound V3, Compound Extensions, and Compound Governance. \n\nThe Compound Growth program will lean into this strategy as new chains and markets are launched.\n\n### Twitter AMAs: \n\nThe AlphaGrowth team will work closely with DeFi communities to organize AMAs featuring Compound Integrations. In cases where the Compound labs team is unavailable, either a vetted Compound community member or AlphaGrowth will speak on Compound’s behalf. \n\nMarket each new opportunity for users to participate with Compound. We use tools like Blockchain Ads to target users by their wallet addresses ensuring highly relevant content is delivered to traders with the highest chance of converting (based on their historic activities). \n\n### Software Development\n\nThe Development program has 4 main areas of focus: deployment of new markets, development of new features, protocol maintenance, and consulting.\n\n\n\nWoof Software will work in tandem with AlphaGrowth to advance Compound through the continuous development of new features, community initiatives, and markets, as well as protocol maintenance, and support of external developers who want to contribute to the Compound Protocol.\n\nDuring the previous 3 months, Woof Software has trained its team with in-depth details of the Compound Protocol codebase and on-chain proposals deployment. We’ve also established working relationships with Compound Labs, OpenZeppelin, and Gauntlet to build a quick and effective development flow. Currently, Woof Software receives its requirements from the community and Compound Growth Team (AlphaGrowth).\n\n\n\n**Current projects**\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/626e67e7-2190-4844-9f41-50ca761c568a_original.png)\n\n**Development Process**\n\n\n\nThe program aims to establish long-term processes that will benefit each party involved in the delivery of new features.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/b4f48ab9-3d71-41ee-8a6a-0e8c10aed3cc_original.png)\n\n\n\n**Focus areas**\n\n* **Deployment of new markets:** Deployment of new markets with different collaterals on new and existing chains\n* **Development of new features:** On-demand development of new features like [<u>Comet Rewards V2</u>](https://www.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0xeb047900b28a9f90f3c0e65768b23e7542a65163\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=65cce2693dc7ecb321240d83\\&isRenderingProposalBody=true).\n* **Consulting:** Developers may directly reach out to the Woof Software team, or ask questions in the Discord development chat [<u>\\[see example\\]</u>](https://discord.com/channels/402910780124561410/402912055448961034/1232636590208057375). \n* **Protocol Maintenance:** Development and updating of such infrastructure components as Compound.js, updating information on aggregators like DeFi Llama, refactoring of documentation, etc.\n\n\n\n**Communication**\n\n1. **Forum:** When we start working on a project we will post an outline with estimated timelines to the forum. We will update the forum thread after each step in the outline has been achieved - as well as in case of any changes. We will reply to any questions on the forum within 2 working days.\n2. **Community calls:** We will attend all Community Calls in Discord and provide transparent updates.\n3. **Monthly Forum updates:** We will post updates about all ongoing, delivered, and planned projects during the month.**** \n\n**Deliverables:** \n\n1. Deliverables will be open-sourced and stored in the Woof Software GitHub repository.\n2. Deliverables include \n   1. Forum Discussion\n   2. Documentation\n   3. Deployment if applicable\n   4. On-chain proposal \n   5. Post-deployment support\n\n### Appropriate Use of Funds\n\nFor funds allocated as marketing fund or integration fu; AlphaGrowth will conduct a Post-program audit to list out all the expenses incurred and activities associated with these categories. Any unspent funds assigned to these Categories will be returned back to the Compound Treasury at the end of the time period of the program. With the exception of the liquidity bootstrap loans which will stay in place until the Compound Community votes them returned to the treasury. \n\n### Impact and Transparency\n\nTo align incentives for AlphaGrowth to go above and beyond. At the end of this 12-month engagement, AlphaGrowth will propose a performance bonus to be voted on by the Compound Community.  This bonus will also be a signal for AlphaGrowth to proceed and take on further responsibility within the Compound ecosystem.\n\nAt AlphaGrowth, we like doing business in public. To keep the community informed on the progress and ensure transparency, AlphaGrowth will provide: \n\n* Monthly reports on the progress of BD activities (12 reports)\n* Quarterly Progress reports highlighting various deals in the pipeline, successful integrations, closed deals, and learnings (4 reports)\n* A database that gives all the program-specific information to the community so that the members can come, verify and inquire about the process.\n* Post-program analysis and report about spends on budget categories 3,4 & 5\n* We have kept track of the [<u>130+ calls</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kZyRXWNXU-CZF-USXsOIbSQR6SVtGV5RhbiaQWlmWqQ/edit#gid=1315745627) we’ve taken on Compound’s behalf and will make our call logs available upon request \n\n\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------\n\n## **Operational Launch Process - Adding Compound to a new Chain** \n\nHey Compound Community, we’ve identified the following process to streamline approval & execution when adding Compound to a new chain. Please let us know if there is anything missing that we should add. \n\n\n\n**For Inbound Chain Requests**\n\n* Provide an application where chains to apply\n* Review the form to make sure it was done correctly, provide feedback to the chain\n\n\n\n**For Outbound Chain Requests**\n\n* AlphaGrowth identifies target chains based on their histories, TVL, etc … \n* AlphaGrowth sells the chain on a potential collaboration with Compound, requesting incentives and responsive engineers.\n* AlphaGrowth works with the chain to answer an initial pass of questions to qualify their chain as a potential candidate. \n\n\n\n**Is this a viable business opportunity?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth provides the chain’s answers to Gauntlet\n* Gauntlet provides a soft Go-No-Go\n* AlphaGrowth provides the Chain a template to post their desire to work with Compound on the Forum from their organization’s account. \n* The community waits for Gauntlet to reply on the forum that they will start their independent analysis. \n* Gauntlet’s independent analysis usually takes 1-2 weeks\n* Gauntlet Approves or Denies. This is a FINAL decision, if Gauntlet denies the opportunity stops 🛑If Gauntlet approves the opportunity continues 🟢\n\n\n\n**Does the Chain have an Oracle?** \n\n* ChainLink supports the chain → Continue to Finding Builders 🟢\n* ChainLink does NOT support the chain\n  * Chainlink says “We will never support” → Opportunity Stops 🛑\n  * ChainLink is in the process of supporting this chain → Wait & Continue 🟢\n  * ChainLink will but wants to be paid. AlphaGrowth goes to the Chain and tells them they need to pay chainlink to build the integration.\n    * The chain is unwilling to pay → Opportunity Stops 🛑\n    * The chain will pay → Wait & Continue 🟢\n* Redstone is also vetted as an oracle and can be contacted\n\n**Who will build the Compound Integration?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth finds a team to build the new chain’s Compound Integration. \n* AlphaGrowth asks for a development timeline to hold them accountable.\n\n**Who will fund the builders?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth finds a team to fund building the Compound Integration.\n* First AlphaGrowth approaches the Compound Grants Program (Questbook). \n  * AlphaGrowth shares a high level proposal\n  * If Questbook soft approves, AlphaGrowth provides a template for the development team to post their plans on the questbook public forum. \n  * If Questbook approves the funding → 🟢continue\n* If Questbook refuses to pay, AlphaGrowth tells the chain to pay for themselves\n  * If the chain says yes → 🟢continue\n* If the Chain can’t fund it, AlphaGrowth may deploy our own grant funds. At this point we need a Really Good business reason to do so. → 🟢continue\n  * If AlphaGrowth won’t fund it the opportunity stops 🛑\n* When funding is secured, move to auditing the chain. \n\n**Is the chain secure?**\n\n* AlphaGrowth asks Open Zeppelin to Audit the Blockchain/Token and submits for consideration Gauntlet’s Approval, Funding Approval & Open Zeppelin’s Template Form\n  * Open Zeppelin Rejects the Blockchain → Opportunity Stops 🛑\n  * Open Zeppelin Approves → 🟢Continue\n* Audit Approvals Received \\[Open Zeppelin & Gauntlet]\n\n**How much initial liquidity can be provided?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth meets with the compound growth DAO to negotiate how much initial liquidity they can provide on the new chain. Topics include how much liquidity the chain itself is providing. Supplied liquidity is not spent, it still belongs to the treasury and has been placed to overcome the cold start problem for the new chain. \n  * Compound Growth DAO will supply sufficient Liquidity → 🟢continue\n  * Compound Growth DAO will NOT supply sufficient Liquidity → 🟡\n    * Is there sufficient liquidity elsewhere to continue forward? \n      * Yes → 🟢continue\n      * No → 🛑stop\n* Sufficient Initial Liquidity is committed to continue\n\n**How will the new chain be accessed?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth meets with Compound Labs, provides a report of the opportunity, and asks if Compound Labs will update the Compound frontend to include the new token when the integration launches. If the pool isn’t on the front end, it’s practically unusable.\n  * Yes → 🟢continue\n  * No → 🛑stop and wait for a yes and a firm timeline. \n\n**Will the community approve?** \n\n* AlphaGrowth asks a delegate to make an On-Chain Voting Post using the Chain’s original forum post (copy-paste)\n* The Delegate publishes the On-Chain voting post\n* AlphaGrowth comments on the Chain’s original forum post informing the community that there’s an on-chain vote with the link. **Very simple post:** Update: Approved by Gauntlet, Approved by Open Zeppelin, we’re starting an on chain vote. Here’s the link.\n* The on-chain voting takes 3 days\n  * The vote fails → 🛑stop\n  * The vote Passes → 🟢continue\n* Approval is Received on-chain to build a Compound integration on Y chain\n\n**Development & Deployment** \n\n* AlphaGrowth activates the team who agreed to build the integration \n  * AlphaGrowth checks in regularly to ensure they stay on schedule\n* The Development team gets to work\n* Developers build the contracts\n* Developers Meet with Open Zeppelin and answer all OpenZeppelin’s security concerns. \n* Developers publish the contracts on test net\n* Developers ask Open Zeppelin to review the contracts after they’ve been up for a week\n* AlphaGrowth asks Open Zeppelin for an audit timeline and holds them to it. \n  * Open Zeppelin says the audit is good and the contracts look good on Testnet → 🟢continue\n  * Open Zeppelin finds problems  → 🟡slow and fix\n    * Open Zeppelin provides developer feedback, or fixes the problem themselves → changes feed back into the same approval process. ♻️\n* Open Zeppelin Approves Test Net\n* Developers Push the contracts to Mainnet\n* Open Zeppelin audits the mainnet deployment\n* Open Zeppelin approves of the mainnet deployment\n* **Compound Contracts are LIVE & Approved on Mainnet**\n\n**Launch Processes**\n\n* AlphaGrowth completes the Asset listing process \n* AlphaGrowth completes the Money Market Listing process \n* AlphGrowth prepares a Marketing & Advertising Plan\n* AlphaGrowth tell’s Compound Labs it’s time to push frontend changes adding the new chain, tokens, pools to the compound.finance website. \n* The website changes go live\n* AlphaGrowth kicks off the marketing & advertising plan",

Recently, AlphaGrowth has agreed to facilitate the OTC transaction via wintermute.\n\nThis proposal seeks guidance from the community on moving forwards with swapping and transferring the ETHW. Given community support, we will swap to either USDC or ETH and pay out a 10% white-hat bounty to Arr00.

The new parameters include setting the risk parameters based off of the [recommendations from Gauntlet](https://www.comp.xyz/t/deploy-compound-iii-on-optimism/4975/6).\n\nFurther detailed information can be found on the corresponding [deployment pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/838), [proposal pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/842), [deploy market GitHub action run](https://github.com/dmitriy-bergman-works/comet-optimism/actions/runs/8581592608) and [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/deploy-compound-iii-on-optimism/4975).\n\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThe first proposal action sets the Comet configuration and deploys a new Comet implementation on Optimism. This sends the encoded `setConfiguration` and `deployAndUpgradeTo` calls across the bridge to the governance receiver on Optimism. It also calls `setRewardConfig` on the Optimism rewards contract, to establish Optimism’s bridged version of COMP as the reward token for the deployment and set the initial supply speed to be 5 COMP/day and borrow speed to be 5 COMP/day.\n\nThe second action approves Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) [TokenMessenger](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbd3fa81b58ba92a82136038b25adec7066af3155) to take the Timelock's USDC on Mainnet, in order to seed the market reserves through the CCTP.\n\nThe third action deposits and burns 10K USDC from mainnet via depositForBurn function on CCTP’s TokenMessenger contract to mint native USDC to Comet on Optimism.\n\nThe fourth action approves Optimism’s [L1StandardBridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x99C9fc46f92E8a1c0deC1b1747d010903E884bE1) to take Timelock's COMP, in order to seed the rewards contract through the bridge.\n\nThe fifth action deposits 3.6K COMP from mainnet to the Optimism L1StandardBridge contract to bridge to CometRewards.\n\nThe sixth action updates the ENS TXT record `v3-official-markets` on `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`, updating the official markets JSON to include the new Optimism cUSDCv3 market",

Based on the last week's volume-weighted average price, this would be $75.09 per COMP for a total quarterly payment of 13,318 COMP equaling $1M per the original agreement. This COMP will be transferred from the Comptroller using `_grantComp`.\n\nMore detail in this [forum post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/openzeppelin-security-updates-for-q1-2024-q2-compensation-proposal). \n\nBy approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by OpenZeppelin shall be governed by the [Terms of Service available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eDcvirf0bdzpjIkfxQHm7fcV05O1IcLXL-Dl-U52Y4k) that were updated as of Sep 19th, 2023.",

      "title": "Initialize cUSDCv3 on Scroll",
      "content": "This proposal takes the governance steps recommended and necessary to initialize a Compound III USDC market on Scroll; upon execution, cUSDCv3 will be ready for use. Simulations have confirmed the market’s readiness, as much as possible, using the [Comet scenario suite](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/tree/main/scenario). Although real tests have also been run over the Goerli/Scroll Alpha bridge, this will be the first proposal to actually bridge from Ethereum mainnet to Scroll mainnet, and therefore includes risks not present in previous proposals.\n\nAlthough the proposal sets the entire configuration in the Configurator, with parameters based off of the [recommendations from Gauntlet](https://www.comp.xyz/t/deploy-compound-iii-on-scroll/4917/3).\n\nFurther detailed information can be found on the corresponding [proposal pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/824) and [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/deploy-compound-iii-on-scroll/4917).\n\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThe first proposal action sets the Comet configuration and deploys a new Comet implementation on Scroll. This sends the encoded `setConfiguration` and `deployAndUpgradeTo` calls across the bridge to the governance receiver on Scroll. It also calls `setRewardConfig` on the Scroll rewards contract to establish Scroll’s bridged version of COMP as the reward token for the deployment (note that rewards speeds have been set to 0, as Gauntlet has recommended to hold off on including rewards in the comet deployment for now).\n\nThe second action approves Scroll’s [L1USDCGateway](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf1AF3b23DE0A5Ca3CAb7261cb0061C0D779A5c7B) to take Timelock's USDC, in order to seed the market reserves through the bridge.\n\nThe third action deposits 10K USDC from mainnet to the Scroll L1USDCGateway contract to bridge to Comet.\n\nThe fourth action updates the ENS TXT record `v3-official-markets` on `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`, updating the official markets JSON to include the new Scroll cUSDCv3 market.",

      "title": "Aera Pilot Update",
      "content": "**Simple summary**\n\nThis proposal improves the execution and yield of the Compound Aera Vault pilot:\n\n1. Allows the vault to use Milkman from CoWSwap when trading BAT.\n    a. Liquidity conditions have severely deteriorated onchain for BAT since the initiation of this pilot, requiring additional exchange integration with Milkman in order to tap into offchain liquidity\n2. Adds cUSDCv3 as an allowed asset in the asset registry, enabling the vault to earn yield and provide liquidity to Compound with its USDC\n3. Changes the guardian address, a hygiene update for the Guardian as Gauntlet migrates some internal Guardian infrastructure\n\nThis proposal does not change the goals of the Aera pilot (diversification out of BAT and ZRX, and managing the proceeds in a volatility-targeted vault), it is simply an update to the existing vault to better enable these goals. It similarly does not change any of the security properties of Aera, the vault is still non-custodial and only the Compound DAO can withdraw/pause the vault.\n\n**Motivation**\n*Milkman*\nAfter starting the pilot, BAT has been very difficult to sell on-chain. So far the vault has been able to sell roughly $55k of BAT and there is another $57k remaining in the vault.\n\nSince the pilot program began, we have added support in Aera for CoWSwap’s Milkman contract with the goal of increasing the available liquidity for BAT swaps. This integration allows us to dynamically adjust execution price as the market price changes and taps into a network of solvers that are able to fill these orders efficiently and competitively using offchain liquidity.\n\nWe expect that this will enable the Aera Vault to swap 10x more BAT at same 100bps slippage bounds (increasing daily volume from $300-$800/day to $2k-$5k/day). Of course, this is just based on current liquidity conditions and existing solvers, and given that market liquidity is dynamic this could change.\n\n*cUSDCv3*\nWe have also heard the community’s feedback on including cUSDCv3 as an asset in the vault and allocating the existing USDC in the vault into cUSDCv3. The benefits for the DAO would be as such:\n\n1. Provide additional USDC liquidity to the Compound III ETH comet\n2. Generate yield on an otherwise idle asset in the vault\n\nIn the limited scope of the pilot, the actual need for this capital to cover insolvencies is dwarfed by the other reserves in the system (both V2 and V3 have over >$50M in reserves compared to the <$500k USDC in the pilot).\n\n[Full forum post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/proposal-aera-compound-pilot-operational-update/5003)\n\n****************************Specification****************************\n\nThis proposal will:\n1. Add new assets:\n    1. COMP, which we'll receive as rewards from lending USDC\n    2. cUSDCv3 Pricer, which prices the vault's lending position\n2. Accept ownership of new hooks module at address 0x7A8E7F9490fb927d20835b97578E521c97720f64. We need to deploy a new hooks module and have the Governor Bravo timelock accept ownership of it to get around a limitation in Governor Bravo that only 10 actions can be called in a single proposal. Without this workaround, adding the following function sighashes would put this proposal over that limit. This new hooks module already has all the existing hooks, plus the following new sighashes: \n    1. Milkman Router: `requestSell`, `cancelSell`, `claim`\n    2. BAT: `transfer`, to move the token into the Milkman swap contract\n    3. ZRX: `transfer`, to move the token into the Milkman swap contract if needed in the future\n    4. cUSDCv3: `supply` & `withdraw`\n    5. Comet Rewards: `claim`\n    6. COMP: `approve` & `transfer`, to move the token into the Milkman swap contract if needed in the future\n3. Change the guardian to our new guardian address: 0x7587D73Ec14157440c01485555F81F31cF6c549e. (The fee recipient will also change, but this is moot because fees are fixed at 0 for this pilot)\n",

Simulations have confirmed the market’s readiness, as much as possible, using the [Comet scenario suite](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/tree/main/scenario). Although real tests have also been run over the Goerli/Scroll Alpha bridge, this will be the first proposal to actually bridge from Ethereum mainnet to Scroll mainnet, and therefore includes risks not present in previous proposals.\n\nAlthough the proposal sets the entire configuration in the Configurator, with parameters based off of the [recommendations from Gauntlet](https://www.comp.xyz/t/deploy-compound-iii-on-scroll/4917/3).\n\nFurther detailed information can be found on the corresponding [proposal pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/824) and [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/deploy-compound-iii-on-scroll/4917).\n\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThe first proposal action sets the Comet configuration and deploys a new Comet implementation on Scroll. This sends the encoded `setConfiguration` and `deployAndUpgradeTo` calls across the bridge to the governance receiver on Scroll. It also calls `setRewardConfig` on the Scroll rewards contract to establish Scroll’s bridged version of COMP as the reward token for the deployment (note that rewards speeds have been set to 0, as Gauntlet has recommended to hold off on including rewards in the comet deployment for now).\n\nThe second action approves Scroll’s [L1USDCGateway](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf1AF3b23DE0A5Ca3CAb7261cb0061C0D779A5c7B) to take Timelock's USDC, in order to seed the market reserves through the bridge.\n\nThe third action deposits 10K USDC from mainnet to the Scroll L1USDCGateway contract to bridge to Comet.\n\nThe fourth action updates the ENS TXT record `v3-official-markets` on `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`, updating the official markets JSON to include the new Scroll cUSDCv3 market.",

Specifically, Gauntlet recommends the following changes:\n\n\n- Decrease **AAVE Collateral Factor** from 43% to **38%**\n- Decrease **BAT Collateral Factor** from 50% to **45%**\n- Decrease **COMP Collateral Factor** from 30% to **25%**\n- Decrease **LINK Collateral Factor** from 49% to **44%**\n- Decrease **MKR Collateral Factor** from 43% to **38%**\n- Decrease **SUSHI Collateral Factor** from 37% to **32%**\n- Decrease **YFI Collateral Factor** from 45% to **40%**\n- Decrease **ZRX Collateral Factor** from 35% to **30%**\n\nFor more details, see the full forum post [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-compound-v2-deprecation-phase-9-02-08-2024/4980).\n\n## Motivation\nIn this September 2022 snapshot vote, the community voted that each asset’s Collateral Factor may be reduced by an absolute percentage of up to 5%. After our analysis, Gauntlet recommends this max 5% decrease for each stated collateral asset in order to further deprecate the v2 market.\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-compound-v2-deprecation-phase-9-02-08-2024/4980)\n\n## Specification\nThe proposal updates the parameters using the _setCollateralFactor method of the relevant cToken contracts.\n\n<sub>By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.<sub>",

Raise Borrow APR and Supply APR rates at the kink due to sustained high utilization.\n2. Increase pre-kink USDC.e liquidity by raising the kinks.\n3. Ensure positive reserve growth beyond the kink.\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-polygon-v3-usdc-e-interest-rate-curve-recommendations-12-7-23/4864)\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal updates the IR curve parameters by using the respective methods in the `Configurator`.\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

      "title": "Compound Growth Program",
      "content": "### Summary:\n\nAlphaGrowth proposes a Compound Growth Program dedicated to advancing the Compound Protocol through targeted Business Development, Integration, and Marketing Campaigns. The program is structured with a total budget of 7770 COMP, distributed over a 4-month period and allocated into two distinct funds: BD Fund and Growth Fund.\n\nThe BD Fund is earmarked at 2760 COMP, with a monthly allocation of 690 COMP, dedicated to supporting Business Development operations for the Compound Growth Program.\n\nThe Growth Fund totaling 5010 COMP (2760 Marketing, 2250 Reserve fund), is reserved for incentivizing external parties to engage with and promote Compound in the form of Marketing campaigns and integration funding. It's important to note that AlphaGrowth operates independently of the Growth Fund and any unused portion of this fund will be returned to the Compound treasury upon the program's completion.\n\nThe forum post for the proposal can be found [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/draft-for-compound-growth-program/4582/16)\n\n### Background\n\nOur initial intentions were to manage the next cycle of the Compound grants program. However as we chatted with more delegates, it became clear that Compound needed a small grants program and a concurrent growth program to onboard new users with successive developments. A missing part in Compound's operations is the focus on growth/BD-related activities. Compound already has other areas covered thanks to reliable partners in analytics, grants, and security.\n\n* **Security:** Entrusted to OpenZeppelin.\n* **Risk:** Managed by Gauntlet.\n* **Grants:** Handled by the Compound Grants Program (CGP).\n* **Growth:** Currently unaddressed.\n\nIn many cases, ecosystems and protocols have an internal BD team to manage the growth activities. However without a dedicated team and resources to focus on growth, Compound has not been able to keep up with its competitors (like Aave). The growth program will ensure that Compound will keep up with the industry while still maintaining the conservative nature of the protocol.\n\n## **Proposal**\n\nThe Compound Growth program, a trial spanning over a period of 4 months will focus on key areas of growth for Compound Protocol. The Growth program has 2 main areas of focus, BD and Marketing. The AlphaGrowth team has spent the last 6 months discussing the growth requirements of Compound with various community members, delegates and other stakeholders. The program will be a trial run to identify the compatibility of a growth program for Compound. Additionally, this program will test several different strategies of sustainable growth for Compound.\n\n### Scope\n\n**Marketing**\n\n* Publicizing Compound Protocol: Increasing Compound’s presence in the DeFi space\n* V3 Awareness: Increase general community awareness about V3 and its benefits over V2\n* Co-marketing: For new integrations of Compound with other platforms, marketing the integration to both the communities and DeFi ecosystem at large to engage new Compound users.\n* Marketing : Paid marketing campaigns to engage new audiences\n\n**Business Development**\n\n* Increase V3 reach: Many Compound integrations are not on V3; our efforts will push more integrations from V2 to V3\n* Compound Markets: We will integrate Compound markets with a variety of new services. Wallets, Exchanges, custodians, etc.\n* dApp integration: Increasing DeFi applications that will promote activity, users and TVL.\n\n### Operations\n\nOver the period of 4 months, the Growth program will engage in the following activities:\n\n### Business Development **Targets**\n\n* V2 to V3 updating\n  * Infrastructure & Services: Applications and no code tools that ease the developer onboarding and deployment of Compound to other apps. Many of these have a V2 api/service live. Our aim will be to integrate V3 with them. Some examples include\n    * Ankr\n    * Covalent\n* Migrate Existing Pools & Increase Integrations:\n  * We will help existing integrations migrate from V2 pools to V3 Pools to increase capital efficiency\n    * Argent, which uses V2 pools\n    * [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/)\n    * Pooltogether\n* Integrating Compound onto Wallets & Exchanges\n  * New wallet integration Opportunities: Find out wallets worth integrating, focus on wallets with regional presence\n  * Integrate Centralized exchanges with Compound Markets\n    * Nexo\n    * OKX\n    * Kucoin\n* Offering Compound services to institutional custodians\n  * We will connect with Custodians that provide services to high asset individuals/organizations (Typical sales cycles for custodians are 18 Months, far beyond the trial period of the program, but a successful deal will drastically increase TVL and access to institutional capital)\n    * Hex Trust\n    * Copper\n    * Bitgo\n* Structured Products/dApp Integrations\n  * Facilitating new/existing web3 dApps that increase the use of Compound markets/pools. These are highly specific and targeted, typical key targets will be dApps serving to regional users\n    * For example - Lemon App that caters to users in LATAM\n\n**Marketing**\n\n* Compound Content Creation & Education\n  * Compound Labs (being a US-based organization) is restricted in its social media capabilities, so it cannot promote/market many activities on web3 Twitter (Apart from general information sharing through official handle). Compound as a Crypto Platform has limited presence on Social Media; No tweet storms, no widespread sharing and retweeting of information by members.\n    * Our plan is to promote key updates about Compound using multiple channels on Twitter\n    * Further, we’ll partner with DeFi KOLs to share information about Compound updates, spread the information about Compound in wider community\n* V3 Awareness and Demand Generation\n  * We’ll also facilitate steady marketing of V3. Many community members are still unaware of the V3 launch, let alone those outside of the community. We will spread the narrative of enhanced safety and other features of V3.\n    * V3 Targeted ad campaigns to compound/aave/balancer follower base\n    * Leveraging social media messaging to generate hype\n    * Co-marketing for V3 integrations with wallets, exchanges, etc.\n* Event Driven Marketing, Co-Marketing with with Partners and Integrations\n  * The team will use events as a major driving factor for the Marketing campaign. Whenever a partnership or integration occurs we will lean in and shout it from the rooftops. Co-marketing grows the pie for both the partner and Compound. We will utilize both Compound’s audience and the partner’s audience to drive adoption and exposure. Some promotion-worthy events include:\n    * Compound integration with a new dApp\n    * New asset brought to the Compound\n    * New chain integration announcement and launch\n    * New pool availability\n    * New markets on new platforms\n\n  <!---->\n\n  * Native USDC comet on Base chain - marketing extensively to Base and other L2 communities.\n  * Compound launch on Linea\n* Paid Campaigns\n  * Running multiple campaigns through various channels to promote Compound products\n    * KOL promotion: Highly targeted KOL Campaigns for DeFi users\n    * AMAs: promoting conversations with high value partners\n    * Content Sponsorships: i.e. DeFi edge with 24,000 newsletter readers\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe original growth program was to span for a period of 6 months. But as discussions on the proposal continued, a consensus was reached on starting first with a trail period. We plan the BD program to run for a time period of 4 months. The main goal of a trial is to test and experiment which activities attribute the most Compound Protocol.\n\n### Milestones and Deliverables\n\nThe program will focus on the following parameters to measure its success\n\n* Discovering the of Cost of Marketing Spend to increase $1 of TVL\n* Discovering the User Acquisition Cost per Persona (Whale +$100k, Shark $10k-100k, Minnow under $10k)\n* Discovering the User Acquisition Cost based on Integrations (Wallet, dApp, Structured Product)\n* Discovering which Integrations, Wallets, Partners drive key metrics (Fees, Transactions, Users, Volume, TVL)\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n* 1 new V3 infrastructure service provider integration\n* 1 upgrade of V3 infrastructure service provider integration\n* A minimum of 2 sponsored content posts to large audiences such as other DeFi platforms & newsletters\n* A minimum of 5 Co-Marketing campaigns with existing and new partners\n* A minimum of 3 KOL Partnerships\n* A minimum of 5 AMAs organized\n* Begin conversations with key exchanges on integration\n* Begin conversations with at least 40 dApps for integrations\n* Total at least 1,000,000 impressions for marketing campaigns\n* Minimum cumulative integrated dApp users to reach 1000\n* At least 2 new dApp integrations\n\nAs we embark on a program to enhance Compound’s growth in the aforementioned metrics, we will be trying out a number of strategies for success. Which makes this an exciting yet challenging task. Not all growth strategies will work, the key aim of the growth program in its trial period will focus on identifying and gathering data on different activities and their rates of success.\n\na) Finding out which strategies moved the needle for Compound\n\nb) what activities had the highest ROI,\n\nc) identifying the plans that were able to create desirable behavior among target user base.\n\nAt the end of the program, we will present this data to the community to evaluate the data. The community should be able to identify, what works, and what doesn’t. What challenges did the growth program encounter during operations?\n\n### Funding and Budget\n\nThe Compound Growth Program’s budget modeling is similar to Compound Grants Program. The funding ask of the growth program consists of two parts, Operational expenses and the Growth fund.\n\n**Operational Expenses**\n\nThis covers the Growth and BD activities for the program, similar to the Program manager fees on Compound Grants program. This will also include the research activities for the program. Earlier research formed a separate component of the Growth program but after taking suggestions from community members, we included it within the BD part and reduced the scope of research.\n\nThe operational expenses for the program are **690** COMP/month\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/a54a743f-ab3c-4a91-bd52-1ee1b504ce02_original.png)\n\n**Growth Fund**\n\nThe growth fund will be the primary vehicle to boost Compound’s presence in the Crypto Communities online. This is similar to the fund of CGP which will be utilized to promote growth via partners.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/b97948bd-6851-4521-96f5-eb0451d350b0_original.png)\n\n## Why AlphaGrowth\n\nWe believe decentralization allows for meritocracy. That holds true in the Compound ecosystem as well. We have firsthand experienced the problems that chains and protocols face in their expansion and integration. Our learnings will be pivotal to identifying the risks and benefits associated in various growth strategies for Compound.\n\nOperating since 2018, AlphaGrowth has years of experience in DeFi and Crypto BD, We have successfully facilitated business development for multiple protocols including Kava, Collab.Land, Sommelier Finance, NEAR, CORE, Aurora, and many others.\n\nIn our latest engagement with the Kava grants program, the Kava ecosystem witnessed new integration of 78 projects and a TVL increase of $80+ Million. Our strategies have shown resilience and success throughout the crypto winter. Over the past year, our BD efforts have led to the deployment of over 150 projects on various blockchains. AlphaGrowth gets deals done, even in the bear.\n\nWe have interacted with over 100 ecosystems and 2700+ projects. To facilitate BD and grant deployment, our team built a crypto-native CRM and dashboard enabling us to efficiently evaluate and score opportunities, and report progress on all BD efforts.\n\nWhere are here for the long haul, and are honored to have the opportunity to be Compound’s boots on the ground.\n\n### Impact and Transparency\n\nAt AlphaGrowth, we like doing business in public. We welcome any input or feedback from the Compound community on the proposal.\n\nTo keep the community informed on the progress, AG will implement the following tasks to guarantee transparency\n\n* Regular reports through Community call on the progress of BD activities\n* Progress reports highlighting various deals in the pipeline, successful integrations, closed deals and learnings (2 reports)\n* A database that gives all the program specific information to the community so that the members can come, verify and inquire about the process.\n* Post program analysis and report about spends on Development fund.\n\n### Links:\n\n[Website](https://alphagrowth.io/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alphagrowth1) | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alphagrowth/)",

      "title": "Compound Growth Program",
      "content": "### Summary:\n\nAlphaGrowth proposes a Compound Growth Program dedicated to advancing the Compound Protocol through targeted Business Development, Integration, and Marketing Campaigns. The program is structured with a total budget of 7770 COMP, distributed over a 4-month period and allocated into two distinct funds: BD Fund and Growth Fund.\n\nThe BD Fund is earmarked at 2760 COMP, with a monthly allocation of 690 COMP, dedicated to supporting Business Development operations for the Compound Growth Program.\n\nThe Growth Fund totaling 5010 COMP (2760 Marketing, 2250 Reserve fund), is reserved for incentivizing external parties to engage with and promote Compound in the form of Marketing campaigns and integration funding. It's important to note that AlphaGrowth operates independently of the Growth Fund and any unused portion of this fund will be returned to the Compound treasury upon the program's completion.\n\nThe forum post for the proposal can be found [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/draft-for-compound-growth-program/4582/16)\n\n### Background\n\nOur initial intentions were to manage the next cycle of the Compound grants program. However as we chatted with more delegates, it became clear that Compound needed a small grants program and a concurrent growth program to onboard new users with successive developments. A missing part in Compound's operations is the focus on growth/BD-related activities. Compound already has other areas covered thanks to reliable partners in analytics, grants, and security.\n\n* **Security:** Entrusted to OpenZeppelin.\n* **Risk Analytics:** Managed by Gauntlet.\n* **Grants:** Handled by the Compound Grants Program (CGP).\n* **Growth:** Currently unaddressed.\n\nIn many cases, ecosystems and protocols have an internal BD team to manage the growth activities. However without a dedicated team and resources to focus on growth, Compound has not been able to keep up with its competitors (like Aave). The growth program will ensure that Compound will keep up with the industry while still maintaining the conservative nature of the protocol.\n\n## **Proposal**\n\nThe Compound Growth program, a trial spanning over a period of 4 months will focus on key areas of growth for Compound Protocol. The Growth program has 2 main areas of focus, BD and Marketing. The AlphaGrowth team has spent the last 6 months discussing the growth requirements of Compound with various community members, delegates and other stakeholders. The program will be a trial run to identify the compatibility of a growth program for Compound. Additionally, this program will test several different strategies of sustainable growth for Compound.\n\n\n\n### Scope\n\n**Marketing**\n\n* Publicizing Compound Protocol: Increasing Compound’s presence in the DeFi space\n* V3 Awareness: Increase general community awareness about V3 and its benefits over V2\n* Co-marketing: For new integrations of Compound with other platforms, marketing the integration to both the communities and DeFi ecosystem at large to engage new Compound users.\n* Marketing : Paid marketing campaigns to engage new audiences\n\n**Business Development**\n\n* Increase V3 reach: Many Compound integrations are not on V3; our efforts will push more integrations from V2 to V3\n* Compound Markets: We will integrate Compound markets with a variety of new services. Wallets, Exchanges, custodians, etc.\n* dApp integration: Increasing DeFi applications that will promote activity, users and TVL.\n\n\n\n### Operations\n\nOver the period of 4 months, the Growth program will engage in the following activities:\n\n### Business Development **Targets**\n\n* V2 to V3 updating\n  * Infrastructure & Services: Applications and no code tools that ease the developer onboarding and deployment of Compound to other apps. Many of these have a V2 api/service live. Our aim will be to integrate V3 with them. Some examples include\n    * Ankr\n    * Covalent\n* Migrate Existing Pools & Increase Integrations:\n  * We will help existing integrations migrate from V2 pools to V3 Pools to increase capital efficiency\n    * Argent, which uses V2 pools\n    * [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com)\n    * Pooltogether\n* Integrating Compound onto Wallets & Exchanges\n  * New wallet integration Opportunities: Find out wallets worth integrating, focus on wallets with regional presence\n  * Integrate Centralized exchanges with Compound Markets\n    * Nexo\n    * OKX\n    * Kucoin\n* Offering Compound services to institutional custodians\n  * We will connect with Custodians that provide services to high asset individuals/organizations (Typical sales cycles for custodians are 18 Months, far beyond the trial period of the program, but a successful deal will drastically increase TVL and access to institutional capital)\n    * Hex Trust\n    * Copper\n    * Bitgo\n* Structured Products/dApp Integrations\n  * Facilitating new/existing web3 dApps that increase the use of Compound markets/pools. These are highly specific and targeted, typical key targets will be dApps serving to regional users\n    * For example - Lemon App that caters to users in LATAM\n\n**Marketing**\n\n* Compound Content Creation & Education\n  * Compound Labs (being a US-based organization) is restricted in its social media capabilities, so it cannot promote/market many activities on web3 Twitter (Apart from general information sharing through official handle). Compound as a Crypto Platform has limited presence on Social Media; No tweet storms, no widespread sharing and retweeting of information by members.\n    * Our plan is to promote key updates about Compound using multiple channels on Twitter\n    * Further, we’ll partner with DeFi KOLs to share information about Compound updates, spread the information about Compound in wider community\n* V3 Awareness and Demand Generation\n  * We’ll also facilitate steady marketing of V3. Many community members are still unaware of the V3 launch, let alone those outside of the community. We will spread the narrative of enhanced safety and other features of V3.\n    * V3 Targeted ad campaigns to compound/aave/balancer follower base\n    * Leveraging social media messaging to generate hype\n    * Co-marketing for V3 integrations with wallets, exchanges, etc.\n* Event Driven Marketing, Co-Marketing with with Partners and Integrations\n  * The team will use events as a major driving factor for the Marketing campaign. Whenever a partnership or integration occurs we will lean in and shout it from the rooftops. Co-marketing grows the pie for both the partner and Compound. We will utilize both Compound’s audience and the partner’s audience to drive adoption and exposure. Some promotion-worthy events include:\n    * Compound integration with a new dApp\n    * New asset brought to the Compound\n    * New chain integration announcement and launch\n    * New pool availability\n    * New markets on new platforms\n\n  <!---->\n\n  * Native USDC comet on Base chain - marketing extensively to Base and other L2 communities.\n  * Compound launch on Linea\n* Paid Campaigns\n  * Running multiple campaigns through various channels to promote Compound products\n    * KOL promotion: Highly targeted KOL Campaigns for DeFi users\n    * AMAs: promoting conversations with high value partners\n    * Content Sponsorships: i.e. DeFi edge with 24,000 newsletter readers\n\n**Timeline**\n\nThe original growth program was to span for a period of 6 months. But as discussions on the proposal continued, a consensus was reached on starting first with a trail period. We plan the BD program to run for a time period of 4 months. The main goal of a trial is to test and experiment which activities attribute the most Compound Protocol.\n\n\n\n### Milestones and Deliverables\n\nThe program will focus on the following parameters to measure its success\n\n* Discovering the of Cost of Marketing Spend to increase $1 of TVL\n* Discovering the User Acquisition Cost per Persona (Whale +$100k, Shark $10k-100k, Minnow under $10k)\n* Discovering the User Acquisition Cost based on Integrations (Wallet, dApp, Structured Product)\n* Discovering which Integrations, Wallets, Partners drive key metrics (Fees, Transactions, Users, Volume, TVL)\n\n**Deliverables**\n\n* 1 new V3 infrastructure service provider integration\n* 1 upgrade of V3 infrastructure service provider integration\n* A minimum of 2 sponsored content posts to large audiences such as other DeFi platforms & newsletters\n* A minimum of 5 Co-Marketing campaigns with existing and new partners\n* A minimum of 3 KOL Partnerships\n* A minimum of 5 AMAs organized\n* Begin conversations with key exchanges on integration\n* Begin conversations with at least 40 dApps for integrations\n* Total at least 1,000,000 impressions for marketing campaigns\n* Minimum cumulative integrated dApp users to reach 1000\n* At least 2 new dApp integrations\n\nAs we embark on a program to enhance Compound’s growth in the aforementioned metrics, we will be trying out a number of strategies for success. Which makes this an exciting yet challenging task. Not all growth strategies will work, the key aim of the growth program in its trial period will focus on identifying and gathering data on different activities and their rates of success.\n\na) Finding out which strategies moved the needle for Compound\n\nb) what activities had the highest ROI,\n\nc) identifying the plans that were able to create desirable behavior among target user base.\n\nAt the end of the program, we will present this data to the community to evaluate the data. The community should be able to identify, what works, and what doesn’t. What challenges did the growth program encounter during operations?\n\n\n\n### Funding and Budget\n\nThe Compound Growth Program’s budget modeling is similar to Compound Grants Program. The funding ask of the growth program consists of two parts, Operational expenses and the Growth fund.\n\n**Operational Expenses**\n\nThis covers the Growth and BD activities for the program, similar to the Program manager fees on Compound Grants program. This will also include the research activities for the program. Earlier research formed a separate component of the Growth program but after taking suggestions from community members, we included it within the BD part and reduced the scope of research.\n\nThe operational expenses for the program are **690** COMP/month\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/a54a743f-ab3c-4a91-bd52-1ee1b504ce02_original.png)\n\n**Growth Fund**\n\nThe growth fund will be the primary vehicle to boost Compound’s presence in the Crypto Communities online. This is similar to the fund of CGP which will be utilized to promote growth via partners.\n\n![](https://static.tally.xyz/b97948bd-6851-4521-96f5-eb0451d350b0_original.png)\n\n\n\n## Why AlphaGrowth\n\nWe believe decentralization allows for meritocracy. That holds true in the Compound ecosystem as well. We have firsthand experienced the problems that chains and protocols face in their expansion and integration. Our learnings will be pivotal to identifying the risks and benefits associated in various growth strategies for Compound.\n\nOperating since 2018, AlphaGrowth has years of experience in DeFi and Crypto BD, We have successfully facilitated business development for multiple protocols including Kava, Collab.Land, Sommelier Finance, NEAR, CORE, Aurora, and many others.\n\nIn our latest engagement with the Kava grants program, the Kava ecosystem witnessed new integration of 78 projects and a TVL increase of $80+ Million. Our strategies have shown resilience and success throughout the crypto winter. Over the past year, our BD efforts have led to the deployment of over 150 projects on various blockchains. AlphaGrowth gets deals done, even in the bear.\n\nWe have interacted with over 100 ecosystems and 2700+ projects. To facilitate BD and grant deployment, our team built a crypto-native CRM and dashboard enabling us to efficiently evaluate and score opportunities, and report progress on all BD efforts.\n\nWhere are here for the long haul, and are honored to have the opportunity to be Compound’s boots on the ground.\n\n### Impact and Transparency\n\nAt AlphaGrowth, we like doing business in public. We welcome any input or feedback from the Compound community on the proposal.\n\nTo keep the community informed on the progress, AG will implement the following tasks to guarantee transparency\n\n* Regular reports through Community call on the progress of BD activities\n* Progress reports highlighting various deals in the pipeline, successful integrations, closed deals and learnings (2 reports)\n* A database that gives all the program specific information to the community so that the members can come, verify and inquire about the process.\n* Post program analysis and report about spends on Development fund.\n\n\n\n### Links:\n\n[Website](https://alphagrowth.io/) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alphagrowth1) | [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alphagrowth/)",

      "content": "### **Summary**\n\nAfter [successfully running CGP 2.0](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) for two quarters and taking into consideration its impact, Questbook proposes to renew [Compound Grants Program 2.0](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136)  with a budget of $970,000 = 20,847 COMP (calculated based on the most recent COMP price at the time of proposal submission, which was $46.53), spread across three domains. Questbook has received great feedback from the community, builders and domain allocators to renew the grants Compound Grants and are grateful for their valuable inputs.\n\nFor more details, see the full forum discussion here: <https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-updates-and-renewal/4518/44>.\n\n### **Background  and Progress**\n\nCGP 2.0 went live on [Jan, 2023](https://twitter.com/compoundgrants/status/1614931948354535426?s=20) with a [grants budget of $800k](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136#:~:text=The%20grant%20budget%20is%20%24800K) spread across four domains. Over the past two quarters, CGP 2.0 domain allocators approved proposals requesting [$670,000 in grants](https://www.questbook.app/) and disbursed a total of ~$410,000 to accepted proposals from a pool of 100+ proposals. These domain allocators [**were elected from the community and by the community.**](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) The specific information regarding the accepted proposals and the funded teams can be found [here](https://www.questbook.app/). Detailed information related to CGP 2.0’s funding breakdown, relevant metrics, insights, and proposed improvements going forward can be found [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-updates-and-renewal/4518/44?u=harsha).\n\n### **Proposal**\n\nBased on the impact and insights derived from CGP 2.0, we propose renewing CGP 2.0 with a budget of $970k for two quarters. The domain allocators will utilize this budget to fund proposals that align with Compound's roadmap. After researching, gathering feedback from domain allocators, active community members, and builders, we propose supporting the following domains:\n\n![Budget](https://i.imgur.com/YuDEz0G.png)\n\n**RFPs, acceptance criteria and specifications for each domain**\n\n1. Dapps and Protocol Ideas - [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sre0LAkHEBQ1Rzhycbk3ALM3XBHF8NlXgl8tO5aVNWg/edit?usp=sharing)\n2. Multi - Chain/Cross chain Strategy, Dev Tooling - [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QjT3UDNoTq4o0-xqYJVh-WB4X1EKS5eoVgOGZnw7k60/edit?usp=sharing)\n3. Security Tooling - [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uEGIIK_eu_c008sJ_GY2nr9Bnjqq4p8dxnFKzvLLeYw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n* Given that [Dapps and New Protocol Ideas](https://www.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0xeb047900b28a9f90f3c0e65768b23e7542a65163\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=0x36a) domain received more than twice the number of proposals compared to all the other domains combined, we propose merging Multi-chain and Cross-chain Strategy domain with the Dev Tooling domain.\n* Additionally, we propose increasing the allocated grants budget for Dapps and New Protocol Ideas domain to $450,000 and reducing the grants budget of the [Security Tooling domain](https://www.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x291d6eb5de3b023ce9b760ef251b303c0c0fd11a\\&chainId=10\\&role=community\\&proposalId=0x33b) to $150,000 taking into consideration the number of proposals and allocated grant amounts for both domains during [CGP 2.0](https://www.questbook.app/).\n\n### Specifications and Implementation\n\nSimilar to the model implemented in CGP 2.0, the renewed grants program will be run using [**Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model**](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/). Each *domain allocator* will run their respective domain on-chain for full transparency using Questbook. Additional details related to specifications and implementation be found [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-updates-and-renewal/4518/44?u=harsha).\n\n### Compensation\n\nSourcing, reviewing, funding, marketing, tracking and nurturing proposals requires **significant expertise and time commitment** from the grants committee members and they should be fairly and competitively compensated for their efforts. Based on the learnings from CGP 2.0 specified above, we believe that a Program Manager is expected to dedicate approximately 25 hours per week, while the domain allocator is required to allocate an estimated 15 hours per week. However, these time commitments may vary depending on the number of proposals received for a domain and the domain allocators may exceed or work for less than 15 hours per week based on the proposal volumes. We propose keeping the hourly price the same for the Domain Allocators and the Program Manager as in the case of CGP 2.0.\n\n![Compensation](https://i.imgur.com/gNxavbs.png)\n\n* Questbook will provide the grants committee its grants orchestration tool free of cost.  We suggest that the grants committee continue with [Synapse](https://www.synaps.io/) for KYC services and [Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/en-in) for all contractual agreements, as we have been using these services throughout CGP 2.0.\n* However, for any specific asks from the grants team in order to run the process more smoothly, Questbook will charge for any additional feature requests based on the development overhead through a retrospective grant from Compound.\n\n**All unallocated funds from the first iteration of CGP 2.0** [**have been returned back**](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x295fcc65d4704a09ea0146e127e29c869b67198d9ff87f4fee1d9a17733a1f39) **to the Compound treasury**\n\nThe **KPIs, CGP 2.0 funding overview, expectations** of the proposed renewal program along with the **responsibilities of the Domain Allocators and the Program Manager** can be found [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-updates-and-renewal/4518/44?u=harsha).\n\n### **About Questbook**\n\n* Questbook (YC-W21) is a decentralized grant orchestration tool, currently being used by Polygon, AAVE, Celo & Solana.\n* Considering the achievements of CGP 2.0, as well as the time commitment and operational expertise necessary for running an effective grants program, Questbook will continue in the role of the Program Manager. [Ruchil](https://twitter.com/roohchill) from Questbook will assume the responsibilities of the Program Manager in place of Sriharsha Karamchati due to bandwidth constraints. [Ruchil](https://twitter.com/roohchill) was the program manager for Polygon facilitating the disbursal of ~ $1M in grants. He works with Solana foundation and ecosystems within Solana on a daily basis to help them design their grants program. He has received a grant of $250K from the Solana foundation for the same. He also worked closely with CGP 2.0 Program Manager and Grants team.\n\n### **Disclaimer**\n\nQuestbook has been collaborating with Michigan Blockchain to work through the details of this grant renewal proposal and communicate the merits to the broader Compound community. Michigan Blockchain was not provided consideration as a result of this collaboration as both proposers believe the passing of this proposal is in the best interest of the Compound protocol.",

      "content": "**Simple summary**\n\nA proposal from Aera to initiate a free $500k pilot to diversify out of ZRX and BAT reserves (from Compound V2 ETH) and then hold the proceeds in a Volatility targeted portfolio.\n\nThe vault will do the following:\n\n- Sell out of ZRX and BAT over time using onchain execution venues which minimizes onchain slippage\n    - The initial allocation will be 80% ZRX and 20% BAT, this allocation was chosen due to onchain liquidity conditions.\n- The proceeds of which will be then managed in a Volatility targeted vault consisting of wstETH and USDC.\n    - The target will be 15% portfolio volatility of the wstETH and USDC holdings\n\nKey features\n\n- This is a non custodial vault, where the Compound Governor Bravo Timelock is the owner of the vault (and thus governance votes can initiate withdraw/deposit requests at any time)\n- Gauntlet will be the vault guardian for this vault\n\nFor more details see the forum post [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/aera-pilot-for-compound-v2-reserves/4655).\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe Compound v2 market on Ethereum has accumulated over $45m of reserves, including USD stablecoins, WBTC, ETH, BAT, and 0x, among others. These reserves are static and do not help the DAO future proof its reserve needs particularly because there is higher than necessary exposure to long tail assets such as BAT and 0x. With the launch of Aera, there is now a purpose-built solution that simplifies and automates much of this optimization.\n\nA few key benefits for Compound:\n\n- Aera helps to minimize bureaucracy. The DAO doesn’t need to plan strategies, but rather just pick assets.\n- The Aera protocol regularly rebalances Compound’s portfolio based on market conditions.\n- Aera is non-custodial - the DAO is in control of it’s assets.\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/aera-pilot-for-compound-v2-reserves/4655)\n\n****************************Specification****************************\n\nThis proposal will \n\n1. acceptOwnership of the Aera vault, Hooks module, and Asset Registry\n2. _reduceReserves on both ZRX and BAT V2 reserves\n3. approve spending on these tokens to allow them to be deposited to the Aera vault\n4. deposit into the Aera vault\n5. resume the Aera vault, allowing the guardian to start rebalancing",

      "content": "Using stMATIC as a collateral asset has added significant value on other lending platforms like Aave v3 (Polygon) and a popular leveraged staking strategy increasing utilization rates for MATIC. For Compound, stMATIC offers a good collateral option because of its extensive use and composability on Polygon.\n\n ## stMATIC - Key Reasons to List on Compound\n\n stMATIC is deeply integrated with DeFI projects such as Aave and Balancer.\n stMATIC TVL has grown to 135M+ MATIC steadily ever since its launch.\n There is 40M+ stMATIC on Polygon that haven't been deployed on DeFi yet, which offers a large TVL opportunity for Compound\n\n ## Proposed Parameters\n\n Liquidity - stMATIC currently has a TVL of 135M+ MATIC staked.\n This proposal is to set the parameters for stMATIC as below based on [Gauntlet's  recommendations](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-recommendations-stmatic-and-stmatic-listing-on-polygon-compound-v3/4397)\n supplyCap: 8,000,000\n borrowCollateralFactor: 60%\n liquidateCollateralFactor: 65%\n liquidationFactor: 7%\n The proposal is to be made from [this pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/808/files)\n\n ## Background - stMATIC\n\n Lido on Polygon staking solution for Polygon is stMATIC, a liquid staking solution for MATIC. Lido on Polygon lets users earn MATIC staking rewards and also enables users to participate in other Defi protocols using stMATIC while accruing rewards.\n stMATIC is a token that represents your share of the total MATIC pool deposited with Lido on Polygon. As soon as you deposit MATIC on the Lido on Polygon smart contract, you receive newly minted stMATIC, based on the exchange rate at the time of staking. As the MATIC rewards get added the value of stMATIC increases.\n\n Lido on Polygon for Polygon gives you\n Liquidity through tokenization\n Ease of staking\n stMATIC is the only solution that allows users to natively stake their MATIC on Polygon, allowing users to take advantage of the low transaction fee\n\n ## stMATIC Security:\n\n Lido on Polygon protocol contracts are dual audited:\n\n [Here](https://github.com/lidofinance/polygon-contracts/tree/main/audits) is the link to the Audits\n Lido on Polygon contracts for stMATIC are controlled by a multi-sig account (0xd65Fa54F8DF43064dfd8dDF223A446fc638800A9) managed by (Shardlabs, Lido and Polygon).

The specific distributions allow for an equilibrium USDC utilization to be reached given the current collateral asset supply caps.\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-arbitrum-v3-usdc-reward-recommendations-2023-09-14/4673)\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal updates the COMP supply rewards on the Arbitrum USDC Native Comet using the `setBaseTrackingSupplySpeed` method of the Arbitrum Configurator contract.\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

      "content": "## Background\n\nSince 2021, Gauntlet has worked with Compound to maximize the protocol’s capital efficiency given an acceptable level of market risk.\n\nFull details of the proposal can be found [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-compound-renewal-2023/4638).\n\n## Proposal\n\nA proposal to renew Gauntlet’s 12-month engagement with Compound on continuous market risk management to maximize capital efficiency while minimizing the risk of insolvency and liquidations to create long-term sustainable growth. Gauntlet renewed its partnership with Compound last year in September, which runs through September 27, 2023.\n\nGauntlet’s Risk Management platform quantifies risk, optimizes risk parameters, runs economic stress tests, and calibrates parameters dynamically. Gauntlet uses agent-based simulation models tuned to actual market data to model tail market events and interactions between different users within DeFi protocols. Compared to Gauntlet’s [2022 engagement](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-compound-renewal/3541), the proposed 2023 renewal has broader coverage of 15 comet deployments and a simpler, more predictable fixed fee structure that is aligned with Compound’s multi-chain vision.\n\nThe service fee structure will be a fixed annual fee of $2,000,000, completely in COMP tokens. Using COMP token’s 30-day VWAP price as of EOD Sep 12, which is $42.58, the total COMP token amount for the fixed fee will be 46,970 COMP tokens. 30% (14,091 COMP tokens) will be sent as a lump sum to the insolvency refund vault (0x7667095Caa12b79fCa489ff6E2198Ca01fDAe057), and 70% (32,879 COMP tokens) will be streamed linearly over the course of the year, with the start date of Sep 27, to Gauntlet's address (0xD20c9667bf0047F313228F9fE11F8b9F8Dc29bBa).\n\nIn order to facilitate these payments, we transfer 46,970 COMP to the timelock using the `_grantComp` method on the `Comptroller`.\n\nTo increase its alignment with Compound, Gauntlet will refund a portion of the payment should Gauntlet's risk parameter optimizations incur losses for the protocol during the engagement. For more details, see the full [proposal](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-compound-renewal-2023/4638).\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

      "content": "Using stMATIC as a collateral asset has added significant value on other lending platforms like Aave v3 (Polygon) and a popular leveraged staking strategy increasing utilization rates for MATIC. For Compound, stMATIC offers a good collateral option because of its extensive use and composability on Polygon.\n\n ## stMATIC - Key Reasons to List on Compound\n\n stMATIC is deeply integrated with DeFI projects such as Aave and Balancer.\n stMATIC TVL has grown to 135M+ MATIC steadily ever since its launch.\n There is 40M+ stMATIC on Polygon that haven't been deployed on DeFi yet, which offers a large TVL opportunity for Compound\n\n ## Proposed Parameters\n\n Liquidity - stMATIC currently has a TVL of 135M+ MATIC staked.\n This proposal is to set the parameters for stMATIC as below based on [Gauntlet's  recommendations](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-recommendations-stmatic-and-stmatic-listing-on-polygon-compound-v3/4397)\n supplyCap: 8,000,000\n borrowCollateralFactor: 60%\n liquidateCollateralFactor: 65%\n liquidationFactor: 7%\n The proposal is to be made from [this pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/808/files)\n\n ## Background - stMATIC\n\n Lido on Polygon staking solution for Polygon is stMATIC, a liquid staking solution for MATIC. Lido on Polygon lets users earn MATIC staking rewards and also enables users to participate in other Defi protocols using stMATIC while accruing rewards.\n stMATIC is a token that represents your share of the total MATIC pool deposited with Lido on Polygon. As soon as you deposit MATIC on the Lido on Polygon smart contract, you receive newly minted stMATIC, based on the exchange rate at the time of staking. As the MATIC rewards get added the value of stMATIC increases.\n\n Lido on Polygon for Polygon gives you\n Liquidity through tokenization\n Ease of staking\n stMATIC is the only solution that allows users to natively stake their MATIC on Polygon, allowing users to take advantage of the low transaction fee\n\n ## stMATIC Security:\n\n Lido on Polygon protocol contracts are dual audited:\n\n [Here](https://github.com/lidofinance/polygon-contracts/tree/main/audits) is the link to the Audits\n Lido on Polygon contracts for stMATIC are controlled by a multi-sig account (0xd65Fa54F8DF43064dfd8dDF223A446fc638800A9) managed by (Shardlabs, Lido and Polygon).

      "content": "This proposal takes the governance steps recommended and necessary to initialize a Compound III USDC (native USDC on Arbitrum) market on Arbitrum; upon execution, cUSDCv3 will be ready for use. Simulations have confirmed the market’s readiness, as much as possible, using the [Comet scenario suite](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/tree/main/scenario). Although real tests have also been run over the Goerli/Arbitrum Goerli, this will be the first proposal to mint native USDC on Arbitrum mainnet by burning USDC on mainnet via the `depositAndBurn` function on the Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) provided by Circle, and therefore includes risks not present in previous proposals.\n\nThe proposal sets the entire configuration in the Configurator to be the same as the existing bridged USDC.e market. Finally, the parameters include a migration of bridged USDC.e market supply-side COMP incentives to users in the new native USDC market.\n\nFurther detailed information can be found on the corresponding [proposal pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/789) and [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/initialize-compound-iii-native-usdc-on-arbitrum/4542).\n\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThe first proposal action sets the Comet Factory, Comet configuration and deploys a new Comet implementation on Arbitrum. This sends the encoded `setFactory`, `setConfiguration` and `deployAndUpgradeTo` calls across the bridge to the governance receiver on Arbitrum. It also calls `setRewardConfig` on the Arbitrum rewards contract, to establish Arbitrum’s bridged version of COMP as the reward token for the deployment and set the initial supply speed to be 10 COMP/day and borrow speed to be 0 COMP/day. It calls another `setBaseTrackingSupplySpeed` and `setBaseTrackingBorrowSpeed` to set the supply speed and borrow speed of the existing USDC.e market to be 0 COMP/day. Lastly it calls `deployAndUpgradeTo` to deploy an updated Comet implementation for the existing bridged USDC.e market to have the new supply and borrow rewards speed.\n\nThe second action approves Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)[TokenMessenger](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbd3fa81b58ba92a82136038b25adec7066af3155) to take the Timelock's USDC on Mainnet, in order to seed the market reserves through the CCTP.\n\nThe third action deposits and burns 10K USDC from mainnet via `depositForBurn` function on CCTP’s TokenMessenger contract to mint native USDC to Comet on Arbitrum.\n\nThe fourth action updates the ENS TXT record `v3-official-markets` on `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`, updating the official markets JSON to include the new native USDC market and renames the bridged USDC market’s baseSymbol to USDC.e from USDC.",

      "title": "CGP 2.0 Updates and Renewal",
      "content": "### **Summary**\n\nAfter [successfully running CGP 2.0](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) for two quarters and taking into consideration its impact, Questbook proposes to renew [Compound Grants Program 2.0](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) with a budget of $970,000 = 17,436.7 COMP (calculated as per the most recent COMP price at the time of proposal submission: $55.6) spread across 3 domains. Questbook has received great feedback from the community, builders and domain allocators to renew [CGP 2.0](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/3352) and are grateful for their valuable inputs.\n\nFor more details, see the full forum discussion here: https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-updates-and-renewal/4518\n\n### **Background and Progress of CGP 2.0**\n\nCGP 2.0 went live in [Jan, 2023](https://twitter.com/compoundgrants/status/1614931948354535426?s=20) with a [grants budget of $800k](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) spread across four domains. Over the past two quarters, CGP 2.0 domain allocators approved proposals requesting ~ [$670,000 in grants](https://www.questbook.app/) and disbursed a total of ~$326,000 to accepted proposals from a pool of 100+ proposals. These domain allocators [were elected from the community and by the community.](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/136) The specific information regarding the accepted and funded proposals can be found [here](https://www.questbook.app/) . Detailed information related to CGP 2.0’s funding breakdown, relevant metrics, insights, and proposed improvements going forward can be found [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-updates-and-renewal/4518)\n\n### Renewal **Proposal**\n\nBased on the impact and insights derived from CGP 2.0, we propose renewing CGP 2.0 with a budget of $970k for two quarters. The domain allocators will utilize this budget to fund proposals that align with Compound’s roadmap. After researching, gathering feedback from domain allocators, active community members, and builders, we propose supporting the following domains:\n\n![domains](https://i.imgur.com/YuDEz0G.png)\n\n- Given that [Dapps and New Protocol Ideas](https://www.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0xeb047900b28a9f90f3c0e65768b23e7542a65163&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=0x36a) domain received more than twice the number of proposals compared to all the other domains combined, we propose merging Multi-chain and Cross-chain Strategy domain with the Dev Tooling domain.\n- Additionally, we propose increasing the allocated grants budget for Dapps and New Protocol Ideas domain to $450,000 and reducing the grants budget of the [Security Tooling domain](https://www.questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x291d6eb5de3b023ce9b760ef251b303c0c0fd11a&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=0x33b) to $150,000 taking into consideration the number of proposals and allocated grant amounts for both domains during [CGP 2.0](https://www.questbook.app/) .\n\n### Specifications and Implementation\n\nSimilar to the model implemented in [CGP 2.0](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/3352/82), the renewed grants program will be run using **[Delegated Domain Capital Allocation Model](https://blog.questbook.xyz/posts/min-grants-dao-max-community-participation/)**. Each *domain allocator* will run their respective domain on-chain for full transparency using Questbook. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible to the community. Additional details related to specifications and implementation be found [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-updates-and-renewal/4518).\n\n![img](https://questbook.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fglobal.discourse-cdn.com%2Fstandard17%2Fuploads%2Fcompoundcommunity%2Foptimized%2F2X%2F9%2F93e2b9cf473cd9e1756cc02b59d51c05572baf35_2_690x299.jpeg?table=block&id=8ab8d94c-19b7-4fee-a207-2d5e08dcf2f8&spaceId=a286e6c7-2514-47c8-a776-44b02bb2aa86&width=1380&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n### Compensation\n\nSourcing, reviewing, funding, marketing, tracking and nurturing proposals requires **significant expertise and time commitment** from the grants committee members and they should be fairly and competitively compensated for their efforts. Based on the learnings from CGP 2.0 specified above, we believe that a Program Manager is expected to dedicate approximately 25 hours per week, while the domain allocator is required to allocate an estimated 15 hours per week. However, these time commitments may vary depending on the number of proposals received for a domain and the domain allocators may exceed or work for less than 15 hours per week based on the proposal volumes. We propose keeping the hourly price the same for the Domain Allocators and the Program Manager as in the case of CGP 2.0\n\n![compensation](https://i.imgur.com/gNxavbs.png)\n\n- Questbook will provide the grants committee its grants orchestration tool free of cost. We suggest that the grants committee continue with [Synapse](https://www.synaps.io/) for KYC services, [Docusign](https://www.docusign.com/en-in) for all contractual agreements, and [BLG](https://twitter.com/BlockchainLG) - Blockchain Lawyers Group for all contractual agreements as we have been using these services throughout CGP 2.0.\n- However, for any specific asks from the grants team in order to run the process more smoothly, Questbook will charge for any additional feature requests based on the development overhead through a retrospective grant proposal from Compound at the end of two quarters.\n\n[CGP 2.0 Funding Overview](https://www.notion.so/CGP-2-0-Funding-Overview-1455f8dfb7bc43e585161b7b06481284?pvs=21)\n\n- Considering the funding breakdown and COMP’s price on August 10th, 2023, **~$400,000 will be reserved** from the CGP 2.0 budget’s available funds. This allocation will be utilised to fulfill the milestone payout obligations for accepted proposals and committee compensation for the month of August. Unallocated funds from the [Grants SAFE](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/3352/54?u=harsha) and all domain level SAFE will be returned back to the treasury.\n- The unallocated funds from every domain will be returned to the treasury from the renewal budget at the end of 2 quarters\n\nThe **KPIs and expectations** of the proposed renewal program along with the **responsibilities of the Domain Allocators and the Program Manager** can be found [here.](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-updates-and-renewal/4518)\n\n### **About Questbook**\n\n- Questbook (YC-W21) is a decentralized grant orchestration tool, currently being/previously used by Polygon, AAVE, Celo, Solana, TON, Aleph Zero etc.\n- Considering the achievements of CGP 2.0, as well as the time commitment and operational expertise necessary for running an effective grants program, Questbook will continue in the role of the Program Manager. [Ruchil](https://twitter.com/roohchill) from Questbook will assume the responsibilities of the Program Manager in place of [@harsha](https://www.comp.xyz/u/harsha) due to bandwidth constraints. Ruchil was the program manager for Polygon facilitating the disbursal of ~ $1M in grants. He works with Solana foundation and ecosystems within Solana on a daily basis to help them design their grants program. He has received a grant of $250K from the Solana foundation for the same. He also worked closely with CGP 2.0 Program Manager and Grants team.\n\n### **Disclaimer**\n\nQuestbook has been collaborating with Michigan Blockchain to work through the details of this grant renewal proposal and communicate the merits to the broader Compound community. Michigan Blockchain was not provided consideration as a result of this collaboration as both proposers believe the passing of this proposal is in the best interest of the Compound protocol.\n",

      "content": "This proposal takes the governance steps recommended and necessary to initialize a Compound III WETH market on Base; upon execution, cWETHv3 will be ready for use. Simulations have confirmed the market’s readiness, as much as possible, using the [Comet scenario suite](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/tree/main/scenario).\n\nAlthough the proposal sets the entire configuration in the Configurator, the initial deployment already has most of these same parameters already set. The new parameters include setting the risk parameters based off of the [recommendations from Gauntlet for Base](https://www.comp.xyz/t/deploy-compound-iii-on-base/4402/2) as well as their [latest recommendations for the WETH market](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-recommendations-ethereum-compound-v3-eth-risk-parameter-ir-curve-incentive-changes-8-4-23/4565). Finally, the parameters include a modest reallocation of some of the v2 USDC borrow-side COMP incentives to users in the new market.\n\nFurther detailed information can be found on the corresponding [proposal pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/794) and [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/deploy-compound-iii-on-base/4402).\n\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThe first proposal action sends a cross-chain message to Base, triggering a series of actions. These actions are to set the CometFactory for the new Comet, set the Comet configuration, deploy a new Comet implementation, set COMP as the reward token for the deployment, wrap some ETH to WETH, and transfer WETH to the cWETHv3 contract as initial reserves. The initial supply speed will be 20 COMP/day and borrow speed will be 0 COMP/day.\n\nThe second action bridges 10 ETH from the mainnet Timelock to the Base Timelock, to be wrapped as WETH and seeded as initial reserves to the cWETHv3 market.\n\nThe third action updates the ENS TXT record `v3-official-markets` on `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`, updating the official markets JSON to include the new Base cUSDbCv3 market.\n\nThe fourth action reduces the COMP distribution to v2 cUSDC borrowers by 20 COMP/day, so as to keep the total COMP distribution constant.",

      "title": "Add MaticX as Collateral to USDCv3 Polygon Market",
      "content": "Using MaticX as a collateral asset has added significant value on other lending platforms like Aave v3 (Polygon) and a popular leveraged staking strategy increasing utilization rates for MATIC. For Compound, MaticX offers a good collateral option because of its extensive use and composability on Polygon.\n\n ## MaticX - Key Reasons to List on Compound\n\n MaticX is deeply integrated with DeFI projects such as Aave and Balancer.\n There is $10M+ liquidity in MaticX based pools cross leading DEXs\n ~35M MaticX supplied on Aave against supply cap of 38M MaticX. Proposal to enhance supply cap to 50.6M MaticX underway.\n MaticX TVL has grown to 84M+ MATIC steadily ever since its launch in Apr’22.\n There is 20M+ MaticX on Polygon that haven't been deployed on DeFi yet, which offers a large TVL opportunity for Compound\n\n ## Proposed Parameters\n\n Liquidity - MaticX currently has a TVL of 84M+ MATIC staked and total liquidity of $10M+ in MaticX based liquidity pools on ecosystem DEXs with Balancer being the lead along with QuickSwap & MeshSwap.\n This proposal is to set the parameters for MaticX as below based on [Gauntlet's  recommendations](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-recommendations-stmatic-and-maticx-listing-on-polygon-compound-v3/4397)\n supplyCap: 6,000,000\n borrowCollateralFactor: 55%\n liquidateCollateralFactor: 60%\n liquidationFactor: 93%\n The proposal is to be made from [this pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/780/files)\n\n ## Background - MaticX\n\n Stader's staking solution for Polygon is MaticX, a liquid staking solution for MATIC. Stader lets users earn MATIC staking rewards and also enables users to participate in other Defi protocols using MaticX while accruing rewards.\n MaticX is a token that represents your share of the total MATIC pool deposited with Stader. As soon as you deposit MATIC on the Stader smart contract, you receive newly minted MaticX, based on the exchange rate at the time of staking. As the MATIC rewards get added the value of MaticX increases (w.r.t MATIC).\n\n Stader for Polygon gives you\n Liquidity through tokenization\n Ease of staking\n MaticX is the only solution that allows users to natively stake their MATIC on Polygon, allowing users to take advantage of the low transaction fee\n\n ## MaticX Security:\n\n Stader on Polygon protocol contracts are dual audited:\n\n [Here](https://staderlabs-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/audits/polygon/StaderLabs_MaticX_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final.pdf) is the link to the Audit completed by Halborn\n [Here](https://staderlabs-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/audits/polygon/StaderLabs_maticX_Audit_Report_Immunebytes.pdf) is the link to the Audit completed by Immunebytes\n Stader's contracts for MaticX are controlled by a multi-sig account (0x91B4139A2FAeaCD4CdbFc3F7B1663F91a54be237) managed by the internal as well as external parties.

      "title": "Initialize cUSDbCv3 on Base",
      "content": "This proposal takes the governance steps recommended and necessary to initialize a Compound III USDbC (bridged version of USDC on Base) market on Base; upon execution, cUSDbCv3 will be ready for use. Simulations have confirmed the market’s readiness, as much as possible, using the [Comet scenario suite](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/tree/main/scenario). Although real tests have also been run over the Goerli/Base Goerli bridge, this will be the first proposal to actually bridge from Ethereum mainnet to Base mainnet, and therefore includes risks not present in previous proposals.\n\nAlthough the proposal sets the entire configuration in the Configurator, the initial deployment already has most of these same parameters already set. The new parameters include setting the risk parameters based off of the [recommendations from Gauntlet](https://www.comp.xyz/t/deploy-compound-iii-on-base/4402/2). Finally, the parameters include a modest reallocation of some of the v2 USDC supply-side COMP incentives to users in the new market.\n\nFurther detailed information can be found on the corresponding [proposal pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/792) and [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/deploy-compound-iii-on-base/4402).\n\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThe first proposal action sets the Comet configuration and deploys a new Comet implementation on Base. This sends the encoded `setConfiguration` and `deployAndUpgradeTo` calls across the bridge to the governance receiver on Base. It also calls `setRewardConfig` on the Base rewards contract, to establish Base’s bridged version of COMP as the reward token for the deployment and set the initial supply speed to be 30 COMP/day and borrow speed to be 15 COMP/day.\n\nThe second action approves Base’s [L1StandardBridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3154Cf16ccdb4C6d922629664174b904d80F2C35) to take the Timelock's USDC, in order to seed the market reserves through the bridge.\n\nThe third action deposits 10K USDC from mainnet to the Base L1StandardBridge contract to bridge to Comet.\n\nThe fourth action approves Base’s [L1StandardBridge](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3154Cf16ccdb4C6d922629664174b904d80F2C35) to take Timelock's COMP, in order to seed the rewards contract through the bridge.\n\nThe fifth action deposits 12.5K COMP from mainnet to the Base L1StandardBridge contract to bridge to CometRewards.\n\nThe sixth action updates the ENS TXT record `v3-official-markets` on `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`, updating the official markets JSON to include the new Base cUSDbCv3 market.\n\nThe seventh action reduces the COMP distribution to v2 cUSDC suppliers by 45 COMP/day, so as to keep the total COMP distribution constant.",

This change will eliminate reserve losses at high utilizations, and aims to increase liquidity for both USDC borrowers and suppliers.\n\nThis change will not affect borrow or supply APRs when utilization is ≤ 90%, and it will have minimal impact on borrow APR when the utilization rate is ≤ 95%.\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-recommendations-ethereum-compound-v3-usdc-ir-curve-incentive-changes-7-6-23/4472)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal updates the base tracking borrow and supply speeds, the borrow kink, and the borrow per year interest rate high slope by using the respective methods on the `Configurator`.\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

Recent examples of Gauntlet's work with Compound incentives include [Migration](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/156) and adjusting [Polygon incentives](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/161).\n\nFull details of the proposal can be found [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-compound-incentive-optimization/4267).\n\n## Proposal\n\nA proposal to formalize and expand Gauntlet’s existing work with Compound on continuous incentive optimization for Compound’s rewards.\n\nAs part of the engagement scope, Gauntlet will provide Compound with a quantitative framework to evaluate the success or failure of incentive optimization. Gauntlet will leverage its Incentive Optimization Platform to provide recommendations adjusting incentives across Compound V2 and Comet markets to drive sustainable, efficient growth.\n\nThe service fee structure is a $300K fixed fee, paid in $COMP tokens, as well as a [variable performance fee](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-compound-incentive-optimization/4267#:~:text=in%20COMP%20tokens-,Performance%2DBased%20Fee%3A,-10%25%20of%20Improvements). This proposal only implements the $300K fixed fee portion.\n\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-compound-incentive-optimization/4267)\n\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal creates a Sablier stream owned by governance to the beneficiary address `0xD20c9667bf0047F313228F9fE11F8b9F8Dc29bBa` for 7,989 COMP over a 365 day vesting duration as detailed above.\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

      "content": "This proposal takes the governance steps recommended and necessary to initialize a Compound III USDC market on Arbitrum; upon execution, cUSDCv3 will be ready for use. Simulations have confirmed the market's readiness, as much as possible, using the [Comet scenario suite](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/tree/main/scenario). Although real tests have also been run over the Goerli/Arbitrum Goerli bridge, this proposal requires estimating gas costs in advance of executing the bridge proposal, and therefore includes risks not present in previous proposals.\n\nAlthough the proposal sets the entire configuration in the Configurator, the initial deployment already has most of these same parameters already set. The new parameters are limited to increasing the supply caps of the collateral assets from their initial values of 0. The risk parameters and supply caps are based off of [recommendations from Gauntlet](https://www.comp.xyz/t/deploy-compound-v3-on-arbitrum/4100/15).\n\nFurther detailed information can be found on the corresponding [proposal pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/719) and [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/deploy-compound-v3-on-arbitrum/4100).\n\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThe first proposal action sets the Comet configuration and deploys a new Comet implementation on Arbitrum. This sends the encoded `setConfiguration` and `deployAndUpgradeTo` calls across the bridge to the governance receiver on Arbitrum. It also calls `setRewardConfig` on the Arbitrum rewards contract, to establish Arbitrum's bridged version of COMP as the reward token for the deployment and set the initial supply speed to be ~34.74 COMP/day.\n\nThe second action approves Arbitrum's [L1 Arb-Custom Gateway](https://etherscan.io/address/0xcEe284F754E854890e311e3280b767F80797180d) to take Timelock's USDC, in order to seed the market reserves through the bridge.\n\nThe third action bridges USDC from mainnet to the Compound instance on Arbitrum, via Arbitrum's [L1GatewayRouter contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef).\n\nThe fourth action approves Arbitrum's [L1 ERC20 Gateway](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa3A7B6F88361F48403514059F1F16C8E78d60EeC) to take Timelock's COMP, in order to seed the rewards contract through the bridge.\n\nThe fifth action transfers COMP from mainnet to the rewards contract on Arbitrum, via Arbitrum's [L1GatewayRouter contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x72Ce9c846789fdB6fC1f34aC4AD25Dd9ef7031ef).\n\nThe sixth action updates the ENS TXT record `v3-official-markets` on `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`, updating the official markets JSON to include the new Arbitrum cUSDCv3 market.\n\nThe seventh action turns off COMP distributions on Compound v2 USDT borrows (~34.74 COMP/day) as they are being shifted to Arbitrum.",

      "title": "Initialize cUSDCv3 on Polygon",
      "content": "This proposal takes the governance steps recommended and necessary to initialize a Compound III USDC market on Polygon; upon execution, cUSDCv3 will be ready for use. Simulations have confirmed the market’s readiness, as much as possible, using the [Comet scenario suite](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/tree/main/scenario). Although real tests have also been run over the Goerli/Mumbai bridge, this will be the first proposal to actually bridge from Ethereum mainnet to another chain, and therefore includes risks not present in previous proposals.\n\nAlthough the proposal sets the entire configuration in the Configurator, the initial deployment already has most of these same parameters already set. The new parameters include setting the pause guardian to a Gnosis [multisig](https://app.safe.global/matic:0x8Ab717CAC3CbC4934E63825B88442F5810aAF6e5/home), which has been created on Polygon to match the same set of signers as currently on Ethereum mainnet. They also include risk parameters based off of the [recommendations from Gauntlet](https://www.comp.xyz/t/initialize-compound-iii-usdc-on-polygon-pos/3611/12). Finally, the parameters include a modest reallocation of some of the v2 USDT COMP rewards to borrowers in the new market.\n\nFurther detailed information can be found on the corresponding [proposal pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/672) and [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/initialize-compound-iii-usdc-on-polygon-pos/3611/11).\n\n\n## Proposal Actions\n\nThe first proposal action sets the Comet configuration and deploys a new Comet implementation on Polygon. This sends the encoded `setConfiguration` and `deployAndUpgradeTo` calls across the bridge to the governance receiver on Polygon.\n\nThe second action approves Polygon's ERC20Predicate to take Timelock's USDC, in order to seed the market reserves through the bridge.\n\nThe third action deposits USDC from mainnet to the Polygon RootChainManager contract to bridge to Comet.\n\nThe fourth action approves Polygon's ERC20Predicate to take Timelock's COMP, in order to seed the rewards contract through the bridge.\n\nThe fifth action deposits COMP from mainnet to the Polygon RootChainManager contract to bridge to CometRewards. \n\nThe sixth action sets up the ENS subdomain `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`,  with the Timelock as the owner.\n\nThe seventh action writes the ENS TXT record `v3-official-markets` on `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth`, containing the official markets JSON.\n\nThe eighth action migrates the COMP distribution for v2 cUSDT suppliers, so as to keep the total COMP distribution constant.\n",

All of the funding is happening transparently and can be tracked on [Questbook](https://questbook.app/)\n\nHowever, we need to attract the best builders to continue to make CGP an ongoing success. Particularly,\n\n- Increase awareness among top builders that Compound grants are back.\n- Increase inflow of builders for proposals in security, multichain-cross chain, and Dev tooling domains\n\nThe invite for builders can more formally be seen here in the form of well-defined RFPs :\n\n- [Dev Tooling](https://www.notion.so/questbook/Madhavan-CGP-DevTooling-Onepager-2a680b4aca784147b5f2ff6a9aadba11)\n- [Security](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dm_x3pThG1ROjjZVDFpS41L5ghtQVy3bcT00SmCujV4/edit)\n- [Multichain & Crosschain Strategy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d_Fj8gXPqPuPhf6nJEPc-SwTV7EqBzAfXfl4OGFZjjE/edit#heading=h.aze6a5lp1qrf)\n\n\n### Impact\n\nUniswap and Aave regularly sponsor events. Their presence in hackathons inspires builders to build on top of their solutions.\n\nCompound has previously sponsored hackathons too. Speaking to the team, we learned that the impact of Compound sponsoring the hackathon was limited to brand recall.\n\nHowever, CGP aims to sponsor ETHGlobal events with the specific goal of getting more builders to build the RFPs laid out by the 4 domains.\n\n**Case studies from CGP 2.0**\n- The [Wido team who will be working on a collateral swap extension for V3](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0xeb047900b28a9f90f3c0e65768b23e7542a65163&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=0x1c9&isRenderingProposalBody=true) won HackMoney 2021 and 2022 before organizing as Wido.\n- Gabriel built a prototype of his wrapper in a hackathon. [He has gotten a grant from the Dev Tooling domain](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?grantId=0x3b16764826f0baa77226327c7c0d7d53f8541913&chainId=10&role=community&proposalId=0x1b1&isRenderingProposalBody=true). His solution is already being used by another grantee.\n\n### What we get\n\n- Partner Table - to explain the RFPs and help builders lay out a development roadmap\n- Workshops (Recorded and in-person) - increase awareness of RFPs by building MVPs of desired projects\n- Connected to the builders - Dedicated channel in the online ETHGlobal community and connect with teams building on the compound.\n\nWe should use sponsorships with a laser focus on inviting builders to the already listed RFPs.\nWe know what we want, we know who can build them, and we know where to find them.\nWe will pick winners only if they’re building something in response to the RFPs listed.\n\n### What exactly will we be paying for?\n\n- ETHGlobal’s sponsorship fees for participation as a protocol in the three aforementioned events.\n- Community member passes for protocol community representatives (ranging from $500 - $1,000 per person, per event). The number of community members that can represent varies from event to event. We decide this by self-nomination and polling on the forum posts for each event.\n- Compound Grants hackathon sponsor bounty prizes ($5,000 - $10,000 per event).\n- This specific grant will NOT include stipends for travel and lodging fees for participants in the in-person events.\n\n### Can I participate in a capacity beyond simply voting for this proposal?\n\nYes! We encourage community members to participate in the events. You may participate as a volunteer mentor, a judge, a hacker, or a presenter.\n\nAdam from Compound Labs will participate as a mentor, developer workshop presenter, and judge for the Compound Grants bounty prizes in each event.\n\nCommunity members may organize a presentation for the events that are based on the Compound protocol or Grants and must drive audience participation in the protocol community or Grants.",

Further explanation can be found on [this forum post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/ens-text-records-for-community-sanctioned-deployments).\n\nThe format for TXT records on this subdomain can be augmented over time. This proposal includes only the bare minimum required to bootstrap an official on-chain list of Compound III markets. Future deployment proposals should include an action to update this ENS record, to reflect adoption by governance.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe proposal itself is to be made from [this pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/671). \n\nThe first action establishes the `v3-additional-grants.compound-community-licenses.eth` ENS subdomain with the Timelock as the owner.\n\nThe second action creates a TXT record on the subdomain containing the cUSDCv3 and cWETHv3 market addresses.\n",

These recommendations are Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations as part of [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dynamic-risk-parameters/2223/16).\n\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-v2-risk-parameter-updates-2023-01-25/4001)\n\n\n## Motivation and Specification\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nOur parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Our parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RyvblTa.png)\n\n\n\n## Dashboard\n\n\nGauntlet has launched the [Compound Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/compound). The community should use the Dashboard to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Compound.\n\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nThese parameter changes decrease borrow usage by 5 basis points, decrease VaR by 15.3%, and decrease LaR by $0.96M.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkJ60ZJ3o.png)\n\n## Specification\n\nThe proposal uses the `Configurator` contract to update the asset parameters listed above using the `_setCollateralFactor` and `_setMarketBorrowCaps` methods.\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nIncrease the supply cap of COMP on the Comet USDC market from 600,000 COMP to 900,000 COMP.\n\n\n## Motivation\n\nSupply caps protect against price manipulation attacks (among other risks) on illiquid tokens that involve supplying the manipulatable token as collateral. In this framework, it is prudent to have tighter supply caps for less liquid tokens. On the other hand, as the use case for v3 grows, the community may wish to increase supply caps to accommodate greater usage. Current market data, including COMP’s +2% market depth at $1.7M, support an increase to the supply cap to allow for organic growth in the market without adding outsized market risk. Should the new supply cap get hit, the current liquidation bonus setting is likely to absorb the expected increase in VaR (1.5x), given the +2% market depth. Gauntlet recommends increasing the COMP supply cap to 900,000.\n\nIn the meantime, Gauntlet is continuing to formulate a formal borrow and supply cap process for Compound V3 to streamline these cap adjustments.\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\nThe proposal uses the `Configurator` contract to update the asset parameters listed above for `cUSDCv3` using the `updateAssetSupplyCap` method and then upgrades `cUSDCv3` to use the newly configured `Comet`.\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

The upgrade will update the UAV’s reference prices from Uniswap V2 pools to Uniswap V3 pools.\n\n[Forum Post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/upgrade-compound-ii-s-oracle-to-uav3/3826?u=getty)\n\nUpdates include:\n* The new UniswapAnchoredView (UAV) no longer records and keeps observations but instead queries the respective Uniswap V3 pool’s observe function to get a TWATP with the set anchor period when it’s needed (i.e., when a reporter calls validate on the UAV).\n* The price of an asset in Uniswap V3 is a function of the “tick” of the pool. The formula is price = 1.0001^tick. The math required for conversion between posted prices and the Uniswap V3 TWATP and the UAV representation has been modified to support this. Relevant libraries (TickMath and FullMath) have been included from the Uniswap V3 codebase.\n* The tests from the original UAV have been adapted to the new Uniswap V3 architecture - i.e., observations/TWATP tests were removed. Hardhat (+typechain) has been implemented so real Uniswap V3 pools can be used via forked mainnet in tests and eliminate the need for mocking Uniswap V3 pools.\n* Increased the Uniswap observation cardinality to 150 on pools that were below 150.\n* Updated the getUnderlyingPrice function to fetch the token configuration using the cToken address instead of calling the underlying function from the token.\n\n\nThe community can review changes in [PR14](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/open-oracle/pull/14) and successful test results [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/open-oracle/actions/runs/3606171573/jobs/6077261024).

We also propose $200K USD (5521.81 COMP) to compensate the grants committee for running the program. Therefore total requested fund is going to be $1M USD = **27609.05 COMP** (calculated as per the most recent COMP price at the time of proposal submission: $36.22)\n- We additionally propose that this budget be managed by 4 individuals called D*omain Allocators* - each managing $200K (5521.81 COMP). These domain allocators would manage grants for a *domain*. These domains are the strategic areas of focus for which the foundation wants to disburse grants.\n- The performance of each of these *domain allocators* will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards.\n- At the end of every quarter, the Compound community can vote to replace, continue or increase budgets for each *domain allocator.*\n- We ([Questbook.xyz](https://questbook.xyz/)) will help facilitate setting up these *domain allocators* and provide the tooling to run the grants program in an efficient and transparent way. We have previously/currently set up the grants process for Polygon, Solana, Celo, and Aave.\n\n# **Purpose**\n\nAn active grant program is a great way to attract and incentivize builders to build on Compound. The goal of this proposal is to benefit all the stakeholders - the builders, the token holders, and the people running the grants operations.\n\n## Problems\n\nTraditionally, most grant programs have a central committee that disburses grants. They typically run into the following issues: \n\n- Committee blind spots - It is unfair to expect any grant committee member to have expertise across various domains. It becomes impossible or inefficient to judge projects that may lie outside the committee’s expertise and may still be valuable to the Compound ecosystem.\n- Manager burnout - A single committee can handle only so many applications at any point in time. By not delegating and decentralizing the capital allocation, the grant program has a bottleneck/single point of failure.\n- Inadequate Tooling - Lack of tools and resources to effectively manage an on-chain governance process. Lack of tools and resources to effectively manage the grant’s workflows on-chain. Most of the grant programs currently use spreadsheets to manage their workflows with hardly any transparency on the fund disbursals and application reviews.\n\n## Solution\n\nGiving domain allocators the capital and decision-making powers can increase the efficiency of the grants program: \n\n- Individual expertise instead of collective blindspots\n- Distributed load instead of committee backlogs\n- Accountability instead of diffusion of responsibility\n\nSpecifically, this program aims to\n\n- Grow Compound’s grants program - measured by the number of builders applying and building on top of Compound\n- Delegate capital allocation - to identify, attract and fund projects/builders that the grants program would otherwise not have funded, by delegating the capital allocation to members of the community rather than a central committee.\n- Strengthen the builder community in the bear market - a crucial component of the community is to keep the builder activity alive even during the bear market. The building keeps innovation and optimism in an otherwise grim market condition. It also drives participation and transparency for the broader community.\n\n# **Program Design**\n\n“*We also believe that more decentralized funding is important for the future of the Ethereum ecosystem. We continuously try to allocate resources to third parties that we believe can make better decisions than us within certain domains.” -* Aya Miyaguchi, Executive Director at Ethereum Foundation [[link]](https://ethereum.foundation/report-2022-04.pdf)\n\nThis program focuses on getting the community to participate in the process of delegating capital allocation. The program disburses $800K (22087.24 COMP) through 4 *domain allocators.* Each domain allocator chosen will be an expert in their specific domain and someone involved in the Compound community.\n\nEach *domain allocator* runs their respective grants program on-chain for full transparency using Questbook. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible for the community.\n\n![dashboard](https://i.imgur.com/CApsbR8.png)\n\nThe disbursement of the grant happens on-chain from a multi-sig wallet controlled by the program manager & the domain allocator. The domain allocator approves or rejects the application based on their evaluation. The program manager will then coordinate with the compound community to ensure that the application is aligned with the Compound growth before signing the disbursal. The sole purpose of the multi-sig is to make sure capital is not being siphoned. However, the allocators are encouraged to make independent decisions regarding the approval of the application based on their expertise.\n\nEvery quarter, the grants committee and the Compound community shall evaluate the performance of each domain using publicly available data. The outcomes could be as follows:\n\n1. Change the domain\n2. Change the allocator/program manager\n3. Change the budget\n\nThe community members can also initiate a no-confidence motion to initiate a review off-cycle. The program manager can coordinate this, if the situation arises, along with the community. The unused funds from every domain will be returned to the treasury at the end of 2 quarters.\n\n## Grants Program Org Structure\n\n![OrgStructure](https://i.imgur.com/nHBmqh9.png)\n\nThe program will consist of \n\n1. A Program Manager \n2. 4 Domain allocators \n\nThere will be a [Grants SAFE](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/3352/54?u=harsha), with 3/5 multi-sig, between the program manager and the 4 domain allocators. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 2/2 between the program manager and the specific domain allocator.\n\nGrants SAFE is where all the initial funds for grants program flow from the treasury. This SAFE holds funds related to operational costs, committee compensation, and the grants budget initially. The domain level SAFEs will have funds only for the disbursal of the approved applications.\n\nAs mentioned by @adam [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/3352/33?u=harsha) and as per the [guidelines](https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-community-ownership-ee0ed1252cc3) of the Compound Labs team, the onus is on the program manager to update the community about approved projects through bi-weekly community developer calls and reports over discord.\n\nBased on the [votes](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/3352/27?u=harsha) from the community we’ve selected the top 4 domains to pilot CGP 2.0 with.  Thanks to the [tweet](https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1565818532373331968?s=20&t=qc2uqoyS9TOvbmbaTwzoDA) from @robertleshner, we had 20+ applications for the domain allocators. Post a thorough evaluation, the following domain allocators have been chosen. Attached are one-pagers for each Domain Allocator to know more details about them.\n\n- Domain: New protocol ideas and dapps, Miscellaneous\n    - Allocator: allthecolors\n    - [Details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12T77eYwpBYeCPUjDr2tjgGg6kdOXozj8/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111002248585347908308&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n- Domain: Security Analysis Tools & Security Bounties\n    - Allocator: Michael from Openzepplin\n    - [Details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TRD6uGvdfJ0uqxGw-sb9ce7kknrjIAfWdybikwujGBo/edit?usp=sharing)\n- Domain: Developer Tooling\n    - Allocator: Madhavan, Questbook’s CEO (Pro-bono basis)\n    - [Details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16rahBd2NXvjURJvXJSZvuys-zfT1JntB6oq6IyY4yx4/edit?usp=sharing)\n    - P.S: Madhavan is operating as an interim Domain Allocator for “Developer Tooling” since we did not find any qualified applicants yet. This role is still open for applications.\n- Domain: Multichain Strategy\n    - Allocator: Bobby Bola from Stablenode\n    - [Details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10eJ6lLvrJqQmvUXlA92jaoEsdeeiX_hwd1patvXBoF4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## **Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities:**\n\nThe roles and responsibilities would be similar to the ones used in [CGP 1.0](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-grants-program/1292), incorporating the learnings posted by the CGP 1.0 team [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-grants-program-lessons-and-next-steps/2264/11) \n\n1. Time commitment per week: Estimated 25 hours per week for the program manager and 15 hours per week for the domain allocator, which might vary based on the number of applications. The program manager ensures that the load is well distributed.\n2. Program Manager:\n    1. Communication:\n        1. Coordinate with the Compound team and the community regarding the required funds.\n        2. Communicate regarding the approval/rejection of projects to the Compound community on a regular basis.\n        3. Attend bi-weekly community developer calls, keep the community updated and take their feedback on the program.\n        4. Regularly update the Compound community over discord regarding the progress of the grants program.\n    2. Grants Program:\n        1. Source good-quality applications from developer communities. \n        2. Sign the transactions for the approved projects. \n        3. Ensure a quick turnaround time for the applications regarding their approval.\n        4. Coordinate between the domain allocators to ensure that the work is well distributed and take their feedback to ensure the program.\n    \n3. Domain Allocator: \n    1. Reviews the applications received in their domain based on the rubrics set by the domain allocator.\n    2. Approve/Reject the applications and coordinates the same with the program manager.\n    3. Source applications by reaching out to the developer communities in their network.\n    4. Discuss with the other domain allocators and the program manager to improve the grants process during scheduled meetings.\n\n## Legal Compliance:\n\nWe’re working with [BLG](https://twitter.com/BlockchainLG) - Blockchain Lawyers Group for the CGP 2.0 legal compliances. Among the founding members of this group are:\n\n- [eaglelex](https://twitter.com/eaglelex_eth): Law Professor and EU licensed Attorney, Polygon Technology Advisor, Legal advisor for the Polygon Grants Program.\n- [MDLawyer](https://twitter.com/MDLawyer_): Corporate and Venture Capital Lawyer in London\n- [ByianMienert](https://twitter.com/biyanmienert): Crypto Lawyer, first-ever Ph.D. written on DAO law\n- [LarryFlorio](https://twitter.com/LarryFlorio): GC Delphia; Corporate Lawyer with Securities expertise\n\nThe BLG independent Legal Advisors will support CGP 2.0 for the contractual drafting, the application of KYC standards, and every legal issue that may arise during the grant disbursement phase. They will also be available for early-stage legal support to the selected projects.\n\nAccepted grant applicants of CGP 2.0 will sign a contract ([sample](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OMnt68J62E8G95ZBTOAmwLV_htRT7HyoeGUp1WGgKIQ/edit?usp=sharing)) post the KYC to ensure that the grant fund isn’t misused. BLG will receive a contribution of $3K USD (82.82 COMP) for the above-mentioned tasks, payment will be made from the operating fund budget received as part of this program. We are working with [Synaps](https://synaps.io/) for the KYC/KYB of the grant applicants.\n\n## **Compensation:**\n\nPlease find the voting results for the committee compensation [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/3352/28?u=harsha).\n\nThe grant budget is $800K (22087.24 COMP) with $200K(5521.81 COMP) for each domain. The committee compensation is $200K(5521.81 COMP) for 4 Domain Allocators and one Program manager for 6 months.\n\n![Compensation](https://i.imgur.com/9K5nXAL.png)\n\nP.S: \n\n1. Madhavan from Questbook is operating as an interim Domain Allocator for “Developer Tooling” since we did not find any qualified applicants yet. He will be operating on a pro-bono basis.\n2. All payout amounts will be done in COMP and are calculated as per the most recent COMP price at the time of proposal submission: $36.22\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\n## **What does success look like?**\n\n- **Objective**\n    - The prime objective of this model is to have domains that align with Compound’s priorities. This way the contribution of the projects as part of the grants program is directly adding value to the DAO and the token holders.\n    - Increase in the number of builders & projects being funded.\n    - Increase in the homegrown leadership to run grant programs (measured by the number of people running grant programs).\n    - Increase in the community members’ participation to keep grant programs accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n    - Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community to regularly review the project domains, during the Compound developer call and also comment on the initial post [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/3352/1).\n    - Increased engagement in builder community’s\n        - Discourse\n        - Discord, Telegram\n        - Social media (Twitter, Reddit)\n        - GitHub, Radicle\n        - DAO Tools - gnosis, etc.\n\n- **Subjective**\n    - Improved community involvement in the grants program\n    - Strengthened Builders’ sentiment towards Compound.\n    - Enhanced Compound’s brand recognition in builder circles\n\n## **About Questbook:**\n\nQuestbook’s role in CGP 2.0\n\n- Sriharsha Karamchati, co-founder of Questbook will be the first program manager. Thereafter, the program manager will be elected from the community.\n- Questbook Grants tool will make sure the workflows are systematic and transparent.\n- Madhavan Malolan, co-founder of Questbook will be involved with the Dev Tooling grants domain.\n\n## Questbook Product:\n\nQuestbook is a decentralized grants orchestration tool.

      "title": "CIP-1: Compound Improvement Proposal Adoption",
      "content": "# Summary\nThis is a vote to adopt CIP-1 as the foundational process for Compound Improvement Proposals. Per the adoption process for Meta CIPs, CIP-1 will go through a snapshot vote for 1 week with a simple majority and no quorum threshold. Details on CIP-1 can be found below or in the following [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eiy5IxLcnfGC3UHQ11cBroGJpxPVSWqMaMOq0j3dhJE/edit#heading=h.mvjq6jf0433)\n\n# CIP-1: Purpose and Guidelines for Compound Improvement Proposals\n\nAuthor: Michael Lewellen\nContributors: @allthecolors, @dakeshi, @adam_b_compound, @harsha, @boardroom, @kevin\nStatus: Final Call\nType: Meta Process\nCreated: 2022-10-20\n\n## Overview\n\nA Compound Improvement Proposal (CIP) describes standards, processes and enhancements intended to improve the Compound Protocol. They can take the form of governance processes, on-chain enhancements, off-chain tooling or other goals that help Compound achieve objectives as a leading DeFi lending platform.\n\n\n## CIP Rationale\n\nCIPs are intended to be the default mechanism to improve Compound as both on-chain code and off-chain processes.\n\nIt’s important to note that CIPs are strictly separate from [Compound Governor Proposals](https://compound.finance/governance) and should not be considered a required prerequisite for submitting an on-chain proposal. Instead, CIPs are intended to define better processes for certain types of Governance Proposals in addition to serving as a way to solicit community feedback and acceptance on certain protocol enhancements before they are submitted on-chain.\n\nOverall, CIPs serve as a collection point for improvement suggestions for the protocol. Community participants can also use CIPs to find contribution opportunities and even seek funding through grant committees and other support groups.\n\n\n## CIP Types\n\nThere are three types of CIP:\n\n\n\n1. **Meta Process** - describes any process to be adopted or modified to coordinate Compound governance, development, or community efforts\n2. **Protocol Enhancement** - describes any change to the smart contracts that make up the Compound Protocol and Governor\n3. **Tooling & Support** - describes any additions or improvements to off-chain infrastructure, tooling, documentation or other components that support the usage of the Compound protocol.\n\n\n## CIP Lifecycle\n\nCIP Authors will start out with an idea, draft that idea into a CIP document, request a peer review and then move through an approval process with the Compound Working Group. Ideas can be filed as issues on a commonly shared GitHub similar to [Ethereum PM](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/). CIPs can be drafted as PRs and then request review to be added to the agenda for the biweekly Working Group meetings.\n \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigc72pcgfa7sze5nadlbp3jrpb2r4f2dvhrmkhm6q4w6otruzaexi)\n    \n    \nCIP Editors will be selected from among core community contributors that will attend meetings regularly and provide feedback to CIPs. If any objections are raised to a CIP in its first meeting, it must address that feedback and then request another review in a future meeting. In a CIP’s second meeting, if there are no objections OR a majority of Editors are in favor, the CIP is approved and then remains in Last Call for 14 days before the implementation process begins.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreig3mazojyhynck673fbqkkawegfjiqt7yjjityh53ojh456pucdbu)\n    \n\nOnce past the Working Group, a CIP’s implementation path will diverge depending on its type. Meta Process CIPs will be approved by a majority Signal vote by COMP holders with no quorum after which they will become officially adopted as part of the Compound governance process that all COMP holders are expected to uphold. Other CIPs are left to the community to implement which can include funding to be approved by a Grant Committee or any other entity willing to support. Protocol Enhancements will also need to pass through a Compound Governance vote just as any other smart contract change would.\n\n\n## What belongs in a successful CIP?\n\nEach CIP should have the following parts:\n\n\n\n* **Preamble** - RFC 822 style headers containing metadata about the CIP, including the CIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), a description (limited to a maximum of 140 characters), and the author details.\n* **Abstract** - Abstract is a multi-sentence (short paragraph) technical summary. This should be a very terse and human-readable version of the specification section. Someone should be able to read only the abstract to get the gist of what this specification does.\n* **Motivation** - A motivation section should clearly explain why the existing protocol state is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves. \n* **Proposal Details** - One or more sections that thoroughly explain the technical solution and/or processes of the proposal . The specification should be detailed enough to allow for either a technical implementation or adoption of a governance process should the CIP be approved.\n* **Rationale** - The rationale describes what motivated the CIP and why particular design or process decisions were made. It should include alternate designs/processes that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature/process is implemented in other protocols. The rationale should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion around the CIP including technical and legal concerns.\n* **Expected Impact** - The CIP’s expected impact should list measurable results for how Compound will be improved by its implementation. It might also take note of negative trade-offs mentioned in the Rationale section and demonstrate here that they are outweighed by the positive effects.\n* **Security Considerations** _(optional)_ - While not always required for “Meta Process” or “Tooling & Support” CIPs, every “Protocol Enhancement” must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change.\n* **Copyright Waiver** - All CIPs must be in the public domain. The copyright waiver MUST link to the license file and use the following wording: _Copyright and related rights waived via [CC0](/LICENSE)._\n\n\n## CIP Formats and Templates\n\nCIPs should be written in markdown format. There is a template to follow that will be established in a GitHub repository for tracking and approving all CIPs.\n\n\n## CIP Editors\n\nThe current CIP editors are:\n\n* Michael Lewellen (@cylon)\n* Sriharsha Karamchati (@harsha)\n* @Arr00\n* Jared Flatow (@jared)\n* Geoffery Hayes (@hayesgm)\n* Kevin Cheng (@kevin)\n* Duncan Dobbelmann (@Boardroom)\n* @Dakeshi\n* Michael Imperiale (@CL_Michael)\n\n## CIP Editor Responsibilities\n\nFor each new CIP that comes in, an editor does the following:\n\n* Read the CIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don’t seem likely to get to final status.\n* The title should accurately describe the content.\n* Check the CIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (GitHub flavored Markdown), code style\n\nIf the CIP isn’t ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.\n\nOnce the CIP is ready for the repository, the CIP editor will:\n\n* Assign a CIP number (generally the PR number, but the decision is with the editors)\n* Merge the corresponding pull request\n* Send a message back to the CIP author with the next step.\n* The CIP editors monitor CIP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.\n\nThe editors don’t pass judgment on CIPs. They merely do the administrative & editorial part. Editors may still voice either support or opposition to the CIP’s claims of improving Compound but that should not factor into their decision-making criteria to approve a CIP. That will come down to the implementation phase where a CIP is left up to a Snapshot, Governance or Grant decision.\n\n## History\n\nThis document was derived heavily from [Ethereum’s EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1), written by Martin Becze and Hudson Jameson, which in turn was derived from [Bitcoin’s BIP-0001](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips), written by Amir Taaki, which in turn was derived from [Python’s PEP-0001](https://peps.python.org/).

We also propose $200K USD (4893.56 COMP) to compensate the grants committee for running the program. Therefore total requested fund is going to be $1M USD = **24467.82 COMP** (calculated as per the most recent COMP price at the time of proposal submission: $40.87)\n- We additionally propose that this budget be managed by 4 individuals called D*omain Allocators* - each managing $200K (4893.56 COMP). These domain allocators would manage grants for a *domain*. These domains are the strategic areas of focus for which the foundation wants to disburse grants.\n- The performance of each of these *domain allocators* will be publicly viewable and auditable using rich dashboards.\n- At the end of every quarter, the Compound community can vote to replace, continue or increase budgets for each *domain allocator.*\n- We ([Questbook.xyz](https://questbook.xyz/)) will help facilitate setting up these *domain allocators* and provide the tooling to run the grants program in an efficient and transparent way. We have previously/currently set up the grants process for Polygon, Solana, Celo, and Aave.\n\n# **Purpose**\n\nAn active grant program is a great way to attract and incentivize builders to build on Compound. The goal of this proposal is to benefit all the stakeholders - the builders, the token holders, and the people running the grants operations.\n\n## Problems\n\nTraditionally, most grant programs have a central committee that disburses grants. They typically run into the following issues: \n\n- Committee blind spots - It is unfair to expect any grant committee member to have expertise across various domains. It becomes impossible or inefficient to judge projects that may lie outside the committee’s expertise and may still be valuable to the Compound ecosystem.\n- Manager burnout - A single committee can handle only so many applications at any point in time. By not delegating and decentralizing the capital allocation, the grant program has a bottleneck/single point of failure.\n- Inadequate Tooling - Lack of tools and resources to effectively manage an on-chain governance process. Lack of tools and resources to effectively manage the grant’s workflows on-chain. Most of the grant programs currently use spreadsheets to manage their workflows with hardly any transparency on the fund disbursals and application reviews.\n\n## Solution\n\nGiving domain allocators the capital and decision-making powers can increase the efficiency of the grants program: \n\n- Individual expertise instead of collective blindspots\n- Distributed load instead of committee backlogs\n- Accountability instead of diffusion of responsibility\n\nSpecifically, this program aims to\n\n- Grow Compound’s grants program - measured by the number of builders applying and building on top of Compound\n- Delegate capital allocation - to identify, attract and fund projects/builders that the grants program would otherwise not have funded, by delegating the capital allocation to members of the community rather than a central committee.\n- Strengthen the builder community in the bear market - a crucial component of the community is to keep the builder activity alive even during the bear market. The building keeps innovation and optimism in an otherwise grim market condition. It also drives participation and transparency for the broader community.\n\n# **Program Design**\n\n“*We also believe that more decentralized funding is important for the future of the Ethereum ecosystem. We continuously try to allocate resources to third parties that we believe can make better decisions than us within certain domains.” -* Aya Miyaguchi, Executive Director at Ethereum Foundation [[link]](https://ethereum.foundation/report-2022-04.pdf)\n\nThis program focuses on getting the community to participate in the process of delegating capital allocation. The program disburses $800K (19574.25 COMP) through 4 *domain allocators.* Each domain allocator chosen will be an expert in their specific domain and someone involved in the Compound community.\n\nEach *domain allocator* runs their respective grants program on-chain for full transparency using Questbook. The data and performance across key metrics will be visible for the community.\n\n[https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JGIHqd1AeCmAWWIOq_g1gTvViVUbG748Mg5j5PlKGzHXaWkvKhK536sgQIKZ-C2Iyh6HzRRoexps_yfqSvLrgClkIEp5dotirOtGKDrIO_yq3ukBkRZ5fwpl03xsQaF2vsqnNuJW1kDPSdKZgjG4UGTwLkaNgXGui6McRyBaHhgT9oB4Vvc-A6ze](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/JGIHqd1AeCmAWWIOq_g1gTvViVUbG748Mg5j5PlKGzHXaWkvKhK536sgQIKZ-C2Iyh6HzRRoexps_yfqSvLrgClkIEp5dotirOtGKDrIO_yq3ukBkRZ5fwpl03xsQaF2vsqnNuJW1kDPSdKZgjG4UGTwLkaNgXGui6McRyBaHhgT9oB4Vvc-A6ze)\n\nThe disbursement of the grant happens on-chain from a multi-sig wallet controlled by the program manager & the domain allocator. The domain allocator approves or rejects the application based on their evaluation. The program manager will then coordinate with the compound community to ensure that the application is aligned with the Compound growth before signing the disbursal. The sole purpose of the multi-sig is to make sure capital is not being siphoned. However, the allocators are encouraged to make independent decisions regarding the approval of the application based on their expertise.\n\nEvery quarter, the grants committee and the Compound community shall evaluate the performance of each domain using publicly available data. The outcomes could be as follows:\n\n1. Change the domain\n2. Change the allocator/program manager\n3. Change the budget\n\nThe community members can also initiate a no-confidence motion to initiate a review off-cycle. The program manager can coordinate this, if the situation arises, along with the community. The unused funds from every domain will be returned to the treasury at the end of 2 quarters.\n\n## Grants Program Org Structure\n\n![Program Manager (3).png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/03be9e65-fc3f-4546-9842-d355cf51517a/Program_Manager_(3).png)\n\nThe program will consist of \n\n1. A Program Manager \n2. 4 Domain allocators \n\nThere will be a Grants SAFE, with 3/5 multi-sig, between the program manager and the 4 domain allocators. We will then have 4 SAFEs for each of the domains with a 2/2 between the program manager and the specific domain allocator.\n\nGrants SAFE is where all the initial funds for grants program flow from the treasury. This SAFE holds funds related to operational costs, committee compensation, and the grants budget initially. The domain level SAFEs will have funds only for the disbursal of the approved applications.\n\nAs mentioned by @adam [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/3352/33?u=harsha) and as per the [guidelines](https://medium.com/compound-finance/compound-community-ownership-ee0ed1252cc3) of the Compound Labs team, the onus is on the program manager to update the community about approved projects through bi-weekly community developer calls and reports over discord.\n\nBased on the [votes](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/3352/27?u=harsha) from the community we’ve selected the top 4 domains to pilot CGP 2.0 with.  Thanks to the [tweet](https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1565818532373331968?s=20&t=qc2uqoyS9TOvbmbaTwzoDA) from @robertleshner, we had 20+ applications for the domain allocators. Post a thorough evaluation, the following domain allocators have been chosen. Attached are one-pagers for each Domain Allocator to know more details about them.\n\n- Domain: New protocol ideas and dapps, Miscellaneous\n    - Allocator: allthecolors\n    - [Details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12T77eYwpBYeCPUjDr2tjgGg6kdOXozj8/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111002248585347908308&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n- Domain: Security Analysis Tools & Security Bounties\n    - Allocator: Michael from Openzepplin\n    - [Details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TRD6uGvdfJ0uqxGw-sb9ce7kknrjIAfWdybikwujGBo/edit?usp=sharing)\n- Domain: Developer Tooling\n    - Allocator: Madhavan, Questbook’s CEO (Pro-bono basis)\n    - [Details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16rahBd2NXvjURJvXJSZvuys-zfT1JntB6oq6IyY4yx4/edit?usp=sharing)\n    - P.S: Madhavan is operating as an interim Domain Allocator for “Developer Tooling” since we did not find any qualified applicants yet. This role is still open for applications.\n- Domain: Multichain Strategy\n    - Allocator: Bobby Bola from Stablenode\n    - [Details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10eJ6lLvrJqQmvUXlA92jaoEsdeeiX_hwd1patvXBoF4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## **Domain Allocator Roles & Responsibilities:**\n\nThe roles and responsibilities would be similar to the ones used in [CGP 1.0](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-grants-program/1292), incorporating the learnings posted by the CGP 1.0 team [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-grants-program-lessons-and-next-steps/2264/11) \n\n1. Time commitment per week: Estimated 25 hours per week for the program manager and 15 hours per week for the domain allocator, which might vary based on the number of applications. The program manager ensures that the load is well distributed.\n2. Program Manager:\n    1. Communication:\n        1. Coordinate with the Compound team and the community regarding the required funds.\n        2. Communicate regarding the approval/rejection of projects to the Compound community on a regular basis.\n        3. Attend bi-weekly community developer calls, keep the community updated and take their feedback on the program.\n        4. Regularly update the Compound community over discord regarding the progress of the grants program.\n    2. Grants Program:\n        1. Source good-quality applications from developer communities. \n        2. Sign the transactions for the approved projects. \n        3. Ensure a quick turnaround time for the applications regarding their approval.\n        4. Coordinate between the domain allocators to ensure that the work is well distributed and take their feedback to ensure the program.\n    \n3. Domain Allocator: \n    1. Reviews the applications received in their domain based on the rubrics set by the domain allocator.\n    2. Approve/Reject the applications and coordinates the same with the program manager.\n    3. Source applications by reaching out to the developer communities in their network.\n    4. Discuss with the other domain allocators and the program manager to improve the grants process during scheduled meetings.\n\n## Legal Compliance:\n\nWe’re working with [BLG](https://twitter.com/BlockchainLG) - Blockchain Lawyers Group for the CGP 2.0 legal compliances. Among the founding members of this group are:\n\n- [eaglelex](https://twitter.com/eaglelex_eth): Law Professor and EU licensed Attorney, Polygon Technology Advisor, Legal advisor for the Polygon Grants Program.\n- [MDLawyer](https://twitter.com/MDLawyer_): Corporate and Venture Capital Lawyer in London\n- [ByianMienert](https://twitter.com/biyanmienert): Crypto Lawyer, first-ever Ph.D. written on DAO law\n- [LarryFlorio](https://twitter.com/LarryFlorio): GC Delphia; Corporate Lawyer with Securities expertise\n\nThe BLG independent Legal Advisors will support CGP 2.0 for the contractual drafting, the application of KYC standards, and every legal issue that may arise during the grant disbursement phase. They will also be available for early-stage legal support to the selected projects.\n\nAccepted grant applicants of CGP 2.0 will sign a contract ([sample](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OMnt68J62E8G95ZBTOAmwLV_htRT7HyoeGUp1WGgKIQ/edit?usp=sharing)) post the KYC to ensure that the grant fund isn’t misused. BLG will receive a contribution of $3K USD (77.78 COMP) for the above-mentioned tasks, payment will be made from the operating fund budget received as part of this program. We are working with [Synaps](https://synaps.io/) for the KYC/KYB of the grant applicants.\n\n## **Compensation:**\n\nPlease find the voting results for the committee compensation [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/3352/28?u=harsha).\n\nThe grant budget is $800K (19574.25 COMP) with $200K(4893.56 COMP) for each domain. The committee compensation is $200K(4893.56 COMP) for 4 Domain Allocators and one Program manager for 6 months.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-10-01 at 7.19.16 PM.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/3cc298ad-06a7-417e-abf0-159da037c299/Screenshot_2022-10-01_at_7.19.16_PM.png)\n\nP.S: \n\n1. Madhavan from Questbook is operating as an interim Domain Allocator for “Developer Tooling” since we did not find any qualified applicants yet. He will be operating on a pro-bono basis.\n2. All payout amounts will be done in COMP and are calculated as per the most recent COMP price at the time of proposal submission: $40.87\n\n# **Conclusion**\n\n## **What does success look like?**\n\n- **Objective**\n    - The prime objective of this model is to have domains that align with Compound’s priorities. This way the contribution of the projects as part of the grants program is directly adding value to the DAO and the token holders.\n    - Increase in the number of builders & projects being funded.\n    - Increase in the homegrown leadership to run grant programs (measured by the number of people running grant programs).\n    - Increase in the community members’ participation to keep grant programs accountable (measured by the number of people looking at the dashboard and participating in the program)\n    - Diversity in projects being funded across technologies, geographies, and demographics, to name a few. We encourage the community to regularly review the project domains, during the Compound developer call and also comment on the initial post [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/cgp-2-0-delegated-domain-allocation-by-questbook/3352/1).\n    - Increased engagement in builder community’s\n        - Discourse\n        - Discord, Telegram\n        - Social media (Twitter, Reddit)\n        - GitHub, Radicle\n        - DAO Tools - gnosis, etc.\n\n- **Subjective**\n    - Improved community involvement in the grants program\n    - Strengthened Builders’ sentiment towards Compound.\n    - Enhanced Compound’s brand recognition in builder circles\n\n## **About Questbook:**\n\nQuestbook’s role in CGP 2.0\n\n- Sriharsha Karamchati, co-founder of Questbook will be the first program manager.

      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust one (1) parameter for one (1) Compound V2 asset.\n\nWe recommend decreasing SUSHI collateral factor from 73% to 70%. The community has aligned on a [risk off framework](https://snapshot.org/#/comp-vote.eth/proposal/bafkreiar7qfbmmabclsogilncy542cyenehjulmdhhewuzojdooer4tnje). \n\n## Background\nGauntlet's simulation engine has ingested the latest market and liquidity data. These recommendations are Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations as part of [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dynamic-risk-parameters/2223/16) and align with the [Moderate risk level](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-risk-level-consensus-check/2437) chosen by the Compound community.\n\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/risk-parameter-updates-2022-10-26/3735)\n\n\n## Motivation and Specification\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nOur parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Our parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1zuKzVq.png)\n\n\n## Dashboard\n\n\nGauntlet has launched the [Compound Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/compound). The community should use the Dashboard to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Compound.\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nThese parameter changes decrease borrow usage by 1 basis point, decrease VaR by $8.15k and decrease SUSHI VaR by 14.3%\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/isyMLsG.png)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

      "title": "Liquidation Event Handling And Collateral Reserves",
      "content": "## Explanation\n\n### Emit `Transfer` event from `absorb`\nWhen a user is liquidated in Compound III, all of their collateral is absorbed into the protocol, and they are typically left with a positive balance of the base asset (USDC) and no debt (or collateral dust).\n\nShortly after the first market launched, [a community developer noticed](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297/status/1568994083380535296) that the `absorb` function was missing an event log in the case when an account is left with a positive balance.\n\nWhile this doesn’t have any economic impact, adding this event log will improve the user experience on Etherscan and blockchain explorers, and make analytics easier.\n\n### Implicit collateral reserves\n\nWithout this patch, the collateral which is bought using `buyCollateral` must be part of the protocol's balance explicitly, which can happen during `absorb`. Excess collateral simply transferred to the protocol will not be available as collateral reserves to be sold by the protocol automatically.\n\nWith this patch, all of the excess collateral asset available using the ERC20 `balanceOf` function is implicitly considered part of collateral reserves. This means that accidentally transferring the ERC20 to the protocol will automatically become reserves. It also means that interest accrued implicitly, e.g. when the collateral is the token of another Compound III market, will automatically become part of reserves, which can be sold by the protocol and bought using `buyCollateral`.\n\nThis patch also formalizes the idea of collateral reserves in general, adding a `getCollateralReserves(asset)` function.\n\nThe associated forum post for this proposal can be found [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/liquidation-event-handling/3684).\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe proposal itself is to be made from [this pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/pull/599). \n\nThe first step is to deploy a new CometFactory, using the patched version of the contract, which adds the Transfer event to `absorb` and modifies the total collateral accounting. This is done as a ‘prepare’ step of the migration script.\n\nThe first action of the proposal is to set the factory for cUSDCv3 to the newly deployed factory.\n\nThe second action is to deploy and upgrade to a new implementation of Comet, using the newly configured factory.\n\nThe third action is to transfer 10 COMP to ilemi.eth (0x2Ae8c972fB2E6c00ddED8986E2dc672ED190DA06), as a reward for identifying the issue and suggesting the `Transfer` event improvement.\n",

However, out of an abundance of caution, we propose pausing supply for the above assets, given their relative liquidity profiles.\n\nImportantly, this will be a step towards incentivizing migration from Compound V2 to Compound V3, which the community has voiced support for. Compound V3 has meaningfully more risk controls, including supply caps. \n\n\n\n## Specification\n\n\n- Pauses supplying on cZRX, cBAT, cMKR, and cYFI by calling `_setMintPaused` on the Comptroller contract\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

      "title": "Adjust cCOMP and cUNI Parameters",
      "content": "### Summary\n\nThis proposal makes changes to the cCOMP and cUNI markets. The borrow cap for cCOMP is increased from 90,750 to 150,000 COMP, and the cCOMP interest rate model is switched to the rate model currently in use for cUNI, resulting in slightly higher borrowing costs across the utilization curve. The rate model for cUNI is switched to the rate model currently in use for cAAVE/cMKR/cYFI/cSUSHI, normalizing it with other similar assets and resulting in slightly lower borrowing costs across the utilization curve.\n\n### Reasoning\n\nRecently the v2 cCOMP market has seen high utilization, with total borrowings currently at the 90,750 COMP borrow cap. This implies that market parameters are not well optimized and some users are taking advantage of artificially compressed borrowing costs. The proposed changes will increase borrowing capacity and borrow rates, which should help the market reach a more suitable equilibrium and increase supply rates. \n\nWhile the COMP borrow cap still plays an important role in protecting against governance manipulation, recent votes have shown strong participation, indicating that a moderate increase in the cap is safe.\n\nMoving the cUNI market interest rate model to the model currently in use for other defi tokens will normalize interest rates across similar assets. This change and also allows for the possibility of making additional updates to the cCOMP interest rate curve in the future if necessary, as the cCOMP market will no longer share a common interest rate model contract with other assets.\n\nSee discussion in the [forum](https://www.comp.xyz/t/update-ccomp-parameters-borrow-cap-and-interest-rate-model/3614/8) for more details.",

      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust risk parameters for FEI as follows:\n\n\n* Pause cFEI minting.\n* Set reserve factor to 100%.\n\n\n## Background\nDetails are provided in the governance forum posts regarding [FEI](https://www.comp.xyz/t/deprecate-fei-market/3513).\n\n\n## Motivation\n\n\nIn light of Tribe DAO’s proposal to enter a terminal state, the FEI market on Compound should be deprecated. Pausing FEI supplying and setting a 100% reserve factor is the second step in winding down the FEI market.\n\nThis will allow all borrowing positions to be immediately closed. To avoid having your position closed, we’d recommend FEI borrowers on Compound repay their positions as soon as possible.\n\n## Specification\n\n- Sets the cFEI reserve factor to 100% by calling `_setReserveFactor` on the cFEI contract\n- Pauses supplying on cFEI by calling `_setMintPaused` on the Comptroller contract\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

      "content": "## Overview\n\nBlockchain at Berkeley is partnering with Commonwealth to migrate Compound governance discussions to the Commonwealth platform. We are excited to support more transparency in the governance process by sponsoring this proposal on Commonwealth's behalf. This proposal aims to outline a plan to improve Compound’s current community governance discussion and voting processes. Adopting Commonwealth as the governance forum for Compound will increase governance **discussion**, **engagement** and **transparency**.\n\nCommonwealth consolidates multiple community tools into one place by offering a fully crypto-native forum and voting interfaces (polls, Snapshot, and on-chain governance) all in one platform. Commonwealth is completely free to use and will soon be fully-decentralized.\n\nWe respectfully submit this proposal for your consideration, and we are looking forward to your questions and feedback.\n\n## Proposal\n\nMigrate the current Compound governance forum from Discourse to Commonwealth.\n\n## Voting Options\n\n**In favor:**\n\nMigrate to Commonwealth\n\n**Against:**\n\nDo nothing\n\n### About Commonwealth\n\nCommonwealth consolidates forum discussions, snapshot voting and on-chain voting into an all-in-one platform for decentralized communities to run themselves.\n\nWe power over 900 DAOs including [dYdX 1](https://commonwealth.im/dydx), [Stargate 1](https://commonwealth.im/stargatetoken), [Osmosis](https://commonwealth.im/osmosis), [Element Finance 1](https://commonwealth.im/element-finance), [Axie Infinity 1](https://commonwealth.im/axie-infinity), and [Redacted Cartel 1](https://commonwealth.im/redacted-cartel). Commonwealth has raised $20M+ from Dragonfly, Parafi, Polychain, Framework, Hashed, Nascent, Spark, Balaji, Stani, and others.\n\nCompound [Commonwealth 2 min Feature Walk Thru 5](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/r8C2AAfKV24Wodgo2574j5?)\n\n### Commonwealth Key Benefits & Solution\n\n1. Hosting all community discussions, snapshot votes and on-chain governance on one platform improves access to information and reduced tooling friction\n2. Linking previous forum discussions to their respective proposals improves voter education and transparency, enabling members to make informed decisions, thus increasing voter turnout\n3. Enabling users to access all of their communities via a single interface and the consolidated user dashboard increases participation and allows users to easily stay up to date with current community governance initiatives\n4. Ability to own your community platform for free and stop paying rent to web2 platforms\n5. Robust token gating + wallet login helps prevent spam and social engineering attacks\n6. High-touch customer service to quickly resolve any issues and implement new features, *check out our roadmap at the bottom to see what we’re actively pushing*\n7. Ability to create separate, but linked subDAOs for more complex org structures\n\n### Commonwealth Transition Process\n\nM**igrating to Commonwealth takes a few minutes:**\n\n1. Download a back data dump of the Compound Discourse Forum\n2. Commonwealth imports the Compound forum to Commonwealth (maintains all content, profiles and past activity)\n3. Commonwealth integrates the Compound Governor Bravo governance contracts and Snapshot (creates bidirectional governance interfaces)\n4. Community owned and run forum\n\n**For users, using Commonwealth is simple:**\n\n1. Link your wallet via Metamask or Wallet Connect\n2. Join the Compound Commonwealth forum\n3. Link the same email you used for Discourse to claim your old account\n4. Begin discussions\n\n## Commonwealth Roadmap\n\nCommonwealth is a Web3 platform working to empower Web3 projects.\n\nWe’re continuously building key features and workflows based partner feedback to improve DAO engagement, empower DAO growth and increase DAO success.\n\n### Upcoming Commonwealth Product Initiatives\n\n- Notifications\n    - We are building out more robust in-app, email, and push notifications. EPNS has already begun deploying governance notifications for Commonwealth activity.\n- Moderation\n    - We are enabling more complex community moderation functionality. This includes time-bans, rule logic for community roles, and spam prevention methods.\n- Common API\n    - Our soon to be launched API enables other tools and projects to tap into the social data from the Commonwealth platform.\n- Common App Store\n    - Roll out an app store offering full composability of DAO tools within a single interface. This will enable DAOs to process payroll, manage their treasury, create POAPs, etc. without needing to flip applications.\n\nIf you have a key feature you’d like to see on the Compound Forum, we’d love to chat and build out the functionality to empower Compound.\n\n## Further Resources\n\n[Why Commonwealth](https://www.notion.so/Why-Commonwealth-1544dcdd4af54420b6ce031e0507957a)\n\n[Website](http://commonwealth.im/)\n\n[Docs](https://docs.commonwealth.im/commonwealth/)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/hicommonwealth)\n\n**Leadership Team**\n\nDillon Chen - Founder - prev.

      "content": "## Background\nFor the past three years, Gauntlet has worked with Compound to maximize the protocol’s capital efficiency given an acceptable level of market risk.\n\nFull details of the proposal can be found [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-compound-renewal/3541).\n\n\n\n## Proposal\n\nA proposal to renew Gauntlet’s 12-month engagement with Compound on continuous market risk management to maximize capital efficiency while minimizing the risk of insolvency and liquidations to create long-term sustainable growth.\n\nGauntlet’s Risk Management platform quantifies risk, optimizes risk parameters, runs economic stress tests, and calibrates parameters dynamically. Gauntlet uses agent-based simulation models tuned to actual market data to model tail market events and interactions between different users within DeFi protocols. The proposal includes continued support for Compound II, as well as support for Compound III. \n\nThe service fee structure will be the same as the previous year’s engagement and calculated quarterly per the following formula: log(Number of Assets, 10) * Total Borrow * Marginal Base Fee tier bps / 4. \n\nTo increase its alignment with Compound, Gauntlet will refund a portion of the payment should Gauntlet's risk parameter optimizations incur losses for the protocol during the engagement. For more details, see the full [proposal](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-compound-renewal/3541).\n\n\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n",

      "content": "## Rate of Change Consensus \nTo achieve sustainability, Compound must combine *value creation* under favorable market conditions with *protection* of itself and its users when conditions become unfavorable [1]. \n\n**Compound must be able to lower the collateral factor of collateral assets to reduce the risk it and its users face under those adverse conditions**.\n\nCollateral factor reductions can impact users in a number of ways. In particular, if a user's account health is low, this type of parameter change can render the account eligible for liquidation. \n\nIf a user rebalances their position ahead of a collateral factor reduction, they will avoid liquidation. For this reason, Gauntlet will provide notice to the community via communication channels that may include the forums and Twitter, among others.\n\nThat said, there is always some chance that a user will not monitor their account or fail to supply collateral in time, resulting in \"risk-off liquidations\".\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nIt is important that the community explicitly aligns on a desired maximum reduction to collateral factors per Compound proposal, as \"risk-off liquidations\" impact the user experience.\n\nCommunity input is also valuable because limits on CF reduction impose an important trade-off:\n1. A lower max CF reduction will minimize the impact to borrowers but at the cost of reducing the rate at which risk can be taken off. This, in turn, limits the extent to which leverage can be increased during favorable conditions, making Compound less capital efficient and coming at the cost of borrow volume. \n2. A higher max CF reduction will strengthen Compound's ability to maximize capital efficiency under favorable market conditions but increase the potential for risk-off liquidations.\n\n\n---\n\nThis Snapshot vote has the below options: Per Compound proposal, each collateral asset's collateral factor may be reduced by an absolute percentage of up to:\n* 5% (see point (2) above)\n* 4%\n* 3%\n* 2%\n* 1% (see point (1) above)\n* 0%\n* Abstain\n\nNote:\n* *This limit would **not** apply under severe conditions, such as a contract vulnerability.* \n* *It **would** apply to all collateral assets Gauntlet supports, including ETH, WBTC, DAI, &c. [2].*\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n## \n[1] Please find a detailed explanation of Gauntlet's Risk Management methodology [here](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c).\n\n[2] A complete list of currently supported assets can be found [here](https://gov.gauntlet.network/compound).\n",

      "content": "\nForum discussion can be found [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/reserve-factor-consensus-for-the-compound-protocol/3487).\n\n\nTo facilitate community discussion and establish consensus regarding the next steps on Reserve Factors for Compound II, Gauntlet provides the following 3 options. Below, we outline the tradeoffs for each option in more detail. Gauntlet recommends that options 1 and 3 are the most prudent options. Since adjusting Reserve Factors is as much a matter of business strategy as it is of market risk, it is important for the community to find consensus. \n\n\n1. **Decrease Reserve Factors by 0.025 for USDT and DAI -** since reserves are currently high enough to cover the 95% tail scenarios showing $0 VaR for all collateral assets, and borrows have sharply declined on the protocol, reducing Reserve Factors is an opportunity to bring interest rates close to the market rate with the goal of driving borrow activity while also gathering data around borrower and supplier elasticity. These assets are also not part of the initial Compound III roll-out and, therefore, relatively isolated from that market. \n    \n    ***Limitations and Tradeoffs***: Since we do not have data on borrower elasticity, we cannot model borrower behavior. If users are inelastic to interest rate changes, the reduced reserve factor might result in lost revenues for the protocol. This risk may be acceptable given the low borrow volume at the moment. \n    \n2. **Increase Reserve Factors by** **0.025** **for USDT and DAI** - proponents of this option may assume user behavior is inelastic to interest rates, therefore allowing the protocol to capture a larger share of the revenue. Any change in reserve factor would enable the community to gather data on user elasticity to build better models in the future. \n    \n    While we support either option to gather data and improve models, Gauntlet does not recommend this option since any user elasticity with respect to this change would push interest rates farther away from the market rate as liquidity leaves the protocol.\n    \n    ***Limitations and Tradeoffs***: same as above - since we do not have data on elasticity, we cannot model behavior. If users are elastic to this change, an increase in reserve factor could result in decreased revenues for the protocol, the extent to which is unknown given the limited data. \n    \n3. **Wait until Compound III is live** - with the changing dynamics to be brought on by Compound III (reserve factor will no longer be set as a global parameter), the community may decide to wait to change reserve factors. \n    \n    The **tradeoff** here is that we will collect no information on user elasticity. \n    \n\n\n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*\n\n",

      "title": "cETH Risk Mitigation",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal will make several changes to the cETH market on Compound v2 in preparation for the upcoming Ethereum merge and switch to POS consensus. This includes setting a borrow cap of 100,000 ETH, as well as updating the interest rate model to a jump rate model with much higher rates after exceeding 80% borrow utilization, up to a maximum of 1000% APR at 100% utilization.\n\n## Reasoning\n\nThe upcoming merge has the potential to cause disruption to ETH lending markets due to the possibility of receiving airdrops of ETH fork tokens. This may incentivize excessive borrowing from ETH lending pools, which leads to negative user experience for depositors who cannot withdraw funds when utilization reaches 100%, as well as safety concerns due to potential to interfere with liquidations of ETH collateralized positions. The proposed changes should help reduce risk of the cETH market reaching 100% utilization. See the [forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/proposal-adjust-eth-interest-rate-model/3493) for further details.\n\nThe proposal includes payments to proposal contributors, including 100 COMP to MakerDAO governance timelock for Block Analitica (Maker risk) team’s analysis, as well as 45 COMP to Arr00 for development work.",

      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust one (1) parameter for one (1) Compound asset.\n\n## Background\nGauntlet's simulation engine has ingested the latest market and liquidity data. This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-risk-level-consensus-check/2437) chosen by the Compound community. These parameter updates are the seventeenth of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations as part of [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dynamic-risk-parameters/2223).\n\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/risk-parameter-updates-2022-08-24/3521)\n\n\n## Motivation and Specification\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nOur parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Our parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).\n![](https://i.imgur.com/G1sfBdO.png)\n\n\n## Dashboard\n\n\nGauntlet has launched the [Compound Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/compound). The community should use the Dashboard to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Compound.\n\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nThese parameter changes increase borrow usage by 16 basis points and decrease LaR by $5.1M.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hIHcEEg.png)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

      "content": "# Compound UAV v3 Upgrade\n\nGFX Labs is proposing on behalf of Chainlink to upgrade the protocol's oracle contract (currently v2) to v3, which switches the anchor market from Uniswap v2 to v3. \n\n[Forum Post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/proposal-to-upgrade-to-uav-v3/3270/11?u=getty)\n\n* The new UniswapAnchoredView (UAV) no longer records and keeps observations but instead queries the respective Uniswap V3 pool’s observe function to get a TWATP with the set anchor period when it’s needed (i.e., when a reporter calls validate on the UAV).\n\n* The price of an asset in Uniswap V3 is a function of the “tick” of the pool. The formula is price = 1.0001^tick. The math required for conversion between posted prices and the Uniswap V3 TWATP and the UAV representation has been modified to support this. Relevant libraries (TickMath and FullMath) have been included from the Uniswap V3 codebase.\n\n* The tests from the original UAV have been adapted to the new Uniswap V3 architecture - i.e., observations/TWATP tests were removed. Hardhat (+typechain) has been implemented so real Uniswap V3 pools can be used via forked mainnet in tests and eliminate the need for mocking Uniswap V3 pools.\n\n* Chainlink has increased the Uniswap observation cardinality to 150 on pools that were below 150.\n\nDedaub & ABDK audits: [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IWj2BtpG9qsb7PBVaWyQSaQyISr9m_E7)\n\nOpen Zeppelin report: [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1usfoYjWtlvrf8Ca6akFDvITwHC-wk73Y/view?ts=6303d733) \n\n[Oracle Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xad47d5a59b6d1ca4dc3ebd53693fda7d7449f165#code)",

      "content": "## Background\nFollowing the two proposal which returned accidentally sent funds, this proposal will return 90% of the accidentally sent WBTC to a user that sent the WBTC to the Comptroller [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5a4e6a6f29894914be5250d793fa2bb6d98a01d13528ea0d1f39afa731934629). \n\n## Mechanics\nIn order to returns the accidentally sent funds, this proposal sets a transient Comptroller implementation which implements a sweep function. This proposal sweeps the desired tokens to the Timelock and then returns the Comptroller implementation to the current implementation. The Timelock then disburses the funds. On top of the WBTC, orphaned UNI, BAT, and SAI will be swept from the Comptroller to the Timelock. Arr00 will be granted a bounty of 89k cUNI (~1790 UNI), which is part of the fee collected by the protocol from returning accidentally sent funds in proposal 37.\n\n## Security\nThe execution of this proposal will not alter the Comptroller state at all—the method of a transient Comptroller implementation was chosen to reduce risk as much as possible. Additionally, there are [proposal simulations](https://github.com/arr00/compound-protocol/tree/2320ea601f150ba1f4d34a4111003f021bc2261b/spec/sim/0112-sweep-comptroller) which simulate proposal execution and normal market functionality afterword. Finally, the proposal was audited and signed off by Open Zeppelin as can be verified [here](https://gist.github.com/cylon56/752f9061713a8d737e526fdce4b85f1f?permalink_comment_id=4187802#gistcomment-4187802).\n\n[Discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/implement-ctoken-sweeptoken-and-return-accidentally-sent-funds/1147/51?u=arr00)",

      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust two (2) parameters for two (2) Compound assets.\n\n## Background\nGauntlet's simulation engine has ingested the latest market and liquidity data following the recent market crash. This proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-risk-level-consensus-check/2437) chosen by the Compound community. These parameter updates are the thirteenth of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations as part of [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dynamic-risk-parameters/2223/16).\n\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/risk-parameter-updates-2022-06-15/3323)\n\n\n## Motivation and Specification\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nOur parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Our parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OgUgsJe.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Dashboard\n\n\nGauntlet has launched the [Compound Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/compound). The community should use the Dashboard to understand better the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Compound.\n\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nThese parameter changes increase borrow usage by 11 basis points with no change in Value at Risk or Liquidations at Risk.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/M9SRF2g.png)\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

To outline our thinking behind this addition, we split lending parameter optimization into a two step process:\n\n* Balancing losses due to insolvency with capital efficiency\n* Balancing the tradeoff between increasing supplier APY and growing reserves to cover insolvency losses\n\nWe are now adding a layer to our existing simulation logic that allows us to reflect the second step of lending protocol risk management: building sufficient but not excessive reserves to absorb losses that do occur. Our model assumes the protocol would like to build reserves greater than insolvency losses by a small margin, and includes this as an optimization objective. As reserves are built and losses occur in the simulation, a higher setting for the reserve factor allows us to absorb more losses while maintaining reserve coverage, while a lower setting for the reserve factor would require losses to be managed more tightly.\n\n\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/gauntlet-reserve-factor-optimization-framework/3283)\n\n\n## Motivation and Specification\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nWe recommend decreasing reserve factors for USDC, USDT, and TUSD from 7.5% to 3.75%, and decreasing all other reserve factors by 500 bps (for example, decreasing ETH reserve factor from 20% to 15%). We previously proposed decreasing reserve factors for 17 total assets, but the maximum number of proposal changes is 10. As a result, we are recommending the 10 most impactful reserve factor decreases, based on expected annual reserves for each asset.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\nThe one-week rolling average VaR for Compound in a Black Thursday magnitude event is $0.30M.\n\nThe protocol has an existing reserve pool of $42.87M, broken down as follows:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rOA8xNd.jpg)\n\n\nThe protocol is expected to build reserves at a $3.86M annual rate should the reserve factors remain unchanged, broken down as follows:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LHb99ax.jpg)\n\n\nSince the existing pool and growth rate are more than sufficient to cover a very severe loss event, our analysis shows that the optimal level of reserve factors is well lower than they are currently. By implementing the recommended cuts, the protocol could reduce its estimated annual reserve growth rate from $3.86M to $2.33M, reallocating $1.53M of funds to suppliers and thus incentivizing more users to lock collateral in Compound. \n\n\n*By approving this proposal, you agree that any services provided by Gauntlet shall be governed by the terms of service available at gauntlet.network/tos.*",

Many top whale suppliers repaid some of their borrows during the crash, thus avoiding liquidations. As a result, Gauntlet's simulations reflect that Compound can prudently increase collateral factors post-crash.\n\nNote that we are proposing increasing collateral factors for the stablecoins USDC and DAI. Recursive borrowing has decreased in the past month for both assets. The partially recursive positions have a substantial amount of other collateral assets locked, thus leading to a low chance of insolvency in those positions, as our simulation results reflect. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/WXeWl1n.png)",

The new implementation has been deployed to [0x3363BAe2Fc44dA742Df13CD3ee94b6bB868ea376](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3363bae2fc44da742df13cd3ee94b6bb868ea376).\n\nThis is the final proposal to bring all upgradeable cTokens up to the new implementation. In addition to updating the implementation, it grants $350,000[1] worth of COMP to Equilibria for the upgrade work and 79,764.36 USDC to Compound Labs for the ChainSecrity audit of the protocol[2].\n\n[1] COMP value based on the current spot price at time of this proposal ($114)\n[2] ChainSecurity Payment Transaction can be viewed [here](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8aa026292f1bc869a1353b66d47673dbcf23cab2980e0d293fa3c7474caf17d0)\n\n## Changelog\nThese changes implement the following:\n\n* Upgrade the Solidity version of the cToken and related contracts to 0.8.10 - all contracts in the repo were changed to 0.8.10 but only the cTokens will be upgraded as part of upcoming governance proposals. This is due to the complexity of having multiple Solidity versions in the same repo.\n* Remove the usage of SafeMath and CarefulMath in favor of Solidity 0.8’s checked math - Solidity will now automatically revert when math errors occur (overflows, division by zero, etc)\n* Remove the custom errorCode return values in favor of reverts and custom errors - this allows for a more structured way to deal with errors rather than enum or string comparisons.\n\nThe previous upgrade can be seen here: [Proposal 101](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/101)\n\n## Development\nThe code changes can be viewed here: [Pull Request #152](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/152).\n\nAudits of these changes were completed by ChainSecurity and OpenZeppelin and all issues were either fixed or out of scope for this change.

These parameter updates are the tenth of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations as part of [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dynamic-risk-parameters/2223/16).\n\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/risk-parameter-updates-2022-04-20/3183)\n\n\n## Motivation and Specification\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nOur parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Our parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pOIFSQd.png)",

      "content": "The initial objective of the COMP rewards program was to distribute the token to our users. While this was an effective way to kickstart Compound and reward early users, the practice of COMP farming for profit has become very problematic.\n\nSince most COMP being distributed by the current rewards program is instantly sold off, existing users and token holders are at a great disservice. Their share of the protocol is being diluted for nothing other than farming COMP for profit. This COMP farming behavior is not the kind of activity that will bring value to the protocol, or for the existing users and token holders. Incentives need to be used to grow the protocol to the benefit of the protocol itself and its users and token holders.\n\nGoing forward, I believe it’s best to end the current COMP rewards program and to start a new one with the sole purpose of kickstarting new markets: kickstart rewards.\n\nThis proposal is the second step towards launching the new rewards program - **existing rewards are being slashed to 0**.\n\nFor more information and discussion, please visit the [discussion thread on the forums](https://www.comp.xyz/t/comp-reward-adjustments-v2/3074/).",

      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust two (2) parameters for two (2) Compound assets.\n\n## Background\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-risk-level-consensus-check/2437) chosen by the Compound community. These parameter updates are the ninth of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations as part of [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dynamic-risk-parameters/2223/16).\n\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/risk-parameter-updates-2022-03-29/3111)\n\n\n## Motivation and Specification\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nOur parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Our parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/d90n5g1.png)\n\n\n## Dashboard\n\n\nGauntlet has launched the [Compound Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/compound). The community should use the Dashboard to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Compound.\n\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\nEven though these changes result in less than 1 bp of increased Borrow Usage given the current TVLs, they will improve long-term capital efficiency as the protocol grows and more users supply YFI and SUSHI.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/S5OIfAF.png)",

This should reduce the likelihood of disruption to Compound's DAI and MKR markets, and also minimize risk to the wider defi ecosystem. \n\nMKR is not frequently borrowed, and based on historical demand across Aave and Compound this 5,000 token limit is unlikely to limit typical usage.\n\nSee the full discussion [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/reducing-mkr-borrow-cap/2959).",

      "title": "Update Low-TVL cToken Implementations",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal is a patch developed by Equilibria which updates the cToken implementation contract for 5 low TVL assets to a more recent Solidity version (0.8.10) and removes error codes in favor of reverts with custom errors. No other core logic changes are intended. The new implementation has been deployed to [0x3363BAe2Fc44dA742Df13CD3ee94b6bB868ea376](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3363bae2fc44da742df13cd3ee94b6bb868ea376).\n\n## Changelog\nThese changes implement the following:\n\n* Upgrade the Solidity version of the cToken and related contracts to 0.8.10 - all contracts in the repo were changed to 0.8.10 but only the cTokens will be upgraded as part of upcoming governance proposals. This is due to the complexity of having multiple Solidity versions in the same repo.\n* Remove the usage of SafeMath and CarefulMath in favor of Solidity 0.8’s checked math - Solidity will now automatically revert when math errors occur (overflows, division by zero, etc)\n* Remove the custom errorCode return values in favor of reverts and custom errors - this allows for a more structured way to deal with errors rather than enum or string comparisons.\n\nIt is important to note that the goal is to have no behavior changes in the happy path case, and to only move away from errorCodes and to revert in the failure case (both math errors and checks). All existing unit and scenario tests should pass with only changes to the error code cases.\n\nMore cTokens will be upgraded in a future proposal if this one passes and causes no issues.\n\n## Development\nThe code changes can be viewed here: [Pull Request #152](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/152).\n\nAudits of these changes were completed by ChainSecurity and OpenZeppelin and all issues were either fixed or out of scope for this change.

Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world.\n- The Nomic Foundation’s work will be focused on Ethereum’s developer platform with the objective of achieving a world-class developer experience, and generally improving Ethereum’s public goods support structures.\n- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software, with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users. Prominent teams relying on it include ENS, Uniswap, Optimism, OpenZeppelin, Aave, Balancer, Chainlink, Synthetix, and many more leading teams.\n- The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and, most importantly, build long-term infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, decreasing Ethereum’s dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components.\n- Seeking $30m in total funding from the ecosystem. Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures.\n- **We’re proposing to Compound Governance to make a contribution of $2m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.**\n## **Funding**\nThe Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we’re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it.\nThe Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we’re aiming to raise $15M more.\n## **Why Compound?**\nGenerally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we’ve approached and will continue approaching several protocols.\nThe projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create value for the entire ecosystem, including Compound. We’ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:\n1. Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat).\n2. Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem.\n3. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires.\n4. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built.\n5. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.\nWe believe this grows the market for everyone, including Compound, and we’d love to have the Compound DAO contribute $2m in funding to this community effort.",

      "title": "COMP Rewards Adjustments - Kickstart Rewards: Step One",
      "content": "The initial objective of the COMP rewards program was to distribute the token to our users. While this was an effective way to kickstart Compound and reward early users, the practice of COMP farming for profit has become very problematic.\n\nSince most COMP being distributed by the current rewards program is instantly sold off, existing users and token holders are at a great disservice. Their share of the protocol is being diluted for nothing other than farming COMP for profit. This COMP farming behavior is not the kind of activity that will bring value to the protocol, or for the existing users and token holders. Incentives need to be used to grow the protocol to the benefit of the protocol itself and its users and token holders.\n\nGoing forward, I believe it’s best to end the current COMP rewards program and to start a new one with the sole purpose of kickstarting new markets: kickstart rewards.\n\nThis proposal is the first step towards launching the new rewards program - **existing rewards are being cut by 50%**.\n\nFor more information and discussion, please visit the [discussion thread on the forums](https://www.comp.xyz/t/comp-reward-adjustments-v2/3074/).",

      "content": "## **Summary**\n- Nomic Labs, the team behind Hardhat, has become the Nomic Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum. Our mission is to empower developers to decentralize the world.\n- The Nomic Foundation’s work will be focused on Ethereum’s developer platform with the objective of achieving a world-class developer experience, and generally improving Ethereum’s public goods support structures.\n- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) is the de facto standard developer tool used to build Ethereum software, with more than 23000 Github repositories using it and tens of thousands of active users. Prominent teams relying on it include ENS, Uniswap, Optimism, OpenZeppelin, Aave, Balancer, Chainlink, Synthetix, and many more leading teams.\n- The new foundation will expand the Hardhat suite of tools and, most importantly, build long-term infrastructure to catalyze organic growth in the Ethereum tooling ecosystem, decreasing Ethereum’s dependence on any one organization to build and maintain core development platform components.\n- Seeking $30m in total funding from the ecosystem. Donations of $15M already secured by the Ethereum Foundation, Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, a16z, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, a16z, and Kaszek Ventures.\n- **We’re proposing to Compound Governance to make a contribution of $5m to the Nomic Foundation to support its mission.**\n\n## **Funding**\nThe Nomic Foundation aims to benefit the entire Ethereum ecosystem, which is why we’re fundraising across multiple organizations and individuals within it.\nThe Ethereum Foundation is leading this round of contributions with $8M, alongside contributions from Vitalik Buterin, Coinbase, Consensys, The Graph, Polygon, Chainlink, Gnosis, a16z, a_capital, and Kaszek Ventures. These donors make up $15M, and we’re aiming to raise $15M more.\n\n## **Why Compound?**\nGenerally, we think that allocating capital to the Nomic Foundation makes strategic sense for any protocol treasury that is aligned long term with the growth of Ethereum, and we’ve approached and will continue approaching several protocols.\nThe projects that the Nomic Foundation will deliver will create value for the entire ecosystem, including Compound. We’ll provide services to the Ethereum community that will:\n1. Continue the maintenance of critical infrastructure used to build most protocols (Hardhat).\n2. Increase developer productivity for every team in the ecosystem.\n3. Accelerate developer onboarding to Ethereum, increasing the size of the experienced engineering hiring pool and making time-to-productivity shorter for new hires.\n4. Accelerate the pace of innovation and the number of products being built.\n5. Increase market volume driven by new users and new products.\nWe believe this grows the market for everyone, including Compound, and we’d love to have the Compound DAO contribute $5m in funding to this community effort.",

These parameter updates are the eighth of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations as part of [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dynamic-risk-parameters/2223/16).\n\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/risk-parameter-updates-2022-03-08/3065)\n\n\n## Motivation and Specification\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to maintain the overall risk tolerance of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets.\n\nOur parameter recommendations are driven by an optimization function that balances 3 core metrics: insolvencies, liquidations, and borrow usage. Our parameter recommendations seek to optimize for this objective function. For more details, please see [Gauntlet's Parameter Recommendation Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-parameter-recommendation-methodology-8591478a0c1c) and [Gauntlet's Model Methodology](https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/gauntlets-model-methodology-ea150ff0bafd).\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DvyaAYu.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Dashboard\n\n\nGauntlet has launched the [Compound Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/compound). The community should use the Dashboard to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Compound.\n\n\nValue at Risk represents the 95th percentile **insolvency value** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event. \n\nLiquidations at Risk represents the 95th percentile **liquidation volume** that occurs from simulations we run over a range of volatilities to approximate a tail event.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ClBtga8.png)\n",

      "content": "[MATIC](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7d1afa7b718fb893db30a3abc0cfc608aacfebb0#code) is the ecosystem token of [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) (previously Matic) - an EVM compatible sidechain & L2 project with a current TVL of more than [$4B](https://dappradar.com/defi/protocol/polygon) and 7000+ dapps deployed across DeFi, NFT, Gaming, and DAO spaces. Polygon's scope and vision are to become an Ethereum scaling aggregator.\n\nWith a market cap of $11BB and +$300MM daily exchange volume, [MATIC](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polygon#markets) is a strong asset to be listed on Compound. \n\nInterestingly, MATIC has significant usage on [Aave Polygon](https://app.aave.com/#/markets) at $280MM in liquidity but isn't supported by Aave's mainnet contracts. This is an opportunity for Compound to become the mainnet destination for MATIC. \n\nIt should be noted this asset addition has not been reviewed by Open Zeppelin. Given that MATIC is a well-established contract and the ctoken contract utilizes the current standard, there is a good precedent to support the asset addition. As usual, the proposal is to list MATIC with a 0 collateral factor. This allows Compound to onboard assets incrementally and safely.\n\n[Forum thread](https://www.comp.xyz/t/add-market-matic/2179)\n\nThe proposal also updates the protocol's oracle from [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x046728da7cb8272284238bd3e47909823d63a58d#code) to [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x65c816077C29b557BEE980ae3cC2dCE80204A0C5#code). The contract code is identical, all existing markets retain the same configuration, and we introduce FRAX, LUSD, and RAI to the mix. \n\nThese have been added to the oracle on a best-efforts basis and exist for governance's consideration in future asset-specific governance votes. Their addition to the oracle is not our endorsement or opposition for their addition to the protocol. They are there so votes can occur to add the assets to the protocol, and the full merits of each asset should be considered at that time.",

      "title": "Update cSUSHI cToken Implementation",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal is a patch developed by Equilibria which updates the cToken implementation contract for cSUSHI to a more recent\nSolidity version (0.8.6) and removes error codes in favor of reverts with custom errors. No other core logic changes are\nintended. The new implementation has been deployed to [0xFcB924Ae46C7DDc6ad4F873a59ad6F3b5A2e20d5](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfcb924ae46c7ddc6ad4f873a59ad6f3b5a2e20d5)\n\n## Changelog\nThese changes implement the following:\n\n* Upgrade the Solidity version of the cToken and related contracts to 0.8.6 - all contracts in the repo were changed to 0.8.6 but only the cTokens will be upgraded as part of upcoming governance proposals. This is due to the complexity of having multiple Solidity versions in the same repo.\n* Remove the usage of SafeMath and CarefulMath in favor of Solidity 0.8’s checked math - Solidity will now automatically revert when math errors occur (overflows, division by zero, etc)\n* Remove the custom errorCode return values in favor of reverts and custom errors - this allows for a more structured way to deal with errors rather than enum or string comparisons.\n\nIt is important to note that the goal is to have no behavior changes in the happy path case, and to only move away from errorCodes and to revert in the failure case (both math errors and checks). All existing unit and scenario tests should pass with only changes to the error code cases.\n\nMore cTokens will be upgraded in a future proposal if this one passes and causes no issues.\n\n## Development\nThe code changes can be viewed here: [Pull Request #152](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/152).\n\nAn audit was completed by the [ChainSecurity Team](https://chainsecurity.com/security-audit/compound-ctoken) and all issues\nwere either fixed or out of scope for this change.

These parameter updates are the sixth of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations as part of [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dynamic-risk-parameters/2223/16).\n\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/risk-parameter-updates-2021-12-23-and-risk-dashboard-bug-fix/2799)\n\n\n## Motivation and Specification\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to level set assets to a Moderate risk level of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Note that some are different from the original [risk level consensus check](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-risk-level-consensus-check/2437) as market conditions have changed.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2LKqHgh.png)\n\n\n## Dashboard\n\n\nGauntlet has launched the [Compound Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/compound). The community should use the Dashboard to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Compound.\n\n\nAs shown on our dashboard, these changes will increase Value at Risk by $59.3M (10.3%) and increase the borrow usage by 5 basis points. Note that all the VaR is projected to be liquidations that can be safely absorbed by the market.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/OmPyMsT.png)",

      "title": "Continuous Security Engineering for Compound",
      "content": "# Executive summary\n\nCompound seeks to prevent insecure proposals from being merged via the decentralized governance process. Trail of Bits will provide comprehensive software assurance services to mitigate this risk across three specific activities: consulting services, security engineering, and process creation.\n\nWe believe it is essential to create an easy-to-follow process with highly robust tools that makes security transparent, with or without a code review from Trail of Bits. We consider the primary goal as building capacity in the Compound ecosystem to secure itself. To that end, we will provide engineering efforts to develop critical security infrastructure and processes.\n\nTrail of Bits will be paid the equivalent of $1 million USD in COMP every quarter for one year to provide the baseline services. This payment is all-inclusive of all services defined in the proposal.\n\nTrail of Bits spoke on Discord at the Compound Community Dev Call and carved out [my part of the presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GYQ_A5EewK73ZtLZ_wvKpPFLYwCvVznX/view?usp=sharing) so you can listen to it briefly since it may add color to the proposal.\n\n# Goals and Non-Goals\n\nGoals of this effort include:\n\n* Prevent insecure code from being merged into Compound through the governance process, and ensure that any remaining risks of proposals under consideration are well known before a vote. Compound desires services that eliminate and illuminate these risks.\n* Provide first-class security tools and analytical capabilities to Compound developers. Compound developers must have every opportunity to analyze their code and understand its security ramifications. Compound desires a variety of tools that enable thorough inspection of code by developers and users.\n* Create repeatable processes that build capacity for security and avoid dependence on external audits or third-party services for security. Security efforts should result in higher quality code being developed by the Compound community over time through the adoption of consistent processes.\n\nNon-goals of this effort include:\n\n* Deploy, configure, or maintain on-chain monitoring software. This goal does not address the security of governance proposals. These systems are an active field of research, may apply to fewer attacks than expected, or may have undesirable performance costs. Instead, we will commit to evaluating their opportunities and limitations during the project.\n* Further development of the bug bounty program. We support the formation of a [bug bounty proposal](https://www.comp.xyz/t/bug-bounty-program-for-compound-proposals/2590) to specifically address this issue. We will provide consultative advice to this proposal based on our years of [experience](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/01/14/on-bounties-and-boffins/) seeing both ends of the bounty ecosystem.\n\n# Description of the Services\n\n## 1. Consulting services\n\nTrail of Bits will provide at least one full-time security engineer, with additional engineers supporting the project as needed, to perform the following consulting services:\n\n* **Maintain a presence on Discord and the Compound forums.** We will actively engage in conversation, reach out to developers as needed, and identify any new proposals.\n* **Provide proposal authors with 1:1 counseling sessions.** We will host a video call with the author to understand their goals and provide immediate feedback, including on the architectural design of their proposal and suggestions to reduce complexity.\n* **Review and report any identified security issues in the code for proposals.** We will describe the issue, a scenario to abuse it, and a recommendation to address it. We will work with proposal authors to validate fixes that result from these reports.\n* **Define security properties for proposals.** We will work with the authors to provide reasonable security invariants alongside the proposal and tests for them in Certora, Echidna, or other tools, as appropriate for the specific invariants under test.\n* **Document “Security Considerations” for every proposal.** We will contribute a standardized section to reviewed proposals to inform developers and users of limitations, risks, or other considerations to form an opinion about their vote on it.\n* **Provide our analysis directly to the community.** Before a vote on any governance issue, we will host a public community call, walk attendees through the documented Security Considerations, and run test suites, fully informing their decisions to vote.\n* **Host bi-weekly Office Hours with developers.** We will cover testing and verification tools, demonstrate new security processes and tools for Compound, and solicit feedback for new areas of development and guidance needed by the community.\n* **Evaluate new security techniques for adoption by Compound.** We will perform detailed evaluations of the applicability of these techniques *directly on the Compound codebase*, sharing our empirical results of efficacy and utility.\n* **Ad-hoc services sourced from across Trail of Bits**, as needed. This includes expertise from our separate teams for cryptography, application security, cloud-native security, threat modeling, machine learning, and other research teams. Our firm employs more than 80 researchers servicing clients in tech, defense, and finance on high-risk security challenges.\n\n## 2. Security engineering\n\nTrail of Bits will engineer solutions in software to critical security risks faced by Compound. We will ensure that first-class security tools are available, easy to use, and customized for use on Compound, with knowledge of Compound-specific risks built in.\n\n* **Ensure that [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither), our static analysis framework, and [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna), our rapid security property tester, always work on Compound code.** These security tools are delicate machines that must ingest all code possible to write in Solidity and EVM. We will ensure that no breaking changes affect Compound for an extended period of time and these tools always \"just work.\"\n* **Customize Slither and Echidna to the Compound codebase.** We will extend each tool to understand Compound’s architecture, expected security properties, and third-party protocols, vastly enhancing their depth of results. For example, we can build static analyses that understand and aggregate data from Certora properties or that understand specific Compound interfaces.\n* **Customize Slither to evaluate the security of upgrades.** Upgradeability exposes low-level complexity with possibly disastrous results. Slither already [evaluates for 17 such flaws](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Upgradeability-Checks), and we will enhance this analysis with Compound-specific conditions.\n* **Develop scaffolding for new proposals with pre-integrated security analyses** from Slither, Echidna, Certora, or others, as appropriate. These templates will provide secure beginnings for parameter changes, new tokens, protocol features, and governance changes.\n* **Continuously define and evaluate security properties across the Compound codebase** with analyses from Slither, Echidna, Certora, or other techniques, as appropriate. New proposals may expose under-specified areas of Compound that require greater formalization. We will work to fill in these gaps with new properties.\n\n## 3. Repeatable processes\n\nTrail of Bits will build the capacity of the Compound community to secure itself, minimizing dependency on external security audits for security and most efficiently using their time when engaged. We will define and socialize repeatable processes that encapsulate common tasks with security integrated within them. Adoption of these processes will set a floor on proposal quality, continuously secure proposals regardless of security auditor review, and improve the quality of proposals over time.\n\n* **Design a repeatable process for starting a new proposal.** We will develop onboarding guidance for developers that describes the end-to-end process for securely creating new proposals. Touchpoints will include security training, using pre-created templates, example security properties, guidance on tools, self-assessment, engaging with Trail of Bits for code review.\n* **Design a repeatable process for proposal [self-assessment](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/assessments/guide/self-assessment.md)**. We will provide guidance to assess the security of proposals before sharing them publicly. This will facilitate more effective conversations about security with the community and Trail of Bits, knowing that an initial baseline has been met.\n* **Design a repeatable process for risk assessment by the community.** We will share the risk factors that security experts focus on when reviewing proposals and document steps to run testing and verification tools, thus providing a map for those voting on proposals to become better informed and obtain empirical evidence.\n* **Design a repeatable process for evaluating [third-party protocol integration risks](https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/blob/master/development-guidelines/token_integration.md).** We will design a repeatable process to investigate the security considerations of new token implementations and other linkages to DeFi building blocks from Compound. We will document existing pitfalls and concerns in third-party code already used by Compound, and facilitate the discovery and documentation of others.\n* **Design a repeatable process for other protocols to securely integrate with Compound.** In the reverse of the above, we will describe security considerations for DeFi users of Compound. In our mind, any compromise involving Compound, even if it does not originate from our own code, will compromise its reputation.\n* **Regularly update a “treasure map” for bug hunting in Compound.** We will guide other security researchers to less specified, more risky areas of the code. We will regularly report statistics on these identified hotspots, such as % coverage for specifications.\n\n# Risks\n\nCompound may have unknown, latent security vulnerabilities already present in the code. Our proposal focuses on new code added to Compound and, therefore, these issues may continue undiscovered. To mitigate this risk, we have included a) a task focused on specifying new security properties, as needed, and b) a task to build a treasure map to aid other bug hunters.\n\nCOMP holders may vote for proposals that contain documented security risk or that are otherwise highly risky, considering the reward to be greater in that circumstance. To mitigate this risk, we will a) add documented Security Considerations to every proposal and b) host a community call to walk through those considerations, demonstrate how to run included test suites, and evaluate the coverage of them.\n\nCompound is highly complex and new proposals may use new features of Solidity or combine features of Solidity in ways that break the security tools upon which it depends. To mitigate this risk, Trail of Bits has specifically prioritized the development and testing of new features for Slither and Echidna against the Compound codebase.\n\nProposals may require swift approval without waiting for input from Trail of Bits, or input from Trail of Bits may be otherwise unavailable within the timeframe required due to unknown circumstances. To mitigate this risk, Trail of Bits has proposed a robust sequence of processes and tools for the community to enhance trust in themselves and better understand the risks of their actions.\n\n# Financial Terms\n\nTrail of Bits will be streamed the equivalent of $4 million USD in COMP (at today's price) for one year to provide the services. This payment is all-inclusive of all services defined in the proposal.",

Coordinate the creation of documented security checklists and requirements that can be shared with all proposal authors\n4. Implement an open security monitoring and security dashboard solution that will allow the community to validate security \n5. Integrate, support, and analyze other possible future important security program components such as formal verification, bug bounties, and white hat monitoring approved by the DAO.  \n\nThe combined effort of the OpenZeppelin team, the Security Advisor, and the Compound community will thereby reduce potential security risks and further assure the DAOs trusted reputation.\n\n**OpenZeppelin has revised its original proposal to focus on community feedback and excludes performance fees. OpenZeppelin’s fee will be the equivalent of $1 million USD in COMP every quarter for one year. This fee covers all services defined in the proposal. Payment will be made using a streaming grant based on recommendations given by community member feedback on the forum. Please see our full revised proposal here:**\n\n**[OZ Final Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVeQ5rbdzN2m7AR06eF-lbQHwFKZdvDj7WEiyMGdBdA/edit?usp=sharing)**\n\nWe believe that no other firm in the market can bring the same breadth and depth of offerings to the DAO.  We provide best-in-class continuous auditing and security advisory services; established leadership in secure development and secure operations; and external relationships and partnerships at a cost to value no other firm can match. \n\nWe would be honored to partner with the Compound DAO to not only deliver continuous auditing but to also work together to be leaders and innovators in how to securely and efficiently run an effective DAO security program!\n\n### Voting Instructions: [Audit Selection Process](https://www.comp.xyz/t/auditing-compound-protocol/2543/35)\n\nAll three audit proposals will be submitted to governance and voted on by the community. The proposal with the most \"For\" votes will win and the community multisig will then cancel the losing proposals after the vote is completed. Please only vote YES once for your preferred proposal.\n\nSee the [complete Forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/auditing-compound-protocol/2543) for more details",

      "content": "# Overview\n\nWe live in a new world where more and more DAOs are in control of a project. Ensuring that safe choices are made is a major challenge and DAOs have been exploring different approaches. According to current proposals, Compound would effectively outsource their security to a vendor who would take care of various security-related needs.\n\nWe believe that this approach is not the route to take. The chosen audit company would become a critical dependency for the protocol. The suggested solutions with their intransparent, quarterly, lump-sum payment for a mix of services do not focus on the most effective tools. Hence, we would like to suggest a process that can leverage the strength of the security community.\nThe main security challenge for a protocol like Compound is the growing complexity that needs to be taken into account with every change.\n\n* Compound needs to ensure compatibility, failure to do so can have significant consequences.\n* Integrations must not be affected by the proposed changes.\n* Compound protocol grows and contracts must still interact correctly. \n\nOverall, we conclude that such systems exhibit quadratic complexity growth. To tackle this, we aim for scalability. Furthermore, we believe that the security can best be ensured by a broad base of security providers. This prevents any form of vendor lock-in and conflicts of interest, while allowing to combine the strengths of different providers.\n\n# Process in a Nutshell\n\nWith this proposal, Compound Governance will allocate the necessary funds to onboard two independent top-tier auditors at current market prices assuming that each one of them provides the capacity to review 150% of the RFPs voted on in 2021, providing in total a capacity of 300% over the needs of 2021.\n\nTo ensure that Compound has competent code auditors at their proposal, the following process would be enacted:\n\n* Compound Governance votes in several code reviewers each year to onboard into auditing through a paid training phase.\n* Auditors apply to become wardens of Compound by providing:\n  * An example of how a code review for the Comptroller and the cToken would be performed, detailing methods and time required.\n  * The cost and amount of hours reserved for Compound per quarter, which are if accepted guaranteed to be paid by Compound.\n  * The expected compensation for the training phase.\n* Onboarding code reviewers can also greatly benefit from the existing audit suite which contains many relevant attack scenarios.\n* Any time reserved for Compound not spent on reviewing code or RFPs is used to improve this audit suite.\n* Auditors who are selected by Governance and complete the training take shared ownership of the audit suite and collectively improve the coverage.\n* Delivering good work in improving the Compound Audit Suite will likely be used to evaluate the quality of the auditor which aligns interests long-term by increasing the likelihood of being voted in again next year.\n\nThe following process focuses on prevention and consists of 5 steps to be executed for each RFP:\n\n1. Early feedback during RFP stage with code reviewers adding security consideration paragraphs\n2. Perform thorough code review of newly developed code\n3. Develop an audit suite\n4. Leverage tool-based analysis where efficiently possible\n5. Perform the Proposal Verification\n\n# Benefits of the Audit Suite\n\nConsidering all the benefits explained in detail in the forum post, we believe that the audit suite can provide the necessary scalability by capturing a lot of the growing complexity. It requires an initial investment to build it up, but we consider it worthwhile.\n\n# Cost & Next Steps\n\nFor the first year, the total cost per auditor is expected to not exceed $1’370’000, which would cover 8 auditor-weeks of initial training ($170’000 one-time) and 24 auditor-days per month (quarterly fee of $300’000). This amount of auditor-days will cover the needs of Compound if 150% the capacity of 2021 will be required. For administration and maintenance of the program, an independent service provider with expertise in project management and IT safety will be chosen by Compound Governance with a compensation of $80’000 / year.\nTo ensure that all of these services can be provided with high quality, ChainSecurity commits to provide an offer as one of the auditors not exceeding the caps mentioned above. We will also source at least one independent provider to maintain the program for consideration by Compound Governance and hand over control over the Gnosis Safe MultiSig to this provider once they are confirmed by Compound Governance.\nThe initial request will cover the initial training for two auditors ($340’000 in COMP) and a streaming grant to cover audit cost at the cap for two auditors and the project maintainer ($620’000 per quarter) at $200 / COMP and 6500 blocks/day. A proposal for adjustment of the streaming grant to align COMP value with the value in USD will be done quarterly. Funds remaining at the end of the year in the MultiSig will be returned to Compound Governance.\n\n# Closing words\n\nOur suggestion incentivizes broad participation from small to large security companies. Thereby, it broadens the base of experts in Compound and leverages proven techniques. Using the audit suite, we can aggregate the knowledge and insights from multiple audits (instead of only relying on the last audit) and thereby tackle the growing complexity. We believe that this provides a viable long-term solution.\nWhile even a single audit company chosen to shepherd the protocol could write such an audit suite, only by having multiple companies who rely on each other to have covered critical parts of the system enforces that a public, high-quality audit suite gets created. It also allows every security provider to play to their strengths when contributing. Lastly, it allows a decentralized verification of proposals by any community member.\n\n# Reference\n[Forum post with details](https://www.comp.xyz/t/auditing-compound-protocol/2543/27?u=chainsecurity)",

These parameter updates are the fifth of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations as part of [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dynamic-risk-parameters/2223/16).\n\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/risk-parameter-updates-2021-12-11/2745)\n\n\n## Motivation and Specification\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to level set assets to a Moderate risk level of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Note that some are different from the original [risk level consensus check](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-risk-level-consensus-check/2437) as market conditions have changed.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zfOShU8.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n## Dashboard\n\n\nGauntlet has launched the [Compound Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/compound). The community should use the Dashboard to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Compound.\n\n\nAs shown below, VaR has increased considerably since our last recommendations, up to over $1B. This is mostly due to increased market volatility and lower collateralization ratios amongst the top borrowers. We note however that all the VaR is projected to be liquidations that can be safely absorbed by the market. This new set of parameter updates will slightly increase VaR, but meaningfully increase borrow usage and long-term reserves.\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/cjv97dA.png)",

      "content": "## Simple Summary\n\nA proposal to adjust four (4) total parameters across four (4) Compound assets.\n\n\n## Background\nThis proposal is a batch update of risk parameters to align with the [Moderate risk level](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-risk-level-consensus-check/2437) chosen by the Compound community. These parameter updates are the third of Gauntlet's regular parameter recommendations as part of [Dynamic Risk Parameters](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dynamic-risk-parameters/2223/16).\n\n\n[Full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/risk-parameter-updates-2021-11-17/2625)\n\n\n## Motivation and Specification\n\nThis set of parameter updates seeks to level set assets to a Moderate risk level of the protocol while making risk trade-offs between specific assets. Note that some are different from the original [risk level consensus check](https://www.comp.xyz/t/community-risk-level-consensus-check/2437) as market conditions have changed.\n\nIn order to react to changing market conditions, our analysis recommends decreasing the collateral factors for BAT and ZRX while increasing collateral factors for ETH and DAI. Both BAT and ZRX have increased in volatility and decreased in volume since our last parameter changes. As shown on our dashboard, these changes will slightly increase VaR, but the corresponding increase in borrow usage is substantial. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jXbgC5y.png)\n\n\n\n## Dashboard\n\n\nGauntlet has launched the [Compound Risk Dashboard](https://gov.gauntlet.network/compound). The community should use the Dashboard to better understand the updated parameter suggestions and general market risk in Compound.\n\nAs shown below, this set of parameter updates will slightly increase VaR, but meaningfully increase borrow usage.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DeZz4Mj.png)",

      "content": "# Summary: \n\n\n## Goal\n\nImplement Security Solutions to prevent and mitigate loss of funds resulting from security risks introduced by community-proposed upgrades to the Compound protocol.\n\n\n## Problem\n\nAs evidenced in recent market events and specifically Proposal 62, governance upgrades can introduce new security risk vectors which could result in reputational damage to the protocol and possible loss of user funds. Security is a continuous effort and should therefore be seen and addressed from a holistic, continuous perspective.\n\n\n## Background\n\nFor the past two years, OpenZeppelin has worked formally and informally with Compound to perform [10+ security audits](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/?s=compound), develop a [standardized version of GovernorAlpha and GovernorBravo contracts](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/governor-smart-contract/), introduce security best practices for [safer governance systems](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/smart-contract-security-guidelines-4-strategies-for-safer-governance-systems/), and develop bespoke [threat detection agent scripts](https://github.com/forta-protocol/forta-agent-examples/tree/master/compound-ts) monitoring Compound.\n\nAs the community assumes greater responsibility for the protocol and the stakes become higher, Compound's decentralized phase of growth demands comprehensive and continuous security processes to thrive.\n\n\n## Contributor grant\n\nOpenZeppelin is requesting a streaming grant for the Security Solutions retainer fee to begin implementation of a comprehensive set of best-in-class Security Solutions throughout all stages of the Compound governance proposal lifecycle, the elements of which include:\n\n\n\n* Protocol Security Officer to provide advisory services and recommendations on improvements to the governance process (specifically in the area of incident and emergency response)\n* Security Training and tailored community support specifically designed to educate the community to security best practices and threats in the DeFi space related to the Compound protocol\n* Continuous Audits of all new code introduced by governance proposals\n* Continuous Threat Monitoring of the Compound Protocol\n\n[See full proposal and forum discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/auditing-compound-protocol/2543)\n\nStarting March 30, 2022,  and after further feedback from the Community, OpenZeppelin, will create an additional proposal to cover the performance fee payment in accordance with the formula outlined in the full proposal.\n\n\n## References\n\n- Forum Discussion on reviewing large code changes: [https://www.comp.xyz/t/more-rigorous-process-on-reviewing-large-code-changes-re-comp-bug-9-29-21/2326/2](https://www.comp.xyz/t/more-rigorous-process-on-reviewing-large-code-changes-re-comp-bug-9-29-21/2326/2)\n\n- Patch for Proposal 63: https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-proposal-63-temporary-patch-for-comp-distribution-bug-9-29-21/2327",

A series of follow-up proposals will guide the community in finalizing the total amount, the distribution model, and the way in which the tokens are distributed.\n- FAILS: The community will abandon its efforts of this initiative.\n\nA quick summary in support and opposition of this initiative:\n- FOR: Early users were key in Compound's success. Their early use of the protocol shaped it to be what it is today, and those users should be given the power to continue shaping the protocol. Compound should continue to decentralize ownership of the protocol by distributing voting power amongst its early community members and users.\n- AGAINST: Compound should use the tokens in the treasury as incentives for new work to continue growing the protocol.\n\nNote: Since governance proposals require actions, a nil action has been provided.\n\n## Credits\n\nAllthecolors et al.\n\n## References\n- [Forums thread](https://www.comp.xyz/t/should-compound-retroactively-airdrop-tokens-to-early-users/595)",

This function behaves the following way:\n- If the user's amount of accrued COMP is greater than the amount they over-accrued, the amount over-accrued is subtracted from their accrued amount (compAccrued).\n- If the user's amount of accrued COMP is less than the amount they over-accrued (i.e. they successfully claimed more COMP than they should have), their accrued amount (compAccrued) is set to 0 and the difference (i.e. what they owe the protocol) is saved to compReceivable. This new storage variable is only used for record-keeping at the moment.\n- An event - CompReceivableUpdated - is emitted when compReceivable is updated.\n- An event - CompAccruedAdjusted - is emitted when this function updates compAccrued.\n\nNote: Record-keeping for the users who _successfully claimed more COMP than they should have and then subsequently returned the funds_ will have to be updated in a different proposal.\n\nSince this proposal corrects all of the amounts of over-accrued COMP, the functionality of claimComp has been restored for all users.\n\nUpon execution of this proposal, Compound protocol will return to its fully functioning state.\n\n## Verification\n\nEveryone is encouraged to verify that the list of users along with their over-accrued amounts exactly matches the output of [the script](https://github.com/TylerEther/compound-tools/blob/main/scripts/proposal-62-bug/find-affected-accounts.js) used to create this list.\n\n## Review\n\nThis proposal has only been thoroughly reviewed by myself, so I urge everyone to also thoroughly review this proposal before voting on it.\n\nThe proposal has been simulated from a fork of mainnet at block #13380217. The simulation passes with the proposal behaving exactly as expected.\n\n## Credits\n\nTylerEther (me)\n\n## References\n- [Forums - Proposal 65 discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/proposal-65-correct-over-accrued-comp/2428)\n- [Forums - Proposal 64 analysis](https://www.comp.xyz/t/analysis-of-proposal-64/2384/2?u=tylerether)\n- [Proposal simulation](https://github.com/TylerEther/compound-protocol/blob/fix-bad-comp-accruals/spec/sim/0065-correct-bad-comp-accruals/hypothetical_mainnet_upgrade.scen)\n- [Compound tools repository](https://github.com/TylerEther/compound-tools) hosting the [script used to create the list of affected users and their over-accrued amounts](https://github.com/TylerEther/compound-tools/blob/main/scripts/proposal-62-bug/find-affected-accounts.js)\n- [Comptroller - Etherscan code](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBafE01ff935C7305907c33BF824352eE5979B526#code)",

      "title": "Split COMP rewards distribution and bug fixes",
      "content": "This proposal completes RFP 15: Dynamic COMP reward distribution as well as fixes a few bugs.\n\n## Split COMP rewards distribution\n\n### Problem\n\nAt the moment, the COMP rewards rate for any single market is applied at the same rate for both suppliers and borrowers. This creates undesirable market conditions such as, but not limited to, negative interest rates when borrowing various assets.\n\nAn example is the WBTC market - we want to distribute COMP rewards for suppliers, but since this distribution rate applies at the same rate for both borrowers and suppliers, we end up with WBTC being borrowed at a negative interest rate. The same applies to most non-stablecoin markets.\n\n### Solution\n\nThis proposal changes the Comptroller logic to have two different COMP distribution rates for each and every market - borrow-side (_compBorrowSpeeds_) rate and supply-side (_compSupplySpeeds_) rate.\n\nThe function `Comptroller._setCompSpeeds(CToken[],uint256[],uint256[])` is introduced to enable governance to set these differing rates.\n\nExample usage: `Comptroller._setCompSpeeds([cUSDC],[0],[1e18])` - will set the COMP rewards for supplying USDC at 0 COMP per block, and for borrowing at 1 COMP per block.\n\n## COMP rewards distribution bug fixes\n\nThis proposal fixes the following bugs:\n- Market state indices were not being set when COMP rewards are added to already active markets. [[Bug 1](https://www.comp.xyz/t/comptroller-compspeed-bug/2111)]\n- COMP rewards were distributed for periods preceding when the distribution rate is set. [[Bug 2](https://www.comp.xyz/t/comptroller-compspeed-bug/2111)]\n- Borrowers were having to poke their borrow to accrue rewards if they borrowed before rewards rates were set. [[Bug 3](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/144/commits/f6d717bb78bef0c9851ad672f7b9aa1d90b0f00a)]\n\n## Technical changes\n- `Comptroller#compSpeeds` storage variable is no longer being used and has been effectively deleted. It's replaced by `Comptroller#compBorrowSpeeds` and `Comptroller#compSupplySpeeds`. This proposal copies the current rates into the new storage variables.\n- `Comptroller#_setCompSpeed(CToken,uint256)` function has been removed and replaced by `Comptroller#_setCompSpeeds(CToken[],uint256[],uint256[])`. This new function allows COMP rewards rates for multiple markets to be set with a single call.\n- An upgrade hook initializes all non-initialized market state indices (initial index is 1e36).\n- When new markets are added, their state indices are now properly initialized (used to use lazy initialization which caused many problems).\n\n## Other notable changes\n- Depositing now uses slightly less gas after a user's initial deposit.\n- Calling `Comptroller#claimComp` unfortunately uses a lot more gas to account for uninitialized borrow state indices. It's recommended to specify which markets (and which sides) to claim COMP in rather than claiming across all markets simultaneously.\n- Flywheel tests have been updated and expanded upon to prevent the bugs fixed in this proposal from occurring again.\n- These changes have been live on the Ropsten testnet for nearly a month and everything is working as expected.\n\n## Credits\n- Arr00: initial code supporting split COMP rewards; flywheel test re-writes\n- Getty: bugs 1 and 2 diagnosis help and disclosure\n- Elee: bugs 1 and 2 diagnosis help, fixing, and disclosure\n- Coburn: bug 3 identification; test case\n- Compound Labs (especially Jared): reviewing, guidance, general help, and coordination\n- TylerEther (me): full implementation of split COMP rewards; testing infrastructure changes; bugs 1 and 2 identification, diagnosis, fixing, and disclosure; bug 3 fix; overall coordination; general testing; addition of many new test cases; proposal\n\n## References\n- [GitHub PR](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/144/)\n- [Proposal simulation](https://github.com/TylerEther/compound-protocol/blob/f73b29373eb65cedf24896d7be46eed38435fc91/spec/sim/0011-split-comp-rewards/hypothetical_mainnet_upgrade.scen)\n- [Comptroller compSpeed bug disclosure](https://www.comp.xyz/t/comptroller-compspeed-bug/2111)\n- [Forums discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/rfp-16-dynamic-comp-reward-distribution/2016/11)\n- [Etherscan - contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x374abb8ce19a73f2c4efad642bda76c797f19233#code)",

      "content": "**Background**  \nThis proposal seeks to compensate users affected by the [unexpected increase](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dai-liquidation-event/642) in the DAI price to $1.30 on Coinbase Pro on November 26th, 2020. A total of 85,222,475 DAI was repaid on 11/26/20. Applying the 8% liquidation penalty, this proposal would pay out a total of 6,817,798 DAI from the 16.4 million DAI in the market [reserve](https://compound.finance/markets/DAI).\n\nThank you to the Compound community and investors for the weeks of feedback, iteration and discussions that have helped craft this proposal.\n\n**Code Mechanics**  \nThis proposal utilizes a slightly modified version of the  [merkle distributor](https://github.com/arr00/compound-compensation-proposal)  used for the airdrop of Uniswap’s UNI token. The merkle tree contains the [addresses of those affected](https://github.com/arr00/compound-compensation-proposal/blob/master/scripts/generateAddressBalances.js) by the liquidation event, and was reconciled and analyzed against on-chain data from around the time of the liquidation event (block bounds 11332733 to 11335286).\n\nA relayer will claim the merkle drop for each wallet according to the distributor and distribute the DAI to user’s wallets. Users do not need to interact with any contract to claim this DAI.\n\n[@arr00](https://www.comp.xyz/u/arr00)/[arr00](https://github.com/arr00/)  is the core contributor to the code.\n\n**Next steps:**  If you support this proposal, you can delegate COMP to this autonomous proposal.\n\nTo view the full forum post, [see here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/proposal-distribute-dai-to-users-affected-by-dai-liquidations/2110).\n",

      "content": "Originally from @getty\n\nSet Borrow cap to 4.6 Million\n\n\nProposal: remove the borrow cap on the cCOMP market.\n\nOn last Wednesday’s Community Call (I tried and failed to record the call…next time) we discussed removing the cCOMP borrow cap of 100k COMP. The borrow cap was originally put into place to prohibit someone from using the market to borrow COMP, create a governance proposal, vote, and return the capital in seconds. After the upgrade to Governor Bravo and the installation of a review period, the governance process is significantly more cost-prohibitive for a borrower to obtain the necessary votes to meet the proposal threshold. As well, the review period gives users 48-hours to position their COMP holding for a vote, unlike Governor Alpha which used an instantaneous voting system. If a malicious user were to borrow the required COMP to meet the proposal threshold the community would have sufficient time to defeat their proposal.\n\nRemoving the borrow cap will help the COMP market develop. Trading firms (onchain and offchain) utilize money markets like Compound and Aave in their systems to borrow assets and particularly ones that are not abundant in supply in traditional borrow/lend services like BlockFi, Genesis, Nexo, and Celsius. It is helpful for everyone if spot and futures markets are efficient.\n\nNext Steps: Changing the borrow cap does not require a traditional governance proposal since caps are controlled by the community multisig. The multisig holders follow the direction of the community. Below is a 7-day poll for removing the borrow cap on the cCOMP market. If you vote “YES” you think the borrow cap should be removed. If you vote “NO” you do not think the borrow cap should be removed. If the poll revolves to “YES” after the 7-day period the multisig holders will remove the borrow cap.",

This allows the closure of all outstanding borrows and the removal of reserves in deprecated markets including SAI, REP, and future migrations.\n\n### Development\n\nThis patch was developed publicly, coupled with completed scenario analysis. In addition to the Compound Labs bug bounty program, a secondary bug bounty was offered through [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/compound/).\n\n[Discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/safety-and-gas-patches/1723)\n",

      "title": "Oracle Improvement",
      "content": "## Introduction\n\nThis proposal will change the current oracle system from using Coinbase as the primary reporter of prices to Chainlink [Price Feeds](http://data.chain.link). Uniswap v2 is still used as an anchor (circuit breaker) and the anchor deviation window will change from 20% to 15%. As a precaution, the community multisig has the ability to engage a failover that will switch a market’s primary oracle from the current Price Feeds to Uniswap v2.\n\n### Proposal Call\n\nChange the Comptroller oracle from [0x4007B71e01424b2314c020fB0344b03A7C499E1A](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4007B71e01424b2314c020fB0344b03A7C499E1A) to [0x841616a5CBA946CF415Efe8a326A621A794D0f97](https://etherscan.io/address/0x841616a5CBA946CF415Efe8a326A621A794D0f97)\n\n### Oracle Update Details\n\nEach asset supported on the Compound market has a corresponding USD-paired price feed reference contract and a validatorProxy contract (which allows for the UniswapAnchorView (UAV) oracle contract to be updated by the community as new markets are added). When the reference contract of a Price Feed is updated by a decentralized network of oracle nodes with a new aggregated price value, the transmitter of that data also calls the validate() function on the market’s validatorProxy contract. When this function is called, the validatorProxy calls validate() on the UAV, which queries Uniswap v2 to check if the new price is within the Uniswap v2 TWAP anchor. If valid, the UAV is updated with the asset’s price. If invalid, the price data is not stored. Additional details on this process can be found in this comment [here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/oracle-infrastructure-chainlink-proposal/1272/55) on the Compound forum.\n\n[Here](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/compoundcommunity/original/1X/7033ce2e313f56c40441ba6dd9d900b0c2b244a7.png) is a visual example of how BAT/USD price feed is used, though this flow is the same for all asset markets.\n\nThe frequency of updates for each price feed depends on two triggers:\n\n* Deviation threshold - when the off-chain price of an asset is witnessed to have moved more than x% of the previously reported price, an on-chain update is initiated.\n\n* Heartbeat threshold - If x minutes have passed without an update, a new on-chain update is initiated.\n\nMore information can be found on [data.chain.link](http://data.chain.link/). Example: [ETH / USD](https://data.chain.link/eth-usd).\n\nPrice update events can be witnessed on the[ Etherscan events tab](https://etherscan.io/address/0x841616a5CBA946CF415Efe8a326A621A794D0f97#events).\n\nThe UniswapAnchorView token configuration has two additional fields: reporter & reporterMultiplier.\n\n* reporter: The address that submits prices for a particular cToken. This is always a ValidatorProxy contract that is always called by a price feed reference contract for each relevant price update posted by oracle nodes. In this case, 0xeBa6F33730B9751a8BA0b18d9C256093E82f6bC2 is the reporter of the price of BAT.\n\n* reporterMultiplier: Used to transform the price reported by the price feeds to the correct base unit that the UniswapAnchoredView expects. This is required because the price feeds report prices with different decimal placement than the UniswapAnchoredView.\n\nAudit report: Trail of Bits was commissioned for audit of the contracts.[ToB Audit report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TsOXhBLenStjdd2mxF1Sfmmh_Na9X527/view?usp=sharing)\n\nForum discussion and additional details: [Oracle Infrastructure: Chainlink Proposal](https://www.comp.xyz/t/oracle-infrastructure-chainlink-proposal/1272)\n\n#### Why\n\nIn late January I wrote on the [forum](https://www.comp.xyz/t/building-a-medianizer/1031) “Compound NEEDS to improve the current oracle infrastructure as a matter of safety and growth. I think it is evident to users that the current solution is not ideal and not close to ideal. The event that occurred in November with Dai liquidations was preventable….In addition to preventing the November event from transpiring again, I think it is also in the protocol’s best interest to improve the oracle situation so Compound can safely support more assets.”\n\nFive months, two forum threads, 114 forum replies, numerous calls, countless messages, and finally, we have a robust solution to improve the oracle system. This has been a long process, going over and re-reviewing many nuanced details with the community. Building in public is not always easy, but it was an insightful process and I am excited to see more assets on Compound. I look forward to continuing to improve the oracle system as the crypto landscape changes.",

TUSD is the only stablecoin that has [real-time, 24/7 attestations](https://real-time-attest.trustexplorer.io/trusttoken) from Armanino, a top US accounting firm, providing assurance that the token is fully collateralized by US Dollars. \n \n## Market Parameters \nThis proposal sets TUSD with a collateral factor of 0%, reserve factor of 7.5%, and unlimited borrow cap. These parameters follow the values set by USDT, with 0% collateral factor. The collateral factor can be proposed to be higher with a future proposal. \n \n This proposal updates the Compound price feed to peg TUSD to $1, similarly to USDC. By using a peg, weakness in the underlying asset will not change collateral requirements for users borrowing TUSD.\n \n[The interest rate model](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfb564da37b41b2f6b6edcc3e56fbf523bd9f2012) for TrueUSD relies on the same model as cUSDT and cDAI, JumpRateModelV2. \n \n## Contracts \ncTUSD is an upgradeable cToken contract that has been modified to accommodate potential transfer fees in the underlying token. \n \nThe cToken contract has been reviewed by OpenZeppelin and the Compound team.

This proposal transfers Compound governance to the new Governor Bravo contract.

The following two calls award COMP bounties to Arr00 and Blurr for organizing and executing the Governor Bravo project. The following call sets Governor Bravo as the pending admin, and the last call initiates Governor Bravo, accepting the Timelock admin.\n\n### Governor Bravo Details:\nGovernor Bravo has been developed by members of the community in the open for the past few months. The new contracts have been fully audited by Open Zeppelin, are fully covered by extensive test suites, have been simulated by forking simulations, and have been running on the kovan testnet. \n\nThe new features are as follows:\n- Upgradable implementation \n- Settable parameters (proposal threshold, voting period, voting delay)\n- Abstain vote option\n- Optional string voting reason\n- Proposer can always cancel their proposal (until execution)\n- Removal of the guardian\n- Continuous proposal id logic\n\n#### PS:\nTo celebrate the alphas who voted on Governor Alpha, we will be releasing a limited edition Compound NFT claimable by anyone who voted meaningfully on Governor Alpha prior to this proposal once Governor Bravo is initiated.\n\n#### References:\nDevelopment forum [post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/governor-bravo-development/942)\nProposal forum [post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/governor-bravo-proposal/1384)\n[Github PR](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/91)\n[Open Zeppelin Audit](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-governor-bravo-audit/)",

Standardizing the protocol to use the latest cTokens will reduce \"tech debt\" and allow us to roll out new features to all markets.\n\nWBTC was chosen as the first market to upgrade because of its recent proposal, which highlighted the need to be able to de-risk the market with new features (like supply caps, and protocol liquidation fees). After this migration, the community can proceed with upgrading BAT, ZRX, USDC, and finally ETH.\n\n### Upgrade Process\nA new WBTC cToken has been deployed, using the latest upgradable cToken contract and implementation. This proposal *supports* the new market, then *switches* the COMP Distribution from the prior market, to the new market. The market then inherits a 65% Collateral Factor, to match the legacy market.\n\nThe new WBTC cToken uses a modern interest rate model, that governance can update the parameters for. Initially, the parameters are set to an inflection point at 80% utilization, and a maximum interest rate of 40%, which resembles the legacy market.\n\nThe two WBTC markets will run in parallel, with users incentivized (but not required) to begin using the new contracts. When the legacy market is small enough, it can be deprectated like SAI and REP.\n\n### Contracts\n\nThe new cWBTC contract, and its implementation, rely on existing cToken contracts; no code was modified for this proposal, though new contracts were deployed, and peer reviewed.\n\nDiscussion: [comp.xyz](https://www.comp.xyz/t/legacy-market-migration-wbtc/1333)",

      "title": "Compound Grants Program",
      "content": "**Summary**\n\nWe propose to start a program called the Compound Grants Program (“CGP”), which will provide funding to projects, ideas, and events that benefit Compound and its stakeholders. If approved, funding for the program will come from Compound’s [treasury ](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x3d9819210a31b4961b30ef54be2aed79b9c9cd3b), which currently holds ~200k COMP (~$95mm as of 03/01/21). As a reminder, the treasury currently accrues 0.5 COMP per block, spends 0.352 COMP per block on liquidity incentives, and saves the balance of 0.148 COMP per block for governance by tokenholders.\n\nThe program will be a pilot. For this reason, we believe it’s prudent to limit the program’s dollar value to $1mm per quarter and the length to two quarters for a cost of $2mm (4,444 COMP) over six months.\n\nSince it’s not practical to solicit a community vote for every disbursement, we propose forming a small and nimble committee that has the power to administer the grants at its own discretion (limited by the aforementioned dollar and length caps). We suggest forming a committee of eight members: one lead member to head the program and seven reviewing members to review the lead’s work and assist with program operations. The committee will operate with a 4 of 7 multi-sig (only reviewers will be part of the multi-sig).\n\nAs compensation for administering the program, we propose the lead be paid $5k upfront and $100 per hour thereafter with a cap of 30 hours per week for a maximum compensation of $83k (184 COMP). In total, we are asking for a maximum of ~5,000 COMP to fund the grants (4,444 COMP), program setup and operational costs (444 COMP), and compensation for the program lead (184 COMP). All unspent funds will be returned to the community treasury at the conclusion of the CGP.\n\n**Purpose**\n\nDecentralized projects are living and breathing communities with a variety of stakeholders. These stakeholders include project team/contributors, tokenholders, users, partners, and for certain projects, liquidity providers. The goal for the CGP is to nurture Compound’s ecosystem to benefit all of these stakeholders. To be more specific, the grants program aims to:\n\n* Grow Compound’s ecosystem by funding development happening on top of it. Funding development focused on helping Compound grow is critical to the project’s long-term success.\n* Fund ideas that benefit Compound that would otherwise not receive funding. Many good ideas are left unexplored because they fail to receive funding. We intend to make sure as few good ideas as possible are underfunded or unfunded.\n* Strengthen goodwill by providing funding for community-led ideas. Funding projects, ideas, and events brought forth by community members will encourage more active participation by the community. It will have the added benefit of nourishing goodwill. A well-nourished goodwill keeps community members loyal and happy, which in turn, encourages new members to join what they see is a thriving community.\n\n**Program Scope**\n\nThe CGP was heavily inspired by the [Uniswap Grants Program ](https://gov.uniswap.org/t/rfc-uniswap-grants-program-v0-1/9081) (“UGP”), which received approval from the community to deploy a maximum of $750k per quarter for two quarters. It’s difficult to deploy a meaningful amount of money to ecosystem grants without compromising on quality. While we believe all of these ecosystems will be enormous in the future, it’s important for us to be practical today by matching the grants budget to the size of the ecosystem.\n\nTo that end, the pilot program will deploy a maximum of $1mm per quarter and run for two quarters. We have no way of knowing whether this amount of money is overshooting or undershooting the needs of the ecosystem — we will only find out *after* running the experiment. For example, if we find out $2mm is not enough money to fund all of the high quality opportunities, we as a community may decide we need to create a larger allocation for grants. On the flipside, if we find out $2mm is too much, all unspent funds will be returned to the community treasury for use at a later time.\n\nAs part of the program, our intention is to fund projects, ideas, and events that *directly* benefit Compound and its stakeholders. While there may be opportunities to fund projects, ideas, and events that *indirectly* benefit Compound, these opportunities fall outside the scope of this program.\n\nNot all opportunities applying for grants will benefit the Compound ecosystem equally. To help us prioritize which ideas to fund, we propose the following buckets:\n\n*High priority*\n\n* Protocol and parameter development. Apart from acts of stewardship and generosity, there is little to no incentive for community members to propose technical updates to the protocol. With no carrot with which to motivate community members to propose changes, the protocol isn’t able to innovate as quickly as it should be innovating in a dynamic and competitive market. We should note that in a minority of cases community members did receive payment for work done (for example, see the work done by Gauntlet on the [COMP Contributor Grants ](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/30) proposal), although here too, the incentive to contribute was not well-designed since it required Gauntlet to front audit and development costs before knowing the proposal to pay them would pass. To encourage community members to propose changes, the CGP will fully or partially pre-fund development and audit costs. In doing so, we hope to encourage more proposals, which will lead to more innovation and as a result, a far better Compound for all of us.\n* Code audits. Making technical updates to the protocol is risky business: smart contracts are immutable and control billions of dollars in user funds. An error in a technical update can have serious consequences. Because of this, it is considered best practice to have an auditor review the proposed update for soundness prior to its submission. Unfortunately, these audits are [expensive ](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-contributor-grants/756/6), particularly for individual contributors who need to pay for them out of pocket. We intend to provide grants that pre-fund audit costs for soon-to-be proposals. We hope this will encourage more individual contributors to propose technical updates to the protocol.\n* Business development / integrations. A greater amount of liquidity makes Compound a better product for all users. To grow liquidity, Compound should be integrated with as many applications as possible. To that end, we aim to fund integrations that grow usage of Compound. In funding integrations, we will effectively be funding the business development function for the protocol.\n* Advertising and sponsorships. It will be important to get the word out there about this program. The more people there are that know about the CGP, the more applications we should expect to receive. To spread the word about the program, we will spend funds to advertise the CGP on podcasts, newsletters, and other mediums that attract the audience we want to attract.\n\n*Medium priority*\n\n* Hackathons. It’s very likely that there exist uses for Compound that haven’t been explored yet. Hackathons are a fantastic way to explore design spaces, and the CGP intends to sponsor them.\n* Bounties. This one speaks for itself: bug fixes and minor protocol updates will be covered by the CGP.\n\n*Low priority*\n\n* Miscellaneous improvements. It’s difficult to know ahead of time all of the grant applications that will come through. Just because an application does not fit neatly into one of the above buckets doesn’t mean it’s not valuable to the Compound ecosystem. So long as an application benefits Compound directly, we will consider it for a grant.\n* Applications for miscellaneous improvements to Compound fall into this bucket. Because the scope of this bucket is broad, we consider it to be low priority compared to the narrowly scoped buckets above.\n\nWhile we did our best to prioritize items among each of the three buckets, we are confident that the above list is not all-inclusive. We expect to receive grant applications for phenomenal ideas that we simply can’t think of today. The committee asks the community for the right to exercise discretion to fund ideas that are beneficial to Compound but are not part of the scope outlined above.\n\n**Process and Timeline**\n\nIf approved, the program will begin shortly after this proposal passes and end six months following the start of the program. (In other words, if the proposal passes on 3/15/2021 and begins on 3/22/2021, it will end on 9/22/2021). The program will run on a rolling process: we will welcome applications at any point in time during the program length! We will stop accepting applications two weeks before the end of the program (during these two weeks, we will start wrapping the program up, which will include evaluating the last of the applications and returning unspent funds to the treasury).\n\nWe will source potential grants via an applications process. (We will be sharing the application soon after this proposal passes).\n\nOnce an application is received, CGP committee members will discuss the application and evaluate it in the context of its benefit to Compound and its stakeholders. If the committee approves the application, funds will be paid out to the receiving party on the timely basis. If the committee does not approve the application, the soliciting party will be notified as to why the application was not approved and, if applicable, what steps need to be taken to have the application approved in the future. All approved grants and their amounts will be disclosed to the community publicly and on a timely basis.\n\nFinally, a member of the CGP committee will participate in the bi-weekly Compound community developer calls. We will attend the call, listen to what the community thinks should be funded, and present some of the newly funded grants.\n\n**Committee Members**\n\nThe CGP committee will consist of eight members: one lead and seven reviewers. We believe the best committees share two features: first they must be capable, and second they must be motivated to actively participate. We believe this committee shares these two vital features.\n\n*Lead*\n\n[Larry Sukernik ](https://twitter.com/lsukernik) (Sheepshead Bay, LLC)\n\n*Reviewer*\n\n[Getty Hill ](https://twitter.com/getty_hill) (Grapefruit Trading)\n\n*Reviewer*\n\n[Aparna Krishnan ](https://twitter.com/aparnalocked) (Opyn)\n\n*Reviewer*\n\n[Monetsupply ](https://twitter.com/monetsupply) (Independent)\n\n*Reviewer*\n\n[Min Teo ](https://twitter.com/_minteo) (ConsenSys)\n\n*Reviewer*\n\n[Leighton Cusack](https://twitter.com/lay2000lbs) (PoolTogether)\n\n*Reviewer*\n\n[Jesse Walden ](https://twitter.com/jessewldn) (Variant)\n\n*Reviewer*\n\n[Nick Cannon](https://twitter.com/inkymaze) (Gauntlet)\n\nThe lead will be tasked with managing and operating the program while reviewers will have a duty of holding the lead accountable. To guarantee accountability, the committee will operate with a 4 of 7 multi-sig managed by the reviewers (note that the lead is not part of the multi-sig). In other words, four out of seven reviewers will need to sign the transaction for a grant to be approved and disbursed.\n\n**Committee Compensation**\n\nWe propose the lead be paid $5k upfront and $100 per hour thereafter with a cap of 30 hours per week for a maximum compensation of $83k (~184 COMP). Since the majority of the work will be performed by the lead, they will be the only committee member to receive payment as part of the program pilot. Payments to the lead will be approved by the reviewers and made according to the following schedule: $5k upfront, with the balance paid at the end of each quarter (i.e., if the program begins on 3/22/21, the lead will be paid $5k on 3/22/21, and the again on 6/22/21 and 9/22/21 based on hours worked).\n\nThe funds for both the program and the lead’s pay will be allocated to the CGP multi-sig from the Compound treasury. Running the CGP will come with setup and operational costs; we will set aside approximately 10% of the CGP budget to cover these costs. All unspent funds will be returned to the community treasury at the conclusion of the CGP.\n\n**What Does Success Look Like?**\n\nWe expect success to come in two forms: one that’s measurable and the other that’s of the “you know it when you see it” type.\n\nMeasurable success metrics:\n\n* Number of projects, ideas, and events funded\n* Community engagement (e.g., increased activity on forums, Discord, and so forth)\n* Increase in number of applications\n\n“Know it when you see it” success metrics:\n\n* Improved sentiment and goodwill within the community\n* Improvement to Compound’s brand and positioning in the market\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIf approved, the CGP will begin accepting applications for grants on a rolling basis shortly after its approval. To assist with the evaluation of potential grants, each grant will be classified into three buckets: high, medium, and low. High priority grants will be funded first; medium priority grants will be funded second; low priority grants will be funded last.\n\nThis program is a pilot. As such, we intend to keep the budget lean for a maximum disbursement of 5,000 COMP over six months across grants, setup and operational costs, and lead compensation. Make no mistake: this is an experiment. If the CGP works, Compound may want to graduate the program from a pilot to a full-time endeavor. If it doesn’t work, we will learn why it didn’t work and what should be done differently. Most of us are COMP holders here. That gives the privilege to try something that’s never been tried before at a meaningful scale: to let the test subjects run the experiments.",

Currently, WBTC risk is 8 times worse than it was 2 weeks ago and now accounts for 99% of the risk in the protocol across all assets. We are moving to lower the collateral factor for WBTC from 75% to 65%. This will reduce (but not remove) the aforementioned risk, and we will re-evaluate if the proposal passes before proposing to lower it further to 0.6%. If liquidity and volatility for WBTC improve, we will be sure to take that into account. \n\nWe are also changing the collateral factors for both ZRX and BAT, raising those slightly to improve capital efficiency for borrowers. We realize that bundling these changes might make the decision more complex for voters. However, these additional changes are small and were largely unopposed in [the last proposal](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/38) that merely failed to reach quorum amidst high gas prices.",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nAs [Robert Leshner mentioned in his forum post]([https://compound.finance/governance](https://compound.finance/governance)), the community now has the power to control COMP distribution across markets after [Gauntlet's recent proposal (#33)](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/33). This will allow the protocol to better and more efficiently manage how COMP is used to improve and further the protocol's interests. Given that the initial COMP distribution numbers were set somewhat arbitrarily, it has become clear that it is worth resetting the parameters based on usage over the last six months. The refreshed numbers proposed will be used for A/B testing optimal COMP emission quantities in future proposals.\n\nIn a [comp.xyz forum post]([https://www.comp.xyz/t/comp-distribution-speeds/899/11](https://www.comp.xyz/t/comp-distribution-speeds/899/11)), Robert and Sirokko have put forth reasonable suggestions that we believe would improve upon the existing values. Both of their values for COMP distribution were quite similar and we chose Sirokko's numbers for two reasons:\n1. All markets are given a fixed quantity (10% of rewards spread evenly across the 9 active markets) of COMP rewards\n2. Splitting each market's COMP rewards into a fixed quantity (common to all markets) and a variable quantity makes it easy to analyze improvements in future A/B tests for incentives\n\nPlease read the forum post for more details.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n- Robert Leshner: For starting the discussion and putting out the first distribution numbers\n- Sirokko: For providing a coherent methodology for this refresh\n- Hsien-Tang Kao: For analyzing 1-step recursive borrowing in existing markets\n\n## References\n- [Forum post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/comp-distribution-speeds/899/21)",

      "content": "When the DSR (Dai Savings Rate) was introduced by MakerDAO, the Compound team developed a [CDaiDelegate](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/CDaiDelegate.sol) to take advantage of DSR (pre governance). With DSR remaining at 0% for an extended period of time, it would be advantageous for the sake of gas fees to change back to an implementation which doesn’t deposit to DSR.\n\nI propose setting the cDai implementation to the [CErc20Delegate](https://etherscan.io/address/0x976aa93ca5aaa569109f4267589c619a097f001d#code) which is already the implementation for cUSDT and setting the interest rate model for cDai to [that of cUSDT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFB564da37B41b2F6B6EDcc3e56FbF523bD9F2012#code). The interest rate model change is necessary because the current IRM takes DSR into account. The actual interest parameters (base rate, multiplier, jump multiplier, and kink) will remain the same.\n\nThe end result of this proposal will be gas savings for users. This proposal has been simulated on a network fork to ensure expected outcome and uses contracts which have already been part of the Compound ecosystem for a long time.

Currently, there is not enough space in the `Comptroller` for vesting changes, which is the main impetus for this proposal. We split this out from the remainder of the vesting changes, as these changes provide protocol users with some more immediate gas benefits. An itemized summary of the changes is as follows:\n1. This proposal removes automatic COMP claims for users and also removes automatic COMP speed refresh, replacing it with `_setCompSpeed` , controlled by governance\n2. Implements several related small changes related to the above to further optimize the Comptroller contract and reduce gas costs for users.\nPlease note that this patch is **not** in itself making any immediate COMP speed adjustment, it is simply removing some redundant speed change functions and giving governance more direct control.\n\n## References\n- [Audit, by QuantStamp](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/compound-protocol) (please note that some of the code has changed since the audit, see PR for more details) \n- [Pull Request on GitHub](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/83)\n- [Forum post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/comptroller-optimizations-to-enable-vesting/845)",

      "title": "Distribute COMP to Affected Users in the DAI Liquidations",
      "content": "**Background:**\n\nCOMP distribution to users began on June 15, 2020, and has since distributed ~450K COMP, with approximately 4MM COMP remaining.\n\nBehind the scenes, the distribution works through two main contracts, the [Reservoir](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2775b1c75658be0f640272ccb8c72ac986009e38), and the [Comptroller](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d9819210a31b4961b30ef54be2aed79b9c9cd3b). The `Reservoir` is an immutable contract that exists outside the control of governance and drips 0.50 COMP per block into the `Comptroller` contract. The Reservoir continuously adds COMP at the drip rate and is independent of the rate at which the Comptroller distributes such COMP. The Comptroller contract controls the usage and distribution rate of COMP for a number of functions including but not limited to, i) distribution to borrowers and lenders for each market, ii) [building a reserve](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/21) that can be used for community needs, and iii) voting, among other uses.\n\nCurrently, the Comptroller distributes 0.352 COMP/block (70%) on liquidity incentives and accrues the remaining 0.148 COMP/block (30%) as treasury reserves. At the current COMP price of $155, Compound's treasury is growing at a rate of ~$149,000 per day, or $4.5MM per month.\n\n[Gauntlet's prop30](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/30) added the [ability](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-contributor-grants/756) for the Comptroller contract to send COMP to a particular user, group, address, or contract selected by a governance vote. These changes as [described by jmo](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-contributor-grants/756), enable a plethora of use cases, including the use of treasury assets to compensate those liquidated in the Thanksgiving Event, as [suggested by mrhen](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dai-liquidation-compensation/684/10).\n\n**Mechanics:**\n\nThis proposal uses the `_grantComp` function introduced by Gauntlet to distribute a set quantity of COMP to a [Merkle distributor contract](https://github.com/kybx86/compound/blob/master/compensation_prop/merkle-root/compCompensationMerkleTree.json) that will automatically distribute the corresponding COMP to each of the [wallets](https://github.com/kybx86/compound/blob/master/compensation_prop/generateAddressBalances/addressBalancesDecimal.json) affected—user's don't need to interact with any contract to claim this COMP; After the proposal's execution, the relayer will claim COMP for each wallet according to the Merkle distributor and distribute it.\n\nTo calculate the amount of COMP needed from the Comptroller for the compensation, this proposal uses the 14-day average closing price of COMP from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/compound/historical-data/) as of the time of writing (12/8/20) to compensate users 8% of the liquidated amount.\n\nAs an illustrative example, if a wallet had 100 DAI repaid by a liquidator, then that wallet would receive 8 DAI worth of COMP, which equates to 0.064 COMP of compensation (using a 14-day average COMP price of $123.39).\n\n**Distributor Methodology**\n\nReferencing the DAI liquidations [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ozVGA7mwn-xFQb1oAKsNczMRL-Dj9JgG_0UXH2IQ1s8/edit#gid=0) published by [rleshner](https://twitter.com/rleshner), a total of 85,220,406.43 DAI was repaid on 11/26/20. Applying the 8% liquidation penalty, this proposal would pay out a total of 6,817,632.51 DAI (in COMP). Taking the 6,817,632.51 DAI and dividing by $123.39 (the 14-day average price of COMP) equals 55,254.95 COMP distributed to users.\n\n- To view the detailed math breakdown, [see here](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/compoundcommunity/original/1X/6385f4950b0adcf89edc3178f7248c181908fb71.png).\n- To preview the COMP distribution per address, [see here](https://github.com/kybx86/compound/blob/master/compensation_prop/generateAddressBalances/addressBalancesDecimal.json).\n\nOverall, this distribution of COMP represents only 0.55% of the fully diluted COMP 10M supply and less than 2% of the 24hr COMP volume traded globally, suggesting minimal market impact. Additionally, assuming the Comptroller earns 962 COMP per day, the 55k COMP distribution will be replenished in less than 60 days.\n\n**Next steps:**\nIf you support this proposal, you can delegate COMP to this autonomous proposal.\n\n**Disclosure:**\nFor full transparency, I was one of the 121 Compound users affected in the DAI liquidation event. I recently worked with the community to pass a [reserve factor change](https://www.comp.xyz/t/increase-dai-reserve-factor-from-5-to-15/765/3) to the DAI market to de-risk it and prevent repeat events.\n\n**Resources:**\nTo view the full forum post, [see here](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compensation-proposal/801).",

This proposal adds the ability for the Compound protocol to send this COMP to a particular user or group, selected by a governance vote. The functionality has two components:\n1. `_grantComp`: An ability for Governance to pay a particular amount of COMP to a specific address\n2. `_setContributorCompSpeed`: An ability for Goverance to _stream_ a grant to a participant.\nAn in-depth description of the changes can be found in [this forum post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-contributor-grants/756) and the linked documents. We're looking forward to continuing the conversation on the forums.\nBesides adding this functionality, we also:\n1. Remove code from the Comptroller to reduce its size (making room for the changes mentioned above)\n2. Award ourselves a COMP grant (1000 COMP) to offset development and audit costs.\n\n## References\n* [comp.xyz Forum post](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-contributor-grants/756)\n* [Audit, by Quantstamp](https://certificate.quantstamp.com/full/compound-protocol)\n* [Development Specification](https://www.notion.so/PUBLIC-Compound-vesting-specification-b52d1c6b3bc24f53b693ebe88d0c836f)\n* [Pull request on Github](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/79)",

However, as a new market, it is being introduced with conservative parameters; a *Collateral Factor* equal to ZRX and BAT (which are both less liquid, smaller market cap tokens), a lower *Reserve Factor* of 20%, and a *Borrowing Cap* of 2,000,000 UNI.\n\nThe UNI market uses the same interest rate model as USDT, with an upper bound of 30% APY at 100% utilization.\n\n## Contracts\ncUNI is an upgradable cToken contract that has been modified with a single new function; the ability to *Delegate* the UNI held inside the contract to an address specified by Governance. This will allow Compound Governance to participate in Uniswap Governance. Initially, UNI will be undelegated.\n\nThe cUNI contract has been peer-reviewed by Compound Labs and community developers, but given the limited scope of the modifications, has not been audited by third-party professional auditors.\n\nA new Open Price Feed view contract has been deployed, which adds support for cUNI. No changes were otherwise made to the view contract.\n\nThe contracts were [developed in the open](https://www.comp.xyz/t/adding-new-markets-to-compound/392), and can serve as a template for the community to launch additional markets.\n",

In addition to having a much larger supply today, WBTC liquidity has significantly grown since proposal 16 was passed. Uniswap.info shows WBTC on July 14th with a total liquidity of ~$1.15M while today it has ~$230M.\n\nWith this starkly increased liquidity and demand, it makes sense to increase the WBTC collateral factor. Even with this proposed increase to 60%, the WBTC collateral factor would still be significantly under that of DAI, USDC, and ETH, which are each 75%.\n\nWe agree with the arguments from proposal 16 that this change would help diversify the set of assets available to borrow on Compound.

      "content": "##### Summary\nRecently, Dharma built, tested, and deployed a new upgradable interest rate model contract for cDAI based on the new JumpRateModelV2. Shortly thereafter, Arr00 proposed an update to the cUSDT interest rate model that followed the new cDAI architecture. \n\nThis proposal updates the cUSDC interest rate model to a recently deployed LegacyJumpRateModelV2 with the same parameters as the current cDAI and cUSDT interest rate models:\n- 0% base rate (current 2%)\n- 4% borrow rate at kink (current no kink)\n- Kink at 80% utilization (current no kink)\n- 25% borrow rate at 100% utilization (current 12.25%)\n- Owner is Timelock (0x6d903f6003cca6255D85CcA4D3B5E5146dC33925)\n\nThis proposal completes the effort of setting a standardized interest rate model for all stablecoins on Compound.\n\nThe new LegacyJumpRateModelV2 is a simple refactorization of existing code and has been tested using fork simulations. The code has *not* been audited professionally due to the simplicity of the changes made.\n\nThis contract was written, tested, and deployed by Arr00 and reviewed by Dharma. The proposal comes from Dharma as Arr00 does not (yet!) have sufficient COMP delegation.\n\nThe last two actions take 622 Sai (currently valued at $1200) from reserves and transfer them to Arr00 as a bounty for his work on this proposal.\n\n##### Graph of proposed Interest Rate Model\n![IRM Graph](https://i.imgur.com/ehc2LLY.png)\nNew [LegacyJumpRateModelV2](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd8ec56013ea119e7181d231e5048f90fbbe753c0#code)\nGitHub [PR](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/61)\n[Discussion](https://www.comp.xyz/t/update-cusdc-interest-rate-model/317)",

      "content": "As COMP has grown into one of the more robustly traded and earned DeFi assets, it is time to assess emission rate. [Analysis by Gauntlet](https://www.comp.xyz/t/compound-proposal-022-systematically-reduce-emission-quantity/241) suggests that the current emission rate of 0.44 COMP / block is too high. Our aim in reducing emissions is two-fold. Firstly, we want to ensure that the protocol builds up a reserve of COMP that can be used for paying for other community needs. These needs include (but are not limited to) further security audits, funding feature development, incentivizing voters for participating, and liquidity incentivization. Secondly, we believe that the current emissions are too high to simply provide liquidity. Our analysis, combined with data from Nansen (below), illustrates that the majority of COMP goes to short-term holders and centralized exchanges.\n\n![Nansen Exchange Data](https://i.imgur.com/fv0Cq88.png)\n\nWe and others believe that COMP should be used for furthering protocol development and onboarding new users to the protocol. By first lowering the emissions rate and subsequently adding COMP emission vesting, we believe that COMP can be utilized to achieve these goals.",

      "content": "This proposal changes the price oracle in Compound to use the Open Price Feed deployed at [0x9b8eb8b3d6e2e0db36f41455185fef7049a35cae](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9b8eb8b3d6e2e0db36f41455185fef7049a35cae). The Open Price Feed is an [open-source project](https://github.com/compound-finance/open-oracle) where a set of reporters sign price data which is posted on-chain for use by DeFi protocols. There is no privilege required to post prices, and we encourage the community to build additional posters to keep prices up-to-date. The Compound Protocol will initially use price data from Coinbase (via the [Coinbase Oracle](https://blog.coinbase.com/introducing-the-coinbase-price-oracle-6d1ee22c7068)) as well as a time-weighted average price from Uniswap's on-chain markets to ensure price integrity.\n\nThe Open Price Feed has been audited by Open Zeppelin [1](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-open-price-feed-uniswap-integration-audit/) [2](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-open-oracle-audit/). The system initially supports prices for BAT, WBTC, COMP, DAI, ETH, KNC, LINK, REP, SAI, USDC, USDT and ZRX. The system is compatible with support for more tokens and different reporters, both of which would require a new Governance proposal.\n\nThe Open Price Feed system was [announced almost a year ago](https://medium.com/compound-finance/announcing-compound-open-oracle-development-cff36f06aad3). We envisioned the system as an easy way for different projects and exchanges to sign data without the burden of posting that data onto the Ethereum blockchain itself. Instead, the exchanges expose an HTTP endpoint with an Ethereum-signed message containing the price data. The goal is that every exchange can provide such data, which can be used by every DeFi project.\n\nIn the current incarnation of the Open Price Feed, it takes the prices from Coinbase's Oracle (which was designed in coordination with the Open Price Feed) and it tests that price against a time-weighted average price (TWAP) from Uniswap v2. If the price for a given asset from Coinbase is within 20% of the Uniswap TWAP for that asset, it is posted and immediately is available for use in the Protocol (e.g. for collateral calculations). The TWAP calculation is based on the [Uniswap Oracle](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/core-concepts/oracles/) concept.\n\nThe Open Price Feed has been running in production for several weeks and has been tested on the Ropsten and Kovan test-nets.

      "content": "## Summary\nOver the past several weeks, Dharma (in collaboration with arr00) has written and tested a new version of JumpRateModel and integrated it into an updated interest rate model for cDAI. This updated interest rate model allows for the following parameters to be updated by governance proposal (ie. no-code updates):\n\n1.  Interest Rate at 0% Utilization\n2. Interest Rate at 100% Utilization\n3. The Utilization % at which the model “kinks”\n4. Interest Rate at the “kink”\n\nWe believe this model can form the basis for the interest rate models of other cAssets, including cUSDC and cUSDT, which we believe should have models of a similar nature. We encourage other community members to adapt this code to do so, and will enthusiastically support proposals to update the interest rate models of other cAssets to models of this format.\n\nThis proposal was [discussed in the governance forum]([https://www.comp.xyz/t/dharma-to-submit-update-to-cdai-interest-rate-model/91](https://www.comp.xyz/t/dharma-to-submit-update-to-cdai-interest-rate-model/91)) prior to submission.\n\n## Specifics\n-  New cDAI Interest Rate Model: [Deployed Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfed941d39905b23d6faf02c8301d40bd4834e27f#code)\n- New cDAI Interest Rate Model: [Github Link to PR](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/35)\n- Interest Rate Model Parameter Changes:\n  - Change APY at 100% utilization:\n    - Current: 15%\n    -  New: 25%\n  - Change the Utilization Rate that defines the “kink”:\n    - Current: 90%\n    - New: 80%\n  - Change APY at “kink”:\n    - Current: 2%\n    - New: 4%\n  - No change to Base Rate per Block *(APY at 0% utilization)*:\n    - Current: 0%\n    - New: 0%\n\n*Note: all rates are still “on top of” the DAI interest rate parameters set by MakerDAO governance.*\n\n## Image of Proposed cDAI Interest Rate Model\n![https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/compoundcommunity/original/1X/51ac6b49e0aa2af572d633c4302e3a8586de6fba.png](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard17/uploads/compoundcommunity/original/1X/51ac6b49e0aa2af572d633c4302e3a8586de6fba.png)",

      "title": "Update cDAI Interest Rate Model",
      "content": "## Summary\nEight days ago, we [proposed decoupling the cDAI interest rate model from MCD parameters](https://compound.comradery.io/post/1758). While we received positive feedback regarding the updating of cDAI interest rate model, the community also clearly indicated a reticence to decouple from MCD at this time. As a result, we are proposing an updated cDAI interest rate model, but this model does not decouple from MCD. We intend to continue to iterate on the model over the coming months.\n\n\n## Updated Model\n- [Deployed contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdf44fd0dc991c41ba87812441f98902df2df5786#code)\n- [Pull request](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/31)\n\n\n## Interest Rate Model Updates\nWe are proposing the following changes to the cDAI interest rate model:\n\n**1. Change APY at 100% util**\n- Current: 15%\n- New: 25%\n\n\n**2. Change the Utilization Rate that defines the \"kink\"**\n- Current: 90%\n- New: 80%\n\n\n**3. Change `gapPerBlock`, the parameter that determines the \"slope\" prior to the kink**\n- Current: 2%\n- New: 4% *(**note:** with current SF / DSR,  this gives an APY of 4.34% at the kink)*\n\n\n**4. No change to Base Rate per Block (APR at 0% utilization)**\n- Current: 0%\n- New: 0%\n\n\n## Rationale for the Changes\n**Change 1: Increase APY at 100% Utilization**\n\nWhen a Compound asset is 100% utilized, suppliers are unable to withdraw their capital, and new borrowers cannot take on loans. This is extremely suboptimal, and should be reflected by handsome compensation to suppliers. In our view, 15% APY is not sufficiently high to achieve rapid asset re-allocation in a 100% utilization scenario, nor does it accurately reflect the lockup that suppliers experience. As such, we propose raising this parameter to 25% APY.\n\n\n**Change 2: Change the Utilization Rate that Defines the \"Kink\"**\n\nThe \"kink\" in the cDAI interest rate model reflects the utilization rate at which the slope of the interest rate goes from \"gradual\" to \"steep\". That is, below this utilization rate, the slope of the interest rate curve is gradual. Above this utilization rate, it is steep.\n\n\nBecause of this dynamic between the interest rate curves before and after the \"kink\", the \"kink\" can be thought of as the target utilization rate. Above that rate, it quickly becomes expensive to borrow (and commensurately lucrative for suppliers).\n\n\nIn our view, 90% Utilization should not be the target utilization. This would mean that the protocol aims to only allow 10% of capital suppliers to exit the system at any given time. In our opinion, this is insufficient. We suggest that a greater portion of the capital suppliers should be able to exit at any time, and as such propose lowering the utilization rate that defines the \"kink\" to 80%.\n\n\n**Change 3: Change APY at \"Kink\"**\n\nAs we said in Change 3, the \"kink\" defines the target utilization of the market. Thus, the interest rate at the kink is the target interest rate. And in our view, 2% APY is too low to be the current \"target interest rate\". We approach the question of \"what is the right target interest rate?\" with humility. We honestly don't know. As such, we decided to approach searching for the ideal rate by doubling it, and then adjusting based on further market indications. We hope to see market indications that suggest that the curve is \"in range\". Should these indications materialize, changes to the parameter can become more incremental.\n\n\n**No Change to Base Rate per Block**\n\nIn our view, it is appropriate to set the interest rate at 0% when there is no utilization of the asset. At zero utilization, the market is indicating that borrowing that asset is not attractive. Increasing the interest rate would only exacerbate the unattractiveness of borrowing the asset. As such, we left this parameter unchanged.",

Each market is allocated COMP relative to borrowing demand; the allocation is then split equally between suppliers and borrowers.\n\nThe function has also been updated to require an external account (not a smart contract), reducing the risk of griefing.\n\nThis patch has been [discussed](https://compound.comradery.io/post/1769) and [developed in the open](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/29), reviewed by members of the community, and tested on Ethereum’s Kovan and Ropsten testnets.

      "title": "Set reserve factor for cUSDT to 20.0%",
      "content": "In a [recent proposal](https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/8), blck proposes raising the Reserve Factor on USDT from 0% to 10%. We support blck's proposal because we agree that the Reserve Factor needs to increase. But we do not think Proposal 8 goes far enough. We propose raising the Reserve Factor to 20% (from either 0% if blck's proposal fails, or 10% if it succeeds).\n\n**Background on Reserve Factor**\n\nThe Reserve Factor in Compound is the parameter that controls how much of the interest for a given asset is routed to that asset's Reserve Pool. The Reserve Pool protects lenders against borrower default and liquidation malfunction. For example, a 5% Reserve Factor means that 5% of the interest that borrowers pay for that asset would be routed to the Reserve Pool instead of to lenders.\n\n\nThus, as a market grows, it is important that the Reserve Pool grow commensurately in order to adequately protect lenders.\n\n**Why 10% is too low for USDT's Reserve Factor**\n\nWe believe there are two reasons for raising the Reserve Factor to 20% (vs. 10%).\n\n\nAs has been discussed at length in the Compound Discord's [#governance channel](https://discord.com/channels/402910780124561410/682253201701208169), the USDT market is being manipulated by COMP token harvesters, taking advantage of the interest rate model of USDT to generate COMP for themselves. A 20% Reserve Factor will remove 20% of the incentive, reducing the \"earned interest\" for lenders and thus their incentive to game the system.\n\n\nIn the long-run, it's likely that 20% is too high to be sustainable. But we believe that it will rapidly address the incentive gaming currently taking place, and if 20% does end up being too draconian, we will address that by reducing the Reserve Factor in the future.",

      "title": "Update DAI Interest Rate Model to Better Accommodate Zero Stability Fee",
      "content": "## Proposal Summary\nIn this Compound Improvement Proposal, we propose a new interest rate model for Dai. We believe this new interest rate model provides a better user experience to capital suppliers, with minimal impact to borrowers.\n\n## Context\nWhen the DAI interest rate model was developed and deployed, the community, including the Compound team, did not anticipate the Stability Fee (SF) and Dai Savings Rate (DSR) in MakerDAO's Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD) system to be set to zero for a prolonged period of time. As a result, the current Dai interest rate model in Compound does not provide a good user experience to capital suppliers when the SF and/or DSR are zero. \n\n## Chart of Current Interest Rate Model\nThis is a chart of the current Dai interest rate model when the Dai Savings Rate is set to zero:\n\n![https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37939117/80403543-bebc5000-888d-11ea-8e21-3d957f7282eb.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37939117/80403543-bebc5000-888d-11ea-8e21-3d957f7282eb.png)\n\nAs you can see, when capital utilization is below 90%, suppliers earn practically nothing. And when capital utilization is greater than 90%, rates fluctuate wildly due to the steep slope of the post-kink part of the curve.\n\n## Proposed Interest Rate Model\nOur proposal adjusts the current model to provide a modest interest rate to capital suppliers when interest rates are below 90%. As an added benefit, when rates are greater than 90%, the interest rate volatility should decrease (slightly).\n\n![https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37939117/80403556-c54ac780-888d-11ea-89f7-5ac073a7ac39.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37939117/80403556-c54ac780-888d-11ea-89f7-5ac073a7ac39.png)\n\n# Supporting Links\n- [Deployed `DAIInterestRateV2` contract utilized in this proposal]( https://etherscan.io/address/0x000000007675b5e1da008f037a0800b309e0c493#code)\n- [PR containing this proposal merged into `compound-finance/compound-protocol` Github repo](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/pull/23)",

By using a peg, weakness in the underlying asset won’t change collateral requirements for users borrowing Tether.\n\nThe initial [interest rate model](https://etherscan.io/address/0x6bc8fe27d0c7207733656595e73c0d5cf7afae36) for Tether is a jump-rate model which ranges from 2% at 0% utilization, to 20% at 90% utilization, then jumps to 40% at 100% utilization.\n\ncUSDT is an upgradable cToken contract that has been modified to accommodate potential transfer fees in the underlying token.
