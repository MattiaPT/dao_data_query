      "content": "With the success of our \"YGG Discord Proposal Review\" which had 514 yes and 14 no votes. We now move to the second step a \"YGG Snapshot Governance Vote\" is the formal governance process where YGG token holders will be able to vote to approve or reject the proposal.\n\nAll YGG token holders are invited to contribute their vote to the review process to help guide the future of the guild.\n\nThe YGG Splinterlands player community is proposing forming the YGG Splinterlands SubDAO (YGGSPL) so that active SubDAO members can take part in the management of existing YGG Splinterlands assets with the goal of maximising yield.\n\nPlease see the proposed YGGSPL Whitepaper here attached below.\n\nhttps://info.yieldguild.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/YGGSPL_SubDAO_V2.pdf\n\nA majority (51% or more) of “yes” votes will be required for the proposal to pass and the creation of YGGSPL subDAO to commence.\n\nVoting will be open Nov 9, 2021 1pm UTC -4 until deadline Nov 16, 2021 1pm UTC -4.\n",
