      "content": "### TLDR\n\nThere has been overwhelming demand from the Purple Membership to move our contracts from Mainnet to an L2. High Mainnet costs are an impediment to voting and ultimately engagement. BuilderDAO has released their latest contacts, Bali, which can be used to migrate DAO's using builder protocol on Mainnet to a Superchain L2 (OP, Base, Zora). Several polls conducted in /purple showed a strong, soft consensus for Base. This is an onchain vote for Base.\n\n### The Process of moving to an L2\n\nMoving to an L2 happens in the following steps:\n\n1\\. Pause  the Auction and update Governance Settings (This prop)\n\n- We must Pause the Auction to migrate to an L2.\n\n- We are changing the Vote period from 4 days to 2 day to minimize the length of time our Auctions are Paused.\n\n2\\. Migrate the DAO to Base\n\n3\\. Unpause the Auctions on the new Base contracts and change the Governance Settings back to a 4 day Voting Period.\n\n4\\. Bridge the Mainnet Treasury To Base\n\n- We can bridge any amount we want and as many times as we want.

      "content": "## TLDR;\n\nThis proposal funds the sponsorship of the Farcaster Community Meetup in Paris on February 20, 2024, hosted at [CØR studio](https://cor-studio.fr/) rented from [Superchief Gallery](https://www.superchiefgallery.com/). The requested budget is 0.3 ETH. As the date of the meetup is too close, this proposal is suggested to be executed retroactively.\n\nEvent link: [https://events.xyz/3bdc96c1](https://events.xyz/3bdc96c1)\n\n## Description\n\nThe end of February in Paris is set to be a busy time for the web3 space, with two major events [Bright Moments Paris](https://www.brightmoments.io/paris) (February 21-24) and [NFT Paris](https://www.nftparis.xyz/) (February 23-24). A lot of people are travelling to Paris these dates and with the increasing presence of art on Farcaster, it was decided to host a community meetup the day before these main events.\n\nInitially expecting around 40 attendees, we now have 105 confirmed attendees a day before the event, with a venue capacity of 120 people. The meetup's general theme is centered around art and community vibes. To showcase Farcaster art, [artists and collectors have been encouraged to submit their artworks for display](https://warpcast.com/kugusha.eth/0xaebc5430) on a digital screen in the gallery during the meetup. The playlist consists of community-submitted artworks, including a few Purple Season 2 tokens. The POAP for this meetup was created by French artist @pierrepauze.\n\n\nDue to higher than anticipated demand, we are requesting additional funds to cover extra costs.\n\nEntities currently involved:\n\n- Bright Moments, which allocated initial funding through their community grants program (covering the location costs) + providing the artwork display tech during the event.\n- Base, which is providing Based pizzas.\n\nThe meetup is hosted by [@kugusha.eth](https://warpcast.com/kugusha.eth) with support from [@pauline-unik](https://warpcast.com/pauline-unik), [@pedrowww](https://warpcast.com/pedrowww), and members of the Bright Moments team.\n\n## Budget\n\nWe propose a budget of 0.3 ETH to cover expenses for this event, including drinks (wine, beer, soft drinks) for attendees.\n\nAt today's exchange rate, 0.3 ETH is equivalent to 817 EUR. The expected number of attendees is 120.\n\n## Multisig\n\nA new multisig wallet between [@kugusha.eth](https://warpcast.com/kugusha.eth), [@henry](https://warpcast.com/henry), and [@pauline-unik](https://warpcast.com/pauline-unik) has been created for this proposal at the mainnet address: eth:0xf4bE55a8063BEbb5473ab958067dfD9e385CD07d.\n\nThe multisig members, who are the meetup organizers have agreed to approve/deny reimbursements on behalf of the DAO.",

      "title": "Proposal for Purple to support Farcon",
      "content": "**TLDR**\nThis proposal requests 5 ETH to help fund Farcon swag and 5 ETH to help fund the three day Hackathon that will accompany Farcon. The team (lead by Ted) has already secured locations, speakers, sponsors, and much more. We have over 500 applications to the event and close to 200 precommits. The first tranche of 120 tickets was released and was purchased almost immediately. The funds from this grant will primarily go towards hackathon venues, assistance stipends, and high quality swag that attendees will want to bring back into the world to proliferateFarcaster and start conversations about it.\n\n**Why is  this a good fit for Purple?**\nPurple’s mission is to help proliferate and expand the Farcaster ecosystem. For Farcaster to grow while maintaining its character, it cannot be a purely online phenomenon. The idea of URL -> IRL is that having in person events will help solidify the connections and relationships made online. Doing so will increase the resilience of Farcaster’s human network, energizing attendees and demonstrating to the broader world the power of Farcaster to connect people in meaningful ways. Together with the hackathon, we expect Farcon to increase qDAU in a few ways. First, the hackathon will expose more builders and creators to Farcaster as we expect incredible and viral projects to be incubated through it. Second, the conversion from URL -> IRL will lead attendees to invest more in Farcaster afterwards, both through increased and higher quality casting, as well as through evangelizing the protocol by sharing their experience at Farcon. Finally, we expect Farcon to generate attention outside the Farcaster ecosystem - future qDAUs will see Farcon and want to be a part of it. \n\n\n**Overview**\nLast year Grin & Cameron hosted the first Farcon in Boston. The event was well loved by attendees and a great kickoff to the URL<>IRL flywheel. This year we’re going big with five days of programming - a welcome party on Wednesday the 1st, the Summit itself on Thursday the 2nd, and the Hackathon/Side events weekend the 3rd-5th. Here is a link announcing all the side events and sponsors we’ve announced so far\n\nLarger events mean more logistics and costs. It also means being more dependent on sponsors. Support from Purple will help us ensure the influence of the community is well represented when weighing the tradeoffs that have to be made during planning. \n\n**Budget**\nThe total requested budget is 10ETH. 5 ETH for Farcon and 5 ETH for the Hackathon. This budget will be used to create high quality Farcaster swag without the influence of for-profit sponsors. We’ll use some of the money to cover down payments on venues for the Hackathon. Finally we’re going to use some money as assistance stipends for whoever is accepted and needs it. Here is a more detailed breakdown of what we plan to use it for. Though these are estimates, we will do our best to spend the grant in these proportions, with the priority for any remaining funds being (1) assistance stipends (2) swag and (3) venue costs. We commit to providing an accounting of the exact use of the funds with links to the transactions originating from the multisig so Purple can evaluate the effectiveness of this grant and use the information to help inform future forward-looking grants.\n\n**Hackathon**\n\n- **4 ETH Venue Costs** We haven’t released the ability to sign up for the hackathon yet but we are looking at many venues and know the cost will be around this amount. While there will be grassroots locations that pop up, we need to provide hacking space to anyone looking to build on Farcaster over the weekend.\n*Example: The Venue for the summit is $7500 + F&B + Tax + Tip = $22k (~8 ETH) for only 175 people*\n\n- **1 ETH Assistance Stipends:** We’ve already handed out about 20 scholarship passes at $200 each just from individual donations. \nWe offer assistance to everyone who applies. We don’t show that field when considering applications. This means we let individuals in based on their apparent dedication to Farcaster. If they then need assistance, we provide it. \n\n**Farcon:**\nFarcon isn’t run by Farcaster. We are organizing this to help grow the Farcaster community. As such there is nobody with the monetary incentive to create purely Farcaster swag. Purple sponsoring the swag will enable us to produce high quality purely-Farcaster/Farcon branded items that attendees will want to show off to the world, starting many conversations with future qDAUs.\n\n- 4 ETH Farcaster Swag: We want to create amazing high quality swag for the Farcon Summit attendees and community pass holders. \n\n- 1 ETH Farcaster Stickers: We want to make arun of several thousand Farcaster stickers for the hackathon and side events. The proliferation of these stickers will lead to the proliferation of the Farcaster protocol as the talented builders attending the hackathon put these on their laptops and bags, and share them with their local communities of developers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Multisig**\nA new ⅔ multisig has been created on Ethereum mainnet with @matthew, @mcbain, and @ted as signers. We’ll use this multisig to collect funds and approve reimbursements.\n\n**Multisig Address:**\n0x5e1b182e53f44a72E556FD1dAE0C24A077Cfbe38\n\n\n**Test transaction sending ETH from the Farcon Multisig to Purple:**\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0x01c22881fc58caef7ab270603dea306955641e2272e059676b7b01e288ee028e\n\n\n",

      "title": "PurpleDAO funds the ETHDenver Farcaster 2024 Meetup",
      "content": "### TLDR: \nThis proposal requests 4 ETH to fund a Farcaster meetup at ETHDenver 2024. The meetup will take place on March 2nd at 5pm. We’ve chosen a venue right in downtown Denver, which we’ll reveal next when RSVPs go live next week.\n\n### Overview:\nLast year at ETHDenver, a small group of us decided to host a small Farcaster meetup, and it was more successful than anyone expected. Beyond the tons of activity and FOMO it drove on Farcaster, offline it was a night to remember, and tons of IRL friendships were made. This year we hope to follow it up with another incredible meetup.\n\nIn the last year, the community has grown significantly, and our #1 priority is to find a venue that allows for anyone who wants to attend to do so. We’ve found a truly awesome venue this year that has capacity for 550 people (more than double last year’s spot) and is right downtown by the train station. We’ll have the space, food, and drinks for four hours, 5-9pm on Saturday.\n\n### Budget:\nThe requested budget for this event is 4 ETH. We’re proposing to use 1 ETH of that total to cover @matthew and @mcbain’s travel to Denver, since we’re going to be on-the-ground planning and executing on the meetup. The remaining 3 ETH will go towards paying for the venue, alongside generous sponsorships from Base, POAP, and Privy.\n\nAll-in, the subtotal for the venue is $20k, and with tax and tip it will likely come out to $27k. If there are any funds left over, we’ll contribute them to this year’s FarCon costs.\n\n### Multisig\n\nA new ⅔ multisig has been created on Ethereum mainnet at the address eth:0x1D57753ac029fe06f79271F1aB30dF389904Dbf1, with @matthew, @mcbain, and @ccarella as signers. We’ll use this multisig to collect funds and approve reimbursements.\n\nThank you all for your continued support and we could not be more excited to bring our community together once again in just over a month!!\n\n- @matthew, @mcbain, and @ccarella\n",

      "title": "Predictable retroactive funding rounds H1 2024",
      "content": "This proposal is modeled after [Prop 31](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xa45662638e9f3bbb7a6fecb4b17853b7ba0f3a60/vote/31), with minor changes highlighted below!\n\nThis is a proposal to fund 3 more Prop House rounds for retroactive funding of builders in the Farcaster ecosystem. The goal is to provide predictable times when builders can expect an opportunity to be rewarded by Purple. The proposal will move 15 ETH into the Prop House multisig, and Prop House rounds will be set up for voting on:\n\n* January 31\n* April 30\n* July 31\n\n*Note:* the proposed round rewards are different from Prop 31, and winners will receive:\n\n* Places 1-3: 1 ETH each\n* Places 4-13: 0.2 ETH each\n\n### Prop House Multisig\n\nThe Prop House multisig is responsible for distributing funds to winners of Purple Prop House rounds. Purple members vote for the grant applications they wish to see funded and the Prop House multisig must respect the outcome and quickly distribute funds to the winners.\n\nThere has been some discussion of rotating the members of the multisig, but that can happen outside the scope of this prop as necessary.\n\n### History\n\nThe first retroactive funding round was the first funding proposal passed by Purple and consisted of 5 ETH to be distributed as gifts for retroactive contributions to the Farcaster ecosystem. Subsequently, Prop 31 was passed to establish a schedule for rounds going forward. Now that the scheduled rounds have been completed, this proposal aims to schedule 6 more months of rounds for the first half of 2024.\n\n### Details\n\nRetroactive gifts are a thank you to all of the developers and community members who have already been building things on Farcaster. Anyone with an Ethereum address can propose that their own project or someone else's be considered for a retroactive gift. To be eligible for these rounds, grant recipients must have performed work prior to the start date of the proposal, and must submit their proposal with an address connected to a Farcaster account. Projects which have not yet started, proposals for future work, and proposals submitted by addresses not associated with a Farcaster account are ineligible for retroactive funding. A winner may submit again to a future funding round but must disclose their prior Purple funding.\n\nOnce each funding period ends, a voting period will start where Purple holders may vote for the proposal they believe should get funded (1 Purple token = 10 votes). Winners are simply those proposals which have the most votes.\n\nIf passed, the funds would be released from the Treasury and sent to the Prop House multisig. The Prop House multisig is responsible for distributing funds at the end of each round’s voting period to the winners.\n\nFor more information on Prop House, please visit https://prop.house.",

The event is hosted by [Local Public](https://twitter.com/localpublicxyz), group of people in Mumbai, coming together to build from our city, inspired by ETHRome, ETHChicago, and ETHBarcelona and glad to be learning and supported by them. The proposal is for the sponsor budget of $5,000 USD.\n\nWebsite link: [ethmumbai.in](https://ethmumbai.in)\n\n**Description**\n\nETHMumbai will be the first ever ethereum hackathon in the heart of Mumbai, both share the same spirit of freedom and opportunities. Founders from Mumbai include Polygon, Push Protocol, Buidlers Tribe and we are creating more opportunities for stronger ethereum projects to be built out of this hackathon.\n\nThe hackathon will have 300+ hackers and 200+ floating footfall of attendees including speakers, special guests, mentors, and industry leaders. It will have 40+ hours of coding, 10+ hours of IRL workshops, 20+ hours of online workshops, 100+ expected projects, and $100,000+ in bounties.\n\nThe hackathon will have 3 major tracks: Privacy, Social, DeFi. This gives us the opportunity to maximize clients on top of Farcaster during the hackathon. We will also have share guides and ideas with developers to help them unique clients.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/Mp0Q1Sqk/ETHMumbai-Sponsor-Deck-5.png)\n\n**Budget**\n\nWe are proposing sponsorship 2.5 ETH of which:\n\n- 1.5 ETH will be distributed as bounties to top projects in Farcaster sponsor track\n- 1 ETH will be used for logistics which includes: online and on-ground branding, conducting workshops, team working to create track guide for hackers\n\nETHMumbai has a wallet address with ens [ethmumbai.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/ethmumbai.eth), which will be used to store and transfer funds for the event, as necessary.\n\n**Judging**\n\nWe think the best judges for Farcaster sponsor track will be the developers who have built several apps already in the Farcaster ecosystem. Judging criteria will be set in the month of January 2024 and we will reach out to all the amazing developers on Farcaster to understand who can take part in this.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/hGgVYGpP/ETHMumbai-Sponsor-Deck-1.png)",

Exact dates are TBD, but roughly we're looking around the Feb/March timeline.\n\nThe requested budget for this event is 5,000 USDC (equivalent in ETH) with excess being returned back to DAO if ETH price were to change. Warpcast is also matching upto $1k contribution from the DAO.\n\n**Description**\n\n[LearnWeb3](https://learnweb3.io/) is the largest web3 developer community with over 130k+ students. We create high-quality developer focused education as public good, and also offer bounties, hackathons. live events, weekly discussions, trivia competitions, job search assistance, and much more. \n\nThe Decentralized Intelligence Hackathon focuses on the intersection of AI x Crypto and Season 1 saw some amazing projects being built ranging from Web3 GPT's to Intent Wallets to AI-Assisted Chains Dataset Querying and much more. The full list of past projects from Season 1 can be found here - https://learnweb3.io/hackathons/decentralized-intelligence-season-1/projects\n\nWith Season 2, it is coming back bigger and better than ever. We are aiming for a $100k total prize pool across all sponsors. For Farcaster, we are requesting Purple co-sponsor the bounties along with Warpcast's $1k match. The end goal is to have more hackers learn and build on Farcaster and bolster the FC community further.\n\nWe expect at least 500+ hackers and 50+ projects being submitted total, and are confident FC will see some amazing projects being built. In the worst case scenario where no projects are deemed quality enough, the bounty will be returned back to the DAO, though we do not expect this will happen.\n\nThe hackathon also has no overall prize pool, so bounty sponsorship goes directly to hackers for bounties set by the DAO (more on this later) and you will not be paying part of your bounty to projects that may not even have built on Farcaster.\n\n**Budget**\n\nWe ask Purple fund 5,000 USDC - listed as 2.5 ETH at the time of creating this proposal given current prices. \n\nPurple's 5000 USDC + Warpcast's 1000 USDC = Total 6,000 USDC. 85% of this (5k USDC) will go to hackers for bounties, and 1k USDC will be the logistics and management fees for LearnWeb3.\n\nIf ETH/USDC was to increase when this proposal is executed, we will return any excess back to the DAO. If ETH/USDC was to decrease, as long as the decrease is within the 1,000 USDC, we will cover the difference from our logistics fees.\n\nThe proposal has a transaction attached to transfer 2.5 ETH to LearnWeb3's wallet.\n\n\n**Volunteer Request**\n\nIn addition to monetary funding, we would like to get recommendations and volunteer mentors and judges for the hackathon. We will be reaching out to Dan, Varun, and the Neynar team. In addition, we are open to the Purple Strategy Council proposing volunteer mentors and judges. \n\nOverall it would be awesome to see 2-3 total volunteers from the Farcaster Ecosystem depending on the availability of folks. These 2-3 volunteers will be our points of contact for setting up the bounties, conducting project judging, and offering support to hackers during the hackathon. Aside from volunteers, I ([haardik.eth](https://warpcast.com/haardikkk)) personally will be helping hackers out with developer support for building on FC as well on behalf of LearnWeb3, but I will not be involved in judging the project submissions.\n\n**Feedback and Discussion**\n\nIf you have any feedback or would like to request changes to this proposal, you can reach out to me on Warpcast [@haardik.eth](https://warpcast.com/haardikkk) or email me at haardik@learnweb3.io",

      "title": "Create a legal entity for Purple with MIDAO",
      "content": "🛡 **Create a legal entity for Purple** 🛡 \n\nProposal by @cojo.eth (Colin Johnson) & @thethriller (Adam Miller)\n\n**Tl;dr**\n\nThis proposal aims to establish a legal wrapper for Purple, creating a robust legal structure to protect members, enable larger grants, and attract more token buyers.\n\n**Summary**\n\nCurrently, Purple operates without a formal legal structure, which poses several risks and limitations. By creating a legal wrapper, we can protect our members from individual legal & tax liability, qualify for substantial institutional grants, and appeal to high net worth individuals. The proposal suggests forming a Marshall Island DAO LLC through MIDAO, which offers cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and minimal administrative burden. This structure requires no centralization of power or significant action from DAO members.\n\n**Rationale**\n\n1. Member Protection: A legal wrapper shields members from individual legal & tax liabilities in legal matters, safeguarding personal assets.\n\n2. Grant Eligibility: As a nonprofit public goods DAO, Purple stands to benefit significantly from institutional grants, which require a clear legal entity for fund transfer.\n\n3. Enhancing Membership Appeal: A legal wrapper reduces risk for potential high net worth or regulatory-conscious token buyers, thereby expanding our treasury capabilities.\n\n**Proposed Entity**\n\nThe choice of a Marshall Island DAO LLC aligns with our needs for cost, flexibility, and minimal administrative burden. This structure has been vetted against various other forms like 501c3s, LLCs, and is found to be most advantageous for our scenario.\n\n**Impact on Members**\n\nThis change does not alter member rights or responsibilities. Voting remains on-chain, and the selection of a figurehead for organizational contact purposes does not confer any special powers or responsibilities. This proposition really just provides legal protection for members without any substantial change in day to day activities.\n\n**Precedent**\n\nSeveral prominent DAOs have successfully implemented legal wrappers, demonstrating the viability and necessity of this approach in today's environment.\n\n- Nouns\n- BuilderDAO\n- LexDAO\n- Friends with Benefits\n- Many more\n\n**References and Research**\n\nDetailed information and discussions with MIDAO are available for members to review on the charmverse page [https://app.charmverse.io/purple/legal-wrapper-overview-prop-37-initiative-49699958710444525](url)\n\nPositive feedback and recommendations like the recent one below from Admiral DAO support this approach:\n\nAre you glad you did it?\n\n“I would honestly not even bother considering anything else. The brain damage + fees these other structures were going to take of $100K+. This was like the MIDAO fee and a few hours of legal time.” \n\n\t-Mark Lurie, Founder, Admiral DAO LLC, which governs the Clipper Exchange\n\n**Timeline**\n\n1. Vote closes\n2. 1 week for KYC of 1 (or optionally more) volunteer\n3. 4-6 weeks to develop the operating agreement in conjunction with the MIDAO team\n4. Submission to Marshall Islands via MIDAO\n5. One month review by Marshall Islands before receiving charter\n\nThis proposal is a strategic step towards securing Purple's future, enhancing its operational capabilities, and safeguarding its members. It's a forward-looking initiative aligning with Purple's ethos of innovation while providing community protection.\n\n**Cost**\n\nSetup: 3 ETH (~$6K)\n\nAdam Miller, a Purple member and MIDAO founder, has offered guidance and discounted rates (usually $9,500) for this setup.\n\nThere is an annual fee after the first year of between $1,500 and $5,000 per year, depending on treasury size at the time fees are due, as outlined on [https://www.midao.org/pricing](url)\n\nAll these fees include all MIDAO & government fees. There are no hidden fees and no requirement to hire any local law firm or other representatives as is required in many other jurisdictions. Certified documents, future government filings, and document templates are all included in these fees.\n",

Media, art and content, highlighting Farcaster, would be eligible for Quadratic Funding grants, using [Gitcoin’s project manager.](https://manager.gitcoin.co/)\n\nPurple will partner with Gitcoin, MetaCartel and Bankless to bring attention to and provide funding for media projects that focus on How We Connect.\n\nMedia creators will submit their work using Gitcoin tools. The Internet community \"votes\" by rewarding the project with any amount of ETH on Optimism. Purple's 1 ETH will be allocated to the projects based on Quadratic Funding. This is retroactive funding for media, art and content already created and submitted. \n\n### Reasons for\n\nWith a focus on \"how we connect\", a media round, in collaboration with value aligned organizations, including Gitcoin, MetaCartel and Bankless, with encouragement for showcasing the benefits of Farcaster, this has the potential to bring more users, creators and builders onto Farcaster, as well as raise awareness of Purple.\n\nThis is a small test of Quadratic Funding to better understand the kind of participation it drives and how Purple can use QF in the future. Learnings from testing this hypothesis will be shared with everyone at Purple and the Farcaster Community at large.\n\nPurple has underinvested in content and media to date and this is a way to experiment with retroactive funding content and media. \n\nPurple would be contributing 1 ETH towards a goal of a 2 ETH pool, with Metacartel matching Purple's contribution of 1 ETH. Purple members and Farcasters users are eligible to submit and be rewarded from the pool.\n\n### Risks & Potential reasons against\n\nMultiple DAOs have proposals up, namely Purple & Metacartel, which provides some coordination risk. If the QF round is not executed, for whatever reason, funds will be returned to Purple.\n\nDue to the public nature of the QF round, some of the funding will potentially go to people who are not in the Farcaster Community. While ideally all of Purple's commitment would go to the FC community, this could also translate to new contributors to Purple and Farcaster, as well as the Farcaster community receiving grants in excess of the 1 ETH contributed.\n\n### Team\n\n[ccarella](https://warpcast.com/ccarella.eth), with support from [Sov](https://warpcast.com/sov) and [Owocki](https://warpcast.com/owocki) at Gitcoin, [BorrowLucid](https://warpcast.com/borrowlucid) at MetaCartel and Chones, and [jengajojo](https://warpcast.com/jengajojo) at Bankless\n\n\n### Budget \n\n1 ETH\n\nAll funds go towards a matching pool in the Quadratic Funding round.\n\nIf the QF round is not executed, for whatever reason, funds will be returned to Purple.\n\n### The Multisig \nFunds will be sent to the following 2/3 multisig: \n0x455fd3B375ac86cbcddb7cCA1ceD7DdF6FbD1eD6\n\nSigners are:\n\n- [ccarella](https://warpcast.com/ccarella.eth)\n- [Sov](https://warpcast.com/sov)\n- [BorrowLucid](https://warpcast.com/borrowlucid)\n\n### Public Description\n\nAs we all come together for Devconnect, we recognize that many of us will be participating virtually.

Also, thank you to [MetaCartel](https://www.metacartel.org/manifesto) for their support!\n\nPlease create projects for this Quadratic Funding round that showcase media, art and content that you, or your team, have already published, on any platform, including [Farcaster](https://warpcast.com/), which helps us stay connected, whether in Istanbul or on the internet.\n\nAnyone with a [Gitcoin Passport](https://bridge.gitcoin.co/) can signal support for their favorite media by making a donation on Optimism.

Bankless is looking forward to participating in the media round from their communication channels. FWB is considering a budget for an event, during Devconnect, at which the QF rounds will be shared with attendees. Gitcoin will potentially provide matching funds to create a larger round.",

      "content": "![](https://i.imgur.com/tYgL1k7.png)\n### TLDR;\n\nThis proposal funds the sponsorship of the Farcaster Meetup occuring at ETH Lisbon. The meetup will be held at [Cerveja Canil Marques](https://www.cervejacanil.com/) who offered us the space for free. We will be co-hosting with [Public Good IPA](https://www.publicgood.wtf/), an Open Source beer that was recently [funded by Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/vote/378\n). This event is co-hosted by [@ccarella.eth](https://warpcast.com/ccarella.eth) (Purple, CharmVerse), [@annoushka.eth](https://warpcast.com/annoushka.eth) (Purple, Interface) and [@favioseva.eth](https://warpcast.com/fabioseva) (Public Good IPA, participating in ETH Lisbon hackathon). \n\nThe requested budget for this event is 0.5 ETH.\n\n### Description\n\nETH Lisbon is an Ethereum-focused hackathon bringing together the best Web3 builders to the crypto capital of Europe. It is a three-day event where developers can compete to build innovative projects using the Ethereum blockchain. The event is also home to a summit with talks and workshops from leading experts in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nETH Lisbon is organized by ETHGlobal, a non-profit organization that supports the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem. ETHGlobal has hosted hackathons in over 30 cities around the world, and ETH Lisbon is one of their most anticipated events of the year.\n\nFarcaster is one of the leading Decentralised Social Web projects in the world with an ever-growing and vibrant community with a deep passion and dedication for evolving the future of the web.\n\n**The ETH Lisbon Farcaster Meetup** is a community event and a short social break for the teams participating in the Hackathon, who can meet and be surrounded by the energy of other Farcaster builders. It's also intended to showcase all the amazing builders on Farcaster to hackathon participants who have yet to join Farcaster. [RSVP on Luma and join us](https://lu.ma/w99jv5bs)!\n\n### Local Co-hosts\n\n[@annoushka.eth](https://warpcast.com/annoushka.eth) & [@favioseva.eth](https://warpcast.com/fabioseva) live in Lisbon and have been working with the on the ground logistics. Additionally, [@favioseva.eth](https://warpcast.com/fabioseva) is participating in the Hackathon. Finally, [@favioseva.eth](https://warpcast.com/fabioseva) recently hosted an event at [Cerveja Canil Marques](https://www.cervejacanil.com/) for Polygon.\n\n### Event Schedule\n\n16:00 - Reception\n\n17:00 - Finger Food\n\n18:00 - Band Interval\n\n19:00 - Acknowledgement and Giveways\n\n19:00 - End\n\n### Budget\n\nWe’re proposing Purple cover 0.5 ETH of a total 1 ETH budget for this event. Public Goods IPA will cover the remaining 0.5 ETH.\n\nWe’ve calculated the costs as follows:\n\n- Drinks & Food: $800\n- Photographer & Videographer: $200\n- Pins, stickers, Nouns Glasses: $100\n\nTotal: $1100\n\n1 ETH at current prices is valued at around $1750. In case of any leftover funds following event expenses, we intend to send them back to the DAO. With the recent volatility of ETH we want to have a little protection.\n\n### Multisig\n\nA new ⅔ multisig has been created for this proposal: \n\neth:0xfdA0cDD918c952DA19c63D632B2dbe1e10f32C8F\n\nThe multisig members, who are the meetup organizers have agreed to approve/deny reimbursements on behalf of the DAO.\n\n[ccarella.eth](https://warpcast.com/ccarella.eth)\n\n[annoushka.eth](https://warpcast.com/annoushka.eth)\n\n[fabioseva.eth](https://warpcast.com/fabioseva)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ElvTT5v.jpg)",

What does Purple Season 2 represent in the memetic and artistic evolution of Purple DAO? Let’s start with the technical limitations and specifications. The Nouns DAO style generative mechanism works by randomly generating images, stacked one on top of the other, like a cake. PFPs work like this so most people are familiar. Repetition of composition works with facial forms: head, eyes, etc. This restriction is more of a puzzle and challenge when creating complex works of art. Each element in each layer must work with every other element in every other layer, like a Calder mobile. An introduced element might work in dozens of iterations but the mobile collapses on the thirteenth try, so that element is scrapped. My approach was to create quadrant based generative compositions. This solved several problems, it gave each of seven layers specific spaces to inhabit. This keeps the overall composition from feeling repetitive and keeps each element from stepping on the toes of others. There are 7 layers: background, middle, foreground, horizontal, vertical overlay and corners. Each has a different number of slides for an overall possibility of ~24 million combinations. This design decision also gives Season 2 a unique and distinctive feel. The gestural and painterly elements are mostly from my hand, digital drawings. Each layer 1 background slide is either purple or partially purple for cohesion and recognition. The overall effect is something like abstract iconography, a barn quilt, or Rorschach. They signify, guide, and also interrogate. The addition of empty slides in the set can create austere minimalism or colorful maximalist eruptions. The artist’s hand shows, they’re subjective and aesthetically have a point of view. This is on purpose and hopefully a beacon for future seasons of Purple and projects like it in the space, specifically those pondering the possibilities of organization/artist collaborations.\n\n### Schedule & Guidelines\nThe new art is scheduled to transition in on October 25th - the one year anniversary of Purple DAO, and the date voted on [in this channel survey.](https://warpcast.com/survey/0xb313c6b1)\n\nRules, guidelines and additional details can be found in the original Prop ([Prop 35](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xa45662638e9f3bbb7a6fecb4b17853b7ba0f3a60/vote/0xafa6136e4245c363b0d9b219e04185dd6c13af411180381c9f224340fb855e0a))\n\n### Sample Artworks\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/merkle-manufactory/image/fetch/c_fill,f_jpg/https://i.imgur.com/sILxden.jpg)\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/merkle-manufactory/image/fetch/c_fill,f_jpg/https://i.imgur.com/OQs0MQV.jpg\n)",

What does Purple Season 2 represent in the memetic and artistic evolution of Purple DAO? Let’s start with the technical limitations and specifications. The Nouns DAO style generative mechanism works by randomly generating images, stacked one on top of the other, like a cake. PFPs work like this so most people are familiar. Repetition of composition works with facial forms: head, eyes, etc. This restriction is more of a puzzle and challenge when creating complex works of art. Each element in each layer must work with every other element in every other layer, like a Calder mobile. An introduced element might work in dozens of iterations but the mobile collapses on the thirteenth try, so that element is scrapped. My approach was to create quadrant based generative compositions. This solved several problems, it gave each of seven layers specific spaces to inhabit. This keeps the overall composition from feeling repetitive and keeps each element from stepping on the toes of others. There are 7 layers: background, middle, foreground, horizontal, vertical overlay and corners. Each has a different number of slides for an overall possibility of ~24 million combinations. This design decision also gives Season 2 a unique and distinctive feel. The gestural and painterly elements are mostly from my hand, digital drawings. Each layer 1 background slide is either purple or partially purple for cohesion and recognition. The overall effect is something like abstract iconography, a barn quilt, or Rorschach. They signify, guide, and also interrogate. The addition of empty slides in the set can create austere minimalism or colorful maximalist eruptions. The artist’s hand shows, they’re subjective and aesthetically have a point of view. This is on purpose and hopefully a beacon for future seasons of Purple and projects like it in the space, specifically those pondering the possibilities of organization/artist collaborations.\n\n# Schedule & Guidelines\nThe new art is scheduled to transition in on October 25th - the one year anniversary of Purple DAO, and the date voted on in [this channel survey](https://warpcast.com/survey/0xb313c6b1).\n\nRules, guidelines and additional details can be found in the original Prop ([Prop 35](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xa45662638e9f3bbb7a6fecb4b17853b7ba0f3a60/vote/0xafa6136e4245c363b0d9b219e04185dd6c13af411180381c9f224340fb855e0a)) \n\n# Sample Artworks\n\n![example 1](https://res.cloudinary.com/merkle-manufactory/image/fetch/c_fill,f_jpg/https://i.imgur.com/sILxden.jpg)\n\n![example 2](https://res.cloudinary.com/merkle-manufactory/image/fetch/c_fill,f_jpg/https://i.imgur.com/OQs0MQV.jpg)",

The time and location are signaled by the Ethereum Foundation and communities independently organize events throughout the week(s). \n\n**Farconnect @ Devconnect** is a social gathering to connect with devs and casters offchain. [Farconnect](https://farconnect.xyz/) welcomes everyone to join and vibe. Farconnect, inspired by FarCon, is an unconference - if you would like to give a talk or join a panel, please direct cast [@ekinci.eth](https://warpcast.com/ekinci.eth).\n\n### Budget\nWe’re proposing Purple cover 2 ETH of a total 3.9 ETH budget for this event. The remaining 1.9 ETH are being co-sponsored by sponsors [typhon.vc](https://typhon.vc/) an early stage DeSo VC ($1000), [punk.domains](https://punk.domains/) ($420), [frens.lol](https://frens.lol/) (0.25ETH) and [blocto.io](https://blocto.io/) (0.25ETH). [Eventcaster](https://eventcaster.xyz/) and the remaining Farcaster EthCC budget add $870 to the budget for a total of $3060 or 1.9 ETH at current prices.\n\n**We’ve calculated the costs as follows:**\n- $2115.00 (58.800 TL) to reserve the venue for 150 people\n- $670.00 (18.600 TL) for renting the sound and visual systems (incl. mandatory technician)\n- $3240.00 (90.000 TL) for unlimited (alcoholic) beverages.\n\n**Total:**\n- $6025.00 including 20% VAT \n- ≈ $40 per headcount (value might fluctuate depending on TL/USD rate)\n\n3.90 ETH at current prices. In case of any leftover funds following event expenses, we intend to send them back to the DAO. The full list of expenses and options can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/farconnect/farconnect.github.io/blob/master/expenses/istanbul.md).\n\n### Multisig\nA new ⅔ multisig has been created for this proposal at mainnet address: 0x506bD2a7993fc6e6a5C68e0A4B6AdFfA4539d003\n\n[Matthew](https://warpcast.com/matthew) and [Antimofm.eth](https://warpcast.com/antimofm.eth) have agreed to approve/deny reimbursements on behalf of the DAO.\n",

      "title": "Purple Strategy Refresh 2023",
      "content": "Proposal:  Purple strategy refresh.\n\n**Context:** Every successful organization periodically evaluates its mission, values, vision, growth priorities, and strategic initiatives to accomplish them. Purple launched in 2023 with a strong vision to proliferate and expand the Farcaster protocol and ecosystem by funding small grants via Prop House and larger on-chain proposals. Both the Purple and Farcaster communities have grown significantly over the last few quarters. It is time to refine the strategy, considering the promising growth.\n\n**What:** A core working group consisting of Purple members Cameron Armstrong (@Cameron), Colin Johnson (@cojo.eth), Chris Carella (@ccarella), Ben Ersing (@0xBenErsing.eth), and one additional member to be voted on by the community, will draft a revised high-level strategic plan for the DAO. The plan will include Mission, Values, Vision, Governance Operating Model, 3-5 strategic priorities/objectives, and 1 core and 2-3 supplemental key performance metrics to track progress against our goals. Like Brian Armstrong’s recent “Startups I Would Build Today” article, we will also draft an illustrative list of initiatives/projects that we think would be most beneficial for members of the DAO to pursue. They will be suggestions to spur conversation and further community ideation. \n\nThe output of this entire exercise will not be binding or Constitutional in nature. It will provide additional guidance and structure for the DAO as it embarks on its next growth phase. The plan will balance strategic structure with fluidity to allow innovation to surface and flourish within a decentralized organization.\n\nWe recognize and acknowledge the challenges inherent to crafting and ratifying a strategy that members of a distributed organization can agree on. As such, we view this process as an experiment in itself: one that will produce both process-oriented and content-specific output and learnings. It is our hope that in addition to directly benefiting the Purple community, the learnings and approach might also benefit others working to optimize DAO governance and direction. \n\nThe drafting team will periodically hold live-streams via Unlonely during which time Purple members can review the progress being made, ask questions and provide input mid-workstream.\n\nA draft of the revised strategy will be made publicly available for DAO member comments and revisions. All DAO member inputs will be thoughtfully considered, and many will be incorporated.\nA final draft of the strategy will be put to a community vote before ratification. If the strategy is not approved by the community, the core working group will work with community members to refine the strategy and align on a path forward.\n\n**Team Selection**: The drafting team was carefully selected based on the following process and qualifications. In order to operate as efficiently as possible, we decided to keep the drafting team to 4 people; expecting that while the drafting team would do the heavy lifting and be accountable for producing a final output, the entire community will be involved in the strategy formulation process and proposal approval.\n\nProcess\n1.\tA public call to action / request for expressions of interest to participate was posted on the Purple Channel on Warpcast on numerous occasions over a period of 5+ weeks (see here and here). A total of 14 individuals expressed interest in contributing to the process in some way.\n\n2.\tIndividuals were considered on the basis of the following criteria: \na.\tCurrent, active member of Purple\n\nb.\tDepth and breadth of work experience relevant to strategy formulation and / or DAO governance / management\n\nc.\tAvailability to commit ~3 hours per week for 10-12 weeks starting as soon as the proposal is approved by the community \n\n3.\tAll individuals selected have made verbal commitments of their ability to dedicate this time.\nTeam Qualifications\n\n[TBD] \n-\tThe final team member will be selected via PropHouse lottery vote\n-\tMinimum 20 votes \n\nCameron Armstrong (ENS: realcameron.eth | LinkedIn)\n-\tFounder, VF Protocol\n-\tStrategy Council, ServeDAO\n-\tFinance Development Leadership Program, Amazon\n-\tLeadership Instructor, Officer Candidate School, U.S. Army\n-\tEducation: Virginia Military Institute & Harvard Business School  \n\nColin Johnson (ENS: cojo.eth | LinkedIn)\n-\tCo-Founder & CEO, Freeport\n-\tMarketing Lead, Apple Cash\n-\tSenior Manager, American Express\n-\tEducation: Princeton\n\nChris Carella (ENS: ccarella.eth | LinkedIn)\n-\tHead of Product, CharmVerse \n-\tVenture Partner, Five Four Ventures\n-\tEducation: SUNY and Dartmouth\n\nBen Ersing (ENS: 0xBenErsing.eth | LinkedIn)\n-\tPrincipal, Cobalt Ventures\n-\tManager, CVS Health & CVS Health Ventures\n-\tAssociate, Palladium Strategy Consulting & Transaction Advisory\n-\tEducation: Washington & Lee University and New York University\n\n\n**How:**\n1.\tThe core working group will convene, align on the tactical plan to refresh the strategy, and agree on individual responsibilities and timelines.\n\n2.\tTasks will include, but not necessarily limited to:\n2.1.\t5-7 key stakeholder and subject matter expert interviews. Notes will be captured and anonymized. Any Purple DAO member will have access to them. (Duration: 2 weeks, depending on availability)\n\n2.2.\tHigh-level desk research on latest DAO management and growth best practices, and the web3 social ecosystem. (Duration: 2 weeks, depending on availability)\n\n2.3.\t Strategy drafting (Duration: 2 weeks)\n\n2.4.\tPublic socialization and revisions capture period (Duration: 2 weeks)\n\n2.5.\tProposal Submission & Community Vote (Duration: 2 weeks)\n\n2.6.\tPlan Acceptance and/or Revisions & Resubmission (Duration: 0 – 2 weeks, depending on revisions required)\nWhen:\n●\tStart: 1 week after community approval of this Proposal\n●\tEnd: 10-12 weeks from start\n\n**Impact:**\n1.\tContent - the strategic plan itself will provide a framework to help guide future DAO efforts, facilitating even more intentional resource allocation and greater impact.\n\n2.\tProcess - as the first of many refined strategies in the years to come, the approach we take to drafting, refining, and gaining consensus on and then beginning to implement the strategy will be as important to Purple's evolution as the strategy itself.\n\n**Resource Ask**: 5 ETH total. 4 ETH of which will be divided evenly among core drafting team members as an honorarium for their time, and ~1 ETH will be used for miscellaneous costs (i.e., design work, Fiverr data gathering, analysis, etc.). Receipts will be kept and made available to the community. \n\n**Rationale:** In order to align incentives and accountability, we find that some amount of monetary compensation is important to ensuring a top-tier quality output. 5 ETH is the amount allocated to most funding proposals to date. While it will not come close to compensating participants for the market value of their time, it will ensure greater focus and dedication to the committed outcomes.\n",

      "content": "**TLDR:** This proposal funds the sponsorship of an ethCC Farcaster meetup. The meetup will be hosted at [La Felicita](https://www.lafelicita.fr) in Paris. The requested budget for this event is 1 ETH.\n\n**Description:** \n\nethCC is one of the biggest crypto conferences of the year, and the biggest crypto conference in Europe. There are a lot of casters attending this year, and so we think it’s the perfect opportunity to spread the word about the protocol—particularly to the non-US audience.\n\nMeetups, like the ones organized at [NFT NYC](https://www.eventcaster.xyz/events/81247dea-10d0-4181-9b34-fe74296fcef8) and [ETHDenver](https://www.eventcaster.xyz/events/40443d09-280b-4408-b042-9a41a66b31b7), have been hugely successful in the past. They bring builders together, generate excitement around the protocol, and foster new friendships. Most importantly, they make our community stronger.\n\nThe excitement around Farcon this past month was electrifying, but of course many members of our community weren’t able to attend. EthCC is the next opportunity of that magnitude, and we ask for your support so we can make it a similarly exciting time for casters.\n\n**Budget:**\n\nWe’re proposing Purple cover 1 ETH of a total 1.5 ETH budget for this event. [Discove](https://warpcast.com/discove) and [OrangeDAO](https://warpcast.com/orangedao) have offered to cover the remaining .5 ETH.\n\nWe’ve calculated the costs as follows:\n- €1440 to reserve the space for 60 people, with one drink for each attendee and light food\n- €720 for one additional drink per person\n- €360 to purchase extra food and any other misc expenses\n\nTotal: €2520\n\n1.5 ETH at current prices is valued at around €2,520. But, if there are any leftover funds following reimbursements, we intend to send them back to the DAO.\n\n**Multisig:**\n\nA new ⅔ multisig has been created for this proposal at mainnet address 0x1965982D1A0A6F6461A36940f4DCf7748CDC7C13. All three organizers of the meetup ([@ahn](https://warpcast.com/ahn), [@matthew](https://warpcast.com/matthew), and [@df](https://warpcast.com/df)) have agreed to approve/deny reimbursements on behalf of the DAO.\n",

      "content": "## Description\n\nThis is a Proposal to fund 3 more prop house rounds for retroactive funding of developers building in the Farcaster ecosystem. The goal is to provide predictable times when developers can expect an opportunity to be rewarded by Purple. The proposal will move 15eth into the prop house multisig, and prop house rounds will be set up for voting on\n\n- June 30\n- August 30\n- October 30\n\nEach round will have 5 winners who will receive 1eth each. \n\n## Prop House Multisig\n\nThe Prop House Multisig is responsible for distributing funds to winners of Purple Prop House Rounds. Purple Members vote for the grant applications they wish to see funded and the Prop House Multisig must respect the outcome and quickly distribute funds to the winners.\n\n## History\n\nThe first retroactive funding round was the first funding proposal passed by Purple and consisted of 5 ETH to be distributed as gifts for retroactive contributions to the Farcaster ecosystem.\n\n## Details\n\nRetroactive gifts are a thank you to all of the developers and community members who have already been building things on Farcaster. Anyone with an Ethereum address can propose that their own project or someone else's be considered for a retroactive gift. To be eligible for these rounds, grant recipients must have performed work prior to the start date of the proposal, and must submit their proposal with an address connected to a Farcaster account; projects which have not yet started, proposals for future work, and proposals submitted by addresses not associated with a Farcaster account are ineligible for retroactive funding. A winner may submit again to a future funding round but must disclose their prior Purple funding.\n\nOnce each funding period ends, a voting period will start where Purple holders may vote for the proposal they believe should get funded (1 Purple = 10 votes). Winners are simply those proposals which have the most votes.\n\nIf passed, the funds would be released from the Treasury and sent to the Prop House multisig. The Prop House multisig is responsible for distributing funds at the end of each round’s voting period to the winners.\n\nFor more information on Prop House, please visit https://prop.house.",

      "title": "Return Bot Developer Funding To Treasury",
      "content": "tl;dr: Our Bot Developer Prop House round didn't reach submission quorum, so I am proposing we return the funds to the treasury\n\nLonger version: [Proposal 26 (Bot Developer Prop House)](https://nouns.build/dao/0xa45662638e9f3bbb7a6fecb4b17853b7ba0f3a60/vote/0x0478ba533db33e15586134db8d8e450e98e50f9aa409cdf907208abd63f81cff) passed with 21 FOR votes and 0 AGAINST votes. \n\nThis result was based on momentum from a [high engagement cast](https://warpcast.com/phil/0xee1bf8) where I suggested (based on Andrei's observation) that we should take advantage of the momentum from Twitter's new ToS to attract bot developers to Farcaster. \n\nUltimately, the Prop had more community support than developer support, only garnering 3 submissions.  This raises questions about what to do next:\n- Should we distribute 1 ETH to all three developers? \n- Should we distribute the complete 5 ETH between the three developers?\n- What do the votes even mean if all of them are guaranteed to win.\n\nThe voting is intended to be an implicit filter mechanism, and it assumes there are more applicants than winners. Rather than award ETH to all of the developers who applied, I think we should take this as a sign of a lack of traction for the idea and return the $ to the treasury. \n\nIn the future, we should consider alternate funding mechanisms to encourage developer to move to Farcaster, including [a smaller bounty program for members](https://warpcast.com/phil/0x3943b8). \n\nIf passed, this Proposal will execute a self-txn, sending 0.01 ETH from the treasury to the treasury. More importantly, it will indicate to signers of the Small Grants multisig that they should return the 5 ETH rather than making a judgement call about how to split up the funds for the 3 developers who applied.\n\nTo the developers who applied: thank you for taking the time. This is not an indictment of your proposal or the quality of your work, and I encourage you to submit for a future retroactive funding round if you do decide to continue the migration.",

I am looking forward to the collaboration between Purple and BLVKHVND, with the belief that it will proliferate Farcaster in the esport universe.]\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeia6v7ebankrvtqnha3ij4i5rkkursmthp45pzmbkltfosz4pkgmq4)\n\n### Tl;dr [the ask] \nBLVKHVND is requesting 5 ETH from Purple DAO to build a bridge between the HVND and the Purple community and create an esports product to the Farcaster Protocol.\n\n*Technically, this is a 2-in-one prop but will be broken up into 2 individual props. The first is a prop for Purple DAO, the second, BLVKHVND will be producing a prop to further support the development of this campaign*\n\n### Why?\nBLVKHVND seeks to build better relationships and awareness within incredible web3 spaces, proliferating the use of open-source tooling, and becoming the backbone of esports in web3. Purple DAO and the Farcaster protocol gives the HVND the distinct ability to funnel communication and coordination of its esports activities into a decentralized media space that can be expanded upon by Farcaster builders.\n\nFrom the social media POV, BLVKHVND can aggregate all of its content in a digestible format for fans and curious folk alike to interact with our community onchain that we are unable to build in traditional channels like Twitter. Moreover, Twitter has completely changed how engagement works, further pushing us away from the people we desperately need to connect to. \n\n### What is being built? \nBLVKHVND is building a product called “HVNDCAST” combined with a launch strategy to take advantage of BLVKHVND’s participation in the ALGS Playoffs LAN, a $1m international tournament playoff event for Apex Legends.\n\n **HVNDCAST Product**\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreihryf2rljaruzjpihtyo4hmloyodiftf2yssazpimfpvnnk2lsq3i)\n\n**The purpose**: aggregate all competitive activity of BLVKHVND (and eventually any other esports or sports DAO) on top of the FC protocol. \n\n**Reason**: Most HVND members don’t use discord to keep up with our competitive progress nor is Twitter the best place to keep our community informed. In order to build retention within our own community and grow support from others, we needed to find a way to aggregate our content in an environment that is digestible, easy to use, and scalable for other communities to take advantage of. \n\nWith HVNDCAST, we can create conversation around all of our content, keep folks interested in what we compete in, and how they can express their support onchain. Built on FC protocol. Experience esports together. Show support with native NFTs. Buy our native DAO token $acolyte, vote on props in AC, new team added to HC, watch team, mint a moment 🔄\n\n**Launch Criteria**:\n\nContent: \n\n- Must be able to pull streams + clips from twitch, kick, hypeshot\n- Must be able to comment on content\n-Must be able to display tournament information (scores, brackets, placements, etc)\n\nUX: \n- Must be able to connect app to Warpcast\n- Must be able to share links and content \n\nData:\n- Must be able to pull / scrape info from Liquipedia, Battlefy (for game info)\n\n**Deadline**: Jul 10, 2023\n\n### “Feelin Purple” Campaign\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreifrb7fbnw3niofqpiyz5hqvv4waof2z3fl25vmdmlb6blzr5gluym)\n\n**Stage**\nUtilizing an all purple jersey, we will have our Apex Legends team mention Purple DAO in their media day interviews during the ALGS Global Playoffs this July. In addition, our team will play in the purple jersey throughout the entire competition as the broadcast and other media captures gameplay. With the launch of HVNDCAST, fans will be able to directly connect the dots between the purple jersey and the FC protocol increasing their chances of joining the ecosystem.\n\n[purpleKIT.mp4 ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ggZf9ILJ3QQ6lCIeVb-EW99XnYKuOHgx/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**Success Criteria**: The campaign is considered successful if we:\n\n- bring the BLVKHVND community to FC through HVNDCAST; [at least 100 members]\n- bringing Apex fans to FC and chat about the Playoffs event; [at least 25 fans]\n- PurpleDAO members show their support for BLVKHVND; \n     - Purple members joining BLVKHVND (participating in auction)\n     - Farcaster members joining BLVKHVND (participating in auction)\n\n\n**About ALGS Playoffs**\n\nThe ALGS global playoffs is the second massive in-person (LAN) competitive esport event for the Apex Legends season. As a result, players from all over the world converge in London to compete for their share of $1M and to see which region is the strongest. High placement in this tournament automatically sends those teams to compete for a $3M Global Championship later in the year. For BLVKHVND, we earned our spot to play in the playoffs and have a very high chance of reaching top 10 (out of the top 40 teams in the world) or greater.\n\n***The Global Playoffs has over 540k+ peak viewers, 205k average across 5 days***.\n\n\n*Our team exists because of a DAO proposal and vote: https://twitter.com/blvkhvnd_bot/status/1633684001343909888?s=20 , now we have the opportunity to compete on an international stage. We are witnessing magic happen in real time.*\n\n### How did this come about?\n\nTimeline of discussion on Farcaster.

      "title": "FarCon Crowdfund Contribution of 1 ETH from Purple",
      "content": "TL;DR\nFarCon is an experiential public good that facilitates a special kind of physical connection; to support and proliferate the digital ecosystem known as Farcaster.\n\nOverview\n\nAs a thriving and forward-looking DAO, Purple has demonstrated the potential of Nouns Builder and significantly contributed to the growth of the Nounish ecosystem. Collaborating with the Farcaster community, Purple has been working with developers and builders in the ecosystem. Purple has also proven its ability to generate attention and capital for its goals, thanks to the quality of its members.\n\nTo further strengthen the Farcaster ecosystem on which Purple is built, we propose a grant to partially fund a first of its kind Farcaster Conference (FarCon), which will bring Farcaster users together for a weekend of conversation, hacking, and interpersonal connection focused problem-solving of network level problems within the Farcaster Community. This event will strengthen the bonds between Casters, reinforce Purple's influence and legitimacy, and showcase Farcaster as a vibrant and  friendly community that extends well beyond a digital interface. The Farcaster meetup organized during EthDenver has been instrumental in strengthening the community. The upcoming FarCon event will further establish it as a regular happening.\n\nThe Warpcast team has decided to match Purple's contribution to the first FarCon event. Therefore, the proposed transaction for this proposal is requesting 1 ETH from the treasury of Purple.\n\nObjectives\n\nFacilitate networking, collaboration, and learning among Farcaster community members.\nEncourage innovation and problem-solving from within the Farcaster ecosystem.\nAttract talented individuals to Farcaster and Purple DAO, expanding our network of contributors and enthusiasts.\nShowcase the potential of Nouns Builder and Purple DAO's commitment to the growth of the Nounish ecosystem.\nDemonstrate of Proof of Concept Digital + Physical event anchored in the Farcaster community\n\nPlan of Action\nDevelop conference agenda, including workshops, talks, and hackathon challenges related to the crypto, Web3, and Nounish ecosystems to include the physical conference dates, as well as in the week leading up to FarCon\nOrganize and coordinate logistics for the conference, including venue, registration, and marketing efforts.\nLaunch a promotional campaign for the conference, leveraging Purple DAO's network and media connections, including podcast appearances, newsletters, and blog posts.\nEngage the Purple DAO community in attending, volunteering, and participating in conference activities.\nDocument and share conference outcomes and successes on Farcaster, Purple DAO, and other relevant platforms to promote further offline meetups and contributions to the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nNote: Substantial progress is already underway in all of these efforts and over 60 Farcasters have minted their tickets already.\n\nBudget\n\nThe 1 ETH funding will be allocated towards conference venue, logistics, and support costs.\n\nExpected Outcomes\n\nStrengthened connections among Farcaster community members, fostering collaboration and innovation.\nIncreased engagement within Farcaster and Purple by attracting intellectuals and talented individuals.\nEnhanced Farcaster and Purple’s influence on network stewardship and decentralized organization of people.\nEstablished Purple DAO as a leader in decentralized, permissionless, and censorship-resistant economies, software development, and community design.\n\nA vote in favor of this proposal signifies support for community growth, intellectual advancement, and the continued progress of Farcaster and Purple. \n\nYour support will empower us to create an environment where Farcaster and Purple's values can flourish and reach far beyond our growing corner of the crypto universe 🫡\n\nTo follow along with current and future progress towards these objectives, please visit https://farcon.xyz/ ",

      "content": "**tl;dr:** A Prop House round with five 1 ETH prizes to encourage popular Twitter bot developers to port their infrastructure to Farcaster\n\n**Background**\n\nOn April 29th, Twitter is deprecating their Search and Account Activity API. This will affect hobby and commercial developers who rely on the API to read content from Twitter’s database. Farcaster Hubs are now launched, which enable broad access to data from the Farcaster protocol. Purple should support developers in their migration efforts and use this opportunity to educate developers about the benefits of an open and decentralized social media protocol. \n\n**Timeline**\n\n- 2 weeks for submissions (starting from May ~5 or whenever the Prop House is ready, whichever is sooner)\n- 1 week for voting (starting from May ~19 or whenever submissions end, whichever is sooner)\n\n**Rewards**\n\n- 5 winners at 1 ETH each\n\n**Requirement**\n\nDevelopers must be currently operating a Twitter bot. Preference should be given to bots that provide useful, amusing, or engaging content. \n\n**Voting Guidelines**\n\nNo self-dealing or conflicts of interest: Purple holders should refrain from voting on sending funds to wallets where any portion of those funds is expected to flow to them, their projects, or anyone they have a close personal or economic relationship with.\n\n**Note**\n\nIf two projects have received the same number of votes, the one submitted earlier will rank higher.",

      "content": "### tl;dr\n\n**This proposal funds the sponsorship of the Forefront Newsletter for the month of May 2023 for 1 ETH.** This includes a Purple banner at the top of every Newsletter edition (email and website), twice a week Twitter and Farcaster features, and presence on Forefront Signal for the month of May.\n\n### description\n\nOver the last three years, Forefront has built the home of tokenized communities and social crypto. The Forefront Newsletter (weekly) and Signal (daily) are premier destinations for the highest signal news and insights at the frontier of communities and social crypto. Forefront also builds [Terminal](terminal.co), which is an in-depth dashboard for DAO metrics including Purple and other nounish DAOs.\n\nWe believe that potential Purple members are abundant in the Forefront audience, and that sponsoring the newsletter would be effective proliferation for the DAO.\n\n### newsletter stats\n\n- **Active subscribers:** ~10,000\n- **Email open rate:** ~45%\n- **CTR:** 8%\n- **Top reader origins:** US, UK, Canada, EU\n- **Audience profile:** Forefront has always focused on social crypto, specifically social tokens and tokenized communities (i.e. Nounish DAOs). Our audience ranges in expertise, from founders of some of the biggest companies in the space to explorers who are getting their first doses of web3 knowledge from FF. The through-line is a strong interest in tokens, DAOs, and their impacts on creators and communities.\n- **Frequency:** once a week (on Monday mornings PT)\n- **Ads per issue:** 1 sponsor (this would be Purple)\n\nHere is an example of a sponsorship banner from [Primitives](https://primitives.xyz/?ForefrontN2=true), the April sponsor:\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeicuthfqmcx5yh7d2nj5jesyackaa6wlrzqpl5pnono33r4kgd7vnu)\n\nOur team would develop custom copy and images for Purple’s banner, with potential changes week-to-week based on community feedback. *Copy would include highlights from the Purple community from the previous week, spotlighting the incredible work happening throughout the ecosystem.*\n\n### budget\nSponsorship of the Forefront Newsletter is 1 ETH per month. This proposal would send 1 ETH directly to the Forefront DAO Treasury.\n",

      "title": "Removing the Founder Allocation for the Founder multisig",
      "content": "## tldr;\n\nThis Proposal removes the Founder allocation for 0x06B59d0b6AdCc6A5Dc63553782750dc0b41266a3 by setting the 10% allocation to 0%. The signers of this multisig are ccarella.eth, osama.eth, evaav.eth and jihad.eth.\n\nIt doest not effect the 10% allocation for farcaster.eth or the 1% allocation to Nouns.\n\n## Why do Nounish DAOs have Founder Allocations\n\nThere are 2 reasons to start a Nounish DAO with a Founder Allocation; rewarding activation energy and guiding the community.\n\n**Rewarding Activation Energy**\n\nActivation energy can be thought of as the effort, resources, and momentum needed to initiate and sustain the growth of the DAO. This term is borrowed from chemistry, where it refers to the minimum energy required for a chemical reaction to occur. Similarly, in the context of Nounish DAOs, activation energy refers to the critical threshold that must be overcome to successfully establish a community and create engagement among its members. Make no mistake; this is work. For Purple it included rallying the pre-launch community, keeping everyone aligned, deploying the smart contracts, evangelizing the DAO, educating people on the outside on how Nounish DAOs work, educating people on the inside on how Nounish DAOs work, getting the first half dozen props going and motivating our first Prop House.\n\nFounder Allocations help align the incentives around the Activation Energy required.\n\n**Guiding the Community**\n\nEarly in the lifecycle of the DAO, Activation Energy can be impeded by not having enough members or votes to make things happen or even worse, having early members with bad or misguided intentions. In the case of Purple, the Founders as individuals did not win an Auction into Token #6 and Token #8 and without the Founder allocation could not help direct the early days of the DAO. Had the demand drove the auction price of 10x, it potentially would have been much longer before the Founders could participate. \n\nBeyond impedance to Activation Energy, Founder Allocation allows a projects Founders to guide the community towards the initial vision. While Member of Purple have been highly aligned since Day 1, you can see this guidance happening at Nouns where 650+ days in, DAO members look towards the Founders (Nounders) to see how they vote on a Proposal. This helps hold together a consistent vision for the DAO amongst a divergent membership. Part of that \"Guiding\" also includes a strong influence on how the Treasury is used. Zora used their Founder Allocation to vote against a Proposal with a large ETH ask, that would have otherwise passed, that they felt was not related to the Nouns Builder Protocol or ecosystem.\n\n## Why is Purple removing the Founder Allocation\n\n**Activation Energy**\n\nIncentives for the Activation Energy are behind us. The Purple flywheel is in motion. We are decentralized. The community is in complete control of the energy required to keep our perpetual motion machine moving.\n\n**Guiding the Community**\n\nThis has never been a real issue for us. The DAO was highly aligned since the first token as a result of our unique vision to support a protocol that all of our Members love. 175+ tokens in and we feel comfortable with the guiding hand of the DAO's members.\n\n## What happens to the tokens in the Founder Multi-sig?\n\nWe will hold them for a while as the community develops. Our longer term plan is to give them out on a merit basis at the discretion of the Founder Multi-sig. \n\n## Summary\n\nRemove the Founder allocation for 0x06B59d0b6AdCc6A5Dc63553782750dc0b41266a3, the Founders Multi-sig (ccarella.eth, osama.eth, evaav.eth and jihad.eth)\n\n",

      "content": "Hey Purple Casters!\n\nI've been building out a proof of concept for tipping on top of Farcaster. I have more ideas on what I'd like to build out and curious if the Purple Fam would see this as something that you'd like to help fund.\n\nFirst I'll explain what you can do with TipCast already and then share what I'd like to build next on top of it.\n\n## Current Version\n\nCurrently with TipCast, a profile page for every caster is created. Then you can simply tip a user on the polygon network and the tip goes directly to their connected/verified wallet. You have to sign transactions and complete a couple steps to make this happen.\n\nYou can go check out the first version here: [https://tipcast.xyz](https://tipcast.xyz/) You can see the tips that people have already been sending at the Gratitude Board. [https://www.tipcast.xyz/feed/tipper-board](https://www.tipcast.xyz/feed/tipper-board)\n\nI would more or less like to build out Dan's idea #26.\n\n![https://s3.amazonaws.com/charm.public/user-content/42c34249-7aae-43b5-a84f-90e5beaafef6/0e713036-8b6d-46b4-af2c-0c12c4f5983f/a9bf2ad1-ee54-497d-9925-28d84e37f738.png](https://s3.amazonaws.com/charm.public/user-content/42c34249-7aae-43b5-a84f-90e5beaafef6/0e713036-8b6d-46b4-af2c-0c12c4f5983f/a9bf2ad1-ee54-497d-9925-28d84e37f738.png)\n\n## To Build for this Proposal\n\nBelow are the items that I would build along with the estimated timeline:\n\n1. Smart Contract for tippers to deposit funds so that TipCast can tip Casters easily behind the scenes. (4 weeks to build). If I can get it to work, this may include smart wallets as well to abstract wallet complexity away from the user.\n2. Add functionality for tippers to be able to reply to a cast with \"@tip 20 cents\" (or some other amount) and the tipping would all happen behind the scenes on-chain. No transactions to approve. (1 week to build)\n3. Additions to the website client for seeing tipping feeds and info about who has been tipped. (1 week to build)\n4. TipCast api with api docs so that other Farcaster clients can easily add tipping ui within their app. (2 weeks to build)\n\nThis is the order that I would build these in. The plan is for this to be built on top of Polygon. I would like to support more chains in the future. The reason Polygon was chosen is because it has the cheapest fees (sub penny) for an Ethereum sidechain.\n\n## Why This?\n\nI believe these tipping features would help make Farcaster a delightful place and help support the community. Making it really easy to send micro transactions over Farcaster would give a way to encourage other Farcaster builders or creators.\n\n## Building in Public\n\nTo help share the process and keep myself accountable with the community, I will be creating behind the scenes videos of the building process and posting on PixelPool. I’ll also share in cast form on FC.\n\n## Funding Ask\n\n5 Eth to build out the plans above. This money would be used for my time to build out these features. And I want to be clear that currently TipCast wouldn't be built to make revenue, but that could change in the future if it makes sense to make TipCast even better for the community. I'm more or less just following the thread in front of me.\n\n## Proposed Transactions\n\n0x9FFfd1CA952faD6BE57b99b61a0E75c192F201c1 Transfer(value: 5.0 ETH)",

I would personally use it. \n\nAn early version of the proposal has also garnered 7 upvotes in a heat check on Purple's [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1038646236858822706/1038646237882220698/1090103068999303328)]\n\nHi everyone, [@pixel](https://warpcast.com/pixel) from Farcaster. I'm currently building Warpy: open-source, cc0 Farcaster datasets.\n\nThe goal: run two Python commands to have all historical Farcaster data. Useful if one wants to do research about Farcaster. Here's what I've done: [https://github.com/vinliao/warpy](https://github.com/vinliao/warpy). Anyone can just run python download.py to get all Farcaster datasets (~500k casts, ~10k users, more will be added).\n\nI've also plugged ChatGPT into these datasets, so anyone can do things like \"give me one random cast from user dwr\" or \"show me total cast and reactions last week\" and it'll spit out the answer. Really handy for those who dislike SQL (who doens't?).\n\nThe current state of the repo is very barebones. Roadmap: add Eth transactions data, add reactions data, have some kind of server so data freshness can be automated, data and schema versioning, and of course, plugging GPT-4 to it when it's available. Estimate: ~1mo to do all these.\n\nCurrent purple treasury: 42E, I'm asking for 3E. There are small server expenses I need to pay here and there, but mostly it'll be used to buy pizza, diet coke, and ChatGPT subscription.",

      "content": "### About\n\nA \"Droposal\" is a Proposal that when successfully voted on mints an NFT for sale. This means the DAO has the provenance or minter address. This is an NFT minted by Purple in collaboration with an artist. It is also typical to have a splits contract so that sales support both the DAO and the artist.\n\nHere is an example of [the first Nouns Droposal.](https://nouns.wtf/vote/190)\n\nThis Proposal is for Purple’s first Droposal in collaboration with artist and Farcaster, [ChrisCoCreated](https://warpcast.com/chriscocreated.).\n\n### The Details\n\nThe NFT is a Farcaster community artwork, minted by Purple with a 50/50 income split between Purple and the artist, ChrisCoCreated using a [Splits Contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0x6c5786D246700cB4635f2c29269606179b82433f/). It also Airdrops a Purple token on the artist, so that our collaborator becomes a DAO Member. It makes [ccarella.eth](https://warpcast.com/ccarella) the administrator on Zora for this artwork, enabling him to make any changes necessary, including updating the metadata to display the final artwork.\n\n### The Art\n\nThe artwork is a representation of the Farcaster Arch made out of the pfps of the most recent 1941 people who have made a cast. This is currently everyone who sent a cast in the last 7 days. The art will be a snapshot in time of the active Farcaster community and will be created at the time this Proposal is executed.\n\n### The Website\n\nAlong with the artwork there will be a dynamically updating website created by ChrisCoCreated showing the arch with the most recent 1941 casters.\n\n### The Transaction\n\n- Mint the NFT as a 7 day open edition for 0.027 ETH\n- Makes ccarella.eth the admin of the Zora contract for updates, including updating the metadata with the image created at Proposal execution.\n- Proceeds from the NFT go into this [Splits Contract](https://app.0xsplits.xyz/accounts/0x6c5786D246700cB4635f2c29269606179b82433f/) which then gives 50% to Purple & 50% of to ChrisCoCreated\n- Airdrops 1 Purple Token on ChrisCoCreated\n\n\n### A Representation of Artwork\n\nThe Artwork will be created using the most recent 1941 casters at the time the Proposal is executed. The image below is a reference of what it will look like.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Yt83fUU.jpg)\n\n\n### About ChrisCoCreated\n\nCommunity artist cocreating towards a more open, curious and playful web3.\nhttps://chriscocreated.xyz/\n\n**Artist Statement**\n\nI aim to be a Philosopher Builder; creating experiences to help us live truly and happily:\n\n- That are playful, open, curious, connected.\n- That nourish us and those we share this life with.\n- That build our mental wealth.\n- That are as concerned with the process and the experience as the outcome.\n- That are experimental, knowing that there is always something to be learned.\n- That are beautiful.\n- That create the conditions for joy and love and laughter.\n",

      "title": "PRPL 19 Cosponsor NYC NFT Meetup",
      "content": "## tldr;\nThis proposal funds the sponsorship of an [NFT NYC](https://nft.nyc) Farcaster Meetup. The meetup will be hosted in partnership with [OrangeDAO](https://www.orangedao.xyz), who has helped secure a location. The requested budget for this event is 0.8 ETH. \n\n## Description\nNFT NYC is one of the biggest events of the year. Being in the heart of one of the major hubs in crypto, NYC is a great location to meet and collaborate with other builders in the Ecosystem. NFT NYC also attracts non-Ethereum users which could be a great way to find newer members from different walks of life into the Farcaster ecosystem.\n\nIn order to proliferate awareness of the Farcaster protocol, we propose to hold a Farcaster meetup at the tail end  (April 15) of NFT NYC 2023.\n\n## Partnership\nOrangeDAO has been a great partner, and helped organize the ETHDenver Farcaster meetup because it was such a big success they've decided to partner with us again for this event as well. They've offered to use their location in Manhattan with some associated costs. \n\nOrange is a 1300+ member DAO, that primarily focuses on funding and supporting early-stage web3 startups. They are one of the most active DAOs on Farcaster (outside of Purple), showing an interest in the protocol and it's ecosystem.\n\nWith over 30 RSVPs, an [EventCaster page](https://www.eventcaster.xyz/events/81247dea-10d0-4181-9b34-fe74296fcef8) set up, [promoted on Farcaster](https://warpcast.com/tayyab/0x5dcecb), and a [dedicated Telegram group](https://t.me/c/1640651627/1797). We are already gaining traction for this meet up, and expect to get more as the date gets closer. \n\n## Budget\nWe've already secured a location thanks to OrangeDAO's generous offer to use their workspace. The following budget is an estimated breakdown:\n\n- Services Fees: $1000\n- $20 x 150 (estimated attendance): $3,000\n- **Total: $4,000**\n\nLuckily, we've already received a donation of 1 ETH from @osama, $1,250 from combined donations from @df, @j4ck, and @matt. \n\n$4,000 - ~$2950 (donations) = $1,050 remaining which approximates to about 0.62 ETH at proposal time. We are asking for 0.7 ETH to hedge against market volatility.\n\nThe funds will be allocated to a new Events multisig, which will reimburse event organizers upon proof-of-receipt. Reimbursements must take place within 90 days of the conclusion of ETHDenver.\n\nAll remaining funds (if any), will be sent back to the Purple treasury by the multisig.\n\n## Events Multsig\nA new 3 of 4 multisig has been created in anticipation of this proposal. All members have agreed to review and approve/deny reimbursement requests on behalf of the DAO. Approvals should take place in a timely manner.\nIf, for some unforeseen reason, a signer can not complete the duties outlined above, a replacement may be chosen by the remaining multisig signers. It's details are as follows:\n**Multisig:** eth:0xbCbe1A51A1583FbC3157dB7e5addCc2CF2255BF4\nSigners:\n- tayyab.eth\n- j4ck.eth\n- cryptpal.eth\n- mattkoch.eth\n",

      "content": "The emergence of AI-generated art has been a topic of discussion for several years now. While some consider it to be a remarkable technological advancement, others argue that the technology poses a significant threat to the art world. The threat of AI-generated art is ramping out of control, and it is crucial that we take action to ensure that this technology does not cause irreparable damage to the art world.\n\nOne of the most significant threats posed by AI-generated art is that it could lead to the devaluation of human creativity. For centuries, artists have been revered for their ability to create unique and meaningful works of art that resonate with viewers on a deep emotional level. However, with the advent of AI-generated art, it is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate between human and machine-generated art. This could lead to a situation where human creativity is no longer valued, and machines are considered to be just as capable of creating meaningful works of art as humans.\n\nAnother threat posed by AI-generated art is the potential for the technology to be used to create counterfeit works of art. With AI, it is possible to create highly realistic replicas of famous works of art, which could be used to defraud art collectors and dealers. This could have a devastating impact on the art world, leading to a loss of trust and confidence in the authenticity of works of art.\n\nFurthermore, the use of AI in art could also lead to the automation of the art industry, potentially leading to the displacement of artists and art professionals. If machines are capable of creating art, it is possible that they could eventually replace human artists, leading to widespread unemployment in the art world.\n\nTo combat the threat of AI-generated art, it is essential that we take action now. One way to do this is to ensure that artists are involved in the development of AI technology. By involving artists in the creation of AI algorithms, we can ensure that the technology is being used to enhance human creativity rather than replace it.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to establish clear guidelines and regulations around the use of AI in the art world. This could include requirements for labeling AI-generated art, so that viewers are aware that they are looking at a machine-generated work of art. It could also involve the establishment of legal protections for artists, ensuring that they are not replaced by machines in the art industry.\n\nIn conclusion, the threat of AI-generated art is ramping out of control, and it is imperative that we take action now to mitigate the potential damage to the art world. By involving artists in the development of AI technology, establishing clear guidelines and regulations around the use of AI in art, and providing legal protections for artists, we can ensure that AI technology is being used to enhance human creativity rather than replace it.\n\n**We must act now**. Elect 0xen.eth as a sole dictator to lead us towards the brighter future and use the Purple DAO funds to combat the AI threat to Farcaster art.\n\nVote today. Don't delay.",

      "content": "### Summary \n\nAsk for 5 ETH to fund Prop House Round 2, an open round with 5 winners to be awarded 1 ETH each\n\n### Background\n\nWe are witnessing a historical moment in Farcaster's history. With Sign in with Farcaster and Hubs launching soon, Farcaster builders will be able to permissionlessly create apps that are at feature parity with Merkle's Warpcast. An explosion of community apps is around the corner.\n\nTherefore it makes sense to launch a Prop House round now to build the energy of ETH Denver, Sign in & Hubs. Then ideally we follow up with a Quadratic Funding Round powered by Gitcoin and potentially a Hack Week (via separate proposals). For more context, see this Discord [thread](https://discord.com/channels/1038646236858822706/1087022635503853709/1087022666147450900).\n\n### Prop House Requirement\n\n- This is an open round, so any application in the Farcaster ecosystem is eligible. Both technical and non-technical projects are welcome.\n- A submission must have at least a working prototype to be qualified\n- (preferred, not-required) Open source and/or Public Goods\n\n### Timeline\n\nThis round will have 4 weeks from announcement to closed voting:\n\n1 week to advertise the rounds. Its on Prop House but submissions are not live. This will happen immediately after the proposal is passed (~March 27)\n\n2 weeks for submissions\n\n1 week for voting\n\n### Budget\n\n- Total budget: 5 ETH (5 winners at 1 ETH each)\n- Our current Treasury at time of posting is ~42 ETH.\n- Total budget is ~12% of current Treasury\n\n### Prop House Multisig\n\nWe are reusing the Small Grants Multisig created in [PRPL 4](https://www.alphacaster.xyz/dao/purple-publicgoods/vote/4).\n\nThe Small Grants Multisig is responsible for distributing funds to winners of Purple Prop House Rounds. Purple Members vote for the grant applications they wish to see funded and the Prop House Multisig must respect the outcome and quickly distribute funds to the winners.\n\nThe Multisig requires 3 out of 5 signers to complete a transaction. The signers are:\n\n- philm (eth:0x925aFeB19355E289ED1346EDE709633cA8788b25)\n- jpetrich (eth:0x09E6D38949644291179cfEa3ea263dc1F6A7C35e)\n- ccarella (eth:0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F)\n- Malcolm (eth:0x8B7D79a679c10bEd518fE905D764b4b7667f24de)\n- Matticus (eth:0x78d32460D0a53Ac2678e869Eb6b4f6bA9d2Ef360)\n\nThe Multisig address: (eth:0x3E2cd6cA1F18d27Fe1BBeB986914e98d5DD08BB0)\n\n### About Prop House\n\nProp House is a Nouns-funded public infra that allows DAOs to easily fund projects: https://prop.house/purple \n\nAnyone can submit projects (per round requirement) and DAO members will vote (no gas). Purple uses Prop Houses for small grants, where we set a budget and then lots of people apply for a small grant and token holders vote for the winners.",

      "content": "**TLDR\n**\nIn summary, this aims to finance a dedicated developer for the Farcaster community ecosystem by focusing on four key end-user projects, offering a unified bootstrap template set, and maintaining a bi-weekly budget tracked and refundable through the Juicebox DAO. Our ultimate objective is to enhance and expand the open-source environment on Farcaster.\n\nProblem Discover & Definition\n\nWhy does it matter?\n\nThe growth, involvement, and innovation of the Farcaster Ecosystem depend on the development of new tools and applications, not only by experienced developers but by people who offer fresh perspectives on how to utilize the service. Enabling these people creates more engaged users, new products, fresh perspectives, and an extended base of agents of invite.\n\nWhat are the objectives?\n\nUsers\n\nProvide 4+ end-user open-source tools for the Farcaster community, enabling users to interact with the protocol in novel ways.\n\nfollow tracking\n\nprovides context to the otherwise numeric result, which drives quality and understanding.\n\ncast line interface\n\nprovides compute power behind the cast line, enabling a more powerful cast experience.\n\ncast scheduling\n\nenables consistent activity and utilization of peak activity periods.\n\ncommand line interface package\n\nincreases access and usage, a continuously requested product.\n\nDevelopers\n\nCreate a cohesive open-source set of templates for developers to bootstrap their applications.\n\nWeb app with feed and filtering\n\nShowcase many features and provide a base for builders to start from.\n\nFarcaster login integration\n\nTo simplify the process of understanding auth, allowing a deeper focus on the end product.\n\nTo ensure new developers are utilizing a safe implementation and secure key storage.\n\nHubble implementation and deployment\n\nProvide simple deployment instructions, listed as a goal in the Hubble repository.\n\nUpdate developer documentation across repositories.\n\nThe need for better docs is noted in the Hubble repository and Farcaster-py repository.\n\nPurple\n\nTo pilot the establishment of a dedicated builder program within the Farcaster ecosystem.\n\nOn-demand builder, as needed, when needed.\n\nExternal publications about Farcaster.\n\nI am a 2-time award-winning author on hackernoon with ~600 views/ article.\n\nEstablishing oversight for a future builder program.\n\nSupport the project-oriented prop house.\n\nWhy are we doing this?\n\nIncrease the number of native Farcaster and internal warpcast tools vs. external clients.\n\nTo enable new developers as engaged community members with a strong base of support.\n\nTo provide a cohesive narrative around templates and documentation across the ecosystem.\n\nProvisioning the simplest, cheapest, immediate onramp to complex implementations (Hubble).\n\nTo take action on the same issues I faced as a new builder in the ecosystem.\n\nHow can Purple oversee this?\n\nWe're breaking new ground with this- my background as a founder allows me to stay focused in turbulent environments with or without oversight. My intention is to work closely with the DAO community to set deadlines, change priorities, and create a framework that can be used in the future.\n\n I am bringing a founder's perspective and energy to the program. That means I'm working full time++, weekends, and excited by the opportunity. I encourage Purple to work on forming its own oversight initiatives as the proposal progresses. I've also set the funding mechanism up through Juicebox DAO, which allows purple to vote to revoke funding should progress stagnate.\n\nSuperficial metrics can be tracked when possible, such as article reads, template integrations, builders supported, templates created, and lines of documentation rewritten. \n\nLastly, I am providing four clearly scoped end-user projects, including open-sourcing, extending the ditti cast-line-interface, rebuilding ditti.xyz follow tracking, building an extendable cast-scheduling CMS, and creating a command-line interface for viewing and casting to the Farcaster protocol from a terminal.\n\nI would also like to engage the Farcaster community by scheduling bi-weekly or monthly conversations on the unlonely.app, which has long been an active part of the community.\n\nThe Builder (Alex Paden)\n\nWhat is your familiarity with crypto as a builder & user?\n\nI first became involved with Bitcoin in 2012 when I began using it for game item sales in Minecraft Factions. In 2016, I started the payment processor and e-commerce builder rocketr.net with anonymous internet friends, which bridged the gap between web2 and web3 payment options in pre-NFT digital goods commerce. I believe crypto provided the world with privacy and the internet’s rule of law. I am the 533 member of Farcaster, discovered it on my own accord, and have been active since (see farcaster.network).\n\nHow would you identify yourself?\n\nI’m a founder, generally speaking. I care about engineering, product, and organization. Since taking on my second startup as a solo founder, I have put a lot of emphasis on knowledge and experience across the board.\n\nWhat are you currently working on?\n\nRecently I’ve spent the last month or so building out a farcaster bot that acts like a CLI and handles commands in a slightly more product-focused way. For example, @ditti replies to the parent of a thread when translating or threading it, rather than the bottommost part. I'm currently enabling the automatic text-to-image code to save a user's font preference with \"@ditti save --font Roboto.\" That means GPT responses that are beyond the cast size limit are automatically converted using your own font choice.\n\nI’ve also been building a lot of automation tools, follow by friends’ activity, holdings, etc. Those are paired with a social CMS I’m working on at ditti.xyz for follow-tracking and post-scheduling. I’m still planning my next startup, which is currently oriented around a reputation for Online Identity. I’d like to launch that on Farcaster eventually.\n\nFunding Request\n\nI'm requesting funding of 6.9 Ξ to cover the 3-month pilot program, which includes:\n\n6 Ξ for my full-time salary (2.0 Ξ per month, 50+ hours/week)\n\n0.9 Ξ for miscellaneous expenses, such as design, testing, database, compute, and security\n\nDrafted Timeline\n\n3 months = 13 weeks\n\nSuggested that the projects are scoped to 1-2 week timeframes, with the responsibility of purple to engage in discussion for next priorities, and defunding if the timeframes are continuously broken. Subject to change at builder or purple discretion.\n\nWeek 0: Updating ditti bot for open-source, adding newly planned commands and user customization.\n\nWeek 1 & 2: Creating a safe and simple template (python and/or ts) for the new Farcaster login, working on documentation for said system. Simple cast scheduling project.\n\nWeek 3: open to builder discretion\n\nWeek 4 & 5: Rebuilding follow-tracking, include cast-scheduling with farcaster auth integration, preparation for open-source. ditti.xyz CMS\n\nWeek 6: Hubble deployment, simplest solution, simple usage.\n\nWeek 7: open to builder discretion\n\nWeek 8, 9, & 10: Custom command line interface (ditticast, open-source)\n\nWeek 11 & 12: open to builder discretion\n\n**Submitter's note:** Kmac here. If passed the payout would go into a juicebox project https://juicebox.money/@shoni IF at at anytime during the next three months Purple is unsatisfied with the work product we may redeem/claim unused funds. This experiment is setup with 100% redemption rate, two week funding cycles (think pay periods), and a 3 day delay for config changes should Purple wish to 'rage' quit.",

      "content": "For the past two months, Purple has been publishing ‘This Week in Farcaster,’ a weekly roundup of everything happening in the Farcaster ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal funds production of This Week in Farcaster through Q2.\n\nSpecifically, this proposal funds the following editions of This Week in Farcaster:\n\n- April 1\n- April 8\n- April 15\n- April 22\n- April 29\n- May 6\n- May 13\n- May 20\n- (May 27 skipped for Memorial Day Weekend)\n- June 3\n- June 10\n- June 17\n- June 24\n\nThis proposal is setup to transfer the funds directly to davisshaver.eth (a.k.a. the proposal author), who has been producing the newsletter since it began earlier this year. The typical newsletter takes 3-4 hours of production time and does require a significant amount of cultural/technical context to write in a manner that is accessible and accurate to users of varying technical ability and background.\n\nAs part of this proposal, davisshaver.eth would commit to either producing the newsletter himself or using the funds to hire a freelance web3-knowledgable journalist/Farcaster user to do it. davisshaver.eth also commits to actively seeking this freelance help, with the goal of reducing the ‘bus factor’ for This Week in Farcaster, which currently depends on a single person. In the event that a freelancer is identified, davisshaver.eth would share details with the DAO, as well as inviting the freelancer to join Discord and providing ongoing support to the freelancer to help them be successful in the role.\n\nAs part of this proposal, davisshaver.eth commits to transparency with the DAO regarding how the newsletter is being produced, as well as its engagement metrics with the community (subscriber count, Google Analytics pageviews, etc). davisshaver.eth also commits to working with the DAO on any potential tip jar, sponsorships, or other funding streams to ensure that the revenue is used an appropriate way, e.g. underwriting additional coverage/journalism for This Week in Farcaster and not for self-gain.\n\nAs has been previously stated to the DAO, davisshaver.eth makes no ownership claims to This Week in Farcaster and believes it to be the DAO’s IP. However, davisshaver.eth does take full responsibility for ensuring the newsletter meets journalistic standards and would serve as de facto publisher of the newsletter even if a freelancer is identified for content production.\n\nIn the event that davisshaver.eth cannot fulfill the commitments due to illness, act of God, or other reason, the funds would be returned by davisshaver.eth to the DAO multisig on a pro-rated basis depending on the percentage of newsletters completed and published as per the proposal.",

      "content": "<h1>tldr;</h1><p>This proposal funds the sponsorship of an <a href=\"https://www.ethdenver.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ETHDenver</a> Farcaster meetup. The meetup will be hosted in partnership with <a href=\"https://www.orangedao.xyz/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OrangeDAO</a>, who has agreed to split costs 50/50. The requested budget for this event is 3.6 ETH.</p><h1>Description</h1><p>ETHDenver is the largest and longest running Ethereum conference. It commands an extraordinary amount of attention within the Ethereum community, as well as drawing builders from around the globe to participate in the <a href=\"https://www.ethdenver.com/buidlweek\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">annual buildathon</a>.</p><p>In order to proliferate awareness of the Farcaster protocol, we propose to hold a Farcaster meetup during the core event (Mar 2-5) of ETHDenver 2023.</p><h1>Partnership</h1><p>Due to inflated costs, and a preference to not \"split\" the Farcaster audience, we propose holding the event in partnership with OrangeDAO. Orange is a 1300+ member DAO, that primarily focuses on funding and supporting early-stage web3 startups. They are one of the most active DAOs on Farcaster (outside of Purple), showing an interest in the protocol and it's ecosystem.</p><p>Orange has already begun marketing for a Farcaster meetup, primarily on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CryptpalSingh/status/1621266648698347520?s=20\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and in the <a href=\"https://t.me/+oEYe-c7xoPw2YjIx\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ETHDenver Telegram group</a>. With over 80 RSVPs and growing fast, this may be the largest FC meetup to date!</p><p>Purple and Orange will both be cosponsors of the event, and will be splitting costs 50/50 for the event venue, food &amp; beverage, and entertainment.</p><h1>Budget</h1><p>The following is an <strong><u>estimated</u></strong> budget breakdown, based on a number of venue quotes.</p><ul><li>Room rental: $500</li><li>Beverage minimum: $3500</li><li>Food minimum: $2500</li><li>Service fees: $1000</li><li><strong>Total: $7500</strong></li></ul><p>These prices are variable depending on the number of attendees. In order not to restrict the natural growth of the event, we are targeting a maximum event cost of $10,000 USD. Purple's obligation, in the worst case, would be $5,000 or ~3.3 ETH at proposal time. 0.3 additional ETH is requested to hedge against current market volatility.</p><p>The funds will be allocated to a new Events multisig, which will reimburse event organizers upon proof-of-receipt. Reimbursements must take place within 90 days of the conclusion of ETHDenver.</p><p>All remaining funds (if any), will be sent back to the Purple treasury by the multisig.</p><h1>Events Multisig</h1><p>A new 3 of 5 multisig has been created in anticipation of this proposal. All members have agreed to review and approve/deny reimbursement requests on behalf of the DAO. Approvals should take place in a timely manner.</p><p>If, for some unforeseen reason, a signer can not complete the duties outlined above, a replacement may be chosen by the remaining multisig signers. It's details are as follows:</p><p><strong>Multisig: </strong><a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0x2ABd6A529a87481bF96a8bd8d11Caf08aab58AD2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">eth:0x2ABd6A529a87481bF96a8bd8d11Caf08aab58AD2</a></p><p><strong>Signers:</strong></p><ul><li>maxpetretta.eth (eth:0x0a2F3020D266A54Fa8F0f72fd448969f74602222)</li><li>billzh.eth (eth:0xD1EAeFBeFFD4106A1A166CD26a1Fe23140D6a42e)</li><li>scottrepreneur.eth (eth:0x68d36DcBDD7Bbf206e27134F28103abE7cf972df)</li><li>brittkim (eth:0x345ab03602369dD0b443B9B0A5dF54DB7BfF708B)</li><li>thethriller.eth (eth:0xA9fA105CC800137B8BC9E7bD34d26460E1E77b9A)</li></ul>",

Merkle's <a href=\"https://farcasterxyz.notion.site/Roadmap-6487c599a29549a684ed49b370960ec5\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap</a> indicates that the first release will be in Jan 2023.</p><p>With @v <a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">publicly</a> asking for community contributions on some of the Hub <a href=\"https://github.com/farcasterxyz/hub/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22help+wanted%22\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">issues</a>, now is a great time for Purple to support developers and help accelerate Hub's development. </p><p>This proposal asks for 4 ETH to do a funding rounding specifically targeting the Hub issues. An issue will get rewarded 0.2 - 0.5 ETH depending on its impact (see details in the section below). </p><p>It also suggests leveraging the Multisig used in Prop House <a href=\"https://nouns.build/dao/0xa45662638e9f3bbb7a6fecb4b17853b7ba0f3a60/vote/0x6b25d04847936c3628cf5c8d207496a8b8874c07f79075954d641ea206507ac4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Round 1</a> to speed up the process so that developers will get notified ASAP and can work on issues during the holidays if they want.</p><h1>Fund Hub issues</h1><p>This proposal suggests funding Hub issues following the steps below. The total payout for all issues involved will not exceed 4 ETH.</p><p>Step 1: When an issue is solved by anyone outside of Merkle Manufactory, 0.2 ETH will be rewarded to the developer(s) who get their PR successfully merged. They need to manually claim the reward before getting paid (process defined below)</p><p>Step 2: After the first version of Hub gets shipped, Purple will ask @v and the rest of Merkle team to pick some high-impact issues (out of all issues rewarded in step 1) and rank them. Purple will then give out an additional 0.3 ETH for each, starting from the highest ranked issue, until the funding runs out.</p><p>Step 3: Any remaining funds after step 2 will be returned to the Treasury.</p><p><br></p><p>Note:</p><ol><li>An issue is only eligible for funding if its PR is merged after @v makes the <a href=\"about:blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">cast</a> (i.e. Wed, Dec 21 2022 4:59pm GMT) but no later than 90 days after this proposal passes</li><li>There is no restriction on the type of the issue or when it was created</li><li>If the funding runs out in step 1 (i.e. 20 issues get resolved by non-Merkle developers), the process will automatically terminate</li></ol><h3>Process to claim rewards</h3><p>After an issue is solved and corresponding PR merged, the author of the PR should do the following to claim rewards</p><p>Step 1: Create a Github gist that includes your FC handle &amp; link to the merged PR </p><p>Step 2: Make a cast with the gist and mention @purple. Also include your preferred Ethereum address to receive the fund (if no address provided, Purple will just use your Farcaster connected address)</p><h1>Reuse Prop House Multisig for speed</h1><p>In the interest of time, it is suggested that we re-use the Multisig created for Prop House <a href=\"https://nouns.build/dao/0xa45662638e9f3bbb7a6fecb4b17853b7ba0f3a60/vote/0x6b25d04847936c3628cf5c8d207496a8b8874c07f79075954d641ea206507ac4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Round 1</a>.

This gives DAOs the ability to add, modify and remove founders shares via proposal.</p><p>With this new feature DAO creators will have the ability to modify any errors that may have been caused at DAO deployment.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Upgrade Visibility</h3><p>In V1.1, each smart contract of a DAO now has an explicit version attached. This means that members and developers will be able easily understand which protocol implementation a DAO is utilizing at any given time.</p><p>This will also make it easier for future upgrades that are in development: including <em>airdrops</em> and <em>custom metadata renderers</em>.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Proposal Spam Fix</h3><p>Proposal submission to a DAO has an incorrectly implemented check which can allow for spam proposals to be submitted to a DAO. In V1.1 it works as expected.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Auction Improvements</h3><p>Improved bid handling and edge case management in the Auction House contracts.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Author</h3><p>This upgrade has been developed and proposed by <strong>Zora</strong> (<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xd1d1d4e36117ab794ec5d4c78cbd3a8904e691d0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 122, 183); background-color: transparent;\">zora.eth</a>)</p>",

      "content": "<h2>Description</h2><p>This is a Proposal to create a Prop House Multisig and fund it with 5 ETH to start Purple’s first Prop House round.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Prop House Multisig</h3><p>The Prop House Multisig is responsible for distributing funds to winners of Purple Prop House Rounds. Purple Members vote for the grant applications they wish to see funded and the Prop House Multisig must respect the outcome and quickly distribute funds to the winners.</p><p>The Multisig requires 3 out of 5 signers to complete a transaction. The signers are:</p><ul><li> philm (eth:0x925aFeB19355E289ED1346EDE709633cA8788b25)</li><li>jpetrich (eth:0x09E6D38949644291179cfEa3ea263dc1F6A7C35e)</li><li>ccarella (eth:0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F)</li><li>Malcolm (eth:0x8B7D79a679c10bEd518fE905D764b4b7667f24de)</li><li>Matticus (eth:0x78d32460D0a53Ac2678e869Eb6b4f6bA9d2Ef360)</li></ul><h3><br></h3><h3>Prop House Round 1: Retroactive Gifts</h3><p>The first round consists of 5 ETH to be distributed as gifts for retroactive contributions to the Farcaster ecosystem. 5 submissions will be awarded 1 ETH each. </p><p>Retroactive gifts are a thank you to all of the developers and community members who have already been building things on Farcaster. Anyone with an Ethereum address can propose that their own project or someone else's be considered for a retroactive gift. To be eligible for this round, grant recipients must have performed work prior to the start date of the proposal; projects which have not yet started or proposals for future work are ineligible for retroactive funding.</p><p>Once the proposal period ends, a voting period will start where Purple holders may vote for the proposal they believe should get funded (1 Purple = 10 votes). Winners are simply those proposals which have the most votes.</p><p>If passed, the funds would be released from the Treasury and sent to the Prop House multisig. The Prop House multisig is responsible for distributing funds at the end of each round’s voting period to the winners.</p><p>For more information on Prop House, please visit <a href=\"https://prop.house.\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://prop.house.</a></p><h3><br></h3><h3>Budget</h3><ul><li>The total budget for this proposal is 5 ETH.</li><li>The current Treasury as of posting this proposal is 25 ETH.</li><li>The proposed funding for this Prop House is ~20% of the current Treasury.&nbsp;</li></ul>",
