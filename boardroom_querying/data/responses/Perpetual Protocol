      "content": "This proposal aims to allocate PERP to fully compensate all users who lost funds in Perp V1 by minting PERP. We propose for the PERP to start vesting linearly over 12 months (with a cap of 3.3% of circulating supply being released each month). Emissions will start on the next first of the month 4 months after the vote finishes. Minting is on Mainnet, and emissions are on Gnosis Chain (xDai).\n\nIt’s crucial to come to a solution that rings close to fair, especially for V1 users, as they were massive contributors to the early growth of Perp Protocol. It is also only right to have safety of user funds as the forefront of protocol’s mandates.\n\nVoting Options:\n\nProposal 1: Mint PERP and fully compensate everyone proportionally (A cap of 3.3% PERP tokens will be released each month)\n\nProposal 2: Support minting PERP tokens for V1 users but not this proposal\n\nProposal 3: Against minting PERP tokens for V1 users\n\n*the price of PERP will be a 7-day TWAP of the last week of every month which will be used to calculate the amount of PERP that should be minted to make all of V1 users whole each month\n\nTo check how much funds will be distributed to each user (Margin + unrealized PnL according using index price and slippage according to original k values.):\nhttps://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmW81zQScrCpPomxCttBmLgsqpsyuhviwk9zLHeKq7Mg6v",

      "title": "PERP Buyback to Support Affected v1 Users and Boost User Confidence",
      "content": "V1 was shut down May 15 and remaining funds sent to users . Under the winning option (op2) of the v1 sunsetting vote, most users were properly compensated. However, a group of users still took a major loss despite using low leverage. While it was clear that using v1 had risks, we feel it is only right to do something for these users, especially if an option exists that can benefit all Perp community members as well as having a far reaching implication for the entire Crypto community on its path to regain user confidence and reignite the excitement of DeFi! Please review the full proposal and place your vote!  \n\nFull proposal: https://gov.perp.fi/t/perp-buyback-to-support-affected-v1-users-and-boost-user-confidence-to-prepare-for-the-bull-run-of-perp/853\n\nShort Summary:\nThe proposal uses a portion of the treasury fee income to buy back PERP over the years to compensate affected v1 users.\n\nThe fund is coming from the treasury fee income, thus it will NOT affect the LPs/insurance fund/stake rewards.\n\nBenefits:\n* Regular monthly price boost to PERP.\n* Unclaimed PERP will be burnt to further boost PERP price\n* This tells the rest of the crypto community that Perpetual Protocol is indeed honoring its documentation to compensate affected users with PERP.\n* Adding tremendous credibility to the Perpetual Protocol platform.\n* Align interest of the affected users with PERP holders, so they can spread positive news rather than negatives.\n* Reinvigorate user confidence to both the Perpetual Protocol as well as the Crypto community as a whole.\n* The return of users confidence will likely result in further price increase of PERP.\n* The PERP price increase will likely prompt prospective investors on the side line to put more money to buy PERP (i.e. BULL run!)\n\nAll in all, this is a win-win solution to both PERP holders and the affected v1 users, and it could have a far reaching implication for the entire Crypto community on its path to regain user confidence and reignite the excitement of DeFi!.\n\nVote Options:\n\nOption A: Use 17.5% monthly treasury fee income to buy back PERP over the years to cover all op4>op2 users, for their op4-op2 amount.($3.59M), pro rata to compensation amount.\n\nOption B: Use 25% monthly treasury fee income to buy back PERP over the years to cover all remaining users who did not benefit from op2, for the amount of (MAX(all options) - op2). ($5.2M) , pro rata to compensation amount.\n\nOption C: Use 40% monthly treasury fee income to buy back PERP over the years to cover all remaining users with 100% full compensation. ($34.08M). Use even distribution among the affected addresses so that small size users get paid off faster in accordance to the spirit of op2.\n\nOption D: Do not compensate.\n",

The amount would be $100k in Perp. As well the imbursement for DAO members would be updated to the dollar amount in the original proposal.\n- Hold another election cycle starting from next month to potentially elect new sub DAO members for the token listing DAO. Members of the token listing sub DAO cannot be apart of a different sub DAO.\n- All pre-approved campaigns and listings will roll over to the new listing DAO committee.\n- Increasing the stipend size to be a fixed dollar amount ($520) for members and ($945) for the lead. The stipends would be paid out using a 30d TWAP for the price of PERP.\n- Having a Coordinape pool of 120 PERP that would be distributed amongst the token listing DAO monthly.",

We want to be from 30M daily average -> 300M daily average. To do this we are proposing unlocking 21M PERP over 3 key areas:\n\n1. Rewards: to incentivise more trading volume\n2. Partnerships: both strategic and bounties to continually help push the protocol forward\n3. Liquidity: providing liquidity on DEXes to ensure low slippage for future PERP holders\n\nFor further details of breakdowns and justifications please visit the url above.\n\n**Note: please read the full post as there is an amendment at the end to accomodate feedback from the community**",

Either has a governance proposal OR was voted in the top 5 from the previous vote\n\n### Options:\nThe following have had proposals in the governance forums:\n- DOT: https://gov.perp.fi/t/proposal-to-launch-dot-usdc-market/190/7\n- LINK: https://gov.perp.fi/t/proposal-to-launch-link-usdc-market/195/6\n\nThe following were the top voted in the previous round but not listed\n- UNI\n- AAVE\n- SNX\n\n### Exclusions\nThe following was excluded due to not being supported on Chainlink.
