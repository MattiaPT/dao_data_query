However, we are no longer focused on acquiring new users as we are getting ready for the launch of V2 beta, which the core team aims to release the Beta version around this month.\n\nThe V1 represents a non-negligible maintenance cost for its app (mostly), and unnecessary complexity in terms of integrations (all contracts’ interfaces will be obsolete).

We believe it would be a better use of resources to focus on releasing the V2 that comes with a modular architecture that doesn’t require custom pools for each different token (as they would be ERC-4626).

      "content": "## Summary:\n\nProposition for progressive reduction of V1 incentives\n\n## Context:\n\nAPWine protocol V1 is currently deployed with a set number of pools and incentivisation over its liquidity (directed through the gauges). Liquidity mining was voted initially to allow bootstrapping the liquidity on the different pools, currently following the distribution voted with APGP 14.\n\nWhile the V1 was a success as it brought the primitives designed from 0 to 1, bringing up to 25m$ TVL at some point, the V1 is no longer in the user acquisition phase, as we are getting closer to V2 (in the pipeline for almost a year now, with a private beta recently announced for before xmas). The V1 represents a non-negligible maintenance cost for its app (mostly), and unnecessary complexity in terms of integrations (changing contracts’ interfaces). As such, we are proposing a plan to progressively reduce incentives.\n\nA progressive reduction of those rewards would result in less dilution of the current holders, avoiding spending unnecessary/organic rewards for a rather low TVL atm. We believe this would represent a long term benefit for the protocol, also saving treasury reserves (which could eventually be used as incentives in the next iterations).\n\nThe distribution of LP rewards in its current state is a transition that is aiming to last until the next version of the protocol is released. The goal is to reduce token emission in the meantime while user acquisition is very low to keep as much dry powder as possible for the next release.\n\nNote: the incentivisation of the voting escrow voted with APGP 10 would not be affected by this proposal.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nWe are proposing a linear increase of the reduction factor:\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lLUM_GIa81s7g_AUGOaAmZrVML-Pmkd_zbUu4bdfx5YLkhzSFDiSPcdf2tqYgtMQbMJ9ee5Aw3pRD_vLeGNmR66d0e0NPLziJ4z1NHkUYSOAr_t0RVIJfNgDBMG5XHJjUvcHdWaD4mZMygxkKJTD33GTrIFyK1QB3OWbF8Q5qg-EGh39o4gSxedww5bF-w)\n(with x>33)\n\nWith an index of the reward weekly period (currently 34). Starting from cycle 36 (24.11.2022-1.12.2022), we will update our distribution formula to reduce the token distribution and progressively deprecate V1 liquidity while still maintaining a baseline for current LPs and stakeholders. The updated formula would results in the following:\n\n**Cycle 36 (24.11.2022-1.12.2022): 19’355 APW**\n\n**Cycle 37 (1.12.2022-8.12.2022): 16’762 APW**\n\n**Cycle 38 (8.12.2022-15.12.2022): 14’992 APW**\n\n**Cycle 39 (15.12.2022-22.12.2022): 13’686 APW**\n\netc.\n\n## Means\n\nDev & operational work\n\nUpdate the rewards formula of the rewarder",

The amount is decided with the following formula: (APWine Total TVL on DefiLlama / Kava Total TVL) * 4M KAVA distributed each month.\n\nThe amount of KAVA is calculated at the end of each month, and distributed in the following month.\n\nWith the current TVLs and token price, the current distribution would be 79715 KAVA, so 141900$/month at the time of writing but different parameters can modify these numbers such as the APWine total TVL, the Kava Network total TVL and the KAVA price.\n\nWe note that those numbers can fluctuate considerably depending on the mentioned variables.\n\n# Rationale:\n\nThis proposal is about the grant split.\n\n1) ⅔ of the monthly grant for DAO treasury\n- 25% of which would be allocated for LM\n- 70% of which would be allocated for treasury reserves (stablecoins, POL, strategics assets and bounties)\n- 5% for veAPW stakers\n2) ⅓ of the monthly grant allocated to team for operational costs (including additional devs, deployment/integrations & maintenance). The budget is set yearly as most of those elements cannot be efficiently engaged on a smaller time frame:\n- 250k$ for 2 dev (full stack + solidity)\n- 25k$ of participations for events & marketing\n- 140k$ of participations for audits et bounties\n- 5k$ for the infrastructure\n\nIf approved, a few sub proposals will be posted to vote about the DAO sub categories specifications.\n\n## Means\n\nDev & operational work\n\nGovernance work (Kava IBTs research and APIRs)\n\n## Technical implementation\n\nDeploy APWine on Kava\n\nDeploy a multisig to handle the grant (no gnosis yet)\n\nDeploy the Kava first IBTs pools\n\nHandle maintenance of the protocol on the network\n\nOthers implementation which will be mentioned in the sub proposals",

      "title": "APIP 5: Deploy APWine on Kava EVM co-chain to earn incentives from $750M Kava Rise Program",
      "content": "**Author:** TommyKavaLabs\n\nKava proposes deploying APWine on the Kava Network to earn a share of programatic developer incentives and establish itself as the derivatives layer protocol throughout the Cosmos/IBC ecosystem.\n\n**Summary:**\nKava will help drive value to the APW token and its users by extending derivatives market distribution to all major Cosmos blockchains and fueling growth with Kava’s $750M Kava Rise developer incentive which APWine should take a portion of with it’s usage.\n\n**Background:**\nKava’s mainnet has been live since early 2018 with no downtime or exploits , demonstrating proven resiliency and scalability via its native suite of top-tier DeFi products. In that time, Kava has onboarded 1.9M+ unique addresses and processed more than $2B in cross-chain transactions without issue.\n\nThe Kava Network has built on that foundation by merging the industry’s two most used permissionless ecosystems — Ethereum and Cosmos — in a single, developer-optimized Layer-1 network. Kava implements a unique co-chain architecture (like Avalanche c-chains) that allows for seamless interoperability between the two environments.\n\nKava’s Ethereum co-chain has successfully launched and the massive $750M Kava Rise developer incentive program is now LIVE.\n\n50+ Ethereum DeFi protocols like SushiSwap are now onboarding. This is an exciting opportunity for APWine to deploy onto Cosmos ecosystem and get a first mover advantage in:\n\n1.) TVL based programmatic incentives that will drive value to the APW token\n2.) Open APWine markets to all major Cosmos assets (ATOM, CRO, OSMO, etc) cementing APWine as the #1 derivatives protocol on Kava.\n\nKava is the most actively used and trusted network to integrate EVM support with the Cosmos SDK and IBC. Kava represents a proven entry point for APWine to the Cosmos ecosystem and its users. APWine launching on Kava gives APWine users access not only to Ethereum assets, but Cosmos and Binance Chain assets including.\n\nThe $KAVA token is listed on Binance, Kraken, Huobi Global, Upbit, and nearly every other major global exchange and wallet with strong liquidity and use in every major region in the world.\n\n**Incentives:**\nWith the Kava Rise Program, the Kava Network is implementing a unique and transparent on-chain incentive model for developers and ecosystem projects. The Kava Rise program will programmatically distribute $750M in Kava over 4 years to projects based on TVL.\n\nThe groundwork has already been set, all that’s left is for APWine to deploy onto Kava and start earning programmatic rewards every month which will accrue value to the APW holder and user.\n\nKava and APWine are aligned in together bringing APWine to Kava’s co-chain ecosystem and the Cosmos ecosystem broadly, with the goal of cementing APWine as the derivatives protocol of choice across the Cosmos and driving value to the APWine community for years to come.\n\n**Example Calculation:**\nDefiLlama shows APWine with ~5M in TVL on Ethereum. With an equivalent amount on Kava -\n\n$5m/~$300m total TVL is about 0.01667 of the total rewards.\n\nIf APWine maintain this proportion at the fully ramped amount of 4M Kava distributed per month, it would get ~66,667 Kava per month, or ~$139k/month USD at today’s prices\n\n**Means:**\nDev work \n\n**Technical implementations:**\nDeploy APWine on Kava Network\nDeploy initial IBTs after the next winelisting\n\n**Voting options:**\nYes\nNo\nAbstain",

      "content": "APIP-2, influenced by @Viras & @Dydymoon\n\nKey words:\n\nMultichain, increase userbase, increase tvl, increase latent value\n\nSummary:\n\nWhat network should Apwine deploy its instruments to next? It should deploy to a chain that will add to its TVL and valuation while also impacting the most users who would benefit from such tools that apwine provides.\n\nContext:\n\nThe community started asking for Apwine to deploy on new chains, and several different chains were mentioned. During the protocol’s launch, the team already stated the protocol will be multichain in the future so this vote is meant to signal a focus on resources and liquidity mining incentives for that next network. \n\nRationale:\n\nBy keeping Apwine only to polygon, kovan, and the Ethereum mainnet, we are reducing the platform’s exposure to users who would find the fixed income tools that Apwine provides very helpful. There is a motion that the community vote to select another evm chain to deploy onto that will further Apwine’s tvl and potential fee generation. A person should vote for a chain that carries great tvl already, has plenty of yield opportunities, and will have long-term value generation into the foreseeable future.\n\nThe included chains are those discussed in the forum to have the greatest potential for liquidity mining programs, TVL growth, and a large number of yield opportunities.\n\nThese are the chains everyone will be voting on, please read the forum for more details and see the poll to understand where the majority of thoughts and feelings lie.\n\nArbitrum (1.91 Billion TVL)\n\nOptimism (0.662 Billion TVL)\n\nAvalanche (2.57 Billion TVL)\n\nFantom (0.972 Billion TVL)\n\nGnosis Chain (0.173 Billion TVL)\n\nHarmony (0.083 Billion TVL)\n\nTVL's taken from https://defillama.com/chains & https://l2beat.com/\n\nIf your chain is not chosen do not fret, it is more likely than not that it will have another chance of being listed again in the future.",

      "content": "**Key words:**\nLiquidity Mining, Token Distribution, Updated Emission.\n\n**Summary:**\nUpdating the emission curve with a less aggressive schedule for distribution\n\n**Context:**\nAPWine tokenomics were brought to life during early 2021, they were based on the Curve model and we naturally thought of using a pretty similar emission schedule to Curve for the APW token.\n\nThe market and the expectations of the community changed a lot in the meantime. We’d like to make the emission fairer for the involved members of the community such as holders but especially stakers. It is also a plus for the long term growth of the project.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe protocol is currently distributing a big amount of tokens since the start of the liquidity mining on the protocol Here is a breakdown of the DAO expenses and the % of the supply represented:\n![image](ipfs://QmTMa7WRnoU7D8y9oa9MhFEB7ZSxn9nt4WYARyw6YsBz29)\n    \nThe DAO spent 6.46 + 0.62 = 7.08% of the total supply in liquidity mining in seven months, which represents 12.13% on a yearly basis at the current rate.\n\nAs you can see above, the liquidity mining is the biggest spending of the DAO, with an average of 141K APW/week. The initial idea was to be inspired from the following curve described here, while reducing the linear emission rate progressively. However, to ensure the sustainability of the protocol in the long terme,we want to update the rate to strictly follow the emission curve above, according to the formula proposed below: \n \n![image](ipfs://QmWLNs1rbP6yDpi7MWPdYMB6urHxjLqAyhfAfzsj5eKWk8)\n    \n![image](ipfs://QmQCsTzuwnaPEvEJzwbRiSpdxZPkW57BLNnU5WWKCD16CF)\n    \nThis is the results for the first 5 weeks of liquidity mining after the curve update :\nweek 1 : 120 051\nweek 2: 116 354\nweek 3: 112 979\nweek 4: 109 882\nweek 5: 107 027\n...\n\n**Means:**\nDev work\nNo budget required for this proposal.\n\n**Technical implementation:**\nThe distribution would happen the same as with the previous emission curve.\n\n**Voting options:**\nYes\nNo\nAbstain",

      "title": "APGP 13 : PAL x APW Token Swap",
      "content": "**Summary:**\nExpand the partnership between Paladin and APWine with a token swap used to increase the synergies between both protocols.\n\n**Context:**\nAPWine and Paladin partnership goes back to the first winelisting, as The palStkAAVE has been live since the launch of the protocol.\nA few months later, a proposal was submitted to add an extra liquidity mining in PAL.\n\nA token swap has been mentioned several times, especially on Paladin Forum on April 14th and again on May 1st. \n\n**Rationale:**\nPaladin is a decentralized, non-custodial governance ecosystem, which already includes 3 projects with different services:\n\nPaladin Lending which allows users to lend/borrow some voting power\nWarden is a boost marketplace for veTokens (CRV only for now). It’s a tool to calculate the additional boost needed and buy it to reach x2.5.\nWarden Quest is a gauge weight vote marketplace, rethinking the bribe model to increase sustainability.\n\nThe PAL is the governance token which controls the full ecosystem. Pal can have 3 different forms:\n\nPAL : Speculative level, no yield & no voting power.\nhPAL : PAL staked with a 10 days cooldown, yield + voting power 1:1 (1hPal = 1 vote)\nLocked hPAL : PAL locked from 1 week to 2 years, boosted yield + boosted voting power + access to the chest if locked long enough.\n50% of the fees collected through these dapps will go to Paladin DAO treasury to focus on building a self sustainable protocol. The other 50% will go to what’s currently called The Chest.\n\nThe full tokenomics is not over yet, but the initial proposition was to use these fees back in the Paladin ecosystem to allow locked hPal holders to use the different products with a discount or even for free depending on their stake. An alternative proposal was to only use half of the chest fees for this, and the other half to accumulate voting power that could be used by hPal lockers while the assets remain locked in the DAO to increase its value.\n\nThere is also a possibility to activate a profit sharing for hPal lockers in the future.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to swap 160000 APW for the equivalent in PAL for both projects to lock and acquire voting power. The swap will happen over a month after the end of the vote, with a 1 week TWAP price for the 4 tranches, which aims to attenuate the market volatility in the past weeks. This proposal implies long term perspectives & $PAL liquidity mining removal.\n\nThe prices will be calculated from early July to early August.\n\nSince Paladin requires a precise amount of APW, the swap happen as follow :\nWeek 1 : 40000 APW = x PAL ((40K APW *TWAP price APW Week 1) / TWAP price PAL week 1) = x PAL\nWeek 2 : 40000 APW = x PAL\n…\nWeek 4 : 40000 APW = x PAL\n\n**Benefits for APWine DAO**\nCreate a long term position on PAL\nStake & Lock PAL to participate on the governance\nOnce defined, enjoy chest rights\nOnce possible, APWine will create a proposal to integrate Quest\nNew Paladin IBTs that can be integrated on the protocol (palTokens such as palhPal)\nIncrease the visibility of both projects with cross marketing\n\n**Benefits for Paladin DAO**\nCreate a long term position on APW\nAbility to vote on APW gauges with veAPW\nIncrease the yield for palStkAave pools users\nIncrease the governance participation\nIncrease the visibility of both projects with cross marketing\n\n**Means:**\n160000 APW for the token swap\n\n**Technical implementation:**\nPaladin Community Gnosis Safe should be able to lock the veAPW\nCalculate the TWAP price and make the swaps each week\n\n**Voting options:**\nYes\nNo\nAbstain",

      "title": "APGP 8 : Organize Community Calls",
      "content": "**Key words:**\nCommunity Calls, Governance. \n\n**Summary:**\nSetup monthly community calls to discuss different topics, and weekly calls focused on governance. \n\n**Context:**\nLike any DeFi project, community is very important to the well-being of the protocol and its meaning in the crypto universe. That is why it’s important to organize 1 General Community Call per month. Giving APW users a feeling of community and general goodwill, which is key to creating an active and healthy governing body.\n\n**Rationale:**\nGeneral Community Calls will enable the community to better involve themselves in APWine's progress and identity. This call would happen once a month on Twitter space during approximately 1h, however the date can change from one month to another depending on speakers availability. \n\nThe general Community Calls would cover: \n- Presentation of the speakers \n- General progress talk : events, previous shipping, hackatons \n- Talk of the previous hackatons winners \n- Devs updates \n- Governance & bounties updates \n- External speakers (partners /New integrations) \n- Q&As \n- POAPs\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to propose weekly calls to keep everyone up to date on the progress of governance in the discourse and snapshot, as well as the bounties discussions and submissions. This call would happen once a week on discord during 15-30 min, the day and time are still TBD. \n\n**Means:** \nNo treasury funds - No dev work\n\n**Technical implementations:**\n- Create a discord Stage for users to join on governance calls. \n- Create an announcement in the discord and Twitter for every general community call so that people may be made aware of its existence.\n- Moderators/admin work to keep stage fair and clean so devs don't get interrupted and users are able to share their thoughts.\n- Record these calls to publish it on different APWine communication channels. \n\n**Voting options:**\n- Yes, setup both Com. calls and Gov. calls \n- Only setup general community calls \n- Only setup governance calls \n- No, do nothing\n- Abstain",

      "title": "APGP 11 : Bounties budget handled by a community multisig",
      "content": "**Summary:**\nReward some community actions with bounties\n\n**Context:**\nI recently set up Dework on APWine discord, which is a platform allowing users to create bounties (tech or non-tech) which are tasks needed for the DAO.\n\nEither the team can create tasks, or the community can make suggestions to create new tasks so don’t hesitate if you have ideas of bounties, share it here.\n\nOnce a contributor is assigned to a task, it’s possible to submit what was done, which will have to be approved by a reviewer to receive the rewards.\n\nI created a multisig to handle the bounties budget, and would like to propose to add signers from the community. The next APGP will be about the multisig elections.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe goal of this proposal is to allocate a small amount of APW to test Dework with the community before voting on a bigger budget if the test is successful, and to add signers from the community to handle the bounties multisig.\n\nOn the APGP 10, we voted to allocate 250K/262.5K APW of unclaimed airdrop to rewards veAPW holders.\n\nThe idea would be to use the 12.5K APW left on the contract \nAs the tokens are on mainnet, we’ll need to bridge it to Polygon and send it to the multisig.\n\nIn order to reach 8 signers for the multisig, the community will be able to apply in the APGP 12. The goal is to have 5 / 8 signers.\n\n**Means:**\n12.5K APW from the unclaimed airdrop\n\n**Technical implementation:**\nBridge 12.5K APW to Polygon and transfer to the new multisig\n\n**Voting options:**\nYes, allocate 12.5K APW to try dework\nNo, do nothing \nAbstain",

      "content": "**Summary:**\nImplement APW rewards for veAPW holders.\n\n**Context:**\nIn December 2021, 1.18% of the supply was airdropped to APWine Alpha & Beta users and LBP participants which represent 588430 APW tokens.\n\nAs there was a 1 month claiming period before the airdrop started to decrease and half of it locked for 6 months to try the governance mechanisms, 44% of the tokens remained unclaimed, which represents 262500 APW, held on this contract 1.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe veAPW currently represent over 15% of the supply locked, which is very good in a few months, but it could increase faster. For now, users who lock their APW can vote on the governance proposals and the token emission each week, but there is no yield.\n\nRecently the APGP 1 was voted on how to use the 0.05% earned by the DAO on swap fees, however these fees are too low to incentivize more lock for now.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to discuss using 44% of the tokens unclaimed allocated to the airdrop, to bootstrap the governance participation with a yield in APW tokens.\n\nThe distribution would be regressive over time because the protocol should generate enough revenues in the coming months to compensate for the reduction. Other revenue streams like part of the farming rewards could also be distributed to veAPW holders if this is voted on.\n\nHere’s a possible distribution of 250000 APW (0.5% of the total supply) over the next 2 years:\n\n![image](ipfs://QmRqYZry7y463teQY5DSq18ULtxB56ny8DP79j6vw7rkQ9)\n\n**Means:**\n0.5% of the total supply, which are tokens unclaimed from the airdrop, so no additional expenses for the DAO.\n\n**Technical implementation:**\nTop up the reward contract and add a claim button on the governance UI.\n\n**Voting options:**\nYes, distribute unclaimed airdrop to veAPW holders\nNo, do nothing\nAbstain",

      "content": "Summary:\nStop the Sushi rewards and redeploy part or all of it on a new Curve V2 pool.\n\nContext:\nA few weeks ago, @remilm started a dicussion on creating a factory pool and redirecting the sushi rewards on votium bribes.\nConsidering that Tokemak owns 95% of the Sushi liquidity, this pool doesn’t need incentives anymore. The goal of this proposal would be to use part or all the Sushi LM budget to bootstrap the liquidity on a new Curve v2 LP APW/ETH.\n\nOnce there’s enough liquidity the goal will be to add a gauge to the controller to earn CRV.\n\nSome community members also mentioned to use part of the sushi rewards for a new LM program on another chain.\n\nRationale:\nThis proposal aims to deploy a factory pool APW/ETH on Curve V2 and use the Sushi rewards to bootstrap the pool. Even if tokemak isn’t supporting Curve v2 LPs at the moment, they might in the future.\n\nThe current Sushi rewards represent 250K APW/year, which could be partially or totally redirected to the Curve LP.\n\nIn this proposal I suggest to vote about stopping the Sushi LM and Deploying the factory pool, then create another proposal to discuss new LM programs\n\nTechnical implementation:\nDeploy the Curve factory pool\nStop sending the rewards to the Sushi contract\n\nMeans:\nNo extra expenses\n\nVoting options:\nYes, Stop sushi LM & Deploy a curve v2 factory pool\nOnly Stop the sushi LM\nOnly Deploy a Curve v2 factory pool\nNo, Don’t stop the LM or deploy a factory pool\nAbstain",

But community support is not everything, the DAO also voted to share the love and incentivize the palStkAave pool with PAL. The incentives started this week.\n\nPaladin is fully aware that other projects will intend to bribe TOKE holders for votes. Paladin will not do so publicly as it would create significant sell pressure on PAL, but instead, prepare OTC deals with a few DAOs, namely APWine. \n\n3 Options for this: \n- Do a direct deal with the treasury of the DAO and pay at the rate of bribes of the last round (0.12$/vote), which would be 27950 PAL at current price (based on a 14 days TWAP) \n- Add 3500 PAL/week on the LM of the palStkAave pools for next 8 weeks\n- Split the budget between LM and Treasury \n\n**Means / Technical Implementations:**\nClick the vote button with the treasury account holding the tTOKE.\n\n**Voting Options:**\nFor Option 1 - Direct treasury deal\nFor Option 2 - Extra LM deal\nFor Option 3 - Split LM & treasury\nAgainst - Do Nothing.\nAbstain\n",

Some holders also removed liquidity in the past days.\nFinally a few days ago, there was an increase of the liquidity deployed up to 1.2M APW + 308 ETH, representing 95% of the APW/ETH Sushi LP, related to the 0.5x multiplicator. \n\nThe new state of the liquidity is the following :\nSushi APW/ETH : 1.87M$ ( 95% is deployed by Tokemak)\nUni APW/ETH: 19.5K$\nBancor (soon) around 800K$\n\nThis push the current liquidity to 2.69M$.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThis proposal aims to let the DAO decide if we should reduce the liquidity or keep it as it is.\n\nIf the DAO decide to reduce the liquidity, we will ask Tokemak to withdraw the deployed liquidity and add it progressively by tranches of 200K$ each week by voting.\nIf the DAO decides to keep the liquidity as it is, there is nothing to do beside actually voting for the full deployment once\n\nIt’s not possible for now to increase the liquidity on Tokemak, however we can think about a way to increase the protocol owned liquidity on another proposal.\n\n**Means:**\nNone\n\n**Technical implementation:**\nAsk Tokemak to withdraw the deployed liquidity if voted\nVote weekly to add progressively the liquidity if this option is voted\n\n**Voting options:**\nReduce the liquidity on Tokemak\nKeep the liquidity as it is\nAbstain",

      "content": "# APGP 6: Commit 127,000 APW for the Dual Liquidity Mining Program on Bancor 3\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to launch an APW/BNT liquidity mining campaign for the APW liquidity pool on Bancor 3.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThere has been a discussion to [deploy 400,000 APWine to Bancor POL](https://gov.apwine.fi/t/apgp-4-allocate-400-000-apwine-to-bancor-pol/183/11). To further deepen the APWine/Bancor relationship, this proposal seeks to commit 127,000 APWine for Bancor 3's Dual Liquidity Mining Program in order to maximise the BNT matching rewards of 50,000 BNT, all going to APWine LPs.\n\nBancor 3’s distinguishable features from other Decentralized Exchanges include:\n\n* Infinite Single-sided staking.\n\n* Instant Impermanent Loss (IL) Protection - Instant protection from the moment you stake. There is a 7 day cooldown period and 0.25% withdrawal fee. At the end of the cooldown period, if an LP chooses to leave the pool, they forfeit the fees and rewards accrued during the cooldown period back to the pool. The withdrawal fee is used by the protocol only to assist with paying out Impermanent Loss Protection.\n\n* LP tokens - bnAPW LP tokens that represent single-sided APW with no IL downside, making them great collateral and very useful for governance or native staking strategies.\n\n* Dual LM rewards - No need for external contracts; the APW rewards auto-compound for all LPs gaslessly and immediately become available liquidity in the pool. The APW rewards can be claimed or staked in a separate rewards contract that accepts bnAPW.\n\n## Dual Liquidity Mining Program\n\nThe BancorDAO has approved a [Dual Liquidity Mining Program ](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-addendum-incentivize-users-to-migrate-to-v3-by-matching-token-side-lm-rewards-with-up-to-50-000-bnt-per-pool-available-once-per-pool-offer-open-until-the-end-of-may-2022/3512) with a cut-off date at the end of May whereby:\n\n* Any APW committed to the Bancor 3 LM campaign in the APW pool will be matched 1:1 in dollar value with 50,000 BNT in rewards, all going to APW LPs.\n\n* As mentioned above, the BNT LM rewards will be provided in a separate rewards contract that accepts bnAPW and can be claimed or staked in the BNT pool.\n\n* The BNT rewards will be emitted over 24 months on a flat emission schedule. The APW rewards don’t need to follow the same schedule - the APWine DAO can choose the rate of the APW distribution per block, total amount and model (flat or exponential decay emission models).\n\n**Means / Technical Implementations**\n\nAll that would be required of the team is to add APW liquidity in the pool and stake the bnAPW in the LM rewards contract.\n",

      "title": "APGP 4: Allocate 400,000 APWine to Bancor POL",
      "content": "Summary\nThere is currently 480,000 APWine Worth of Space in the Bancor Pool. Bancor provides the treasury with two key features Impermanent Loss Protection and Single Sided Staking. This will mean the DAO is guaranteed a return on it’s investment, will need to provide no counter asset like ETH, and will grow the depth of APWine Liquidity by just under 1M USD (50% BNT from Bancor DAO/ 50% APW from APWine DAO)\n\nContext\nBancor is a DEX with over 1 Billion USD in TVL. The Core product offerings are Single-Sided Staking and IL Protection which make it the optimal solution for DAO sourced Liquidity. The DAO would be opening up a new and insured revenue stream while at the same time allowing for lower slippage which should allow entry for larger investors.\n\nIt’s also worth noting the Bancor Community is well aligned to work with APWine when B3 Launches since single sided LP tokens are a perfect fit for the APWine future yield model. Bancor also has a favorable view of APWine as can be seen by the fact we received one of their rare Liquidity Mining Campaigns. This is not the last we will receive as well, should we choose to launch dual LM on B3 the Bancor DAO has already approved 50,000 BNT to be distributed in the APWine Pool over 24 months.\n\nRationale\nThe BancorDAO has already approved the Co-Invested BNT Here: Proposal: Whitelist APWine.fi ($APW) / 250K BNT Co-investment (2nd attempt) - DAO Archive (SUBMITTED) - Bancor Governance Forum 3\nAll that would be required of the team is a simple approve() and addLiquidity() functions on the Bancor APWine Contract.",

      "content": "**Summary:**\nDeploy the fees distributor to create a native yield for veAPW holders, and the smart wallet checker to allow other DAOs to enter the APWar.\n\n**Context:**\nCurrently there is no yield on veAPW, however , if APGP 1 is voted, there is a need for a new contract called the fees distributor.\n\nOnly EOA can currently lock APW on the veAPW contract. A smart wallet checker needs to be deployed to allow contracts (Multisigs, DAOs etc) to lock APW. This is also needed to tokenize the veAPW.\n\n**Rationale:**\n**I) Fees distributor:**\nIf the APGP 1 is voted for the distribution, and if this proposal is approved, the fees distributor will be deployed\n\nThis is a contract allowing to distribute part of the collected fees to veAPW holders. This might also be useful to create the sdAPW liquid locker.\n\n**II) Smart wallet checker:**\nTo have the possibity to whitelist any address to lock APW on the voting escrow contract, a smart wallet checker is needed for DAOs and multisigs too.\n\nAs the liquid locker is a tokenization of the veAPW, it’s a contract that needs to be whitelisted to be able to lock the underlying token.\n\nTo have everything ready before the next gauge vote, this proposal will exceptionally have 5 days of voting period instead of 8 days.\n\n**Means:**\nDev work \nNo treasury funds \n\n**Technical implementation:**\n- Deploy the fees distributor\n- Deploy the smart wallet checker\n\n**Voting options:**\nYes, deploy both contracts\nYes, deploy only the fees distributor \nYes, deploy only the smart wallet checker \nNo, don’t deploy the contracts\nAbstain",

      "content": "**Key words:**\nTreasury allocation, reward long term holders\n\n**Summary:**\nUse part of the 0.05% swap fee collected by the treasury to generate a yield for veAPW holders\n\n**Context:**\nSince the launch of the protocol, APW holders can lock their tokens for up to two years to increase their voting power, but $veAPW holders aren’t incentivized to lock, so a lot of Apwine are held in liquidity pools or on Tokemak.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe goal of this proposal is to activate a yield for veAPW holders that can be claimed every week for example. Considering that the DAO incomes might be too low for now, it can be interesting to consider bridging the fees on Polygon to make it accessible for every user.\n\nIf the DAO decides to distribute these funds, we can consider several approaches:\n\n- Distribute every token as collected (Geist model)\n- Sell collected fees for stables claimable (Curve model)\n- Sell collected fees for ETH claimable\n- Sell collected fees for APW claimable\n- Let the choice to either receive stable, ETH or APW\n\n**Benefits of the stables/ETH options:**\n- Generate a yield in stable, independent of the APW price\n- Can be distributed in a strategy (for example PTaUSDT/USDT LPs)\n- Less token to claim (less gas fees)\n\n**Benefits of the APW buy back option:**\n- Buying pressure on APW\n- Incentivize users to increase their voting power\n- Less token to claim (less gas fees)\n\n**Benefits of the several tokens options:**\n- Can be converted to PTs\n- Yield diversification for the users\n\nIf this proposal passes, there will be another one about accumulating the rewards for a period on mainnet before bridging it to Polygon and reduce users gas fees.\n\n**Means:**\n70% of the collected fees distributed to veAPW holders, 30% accumulated in the treasury.\n\n**Technical implementation:**\nFees distributor contract deployment\n\nVoting options:\nYes, sell 70% of the fees for APW claimable\nYes, sell 70% of the fees for stables claimable\nYes, sell 70% of the fees for ETH claimable\nYes, leave the choice between ETH, Stable and APW\nYes, distribute 70% of the fees in the tokens collected\nNo, change the repartition\nNo, don't distribute any fees to veAPW holders\nAbstain",

Once done, DAOs can be whitelisted if approved on a proposal, which will allow to tokenize the veAPW.\n\nIf the APIP 3 (https://snapshot.org/#/apwine.eth/proposal/0x35da103a29421f0cf4bef55a00555ba52942cab01c7859e72005d03004c82c67 - still in vote) is voted for, the goal of this proposal is to whitelist Stake DAO which will allow to lock and tokenize the veAPW with sdAPW liquid locker and the associated strategy.\n\n**Technical implementation:**\nWhitelist Stake DAO to lock veAPW\n\n**Voting options:**\nYes\nNo\nAbstain",

      "title": "APGP 3: Token Swap: APWine x Stake DAO",
      "content": "**Forum post:** https://gov.apwine.fi/t/apgp-3-token-swap-apwine-x-stake-dao/176/1\n\n**Summary:**\nExpand the partnership between Stake DAO and APWine DAO by performing a 500K$ treasury swap of SDT for APW which will be used to increase the synergies between both protocols\n\n**Context:**\nStake DAO is a Defi Protocol with over 750M$ TVL and deployed on 5 different networks: Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Harmony and BSC. This project offers several opportunities to grow your crypto assets: Yield Optimizer, Options, DEX, Arbitrage strategies and is launching a new product called the liquid lockers.\n\nThe Liquid Lockers (LL) is a new feature created for veTokens, allowing governance token holders to lock in the LL and receive sdTokens. This allows holders to keep a liquid position, as the sdTokens can either be staked to earn yield while enjoying all the governance rights associated, or added in the LL strategies which are sdTokens/Tokens pools. \n\nThe SDT tokenomics will be changed for a ve-model, so veSDT holders will be able to vote on gauges for the Liquid Lockers and the LL strategies gauges, but also to boost the voting power on sdTokens staked and earn part of the protocol fees. More informations on the LL and veSDT can be found here.\n\nSince APW is a ve-model, and considering the ongoing gauges vote, Stake DAO would like to become an active participant of the APWine DAO.\n\n**Rationale:**\nA mirror of this proposal has been posted on the SD forum, so this post will be updated depending on the SD vote results.\n\n**Token swap:**\nStake DAO would like to propose a token swap of 500K$ worth between both DAO.\nThe proposed token swap conditions are:\n\n- Split the swap with 50K$ tranches during 10 weeks\n- The swap price will be determined with a 3 Day TWAP before each swap\n- Both DAOs should lock at least the 1st tranche, and can wait the liquid lockers for the next ones\n- The tokens received will be used for gauge voting ang governance purposes\n\n**APW Liquid locker and strategy creation:** (if accepted on SD vote)\nStake DAO propose to create a liquid locker for APWine, so users could lock their APW on Stake DAO and receive sdAPW, enjoying all the voting rights of the veAPW, the Liquid locker yield, while keeping a liquid position.\n\n**Stake DAO treasury allocation:** (if accepted on SD vote)\nStake DAO propose to allocate 15% of the Stablecoins treasury in the FRAX3CRV and sdam3CRV PT/Underlying pools\n\nOnce live, each sdTokens could be proposed to wine listing events, which means that you could sell your yield and voting rights in advance.\n\n**Benefits for Apwine DAO:**\nCreate a long term position on SDT\nCreation of a Liquid Locker and a sdAPW/APW strategy both eligible for gauges rewards by locking SDT and voting with veSDT (if voted by SD governance)\nOnce live, APW holders will be able to boost their voting power on sdAPW with their veSDT\nOnce live, new IBTs that can be integrated on the protocol (sdTokens)\nIncrease the visibility of both projects with cross marketing\nIncrease of the TVL and revenues with Stake DAO treasury deposits (if accepted by the SD vote)\n\n**Benefits for Stake DAO:**\nCreate a long term position on APW\nAbility to vote on APW gauges with veAPW/sdAPW\nIncrease the governance participation and DAO revenues by farming APW rewards\nsdTokens can be integrated as IBTs on APWine once live\nIncrease the visibility of both projects with cross marketing\n\n**Means:**\nSwap the tokens every week over 2.5 months\n\n**Technical implementation:**\nThe swap price will be determined with a 3 Day TWAP before each swap\n\n**Voting options:**\nYes, accept the token swap \nNo, refuse the token swap\nAbstain",

      "title": "APGP 2: Enable gauges for APW rewards",
      "content": "**Summary:**\nThis proposal is about creating a gauge for the community to distribute APW rewards.\n\n**Context:**\nThe liquidity mining program started two months ago, with a 2M APW distribution each quarter. However until now, the rewards were split fairly between all pools (PT/Underlying and PT/FYT).\n\nEnabling a gauge to vote on APW rewards distribution each week would kickstart the APWAR, as every project would have an interest to buy and lock APW to boost their own pool rewards.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThis proposal is about allowing veAPW holders to vote on the APW rewards distribution across the different pools. Apwine is currently rewarding users on mainnet and Polygon to deposit liquidity in the PT/Underlying and PT/FYT pools.\nThe total amount of rewards distributed over a week is currently 166.66K APW/week.\n\nIf the gauge is approved, the distribution of the 166.66K APW would be decided by veAPW holders every week, who would have the power to allocate a percentage of the rewards on different pools or to return part of the APW to the DAO, which would reduce the current incentives.\n\n**Means:**\nCurrent liquidity mining program: 166.66K APW/week\n\n**Implementation:**\nSetup of the new UI to vote on the gauges.",

      "title": "Apwine governance framework proposal",
      "content": "**Key words:**\nFramework, governance structure, proposal types\n\n**Summary:**\nI propose to create a governance framework for the Apwine governance, inspired by several other protocols, in order to have qualitative discussions on the governance forum.\n\n**Proposal rationale:**\nThis post aims to define a framework for the Apwine governance, by defining several types of proposals depending on the subject discussed,voting on DAO rules, and creating templates that should be helpful for everyone trying to participate.\n\nPosting a proposal on the governance forum and discussing it there and on discord first allow to get a sentiment check and some valuable feedback about the community ideas and upcoming snapshot votes. We could open a channel for each proposal on discord and archive it once voted.\n\n**I) Required informations for any proposal:**\n\n**Governance forum post:** Each proposal should be posted on the governance forum for at least 48 hours before posting the snapshot, which allows the community to give some feedback, propose changes, and vote on a community sentiment poll.\n\n**Proposal type, number and name:** Each proposal must be easily identifiable and correctly classified.\n\n**Type:** APIR - APGP - APIP. This will be detailed in the second part of the proposal\n**Name:** The name must be the same on the forum post and snapshot (Max 10 words)\n**Number:** Each proposal must have a number that represents the post order on the forum and on snapshot\n**Summary:** Short description of the proposal (1-2 sentences max)\n\n**Rationale:** Detailed explanation of the proposal and milestones for its execution.\n\n**Means:** Resources needed for this proposal\n- Human resources: Special skills required (dev or others)\n- Treasury ressources: Proposal cost (in APW and in $), % of the treasury required\n\n**Technical implementation:** Highlight the technical implementations of this proposal if any\n\n**Voting options:** Mention the options that will be included on the snapshot vote, including an “Abstain” one.\n\n**II) Proposals types and formats:**\n\nInspired by the Paladin framework with different sections, we could define different types of proposals, depending on the subject discussed and the importance for the protocol. Each type could have different quorums needed.\n\nConsidering that the circulating supply and the total amount of possible votes are changing very often, the best option is probably to have dynamics quorums following the votes amount.\n\nAs a reminder, here is an overview of the $APW voting power weight, depending the form:\n- 1 APW locked 2 years gives 104 votes (veAPW) as 1 vote = 1 APW locked for one week\n- 1APW on Tokemak gives 1 vote \n- 1 APW in Sushi LP or Cometh LP gives 1 vote too\n\n**APWine Integration Request (APIR):**\n\nProposal to add a new protocol to Apwine, and one or several pools in the winelisting voting options. There is a template available on the forum to help projects to easily apply by creating a governance post (and filling a form about the technical requirements)\n\nThis type of proposal should include, in addition to all the points mentioned in the first part: :\n\n**Project Presentation:** (After summary)\n- Protocol name\n- Interest Bearing Token (IBT) requested\n- IBT contract address\n- Audit(s) links\n- Supported chain(s): Ethereum / Polygon / Both\n- Twitter/Discord/Telegram links\n\n**Project metrics:** (After project presentation)\n- Current protocol TVL\n- Current IBT(s) TVL\n- IBT(s) daily volume\n- Community size on Twitter/Discord/Telegram\n- Estimated extra yield for $veAPW holders or Winemakers thanks to this proposal if any\n\n**Community sentiment poll:** (After voting options)\nA poll on the governance forum post to get a first sentiment at least 48 hours before submitting a snapshot proposal.\n\nConsidering that the integrations proposals can happen quite often, and that the risk for the protocol is lower than other proposal types, we could consider the following parameters:\n\n**Admin:** Team multisig\n**Quorum:** 2.5% of the total possible votes\n**Voting duration:** 3 days\n\n**Apwine Governance Proposal (APGP):**\n\nAPGPs are about common governance proposals, especially the ones related to the treasury of the protocole and the DAO organization. I’ll publish a template on the forum in the coming days.\n\nThis type of proposal should include, in addition to all the points mentioned in the first part:\n\n**Context:** (After summary)\nComprehensive overview of the proposal,treasury breakdown if needed.\n\nThe APGPs would concern but wouldn’t be limited to:\n- Treasury allocation strategy & budgets\n- Liquidity mining votes & winelistings\n- Grant program if any\n- Contributors/Dao committees rewards\n- Long term partnerships (i.e Dao Swaps)\n\nAPGPs concern the protocol treasury directly, which is why it might be best to define more conservative parameters than APIR ones:\n\n**Admin:** Team multisig\n**Quorum:** 10% of the total possible votes\n**Voting duration:** 6 days\n\n**APWine Improvement Protocol (APIP):**\n\nAPIPs are about the most important modifications either on the the governance framework, or on the protocole direcly.\n\nThis type of proposal should include, in addition to all the points mentioned in the first part:\n\n**Context:** What’s the modification and why it’s needed.\n\nThe APIPs would concern but wouldn’t be limited to:\n- New version of the protocol\n- Modification of a smart contract\n- Updates on the initial parameters\n- Modification of the governance framework\n- Add/Remove a signer on the treasury multisig\n- Protocol fees activation\n\nAPIPs are the most critical and important types of proposals, as it’s directly about the core product of Apwine or a major change in the functioning of governance.\nIt’s very important to get as much community members aware of this kind of proposal for them to vote accordingly, which is why we should consider more conservative parameters, and a longer voting period:\n\n**Admin:** Team multisig\n**Quorum:** 20% of the total possible votes\n**Voting duration:** 10 days\n\n**Voting Options:**\n- Accept the governance framework\n- Refuse and rework the proposal\n- Abstain",

      "content": "**Summary**\n\nSwap $3M worth of APW for $3M worth of TOKE to ignite the APW Tokemak Reactor \n\n**Background and Motivation**  \n\nThe (🍇,🍷) community has recently launched a reactor on Tokemak and APWine now aims to ignite the reactor to supercharge liquidity. \n \nThe start of this long term journey must begin with a APW <> TOKE Swap which will: \n\n• Align incentives between communities \n• Ensure that we have voting power to increase the TOKE rewards for the APW reactor \n• Diversify the APWine Treasury\n• Stake TOKE and direct liquidity to the APW/ETH pair\n\n\nAn active APW Reactor on Tokemak will ultimately increase protocol liquidity and open the door for unique opportunities within the Tokemak ecosystem. APWine is ready to swap $3M worth of APW for TOKE to ignite the Tokemak Reactor. The $3M will serve as a reserve fund for Tokemak that can be used to dampen the highly-unlikely event of impermanent loss for users. We anticipate this will be an ongoing liquidity farming program, and based on the success will likely repeat.  APWine recognizes the innovative and disruptive “liquidity as a service” Tokemak offers to the DeFi space at large and we are eager to add additional functionality on our side by facilitating a trading market for Tokemak Yield. This collaboration ultimately increases the utility and value of APW as traders/farmers have increased liquidity, trading pairs, and less slippage to worry about. Furthermore, APWine is working on deploying across different L1’s, so the liquidity can be utilized among other communities. \n\n**Consideration**\n\nFor the provision of these services, the parties agree that within one day of this Proposal being approved that:\n\n$3,000,000.00 notional value (USDC) of APW will be sent by the APW Core Contributors to the Tokemak treasury; and\n\n$3,000,000.00 notional value (USDC) of TOKE will be sent by Tokemak to the APWine treasury.\n\nExecution will be based on the current 7-day moving price average with no discount. Further, It is mutually understood that this will be a long-term collaboration and funds will not be used to speculate, sell, or distribute outside of this liquidity incentive for the time being. \n\nThe APWine DAO will be able to indirectly utilize the treasury TOKE tokens to vote for redirecting liquidity in the future. TOKE will be sent to the DAO once the reactor officially ignites and announcements will be made. \n",
