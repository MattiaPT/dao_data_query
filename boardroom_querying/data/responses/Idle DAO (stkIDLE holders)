      "title": "[IIP-39] Update IDLE distribution, Steakhouse USDC as a new USDC BY yield source, transfer USDC to see the IDLE-USDC pool, transfer M2-2024 budget",
      "content": "The following is an extract of the proposal posted on the [Idle governance forum](https://gov.idle.finance/t/iip-39-update-idle-distribution-steakhouse-usdc-as-a-new-usdc-by-yield-source-transfer-usdc-to-see-the-idle-usdc-pool-transfer-m2-2024-budget/1255).\n\n### Summary\nThe IIP aims to pause the Liquidity Mining program, formalize the strategic round agreement with Rockway X, update the USDC Best Yield’s vault underlying markets, seed a new IDLE pool launch on Uniswap, and transfer the M2-2024 budget to Leagues.\n\n## Rationale\n### 1. IDLE incentives distribution update\nThe DAO agreed to pause the Liquidity Mining program that has been distributing IDLE to users since 2021\n\n> ### Pause the Liquidity Mining program\n>\n>One option is to pause the Liquidity Mining distribution\n>\n> * From 250 to 0 IDLE/day\n>\n> From a DAO treasury perspective, this option would stop the emission of IDLE and reduce the selling pressure on the DAO governance token.\n> \n> Given the current low emission, the yields of BY vaults would be minimally affected. A possible downside of this pause is linked to the integrators that rely on IDLE rewards. To adjust this the DAO may update the [Integrators program](https://docs.idle.finance/products/get-involved/integrators-program) and create ad-hoc solutions for partners that count on the additional return given by IDLE.\n\n### 2. Strategic round with Rockway X\nIn light of the recent round closure, the parties agreed not to transfer/vest any IDLE tokens to the investor. The DAO tokens will be kept in the long-term reward fund.\n\nRockwayX will transfer the stablecoin to the Idle DAO’s fee treasury in 2 tranches\n\n> **Agreement Terms**\n> The terms of the agreement remain largely unchanged, except for the investment structure. The investment will now occur in two tranches of $500,000 each with the second tranche tied to $50M TVL milestone, as partly mentioned in our previous update [here](https://gov.idle.finance/t/iip-39-update-idle-distribution-transfer-idle-to-vesting-contract-steakhouse-usdc-as-a-new-usdc-by-yield-source-transfer-usdc-to-see-the-idle-usdc-pool/1250/2). The first $500,000 tranche has been already deposited into the [Fee Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x69a62c24f16d4914a48919613e8ee330641bcb94#tokentxns) controlled by Idle DAO.\n\n> This proposal is meant to formalize the funding round and strategic agreement between Idle DAO and [Rockaway X ](https://rockawayx.com/) to solidify the relationship as liquidity providers and users of our product suite and pave the way for a new line of institutional-grade yield products.\n\n> This funding round provides the following:\n> \n> * Rockaway X will allocate 1,000,000 USDC (or other stablecoins) to Idle DAO’s Fee Treasury.\n> * Idle DAO will allocate 1,733,333 IDLE from the Idle DAO’s [Long Term Fund ](https://etherscan.io/address/0x107a369bc066c77ff061c7d2420618a6ce31b925) to Rockaway X Vesting Contract.\n> \n> IDLE tokens taken from Long Term Fund will be subject to a 2-year vesting period, with 33% released after a 12-month cliff and the rest with a 12-month block-by-block linear vesting.\n\n### 3. Steakhouse vault as new yield source for USDC BY\nThe Steakhouse Senior Tranche will be added as a new yield source to the USDC Best Yield vault. \n\n> Following the [M1-2024 roadmap](https://gov.idle.finance/t/leagues-m1-2024-roadmap-and-m4-2023-recap/1231), Idle DAO Leagues has initiated the process of revamping the Best Yield vaults. This process counts on multiple steps:\n> \n> 1. Unwind the Junior Best Yield vaults\n> 2. Renew the BY underlying yield sources to offer the best yield-optimized offering in the market\n> \n> This post aims to expand on the second step listed and specifically focuses on the USDC Best Yield market.\n\nThe vault will improve the yield of the USDC BY vault while having a safe risk score of B.\n\n### 4. AMM liquidity improvements\nTo improve the IDLE liquidity in the markets, the DAO decided to follow these steps (2/3 already completed). In light of the recent round closed and the new agreement terms, Leagues advise reducing the liquidity increase by half, i.e. $75k, to ensure enough working capital to achieve the next steps in the roadmap. \n\n> The DAO has shared his preferences about the next steps for the IDLE AMM liquidity improvements:\n> \n> * Migrate the 8020 IDLE pool to Uniswap v3\n> * Launch an IDLE-USDC pool on Uniswap v3\n> * Bootstrap the pool with $150,000 of DAO’s treasury\n\n### 5. M2-2024 Leagues budget\nThis IIP will be used also to transfer the M2-2024 budget that has been pending since the DAO vote. \n\n> ## Leagues M2-2024 Expected Budget\n> \n>  ![image](ipfs://bafkreicmhhik444vlg6knxvkjuby7xtw65vf3534hmwzcqwljiqg7guio4)\n>   \n> \n> **The [expected budget for M2-2024 ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w1KJkc3c6BW2N7zfmh9RCg0OcHZPdfiL3D2tTVfK9bI/edit?usp=sharing) is $148’015 in stablecoin and 66’490 IDLE (using a 20-day rolling price at the time of writing).**\n> \n> At the time of writing, the [Treasury League multisig](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0xFb3bD022D5DAcF95eE28a6B07825D4Ff9C5b3814) stablecoin or equivalents holdings currently stand at $55’343 in stablecoins (excluding $129’353 in ETH/WBTC/altcoins, using price at the current time) so if the Temperature Check for IDLE tokenholders is positive, $92’672 funds will be transferred from the [Fee Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x69a62c24f16d4914a48919613e8ee330641bcb94) (in either one or two installments), and 66’490 IDLE will be transferred from the [Ecosystem Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aa1f98523ec15932dd5faac5d86e57115571c7) via the next IIP.\n\n## Specifications\nThe code of the IIP-39 can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Idle-Finance/idle-proposals/blob/main/scripts/iip-39.ts#L86-L99) and consists of 5 actions.\n\nIIP-39 actions:\n\n* 1 action to set the Liquidity Mining distribution, `_setIdleRate`, from 250 to 0 IDLE/day\n* 1 action to perform the last claim of all unclaimed IDLE for the Best Yields vault\n* 1 action to replace the cp_POR_USDC Senior Tranche with the Steakhouse USDC Senior Tranche in the Best Yield USDC vault\n* 1 action to transfer $75,000 equivalent in stablecoin from the Fee Treasury to the Treasury multisig wallet to seed the new IDLE-USDC pool on Uniswap*\n* 1 action to transfer $148,000 equivalent in stablecoin from the Fee Treasury and 66,490 IDLE from the Ecosystem fund to the Treasury multisig wallet to fund the Leagues’ budget for M2-2024*\n\nWhere the Steakhouse wrapper contract address is:\n\n* Steakhouse USDC Senior tranche `0x96Dd27112bDd615c3A2D649fe22d8eE27e448152`\n\n*Please note that the above actions concerning stablecoin transfers will be merged in the IIP code.",

      "content": "### Summary\nA proposal to discuss improving the IDLE liquidity on Ethereum.\n\n### References\nAMM Liquidity Improvements post - Jul 2023\n\n## Background\nBack in July 2023, @Davide shared a detailed analysis to improve the IDLE liquidity. Based on these inputs, the DAO agreed to launch an 80/20 pool on Balancer (80IDLE - 20USDC pool, 0x158e0fBC2271E1dCEbadD365a22E2B4dD173C0DB). \n\nDuring this period, Leagues have also started incentive quests on Paladin to collect BAL and AURA rewards and boost the yield offered on the 8020 pool.\n\nThe third step listed and voted on in Davide’s post, i.e. applying to the Balancer 8020 Grant, has been delayed due to the need to adjust the IDLE staking model and the need to have already a live 8020 integration in place.\n\n## Rationale\n\nLaunched in July 2023 after the IIP-38, the 8020 pool on Balancer offers interesting returns to LPs, generated some volumes, and brought some liquidity. The pool had an average liquidity of $50,000, with a peak of $100,000 (see the [Balancer pool analysis tool on Dune](https://dune.com/balancer/pool-analysis), where the IDLE pool ID is 0x158e0fbc2271e1dcebadd365a22e2b4dd173c0db0002000000000000000005a5).  Monthly volumes reached the highest level during December 23 and January 24, with an average size of $785. The fees collected were negligible, but this was expected due to the very low swap fee of 0.5%.\n\nLeagues also noted that the Balancer 8020 wasn’t always considered by major DEX aggregators, such as 1inch, 0x, and Kyberswap when swapping IDLE on Ethereum. This seems to be driven by the nature of the weighted pool itself as confirmed by the Balancer team.\n\n## Proposal\nTo improve the IDLE liquidity in the markets, Leagues advise the following steps:\n\n* Migrate the Balancer 8020 liquidity to Uniswap v3 where the DAO controls two positions in the IDLE-WETH pool (a full-range deployment, and a concentrated position).\n* Decide whether to launch a new stable pool on Uniswap, i.e. USDC - IDLE or swap the USDC balance into WETH.\n* Add liquidity concentrated around the current value and adjust the range through time.\n\nThe choice to pick Uniswap v3 is driven by the fact that the Uniswap pools currently route the majority (~76%) of IDLE swaps on mainnet (source [IDLE DEX metrics on Dune](https://dune.com/idle.finance/idle-dexs-metrics-ethereum)).\n\nAdditionally, Idle Leagues suggest using part of the forthcoming treasury to increase the size of the pool. The DAO is invited to share his ideas about the size of the deployment, but we could think about something in the range of $75,000 to $150,000. A deposit in this range should ensure enough size for the IDLE pool, without divesting too many funds from the operations.",

      "content": "The following is an extract of the proposal posted on the [Idle governance](https://gov.idle.finance/t/steakhouse-vault-as-new-yield-source-for-usdc-by/1242).\n\n### Summary\nA proposal to add the USDC Steakhouse MetaMorpho vault as a new yield source for the USDC Best Yield vault. \n\n### References\n* [Clearpool YTs as a new yield source for USDC BY - Portofino](https://gov.idle.finance/t/clearpool-yts-as-a-new-yield-source-for-usdc-by-portofino/1151) post\n* [Best Yield revamp: Junior BY vaults wind down](https://gov.idle.finance/t/best-yield-revamp-junior-by-vaults-wind-down/1233) post\n* [Steakhouse Financial](https://www.steakhouse.financial/) website\n\n[...]\n\n## Proposal\nThis proposal aims to add the Senior Steakhouse tranche as a new underlying yield source to the Best Yield USDC vault:\n\n* Steakhouse USDC vault, with specs available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Idle-Finance/best-yield-PYT-strategy/blob/master/src/MetamorphoPYTStrategy.sol) and wrapper contract available [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x96Dd27112bDd615c3A2D649fe22d8eE27e448152)\n\nSimilar to previous yield source integrations, Steakhouse's one would benefit doubly the Idle users\n\n> 1. The USDC BY strategy can add a new yield source, besides the usual Aave and Compound, able to offer an average APY in the 5% to 10% range. Currently, [Aave](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&marketName=proto_mainnet) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/markets/USDC) offer APYs lower than 1%. This significant increase in yield can benefit current BY LPs and attract new users to the protocol.\n> 2. The USDC BY funds flowing to the Senior side of Clearpool PYTs can create a stable source of funding for the Senior tranches and consequently incentive new Junior liquidity deployments thanks to the boosted APYs available (with an expected average APY in the range of 10% to 20%).\n\nThe Steakhouse vault is currently offering ~8.5% yield on Senior (plus additional MORPHO rewards). If integrated into the USDC BY vault, the supported yield sources would be:\n\n| Yield source |  Vertical | \n| --- | --- | \n| Compound | Overcollateralized lending |\n| Aave v2 | Overcollateralized lending |\n| Clearpool-Portofino (Senior) | Uncollateralized lending |\n| Clearpool-Fasanara (Senior) | Uncollateralized lending |\n| Steakhouse (Senior) | Overcollateralized lending |\n\nTo set up the USDC vault in the most economically efficient way, given the high gas cost on mainnet, Leagues propose to add the Steakhouse Senior tranche, but at the same time, delist the Portofino Senior tranche. This would avoid an overload of rebalances and move back the vault towards an overcollateralized main nature.\n\n### Steakhouse Financial details\n> Our seasoned team of crypto-native collaborators brings a wealth of expertise in financial advisory, strategic planning, investment banking, analytics, accounting, legal research, and coding to help your DAO navigate the challenges and opportunities of the decentralized economy.\n\n> Steakhouse serves as a strategic advisor to Morpho Blue and runs a MetaMorpho Vault based on real-world assets.\n\nThe [Steakhouse USDC pool](https://app.idle.finance/#/earn/yield-tranches) has been live since the [beginning of January](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1745499650570830083) and currently holds ~$200,000 in liquidity. It hasn’t any borrowing limit.\n\n### Risk rating\n\nThe borrower has been already analyzed internally following the risk rating framework. The Steakhouse MetaMorpho USDC vault can be considered a valid market to become a new yield source of the Best Yield USDC market.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigm3qee6267yb3tljhwftjjhnzvc4yfincwhzlz4ylx35dhvaavs4)",

      "content": "### Summary\n\nA proposal to discuss the IDLE liquidity mining program continuation, adjustment or closure.\n\n### References\n\n* [IDLE incentives distribution update I](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-incentives-distribution-update/1030) - Aug 2022\n* [IDLE incentives distribution update II](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-incentives-distribution-update-v2/1104) - Jan 2023\n* [IDLE incentives distribution update III](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-incentives-distribution-update-v3/1149) - Apr 2023\n* [IDLE incentives distribution update IV](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-incentives-distribution-update-4/1186) - Aug 2023\n\n## Background\n\nThe IDLE liquidity mining program for the Best Yield vaults, and partially for Yield Tranches through the Gauges system, has been running since 2021. Multiple distribution rates were applied during this period, specifically:\n\n* Distribution I from 01/01/2021 until 08/06/2022 with 3,205 IDLE/day\n* Distribution II from 08/07/2022 until 12/31/2022 with 1,990 IDLE/day\n* Distribution III from 01/30/2023 until 03/13/2023 with 500 IDLE/day\n* Distribution IV from 04/09/2023 until 02/04/2024 with 250 IDLE/day\n\nThe acquisition cost of new liquidity through the LM program has shown significant variation over time:\n\n[quote=\"Biaf, post:1, topic:1030\"]\n\nThe Best Yield vaults received around 168k IDLE incentives (for an average $ value of $117k) and created around $18k in fees for the DAO.\n\n* For every $1 spent in IDLE incentives, the BY strategies generated $0.16 in fees for an overall acquisition cost of $0.84.\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"Biaf, post:1, topic:1104\"]\n\nThe Best Yield strategy received around 116k IDLE incentives (for an average dollar value of $478k with IDLE price equal to $4.12) and generated around $225k in fees for the DAO.\n\n* For every $1 spent in IDLE incentives, the BY strategies generated $0.47 in fees for an overall acquisition cost of $0.53\n\n[/quote]\n\n[quote=\"Biaf, post:1, topic:1149\"]\n\nThe Best Yield strategy received around 21k IDLE incentives, i.e. 47% of the funds, (for an average dollar value of $9k with IDLE price equal to $0.42) and generated around $22k in fees for the DAO.\n\n* For every $1 spent in IDLE incentives, the BY strategies generated $2.49 in fees\n\n[/quote]\n\n### Distribution 4\n\nThe Best Yield vaults received around 38k of IDLE incentives, for an average dollar value of $8.4k at a price equal to $0.22 for the period. The vaults generated around $15k in fees for the DAO.\n\n* For every $1 spent in IDLE incentives, the BY strategies generated $1.7 in fees\n\nThe latest rounds of distribution show a positive cost of acquisition driven by a mix of low amounts of IDLE distributed, prices, and liquidity retention from the previous periods. \nThese results seem to suggest that the incentivisation program for the Best Yield vaults has lost its efficiency and calls for a revision.\n\n## Proposals\n\n### 1. Pause the Liquidity Mining program\n\nOne option is to pause the Liquidity Mining distribution\n\n* From 250 to 0 IDLE/day\n\nFrom a DAO treasury perspective, this option would stop the emission of IDLE and reduce the selling pressure on the DAO governance token.\n\nGiven the current low emission, the yields of BY vaults would be minimally affected. A possible downside of this pause is linked to the integrators that rely on IDLE rewards. To adjust this the DAO may update the [Integrators program](https://docs.idle.finance/products/get-involved/integrators-program) and create ad-hoc solutions for partners that count on the additional return given by IDLE.\n\n### 2. Continue the Liquidity Mining program for 3 months\n\nThe Best Yield vaults have been incentivised through the Liquidity Mining program with different distribution rates (3205 → 2215 → 1000 → 500 → 250 IDLE/Day). One option is to extend for another 3 months the program at the same distribution rate set:\n\n* 250 IDLE/day for the next 3 months\n\nThe IDLE needed to fund this extension would be taken from the [Ecosystem fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aa1f98523ec15932dd5faac5d86e57115571c7).\n\nWe need to note that at the current emission rate, the extra yield offered would be really minimal, ~0.1% at the current price.\n\n### Next steps\n\nWe would like to gather the sentiment of Idle DAO toward the listed options:\n\n* Pause the Liquidity Mining program\n* Continue the Liquidity Mining program for 3 months at a 250 IDLE/day\n\nThis post will be open for discussion and in less than 24 hours, if there are no objections, we will proceed with the Temperature Check.",

      "title": "Idle DAO Strategic Round with Rockaway X",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal is meant to formalize the funding round and strategic agreement between Idle DAO and [Rockaway X](https://rockawayx.com/) to solidify the relationship as liquidity providers and users of our product suite and pave the way for a new line of institutional-grade yield products.\n\n## Background\n\nIdle DAO is on a mission to empower the DeFi credit market with robust yield automation and hedging instruments, facilitating its expansion and establishing a foundation for sustainable financial ecosystems.\n\nAt the heart of our product design, there is a much broader thesis on the shifting DeFi lending market. It is formed on the core belief that, over the coming years, the global debt activity will move on-chain, making every transaction and loan programmable and auditable – as the world’s debt moves on-chain, liquidity providers will have the essential need to manage their exposure to it.\n\nAs one of the most prominent venture capital firms backing leading Web3 funds and founders, Rockaway X is amped to back Idle DAO to achieve this mission. In tandem with [RoX Credit Fund](https://rockawayx.com/investors/funds), they will provide a robust foundation to develop Idle DAO product suite and contribute to long-term value creation by providing network, liquidity and community support.\n\nRockaway X has strategically employed Yield Tranches over the last years to effectively balance their risk and reward profile in managing institutional credit lines at the fund level. Through practical experience, they have witnessed the advantages offered by both Senior and Junior Tranches in optimizing their financial strategies.\n\nWe both recognize the nuanced risks associated with both DeFi securitizations and RWA-based loans, including traditional and novel elements. To address these challenges, our industry must develop hedging solutions. Current on-chain debt offerings often lack diversity, limiting their appeal, and the use of illiquid collateral in off-chain transactions introduces additional risk, catering only to a specific group of investors.\n\n![|624x352](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/RHibYkuf7dEBQ1UhVPHeB3DGTVIJSOlqyJ8iHZ4sNkGislHfHShoBYqLSoX0X9PMgrd6GA3o4mYu9I57l6m7vDxsqGdbSAxrLarV7fwFX44IG__DvWe08RQQ2iB0ntJ4po0X8iO43p9wmQOIeq1AvHQ)\n\nTogether, we believe that the use of securitization and tranching methods can be a catalyst to grow DeFi’s reach. The long-term plan is to create a marketplace to facilitate this, by bringing diversification to the world’s on-chain lending and borrowing activity and allowing liquidity providers to customize, leverage or hedge their yield portfolio\n\nWith the ultimate endorsement of Idle DAO and IDLE token holders, this proposal would set the stage for a wider ecosystem endeavor and give support to build a credit and yield derivatives marketplace where liquidity providers can create their very own yield portfolio.\n\n## Rationale\n\nThis agreement is part of [Idle DAO strategic treasury diversification](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-treasury-diversification-through-strategic-partners/524), as already voted and approved by IDLE token holders. The treasury diversification is intended to accelerate Idle DAO growth via more diversified liquidity management and an enhanced partner ecosystem.\n\nThis is planned to be the first instance of a series of strategic agreements with Rockaway X, which will actively participate in Idle DAO’s product suite. The reason for the strategic diversification is two-fold: enhancing the development of our yield product suite and its ecosystem and better aligning our partners long term.\n\n## Specification\n\nThis funding round provides the following:\n\n* Rockaway X will allocate 1,000,000 USDC (or other stablecoins) to Idle DAO’s Fee Treasury.\n* Idle DAO will allocate 1,733,333 IDLE from the Idle DAO’s [Long Term Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0x107a369bc066c77ff061c7d2420618a6ce31b925) to Rockaway X Vesting Contract.\n\nIDLE tokens taken from Long Term Fund will be subject to a 2-year vesting period, with 33% released after a 12-month cliff and the rest with a 12-month block-by-block linear vesting.\n\nThe initial focus of this funding round will be to expand Idle DAO Leagues with new team members to streamline product suite development, and improve market liquidity to foster a more robust ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to the funding round, Idle DAO will allocate up to 866,667 IDLE from the [Long Term Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0x107a369bc066c77ff061c7d2420618a6ce31b925) that will be distributed to Rockaway X Credit Fund according to the weighted average of the liquidity deployed across Idle DAO product suite throughout 12 months. This allocation will follow the same aforementioned vesting schedule. Details about the product, liquidity deployment, and distribution methodology for this strategic allocation will be further described and approved in a separate governance post.\n\nIf the proposal is positively voted by the Idle DAO, the Treasury and Dev League will set up the required contracts, and the initial operations for the funding round transfer via the next IIP.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAll Idle DAO stakeholders and the Ethereum community are invited to weigh in on the proposal. This proposal will be followed by a Temperature Check vote with the link published here, when ready.",

This decision was driven by multiple reasons such as the low profit margin and traction achieved in the market.\n\nOther than the Clearpool Yield Tranches, the Morpho-Aave tranches were part of the underlying yield sources of the Junior BY vaults. As a direct consequence, now missing the Best Yield showcase, it is time to discuss the future of the Morpho Aave pools.\n\nSince January 2023, the Morpho-Aave tranches have shown the following metrics on Ethereum\n| Yield Tranche |Average TVL|Average APY|\n| --- | ---: | ---: |\n|YTs DAI Senior| $2,019 | 1.92% |\n|YTs USDC Senior | $2,287 | 4.21% |\n|YTs USDT Senior | $2,535 | 2.80% |\n|YTs WETH Senior | $3,021 | 1.30% |\n|YTs DAI Junior | $5,541 | 5.53% |\n|YTs USDC Junior | $4,782 | 12.41% |\n|YTs USDT Junior | $3,722 | 9.07% |\n|YTs WETH Junior | $8,588 | 3.31% |\n\nThe Morpho tranches showed a very low level of liquidity partially driven by the yields offered and also due to the low perceived risk. \n\nFee-wise, the Morpho-Aave tranches did not generate any significant fee in the face of $1,000 spent for harvest. If we add to the equation, the costs of the security monitoring tools and maintenance, all the vaults would show a negative profit margin.\n\n## Rationale\n\nGiven the low liquidity and [fees generated](https://gov.idle.finance/t/m3-2023-performance-report/1221) by the Morpho Aave tranches and the recent closure of the Junior BY vaults, we suggest decommissioning the DAI, USDC, USDT and WETH Morpho pools. \n\nThis action will decrease the monitoring and updating effort of the Development League and also reduce the cost incurred by the DAO to pay for the harvesting activities.\n\n[...]\n\nTogether with the Morpho-Aave delisting, we also advise delisting the Senior BY WETH vault. The vault has low liquidity and currently supports only the Aave and Compound markets. After its delisting, we will relaunch the pool with an improved codebase and new yield sources.",

On the liquidity side, for example, they accounted for less than 5% of the total value locked into the Best Yield vaults. This could be partially explained by the fact that risk-seeking users seem to prefer picking precisely their yield sources and depositing instead in the Junior Yield Tranches.\n\nFee-wise, the Junior BY vaults generated ~$12,000 in fees in the face of ~$8,000 spent in rebalancing costs. If we add to the equation, the costs of the security monitoring tools and maintenance, all the vaults would show a negative profit margin. \n\n| Vault | Fees generated | Rebalance costs |\n| --- | ---: | ---: |  \n| BY DAI Junior | $3,471 | $2,413 |  \n| BY USDC Junior | $4,924 | $4,311 |  \n| BY USDT Junior | $2,955 | $1,769 |  \n| BY WETH Junior | - | $64 |\n| **Total** | **$11,350** | **$8,287** | \n\n## Rationale\n\nGiven the low liquidity and the [low fees generated](https://gov.idle.finance/t/m3-2023-performance-report/1221) by the Junior BY vaults, we suggest decommissioning the DAI, USDC, USDT and WETH markets.\n\n[...]\n\nThe Best Yield strategy is the cornerstone of Idle and this proposal doesn't want to put an end to its development. Based on data and community feedback we think that having Senior and Junior profiles on BY is unnecessary. We would then suggest keeping only the Senior (OG) strategies. We are anyway already working on new integrations and a revamped BY type and we will soon update the DAO about it.",

Similar to the preceding mandate, institutional lending pools continued to spearhead TVL growth, reflecting substantial interest from institutional players on both the supply and borrowing fronts. The allure of risk-diversification through Yield Tranches has been instrumental in this trend, leading us to unveil a series of insights that will lead to an exclusive set of Yield Tranches tailored for institutional players and strategies (more on this below).\n\nAs the DeFi landscape evolves, the financing of RWAs gains prominence, echoing a prevailing theme in recent quarters. The imperative for risk protection becomes more pronounced for the maturation of this branch of DeFi. In response, we at Idle Leagues are fully committed to constructing a marketplace that will serve as a catalyst for expansion. This initiative aims to enable risk diversification into on-chain lending and borrowing activities, empowering liquidity providers and borrowers to tailor, leverage, or hedge their yield portfolios.\n\n\n## M4-2023 Retrospective\n\nWe have been proud to announce significant integration partners, and have been evolving our product suite and DAO structure. Below a closer look at some of the key achievements of the past quarter.\n\n#### 🤝 Collabs:\n\n- [VaultCraft integrates Yield Tranches](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1735648366082580515)\n- [Amulet integrates Yield Tranches](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1737782608463806822)\n- [Yield Tranches on top of Morpho Blue markets](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1738197608516948442)\n\n#### 🧩 Product: \n\n- [MATIC rewards program for zkEVM liquidity providers](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1714686700398526946)\n- [Optimism release and Yield Tranches integration](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1717186844264206766)\n- [New Institutional Credit Yield Tranches with Wincent and Clearpool](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1724482644463755443)\n- [stkIDLE Prime Staking release](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1730256116234305780)\n\n\n## M4-2023 DAO Metrics\n\nIn anticipation of a more comprehensive analysis of the performance and metrics with the upcoming M4-2023 Performance Report, below is an overlook of the TVL and fees for Idle DAO for the past quarter:\n\n### TVL\n\nAverage TVL has been **$31.6M**, with peak of $37.1M.\n\n![M4-2023 Idle DAO TVL](upload://68rzPJ0DHMHUNGwiePvn5Yjt5P5.png)\n([Source](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/16293070/))\n\n\n\n### Fees \n**Overall $84.76k has been accrued by the product suite.** Of the aggregated fees, 94.5% is coming from Yield Tranches and 5.5% from Best Yield vaults.\n\n![image](upload://yfJ1dUkeA8J5p2KSDHMEHXvkTtM.png)\n\n![image](upload://9LNj69TKaN9EYZExZ7hWUAGckbW.png)\n\n![image](upload://sW4vLRByBIRUjLZChL9hzDLwHrc.png)\n\n\n([Source](https://dune.com/idle.finance/revenue-outlook))\n\n\n### Budget vs. actual\n\n![image](upload://ePYQCChdyNDyN2fnu2JXgLIyWXo.png)\n\nThe upcoming performance report for the last quarter of 2023 will provide a more detailed look at the balance sheet and income statement for Idle DAO. The report will give our tokenholders a better understanding of the financial health and performance of the DAO and its product suite.\n\n## Leagues M1-2024 Quarterly Goals\n\n### 1) D2S (Direct to Strategist) Yield Tranches \n\nWe believe that DeFi is, and always has been, about disintermediating financial interactions. And we also think it’s inevitable that all private debt will move on chain. All of it. The whole multi-trillion dollar market of it. \n\nFor this reason, and thanks to the insightful feedback collected among our users, we believe that Yield Tranches should achieve these goals and expand access to capital, starting from a more direct relationship between liquidity providers and borrowers/strategist.\n\nA new set of Yield Tranches based on this theme is already on the way.\n\n### 2) Risk Diversified Isolated DeFi Lending\n\nOur friends at Morpho have been building an interesting suite of [isolated lending pools](https://morpho.mirror.xyz/vPkSBEZvIoVDfx-GBOsTOvjI14bqul-PA-LMe3sBlBw) that would allow to externalize risk management and allow third-parties to curate parameters such as collateral assets, liquidation LTV, oracles, and caps.\n\nWe embrace the importance of this isolated and curated approach, yet it could be prone to risk vectors such as collateral illiquidity or parameters mismanagement. Yield Tranches would be a natural fit here to allow each MetaMorpho vault to effectively cater to a different risk profile, ending the one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n### 3) Senior Tranches Repo Markets\n\nCarrying on our collaboration with Morpho, we plan to leverage the [new Morpho Blue infrastructure](https://morpho.mirror.xyz/hfVXz323zp9CmJ1PLDL4UhdLITGQ865VIJUyvZYyMA4) to spin off a new isolated lending market for Senior Tranches tokens. This initiative borrows out from the repo markets, which are pivotal to the efficient working of almost all financial markets. \n\nEnabling Senior Tranches as collateral would result in the de-facto creation of a new class of tranches (lenders to Senior Traches-collateralized loans can be intended as \"Super Senior\" – or in a traditional nomenclature, we'd have Senior-Mezzanine-Junior classes), which would allow Senior Tranches holders to have an efficient source of short-term funding and hedge the primary debt issuance. \n\n### 4) Prime Staking Consolidation and Discount Market\n\nBy end of February 2024, we will close the pilot program for [sktIDLE Prime Staking](https://gov.idle.finance/t/prime-staking-idle-staking-v2/1222/2) and release a series of consideration and updates to finalize the stkIDLE staking module. \n\nWe plan to potentially include into the possible discount new Yield Tranches, allow stkIDLE delegation and the creation of bribes markets to get discount – the latter could be achieved via external bribe markets like Hidden Hand or Paladin.\n\n### 5) Open and Permissionless Yield Tranches\n\nGiven the numerous requests our Dev League is receiving for building Yield Tranches on top of brand new yield sources, we plan to push R&D in order to build a permissionless Yield Tranches Factory. \n\nThe Factory will be designed to offer a new trustless primitive with increased efficiency and flexibility compared to existing tranches implementations. It would aim to provide a permissionless risk management and permissionless market creation with yield source agnostic setup. Generally speaking, the Factory would be designed to be a simple, immutable, and governance-minimized base layer that allows for a wide variety of other users to built on top of it. \n\n### 6) Best Yield Update, RWA Yield Tranches, new zkEVM products, IDLE as Collateral and Further Multichain Expansion\n\nIn addition to the above new goals, we will keep developing and improving the current product suite, with a focus on upgrading the current Best Yield underlying yield sources, expanding the Yield Tranches spectrum with RWA assets (with corporate bonds as very first target), and adding a new set of Yield Tranches on zkEVM to [finalize the agreed grant](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-deployment-on-zkevm-a-multi-step-growth-plan/1156).\n\nAdditionally, we plan to improve IDLE market liquidity to push for further decentralization and allow use-cases like IDLE as collateral, and approaching new EVM-compatible L2s to expand either IDLE or Yield Tranches, considering potential strategic partnerships and user feedback, to enable our users a 360 onchain experience.\n\n\n## Leagues M1-2024 Expected Budget\n\n![image](upload://85g8141iimBSBSt0N2y2B9s4GEy.png)\n\n\n**The [expected budget for M1-2024](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w1KJkc3c6BW2N7zfmh9RCg0OcHZPdfiL3D2tTVfK9bI/edit?usp=sharing) is $94'575 in stablecoin and 83'953 IDLE (using a 20-day rolling price at the time of writing).**\n\nAt the time of writing, the [Treasury League multisig](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0xFb3bD022D5DAcF95eE28a6B07825D4Ff9C5b3814) stablecoin or equivalents holdings currently stand at $190'969 and 1'674 IDLE so if the Temperature Check for IDLE tokenholders is positive, 82'279 IDLE will be transferred from the [Ecosystem Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aa1f98523ec15932dd5faac5d86e57115571c7) via the next IIP.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAll Idle DAO stakeholders and the Ethereum community are invited to weight in on the proposal. This proposal will be followed by a Temperature Check vote with the published here, when ready. \n\nIf positive, the M1-2024 mandate (budget and goals) will be officially approved, and the budget transfer will be included in the upcoming IIP.",

      "content": "The following is an extract of the proposal posted in the Idle DAO governance forum.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal is to approve the budget and goals for Leagues M1-2024 (January to March 2024) contributors and operations, and a brief outline of the achieved milestones for M4-2023.\n\n## Background\n\nM4-2023 marked and cemented the expansion of Idle DAO's product suite into multiple chains, including Optimism and Polygon zkEVM, with an impressive 10M TVL now established in these new domains. Similar to the preceding mandate, institutional lending pools continued to spearhead TVL growth, reflecting substantial interest from institutional players on both the supply and borrowing fronts. The allure of risk-diversification through Yield Tranches has been instrumental in this trend, leading us to unveil a series of insights that will lead to an exclusive set of Yield Tranches tailored for institutional players and strategies (more on this below).\n\nAs the DeFi landscape evolves, the financing of RWAs gains prominence, echoing a prevailing theme in recent quarters. The imperative for risk protection becomes more pronounced for the maturation of this branch of DeFi. In response, we at Idle Leagues are fully committed to constructing a marketplace that will serve as a catalyst for expansion. This initiative aims to enable risk diversification into on-chain lending and borrowing activities, empowering liquidity providers and borrowers to tailor, leverage, or hedge their yield portfolios.\n\n\n## M4-2023 Retrospective\n\nWe have been proud to announce significant integration partners, and have been evolving our product suite and DAO structure. Below a closer look at some of the key achievements of the past quarter.\n\n#### 🤝 Collabs:\n\n- [VaultCraft integrates Yield Tranches](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1735648366082580515)\n- [Amulet integrates Yield Tranches](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1737782608463806822)\n- [Yield Tranches on top of Morpho Blue markets](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1738197608516948442)\n\n#### 🧩 Product: \n\n- [MATIC rewards program for zkEVM liquidity providers](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1714686700398526946)\n- [Optimism release and Yield Tranches integration](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1717186844264206766)\n- [New Institutional Credit Yield Tranches with Wincent and Clearpool](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1724482644463755443)\n- [stkIDLE Prime Staking release](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1730256116234305780)\n\n\n## M4-2023 DAO Metrics\n\nIn anticipation of a more comprehensive analysis of the performance and metrics with the upcoming M4-2023 Performance Report, below is an overlook of the TVL and fees for Idle DAO for the past quarter:\n\n### TVL\n\nAverage TVL has been **$31.6M**, with peak of $37.1M.\n\n![M4-2023 Idle DAO TVL](upload://68rzPJ0DHMHUNGwiePvn5Yjt5P5.png)\n([Source](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/16293070/))\n\n\n\n### Fees \n**Overall $84.76k has been accrued by the product suite.** Of the aggregated fees, 94.5% is coming from Yield Tranches and 5.5% from Best Yield vaults.\n\n![image](upload://yfJ1dUkeA8J5p2KSDHMEHXvkTtM.png)\n\n![image](upload://9LNj69TKaN9EYZExZ7hWUAGckbW.png)\n\n![image](upload://sW4vLRByBIRUjLZChL9hzDLwHrc.png)\n\n\n([Source](https://dune.com/idle.finance/revenue-outlook))\n\n\n### Budget vs. actual\n\n![image](upload://ePYQCChdyNDyN2fnu2JXgLIyWXo.png)\n\nThe upcoming performance report for the last quarter of 2023 will provide a more detailed look at the balance sheet and income statement for Idle DAO. The report will give our tokenholders a better understanding of the financial health and performance of the DAO and its product suite.\n\n## Leagues M1-2024 Quarterly Goals\n\n### 1) D2S (Direct to Strategist) Yield Tranches \n\nWe believe that DeFi is, and always has been, about disintermediating financial interactions. And we also think it’s inevitable that all private debt will move on chain. All of it. The whole multi-trillion dollar market of it. \n\nFor this reason, and thanks to the insightful feedback collected among our users, we believe that Yield Tranches should achieve these goals and expand access to capital, starting from a more direct relationship between liquidity providers and borrowers/strategist.\n\nA new set of Yield Tranches based on this theme is already on the way.\n\n### 2) Risk Diversified Isolated DeFi Lending\n\nOur friends at Morpho have been building an interesting suite of [isolated lending pools](https://morpho.mirror.xyz/vPkSBEZvIoVDfx-GBOsTOvjI14bqul-PA-LMe3sBlBw) that would allow to externalize risk management and allow third-parties to curate parameters such as collateral assets, liquidation LTV, oracles, and caps.\n\nWe embrace the importance of this isolated and curated approach, yet it could be prone to risk vectors such as collateral illiquidity or parameters mismanagement. Yield Tranches would be a natural fit here to allow each MetaMorpho vault to effectively cater to a different risk profile, ending the one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n### 3) Senior Tranches Repo Markets\n\nCarrying on our collaboration with Morpho, we plan to leverage the [new Morpho Blue infrastructure](https://morpho.mirror.xyz/hfVXz323zp9CmJ1PLDL4UhdLITGQ865VIJUyvZYyMA4) to spin off a new isolated lending market for Senior Tranches tokens. This initiative borrows out from the repo markets, which are pivotal to the efficient working of almost all financial markets. \n\nEnabling Senior Tranches as collateral would result in the de-facto creation of a new class of tranches (lenders to Senior Traches-collateralized loans can be intended as \"Super Senior\" – or in a traditional nomenclature, we'd have Senior-Mezzanine-Junior classes), which would allow Senior Tranches holders to have an efficient source of short-term funding and hedge the primary debt issuance. \n\n### 4) Prime Staking Consolidation and Discount Market\n\nBy end of February 2024, we will close the pilot program for [sktIDLE Prime Staking](https://gov.idle.finance/t/prime-staking-idle-staking-v2/1222/2) and release a series of consideration and updates to finalize the stkIDLE staking module. \n\nWe plan to potentially include into the possible discount new Yield Tranches, allow stkIDLE delegation and the creation of bribes markets to get discount – the latter could be achieved via external bribe markets like Hidden Hand or Paladin.\n\n### 5) Open and Permissionless Yield Tranches\n\nGiven the numerous requests our Dev League is receiving for building Yield Tranches on top of brand new yield sources, we plan to push R&D in order to build a permissionless Yield Tranches Factory. \n\nThe Factory will be designed to offer a new trustless primitive with increased efficiency and flexibility compared to existing tranches implementations. It would aim to provide a permissionless risk management and permissionless market creation with yield source agnostic setup. Generally speaking, the Factory would be designed to be a simple, immutable, and governance-minimized base layer that allows for a wide variety of other users to built on top of it. \n\n### 6) Best Yield Update, RWA Yield Tranches, new zkEVM products, IDLE as Collateral and Further Multichain Expansion\n\nIn addition to the above new goals, we will keep developing and improving the current product suite, with a focus on upgrading the current Best Yield underlying yield sources, expanding the Yield Tranches spectrum with RWA assets (with corporate bonds as very first target), and adding a new set of Yield Tranches on zkEVM to [finalize the agreed grant](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-deployment-on-zkevm-a-multi-step-growth-plan/1156).\n\nAdditionally, we plan to improve IDLE market liquidity to push for further decentralization and allow use-cases like IDLE as collateral, and approaching new EVM-compatible L2s to expand either IDLE or Yield Tranches, considering potential strategic partnerships and user feedback, to enable our users a 360 onchain experience.\n\n\n## Leagues M1-2024 Expected Budget\n\n![image](upload://85g8141iimBSBSt0N2y2B9s4GEy.png)\n\n\n**The [expected budget for M1-2024](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w1KJkc3c6BW2N7zfmh9RCg0OcHZPdfiL3D2tTVfK9bI/edit?usp=sharing) is $94'575 in stablecoin and 83'953 IDLE (using a 20-day rolling price at the time of writing).**\n\nAt the time of writing, the [Treasury League multisig](https://app.safe.global/balances?safe=eth:0xFb3bD022D5DAcF95eE28a6B07825D4Ff9C5b3814) stablecoin or equivalents holdings currently stand at $190'969 and 1'674 IDLE so if the Temperature Check for IDLE tokenholders is positive, 82'279 IDLE will be transferred from the [Ecosystem Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aa1f98523ec15932dd5faac5d86e57115571c7) via the next IIP.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nAll Idle DAO stakeholders and the Ethereum community are invited to weight in on the proposal. This proposal will be followed by a Temperature Check vote with the published here, when ready. \n\nIf positive, the M1-2024 mandate (budget and goals) will be officially approved, and the budget transfer will be included in the upcoming IIP.",

      "title": "Prime Staking - IDLE staking v2",
      "content": "The following is an extract of the proposal posted on the [Idle governance forum](https://gov.idle.finance/t/prime-staking-idle-staking-v2/1222).\n\n### Summary\n\nA proposal to present the IDLE staking version 2 - offering unique fee discounts to stakers. \n\n## Background\n\nThis summer the DAO's Leagues presented an analysis focused on updating the IDLE staking\n\n> At the time of writing, the number of staked IDLE is 1.6m ([source](https://app.idle.finance/#/stake)) vs a circulating supply of 5.4m ([source](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/idle)), i.e. ~30% of IDLE staked. The ratio of staked IDLE vs the total IDLE supply is ~12%, locked for an average of 1.8 years.\n>\n> Leagues are aware that the utility of IDLE staking should be revamped. It’s then worth discussing some old and new ideas coming from the community to have a clear view of the available options to update the current model.\n\nmultiple ideas were shared and discussed\n\n> We would like to gather the sentiment of Idle DAO toward all the proposals listed:\n>\n> 1. Pause the staking reward program for stkIDLE holders\n> 2. Introduce a performance fee discount for stkIDLE holders\n> 3. Introduce early access to new pools for stkIDLE holders\n> 4. Update Snapshot’s voting power for stkIDLE holders\n\nThe DAO voted to pause the staking reward program, i.e. proposal 1. \n\n## Rationale\n\nDuring M3-2023, Leagues continued brainstorming about the second proposal both internally and with some stakeholders\n\n2. Introduce a performance fee discount for stkIDLE holders\n\n> Fee discount: that’s the option I like more as it’s well-connected to the usage of the product suite and adds utility to it. As @william suggested, we can add a plain fee rebate/discount on the performance fee, so could be a good fit both for large LPs with fee discounts [...]\n\nThis post aims to formalize the structure of the program and then vote on it. \n\n## Fee Discount\n\n### Goals\nThis strategic initiative offers a dual advantage. Liquidity providers, integral to the protocol's revenue stream, will have the opportunity to benefit from a fee discount. At the same time, IDLE token holders will benefit from an enhanced utility for their tokens within the Idle ecosystem, potentially catalyzing heightened demand and an augmented volume of locked IDLE tokens. \n\nThis convergence of efforts aligns the objectives of diverse stakeholders in the long term and has the potential to cultivate a more dynamic and robust governance framework.\n\n### Discount Tiers\nIn the [IDLE staking update](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-staking-update/1165) post, we outlined some possible discount tiers, these may be the final ones starting from the base [performance fee](https://docs.idle.finance/products/fees) of 15%\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreib3wrnyio7fz4ytl2itdpaqceklopyooebfquqpbwo7zgjmjkir4m)\n\nThis table assumes that the IDLE tokens are staked for the longest length available, i.e. 4 years.\n\n> stkIDLE linearly decreases from the lockup date to the end date. The maximum locking period is 4 years.\n\nShorter staking periods will affect the discount applied. Following the amounts presented in the Tiers summary table above, a locking of 2 years will make T1 not applicable. Similarly, a locking of 1 year will make T1 and T2 not applicable and so on. \n\n### Beneficiaries\n\nThe discount will be applicable to the [IDLE](https://etherscan.io/token/0x875773784Af8135eA0ef43b5a374AaD105c5D39e) stakers at first. \n\nWe can then think of expanding the beneficiaries list and include other LP tokens starting from the [80-20 IDLE-USDC Balancer pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x158e0fbc2271e1dcebadd365a22e2b4dd173c0db0002000000000000000005a5) and then consider other pool such as an IDLE-WETH pool on [Liquis](https://www.liquis.app/stake). \n\nSuch LP tokens will need to match the dollar value of stkIDLE.\n\n### Methodology\n\nIdeally, users should have the staked IDLE (or equivalent LP tokens) in the same wallet that they will use to deposit into Idle pools.\n\nLeagues will manually distribute the discount in the form of the underlying tokens of the pool once a month using a dedicated dashboard for the actual matching of stkIDLE and deposits with the relative fee generated and the fee discounts. The process of discount distribution will be then automated letting users receive the discount directly in their wallet.\n\nA minimum threshold of distribution equal to $100 will be applied to avoid demanding transaction management. Undistributed discounts will be accrued and shared once the minimum threshold is met.\n\nThis methodology allows depositors to increase their locking period over time to maintain the discount tiers of interest.\n\n### Pools\n\nThe program will be initially tested for 3 months on the Yield Tranches pools (besides the Fasanara YTs, part of the [strategic agreement](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-dao-strategic-agreement-fasanara-digital/1173) with the DAO) on Ethereum. When fine-tuned, it could be expanded to the Best Yield vaults and to other chains where the Idle product suite is deployed.\n\n### Example\n\nOne example of the Clearpool Portofino DAI YTs has been detailed in the proposal and may be helpful in understanding the proposal.",

      "content": "The following is an extract of the proposal posted on the [Idle governance forum](https://gov.idle.finance/t/leagues-m4-2023-roadmap-and-m3-23-recap/1198).\n\n### Summary\nThis proposal is to approve the budget for Leagues M4-2023 (October to December 2023) contributors and operations, and a brief outline of the achieved milestones for M3-2023 (more details will be released in the upcoming M3-2023 Performance Report).\n\n## Background\nM3-2023 has been a consolidation around the product market fit that Yield Tranches are demonstrating over time. Institutional lending pools have been growing in TVL, and the interest from professional asset managers has been rising on both lending and borrowing sides. More and more institutional lenders are interested in bringing their off-chain deals into on-chain risk-diversified pools, and borrowers have been given the possibility to operate over a much wider liquidity and flexible terms.\n\nDespite a pushback on boosted pool collaboration due to a Balancer vulnerability, we amplified our security framework with an additional round of audits with Code4rena researchers and with Hypernative to automate monitoring and response ops. Icing on the cake, we have been completing a new L2 expansion plan (that we’re going to announce soon™) that would create a massive opportunity for liquidity to flow in.\n\n## M3-2023 Retrospective\nWe have been proud to announce significant integration partners and have been evolving our product suite and DAO structure. Below is a closer look at some of the key achievements of the past quarter.\n\n**Collabs**:\n* Yield Tranches zkEVM release\n* Credora Yield Tranches integration\n* Liquis incentives partnership\n* IDLE 8020 pool in Balancer\n* Hypernative monitoring integration\n\n**Product**:\n* Instadapp YTs release\n* YTs v2 security audit\n\n**IIPs**:\n* IIP-37: Fasanara strategic agreement\n* IIP-38: IDLE liquidity for AMMs\n\n## Leagues M4-2023 Quarterly Roadmap\n1. **Welcome multichain era**\nFor the next quarter, we are going to announce a series of expansion plans into other L2s – don’t want to spoil anything for the users and community, but it’s something we’re very excited about. Be on the lookout, more details are coming soon.\n\n2. **Prime staking for stkIDLE**\nWe are planning to release a revamp the stkIDLE staking module, starting from the brainstorming started in this post during the last mandate. It will involve an higher synergy between product suite users and IDLE holders, giving de facto a prime access to additional features and benefit.\n\n3. **Next stop bond market**\nAs we are in the process of horizontally expanding Yield Tranches’ underlying sources, we found an interesting feedback from users for corporate bonds – this seems to be a natural fit with Yield Tranches’ value proposition, as would allow to create segments of a pool of different bonds (ETF-like, to insulate the default risk) that are divvied up by sector, time to maturity, or other characteristics in order to be serviceable to different risk profiles.\n\n4. **Not-so-hedged option liquidity pools**\nAnother type of yield source that could be a fit for Yield Tranches is option liquidity pools: in this yield source, liquidity providers provide stablecoin collateral to the vault. This collateral is used to collateralize options that are sold to liquidity takers. Liquidity providers receive yield from the premiums of the options sold. As options are hedged by either selling options or opening other positions to shift delta to neutrality, the liquidity providers should attain uncorrelated and delta-neutral yield. However, due to various factors, the reality is that most of these option liquidity pools are in loss – this is where the Senior/Junior duality can enter into action and create diversified access to these pools, allowing liquidity providers to really hedge against their drawdown risk.\n\n5. **Give me a lever, and I shall move the world**\nWe are researching over a new form of Yield Tranches that would give users the reins to their yield. This can open up the product suite to applications like fixed yield and leveraged long yield. Either by developing an in-house solution or by collaborating with other yield trading in the space, we want allow our users to create another level of customization for their yield portfolio.\n\n## Leagues M4-2023: Expected Budget\nThe expected budget for M4-2023 is $100,275 in stablecoin and 199’100 IDLE (using a 20-day rolling price at the time of writing).\n\nThe Treasury League multisig stablecoin holdings currently stand at $144,363 and 19’369 IDLE so if the Temperature Check for IDLE tokenholders is positive, 179’731 IDLE will be transferred from the Ecosystem Fund via the next IIP. \n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreign6vxhdmwg54xav5whtmcy34e6lpbjwq7s65y3w2un7tbmqzweii)",

The USDC BY strategy can add a new yield source, besides the usual Aave and Compound, able to offer an average APY in the 5% to 10% range. Currently, [Aave](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&marketName=proto_mainnet) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/markets/USDC) offer APYs lower than 1%. This significant increase in yield can benefit current BY LPs and attract new users to the protocol.\n> 2. The USDC BY funds flowing to the Senior side of Clearpool PYTs can create a stable source of funding for the Senior tranches and consequently incentive new Junior liquidity deployments thanks to the boosted APYs available (with an expected average APY in the range of 10% to 20%).\n\n[Yield Tranches](https://docs.idle.finance/products/perpetual-yield-tranches) are live since [December 2021](https://medium.com/idle-finance/make-yield-your-own-perpetual-yield-tranches-are-live-2aef53c153d6) holding a cumulative TVL of up to $50m.\n\n### Wincent details\n\n> Wincent is a leading crypto market maker with $3B+ daily volume and 300K+ daily transactions.\n>\n> Since 2018, Wincent develops software for algorithmic trading and market analysis.\n> Our true edge lies in our talented team with experience from Google, Facebook, academia, data science, competitive programming, math and physics competitions (IOI, IMO, IPhO, ACM ICPC), sports betting and poker.\n> Our algorithms trade $300 million – $3.5 billion daily on the top cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide 24/7/365.\n\n[Clearpool (Wincent) pool](https://clearpool.finance/permissionless/pools/0xa0749f550a336b031f63bd095062204e1a56055b?market=ethereum) is live since the beginning of September. The Wincent pool has a maximum borrowing capacity of up to $27m. [Credora](https://credora.io/) rates the borrower with a BB.\n\n| Protocol | Borrower | Capacity | Pool size | Credora's rating |\n| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | :---: |\n| Clearpool | Wincent | $27,000,000 | $ - | BB |\n\nAt the time of writing, the Wincent pool has been deployed and will soon start the borrowing activities.\n\n### Risk rating\n\nThe borrower has been already analysed internally following the [risk rating framework](https://gov.idle.finance/t/risk-framework-version-1/1143/3). The Clearpool (Wincent) Yield Tranches can be considered as a valid market to become a new yield source of the Best Yield vaults. \n\nIn order to trigger any BY deployment, the Yield Tranches will need to have at least a 30% coverage on Senior funds coming from the Junior counterparty.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreifilghj6oxj73dxytsyiw2dznfho5gmh6uuqep7mlkpfuwtmjpsqe)",

Continue the Liquidity Mining program for 3 months and update the distribution rate\n>\n>Another option is to extend for another 3 months program but adjust its distribution rate.\n>\n>* From 500 to 250 IDLE/day for the next 3 months\n>\n>The IDLE needed to fund this extension can be taken from the [Ecosystem fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aa1f98523ec15932dd5faac5d86e57115571c7).\n>\n>This emission rate would affect minimally the rewards return for the BY strategy (+0.1% at current prices).\n\nThe last wave of the IDLE incentivization campaign should have ended around mid-August*. \nLeagues noted instead that the effective distribution rate was lower than the expected one and that there are still some IDLE funds available, ~76k, that can further extend the duration of the Liquidity Mining program. \n\n## Proposals\n\nWe will list three options as the next steps for the IDLE incentive program:\n\n### 1. Continue the LM program for 6 months at 250 IDLE/day\n\nThe Best Yield vaults have been incentivised through the Liquidity Mining program with different distribution rates (3205 → 2215 → 1000 → 500 → 250 IDLE/Day). One option is to continue at the last distribution rate set.\n\n- 250 IDLE/day for the next 6 months\n\nAt this distribution rate, the 76k IDLE would guarantee around 10 months of rewards distribution. Idle Leagues, anyway, suggest extending the program for 6 months and deciding later if to stop the campaign or continue until funds end. \n\nThe IDLE tokens needed to fund this extension are already present, hence there isn't a need to move any funds from the DAO treasury. From a business perspective \n\n> Extending the incentivization length of the LM program can be strategically smart to retain the current liquidity (mainly sitting in the DAI, USDC and USDT BY markets). Even more, now that the Best Yield and the Yield Tranches strategies can work synergetically.\n\n### 2. Continue the LM program for 5 months at 500 IDLE/day\n\nAlternatively, the DAO can decide to continue the liquidity mining program and also adjust the distribution rate. For example, the `idleRate` could be set back to 500 IDLE/day. \n\n- From 250 to 500 IDLE/day for the next 5 months\n\nSuch an increase would decrease the program length and increase the selling pressure on the governance token. No IDLE funds will remain after this five-month extension. \n\nThe IDLE tokens needed to fund this extension are already present, hence there isn't a need to move any funds from the DAO treasury.\n\n### 3. Pause the Liquidity Mining distribution \n\nOne last option is to pause the Liquidity Mining program, aka set the `idleRate` at zero, and use the tokens elsewhere.\n\n-   From 250 to 0 IDLE/day \n\nFrom a DAO treasury perspective, this proposal, if approved, would impact minimally the selling pressure on IDLE and instead impact the integrators working on top of Idle.\n\n—  \n\\*  For a matter of clarity, $IDLE incentives distribution happens on a per-block basis, hence some amount and calendar rounding has been applied.",

      "content": "The following is an extract of the proposal posted on the [Idle governance forum](https://gov.idle.finance/t/iip-38-idle-transfer-to-leagues/1181).\n\n### Authors\nTreasury League and Development League\n\n### Summary\nThe IIP transfers IDLE to the Treasury League multisig as part of the activities behind the launch of the IDLE 80-20 pool on Balancer.\n\n## Rationale\nAt the beginning of July, Davide published an analysis focusing on multiple improvements to IDLE tokenomics and related DEX activities. One of the proposals was the launch of an 80-20 pool on Balancer\n\n> #### 1. Launch an 80-20 Balancer pool\n> Idle DAO was one of the early adopters of the Smart Treasury, a 90% IDLE - 10% WETH pool based on Balancer v1. With the release of Balancer v2, Idle DAO discussed its composable nature for interest-bearing tokens and decided to launch the Idle Boosted Pool at the beginning of this year. […]\n> \n> The launch of an 80-20 IDLE/stablecoin pool would help foster volumes even without direct trades, as the use of a stablecoin pair would provide an alternative venue for arbitrage opportunity (with ETH price changes).\n> \n> The target stablecoin can be chosen according to the following criteria:\n> \n> * single-side assets like USDC or DAI;\n> * 3pool (DAI/USDC/USDT), which is almost unused on Balancer;\n> * Balancer Boosted Aave V3 USD (bb-a-usd), which benefits from boosted APR (2-5%) but increases swap costs;\n> * emerging stablecoins like R (or the pair R/DAI), GHO, crvUSD. There are no pools with these last two assets, thus the technical feasibility needs to be explored.\n>\n> The use of 3pool or bb-a-usd brings limited advantages, considering the stablecoin part represents only 20% of the pool’s share. The use of R would represent a potential risk for liquidity providers due to the short longevity compared to USDC/DAI, but it could expand LPs audience with a new ecosystem.\n> \n> Idle DAO can deploy a size equivalent to the liquidity locked in the Uni v3 concentrated pool (~40k), considering it would only need $8k in stablecoins.\n\nDavide also suggested using protocol-owned liquidity to incentivize the liquidity formation phase in the pool and to apply for a BAL grant\n\n> #### 2. Incentives for veBAL voters as a form of LM\n> With the launch of an 80-20 Balancer pool, Idle DAO can include ad-hoc incentives for veBAL holders to increase pool rewards. Idle Leagues are already familiar with the incentive mechanism and used it on Warden to raise up to $1.8m on the bb-i-usd.\n> \n> Considering that the current multiplier is 1.2-1.3x, this means that $1 worth of rewards would bring a higher value of AURA+BAL incentives. Idle DAO can allocate protocol-owned liquidity (POL) in the pool, swap accrued rewards into IDLE and reallocate the tokens in future incentives, generating a positive-sum return from an ecosystem perspective.\n> \n> This flywheel has two potential outcomes:\n> \n> 1. The DAO increases POL thanks to the incentive multiplier\n> 2. Other users deposit liquidity in the pool. DAO’s rewards are diluted, so lower bids are placed in the next rounds. If LPs maintain liquidity, the acquisition cost is lower. If they remove funds, we come back to the previous scenario\n> \n> The use of an 80-20 pool would reduce liquidity provision barriers for IDLE token holders, given the limited pool share of non-IDLE assets, and incentivize its decentralized nature. This activity does not generate volume directly but could help create deeper liquidity in a more efficient way. […]\n\n> #### 3. Use 80-20 Launchpad to apply for a 25k BAL grant\n> Balancer Launchpad got media coverage after a series of tweets from protocols supporting the 80-20 model. The 8020 Launchpad page states that “this program is intended to support all systems which involve the staking/locking of 8020 BPT. ve8020 is one such system and it’s a convenient shorthand to use, but this program is not limited to “ve” systems only.”\n> \n> Protocols that implement this model or equivalent on Balancer are eligible for an initial grant of 25k BAL (~$125k at the time of writing). All BAL granted through this program must be locked in veBAL, and the beneficiary will provide the 20% share of ETH (~$31k) to pair tokens and form ~$156k liquidity in 80-20 BAL/ETH pool.\n> \n> After launching a 80-20 pool, using POL to seed the pool, and placing incentives to foster liquidity provision, this grant would represent an important addition to the flywheel.\n> \n> By staking $156k in BAL/ETH liquidity for the max duration, Idle DAO will unlock 12.5k veBAL votes. Users that deposit liquidity in 80-20 IDLE/stablecoin can be entitled to choose veBAL allocation and get rewarded by other protocols interested in acquiring their votes. […]\n\nIdle DAO voted positively in launching the pool, starting an incentivization campaign and applying to the Balancer grant. Idle DAO Leagues deployed the pool and started the incentivization process on Warden. The Launchpad proposal to the Balancer DAO will be released soon and shared in our governance.\n\n* Balancer 80-20 IDLE pool [0x158e0fbc2271e1dcebadd365a22e2b4dd173c0db](https://etherscan.io/address/0x158e0fbc2271e1dcebadd365a22e2b4dd173c0db)\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe code for the IIP-38 consists of one action.\n\nIIP-38 actions:\n\n* 1 action to transfer 140,285 IDLE from the [Ecosystem Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aa1f98523ec15932dd5faac5d86e57115571c7) to the [Treasury Leagues multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFb3bD022D5DAcF95eE28a6B07825D4Ff9C5b3814)\n\nThe IDLE amount to be transferred is composed of the following entries:\n\n* 122,285 IDLE already used to seed the Balancer 80-20 pool\n* 18,000 IDLE to fund the incentivization campaign until the M3-2023 end (8 weeks).

      "title": "AMM liquidity improvements",
      "content": "The following is an extract of the proposal posted on the [Idle governance forum](https://gov.idle.finance/t/amm-liquidity-improvements/1176).\n\n## Summary\nThis research introduces some ideas to improve Idle DAO’s current allocation of protocol-owned liquidity and describes tokenomics improvements that can be applied to increase the decentralization of protocol ownership. From the launch of an 80-20 IDLE/stablecoin pool on Balancer to a 25k BAL grant application, this post recaps the state of the art of IDLE-based AMM markets and which activities can be quickly pursued to foster liquidity efficiency.\n\nThis proposal aims to increase current protocol-owned liquidity by 2x, diversify AMM venues and pools, and solidify Idle DAO’s treasury.\n\nPoints 1), 2), and 3) define a natural evolutive process, adopting the 80-20 model to make it a core infrastructure for IDLE liquidity provision.\n\n## DEX activities overview\n\n### 1. Launch a 80-20 Balancer pool\nIdle DAO was one of the early adopters of the Smart Treasury, a 90% IDLE - 10% WETH pool based on Balancer v1. With the release of Balancer v2, Idle DAO discussed its composable nature for interest-bearing tokens and decided to launch the Idle Boosted Pool at the beginning of this year. [...]\n\nThe launch of an 80-20 IDLE/stablecoin pool would help foster volumes even without direct trades, as the use of a stablecoin pair would provide an alternative venue for arbitrage opportunity (with ETH price changes).\n\nThe target stablecoin can be chosen according to the following criteria:\n\n* single-side assets like USDC or DAI;\n* 3pool (DAI/USDC/USDT), which is almost unused on Balancer;\n* Balancer Boosted Aave V3 USD (bb-a-usd), which benefits from boosted APR (2-5%) but increases swap costs;\n* emerging stablecoins like R (or the pair R/DAI), GHO, crvUSD. There are no pools with these last two assets, thus the technical feasibility needs to be explored.\n\nThe use of 3pool or bb-a-usd brings limited advantages, considering the stablecoin part represents only 20% of the pool’s share. The use of R would represent a potential risk for liquidity providers due to the short longevity compared to USDC/DAI, but it could expand LPs audience with a new ecosystem.\n\nIdle DAO can deploy a size equivalent to the liquidity locked in the Uni v3 concentrated pool (~40k), considering it would only need $8k in stablecoins.\n\n### 2. Incentives for veBAL voters as a form of LM\nWith the launch of an 80-20 Balancer pool, Idle DAO can include ad-hoc incentives for veBAL holders to increase pool rewards. Idle Leagues are already familiar with the incentive mechanism and used it on Warden to raise up to $1.8m on the bb-i-usd.\n\nConsidering that the current multiplier is 1.2-1.3x, this means that $1 worth of rewards would bring a higher value of AURA+BAL incentives. Idle DAO can allocate protocol-owned liquidity (POL) in the pool, swap accrued rewards into IDLE and reallocate the tokens in future incentives, generating a positive-sum return from an ecosystem perspective.\n\nThis flywheel has two potential outcomes:\n\n1. The DAO increases POL thanks to the incentive multiplier\n2. Other users deposit liquidity in the pool. DAO’s rewards are diluted, so lower bids are placed in the next rounds. If LPs maintain liquidity, the acquisition cost is lower. If they remove funds, we come back to the previous scenario\n\nThe use of an 80-20 pool would reduce liquidity provision barriers for IDLE token holders, given the limited pool share of non-IDLE assets, and incentivize its decentralized nature. This activity does not generate volume directly but could help create deeper liquidity in a more efficient way. This approach can be used on Convex too.\n\nIn both scenarios, Warden represents the most suitable venue to place incentives. The platform allows protocols to pay incentives only if the target pool receives votes, avoiding a blind allocation of rewards. The team has been very responsive, and they assist us in identifying the right cost/reward ratio.\n\n### 3. Use 80-20 Launchpad to apply for a 25k BAL grant\nBalancer Launchpad got media coverage after a series of tweets from protocols supporting the 80-20 model. The 80-20 Launchpad page states that “this program is intended to support all systems which involve the staking/locking of 80-20 BPT. ve80-20 is one such system and it’s a convenient shorthand to use, but this program is not limited to “ve” systems only.”\n\nProtocols that implement this model or equivalent on Balancer are eligible for an initial grant of 25k BAL (~$125k at the time of writing). All BAL granted through this program must be locked in veBAL, and the beneficiary will provide the 20% share of ETH (~$31k) to pair tokens and form ~$156k liquidity in 80-20 BAL/ETH pool.\n\nAfter launching an 80-20 pool, using POL to seed the pool, and placing incentives to foster liquidity provision, this grant would represent an important addition to the flywheel.\n\nBy staking $156k in BAL/ETH liquidity for the max duration, Idle DAO will unlock 12.5k veBAL votes. Users that deposit liquidity in 80-20 IDLE/stablecoin can be entitled to choose veBAL allocation and get rewarded by other protocols interested in acquiring their votes.\n\nAs a result, more IDLE holders are incentivized to deposit liquidity in the 80-20 IDLE/stablecoin pool and be part of this decisional process.\n\n## Other DEX activities\n\nIn the post, there are listed other initiatives that won't be fully copied here, given that the vote will be focused on the first three proposals above involving Balancer.\n\n4. Launch a pool on Convex (paired with FRAXBP)\n5. Use Arrakis PALM\n6. Launch a bond on Bond protocol\n7. Call option as a reward token\n\n## Specification\nHere are some next steps coming by this analysis and subject to this vote.\n\n* Launch an 80-20 IDLE/USDC pool on Balancer with $40k initial liquidity from DAO’s treasury and set minimum swap fees (>0.01%)\n* Place IDLE incentives on Warden to route BAL+AURA rewards to 80-20 pool (amount TBD)\n* Start the Balancer governance process to apply for a 25k BAL grant",

Idle DAO Strategic Agreement with Fasanara Digital](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-dao-strategic-agreement-fasanara-digital/1173)\n\n> This agreement is part of [Idle DAO strategic treasury diversification](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-treasury-diversification-through-strategic-partners/524), as already voted and approved by IDLE token holders. The treasury diversification is intended to accelerate Idle DAO growth via more diversified liquidity management and an enhanced partner ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal specifically formalizes the strategic agreement between Idle DAO and Fasanara Digital\n\n> As one of the first institutional borrowers onboarding into YTs, [Fasanara Digital ](https://www.fasanara.com/digital) is amped to enter into Idle DAO’s ecosystem to benefit from YT’s risk-diversified liquidity layer and participate in its improvement process, while entering in an agreement that would allow optimizing the capital efficiency of their own YTs.\n\nThe agreement will be subject to the following conditions:\n\n> * Fasanara allocating 150,000 USDC (or other stablecoins) to Idle DAO’s Fee Treasury.\n> * Idle DAO allocating 150,000 IDLE from the Idle DAO’s [Ecosystem Fund ](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aa1f98523ec15932dd5faac5d86e57115571c7) to Fasanara.\n> * Idle DAO and Fasanara entering into a fee-sharing agreement for any fee generated by any Senior or Junior Yield Tranches based on Fasanara borrowing pools, up to the amount allocated by Fasanara in Idle DAO’s Fee Treasury\n\nThe first point has already been fulfilled by Fasanara ([reference Tx](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x216f217b12f66ec9fa80d8b367b8425c60e88f3e806bb68456334e19750b8b5a)). The second point will be fulfilled by the Treasury League by sending 150,000 IDLE to the Fasanara vesting contract after the completion of this IIP.\n\n## [2.

The treasury diversification is intended to accelerate Idle DAO growth via more diversified liquidity management and an enhanced partner ecosystem.\n\nThis is planned to be a first instance of a series of strategic agreements with users and partners that actively participate in Idle DAO’s product suite. The reason for the strategic diversification is two-fold: enhancing the development of Yield Tranches and its ecosystem and better aligning our partners long term.\n\n## Specification\nThis strategic agreement provides the following:\n\n* Fasanara allocating 150,000 USDC (or other stablecoins) to Idle DAO’s Fee Treasury.\n* Idle DAO allocating 150,000 IDLE from the Idle DAO’s [Ecosystem Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aa1f98523ec15932dd5faac5d86e57115571c7) to Fasanara.\n* Idle DAO and Fasanara entering into a fee-sharing agreement for any fee generated by any Senior or Junior Yield Tranches based on Fasanara borrowing pools, up to the amount allocated by Fasanara in Idle DAO’s Fee Treasury\n\nIDLE tokens taken from Ecosystem Fund will be subject to a 2-year vesting period, with a 6 months cliff and an 18-month block-by-block linear vesting.\n\nThis agreement can be extended in the future if Yield Tranches based on Fasanara borrowing pools will gain further traction during the next months, and the allocated amount can grow up to 400,000 USDC.\n\nIf the proposal is positively voted by the Idle DAO, the Treasury and Dev League will set up the required contracts, set up the transfer via the next IIP, and monitor and execute the fee-sharing agreement.",

It also includes the pause of the staking reward program for stkIDLE holders as part of the recent discussion about IDLE staking.\n\n### References \n* [Update Best Yield USDC, USDT, WETH yield sources](https://gov.idle.finance/t/update-best-yield-usdc-usdt-weth-yield-sources/1148/2) post\n* [Clearpool YTs as a new yield source for USDC BY - Fasanara](https://gov.idle.finance/t/clearpool-yts-as-a-new-yield-source-for-usdc-by-fasanara/1166) post\n* [IDLE staking update](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-staking-update/1165) summary post\n\n## Rationale\n\n### [1. Update Best Yield WETH yield source](https://gov.idle.finance/t/update-best-yield-usdc-usdt-weth-yield-sources/1148/2)\n\nThis action will complete the process of removal of the Euler Yield Tranches as the underlying markets for the DAI, USDC, USDT and WETH vaults.\n\n> The DAO recently voted to [update the BY DAI](https://gov.idle.finance/t/update-best-yield-dai-yield-sources/1142) pool yield sources. Now we want to discuss an update of the underlying markets for the Best Yield strategies on USDC, USDT and WETH.\n>\n> > Based on internal risk assessment, we suggest to remove Euler from the basket of yield sources of the strategy at least until a new audit check is run. This market could be added again to Best Yield after a re-assessment of the newly audited Euler protocol and via an Idle DAO vote.\n\nTogether with the on-chain changes, we will also remove the strategies from the [Idle's dApp](https://app.idle.finance/#/earn/yield-tranches). Depositors have successfully completed their redeems. The agEUR still deposited were burnt by Angle Money. \n\nFrom a security perspective, it's worth mentioning that up-today the WETH Best Yield vault couldn't anyway deposit funds in the Euler underlying market, being all the Euler's strategies deactivated.\n\n### [2. Clearpool YTs as a new yield source for USDC BY - Fasanara](https://gov.idle.finance/t/clearpool-yts-as-a-new-yield-source-for-usdc-by-fasanara/1166)\n\nThis proposal aims to add new Clearpool Yield Tranches to the Senior Best Yield vaults on USDC:\n\n* [Clearpool USDC (Fasanara) YTs](https://app.idle.finance/#/earn/protected-yield/0xdca1dae87f5c733c84e0593984967ed756579bee), with specs available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Idle-Finance/best-yield-PYT-strategy/blob/master/src/Contract.sol)\n\nThe Fasanara Yield Tranches will join Aave, Compound and [Portofino YTs](https://etherscan.io/address/0x9CAcd44cfDf22731bc99FaCf3531C809d56BD4A2) as underlying markets for the USDC pool. \n\n> ### Fasanara details\n>\n> > Fasanara Digital is a quantitative investment fund applying a scientific approach to investing in cryptoassets with the aim to achieve exceptional risk-adjusted returns for its investors.\n> >\n> > Fasanara Digital was started in 2019 as part of [Fasanara Capital](https://www.fasanara.com/), a 200 people London-based hedge fund founded in 2011 that specializes in alternative credit and fintech strategies.

Pause the staking reward program for stkIDLE holders](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-staking-update/1165)\n\nMultiple proposals are being discussed on how to revamp the IDLE staking use cases. One of them has already been voted and can continue the on-chain voting process:\n\n* Pause the staking reward program for stkIDLE holders\n\n> Currently, stakers are rewarded with a mechanism that distributes half of the fees generated (in IDLE) by the Senior Best Yield strategy.

The USDC BY strategy can add a new yield source, besides the usual Aave and Compound, able to offer an average APY in the 5% to 10% range. Currently, [Aave](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&marketName=proto_mainnet) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/markets/USDC) offer APYs lower than 1%. This significant increase in yield can benefit current BY LPs and attract new users to the protocol.\n> 2. The USDC BY funds flowing to the Senior side of Clearpool PYTs can create a stable source of funding for the Senior tranches and consequently incentive new Junior liquidity deployments thanks to the boosted APYs available (with an expected average APY in the range of 10% to 20%).\n\n[Yield Tranches](https://docs.idle.finance/products/perpetual-yield-tranches) are live since [December 2021](https://medium.com/idle-finance/make-yield-your-own-perpetual-yield-tranches-are-live-2aef53c153d6) holding a cumulative TVL of up to $50m.\n\n### Fasanara details\n\n> Fasanara Digital is a quantitative investment fund applying a scientific approach to investing in cryptoassets with the aim to achieve exceptional risk-adjusted returns for its investors.\n>\n> Fasanara Digital was started in 2019 as part of [Fasanara Capital](https://www.fasanara.com/), a 200 people London-based hedge fund founded in 2011 that specializes in alternative credit and fintech strategies.

      "content": "### Summary\n\nA proposal to discuss the Operating Agreement of the Idle DAO LLC.\n\n### References\n\n* [Idle DAO incorporation in the Marshall Islands](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-dao-incorporation-in-the-marshall-islands/1155) governance post\n* [MIDAO website](https://www.midao.org/)\n\n### Background\n\nAfter the positive feedback received from our community regarding the intention of incorporating the Idle DAO in the Marshall Islands\n\n> Finally, we came up with a solution that should help our DAO have a formal legal wrapper without adding too many legal burdens. The selected solution aims to incorporate the DAO in the Marshall Islands with a not-for-profit structure supported by the MIDAO.\n\nWe have kept working with legal advisors and today we can present a step forward in the incorporation of our DAO: the Operating Agreement of Idle DAO LLC. \n\n## Operating agreement\n\nThe Operating Agreement of Idle DAO LLC, which can be read fully [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tnKBJLVPbY2mSlhI6EuphyfkY7zCYDc9/view?usp=share_link), is composed by twelve articles as follows:\n\n1. Organization\n2. Purposes and powers\n3. Members\n4. Right and duties of members\n5. Algorithmic management\n6. Accounting and records\n7. Contributions and capital accounts\n8. Dissociation of a member\n9. Admission of additional members\n10. Dissolution\n11. Amendment\n12. Miscellaneous provisions\n\nThe document contains also two appendices that summarize\n\n* The DAO's Treasury wallets, as listed in [Idle's documentation](https://docs.idle.finance/governance/idle-dao/treasury)\n* The DAO's Governance processes, as described in [Idle's documentation](https://docs.idle.finance/governance/idle-dao/governance-process)\n\nFollowing the Marshall Islands legislation, we will need to pick a **Beneficiary Owner** that will sign this operating agreement and be the first point of contact with the local officers. Leagues sponsor @Biaf to take this responsibility given his long and positive experience as a DAO core contributor.\n\n### Next steps\n\nWe encourage the community to thoroughly read the Operating Agreement document and share any feedback on this. If there won't be any requests for adjustments or changes, we will start the usual off-chain voting process.",

Lastly, Harvesting Vaults remove farming inefficiencies and optimize AMM LPing.\n\nProposed activities are planned to be completed in less than four months.\n\n[...]\n\n## Proposal\n\n[...] There are two main development working areas, each with its own scope and tech specifications. Considering how fast market needs and trends evolve in crypto, Idle DAO will have the flexibility to dynamically rank working areas according to market priorities and ecosystem updates.\n\n### 1. Activities related to Yield Tranches\n* identify an underlying yield source compatible with Yield Tranches infrastructure\n* integrate targeted protocol into Yield Tranches\n* deploy Tranches infrastructure and integrated protocol in zkEVM\n* launch zkEVM support on Idle website and integrate released Yield Tranches\n\nActivities related to Ecosystem Development can amplify the outcome, such as the deployment of Balancer Boosted pool that uses Yield Tranches as underlying yield source. Similarly, the onboarding of high-yield protocols like Clearpool would create the highest grade of financial sustainability without external incentives.\n\n### 2. Activities related to Harvesting Vault, a new zkEVM-native primitive\n* identify a yield source compatible with Harvesting Vaults\n* develop, peer review, and test Harvesting Vaults factory\n* integrate targeted protocol into Harvesting Vault\n* integrate released Harvesting Vaults into Idle website\n\nAll activities are expected to be completed in less than four months since the parties agree on this plan.\n\nThese product releases are reinforced by business and communication activities, such as:\n\n* focus marketing and social media activities on promoting zkEVM as the reference L2 chosen by Idle;\n* engage with Idle ecosystem partners to foster protocol/liquidity deployments and design new integrations;\n* engage with institutional investors to bootstrap and grow zkEVM liquidity;\njoin AMAs/Spaces hosted by Polygon or zkEVM partners;\n\nThe budget request is 125k $MATIC, with no transfer required from Polygon team because Idle DAO already controls these funds. The remaining funds will be used to maximize the traction of released products, and their allocation will be mutually agreed between the Idle and Polygon teams.\n\nWhen activities assigned to a working area are completed, 50% of the budget request is unlocked and assigned to Idle DAO.\n",

However, we remain optimistic about the future and continue to stay focused on our mission to revolutionize the financial industry. \n\nThat said, looking at our ecosystem, we experienced a challenging March due to the Euler hack, which caused a delay in the release of this report. However, we were able to [recover all the funds](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1646831912546099200), and we made all users and partners whole. Our team worked with Euler tirelessly to ensure that the situation evolved in the best possible way, and we are grateful for their dedication and hard work.\n\nAs always, at Idle DAO, we are fully committed to helping update the financial system by building non-custodial structured yield products that expand the utility and adoption of DeFi. We believe that DeFi is a technology that can make the World's financial fabric more equitable and accessible to anyone.\n\n\n## M1-2023 Retrospective\n\n[As reported and planned in the M1-2023 milestones](https://gov.idle.finance/t/leagues-m1-2023-milestones-m4-2022-recap/1099), we have been proud to announce significant integration partners, and have been evolving our product suite, capped off by the release of the brand new Senior & Junior Best Yield vaults. \n\nBelow a closer look at some of the key achievements of the past quarter:\n\n- [**Shapeshift Best Yield and Yield Tranches dashboard integration**](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1612499866160087040) \n- [**Sense Junior stETH Yield Tranches integration for fixed yields**](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1603802351122481152) \n- [**Swissborg Earn Junior stMATIC Yield Traches integration**](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1618550396779204613) \n- [**Morpho USDC/USDT/DAI Senior/Junior Yield Tranches release**](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1620813737589444608) \n- [**New Senior/Junior Best Yield vaults release**](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1621181932200501248) \n- [**New Stats page for idle.finance dashboard release**](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1628824106236891137) \n- [**Boosted Pool on top of Junior Best Yield vaults with Balancer release**](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1631339192708997131) \n\n## M1-2022 DAO Metrics\n\nWhile there will be a more comprehensive analysis of the performance and metrics for M3 with the upcoming M3 Performance Report, below is a quick overlook of the TVL and fees for Idle DAO:\n\n### TVL\nAverage TVL has been $54.1M (-11.3% wrt M4-2023) thought M1-23, with $84.2M peak.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ndDSaa4.png)\n\n\n\n### BY & PYTs Fees \nOverall $67k has been accrued by the product suite. Of the aggregated fees, 84.2% is coming from PYTs and 15.8% from BY strategies.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4wLkIpf.png)\n\n### Budget vs. actual\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FBtfQ3Y.png)\n\n\n\n\nThe performance report for the current period will be released in the coming days, providing a more detailed look at the balance sheet and income statement for Idle DAO. This report will give our tokenholders a better understanding of the financial health and performance of the DAO and its product suite.\n\n## Leagues M2-2023 Quarterly Goals\n\n### 1) Provide risk diversification to a wider yield spectrum\n\nLooking ahead to the next quarter, our goal at Idle DAO is to provide risk diversification to a wider yield spectrum with Yield Tranches. Our aim is to create a set of structured products that would allow users to customize their yield portfolio based on their preferred risk/reward ratio. \n\nOur experience tells us that investors in DeFi have unique risk management requirements, which is why we have been working tirelessly to develop a solution that satisfies these needs. We believe that this will provide a much-needed solution to help bring more users into the DeFi space and contribute to the overall growth of the industry.\n\nYield sources that we believe are a great fit for Yield Tranches' risk diversification and which we will be focusing on are:\n- **Autocompounding boosted AMMs strategies**\n- **Leveraged/folding yield strategies**\n- **Delta neutral yield strategies**\n- **Uncollateralized/RWA-based lending strategies**\n\n\n\n### 2) Expand Best Yield vaults and Yield Tranches to L2s\n\n\nAs we look to the future, Idle DAO is committed to building a multichain product suite that provides users with access to the best yield opportunities in different L2s. We believe that the future of DeFi will be built on execution layers (L2s) that interface with a consensus layer (Ethereum), and we see many opportunities for DeFi users in different L2s. However, moving assets across chains is highly costly and time-consuming, which limits the opportunities available to users. \n\n**To address this challenge, we are expanding our Best Yield vaults and Yield Tranches to EVM-based L2s as the first step towards a multichain future for our product suite.**\n\nBy having multiple instances of our products in different L2s and leveraging account abstraction, we aim to make it instant for our users to access the best yield opportunities without worrying about choosing a chain or bridging assets. Our goal is to create a user experience that is easier, quicker, more accessible, and more secure than ever before, allowing users to pick the yield strategies that work best for them without the complexity of managing different chains.\n\n### 3) Idle DAO LLC\n\nFinancial centers around the world are starting to enact clear rules with the objective of becoming crypto hubs from a legal standpoint. As a DAO, we are well-positioned to play a significant role in this new chapter of DeFi. We are committed to proactively participate in the conversation and are confident that our expertise will enable us to thrive in this new environment.\n\nAs mentioned in a [recent post](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-dao-incorporation-in-the-marshall-islands/1155), the entity of choice will be an RMI DAO LLC. The Republic of the Marshall Islands is a unique country with several key advantages:\n\n- Sovereign, internationally-recognized state \n- Strong, respected judicial institutions \n- Stability as a Freely Associated State of the US \n- Fast-moving, adaptable legislative process that can keep up with evolving markets\n\nCrucially, the RMI also strongly supports innovation. The country recently passed a law that enables DAOs to incorporate as LLCs with bylaws and membership that can be recorded on the blockchain. This fits all of our criteria.\n\nIn this way, Idle DAO would be incorporating within the current global regulatory framework and being able to capitalize on two legal benefits — limited legal liability and corporate personhood. \n\n\n\n## Leagues M2-2023 Expected Budget\n\n**The expected budget for M2-2023 is $163,183 in stablecoin and 86,942.43 IDLE (with 20-day rolling price at the time of writing).**\n\nCurrent Treasury League multisig stablecoin holdings currently stand at $68,223 so, if the Temperature Check for IDLE tokenholders will be positive, $94,960 will be transfered from the [Idle DAO Fee Treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x69a62c24f16d4914a48919613e8ee330641bcb94) via the next IIP. No need to transfer any IDLE at the current time.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/2RgCYTM.png)\n\n\n\n## Next Steps\n\nThis post is open for feedback and can be voted via this Temperature Check. If positive, the M2-2023 mandate will be officially approved and the budget transfer will be included in the upcoming IIP-35.\n\n",

      "content": "The following is an extract of the proposal posted on the [Idle governance forum](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-dao-incorporation-in-the-marshall-islands/1155). \n\n### Author\n\nTreasury League\n\n### Summary\n\nA proposal to incorporate the Idle DAO in the Marshall Islands using MIDAO. \n\n### References\n\n* [Legal structure for the Idle DAO](https://gov.idle.finance/t/legal-structure-for-the-idle-dao/682) post - Sept 2021\n* [Idle DAO Legal Structure - Summary](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-dao-legal-structure-summary/898) post - Jan 2022\n* [Idle DAO Legal Structure - Governance Proposal](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-dao-legal-structure-governance-proposal/901) post - Jan 2022\n* [MiDAO website](https://www.midao.org/)\n\n## Background\n\nThe research to incorporate the Idle DAO has been an argument of discussion\n\n> **DAO legal structure**: despite using a nonverbose approach, we’ve been continuing to pursue research for the DAO legal structure; the environment for DAOs has been continually changing over the last year, and won’t be likely stopping for the year ahead as well. The currently available structures can create more constraints than benefits (both on DAO level and operational level); so the sentiment is to pursue a leaner structure in the short term, that would allow DAO contributors to legally contribute. And for the long-term, with more legal clarity over DAOs (which we hope and will strive to be proactive with regulators to make it for 2023), we will re-evaluate to wrap the entire DAO.\n\nWe want to thank @Salome and @David_M_Kerr in particular for their analyses and the community for the useful insights.\n\nFinally, we came up with a solution that should help our DAO have a formal legal wrapper without adding too many legal burdens. The selected solution aims to incorporate the DAO in the Marshall Islands with a not-for-profit structure supported by the MIDAO. \n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreif3rhtdft5h2qwvw3xxxi7ho6whl4pdzf7mew5nkf2qnrkuwzfaqy)    \n\n## MIDAO RMI DAO LLC\n\nIncorporating Idle DAO with [MiDAO](https://www.midao.org/) will benefit the community under multiple aspects:\n\n1. **Limited Liability**\nIncorporating the DAO is the best way to shield contributors and token holders from legal risks. This ensures every DAO member can keep his assets and future earnings even if the DAO is sued or under a legal crisis.\n2. **Corporate Personhood**\nIncorporating the DAO will give our organization the possibility to act as an individual entity, enter into traditional agreements and own assets. \nIf our DAO needs to open a bank account to manage fiat currencies, it’s impossible unless we establish corporate personhood. And, if Leagues sign contracts and interact with third-party companies outside of the blockchain, the contracts don’t hold up under the law without corporate personhood.\n3. **Tax Entity**\nIdle DAO does not have a tax entity making it more difficult to manage taxes for the DAO and its contributors. A MIDAO DAO LLC will protect IDLE token holders with respect to any DAO-related tax burden.\n\nAdditional benefits include \n\n* No trustees, directors, officers, or managers with extra liability or responsibility\n* All documents and records can be kept on the blockchain\n* ﻿Most members can remain anonymous\n*  Governance by smart contract is allowed by law\n\n### Expenses\n\nThe cost associated with this proposal is expected to be a one-time payment of $20,000 used to pay MIDAO, legal advisors and the costs associated with the initial entity filing. This amount will cover budgeted expenses until January 2025. ",

A summary follows:\n\n* Distribution 1 - 3205 IDLE/Day distributed between Best Yield (70%) and Yield Tranches (30%)\n* Distribution 2 - 1990 IDLE/Day distributed between Best Yield  (50%) and Yield Tranches (50%)\n* Distribution 3 - 500 IDLE/Day distributed on Best Yield\n\n## Financial analysis\n\nTo understand the financial performance of the incentives program, it can be useful to understand the dollar cost, aka the acquisition cost, of the fees generated by the Idle strategies for every $IDLE incentive distributed.\n\n> How many fees were generated by the Idle strategies vs the $ amount of IDLE distributed?\n\nWe have already analysed two different distribution periods:\n\n* Distribution 1 from 01/01/2021 until 08/06/2022 with 3,205 IDLE/day\n* Distribution 2 from 08/07/2022 until 12/31/2022 with 1,990 IDLE/day\n\nToday we will add a third part\n\n* Distribution 3 from 01/30/2023 until 13/03/2023 with 500 IDLE/day\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreids2bvrzjrldzhcsgosf6tjyvmi7b5onxr2w3ywjfnm3srp3z3wsm)    \n\n**Distribution 3**\nThe Best Yield strategy received around 21k $IDLE incentives, i.e. 47% of the funds, (for an average dollar value of $9k with IDLE price equal to $0.42) and generated around $22k in fees for the DAO.\n\n* For every $1 spent in $IDLE incentives, the BY strategies generated $2.49 in fees\n\nThese results seem to suggest that the incentivization program for Best Yield is strategic and helped retain the TVL. We should anyway weigh this analysis taking into consideration its short length. Due to the Euler exploit that happened on March 13th, multiple strategies were paused. Hence the analysis lasts only ~40 days.\n\n## Proposals\nWe will list three ideas as the next steps for the Liquidity Mining program:\n\n### 1. Continue the Liquidity Mining program for 3 months\nThe Best Yield strategy has been incentivised through the Liquidity Mining program with different distribution rates (3205 → 2215 → 1000 → 500 IDLE/Day). One option is to extend for another 3 month the program at the same distribution rate.\n\n* 500 IDLE/day for the next 3 months\n\nThe IDLE needed to fund this extension can be taken from the Ecosystem fund.\n\nExtending the incentivization length of the LM program can be strategically smart to retain the current liquidity (mainly sitting in the DAI, USDC and USDT BY markets). Even more, now that the Best Yield and the Yield Tranches strategies can work synergetically.\n\nThis emission rate would not affect the rewards return for the BY strategy (+0.2% at current prices).\n\n### 2. Continue the Liquidity Mining program for 3 months and update the distribution rate\nAnother option is to extend for another 3 months program but adjust its distribution rate.\n\n* From 500 to 250 IDLE/day for the next 3 months\n\nThe IDLE needed to fund this extension can be taken from the Ecosystem fund.\n\nThis emission rate would affect minimally the rewards return for the BY strategy (+0.1% at current prices).\n\n### 3. Pause the Liquidity Mining distribution\nOne last option is to pause the Liquidity Mining program.\n\n* From 500 to 0 IDLE/day\n\nFrom a DAO treasury perspective, this option would stop the emission of IDLE and reduce significantly the selling pressure on the DAO governance token. The emission rate would affect the rewards return for the BY strategy and stakers.\n\nIt is important to remember that the Liquidity Mining program started in November 2020 with different rates of distributions and strategies affected.\n\nThe DAO may also think to update the Integration Partners program and create an ad-hoc solution for integrators that count on the additional return given by IDLE on the Idle strategies.",

Now we want to discuss an update of the underlying markets for the Best Yield strategies on USDC, USDT and WETH.\n\n> Based on internal risk assessment, we suggest to remove Euler from the basket of yield sources of the strategy at least until a new audit check is run. This market could be added again to Best Yield after a re-assessment of the newly audited Euler protocol and via an Idle DAO vote.\n\nThe primary goals in relation to the affected strategies, i.e. Senior and Junior BY on USDC, USDT and WETH and the Euler YTs, are as follows:\n\n> * **Ensure a secure recovery process for users of Senior and Junior Yield Tranches**. The current Euler Senior/Junior Yield Tranches will be deprecated upon allowing all depositors to redeem their funds. […]\n> * **Ensure continuity of Best Yield vaults**. Despite the recent challenges with Euler, Senior and Junior Best Yield vaults will continue to operate as usual. The funds recovered from Euler and sent to Senior/Junior Best Yield vaults will be rebalanced across Compound/Aave/Morpho/Clearpool (accordingly to the underlying yield sources of each Best Yield vault) to maintain optimal performance.\n\nThis proposal is at the foundation of the process to go back to normal activity and re-open the paused products. Recovered amounts will be redistributed across all the respective strategies, allowing users to regain access to standard deposit and redeem operations and reboot all strategies’ functionalities.",

[Credora](https://credora.io/) rates the borrower with an A.\n\n| Protocol | Borrower | Capacity | Pool size | Credora's rating |\n| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | :---: | \n| Clearpool | Portofino | $24,300,000 | 962,740 | A |\n\nAt the time of writing, the Portofino pool provides 16.55% APR with an 81% utilization rate ([source](https://app.clearpool.finance/pool/0x4a90c14335e81829d7cb0002605f555b8a784106?market=ethereum)).\n\nFollowing the new version of the [**risk rating framework**](https://gov.idle.finance/t/risk-framework-version-1/1143/3), the Clearpool (Portofino) Yield Tranches can be considered as a valid market to become a new yield source of the Best Yield strategies. \n\nIn order to trigger any BY deployment, the Yield Tranches will need to have at least a 30% coverage on Senior funds coming from the Junior counterparty.

The [fees generated](https://dune.com/queries/2023794) in the last 2 years on top of this market were minimal (~$300). \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibq4x3wsfqju3koig2eo33ps53gp3ibzg6fa23fqbv5jjsqp73yj4)\n\nThe wBTC token won’t be anymore listed in the main UI under Best Yield, and deposits will no longer be available. Users will still be able to redeem their funds from either the [beta version of our dashboard](https://beta.idle.finance/) or by interacting with the contracts on [Etherscan](https://docs.idle.finance/developers/best-yield/deployed-contracts).\n\nThis initiative aligns with the end goal to simplify the Idle product offering. Based on market demand, in the future, we may think to tranche a wBTC market with our PYT primitive or include this market in the leveraged strategies.",

The USDC BY strategy can add a new yield source, besides the usual Aave and Compound, able to offer an average APY in the 5% to 10% range. Currently, [Aave](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&marketName=proto_mainnet) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/markets/USDC) offer APYs lower than 1%. This significant increase in yield can benefit current BY LPs and attract new users to the protocol.\n>2. The USDC BY funds flowing to the Senior side of Clearpool PYTs can create a stable source of funding for the Senior tranches and consequently incentive new Junior liquidity deployments thanks to the boosted APYs available (with an expected average APY in the range of 10% to 20%).\n\nCurrently, the [Euler DAO is discussing](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-51-update-eul-distribution-scheme/664/9) to extend the duration of the EUL incentives distribution indefinitely to its staking markets with the following specs:\n\n|Token\t| EUL distribution | \n| ---  | --- |\n| eWETH\t| 9,000 per epoch |\n| eUSDC\t    | 5,000 per epoch | \n| eUSDT\t    | 1,000 per epoch |\n\nThe Euler DAI staking PYTs will benefit from the [Peg Stability Model (PSM)](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/governance/module-psm/) of Maker DAO to swap 1:1 DAI to USDC and enjoy indirectly the staking rewards distributed by Euler DAO.\n\n### Euler details\nEuler hit the mainnet in [December 2021](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/euler-finance-launches-defi-lending-141124672.html). Euler’s Perpetual Yield Tranches are live since [June 2022](https://medium.com/idle-finance/euler-pyts-next-gen-risk-adjusted-lending-markets-e00891109fb7).\n\n> Euler is a non-custodial permissionless lending protocol on Ethereum that helps users to earn interest on their crypto assets or hedge against volatile markets without the need for a trusted third party.\n>\n> Euler protocol features a number of innovations not seen before in DeFi, including permissionless lending markets, reactive interest rates, protected collateral, MEV-resistant liquidations, multi-collateral stability pools, and much more.\n\nFrom the security perspective, Euler has been committed to develop various safe mode measures and introduced the [Oracle Risk Grading System](https://blog.euler.finance/eulers-oracle-risk-grading-system-93f47d68205c). This mechanism empowers Euler DAO to enable lending and borrowing on any ERC-20 token thanks to Uniswap v3 TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price). The risk system estimates the oracle manipulation cost, allowing tokens to unlock specific functionalities (e.g. collateral) only above a certain security score.",

From the previous budget, reported at the beginning of [Jan 2023](https://gov.idle.finance/t/leagues-m1-2023-milestones-m4-2022-recap/1099), the Idle Leagues will assume a new expected budget and cost structure for M1. \n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiflqmzp6c2qith4hq2wpmnpn66fmoau4nifptd6lwnoazg4m4dbaa)\n\nThe new Leagues' monthly burn rate becomes $43,300 in stablecoins or equivalents and 19,898 in $IDLE (with a 20-day rolling average price).\n\nTaking into account that Jan 2023 won’t be covered via the Treasury League multisig, at the current time there’s no need to move additional funds to the Treasury League multisig to fund M1’s new cost structure. \n\nAs part of this new budget, we gave significant consideration to the continued economic health of the DAO and the variety of tokens requested, consequently cutting Idle Labs’ burn rate by 25%. If the treasury health and diversification will improve and take place, we will reserve the possibility of reviewing the cost structure via another proposal.",

      "content": "The following is an extract of the proposal posted on the [Idle governance forum](https://gov.idle.finance/t/iip-31-idle-incentives-distribution-update-euler-staking-pyts-as-new-yield-sources-for-by/1107).\n\n### Authors\nTreasury League and Development League\n\n### Summary\nThis proposal focuses on two initiatives\n\n1. IDLE incentives distribution update\n2. Euler staking PYTs as new yield sources for BY\n\n## Rationale\n### 1. IDLE incentives distribution update\n\nFor a comprehensive analysis of the initiatives, we suggest visiting the related [governance post](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-incentives-distribution-update-v2/1104). \n\nThe DAO voted in favour of two proposals linked to the incentivization programs on IDLE\n\n>#### 1. Continue the Liquidity Mining program\n>\n>The Best Yield strategy has been incentivised through the Liquidity Mining program with different distribution rates (3205 → 2215 → 1000 IDLE/Day). We suggest continuing its incentivization but also decreasing its distribution rate.\n>\n>* From 1000 IDLE/day to 500 IDLE/day for the next 3 months\n>\n>The IDLE needed to fund this extension can be taken from the [Ecosystem fund ](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aa1f98523ec15932dd5faac5d86e57115571c7).\n\nDuring the discussion we pointed out how a reduction of the daily distribution to the BY strategy together with a program extension could have multiple benefits: \n\n* retain the current Best Yield's liquidity (mainly sitting in the DAI, USDC and USDT markets)\n* reduce significantly the selling pressure on the DAO governance token\n\nThe second proposal discussed, focused on the incentivization mechanism behind the Perpetual Yield Tranches, i.e. the Gauges system\n\n>#### 2. Pause the Gauges distribution\n>\n>The Perpetual Yield Tranches have been incentivised through the Gauges system for over ten months at a constant distribution rate of 990 IDLE/day. We suggest pausing this distribution.\n>\n>* From 990 IDLE/day to 0 IDLE/day.\n\nThe main reason to pause the distribution of the Gauges system is related to the composability issues faced by partners when integrating Idle's strategies.\n\n>The performances of the Gauges distribution for PYTs are encouraging, but we see side disadvantages that made us think to pause the rewards on this strategy. Specifically, the Gauges architecture breaks composability with integrators calling for ad-hoc solutions and increases the effort needed to ship new partnerships. Due to this composability issue, integrators are benefitting only minimally from the rewards distributed to the Tranches.\n\nWe will then move 45,000 IDLE from the Ecosystem fund, change the daily distribution rate on BY from 1000 to 500 IDLE/day and pause (0 IDLE/day) the distribution on the PYTs' Gauges. \n\nThe Gauges system implemented will anyway stay in place and can be re-activated in the future if the DAO agrees.\n\n### 2. Euler staking PYTs as new yield sources for BY\n\nFor a comprehensive analysis of the initiatives and a background on Euler, we suggest visiting the related [governance post](https://gov.idle.finance/t/euler-staking-pyts-as-new-yield-sources-for-by/1105).\n\nThe DAO voted to upgrade the yield sources of the USDC, USDT and WETH Best Yield vaults. \n\n>Today we want to open the discussion on some new integrations: the **[Euler staking](https://app.euler.finance/staking)** PYTs\n>\n>* [Euler staking (Senior) PYTs for the USDC, USDT and WETH markets](https://app.idle.finance/#/earn/protected-yield), with specs available on GitHub [here ](https://github.com/Idle-Labs/idle-tranches/blob/master/contracts/strategies/euler/IdleEulerStakingStrategy.sol)\n\nSimilar to previous integrations, Euler staking ones would benefit doubly the Idle ecosystem\n\n1. Increase BY's returns for the USDC, USDT and WETH vaults.\n2. Add a stable source of funding to the Euler staking Senior tranches and consequently incentivize the onboarding of new Junior liquidity.\n\n>Currently, the Euler staking markets offer the following returns\n>\n>|Token|Supply APY|Staking APY|Base APY|\n>| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n>|eWETH|1.59%|1.96%|3.55%|\n>|eUSDC|1.84%|4.24%|6.08%|\n>|eUSDT|2.05%|2.84%|4.89%|\n>\n>We could then expect to have Senior PYTs returns in the 2-3% range.\n\nWe will then add the Senior tranches of Euler staking PYTs as new yield sources for the idleUSDC, idleUSDT, idleWETH Best Yield vaults.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe code for the IIP-31 can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Idle-Finance/idle-proposals/blob/main/scripts/iip-31.ts) and consists of six actions.\n\nIIP-31 actions:\n\n* 1 action to set the PYTs Gauges distribution rate to 0\n* 1 action to transfer 45k IDLE from the [Ecoysystem Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aa1f98523ec15932dd5faac5d86e57115571c7) to the [`idleController`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x275DA8e61ea8E02d51EDd8d0DC5c0E62b4CDB0BE)\n* 1 action to set the new distribution rate of the Liquidity Mining program in the [`idleController`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x275DA8e61ea8E02d51EDd8d0DC5c0E62b4CDB0BE) to 0.0698324 IDLE per block, i.e. 500 IDLE/day\n* 3 actions to add the Euler staking wrappers to the idleUSDC, idleUSDT and idleWETH BY vaults.\n\nWhere the Euler staking (Senior) PYTs wrappers addresses are:\n  \n* Euler staking USDC AA PYTs  `0x6C1a844E3077e6C39226C15b857436a6a92Be5C0` \n* Euler staking USDT AA PYTs `0xAB3919896975F43A81325B0Ca98b72249E714e6C` \n* Euler staking WETH AA PYTs `0xC24e0dd3A0Bc6f19aEEc2d7985dd3940D59dB698`",

The USDC BY strategy can add a new yield source, besides the usual Aave and Compound, able to offer an average APY in the 5% to 10% range. Currently, [Aave](https://app.aave.com/reserve-overview/?underlyingAsset=0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48&marketName=proto_mainnet) and [Compound](https://compound.finance/markets/USDC) offer APYs lower than 1%. This significant increase in yield can benefit current BY LPs and attract new users to the protocol.\n>2. The USDC BY funds flowing to the Senior side of Clearpool PYTs can create a stable source of funding for the Senior tranches and consequently incentive new Junior liquidity deployments thanks to the boosted APYs available (with an expected average APY in the range of 10% to 20%).\n\nCurrently, the Euler staking markets offer the following returns\n\n|Token|Supply APY|Staking APY|Base APY|\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|eWETH|1.59%|1.96%|3.55%|\n|eUSDC|1.84%|4.24%|6.08%|\n|eUSDT|2.05%|2.84%|4.89%|\n\nWe could then expect to have Senior PYTs returns in the 2-3% range.\n\nEuler hit the mainnet in [December 2021](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/euler-finance-launches-defi-lending-141124672.html). Euler’s Perpetual Yield Tranches are live since [June 2022](https://medium.com/idle-finance/euler-pyts-next-gen-risk-adjusted-lending-markets-e00891109fb7). Given the decrease in pure lending rates, the Euler markets on Idle did not get a strong market interest. We see this proposal, also, as a way to invest in a partnership we value.\n\n### Euler details\n\n> Euler is a non-custodial permissionless lending protocol on Ethereum that helps users to earn interest on their crypto assets or hedge against volatile markets without the need for a trusted third party.\n>\n> Euler protocol features a number of innovations not seen before in DeFi, including permissionless lending markets, reactive interest rates, protected collateral, MEV-resistant liquidations, multi-collateral stability pools, and much more.\n\nFrom the security perspective, Euler has been committed to develop various safe mode measures and introduced the [Oracle Risk Grading System](https://blog.euler.finance/eulers-oracle-risk-grading-system-93f47d68205c). This mechanism empowers EulerDAO to enable lending and borrowing on any ERC-20 token thanks to Uniswap v3 TWAP (Time Weighted Average Price). The risk system estimates the oracle manipulation cost, allowing tokens to unlock specific functionalities (e.g. collateral) only above a certain security score.\n\n### Euler staking details\n\nWith [eIP-24](https://forum.euler.finance/t/eip-24-update-the-eul-distribution-scheme/462) of November 2022, the Euler DAO decided to modify the [EUL distribution](https://docs.euler.finance/eul/distribution-1) and incentivize the [staking](https://docs.euler.finance/eul/staking) markets of the USDC, USDT, and WETH markets.\n\n> For the duration of the three-month trial, 5000 EUL a month (for a total of 15000 EUL) will be distributed to users staking these assets: USDT, USDC and WETH. To stake an asset and receive some of the EUL being distributed, users should stake their [eTokens](https://docs.euler.finance/developers/getting-started/architecture#etoken-less-than-greater-than-dtoken-symmetry) into the staking contract.\n\nEuler’s staking contract is based on Synthetix’s staking contracts. There is no lockup period: hence users can unstake their tokens anytime and claim the accrued EUL up to that moment.\n\n> While these eTokens are held in the staking contract, users should be aware that they cannot collateralise loans. You cannot borrow against tokens that are earning these EUL in the staking contract.",

      "content": "The following is an extract of the [proposal posted on the Idle governance forum](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-incentives-distribution-update-v2/1104).\n\n### Summary\nA proposal to discuss the next steps of the $IDLE incentivization programs ending in early 2023: the Liquidity Mining program for the Best Yield strategy and the Gauges distribution for the Perpetual Yield Tranches.\n\n## Proposals\nWe will list two ideas as the next steps for the IDLE incentive programs:\n\n### 1. Continue the Liquidity Mining program\nThe Best Yield strategy has been incentivised through the Liquidity Mining program with different distribution rates (3205 → 2215 → 1000 IDLE/Day). We suggest continuing its incentivization but also decreasing its distribution rate.\n\n* From 1000 IDLE/day to 500 IDLE/day for the next 3 months\n\nThe IDLE needed to fund this extension can be taken from the Ecosystem fund.\n\nExtending the incentivization length of the LM program can be strategically smart to retain the current liquidity (mainly sitting in the DAI, USDC and USDT BY markets). Even more, now that the Leagues are working to leverage the synergies between the Best Yield and the Perpetual Yield Tranches.\n\n> ### Keep evolving BY+PYTs\n> The first chapter of BY+PYTs evolution has been written with the introduction of Clearpool pools into Best Yield strategies – our long-term vision for the product suite is to create different layers of yield automation/aggregation via BY on top of a plethora of PYTs. The idea is to provide different layers of yield, and these different layers would allow different user profiles to access DeFi yield and customize their yield experience.\n\nThis emission reduction would affect the rewards return for the BY strategy (from the current +0.4% to +0.2% at current prices). Nonetheless, we see this decrease as minimal and easily overcome with the soon-to-be-released new strategies under the aggregation layer of the BY.\n\n> ### New underlying strategies for PYTs+BY yield spectrum\n> To fulfil what was mentioned above, we already have an expected yield roadmap for the next strategies we want to integrate. We already have some strategies in pipeline, which are:\n>\n> * Euler staking PYTs: this would allow to create a potentially higher yield for USDC, DAI and USDT and can be later integrated into BY to increase APYs on that product line as well.\n> Generalized leveraged strategies: it allows to supply and borrow assets (potentially USDC/DAI/USDT/ETH/stETH) on Compound v2 & v3/Aave v2 & v3/Euler/Morpho and simultaneously earn rewards.\n\nFrom a DAO treasury perspective, this proposal, if executed, would cut by half the daily emission of IDLE and reduce significantly the selling pressure on the DAO governance token.\n\n### 2. Pause the Gauges distribution\nThe Perpetual Yield Tranches have been incentivised through the Gauges system for over ten months at a constant distribution rate of 990 IDLE/day. We suggest pausing this distribution.\n\n* From 990 IDLE/day to 0 IDLE/day.\n\nThe performances of the Gauges distribution for PYTs are encouraging, but we see side disadvantages that made us think to pause the rewards on this strategy. Specifically, the Gauges architecture breaks composability with integrators calling for ad-hoc solutions and increases the effort needed to ship new partnerships. Due to this composability issue, integrators are benefitting only minimally from the rewards distributed to the Tranches.\n\nWe should remember that the majority of Idle’s TVL comes from integrators, hence creating a smoother onboarding process could be beneficial in the long term.\n\nOnce again, we think that the IDLE return loss will have a subtle effect thanks to the new smart strategies that we expect to perform better than the underlying yield that the strategy is tranching. We expect to see Senior returns higher than the Base APYs.\n\nAdditionally, the Gauges system is prone to inefficiencies such as the agEUR case. The agEUR PYTs receive ~30% of the current IDLE emission, though, they do generate almost zero fees for the DAO.\n\nThe Gauges system implemented will anyway stay in place and can be re-activated in the future if the DAO agree. We may think to discuss its re-activation at the end of the 3 months extension for the BY rewards.",

The recent CeFi debacles only serve to strengthen our resolve and drive us to continue pushing the envelope in this space.\n\n## Leagues M1-2023 Quarterly Goals\n### Keep evolving BY+PYTs\nThe first chapter of BY+PYTs evolution has been written with the introduction of Clearpool pools into Best Yield strategies – our long-term vision for the product suite is to create different layers of yield automation/aggregation via BY on top of a plethora of PYTs. The idea is to provide different layers of yield, and these different layers would allow different user profiles to access DeFi yield and customize their yield experience.\n\nFrom top to bottom, users/integrators can use fully aggregated Senior/Junior Best Yield strategies to access full-spectrum yields, without bothering to chose the exact yield source or managing rebalances across underlying protocols; on the middle-level, we have the thematic verticals: this is where both users/integrators and sophisticated LPs meet; these tranches are made up of a broad portfolio of individual yield sources and can help reduce the risk that comes with deploying liquidity into a single one. It would provide the foundation or starting point for a diversified portfolio, with one-stop exposure to a given segment of the market. Lastly, we have the plethora of segregated PYTs, that would allow sophisticated liquidity providers to compose their own yield portfolio and build up their own preferred risk-reward ratio.\n\nFor M1-2023, we are going to focus on building the segregated pools layer and, when we see a fit, we will be moving up to the other layers.\n\n### New underlying strategies for PYTs+BY yield spectrum\nTo fulfil what was mentioned above, we already have an expected yield roadmap for the next strategies we want to integrate. We already have some strategies in the pipeline, which are:\n\n* Euler staking PYTs: this would allow to create a potentially higher yield for USDC, DAI and USDT and can be later integrated into BY to increase APYs on that product line as well.\n* Generalized leveraged strategies: it allows to supply and borrow assets (potentially USDC/DAI/USDT/ETH/stETH) on Compound v2 & v3/Aave v2 & v3/Euler/Morpho and simultaneously earn rewards.\n\nPending further technical feasibility review, more yield simulations, and feedback from the customer base, some other yield strategies which are currently on the radar are:\n\n* Gearbox PYTs leveraged credit account\n* FRAX Lend Best Yield\n* GMX/dYdX/Panoptic/other PYTs with delta-neutral strategies\n\n### Tokenomics & DAO Structure\n* IDLE liquidity mining: the current IDLE emission on BY and PYTs (latter via Gauges) will end soon (approx end of Jan 2023); we will follow up in the next week with a proposal to update the current liquidity mining program to make it more efficient for both liquidity providers and tokenholders perspectives.\n* DAO legal structure: despite using a nonverbose approach, we’ve been continuing to pursue research for the DAO legal structure; the environment for DAOs has been continually changing over the last year, and won’t be likely stopping for the year ahead as well. The currently available structures can create more constraints than benefits (both on DAO level and operational level); so the sentiment is to pursue a leaner structure in the short term, that would allow DAO contributors to legally contribute. And for the long-term, with more legal clarity over DAOs (which we hope and will strive to be proactive with regulators to make it for 2023), we will re-evaluate to wrap the entire DAO.\n* Governance mining: we will release, in Jan 2023, a report that analyses the last 6-months of the program to understand its efficiency with regards to vote participation, governance forum activity and other DAO metrics; based on the results and the feedback from tokenholders, we will decide how to stir the program to continue improving the DAO activity.\n\n## Leagues M1-2023 Expected Budget\nThe expected budget for M1-2023 is in total $53’900: $28’590 in stablecoin and 68’739 IDLE (with 20-day rolling price) – current Treasury League multisig holdings can cover these expenses, so no IIP is required at the current time.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreihbphf266f424d4xsjvwh6dxrfpxzpkvm6hvydf6mwvor2wgzdo7y)",

The IIP-29 didn’t reach the quorum to be executed on-chain.\n\n### Authors\n\nTreasury League and Development League\n\n### Summary\n\nThis proposal focus on three initiatives:\n\n1. Delist RAI, SUSD, TUSD and FEI from the Best Yield strategy and from the IDLE liquidity mining distribution.\n2. Update the yield sources of the Best Yield strategy: remove the Senior Clearpool USDC PYTs and the Senior Clearpool DAI PYTs from the idleUSDC BY and idleDAI BY respectively.\n3. Update the Governor voting delay following the Immenufy bug bounty.\n\n## Rationale\n\n### 1. Delist RAI, SUSD, TUSD and FEI from the BY strategy and from the IDLE LM distribution\n\nFor a comprehensive analysis of the initiative, we suggest visiting the related governance forum posts\n\n* Strategies revamp: unused assets wind down → [Forum post ](https://gov.idle.finance/t/strategies-revamp-unused-assets-wind-down/1055)\n* Strategies revamp: unused assets wind down II → [Forum post ](https://gov.idle.finance/t/strategies-revamp-unused-assets-wind-down-ii/1090)\n\n> Both BY and PYTs strategies require a good deal of ongoing bandwidth to ensure users have a quality experience. Idle Leagues have been monitoring the performances of the strategies (as reported in the [M2-22 report](https://2235025969-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-Lw-v0NTae0RVW1spR9R%2Fuploads%2F2ATYYtmXa6X6sRUxMkqG%2FM2-2022%20Performance%20Report.pdf?alt=media&token=bb721bc4-d4ff-44bb-990c-f1a80510225c)), and due to low profit margins or other externalities (eg [FEI dissolution](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-121-proposal-for-the-future-of-the-tribe-dao/4475)) we decided to keep in the main dashboard only the strategies with the most traction and efficiency.\n\n> Following the recent decision of the Aave’s community (see [Aave’s AIP-121](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=121))\n>\n> […]\n>\n> We plan to update the assets listed in the Idle Best Yield accordingly, i.e. remove sUSD and RAI.\n>\n>In addition, we plan to delist TUSD tokens.

Update the yield sources of the Best Yield strategy\n\nThrough [IIP-26](https://gov.idle.finance/t/iip-26-clearpool-pyts-as-a-new-yield-source-for-by-wintermute/1057/3) and [IIP-27](https://gov.idle.finance/t/iip-27-clearpool-pyts-as-a-new-yield-source-for-by-folkvang/1079/11), Idle DAO approved the Clearpool Senior PYTs as new yield sources, in addition to Aave and Compound, for the BY’s USDC and DAI markets\n\n> IIP-26 actions:\n>\n> * Add Senior tranche of cpWIN-USDC PYT as a new yield source for idleUSDC Best Yield strategy\n>\n> Together with the above action, IIP-26 will set a new wrapper contract for the Clearpool USDC pool: `0xdb1b149177b5819cf467ad6519cf55416789300a`\n\n> IIP-27 actions:\n>\n> * Add Senior tranche of cpFOL-DAI PYT as a new yield source for idleDAI Best Yield strategy\n>\n> […]\n>\n> Together with the above action, IIP-27 will set a new wrapper contract for the Clearpool Folkvang DAI pool: `0x67e78ED1cC4732816816A62F2e99CDC5CfaAc06E`\n\nFollowing the FTX collapse, both borrowers, i.e. Wintermute for the USDC market and Folkvang for the DAI one, fully repaid their loans to reduce their market exposure (i.e. utilization rate = 0%).\n\nRemoving these two markets from the Best Yield strategies yield source base will reduce computational complexity and gas costs in managing the allocation, harvesting and movement of funds. These markets could be later added again to the Idle Best Yield if the utilization rate will increase.\n\n### 3. Update the Governor voting delay following the Immenufy bug bounty.\n\nA white hacker discovered a very low vulnerability on a parameter of the [`GovernorBravo` contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3D5Fc645320be0A085A32885F078F7121e5E5375) and reported it to [Immunefy](https://immunefi.com/bounty/idlefinance/). We will then update one parameter to increase the Governor voting delay, after a proposal is launched, from 1 to 100 blocks.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe code for the IIP-29 can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Idle-Finance/idle-proposals/blob/iip-29/scripts/iip-29.ts) and consists of seven actions\n\nIIP-29 actions:\n\n* 4 actions to delist four idleTokens from IDLE BY distribution: RAI, SUSD, TUSD and FEI\n* 1 action to remove cpWIN from idleUSDC BY\n* 1 action to remove cpFOL from idleDAI BY\n* 1 action to increase the Governor voting delay from 1 to 100 blocks (Immunefy bounty)\n\nThe following BY tokens will be removed from the [`IdleController`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x275DA8e61ea8E02d51EDd8d0DC5c0E62b4CDB0BE):\n\n* idleRAI - [`0x5C960a3DCC01BE8a0f49c02A8ceBCAcf5D07fABe`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf52cdcd458bf455aed77751743180ec4a595fd3f)\n* idlesUSD - [`0xF52CDcD458bf455aeD77751743180eC4A595Fd3F`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf52cdcd458bf455aed77751743180ec4a595fd3f)\n* idletUSD - [`0xc278041fDD8249FE4c1Aad1193876857EEa3D68c`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc278041fdd8249fe4c1aad1193876857eea3d68c)\n* idleFEI - [0xb2d5CB72A621493fe83C6885E4A776279be595bC](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb2d5CB72A621493fe83C6885E4A776279be595bC)\n[/quote]\n\n### Next Step\n\nThe temperature checks for the idleTokens removal have already been voted. Consequently, we won’t open a new temperature check to vote on the GovernorBravo fix and the Clearpool markets removal.

      "content": "### Summary\n\nThis proposal focus on one key initiative:\n\n* Remove part of the listed tokens from Idle Best Yield: RAI, SUSD, TUSD.\n\n## Rationale\n\nFollowing the recent decision of the Aave's community (see [Aave’s AIP-121](https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=121))\n\n> A proposal to make parameter changes on Aave V2 ETH. Given that the market situation of these assets is currently volatile, out of an abundance of caution, we recommend temporarily freezing the following markets:\n>  […]\n> * sUSD\n> * RAI \n\nWe plan to update accordingly the assets listed in the Idle Best Yield, i.e. remove sUSD and RAI. \n\nIn addition, we plan to delist TUSD token. These three assets have never reached a sufficient level of traction to justify the rebalance costs incurred by Idle DAO’s smart contracts. \n\nThis initiative aligns with the previous proposal to delist FEI and other PYTs tokens. \n\n> Both BY and PYTs strategies require a good deal of ongoing bandwidth to ensure users have a quality experience. Idle Leagues have been monitoring the performances of the strategies (as reported in the [M2-2022 performance report](https://2235025969-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-Lw-v0NTae0RVW1spR9R%2Fuploads%2F2ATYYtmXa6X6sRUxMkqG%2FM2-2022%20Performance%20Report.pdf?alt=media&token=bb721bc4-d4ff-44bb-990c-f1a80510225c)), and due to low-profit margins or other externalities (e.g. [FEI dissolution](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tip-121-proposal-for-the-future-of-the-tribe-dao/4475)) we decided to keep in the main dashboard only the strategies with the most traction and efficiency.\n\nThese four tokens won’t be anymore listed in the main UI under Best Yield, and deposits will no longer be available. Users will still be able to redeem their funds from either the [beta version of our dashboard](https://beta.idle.finance/) or by interacting with the contracts on [Etherscan](https://docs.idle.finance/developers/networks-and-codebase/ethereum-mainnet).",

      "content": "The following is an extract of the [proposal posted on the Idle governance forum](https://gov.idle.finance/t/leagues-m4-22-milestones-m3-recap/1061).\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal is to approve the budget for Leagues M4 (October to December 2022) contributors and operations, and a brief outline of the achieved milestones for M3 (more details will be released in the upcoming M3 Performance Report).\n\nIn M3, Idle Leagues have been through a deep restructuring designed to navigate the current challenging market conditions. We are at a turning point in Idle DAO evolution. We need to let our operational runway keep pace with DAO spending, and it’s the first goal we want to reach. TVL and DAO fee inflow will be our main metrics for the next mandate. While we’re in hard times, I’m pretty excited to see the coming releases that the teams have been preparing during M3 and will be released in M4.\n\n## Leagues M4 Quarterly Goals\n### BY+PYTs evolution\nWith IIP-26, the first step of the Best Yield evolution is completed. This integration will provide ~5% APY to the funds rebalanced in Senior PYTs while maintaining a high-security profile because of the 1:1 match with Junior PYTs liquidity (thus covering 100% of funds in Senior PYTs). All completely automated with the BY rebalance mechanism.\n\nThis is getting closer to the vision of an overarching Best Yield: DeFi users would just need to commission these robo-yield-funnels to automatically and non-custodially move their funds to whoever is offering the best rates, offering simplified access to different underlying protocols (overcollateralized/undercollateralized lending, liquid staking, leveraged/folding strategies, options vaults, …) while abstracting the user from the complexity and manual execution.\n\n### Dashboard Redesign\nLeagues have been working hard to complete the dashboard redesign in M3, and now it’s undergoing an internal feedback session to fine-tune it. The new dashboard will be faster and more intuitive to use while improving the available information for strategies/staking/tools.\n\nThe design phase was finalized in September, and we’re now into dashboard development. The current release date is set for late October - early November 2022.\n\n### New PYTs Underlying Yield Sources\nPYTs have been accumulating more and more traction during M3, and it will be the bedrock for new yield sources for our Best Yield strategy as well. Thus, the Dev League will be focusing on completing and deploying new PYTs on top of new yield sources during M4, such as:\n\n* **Euler Folding**: the idea behind folding is to lend capital, borrow from it and then re-supply the borrowed assets to profit from governance tokens rewards which can offset the borrowing cost. We expect this strategy can drastically improve the yield for Euler-based PYTs, and it’s scalable for all the assets available in Euler. This strategy also comes up with an off-chain bot designed to harvest the strategy each time the optimal borrowing amount changes significantly, and a profitable opportunity cost arises. This strategy obviously bears liquidation risk (other than smart contract risk), thus Senior holders would be able to hedge it while Junior holders can boost their yield in exchange of taking up this risk.\n\n* **stMATIC**: Similarly to stETH PYTs, this strategy will create Senior/Junior tranches on top of stMATIC, allowing to earn staking MATIC rewards for block validation while segmenting smart contract and slashing risk. The current base Lido APY is sitting at 6.3%, but it will soon be announced an LDO reward program for liquidity providers in collaboration with Shard Labs.\n\n* **Uncollateralized Lending Protocols**: With Clearpool PYTs, we made the first step toward risk-hedging uncollateralized loans: these new PYTs allow liquidity providers to access the emerging DeFi uncollateralized loan market with senior and junior risk-adjusted profiles. We are planning to keep building new instances of Clearpool PYTs (ie, with other borrowers in addition to Wintermute) and add other undercollateralized lending protocols to the already available PYTs infrastructure (eg Ribbon Lend).\n\n### Infrastructure & Integrations\nDuring M4, we will be building more infrastructural improvements for PYTs (like ERC4626-ready PYTs) and finalize integration with other protocols like\n\n* **Alchemix adapter**: build, review and implement an adapter for PYTs into Alchemix, allowing collateral for alUSD to be deployed into Clearpool Senior PYTs.\n* **Shapeshift**: finalize the integration of our BY and PYTs strategies into Shapeshift dashboard.\n* **Balancer Boosted Pool with PYTs**: collaborate with Balancer team to deploy a Boosted Pool based on PYTs strategies, bringing the best of both worlds to LPs and Balancer users.\n* **PYTs as collateral**: keep collaborating and building adapters to allow protocols (like Angle for agEUR) to use PYTs as collateral to mint stablecoins and improve capital efficiency for PYTs liquidity providers.\n\n### Kick-off stkIDLE Gauges Flywheel\nNow that the stkIDLE Gauges integration in Hidden Hand is finally live, the Treasury League will be preparing the ground for new partners to use incentives in order to reward stkIDLE holders for their vote in specific Gauges.\n\n## Leagues M4 Expected Budget\nThe expected budget for M4 is $22’125 in stablecoin and 80’625 IDLE – **current Treasury League multisig holding can cover these expenses, so no IIP is required at the current time.**\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiabftqge7rgilvehua57pv375piehwv5ixe2u4ufx2dp4lv6kvg7y)\n",

This significant increase in yield can benefit current BY LPs and attract new users to the protocol.\n\n- The USDC BY funds flowing to the Senior side of Clearpool PYTs can create a stable source of funding for the Senior tranches and consequently incentive new Junior liquidity deployments thanks to the boosted APYs available (with an expected average APY in the range of 10% to 20%).\n\nPerpetual Yield Tranches are live since December 2021 holding a cumulative TVL of up to $50m. Clearpool (Wintermute) pool 1 is open since May 2022 and it has been part of the PYTs offering since July 2022. The USDC Wintermute pool has a size of $18m with an average utilization rate of 85%.

      "content": "The following is an extract of the [proposal posted on the Idle governance forum](https://gov.idle.finance/t/clearpool-pyts-as-a-new-yield-source-for-by/1056).\n\n### Summary\nA proposal to add Clearpool USDC Senior tranches as a new yield source for the idleUSDC Best Yield strategy.\n\n[...]\n\n## Proposal\nLeagues (cheers to our devs) have worked on this and today we would like to discuss the first new yield source integration to the Best Yield strategy:\n\n* [Clearpool USDC (Wintermute) PYTs](https://app.idle.finance/#/tranches/clearpool/USDC), with specs available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Idle-Finance/best-yield-PYT-strategy/blob/master/src/Contract.sol)\n\nBy integrating Clearpool USDC (Senior) tranches as a new yield source for the USDC BY strategy, we can create a two-side benefit for the Idle protocol:\n\n1. The USDC BY strategy can add a new yield source, besides the usual Aave and Compound, able to offer an average APY in the 5% to 10% range.\n\n  Currently, Aave and Compound offer APYs lower than 1%. This significant increase in yield can benefit current BY LPs and attract new users to the protocol.\n\n2. The USDC BY funds flowing to the Senior side of Clearpool PYTs can create a stable source of funding for the Senior tranches and consequently incentive new Junior liquidity deployments thanks to the boosted APYs available (with an expected average APY in the range of 10% to 20%).\n\n[Perpetual Yield Tranches](https://docs.idle.finance/products/perpetual-yield-tranches) are live since [December 2021](https://medium.com/idle-finance/make-yield-your-own-perpetual-yield-tranches-are-live-2aef53c153d6) holding a cumulative TVL of up to $50m. [Clearpool (Wintermute) pool](https://app.clearpool.finance/pool/0xCb288b6d30738db7E3998159d192615769794B5b?market=mainnet) is open since May 2022 and it has been part of the PYTs offering since [July 2022](https://medium.com/idle-finance/the-rise-of-risk-hedging-uncollateralized-loans-clearpool-pyts-36d92b343c47). The USDC Wintermute pool has a size of $18m with an average utilization rate of 85%. Wintermute has a borrowing capacity on Clearpool of up to $760m.\n\n### Clearpool details\n\nClearpool developed an [interest curve mechanism](https://medium.com/clearpool-finance/new-interest-curve-mechanism-9a1a5191977f) that encourages borrowers to optimally utilize liquidity in their pools while increasing lenders’ compensations.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibbvex7afysct4jre3vfvfjwxbewb2qfdsklfnl6bgbgk2dpxex5a)\n    \n\nClearpool’s smart contracts have been developed to incorporate a number of [safety measures](https://docs.clearpool.finance/clearpool/how-it-works/protocol/default) which protect both borrowers and lenders during black swan events. Clearpool’s pools have a default mechanism based on each pool utilization rate which forces borrowers to repay loans if the pool’s utilization rate is too high.\n\n|Utilization rate|Pool status|Time limit|\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|< 95%|Active|No time limit|\n|> 95%|Warning|Until UR = 99% or < 95%|\n|> 99%|Provisional default|120 hours|\n\nThe underlying yield generated by Clearpool is mainly composed of organic lending returns, limiting APY dilution with liquidity growth.\n\nCurrently, Wintermute pool provides 9% APY with an 80% - 85% utilization rate ([source](https://app.clearpool.finance/pool/0xCb288b6d30738db7E3998159d192615769794B5b?market=mainnet)). Thanks to Clearpool’s first-of-its-kind formula, APYs can be maintained stable by high pool utilization up to borrower capacity - equal to $746m for the Wintermute pool.",

He also presented a Leagues restructure plan aiming to reduce Leagues expense and asked for the M3-2022 budget.\n\n> […] Counting July as M2 rewards, and August/September with the revised M3 rewards, we get to a required budget of $36k in stables or eq, and 88k IDLE.\n\n$IDLE incentives distribution update → [Forum post]((https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-incentives-distribution-update/1030))\n\nI have analysed the $IDLE incentives programs (Liquidity Mining program for BY and the Gauges system for PYTs) and shared some proposals to address the $IDLE’s distribution strategy challenges:\n\n1. Adjust $IDLE incentive distribution\n2. Gauges distribution adjustment\n3. Best Yield deployment into Senior PYTs\n4. Governance mining\n\nThis IIP focuses on the first 2 points.\n\n> We would like to propose a change to the daily $IDLE distribution rate (currently at ~3200 $IDLE/day) by decreasing it to ~2000 $IDLE/day. This change would affect mainly the Best Yield strategy (Liquidity Mining program) and incidentally the Perpetual Yield Tranches (Gauges distribution) and can be summarized as follows\n\n* Liquidity Mining program (Best Yield strategy): 2,215 → 1000 $IDLE/day\n* Gauges system (Perpetual Yield Tranches): 990 $IDLE/day\n\nThe updated distribution rates would let us increase the length of both incentivization programs up to early February 2023.\n\nSpecifications\nThe code for the IIP-25 can be found [here](https://github.com/Idle-Finance/idle-proposals/commit/fd6c88e599bd5b01ea5a109d2e54b29c4d330797).\n\nIIP-25 actions:\n\n* Transfer $IDLE from IdleController to the Gauge Distributor\n* Set the new distribution rate for the Liquidity Mining program (i.e. Best Yield incentives)\n* Transfer of funds to the Treasury League Multisig for the M3-2022 budget\n   * 99.8 stkAAVE from the Fee Collector\n   * 5.5 WETH from the Fee Treasury\n   * 39.7 COMP from the Fee Treasury\n   * 1467 USDT from the Fee Treasury\n   * 1007 DAI from the Fee Treasury\n\nThe length of the Gauge Distributor’s distribution should update automatically with the new $IDLE received.\n\nWe will open the voting pools right after the publication of this post.",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] – $IDLE incentives distribution update",
      "content": "A proposal to discuss a change to the $IDLE incentivization emission through the Liquidity Mining program and the Gauges system.\n\n[...]\n\n## Proposals\nWe will list four ideas to address the $IDLE’s distribution strategy challenges:\n\n### 1. Adjust $IDLE incentive distribution\nWe would like to propose a change to the daily $IDLE distribution rate (currently at ~3200 $IDLE/day) by decreasing it to ~2000 $IDLE/day. This change would affect both the Best Yield strategy (Liquidity Mining program) and the Perpetual Yield Tranches (Gauges distribution) and can be summarized as follows\n\n* Best Yield strategy: 2,215 → 1000 $IDLE/day\n* Perpetual Yield Tranches: 990 $IDLE/day\n\nThe updated distribution rates would let us increase the length of both incentivization programs up to early February 2023. The following tables show a comparison of the current monthly distribution vs a preview of the updated distribution after July 2022.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifwpr4yly4bewqaatqgfrbrnh4ruuhsyc527fk735rfjbweal5t4y)\n   \n### 2. Gauges distribution adjustment\nA distribution of $IDLE incentives through Gauges can better attract new users to the Idle ecosystem. The Gauges mechanism lets the community choose which pool to reward most every week.\n\nThe DAO can also leverage the use of Gauges for partnership reasons, increasing the gauge weight of a specific pool together with partners. The most significant example of DAO 2 DAO collaboration in this sense is the strategic partnership with Lido.\n\nThe $IDLE gauges incentive distribution to Senior PYTs should end in early October according to the initial timeframe set. We would suggest increasing its length to match the updated Liquidity Mining program duration, i.e. February 2023.\n\n* Perpetual Yield Tranches: 990 $IDLE/day\n\nOne of the goals of the next mandate will be to fully leverage Voters’ Extractable Value (VEV) potential. We do expect an increase of interest by partners and the community to interact with the Idle Gauge system. There is already a discussion going on for the $IDLE listing on VeToken Finance, while other partners, such as Angle Money, are ready to incentivize manually Idle stakers’ Gauges votes.\n\nIn addition, the Gauges mechanism’s nature does promote an increase of $IDLE staking, aligning the interests of new depositors to the ones of long-term IDLE token holders.\n\n### 3. Best Yield deployment into Senior PYTs\nThanks to the Senior PYTs integration into the BY strategy, the reduction in the incentive distributed to the BY wouldn’t affect too much the final return for users.\n\nIdle Finance has always shown APYs on its dashboard split between the underlying return and the incentives one, integrators, on the contrary, show APYs coming from Idle as a sum of the two, i.e. underlying + $IDLE yields.\n\nTo hedge partially the consequences of a change of the distribution rate on Idle integrators’ APYs, Idle DAO will start deploying some of the BY funds into the Senior PYTs pools. Besides adding a new yield source, the BY strategy will be able to offer higher yields by leveraging the higher APYs generated by the PYTs underlying, as well as meet the high-security standards of the BY strategy with the built-in protection mechanism of Senior PYTs.\n\n### 4. Governance mining\nInstead of distributing governance tokens only to liquidity providers, we can share part of the tokens based on Governance contributions in proportion to protocol impact. The underlying assumption here is that contributors, those who put time and effort into the protocol, are much more aligned with the long-term success of the protocol than yield farmers.\n\nIdle DAO has just released a Governance Mining program. In the proposal presented by @emixprime, we set some guidelines to reward contributors with a high impact on the DAO governance.",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] – Leagues M3 Structure, Goals & Budget",
      "content": "## Revised Leagues Structure and Workflow\n\n### Leagues Contributor Brackets & Work Ethic Code \n\nHR is a super complex process, let alone doing it in the “open”. Circumstances and personal situations are harder to reflect on in a context of a diverse DAO. As such, it’s likely easiest to have approximate brackets - and then allow some ad-hoc stuff on the margins by allowing for some small degree of subjectivity given a contributor’s background. This can, later on, be decided by an actual HR League as Idle DAO grows. For now, the brackets reflect general market demand & complexity for each role (while being an oversimplification, of course) and make it more transparent between the DAO members and contributors on who gets what.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiecquxjx7o2xzbz4rhdqctcqqkua7vcaiineqlfplm7j2yswegjzy)\n \n### Transparent work process & reporting\n\nThe Leagues contributors will commit to mandate reports. The reports will be shared and completed by contributors on a monthly or bi-monthly (in case activity is lower) basis and will be on a Notion public page.\n\n### Accountability: self-reporting and max hourly compensations\n\nIt should be noted that one can’t practically self-report a 100 hour week (despite devs doing that and beyond) simply because the discussions on “why X task took you so much time” would become very problematic as the DAO scales. It would be too subjective. As such, the maximum of a salary as per the above screenshot - is really the maximum unless there are some extraordinary circumstances.\n\nAt the end of the month, every contributor can quote how much they have been busy with certain tasks. Most of the roles have concrete activities so it would be fairly easy to understand how much time one or the other task could have taken. But just to be sure, a few Discord messages and a couple of tweets can’t justify even a 25% capacity. Common sense should be exercised.\n\n### Keeping full flexibility for everyone involved\n\nThe above rewards match similar roles outside of the crypto world, whereas here there is also extra IDLE. These IDLE rewards will be vested to create an extra incentive for a contributor to work more and stay aligned with the success of the protocol. Contributors are not required to be online 24/7 and can pursue their other hobbies or projects. As such, there is no need for hard control of KPIs and such - which is practically impossible in the context of a DAO anyway. While those would be great to do, for non-dev roles it’s extremely subjective and unclear. Dev capacity in most cases is expected to be at 100% minus the normal days off or force majeure sickness/partying.\n\nFor example, lack of motivation or lack of available work from a contributor will make it seamless for them to rotate out and not feel stressed. Meanwhile, strong motivation will result in full USDC compensation and extra IDLE tokens vested for the same $ value as the work dedicated to Idle DAO and Leagues that given month.\n\n---\n\n## Leagues M3 Structure, Goals & Budget\n\n### M3 Leagues formation: the Contributors League\n\nWhile Leagues have been evolving a LOT during the last 1.5 years, expanding and shrinking depending on the needs/phase of the DAO and its product suite, we are adopting a \"do more with less\" approach. The contributors and the treasury need to scale back to a number that can manage multiple subDAOs without high operational overhead. As such, the current group together with founding members become more on the operational side, whereas we will spin back off multiple subDAOs later on or help manage subDAOs that grow out in the future. That is for the next hiring wave.\n\nThese actions and the revised budget and cost restructure, as reported below, will be implemented in August to **reduce Leagues expenses by -60%** [compared to M2 budget](https://gov.idle.finance/t/m2-2022-leagues-coordinators-proposal/952/2#leagues-budget-20).\n\nHence, we are moving to a more simple, compact, and lean team structure, with a unique subDAO, the Contributors League, which handles:\n\n- Development (smart contract & front end): 2 FT, 1 PT\n- Design: 1 FT\n- Marketing: 1 PT\n- Coordination & Ops: 1 FT \n- Partnerships/BD: 2 FT \n- Grants: 1 PT\n\n### Concrete packages and contributors for Leagues M3\n\nThe following table is self-explanatory. The last two columns refer to the approximate monthly dedication of each contributor (due to what their role entails) in normal circumstances. That helps estimate the approximate budget for contributor compensations in USD. \n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreie4grmwmnmdazxzvg3opfmyb7mx4a2eokznuhfcq4psvg7pmr4rne)\n    \n\nCounting July as M2 rewards, and August/September with the revised M3 rewards, we get to a **required budget of $36k in stables or eq, and 88k IDLE**.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigwq3zpgnctgcwmb7zelgssubdtw4krr4zuy2xt7ekzhejjmy7sxm)\n    \n\n\n## Leagues M3 Quarterly Goals\n\nThe following initiatives is what the Contributors League will focus on and aim to ship during M3-2022:\n\n### Renovate dashboard\nSimpler, faster, and more intuitive dashboard, reducing maintenance and overhead costs. This will allow product suite users to enjoy using BY or PYTs daily and solve hiccups like loading time and data consistency. It is already under development with Dev and Design contributors, currently at the end of the wireframing phase as the following pics show.\n\n*Information Architecture Development:*\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreigbhvucee37ahfh4z2vi5ltd3zqu7lqqm6uzqr4tp2qbm6h7ebasm)\n    \n*New Dashboard Wireframes:*\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiaplfzcckdy53i3iun2qzcjfsxidw5dyikqt4zr7k54tciboozf74)\n    \n\n\n### Prepare BY/PYTs next iteration\nSimplify the product offering. Continue iterating, testing, and experimenting with the new PYTs design (like the Adaptive Yield Split), taking new yield sources into production (DeFi uncollateralized loans or decentralized options strategies), and ultimately implementing into the current BY a wider yield spectrum with PYTs Seniors (which will maintain BY’s high-security standard).\n\n*New Best Yield Architecture:*\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidya3yhk2milke4r75pkfqomks2q7lzinnepnkhmduvrx4b6wr5fm)\n    \n\n\nOther yield sources for PYTs like uncollateralized lending protocols, Decentralized Option Vaults, and more AMMs will be taken into consideration as new PYTs yield sources.\n\nIn general, this means an higher APY for Best Yield, and even more boosted APYs for Junior PYTs.\n\n**Keep up building B2B partnerships**\nKeep focusing on automation and support for integrators, both downstream and upstream. Build better tools, documentation, and tracking. Restore and grow TVL from there.\n\nWe have 4 product verticals for BY and PYTs:\n- New yield sources (eg Morpho, TrueFi)\n- New liquidity providers (DAOs, institutional funds)\n- New coverage features (de-pegging risk for stablecoins)\n- New products evolutions (pooled/aggregated Senior/Junior PYTs - if we see demand)\n\nThe programs that the partnerships/BD contributors can use are:\n- Lido D2D: discover partners to reach $50M-100M-150M TVL thresholds as per D2D collab\n- Polygon B2B: discover partners that can deposit >$100m TVL with MATIC rewards for 20% APY boost\n\nWith the BD contributors we will continue to build up TVL growth with these verticals and programs.\n\n### Update tokenomics and improve Gauges\n\nOnboarding new partners for Gauges and keep kickstarting the Gauges flywheel, as already started with Angle DAO. Additionally, we will release a revised version of the tokenomics, specifically with an adjustment of the IDLE liquidity mining and Gauges distribution, with a *substantial reduction of the overall emissions of IDLE tokens*.\n\n### Maintain our high-security standards\nOf course, continue building a resilient product suite to provide the most attractive risk-adjusted yields in the market. A DeFi protocol operating since 2019 without any hack/loss is a unique phenomenon. And we will keep maintaining it via monitoring, peer reviews, audits, risk framework, testing, and simulations. One of the main initiatives here will be to formalize and structure an *improved PYTs Default Management Procedure*.\n\n### Grow brand and community of users\nFocus on Twitter communications with targeted research efforts to explore new channels and marketing campaigns. Continue with B2B content series (like the [Treasury Mgmt article](https://medium.com/idle-finance/daos-treasury-management-479169a2694b), or B2B Partners Twitter Spaces). And grow a community of users that enjoy using PYTs and BY, builders that strive to research and build new strategies and tools for integrators, and governance participants that want to help improve the overall DAO workflow.\n",

Related forum discussion can be found [here](https://gov.angle.money/t/idle-angle-partnership-proposal-via-euler-pyts/350).\n\nBoth protocols were audited and rely on an open source codebase. As for Angle, audits can be found [here](https://docs.angle.money/resources/audits), and code is available [here](https://github.com/AngleProtocol).\n\n## Motivation\n\nA gauge on this pool with help incentivize senior lenders to come on top of Angle, thus creating opportunities for other junior lenders to join the pool, and hence using the Idle product for what it's been truly built for.\n\nEuler is also one of the best places where to get yield on Euros, and an IDLE gauge could definitely make Idle the main place to get protected Euro yield.\n\nIt would also open the door to further integrations involving notably Balancer pools with other senior tranche tokens.\n\n## Specifications\n\nThe Euler agEUR senior pool has already been deployed by the Idle team. It is available [here](https://beta.idle.finance/#/tranches/senior/euler/AGEUR).\n\n## Voting Options\n\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve agEUR Senior PYTs whitelisting\n**AGAINST**: Vote against agEUR Senior PYTs whitelisting\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "content": "Abstract\nThis is a proposal to add a Euler DAI, USDC and USDT PYT Senior tranche gauge to Idle.\n\nBackground\nEuler is a decentralised lending protocol that brings key innovations to DeFi like permissionless listing, market-based liquidations and much more.\n\nThe protocol has launched on mainnet in December 2021 and so far ha steady TVL of $210-250 million with most liquidity in WETH, WSTETH, USDC, DAI, WBTC and USDT.\n\nThe protocols was audited and rely on an open source codebase. As for Euler audits, they can be found here: https://docs.euler.finance/security/audits\n\nMotivation\nA gauge on this pool with help incentivize senior lenders to come on top of Euler, thus creating opportunities for other junior lenders to join the pool, and hence using the Idle product for what it’s been truly built for.\n\nEuler is also one of the best places where to get yield on stables given the tech but also the liquidity mining programme that bootstraps lending APYs.\n\nSpecifications\nThe Euler USDC/DAI/USDT senior pool has already been deployed by the Idle team. It is available here:\n\nhttps://app.idle.finance/#/tranches/senior/euler/USDC\nhttps://app.idle.finance/#/tranches/senior/euler/DAI\nhttps://app.idle.finance/#/tranches/senior/euler/USDT\n\nNext Steps\nThe forum proposal will be moved to the temperature check phase after 3 days of discussion.\n\nVoting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\nFOR : Approve Euler Senior PYTs whitelisting\nAGAINST : Vote against Euler Senior PYTs whitelisting\nDISCUSS MORE : Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both $IDLE token holders and stkIDLE holders.\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the approved calculator.",

      "content": "Summary:\n\nThis is a proposal for Idle DAO to collaborate with Hats.finance, create a hacker/auditors incentive pool to protect the Idle smart contracts. The goal of the vault is to incentivize vulnerability disclosure for Idle smart contracts. Liquidity can be added permissionless and LPs will be rewarded with $HAT token once the liquidity mining program is launched.\n\nMotivation\n\nProject coverage:\n\n24\\7 audits on your protocol with a proactive approach that incentivizes hackers to disclose vulnerabilities instead of hacking\nA disclosed vulnerability means no TVL\\ TOKEN loss\nPermissionless vault — token holders and the protocol community can deposit or withdraw in the same permissionless nature.\nPublic relation regarding mitigated vulnerabilities and security becomes a strength of the project.\nAttract more users that have high security requirements\nToken value:\n\nToken staked in vault → Token with higher security guarantees.\nIn the future one-sided yield farming based on $IDLE\nStaking tokens in the Hat vaults reduces circulating token supply\nCommittee:\n\nThe main incentive of a committee to triage reports is the potential to rescue users’ funds and the protocol’s reputation. In addition, Hats has two incentive mechanisms in place in addition:\n\nEach call to approve function (confirmation of an exploit that was resolved by the project committee) triggers a split function that sends part of the reward (default 5%) to the committee for triaging the issue and solving it in a responsible manner.\n\nEach exploit claim is attached with ETH denominated fees. This fee is intended to prevent bad actors to use the reporting function to create spam reduce the exploit report spam and to incentivize report triage by committees. The fees are transferred to the Hats governance wallet in order not to expose the project that was reported and will be transferred to the respected committees from time to time upon receipt of disclosure descriptions that correspond to the hash of the vulnerability on-chain. Submission fees are currently set to 0 so only tx gas costs apply.\n\nProject community \\ Token holders:\n\nJoin the effort to secure the ecosystem of Idle DAO.\nProtect their $IDLE by depositing a portion of their $IDLE holding to the bug bounty vault to make their holding more secure. By doing that, depositors potentially get $HAT tokens (on liquidity mining program launch)\nPermissionless vault — token holders and the protocol community can deposit or withdraw in the same permissionless nature.\nHacker/Auditors:\n\nFungible funds - no need to move the funds into mixers\nIncentivized by the big reward prize, less than what they could hack, but still a meaningful amount.\nPlay by black hat rules and get a white hat rewards.\nEasier to disclose vulnerability than to exploit it\nNo KYC\nReputation and notoriety as a proficient hacker\nBe good, do good for the ecosystem\nActions:\n\nIdle DAO will deposit $10.000 worth of $IDLE tokens to the Bug Bounty Vault on Hats Finance.\nVoting Options\n\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\nFOR: Approval of creating a Bug Bounty Vault on Hats Finance\nAGAINST: Rejection of creating a Bug Bounty Vault on Hats Finance\nDISCUSS MORE: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both $IDLE token holders and stkIDLE holders.\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the approved calculator.",

      "content": "### Summary\n\nThis IIP finalizes the transfer of 200k IDLE from the [Ecosystem Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aa1f98523ec15932dd5faac5d86e57115571c7) to the [Treasury League Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFb3bD022D5DAcF95eE28a6B07825D4Ff9C5b3814) to activate the stkIDLE delegation and KPI option, as part of the [D2D collaboration proposal: Idle <> Lido](https://gov.idle.finance/t/d2d-collaboration-proposal-idle-lido/991).\n\nWith its on-chain execution in about 5 days, Idle Leagues will stake the received $IDLE for 4 years, delegate the LP reward boost to Lido DAO as an NFT, and deploy the KPI option.\n\n### IIP motivations\n**D2D collaboration proposal: Idle <> Lido** --> [Forum post](https://gov.idle.finance/t/d2d-collaboration-proposal-idle-lido/991)\n\n> We see this proposal as a good opportunity to value the trust placed by Lido in our PYTs and double down on this collaborative effort for the benefit of both DAOs, communities, and the DeFi ecosystem as a whole. The proposal relies upon three initiatives, each lasting six months:\n> 1) stkIDLE delegation in favour of Lido\n> 2) $IDLE KPI option in favour of Lido\n> 3) $LDO reward program in favour of Idle LPs\n\n> Currently, the most used methodology of DAO2DAO collaboration is token swaps. A token swap creates an economic relationship between DAOs and lets communities diversify their treasury.\nA direct token swap, though, presents one main limitation such as a financial return bound solely to the token price and not to the performance of the collaboration. Historically it has proven poor in aligning incentives between DAOs.\n\n> We would like to introduce, instead, a voting power delegation. A delegation of voting power between DAOs through Gauges weights and LP reward boost opens up the doors to a new form of collaboration, by temporarily assigning resources that carry intrinsic financial benefits.\n\n> Thanks to this delegation, Idle and Lido will be able to:\n> * Foster meta-governance activities, with $LDO token holders involved in Idle DAO governance decisions. Idle will be able to broaden the current voting user-base, onboarding a reputable stakeholder in its decision-making process.\n> * Expand the Gauges ecosystem adoption, enabling Lido to join the competition to increase their stETH-based Gauge weights.\n> * Improve the business value proposition, with Lido empowered to offer increased APY (via LP reward boost) to onboard strategic liquidity providers interested to use risk-adjusted liquid staking solutions.\n\nDetails about stkIDLE delegation, $IDLE KPI option and $LDO reward program are available [here](https://gov.idle.finance/t/d2d-collaboration-proposal-idle-lido/991).\n\n\n### Specifications\n\nIIP-23 actions:\n* transfer of 200k IDLE from  the [Ecosystem Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aa1f98523ec15932dd5faac5d86e57115571c7) to the [Treasury League Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFb3bD022D5DAcF95eE28a6B07825D4Ff9C5b3814): 1 action\n\n[This IIP](https://gov.idle.finance/t/iip-23-d2d-collaboration-proposal-idle-lido/1001) complies with the stkIDLE Voting Framework. Only stkIDLE holders can vote on this poll.\n\nThe threshold to make the poll valid (both metrics should be reached):\n- 30% of circulating stkIDLE voting the poll (min. 178,007 stkIDLE)\n- at least 70% on the same option.\n\nIf the poll reaches the quorum, the community multisig will broadcast the decision on-chain. Current On-chain Voting Power: 947,306 $IDLE\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n\n**FOR**: Approve IIP-23 execution\n**AGAINST**: Reject IIP-23 execution\n",

      "title": "[Leagues] M2-2022 Coordinators Applications",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis Snapshot poll serves as the official voting phase of Coordinators Proposal for the Leagues M2-2022 mandate. Below you can find the Coordinators Proposal detail. IDLE community will express its opinion to move forward (FOR/AGAINST) the proposal and initiate the M2-2022 with the details reported down below.\n\n## Background\nThe Coordinators is a new framework introduced for the Idle Leagues application process. Its aim is to introduce a more lean process to create and structure Leagues, while relieving IDLE tokenholders from the burden of voting every newly empowered contributor for the Leagues, scoping the vote to Leagues budget and Coordinators only.\n\nThis framework has been voted and approved by [IDLE tokenholders via Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth/proposal/0x6a9c3f3486d2bb132be35f354fea23a76714ac21d599edcc94339a2f34345623)\n\n# Coordinators Proposal\n\n## Authors\n@Teo @william\n\n## Introduction\nThis proposal outlines the Coordinators Proposal for M2-2022 (April-June) with @Teo and @william as Coordinators. Find below more about the proposed Leagues’ Roadmap, Structure, and Budget for it.\n\n## Leagues Roadmap\n\n### The Vision ✨\n\nTo bring Idle into the mainstream and serve all businesses and institutional partners, we have to make the protocol **more scalable**, keep our **high-security standard**, and provide a **sustainable way to integrate** with our product suite.\n\nExpanding the Idle DAO product suite and extending the yield sources for PYTs to strengthen its market fit is the primary objective for M2 2022. Our [North Star](https://www.grow.com/blog/what-is-a-north-star-metric) metric will be the **[TVL in Idle DAO product suite](https://defillama.com/protocol/idle-finance)** (Best Yield, Perpetual Yield Tranches, and future products).\n\nThere is a significant margin for improvement regarding the TVL and we believe we can aim to see triple digits growth this year.\n\nIn addition, we will be using as KPI the [fees generated by the Idle DAO product suite](https://dune.xyz/idle.finance/Idle-Finance-Revenue-Outlook), as they indicate the sustainability of Idle DAO.\n\n### The Strategy ♟\n\nTo do that, we want to focus on what the customer needs and wants to use. Our goal is to be the platform of choice for yield automation and optimization, both in terms of returns and risks.\n\nThe product suite will be tailored for:\n\n* **Yield Integration Partners:** like other DeFi protocols, wallets, and platforms that want to build compelling use-cases and monetize their models to maximize yields by serving their users' risk-adjusted products with high-security standards. Idle’s partnership programs allow partners and developers to easily integrate yield into their own services. In an effort to make BY and PYT strategies accessible from virtually anywhere, any protocol that integrates our product suite can earn up to a 50% profit share from its contributed TVL. We are here to grow the DeFi ecosystem together.\n* **DAOs, Institutional and Corporate Treasuries**: All over the world there are trillions of dollars sitting in DAO, institutional and corporate treasures. These balances earn nothing. In some cases, they have to pay banks for the privilege of holding their cash. Treasury management is typically a conservative approach to capital management, due to the many responsibilities tied to this capital, as well as the need for a certain degree of predictability around it, if at least for budgetary allocation purposes. As such, we focus on PYTs' risk-adjusted profiles as a solution to provide structured, reliable, and efficient capital growth, depending on their risk profile and allocation strategy.\n\n### Product Roadmap 🏭\n\nBelow is a list of high-level product initiatives we are prioritizing for this second mandate of 2022; as they progress, proposals will be made including all the details. These initiatives will be mainly developed by the Development League, and propagated and amplified with the community by the Treasury and Communication Leagues.\n\n#### PYTs Collabs: AMMs Flywheel\n\nStrengthening the AMMs flywheel for PYTs with integration partners by adding Uniswap, Sushiswap, Quickswap and Balancer as yield sources (both on Ethereum and Polygon). The AMMs flywheel is a powerful mechanism for DAOs or protocols that need to bootstrap liquidity for their markets without having to sacrifice their governance tokens to do so, but rather leveraging the Senior/Junior APY distribution.\n\n#### Leveraged staked ETH derivatives PYTs\n\nA series of PYTs based on derivatives of staked ETH with a folding strategy to leverage APYs. In sight of The Merge, this will allow investors to squeeze all the capital efficiency out of ETH staking while preserving their risk profile.\n\n#### PYTs Factory: achieve the long tail of assets\n\nBuild a factory interface for PYTs, where anyone can create new opportunities, bootstrap financial products, and markets. This implementation would allow partners to create and bootstrap their own PYTs and include them in the IDLE Gauges with the [whitelisting governance framework](https://gov.idle.finance/t/gauges-initial-gauges-batch-whitelisting-process/947).\n\n#### Best Yield 5.0: yield sources expansion\n\nExpand the yield sources for our flagship Best Yield strategy; these can include new lending protocols such as [Euler](https://www.euler.finance/#/), or our own PYTs to bundle the yield generation and automation experience for the Idle ecosystem.\n\n#### Best Yield and PYTs maintainance\n\nMaintaining Best Yield and PYTs strategies, either in terms of continuous improvement of our security monitoring systems or harvesting operations.\n\n#### Yield Automation Rebranding: a new face for Idle DAO\n\nRelease of the brand new landing page and dashboard, with a revamped visual identity, new robot mascots, and aesthetics, all oriented towards the concept of “DeFi Yield Automation Protocol”.\n\n### Organizational Roadmap 🏛\n\nBelow is a list of high-level organizational initiatives we are looking to work on during this second mandate of 2022; as they progress, proposals will be made including all the details. These initiatives will be mainly executed and maintained by the Treasury and Communication Leagues, with the help of the Development League where any technical input is needed.\n\n#### Partnerships/Collaborations\n\n* Implement and improve the BizDev strategy with a focus on:\n  * Integration with DeFi protocols, wallets, and dashboards\n  * Collab with DAO and institutional treasury managers\n* BY and PYTs content creation (docs, articles, one-pagers, decks) and onboarding/feedback sessions with current and prospective partners\n\n#### Communication and Growth\n\n* Prepare Idle DAO for summer DeFi conferences\n* Grow community engagement in Discord and Twitter\n* Grow presence in DeFi media outlets\n* Organize open talks with DeFi SME for topics concerning Idle DAO (eg [legal structure for Idle DAO](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-dao-legal-structure-summary/898))\n* Maintain constant communications with our community in Twitter/Discord/Telegram regaring the updates from Leagues initiatives and DAO achievements\n* Prepare launch campaign, content, and design materials for the upcoming Yield Automation rebranding\n\n#### Community Engagement\n\n* Maintain, support, and update [IGPs and RFPs](https://www.notion.so/idlelabs/IGP-Idle-Grants-Program-a91d2937f24c4539a6538e48777fbfbd)\n* Improve governance participation via meta-delegates (universities initiative)\n\n#### $IDLE Tokenomics\n\n* Maintain and make IDLE markets more efficient in terms of slippage\n* Coordinate with lending protocols and leverage tools to implement IDLE as collateral\n* Collabs with current PYTs partners for Gauges voting and VEV\n* Convex/Backscratcher for IDLE Gauges\n\n#### Organizational and Financial Management\n\n* HR League with a legal structure (collab with [Kali DAO](https://medium.com/@listofdaos/legal-game-changer-kali-dao-97fbf48376c5) or similar) for payroll mgmt and 3rd party contracts\n* Additional research for UNA or similar legal structure for Idle DAO\n* Setup a common Leagues task mgmt dashboard (now it’s Trello + Notion)\n* Recurrent financial reporting in the forum regarding Idle DAO North Star and main KPIs\n\n## Leagues Structure\n\nTo achieve the aforementioned goals and roadmap, we propose the following Leagues Structure with 15 core contributors and advisors:\n\n* **Communication League**: 2 contributor.\n* **Development League**: 4 contributors.\n* **Treasury League**: 5 contributors.\n* **HR League**: 1 contributor (initially provided by Treasury League).\n\nThis structure can be changed throughout the mandate, within the budget scope, to allow new Leagues members to join if needed. Contributors will be announced after the vote take place and it’s successful.\n\n## Leagues Budget\n\nThe Leagues’ budget for Mandate 2 of 2022 (M2-2022), spanning from April to June 2022, sums up to ~$155k.\n\n![image](ipfs://QmTFbNRHZxbCNmPiaQvjYjNvvqpxrkCxfzkCoRXCHkRzvp)\n\nThe budget will be used to pay for Leagues members' contributions (Rewards) and to cover the operational costs of the three Idle Leagues (Operations).\n\nThe complete M2-2022 budget file is accessible at [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TwAKsOpw5mTV0A8G0UEMwItXkLmBpucHJs2J9Bc3Q-w/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n–\n**Please note that the reported token amounts are subject to price fluctuations, hence their amounts could change at the time of funds transfer. The prices shown are quotes from April 06th, 2022.*",

      "title": "stkIDLE Whitelisting Process Implementation",
      "content": "### Summary\nThis proposal will [start the process to decentrally enable any contract to interact with IDLE staking (stkIDLE module)](https://gov.idle.finance/t/stkidle-whitelisting-process-implementation/958).\nDAO votes to deploy a *SmartWalletWhitelist* contract and appoints the actor managing the process.\n\nIf the proposal passes the Temperature Check, an on-chain IIP will follow.\n\n\n### Motivation\nThe locking module can be called only by EOA (no smart contracts) to avoid the tokenization and the transferability of the staked tokens, which would nullify the effectiveness of the locking.\n\nThe stkIDLE whitelisting process represents an onboarding barrier, potentially reducing the Idle DAO’s efforts in supporting the development of an open and composable ecosystem.\nAt the same time, today no contracts are allowed to mint stkIDLE.\n\nThis proposal introduces the implementation of the *SmartWalletWhitelist* contract to manage the contracts interacting with the staking module.\n\nMore info about the motivation is available [here](https://gov.idle.finance/t/stkidle-whitelisting-process-implementation/958).\n\n### Specifications\nThere are 3 actors that can finalize the whitelisting process via *SmartWalletWhitelist*:\n1) Idle DAO: applicants need to post a request in the forum, the DAO votes via Temperature Check, and then an IIP finalizes the whitelisting on-chain. It requires applicants to publicly unveil their addresses, and the process lasts about 2 weeks.\n2) Treasury League: applicants get in contact with TL members to be whitelisted. While addresses can be publicly revealed, the owners are not disclosed to preserve their privacy. The process requires a few days.\n3) No actors: fully permissionless whitelisting, with all the contracts directly allowed to interact with the staking module. The whitelisting is immediate.\n\nThis proposal suggests a two-phase journey to gradually enable the decentralization of the whitelisting.\n \nWhile the final aim is the removal of decisional actors, the consequences of that decision are unknown and the process is irreversible. Indeed, once the process is fully open, the creation of a whitelist would lock indefinitely contracts that already staked IDLE.\n\nFor this reason, the Treasury League can temporarily process the whitelisting requests. This intermediary phase would reduce the frictions to onboard new smart contract-based liquidity providers.\nThe TL would accept all the requests unless there are clear proofs that a specific whitelisting would harm the protocol. In that case, the issue would be publicly discussed among the Idle Governance.\n\nOnce Idle DAO and its stakeholders get familiar with the stkIDLE whitelisting process and there is no evidence of unexpected scenarios, the Governance can fully decentralize the process and remove the appointed actor.\nAfter the implementation of *SmartWalletWhitelist*, which requires an on-chain IIP, the contract address will be available.\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**Idle DAO**: Appoint Idle DAO as whitelisting actor \n**Treasury League**: Appoint Treasury League as whitelisting actor\n**No actors**: Let the whitelisting process fully open\n**Discuss more**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

The new pBTC Convex pool has been recently launched and Dev League will proceed with its integration into PYTs.\n\nProposed whitelisted Gauges are the Senior PYTs of:\n* stETH\n* FRAX3crv\n* MIM3crv\n* stecrv\n* alUSD3crv\n* 3EUR\n* mUSDcrv\n* mUSD\n* pBTCcrv\n\nThere will be a delay of a few days between the launch of Gauges and the first community voting period.\nDuring this timeframe, the initial weights of Gauges will be proportional to generated fees among the listed PYTs.\nWith the first voting round, stkIDLE holders will be empowered to set the future Gauges weights.\n\n### Idle Gauges Whitelisting Framework\nWhile PYTs will be the main beneficiary of Gauge listing, the process is also open to pools controlled by other protocols.\nAny smart contract is eligible for Idle Gauges, including AMM pools, on-top PYT products, and tools that empower Idle DAO to expand the ecosystem with new use cases.\n\nThe whitelisting process will be composed of 3 steps:\n\n1. *Forum Proposal*\n2. *Temperature Check*\n3. *On-chain Gauge Whitelisting*\n\nDetails about this process are available [here](https://gov.idle.finance/t/gauges-initial-gauges-batch-whitelisting-process/947).\n\n### Specification\nThis proposal will:\n* Confirm the first batch of 9 Gauges (Senior PYTs)\n* Approve the Gauges Whitelisting framework\n\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve Initial Gauges batch & Whitelisting process\n**AGAINST**: Vote against Initial Gauges batch & Whitelisting process\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

      "content": "### Summary\nThis proposal will [restructure the Idle Leagues application process and officially introduce the *Coordinator* role](https://gov.idle.finance/t/leagues-coordinators-making-leagues-framework-lean/945).\n\nThe aim is to introduce a more lean process to create and structure Leagues, while relieving IDLE tokenholders from the burden of voting every newly empowered contributor for the Leagues, scoping the vote to Leagues budget and Coordinators only. \n\nIf the proposal passes the Temperature Check, changes will be live from the upcoming mandate (M2-2022).\n\n### Motivation\nAs mentioned in a [previous post about learnings and improvements for the Leagues framework](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-leagues-learnings-and-improvements-for-the-next-mandate/877), we have identified the need to have operational reference points in each League. This would allow tackling a lack of accountability and a directional guide for Leagues members, particularly for newly empowered ones. \n\nA Leagues Coordinator acts as a glue between multiple Leagues and coordinates contributors' work to achieve a long-term goal within Idle DAO. Introducing this position would provide Idle DAO and Leagues with a simple way of managing and holding Coordinators accountable through the future mandates.\n\n### Specification\n**Coordinators Framework**\nCoordinators will play a key role in the Idle Leagues by acting as the link between Idle DAO and the Leagues contributors. Coordinators define the needed Leagues *Structure* for the mandate, the *Roadmap* they want to accomplish, and the required *Budget*. They would be accountable for prioritizing the work and taking both business value and tech aspects into consideration to direct Leagues members' efforts towards the growth of the Idle DAO and its product suite. \n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/idle/optimized/1X/4162a5b8ebbeca1e9cd348a084d2f10ceb73463a_2_951x750.jpeg)\n\n**Coordinators Proposal**\nAt the beginning of each mandate, there will be a 1-week window for Coordinators' proposals submission. This is open to anyone and allows the community to maintain a decentralized framework to operate the DAO.  \n\nThe Coordinators Proposal is formed by:\n* Leagues Roadmap\n* Leagues Budget\n* Leagues Structure\n\nThe *Leagues Roadmap* is an essential part of a Coordinator Proposal, where the Coordinators specify their perspective, in as great detail as possible, on how to successfully achieve the Leagues Mandate goals they are proposing to onboard, and how they plan to organize and provide accountability into their use of the budget. Their responsibilities will be to coordinate efforts and foster cross-Leagues initiatives to reach the proposed roadmap.\n\nCoordinators are required to define the *Leagues Budget*, which allows them to meet their responsibilities by recruiting Contributors and sustaining the expenses for growth initiatives.\n\nLastly, Coordinators define the *Leagues Structure*. This illustrates the organizational structure of the Leagues that will be formed in order to achieve the Roadmap. \n\nMore info about this proposal and closing notes are available [here](https://gov.idle.finance/t/leagues-coordinators-making-leagues-framework-lean/945).\n\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve Leagues Coordinators\n**AGAINST**: Vote against Leagues Coordinators\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

      "content": "### Summary\nThis proposal will [concentrate part of the current Uniswap v3 deployment (28k IDLE and 11 ETH) into a 土 4x price range, and deploy an additional 50k IDLE out of range to improve the oracle’s resiliency](https://gov.idle.finance/t/uniswap-v3-liquidity-concentration-and-50k-idle-deployment/943).\n\nIf the proposal passes the Temperature Check, it will be followed by an on-chain vote.\n\n### Motivation\nUniswap v3 allows LPs to provide liquidity in a particular range, increasing capital efficiency and reducing slippage.\n\nCurrently, we have 22 WETH and 56k IDLE in UNI v3 full range. The goal of this treasury operation is to deploy half of this liquidity (11 WETH and 28k IDLE) into Uniswap v3 with a range of 4x above and 4x below the price of IDLE, which would help the IDLE/ETH Uniswap V3 pool to have 2x concentrated liquidity and a ~50% reduction in slippage in that specific range. \n\nAt the time of writing, the liquidity deployment in a 土4x range would entail the following prices\n$0.28 < $IDLE price = $1.10 < $4.40.\n\n*Table 1.1 - ROI and fees with different price ranges (last 30 days)*\n| Strategy | ROI      | APR      | APY      |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n| Full price range (unbounded) | 0.30% | 4.10%  | 4.20%  |\n| 土4x $IDLE price range | 0.90% | 11.8%  | 12.5%  |\n| 土2x $IDLE price range | 1.50% | 20.0%  | 22.1%  |\n\nThe liquidity deployment 土4x the price range requires minimum efforts and less impermanent loss, as the deployment would cover a wide range.\n\n*Table 1.2 - Current Slippage on Uniswap v3*\n| Pool size | Slippage      | \n| -------- | -------- | \n| $10k | 10.5% | \n| $50k | 36.9% | \n| $100k | 53.8% | \nThis deployment will allow reducing the current slippage also on DEX aggregators as well while increasing the resilience of IDLE’s UNI v3 oracle. \n\n*Table 1.3 - Hypothetical Slippage on Uniswap v3 after liquidity concentration*\n| Pool size | Slippage      | \n| -------- | -------- | \n| $10k | 7.8% | \n| $50k | 27.6% | \n| $100k | 40.3% |\n\nThis snapshot includes also another 50k IDLE out-of-range deployment, 5x-10x above the current price (between $5 and $10). The position will be manually rebalanced, in case the token price reaches the $5 boundary.\n\nThis deployment would accommodate high-size swaps with lower slippage while strengthening the resiliency of the Uni v3 oracle against manipulation attacks. Given that the target range is far from the current price, this action represents a single-sided IDLE deployment with no impermanent loss.\n\nMore info about this proposal is available [here](https://gov.idle.finance/t/uniswap-v3-liquidity-concentration-and-50k-idle-deployment/943).\n\n### Specification\nActions:\n* [Treasury League multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFb3bD022D5DAcF95eE28a6B07825D4Ff9C5b3814) will concentrate 28k IDLE and 11 ETH into 土 4x price range (no on-chain actions). \n* Route 50k IDLE from [Ecosystem Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aA1f98523Ec15932dd5fAAC5d86e57115571C7) to Treasury League multisig, which will deploy funds into 5x-10x price position in Uniswap v3.\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve Liquidity Concentration and 50k IDLE Deployment in Uni v3\n**AGAINST**: Vote against Liquidity Concentration and 50k IDLE Deployment in Uni v3\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] Bancor Follow-up Liquidity Deployment (187k IDLE)",
      "content": "### Summary\nThis proposal will [ deploy 187k IDLE into the IDLE/BNT pool on Bancor, reaching $1m in pool liquidity and reducing current slippage by 50%](https://gov.idle.finance/t/bancor-follow-up-liqudiity-deployment-187k-idle/939).\n\nIf the proposal passes the Temperature Check, it will be followed by an on-chain vote.\n\n### Motivation\nIn early January, Idle DAO [approved a 187k IDLE liquidity deployment into Bancor](https://gov.idle.finance/t/remove-idle-smart-treasury-and-deploy-200k-idle-into-bancor-and-uni-v3/885).\nThat action resulted in **1.68% APR** on the IDLE side while benefiting from impermanent loss protection and single side deployment.\nAt the time of writing, the IDLE/BNT pool has ~$500k total liquidity.\n\nCurrently, we are already able to increase IDLE/BNT pool liquidity on Bancor by another 257k IDLE, and no proposal needs to be voted on their side if Idle DAO plans to finalize this liquidity deployment.\nWith an additional **187k IDLE** deposit, Idle DAO can achieve **$1m liquidity**, thanks to the BNT matching.\n\nWith 55% of the whole IDLE-related liquidity ([source](https://dune.xyz/idle.finance/dollarIDLE-DEXs-Metrics)), Bancor is the most liquid pool today.\nIn terms of volumes, Bancor manages 26% of the weekly volumes, following SushiSwap (41%) and Uniswap (32%).\n\nSushiSwap and Uniswap still represent the main markets, but they require to deposit both IDLE and ETH. The deployment of $250k IDLE into Bancor would be automatically translated into $500k liquidity.\nBancor is still the most straightforward way to reach that milestone without the need to match the ETH side and with minimal capital deployment.\n\nFurthermore, the aggregation of the liquidity in a single pair enables better market performances, generating benefits for community members that interact with DEX aggregators like Paraswap, 1Inch, Matcha.\n\n*Table 1.1 - Current Slippage on DEXes*\n| SIZE | Bancor | SushiSwap | Uniswap | Paraswap |1Inch |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|$ 10k|4.1%|10.6%|10.5%|2.7%|4.3%|\n|$ 50k|17.7%|36.6%|36.9%|12.0%|12.3%\n|$ 100k|30.2%|53.5%|53.8%|19.5%|21.2%\n\n*Table 1.2 - Hypothetical Slippage with $1m total liquidity on Bancor*\n|SIZE| SLIPPAGE|\n|---|---|\n|$ 10k |1.8%|\n|$ 50k| 8.4%|\n|$ 100k |15.5%|\n\nThis proposal is connected with \"[Treasury Management M1-2022](https://gov.idle.finance/t/treasury-management-m1-2022/938)\" post, released by @biaf, which analyzed the past liquidity deployments and their outcomes.\n\nMore info about this proposal available [here](https://gov.idle.finance/t/bancor-follow-up-liquidity-deployment-187k-idle/939).\n\n### Specification\n*Actions*:\n* Route 187k IDLE from [Ecosystem Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aA1f98523Ec15932dd5fAAC5d86e57115571C7) to the [Treasury League multisig](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xFb3bD022D5DAcF95eE28a6B07825D4Ff9C5b3814/balances). \nTreasury League will deploy funds into the Bancor IDLE/BNT pool.\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve Bancor liquidity deployment\n**AGAINST**: Vote against Bancor liquidity deployment\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] -  $IDLE Gauges for Tranches",
      "content": "### Summary\nThis Temperature Check introduces the [Gauge Voting and Farming Boost modules](https://gov.idle.finance/t/introducing-idle-gauges-model-for-tranches/913), adding new Governance features to $IDLE on the Ethereum network.\n\nThis proposal routes 30% of the $IDLE currently allocated to the LM fund into the Gauge Voting for 6 months (178,200 $IDLE). The goal is to incentivize liquidity provision on the Senior class of the Perpetual Yield Tranches while aligning LPs and $IDLE token holders.\n\nThe approval of the proposal will empower Development League to build the smart contract infrastructure and transfer 178,200 $IDLE from the IdleController to the IdleGaugesFund contract.\n\nWith the launch of Gauges, Idle protocol will distribute $IDLE to Best Yield (BY) pools via IdleController and to Perpetual Yield Tranches (PYT) via Gauge Voting. The overall $IDLE emission rate will not change (3,300 $IDLE/day).\n\n### Motivation\n\nIdle DAO has [already implemented](https://gov.idle.finance/t/single-idle-staking/503) stkIDLE minting (locking system) and the fee-sharing mechanism.\n\nThis proposal aims to set up two additional features: Gauge Voting and Farming Boost.\n\n**By integrating the Gauge Voting and Farming Boost modules, token holders that lock their $IDLE (minting stkIDLE) will be able to vote on PYT $IDLE allocation and also boost their individual rewards.**\n\nIn the beginning, only the Senior class of PYT will be eligible to receive Gauges incentives.\nThat class receives a smaller share of the underlying yield due to the coverage protection they receive, and $IDLE farming would stimulate further liquidity deployment in this class of tranches.\n\n*Benefits*\n* Less $IDLE circulating supply due to more locked tokens\n* Development of $IDLE booster vaults by other protocols\n* New $IDLE-based products\n* Protocols accumulating accrued $IDLE\n* Alignment between LPs and $IDLE token holders\n* DAO2DAO collaborations, with protocols fostering token holders to vote for their PYT\n\n*Tokenomics Specifications*\nThe Idle protocol currently distributes about 3,300 $IDLE per day, 1.2m $IDLE per year.\nIdle Best-Yield on Ethereum represents the main Idle product today, and it’s the place where most of the TVL is located; thus, it’s crucial to not drastically influence returns for current LPs.\n\nThis proposal routes 30% of the $IDLE allocated to the [liquidity mining program](https://etherscan.io/address/0x275da8e61ea8e02d51edd8d0dc5c0e62b4cdb0be) into Gauges for 6 months, resulting in 990 $IDLE/day distributed over a semester (178,200 $IDLE in total).\n\nThe Best-Yield reward reduction represents a minor component of the yield generated via Idle protocol, while that amount would empower Idle to sustain Gauges funding.\n\n*Technical Specifications*\nThe system would consist of the following smart contracts, as in Curve Finance:\n* LiquidityGauge: measuring liquidity provided by users over time.\n* GaugeController: maintaining a list of gauges and respective weights.\n* IdleDistributor: forked from Curve’s Minter, it will be slightly modified.\n* IdleGaugesFund: holding and releasing $IDLE tokens on IdleDistributor request. This component will also maintain parameters for $IDLE distribution to Gauges.\n\nThe main difference between the Idle Gauge system and the Curve Gauge System is in the IdleGaugesFund that replaces the CRV token (that encodes the release schedule).\n\nA scheme of the potential Idle Gauge system is reported below.\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/idle/original/1X/5108c5994e10e7f049a2d4f8a61d16b6d7cbc8f4.jpeg)\n\nA detailed description of motivation, specifications, and final considerations is available in the [forum post](https://gov.idle.finance/t/introducing-idle-gauges-model-for-tranches/913).\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve $IDLE Gauges for Tranches\n**AGAINST**: Vote against $IDLE Gauges for Tranches\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).",

At the end of the playoff season, token holders will select 15 assets.\nThen, the top5 most voted assets during the finals (out of 15 candidates) will win the contest and get their [Perpetual Yield Tranches live and running](https://idle.finance/#/dashboard/tranches).\n\n*Timeline*\n* January 20th: *contest kickoff*\n* January 20th to January 27th: *Playoffs*\n* January 27th to February 3rd: *Finals*\n\nSnapshot criteria and benefits for winning communities are described in the [announcement post](https://gov.idle.finance/t/tranches-battle-choose-which-asset-integrate-next/896).\n\n\n### Voting Options\n\n![](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard11/uploads/idle/original/1X/3d0ddb1567db57bfce510e7c0ac424be6cbce767.jpeg)\n\nSpread your voting power across any number of choices listed below:\n* stethCrv\n* 3poolCrv\n* mimustCrv\n* 3CrvCrypto2\n* ib3Crv\n* renCrv\n* ibbtcCrv\n* alethCrv\n* usdnCrv \n* alusdCrv \n* rsvCrv \n* dolaCrv \n* pCrv \n* eurtCrv \n* ustCrv \n* usdkCrv \n* dusdCrv \n* husdCrv \n* tCrv \n* eurnCrv \n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nIf you are involved in a DAO featured here as one of the listed tokens, you can increase the chances to get your pool voted by illustrating to [our community](https://gov.idle.finance/t/tranches-battle-choose-which-asset-integrate-next/896) how Idle DAO can benefit by listing your asset.",

      "title": "[Temperature Check] -  Remove Idle Smart Treasury and deploy 200k IDLE into Bancor and Uni v3",
      "content": "### Summary\nThis proposal will [redeem liquidity from Idle Smart Treasury (210k IDLE and 14 WETH)](https://gov.idle.finance/t/remove-idle-smart-treasury-and-deploy-200k-idle-into-bancor-and-uni-v3/885) to deploy 187k IDLE into [IDLE/BNT](https://app.bancor.network/pools/add-liquidity/0x1092d8d818C09a55968180a4383049f91689C2b4) pool on Bancor and 23k IDLE + 14 WETH into [Uni v3 full-range pool](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x79e42a2bb91a0f9118e2b5231958c1eaefce390c).\nIdle DAO will benefit from Bancor single-sided liquidity deployment and impermanent loss protection while reducing slippage on DEX. Furthermore, the DAO will increase the robustness of Uni v3 oracle, allowing more users to safely interact with $IDLE lending platforms.\n \nIf the proposal passes the Temperature Check, it will be merged with the next IIP.\n### Motivation\nBancor deployed the first-ever automated market makers (AMMs) on Ethereum in 2017, and currently manages [$1.3b in total liquidity](https://app.bancor.network/pools). Bancor Protocol was audited [multiple times](https://docs.bancor.network/ethereum-contracts/security), and its DAO launched a $100k [bug bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/bancor/) via Immunefi.\n \nThe IDLE/BNT pool had $100k in liquidity, half in IDLE and half in BNT. Bancor DAO [increased the depth of the pool to 250K BNT](https://gov.bancor.network/t/proposal-increase-trading-liquidity-limit-to-250k-bnt-on-the-idle-bnt-pool/3275). \n \nThis proposal aims to deploy 187k IDLE from the current Smart treasury ([Balancer pool](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xcaf467dfe064a1f54e4ece8515ddf326b9be801e/about)) to the IDLE/BNT pool and earn a yield from that deposit.\n \nA larger IDLE/BNT pool will result in having approximately 2x the liquidity currently held in [Sushi IDLE/WETH pool](https://analytics.sushi.com/pairs/0xa7f11e026a0af768d285360a855f2bded3047530), without the burden of incentivizing liquidity provision (Idle DAO already distributed 180k IDLE during a 6-month program) or owning the other asset of the pair.\nThe expected slippage reduction will be extended to Paraswap too, as the DEX aggregator will simultaneously route the funds across multiple AMMs.\n \nWith the upcoming [Bancor V3](https://try.bancor.network/), there will be no cap on liquidity deployment, and the platform will also enable auto compounding rewards and instant impermanent loss protection.\nThe 10% fee stream routed into the Smart treasury will be addressed to FeeTreasury, increasing its share to 20% of total performance revenues.\n \nBancor features and expected slippage reduction, are detailed in the [forum proposal](https://gov.idle.finance/t/remove-idle-smart-treasury-and-deploy-200k-idle-into-bancor-and-uni-v3/885).\n*Uni V3 Full-range liquidity deployment*\n14 WETH and equivalent IDLE value (~23k IDLE at the time of writing) now sitting into the Balancer pool will be deployed in UNI v3, covering the full price range. Idle DAO already funded UNI v3 pool with $120k in October, unlocking the Fuse listing. That oracle is currently used by Euler too, lending primitive with isolated markets. More liquidity into the Uni v3 will strengthen the oracle resiliency against manipulation attacks.\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve Bancor and Uni v3 liquidity deployment\n**AGAINST**: Vote against Bancor and Uni v3 liquidity deployment\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n \n",

It demonstrated robustness and transparency for on-chain processes, with composability via meta-governance features.\nIn March 2021, Compound DAO deployed an upgraded version of it: [Governor Bravo](https://www.comp.xyz/t/governor-bravo-development/942).\nA comparison between the two infrastructures is reported in this [article by Tally](https://medium.com/tally-blog/understanding-governor-bravo-69b06f1875da).\n\nTo foster the migration, Idle Leagues included in the brand new [Idle Grants Program 2.0](https://idlelabs.notion.site/Request-for-proposals-RFPs-79b52c752b544f60bcf879c2ba4b5674) the RFP-13 “Upgrade Idle Governor Alpha to Compound Governor Bravo”.\n\n@Dantop [worked on the integration](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-grants-program-2-0-igp/740/3) and successfully delivered the code needed to finalize the Governance upgrade.\n\n### Details\nThe new implementation is available [here](https://github.com/Idle-Labs/idle-governance/pull/4):\n* [GovernorBravoDelegate](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe8707753c468238723887a4b7b47495a2d311f85) (Delegate, ie Implementation)\n* [GovernorBravoDelegator](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d5fc645320be0a085a32885f078f7121e5e5375) (Delegator, ie Proxy)\n\nIt was developed by @Dantop and peer-reviewed by Dev League. Governor Bravo was audited by [Open Zeppelin](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-governor-bravo-audit/).\n\nActions:\n* Update to Governor Bravo: 3 action\n* Send $3000 in $IDLE to Dantop: 1 action\n\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve Governor Bravo Upgrade\n**AGAINST**: Vote against Governor Bravo Upgrade\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

      "content": "### Summary\nThis Temperature Check gauges the community sentiment on the [proposal to refund $25k in $IDLE to Enzyme Finance](https://gov.idle.finance/t/enzyme-bug-bounty-cooperation/741) for the bug bounty paid to the reporter of a potential vulnerability in our partners’ integrations.\n\nIf the proposal passes the Temperature Check, it will be merged with the next IIP. \n\n### Motivation\nOn November 18th, the [Enzyme Finance team](https://enzyme.finance/) notified us regarding a potential vulnerability that was affecting their integration with Idle Protocol. As reported in the [Medium article](https://idlefinance.medium.com/potential-vulnerability-disclosure-2021-11-18-9bc0a2cdc0f2), this vulnerability could have put funds of Idle Protocol’s integrators at risk.\n\nEnzyme has an active bug bounty program launched on [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/enzymefinance/). Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System. All payouts are done by the Enzyme Finance team directly and are denominated in USD. Payouts are done in USDC up to $400,000.\n\nThe final reward amount for critical smart contract vulnerabilities is capped at 10% of the funds at risk based on the vulnerability reported. In this case, the issue would have impacted 3 vaults on Enzyme and up to $400k worth of funds.\n\nDue to the quality and professionalism of the report and the potential/scope of the issue as well, they found it inappropriate to pay out less than their “high” tier ($80k). For this reason, Enzyme rewarded the bug hunter with $90k.\n\nFollowing this payout, Idle Leagues proposes to indemnify Enzyme with 6250 $IDLE ($25k using [20-day average rate](https://dune.xyz/idle.finance/dollarIDLE-20-day-Rolling-Price)).\n\n\n### Details\n\nActions:\n* Send 6250 $IDLE from Ecosystem Fund to Enzyme wallet: 1 action\n\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve Enzyme Bug Bounty Cooperation\n**AGAINST**: Vote against Enzyme Bug Bounty Cooperation\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n",

      "content": "### Summary\nThis off-chain poll aims to gauge the sentiment among stkIDLE holders regarding [IIP-17](https://gov.idle.finance/t/iip-17-idletokens-upgrade-to-remove-flash-loans/738), which has been [launched on-chain](https://idle.finance/#/governance/proposals/17).\nIf the poll will reach the quorum, the vote will be broadcasted on-chain.\n\nThis IIP would disable the flashLoan functionality from Idle Protocol.\n\n### IIP Motivation\nIdle Leagues were notified regarding a potential vulnerability that was affecting partners’ integration with Idle Protocol. \n\nThe vulnerability was discovered and **mitigated within 1 hour**. All funds are safe and no action is required by partners or users. **Deposits in Idle protocol have always been safe**.\n\nTo dampen any possible malicious outcome on the partners’ side, Leagues activated [the Pause Guardian procedure](https://docs.idle.finance/advanced/admin-powers). The `deposit` and `rebalance` functions have been temporarily paused on Ethereum, while `redeem` is still available. This IIP does not involve Polygon strategies, which have been already updated.\n\nIIP-17 will finalize the issue removal by changing the `flashLoan` method in a no-op, effectively disabling this functionality. After the on-chain execution of IIP-17, the protocol can be unpaused and `deposit` and `rebalance` functions activated again.\n\nA more in-depth analysis will be made in the future on a possible fix that would allow \nflash loans to be offered in the Idle protocol without creating similar issues. A detailed description of the potential partners’ vulnerability is available in [this report](https://idlefinance.medium.com/potential-vulnerability-disclosure-2021-11-18-9bc0a2cdc0f2).\n\n\n### Details\nThe new implementation is available [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x577d963246d28dbe0dc579048adda421b054924a).\nThe code for the IIP is [here](https://github.com/Idle-Finance/idle-proposals/blob/main/scripts/iip-17.ts).\n\nWith one action still available in IIP-17, Dev League proposes to also include a minor update related to idleFEI Best-Yield (proxyAdmin update). This update is not related to the potential vulnerability fix described above.\n\nActions:\n* IdleToken update: 9 actions\n* idleFEI Best-Yield proxyAdmin update: 1 action\n\nThis IIP complies with the [stkIDLE Voting Framework](https://gov.idle.finance/t/voting-framework-for-stkidle-holders/567).\nOnly stkIDLE holders can vote on this poll.\n**Threshold to make the poll valid** (both metrics should be reached):\n- 30% of circulating stkIDLE voting the poll (min. 87’857 stkIDLE)\n- at least 70% on the same option\n\nIf the poll reaches the quorum, the community multisig will broadcast the decision on-chain.\nCurrent On-chain Voting Power: 393’232 $IDLE\n\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve IIP-17 execution\n**AGAINST**: Vote against IIP-17 execution\n",

The proposal already passed the [Temperature Check](https://gov.idle.finance/t/dydx-deactivation/695/3).\n\nIn regard to idleFEI, last week Idle Leagues introduced the idea of [enabling $IDLE farming for the FEI pool](https://gov.idle.finance/t/enable-idle-liquidity-mining-on-idlefei/696). With IIP-15 approval, the idleFEI pool will then be included in the $IDLE liquidity mining program and will dynamically receive $IDLE depending on TVL and APY of the pool.\nThe potential target market is $500m (circulating supply). The proposal already passed the [Temperature Check](https://gov.idle.finance/t/enable-idle-liquidity-mining-on-idlefei/696/8).\n\nThe third initiative proposed with IIP-15 is the [Cream removal from idleFEI pool](https://gov.idle.finance/t/remove-cream-from-idlefei-pool/709).\nCream protocol suffered a [$130m loss](https://decrypt.co/84590/cream-finance-suffers-third-hack-losing-over-130-million) on 27th October 2021, making it the third-largest DeFi hack in history. The attacker found a vulnerability in the platform’s lending system and used it to steal Cream’s assets. Following this incident, Cream can no longer be compatible with [Idle’s risk profile](https://gov.idle.finance/t/integration-standard-requirements/513) and Leagues propose to remove it from idleFEI (the only pool supporting it).\nThere are no material risks on Idle side, as the rebalancer already paused any possible Cream deposit, but this IIP would finalize the underlying protocol deactivation. The proposal already passed the [Temperature Check](https://gov.idle.finance/t/remove-cream-from-idlefei-pool/709/3).\n\nCheck the details of the motivations [here](https://gov.idle.finance/t/iip-15-remove-dydx-and-cream-add-idle-to-idlefei/713).\n\n### Details\n\nActions:\n* dYdX removal from Best-Yield DAI and USDC pools: 2 actions\n* $IDLE liquidity mining activation on idleFEI: 2 actions\n* Cream protocol removal from idleFEI: 1 action\n\nThis IIP complies with the [stkIDLE Voting Framework](https://gov.idle.finance/t/voting-framework-for-stkidle-holders/567).\nOnly stkIDLE holders can vote on this poll.\n**Threshold to make the poll valid** (both metrics should be reached):\n- 30% of circulating stkIDLE voting the poll (min. 84’127 stkIDLE)\n- at least 70% on the same option\n\nIf the poll reaches the quorum, the community multisig will broadcast the decision on-chain.\nCurrent On-chain Voting Power: 378’670 $IDLE\n\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve IIP-15 execution\n**AGAINST**: Vote against IIP-15 execution\n",

If Governance will approve this proposal, the idleFEI pool will then be included in the $IDLE liquidity mining program and will dynamically receive $IDLE depending on TVL and APY of the pool.\n\n$IDLE liquidity mining would allow Idle to attract a wide potential target market ($500m circulating supply). At the same time, the extension of $IDLE governance ownership to FEI LPs would represent a way to incentivize participation in the upcoming idleFEI tranches, built on top of the Best-Yield strategy.\n\nThe Fei community will then have access to the “neutral” Best-Yield, “protected” Senior Tranche, and “leveraged” Junior Tranche, expanding the suite of yield optimization products.\n\nThe collaboration with Fei DAO could further incentivize liquidity provision thanks to [TRIBE Liquidity Mining](https://tribe.fei.money/t/tribe-liquidity-mining-emission-schedule/3549) distributed via Tribal Chief Programs. Lastly, Fei DAO could also consider Idle as a yield source for its [$1b PCV allocation](https://app.fei.money/analytics), which is mainly deposited in Aave and Compound. \n\n\n### Details\nThe technical implementation will be developed by Dev League.\n\nActions:\n* idleFEI liquidity mining activation: 2 actions\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve $IDLE liquidity mining activation on IdleFEI\n**AGAINST**: Vote against $IDLE liquidity mining activation on IdleFEI\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

      "content": "### Summary\nThis proposal points out the reasons for removing the Risk-Adjusted strategy and replacing it with the built-in security features provided by the Senior tranche. The change would effectively provide risk protection, also solving inefficiencies currently generated by Risk-Adjusted pools.\n\nIf the proposal will pass the Temperature Check, Governance will vote on-chain to execute the deactivation of $IDLE LM from Risk-Adjusted pools.\n\n### IIP Motivation\nLaunched in [May 2020](https://idlefinance.medium.com/idle-v3-0-is-a-live-db568c534a09), the Risk-Adjusted automatically changes the asset allocation to find the optimal mix between risk scores and yield.\nThe strategy was designed for risk-averse profiles interested in lending funds with a comfortable level of risk, and supports DAI, USDC, USDT pools.\n\nWith the launch of [Perpetual Yield Tranches](https://idlefinance.medium.com/introducing-perpetual-yield-tranches-guarded-launch-phase-1-12978c25b0f0), Senior tranche represents the natural evolution of this security-first product. With this instrument, LPs can enjoy and participate in complex and exotic products, reducing the exposure to tail risks. Senior Tranches have a first lien on the underlying assets — they’re first in line to be repaid in case of default (hack, loss of funds).\n\nThese intrinsic features shape the suite of Idle products, making the Best-Yield the underlying core component of Senior and Junior classes. With that infrastructure, Risk-Adjusted pools do not represent a strategic component anymore and could be deactivated.\n\nFurthermore, DeFi Score does not support the latest pools implemented in Aave/Compound and reduced maintenance activities. This unavailability generates counterparty risks with no actual benefits.\n\nWith the deactivation of Risk-Adjusted, the $IDLE liquidity mining on all Best-Yield pools would increase by 1.7% (at the current speed rate, Risk-Adj gets 58 $IDLE and Best-Yield 3242 $IDLE; then 3300 $IDLE will be allocated only to Best-Yield), making the flagship strategy even more attractive.\n\n### Details\nThe technical implementation consists of:\n* $IDLE LM removal from DAI, USDC, USDT pools (3 on-chain actions)\n* Rebalance deactivation (no on-chain actions)\n* Strategy deposit disabled from UI (no on-chain actions)\n\nThe migration plan will incentivize users to withdraw funds from Risk-Adjusted pools, and the protocol would leave remaining assets in Compound (with no active rebalances) until LPs redeem all the funds. By the way, there is no possibility to lose funds or get funds stuck in Risk-Adjusted smart contracts, as LPs could always redeem them.\n\n*Incentivized Migration*:\nWith strategy deprecation, Governance can provide incentives (in $IDLE from Treasury League budget) for users that migrate from Risk-Adjusted ([DAI](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa14eA0E11121e6E951E87c66AFe460A00BCD6A16#balances), [USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0x28fAc5334C9f7262b3A3Fe707e250E01053e07b5#balances), [USDC](https://etherscan.io/token/0x3391bc034f2935ef0e1e41619445f998b2680d35#balances)) to Senior Tranche in a short period of time.\nThe reward would cover the risks of joining a product with a relatively short track record, even if the new pools would intrinsically embed fund protection.\n\nThe proposal introduces a proportional incentive, 0.5% of the nominal USD value at block 13275150, capped at $1k per individual reward.\nThe maximum allocated budget would be about $9k (only if all users migrate).\nThe incentivization phase would last for the entire $5m-cap period, until the reach of the cap limit.\nThe incentivized migration would act as a bridge to help current LPs while also generating new strategic value from the DAO perspective.\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve the proposal and initiative the on-chain IIP\n**AGAINST**: Vote against the proposal\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n",

      "content": "### Summary\nThis proposal aims to introduce 3 phases that could empower Idle Governance to foster liquidity provision and enhance swap volumes, with Phase 1 being the main object of this Temperature Check.\n\nThis poll would gauge community sentiment on Phase 1, which consists of $120k UNI v3 liquidity deployment on Ethereum and the approval of a 20k $IDLE LP staking program on Polygon.\n\n### Motivation\n*Key facts on Ethereum network*\nThe Treasury League is actively working on getting Idle listed as a collateral asset on different lending protocols. $IDLE recently got approved to be added to the Fuse pool and a current blocker is the required price oracle (TWAP) for the ETH/IDLE pair. As we do not have a Chainlink price feed yet, the Fuse team would be more comfortable with a UNI v3 TWAP instead of a Sushi one, but the current UNI v3 pool is illiquid. Fuse requires to have at least $120k liquidity in UNI v3 directly owned by the Governance, with guarantees that those funds would not be removed.\n\n*Key facts on Polygon network*\nWith the approval of the [$700k program](https://gov.idle.finance/t/proposal-idle-and-polygon-700k-partnership-to-jointly-scale-defi-yield-aggregation/647) with Polygon, Idle Leagues are working on the deployment phase.\nThe launch could get visibility within the Polygon community, but users would be forced to use ETH markets if they would like to become token holders.\nA Polygon pool would enable community members to swap tokens with cheap tx fees, increasing the volumes and attracting prospective token holders blocked by ETH expensive tx costs. On the other side, Governance functions would be available only on Ethereum network.\n\nA detailed description of the motivations is [available here](https://gov.idle.finance/t/3-phase-proposal-to-foster-liquidity-provision-lp-staking-analysis/681).\n\n### Details\nThe Treasury League proposes the following implementation phases:\n\n*Ethereum side*\nDeployment of $120k liquidity in UNI v3 (IDLE/ETH pool).\n[Ecosystem Fund](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb0aa1f98523ec15932dd5faac5d86e57115571c7) and [SushiCollector](https://etherscan.io/address/0x076ff8e6402b02855ff82119b53e59bbdd67f0ee) (already managed by Treasury League) could fund the 50-50 pool with 10,000 $IDLE and $60k from the $SUSHI reserve. The operation requires 1 on-chain action, with funds deployed via Treasury League multisig.\n\n*Polygon side*\nDesign of a Polygon LP staking program, with the aim of attracting $1m in liquidity. According to this simulation tool provided by [Mechanism Capital](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fchtxg6hq2gBC4WcMoQ8OFgMv84BZLDIT5pOm9Z18w4/edit#gid=656976389), that liquidity would allow $10k token swap with 2% slippage. In combination with cheap tx fees, users can get easy access to $IDLE.\nThe expected budget allocated to this initiative would be 20k IDLE for a 3-month program.\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve the proposal, initiate fund transfer and LP staking operations\n**AGAINST**: Vote against the proposal\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal\n",

      "content": "### Summary\nThis IIP would execute a series of minor bug fixes reported in the past months, increasing the robustness of IdleTokens and improving the oracle infrastructure. [The post](https://gov.idle.finance/t/iip-13-code-improvements-and-flash-loan-fee-adjustment/680) proposes to decrease the Flash Loan fee to 0.02%, introducing more competitive advantages for either Ethereum layer and the upcoming Polygon release.\n\nThe proposal will have to pass the Temperature Check before starting the on-chain journey.\n\n### IIP Motivation\nAn [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bounty/idlefinance/) security researcher reached out to signal  the Idle protocol was using a deprecated method on 2 oracles (used by idleController and idleTokens) that might have led to stale data behavior.\n\nLeagues agreed to pay a [$500 bounty](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x19e08c21d928ef4ca109ea9ac391e661be43ec206b27274e468b4dea79e96e49) to that researcher.\n\nThe Dev League fixed the bug and released PriceOracleV3, a forked version of the previous code. Devs improved the oracle, making it upgradable and generating a single shared version used by idleController and idleTokens. In this way, one upgrade action would be able to execute any further change.\n\nThe owner of this oracle is the Governance Timelock.\nOracle Address: [0x758C10272A15f0E9D50Cbc035ff9a046945da0F2](https://etherscan.io/address/0x758C10272A15f0E9D50Cbc035ff9a046945da0F2)\n\nThere are also a couple of small fixes in the IdleTokenGovernance rebalance method for:\n* A possible revert during the activation/deactivation of new underlying protocols: [Github commit](https://github.com/Idle-Labs/idle-contracts/commit/542eeec640842db1c0bb6e80e23424749a47e4a4#diff-082b7fb522c8943f7893a03dc6135c3d98adfd3305dd3b90140dd96fb33e874de)\n* A possible revert when redeeming all funds altogether from Compound-like protocols: [Github commit](https://github.com/Idle-Labs/idle-contracts/commit/ede007220e0f2db4eb2c9fc9119ba71202f54e1e#diff-082b7fb522c8943f7893a03dc6135c3d98adfd3305dd3b90140dd96fb33e874d)\n\nThe idleController oracle update would embed the Flash Loan fee change.\nThe current fee is 0.08%, and this IIP proposes to reduce it to 0.02%. This change would allow Idle protocol to become the cheapest FL provider on Polygon (vs [Unilend 0.05%](https://docs.unilend.finance/the-protocol/flash-loan)) and compete with MakerDAO on Ethereum.\n\n### Details\nThe technical implementation is available [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xea091ed7146e2c3cf3ac11fa296e206e55177b30) and was developed by Dev League.\n\nActions:\n* Implementation and oracle address update on Best-Yield idleTokens (8 actions)\n* idleController oracle address update and Flash Loan fee change (1 action)\n\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve the proposal and initiate the on-chain IIP-13\n**AGAINST**: Vote against the proposal\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the proposal",

Afterward, with RAI approved and available on Aave, this yield source became part of idleRAI as well.\nIn mid July, idleRAI passed the Integration Standard Requirements and got approved for Production stage. Governance unanimously approved the extension of the $IDLE LM program to idleRAI via [Temperature Check](https://gov.idle.finance/t/enable-idle-farming-for-the-rai-pool-2/576).\n\nLately, the Governance also [agreed on removing Cream](https://gov.idle.finance/t/proposal-remove-cream-from-the-rai-aggregator/603) from the list of supported yield sources in this pool. One action of this IIP will be dedicated to stkAAVE farming, approved by [Aave Governance](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/QmeHAwW7XwUD3vqYLMRPF8MJiXkj2nnbRg1ae7mZ1SNQdm).\n\nThe second batch of transactions is related to Leagues’ next mandate funding. Governance approved via [Temperature Check](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-leagues-v2-0-leagues-labs-mandate-3/584) to allocate $104’300 + 16’183 IDLE to fund operations, scaling activities, and compensations.\nAn additional $4k is required to cover ETHglobal hackathon prizes, not executed during the previous mandate.\n\n### Details\nThe technical implementation was developed by Dev League.\n\nActions:\n- idleRAI liquidity mining activation: 4 actions\n- $RAI support on FeeCollector: 1 action\n- Cream removal from idleRAI: 1 action\n- stkAAVE support on idleRAI: 1 action\n- ETH transfer from FeeTreasury to Treasury League: 1 action\n- stkAAVE transfer from FeeCollector to Treasury League: 1 action\n- $IDLE transfer from Ecosystem Fund to Treasury League: 1 action\n\nThis IIP complies with the stkIDLE Voting Framework. Only stkIDLE holders can vote on this poll.\n\nThreshold to make the poll valid (both metrics should be reached):\n- 30% of circulating stkIDLE voting the poll (min.71’996 stkIDLE)\n- at least 70% on the same option\n\nIf the poll will reach the quorum, the community multisig will broadcast the decision on-chain.\nCurrent On-chain Voting Power: 378'898 $IDLE\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\nFOR: Approve IIP-12 execution\nAGAINST: Vote against IIP-12 execution",

The max program duration is 6 months: Idle Governance would give back any unused funds to the Polygon team after that period.\n\nIf Idle protocol reaches $300m TVL via partners’ deposits during the program, the Polygon team will commit an additional **$1.35m** in $MATIC to extend the program for 6 months more.\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve $50k allocation from Ecosystem fund and partner with Polygon\n**AGAINST**: Do nothing\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

This would make the aggregator deploy capital only in Fuse Pool 9 and Aave v2.\n\n## Details\n\nThe Reflexer community expressed their preference to focus RAI capital in protocols such as Fuse and Aave. Currently, the Idle aggregator tends to allocate too much capital in CREAM. Many RAI lenders mentioned that they are not comfortable with CREAM’s protocol risk, even hinting that they will stop using Idle RAI altogether if the situation isn’t improved.\n\nGiven that Idle governance just voted in IDLE rewards for RAI alongside the current FLX rewards given to depositors, we should strive to keep the community happy and hopefully attract even more capital.\n\n## Voting Options\n\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options to decide if we remove CREAM from the RAI aggregator:\n\n1.

      "content": "### Summary\nThis off-chain poll aims to gauge the sentiment among stkIDLE holders regarding [IIP-11](https://gov.idle.finance/t/iip-11-deprecate-aave-v1/597), which has been [launched on-chain](https://idle.finance/#/governance/proposals/11).\nIf the poll will reach the quorum, the vote will be broadcasted on-chain.\n\nThis IIP would execute Aave v1 deprecation and transfers 4’105.7 $IDLE to Leagues multisig as reimbursement for B2B affiliation program payout, allowing the committee to finalize past mandate’s operations.\n\n### IIP Motivation\nIn February, Idle Governance discussed [Aave v2 wrapper integration](https://gov.idle.finance/t/eth-aave-implementation-and-security-review-kick-off/291) and implemented it in idleDAI, idleUSDC, idleUSDT, idleSUSD, idleTUSD, idleWBTC, and idleWETH Best-Yield pools via [IIP-5](https://gov.idle.finance/t/iip5-bounty-to-emiliano-bonassi-idle-farming-activation-for-the-weth-pool-aave-v2-wrapper-implementation/358).\n\nIdle protocol is currently supporting both Aave v1 and v2, but it has not allocated funds on v1 for weeks due to a lack of incentives. This is favorable timing to execute the old version’s dismission because the pool no longer represents an underlying lending source.\n\nThis [forum post](https://gov.idle.finance/t/deprecate-aave-v1/565) illustrates the rationale behind Aave v1 deprecation, and the Governance voted [via Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth/proposal/QmQi5cofpEgnzDhBwgL6cAUKWoxbt3WBuB6pMNexsTkPFF) to approve this change.\n\nThis IIP consists of 9 actions, 6 used for Best-Yield pools and 3 for Risk-Adjusted ones, and the 10th slot transfers 4’105.7 $IDLE to Leagues multisig.\nAs reported in [Treasury League – Budget Extension](https://gov.idle.finance/t/treasury-league-budget-extension/587), this amount would refund Leagues for the B2B affiliation program payout, not included in the previous Leagues’ budget but directly executed by the committee for the sake of simplicity. In this way, Leagues can complete the payout for expenses related to the past mandate.\n\n\n### Details\nThe technical implementation is reported in the [on-chain IIP](https://idle.finance/#/governance/proposals/11), developed by Dev League\n\nThis IIP complies with the [stkIDLE Voting Framework](https://gov.idle.finance/t/voting-framework-for-stkidle-holders/567). Only stkIDLE holders can vote on this poll.\n\n**Threshold to make the poll valid** (both metrics should be reached):\n- 30% of circulating stkIDLE voting the poll (min. 56'141 stkIDLE)\n- at least 70% on the same option\n\nIf the poll will reach the quorum, the community multisig will broadcast the decision on-chain.\nCurrent On-chain Voting Power: 302'239.8518 $IDLE\n\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**FOR**: Approve IIP-11 execution\n**AGAINST**: Vote against IIP-11 execution\n",

Idle’s Liquidity Mining program linearly distributes 2,340,000 IDLE (0.5 IDLE per block) until 26th November 2022. We therefore would like to officialize the ongoing Reflexer rewards program for the same duration as our liquidity mining program. IdleRAI depositors would then be able to receive both $IDLE and $FLX rewards until the end of Idle's Liquidity Mining program. \n\nThis Temperature Check complies with the [stkIDLE Voting Framework](https://gov.idle.finance/t/voting-framework-for-stkidle-holders/567).

      "content": "### Summary\nThis Snapshot poll aims to establish:\n- the Leagues V2 structure, introducing a refined organizational infrastructure to foster cross-Leagues cooperation\n- mandate budget and duration\n\nFor more detailed information regarding the new Leagues-Labs structure and budget breakdown, [check the forum post](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-leagues-v2-0-leagues-labs-mandate-3/584).\n\n### Motivation\nWith the last mandate and the engagement of the Idle community, we now have 3 different Leagues that work on protocol and strategy development, treasury and business management, and communication & marketing operations.\nWith the next mandate, we want to re-confirm this structure and the contributors working on it, and officially incorporate the C&M League body after the initial pilot program.\nThe new teams’ structure will use a **Contributors-Advisors structure** (formerly PMs-Supervisors) with specialized areas of responsibility.\n\n### Details\n**Leagues-Labs Matrix Structure**\nThe Leagues-Labs model is focused on simplicity and cross-Leagues cooperation. When multiple and different Leagues members coordinate with each other on the same feature area, they form a Lab. Labs help build alignment across Leagues and aim to maintain it over the course of an initiative workflow.\n\n**Compensation Packages**\nWe feel that the compensation packages proposed during the last mandate have been broadly accepted and helped us find great talents within our community.\nInsofar, we would like to propose the same level of compensation, with the only addition of using [Opyn Vesting Options](https://gist.github.com/alexisgauba/cf055f521bcfded018116f3f37074f67) on the IDLE bonus part. This would act as an additional incentive for Leagues members to reach major achievements, similar to equity options that startups typically use to incentivize employees.\n\n**Mandate Budget and Duration**\nIn May, the Treasury League received 11k IDLE as new budget and 5k IDLE from the past League mandate.\nIn addition, at the mandate initiation, the Dev League received $20,000 in ETH for technical operations and deployments - the wallet still holds $18k (6.4 ETH).\n\nHaving Treasury League reserves entirely in IDLE has exposed the budget to extreme market fluctuations, underperforming during the past months. Furthermore, the counterparties we have been working with often accepted only stablecoins, and the sole workaround available to us was to have Idle Labs managing the payments.\n\nThis time, the planned Treasury League’s budget would use stablecoins as a unit of account for operational expenses and stablecoins/IDLE ratios for compensations.\n\nIdle Labs would like to begin a process of integration of part of the core team with the DAO, merging the genesis team with the Leagues structure. Idle Labs members will forego the compensations for the next mandate and expenses reported below include only rewards for contributors not affiliated with Idle Labs. More details in the [proposal to re-confirm the current Leagues’ team members](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-leagues-v2-0-current-team-reconfirmation/585).\n\nThe Leagues would like to allocate the following amounts to the respective Leagues’ multisigs:\n**Treasury League**: $84.3k in stablecoins ($50k operational costs, $34.3k compensations) + 16’183 IDLE (compensations);\n**Dev League**: $0, as the committee can self-sustain future expenses with current reserves\n**C&M League**: $30k in stablecoins\n\nA detailed breakdown of the fund allocation is reported here: [Budget Projection Mandate #3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sD5k7DmTWC4Y_fJlFue8ZB1ItpZl0mYV0H3N6CQNpM8/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nCurrent Idle DAO reserves (non-IDLE assets) and final reserves after Leagues funding are reported below (with market values at the time of writing):\nFeeTreasury: $91'000 (ETH + others)\nFeeCollector: $58'000 (stkAAVE + others)\nLP staking: $21'000 (SUSHI)\nSmart Treasury: $99'500 (ETH)\nTotal: $269'500\nLeague expenses: $104'300\nReserves after Leagues funding: $165'200\n\nLastly, the proposed mandate duration is 3 months.\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**IN FAVOR**: Approve the Leagues V2 structure, mandate budget and duration\n**AGAINST**: Not proceed with this proposal\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the structure, budget and duration\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

With this in mind, we are proposing a revised structure for the positions and responsibilities of each current Leagues member.\n\n### Current Members and New Positions\n**Treasury League**\n* @Salome\n* **Current position**: Mid-level PM (full-time)\n* **Next mandate position**: Mid-level Contributor (part-time) for business development and ecosystem development\n* @EmixPrime\n* **Current position**: Mid-level PM (full-time)\n* **Next mandate position**: Mid-level Contributor (full-time) for ecosystem development and DAO architecture and facilitation\n* @RT P\n* **Current position**: Supervisor \n* **Next mandate position**: Senior Contributor level 1 (part-time) for ecosystem development & DAO architecture and facilitation\n* @ETM612\n* **Current position**: Supervisor\n* **Next mandate position**: Advisor for ecosystem development and token economy\n* @Teo\n* **Current position**: Supervisor\n* **Next mandate position**: Senior Contributor level 2 (full-time) for business development and DAO architecture and facilitation\n* @Davide\n* **Current position**: Supervisor\n* **Next mandate position**: Senior Contributor level 1 (full-time) for business development and token economy\n\n**Development League**\n* @8bitporkchop\n* **Current position**: Mid-level Dev (part-time)\n* **Next mandate position**: Mid-level Dev (part-time) for smart contract development\n* @William\n* **Current position**: Supervisor\n* **Next mandate position**: Senior Dev level 2 (full-time) for smart contract development\n* @gravityblast\n* **Current position**: Supervisor\n* **Next mandate position**: Advisor for smart contract development\n* @samster91\n* **Current position**: Supervisor (or Idle Labs product manager)\n* **Next mandate position**: Advisor for product management\n\n**C&M League**\n*  @DenisDevcic\n* **Current position**: Pilot program PM\n* **Next mandate position**: Mid-level Contributor (full-time) for product marketing management \n*  @mikojava\n* **Current position**: Pilot program PM\n* **Next mandate position**: Advisor\n* @Teo\n* **Current position**: Supervisor\n* **Next mandate position**: Advisor\n\n### Side note for Idle Labs members\nAs Idle Labs (the genesis team and company), we would like to begin a process of integration of part of the core team (founders + Idle Labs contractors) into the DAO – the goal here is to ultimately dissolve the company and have all the active contributors for the Idle Protocol working for the DAO.\n\nAs part of the founding team, we will always commit ourselves to the long-term success of the protocol and DAO, with respect to our internal token and governance [policy](https://gov.idle.finance/t/idle-labs-team-policy-and-governance-participation/207). \n\nFurthermore, we (Idle Labs members: @Teo, @william, @samster91, @Davide, @gravityblast) would like to forego the next mandate’s compensation for our positions in order to boost the growth of the Leagues-Labs structure and allow more active community contributors to join the Leagues, scaling initiatives, and growth for the protocol.\n\n### Voting Options\n\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n\n* **IN FAVOR**: Re-confirm the current Leagues’ team members with renewed positions \n* **AGAINST**: Not proceed with re-confirmation\n\nThis poll is available for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\nThe final $IDLE voting weights will be calculated using the [approved framework](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BnH9boRmBADuyquvDMh0AmQfF97Zj76sIENKtySLU8o/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

      "content": "### Summary\nThis Temperature Check aims to define the frameworks that [allow stkIDLE holders to vote off-chain and on-chain proposals](https://gov.idle.finance/t/voting-framework-for-stkidle-holders/567).\nWhen [on-chain proposals](https://idle.finance/#/governance) are live, an [off-chain poll for stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth) will mirror the on-chain question. There are two possible options to set the poll’s thresholds that make on-chain vote broadcasting valid.\nWhen [off-chain polls](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) are launched, an [off-chain poll for stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth) will mirror the off-chain question. This proposed solution would aggregate the stkIDLE votes with the ones cast by $IDLE token holders.\n\n### Motivation\nWith the launch of $IDLE staking, stakers have no more access to voting features.\nTo enable the on-chain voting option, the governance tokens deposited into the staking contract are delegated to a community multisig.\nThe implementation of an ad-hoc off-chain voting strategy lets stkIDLE holders cast their preference for on-chain proposals, and a community multisig is in charge of on-chain vote broadcasting once the off-chain polls reach the thresholds, voting with its entire balance.\n\nThe same off-chain ad-hoc voting strategy can be used to let stkIDLE holders cast their preference for off-chain polls.\n\n### Details\nON-CHAIN VOTES\n**Voting strategy**: [stkIDLE holders voting space](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\n**Threshold to make the poll valid**:\n- *Option 1*: low quorum (30% of stkIDLE) but high consensus (70%+ on the same choice). This option would require a minimum of 21% of stkIDLE voting the same thing. A lower barrier to entry would allow the Governance to reach the 520,000 $IDLE quorum on on-chain proposals easily. Drawback: a tiny group can potentially pivot a large number of votes.\n- *Option 2*: high quorum (60% of stkIDLE) but low consensus (51% on the same choice). This option would require a minimum of 31% of stkIDLE voting the same thing. Benefit: the parameters require a large voting base, so the final vote can not be influenced by few individuals.\nDrawback: if the poll does not meet the quorum, the vote is not broadcasted and this voting power can not help the Governance reaching the 520,000 $IDLE quorum.\n**Voting weight**: 100% of the staked $IDLE voting weight\n\nOFF-CHAIN VOTES\n**Voting strategy**: [stkIDLE holders voting space](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\n**Threshold to make the poll valid**: no quorum required\n**Voting weight**: the voting stkIDLE amount is calculated in the form of weighted IDLE tokens using the formula: “total IDLE staked / total stkIDLE minted * total stkIDLE voting the snapshot * % of each option”\n\nThe sum of the voting weights cast by $IDLE and stkIDLE holders represents the final snapshot results.\n\nThis poll is the first one launched for both [$IDLE token holders](https://snapshot.org/#/idlefinance.eth) and [stkIDLE holders](https://snapshot.org/#/staking.idlefinance.eth).\n\n### Voting Options\nPlease cast your vote on one of the following options:\n**OPTION 1**: Approve option 1 for on-chain stkIDLE vote broadcasting and the proposed solution for off-chain polls\n**OPTION 2**: Approve option 2 for on-chain stkIDLE vote broadcasting and the proposed solution for off-chain polls\n**DISCUSS MORE**: Discuss more the on-chain and off-chain Voting Framework for stkIDLE holders\n**AGAINST**: Not proceed with this proposal\n",
