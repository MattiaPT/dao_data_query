      "content": "# FarCon x BuilderDAO \n## tl:dr: Support FarCon event in May 2024 with 2 side event sponsorships and swag. \n\n![](https://imagedelivery.net/BXluQx4ige9GuW0Ia56BHw/2946da09-92a7-4ea2-64b5-b73d46581000/rectcontain3)\n\nFor the inaugural FarCon in June 2023, BuilderDAO was one of the few sponsors and saw an amazing impact from that decision. With only 70 attendees at this first FarCon, not only did we see new members join, but we were able to proliferate the platform and have since seen many new members who have joined BuilderDAO and DAOs built on Nouns Builder come directly from Warpcast. This was a hugely successful proliferation.\n\nThis prop suggests doubling our efforts for FarCon 2024 May 1-5, as this event will be 7x the size and more than that in attention and live stream viewing, with multiple side events and an hackathon added to the summit. See https://farcon.xyz/ for more info. \n\nI have been discussing needs with the FarCon team, and the following is proposed based on their needs:\n\n2 eth for FarHack hackathon support and sponsorship\n2.5 eth to sponsor a premier side event (GM Farcaster live stream at the Nouns Cafe)\n3.5 for custom purple noggles and Nouns Builder swag\n\n**FarHack hackathon**: May 3-5 \"the ultimate farcaster hackathon to learn how to build cool farcaster sh*t with cool farcaster people — with 24 hours to start building it and all the hands-on support you may need.\" more info here - https://farhack.xyz/\n\n**GM Farcaster live at Nouns Cafe**: the only official nounish event will be a live stream of GM Farcaster podcast's 100th episode with hosts @nounishprof and @adrienne and a special interview with Farcaster founders @dwr and @v. This will be live from the new Nouns Cafe, owned by The Park's Derek G. Taylor. After the interview, there will be a Bagels & Builders BuilderDAO meetup. 2.5 eth is requested to support the event food & beverage and other expenses. BuilderDAO will be a featured sponsor for this event.\n\n**Purple Noggles**: at last year's FarCon, prof had a few noggles from MotivateMe and they were by far the most coveted swag. This year, MotivateMe has coordinated with his supplier to create purple noggles exclusively for BuilderDAO. This custom run of 1800 noggles will be used for BuilderDAO events throughout the year, starting with 1000 for FarCon. Some additional stickers, temporary tattoos and other items will be added to the noggle packaging to ensure credit back to BuilderDAO.\n\nIn addition, prof will be submitting an application for a reprise panel on DAOs as an update to last year's panel at FarCon 2023.\n\n![](https://farhack.xyz/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2FfarhackLogo.da6339db.png&w=256&q=75)\n\n# **Northstar Check**\n\n## **Builder DAO is dedicated to the creation and development of free and accessible DAO infrastructure as a public good.**\n\nThis proposal furthers that mission by ensuring visibility and profliferation to our main target audience. The ROI for this level of exposure should be significant. This not only proliferates BuilderDAO but gives support to two of our most successful DAOs: Purple and The Park.\n\n\n## **Treasury Impact**\n\nTotal ask is 8eth and the treasury impact is minimal.\n\n\n## **Transactions**\n\n2 eth for FarHack to FarCon team at: 0x5e1b182e53f44a72E556FD1dAE0C24A077Cfbe38\n\n2.5 eth for Nouns Cafe event directly to Nouns Cafe team at: dddvvv.eth \n\n3.5 eth for purple noggles and swag to BuilderDAO.theNounishProf.eth for payment to MotivateMe and ordering of other swag: 0xF83426084B93adCA5A3c8630032e007038823b4d\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryudQqi83.jpg)\n\n\n",

      "content": "## Fund L2 DAO Migration\n\nNow that Bali has been launched we can begin migrating DAOs from L1 to L2. We currently have 6 DAOs interested in migration:\n- Purple\n- The Park\n- Builder DAO\n- BLVKHVND\n- Nouns DAO Africa\n- Lil Toadz\n\n### Funding request\nFor a DAO to fully migrate there are a few technical automations we have built out to make the experience as smooth as possible. These automations include relaying bridged transactions, setting artwork attributes and airdropping tokens to DAO members. \n\nFor a large DAO ie Purple or Builder the total gas cost is around 6,317,460 L1 gas for all L2 migration transactions. This means to sponsor one large DAO migration costs approximately:\n- 0.063 ETH @ 10 gwei gas (144 USD @ 2300 ETH/USD)\n- 0.126 ETH @ 20 gwei gas (289 USD @ 2300 ETH/USD)\n- 0.189 ETH @ 30 gwei gas (434 USD @ 2300 ETH/USD)\n- 0.252 ETH @ 50 gwei gas (579 USD @ 2300 ETH/USD)\n\nA funding request of **3 ETH** would allow us to migrate about **15 - 30 DAOs** at current gas prices.\n\n### Funding source\n\nWe propose to use 3 ETH from the OPs working group multisig on Base. address: **0x2bAf638C651fb8AB5fB024Df680Be0D5323a2488**\n\nUpon successfully passing this proposal the 3 ETH will be sent to a wallet the migration bot uses to send transactions: **0xf9c4F85BAf81F854d36a3a75113f33b163cad2a7**. Funds will be sent to Base, Zora and Optimism networks as needed depending on where DAOs choose to migrate. \n\nIf funds are not fully used ie less than 15 - 30 DAOs migrate they will be returned to BuilderDAO. If funds run out and more DAOs want to migrate we will submit a followup proposal for a second funding request.\n\n*This proposal includes a 0.00001 ETH transfer to put this proposal onchain.*",

      "content": "# Move BuilderDAO to Base!\n\n## tl:dr: With L2 migration now available for Nouns Builder with the Bali upgrade, let's move BuilderDAO to Base!\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkIOJ9jL2.jpg)\n\nTwo informal polls were taken in January as a temp check to see which L2 - Optimism, Base or Zora - BuilderDAO should move to. The results were overwhelmingly in favor of Base. The Base team has been incredibly supportive of BuilderDAO and the DAOs built on Nouns Builder already giving grants to BuilderDAO, Based Management, Based Nouns and Yellow Collective. Beyond the financial component, Jesse Pollak and the Base team have assisted each of these DAOs, as well as numerous other projects, to amplify and cut through the noise to reach a wider audience.  \n\nBase is built on the Optimism stack. By moving to Base, we incorporate both Base & Optimism. Base projects are fully eligible for RPGF, as they are part of Optimism. Last cycle, Base projects received 10 million $OP.\n\nBase *is* Optimism. For more, read \"Base’s Commitment to Decentralization with the Superchain\" here: https://base.mirror.xyz/aBwt4flT1WAKJGQTj2AXBpH_8Qd3umQ-ZECLAJoO_nE.\n\nIn line with BuilderDAO's north star, Base funds public goods. A portion of the Base revenue goes to RPGF as well as having an active grants programs funding public goods, with lots of data points on the impact. Base has complete vision alignment with BuilderDAO. \n\n**Base is for builders is their tagline.** \n\nThis proposal will ratify the decision to move to Base and lay out a launch plan including a 4eth budget for the following:\n\n* Within two weeks of this passed proposal, BuilderDAO will migrate to the Base L2 with assistance of the BuilderDAO tech pod.\n* Each BuilderDAO member will be airdropped a Base version of their BuilderDAO token 1 for 1. \n* Burned tokens will NOT be reissued.\n* The original DAO's auctions will be paused with this proposal.\n* A strategic launch plan that involves not only BuilderDAO but other Nouns Builder DAOs on Base will proceed as follows:\n    * **Week prior** (week of Feb 26): \n        * Prop House for mini grant round for creative ideas for launch week with 5 .2 eth grants. These may include other art mints, games, written contributions, etc.\n        * BuilderBox used as announcement of launch week plans\n    * **Monday**: Twitter Spaces launch party! in conjunction with The Nouns Square during Noun O' Clock (estimated 11 am ET) to share details on launch events for the week.\n    * **Monday**: BuilderDAO BasePaint theme for 24 hours. BuilderDAO agrees to mint 1 eth worth of the resulting art with one to each BuilderDAO member (1 per wallet). Additional art will be distributed as giveaways during launch week. We'll also give away 5 paintbrushes randomly to 5 BuilderDAO holders.  \n    * **Tuesday**: BuilderDAO themed Speedtracer track on Base with prizes for the top 10 on the leaderboard (Base merch and airdrops of the art commissioned for this launch week). \n    * **Wednesday**: Yellow Collective Art Contest - imagine BuilderDAO art on Base - with winners minted as an open edition on Base via Zora with a gamified 1st minter experience. Contest will begin the week before with voting by Yellow Collective and BuilderDAO holders. Winning art will be revealed on Wednesday. Creator rewards from free mint: 60% to artist; 20% to Yellow Collective; 20% to BuilderDAO.\n    * **Thursday**: Special drop with an artist or artists from Based Management as an open edition(s) on Base via Zora with a gamified 1st minter experience. Creator rewards from free mint will be split as followed: 60% to artists; 20% to Based Management; 20% to BuilderDAO. \n    * **Thursday**: BuilderDAO all hands voice call in the discord at 5 pm ET.\n    * **Friday**: Happy Friday with The Park! Special drop with the Park revealed during BuilderBox at 12:30 pm on Unlonely with a chat with Jesse Pollak. Creator rewards from free mint will be split as followed: 80% to The Park; 20% to BuilderDAO.\n    * **Friday**: Premiere of BuilderDAO mini doc by deebee including release of mint of the video.\n    * **Friday**: Announcement and launch of first Prop House for DAOs launched on Base to begin.\n\nAdditional activations will be incorporated from the Prop House round the week before.\n\nLaunch week will be tentatively scheduled for the week after Eth Denver (March 5 to 9) with announcements and promotion during Eth Denver. This may be adjusted if needed and assumes all migration is complete. This prop also includes launch support with Zamees - more details of that plan can be found here: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1IIm9XFVZ4ghTerm3aEV5XKX7jHl6eTTSX8CycfSILf4/edit?usp=sharing\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkVFW9sU2.jpg)\n\n# **Northstar Check**\n\n## Powering Onchain Communities.\n\nThe BuilderDAO mission is to develop DAO infrastructure as a public good, enabling decentralized, inclusive, and transparent decision-making processes that empower onchain communities to shape their collective futures.\n\nThis proposal furthers that mission by moving BuilderDAO to an L2 where we anticipate greater voter participation by DAO members. By creating a launch week plan, we can better promote the opportunities for DAOs on Nouns Builder as well as showcase BuilderDAO and some of our other DAOs that are also on Base. \n\n\n## **Budget and Treasury Impact**\n\n**Budget:**\n\n* BasePaint: 1 eth for minting and brushes\n* Yellow Collective art contest: .5 eth\n* Based Management art commission: .5 eth\n* The Park drop commission: .5 eth\n* Launch support, outreach, messaging: .5\n* Prop House for BuilderDAO pre-launch week: 1 eth\n* Prop House for DAOs on Base: Base grant already secured and currently held in a Base safe here: \n0x2bAf638C651fb8AB5fB024Df680Be0D5323a2488\n\n **4 eth total for launch**\n\n\n## **Transactions**\n\n**Summary of all transactions** \n\nPause Auctions\n\n.5 to Yellow Collective eth multisig:\n0x73c19e2A309400724689103A5BA483511C09633e\n\n.5 to The Park treasury (eth): \n0x673d37b930397c0defb51237e6fc42fed87b722f\n\n.5 to Zamees for marketing support:\n0x1Ef497229A7c841C21Cd1E3bcE28c5F4c2783130\n\n1 eth for BasePaint: held in builderdaoprophouse.thenounishprof.eth for minting (needs to be swapped to Base eth)\n\n.5 Base Management to builderdaoprophouse.thenounishprof.eth for swap to Base eth and then to Based Management treasury.\n\n1 eth for BuilderDAO prop house held in builderdaoprophouse.thenounishprof.eth for distribution to winners.\n\n(2.5 to 0x5830a01C8b0990DF46274f689AAab506A57337d9 -- builderdaoprophouse.thenounishprof.eth) \n\n4 eth total\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryudQqi83.jpg)\n\n\n",

As we move to the L2 migration period post Bali, some focus will move there.  In the next three months, my plan is to:\n\n* Support the Bali launch and L2 migration by working with the techpod and DAO members to ensure a smooth transition and promote the new upgrade to existing DAOs and new opportunities.\n* Continue supporting the community via Discord, BuilderDAO channel on Warpcast, Office Hours, DAO meetings and IRL activations.\n* Prop House: We'll have three or four prop houses over the next three months to support the L2 migration effort and seed daos with mini grants. I'll manage these prop houses from launch, execution and promotion.\n* Eth Denver: I am working on an Eth Denver sponsorship of the Farcaster meetup and also am applying for a panel about Nouns Builder. More info to follow in a separate prop once details are confirmed.\n* FarCon: plans are in the works for the next FarCon later this year and I am coordinating with the planning team to see how we can support the effort and bring some attention to BuilderDAO and Nouns Builder.\n* BuilderBox: we have moved BuilderBox to Unlonely! In order to reach a broader audience, I'll be streaming BuilderBox every other week on Unlonely and the recording will be released as a bonus episode on the TNS Zero Pod feed. Episode 1 of this effort was completed this past Friday with Chris Carella as the guest. In addition, GM Farcaster has become another media opportunity to reach a new audience and with discussions around Nouns Builder/Purple  as part of organic discussions around the Farcaster ecosystem.\n* Warpcast channel: I now have the channel lead access for the BuilderDAO channel and have been able to boost casts and hide those that are off topic. This will allow for greater visibility of important casts.\n* Token-gated group chats have just launched on Warpcast. I'll be launching an opt-in chat to allow for another method of contact and communication.\n* We'll be refreshing the current BotFrens content from BuilderDAO and adding to it. This may be in confunction with others who assist in this effort.\n* One activation I still need to complete is the onchain DAO games. It is ready to go but requires good timing so I hope to complete this by early March.\n\nA lot of my time is spent chatting in dm's and one on one to address concerns or ideas and that will continue as well but I am trying to direct those who have questions to join me in office hours whenever possible. As we move into this period after the Bali upgrade, I anticipate more one on one conversations and smaller group discussions will be necessary to facilitate these migrations.\n\n---\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/C0KGnpU.jpg)\n\n\n### North Star Check\n* All activities noted above help either to amplify the activities of BuilderDAO or educate around the Nouns Builder protocol, in alignment with BuilderDAO's mission.\n\n---\n\nFunding request: 9 eth total for the community resident for the three month period of January-March. \n\n*\n**Transaction: **\n9 eth to: theNounishProf.eth: 0xCEEd9585854F12F81A0103861b83b995A64AD915\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "## Deploy Bali to L2\n\nThis is a proposal to deploy the Builder Protocol upgrade \"Bali\" to the following L2 networks\n- Optimism mainnet\n- Base mainnet\n- Zora mainnet\n\n**This proposal includes no upgrade transactions as the L2 deployments are currently managed by the tech pod multisig (Neokry, Zaak, Valcoholics and Bill). A 0.00001 ETH transfer is included to put this proposal onchain**\n\n\nBali introduces the following changes:\n1. **Token Reserve**: Reserve n tokens for claiming when a DAO is created. Used for DAOs that want to offer reserved token claims via minters.\n2. **Merkle Reserve Minter**: Allow reserved token claiming via merkle proofs. Used for DAOs that want to include a preset list of members to claim tokens.\n3. **L2 Migration Deployer**: Helper contract that lets L1 DAOs deploy and seed a DAO on L2.\n4. **Alternate Metadata Renderers**: Allow current DAOs to set a new metadata renderer. Allow new deployments to choose an alternate renderer.\n5. **Protocol Rewards**: Rewards taken as a percent of protocol auctions distributed to bid referrals, DAO founders and BuilderDAO\n\nFor more information: [view the full Bali spec](https://hackmd.io/peXISQ2CSQOwRGmvpUpK9A)\n\n## Audit\n\nThe DAO funded one audit of this version with Sherlock.\n\nSherlock found:\n- 2 high risk issues\n- 2 medium risk issues\n\nAll issues were fixed in the mitigations review. For more info: [view the full sherlock audit report](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/111/report)\n\n## L2 Deployment Configuration\nThe contracts will be deployed with the following values set:\n\n**Protocol Rewards**\n- Builder Reward: 2.5% of final auction value\n- Referral Reward: 2.5% of final auction value\n- Builder Recipent: OPs working group multisig\n\n**Merkle Minter**\n- Builder Reward: \n    - 0.000777 ETH for every paid mint (Collection+ treasury seed fee)\n    - 0 ETH for free mints (L1 -> L2 Migration)\n- Builder Recipent: OPs working group multisig\n\n## Staged rollout\nSince these changes are additive we have decided to deploy the upgrade in two stages. \n\n**Stage one deployments**:\n- Optimism mainnet\n- Base mainnet\n- Zora mainnet\n\n**Stage two deployment**:\n- Ethereum mainnet\n\nUpon passing of this proposal we will execute the stage one deployments. The nouns builder UI will be updated to temporarily support both versions at the same time. After a period of 1 - 2 weeks of monitoring the stage one deployments we will submit a proposal for the stage two (Ethereum mainnet) deployment.\n\nWhy do a staged deployment?\n1. minimize costs for the DAO. deploying multiple times on L1 could lead to large deployment costs\n2. speed of issue handling flexibility. since the L2 deployments are managed by the tech pod multisig it allows us to quickly fix any issues that may come up during the monitoring period\n3. reduce risks for L1 DAOs with high treasury holdings\n\n## Will this delay L2 migration for L1 DAOs?\n\nNo, migration is only dependent on Bali being deployed to L2 therefore it can be shipped after we are confident there are no issues on L2 and before the upgrades are deployed on L1.",

      "title": "Creating a Guidance Rubric for Builder DAO ",
      "content": "### Summary\nWhen discussing how to define BuilderDAO’s mission, vision and values (MVV), many envision it as the platform of choice, a public good, the future for communities built onchain.\n\n**One of the most important tools to build is one that helps us efficiently and effectively weigh the alignment of any decision with our values**–this permeates many, many things we do: proposal evaluation, feature prioritization, choosing marketing language, incentivizing/recognizing members, and more.\n\nThink of a grocery store’s produce department. There’s a lot of produce to choose from, but our handbasket has limited capacity and our budget has limited funds. We’re constantly weighing the value of sprouts to apples to celery to peppers to bananas (ie, funding a contest vs. a new feature vs. seeding a community vs. a residency, etc), basically, each day comparing apples to oranges.\n\nThere is one thing in the produce section that can help us: the weight scale. Let’s build a scale that measures alignment for any decision we need to make.\n\nWe are requesting 3 ETH to identify key stakeholders, lead group discussions, analyze and wireframe a guidance tool that can be incorporated into the DAO tools (ie, this could be, but is not necessarily similar to the rubric Zamees has been building in public).\n\n### The Existing Challenge\nWe are currently facilitating a negative cash flow that is 24x what we bring in via auctions each month. Yes, we are working toward revenue generation ideas and are hopeful for grant funding, but we're still spending in a way that is not effectively contributing to our sustainability--we MUST prioritize a business model from our core values that focuses on our survival.\n\n### The Solution: Builder DAO Guidance Rubric\nA guidance rubric can “guide” us through indecision, help us feel more comfortable and confident in casting our votes (particularly if against the current), increase participation, prioritize work (like revenue generation), identify our shared vocabulary, reinforce and remind us of our culture, provide a litmus test for evolving values, even serve as a social marketing tool as members publish their decision rubrics.\n\nBuilding artifacts are important assets for reinforcing our connection to the DAO’s purpose. With integrated shared values, we can implement traditions, rewards, celebrations, shared vocabulary, market decisions and more. A guidance artifact can permeate all aspects of the community–from the way we talk to what we build to what we fund, and more.\n\nAs an example, we currently see a lot of variation in the format of funding proposals; authors can easily bypass values that are more difficult to address in a proposal. Solidifying a guidance rubric would allow us to not only evaluate proposals, but also align the proposal creation process with the evaluation process, making it easier for authors and voters alike.\n\n**In this proposal, CULTURECREW seeks funding to:**\n- Work from our current consensus of community mission, vision, values\n- Define wants/needs of members wrt group efforts, project selection, etc based on team member interviews and input (research)\n- Refine (wireframe) a guidance tool to repeatedly assess decisions/opportunities (eg, funding proposals, feature prioritization, marketing opps, etc) to measure their alignment with key criteria\n\n**Future vision:**\n- Work with a developer to investigate creation of tool/s that automatically generate opportunity scores per proposal\n- Explore how to and seamlessly integrate tool(s) into platform\n- Evaluate how to convert this guidance tool to an online solution\n- Rewrite the Proposal Guidelines document (evaluate making it an online step-by-step process)\n- Make it easy to share results to social channels (eg, X and Farcaster)\n- Identify next steps/tools for:\n- Updating the proposal guidelines and creating a tool for submission in alignment with our values\n- Embedding culture in our language and processes\n- Encouraging (and structuring) recognition / incentives / rewards to reinforce culture\n- Adding our cultural values to our “about” and other places that define us\n- Crafting marketing language and UX standards\n- Prioritizing features and other builds\n- Etc.\n\n### Improving Zamees’ Rubric\nMany of you have seen the work that Zamees has been doing with his initial version of a guidance rubric. Although many positive comments have been received, as well as comments that we need such a tool, this initial version has its limitations.\n\nIt is our opinion that this tool feels “good” because we currently don’t have an evaluation tool at all–this tool could truly be more representative of the community and its values.\n\nFor example, it currently defines our core values using an either/or, yes/no, binary approach (either this prop does or doesn’t align with this core value), then suggests that a non-binary scale of 1-5 be used for that evaluation. It would be better served to more specifically define those levels for each core value, as seen in the working document image below:\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifh5juj43gxmdmffckcacpyjqxql4vpzn6u4ujbohjjrg3v2p4v64)\n\nAdditionally, Z’s work assumes that all core values are weighted equally by the community, when that may not necessarily be the case. To be an effective tool, more work should be done on the weight of our values relative to each other.\n\nFinally, the core values listed in Z’s tool are solely his perspective. In other words, they are what he values as important for community health and growth. We have more than 100 other community members–it would be a more representative tool to find shared values from their diverse perspectives.\n\n### Definition of Proposal Success & Principles\nThe goal of this experience is to identify the characteristics of the final solution that guide development decisions.\n\n**A BuilderDAO guidance rubric will:**\n- Become a trusted tool for DAO members\n- Be easy to use/administer\n- Reduce time spent deciding on projects\n- Reduce expense of deciding on projects\n- Continue to show Builder DAO as an industry leader in community tooling\n\n**A successful result  will include the following:**\n- Members interviewed/surveyed about the proposal process report high ease of use\n- Members have higher confidence in the proposal process because it takes less time, there’s more trust and more consensus on what’s worthy of funding (less of a time-consuming popularity contest, more of a criterion-based, inclusive process for all)\n- Increased engagement prior to proposals being put on chain using the shared vocabulary of our values\n- ~5% increase in voting participation by making it easier and safer to validate your reasons publicly\n- 30-50% of voters using the evaluation tool and publishing their results socially\n- Members who use the tool with more frequency also more openly discuss the proposed changes they seek; eventually having social transparency with all decisions being discussed and made in the DAO \n\nWe understand that businesses, movements, communities, products/services all evolve, and that the MVV will also evolve over time–which is why we feel it is  important to commit time and effort to a foundational version of a guidance rubric now, from which we can build with more efficiency and effectiveness and alignment with our current values.\n\nWhile bringing consultants into projects doesn’t guarantee return on investment, this project considers the following principles (and anti-principles) that will be leveraged to achieve our shared goals.\n\n**We believe Builder DAO outputs should be:**\n+ Tangible, tactical\n+ Fast, efficient, time-saving\n+ Logical, straight-forward\n+ Relevant, useful\n+ Purposeful, intentional\n+ Made for us, contextual, specific to our people & organization  \n\n**We intend to facilitate a project and outputs that will not be:**\n+ Murky, opaque\n+ Slow, gatekeeping, bureaucratic\n+ Emotional\n+ Useless, touchy-feely, incorrect\n+ Inadvertent, tangential\n+ Irrelevant\n\n### Budget & Timeline\nThe budget for this project is 3 ETH, to be distributed as follows:\n2.75 ETH to Robin & Leslie (research, analysis, wireframing)\n0.25 ETH to Bob (project management, writing, marketing)\n\nThis project will take approximately 6-8 weeks.\n\n**There are two key components to the work:**\n\nResearch (6-8 weeks)\n- Review Z’s tool in comparison to the MVV\n- Critique Z’s tool to help identify strengths and weaknesses\n- Create a new guidance template from analysis and research\n- Review existing artifacts (and any artifacts in progress)\n- Interview key stakeholders\n- Document findings and review for intercoder reliability\n- Share insights, process for collaboration and permission\n- Introduce the concept and test more broadly\n- Document findings, facilitate discussion, seek approval\n\nImplementation (future proposal)\n- Discoveries in the research phase we will determine how long it will take to implement a guidance tool\n- We will follow up with another prop once we’ve wireframed the tool\n\n### Proposal (The Ask), Treasury Impact & Taxation\nWe are requesting 3 ETH to identify key stakeholders, lead group discussions, analyze and wireframe a guidance tool that can be incorporated into the DAO tooling.\n\nAt the time this proposal was put onchain, it would assign 1.05% of the current treasury to build a vital guidance artifact and tool that can be applied to all decisions the DAO faces.\n\nFor taxation purposes, W9s will be provided upon request.\n\n### About the Authors\n**Leslie Scott**\nLeslie Scott is a seasoned research leader and strategy professional that likes to “help smart people build things that matter.” With a career spanning Google, Microsoft and Wayfair, she has a track record of initiating and managing impactful research programs, identifying cost-saving opportunities and advocating for user-centered design principles.

      "title": "Farconnect at Devconnect Sponsorship",
      "content": "Note from submitter (billzh.eth): I’m submitting this proposal on behalf of Emre who is a Purple member and the organizer of FarConnect.\n\n----\n\n### Farconnect at Devconnect Sponsorship\n\nTLDR\nFarconnect is an offchain social gathering connecting devs, casters and anyone outside of Farcaster to meet and form new relationships irl.\n\nDescription\nDevconnect is a week-long gathering of independent Ethereum events. The time and location are signaled by the Ethereum Foundation and communities independently organize events throughout the week(s). The event is held at Kolektif House Levent from 7pm-12am (GMT+3).\n\nFarconnect @ Devconnect is a social gathering to connect with devs and casters offchain. Farconnect welcomes everyone to join and vibe. Farconnect, inspired by FarCon (which was sponsored by BuilderDAO for 4 ETH in Prop 51) , is an unconference, where BuilderDAO member billzh.eth will be giving a talk about the interplay between DAOs and web3 social, with BuilderDAO as a prominent example.\n\nBudget\nWe’re proposing BuilderDAO cover 0.8 ETH of a total 5.2 ETH budget for this event. The remaining 4.4 ETH are being co-sponsored by Purple (2 ETH) and other sponsors listed on https://farconnect.xyz/.\n\nWe’ve calculated the costs as follows:\n$2785.00 (79.200 TL) to reserve the venue for 150 people including the renting of the sound and visual systems (incl. mandatory technician)\n$3240.00 (90.000 TL) for unlimited (alcoholic) beverages.\n$4922.00 (140.400 TL) for finger food.\n\nTotal:\n$10.851 including 20% VAT\n≈ $72 per headcount (value might fluctuate depending on TL/USD rate)\n\nNorthstar Check\nBuilder DAO is dedicated to the creation and development of free and accessible DAO infrastructure as a public good.\n\nSponsoring a conference for Farcaster - also building as a public good - allows us an opportunity to get in front of some of the best builders in web3. Nouns is one of the most used channels on Farcaster and BuilderDAO plays a crucial role in enabling new DAO formations. The synergies of Farcaster and the Nounish DAO creation from BuilderDAO have been positive sum and this event will help spread awareness of BuilderDAO.\n\nFarconnect is also a potential source of revenue generation for BuilderDAO. Putting BuilderDAO in front of the right audience would help drive up auction demand, as we have seen after our sponsorship of FarCon\n\nTreasury Impact\nThe funding request of 0.8 eth will have minimal impact on the treasury. There is no admin budget for this event and all funds will be used towards event expenses.\n\nMultisig\nA ⅔ multisig has been created for this proposal at mainnet address: 0x506bD2a7993fc6e6a5C68e0A4B6AdFfA4539d003\n\nmatthew and antimofm.eth from Farcaster have agreed to approve/deny reimbursements.",

      "content": "# Builder DAO+Nouns Builder Protocol Onchain Data update by sealaunch\n\n\n## TL;DR\n\nThis proposal is a follow-up to [proposal 34](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/34). Under this proposal, sealaunch will update the Nouns Builder Dune Dashboards to Dune Engine V2 and expand its integration to other L2 rollups where Nouns Builder has been launched, including Base, OP, and Zora Network.\n\n*Note: I'm sponsoring this proposal on behalf of mfrs but am not directly involved in this project*\n\n## Description\nSince the last proposal, Dune launched Dune Engine V2 ([read more about it](https://dune.com/blog/dune-engine-v2)). \nFor this reason, most of the queries and dashboards created under the last proposal were broken due to using deprecated data sets (all queries need to be migrated or refactored to the new Dune Engine). Also, since then, Nouns Builder launched in other L2 rollups (Base, OP, Zora). \n\nUnder this proposal, sealaunch will create a Dune Dashboard for BuilderDAO and another for Nouns Builder Protocol, using Dune Engine V2 and including all L2 rollups where the protocol launched. For proposal 34, the following dashboards were created but will need to be updated as described:\n-  [Builder DAO Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/sealaunch/builderdao)\n-  [Nouns Builder Protocol Dune Dashboard](https://dune.com/sealaunch/nouns-builder-protocol)\n\nIn this context, the following key deliverables will be updated/created:\n\n\n* **Dashboard for BuilderDAO** \n    * All previous queries that were created for this Dashboard will be refactored to Dune Engine V2. Additional charts and analyses that improve the overall quality of the dashboard will be included.\n    * Scope of the Dune Dashboard: Dashboard with the major performance metrics of the DAO covering the auctions, governance, treasury, holders, etc… \n* **Dashboard of the Nouns Builder Protocol (including L2 rollups)**\n    * All previous queries that were created for this Dashboard will be refactored to Dune Engine V2. The dashboard will also include all data regarding Nouns Builder Protocol in L2 Rollups (Base, OP, Zora), aggregated and separately.\n    * Scope of the Dune Dashboard: Dashboard with an overview of the Nouns Builder Protocol usage (number of DAOs, number of unique users, number of bids, treasury sizes, L2 etc). \n\n\n\nAll of the Dune queries and dashboards will be public and open-source, and their code can be forked and used by the community/subDAOs as needed.\n\nThe dashboards will be completed in 4 weeks.\n\n\n## Funding\n3 ETH (approximately 1% of the current Treasury)\n\n\n## About sealaunch/mfrs\n[mfrs](https://twitter.com/mfrs_manuel) is an early member and contributor of Lil Nouns.

All proceeds from TYC grants and auction sales will go to **fund and empower nounish artists and content creators via art contests, creative Prop House rounds and content commissions.**\n\n\n[![BJthO5e.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/g0z2cMYz/BJthO5e.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/k2Hmfv6z)\n*Examples of some amazing nounish art that has been funded by our past contests.*\n\n\n\n---\n\n# **Yellow: A Collective by the Community, For the Community**\n\nWhen launched, all of the nounish heads for this collection will have been created by community artists and voted on by Nouncil in a Prop House round. Over 400 entries were received from artists all over the world, and the [Top 50 shown here](https://prop.house/the-yellow-collective/the-yellow-collective-trait-contest-1:-best-noun-heads) will be included as the first cohort of heads for Collective Nouns.\n\n[![yellow-collective.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/Vv3xSNn9/yellow-collective.gif)](https://postimg.cc/QKJ4wh6V)\n\nFor some additional Noundry-style fun, The Yellow Collective will also host a YELLOW RUMBLE every quarter and let the community vote for the best noun head added to the collection during that period, and we will then sponsor a proposal to have it graduated and potentially added to the main Nouns DAO protocol descriptor! \n\n\n\n---\n\n# **What is Our Mission?**\nPart of our mandate at The Noun Square has always been to act as an educational resource for our community, and we have spent a lot of time and effort this year teaching about the benefits of using Ethereum L2s. For example, we migrated our [NOMO Nouns](https://nomo.wtf) Daily Open Edition collection to Optimism this summer, and have been offering Onchain versions of our weekly video podcast Zero Rights Reserved as [free mints on the Zora L2](https://zora.co/collect/zora:0x20035fea4dd659553233fe5ea3ca207e6427b5eb). \n\nLaunching **Collective Nouns** on BASE is the final \"Infinite Stone\" in our multiprong approach to bring the Nouniverse firmly onto the Superchain. \n\n[![op-stack-infinity-stones-meme-builder.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/JhJwL5qF/op-stack-infinity-stones-meme-builder.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/f3wq7X17)\n\nWe have been planning to launch an onchain club for our community for a long time, and are very grateful to the Nouns Builder team for shipping L2 compatibility for the tool so that we can finally bring that vision to life.  \n\nThis grant will help us to build momentum behind The Yellow Collective and drive interest in our upcoming contests and content funding rounds over the next 3 months, so that we can attract existing creators in our ecosystem (and new ones from outside) to come, collaborate and create together onchain!\n\n\n# How Will The Funds Be Used?\n\nAll funds will be used by the Collective to fund a minimum of 4 nounish art contests promoted and administered by The Noun Square over the next 3 months. These will all be Nouns-themed competitions and at least one of the contests will be explicitly about the Nouns Builder tool to bring more specific awareness to artists and builders in our network. \n\nHaving some initial funds in the treasury to begin will help us to drive more interest in the daily auction, as these tokens will be used to vote on future art contests, as well as the contests to add additional traits to the collection every 3 months. \n\nOver time, we hope to keep this momentum and flywheel spinning so that future contests and nounish media commissions can be funded solely by daily auction proceeds.\n\nImportant note on how the treasury will be managed in the early days of TYC: We are deliberately structuring this org as a Collective / Club and not necessarily as a DAO. While we do broadly believe in the ethos of DAOs and specifically decentralization, we believe that in order to be successful, onchain groups need strong leadership in early days, coupled with progressive decentralization later on. \n\nTo this end, the Yellow Collective treasury will be managed by a trusted multisig made up of 4 core TNS founders (Toady Hawk, Benbodhi, Robotfishgirl, Joshua Fisher) to begin. TYC token holders will have input into the cadence, themes and prizes for the art rounds, and will be able to vote on winners, but the multisig will ensure that there is no incentive in early days for anyone to buy tokens with the express intent of extracting, and simultaneously guide momentum in the direction of the Collective's founding vision: to fund and empower the next generation of Nounish artists and creatives. \n\n\n# How Does This Benefit Builder DAO?\n\nThe Builder DAO tool is undeniably a public good, and its value to the commons is only magnified by the number of successful DAOs and Collectives that are bootstrapped by the tooling and grants you provide. \n\nProf Werder often speaks about the importance of \"Minimum Viable Community\" in founding DAOs, and in our case we believe that we have a Maximum Viable Community, with 20,000+ followers across our social and daily earnest engagement on all our educational content and art contests, which we have been producing consistently for 16 months. \n\nFor this reason, we believe a grant investment in the early success of The Yellow Collective is one that will definitely pay goodwill dividends to the protocol in the medium term, as many future DAOists will have a great example of another successful, vibrant Collective launched on, and leveraging Nouns.build. \n\nIn addition to these soft benefits of collaboration, we will also commit to giving Builder DAO pride of placement as contest sponsor in all our announcements on Twitter/X, TikTok and elsewhere over the next 3 months. This is the kind of messaging that very routinely will get 20,000+ impressions for us, see an example below:\n\n[![contest-tweet-example.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/qvkK3pgB/contest-tweet-example.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/rKPz6XS7)\n\nWe will also be continuing to produce educational content for our community about our L2 journey, and will be sure to include Builder DAO as part of that story in upcoming videos, threads, etc. And as mentioned above, will make the Nouns Builder tool the explicit theme for at least one of our upcoming arts contests as well. \n\nIt is important to mention that we do intend to launch The Yellow Collective regardless of the results of this grant application, but will just need to proceed with contests and activity at a much slower pace in that case. However, this grant, if approved, it would really allow us to hit the ground running and leverage our substantial network and community momentum to grow faster and make a more substantial and sustained impact over the next 3 months. \n\nWe are a proven Nounish team with a vibrant and active community, seeking your help to make our Builder DAO launch as successful as it can possibly be. Thank you very much for your consideration!\n\n\n*NB: After receiving feedback from BDAO members, we have revised our original proposal to reflect a smaller scope with the goal of helping TYC gain traction over the first 3 months after launch (vs 6 months) without causing undue burden to the BDAO treasury.* ",

      "title": "Founder Support Resident",
      "content": "![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkIOJ9jL2.jpg)\n\n## tl:dr: 9 ETH for 3 months to actively support DAO Founders using nouns.build\n\nThis is a proposal to create a Founder Support Resident to facilitate communications, connections and the sharing of knowledge between DAO Founders and those considering it to unlock the power of DAOs and onchain collectives using Nouns.build for a diverse set of use cases. It requests 9 ETH for 3 months (Nov/Dec/January) for [Chris Carella](https://warpcast.com/ccarella.eth) to administer the program.\n\n**The real tldr;** it's hard and at times absolutely sucks to be the Founder of a DAO and there is almost no one to talk about it with.\n\n### Description\n\nDAOs and onchain collectives created with nouns.build are the lifeblood of the Nouns Builder protocol. When they are well run, they can achieve a self-sustaining virtuous flywheel of projects that make people want to join the organization, thus contributing back to the Treasury which can be used to fund more exciting projects. Additionally, when well run, they inspire other social entrepreneurs to create new DAOs built with Nouns.build.\n\nTo date, BuilderDAO has provided limited support to those Founders and those thinking about becoming Founders of DAO's or onchain collectives. However, being a Founder of a Nounish DAO is a challenging position, with no manuals or playbooks. It’s just as challenging as being a startup founder but without a rich history of tactics to lean on.\n\nIt’s a challenge; I have first hand experience. The good news is we have had many social entrepreneurs start DAOs using nouns.build, experience challenges, learn lessons and find repeatable strategies that work for them. The bad news is that we’ve had no forum to connect with each other and exchange those learnings. While some of these learnings should be shared publicly, like discovering additional revenue sources, others require private discretion, like how it feels when your leadership is being questioned in mean and trolling language.\n\n### The Program\n\nThe Program is a mix of public and private engagements, one on one engagements and group discussion. Acknowledging that our DAOs are Global I will aim to make myself available across timezones. Early mornings and late nights are fair game to make sure everyone is heard and knowledge is transferred. It can be even more difficult to be a Founder from Australia when a vast majority of Builder DAO operates on U.S. hours.\n\nMy goal is to work 7-8 hours a week. Any unused office hours will be used to write or record videos about issues facing leadership at DAOs and onchain collectives.\n\nOffice Hours: Two 30 minute slots will be available each day for private and small group chats. I will make morning, mid-day and nights available. In addition to Office Hours:\n\nMonday: \n\n**Public Aburra Sessions with Founders and Prospects**\n\nThe goal is to engage with a public audience about the benefits and challenges of starting a DAO with nouns.build. I want to encourage people to start their own Builder DAOs. I will workshop and engage with Prospects and inspire people to consider nouns.build by highlighting other founders and DAOs.\n\nTuesday: \n\n**Private Zoom Sessions with Founders** \n\nMost of the issues facing founders, that can make them feel isolated or confused must be discussed in private. Private Zoom Group Sessions (along with office hours) give the Founders a place to discuss issues that are sensitive or that they might feel embarrassed about talking about in Public.\n\nWednesday: \n\n**Discord Audio Chat  & Hangout with Builder DAO Members** \n\nThe goal of this weekly chat is to bring the lessons and stories learned through this process to the BuilderDAO Membership. What are some processes working for DAOs? What are some challenges? What is blocking people from starting their own DAOs?\n\nFriday: \n\n**External Media**\n\nI will try to represent the Founder experience for Builder DAOs on podcasts and twitter spaces. Any unbooked weeks I will stream on Unlonely and talk about the Founder experience with a wider, more diverse audience.\n\n### What Does Success Look Like\n\nA successful program will result in the following:\n\n- Founders of DAO's and onchain collectives feeling more confident with the tools available to them and less isolated. (Qualitative)\n\n- New DAOs being created whose first contact was the Founder Support Resident. (Quantitative)\n\n- Successful communication back to BuilderDAO about the top issues facing Founders and blockers stopping people from creating new DAOs. (Qualitative)\n\n- Artifacts such as recordings, blog posts and videos that can be evergreen resources directed at those who have created or are considering creating a DAO. (Quantitative)\n\n- Founders engaging with BuilderDO evangelism, drawing new people to BuilderDAO and Nouns Builder. \n\n\n### Budget and Timeline\n\n9 ETH over 3 months to administer the program streamed via Sablier.\n\n### Multi-sig\n\n9 ETH would be sent to a multisig as outlined below. They would set up a Sablier stream and ccarella.eth would receive 3 ETH per month for 3 months at the beginning of each month. \n\n\nThe Safe to handle ccarella.eth's transaction:\n\n- eth:0xBA7a9d3Ad841B9CfC679DcD3fa152Cd46daba29a\n\nSigners:\n\n- zaak.eth: 0x77ac30452890E5210CB334f601a0A6E8F0A5201B\n\n- thenounishprof.eth: 0xCEEd9585854F12F81A0103861b83b995A64AD915\n\n- ccarella.eth: 0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F\n\nRecipient:\n\n- ccarella.eth: 0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F\n\n### Why Chris?\n\nI’m the co-founder of Purple, our oldest and one of our most liveliest DAOs. I have overseen our initial success, navigated us through a number of social engineering challenges and encouraged members to take ownership and feel empowered. \n\nI’m a member & contributor to:\n\n- [Purple](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xa45662638e9f3bbb7a6fecb4b17853b7ba0f3a60/362?tab=activity) (co-founder, our first DAO)\n\n- [ENERGY](https://nouns.build/dao/zora/0x32297b7416294b1acf404b6148a3c58107ba8afd/51) (a founding stewards, our first L2 onchain collective )\n\n- [Builder DAO](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/357)\n\n- [The Park](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0x96e396e66087b2b9dcad36fd473e1b049df18998/316)\n\n- [Based Management](https://nouns.build/dao/base/0xb78b89eb81303a11cc597b4519035079453d8e31/21)\n\nI’m a member and support of:\n\n- [The Homies DAO](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0x785c9e48b8ff3f75d970932b89a16fba723a1195/32)\n\n- [BLVKHVND](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0x351ea1a718521f22718ae14f7d380ae345fad043/190)\n\n- [Art Haus](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0x65e0fed751abca42bc82006f84e31f5cd95d6d66/63)\n\n- [Based Mingos](https://nouns.build/dao/base/0x2746eafaac12679b4a0e172daf557e741e58b151/78)\n\n\nAdditionally I’m a member of the [Optimism Citizen’s House](https://vote.optimism.io/?tab=citizens), a [Delegate at Nouns](https://www.nounsagora.com/delegate/ccarella.eth) and Head of Product at [CharmVerse](https://www.charmverse.io/), a DAO operations platform, where I collaborate with dozens of DAOs and their leaders on a monthly basis.\n\nI have experienced the isolation of challenging DAO events with no resources to talk to and navigated Purple through many difficult issues including a co-founder leaving and a fork, yet we have continued the virtuous flywheel and maintained strong auction performance. We’re also one of the most decentralized DAO, with a top Gini coefficent amongst mature Builder DAOs and we've encouraged many leaders to step up, take ownership and themselves think like a Founder.\n\nFinally, I have been doing this work on a informal basis, since our second onchain collective, The Park, contacted me to discuss lessons learned before they launched. I’m generous with my time and have helped discuss and onboard prospects such as Refraction and Based Management.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkVFW9sU2.jpg)\n\n### Northstar Check\n\nBuilder DAO is dedicated to the creation and development of free and accessible DAO infrastructure as a public good.\n\nThis proposal furthers that mission by de-risking and increasing the chances of success for DAOs and onchain collectives using nouns.build by supporting the Social Entrepreneurs who took the risk of deploying a DAO.\n\nUltimately, our successful DAOs will always be our most successful marketing and means of proliferation and by sharing the lessons and tactics learned by the Founders of DAOs using Nouns.build, we will increase our number of successful organizations.\n\n### Treasury Impact\n\nRequesting 9 ETH streamed over 3 months which is approximately 2.9% of the current Treasury (300.026 ETH).\n\n## Team\n\n[Chris Carella (ccarella.eth)](https://warpcast.com/ccarella.eth) is leading this effort and will be responsible for tax filings. Chris is the first Founder of a Nouns Builder DAO, through his deployment of the Purple contracts on October 25, 2022.\n\n## Transactions\n\nSend 9 ETH to the Safe that is responsible for setting up and administering the Sablier payments.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryudQqi83.jpg)\n",

      "content": "## tl:dr: Sponsor Bagels and Builders for 1 eth at a nounish DAO meetup at Art Basel Miami, December 7 as part of a larger all day event focusing on building in the Nouns ecosystem.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkIOJ9jL2.jpg)\n\nDuring Art Basel week in Miami, Lil Nouns will be hosting an all day meetup on Thursday, December 7 at Hodler Gallery in the Wynwood art district in Miami. \n\nBuilderDAO has an opportunity to be the primary sponsor of Bagels and Builders morning meetup as well as being a part of the events for the full day, including on all social media and promotion, as well as a dedicated gallery screen to showcase BuilderDAO, Nouns Builder and DAOs built on Nouns Builder. There are only 4 spots available for sponsorship with dedicated screen.\n\n**Tentative Event Plan:**\n\n10 am to Noon: Bagels & Builders meetup for BuilderDAO, PurpleDAO, Lil Nouns and other nounish DAOs, as well as Farcaster builders.\n\n12:30 pm: \"Building with Nouns\" Lunch & Learn about building with Lil Nouns, Nouns and Nounish DAOs including BuilderDAO and Nouns Builder (tentatively with a live prop house)\n\n3 pm: possible other panel -- in discussion \n\n6 - 9 pm: PizzaDAO happy hour\n\nThe space will be open as a co-working/meet-up space throughout the day, with streams and spaces of the panels and interviews with guests. The gallery screens will rotate BuilderDAO/Nouns Builder art and information througout the day.\n\n\nSee the Lil Nouns prop here: https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/143 \n\nBuilderDAO and Nouns Builder will be the primary sponsor of Bagels and Builders morning event plus overall sponsorship of the whole event, including curation of one of the eight gallery screens to feature BuilderDAO and Nounish DAO art and info throughout the day. \n\nWe also plan to stream the panel events to allow for virtual attendance for communities who sponsor the event and for sharing the recording after the event for continued promotion.\n\nIn addition, BuilderDAO will be featured on all marketing and content over the next two months leading up to the event and photo/video content from this event will be shared. This should get great attention from our target audience.\n\nHere's a thread with photos from the NYC Bagels & Builders event for reference: \n**https://x.com/ProfWerder/status/1647547986216353792?s=20**\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkVFW9sU2.jpg)\n\n# **Northstar Check**\n\n### **Powering Onchain Communities. The BuilderDAO mission is to develop DAO infrastructure as a public good, enabling decentralized, inclusive, and transparent decision-making processes that empower onchain communities to shape their collective futures.**\n\nThis proposal furthers that mission by exposing new builders to Nouns Builder and providing an opportunity to feature BuilderDAO and DAOs built on Nouns Builder to a DAO/NFT centric audience. This event also gives existing members of nounish DAOs and opportunity to connect IRL.\n\n\n## **Treasury Impact**\n\nThe impact on treasury is minimal at a 1 eth ask and is expected to provide an outsized return. \n\n\n## **Team**\n\nThe event planning team from Lil Nouns includes two BuilderDAO members (Lil Mike Good and Prof Werder) plus 3 other trusted builders in the ecosystem (Index, Cardno and Snax from PizzaDAO). There is no admin budget for this event and all funds will be used towards event expenses.\n\n## **Transactions**\n\n1 eth to the event multisig at: \n0x0178c56c5fB41C8Ea44DB5942Ae70f93E3754bf2\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryudQqi83.jpg)\n\n\n",

      "title": "Builder DAO Communications Extension",
      "content": "## tl;dr\n\nI'm seeking to continue the [Builder Buzz newsletter](http://paragraph.xyz/@builder) and expand the [proposal tracking work](https://www.notion.so/a66f8a89dce64ed680a9c16eb2dec364?pvs=21) which I was originally funded through [Prop 57](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/57). \n\n---\n\n## Newsletter\n\nThe [newsletter](http://paragraph.xyz/@builder) has become an essential hub of news and updates for the Builder DAO and Nouns Builder community. In this fast-paced digital realm with many unique feeds of information, Builder Buzz has become an anchor for the community, consistently delivering the latest developments, events, and news. It’s not just about relaying DAO activites, but also shining a spotlight on all community milestones and projects. By curating content, the newsletter ensures our community isn't missing information, and instead gets concise, relevant updates. Plus, as Builder Buzz continues to gain momentum, it's not just enhancing our visibility but also attracting fresh collaborators. With active pushes on platforms like Farcaster and Twitter, we’re ensuring the buzz reaches far and wide.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJlwlOdxp.png)\n\n### Content Amplification\n\nIn addition to publishing the newsletter, I will start repurposing the content contained within the newsletter to be published as individual tweets/posts in the days following the publication of the newsletter. Each section will be turned into a unique post. Certain posts will be repeating every week or so, including reminders of meetings, protocol stats, etc. Others will be unique based on the news and events happening that week. Below is a table calculating how many of each type of post can be derived from previous publications of the newsletter. Some of these posts have already been being published, such as public work sessions, so there is some overlap but based on previous publications it is safe to assume we can derive at least 8 posts from each newsletter moving forward.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1L9GLclp.png )\n\n### Opportunities for Collaboration\n\nI will also begin exploring options for collaborating with authors of other newsletters. Opportunities for co-promos, content swaps, or sponsorships of some form may be a viable pathway for gaining more views on the newsletter, and in turn attracting more people to check out what we are up to. There is no compensation for this work included in this proposal as I will wait until I am able to work something out then come back with additional proposals for these opportunities as needed. If you have ideas or opportunities that you think may be of interest, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\n---\n\n## Proposal Tracking\n\nThe [current setup for the proposal tracking in Notion](https://www.notion.so/a66f8a89dce64ed680a9c16eb2dec364?pvs=21) records essential details from each proposal, such as the ask, vote outcomes, associated teams, and more. I'd like to continue maintaining this database with this data and links to discussions.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1soVvcep.png)\n\n---\n\n## Budget\n\n- Newsletters and associated posts: 12 @ 0.333 ETH each = 4.0 ETH\n- Proposal tracking: 0.20 ETH/month = 0.6 ETH\n- Total: 4.6 ETH \n\n*Note: 1 post will be published on 10/9 prior to the conclusion of voting on this proposal, if the vote passes it will effectively be retroactive compensation for the first post of this period.*\n\n---\n\n## North Star Check\n\nThis proposal aligns with and furthers the [Mission, Vision, and Values](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/66) of Builder DAO via transparent communication and clearly presented historical proposal data.\n\n\n### Treasury Impact\n\nRequesting 4.6 ETH (approximately 1.5% of the Builder DAO treasury at the time of writing)\n\n### Timeline\n\n3 months",

      "content": "# TL:DR\n\nA proposal to create a coordinated promotional video series, designed to reach and inspire the next cohort of DAO Founders to join the Nouns Builder ecosystem, launching on Builder DAO’s first anniversary.\n\nThe proposal will deliver:\n\n- A fast-moving promo video, that compresses a year of building into one minute, to be released on Builder DAO’s one year anniversary.\n- A five minute short documentary film, revealing the mission, successes and long-term vision of the DAO.\n- 7 DAO profile films. 60-90 second videos profiling selected DAOs launched on Builder and what they have built and released.\n\nTogether the films will create an integrated series, aimed at different categories of audiences, to be distributed across onchain, offchain and IRL, wherever they are needed.\n\n# CONTEXT\n\nNouns revolutionised the concept of what a DAO can be.\n\nZora revolutionised onchain media.\n\nBuilder inhabits the space between them.\n\nRevolutionising the infrastructure of coordination.\n\nThis a big deal. < ---\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Qv6jYcC/Builder-in-teh-middle.png)\n\nHowever…\n\nOutside of the world of the Zorbish/Nounish/Farcaster community, there is little understanding of what Builder actually does, other than ‘build’. \n\nI asked around:\n\n   “It’s part of Nouns isn’t it?”\n\n   “It’s where the Zora devs hang out”\n\nBoth kinda correct but hardly the headline story, we’re hoping for.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to change that perception, by reaching audiences we haven’t reached yet in a new way, sharing our mission, successes and our long-term vision.\n\nTo make clicking the bottom button as natural as clicking the top three.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/mbG2cxs/THIS-ONE.png)\n\n# THE FILMS\n\n## Promo film: A year of building in one minute.\n\nA high-speed journey through all of the highlights of what has been created so far from the DAOs launched on Builder. \n\nThe film begins with the 'Create your DAO button'. Click\n\nWe then fast-forward through a year of building compressed into a minute, a stream of moments and experiences, that brings us to the present day.\n\nWe zoom back and find ourselves on Zora, minting the film we are watching. <Meta>\n\nAnd end the film with a question, a provocation to the audience: \n\n**‘What could you build?’**\n\n## The Short Documentary\n\nA five minute documentary that reveals the story of Builder DAO from the people who built it, constructed in three acts.\n\n- Origins and mission\n- The successes of the last year in more detail and how Builder has enabled this.\n- The long-term vision and the opportunity for founders, builders and communities.\n\nThe narrative will be built from audio interviews by DAO members and Founders. The details of the visual style will emerge once we have gathered all of the relevant content and edited the narrative.\n\nThe goal is for the viewer to feel inspired and also to understand in more detail the opportunity that Nouns Builder offers.\n\n## DAO Profile videos\n\nTo allow the audience to dig deeper, we will also produce 7(?) short 60-90 second profiles of individual DAOs. The narrative comes from founders and members of the DAO with the visual style dependent on the nature of that specific DAO.\n\nThese films will be useful both for Builder and for the individual DAOs and provide useful content for regular release over a period of time.\n\n## Archive\n\nAs part of the production, we will also deliver an online archive of all of the interviews and content we have gathered, that can be accessed by the DAO for use in the future.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe campaign is designed as a funnel to bring people to the DAO.\n\nThe sixty second promo grabs attention, the documentary reveals the mission and vision and the DAO profiles provide the specific background detail.\n\nBy launching the first film on the anniversary of Builder DAO’s genesis we are both celebrating the successes and firmly planting our flag in the ground for the years ahead.\n\n# Branding: Builder Originals\n\nThe films will be released as BUILDER ORIGINALS, with a branded identity based on assets from the Builder Art Pack. \n\nThis places the series within a wider narrative than just being ‘promotional’ pieces. By using the ubiquitous ‘Originals’ banner we are presenting the films as individual stories and part of a sub-brand that can be developed over time. \n\nThis also potentially makes them more collectable and offers more opportunities for promotion (front page of Zora?)\n\n# Distribution: Onchain, offchain, and IRL\n\nThe goal is to release the films onchain, offchain and IRL to reach the widest possible audience.\n\n### Onchain and offchain\n\nAll of the videos will be released on Zora and promoted through Farcaster and offchain social channels. The films can also be linked to any podcast show notes where members of Builder DAO are guests and used for cross-marketing and to engage partners. Essentially wherever we need to engage interest.\n\n### IRL\n\nAn IRL campaign gives us the chance to cast the net wider, to include:\n\n- Major independent film festivals that attract audiences that align with our mission - SXSW, Sheffield Doc Fest, Raindance, Slamdance\n- Smaller festivals that specifically cover subjects of art, culture and technology.\n- Crypto conferences during 2024\n\nIn short, the films are an asset that can be used anywhere we have the opportunity. \n\n# Process\n\nThe process will be transparent and collaborative.\n\n### Shared research.\n\nThe first step will be to gather audio interviews with DAO members. This can be done in participation with other DAO teams who can also benefit from the research process. The interviews will be archived online and made available to DAO members.\n\nWe’ll gather the relevant visual content from all of the participating DAOS that will also be archived.\n\n### Production and Editing\n\nWe suggest appointing an editorial board to feedback on the final edits to make sure the film narratives are aligned. All participants will have full editorial control over their own contributions.\n\n### Timeline\n\nFrom early October until mid-December\n\n- First film to be released 15th November\n- Documentary to be completed by the end of November\n- DAO profile films delivered by mid-December and released according to an agreed schedule TBC.\n\n# Budget\n\nThe total budget for the proposal is 9.5 ETH\n\n- Producer, Director & Editor - deebee.eth: 8 ETH\n- Additional freelancers 1 ETH\n- Expenses: 0.5 ETH\n\ndeebee is a resident of The UK and will be responsible for paying relevant taxes.\n\n# Treasury impact\n\nThis represents 2.85% of the treasury at the time of writing. \n\n# The Team\n\nThe campaign will be produced by @deebee and TheyWhoKnow, a collective of diverse creative souls founded by @deebee.\n\n### deebee\n\nI'm an experienced Filmmaker, Immersive Media Director and Creative Director with a proven history of problem-solving through storytelling for global brands, the arts, cultural orgs and NGOs.\n\nI've designed and produced storytelling campaigns for global super-brands such as Google, Dropbox, Red Bull, Virgin, HP and NGOs including The UN and The EU and my work has been featured in over 50 global film festivals including the Venice Biennale.\n\nCrypto since 2013. Web3 since 2019. DAOs since 2021. Member of the Strategic Advisory Board of Hashes DAO and a contributor to many others. Serial Instigator.\n\n### They Who Know\n\nA collective of experienced Creative Strategists, Storytellers and Editors founded by @deebee, with the express purpose of bringing unchained creative talent onchain.\n\n[https://www.theywhoknow.com](url)\n\n# Northstar Check\n\nThe heart of the proposal is to promote the mission and vision of Builder DAO to a wider audience. The process will be open, transparent and collaborative and involve DAO members to confirm alignment with DAO values at all stages.\n\n# Success\n\nThe most obvious way to measure the success of the campaign is simple - more quality DAOs launching and the price of Builder Tokens rising to signify more members joining from outside of our current ecosystem.\n\nMore specifically recasts, reposts and views generated from the videos being shared at online events (podcasts, twitter spaces etc.) are also a good metric of campaign engagement.\n\nAlso, acceptance to film festivals and presence at major crypto events would be a strong validation.\n\nI don’t personally believe sales of onchain media are particularly illustrative of reach in this case. Although I hope I’m proved wrong.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe DAO's first anniversary is a great moment to celebrate successes and share the Builder story with both the existing ecosystem and a wider audience. But this is not just a vanity-driven ‘look what we did’ piece.\n\nIt could be argued that we currently exist in a space defined by Nouns, Zora and Farcaster. For the protocol to grow we need to spread our story beyond these hallowed walls.\n\nVideo is the best way to engage new audiences and this campaign has the power to allow Builder DAO to reach and inspire a new cohort of founders, builders and communities to the ecosystem.\n",

      "content": "# Community Resident/DAO Educator Prof Werder (3mo. extension)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SO6Kkoy.jpg)\n\n## **This proposal is for continuation of the BuilderDAO Community Resident/DAO Educator (Prof Werder) for October, November, December 2023.**\n\nBuilderDAO has continued on a positive trajectory over the past 3 months, with some significant recognition of our efforts. \n\nHighlights from the past three months include:\n\n* DAO Workshops: held three DAO workshops to correspond with the L2 launch and Base's Onchain Summer initiative. \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJofYN0ya.png)\n\n* Launched Based Mingos during one of those sessions as an experimental DAO on Base and wrote a piece on it here which was featured on the Onchain Summer homepage: https://paragraph.xyz/@nounishprof/basedmingos\nand shared on Twitter here: https://x.com/ProfWerder/status/1694692951106912407?s=20\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1kiFNA16.png)\n\n* I entered BuilderDAO in the Onchain Summer and Build on Base Prop House rounds. Although we did not win, we did have a great showing in both; placed 22 of 147 in Onchain Summer round and 7th of 143 in the Build on Base round. These prop house rounds gave us some great visibility of our effort around L2 even without the wins.\n\n* In addition to the many shares of our posts we got about our prop house entries and DAO workshops, we got a random shout out from Lil Prop House as well: \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SysGyBA1T.jpg)\n\n* Over the past 3 months, I've had opportunities on multiple spaces, interviews and podcasts to share about BuilderDAO and Nouns Builder, including a DAO workshop for Upstream, a DAO platform, with Alex Taub (also founder of Goblintown). \nhttps://x.com/joinupstream/status/1694323362477346846?s=20\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ2IgHCyp.jpg)\n\n* We also have continued to see a positive impact from the Overpriced Jpegs event we sponsored. While discussing the Nouns fork on the podcast last week with Zeneca, Carly gave BuilderDAO and Nouns Builder a great shout-out starting around the 20 minute mark here: https://youtu.be/2UDIhVWiTlg?si=ecmyXjUgv2neStx9&t=1203 \n> **I worked with...Nouns Builder...and my experience going through their DAO process was really impressive. I was like wow this is an incredibly organized group...this is a DAO... that functions.**\n\n* I've been working with a few different groups that will be launching DAOs that I think will provide fun stories and creative use of Nouns Builder. One such initiative is FreeKevin.wtf using [nilli.com](https://base.nilli.com/) to encourage Pixelmon to allow for Kevin to be released as cc0 and then launch a DAO on Nouns Builder to fund proliferation. The auctions will be paused unless conditions are met via Nilli which is an interesting way to judge whether or not there is a Minimum Viable Community for a DAO. This has been a fun project that is in soft launch mode at the moment and I'm looking forward to seeing how it develops, as well as seeking other creative uses of Nouns Builder.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyzIiH0ka.png)\n \n\n**With all we have going on, I'm excited to continue in the Community Resident role. Over the next three months, my focus will include:**\n\n* Launch gamified experiences for DAO exploration/education. The L2 DAO options offer new opportunities to have fun with DAOs as a way to experience our platform and encourage creativity. I have two games that I'll be launching soon.\n* Increase Builder Guild membership with a goal to double active membership by year end.\n* Expand BuilderBox content with live streams on Unlonely and recordings via NFTs on Zora. \n* Design a monthly DAO workshop as an ongoing education tool.\n* Record a minimum of three mini video tutorials (approx 3-5 min each) on using different aspects of Nouns Builder and release as NFT editions on Zora.\n* Continue weekly office hours to provide a consistent space for Q&A as well as prop discussions when needed.\n* Seek out opportunities to showcase Nouns Builder at IRL events (e.g. Art Basel Miami - in talks now) and in media.\n* Continue discord management to provide an easy place to find assistance as well as connect with other BuilderDAO members.\n* Continue to use BuilderDAO Warpcast channel to extend communication around proposals and answer questions for those seeking guidance around BuilderDAO.\n* Continue work with the Ops working group in regards to administrative issues with the \n\n\n*I've been asked by a few people to create a prop for six months but I think the three month increments allow for a check-in for both the DAO and me to ensure continued alignment.*\n\n\n**During the Nouns fork, I was interviewed a few times and had to address the idea that the fork proves \"DAOs don't work; DAOs are dead.\" I've never been more confident in the opposite. We've hit a nice stride and I hope that we can continue this pace to demonstrate the power of onchain communities.**\n\n\n---\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/C0KGnpU.jpg)\n\n\n### North Star Check\n* All activities noted above help either to amplify the activities of BuilderDAO or educate around the Nouns Builder protocol, in alignment with BuilderDAO's mission.\n\n---\n\nFunding request: 9 eth total for the community resident for the three month period of October - December. Small increase due to eth price adjustment and additional activities around DAO workshops (retro & upcoming), tutorial creation and office hours.\n\n**Transaction: **\n9 eth to: theNounishProf.eth: 0xCEEd9585854F12F81A0103861b83b995A64AD915\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "**TLDR:** Create a great experience for discovering mints by DAOs and making droposals.\n\n\nBuilder DAO has an opportunity to help nounish DAOs grow their audiences and treasuries via droposals and grow the Builder DAO’s treasury at the same time. This is a proposal to design and build a microsite to showcase and create droposals created by nounish DAOs. \n\n\nThe idea is to reinforce the feedback loop of giving droposal mints better visibility, leading to increased discovery of DAOs, leading to supporting artists and growing a treasury via protocol rewards and mint fees, leading to more droposals by DAOs.\n\n\nThis will benefit Builder DAO specifically with a portion of the protocol fee from mints created sent to the treasury.\n\n\n**Opportunities**\n\n\n- Grow BuilderDAO’s revenue via Zora protocol rewards from DAOs creating droposals and minting ux\n- Increase number of droposals created and minted by promoting droposal mints on DAO pages and on the nouns.build landing page\n- Give DAOs a home for their drops\n\n\n**Proof of concept sprint**\n\n\nInstead of building out a full version to start, I’m proposing a shorter sprint to create a proof of concept. The hope is that the value add becomes clear by having a few daos using the proof of concept and sending protocol rewards to the Builder DAO treasury.\n\n\n**Sprint plan:** work with daos planning to release droposals in the near future to get them set up on the tool. Let it run for a few weeks to prove out the concept, gather feedback, roadmap out the next sprint, and then come back to Builder DAO for additional funding to continue building.\n\n\n**Proof of concept scope (scaled back from previous draft)**\n\n- Functional droposal creation ux\n- Dao page showcasing drops\n- Mint page for each droposal\n- Simple landing page\n- Mints will happen on the DAO’s native chain. ie. a DAO on Base will mint their droposals on Base, an L1 DAO will mint theirs on L1, etc.\n\n\n**Potential future features**\n\n\n- DAO-specific mint page for each drop (mint page within DAO wrapper)\n- DAO-specific token detail page\n- Droposal creation ux, including support for 1155 drops\n- Display mints from L1 and L2 DAOs\n- L2 mints for L1 DAOs\n- Alternate governance contract for drops (similar to what Agora is building)\n- Playlists for audio & video mints\n\n\n**Timeline**\n- ~4 weeks\n\n\n**Comp**\n- 10 eth + 10% of protocol rewards from droposal mints done using the tool\n",

I’ve been in Nouns for over a year now and I’ve contributed to many different projects like Agora, Explorer Grants, and more recently [Mogu](https://www.mogu.wtf) and [Propdates](https://propdates-app.vercel.app/). \n\n\n**Project**\n\nNeokry built the L2 Migration contracts and they are currently being audited. More help is needed to complete the front-end of this feature.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Proposal Checkpoints - a user experience to guide DAO members through the process of creating proposals for migration (#1 - Pause Actions, #2 - Deploy DAO to L2, #3 Transfer Funds).\n- Claiming UX - how DAO members claim and see their new tokens once the DAO has been migrated to L2\n- Site-wide improvements - linking between old L1’s and new L2’s, messaging about migration, etc..\n\nProduct brief:\nhttps://hackmd.io/@isaaccyn/prd-l2-migration\n\n**Details**\n\nAiming to have this completed in one month of part-time (20 hours / week) work.\n3 ETH (around $4,700 at time of writing).\n\nAs the proposed compensation amount is small, we have chosen to have the funds transferred directly to vandelaytech.eth (martin's wallet).",

Should that fail to pass, we will omit from the scope.\n- Revenue from droposals via Zora protocol rewards\n    - Builder DAO will earn revenue on collection deployments and mints via the new droposals interface built by Ripe\n- Flat fee on Collection + claims\n    - Builder dao will earn revenue on a flat claim fee when users claim Collection + NFTs.\n\n## Funding Request\n$18,750 USD / Month for 6 months (12 ETH/ month @ $1600 ETH/USD price)\n\nTotal of $112,500 USDC streamed via Sablier (Total ~70 ETH @ $1600 ETH/USD price)\n\n#### Why the increased rate\n- Majority of focus shifting to protocol engineering.\n- Deep knowledge of smart contracts and Builder protocol required, distinct from frontend work.\n- Complex nature of protocol development including testing, reviews and audits to ensure security. \n- Much higher level of responsibility and attention to detail.\n- Majority of previous residency goals met.\n\n## Multisig\n*The equivalent of ~$120k (to absorb potential volatility in ETH from time period between submission and execution) would be sent to a multisig as outlined below. They would then convert $112,500 worth of ETH to USDC, set up the Sablier stream and then send back the remaining ETH to the DAO.\n\nGnosis Safe to handle Neokry's transaction:\n\n- 0x0bFcef6f9389d209D8D943ebA2893156fb5Ea929\n\nSigners:\n\n- zaak.eth: 0x77ac30452890E5210CB334f601a0A6E8F0A5201B\n- neokry.eth: 0x04bfb0034F24E424489F566f32D1f57647469f9E\n- thenounishprof.eth: 0xCEEd9585854F12F81A0103861b83b995A64AD915\n\nRecipient:\n\n- neokry.eth: 0x04bfb0034F24E424489F566f32D1f57647469f9E",

      "title": "Disbursement Request for Estimated Tax Payment For BuilderDAO",
      "content": "**Summary:** This proposal seeks approval for a disbursement of 132 ETH from the Builder DAO treasury to the Operations Working Group wallet. The funds will be used to cover an estimated tax payment of 132 ETH due on September 15, 2023, ensuring compliance with federal tax obligations.\n\n**Issue/Context:**\nAs outlined at the establishment of the DAO, Builder DAO is subject to taxation under US law due to its activities (see [Prop 2](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/2)). The DAO’s UNA structure allows the DAO to pay taxes on an entity level (individual members are not personally liable for taxes). \n\nBecause it is in the best interest of the DAO to fulfill its tax obligations accurately and promptly, the DAO granted the Operations Working Group the authority to seek guidance to quantify the DAO’s tax obligations and ensure timely payment (see [Prop 58](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/58)). \n\nThe Ops Working Group engaged a bookkeeper (JDFI) and accounting firm (Deloitte) to determine our tax liability and payment schedule. They have concluded that our estimated tax liability is approximately 132 ETH, due September 15, 2023. \n\nBy covering the estimated tax liability with this disbursement, we avoid potential legal and financial complications. Additional context on the DAO’s tax obligations are outlined in this [previously provided Builder DAO Tax FAQ ](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1042889124983623730/1061036058344702002/Builder_DAO_-_Taxes_and_Information_Collection_FAQ.pdf)and in this [Discourse post](https://forum.nouns.build/t/prop-25-update-and-compliance-game-plan/41). \n\n**Proposal:** A disbursement of 132 ETH from the DAO treasury to the Operations Working Group wallet. This amount will be used solely to cover estimated taxes for the DAO, ensuring compliance with tax regulations. The following steps will be taken:\n\n- Initiate the transfer of 132 ETH to the Operations Working Group wallet.\n- Compile necessary documentation and collaborate with tax professionals to accurately report and pay the estimated taxes.\n- Work with Utopia and Bridge.xyz to submit tax remittance (paid in ETH from the Operations Working Group wallet and converted to USD using Utopia/Bridge’s services)\n- Report back to the DAO once the estimated tax has been paid and once we have a final return.\n- Any unused funds shall be returned to the DAO treasury.\n\n**North Star Check:** This proposal aligns with the mission of the DAO by demonstrating responsible financial management and legal compliance under our existing legal structure as an UNA.\n\n**Accountability:** The funds will be allocated as follows:\n\n132 ETH for tax payment\n\nPaid on or before 9/15/2023\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n**Transfer of funds:** Within 2 days of proposal approval\n\n**Estimated tax payment:** No later than 9/15/2023\n\n**Success Metrics:** \n\nThe success of this proposal will be measured by:\n\n- Timely and accurate tax reporting and payment\n- Limited legal or financial consequences related to tax compliance\n- Transparent communication regarding the process and outcome\n\n**Treasury Impact:** \nTotal amount requested: 132 ETH \n\n**Percentage of treasury funds requested:** Approximately 24.2%\n\n**Transparency:** There are no conflicts of interest or disclosures related to this proposal.\n\n**Authors:** Lilac.eth & Shaz\n\n**Tax Information:** The responsible party for tax reporting are the UNA administrators who will work alongside tax professionals to ensure accurate reporting and payment.\n\n",

      "content": "![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJgA2x32n.png)\n\n**TL;DR:** Offer [BotFrens](https://botfrens.com) premium bots for all Builder DAOs for **~8.6Ξ**/year\n\n# About\n[The Builder](https://twitter.com/builder_dao_bot), [Nouns](https://twitter.com/nouns_bot), [BLVKHVND](https://twitter.com/blvkhvnd_bot), [Purple](https://warpcast.com/purplebot), and a number of other Nounish DAOs utilize BotFrens to share on-chain activity on Twitter, Discord, and Farcaster. These bots are crucial for keeping the DAO communities informed and engaged. With this proposal, we aim to cover the operational costs to make BotFrens free for all Nounish DAOs for one year. \n\nThe BotFrens team, funded by the [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/vote/144), [Builder](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/0xee46bb8653d187d2d0266fe9d1bc68cda7bd45c6b8bda59a5b788e5619503d6b), and [Purple DAOs](https://nouns.build/dao/ethereum/0xa45662638e9f3bbb7a6fecb4b17853b7ba0f3a60/vote/0xd621637cac452368ba232a2447d018ffdc7eaefddd2431c8bad5a87fdb5c69bc), has consistently delivered high-quality work. As of today, over **40 Nounish Bots that have collectively shared ~200K** posts in the last six months. Here’s what the customers are saying: \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJnDsti63.png)\n\n\n# Benefit to the BuilderDAO + Ecosystem (North Star Check)\nFor a thriving ecosystem, we need developers, creators, and active communities. By paying for  this service, we support developers and give Nounish DAOs a powerful tool. Plus, every sponsored DAO bot will share promotional messages (tbd) driving additional traffic to the Builder:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkDwYfST3.png)\n\n*The BotFrens team will collaborate with the Nouns Builder community to compile a collection of posts, ensuring they are fun, varied, and not spammy. These posts will be added to the DAO bots during the upgrade.*\n\n# Benefit for individual DAOs\nIn this proposal, individual DAOs receive Premium BotFrens accounts. With these, they can share unlimited posts across multiple social platforms and gain access to premium behaviors. Any active Builder/Nouns DAO would be eligible to receive an account upgrade by filing a support request on the [BotFrens Discord](https://discord.gg/EqZkPb77TV).\n\n# Cost Breakdown\nThe BotFrens premium plan costs $29/month, which amounts to approximately 0.16E per year. As of today, there are 41 Nounish bots live on BotFrens. We anticipate that the number of live bots will at least double within the next six to eight months. To reach the 8.6E price tag, we doubled the current number of bots and applied a discount of roughly 46%. \n\n````\n100 bots * 0.16/yr = 16E * 0.4625 Discount = 8.6E\n````\n\nThe Builder DAO plan will be capped at 200 DAOs. If fully utilized, this will represent a discount of approximately 80% compared to the standard BotFrens rate.\n\n# Success Metrics\nThe key performance indicator (KPI) is the number of DAOs using the service. We anticipate onboarding between 150 and 200 DAOs to BotFrens over the next year.\n\n\n# Reporting and Support \nBotFrens agrees to provide BuilderDAO with the following data on a monthly basis:\n\n* Number of individual DAOs utilizing the BuilderDAO plan.\n* Total number of bots (one DAO can have a Discord bot, a Farcaster bot, etc.)\n* Breakdown of bots by social channel\n* Number of posts shared\n\nBotFrens is committed to continue supporting existing functionality and to add support for L2s. Over the past several weeks, we added support for BASE and Optimism, and plan to introduce ZORA support in the future.\n\n\n# What Happens After One Year\nOur goal is to build a sustainable business and grow alongside the BuilderDAO ecosystem. We aim to be paid directly by DAOs, and we hope that, over the next year, the ecosystem will mature—with both enhanced tools and successful DAOs—enabling them to directly pay for services like BotFrens.\n\n# Treasury Impact\n8.6E which represents 0.0157% of the total treasury\n\n# Taxes\nBotFrens is a US-based entity and will assume a tax liability for this payment.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sk1xU-h3n.png)",

The festival itself will be booked and handled by PC DAO members, while also other members will be preforming and displaying 3D and AR art during the event. The goal is to take whats being built onchain and bring it to a space familiar and enjoyed by all, introducing new faces to the DAO ecosystem while also accomplishing the core values of PC DAO, at a time where SF/Bay area needs a positive boost of cultural value. The entire event will be geared towards tastefully introducing individuals to the capabilities of a Nounish DAO. The icing on the cake, a builder themed carnival esc dunk tank that will allow on chain and irl purchases to make attempts to dunk Portion Club DAO members, the entire event will be filmed photographed and used as a positive beacon towards our Builder DAO ecosyetm  \n\nWho: Portion Club DAO (SF Bay Area arts collective and oncahin collaboration)\nWhat: An all day festival with web3 information and art found throughout, headliner and DJ after hours party\nWhen: August 19th-August 20th, 2023\nWhere: SF Bay Area.\nWhy: To celebrate and parade Portion Club DAO and Builder as your friendly neighborhood DAO, prepared to onboard and facilitate web3 adjacent events, and also highlighting the capabilities of Nounish DAO's in the public eye\n \nFunding Request: 5 ETH sponsorship\n\n\n \n\nPortion Club DAO is seeking an additional sponsoship to help with event costs, event staff, and exhibition displays. We have extensive experience executing similar events in the past at a high level. \n\nFor a full breakdown of the event, and additional imagery, please visit our public deck. \n\nhttps://www.canva.com/design/DAFVDtvV3Lw/V7VxIQ1hGUFD5W8vuWeoVA/view?utm_content=DAFVDtvV3Lw&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink\n\n\nThe event is chance to showcase digital art and music backed by NFTs within DAO's supported by our ecosystem.

The ticket will count as IRL admission to the event. There will also be a builder watermarked stream available day of, the watermark will be clickable and lead to The Portion CLub Builder DAO page. The campaign will be memes & posters that will be spread out untill the day of the event. The irl part of the event will have a dunk tank with a branded poster of this Portion, Portion Club members will be in the dunk tank, and holders of the on-chain ticket will be given an attempt to dunk the member. As always the nounish branded $coops cart will be there as the Ice Cream Social on-boarding success as it has come to be known. As a final attempt to bridge the connection between onboarding new artists to our DAO and the Builder DAO ecosystem as a whole, we will be offering a sign-up for later date sessions on \"What Is Builder\" \"All You Have To Do is Show Up\" \"How To Mint A Song\" tutorial through the DAO. ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByFSdm1h3.png)![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJkv_7132.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJl_u71h2.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy7EfN13n.jpg)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkxXmVJ22.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rymWrVy2n.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryOtvEJ33.png)\n\n\n\n# **Proliferations**\n- Streaming w/ Watermark\n- Posters\n- Banner\n- Tarp\n- Builder/Portion Slime Party Favor\n- Meme Campaign \n- Day of AR art \n- On Chain Art\n- $coops Builder/Portion branded\n- Follow up sign up list for more info\n\n\n\n\n# **Northstar Check**\n\n## **Builder DAO is dedicated to the creation and development of free and accessible DAO infrastructure as a public good.**\n\nPortion Club and Builder DAO are natural partners. They are both Nounish DAO's, that share a common vision for the future of the Web, albeit from different angles. Buildr DAO focuses on easing the path for those who want to build on Web3 by creating quality learning materials. Portion Club DAO, on the other hand, is all about managing and connecting creative members to the digital art scene in the web3 space, by supporting Portion Club DAO, Builder DAO can contribute to the integration of art and culture into Web3 in the SF/Bay Area, while simultaneously reaching a diverse group of creators who might need Buildr DAO's resources. This partnership can help the entire web3 community flourish, as it brings together builders and artists under a common goal.\n\nPortion Club DAO focuses on creating experiences that bring together emerging talent and established figures in the space, connecting local artists and collectives to an international audience, while bringing the coolest of the underground to the world of web 3 events. \n\nPortion Club's mission of connecting emerging talents and established artists to an international audience dovetails with Builder DAO's goal of fostering an inclusive and collaborative Web 3 community. By creating unique experiences that amalgamate the traditional art world with the underground, Portion Club opens new pathways for creative exploration in the Web 3 space. These experiences, in turn, inspire new perspectives and innovative solutions that align with Builder DAO's vision of driving step-change improvements through technology. This fusion of art and technology not only broadens the Web 3 narrative but also cultivates a diverse ecosystem where creators and builders coexist and collaborate.\n\nPortion Club has created on and off chain such as:\nThe First Generative Album on Chain\nOne of the first traditionally modeled web3 mixtapes on ZORA\nPetty Fest 22'\nScoops Web3 Ice Cream Social onboarding events \nClicked (a web3 event in the east bay)\nPortion Club members gallery shows \nParticipation in NFT/Zoratopia Oakland \nParticipation in FWB Fest 22'/23\n\n\n\n\n\n## **Treasury Impact**\n\nPortion Club is requesting 5 eth which is currently less than 1% of the Builder Treasury.\n\n\n\n\n\n## **Team**\n\n\nOur Team is widely known through the web3 and IRL community of being trustworthy, reliable buldrs. Founding members like Taifa Nia, Studio_Dad, Ricky Lake, & Wables all have a history of being public figures who are responsible for activations, creative projects, and large scale events.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryudQqi83.jpg)\n",

      "title": "Fam - A platform for Nounish music communities",
      "content": "**Summary**\n\nWe intend to build a new platform that enables music collectives and onchain record labels to easily create a Nouns style community where members can actively participate and collaborate. We believe that music communities are uniquely positioned to showcase the benefits and scalability of the Nouns model and hope that by providing creators with new tools to incentivise and grow their community we can catalyse a more symbiotic relationship between artists and fans.\n\nA diverse ecosystem of platforms leveraging the Nouns Builder protocol will unlock new market segments and help to attract a wider range of individual contributors and projects. By supporting projects that are helping to bring creativity and imagination onchain Builder DAO can position itself as not just a public goods infrastructure provider but also a driver of cultural change. \n\nWe want to create a future where hundreds of thousands of music communities can coordinate, cross-pollinate and flourish on top of open source protocols.\n\n\n\n**Why music?**\n\nSimple, we believe that music communities can scale the Nouns model more widely than any other and benefit most from its adoption.\n\nMusic collectives have long been a powerful cultural driver and have had a significant impact in shaping the music scene as we know it. The Wu Tang Clan, Swedish House Mafia, The Grateful Dead, Odd Future and many more are examples of what can be created when collaboration and experimentation are a core principle of the group's existence. What does that look like onchain, and at scale?\n\nOf all the communities that exist online, some of the largest are the fanbases of musicians and bands (think Taylor Swift’s Swifties or K-Pop group BTS’s A.R.M.Y). Superfans crave a sense of belonging and want to be part of a club of like minded individuals who share their passions. The Nouns model allows for active participation rather than passive consumption.\n\nWe’ve already seen a number of artists and collectives experimenting with releasing their music onchain as it provides better economic opportunities, more equitable distribution of royalties, and allows them to form one-on-one connections with fans and supporters. [The Park](https://twitter.com/thepark) and [CHAOS](https://twitter.com/headless_chaos) are some great recent examples. We believe this trend will accelerate and expect to see many more onchain music communities flourish over the coming years.\n\n\n**Background**\n\nWe recently conducted a series of user interviews with artists, collectors and music collectives in the web3 space. Some of the insights that came from these conversations included:\n\n- Artists find building an aligned community hard and time consuming\n- Fans are fragmented across various social platforms and apps, each requiring a different approach to engage\n- Artists want to create a more symbiotic relationship with their fans and supporters\n- Fans want to participate in the journey of their favourite artists and be recognised for their contributions\n- Artists spend more time promoting their work and managing their brand than doing the thing that they love, making music\n\n\n**Fam Works**\n\nFam Works is a collective of creatives and builders who want to catalyse a new era in onchain music and birth a vibrant ecosystem of artists, collectives and labels who collaborate and support one another. Our mission is to educate a new generation of artists about innovative ways of coordinating, creating and releasing music by leveraging onchain tools and protocols.\n\nFam Works will be launched as a Nouns Builder community on the Zora Network in the next few weeks and will be responsible for: \n\n- Funding ongoing development of the Fam platform\n- Providing seed funding to new communities launching on Fam\n- Facilitating events and programs to onboard artists into web3 and educate them on current best practices and tools\n- Developing partnerships with brands and organisations who are contributing to the propagation of music culture on the internet (eg. Red Bull, AIAIAI, The Fader)\n- Launching collaborative music projects and experiments (our recent [Soulquest at Fest](https://mirror.xyz/withfam.eth/bYa9vrnth5DQLRonrEc9C-2NfK3evVuet0PISRgsZPM) project is an example)\n\n\n**Proposal**\n\nWe are seeking support from Builder DAO in the form of **20ETH** to build a [SLC](https://blog.asmartbear.com/slc.html) (simple, loveable, complete) version of the Fam platform, which will leverage the core functionality of Nouns Builder and provide creators with features to help attract new members and scale their communities. We have estimated the SLC will take 3-4 months to build balancing a part-time workload.\n\n*Lead Developer*\n300 hours (part-time) at 0.04ETH ($75USD) per hour = 12 ETH ($22,500)\n\n*Project Lead & Product Designer*\n200 hours (full-time) at 0.04ETH (~$75USD) per hour = 8 ETH ($14,250)\n\nThe funds will be sent to *withfam.eth*, converted to USDC upon receipt and placed into a LlamaPay stream or similar\n\n\n**Barriers to adoption**\n\nThe Nouns Builder tool is great for quickly spinning up DAOs around a shared vision or idea, but for music communities to adopt it more widely we believe a bespoke solution is necessary—one that caters to the specific needs and use cases of these communities.\n\n- Creators want a way to showcase their latest NFT drops to their community and provide them with unique experiences. We propose leveraging the composability of web3 to allow creators and communities to embed their latest NFT drops on their community profile page. Some of the platforms we intend to leverage include Zora, Sound, Catalog, Metalabel and more\n- Creating generative artworks is cumbersome and confusing to many users who are unfamiliar with creating NFTs. We propose building a simple artwork generator that can be used to produce generative artworks without needing a designer and complex folder systems\n- Reducing complexity is key if we want to see wider adoption of Nouns Builder style communities. We plan to use language that is approachable and design experiences that do not alienate individuals who are not web3 native\n\n\n**Scope**\n\nThe first version of the platform will include all the functionality of the Nouns Builder platform but with some additional features specifically targeting music communities:\n\n- A community discovery page showcasing trending and new communities\n- A place to showcase the communities latest NFT drops\n- A custom artwork generator\n- A new UI for creation flow, auctions, profiles and proposals\n- A 2% ETH interface fee from all auctions on the platform. This fee will flow to the Fam Works DAO to provide a sustainable funding model for future development. The Fam Works DAO will govern the fee parameters\n\n\n**Design exploration**\n\n[Figma prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/KbE5bCHx2re5C7QKfHALol/Fam-POC?page-id=166%3A229&type=design&node-id=1039-2&viewport=237%2C70%2C0.05&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=1039%3A2&mode=design&t=B20Dg0UGwLtqZLvJ-1)\n\n*Please note these are early design experiments and not what the shipped product will look like\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeibwl2tiendkbaixshcizpfnh2ge5ojoc5xowbfzaymhhjigf3rhlm)\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeia7elqqcyr7iqqqn22au73hb7ebs57g4urvsxogwqxtdoqw4uwotm)\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeicyziuja2kb7hpfch7af6dtiv47isqwfrt4ept5ceydpsp524zcyy)\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeidml76kxsyxlya3z52xuco6i7rip3twgpqzmok4qoaqxotfkxt744)\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeifbmlchkqfv7ynpcxqefln7tdjxhegrmwxmkjapa4tmhbu457yx5q)\n\n\n**Team**\n\n*[Nick Smith](https://twitter.com/iamnickdoteth) - Project Lead & Product Design*\nCurrently working on Fam.

Has previously worked on projects for [Songcamp](https://song.camp/), [CHAOS](https://chaos.build/), [Nightrun](https://www.nightrun.art/)\n\n\n**Timeline**\n\n*5 weeks design*\nUser flows, Visual / UX design, Prototyping, User testing, Design revisions, Design QA\n\n*7.5 weeks development (15 weeks part-time)*\nSmart contract development, Front-end development, QA and revisions\n\n\n**Goals**\n\nOur objective is to demonstrate that the Nouns model is an optimal solution for creating sustainable communities at scale. In an industry where major record labels and algorithms largely dictate the rules, many musicians and bands find it challenging to gain recognition and grow their fan base. By offering tools that enable fans to meaningfully participate in a creator's journey, we are hopeful to witness the evolution and growth of new modes of community coordination so that a more equitable music industry can emerge.\n\n\n**Future plans**\n\nOnce we have built the initial SLC and started onboarding creators and their communities we intend to add additional features that make it easier for creators to promote their music and connect with fans. Some things we’ve been exploring include:\n\n- Tools for communities to easily publish onchain media and create rewards for their communities leveraging the Zora protocol and others\n- Token-gated chat for community members leveraging the Farcaster protocol\n- Multiple membership models/tiers to improve accessibility and provide more entry points for fans and supporters\n- Launch Fam Works as a Builder DAO on the Zora Network and provide seed funding to a group of early music communities and projects\n\n\n**Community links**\n\n[Discord](https://discord.gg/nuYwCzDjpc)\n\n[Twitter](https://twitter.com/withfam_)\n\n[Website](https://withfam.xyz/)",

      "title": "Ratification of Mission Vision Values for BuilderDAO",
      "content": "**Summary:** This proposal seeks the ratification of the Mission, Vision, and Values statement for Builder DAO, which emphasizes the creation of DAO infrastructure as a public good, supporting the Builder Protocol, and fostering an innovative and collaborative DAO ecosystem. The proposal aims to solidify the DAO's direction and guide its actions towards the stated mission and vision.\n\n**Issue/Context:** This proposal builds upon the foundation of Builder DAO and aims to provide clarity and alignment for the DAO's mission, vision, and values. By establishing a ratified statement, the DAO can ensure that its activities and initiatives are in line with its core principles.\n\n**Proposal:** We propose the ratification of the following Mission/Vision/Values statement for Builder DAO:\n\n### **MISSION**\n\n**Powering Onchain Communities.**\n\nThe Builder DAO mission is to develop DAO infrastructure as a public good, enabling decentralized, inclusive, and transparent decision-making processes that empower onchain communities to shape their collective futures.\n\n### **VISION**\n\n**To maintain and expand the Builder Protocol while supporting the Builder DAO ecosystem**\n\n**Maintaining and expanding the Builder Protocol:**\n\nWe envision a future where the Builder Protocol serves as a robust and reliable foundation for DAOs. By maintaining and continuously improving the protocol, the aim is to provide a secure, efficient, and scalable framework that empowers individuals and communities to govern their resources and make collective decisions. With Builder DAO maintaining the protocol, other DAOs can focus on their communities without having to worry about the tech, which is built on a trusted foundation and maintained by a dedicated community. Through diligent stewardship and technical innovation, we strive to create a self-sustaining protocol that ensures the longevity and stability of the entire Builder DAO ecosystem.\n\n**Supporting the Builder DAO Ecosystem:**\n\nWe envision a thriving DAO ecosystem, characterized by diverse and flourishing decentralized projects. To realize this vision, Builder DAO is committed to providing comprehensive support to DAO builders and communities. We intend to develop and offer a range of tools, resources, and educational materials that empower individuals to establish and operate DAOs effectively. Furthermore, we aim to facilitate DAO incubation initiatives to nurture promising projects, enabling them to kickstart their initiatives and catalyze the growth of the ecosystem. Through these efforts, we aim to foster an environment where creativity, collaboration, and innovation thrive within the Builder DAO community.\n\nBy pursuing this mission and vision, we aspire to democratize decision-making, foster global participation, and drive the adoption of decentralized governance models. Together with the onchain community, we intend to build a sustainable and inclusive future powered by DAOs.\n\n### **VALUES**\n\n**Transparency, Mutual Respect, Accountability, and Diversity and Inclusion.**\n\nNouns Builder strives to build a community that is welcoming to all and to create an environment that is conducive to collaboration. Some welcome behaviors include being proactive, engaged, communicating in a collaborative manner, engaging in good faith, leading with empathy, and accepting constructive feedback with grace. Unacceptable behaviors include ad hominem attacks.\n\n**North star check:** This proposal clarifies the mission of Builder DAO by ratifying the mission, vision, and values statement. It further solidifies the commitment to creating DAO infrastructure as a public good and supporting the Builder DAO ecosystem.\n\n**Accountability:** Ultimately it will be up to each DAO member of the community to view future governance proposals in the context of furthering the Mission, Vision, and Values of Nouns Builder. The MVV statement provides a north star that may govern the direction and decision making of the DAO.\n\n**Treasury Impact:** No treasury funds are being requested for this proposal.\n\n**Timeline:** The ratification process will commence immediately upon approval and is expected to be completed within two weeks.\n\n**Success Metrics:** Success for this proposal would be the successful ratification of the Mission/Vision/Values statement and the alignment of the Builder DAO community around these principles. This will be measured by the widespread acceptance and adoption of the statement within the DAO.\n\n**Treasury Impact:** No funds are being requested for this proposal.\n",

The festival itself will be booked and handled by PC DAO members, while also other members will be preforming and displaying 3D and AR art during the event. The goal is to take whats being built onchain and bring it to a space familiar and enjoyed by all, introducing new faces to the DAO ecosystem while also accomplishing the core values of PC DAO, at a time where SF/Bay area needs a positive boost of cultural value. The entire event will be geared towards tastefully introducing individuals to the capabilities of a Nounish DAO. The icing on the cake, a builder themed carnival esc dunk tank that will allow on chain and irl purchases to make attempts to dunk Portion Club DAO members, the entire event will be filmed photographed and used as a positive beacon towards our Builder DAO ecosyetm  \n\nWho: Portion Club DAO (SF Bay Area arts collective and oncahin collaboration)\nWhat: An all day festival with web3 information and art found throughout, headliner and DJ after hours party\nWhen: August 19th-August 20th, 2023\nWhere: SF Bay Area.\nWhy: To celebrate and parade Portion Club DAO and Builder as your friendly neighborhood DAO, prepared to onboard and facilitate web3 adjacent events, and also highlighting the capabilities of Nounish DAO's in the public eye\n \nFunding Request: 4 ETH \n\n\n \n\nPortion Club DAO is seeking an additional funding to help with venue costs, event staff, and digital exhibition displays.

They are both Nounish DAO's, that share a common vision for the future of the Web, albeit from different angles. Buildr DAO focuses on easing the path for those who want to build on Web3 by creating quality learning materials. Portion Club DAO, on the other hand, is all about managing and connecting creative members to the digital art scene in the web3 space, by supporting Portion Club DAO, Builder DAO can contribute to the integration of art and culture into Web3 in the SF/Bay Area, while simultaneously reaching a diverse group of creators who might need Buildr DAO's resources. This partnership can help the entire web3 community flourish, as it brings together builders and artists under a common goal.\n\nPortion Club DAO focuses on creating experiences that bring together emerging talent and established figures in the space, connecting local artists and collectives to an international audience, while bringing the coolest of the underground to the world of web 3 events. \n\nPortion Club's mission of connecting emerging talents and established artists to an international audience dovetails with Builder DAO's goal of fostering an inclusive and collaborative Web 3 community. By creating unique experiences that amalgamate the traditional art world with the underground, Portion Club opens new pathways for creative exploration in the Web 3 space. These experiences, in turn, inspire new perspectives and innovative solutions that align with Builder DAO's vision of driving step-change improvements through technology. This fusion of art and technology not only broadens the Web 3 narrative but also cultivates a diverse ecosystem where creators and builders coexist and collaborate.\n\nPortion has created on and off chain such as:\nThe First Generative Album on Chain\nOne of the first traditionally modeled web3 mixtapes on ZORA\nPetty Fest 22'\nScoops Web3 Ice Cream Social onboarding events \nClicked (a web3 event in the east bay)\nPortion Club members gallery shows \nParticipation in NFT/Zoratopia Oakland \nParticipation in FWB Fest 22'/23'\n\n \n\n\n## **Treasury Impact**\n\nPortion Club is requesting 4 eth which is currently .68% of the Builder Treasury.\n\n\n\n\n## **Team**\n\n\nOur Team is widely known through the web3 and IRL community of being trustworthy, reliable buldrs. Founding members like Taifa Nia, Studio_Dad, \"Ricky Lake\", & \"Wables\" all have a history of being public figures who are responsible for activations, creative projects, and large scale events.\n\n**Transparency:** We hope to receive funds to help pay for the event not because we don't believe it will be successful, but because we look to seek support from our DAO ecosystem the same way we have supported it in return, this prop will provide hope, belief, and tangibility for our DAO and the entire Nouns/Builder space as people will be able to attach it to trustworthy faces both on and off the chain. \n\n\n\n## **Transactions**\n\nBuilder to release a one time payment of 4 eth to BuilderDao at the address \n0x162421A61c5d40ffe3bC6D5EF546C00de4f49830 (Portion Club Treasury @Nouns)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryudQqi83.jpg)",

Devrel.\n- Raid Guild: Contributor. fullstack developer.\n\n### Past Builder Contributions\n\n- Farcaster 'Feed' Integration V0.\n    - DAO-specific feed built directly into the Builder App.\n    - Research and collaboration with Farcaster folks to build a foundation for further integration.  \n    - https://github.com/ourzora/nouns-builder/actions/runs/5460129924\n- Members List View (coming soon)\n    - https://github.com/ourzora/nouns-builder/pull/300\n- Product Ideation with Isaac and Neokry.\n    - https://github.com/ourzora/nouns-builder/issues/286\n    - https://github.com/ourzora/nouns-builder/issues/276\n    - https://github.com/ourzora/nouns-builder/issues/275\n ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkoWl_Ith.png)\n ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJGBx_It3.png)\n\n### Residency Scope\n\nPart-time. 20+ hours per week. \n\n\n### Roadmap \n\nI spent some time working with Zaak and Neokry on a roadmap of client-side features to build while Neokry begins development on protocol features. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyIJm9xq2.png)\n\nHere are the items that we came up with. \n\n**Short/Mid Term:**\n- Email notifications. A service that allows the user to subscribe to DAO events or auctions. We plan to alert the user of the following events:\n    - New auction \n    - When the user is outbid\n    - When you have won the auction + settlement reminder\n    - New Proposal \n    - Voting period open\n    - One day before voting \n    - Proposal result (Pass or fail)\n    - Proposal requires execution\n- Auction Chart. A chart that displays all of the final auction sale prices over time. \n- Exploration around DAO Fiat payment services. The exact implementation of this is still in discovery, but either we build an integration with bridge.xyz or set up a flow with Utopia. \n- Token Buyer TX type. Similar to or a version of Nouns Token Buyer. Application integration that allows a DAO to trade ETH for an ERC-20 token. \n- DAO Context. These are smaller pragmatic features that add more content, richness, and context to DAOs, which will hopefully inspire more users to participate. Some of these features could include:\n    - Rich Text information in the About section \n    - Expanding social links. \n\n*Note: Some of the implementation details of these features may change based on technical constraints. Also, given the large scope of these features, and the limited time of the residency, it is possible that not all the features listed here will be completed within this residency term.*\n\n**Long Term/Extras**\n- A simple static docs page that organizes all of the builder DAO content and affiliate projects, similar to nouns.center. \n    - There's also been discussion about creating a fully onchain DAO CMS that can be made available to all DAOs. Imagine being able to ratify documents through governance and having that data display either in the app or through static site templates. \n- Unlocking the Metadata renderer. What else can the metadata renderer do? I want to make Builder DAOs more expressive and see how we can make changes to the client so that we can open up the design space for artists. \n\n\n\n**Overarching Goals:**\n\nIn my previous draft, there was a heavier emphasis on sustainability for the DAO. However, this is still in the discovery stages, and I think it would be wise to implement based on the output of the various working groups who are tackling this challenge. \n\nAdditionally, I had also planned to integrate the client with new protocol developments. However, these new protocol features are still in development and will likely be a few months before they need integration into the application. \n\nWith that in mind, my goals for this term will be: \n- **Enhance the auction experience**, both for DAOs and bidders. DAOs should be able to use the auction chart to gauge interest in their DAO. Bidders should be able to get the auction information when it is important (email notifications). \n- **DAO Expressivity and Character:** I want to DAOs to be able to distinguish themselves and help attract new members. We can add new UI to enhance the character of each DAO and help orient members to where the DAO coordinates. Finally, I want to explore enriching the application experience by either opening up new patterns for creating art on the platform or giving DAOs the ability to store and ratify their content. \n- **Utility:** Some features, while unsexy, are still very useful and should be implemented. This could come in the form of organizing Builder DAOs links into a static docs page, or building integrations to allow the DAO to make payments in fiat. \n\n\n**Additional Value Add**\n- Assist Neokry with some maintenance and bug fixes. \n- Help with ideation and discovery for Builder DAO sustainability. I'd like to participate in some meetings and discovery sessions for potential features or updates that may help fund future development and DAO onboarding. \n- Help with product ideation and development sessions. I currently attend most product sessions with Zaak and Neokry. I'm very happy to continue doing so. \n- Perhaps some early discovery around devrel. I can tell Builder DAO is making efforts to attract developers to build on the protocol. I have some experience with Devrel and would be happy to help strategize. \n\n\n### Funding Request \n\n- 6,500 USD/Month for 3 Months. \n- Total of 19,500 USD.\n- 10.54 ETH market price of 1,848.85. *(Price at time of writing. Will recalculate when posting on-chain)*\n\n*The equivalent of ~$23k(12.44 ETH) (to absorb potential volatility in ETH from the time between submission and execution) would be sent to a multisig managed by trusted members of the community (Zaak, Neokry, and X). They would then convert $19.5k worth of ETH to USDC and create a Sablier stream. \n\n**Gnosis Safe to handle Jord's transactions:**\n\n- [0xC280FB2E5E6033932aF286BDa4520BfE1251C68a](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0xC280FB2E5E6033932aF286BDa4520BfE1251C68a)\n\n\n**Signers:**\n- zaak.eth 0x77ac30452890E5210CB334f601a0A6E8F0A5201B\n- Neokry.eth: 0x04bfb0034F24E424489F566f32D1f57647469f9E\n- ccarella.eth: 0x3B60e31CFC48a9074CD5bEbb26C9EAa77650a43F\n\n\n",

This will also allow for additional time overall for discussion prior to voting.\n\nThis would now be a 3 day vote delay with a 4 day voting period for a total of 7 days. If a proposal succeeds, there is an additional 48 hour queue period before the execution of the prop that transfers funds (9 day minimum funding process)\n\nAdditional discussion can be found here: \nhttps://discord.com/channels/1039595167910477936/1124100075992395886\n",

The hard work around community building by myself and Patti, plus Neokry and Zaak's efforts on the engineering side, have led to more active auctions, a significant number of new members, and more positive outlook on the future of the DAO. \n\nHighlights from the past three months include:\n\n* **FarCon sponsorship [[Prop 51](https://nouns.build/dao/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/0xe056defb1b496bec4d1e452aa24fcf318984407e4ccf8fe9464d1d3089ab9070)]**: With this prop we sponsored the inaugural Farcaster Conference with three members attending and speaking on the DAO panel (Prof Werder, Derek G. Taylor of The Park and Billz of Purple). We are still awaiting the video of the panel. This was an amazing proliferation of BuilderDAO, leading to new members and greater awareness of the Nouns Builder platform.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryOVAMt_h.png)\n\n\n* **Launched Builder Guild** and began the governance process by utilizing Nerman in discord. This was officially implemented as part of [[prop 59](https://nouns.build/dao/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/0x15c548013665c481227a2f7d7f991142974ce16c4d814c05cc1b074887ec7fe9)]. The Builder Guild meetings have been active and I look forward to more participation from Guild members. We also had a couple Guild members join BuilderDAO by purchasing their own token. Additional processes need to be implemented to ensure more active governance and we will need to start onboarding additional members of the guild this month.\n\n\n* **Marketing Communications [[Prop 57](https://nouns.build/dao/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/0x24382701f21d06302847438df72a253fabeeb5ed2fe46149f670558789554777)]**:\n    * Newsletter/Blog had been restarted https://paragraph.xyz/@builder and a Notion site with project updates https://0xsatori.notion.site/Builder-DAO-Proposal-Dashboard-a66f8a89dce64ed680a9c16eb2dec364?pvs=4 has been created by Satori. Both will provide a better flow of information to members.\n    \n    * Animated gifs of Builder tokens are ongoing with new tokens during this two week period being created to help bring attention to the art. These animations will also be incorporated as stickers in discord and gifs that can be shared on twitter. In addition, Graphicography will be doing 28 others after these are finished and will do some creation live in discord.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkTe5fFOh.gif)\n\n\n* **Overpriced Jpegs event sponsorship [[prop 61](https://nouns.build/dao/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/0xbfe850a01ef8a7cd16b269bbba8e8efaff366b79fa052dd716e51d6cc5d4e767)]**: Although this was a close vote, BuilderDAO will be sponsoring the last event on the OPJ tour which will be in LA with an interview with Betty from Deadfellaz. **Carly has sinced shouted out BuilderDAO and NounsBuilder on Twitter (https://twitter.com/carlypreilly/status/1673729798181474307?s=20)** and has even **joined the DAO (https://twitter.com/carlypreilly/status/1673759770904260608?s=20)**. Even if this prop had failed, it generated quite a bit of attention. I look forward to seeing the content produced from this event.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkT6-Xt_h.png)\n\n\n* Started utilizing the new Builder channel on Farcaster more and see this as a major opportunity to increase communication among DAO members. Greatly appreciate new BuilderDAO member DWR implementing BuilderDAO as one of the first channels. I noticed an increase in voting since that channel went live!\n\n* Started a weekly onboarding call on Thursdays at 4:30 in the discord. This has already provided a couple great conversations with new members and I look forward to this opportunity to chat with new members of BuilderDAO, new DAO founders and those with questions about launching a DAO on Nouns Builder.\n\n* Worked with Patti, Shahab and Zaak on Operations and will be continuing on the Ops team moving forward. (prop 58)\n\n* Fielded numerous inquiries about BuilderDAO and Nouns Builder via dm's.\n    \n\n\n**Still in Progress:**\n* Add Prop Lot as an idea generation temp check and location outside discord for discussions as another decentralized touchpoint.\n    * I've been in touch with Adel and this is still a work in progress. I hope by the end of this 3 month period, that Prop Lot will be implemented and we'll move idea development and generation to that platform.\n    \n* Design a DAO Incubator for nounish DAOs with the input of Builder Nouncil Reps.\n    * It was determined by the Ops team that this should wait until the L2 implementation.    \n\n* Work on utilizing BuilderBox content better via edited clips for social media and podcast content. And use this platform and others to highlight Nounish DAOs.\n    * Need to get better with this. We have had some amazing guests and spaces but need to find time to then turn this into content that can be shared after spaces as a podcast and audio clips.\n    \n![](https://i.imgur.com/C0KGnpU.jpg)\n\nLooking ahead, in addition to maintenance of the discord and Twitter Spaces, I'll be focusing on the following:\n\n\n* Outreach to individual DAOs for incorporation into Builder Guild and overall increased communication.\n\n* Builder Guild development so that it becomes a self-sustaining org with less direction from me and admin team.\n\n* Increasing attendance at newly launched On-boarding sessions.\n\n* Exploring ways to better communicate the current infinite prop house round to reach the right participants and get activity going.\n\n* Search for additional opportunities for BuilderDAO exposure in media and events to continue the momentum from the FarCon and OPJ props.\n\n* Development of a DAO bootcamp once L2 DAOs are available.\n\n* Experiment with adding streaming on Unlonely to reach a Farcaster audience as well. \n\n* Onboard more members of BuilderDAO to Farcaster to increase the effectiveness of that communication channel.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### The past couple months have brought more positive energy to the DAO and what we are doing is working!

Launched on the BanklessHQ platform, Overpriced Jpegs now boasts an average of 65,000 downloads a month on average plus extensive social media reach on Twitter, YouTube and Instagram. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1jDOr-un.png)\n\nThis prop is to sponsor the last stop on the OPJ Tour which is a live taping of the podcast which is then broadcast as a show itself, shared on all socials, and discussed in the weekly newsletter. The guest for this last show is Betty, founder of DeadFellaz. It will put Nouns Builder and BuilderDAO in front of those who are most influential in the space.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyRC_rb_n.png)\n\nThis prop is for 4 eth which is a discounted rate and will include our branding both in person and online. We will also have a few tickets for BuilderDAO members to attend for those in the LA area.  In addition, I’ll be sending some stickers, noggles and other merch to the event which will feature prominently in all of the content produced from the event.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SktOKSbO3.png)\n\nI attended the events in Miami and this is a room we want to be in! I do think we would regret passing on this opportunity to drive this level of attention to Nouns Builder and BuilderDAO for a relatively small ask. \n\nThe Sponsorship package pdf is available in the discord.\n\n**Links:**\n\n**Twitter:** https://twitter.com/carlypreilly  and https://twitter.com/overpricedjpegs \n\n**Apple podcasts**: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/overpriced-jpegs/id1591954323 \n\n**YouTube**: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgwYifaFPX3_FJe7MMWfmAg \n\n**Substack**: https://jpegs.banklesshq.com/ \n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkVFW9sU2.jpg)\n\n# **Northstar Check**\n\n## **Builder DAO is dedicated to the creation and development of free and accessible DAO infrastructure as a public good.**\n\nThis proposal furthers that mission by putting BuilderDAO in front of thousands in the industry, introducing Builder to many for the first time.

      "title": "Transfer Builder Protocol Contract Control from Zora to BuilderDAO",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal seeks to finalize the transfer of the Builder Protocol from Zora to BuilderDAO. \n\n## Context\n\nZora originally developed the Builder Protocol (“Protocol”), a set of smart contracts that allows users to create and deploy Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (“DAOs”) adopting technical, structural, and governance characteristics modeled after the NounsDAO. On November 15, 2022, Zora transferred governance control of the Protocol to BuilderDAO with the launch of the DAO, whereby the direction of the Protocol would be determined by vote of the DAO. To complete the full transfer of control of Builder Protocol to the DAO, Zora is now seeking to transfer control of Builder Protocol’s manager contract to BuilderDAO, so that BuilderDAO is solely responsible for ongoing control, maintenance, and improvement of Builder Protocol from both a governance and technical perspective. \n\n## Proposal\n\nBuilderDAO to accept control of the Builder Protocol manager contract at 0xd310A3041dFcF14Def5ccBc508668974b5da7174 from zora.eth. Zora will transfer the contract to BuilderDAO manually.\n\nZora and a Builder admin (lilac.eth) to sign an Asset Transfer Agreement memorializing this transfer. \n\n## Alignment with mission/vision\n\nZora believes that BuilderDAO is the rightful steward of the Protocol. The Protocol is at the core of the DAO - proliferating the Protocol is central to BuilderDAO’s mission and BuilderDAO is best positioned to: 1) address the needs of the DAO developer community; 2) maintain, administer, and develop the Protocol; 3) advocate for the Protocol; and 4) drive more users to the Protocol.  Zora also believes this transfer will economically benefit both itself (e.g. by driving more engagement with Zora’s core products and services and elevating Zora’s reputation) and the broader Builder and DAO developer communities by improving the Protocol and making it more usable. \n\t\n## Accountability\n\nFollowing this transfer, BuilderDAO shall be responsible for taking all actions required to facilitate the operation and development of the Protocol. This means addressing errors, responding to community feedback, and implementing and deploying improvements. This responsibility is shared by the DAO membership, subject to appropriate delegation via the DAO’s governance processes. \n\n## Treasury & Tax Impact\n\nZora is not requesting any payment in exchange for this transfer. It is anticipated that this transaction will have a tax neutral impact on Zora. \n\nThe DAO is also working with tax advisors to minimize the tax impact of receiving the IP.  However, there is some possibility that the DAO could incur some tax liability by accepting the IP. \n\n## Transparency\n\n**Zora**\n\n- Zora founded Builder DAO and holds 10% of the BuilderDAO governance tokens. \n- Zora maintains veto power over any governance proposal of the DAO for the time being, but is committed to limiting usage of this power only to extreme cases and working with the community to determine an alternative framework for this power. \n\n## Additional Transfer Considerations\n\n*Issue: Protocol Update Timing* - Once the transfer is complete, all changes to the Protocol must go through BuilderDAO’s proposal/governance process to take effect, including in emergency situations. For example, if the DAO approves an upgrade which inadvertently creates a compromise, another voting cycle will be required to fix the compromise.  This could potentially result in harm from the compromise during the voting period. \n\n*Potential Solution: Multi-Admin* - Public Assembly is working on a feature that would allow multiple parties to serve as the admin of a DAO Protocol contract (more info [here](https://forum.public---assembly.com/t/new-ownership-implementation-for-assemblypress/396)). Additional admins can be added or removed at the DAO’s discretion. Once the feature is live, BuilderDAO can consider adding and delegating responsibility to a third party admin to execute emergency protocol changes to address potential security risks.  \n\n## Author\n\nzora.eth\n\n## About the author\n\nZora founded Builder DAO and maintains 10% of the BuilderDAO governance tokens.

In creating this council, the idea is that they will also have a vote within BuilderDAO via delegation and their own token created via this prop.\n\nThis proposal sets out to do the following:\n\n1) Establish the Builder Guild with an initial group of representatives from nounish DAOs created on Nouns.Build:\n\n\n\n| Rep     | DAO    | \n| -------- | -------- | \n|Matas         | TOAD DAO\nTaifa    | Portion Club\nDerek G Taylor        | The Park\nSalief    | Public Assembly\nZamees         | Lil Toadz DAO\nLil Purple Blueberry/The Swami   | Blueberry DAO\nBillZ    | Purple\nGami        | ArtHaus\n\n*Ex-officio non-voting members*\t\n   Prof Werder,\tCommunity Resident\n   Zaak,\tproduct manager (Zora)\n   Neokry,\tEngineering Resident\n   Patti,\tBuilderDAO Admin.\n\n\n\n2)  Mint two BuilderDAO tokens to the Builder Guild multisig to allow for independent agency for this group of DAO representatives. This will also give votes in any future prop houses and delegations may be allotted as well.\n\n3) Fund the multisig with .25 eth to cover gas reimbursement for voting, proposal submissions etc.\n\n4) Reimburse .021 eth for expenses setting up the multi-sig, ENS etc.\n\n5) Set out the initial governance document for the Builder Guild. (below)\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkgRhKmS2.jpg)\n\n# Governance of Builder Guild\n\n### Builder Guild Governance Guidelines – First Draft\n\n**MISSION AND VALUES**\n\n**Builder Guild Mission**\nBuilder Guild has been established to provide representation to active DAOs created using Nouns.Build and to support BuilderDAO’s mission: the creation and development of free and accessible DAO infrastructure as a public good.\n\n\n**VOTING**\n\n**Voting Options:**\n\nAll polls in #Builder Guild-votes have the following options: FOR, AGAINST, or a Builder Guildor can abstain from the decision.\n\n**Voting Period:**\n\nAll Builder Guild polls are open for 3 days (72 hours), after which voting will close. Late votes will not be accepted.\n\n**Voting Quorum:** \n\nThe minimum number of Builder Guildors that need to vote on a proposal in order for a decision to be made. Abstains count towards quorum. A vote that fails to meet quorum is null and void. \n\nDefault setting: 10%\n\n\n**MEMBERS**\n\n**Member Eligibility:**\nTo be eligible for membership in Builder Guild an individual must be designated by their DAO as their representative. DAOs will determine this process.\n\n**DAO Eligibility:** \nFor DAOs to nominate a Builder Guild Representative, a DAO must have been created via Nouns.Build, existed for a minimum of 30 days and have a minimum of 30 token holders. \n\n**New Members:**\nNew members can join the Builder Guild Discussion Channel at any time and engage in respectful dialog and discussion. \n\nTo apply to be a voting Builder Guild Representative, fill out the form at: https://www.addressform.io/f/338be41b-d49c-4589-9ba0-4c38bec18cba\n\n\nOnce a Month on or about the 1st of the month, the Builder Guild will vote to add eligible new members. \n\n**Removal of Members:** \nShould it be appropriate to remove a member of the Builder Guild due to behavior unbecoming a Builder Guildor or DAO termination, any 2 members of the Builder Guild can suggest the removal of said member, which will then be put to a binding Builder Guild vote. Removing a Builder Guildlor requires a majority decision (> 51% of Builder Guildors).\n\n**BuilderDAO Proposals:** \nThe Builder Guild shall endeavor to discuss and vote on every proposal made for BuilderDAO. Builder Guild may also submit their own proposals that support the BuilderDAO mission.\n\n\n**Active Builder Guildor**\nA Builder Guildor is considered active who has a vote participation rate  of 30% or greater and has been active in Builder Guild for at least 1 month.\n\n\n**Minimum Vote Participation Rate**\nCurrent Minimum Vote Participation Rate: 30%\n\nIf a Builder Guildor’s vote participation falls below the minimum for two consecutive months, they will be automatically removed from Builder Guild. The DAO may designate a new representative and have them apply. All Builder Guild voting records will start from scratch with a new representative.\n\n**Changes to Builder Guild Governance**\nAny Builder Guild member in good standing may propose a change to this governance document. Changes will be voted on by active Builder Guild members, with a majority vote required to effect change. Onchain vote is not required for Builder Guild governance changes but a current version of the governance document will be maintained and accessbile to all Builder Guild and BuilderDAO members.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy8Ry9mBh.jpg)\n\n\n# **Northstar Check**\n\n## **Builder DAO is dedicated to the creation and development of free and accessible DAO infrastructure as a public good.**\n\nThis proposal furthers that mission by better aligning the DAOs created on Nouns.Build with BuilderDAO by allowing for agency in BuilderDAO via votes on proposals, as well as establishing a team of engaged participants to help further the BuilderDAO mission and create a solid feedback loop.\n\nThis proposal will have minimal impact on the treasury with less than .5 eth dispersed as part of this prop.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1jzQ5mr3.jpg)\n\nTransactions: \nTwo BuilderDAO tokens airdropped to multisig: BuilderGuild.eth   0xa83EDA5030c92E8b835A652B18Ce8888c086A3cf\n\n.25 eth to multisig: BuilderGuild.eth   0xa83EDA5030c92E8b835A652B18Ce8888c086A3cf\n\n.021 eth to Prof Werder thenounishprof.eth for reimbursement of multisig set up and initial funding found here: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x651a765ad6b8199ce999107cefb14145190af63a19b991742fe262afa5d734e4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Establishment of an Operations Working Group",
      "content": "### **Summary:** \nThis proposal requests funding to create an Operations Working Group within Builder DAO. The aim is to improve efficiency and effectiveness in managing administrative tasks such as hiring service providers, tax compliance, expense organization, payables oversight, developing DAO processes, and implementing best practices and documentation standardization.\n\n### **Context:** \nBuilder DAO faces challenges in effectively coordinating and managing administrative tasks, leading to inefficiencies and delays. This proposal intends to address these issues and streamline administrative operations in a smaller group for smoother DAO management and to allow the rest of the DAO to focus on the mission. The DAO’s UNA Structure requires certain administrative tasks to remain compliant. The two UNA administrators will work within this group to execute those tasks.\n\n### **Proposal:**\n\n1. **Formation of an Operations Working Group:** We propose establishing an Operations Working Group, comprising committed DAO members. The primary focus will be on improving administrative efficiency, developing best practices, and providing oversight and guidance for various administrative tasks.\n\n2. **Hiring Service Providers and Tax Compliance:** The Operations Working Group, in conjunction with the UNA Administrators, will be responsible for identifying, hiring, and managing service providers required for operational compliance, such as accountants or legal advisors. They will ensure timely and accurate payment of taxes, and counseling on any potential legal or financial issues.\n \n3. **Expense Organization and Payables Oversight:** The group will develop and implement a system for organizing expenses, tracking invoices, and overseeing payables. This will ensure proper management of financial obligations and improve transparency in financial transactions within the DAO.\n\n4. **Development of DAO Processes and Best Practices:** The Operations Working Group will collaborate with DAO members to develop standardized processes and best practices for various administrative tasks. This includes creating guidelines for onboarding service providers, expense approval workflows, and documentation protocols.\n\n5. **Documentation Standardization:** The group will recommend and establish comprehensive documentation standards and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure consistent practices across the DAO. This will include creating templates, checklists, and guidelines for administrative tasks, facilitating smoother operations and reducing errors.\n\n### **North Star Check:** \nThis proposal aligns with the DAO's mission of creating and developing DAO infrastructure as a public good. By establishing an Operations Working Group, we aim to enhance administrative efficiency, furthering the DAO's mission and vision.\n\n### **Accountability:**\n\n- **Funding:** We estimate 50 ETH will be required from the treasury to support the establishment and functioning of the Operations Working Group. Those funds will be sent to a multi-sig that the Operations group will maintain. Each member of the Operations working group will be a signer and the safe will require approval by 3 of 5 signers.\n- **Term Limits:** While the UNA Administrators will always remain part of the working group we suggest a two year term limit for all members with reauthorization by the DAO every 6 months.\n\n- **Budget Allocation:**\n\n    - Compensation for Working Group Members: 9 ETH, (.5 eth per month per non-admin group member for 6 months with the option to re-up)\n\n    - Expense Organization and Payables Oversight\n\n    - Documentation and SOP Development\n\n    - ETH for gas and other miscellaneous costs\n\n    -  Hiring Service Providers and Tax Compliance:  \n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeif6coprgu3vrte77fcjetdswuupxfl7mmfkjmsxpp6fccm7q2b2ta)\n\n\n### **Timeline:**\n\n- Month 1 (June 2023): Hiring service providers and developing tax compliance procedures, establishing expense organization systems\n- Month 2: Forming the Operations Working Group, defining responsibilities and processes, allocating budgets and resources\n- Month 3: Developing DAO processes and best practices, implementing documentation standards\n- Ongoing: Receiving, summarizing, and implementing advisor guidance \n\n### **Success Metrics:**\n\n- Hiring service and paying service providers no later than June 30th.\n- Ratification of Mission/Vision/Values\n- Develop and document standardized administrative processes for Builder DAO\n\n**Ongoing Updates and Engagement:** We commit to providing regular status updates on the progress of the Operations Working Group and engaging with DAO members to address questions and provide necessary information. Additionally, we commit to providing weekly minutes to the community and holding a monthly meeting where all DAO members can attend and ask questions or participate.\n\n### **Treasury Impact:**\n\n- Total funds requested:  50 eth\n\n- Percentage of treasury funds requested: Approximately 7% of the current treasury holdings\n\n\n### **Transparency:** \n\n**Authors:**  Shaz & Patti\n\nThe authors and beneficiaries of this proposal disclose the following potential ethics disclosures:  \n\nShaz: Current General Counsel for Zora and an Administrator for Builder DAO\n\nProf: Currently compensated by Builder DAO as Community Lead\n\nPatti: Currently a paid consultant for Zora and an Administrator for Builder DAO\n\n**Tax Information:** All members of the working group agree to provide their relevant tax information for any compensation received.\n\n**About the Working Group:**\n\nProf: ⌐◨-◨ Prof Werder (@profwerder, TheNounishProf.eth, kellywerder.eth) BuilderDAO community resident, Nounish builder, Nouncillor and Instructor at Florida Gulf Coast University in the School of Entrepreneurship.

      "title": "Seed Funding for Refraction Creative Grants Community Fund",
      "content": "# Refraction Creative Grants Community Fund \n\n## TLDR \nA regenerative treasury funding creative projects within the Refraction DAO community. \n\n## Proposal\nRefraction DAO is a diverse community of artists, activists, visionaries, and industry leaders who produce festivals and ongoing events, release NFT projects, and create written, visual, and audio content around art, culture, and music today. We’ve hosted flagship events at NFT NYC and Miami Art Week, and worldwide events in Tokyo, Berlin, São Paulo, Toronto, London, Kampala, and Montreal. \n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeic6nnqj5knv23l5vynotanbvt2z3qiaunmau7eithqwkcfngg7viu)\n\nIn 2022, Refraction launched the Creative Grants programme allocating 100k USDC from the DAO treasury to fund projects across the globe, from raves in Kuala Lumpur to internet flea markets in Miami. Applications to the Creative Grants programme were open to anyone, regardless of location or DAO membership, and were selected by Refraction’s curatorial team and a small self-nominated community committee. \n\nThe Community Fund is the next iteration of Refraction’s grants programme, introducing a more regenerative model for Refraction to support projects, and allowing the community to have a bigger stake in decision making. \n\nExtending efforts from the inaugural Creative Grants programme, the Community Fund, powered by the Nouns builder, encourages further cross-collaboration via the funding of a new treasury. Continuing the programme mission of supporting and funding creative projects worldwide, this new funding and organisational structure allows the Refraction community to govern and fund projects in the ecosystem.\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeicqcj4d3vnt6fdsvjsuqxnxtlncia7c67ra3i73ntibxr7gkbycnm) \n\n## BuilderDAO mission alignment\nThe Creative Grants Community Fund is an experimental new use case of the Builder protocol, with the value of the NFTs extending beyond financial and membership benefits. Holders of the auctioned NFTs will be encouraged to propose, vote and support new projects, furthering the reach of the Builder protocol into creative communities around the world. The hope is that this fund will support creative projects in perpetuity, with projects encouraged to kick-back revenue generated using treasury funds. \n\nWe also intend to use the Nouns and Prop House infrastructure throughout the initial fundraising and proposal process, and will encourage funded projects to continue using these protocols during their production process. \n\n\n## Roadmap\n**Fundraising period - April 5th-June 4th, 2023**\nThe Community Fund Nouns contract will deploy on April 5th, and will run for 60 days. NFTs sold using the Nouns builder platform will act as governance tokens during the proposal phase, and the proceeds from the sale will fund the Community Fund treasury. The NFT auction price will start at 0.05 ETH. \n\nArtists and creative producers are encouraged to buy passes, which will allow them to submit proposals and govern the funds raised during the Proposal period. Silent stakeholders are also welcomed to buy passes during this time, allowing them to vote in the eventual governance process without requirement to generate proposals. \n\n**Proposal period - June 5th-25th, 2023**\nThe proposal period will last for 3 weeks following the final auction. Artists or communities holding Community Fund NFTs are welcome to raise proposals to the group of passholders. Proposals will be submitted via Prop House, to ensure that funds are distributed equitably. Proposals cannot be raised for more than 50% of the overall treasury, and must be submitted by a Community Fund NFT holder to be ratified. \n\nRefraction’s Curatorial team will steward this proposal and governance process, holding weekly calls for proposal ideation and discussion. Artists will be encouraged to think about the longevity of this fund, considering projects that will further fund the treasury with NFT or ticket sales. \n\n**Voting period - June 26-July 2nd, 2023**\nAt the end of the proposal period, a vote will be held over the course of 7-days to allocate treasury funds to proposed projects. \n\n**Production period - July 3rd-August 31st, 2023**\nIn the following 2 months, successfully funded projects will commence production with the intention to complete projects within the production period. \n\n\n## Allocation breakdown\nRefraction will support this activity by providing 4 microgrants of up to $1k USDC each, to artist communities who participated in the inaugural Creative Grants programme, to assist in the purchasing of passes and promotion of the Fund within grantee communities. Refraction will also send $1k USDC to the Community Fund treasury upon deployment to seed the fund. \n\nRefraction is proposing support from the BuilderDAO community, requesting **10 ETH** to further seed the Community Fund treasury.\n\n\n## Accountability\nRefraction will steward the Fund through the initial fundraising, proposal and production process, gathering project updates and milestones to share publicly and with the BuilderDAO community. Twitter Spaces, Discord Town Halls and Refraction editorial support will assist in this communication. \n\nIf successful, the requested BuilderDAO funds will be used to directly support creative projects within the Refraction ecosystem, with production on all projects completed by the end of 2023. A report on the first phase of the Fund will be published in early 2024, highlighting projects, artists, communities, and the future of the Fund. \n\n\n## Transparency\nRefraction has previously partnered with Zora on various projects, using Zora tools to power Refraction’s creative projects and drops. We’re currently asking for support from the Builder community to help bring the Builder protocol and this grant funding structure to an extended network of creatives both in and outside of Refraction’s existing membership. \n\n## Relevant links\n**Refraction DAO + selected press**\nhttps://www.refractionfestival.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/RefractionDAO\nhttps://www.instagram.com/refractionfestival/\nhttp://officemagazine.net/refraction-future-festivals\nhttps://zine.zora.co/refraction-malcolm-levy-refract-pass\n\n\n**Creative Grants + selected press**\nhttps://www.refractionfestival.com/editorial/s02-s03-creative-grants\nhttps://www.refractionfestival.com/editorial/meet-the-refraction-season-02-grant-recipients\nhttps://www.refractionfestival.com/editorial/world-view-the-global-reach-of-refraction-s02-03-grant-recipients\nhttps://xlr8r.com/features/web3-weekly-wrap-water-musics-music-and-the-metaverse-playbook-refractions-creative-grants-program-vic-mensa-and-keyon-christ-and-more/\nhttps://pickuptheflow.org/2022/07/09/creative-grants-refraction/\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeigmwoyjt4kxszzlyljaqoosmelxecrg2ot55wvmebbhepso4n45ou)",

      "title": "Builder DAO Hosted By Fridays at The Park at FWB Fest 2023",
      "content": "\n**Summary**\n\nThe Park intends to collaborate with Builder to create onchain artifacts and content highlighting the incredible humans and missions behind Builder DAOs. To that end, we will film a series of conversations amongst prominent creators in the builder community to help make the value of Builder legible to the wider Web3 community attending [FWB Fest](https://fest.fwb.help). These sessions will yield two assets; a video of the creative process & surrounding conversations as well as a song written by the creatives in attendance. Both of these will be minted onchain via droposal with a split of resulting revenue between The Park & Builder DAO & FWB\n\n  \n\n**Context**\n\nThere is a deficit of content promoting Builder DAO & the works of partner DAOs. Fridays at The Park has been effectively demonstrating the utility of the Builder format to create weekly songs, conversations, videos and artifacts onchain. This has yielded a great community vibe that provides context and education around the Nouns Builder tool. We’ve been minting weekly outputs onchain from our Builder DAO and are a highly visible music community actively utilizing the Builder tool. We have experience cultivating large events and generating meaningful conversations and moments that effectively onboard creatives into the Builder ecosystem.\n\n![enter image description here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1109196305848344739/1109196535939465346/TOBi.gif)\n\nTo watch full videos of minted episodes, see links below:\n\n1.

      "title": "Proposal to Revoke and Reassign Administrative Authorizations",
      "content": "### Summary\n\nThis proposal revokes administrative authorizations granted under [Proposal 25](https://nouns.build/dao/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/0x6f007cc9c5f4f2fc0ad6411f19ffadd3d4dac7be1f6446ef140a354192df6716) to obtain or provide legal, tax, and other services for or to the DAO from certain prior administrators. reassigns the authorizations to new administrators, and adds new authorization for certain information collection activities. \n\n\n### Issue\n\n[Proposal 25](https://nouns.build/dao/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/0x6f007cc9c5f4f2fc0ad6411f19ffadd3d4dac7be1f6446ef140a354192df6716) granted David Kerr, Kyler Wandler, and Zora limited administrative authorization to research and recommend legal and tax service providers to address the DAO’s compliance needs, and to enact necessary steps to formalize the UNA. The need for this authorization arose due to the DAO’s acceptance and distribution of funds, which create tax and informational reporting obligations for the DAO.\n\nDavid and Kyler have communicated their desire to resign from their roles as administrators. Replacement administrators are needed to take on their responsibilities and to help the DAO meet its information collection obligations. \n\n**Context & Work Completed**\n\n[Proposal 25](https://nouns.build/dao/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/0x6f007cc9c5f4f2fc0ad6411f19ffadd3d4dac7be1f6446ef140a354192df6716) was approved by the DAO on January 23, 2023. Since then, the administrators have analyzed the DAOs operational needs, spoken with and vetted potential service providers to address those needs, and provided updates on their efforts as described in [this Discourse update](https://forum.nouns.build/t/prop-25-update-and-compliance-game-plan/41). \n\nDavid and Kyler had also taken the following steps to finalize the establishment of the UNA in Wyoming:\n\n1. Attained an EIN \n2. Attained a registered agent for service of process in Wyoming \n3. Acted as contacts for the DAO for service of process.  \n4. Submitted an election to be taxed as a corporation (Form 8832)\n5. Obtained a contact phone number, email, and local Wyoming address (via a virtual office lease) as required for local registration\n\nA few steps, noted in detail below, remain outstanding. \n\n### Proposal\n\n_1) Revoke prior administrative authorization granted to: a) David Kerr to engage legal and tax advisors for the DAO; and b) David Kerr and Kyler Wandler to take necessary steps to finalize the establishment of the UNA in Wyoming and allow it to perform its core compliance and reporting functions._\n\nUpon this revocation, David and Kyler will no longer be authorized to act on behalf of the DAO except solely to facilitate the transition of their administrator responsibilities to the new administrators identified below. \n\n_2) Authorize Zora, via a representative employee of its choosing (the “Zora Administrator) and Patti Hauseman as administrators_ _to continue engaging legal and tax advisors for the DAO_\n\nUnder this authorization, the Zora administrator and Patti are authorized to take the following actions on behalf of the DAO:\n\n- Recommend legal and tax service providers (including outside counsel, tax preparers, and bookkeepers) to the DAO and, following the DAO’s approval of service provider compensation via proposal vote, enter into engagement letters with such service providers.\n- Engage in confidential discussions with legal and tax service providers to obtain guidance regarding key compliance issues impacting the DAO, including required information collection and reporting. \n- Make administrative decisions regarding the form of guidance to be provided (e.g. determining work product format, frequency of calls, agendas for meetings)\n- Review and summarize all material guidance for other DAO members and propose strategies to achieve legal and tax compliance goals.\n- Prepare the DAO to receive certain Builder Protocol IP from Zora\n- Execute required filings and reports, including to sign, file, and pay taxes\n- Propose a framework for an Operations Working Group to ultimately take on the above responsibilities and the underlying engagement and payment of service providers.\n\nCommitment - This is intended to be a limited commitment. Authorization will last until these responsibilities are delegated to a working group or committee by proposal vote, the DAO removes the authorization, an administrator’s authorization expires, or the administrator resigns.\n\n_3) Authorize_ _the Zora Administrator and Patti Hauseman_ _to take necessary steps to finalize the establishment of the UNA in Wyoming and allow it to perform its core compliance and reporting functions._\n\nUnder this authorization, the Zora administrator and Patti are authorized to take, or sign documentation allowing the DAO to take, the following actions on behalf of the DAO:\n\n- File service of process with the Secretary of State of Wyoming\n- Attain a service provider capable of remitting tax payments\n- Take any other action to maintain the UNA in good standing\n- Zora to make de minimis payments (i.e. less than $500) solely in furtherance of these listed goals, and shall not seek reimbursement from the DAO for these costs. \n\nCommitment\n\n- **Contact for Registered Agent and UNA Maintenance** - These are intended to be ongoing commitments. Authorization will last until the DAO removes the authorization, an administrator’s authorization expires, or the administrator resigns.\n- **Other Authorizations** - These are intended to be limited commitments. The authorization will end as soon as the tasks required to accomplish these listed goals above are completed.\n\n_4) Authorize the Zora representative as administrator_ _to manually collect and store information required for tax reporting purposes from recipients of BuilderDAO funds._ \n\nAs described in detail [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1042889124983623730/1061036058344702002/Builder_DAO_-_Taxes_and_Information_Collection_FAQ.pdf), BuilderDAO is required to collect certain information from service providers it pays and report that information to the IRS to help ensure the service providers pay their share in taxes. If the DAO fails to do this, the DAO may be required to pay the service provider’s taxes itself, and may also be subject to penalties. This would result in more Treasury funds being spent on taxes rather than in furtherance of the DAO’s mission. \n\nUnder this authorization, the Zora representative is authorized to manually reach out to DAO funds recipients to collect and store the necessary information to allow the DAO to meet its obligations and issue 1099 forms to funds recipients. Access to this information shall be limited only to Zora personnel necessary to meet the DAO’s tax reporting obligations. Once the DAO approves and onboards a service provider to handle the information collection and reporting process, Zora shall transfer all of the collected information to the service provider. \n\nCommitment - This is intended to be a limited commitment. Authorization will end once a service provider is onboarded to take over this responsibility and the information has been transferred. The authorization may also end if the DAO removes the authorization or the administrator resigns.\n\n### North Star Check\n\nThis proposal supports the DAO’s mission by ensuring the DAO has the appropriate operational and administrative infrastructure to operate safely and compliantly in furtherance of the mission as a nonprofit enterprise supporting public good DAO infrastructure. \n\n### Compensation/Treasury Impact\n\nZora shall provide services under this proposal without compensation.\n\nWhile this role generally deserves compensation due to the administrator's scope of responsibilities and the sensitivity of the work, Patti agrees to waive compensation for the time being in order to limit impact on the DAO’s treasury.\n\n### Disclosures\n\nThe Zora Representative will be an active US-based employee of Zora Labs.\n\nPatti provides consulting services to Zora under a short term contract. She is also the former Operations Lead at FWB tasked with oversight of people ops, compliance, legal, treasury, and general operations\n  \n",

(Specific attendees will be confirmed once this proposal is passed. Discussions underway.)\n\nIn addition, Nouns Builder branded bags, pens and stickers will be distributed to the attendees. A sample was already created and is ready for order. It includes the Builder noggles and website. 1 eth will be budgeted for merch, with any extra items made available to BuilderDAO members. Total will be for items plus shipping. We'll also create a BuilderDAO branded POAP to distribute.  \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ-7oJ5E2.jpg)\n\n\nRemaining funds will help defer travel costs for the panelists for hotel and airfare.\n\n\n---\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/C0KGnpU.jpg)\n\n\n### Northstar Check\n\n## **Builder DAO is dedicated to the creation and development of free and accessible DAO infrastructure as a public good.**\n\nSponsoring a conference for Farcaster - also building as a public good - allows us an opportunity to get in front of some of the best builders in web3. The timing of this conference should align as a promotion opportunity for BuilderDAO's planned hack week and other initiatives. In addition, the content created and shared from the event provides an additional opportunity to proliferate Nouns Builder via social media. The funding request of 4 eth will have minimal impact on the treasury. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4gFM52Z.png)\n\n---\n\n\n\nFunding request: \n1 eth to Farcon.eth: 0x8f7387F58746C2993f08D6846F74B7542F6469De\n\n3 eth to BuilderDAO.thenounishprof.eth\n0xF83426084B93adCA5A3c8630032e007038823b4d\nto be distributed as follows: 1 eth for bags/merch for Farcon attendees; 2 eth to be split among panel participants to assist with travel expenses\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Builder Utils - Enhancing the Developer Experience in the Builder Ecosystem",
      "content": "### Abstract\n\nAllocate 5 ETH towards the continued development of [dao-utils](https://github.com/public-assembly/dao-utils), the underlying package that handles data fetching and contract interaction scaffolding for [Flexible](https://github.com/public-assembly/flexible) by Public Assembly, among other projects.\n\n### Context\n\nA working group from Public Assembly set out to build Flexible, a customizable template that allows any DAO created via Nouns Builder to create their own unique website. The release of Flexible sets the stage for DAOs to experiment in their own domain, outside the confines of a one size fits all interface. \n\nHowever, Flexible wasn’t designed with a developer first experience. And since its inception, the the landscape has changed, Nouns Builder is open source, and the fruit of a myriad of great proposals has landed in the Builder ecosystem. To continue innovating on the application layer, it is necessary to refocus on the underlying architecture. This applies not only to Flexible, but also to a variety of other applications and specified clients that are bound to emerge in the ecosystem.\n\n### Description\n\nBuilder Utils is a commitment to a developer first experience that aims to address the repeatedly vocalized needs of the Builder community. For instance, even seemingly low-hanging fruit like integrating a custom auction component hasn’t received the attention it deserves due to overly opinionated existing solutions or high-level documentation. Similarly, complex logic such as managing a proposal throughout its lifecycle should exist as reusable logic.\n\nBy taking a documentation driven development approach and borrowing some of the great patterns exposed via the Nouns Builder codebase, Builder Utils aims to develop a more developer-friendly experience that addresses the needs of the Builder community. This approach will allow for more surface area for nontechnical contributors, further cohesion among existing engineering efforts, and intuitive ways for contributors and prop house winners to get up and running within the ecosystem.\n\n*This proposal was brought to you by [Salief Lewis](https://twitter.com/salieflewis). A core contributor at Public Assembly, and a maintainer of both dao-utils and Flexible.*",

      "content": "# Community Resident (3mo. extension)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/SO6Kkoy.jpg)\n\n## **This proposal is for continuation of the BuilderDAO Community Resident (Prof Werder) for April, May and June 2023.**\n\n**BuilderDAO is at a critical juncture. We have a fractured community that has been through some challenges. BUT the potential is enormous. Looking ahead, in addition to maintenance of the discord, Town Halls, and Twitter Spaces, I'll be focusing on the following:**\n\n\n\n\n* Oversee the implementation of Roko into BuilderDAO discord with NounsAI to add FAQ support and summaries. I am working with Steve and Alx on this as part of their beta test so we will also be supplying feedback.\n* Launch Builder Nouncil (or name TBD) and get them on a path to assist with feedback, communication to Nounish DAOs and governance of BuilderDAO.\n* Work on utilizing BuilderBox content better via edited clips for social media and podcast content. And use this platform and others to highlight Nounish DAOs.\n* Assist other core contributors with a BuilderDAO Hack Week and/or infinite rounds prop house. This is currently under development and will need support and promotion for success.\n* Add Prop Lot as an idea generation temp check and location outside discord for discussions as another decentralized touchpoint.\n* Design a DAO Incubator for nounish DAOs with the input of Builder Nouncil Reps.\n* Work with BuilderDAO members to determine if a Small Grants team is warranted and if so, to assist in implementing that.\n* Seek out opportunities to showcase Nouns Builder at IRL events (e.g. Farcon - in talks now)\n* As Zora implements a new support system for Nouns Builder, ensure a smooth transition and that any gaps are filled.\n* Assist with designs for a Community Tools website.\n* Review previously funded props and ping for updates if needed.\n\n\n---\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/C0KGnpU.jpg)\n\n**These goals align with what I've already accomplished during April which included:**\n\n\n\n* Management of the Builder Community discord, including implementation of a support ticket system, management and recording of town halls, creating channels for prop discussions and idea generation, and fostering DAO conversations.\n* Organizing and attending the BuilderDAO NYC [Bagels & Builders meetup](https://nouns.build/dao/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/0x03a68398cb32caf742173dba68cce849fb18cfc6e2d5891656c804636fa2d397). This event was also recorded for BuilderBox twitter spaces. It was great gathering and hope to assist with more. (see pix here: https://twitter.com/ProfWerder/status/1647547986216353792?s=20I ) also discussed Nouns Builder and BuilderDAO with numerous people during my time at NFT.NYC.\n* Weekly BuilderBox Twitter Spaces covering the activities of Nounish DAOs, BuilderDAO props and interviews with interesting and helpful experts, providing the only consistent outreach.\n* Added and will be building @BuilderBoxShow on Twitter for additional reach.\n* Working with Adel from Lil Nouns to implement Prop Lot into BuilderDAO as an idea generation tool and temp check. This will also eliminate duplicate discussion channels in discord.\n* Working with NounsAI team (Steve in particular) on implementing Roko for FAQ's about Nouns and working towards training on Nouns Builder questions as well. We will be in beta on this for a bit but this will help alleviate some of the workload on both me and the support team. We also tried Roko for town hall recording but voice recording is not going to be supported moving forward so we will continue with Craig.\n* Establishing a Builder Nouncil and seeking one representative from each active DAO launched via Nouns.Build to increase communication between BuilderDAO and the DAOs built on Nouns Builder. I will also be delegating one of my tokens to this council. This will be the initial launch and we'll accept applications through April 30 and the first monthly voice chat on Thursday May 4 at 4 pm eastern (before BuilderDAO town hall). Created an AddressForm to facilitate the first round of Nouncil members: https://www.addressform.io/f/84a227b3-8994-46cd-a458-5652ae95f362 \n* Working with JoelCares to implement Nermanbot for Builder Nouncil Voting. Again, this is a bit of a beta test since it will be one of the early implementations outside Nouns Nouncil. Also acquired BuilderNouncil.eth which can be used for token delegation if desired.\n* Bought and directed BuilderDAO's auction page to: BuilderDAOAuction.wtf \n* Assisted and answered questions for multiple people with ideas around DAOs. Hoping a DAO incubator can help with this as well.\n* Numerous dm's and discussions around how to move forward in a positive direction, including working on communication, tone, etc among members. \n* Met with Patti Hausmann, a consultant brought in by Zora to assist with future direction and will be meeting with her weekly. Initial discussions are around community building and communication.\n* Proposed and passed the [Prop House Reset prop](https://nouns.build/dao/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/0xf1a4dc701c52fc5ce4dc4923c2a57d2e7f483066097e1a800ccac9eeb54ccecf).\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Although we have had quite a few challenges, I am still passionate about BuilderDAO's mission, which is prominent in the about section at [BuilderDAOauction.wtf](https://nouns.build/dao/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/163?tab=about):\n\n## **Builder DAO is dedicated to the creation and development of free and accessible DAO infrastructure as a public good.**\n\n\n###### \n### If we keep this as a north star moving forward, I believe we still have an opportunity for big impact.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/4gFM52Z.png)\n\n---\n\n\n\nFunding request: 6 eth for the community resident for the three month period of April -- June.\n**Transaction: **\n6 eth to: theNounishProf.eth: 0xCEEd9585854F12F81A0103861b83b995A64AD915\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Alphacaster.xyz Retroactive Funding",
      "content": "*Submitter's note: The Alphacaster team are not members of BuilderDAO (yet), so I am submitting their proposal on their behalf. Alphacaster is the primary way I keep up and participate in Governance across the BuilderDAO ecosystem and I'm honored to submit this prop for them.*\n\n### TLDR\nAlphacaster is a Farcaster-based Nounish social client. Launched in early Feb, it has supported 11 Nounish DAOs and won a Nouns Hack Week Award. It is requesting 9 ETH and a Builder token as retroactive funding. Visit [Alphacaster.xyz](https://www.alphacaster.xyz/feed/nouns) to try it out (also available on mobile for beta testers)\n\n### Introduction\n\nDAO is an inherently social experience. However, most Nounish DAO conversations today are still happening within walled gardens such as Twitter and Discord. We are still renting communication infra from web2 companies who would not hesitate to cut off API access and enrich their bottom line at the expense of our beloved communities.\n\nWe believe in ownership and full-stack DAO sovereignty. Now that we have Builder smart contracts to govern how we spend treasury, it’s time to take back our social layer.\n\nThis is why we are building Alphacaster, a Farcaster-based Nounish client that combines governance with web3 social.\n\n### Alphacaster\n\nLaunched on February 2, 2023, Alphacaster provides a platform for DAO members to vote, debate and socialize on top of an open social protocol (Farcaster). It is now available on Web, iOS TestFlight and Android (via APK).\n\nAmong other things, Alphacaster currently gives you\n\n- DAO-only Farcaster social feeds with governance & auction updates\n- Real-time push notification for governance & auctions\n- Native display of vote reasons with links to voters' Farcaster profiles\n- Decentralized Proposal Comments that aggregate discussions on Farcaster\n \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/xoqQjTw.png)\n\nIn additional, using Farcaster enables DAO members to post from any client and still have the entire global state accessible to every developer. No one can turn off the “API”.\n\nWe currently support 11 Nounish DAOs (e.g. Nouns, Builder DAO, Purple, the park) and are constantly adding new ones. Alphacaster has also become the default way to share Nounish proposals on Farcaster.\n\nWe have received some Nounish Twitter mentions (including a [retweet](https://twitter.com/ccarella/status/1636071687295778817) from @nounsdao) and recently won [Nouns Hack Week](https://prop.house/nouns/hack-week-developers-developers-developers) (finished #4 in the Developer track for our work on the mobile app)\n\n### Team\n\nThere are two people behind Alphacaster. Both are developers.\n\n- billzh.eth (i.e. myself, [@billzh](https://warpcast.com/billzh) on Farcaster)\n- andand.eth ([@16](https://warpcast.com/16) on Farcaster)\n\n\n### Future plan\n\nWhile this proposal focuses our work in the past, we do have exciting plans for the future. For example:\n\n- Expand integration with Nounish DAOs (and others, such as FWB or Forefront, when timing is right)\n- Develop curated DAO feed, commentable vote reasons & a seamless governance experience for multi-DAO participants\n- Better integration with Farcaster, including a Farcaster profile displaying DAO badges & participation history \n\n### Our ask\n\nOur team is entirely bootstrapped and have received no outside funding other than 3 ETH reward from Nouns Hack Week.\n\nWe are requesting a retroactive grant of the following\n\n- 7 ETH as retroactive funding for the engineering work in the past 3 months\n- 2 ETH as funding for ongoing maintenance of current features \n- 1 Builder DAO token to billzh.eth (i.e. myself) so that I can officially become a DAO member\n\n\nThis adds up to 9 ETH plus a builder token, which will allow us to stay independent and continue our mission of developing a self-sovereign social layer for the Nounish community and beyond.\n\nWe look forward to your feedback and are happy to provide any additional information that may help you make a decision.\n\n### Appendix: Transaction information\n\nTransfer 9 ETH to billzh.eth (0xD1EAeFBeFFD4106A1A166CD26a1Fe23140D6a42e)\n\nAirdrop 1 Builder DAO token to billzh.eth (0xD1EAeFBeFFD4106A1A166CD26a1Fe23140D6a42e)\n\n",

      "content": "### TL;DR\nFund BotFrens **18E** to add key new features to the Builder and Nouns DAO bots that make it easier to engage the community through timely calls-to-action and stay informed on DAO activity as it happens.\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeiacy6ee5tstgzu2i3p6rkubpmuiz2hh2qjtfquadxnba2twguazuq)\n\n### About\n[BotFrens](https://botfrens.com) makes it easy for DAOs to publish auctions, votes, sales, and other events to Discord, Farcaster, and Twitter. With 500+ dev hours, BotFrens has integrated Builder contracts and launched bots for DAOs such as [Builder](https://twitter.com/builder_dao_bot), [Purple](https://warpcast.com/purplebot), [Toadz](https://twitter.com/TOADDAOWTF), [XNouns](https://twitter.com/XNouns_), [BLVKHVND](https://twitter.com/blvkhvnd_bot), and many others.\n\nSince the launch, we’ve been gathering feature suggestions from the Builder community (see below 👇. This proposal seeks funding to implement those features.\n\n### Key Points\nWe are NOT asking for retro funding! We have spent over 500 dev hours integrating Builder because of our commitment to this project. This proposal seeks funding for **NEW** features suggested by the Builder / Nouns communities.\n\n- **Why?** Our goal is to surface interesting data through fully-automated and configurable bot behaviors and increase engagement around auctions and proposals.\n\n- **Who benefits?** All existing and future Builder and [Nounish DAOs](https://twitter.com/nouns_bot).\n\n- **Cost:** 18Ξ (~230 developer hours + init infa setup + QA + support)\n\n- **Timeline:** The entire project will take around 6 weeks to complete, but users will be able to use new behaviors as soon as they are available. \n\n- **Team’s credibility:** We have a solid track record working with [Nouns DAO](https://nouns.wtf/vote/144), [Purple DAO](https://nouns.build/dao/0xa45662638e9f3bbb7a6fecb4b17853b7ba0f3a60/vote/0xd621637cac452368ba232a2447d018ffdc7eaefddd2431c8bad5a87fdb5c69bc), [Rarible DAO](https://daotimes.com/rarible-dao-to-launch-a-twitter-bot-that-displays-real-time-marketplace-info/), [Foundation marketplace](https://twitter.com/foundation_bot) and other key web3 projects. Our work is featured in [WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/why-twitter-perfect-artists-portfolio/), [Observer](https://observer.com/2021/08/social-media-art-bots-twitter/), and [Hyperallergic](https://hyperallergic.com/799103/twitter-api-beloved-art-bots/), to name a few. We are here for the long term and our incentives are aligned with Builder’s success.\n\n- **Path to sustainability:** BotFrens is a bootstrapped startup and our customers cover the cost of running their bots by paying ~ 0.015Ξ /month. This model puts BotFrens on a path to sustainability and incentivizes us to do the best possible work.\n\n### ✨🤖 New Bot Features 🤘🌈\n\n\n### Call-to-Action Reminders for Auctions / Voting\nIncrease engagement by sharing timely reminders about ending auctions and proposal voting periods.\n\n**Post Examples**\n```\nFor proposals: Voting closes in 3 hours. Please vote!\nFor auctions: The auction ends in 15 minutes. Place your bid now.  \n```\n\n**Template Config ✏️**\n```\nPeriods: 1 day, 1 hour, 20 minutes, 10 minutes\nTemplate variables time_remaining\nFor auctions: token_id\nFor proposals: proposal_id\n```\n\n### DAO Snapshot Summary\nProvide a snapshot of the current state of the DAO. This behavior runs on a user-defined schedule.\n\n**Post Example**\n```\nBuilder DAO Snapshot\n\nTotal Members: 123\nVoted within 30 days: 34\nTotal tokens: 435\nTreasury: 589E ($1,058,402.59)\nLatest auction: 0.363E\nActive Proposals: 3\n```\n\n**Template Config ✏️**\n```\nTemplate variables: total_members, active_members,, token_count, treasury, treaury_usd, last_token_price\n```\n\n### New: Daily / Weekly / Monthly Membership Summary\nWelcome new users into the DAO. This behavior runs on a user-defined schedule.\n\n**Post Example**\n```\n4 users joined the Builder DAO this week. Please join me in welcoming \n\naddress.eth\n@twitterhandle\n0x2322...23\n0x3434..123\n\n[ATTACH TOKEN IMG] [ATTACH TOKEN IMG] [ATTACH TOKEN IMG] \n```\n**Template Config ✏️**\n```\nAttach_image, members_count, members_list\n```\n\n### Auction Settled - Context Follow up\nProvide additional context on the latest DAO auction and who won it. This behavior runs automatically every time an auction is settled.\n\n**Post Example - New Members**\n```\nWe have a new DAO member! Welcome to the fam, newmember.eth. Here are some helpful links to get you started:\n\nDiscord Link \nCharmverse Link\nFarcaster Link\n```\n**Post Example - Existing Members**\n```\nExisting member: existingmember.eth snagged another token. In addition to token 123, they also hold tokens 345, 567, 891.\n[ATTACH TOKEN IMG] [ATTACH TOKEN IMG] [ATTACH TOKEN IMG] \n```\n\n**Template Config ✏️**\n```\nattach_image, token_id, existing_tokens, wallet\n```\n\n### Treasury Activity\nReal-time posts triggered by treasury deposits and withdrawals. This behavior runs automatically based on treasury activity.\n\n**Post Examples**\n```\n16E was transferred from the Builder DAO treasury to thenounishprof.eth \n0.44E was just deposited into the Builder DAO treasury! The total treasury is 589E\n```\n\n**Template Config ✏️**\n```\nFor deposits: amount, treasury_total\nFor withdrawals: amount, wallet, treasury_total\n```\n\n### Treasury Snapshot\nA summary of the weekly / monthly state of the treasury. This behavior runs on a user-defined schedule.\n\n**Post Example**\n```\nIn the last month, the Builder DAO treasury decreased by 10% or 100E\nDeposits from Auctions: 45E\nWithdrawals: 55E\nTotal: 1223E\n```\n**Template Config ✏️**\n```\nTemplate variables: deposits_total, widthdrawls_total, treasury_total, direction, percent_difference, total_difference\n```\n\n### Active Proposal Vote Summary \nShare a vote count for every active proposal. This behavior runs automatically every 3 votes.\n\n**Post Example**\n```\nFor: 14 (60%) \nAgainst: 9 (40%)\nAbstain: 0 (0%)\n```\n**Template Config ✏️**\n```\nVariables: for_count, for_percent, against_count, against_percent, abstain_count, abstain_percent, attach_image\n```\n\n### Active Proposal Threshold Reached\nA notification when a threshold has been reached. Runs automatically.\n\n**Post Example**\n```\nThe voting threshold of 15 votes has been crossed!\n```\n**Template Config ✏️**\n```\nVariables: threshold\n```\n\n### Improvement: Vote Reasons as Image\nUsers have expressed the desire to display vote reasons as images. This makes it easier to share / repost them. We are aware that [Nokry](https://twitter.com/neokry_) is working on something similar for the Builder and we will probably collaborate on a generic image service. \n\n**Post Example - Not the final design**\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeig4lic47ek7pkutlf6ecfv53iev6nxyaomgjsuin2eenwmd7tq7fy)\n\n**Template Config ✏️**\n```\nVariables: attach_image\n```\n\n### Improvement: Vote Reasons in Template\nRight now vote reasons are attached automatically and we’d love to give users an option of how to configure them.\n\n**Post Example**\n```\nBotfrens.eth voted FOR prop 123\nReason: Love this prop\n```\n\n**Template Config ✏️**\n```\nVariable: reason\n```\n\n### Improvement: Vote Formatting\nUpdate YES / NO to FOR / AGAINST\n\n**Post Example**\n\n```\nandreitr.eth voted AGAINST with 5 votes\nbotfrens.eth voted FOR with 2 votes \njacob.eth voted ABSTAIN with 1 vote\n```\n-----\nHuge thanks to the Builder DAO and the Nouns DAO community members for suggesting new features and providing feedback on this proposal.

Zora has also refused to address rather significant concerns of BuilderDAO members.\n\nMore details on this proposal will be airdropped to all Builder and Noun holders and an OE will also be freely available to anyone interested during the voting period.\n",

      "content": "I am are writing this proposal to address some concerns members have regarding the governance and decision-making processes within Builder DAO. This proposal aims to ensure greater transparency and fairness in decision-making, which I believe is essential for the long-term success of the DAO and its mission.\n\nThe proposal includes the following points:\n\nRemove Zora's veto power: zora.eth (Zora Inc) currently holds a veto power that can prevent any proposal from passing. This creates a significant imbalance of power and undermines the democratic process of a DAO. Removing this veto power will ensure that all proposals are subject to the same scrutiny and decision-making process, without any undue influence from a single entity.\nBuilderDAO was presented to Nouns without fully disclosing the nature of the project they intended to undertake. It was not made clear that the project would involve the creation of an UNA, let alone one founded by a US entity.\n\nIncrease NounsDAO allocation to 10%: Currently, NounsDAO holds a 5% allocation of BuilderDAO tokens. This allocation should be increased to 10%, reflecting the important role that the DAO plays in the builder ecosystem and ensuring that it has sufficient means to carry out its mission.\n\nRemove Zora's founder allocation: Currently, Zora holds a founder allocation of 10%. Given the potential conflicts of interest associated with the company's involvement in the DAO, this allocation should be removed to prevent any further conflicts of interest.\n\nIncrease the auction minimum bid to 3 ETH: There have been several instances where malicious actors have targeted BuilderDAOs with low minimum bid requirements, leading to the loss of funds for DAO members. Increasing the auction minimum bid to 3 ETH will mitigate this risk and provide greater security for BuilderDAO members, especially considering the current size of the treasury.\n\nThese changes will increase transparency within the Builder and greater Nouns ecosystem and help to ensure that it operates in the best interests of its members. \nI urge all members of the DAO to support this proposal and help to strengthen **the integrity of our community.**",

Our 129 members, many of whom are experiencing a Nounish DAO for the first time, serve as a vital connection to the wider Ethereum community. Our membership includes leaders in organizations such as Nouns DAO, Coinbase, FWB, OrangeDAO, Bright Moments, Worldcoin and startups participating in a16z startup school and the Alliance DAO Web3 Accelerator.\n\nAs active participants in the Nounish ecosystem, Purple is dedicated to utilizing a wide range of Nounish tools, such as Prop House, BotFrens, House of Nouns, Builder iOS Widgets, and Nouns AI Playground. Our continuous efforts to expand the toolkit and build a bridge to Ethereum communities have led us to become the first Nounish DAO to acquire a BuilderDAO token, use Juicebox in a Proposal, and develop future plans to implement Quadratic Public Goods funding via Gitcoin's Allo Protocol. These achievements have opened doors to engaging in private and public discussions with over a dozen prominent protocols and organizations, exploring the potential benefits of having a Nounish DAO support their protocol.\n\nThis proposal seeks 50 ETH to bolster our efforts in financing Public Goods, exemplifying a successful Nounish DAO, and furthering BuilderDAO's most potent proliferation strategy. Following the deployment of our initial 25 ETH, momentum from ETH Denver and the maturation of the Farcaster protocol, I evaluated the impact of our initial investment and the opportunities ahead. Consequently, I determined that an additional 50 ETH is necessary to capitalize on the potential to fund Public Goods and maximize the proliferation of Nouns Builder.\n\nAdditionally, a vote in favor of this proposal demonstrates to the world that when you establish a DAO using Nouns Builder and invest the necessary initial effort to cultivate a thriving DAO, BuilderDAO will provide its unwavering support.\n\n## Proof of Proliferation: An Incomplete List of Media Mentions & Features\n\n### Podcasts / Twitter Spaces / ETC\n\n- [Jacob talks about Purple on SeedClub's Building at the Edges](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3ab3dda3-4fb5-42a5-8aee-a6e6b094c818)\n\n- [Jahid discusses Purple on the UFO Podcast with Nick Hollins](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cf5f8945-24c8-4aa8-864a-fc34843846d3)\n\n- [Yuri mentions Purple as inspiring on UFO Podcast with Nick Hollins](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3DiwwDLRh9SFz31nMEv9KJ?si=fe7bb44dca3247aa) \n\n- [Purple Radio on The Noun Square every 3rd Friday](https://twitter.com/thenounsquare/status/1623775626040602627?s=20)\n\n- [Chris Carella discusses Purple on Unlonely](https://www.unlonely.app/)\n\n- [Chris Carella discussing Purple on Where's the Block Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3vmsZxJz9I90NSLcKeRI7O?si=unRI4ag-R66g4CUUMVMIdA)\n\n- [Chris Carella discussing Purple and Nouns Builder on Juicecast Podcast by Juicebox (next Episode to be released)](https://open.spotify.com/show/4G8ji7vofcOx2acXcjXIa4)\n\n- [Purple Members discussing Purple and Nouns Builder on Web3Galaxy Brain Podcast (next episode to be released)](https://web3galaxybrain.com/)\n\n- [Chris Carella on the BuilderDAO Streams EP2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3mHeEfqJl0)\n\n- [Purple with ccarella on Lil Panda's Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOqpnlIIxs8)\n\n- Dan Romero discusses Purple on Noun O'Clock.\n\n- Dan Romero discusses Purple on the Farcaster Broadcast on ClubHouse (4.6.23)\n\n-  Chris Carella on upcoming Noun O'Clock on April (4.11.23)\n\n### Blog Posts and Newsletters\n\n- [Now Anyone Can Create an Ethereum NFT DAO With Zora’s Nouns Builder (Decrypt)](https://decrypt.co/113225/now-anyone-can-create-ethereum-nft-dao-zora-nouns-builder)\n\n- [Why I Joined Purple (Phil Mohun of BrightMoments)](https://www.philmohun.com/why-i-joined-purple/)\n\n- [Forefront Newsletter (11.7.22)](https://mailchi.mp/forefront/issue-113?e=ff253ea0bd)\n\n- [Forefront Newsletter (1.9.23)](https://mailchi.mp/forefront/issue-6022899?e=ff253ea0bd)\n\n- [Forefront Newsletter (1.23.23)](https://mailchi.mp/forefront/issue-6025631?e=ff253ea0bd)\n\n- [TLDR;

Our average wallet age is 2 years, and we maintain a pseudo-Sybil resistance structure through Farcaster. All of our members are non-anonymous.\n\n- Auction Success: Purple consistently ranks as the #1 or #2 token sale in the Nouns Builder universe daily, and we have the highest average auction sale price over the last 7 days compared to all other Nouns Builder DAOs.\n\n- Token Auction Revenue: We have successfully acquired 64 ETH through token auctions, with 34.3 ETH remaining in our treasury.\n\n- Active Governance: Our community has voted on 20 proposals, executing 16 of them to date.\n\n- Retroactive Funding and Bug Bounties: We have provided retroactive funding as well as bug bounties, demonstrating our commitment to the ongoing development and security of our platform.\n\n- Support for Builders: Purple has hosted 2 Prop Houses, offering support to multiple builders, including an open-source data project.\n\n- Technological Advancements: We have funded the integration of BotFrens with Farcaster for Nouns, BuilderDAO, and Purple, ensuring continued access to essential resources, particularly as Twitter becomes an increasingly challenging environment for developers.\n\n## What will we do with the BuilderDAO Grant?\n\nWith the support of the BuilderDAO grant, Purple aims to:\n\n- Amplify Funding for Public Goods and Nouns Builder Promotion: We will significantly scale up our efforts in funding Public Goods and discussing Nouns Builder across various media platforms. This expansion will attract even greater media attention and drive further growth.\n\n- Harness the Potential of Farcaster: We will capitalize on the recent advancements in Farcaster's protocol, including the release of hubs and the availability of Signin with Farcaster. By leveraging the energy within the Farcaster developer community, we aim to accelerate our efforts and attract more attention.\n\n- Implement Quadratic Funding with Gitcoin Allo: Purple will be among the first DAOs to conduct a Quadratic Funding round using Gitcoin Allo, further expanding our capabilities.\n\n- Focus on Nounish Tools and Collaborations: We will double down on Nounish tools, such as Prop House and Prop Lot, and actively seek collaborations with new tools and protocols to educate them about Nounish DAOs.\n\n- Engage in Ethereum Events and Scholarships: Our members will actively participate in major Ethereum events, sponsoring Farcaster meetups and offering scholarships when appropriate to strengthen our presence and influence within the community.\n\n- Innovate and Support Open-Source Contributions: We will continue to develop new approaches to bug bounties and attract contributors to the open-source Farcaster repositories. Additionally, we will provide retroactive funding for open infrastructure projects and rewards for developers who run hubs.\n\n## Benefits to BuilderDAO\n\nBy supporting Purple's initiatives, BuilderDAO stands to gain numerous advantages that will bolster its position within the Ethereum ecosystem. The enhanced visibility arising from Purple's promotion of Nouns Builder across various media platforms will increase awareness and attract more users and developers to the Nouns Builder software. Moreover, Purple's successes and innovative projects will reinforce BuilderDAO's reputation as a powerful platform for creating successful DAOs. As Purple expands the Nounish toolkit and collaborates with other Ethereum organizations, it will foster a richer and more diverse Nounish ecosystem, directly benefiting BuilderDAO by showcasing the versatility and adaptability of the Nouns Builder platform. Furthermore, Purple's active participation in Ethereum events, sponsorships, and educational outreach will drive the widespread adoption of Nouns Builder, strengthening BuilderDAO's market position. By partnering with other Ethereum organizations and exploring collaborations, Purple will create new opportunities for BuilderDAO to engage with projects that have the potential to enhance the Nounish DAO concept further. Finally, backing Purple's success and ensuring its continued growth will demonstrate BuilderDAO's commitment to supporting DAOs built using the Nouns Builder platform, encouraging more users to create their own DAOs with the confidence that BuilderDAO will support them.\n\n## Conclusion: A Joint Vision for Growth and Success for Nounish DAOs\n\nIn conclusion, Purple has demonstrated its potential as a thriving and innovative DAO that actively promotes the adoption and growth of Nouns Builder. By seeking the BuilderDAO grant, Purple aims to scale up its efforts, expand the Nounish ecosystem, and continue to drive the success of both Purple and BuilderDAO. By supporting Purple's initiatives, BuilderDAO will not only benefit from the numerous advantages that come with Purple's growth, but also reinforce its position as a powerful platform for creating successful DAOs. Together, Purple and BuilderDAO will foster a more connected and diverse community, pushing the boundaries of what Nounish DAOs can achieve and contributing to the overall advancement of the blockchain ecosystem.",

Space has been reserved for Bagels & Builders breakfast meetup for BuilderDAO and DAOs created on Nouns Builder for an opportunity to chat IRL with other nounish DAO builders. This will provide an opportunity to chat and share more about Builder, connect with fellow members and share best practices. A similar breakfast event is being planned for Thursday April 13 for Nouns.\n\nProf Werder has already paid for this event which is $2227.58 for 25 attendees. If we have a higher number, this may be adjusted. I have also purchased some merch (stickers, coasters, pins) as well that will be available at the event. A note: yes, this is high but unfortunately this is average for hotel catering in New York City. This event will be in a private dining space at a hotel in Times Square. I also checked local restaurants and pricing was not much less and would not provide a private space.  \n\nThis request is for 2 eth to cover expenses for this event and allow for a buffer in case of additional attendees. Prof Werder has created a discord channel to share additional info and will also have an RSVP form available if this prop passes. ",

This adds aesthetic value to public spaces and this approach can lead to more imaginative proposals. \n\n**Open-process** \n\n\nThe documentation of the mural creation process Including behind-the-scenes footage and time-lapse videos will provide your marketing team engaging content to share on social media your website and other on-chain or off-chain marketing channels. By having the documentation there are multiple opportunities created for media distribution through the DAO that can bring funds back to the treasury for example minting the final mural doc video as a [Droposal](https://zora.co/collections/0x3ffad892400f37d5ffae597935d345ccb628ebe7).  \n\n**Spreading the Builder meme** \n\n\"Why Bogotá?\". The most transparent answer is \"why not?\" The proliferation of street art and murals knows no bounds in Bogotá, which has many public spaces open to this form of expression. Additionally, Bogotá has a rapidly growing tech ecosystem, with startups, accelerators, and incubators popping up all over the city to grow the pool of open source contributors to the Builder Ecosystem. When people walk by the picture they might take a picture and show it to their friends on the computer. Then that picture can also start a conversation with people who can learn more about the organization. \n\n\n—\n\n\n### Estimate Timeline \n\n\n![image](https://bafybeih3u3wp26ynxsw6a3ebg7d36unscyeeb6syduyvop3t5t6pul5y4a.ipfs.nftstorage.link/)\n\n\n\n### Budget\n\n\n ![image](https://bafybeigt7q6o527l32bphm7fvtl3pfct2mc4dpdpdtjk5c7tprelopuqoy.ipfs.nftstorage.link/)\n\n\nMultiparty Split Wallet between project wallet and individual artist wallets: \n[0x93357Ac62aBAFA1ecF2f4C8b16F980EF31D409f1](0x93357Ac62aBAFA1ecF2f4C8b16F980EF31D409f1](https://etherscan.io/address/0x93357Ac62aBAFA1ecF2f4C8b16F980EF31D409f1)\n\nCommunication: \n\nUpdates on the project will be communicated in the Builder Discord via @valcoholics1 as Builder point of contact. \n\n—\n\n\nArtist Profiles \n\ndigital artist, painter, mural art [](https://foundation.app/@GOLIATH)\n![](https://bafybeif2kxcv4mp4qwjstlbzdz4we5raglblx62fa3jmgikhdqsbnkmwti.ipfs.nftstorage.link/) \n\n\nconcept artist, illustrator, designer [](https://www.paleinred.com/)\n![](https://bafybeidh3k2yroixvzg5edtd7a4t6etax3fsjtkwmvgte5c72dnhhmwidm.ipfs.nftstorage.link/) \n\n\npainter, designer, photographer and cinematographer [](https://www.kidcarol.com/)\n![](https://bafybeibnpp66r35y57cjvv5tjssw6qqovafauu57qllzec6qjuy4ghrixm.ipfs.nftstorage.link/) \n\n\ncurator, stencil artist, project manager, Builder [](https://twitter.com/valcoholics1)\n![](https://bafybeiaedke5wt7zwfi5t3tejrmuujni64ysxrjtx55hqpqcsdq24nsety.ipfs.nftstorage.link/)\n",

      "title": "iOS Widgets for all Nounish DAOs",
      "content": "### tl;dr\n\nWe propose expanding the successful Nouns Widgets to all DAOs created using the Builder tool. These widgets provide critical auction and governance data in a compact format, accessible right from users’ home screens. The expansion will offer various widget types, tailored for each DAO, and customizable notifications. Developed by NG, who has experience in the Nouns ecosystem, the project requires 15 ETH in funding to cover development, support, and infrastructure costs for one year.\n\n### Intro\n\nNouns Widgets have seen a success within NounsDAO, with many members using it to track proposals and auctions. They present the most critical data in a compact and easy-to-digest format helping holders always stay on track with the DAO. With them, you don’t need to open websites/applications to see the progress of auctions and proposals, as you can easily see this information right from your home screen.\n\nExample screen showing how it looks with NounsDAO example:\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeiavxir46m5bl6bxxwdhlngzyfmyipf3vjshqidhskafqv4vgsuajq)\n\nWith these widgets, you can see the currently auctioned noun, the current bid and how much time is left till the auction ends. You also see all the latest proposals and voting results for each.\nFollowing the success within NounsDAO, I propose expanding the widgets support to all DAOs created using the Builder tool so all members, no matter the DAO size and funding rate, can access great tools helping them with governance and auction life.\nI additionally reached out to BLVKHVND, Purple, mferbuilderDAO, XNouns, and Lil Toadz communities to see if they would be interested in these widgets and which they prefer. Here is the feedback I received:[ link to the photo with replies compilation.](https://i.imgur.com/ovbw89N.jpg)\n\n### Details\n\nNote: All provided designs are preliminary and will change in the future.\nUsers will have access to the website where they can search for DAOs they have joined or want to join. Additionally, it will contain a list of all DAO so people can look through it. They can also connect their wallet to access all joined DAOs easily.\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeia4eyr3tuqwpnrw3lnkfkva6lowpw2iaqx22frtsxxoetusbrdazi)\n\nWhen the user selects the DAO, he’ll be presented with all the available widgets tailored for this particular DAO. The last step is to choose the DAO and follow the installation steps.\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeiefnprol3mh2o4miodox4jt3ji7rwcslvrvw4tsluqkfgyxxtswka)\n\n### Types of widgets:\nAll users will get access to the following types of widgets:\n\n**Art.** View the currently auctioned artwork. Small and big-sized widgets.\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreictartnhbpsbkhyzifqo6frwo5mwcoa73ebhh6whm5def4oajvfj4)\n\n**Auction.** View the current state of the auction, the auctioned artwork and the time left. Small widget.\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreicpzsjttvfpcispjtbgs3vevxiye5hgcctso4dhqcwggly4bj4y6m)\n\n**Auction and Governance.** View current auction state and proposals. Medium and Big sizes widgets supported. When adding Big sized widget, proposals are shown with more details.\n\nMedium:\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreiawmpt4sifo6owwizedywj2rkl4oxdk7m6li2fh753yf5au3slrbi)\n\nBig:\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeibjpq2nlh263ckotbgwev3e62flhpjvfwe3fyfs7of2kt2lhd6l24)\n\n**Governace.** View pending and active proposals. Medium and Big sized widgets.\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafkreihb3uybtfpozkc3bw6kwgfp2yifaa7zjrb2tgrh2chjfvbioa2rsu)\n\n**Lock Screen.** View the current auction state and the number of active proposals from your lock screen.\n\n![image](https://ipfs.decentralized-content.com/ipfs/bafybeiaolzbfzwx7wckk4km734sz3issw4oxsvq6isy5sh6o46uhrbt6d4)\n\n**Notifications**\n\nAdditionally, with all widgets, users will be able to set up notifications:\nOn auction ending. Get notified 5 minutes before the auction end. Only notifications before the auction enters the “can be extended” state can be used.\nFor proposals. Users will be able to get reminded when the proposal goes to the “Voting” state or before voting closure(can set custom time before the voting period ends).\n\n**Who?**\n\nNG. I worked on many projects in the Nouns ecosystem. The latest include Nouns Widgets and Animate Nouns. I created experimental Fomo iOS and Android mobile apps and worked on the Fomo web app. More projects can be found here.\n\n**Funding**\n\nThe requested funding is 15 ETH with one-year coverage for support and infrastructure costs.\nThe funding will be used to expand the current systems to support all DAOs created with the Builder tooling and further improve the ease of installation of widgets.\n\n",

      "content": "Proposal for BuilderDAO Community Resident - Profwerder&&@Profwerder - \nProposal for BuilderDAO Community Resident\n\n\ntl:dr: Community is the core of all Nounish DAOs. This prop is to compensate the BuilderDAO/Nouns Builder Community Resident role (Prof Werder - Builder discord, Twitter and other outreach activities) retroactively and through March 2023.\n\nBudget Request: 16 eth plus 2 BuilderDAO tokens (November: retro payment of 2 BuilderDAO tokens minted via proposal (or from founder wallet) for creation of the discord and BuilderBox spaces; December, January, February March: 16 eth (4 eth per month) retro payment plus March.)\n\nThe week that the Nouns Builder launched, I decided to launch my own DAO so that I could understand how it worked and to be able to help others launch DAOs. I created JusttheFlamingo.wtf using Nouns.Build and then also launched a Notion Site where I captured screenshots of what I was doing (see Flamingos.wtf). I launched my DAO November 3 and by November 8, I created the Nouns Builder discord for those building on Nouns.Build. Soon we added BuilderDAO itself into the same discord.\n\nThe primary purpose – and one it has continued to serve – is as a spot for builders to get questions answered about Nouns.Build. I’ve been the conduit filtering questions to Zora support and making sure we had clear channels for that purpose. With Zaak from Zora on board just recently and with a more active presence in discord, this has become a bit more streamlined.\n\nWhat started as a place for DAO founders expanded to become the center of Nouns Builder and BuilderDAO. The same week, I launched Just DAO it! As a Noun Square SoapBox which has evolved to BuilderBox and is currently the only consistent and continuous marketing for NounsBuilder and BuilderDAO.\n\n\nIn December, the DAO launched its first set of Prop House rounds which amped up the activity in the discord tremendously and created more work related to that including adding specific prop house channels and holding spaces for that purposes. During Christmas week, we were one of the few holding SoapBox spaces to ensure that those participating in prop house could share their props.\n\nIn January, David Kerr came on board and we started town halls for purposes of discussing some of the legal and organizational aspects. This has included holding weekly town halls in discord, processing recordings and notes, and keeping this organized for those who can not make the meetings and have questions. Again, this has led to an increased flurry of activity.\n\nIn February, the 2nd prop house led to some additional reorganizing of discord and ensuring channels were added for all funded projects. Throughout the month I’ve continued to facilitate the town halls and other requests.\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nMoving forward, I will continue the discord community through March and start to build additional value through workshops and other activities that I will facilitate (or organize and promote), along with other core team members. I originally was planning to submit a prop through May but feel a focus on an overall budget would be better. We’ve been bogged down with some administrative issues but I hope we can move on soon and start to make this a more builder focused environment where the promise of DAOs can help be fulfilled. What I’d like to focus on moving forward is:\n\n⌐◨-◨ Stickier spots for builder tools such as notion, a website, etc\n\n⌐◨-◨ BuilderBox Twitter to focus on promoting DAOs built on Nouns Builder and education around it\n\n⌐◨-◨ Events both online and in person to promote Nouns Builder and help users\n\n⌐◨-◨ Seek speaking opportunities at NFT events and podcasts to share Nouns Builder and BuilderDAO\n\n⌐◨-◨ Work with other core contributors to create a DAO incubator series\n\n⌐◨-◨ Continue and improve the discord as a central hub for Nouns Builder and BuilderDAO including adding auto-mod to answer FAQ’s\n\n⌐◨-◨ Expand BuilderBox as a marketing piece by making it more valuable as an asynchronous piece as well via a podcast and audio clips\n\nAs part of this prop, and with the payments from this prop as consideration, I will also formerly agree to maintain the discord and will be working on a way to make that ownership accessible and shared. At this time I am the sole owner and this is a potential failure point so we’ll work to make this more decentralized in a way and I ensure that the institutional memory located there will not be lost.\n\nI encourage everyone to search my name in the discord to get a better feel of what my activity has been, as well as BuilderBox spaces and welcome any and all questions.\n\nBudget request:\n\nNovember: retro payment of 2 BuilderDAO tokens minted via proposal (or from founder wallet) for creation of the discord and BuilderBox spaces\n\nDecember, January, February March: 16 eth (4 eth per month) retro payment plus March.\n\nRetro payment total: 16eth plus 2 Builder Tokens: to thenounishprof.eth 0xCEEd9585854F12F81A0103861b83b995A64AD915\n\nTotal: 16 eth plus 2 BuilderDAO tokens\n\nFor reference–Residencies in the Nouniverse:\n\nFor comparison, the Nouns Community Resident (Noun22) has been paid on average $32k/mo. or equal to approx. 20 eth at current eth price. I believe Lil Al’s residence at 7.5 eth/mo is more in line with what market rate is and should be, and I’ve come in close to that with an adjustment due to change in eth. See specific props below for additional information.\n\nLil Nouns\n\nLil dot (lil nounder): 6 eth/month https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/79\n\nLil Al: Resident (community manager) – 45eth/6 months (appox 7.5eth/mo) https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/76 and https://lilnouns.wtf/vote/15 50eth and 4eth bonus\n\nNouns\n\nFund design, engineering, and community contributors – https://nouns.wtf/vote/17 1 5.9 eth/mo (BrianJ, Noun22 and ???)\n\nNoun22 core contributor (community resident): https://nouns.wtf/vote/38 62.52414 ETH over 6 months (10.42069 ETH per month)\n\nNoun22 re-up: https://nouns.wtf/vote/111 1 $32k per month for 6 months\n\nBrianJ: https://nouns.wtf/vote/45 62.52414 ETH over 6 months (10.42069 ETH per month\n\nVerbs: https://nouns.wtf/vote/54 2 engineers @ 10.4269 ETH per person per month (re-up: https://nouns.wtf/vote/106 $37.5k per person (2) per month (6) paid in USDC or ETH and https://nouns.wtf/vote/192 1\n\nCdt residency: https://nouns.wtf/vote/61 $175K* paid over 6 months in USDC which equates to roughly 8.5E/month by todays valuation.

The 95.32 ETH spent acquiring Noun 401 will be recovered from mint proceeds and anything over that amount will be used to seed our treasury in support of people interested in building on the protocol.</p><p><strong>Our vision&nbsp;is a multiplayer future</strong> for crypto and we firmly believe NFTs are the building blocks. By providing public goods infrastructure to the community we can empower developers artists collectors projects and DAOs to unlock a new design space for creative onchain experiences. Shortly after the execution of this proposal we will have a UI available at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://omega.build/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(32 80 151);\">omega.build</a>&nbsp;to interface seamlessly with our protocol so anyone include Builder DAO itself can deploy their own Omega contracts. Here are a few examples to inspire some ideas in the meantime:</p><ul><li><strong>Developers</strong>&nbsp;could create their own onchain gaming experiences leveraging the fair and trustless raffle drawing protocol to offer exciting and transparent gameplay to their users. They can also use the open and free architecture of the Omega protocol to build innovative games that can be easily integrated with existing NFT collections.</li><li><strong>Artists</strong>&nbsp;could showcase and monetize their creations by raffling off their NFT artworks and engaging with their audiences through onchain games. They can also leverage the hyperstructure design of the Omega protocol to create unique gaming experiences that incorporate their own artistic vision.</li><li><strong>Collectors</strong>&nbsp;could win high-value NFTs through exciting and transparent onchain games. They can also provide liquidity to the platform by offering their NFT collections as entry tickets for other players.</li><li><strong>DAOs</strong>&nbsp;could deploy raffles in a single proposal transaction offering an easy and convenient way to engage their communities and distribute their high-value tokens.</li></ul><p><strong>We want to keep building</strong> on top of Omega and deploy new games with the Builder DAO community. For new releases we are considering more fun ways to engage collectors and participants with games incorporating unique auction mechanics tournaments like Squid Game and so on. Here are some of the benefits of the Omega protocol:</p><ul><li><strong>Fairness and trustlessness:</strong>&nbsp;The Omega protocol is designed to be a fair and trustless platform as it employs a raffle drawing protocol that uses Chainlink VRF to ensure verifiable randomness. This means that all participants have an equal chance of winning and the results are transparent and auditable.</li><li><strong>Open and free:</strong>&nbsp;The Omega protocol is open and free meaning that anyone can use it at no cost. This makes it easy for developers to create innovative games and for artists to monetize their creations.</li><li><strong>Hyperstructure:</strong>&nbsp;The Omega protocol is designed as a hyperstructure providing a platform for builders to create and innovate for artists to showcase and monetize their creations and for collectors to win high-value NFTs or provide liquidity. This makes it possible to create a variety of onchain games each with their own unique features and gameplay mechanics.</li><li><strong>Onboarding opportunities:</strong>&nbsp;The Omega protocol offers exciting new onboarding opportunities as any new or existing NFT collection can be referenced as entry tickets. This means that players can use their existing NFT collections as entry tickets for onchain games making it easy for players to get involved and start winning.</li><li><strong>DAO governance:</strong>&nbsp;The Omega protocol is governed by a nounish DAO providing a community-driven approach to managing the protocol. This ensures that the platform is transparent fair and accountable and that the interests of all participants are represented.</li></ul><p><strong>Thank you Builders</strong>&nbsp;for your time taken to consider our proposal and to vote.</p><p>Gami Emre Iain and Jordan.</p><p>⌐◨-◨</p>",

      "title": "Family Nouns DAO Proliferating For Generations",
      "content": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p><p>A DAO building a community of Nounish families, and creating a family focused mobile and web app to drive engagement. This family DAO experience will make it super easy and fun to welcome families into Nouns to create Nounish things together. Using Nouns Builder, the DAO will bring together the community while funding the development of a family friendly platform for Nouns.</p><p>The overall vision for Family Nouns DAO is to proliferate Nouns and do good for families across the world at scale.&nbsp;</p><p>This prop is to fund a new DAO with the remit to enable effective community engagement, build a family friendly front end, web and mobile app, as well as create characters and experiment in family friendly governance.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://hackmd.io/@ChrisCoCreated/familynouns\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>PLEASE CLICK LINK FOR FULL PROPOSAL WITH IMAGES AND LINKS HERE!</strong></a></p><p>--</p><p><strong>Why</strong></p><p>So families create together, have fun together, learn together, and most importantly proliferate together. Providing a family-friendly access point into Nouns. It will take generational change for Nouns to have its full impact, this prop starts to lay the foundations to bring in the next generation.</p><p>The fun, absurdity and accessibility of Nouns makes a rich, creative space for different ages to create with each other. Bringing families together with Family Nouns will benefit improved mental health, relationships, education, and reduced stress. Our goal is for families to have more fun, do more good, and spread more nounishness. And as a result, share the positive impacts with their friends, creating a positive self reinforcing loop.</p><p><strong><em>“The best thing for me about Nouns is that my 9-year-old daughter is into it with me”.</em></strong></p><p>We will make it easy for families to get involved in Nouns together, maintain motivation, and create a simple on-ramp into Nouns, community governance, and web3.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Public Goods &amp; Proliferation</strong></p><p>Nouns has the potential to bring hundreds of thousands of families to create together and in doing so, can generate significant social benefit.</p><p>The family is a massive subculture that we can activate in a significant way. Most families are already a bit nounish; they like to have fun and make the world better. We’ll make it easy to become fully noun-pilled.</p><p>Families are great proliferators. They tell other families. They play with each other and the meme spreads. Families and young Nounish creators also make for great stories. This is the Family Nouns flywheel.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Vision</strong></p><p>The vision is for these kinds of stories to compound through network effects:</p><p>- A 12-year-old girl noun-pills her Dad, becomes the youngest member of Nouncil, is a fractional owner of a Noun with her Dad, and recently spoke on stage about Nouns in Australia.</p><p>- A Nounish professor convinces her teenage son to create a Nounish collection and work together with his mom! What teenager does that?</p><p>- A nounish dad co-creates all things Nounish with his 9-year-old daughter to the point that she enters The NounSquare contests on her own and releases her own AniNouns collection to the world.</p><p>We want to spread this Nounishness and bring in 100, 1,000, and 100,000 more nounish stories like these. We want to reach existing nounish families and those not yet familiar with Nouns and activate the family subculture.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The Challenge</strong></p><p>It is currently difficult for families to create on Nouns because there isn’t an experience designed for parents and children. From our experience as parents wanting to bring our kids into nouns there are 3 key reasons:</p><p><strong><em>1. Community experiences don’t work for the kids in our lives (twitter, discord, spaces etc)</em></strong></p><p><em>- They don’t have a profile</em></p><p><em>- The content isn’t directed at them.</em></p><p><strong><em>2. Finding and creating activities takes time</em></strong></p><p><em>- Time poor families need it to be easy</em></p><p><strong><em>3. When they don’t get feedback on their creations they aren’t motivated</em></strong></p><p><em>- They want a place to share and people to care</em></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Proposed Solution</strong></p><p>Utilizing a DAO structure, we can collaboratively create the app and other tools needed to bring this community together. We will create a platform to nurture a community, build an app, and develop an ecosystem for nounish families to come together, create and share.</p><p>This will be provided through an app (web, iOS and Android), discord and socials (collectively the platform). The app will be the main point of participation. We will use socials to engage with parents and to share the families creations with the wider community.</p><p>The platform, focused on 4-12 year olds and their parents, will include the development of new activities, integrate existing Nounish family-friendly activities, and bring future activities into a single experience that builds a strong family-focused community.</p><p>To make the platform as accessible as possible we will focus on the nounish experience, not the technology. It will be a Web2 platform in the first instance, focused on ease of use and enjoyment. Web3 elements are on the roadmap, with the intention for users to be able to ‘bridge’ their assets onto a web3 chain.</p><p>The focus for this prop is to get the core experience working well and becoming sticky with the beta testers who we are nurturing as the early adopters and core community.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Community</strong></p><p>We will build a community of families creating together with Nouns. This will provide encouragement, fun, friendship, and support in the nounish family journey. Through this prop we will establish the early community of 50-100 families, some already nounish and some not-yet nounish, who will beta test the experience.</p><p><strong>The Community will provide a place to <em>do things</em> together:</strong></p><p><em>- Contests to create together and then share with the community, as well as collective efforts as a community</em></p><p><em>- Gamified ecosystem that rewards users for daily activities and community engagement with native tokens, POAPs, and leaderboards</em></p><p><em>- Creative ideas, thought out and prepared for busy families to easily start creating together. No fuss. No hassle. Just jump in. (“Family creative fun in a box”)</em></p><p><em>- Encouragement for families to get together and do stuff</em></p><p><em>- Activity collabs with other Nouns communities such as “baking cookies with Food Nouns”, \"grind with Gnars\"</em></p><p><br></p><p>The Community will provide a place for <strong>belonging</strong>:</p><p><em>- A natural place and way for families to gather together in this new world of a nounish journey</em></p><p><em>- A place to bring friends and families you know to share in the fun and creativity</em></p><p><em>- A place to potentially reach out to families facing challenges, bringing creativity and fun</em></p><p>We will explore standard options like Twitter and Discord, but will also seek to creatively use tools that are natural to web2 families ranging from email to IRL and everything in between. How we do this most effectively for families will be an experiment.</p><p>The core of the family experience will be the app which provides the space for families to find activities, share what they create and get positive feedback.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>App</strong></p><p><strong>Build an app that enables families to find nounish activities and create and share together.</strong></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>- A platform that brings together all nounish activities for families into one easy to use experience where families will be able to:</p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Make a family pfp and profile</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Create a nounish pfp in-app, using traits that you earn for completing and sharing activities.

In doing so, we transitioned from seeding our DAO's inception, to seeding its presence within the Nouns Builder infra as a conduit to push forth more competitive DAOs in our wake.

This led us to working with Nouns on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nouns.wtf/vote/91\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Prop 91</a>: an expansion for Nouns Esports which resulted in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2H4BDHdXHP4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">first DAO v DAO world championship in esports history.</a>&nbsp;In addition, BLVKHVND helped Nouns acquire a championship Pokemon Unite team and proliferated \"Nounish\" branding throughout events, jerseys, and creative content. Based on the success of our initial exploration of the Nouns ecosystem,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/BLVKHVND/status/1607236654799921152\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">we took the steps to evolve our organization as a \"Nounish\" DAO.</a></p><h2><br></h2><h2>LAUNCHING BLVKHVND ONCHAIN</h2><p>BLVKHVND has grown into a force within the esports competitive arena. Our application of Nouns Builder is tool and opportunity to bring BLVKHVND fully onchain. This move puts our brand into a permissionless environment where it has a chance to be owned and stewarded by everyone on the internet. So far, we've proliferated BLVKHVND through a steady mix of merch, editorials, social content, IRL sponsorships, and NFT drops. Our daily auctions allow us to onboard new and existing contributors as well as capture value from our meme and competitive success.</p><p>When we started, we went from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sirsu.mirror.xyz/pw_gqx_IzpRD6-3wXaUpmvUNvdXP1a4LBDy1lozndc4\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">an essay,</a>&nbsp;to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blvkhvnd.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0x320d83769Eb64096Ea74B686Eb586E197997f930\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">crowdfunded DAO via Mirror</a>&nbsp;in August of 2021. The unexpected but incredible gift of funding allowed us to experiment and explore the esports at its fullest–sponsoring 6 competitive teams in multiple regions, traveling around the world to gather research on IRL event programming and league development, sponsoring events and public goods initiatives, as well as incepting our vision for a connected, transparent, equitable esports industry. Our first year presented many challenges from player negotiations, delayed pay from event hosts, financial market failures–we were put through the ringer. And yet, to make history, bring home a World Title, and show the industry that web3 is viable in their world made this journey worth the trouble. And now, with those lessons, we are clear in what our next steps are.</p><p>The inclusion of BuilderDAO created an open pathway for fans and other enthusiasts of BLVKHVND to get involved in a much clearer and concise way than our initial approach.

We’ve been very excited to see props from our friends at Forefront, Purple, and Public Assembly, make great use of BUILDER funds and/or tools that integrate BUILDER into their communities.</p><p>To ensure chain of custody, any prop we propose directly to $BUILDER or BuilderDAO Prop House will always route to our DAO treasury&nbsp;<code style=\"background-color: var(--theme-ui-colors-foregroundSecondary, var(--colors-foregroundSecondary));\">thehvnddao.eth</code>&nbsp;(we assigned this ens to the nouns smart contract).</p><p>Based on our current support of a competitive team (Apex Legends), and the direction of our community, if our proposal passes, here are some of the initial ideas we seek to propose to our community:</p><ul><li>Compensate our creative team for the DAO artwork</li><li>Sponsor Competitive Teams in games like Apex Legends / Parallel / Halo Infinite</li><li>Launch BLVKHVND Prop House to fund intra-community led projects</li><li>Proliferate the #heavyistheHVND meme</li></ul><p><strong>Compensate our creative team for the DAO artwork</strong></p><p>The DAO Artwork compensation will be delivered to sirsu.eth, co-founder dillonatm.eth, collaborator darthjarjar.eth, as well as a small gift to the Shields project for implementing their CC0 elements into our work.</p><p><strong>Launch Competitive Teams in games like Apex Legends / Parallel / Halo Infinite</strong></p><p>Our current Apex Team is on track to qualify and compete in Split 2 of Pro League. Upon qualification of the Pro League, those players will represent BLVKHVND during the second half of the pro season. Similarly, our former Halo EU team wants to represent BLVKHVND to kick off the first major of the Halo Championship Series (year 2). Through governance, we can encourage other prospects to directly pitch to the DAO for support rather than the DAO scouting for talent.</p><p>We are investigating compensation models that leverage both proposal/onchain governance, and also faucet funding mechanisms that can be dynamically applied to proposals that require a longer time horizon to deem either successful or unsuccessful. This enables us to fine tune the fidelity of the DAO’s support of competitive teams with the flexibility to adjust a given proposal’s allocation based on performance and other factors.</p><p><strong>Launch BLVKHVND Prop House</strong></p><p>We applied to create a Prop House for BLVKHVND to issue grants toward unique projects birthed out of the BLVKHVND community, provide funding mechanisms to support and onboard esport talent to compete, and a means for anyone to contribute to BLVKHVND and our growing ecosystem (STADIUM Protocol &amp; Broadcast Media).</p><p>An initiative we are currently investigating:</p><ul><li>BLVKHVND Terminal. We started this process last year with one of our core contributors druzy.eth to build a UI of BLVKHVND’s onchain activities. Based on the work Public Assembly has also done with Nouns Builder, there’s potentia to finalize the Terminal work that we’ve worked on and combine it with the work the Public Assembly team have set up for nounish DAOs and push an open repo for other DAO’s to utilize.</li></ul><p><strong>Proliferate the #heavyistheHVND meme</strong></p><p>We’ve seen the examples many nounish communities have shown as it relates to memeification, culture signaling, and active participation through open mints and most recently, the DAO itself creating, minting, and selling their artifacts to the community and audiences abroad. While the current esports landscape prevents most organizations from minting incredible gameplay moments, there’s so much more to gaming culture that can be explored.</p><p>Here’s a few ways our community has been thinking about this:</p><ul><li>Deploying merch and collaborating with other DAOs to building bridges between communities with meaningful gear</li><li>Viral marketing via beverages (Red Bull but onchain)</li><li>New music to complement our “Heavy is the HVND” theme song</li></ul><p><strong>ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</strong></p><p><em>Partners:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Zora</strong>&nbsp;is a founding partner.

In all those conversations, one commonality shared amongst the community is alignment on the need to onboard accountants and other advisors to assist the DAO with developing a legal and tax compliance strategy while maintaining operational flexibility.</p><p>The DAO can address this issue by voting yes on this proposal authorizing administrators to take certain delegated actions in furtherance of these goals.</p><p>As established in the DAO’s Association Agreement, administrators have limited authority and are narrowly empowered to perform specific tasks delegated by the DAO. They do not have the independent authority to bind the DAO to contracts without specific authorization or utilize broad discretion in their decision making. So, by design, follow-up proposals will be necessary to authorize DAO members to execute specific real-world activities to complete operational actions on behalf of the DAO.</p><p>Over time, the frequency of such proposals should decrease but the nature of authority being delegated for the performance of particular tasks will always require authorization from a validly executed governance proposal.</p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nouns.build/dao/0xdf9b7d26c8fc806b1ae6273684556761ff02d422/vote/0x64b087da7e057ce25282013d5163d01a75dc792cb0b99222e4cd450bf808c796\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--tertiary); background-color: transparent;\">Builder DAO Launch and UNA Formation Proposal</a>&nbsp;was passed on November 17, 2022, provided authorization to the Founders to take steps to form and operate the UNA. This proposal withdraws and replaces that authorization with more specific authorizations outlined below.</p><p><strong>Proposal</strong></p><p><em>1) Authorize DAO members David Kerr and Zora as administrators to engage legal and tax advisors for the DAO</em></p><p>Under this authorization, David and Zora are authorized to take the following actions on behalf of the DAO:</p><ul><li>Recommend legal and tax service providers (including outside counsel, tax preparers, and bookkeepers) to the DAO and, following the DAO’s approval of service provider compensation via proposal vote, enter into engagement letters with such service providers.</li><li>Engage in confidential discussions with legal and tax service providers to obtain guidance regarding key compliance issues impacting the DAO</li><li>Make administrative decisions regarding the form of guidance to be provided (e.g. determining work product format, frequency of calls, agendas for meetings)</li><li>Review and summarize all material guidance for other DAO members, and propose strategies to achieve legal and tax compliance goals.</li><li>Execute required filings and reports, including to elect corporate taxation and sign, file, and pay taxes</li></ul><p>Commitment - This is intended to be an ongoing commitment. Authorization will last until the DAO removes the authorization or the administrators resign.</p><p><em>2) Authorize DAO members David Kerr and Kyler Wandler to take necessary steps to finalize the establishment of the UNA in Wyoming and allow it to perform its core compliance and reporting functions.</em></p><p>Under this authorization, David and Kyler are authorized to take, or sign documentation allowing the DAO to take, the following actions on behalf of the DAO:</p><ul><li>Attain an Employer Identification Number (“EIN”)</li><li>Attain a registered agent for service of process and serve as contacts for the DAO for service of process.</li><li>File service of process with the Secretary of State of Wyoming</li><li>Attain a service provider capable of remitting tax payments</li><li>Make de minimis payments (i.e. less than $500) solely in furtherance of these listed goals, to be reimbursed by the DAO following submission of expenses by the administrator.</li></ul><p>Commitment</p><ul><li><strong>Contact for Registered Agent</strong>&nbsp;- This is intended to be an ongoing commitment. Authorization will last until the DAO removes the authorization.</li><li><strong>Other Authorizations</strong>&nbsp;- These are intended to be limited commitments. The authorization will end as soon as the tasks required to accomplish these listed goals above are completed.</li></ul><p><strong>Compensation</strong></p><p>All administrators named in this proposal are willing to provide these services without compensation, so no payments are required for the time being (in the future, administrator compensation should be considered in relation to the time commitment on the part of administrators).</p><p>My motivation in this project is not to carve out a compensated role within the community for myself, but to assist in the utilization of an entity form that can be essential to reducing the risks around DAOs and allowing the community to pursue its objective of creating a public good within the space. Accordingly, it is my intention to serve as an administrator until the necessary requirements are functioning such that other members of the community would be able to step in and continue to perform tasks as needed with compensation being considered at that time.</p><p>My relevant writings on DAOs can be found here:</p><p><a href=\"https://a16z.com/2022/05/23/dao-legal-frameworks-entity-features-selection/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: var(--tertiary); background-color: transparent;\">DAO Entity Features &amp; Entity Selection | Andreessen Horowitz (a16z.com)</a></p>",

We see Nouns Builder as both a tool and opportunity to bring BLVKHVND fully onchain. Moving ourselves onchain puts our brand into a permissionless environment where it has a chance to be owned and stewarded by everyone on the internet. So far, we've proliferated BLVKHVND through a steady mix of merch, editorials, social content, IRL sponsorships, and NFT drops. Daily auctions would allow us to onboard new and existing contributors as well as capture value from our meme and competitive success.</p><p><br></p><p>Additionally, this move helps us create onchain infrastructure for the esports ecosystem such as  [STADIUM](<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ProjectStadium\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);

Here users will be able to make NAMELESS style art components from any image file.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Immediate next steps involve improving the 21_SVG engine by adding K-NN, CNNs and other machine learning algorithms to enhance performance across a wider range of image complexities and properties. A DAO’s specific configuration can be used by developers to easily build new components, but also by the community to “Namelessify”, “Nounsify” or “Any-DAO-You-Choosify” an image.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">By Q2 2023, we hope to make 21_SVG a fully open-source projectthat is maintained by the NAMELESS DAO, but widely used and contributed to by anyone. This would include the development of usable software packages for 21_SVG image generation, as well as replicable web-app templates for DAO websites looking to integrate 21_SVG.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">As adoption grows, we would also like to create community engagement around 21_SVG through an application which can aggregate 21_SVG configurations and artwork outputs. A space where DAOs using 21_SVG can be highlighted, and their art styles easily shared and interacted with.</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The ultimate goal is to provide a tool for DAO member engagement, where components can be created, tested, and proposed by any member.

Here users will be able to make NAMELESS style art components from any image file.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Immediate next steps involve improving the 21_SVG engine by adding K-NN, CNNs and other machine learning algorithms to enhance performance across a wider range of image complexities and properties. A DAO’s specific configuration can be used by developers to easily build new components, but also by the community to “Namelessify”, “Nounsify” or “Any-DAO-You-Choosify” an image.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">By Q2 2023, we hope to make 21_SVG a fully open-source projectthat is maintained by the NAMELESS DAO, but widely used and contributed to by anyone. This would include the development of usable software packages for 21_SVG image generation, as well as replicable web-app templates for DAO websites looking to integrate 21_SVG.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">As adoption grows, we would also like to create community engagement around 21_SVG through an application which can aggregate 21_SVG configurations and artwork outputs. A space where DAOs using 21_SVG can be highlighted, and their art styles easily shared and interacted with.</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">The ultimate goal is to provide a tool for DAO member engagement, where components can be created, tested, and proposed by any member. We hope that adoption of the 21_SVG platform will engage, enhance and inspire other projects that hope to make generative, on-chain art fun and accessible to all. We look forward to working with the Nouns Builder community to help test, enhance and expand usage of 21_SVG.</span></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">NAMELESS Collaborators &amp; Partner Organizations:</strong><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@boweryshowroom?lang=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><strong>@BoweryShowroom</strong></a><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"> </span><a href=\"https://www.notgoodcompany.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><strong>@notgoodcompany</strong></a></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">Past NAMELESS Partners:</strong><a href=\"https://streetfc.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><strong>StreetFC</strong></a><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">, </strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wburghotel/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><strong>The Williamsburg Hotel</strong></a><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">, </strong><a href=\"https://playgroundapp.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><strong>Playground App</strong></a><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">, </strong><a href=\"https://streetfc.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><strong>StreetFC</strong></a><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">, </strong><a href=\"https://www.levelingtheplayingfield.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><strong>Leveling the Playing Field</strong></a><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">, </strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/schoolyardsocial/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><strong>Schoolyard Social</strong></a><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">, </strong><a href=\"https://www.topochico.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><strong>Topo Chico</strong></a><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Our Links</h2><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">GITHUB: </strong><a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/Nameless-Youth-Club/repositories\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><strong>NAMELESS Github</strong></a><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">WEBSITE URL: </strong><a href=\"http://namelessyouthclub.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><strong>nameless.nyc</strong></a></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">INSTAGRAM: </strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nameless.nyc/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><strong>@nameless</strong></a><strong style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\">.nyc</strong></p><p><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">TWITTER: </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/nameless_nyc\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(17, 85, 204);\"><strong>@nameless_nyc</strong></a><strong style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);\">&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Treasury Breakdown</h2><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">20 ETH Total</span></p><p><span style=\"color: rgb(33, 37, 41);

It is a foundational component of crypto and the Internet by allowing individuals and teams to collaborate, learn, and innovate through public sharing of code with no or few restrictions on use. Often, OSS is under-funded and -resourced causing important projects to slow or stop development and not grow contributor bases beyond individual maintainers.</p><p><a href=\"https://wagmi.sh/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 122, 183); background-color: transparent;\">wagmi</a>&nbsp;is a popular open-source library used by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nouns.build/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 122, 183); background-color: transparent;\">Nouns Builder</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ens.domains/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 122, 183); background-color: transparent;\">ENS</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sushi.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 122, 183); background-color: transparent;\">Sushi</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://looksrare.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 122, 183); background-color: transparent;\">LooksRare</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://walletconnect.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 122, 183); background-color: transparent;\">WalletConnect</a>, and many more projects to connect and interact with Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains.

This gives DAOs the ability to add, modify and remove founders shares via proposal.</p><p>With this new feature DAO creators will have the ability to modify any errors that may have been caused at DAO deployment.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Upgrade Visibility</h3><p>In V1.1, each smart contract of a DAO now has an explicit version attached. This means that members and developers will be able easily understand which protocol implementation a DAO is utilizing at any given time.</p><p>This will also make it easier for future upgrades that are in development: including&nbsp;<em>airdrops</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>custom metadata renderers</em>.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Proposal Spam Fix</h3><p>Proposal submission to a DAO has an incorrectly implemented check which can allow for spam proposals to be submitted to a DAO. In V1.1 it works as expected.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Auction Improvements</h3><p>Improved bid handling and edge case management in the Auction House contracts.</p><h3><br></h3><h3>Author</h3><p>This upgrade has been developed and proposed by&nbsp;<strong>Zora</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://etherscan.io/address/0xd1d1d4e36117ab794ec5d4c78cbd3a8904e691d0\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(51, 122, 183); background-color: transparent;\">zora.eth</a>)</p>",

(“Zora”) and Nouns DAO (collectively the “Founders”) for their services to Builder DAO.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Why UNA</em></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">An Unincorporated Nonprofit Association helps solve the three biggest challenges facing DAOs without an entity structure, namely: i) the lack of legal existence (inability to contract or hold property at the entity level); ii) inability to pay taxes; and iii) potential unlimited liability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Wyoming law grants UNAs a legal entity separate from its members capable of holding property. and allows UNAs to elect corporate taxation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">By forming an UNA in Wyoming, Builder DAO can avail itself of limited liability protection, can address tax reporting and liabilities in a clear manner, and can support anonymous membership.&nbsp;Forming in the US adds trust, more regulatory clarity, and accessibility for US-based members and activity.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Association Agreement</em></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">The Association Agreement (reproduced below) establishes the agreement between DAO members to abide by the Governing Principles of the Builder DAO UNA, which is a combination of the Association Agreement, the on-chain Governance Protocol (smart contracts giving rise to quorum, voting, control of the treasury and control of the Builder DAO Protocol), and any current and future validly enacted Governance Proposals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Specific Authorization of Administrative Authority</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"> </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">&amp;</em><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"> </span><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Compensation&nbsp;</em></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">This proposal authorizes the Founders to act as administrators of the UNA to take any necessary steps for the formation and operation of the UNA, including to:</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">- attain an EIN;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">- obtain legal and tax guidance for Builder DAO;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">- elect corporate taxation and sign, file, and pay taxes;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">- attain a registered agent for service of process;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">- file service of process with the Secretary of State of Wyoming; and&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">- attain a bank account</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Zora shall also be authorized as a service provider&nbsp;to host and maintain the Builder Protocol codebase on behalf of the DAO.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">As outlined in the Association Agreement, administrators are narrowly empowered to perform specific tasks and do not contain the authority to bind the DAO to contracts or utilize broad discretion in their decision making.&nbsp;In the event additional authorization is required beyond this Governance Proposal, an additional Governance Proposal must be made and validly executed.&nbsp;As the DAO membership expands, it is expected that the administrative duties will be more widely dispersed within the membership with many of the initial grants of authority having only been necessary to complete formation of the UNA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Compensation</em></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">As the Founders have made significant financial and creative contribution to the Builder DAO and will continue to provide services in furtherance of the DAO’s purpose (providing free technological infrastructure for the development of new models of DAOs as an organizational framework for community engagement, collective decision-making, and innovation), they will receive Builder DAO NFTs at intervals defined within the Builder DAO Protocol as compensation for their continued efforts for a period of five years after the launch of the DAO.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Scheduled Review of this Proposal</em></p><p><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">We will revisit this proposal after Builder DAO has minted </span>60<span style=\"background-color: transparent;\"> NFTs to review existing administrator authorizations and evaluate whether to cease, amend, or redelegate the authorizations to the broader Builder DAO community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p><strong style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Builder DAO NFT Terms</strong></p><p><em style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Protocol &amp;
