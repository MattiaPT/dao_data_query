      "content": "\"Project Stone Transmutation\" is our response to the challenges and opportunities that have shaped the Alchemist journey. We remain committed to retaining the core ideas and essential parts of our original model. A key shift is the 1% inflation every two weeks, with all inflation now directed as esMist (EscrowedMist) – it's a strategic decision to align incentives for our community. The esMist model provides a 1-year linear vesting period, enabling tokens to be vested in a vault according to predetermined ratios. \n\n\n**Escrowed Mist (esMIST) can be:**\n- Staked for farming more esMIST.\n- Vested to transform into MIST tokens over 1 year linear\n    \nMultiplierPoints (MP) is a mechanism to reward long-term holders. Tokens staked accrue points continuously. On unstaking, a proportion of MP is deducted, ensuring the value of the remaining points. \n\n\n**A few Challenges We Identified:**\n- Addressing inflationary pressures through strategic measures.\n- Tackling the complex task of distributing undistributed MIST.\n- Enhancing our token distribution mechanisms to mitigate adverse effects.\n- Overcoming governance difficulties and other challenges.\n    \nThe integration of EtherTulips amplifies our path forward. We're bringing the EtherTulips community and team into the Alchemist family. Both Alchemist & EtherTulips stem from our shared creator, aiming to synergize our efforts and expand our capabilities. The EtherTulips team, post-integration, will be a key part in shaping the new governance layer for our incubation model based on our new tokenomics. \n\n\n**With this evolution, we aim to:**\n- Transition to a more agile and responsive tokenomics/governance model, tailored to the needs of our short council terms.\n- Lay a resilient foundation that supports continuous growth and evolution.\n    \nBy combining our strengths, refining our token approach, and building a united community, \"Project Stone Transmutation\" sets the stage for a stronger and more aligned Alchemist journey.",

      "title": "MIP-1: MIST Tokenomics Improvement",
      "content": "**MIP-1: MIST Tokenomics, A Proposed Catalyst for Growth**\n\nThe details of the new tokenomics proposal are as follows:\n1. Redirect the MIST inflation currently sent to existing MIST-WETH LP stakers to instead go to the Alchemist Multisig for the sole purpose of funding and incubating new products.\n2. Redirect up to a maximum of half of the revenue airdrop going to MIST-WETH LPs Rewards to go to single-sided MIST stakers in a new rewards program called “Community Harvest Alchemist Distribution (CHAD)” aka “CHAD Stakers Rewards”. The proportion of revenue redirected is variable and will be determined by the proportion of single-sided MIST being staked relative to current free-floating MIST supply. Rename the Aludel Rewards for MIST-WETH LPs as “CHAD LPs Rewards”.\n3. Revenue airdrops for both CHAD rewards programs would be airdropped in the currencies that they are earned in, rather than MIST. Historically these native tokens would include USDC, ETH, WETH.\n4. To be eligible for CHAD Stakers Rewards, one’s tokens need to be locked in the CHAD program for a minimum period of 90 days. Withdrawing a stake prematurely will result in the forfeiture of any rewards earned.\n5. Before revenue airdrops are distributed, analysis of the free-floating MIST supply will be undertaken and distributed according to the threshold levels laid out in the table below. Establishing which threshold has been reached will be performed on a monthly basis. The Alchemist Council will monitor participation in the rewards programs and reserves the right to make adjustments to the thresholds and splits within it in order to promote a healthy balance between MIST-WETH LPs and single-sided MIST stakers.\n6. Governance will be limited to individuals participating in either CHAD Rewards program (Staking LP or Staking MIST) and will be proportionally split between these two groups based on the amount of revenue received. For example, if CHAD LP stakers are receiving 75% of the allotted revenue for stakers and CHAD MIST stakers are only receiving 25% of the revenue then CHAD LP stakers will have 3x the governance power. If both groups were receiving 50% of allotted revenues (equal split) then they would have the same governance power.\n\nThe following are the proposed single-sided staking levels to unlock the revenue redirection from CHAD Rewards for LPs to CHAD Stakers Rewards. This can be thought of as a coordination game between single-side MIST stakers. The Based Alchemist Games (BAGs) have four levels that lead up to the climax of the game (ie. max rewards per % of free-floating MIST staked).\n\n|BAG Levels|% of free-floating MIST staked in Crucibles|% of revenue airdropped to CHAD LPs|% of revenue airdropped to CHAD Stakers|\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |\n|Default|0 - 29.99|47.5|2.5|\n|1st Base|30 - 44.99|45|5|\n|2nd Base|45 - 59.99|42.5|7.5|\n|3rd Base|60 - 69.419|35|15|\n|4th Base|> 69.420|25|25|\n\nThe full proposal can be viewed at: https://discourse.alchemist.wtf/t/mip-1-mist-tokenomics-a-proposed-catalyst-for-growth/118\n\nAfter passing polling within the Discourse with overwhelming support in favor, the proposal is now moving to a snapshot vote.\n\n**Voting Process**\n\nMIST - All MIST tokens you hold in your wallet and/or Crucible added together.\nMIST/WETH LP - Your liquidity provision tokens equated to the number of MIST tokens, e.g. 1 MIST/WETH LP = 59 MIST.\n\nThis means that token holders and liquidity providers are treated equally and are all able to vote no matter if they hold their coins in a Crucible or wallet. The vote will be conducted quadratically, allowing users to spread their voting power as they see fit.\n",

Mainly, the Council will be tasked with: reviewing the performance and budgets of existing projects, approving new projects for incubation, and making the final decision on anything that relates to the Alchemist ecosystem. The Council serves as the delegated voice for Alchemist community members, and as such it will work on any matter that serves the community’s interests.\n\n\n## Voting Process\n\nThe Council consists of 5 members and serves a 6 month term. All 5 members will be voted into the Council this term, unlike the previous term. New voting strategies give us the ability to offer full inclusiveness of users LP positions and MIST holdings within a single proposal, instead of limiting voting to one or the other. You will be able to vote with any combination of the following assets no matter if they are in your wallet and/or Crucible:\n\n**MIST** - All MIST tokens you hold in your wallet and/or Crucible added together.\n**MIST/WETH LP** - Your liquidity provision tokens equated to the number of MIST tokens, e.g. 1 MIST/WETH LP = 59 MIST.\n\nThis means that token holders and liquidity providers are treated equally and are all able to vote no matter if they hold their coins in a Crucible or wallet. The vote will be conducted quadratically, allowing users to spread their voting power as they see fit.\n\n\nThe Ethereum network snapshot for calculating a user's MIST and MIST/WETH LP balances was taken at block number **[15259747](https://etherscan.io/block/15259747)** to coincide with the time when Alchemist Council Applications were closed for entry (12am UTC, August 2nd, 2022).\n\n\n### Note\n\nNominations were open to everyone who has been a part of the Alchemist community in the last 3 months including product owners as mentioned previously. Where a product owner has been nominated for the council a note will be provided below for transparency.\n\nIf elected, product owners are required to abstain from voting on any decisions made about the product they lead. Additionally, all council members must agree to and sign the Alchemist code of conduct to ensure they act in a manner that reflects the values of Alchemist, as well as being transparent with other council members when a potential conflict of interest may arise for them given the Council’s agenda. \n\n## Applicants\nListed below are the applicants' [Discord](https://discord.alchemist.wtf) user names and applications.

      "content": "**Background**\n\nNew founders and talent building within Alchemist is the fuel that powers our community. This reality organically emerged out of the chaos of no plan. In less than half a year we’ve built three very successful projects: Crucible, mistX, and Copper. It’s time to replicate this success at scale.\n\nThe Alchemist Council will play a critical role when incubating new projects. It will be responsible for deciding whether new venture proposals will receive funding, and whether funding should continue for existing projects.\n\nThe council will be made up of 5 elected members and a special founder’s role for @thegostep. Each Alchemist Council will come up for reelection every 6 months. To bootstrap the Council we will initiate it with three seniors, and then run a community vote for the 2 remaining spots based on the [Council applications](https://blog.alchemist.wtf/the-alchemist-council-618a54937fbc) we received from within the community.\n\nThe Senior Alchemists will then work to onboard the newly elected council members and continue iterating on our governance structure until it is brought to a refined state. For more information regarding the initial set of outlined responsibilities for the Alchemist Council please refer to the following post: [The Alchemist Council](https://blog.alchemist.wtf/the-alchemist-council-618a54937fbc).\n\n**Voting**\n\nThe election will be for a 6 month term and will be conducted using the [quadratic voting](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-quadratic-voting-4f81805d5a06) method within our [Crucible governance module](https://crucible.alchemist.wtf/governance). The top two community members will be elected to the council.\n\nAll council applicants that met the criteria of being active Alchemist Discord members for at least 6 months made the cut. The community members up for election are:\n\nCryptomando#9653 - [https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/917785024751874048/919018789369163808](https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/917785024751874048/919018789369163808)\n\nBLP 🥴👍#9281 - [https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/917785024751874048/919174927960129557](https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/917785024751874048/919174927960129557)\n\nSkaboo#7926 - [https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/917785024751874048/919316153438990346](https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/917785024751874048/919316153438990346)\n\nRook0412#6696 - [https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/917785024751874048/919969251262091325](https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/917785024751874048/919969251262091325)\n\nDjobs#7112 - [https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/917785024751874048/920107018159788083](https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/917785024751874048/920107018159788083)\n\nCryptographic#3015 - [https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/917785024751874048/924417372159373385](https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/917785024751874048/924417372159373385)\n\nCrypto420#0420 - [https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/917785024751874048/926531441712566322](https://discord.com/channels/812035504869998644/917785024751874048/926531441712566322)\n",

      "content": "\nAlchemist has recently started the long process of establishing a foundation towards creating a stronger voice for the community, making the community voice an integral part of the incubation process, allowing the Council to determine the support of which incubated projects receive from the Alchemist ecosystem.\n\nWe’ve also been determined to create more transparency within the operational activities by actively publishing reports, disclosures of our internal activities and results of certain initiatives.\n\nThese solutions, although a great step towards community lead initiatives, do not offer active inclusion in the ideas, discussions and establishment process of the proposals that have been actively decided on by internal teams, nor do they give insight into the current agreed actions and strategies that exist within the top structure of Alchemist. Due to this lack of insight and internalization of discussions, it has created the illusion that Alchemist has taken an idle position.\n\nIn the interests of safeguarding Alchemists success and future, not every discussion can typically be opened up to the public domain, however the majority of discussions and ideas that are actively being discussed internally can certainly be inclusive of the community.\n\nFor this reason we are proposing to establish a Discourse forum for Alchemist, which can be used to discuss current ideas, propose new ideas and create a sense of awareness and inclusion for those with Alchemist at interest.\n\nAlchemist teams can publicly post their ideas that pass their preliminary discussions, include the community in shaping and establishing the idea being proposed, whether those discussions are related to the everyday running, tokenomics, collaborations and other such aspects (where they do not overlap with the Councils responsibilities). The Council can also choose to use this tool to engage the community in some discussions to which they require a more broad understanding or opinion.\n\nThe Alchemist community can also use this as a tool to share their own ideas, start or take part in discussions on topics that are important to them.\n\nAlthough discussions may result in final core Proposals raised for voting, or voting within Discourse itself, the intention of the Discourse forum is not as a method of establishing binding proposals for topics which gain majority support, but instead for bridging the gap between Alchemist and the community.\n\nApart from the social interactions, Discourse would further act as a central store of information on current and past discussions, allowing Alchemist to maintain an organized approach to revisiting and reviving past discussions and ideas at the relevant time, helping mitigate the potential loss of information where discussions internally are happening at a fast pace.\n\nIf this proposal was to be approved, we would look to establish the Discourse forum within 7 days, followed by an announcement on how to access the platform and participate.\n\nA few examples of Discourse being utilised in the space:\n\nYearn Finance https://gov.yearn.finance/\nOlympus DAO https://forum.olympusdao.finance/\nBankless DAO https://forum.bankless.community/ \nETH Research https://ethresear.ch/ \n\n> Voting on this proposal is weighted by your $MIST/⚗️ token holding within your wallet and Crucible. This is as the Discourse tool will be open to the use of all community members, giving all interested parties an opportunity to participate in this proposal.",

      "title": "Create a new 80/20 MIST-ETH pool on Balancer using Alchemist Multisig funds",
      "content": "**Advantages tl;dr**\n\n1. A capital efficient way to provide Copper launches with the opportunity to use MIST as a collateral token, and enable launch participants to use MIST as a currency. \n2. Experiment with a novel liquidity provision mechanism that is meant to better protect MIST liquidity providers against impermanent loss.\n3. The reduction of impermanent loss effects within an 80/20 pool could result in a significantly higher number of MIST locked through LP provision by the Alchemist community as a result of pool’s utility (fees generated) in the context of Copper.\n\n\n## Advantages of an 80/20 Balancer pool for Alchemist community members\n\n\n### Increase the utility of MIST by enabling projects bullish on the Alchemist community to launch MIST fund raises on Copper\n\nCopper[ https://copperlaunch.com](https://copperlaunch.com) is a fair launch platform built by Alchemist. Projects launching through Copper can currently only raise funds in tokens that have liquidity within the Balancer protocol. ETH, DAI, and USDC are currently enabled on the platform. Many Alchemist community members have requested MIST as a collateral currency on Copper. Unfortunately, MIST doesn’t currently have a liquidity pool on Balancer, but the creation of an 80/20 MIST-ETH pool would enable this use case.\n\nThe advantages of it being an 80/20 pool is that it can be bootstrapped by the Alchemist Multisig in a very capital efficient way. We would only need 20 ETH and 2450 MIST to bootstrap it with nearly 400K USD of liquidity, and the slippage associated with selling enough MIST to get 20 ETH is negligible (0.6%).\n\n\n\n### Entice passive MIST HODLers to participate in MIST liquidity provision and further lock up MIST\n\n80/20 pools are a great solution for communities that want to scale because they provide a way to reduce impermanent loss while also seeking liquidity gains. 80% of the pool would be held in MIST, while the other 20% of the pool would be held in ETH.\n\nThe 80/20 pools solve the problem of misaligned intentions between community token holders and liquidity providers looking to make a profit. In addition to what has been previously covered on impermanent loss, it should be noted that the “classical” 50/50 pool exacerbates a split between two groups of community’s token holders, which are always present when a project is launched. On one side, there are believers ready to HODL for the long term dreaming about a moon-landing upside; on the other, liquidity providers who cannot stand to have tokens left in a wallet that don’t generate any form of revenue.\n\nLet’s look at a couple of different scenarios that illustrate these realities.\n\n\n#### Scenario 1: ETH increases in value after a community member provides LP\n\n![Scenario 1](https://i.imgur.com/8UbCT2I.png)\n\nIn this common scenario, when the liquidity is concentrated in a 50/50 pool, tension might arise within the community. Liquidity providers could view growth as a form of risk, because any sudden price change may produce impermanent loss for their pools. The best outcome for them is that tokens in their pool continue to trade within a tight range.\n\n\n#### Scenario 2: MIST increases in value after LP provision\n\n![Scenario 2](https://i.imgur.com/hPV8q4l.png)\n\nLong term holders are reticent of putting their assets at work, as they expect the token to prepare for lift-off at any time. On top of impermanent loss concerns, they are reasonably concerned that farming with a 50/50 ratio would erase part of their potential earnings.\n\nThe main positive effect of the 80/20 ratio is inducing HODLers to pool their tokens. In the case of stagnating price, HODLers benefit from passive pool income, while they would lose less compared to a 50/50 pool in the case of a significant price drop (for impermanent loss). Finally, in usual market conditions, HODLers would not perform much better than 80/20 LPs. 80/20 pools are a lower-risk way to still have a foot in the door for improving liquidity.\n\n\n### Lock more MIST in healthy, profitable LP provision\n\nGiven that the 80/20 MIST/ETH pool on Balancer will have immediate utility when it comes to enabling the use of MIST as a collateral and currency on Copper, it could potentially generate a strong amount of fees for LP providers, further increasing the pool’s value proposition.\n\nAn additional benefit of having the liquidity on Balancer is that their Vault architecture will result in a considerable amount of gas saved for LP providers. In other DEXs where token accounting is paired with pool logic, multi-hop trading (A->B->C) can become costly since ERC20 tokens must be transferred at each hop. For Balancer Vaults this problem is eliminated.\n\n",

      "title": " Core proposal: product revenue utilization",
      "content": "\n## The vote\nIn just 6 months, the Alchemist ecosystem has incubated several core products. MistX has already started generating revenue, and other/future products may also generate significant revenues.\n\nSimilar to the $mist inflation, 50% of the revenue from these products will be deposited directly into the Aludel to reward LPs within the ecosystem. This vote is to determine how the rest of these revenues are used.\n\n#### The 3 voting options for utilization of product revenues are as follows:\n\n__Option A:__\n - 50% to Aludel rewards\n - 50% profit share for active team members\n\n__Option B:__\n - 50% to Aludel rewards\n - 40% profit share for active team members\n - 10% to multisig\n\n__Option C:__\n - 50% to Aludel rewards\n - 30% profit share for active team members\n - 20% to multisig\n\n## Motivation\nInflation is currently set to 1% every 2 weeks, which is distributed as follows:\n - 50% to Aludel reward pool \n - 25% to $MIST community multisig \n - 25% to $MIST treasury\n\nThe community multisig portion of inflation has so far funded the development of all current core products, as well as the building out of the ecosystem (community rewards, marketing, design, operations, etc). Future products will likely be funded in a similar manner with the aim of teams becoming self-reliant rather than depending on inflation to fund growth and operating costs.\n\nAlthough the inflation rate is configurable, there is likely little appetite to reduce it in the foreseeable future due to its huge success in growing the community and attracting founder-level talent to build within the ecosystem. Incentivizing founders to build products that feed value back into the Aludel is critical for generating ongoing value to $mist LPs.\n\nAs a community-driven project, it is up to the $mist liquidity providers to determine the preferred structure. However, there are some important points to consider regarding the different options:\n\n - Diverting some product revenues back to the multisig reduces the reliance on inflation and provides a flow-on effect for the funds to be utilized to develop more products and build out the ecosystem. However, it also lessens the multisig’s economic interest in MIST which may have longer-term incentive implications.\n - Revenue distributed back to the multisig can be used to build a stablecoin fund without selling inflation-derived $mist from treasury/multisig\n - If product teams are to retain the full 50% of product revenue, Alchemist is far more likely to attract and retain founder-level talent and to incentivize these founders to increase the profitability of their products. This in turn is likely to provide more value to the ecosystem and in turn higher revenues to be deposited into the aludel rewards program.\n - A simpler revenue utilization structure is more conducive to scaling the size of the Alchemist ecosystem by reducing the operations and coordination overhead.\n\n## Voting Mechanics\nEvery crucible holder can vote once for either option A, B, or C. \n\nEach vote will be weighted by the amount of subscribed LP.\n\nThe vote will run for 11 days and conclude at 12:00 UTC on September 12\n\n\nAs a core proposal, the decision of the community will be binding. This will help lead the way to incentivize future products to be incubated in the Alchemist ecosystem. We thank our community for their guidance and for joining us in the ongoing voyage to find the philosopher’s stone.\n\n\n\n",
