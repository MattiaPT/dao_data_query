This contractor agreement also keeps things definitively transactional and accountable.\n\n## PROCESS\nBill Gains from the Lorn and FR community will work with Josiah to build, customize, and implement tracker bots to cover sales, burns, meta data changes, and location staking, with one bot in reserve. The contractor will solely receive the full sum of proposal ask.\n\n## TIMELINE\nWorks begins immediately after proposal pass.\n\n## OVERALL COST\nThis initiative asks for a one time payment of .15 eth.\n\nPayment will be sent to 0x165a79430B2654F1339aD2861fEDdd2e11ca3f9D and directly distributed to the developer’s wallet when bots are complete.\n\n## CONCLUSION\nProviding the discord with these features enhances and facilitates our community experience.

      "title": "Finish The WAGDIE World Map",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks to fund the completion of the WAGDIE world map, originally conceptualized and designed by Rolu, a well-known community member. The finished map will be released as a CC0 art asset for community use. The Two are unable to fund this project directly and are bringing it to the community for a decision.\n\n## Rationale\n\n1. The map is currently unfinished, and its completion is crucial for fully visualizing the WAGDIE world.\n2. The map's detail has increased significantly over the course of WAGDIE's development.\n3. Continued work is no longer within the scope of the original agreement between The Two and Rolu.\n4. Funding this project with Conclave funds may be our only opportunity to see the world's visuals through to completion.\n\n## Process\n\n1. The Conclave will fund the project with 2 ETH, to be sent directly to Rolu.\n2. Rolu will complete approximately one map piece every month.\n3. Finished map assets will be released in a downloadable format for community use as they are completed.\n4. A full map will be released once all pieces are complete.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- Total project duration: Approximately 6 months\n- Delivery: One piece of the map released each month\n\n## Cost\n\nTotal cost: 2 ETH\n\n## Scope of Work\n\nThe project will complete the following areas:\n- 5 unfinished mainland areas\n- 1 undisclosed area outside the Forsaken Lands proper\n\n## Payment Details\n\n- Recipient: Rolu\n- Payment address: roluart.eth `0x4F0EceDCd73dA0315134741d9D3830B08fE32e95`\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFunding the completion of the WAGDIE world map will provide the community with a valuable asset for world-building. By releasing the map as CC0, we ensure that all community members can freely use and build upon this piece of WAGDIE lore.",

      "title": "Fund WAGDIE Weekly",
      "content": "WAGDIE Weekly has been operating for over 2 years on a weekly basis. It is the most consistent active avenue for officiated WAGDIE content. This includes over 20+ episodes in the recent full-production style, which has included custom scripting, vocal recording, full audio production, contract interactions, gameplay designs, and more… If you’ve participated, you know what it is.\n\nThis has all been accomplished with a dedicated 4 hrs per week to the project since vacating the social side. I had given myself this strict limitation to assure that I put time and energy back into the rest of my very neglected life, and enterprise. At my peak, I was operating in WAGDIE world more than 40+ hrs per week.\n\nAfter a few months in low-power mode, I have recovered some and rebuilt new avenues of interest, and productivity. WAGDIE Weekly has persisted as a hobby, but the product has suffered for it while my focus is elsewhere.\n\nThere is a lot more to operating successful campaigns than simply producing them. It requires prodding, goading, and instigation. There must be risk and reward, as well as socially integrated stories. All of this requires more consistent and observant game-mastery than simple module production. This cannot be adequately covered in just 4 hrs per week.\n\nThe theory that the game of WAGDIE could persist solely by organic community-developed content is a fallacy. Nearly every spring of participation and creation has come as response to officiated content. Without dedicated individuals crafting playable content for others in The Forsaken Lands, the world is null.\n\nSo, I entreat you to tempt my return. I have reached a point of stability, and am willing to offer 20 hrs per week to the project, in production of WAGDIE Weekly episodes, high-level community management, and necessary contracy / frontend development required to produce a more robust and engaging calendar of content for WAGDIE.\n\nWeekly Schedule\nShow Production - 10hr\nUpping my production time to more than double its current will allow for longer, more robust episodes of greater quality. These have been about 5-10 minutes, but with the additional time, we would be able to target 20-30 mins per episode.\n\nThe advantage of this is to explore some stories in greater detail, but also to provide multiple simultaneous storylines, pending player involvement/desire.\n\nDungeon Production - 3hr\nOnce per month, I would like to deliver a more extensively produced Dungeon Event. Typically, these include a large group of Pilgrims venturing through encounters, each with their own puzzle, narrative, choice, or combat solution.\n\nThese events take substantially more planning and coordination, so setting aside a few hrs per week to build them would make these incredible events feasible on a routine basis.\n\nAs for my dungeon-design pedigree… I don’t remember if I ever revealed my involvements in prior dungeon developments, but… iykyk… :wink:\n\nOffice Hours (Mon-Fri) - 5hr\nAn open collaboration hour, once per weekday, to coordinate and build with various community members who wish to more directly or covertly influence the storyline, or involve themselves. This will take place over Discord in the tavern, and across private chats.\n\nThis will also be the time I dedicate to maintaining the community features which have been languishing in my absence. Upkeep and update to the reporting bots, conclave executions, and various behind-the-scenes levers that keep the pieces moving.\n\nMiscellaneous - 2hr\nAs events progress, they will require development of contracts, front-ends, tokens, character updates, locations, and other elements that make the experience more than just words. These things take time to develop, and having a few small hrs per week set aside, means that we will have the time to create more these interactive assets.\n\nI must stress that these few hrs are not enough to build massive or complex interactive elements, but small things on the scale of Acolytes could be possible periodically.\n\nFor this to be worth my time and effort, I am requesting 10 ETH distributed at 1 ETH per month from September 2024 to June 2025 concluding just after the 3-year anniversary.\n\nThe ETH will be held in a gnosis, with @Atriox and @Icculus as signors, requiring all 3 parties to verify the distribution.\n\nMy plans post-LORN had been to do this and more with the support of its revenue. Giving myself to WAGDIE as a full-time job would have been no issue. With its incomplete mint, that became impossible.\n\nI hope you still have interest in The Forsaken Lands, and enjoy playing. Despite the quieting across our world (and all of ETH), I still believe we have something tremendous and unique.\n\nWAGDIE will probably never thrive… but we can have fun with it in the meantime.\n\n– Offling",

WAGDICE Legacy fully enables the everyday user to formulate, customize, execute and display roll based narratives while alongside high quality WAGDIE art and voice lines. As a one stop shop for all dungeon, tournament, and interactive quests, it will be an enduring legacy tool decked out in the visual and audio lore of WAGDIE, highly versatile and useable long after the cycle has past.\n\nPROCESS\n\nKey features Josiah, OxG and cmoorelabs are focusing on includes:\n\n*Token-gated website with high quality and user friendly medieval fantasy UI interface\n* Scalable dice roll options, on and off-chain\n* Animated Flourishes\n* Text and image upload features to achieve a fully customizable LARP experience. Name your event, exhibit special rules, site locations, and character bios!\n* Stored History to document and highlight previous events\n* Fully immersive WAGDIE aesthetic featuring hand-drawn core characters and custom voice lines, website soundtrack options and sound effects.\n\nTIMELINE\n\nWorks begins immediately after funding is received, with the goal of making WAGDIE legacy available to members in 45 days from project start. We’re prioritizing this to make it accessible for immediate community to use for tournaments and other imminent DnD formatted adventures so an expedient conclave process is crucial especially regarding the current value of ETH.\n\nOVERALL COST\n\nWe are asking for 2 allotments of 2 ETH for this initiative, one paid at proposal passing and the other at product delivery; funds will be sent to 0x165a79430B2654F1339aD2861fEDdd2e11ca3f9D. Costs include labor for web development, site assets, art and audio production, and post launch maintenance costs.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nEager to create a lasting, highly usable tool that everyone can use and everyone can benefit from that also cements and celebrates the legacy of WAGDIE in a way it deserves.",

As we release episode 7 this week, next week will be the finale.\n\nDuring the first 8 episodes, i felt like some things went great; while others could use some impovement.\n\nI come to you with the proposal to continue, change, and expand, on the series & workflow.\n\nThe V2 series will feature longer episodes, around 3 minutes, with each episode releasing every 2 weeks.\n\nV2 seeks to improve on the [PILOT] series by :\n\nIMPROVING STORYTELLING : Build tension / comedic timing & setting with much more time for B-REEL and jokes in and outside WAGDIE holders. (longer episodes/ more time for editing helps)\n\nActual LORE & EVENTS from the Story of WAGDIE that creates a body of work, from start to finish, that is cohesive for outsiders to learn about our story.\n\nIMPROVING 3D ASSETS : With more time i am able to deliver more accurate 3D assets and locations, i personally believe this could be super valuable for future project community projects.\n\nMARKETING : Each EPISODE , will be sliced into scenes under 1 minute to use for TIKTOK/ youtube shorts, with a more meme-focused context. (also to be used as GIFS). We will also focus on targeting larger communities outside of the world of wagdie. (THINK : LOWPOLY MEMES, FANTASY, HOUSE OF THE DRAGON, CRYPTO. )\n\nProduction of the videos will require 0.2 ETH investment per video. Paid on delivery of each final cut.\n\nWith a runway of 10 videos, this will require 2 eth from The Conclave.\nThis will be paid out over the course of 20 weeks.\n\nThe first video will be released on 15 september.\n\nFunds will be held by gnosis safe 0x33f822E8D1C5a37b75A3687C1Ad7eBC0fe316505 and be co-signed by [@kingoffling](http://twitter.com/kingoffling) and [@atriox](twitter.com/bussin0x/) (bussin) at each release.\n\nIf you have any feedback feel free to let it know below.\n![wagdie-shorts-v2-animation.gif](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQXynHtfPCXNNssZJWcggGwUDUBUHmDfn6hv3y8pLHDsY/wagdie-shorts-v2-animation.gif)",

      "content": "**ABSTRACT**\n\nAn initiative to collect and curate WAGDIE's original content: episodic spaces and narrative drops on YouTube. \n\n**RATIONALE**\n\n1. To preserve the mainline lore and its long winding sequence of events in purest form. \n\n2. Increase viewer exposure and ease of access through curation on YouTube. \n\n\n**PROCESS**\n\nA year ago, I started a YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@wagdiestory/videos) to showcase the rich audio-visual creations of the WAGDIE Project. The original narrative drops posted by the main account comprised a good part of this [initiative](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9sDwnBwlNMg3fPONTYmTT1-wdkw9vzJp&si=7kgGzX9V3bQAD-xA). \n\nWith the bull, I wish to restart this process to preserve the entire narrative of the WAGDIE project in its purest form. Hosting the videos on YouTube allows for much more exposure and access than on Twitter and facilitates content digestion much more efficiently for newcomers or chronic Stalwart Researchers like myself. \n\n\n**TIMELINE**\n\nWAGDIE is coming up on two years now so there is a deep well of content to mine for. Work will begin as soon as the proposal passes with a goal minimum of one WAGDIE Originals video per week. \n\nFrom Gregor's First Meeting, the Trial of the Crow, Saga of the Festival Tournament, Molten Lands of Turlo, Ritual of Detriti, Battle of Her Church, Path of the Burrows, Advent of the World Maker, Journey to the Southern Plains, The Mysterious Corpse and Plague of the Headless, The Glutton and Astaroth and Goldbeard's Challenge, I expect there will be well over 50 videos to catch up to where the narrative is today, March 14th, 2024. \n\n**OVERALL COST**\n\nI am asking for .8 ETH to cover the labor of this committed endeavor,  a process that includes harvesting all the content, crafting individual thumbnails images, and creating imaginative AI assisted art to accompany the audio exclusive episodic spaces. \n\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nLet's preserve and properly showcase the rich narrative productions of the WAGDIE Project.  Thank you for taking the time to read!\n\n![Untitled_Artwork 5|690x388](upload://e2n2KFMr3BFZcrOl24GtJQthilG.jpeg)\n\n![IMG_5668|690x337](upload://2NR42BYShnFzWJekVkfR7ASCmT2.png)",

      "title": "Proposal: Continued Support for You Will Not Survive",
      "content": "TLDR\n\nDethsoft would like the Conclave’s continued support while we head into early access for You Will Not Survive, by giving us more time to polish and test over the next 6-7 months.\n\nWe as a team believe that we have shown our dedication and commitment with daily and weekly posts/updates about the game, quarterly testing of new and expanded features, and detailed and transparent finances.\n\nWhat started as a Vampire Survivor clone has grown into an in-depth Action Roguelite that will stand on its own legs within the Indie Gaming scene.\n\n- Weapons & Items showcasing mainline lore\n- Map UI that utilizes the art to its fullest\n- NPCs & Enemies based on existing characters\n- Character Classes of story-based Pilgrims\n- Addictive Game and System Mechanics that keep players coming back for one more run\n- Steam Page Launch\n\nOur team feels this is just the beginning, we see You Will Not Survive packed with dozens upon dozens of NPCs, items, weapons, and enemies that can tell a story to many that few know now.\n\nThis year we plan to release You Will Not Survive as a demo on Steam in late Spring and then into Early Access on Steam after participating in the June or October 2024 Steamfest.\n\nCurrently, we are working on completing our initial vision of the game which includes:\n\n- Revamping our weapon/attack system\n- In-game currency/system (DEATH)\n- Ultimate Weapon System Completion (Charging via bullet absorption + DEATH collection)\n- 4 New NPCs\n- 5 New Weapons\n- 10 New Items\n- 10 New Enemies + Bosses\n- New Dungeon, The Church of Her\n- Unlock Tree\n- A Plethora of QoL Updates + Additions\n\nWe plan to do 1-2 more playtests with the community before pushing to a broader audience to ensure a quality and well-designed game.\n\n2024 Budget Breakdown\n\nLead Dev Salary - 2k/month (Rama)\nGame Designer/Director Salary - 2k/month (b33f)\nConcept Artist/Book Artist & Designer - 300/month (brenon64)\nIn-game Sprite Art - 300/month (rex)\nTotal: 15k USD\nThese funds will allow us the time of 4-6 months to get YWNS into a sellable state to generate revenue.\n\nProposed Transactions\n\nWe are asking the Conclave for $15,000 in total to help us reach our goal of Early Access.\n\nMultisig\n\nWe will be using the same multisig that was initially created for our first proposal:\n\nUpdated Deliverables\nDethsoft will hold 1-2 more open playtests on itch.io before going live with our Steam demo in late Spring\n\nWe will use that demo to participate in either the June or October Steamfest and then release You Will Not Survive into Early Access afterward featuring all demo content + The Church of Her Dungeon and unlockables.\n\nFollowing our Early Access release we will continue updating and completing the game on Steam until version 1.0 is ready.\n\nVersion 1.0 will feature:\n\n- 6 Total Dungeons\n- The Abyss (True Roguelite Mode)\n- 30+ Weapons\n- 50+ Items\n- 15 NPCs\n- 50+ Enemies & Bosses\n\nRevenue Model\n\nThe revenue model will stay mostly the same, we will sell the game on Steam/Epic and itch.io initially for an MSRP of $12.99 USD for the base game, and we will have DLC packs for $2-3 USD for future updates.\n\nPorting to the Nintendo Switch would be our first priority if we see the demand and financial return.\n\nThe initial distribution of the game will be controlled by Rama and b33f, unless we can strike a deal with a game publisher.\n\nThe team’s LLC will handle all revenue generated by the game unless further publishing or licensing deals are struck in the long term.\n\nDethsoft will pay back the Conclave 30% of all profits on the You Will Not Survive base game after marketplace cuts & taxes until the $75000 is paid back in full. After that time % payback will drop to 15% in perpetuity.\n\nCC0 Ethos\n\nAfter our 1.0 release, we intend to release all art assets we have personally created for the game as CC0 assets to be used however anyone would like.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn the short timespan of 1 year the Dethsoft team has built out a more robust gaming experience then most/any project in the space that has brought in millions to do what we’ve done with 60k.\n\nYou Will Not Survive is a product that can be worn and shown proudly by the community, and it is, it is truly something that excites and interests those on the outside.\n\nOur Success is the conclaves and everyone’s success, more funds now will allow us the time to polish and create a game that is worthy of widespread reception and recognition.\n\nThank you for your time!\n\n-Dethsoft",

      "title": " Fund a wirtual tabletop role-playing game set in the Forsaken Lands",
      "content": "**CONCEPT**\n\n*Occult Occurrences* is a virtual tabletop role-playing game set in the Forsaken Lands, a world where *We Are All Going to Die*. This will be an interactive adventure that builds upon the entertainment experience presented by the @wagdie_eth twitter account, with the addition of dice-rolling mechanics and other aspects inspired by classic RPG rule systems.\n\n**SPECIFICS**\n\nThis proposal will fund the creation of the following content:\n\n- A twitter account that hosts at least two recorded audio storytelling segments in the style of @wagdie_eth\n\n- No less than eight visual components; including a map, journal, and environmental scenes\n\n- A Discord server hosting \"play-by-post\" style interactive text narratives for token holders to participate in\n\n- Live audio narration and dice-rolling to resolve some climactic sequences of major story points\n\n- A new Token of Concord\n\n- A digital compilation of game rules, mechanics, lore and art\n\nThis proposal also establishes, through partial or temporary funding:\n\n- An original soundtrack\n\n- Website design with limited blockchain functionality\n\n- Premium Midjourney subscription\n\n- Discord Nitro subscription\n\n**TIMELINE**\n\nThe adventure is anticipated to start approximately a month after the passage of the proposal and is estimated to run for 6 weeks. The pace of updates to the Discord server and Twitter account will vary, but participants can expect multiple developments to the story each week. The author maintains communication with the project developers for lore guidance and this may impact the rate of game activity.\n\n\n**OVERALL COST**\n\nArt - 1.1 ETH\nWebsite - 0.55 ETH\nMusic - 0.15 ETH\nSubscriptions, fees, misc. - 0.2 ETH\n\nThe 2 ETH from the treasury will be sent to the proposal author's address for further distribution:\noccultoccurrences.eth\n0x0ec23186f8b9e62db49eb3c46ef76130d1821e0d",

      "content": "### Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks to renew the  funding for WAGDIE Weekly, which has had 6 months of successful Twitters Spaces / Podcast episodes since its inception. In addition, this proposal seeks to update the terms to reflect the reduction from 3 hosts to 2.\n\nWAGDIE Weekly is a scheduled Twitter Spaces and syndicated podcast across multiple platforms, hosted by @KingOffling and @josiah.peace with at-will community member involvement.\n\nThe show has been hosted every Tuesday at 8PM EST on https://twitter.com/wagdieweekly for more than 26 consecutive weeks, and this proposal seeks to fund it for an additional 24 episodes (bringing to 50 total).\n\n### **Motivation**\n\nThe spaces provides an easy recap opportunity for community members who don't have time to engage with the project at all levels. It also serves as a gathering point for the WAGDIE community to discuss its independent initiatives, and various happenings apart from the core of the project.\n\n### **Rationale**\n\nWAGDIE is an incredibly expansive experience and having this spaces / podcast format makes things a lot easier to digest for those with less time. It has been quite successful since its outset, and will continue to be a valuable aspect of the community's development.\n\n### **Specifications**\n\nTwitter for the live show.\nPodbean for distribution across Spotify, Apple, and major podcasting services.\n\n### **Implementation** \n\nWAGDIE Weekly has already produced 27 episodes and will continue to operate without change. @KingOffling and @josiah.peace create notes for their episode throughout the week, and then host a Twitter Spaces for approximately 1hr on Tuesdays at 8PM EST. Sometime after completion, the show is ripped from Twitter, edited, and sent to syndication.\n\n### **Timeline**\n\nThe show already exists, and will continue uninterrupted.\n\n### **Overal Cost**\n\nWe are requesting $75 per person, per episode ($150 total per episode).\nThis increase per host is to reflect the increased workload since losing one co-host.\n\nThis proposal requires $3500 to execute the planned 24 episodes.\n\nThe entire amount shall be distributed to wagdiepodcast.eth for holding.\nHalf will be distributed to hosts at approval, half after episode 44 is complete.",

He attended the live event during NFT NYC 2022 where a handful of us were blessed to meet him in person. Of particular note, on June 18th, Entitez single handily launched wagdie.gg, a community marketplace with zero trading fees. \n\nThis proposal is a way for us to thank and commemorate him while providing IRL support to his loved ones who remain. \n\n**Specifications** | \n\nAcquire all of the WAGDIE assets in his primary wallet, [https://opensea.io/entitez, ](https://opensea.io/entitez) for 2 eth.

This proposal for community appointed representatives aligns The Conclave with these ideals.\n\nThe addition of the USDC payments will streamline our reward structure for contributors and replaces the previous WAGDIE NFT payments. This reduces keeper overhead and allows reps to decide how to spend their earned rewards.\n\n### Representative Responsibilities\nHold signor authority for Conclabe Gnosis Safe: 0xa4aAFeCCCCBE6FcEb304d8e1dCA3ce7aF66ba3Ce\nMeet regularly with other representatives to discuss active and potential Wagdie Idea Proposals (WIP)\nChoose a community member to receive a Conclave Bell at the conclusion of term\nRepresentative Rewards\nConclave Bell at the conclusion of term\n100 USDC per representative\n\n8 Nominated (in order of appearance):\n\n• **King Offling**\n• **Brennen.eth**\n• **Pandira**\n• **OccultOccurrences**\n• **TheGoldenEel**\n• **Coldworld**\n• **HerSilence**\n• **Bus**\n\n### Overall Cost\n600 USDC\n",

      "title": "We Are All Going To Die - You Will Not Survive",
      "content": "WAGDIE: *You Will Not Survive* is a F2P roguelike RPG mobile video game that lets players and holders take control of their WAGDIE characters. With engaging gameplay, addictive leveling and powering, and a way to play through the entire WAGDIE story, this will become the premium product for the WAGDIE project. To deliver version 1.0 of this game, we are asking for **$60,000.**\n\n### **Who We Are**\nRama and b33f are long-time WAGDIE holders and experienced game devs. Rama has created a plethora of art and games for various projects that are beautiful, tight, and fun to play. B33f has spent the past year as the game director of EtherOrcs Dungeons, an exciting turn-based RPG with over 200 weekly players; prior to web3, he worked in film and video games for Vice, Kotaku, ESPN, and other media outlets. Both profoundly understand the WAGDIE story and what makes games fun and compelling to play.\n\n### Why a WAGDIE videogame?\nVideogames and NFTs seem to be the perfect match, but the space still needs to realize and execute the core principles of what makes games **FUN** and sustainable game ecosystems. We put gaming and fun first; making a **GOOD** game is what's most important. \n\nWith WAGDIE: *You Will Not Survive*, we plan to make a compelling web3 gaming experience and a wide-funnel web2 game for those outside NFTs to play and enjoy!\n\nWAGDIE pfps come alive, and holders are granted in-game benefits befitting their status as WAGDIE holders. Experience the story of WAGDIE in a whole new way!\n\nThe Conclave would receive *30% of all game sales initially*. Once 100% of the funds of the 60k have been recovered, *the conclave rate drops to 15% in perpetuity.* \n\nWe want to leave the door open for a formal game publisher to enter and offer porting services, marketing, the mobile market, licensing copyright, and more.\n\nWe reserve the right to make other funding agreements with various blockchains, publishers, and distributors for the continued success of the game.\n\nIf a new publisher or investor wishes to make a deal that would require more equity, the game devs reserve the right to have the conclave \"bought out\" if required to execute a new deal that is more advantageous. \n\n**Why we’re doing this**\n* We are massive fans of WAGDIE and web3\n* We believe that the WAGDIE story is best told in a game format, relive the Battle of the Church, The Crows Trial, and venture into the Primordial Lands\n* We can pioneer and position WAGDIE as *the* Lore and Game-based ecosystem and community\n* This will create the base game and allow us to continue to build and expand a living-breathing WAGDIE game for years to come.\n* We want to utilize previously made WAGDIE assets like The World of WAGDIE map and truly bring it to life.\n\n**Budget**\n\nWe are asking for 60k USD to bring version 1.0 of WAGDIE: *You Will Not Survive* to market. 40k USD to be paid initially, with 20k USD coming after the playable beta/early access debuts in 4–6 months.\n\n**Development Milestones**\nFebruary - Base Game concept completion with:\n- 4 Initial Character Classes\n- 15 Base Weapons\n- 10 Base Items\n- Elemental Effects Systems\n- Chest Mechanics\n- Endless Mode Level 1 structure and scoring system\n\nMarch/April - Story Mode concept completion:\n- Integrate Spaces audio w/game effects and dialogue boxes to tell the story of WAGDIE\n- Complete the first level, \"The Burning of the Ape\"\n- Continue on to levels 2-67, \"The Stalwart Fortress\", \"Trial of the Crow\", \"Summoning of the Amalgam\", \"The Grand Tournament\", \"The Primordial Lands\", \"Yuria's Heart\"\n- Integrate World of WAGDIE map as the level selector\n- Title Screen\n\nApril/May - Leveling & Devotion to the 17 systems\n- Create and Implement meta-progression systems aligned w/story lore\n- Players will have the choice of Devoting themselves to 1 of the 17 to gain power\n- Introduce tech trees and new effects that align w/power of the 17\n\nMay/June - Abyss Mode & Beta Test\n- Create \"The Abyss\" which is a dungeon-style game mode w/micro battles (1/2 mins long)\n- Players start their journey at the surface, and most make it to The Serpent to win, fighting in several battles with various goals along the way\n- This is a roguelike dungeon mode combined with our existing gameplay loop\n- Release the game for Beta Test, token gate it for WAGDIE holders\n\nJune/July - Early Access Release/Server Integration\n- Work out backend and server verification/anti-cheat with SPY\n- Release an Early Access version of the game on Steam/Epic\n\nJuly/September - Continued development\n- Team will continue to work out bugs and fixes for the current Early Access game\n- Story, Abyss, Endless, and the leveling system will be refined and built out to a further extent.\n- Multiplayer/Battle Royale, the team will begin concepting and working on a multiplayer mode for the game as a stretch goal.\n\nOctober/November - Testing, Go Gold, Release\n- Team will on-board various community members to push and test the game\n- Game will go Gold in November for Version 1.0 Launch\n- Game will launch Version 1.0 in November on Steam/Epic and other PC game stores.\n\n2024 - Porting, Multiplayer, DLC\n- Ports to other platforms like mobile, console, and mac will begin\n- Multiplayer will be fleshed out and move into beta\n- New Story, Endless, Abyss, and Devotion tech trees will be sold as DLC\n\n\n**Budget Breakdown**\n* Game Development — 40k USD (Rama & b33f)\n* Art & Music — 5k USD (Grant Holzter, EtherOrcs Soundtrack. Rolu & Rama for art)\n* Backend and Server Development — 5k USD\n* Smart Contract/Web3 Integration —5k USD (LookingforOwls)\n* Distribution/Marketing — 5k USD\n* **Total: 60k USD**\n\n**Revenue Model**\n\nWe will be taking the route of a web2-style game with a web3 offering down the line. This model would have an MSRP of $6.66 USD for the base game, and we would have DLC packs for $2-3 USD for future updates!\n\nWe would plan to release the game to Epic and Steam initially, with porting support to consoles if we can find the correct publisher services to enable that expansion.\n\nThe initial distribution of the game will be controlled by Rama and b33f, unless we can strike a deal with a game publisher.\n\nThe team's LLC will handle all revenue generated by the game unless further publishing or licensing deals are struck in the long term.\n\n### What is WAGDIE: You Will Not Survive\nWAGDIE: *You Will Not Survive* is a F2P Roguelike RPG that is playable on mobile devices. Players will play as their WAGDIE characters, fight monsters with auto-aim combat, level up in-game as the enemy Hordes crash in around them, earn in-game currency to spend on meta-progression power-ups, and get more characters.\n\nThere will be several game modes:\n* Story Mode (Play through the story of WAGDIE)\n* Endless Mode (Play until you DIE, try for the highest score)\n* Abyss Mode (Battle through micro-encounters to reach and defeat The Serpent)\n* PvP ( Play the same map with up to 4 other players, may the best WAGDIE win)\n\nClose games in the genre would be Vampire Survivors, 20 Minutes Til Dawn, Rogue Genesia, Tiny Rogues, and Hades.\n\n### Deliverables\nAfter 4–6 months of receiving conclave funds, we will release the early access beta of the game exclusively to WAGDIE holders to test and play.\n\nOnce the beta has been delivered, four months after, we will release the full Version 1.0 mobile version of the game for mass consumption.\n\n**Benefits to WAGDIE holders and Conclave**\n* Premium access to the game world, free in-game currency, and the ability to play as and level up your characters\n* A wide-funnel f2p game that will impact people outside the NFT space\n* New ways to get people exposed to WAGDIE\n* A Revenue model for the Conclave\n* A module to utilize in partnerships with other NFT projects\n\n**Project Updates**\n* Monthly Spaces with the community\n* Bi-Weekly Mediums on in-game progress\n\n**Closing**\n\nThe release of WAGDIE: *You Will Not Survive* is just the beginning; we plan on maintaining and developing the game as the WAGDIE story continues and develops, adding characters and creatures to a living and breathing world!\n\nLink to Medium: https://medium.com/@b33feth/we-are-all-going-to-die-you-will-not-survive-2ba3c05132b1\n\nLink to Tech Demo: https://rama19886.itch.io/wagdie-ywns\n\nNote: *Current tech demo utilizes EtherOrcs Dungeon monsters for in-game enemies, weapons for in-game items, and music from the EtherOrcs soundtrack. This will not be the case in the future unless we receive full permissions from both the EtherOrcs team and WAGDIE conclave for integration.*",

      "content": "### **ABSTRACT**\nOrganize a week-long game jam competition that challenges the artists, musicians, designers, and developers within the community to come together and produce small proof-of-concept video games featuring WAGDIE content with prizes for the community's favourite creations.\n\n### **MOTIVATION**\nAs the community continues to seek new avenues to present the WAGDIE experience, and opportunities to generate saleable WAGDIE products, video games are a fantastic but currently underleveraged opportunity. Operation of a game jam would provide some lightweight prototyping chance for a variety of different titles that could be further developed.\n\n### **RATIONALE**\nThe community has showcased its ability to coordinate and create interesting and unique works, and a game jam competition would foster that spirit, and channel it into the production of several new potential game products that could be further grown into full releases. Through this process, community members interested in taking up such a project would have the opportunity to collaborate with other members, test their design theories, and work with the IP before comitting wholly to a major development.\n\n### **SPECIFICATIONS**\nThe following will be required to execute this proposal:\n\n* Scheduled calendar window for the actual game jam\n* Public \"Looking for Group\" channel in the Community Discord\n* Team registration page via itch.io or Google Form\n* Submission portal via itch.io or Google Form\n* Token gated judging / voting channel in Community Discord\n* Jam theme defined and tweeted by Keepers of WAGDIE Twitter\n* Participation rewards (POAPs and WAGDIE) [thanks @poof]\n* Prizes for winners (USDC or other)\n\n### **IMPLEMENTATION**\nThese are the steps to accomplish this proposal:\n\nPRE-VOTE\n1. Within Conclave, determine best week for game jam\n2. Within Conclave, determine prizing and participation rewards\n3. Within Conclave, determine operators responsible for Discord requirements\n4. Within Conclave, determine Keepers of WAGDIE assistance to announce theme\n5. Proposal voting / approval via decide.fateofwagdie.com\n\nPOST-APPROVAL\n1. Open \"Looking for Group\" channel in Community Discord\n2. Open team registration portal via itch.io or Google Form\n3. Announce game jam competition via Keepers of WAGDIE / Discord \n4. Await game jam commencement date\n5. Open submission portal via itch.io or Google Form\n6. Announce game jam commencement via Keepers of WAGDIE / Discord \n7. Await game jam conclusion date\n8. Collate all game jam submissions in judging / voting channel within Discord\n9. Announce game jam conclusion and game availability within Discord\n10. Await judging period closure\n11. Announce winner(s)\n12. Distribute prizes\n\n### **TIMELINE**\nAfter discussion of details and proposal adjustments within conclave, once brought to proposal approval vote, the process for the game jam should take approximately 4 weeks. Two weeks from announcement to allow teams to coordinate / schedule appropriately, one week for the actual game jam, and another week for adjudication.\n\n### **OVERALL COST**\nPending conclave discussion regarding additional participation rewards, the only associated cost to this proposal are the prizes for the winning entries.\n\nThis proposal suggests $5,000 for the winning entry, $2,000 for the second place, and $1,000 for the third place as a means to encourage the best products within the community, and as a potential attractor of exterior talent. A total of $8,000 USDC would be expended at these rates.\n\n### **SUMMARY**\nThis is a powerful way to generate incredible, playable, prototype WAGDIE products that could later be leveraged into more complete releases with or without The Conclave's support. Using the format of game jam to spark development and new project concepts within the WAGDIE community, as well as attract developers who are not currently participants to explore the project for the sake of the game jam.\n\n### **OPTIONALITY**\nWhile I believe this proposal can stand on its own merits without any addition, it is possible to coordinate an extension to it that would see the completed game jams released on Steam as Early Access titles under a WAGDIE Games publishing account with revenues returning to The Conclave and contributing developers. Interest and details should be discussed and confirmed within The Conclave before this proposal moves to voting.",

      "title": "WIP 10: Conclave Treasury Allocation ",
      "content": "## Abstract\n\nThis proposal seeks to convert 10% of the Conclave’s treasury from USDC to ETH.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThere are 2 main motivations - operational and financial. \n\nOperational:\nThere have been several proposals (WIP2, 4, 8) that required ETH payments. The allocation will act as a reserve for future proposals that require ETH.\n\nFinancial:\nSome creators would be willing to take ETH for payments within reasonable price windows: e.g. A 5E request at $1500 is still acceptable if ETH falls to $1000.\n\n## Rationale\n\nTreasury management is a difficult subject. We want to emphasize this allocation is geared more towards operational expenses with the added possibly of increasing the overall value of the treasury in the future. To that extent, we’ve capped the vote at 10%.\n\n## Specifications\n\nA decentralized exchange like Uniswap will be used to convert the USDC to ETH.\n\n## Steps to Implement\n\nThe community will vote to allocate 10% of the Conclave’s treasury to ETH. If the vote passes, 10% will be converted from USDC.\n\n## Timeline\n\nImplemented 1-3 days after the vote is passed.\n\n## Overall Cost\n\nIf passed, 10% of the Conclave's Treasury will be converted from USDC to ETH. \n\nAdditional costs include gas fees to convert USDC to ETH, and any potential loss in value of ETH against USDC.",

      "title": "WIP 9: WAGDIE Community Recognition Awards",
      "content": "**ABSTRACT**\n\nAwarding 6 community members with a Token of Concord (ToC) each, every WAGDIE Conclave cycle (6 weeks). \n\n**MOTIVATION**\n\nThe Two started their ToC distribution as a reward to community members for their notable work and this spirit of generosity and gratitude is a practice that needs to be carried forward. The WAGDIE community is full of ardent artists, skillful storytellers and brilliant builders whose products and creations deserve to be celebrated and awarded concretely. \n\n**RATIONALE**\n\nWhy ToCs? The first ToCs were handed out individually by the Two with the implication that those who received them would pass them out to other members of the community deemed to embody the lore spirit of those ToCs. As the project developed, the Two expanded their breadth of token delegation to different guilds. \n\nObjectively, by far and large, these ToCs have not found their way to circulation amongst the community. And while it's true that other manners of obtaining ToCs have been possible, the windows in which they operate (eg., live on spaces by answering riddles or participation in the Festival Tournament) are generally quite limiting, in both **quantity** and **opportunity**. While there are ~2.4k WAGDIE holders and 914 members in the Library discord, only 224 hold any kind of token. All this leads to a dearth of unique holders which this proposal seeks to challenge in proposing ToCs be awarded as opposed to WAGDIEs. \n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION**\n\n**STEP  1**: \n\n- The Two will create a new ToC that reflects their purpose of awarding outstanding work by community members., ex. Conclave Crucible, Candle, Crescent, Crest, Crown, Badge. They will mint, at minimum, *36* of these new ToCs. \n\n- A gnosis safe with multisig access by the six current Conclave Representatives will be created: [Gnosis Safe Address](https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0xa4aAFeCCCCBE6FcEb304d8e1dCA3ce7aF66ba3Ce/home)\n\n- The Two will setup a subdomain ENS: conclave.wagdie.eth & have it point at the gnosis safe.\n\n**STEP  2**:\n\n- The Two will airdrop a total of 36 ToCs to *conclave.wagdie.eth*. The makeup of ToCs is up to their discretion; it may be solely comprised of the new Conclave ToC or mixed with preexisting ones such as *Artificial Crystal* and *Fetid Talon*. \n\n**STEP 3**:\n\n- At any point during their term, each Conclave Representative may highlight the participation, effort, or initiative of a community member they deem has positively impacted the **WAGDIE** project. They will formally announce this via whatever channel they choose, be it Twitter or Discord, and award them by selecting and transferring one ToC from *conclave.wagdie.eth* to that individual's eth address. \n\n**STEP 4**:\n\n- At the start of a new election cycle, *conclave.wagdie.eth* gnosis safe access will be re-secured with access shifted to the appropriate new conclave representatives. \n\n\n**SPECIFICATIONS**\n\n* Each Conclave Representative reserves the ability to award one ToC during their 6 week term to another whose: \n\n**\"participation, activity, or efforts has positively impacted the **WAGDIE** project.\"**\n\nThis ability *is not* mandatory to exercise. They may choose to not award any during their term and cannot be forced to do so. No Conclave Representative is allowed to award more than one ToC. Conclave Representatives **cannot** award themself or another Conclave Representative. \n\nNo more than 6 ToCs will be awarded during each cycle. When the supply of ToCs in *conclave.wagdie.eth* diminishes, assessments will be made to request a new supply dropped from the Two in a similar process as dictated above.\n\n* The interpretation of merit by which each Conclave Representative chooses to award a member, along with the ToC they choose to award, is up to the discretion of that Conclave Representative. Other than verbalizing their rationale when naming that member, no other justification is required. \n\n*Veto Clause: If 4/6 Conclave Representatives formally voice a lack of legitimacy in an announced awarding, no award shall be made. In this situation, that Conclave Representative has forfeited his right to award any further for the remainder of their term. \n\n\n**TIMELINE**\n\nUpon passing snapshot vote, STAGE 1 will be executed immediately, with STAGE 2 following immediately. STAGE 3 will occur as stated within the current term cycle. \n\n**OVERALL COST**\n\n-Creation and minting of new ToCs (at the Two's expense) \n-Creation of mulitsig gnosis (at community's expense)\n-Creation of conclave.wagdie.eth subdomain pointed to gnosis safe\n-ToC transfer fees  (Conclave Treasury funding) \n\n.5 eth (deposited into the *conclave.wagdie.eth*)\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nThe virtues of generosity and gratitude are cornerstones of WAGDIE. In that spirit, individuals who expand the world and experience of WAGDIE need to be celebrated and awarded. Since ToCs are challenging to come by, and the fact that they hold less monetary value than WAGDIE while still being very desirable and thematically linked to ethos and lore, they make wonderful awards.",

      "title": "WIP 7:  World of WAGDIE (Map)",
      "content": "## World of WAGDIE\n\n#### Abstract - Two or three sentences that summarizes the proposal.\n\nWorld of WAGDIE is an interactive Google Maps style web app, that lets users explore the World of WAGDIE. This will include all basic map functionality you would normally expect using our current in-game map, map markers driven by Wiki content(locations/burns/deaths), and a Timelapse Mode showing our progress through the Main Storyline.\n\nAs most in the community know, [World of WAGDIE](https://wagdie.world/) is already live in production with some base functionality already implemented.\n\n#### Motivation - A statement on why the WAGDIE Community should implement the proposal\n\nOnboarding to WAGDIE is quite the task, and I believe a Map experience provides the right amount of visual introduction for new people interested in WAGDIE.\n\nAdditionally, the Timelapse Mode will provide a digestible and visual learning experience for those attempting to catch up on the events of WAGDIE's main storyline\n\n#### Rationale - An explanation of how the proposal aligns with the WAGDIE Community's mission and guiding values.\n\nWorld of WAGDIE aligns with the Community's mission for a few reasons:\n\n* It helps new people visualize our world\n\n* It helps new people catch up on the events of the main storyline\n\n* It helps combine community Wiki efforts, with Main Storyline map pieces\n\n* It's featured on fateofwagdie.com, which indicates adoption by the people behind the project\n\n#### Specifications - A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.\n\nWorld of WAGDIE is a web based application written in Javascript, specifically ReactJS.\n\nWorld of WAGDIE will be powered by the following technologies:\n\n- [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) for rendering the Map, and basic map functionality\n\n- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) a React framework for production applications\n\n- [wagdie.wiki](https://wagdie.wiki/) will be our \"back end\", serving the relevant data to power all features\n\nRepo:\n\n- https://github.com/HDDLabs/wagdie-map\n\n#### Steps to Implement - The steps to implement the proposal, including associated costs, labor, and other resources for each step where applicable.\n\n**The currently planned feature set is as follows:**\n\n1. Basic map functionality you would normally expect using our current in-game map (Complete)\n\n2. Map Markers driven by Wiki content(locations/burns/deaths) (In Progress)\n\n3. A Map Legend driven by Wiki content (Complete)\n\n4. A Map Marker Filter allowing for toggling Map Markers on and off (In Progress)\n\n5. A Timeline Slider widget that shows our journey thus far, with ability to Rewind and Fast Forward by dragging a slider (Not Started)\n\n ![map1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiho7spwq22deg7qam5mr6lmmdafppqi2nhdatvmixadk3dst2kjga)\n    \n\n**Timeline Slider**\n\nThis feature will include a [Material UI Discrete Slider](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-slider/#discrete-sliders) populated with values that represent the Chapters from the [Wiki](https://wagdie.wiki/en/story).\n\nWhen the user selects a value on the slider the following will happen simultaneously:\n\n- The You Are Here Map Marker will update to the location corresponding to the selected chapter\n- The Map will pan to that specific location\n- The Map Legend will update with Wiki Content from the selected chapter\n\n**Development:**\n\nI will be the sole developer on this project.\n\n**Design:**\n\nI would like to leverage community members to provide Design Assets for the The World of WAGDIE. Currently, the following assets provided by @Rollinorama are being used:\n\n![buttonsmap.png](ipfs://bafkreigoyeosgdg5osxobjr6grx4g3awhha5f76hqjwceeeq3llaii5nza)\n    \nAs development matures, and/or feedback is received, it is likely we will need new/updated assets. Funds should be allocated for this.\n\n**Bugs/Issues:**\n\nCommunity members can log and track issues via [Github Issues](https://github.com/HDDLabs/wagdie-map/issues) which will be addressed during development. Any high priority/crucial bugs must be addressed before final deliverables/payment.\n\n#### Timeline - Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates.\n\nWorld of WAGDIE Work began on **6/26/2022** and to date:\n\n- 2/5 features are Complete\n\n- 2/5 features are In Progress\n\n- 1/5 features are Not Started\n\nDevelopment work for World of WAGDIE is arranged around my full time job commitments. But within the span of approximately 1 month I've managed considerable progress.\n\nI expect to be able to continue at this pace, which would put me at an estimate of around 4-8 weeks for total completion of all proposed features.\n\nI expect to be complete with every proposed feature other than the Timelapse feature very soon, and then develop the Timelapse feature for the remaining time.\n\n#### Overall Cost - The total cost to implement the proposal (in ETH).\n\n##### Overall Cost: 11K USDC\n\n* Design Cost for any updates @Rollinorama may need to make : 1k USDC\n\n  * Distributed via a Multi-Sig on an as needed basis\n\n* Final Payment after all planned features are live: 10k USDC\n\n    * This is calculated by applying a discount to my hourly rate at ~120 hours of work\n\n##### Payment plan\n\n- 1k on hold for @Rollinorama\n- 5k after:\n    - Proposal passes\n- 5k after: \n    - All features are live\n    - All significant bugs/issues are resolved\n\nAll funds will be sent to a Multi-Sig controlled by myself and 2 Conclave Reps(brennen.eth and dontfeedthewolf.eth)\n\n##### Wallet Addresses:\n\n- Multi-Sig Wallet: 0x4A3eD43DfC8a116882D95dcabF1EBAbD712fbA0B\n- Prince Ham Doe Wallet: 0xDc0f9e358F8EEF58beA41b1Cad8FD23F84D15713\n\n#### Future Considerations\n\nWith the inclusion of World of WAGDIE on fateofwagdie.com, the door is open for additional features to discuss. These will be handled in a parallel workstream outside th scope of this proposal.\n\n#### Inspirations\n\nhttps://atlasofthrones.com/\n\nhttps://quartermaester.info/ ",

      "title": "WIP 6: WAGDIE QUEST - Events System ",
      "content": "\n##  **ABSTRACT**\n\nThe WAGDIE Quest Events System is a story driven community event system where we’ll regularly run PVE quests hosted on social media via Twitter to expand the lore and community interaction of the WAGDIE universe.  Participants will be able to put up their WAGDIE’s to go on pre-scheduled quests with others by sending them to the WAGDIE Inn Multisig (0xThriving, 0xG, KingOffling).  If successful, WAGDIE questers can earn rewards - but if they fail, they risk death!\n\nThe system is the PVE expansion of the WAGDIE Fight ([Bald Burner vs. Bald Savior](https://twitter.com/Bald_Savior/status/1541241744339046403?s=20&t=3zw3ZeVc0I39Z9Qcc0wgtQ)), and [Tournament of Death](https://twitter.com/Bald_Savior/status/1544908212322705408?s=20&t=3zw3ZeVc0I39Z9Qcc0wgtQ) that 0XThriving organized and put out in the last few weeks.  Events are operated via on-chain dice rolls and decisions by the participants, and are carried out visually and with links to the rolls on Twitter by the host 0xThriving.\n\nThe [first WAGDIE Quest](https://twitter.com/Bald_Savior/status/1553154908672499712?s=20&t=E_bzJhdEj-vCELNstxJL2A) was a success and positively reviewed by participants and viewers, and also gave us great feedback that will be incorporated into future quests to make them better!\n\nThe proposal will cover elements that may be created depending on the level of funding that include:\n\n- Hosting of multiple events with entry fee that goes to future quest rewards (revenue source)\n- Creation of a self-sustaining, open source system for this content\n- Build an item store system for these events (revenue source)\n- Live streaming of events + tools to put on a live stream of future events\n- Creation of [WAGDICE.com](http://WAGDICE.com) → on-chain dice rolling tool for wagdie + these events\n- Creation of a simple image generator to make quests higher quality, faster to deliver\n \n![image1.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreidtc67htdqwjl2qy6vjrm6mkkjn4og6hpt7s6ieds6vfdj6gdbdqi)\n    \nExample:  \n![image 2.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreibubtxq6kk26vi74yapfdfs5xkjk3devy4y25ylp5qo6edq45suxy)\n    https://twitter.com/Bald_Savior/status/1551090657590222848?s=20&t=tfU1ZE-pX4gwuQoJsiqoLA\n‎\n\n## **MOTIVATION**\n\nThis system creates engaging content for participants and the broader WAGDIE community, and creates deeper stakes and interaction within the WAGDIE universe.  As a WAGDIE owner, you get to see or imagine yourself as being a part of the content and universe in WAGDIE.\n\nWAGDIE Quest ultimately aims to deliver more entertainment via story telling and events, and be demonstrative to the community and outsiders looking into WAGDIE as to why the community driven approach WAGDIE has taken is so powerful.\n\nThe goal will be to create a self-sustaining, open source system that the community can use to generate quest content, and that can persist and evolve with the community.\n\n\n\n## **RATIONALE**\n\nThere are three huge parts of WAGDIE that are combined to make this an effective project for the Conclave to support:\n\n- Storytelling - WAGDIE captivates the community by pushing forward content. Quests allow the community to be even more involved in their story.\n- Community - WAGDIE empowers the community to build the world.  This is an explicit aim of this project - to build out a piece of the world’s story.\n- On-chain - WAGDIE pushes forward the power of ownership with concords + burning mechanics.  Quest offers similar mechanics with requiring WAGDIEs risk death for on-chain rewards.\n\n ![image 2.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreibubtxq6kk26vi74yapfdfs5xkjk3devy4y25ylp5qo6edq45suxy)\n    \n\n## **SPECIFICATIONS**\n\nWe’ll run ~3-5 events using this new system as we leverage those events to build out the system further and iterate with the community.\n\nThis system has 3 parts:\n\n- Quest content - the specific events you can face in a quest and story + game deisgn behind it.\n- Combat content - the characters, enemies, and combat system.\n- Live events - putting on the events requires some live production, iteration, asset building, and storytelling.\n\n![image3.png](ipfs://bafkreibkm2fbehluhzxtr5ntltmath2jlcnmvn4bj22qyhhih4bxda7qea)\n    \n\n*Example version of the first quest content (v2 - still iterating before launch)*\n\n\nThe quests themselves will be designed iteratively - the first one has been implemented and had positive reception.  Future quests will be changed, improved, and iterated on based on results from the previous quests in each of the above areas.\n\nThe high level objective of the quests from a design perspective will be:\n\n- Risk/reward → give some amount of risk of WAGDIE participants dying, but reward for them succeeding\n- Choice → give some choice in the events and how they playout\n- RNG → on-chain rolls create variability and excitement\n- Storytelling → create fun story moments that are entertaining and expand the universe and character development\n\nRevenue generation back to WAGDIE INN (for prizes)\n\n- We will create revenue streams that can contribute back to the Wagdie Inn to help facilitate future rewards and create a self sustaining economy:\n    - Small participation fee (~0.03 eth) to be a part of the quest or fight\n    - Selling items (i.e. health potions) via an NFT collection “shop”.  (ex: potions, armor, consumables)\n    - WAGDIEs who would die have a 50% chance to burn, 50% chance to be 'captured' and put into prize pool\n\n\nFrom an economics perspective:\n\n- We’ll aim for each quest, participants will risk losing their WAGDIE, but gain chance for reward - this will be as close to expected value neutral as possible, but will likely be a slight cost for participating to make the risk/reward work\n- Initial rewards will be funded partially by the contributions of this proposal, but our aim will be for a self sufficient system that can exist off of revenue + community donations. \n- The main goal of this is to produce value in the form of community engagement + content\n\n## **OPEN SOURCED GUIDES + LIVE EVENTS**\n\nIf we fund the larger commitments, we also will ‘open source’ this by the end of the events by putting together the content in a format that is replicable, and with detailed guides + instructions for people who would want to run their own quests in the future.  The goal of this is that we’ll have a system we can continue to leverage as a community to create more content and engagement.\n\nThe end deliverable of this will be a set of documents and tools that explain and facilitate creation of the three pieces of the system mentioned above (quest / combat / live events).\n\nThese events will be live hosted on Spaces, but if we fund larger commitments, we'll take the extra steps necessary to host them live on Twitch or a website (which will be more viable because of tools development).  Regardless, we’ll be aiming to make following the content as easy and engaging as possible, and will provide assets and documentation on how to host live events.  \n\n## **WAGDICE + IMAGE TOOL/LIVE QUEST WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT**\n\nThe current hosting of events is incredibly manual given no tools have been made for on-chain rolling or updating images around results of quest choices or rolls.  To facilitate higher quality, faster, and more accessible quest. creation, if we fund the higher commitment we'll develop two tools:\n\n1) WAGDICE  - hosted on wagdice.com will be an on-chain dice rolling system that anyone with a WAGDIE token can use.  It will be used as the source of truth in these quest and fight events, but will also be made in a way that it could be used for any WAGDIE related dice rolls.  (It will have flexible ability to roll multiple dice and flexible sides of dice etc.).  I'll build the spec and be the product owner for this, and will partner with a web3 developer from the community (likely through Poof) to develop and launch the tool.‎. (This tool concept is a direct result of feedback from the community, Poof, based on the first fights)\n2) QUEST IMAGE GENERATOR and/or LIVE WEBSITE - this will be a simple user interface that allows us to setup quest scenarios and parties, and then update them with results automatically with a click of a button.  It will dramatically reduce the overhead of making quests, increase the quality of the experience of participating/watching, and make them more accessible to others.  (This tool concept is a direct result of feedback from the community based on the first quest)\n\n0xThriving's experience is in product management and development, and we have some members of the community with strong connections around web3 development, so we have high confidence we can execute in building these relatively simple apps quickly.\n\nPoof is helping facilitate development of Wagdice, and 0xG has offered to take on development of the Quest Website if funding is approved.\n\nIn fact, 0xG already started prototyping the system:\n \n![image4.jpeg](ipfs://bafkreiauknr6bbeuvqa5pdqz6h5czqv46x3czbftsoeqhf5j3wbwf45vzm)\n    \n\n\n## **STEPS TO IMPLEMENT**\n\nWe have already run the first quest!  The process for designing the content and running the events is quite manual, but proven out by the success of these past events - and we now have data points to improve it.\n\nI’ll also be getting input and feedback from the community - both via a feedback form, and a content idea submission form after each battle.  So the content will be able to be designed with community inputs.\n‎\n\n## **TIMELINE**\n\nWe’ll continue running events in August as soon as this is approved, and we'll aim to run an event weekly depending on personal schedule + WAGDIE schedule.\n\nWe'll aim to develop tools that are funded in the first ~2 weeks so they can have the most impact possible on quests we run.  We'll plan to release the open source quest guide in 4-8 weeks.\n\n##  **OVERALL COST**\n\n**Community prizes -** Based on initial design + feedback from the community, we'd like to have a small prize purse to pull from funded by the conclave to help kick-off the next 1-3 quests - but the primary goal will be for the quest program to become self sufficient, with revenue share going back to WAGDIE INN for future prizes.\n\n**Design time, content, and system building -** Regardless of the outcome, I will likely do a handful of one-off events on my own as I enjoy creating them (like I did with the WAGDIE Tournament and Bald Burner fight).  But given the time that goes into planning and running them, to build out a more substantive offering I’m asking for some budget to pay for my time.  The amount I’m proposing to pay me for me designing and hosting the events is based on the amount of time I feel it will take to complete these, and the amount that will motivate me to deliver something great for the community.\n\n**Tool development** - Lastly, if we fund the larger commitment to build the tools, I think we'll be able to develop both the Dice and Image tools/website for $3-6k depending on quality we aim for and speed of development partner we choose to work with.\n\n## Voting Options:\n\n**A) $0 →  No commitment for events** \n\n- But likely a few over time with light prizes\n\n**B) $4k →  2 Conclave Sponsored Quests, Item Shop**\n\n- **EVENTS HOSTED:**  2 Conclave Sponsored Quest lines + Future community quests\n- **COMMUNITY PRIZES:**  $1k in prizes to initially fund sponsored quests\n- **ITEM SHOP:**  Build out a Quest/Fight item shop with revenue generation\n- **REVENUE** 30% to treasury, 30% to WAGDIE INN for prizes, 40% to content host for time\n\n**C)   $8k →  3 Conclave Sponsored Quests + Future community quests, Item shop, Open source tools for community hosting**\n- **EVENTS HOSTED:** 3 Conclave Sponsored Quest lines + Future community quests  \n- **COMMUNITY PRIZES:**  $2k in prizes to initially fund sponsored quests\n- **ITEM SHOP:**  Build out a Quest/Fight item shop with revenue generation\n- **OPEN SOURCE QUESTS SYSTEM + HOSTING GUIDE:**  Building out and Open sourcing the content system/tools/guides for community to host events\n- **REVENUE** 30% to treasury, 40% to WAGDIE INN for prizes, 30% to content host for time\n\n**D) $14k → 3 Conclave Sponsored Quests + Future community quests, Item shop, Open source tools for community hosting, Live stream events, Development of WAGDICE + Quest Image Generator**\n\n- **EVENTS HOSTED:**  3 Conclave Sponsored Quest lines + Future community quests  \n- **COMMUNITY PRIZES:**  $2k in prizes to initially fund sponsored quests\n- **ITEM SHOP:**  Build out a Quest/Fight item shop with revenue generation\n- **OPEN SOURCE QUESTS SYSTEM + HOSTING GUIDE:**  Building out and Open sourcing the content system/tools/guides for community to host events\n- **TWITCH STREAMING OR LIVE WEBSITE FOR EVENTS:**  Coordinate the live streaming of events + enable system to be easily viewed via live broadcast to increase accessibility and drive more excitement around audience participation.\n- **WAGDICE DEVELOPMENT:**  Develop a tool to make on-chain dice rolling (Polygon) easy for Quests, Battles, or other WAGDIE uses.  [WAGDICE.com](http://WAGDICE.com) deliverable for open use\n- **QUEST IMAGE GENERATOR DEVELOPMENT:**  Develop a tool to make images  + HP automatically to facilitate higher quality, quicker, more accessible quest live shows\n- **REVENUE** 30% to treasury, 50% to WAGDIE INN for prizes, 20% to content host for time\n\n## Revenue generation to Treasury, WAGDIE INN (for prizes), and Content Host\n\n We will create revenue streams that can contribute back to the Wagdie Inn to help facilitate future rewards and create a self sustaining economy:   \n- Small participation fee (~0.03 eth) to be a part of the quest or fight\n- Selling items (i.e. health potions) via an NFT collection “shop”.  (ex: potions, armor, consumables)\n- WAGDIEs who would die have a 50% chance to burn, 50% chance to be 'captured' and put into prize pool\n- 30% of revenue generated will go to Conclave.  Remainder will be split between WAGDIE INN for prizes and content host\n\n\nWallets:\n\n- Newcomer’s Inn Multi-sig for prizes (0xThriving, 0xG, King Offling): 0xbC0Ef90E869a142D078554877998fF2bAF310123\n- Wallet for Dungeon Master (0xThriving): 0x8e5782C333ff9fe3742C4907d98df6b1Fa546822",

      "title": "WIP 5: WAGDIE Recap Podcast",
      "content": "## **ABSTRACT**\n\nThe [WAGDIE Recap Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/6vSbVdit50yGlSPKtnqyLG?si=0827540f028d45fb) provides 5-10 minute theatrical narrated episodes recapping the key events within the WAGDIE narrative in an audio format through podcast syndication on popular platforms like Spotify. It has already produced 3 well-received episodes.\n\nFunding through this proposal will ensure the continued development of the [WAGDIE Recap Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/6vSbVdit50yGlSPKtnqyLG?si=0827540f028d45fb). It will ensure that episode production can be properly motivated, while also driving a schedule that provides an opportunity for the podcast to reach the present story beat, and find a routine release pattern.\n\n## **MOTIVATION**\nDelivering the WAGDIE narrative to more audiences in new formats is the keystone to more widespread awareness and adoption of the property. Offering a brief audio podcast format of the entire experience will allow a much wider audience of players and newcomers to enjoy the content, but also prepare themselves for integration in the active storyline.\n\n## **RATIONALE**\nThe first three episodes of the [WAGDIE Recap Podcast on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/6vSbVdit50yGlSPKtnqyLG?si=0827540f028d45fb) have been unanimously well-received and it has come to general agreement that its advancement would have a positive impact in the effort to onboard newcomers, providing entertainment, and exposing the WAGDIE narrative to the wider fantasy (non-crypto) audience.\n\nFormalizing this proposal would provide funding for the individuals who have been crucial to the podcast's current production, as well as provide the incentive and schedule to ensure its continued production.\n\n## **SPECIFICATION**\nThe following will be the product of this proposal:\n\n* 5-10 minute narrative audio programs\n  - Each episode progresses coverage of the WAGDIE storyline\n  - High quality theatrical production including music and sound effects\n  - Syndicated on popular podcast platforms (iTunes, Spotify) using PodBean\n* Routine release schedule delivered on a weekly basis\n  - 2 episodes per week initially\n  - 1 episode per week, once brought to present story beat\n\n## **IMPLEMENTATION**\nThese are the steps to accomplish this proposal:\n\n* Put proposal to snapshot voting for approval of retainer funding\n* Definition of prefered release dates (Tuesdays and Thursdays?)\n* Talent produces and syndicastes episodes in accordance with schedule\n* Conclave releases monthly funds to the talent in return for their production\n\n## **TIMELINE**\nOnce operational, the [WAGDIE Recap Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/6vSbVdit50yGlSPKtnqyLG?si=0827540f028d45fb) will operate on a weekly schedule, releasing 2 episodes per week until it is caught up to the present point of the narrative, and then reverting to one episode per week thereafter. There will need a 1-week lead time on production for the first pair of episodes, but will be routinely delivered thereafter.\n\nWe estimate that it will take 16 episodes to catch up to present timeline (it would require 12 if the story stopped today), and thus a total of 2 months before we are at the edge of the narrative.\n\nBy the third month, production will be down to 1 episode per week but can operate as a month-to-month operation in perpetuity. We will recommend a total 6-month period before renewing  this proposal for a second approval.\n\n## **OVERALL COST**\nCost for these productions will be handled on a per-episode basis, delivered monthly to the talent producing the shows. The Concord of Research has already covered syndication costs.\n\nEach episode will cost a total of $300 for payment towards a voice actor, script writer and audio engineer.\n\nThe first two months would each require $2,400 for 8 episodes per.\nEach month thereafter would require $1,200 for 4 episodes per.\n\n* Option A:\n   - 3 months of production\n   - 20 episodes\n   - $6,000 expense\n\n* Option B:\n   - 6 months of production\n   - 32 episodes\n   - $9,600 retainer\n\n* Option C:\n   - 12 months of production\n   - 56 episodes\n   - $16,800 retainer\n\nWhile **Option A** would provide a 3 month production schedule enough to get the podcast caught up to present storyline, **Option B** and **Option C** secure conclave funding as a retainer for the continued production of the podcast, delivered only alongside episode completion.\n\nPayment will be made monthly at the beginning of the month based on the number of episodes completed within the month prior.\n\n## **SUMMARY**\nFunding for the [WAGDIE Recap Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/6vSbVdit50yGlSPKtnqyLG?si=0827540f028d45fb) would provide financial motivation to three talented community members, while generating many hours of satisfying WAGDIE audio content that can be used as an onboarding tool, an entertainment experience, and a resource for players.",

      "title": "WIP 4: Artist Panel / Shared Collection Contract",
      "content": "**ABSTRACT**\nDevelop a panel of talented and trusted artists within the WAGDIE community that will control a wagdiearts.eth address and deploy a special ERC-1155 contract that can house mints of panel-approved artworks to make available for sale under as an \"official\" derivatives collection shared by all artists within the project.\n\n**MOTIVATION**\nAs more artists continue to create works based on the WAGDIE property, they are forced to mint their creations on their own collections, and garner their own audience for such releases. Creating a shared contract would provide a space for all artists to sell their derivative artworks within the community, find additional exposure for their works, and receive the monetary benefit of doing so. It would also look very cool as a unified collection housing so many different artists.\n\n**RATIONALE**\nDeploying a collection of WAGDIE derivative arts shared by all artists within the community will provide a valuable companion collection to the project while also highlighting the works of talented community creators who might othewise go unnoticed.\n\nRevenues generated through the wagdiearts.eth contract will compensate artists for their contributions to the community, as well as create a fund for additional commissions dictated by the wagdiearts.eth council, and provide royalty revenues to The Conclave.\n\n**SPECIFICATIONS**\nThe following will be required to execute this proposal:\n\n* An organized panel of talented and trustworthy artists\n* Formalized submission platform for incoming art evaluations\n* Deployment of a custom minting contract for the collection\n   - Contract will be developed by @tenacity.eth and reviewed by audit panel\n   - Includes minting approval for panel artists\n   - Includes automatic split for primary sale revenued\n   - Includes automatic split for secondary sale royalties\n\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION**\nThese are the steps to accomplish this proposal:\n\n* Open nomination / acceptance process for panel of at least 6 artists\n   - Nominees will be updated here, as approved: @ROMbrandt @Rollinorama @LostCowboy @josiah.peace \n* Create new category within The Conclave for artist communications\n* Define review and approval process among artistic panel\n* Establish wallet for essential to operation of collection\n   - Apply a recognizable ENS [wagdiearts.eth]\n   - Set up multi-sig requirement for mainnet deployment of contract\n* Deploy custom minting contract with the following specifications\n   - ERC-1155 for compatibility with editions and 1/1 pieces\n   - Ability to add / remove approved wallets wallets for minting\n   - Record artist wallet associated with each minted NFT\n   - Automatic primary sale revenue split:\n       - 85% to artist artist\n       - 10% to wagdiearts.eth\n       - 5% The Conclave\n   - Automatic secondary royalty split:\n       - 34% to artist wallet\n       - 33% to wagdiearts.eth\n       - 33% to The Conclave\n* Launch first artworks on the contract (determined by panel)\n* Announce program to the wider WAGDIE audience\n\n**TIMELINE**\nProvide 1 week from this proposal to elect the artistic council, and then 2 weeks thereafter to execute the rest of the implementation, including deployment of the collection contract and the minting of the first (internally determined) artworks. The art submission and reveiew process would remain open forever thereafter. Artistic panel reelection should happen every 3 months.\n\n**OVERALL COST**\nOnce the wagdiearts.eth wallet has been established it will need seeding with a nominal amount of 0.5 ETH for contract deployments, approvals, and other establishment mechanics as well as transfer fees for revenue relocation. Beyond this, royalties from the sales revenues will self-perpetuate the minting expenses and create a fund that can later be used to commission new arworks from the community, or fund potential showcase opportunities.\n\n**SUMMARY**\nThis is an inexpensive way to provide value to the artists within the community, create a new foundation for collectible art pieces within the WAGDIE ecosystem, unify various derivative creations under a shared umbrella, and generate revenues both for The Conclave and future artistic endeavors.",

      "content": "𝖂𝖊 𝖆𝖗𝖊 𝕬𝖑𝖑 𝕲𝖔𝖎𝖓𝖌 𝕿𝖔 𝕯𝖎𝖊 𝕴𝖓 𝕭𝖆𝖙𝖙𝖑𝖊\n\n## **Abstract** \n\nWAGDIE in Battle will be an off-chain UI based game using on-chain assets. This will include 1v1 \"Battles\", guild managment, tournaments with betting and prizes on-chain, PvE and a page for each WAGDIE to post updates on their own story progress.\n\n‎ \n\n## **Motivation** \n\nCurrently the barrier of entry is a big high to WAGDIE so having an easy to understand and follow game along with story telling it will be a lot easier to show the rest of the NFT community what we're about.\n\nUsing WAGDIE in Battle we can also interact together better and follow each others stories by following those characters.\n\n‎ \n\n## **Rationale**\n\nWAGDIE In Battle will have playable storylines created by your own character, post your updates on your characters page, join guilds, fight others or even together. I feel this fits exactly what the community enjoys and fits the theme too.\n\n\n\n‎ \n\n## **Specifications** \n\nThis will be a website that is powered by a server that handles all the game logic along with interactions on-chain where needed. I will have a database that stores all the games information.\n\nCurrently as it stands all assets owned by the player would never be touched and only be used a proof of ownership to play the game. If we wanted to add death mechanics or on-chain betting that would have to change but currently assets will be 100% safe.\n\n‎ \n\n## **Steps to Implement**\n\nCurrently I am building the base of this project already and have posted many updates on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/_0xG__)\n\nI will be handling the frontend, backend, solidity and database myself as I'm most comfortable doing that so I can move at a fast pace and not depend on other work to be completed. As I progress to a better state I plan to release a base version that I will continually expand upon as I go with frequent updates and suggestions that the community make.\n\n‎ \n\n## **Timeline**\n\nAs more thought has been put in to each feature I'd expect a fully featured beta version to be live in 8-12 weeks although the base game with tournaments, PvP, PvM and renaming your character should be done in that 4-6 weeks with a beta even sooner.\n\n![FVx76mDWYAEm5sp|389x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/fateofwagdie/original/1X/738e65d3c8e3fdf27c4ec1aa4b4fee2e466f90de.jpeg)\n![08d5e3e1ddaa5dce9feb117515ae86e6|539x500](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/fateofwagdie/original/1X/3049cb53e7cc7c7c970c732ae6792411c439ab80.png)\n![1d49472e9bb5cdb51e98e2ce93e7f7ba|490x499](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard14/uploads/fateofwagdie/original/1X/d2d7268cea11dedc74f26757210a539a7143ec39.gif)\n\n\n\n## **Overal Cost**\n\n10k USDC \n\nWallet: 0x82947b9Fe407c0ac262196a6aBB1266256D4b2c1\n\nThis game will be created regardless of the outcome of this proposal, the only thing that will be different will be the speed and amount of features. I currently work as a full time web 3 developer and have many projects I work with so my time is super limited. \n\nIf someone was to come to me with this idea I'd quote them $20-25k because it's a massive massive task but since I also would love to contribute I'll be able to grind and work on this with degenerate work hours and continuous updates for 10k USDC.\n\nOf course these things take a lot of work and I've already put in well over a hundred hours.\n\n## **If Proposal Passes**\n\n* PvE System.\n* PvP System.\n* Tournaments.\n* Betting.\n* Community funded NFT shop paid with in-game currency.\n* Page for every wagdie to post updates to your own personal story.\n* Feed page of all characters that you follow.\n* Guild management system.\n* Guild fights.\n* Guild specific missions\n* Leaderboard\n* Level system for every WAGDIE\n* Rename your WAGDIE with your lore name.\n\n\n## **If Proposal Fails**\n\n* PvE System.\n* PvP System (Only 1v1s)\n* Guild management system (Limited features).\n* Leaderboard\n* Level system for every WAGDIE\n* Rename your WAGDIE with your lore name.\n\n## **Payment plan.**\n\n**50% after proposal passes**\n\n**25% after these features are live**\n\n* PvE System.\n* PvP System.\n* Tournaments.\n* Betting.\n* Leaderboard\n* Level system for every WAGDIE\n* Rename your WAGDIE with your lore name.\n\n**Final 25% after these features are live**\n\n* Community funded NFT shop paid with in-game currency.\n* Page for every wagdie to post updates to your own personal story.\n* Feed page of all characters that you follow.\n* Guild management system.\n* Guild fights.\n* Guild specific missions\n\nIf the community wants any more specific features or super major changes to existing features we will likely require another proposal to help fund that within reason of course.\n\n## **After Development**\nIf a situation arises where I am either unable to or no longer wanted to develop or maintain WAGDIE in Battle I will release the source code of everything to the community.\n\nThe situations where this would happen are:\n\n1. I no longer have time to develop additional features past this proposal features without funding.\n\n2. A proposal passes that requires me ceasing all development and handing over the source code (I'd no longer work on it after this)\n\n3. The price I quote for development work is deemed too high (unlikely, I like wagdie and WAGDIE in Battle is already being done at a huge discount) and the community wants to hire a new developer.\n\n## **Payment Voting**\nIf a client came to me asking me to develop something to this scale I'd ask maybe $35k and I've seen members of the community acknowledge that my price is super cheap. If possible I'd like to have a vote on how much to allocate to this as in.\n\n1. $10k\n2. $12.5k\n3. $15k\n\nThis is completely optional and the only reason I add this is because I do need to pay rent and allocate my time properly among projects I'm working on. If I'm paid a slightly higher amount I'm able to justify allocating this project more which I would be super happy to do!\n\nEven at the highest $15k that is less than 9% of the total treasury for all of the features above is extremely reasonable in my opinion and will be a massive driving force to lowering the barrier of entry and providing \"utility\" outside of the story and lore.\n\n## **Safety audits**\nCompletly on board with any audits, there is currently a proposal to set up auditors for community made projects which I've been nominated for also so I am fine with helping prove safety of any features.",

      "title": "WIP 2: Audit Contract Squad",
      "content": "**ABSTRACT**\nDevelop a formalized contract review and approval system for community-based projects, providing a seal-of-approval indicating a level of safety for releases requiring wallet interactions.\n\n**MOTIVATION**\nAs the community continues to grow and develop experiences using on-chain mechanics, security and trustworthiness will be paramount for widespread adoption. Without any authority to approve community-derived contracts, there is a significant vulnerability to malicious actors that will hinder growth and put participants at risk.\n\n**RATIONALE**\nOrganizing a community-driven board of developers and a seal-of-approval process will allow anyone working on a WAGDIE companion contract to have their work audited by trustworthy figures, allowing them to provide their experience to the community in full confidence. With such approval, inexperienced members of the community will have an easy method of understanding if a companion contract is safe to interact with, and will feel less hesitant in participating in community-developed efforts.\n\n**SPECIFICATIONS**\nThe following will be required to execute this proposal:\n\n* An organized panel of competent and trustworthy developers\n* Formalized submission platform for incoming project audits\n* Established audit guidelines, and review process of the panel\n* Officiated release method, providing on-chain seal-of-approval\n\n**IMPLEMENTATION**\nThese are the steps to accomplish this proposal:\n\n* Open nomination / voting process for panel of at least 4 auditors\n– Nominees have been defined as @0xG @0xfadedface @tenacity.eth @poof\n* Create new category within The Conclave for auditor communications\n* Define review and approval process among auditor panel\n* Establish on-chain seal-of-approval through auditor-controlled wallet\n– Register a recognizable ENS for auditor-controlled wallet [wagdiedev.eth]\n– Set up multi-sig requirement for mainnet deployments / interactions\n– Wallet may deploy community contracts once approved\n* Define contract submission instructions, and post them publicly on platforms\n\n**TIMELINE**\nThis time to implementation could be relatively quick. Provide 1 week from this proposal approval to elect the auditors, and then 2 weeks thereafter to execute the rest of the implementation. The contract submission and review process would remain open forever thereafter. Auditor panel reelection could happen every 3 months.\n\n**OVERALL COST**\nOnce the joint auditor wallet has been established it will need seeding with a nominal amount of 0.5 ETH for various contract deployments, approvals and other establishment mechanics. Beyond this, individual Conclave proposals wishing to release contracts can have their additional funds sent directly to the auditor wallet for its process.\n\n**SUMMARY**\nThis is an inexpensive way to assure community safety as various proposals and independent projects attempt to provide value through on-chain contract interactions. Establishing a secure audit process and throughline to deployment will help provide a seal-of-approval that can offer an at-glance level of trust, which will help foster engagement for community-developed projects.",

      "content": "**Returning Value to the Community Treasury**\n\n## **Abstract** \nIncome generating projects funded by the community treasury should return a portion of earnings back to the community. Originally polled in Discourse with 24 voters, 30% in the lead - too small of sample size to go into Yes, No, Abstain so will push this live with Single Vote: 20, 30, 40% No or Abstain.\n\n**This proposal is not intended to force all projects to be income generating.**\n\n## **Motivation**\nCreating a more sustainable treasury is key to the success of the project. This will allow the community to continue funding more interesting projects and potentially grow the treasury past it currents value!\n\n\n## **Rationale**\nProjects developing within the WAGDIE ecosystem are benefitting from the work done by the team as well as the community. Direct funding of community projects also enables builders to offset risk and recoup development costs prior to launch. \n\nThe value added for building on top of WAGDIE warrants a return of a portion of earnings back to the treasury. \n\n## **Specifications**\nProposals with earnings potential will agree to share at least the minimum agree upon percentage with the treasury. This can be accomplished using on-chain methods (i.e. splitter code in smart contracts) or through off-chain agreements.\n\n## **Steps to Implement**\nDecide on if there should be a minimum split between project builder and treasury.\nSnapshot vote to codify this amount\nCreate framework to provide projects and approved implementations.\n\n## **Timeline**\nThis proposal is mostly policy based and can be implemented right away if it passes. \n\n**Overal Cost** - 0 USDC cost.",

May this Proposal for community appointed representatives align the Conclave by following in similar footsteps.\n\n### Steps to Implement\n- The top 6 entries will be manually promoted to T4 by Discourse admins\n- Admins and mods will provide resources on proposal and snapshot processes.\n- Addresses of the 6 will be added to snapshot to allow the creation of new proposals.\n\n\n### Timeline\nElected users will be promoted to T4 and onboarded within 24H of the conclusion of the snapshot vote. \n\n### Overal Cost - The total cost to implement the proposal (in ETH).\nThe only cost is Time & Engagement by the community. This proposal does not require funding.\n\n### Key Terms\nWIPS: Wagdie Idea Proposals\nConclave Representative: Trust Level 4 users that guide New Proposals into Final Proposals for Live Voting.\n",
