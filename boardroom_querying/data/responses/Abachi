      "title": "Temperature Check: Resolving Abachi",
      "content": "Synopsis: \n\nI suggest the protocol resolves and returns funds to the DAO / tokenholders given the lack of updates, engagement and PMF.\n\nRationale:\n\nIt's no secret that the Abachi protocol has come to a grinding halt for some time. Although a migration was done from Polygon to Arbitrum, the protocol has yet to capitilise on this migration. Without utility for the native $ABI token, the price has seen a decline for years now (switch graph to ETH pricing). The socials and discord have been vacant by both community and team and only a handful of people appear to remain.\n\nAbachi improvement proposal 16, was among the proposals launched in Sept 2022 to improve the tokenomics and attractiveness of the $ABI token, by launching reverse bonds with the revenue generated. This proposal has yet to be implemented, or started on for that matter.\n\nCurrently, there is a plan of creating a L3 with Abachi nodes, where $ABI is needed to stake on a node. However this plan appears to be to little to late. Not only does this look like a BSC 2021 Node project idea, like said before, there is little to no community left to use this product and other products have spent considerable time during the bear to buidl and ship, while Abachi hasn't.\n\nGiven the lack of updates on this new roadmap, the absence of tangible milestones, and a team and community who are latent to engage with one another, I believe its in everybodies best interest to resolve the protocol. Everybody is then free to use the freed up capital as they please, instead of having it 'stuck'  in a protocol that continues to lose value. \nThe fact the $ABI token appears to trade \"under backing\" as some OG members keep saying, is testament to the markets trust/appetite for this project.\n\nAbachi currently has 1 loan, with Luca+ (a protocol on which Electo is advisor/seeder) with a sub-market interest of 6-7% pro annum. (according to public information). If we cancel this loan there will be nothing standing in the way of resolving the entities in Dubai and elsewhere and return the funds to the ABI holders pro-rate.",

The partnership will yield 4 year vested 100,000 LIQ tokens for Abachi and voting rights to boost yield from day 1.\n\nMotivation\nWe have enjoyed some amazing yields from Timeless Finance since moving with them a month ago. \n\nTo extend this further, the proposal aims to seek a partnership with Liquis which is a convex layer on top of Timeless Finance. \n\nLiquis team reached out to us for a partnership and we have a dedicated channel with them on their discord.\n\nCurrently to be able to boost our yield, we need to lock LIT tokens for 4 years. We own 82,000 veLIT. This proposal will help us get a much more vote power by making those veLIT into a liquid token called LIQ. The token can then be farmed or used to boost yields and also allows an exit if ever needed. \n\nWe currently earn $3000-$4000 of LIT yields per month. The ask in this proposal is to commit $10,000 worth of LIT into liquis. This roughly equates to 2 months of yields.\n\nUsing this we will be able to increase liquid backing of Abachi treasury and at the same time divert yields to LP stakers in both arbitrum and ethereum. \n\nIn theory, as liquidity comes in demand, both price and the ability to enter and exit the pair with greater sums of money should become easier.\n\nTerms of the deal: https://mirror.xyz/liquis.eth/K_-1jp7sLkylKc2V1XxkK0CObsqyaTq-89yScI4tapo\n\nAlso we will still earn the pre-launch bonuses on top of the launch partner program tokens.",

      "title": "[ABIP-21] - Redeem pABI for ABI",
      "content": "Summary\n\nAs a follow up to [ABIP-20] there is an overhang of pABI supply that needs to be settled. This proposal is to allow a direct redemption of pABI against the ABIv2 with no extra collateral needed to be added as backing or vesting needed. \n\nThis will motivate both the current contributors and team, and also future users who buy ABI or use the system that the supply shown is the final number with no other rebase, p or any other type of tokens.\n\n\nMotivation\n\nAs part of the initial setup of Abachi, pABI was sold as an option to convert into ABI by paying the backing.  The assumption at the time was that the protocol would be running at a premium to backing. This assumption has been proven wrong by every single rebasing protocol, including Olympus DAO, which was at a 4x-10x premium when we started and even higher before that.\n\npABI buyers are the longer term supporters of the protocol and include the founding team & investors. While some have had to redeem their pABI since our launch, there are a few that have absolutely stood tall and not even asked a single question.\n\nThe team was not confident in any launch during the phase every protocol was either getting rugged or its backers being liquidated. Our focus was on survival, and this decision may or may not have been the best, but we are still standing. Nonetheless, timelines were missed and we need to get back into build mode to make up.\n\nAfter the launch, the pABI holders have had a few opportunities to redeem. \nTeam bought back pABI at open market using a v3 pool.\nAbachi Labs bought back pABI at OTC.\nLock pABI to vest for gABI without paying a backing\n\nIt is important to mention here that the team tokens, and those bought back after market have not been vested and missed out on rebase rewards. They are still locked in the main DAO wallet.\n\nThis we think is the best path forward as it allows the team, long term investors to have confidence in the protocol and the backing. It also locks the team into delivery to realise any of those tokens. \n\nNumbers\npABI issued = 385500\nCurrent ABI supply = 311,811\n\nTotal v2 initial circulating supply (ABI+pABI) = 697311\nTotal v2 unlocked circulating supply (Removing team locked tokens) = 411311\n\nKeep in mind the unlocked circulating supply also includes the ABI in LP pools, and the true unlocked circulating is: ~350,000\n\nSee locking info below \nBacking v2 unlocked = $2.8 (Current market rates, higher if BTC/ETH higher)\nBacking v2 ABI + pABI  = $1.69 (not a meme  ) \nBacking v2 total 1m proposed supply = $1.1 \n\nLocking\nThe team has agreed to lock the 286,000 pABI that will be converted into a multi-sig until a fully working protocol is delivered or voted otherwise. \n\nMethodology\n\nOnce the v2 token and contracts are launched and the LP pools have been established, the team will allow a redeem feature for pABI via the app. Since the holder list is not big, these will be directly airdropped as the new token to holders. \n\nVested pABI will also be converted into ABIv2 at a pro-rata basis.\n\n\nFollow up\nThe proposal will be followed up with one more that will setup the LP pools for the new tokens and also allow for added liquidity to acquire ABI via the v3 pools below backing giving ABI a hard floor.

      "title": "[ABIP-20] - Launch ABI v2 Natively on ETH. Limit total supply to 1m.  Proposal  Governance July 20, 2023",
      "content": "Summary\n\nIn light of the recent multichain issues, we are proposing to push up the timeline of moving the token to ethereum. The new token will be based on the L2StandardERC20 and will natively support bridging to L2s. This mean once deployed on Ethereum, it can be bridged using the ERC-20 bridges on arbitrum and optimism. \n\nToken deployments will be tested before going live, but the entire process will be expedited. The token will be a standard token contract audited and highly vetted using zepplin libraries. \n\nAlong with this proposal, we also propose to limit the total supply of the token to 1m. This supply is enough to cater to all current ABI + pABI in circulation. More details on this below. \n\nMotivation\nIn our roadmap we mentioned our priority now is to estabish a base on an L2 and some tools that were not available to us regarding standard L2 token contracts are now publicly released. Given the multichain issues, current the anyswap bridge is completely defunct and this will cause prices to fluctuate between Ethereum and Polygon. \n\nThe team wants to establish a token standard that can be used natively on L2 and hence we are proposing pushing this forward.\n\nConsiderations\nGiven this proposal, some questions that have been brought up are answered:\nHow would we incentivize bonds and pools?\nThe team proposes a new token based on the oLIT design (option) will be introduced when we need to start incentives. This decision will be taken in future via a vote. The new token will also be the base of any new L3 chains we may launch (still early planning)\nWhat about ABI?\nIt will become a purely governance token and will share protocol fees from bonds, farms, LP and give the right to holders to vote how much to direct. The ABI LPs & Auto-Compounding will allow holders to still increase their coins. The compounding happens via buybacks from the revenue.\ngABI sABI and pABI?\ngABI and sABI will be eliminated in favor of a veABI (launched later) which allows you to boost your rev share based on locked duration. There will be a seperate governance vote to allow redemptions for pABI. Proposal coming soon.\n\nMethodology\nDeploy tokens in testnets for arbitrum, optimism and zksync.\nDeploy tokens to mainnet\nAllow 1:1 redemption of ABI via the app.\nAllow redemption for ABI against sABI or gABI via the app\nLP will be moved to the new token upon deployment on ETH and removed on Polygon.\nThe mint function on deployment will issue te entire supply. Extra supply which is not sold or held by anyone will be deposited back into the DAO treasury (abachi.eth)\n\nNew Supply\n311,775 circulating ABI (may change slightly as some last rewards come through)\n385,000 pABI\n303225 DAO Treasury (For future use)\n\nTotal 1m.\n\nConversion / Swaps\nYou will be able to send your tokens on polygon (sABI, ABI, gABI) to a smart contract and claim them back on Ethereum Mainnet.\nThere is no deadline to swap. You can do it whenever, your coins & marketcap will remain the same.\nREBASING as of now has been turned off.",

      "title": "[ABIP-19] - LP Pools on Timeless Finance",
      "content": "Summary\nAs a follow on to the roadmap we posted on mirror. The team is proposing all rebasing be stopped on the polygon app and moved to yield farming and single sided ABI auto farming. This stop all inflation on ABI and replaces it with LIT rewards paid by Timeless Finance. This vote also approved the treasury to bribe and buy votes to ensure the yields remain higher than current rebasing. \n\nMotivation\n\nDuring the last year, we have seen all rebasing projects move away from this approach as token prices plummeted below their backing. ABI is no different. Before any method of redemption against backing or anything else is introduced, its important that current staking be turned off in its current form. This will mean the rebasing rewards will tend to 0 over a period of 4 weeks and will be replaced by rewards paid via the LP pools. \n\nMethod\n\nIn the proposal the team will be carrying out the following functions:\nTurn rebasing off on app.abachi.io. This does not affect any staked sABI or gABI, those can remain staked for now, but rewards will gradually trend to 0 over 4 weeks.\n\nAcquire enough votes via purchasing veLIT with a maximum limit of $20,000 to ensure yields on our LP farms are always high. veLIT also allows us to share revenue from Timeless finance, which is currently yielding 50% APY paid out in ETH + BAL.\n\nApprove bribing for Abachi pools up to a maximum limit of $1500 per month to increase the yields in our pools. This will only be used by the team during epochs where APY falls significantly. As a metric, current bribes can be seen on hidden hand (redacted cartel) and 1500 would be one of the top bribes currently (timeless is still growing).\n\nStart work on an auto-compounder pool, where users can stake ABI-WETH for a fixed yield paid each epoch (week) in ETH. Much like GMX. The auto-compounder will charge a small fee for the compounding, and pair the users ABI-ETH into the timeless pool for yield. A portion of the auto-compound fee will be added back into the ABI-WETH pool as additional liquidity.\n\nStart work on an auto-compounder pool where users can stake just ABI and the treasury will pair it with ETH to earn yields in Timeless Finance. This way the user assume no IL and the rewards will be paid out in ETH.  A portion of these auto compound fees will be used to buy back ABI.\n\n\nConclusion & Final thoughts\n\nThe proposal is a big win for ABI if we can score enough votes and maintain yields and this strategy has worked wonderfully well for other projects to boost their own LP. \n\nThose who enter and stake earlier and before the compounders launch will benefit the most. As predicted with the current votes we have, the APY on ABI-WETH pool will be 176% starting Friday, and can be boosted a lot more for veLIT holders. This APY when the auto-compunder launches will trickle down to the holders who hold smaller accounts and want to avoid the gas fees in ethereum to farm the yields.",

      "content": "tldr: Unify all liquidity under ABI/WETH on mainnet. This includes removing and reducing the LP on polygon. Remove rebasing and replace with high yielding LPs.\n\nDiscussion Link: https://discord.com/channels/898415838716104794/1123586606742388767\n\nSummary\nAs recently posted in the roadmap, Abachi wants to move to the parent chain and now seems to be the best time to do it, given fees are relatively low and lots of new L2/L3 competitors are popping up. This is a big governance vote and involves a few different steps. They are included together in one vote to keep things easy, but if there is discussion and need, these can be broken down and voted separately.\n\nThis proposal will do the following:\n\nReduce Polygon liquidity by 80% right away and completely in a future vote.\nBridge liquidity over to ABI/ETH v3 pool on uniswap.\nRemove and migrate liquidity to ABI/ETH v3 pool on uniswap.\nIncentivise these pools using Timeless Finance and Hidden Hand\nAcquire veLIT to boost yields on these pools.\n\nMotivation\nRebasing is no longer a viable way to inflate supply. We want to pivot to removing rebasing completely and replacing it with high yields via a crv/convex mechanism. This has shown to be the most efficient way to increase liquidity and CRV wars are heating up again as even Sam Altmans stable coin is now bidding 20m to acquire CRV. We have a unique edge here as we have an opportunity to acquire 1% velit voting rights and boost our own pools. \n\nWith this said, we will need to unify our LP to one v3 uniswap pool. This should eliminate the need for arbing two pools and in the future an autocompounder can be added for the yields from timeless finance. While these yields are not live yet, Abachi is now approved as a gauge on timeless finance and starting the next epoch we should be able to track this APY from timeless on our Abachi pools. \n\nThis vote will be followed by a few others to help bring to life the plan outlined in the roadmap, including a v2 of the ABI token in the future so that the mint functions can be removed and supply is finite.",

      "title": "[ABIP-17] Flex or Sell that gOHM pt2",
      "content": "This proposal is an extension / update to ABIP-15:\nhttps://forum.abachi.io/t/abip-15-rfc-flex-or-sell-that-ohm/66/7\n\nSummary\nGet community buy in on the fine-print terms of Flex Loans from Olympus DAO which we were not aware of at the time of ABIP-15 vote, and are not what we had hoped. The loan effectively gives Olympus DAO control of the collateral and the LP 100%, and opens up Abachi to risk from Olympus DAO.\n\nThis proposal puts forth two options; take the loan and take on the risk, or sell the gOHM into ETH and launch LP against ETH.\n\nMotivation\n\nAs per ABIP-15 governance vote (and the associated community AMA) it turns out that our understanding of the Flex Loan was incomplete.\n\nAfter further discussion with the Olympus team and studying the incur-debt option on Flex Loan smart contract, the team feels there is a significant risk in this intiative which should be voted via the community if we are to proceed.\n\nOur understanding was that we could put up our gOHM as collateral and put in 100% of the borrowed OHM into an LP which would be owned by Abachi DAO. This however is not the case.\n\nThe Olympus team will keep the gOHM and the LP position in a smart contract until the debt is paid back in full. In order to get our tokens (ABI + gOHM) back, we would therefore need to liquidate the LP to get our collateral + ABI tokens back.\n\nThere has been extensive discussions internally around this, and the team feels that while the net cost is still zero, it puts us in an unnecessarily exposed position which is not the most ideal way to execute this.\n\nRisks:\n\nWe need to be mindful that Abachi is not an official partner of Olympus DAO nor have we been incubated by them (as other protocols have). We bought the gOHM at market and if we are to take this loan we would not be able to show this position as backing as the protocol does not own it.\n\nWe also do not have sufficient governance (effectively none after Flex Loans) in case Olympus decides to renege or change the rules of the Flex Loan. We already saw the revised APY that materialized after the Flex Loans applications had been processed. We feel there is an uneeded amount of trust required for protocols to do this.\n\nProposal:\n\nInternally the team is now against the option of taking out a Flex Loan and recommend selling the gOHM position into ETH (which we are up on).\n\nIf we sell the gOHM into ETH at these prices, we net ~80 ETH. This offers two key advantages:\n\nShort term: The LP on Ethereum will launch at roughly $6.6 per ABI. We expect the arb would bring this price down on ETH Mainnet LP and up on Polygon LP.\nLong term: Since ETH prices are currently depressed, as ETH $$ value goes back up, ABI will experience positive impermanent loss, thereby ALSO going up in $$ value in the ETH Mainnet LP.\nTogether these two should create a positive flywheel effect on the price of ABI.\n\nHowever, if we decide to go ahead with the flex loan, even though we will still aim to launch the LP at $6.6, the backing value will be reduced by roughly 10%. We cannot count this as backing as it requires trust and we do not own the LP or the collateral at this point.\n\nOlympus has told us that Flex Loans v2 will enable a different approach, however we don’t have a fixed timeline for that. Once the v2 is launched, we might revisit this in a separate proposal.\n\n",

      "title": " [ABIP-16] - Transition to staking & inverse bonds",
      "content": "Summary\n\nOlympus DAO is reducing their APY significantly and moving to a range bound model with sustainable emissions. In line with this reduce APY and rebase the tokens at a 5% emission per year until staking nodes are launched for validators (6 months out).\n\nRemove 60% APY and replace with static 5%.\nAllow buy back for ABI with yields, inverse bonds & hold in treasury until backing price is achieved.\nMotivation\n\nAs previously passed in ABIP-13 we are ready to transition to mainnet. There are a few house keeping things that need to be done before this launched.\n\nRemove the APY and replace with static 5% rebasing.\nWe can no longer rely on the Olympus DAO rebasing since it is being moved down to roughly 7% per year. With v3 OHM release and range bound pricing, it would not make sense to rely on OHM increasing in market cap to allow emissions of ABI (which it was based on).\nThe transition will be to a static 5% per year for those who stake ABI as sABI or gABI. No token changes or app changes will be needed.\n\nAllow inverse bonds & Buy backs for ABI\nSince ABI is currently trading below backing, the proposal is to allow buy back of ABI to bring closer to backing. For this yields will be used to buy back ABI and this ABI will be sent back to treasury. The current yields come from Balancer, CVX, MTA, GMX & Vesta.\n\nAs a second part to this also allow inverse bonds (which will take a couple of weeks to deploy at least). These bonds will allow anyone to bond back ABI and receive gOHM or ETH.\n\nThe proposal if passed aims to provide a stability to liquidity in the ABI pool and a methodology to more accurately represent the backing value of liquidity.\n\nBuybacks and inverse bond ABI will sit in the treasury. We did some test buy backs you can see in the treasury contract. The DAO owns these and can decide in future what to do with these. They will not be counted as circulating. If we ever open up bonds again, these ABI will be used instead of minting new ones.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe reduction in APY will be performed by the policy team as previously. In this case the APY will drop to 5% in a 2 week period when / if passed.\n\nThe buy back for ABI via yields will be done at random days during the week during 12 - 1pm UTC. We are planning every Monday and Friday, however the team may alternate this as per market conditions and multi-sig availability.\n\nInverse bonds will be launched after testing to allow folks to bond back ABI for backing value. The backing value will be accurately calculated and displayed on our dashboard, for keen observers, they can look at the treasuries. Abachi acquired 48 ETH & 7 BTC recently and still holds 40gOHM. For reference, there is 161k ABI circulating with 50k of that currently in pool.",

      "content": "Summary\n\nOlympus DAO is moving towards a range based currency and reducing the APY significantly.\n\nProposal is to guage between options on what to do with the OHM Abachi holds. Discussion is encouraged.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe treasury team feels the price will now stagnate for OHM and trade slightly below the backing which is currently around $11. This is because with the lower emissions OHM transitions into a much more of a stable model and risk adjusted this will range below $11 (currently its around 10.5).\n\nThis proposal is to gauge community advise on what to do moving forward since our base thesis for OHM was because of its rebasing nature.\n\nOHM will still focus as the DEFI currency and we can still use it as that. There are some really good options for that also.\n\nOverall Abachi is down in USD terms for OHM but we are up in terms of ETH\n\nThe options we have:\n\nOpen an OIP with Olympus DAO to receive a flex loan against our OHM and launch an LP on mainnet for OHM/ABI. This will also require the bridge which we have already approved. 75% of gOHM will be used for a flex loan and 25% for inverse bonds.\nFlex Loan:\nA new product by Olympus DAO which allows us to loan 100% LTV against our OHM. So essentially we will be putting in 40gOHM and getting the equivalent amount of OHM back as a loan. This is a 0% interest loan with no risk of liquidation.\n\nThe loan is paid whenever we decide to (no interest) and the position accrues the base yields automatically (so its essentially repaying itself).\n\nSell gOHM against ETH and launch an ABI/ETH pool. 25% will be used for inv bonds.\n\nLaunch inverse bonds against gOHM. 100% gOHM used for inv bonds.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo launch an OHM/ABI pool on balancer, we will need to open an OIP with OHM which we suspect should pass without issues. We are using OHM as its intended use case. No other pairs will be launched until voted on later if demand increases. The only pair will be ABI/OHM.\n\nSecond option is simple, the treasury team will try and sell gOHM for the best ETH price. This should net us slightly above 50 ETH.\n\nInverse bonds will be launched to allow folks to bond back ABI for backing value.",

This ensures the team is aligned for the long run and their tokens will vest with the other pABI unlocks.\n\nMotivation\nThe team monthly overhead for Abachi is currently still quite low. We are spending roughly 22k - 25k per month in overhead costs. This means that the team is well under normal industry rates and is compensated monthly in ABI. Currently we pay 1000 ABI per month to contributors and all of these are funded by the Abachi Labs treasury.\n\nSince we are reducing emissions and looking to put forth inverse bonds, everyone in the team and contributors has given a soft approval to lock their tokens which are paid as monthly compensation. They will now be paid in pABI instead of ABI which they can lock for veGABI.\n\nAll contributors are paid a USD portion also, which incentivizes them in short term.\n\nMethodology\nSimple change, just pay in pABI instead of ABI. No other changes as part of the proposal and payments are uniformly 100 pABI per core contributor per month.",

These contracts were all written inhouse.\n\nWork with a partner to bridge gABI to ethereum. Prefer to work with Synapse, however there are many options now.\n\nProvide emissions as incentives to these pools in OHM + ABI.\n\nDeploy LP on mainnet and incentivize it using our OHM + ABI emissions.\n\nOverall as we grow, this would also signal an intention to move more operations with a mainnet (ethereum) first approach.\n\nAs recommended by the community, this will be deployed in phases where phase 1 will only emit OHM emissions to boost APY.",

      "content": "Summary\nReduce APY to 60% on staked ABI. Total emissions will remain at 10 million. Use the remaining 40% emissions to incentivize LP pools, Lending Bond Markets (upcoming), Governance Voting\n\nMotivation\n\nAbachi relies partly on the rebase from OHM for revenues. With a reduction in place we also need to appropriately reduce emissions.\n\nThis proposal will allow the treasury and policy teams to target 60% APY on the staking app and an overall emissions control that ensures we do not exceed 100% APY.\n\n40% of the emissions will be routed to:\n\nLP Pools for Uniswap v3 gABI, sABI & ABI\nWe need to increase our liquidity and introduce new markets. Since launch due to market conditions, we have not been able to sell bonds to initiate these. The proposal is to delay no longer and launch these pools and use emissions to incentivize them.\n\nGovernance participation - Drop ABI to those who are active in governance. We are lucky a lot of people take active participation in governance, even in these slower than normal bear market days. We would however like to increase this. Community and governance require members to be active. They will be rewarded with emissions.\n\nWe are launching permissioned bond markets and have to now increase the TVL on our permissioned pools. Currently we have demand for 4% APY from our partners paid in real world fiat yields. This can probably go up to 6% however to attract a large sum of Capital in the start, we would like to incentivize this capital with ABI emissions. Increasing LP will allow us to more effectively implement this.\n\nMethodology\n\nPolicy team will use the set target function to bring the emissions lower in a 2 week period after the vote is held.",

      "content": "Summary\n\nExtension to ABIP-06. The treasury team is proposing we add Vesta Finance, GMX and GLP tokens into the productive assets whitelist\n\nAbstract\n\nThis proposal seeks to do two things:\n\nAdd vesta finance as whitelisted protocol for Abachi DAO to manage its liquidity treasury.\nAllow allocation to GLP and GMX to earn yields paid in ETH.\nTo achieve this, the treasury team will open a position in Vesta Finance with its gOHM holdings. Currently these sit at 40gOHM. The position will be actively monitored and collateralized at or above 300%. In case we see a drop in gOHM we will add collateral to bring the collateralization to 300%.\n\nWith the loan taken from Vesta Finance, Abachi will allocate 80% to the GLP token and 20% to the GMX token and stake them both to earn a yield. Currently 40% on GLP and 30% on GMX, paid in ETH and GMX.\n\nBoth these platforms are on Arbitrum. A multi-sig will also be created on arbitrum to manage these.\n\ntldr;\n\nTake 40 gOHM\nPut in vesta against 300% collateralised loan.\nSwap VST stablecoin for USD\nAllocate 80% to GLP and 20% to GMX\nCompound daily\nRisks:\ngOHM falls below collateral and our position on it gets liquidated.\n\nMitigation:\nThe position will be actively monitored.\n\nAdvantage & Hedge:\nThis also hedges our gOHM position in case there is a catastrophic platform / protocol failure at gOHM. While our initial position in vesta will be liquidated, the loan we took out will still be valid.\n\nMotivation\nWe do not want to sell our gOHM and while it sits in the treasury, it can be utilised in a much better way.\n\nThe treasury team in light of the recent hacks, depegs and other issues wants to both hedge this position and also make it more productive. GMX and GLP allow us to do this.\n\nAbout GLP:\nThis is an index token. Breakdown of the assets held in the underlying index can be viewed here:\nDashboard | Decentralized Perpetual Exchange | GMX 2\n\nAbout GMX token:\nThis is the underlying exchange token for GMX which earns yields paid in ETH (via fees) and GMX token.\n\nAbout GMX:\nhttps://twitter.com/0x21l/status/1509905348022648835?s=20&t=_cbTxk1Ys0UCOpJAf-iIcw ",

For this purpose a uniswap v3 Pool has been setup with an initial liquidity of 50k DAI, and the team will provide more if needed. The pABI liquidity is a concentrated pool and will guarantee a price of $1.4-1.6 per ABI.\n\nThe acquired pABI will be moved to the Team DAO wallet and provided to contributors over a three year locked period (no linear vesting).\n\nDue to the recent market downturn, some pABI holders had requested an exit. Given the stressed prices and to be fair to ABI holders, the price offered is much lower, however it allows them to sell the entire allocation without waiting for a three year unlock.\n\nMotivation\nThe team wants to align incentives with contributors and give them a much bigger locked stake in ABI. For this purpose the team is putting in funds to buy back the pABI at a discount.\n\nHow this helps us:\n\nWe can now offer a much bigger allocation to core contributors. Some of whom have recently joined us in marketing, sales & development.\n\nThe tokens will be unlocked in three years (when all pABI vest) so the long term incentives for contributors will also be locked regardless of market conditions.\n\nAllows an exit at discounted prices for those who need one.\n\nWhat will happen:\n\nAny pABI sold or traded on the uniswap pool will be locked for the entire three years.\n\nNo change for any pABI holder that does not sell into the pool or trade their token.\n\nAcquired pABI will be used to incentive new DAO members and give them a meaningful vote also.\n\nAllow any wallet holding pABI to vote at the same weight as regular ABI holder.\n\nAfter the three year unlock, each pABI may be directly redeemed for ABI with no backing or any other conditions.\n\nTreasury backing will not go down as the funds for buybacks are coming from the team wallet and not backing.",

For example we earn BAL, IMX and other tokens with yields.\n\nMotivation\nAfter discussion with many stakeholders based on ABIP-04. The team has decided to put in place a whitelist of assets and better accountability of what can and cannot be added.\n\nAs a general framework, the assets to acquire must possess the following properties:\n\nProvide deep liquidity or base asset pair (e.g. btc/eth/gOHM)\nProvide revenue to the treasury (CRV, CVX, OHM, BTRFLY)\nBe needed for operations (e.g. LINK, Matic)\nReserve Assets:\n75% of the treasury must always consist of the proposed reserve assets.\n25% of those reserve assets must always be in Stables.\n\nRevenue Assets:\nA maximum exposure of 2.5% of the total treasury value per asset.\n\ne.g. if Treasury is $100 we can only acquire $2.5 worth of btrfly max.\n\nAcquisition of Reserve & Revenue Assets\n\nReserve assets will be offered via bonds and re balancing the treasury. The assets if acquired via rebalancing will be acquired before any announcement is made to prevent front-running.\n\nAny new rebalancing, bonds or market buys will require both the treasury and policy teams to agree.",

      "title": "[ABIP-03] Reduction in total Supply & APY",
      "content": "Summary\nStudying recent market changes especially around rebase models, the treasury and policy teams have decided to put forth a proposal that will:\n\n1. Reduce total supply from 100 million to 10 million.\n2. Reduce APY to a more sustainable value to ensure at least 1 yr of runway.\n\nDrastically improve bonding incentives to grow the treasury.\nThis will effectively ensure the total supply is reduced by 10x & the APY will also come down to match the reduction in supply. The teams want to do this to ensure that the issuance of ABI always stay at a sustainable level with respect to the treasury.\n\nBecause of the rate of APY decrease, any speculators that want a higher piece of the overall supply will need to bond and cannot just rely on their staking stack\n\nThose who bond or buy early and stake will get the highest reward and marketcap of the overall Abachi that will ever exist\n\nAbstract\n\nThe team is proposing a reduction in supply to 10m from the earlier 100m supply Abachi planned to issue. The reduction in supply does not affect the project since the supply does not exist, however ensures that the token and price faces much less dilution.\n\nThis will be added to the smart contracts as a hard cap. Moreover the treasury also wants to ensure that the total emission schedule is over a period of 9 years without bonding. The only way to increase dilution (up to a maximum of 10m) is to be able to bond.\n\nWith the above it is also proposed that the APY be brought down to a much more sustainable level. This will ensure long term holders will still benefit the most, but shorter term price swings will not have an adverse affect on the community.\n\n1. Reduce total over mint possible from 100m to 10m.\n2. Reduce the total APY based on new framework given below.\n\nMotivation\n\nFirst:\nAbachi used the rebasing mechanism for token emissions instead of the traditional ICO method. However with this there is an expectation that the treasury also constantly increase (even though the products are not out). This pressure is increased as the total emissions and APY are high.\n\nAbachi was never meant to be a backing or reserve currency. When we reached out to Olympus DAO back in Nov, this was our pitch to them also. Albeit, we did ask for Olympus to buy the token (ABI) from us instead of us providing these tokens. New projects are now using this model, and we do think this will become a defacto way of fund raising, we can see projects now buying up seeds in other projects.\n\nWhile we in the team still think this is the best way to raise, where the control is with the market and the project that owns the liquidity, we do think we need to keep market expectations in check also. Not everyone will be staked for 1-3 years and a high emission will drive the price down at least initially as the treasury will not increase at the same rate.\n\nSecondly\nAbachi has a high conviction position in DeFi. This includes Olympus DAO. For us to be able to keep this conviction, it is important that the treasury be able to maximize in the assets it thinks will lead the future. To do this we will need to increase the treasury stable holdings. A lower APY and emission will allow more people to bond initially to capture market share and also become lucrative as APY drops.\n\nCurrent Treasury Distribution\n\nToken Treasury\nThe Main Abachi treasury that provides the minimal viable price for ABI is on L1 Eth under the abachi.eth wallet. Additionally 100k is also in separate team wallets being used on CRV, Vesta Finance & Balancer.\n\nAbachi owns 1m in this treasury without counting any LP positions. If the LP and the bond fees are included, the treasury currently sits at 1.5m.\n\nDev Treasury\nIn addition to above, Abachi also owns around 700k in stables which is used to pay for development & research. This amount was raised from pabi sales.\n\nDAO community treasury\n10,000 sABI is locked under the DAO treasury to be used for future initiatives.\n\nToken Distribution\n\nThe proposal does not change the token distribution in terms of percentage as the future tokens don't exist yet.\n\nPros\n\nReduces sell pressure significantly caused due to rebases\nIncreases runaway to our target (356 days)\nIncreases potential value of each ABI currently in circulation.\n\nCons\nAPY reduction may cause speculative shorter term holders to exit.",

This team will only handle the treasury used for minimal viable price of the protocol, as also shown on the dashboard. Partner & DAO treasuries will fall under different multi-sigs. However those funds are not included in the current dashboard.\n\nAbstract:\nThe keys to main contracts need to be moved away from single deployers to multi-sigs. Initially we needed to ensure the protocol goes live and runs as smoothly as possible, which given data we are confident we have achieved.\n\nThe multi-sig will be a 3/5 signer to start, and all major decisions regarding the protocol falls under this role.\n\nMotivation:\nTo increase security, we need to move contract ownership to multiple individual teams. Two major teams will be formed for this.\nPolicy / Guardian\nGovernor / Treasury\n\nThe governor role is the most important role as this one controls the funds in the main treasury and also can change reward rate and other parameters. Each governor will also carry an NFT issued at a later stage which will give them a higher voting power than most others.\n\nA governor can be voted out by a unanimous vote by the governor team (excluding the one being voted out) or a majority vote between the policy and governor teams.\n\nGovernors can also be voted out by a 65% general vote on snapshot.\n\nJob of the governors:\n\nRecommend reward rate reductions based on treasury assets.\nRecommend treasury assets for acquisition and sale.\nProvide a framework on how these assets are bought & sold.\nExecute & change any other roles e.g. Policy.\nManage withdrawals and deposits into the main treasury.\nThe proposed five initial governors are:\n\nelecto - Has experience in markets dating back to 2014. Has been a part of various trading groups in the past including Whalepool. He is also one of the biggest seed round contributors buying ABI at $15. Part of the core team and cofounder. electo is also a major shareholder of Luca+ and currently the one executing trades for Abachi.\n\nrand - Core team and cofounder. Has won various hackathons throughout the years. Understands markets & code equally well. Writes smart contracts & bots for fun. Has also worked on Crypto Stats which is one of the biggest data aggregators around all markets. He is also one of the biggest seed round contributors buying ABI at $15.\n\nHmZ - We consider her core team, but she is a week 1 seed contributor. One of the biggest unlocked ABI holder. She has gone above and beyond in the community, giving away her own ABI to help people learn. She also brings real-world common sense to the team.\n\nSasha - Advisor to Abachi, and has also invested a sizeable portion in early seed for ABI. He is the founder of creaton, and understand the DeFi space very well. Has been instrumental in helping with marketing and partnerships.\n\nP-One - Core member of the team and handles Ops and security for Abachi. Software engineer at core and he already handles all IT infrastructure deployed. He is also our representative for upcoming Azure and AWS sponsorships.\n\nPros:\n\nIncreases security of the protocol.\nCons:\n\nNA",

      "content": "\nSummary: \nAllow the treasury to allocate up to 1% of its assets into purchasing and staking MTA. This will increase our yields on Stable Coins in mStable pools. ($25,000)\n\nAbstract: \nAbachi would like to stake the recently acquired MTA in the mstable V2 staking contract. This will yield both more MTA as rewards and allow Abachi to have a governing voice in mStable. Abachi is acquiring MTA to be able to divert the emissions controller to the pools it favors which increase yields for the 50% stables it keeps in its treasury.\n\nThe stables are divided into multiple treasuries on Ethereum and Polygon Gnosis wallets. For this Abachi is working with mStable team to whitelist the gnosis address and allow staking.\n\nBoth Abachi and mStable will also issue a press release on their blogs announcing this. \n\nOnce this is done, Abachi will open a new proposal for both parties to introduce mUSD as the primary stable to use. This proposal will be posted later when all the mechanics have been worked out.\n\nMotivation:\nTeam wants to only keep yield producing assets in its treasury. Since 50% of the treasury is at all times in stables, the governance and policy need to ensure this is producing yields. Abachi has moved 1m of  its treasury into these pools across polygon and ethereum and is currently earning a yield of 10-15% paid in USD and MTA.\n\nThe team strongly believes in a time of CRV wars the mStable platform is a dark horse. \n\nPros:\n- Increase yields on a highly audited and reputed platform.\n- Ability to gain a strong voice in mStable governance.\n- Increase yields on stable pools and possibly divert the emission controller in the future to pay yields for an mUSD-ABI LP.\n- Increases treasury $ value as MTA being held increases.\n- Joint marketing and partnerships\n\nCons:\n- As with all systems there is a smart contract risk, or that one of the underlying assets in the mStable basket loses peg. In this case mStable has a slashing mechanism in place.\n- The price of mStable keeps dropping. Currently its near its all time lows. The initial purchase is however only $25000\n\n\nNOTE: Abachi and mStable are currently working on a joint press release regarding this and the mstable team will also be voting on this in their own governance. In case the vote fails on either side, we will unwind our MTA position. \n\n",
