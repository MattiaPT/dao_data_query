      "title": "[RE] DREAM DAO PROPOSAL #77: Addressing Unapproved and Quorum Failed DAO Proposals",
      "content": "### üéØ**Goals:**\n- Establish a procedure to follow in the event that a proposal in the DAO is not approved or does not reach the necessary quorum.\n- Reiterate the process that the DAO follows regarding ideas and proposals.\n\n### üèãÔ∏è**Point of Contact:**\n> santiagocruz__, naomiborzani & ximenahj\n\n### üí°**Description:**\nPreviously in the DAO, a procedure was established for handling ideas generated for future processes and proposals, allowing them to be discussed before formalizing them as proposals with all voting members of the DAO. This process can be consulted here ‚Ä£. This process has worked well, and we know that it has been the best so far, as it provides time for everyone to reflect on and contribute to the proposal. However, this process does not address possible scenarios that have occurred in the DAO and may happen again regarding the outcome of the voting process.\n\nCurrently in the DAO, if a proposal reaches the necessary quorum and is approved, everything is perfect! We continue to grow and improve our systems for better functioning in daily operations. However, when a proposal does not reach the necessary quorum, it is relaunched, with the hope that it will now achieve the quorum. This process has not been successful and can be due to various factors (something may have been left incomplete in the proposal, there was not enough time to read and provide feedback, voting members were unable to vote, etc.). Whatever the reason, relaunching the proposal is not a good process to follow. That is why the following two scenarios and procedures are proposed in case either of these situations recurs in the DAO:\n\n> **Scenario 1: \"The proposal does not meet the necessary quorum, regardless of the outcome.\"**\n\nIn the event that a proposal in the DAO does not reach the necessary quorum, regardless of the outcome, an additional week will be given to discuss the proposal and determine if there are still changes to be made.\n\nAfter the week, it will be relaunched for voting. If it still does not reach the necessary quorum, the DAO Council will be responsible for deciding whether to approve the proposal or not, promptly stating the reasons for their decision and being open to receiving any comments or suggestions.\n\n> **Scenario 2: \"The proposal meets the necessary quorum but is not approved by the DAO.\"**\n\nIf a proposal in the DAO is not approved, it must wait at least two weeks before relaunching the idea, and it will follow the process described in ‚Ä£ , highlighting all changes in the new proposal, which should have been made in accordance with the feedback provided by the DAO Council.\n\nIf the proposal is not approved for a second instance, it cannot be presented again for a vote because it is assumed that the DAO, for the most part, does not agree with the new changes. In the event that Scenario 1 happens within the second opportunity described in this case (i.e., when relaunching the proposal does not reach the necessary quorum), the process of Scenario 1 should be followed.\n\n> **Scenario 3: \"The proposal meets the necessary quorum but the result is abstention by a majority of the voters‚Äù.**\n\nWe can consider this scenario analogous to Scenario 2 as there must be a reason why the DAO members did not approve it and instead of voting against it, they decided to abstain. For this scenario the same process of Scenario 2 will be followed. Following this we can say that there is enough time to make modifications and re-launch the proposal.\n\n### üóìÔ∏è**Duration:**\nUpon approval of the proposal\n\n### üí∞**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**\nN/A\n\n### üí∏**Token Distribution: (Sponsors‚Äô control)**\nN/A",

Everything is TBD!\n\n### üí≠ Scope\n- Bootcamp applications open\n- Builders applications open\n- S1-S2 builders join the Rangers Program\n- S3-S4 builders join the integration program\n- S3-S4 builders start the Perpetual Explorers Program\n- Exploration Path starts in November until December\n- S3-S4 builders graduate from the PEP and join the Rangers Program\n\n1. With membership renewal, all builders from **Season 1 and Season 2** join the **Rangers Program:**\n\nThe Rangers Program offers further opportunities for growth and impact. Builders will have the opportunity to join the Rangers Program, which offers further opportunities for growth and impact. This will help sustain the cycle of learning and mentorship within the DAO.\n\nThe Rangers Program will focus on supporting Champions and Builders through bounties and impact projects that are place-based. This will provide both of them with the opportunity to continue their growth and make a significant impact in the web3 x social impact space.\n\n**The main activities will be:**\n\n- Advocate for the DAO\n- Mentor younger Builders and even new Champions (why not? adults also need mentors!).\n- Host LTs and Treks\n- Work on projects, on-the-ground impact (use The Citizen App) etc\n\n**********************The future:**********************\n\nWith the success of this program, we can, in the future, go after funds to distribute to Builders and Champs in the Rangers Program so they can focus on working on their personal impact projects within the web3 ecosystem.\n\n1. Builders from S3 + S4 will participate in the **Integration Program (2 weeks max).**\n\nThe Integration Program will present the DAO to new builders, help them to meet the community, find the best people to grow relationships with, and most importantly, help them to design the pathway they wanna work on during the **Explorers Program.**\n\n1. After the Integration program, Builders join the **Perpetual Explorers Program:**\n\nThe Explorers Program has been a cornerstone of our learning and development initiatives. However, we've identified a need for continuous learning opportunities beyond the current structure of the program. To address this, we are transforming the Explorers Program into a **continuous initiative**.\n\nThis new structure will provide a consistent platform for learning and growth, keeping builders engaged and continuously developing their skills in the web3 x social impact space. It will offer a range of learning opportunities, from web3 basics to advanced topics, ensuring that our builders are always at the forefront of the web3 x social impact ecosystem.\n\nThe program will be structured around a series of modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of web3 x social impact. Builders will have the opportunity to work on real-world projects, apply their learning, and receive feedback from mentors and peers.\n\n**The main activities will be:**\n\n- Group study sessions (these will work like Juntos/Study Groups and will be divided into 3 (**technical learning** for those interested in coding, **research** for those interested in conducting self-paced research on a certain topic, and **theory** for those who want to learn more and more about the web3 concepts, from basic to expert levels). S1 + S2 builders can choose to participate if they want!\n- *Exploration Path*.

      "title": "DREAM DAO PROPOSAL #77: Addressing Unapproved and Quorum Failed DAO Proposals",
      "content": "### üéØ**Goals:**\n- Establish a procedure to follow in the event that a proposal in the DAO is not approved or does not reach the necessary quorum.\n- Reiterate the process that the DAO follows regarding ideas and proposals.\n\n### üèãÔ∏è**Point of Contact:**\n> santiagocruz__, naomiborzani & ximenahj\n\n### üí°**Description:**\nPreviously in the DAO, a procedure was established for handling ideas generated for future processes and proposals, allowing them to be discussed before formalizing them as proposals with all voting members of the DAO. This process can be consulted here ‚Ä£. This process has worked well, and we know that it has been the best so far, as it provides time for everyone to reflect on and contribute to the proposal. However, this process does not address possible scenarios that have occurred in the DAO and may happen again regarding the outcome of the voting process.\n\nCurrently in the DAO, if a proposal reaches the necessary quorum and is approved, everything is perfect! We continue to grow and improve our systems for better functioning in daily operations. However, when a proposal does not reach the necessary quorum, it is relaunched, with the hope that it will now achieve the quorum. This process has not been successful and can be due to various factors (something may have been left incomplete in the proposal, there was not enough time to read and provide feedback, voting members were unable to vote, etc.). Whatever the reason, relaunching the proposal is not a good process to follow. That is why the following two scenarios and procedures are proposed in case either of these situations recurs in the DAO:\n\n> **Scenario 1: \"The proposal does not meet the necessary quorum, regardless of the outcome.\"**\n\nIn the event that a proposal in the DAO does not reach the necessary quorum, regardless of the outcome, an additional week will be given to discuss the proposal and determine if there are still changes to be made.\n\nAfter the week, it will be relaunched for voting. If it still does not reach the necessary quorum, the DAO Council will be responsible for deciding whether to approve the proposal or not, promptly stating the reasons for their decision and being open to receiving any comments or suggestions.\n\n> **Scenario 2: \"The proposal meets the necessary quorum but is not approved by the DAO.\"**\n\nIf a proposal in the DAO is not approved, it must wait at least two weeks before relaunching the idea, and it will follow the process described in ‚Ä£ , highlighting all changes in the new proposal, which should have been made in accordance with the feedback provided by the DAO Council.\n\nIf the proposal is not approved for a second instance, it cannot be presented again for a vote because it is assumed that the DAO, for the most part, does not agree with the new changes. In the event that Scenario 1 happens within the second opportunity described in this case (i.e., when relaunching the proposal does not reach the necessary quorum), the process of Scenario 1 should be followed.\n\n> **Scenario 3: \"The proposal meets the necessary quorum but the result is abstention by a majority of the voters‚Äù.**\n\nWe can consider this scenario analogous to Scenario 2 as there must be a reason why the DAO members did not approve it and instead of voting against it, they decided to abstain. For this scenario the same process of Scenario 2 will be followed. Following this we can say that there is enough time to make modifications and re-launch the proposal.\n\n### üóìÔ∏è**Duration:**\nUpon approval of the proposal\n\n### üí∞**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**\nN/A\n\n### üí∏**Token Distribution: (Sponsors‚Äô control)**\nN/A",

With membership renewal, all builders from **Season 1 and Season 2** join the **Rangers Program:**\n\nThe Rangers Program offers further opportunities for growth and impact. Builders will have the opportunity to join the Rangers Program, which offers further opportunities for growth and impact. This will help sustain the cycle of learning and mentorship within the DAO.\n\nThe Rangers Program will focus on supporting Champions and Builders through bounties and impact projects that are place-based. This will provide both of them with the opportunity to continue their growth and make a significant impact in the web3 x social impact space.\n\n**The main activities will be:**\n\n- Advocate for the DAO\n- Mentor younger Builders and even new Champions (why not? adults also need mentors!).\n- Host LTs and Treks\n- Work on projects, on-the-ground impact (use The Citizen App) etc\n\n**********************The future:**********************\n\nWith the success of this program, we can, in the future, go after funds to distribute to Builders and Champs in the Rangers Program so they can focus on working on their personal impact projects within the web3 ecosystem.\n\n1. Builders from S3 + S4 will participate in the **Integration Program (2 weeks max).**\n\nThe Integration Program will present the DAO to new builders, help them to meet the community, find the best people to grow relationships with, and most importantly, help them to design the pathway they wanna work on during the **Explorers Program.**\n\n1. After the Integration program, Builders join the **Perpetual Explorers Program:**\n\nThe Explorers Program has been a cornerstone of our learning and development initiatives. However, we've identified a need for continuous learning opportunities beyond the current structure of the program. To address this, we are transforming the Explorers Program into a **continuous initiative**.\n\nThis new structure will provide a consistent platform for learning and growth, keeping builders engaged and continuously developing their skills in the web3 x social impact space. It will offer a range of learning opportunities, from web3 basics to advanced topics, ensuring that our builders are always at the forefront of the web3 x social impact ecosystem.\n\nThe program will be structured around a series of modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of web3 x social impact. Builders will have the opportunity to work on real-world projects, apply their learning, and receive feedback from mentors and peers.\n\n**The main activities will be:**\n\n- Group study sessions (these will work like Juntos/Study Groups and will be divided into 3 (**technical learning** for those interested in coding, **research** for those interested in conducting self-paced research on a certain topic, and **theory** for those who want to learn more and more about the web3 concepts, from basic to expert levels). S1 + S2 builders can choose to participate if they want!\n- *Exploration Path*.

      "title": "[RE] DREAM DAO PROPOSAL #75: Membership Renewal Process for Dream DAO Voting Members",
      "content": "### üéØ**Goals:**\n\n- Create a system to be used during each season transition for renewing the memberships of voting members.\n- Identify how many voting members we will have each Season of the DAO.\n- Re-engage members of the DAO.\n- Off-board unengaged members of the DAO.\n\n### üèãÔ∏è**Point of Contact:**\n>santiagocruz__\n\n### üí°**Description:**\n\nCurrently, Dream DAO has experienced three successful seasons in its existence. This has been a significant achievement for our community, as we have onboarded a total of 168 Voting Members into the DAO, with 110 Builders and 58 Champions. Thanks to these figures, we have positioned ourselves as a diverse, inclusive, and Gen Z-oriented DAO that aims to onboard and drive positive change for humanity through the intersection of web3 and social impact.\n\nBeing honest, it's pointless for the DAO to state that we have +150 Active Voting Members if this isn't demonstrated. Several scenarios highlight this, including the Learning Together Sessions, active participation in the Working Groups, events, and public spaces of Dream DAO, etc. One thing is to say that we have onboarded +100 Gen Z to web3 than to say that we are +100 Active Builders and that we are +50 active Champions to +50 Champions that have given support and assistance to Builders.\n\nDespite these figures, a significant portion of these Builders and Champions remain committed to the DAO, while others do not. Due to this, Dream DAO introduced a Renewal Process solution during Season 1 where, instead of expelling specific members, if members do not complete the renewal process, their membership will expire. Following this previously implemented approach and based on the reasons stated, the purpose of this proposal is to establish a universal system called the \"Membership Renewal Process for Voting Members.\" This system will be implemented prior to the conclusion of each season in Dream DAO to ascertain how many members remain committed to the DAO, thereby welcoming new Builders and Champions accordingly.\n\n**What will the process entail?**\n\nTo maintain a simple and accessible process for everyone, it will be carried out in two distinct phases. This process will serve as an opportunity for members to reflect on whether they wish to renew their membership and contribute to the DAO in each subsequent season. \n\nüö® **Under no circumstances can any active member of the DAO exempt themselves from this process; all members must undergo it if they wish to renew their membership.**\n\nTo renew their membership, each member of Dream DAO must:\n\n1. **Complete the \"Dream DAO Season Retrospection Form.‚Äù**\n- The form will be created and reviewed by the Governance Working Group, and validated by the DAO Council.\n- The form will be sent to all voting members via email and will be posted on Discord along with a timeline specifying the duration during which members will have to complete it.\n1. **Participate in the DAO by engaging in its events or proposals.**\n- The Governance Working Group will provide a schedule in which, over a period of two weeks, members will engage in at least one of the following ways:\n    - Attend any DAO-wide session (Learning Together Session, Hangout, or Retro Session).\n    - Attend the final session of their respective Working Groups (which will encompass a comprehensive review of the WG's achievements throughout the Season).\n    - Participate in one of the Twitter Spaces events scheduled at the end of the Season.\n\nüö® **The event or proposal will be chosen by the Governance Working Group in collaboration with the DAO Council, and it may involve one or more events over the proposed two-week period. If there isn't ample time for this, the DAO Council will decide on an approach that is accessible to all and demonstrates commitment and a desire to renew membership.**\n\n**What will happen to members who choose not to renew their membership?**\n\nMembers who decide not to renew their membership for another season in Dream DAO might do so due to various factors, which could include:\n\n- Not meeting the requirements for the type of membership they are renewing.\n- Successfully integrating into the ecosystem and finding their place within it.\n- Not having enough time to contribute due to personal responsibilities.\n- Not finding their fit within the DAO or the ecosystem and not wishing to continue as voting members in the DAO.\n\nWhatever their decision may be, we can't bid them farewell (indeed, no one in Dream DAO wants that), as everyone has been a vital part of shaping what Dream DAO is today. **For this reason, members who choose not to renew their membership will have their roles identifying them as Voting Members removed and will be granted the \"Dream DAO Veteran\" role.** This role is dedicated to highlighting their experience and time invested in the community, underscoring their status as former voting members.

      "content": "üéØGoals:\nUpdate the Recurring Roles and their Selection System.\n\nüèãÔ∏èPoint of Contact:\nsantiagocruz__\n\nüí°Description:\nOne of the objectives of Dream DAO during Season 4 is to continue growing and enhancing the processes and systems managed within the DAO. The Governance Working Group's key result is to assess the ongoing relevance of the existing Recurring Roles in the DAO and determine if the current incumbents are effectively fulfilling their responsibilities and remain committed to doing so during Season 4.\nCurrently, Dream DAO comprises 8 Recurring Roles, which are outlined in the following table:\n\n[Recurring Role Description](https://www.notion.so/dreamdao/Proposal-to-Update-Recurring-Roles-36d1f4855a2245bbb6a1f7883545d19f?pvs=4#053d75b1729145f1b1d6be04fc1d82e5)\n\nAfter a discussion with the recurring roles and a review of the essentials of each role and consideration of including the work of the Working Groups, it is felt that the 8 recurring roles are necessary and vital to keep our Dream DAO operations functioning and operating.\n\nüí°All the Recurring Roles will enter in this proposal except Social Media Coordinator as we need to be more careful with the process for this one since is more specific when it comes to skills, etc. It doesn‚Äôt have to be necessarily someone from the DAO and someone was recently elected.\n\nüí∞Recurring Roles are being paid 20 USD x hour.\nDuring the first session of the Governance Working Group, a proposal was made to change the selection structure for Recurring Roles, integrating them into the Election Process for each season's role renewal. This implies that Recurring Roles would now be renewed every six months, alongside the Co-Stewards and Working Group Leads. The election process would remain the same as it has been thus far, allowing anyone to apply, including current role holders who could reapply using this new method. This approach serves as both a confirmation of their continued interest in retaining the role for another season and a reward mechanism for timely and effective performance.\n\nüóìÔ∏èDuration:\nIf this proposal is approved, it would be applicable for Season 5. During the current Season 4, a check-in in the form of forms would be conducted to determine if voting members currently holding recurring roles will have the opportunity to continue with them until the end of the season, contingent on fulfilling their responsibilities and weekly updates. In the event that a new election is required to fill a vacant role, it will be conducted promptly, with the Governance Working Group overseeing the process. It is anticipated that a new voting member will be elected within a timeframe of less than two weeks.\n\nüí∞Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)\nN/A\n\nüí∏Token Distribution: (Sponsors‚Äô control)\nN/A",

      "content": "üéØ**Goals:**\n1. Improve the voting process by implementing new changes in the agreement process.\n2. Increase voter turnout\n\nüèãÔ∏è**Point of Contact:**\n> **Lewis Base#5631 &  Adarsh#8282**\n\nüí°**Description:**\n> The proposal outlines changes to the current voting process in Dream DAO, including extending the feedback period, allowing a reworking phase, shifting the voting time, and encouraging active involvement.\n> \n\nObjective:\n- Improve the voting process\n- Increase voter turnout\n\nIntroduction:\nProposals are crucial for the functioning of our DAO, as every major decision by the DAO needs to be first approved by the community. A quorum is essential to implement proposals, even those with broad consensus. Dream DAO has recently faced challenges in reaching a quorum for proposal voting. To address this, the Governance WG proposes the following changes to the current voting process:\n\n| Current Process | Proposed Changes |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Monday] Call for Comments Mail | [Monday] Call for Comments Mail/Call for Vote Mail |\n| [Monday to Thursday] Discussion and Feedback period. | [Monday to Friday] Discussion and Feedback period |\n| [Friday] Call for Vote Mail | [Friday to Sunday] Time to implement feedback |\n| [Monday] Voting Ends | [Monday] Voting starts; it will be sent with upcoming braindumps. |\n\nProposed Solution:\n\n1. Extend the feedback period to Friday, providing more time for members to engage with proposals and give valuable suggestions.\n2. Allow a reworking phase (Friday to Sunday) for proposers to incorporate feedback and finalize the proposal before voting.\n3. Shift the voting time to Monday, allowing members who unplug during the weekend to participate in the voting process. This will also allow us to batch up the Call for Comments and Call for Vote emails.\n4. Encourage active involvement in the DAO by discussing the importance of voting in Discord conversations and reminding members of their responsibilities.\n\nSince this is the first proposal that discusses the process (since Proposal #11), we would also like to use it to codify and reaffirm a few related things.\n\n1. For a draft proposal to be sent out in the Call for Comments Mail, it needs to be sent to the Agreements Coordinator on or before Sunday, 23:59 UTC. Any proposal submitted after this will be sent out the following week (unless the Agreement Coordinator decides otherwise).\n2. The Agreements Coordinator must send out the Call for Comments and Call for Voting Mail every week before Monday, 19:00 UTC (if any proposals need to be sent out for comments or voting). The agreements Coordinator may (with prior notice) change these times to ones that are more convenient for their time zone.\n3. If the DAO Council decides that a proposal is very time sensitive, it can choose to expedite the process and reduce the time for comments. Such a change needs to be clearly conveyed in the Call for Comments email.\n4. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, only one Call for Comments/Call for Voting mail will be sent every week.\n5. Each draft proposal needs to have a small blurb that summarizes what the proposal is about. For example, a suitable blurb for this proposal might be:\n    - ‚ÄúThis proposal aims to improve voting processes and increase voter turnout by amending the current agreements process.‚Äù\n    \n The email will include these summaries when the proposal is sent out for feedback/vote.\n\nBy implementing these proposed changes, we aim to improve the voting process in the Dream DAO, encourage more active participation among members, and ensure that the quorum is met for all proposals. This will facilitate smooth and efficient decision-making, benefiting the entire organization!\n\nüíö**Benefits:**\n- The improved voting process\n- Increased member engagement\n- Ensured quorum for all proposals\n- Facilitated smooth and efficient decision-making\n\nüìà**Success Metrics:**\n1. Quorum met consistently for all proposals\n2. Increased voter turnout\n\nüóìÔ∏è**Duration:**\n- Start: Implementation upon approval\n- End: Ongoing\n\nüí∞**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**\n- None",

Defining the Social Coordinator Role\n2. Outlining the application process to fill this role position.\n\n## 1. **Social Coordinator Role:**\nAfter reading and processing the discussion on the Twitter Guardian Evolution thread the following areas were highlighted. Here are some proposed solutions and how they protect the DD budget.\nhttps://www.notion.so/cucrew/DREAM-DAO-PROPOSAL-68-Social-Media-Coordinator-75c416f35b5a4fdaac82bd53f6b45541#e95f8fe25ff14bfcb098dbfdb10d0d2c\n\n\n## Role Requirements:\nWith this knowledge the proposed role criteria may look like this (parts in itaItalic are taken from the original role proposal by Bear (Marco)#8146):\n\n- _The Twitter guardian will post original Tweets and some retweets depending on what‚Äôs going on every working day (100 every month/ not to be exact), following a flexible monthly strategy linked to the goals and priorities of the DAO._ For example, this may look like 1 original tweet and between 2-4 Retweets a day depending on appropriate retweet content being available.\n- _Keep a specific list of social media relationships with people who know Dream DAO updated (list is found within the Twitter account)._ This includes updating the list with new DAO Builders/Champions and tightly associated projects monthly.\n- Maintain a Twitter content schedule that runs 2-weeks ahead of the posting schedule. It will:\n    - Contain as much details of the actually to-be posted content as possible. When the exact posting content isn‚Äôt available yet, give details of the type/general idea of the content to be posted.\n    - Be sent to the Co-steward‚Äôs each week to be checked over. This will ensure the content is of a high enough standard to represent the organization on this key social media platform. If the content is consistently of a very high standard in areas like grammar, content focus, layout etc, the DAO Council can choose to remove this need (evaluated earliest after 2 months).\n- Monthly meeting with Co-stewards and SMC. This discussion will\n    - Allow the SMC to provide some basic metrics from Twitter to give insight into the success from socials that month, allowing for any adjustments to strategy needed to be discussed\n    - Help prioritise events/members/areas to highlight on Twitter\n\n## **Application process:**\n\n- **Why have an application?**\n    \n    The Twitter guardian role had an initial trial period between November and December 2022. Now this period is over it feels appropriate to carry out an official application for this role, allowing all DAO members a fair chance at this opportunity. The application will ask candidates to submit some example tweets and content following a guidance document, allowing the new candidates to be judged on their merit and skill for the role (as was seen to be effective recently for deciding who would run the DD Bootcamp).\n    \n    Application questions may follow this loose plan below (Application questions to be finalized by DD Council and turned into a submission form)\n    \n- **Who can apply?**\n    \n    **Any member of the DAO is free to apply for this position.** Strong applicants will have a good understanding of the DreamDAO project and have some experience relevant to this position.  \n    \n\n**Application Layout:**\n1. Please create two Twitter threads (with 4 sections each) focusing on highlighting internal achievements/happenings/members within our DreamDAO organization.\n- **These might include‚Ä¶**\n   \n    Featuring a Builder (their photo, their interests, what they are working on in web3, etc) \n    Overviewing a way we just leveled up our DAO\n    Highlighting big DAO milestones, like our bootcamp!\n    Announcing new role positions and member cohorts\n    Sharing big questions we are thinking through / things we are trying to figure out in our DAO\n    \n    E.g. Thread 1:\n    \n    - Section 1: Introduce the achievement/event/member and provide some context\n    - Section 2: Explain the impact of the achievement/event/member on our organization\n    - Section 3: Share any numbers or statistics that showcase the success of the achievement/event/member\n    - Section 4: Conclude by thanking the team or individuals involved and encourage others to follow our progress\n    \n1. Please show 2 example comments you would make on a relevant project/organization/persons posts that promotes growth within 1. The web3 community and 2.

Defining the Social Coordinator Role\n2. Outlining the application process to fill this role position.\n\n## 1. **Social Coordinator Role:**\nAfter reading and processing the discussion on the Twitter Guardian Evolution thread the following areas were highlighted. Here are some proposed solutions and how they protect the DD budget.\nhttps://www.notion.so/cucrew/DREAM-DAO-PROPOSAL-68-Social-Media-Coordinator-75c416f35b5a4fdaac82bd53f6b45541#e95f8fe25ff14bfcb098dbfdb10d0d2c\n\n\n## Role Requirements:\nWith this knowledge the proposed role criteria may look like this (parts in itaItalic are taken from the original role proposal by Bear (Marco)#8146):\n\n- _The Twitter guardian will post original Tweets and some retweets depending on what‚Äôs going on every working day (100 every month/ not to be exact), following a flexible monthly strategy linked to the goals and priorities of the DAO._ For example, this may look like 1 original tweet and between 2-4 Retweets a day depending on appropriate retweet content being available.\n- _Keep a specific list of social media relationships with people who know Dream DAO updated (list is found within the Twitter account)._ This includes updating the list with new DAO Builders/Champions and tightly associated projects monthly.\n- Maintain a Twitter content schedule that runs 2-weeks ahead of the posting schedule. It will:\n    - Contain as much details of the actually to-be posted content as possible. When the exact posting content isn‚Äôt available yet, give details of the type/general idea of the content to be posted.\n    - Be sent to the Co-steward‚Äôs each week to be checked over. This will ensure the content is of a high enough standard to represent the organization on this key social media platform. If the content is consistently of a very high standard in areas like grammar, content focus, layout etc, the DAO Council can choose to remove this need (evaluated earliest after 2 months).\n- Monthly meeting with Co-stewards and SMC. This discussion will\n    - Allow the SMC to provide some basic metrics from Twitter to give insight into the success from socials that month, allowing for any adjustments to strategy needed to be discussed\n    - Help prioritise events/members/areas to highlight on Twitter\n\n## **Application process:**\n\n- **Why have an application?**\n    \n    The Twitter guardian role had an initial trial period between November and December 2022. Now this period is over it feels appropriate to carry out an official application for this role, allowing all DAO members a fair chance at this opportunity. The application will ask candidates to submit some example tweets and content following a guidance document, allowing the new candidates to be judged on their merit and skill for the role (as was seen to be effective recently for deciding who would run the DD Bootcamp).\n    \n    Application questions may follow this loose plan below (Application questions to be finalized by DD Council and turned into a submission form)\n    \n- **Who can apply?**\n    \n    **Any member of the DAO is free to apply for this position.** Strong applicants will have a good understanding of the DreamDAO project and have some experience relevant to this position.  \n    \n\n**Application Layout:**\n1. Please create two Twitter threads (with 4 sections each) focusing on highlighting internal achievements/happenings/members within our DreamDAO organization.\n- **These might include‚Ä¶**\n   \n    Featuring a Builder (their photo, their interests, what they are working on in web3, etc) \n    Overviewing a way we just leveled up our DAO\n    Highlighting big DAO milestones, like our bootcamp!\n    Announcing new role positions and member cohorts\n    Sharing big questions we are thinking through / things we are trying to figure out in our DAO\n    \n    E.g. Thread 1:\n    \n    - Section 1: Introduce the achievement/event/member and provide some context\n    - Section 2: Explain the impact of the achievement/event/member on our organization\n    - Section 3: Share any numbers or statistics that showcase the success of the achievement/event/member\n    - Section 4: Conclude by thanking the team or individuals involved and encourage others to follow our progress\n    \n1. Please show 2 example comments you would make on a relevant project/organization/persons posts that promotes growth within 1. The web3 community and 2. The wider space of outside of web3 relevant to DD.\n2. Please provide screenshot examples of 4 posts you would retweet from the DreamDAO Twitter account.\n3. Please highlight any prior experience and skills you posses that are relevant to the Social Coordinator position.\n\n**Skills relevant to the Social Coordinator role:**\n\n- Strong written communication skills\n- Familiarity with social media platforms, particularly Twitter\n- Experience in content creation and curation\n- Knowledge of web3 and decentralized technology\n- Ability to stay organized and manage multiple tasks effectively\n- Strong attention to detail and ability to proofread and edit content\n\n**Some things to consider when making DD Twitter content:**\n\n- Keep it concise and to the point\n- Engage with other users by asking questions, responding to comments, and retweeting relevant content\n- Use eye-catching images and videos (when possible) to grab attention\n- Try to stay engaged with current DD related events and industry news to inform your content. Remember, this may be within and outside of web3.\n\nüóìÔ∏è**Duration:**\n- Start: February/March dependent on proposal processing and application submission and evaluation window.\n- End: Chosen by DAO Council, applications can start again if the chosen person is no longer able to handle the role or is not carrying out the role to the standard outlined above.\n\nüí∞**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**\n- 500 USDC / Month\n- Hours: Up to 7/ Week (29/Month **maximum**)",

      "title": "DREAM DAO PROPOSAL #66: Payment of Season 2 Recurring Roles in Season 3",
      "content": "üéØ**Goals:**\n\nThis new proposal has 2 objectives:\n\n- Hourly rate update for recurring roles that began at the start of season 2 in the DAO.\n- Reward the experience gained by builders who play a recurring role since the beginning of Season 2 with a fairer and more standardized compensation.\n\nüèãÔ∏è**Point of Contact:**\n> Joshua Cruz#3142\n\nüí°**Description:**\nAfter 6 months of the creation of the Recurring Roles in Dream DAO at the beginning of Season 2, the people who have maintained one of these roles have been working and carrying out each role with their respective responsibilities and key results. Many of them (thanks to the Dream DAO opportunity) have gained a lot of experience and have improved the skills that they use every time when performing the work they do in the DAO; this in turn is beneficial for those who maintain the role, as Dream DAO offers them the opportunity to gain work experience and to define their future plans and goals both for the DAO and personally.\n\nIn addition, this has led them to perform the work better and more efficiently than before, resulting in them spending considerably less time on it, which is great for the DAO as this is one of the main reasons why the recurring roles were created in the beginning (you can find the first document of the creation/payment of the recurring roles here [Paying Recurring Roles ](https://www.notion.so/Paying-Recurring-Roles-bb7da01ce5c243ce852ccb4aace8008b)). \n\nSome of the people who have a recurring role say:\n\n- ‚ÄúI‚Äôve definitely gotten more efficient as I‚Äôve gained experience. I‚Äôve standardised procedures, messages, and processes‚Äù.\n- ‚ÄúCurrently thanks to the experience I have been able to create processes that make me more efficient and therefore the time spent is less and better each time.‚Äù\n- ‚ÄúThe time investment has reduced. From last three months, the hours spent has reduced to half.‚Äù\n\nFor this reason, I propose to update the payments of the recurring roles that started at the beginning of Season 2 in the DAO to be paid at a rate of $20 USD/hour as a standard, this with the objective of rewarding the effort, time invested in learning, performing and compensating the experience acquired to the builder that performs a recurring role.\n\n<aside>\nüí° To get a clearer picture of how this would not significantly affect our treasury and how it compensates the builders involved, the following example taken from a recurring role is described:\n\nAt the beginning of season 2, I was spending 7 hours a month on my recurring role. After 3 months I was doing the same tasks and responsibilities in 4 hours, which says that my work decreased by 3 hours and it has been like that since then until now.\n\nIf we propose 20 USD/hour and the person keeps working 4 hours per month (even less this season), this person will be earning 80 USD/month (12 USD more with the $17 hourly rate but 39 USD less since this person saves 3 hours of the work time due to gained experience).\n\nThis ensures that the budget is not brutally increased and is compensated in a fairer way.\n</aside>\n\nThe recurring roles that would be included in this proposal are:\n\n- Recurring Role of Agreement Coordinator (previously known as Communications Coordinator)\n- Recurring Role of DAO Documentarian\n- Recurring Role of Dream Journal Writer\n- Recurring Role of Learning Together Coordinator\n- Recurring Role of Onboarding Coordinator\n- Recurring Role of POAP Wizard\n\nThe recurring roles of Twitter Guardian and Merit System Coordinator are not being considered in this update as they were created in the last months of Season 2 and the purpose of this proposal is to compensate the roles that started at the beginning of Season 2 (some roles even existed in Season 1 such as POAP Wizard, Journal Write, etc.).\n\nThe responsibilities of the recurring roles are maintained as before, making this compensation for the hard work, experience and perseverance in each of them.\n\nüóìÔ∏è**Duration:**\n- Start: Starting Season 3\n\nüí∞**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**\n- $20/hour for S2 recurring role as mentioned above.",

      "title": "DREAM DAO PROPOSAL #65: Madison Temporary Transition Role",
      "content": "üéØ**Goals:**\n1. To extend Madison‚Äôs role for 1.5 months.\n\nüèãÔ∏è**Point of Contact:**\n> Madison#9398 & **PlantBoi#9075**\n\nüí°**Description:**\n\n#### Why would this role be valuable?\n\nAs we begin Season 3 with new leadership, there are lots of transitions for the DAO to adjust to. In order to make this transition as successful as possible, it has been advised to Madison that she retain her role during the transition period to support the new leadership structure. Madison was officially no longer employed by Civics Unplugged/Dream DAO on January 1st. However last week, she realized there were will some responsibilities that she could not transfer over yet. \n\nLast week, she met with Celo/worked on the grant, accepted new Builders, and began to onboard the new Co-Stewards. This week, she will need to continue to work on the Celo grant and onboard the new Co-Stewards, along with doing some final work on the Explorers Program. \n\nAlongside this, it would be good for Madison to dedicate time over the next month to help Co-Stewards get settled in their new positions. This might include passing over important information regarding responsibilities to be carried out by Co-stewards as the CW steps down; establishing connections between Co-stewards and key people outside of the DAO (CU members, Funders etc); helping advise the Co-Stewards/WG leads on initial decisions, and helping them welcome the new builders. \n\n#### Additional Considerations\n\nThis month is the beginning of a new leadership structure and will serve as a test to determine if the Co-Stewards will need additional help from a Coordination Wizard role like the one Arath proposed. A CW-assisted transition period seems necessary to allow the Co-stewards and WG leads to receiving the knowledge to get set up to test this new system properly. After this month, if the Co-Stewards still need help, we can determine the areas that need supporting and run an election for an appropriately matched Coordination Wizard role. \n\n#### Scope\n\nHere is the proposed scope of the role: \n\n- **Timeline**: January 16th - February 16th (Because that is the earliest the proposal could be passed)\n- **Hours**: 8-10 per week\n- **Compensation**: $1,500 total (Hard to estimate, but this should cover the retroactive from early January and working 8-10 hours per week into February, so basically the salary for a month and a half)\n\nüíö**Benefits:**\n- This will be beneficial for DAO in the leadership transition phase.\n\nüóìÔ∏è**Duration:**\n- Start: January 16th\n- End: February 16th\n\nüí∞**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**\n- $1500",

      "content": "üéØGoals:\n- Defining the structure of Working Groups in Season 3.\n\nüèãÔ∏è**Point of Contact:**\n> Madison#9398\n\n### üí°Description:\nAs our DAO continues to evolve, so will our working groups! Working groups improved a lot from Season 1 to Season 2, and we want them to continue to improve into Season 3. We have learned a lot about how to set up working groups for success, and this proposal reflects those learnings.  \n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\n- Workings groups operate best when creating things/ideating, not fulfilling recurring tasks that could be done better by an individual (which is why we have recurring roles)\n- Working groups operate best when they have a very clear focus- not a broad one where they could be doing many things. When there are too many things a working group could be doing, it can be easy to get distracted. It is better to focus working groups on a specific topic/set of responsibilities so that they know what their priorities are.\n\n#### Proposed New Working Groups\n*Governance Working Group*\n- This would remain the same, there is a very clear set of responsibilities and solid structure for the group. \n\n*Grants Working Group*\n- This is an evolution of the partnerships working group. I think naming it the grants working group gives it a very specific focus instead of too broad ‚Äúpartnerships‚Äù. The key results can be very focused- like apply to 10 grants throughout the season and secure $30,000 in funding. People can divide into groups to write and help refine grants. This will also include getting creative- like finding people at the grant-giving organizations to reach out to and chat with. \n\n*Gatherings Working Group*\n- This is a combination of the gatherings and community building working group.  This working group can be responsible for both online and IRL events. There will be 2 primary responsibilities: \nCommunity hangouts: Community events (maybe twice per month) \nHigh level event planning: Like choosing which conferences we attend. The specifics will be carried out by co-stewards\n\n#### Proposed New Accountability Structure\n- Working groups must meet at least 2 times per month\n- Every month working group contributors are invited to submit a form providing feedback on the working group\n    - Co-Stewards will write ‚ÄúScorecards‚Äù each month that integrates the members‚Äô feedback and their observations\n- Halfway through the season, the Co-stewards will conduct a performance review of WG leads with a 1:1 call\n- A bi-weekly summary of all the working groups will be shared DAO-wide via Dream Journal.\n\nüóìÔ∏è**Duration:**\n- Start: Season 3\n\nüí∞**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**\n- none",

Dariel has a lot of valuable experience with the travel booking process and may work faster at booking trips than others, but that also means he may be compensated less for the same work someone else may complete. The base stipend guarantees fair compensation and the hourly pay allows for advanced situations to be compensated accordingly.\n- **Responsible for:**\n      - the background checks of adult chaperones on all trips (and submitting updated background checks for returning chaperones)\n       - maintaining a database of checked adults for Gatherings WG to identify vetted chaperones, and allowing folks to check on the currency of their background check\n        - verifying that every member has the proper documentation needed to travel in accordance with the destination regulations (such as passport, IDs, and vaccination status)\n        - booking travel itineraries and lodging on behalf of Dream DAO Builders who cannot be reimbursed for expenses\n        - purchasing tickets or coordinating the transfer of tickets on behalf of trip attended and the Dream DAO\n        - preparation of Civics Unplugged legal documents for builders to sign such as permission slips and liability/photography waivers\n        - and any other duties prescribed by the Co-Stewards and Gatherings WG.\n    - Dariel Cruz Rodriguez (*darielc.eth*) will serve in this role, as he has been maintaining these responsibilities recently for the Goa and ETH Mexico trips (specifically background checking chaperones and booking accommodations.) In the event the role becomes vacant, the co-stewards shall assume responsibilities until a new person is selected by the community.\n- This proposal establishes the process for Background Checking chaperones in accordance with the Chaperone Guidelines\n    - The Dream DAO will use the services of [Checkr](https://checkr.com/), which Civics Unplugged has agreed to pay for under their umbrella of programs.\n    - All chaperones must supply their legal name, place of residence, and email to the Travel Logistics Lead within 72 hours of being identified as a chaperone for any Dream DAO-sponsored or related trip.\n    - The chaperones will receive an email to which they must fill out sensitive information that will aid *Checkr* in clearing them to chaperone. This data is private and encrypted by bank-level technologies that cannot be accessed by DAO or Civics Unplugged staff. We can only see if they‚Äôve been cleared or not.\n        - Example of a **cleared report**\n        \n        [criminal_1657658765.pdf](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/e22e7da6-d0b2-4390-ab23-faf011ba2636/criminal_1657658765.pdf)\n        \n        - Example of a **denied report**\n        \n        [criminal_1657658771.pdf](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/7471ba66-9279-4b90-b0f7-cf19c0ba007b/criminal_1657658771.pdf)\n        \n    - Cleared reports are valid on a trip basis, for every trip a new background check must be done. If there are multiple trips within a three-month span, the check will be valid for all trips in the three-month span, starting with the first trip.\n- This proposal establishes the booking process preferences for Dream DAO\n    - Dream DAO Builders are preferred to book their trip itineraries on their own and get reimbursed by the DAO.\n        - If a builder cannot afford to be reimbursed or cannot for any reason participate in this process, the Travel Logistics Lead will meet with them to organize an alternative process.\n    - Champions must book their own travel itineraries and are preferred to book the lodging for the trip if they are able to.\n        - If a chaperone/champion cannot afford to be reimbursed or cannot for any reason participate in this process, the Travel Logistics Lead will meet with them to organize an alternative process.\n    \n\nüíö**Benefits:**\n- This process clears up any unknown/grey area with travel expenses and itineraries, which is important when working with minors and our parental partners.\n- Consolidating the background check process with one trusted member of the C.U. Team allows for discrete resolution of any disparages in the background check process.\n- The position allows one point of contact for trip accommodations, which is not only important to the businesses we book with but also for the participants who experience trouble traveling.\n- This proposal compensates Dariel for the valuable work he has already been doing.\n    - Dariel has saved Dream DAO $564 USD already between two quality bookings on the Goa, India trip. Quality bookings mean the flights still include bags and are insured.\n- This position allows the Gatherings WG to prioritize planning valuable and enriching events for our Builders and Champions rather than focusing on logistical questions.\n- This does NOT replace the Gatherings WG Lead, this role is merely a support role to book and organize on the plans of the Gathering WG.\n\nüìà**Success Metrics:**\n1. Travel accommodations are booked in a timely manner (within 1 week of request, preferably within 3 days)\n2. Travel accommodations are lined up with the vision the Gatherings WG has planned out for trips, including timing arrival and departure times together and taking into account schedules/agendas put together by the Gatherings WG.\n3. All chaperones are accounted for and background checked.\n4. Dream DAO saves money on flight bookings through a variety of means.\n\nüóìÔ∏è**Duration:**\n- Start: 07/18/2022\n- End: End of season 2 (which can be renewed)\n\nüí∞**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**\n- From the description: Hourly position of $17 USD/hour, OR a base stipend of $50 USD per trip coordinated (whichever is greater)\n    - Awarded in the equivalent value in USDC (or alternative, but equivalent in value cryptocurrency)\n\nüí∏**Token Distribution: (Sponsors‚Äô control)**\n- darielc.eth\n\nLEARN MORE: https://www.notion.so/cucrew/DREAM-DAO-PROPOSAL-51-Travel-Logistics-b5a2e2f7925344d7995ef466f39c9539",

Some of these partnerships may involve securing funding.\n    - It‚Äôs very important that partnerships are run through the community, because they can affect everything about how a DAO operates. Even a funder that wants to give Dream DAO a check with no strings attached comes with a brand that could negatively affect the brand of Dream DAO.\n    - Additionally, with the establishment of the Partnerships WG is to wind down the Fundraising WG, which we‚Äôve realized does not need a working group (yet). 90% of fundraising is covered by NFT sales and the cofounders of Dream DAO (Josh, Thanasi, and Gary).\n- On the process for engaging and potentially securing a new Dream DAO partner\n    - Member engages with potential organization to discuss potential partnership and terms\n    - Member brings partnership idea back to the DAO into the #partnerships-wg chat on our Dream DAO Discord\n    - Coming out of the forum if it is approved, member creates a proposal with details around:\n        - The potential partner and their mission\n        - The intersection with DreamDAO\n        - What the partnership will entail (what does DreamDAO give / receive and vice versa)\n        - If there is any funding or commitment required\n    - Proposal shall be voted on and approved by voting members of the DreamDAO\n    - If successful, communication will be coordinated and partnership will commence\n\nüíöBenefits:\n\n- Gets DAO approval before partnering with other DAOs and organizations\n- Allows for the assessment of risks and due diligence of partnering with other organizations and can help to protect DreamDAO‚Äôs reputation\n- Allows for the DAO to understand the potential benefits to the DAO if the partnership is made and any potential use of treasury funds before going to approval\n\nüìàSuccess Metrics:\n\n1.

The program is designed to allow learners to take the often-abstract concepts behind NFTs, DAOs, and social tokens, and apply them in a project/product development framework. \n\nTheir next program is slated to start on May 2, 2022, and will include options for:\n\n- 1-track program that includes just the course curriculum\n- 2-track program that includes courses + a project component\n\nIn exchange for the scholarships, Cypto College has asked if they can include us in their promotional materials and potentially have cross-promotion through hosting Twitter Spaces together, including in each other‚Äôs newsletters etc. Promotions may also include highlighting our members as part of their alumni network. \n\nüíö**Benefits:** \n\n- Keen and motivated Builders will have access to another path for learning how to use web3 tools in ways that shift for-profit endeavors to align with the goals of public good.\n- Experience working with web2 product development/management natives in transition from web2-web3.\n- Builders who don‚Äôt participate in the Explorers program can benefit from this accelerated program to put some of their Dream DAO learning into practice.\n- Increased exposure for Dream DAO, could potentially bring new Champions/Friends to the DAO\n\nüóìÔ∏è**Duration:** \n\nOngoing partnership, unless terminated by either organization through a subsequent community vote. Voting period is 5 days.\n\nüí∞**Tokens/ETH Requested: (Treasury control)**\n\nNone\n\nü§®**RISKS: **\n\n- Crypto College operates within the corporate sector; poor framing of partnership may risk appearing as if we are not maintaining integrity to our social impact cause\n- The partnership could end up being tokenistic - creating more positive publicity for Crypto College while not actually empowering diverse voices in their program",
