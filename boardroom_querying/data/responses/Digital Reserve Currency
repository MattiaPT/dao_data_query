With that being said this Polygon(matic) liquidity proposal makes the most sense to solve this underlying problem.\n\nAs of 12/11/2021 the active address count on the polygon network was a staggering number of 388k (as high as 550k in recent months) to couple with 288k Ethereum addresses that interact with the polygon network, It's plain to see that this network is utilized daily by many people across the globe that trade with extremely low fees( pennies on the dollar). The polygon(matic) network has shown stability throughout inception and future innovation by being one of the heaviest researchers/investors in the new scaling solution of zero-knowledge proofs(zk).\n\nBy adding these funds to the network, it helps us with.\n1: Provides more accessibility for the masses to obtain DRC\n2: Allows for affordable and seamless trades in and out of DRC\n3: Makes marketing to new investors very easy by notice of our trading volume\n4: Utilizes our fund money by putting it to work rather than just sitting stagnant. \n\nGet active and vote yes\n\nDRC for the win $!!$!$!$!$",

      "title": "DRC Foundation Grant Proposal #001",
      "content": "Tl;dr:\n\na) The DRC Foundation wishes to provide a $3000 grant to Emmanuel Okwori, a DRC community member, to assist in the purchase of a printing press premises in his local area of Benue State in Nigeria. \n\nb) The remaining $3000 ($6000 total) will be opened towards the DRC community to donate towards. All contributions of $500 or more to the Foundation Fund, in the form of USDC, ETH or DRC, will be rewarded with a GEN01 NFT.\n\n-----\nProposal\n\nA digital printing company in Benue State, Nigeria, is looking to auction off the company, rights to its premises and the associated printing equipment.\n\nThe total cost of this opportunity is $6000. The DRC Foundation proposes a grant of $3000 to be transferred in WETH from the DRC Foundation Fund to Mr. Okwori’s personal Ethereum address, where he can then withdraw and utilise the funds for the above opportunity.\n\nThe DRC Foundation will also encourage community members to donate to fulfill the full $6000 requirement; an additional $3000 target for donations will be set. Community members that donate a minimum of $500, in the form of USDC, ETH or DRC to the DRC Foundation Fund will also receive a GEN01 NFT.\n\n-----\nRationale\n\nMr Okwori is a long-time supporter of DRC through his role as lead admin in the DRC Africa community. Thanks to his regular and positive contributions to the community space, and his on-the-ground efforts for DRC, including holding digital asset seminars in his local area and creating DRC-themed t-shirts and graphics, Mr. Okwori has shown himself to be one of DRC’s most trusted contributors.\n\nAs Mr. Okwori’s profession is within the digital media space, this opportunity aligns well to his skills and connections. He can use the facilities to contribute to the outreach campaign in Nigeria and Africa proper.\n\nThe DRC Foundation would like to extend this offer to Mr. Okwori based on the quality of the business opportunity, and the offer is bolstered by the understanding of Mr. Okwori’s character and desire to progress DRC in his region of Nigeria. A grant such as this is not an investment in a business, but in a staunch believer and humble supporter of DRC.\n\nThe opportunity also allows the DRC community to demonstrate its ethos of a project built by the community, for the community.\n\nThis proposal will be voted on by the DRC community via a Snapshot governance vote. If passed, the DRC Foundation Fund will begin the transfer to Mr. Okwori. Mr. Okwori will commit to regular updates of both his involvement in the business, his efforts to utilise the printing business for the benefit of DRC, and also the financial performance of the printing business.\n\n----- \nBelow is a link to a .pdf file that contains the full proposal from the DRC Foundation, Mr. Okwori's original proposal, a breakdown of the costing and equipment, and a series of photographs of the premises. \n\nhttps://bafybeidgu2cbgco3nd5t2bam7qr5b7l6itmf2wzu3he75njuaz3nid4djy.ipfs.dweb.link/\n-----",

      "content": "Proposal\n\nThe following steps to be carried out by the DRC Foundation:\n1) To remove the s1 and s3 Vault Sets from use.\n    a) Disable future deposits\n    b) Move to an ‘archive’ section\n    c) Eventually remove completely from the site\n\n2) To update the s2 Vault\n    a) Rename to s1\n    b) Change the weighting to 90% USDC, 5% ETH and 5%BTC\n\n3a) Provide ongoing external and community driven incentives to depositors to the DRC Vault:\n    a) Weekly distribution to 1 random address: 50,000 DRC\n    b) Monthly distribution to 1 random address: 250,000 DRC\n    c) Quarterly distribution to 1 random address: 500,000 DRC\n    d) NFT Drops (i.e. Hashmasks, Spunks, AI Art, Wicked Craniums and more)\n    e) Provide the ERC-20 addresses of DRC Vault users to other DRC community members that want to distribute rewards\n\n3b) Dependent on the following criteria:\n    a) The wallet address must have an active deposit in the DRC Vault\n    b) At least 50,000 DRC must be deposited to qualify for the Weekly and Monthly DRC Rewards\n    c) At least 1,000,000 DRC must be deposited to qualify for the Quarterly DRC Rewards\n    d) At least 100,000 DRC must be deposited to qualify for the NFT Rewards\n    e) The deposit for monthly rewards must be for at least 30 days uninterrupted\n    f) The deposit for quarterly rewards must be for at least 3months uninterrupted\n\nRationale\n\nThe reasons for the above proposal are as follows:\n1) The s1 and s3 Vaults are routed through Uniswap v2 liquidity and during the period of v2 and v3 migration, it is uncertain whether projects will remain on v2 or move. If they move then the Vaults may experience liquidity issues. Further, there are unclear regulatory guidelines for DeFi investment protocols at present and this may present a challenge for DRC’s compliance.\n\n2) The s2 Vault contains highly liquid assets only and is a hedging allocation set, not an investment proposal. The additions of BTC and ETH are to help offset inflationary forces. The s2 Vault provdes great utility for DRC users that may want to hedge the market conditions.\n\n3a) The DRC Vault is solely a visible storage Vault, and alone produces no rewards for holders. The initiative proposed both rewards the DRC supporters and also drives forward the community structure that is the focus for this quarter.\n\n3b) These criteria are proposed to drive value into the DRC market and to ensure that only committed holders are eligible for rewards.",

      "content": "As many of you may be aware, Uniswap V3 has recently launched and liquidity provisioning for all projects, including DRC, is still in motion.\n\nThe DRC Foundation believes Uniswap V2 is here to stay for the mid to long term for some big pairs, such as BTC/ETH, ETH/WETH and USDC/ETH, yet PAXG/ETH is a smaller pool with less certainty.\n\nPAXG is one token that DR Vault s1 and DR Vault s2 currently utilises, there remains uncertainty around its mid to long term availability on Uniswap V2.\n\nAs a step towards risk mitigation, we propose performing an Emergency Strategy Update (ESU) to the DR Vault s1 and s2 portfolio allocations, to replace PAXG with other suitable assets.\n\nOur proposal is as follows:\n\nDR Vault s1:\n\n40% BTC, 40% ETH, and 20% DRC.\n\nDR Vault s2:\n\n90% USDC, 5% BTC, and 5% ETH.\n\n———\n\nPlease note:\nAny patrons with their capital in DR Vault s1 and DR Vault s2 are not at risk of any loss during this ESU. This ESU will only replace PAXG with the proposed assets and perform a rebalancing of the percentages.\n\nUpon a successful vote for this proposal, the ESU will commence shortly after a period of time for any patrons to withdrawal if they so wish.\n\nThe following steps would occur:\n\n1. Allow existing patrons of s1 and s2 DR Vaults to withdraw within 24 hours, if they want to.\n\n2. Pause the DR Vault interface for DR Vaults s1 and s2 while the new token allocations are performed.\n\n3. Work on the backend of the data analytics of the DR Vaults and update the interface with the new token allocations.\n\n4. Unpause the DR interface and resume the DR Vaults s1 and s2.",

      "content": "\nThe DRC Genesis LP, created by Maxim when he released 100% of the DRC token supply onto Uniswap, along with 3ETH, has been unlocked from Unicrypt. We must now decide how to best utilise these funds.\n\nAs per the Liquidity Provision Incentive released in November, those that have been providing liquidity for DRC-ETH on Uniswap will receive their pro-rata share of the accumulated fees since the time of Genesis.\n\nThe next steps are more open for the DRC Community.\n\nConsiderations:\n- The LP unlock is currently ~$800k \n- The DR Vaults require strong liquidity pools to function correctly\n- Uniswap is still the most popular AMM in the market\n- Potential uses for the funds\n- Uniswap v3 is around the corner.\n\nThe Proposal\n- Redistribute the accumulated fees according to the Liquidity Provision Incentive program\n- Provide ~$150k to Quickswap in the form of a DRC/MATIC pool \n[Currently, there are some pools on Quickswap but are extremely shallow. If we are to create this pool, we can also benefit from synergistic marketing with Quickswap’s team]\n- The remaining Genesis LP is transferred to the DRC Foundation Multisig wallet\n- Relock the remaining funds for 1 month to allow for the release of Uniswap v3, and reassess the best options forward for DRC after this.\n\nCaveats:\n- For the Quickswap Liquidity transfer, there is no viable technical solution to do this without a person manually transferring. The Foundation proposes the Josh (CC) can set up a live stream of the transfer. The process would be to receive the allocated funds (ETH and DRC), bridge to Polygon via the Matic Bridge, trade the ETH for MATIC, and create the genesis pool for DRC/MATIC. Currently there is no Gnosis safe available on Polygon, but it is in the works. Until that point, the LP will remain in the wallet featured in the live stream.\n- The LP fees redistribution will be in the form of the Uni v2 DRC/ETH LP token, transferred to the qualifying 52 addresses that have provided liquidity until this point. The transfer will be performed by the DR Vaults Developer Wallet.\n\nNotes: \n- For the health of the ecosystem, it is extremely important that DRC community members continue to provide liqudity on Uniswap, and increase their LP holdings if possible.\n- Those on Quickswap already providing liquidity please continue to do so until the DRC/MATIC pool is released.",

      "title": "Digital Reserve Vaults",
      "content": "Proposal: \nBuilding and releasing the Digital Reserve, an on-chain vault platform into which DRC holders may deposit their DRC to gain automatic and secure exposure to a selection of assets. \n\nIn the case of Digital Reserve Currency and in keeping with the ethos of storing value, the proposal initially suggests an allocation of assets that are traditionally considered stores of value. These include but are not limited to: Bitcoin (BTC), Tokenised Dollar (USDC), Tokenised Gold (PAXG) and Etheruem (ETH).\n\nThe Digital Reserve is to be developed by trusted community members and funded using Ethereum from the Foundation Fund. The developers are to follow strict guidelines regarding security of the platform and the build must then pass a rigorous audit before being released onto mainnet.\n\nThe vaults are to be built with a rebalancing strategy embedded, which allows for the basket's allocations to remain constant despite potential market changes. The control of these strategy changes is to be linked with the DRC Foundation Fund multi-signature Gnosis wallet and thus controlled by the democratically elected DRC Representatives.\n\nRationale: \nTo build additional utility into the DRC ecosystem and further integrate DRC into the DeFi and blockchain space. \n\nNotes: \nFuture allocations of the Digital Reserve baskets are to be decided by the community via snapshot proposal. This proposal includes two vaults upon launch: BTC / PAXG / ETH and USDC / BTC / PAXG.",
