      "title": "Stargate Deployment to Unichain",
      "content": "Summary\n\nUniswap recently announced Unichain, an L2 designed for DeFi.\n\nThis proposal outlines a request for the DAO to approve a deployment of Stargate with an ETH and USDC pool on the Uniswap chain. This deployment should be incentivised by STG as/when needed according to SIP #23. It is also requested that the DAO provides $3m in initial liquidity from the Stargate V1 pool on Arbitrum, and $3m of initial USDC liquidity from the Stargate V1 pool on Ethereum (or whichever makes most sense).\n\nMotivation\n\nUniswap is one of the most successful DeFi protocols in the space, doing over $1b in volume a day with over $4.8b in TVL. Alongside its success financially, it has proven to be a brand with staying power and the Uniswap DAO continues to innovate. We expect that their new chain will exceed expectations and prove to be just as successful as their DEX, and therefore, Stargate should dominate bridging into the chain.\n\nUniswap’s new chain is built on the OP stack and is part of the Superchain. Stargate has a very strong relationship with Optimism, and during the Superfest Stargate dominated inflows with $194m of volume and over 250,000 transactions. This accounted for 58% of all bridging activity in and out of the Superchain during the campaign. Following this, we believe it is of high value for Stargate to continue to dominate bridging within the Superchain and maintain an important relationship with the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nIt is of strategic importance that Stargate is early to ecosystems such as this given their growth potential and the high demand for blockspace that will likely exist. When Stargate is early it beats the competition and often becomes the de facto bridge for any chain that integrates.\n\nProposal\n\nIt is proposed that Stargate deploys on the Uniswap chain and deploys an ETH and a USDC pool. The Stargate DAO should provide an initial $6m in total liquidity which should be diverted from the Stargate V1 pools on Arbitrum and Ethereum. Furthermore, this deployment should be incentivised by STG as/when needed according to SIP #23.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis proposal aims to build on Stargate’s success in the Superchain and deploy on a chain with a top tier team that is likely to create a lot of excitement and usage. We expect Stargate will dominate on the Uniswap chain if this proposal passes.",

      "title": "Integrate with LightLink Network",
      "content": "The LightLink Foundation proposes a strategic partnership between LightLink, the gasless blockchain network, and Stargate v2, aiming to enhance cross-chain functionality and DeFi solutions within the blockchain ecosystem. The integration involves launching Stargate v2 on LightLink, supported by liquidity and incentive programs, including a 4,000,000 LL token allocation and a marketing campaign to boost visibility and adoption. The partnership promises to strengthen both platforms’ positions in the DeFi market by increasing cross-chain liquidity, transaction volume, and ecosystem growth, inviting Stargate DAO members to approve the initiative for future growth and innovation.\n\nBackground:\n\nLightLink is an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain that lets dApps and enterprises offer users instant, gasless transactions. As the first L2 to leverage Optimium architecture with a proprietary stack, LightLink aims to support 10,000+ TPS at under $0.01, without gas spikes.\n\nLightLink’s novel Enterprise Mode enables businesses to operate gas-free, allowing users on their platforms to engage in a secure, user-friendly blockchain network without transaction fees, barriers to entry, or the need for any tokens. LightLink already powers over 30 partnerships, including Animoca Brands, and is being integrated in Translucia, a US$300 million venture by T&B Media Global.\n\nAdditionally, LightLink has built a community of over 200,000 members and achieved more than 100,000 daily transactions since the Mainnet launch in October 2023.\n\nOpportunity:\n\nThe integration with Stargate v2 offers a unique opportunity to leverage LightLink’s technological leadership and massive user base. LightLink will introduce Hydra assets USDC and USDT in order to bring stablecoin availability cross-chain; we anticipate that these assets will be the de facto variants of USDC and USDT utilized throughout our ecosystem.\n\nStargate’s advanced bridging solutions, combined with LightLink’s liquidity and EVM-equivalent DeFi and GameFi opportunities as well as access to Enterprise Mode clients, can significantly enhance cross-chain functionality across the blockchain ecosystem.\n\nProposal Details:\n\nIntegration: Launch of Stargate v2 on LightLink Chain as a launch partner with immediate liquidity and incentive availability for ETH.\n\nLiquidity Support: LightLink is able to supply 100 ETH of LightLink Foundation supplied liquidity\n\nIncentive Program:\n- LightLink is willing to provide 4,000,000 LL tokens as incentives for liquidity provisioning.\n- Stargate to provide roughly equivalent value of STG tokens as backup LP incentives, specifically 250,000 STG tokens.\n- In case LL token incentives are depleted we can then fall back on STG tokens to be used as incentives. If this were to arise then Stargate to discuss with LightLink the possibility of providing additional LL tokens for LP incentives.\n- In the case both STG & LL token incentives are depleted then Stargate can wind down LightLink ETH LP incentive, to continue supporting LightLink ETH bridging with additional STG incentives Stargate DAO may conduct another vote.\n\nAs for end users who will be bridging to and from LL, they are able to participate in the LightLink Community Rewards campaign, as well as access to the Proof of Liquidity campaign being run on LightLink’s DeFi applications will grant access to the Node Validator NFT program later in the year.\n\nMarketing Campaign: An extensive campaign to highlight Stargate v2’s integration with LightLink, emphasizing the benefits of enhanced cross chain and interconnectivity capabilities. This campaign aims to bolster both platforms’ visibility and adoption in the broader blockchain ecosystem.\n\nBenefits:\n\nThis strategic partnership promises to deliver benefits including:\n\n- Enhanced cross-chain liquidity and asset bridging capabilities.\n- Increased transaction volume and ecosystem growth for both Stargate and LightLink.\n- Strengthened position in the DeFi market through innovative EVM Layer 2 DeFi solutions.\n- Expansive marketing and community engagement efforts, promoting wider adoption and recognition.\n\nExecution & Timeline:\n\n- Immediate Steps: Formal approval of the proposal by respective DAOs.\n- Liquidity Pool Launch: Coordinated launch upon proposal acceptance, with detailed timelines to be announced.\n- Marketing Campaign Rollout: Commencing immediately post-approval to maximize exposure and user engagement.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis proposal represents a strategic initiative to harness the strengths of both Stargate and LightLink Chain, facilitating a leap forward in the interoperability and functionality of DeFi. Stargate DAO members are invited to endorse this partnership, unlocking new dimensions of growth and innovation.\n\nParticipation:\n\nAll DAO members are encouraged to actively participate in this pivotal decision, ensuring collaborative efforts reflect the community’s vision and ambition.",

      "content": "Summary\n\nIt is proposed that Stargate launches an ETH pool and USDC pool on Soneium Network. Stargate should use some of its existing POL within Stargate V1 pools to seed the new pools on Soneium. In total, it is requested that $2m is moved from Stargate V1 on Polygon, and the ETH from Mainnet - with $2m coming from the USDC pool and the other $3m coming from the mainnet ETH pool.\n\nMotivation\n\nSoneium Network is a collaboration between Sony and Startale Labs with the aim of being a global infrastructure that underpins the Web3 era, driving innovation across existing industries. The network will benefit from Sonys’ experience in communication, IoT, AI and solution services and is expected to have an extensive ecosystem at launch with plenty of support to grow. \n\nSony is a clear powerhouse of a brand that we believe should be associated with Stargates’ growing presence as the best bridge in the web3 ecosystem. Similarly, given Startale Labs’ expertise in the web3 space we are excited to see where any technical partnership with Stargate and Startale x Sony could end up.\n\nIt is of strategic importance that Stargate is early to ecosystems such as this given their growth potential and the high demand for blockspace that will likely exist. When Stargate is early it beats the competition and often becomes the de facto bridge for any chain that integrates. \n\nBy enabling ETH and USDC bridging for Soneium Network at launch Stargate aims to become the primary liquidity transfer destination for all users looking to move in and out of the network at speed and low cost.\n\nProposal\n\nIt is proposed that Stargate launches an ETH and a USDC pool on Soneium Network to take advantage of a high potential ecosystem and grow our dominance in the bridging sphere.\n\nFurthermore, it is proposed that the DAO provides $5m of POL to the Startale Network pools which could eventually be removed given there is enough usage and supply into the pools. This POL should come from Stargate V1 on Polygon where there is minimal usage of the pool and also a desire to slowly push migration to V2 pools. \n\nOf this $5 million: $2m should be from the USDC in the existing V1 pool on Polygon $3m should be from the ETH in the existing V1 pool on Ethereum\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this proposal aims to place Stargate strategically in an ecosystem with high potential as early as possible which in turn should position Stargate incredibly well to be the primary venue for bridging.",

      "content": "Introduction \nThis proposal seeks approval from the Stargate DAO to establish a USDC pool on the BNB Chain. \n\nMotivation \nBNB Chain has historically been an important partner for the Stargate DAO. Stargate has helped to enable the success of BNB Chain by making it simple and cheap for users to bridge in and out of the ecosystem. Meanwhile, the huge demand for BNB Chain has created a lot of usage for Stargate.This partnership has significantly contributed to the success of both Stargate and BNB Chain, which remains one of the most popular ecosystems within Stargate’s network.\n\nTo strengthen this symbiotic relationship, we propose introducing a dedicated USDC pool on the BNB Chain. Ensuring the availability of USDC on BNB Chain through Stargate will capitalize on the high demand for USDC in the ecosystem and position Stargate as a major player in meeting that demand.\n\nProposal\nCreation of a USDC Pool on BNB Chain: Establish a USDC liquidity pool on BNB Chain, facilitating efficient transfer of USDC between Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and BNB Chain.\n\nLiquidity Support: The BNB Chain team has committed to providing initial liquidity to the newly created USDC pool. Any subsequent liquidity should be incentivised according to SIP#23. \n\nConclusion Approval of this proposal will establish a USDC pool on the BNB Chain.",

      "title": "Integrate with Sei Network",
      "content": "Background\nThis governance proposal outlines the integration of Sei Network, a Layer 1 blockchain, with Stargate, a cross-chain and interconnectivity protocol powered by Layer Zero. Sei is a general purpose, open-source Layer 1 blockchain that aims to provide a unique scaling solution to grow the Ethereum Ecosystem alongside other ETH Layer 2 solutions. Sei launched V1 mainnet in August 2023 with full Cosmwasm interoperability and consistently performs at 400ms time-to-finality. Currently, Sei is preparing for V2 mainnet in H1, 2024 which will enable EVM compatibility on the blockchain and even faster performance speeds.\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to:\n1. Improve user bridging experience on/off Sei for both Stargate and Sei users;\n2. Enable Sei to be infrastructurally connected to and share liquidity with other LayerZero supported blockchains and;\n3. Unlock interchain liquidity for both Stargate and Sei users via a Stargate Deployment on Sei Network\n\nAbout Sei\nScheduled to be the first highly performant parallelized EVM in production, Sei’s consensus mechanism and client have undergone extensive battle-testing. With ruthless prioritization on speed and performance, Sei currently boasts the fastest time to finality of any decentralized network in the blockchain industry, achieving a speed of 390ms on its current V1 mainnet.\n\nSei V2 is on target to launch in H1 2024, which will further enhance the speed of Sei via a number of improvements, such as Optimistic Parallelization and Sei DB. The Sei Foundation is also preparing several campaigns and initiatives aimed at supporting new applications launching for Sei V2 mainnet.\n\nOn V2 mainnet, developers can leverage all the same applications and tools as on existing EVM chains, without any changes required. This unlocks an entirely new design space for developers in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nReasons for integration\nHow Sei benefits:\nUnlock access to a Cross-Chain Ecosystem: Sei will gain access to Stargate’s interconnected ecosystem, enabling better collaboration with other blockchain networks, projects, and DApps.\n\nSeamless Cross-Chain Transactions: Sei users will be able to safely conduct cross- chain transactions with ease, enabling an interconnected and user-friendly blockchain experience.\n\nEnhanced Liquidity: This integration will serve to open up opportunities for Sei’s DeFi ecosystem by attracting liquidity providers, traders and users from the broader Stargate ecosystem.\n\nHow Stargate benefits:\nPotential Protocol Leader: By being an early part of Sei’s EVM Compatible V2 mainnet, Stargate will position itself as the premier EVM bridge for the native assets requested for in this Proposal (USDT and USDC), and stands to benefit from core bridging volume from Day 1.\n\nAlignment with Vision: This integration demonstrates Stargate’s ability and commitment towards providing support to EVM compatible chains, and builds on its vision to become the transport protocol at the heart of omnichain DeFi.\n\nIncrease User Base: This integration will onboard Sei’s users, developers and projects onto the Stargate ecosystem, further adding diversity to an already vibrant network.\n\nNetworking Effect: With more integrations with a multitude of chains, Stargate serves to benefit from strong network effect and an increased economic moat. This will help Stargate continue to attract and retain projects and developers seeking cross-chain interoperability.\n\nProposal\nWe propose for Stargate to deploy on the Sei Network as a Day 1 partner for V2 EVM compatible mainnet launch. A LayerZero Endpoint is in progress to be deployed in V2 testnet by Jan 2024, and subsequently V2 mainnet by H1, 2024.\n\nTo begin, The Sei Foundation proposes for the following Stargate pools/pathways to be enabled upon successful deployment:\n- USDT\n- USDC\n\nTo incentivize the launch, The Sei Foundation is committed to:\n1. A 1-year grant of $1m USD in SEI tokens distributed across 12 months from deployment ($500k to USDT pool + $500k to USDC pool respectively) and;\n2. A separate $40k USD in SEI tokens to be provided as gas fees reimbursement when users first bridge over to Sei Network.\n\nFurther to the above mentioned token grant, Sei Network contributors will also bootstrap liquidity by deploying $10m USD in liquidity across both USDC and USDT pools.\n\nBoth USDC and USDT on SEI are native through the cosmos ecosystem. Circle has announced that all USDC that is minted on the Noble chain will be considered native and Tether has announced that all USDT minted on Kava will be considered native.\n\nIn addition, The Sei Foundation will also commit to a comprehensive marketing campaign to ensure exponential traction of Stargate’s eventual and successful deployment on Sei V2 mainnet. The marketing campaign will also include educational components on bridging Native Assets, which aims to fuel awareness, adoption and user onboarding.\n\nExecution\nIf approved, Stargate will launch on Day 1 of Sei EVM Compatible V2 mainnet. USDT and USDC pools/pathways are to be enabled upon the successful deployment of Stargate on Sei.\n\nSummary\nSei Network is launching EVM compatible V2 mainnet in H1, 2024 and the aim is to invite Stargate to come on board as an early launch partner from Day 1.\n\nWe believe that a successful Stargate deployment on Sei Network will be a historic milestone that serves to achieve a win-win scenario for both Stargate users, who will benefit from additional access points for DAO revenue; as well as users of Sei Network, who will benefit from better omni chain infrastructure (i.e. Bridging to/from networks in the ETH ecosystem).\n\nThe Sei Foundation invites the Stargate community to unite in this endeavour and support this groundbreaking collaboration within the decentralized finance space. Collectively, we will push the boundaries towards a more interconnected ecosystem and decentralized blockchain future.",

      "title": "StargateDAO Governance Process",
      "content": "Summary If approved, this proposal would institute a new and improved governance process for the Stargate DAO.\n\nMotivation Since the inception of the Stargate DAO decentralized governance has played an integral role in the development of the protocol and its expansion throughout the cryptoverse. \n\nCurrently, the DAO operates through a combination of discord, commonwealth and Snapshot. Whilst this has been an effective set up we believe it is time for the Stargate DAO to undergo an upgrade.\n\nBy upgrading our governance process we will ensure that the DAO is more efficient in decision making, there is more room for community feedback and that teams looking to work with Stargate have a more clear path forward with structure when looking to work with the community.\n\nProposal\n\nOutlined below is our proposal for the new governance process, important governance thresholds and other relevant thoughts and ideas.\n\nRegular process\n\n- Formulate an idea for a proposal to the DAO.\n- Examples: New network integrations, service provider proposals, technical protocol changes, STG LP positions, etc.\n- Post your proposal in the Stargate forum on Discourse.\n- It is recommended to leave this proposal in the forum for at least 7 days.\n- After 7 days have passed you can update your proposal based on feedback provided in the forum or through other avenues.\n- Once your proposal is finalized it should be left in the forum for another 3 days for final comments.\n- After your feedback period is complete, and there is a positive consensus in the forum, it is time to create a vote on Snapshot.\n- To post a proposal on Snapshot one needs a minimum of 50,000 veSTG.\n- If you do not have this yourself, you should find someone who does and is willing to post for you.\n- Snapshot set up:\n- Set your vote to start 24 hours from when you upload the Snapshot.\n- This is to give time for people to prepare their voting wallets as well as give the community a final 24 hour window in case of any missed comments.\n- Minimum voting period of 3 days, however if you’d like longer to give people time to vote that is fine.\n- For your Snapshot to pass it must reach quorum, which is 1,500,000 veSTG.\n- If your vote fails, you must leave at least 2 weeks before you re-propose.\n- If your vote passes you can approach the Stargate Foundation to implement the governance approved changes.\n\nFast-track process If your proposal is urgent ie. relates to an important security upgrade for the protocol then you can follow this process instead of the regular process.\n\n- Post proposal in the DAO forum.\n- Your proposal can then go to a vote after a 12 hour period.\n- Post your Snapshot vote.\n- The voting period for a fast-track proposal is 12 hours.\n\nQuorum, threshold and snapshot length \n\n- Forum post feedback period: >= 5 days\n- Quorum: 1,500,000 (This quorum may be adjusted in the initial 90 days +/- 20% in order to find the right balance of participation).\n- Proposal threshold: 50,000\n- Snapshot length: >= 3 days\n- Voting differential: >= 70% votes FOR\n- Time before re-proposing in case of a failed Snapshot: >= 14 days\n\nOther All feedback under a proposal must be related to the proposal in question. Comments unrelated to the original post will be deleted by community moderators. \n\nProposers that do not follow the approved structure will have their posts locked or taken down depending on the infraction.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf approved, this proposal will indicate a new chapter for Stargate governance. With a more structured approach we expect governance to become more efficient and effective for all involved. This process will then be outlined in Stargate’s documentation to ensure clear guidance for all interested participants.",

The partnership started with the creation of liquidity paths for USDT transfers between Kava, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain, and Avalanche. Now we are ready for the next big milestone, of continuing to offer users new and exciting opportunities, and this time with Native WBTC.\n\nKava will be the 5th chain with native wBTC deployed! Note: wBTC is the first ERC20 token backed 1:1 with Bitcoin. Completely transparent. 100% verifiable. Community led. The Kava origin team would like to make bridging of wBTC more accessible to the broader community by enabling cross-chain transfers between Ethereum and Kava.\n\nProposal:- Create a new pool for wBTC on Kava and enable transfers between Kava and Ethereum.\n\nKava will provide an initial deposit of $1M in wBTC\nGuaranteed 100,000 KAVA over the next two years distributed monthly and in addition to Kava Rise which is an innovative and transparent on-chain incentive program for developers driving adoption to the Kava Network.\nTo incentivize wBTC and increase liquidity within the Kava Ecosystem. Kava and its native projects will provide ~$40,000 in rewards for wBTC on monthly across a variety of projects.\nBrief Summary: BitGo is deploying native $wBTC on Kava. The Kava Foundation is seeking for two Stagate pools to be deployed: $wBTC on Ethereum and Kava, to allow for bridging between these two chains. Kava will provide an initial deposit of $1M in wBTC, as well as a guaranteed 100,000 KAVA over the next two years distributed monthly.",

      "title": "Stargate Foundation RFP Proposal",
      "content": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Stargate Community has engaged in extensive discussions regarding the use of the potential LayerZero Token allocation received as a result of the LayerZero RFP Process. This proposal sets forth what we believe to be the best and highest use for those such allocations, considering the Communities objectives. It pertains to both the LayerZero Token allocation to the Stargate Protocol, and the AptosBridge.\n\nApproval of this proposal will result in a final and definitive mandate by the StargateDAO, superseding prior other proposals on the subject matter herein. Any subsequent proposals will complicate this process further, and may jeopardize the Stargate Foundations ability to collect the necessary data in time for the May 31, 2024 LayerZero RFP Deadline. Two snapshot proposals were posted but are not in the interest of the community as they seem designed to, in some way, direct the StargateDAO’s allocation to private holders and as such should be rejected.\n\nPROPOSAL GUIDELINES You are able to abstain from voting if you do not agree with a proposal, and do not want it to reach quorum.\n\nSTARGATE PROTOCOL PROPOSAL\n\nThe Stargate community has identified three groups of classes to which a LayerZero token allocation should be allocated: bridgers, LP providers, and STG stakers. The Proposal would distribute of the StargateDAO potential LayerZero Token rewards as follows to those groups as follows:\n\n60% allocated to bridgers 42% to users who have bridged, volume-weighted 18% reserved for partner protocols in nested RFP Process 20% allocated to veSTG holders 10% to LP providers 10% developer allocation as recommended by LayerZero\n\n60% – Bridgers Bridging volumes drives value and fees to the protocol/DAO. As such it is the primary performance metric of Stargate and thus the highest use of LayerZero Token allocation. The 60% portion will be allocated as 42% to users who have bridged, and 18% reserved for partner protocols who have composed Stargate (such as LiFi, WOOFi, etc.) for a nested RFP process.\n\nThe 42% allocation for bridging users will be volume-weighted. More specifically, users who bridged more volume will receive a larger allocation. All volume through Stargate will be considered from 17th March 2022 to 1st May 2024 (LayerZero’s Snapshot #1). It is worth noting that users who have bridged using Stargate (and therefore sent a LayerZero message) will likely also receive a separate allocation from LayerZero at TGE.\n\nThe 18% allocation reserved for partner protocols has two key points: Applications built on top of Stargate have driven roughly $2b of Stargate’s volume. They have been very aligned with Stargate and have done tremendous things for branding and awareness, as well as value to the protocol (fees). These protocols are NOT eligible for LayerZero’s Protocol RFP, since all of their volume is attributed to Stargate on LayerZero Scan. The process for distributing this allocation is that Stargate will reserve 18% for these protocols, who will work with the Stargate Foundation to collate the allocations and user addresses from all partner protocols, to LayerZero’s Commonwealth Forum - as a nested RFP. Further details regarding how the partner protocols should reward users is provided here. The deadline to work with the Foundation on this is 5th June 2024 (two days before LayerZero’s partner protocol RFP deadline). Protocols looking to participate in the nested RFP process will work with the Foundation to have their valid submissions added as a comment to Stargate’s original post.\n\n20% – veSTG holders STG holders who engage in voting escrows help secure the Stargate protocol and support its growth via governance and voting. As such, it is reasonable and appropriate that they receive a 20% portion of the StargateDAO’s LayerZero Token allocation.\n\nThis allocation will be time-weighted and volume-weighted, with a consideration for (amount locked * duration locked for), which will provide an accurate time-weighted score. Any users who re-locked, or added an additional amount of veSTG, will have this summed to their score. This ensures that users who staked a smaller amount but for a long time are rewarded, while users who stake large amounts for a short time are not overly-rewarded.\n\nThe Stargate Foundation is additionally recommending that the lower bound for inclusion is >20veSTG (~$10 for much of this period), at time of locking. The Foundation is presenting the following data to back up this recommendation, which has been collected from various Snapshot proposals. Votes if VP <= 0.1: 45701 (10.98%) (11% of wallets that voted have <0.1 veSTG) Votes if VP <= 5: 278366 (66.86%) Votes if VP <= 10: 297354 (71.42%) Votes if VP <= 20: 342996 (82.38%) (82% of wallets that voted have <20 veSTG)\n\nApplying a threshold of >20veSTG cuts out 82.3% of wallets that have voted on proposals for Stargate. This will significantly reduce the number of botter’s and sybils that would otherwise receive an allocation. While this may seem like a high number, it is important to note that the vast majority of these wallet addresses are generated by sybil clusters that are outside the scope of LayerZero’s sybil filtering process. This is because some veSTG holders only vote on Stargate proposals, and do not conduct LayerZero messages – therefore they will likely not be included in the LayerZero Sybil Reporting process.\n\nUsers who staked their STG tokens before the 1-year anniversary of Stargate (17th March 2023) will get a 1.3X multiplier to their score. This will also help to account for a flurry of inorganic activity post-1-year anniversary.\n\nWallets that have posted proposals to Snapshot should not receive an isolated allocation, but rather their regular allocation according to the above descriptions. Also, STG wallets with veSTG as a result of investment in LayerZero Labs will be precluded from this allocation.\n\n10% allocated to LP providers Liquidity Providers play a central role in the function of the Stargate Protocol by ensuring there is sufficient liquidity for bridging to be facilitated through Stargate. While this service is important, they are already being rewarded by pool incentives which pay between 8-20% APY. As such, their allocation should be more constrained.\n\nThis portion of the allocation should also be time and volume-weighted. Every address that interacted with a Stargate pool will be scored based on the amount of liquidity provided in USD.\n\nFor example: User A deposits $1000 on Day 1 On Day 100, User A withdraws $500. Their current Score is 1000100 = 100,000, and continue earning on their $500 On Day 150, User A adds $100. Their Score on Day 150 is 100,000 + 50500 = 125,000. They will now start earning for $600. On Day 200, User A withdraws all liquidity, and stops earning a Score. Their score at this point is 155,000. This will be done for every single Stargate pool, across every chain. Each user will then be ranked according to their score, and allocated accordingly.\n\nAPTOS BRIDGE PROPOSAL In August 2023, StargateDAO took over the AptosBridge from LayerZero following a governance vote, and now owns and operates the bridge. The AptosBridge has had a cumulative $2B in volume over its existence, the majority of which has come since the StargateDAO began actively promoting it. AptosBridge is eligible for an allocation, and the Foundation is recommending the following distribution: 90% allocated to users who have bridged through the AptosBridge, volume-weighted from inception to 1st May. 10% allocated for partner protocols who have built on the AptosBridge, or otherwise driven volume through it. This will be a separate nested RFP process to the Stargate core protocol. Any wallets that are eligible for distribution under the above criteria will be subject to filtering by the LayerZero Sybil criteria.\n\nCLARIFICATIONS\n\nThe Foundation will provide a list of the addresses that are eligible under this RFP, should it pass, and should it be approved by the LayerZero Foundation. Any addresses within this that are marked as sybil by LayerZero will be removed from the list and their allocation will be split amongst the remaining eligible wallets.\n\nThe Stargate Foundation will make reasonable effort to remove any malicious entities that have interacted with Stargate (either hackers via bridging, or staking STG for governance attacks, for example).\n\nThe allocation recommendation sums to 90%, as 10% is recommended to be allocated to the developers. The Stargate Foundation is a not-for-profit entity, and will use this allocation in its entirety for forward-looking budgeting, including but not limited to; marketing, community initiatives, protocol owned liquidity.\n\nCONCLUSION The Stargate Foundation is recommending the above LayerZero Token distribution to the Stargate Community based on the discussions within the Stargate community. The goal of this entire process is to reward real, durable, users and members of the Stargate Community, without compromising the long-term goals of the protocol. The Foundation believes that this proposal is the most equitable, and will reward as many important users as possible.",

      "content": "Background:\n\nThis snapshot delineates the strategic framework for the imminent RFP within the Stargate DAO, a privileged recipient from the LayerZero foundation. After extensive review of the discussion revolving around this topic, a few proposals have emerged as contenders for consideration by the DAO.\n\nThere are 4 main factors that have been discussed: governance participation, LP, bridging, and partner protocols. All of these are accounted for within this proposals, and now the DAO should vote on if they deem it appropriate\n\nThe following are divided between the 90% left of RFP allocation after dev’s 10% cut.\n\nProposal\n\n-38.5% to Bridgers, 5k minimum total volume, capped max 750k, linear\n\nReason: Exclusive users of the Stargate bridge, provides revenue for the protocol. Very important key players within the Stargate ecosystem. Should be allocated for their loyalty + promotion of our product.\n\n-36.25% to veSTG voters contingent upon weight of all votes, ANY AMOUNT OF veSTG IS ELIGIBLE AS LONG AS IT REACHES CUMULATIVE MINIMUM OF 100 veSTG VOTE WEIGHT; EVEN IF YOU VOTE 10 veSTG 10 TIMES AS LONG AS IT REACHES 100 veSTG MINIMUM TOTAL (can vote with less than 100 veSTG, as long as it collectively makes up for 100 veSTG or more then you are eligible, see example), max 2m veSTG (CUMULATIVE; For example if you voted 4 times with 25 veSTG you are eligible/if you voted 5 times with 20 veSTG, or any other figure to cumulatively make up 100 veSTG in weight), linear\n\nReason: The decisions of the DAO revolve around governance, therefore building the protocol. Moreover, locking proves commitment to the protocol while participation of governance demonstrates active interest.\n\n-25% to LP with minimum 1 week of providing + $250 minimum, capped $5m maximum, linear/time weighted (days x amount example: providing $50 for 10 days, $20 for 25 days, or any other figure such as, as long as it hits the one week requirement and collectively equals out to $500 or more based on days x amount)\n\nReason: Protocol’s backbone, without them there would be no foundation for the protocol to run on. Allocate to these providers for their loyalty.\n\n-0.15% to Proposers\n\nReason: The decisions of the DAO revolve around governance, therefore building the protocol. Proposers have nearly no chance of being sybil, while taking risk to play a key role in governance.\n\n-0.1% to ThinkTank\n\nReason: Core community members, must be accounted for. Have contributed many great thoughts.\n\nExecution:\n\nThe foundation will submit an RFP to the LayerZero foundation with the winning outcome as soon as vote ends. Addresses accounted for based on said proposal to be submitted by June 10th. Allocations to be distributed by LayerZero foundation thereafter.\n\nSummary:\n\nAn RFP allocation has been given to Stargate DAO and will need to be distributed based on the DAO’s opinions. The main factors discussed (governance, LP, bridging, partner protocols) are accounted for within this proposal. The community will now decide on appropriate weighing via vote.",

      "title": "Stargate ImmuneFi Bug Bounty Program",
      "content": "Background:\n\nWithin the crypto industry, the security space and its challenges are ever evolving. One of these challenges is the optimization of the vulnerability disclosure process for projects, where the stakes are typically much higher than in the traditional model. The crypto industry regularly sees a wide range of security incidents that affect values in the millions of dollars to the hundreds of millions of dollars. There are fortunately a vast number of security researchers in the space that offer their time and expertise towards protecting against such incidents via responsible disclosures, but unfortunately just as often it’s their blackhat counterparts aiming to profit from exploits.\n\nThe nature of the amount of potential funds at risk leads to the need for increased incentives as part of a bug bounty program, acting as both an attractive offer to those who could be swayed to operate maliciously, as well as a justified reward to those with pure intentions.\n\nWith the imminent launch of Stargate V2, Stargate should look towards the publication of a comprehensive bug bounty program covering the assets and impacts in scope, tiers of rewards, and any other relevant information in order to maximise the chances of a positive outcome in the event that there is ever a vulnerability found within the protocol. This program should be hosted with a bug bounty platform such as Immunefi to ensure awareness of its existence is widespread.\n\nStargate V2’s codebase is entirely open-source and can be viewed here. It has also been through an industry-leading 4 external audits - all audit reports publicly available here.\n\nProposal:\n\nHaving looked at existing live programs on Immunefi for reference and inspiration, the following is proposed:\n\nThe creation of a bug bounty program with a maximum reward of $10M, showing a commitment to the security of Stargate v2 and its TVL; it should cover the core smart contracts that make up the Stargate Protocol on each chain. The final list of smart contracts will be listed publicly on the ImmuneFi Bug Bounty page, and decided in collaboration with the ImmuneFi experts. \n\nAny bounty payment for this program should be directly out of Stargate POL, with a requirement of a KYC process prior to final payment. The management of the program should be facilitated by the Stargate Foundation, with transparency into the process in a way that does not expose any sensitive security information prior to any resolution.\n\nRewards by Threat Level:\n\n- Critical: A minimum of $100K, or 10% of the value at risk at the time of report submission with a hard cap of $10M\n\n- High: A minimum of $10K, up to $100K\n\n- Medium: A minimum of $5K, up to $10K\n\n- Low: A minimum of $1K, up to $5K \n\n\nImpacts in Scope (Smart Contract):\n\nCritical:\n\n- Exploits resulting in the permanent locking, loss, or theft of user funds\n- Attacker ability to modify Stargate UA settings\n\nHigh:\n\n- Exploit leading to theft of unclaimed rewards\n\nMedium: \n\n- Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)\n\nLow:\n\n- A bug or incorrect configuration of contracts that produces incorrect outputs or behavior but does not impact participants or the protocol in a material way. \n\nThis bug bounty program details should be further fleshed out with Immunefi in accordance to their typical best practices regarding impacts, what is out of scope, and any other rules that should be in place.\n\nExecution:\n\nStargate will create a comprehensive bug bounty program hosted on Immunefi with finalised details, with the administration of this program being performed on an ongoing basis. The DAO will hold 5X the lowest payout in the ImmuneFi vault to boost trust.\n\nSummary:\n\nA bug bounty program should be created with a maximum payout of $10M with additional reward tiers in place. The publication and management of the final bug bounty program should be facilitated by the Stargate Foundation; they should work directly with Immunefi to complete this on behalf of the StargateDAO. The Stargate Foundation will cover all costs associated with initiating the set-up of this program, alongside the ImmuneFi annual management fee. Hence this program would be run at no additional cost to the DAO.",

      "title": "Proposal to wind down support for the Fantom Ecosystem",
      "content": "Background\n\nOn May 29th, the StargateDAO decided to wind-down support for the anyUDSC asset in the Fantom ecosystem, following the Force Majeure announced by Multichain. On July 15th, StargateDAO voted to support the new safehaven assets issued by LayerZero in the Fantom ecosystem.\n\nSince July 2023, these assets have been supported within the Stargate protocol, averaging around $7M in incentivised TVL, and about $1-5M in 7-day volume for this pool.\n\nOn April 4th 2024, the Fantom Foundation announced that they are issuing a new version of a canonical stablecoin, called USDC.e, bridged from Ethereum.\n\nProposal\n\nThe Stargate Foundation is recommending that StargateDAO deprecates support for the lzUSDC pool on Fantom. This pool is currently not generating enough volume to recoup the costs spent on incentives. Further, the safehaven lzUSDC assets provided by LayerZero are likely to be deprecated in their use across Fantom’s DeFi ecosystem, and hence bridging volume will only decrease.\n\nAdditionally, removing this pool from the protocol will free up capital allocated on its pathways, increasing the thickness of other pathways within Stargate V1, reducing fees and increasing liquidity on these USDC pathways. This also means Stargate can handle more volume on these pathways.\n\nThe DAO should deprecate this pool ahead of Stargate V2 launch, and can revisit the idea of supporting the Fantom ecosystem once there has been meaningful adoption of any new native stablecoin. The asset will continue to be available within the UI until all users have removed their liquidity from the ecosystem.\n\nThe DAO should also remove all LP positions from various DEXes across the Fantom ecosystem. It should additionally sell all rewards tokens that it has accumulated over the period for POL to use within the Stargate protocol.\n\nExecution\n\nUpon approval, the lzUSDC pool on Fantom will be disconnected from all over pools, and put into withdrawal only mode. Additionally, users will only be able to bridge in 1 direction: from Fantom -> Ethereum, in order to successfully wind-down the asset. The ability to withdraw will always\n\nSummary\n\nGiven the recent announcement from the Fantom Foundation of a new canonical stablecoin, Stargate should wind-down its support for the Fantom ecosystem as the lzUSDC asset is not likely to generate enough volume and revenue through the protocol to justify its maintenance. This should be done ASAP, ahead of Stargate v2 launch.",

      "title": "Stargate V2",
      "content": "Summary\n\nStargate V2 can be the cheapest and most interoperable bridge in DeFi. Stargate V2 should be built to address some of the pain-points of Stargate V1; expensive onchain accounting, static credit mechanism and slow expansion to new chains. Stargate V2 will introduce transaction batching in order to provide the absolute cheapest bridging experience across all pathways. Stargate V2 also introduces dynamic credit allocation to better handle volume surges across particular pathways, managed by an AI Planning Module. Hydra is introduced as Stargate’s expansion into Bridging as a Service, allowing new chains to access unlimited liquidity across all Stargate chains.\n\nPrimo, MaxPower and Lamps ran through this entire proposal on Stargates recent community call.\n\nVideo link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKcXOTYChB8\n\nBackground\n\nStargate Finance launched on 17th March 2022 and has lived immutably onchain for over two years. It launched on 7 chains and has since expanded via DAO mandate1 to 14 chains. It supports over 10 types of asset pools and has over 40 OFTs bridging through the UI.\n\nProposed Architecture for Stargate V2\nThe following section will break down proposed and potential architecture changes for the Stargate protocol. Each section will come with an Explanation and Proposal\n\nThe Bus - Transaction Batching\n\nIntroduction\n\nEvery single Stargate V1 transaction currently has three parts to the gas fee paid by the user;\n\n-Source chain gas fee\n-LayerZero message fee (typically very low)\n-Destination chain gas fee With all three of these fees grouped into 1, and all paid on the source chain, Stargate V1 could sometimes become quite expensive, ranging from $0.50 on cheap pathways, to up to $50-$100 on pathways to Ethereum Mainnet.\n\nWith the introduction of LayerZero V2, applications can now batch their LayerZero cross-chain message - meaning that any arbitrary number of users can submit their source chain transactions and pay an amortized portion of BOTH the LayerZero message and destination transaction fee.\n\nThe Bus - This would be the option within Stargate for users to use batched transactions to reduce their costs by over 95% compared to Stargate V1. Users will still have the option to pay for a full cost, faster transaction if they so choose, meaning each individual user can make their own decision on cost vs. latency. This concept can be thought of through a “bus versus taxi” analogy in the example below.\n\nEach bus would have a configurable number of ‘seats’, and once each of the seats has been purchased or someone pays for the bus to depart at less than full, the bus departs to destination chain. Each taxi is a 1-to-1 transaction that ‘departs’ to the destination chain as soon as source chain finality is achieved.\n\nAs a practical example, if user A wants to bridge from Arbitrum to Optimism and they are presented with two options;\n\n-Buy a ‘bus ticket’ on a bus that has 6 seats. They will pay for a very cheap source chain transaction to record their transaction on source and pay ⅙th of the LayerZero message (and destination chain fee). The tradeoff is that the transaction only moves to the destination chain when the ‘Bus’ is full, i.e. when all 6 seats have been paid for (by other users, or the same user). The user trades off some speed for reduced cost.\n-Alternatively, the user may choose to take a Taxi. In this case, they pay the full message fee, but get the advantage that their transaction goes through immediately. It is worth noting that while this is akin to a regular transaction on Stargate V1, it is still significantly cheaper due to gas optimizations made to the contracts. The user trades of some cost for increased speed.\n\nAI-Planning Module - Dynamic Credits & Fees\n\nProposal\n\nThe credit management system would still live onchain, such that destination state is known and finality is still guaranteed. However, credits are now able to be redistributed across pathways according to volume and user behaviour. The only actor that can do this is a whitelisted entity - dubbed the Artificial Intelligence Planning Module (“AIPM”). The AIPM is an off-chain entity that will be trained on, once available, Stargate V2s bridging data to ensure optimal liquidity, slippage and fees for the protocol.\n\nThe AIPM would be limited to the following abilities:\n\n-The AIPM cannot control funds, LP, or any underlying assets within Stargates pools.\n-It can dynamically distribute credits across the pathways that have gone below a certain threshold, ensuring that liquidity is available on the busiest pathways. The result of this is deeper liquidity and less slippage for the user.\n-It can dynamically adjust fees and rewards, from a limitedfund pool, to ensure users are incentivised to balance Stargates pools across all chains.\n-It can adjust Stargate’s protocol fee to guarantee that Stargate is always the cheapest route, thereby maximising for volume and profit for the protocol.\n\nHydra: Bridging-as-a-Service\n\nHydra operates via Stargate’s core pools, which reside on chains with native assets (e.g., Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, etc.) and are leveraged to facilitate asset bridging to newer chains lacking native assets.\n\nThe minting of Hydra assets on a new Hydra chain uses the Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) Standard. This process is initiated when an asset, such as USDC, is bridged from a core chain (e.g., Arbitrum) to a Hydra-enabled chain (referred to as Chain X in this context). The bridged assets are securely locked within Stargate’s pool contracts on the origin chain, while an equivalent asset is minted on Chain X. A basic outline of the Hydra process goes as follows:\n\n-When a user bridges USDC from Arbitrum to Chain X, their USDC assets get locked in the secure USDC pool on Arbitrum, and an asset minted on Chain X.\n-The user’s USDC will always remain in the Pool contract until they decide to return to Arbitrum (or any other Stargate core chain).\n\nThe benefits to the Stargate protocol are;\n\n-All assets that become locked in Stargates pools can be used as credits within Stargates internal accounting, deepening liquidity between liquidity pools.\n-Every $1 bridged using Hydra adds $1 to Protocol Locked Liquidity, reducing the need for incentives at all.\n-A chain electing to use Hydra assets as canonical ensures Stargate remains the best place for bridging to and from this new ecosystem into perpetuity.\n\nThe benefits to a Stargate Hydra chain are:\n\n-Access to all core Stargate chains, along with all current and future Hydra chains\n-Bridging into Chain X from Stargate’s core pools is free, while bridging out of X has a low redemption fee. This encourages users to bridge into these new ecosystems\n-Bridging between X and Y (both Hydra chains) has a nominal convenience fee\n-Full composability between any chains that Stargate is connected to, with unlimited liquidity\n-Hydra eliminates the concept of pathway liquidity, meaning a dApp on Arbitrum could build a cross-chain implementation into Chain X with 0 limits on size.\n-Of course, the same goes for a user no limits on size. No extra fees, 0 slippage.\n\nExecution\n\nUpon approval by the DAO, the Stargate V2 protocol would launch according to the following execution plan:\n\n-Incentives on the Stargate V1 pools should slowly be reduced, eventually falling to 0 after X amount of time. These pools must remain active for X months to ensure applications built on top of Stargate can complete their migration to V2 before shutting down pathways. It’s important to note that Stargate V2 pools/pathways will be redundant to V1, so user experience will not be affected.\n-The Stargate V2 protocol should be deployed to all chains that already have been approved by the DAO, along with the associated assets. A list of these can be found in the Appendix2. There are two notable changes to this list compared to V1:\n-All chains that have recently deployed a native USDC token (Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Base) will have this native token supported rather than the bridged USDC.e token.\n-Klaytn will be the first Hydra chain supported. Future Hydra chains will be deployed in coordination with the Stargate Foundation.\n-48 hours prior to the intended launch date/time, Stargate should open V2 liquidity pools for depositing, with incentives ramped up to launch. This will ensure there is sufficient liquidity on all pathways for Stargate V2 launch.\n-The first version of the AI Planning Module has been built. As V2 goes live, the AI module will be trained on Stargates rolling data over the previous period to optimise for two things:\n-Stargate should always be the cheapest bridge,\n-Stargate should maximise its protocol revenue.\n-Additional fees on Stargate V2 will continue to accrue to the Protocol/DAO as POL.\n-Building on LayerZero V2 means Stargate must choose it’s DVN configuration. Stargate should deploy its own DVN, managed by the Foundation, and use that as a required signer on every Stargate message. Stargate should also use the Nethermind DVN for additional security verification.",

      "title": "Use idle STG/USDC PoL on Fantom to Earn at Equalizer",
      "content": "Summary:\nStargate DAO should Stake their currently idle STG/USDC PoL on Fantom into the Equalizer Gauge\n\nBy doing this, Stargate DAO starts earning EQUAL rewards for it.\n\nNo new Capital is required from treasury for this process.\n\nEntirely self-funded via natural STG Trading Volume\n\nBackground:\nThe proposal highlights a strategic alignment with the upcoming Fantom Sonic Mainnet launch, suggesting that this move could enhance Stargate’s Protocol-owned Liquidity’s earning potential for Stargate DAO in anticipation of increased activity and the new Fantom chain’s increase in prominence.\n\nStargates current Protocol-owned Liquidity (PoL) for Fantom worth $2 Million is sitting idle on Spooky Exchange, where it has not been effectively utilized due to the absence of volume-driven incentives, no allocated token emissions, and zero added on-chain visibility.\n\nEqualizer, which operates a system similar to Velodrome et. al. is well established on Fantom chain (running in its 2nd Year on the chain), proposes this strategy to better engage this liquidity for a mutually beneficial collaboration.\n\nTarget Platform:\nThe proposal recommends moving the PoL held on Fantom (Roughly $2M) to Equalizer, a modern, more dynamic and evolving DEX, to leverage the Starate DAO’s liquidity to earn $EQUAL emissions as reward for this LP, thanks to Equalize’s novel volume-driven fees incentivising Liquidity Provision.\n\nMechanism:\nthe STG liquidity will aim to capture a share of the weekly $EQUAL emissions by appealing to the voters with volume-driven incentives (and in the future, possibly bribes). Right now, the volume being driven on this pair is not directly incentivising any emissions at all. Instead, a hefty 20% of such fees are being paid to Spooky in return for absolutely nothing!\n\nTherefore this proposal aims to start generating returns for this $2M Protocol-owned Liquidity (PoL), while attracting more active liquidity compared to the current setup.\n\nIncentive Structure:\nVolume-based incentivisation (swap fees) will be able to sustain the EQUAL emissions with no additional incentivisation. Right now, there is no direct emission pool for STG liquidity on Spookyswap, a simple switch to Equalizer would generate enough trading fees to place the STG liquidity in the top 5-10 voting incentives and therefore receive $EQUAL emissions at no cost to the DAO.\n\n1 Week of volume on Equalizer, (based on last 6 months of weekly volume), it would be able to capture roughly $5,000+ in $EQUAL emissions for the week.\n\nThis equates to Earnings of more than $250,000 to Stargate DAO paid by Equalizer as a reward for simply staking the existing LP in the Eqaulizer gauge for STG/USDC.\n\nBenefits:\nThe move to Equalizer will yield higher APRs than the present rates at SpookySwap (where the LP is not earning any), coupled with additional support and visibility within a thriving DeFi community and a reputable exchange. Fantom Sonic Mainnet is expected to launch within the next few months, and it is vital that Stargate and the STG token have the visibility they deserve on-chain.\n\nStargate DAO could be able to add at least $250,000 annually to its treasury based on last 6 months of data, without any cost expenses. This directly translates into added intrinsic value for the STG token and all its holders.\n\nLong-term Strategy:\nFuture intention is to lock all $EQUAL rewards into veEQUAL to self-vote on the STG/USDC pool to further amplify Stargate PoL’s earnings. Furthermore, direct bribe allocations from the DAO to enhance these earnings even more, potentially making Fantom one of the top destinations for Stargate users, traders and long-term investors, garnished with these robust APRs for STG’s liquidity providers, including the DAO itself. This vote will give Equalizer the ability to review and strategize with the Stargate team to suggest and make adaptations based on strategy’s efficiency and submit a future proposal to the DAO if we believe that small consistent bribes could return significant amplifications to DAO’s ROIs beyond what is currently being achieved. We look towards a long-term partnership with Stargate and wish to maintain open bilateral communication with the DAO following this proposal.\n\nInitial Steps:\nIf this proposal passes, the following steps are to be performed.\n\nExisting STG/USDC PoL on Fantom will be moved into the Equalizer Gauge.\nFurther Steps:\nDAO may evaluate whether it wants to bribe for earning further Liquidity Incentives and higher rewards\nDAO may evaluate whether it wants to lock its earned EQUAL into veEQUAL to start earning even more rewards on top",

      "content": "Issue statement\n\nStargate Community Calls are not recorded and published. This limits the engagement with the Stargate community and the broader crypto community.\n\nCommunity calls are only available live on Discord and playback is not natively available via the platform. Alternative techniques to record the Discord calls are not being used out of a desire to get stakeholders to attend calls. However, this is not always possible or preferred for stakeholders.\n\nA large proportion of the Stargate Community are unable to attend community calls due to global time zones, security concerns or other commitments.\n\nIn addition, the community calls are only available on one platform. There are over 250,000 followers for the @StargateFinance account on Twitter/X and 422,000 members on Discord. The current audience for these live-only calls are not engaging the maximum possible number of Stargate stakeholders e.g. the 250,000 followers on Twitter/X.\n\nProposal\n\nRecord fortnightly Stargate Community Calls and publish to a range of platforms beyond Discord to maximise audience engagement and support on-demand listening. This could include YouTube Live, X Spaces or other content distribution services.\n\nBudget\n\nA $1.8m annual budget was approved five months ago for the Stargate Foundation with $800k budgeted for Dedicated Support. Part of this Dedicated Support budget was to be used for Community and Marketing, including planning and coordinating community calls. Any expense for recording and publishing these calls should be subsumed by this adequate budget and resources should be redirected to ensuing this critical community engagement channel reaches its maximum audience. Furthermore, making recordings of community calls available to stakeholders should be included in future budgets.\n\nTechnical support\n\nAlthough there is no official way to record Discord calls, third-party apps like Craig Bot, Audacity, OBS, Movavi Screen Recorder etc can easily record voice calls on Discord Server Voice Channels.\n\nAlternatively, use a broadcasting platform that will allow community call recordings can be published on a range of platforms, including Discord and YouTube. Cross platform publishing can be achieved with any number of tools like Crowdfire, Hootsuite, Buffer etc.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Stargate Foundation performs critical work on behalf of the Protocol and the mandate of the Stargate DAO. However, many members of the DAO are denied accessing community calls due to the logistics of engaging a global audience. Recording and broadcasting community calls will improve customer, LP, staker and developer engagement.",

      "title": "Grow POL on Optimism by leveraging Stargate's veVELO vote power on Velodrome",
      "content": "Background\n\nThis proposal aims to maximize the economic upside of Stargate's Protocol Owned Liquidity on Optimism leveraging Stargate’s veVELO position.\nDeploying these assets strategically can allow Stargate to increase the yield on its POL, earn a one-time Velodrome partner bonus of 10K OP tokens (~$30K at current valuation) vested over 1 year, and grow its treasury on Optimism. Details below.\n\nProposal\n\nVelodrome is the central trading and liquidity marketplace on Optimism. Velodrome distributes VELO emissions to liquidity pools weekly based on votes by veVELO (vote-escrow VELO) holders. Protocols can use veVELO vote power or voter incentives (bribes) to attract votes and emissions for their liquidity pairs. \nVoter incentives consistently attract $1.75 to $3 in VELO rewards to pools for every $1 deposited, offering a multiplier effect for protocols. Stargate is uniquely positioned to benefit from this multiplier, as it owns 80-90% of the STG-USDC liquidity on Velodrome, allowing it to capture 80-90% of the resulting VELO rewards. For every $1 in incentives, Stargate could capture $1.4 - $2.5 in rewards each week.\nStargate can also leverage Relay, Velodrome’s veVELO automation layer, to vote for STG-USDC perpetually, compound veVELO rewards, and direct VELO emissions to Stargate’s POL at zero cost to Stargate.\nStargate currently holds approximately 8M in veVELO, 1.6M VELO in LP rewards, and $5M in POL for STG/USDC on Velodrome pools, of which $3.2M is auto-compounding through Yearn’s vault. Stargate has also claimed 10K OP tokens through veVELO votes in the past 6 months, which it can redeploy to extend its reward program on Velodrome.\nTo maximize the combined impact of these assets, Stargate can take the following strategic actions:\nLock the VELO to increase Protocol Owned Votepower position to ~9.5m veVELO and instantly qualify for a one-time 10k OP partner bonus\nDeposit all veVELO into Relay and establish a voting strategy for STG-USDC to perpetually direct VELO rewards to the pool – the Velodrome team will share instructions\nDeposit 2K OP tokens per week for a period of 5 weeks to attract veVELO votes for STG-USDC, boosting the pool’s yield to further grow Stargate’s POL\nMaintain current staked POL on Velodrome and Yearn – claim the resulting VELO rewards every 4 weeks, lock as veVELO and deposit into Relay to grow votepower\nCombined, these steps will boost Stargate's earnings from POL. The 1.6M veVELO will allow Stargate to direct an extra ~$1.2K in weekly emissions to the STG-USDC pool, while the $4k in weekly incentives could result in an estimated $10K per week of rewards on Stargate’s $5M POL. Most of these rewards will automatically grow Stargate’s POL through Yearn.\nThe proposal aligns with Stargate’s mandate to incentivize liquidity if the resulting rewards can yield $1.5 for every $1 deployed.\n\nOP GovNFT Program\n\nThe GovNFT is an OP position vested over 1 year that allows participation in governance, with an estimated value of $40K. This would provide an additional boost to Stargate's program.\n\nExecution\n-Stargate will claim pending VELO rewards on Velodrome. \n-Stargate will lock the claimed VELO as veVELO and deposit its veVELO into Relay. Velodrome will create a Relay strategy which will continuously vote for STG-USDC and compound rewards into additional veVELO. Velodrome will provide detailed instructions for using Relay.\n-Stargate will deposit 2K in OP per week for voters of STG-USDC on Velodrome for a period of 5 weeks.\n-Stargate will receive a 10K OP GovNFT (worth $30K at current $OP prices) for locking more than 1M veVELO. This is a locked OP position vesting over 1 year that will allow Stargate to delegate and participate in OP governance.\nStargate will claim VELO rewards on POL, lock them as veVELO, and deposit them into Relay every 4 weeks for a period of 52 weeks.",

This proposal aligns with the Aptos Foundation's mission to support the growth of the Aptos ecosystem by leveraging LayerZero's technology for bridging and interoperability solutions across blockchains. \n\nDifferentiating Features of the Aptos Network \nAptos is the blockchain network with everything you need to build your big idea.\n\nType Safety: Move, the programming language for Aptos smart contracts, is highly type-safe/strongly typed, reducing errors and enhancing security for developers.\n\nResource Management: Aptos introduces a unique approach where resources are created, passed around, and managed with customizable capabilities (creation, storage, deletion, copying) rather than merely modifying a database.\n\nTransaction Speed: Aptos achieves sub-second finality, significantly reducing wait times for transaction completion.\n\nAptos Execution Engine: A multi-threaded, in-memory parallel execution engine capable of processing over 160,000 nontrivial Move transactions per second, showcasing exceptional throughput.\n\nScalability: Aptos supports parallel execution, allowing developers to maximize speedup without the need for declaring dependencies upfront, overcoming the scalability limits of sequential execution.\n\nInnovations:\n-MOVE: A programming language designed for Web3, focusing on scarcity and access control. It ensures asset scarcity by default and supports representing any asset as a resource.\n-Block-STM: A parallel execution engine for smart contracts based on Software Transactional Memory, ensuring deterministic outcomes for transactions grouped in blocks.\n\nQuorum Store: Separates data dissemination from metadata ordering, allowing for asynchronous, parallel data dissemination among validators.\n\nNarwhal / Tusk:\n-Narwhal: A DAG-based mempool designed for efficient transaction storage and dissemination, maintaining high performance even in asynchronous networks.\n-Tusk: A zero-message asynchronous consensus protocol addressing latency and lost liveness issues, capable of achieving 160,000 transactions per second with less than 1 seconds of latency.\n\nProposal\nThis proposal includes the initial phase beginning in February 2024, offering one or more grants of APT tokens to StargateDAO for encouraging increased usage of the Aptos Bridge. The proposal also commits to increasing transactional limits for both inbound and outbound transfers on the Aptos Bridge, providing marketing support and educational resources to promote the Aptos Bridge and Aptos ecosystem, and collaborating with the Aptos network and ecosystem partners. \n\nExecution\n-Initial Setup and Launch: The kickoff grant and incentive structure will be provisioned to start on or around February 19th, 2024. \n\n-Removing transaction limits: For both inbound and outbound transfers on the Aptos Bridge. \n--With the introduction of Pre-Crime to the Aptos Bridge, there is no need for any transfer limits to protect against malicious activity, as this is now done on a per-transaction basis. Pre-Crime is a novel mechanism built into LayerZero messaging that enables applications to intercept malicious transactions before they are delivered to the destination chain. Pre-Crime simulates incoming transactions against an application-defined rule set — or invariants — in the application’s Pre-Crime contract and evaluates the global application state across all the chains. If any rules within the set fail, then the transaction will be blocked at the source. This means the DAO can feel confident in lifting limits entirely, enabling a better user experience and facilitation of greater volume.\n\nMarketing and Education: Jointly develop and launch a go-to-market campaign focusing on educating users about LayerZero, the Aptos Bridge, and the Aptos blockchain.\n\nEvaluation and Potential Expansion: Jointly review the initiative's success beginning in March 2024 and regularly thereafter as needed for Aptos Foundation to decide on whether to continue providing APT grants, any potential adjustments to grant amounts, or the need for further support. \n\nSummary\nThis proposal to the StargateDAO represents a comprehensive strategy to both bolster the Aptos ecosystem and expand the reach and depth of LayerZero assets. By introducing APT provisioning, as well as the lifting of transfer limits, providing marketing support and education resources, and committing to ecosystem support, this proposal aims to drive significant growth in the usage of LayerZero via the Aptos Bridge and in the Aptos ecosystem.",

On January 1st, 2024, a newly approved function was implemented where 5% of bridge transaction fees are converted to $gSTG. $gSTG has the potential to increase bridge transaction volume and reward holders, but will $STG face market cap reduction if a derivative token supply is increased, or will the increase in bridge volume contribute to greater value for users. \n\nProposal\n- Increase $gSTG from 5% of bridge fees to 7.5% bridge fees to further incentive swap usage and reward the Stargate community. Maintain $gSTG biannual rewards distribution timeline to incentive swap prioritization and bolster market sentiment. Currently, for every $1M of swap fees generated, $50,000 will be allocated to the $gSTG treasury. This proposal is suggesting to contribute $75,000 to $gSTG for every $1M of bridge fees, which will later be distributed to bridge users based on wallet activity. A majority vote of 51% or greater is required for the protocol to implement this new addition. \n\nWhat is $gSTG and when is the first distribution?\n- Stargate DAO has voted to implement $gSTG rewards for the first distribution which is live for users from January 15, 2024 to January 30, 2023. Each $STG holder is eligibility if their wallet is older than 7 days and they have made a TXN with $STG. $gSTG distribution rate will be based on wallet solvency levels and bridge volume. \n\nIf you haven't already, check [HERE](https://gold-stargate.events) if you are eligibile for the Phase 1 $gSTG Rewards Distribution. \n\nExecution\n- If this proposal receives a majority vote of 51% of greater, $gSTG treasury allocation rate will be increase from 5% to 7.5% to further reward swap users and hopefully increase overall bridge volume. \n\nIf the new rewards allocation rate is accepted it will be implement in the 2024 Q2 distribution. \n\nDon't forget to check if you are eligible for the Phase 1 $gSTG distribution if you have been an active $STG trader and bridge user.",

      "title": "Utilize unclaimed tokens on Velodrome to increase Stargate's weekly earnings and qualify for govNFT",
      "content": "Background\n\nStargate is in a unique position to extend its initial program on Velodrome at zero cost to the protocol by redeploying unclaimed liquidity rewards and veVELO voting rewards.\nDeploying these rewards strategically can allow Stargate to generate up to ~$15K in profit per week, as well as receive a on-time Velodrome partner bonus of 10K OP tokens (~$40K at current valuation) vested over 1 year. Details below.\n\nProposal\n\nVelodrome is the central trading and liquidity marketplace on Optimism. Velodrome distributes VELO emissions to liquidity pools weekly based on votes by veVELO (vote-escrow VELO) holders. Protocols can use veVELO vote power or voter incentives (bribes) to attract votes and emissions for their liquidity pairs.\nCurrently, protocols direct an average of $2-$3 in VELO emissions for every $1 of voter incentives, equivalent to a 1.1X-2.5X multiplier. Stargate is uniquely positioned to benefit from this incentive multiplier, as the protocol can capture a large share of VELO emissions through POL and rewards through veVELO votes.\nStargate has accumulated ~1.5M VELO in LP rewards and ~$60K in veVELO rewards (mainly STG, USDC, and OP) from its veVELO position, which Stargate can deploy to boost STG liquidity while continuing to accrue rewards at no additional cost, as follows:\nLock the VELO rewards to increase its Protocol Owned Votepower position to ~9M veVELO\nDeposit the veVELO into Relay (Velodrome's automated voting system)\nDeploy $6K in weekly incentives for the STG-USDC pool per week on Velodrome over a period of 10 weeks, using the veVELO rewards to be claimed.\nMaintain current staked POL on Velodrome. Claim VELO rewards, lock as veVELO and deposit into Relay every 4 weeks for a period of 52 weeks.\nCombined, these steps will boost Stargate's liquidity and voting rewards. The 1.5M veVELO will allow Stargate to direct ~$1.2K in weekly emissions to the STG-USDC pool. And at a 16% APR, Stargate will earn an estimated $15K per week on its $5M POL (staked on Velodrome and Yearn).\nThrough Relay, Stargate's veVELO position will automatically vote for STG-USDC each week and compound rewards into more veVELO to increase the protocol-owned votes for the pool. \nTour de OP Program\nVelodrome is also currently offering 12K OP in additional weekly incentives to protocols participating in the flywheel. Stargate's pool would automatically qualify to receive a share of these rewards, potentially representing a 15-20% boost to Stargate's program. \nVelodrome Relay\nRelay is an automated veVELO manager, which can vote, claim rewards and compound veVELO on behalf of Stargate. This will significantly improve the experience of Stargate operations on Velodrome by removing the need to execute veVELO related transactions.\nOP GovNFT Program\nThe GovNFT is an OP position vested over 1 year that allows participation in governance, with an estimated value of $40K. This would provide an additional boost to Stargate's program.\n\nExecution\n\nStargate will claim pending voting rewards and liquidity rewards on Velodrome. \n\nStargate will lock the claimed VELO portion as veVELO.\n\nStargate will allocate the rest of the claimed rewards (e.g., STG, OP, USDC) as incentives to STG-USDC for a 10-week period, depositing 1/10th each week.\n\nStargate will deposit its veVELO into Relay. Velodrome will create a Relay strategy which will continuously vote for STG-USDC and compound rewards into additional veVELO. Velodrome will provide detailed instructions for using Relay.\n\nStargate will receive a 10K OP GovNFT (worth $40K at current $OP prices) for locking more than 1M veVELO. This is a locked OP position vesting over 1 year that will allow Stargate to delegate and participate in OP governance.\n\nStargate will claim VELO rewards on POL, lock them as veVELO, and deposit them into Relay every 4 weeks for a period of 52 weeks.",

      "title": "Stargate Deployment on Manta Network",
      "content": "Introduction\n\nManta Network is the modular ecosystem for zero-knowledge applications. Manta Pacific, its modular L2 chain, provides a scalable and inexpensive gas-fee environment for ZK applications to deploy simply using Solidity. Manta Pacific is the first Modular L2 with Celestia DA and one of the largest OP Stack chains with zkEVM in its future roadmap by leveraging Polygon CDK integrated with LayerZero.\nManta Pacific is one of the fastest growing Ethereum L2 chains with more than 550m+ TVL.\n\nProposal\n\nWe propose for Stargate to launch on Manta Pacific Layer 2 as early as possible. We are also working closely with the LayerZero team to ensure an LZ endpoint will be deployed on Manta following our launch.\nThe Manta team would like to request two pools: \nETH (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain and Avalanche)\nSTONE (Ethereum and Manta)\nIntroducing the New Paradigm, we will offer Manta tokens as an incentives to get the adoption of ETH and STONE on Manta Pacific. \nETH (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain and Avalanche)\nTo incentivize this launch and campaign, Manta Pacific proposes a 1-year grant distributed as a guaranteed 20k Manta Tokens monthly over the next 1 year distributed in 12 equal installments and in addition to Manta Paradigm which is an innovative and transparent on-chain incentive program. To kick off the agreement as soon as the proposal is accepted, the first tranche of 20k will be paid in advance for developers driving adoption. This will allow Stargate to capture user growth in the Manta ecosystem, while providing developers and users with crucial bridging infrastructure.\nThe total grant will be 240k Manta tokens and this pool of ETH should start with immediate effect. \nThis will help ensure that enough liquidity is present at launch for users to transfer ETH.\nStone (Ethereum and Manta)\nTo incentivize the launch of Stone, Manta Pacific proposes another 12 months of grant distribution as a guaranteed 20k Manta token monthly over the next 1 year with a total of 240k. This will be distributed monthly. The Bridge for Stone token should be live and effective from March 2024.\nThis will allow Stargate to capture user growth of Stone adoption in the native Manta ecosystem.\nTo summarize the plan overall, Manta requested the Stargate team to approve two pools for bridging\n1. ETH: \n20k Manta Tokens Monthly for the next 12 months (In total 240k)\nThis bridge should be implemented as soon as the proposal is approved \n2. STONE\n20k Manta Tokens Monthly for the next 12 months (In total 240k)\nThis bridge should be implemented starting from March 2024\nIn total Manta Network will provide 480k Manta tokens in next 1 year to Stargate for accepting this proposal\n\nExecution\n\nStargate Protocol enables ETH transfers between Manta, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain, and Avalanche. This integration opens up new access points for value transfer, creating additional opportunities to capture fees for the Protocol. As a result, users can enjoy enhanced flexibility and efficiency when transferring ETH across these blockchain networks. With help of Stone bridge Stargate will bring an additional benefit for StakeStone native bridge to push it for Cross-chain adoption\n\nSummary\n\nManta Pacific has successfully launched on Mainnet and aims to position Stargate as a top-tier protocol within its ecosystem. This strategic move presents a mutually beneficial opportunity: Stargate can emerge as a leading bridge within Manta Pacific's ecosystem, allowing users to seamlessly bridge assets in and out of the platform.\nThe expansion to a new chain will significantly propel Stargate's mission to become the foremost liquidity cross-chain layer. This advancement will offer a broader array of choices and heightened trading volume on its platform. Not only will this expansion boost revenue for the DAO, but it will also cement Stargate's role as a vital element of the Manta ecosystem. Moreover, this expansion will contribute to fortifying a more resilient DeFi infrastructure on Manta, elevating the network's utility and providing additional value to its users.",

      "content": "Toupee Tech Summary\nAn entirely new protocol on Base built with features from Solidly. Toupee is a coordinator of incentives within ecosystems built on the Solidly model. Protocols that stake LP tokens in Toupee earn extra rewards in oWIG emissions on top of the rewards earned from the underlying protocol.\n\nNo long-term token locking. Toupee operates with a 1-week epoch system, which is also the max token lock duration. Gone are the days of multi-year token locks.\n\n4:1 bribing efficiency. Currently our partner protocols are getting $4 for every $1 they put in bribes, the best in the Base ecosystem. Toupee is also matching bribes for all new partner protocols dollar for dollar.\n\nLiquidation-free loans borrowed against your voting position. Our native token WIG was launched on a bonding curve with a floor price of 1 ETH. Users have the ability to borrow ETH back against their vWIG (staked WIG). This means they have no risk of liquidation and can enjoy the benefits of a totally liquid position while earning profit on protocol fees and bribes.\n\nThe effectiveness of the voting flywheel is highlighted by Toupee’s quickly growing TVL which has reached almost $1.5M as of the time of this writing.\n\nProposal: We will airdrop you voting power to be used in our flywheel, and plug in Stargate pools which can receive bribes and emissions. For pools that you may want to incentivize, our bribing efficiency is currently 4:1 for every dollar put in.\n\nMotivation\n\nProtocols incentivizing on Toupee have been achieving an efficiency ratio of 4X. In other words, for every dollar in voter incentives, participants in our ecosystem are currently directing $4 worth of oWIG emissions and rewards towards their pools. Protocols can leverage this high efficiency to attract more liquidity at a low cost.",

      "content": "Summary\nProposal to increase the Protocol-owned liquidity allocated to Arrakis PALM to keep conducting capital efficient market making for STG on Mainnet Uniswap v3 to earn yield.\n\nBackground & Motivation\nBack in April, the Stargate DAO decided to open a PALM vault with $500k worth of STG and $500k worth of USDC, aiming to create a secure UniswapV3 oracle.\nThis vault was successfully funded on June 1st. After observing its performance for half a year, the Arrakis team would like to review its outcomes and propose an opportunity to strengthen the partnership between both entities. Arrakis believes that the Stargate DAO can significantly benefit from an expanded PALM vault capable of facilitating markets with deeper liquidity.\n\nProposal\nThe Arrakis team believes that Stargate could also benefit from allocating a bigger share of their liquidity to Arrakis.\n\nCurrently the biggest pools, such as Balancer and Curve, are not making the most out of their liquidity, due to the limitations of their less sophisticated design. The Stargate DAO could boost their revenues by providing their PALM vault with more resources, while continuing to farm both CRV and AURA with their existing portfolio strategy.\n\nBecause of that, our proposal is to increase PALM liquidity on Ethereum mainnet by shifting some of the pre-existing POL on Balancer and Curve.\n\nRequested funds: $2.4M worth of STG and USDC ($1.6M from Balancer + $0.8M from Curve)\nBy doing so, Stargate would reallocate roughly 7% of their POL.",

      "title": "Integrate Stargate with NEAR via Aurora",
      "content": "Ref Finance team is bringing Orderly Network’s past proposal back alive and updating the incentives here below after careful communication with the Orderly team.\n\nExecutive Summary\nThis governance proposal, presented by Orderly Network, outlines the integration of NEAR Protocol, a Layer 1 blockchain, with Stargate, a cross-chain and interconnectivity protocol powered by Layer Zero. The integration will be facilitated via Aurora, the EVM execution environment of the NEAR blockchain. This integration is significant for both NEAR Protocol and Stargate in that it marks the first instance of Stargate integrating with a non-EVM chain, which represents a groundbreaking step in the journey towards greater blockchain interoperability. It also includes an incentive program to bootstrap liquidity for USDC, and a decentralized Stargate frontend running on NEAR’s Blockchain Operating System (BOS).\n\n\nProposal\nThe central component of this proposal is the creation of a USDC pool on Aurora (NEAR), which will serve as a vital bridge connecting NEAR Protocol to Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and BNB Chain.\n\n\nObjectives\n- Enhanced Interoperability: The integration aims to connect NEAR Protocol, a non-EVM chain, to the Stargate ecosystem via Aurora. This allows NEAR to interact with other blockchain networks, amplifying its reach and utility.\n- First Non-EVM Integration: This integration is of particular significance as it marks the first instance of Stargate integrating with a non-EVM blockchain. It highlights Stargate's commitment to expanding its cross-chain capabilities and supporting a wider range of blockchain networks, as well as bringing more use cases, revenue, and fees to the Stargate community.\n- Liquidity Boost: By offering an incentive program to bootstrap USDC liquidity on NEAR Protocol through Stargate, we intend to increase trading activity, liquidity depth, and adoption of USDC within the NEAR ecosystem.\n\n\nMotivation\nThis integration initiative has been strongly motivated by recent developments in the NEAR ecosystem:\n- Native USDC on NEAR: The recent launch of native USDC on NEAR Protocol has created a foundation for enhanced DeFi activities within the NEAR ecosystem. It offers a battle-tested and efficient stablecoin option for users and developers.\n- First Perpetuals (Perps) Market on NEAR: Orderly Network, as the author of this proposal, recently launched the first perps market on NEAR Protocol. This significant milestone has highlighted the growth potential of the NEAR ecosystem and the demand for liquidity and interoperability solutions. Orderly Network uses USDC as collateral for perps.\n\n\nReasons for Integration\nFor NEAR Protocol:\n- Access to a Cross-Chain Ecosystem: NEAR Protocol will gain access to Stargate's interconnected ecosystem, allowing it to collaborate with other blockchain networks, projects, and DeFi applications.\n- Seamless Cross-Chain Transactions: NEAR users will be able to execute cross-chain transactions with ease, fostering a more user-friendly and interconnected blockchain experience.\n- Enhanced Liquidity: The integration opens up opportunities for NEAR's DeFi ecosystem by attracting liquidity providers and traders from the broader Stargate network.\nFor Stargate:\n- Breaking Boundaries: The integration demonstrates Stargate's ability to connect with non-EVM chains, expanding its value proposition as a cross-chain and interconnectivity protocol, as well as showcasing its adaptability and inclusivity.\n- Diverse User Base: It brings NEAR's user base, developers, and projects into the Stargate ecosystem, enhancing network diversity and vibrancy.\nNetwork Effects: As Stargate integrates with more diverse chains, its network effects grow stronger, attracting developers and projects seeking interoperability.\n- Native Integrations: Orderly, Ref, and several other NEAR DeFi applications will integrate Stargate directly into their frontends as the main bridge for their users.\n- Native Assets: NEAR is one of just six chains with both native USDC and native USDT. This represents an opportunity for Stargate to establish itself as the premier bridge for these native assets.\n- Decentralized Frontend: As part of this proposal, the Ref Finance team will build a decentralized frontend for Stargate using BOS.\n\n\nIncentive Program to Bootstrap USDC Liquidity\nTo incentivize liquidity providers to participate in the integration, Orderly Network will offer a $200,000 grant that will be distributed as follows:\n\n\n- $175,000 worth of $AURORA tokens for the first 5 months\n- $25,000 worth of $NEAR tokens for the months 6 and 7\n\n\nWhen these incentives run out, we suggest Stargate should emit $STG tokens commensurate with #SIP 23.\n\n\nStargate Can Position Itself To Be The Primary Bridge For Native Assets\nWhile the Rainbow Bridge currently offers wrapped assets, NEAR is transitioning towards native assets. This presents a unique opportunity for Stargate, as it provides a more versatile solution for bridging native assets between chains.\n\n\nOrderly Network (and potentially other ecosystem projects) plan to actively educate users about the bridging of USDC between NEAR and other chains via Stargate. This campaign aims to raise awareness, attract liquidity providers, and drive adoption of this landmark integration.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe integration of NEAR Protocol via Aurora with Stargate is a historic milestone in the journey toward cross-chain interoperability. This integration showcases Stargate's commitment to inclusivity and its capacity to connect with non-EVM chains, expanding its reach and utility.\n\n\nOrderly Network invites the NEAR Protocol and Stargate communities to unite in this transformative endeavor, fostering collaboration, innovation, and growth within the decentralized finance space. Together, we will create a more interconnected and vibrant blockchain ecosystem, setting the stage for further integrations and advancements.",

      "title": "Stargate Deployment On Meter (Pathway Change)",
      "content": "Based on Stargate team’s feedback on the previous governance proposal vote https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x57dfc29fe901e154f294e9e5fc6f7b26e58e4f9446d2d131168bb4531bd2a448 , we created a new proposal for the Meter deployment with only USDC and fewer pathway support.  The most up to date proposal can be found at https://commonwealth.im/stargatetoken/discussion/12864-stargate-deployment-on-meter \nThe following is a copy of the new proposal :\n\nBackground \nMeter.io had been working with Layerzero team to enable Layerzero endpoint from Meter to multiple blockchains.  Today Layerzero is one of the top transaction generating applications on Meter mainnet.  In this proposal we are aiming to deploy Stargate on Meter mainnet to allow on/off major crypto assets from multiple blockchains to Meter and bring more activities to Stargate.\nAbout Meter.io\nMeter is a high performance blockchain built on hybrid PoS/PoW and HotStuff consensus.  It is Ethereum compatible, highly decentralized (currently 337 consensus nodes, scalable to thousands) with unique features like MEV/front running resistant, instant finality and a PoW created flatcoin for payments and transaction fees.  Meter has a unique feature lists that is taylor made for decentralized financial applications:\nCensorship resistant.  Meter’s highly decentralized consensus ensures the network is highly decentralized and robust.  Transactions will be processed smoothly even the network is under attacks.\nHigh throughput and instant finality designed for trading.  Meter is not only capable of processing thousand of transaction per second but also each ensuring each transaction in the blockchain is finalized with no possibility of rollbacks.  \nFair transaction ordering.  Each year, blockchain users lost billions of dollars due to MEV and front running attacks when they use Ethereum, L2 and other blockchains.  Meter is the only blockchain that is built from ground up to be MEV/front running resistant.  Users will enjoy the safe and smooth trading environment provided by Meter.\nFully decentralized flatcoin to build the future DeFi stack and ensure transaction costs both low and stable.  Meter has a dual token design, governance token MTRG used for PoS and security and gas token MTR created by PoW and used for paying transactions fees and bidding newly emitted MTRG.  Creating one MTR requires 10kwh of electricity burnt on mainstream Bitcoin miners.  Such design creates an economic equilibrium for MTR and made it the only non collateralized flatcoin that maintains its value over the past 3 years since its launch.  MTR is aim to complete Satoshi’s original vision of a sound money that is independent of the fiat system.\nCurrently Meter has a healthy ecosystem including DEX, lending, synthetic assets, liquid staking and games.  The existing bridge only supports USDC, USDT and ETH transfers between Ethereum and the Meter mainnet. The goal of this proposal is to improve the users experience by allowing them to on/off ramp Meter from multiple blockchains.\nProposal\nBased on the Stargate Foundation’s feedbacks.  We would like to create a new proposal for Stargate’s deployment on Meter:\nWe propose to launch Stargate initially on the Meter mainnet with the support of the following endpoints in Stargate V1:\nUSDC (between Avalanche, Arbitrum, Polygon and USDC.eth Meter)\nThe Meter community is very excited with the upcoming release of the Stargate v2 Hydra and would like to be one of the first adopters to Hydra on the following pathways:\nUSDT (between Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Polygon and Meter USDT.eth or Stargate could create a stgUSDT and Meter community will create liquidity pool to facilitate the conversion)\nETH(Ethereum, Arbitrum, OP and Meter)\nAll the detailed pathways and provisions may be adjusted based on the discussion with the Stargate Foundation at the time of implementation.\nThe Meter team will make sure necessary OFT proxies/compatibility layers will be implemented to the existing tokens to accommodate the technical requirements from the Stargate and Layerzero Foundation for Stargate V1 and future V2 deployments.\nUser incentives and application supports:\nPools deployed on Meter should receive STG emission based on SIP#23\nThe TVL incentive on the Stargate USDT & ETH LP pool is expected to receive Meter’s network token MTRG as rewards based on the [Meter TVL Incentive Program](https://docs.meter.io/developer-documentation/meter-developer-incentives/meter-tvl-incentive-program), which will provide 7.5% to the TVL locked on Stargate.  For example a $6M pool will receive $37.5k/month incentives in MTRG, which should cover the incentives needed to support the pool by itself.\nMeter community will provide $8M total worth of liquidity support\ndApps leveraging Layerzero and Stargate will be supported based on the [Meter Developer Incentive Program](https://docs.meter.io/developer-documentation/meter-developer-incentives)\nMeter team will also work closely with the Stargate team on various marketing activities to maximize the exposure and activities for both Stargate’s launch and continued success on the Meter network. \nSummary\nMeter and Stargate carry similar vision of a multichain fully connected blockchain Ineternet future.  This proposal will bring better user experience to Meter and more transaction volume and TVL for both Stargate and Meter.  Meter team is also working new multichain products like Sumer.money that leverages both Layerzero and Stargate.  It will become the begining of the official collaborations between the two teams.\nUseful Links\nMeter Website:https://meter.io/\nMeter Twitter:https://twitter.com/Meter_IO\nMeter Docs:https://docs.meter.io/",

      "content": "Background\nStargate's DAO governance is considering altering Stargate Gold allocation rate, a newly approved function where 1% of bridge volume fees are converted to $gSTG. $gSTG has the potential to increase bridge transaction volume and reward holders, but will $STG face market cap reduction if a derivative token supply is increased, or will the increase in bridge volume contribute to greater value for users. \n\n- Proposal\nIncrease $gSTG from 1% of bridge volume fees to 2% bridge volume to further incentive bridge usage and reward the STG community. Maintain $gSTG biannual rewards distribution timeline to incentive bridge prioritization and bolster market sentiment. Currently, for every $1M of bridge volume, $10,000 will be allocated to the $sGOLD treasury. This proposal is suggesting to contribute $20,000 to $gSTG for every $1M of bridge volume, which will later be distributed to bridge users based on wallet activity. A majority vote of 51% or greater is required for the protocol to implement this new addition. \n\n- What is $gSTG and when is the first distribution?\nStargate DAO has voted to implement $gSTG rewards for the first distribution which is live for users from December 1, 2023 to December 15, 2023. Each $STG holder is eligibility if their wallet is older than 7 days and they have made a txn with $STG. $gSTG distribution rate will be based on wallet solvency levels and bridge volume. \n\nIf you haven't already, check [HERE](https://stargate-dao.org) if you are eligibility for the Phase 1 $gSTG Rewards Distribution. \n\n- Execution\nIf this proposal receives a majority vote of 51% of greater, $gSTG treasury allocation rate will be increase from 1% to 2% to further reward bridge users and hopefully increase overall bridge volume. \n\nIf the new rewards allocation rate is accepted it will be implement in the 2024 Q1 distribution. \n\nDon't forget to check if you are eligible for the Phase 1 $gSTG distribution if you have been an active $STG trader and bridge user.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidsg7pladqcmiodqi4bv6ch3irlz6s5ankj6we4gu2zuamo77u3sq)",

We strive to maximize returns by auto-compounding rewards into additional yield-generating opportunities. Our innovative vault factory allows anyone to deploy an auto-compounding vault specific to any Velodrome V2 liquidity pool. In the recent past, Yearn has been an active participant in the Optimism ecosystem, providing OP incentives to selected vaults.\n\n-Proposal\nTo scale up and drive further activity in the Velodrome STG-USDC.e pool, the following plan is proposed: Stargate commits to depositing a minimum of $3M of protocol-owned liquidity (POL). For every $1M of total value locked (TVL) in the pool, Yearn commits to providing 500 OP tokens weekly. This incentive plan will be active for 26 weeks.\n\n-Vault address: https://yearn.fi/vaults/10/0xf6B272134A193Df5b04332e73184E5b40b8EB810\n\n-Execution\nOnce this proposal is approved, for every $1M of TVL in the Velodrome STG-USDC.e pool, Yearn will provide 500 OP tokens. OP boost will be calculated at the beginning of each week. Concurrently, Stargate will ensure that a minimum of $3M of their STG-USDC protocol-owned liquidity is deposited into the Yearn vault on Optimism. Yearn will also ensure the total yield (compounding + yvOP emission) is at least 15% superior to staking in the velodrome pool only, so long as Stargate keeps voting for that pool.",

      "title": "PancakeSwap veCAKE Proposa",
      "content": "-Summary-\nTo boost liquidity, reduce slippage, and increase volumes for STG-TOKEN pairs on PancakeSwap, PancakeSwap is requesting Stargate DAO to lock up the DAO’s existing holdings of ~82,000 CAKE as veCAKE for 4 years. This stash of veCAKE will be used to vote for STG-TOKEN gauges on PancakeSwap every 2 weeks, starting with the STG-USDC (0.25%) gauge on Ethereum PancakeSwap.\n\n-Background-\nPancakeSwap is launching a new veCAKE gauge system, similar to Curve’s veCRV and Balancer’s veBAL. Users can lock up CAKE for a maximum of 4 years, and then vote for gauges on PancakeSwap every 2 weeks. \nBased on the amount of vote each gauge receives, the respective liquidity pair (e.g. STG-USDC) will receive a pro-rata amount of CAKE emission. This CAKE emission is used to attract users to deepen liquidity for the specific pair, reducing slippage and encouraging higher trading volumes for that pair.\nStargate DAO currently has ~$5.8M of STG-USDC protocol-owned liquidity (POL) on Ethereum PancakeSwap. The POL has seen extremely effective utilization, with APRs currently at 17% based on CAKE incentives and liquidity provider fees.\n\nBy voting for this gauge (and other STG-TOKEN gauges in the future) with veCAKE regularly, the DAO can further deepen their liquidity on this highly effective trading venue. \n\n-Proposal-\na) Grant amount: PancakeSwap is requesting Stargate DAO to lock up 100% of the DAO’s existing CAKE holdings, of roughly ~82,000 CAKE at the time of posting, as veCAKE for 4 years. Stargate’s multisig currently has ~82,000 CAKE accrued from yield farming. Note: Due to the potential time difference between the posting and execution of this proposal, the final amount of CAKE locked up may be greater than 82,000 CAKE.\n\nb) Use of grant: Stargate DAO will use the veCAKE to vote for the STG-USDC (0.25%) gauge on Ethereum PancakeSwap every two weeks. As PancakeSwap’s gauge system is multichain, it is possible to vote for STG-TOKEN gauges on other chain deployments as well.\n\nc) Re-lock mechanism: To ensure the voting power remains high, Stargate DAO commits to re-lock the entire CAKE amount, including CAKE earned from emissions, regularly for 4 years. The community may enact another proposal if they wish to stop the re-lock process. \nExecution\n\nIf the proposal is successful, the Stargate team will lock all CAKE earned from yield farming (~82,000 at time of proposal) for 4 years as veCAKE. Once the veCAKE gauge system is live, Stargate will vote for the STG-USDC (0.25%) gauge on Ethereum PancakeSwap every 2 weeks and re-lock all CAKE (the original amount + new CAKE earned from emissions) for 4 years regularly.\nIf the Stargate DAO enacts to seed liquidity for other STG-TOKEN pairs on PancakeSwap in the future, the Stargate team can direct all or some of the veCAKE voting power towards those gauges as well.\n\n-Success-\nIf successful, this proposal will result in a sustainable APR paid to Stargate DAO for hosting liquidity on PancakeSwap, enabling the DAO to further reap benefits from the deployment of its POL on a highly effective trading venue.",

      "title": "Stargate Deployment On Meter",
      "content": "### Background \nMeter.io had been working with Layerzero team to enable Layerzero endpoint from Meter to multiple blockchains.  Today Layerzero is one of the top transaction generating applications on Meter mainnet.  In this proposal we are aiming to deploy Stargate on Meter mainnet to allow on/off major crypto assets from multiple blockchains to Meter and bring more activities to Stargate.\n\n### About Meter.io\nMeter is a high performance blockchain built on hybrid PoS/PoW and HotStuff consensus.  It is Ethereum compatible, highly decentralized (currently 337 consensus nodes, scalable to thousands) with unique features like MEV/front running resistant, instant finality and a PoW created flatcoin for payments and transaction fees.  Meter has a unique feature lists that is taylor made for decentralized financial applications:\n\n1. Censorship resistant.  Meter’s highly decentralized consensus ensures the network is highly decentralized and robust.  Transactions will be processed smoothly even the network is under attacks.\n2. High throughput and instant finality designed for trading.  Meter is not only capable of processing thousand of transaction per second but also each ensuring each transaction in the blockchain is finalized with no possibility of rollbacks.  \n3. Fair transaction ordering.  Each year, blockchain users lost billions of dollars due to MEV and front running attacks when they use Ethereum, L2 and other blockchains.  Meter is the only blockchain that is built from ground up to be MEV/front running resistant.  Users will enjoy the safe and smooth trading environment provided by Meter.\n4. Fully decentralized flatcoin to build the future DeFi stack and ensure transaction costs both low and stable.  Meter has a dual token design, governance token MTRG used for PoS and security and gas token MTR created by PoW and used for paying transactions fees and bidding newly emitted MTRG.  Creating one MTR requires 10kwh of electricity burnt on mainstream Bitcoin miners.  Such design creates an economic equilibrium for MTR and made it the only non collateralized flatcoin that maintains its value over the past 3 years since its launch.  MTR is aim to complete Satoshi’s original vision of a sound money that is independent of the fiat system.\n\nCurrently Meter has a healthy ecosystem including DEX, lending, synthetic assets, liquid staking and games.  The existing bridge only supports USDC, USDT and ETH transfers between Ethereum and the Meter mainnet. The goal of this proposal is to improve the users experience by allowing them to on/off ramp Meter from multiple blockchains.\n### Proposal\nWe propose to launch Stargate on the Meter mainnet with the support of the following endpoints:\n- USDT (Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, BNB Chain, Base and Meter)\n- USDC (Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, BNB Chain, Base and Meter)\n- ETH(Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Base and Meter)\nUser incentives and application supports:\n- Pools deployed on Meter should receive STG emission based on SIP#23\n- The TVL incentive on the Stargate USDT & ETH LP pool is expected to receive Meter’s network token MTRG as rewards based on the [Meter TVL Incentive Program](https://docs.meter.io/developer-documentation/meter-developer-incentives/meter-tvl-incentive-program)\n- Meter community will provide liquidity pool support up to 4M USDx and 2K ETH\n- dApps leveraging Layerzero and Stargate will be supported based on the [Meter Developer Incentive Program](https://docs.meter.io/developer-documentation/meter-developer-incentives)\n\nMeter team will also work closely with the Stargate team on various marketing activities to maximize the exposure and activities for both Stargate’s launch and continued success on the Meter network. \n\n### Summary\nMeter and Stargate carry similar vision of a multichain fully connected blockchain Ineternet future.  This proposal will bring better user experience to Meter and more transaction volume and TVL for both Stargate and Meter.  Meter team is also working new multichain products like Sumer.money that leverages both Layerzero and Stargate.  It will become the begining of the official collaborations between the two teams.     \n\n### Useful Links\nMeter Website:https://meter.io/\nMeter Twitter:https://twitter.com/Meter_IO\nMeter Docs:https://docs.meter.io/",

Binance has also confirmed to cease BUSD support by Feb 2024. Stargate should act on this sooner than later.\n\nProposal\nThis proposal is to\n-Shut down BNB BUSD pool and associated pathways\n-Swap all BUSD multisig holdings into another highly liquid, USD-pegged stablecoin\n\nExecution\nThis proposal can be implemented immediately with minimal technical resources. \n\nUpon proposal passing\n-Set BNB Chain BUSD pool into withdrawal only mode on Stargate UI\n-Notify community of intent to wind down pool and encourage LP withdrawal before Oct 30th\n-Stargate Protocol Funds (held in Multisig): Swap all BUSD on BNB Chain into another highly liquid USD-pegged stablecoin\n-PancakeSwap LP: Exit current position, swap all BUSD into another highly liquid USD-pegged stablecoin, and re-enter with STG-(USD-pegged stablecoin) pairing.\n\n1 week after passing\n-Set BNB Chain BUSD pool emissions, and associated pathway weights, to 0.\n-Stargate should withdraw any BUSD POL, and swap for another USD-pegged stablecoin.\n\n2 weeks after passing\n-Send notification to all BUSD pool farmers to unstake before/on Oct 30th\n\nSummary\nThis proposes to remove all BUSD from Stargate by Oct 30th 2023 (or 2 weeks after passing) in response to Binance’s plan to cease redemption support by Feb 2024. This includes both the BUSD pool on Stargate, as well as any holdings in the Stargate multisig (LP or wallet positions).",

      "title": "Proposal to Approve Stargate Deployment on Scroll",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nScroll is an L2 Scaling solution that is pushing the development of an Ethereum-equivalent zkEVM. Scroll is launching Mainnet in Q3 and has been live and battle tested on Goerli since February this year.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to improve the user experience on Scroll by having Stargate deployed to offer users the ability to transfer assets onto (and out of) Scroll.\n\n**About Scroll**\n\n[Scroll](https://scroll.io/) is a bytecode-equivalent ZK-Rollup built upon Ethereum, designed for scaling without sacrificing security, developer, or user experience:\n\n-   **Bytecode Equivalence & Developer Friendliness**: Scroll is bytecode-equivalent and builds upon Geth, enabling seamless migration of infrastructure and will support all existing development tools, including debuggers. Scroll has one of the most familiar developer experiences outside Ethereum itself. No bytecode re-audits will be required, minimizing the risk surface tremendously.\n-   **Ethereum-native & Community first**: Scroll originated in close collaboration with the Ethereum Foundation's zkEVM research within the [PSE (Privacy and Scaling Explorations) group](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations)---in fact, our team has contributed ~50% of the upstream PSE zkEVM codebase over the past 2 years. Scroll has been open source & peer reviewed since day one, our testnet has been permissionless since its inception, and we continuously [publish](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1585145691311329280?s=20&t=v8fXgqmJV_M1gmDRNEj7GA) [research](https://twitter.com/leonardoalt/status/1614189758774665221?s=20&t=ZbiCsoXsUW-XxnhDwm9qwQ) in an effort to demystify the inner works of [zk circuits and cryptography](http://scroll.io/blog).\n-   **Decentralization & Security**: Scroll is pioneering a first-of-its-kind decentralized sequencer network and is committed to outsource proof generation. In addition to that, Scroll has a strong in-house security team that found and reported bugs in fellow zk RU's proving systems in the past.\n\nZK-Rollups are widely considered to be the Holy Grail of Ethereum scaling. Scroll's vision is to build a fully EVM-compatible ZK-Rollup that any existing Ethereum application can easily migrate to. Scroll is currently live on Goerli Testnet today and is expected to launch on Mainnet in Q3. Testnet transactions can be observed on: <https://blockscout.scroll.io/>\n\n**Proposal**\n\nWe propose for Stargate to launch on Scroll as early as possible pending our Mainnet Launch. We are also working with the LayerZero team to ensure an LZ endpoint will be deployed on Scroll following our launch.\n\nWe propose the following Stargate pools/pathways to be enabled on launch:\n\n-   ETH: Ethereum <> Scroll\n-   USDC: Ethereum <> Scroll\n\nThis will allow Stargate to capture user growth in the Scroll ecosystem while providing developers and users with crucial bridging infrastructure.\n\nTo bootstrap liquidity for the proposed pools, our contributors will deploy up to 1K ETH and 1M USD, respectively.\n\nThis will help ensure that enough liquidity is present at launch for users to transfer ETH & USDC.\n\n**Execution**\n\nIf approved, Stargate will launch on Scroll shortly after our Mainnet launch in Q3, pending the deployment of LayerZero endpoints to Scroll.\n\nThe ETH and USDC pools/pathways are to be enabled with the deployment of Stargate on Scroll.\n\nPool incentives are to be determined by Stargate's governance as a function of pool utilization per [SIP 23](https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x7839f919ddd2c226ef0f050ce9250b0f1f41c1d94bf0ab8fdc9205b151fe3a2a).\n\n**Summary**\n\nScroll is launching Mainnet in Q3 and the aim is to have Stargate as an early protocol launch partner, providing a win-win opportunity for both Stargate as a potential bridge leader in Scroll's ecosystem and users with the ability to bridge assets in and out of Scroll.",

Today, Google Cloud launched an oracle on LayerZero, making a compelling offering from one of the largest organizations in the world available to anyone building on top of LayerZero. \n\n-Proposal-\nStargate should adopt The Google Cloud Oracle for all of its products (Stargate and TheAptosBridge). This will provide security backed by Google Cloud to Stargate, allowing it to take full advantage of the latest high profile oracle to become live on LayerZero. This will bolster confidence in Stargate, opening the door for even more protocols to build on top of the most used bridge in crypto.\n\n-Execution-\nStargate will update its configuration to adopt the Google Cloud oracle on all chains where it is available for all Stargate products. For any chains where the oracle is not available, Stargate should remain on the current configuration and then migrate to The Google Cloud Oracle if it becomes available. \n\n-Summary-\nStargate stands to align itself with a titan of web2 by selecting the Google Cloud oracle in its configuration. Doing so should only increase confidence in Stargate and help bolster confidence in the market for Stargate's products.",

      "title": "Stargate Foundation 12-month Budget Proposal",
      "content": "**Issue Statement**\n\nStargate Finance has grown exponentially in 2023 hitting major protocol milestones, including over $3.4B in monthly transaction volume and over $2M in monthly protocol fees generated.\n\nWhile Stargate is a decentralized protocol supported by the DAO.  The Stargate Foundation executes certain operations upon the will of the DAO. This support necessitates a budgeting and administration of expenses. With the protocol growing significantly in terms of community, use, partnerships and development, the Foundation should have a budget to support the DAO. The level of support needed has grown such that the Foundation requires dedicated resource allocation, as will be detailed below.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThis proposal is for a 12-month budget (September 2023 - August 2024) based on an estimation of costs required by the Foundation to continue supporting the DAO in the following functional areas:\n\n***Dedicated Support***\n\n* Foundation requires a small team of people dedicated to operating within the Foundation and executing upon the will of the DAO. This includes functions such as, but not limited to, the following;\n    - BD and Partnerships - e.g. supporting protocols that build of top of Stargate, liaising with chains that get approved for Stargate deployments\n    - Community and Marketing - e.g. coordinating launch announcements to Stargate’s >650,000 person audience, planning/coordinating community calls\n    - Strategy and Analytics - e.g. analysing Stargate’s progress to self-sufficiency, efficiency of the rebalancing fee/reward design\n    - Other areas that present in future\n\n***Technical Support (including audits)***\n\n* The Protocol requires continual technical support to execute upon proposals mandated by the DAO, for example:\n    - Configuring new chain/pool deployments\n    - Data driven emissions mandate\n\n* Stargate is also security-first and new contracts should continue to be heavily audited\n* Foundation will continue to liaise with technical execution partners as and when needed\n\n***Legal***\n\n* Corporate service, registered agent and general counseling fees across jurisdictions\n\n***Marketing***\n\n* Stargate should perform some marketing function, supported by the Foundation, for example:\n    - Events at conferences\n    - Educational campaigns with teams like Galxe, Layer3, etc\n\n***Other Operating Expenses***\n\n* Recurring expenses for day-to-day operations (e.g Moderators, web hosting, email services, payment processing, Discord bots, other toolkits)\n\nThe operational funding will be transferred from the Protocol Multisigs to the designated Foundation Multisig wallet for ease of use and expenditure. An additional Operations wallet may be used for ease of payments. \n\n**Execution**\n\nTo obtain the funds, it is suggested to withdraw $900,000 in liquidity from the Polygon USDC pool. Furthermore, upon successful completion of this proposal, $900,000 worth of STG (priced on day of completion) should be sent to the Foundation multisig.\n\nUpon successful governance vote, funds are transferred hereafter to the Foundation multisig wallet. The Stargate Foundation will be tasked with dispensing the budget according to the above framework. Below are the estimates.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreih657l4daehca3f56mya3b7juvmrwsokblacjmpfk6tllqupdw3rm)\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe Stargate Foundation does important work to support the Protocol and the mandate of the Stargate DAO. In order to continue providing support for the next 12-months, especially given the growth of the protocol and the community, the Foundation is requesting a budget of $1.8M. These funds will be transferred to the designated Foundation multisig and used for various functions including, but not limited to; dedicated support, technical support (including audits), legal, marketing and other operational expenditure.",

Currently TheAptos bridge relies on LayerZero default finality to the chain as defined by LayerZero documentation (https://layerzero.gitbook.io/docs/technical-reference/mainnet/default-config) and a waiting period of approximately three days when bridging from Aptos back to another chain. TheAptosBridge is currently free to use in all directions for users and applications.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nStargate should lower the block confirmations required to bridge from Aptos to 260 blocks (roughly 1 minute) and add a small fee of 7 basis points when returning from Aptos to other chains.\n\nOther bridges that service Aptos have significantly faster transfer times from Aptos than Stargate. This reduces TheAptosBridge’s competitiveness in market and could lead to lower overall use. Reducing the block confirmations would allow Stargate to better align TheAptosBridge with the market. Protected by PreCrime (https://medium.com/layerzero-official/introducing-pre-crime-49bef4a581d5) this will have no security implications but create a better user experience for end users that use the bridge and applications that build on top of it.\n\nStargate should add a 7 basis point fee (0.07%) to TheAptosBridge only when transferring from Aptos. Transfers to Aptos should remain free. This will discourage users from abusing the bridge as a free transfer mechanism to hop between chains (for example transferring from Arbitrum to Aptos and then from Aptos to Optimism to not have to pay fees to move between the chains). If this is not implemented and the block confirmations are reduced, chain balances for underlying assets may heavily concentrate on a few chains, diminishing the utility of TheAptosBridge for applications and users alike. Stargate is also able to generate additional fees for the protocol by implementing this proposal building protocol owned liquidity.\n\n**Execution**\n\nIf this proposal passes, Stargate should immediately reduce the block confirmations out of Aptos to 260 blocks (roughly 1 minute).\nStargate should also immediately turn on a 7 basis point fee for all outbound transfers from Aptos, to be accrued into the owning addresses (Stargate’s multisigs). These assets should be converted monthly to POL on each chain (the asset that has the highest protocol owned liquidity per chain) and used within Stargate’s liquidity pools to help boost protocol owned liquidity on each chain.\n\n**Summary**\n\nBy owning TheAptosBridge Stargate has the chance to make the bridge a better user experience and general additional fees. Stargate should reduce block confirmations from Aptos to 260 blocks (roughly 1 minute) and add a 7 basis point (0.07%) fee for these transfers. This will make TheAptosBridge more usable for applications and users while generating additional value for Stargate.",

      "title": "Renewed Liquidity Incentivization Mandate",
      "content": "--Background--\nOn May 6, 2022, Stargate DAO voted to leverage its STG holdings to incentivize liquidity. This strategy involves paying out STG to veCRV holders, CVX holders, and Redacted Cartel (https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x456c84b723da125d1a4e7b53630b280228c5f2139c40f5dbc56fd3ace5b332ef).\n\nOn May 23, 2022, Stargate DAO voted to stake its STG/USDC LP on Convex to earn rewards (https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x48b26abbc97d94910503e65f02dbbc13f60a07265e49c2986405778978a9559d). The rewards are locked to further amplify the rewards earned, producing a compounding effect.\n\nThrough this mechanism, Stargate accumulates rewards in the form of CRV and CVX. Ideally, for every $1 of STG paid, Stargate earns greater than $1 in rewards.\n\nSince then, several other proposals have passed that have diversified Stargate’s LP position into Yearn, StakeDAO, Aura Finance, BeethovenX, and most recently Velodrome. Rewards earned from these protocols are being staked and compounded in a similar fashion to Curve/Convex. As a result, Stargate is now accumulating additional assets such as yCRV, SDT, AURA, VELO, etc.\n\nOver one year has passed since the initial governance vote and the DAO should reevaluate the effectiveness of this strategy.\n\nThe ultimate goal of liquidity incentivization is to generate additional POL for the DAO. Ideally, for every $1 of liquidity incentivization Stargate should earn greater than $1 in rewards. At the time of incentivization this is often the case. However, rewards are paid out in the token of the protocol (CRV, AURA, VELO, etc.) and are then locked up to compound rewards, earn additional yield and/or provide incentives to LP. This exposes the Stargate treasury to token price risk while accumulating assets that do not actively work within the protocol to reduce the amount of liquidity required to be rented via incentivization to allow Stargate to function smoothly.\n\nThe POL benefits of this strategy is highly volatile and heavily varies on a day-to-day basis depending on the price of STG and the price of the reward tokens. At any given point in time, Stargate may be up or down millions of dollars depending on individual token prices and the value of those tokens relative to STG. Profitability also depends on how it is measured: using the current STG price, or the STG price at the time of incentivization. At various points through the incentivisation strategies, Stargate has had hundreds of thousands of dollars in unrealised profits, or losses (depending on when token prices were observed).\n\n--Proposal--\nThe current liquidity incentivization strategy exposes Stargate to unnecessary token price risk. Stargate as a protocol also does not benefit from holding these assets in the long-run, and should focus on accumulating POL that contributes to reducing the need for rented liquidity.\n\nInstead of accumulating and compounding all rewards earned from liquidity incentivization, Stargate should periodically swap these rewards. Stargate should at current point sell all of it’s accumulated and unlocked rewards for ETH, where the mandate allows for it. Not only does this reduce token price risk, but also accumulates useful POL for the protocol, further reducing STG emissions paid out to LPs. As Stargate seeks to launch on various new L2s in the near future, accumulating ETH POL should also be a priority to enable ETH swaps between L2s without needing to incentivise as much liquidity.\n\nHenceforth, Stargate should swap any accumulated rewards on a monthly basis into ETH, as the mandates allow for it. Should ETH not be available natively on the chain in question, stablecoins should be the accumulation priority.\n\nThis proposal also recommends that Stargate continue to allow up to $10M worth of STG per annum to be used for incentivisation, on the condition that a return of 1.5X ($1.50 for every $1 spent) can be achieved with any such strategy.\n\n-Exceptions below-\nStargate has (at time of writing) $660k worth of locked $AURA tokens. Upon unlocking in November 2023, Stargate should aim to keep ~$500k worth of $AURA so as to maintain significant voting power to incentivise rewards to be directed to the STG-stables pool.\n\nIn a case where selling such a position would result in greater than -1.0% market impact, the position should be split into tranches over a suitable amount of days, such as to minimise the market impact.\n\nStargate currently holds various locked positions (e.g. SDT, VELO) where it should continue to hold these positions and by mandate may accumulate future long-term locked positions.\n\n--Summary--\nThe profitability of Stargate DAO’s current liquidity incentivization program is highly volatile and subjects the DAO to large token price risk as it accumulates reward tokens (CRV, AURA, etc.). At this point, Stargate should swap the currently accumulated rewards into ETH so as to accumulate ETH help in POL, reducing the need for STG emissions, and reducing token price risk. Going forward, Stargate should do so on a monthly basis.",

The platform combines the speed and efficiency of traditional trading systems with the transparency and security of blockchain settlement to create an unparalleled trading experience. The design provides users with instant execution, millisecond latency, and gas-free settlement, all while allowing them to maintain full control and custody of funds.\n\nIn the next few months, IDEX will launch their perpetual futures platform on top of XCHAIN, an IDEX specific zkEVM L2 and the first of Polygon’s zkEVM supernets. XCHAIN brings the scalability and affordability necessary for an order book perpetual futures DEX to truly compete with centralized exchanges.\n\nKey benefits of XCHAIN:\n-Gas-free trade settlement\n-Deposits and settlement secured by Ethereum\n-Opportunity for additional dApps to serve IDEX users & capital\n-Seamless integration and liquidity with Polygon 2.0 ecosystem\n\nIDEX perpetuals are collateralized by USDC bridged and minted on XCHAIN via the L1 native bridge.\n\n--Proposal--\nIDEX proposes for Stargate to launch on XCHAIN, working with LayerZero to set up an endpoint on XCHAIN mainnet. IDEX is requesting to deploy a USDC pool on XCHAIN, with pathways to and from Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.\n-IDEX will provide a two-year grant of a guaranteed $500k (~10M IDEX tokens) to incentivize liquidity\n-Stargate will be the exclusive bridge partner for XCHAIN, capturing all L2 <> XCHAIN and fast L1 <> XCHAIN bridge volume\n-Stargate will be integrated directly into the IDEX application, with the bridge acting as the default, white labeled method for users to move in and out of XCHAIN.\n\nUtilizing Stargate’s bridge and call mechanism will allow users to deposit bridged funds directly into the smart contracts, a seamless UX that ensures the majority of volume in and out of XCHAIN flows through Stargate, and, in the process, highlights LayerZero’s innovation in cross-chain messaging.\n\nAdditionally, Stargate and LayerZero will unlock cross-chain composability and serve as the foundation for expanding the availability of defi services to IDEX customers. Swap DEXs, lending platforms, and other defi primitives on connected networks will be integrated into IDEX, allowing users to access these products directly from XCHAIN and boosting Stargate usage and volume in the process. We see Stargate and LayerZero as critical components to expand the products available to IDEX users while we continue to focus the majority of our development efforts on the perpetual futures protocol.\n\n--Integration--\n-Add LayerZero endpoints to XCHAIN mainnet\n-Deploy Stargate on XCHAIN and enable USDC pathways to and from Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon\n-IDEX integrates Stargate seamlessly into the deposit/withdrawal workflow as the exclusive, white labeled bridge provider (DONE - pending testnet deployment)\n-IDEX provides $500k of IDEX token incentives to jump start liquidity\n\n--Summary--\nIDEX and XCHAIN are the forefront of the next wave of app-specific networks and represent an inflection point in the importance of cross-chain messaging and bridge protocols. An exclusive integration between XCHAIN and Stargate will allow Stargate to capture all of the bridge volume for the network and continue to position itself as the leading cross-chain liquidity solution.",

      "content": "-Background-\nOn the 6th of July 2023, cross-chain bridge protocol Multichain was compromised, entailing the unauthorized withdrawal of $125M of various assets to an unknown address. Among the assets withdrawn were 9,674,426 WOO tokens that were thitherto being used to back the equivalent number of WOO tokens issued by Multichain protocol in the Fantom ecosystem 1:1.\n\nTo contain the risk of these unbacked WOO tokens within the Fantom ecosystem, WOO liquidity was shortly removed from Stargate’s pools on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism. Instead, an alternative solution was implemented that enables all affected users to swap their unbacked WOO tokens out of Fantom to other blockchains via a service provided by WOO Network’s centralized exchange, WOO X.\n\n-Proposal-\nBefore the removal of WOO liquidity from Stargate Bridge, the WOO token was one of the most bridged assets behind blue chips like ETH and stablecoins. This proposal kindly asks that Stargate DAO deprecate the WOO liquidity pool on Fantom now that efforts are being taken to wind down the WOO token in the Fantom ecosystem. Provided the Stargate DAO should agree to this, WOO Network will redeposit WOO token liquidity to six of Stargate’s chains (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism), reinstating a consistent and sizable source of fee generation for the Stargate DAO. \n\nThe return of WOO liquidity to the Stargate Bridge will also be beneficial to WOOFi - the first DEX to integrate with Stargate Bridge to power one-click cross-chain swaps. While WOO token liquidity is absent, WOOFi cross-chain swaps can only route through Stargate’s ETH and stablecoin pools, hampering their ability to find the optimal path and best execution for WOOFi users.\n\n-Execution-\n-WOO Network to remove all WOO liquidity in Stargate on Fantom\n-Stargate to deprecate the WOO pool and remove the option for users to bridge WOO tokens into or out of Fantom\n-WOO Network to add back WOO token liquidity on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism\n\n-Summary-\nAs part of efforts to wind down the WOO token in the Fantom ecosystem following the incident with Multichain protocol, we beseech the Stargate DAO to deprecate the WOO liquidity pool on Fantom. This will enable WOO Network to re-deposit WOO liquidity on six of Stargate’s chains and bring back what was a consistent source of bridging volume and fees for the Stargate DAO. In the event that WOO Network decides to revive WOO token on Fantom in the future, LayerZero bridge will be our first choice.",

      "title": "Make Aura and Balancer the STG Liquidity Hub on Arbitrum",
      "content": "-Background-\nCurrently, Stargate has protocol-owned liquidity in Arbitrum on a 50/50 STG/USDC.e Balancer Pool, with a TVL of more than $1.5M.The pool facilitates STG swaps and earns trading fees. However, the current pool's yield is not optimized because it only benefits from swap fees.\n\nStargate already has protocol-owned liquidity on mainnet within Aura Finance in a 50/50 STG/bb-a-USD pool.\n\n-Proposal-\nAura Finance is a meta-governance protocol built on top of Balancer. Aura Finance has topped over $700M in TVL on mainnet and has a massive ecosystem of partners that encompasses everything from major lending markets like Aave, to cross-chain infrastructure providers like Stargate, to top LSD providers like Rocketpool and Swell. In total, Aura has obtained and maintained fruitful relationships with over 40 different protocols within DeFi. Based on its success on mainnet, Aura contributors believe in Balancer’s potential to be a first-choice for protocols considering to either seed or grow liquidity. \n\nAura helps to amplify the effectiveness and growth of Balancer in addition to the protocols within the ecosystem. Aura’s voting incentive markets are one of the most diverse in DeFi, with over 20-30 active participants on any given round. Moreover, Aura has maintained a solid track record in the accumulation of governance influence for veBAL, which has helped to keep markets lively.\n\nWe propose the POL migration from the 50/50 STG/USDC.e pool to an 50/50 STG/Boosted Aave V3 USD pool staked within Aura, leveraging the current pool/gauge already available in Balancer and approved by BIP 258. Boosted pools included pools in which a portion of the liquidity, which is normally idle and not used for trading, is deposited into protocols like Aave to earn further yield. The change will help to optimize the yield-earned on this pool by generating the following benefits:\n-Make this pool more attractive for market participants due to increase of base yield through Aave lending fees;\n-Enhanced yield generation if the BPT token is staked on Aura; and\n-Lower cost of the voting incentives;\n\nThe ability to replace the current pool with a boosted one means an increase of the base yield thanks to the Aave lending fees. This can attract further liquidity, thus guaranteeing for the pool to be a focal point in the liquidity provisioning of Stargate in Arbitrum. Furthermore, the possibility to stake the POL in Aura will help to increase Stargate's influence within the Balancer ecosystem, which can be later used to support cost-effective STG liquidity and reduce protocol expenses.\n\nLiquidity Providers improve their returns when staking the BPT token in Aura, because the APR is boosted by Aura emissions. This can incentivize third party liquidity providers within the Stargate community.\n\nAs the goal is for this boosted pool to be the major liquidity source for STG in Arbitrum, improving the base yield is a sensitive approach. The STG/bb-a-USD boosted pool that is the subject of this proposal has limited liquidity, so it does not promote current swaps or reflect any swap fee APR at this time, though it has boosted APR of 1.22%. These figures are also subject to fluctuation over time. If this proposal passes and we assume the current 1.61% swap fee APR of the existing 50/50 STG/USDC.e pool carries over, the boosted pool and the POL, if deposited, would generate 1.61% in swap fee APR, thus increasing the boosted pool's APR by 1.22% to 2.83%. Because the boosted STG/bb-a-USD pool has swap fees currently set to 1% compared to the lower 0.3% for the 50/50 STG/USDC.e pool, it's likely that the boosted version would provide increased swap fee APR and even more aggregate yield than 2.83%.\n\nWith the ability, in future, to further increase the yield of this pool through Aura incentive markets, the STG/Boosted Aave V3 USD pool will provide not only a base superior yield compared to the current solution, but also the flexibility to further grow liquidity in future if desired.\n\nOne further advantage of this proposal is that it will greatly benefit the Stargate protocol by enabling them to passively acquire more BAL/AURA tokens, thereby enhancing liquidity provisioning. As stated previously, Stargate already has a strategic position of not only protocol-owned liquidity but also AURA on mainnet. The proposed strategic integration will gradually make the process more cost-effective over time, ensuring Stargate's ability to grow their protocol while leveraging their assets across any chain in which the Balancer ecosystem is either already present or currently deploying. In this sense, the recent expansion of Aura protocol on several L2 (Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and soon Gnosis), will play a key role.\n\n-Execution-\n$1.5M+ of POL will be moved from the current 50/50 pool to the already available Balancer 50/50 STG/Boosted Aave V3 USD pool on Abritrum, staked in Aura.",

      "content": "Background\nBeefy is a multi-chain yield optimizer present on 21 different blockchains (8 of which are shared with Stargate). Currently offering more than 650 vaults that compound rewards generated by almost $250M TVL. Beefy has many strong traits, two of the most outstanding ones are a big focus on security, and great user experience.\nBeefy is a recipient of a Grant from the Optimism Governance Fund. One of the purposes of the grant is to showcase Optimism protocols to our multichain user base.\n\nProposal\nThis proposal aims to allocate Beefy’s $OP tokens to boost the STG-USDC Velodrome autocompouding vault, with the goal of attracting more $STG liquidity and tokenholders on Optimism. We will introduce the boost along with some marketing and educational pieces, which will aim to increase awareness and understanding of Stargate’ s protocol and $STG token among Beefy users. As a result of the boost, the users will earn more $STG tokens, as the liquidity incentives from Velodrome are swapped into more $STG and redeposited, plus an extra APR in the form of $OP tokens for staking into the boost.\n\nBeefy’s proposal is to allocate 12,500 $OP tokens to be distributed in the STG-USDC Vault. Beefy will also create the educational and marketing pieces about Stargate, and our development team will create and manage the contracts related to the boost. In return, we are asking for Stargate to stake $3M of STG-USDC as protocol-owned liquidity into the autocompounding Beefy vault, (and not into the boost). This will allow the $OP rewards tol be distributed amongst more users.\n\nExecution\n12,500 OP will be allocated to be distributed over 2 to 4 weeks into all users who stake into the boost. The boost would start on 22 July, and the marketing/educational pieces will be released during the boost period to maximize attention.\n\n$3M of STG-USDC POL will be provided into the Beefy vault on Optimism before 22 July.",

On July 6, 2023, LayerZero introducted several new assets into the Fantom ecosystem including their version of USDC (\nhttps://ftmscan.com/address/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48).\n\nProposal\nStargate should re-enable support for the Fantom chain by creating pools using the USDC token (https://ftmscan.com/address/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48). This would allow Stargate to once again support Fantom and provide the protocol with a way to use safe and trusted assets to do so.\n\nDoing this would allow Stargate to capture transfer volume to and from Fantom, accruing more value to protocol owned liquidity from fees earned during these transfers.\n\nExecution\nStargate would open a LayerZero USDC pool on Fantom. To do so, contracts should be deployed to support this pool and emissions should be enabled for them to incentivize needed liquidity to join it allowing Stargate users to transfer assets to and from Fantom. This pool should be connected to every other USDC, BUSD and USDT pool on Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Polygon, and BNB Chain.\nStargate should target a $10,000,000 dollar TVL for the first month with STG distributed at a 5% APR. After its introduction the pools target TVL and emissions should follow Stargate’s current mandate for such actions.\n\nSummary\nStargate should re-enable support for the Fantom ecosystem by opening new pools of the USDC (https://ftmscan.com/address/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48) asset introduced recently by LayerZero.

      "title": "Stargate Deployment On Kava",
      "content": "Background \nThe Kava Network is a Layer-1 blockchain that combines the speed and scalability of the Cosmos SDK with the developer support of Ethereum. The Kava Network will empower developers to build for Web3 and next-gen blockchain technologies through its unique co-chain architecture. KAVA is the native governance and staking token of the Kava Network, enabling its decentralization and security. \n\nKava network enables seamless interoperability between the Ethereum and Cosmos Co-Chains empowering developers to build in whichever environment they want without sacrificing access to the users and assets of the other. Kava’s lightning-fast Tendermint Core consensus engine enables the free flow of users, assets, and projects between Kava and the industry’s most relevant ecosystems at scale. The Kava network also stands as the only blockchain with a native issuance of USDT that seamlessly connects to the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nKava network also features an innovative and transparent on-chain incentive program, Kava Rise, to ensure that the best builders in the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems are properly rewarded for driving growth to the Kava Network.\n\nProposal\nThe Kava Origin Foundation proposes for Stargate to launch on Kava now that there is the LayerZero endpoint on Kava mainnet. To start, the Foundation would like to request one pool: USDT (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain and Avalanche)\n\nTo incentivize this launch and campaign, the Kava Origin Foundation proposes a 2 year grant distributed as: Guaranteed 500,000 KAVA over next two years distributed monthly and in addition to Kava Rise which is an innovative and transparent on-chain incentive program for developers driving adoption to the Kava Network.50,000 KAVA upfront as kickoff grant which is in addition to rewards above and can be used discretionarily.\n\nAnticipated 25,000 KAVA per month in rewards from Abracadabra KAVA incentives on Stargate USDT LP pools.\n\nKava aims to conduct a robust marketing campaign to maximize the benefits of Stargate's successful cross-chain and interconnectivity mission. By highlighting Stargate's revolutionary features, we aim to showcase the immense value it brings to Kava and the entire blockchain ecosystem. By leveraging Stargate's powerful features, Kava enables seamless capital movement, empowering businesses and individuals to thrive in a dynamic and interconnected digital economy.\n\nThrough the integration of Kava into Stargate, a plethora of revenue streams and gateways are unlocked for the Stargate DAO, previously inaccessible due to the lack of a connection between Stargate and the Cosmos ecosystem. A notable area of interest is our esteemed Kava Rise program, which rewards builders with $750 million in transparent on-chain incentives for their invaluable contributions in driving activity and generating value. The prospect of building on LayerZero and Stargate has sparked great enthusiasm among Kava developers, promising to amplify value, utilization, and synergy within the DAO. Ultimately, this integration will foster a thriving ecosystem, channeling increased numbers of users and value back to the DAO.\n\nSuccess Measures\nStargate Protocol enables USDT transfers between Kava, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain and Avalanche. This integration opens up new access points for value transfer, creating additional opportunities to capture fees for the Protocol. As a result, users can enjoy enhanced flexibility and efficiency when transferring USDT across these blockchain networks and also enable the Stargate protocol can tap into untapped potential within the cosmos ecosystem, unlocking previously inaccessible avenues of growth and value.\n\nKava Origin Foundation provides a 2-year grant incentivizing liquidity, as well as providing Stargate DAO with incremental revenue through value capture from providing liquidity on these liquidity paths. \n\nSteps for Integration\nStargate deploys on Kava, enabling the USDT pool to and from Kava, Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, BNB Chain and Avalanche\nThe Kava Origin Foundation initiates a comprehensive marketing campaign aimed at showcasing the significance of Stargate on the Kava network\n\nSummary\nBy expanding to a new chain, Stargate will effectively advance its mission to become the leading omnichain liquidity layer, offering a wider range of choices and increased trading volume through its platform. This expansion will not only generate more revenue for the DAO but also solidify Stargate as an integral component of the Kava ecosystem powering seamless transfers of various tokens, including native USDT, across the vast and interconnected Cosmos network. Furthermore, it will contribute to the development of a more resilient DeFi infrastructure on Kava, enhancing the network's utility and delivering added value to its users.",

      "title": "$ARB Token Allocation",
      "content": "Issue Statement:\nAs part of the Arbitrum governance token airdrop, the Arbitrum Foundation reserved 1.13% of the ARB token supply for DAOs building applications on Arbitrum. Stargate was deemed to be eligible for an airdrop and received 1,674,013 $ARB token. As a DAO, STG holders are to determine the utilisation of the ARB airdrop. Discussion has ensued in our Community as to the utilisation of the ARB airdrop, which should culminate in formal discussion on the below proposal.\n\nBased on the criteria set forth by the Arbitrum Foundation, the Stargate DAO should in general use the ARB assets for two objectives: \n1. To effectively distribute and decentralise the governance of Arbitrum by governance process (as was intended with these tokens).\n2. To align with the Arbitrum ecosystem more generally and contribute to its success\n \nSolution:\nThe DAO could accomplish these objectives by allocating the ARB tokens toward two key initiatives - partner integrations and liquidity mining. 70% for Liquidity Mining (1,171,083 $ARB) - boosts liquidity on Arbitrum, allowing more users to bridge into the ecosystem. This also reduces emissions of STG. These will be given out per the demand based incentives (https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x7839f919ddd2c226ef0f050ce9250b0f1f41c1d94bf0ab8fdc9205b151fe3a2a) until depleted. \n30% for Partner Integrations (502,930 $ARB) - encourages and supports builders within Arbitrum. \n \nSuccess:\nSuccess of this proposal will result in the reduction of emissions of $STG on the Arbitrum pools for the period that $ARB rewards are still available. This contributes to the longevity of Stargate as a protocol.\nThis will also not only align Stargate with the ecosystem, but also effectively distribute these tokens to a wide range of users and members of the community, promoting governance decentralisation.\n\nUsing the tokens productively also ensures that other protocols will look favourably upon the Stargate DAO in any future alignment programs.\n \nExecution:\nStargate will set emissions on the current LPStaking contract to 0, and set it to withdraw only. This will turn off STG emissions while allowing people with a pending balance to still claim. Once $ARB emissions run out, this LPStaking contract will be re-enabled. A new LPStakingTime contract will be deployed that will pay out equivalent emissions in $ARB. \n\nUsers will need to remove their LP staked in the old farm contract (LPStaking) and redeposit into the new farm contract (LPStakingTime) in order to be eligible for rewards.\n \nSummary:\nStargate DAO received ~1.67M $ARB tokens during the Arbitrum airdrop. Stargate should use 70% of these to pay out liquidity incentives from a new LPStakingTime contract, to improve liquidity going into Arbitrum and reduce STG emissions. The remaining 30% of the tokens should be used for a Partner Integrations program running over 12 months.\n\nThis would not only encourage more users and align Stargate with the Arbitrum ecosystem, but also enable support for dApps building with Arbitrum. Furthermore this would reduce overall $STG emissions, which benefits the longevity of the protocol.",

      "title": "Ammendment to SIP#20 - Continued Balance and Rebalancing",
      "content": "Background\nPer SIP#20, Stargate leverages POL to rebalance pools and ensure the optimal state of Stargate. This achieved the desired results as reflected monthly transparency reporting found here: https://commonwealth.im/stargatetoken/discussions/Foundation.  With aggressive flows of digital assets between layer 2 blockchains such as Arbitrum and Optimism and Ethereum, pool rebalancing remained beneficial and should be scaled.  Due to the 7 day bridge time back, in these scenarios, a larger base of POL is required to maintain the targeted balances. \n\nProposal:\nThe POL capacity for rebalancing should be increased by USD 10m in stablecoins (to a total of USD 15m in stablecoins).  This should result in pool balances to be maintained at greater efficiency and allow additional flow of funds from L2 to L1 via Stargate. It is also expected that this would result in greater fees capture by Stargate and a larger share of balancing rewards toward POL growth.\n\nExecution:\nIn administering rebalances, Stargate Foundation could employ an additional 10,000,000 in stablecoins. Transparency reports will continue to be produced for the DAO to evaluate the effectiveness of the rebalancing.  The DAO retains the right to cancel or terminate the capacity for rebalancing at all times.\n\nSummary\nThe POL capacity for rebalancing should be increased by 10m in assets. By having a balanced system the protocol will be able to function with less TVL, warranting a future reduction of emissions and more revenue per dollar staked within the protocol.",

      "content": "Stargate eqFees are generated based upon the following math:\n  \n![download.png](ipfs://bafkreiaesadod2pxj6fdm22dfa5jwubq3yi6ijp2kbdgrz5io26km7af2m)\n    \n    \nIn lay terms, when a user transfers funds on a healthy pathway within Stargate, only the core protocol fee is charged (6-10 bps). When a user transfers funds on an already depleted pathway in a way that makes the pathway less balanced, the user is charged an additional fee as described above. This fee is then set aside into a “sidepocket” (a pool of funds separated from all other funds) which can be used to reward users who swap in a direction that balances the protocol.\n\nBased on Stargate’s design it’s not possible to know the full state of all chains at once. This problem led to the creation of the Delta Algorithm (https://www.dropbox.com/s/gf3606jedromp61/Delta-Solving.The.Bridging-Trilemma.pdf). This allows a surface where a user can add liquidity to a pool (reducing the deficit required to capture the eqReward by clearing the deficit) and then clear additional amounts of the deficit and receive a larger reward. As they do this, they can then remove the liquidity therefore bringing the protocol back to a state that is less balanced than ideal, but more balanced than prior to their actions. This was by design initially to make it such that providing liquidity doesn’t reward eqRewards.  However, as Stargate has evolved, this mechanism can now be used adversely, meaning that eqRewards are distributed in a less efficient manner only partially rebalancing the protocol rather than entirely rebalancing it. \n\nProposal\nStargate should: \n--Remove the discount given to rebalancing transfers such that they pay less protocolFee (keeping the protocolFee at 6-10 bps for all transfers)\n--Update the feelibrary such that the maximum eqReward distributed is the maximum protocol fee for the pathway (6-10 bps), meaning that users rebalancing the protocol will receive a free (0 fee) but are not paid an excess reward for doing so.\n\nThe end result of these changes would not have a material impact on Stargate’s core protocol.\n\nSummary\nBy modifying the feelibrary to only rebate fees instead of providing rewards, Stargate would remove the surface for users to capture additional eqRewards. This would allow the protocol to retain more eqRewards and incentivize continued balance within Stargate.  \n\n    ",

      "title": "Fantom Pool Windup",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nOn May 24th Multichain announced that a “force majeure'' was impacting some parts of its service (Due to a technical error with Commonwealth previews the tweet will be available at the end of this thread). This creates a lack of clarity around what is happening with Multichain and the stability of anyUSDC, Fantom’s primary USDC asset.\n\nAt launch, Stargate included anyUSDC within its pools as anyUSDC was considered by the industry to be the “native” assets for Fantom. Currently, there are 11.4 million dollars worth of deposited LP into this pool, Fantom pools are currently effectively isolated from other Stargate pools.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nStargate should disable the Fantom pools and pathways. \n\nThe technical steps for accomplishing this are:\n\n- Set STG emissions on the Fantom pools to 0\n- Disconnect the Fantom pools from every other pool\n- Remove and unwind anyUSDC POL via Multichain, Then deposit the POL into the Ethereum USDC pool.\n- Whitelist existing LPs to enable redemption of their LP out to any other chain (Throughout the voting process any LP can remove their LP and unwind their anyUSDC balance manually over Multichain, and it’s probably advisable to do so.)\n\nIn light of the disclosure by Multichain of a force majeure event risk mitigating measures should be taken. Going forward, Stargate should consider expanding bridging options for bridging options to Fantom users  in other ways, including possibly via Hydra (https://commonwealth.im/stargatetoken/discussion/10403-stargate-v2).\n\n**Summary**\n\nTo mitigate risk to  Stargate and its liquidity providers, Stargate should eliminate the Fantom USDC pool and remove all DAO controlled funds from the pool.\n\n**Notes**\n\nThe tweet referenced in \"background\":\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1661443109019062272",

      "title": "Velodrome Strategy Update",
      "content": "Background\nFollowing implementation of Stargate's incentive program on Velodrome, TVL for the STG-USDC pair has grown over $7M and currently offers a 80%+ APR. Stargate has moved its $1.5M POL on Optimism to Velodrome to capture these VELO rewards as proposed. Given the strong initial results, we believe Stargate has the opportunity to make its incentive program more capital-efficient by reducing the weekly cadence of incentives and increasing the time period of the program.\n\nProposal\nStargate will reduce weekly bribes on Velodrome from $100k to $25K in STG, therefore expanding the length of the program from 4 additional weeks to 16 weeks. It will also move an additional $1M in POL to the pool to farm and lock more of the total emissions.\nExtending the program from 4 to 16 weeks will give Stargate additional time to measure results of incentives on Velodrome, including VELO emissions, lock bonuses, and voting rewards.\n\nIf the STG-USDC pair on Velodrome continues to performs well, Stargate will additionally have the option to migrate additional POL to Optimism to add to Velodrome and receive additional VELO emissions. Stargate will be able to deploy the VELO rewards as bribes in following epochs and/or lock a portion as veVELO to significantly reduce the need for STG emissions while maintaining a robust liquidity layer on Optimism.\n\nExecution\nStargate will use the remaining $400k in STG incentive program to bribe the STG-USDC pool at a rate of $25K per week for the next 16 weeks. Velodrome will match a 15-20% of Stargate's bribes each week.\n\nOnce a voting epoch is completed on Wednesday at 23:59 UTC, VELO emissions will flow to Stargate's LP. Additionally, Stargate will lock all VELO farmed as veVELO allowing it to build a voting position that will direct additional emissions to STG pools in perpetuity, while generating fee rewards, bribe rebates, and bonuses for locking. Any rewards generated by these locks will be compounded further into veVELO.\n\nLocking veVELO will also earn additional bribe boosts as outlined here.",

      "title": "Stargate x Galxe: Optimism Ecosystem Growth Grant",
      "content": "Brief intro about Galxe:\nGalxe is the leading platform for building Web3 communities. With over 65 million registered Galxe ID users, Galxe has propelled the growth of Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum, and more than 2100 partners with reward-based loyalty programs.\n\nProtocols can leverage Web3 credentials from Galxe’s credential data network to power marketplace growth, issue Soul Bound Tokens, increase community engagement, boost ecosystem growth, and generate brand awareness as a result.\n\nGalxe is a team of growth experts that has powered the on-chain and off-chain growth of our 2100+ ecosystem partners. An organic community of over 65M+ Galxe ID users and 150K+ DAU make Galxe the go-to platform for growth and retention in Web3. In addition, Galxe has become the one and only discover-to-earn protocol for users with a variety of different ecosystems running growth and retention campaigns daily. At Galxe, we’ve integrated 15 different blockchains with NFT minting functionality that include non-evm chains such as Aptos and Solana. Stargate has a great opportunity to engage both the evm and non-evm users of Galxe to the Stargate ecosystem with the objective in mind of converting those users into long-term loyal users of Stargate. Galxe’s success has put us among the top dapps in the space. According to DappRadar, Galxe has consistently become a top 10 dapp based on unique active wallets over the course of a 30-day period.\n\nIssue Statement:\nGrowth and marketing in Web3 are difficult and many projects struggle to find ways to build their community, drive on-chain activity, and re-engage with users following their first interaction. Galxe helps you tap into the most diverse Web3 user base to find the perfect user for your protocol. We accomplish this by leveraging credentials and helping you identify your loyal users, so you can reward them accordingly. Our ecosystem of 2100+ partners and 65M+ Galxe ID users allows us to assist a variety of protocols in achieving incredible growth. This includes Optimism and the participating dapps in the Optimism Quest, such as Stargate. \n\nSolution:\nGalxe is looking to team up with Stargate to run a series of campaigns to educate users on Stargate’s Optimism ecosystem, target new user growth, and introduce Stargate’s first on-chain loyalty program on Galxe.\n\nThe quests will include touching each part of the Stargate ecosystem to make sure users are familiar with everything Stargate has to offer on Optimism including but not limited to transferring, pooling, and farming on Stargate through Optimism. Educational quests will prioritize understanding Stargate and Optimism for a better user experience. Users will consume educational content from blogs to videos. What’s exciting is that Stargate has the ability to draw users from all parts of the Galxe ecosystem that Stargate may have not had exposure to yet during the quests.\n\nStargate will grow its community and power its on-chain growth on Optimism through Galxe campaigns.\n\nGalxe’s past success in the Optimism ecosystem has made this proposed partnership feel like the perfect fit. The Optimism Quest, hosted by Galxe, drove the Optimism ecosystem to new heights, resulting in strong retention of Optimism. New user growth on Optimism increased by 47% and specifically on Stargate by 106%. Stargate’s quest asked users to bridge USDC to or from Optimism which resulted in 337,000+ NFTs being minted. Galxe and Optimism accomplished the objectives of new user growth, mass adoption, and retention. Throughout this 4 month quest, there were over 3.4M+ NFTs minted on Optimism through Galxe.\n\nGalxe recently powered a Stargate quest in the Polygon ecosystem that also achieved strong results. Out of the 26 other dapps in the quest, Stargate attracted the most users and had the most NFTs minted. Over 14,600+ NFTs were minted and over 230,000+ users visited the Stargate campaign page alone.\n\nExecution:\nGalxe will work directly with the Stargate team to asses growth goals and objectives over the course of a 4-month period. The objectives set forth by the Stargate team will guide the execution of each campaign including Galxe’s marketing initiatives. Through the quests, Galxe can put in place a realm of gamification methods like no other. This includes transferable/non-transferable NFTs, generating Stargate’s own personal NFT collection, incorporating gamified NFT minting by using our Mystery Box module, and introducing Stargate’s on-chain loyalty program on Optimism powered by Galxe and its new loyalty points feature. Participation badges and loyalty levels inside the Stargate Optimism ecosystem will be achievable throughout the Galxe campaigns. Stargate will be able to identify loyalty, shine a spotlight on their most important quests through loyalty points and reward their most loyal users accordingly. This gives the opportunity for the end user to build out their own reputation in the Stargate ecosystem through NFTs, credentials, and loyalty points. Stargate and Galxe plan to run quests for users of all different levels in the crypto ecosystem to make sure no user is left behind and there is an opportunity for the inclusion of all. Each user will receive gas fee rebates for participating in the quests essentially making the campaigns a gasless experience.\n\nTimeline and costs:\nGalxe can begin working with Stargate on campaigns and growth initiatives immediately since Optimism is already integrated into Galxe. Planning will start after the passed proposal and once objectives have been finalized between the teams. Galxe will launch a series of coordinated campaigns to support Stargate objectives and the Optimism ecosystem. The only costs to be considered will come from the marketing side as Galxe will support this initiative with custom, tailored content across all of our social channels for maximum exposure.\n\nMarketing support will include being featured on Galxe’s front page carousel, receiving retweets/announcement tweets from the Galxe main Twitter page of 750K+ followers, Discord/Telegram communication, a dedicated blog post, and an AMA. \n\nGalxe Twitter (https://twitter.com/Galxe): 750K+ (Verified)\nGalxe Discord (https://discord.com/invite/galxe): 450K+\n\nSummary:\nGalxe will leverage its expertise in propelling the growth of the Stargate Optimism ecosystem. Top-tier marketing support will be provided by Galxe and we’re expecting this quest to receive maximum engagement. This initiative can begin right away after the passing of the proposal and OP tokens will be distributed to users to reimburse them for gas costs. Additionally, OP tokens will be used in a reward pool to incentivize and reward participation based on user engagement levels in the quests.\n\nGalxe is requesting a total of 45,000 OP tokens. 10% will be used for the marketing and promotion of the campaign while the remaining 90% will be left over for the reimbursement of OP gas fees and as a rewards pool for participation.",

      "title": "Make Velodrome the STG Hub on Optimism",
      "content": "Background\nCurrently Stargate has protocol owned liquidity across each of the original seven chains it deployed on. These are Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, BNB Chain, Optimism and Arbitrum. Each liquidity pair sits in a DEX, providing liquidity to trade STG and earning fees from trades.\n\nProposal\nVelodrome is the leading DEX on Optimism and the top Ethereum Layer 2 DEX with over $300M TVL. It serves as the the primary liquidity hub for the quickly growing Optimism ecosystem, serving 2x - 3x as many protocols of comparable DEXs.\n\nVelodrome works by directing VELO emissions to liquidity pools based on votes by veVELO (vote-escrow VELO) holders. Protocols can use veVELO or voter incentives (bribes) to attract votes and emissions for their liquidity pairs. In the last voting round, bribers received $3.5 in VELO for every $1 in bribes on average.\n\nOn top of the bribe multiplier, Velodrome incentives will match at least 25% of Stargate's bribes per the \"Tour de OP\" incentive program, if Stargate moves $1.5M of POL (protocol owned liquidity) to Velodrome and bribes STG-USDC pool. Combined, the bribe multiplier and bribe match can yield a 4X+ impact on liquidity incentives for STG-USDC.\n\nThe LP will still be used and routed through all aggregators, resulting in the same execution, but an APR higher than what Stargate is getting on the current Uniswap pools will be paid.\n\nIf this pair performs well, Stargate will additionally have the option to migrate additional POL to Optimism to add to Velodrome and receive additional VELO emissions. The Velodrome team will also work to promote Stargate through their ecosystem, onboarding new users to Stargate. This aligns Stargate with a large and engaged community of DeFi users.\n\nStargate will also lock farmed $VELO rewards as veVELO to significantly reduce the need for STG emissions in the future while maintaining a robust liquidity layer on Optimism. Additionally, locking veVELO will automatically qualify Stargate for a Lock Bonus, typically worth 30%-40% of the VELO locked, paid in OP.\n\nExecution\n$1.5m of POL will be moved from the Uniswap LP pool to Velodrome on Optimism. Simultaneously, Stargate will begin test run worth $500k in STG to bribe the STG-USDC pool at a rate of $100K per week. Velodrome incentives will match at least 25% of Stargate's bribes each week.\nOnce a voting epoch is completed on Wednesday at 23:59 UTC, VELO emissions will flow to Stargate's LP. If successful, this proposal will result in a higher APR to Stargate's LP and a significant reduction of STG emissions over time.\n\nFor the purposes of the pilot, Startgate will focus on locking all VELO farmed as veVELO to build a veVELO voting position and maximize the ROI provided by \"Tour de OP Incentives. This will also earn Stargate additional bribe boosts and lock bonuses which will be compounded into more $veVELO, creating an exponential effect to early $veVELO accumulation. As that position grows, it will direct additional emissions to STG pools, generate fee rewards and bribe revenue that can also be compounded into additional $veVELO.\n\nWhile the focus during the course of this pilot will be to maximally compound rewards, once the veNFT position reaches DAO targets, the DAO can begin to repurpose fees, bribes, and emissions for other purposes. The goal being to reach a state where the DAO can bribe and sustain liquidity without needing additional $STG emissions.",

      "title": "Create a Secure UniswapV3 Oracle for STG with Arrakis PALM",
      "content": "**Summary**\nDeploy Arrakis PALM to create a secure Uniwap V3 oracle and get deep, concentrated liquidity on UniV3 STG.\n\n**Introduction to Arrakis Finance and Arrakis PALM**\nArrakis Finance is Web3's trustless market-making infrastructure protocol that enables sophisticated algorithmic strategies on Uniswap V3.\n\nSince launch, Arrakis has achieved:\n- Around $1.7b in TVL at its peak (currently around $460m),  across Ethereum, Optimism and Polygon\n- More than 25% of Uniswap V3s total TVL\n- More than 80 projects have their liquidity managed via Arrakis vaults\n\n**Arrakis PALM** - Protocol Automated Liquidity Management is a novel market making product sitting on top of UniV3.\n\nIn essence, PALM helps protocols bootstrap their base asset inventory (ETH, DAI, etc.) as well as attain deep and sustainable liquidity. The major advantages of using PALM include:\n- Zero incentive: no LM incentive needed, liquidity bootstrapping is done solely via market making.\n- No biased price impact: PALM conducts market making by setting up ranges \n / limit orders, no swaps involved.\n- Trustless: Stargate DAO retains the ownership of the liquidity and can withdraw at all times. PALM only autonomously manages the liquidity but can never remove it.\n- Highly customizable: PALM can be adjusted for various asset types and purposes beyond just liquidity bootstrapping.\n\nPALM has been deployed for a growing number (15) of protocols and is performing exactly as designed. To see a thread explaining these metrics and the performance of the GEL vault, you can have a look at this thread: https://twitter.com/ArrakisFinance/status/1623319923559636994\n\nYou can also read about how this vault has performed in extremely volatile situations here: https://twitter.com/ArrakisFinance/status/1630632476178776064\n\n**Background & Motivation**:\nRecently, the Stargate team has expressed the intention to integrate STG into other DeFi protocols, namely Radiant and other lending protocols such as Euler Finance, where STG can be used as collateral on the lending platform.\nThe UniV3 TWAP oracle is one that is accepted by various permissionless systems. In order for this oracle to be healthy it requires a liquid UniV3 market, the more liquid the less manipulatable it is. A good bench mark of the oracle risk can be calculated as the cost of moving the TWAP by 20% both on the sell and buy side.\nUsing this system, the current minimum cost of moving the UniV3 TWAP of STG by 20.89% is about $24k over 1 block, which makes it easy to manipulate.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreibo62zkmjkjumt5z5c2y462n5lkcu4irwvcnvhdmug2qi45j5a5fq)\n    \nThe primary cause of the low cost of attack is the Uni pool's low liquidity and liquidity distribution. For instance, CAW, a random token just for comparison purposes, has less liquidity than STG on UniV3, but a significantly higher cost of attack due to the structure of the liquidity. \n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifkyjggb6cad7il2fyytlkx2wfe3uvwppad5jesv5fxt7j6liquey)\n     \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifeqdfm7luhj2zsa6ri34brktmo4h24d6376uzyib4lq2ojrs4gqi)\n     \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifdvvkxf3axubalkxxud4246odglnklmbycjtvrfwiqznfgspzb4e)\n    \nFor this reason, we propose that Stargate use Arrakis PALM to manage its liquidity on UniV3, which will help STG create a secure oracle, and also bootstrap deep liquidity for STG on Uniswap.\n\n**Specification**\nStargate DAO creates a 1% fee tier UniV3 pool for STG/USDC. Arrakis then deploys a dedicated vault managed by PALM for the pool. Stargate DAO deposits $500k worth of STG and $500k worth of USDC into the vault.\nPALM will allocate 50% of that liquidity towards a full price range and utilize the other 50% in a concentrated and fully active market making strategy. The primary objective is to create a robust UniV3 oracle for STG.\n\n**Yield**\nEstimating yield from LPing is very difficult since it  depends on volumes, volatility and the amount of liquidity, which are all impossible to predict. What we can do is to backtest how PALM would have done historically if it had been actively market making. We have backtested PALM with the amount mentioned above and compared it with holding. Value of Holding being if the DAO would just hold the 50% STG and 50% USDC over the same time period. As we can see, PALM outperforms holding while the price is going down, and is on par with the holding on the way up . A small note, this excludes all of the fees that the vault generates.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreifpop5s2hmmu6pnpvybwqsltzsv2enohl5a65mpjz7r4xlm4lyqqa)\n    \nFor the services provided, Arrakis charges the following fees:\nManagement fee: 1% AUM fee on a yearly basis \nTrading fee cut: 50% of trading fees the vault generates\n\n**Reference**\nFor more information regarding Arrakis and Arrakis PALM, feel free to have a look at our docs and join our community. I’m also more than happy to respond to any comments here from the Stargate community about this proposal!\nWebsite: https://www.arrakis.finance/\nDocs: https://resources.arrakis.fi/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ArrakisFinance\nDiscord: https://discord.com/invite/arrakisfinance\nTelegram: https://t.me/arrakisfinance",

      "title": "Make Velodrome the STG Hub on Optimism",
      "content": "Background\nCurrently Stargate has protocol owned liquidity across each of the original seven chains it deployed on. These are Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, BNB Chain, Optimism and Arbitrum. Each liquidity pair sits in a DEX, providing liquidity to trade STG and earning fees from trades.\n\nProposal\nVelodrome is the leading DEX on Optimism and the top Ethereum Layer 2 DEX with over $300M TVL. It serves as the the primary liquidity hub for the quickly growing Optimism ecosystem, serving 2x - 3x as many protocols of comparable DEXs.\n\nVelodrome works by directing VELO emissions to liquidity pools based on votes by veVELO (vote-escrow VELO) holders. Protocols can use veVELO or voter incentives (bribes) to attract votes and emissions for their liquidity pairs. In the last voting round, bribers received $3.5 in VELO for every $1 in bribes on average.\n\nOn top of the bribe multiplier, Velodrome incentives will match at least 25% of Stargate's bribes per the \"Tour de OP\" incentive program, if Stargate moves $1.5M of POL (protocol owned liquidity) to Velodrome and bribes STG-USDC pool. Combined, the bribe multiplier and bribe match can yield a 4X+ impact on liquidity incentives for STG-USDC.\n\nThe LP will still be used and routed through all aggregators, resulting in the same execution, but an APR higher than what Stargate is getting on the current Uniswap pools will be paid.\n\nIf this pair performs well, Stargate will additionally have the option to migrate additional POL to Optimism to add to Velodrome and receive additional VELO emissions. The Velodrome team will also work to promote Stargate through their ecosystem, onboarding new users to Stargate. This aligns Stargate with a large and engaged community of DeFi users.\n\nStargate will also lock farmed $VELO rewards as veVELO to significantly reduce the need for STG emissions in the future while maintaining a robust liquidity layer on Optimism. Additionally, locking veVELO will automatically qualify Stargate for a Lock Bonus, typically worth 30%-40% of the VELO locked, paid in OP.\n\nExecution\n$1.5m of POL will be moved from the Uniswap LP pool to Velodrome on Optimism. Simultaneously, Stargate will begin test run worth $500k in STG to bribe the STG-USDC pool at a rate of $100K per week. Velodrome incentives will match at least 25% of Stargate's bribes each week.\nOnce a voting epoch is completed on Wednesday at 23:59 UTC, VELO emissions will flow to Stargate's LP. If successful, this proposal will result in a higher APR to Stargate's LP and a significant reduction of STG emissions over time.\n\nFor the purposes of the pilot, Startgate will focus on locking all VELO farmed as veVELO to build a veVELO voting position and maximize the ROI provided by \"Tour de OP Incentives. This will also earn Stargate additional bribe boosts and lock bonuses which will be compounded into more $veVELO, creating an exponential effect to early $veVELO accumulation. As that position grows, it will direct additional emissions to STG pools, generate fee rewards and bribe revenue that can also be compounded into additional $veVELO.\n\nWhile the focus during the course of this pilot will be to maximally compound rewards, once the veNFT position reaches DAO targets, the DAO can begin to repurpose fees, bribes, and emissions for other purposes. The goal being to reach a state where the DAO can bribe and sustain liquidity without needing additional $STG emissions.",

      "title": "Proposal to Bootstrap liquidity for Stargate USDT pools on Pendle",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nThe Pendle protocol enables permissionless tokenization and trading of yield. Pendle allows anyone to purchase assets at a discount, obtain fixed yield, or long DeFi yield. The protocol enables this by taking yield-bearing tokens and then splitting them into their principal and yield components, PT (principal token) and YT (yield token) respectively, which allows them to be traded via Pendle’s AMM.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiauwoetug4ydoopxmmltwi6b4ydvs6ieawhmsp7bqjuve2tlvhxgq)\n    \n**Section 1 - Issue Statement**\n\nStargate liquidity providers can earn STG rewards by allocating their LP tokens to a Stargate farm. Pendle intends to create yield markets for the staked LP positions on Stargate by tokenizing them — splitting the LP token into the yield and principal components — therefore expanding their use case. This is made possible by wrapping the farming position into an [EIP-5115](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5115) SY token that is directly utilizable on Pendle.\n\nBy creating a yield market, Pendle unlocks the full potential of yield. Pendle enables users to execute advanced yield strategies, such as:\n\n* Long assets at a discount\n* Fixed yield for low-risk, stable growth\n* Leverage exposure to future yield streams without the need for collateral\n* A mix of any of the above strategies\n* Any asset deposited into Pendle goes back to Stargate’s farming TVL.\n\n**Section 2 - Solution**\n\nStargate has protocol owned liquidity (PoL) for the different stablecoins across each of the eight chains it is deployed on, namely Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Fantom, and Metis. As Pendle is deployed on Ethereum and Arbitrum, it intends to create the first yield markets for Stargate for USDT on those chains.\n\nPendle is requesting that Stargate move $100k each of their USDT PoL on Ethereum and Arbitrum ($200k in total) to bootstrap the Pendle Stargate-USDT yield market pools. Any deposits into these yield markets go back directly to Stargate’s farming TVL. So the requested USDT PoL would still be owned and fully represented in Stargate’s overall TVL.\n\nIn return, Stargate will receive additional incentives in the form of swap fees generated by the Pendle AMM and PENDLE incentives. The Pendle team will also work to promote and co-market with Stargate by onboarding more users into Stargate via Pendle’s yield markets. This aligns Stargate with a large and engaged community of DeFi users.\n\n**Section 3 - Success**\n\nIf successful, this proposal will result in a bootstrapped Stargate-USDT yield market that immediately allows users to trade yield or allowing them to provide liquidity into the pool by zapping in with lower price impact. This will allow Stargate’s USDT PoL to continue to grow and expand its use to allow the greater DeFi market to trade yield.\n\nThrough Pendle, this will allow Stargate’s USDT pool to grow in TVL as well, as any deposits made through Pendle will directly be contributed back to Stargate. When compared to the last previous launches, Pendle has:\n\n1. contributed to 73% of the growth on Gains Networks’s gDAI pool since launch (9th Mar 2023);\n    - gDAI liquidity grew by 3.6M LP; Pendle contributed 2.6M LP;\n\n2. contributed to 272% growth in Aura’s ankrETH-WETH pool since launch (16th Mar 2023);\n    - Aura ankrETH-WETH liquidity grew by 329 LP; Pendle contributed 893 LP;\n\n**Section 4 - Execution**\n\n$100k each of USDT PoL from Ethereum and Arbitrum (totaling $200k) will move from the Stargate USDT pool into the Pendle Stargate-USDT pool on both Ethereum and Arbitrum. Stargate will reserve the right to remove the USDT PoL from the Pendle pools at any point in time.\n\n**Section 5 - Timeline and Costs**\n\nMarch 28th, 2023:\n\n* Stargate team to move $100k of USDT PoL from Stargate into Pendle on Ethereum to bootstrap the Pendle yield market;\n* Stargate team to move $100k of USDT PoL from Stargate into Pendle on Arbitrum to bootstrap the Pendle yield market;\n\nMarch 30th, 2023:\n\n* Pendle team to announce and launch the Stargate-USDT yield market on Pendle;\n\n**Section 6 - Summary**\n\n* Pendle will launch a Stargate-USDT yield market on Ethereum and Arbitrum.\n* Pendle is requesting for Stargate to move $100k each of their USDT PoL on Arbitrum and Ethereum ($200k in total) into the Pendle Stargate-USDT yield market. Any deposits made through Pendle go directly back to Stargate’s TVL.\n* At launch of the yield market, we can expect the DeFi community to be able to purchase USDT at a discount or to trade yield via Pendle. We expect the overall USDT TVL on Stargate to increase by at least 20% once this yield market is live.\n\n**Section 7 - Poll**\n\nKindly vote on the poll to gauge sentiment on this proposal.",

      "title": "Proposal to Approve Stargate Deployment to BASE, zkSync, Polygon zkEVM and ConsenSys zkEVM",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nCoinbase recently announced the launch of their L2, BASE (https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1628760201254903809). In addition, Polygon zkEVM, ConsenSys zkEVM and zkSync are launching their blockchains at some point in the future. Stargate should launch on all four of these chains if technically feasible to help facilitate liquidity transfer between zkSync and the other eight chains Stargate currently supports.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nStargate should launch on all of these chains as soon as possible, enabling bridging of stables (USDC and USDT) and ETH. This will allow Stargate to capture day one market share as well as establish itself as the de facto bridge in up-and-coming ecosystems. To support these pools, Stargate should emit STG to allow enough total value locked (TVL) within the pools to reach a level that is commensurate with the transfer volume observed per https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x7839f919ddd2c226ef0f050ce9250b0f1f41c1d94bf0ab8fdc9205b151fe3a2a.\n\n**Execution**\n\nStargate will be deployed on BASE, Polygon zkEVM, ConsenSys zkEVM and zkSync shortly after the official mainnet launch of the chain and USDC, USDT and ETH pools should be enabled. STG emissions will be enabled on those pools when launched as well.\n\n**Summary**\n\nStargate has the opportunity to become the bridging leader on multiple new blockchains that are launching in 2023. By being an early protocol to launch, Stargate can become the de facto third party bridge for  moving value to and from these chains, creating transfer volume, and value for Stargate and its community.

Stargate would undertake a large cost to reissue the token, along with material risk around its outcome. All of this, was to try to help the safety of the tokens in question. This is now being challenged with the liquidators clearly not wanting them moved.\n\nAs the legal process plays out, it is hopeful the tokens will be returned to LayerZero Labs and passed onto the Stargate DAO as proposed, but nothing at this time is certain. What Stargate should do is ensure that the protocol is protected. \n\nA fair number of exchanges have expressed support for the reissuance. The Foundation should work with those exchanges to resume support for the original STG token.",

      "title": "Liquidity Reallocation from POL-LP to POL-Pools",
      "content": "Background\nBy increasing Stargate POL, Stargate improves its functionality and reduces the need for emissions.  With POL growth, emissions or the need for them, is reduced and eventually eliminated as Stargate no longer needs to “rent” liquidity. For every $1 of added POL, the protocol currently reduces the need for $0.07-0.09 worth of STG emissions per year (7-9%). Of course, POL growth allows Stargate to be a reliable source of cross-chain liquidity for everyone.\nAt this stage, the Stargate LP is not the highest use of liquidity and has a higher effective value if deployed in POL.  Historically, the Stargate LP has earned an organic APR of less than 3-4%. This is significantly lower than the current 7-9% APR paid for rented liquidity within Stargate. Stargate can save significant emissions (Around 3x emissions saved versus a dollar earned from LP) with the LP stables in Stargate. Stargate is now able to save many hundreds of thousands of dollars in emissions on an annual basis when looking at the data available.\n\nAt the same time, the need for the DEX liquidity is not as great as it was at inception.  Thus a reallocation of POL from LP to Stargate pool should not materially impact STG trading.  The current on chain volumes are significantly less than centralized exchange (CEX) volumes, with a majority of the liquidity sitting unused on a daily basis. STG trades overwhelmingly more volume on centralized exchanges versus on-chain historically. \n\nWhen Stargate launched on March 17th, 2022, there were two community auctions, raising a total of $29,960,911 worth of USDC to be added for protocol owned liquidity (POL) liquidity pairs (LP). As of today, Feb 26, 2023 there is a total of $42,716,854.99 worth of USDC within Stargate POL LP (there is a total of over $85 million dollars of total POL including STG within the LP). This accumulation has occurred due to trading fees and price fluctuations.\n\nProposal\nBy having POL within Stargate pool, the protocol is in a significantly better position. It reduces significantly more emissions than it earns in native yield while helping the protocol rapidly approach zero emissions. \nWith the passing of the recent proposal to hire a market maker for Stargate (https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x82586192cf58f438cfee7101afde68df11ab3be071a6f7c05d1a3e8506836ee2), centralized exchange liquidity will become even more robust. As CEX volume makes up a majority of STG volume currently, this will only help the STG market flow freely, complimented by the on-chain POL LP.\n\nAn ideal adjustment would mean removing $10,000,000 worth of POL from LP into Stargate pools while dramatically reducing the need for STG emissions within Stargate. At current emission rates and prices at time of writing, this would result in a reduction of over $700,000 to $900,000 worth of STG per year. This reduction would drastically increase the path to Stargate being able to turn off all emissions and be fully self-sufficient, owning 100% of the liquidity within the protocol.\n\nExecution\nStargate will remove $10,000,000 worth of LP from the various POL LP pairs on Ethereum, adding the equal amount into Stargate pools to support transfer liquidity.\n\nSummary\nStargate removes significantly more emissions from the protocol by having liquidity within Stargate instead of LP on-chain. By redirecting $10,000,000 of POL from LP to Stargate pools, this will allow Stargate to dramatically reduce emissions (over $700,000 to $900,000 per year) and strengthen the protocol. This change will result in Stargate saving over three times the rate of yield on the LP in protocol emissions. This still ensures there is robust on-chain liquidity while optimizing Stargate POL for the optimal outcomes. ",

      "title": "Beefy x Stargate: Integration Proposal",
      "content": "Brief intro about Beefy:\nBeefy is a multi-chain yield optimizer present in 19 different blockchains (8 of which are shared with Stargate). Currently offering more than 600 vaults that compound rewards generated by almost $400M TVL. Beefy has many strong traits, two of the most outstanding ones are a big focus on security, and great user experience.\n\nUser experience wise, we are constantly improving our contracts, design, and application, to make DeFi available for everyone. This can be seen in our app, which loads info from +600 vaults with efficient RPC calls, and displays everything without focusing on which chain you are connected to, giving our users a see-through view of all DeFi opportunities, allowing them to choose the best yields.\n\nWe just integrated 1inch in the back, so you can enter any vault, with any token with 2 transactions (1 approval and 1 contract call). This is a huge leap in user experience, since in the past, you would need up to 7 transactions, and jump between different protocols, making the DeFi experience overwhelming and cumbersome.\n\nIssue Statement:\nThere are still things to improve in the DeFi experience. The biggest one is moving value across different blockchains. Getting the correct tokens, the right amounts, and finding an appropriate bridge can still be a daunting experience for some inexperienced users. \n\nIt's also worth noting that you have to pay transaction fees for all of this.\n\nSolution:\nNow, we are making another leap in terms of UX, making the cross-chain experience even easier thanks to technologies developed by Stargate that haven't been available in the past.\n\nStargate technologies are empowering the Beefy engineering team to create a truly cross-chain seamless experience. Allowing users to enter and exit vaults without leaving the app, without the need to know how to use DEXes, bridges, get gas on the destination chain, etc.\n\nWe want to incorporate into our solution, a reward-system that compensates the gas paid for bridging in and out of Optimism. Bridging through Stargate currently costs 6bps of the transaction. We would develop a smart-contract that reimburses those 6bps back to the user in OP tokens. This would motivate users to use this newly implemented solution, bringing more TVL to Beefy, more volume to Stargate bridges, and overall more adoption to the Optimism ecosystem.\n\nSince Beefy is completely open-source we are sure this functionality (like many before) will be replicated by other protocols, making Stargate the de-facto bridge to transfer tokens seamlessly between chains, without leaving said dApp.\n\nWe are requesting 75,000 OP tokens. 80% will be used to periodically fund the contract that reimburses the bridge costs, and the remaining 20% will be used for marketing and promotions around the launch of this revolutionary feature.\n\nSuccess:\nWe aim to distribute the whole amount in a course of 12 months, bringing around $40M of bridged volume to Stargate. If we manage to capture that amount we will call the initiative a success.\n\nExecution:\nThe Beefy team will create a new section in our app, where users will see all of their stablecoins (USDC, USDT, DAI) and ETH no matter what chain they are connected to, and they will be able to choose to which of the vault they wanna deposit in (from the 8 chains Stargate and Beefy share). So if you are connected to Polygon, and wanna zap+deposit the stablecoins that you have in Arbitrum into the wstETH-ETH vault on Optimism, the app will prompt you to change the network, and do 2 transactions (approval and contract interaction). The app and contracts in the back will take care of bridging your stablecoins, trading them on the most efficient routes through 1inch to get wstETH and ETH, provide liquidity, and deposit the LP tokens in your behalf, also you will be reimbursed of the 6BPS that Stargate charges you (discounted from your initial stablecoins) in OP.\n\nWithdrawing from vaults will also be possible with this feature. You will see the Beefy vaults where you have deposits (limited to the 8 shared chains), and will be able to exit your position and bridge with just 2 transactions. (and get reimbursed for the bridge fees).\n\nIn the future we will extend the future so you can start the flow with any token, and our Zap will take care of getting the USDC/USDT/DAI/ETH to bridge (and the same for withdrawal).\n\nTimeline and costs:\nOur team is working hard to have the most complete and easy to use DeFi app in the space. For this we need to keep adding features in a way that respects our design, and does not collide with other characteristics of our app. We also need to restructure our API to support this feature, deploy new contracts, and test exhaustively the feature to make sure our users have the same amazing experience as always using Beefy. We are aiming to have all of these tasks completed by Q3 2023. There will be no extra costs that need to be considered in this proposal.\n\nSummary:\nBeefy will develop a new feature to enter and exit vaults no matter what chain you are connected to. To promote the adoption of the feature we will incentivize users reimbursing the Stargate fees with OP tokens. We will leverage our socials and partners to bring excitement to the feature. Tokens will be distributed in a period of 12 months, features will be live in Q3 2023 and we expect to bring around $40M of Volume.",

      "content": "**Background**\n\nCurrently Stargate has protocol owned liquidity across each of the original seven chains it deployed on. These are Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, BNB Chain, Optimism and Arbitrum. Each liquidity pair sits in a dex, providing liquidity to trade STG and earning fees from trades.\nIn the past proposal “PancakeSwap Farm Proposal”, the Stargate DAO ratified moving $2 million of POL to PancakeSwap (https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0xae1ebaebd42f44483c06cb0e8e7cdbc1f5aca52843b27017132ab8dbd8ef9158). \n\n**Proposal** \n\nPancakeSwap is requesting that Stargate move an additional $5m of POL (protocol owned liquidity) to PancakeSwap on Ethereum. This would result in $7m of total POL residing on PancakeSwap on Ethereum (the original $2M and an additional $5M of in this proposal). In return PancakeSwap will give Stargate an average of a 7.5% or higher APR, based on $7M of total TVL, paid in CAKE in emissions for the additional LP moving to PancakeSwap.\n\nThe PancakeSwap team will also continue to work to promote Stargate through their ecosystem, onboarding new users to Stargate. This aligns Stargate with a large and engaged community of DeFi users.\n\n**Execution**\n\n$5m of POL will be removed from the Curve LP pool and moved to PancakeSwap on Ethereum. Once moved, additional emissions for this LP will be enabled by PancakeSwap providing an APR of at least 7.5% to the total TVL providing by the Stargate DAO in that pool. If the emissions drop below 7%, Stargate will reserve the right to remove the lp from PancakeSwap and return it to a platform where the APR is highest at that point.\n\n**Success**\n\nIf successful this proposal will result in a higher APR paid to Stargate in return for where it holds lp. This will allow Stargate POL to continue to grow more quickly, reducing the need for emissions and building a more robust liquidity layer.",

      "content": "Engaging a market maker for Stargate was proposed in SIP 24 (https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x9f220b762e40e2fc8166b15e64510a0843bb8328f48d1407a800ae1a63f577fd) and 25 (https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x8ca03295d142b8ed1dc55adffdaec3bd24d4a9613a44c1aa983907f3dab5ec9d). Both posts ended with a positive signal but did not hit the 70% quorum required for them to move forwards (https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0xfb862e6810019e8bf3282a1e06d2077edf28424bfc830562e56b91db0a70e861).\n\nWhile these votes have been ongoing, multiple exchanges contacted the Stargate Foundation about Stargate’s liquidity issues on centralized exchanges and notified that the token will be delisted or deprioritized in the future if a market maker is not engaged by the Stargate DAO.\n\nDelisting will also have negative consequences to the on chain volume for the STG token. Currently, the Stargate DAO owns almost all on chain liquidity and earns significant fees from trading activity that uses this liquidity. A portion of the activity is arbitrage between on chain liquidity and centralized exchanges. A lack of a robust centralized exchange pool results in less liquidity and decreases the ability for this arbitrage to happen and results in less fees earned by the DAO. \n\nProcess:\n\nNumerous market makers were considered to bring forward one proposal that the community can vote on, if enough signal that this is interesting to do is given. The proposal will list details about the market maker, and some base details of their proposal. Due to competitive edge, not all details can be shared. \nIf this advances to voting, the Stargate DAO will select one of two options: \nThe first option is that the marketer maker proposed, GSR, will be chosen and the DAO will proceed with GSR as the market maker for STG.\n\nThe second option is no market maker will be chosen, the proposal will be voted down and the DAO will proceed without a market maker for the foreseeable future.\n\nAbout GSR:\n\nGSR is a leading market maker, ecosystem partner, and active, multi-stage investor. In addition to the veteran traditional finance and derivatives background of its founders, GSR maintains an ethos of client service that is at the center of its offerings. \n\nWith 250+ employees around the globe and a core engineering and trading focus, GSR uses nearly a decade of market data and crypto expertise to continuously refine and expand its trading engines and programmatic execution capabilities, with a focus on providing best-in-class service to projects across different stages of their development. Its trading technology is connected to 30+ exchanges, including major decentralized exchanges (DEX’s) and lending protocols.\n\nGSR works with projects across the entire crypto ecosystem, and has considerable expertise across the decentralized finance (DeFi) space - with a particular focus on core infrastructure, security, and protocol levels. It has provided, at times, over US$1bn of liquidity a day to DeFi markets, while investing heavily in DeFi protocols across the Web3 ecosystem. Going beyond the breadth of its investments, integrations, and infrastructure, GSR is committed to being an active and reputable collaborator in the space, highlighted, in part, by the launch of GSRBlue: its marquee long-term NFT portfolio of well-known creators and projects.\n\nGSR is operating as normal and remains focused on maintaining liquidity for our clients despite the market events of last year. As standard practice we proactively manage our exposures to all exchanges and reduce dynamically where necessary. GSR is well-positioned to navigate the high volatility and continues to actively deploy capital to maintain healthy liquidity in both private and listed linear and nonlinear products in the space.\n\nTerms:\n\nThe following terms can be shared about GSR’s offer. \n\nNumber of tokens requested: 8,000,000\nLength of term: 24 months\nStrike mechanism: European option (https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/08/american-european-options.asp) after 24 months at an average price greater than $1.15. The exact price is not shared to protect market integrity.\n\nA european option is an option that is not exercisable until the end of the term. The price of STG has to be over the price of the option to make it worth it for GSR to actually accept it. In this case GSR would return a cash equivalent to the DAO. If it is not over the strike, they will have market made STG for free, returning all tokens at the end of the term to the Stargate DAO. This aligns GSR with the long term success of Stargate protocol for the entire term of the agreement while providing much needed liquidity to the market. \n\nIn this case, they are BUYING the STG tokens at that price in the option, i.e. if STG at the strike price they make $0 profit they only acquire tokens at fair market value which are worth exactly what they paid for them.",

      "title": "STG Reissue",
      "content": "Tldr; Stargate should re-issue a new STG and airdrop it to all STG holders\nBackground\n\nStargate faces a significant threat to its POL and to the security of token holders due to potential security issues within Alameda Research (Alameda). To ensure the safekeeping of Launch Auction Stargate tokens, the StargateDAO proposes to re-issue all Stargate tokens (STG). By re-issuing STG, StargateDAO would eliminate the risk of illegitimate STG transfers from compromised Alamada wallets and would protect the interest of all token holders.\n\nAs background, on March 17, 2022 Alameda purchased 10% of the total STG supply from the Stargate Community sale. Alameda subsequently publicly committed to lockup all these tokens until March 2025 (https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1506306854825119748). Recent on-chain transfers from known Alameda wallets reveal that Alameda does not have full control of its wallets and that a malicious actor or hacker is misappropriating Alameda’s funds (https://cointelegraph.com/news/alameda-wallets-funnel-over-1-7m-via-crypto-mixers-overnight, https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1608204990581202946, https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1608087397107142658).\n\nThe consequence of a bad actor controlling Alameda’s wallets and the potential harm to token holders and Stargate cannot be understated. Without a token re-issuance a malicious actor with access to Alameda’s private keys could claim the Stargate tokens from the contract as they vest and misappropriate them as they seem to have with other funds. If such an actor were to claim and dump STG on the market, in violation of the three year lockup agreement, the following could occur. The actor would hypothetically claim the tokens as they vest to the wallets over a 6 month period for example. This would introduce 100,000,000 STG (10% of total supply) into the circulating supply over the next 6 months. This could be dumped into existing LP, draining stablecoins from POL as Stargate owns its own liquidity.\n\nWe recognize that there may be ongoing discussions surrounding the 100M tokens as part of the Alameda bankruptcy process. As such, we propose the Stargate Foundation set aside these tokens in a separate wallet where they will remain untouched until there has been clarity or a court order from one or both parties.\n\nProposal\nStargate will reissue STG on March 15th, 2023. This will result in a state where the current STG will no longer power Stargate while a new STG contract replaces it. Users would not have to do anything for this swap to happen. On March 15th, a snapshot would be taken of all user balances, and a new token will be sent to every user on a 1:1 basis.\n\nDoing this reissue will ensure that the 100,000,000 tokens (10% of total supply) Alameda acquired and then sold will not be stolen and sold onto the market, negatively impacting Stargate. The launch auction portion will be custodied in a designated mutisig wallet until further instructions are given by stakeholders. They will not be moved in any way absent such direction.\n\nExecution\nStargate should reissue STG on March 15, 2023 at a 1:1 basis for the existing STG token. Existing holders would have the new STG token airdropped to them (based on a snapshot taken the same day at a pre-announced time), including any unclaimed rewards earned in any farms at the snapshot date. Any unassigned tokens in any contracts would be returned to the Stargate DAO to ensure a clean transition.\n24 hours prior to the snapshot all protocol owned LP would be removed from any on chain spots it exists within. All exchanges that currently support STG will be asked to pause deposit and withdrawals for the same 24 hour period. After the new token exists, the LP will be re-added with the new token as the pair, and all exchanges will be asked to resume deposits and withdrawals honoring the new token.\n\nAll users with STG vested as veSTG and aaSTG will have their vests reissued where upon unlock, they will receive the new STG token. This will allow all users to maintain the same terms of their locks and voting rights associated with them.\n\nFinally, all farm contracts will be re-enabled with the new STG token as the reward given and users will be asked to deposit liquidity into the new contracts to resume farming STG and supporting Stargate.\n\nSuccess\nSuccess is defined as STG V2 launching and replacing STG. Upon successful reissue, all functions of the STG token will be identical to STG.\n\nSummary\nStargate faces a material threat to POL and the security of token holders due to potential security issues within Alameda Research. A token swap to a new STG token is proposed with holders getting an identical token to their current supply and state for STG.\n\nA successful migration would prevent a potential catastrophic downside to the protocol while maintaining smooth function robust markets for STG.",

      "content": "Issue Statement\nWOO Network has always been holding the chain agnostic approach and actively engaging in various blockchain ecosystems. WOOFi (fi.woo.org) as the flagship decentralized exchange is deployed across 6 different blockchains including Arbitrum, Avalanche, BSC, Fantom, Optimism and Polygon. Ranked in top 15 dex volume according to DeFiLlama, WOOFi is the first dex that built the cross chain swap feature on top of Stargate back in June 2022. At the same time, WOO token exists on almost all the major chains and WOOFi has the WOO staking module on each chain.\n\nWith all that, it’s natural to take advantage of the APD and add WOO pools on Stargate on all the chains WOOFi supports and enable WOO cross chain bridging natively in WOOFi’s cross chain swap feature.\n\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafkreicsmcxmo4spc36rzp6e4fpx4m6ky4pydr7iukv6soqo3twh4gyuwe)\n    \n    \n\nSolution\nAdd WOO to Stargate on all 7 chains (i.e. Ethereum, BSC, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, Fantom, Polygon) that Stargate supports and allow bridging between any two networks. WOO Network will deposit 1M WOO on each chain to facilitate cross-chain bridging.\n\nSuccess\nWOOFi is already offering cross chain swaps on top of Stargate with one of the best users experiences with true one click swap and high execution quality.\nWith this proposal, WOOFi can integrate WOO pools on Stargate and allows users to cross-chain bridge and swap WOO at lower cost. WOOFi also plans to have deeper integration with Stargate and Layerzero in its other modules such as Earn and Stake.\n\nExecution\nStargate will handle the smart contract deployment and front end development. WOO Network will seed the liquidity and add WOO bridging in WOOFi.\n\nSummary\n1. WOOFi is the first dex that built cross chain swap feature on top of Stargate.\n\n2. WOOFi’s multichain vision aligns with Stargate and is keen to build WOO \n  token utilities in various blockchain ecosystems.\n\n3. WOO Network proposes to add WOO pools in Stargate on all 7 supported \n  blockchains and seed 1M WOO on each chain to start with.\n\n4. WOOFi will enable WOO cross chain bridging / swapping on top of Stargate \n  natively in the WOOFi UI.\n\n5. There is great synergy between the products offered by WOOFi, Stargate and Layerzero, with WOO supported on Stargate it makes a lot easier for WOOFi to have deeper integration with Stargate and Layerzero in other products such as earn and stake.",

      "content": "Background\nCurrently Stargate has protocol owned liquidity across each of the original seven chains it deployed on. These are Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, BNB Chain, Optimism and Arbitrum. Each liquidity pair sits in a dex, providing liquidity to trade STG and earning fees from trades. \n\nProposal\nStargate has been approached by PancakeSwap requesting that it move $2m of POL (protocol owned liquidity) to PancakeSwap on Ethereum. In return PancakeSwap will give Stargate an average of a 15% or higher APR, based on $2M TVL, paid in CAKE in emissions for the LP moving to there. The LP will still be used and routed through all aggregators, resulting in the same execution, but an APR higher than what Stargate is getting on the current Curve pools will be paid. \n\nIf this pair performs well, Stargate will additionally have the option to migrate additional POL to BNB Chain to add to PancakeSwap to recieve additional emissions as determined by the PancakeSwap team.\n\nThe PancakeSwap team will also work to promote Stargate through their ecosystem, onboarding new users to Stargate. This aligns Stargate with a large and engaged community of DeFi users.\n\nExecution\n$2m of POL will be removed from the Curve LP pool and moved to PancakeSwap on Ethereum. Once moved, emissions for this LP will be enabled by PancakeSwap providing an APR of at least 15% to that pool. If the emissions drop below 10%, Stargate will reserve the right to remove the lp from PancakeSwap and return it to a platform where the APR is highest at that point.\n\nSuccess\nIf successful this proposal will result in a higher APR paid to Stargate in return for where it holds lp. This will allow Stargate POL to continue to grow more quickly, reducing the need for emissions and building a more robust liquidity layer.",

      "content": "The Stargate Foundation has been approached by an individual representing he works with a family office that is looking to acquire $2,000,000 of STG at market price from the Stargate DAO. As this is the first time this has happened, the issue is being brought forward to the Stargate DAO. \n\nShould the Stargate DAO complete this transaction, selling $2,000,000 worth of STG (priced as a three day time weighted average price (Twap) of the STG price) for USDC. This USDC would then be used to purchase ETH that is locked into Stargate POL and supports Stargate liquidity on Ethereum. Assuming a target APY of 5%, this would reduce STG emissions by $100,000 per year and strengthen Stargate’s permanent liquidity. \n\nIt is important to surface any proposals like this to the community to allow the Stargate DAO to make the determination around what to do with them and how to address the request.\n\nPlease note: although The Stargate Foundation brought this post to the forums, I am a community member posting it to Snapshot to move this issue forwards.

      "title": "SIP 26 - Featherproof",
      "content": "Background\nStargate currently uses MPT (merkle patricia trie) (https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero/blob/main/contracts/proof/MPTValidator01.so) in its LayerZero configuration as a validation library. This directly impacts gas cost paid to the relayer by Stargate and the end user sending a transaction.\n\nStargate currently uses the newest ULNv2 validation library (https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero/blob/main/contracts/UltraLightNodeV2.sol) that launched on September 5, 2022. This has been in production for over 4 months and has seen $2,203,933,589.46 volume pass through Stargate along with 1,501,174 messages over LayerZero. During the time Stargate has been using this LayerZero released a new validation library called Featherproof (https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero/blob/main/contracts/proof/FPValidator.sol) which is actively used when interacting with Aptos. Featherpoof has been used in production for 4 months, has seen 185,448 messages go across it. Featherproof secures large applications like CAKE, BTC.b, and TheAptosBridge and offers a drastic reduction in gas – reducing gas costs by over 20%. Gas costs have commonly and repeatedly been brought up as one of the largest limiting factors of the current Stargate implementation, this would be a massive improvement in that.\n\nProposal\nStargate should adopt Featherproof. This would result in a bare minimum cost of 20% less gas in all transactions and in certain edge cases (such as aggregators) can result in more than 90% less gas cost. A more consistent and significantly cheaper gas cost will make Stargate more usable, more frequently utilized within all third party routing, and offer a significantly better user experience to all.\n\nExecution\nA configuration change to the relayer Stargate uses would need to happen for this to be enabled. \nStargate will need to select Featherproof as it’s validation library rather than ULNv2. This can be done near immediately after this proposal passes.\n\nSuccess\nIf successful, Stargate’s gas usage will decrease by at least 20%. This will give Stargate an edge in an a bridge landscape that is growing more competitive over time. It will also improve user experience when interacting with Stargate by lowering the amount paid by the user.\n\nUpon success, Stargate will become significantly more competitive in the overall landscape for gas pricing and will reduce gas usage of at least 20%. Reducing gas cost will also improve user experience, rate of inclusion in aggregators, and generally reduce friction on the end user by a meaningful amount\n\nSummary\nStargate will migrate to the more gas efficient validation library Featherproof for all cross-chain transactions resulting in a significantly decreased cost to the end user and a more competitive Stargate experience.

      "title": "SIP#25 - Stargate MM (Revised Proposal)",
      "content": "Background\nStargate’s token, STG, is traded both on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and centralized exchanges (CEXs). STG is listed on centralized exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Huobi and Kucoin among others.\n\n\nProposal\nMarket makers provide a key service within centralized exchanges, by offering deep liquidity on both sides of a market (on both the bid and ask side). This results in deep liquidity being available on both sides of the book allowing market participants to interact with the token freely (buy and sell amounts without moving the price dramatically). \n\nWithout a market maker a exchanges orderbook tends to become illiquid, which could in turn lead to a poor user experience when interacting with the asset on that exchange. This can lead to an exchange deprioritizing or delisting that asset. Many of the largest centralized exchanges actually encourage an active market maker as a point of reference. \n\nMarket makers typically adhere to certain service level agreements (SLAs) covering a range of obligations such as spread, quote depth, uptime and other metrics to continually ensure a smooth functioning market. \nIn exchange for these services, market makers are usually either paid a fee for services rendered or compensated by a structured 'call' option that keeps them aligned with the asset they're market making for. \n\nAn example of an agreement is that the market maker may ensure $X depth within Y percent slippage for the asset and ensure they are available and servicing the market at least 99% of the time. After a fixed term they then will either return the asset borrowed for market making or a cash equivalent at a predetermined strike price. \n\nMarket makers typically require a loan of assets. Assets being loaned are important to a market maker because it allows them to service both sides of the market. An active market maker needs to be able to both buy an asset around its current price but also sell an asset around that same price to ensure market participants have enough liquidity to suit their desires around accumulating or divesting an asset.\n\nNumerous market makers have submitted proposals with loan requests ranging from 5,000,000 to 50,000,000 tokens and varying strike prices, some of which were below the actual current spot price. A competitive offer from a high reputable firm is key to successful market making in this environment. Combining a reputable custodian of the loan who has a track record of safeguarding client funds with a smaller loan size and a strike price that is significantly higher than the current market price ensures the party selected is vetted and aligned towards the long term success of Stargate.\n\n\nExecution\nSTG would be made available to a suitable and qualified market maker for STG under terms that do not exceed a loan of 8,000,000 STG for a 24 month period. \n\nThe up to 8,000,000 STG are loaned to a market maker who will then use them to support free flowing liquidity of STG across multiple venues. The market maker will take no fees for this service but will be given an option to buy the STG after the term expires at predetermined prices. This helps align their upside for services rendered with Stargates. They will help support a free flowing and robust market and any upside of token appreciation during that tenure is their reward for doing so.\n\nAfter the term, STG would be returned to The Foundation or an equivalent amount of USDC at a price of $0.80 or above per STG. The exact amount per STG will be equal to or higher than $0.80 but a floor is set to provide confidence in the number while also not revealing any data that would compromise market integrity.\n\n\nSuccess\nIf successful, A qualified market maker will be chosen with a strike price on the option granted of at least $0.80 (with goals of significantly higher) after a 24 month term. This will enable liquidity to be deeper across all centralized exchanges allowing for market participants to buy and/or sell STG more easily.\n\n\nSummary\nThe Stargate DAO shall loan up to 8,000,000 STG for a term of not more than 24 months to a qualified market maker to maintain liquidity for STG token. This will create more robust centralized exchange liquidity and allow for a better functioning STG market both on and off chain. Stargate Foundation shall secure the aforementioned requirements on behalf of Stargate DAO.",

      "title": "Stargate Deployment On Metis",
      "content": "**Background**\nBorn out of the need for permissionless and open collaboration, Metis Andromeda is an EVM Equivalent Ethereum Layer 2. MetisDAO Foundation is building a hub for the entire Web3 economy in 3 stages: an Ethereum Layer 2 providing top notch scalability; built-in on-chain reputation through the Matrix Reputation Power System, providing countless capabilities previously just available for Web2 and traditional finance; and a Decentralized Autonomous Company (DAC) framework facilitating the transition of Web2 onto Web3, and enabling both blockchain and Web2 companies to build decentralized businesses on-chain. All the functionalities of real-world enterprises and all the security and decentralization of Ethereum.\n\n**Proposal**\nStargate protocol was initially launched on 7 chains. The MetisDAO Foundation proposes for Stargate to launch on Metis now that there is the LayerZero endpoint on Metis mainnet. To start, the Foundation would like to request two pools:\n\n-USDT (connected to Metis, Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Avalanche)\n-APD for METIS between Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Metis.\n\nTo incentivize this launch and campaign, the MetisDAO Foundation proposes a 4 month grant distributed as:\n-$100k worth of METIS per month, 4 month period \n-$40,000 of METIS for liquidity incentives ($13,333 of METIS/month per pool [Metis, Ethereum, BNB Chain]), $60,000 of METIS for inbound transfer volume rebates monthly \n          -Pools on launch: USDT between Metis, Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Avalanche\n               -Stargate is requested to provide $2m of POL for Avalanche USDT Pool\n\nThis would be the first chain expansion for Stargate since it launched. As such, we would like to engage in a strong marketing campaign to fully capitalize on the successful expansion of Stargate’s cross-chain and interconnectivity mission, as well as highlighting the capital flow capabilities it has brought to Metis.\n\nThe inclusion of Metis in Stargate’s front end would open up more revenue streams and points of access to the Stargate DAO. One of those areas being our coveted Builder Mining Rewards (BMR) program, which pays out up to 4000 METIS/month to the builders driving the most activity and value. In addition, many Metis builders are already in touch with the LayerZero/Stargate team, and are actively planning to build on top of LayerZero and Stargate. Ultimately, this will drive more value, usage, and cohesion back to the DAO.\n\n**Success**\nThis proposal has two success measures: (I) Stargate Protocol is enabled to support USDT transfers to and from Metis, Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Avalanche, providing additional incremental access points for value transfer, ultimately enabling more fee capture for the Protocol; and (II) MetisDAO Foundation provides a 4-month grant incentivizing liquidity, as well as providing Stargate DAO with incremental revenue through value capture from providing liquidity on these liquidity paths. \n\n**Execution**\nStargate deploys on Metis, enabling the USDT pool to and from Metis, Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Avalanche.\n\nMetis launches APD for METIS token to and from Ethereum, Metis and BNB Chain.\n\nMetisDAO Foundation launches a marketing campaign to help highlight Stargate on Metis.\n\n**Summary**\nLaunching on a new chain will result in Stargate realizing more of its vision to be the ultimate omnichain liquidity layer, bringing more options for its users, and more volume through Stargate, ultimately driving more revenue for the DAO. On the other side, Stargate will become a core part of the Metis ecosystem, enabling more robust DeFi infrastructure on Metis, and bringing more utility to the network and its users.",

      "title": "Add LayerZero tokens (OFT tokens) to Stargate",
      "content": "Background:\n\nStargate should become a hub for LayerZero assets (OFT tokens). Stargate should enable OFT tokens as an option for users, allowing a wider variety of tokens able to be bridged through Stargate. This will result in users having a singular easy destination to move many tokens cross chain allowing the protocol to also capture more long tail token flow without the need for more STG emissions. \nProposal\nStargate should add OFT tokens to the UI enabling more tokens to be transferred through Stargate.\n\n\nSince OFT tokens rely on the LayerZero network for consensus, no new pools are required and no rewards are required to incentivize liquidity. We can see this in production with how the STG token moves through Stargate without the need for pools. \n\n\nA two basis point (2 bps) fee should be applied to any transactions as a convenience fee for providing an easy to use UI to move these tokens. This will generate additional revenue for the protocol. The 2 bps would be split proportionally between protocol fees, veSTG fees and partner fees based on the current ratios used within Stargate. \nSuccess\nSuccess is when the Stargate Protocol is enabled to support more native OFT tokens, enabling it to drive more volume and offer users a singular place to move a larger variety of tokens cross chain while generating more revenue for Stargate. \nExecution\nOnce the smart contracts are completed and deployed, this will need to be implemented in the back end and into the front end. Lists will need to be updated on respective networks to reflect the changes.\n \nSummary\nStargate should support native LayerZero tokens (OFT tokens) in the swap list while charging a small convenience fee (2 bps) for moving them. \n",

      "content": "**Background**\n\nStargate currently incentivizes a number of pools (USDC, USDT, ETH, DAI, SUSD, FRAX and LUSD), targeting a general TVL (total value locked) for each pool. Currently Stargate’s TVL in some pools is higher than needed to support current and projected transfer volumes and/or the protocol is emitting more emissions than needed resulting in APRs that are higher than the minimum required to incentivize the required TVL in those pools. By aligning emissions with pool utilization, the protocol can target an optimal TVL for each pool. This will allow for more efficient emissions to truly support protocol volumes with a goal towards overall reduction of emissions.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nStargate should align emissions with pool utilization. This would allow the protocol to target an optimal and healthy TVL for each pool to facilitate the transfer of value and provide efficient liquidity. An overall emission reduction would also be targeted as protocol owned liquidity and protocol efficiency continues to improve.\n\n**Success**\n\nA successful implementation will ensure there is enough liquidity in each pool to support historical transfer volume. In tandem a community driven goal would be implemented to reduce overall emissions to continually aim for a state where protocol revenue is higher than emissions.\n\n**Execution**\n\nThe protocol will periodically adjust emissions based on historical transfer volumes and calculated liquidity required to support them. The protocol will then either increase or decrease the amount of STG or equivalent token given out incentives to hit those targets.\n\n**Summary**\n\nStargate currently incentivizes liquidity across a number of tokens. Stargate will proactively work to adjust emissions to efficiently incentivize the required pools. This will allow the protocol to function more efficiently with a general goal of emission reductions if warranted. ",

      "content": "**Background**\n\nAt the launch of the Stargate Protocol, thresholds for posting proposals to the community Snapshot (https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth) was set at 150,000 veSTG, with a minimum quorum based on the type of proposal (Core or Protocol). For Core proposals there is a 10% quorum threshold with a 80% support threshold. For Protocol proposals there is a 5% quorum threshold with a 60% support threshold. A full overview of the types of proposals and current voting process can be seen in the following document: https://stargateprotocol.gitbook.io/stargate/v/user-docs/governance/proposals-and-voting\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThe Stargate community should lower the threshold for posting to 50,000 veSTG, with a minimum quorum 2.5% and a 70% support threshold for community proposals. The safeguards around Core proposals should be left intact. This will allow for more community members to post proposals and for a faster community consensus, allowing for ideas the community decides are important to be implemented more quickly. At the same time a higher support threshold will ensure the community is aligned prior to any proposal passing.\n\n**Success**\n\nA successful implementation will create more activity on Snapshot with a wider array of proposals being suggested and voted on.\n\n**Execution**\n\nThe Stargate Foundation will contact Snapshot to lower the thresholds for Protocol proposals to the agreed upon amount (A 2.5% quorum threshold with a 60% support threshold). Once this is complete, an announcement will be posted in Discord to confirm the action has been taken.\n\n**Summary**\n\nStargate voting thresholds should be lowered to allow a wider array of people to post proposals for community voting. This will allow for a larger number of proposals to be posted and increased participation from the Stargate community.",

      "title": "SIP#21 Improved Depeg Protection",
      "content": "**Background**\n\nIn SIP#12 (https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0xe366d625a736b8f66e5c3fa640c538d37ff503d019460e9267d6c3a54fe09f98) a depeg protection module was introduced. This module sets parameters for depeg where if the stablecoin value is $0.9800 or lower for 30 continuous minutes OR if the stablecoin value reaches $0.9500 it is considered depegged and transfers are stopped.\n\nHowever, further protocol protection enhancements and guardrails are required to mitigate the risk of pool imbalances within Stargate Protocol arising from depeg scenarios. More specifically, under the current system, in the event of a slight stablecoin depeg (e.g., a depeg of greater than 10 basis points), Stargate Protocol can be arbitraged in a manner that creates greater pool imbalances, which in turn requires greater rebalancing effort (as demonstrated in SIP#19) (https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0xa040cd10e6b648014373e84569218937f986ca1ab11210ceb39e65c88cd005a3). \n\n**Solution**\n\nStargate should implement a new depeg protection module. This module will rely on the Chainlink Oracle on BNB Chain to provide a verified price for every coin within Stargate that is connected to a different asset. There would be three unique states within this module:\n\n- Normal State: The price is within 10 bps of peg ($0.999)\n- Drift State: The price is between $0.999 and $0.985\n- Depeg: The price is below $0.985\n\nWhen the module is in the Normal State the protocol functions normally. When the module is in a Drift state, the protocol adds the amount of depeg in basis points to the cost of the transfer. For example, if USDT is depegged by 12 basis points (It is at $0.988), an additional 12 basis point fee would be added to transfer USDT to any cross chain (different) asset that originates from the depegged token. Fees charged from this state would be sent directly to protocol owned liquidity to benefit Stargate. This would take away the ability for cross chain arbitrage to impact the protocol and allow the protocol to function in a more balanced way.\nWhen the module is in the depeg state, it will block all outbound messages from swaps where the depegged asset is trying to make a cross asset swap. As a result when it’s within this state, there is no ability for arbitrage to impact Stargate.\n\nWhen the protocol is in the Drift State or Depeg State, transfers to a depegged asset will function normally at a 1:1 ratio to enable users that want to bridge the other way to do so.\n\nAdditionally, it is proposed that cross asset swap fees be increased to 10 basis points total from 6 basis points total. This creates a barrier for toxic arbitrage and results in more protocol owned liquidity accruing to the Stargate Protocol.\n\n**Success**\n\nBy implementing this depeg module, Stargate protects Stargate LPs more thoroughly and creates a healthier protocol. Stargate also removes the ability for toxic arbitrage to imbalance the protocol making the liquidity within the protocol more usable. This will result in better flow of assets, more transaction volume and more protocol fees, helping build protocol owned liquidity and a healthier Stargate.\n\n**Execution**\n\nTo execute on this, contracts would need to be created to monitor Chainlink price feeds on BNB Chain and send a LayerZero messages under different conditions to update the FeeLibrary on all chains supported in order to charge more on swaps from depegged assets. All fees collected during the Drift State will be sent directly to protocol owned liquidity for the benefit of the Stargate Protocol.\n\nIf the depeg is less than 10 basis points, no message will be sent or a message will be sent to return the protocol to the normal state. \n\nIf the depeg is between 10 and 150 basis points, a message will be sent every 1 basis point, with the option of changing the threshold from 1-5 basis points, to update the fees that should be added to swaps from the depegged asset to other assets to protect the protocol. The range in basis points allows the protocol to adjust the depeg threshold if a lower basis point amount is too costly to a point where the cost of messaging outweighs the benefit the protocol will receive. \n\nIf the depeg is greater than 150 basis points, all messaging should be block from the depegged asset to other assets. \n\nThese messages will be incentivized by a publicly callable function in Gelato so anyone can help keep Stargate healthy.\n\nFinally, the FeeLibrary on all chains will be updated to price cross-chain cross-asset swaps at 10 basis points total to discourage toxic arbitrage.\n\n**Success**\n\nIf successful Stargate will be better protected against any asset within it depegging from other assets. Stargate will have a method to protect LPs in the event of a severe depeg as well as encourage balance within the protocol during all market conditions. ",

      "title": "SIP#20 Continued Balance and Rebalancing",
      "content": "**Background:**\n\nAs mentioned in SIP#19 Stargate functions optimally when all pools and paths are balanced. A state of balance is when there is the ideal state of stables on each side of a path.\n\nStargate has historically relied on the protocol charging fees when a path is out of balance and rewarding users for restoring that balance. The most recent update to this methodology was in SIP#10 (https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x9cefef89f475daaf6bc9c83244209c9d82d62ecbf16175a4a3ae5a1d3e1ff56a). The methodology should be updated to allow the protocol to more effectively maintain balance.\n\nBy better maintaining balance, Stargate will need less liquidity deposited to function, and in the future less emissions will be needed to support liquidity as a result.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\nThe protocol should change the conditions to receive eqReward from a minimum of 75% deficit in a pool to instead a minimum of 6 bps received in eqReward for a transfer. When this state is achieved, the protocol will instead lower all protocol fees to two (2) basis points. This cheaper flat fee will better incentivize partners to capture eqRewards and maintain balance within Stargate.\n\nStargate should also cap eqFee that accrues to eqReward at 50 basis points. Any eqFee that exceeds 50 basis points should accrue to protocol owned liquidity.\n\nA public API will also be developed for anyone to identify rebalancing opportunities to help keep the protocol healthy while capturing rewards for doing so.\n\nPath weighting should also be changed to have equal weights on each side of the path. This weighting will be updated periodically to be representative of transfer volume. This will allow more used paths to accept more volume while less used paths accept less.\n\nThe initial weighting will be set using historical data from the past 30 days excluding any data that is a clear outlier in the dataset. \n\nOnce these conditions are met The Stargate Foundation will, for a period of 6 months, rebalance the protocol to ensure protocol health. The community can pause this balancing effort at any point with an on-chain vote. If the balancing effort is voted to be pushed the foundation will deposit all funds into Stargate protocol owned liquidity.\n\nAll wallets the foundation uses for balancing will be published and linked within the protocol documents so all balances can be verified on-chain at any time. \nThe foundation will also publish a monthly balancing report outlining costs and profits captured to be added to protocol owned liquidity no later than 15 days after the end of each month.\n\n**Execution:**\n\nThe FeeLibrary contracts for all pools will be updated to change the thresholds for eqReward being triggered to reflect triggering when eqReward is greater than 6 basis points. It will also be updated to cap the eqReward for any single transfer at 20 basis points with any extra eqFee being sent to the Protocol Rebalancing Address.\n\nA public API will be developed to allow anyone to view opportunities to help keep the protocol healthy where rewards can be earned for doing so.\nPath weighting will be calculated based on the past 30 days of data to generate a starting balance and then updated periodically to reflect transfer volumes.\n\nNew wallets will be created and the addresses published for the express purpose of balancing. \n\nA monthly balancing update will be produced and shared with the community no later than 15 days after the end of each month.\n\n**Success:**\n\nSuccess is the protocol being able to maintain optimal balance by incentivizing a constant rebalancing effort. This will allow the protocol to function with less liquidity and rewards needed to incentivize this liquidity.\n\nLess liquidity allows for a higher turnover of liquidity which results in a higher amount of fees generated per dollar deposited and a more optimal function for the protocol.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nTo ensure optimal liquidity is maintained within Stargate changes will be made to the conditions to receive rewards better incentivizing users to help keep the system balanced.\n\nBy having a balanced system the protocol will be able to function with less TVL, warranting a future reduction of emissions and more revenue per dollar staked within the protocol.

      "title": "SIP#19 Protocol Balance",
      "content": "**Problem:**\n\nCurrently the Stargate protocol sits out of ideal balance due to stables accruing in pools on destinations due to different rates of transfer from various source chains.\n\nWhen a user bridges on Stargate, funds are deposited on the source chain and a corresponding amount of funds are removed from a destination chain. If these funds are not bridged back to the original chain, imbalance can exist within Stargate until those funds are returned.\n\nWhen imbalance exists, the protocol is not fully utilizing all of the liquidity within its system. This leads to smaller paths between some chains that in theory can result in an ability to transfer less stables through Stargate than would be otherwise possible.\n\nA perfectly balanced protocol allows full utilization of the protocol. This means that more volume can effectively transfer through Stargate, resulting in more fees accruing to POL and veSTG stakers.\n\n**Proposal:**\n\nThe Stargate Foundation proposes that it will manually rebalance all pools back to the optimal state to “reset” the protocol to optimal health. After this state is achieved, The Foundation will continually work to maintain protocol health while bringing forward a follow-up proposal to ensure the protocol is balanced in the future without the need for a large-scale balancing effort.\n\nThe Foundation will do this at no cost to protocol owned liquidity (POL) and any rewards captured while balancing will be added to the POL.\n\n**Success:**\n\nAfter a successful rebalancing effort is undertaken the protocol will have liquidity on each chain equal to the deposited liquidity. This will allow the protocol to function more efficiently.\n\n**Execution:**\n\nTo achieve a full rebalancing the FeeLibrary will need to be updated to whitelist a foundation address to do this rebalancing and allow it to ignore fees so it can efficiently transfer liquidity through Stargate. \n\n**Summary:**\n\nStargate operates as a protocol best when liquidity is optimally balanced. Currently the protocol sits out of ideal balance. The Stargate Foundation will manually reset the balance of the protocol to the ideal state and bring forward a proposal to ensure optimal balance is more effectively maintained in the future.",

      "content": "**Background:**\n\n\nIn June 2022, STG holders determined that transaction fees should be accrued to STG holders who stake their STG. To further implement this governance decision, governance should establish: (i) a methodology to determine the timing of fee accrual, (ii) a methodology for calculating fee accruals for each chain-address, and (iii) a fee claim process.   \nFor details regarding fee apportioning, see the previous [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x69c00cffab20a897469c4bdb04524dc6b31a167b3c0b11e5bea1269ae4ce9043).\n\n\n(i) & (ii) Timing & Calculation Methodology of Fee Accrual:\nveFee Calculation Constants\n- feeStartDate (UNIX) = 1654947275\n    - Timestamp of the initial veSTG [fee proposal approval](https://snapshot.org/#/stgdao.eth/proposal/0x69c00cffab20a897469c4bdb04524dc6b31a167b3c0b11e5bea1269ae4ce9043) on snapshot.\n- veFee Interval (in seconds) = 3600\n    - One hour\n- Monthly UTC start & stop timetamps\n    - Month start on first day of the month at UTC 00:00:00\n    - Month stop on last day of the month at UTC 23:59:59\n\nveFee Calculation Methodology\n\n1. At each interval within the month, calculate veSTG balances for each address.\n2. Over each hourly interval, calculate the fees accrued for veSTG stakers.\n3. With this data you should have the following for each hourly interval:\n    1. Individual veSTG balances at end of interval\n    2. Total veSTG balance at end of interval\n    3. veSTG fees accrued during interval\n4. Calculate individual veSTG fee accruals based on: veSTG Fees Accrued * (Individual veSTG Bal / Total veSTG Bal)\n5. Sum individual veSTG fees accrued over the month period for distribution.\n\n\n(ii) Proposal - Fee Claim Process:\nveSTG Fee Allocation & Collection Process\n- veSTG stakers will claim their rewards on the blockchain they’ve staked.\n- On the 10th of every month, the protocol will allocate the previous month’s reward for veSTG holders.\n- Rewards will be made in the token in which Stargate’s POL is the largest for that given chain.\n- After allocation, veSTG holders can complete a claim function by submitting the period of claim, formatted by by YYYYMM, i.e. 202207\n- The front-end should have a user-friendly interface that allows users to claim their pending fees.\n\n\n**Success:**\n\n\nThe above proposed collection method shall be implemented. STG holders that stake can claim veSTG rewards.\nExecution:\n\nThe redemption contract shall be implemented and audited with the claim functions available for veSTG holders to claim veSTG fee.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis proposal lays out a framework for how veSTG fees are calculated and distributed to veSTG holders. Fees are distributed to veSTG holders monthly. The actual distribution occurs on the 10th of every month based on the fees that were accrued in the previous month.\n",

Reaper has deployed a non-upgradable single strategy vault that only farms Aave.\n\n\nOn mainnet half of the current Curve pool would be deployed on Balancer with an 3x increase in swapping fee at 1% & start incentives with the same mandate on Aura as Convex. \n\nCreate another pool on Curve with a FRAXBP to make incentive more efficient.\n\n\n**Success**\n\nSuccess is determined by generating more revenues to the DAO\n\n**Execution**\n\n\nHave the multisig execute various txs to deploy PoL across all networks.\n\n- We make the pool, which can happen now.\n- Stargate migrates their POL\n- We collect Optimism fees monthly. After fees on STG/bb-rf-aUSDC are collected, 25% will be paired 1:1 with OP from our grant and returned via LM or bribing depending on which ROI is higher.\n- Stargate farms & chills\n\n**Time & Costs**\n\n\nBetween 1h to 2h\n\n**Summary**\n\n\nStargate deploy part of the PoL on Beethoven X - Curve - Balancer\n",

Fiat-collateralized / centralized stablecoins and algorithmic stablecoins present different use cases and have different risk characteristics. To provide greater diversification, FRAX, LUSD, sUSD, and DAI, should be added as new independent base assets to the Stargate Protocol, facilitating cross-chain transfers over Stargate.\n\nThe smart contract design and development required to support FRAX, LUSD, sUSD, and DAI transfers on Stargate should follow the below specifications:\n\n- Initially, the following chains should be supported:\n    - FRAX: Ethereum, Avalanche, Arbitrum and Optimism\n    - LUSD: Ethereum and Optimism\n    - sUSD: Ethereum and Optimism\n    - DAI: Ethereum, Polygon and Optimism\n- Only the liquidity pools on these chains will be connected to each other. More specifically, Stargate should not support cross-token transfers (i.e. FRAX <> USDC, sUSD <> USDT, etc) without further approval via governance.\n- Emissions should be enabled and provided to incentive approximately $5M of TVL per asset should be targeted. Emissions should be set for two months then follow in line with current schedules for other stablepools.\n\nPost launch, a range of transfer functionality to & from additional blockchains should be approved for new assets as demand grows (e.g, additional chains).",

This leads to a more inefficient use of capital.\n- Also, in this current scenario, once balancing transfers are completed the asset surpluses will be removed, and there is a likely chance that liquidity on these pools will now run in deficit, due to the removal of liquidity incentives.\n- Finally, it makes sense to have more consistent liquidity incentives on pools so that liquidity providers do not need to constantly move their allocations to and from pools.\n\n## Solution\n\nChange the TVL Incentivized Target formula to:\n- TVL Incentivized Target = Target TVL - POL\n\nThis update will increase capital allocation efficiency & create a more consistent incentive program for Stargate liquidity providers.\n\nLiquidity incentives will increase (if this were implemented in the previous month, projected STG emissions would have gone from ~408K STG to 458K STG), but this is needed to create long term efficiencies for the Stargate protocol.\n\n## Success\n\nSuccess is determined by creating more balance between Stargate liquidity pools, improving the price for Stargate transfers.\n\n## Execution\n\nUpdate the existing model to reflect the new formula for TVL Incentivized Target.\n\n## Time & Costs\n\nModel update: 1 HR\n\n## Summary\n\nStargate should update the formula for TVL Incentivized Target to improve credit allocation efficiency and to provide liquidity providers consistent incentives.",

      "title": "SIP #10 - Increase Incentive For Balancing Transfers",
      "content": "## Issue Statement\n\nThe Stargate pools are currently imbalanced, and there is not enough incentive to complete balancing transfers. Two key areas to address:\n- The eqRewards are currently distributed to all transfers when a source pool is in deficit, whether it’s a $1 or $1M transfer. Rather than subsidizing small transfers, these eqRewards should be reserved for significant balancing transfers. Additionally, eqRewards should be reserved for material deficits, accelerating growth on the eqFeePool.\n\n- The protocol should not charge 6 bps on balancing transfers. The protocol makes insignificant revenue on these balancing transfers, and the high hurdle rate of 6 bps significantly eats into a balancing transfer’s incentive. A quick breakdown:\n\n- To date, the protocol has generated $1.03M in baseline fees (both LP:4.5 bps & protocol: 1.5 bps)\n\n- Transfers from pools that are in significant deficit (Assets in Pool / Total Liquidity Provided <50%) to pools in surplus (Assets in Pool / Total Liquidity Provided > 100%) have generated $30K (~2.9% of revenue from baseline fees).\n\n- Transfers from pools in material deficit (Assets in Pool / Total Liquidity Provided < 60%) to pools in surplus have generated $41.5K (~4% of revenue from baseline fees).\n\n- This does not include the large opportunity cost due to an imbalanced system, which may easily exceed the 4% in protocol revenue.\n\n- Additionally, the protocol team should build out an API that allows the public to see a list of the active, profitable balancing transfers that are available within Stargate.\n\n## Solution\n\n### Implement a new eqRewards function\n\nNew criteria:\n- Assets in Pool / Total Liquidity Provided < 75 %\n- Transfer amount > 2% of deficit\n- Transfers eligible for eqRewards still receive their pro rata share of the eqFeePool based on the deficit filled (eqRewards = eqFeePool*(transferAmount/poolDeficit)\n\n### Phase out baseline fee for balancing transfers\nFirst, the protocol should define balancing transfers as all transfers that meet the following criteria:\n- The source pool is in material deficit:\n- Source Pool Assets / Source Pool Liquidity Provided < 60%\n- The transfer would not reduce the pathway balance below the intermediate reserve level of the pathways ideal balance:\n- currentPathwayBalance - transferAmount > Intermediate Reserve Level * idealPathwayBalance\n- Because the source chain does not know the state of the destination chain’s pools, the protocol should infer balancing transfers based on the state of the pathways.\n\nThere should be two baseline fee phase outs for balancing transfers:\n- Baseline Fee Phase Out 1\n- Criteria: A balancing transfer where Source Pool Assets / Source Pool Liquidity Provided is between 60% and 50%\n\nBaseline Fee: Original Baseline Fee * (1 - (.60-(Pool Assets/Pool LP))/.1)\n\n- Baseline Fee Phase Out 2\n- Criteria: Balancing transfer where Pool Assets/Pool LP < 50%\nBaseline Fee: 0 bps\n\n## Success\n\nSuccess would be measured by bringing more balance to Stargate’s unified liquidity.\n\n## Execution\n\nThe Stargate protocol team would need to update the Stargate Fee Library to reflect these changes.\n\n## Time & Costs\nDev work: 3-4 days\n\n## Summary\n- The Stargate protocol needs to increase the incentive for balancing transfers by:\nReserving eqRewards for true balancing transfers rather than subsidizing low transfer amounts\n- Phase out the protocol baseline transfer fee for balancing transfers\n",

      "title": "Value Accrual for STG Stakers",
      "content": "## Issue Statement\n\nThe community believes that $STG should start providing value accrual for holders who stake the tokens. This incentivises token holders to stake - and add further to the STG ecosystem. The community also believes that a higher allocation of the fee needs to go to POL. This should come from the fees that are currently accruing to Stargate LPers. Stargate LPers are currently incentivized through STG emissions. Allocating a larger portion of transfer fees to veSTG and POL is better for the protocol in the long run.\n\n## Solution\n\nBelow is the proposed updated fee structure for Stargate:\n\n* LP Fee: 1.0 bp\n    * If there are emissions on a pool, this 1 bp should revert back to POL.\n    * If there are no emissions on a pool, this 1 bp should go to LPs.\n* Partner Fee pool: .3 bp\n* veSTG holders: 1.0 bp\n    * This should only go to users that stake their STG for veSTG and should not accrue to sveSTG holders. \n* POL: 3.7 bp\n\nLP Fees: These will be allocated to LP pools at the time of transfer\n\nPartner Fee pool: Partner fees will be allocated to whitelisted partners that meet the criteria set by the Stargate protocol team. These fees will be distributed once a month. Whitelisted partners will receive their pro-rata share of the partner fee pool based on the transaction volume ($) sent to Stargate compared to the overall transaction volume derived from these whitelisted partners.\n\nveSTG holders: These will be distributed once a month.\n\nPOL: These fees will be allocated to POL at the time of transfer\n\n## Success\n\nSuccess means faster POL growth and new integrations due to the partnership incentives.\n\nSuccess can also be determined by the amount of STG staked and the length of staking. The community would hope for 15 million staked for a duration averaging 2 years as a goal.\n\n## Execution\n\nIf voted through - this work would need to be determined by the Stargate protocol team. This includes fee allocation to partners and veSTG holders.\n\n## Timeline & Costs\n\nAgain - depended on dev resources. This would need to be determined by the Stargate Protocol team.\n\n## Summary\n\n$STG needs to give holders utility and functionality for the token. This is a first step in doing so. Additionally, growing POL at a faster rate and clearly incentivizing partners to integrate Stargate are vital to the protocol’s success.",

The USDD team has followed [the template published in commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/stargatetoken/discussion/5085-apd-autonomous-pool-deployment) for completing this proposal.\n\n\n# Solution\n\n\n\n* The Stargate team will build the smart contracts to support USDD transfers on Stargate initially over Ethereum and BNB. Ethereum-USDD will allocate 100% of its liquidity to BNB-USDD, and BNB-USDD will allocate 100% of its liquidity to Ethereum-USDD:\n\n![Screen Shot 2022-05-26 at 8.22.10 PM.png](ipfs://QmQr2nnzDKqodNMrywLtiHfgpsYWrMfB6DmNhcyYvp6seN)\n\n* Only these liquidity pools will be connected to each other. Stargate will not support cross-token transfers with USDD (i.e. USDD &lt;> USDC, USDT, BUSD will not be supported).\n* Stargate will not initially provide liquidity incentives for these pools. The USDD team will provide the initial liquidity.\n* The Stargate team should have discretion in building new transfer functionality to & from additional blockchains for this asset as demand grows.\n* The USDD team will provide a minimum of $1M in USDD for each pool (Ethereum-USDD & BNB-USDD).\n\n\n# Success\n\n\n\n* Stargate protocol can support significant transaction volume through USDD, generating fees for the protocol.\n* Stargate receives integration adoption for applications looking to transfer USDD cross-chain.\n\n\n# Execution\n\n\n\n* Once the smart contracts are completed and deployed, this will need to be implemented in the back end and into the front end. Lists will need to be updated on respective networks to reflect the changes.\n* When other networks require the transfer functionality, the Stargate Team will facilitate this functionality.\n\n\n# Timeline\n\n\n\n* Initial Smart contract development: 3 days\n* Front end development: 1-3 days\n* Once the initial set up is in place by the team, it will be much easier and quicker to deploy new base assets.\n\n\n# Summary\n\n\n\n* The USDD team is proposing that Stargate support USDD transfers over Ethereum & BNB.\n* The Stargate protocol will not incentivize liquidity for USDD pools. The liquidity will come directly from the USDD team.\n* USDD cannot be transferred for other tokens within the Stargate protocol. Stargate will only support USDD&lt;> USDD transfers.\n* The USDD team will provide $1M in USDD liquidity on each pool (Ethereum-USDD and BNB-USDD)\n* The Stargate team has discretion to build out more functionality that supports USDD transfers on other chains.",

      "title": "SIP #5 - Ongoing Emissions Model",
      "content": "## Issue Statement\n\nThe methodology for determining Stargate Protocol’s emissions should be designed to obtain the requisite and optimal TVL to support bridging activity.  Based on data collected since launch and forecasts using such data, the current TVL and emissions are excessive and a structure that is data-driven should be adopted to ensure operational and capital efficiency.\n\nToday, emissions are incorrectly sized; TVL exceeds required liquidity needs for transactions, based on the data collected thus far. More specifically, as of the date of this proposal, Stargate’s TVL exceeds its needs by 210M-310M See [Refer to Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/stargatetoken/discussion/4846-liquidity-incentivization-program-other-related-proposal-updates) for further analysis.  \n\n\n## Solution\n\nThe goal: determine the STG emissions needed to incentivize sufficient liquidity to support transaction volumes while minimizing excessive emissions & preserving Stargate’s treasury.\n\nThis problem is solved in the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Determine each Stargate pool’s incentivized target TVL based on historical bridging data and current assets within the pool. This is the incentivized TVL needed to support ongoing bridging activity.\n2. Calculate Stargate’s historical pool APYs and blocktimes for each pool. These are required inputs for determining STG incentives (i.e. emission rates)\n3. Given target TVL, historical APY and blocktimes, solve for STG emission rates.\n\n\n### Calculate Incentivized Target TVL for Stargate Pools\n\nFirst, we'll create a Monte Carlo simulation, forecasting the net inflows/outflows for each pool over a 30-day period. We'll set the targeted TVL to the most severe net outflows over a 30-day sequence; we want to make sure the pools have enough liquidity to sustain the worst case scenarios. Once we have the target TVL for each pool, we’ll then take into account the POL and asset surplus/deficit within the pool to determine the incentivized target TVL (Incentivized Target TVL = Target TVL - POL - Asset Surplus/Deficit).\n\n### Calculate Historical APY & Retrieve Blocktimes\n\nFor each pool at each hour, we’ll calculate the annualized emitted value / current TVL to determine that hour's APY. We can then take the average APY over the previous 30 days to determine the pool's historical APY. We’ll also retrieve blocktimes for the past 90 days, using ethers.js.\n\n\n### Calculate STG Emitted Per Block\n\nWith our Targeted TVL & historical APY, and block times, we can calculate STG emitted per block using the following formula:\n\nSTG Emitted Per Block = Targeted TVL*Historical APY / forecasted blocks per year.\n\nMore detail on the model & calculations are provided below.\n\nModel implementation should be managed by the Stargate protocol team. The team working on this model should have discretion to remove outlier data values. For example, transaction volumes on May 12th exceed 4x the 7-day trailing average and distort model projections.\n\nAdditionally, the Stargate protocol team should have the ability to update STG emitted per block in the event block times change >10% from their latest forecasted value. Having this ability, the team can respond to emission fluctuations, like the fluctuations that have occurred on Optimism.\n\n\n## Success \n\n* The Stargate team updates emission parameters as outlined in the proposal.\n* The Stargate protocol has sufficient liquidity to support transfer activity while minimizing unnecessary STG emissions.\n\n## Timeline & Costs\n\n* Model tuning: 2-4 hours\n* Emissions updates: 2-4 hours\n",
