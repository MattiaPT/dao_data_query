      "title": "PDP19: Create a D2D Token Sink through SAFE Distribution",
      "content": "This proposal distributes 100,000 SAFE from the PrimeDAO Treasury based on the number of D2D burned over 2 weeks following a successful vote to reduce the circulating supply of D2D by 30-60%.\n\nBackground\nWith Safe Ecosystem Proposal 22 (SEP22) passing, the SAFE token has become transferable. PrimeDAO, through its early contributions to Safe in 2021-2022, became a SAFE guardian, receiving a total of 148,426 SAFE tokens. Half of the tokens unlocked immediately, with the other half vested over 4 years from TGE.\n\nThe main Prime Treasury currently holds 101,455 liquid SAFE with an approximate valuation of $2.5-$3.5 each.\n\nWhile rapidly shipping multiple D2D tools and gaining traction, PrimeDAO ran out of stablecoin runway at the end of 2022 while simultaneously entering a DAO winter. As a reaction, PrimeDAO went into turtle mode and has only spent $90K in stables since the start of 2023.\n\nNew opportunities\nThe DAO winter has passed, and with the rise of L2 ecosystems, new interest in DAO 2 DAO coordination is emerging. We believe it’s the right moment to accelerate PrimeDAO and focus on building the D2D coordination hub. PrimeDAO will focus 100% of its resources on the intersection of rating/deals while collaborating with partners and Prime spin-outs to facilitate other types of DAO services around PrimeDAO.\n\nOpportunity to exit D2D for current holders\nAs it’s not guaranteed that PrimeDAO will succeed in creating a solution that generates sufficient value to grow PrimeDAO, we suggest giving existing D2D holders the option to de-risk by burning their D2D tokens in exchange for a relative share of 100,000 SAFE from the PrimeDAO treasury.\n\nCurrent D2D distribution\nOn April 23rd, 2024, PrimeDAO still controls ~49,850,000 D2D tokens. This means approximately 50,150,000 D2D tokens are in circulation. To enhance alignment and coordination between D2D token holders and increase the % of D2D supply controlled by PrimeDAO (making it easier to engage in D2D deals) we believe PrimeDAO should create a D2D token sink using some of its SAFE tokens.\n\nProposal Breakdown\nWe propose to distribute 100,000 SAFE from the main PrimeDAO Treasury 2 based on the relative share of D2D burned (sent to 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead) over two weeks following a successful vote on this proposal.\n\nTimeline\nAfter the burn period of two weeks, a calculation will be made by the Prime Development Foundation - using the Advanced Filter function of Etherscan to count the number of D2D burned by each holder from the moment of this proposal passing - and the relative SAFE tokens will be streamed over 24 hrs to the addresses that burned D2D. PrimeDAO will use Sablier V2 to stream the tokens.\n\nAntiticapted effect\nAssuming SAFE trades at $2,5 at the moment of completion of this burning program, and D2D continues to trade at its current $0,0117 valuation, the burn program is anticipated to lead to approximately 21,3M D2D to be burned, equal to ~42% of the circulating supply of D2D. As the prices of SAFE and D2D can fluctuate in the coming weeks, it is estimated that anywhere between 30-60% of the circulating supply of D2D will be burned.\n\nAfter completion of the program, PrimeDAO’s holdings could look like:\n~55,000 SAFE vested over approx 2.5 years\n~50M D2D, equal to 63.5% of the total supply of D2D\n~150K in other tokens including Stables, ETH, BAL, PAL, GIV, GTC, and VITA.",

      "title": "PDP17: veD2D Tokenomics Upgrade ",
      "content": "This proposal outlines veD2D, a new tokenomics for PrimeDAO centered around the ve8020 launchpad by Balancer.\n\nBackground\nWhen PrimeDAO, a collective focused on researching and building next-generation coordination tools for decentralized organizations, launched $D2D in December 2021, it aimed to create a network token that would curate, build, and control a suite of DAO products and services.\n\nAfter building and incubating several products and services with various degrees of success, PrimeDAO’s initial funding from its H2 2021 Seed Round and LBP started to run out. In 2023, PrimeDAO continued to reduce its spending to a low in Q3 2023 while slowly exploring new products. Since then, on-chain activity has grown rapidly, and Prime contributors started building several products with PrimeDAO.\n\nFor Prime to progress towards its vision of becoming a headless brand that progresses DeFi towards a cooperative system - the $D2D token should play a more active role in curating and facilitating coordination. $D2D should make it attractive and rewarding for DAOs and teams to build and cooperate with PrimeDAO. The token should optimize for long-term, value-aligned contributions and governance that promotes cooperation.\n\nIntroduction to ve8020\nThe design is inspired by the existing tokenomics of Balancer and dozens of other projects, including AAVE and Radiant, which combines an 80/20 pool token with a Voting Escrow system to streamline governance, liquidity, and reward distribution.\n\nImplementing ve8020 will leverage the ve8020 launchpad by Protofire and Balancer, for which PrimeDAO was a designer partner and helped shape the solution.\n\nProposed veD2D parameters\n\nNetwork: Arbitrum\nThe veD2D system will run on the Arbitrum Mainnet, as this is the L2 with the most DeFi activity and has Balancer, Aura, StakeDAO and the veLaunchpad live on it.\n\nInput Token: 20% rETH / 80% D2D BPT or the staked equivalent.\n\nThe 20% rETH / 80% D2D BPT token will be used as an input token for veD2D. Using a Balancer Pool Token containing rETH, each veD2D holder contributes to making D2D liquid and receives Staked ETH rewards from rETH.\n\nMax Lock: 1 Year - Linear\nThe input tokens can be locked for a maximum duration of 1 year. The minimum lock duration is 1 week. veD2D power decreases linearly from the maximum lock duration. veD2D holders can increase their active lock duration at any point up to the maximum.\n\nEarly Unlock Penalty: Up to 50% - Linear\nEach veD2D holder can unlock the input tokens by paying an early unlock penalty of up to 50% of their input tokens based on the duration of their lock. The unlock penalty will be sent back to the PrimeDAO Treasury.\n\nUnlock All: Active\nPrimeDAO will have an Unlock All function active that allows Prime governance, ideally through oSnap, to unlock all veD2D simultaneously in case PrimeDAO wants to change its tokenomics in the future.\n\nReward Distribution: 80% of LP rewards + share of D2D inflation\nveD2D holders will receive 80% of rewards from the 20% rETH / 80% D2D pool and a relative share of D2D inflation. The 20% of LP rewards not distributed to veD2D holders will be used by PrimeDAO to increase its Balancer, Aura, and StakeDAO positions to reduce the costs of streaming rewards to the 20% rETH / 80% D2D pool. The D2D inflation should be voted on by PrimeDAO governance, deciding how much D2D shall flow to veD2D holders as a reward for their commitment and how much D2D will be used to bribe rewards to the pool.\n\nGovernance: PrimeDAO will continue to use Snapshot as its primary DAO voting solution. A new strategy fetching the current veD2D holdings will replace the existing ones fetching D2D holdings and LP positions. The new strategy will provide a more precise and transparent overview of PrimeDAO votes.\n\nThe proposal submission threshold would be raised to match the equivalent of 1M D2D worth of veD2D, while all other Snapshot parameters would remain the same.\n\nBenefits of veD2D\nWhen veD2D is implemented, it should bring various benefits to PrimeDAO stakeholders, including but not limited to the following:\n\nBetter value alignment between active stakeholders: By locking the 20% rETH / 80% D2D BPT tokens - Prime stakeholders commit to the growth of PrimeDAO and increase their skin-in-the-game, leading to more long-term alignment between contributors.\n\nImproved governance and vote reliability: By having only one active voting strategy, voting power is more accurately measured, making voting more transparent and predictable.\n\nA straightforward mechanism for Reward Distribution: veD2D creates a mechanism to reward active and long-term D2D contributors with, for example, D2D inflation rewards, product fee share, and potential retrospective rewards from spin-outs such as Inverter, SupremeDAO , and RegenerativeFi.\n\nRisks of veD2D\nThe potential risks introduced by veD2D are:\n\nAdditional Smart Contract Risk: By using Balancer Protocol and the ve8020 launchpad, additional smart contracts are being used by PrimeDAO. The Balancer Protocol contracts are extremely battle-tested and considered safe, while the ve8020 launchpad contains relatively little new code and is audited as part of the Balancer Grant.\n\nPotential impermanent loss: By utilizing the BPT as the input token, there is some risk of impermanent loss if the price of rETH and D2D diverges. Due to the 80 / 20 pool design, however, these effects are greatly minimized.\n\nTimeline and next steps\nThe audited version of the ve8020 launchpad is projected to be released in the last week of January. We aim to launch within four weeks of the launchpad going live. Due to the novelty of the smart-contracts, the transition to veD2D will be gradual.\n\nAfter the deployment of veD2D, PrimeDAO and Inverter will continue to iterate on the ve contracts and turn them into Inverter modules, as indicated in the Inverter Q1 proposal , to make the ve system more robust and flexible.",

The proposed deliverables include two key components: Back-end Inverter modules for Voting Escrow creation, decentralized governance, and rewards distribution, and user-friendly front-end Widgets for deployment and operation of veTokenomics for tokens, starting with $D2D.\n\nShort-term goals focus on implementing and extending the veD2D system in Q1, with long-term aspirations to expand these services to other DAOs and develop additional R&D and Liquidity services.\n\nPrime has immense experience in liquidity strategies, DAO2DAO and token operations, token issuance and distribution. Given this, we aim to;\n\nKickstart Prime’s plug-in library initiative by implementing $D2D token mechanisms utilizing the developed workflows in collaboration with Kolektivo Labs to:\nDogfood the designed veToken framework by implementing it for $D2D.\nEstablish a roadmap for the initial PoC development.\nCollaborate with Kolektivo Labs to research and design a veToken and oracleStake framework for $D2D token holders.\nResearch design requirements for a Prime staking program,\n\nResearch design requirements for a tokenomics plug-in library focused on the ve staking implementation requirements from Prime.\n\nHost at least three ve token mechanism design workshops for Prime’s new token program design, aims, research with Prime’s stakeholders. We aim to follow up on the workshops with external projects who have utilized ve mechanisms to learn the pain paints experienced and explore extending the workflows and widgets to other projects that aim to utilize ve based token mechanisms.\n\nDesign the initial workflow specifications based on the outcome of the initial research for design requirements.\n\nTotal budget requested for Q1, 2024:\n\nD2D: 1,500,000\n\nUSDC: N/A\n\n$D2D tokens will be used to provide liquidity to the D2D pools. Received $D2D tokens will never be sold to the market.",

Despite low activity currently, PrimeDAO holds various assets (tech, tokens, relationships) that can be re-activated at the right moment. As a DAO, each of the D2D stakeholders should have equal access to these resources and the governance of such.\n\nThis proposal discusses the option of pausing all but the Seed Contributor streams to further equalize the playing field between the 100s of contributors PrimeDAO has had over the past years and limit the circulating supply of D2D.\n\nProposal Breakdown\na) Pause all but the Seed Contributors’ Sablier token streams\n\nThis action would lead to canceling ~25 sablier streams associated with contributors who participated in Prime in 2020, 2021, and 2022 and, as a result, are receiving early team streams until October 1st, 2024.\n\nIn the future, PrimeDAO could decide to restart these vests.\n\nb) Move seed contributors’ vests to Sablier V2\n\nA new and better version of Sablier (a token streaming platform used for vests) is available. Re-deploying the seed vests on the V2 of Sablier will make it easier to manage these vests.",

      "content": "Since the beginning of the year the Launch squad has been working on developing and implementing the [Prime Growth Program](https://primedao.notion.site/Prime-Growth-Program-Handbook-5968262b1bd642e1b2eaa1b8993f62ad) to support ReFi projects by leveraging Prime’s ecosystem. The squad provides ongoing support to participating projects, connecting them to relevant mentors and stakeholders to help them grow.\n\nRead more about the program here: [Prime Growth Program Handbook](https://primedao.notion.site/Prime-Growth-Program-Handbook-5968262b1bd642e1b2eaa1b8993f62ad).\n\nWith the passing of [PDP14](https://forum.prime.xyz/t/pdp14-develop-and-implement-the-prime-badges-system-using-otterspace/253/3) to develop and implement the Prime Badges system using Otterspace, we want to explore its use in specific initiatives such as the Prime Growth Program.\n\nIn this proposal, we aim to implement Otterspace badges for project/incubatees, mentors, and other partners of the Growth Program, and establish a guild on Guild.xyz to manage access control and streamline stakeholder engagement and communication.\n\nThe Prime Growth Program Badges will be used to:\n\n* Attest to participation in the program, providing greater visibility and context to roles and relationships within it.\n* Control access to communication channels, workspaces, and events, using Guild.xyz.\n\nThe communication channel for each badge (e.g., Mentors Telegram group) will be used as the infrastructure for matching projects with mentors and other partners.\n\nImplementing these badges and the guild on Guild.xyz will enable us to better manage stakeholders, streamline communication, and support the growth of participating projects. We believe that this initiative will benefit both PrimeDAO and the projects that we support.\n\n**Prime Growth Program Badges:**\n\n1. **Growth Program Mentor**\n**Description:** Individuals who become advisors to projects and provide them with support in specific focus areas they have expertise in.\n**Qualification:** A *mentor agreement* signed through EthSign by a Prime Steward.\n**Duration:** Until the end of 2023.\n**Utility:** Access to Prime Growth Program Mentors Telegram group (Guild.xyz).\n\n2. **Growth Program Support Partner**\n**Description:** Organizations that provide paid services to projects, grant and incubation programs.\n**Qualification:** A *partnership agreement* signed through EthSign by a Prime Steward.\n**Duration:** Until the end of 2023.\nUtility: Access to Prime Growth Program Partners Telegram group (Guild.xyz).\n\n3. **Growth Program Incubatee**\n**Description:** Project participating in the program.\n**Qualification:** A *growth support agreement* signed through EthSign by a Prime Steward.\n**Duration:** No fixed duration - managed by PrimeDAO.\n**Utility:** Access to Prime Growth Program Community Telegram Group (Guild.xyz)\n\n---\n\nAuthor: Luiz Fernando | luizfernando@prime.xyz | @louizfe on Telegram and Twitter",

      "content": "In the Fall of 2021, PrimeDAO started working on Badges 2 as a solution to provide context to roles and relationships within a DAO.\n\nAn MVP which utilized ERC1155 token standards was developed in December 2021 and is primarily geared toward recognizing different types of contributors in a DAO. The tool was piloted by The DAOist, which uses it for the Governance of DAWN, their governing DAO.\n\nDue to budgetary constraints, the MVP of Badger was never progressed, and a full version is yet to be released. In the case of a new funding round, Badger development would have continued in Q3 2022; however, the market circumstances made this complex, and Prime had to decrease its spending aggressively. As a result, Badger had to be deprioritized further. At this time, more soul-bound token and badger-like projects started popping up. Prime engaged all of the different builder groups to evaluate which project shares the Prime ethos and product vision. The conversation with them developed further based on Otterspace’s focus on DAO operators, individual contributor recognition, and user-friendliness. Prime Contributors started drafting a vision on how to use the Otterspace technology for the better coordination of PrimeDAO.\n\nTo see the full details of the proposal please go to the link attached to this proposal.",

      "title": " PDP #013: Updating PrimeDAO voting framework",
      "content": "**Background & Motivation**\nSince its inception in November 2020, PrimeDAO has operated via a Two-Token system, where Governance was guided by a non-transferable reputation, measured with the [PrimeDAO Reputation token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x3ba4ECfb611c9694e7c35D3baf90aB137AFF137b), which was managed by PrimeDAO’s treasury through[ an in-house REP management safe module](https://github.com/PrimeDAO/contracts-v2/wiki/Reputation), instead of the [D2D Network token](https://etherscan.io/token/0x43D4A3cd90ddD2F8f4f693170C9c8098163502ad). The main reasons for using reputation > D2D in the early stage were 1. Separation of pure financial ownership vs. governance power 2. Allowing for reward flexibility as REP could be allocated separately from D2D, and 3. A better overview of governance participants.\n\nDue to new Governance tools and frameworks emerging (badges, zodiac, guild) and the increased distribution of the D2D token (approx 22M in circulation with 3M held by leading DAOs) - it’s come to a point where the Reputation system is likely not the best framework for stakeholder alignment and governance in PrimeDAO. This proposal aims to improve stakeholders' coordination in PrimeDAO by proposing governance framework and voting strategy changes.\n\nA. Remove the REP voting strategy from Snapshot and replace it with the [D2D](https://etherscan.io/token/0x43D4A3cd90ddD2F8f4f693170C9c8098163502ad), [D2D/USDC BAL](https://etherscan.io/token/0x27c9f71cc31464b906e0006d4fcbc8900f48f15f?a=0x311Cb5b8C61aC1d160E3D21a0390d9C1Fa64688E) (unstaked), [D2D/USDC BAL](https://etherscan.io/token/0x27c9f71cc31464b906e0006d4fcbc8900f48f15f?a=0x311Cb5b8C61aC1d160E3D21a0390d9C1Fa64688E) (staked), [D2D USDC SDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xfb1bfa535d1409726f97acdd790bd75d05dc85a8), [D2D USDC AURA](https://etherscan.io/token/0x07bd9b4a3e364cd4b3bb49035972af70b2e8961f), D2D/BAL strategy.\n\n**Actions**\n\n- The REP voting strategy, which currently has 19414 tokens in circulation with 146 holders, will be removed from [PrimeDAO’s snapshot.](https://snapshot.org/#/primexyz.eth)\n\n- The D2D voting strategy will be added to Snapshot, with each D2D being weighted as 1 PrimeDAO Voting Power (PVP).\n\nWith 9M+ D2D in Balancer pools, it’s important to ensure pooled tokens are eligible to vote. The following strategies will include Balancer LP tokens and locked LP tokens in different locations.\n\n- D2D/USDC on Balancer (unstaked): 1 = 1.319 PVP\nCalculation: 6,035,287 D2D/USDC in circulation with 7,957,978 D2D locked in this pool = 1.319\n\n- D2D/USDC on Balancer (staked): 1 = 1.319 PVP\n\n- D2D/USDC on Aura (staked): 1 = 1.319 PVP\n\n- D2D/USDC on StakeDAO(staked): 1 = 1.319 PVP\n\n- D2D/BAL on Balancer: 1 = 6.935\nCalculation: 6,035,287 D2D/USDC in circulation with 7,957,978 D2D locked in this pool = 1.319\n\nB. Update the voting duration to be more simple yet rigorous by updating Snapshot Settings\n\nSet the standard Snapshot proposal duration to 5 days with no fixed requirements in terms of proposal duration on the Discourse Forum.",

      "title": "Do we accept the Prime <> Aragon Strategic Token Swap",
      "content": "Summary\nAragon and PrimeDAO core contributors propose for voting to their respective tokenholder communities a strategic token swap. PrimeDAO is a collective that enables DAO2DAO coordination by building tools that turn DeFi into a cooperative game. This proposal is initiated as we acknowledge a strategic product and governance fit. The current DAO2DAO tools have valuable functionalities, such as decentralized token offering and token swaps, that align as an extension of Aragon’s future product. With this proposed token swap, both parties are able to converge their products and goals by actively participating in each other’s governance.\n\nBoth parties propose a swap of $50k in ANT to $50k in D2D.\n\nProposal rationale\nPrime DAO is a prominent name in the DAO ecosystem and would be a powerful ally in terms of a team with a proven track record of creating DAO tools that are both conceptually sound and provably useful.\n\nAragon is focusing on building smart contract infrastructure for on-chain permission management systems. Ultimately this infrastructure should be connected/extended by tools that enable DAOs to interact with external agents or assets. Connecting to functional modules and products such as the aforementioned ones developed by Prime DAO, is an essential element of scaling Aragon’s value proposition.\n\nBy plugging into Aragon’s ecosystem, PrimeDAO will benefit from Aragon’s wider reach and offer its modules to DAOs that might otherwise be unaware of its value propositions.\n\nThis proposal enables a stake in each other’s DAO, and therefore the two projects will have both the incentives and the means (through governance participation) to synchronize product evolution and coordinate better while they decentralize.\n\nAbout Aragon\nAragon has been building governance and DAO infrastructure since 2017. To date over 1300 on-chain organizations including Lido and many other leading web3 projects have been enabled by Aragon’s tooling. Leveraging product, brand, expertise, and a well-capitalized treasury Aragon aims to solidify its role at the frontier of web3 infrastructure. As Aragon will start its own transition to a DAO at the end of this year the project is looking to actively utilize its treasure by becoming involved in meta governance of projects in its ecosystem\n\nExecution Details\nBoth parties propose a token swap of $50k in ANT to $50k in D2D.\n\nThe amounts of ANT and D2D tokens correspond to the $50k value and will be calculated based on a 7-day backward-looking TWAP (time-weighted average price) taken at the time this vote is published to the respective voting infrastructure of each of the two communities.\n\nThe following terms are proposed for the strategic token swap:\n\n6 months, soft lock-up period (token lock-up not enforced on-chain but on a social level)\nDue to the soft lock, full voting power will be granted immediately upon closing of the sale\nTerms are symmetric for both parties",

      "content": "The Prime Rating workstream is building and growing the Rating product. With the recent decision to spin-off Rating as it's own independent organisation, the team started exploring requirements and first focusing on the financial part. As a first step, we started to apply for grants to provide the basis for Rating to thouroughly plan and conduct the spin-off. However, until other sources of funding become a reality, we ask PrimeDAO to further support the Rating product in it's efforts to become fully financially independent from the \"mothership\".\n\nTotal budget requested for the time period of July & first 2 weeks of August:\n\n    USDC 42k\n    D2D 18.7k\n\nMore details on the budget and the plans can be found in the forum -> https://forum.prime.xyz/t/prime-rating-july-august-budget-proposal-usd-58-3k/204/10\n",

      "content": "This proposal is a follow up to PDP12 - Prime Token (Re)Launch and aims to validate the proposed updates to the Early Contributor reward distribution as proposed by the Migration Squad, who is leading the transition from the old PrimeDAO Token (PRIME) 1 to the new Prime (D2D) token.\n\nFollowing the completion of the Prime Seed in September 2021, the transition to the new D2D tokens was started. Up to 5% of the D2D token supply was set aside for Early Contributors - rewarding those that hold the old PrimeDAO token & supported PrimeDAO early on.\n\nUpdates\nThe following updates to the methodology outline are being proposed:\n- Remove addresses that don’t hold any PRIME or REP from the D2D bonus calculation. Proxy addresses connected to an address that does hold PRIME or REP will be included. This will ensure that bonuses are only allocated to current PrimeDAO stakeholders. The excluded bonuses will be sent back to Prime Treasury for future distribution.\n- Raising the airdrop threshold from 1,000 D2D to 10,000 D2D - this means that rewards under 10,000 will be airdropped as soon as the updated proposal passes. D2D rewards above 10,000 will be vested for a period of 3 months using Sablier. This change lowers the number of Streams to be deployed from 162 to 52.\n- Not starting with heavy D2D liquidity rewards after distribution, instead of waiting for the Prime Tokenomics update planned for Q2 to be rolled out for a more effective distribution method.\n- Proxy addresses will be merged with their owners\n- Swapping in Prime Swap has been removed as a reward metric as this turned out extremely hard to calculate for a small amount\n- Addresses that are eligible to receive less than ten (10) D2D will not receive their airdrop, the costs of sending these tokens does not add up to the value created by it.\n\n\nFinal numbers\n\nTotal to be distributed: 3,432,974 D2D\n\n2,569,974.30 will be distributed to addresses that held PrimeDAO tokens during both snapshots (July 1st, 2021 and October 14th, 2021) and 1,033,000 to early users and contributors.\n\nIn total PrimeDAO had set aside up to 5,000,000 D2D tokens for the migration, this means 1,567,026 D2D tokens will remain in the PrimeDAO Treasury.\n\nThe migration squad has put in a lot of effort to ensure all early contributors are rewarded equitably. If an owner of an address feels that his rewards are not adding up to their contribution, we suggest having a discussion on the forum. PrimeDAO will not be able to revert this calculation after approval. Any request will have to be made on a per case basis to PrimeDAO.\n\nForum posts for refference\n- https://forum.prime.xyz/t/prime-tokenomics-v2-migration-and-retrospective-rewards/64\n- https://forum.prime.xyz/t/early-contributor-d2d-distribution-sheet-confirmation/123/2",

      "content": "As posted on the Prime Forum: https://forum.prime.xyz/t/prime-symmetric-partnership-draft/119/3\n\nPartnership Purpose\nThe partnership aims to set the foundation for a long-term collaboration between PrimeDAO and Symmetric. The two organizations aim to integrate on a technical and operational level to bring a top-class flexible DEX and Launch experience to Celo and Gnosis Chain.\n\nBackground on the Partnership\nPrimeDAO and Symmetric have been in touch since Q3 2021 when a group of Prime contributors involved in the Kolektivo project on Celo was researching what it would take to bring Balancer V2.0 on to Celo. After meeting with the Balancer and Celo team, it became clear that Balancer would not move to the Celo chain in the short term. Around this time the Prime contributors bumped into Symmetric and started a conversation to explore whether it would be possible to collaborate instead of making competing products.\n\nAt this point, Symmetric was live for a couple of weeks with a fork of Balancer V1.0 on Celo and Gnosis Chain. The Prime and Symm contributors met to discover synergies and started researching what it would take to move Symmetric from Balancer V1.0 to Balancer V2.0. After scoping out what it would take to, Prime supported in making introductions and kick-starting conversations to gather the resources needed for Symmetric to start the migration to V2.0.\n\nDuring the same time, Balancer started exploring the so-called Balancer Friendly Fork model, where third-parties teams would receive BalancerDAO’s recognition and support to launch on a chain where Balancer doesn’t aim to launch in the short-term. As Prime’s contributors are well-connected with the BalancerDAO, conversations have been started to recognize Symmetric as the official Balancer Friendly Fork on Gnosis Chain and on the Celo Network.\n\nMeanwhile in Q4 PrimeDAO launched the Prime Launch and Prime Rating dApps. Prime Launch is a platform for hosting seed or LBP launches on Ethereum Mainnet and Arbitrum and aims to be the starting point for new DAOs. Prime Rating is a community and framework of research that creates reports on the leading DeFi projects.\n\nThere is a clear synergy between the Prime and Symmetric team and products that we would like to leverage through a close partnership. The partnership proposal will outline how we can align our incentives and bundle our forces to bring a valuable offering to Celo and Gnosis Chain.",

We will be in Sync with Jahed from PrimeDAO, who is the Marketing Lead, as accountability for connections and potential opportunities. We will travel on separate days but our stay will encompass days between February 15 to February 20.\n\nThe cost breakdown can be found on the forum post. ",

      "content": "Background\nAs we move forward with our PRIME ($D2D) token launch, we want to signal our intent to make PrimeDAO a DAO co-habitation space by sharing ownership and securing long-term alignment with DAOs we will be closely working with. So, we are hoping to do token swaps with our strategic partners.\n\nSummary\nAfter discussions with the Olympus Partnerships contributors - PrimeDAO seeks to partner with Olympus asking for a swap of $250k in OHM - in return for 500k Prime Tokens (0.5% supply). Olympus would join Gitcoin and Balancer - who are partnering with PrimeDAO on similar terms.\n\nMotivation\n\nOlympusDAO is one of the DAOs we have been in close contact with, as we integrated some of the Olympus DAO contributors’ valuable feedback into our process for researching and designing Prime Deals.\n\nDuring these interactions, we have come to realize an exceptional alignment between Olympus and PrimeDAO: PrimeDAO’s product suite offers collaboration as service, and Olympus offers service as collaboration in its quest to evolve into an ecosystem-wide behemoth for advanced treasury management. In theory, there is no limit on how many DAOs can be integrated into Olympus’ D2D partnerships which span incubation, co-liquidity provision, OlympusPRO, token swaps, and many more to come. However, there is a limit to how many partnership pipelines the Olympus team can handle. PrimeDAO helps Olympus to scale its operational capacity by making the whole experience of negotiating and venturing with other DAOs a lot more efficient in multiple layers. On PrimeDAO’s side, partnering with Olympus would allow PrimeDAO to onboard the DAOs in Olympus’ ally network into its services.\n\nOlympus receiving Prime tokens will allow it to have a say over Prime’s governance from day one. It will also enable us to coordinate in a more aligned and intimate setting, giving each other a concrete representation to voice our needs as we iterate on our products moving forward.\n\nThere are a large numbers of areas we see for collaboration with Olympus as we roll-out - including:\n\nOlympus <> Prime Deals\n\nHave Olympus participate in the testing phase of token swap on Prime Deals, and if both parties agree, onboard Olympus on to Prime Deals for their future token swaps.\nCreate an open deal template customized for negotiating the Olympus Pro applications.\nWork with Olympus to integrate a sorting mechanism that allows for sorting the Pro applications based on a set of parameters.\nEnable $OHM holders to signal their preference over the Pro applicants whitelisted by Olympus.\nOlympus <> Prime Launch\n\nEnable $OHM/$gOHM into shortcut assets for DAOs to choose which asset to raise funds with.\nOnboard Olympus into Prime Launch’s seed module, whereby Launch facilitates the transactions with the incubated partners.\nOnboard Olympus and their incubated projects to Prime Launch for launching their projects.\nSynchronize Prime Launch’s selection process of onboarding DAOs into the seed module with applying to Olympus’ Incubation program as sequential phases of building up to the launch.\nOlympus <> Proposal Inverter\n\nWork with the Olympus team to integrate Tyche with Proposal Inverter so that the Olympus community can coordinate around which initiatives to direct fundings to\nEnable a novel method of funding public goods for the Olympus community and benefit from potential retroactive airdrops.\nSupport Building up to the Prime Token Launch\n\nIntroduction to the Olympus Community\nAdvice and assistance when needed from the Olympus team\nBootstrapping Liquidity for D2D\n\nUse of Olympus’ upcoming liquidity products to bootstrap our initial liquidity.\nUse of Olympus Pro to be able to own our liquidity.\nOnboarding $OHM into the Balancer Ecosystem\n\nAs a partner of both BalancerDAO and OlympusDAO, PrimeDAO will play an active role in bridging liquidity between the two protocols.\nBuilding a deep liquidity between D2D <> OHM <> BAL to allow LBPs to be able to select OHM as an efficient bootstrap asset and open up additional LaaS opportunities.\nConclusion\nOur partnership will set the stage for a strong collaboration between Olympus and Prime as we work towards becoming the primary coordination stream for DAOs. OHM wants to be the liquidity bridge/backend of the whole ecosystem. Olympus can utilize PrimeDAO as a coordination vehicle in calling a DeFi alliance and to strengthen the plasticity of ecosystem liquidity. By partnering with PrimeDAO, Olympus will be a leading voice in the creation of DAO2DAO products that enhance its offering and deal making mechanics, while supporting PrimeDAO’s push towards becoming a DAO co-habitation space.",

      "content": "Partnership Purpose\nThe partnership aims to align the interest of the parties to intensify the collaboration between the organization. With PrimeDAOs relaunch, it seeks to further commit to the building on the Balancer Protocol and supporting the decentralization and development of the BalancerDAO.\n\nThe current Prime product suits, consisting of Prime Launch (LBP interface), Prime Rating (research sub-DAO), Prime Pools (DAO governed Balancer Pools) and Prime Deals (Interface for DAO agreements) aim to provide substantial value to BalancerDAO and aligned DAOs.\n\nBackground on the Partnership\nThe relationship between BalancerDAO and PrimeDAO goes back to Q4 2020. Since the launch of PrimeDAO in November 2020, the Balancer protocol has played a crucial role in the PRIME ecosystem. Initially coined the Prime LP Manager, PrimeDAO has governed all parameters of its main liquidity pool on Balancer, existing of 20% ETH and 80% PRIME via the PrimeDAO’s initial governance mechanism (Alchemy by DAOstack).\n\nIn Q1 2021, PrimeDAO set out to revamp the LBP experience for users and project teams alike after an uncomfortable experience with another launch product. Through a grant from Balancer Labs, the development of what is known as Prime Launch started. Prime Launch allows anyone to bootstrap a token without needing to write a single line of code. The product provides a crisp and user-friendly interface, support, and ecosystem of service providers that will enable the best decentralized launch experience (going live on December 13th, 2021).\n\nWith the development of Prime Launch, PrimeDAO became a Balancer v2 launching partner, and the collaboration extended to active technical and organizational development. In Q2 2021, Balancer and PrimeDAO made headlines by starting BLxPR, the first DAO2DAO pool, a shared liquidity pool between Balancer and PrimeDAO.\n\nSince then, the teams have continued to work together, and various PrimeDAO contributors have supported the development of BalancerDAO and the Balancer Protocol.\n\nAfter successfully re-branding and raising seed funds, PrimeDAO has grown to over 30 full-time contributors and is ready to launch its product suite and solidify relationships with aligned DAOs. Some of the DAO that have recently partnered include DeFI Safety and Gitcoin.\n\nCommitment of the Organizations\nBoth parties agreed that they intend to contribute the following towards this partnerships:\n\nD2D Collaboration\n\nPrimeDAO’s primary aim is enabling D2D collaborations and shares this vision with Balancer. PrimeDAO will support the development of the BalancerDAO and, where possible, share learnings and resources with BalancerDAO.\nBalancerDAO will get early access to Prime Deals , an Interface for DAO to DAO interactions, such as token swaps co-liquidity provision, and joint venture formation, to give input, to ensure the product serves the needs of BalancerDAO.\nTechnical\n\nPrimeDAO will continue to host Balancer LBP through Prime Launch and support the development of LBPs on Balancer.\nPrimeDAOs builders will continue to support the development of the Balancer Protocol.\nPrimeDAOs will support the development of the Balancer Protocol on alternative blockchains, currently evaluating the deployment of Balancer V2.0 on Celo and xDAI chain in collaboration with Symmetric, with the potential for it to develop into a Balancer Friendly Fork.\nOperational\n\nBoth DAOs will actively share DAO operational learnings and workflows, starting with a bi-monthly knowledge-sharing session covering three topics relevant to both DAOs. The first session will be organized in mid-January.\nMarketing\n\nTo ensure both entities will profit from each other’s reach and marketing or sales activities, we will do co-branded communication & services where applicable.\nCo-liquidity provision:\n\nTo align governance interests, between the two organizations, the creation of a co-liquidity pool is proposed with the following details; 25,000 BAL from the Balancer Ecosystem Fund would be transferred to PrimeDAO at the end of PrimeDAO own LBP to bootstrap a PRIME / BAL pool with 50/50 weights and 2,5% trading fees. Right after the conclusion of the PRIME LBP, PrimeDAO will seed a pool with the 25,000 BAL and match it with the same $ value in Prime. Once the pool is initiated, PrimeDAO will transfer 50% of the Balancer Pool Tokens to the Balancer Ecosystem Fund to complete the transaction.\nThe pool will again be called the Balancer <> PRIME pool (BLxPR) and function as a liquidity bridge between the two DAOs. The BLxPR pool will be one of the two main liquidity pools for PrimeDAO.\n\nGovernance\n\nThe BLxPR token will be added to the Snapshot strategies of both DAOs to allow BLxPR token holders to participate in the Governance of both protocols.\nA new snapshot will be set-up with the BLxPR as the governing token. This snapshot will be used to govern issues related to this DAO agreement.\nPool Optimization\n\nPrimeDAO aims to create deep liquidity between BAL <> PRIME to be able to bring more projects and liquidity to the Balancer Protocol. PrimeDAO aims to do this by actively engaging in D2D agreement with other DAOs and creating PRIME / xxx pools on the Balancer Protocol .\nPrimeDAO also aims to leverage the various upcoming Balancer Pools in combination with PrimeDAOs existing products. Prime Rating could potentially be utilized to create research-driven managed pools and Prime Deals could be connected to the Balancer Protocol to allow multiple DAOs to bootstrap a pool together in a completely permissionless way.",

      "title": "Partnership Agreement Gitcoin <> PrimeDAO",
      "content": "Background\nWe want to turn DeFi into a cooperative ecosystem. While we are building these DAO2DAO products and services, we are paving the way for these interactions by dogfooding PrimeDAO itself into a headless brand— an open value network that builds effective organizational coordination tools to secure the collective future of DAOs all over the world.\n\nWe want to establish PrimeDAO as a hub for DAOs to come together and co-build DAO toolings and services. We have seeded this vision in our culture by collaborating with DAOs across multiple phases of researching, designing, and developing our products.\n\nAs we move forward with our PRIME ($D2D) token launch, we want to signal our intent to make PrimeDAO a DAO co-habitation space by sharing ownership and securing long-term alignment with DAOs we will be closely working with. So, we are hoping to do token swaps and mutual grant agreements with our strategic partners.\n\nSummary\n\nThis proposal, if passed, would grant Gitcoin $250K USD worth of PrimeDAO’s $D2D governance token at a price of $0.50 per token for a total of 500K $D2D coins, equating to 0.5% of Prime DAO treasury, and grant PrimeDAO $250,000 USD worth of $GTC.\n\nThe purpose of this alliance is to help ensure that Gitcoin and Prime can work together to build tooling for DAO2DAO coordination.\n\nMotivation\n\nGitcoin’s vision is to upgrade society’s capabilities to coordinate - with the hope of defeating coordination failure altogether.\n\nThe next frontier of coordination is DAO-to-DAO interaction. For a D2D ecosystem to flourish, it needs proper tooling to support new ways for DAOs to experiment with collaboration and joint ventures.\n\nAs a DAO of DAOs, Gitcoin is already a hub for inter-DAO coordination. It’s a natural home for R&D of coordination tools, including mechanisms like Quadratic Funding, that have already impacted the entire web3 space.\n\nWe see this relationship complementing Prime in the following ways:\n\nEnabling Gitcoin and PrimeDAO to have a direct stake in each other’s future direction\nStrengthening ties between and improving the shared bandwidth of Gitcoin and Prime teams\nCollaborating on building DAO 2 DAO tooling to usher in the next era of coordination\nBenefiting from the expertise in coordinating public goods funding of the Gitcoin community\nSpecification\n\nThe passing of this proposal would transfer $250,000 USD worth of $GTC to 0x567d220B0169836cBF351DF70A9c517096ec9De7, PrimeDAO’s specified Treasury address.\n\n500K $D2D, a 0.5% allocation, would be transferred to 0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6, Gitcoin’s multisig address for easier delegation / voting.\n\nUse of Funds\n\nTo ensure long-term alignment, Prime DAO will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the Gitcoin ecosystem.\n\nTo ensure long-term alignment, Gitcoin will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the Prime DAO ecosystem.",

      "content": "The proposal inverter must be built. This has been made clear by the many DAOs calling for its creation, including PrimeDAO. This will be a beneficial collaboration between Longtail Financial, Token Engineering Commons, Commons Stack, BlockScience, Curve Labs, and PrimeDAO. \n\n The ‘Proposal Inverter’ is a high-demand DeFi component since the inception of the DAO ecosystem. It was documented in the original Commons Stack work as the ‘giveth proposal engine’. More recently, it has been written about in collaboration with BlockScience and PrimeDAO in ‘Exploring DAO2DAO Collaborations’ https://medium.com/primedao/exploring-dao2dao-collaboration-mechanisms-c37218a17a21   \nThe proposal inverter inverts the DAO-proposal relationship. Such that, instead of having many proposals for a single DAO, we will have many DAOs for a single proposal. This enables the collaborative funding of proposals that benefit multiple DAOs throughout the ecosystem. You can think of this as solving the byzantine general's problem for the collective funding of public goods for DAOs.\n\n\nThe specifications and modelling development is happening publicly through the Token Engineering Commons Lab. The lab has an open development session every Friday 9amPST/6pmCEST in the TEC discord. Longtail Financial is pooling additional development resources towards the modelling and spec. BlockScience is providing advisory, particularly through Dr.Z’s Open Research Office Hours and the previous iterations of modelling that have been done on the topic. \n\n\nNote that this proposal is for the creation of the Proposal Inverter specification and cadCAD model. After the completion of the spec and model, smart contracts must be developed, which may be a future proposal. It has been indicated that Curve Labs has the resources to develop the contracts upon completion of the spec and model.\n\n\nRequesting: 35k USDC + 35k Prime Tokens\n\nSent to: 0x8C6e8021de64150BF374640Eaf7732542D93aEb8  \n\n07/30/2021 to 10/18/2021",
