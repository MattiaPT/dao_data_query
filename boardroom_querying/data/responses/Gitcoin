Future proposals will be submitted with specifics about how they will be allocated.\n______\nWhy do this?\n\n1 - Because Gitcoin needs to become (a) more successful in the market + (b) more DAO-like.\n2 - This direction is already proven at small scales + therefore significantly derisked (just look at the chart above).\n3 - Gitcoin has 24.5m GTC 1and ~50(ish) months left of runway at current market levels. Our data above shows that the rest of the GTC should be spent WAY MORE on Citizens. This is a test of that direction. And a disruption of the current implicit status quo of that $$ being earmarked for Grants Lab.\n4 - This is a true pilot for creation of the Gitcoin Citizens Value Flows 4.\n\nImplementation Details\n\n1 - [Grants Lab] Allo Kit, Allo 2.1 to be built by Grants Lab before Devcon\n2 - [Grants Lab] Grants Lab leaders are rebuilding the Grants Lab product organization after the move to multi-mechanism (and the move from Grants Stack to Allokit + similar tools) created some talent turnover.\n3 - [DAO] Kevin + other Gitcoin stewards to explore how to create long term economic partnerships with Allo builders.\n4 - [DAO] We ALL become live players 1 + build Gitcoin 2.2 together.\n5 - [Foundation] Mathilda is currently stewarding Gitcoin Citizens. We all need to rally around & empower her to be successful in navigating forward!

      "content": "TL;DR:\nRemove current community multisig signers from the gitcoin.eth multisig.\nAdd two new community members as multisig signers.\nAlign with Gitcoin’s commitment to decentralization and community stewardship.\nContext & Rationale:\nThe Gitcoin Grants program has consistently emphasized the importance of decentralizing fund management to empower community members. One core mechanism that supports this decentralization is the governance over the matching pool funds held within the gitcoin.eth multisig.\n\nCurrently, it’s procedure to include two community members as signers on this multisig, chosen by Gitcoin to act as trusted community stewards for the matching pool funds. However, to maintain transparency, and ensure broad representation, we regularly rotate the signers and bring in new community representatives.\n\nProposal:\nWe propose to:\n\nRemove the current community multisig signers from gitcoin.eth to ensure the periodic rotation of responsibilities and avoid any accumulation of influence by a single group over time.\nJanine Ledger\nAnnika Lewis\n\nAppoint two new community members as multisig signers, selected based on their active involvement in the Gitcoin community and commitment to stewarding public goods.\n@wasabi\n@ZER8\n\nThe new signers are both active longtime members within the Gitcoin community and have served on the GG Community Council since April 2024. They will be empowered to manage the multisig, alongside the existing Gitcoin contributors’ signers, in a way that ensures the security and appropriate allocation of the matching pool funds.\n\nConclusion:\nRotating the gitcoin.eth multisig signers is a critical step in ensuring the ongoing decentralization and transparency of Gitcoin’s matching pool fund management. By refreshing the signer pool with new community representatives, we reaffirm our commitment to putting the community at the center of decision-making processes.\n\nVote\nI would like to have us vote to remove and add the above mentioned community members as multisig signers.\n\nRemove two existing community members as multisig signers, and add two new community members as signers.\nDo not remove two existing community members and no not add two new community members as signers.\nAbstain.",

      "title": "Delegate Gitcoin’s GloDollar to fund public goods via GloDollar",
      "content": "Following community discussions and previous successful collaborations with the Glo Consortium, we’re proposing to delegate our existing $100K worth of GloDollars specifically for funding public goods. This proposal aligns with our mission to utilize decentralized finance tools for societal benefit.\n\nYou can find the original proposal here. Thanks to @garm @jengajojo and @CoachJonathan for support on drafting this update.\n\nWe propose the delegation (in this case referring to donating the yield) of GloDollars to directly fund chosen public goods using Glo Dollar 2.0 4. This proposal does not directly fall within our core operations of financial diversification but is in harmony with our broader mission to fund impactful initiatives. The unique mechanism of GloDollar allows our community to engage in Public Goods Funding passively, while continuing our mission directly.\n\nA quick recap - Understanding GloDollars, Public Goods Funding and Gitcoin’s Participation: \nTL:DR GloDollars generate yield through the earnings on reserves backing the stablecoin. With Glo Dollar 2.0, this yield is automatically directed to fund public goods and charities—a process GloDollar term’s “Automatic Public Goods Funding” (AutoPGF).\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\n-- The reserves that back GloDollars generate a financial return. These reserves are managed to ensure stability and profitability.\n\n-- Through AutoPGF, the yield from GloDollars within the \"Web3 Public Goods” is allocated to various charitable causes which are: Gitcoin, Giveth and Protocol Guild. GloDollar holders can influence where this yield is directed via the GloDollar platform, choosing from a range of public goods and charities. Read more here 2.\n\n-- The term “delegate” is used to describe the process whereby GloDollars are allocated to generate yield that is then directed towards funding public goods. Delegating GloDollars does not involve transferring ownership or voting rights. Instead, it involves directing the financial benefits (yield) generated by these stablecoins to support chosen causes, without the need to donate the tokens themselves. For more detailed insights, you can visit GloDollar’s recently published page: How We’re Funding Public Goods 2.\n\nUpon approval, we will proceed to work with GloDollar to manually delegate the amount of GloDollars in the matching pool to fund public goods for a period of 12 months from the funds sitting in the multi-sig. At the end of this 12 month period, as per the initial agreement - we can choose to keep the funds or initiate the swap back for $100K USDC to the Matching Pool after the delegation period.\n\nWe are committed to transparency and will keep the community informed about significant developments regarding our GloDollar activities. We value your input and engagement, which are crucial in steering our collective efforts toward the most meaningful impacts.\n\nYes: Approve the delegation of GloDollars for the funding of public goods.\n\nNo: Do not proceed with this delegation.\n\nAbstain: Choose not to vote on this proposal.",

      "title": "H2 Proposal [Budget] - Grants Labs",
      "content": "This budget proposal is a follow up to the Grants Lab H2 Strategy, posted earlier this week: H2 Proposal [Strategy] - Grants Labs 3\n\nThis budget proposal covers H2 2024 (July - December.) We want to be lean, but not hungry, with our overall budget. We have trimmed down expectations for travel and miscellaneous expenses for H2 2024. We only have two anticipated new hires, a Principal Engineer and a Social Media Manager. We expect to cease hiring for the next 6+ months after the positions are filled – we have put a huge effort into filling key leadership roles at the start of this year, exiting folks who are not aligned with our talent bar or mission, and now have the resources we need to succeed.\n\nHeadcount:\n\nWith the wind-down of the Ecosystem Collective, we are moving RPP (Owocki, two engineers, and EA) into Grants Lab to create more coordination between engineering, embrace our multi-mechanism future, and more holistically resource our bets. We are also retaining a Brand Manager on the marketing team and filling the needed social role above which is left vacant with the ECC spindown. This accounts for the headcount budget increase of ~$85k/mo.\n\nAdditionally, you’ll see a severance line item for July. As part of our ongoing efforts in building the right team this year, we gave all Grants Lab contributors the opportunity to opt into the next chapter or choose a severance package and opt out. This is a common tactic at organizations that are undergoing cultural or strategic shifts like we have. Two of our 18 contributors opted out; we’re grateful for their contributions and wish them the best.\n \n![1.png](ipfs://bafkreigfaljg63q3ioporpxeiznqpcz4wu6vjoo6oonlwwnesrttsv62ya)\n    \n\nConsultants:\n\nThis line item will rise substantially for Q3 and remain higher in Q4. The primary driver of this is our retention of Wonderland at $40k/mo for engineering and protocol leadership. We’re really excited about the quality of talent that they bring to our protocol and dev tools effort. Additionally, working with Wonderland provides us flexible engineering capacity, which we plan to exercise with an additional engineer during Q3 to lead an indexer improvement effort. We are also transferring some legacy RPP costs into Grants Lab in this bucket, in particular a monthly $20k contract with Raid Guild. Raid Guild works on projects that have high GMV potential but represent one-off builds that are not part of our core stack.\n \n![2.png](ipfs://bafkreihbappqmfskokyhyiqvihjfid2e5dytdos3nepxm65cazso4l7pz4)\n    \nSoftware:\n\nThis line item remains mostly flat for H2. We are taking on some costs from the EC, including website hosting, Figma, and KYC tooling which accounts for a slight increase.\n \n![3.png](ipfs://bafkreif7i3ejuh6om6ntdgn6g362qce4fcqo5akxptk45wti4xjljz5vyu)\n    \nTravel:\n\nThis line item should also remain flat for H2. We are decreasing our regular travel budget as we don’t use it as much outside of popular events (EthCC, EthDenver, and Dev Con.) The $15,000 spend in November represents DevCon costs, which are particularly high given that many leaders are traveling from North America and Europe.\n\n![11.png](ipfs://bafkreibev2citktyythclauoifk6bhaznu6oq333lziwfrl5iixiyrckka)\n    \nG&A and Miscellaneous:\n\nG&A was a catch-all bucket that we have deprecated now that we have better tracking of individual line items. We are opting for better tracking and tighter budgets over the traditionally requested safety net of funds.\n\nThe biggest line item in the miscellaneous bucket is audits – we plan to spend $75k on the Allo 2.1 audit in Q4, and likely $15-25k on an audit for new mechanisms before the end of the year. The cost of that new mechanism is distributed across various months.\n\n![5.png](ipfs://bafkreiaf7mbpkst5wqpymkfjpfbhit23zlbg3ais34yfvldy6aaus2owaa)\n    \nBudget Request\nThe total budget requested is $2,646,608 for July - December 2024.\n\nThis budget was requested in late July because Grants Lab was anticipated to have sufficient remaining funds from the Q4 2024 funding cycle (across PGF, GSD, GS, and Allo) to cover July expenses. Due to token volatility, Grants Lab requested a 150,000 USDC loan from CSDO to cover part of July expenses, which will be paid back once a budget successfully passes.\n\nH1 spend: $2,505,655, including Grants Lab, Allo, and Public Goods Funding\n\n![6.png](ipfs://bafkreigugjs2rvej3xubsfalhutqoqh733jvetpz2tx46na4ekhjbktld4)\n \nH2 projected spend: $2,646,608 (includes all of the above + some absorbed responsibilities from Ecosystem Collective)\n \n![8.png](ipfs://bafkreigmqhnt76gpjbjbb6wfjii2uvcvlkzhrgc2ftlfb34wqwzbmfwqqi)\n        \nCurrent Treasury:\nThe current treasury can be found at 0xd1f5d2A59Ef194aE00F27b2DA6599ce207ddE7cB and is summarized below.\n\n![9.png](ipfs://bafkreibfjdroehubo2vypyz5fqp4mxeczvzwoh5a3qoaukz4gk3owpakuu)\n    \nConclusion\nFeedback is welcomed on this budget request as well as the strategy post! \nH2 Proposal [Strategy] - Grants Labs 3 -> https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/h2-proposal-strategy-grants-labs/19198",

      "title": "[Proposal] Ratify Grants Lab Contributor Token Grant Program",
      "content": "TL;DR: Propose that current contributors to Grants Lab be eligible for a 4-year token grant, subject to a linear vesting schedule and a 1-year cliff. Contributors who have been at Gitcoin for over a year and have not previously received a token grant will be eligible for an accelerated 6-month cliff, instead of 1 year.\n\nOverview\nWith the introduction of Gitcoin 2.0, we have renewed focus as an organization and have set ambitious goals! We are driving towards $50M in GMV this year and a north star of $1B in GMV through Allo over the next several years.\n\nTo hit these goals, we need best-in-class contributor talent that is motivated and aligned with our mission and ambition.\n\nToken grants are a key tool we have to create those alignments. After all – the idea that we can program our values into money to ensure alignment is central to our vision for capital allocation 4.\n\nStructure\nI propose that every contributor to Grants Lab is eligible for a 4-year token grant. These grants will be subject to linear vesting schedules and a 1-year cliff. Contributors who have been at Gitcoin for over a year and have not previously received a token grant will be eligible for an accelerated 6-month cliff, instead of 1 year.\n\nThis proposal covers all current contributors to Grants Labs as well as an option pool for future contributors. In total, 3M GTC is requested. This represents 3% of the supply of GTC and is aligned with (or below) industry standards for team allocations. Though team allocations are typically only done at launch, Gitcoin has evolved substantially since the token launch in 2021. Most of the team that was present in 2021 are no longer active contributors, and the vast majority (80%) of current contributors do not have any token grants.",

Passport has generated revenue on OP and Linea (by enabling onchain attestations of one’s unique humanity, and OP RPGF3). Together with this funding, and a six month budget, we would like to formally request a vote to spin out of Gitcoin DAO. In return for bootstrapping the business unit, we will ensure Gitcoin has equity ownership in the new entity, a token allocation if/when we launch a token and a board seat in the new entity. The details on how a DAO may participate are a little murky (ie, have equity, and a board seat) and so we will be working with the Gitcoin Foundation to formalize the ownership and board seat appointment.\n\n### Funding Request for Season 23\nRequested Amount: Gitcoin Passport is requesting a net allocation of [TBD] GTC*, equivalent to approximately $1,604,857 out of the treasury to cover this final season.\n\n\n*The GTC amount requested and reserves will be updated based on market conditions when this proposal moves to Tally, using the lower of the current price or the 20-day moving average.",

We used a pluralistic variant of QF and we used Passport’s model-based detection system. We did not do any closed-source silencing of Sybils/Donors. Instead, we’re solely relying on our mechanism and Gitcoin Passport. We've shared links to access both the underlying code and data used to arrive at these calculations in our forum.\n\nWe ask our Community Stewards to ratify the GG20 payout amounts as being correct, fair, and abiding by community norms, including the implementation of Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching, and Passport scoring.\n\nMore details and the final results can be found in the governance forum post:\nhttps://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gg20-program-round-matching-results/18816\n\nOptions to vote on:\n\n1. Ratify the round results\nYou ratify the results as reported and request the keyholders of the community multisig to payout funds according to the GG20 final payout amounts.\n\n2. Request further deliberation\nYou wait to ratify the results and request keyholders of the community multi-sig wallet to delay payment until further notice.\n\n3. Abstain",

This engagement with Wonderland will ensure that Allo protocol is a world class protocol + eventually ecosystem.\n\nBy leveraging Wonderland’s expertise in protocol development we can ensure the right architecture, implementation, and velocity to pursue the highest potential outlined in the Whitepaper and Rainbow Paper.\n\nThe Gitcoin Protocol has been reinvented 4 times already (dgrants in 2021, 2022 era development, Allo v1 in 2023, Allo v2 in 2024). Having wonderland onboard will get us out of the expensive and high opportunity cost cycle of building it wrong => having to rebuild it while the market passes us by.\n\nBackground\nWonderland is a multi-protocol core development group They’re a collection of multi-disciplinary experts with a track record of backing their partners with solid, innovative DeFi solutions. Their “cool sh*t” approach is about rolling up sleeves, diving into data, and coming up with innovative solutions. They have worked with tier A teams like Optimism, Connext, Balancer, Reflexer, and more.\n\nThe Plan\nOver this engagement, we aim to tap into Wonderland’s expertise in protocol design and development to bolster our Grants Lab capabilities. We’re excited about co-creating the future with a partner who gets it—the long game, and the commitment to public goods.",

      "content": "# Intro\n\nThis snapshot vote serves to determine whether the DAO should fund the EthCC activation worth $41,000. The full proposal can be found here: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-budget-request-for-the-gitcoin-ethcc-activation/18451\n\n# TL;DR\n\nAs part of the Ecosystem Collective’s mission to steward Gitcoin’s brand, we are excited to announce our plans for an exciting and engaging EthCC activation. This proposal outlines the budget for the activation, including expenses for events, merchandise, and travel.\n\n### Events\nBelow are the scheduled events for the week:\n\n#### July 10th - Schelling Point Sessions: Grants Program Design\n\n250 pax event @ Jardin Brussels (half-day event)\nMore details coming soon\n\n#### TBC - Grants Program Manager Appreciation Event\n\nThe purpose of this event is a follow up to our Grants Program manager day we ran in Denver\n\nWe’re hoping to continue to create opportunities to bring together the program manager community to connect, socialize, learn, and grow together\nIt is highly unlikely that we will need the entire requested budget for this event, but we did want to create maximum flexibility so that we can create a great experience for this group of people that we are keen to connect with and learn from\n\nVenue TBD (evening event)\n\n#### TBC - Evening event with values-aligned partners\n\nDetails for this event are still unconfirmed\nWe are in conversation with several other potential partner orgs who would cohost the event and share costs\nIn the case we cannot find any values-and-objectives-aligned orgs to partner with us, we will not run this event and return earmarked funds to the treasury\nThe idea here would be to work with partners who have reach outside of our usual audiences to position Gitcoin at the center or grants-and-capital-allocation-related conversations, in line with the Ecosystem Collective’s OKR to “Position Gitcoin as the source of truth for web3 grants”\nLike with all our events, we aim to be prudent with the use of funds, trying to maximize the impact of an event and minimize costs, with all extra funds being returned to the treasury\n\n###  Total Budget\nThe total budget for the EthCC activation is ~$41,000 (€37,600.00). This number is subject to foreign exchange rates.\n\n###  Budget Breakdown\nGeneral\nTravel reimbursements for the team managing and contributing to these events: €10,000\n\nSchelling Point\n\nVenue Rental: €8,700\nTaxes / VAT: €2,000\nFood & bev: €1,900\nMerch total: €6250\nAV Equipment: €1,750\nPhotographer: €1,000\nGrants Program Manager event\n\nVenue rental + food & bev (based on costs of similar EthDenver event): €3,000\nEvening event\n\nVenue rental + food & bev (based on costs of similar EthDenver event): €3,000\nTotal expenditure = €37,600.00 / approximately $41,000\n\n### Sponsorships\nThere are several conversations happening around sponsorships. Should there be any additional funds raised from sponsorships, those funds will go directly to offsetting these costs.\n\n### Return of Funds\nIt is likely that most of these event costs will come under what has been budgeted. The last thing we want is to have a bill that is higher than what has been request, so many of these estimates have been rounded up, with the expectations of creating wiggle room in our budget for unforeseen expenses (which tends to be an inevitability when running events).\n\nThe team is also 100% committed to being prudent with any spend, only using the DAO’s treasury for mission critical items.\n\nAny leftover funds from the activation budget will be returned to the Gitcoin treasury.",

This will help council members review applications more easily.\n\nIn the proposed new structure, we will create a dedicated pool of funds (up to $125K quarterly) available to support “matching on matching” pools. Communities with any amount raised for matching and meeting the round criteria can apply for up to $25K in funding from Gitcoin to go toward their matching pool. The GG20 Community Council (a Gitcoin DAO-elected external council) will proceed to review applications and vote on which communities to fund in the upcoming round.",

In Seasons 20 and 21, we’ll concentrate on five key pillars:\n\n**Effectiveness**: Improve identity scoring models\n**Adoption**: Grow to 1.5M passports\n**GTC Utility**: Strengthen GTC-based identity and community ties\n**Data**: Enhance and aggregate Sybil detection and data sets\n**Partnerships**: Increase both API and onchain partnerships\nThe budget for S21 (Feb 1st - April 30th) was previously approved 3 and we’ll be moving funds with a Tally vote for $481,215 as the completion of that budget.\n\nGiven the announced changes to the organization, we do have two new roles we are hiring for (Product Marketing and Operations). Our budget request is slightly higher in S21, but we are under budget for S20. Details are outlined below in the Funding Request section.\n\nBudget Update: Season S21\nWe are maintaining a flat budget for S21, but incorporating previous costs and additional headcount that were previously allocated to the MMM workstream. The additional budget includes hiring a Sr. Product Marketing Manager, moving from part time to full time Operations, and adding consulting budget for GTM support.\n\n### Team Composition\n\nFull-Time Contributors: 10\n- Developers: 4\n- Product Manager: 1\n- Data Scientists: 2\n- Workstream Lead: 1\n- Operations: 1\n- Marketing: 1\n- Support: 2 (previously shared cost with Grants Labs, moving to fully dedicated to Passport)\n\nPart-Time or Shared Contributors: 5\n- Design: 1\n- DevRel: 2\n- DevOps: 2",

The key points were:\n\n\n\n* Lowering the quorum threshold from 2.5M GTC to 1M GTC for both on-chain and off-chain voting.\n* Reducing the initial proposal threshold from 1M GTC to 150K GTC.\n* Keeping the current time and duration for voting procedures intact.\n\n\n### Revised Proposal Details\n\nBased on technical advisability, the revised proposal is as follows:\n\n\n\n* Maintain Quorum Threshold: While the original plan was to reduce the quorum threshold to 1M GTC, we don’t want to deploy a new governor to make this change.\n* Reduce Proposal Threshold: Lower the requirement to initiate a proposal from 1M GTC to 150K GTC, making it easier for a wider range of stakeholders to actively participate in governance.\n* Maintain Current Voting Processes: The existing timeframes and procedures for both on-chain and off-chain voting will remain unchanged to ensure continuity and stability in our governance operations.",

      "title": "Adding oSnap for Gitcoin treasury distributions",
      "content": "### Summary\nWe propose adding oSnap, a governance tool developed by UMA, to the Gitcoin Snapshot space and Safe to allow for automatic onchain execution of token transfers and grant funding after successful Snapshot votes.\n\n### Abstract\nThe current Gitcoin governance flow uses offchain Snapshot voting to approve or deny proposals. However, proposals that are approved must then be repeated onchain with Tally to achieve onchain execution. This repeated vote is an administrative task that wastes the time and gas fees of DAO participants. There have been instances where the revote on Tally did not achieve Quorum and the revote had to be posted again, wasting even more time and gas.\n\nThe adoption of oSnap eliminates the need for the redundant Tally revote by automatically executing successful Snapshot votes onchain, thus consolidating the governance process to one gasless vote on Snapshot that results in onchain execution.\n\noSnap secures over $250M for treasuries including CoW Protocol, Across, Connext and Shapeshift. A dashboard of all oSnap users can be viewed here 6. oSnap was built by UMA, an experienced leader in optimistic verification. UMA’s optimistic oracle currently secures $450M of TVS across bridges, prediction markets and governance tools.\n\n### Motivation\nAdding oSnap aims to streamline the execution of governance decisions, bringing a new layer of efficiency and reliability to Gitcoin requiring minimal effort and no disruption to existing DAO governance systems. On top of these benefits, oSnap is highly aligned with Gitcoin as it is a public good that increases decentralization.\n\n### Specification\noSnap is a module that is added to a Safe with rules on how to evaluate a Snapshot proposal. oSnap Safe app lets you add oSnap to your Snapshot space and Safe in a few minutes with no developer time required. A video demonstration of the oSnap Safe App can be viewed here.\n\nOnce enabled, Snapshot proposals related to the distribution of funds from Gitcoin’s treasury can include token transfers with the proposal. There will be no changes related to proposals not related to treasury distributions, such as social votes relating to governance, removing a director, etc.\n\nThe updated Snapshot flow for proposals that include treasury distributions would be:\n\n* An oSnap enabled snapshot proposal is created. This process is the same as a normal Snapshot proposal with the addition of transaction data that will be verified and executed if the proposal passes. The Snapshot transaction builder is specifically designed to make it easy to create and verify transaction data for token transfers.\n\n* GTC holders vote on the proposal like any other Gitcoin Snapshot proposal\n\n* If GTC holders approve the proposal by vote, any address can post a bond (2 WETH) for a challenge period (1 to 3 days) and propose to execute the transactions onchain. UMA has implemented a bot that validates proposals (vote passed, meets min voting period/quorum) and posts the bond for DAOs along with covering gas costs for execution (there are no fees to use oSnap).\n\n* If no dispute arises about the proposal’s accuracy during the challenge period, the transactions can then be executed.\n\n* In case of a dispute, the proposal is not executed. UMA token holders vote to resolve the dispute, with the correct party rewarded from the opposing party’s bond. This bonding and dispute mechanism punishes incorrect proposers and disputers and incentivizes honest disputes. Any proposal that was incorrectly disputed can be re-proposed to the oracle for execution without requiring revoting. It is important to note, the dispute resolution decided by UMA token holder votes are not deciding if the transactions can be executed or not, only the bond allocation between the proposer and disputer.\n\nUMA created and maintains oSnap as a public good with no implementation or usage fees because we believe decentralized governance tools are critical to the entire Web3 ecosystem. Since UMA is already running robust monitoring across all of our optimistic oracle integrations and can recycle the bonds posted, the additional costs associated with these services are negligible and it is sustainable to continue providing this service for DAOs. If any changes were to be made in the future, we are committed to having existing DAOs not face any changes (aka be “grandfathered in”).\n\n### Benefits\nThe benefits of Gitcoin adopting oSnap are:\n\n* Adding oSnap removes the unnecessary, administrative step of an onchain Tally vote when releasing funds from Gitcoin’s treasury saving Gitcoin DAO voters time and gas fees.\n\n* Transaction payloads included in proposals that are approved by voters are trustlessly and permissionlessly executed which increases transparency and decentralization.\n\n* Automatic transaction execution by UMA bots is faster than waiting for multi-sig signers along with the bot paying the gas costs for execution.\n\n* The UMA team is continuously making frontend improvements as per user feedback and improving open source monitoring infrastructure for oSnap.\n\nUMA has also focused significant resources on monitoring efforts:\n\n* The same bot that proposes and executes transactions also automatically disputes inaccurate proposals if the following criteria are not met:\n\n   * The proposed onchain transactions match the transactions that were approved in the Snapshot proposal\n   * The Snapshot proposal passed with the minimum parameters specified (majority in favor, meets minimum voting period and quorum)\n   * The proposal follows the strategy specified in the Snapshot space.\n* Proposals are included in the UMA Oracle UI (https://oracle.uma.xyz/) which is the same interface used by disputers verifying and disputing for other third-party integrations (Polymarket, Sherlock, Cozy, and other oSnap integrations).\n\n* UMA sponsors a verification program, that pays UMA community members to verify all optimistic oracle assertions So when any transactions are proposed through oSnap, a Discord ticket is automatically created and an experienced verifier from the UMA community completes a multi-step verification process that focuses on areas such as the transaction payload matching the intent of the proposal, verifies transactions do not include interactions with malicious contracts, etc.\n\n### Drawbacks\nWhile oSnap has been audited by Open Zeppelin, as with any system, there may be unforeseen vulnerabilities.",

      "title": "[GCP 017] Gitcoin Citizens Retroactive Funding Round",
      "content": "## Summary\nThis proposal is requesting $153k in GTC to continue a series of retroactive quadratic funding rounds to reward efforts supporting the Gitcoin Community, specifically by Gitcoin Citizens.\n\nCitizens are value-aligned community members who are eager to contribute their time and skills in service of Gitcoin’s mission. Running these rounds lowers the barrier of entry for contributing to the DAO, determines what the community values most, and helps test (dogfood) all of our products, driving innovation. This budget will fund two more Citizens Rounds including operations, and a supplement for community engagement.\n\n## Abstract\nOver the past two seasons we have run a 95K GTC-funded experiment, incentivizing community support for Gitcoin and its ecosystem. Round #1 stands as Gitcoin’s most successful crowdfunding versus matching round to date 1. With round #2 we doubled down on PGN as our network of choice, and invited our community to not only apply for retroactive funding but also submit planned work, as part of our initial GCP.\n\nWe’ve been blown away by the community’s enthusiasm and deeply impressed by the value they’ve created. Value by our community, for our community, without any top-down guidance. Further details can be found in this case study by Grants Stack, our reporting on round 1 and in our overall learnings report covering these initial two rounds. The Citizens Rounds have also served as a development testbed for Gitcoin between Program Rounds, and for us this is just the beginning. We’re eager to continue supporting our Citizens, helping them to better support the ecosystem while rallying the ecosystem itself to support our Citizens even more through these rounds.\n\nFor this reason we are requesting funding for two more rounds, aiming to further grow awareness and momentum for this initiative. Our goal is to establish the Citizens Rounds as a cornerstone of the DAO’s way of working and a key driver of Gitcoin’s essential intents.\n\n## Motivation\nWe view the Citizens Rounds as a model for our DAO, fostering a bottom-up, skills-driven owner’s mentality, bringing us back to the essence of what being a DAO is about. We’ll continue to check in with our community on missing pieces to achieve our goals, with a high focus on impact through retroactive funding.\n\nThe mission of the Citizens Rounds is deeply aligned with Gitcoin’s updated essential intents:\n\n*1. Network Effects:* Each additional Gitcoin Citizen joining the network increases the value for all the other Citizens who now each have an additional potential collaborator and funder. This then increases the value of the round for the whole Gitcoin ecosystem. We’ve also seen other ecosystems starting their own retroPGF rounds for community contributions (Arbitrum Citizens, Ethereum contributors, Starknet, and of course Optimism), creating a positive flywheel that attracts more and more builders.\n*2. Community First:* With our rounds we are telling our ambassadors that we see them, we appreciate them, and we want to reward them. Through funding and coaching we are empowering community members to actively contribute to Gitcoin’s evolution.\n*3. Financial Longevity:* Our rounds yield significant returns on investments, with a low budget of $50-75K/quarter for all Citizens versus a total budget of +$3MM for full-time DAO contributors over the same period (details in our learnings report).\n\n## Specifications\n### Budget\nThis proposal is requesting a budget of 153K in GTC in funding for two rounds, including operations. The breakdown is as follows:\n\n* 50K Round #3: 40K matching pool + 10K GTC signal boosting\n* 70K Round #4: 60K matching pool + 10K GTC signal boosting\n* 32K Staffing: 16K round operations + 16K community engagement\n* 1K Reserves: expenses, eg. subscriptions, gas, transactions slippage\n\nFurther details on signal boosting and community engagement are provided below. Note that without community engagement (which goes beyond operations), the overhead cost is 12%. Our aim is to reduce this further in the future by offsetting round operator costs through round participation.\n\n### Changes Since Previous GCP\nWe have learned so much during our first two rounds, you can find a full overview of this in our learnings report 5.\n\nSome of the key changes:\n\n* Our next rounds will be fully retroactive, allowing us to focus on results, impact and a streamlined review process.\n* We’re introducing a signal boosting mechanism, allocating an additional 10K/round for projects deemed impactful by our inner community. Key stakeholders will be airdropped the funding to divide this amount among projects of their choice, helping Citizens focus and inspiring stakeholders to communicate on future tasks more regularly.\n* We’ll continue to update and revise our eligibility criteria, focusing on defining Citizens’ work and individual efforts.\n* We want to gradually increase the awareness for this initiative. The ultimate goal is to make the Citizens Rounds into a perpetual, higher cadence, recurring initiative. We’re requesting a higher budget for the main round operator, to reflect the reality of round 1 & 2, and a recommended supplement for increased community engagement (see below).\n* The proposed extra community engagement layer aims to heighten our focus on impact.\n\n### Impact & Community Engagement\nNext to the budget for round operations (16K), which is similar to the one of the past rounds, we propose funding for related community engagement work, managed by the driving round operator. The (maximum) estimated cost is 100hrs/quarter or 8K for two rounds, totaling 16K.*\n\n*Note: This is a maximum amount, which will be documented in detail similarly to the timesheets for round 1-2. As a Citizen the round operator will also raise funds for this part: whatever is community funded is not paid from the treasury.\n\n*Context:*\n\nKris, as driving round operator, has been a dedicated ‘meta Citizen,’ bridging gaps between Citizens, product teams, and support. In the last two seasons, he has contributed around 180-250 hours to support Gitcoin without remuneration. He has been logging tickets, reviewing strategic documents and reading up and engaging on the forum and in discord, wherever and whenever relevant. This work, while not always directly measurable, enhances the efficiency and impact of Citizens.\n\nWe believe it is crucial for the success of the Citizens rounds to continue going this extra mile but would request for this crucial work to be funded as of now.\n\n*Goals:*\n\n*1. Increase impact* by directly supporting an ‘insider’ to educate and bridge between key stakeholders and Citizens.\n*2. Showcase transition:* Demonstrate how a high-impact Citizen can shift from a retainer fee to full community funding.\n\n*Scope of Work*\n\n* Citizens Education & Branding\n* Setting Community & Communication Guidelines\n* Office Hours & Advisory Calls\n* Discord & Telegram Management\n* Social Media Presence & Management\n* Crowdsourcing Open Tasks\n* Stakeholder Engagement\n\n## Benefits\nThe Citizens Rounds can serve as a model for the DAO, emphasizing a bottom-up, owner’s mentality and encouraging the community to identify missing elements to achieve our goals, prioritizing impact through retroactive funding.\nThis initiative is deeply aligned with Gitcoin’s updated essential intents, focusing on maximizing network effects, fostering permissionless community contributions, with a minimal budget, and a maximum return on investment.\nThis round allows us to continue dogfooding our tooling, gives devs and product a place to test new features outside of program rounds, and provides a case study for others.\n\n## Drawbacks:\n* The community could reward non-strategic or lower value work.\n* The process could compensate at greater than market rates for popular deliverables.\n\n## Success measures:\n* Two more funding rounds have been executed & lessons learned have been captured\n* Key stakeholders continue to see the Citizens as creating value in line with our essential intents\n* A project close out has been written with recommendations on if/how to proceed\n\n## Vote\nYes: Fund the Citizens Rounds for 153K GTC\nNo: Do not fund the Citizen Rounds\nAbstain: I am missing context or am impacted by this proposal",

      "title": "Vote to Lower GTC Voting threshold",
      "content": "We currently see ~10 large GTC token holders 8 with the majority of on chain voting power, and ultimately decide most on/off chain decisions. I want to change this, and one of the first steps will be to lower the thresholds so that smaller token holder’s voices will have a larger presence in the process.\n\nWe have needed to keep a number of folks above 1MM to ensure proposals can be created, but by lowering the thresholds, we can lower the amount of GTC of individuals and enable the community to more broadly decide and participate in impactful ways.\n\nIt is hopefully no secret that token delegation from larger GTC token holders is why the top 10 have the token delegation allocations they do. This has largely been to empower those with the most context to help lead and guide governance. What this actually created though is a group that feels they cannot dissent, and a community that has a diminished voice in the process.\n\nOur current v3 gov process outlines the following:\n\n> There are two kinds of votes, off-chain and on-chain:\n>\n> * Off-chain voting takes place on Snapshot and is required before any vote can be moved to an on-chain vote (if necessary). The vote period is 5 days. Use this template for reference\n> * On-chain voting is required in addition to Snapshot voting for proposals that would move GTC from the DAO treasury or make other key changes to the structure of the DAO. Gitcoin will be using Tally to upload on-chain proposals. The vote period is 5 days.\n\nThere is also a call out on post about quorum requirements – ie, a need for 2.5M GTC to participate in all votes for the vote to be considered valid.\n\n### Risks\nLowering the voting threshold opens us up to more governance attacks if large amount of tokens are acquired. This can be mitigated through delegation to a couple of key long term steward token holders who perhaps don’t activate those wallets unless an attack is visible. This is common and you can see this with Uni when key votes haven been decided by largely silent voters to help protect the network.\n\n### Proposed Changes to Governance\n1. New quorum threshold of 1MM GTC instead of 2.5MM GTC for both on chain and off chain voting\n2. Lower initial proposal threshold down to 150k GTC from 1MM GTC\n3. Maintain time and duration process as outlined above**\n\n## Establishment of Guardian Stewards\n\nThe section below outlines the details of a new role that will be introduced in order to mitigate potential risks of this proposal.\n\n**1. Purpose and Function of Guardian Stewards**\n\n**Role**: Guardian Stewards will act as a defensive mechanism against governance attacks in the DAO. They will remain largely passive but will be authorized to activate their voting power in case of a detected attack or threat to the integrity of the DAO’s governance.\n**Activation Criteria**: Clear guidelines will be established to define what constitutes a governance attack in a separate post/thread, ensuring that the Guardian Stewards’ power is exercised judiciously and transparently.\n\n**2. Election Process for Guardian Stewards**\n\n**Nomination**: For the first term, Guardian Stewards will be assigned by the Gitcoin Foundation. In the future, Stewards and Core Contributors will be able to nominate candidates for the role of Guardian Steward. Nominees should have a demonstrated history of long-term involvement and a deep understanding of the DAO’s mission and governance.\n**Voting**: Once we have our first elections, Guardian Stewards elections will be conducted via a special DAO Core Contributor vote, separate from regular governance votes, to ensure fairness and transparency and that elected members are being selected by high context individuals. As we get closer to election time, there is possibility of opening up this election beyond Core Contributors.\n\n**3. Source of Tokens for Guardian Stewards**\n\n**Allocation**: A specified amount of GTC tokens will be allocated to the Guardian Stewards. This allocation could come from a dedicated fund or reserve within the DAO’s treasury, specifically earmarked for governance defense.\n\n**Token Stewardship**: The tokens will remain under the control of the Guardian Stewards but are to be used solely for the purpose of defending the DAO’s governance process.\n\n**4. Roles and Responsibilities**\n\n**Monitoring**: Guardian Stewards will be responsible for monitoring voting activities and identifying potential threats.\n**Decision to Act**: The decision to activate their voting power must be unanimous among all Guardian Stewards to prevent misuse.\nTransparency and Reporting: Guardian Stewards will be required to provide transparent reporting on any actions taken, including the rationale behind activating their voting power.\n\n**5. Term and Accountability**\n\n**Term Length**: Guardian Stewards will serve for a fixed term of six months, after which new elections will be held. Guardian Stewards can run for reelection as many times as they would like.\n**Accountability**: They will be accountable to the broader DAO community, with mechanisms in place for the community to recall a Guardian Steward if necessary.\n\n**6. Title and Recognition**\n\n**Title**: Members of this group will be formally recognized as “Guardian Stewards” of the DAO.\n**Recognition**: This role will be documented and maintained in the Governance Manual and will be entrusted to Stewards in high esteem in the Gitcoin Community.\n\n**7. Budget**\n\n**Funding**: This role will not be funded due to the little amount of action that will be required.\n\n## Roles & Responsibilities if the Vote is Passed\n\n* The Governance Coordinator will work with CSDO to ensure that the new thresholds are applied and that the Wallet Guardians are selected and allocated tokens\n* The Governance Coordinator will ensure that the Governance Manual is updated with the necessary documentation to reflect this new aspect of governance\n* The Governance Coordinator will keep the community updated on progress in the Governance Forum",

      "title": "[GCP 016] Gitcoin Team Coordination in Q1 2024",
      "content": "TLDR\nThis proposal is asking for the GTC equivalent of $175,000USD to bring together Gitcoin’s global and remote core contributors in Q1 2024. The treasury funds would be used to sponsor 4 nights of accommodation, hotel, transportation to/from the airport, and several team activities for DAO core contributors, with an additional 1-2 (TBC) night/day of activities for the CSDO team.\n\nAbstract\nThe event will include various activities such as:\n- Team-building, Ideation, and Planning activities organized by workstreams and the organization\n- Team dinner (excluding alcohol)\n- Small welcome party (appetizers, etc.)\n\nNB: Pre and post-event surveys will measure impact and gather feedback.\n\nMotivation\nThe core motivation behind this proposal is the belief that annual in-person gatherings are crucial for enhancing team interactions, promoting team cohesion, and encouraging cross-workstream communication. Building a sense of community among our core contributors will help ensure we are thoughtfully conducting medium- and long-term planning for the organization.\n\nSuch interactions deepen our sense of humanity and offer an environment where the challenges and opportunities of decentralizing human organizations can be explored.\n\nDetails (still mostly TBC)\nA survey was conducted internally to better gauge sentiment around timing/location of where to hold this event for our (very) international team.\n\nApprox. number of attendees: 50\n\nTentative date: March/April\n\nPossible locations (based on sentiment + affordability):\n\nLisbon, Portugal\nDenver, CO\nMexico City, MX\n\nSample Cost Breakdown\nThe amounts below are estimates, since costs will vary depending on the selected location and finalized plans. Regardless, the intent is to minimize costs while creating a great atmosphere for collaborative work.\n\nFlights: ±$55,000\nHotel Accommodations: ±$40,000\nTransportation: ±$6,000\nContributor Per Diem: ±$20,000\nOffice/Gathering Space(s): ±$2,000\nTeam Building: ±$5,000\nWelcome Party Gathering: ±$2,000\nMarketing Materials: ±$25,000\nTeam Dinner: ±$5000\nTotal: ± $135,000\n\nThe request is for the GTC equivalent of $175,000USD to cover all costs and expenses.\n\nNB: A 25% buffer has been applied to the grand total to account for the rapidity of proposal funding, fluctuations in flight prices, and other unforeseen costs. Any funds not used will be paid back to the treasury.\n\nTentative Schedule\nA rough draft of a potential schedule for the event is listed on the gov forum post.\n\nOther Considerations\n- Planning of the event will be led by @deltajuliet and @CoachJonathan on logistics and CSDO for programming\n- This offsite is for Core Contributors\n- Members of CSDO can nominate additional individuals to join that they think will contribute to the programming and medium-to-long-term planning of the DAO\n- CSDO Nominees must be majority approved by the rest of the CSDO members\n\nTimeline and Expectations\nUpon approval and funding of this proposal, detailed planning for each activity and agenda will kick off. The community can expect a follow-up on costs/spend after funding approval, ad hoc updates on planning and a post-event wrap up that includes spending updates.\n\nBenefits\n- Enhanced Team Cohesion: Strengthening interpersonal relationships for easier and more effective collaboration.\n- Cross-Workstream Communication: Facilitating dialogues across different workstreams.\n- Innovation and Ideation: Conducive environment for brainstorming and ideation.\n- Contributor Wellbeing: Activities contributing to mental and physical wellness.\n- Community Building: A shared experience to build a stronger sense of community among Gitcoin contributors.\n- Potential Positive Effects on the Gitcoin Ecosystem:\n- Increased Productivity: Improved team cohesion and well-being lead to increased productivity.\n- Enhanced Quality of Work: Better understanding and communication among team members.\n- Stronger Alignment with Organizational Goals: Cross-functional interactions for better alignment with Gitcoin’s overall objectives.\n- Improved feedback loops & opportunity tracking: Pre and post-surveys for valuable insights into the event’s impact.\n\nDrawbacks\n- Resource Allocation: The proposal comes at a time when financial prudence is crucial. The funding request may raise questions about priorities.\n- Distraction: The event may divert attention from ongoing projects or workstreams, affecting their timelines or quality.\n- Measurement of Outcomes: The impact of the gathering may be hard to quantify immediately, given its focus on long-term team cohesion and productivity.\n- Logistical Challenges: Coordinating a global gathering poses logistical difficulties that could potentially affect the event’s success.\n\nWallet address: CSDO multisig - 0x931896A8A9313F622a2AFCA76d1471B97955e551\n\nVote:\nYes grant the GTC equivalent of $175,000USD for this initiative\nNo do not grant the GTC equivalent of $175,000USD for this initiative\nAbstain",

We will post a similar proposal for GSD here on the forum for the community to review very soon.\n\nGPT will be responsible for the success of both Program and Community Rounds during the Gitcoin Grants cycles.

      "content": "This is the funding proposal for the MMM Workstream, requesting funding for Season 20 (1 Nov 2023 through 31 Jan 2024), authored by Viriya.\n---------------\n\nMMM TL;DR\nMMM’s primary purpose is to serve the marketing needs of the DAO by providing marketing strategy, coordination, content, and design support. This past season we officially expanded our scope to include stakeholder comms as part of our work (i.e., steward comms/ PR).\n\nIn our S18/S19 budgets, we set our north star as “Reposition Gitcoin as a tech-first organization”. We intend to continue orient toward this north star by managing our 4 out of 5 brands and working to serve product/program goals.\n\nYou’ll note that this budget proposal outlines plans for 3 months–a departure from the 6 month requests made by the product & program teams. This is to ensure that we are building and resourcing iterative plans that are sensing and responding to the emerging needs of our products. We found that 3 months is a time period that feels appropriate for the reassessment of marketing resourcing as we continue to learn, iterate and find PMF. We are hoping that we can return to a 6 month budgeting cadence in 2024 as resourcing needs stabilize.\n\nAmount\nMMM is requesting $512,483 for S20, including reserves and rolled over amounts. We will be rolling over only a very small amount due to the incident of misdirected funds and our subsequent request for a significantly smaller portion of our budget (the full request would have left us with ± $250,000 in additional reserves). We are also expecting to pay severance to several contributors as part of our recent RIF.\n\nThe amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.\n\nMMM Multisig address: 0xC23DA3Ca9300571B9CF43298228353cbb3E1b4c0\nCan be verified here: https://manual.gitcoin.co/introduction-and-overview/dao-finances",

Our purpose is to help grants managers easily launch, manage, and grow their grants programs. The product was internally trialed in an Alpha/Beta process in H1 23 to run Gitcoin Grants rounds. Our focus has now shifted to external adoption and growth.\n\nWe’re still early in our growth curve but gaining momentum and adoption. Our focus in S20 and S21 will be accelerating that adoption by leveraging our Quadratic Funding and Direct Grants features, and introducing paid pricing to reinvest in our product development efforts. Our product will be successful when the grants managers who use it achieve community involvement and builder engagement that makes their programs successful.\n\nAmount\nGrants Stack is requesting a total of $1,037,180 for S20-21. The first Tally proposal (posted if this vote is successful) will be for $345,868 for S20. We have budgeted a total of $496,090 for S20, and the difference comes from excess budget in S19 + carryover reserves.\n\nThe amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.\n\nWe will be requesting our funds through one Snapshot vote, but the release of the actual funds will be split over two Tally votes (one at the start of each season) for reasons of accountability and to mitigate potential price fluctuations.",

We will start one with the following rules:\n\n- All non-offensive applications are accepted\n- Grants must get at least 100 unique contributions above a 20 passport score to receive any matching payout\n- Grants must share a detailed document on how they attacked the system via email before payouts and be available to answer questions (and preferably, but not required: hop on an anonymous voice call)\n- 80% matching cap: if a single attacker drastically outcompetes the others they can claim up to $4k\n- All donors will be labeled as Sybils in the Passport data sets and may not be able to receive scores or reuse credentials in the future\n\nThis will also require support from the MMM team to communicate about the round to draw in participants. This would involve:\n\n- One design asset\n- One or two emails\n- Several tweets\n\n## Vote: \n**Yes:** Pilot the Sybil Attacker QF Round and allocate $5k from the matching pool\n\n**No:** Do not fund this work and do not move forward\n\n**Abstain:** I am missing context or this proposal needs more refinement",

      "content": "This is the integrated funding proposal for the Gitcoin Allo Workstream, requesting funding for Season 20 and S21 (1 Nov 2023 through 30 April 2024), authored by Zakk Fleischmann and Nate Gosselin. \n\nTL;DR\nAllo Protocol is a resource allocation protocol that enables communities to more effectively invest in their needs. The initial iteration, v1, went to mainnets in December 2022 and currently powers Grants Stack. We began working on Allo v2 in July and are currently in the final stages of auditing its code, with v2 slated to deploy to mainnets by the end of October.\n\nWe believe that a resource allocation protocol is a core piece of infrastructure with high long-term potential, and that the “community investment” use case can support a full ecosystem of user-facing applications. This belief drove our investment in v2, as the new design makes it easier to create new applications and provides a more powerful profile registry. However, we are aware that we are facing headwinds due to the bear environment and that we may be a little too early for the market. Our focus in S20 and S21 will be testing the market’s current ability to support this ecosystem so that we can make a more informed decision about our mid-term strategy.\n\nAmount\nAllo is requesting 809,250 GTC* = $758,398 for S20-21, assuming .93 USD/GTC, excluding reserves and rolled over amounts.\n\n*The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.\n\nWe will be requesting our funds through one Snapshot vote, but the release of the actual funds will be split over two Tally votes (one at the start of each season) for reasons of accountability and to mitigate potential price fluctuations.\n\nThe full proposal can be found here: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-allo-s20-21-budget-request/16766",

It included 4 Core Rounds:\n- Open Source Software -  300,000 DAI matching pool\n- Ethereum Infrastructure - 106.9 ETH (~$200,000) matching pool on the new PGN chain\n- Web3 Community & Education\t- 250,000 DAI pool\n- Climate Solutions - 350,000 DAI pool*\n*Climate round grantees were given the option to opt-in to an extra $100k of matching funds from Shell. Over 64% of projects chose to opt-in to this funding.\n\nPost-round analysis had a $300k financial impact. This means $150k was reduced from projects that saw Sybil or collusive activity and given to other projects. GG18 Core rounds were the first to ever implement Cluster-Match QF, a novel approach to reduce the impact of collusion and Sybil attacks.\n\nWe ask our Community Stewards to ratify the GG18 payout amounts as being correct, fair, and abiding by community norms, including the implementation of Passport scoring as well as Sybil/Fraud judgments, squelching, and quadratic funding parameters made by the Public Goods Funding workstream.\n\nMore details and the final results can be found in the governance forum post:\nhttps://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-ratify-the-results-of-gg18-and-formally-request-the-community-multisig-holders-to-payout-matching-allocations/16553\n\nOptions to vote on:\n\n1. Ratify the round results\nYou ratify the results as reported by the Public Goods Funding workstream and request the keyholders of the community multisig to payout funds according to the GG18 final payout amounts.\n\n2. Request further deliberation\nYou wait to ratify the results and request keyholders of the community multi-sig wallet to delay payment until further notice.\n\n3. Abstain",

      "content": "## Summary\nGitcoin has been working with ScopeLift for a number of months to develop, test and now implement new onchain governance contracts for the Gitcoin DAO. These new contracts are built on tested Open Zeppelin contracts that bring Governor Bravo functionality to our DAO’s governance. These new contracts also have the Flexible Voting extension which has been audited twice. \n\nFlexible Voting provides a permissionless interface for integration and experimentation via voting contracts, enabling a host of new use cases to eventually be built (layer 2 voting, shielded voting, new delegation schemes, etc…). It is our goal to have the DAO review and approve the upgrade to these new contracts, and then for us to migrate our governor contracts.\n\n## Details\nThis vote is to approve the governor upgrade without moving funds out of the treasury first. We are proposing not moving funds as the DAO just recently moved 3M USDC to a multisig controlled by CSDO and we feel like that should offer sufficient safety net.\n\nThere has been decent discourse on the governance forums and I encourage everyone to check out the dialog happening there if you want more details on the benefits, risks and why we are pursuing this.\n\n## Vote\nThere will be three options to select from:\n1 - Vote to upgrade the governor contracts without making any changes to the details in which currently follow (ie, threshold, quorum, duration, etc. will all remain the same and can be adjusted at a later date).\n2 - Do not upgrade the governor contract at this time.\n3 - Abstain",

(Quadratic Experimentation and Development) program, which aims to answer those questions through the development and implementation of collusion-resistant Quadratic Funding mechanisms for Gitcoin Grants. The project lead for Q.E.D. has developed state-of-the-art collusion-resistant QF mechanisms 2 in collaboration with leaders in the field 1, and brings to the table an ability to rigorously understand the unique needs of Allo Protocol. Q.E.D.'s aim is to create a more inclusive and democratic funding model that addresses collusion and improves the efficiency and fairness of the funding process, as well as to educate our prospective and current partners about the trade-offs that can be made in their own Allo use-cases.\n\nProposal\nWe propose to deliver the following:\n\n- A tailored mathematical framework for understanding QF within Gitcoin’s context.\n- Empirical analysis of collusion-resistant mechanisms using Gitcoin Grants data.\n- Product roadmap with recommendations for data collection practices and Gitcoin Allo/ Passport feature analysis.\n- Series of articles for marketing, educational, and onboarding purposes.\n- Bi-weekly updates to the Gitcoin community.",

      "title": "[GCP-013] Seed Universal Impact Pools",
      "content": "Author(s): Robbie (Endaoment), Zakk (Gitcoin) \n\nSummary\nThis proposal seeks Gitcoin community approval for a grant to fund Endaoment’s Universal Impact Pools: a novel mechanism for matching donations to nonprofit organizations and a collaboration between Endaoment.org 4 and Gitcoin’s Allo Protocol.\n\nThe proposal is requesting $60,000 in Eth from Gitcoin’s matching pool to seed the Universal Impact Pool.\n\nAbstract\n\nEndaoment is in the process of building an integration with Gitcoin’s Allo Protocol that will allow donations on the existing platform to count as votes in a Quadratic Funding (QF) round. The matching pool for these rounds will be sourced from DAOs, donor-advised funds, and charitable giving organizations. The funds will be distributed to non-profit organizations, further amplifying people’s giving on Endaoment.\n\nThis new feature, set to be released on June 29, 2023, will be a new way for communities to match funding to nonprofit organizations and bring the power of QF to a new audience. This proposal further strengthens the relationship between Endaoment and Gitcoin and is strategically aligned with Gitcoin’s goals for Allo Protocol.\n\nBackground\n\nEndaoment and Gitcoin are leading the effort to innovate on new forms of community-powered, onchain impact. While focused on different types of donation-based funding, both have had an enormous impact on the ecosystem. Together, their technologies present a compelling advancement in philanthropic distribution models and an opportunity to significantly reduce governance decision making for DAOs or individuals who wish to contribute to a wide range of impact-focused causes.\n\nBoth protocols have demonstrated the capacity to raise money for public goods organizations—over $100m USD combined and growing. However, there is still a lot of friction for protocols, DAO Treasuries, and Institutional funds to participate in community-matched funding. Previously, both Endaoment and Gitcoin have tried to raise funds for causes through individual governance proposals, individual partnership, and matching efforts. Despite the available capital, success has been much greater with individual donors than with treasury distributions.\n\nThis collaboration is our joint attempt to resolve that coordination problem by using the collective activity across the Endaoment protocol as the voting strategy for distributions from a matching fund. Through one-time (or perpetual) donations to this fund, donors and DAOs alike can focus on their own missions while distributing their money in an optimized manner to a wide range of non-profits. The ability to make a single decision while maximizing global impact facilitates a much simpler process for DAO impact initiatives.\n\nIn order to create this type of fund, the Allo team at Gitcoin reached out to Endaoment ahead of the launch of their flexible on-chain community fund-matching protocol and tooling infrastructure. The combination of the two protocols’ main primitives (quadratic funding calculations via the Grants Stack and onchain philanthropic activity from the Endaoment Subgraph) presents an example of how open-source interoperable tooling for DAOs maximizes its efficacy when used in concert.\n\nMotivation\n\nGitcoin’s support for Impact Pools is motivated by several key factors:\n\n1. Strategically aligns with Allo Protocol’s launch\n\nEndaoment’s integration proves one of the powerful ways in which existing protocols and communities can use Gitcoin’s Allo Protocol: wrapped voting. Existing protocols often attempt to incentivize behaviors like minting, staking, providing liquidity, and so on. So far, this has been done through yield or other reward mechanisms. Allo Protocol unlocks the ability for protocols to turn these same behaviors into voting in a QF round (or any other allocation strategy) by wrapping the protocol method (i.e. mint() or stake()) in a voting strategy’s vote() method.\n\n2. Creates a plurality of implementations for Quadratic Funding\n\nEndaoment is a strategically aligned partner to Gitcoin and is equally dedicated to creating a positive impact with web3 technologies. By integrating with Gitcoin’s Allo Protocol, Endaoment is bringing the power of QF to a new segment of web3. This integration means that internationally known nonprofit organizations such as Doctors Without Borders, the Jane Goodall Foundation, WhyHunger, Rainforest Conservancy, the Nature Conservancy, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and many more will be exposed to QF.\n\n3. Creates a new impact maximization tool for DAOs (including Grants DAOs)\n\nThis combined effort gives DAOs an entirely new tool for their grant-making and giving. Web3 organizations like ArtBlocks, Uniswap Grants, Circle, Coinbase Impact, Nouns, Ukraine DAO, Unicorn DAO, Constitution DAO, and many more already give to nonprofit organizations using Endaoment. Universal Impact Pools will give DAOs a new tool that simplifies their giving while maximizing their impact.\n\nSpecification\n\nEndaoment recently kicked off development on an exciting new feature that deeply integrates Quadratic Funding. Impact Pools will be a way to further advance the donations people make on Endaoment by making them part of a QF round. Once launched, Endaoment expects to expand the feature further by running quarterly QF rounds and by eventually launching category-specific matching pools.\n\n“Impact pools are a new kind of matching fund geared towards a new kind of nonprofit fundraising that uses community protocol activity to allocate equitably to causes”\n\nThe first version of this integration uses parts of Gitcoin’s Grants Stack to calculate the quadratic distribution of the matching pool based on donations in Endaoment’s existing protocol. It works in much the same way that Grants Stack does: events emitted by a smart contract in Endaoment’s protocol are indexed offchain; at the end of the round, Endaoment will calculate the distribution of the matching pool based on these events. The distribution will then be shared to the nonprofit organizations on Endaoment. All of this functionality is based off of and meant to closely model how Gitcoin currently runs grant rounds on the Grants Stack.\n\n\n2166×1560 259 KB\n\nWe will integrate more deeply with Allo Protocol as we grow adoption for this feature on Endaoment and the Allo team finalizes version 2 of the protocol. At that time, we will write custom voting and payout strategies that bring as much of the calculation and allocation onchain as possible. This will automate QF rounds, which we expect to expand to each category in Endaoment.\nAt a high-level, this means we will write a custom voting strategy that can be used with Allo Protocol and wrap the existing donation method in Endaoment’s smart contracts. Behind the user interface, when someone donates to a nonprofit on Endaoment, they’ll be interacting with this voting strategy, which in turn interacts with Endaoment’s smart contracts to complete the donation.\n\nMilestones & Timeline:\n\n05/22 - Development kicks off\n06/23 - QA begins for Q2 Distribution Round\n06/29 - Public launch\n07/01 - Q2 Distribution Round ends using votes from 04/01/23 - 06/30/23\n07/01 - Start Q3 Distribution Round\n07/06 - Keynote presentation about Impact Pools at EthBarcelona\n07/08 - Payout deadline for Q2 Distribution Round\nBudget\n\n$60,000 in Eth of matching pool funds for the first year of grantmaking from the Endaoment Universal Impact Pool\n100% of these funds will go to seeding the matching pool on Endaoment. All development and operational costs are to be burdened by Endaoment. Endaoment and MMM will co-market the launch as a successful integration with Allo Protocol (already budgeted). Allo’s Developer Relations team will continue to provide technical support for the integration (already budgeted).\n\nBenefits\n\nThe benefits of this Community Proposal are:\n\nEndaoment has partnered with Allo Protocol to build out the first example of an important use case of the protocol: wrapped voting. This will be an open source example for how other protocols can do the same.\nPlurality of QF venues: this brings QF to a new audience and community in an organization that is strategically aligned with Gitcoin.\nDrawbacks\n\nThe largest potential drawback for this proposal is that it could set the precedent that matching pool funds will be available for those who integrate with Allo Protocol. While we believe this is a strong, strategically aligned proposal, we recognize that matching pool funds should not always be available for everyone who integrates with Allo Protocol.\n\nVote\nYes: Vote yes to grant $60,000 in Eth to seed the Impact Pool matching pool for QF rounds run on Allo Protocol through Endaoment\nNo: Do not fund this grand and do not move forward\nAbstain: I am missing context or this proposal needs more refinement.\n\nFor more information - see the link below to the forum discussion.",

The plan is to target 40% of workstream budgets are issued in USDC instead of GTC.\n\n### Specification\nMove 3M USDC to the CSDO multisig: eth:0x931896A8A9313F622a2AFCA76d1471B97955e551\n\nThis Gnosis safe is a 4/6 with other workstream leads in the DAO.\n\n### Vote\nThe vote will be a yes / no vote. Move the 3M in USDC to the CSDO mutlisig, or do not move the GTC.

      "content": "THE PROBLEM:\nOver the past month, web3 (Gitcoin included) has experienced a series of “fake” or scam Snapshot proposals that have been posted to various DAO snapshot sites. \n\nTo quickly lock down the proposal capability, the Gitcoin Snapshot account was locked using Gitcoin Passport, limiting posters to those who had donated to past grants rounds. This approach had issues given that database updates were no all ways 100%, thus the account was updated to allow posting only from those with a balance of at least 100GTC, or those who had greater than 1000 Twitter followers.\n\nTENSION:\nThe social contract governing the proposal/vote process at Gitcoin was defined in Gitcoin DAO Governance Process v3. 3Generally speaking, anyone can make a proposal on the forum and it has to 1) be available for comment for five days and 2) receive comments from five stewards. With those two conditions met, and given the formatting of the proposal was correct, the proposal could move to Snapshot for vote.\n\nThis action proposes Gitcoin move forward with recommended Option #2 which states:\n\nOption 2: Continue to use Passport as a control, using at least GTC = 100 or twitter followers = 1000\nThis option would gate proposals via Gitcoin Passport connected to Snapshot using the existing stamps, which are at least 100GTC tokens held OR 1000 Twitter followers.\n\nSee the link below for full discussion and the options evaluated.",

      "title": "[Proposal] - Amendments to the Steward Council",
      "content": "Preface:\nThis document seeks to amend (not replace) Proposal: V2 of the Steward Council 2which was passed on Snapshot on December 05, 2022.\n\nFor simplicity, this document will capture “amendments” which will update components of the Proposal: V2 of the Steward Council 2. For transparency this document will list the relevant “Original wording” and ”Amended wording” segments of the proposal as well as “rational” for the change.\n\nThere are three amendments this document attempts to capture:\n\nAmendment #1: Removing the specificity of the team composition\nThis is mostly a non material clean up item. This change allows Gitcoin to adjust the number of works streams without adjusting the Steward Council election document.\n\nAmendment #2 Changing meeting type and frequency\nThis change builds on lessons learned that smaller, more targeted time with the external stewards delivered greater value to the Gitcoin workstream leaders. This change reduces “context” time for the external partners and increases targeted time with specific topics relevant to the Gitcoin Workstream leaders.\n\nAmendment #3 Adjustments to the election process\nThis change eliminates the reference to the voting tool and changes the voting mechanism from an egalitarian vote (all voters are weighted equally) to a token weighted vote (more tokens = greater influence). This change also opens voting up to all GTC token holders (who are eligible to vote) vs. the previous approach which whitelisted participation to Gitcoin Stewards.\n\nThe changes in detail:\nAmendment #1: Removing the specificity of the team composition\nOriginal wording:\nTo facilitate a move to an externally-aware advisory body, this proposal changes the team composition to 6 Gitcoin core team delegates and 10 external stewards.\n\nAmended wording:\nTo facilitate a move to an externally-aware advisory body, this proposal changes the team composition to one Gitcoin core team delegate from each workstream and external stewards.\n\nRational:\nThis change would allow Gitcoin to add or remove workstreams without needing to adjust the Steward Council election process.\n\nAmendment #2 Changing meeting type and frequency\nOriginal wording:\n![image](ipfs://bafkreif7rsczflea7y44jpepupgzunwjyrhz7nx52rizbjjmbm52pn6jme)\n    \nAmended wording:\n![image](ipfs://bafkreicl6y3fuvfzelarrmaqjkz6qhunro2rwsjuomi24rjgt2s65sjmfa)\n    \n\nRational:\nBased on the prior season, both workstream leaders and external council members found the 2x’s general reviews did not lead to rich and insightful conversions. They were helpful for maintaining context for the external steward council members - especially when accompanied by pre-reading, but the frequency was too often and added little value to the Gitcoin representatives. Conversely, ad-hoc meetings with specific topics held with a targeted audience of domain experts resulted in better discussion and insight. Based on this information, we propose reducing the general sessions to make room for specific topic reviews as needed by the workstreams.\n\nAmendment #3 Adjustments to the election process\nOriginal wording:\nStep 3: Steward elections:\nThe fifteen nominees (5 workstreams x 3 candidates) will be entered into a quadratic voting pool for a steward vote using https://quadraticvote.co/ 1 1 tool. Existing stewards will vote on nominees using the nominee linked bios found here 2 2. Each steward will receive 10 “votes”, which can be used to vote for up to 10 candidates using the standard quadratic voting methodology. Individual voting links will be distributed via email to voters, and it is the responsibility of the voter to pass along their preferred email address.\n\nThe top 10 of this ranking will be invited to join the Steward council, and the outcome of this Quadratic vote will be considered final. There will be no additional snapshot or Tally vote to ratify the selection of the 10 + 6 steward council members.\n\nAmended wording:\nStep 3: Steward elections:\nThe nominees will be elected via a token weighted quadratic vote. Existing token holders will vote on nominees using the nominee linked bios found here 2 2.\n\nThe top 2/3rds of this ranking will be invited to join the Steward Council, and the outcome of this Quadratic vote will be considered final. There will be no additional snapshot or Tally vote to ratify the selection of the steward council members.\n\nRational:\nIn late 2022 we didn’t have a method to safely execute a token weighted quadratic vote. Today we feel confident that we can execute a sybil resistant token weighted vote using Snapshot, the quadratic voting strategy and Passport. Note, we originally had 15 external nominees, and the top 10 were placed on the council. We change the specification to “2/3rds” so that the number of winners can adjust with the number of workstreams and nominees (2 nominees per workstream).",

      "content": "Following the successful vote on Snapshot, we are moving this proposal to Tally for finalization and disbursement of funds. This request is specifically for the Season 18 funds. Per our governance process, we will request the S19 funds separately as we get closer to that season.\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x2d2bb7898c0e397168fefd01496f835ee8345bbc73f6ead3bd10aefdc54a51a0\n\n# Summary\n### TL;DR\n\nThis season the Gitcoin Allo workstream’s core focus is on establishing product-market fit for web3 grants programs. To get there, we will be executing against two key outcomes:\n\n- Enabling web3 grants programs to run the majority of their funding through Grants Stack\n- Empowering builders to create new software applications on top of Allo protocol\n\n\n### Outline\nAllo is a protocol for democratic resource allocation, which enables communities to easily pool and distribute capital to their needs — Fund What Matters. In order to meet this value proposition, Allo needs to support a wide range of community-oriented resource allocation mechanisms. Up until now, the team has been focused on laying Allo’s foundation and creating a flagship Quadratic Funding experience on the protocol. However, over the course of our Design Partner Program (55+ interviews with ~30 web3 grants programs) we’ve learned that web3 communities tend to employ a wide variety of grant types that are geared to specific use cases. Those partners told us that Quadratic Funding, while popular as a tactic for engaging their broader communities, is generally considered a fit for a minority of those use cases (typically <20% of overall funding). In most cases, the programs want to use higher-touch mechanisms (e.g. committee/expert approvals, milestone-based payments, RFP-style grants, etc) for the bulk of their fund distribution. If we want to truly achieve product-market fit for Allo among web3 communities we’ll need to build additional mechanisms so that we are a viable option for those higher-touch scenarios. Strategically, we feel that building a strong foothold within web3 will give us a foundation for bringing our public good to additional communities.\n\nIn Season 18 and 19 we are going to pursue a two-pronged approach to building this strategic base. The first is Grants Stack — our primary interface for using Allo today. We want to ensure that it’s offering web3 communities a delightful entry-point to running grant programs. Our work here will be focused on expanding the types of grant programs that can be run through our three dApps (i.e. hitting our 13-5-5 goal of 13 QF rounds, 5 QV rounds, and 5 Direct Grants programs by September 1), continuing to improve the user experience, and establishing the next wave of our strategy once 13-5-5 has been achieved. The second prong is core Allo protocol. We want Allo to be a truly decentralized public good, and the work in this swimlane will be focused on enabling other builders to create apps on top of Allo. Tactically, that will likely be things like advancing the core protocol’s capabilities and assisting other teams with their builds.\n\n### Amount\n\nAllo is requesting 1,197,358 GTC* = $1,640,380 for S18, assuming 1.37 USD/GTC.",

Per our governance process, we will request the S19 funds separately as we get closer to that season. \n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x2d2bb7898c0e397168fefd01496f835ee8345bbc73f6ead3bd10aefdc54a51a0\n\n# Summary  \n\n**TL;DR**  \n\nThis season the Gitcoin Allo workstream’s core focus is on establishing product-market fit for web3 grants programs. To get there, we will be executing against two key outcomes:  \n\n- Enabling web3 grants programs to run the majority of their funding through Grants Stack\n- Empowering builders to create new software applications on top of Allo protocol   \n\n  \n**Outline**   \nAllo is a protocol for democratic resource allocation, which enables communities to easily pool and distribute capital to their needs — Fund What Matters. In order to meet this value proposition, Allo needs to support a wide range of community-oriented resource allocation mechanisms. Up until now, the team has been focused on laying Allo’s foundation and creating a flagship Quadratic Funding experience on the protocol. However, over the course of our Design Partner Program (55+ interviews with ~30 web3 grants programs) we’ve learned that web3 communities tend to employ a wide variety of grant types that are geared to specific use cases. Those partners told us that Quadratic Funding, while popular as a tactic for engaging their broader communities, is generally considered a fit for a minority of those use cases (typically <20% of overall funding). In most cases, the programs want to use higher-touch mechanisms (e.g. committee/expert approvals, milestone-based payments, RFP-style grants, etc) for the bulk of their fund distribution. If we want to truly achieve product-market fit for Allo among web3 communities we’ll need to build additional mechanisms so that we are a viable option for those higher-touch scenarios. Strategically, we feel that building a strong foothold within web3 will give us a foundation for bringing our public good to additional communities.\n\nIn Season 18 and 19 we are going to pursue a two-pronged approach to building this strategic base. The first is Grants Stack — our primary interface for using Allo today. We want to ensure that it’s offering web3 communities a delightful entry-point to running grant programs. Our work here will be focused on expanding the types of grant programs that can be run through our three dApps (i.e. hitting our 13-5-5 goal of 13 QF rounds, 5 QV rounds, and 5 Direct Grants programs by September 1), continuing to improve the user experience, and establishing the next wave of our strategy once 13-5-5 has been achieved. The second prong is core Allo protocol. We want Allo to be a truly decentralized public good, and the work in this swimlane will be focused on enabling other builders to create apps on top of Allo. Tactically, that will likely be things like advancing the core protocol’s capabilities and assisting other teams with their builds.\n\n**Amount**   \n\nAllo is requesting 1,197,358 GTC* = $1,640,380 for S18, assuming 1.37 USD/GTC.",

(Quadratic Experimentation and Development) Program \nHow can Gitcoin leverage the lessons learned from its past experiments to address the limitations of the current Quadratic Funding model and refine it for future applications?\n\nGiven the multiple cohorts which exist and commit extractive and exploitative attacks on Gitcoin Grants and our Web3 partners, what novel solutions can Gitcoin explore to enhance the security and fairness of the Quadratic Funding model?\n\nIn the pursuit of next-generation allocation mechanisms, how can Gitcoin ensure a more representative and pluralistic environment for its Grants Programs and QV governance models?\n\nWe present the Q.E.D. (Quadratic Experimentation and Development) program, which aims to answer those questions through the development and implementation of collusion-resistant Quadratic Funding mechanisms for Gitcoin Grants. The project lead for Q.E.D. has developed state-of-the-art collusion-resistant QF mechanisms 2 in collaboration with leaders in the field 1, and brings to the table an ability to rigorously understand the unique needs of Allo Protocol. Q.E.D.'s aim is to create a more inclusive and democratic funding model that addresses collusion and improves the efficiency and fairness of the funding process, as well as to educate our prospective and current partners about the trade-offs that can be made in their own Allo use-cases.\n\nProposal\nWe propose to deliver the following:\n\n1. A tailored mathematical framework for understanding QF within Gitcoin’s context.\n2. Empirical analysis of collusion-resistant mechanisms using Gitcoin Grants data.\n3. Product roadmap with recommendations for data collection practices and Gitcoin Allo/ Passport feature analysis.\n4. Series of articles for marketing, educational, and onboarding purposes.\n5. Bi-weekly updates to the Gitcoin community.\n\n\nVote\nTo be clear: a “yes” vote for this project is not a vote to change Gitcoin’s core QF algorithm. It’s a vote to fund R&D aimed at giving Gitcoin a button it could press to change the core QF algorithm.\n\nVoting “Yes”: By voting “yes,” you support the implementation of the Q.E.D. program. This includes allocating the necessary funds for staffing costs ($27,240 in USDC), as well as the commitment to collaborate with leading experts in the field to ensure the program’s success.\n\nVoting “No”: By voting “no,” you indicate that you do not support the implementation of the Q.E.D. program at this time, either due to concerns about costs, potential drawbacks, or other factors. This would mean that the core logic of the current QF mechanism would remain unchanged, and the resources allocated for this proposal would not be utilized for the Q.E.D. program.\n\nTo see the details of this proposal - see the forum topic linked below ",

      "content": "Gitcoin Allo S18-S19 Workstream Budget Proposal\n\nThis is the integrated funding proposal for the Gitcoin Allo Workstream requesting funding for Season 18 and S19 (1 May 2023 through 31 October 2023), authored by @kevin.olsen, @nategosselin, and @Sor03. This budget request has been deeply reviewed by CSDO, as well as some of our top Stewards, including @griff, @lthrift, @annika, @epowell101. We invite you to offer feedback, ask questions and help us identify any blindspots we may have. Coordination starts at the governance layer, and we need you to make us better.\n\nTL;DR\nThis season the Gitcoin Allo workstream’s core focus is on establishing product-market fit for web3 grants programs. To get there, we will be executing against two key outcomes:\n\n- Enabling web3 grants programs to run the majority of their funding through Grants Stack\n- Empowering builders to create new software applications on top of Allo protocol\n\nOutline\nAllo is a protocol for democratic resource allocation, which enables communities to easily pool and distribute capital to their needs — Fund What Matters. In order to meet this value proposition, Allo needs to support a wide range of community-oriented resource allocation mechanisms. Up until now, the team has been focused on laying Allo’s foundation and creating a flagship Quadratic Funding experience on the protocol. However, over the course of our Design Partner Program (55+ interviews with ~30 web3 grants programs) we’ve learned that web3 communities tend to employ a wide variety of grant types that are geared to specific use cases. Those partners told us that Quadratic Funding, while popular as a tactic for engaging their broader communities, is generally considered a fit for a minority of those use cases (typically <20% of overall funding). In most cases, the programs want to use higher-touch mechanisms (e.g. committee/expert approvals, milestone-based payments, RFP-style grants, etc) for the bulk of their fund distribution. If we want to truly achieve product-market fit for Allo among web3 communities we’ll need to build additional mechanisms so that we are a viable option for those higher-touch scenarios. Strategically, we feel that building a strong foothold within web3 will give us a foundation for bringing our public good to additional communities.\n\nIn Season 18 and 19 we are going to pursue a two-pronged approach to building this strategic base. The first is Grants Stack — our primary interface for using Allo today. We want to ensure that it’s offering web3 communities a delightful entry-point to running grant programs. Our work here will be focused on expanding the types of grant programs that can be run through our three dApps (i.e. hitting our 13-5-5 goal of 13 QF rounds, 5 QV rounds, and 5 Direct Grants programs by September 1), continuing to improve the user experience, and establishing the next wave of our strategy once 13-5-5 has been achieved. The second prong is core Allo protocol. We want Allo to be a truly decentralized public good, and the work in this swimlane will be focused on enabling other builders to create apps on top of Allo. Tactically, that will likely be things like advancing the core protocol’s capabilities and assisting other teams with their builds.\n\nAmount\nAllo is requesting 2,031,127 GTC* = $3,229,491 for S18-19, assuming 1.59 USD/GTC, excluding reserves and rolled over amounts.\n\nView 3: Total request including reserves & budget rollover\nTotal [Workstream] Budgeted Spend S18-S19\t$2,821,533\n60 Day Reserves\t                                                      $940,511\nS17 Treasury Balance, incl unspent *\t                  $538,874\nTotal S18-19 Request\t                                            $3,223,170\n*Any and all revenue generated during the past season will flow back to the DAO treasury or will be rolled over to the next season.\n\nDetails of this proposal can be found in the link below.",

      "title": "[GCP-008] S18 Discord Management",
      "content": "Summary:\nDiscord Management within the DAO was previously funded by the DAOops workstream, which is closing operations at the end of Season 17. Moving forward, we look to the GCP process as a mechanism to fund operational & organizational efficiency within one of our primary community & working hubs: Discord.\n\nScope:\nI propose funding Discord management to do five things:\n\nContinue addressing daily server management tasks and contributor requests.\na) Respond to DAO contributor access, channel/role creation, and help/informational requests within 24 hours.\nb) Tracking of server insights and metrics to spot suspicious activity\nc) Regular checking of role access to various channels and the ongoing need for these roles\nd) Regular checking of activity across channels to ensure stale channels are archived when they become stale\ne) Continued maintenance and monitoring of bots for active use, relevant updates, server security/automation, and community engagement\n\nFacilitate coordination and strategy between workstreams, working groups, and community groups within Discord.\na) Suggest proper & scalable approaches toward implementing new working groups or growing existing ones\nb) Creation & maintenance of admin-level roles for individual workstream, guild, and pod maintenance\n\nContinue documenting best practices and how-to guides for contributors.\na) These are developed as needed. Examples include a Discord best practices guide, a kick/ban policy, a bot access tracker, a guide to playing music in Discord, and Discord channel structure/role access documentation\n\nContinue the development, maintenance, and user training of the Gitcoin Sentry bot as an in-house security tool.\na) The Gitcoin Sentry bot is an internally-developed bot that provides access to mass-moderation commands and unique server security functionalities, such as targeted pruning and public-channel monitoring, not offered by other bots. In addition to the continued development of this bot, a series of documentation providing usage guidance will be developed and shared with DAO Core members and any other contributor with administrative-level access on any level within the server\n\nCoordinate the development of a ChatGPT response bot\na) We will aim to introduce a ChatGPT-powered bot to quickly respond to community questions with answers from our Knowledge Base and assist with wayfinding within the server and broader Gitcoin Community. This bot will improve citizen comfort and engagement while reducing the contributor strain of additionally monitoring the active public channels to assist grantees and other citizens experiencing issues or that have questions\n\nBenefits:\nRetain high context tooling contributor who understands the DAO, its organizational structure, and the needs across workstreams/working groups\nMaintenance of a healthy, safe, and efficient working space\nQuickly respond to emergent contributor requests and potential scams/raids\nContinued development of bots to improve security, contributor productivity, and community support/engagement\nRisk assessment:\nUsing the GCPs process to fund high-context work could lead to a loss of resources due to the seasonal instability of the role\nNot funding this work will mean the existing work must be stopped or reassigned to existing resources\nBudget:\nAn estimate based on the history of filling this role suggests this work requires one contributor operating at a part-time capacity, or approximately 30 hours per week for the 13 week season.\n\nPayments would be distributed by one Tally vote for the season or by individual Tally votes at the end of each month.\n\nThis role will require access to “core contributor” tools such as Discord (with “moderator” access), email, g-suite, miro, etc. There is no consideration for vacation, travel, training, severance, conferences, or other ancillary DAO/workstream contributor benefits.\n\n30 hours/week * 13 weeks = 390 hours total. 390 hours at $60 per hour = $23,400\n\nTotal request: $23,400*\n\n*All spending will be tracked, including hours committed. Any unused funds will be sent back to the treasury at the end of the season if a consecutive GCP is not passed.\n\nTimeline:\nThe season would start on May 1 and conclude on July 31, for a total of 13 weeks. There would be no severance should the service not be renewed.\n\nSuccess Metrics:\nWhat metrics, outcomes, or deliverables should be used to verify the project met expectations? Said another way, after the project is complete, what measures will you use to confirm the project met or did not meet the outcomes listed in the “motivation”.\n\nContinuous Discord role & channel maintenance and re-organization, focused on reducing overwhelming views and promoting efficient coordination\nResponse to DAO contributor requests & access issues with a response time of <24 hours\nImmediate response to raid attempts\nRelease of and proper documentation for the Gitcoin Sentry bot\nRelease of and proper documentation for the ChatGPT response bot\nContinued documentation & guidance on best practices for navigating/using Discord as a contributor, lead, or workstream Discord Manager (e.g., Discord best practices guide, kick/ban policy, bot access, playing music in Discord, discord channel structure) to promote clarity, context, and introduce shared processes to maintain organizational consistency\nContinued training sessions on special cases as they arise (e.g., banning, entry flow, wayfinding within the server, onboarding/offboarding, where to look for documentation, how to receive support)\nContinuous implementation & maintenance of external and internal bots to aid contributor security, increase productivity, and engage our community\nOverall positive sentiment from active DAO contributors\n\nVote:\nFor - Fund Discord Management $23,400 for Season 18\nAgainst - Do not fund Discord Management for Season 18",

This being the case, we look to the GCP process as a mechanism to fund base operational governance, while leaving room for aspirational governance innovation via subsequent GPC proposals.\n\nAbstract:\n\nWhen compared to traditional business, governance is one of the key components that changes within the DAO. Broadly, the goal of optimized governance in a DAO is to reduce the friction within the DAO, increase productivity, and to capture the intent of the community in a way that multiplies the network effect with a view towards long term outcomes. To meet this need, this proposal is built in a way to minimally facilitate steward governance, get the greatest value out of our governing bodies, and to act as an impartial arbiter of the governance process. Additionally, this GCP would be staffed in a way to quickly adapt to critical governance outages and some operational improvements.\n\nThis is an experiment and we know there are risks associated with using a temporary funding mechanism like the GCP for operational work. An outcome of this experiment will be a recommendation on if GCPs are appropriate for this kind of work or if the DAO should find another way to staff the work.\n\nVote:\nFor - Fund Gitcoin Governance $20800 for Season 18\nFor - Fund Gitcoin Governance $41600 for Season 18 & 19\nAgainst - Do not fund Gitcoin Governance for Season 18 or 19\nAbstain\n\nDetails of this proposal can be found in the link below.",

      "content": "### TL;DR\nThis season, the Gitcoin Passport workstream will drive significant impact in the Gitcoin ecosystem by focusing on the following key outcomes:\n\n1. Growing adoption and usage of Passport through development of on-chain mechanisms, user experience improvements, and broader DevRel initiatives.\n2. Generating upside through strategic tests, including at least two revenue experiments, to identify sustainable value capture mechanisms that contribute to the long-term sustainability of the Gitcoin Passport App and the DAO.\n3. Gathering a plurality of scoring mechanisms for communities to adopt, encouraging innovation from the broader community and making Passport a more versatile tool for managing identity and reputation.\n4. Galvanizing community experiences around Passport by researching and potentially enabling custom community experiences, integration capabilities, and branded Passport experiences natively in their applications.\n\n### Measurement\nMeasuring progress against these goals will be critically important:\n\n*Growing adoption*\n1. Increase the number of Passports by 5x (to 1MM)\n2. Maintain an average stamp count of 8 or higher per passport.\n3. Increase the number of integrators by 5x\n\n*Generating upside*\n1. Test at least two experiments to generate upside\n2. Generate at least $1 in revenue\n\n*Gathering a plurality of Scoring Mechanisms*\n1. Ensure at least 5 scoring mechanisms available to communities\n2. Ensure at least 4 of the scoring mechanisms are used\n\n*Galvanize community experiences*\n1. Research and decide if we should build custom community experiences.\n\n### Economics\nPassport Workstream is requesting 832,372 GTC* = $1,323,472 for S18-19, excluding reserves and rolled over amounts.\n\n**The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.*\n\n*We will be requesting our funds through one Snapshot vote, but the release of the actual funds will be split over two Tally votes (one at the start of each season) for reasons of accountability and to mitigate potential price fluctuations.*",

We have run 105 quadratic funding rounds, helped fund over 3,700 projects, and grown ecosystems like Uniswap, Polygon, and ENS. Yet, we aren’t currently using quadratic funding ourselves. With the recent launch of the Allo protocol, Gitcoin should be one of the first ecosystems to use the protocol to fund its shared needs.\n\nThis proposal is to pilot a series of quadratic funding rounds for rewarding efforts supporting the Gitcoin Community, specifically by Gitcoin Citizens 2. Citizens are value-aligned community members who are eager to contribute their time and skills in service of the DAO. Running these rounds will lower the barrier of entry for contributing to the DAO, determine what the community values most, and help test (dogfood) the Allo protocol.\n\nFor this, we are requesting a total of $95K in GTC from the Gitcoin treasury. Please refer to the gov post: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gcp-004-passed-gitcoin-citizens-round/13462/12 and the Snapshot vote for the full details of the proposal.",

      "title": "[GCP-004] Gitcoin Citizens Round",
      "content": "Summary\nGitcoin is the world’s largest implementer of quadratic funding. We have run 105 quadratic funding rounds, helped fund over 3,700 projects, and grown ecosystems like Uniswap, Polygon, and ENS. Yet, we aren’t currently using quadratic funding ourselves. With the recent launch of the Allo protocol, Gitcoin should be one of the first ecosystems to use the protocol to fund its shared needs.\n\nThis proposal is to pilot a series of quadratic funding rounds for rewarding efforts supporting the Gitcoin Community, specifically by Gitcoin Citizens 2. Citizens are value-aligned community members who are eager to contribute their time and skills in service of the DAO. Running these rounds will lower the barrier of entry for contributing to the DAO, determine what the community values most, and help test (dogfood) the Allo protocol.\n\nFor this we are requesting a total of $95K in GTC from the Gitcoin treasury, more details below.*\n\nAbstract\nThrough using our protocol and products, we’ll be able to better understand what works and what could be improved from both a funding and technology perspective.\n\nIn particular, we’ll be able to test two different approaches to quadratic funding: normal QF and retroQF. Normal QF (the kind we see in Grants Rounds) can fund both completed and planned work, while RetroQF exclusively funds work which has already had an observable impact. Because of this, RetroQF may be better at distributing funds according to the value actually created by a contribution but is not suited to situations where contributors can’t afford to wait for compensation. We will try both methods to gain information about which is better suited to the unique needs of our community.\n\nBy running different styles of rounds repeatedly and quickly, we’ll be able to gain valuable insight into how to best fund grantees, improve our products, and empower our community. We will also identify what contributions our community finds valuable so that in subsequent rounds people have more information when choosing what to work on.\n\nFull details can be found on the governance forums listed below!",

A suitable example of a case to reconsider a vote would be if there is new information that, if known prior to the vote, might have changed the outcome of the vote.\n\nTo note, this process is designed for situations where any new material information is brought to light, or there is a significant environmental change. In the case of new information being brought to light, it does not pass judgment on if the new information was asymmetrically unavailable (information was withheld, obfuscated, or omitted) or if new information was previously unknown and has recently been discovered.\n\nThe web3 space changes rapidly and good governance processes protect against the implementation of bad choices, but it also needs to be flexible enough to rapidly adjust as new information as it is made available. Without a controlled process in place, the DAO is at risk for being forced to implement outdated decisions, move in an uncoordinated fashion, or make inappropriate or unauthorized declarations in order to repeal decisions in a way that might cause the entire governance process to be called into question.\n\nFull details can be found on the governance forums listed below!\n",

To do so, we are requesting a budget of $414,041.\n\nOur top priorities for this season include:\n\n- A successful marketing push at ETHDenver, including:\n  - Development of a microsite that will live at evolution.gitcoin.co featuring launch of Grants Stack, our new visual identity and Quadratic Funding Record release with Metalabel\n  - Running the Schelling Point conference (with the support of Supermodular as a contractor)\n  - A PR/media relations push (with the support of YAP Global)\n  - Coordinated efforts around consistent messaging for anyone speaking on stage at ETHDenver & bolstering these talks with related online content to capture audiences not present at ETH Denver\n- Launching a new gitcoin.co website\n- Finalize the Gitcoin Grants Stack, Allo Protocol, and Passport branding strategies and visual identities\n- Launch the first version of a living Impact Report that highlights the success of the Gitcoin Grants Program\n- Relaunch Passport and double down on marketing/education efforts from a content and creative perspective\n- Provide marketing support for the Grants Program in April\n\n**Amount**\nMMM’s S17 budget is $414,041 (-12.27% change vs S16 budget). After accounting for remaining budget & reserves, **MMM is requesting $122,069 for Season 17 from the treasury.**\n\nYou can find the snapshot vote here: https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0xb39cf2f698f8756eafe9378479b69dc28f563d64fc1c64afddbc5374a206d2fa",

That seed funding should come from the Matching Pool as the yield accrued will be used in the matching pool in the future (and we can always sell the LP position and recover our assets if we need them in the short term).\n\n**Vote**\nThis vote that will accomplish the following (a yes vote would do…):\n\n1 - Formalize the relationship between us and Index Coop and enable co-branding and marketing of the new gtcETH product (if it passes the Index Coop governance)\n\n2 - Move 100 ETH from the matching pool multi sig to fund two LP positions (50ETH each LP):\n2.1 pair gtcETH against dsETH in a 1bp pool\n2.2 pair gtcETH against ETH in a 5bps pool\n(The two pools ensure deeper liquidity and reduce swapping fees for moving into gtcETH while also ensuring arb opportunities exist between dsETH and gtcETH to ensure they stay near parity in price)\n\nWork with Index Coop to rebalance the product on a ~quarterly/monthly cadence as needed.\n\nA no vote would prevent us from funding the initial liquidity, but may not materially change Index Coop’s decision to build and launch the product for us.",

Our two Allo-focused outcomes are:\nEnable Payouts v1\nEngage the developer community\n\nGrants Stack: The primary goal in S17 is productizing QF rounds on Grants Stack. We received valuable feedback during our alpha period and want to focus on addressing so both our Grants Program and self-serve customers can run successful QF rounds. Our outcomes are:\nImprove the project application and review flows\nBuild a project reputation system\nProvide an easy, intuitive QF round experience\n\nOur request is to have funding to fulfill these objectives as outlined in our governance post. Gitcoin Allo (GA) is requesting $803,533 for S17, and we plan to maintain a standard reserve of 60%. Due to price increases from when the S16 budget was funded, absorbing the Moonshot Collective treasury, and strong diversification, we are actually only requesting roughly 165K GTC ($290K) this season to maintain our full budget and reserves.\n\n*The GTC total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally. In this post, we used a $1.75 conversion rate.

To do so, we are requesting a budget of $414,041.\n\nOur top priorities for this season include:\n\n- A successful marketing push at ETHDenver, including:\n    - Development of a microsite that will live at evolution.gitcoin.co featuring launch of Grants Stack, our new visual identity and Quadratic Funding Record release with Metalabel\n    - Running the Schelling Point conference (with the support of Supermodular as a contractor)\n    - A PR/media relations push (with the support of YAP Global)\n    - Coordinated efforts around consistent messaging for anyone speaking on stage at ETHDenver & bolstering these talks with related online content to capture audiences not present at ETH Denver\n- Launching a new gitcoin.co website\n- Finalize the Gitcoin Grants Stack, Allo Protocol, and Passport branding strategies and visual identities\n- Launch the first version of a living Impact Report that highlights the success of the Gitcoin Grants Program\n- Relaunch Passport and double down on marketing/education efforts from a content and creative perspective\n- Provide marketing support for the Grants Program in April\n\nAmount\n\nMMM’s S17 budget is $414,041 (-12.27% change vs S16 budget).

In S16, we will continue to support key initiatives to support contributor professional development, and with budget increases to support the success of our Grants Program and Protocol development. Also, in light of recent shifts in our community engagement strategy, we will be winding down our Community Experience initiative to focus even more on cross-stream collaboration, accountability and project management across the DAO.\n\nBased on what we learned in S15, we will be focusing our resources on supporting DAO and contributor success vis-a-vis our cross-stream DAO operations, governance, tooling, people operations and success initiatives.\n\nBudget Request\n\nDAO Ops requests $348,260 USD* in S16. Included in the budget is a placeholder for a Technical Support hire to support our Design Partner Program and 2 months of parental leave for 1 contributor. This request does not include the additional 60 days of reserves per season. A breakdown of the full budget can be found at the end of this proposal.\n\n*The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.\n\nMore in our full proposal [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s16-proposal-integrated-dao-operations-budget-request/11811)",

This will include re-thinking the eligibility policy requirements, designing robust processes, operations, and services to easily scale protocol rounds, all while testing and delivering alpha rounds on the protocol in S16.\n\nIn S16 we will prioritize successfully transitioning our partners and grantees to the protocol. To help operationalize this, we will build out a services arm of PGF to further accommodate instances of the protocol with a revenue model to drive toward financial sustainability. \n\n# Budget Request\n\nPGF budget request in S16 is 868,750 USD for S16. This amount does not include a re-up of our 60 day reserves, and the full budget breakdown can be found at the end of this post.\n\nNotably the increase in budget request is due to a developer relations budget (requested by GPC for us to take on) that will ensure protocol launch success, a new senior hire as a services lead, and a retreat for core Web3 ecosystem community leaders that have either been key supporters of Gitcoin or key figures in the community to rally around the Grants Protocol launch announcement during EthDenver.\n\n*The GTC total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally.

(Same as S15) \n\nThe total amount requested from the treasury is $384,151*\n\n*1) The amount of GTC requested and the value of the reserves will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally using the lower of the current price or the 20 day moving average, whichever is lower.\n\n*2) FDD received $220,000 in reserves at a GTC price of $1.95 in S14. With a GTC price of $1.66, these reserves are worth $198,349. The full amount (100%) will be rolled over to the Season 16 budget request.\n\nTL;DR\n\nIn Season 16, FDD will focus on building open source fraud defense tools to support the DAOs overall transition to the protocol. It will be done by building on our season 15 hackathon success of starting an engaged OpenData community, dogfooding our tools during gitcoin led rounds, and finding sustainable models for continued defense for Gitcoin UI, Gitcoin Grants Program, & Community Grants Programs.\n\nWe will improve our ability to quickly discover and build a modular fraud defense system (consisting of open source “LEGOS”) that communities and round owners can use to reduce fraud, allocate resources better, and promote learning between ecosystems on the new grants protocol.\n\nIn addition, by talking with round owners, we will find sustainable funding options for continuous fraud defense provided by the OpenData community.",

If this vote is successful, we will begin preparing for a protocol-driven, streamlined and tightly-scoped GR16.\n\nYou can vote \n\nFOR \n\nor\n\nAGAINST \n\nThe approach for GR16 detailed below: \n\nGitcoin will run a streamlined alpha round on the protocol in mid-January 2023 for our oldest running rounds: Open Source Software, Ethereum Infrastructure, and Climate. \n\nEach round will run with a subset of existing grantees to ensure we have the capacity to provide support during the transition, that the most dependent grantees receive the funding they rely on, and that we are able to work with the community to intentionally receive feedback and build out operational services to support scaling future rounds soon. \n\nThis option takes into account the desire to run a streamlined round in GR16, not lose momentum, and ensure when we launch at scale in early Q2, 2023 on the protocol that it is more stable and reliable for grantees, both technically and operationally. \n",

Much of this work will be focused on creating solid marketing foundations for our protocols while also growing our community and grants programs.\n\nIn addition to aligning and driving strategic marketing initiatives, our S15 priorities will include social media management, analytics, content development, and protocol branding work.\n\nBelow is a list of our top 6 priorities for the next 90 days:\n- Branding for the Protocols suite including new names, a narrative framework, visual identity, and robust content plan\n- Onboarding a fractional product marketing manager to support the launch of the protocols suite\n- Create a comprehensive grants program marketing strategy in partnership with with PGF\n- Publish grantee success stories in the form of blog posts and case studies\n- Develop clear guidelines for what “community engagement” means and looks like at Gitcoin through a community engagement strategy (in collaboration with PGF and DAO Ops)\n- Successful co-marketing partnership product partnership launches with Optimism and Fantom",

The total request is for $582,500 minus the rollover of season 14 reserves. \n\nFDD did not spend any of the $220,000 which was budgeted for S14 reserves.This amount was received from Tally at a cost basis of $2.99 and would be $242,810 at today’s GTC price of $3.30. The value of these reserves and the amount requested will be calculated in GTC using the lower of the 20 day moving average or the spot price, whichever is lower at the time this budget is posted to Tally. \n\nTL:DR\n\nIn Season 15, FDD aims to provide the Gitcoin community with the knowledge that matching funds are allocated as optimally as possible within the given set of assumptions and constraints. One focus will be operationally executing the fraud detection & defense needs of the Gitcoin main/Ethereum round & any other community moderated rounds. The second is assisting Gitcoin Product Collective with operational insights, quantitative analysis, and algorithmic/mechanism design research.\nBased on what we learned in Season 14, we will improve our communication during the season to remove confusion regarding FDD priorities, purpose, and alignment with GitcoinDAO.\n\n\nFor more details please see this post: \nhttps://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s15-proposal-integrated-fdd-budget-request/11224",

This budget request is to fund the MC community (2 lean teams of 1 PM & 2 devs) to be the first to build on the Grants & Passport protocols. We plan to build composable modules that are valuable to those protocols and its design partners. These composable modules were identified as the most valuable through a collaboration w/ the Gitcoin Product Collective (GPC) workstream.\n\nOverall, the impact/value of our work will help ensure the protocols are approachable, drive adoption of the protocols and increase financial sustainability through increasing GTC Utility.\n\nFor more details, please see this post: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s15-proposal-integrated-moonshot-collective-budget-request/11214",

      "content": "tl;dr: As we get closer to launching our protocol, we want to extend our governance participation to a few new partners by exchanging governance tokens with stable tokens. This will put the governance tokens into the hands of strategic partners who can help us improve our protocol while also diversifying our treasury to ensure we can continue our mission in a larger crypto winter.\n\n## Details\nIn January we discussed and agreed that diversifying our treasury to hedge against large market down turns would be in our best interest as it would also invite strategic partners to participate in our governance future. This vote is to formalize that intent and extend governance rights to those partners who have shown interest and are aligned to our mission.\n\nVoting Yes on this proposal will enable us to withdraw $10MM of GTC to be used for diversification of governing ownership. We will use the same gnosis safe from our past vote to diversify our treasury. The signers on that Multisig are:\n\n- Myself (Kyle)\n- Annika\n- Shreyas Hariharan\n- Kris\n- Simona\n- James / Fire Eyes\n\nThe full terms of the diversification can be found in the governance post and links below. Here is a quick summary:\n- 17.5% discount on 30day price average\n- 1 year lock up with a linear 1 year unlock there after (2 years fully unlocked).\n- We will use Hedgey to help facilitate the trade and lock up.\n\nHere are a few links to read more: \nSnapshot vote for previously passed TD (with gnosis safe details): https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x0eb45cfd31ddd2701af3d74ce38a9e87292fe42a6b40b26812ff9889b07daeb3\n\nTreasury Diversification rationale on the governance forums:\nhttps://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-treasury-diversification/9698\n\nUpdate on terms:\nhttps://gov.gitcoin.co/t/treasury-diversification-part-ii-welcoming-strategic-partners/9825/4\n\nA No vote would be to reject the terms or the idea of diversifying. This will likely kill the effort entirely as the terms have already been negotiated and I dont think we have any more room to change them.\n\n",

      "content": "**Summary**\n\nWe propose moving $3 million of GTC (~1.35m GTC at time of writing) to a multisig wallet to execute the previously proposed treasury diversification. This will be exchanged for USDC via an agency desk in order to support critical DAO workstream funding needs. Any GTC that remains after the strategic diversification will be returned to the treasury. Given current market conditions and Gitcoin's operating needs, we think this is a prudent action to take.\n\n**State of GitcoinDAO’s Treasury**\n\nToday, GitcoinDAO’s treasury holds 23m GTC (roughly $57.1m). GitcoinDAO’s Treasury Vester holds another 26m GTC which will be distributed to the DAO over time.\n\nThe vast majority of the DAO’s treasury is held in GTC, with very little in stablecoins. At the end of May, the DAO held $280k in DAI and USDC.\n\n**Rationale for Exchange**\n\nIndividual DAO workstreams have been funded in GTC and are now facing an asset-liability mismatch. Many contributors have wages denominated in USD terms, yet workstreams only have GTC with which to pay said contributors. With the market downturn, workstreams now face an increased risk of not being able to meet these obligations. We wanted to quickly ensure that workstreams can meet their obligations.\n\nWe’re engaging with a reputable agency desk to execute this transaction. The agency desk will utilize a broad range of liquidity sources to execute the transaction with approximately 10 bps of slippage or less. The agency desk will charge 20 bps as a fee and will likely be able to execute the transaction within 3-5 days. This will ensure that each workstream has the stables needed to meet near term expenses.\n\nWe’ve proposed working with a trusted agency desk on the transaction as an alternative to requiring workstreams to sell GTC on the open market, which would be inefficient, costly, and operationally riskier.\n\n**Other Notes**\n\nAny GTC that remains after these actions will be sent back to the treasury.\n\n**Execution**\n\nWe will transfer ~$3m in GTC to a multisig address consisting of the following Gitcoin Stewards as signers:\n\n - Kyle | kbw.eth\n - Annika | wombat.eth\n - Shreyas Hariharan\n - Kris\n - Simona\n - James / Fire Eyes\n\nThis is the multisig address: 0x85e01c9E286A6b2bbc816Cf862911572eaa34F04. Kyle will then execute the diversification into stablecoins via the agency desk.\n",

GitcoinDAO’s [Treasury Vester](https://etherscan.io/address/0x44aa9c5a034c1499ec27906e2d427b704b567ffe) holds another 26m GTC which will be distributed to the DAO over time.\n\nThe vast majority of the DAO’s treasury is held in GTC, with very little in stablecoins. At the end of May, the DAO held $280k in DAI and USDC.\n\n### Rationale for Exchange\n\nIndividual DAO workstreams have been funded in GTC and are now facing an asset-liability mismatch. Many contributors have wages denominated in USD terms, yet workstreams only have GTC with which to pay said contributors. With the market downturn, workstreams now face an increased risk of not being able to meet these obligations. We wanted to quickly ensure that workstreams can meet their obligations.\n\nWe’re engaging with a reputable agency desk to execute this transaction. The agency desk will utilize a broad range of liquidity sources to execute the transaction with approximately 10 bps of slippage or less. The agency desk will charge 20 bps as a fee and will likely be able to execute the transaction within 3 days. This will ensure that each workstream has the stables needed to meet near term expenses.\n\nWe’ve proposed working with a trusted agency desk on the transaction as an alternative to requiring workstreams to sell GTC on the open market, which would be inefficient, costly, and operationally riskier.\n\n### Other Notes\n\nAny GTC that remains after these two actions will be sent back to the treasury.\n\n### Execution\n\nWe will create the on-chain proposal to transfer GTC from the treasury to a 5/6 multisig. Signers on the multisig will be the the following Gitcoin Stewards:\n\n* Kyle Weiss\n* Annika Lewis\n* Shreyas Hariharan\n* Kris\n* Simona\n* James / Fire Eyes\n\nA Snapshot proposal will be posted to Gitcoin’s Snapshot for a community vote.

      "title": "Ratify Foundation changes, DAO gov updates and asset transfer",
      "content": "tl;dr - there are three core categories of changes we seek to ratify:\n1 - Foundation updates to adopt new M&A docs, new bylaws and to convert the foundation to an ownerless foundation\n2 - DAO updates to adopt the v3 gov process that was is live on the forums\n3 - Asset Transfer updates to approve the negotiations with Gitcoin Holdings to take ownership of the network, Gitcoin trademark, assets and liability for those assets, socials, etc.\n\nFoundation Updates:\nWe have a new set of proposed governing documents for the Foundation that would memorialize the Foundation’s operating rules. These include a new Memorandum of Association and Bylaws. These docs have been reviewed by community members (including friends at LexDAO, and our own legal counsel) without any objections, and at this time we believe they are ready to be submitted for approval and ratification. These documents generally direct the Foundation to carry out DAO governance decisions (per our governance process - see update below), subject to statutory or other legal limits. They also allow the Foundation or its subsidiaries to spend capital within its control (ie assets transferred, not the treasury) to advance protocol development until Grants 2.0 is operational and comply with legal and other core requirements (like establishing AML processes, hiring accounting firms, etc).\n\nAs part of the ratification of the updated governing documents for the Foundation, it will also become “ownerless”, meaning it will have no shareholders to whom fiduciary duties or other obligations are owed (one shareholder was initially required to be able to form it under Cayman law) and instead will be able to act in accordance with DAO governance without any obligations to any equity holders.\n\nOperating as an ownerless foundation will, however, increase the complexity for KYC purposes, including anti-money laundering and sanctions laws compliance, and also for certain other diligence purposes and interactions with the real world. But we believe that any such inconvenience is a worthwhile trade-off to establish a structure and environment where the DAO can truly direct the development of the Foundation long term.\n\nIn addition to the Foundation, we have formed 3 subsidiaries to help protect the Foundation’s assets and structure its interactions with the real world. One of these subsidiaries will be a holding company for Gitcoin trademarks and certain other intellectual property (such as our monorepo). The second subsidiary will serve as our primary operating entity and will be responsible for activities such as paying for our domain names, safeguarding and allocating our treasury per DAO governance, engaging and paying ordinary vendors (such as Google and AWS), and serving as the counterparty to DAO contributor agreements. For those contributing to the DAO, this also means you will have a contributor agreement that we hope will help offer more structure, clarity and protection to both you and the Foundation when you perform work on behalf of the DAO); and (iii) a third entity that was created to custody the Gitcoin Grants Multisig (mostly to handle KYC and AML).\n\nWe are in the process of formalizing a few external service providers, such as a KYC/AML compliance officer and an accounting firm and we will continue to retain external legal counsel for any legal needs and questions that arise. As with starting any new entity, there are legal reporting requirements and business functions that will need care and feeding. For now, I am taking care of those things but we may want to consider hiring an operations person to manage much of the day to day.\n\nDAO Updates:\nA new v3 of our governance process has been posted for commentary and we will ratify this as part of this vote. This ratification process will enable us to memorialize the adoption of a process we are largely already following. \n\nAsset Transfer Updates:\nGitcoin Holdings is aligned with our interest in taking formal legal ownership of the various assets mentioned above (e.g. our Treasury, smart contracts, trademarks, SaaS contracts we need to operate) we as a community have created/maintained or advanced or need to grow so that they can then focus on revenue and delivering the best hackathon experience possible for those partners who entrust them to grow their communities (for simplicity, I refer to these as our Assets). This means that Gitcoin Holdings will be transferring these Assets to us, as well as some additional capital to ensure the Foundation and subsidiaries can pay their operating costs for some time and run as an independent and decentralized enterprise (which also solves certain legal capitalization requirements).\n\nSince Hackathons is built on the Gitcoin brand, Gitcoin Holdings will be granted a temporary license to use Gitcoin trademarks until they reestablish operations under a new name, and I imagine we will continue to share a community for some time.",

      "title": "Gitcoin // Radicle Public Goods Alliance",
      "content": "Forum post: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-radicle-public-goods-alliance-temp-check/10825\n\n## Summary\n\nWe propose a Public Goods Alliance be formed between Gitcoin and Radicle. Gitcoin and Radicle will provide a mutual grant of their respective native tokens (GTC and RAD) to the partner DAO’s treasury. Voting power from these tokens will be delegated to multisigs controlled by the partner DAO. Gitcoin will receive a range of RAD (dependent upon the final grant rate) and Radicle will receive 500,000 GTC, making both DAOs top 10 delegates in one another’s governance [1]. \n\n### Context \n[Llama](https://llama.xyz) builds economic infrastructure for DAOs. We are an opinionated layer on top of DeFi protocols that helps DAOs take treasury actions including treasury diversification, liquidity provisioning, token swaps, and more. As part of our goal to grow the DAO economy, Llama has engaged with key stakeholders from the Gitcoin (Scott) and Radicle (Abbey) communities to propose a Public Goods Alliance. We presented our plan to Gitcoin’s Mutual Grants Committee and, after incorporating feedback from the committee, would now like to present the alliance to the broader Gitcoin community. You can view some of our work [here](https://llama.xyz/community). For more on Llama and our initiatives, see below. \n\n### Overview of Radicle \nRadicle is a decentralized code collaboration network built on open protocols, allowing developers to collaborate on code without trusting intermediaries. Radicle provides the benefits of a centralized code collaboration platform while retaining Git’s peer-to-peer nature.\n\n## Purpose \nAs web3-native DAOs, Gitcoin and Radicle share similar missions of growing the public goods ecosystem. The Gitcoin and Radicle communities have rallied around this public goods mission and informally worked together over the last few years, co-hosting events and integrating Radicle in Kernel. In the future, Gitcoin and Radicle can benefit from more product integrations and a closer relationship.  As the two operate in similar spaces and have complementary focuses, Llama believes a formal Public Goods Alliance between the two DAOs would be mutually beneficial.  We view this alliance as a unique opportunity to formalize the partnership that has developed over the last few years by gaining a governance stake in each other’s communities. The alliance will allow the communities to: \n* ***Collaborate on a shared vision through governance in each other’s communities***: The mutual grant makes Gitcoin and Radicle major governance stakeholders in one another’s communities. Each community will have influence in the other’s governance process, enabling them to best represent their interests and to more closely collaborate on a shared open-source vision. \n* ***Develop synergistic features and products***: A formal partnership and vested token interest creates opportunity for closer collaboration on features and products that will benefit both communities. This could provide the necessary support for joint development on things such as using Radicle’s decentralized identity for Gitcoin Grants and Gitcoin becoming a de facto funding mechanism for open source projects on Radicle. \n* ***Set precedent for future community alliances***: Both Gitcoin and Radicle’s treasury strategies outline the basis for mutual grants and community collaborations being influential to the success of the protocols. This alliance can serve as a basis and provide the template for future collaborations for Gitcoin, Radicle, and the larger web3 ecosystem. In the future, and with alliance-member approval, more DAOs could be brought into the alliance. \n* ***Diversify each DAO’s governance base***: Today, the distribution of voting power at both DAOs is concentrated in the hands of internal contributors. Both DAOs would benefit from a more diverse voter base, especially one that includes a like-minded partner DAO as one of its top stakeholders. To achieve this, Llama proposes that Gitcoin receive RAD (depending on final grant rate) and Radicle receive 500,000 GTC, formalizing the alliance between the two DAOs and making each DAO a top 10 delegate in each other’s governance. \n\nAfter the proposal is executed, both DAOs agree to hold the others’ tokens for a minimum of 2 years. \n\n## Proposed Voting Process \nTwo committees (one committee from each community) of 3 representatives will be chosen to focus on metagovernance in each community. 2 representatives will come from the respective community, while 1 representative will be from the Llama team. Community representatives should have a similar level of engagement as Gitcoin Stewards; they should have the context needed to make decisions on most proposals that Radicle is putting up for votes.  \n\nThe committees should vote independently, though the two should collaborate on joint governance proposals and initiatives relating to the strategic alliance. \n\nThe committee will be responsible for keeping track of all proposals in the other community and bringing them to their respective community for discussion. For each proposal, the committee will vote on behalf of their respective community, informed by their community’s values, the goals of the Public Goods Alliance, and feedback from the broader community.  \n\nVotes will be executed out of a multisig controlled by the Metagovernance Committee. Upon receiving the mutual grant, the Treasury will automatically delegate votes to the multisig. \n\n## Reporting & Criteria for Success \nIn order to allow the communities to evaluate the success of the alliance, it’s important to provide comprehensive, objective reporting on how the partnership is working. Reporting should be done on a monthly and quarterly basis to share results with both communities. Below are several ideas about how to gauge success of the alliance. \n* Governance  \n    * Participation rate in each other’s governance votes \n    * Number of proposals posted in each other’s forum by the committee  \n    * Number of comments posted in each other’s forum by the committee  \n    * The impact of cross-governance participation, with a particular focus on the major or contentious proposals \n* Social  \n    * Number of co-sponsored events and their attendance  \n    * Community sentiment regarding the partnership and overall governance involvement (e.g. community members’ willingness to hold the other protocol’s tokens, voting on the other community’s proposals) \n* Product  \n    * Number of development hours contributed to joint projects  \n    * Joint features / products / integrations shipped or in-flight \n\nThe quarterly review might include the above information and additionally report on: \n* Furthering Gitcoin and Radicle’s primary mission  \n    * Whether and how the partnership has helped Gitcoin build and fund public goods on web3  \n    * Whether and how the partnership has helped Radicle develop resilient, peer-to-peer collaboration software \n* Collab / interoperability  \n    * Cross-community interoperability and its growth trajectory  \n    * Other synergies, or the lack thereof  \n\n## Ragequit Options \nIn the event that one party wants to reverse the deal after the mutual grant has been executed, Gitcoin and Radicle will need to strike a new agreement and run it through the governance process. Considering the operational complexities, compromise of the future roadmap, and damage of capital and goodwill the other community may endure, the party that initiates the reversal should reasonably expect less lenient terms, such as a partial return of the originally granted assets. Each DAO may choose to leave the alliance and return tokens within one month of the proposal being executed. \n\n## Ideas for Extensions of the Alliance \nWe view this mutual grant as just the beginning of a long alliance between Gitcoin and Radicle. In the future, we would like to explore more options to further the alliance. Several ideas include: \n* Gitcoin and Radicle commit funding to a jointly-governed pool and use it to advance public goods (grant programs, product development, etc.) \n* Having new public-goods-centric DAOs join the alliance \n\n## Asks from the Community \n*We are looking for 2 community members to serve on the Metagovernance Committee. If you are interested, please reach out to Scott or Dan.* \n\n--- \n\n ##### *[1] Source: [Radicle delegates](https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0x690e775361AD66D1c4A25d89da9fCd639F5198eD), [Gitcoin delegates](https://www.tally.xyz/governance/eip155:1:0xDbD27635A534A3d3169Ef0498beB56Fb9c937489).* \n\n--- \n## About Llama \nLlama is building economic infrastructure for DAOs.

      "title": "[Proposal] Fund FDD Season 14 Budget Request",
      "content": "This is an AMENDED renewal proposal for the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream requesting budgetary funds for Season 14 (1 May 2022 through 31 July 2022). [Last amendment made Thursday, May 26th. Discussion period ends and proposal will be moved to snapshot on Tuesday, May 31st.\n\nFDD is looking for the community to decide on funding and at what level. This proposal is a request to fund Season 14 (S14) and replenish its reserves for S15 (60 days calculated as ⅔ the approved Season 14 budget. Amounts listed below on each option are the season 14 budget request without reserves).\n\n\nHOW VOTING WILL WORK\n\nSelect the option that you think FDD should be funded based on the initiatives below. A vote for option 1 would count towards each lower funding option until one is selected.\n\nFor example\n\noption 1 has 1 million votes (Not enough)\noption 2 has 1 million votes (Counted as 2 million votes including option 1 - still not enough)\noption 3 has 1.5 million votes (Counted as 3.5 million votes including 1 & 2 - This passes)\noption 4 has 2.5 million votes (Enough to pass on its own, but the higher level is passed)\n\n\nVOTING OPTIONS\n\nOPTION 1 - Fund FDD request $390,000 season 14 budget\n(40% reduction from original request)\n\nOPTION 2 - Fund FDD $330,000 and signal they should not perform a discovery 4 of a sybil detection / Passport DAO\n(49% reduction from original request)\n\nOPTION 3 - Fund FDD $200,000 to continue round operations but not support innovation or round to round improvements.\n(69% reduction from Season 13)\n\nOPTION 4 - Do Not Fund FDD\n(100% reduction from Season 13)\n\nOPTION 5 - Abstain\n\n\nTLDR\n\nWe have participated in governance and lowered our budget request to provide a lean FDD working to make grants 2.0 transition a success. The full funding request includes the original 40% reduction requested. We encourage stewards to fully fund FDD with option 1.\n\nOption 1 & 2 are fundamental differences on the timing or need to launch a sybil detection DAO that focuses on Passport adoption and utility. Ideally, GitcoinDAO would own 20-50% stake and have a 10% aqueduct commitment.\n\nOption 3 is a vote against the current team or roadmap for FDD. It is a signal that you do not believe funds are or will be used effectively, but know that GR14 requires some level of fraud detection & defense work.\n\nOption 4 is a vote against FDD existing.\n\n\nHigh Level Budget Breakdown\n\nSeason 14 Budget Total = $x*\n\nPLUS Season 15 Reserves = (x*1.6777)\n\nTotal Needed = $x + (x*1.6777)\n\nMINUS Current Reserves = TBD* (110k GTC or approximately $254k)\n\nTotal GTC Amount requested at this time = TBD*\n\n*The total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Tally. The vote will be to send $USD value in GTC at the current spot price when moved to Tally or the 20 day moving average (whichever is lower).",

Rather than simply request a budget with a slight reduction, we wanted to get feedback from the community on each outcome FDD plans to work on during Season 14. \n\nTHIS VOTE WILL BE USED TO HELP US CONSTRUCT A FINAL BUDGET REQUEST FOR SEASON 14. \n\nFDD has Outcomes which are nested under the following 3 priorities. \n\nSybil Defense (SD) - Protect the legitimacy of funding round outcomes\n\nGrants Intelligence Agency - Provide credible neutrality to grant eligibility moderation\n\nEvolution - Operate the workstream and improve our processes, knowledge and insights.\n\nHere is how the outcomes fit into a 2x3 grid showing operational vs innovation along with the future potential for each outcome. \n\n![FDD Budget • Gitcoin Holdings - Google Chrome 2022-05-12 at 2.06.01 PM.jpeg](ipfs://QmUCTjKfF1PRqrbuZVFdyjZshiP1S768QGCqPsnL4d6sAJ)\n\nHere is our current plan for how budget will be spread amongst the outcomes.

Note: The GTC total will be adjusted based on the current market value at the time this proposal is moved to Snapshot and to Tally.

      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal, if passed, would issue 50,000 GTC for governance rights equating to 1,500,000 $WONDER tokens (1.5% of total supply) when Wonder’s token is live. \n\nIn addition, upon launch, 1% of Wonder’s treasury will be used for QF rounds via Gitcoin Aqueduct 2, to fund projects that are on or will be started on Wonder.\n\nThe purpose of this alliance is to solidify the partnership between Gitcoin and Wonder where we can work together to enable DAOs to succeed.\n\nMotivation\n\nGitcoin and Wonder are pursuing aligned missions.\n\nGitcoin’s mission is to build & fund the open web; Wonder is building the necessary tools to facilitate thriving projects on the open web.\n\nWonder’s task management system allows DAOs to intuitively organize projects, pay contributors with their native token, and onboard new members with ease.\n\nGitcoin, a DAO of DAOs, benefits from partnership with projects that provide the infrastructure for a nascent DAO ecosystem. Specifically, Wonder can help Gitcoin-funded projects better onboard and retain contributors, improve productivity, and increase visibility within the DAO. In addition, we see this relationship complementing Gitcoin in the following ways:\n\n- Integrations that help Gitcoin source, fund, and scale more public good projects\n- Collaboration on job fairs, hackathons, and events for DAOs\n- Co-Creating tools to help the Gitcoin DAO operate more efficiently\n- Enabling Gitcoin to have a voice in the future direction of Wonder\n- Overall, this partnership between Gitcoin and Wonder would likely mark the first of many collaborations with projects in the ‘DAO tooling’ space.\n\nSpecification\n\nThe passing of this proposal would transfer 50,000 GTC to 0x231F77F0c4D7a9F2E20767c7B76ae745A6c547f9, Wonder’s specified Treasury address.\n\nOn the launch of Wonder’s token, 1,500,000 $WONDER would be transferred to 0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6, Gitcoin’s multisig address.\n\nIn addition, upon launch, 1% of Wonder’s treasury will be used for QF rounds via Gitcoin Aqueduct 2, to fund projects that are on or will be started on Wonder.\n\nUse of Funds\n\nTo ensure long term alignment, Wonder will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2024 and act as a meta-delegate in the Gitcoin ecosystem.\n\nTo ensure long term alignment, Gitcoin will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2024 and act as a meta-delegate in the Wonder ecosystem.\n\n1% of Wonder’s treasury will be used for QF rounds via Gitcoin Aqueduct 2, to fund projects that are on or will be started on Wonder.\n\nBenefits\n\n- A long term collaboration between Gitcoin and Wonder\n- Integrations of Gitcoin on Wonder’s platform\n- 1,500,000 $WONDER tokens\n- 1% of $WONDER treasury would flow back into QF PGF mechanisms\n\nDrawbacks\n\n- 50,000 GTC would be removed from the treasury.\n\nPrior Discussion & Forum Vote\n\nPlease see prior discussion and our forum vote here:\nhttps://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-partnership-mutual-grant-with-wonder/10170\n\nVote\n\nVote `For` to support the partnership & mutual grant. Vote `Against` to deny the partnership & mutual grant. A majority `For` vote passes the proposal.\n",

As part of those term negotiations, we will also review and ratify the governing bylaws for the foundation to ensure token holders have near total control of actions taken by the foundation.\n\nAn initial draft set of bylaws can be found here, which will be updated as negotiations ensue:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1zeSg6piVFNCsYuCSMlwUtiEgnMvHqNsi9oPO6zhlqdU/edit\n\nCall to action:\nThis vote is to signal we would like to adopt The Gitcoin Foundation and have me represent the community in these negotiations.

      "content": "\nThis proposal seeks to elect the members of the GD Steward Council, approve its mandate and tenure. We currently have 14 stewards elligible for a seat on the council. \n\nA separate snapshot will go up for Council GTC allocation. \n\n*Formation*\nThe current lineup of stewards with scores 8/10 and over is as follows:\n\n@DisruptionJoe\n@Pop\n@krrisis\n@seedphrase\n@bobjiang\n@tjayrush\n@Sirlupinwatson\n@HelloShreyas\n@lefterisjp\n@linda\n@griff \n@Fishbiscuit\n@kyle\n@austingriffith\n\n*Mandate & Term*\nThe first Stewards Council will be active from the time the proposal passes for a period of 180 days, in line with the seasons cadence established as part of the proposal. One council would cover 2 seasons and there would be 2 councils/year.\n\nNOTE*: the first council will have a slightly  shorter term covering S13 & S14. A decision can be made to extend term should adjustment period need to be longer.\n\nThe 180 day cadence matches the quarterly cadence of the Gitcoin DAO calendar and offers a great opportunity to reflect, expand and amplify the mission of GD. Cadence as follows:\n\nSeason 13 - 2.1 to 4.30 (GR13 | 3.9-3.24)\nSeason 14 - 5.1 to 7.30 (GR14 | 6.8-6.23)\nSeason 15 - 8.1 to 10.30 (GR15 | 9.7-9.22)\nSeason 16 - 11.1 to 1.31 (GR16 | 11.30-12.15)\nand ongoing - any changes for holidays or other interruptions would be voted on\n\nA milestone report will be presented at the end of the 180 day mark, ensuring the model is deemed valuable by the community and any essential and valuable learnings are incorporated in the model.\n\n*Steward council mandate:*\n\n- Keeping a ‘docket’ of ongoing proposals / their current status\n- Ensure proposals follow template(s) 1 / creating any necessary adjustments to template(s)\n- Perform an in-depth analysis of budget requests by workstreams. This includes:\n-workstream performance and delivery(from the milestone reports included in the proposals)\n-funds left over from previous seasons and taking them into account for the season\n-list of contributors to workstream\n-value of ask\n\n- Consult on workstream performance/workstream leads’ milestone progress - address and act to solve any workstream issues that may occur within a season\n-Participate in active discussion around proposals, timely voting\n-Availability for Tally proposal creation and ratification once a proposal has passed Snapshot\n\nParticipation in a council call that will be scheduled halfway between the monthly steward call (aka every two weeks) for better alignment & broader DAO strategy discussion.\n\nThis mandate will evolve to take into account any learnings from the first council activity as we evolve the structure and the model based on optimum balance.\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "GR13 Matching Pool Allocations",
      "content": "This Snapshot vote is looking to finalize a decision around the Gitcoin Grants Round 13 allocations proposed and discussed in this forum post (https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-gr13-matching-pool-allocations/9915).\n\nAbstract\n\nPrior to Grants Round 12, the pool was governed by categories that assigned specific percentages of the pool to grants in specific disciplines or geographies.\n\nIn Grants Round 12, the community voted to run an experiment proposed by the Public Goods Funding workstream to test Vitalik’s theory that Quadratic Funding should be as effective at allocating funds as allocation via categories. By doing away with specific grant categories and having all grants listed together, we took a step towards simplifying and decentralizing matching. \n\nOn the whole, the Public Goods Funding workstream believes the experiment was a success – directionally, at the very least. We believe the experiment was helpful in getting funding to more grants without complaints from top earners, and allowed us to test our assumptions about removing categories.\n\nA statement from the PGF workstream:\n\nWe don’t know for sure yet if the main pool approach works best long-term, but we do know that there were major benefits for a longer tail of grantees and that it exceeded our expectations despite bugs, and we think it’s worth trying again before we drastically change course.\nVote\n\nVoting\n\nThe forum post outlined three options – to continue with the cap at 2.5%, to continue with the cap at a different percentage (as proposed by the community), or a completely new community-led proposal, should anyone want to put a new structure forth. \nDuring the period the forum post was up, we did not receive any specific proposals for different percentages or structures to try in GR13.\n\nAs a result, we are structuring the vote as follows:\n\nFOR: Repeat main pool with 2.5% cap\n\nStick to exactly what we did in GR12.\n\nNo individual grant’s matching contribution amount shall exceed 2.5% of the overall matching pool fund (i.e., $30K of the $1.2M pool).\n\n\nAGAINST: Alternate proposal\n\nSelect this option if you have an alternate proposal you would like to table. Please post that proposal and all its associated details in the forum as soon as you vote.",

One question that came up multiple times was “If you had to slash $x from your budget, do you know what you would cut?” The answer is yes. However, it wouldn’t be to the benefit of Gitcoin. We could operationally function at half this budget for GR13, but we wouldn’t be doing anything to build scalability into our tech or our processes.",

      "content": "Summary:\n\nIf this proposal passes, we plan to distribute 32,717.33 GTC using WhalerDAO’s Astro-Drop tool to the users below who were eligible for the GTC Airdrop in May 2021, tried to claim their GTC during the airdrop window, but were not able to claim due to an error in the system ingesting their transactions.\n\nAbstract:\n\nThe GTC airdrop earlier this year was a great step towards the decentralization of the Gitcoin ecosystem. Unfortunately, there are several users who were eligible for the drop because they funded the project Force DAO before the cut-off date for the airdrop. However, due to an error in the transaction validator these users were unable to claim their tokens. Specifically, when these users went to claim their tokens within the 30-day airdrop window, they were not allocated a percent of GTC tokens for their donations to Force DAO. After speaking with users and investigating online, it seems that those transactions were incorrectly dropped before the airdrop period. After some of these users reported it, they eventually had their transactions re-added, but after the cut-off date. This proposal is looking to retroactively compensate those users who were not able to claim their GTC due to the error. \n\nWe will compensate the users linked below. All these users have demonstrated the necessary proof to be eligible for the airdrop and were responsive throughout the proposal process. We had two criteria in order to show eligible proof:\n\n1) Proof of original donation which meets the original airdrop requirements\n2) Proof of an attempted claim during the original airdrop period\n\nIf passed, we wish to distribute the specified amount (view linked pdf for exact amounts) through WhalerDAO’s Astro-Drop. The total amount of GTC to be distributed to these users is 32,717.33\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\n- List of users: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p5botoxZ4vd5XpVbZzusyiqxZGfB8SaU/view?usp=drivesdk\n\n- Budget breakdown:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1LjNKqpz3iWM5qtXoD58W37ZtDq1ZnETj/view?usp=drivesdk\n\n- Read the full proposal: \nhttps://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-redistribute-gtc-to-individuals-who-could-not-claim-due-to-error/8782\n\n- Distribution tool: \nhttps://whalerdao.github.io/astrodrop/create",

It is built on top of a modularised open-source framework of smart contracts with various interfaces that can easily be extended and adapted to any use case. The first supported interaction will be token swaps, followed by joint ventures, co-liquidity pooling, and co-farming that are facilitated by PrimeDAO’s agnostic, trustless, and flexible D2D contracts.\n\nProposal Inverter: A new funding receiver primitive that will allow DAOs to pool resources and co-fund open research/crowdfunded initiatives through semi-automated payment flows.\n\nPrime Rating: A permissionless framework for quantifying DeFi protocol risk and quality and a research hub for DAO enthusiasts.\n\nPrime Pools: An interface that facilitates the creation and management of DAO-governed liquidity pools which can enable the bridging of liquidity between allied ecosystems and creation of index pools.\n\nWe see this relationship complementing Gitcoin in the following ways:\n\n- Enabling Gitcoin to have a direct stake in the future direction of PrimeDAO via 0.5% allocation of their governance token into the Gitcoin Treasury\n- Strengthening ties between and improving the shared bandwidth of Gitcoin and Prime teams\n- Collaborating on building DAO 2 DAO tooling to usher in the next era of coordination\n\nSpecification\n\nThe passing of this proposal would transfer $250,000 USD worth of $GTC to 0x567d220B0169836cBF351DF70A9c517096ec9De7, PrimeDAO’s specified Treasury address.\n\n500K $D2D, a 0.5% allocation, would be transferred to 0xde21F729137C5Af1b01d73aF1dC21eFfa2B8a0d6, Gitcoin’s multisig address for easier delegation / voting.\n\nUse of Funds\n\nTo ensure long-term alignment, Prime DAO will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the Gitcoin ecosystem.\n\nTo ensure long-term alignment, Gitcoin will hold no less than 50% of the tokens received through 2023 and act as a meta-delegate in the Prime DAO ecosystem.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nRead the full proposal details and the discussion here: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-partnership-mutual-grant-with-prime-dao/9330",

      "title": "GR12 Matching Pool Allocations",
      "content": "This Snapshot vote is looking to finalize a decision around the Gitcoin Grants Round 12 allocations proposed and discussed [in this forum post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-gr12-matching-pool-allocations/9007/24).\n\nAbstract\n\nGitcoin has historically utilized categories, based on Grant types, to determine matching pool allocations based on a percentage of the overall matching pool fund during Grant Rounds. During the GR11 Finale Event this overall strategy was questioned by Vitalik Buterin, the argument being Quadratic Funding should be just as effective during Grant Rounds using no categories.\n\nDuring GR12, the Public Goods Funding workstream wants to test Vitalik’s theory that Quadratic Funding should be as effective at allocating funds as allocation via categories. By doing away with specific grant categories and having all grants listed together, we hope to simplify and decentralize matching. This is a radical change in how we’ve historically set matching funds for grants’ matching pools, but a challenge we believe will help to better understand how to best implement Quadratic Funding.\n\n\n[The forum post](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-gitcoin-gr12-matching-pool-allocations/9007/24) outlines the above in more detail –- and this Snapshot vote will decide if and how we test this approach in GR12.\n\nVote\n\nThe three options to vote on are:\n\nOption 1: Single Pool Experiment\n\nUse GR12 as a test case to run an experiment whereby we do away with categories.\n\nThe GR12 main pool will be a single matching pool fund/distribution of $1,000,000 in matching for the round. No individual grant’s matching contribution amount shall exceed 2.5% of the overall matching pool fund (i.e., $25k)\n\nPros: We get to run a proper experiment and try out a new approach to funding\n\nCons: The experiment is an unknown vs. our tried & trusted categories\n\n\nOption 2: No experiment\n\nStick with the same category-based approach we’ve been using in the past – specifically, run GR12 with the same categories as GR11.\n\nPros: Less uncertainty (rinse & repeat prior round approach)\nCons: We remain in the dark as to how a Single Pool might perform\n\n \nOption 3: Do a 50/50\n\nRun 50% of the matching pot as a single pool experiment, and 50% category-based as before.\n\nThis option was proposed in response to the governance proposal that outlined Option 1. This was proposed as a ‘happy medium’ – going more gradually vs. doing a full-on experiment in GR12.\n\nPros: We get to experiment a bit while maintaining the category approach for half the pool\nCons: Having both at once is more complex and potentially very confusing for grantees",

We have kicked off a Grant Round for the Moonshot Collective team which contained 11 grants. Since the start of the round we have had 3 new grant submissions which have gone through the approval process and you can see on the platform at https://grants.gtcdao.net/\n\n### Out of the 41,300 GTC received for Q3, we have 10k GTC and 40k DAI remaining which we are moving forward to our Q4 budget.\n\n### Q4 Goals High Level\nDuring Q4 the Decentralize Gitcoin workstream will (and has already started to) continue to collect feedback and improve the user interface and user experience, build additional features based on what is most important to run the round in GR12 and for claiming payouts, start working on implementing active sybil resistance and basic curation, and kick off the DID/Sybil Score Aggregation project and DevOps/Data initiative.\n\nReference previous budget [here](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/decentralize-gitcoin-workstream-budget-request/8121).\n\nFor detailed budget proposal and breakdown see [this post on the governance forum](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-decentralize-gitcoin-workstream-budget-request-q4-2021/8895).\n\nGnosis Safe address: 0x931896A8A9313F622a2AFCA76d1471B97955e551",

This will disincentivize fraud and is the recommendation of Gitcoin Holdings, FDD Workstream, and Blockscience.\n\n2. Ratify the round results and DO pay the fraud tax\n\nPay all grants the max of what they would get in either case (Sybil flags or no Sybil flags).\n\nYou ratify the results as reported by Gitcoin Holdings & the Fraud Detection & Defense workstream and request the keyholders of the community multisig to continue paying the fraud tax as was done during GR9 & GR10.\n\n3.

This proposal issues them a grant, which solves for the near term the funding of CLR.Fund.\n\nSecondarily, this proposal if passed would\n\n- Extend [previous friendly contact](https://twitter.com/nanexcool/status/1383481998417678342) between Kevin Owocki and Auryn MacMillian to formally affirm that Gitcoin & CLRFund are friendly projects built around similar missions.\n- Change the narrative created by other competitive projects working on the same domain. That is the misguided belief that we must have sharp elbows - boxing each other out from each other’s users and demonstrate loud social media clap-backs.\n- It is possible that the goodwill between the two projects could be extended into a formal integration or partnership one day - especially with the [Decentralize Gitcoin workstream](https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/workstream-suggestion-decentralize-gitcoin/180) gaining speed.\n- By pushing new tech and solutions on top of QF (such as MACI), CLR.Fund can act as a testbed/testnet for future gitcoin features and visa-versa.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nThis proposal met the minimum number of days for deliberation having been posted on August 15.\n\nRead the full proposal details and the discussion here: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/proposal-issue-clr-fund-a-40k-gtc-grant/8240",

Especially science and software libraries public goods suffer severe underfunding when funding quadratic, because every funder cannot know every science topic.\n\n* When doing quadratic funding it inevitably goes much random - some projects are funded too much and some are severely underfunded (among other reasons, because well-funded projects can buy SEO of their ads).\n\n* Anti-sybil is improving but it can’t be perfect.\n\n* If some important text or software is buried on the 100000th position of Google, the world gets stuck: nobody knows that the missing component is a problem and therefore nobody fixes the problem.\n\nSo, we need a much more objective mean of funding. Ideally funding amount should be calculated by an algorithm, not by stupid us.\n\nWe don’t yet have an algorithm capable to predict the future of the human work. The solution is to use a prediction market to predict a future algorithm results. So the market decides.\n\nTraders (when motivated by money) are much more careful, hard working, and through than some random quadratic voter. Traders are therefore multitudinous that much reduces randomness and bias. They are to follow an objective algorithm that motivates them and so the market is striving for objective results.\n\nSo, I provide a software that “forces” traders to “calculate” how much which project to fund.\n\nThere will appear a new profession: people that search for underrepresented public good projects and do SEO for them. That’s important.\n\nIt should be in addition to quadratic Grants. Users should have choice where to pay.\n\nThis software is almost fully implemented (and there is a little outdated pull request to integrate it into a GitCoin page).\n\nThe proposal:\n\n* Pay for quality audit of the smart contracts.\n* Assign me to finish integrating it into GitCoin site.\n* Do a good design.\n* Deploy on production.\n\nHere is the PR and more details:\n* https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/issues/8183\n* https://github.com/gitcoinco/web/pull/8265",

I am also a developer myself, if necessary, I am willing to participate in it!\n2. the official website to increase the multilingual version, the official multiple product pages, including many learning materials and documents can support multilingual, convenient for friends in different regions to participate and learn.\n\nThe above is my first proposal as a newcomer, welcome to correct any deficiencies (English is automatically translated from Deepl. (Cry with laughter)\n\nFor the multilingual proposal, especially important is the Chinese users, which is a very large team, never lack of excellent developers, investors, evangelists, and a large number of high-quality Internet groups willing to actively participate in governance.\n\n\n\n中文原文：\n\n各位社区的朋友们好，我是gitcoin的新朋友，这个社区所构想的未来特别迷人，对我来说这是个自由的新大陆。\n同样，一定有许多世界各地的新朋友和我一样也加入了进来，我觉得社区可以考虑支持多语言了，让更多地区的朋友加入进来，让社区更加的DAO。\n\n支持多语言的建议：\n1. 官方论坛增加多语言的入口，不同地区的朋友选择进入各自语言目录参与讨论，类似目录功能。我本身也是一名开发者，如果有需要，我非常愿意参与进来\n2. 官方网站增加多语言的版本，官方的多个产品页，包括许多的学习资料和文档可以支持多语言，方便不同地区的朋友参与和学习。\n\n以上就是作为新手的我，第一次提案，有不足的地方欢迎指正（英文从Deepl自动翻译而来 (笑哭)）\n\n对于多语言的提案中，尤其重要的是中文用户，这是一个非常庞大的队伍，从来不缺乏优秀的开发者、投资者、布道者，还有大量愿意积极参与治理的高质量互联网群体。",

      "title": "Implement Akita sale/stream as a Balancer pool",
      "content": "This proposal came too late to be one of the options in the [Akita, a path forward](https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/QmUoBpLsMSZ7Aq1UEzvEyGyTdR8Reeb8qQFGUhcQLqcQMM) poll, which at the moment is leading with \"Sell 10%, stream 90%\" and \"Liquidate 100%\" so I will propose it as a further discussion on the merits of how to implement it. This was posted on June 1st as a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/avsa/status/1399892313007083522?s=21) and gathered some positive feedback from many of the community representatives.\n\n## The issue with the two main proposals\n\n* There's not enough market depth to liquidate all Akita tokens without losing a lot of value for Gitcoin. Even if there are serious doubts about the long term viability of the Akita community, we have a responsibility to maximize the value gained for Gitcoin. \n* Locking Akita on Sablier doesn't put that capital to good use, and if the market crashes and recovers and crashes again during before the stream is over, then there was a missed opportunity.\n\n\n## The Proposed Implementation\n\n1) Sell 10% of Akita in any exchange, put it in the Gitcoin treasury\n2) Sell yet another 10% into ETH. \n3) Create a Scheduled Balancer pool with the 10% ETH obtained in step 2 and all the remaining Akita.\n4) Set up the pool controller to programmatically change the ratio over a period P so that it inverts from a 10% ETH 90% AKITA into a 90% ETH and 10% AKITA\n5) After period is over, the community can decide what to do with the remaining tokens. \n\nThose types of pools are usually called **Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools** and are often used to launch new tokens that don't have liquidity. In this case, the token has launched but it would still bootstrap the liquidity. You can read more about LBPs on this article about [Radicle](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/radicles-new-record-lbp-sale-shows-that-lbps-are-here-to-stay-4c81e15a4d4d).\n\nTo make sure the market doesn't dump immediately, we could do step 1 and 2 using [Gnosis Auctions](https://blog.gnosis.pm/announcing-gnosis-auction-launch-390124d56248): this would take off some buy pressure immediately and then make sure the starting price of the LBP is closer to what other market makers have.\n\n\n## The end result is that:\n* At the end of the period, Gitcoin will have sold most of their Akita, at a fairer market price, similarly to a Dollar Cost Averaging strategy\n* Akita community gets a much more liquid market, a \"billion\" dollars deep (emphasis on the air quotes). This will reduce the impact any single seller can have on the final price.\n* All trades that are executed against this pool will earn fees for Gitcoin, so in periods of high volatility Gitcoin is leveraging its massive Akita Holdings to generate Yield\n* There will be a constant sell pressure on Akita, but it's one that is scheduled and known\n\n\n## Variants and Risks\n\nBalancer Pools are quite flexible and we could do other options like having a pool that starts at 91% Akita, 3% GTC, 3% ETH and 3% DAI. Or we could add all the dog tokens into a big billion dollar pile of dog ~~poo~~ money.\n\nPools also don't necessarily need to be locked: we can add a smart controller so that Gitcoin DAO can accelerate the schedule at a later vote, or simply change it completely and use the [Pie DAO](https://medium.com/piedao/introducing-pie-smart-pools-85a77a2dc22e) so that ratios can be changed at the will of GTC holders. Also, at any point, Gitcoin could vote to take the liquidity out of its own pool and receive it in either token of the pool.\n\nIt's also important to note that **LBPs are different than just selling a token**: the pool wants to keep a constant ratio at all times to reach its target, be it 10%, 25% or 90%. So it means that *the pool will both sell and buy akita for ETH* to keep the target ratio–that's how AMMs work. A LBP changes that target ratio slowly over time, but it also is reacting to the market in real time. It means that, if akita drops to near 0, then the pool will automatically be buying akita with ETH until it reaches the desired balance, so almost ETH would be drained from the pool. But that ETH came from the Akita sale in the step 2, and the end result would be the same if the strategy was to stream or liquidate it anyway. On the other hand, if the market goes up again, that will mean the pool will start selling the cheap akita it bought back to ETH (plus the fees it got during the period) which is why pools make money from volatility. \n\nDisclaimer: I work for Balancer labs, but if the community wants to they can use other solutions. Balancer also has a \"LBP referral program\" but I am perfectly willing to either not claim it or to donate the BAL gained to Gitcoin.\n\n## Period P\n\nThis proposal leaves the P period open.

This allows for greater flexibility for using some of the LP assets to fund grants matching rounds. On the other hand, this flexibility could make users nervous about holding $SACKS for fear of losing liquidity.\n\nI'd like to propose transferring the LP position to the [Gitcoin governance timelock](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde21f729137c5af1b01d73af1dc21effa2b8a0d6#tokentxnsErc721). This creates an ~11 day delay between submitting a proposal to remove liquidity and actually having it removed (2 day proposal delay period, 7 day voting period, and 2 day timelock). Greater confidence will hopefully lead to greater long term funding impact from the SACKS position.",

      "title": "Impose Governance Standards & Processes",
      "content": "# Background:\nThere are currently three votes around what to do with the AKITA held by the Gitcoin Multisig. Each one, seemingly, have somewhat contradictory mandates. This is because there have not been standards and processes put in place as of yet that establish \"what occurs in scenario X if Y\", i.e. \"what occurs when two contradictory votes pass, prior to execution of the first?\" (double jeopardy, to some extent).\n\n# Proposal\nThis proposal is rather meta. It is a proposal to begin a set of proposals to set standards and processes that proposers must follow to ensure validity and enforce-ability. We should set rules for issues such as:\n- Double Jeopardy\n- Proposal Parameter Validity (start time, end time, start block, etc)\n- Proposal Process Validity (template, forum -> snapshot -> onchain?)\n- etc.\n\n# Prior Art\nYam was the first to establish a number of rules that we can look at for how to potentially impose standards for off-chain voting. Many protocols have followed since (some better than others). Yam established rules for what is considered a valid off-chain vote, specifying:\n1. Start date: must always be in the future, and have some amount of time (t+6hrs) from creation of the vote\n2. End date: must run for x amount of time\n3. Start block: must be within x minutes of vote start time\n\nAny vote that does not meet said criteria would be considered invalid and potentially censored from snapshot by controllers of the associated ENS. What I like about the above benchmarks for standards is that in general, most spammers won't follow the above and can be weeded out quickly and easily as well as ensuring fairness/time to prepare for votes, killing two birds with one stone.\n",
