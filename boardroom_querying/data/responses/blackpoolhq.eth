This ensures that the DAO maintains oversight over the services provided by the Association, aligning with the DAO’s interests and governance protocols.\n\nContext\nThe Association has been recently established in accordance with the laws of Switzerland and shall be a key partner in the Blackpool DAO ecosystem. In line with its statutory purpose and following the approval of this Proposal, the Association shall provide the Services (as detailed below) to the DAO to assist the DAO in its continued growth and in achieving its goals.\n\nFor the provision of the Services, the Association shall receive grants from the DAO. The amount of each grant shall be set out in a grant agreement on an arm’s length basis. Each grant will require specified milestones or other detailed specifications to be listed.\n\nThe Association is free to decide upon the way to carry out the execution or fulfilment of the milestone(s) or the specific purpose set out in the respective grant agreement. The Association is free to (i) perform and execute the necessary steps itself or (ii) engage suitable third parties as auxiliary persons.\n\nIn addition, in line with its statutory purpose, the Association shall become the sole owner of any intellectual property rights in and to any kind of work products that have been created or will be created relevant to and in the context of the Blackpool DAO ecosystem (“Rights”). Following the approval of this Proposal, to the extent that (within such Rights), the DAO owns any intellectual property rights (both now and in the future, including such rights in and to work products that have been created under freelancer, service or other agreements and those that will be created in the context of grants as set forth below), the DAO shall assign and transfer all such rights to the Association. In case the DAO should decide to no longer give grants to the Association and not to consider the Association as a partner in the Blackpool DAO ecosystem, all Rights (including those rights transferred to the Association by the DAO according to this provision, regardless of who or what entity assigned or transferred such rights to the Association) shall be transferred by the Association to the entity designated by the DAO through a governance decision.\n\nRationale\nThe DAO is being consulted on the list of services to be rendered by the Association to the DAO. Below is a brief (non-exhaustive) description of potential services to be provided:\n\nServices\tDescriptions\nAssistance in Operation and Maintenance\t* Ensuring the continuity of the DAO’s operations\nGovernance support|\n|Use and Management of Grants|* Using the grants received from the DAO in line with the milestones defined in the respective grant agreement;\nAssisting the DAO in administering the grants to be distributed from and to be received by the DAO, i.e., to perform KYC checks, to ensure compliance with grant terms, etc.|\n|Research & Development|Development of new products\nImprovement of existing products\n\nAudit management\n\nRisk management|\n|Legal Support|-\n\nLegal representation (entering into contractual agreements on behalf of the DAO, etc.)\nRegulatory monitoring\nLegal consulting\nIntellectual Property management (****holding and managing intellectual property rights)|\n|Workforce Management|Assisting in contracting processes (if needed)|\nThe DAO may propose any other service currently missing on the above list and that is deemed to be essential for the further development of the DAO and the Blackpool DAO ecosystem.\n\nGrant Conditions\nThe Association shall use the grants received from the DAO in good faith solely for and in connection with the Blackpool DAO project and the Blackpool DAO ecosystem. Any other use without the prior consent of the DAO is prohibited. Unused funds may, at the sole discretion of the DAO and subject to acceptance by the DAO, be rolled over to another subsequent grant agreement and be spent in accordance with the new milestones or purpose set forth therein. If any part of a grant cannot be used in accordance with the Blackpool DAO project or ecosystem and according to the milestones set out in the relevant grant agreement, it shall be returned to the DAO.\n\nThe grants paid by the DAO to the Association include any Value Added Tax (“VAT”) (if applicable).\n\nThe grants may be used for the payment of income tax, capital tax, VAT and tax at source or withholding tax, and any other taxes of the Association if such taxes apply and are related to the grant or the activities mentioned above.\n\nThe Association commits to produce half-yearly reports on the spending of the grants. It will list expenses in a summarized form and inform about the ongoing initiatives for which the funds are used. The report will be published in written form on the DAO’s governance forum.\n\nThe Association shall inform the DAO of any event or change in circumstances that could reasonably affect its ability to perform any of the grant conditions listed herein.\n\nThe Association does not guarantee any success related to its activities under the grant agreements to be concluded and all liabilities except for gross negligence, wilful intent and fraud are excluded.\n\nThis Governance Proposal and all the subsequent grant agreements shall, in all respects, be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of Switzerland (to the exclusion of the Vienna Convention on the Contracts of the Sale of Goods).

      "title": "BPIP#1 Enhanced veBPT Rewards & Incentives Framework",
      "content": "Summary\nThis proposal introduces a forward-thinking approach for BlackPool DAO, designed to enhance our adaptability to the dynamic regulatory environment. It explores new reward mechanisms for veBPT holders, potentially expanding beyond ETH rewards, and investigates innovative uses for the $BPT token. These initiatives are part of our ongoing commitment to staying at the forefront of industry best practices.\n\nDetails\nAs part of our ongoing commitment to align with the dynamic regulatory environment, BlackPool has invariably been engaging with legal experts to oversee the activities… Informed by this guidance, we are proactively adapting our approach. This includes pausing ETH rewards as we explore alternative methods to reward our community. This step ensures our reward system remains innovative and compliant while avoiding potential misinterpretation.\n\n—-\n\nBlackPool is proposing an evolved framework for the $BPT token. The vision strengthens the utility and community aspects of the governance token, offering a diverse array of perks and benefits as alternatives to ETH rewards. This is part of an ongoing dialogue within our community, and the specifics of these expanded functionalities will be shaped and detailed in forthcoming proposals. Below is an initial outline of what these enhancements will encompass:\n\n- Voting: $BPT (through veBPT) still enables holders to vote on protocol changes, treasury spending, and community-related matters, with added incentives for active participation being currently developed. BlackPool’s activities are designed to encourage collaborations, asset lending and community participation through governance.\n\n- Enhanced features: $BPT (through veBPT) offers a range of exclusive benefits and accessibilities to its governance participants. These perks can include early access to new features, eligibility for whitelists, access to unique content, or exclusive experiences that go beyond typical market offerings. The array of features provided by $BPT is designed to enhance user engagement and provide value in innovative and exciting ways, here are some potential examples :\n\n  - Integrated gaming experiences with exclusive achievements and rewards\n  - Preferential access and potential discounts on private token sales\n  - Alpha and early access to new projects and ventures\n  - Interactive AMAs, alpha channels, workshops with industry leaders and founders\n  - Exclusive access to VIP IRL events and meetings founders and KOLs\n  - Exclusive purchases or unlock money-can’t-buy assets and experience through veBPT access\n  - Personalised assets, exclusive airdrops, and private communication channels\n  - Pro players can use the $BPT governance or get support from the DAO to get a BlackPool sponsorship, i.e. access to high-value assets for competitive gaming (replicating Sorare or Big Time models)\n  - Rent gaming assets at a discount (even free) to play with BlackPool’s banner and chase rewards. (Be part of a team and rise to the ranks, pay NFT rental fees in $BPT for a massive discount, etc.)\n   - etc.\n\nThe new model will include future proposals for new distribution systems aimed at creating $ETH rewards with a structure that aligns with international regulatory standards, such as:\n\n- Governance Incentives: Active Governance participation will be rewarded, specifically promoting veBPT locking and active governance participation.\n- Liquid Locker Incentives: Liquidity providers for the sdBPT/BPT pair can be incentivised through bribes via the Vote Market mechanism of StakeDAO. BlackPool will offer bribes with $ETH, leading to sdBPT/BPT liquidity providers receiving $CRV with a boost. Note: BlackPool will keep using sdBPT for perk access, however, sdBPT will be able to vote only through Stake DAO's protocol.\n- Liquidity Mining: An initiative to increase the liquidity of $BPT is underway to ensure fluid token swapping, facilitating a more dynamic market.\nOur goal is steadfast: to continuously enhance the rewards for our community, especially for our long-term token holders engaged with the veBPT model. To achieve this, we are actively developing BlackPool V3.\n\nThis forthcoming version is being thoughtfully designed to align with regulatory standards, fully ensuring we adhere to the highest industry norms.\n\nAt the same time, we remain committed to preserving the core principles of decentralisation and robust governance. Through BlackPool V3, we are dedicated to delivering substantial and ongoing value to our community, demonstrating our ongoing commitment to their interests and our platform’s evolving ecosystem.",

      "title": "BPIR #1 : Whitelist Stake DAO to lock BPT on BlackPool",
      "content": "References/useful links for Stake DAO\nWebsite: https://stakedao.org/\nDocumentation: https://stakedao.gitbook.io/stakedaohq\nMedium: https://stakedaohq.medium.com/\nGithub Page: https://github.com/StakeDAO\nCommunities:\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/StakeDAOHQ\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/bnwTmsgX\n- Telegram: https://t.me/StakedaoHQ\n\nSummary:\nThis proposal aims to whitelist Stake DAO to allow the protocol to lock its acquired BPT tokens for veBPT and create the sdBPT liquid locker.\n\nRationale:\nThe Stake DAO and BlackPool contributors and communities have been actively supporting one another through business development, marketing, and events for the past few weeks and months. The link between the two projects is very strong, and the communities and the contributors are very united.\nThis proposal intends to strengthen even more the relationships between the two projects and to request the whitelisting of Stake DAO to lock BlackPool tokens (BPT).\n\nMotivation:\nStake DAO is a non-custodial platform built on top of decentralised protocols that enables anyone to easily grow their crypto portfolio, which recently released a new feature called the Liquid Lockers that will help accelerate the lock of tokens with a ve model.\nIt’s a new feature built for tokens with ve model allowing users to keep a liquid position while enjoying yield and the associated voting power (which can both be boosted with veSDT).\nThe liquid locker will allow users to lock BPT and receive sdBPT, which can be staked in the reward contract. sdBPT holders will be able to earn: native yield, a vote on proposals and gauges, boosted positions, voting power, while keeping a liquid position.\nThe locker will require a gauge for the sdBPT/BPT pool on Curve, to ensure the liquidity of the token. Furthermore, as other protocols have done it, BlackPool could help seed the sdBPT/BPT liquidity pool to ensure liquidity for sdBPT.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreictfmcdqoo7zrevpu5dw6nsrolmdgurdbrxiu5q3nab5n6tte4ghm)\n  \n",

      "content": "**Forum post:** https://gov.blackpool.finance/t/bpip-0-new-governance-framework/181/1\n\n**Summary:** This post aims to define a framework for BlackPool governance, by defining several types of proposals depending on the subject discussed,voting on DAO rules, and creating templates that should be helpful for everyone trying to participate.\n\nPrior to any vote, a proposal should be discussed on the governance forum and on Discord first to get a sentiment check and some valuable feedback about the community ideas.\n\n**Rationale:**\n**I) Information required for every type of proposal:**\n**Governance forum post:** Each proposal should be posted on the Governance forum for at least 48 hours before posting the snapshot, which allows the community to give some feedback, propose changes, and vote on a community sentiment poll.\n\n**Proposal type, number and name:** Each proposal must be easily identifiable and correctly classified.\n**Name:** The name must be the same on the forum post and snapshot (Max 10 words)\n**Number:** Each proposal must have a number that represents the post order on the forum and on snapshot\n**Type and description:** BPIR - BPGP - BPIP. This will be detailed in the second part of the proposal\n\n**Summary:** Short description of the proposal (1-2 sentences max)\n\n**Rationale:** Detailed explanation of the proposal and milestones for its execution.\n\n**Means:** Resources needed for this proposal\n- Human resources: Special skills required if any (dev or others)\n- Treasury resources: Proposal cost (in BPT/stables), % of the treasury required\n\n**Technical implementation:** Highlight the technical implementations of this proposal if any\n\n**Timeline and Roadmap:** Include a suggested roadmap and immediate next steps required for a minimum viable project.\n\n**Voting options:** Mention the options that will be included on the snapshot vote, including an “Abstain” one.\n\n**II) Different proposals categories:**\n*BlackPool Integration Request (BPIR):* (focus on public information and investments)\nDescription: BPIRs should present projects with a full report and a post to integrate a new verticale on BlackPool, either with blockchain games, public DAO investments or partnerships that need to go through the LAB (meeting of BlackPool experts about the different BPIRs opportunites)\nThe LAB will take the decision, with the help of a community sentiment poll, to move forward with the proposed projects or not.\nThe process works with two types of proposals:\n\nBPIR which will share a report about the project, define the partnership/investment idea\nBPGPs for any DAO expenses\nThis type of proposal should include, in addition to all the points mentioned in the first part:\n\nProject Presentation: (After summary)\nProject name\nFull report about the project\nPartnerships\nCompetitors\nAudit(s) links\nSupported chain(s)\nTwitter/Discord/Telegram links\n\nProject metrics: (After project presentation)\nCurrent project FDV or TVL\nDaily volume\nCommunity size on Twitter/Discord/Telegram\n\nIt’s also a good point to have a meeting between the project team and the BP Team to discuss the proposal over a call before the next LAB meeting. (private)\n\n**Community sentiment poll:**\nThe report needs to be shared on the forum Monday evening or before, for the next Lab meeting on Thursday.\nIn addition to the Lab meeting, a community member can present a scout call about the project on discord for the community members.\n\nIntegration proposals can happen quite often and the decision to move forward will be taken by the Lab with the help of a community poll, so it might not always require a snapshot proposal.\n\n**Proposal specifications:**\nAdmins: Lab meeting members (Core team) + Community poll on the forum\nCommunity feedback: 2 days minimum\nVoting duration 3 days\nQuorum: As we are still in the migration phase for veBPT, each quorum will be voted on later.\n\n*BlackPool Governance Proposal (BPGP):*\nDescription: BPGPs are about common governance proposals, especially the ones related to the treasury and the DAO organization. This is the 2nd step after a project gets approved at the Lab meeting every Thursday, but this kind of proposal can also be used for anything related to DAO expenses.\nThis type of proposal should include, in addition to all the points mentioned in the first part:\n\n**Context:** (After summary)\nComprehensive overview of the proposal, treasury breakdown if needed.\n\nThe BPGPs would concern but wouldn’t be limited to:\n- Quarterly budgets (including a LAB budget)\n- Liquidity mining gauge votes\n- Grant program if any\n- Contributors/DAO Committees rewards\n- Long term partnerships (i.e DAO Swaps)\n- DAO expenses\n\nNote that some projects might offer private deals with confidential information which cannot be revealed. For these projects, a LAB budget will be created and managed by the LAB members to invest following internal discussion.\n\n**Proposal specifications:**\nAdmin(s): Team multisig\nCommunity feedback: 2 days minimum\nVoting duration: 5 days\nQuorum: As we are still in the migration phase for veBPT, each quorum will be voted on later.\n\n*BlackPool Improvement Protocol (BPIP):*\nDescription: BPIPs are about the most important modifications either on the protocol directly or on the governance framework. This category concerns every major change in the code, a token migration or the creation of new features, etc.\nThis type of proposal should include, in addition to all the points mentioned in the first part:\n**Context:** What is creation/modification and why it is needed?\n\nThe BPIPs would concern but wouldn’t be limited to:\n- New version of the protocol\n- Smart contract modification\n- Updates on the initial parameters\n- Token migration\n- Governance framework modification\n- Add/Remove a signer on the treasury multisig\n- Modification of the protocol fees distribution\n\nBPIPs are the most critical and important types of proposals, as it’s directly about the BlackPool core product or a major change in the governance.\nIt’s very important to get as many community members aware of this kind of proposal for them to vote accordingly, which is why we should consider more conservative parameters than BPGPs ones, and a longer voting period:\n\n**Proposal specifications:**\nAdmin: Team multisig\nCommunity feedback: 2 days minimum\nVoting duration: 8 days\nQuorum: As we are still in the migration phase for veBPT, each quorum will be voted on later.\n\nEach type will be detailed in a template for each category on the forum.\n\n**Treasury allocations:**\nThe treasury allocations will be shared into a category called \"Treasury Management\"\nThis category will include monthly reports about the treasury actions taken, suggestion channels and community polls to consider new strategies.\n\n**Voting options:**\nYes, accept the governance framework\nNo, refuse the governance framework\nAbstain",

      "title": "Blackpool DAO Expenses for March 2022",
      "content": "BlackPool DAO Expenses for March 2022\nForum post: https://gov.blackpool.finance/t/blackpool-dao-expenses-for-march-2022/164\n\nWith BlackPool growing on all fronts—TVL, number of verticals, contributor head count—operational costs are steadily increasing. This is a good problem to have, as a barometer of our success, but it means we will need to stay organized, strategic, and transparent in our spending.\n\n**Summary:**\nThis proposal outlines in detail the costs incurred by the DAO in March, 2022, and seeks approval. Going forward, we will publish these expense reports on a regular basis as we push to develop best-in-class operational practices.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe goal of this proposal is to bring more transparency to the BlackPool treasury. A governance framework is already in work (and should be ready next month), which should facilitate better visibility of the governance, and present a monthly budget for the DAO costs.\n\nThis proposal seeks approval for the DAO expenses for March 2022.\n\n**Mainnet expenses:**\n\n**IT & Tech Infrastructure:**\nAll IT & Tech infrastructure will be provided as a service by an external partner focused on Administration and maintaining.E.g: AWS, Vercel, Github, and other tools and services needed by the DAO\n\n- Effective cost servers infrastructure: 11,250.00 USDC\n- Reserve 15% infrastructure budget : 1,750.00 USDC\n- Effective Admin & Tooling costs: 7,915.00 + 4,765.00 = 12,680.00 USDC\n- Reserve 6.5% Admin & Tooling budget : 820.00 USDC\nTotal monthly costs: 26,500.00 USDC\n\n**Legal & Tax:**\nAs regulation and AML rules are getting tighter, the DAO must have a solid legal base on which operations take part. The DAO will continue to mandate an experienced advisory already working with major projects on the blockchain.\n\n- Effective Cost for the Legal & Tax expense: 24,670.00 USDC\n- Reserve 25% in case of additional legal costs: 6,330.00 USDC\nTotal monthly legal budget: 31,000.00 USDC\n\n**Marketing/ Events:**\nAs the DAO competes against other significant players, marketing actions like events are needed to raise awareness of DAO and improve our market presence. \nThe budget for events and marketing is 70 000 USDC/month. The budget can be split depending on the amount of events and marketing.\n\n- Effective cost for March events: 61,125.00 USDC\n- Reserve 15% in case of additional marketing costs: 8,875.00 USDC\nTotal monthly budget: 70,000.00 USDC\n\n**Audits:**\nThere aren’t any audits planned for now, but it can be useful to get the funds ready. The audit costs are estimated to 50,000.00 USDC/quarter, however the cost can change depending on the complexity:\n\n- Effective Audits costs to pay for Q1 2022: 0.00 USDC\n- Reserve in case of audits in Q2 2022: 50,000.00 USDC\nTotal monthly audits budget: 50,000.00 USDC\n\n**Polygon expenses:**\n\n**Contributors:**\nThe contributors rewards are estimated to 35,145 USDC/month for their work:\n\n- Effective contributors rewards for March 2022: 35,145.00 sdam3CRV\n- Reserve 25% in case of new hires: 8,855.00 sdam3CRV\nTotal monthly contributors budgett : 44,000.00 sdam3CRV\n\nThe total of the reserves is 67,775.00 USDC + 8,855.00 sdam3CRV. These reserves should be used to generate a yield if unspent.\n",
