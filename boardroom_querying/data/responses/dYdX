      "title": "DRC - Ambassador Program Continuation",
      "content": "Summary:\nOn May 1st, 2022, 16 community members enrolled in an Ambassador Program to foster community-led ecosystem growth. Six Burrows were formed: Analytics, Governance, Media, Risk, Student, and User Onboarding and Education.\n\nTo date, documented successes, performance, challenges, future KPIs and goals have been illustrated on the commonwealth forums. Future documentation will also be posted on Notion under Burrow Projects. This is an open workbook where the community can see each project Ambassadors are working on and the KPIs keeping them accountable.\n\nAs of today, 13 Ambassadors and 5 Burrows (Analytics, Governance, Media, Risk and User Onboarding & Education) have expressed interest in continuing as dYdX Ambassadors.\n\nBased on the above, this Snapshot vote has been created by the Ambassadors to determine whether the Ambassador Program should continue into Season 2 (September 1st - November 31st).\n\nContext:\nIn the initial Ambassador Program post, the dYdX Foundation announced that a community vote would occur in Season 2 to establish whether or not to continue with the current Ambassador Program structure and each respective Burrow.\n\nThe dYdX Grants Program recently announced that a portion of the capital ($400,000) in v1.5 will be given to Ambassador Burrows to support the program with funding and assistance. Ambassadors currently receive an hourly rate of $25 per hour capped at 20 hours per week ($2,000 max). Each Burrow receives $10,000 per quarter to fund self-directed initiatives.\n\nAmbassadors are required to showcase the benefits and value that they are creating for the dYdX community. Transparency and alignment are key pillars of the Ambassador Program, with a focus on showcasing the value proposition and the steps taken to maximize impact - See recent Season 1 Reflections & Season 2 plans from the Analytics, Governance, Media, Risk and User Onboarding & Education Burrows.\n\nRationale:\nWhy does the dYdX ecosystem need Ambassadors?\n\ndYdX V4 will be fully decentralized. As the dYdX DAO scales, multiple individuals and working groups will be contributing to the development of the ecosystem. The Ambassador Program was originally formed to replicate DAO working group structures and has arguably done a great job at showcasing the high standards of the dYdX community.\n\nIt’s imperative that dYdX has a strong set of contributors driving growth, sustainability, and adoption of the protocol from a community perspective.",

We found that:\n\n- Liquidity provider rewards have been largely dominated by 2 addresses for a significant period of time\n- dYdX is overpaying for deep liquidity, while more active liquidity is being penalized, i.e., Liquidity providers are rewarded for their ability to show size, rather than compete for market share\n- Introducing maker volume into the calculation of rewards and reducing the weight on stkDYDX, depth & spread, will allow for a more equitable reward share\n-Rewarding maker volume will incentivize active liquidity at the top of the order book; tightening spreads and creating a better trading environment for users\n\nWintermute proposes to introduce maker volume through Proposed Change A with a parameter weight of v = 0.45, as well as reduce the parameter weighting of stkDYDX and depth/spread to s = 0.2 and d = 0.35, respectively.\n\n## Voting options\n1.

      "content": "### Summary\n\nWe at Xenophon Labs recently conducted research on the trader rewards mechanism. Among our findings were the following:\n\n1. Incentivizing open interest through the trader rewards formula has not shown a noticeable impact on long-term growth of the protocol.\n2. There is evidence that total fees paid by takers will change proportionally with a change in the fee weight parameter; for instance, an increase of 10% of the fee weight parameter is expected to lead to an increase of 10% in the total fees paid by takers.\n\nWe propose increasing the fee weight parameter from `a=0.67` to `a=0.8`, while decreasing the open interest weight parameter from `b=0.28` to `b=0.15`. This should constitute a 19% (`.8/.67`) increase in taker fees.\n\n### Voting Options\n\n- `Yes`: increase the fee weight parameter from `a=0.67` to `a=0.8`, and decrease the open interest weight parameter from `b=0.28` to `b=0.15`.\n- `No`: do nothing.\n\n### Links\n\n- [Trader Rewards Formula Docs](https://docs.dydx.community/dydx-governance/rewards/trading-rewards)\n- [Forum Discussion](https://forums.dydx.community/discussion/4190-discussion-dydx-trader-rewards-mechanism-review)\n- [Research Paper](https://xenophonlabs.com/dydx_trade_rewards.pdf)\n- [Blog Post](https://mirror.xyz/xenophonlabs.eth/I7BeQC37w3RxH3rxQD5nNznmr3-20rDlh5v1naye68w)",

We propose that the 8 person multi-sig committee (the “Grants Committee”) act as trustees (the “Trustees”) for this entity, with Reverie acting as the enforcer (the “Enforcer”) and the assets currently in the Grants Committee multi-sig becoming part of the Purpose Trust. (We explain these terms in greater depth below). Operating the DGP under this structure will offer many benefits to the DGP, including greater flexibility to distribute funds to grantees and engage in off-chain activity, minimization of the tax burden for the DAO, and legal protection for the grants lead (Reverie) and the committee members.\n\nUntil now, DAO-funded initiatives have run into significant operational and legal challenges. We believe the Purpose Trust is a big step towards solving those hurdles and paving a path forward for the industry. \n\nShould the DGP implement a Guernsey Purpose Trust?\n",
