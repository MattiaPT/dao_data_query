      "title": "SDGP-45: Activate boost delegation yield sharing for the CRV liquid locker & initiate it with a strategic veCRV boost delegation",
      "content": "Author : Hubert, Chago\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe veBoostDelegation yield sharing for the CRV liquid locker is a smart-contract allowing any veCRV holder to delegate their veCRV boost to the Stake DAO CRV Liquid Locker. The delegation will boost the CRV yield across all Stake DAO OnlyBoost strategies thanks to an improved overall veCRV boost position.\n\nThe CRV performance fees accrued from boosting Curve LP on Stake DAO, typically reserved for sdCRV holders, are automatically shared between the Stake DAO CRV Liquid Locker staked sdCRV holders and the veCRV delegators.\n\nSummary:\n\nThis proposal aims to activate this mechanism and initiate it with a 52 million veCRV boost delegation from Michael Egorov, Curve’s founder, in an automated exchange for 40% outperformance on Stake DAO’s Curve boosted strategies under current conditions, resulting in:\n\n500k SDT to be locked as veSDT (4 years) subject to approval of SDGP-44\n\nThe share of Stake DAO’s CRV Liquid Locker performance fees in CRV, proportional to the delegated veCRV boost’s contribution to Stake DAO’s total veCRV boost, accrued from the veBoostDelegation smart contract.\n\nTransactions will be executed through smart contracts deployed within Stake DAO, ensuring all flows will remain entirely within the DAO, with no manual intervention and maximum decentralisation.\n\nRationale:\n\nThis delegation of significant veCRV boost represents a strategic allocation to improve Stake DAO’s position within the Curve ecosystem, bringing Stake DAO to over 20% of Curve’s total boost supply. It will increase the share of Onlyboost TVL going through the Stake DAO locker and paying fees to veSDT, sdCRV and the treasury. It should also help grow the TVL of those Onlyboost.\n\nThe move aims to increase TVL for Stake DAO and solidify Onlyboost’s position as the leading CRV rewards yield provider.\n\nFurthermore, it aligns even more Stake DAO’s interests with Curve’s long-term success while fully deploying the Onlyboost architecture on Curve Finance.\n\nProposal Specifications:\n\nMichael Egorov to delegate for 4 years 52 million veCRV boost via Stake DAO veBoostDelegation smart contract to share CRV performance fees.\n\nStake DAO to allocate 500k SDT from its treasury to Michael Egorov to lock as veSDT using smart contract as part of the 40% outperformance on Stake DAO’s Curve boosted strategies as compensation.\n\nThe delegated boost will be used to increase yields across all Stake DAO Curve boosted strategies.\n\nA share of Liquid Locker performance fees in CRV will be allocated to Michael Egorov based on the delegated boost. The distribution will follow the Liquid Locker fee structure and be fully automated, with no manual steps required.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis proposal leverages Stake DAO’s decentralized framework to execute a strategic delegation of 52 million veCRV, enhancing yields and reinforcing its competitive position in the Curve ecosystem. The automated, smart contract-based process ensures transparency and efficiency, aligning with DeFi principles while maximizing financial performance.\n\nAdministrators: veSDT holders\nCommunity Feedback: Minimum of 3 days\nVoting Duration: 7 days",

      "title": "SDGP-44: Proposal for the Transfer of up to 1M SDT from the Stake DAO Association Pool to Stake DAO",
      "content": "Author: @Lior @chago0x\n\nSummary:\n\nThis proposal seeks approval for the transfer of up to 1M from the Stake DAO Association’s pool to Stake DAO. The primary purpose of this transfer is to strengthen Stake DAO’s rewards pool, thereby ensuring sustained incentives for participants, liquidity providers, and key ecosystem contributors. This strategic allocation will enhance Stake DAO’s competitive positioning and promote long-term growth and stability.\n\nRationale:\n\nStake DAO operates within a highly competitive decentralized finance (DeFi) market, where robust incentive mechanisms are essential for maintaining liquidity, encouraging participation, and driving the overall success of the ecosystem. By transferring up to 1Mk SDT from the association pool to the DAO, we will reinforce the rewards pool, which plays a critical role in:\n\nEnhancing participation: Increased rewards attract more participants, improving Total Value Locked (TVL) and liquidity within Stake DAO’s strategies, particularly in Curve-boosted strategies.\n\nSustaining long-term growth: A well-capitalized rewards pool encourages long-term participation and lock-ups of veSDT, providing stability and aligning stakeholder incentives.\n\nStrengthening competitiveness: In a dynamic market, high rewards are crucial for retaining liquidity providers and growing Stake DAO’s market share in Curve and other DeFi ecosystems.\n\nBoosting governance engagement: With an enriched rewards pool, Stake DAO can incentivize active participation in governance, ensuring that decision-making aligns with\nthe best interests of the community and DAO’s long-term vision.\n\nProposal Specifications:\n\nTransfers of up to 1M SDT:\nSDT will be transferred from the Stake DAO Association pool to the DAO Treasury (eth:0xF930EBBd05eF8b25B1797b9b2109DDC9B0d43063).\n\nRewards pool allocation:\nThe SDT will be allocated to Stake DAO’s rewards pool to incentivize participants and boost yields across Curve-boosted strategies.\n\nGovernance:\nWith on-chain transparency, the transfer and allocation will be executed automatically upon approval via a Stake DAO governance vote.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis transfer from the association pool to Stake DAO represents the long-term commitment to the sustainability of the DAO’s rewards system. By bolstering the rewards pool, Stake DAO can strengthen its market position, enhance participant engagement, and ensure competitive incentives that drive continued growth and success.\n\nAdministrators: veSDT holders\nCommunity Feedback: Minimum of 3 days\nVoting Duration: 7 days",

      "title": "SDGP-43: Temporarily Pause Re-Locking of MAV Until Revenue Mechanism is Introduced or lock expire",
      "content": "Summary: This proposal seeks to temporarily pause the re-locking of MAV tokens within the sdMav contract. The re-locking mechanism will only be re-enabled if and when the MAV team introduces a revenue mechanism for veMav. Currently, no benefits are gained from locking MAV, making this a strategic move to protect our interests and potentially expedite the implementation of a revenue mechanism by the MAV team.\n\nMotivation: The lack of liquidity for sdMav stems from the MAV team’s delay in implementing a revenue mechanism for veMav. By pausing re-locking now, we start the 4-year unlocking clock, protecting ourselves from the possibility of the MAV team never implementing such a mechanism. This proposal also serves as a potential pressure point, as the MAV team may be compelled to act faster if they see veMav being lost and the risk of a token dump increases. Should other wrappers follow suit, this collective action could further incentivize the MAV team to prioritize the revenue mechanism.\n\nImplementation: Minimal developer time is required\n\nConclusion: This proposal is designed to protect our interests and potentially accelerate the introduction of a revenue mechanism for veMav by the MAV team. We encourage sdMav holders and the Stake DAO team to support this proposal.",

      "title": " SDGP-42: Move to the next stage for sdCAKE",
      "content": "Proposed by: Hubert\n\nSummary\nThis proposal aims to define how the Top Cake campaign will end, and how the sdCAKE locker can scale in the long term after the airdrop. It proposes to fix a date for the Top Cake snapshot, and to put in place the various liquidity maintenance mechanisms that are already used on Mainnet for other lockers.\n\nContext and motivation\nIn November 2023 the CAKE liquid locker was launched, and the Top Cake campaign started.\n\nNearly one year later, Stake DAO is the third largest holder of veCAKE, second biggest wrapper, and has the best peg amongst wrappers.\n\nIt is now time to move sdCAKE to the next phase to fuel its future growth.\n\nThe Top Cake campaign has been accumulating tokens and currently has around 400k SDT, which is a good amount to bootstrap users’ veSDT position.\n\nIn parallel, Stake DAO has been subsidising the liquidity of sdCAKE and SDT through a grant received from Binance which is now fully executed. There is a need to put in place a long term scalable liquidity solution, which can allow anyone to exit as smoothly as possible, and that can even showcase sdCAKE to new CAKE users.\n\nProposal specifications\nTop Cake campaign\nIt is suggested to set an end date to the Top Cake campaign on the 30th of September 2024 and to use the remaining time to enable the lock of the maximum possible CAKE amount until then. This means that:\n\nOn this date, a snapshot will be taken of the cherries, and the fees accumulated will be distributed soon after.\n\nSince there is an airdrop process, it also seems appropriate that Stake DAO formally acknowledges the ownership of the CAKE Liquid Locker.\n\nAfter the airdrop, sdCAKE voting becomes subject to veSDT boost.\n\nIdeally, when vlSDT becomes live, it is built in a way that allows users to lock SDT directly on other chains.\n\nLong term liquidity scalability\nAs for the long term liquidity, it is suggested that to follow the path showed by the other mainnet lockers, in particular the CRV liquid locker:\n\nsdCAKE in the liquidity pool will vote for the liquidity pool with 90% of the corresponding voting power (assuming they have minimum boost when boost is live)\n\nsdCAKE in the liquidity pool will vote for the SDT/BNB liquidity pool with 10% of the corresponding voting power (assuming they have minimum boost when boost is live)\n\nTwo thirds of sdCAKE fees on native CAKE rewards will be used to finance vote incentives for the sdCAKE/CAKE pool when the pool holds less than 10% of the sdCAKE supply\n\nImplementation\nThis proposal requires some developer time sized as follows:\n\n2-4 developper-days for the airdrop\n\n1-2 developper-days for the vote boosting implementation\n\n2-4 developper-days for the liquidity maintenance mechanisms\n\nNo other resources will be requested from the DAO.\n\nVoting options\nYae: agree with:\nStake DAO acknowledging the ownership of the CAKE liquid locker;\n\nSetting the date of September 30th 2024 as end date for Top Cake, and implementing the boosted voting power afterward\n\nPutting in place the liquidity maintenance mechanisms discussed above and present on other lockers\n\nNae: delay the decision on Top Cake’s end\n\nRework proposal\n\nAdmins: veSDT holders\n\nCommunity Feedback: Minimum 3 days\n\nVoting Duration: 7 days",

      "title": "SDGP#40 : Creating a Rewards allocation pool",
      "content": "Objective\n\nThis proposal aims to create a Rewards allocation pool to replace the current SDT inflation in strategies (currently 0.3 SDT per block, 788,400 SDT/year). By empowering the DAO community through a transparent and decentralized voting process, stakeholders will democratically determine the allocation of the entire SDT distribution to specific pools for designated periods. This approach not only aligns with our commitment to decentralization but also ensures a compliant and transparent mechanism for managing SDT resources in the best interest of the community.\n\nContext\n\nCurrently, OnlyBoost offers some of the best APRs on Curve, with an average improvement of 10%. However, an increase from 20% to 22%, for instance, is not always sufficient to justify its use. This initiative aims to bridge that gap and encourage the adoption of OnlyBoost.\n\nProposal Details\n\nCreation of the Rewards allocation pool:\nAllocate the 788,400 SDT per year (or approximately 65,700 SDT per month) that were previously distributed as strategy inflation to the Rewards allocation pool.\n\nPeriod Allocation:\nMonthly, the DAO will vote to determine which pool will receive the entire SDT allocation from the SDT Strategic Fund.\n\nStrategic Resource Allocation and OnlyBoost Adoption:\nThe Rewards allocation pool ensures that SDT inflation is utilized strategically, providing targeted incentives where most needed. It boosts OnlyBoost adoption by enhancing APRs through additional SDT allocations, attracting users, and aligning the DAO and user interests. This approach fuels the DAO’s revenue growth through increased platform usage.\n\nOptimized Gas Costs:\nThe new system will help optimize the gas costs associated with current harvests, of which SDT represents the most significant part. Concentrating SDT allocations to specific pools will reduce the frequency and complexity of transactions, thereby lowering users’ overall gas expenses.\n\nImplementation\n\nMinimal developer time is required to redirect the SDT inflation to the Rewards allocation pool and set up the reward mechanism.\n\nVoting Options:\n\nYAE\nNAE\n\nProposal Specifications:\n\nAdmins: veSDT holders\nCommunity Feedback: Minimum 3 days\nVoting Duration: 7 days",

This makes it less optimal to incentivize the Curve sdYFIYFI LP for Stake DAO.\n\nThe migration of the sdFXSFXS VBM from the Curve mainnet to the Curve Fraxtal gauge will better align with Frax ecosystem developments while maintaining the VBM on the Curve Votemarket.\n\nProposal Specifications:\n\nRemove the sdYFIYFI VBM from the SDT gauge controller.\nMigrate the sdFXSFXS VBM from the Curve mainnet gauge to the Curve Fraxtal gauge.\nAdmin: veSDT holders\nCommunity Feedback: Minimum of 3 days\nVoting Duration: 7 days",

      "title": "SDGP #38 : Harmonizing Fees among Lockers and Stake DAO Strategies",
      "content": "Objective\n\nThis proposal aims to harmonize all fees among Stake DAO Liquid Lockers and Strategies to improve readability and transparency for users.\n\nThe proposed structure is as follows:\n\nLockers: 15% performance fees on the native yield split as follows:\n\n10% Liquidity (VBM) if the ratio is below 10/90 (explained below)\n5% Treasury\nFor the PENDLE locker, any reward distributed in WETH by Pendle is considered a native reward (including voter rewards).\n\nMainnet strategies: 15.5-16% performance fees split as follow:\n\n5% sdTKN-gauge holders\n5% veSDT\n5% Treasury\n0.5%-1% Harvester fee to guarantee frequent harvest of the strategies\nSidechain strategies: 15% performance fees for the treasury\n\nBackground and Motivation\n\nThis proposal builds on SDGP #21, which aims to optimize and scale liquidity pools, particularly the sdCRV/CRV pool on Curve. By extending this approach to all lockers (sdTKN), this proposal aims to harmonize fees across the entire Stake DAO ecosystem, allowing for better resource facilitation and increased financial transparency.\n\nThose fees only apply to a small part of the yield for the lockers, specifically the native yield. By design, the lockers also generate yield from vote incentives, which are not affected by this harmonization.\n\nLockers:\n\nLiquidity Fees (VBM): a 10% fee on native yield (e.g., 3CRV for the CRV locker) will be allocated automatically (through Vote Bounty Manager contracts) to vote incentives on Votemarket for the corresponding liquidity pool (e.g., sdCRV/CRV) when liquidity is below the target ratio of 10/90.\n\nTreasury Fees: A 5% fee will be allocated to the DAO treasury to support ongoing platform development, audits and operational costs.\n\nMainnet strategies:\n\nsdTKN-gauge Holders: A 5% fee will be allocated to sdTKN-gauge holders, recognizing their engagement and contribution to the ecosystem.\n\nveSDT: A 5% fee will be allocated to veSDT holders.\n\nTreasury Fees: A 5% fee will be allocated to the DAO treasury to support ongoing platform development, audits and operational costs.\n\nHarvester fee: 0.5%-1% to guarantee frequent harvest of the strategies\n\nThe 10/90 Ratio Explained\n\nThe 10/90 ratio is a target used to ensure a balanced and effective distribution of liquidity between sdTKN in the liquidity pool and sdTKN within the respective gauge. This ratio is crucial for maintaining the stability and efficiency of liquidity pools, ensuring minimum target liquidity for lockers.\n\nDefinition of the 10/90 Ratio:\n\n10% sdTKN in the Pool: this represents the portion of sdTKN tokens that should be within the sdTKN liquidity pool.\n\n90% sdTKN in the Gauge: This represents the portion of sdTKN tokens that should be within the sdTKN locker gauge.\n\nImportance of the 10/90 Ratio:\n\nLiquidity Stability: Ensures sufficient liquidity in the pool to facilitate smooth transactions and swaps mechanism while avoiding the incentivization of the liquidity pool if it becomes overloaded with sdTKN.\n\nOptimized Rewards: The ratio helps optimize the distribution of rewards. By maintaining a balanced mix of sdTKN in the pool and the gauge, and because the sdTKN in the pool forfeits their yield, the rewards for sdTKN stakers are enhanced.\n\nSustainable Growth: By adhering to this ratio, the liquidity pool can grow sustainably, attracting more users and increasing overall liquidity as the locker scales.\n\nSecurity: in the Liquid Locker model, the tokens locked in underlying project’s veTKN contracts cannot move anywhere, and are therefore not at risk. The only tokens at risk of a smart contract failure or hack are the ones in the liquidity pool. It is therefore important that the liquidity pool doesn’t become too big compared to the overall locker.\n\nWhat happens when the ratio is over 10/90?:\n\nWhen the amount of sdTKN in liquidity is above the 10% threshold, the fees are simply sent to the treasury. The treasury can always allocate them to deposit vote incentives if required or simply as normal treasury funds.\n\nImplementation\n\nMinimal developer time is needed to implement this proposal, and no additional treasury resources are required.\n\nProposal Specifications\n\nAdmins: veSDT holders\nCommunity Feedback: Minimum 3 days\nVoting Duration: 7 days",

      "content": "Author : chago0x\n\nSummary:\n\nThis proposal invites the community to consider whether Stake DAO should allocate up to $500,000 in the initial liquidity seed of the Usual project for a four-month period.\n\nFollowing Stake DAO’s successful history of participating in liquidity provision for projects like the f(x) Protocol and Reserve Protocol, this initiative aims to manage Stake DAO’s treasury to ensure its continued productivity.\n\nContext:\n\nWebsite : https://usual.money/ 9\nX : https://x.com/usualmoney\n\nUsual is a pioneering stablecoin initiative aimed at fostering a more equitable, transparent, and decentralized financial ecosystem. It challenges the status quo of traditional stablecoins, which have attracted criticism for their centralized control and ethical concerns.\n\nThe proposed participation in Usual is not just an ordinary liquidity provision; it’s a four-month bond that rewards Stake DAO with points. These points will later give potential rights to claim USUAL tokens. According to Usual team, the yield for the pre-launch period ranges between 41% (if FDV/TVL = 1) and 430% (if FDV/TVL = 8 which is Ethena’s multiple).\n\nThis innovative financial instrument is designed to potentially complement Stake DAO with a profitable return on its treasury investment, thereby supporting Usual’s launch and ensuring its stability.\n\nAdditionally, this initiative opens the door to further collaborations between Stake DAO and Usual, particularly in areas like Liquid Lockers and the Votemarket. Such partnerships could enhance Stake DAO’s ecosystem presence, creating more avenues for value creation and engagement in cutting-edge decentralized finance projects.\n\nProposal Specifications:\n\nAdmin: veSDT holders\nCommunity Feedback Period: Minimum of 3 days\nVoting Duration: 7 days\nAllocation Details: Up to $500,000 from the treasury for a four-month bond, with potential returns paid out in points redeemable for USUAL tokens.",

      "title": "SDGP#33 Proposed multisig structure",
      "content": "Authors:\nHubert\n\nSummary\nProposed new structure of Safe multisigs for the DAO to maximize security and decentralisation.\n\nContext\nMost of Stake DAO’s contracts have a governance address that is still entitled to performing certain defined changes to the contract. In some cases, such changes could theoretically be used in a malicious way to steal user funds (for example, setting withdrawal fees to 100%, etc.).\n\nThis creates a security risk for users, as no multisig is ever 100% safe. It also creates a legal uncertainty for the DAO and its multisig signers as the technical possibility to maliciously steal funds from users could be misinterpreted as a form of custody. It is therefore critical to limit these risks, and for that, to find a decentralised solution for the access to Stake DAO contracts.\n\nHowever, Stake DAO has a significant treasury which is key to its operation. It’s used in an agile manner, voting for Stake DAO pools ensuring the DAO has solid liquidity, and allowing the DAO to accumulate strategic tokens such as CRV, FXS, etc. in a sizable manner, which is critical for the DAO’s operation. This agile management requires reactivity and flexibility.\n\nThere are therefore conflicting needs for our governance: security and decentralization for the DAO contracts, reactivity and efficiency for the DAO treasury.\n\nRationale\nThe suggested solution is to have the following multisig architecture for all chains:\n\nContract owner Safe\nTreasury management Safe\nEmergency DAO\nContract owner Safe\nPurpose: owns the governance of Stake DAO contracts.\n\nAssets: only DAO owned SDT.\n\nOwners:\n\nEmergency DAO (with only the power of blocking transactions and activating kill switches)\nOn-chain governance (veSDT vote, technical solution to be discussed)\nSigning rule: 1/2\n\nComment: This is the most important Safe as it holds potentially the possibility to steal funds from users. The idea here is to try to have something which is fully decentralized and make sure nothing can really happen on Stake DAO without approval from the community. An emergency DAO is necessary as on-chain governance bears its own risks (governance attack or mistake could lead to loss of user funds).\n\nTreasury Safe\nPurpose: Manage the treasury of the DAO in a way that serves the DAO’s best interest and supports the development of the protocol.\n\nAssets: holds most of the assets of the DAO.\n\nOwners: 5 members plus 3 suppleants (who can replace a member in case of any going on holydays or being ill, etc.) elected via governance votes to form a treasury committee\n\nSigning rule: 3/5\n\nComment: The idea of this Safe is to support the DAO’s development thanks to a smart use of its cryptos accumulated over time through the use of strategic liquidity provision, liquidity mining, incentivisation of liquidity provision and votes, etc. (which requires a lot of flexibility and reactivity). The challenge is to find a way to keep this flexibility, while limiting the risk (still technically existing) of mis-use of DAO’s assets by signers of the Safe.\n\nEmergency DAO\nPurpose: Protect the DAO in case of governance attack or material risk on the contract owner multisig.\n\nAssets: none.\n\nOwners:\n\n6 members from the ecosystem and community, elected through a community vote. They could be significant users and counterparties.\nSigning rule: [3/6] to be discussed.\n\nComment: Members outside of the active contributors who are here to protect the DAO from governance attacks and emerging risks (could be notably a very quick action that needs to be taken in case of a hack, for example). It can only activate a kill switch or block a transaction. Need to be present in time zones that enable emergency situations to be dealt with at any time of the day and week.\n\nTransition\nTechnical solutions for on-chain governance need to be studied and decided upon with the community. Possible solution: oSnap, Zodiac + Governor contract, Tally, etc. A separate proposal will focus on this.\n\nTransition can be fairly smooth, but of course, this needs further confirmation after a decision on the voting solution.\n\nThe current multisig (0xF930EBBd05eF8b25B1797b9b2109DDC9B0d43063) would become the “Contract owner Safe”. For this, the following steps would be needed:\n\nBuild the on-chain governance structure (regardless of the solution)\nDeploy the emergency DAO\nChange 2 of the current signers of the Safe for the two above\nChange signature requirements from 4 to 1\nWithdraw the other former signers\nThe treasury management multisig would be created from scratch and given the corresponding signing structure.\n\nUntil the voting structure is decided upon and implemented, the treasury management will stay in the current multisig (0x930), and the elected committee will be set as the owner of this multisig with the target signing structure of the treasury management multisig.\n\nThe other Stake DAO safes on side chains would be given the same signing structure and fall under the treasury management umbrella.\n\nAll assets from the Contract owner Safe apart from the SDTs in wallet would be sent via a governance proposal to the treasury manager contract.\n\nMeans\nThe implementation of such a proposal will require significant work from contributors.\n\nDepending on the voting infrastructure chosen, developer requirements will vary.\n\nEmergency DAO members need to be identified, as well as treasury managers, and governance votes will need to pass.\n\nA minimum of three governance votes will be required after this one to complete the execution of this proposal.\n\nImmediate next steps if the proposal passes:\nLaunch the election of the treasury management multisig signers.\nLaunch a proposal detailing the various solutions for on-chain governance to choose the best path for Stake DAO contracts’ ownership.\nProposal specifications:\nAdmin: veSDT holders\nCommunity feedback: 3 days minimum\nVoting Duration: 7 days",

      "title": "SDGP#32 - Define the role of StakeDAO Association Category: Governance Proposal ",
      "content": "Author: StakeDAO Association\n\n1. Summary\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to confirm the list of services (“Services”) to be provided by the StakeDAO Association based in Zug, c/o Sielva Management SA Gubelstrasse 11 CH - 6300 Zug (“Association”), to Stake DAO (“DAO”). This ensures that the DAO maintains oversight over the services provided by the Association, aligning with the DAO’s interests and governance protocols.\n\n2. Context\n\nThe Association has been established in accordance with the laws of Switzerland late last year and shall be a key partner in the Stake DAO ecosystem. In line with its statutory purpose and following the approval of this Proposal, the Association shall provide the Services (as detailed below) to the DAO to assist the DAO in its continued growth and in achieving its goals.\n\nFor the provision of the Services, the Association shall receive grants from the DAO. The amount of each grant shall be set out in a grant agreement on an arm’s length basis. Each grant will require specified milestones or other detailed specifications to be listed.\n\nThe Association is free to decide upon the way to carry out the execution or fulfilment of the milestone(s) or the specific purpose set out in the respective grant agreement. The Association is free to (i) perform and execute the necessary steps itself or (ii) engage suitable third parties as auxiliary persons.\n\nIn addition, in line with its statutory purpose, the Association shall become the sole owner of any intellectual property rights in and to any kind of work products that have been created or will be created relevant to and in the context of the Stake DAO ecosystem (“Rights”). Following the approval of this Proposal, to the extent that (within such Rights), the DAO owns any intellectual property rights (both now and in the future, including such rights in and to work products that have been created under freelancer, service or other agreements and those that will be created in the context of grants as set forth below), the DAO shall assign and transfer all such rights to the Association. In the case the DAO should decide to no longer give grants to the Association and not to consider the Association as a partner in the Stake DAO ecosystem, all Rights (including those rights transferred to the Association by the DAO according to this provision, regardless of who or what entity assigned or transferred such rights to the Association) shall be transferred by the Association to the entity designated by the DAO through a governance decision.\n\n3. Rationale\n\nThe DAO is being consulted on the list of services to be rendered by the Association to the DAO. Below is a brief (non-exhaustive) description of potential services to be provided:\n\nServices\tDescriptions\nAssistance in Operation and Maintenance\t- Ensuring the continuity of the DAO’s operations\n- Governance support\nUse and Management of Grants\t- Using the grants received from the DAO in line with the milestones defined in the respective grant agreement;\n- Assisting the DAO in administering the grants to be distributed from and to be received by the DAO, i.e., to perform KYC checks, to ensure compliance with grant terms, etc.\nResearch & Development\t- Development of new products\n- Improvement of existing products\n- Managing audits\n- Risk management\nLegal Support\t- Legal representation (entering into contractual agreements on behalf of the DAO, etc.)\n- Regulatory monitoring\n- Legal consulting\n- Intellectual Property management (holding and managing intellectual property rights)\nWorkforce Management\t- Assisting in contracting processes (if needed)\nThe DAO may propose any other service currently missing on the above list and that is deemed to be essential for the further development of the DAO and the Stake DAO ecosystem.\n\n4. Grant Conditions\n\nThe Association shall use the grants received from the DAO in good faith solely for and in connection with the Stake DAO project and the Stake DAO ecosystem. Any other use without the prior consent of the DAO is prohibited. Unused funds may, at the sole discretion of the DAO and subject to acceptance by the DAO, be rolled over to another subsequent grant agreement and be spent in accordance with the new milestones or purpose, set forth therein. If any part of a grant cannot be used in accordance with the Stake DAO project or ecosystem and according to the milestones set out in the relevant grant agreement, it shall be returned to the DAO.\n\nThe grants paid by the DAO to the Association include any Value Added Tax (“VAT”) (if applicable).\n\nThe grants may be used for the payment of income tax, capital tax, VAT and tax at source or withholding tax, and any other taxes of the Association if such taxes apply and are related to the grant or the activities mentioned above.\n\nThe Association commits to produce half-yearly reports on the spending of the grants. It will list expenses in a summarized form and inform about the ongoing initiatives for which the funds are used. The report will be published in written form on the DAO’s governance forum.\n\nThe Association shall inform the DAO of any event or change in circumstances that could reasonably affect its ability to perform any of the grant conditions listed herein.\n\nThe Association does not guarantee any success related to its activities under the grant agreements to be concluded and all liabilities except for gross negligence, wilful intent and fraud are excluded.\n\nThis Governance Proposal and all the subsequent grant agreements shall in all respects be governed by and construed in accordance with substantive laws of Switzerland (to the exclusion of the Vienna Convention on the Contracts of the Sale of Goods). Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Governance Proposal as well as the subsequent grants and corresponding grant agreements shall exclusively be referred to the courts competent for the city of Zug, Switzerland.\n\n5. Proposal Specifications\n\nAdmin(s): veSDT holders\nCommunity feedback: 3 days min\nVoting duration: 7 days\n\nDo you agree to entrust the StakeDAO Association with the provision of the services to Stake DAO?",

Instead of holding our veSDT and the gauge tokens on the same contract, we opted for a 2-contracts logic, that allows modularity and adaptability.\n\nThis multisig will be used for:\n- Permanently lock SDT that are converted to cvgSDT;\n- Permanently delegate the veBoost to the second contract which holds gauge tokens;\n- Votes on Stake DAO gauge weights, according to metagovernance operations, handled with mgCVG.\n\nLater on, custom modules will be added so everyone can, in a permissionless manner:\n- Lock SDT that are not yet locked on the multisig;\n- Extend the lock duration;\n- Update/extend the veBoost delegation;\n- Claim rewards;\n- Send rewards to the cvgSDT buffer.\n\nIn order to ensure a fair execution of the metagovernance, and every other action that is needed, the multisig members are:\n- Wireshark (Convergence co-founder);\n- Solidity Ashtray (Convergence co-founder);\n- Robo-Odin (Convergence Proto-DAO member);\n- Chago (Stake DAO core team);\n- Hubert (Stake DAO core team).\n\nThe multisig will function with a 3/5 threshold.\n\n—- Means -—\n\nWhitelist the following address: 0x6ceE94bFCD5a7dEFDBEF337Bf79fE31D0982CF2A\n\n—- Votes -—\n\n1- WL Convergence's multisig;\n2- Do not WL Convergence's multisig.",

      "content": "**Summary:**\nThis proposal suggests consolidating the current SDIP, SDIR, and SDGP categories into a single, streamlined Stake DAO Governance Proposal (SDGP) category to simplify governance processes.\n\n**Detailed Description:**\nIn an effort to simplify the governance process within Stake DAO, this proposal recommends the unification of the existing proposal categories—SDIP (Improvement Protocol), SDIR (Integration Request), and SDGP (Governance Proposal)—into a single category: SDGP (Stake DAO Governance Proposal). The intention is to reduce complexity, align governance activities under a cohesive structure, and enhance community participation.\n\nThe unified SDGP category will encompass all aspects of the previous categories, including protocol improvements, integrations, and common governance motions. This change aims to make the proposal process more accessible to veSDT holders, ensuring that governance remains agile and responsive to the needs of the Stake DAO community.\n\nUnder the proposed unified SDGP framework, the following specifications will apply:\n\n- Admin: All proposals will be administered by veSDT holders, ensuring that those with a vested interest in the protocol have control over its governance decisions.\n\n- Community Feedback: Each proposal will require a minimum of 3 days for community feedback on the governance forum. This period allows veSDT holders to deliberate, suggest modifications, and reach a consensus before the voting process begins.\n\n- Voting Duration: The voting on proposals will last for 7 days, giving veSDT holders ample time to participate in the decision-making process.\n\n- Quorum: A minimum quorum of 15% is required for a proposal to be considered valid. This ensures that a significant portion of the community is involved in decision-making, leading to outcomes that more accurately reflect the collective will of the veSDT holders.\n\n**Means:**\n- Human resources: Minimal time needed\n- Treasury resources: N/A\n- Technical Implementation: N/A\n\n**Proposal specifications:**\n- Admin: veSDT holders\n- Community feedback: 2 days minimum\n- Voting Duration: 5 days",

It involves optimizing the voting process and fee structure as follows:\n\nUtilize sdCRV tokens within the sdCRVCRV pool on Curve to vote for the sdCRVCRV pool, considering them as non-boosted (voting power = amount of sdCRV in the Curve pool * minimum boost).\n\nIntroduce a 10% fee on the Curve native yield (currently 3CRV) that will be used to allocate vote bounties on Votemarket specifically for the sdCRVCRV pool when liquidity is below the targeted amount (target 10/90 : see below).\n\nThis approach ensures that the sdCRVCRV liquidity pool grows over time and scales in alignment with the growth of the CRV Liquid Locker.\n\n**Background and Motivation:**\n\nOver the past months, the CRV Liquid Locker has experienced remarkable growth, with the veCRV locked increasing from 25 million to 50 million. However, the sdCRVCRV liquidity has remained stagnant, with 2,200,000 sdCRV and 1,300,000 CRV inside the Curve pool.\n\nPreviously, the ratio between CRV inside the pool and sdCRV inside the sdCRV-gauge was above 10-90. Currently, the ratio has shifted below 5-95. Consequently, this proposal aims to optimize and scale the sdCRVCRV liquidity to address this discrepancy.\n\nTo optimize the sdCRVCRV liquidity, we propose utilizing sdCRV tokens within the sdCRVCRV pool on Curve for voting purposes. These tokens will be considered as non-boosted, resulting in the direction of votes towards the sdCRVCRV pool.\n\nWith the current amounts of 2,200,000 sdCRV inside the Curve pool and a minimum boost of x0.58, this will effectively increase by 50% the CRV rewards sent to the sdCRVCRV gauge, aiming to restore the desired 90-10 ratio.\n\nThis approach establishes a positive flywheel: as the sdCRV inside the sdCRVCRV pool increases, the pool receives more votes, facilitating the scaling of both the CRV liquid locker and the sdCRVCRV liquidity.\n\nIt’s important to note that this optimization has a limited impact on the APR of the sdCRV-gauges’ voting power, reducing it by only 1 point.\n\n–\n\nAdditionally, as the sdCRV inside the Curve pool increases, the Curve native yield (currently 3CRV) for sdCRV-gauge holders will also rise.

The process involves setting old sdTKNTKN gauges to weight 0, adding new sdTKNTKN votes bounties gauges created through the Vote Bounty Manager to the SDT Gauge Controller, and seeding these bounties with a 50,000 SDT budget.\n\nStake DAO’s use of the Vote Bounty Manager (VBM) serves as a model to present the tool to other DAOs, promoting innovation, user-friendly governance, and community engagement.\n\n**How the Vote Bounty Manager (VBM) Operates:**\n\nThe VBM simplifies the process of creating and managing vote bounties. Here’s how it works:\n\nVBM Creation: Managers create the VBM, similar to setting up a vote bounty on VoteMarket. However, instead of specifying a fixed vote bounty duration, they select a “target duration.” All other parameters, such as maximum vote price, blacklist settings, and token rewards, remain the same.\n\nFunding the VBM: The VBM’s manager can either send tokens directly to the VBM or establish a continuous token stream (from a Gauge Controller for example), ensuring a consistent supply of tokens for vote bounty rewards.\n\nUpdating the Vote Bounty: The VBM includes a public function “updateBounty” which can be called regularly, for example, every Thursday. When an update occurs, a number of periods are added to the ongoing vote bounty to match the “target duration”.\n\nToken Distribution: During each update, all tokens within the VBM are transferred to the vote bounty. These tokens are distributed evenly across all periods.\n\nExample https://etherscan.io/address/0xa79e61ea1a31f60a9df8926982bf0c1bb0d82d94#writeContract\n\n**Context:**\n\nStake DAO’s commitment to automation and decentralization is evident with the introduction of the \"Vote Bounty Manager” (VBM). This tool streamlines the creation and management of vote bounties. Redirecting SDT incentives towards sdTKN/TKN pool vote bounties demonstrates Stake DAO’s provides an opportunity to showcase the utility of the Vote Bounty Manager (VBM) and improves Liquid Locker’s liquidity.\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\nSet Old sdTKNTKN votes bounties Gauges to Weight 0: In the SDT gauge controller, old sdTKNTKN gauges will be set to weight 0 to stop directing incentives to outdated gauges.\n\nAdd New sdTKNTKN VBM Gauges created: Utilize the VBM to create and manage sdTKNTKN vote bounties and allow veSDT holders to vote for it throught adding them to the SDT Gauge Controller.\n\nSeed Vote Bounties with 50,000 SDT: Allocate a 50,000 SDT budget to seed these sdTKNTKN bounties.\n\n**Demonstrating Utility:**\n\nStake DAO’s use of the Vote Bounty Manager showcases its innovative approach to governance and votes bounty involvement.\n\nBy documenting success, sharing case studies, and initiating collaborations, Stake DAO can present the Vote Bounty Manager to other DAOs.\n\nThis positions Stake DAO as a model for efficient governance, user-friendliness, and community engagement.\n\n**Voting Options:**\n\n1. Support this proposal\n2. Rework this proposal\n\n**Proposal Specifications:**\n\n- Admin: veSDT holders\n- Community Feedback: Minimum 2 days.\n- Voting Duration: 5 days.",

      "content": "**Summary:**\n\nThe purpose of this proposal is to enable sdCRV holders to discuss and choose the method to be used when claiming the PRISMA token airdrop.\n\n**Context:**\n\nThe Prisma protocol recently launched and announced the arrival of their governance token: PRISMA.\nIt follows the veTokenomics model with its own parameters and mechanics. For more information, please visit the following links:\n\n- Prisma documentation: https://docs.prismafinance.com/\n- Prisma Mirror articles: https://mirror.xyz/prismafinance.eth\n\nAs Stake DAO has decided to vote in favor of the following Curve Governance Proposal: https://gov.curve.fi/t/whitelist-the-prisma-dao-curveproxy-contract/9494\n\nThe purpose of this post is to allow sdCRV holders to discuss and choose which method will be used to claim the airdrop.\n\n**Rationale:**\n\nThere are several options available:\n\n- Prisma has announced that eligible addresses will be able to fully claim their tokens only after a 52-week lock period. The first option is therefore to wait until the end of these 52 weeks.\n- Eligible addresses can also decide to accept a time-based penalty on the claimable amount, by deciding to claim before the end of these 52 weeks. The penalty decreases by 1/52 each week. The earlier a user claims, the fewer tokens they will receive.\n- Finally, Convex has announced the cvxPRISMA token, the liquid derivative of vePRISMA (https://twitter.com/ConvexFinance/status/1691459191297474560). Eligible addresses will be able to choose to claim cvxPRISMA at a 1:1 ratio. However, the liquidity factor must be taken into account, as it may lead to a temporary depeg and therefore a decrease in airdrop value.\n\n**Means:**\n\n- Human resources: Minimal developer time needed\n- Treasury resources: No treasury resources needed\n\n**Timeline and Roadmap:**\n\nAs of now, Prisma hasn’t given any ETA for the airdrop, but it is supposedly happening in the short-term future.\n\nVoting options:\n\n1. Wait for the 52-week lock and claim native PRISMA at a 1:1 ratio\n2. Claim the airdrop as cvxPRISMA\n3. Other (discuss other options on the Forum)\n\n**Proposal specifications:**\n\n- Admin(s): sdCRV holders\n- Community feedback: 2 days min\n- Voting duration: 5 days",

      "content": "Summary\nCut SDT incentives sent to the sdfrax3CRV gauge of Frax.\n\nContext\nStake DAO Frax v2 strategy receives incentives through the Frax gauge. Those SDT are minted at a rate of 0.03 SDT per block on Stake DAO side, and sent manually to the Frax gauge where they are streamed at a fixed rate per second.\n\nRational\nWhen we implemented incentives for the sdfrax3CRV gauge on Frax, this strategy held more than $100m and had a CRV APR exceeding 50%. It was a very good strategy for the DAO. However, when the focus of Frax moved to FraxBP, the APR went down, as well as the TVL. The strategy is therefore not making any profit anymore, while it is consuming 0.03 SDT per block (210 SDT per day).\nIn addition, maintaining those incentives requires significant manual maintenance that doesn’t fit the decentralisation requirement of Stake DAO. The gauge implementation by Frax requires a fixed stream per second, which prevents us from simply adding the Frax gauge in our strategy gauge controller.\nI therefore suggest that we deprecate these incentives.\n\nMeans\nIf this proposal is voted in favor, the following actions will be called by the Multisig:\n\nSetting SDT reward rate on Frax gauge (0xEB81b86248d3C2b618CcB071ADB122109DA96Da2) to 0.

      "title": "SDIR-30 : Whitelist Spiral DAO SDT Liquid Locker to lock $SDT",
      "content": "Project presentation:\n\nProtocol name: Spiral DAO\nWebsite: https://spiral.farm/\nDocumentation: https://docs.spiral.farm/\nAudits: https://docs.spiral.farm/risks-and-security/audits\nBug Bounty: Bug bounties - Spiral DAO\nTreasury Reports: Spiral DAO\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Spiral_DAO\nDiscord: Spiral DAO\nMedium: Spiral DAO - Medium\nGitbook: https://docs.spiral.farm/risks-and-security/deployed-contracts\n\nTL/DR :\nAllow Spiral DAO SDT Liquid Locker to lock $SDT as veSDT.\nAddress to whitelist: 0x4a6854B88Bfc87369cb9CA1A488e1A2Cf76748A1 1\n\nRationale:\nSpiral Locker presents the first liquid locker solution for SDT token holders. By offering a transferable and tradable wrapped version of SDT — sprSDT, users will be able to maintain liquid while benefiting from the many SDT benefits. The platform enables sprSDT staking for boosting power and additional incentives, delegation to various addresses, or participating as liquidity providers in the sprSDT/SDT pool on Curve for CRV emissions.\n\nSpiral Lockers are designed to retain the core features a real liquid locker should have:\n\nDeep liquidity allows holders to remain truly liquid\nKeeping holders in touch with the power they possess\nThe sprSDT holders in staking can manage their boosting power themselves by delegating boosts to their own address, or they can delegate their boosts to any other address. Additionally, sprSDT holders can delegate their boosts to Concentrator to receive Concentrator rewards in SPR every two weeks. Later on, once Paladin launches its new product, Paladin’s SDT boost market will be integrated into the Spiral website, enabling sprSDT holders to participate in Paladin boost marketplace and lend their SDT boosts to renters on Paladin, earning native rewards.\n\nMinting fee: 0%.\nStaking fee: for the first few months, Spiral DAO won’t take any fees. Later on, the fee will increase to 10%.\n\nMotivation:\nThe Spiral DAO Multisig treasury has already been whitelisted to lock SDT (SDIR-27 1) and has also activated the SDT incentives rewards on the COIL-FRAXBP staking pool (SDIR-26 1).\n\nCurrently, the Spiral Treasury holds 400k locked SDT and 300k SDT in Treasury. The first preminted sprSDT to kick-start liquidity and incentivize initial lockers will be backed by Treasury assets.\n\nMeans:\n\nHuman Resources: Minimal developer time needed.\nTreasury Resources: No treasury resources needed.\nTechnical Implementation: Update the SDT smart wallet whitelist.\n\nProposal Specifications:\nAdmin: veSDT holders\nCommunity feedback: 2 days minimum\nVoting Duration: 3 days",

      "title": "SDGP #17: Distribute Liquid Locker Votes Incentives in sdTKN (sdCRV, sdBAL, sdFXS, etc)",
      "content": "Summary:\n\nThis proposal aims to enhance the distribution of sdTKN-gauge holders’ vote incentives by utilizing sdTKN instead of SDT. The objective is to bolster the Liquid Locker positions while also supporting sdTKN pegs. The proposed approach involves buying, using Cowswap solvers routes, sdTKN from the market when it’s more profitable to do so and minting sdTKN when the sdTKN-TKN is at peg. This system is expected to reinforce the stability of sdTKN’s peg and improve Liquid Lockers’ overall position.\n\nIt also aims at facilitating the process of claiming and distributing vote incentives, to enable its full automation (and in the long term decentralisation).\n\nContext:\n\nFor more than a year, Stake DAO has been distributing bi-monthly vote incentives rewards based on sdTKN voting powers. Currently, the vote incentive rewards are exchanged for either SDT or sdTKN if the peg is below 99%, in accordance with #SDGP 13: Distribute Liquid Locker bribes in sdTOKEN if the pool sdTOKEN:TOKEN peg is below 1:0.99 2. These rewards are then distributed to eligible sdTOKEN-gauge holders.\n\nMotivation:\n\nThe primary motivation behind this proposal is twofold. Firstly, it aims to support the growth of Liquid Lockers’ positions, strengthening the overall position of the project. At current rates, the CRV Liquid Locker will bi-weekly lock an additional 300,000 CRV or 7,000,000 CRV over a year.\n\nSecondly, it intends to maintain the stability of the sdTKN peg. By using vote incentives to buy, using Cowswap solvers routes, sdTKN from the market when it’s more profitable or minting sdTKN when the sdTKN-TKN is at peg, the proposal seeks to balance and stabilize the peg.\n\nIn conclusion, adopting this proposal (SDGP 17) is expected to provide dual benefits of improving the stability of sdTKN’s peg and bolstering Liquid Lockers’ overall position. The utilization of sdTKN for distributing vote incentives rewards presents a promising solution that aligns with the objectives of Stake DAO.\n\nIt also aims at facilitating the process of claiming and distributing vote incentives, to enable its full automation (and in the long term decentralisation).\n\nMeans:\n\nHuman resources: Minimal developer time needed\nTreasury resources: No treasury resources needed\nTechnical Implementation: Use Cowswap solvers buy/mint routes for sdTKN\n\nProposal specifications:\nAdmin: veSDT holders\nCommunity feedback: 2 days minimum\nVoting Duration: 5 days",

Instead, our intent is to closely collaborate by:\n\nIntegrating Stake DAO directly within Convergence (veSDT liquid locker and boosted sdTKN and LP staking);\nUsing heavily the Stake DAO’s infrastructure for our future treasury deployments (sdTKN boosted with veSDT, and LPs).\nConvergence’s treasury will be composed mostly of Curve ecosystem assets. The purpose of our treasury will be to ensure POL, as well as generating as much yield as possible, in order to distribute back 80% of its earning every 3 months to $CVG lockers, in the form of $CRV, $CVX, $FXS and $SDT.\n\nThe basics of the treasury deployments strategy can be found here: https://docs.cvg.finance/bonds-and-treasury/treasury/treasury-strategy\n\nConvergence isn’t live yet. However, prior to launch, our intent is to start to deploy our treasury in order to grow it as much as possible, to give the best possible returns to the ysCVG primitive. Thus, being able to boost our future sdCRV and Curve LPs positions with veSDT is a “must have”, in order to achieve maximum capital efficiency.\n\nImportant: as described in the previous link (basics of treasury deployments), the $SDT farmed via our sdTKN and LPs position will be compounded into SDT/FRAXBP, or SDT/ETH. As mentioned, every 3 months, $SDT will be withdrawn from LPs, and distributed back to ysCVG holders.\n\nMeans:\n\nHuman Resources: Minimal developer time needed.\nTreasury Resources: No treasury resources needed.\n\nTechnical Implementation: Update the SDT smart wallet whitelist.\n\nProposal Specifications:\n\nAdmin: veSDT holders\nCommunity feedback: 2 days minimum\nVoting Duration: 3 days",

      "content": "Summary:\n\nThe proposal is to remove the old sdTKN/TKN curve gauges from the SDT gauge controller in order to redirect SDT incentives towards new strategies.\n\nContext:\n\nCurve Finance has recently deployed a new factory pool for crypto pools, which introduces new features like a built-in oracle price. This development opens up possibilities for implementing additional functionalities within the platform. Stake DAO deployed new Curve pools and gauges for sdTKN liquidity.\n\nWe propose to remove the old sdTKN/TKN Curve gauges from the SDT gauge controller. By doing so, veSDT holders would have the opportunity to redirect SDT incentives towards the utilization of these new strategies and features. This adjustment aligns with the goal of maximizing the benefits and opportunities provided by Curve Finance’s upgraded infrastructure.\n\nMeans:\n\nHuman resources: Minimal developer time needed\nTreasury resources: No treasury resources needed\nTechnical Implementation: Remove old sdTKN/TKN gauges, set weight to 0 for veSDT votes.\n\nProposal specifications:\n\nAdmin: veSDT holders\nCommunity feedback: 2 days minimum\nVoting Duration: 5 days",

Through on-boarding new contributors, rewarding existing builders and empowering dao-level coordination, Llamas becomes the social layer and cultural flywheel of CurveDAO and its counterparts.\nThe Llamas enables an anonymous workforce and coordination marketplace that directs and utilizes an ever-growing, community-owned treasury.\nLlamas wishes to decentralize its treasury via partner grants permanently locked in their native form to further align with curve native protocols.\n\nRationale:\n\nThe Llamas will divest Ether into curve eco assets, primarily partner protocols which will continue to be accumulated. A grant of 100,000 SDT would be matched with an initial purchase of 100,000 sdCRV rising to 500,000 sdCRV to be locked into liquid lockers. Thus enabling llamas a boosted entrance into the Stake Dao ecosystem. This will be an ongoing process as mint fees and royalties are divested further.",

      "content": "**Summary** :\n\nThis proposal aims to rule out Remove stETH gauge from the SDT gauge controller.\n\n**Context**:\n\nSince its introduction, the stETH curve gauge has been receiving rewards from the SDT weekly allocation veSDT votes.\n\n\nAs Stake DAO perf fees are only on CRV tokens for Curve strategies and because the stETH only relies on LIDO rewards to generated yield, Stake DAO does not earn anything out of that strategy.\n\nRemoving stETH gauge from the SDT gauge controller would let veSDT holders to redirect SDT incentives towards strategies aligned with the DAO interets (where the DAO earns performance fees and which are being more profitable to the DAO).\n\nIn the future, if the stETH curve gauge start receiving again some CRV, an onchain vote can be pushed to add the stETH gauge back to the the SDT gauge controller\n\n**Means**:\n\nHuman resources: Minimal developer time needed\n\nTreasury resources: No treasury resources needed\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n\nRemove stETH curve gauge from the SDT gauge controller and set to 0 veSDT votes\n\nProposal specifications:\n\nAdmin: veSDT holders\n\nCommunity feedback: 2 days minimum\n\nVoting Duration: 5 days\n\n",

      "content": "**Summary** :\nThis proposal aims to reduce the quorum for Stake DAO on-chain votes to 10%. \n\n**Rationale**: \n\nStake DAO on-chain governance allows users who hold 2,500 veSDT to propose any Stake DAO strategy to the SDT gauge controller. Users who hold veSDT can then use their voting power to exercise their votes on these user-proposed votes to add SDT rewards to new strategies.\n\nSo far, we have seen votes struggling to reach the 20% quorum, which lead to users not trying anymore to push gauge votes. To ensure a more efficient decentralisation of the protocole, and that the on-chain governance doesn’t represent a blocker for Stake DAO’s development, we propose reducing the current quorum to 10%. \n\n**Means**: Resources needed for this proposal\n**Human resources:** Limited work (passing a transaction to modify quorum)\n\n**Technical implementation:** \nAdmin: veSDT holders\nCommunity feedback: 2 days minimum\nVoting Duration: 5 days\n",

      "content": "**Summary**: \n\nDeploy a BPT liquid locker and associated strategy with a gauge for the sdBPT/BPT LP on Stake DAO\n\n**Context** : \n\nStake DAO is a non-custodial platform built on top of decentralized protocols that enables anyone to easily grow their crypto portfolio. The TVL of the protocol is above 630M$, spread out across chains where the Curve ecosystem is already present. Stake DAO recently released a new feature called the Liquid Lockers that will help accelerate the lock of CRV and other veTokens.\n\nIt’s a new feature built for tokens with ve-model allowing users to keep a liquid position while enjoying some yield and the associated voting power (which can both be boosted with veSDT)\n\n**Rationale**: \n\nStake DAO propose to create a liquid locker for BPT holders, so users could lock their BPT on a liquid locker and receive sdBPT, enjoying all the voting rights of the veBPT, the Liquid locker yield, while keeping a liquid position.\n\nThen, BlackPool DAO will be able to lock their SDT to vote on sdBPT Liquid locker and sdBPT/BPT strategy gauges to receive SDT rewards. Ideally, BlackPool and Stake DAO should aim for at least 1 million in liquidity on the sdBPT/BPT pool. \n\nAlso, BPT holders depositing into liquid lockers will receive sdBPT that can either be staked into a reward contract to receive several sources of yield while keeping the voting power and a liquid position, or deposit them in the associated strategy (sdBPT/BPT LP). Fees on yield would be 5%. \nYou can find more info on this new product in this[ medium post: Introducing Liquid Lockers & veSDT | by Stake DAO | Feb, 2022 | Medium](https://medium.com/@stakedaohq/introducing-liquid-lockers-vesdt-5febcf169170)\n\n***Benefits for Stake DAO:***\n\n* Create a long term position on BlackPool\n* Ability to vote on BPT gauges with veBPT/sdBPT\n* Increase the governance participation and DAO revenues by farming BPT rewards\n* Increase the visibility of both projects with cross marketing\n\n***Benefits for BlackPool DAO:***\n\n* Create a long term position on SD\n* Creation of a Liquid Locker and a sdBPT/BPT strategy both eligible for gauges rewards by locking SDT and voting with veSDT\n* Once live, BPT holders will be able to boost their voting power on sdBPT with their veSDT\n* Increase the visibility of both projects with cross marketing\n\nTechnical implementation: deploy the LL, the associated strategy and the gauge related to the strategy.\n",

      "title": "SDIP #19: Move v2 incentives to the LL strategies gauge controller and kill incentives for Polygon strats",
      "content": "**Summary**:\n\nWe propose including the v2 strategies in the liquid lockers UI, and create gauges for each strategy so that the community can vote on incentives over the full scope of what is offered by the protocol.\n\nWe also suggest killing incentives for the two Polygon strategies.\n\nThis aims to avoid useless inflation and limit manual tasks linked to inflation updates for v2 strategies, hence pushing further the decentralization of the protocol.\n\n**Context**:\n\nAuto-compounded strategies from Stake DAO v2 are still relevant since they offer an automatic compounder of the safest pools for the main assets which are USD and EUR stable coins, ETH and BTC. However, there are currently two conflicting inflation frameworks which would gain from being synchronized. V2 strategies receive a share of v2 inflation proportionate to the revenues generated (except Polygon strats and Frax strats for which it is too complicated to change inflation on a regular basis). On the other hand, Liquid Lockers and their strategies receive inflation as a result of a weekly on-chain vote. There are two votes: one for the lockers, and one for the strategies.\n\nThe idea of this proposal is to include the v2 strategies and NFT incentives inside the LL strategies gauge controller so that the inflation can be managed fully on-chain by the community.\n\nFurthermore, the team has had difficulties maintaining the incentives on the two Polygon strategies, due the fact that it needs a lot of complex manual work (needed notably for calculating, bridging the assets, updating the Polygon Masterchef contract, etc.). Moreover, those two strategies saw their yield shrink significantly during the past months, and are no longer bringing any fees to the DAO. Since the beginning of 2022, the Passive USD Strategy generated $9,410 in performance fees, and the Passive BTC strategy $752. It is much less than the amount of incentives that have been sent to those strategies to keep our Polygon users happy.\n\nIt, therefore, makes sense to cut the incentives towards those strategies that require a lot of manpower and do not generate any more revenues.\n\nThis will also massively increase the decentralization of the protocol and the ability of the team to focus on building high value-add products.\n\n**Proposal**:\n\nThis proposal suggests pursuing the following actions:\n\n1. Kill inflation in the Masterchef for all strategies and for the NFT staking\n2. Set to 0 the reward rates of the Polygon Masterchef\n3. Create a gauge inside the Liquid Locker strategies’ gauge controller for the following strategies:\n\n  * Passive steth strategy\n  * Passive ETH strategy\n  * Passive BTC strategy\n  * Passive EURO strategy\n  * Passive USD strategy\n\n4. Add Frax’s gauges for sdFRAX3CRV and sdETH-fraxput in the Liquid Locker strategies’ gauge controller\n5. Create a new contract for NFT staking and add the corresponding gauge in the Liquid Locker strategies’ gauge controller\n\n*For*:\n\n* Decentralizes further the protocol by reducing off-chain computation and empowering the community\n* Provides value to veSDT as it is now able to also vote on all inflation allocation of the protocol\n* Less manual work for the team which can focus on development\n* Progressive migration of the full stack towards the new UI\n* Reduces risk of error regarding inflation and NFT staking\n* Reduces unproductive inflation\n\n*Against*:\n\n* Users will need to lock and vote to make sure v2 strategies keep receiving incentives\n* Can lead to less attractivity of v2 strategies\n* Will probably lead to lower TVL cross chain\n\n**Means**:\n\nHuman resources: For points 1-4: one day of developer work. For point 5: 3 weeks of developer work.\n\nTreasury resources: No treasury resources are needed\n\nProposal specifications:\n\nAdmin: veSDT holders\n\nCommunity feedback: 2 days minimum\n\nVoting Duration: 8 days",

      "title": "SDGP- 9┃Create a “BRIBES” gauge in the lockers SDT gauge controller",
      "content": "Protocol name: STAKE DAO\n\n**Summary**:\n\nWe propose to create a “BRIBES” gauge in the lockers gauge controller to increase the liquidity of sdTKN/TKN pools, and therefore the voting and revenue boost of lockers.\n\n**Context**:\nsdTKNs currently have limited liquidity (10% of the supply for sdCRV, 20% for sdFXS, 12% for sdANGLE, 8% for sdBAL). This leads to the fact that big investors struggle investing large amounts in the locker, and more importantly, to a reduction of boost for sdTKN stakers. If we want to accelerate our locking rate, we need sdTKN voting power to be attractive, especially for sdCRV and sdBAL where the bribe market is very active. During the community discussion on the sdTKN liquidity program topic (https://gov.stakedao.org/t/sdtkn-liquidity-program/705), we received many feedbacks, notably the fact that taking a fee on bribes to incentivise liquidity would make sdTKN voting power even less attractive. This is probably a good long term solution, but not designed to bootstrap the liquidity in these early days.\n\n**Proposal**:\n\nWe propose including a new gauge in the lockers gauge controller that will accumulate SDT to fund bribing campaigns on sdTKN pools. The bribes would be managed by the core team. This is a solution that has been used by Frax and Angle for their liquidity and seems to be working efficiently.\nTo ensure this is efficient, we also propose increasing inflation towards the lockers gauge controller to 1 SDT per block, and inflation towards strategies to 1.5 SDT per block.\n\n**Means**:\n\nHuman resources: Minimal developer time needed\n\nTreasury resources: No treasury resources needed\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n\nCreate a “BRIBES” gauge in the lockers SDT gauge controller and adjust inflation.\n\n**Proposal specifications:**\n\nAdmin: veSDT holders\n\nCommunity feedback: 2 days minimum\n\nVoting Duration: 5 days\n",

To maximize the utility of the lockers and boost their sdCRV voting power, while keeping the security of a multisig, TempleDAO requires whitelisted access to lock SDT tokens.\n\nThis will also allow them to re-stake CRV rewards into sdCRV, allowing them to further grow their sdCRV position and increase their voting power on Curve gauges directly from the Liquid Lockers platform.\n\nTempleDAO is an important player in the FXS bribes market, whitelisting them to lock SDT for veSDT will also allow them to build a profitable sdFXS position in the future.\n\n**Means**:\n\nHuman resources: Minimal developer time needed.\n\nTreasury resources: No treasury resources needed.\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\n\nUpdate the SDT smart wallet whitelist.\n\n**Proposal specifications:**\n\nAdmin: veSDT holders\n\nCommunity feedback: 2 days minimum\n\nVoting Duration: 3 days",

      "content": "**Summary**: \nThis proposal aims to create emergency daos for Balancer sdBAL/B-80BAL-20WETH Liquid Lockers.\n\n**Context** :\nStake DAO has been whitelisted to allow the protocol to lock B-80BAL-20WETH, and create a Balancer Liquid Lockers.\n\nFrom now on, thanks to the Balancer Liquid Lockers, sdBAL holders can take part in the governance of Balancer and benefit from the advantages offered by the proctocol.\n\nHowever, despite the advantages of the products, some risks were highlighted by the DeFi communities. The major risk raised concerns the manipulation of votes by governance attacks via the metagovernance that the Liquid Lockers offer.\n\n**Rationale**:\nIn order to answer the many questions raised by the users, and to reduce the risks as much as possible, Stake DAO has put in place various means to prevent these dangers\n\namong others, the veSDT veto right, the time weighted average voting power mechanism, and the creation of a Balancer Emergency DAO. Seen as an additional means of guarding against malicious voting, the Emergency DAO will be a further bulwark against malicious or suspicious voting. A malicious voting can be defined as « any governance vote putting at risk the underlying protocol ».\n\nIndeed, it has been agreed with the different actors of Stake DAO and Balancer to create an Emergency DAO able to close any vote that would seem malicious and not take it into account in the final result.\n\nThe [Emergency DAO ](https://dao.curve.fi/emergencymembers)is an idea pioneered by Curve that empowers a small group to “kill” pools and gauges in the event of malicious activity and/or potential loss of funds.\n\nEach of the liquid lockers has their own Emergency DAO. This emergency DAO is composed of 2 members from the underlying protocols, 2 members from Stake DAO, and 2 independent members from the ecosystem, agreed upon by the 4 other members. An emergency DAO vote would require at least 4 votes to pass, Each member has one vote. Any member may propose a vote. All members of the emergency DAO may underline a mischievous vote.\n\n**Members**:\n* Hubert_Tube (Stake DAO)\n* chago0x (Stake DAO)\n* Solarcurve (Balancer team)\n* Zen Dragon (Balancer team)\n* Pablo from Angle (independant selected by stake DAO)\n* Kia (independant selected by Balancer)\n\n**Voting options:** \n[poll type=regular results=always chartType=bar]\n* Yes, create Balancer Emergency DAO\n* No, don't create Balancer Emergency DAO\n* Abstain\n[/poll]",

The FXS Liquid Locker was one of the first Lockers to be deployed.

      "title": "SDIP#17: Create Emergency DAOs for sdAngle/Angle, sdFXS/FXS and sdCRV/CRV Liquid Lockers",
      "content": "**Summary**: \nThis proposal aims to create emergency DAOs for the sdAngle/Angle, sdFXS/FXS and sdCRV/CRV Liquid Lockers.\n\n**Context** :\nThis proposal follows the discussion that took place when a proposal was published on Curve to add sdToken/Token pools to the Curve gauge controller, ie: sdAngle/Angle, sdFXS/FXS and sdCRV/CRV pools.\n\nThe aim for Stake DAO was to create all these gauges as part of its new product: The Liquid Lockers.\n\nHowever, some potential risks were highlighted by the various stakeholders, including Convex, Curve and Angle and their communities. The main concerns were regarding the manipulation of votes, leading to possible governance attacks via the metagovernance offered by the Liquid Lockers.\n\n**Rationale**:\n\nIn order to address the community's concerns, and to reduce all risks as much as possible, Stake DAO has put in place various preventative measures.\n\nThese measures include, among others, the veSDT veto right, the time weighted average voting power mechanism, and the creation of an Emergency DAO. Presented as an additional means of guarding against malicious voting, the emergency DAO will be a further bulwark against malicious or suspicious voting. A malicious vote can be defined as « any governance vote which puts the underlying protocol at risk ».\n\nTherefore, Stake DAO has agreed with Frax, Angle, Curve and Convex to create an Emergency DAO, which will be able to close any vote that seems malicious and disregard the final result.\n\nThe idea of the [Emergency DAO ](https://dao.curve.fi/emergencymembers)was pioneered by Curve, serving to empower a small trusted group to “kill” pools and gauges in the event of malicious activity and/or potential loss of funds.\n\nIn this case, it will be used to veto any suspicious votes in the three Liquid Lockers ie. sdAngle/Angle, sdFXS/FXS and sdCRV/CRV. It should also be noted that, in the medium term, as with Curve, the Emergency DAO will have the power to kill a gauge if necessary.\n\nEach of the Liquid Lockers will have their own Emergency DAO. This Emergency DAO will comprise of two members from each of the underlying protocols; two members from Stake DAO, and two independent members from the ecosystem, to be chosen by the four other members. An emergency DAO vote would require at least four votes to pass, each member has one vote. Any member may propose a vote. All members of the emergency DAO are entitled to raise their concerns if they deem a vote to be malicious.\n\n*Curve Liquid Locker Emergency Dao will be composed of* :\n- Mich (Curve)\n- PilotVietnam (Curve)\n- Julien (Stake DAO)\n- Q (Stake DAO)\n- C2Tp (Convex)\n- Sam (Frax)\n\n*Angle Liquid Locker Emergency Dao will be composed of:*\n- Julien (Stake DAO)\n- Hubert (Stake DAO)\n- Pablo (Angle)\n- Picodes (Angle)\n- YK\n- Seraphim (Euler Finance)\n\n*Frax Liquid Locker Emergency Dao will be composed of:*\n- Julien (Stake DAO)\n- Hubert (Stake DAO)\n- Sam (Frax)\n- Travis (Frax)\n- YK\n- C2Tp (Convex)\n",

After the market making engagement GSR will either return the full token loan amount or the USDT amount determined on the basis of (i) the USDT price of SDT or or around the date of the market-making agreement (the “Agreement”) plus (ii) a premium. The token loan will be executed in tranches of 250,000 SDT tokens per month over 6 months.*\n* Subject to the terms of the Agreement, GSR will agree to maintain inventory and liquidity in SDT tokens across major exchanges to provide liquidity to SDT.*\n\n**GSR basic background**\n\nGSR is a market maker founded in 2013, and has since built a proprietary trading system, often trading $3 - $5bn a day across the cryptocurrency ecosystem. GSR’s trading platform is connected to over 60 cryptocurrency exchanges and is integrated with major DEXs and lending protocols. GSR employs over 280 people, predominantly engineers and traders, and has collected nine years of market data that it has used to continuously develop and refine its trading engines and programmatic execution capabilities.\n\n**GSR Defi and Stake DAO specific background**\n\nGSR has become a core provider of liquidity to DeFi projects and decentralized exchanges in the last 24 months. As a prominent actor in this ecosystem, GSR has focused its considerable expertise on growing its capabilities in this area. GSR has provided, at times, over US$1bn of liquidity a day to DeFi markets. By the end of 2022, GSR expects to have invested in excess of US$120 million in crypto projects, the majority being within the DeFi sector, as well as having $1bn in TVL across a wide range of protocols, platforms and projects. GSR has built well-established trading relationships in the DeFi ecosystem with top-tier partners across various verticals.\n\nSpecifically, with respect to SDT, GSR GSR will, subject to the finalization of applicable agreements:\n\nProvide liquid markets for SDT across centralized exchanges*\nActively support SDT trading on exchanges for over one year\nFund the other side of each cross with its own capital. If an exchange requires GBP, Euro, BTC, USDC, etc. to settle a trade, GSR will be able to provide it.\nProvide OTC services for large SDT trades offering best execution\n*comprising of: Bittrex, Coinbase, KuCoin and any additional exchange listings",

      "content": "**Summary**:\n\nProposal to whitelist the Stake DAO multisig on Stake DAO.\n\n**Context**:\n\nSince the launch of liquid lockers, Stake DAO’s voting power has been handed back to users, and with the current bribing environment, the DAO didn’t manage to retain its votes for its different pairs (sdt/eth, sdTKN/TKN, etc).\n\nThe DAO itself owns a lot of CRV that are either locked through the CRV locker or staked in the sdCRV/CRV pool.\n\nUntil now, the sdCRV were not staked to allow the users to have an even greater yield and voting power, but since we need to maintain the yield in our pools, we recently staked our sdCRV. The DAO now benefits from unboosted voting power which it uses to incentivise its liquidity pairs.\n\n**Rationale**:\n\nTo start getting back some yield to our different pools in a more efficient manner, it is relevant to allow the DAO to lock SDT and boost its voting power.\n\nThis proposal aims to whitelist the Stake DAO Gnosis Safe multisig: (0xF930EBBd05eF8b25B1797b9b2109DDC9B0d43063) to interact with veSDT contract.\n\nThis whitelisting will have several advantages for the protocol:\n\n1. Allow voting on Curve and Frax for pools in the best interest of the DAO;\n2. Potential protection against hypothetical governance attacks. The multisig will not normally vote on governance proposals, but having this possibility can be a good security protection in extreme cases;\n3. Possibility to vote on Stake DAO gauge votes in the best interest of the DAO.\n\n**Technical implementation:**\n\nWhitelist Stake DAO multisig address: 0xF930EBBd05eF8b25B1797b9b2109DDC9B0d43063\n\non the following contract:\n\n0x37E8386602d9EBEa2c56dd11d8E142290595f1b5\n",

      "title": "SDIP#1 Define more precise guidelines for Liquid Lockers’ Metagovernance",
      "content": "**Summary**: \nThe discourse following the launch of Stake DAO Liquid Lockers has sourced feedback from essential constituents of the Curve ecosystem to enhance system robustness and ecosystem safety. (source).\n\nAs a result, this proposal suggests implementing a series of contingency measures to take into account this feedback and maximize governance security of underlying protocols:\nLong term interest required: we will put together a TWAVP (time-weighted average voting power) mechanism to ensure a user cannot simply buy, vote, then sell;\nEmergency DAO: each locker will have an emergency DAO with the possibility to cancel a vote seen as malicious;\nveSDT veto: veSDT holders will be able to cancel a malicious vote through an accelerated voting process.\n\n**Context/implementation**:\nIn the Forum discussion, our Convex friends identified a few risks for Curve’s governance: users could maliciously use sdCRV to vote on Curve while retaining no long term interest in the ecosystem. While the risk of flashloan governance attack is nil thanks to the fact that we are using the same block as the one from the proposal, there is still a possibility that users buy sdTOKEN, vote and sell after the vote, even though it would be a risky and costly operation. It’s to avoid this kind of risk that Curve’s locking mechanism was put in place.\nMichwill best describes the problem statement on the Curve Forum. \n\n“The concern is misaligned (short-term) incentives: imagine a decision which can allow to take a short-term profit (like, “turn CRV into a ponzi”), take profit and leave when it maxes out (in a couple of months). This is why veCRV has 4 years lock time in the first place.”\nMost of these concerns are nullified for Curve due to the supply of veCRV relative to liquid CRV, and veSDT, which boosts liquid locker voting power, has a multi-year lockup exactly like veCRV.\nOther solutions such as “vote-locking” did not protect against events like Mochi, Bean, et cetera. (though it has the veto kind of mitigation).\n\nWorking with Curve’s gauge security committee, Angle, Frax, and Convex’s core team, we came up with three security features which should protect Curve’s governance efficiently in case of a governance attack.\n\n\n- **Using a time-weighted average voting power (TWAVP)** :\n\nUsing a TWAVP over one month to ensure that users will have a certain degree of alignment with the underlying protocol over time. This is mainly to avoid governance attacks where a user would buy a lot of sdTKN, vote for it, and sell a few hours or days later. It will work in such a way that new sdTKN holders will see their voting power linearly ramp up over the course of their first month of holding. The formula for voting power will still be the following one:\n\n![Capture d’écran 2022-05-09 à 19.58.00.jpg](ipfs://QmdRKhiaKLTnc2k3i7SuB4BbMRoFyDZ9cHHnRUrgZDtPFH)\n\nBut the user balance (bu) will be replaced by the average user balance over the course of the past month.\n\n\n- **veSDT veto right**:\n\nTo further make sure there is a long term alignment between sdTKN users and the underlying protocols, the votes will be secured by veSDT holders (which by nature have long term alignment with Stake DAO and therefore with the underlying protocols, due to their lock). This means that any veSDT holder will have the possibility to issue a veto vote on Stake DAO’s governance. This veto vote will have a timeline aligned on the one of the proposal in question. veSDT holders will have the possibility to vote for deeming one vote as “malicious”. If such a vote passes, the results will be calculated, not taking into account the vote deemed “malicious”. It goes without saying, this veto power should not be used to change the result of a vote, but purely to eliminate truly malicious governance attacks. This will be only effective for governance votes.\n\n\n- **sdTKN Emergency DAO**:\n\nIn last resort, and as tracking potential governance threats requires a strong involvement and attention, the veSDT veto will be completed by an Emergency DAO for each locker. This emergency DAO will be comprised of 2 members from the underlying protocols, 2 members from Stake DAO, and 2 independent members from the ecosystem, agreed upon by the 4 other members. An emergency DAO vote would require at least 4 votes to pass. It would have the same powers as veSDT veto, i.e. the possibility of declaring a vote “malicious”, and not take it into account in the final result. Again, it works only for governance votes. If we won’t to extend the power of the emergency DAO or veSDT veto, another governance vote will be required.\n\n*Admin: Team multisig\nProposal specifications: \n8 days voting duration\nQuorum: 100,000 SDT*",

      "title": "SDGP#3 Token Swap: Stake DAO x Alchemix",
      "content": "**Summary**:\nExpand the partnership between Alchemix DAO and Stake DAO by performing a 500K $SDT treasury swap of SDT for ALCX which will be used to increase the synergies between both protocols\n\n**Context**:\nAlchemix is a DeFi protocol that allows for the creation of synthetic tokens that represent the future yield of a deposit. It enables users to retrieve near instant tokenized value against temporary deposits of stablecoins.\n\nAlchemix has been an old friend of Stake DAO. Alchemix has supported the SDT/ETH gauge vote on Convex, and has been the first DAO to see the value of our Liquid Lockers.\n\nTo use the liquid lockers, Alchemix needs to lock 1,000,000 SDT, but due to the low liquidity in the market, it was really difficult to achieve. We suggested that they could buy 500k SDT from the market and that we could ask the community’s approval to allow another 500k as an SDT/ALCX token swap. With this 1,000,000 SDT, Alchemix is planning to lock a large amount of CRV through our sdCRV locker.\n\nThe governance token of the protocol is the ALCX, which works with a staking model that allows stakers to vote on:\n\n* Protocol parameters\n* Funding\n* Feature Request\n* Matters of the DAO\n\n**Rationale**:\nWe’d like to propose a token swap of 500K SDT against the same value in ALCX between both DAOs.\n\nBy expanding the partnership between both DAOs with a treasury swap, we can make sure that each project will be able to participate actively in each other’s governance.\n\nIt will also help bootstrap our Liquid Locker activity significantly and potentially lead to bribe revenues for sdCRV holders.\n\n**Benefits**:\n\nFor Stake DAO:\n* Create a long term position on Alchemix\n* Increase the governance participation and DAO revenues by staking $ALCX\n* Increase the visibility of both projects with cross marketing\n* Increase the size of our CRV locker to get closer to critical size\n\nFor Alchemix DAO:\n* Create a long term position on Stake DAO\n* By locking SDT for veSDT, Alchemix will be able to boost the voting of sdCRV, sdFXS or sdANGLE that they have staked\n* Increase the visibility of both projects with cross marketing\n* Increase of the TVL and revenues with Stake DAO treasury deposits (if accepted by the SD vote)\n* Alchemix has already bought 500k $SDT, performing a token swap would allow them to acquire a position on $SDT more easily\n\n**Means**:\nThe token swap will require simultaneous token transfers between Alchemix and Stake DAO for a total amount of 500k $SDT.\n\n**Technical implementation**:\nTo perform the token swap, both daos will need to send tokens to the other dao by using their Gnosis Safe.\n",

      "title": "SDIR#2: Whitelist Alchemix to lock $SDT",
      "content": "**Summary:**\nWe propose to whitelist Alchemix on Stake DAO to allow them to lock SDT and vote with veSDT.\n\n**Rationale:**\nAlchemix has been an old friend of Stake DAO. Alchemix has supported the SDT/ETH pool for Stake DAO, and continues to support Stake DAO in the early days of our Liquid Lockers by providing advice and being the first DAO willing to build on top of our CRV locker.. \n\nThe bonds between Alchemix and Stake DAO are now extremely strong, and it can only be good to strengthen them further. Today, Alchemix would like to lock their SDT on Stake DAO to be able to boost their voting power and vote for their pool on Curve. Furthermore, they are studying the possibility of creating a liquid representation of veSDT (alSDT for example).\n\nWhat Alchemix is trying to achieve is exactly what we have designed those lockers for. Therefore, it sounds natural to grant one whitelisted address to Alchemix.\nNB: if this proposal passes, we will first whitelist Alchemix’s multisig, but if they want to change their whitelist for another contract (e.g. an alSDT contract), we could move the whitelist to this new contract.\n\nFinally, to bootstrap their activities in our locker, they target to hold $1m SDT. They offered to buy 500k from the market and do a token swap for the remaining 500k. We therefore complete this proposal by the following one, for the purpose of this token swap, see SDGP#3\n\n**Means:**\nHuman resources: hardly any dev. time needed to make this possible\nTreasury resources: No treasury resources needed\n\n**Technical Implementation:**\nUpdate the SDT smart wallet whitelist",

      "content": "Stake DAO keep growing on all fronts: TVL, number of verticals, contributor head count\nOperational costs are steadily increasing. This is a good problem to have, as a barometer of our success, but it means we will need to stay organized, strategic, and transparent in our spending.\n\nThis proposal outlines in detail the estimated DAO costs for Q2 2022. Going forward, we will publish these expense reports on a regular basis as we push to develop best-in-class operational practices.\n\n**Summary:**\nSend funds from the Treasury Multisig to pay for the DAO expenses for April/May/June : Infrastructure, Legal & Tax, Events, Admin & Tooling, Marketing and Contributor rewards.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThis proposal seeks approval for the DAO expenses for Q2 2022.\n\n**Mainnet expenses:**\n\n**IT & Tech Infrastructure:**\nAll IT & Tech infrastructure will be provided as a service by an external partner focused on Administration and maintaining. As expected last month, and because of a higher validators amount to bootstrap our Staking-as-a-Service Offering and our Arbitrage Strategies on Avalanche, the budget required for the next quarter has increased, from now, for this expense the budget is 312,000 USDC/quarter.\n\nE.g: AWS, Vercel, Github, and other tools and services needed by the DAO.\n\nServers infrastructure estimated cost: 104,000 USDC/month\nAdmin & Tooling costs: 14,200 USDC/month\nReserve (10%): 11,800 USDC/month\nTotal IT & Infrastructure Q2 budget: 390,000 USDC\n\n**Events:**\nAs the DAO competes against other significant players, events are needed to raise awareness and improve our market presence. For the events, the estimated expense is 78,000 USDC/quarter.\n\nEvents estimated cost : 26,000 USDC/ month\nReserve (10%): 2,600 USDC/ month\nTotal events Q2 budget: 85,800 USDC\n\n**Marketing:**\nIn order to improve the marketing around Stake DAO and the liquid lockers,the marketing and communication budget is increased to 30,000/Quarter.\n\nMarketing estimated cost: 10,000 USDC/month\nCommunication estimated cost (audio/video/PR): 2600 UDC/month\nReserve (10%) :1260 USDC/month\nTotal marketing and communication Q2 budget: 41,580 USDC\n\n**Audits:**\nThe audit costs are estimated to 60,000 USDC/quarter, however the cost can change depending on the complexity:\n\nAudits estimated cost: 58,500 USDC to pay in April\nReserve (10%): 5,850 USDC\nTotal audits Q2 budget : 64;350 USDC\n\n**Polygon expenses:**\n\n**Contributors rewards:**\nThe rewards are estimated to 159,675 sdam3CRV/quarter for the DAO contributions:\n\nContributors rewards estimated: 53,225 sdam3CRV/month\nReserve in case of new hires (up to + 25%): .13,300 sdam3CRV/month\nTotal contributors Q2 budget: 199,600 sdam3CRV.\n\nTotal DAO estimated cost for Q2 2022: 688,649 USDC\n\nReserve for Q2 2022: 92,800 USDC\n\nThe reserve should be kept in USDC on Aave in case there’s a need for it.\n\n**Means:**\n529K USDC + 160K sdam3CRV\n\n**Technical implementation:**\nNone\n\n**Voting options:**\nYes, accept DAO expenses\nNo, refuse DAO expenses\nAbstain\n\n![image](ipfs://QmW1QQWC3jQPmjjjgxrchaFzAhQUZmwFjQQZiARmchweBg)",

      "content": "**Forum post:** https://gov.stakedao.org/t/sdip-15-new-governance-framework/606\n\n**Summary:**\nThis post aims to define a framework for the Stake DAO governance by defining several types of proposals depending on the subject discussed, voting on DAO rules, and creating templates that should be helpful for everyone trying to participate.\n\nPosting a proposal on the governance forum and discussing it there and on discord first allows us to get a sentiment check and valuable feedback about the community’s ideas and upcoming Snapshot votes.\n\n**Rationale:**\n**I) Information required for every type of proposal:**\nGovernance forum post: Each proposal should be posted on the governance forum for at least 48 hours before posting the snapshot, which allows the community to give some feedback, propose changes, and vote on a community sentiment poll.\n\n**Number, Name, type and description of the proposal:** Each proposal must be easily identifiable and correctly classified.\n**Name:** The name must be the same on the forum post and snapshot (Max 10 words)\n**Number:** Each proposal must have a number representing the post order on the forum and snapshot\n**Types and description:** SDIR - SDGP - SDIP. These are discussed in detail below.\n**Summary:** Short description of the proposal (1-2 sentences max)\n\n**Rationale:** Detailed explanation of the proposal and milestones for its execution.\n\n**Means:** Resources needed for this proposal\n- Human resources: Special skills required if any (dev or others)\n- Treasury resources: Proposal cost (in SDT/stables), % of the treasury required\n**Technical implementation:** Highlight the technical implementations of this proposal if any\n**Timeline and Roadmap:** Include a suggested roadmap and immediate next steps required for a minimum viable project.\n\n**Voting options:** Mention the options that will be included on the snapshot vote, including an “Abstain” one.\n\n**II) Different proposals categories:**\nI suggest 3 types of proposals:\n\n*Stake DAO Integration Request (SDIR):*\nDescription: Proposal to add a new protocol to Stake DAO, either on liquid lockers, or passive strategies. This type of proposal should include, in addition to all the points mentioned in the first part:\nProject Presentation: (After summary)\nProtocol name\nAudit(s) links\nSupported chain(s): Ethereum / Polygon / etc\nTwitter/Discord/Telegram links\n\nProject metrics: (After project presentation)\nCurrent protocol TVL\nDaily volume\nCommunity size on Twitter/Discord/Telegram\nEstimated extra yield for $veSDT holders thanks to this proposal if any\n\nConsidering that the integration proposals can happen quite often, and that the risk for the protocol is lower than other proposal types, we could consider the following parameters:\n\n**Proposal specifications:**\nAdmin: veSDT holders\nCommunity feedback: 2 days min\nVoting duration: 3 days\nQuorum: As we’re still in the migration phase to veSDT, each quorum will be voted on later.\n\n*Stake DAO Governance Proposal (SDGP):*\nDescription: SDGPs are about common governance proposals, especially the ones related to the treasury of the protocol and the DAO organization.\nThis type of proposal should include, in addition to all the points mentioned in the first part:\n\n**Context:** (After summary)\nComprehensive overview of the proposal,treasury breakdown if needed.\n\nThe SDGPs would concern but wouldn’t be limited to:\n- Quarterly budgets\n- Liquidity mining gauge votes\n- Grant program if any\n- Contributors/Dao Committees rewards\n- Long term partnerships (i.e Dao Swaps)\n- DAO expenses\n\n**Proposal specifications:**\nAdmin(s): Team multisig\nCommunity feedback: 2 days min\nVoting duration: 5 days\nQuorum: As we’re still in the migration phase to veSDT, each quorum will be voted on later.\n\n*Stake DAO Improvement Protocol (SDIP):*\nDescription: SDIPs are about the most important modifications either on the governance framework or on the protocol directly.\nThis type of proposal should include, in addition to all the points mentioned in the first part:\nContext: What’s the modification and why it’s needed.\n\nThe SDIPs would concern but wouldn’t be limited to:\n- New version of the protocol\n- Smart contract modification\n- Updates on the initial parameters\n- Governance framework modification\n- Add/Remove a signer on the treasury multisig\n- Modification of the protocol fees distribution\n\nSDIPs are the most critical and important types of proposals, as it’s directly about the core product of Stake DAO or a major change in the functioning of governance.\nIt’s very important to get as many community members aware of this kind of proposal for them to vote accordingly, which is why we should consider more conservative parameters, and a longer voting period:\n\n**Proposal specifications:**\nAdmin: Team multisig\nCommunity feedback: 2 days min\nVoting duration: 8 days\nQuorum: As we’re still in the migration phase, each quorum will be voted on later.\n\nEach type will be detailed in a template for each category on the forum.\n\n**Treasury allocations:**\nThe treasury allocations will be shared in a category called \"Treasury Management”\nThis category will includes monthly reports about the treasury actions taken, suggestion channels and soft community polls to consider new strategies proposed.\n\n**Voting options:**\nYes, accept the governance framework\nNo, refuse the governance framework\nAbstain",

      "content": "Forum post: https://gov.stakedao.org/t/sdip-14-proposal-to-launch-stakedao-on-celo/602\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Celo community is proposing to deploy StakeDAO on the Celo Blockchain. This expansion to Celo will enable StakeDAO to broaden its reach into a new DeFi ecosystem with $3M of additional incentives for StakeDAO users.\n\nMotivation:\n\nStakeDAO is building the multi-chain future of DeFi. The Celo ecosystem presents a strong partnership due to its global user base, native stablecoin assets, and EVM compatibility. Current multichain DeFi protocols on Celo include Sushi, 0x, Beefy and PoolTogether, which are joined by native protocols such as Moola Market, Ubeswap, and Mobius.\n\nSpecification:\n\nOur proposal is to support the StakeDAO community and expansion in a multi-chain world. Celo is a carbon negative mobile-first platform that makes financial dApps and crypto payments accessible to anyone with a mobile phone. Bringing StakeDAO to Celo means enabling millions of people to gain access to more DeFi tools, and helps further Celo’s goal of bringing prosperity to all.\n\nThrough the $100M DeFi for the People initiative, the Celo Foundation will provide $3M of incentives in CELO tokens to bring sustainable liquidity to StakeDAO. Stablecoins on Celo will be listed on StakeDAO to provide opportunities for SDT holders to earn trading fees. Additionally, we propose that the StakeDAO community also provides SDT tokens as incentives.\n\nCelo features 2.6M addresses, up to 1.1M daily transactions, and has processed 102M total transactions. Current native stablecoins include cUSD, cEUR, and cREAL backed by the Celo Reserve. Additionally, Celo has been chosen by Kickstarter for its upcoming decentralized product (Kickstarter has successfully supported over 214,000 projects with over $6B in funding and 20M backers).\n\ncLabs will work with the StakeDAO team to deploy all necessary smart contracts needed to start StakeDAO pools and provide any additional tooling necessary to manage incentives for the StakeDAO community, as well as work with third party vendors to perform smart contract audits. cLabs will also work to ensure that cross chain bridge options are available for swapping SDT tokens to and from Celo to networks where StakeDAO is present. Celo is EVM compatible and so the deployment is expected to be completed with little to no alterations to the smart contracts.\n\nReferences:\n\nCelo homepage: https://celo.org\nDeFi for the People: https://www.defiforthepeople.org\nDocumentation: https://docs.celo.org\nCelo Whitepaper & Stability Protocol: https://celo.org/papers\nSource code: https://github.com/celo-org\n\nMetrics:\n\n110 individual validators organized in 68 validator groups staking 315M CELO. All validator nodes are community run. The Celo Foundation does not operate and has never operated any nodes on the network.\n\nOver 2,300 participants from 135 countries in the Make Crypto Mobile hackathon, 2.6M addresses, up to 1.1M daily transaction, and 102M total transactions.\n\n$541M reserve holdings: 3.3K BTC; 35.0K ETH; 15.4M Dai; 83.3K cMCO2.\n\n2,942 tons of CO2 offset.\n\nCommunity: Twitter https://twitter.com/celoorg (168K), Discord https://chat.celo.org (16K)\n\nFor:\n\nStakeDAO will add new users from the Celo community and enable millions of people to gain access to DeFi tools through their mobile phone.\nPromote Celo’s goal of bringing DeFi to everyday people by driving more liquidity into the Celo ecosystem thereby making DeFi more accessible.\n\nAgainst:\n\nNot enough interest in the StakeDAO community to deploy and maintain on Celo.\nCelo’s goal for making DeFi to people through mobile phones does not fit within StakeDAO’s goals.\n\n",

      "content": "**Forum post:** https://gov.stakedao.org/t/sdip-13-d2d-swap-stake-dao-x-apwine/592\n\n**Summary:**\nExpand the partnership between APWine DAO and Stake DAO by performing a 500K$ treasury swap of SDT for APW which will be used to increase the synergies between both protocols\n\n**Context:**\nApwine is a yield tokenizing protocol allowing users to long or short their yield, which can create arbitrage opportunities. The protocol works with two tokens : PT (Principal token) and FYT (Future Yield Token). The PT represents the underlying token locked for a 90 days period and the FYT represents the yield on the period, which can be sold in advance.\n\nThe governance token of the protocol is APW, which works with a ve-model,and is used to incentivize the liquidity pools and to vote on the governance proposals. In the coming weeks, the DAO will vote to enable gauges for APW rewards.\n\nSeveral Stake DAO pools have already been added to the winelisting events, and voted to be eligible to APW rewards:\n\n- Winelisting 1 - Mainnet: xSDT\nSnapshot vote: https://snapshot.org/#/apwine.eth/proposal/0x5ab0a6df91ab2921437b0c3ec842ea199e884059a328f69203c6ad8b6eb36181\n- Winelisting 2 - Mainnet: sdFRAX3CRV-f\nSnapshot vote: https://snapshot.org/#/apwine.eth/proposal/0x4b919c1b2789c124f6182935d0059842a529b47c11a4dcf259e521792b14c9e3\n- Winelisting 2 - Polygon: sdam3CRV\nSnapshot vote: https://snapshot.org/#/apwine.eth/proposal/0xe34746688787d0b88441c4b5aa619037098a070ace41f30907ac5a1f77737c68\n\nBy expanding the partnership between both DAOs with a treasury swap, we can make sure that each project will be able to participate actively in the other’s governance.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThis proposal will have 3 different topics:\n\n**Token swap:**\nWe’d like to propose a token swap of 500K$ worth between both DAOs. \nThe proposed token swap conditions are:\n\n- Split the swap with 50K$ tranches during 10 weeks\n- The swap price will be determined with a 3 Day TWAP before each swap\n- Both DAOs should lock at least the 1st tranche, and can wait the liquid lockers for the next ones\n- The tokens received will be used for gauge voting ang governance purposes\n\n**APW Liquid locker and strategy creation:**\nStake DAO propose to create a liquid locker for APWine, so users could lock their APW on a liquid locker and receive sdAPW, enjoying all the voting rights of the veAPW, the Liquid locker yield, while keeping a liquid position.\n\nApwine DAO will be able to lock their SDT to vote on sdAPW Liquid locker and sdAPW/APW strategy gauges to receive SDT rewards.\n\n**Stake DAO treasury allocation:**\nConsidering that $APW rewards will now be allocated with gauges, another good option could be to increase SD $APW holdings by allocating part of the Stake DAO treasury on APWine pools, starting with FRAX3CRV-f and sdam3CRV PT/Underlying pools.\n\nThe treasury currently holds around 2M$ in stablecoins including 300K$ in FRAX3CRV and 100K$ in 3CRV. I suggest allocating 15% of the total stablecoins (200K$ to the PT/FRAX3CRV pool and 100K$ to the PT/sdam3CRV pool).\n\nStake DAO will then be able to vote on FRAX3CRV and sdam3CRV gauges to boost the rewards for the treasury.\n\n**Benefits for Stake DAO:**\nCreate a long term position on APW\nAbility to vote on APW gauges with veAPW/sdAPW\nIncrease the governance participation and DAO revenues by farming APW rewards\nsdTokens can be integrated as IBTs on APWine once live\nIncrease the visibility of both projects with cross marketing\n\n**Benefits for APWine DAO:**\nCreate a long term position on SDT\nCreation of a Liquid Locker and a sdAPW/APW strategy both eligible for gauges rewards by locking SDT and voting with veSDT\nOnce live, APW holders will be able to boost their voting power on sdAPW with their veSDT\nOnce live, new IBTs that can be integrated on the protocol (sdTokens)\nIncrease the visibility of both projects with cross marketing\nIncrease of the TVL and revenues with Stake DAO treasury deposits (if accepted by the SD vote)\n\n**Means:**\nSwap the tokens every week over 2.5 months\n\n**Technical implementation:**\n- The swap price will be determined with a 3 Day TWAP before each swap\n- Create a liquid locker and a strategy for the veAPW\n\n**Voting options:**\nYes, token swap + the liquid locker (LL) & strategy + Treasury allocation\nYes, token swap + the liquid locker (LL) & strategy\nYes, token swap only\nNo, against the token swap\nAbstain",

      "content": "With Stake DAO growing on all fronts — TVL, number of verticals, contributor head count—operational costs are steadily increasing. This is a good problem to have, as a barometer of our success, but it means we will need to stay organized, strategic, and transparent in our spending.\n\nThis proposal outlines in detail the costs incurred by the DAO in March, 2022, and seeks approval. Going forward, we will publish these expense reports on a regular basis as we push to develop best-in-class operational practices.\n\n**Forum post:** https://gov.stakedao.org/t/sdip-12-dao-expenses-for-march-2022/590\n\n**Summary:**\nSend funds from the Treasury Multisig to the Operational Multisig and Polygon Multisig to pay for the DAO expenses for March : Infrastructure, Legal & Tax, Events, Admin & Tooling, Marketing and Contributor rewards.\n\n**Rationale:**\nThe goal of this proposal is to bring more transparency to the Stake DAO Treasury. A governance framework is already in work (and should be ready next month), which should facilitate better visibility of the governance, and present a monthly budget for the DAO costs. This proposal seeks approval for the DAO expenses for March 2022.\n\n**Mainnet expenses:**\n\n**IT & Tech Infrastructure:**\nAll IT & Tech infrastructure will be provided as a service by an external partner focused on Administration and maintaining. The initial budget for this expense was 45,000 USDC/quarter, however the cost increased a lot and the servers costs are expected to increase over the next months, because of a higher validators amount to bootstrap our Staking-as-a-Service Offering and our Arbitrage Strategies on Avalanche.\n\nAWS, Vercel, Github, and other tools and services needed by the DAO.\nServers infrastructure: 60,000 USDC\nAdmin & Tooling: 7,900 + 5,800 USDC\nTotal monthly costs: 73,700 USDC\n\n**Legal & Tax:**\nAs regulation and AML rules are getting tighter, the DAO must have a solid legal base on which operations take part. The DAO will continue to mandate an experienced advisory already working with major projects on the blockchain. The initial budget for this cost was 20,000 USDC/quarter.\n\nEffective Cost for the Legal & Tax expense: 5,500 USDC\nExtra budget in case of additional costs: 1,200 USDC\nTotal monthly cost: 6,700 USDC\n\n**Marketing & Events:**\nAs the DAO competes against other significant players, marketing actions like events are needed to raise awareness of DAO and improve our market presence. The initial budget for events was 20,000 USDC/quarter, depending on the amount of events and the marketing one was 60,000 USDC/quarter.\n\nEffective cost for March events: 47,000 USDC\nExtra budget in case of additional cost: 3,000 USDC\nMarketing costs: 20,000 USDC\nTotal monthly cost: 70,000 USDC\n\n**Audits:**\nThe audit costs are estimated to 60,000 USDC/quarter, however the cost can change depending on the complexity:\n\nEffective Audits costs to pay for Q1 2022: 56,250 USDC\nAudit already paid for Q1 2022: 45,000 USDC\nLeft to pay: 11,250 USDC\n\n**Polygon expenses:**\n\n**Contributors sdam3CRV rewards:**\nThe contributors rewards are estimated to 64,250 sdam3CRV/month for their work:\n\nEffective contributors rewards for March 2022: 51,400 sdam3CRV (Already paid from treasury Msig)\nExtra budget in case of new hires (up to + 25%): .12,850 sdam3CRV\nTotal monthly cost : 64,250 sdam3CRV.\n\n**Voting options:**\nYes, accept the DAO expenses\nNo, refuse the DAO expenses\nAbstain",

With the proposal we search consensus to perform the following actions:\n\n1. Create an SDT-ETH pool on Curve v2\n1. Withdraw our liquidity from Sushiswap (1,663,972.84) and redirect it to the newly created Curve v2 pool\n1. Get a gauge for the Curve v2 pool\n1.

      "content": "## Overview \nUse part of our performance fees and of inflation to fund liquidity. \nFurther details: https://gov.stakedao.org/t/use-part-of-our-performance-fees-and-of-inflation-to-fund-liquidity/510\n\n---\n\n##  Specification \nThis proposal suggests bringing the SDT emissions dedicated to Olympus pro to 25k SDT per week (from 50k currently), and redirecting inflation to pair the other 25k SDT per week with revenues from performance fees, and pool it in the Sushi LP and Cometh LP. This could run until the total liquidity of the DAO reaches $20m. At this rate, the DAO would acquire $200k of liquidity every month, which is equivalent to the current Olympus Pro rate. The two programs combined should enable reaching a good share of the liquidity reasonably quickly.\n\nThere are 4 different options for implementation: \n\n- 1. Launch liquidity program & bootstrap with 100k worth of SDT paired with ETH to provide liquidity of SushiSwap.\n- 2. Launch liquidity program without bootstrapping. \n- 3. Amend the liquidity program and resubmit the proposal.\n- 4. Don't launch a liquidity program and don't resubmit. \n",

      "content": "As a result of having locked over 2.1 million CRV on Curve.fi, Stake DAO will be eligible to receive an airdrop from a new protocol launching called Convex Finance. Convex Finance expects to launch at the end of April, but currently has no specific date set. Convex Finance was created by several Curve community members, and will offer a variety of services that utilize Curve.fi liquidity pools.\n\nThe CVX token will be airdropped to users and communities that hold veCRV (CRV locked on Curve.fi). The token supply for CVX is 100 million with 1% being airdropped. An additional 1% of the total supply is being given to users/communities that vote yes to white listing Convex Finance on Curve.fi (Stake DAO would vote yes/no on the communities behalf).\n\nUnlike the EPS airdrop on Binance Smart Chain, this will be a single airdrop. The airdrop of CVX will be instantaneous, and the entirety of the CVX tokens will be received immediately.\n\nMore information about Convex Finance and their launch can be found here: https://convexfinance.medium.com/convex-finance-pre-launch-announcement-3630b2a428d0\n\nConvex Finance can be found here: https://www.convexfinance.com\\\n\nNow for the important part, how should The Herd vote? As you know, we operate as a DAO. That is to say, our community will be involved every step of the way in how we claim this airdrop, and what we do with it. As this vote will require 2 decisions to be made, we will create 2 proposals for the DAO to vote on. The second vote is as follows.\n\nWhat should Stake DAO do with the airdropped CVX tokens? Please note these votes will run for approximately 5 days.\n\nConvert 100% of CVX tokens to SDT and gift them to the Sanctuary (those that have staked SDT on the governance tab at Stake DAO).\n\nConvert 100% of CVX tokens to SDT and distribute 50% to the Sanctuary and 50% to sdveCRV holders.\n\nConvert 100% of CVX tokens to SDT and distribute 25% to the Sanctuary and 75% to sdveCRV holders.\n\nConvert 100% of CVX tokens to SDT and gift them to sdveCRV holders.\n\nStake 100% of CVX on Convex Finance to receive a portion of platform fees paid in cvxCRV (Convex Finance LP token for locking CRV on their protocol). cvxCRV will be distributed 50/50 to the Sanctuary and sdveCRV holders periodically.\n\nStake 50% of CVX on Convex Finance (APY TBD) to receive a portion of platform fees paid in cvxCRV and distribute the remaining 50% to the Sanctuary and sdveCRV holders. Additional cvxCRV will be distributed 50/50 to the Sanctuary and sdveCRV holders.\n\nSell half of CVX rewards for ETH, and stake in CVX/ETH liquidity pool earning rewards. Distribute those rewards 50/50 between users staked in The Sanctuary and sdveCRV holders.",

      "content": "As a result of The Herd depositing 2M veCRV into the PPS, Stake DAO is eligible for an airdrop **every week** of approx 57k EPS (currently worth approx $280k/week for a year).\n\n\n\n> Given the high yield available for farming EPS at launch (circa 3,000% at the time of writing), Stake DAO has undertaken the following steps for the very first airdrop:\n>\n> 1. Claimed the EPS tokens now and been slashed 50%\n> 2. Staked the remaining 28,999 EPS tokens and locked them for 3 months in order to benefit from the high APY.\n###### *It must be noted that, whilst the claimed EPS are locked for 3 months, any rewards farmed are not subject to a lock.*\n\n\n\nAs these airdrops will be repeated every week for a year, Stake DAO will now delegate to its governance ***to decide what shall be the best course of action for the upcoming airdrops.*** \n\n> **Three** questions need to be answered:\n> \n> ***- What should we do with the weekly airdrop? (subject of this proposal)***\n> *- What should we do with the rewards from farming?*\n> *- How should the rewards be distributed to the Herd?*\n\n\n\n## The subject of this proposal is as follows:\n## \"What should we do with the weekly airdrop?\"\n\n- **Option 1:** Do nothing; wait for 3 months for the tokens to unlock, and then claim 100% of the airdrop.\n\n- **Option 2:** Claim the EPS tokens immediately and incur a 50% penalty for early exit, then stake these without lock to earn an APY of ~35% (at time of writing).\n\n- **Option 3:** Claim the EPS tokens and incur a 50% penalty for early exit, then stake with a three month lock, and earn an APY of ~3,000% (at the time of writing).\n\n###### *Further proposals will be submitted once the community has voted on this first topic.*",

Although these funds have recently been successfully deposited in the Curve EURS Gauge, the current strategy is not actively harvesting the accumulated rewards.\n\nThis means the vault is not auto-compounding returns, and its APY will remain 0% until this happens.\n\nProposal: call `harvest()` from the governance address on the current StrategyCurveEursCrvVoterProxy strategy (0xc8a753B38978aDD5bD26A5D1290Abc6f9f2c4f99)\n\n\nThis will:\n- claim all accumulated CRV and SNX in the Curve EURS Gauge\n- sell 90% of claimed CRV for more eursCRV tokens\n- sell 100% of claimed SNX for more eursCRV tokens\n- send 10% of claimed CRV tokens to the `voter` address\n\nA simulation shows this would result in an additional ~€48.5k worth of eursCRV tokens, and ~2750 CRV (to be used in the future to boost the earnings) when calling harvest right now. And earn an additional €12.5k worth of eursCRV each day.\n\n\ntl;dr Time to activate the strategy and increase APY!",
