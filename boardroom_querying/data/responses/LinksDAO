      "title": "[Proposal #22] Acquiring a Collection of Historical Spey Bay Golf Club and Scottish Highlands Memorabilia",
      "content": "**Short Summary** - This proposal seeks the approval of LinksDAO members to secure an agreement offering a family membership for Spey Bay to the Bryce-Maynard family (Alfie and Trish and their son) in exchange for their valuable collection of historical Spey Bay art and artifacts. The ultimate goal is to display these artifacts both locally in the Spey Clubhouse and online, enriching the experience for Links members and golf enthusiasts wherever they may be.\n\n\n**Community Sponsors** - Matt Fineberg, Ryan Prickette &  Paul Mixdorf\n\n\n**Links Team Member** - Chris Bruce\n\n\n**Proposal Category** - This proposal supports the primary goals of growing the community and growing the brand \n\n\n**Motivation** - As owners and custodians of Spey Bay, LinksDAO has the chance to acquire, display, and in the process, preserve a unique collection of memorabilia from one of its members. Embracing this opportunity aligns with the goal of preserving the history of our course and solidifying its new found significance in the golfing world. As enumerated in the original DAO documents NFT holders were granted discretion over membership policies and details, including giving honorary memberships to LinksDAO GolfClubs. \n\n\n**Detailed Summary** - This proposal aims to preserve Spey Bay's history and strengthen its community, brand identity, and place in the game. The Bryce-Maynard family*** has agreed to transfer ownership of the artifacts* in exchange for lifetime memberships for Alfie and Trish, with provisions for up to 12 guest rounds / year which will extend to their son.  Links Golf Club will take ownership of printed and framed items, while other trophies and silver items may be loaned to Spey Bay Golf Club or Links Golf Club for future events like the club championship; those items are not included for consideration under this agreement. \n\n\nThe plan includes enhancing the displayed items in the clubhouse with adornments like labels and plaques that explain what the item is, including its back story, a QR code link to a video about the piece, the piece’s “holder,” ect. Related, and in keeping with LinksDAO’s Web3 DNA we plan to digitize and take these items “on chain” so that they may be shared and experienced by Links members worldwide. This presents an opportunity to balance the cost of this proposal via NFT mint revenue, the specifics of which are as yet to be finalized and discussed below.**\n\n\n*See Appendix A for related images and details.\n\n**See Appendix B for further Memorabilia Mint details.\n\n\n**Expected Funding** - Approx $3,000 USD. This “Memorabilia for Membership” proposal suggests a value exchange rather than a financial one. ”Local” memberships to Spey Bay are estimated at $1,400/year, totaling approximately $14k on paper for every 10 years they stay members. While Links' actual cost includes lost revenue from tee times and labor/materials for displaying the collection, the overall financial commitment is reasonably low. Labor and Materials used are about £1,000 GBP and it should be noted that some of the work in service of this end has already been completed by the individual making the donation.\n\n\nPhysical items requiring expenditure  would include an appropriately sized plaque with the narrative behind the memorabilia and members, Alfie and Trish, who saved it all. Also, smaller individual labels, ideally digital, to convey the name of the piece and, potentially signify the “on-chain” owner of the memorabilia, an outcome of the digitization component of this proposal. An additional compensation pool of up to $2,000 USD should be earmarked from the treasury to cover costs and for contributors who assist in the fulfillment of this proposal should it pass.\n\n\n**Effort** - We anticipate an above-average lift from this point. The majority of the groundwork has been laid. Construction of display spaces in the Spey clubhouse is nearing completion. The next steps following the successful passage of this proposal include completing the relocation of the artifacts to the Clubhouse, finalizing plans to display these items, including appropriate accompaniments, and most significantly executing a plan to digitize these items on-chain, including a mint, and make them available for viewing by Links members worldwide. This work will require additional lift from community members supported by the core team. \n\n\n**Expected Time Commitment** - The team has invested approximately 40 hours in meetings, calls, and research to date. A similar amount of effort could be expected to “bring this home,” considering the amount of time and resources needed to digitize the artifacts and bring them “on chain” is mostly unknown and will require additional work to scope and execute.\n\n\n**Community Contribution Amount** - This proposal was drafted, and is being shepherded by Tungsten, who is compensated as a Starter under the framework of Proposal 14. Additional help will be needed, specifically around the digitization, presentation, and Web 3-ification of the artifacts.\n\n\n**Appendix A - Related Memorabilia **\n\n\n\nAll of the pictures to follow graced the walls and halls of the Spey Bay Hotel and Golf Club.\n\n There are additional items, while not pictured below, are part of the incoming collection.**\n\n(view here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19xSiPKYZ9k72yj76CWLr2mOcdFTcXE3xX-vIyn-dvFU/)\n\n\n**Appendix B - Memorabilia Mint **\n\nThe scope of this project could include up to 30 items\nHow to Get this Done\nDigitize the Photos:\nScan (or capture via camera) each photo.\nPhotoshop as needed.\nCreate a unique and catchy title for the future NFT.\nDraft a description, including any special details or history about the photo.\nStore the Digital Files:\nUpload the edited image and its metadata to a decentralized storage platform like IPFS.\nObtain the unique IPFS hash (CID) for the file to include in the NFT metadata.\nSet Up Mint Wallet\nUtilize existing LinksDAO Web 3 wallets and tokens to launch collection?\nChoose an NFT Marketplace:\nSelect a reputable NFT marketplace that supports Ethereum, such as OpenSea, Rarible, or Mintable.\nI advocate we stay on the ETH chain for this\nDesign the Mint\nMechanics suggested include a post mint reveal\nChoose the mint method (fixed price, auction, or declining price).\nSet the NFT pricing.

      "title": "[Proposal #21] US Course Vote: South East or Mid West?",
      "content": "Proposal Name: US Golf Course Feedback\n\n\nAuthors: Bez, cbruce, Cooper, Jim\n\n \n\nAuthor’s Note: These courses have been purposefully anonymized at the sellers’ request. At such time in the process that we are able to name the courses in members-only channels or privately, we will! In the meantime, please do not attempt to uncover the names or share guesses about the potential course identities privately or publicly, as it may hinder the course purchase process and upset the seller(s).\n\n\n\nTL;DR: As we’ve continued searching for a US course, we are having advanced conversations with two different US sites that we believe line up well with the course attribute preferences of the community. The setups for each transaction are quite different, so we wanted to share as much as we can regarding them with members to get your feedback and determine how excited members are about each opportunity. \n\n\n\nThis is PART THREE of a THREE PART VOTE. To gather more information about the community’s relative preferences, please vote between the two as if you were forced to only choose one. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSE Course\n\nTL;DR: A solid (but not near top 100 level) course in the SE US that we can improve with investment, and is playable immediately. Very easily accessible for eastern US, and location gives a good combination of longer playing season while being able to maintain quality turf (eg, bent grass greens). We would take over the lease and control all operations, but be required to have some publicly available tee times (semi private).\n\n\n\nLocation: City in the Southeastern United States, close to an airport with direct flights from most US hubs and many east coast / southeast cities\n\n\n\nHigh-level Description: Immediately playable course that is over 7,000 yards from the tips with solid bones and quality greens (bent grass) with room for improvement (e.g. remove a number of trees, alter a couple quirky / “tricked up” holes, re-do bunkers). Existing clubhouse with bar and restaurant, pro shop, locker room and dining rooms all in good condition. The course is public today, with $45-60 greens fees, and is profitable. \n\n\n\nTransaction Setup: In this transaction, LinksDAO would become the long-term lease holder (think 50+ years), so while we wouldn’t own the asset for the purposes of reselling the property, we would effectively be the owners and would control all aspects of the operation of the course. And if we wanted to transfer the lease to someone else, we would most likely get compensated in some material way for it. We have the opportunity to take over the lease and the course operation with minimal cash outlay which would allow us to focus investments on future improvements. We would also be getting a significant investment from the current lease holder for clubhouse improvements.\n\n\n\nMembership Policy: A condition of the lease is that some tee times at the course must be publicly accessible. Links would make the course effectively semi-private, giving our members advance booking periods and preferred tee times, and hosting members-only events (a la Spey Bay).\n\n\n\nMembership Fees: This structure is still to be finalized, but annual dues will likely be somewhere in the $500-1,000 range with some form of initiation. \n\n\n\nOther perks / benefits: A couple private / semi-private courses nearby that we could get members on through a potential reciprocity agreement. Lots of lodging options with potential for on-site lodging that would be built by the existing leaseholder who would continue to lease the adjacent land.  Tons of great additional F&B / Entertainment / Tourist Attractions nearby. \n\n\n\nAttribute summary (our high level assessment, ordered according to rank in our most recent course attribute vote) is an attached image\n\n \n![SE Chart.JPG](ipfs://bafybeifta5o2iils4qxwhi5cnldcomvl2ntbrcamsschug2ihfttuofwvy)\n    \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**MW Course**\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**: A Midwest course designed by a top level Golden Age architect, that will be renovated with the intention of being a top 100 level course and a potential Tour site, though it would close for renovation and not reopen until (est) 2026. We would co-own the course with the current owner, who would help fund the investment to get to that quality level. It would be a fully private course, and a number of celebrities and athletes have expressed interest in being a member. Of course, in a new development there are risks, and there is no guarantee of a top 100 rating, Tour event or celebrity members.\n\n\n\n**Location**: City in the Midwestern United States, close to an international airport with direct flights from all major US hubs and many other US cities.\n\n\n\n**High-level Description**: Designed by a Golden Age architect, it has been run as a public course and under-invested in. The course is being purchased by a new owner who has plans to fully renovate the course and clubhouse and relaunch it as a private club, with an anticipated timeline of being completed in 2026 - and we have the opportunity to join forces as a co-owner. The ambitions of the current owner are to make it a Top 100-level site and potential Tour stop. \n\n\n\n**Transaction Setup**: Links would be a co-owner of the course along with the current owner. Links would have the exclusive on offering national memberships to this club to our NFT holders, and NFT holders would also have the ability to join locally. While we wouldn’t be the sole owners, we would likely make up the majority of the membership and would have a corresponding say in steering the club and making sure that it is a good fit for our membership. We have already had some of these discussions with the owner, and after these initial conversations, feel like there’s alignment. For example, we have spoken to him about having all of his local members hold our NFT as a requirement for membership, which he was interested in. Additionally, while he was already in touch with a couple of architects to work on the renovation, we offered to introduce him to others and he was amenable to that. We have since reached out to two architects to see if they are interested and both are, with subsequent introductions completed.\n\n\n\n**Membership Policy**: The course will likely be fully private. It may look like Tree Farm or Old Barnwell in the sense that it is private but there are select opportunities for the public to get on. \n\n\n\n**Membership Fees**: We are still working through the final structure here, as well, but cost to join would likely be in the $5,000-6,000 range with ongoing annual dues in the $1000-2,000 range.\n\n\n\n**Other perks / benefits**: There will likely be a number of celebrity and athlete members joining this club who are affiliated with / from the area. \n\n\n\n**Attribute summary** (our high level assessment, ordered according to rank in our most recent course attribute vote) is an attached image.\n \n \n![MW Course CHart.JPG](ipfs://bafybeignkfcurcec35yuw7gikkfgpdtemtkgmjjch3pdia4ej2usoatcum)\n    \n    \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Proposal Details**: Please note that a vote for either course does not guarantee an eventual transaction taking place. Once we get to the final stages with either one and once we have permission to share more details on each course, including the names, we will have another vote to move forward with an offer / agreement just as we did with Spey Bay. This proposal is to confirm that the membership is interested in, and that the team should continue to pursue, each opportunity. \n\n\n**Effort**: Medium\n\n\n\n**Voting**:\n\n\n\n**VOTE 3: HEAD2HEAD - Links Members will be asked to choose preference between \"SE Course\" and \"MW Course\"**\n\n“**SE Course**”: I would prefer the Team pursue course option “**SE Course**” OVER course option “**MW Course**.”\n\n“**MW Course**”: I would prefer the team pursue course option “**MW Course**” OVER course option “**SE Course**.”\n\n“**Neither**”: I don’t think the team should continue pursuing either option.\n\n“**Abstain**”: Not in favor of either, but recording this vote counts toward reaching Quorum.",

      "title": "[Proposal #20] US Mid West Course",
      "content": "**Proposal Name:** US Mid West Course\n\n**Authors:** Bez, cbruce, Cooper, Jim  \n\n**Author’s Note:** These courses have been purposefully anonymized at the sellers’ request. At such time in the process that we are able to name the courses in members-only channels or privately, we will! In the meantime, please do not attempt to uncover the names or share guesses about the potential course identities privately or publicly, as it may hinder the course purchase process and upset the seller(s).\n\n**TL;DR:** As we’ve continued searching for a US course, we are having advanced conversations with two different US sites that we believe line up well with the course attribute preferences of the community. The setups for each transaction are quite different, so we wanted to share as much as we can regarding them with members to get your feedback and determine how excited members are about each opportunity. \n\n**This is PART TWO of a THREE PART Vote.** There will be a vote specific to each course, where we will determine if members are sufficiently excited about the opportunity that we should continue pursuing it. Then, to gather more information about the community’s relative preferences, we will ask everyone to choose their preference between the two if they were forced to only choose one. We also aim to garner a lot of qualitative feedback from the community throughout the process. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**MW Course**\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**: A Midwest course designed by a top level Golden Age architect, that will be renovated with the intention of being a top 100 level course and a potential Tour site, though it would close for renovation and not reopen until (est) 2026. We would co-own the course with the current owner, who would help fund the investment to get to that quality level. It would be a fully private course, and a number of celebrities and athletes have expressed interest in being a member. Of course, in a new development there are risks, and there is no guarantee of a top 100 rating, Tour event or celebrity members.\n\n\n\n**Location**: City in the Midwestern United States, close to an international airport with direct flights from all major US hubs and many other US cities.\n\n\n\n**High-level Description**: Designed by a Golden Age architect, it has been run as a public course and under-invested in. The course is being purchased by a new owner who has plans to fully renovate the course and clubhouse and relaunch it as a private club, with an anticipated timeline of being completed in 2026 - and we have the opportunity to join forces as a co-owner. The ambitions of the current owner are to make it a Top 100-level site and potential Tour stop. \n\n\n\n**Transaction Setup**: Links would be a co-owner of the course along with the current owner. Links would have the exclusive on offering national memberships to this club to our NFT holders, and NFT holders would also have the ability to join locally. While we wouldn’t be the sole owners, we would likely make up the majority of the membership and would have a corresponding say in steering the club and making sure that it is a good fit for our membership. We have already had some of these discussions with the owner, and after these initial conversations, feel like there’s alignment. For example, we have spoken to him about having all of his local members hold our NFT as a requirement for membership, which he was interested in. Additionally, while he was already in touch with a couple of architects to work on the renovation, we offered to introduce him to others and he was amenable to that. We have since reached out to two architects to see if they are interested and both are, with subsequent introductions completed.\n\n\n\n**Membership Policy**: The course will likely be fully private. It may look like Tree Farm or Old Barnwell in the sense that it is private but there are select opportunities for the public to get on. \n\n\n\n**Membership Fees**: We are still working through the final structure here, as well, but cost to join would likely be in the $5,000-6,000 range with ongoing annual dues in the $1000-2,000 range.\n\n\n\n**Other perks / benefits**: There will likely be a number of celebrity and athlete members joining this club who are affiliated with / from the area. \n\n\n\n**Attribute summary** (our high level assessment, ordered according to rank in our most recent course attribute vote):\n\n\n\nAttribute\n\nRating (1-4)\n\n\n\n**Course Quality**\n\n🟢🟢(🟢🟢)\n\nSolid today ($45-70 greens fee), but being renovated with ambitions are to be a top 100 course and potentially host a Tour event\n\n\n\n**Near Major Airport**\n\n🟢🟢🟢\n\nClose to international airport, accessible from both coasts\n\n\n\n**Playable Year Round**\n\n🟢🟢\n\nLikely comfortably playable April thru November\n\n\n\n**Uniqueness of Course**\n\n🟢🟢🟢\n\nOpportunity to create as part of renovation\n\n\n\n**Great Clubhouse/Bar**\n\n🟢🟢🟢🟢\n\nPlan is to build an amazing clubhouse experience\n\n\n\n**Practice Facility**\n\n🟢🟢🟢🟢\n\nPlan is for a great range and short game area\n\n\n\n**All Skill Level Friendly**\n\n🟢🟢🟢\n\nTBD but likely should have a variety of tees and won’t be overly penal given the existing site\n\n\n\n**Close to Other Golf Options**\n\n🟢🟢\n\nFew publicly accessible, high quality nearby options\n\n\n\n**Lodging Nearby**\n\n🟢🟢🟢\n\nLots of lodging options, including potentially onsite (not currently)\n\n\n\n**Ready to Play Soon**\n\n🟢\n\nPlan is to open in 2026\n\n\n\n**Famous Architect**\n\n🟢🟢🟢🟢\n\nWell-known Golden Age architect\n\n\n\n**Walkable Course**\n\n🟢🟢🟢🟢\n\nWould expect the course to be primarily walking with caddies but also have carts\n\n\n\n**More than 18 Holes**\n\n🟢\n\n18 holes\n\n\n\n**Other Amenities Onsite**\n\n🟢\n\nNo pool, tennis, etc\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n**Proposal Details**: Please note that a vote for either course does not guarantee an eventual transaction taking place. Once we get to the final stages with either one and once we have permission to share more details on each course, including the names, we will have another vote to move forward with an offer / agreement just as we did with Spey Bay. This proposal is to confirm that the membership is interested in, and that the team should continue to pursue, each opportunity. \n\n\n\n**Effort**: Medium\n\n\n\n**Voting**:\n\n\n\n**VOTE 2: MW Course - Links members will be asked to vote for or against continued pursuit of \"MW Course\" in a vacuum.**\n\n\n\n“**Extreme yes**”: I definitely want the team to pursue **MW Course**, and I would definitely plan to become a member at the course\n\n\n\n“**Yes**”: I want the team to pursue **MW Course**, though I am not sure that I would join as a member\n\n\n\n“**No**”: I do not want the team to pursue this course and would prefer they pursue other options\n\n\n\n“**Abstain**”: Not in favor of either, but recording this vote counts toward reaching Quorum.\n\n\n**What Happens After the Vote**:\n\n\n\nIf yes, the team will continue to pursue the acquisition of the course. If no, the team will drop this opportunity and pursue other options.",

The first level of  community involvement was executed through a poll that presented ten possible themes for designer direction. After concluding this poll and collecting community feedback the top themes were sent to a top golf logo designer, as directional inspiration in creating the above concepts. \n\nThese are options for the ‘Official’ Logo. A Members-Only logo will be voted on in a later proposal.\n\n_Team_\nLinks Representative: Cooper [Links Head of Community]\nDesigner: McWhorter (Professional Logo Designer) & Zach Baron (Links Team)\nProposal Writer: Ryanskeff [Links Starter]\n\n_Proposal Category_\nBranding & Marketing - Spey Bay \n\n_Motivation_\nCommunity and membership involvement in decisions that influence the future of “our course” at Spey Bay remains a north star principle. In selecting a logo for the club the community will be selecting how we wish to be seen in the golf landscape of Scotland and the world. The members of the Links community should be given this responsibility. They not only deserve it but are well suited to take it on.\n\n_Detailed Summary_\n\n- Run a poll that narrows down the proposed logo themes\n- Started 5/6/2023 in #members-announcements\n- Provide the designer the top themes to create logo drafts\n- On-chain community to determine the new logo for Spey Bay\n- Implementation of the new logo will occur across the pillars and onsite at Spey Bay, including Merchandise at the Welcome event in July 2023. \n\n_Expected Funding_\nBudget: Cost of the designer's time is the only budgetary consideration for this proposal. \n\n\n_Effort_\n\nProposal effort(low): Community team put together the logo themes, poll, & proposal. \n\nDesign(medium): Given the themes that Links members voted on plus the history of Spey Bay the designer will have placed multiple hours into the design of each of the proposed logos.\n\nVote(low): The feedback phase and community vote will be facilitated over a few days for each segment by Cooper, head of community. \n\nImplementation(low): After the vote has completed the team will update graphics on digital pages, merchandise, and new physical goods that will be delivered to Spey Bay such as ball markers, signage, score cards, equipment, etc.",

      "title": "[Proposal #17]: LinksDAO Scottish Golf Course Purchase",
      "content": "Proposal Name: Golf Course Purchase - Scotland\nAuthors: cbruce, Bez, Jim, nickwalkermsu\nLink to Commonwealth: https://commonwealth.im/linksdao/discussion/10108-proposal-17-linksdao-golf-course-purchase-scotland\n\nTL;DR: In our search for our first golf course to purchase, we have identified a promising property in Scotland called Spey Bay Golf Club. This vote is to determine if we should move forward with submitting an offer and working to purchase the course.\n\nSpey Bay Golf Club “sits on the stunning Moray coastline at the mouth of the River Spey, opened in 1907 and was designed by Leith-born golfer and distinguished golf course designer Ben Sayers”. According to golf architect Robin Hiseman it is “a charming course, but almost entirely overlooked by the golfing world. It could be very special.”\nhttps://www.msn.com/en-gb/sport/golf/golf-course-on-stunning-coastline-in-north-of-scotland-goes-up-for-sale/ar-AA1721pX?li=BBoPWjP\nhttps://www.ukgolfguy.com/golf-blog/british-restoration-opportunities\n\nWe believe this is a great opportunity that is both playable today and has unique potential to become an elite links golf course for our membership. We intend to execute this purchase while maintaining velocity on our efforts to acquire course(s) in the US.\n\nFunding: Current “guide price” for the property is £750,000 (~$900,000), and we would expect to use an amount in this vicinity (but could be more) for course purchase. The course purchase would be financed with capital from our fundraise, however, a similar amount would subsequently be transferred from the treasury to a corporate bank account to support ongoing LinksDAO operations.\n\nRationale: A primary goal of LinksDAO from the outset has been to purchase an extremely high quality golf course for our members to call their own - shaping the course and club culture with the direction of the DAO, and creating the future of a golf and leisure club in the process.\n\nBased on the geographic footprint of our membership, and feedback from the DAO in previous polls and messages from members of the community, our search efforts over the past year have focused, and continue to focus, almost exclusively on courses in the US, but this listing was too special to ignore and the timing of the sale requires us to act now should we decide to participate in the process.\n\nA LinksDAO acquisition provides a unique value proposition to any course and its surrounding community. We are an avid, global group of golf enthusiasts who also embrace all of the potential the next generation of golfers bring. Technology, inclusivity, excitement, and entrepreneurship are in our DNA. Guided by the DAO, with strong leadership business experience, we aim to seize the opportunity presented in this proposal to make Spey Bay GC a truly epic destination for members and their families, and a place local golfers are proud to call home.\n\nLinks golf is our namesake - we hold in highest regard Scotland’s gift to the world, and aim to coordinate our thriving community with great golf architects and designers to make Spey Bay one of the best Links courses in the world. If approved, LinksDAO will also utilize its unique network of partners and relationships with Callaway / TopGolf, Holderness & Bourne, Bridgestone, and numerous others to augment the onsite experience for players.\n\nSpey Bay Golf Club in Scotland (listing here, drone video of golf course here, location here) recently came across our radar and the course acquisition committee has commenced a review of relevant details like operational costs, development rights, and other due diligence, and determined this opportunity is worth pursuing for three primary reasons:\n\n1) The potential “ceiling”, or upside, on this course in terms of golf experience, quality, and rankings on world lists, is incredibly high\n- The course is a true Scottish links course (there are only 247 true links courses in the world, and Spey Bay is one of them) built in 1907 right on the North Sea, with 12 holes directly on the water\n- Due to environmental restrictions there are virtually no new links courses built on the coast in the UK (and most developed areas), and it is rare for one to hit the market - so this represents a unique opportunity\n- There is both enough land, and the proper zoning and permitting, to allow for both improvements to the course, and other additions such as lodging, practice facilities and/or golf facilities (eg, short course or putting course)\n- As an indication of quality, we have already had four architects with top 100 credits as well as another architect widely believed to be two of the best up-and-coming people in the industry respond to us expressing uniqueness of the opportunity and their desire to work on the course with us. The list of architects we’ve updated about this opportunity includes Bill Coore, Gil Hanse, David McLay Kidd, Rob Collins, Tim Jackson, Andrew Green, Brian Schneider, Kyle Franz, Beau Welling, Mike DeVries, and Keith Rhebb.\n- It has also been identified as one of the top restoration opportunities in Britain among such legendary courses as St Andrews, Royal Aberdeen, Royal Lytham and others.\n\n2) The price is low - both in terms of other course options and relative to our view of its potential\n- Even a price of triple the “guide price” would be cheaper than most mediocre courses we have assessed thus far in the US\n- Additionally, the ongoing and annual maintenance for this course, like virtually all links courses, is materially lower than parkland courses that we have evaluated in the US\n3) We believe that we can make this purchase without significantly affecting our efforts to purchase, and then improve, a course in the US\n- A cash outlay of this size would not significantly affect our remaining course purchase budget, and in fact would not change our ability to purchase any of the 4 US course options that we are deepest in diligence on. Additionally, while cash is of course important, we have a variety of financing and structuring mechanisms available on courses we are pursuing in the US such that we are not limited to only courses that are less than our current available cash. \n- The cost to operate this course is incredibly low, due to both its geography and course’s current maintenance regime - so this will not represent an ongoing drain on cash\n- We will enlist a management company (whether Kemper, or a UK-based option) and other 3rd party providers such that the team’s time is not fully consumed with the details of taking over operations of the course\n- While it will take up some of the team’s time to do due diligence and execute the deal, the fact is that we are constantly assessing many course purchase options (>30 currently being reviewed, 5 in later stage diligence)\n- We expect the offer / negotiation / closure process to be done in 45 days or less, so the diligence process will not have a major impact on the team’s time.\n \nUltimately, we think this is a unique and compelling course opportunity that we may not find again, and we think we can execute on it without affecting our ability to also acquire a course in the US in the very near term. A subsequent proposal could outline a scholarship fund to make visits to Spey Bay accessible to LinksDAO members who may not otherwise have the opportunity to travel to Scotland, in line with our mission of accessibility and inclusivity.\n\nProposal Details: The course is currently listed for sale (here) with a deadline for submitting offers this Thursday at 12pm GMT / 7am EST. This deadline is for those interested to submit their “highest and best” offers, after which point the sellers will evaluate the offers and enter into a closing process with their preferred option.\n\nWe are aware, both through the selling agents, and through other contacts in the golf industry, and there are multiple parties interested in purchasing the property, including other international buyers like ourselves. Please note that an affirmative vote here does not guarantee our purchase of the course - that is contingent on our offer being accepted, running a complete due diligence process, and successfully negotiating a purchase agreement with the sellers.\n\nThis proposal is to approve our acquisition committee of cbruce, Bez and Jim to move forward with creating and submitting an offer to purchase the course, and if accepted, move forward with negotiation and closing the deal. The committee will be empowered to price our offer in their best discretion, including prices over the “guide price”. We are not including a cap on our offer price as part of this vote to avoid compromising our negotiation and bidding position during this process (see: ConstitutionDAO), however, the committee will be instructed to only submit an offer that in their judgment, does not compromise LinksDAO’s ability to purchase a course in the US in 2023. On the other hand, if the committee finds anything in the course of negotiation and due diligence that they believe makes continuing with the purchase process not in the best interest of LinksDAO, they will be empowered to discontinue the process.\n\nIn the event of a passing vote and closure of a deal requiring wiring of funds, a treasury transfer to LinksDAO’s bank account would occur within the next 30 days to allow for continued operations of the business.\n\nReferences:\nCourse website: http://www.speybay.co/\nDrone video of course: https://youtu.be/qcdGXHlqLTQ\nReal estate listing: https://www.struttandparker.com/properties/spey-bay-golf-club-caravan-park\nLocation (Google Maps): https://goo.gl/maps/dbXLa33J7Y9MdRw97\nList of “true links courses”, including Spey Bay: https://migrantgolfer.com/the-true-links-courses-of-the-world/\nList of top restoration opportunities in Britain, including Spey Bay: https://www.ukgolfguy.com/golf-blog/british-restoration-opportunities\n\nMajor Milestones:\nM1 - offer submission deadline, Thursday Feb 23, 12:00 GMT\nM2 - offer acceptance (~late Feb)\nM3 - due diligence, negotiation of purchase agreement, and other legal/compliance steps (expected Mar-Apr)\nM4 - close of deal, purchase is purchased by LinksDAO (expected sometime Mar-May)\n\nEffort: Medium\n\nVoting:\nYes: I support LinksDAO moving forward with submitting an offer for Spey Bay Golf Club with the intent to successfully purchase the course\nNo: I do not support LinksDAO moving forward with submitting an offer for Spey Bay Golf Club, and wish that they stop engaging with the sellers in this process\nAbstain: Neither for nor against, but recording this vote counts toward reaching Quorum.\n\nWhat Happens After the Vote:\nIf Yes, LinksDAO’s acquisition committee will engage parties necessary to construct a compelling offer for the purchase of Spey Bay Golf Club, and plan to submit an offer by the Thursday deadline with the full intent of successfully purchasing the golf course.

      "title": "[Proposal #16] Community Contribution Rewards (2023 Revision of Prop #7)",
      "content": "Proposal Name: Community Contribution Rewards 2023\nAuthors: Cooper, Mrsenorhill, Cbruce\nLink to Discussion: https://commonwealth.im/linksdao/discussion/9407-proposal-16-community-contribution-rewards-2023-revision-of-prop-7\n\nFunding: Up to $42,000/month total (up to $36,000/month for community team leadership (up to 12 “Starters” each paid ~3k/month) and up to $6,000/month for task-based community contributions. For the first six months of 2023 the max would be $252,000 total. This Proposal will be automatically renewed on 7/1/2023 unless replaced by a subsequent proposal.\n\nTL;DR\nProposal 7 came in under budget for 2022. Thank you all for your votes and contributions to this organization! \nAs we close in on acquiring our first course, the functional operation of the DAO and community contributor system has never been more important.\nThis proposal continues to fund rewards for community contributors for delivering work that drives our mission while maintaining a responsible and predictable budget. A “pool” of monthly payouts for community leadership and a “pool” of adhoc rewards tied directly to future project or workstream proposals. \nThis proposal sunsets the “Pods” system developed in 2022, and officially replaces it with the five “Pillars” system, consisting of Clubhouse/Play, Community, Marketing, Partnerships, and Core Functions. This shift from over ten Pods to five Pillars has already shown reductions in siloing and increased collaboration, leading to greater organizational efficiency.\n\nRationale\nProposal 7 was a resounding success in experimental organization design. We enabled over 300 individuals to have visibility and 50+ to engage as paid contributors to Links in our first year - in a hybrid DAO model. Enabling folks to contribute what they could, when they wanted, according to our business needs allowed for unprecedented flexibility and for the best, most dedicated producers to elevate to leadership roles.\nThis effort was not without downsides - the open, quasi-permissionless nature of contributions resulted in occasional gaps in communication and mission alignment, particularly in mid-summer. We missed opportunities for clear communication, failed to track & measure results for certain projects, and early in the year lacked full-time support & oversight of community-led initiatives - occasionally leading to scope creep or, alternatively, insufficient resources being committed. \nThis proposal aims to keep the best of Proposal 7, while implementing solutions to the problems identified in 2022. \n\nProposal Details\nWe will reorganize the pods and contributors around our mission-driven Pillar system in 2023 - this should resolve our missteps and deliver improved output while reigning in on “blanket stipend” costs. Contributors will partake in periodic (no less than quarterly) group and 1:1 reviews with support from Pillar leadership. These reviews will enhance the pathway from lurker > member > contributor > leader > full-time that has been established with the pod system, and allow for check-ins to ensure availability and resources for key areas. We are currently evaluating software options to assist this system, which will be manually administered to start.\nWe have modified the budget in consideration of last years’ spend and enhanced the set of transparent processes for rewarding contributors that deliver meaningful outcomes. Our approach relies on principles that create equitable rewards and are supported by an “upward mobility” process from within the DAO. Community leaders who are hired to full-time positions will open up further 'starter' positions as the year develops. This is not an insignificant financial commitment, but we believe ensuring people have fair and predictable compensation for meaningful contributors is the right investment.\n\nUp to $36,000/month for up to 12 “Starters”\n- In the new Pillars, there will be a max of 12 Starters who are responsible for driving outcomes towards the LinksDAO mission at a high quality bar. (list of current Starters below)\n- These community leaders may be paid a monthly stipend to ensure their time, attention, and alignment to the LinksDAO mission, based on continued delivery of results and availability, and subject to quarterly review.\n- To ensure consistency, we want to reduce the turnover of these individuals while also creating clarity on compensation for this group, while allowing for new contributors to flow into leadership positions as the need arises.\n- We arrived at the 3k/month reward by evaluating the median national yearly income for a “Manager” role, dividing by 12 (months), and then scaling back by 50% to reflect a 20hr/week commitment to DAO leadership activities. We feel this is both generous compared to other DAOs with similar structures and financially responsible for our treasury.\n- Performance will be peer- and Pillar leader- reviewed to provide more flexibility in 2023. \n\nUp to $6,000/month for community contributors (ad hoc, across projects, ~1.2k/Pillar/Month)\n- Unused starter funds will be considered available for discretionary / ad hoc contributions. \n- New onboarding flows will be established to welcome aspiring DAO contributors into the system. A “bounty board” will be made available for current projects / needs, in addition to specialist and/or full-time job postings (not part of this proposal budget) like the Social Media Manager role.\n- Pillars will be responsible for generating projects (or workstreams) that create value for the community and further the LinksDAO mission. (for example: Course design, culture, features, and naming projects, and recently delivered projects like the GGA, Pro-shop, NFTNYC, Members’ Bounce, SXSW events, etc.)\n- Each project will have a “contributor” budget clearly outlined in its proposal. That money will come from this fund.\n- Community contributors who’ve established a reputation by completing projects will be eligible to become a member of the Pillar team.\n- Each project participant shall receive a proportion of the contributor budget for that project (or in some cases workstreams).\n- Payouts will occur upon successful completion of a project’s deliverables after being evaluated by Pillar leadership to ensure payout proportions are equitable compared to the initial proposal. Longer-term projects may be paid out upon completion of agreed upon milestones.\n- Proposal 7, Pods, and Pods M2 demonstrated significant “upward mobility” into leadership positions and core-team roles. We aim to improve onboarding and talent allocation through improved systems utilization in 2023\n\n\nCurrent Starters\n- alanglinais7#3176 - Analytics (Core Functions)\n- barbs#7712 - Mulligan Creator & Editor (Marketing)\n- BLL01#2800 - Pro Shop, Member support (Core Functions, Community)\n- db#8253 - Moderation, Special Events (Community)\n- Eth#5397 - Membership rewards, Support (Clubhouse/Play, Marketing, Community)\n- gabbie#6081 - Onboarding, Operations, Grow the Game (Marketing, Partnerships, Core Functions)\n- JenS#0401 - Grow the Game, Pro-Shop (Partnerships, Community)\n- ryan.prickette.eth#8740 - Events, Golf Concierge, Org & Ops (Clubhouse/Play, Community, Core Functions)\n- Ryanskeff#9046 - Operations, Gaming, Support (Core Functions, Clubhouse/Play, Community)\n- Tungsten#5400 - GGA, Quizhouse / MC, Special Projects (Clubhouse/Play, Community)\n- JKirby#0776 - Gaming, Special Projects (Community)\n\nMajor Milestones:\n- M1 (April 2022): “Onboarded” Pod Leaders formally to their roles (set expectations for each role and set them up for success)\n- M2 (April 2022): Pod Leaders defined and shared clear OKRs for each Pod. Our rationale for doing this AFTER the proposal passed is that each pod leader should be compensated for the work necessary to create these goals and they were aligned and incentivized to see those OKRs through.\n- M2 (April 2022): Provided bi-weekly text updates to the community on plans, progress, and problems related to OKRs\n- M3 (May 2022): Launched task management software that organized pod activities into projects and tasks, which also creates transparency on execution and contribution rewards tied to projects and workstreams.\n- M4 (December 2022): Completed a formal review of pod performance and shared results with the community. Rationale is that pod leaders should have a runway of six months to demonstrate results in their roles. Delivering outcomes will dictate keeping pod leadership roles.\n- M5 (January 2023): Formally transition to the PIllar model, adopt proposal 16, and launch new contributor onboarding flow.\n- M6 (March-April 2023): Complete Prop 16 reviews with all Pillars and contributors.\n- M7 (Early-Mid 2023): WAGBAGC\n\nStarter Responsibilities\n- ~20hrs/week expectation for Pillar projects and community team leadership responsibilities\n- Consistently engage within leadership team and Discord community\n- Define goals for projects and maintain a bi-weekly cadence of updates to the community (text or via community calls) about progress towards goals\n- Onboard new members to pods by creating “upward mobility” from membership to meaningful contribution\n- Oversee the identification of projects that meet Pillar/DAO goals and help steward proposals from idea, to definition, to RFC, to vote, and ultimately through successful execution.\n- Manage the approved contributor budget for projects and workstreams\n- Develop the talent of contributors within Pillars so “upward mobility” is clear and achievable for all members who want to contribute\n- Maintain the health of the DAO’s culture\n\n\nEffort: Medium\nVoting:\nYes: I support allocating up to a max $42,000/month of treasury funds towards a contributor budget.\n\nNo: I do not support this allocation.\n\nAbstain: Neither for nor against, but recording this vote counts toward reaching Quorum.\n\nWhat Happens After the Vote:\nIf Yes, the results will be sent to the multi-sig. If approved, Finance / Core Functions Pillar will ensure funds are spent responsibly. \n\nIf No, nothing happens. ",

      "title": "[Proposal #15] Global Golf Association",
      "content": "Proposal Name: LinksDAO Global Golf Association (GGA) Reciprocity Program \nAuthors: tungsten, stevepom, ryan.prickette, jaredd, barbs\nFunding Requested: $65k / 6 month budget max. Link here for the budget breakdown: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1XviGt4UaA1_KFjE29cGpFuNGtKyew2yqLIQpwI5mEl8/edit\n\nNOTE: At the discretion of the community leaders and with the ongoing support of the core team, this allocation will continue to be deployed bi-annually without the need for future proposals/votes. As one of the key benefits promised to Genesis Global Members this reciprocity program is fully supported and, much like buying a golf course, appropriate resources have been and will be provided to fulfill that promise without the need for future votes.\n \nSummary : A proposal to approve funding for the launch, marketing, support, ongoing administration, and growth of LinksDAO’s peer-to-peer reciprocity network known as the Global Golf Association (GGA) \nClassically defined: “rec·i·proc·i·ty” is the practice of exchanging things with others for mutual benefit, especially privileges granted by one … organization or individual to another. In this case it represents our version, a reciprocal network of LinksDAO Global holding golf friends and their courses organized for the exclusive enjoyment of its members.\nMotivation: Delivery of this benefit is a specific, and incredible way to provide real golf utility and value for our members. Second only to buying a golf course, is fulfilling the promise of reciprocity, providing access to a network of private courses and clubs where LinksDAO Global members could personally connect, plan rounds, guest and host one another for golf, and build ongoing relationships. Ultimately this “community within the community” will collectively become one of the premier networks for exclusive golf courses, clubs, and experiences, potentially numbering into the 100’s someday. Importantly it helps bridge the IRL GOLF GAP between mint and when Links Course #1 opens in 2023. Urgency is high as the golf season is upon us and the sooner we launch the sooner we deliver on a north star promise to drive access to the best golf possible for and among the community. \nEffort: Very High - This is one of the largest undertakings we at LinksDAO will tackle outside of achieving our primary goal. (#wagtbagc) The resources required to launch, manage, and grow this program are significant. Support will come from a coordinated effort between a dedicated core team and multiple Community Pods including Marketing, Development, ComProd, Analytics, and Operations. The overall effort behind founding the GGA is comparable to launching a startup and should be viewed as such including the understanding that we are starting with an MVP and that it is a living product which will grow and evolve as its members see fit and vote. We have a few unfair advantages that help mitigate much of the risk of this undertaking including access to funding, a pool of talented, passionate community leaders already helping, a base of members ready to support, host and guest, as well as the macro momentum of LinksDAO.\nDetail of Proposal: A request for an ongoing allocation from the treasury to fund the launch, management, rewards programs, marketing, and maintenance of the Global Golf Association - The private, peer-to-peer reciprocity program exclusively for Global members of the LinksDAO community. Included in this allocation is the budget for exclusive Alpha Class GGA rewards. Much of what the GGA will be is codified in the linked white paper. (https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1JojrBNpVnWtYkWeUs_biUw1nsjJbFvCIljpgyovFzjM/edit) It’s important to note that the actual build out of the GGA is underway and the platform will exist independent of this proposal’s outcome. It is the hope of the team behind this project that knowing that a primary objective of LinksDAO is to facilitate more golf between members, there will be broad support behind the goal of this proposal, to ensure sufficient resources are available to launch and grow the GGA to the benefit of the membership. \n\nMarketing Spend Notes and Details:\n- Sponsorship of aligned golf content and creators\n- A Referral / Rewards program to drive ongoing membership growth\n- Creative collateral for marketing and engagement\n- GGA branded member apparel and golf lifestyle accessories\n- The Alpha Class welcome package\n\nExamples of Participatory Incentives and Host Rewards (I&R):\n- Basic I&R like pro shop credit, modest apparel, golf gear, & accessories\n- Grand I&R like curated golf experiences, club sets, high end golf equipment, premium brand apparel, travel vouchers, and more\n\nAdmin and Management Overview: \n- Onboard and support GGA hosts and guests\n- Validate and maintain GGA network course data\n- Administrate membership referral system\n- Lead the creation of the GGA rewards programs\n- Oversee post round feedback intake\n- Monitor platform and network health\n\n*Because they did not exist at the time, the budget for the GGA and IMG Prestige admin and management was not included in the Pod leader and contributor compensation proposal earlier this year. We expect the GGA to share resources in support of the IMG Prestige program. \n\nRationale: \n- Supporting the allocation and deployment of resources for the GGA helps ensure we successfully deliver on the most important real golf benefit promised to our members.\n- Availability of token gated access to this program/platform reinforces the value of the Global membership tier.\n- At its core the GGA will drive community connections around IRL golf experiences and we should lean into this “North star” whenever possible.\n\nVoting: \n- A Yes vote says you want the team to proceed with the above plans for the GGA.\n- A No vote says you do not support this proposal and in effect do not want the team putting additional effort or resources into the growth and management of the GGA.\n- An Abstain says you want your vote to be included for quorum but do not stand for or against the proposal.\n\nResources: \n\nThe GGA White Paper (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JojrBNpVnWtYkWeUs_biUw1nsjJbFvCIljpgyovFzjM/edit#heading=h.e8418tpvy690)\nGGA WIP Budget (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XviGt4UaA1_KFjE29cGpFuNGtKyew2yqLIQpwI5mEl8/edit#gid=0)\n[WIP] Governance Doc (https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1VwLroSTW7eKRTRX_BVefEa0K3zuAErVXfMoxP96ZG-I/edit)",

With this vote, you will force rank different attributes to tell us what matters the most to you to help guide which courses we evaluate and move forward with.\n\nSubmitters: LinksDAO Team\nFunding Requested: None\n\nMotivation: Maximizing community input into the decisions leading to our biggest milestone - the purchase of our first golf course!\nDetails: We want the community’s input on what attributes matter the most when it comes to the first golf course that we purchase. \nAs with everything in life, there are always tradeoffs - we may see a course that is top 100 quality but isn’t close to a major airport, or one that has 36 great holes but won’t be open year round… - and these are the very real tradeoffs we’ll have to make when choosing a course to purchase.\nTo get the community’s input on what attributes are most important and how you would make these tradeoffs, we are holding a snapshot vote where each NFT holder force ranks various attributes according to its importance to them, with (1) being the most important attribute and (14) being the least important attribute. \n\nBelow are the attributes you will rank:\n\n- High course quality (at or near Top 100 level turf, architecture, maintenance)\n- Designed by a “name brand” / famous architect\n- Uniqueness of course (aesthetics, style)\n- Ability to play year round (no snow or extreme cold in winter)\n- Close to other public or reciprocal golf options\n- Walkable course (tees close to greens, not excessively hilly)\n- Playable by both low and high handicappers\n- Ready to play within months of purchase (little restoration required)\n- Near a major international airport (eg, within 90 minutes)\n- Has extensive practice facilities (range, short game, putting)\n- Has more than 18 holes (could be full or short course)\n- Has great clubhouse and bar / dining / event facilities\n- Has private lodging onsite / nearby\n- Has other amenities onsite (pool, tennis, pickleball, etc)\n\n\nPLEASE take the time to give thought to each attribute and rank them specifically for how important they are to you for LinksDAO’s first course purchase.\n\nWe will look at a variety of metrics as we evaluate the results - % of votes giving an attribute the #1 ranking, % of votes giving an attribute a top 5 ranking, a composite score of all rankings (eg, #1 rank gets 14 points, #2 vote gets 13 points…), and so on - and will share the results with the community. The output of this vote will give us valuable information to help inform what we optimize for as we are evaluating courses and choosing which courses we seriously pursue (and which we don’t). It is particularly important now as we have loaded the “funnel” with many potential courses and now need to start narrowing down to a smaller set of candidates.\nDisclaimer: this vote is not intended to be binding - for example, if an attribute gets the top ranking then it does not become a hard requirement for the course that is eventually purchased. BUT, the ranking will be a very important input into decision making throughout the course purchase process. \n\nVoting:\nRanked voting (not a yes/no vote): Rank all attributes from 1 to 14, where #1 is the attribute that is most important to you #1, and #14 is the attribute that is the least important.\n\nWithin Snapshot you will do this by clicking the options in the order of your ranking (click your top choice first, your 2nd choice second, and so on). Then, once you have ranked the full set of options, click “Vote” to submit your ranking. Please rank all 14 options before submitting.\n\nNote: The results that you see on Snapshot are not the final results. Snapshot automatically calculates a ranked choice vote to determine a single winner, but we will be evaluating the entire ranking. We will release results separately once the vote is complete.\n\nQuorum: 500 votes\nDuration: 7 days",

      "title": "[Proposal #13] Working Capital for the Pro Shop",
      "content": "Summary: Use $200,000 from the treasury to use as working capital for the LinksDAO Pro Shop - purchasing inventory upfront and warehousing items centrally. We currently have drop-shipping arrangements with our vendors, but moving to a centralized supply chain model will create multiple benefits for LinksDAO members: lower prices, faster shipping times, more selection, the ability to process returns, and expanded international shipping capabilities.\n\nSubmitters: @cbruce\nMembers: @BLL01, @Nick Walker, JenS\nCategory: Grow the Brand\n\nFunding Requested: $200,000\n\nMotivation: Create a better pro shop experience for LinksDAO members, and a more professional e-commerce operation which will further grow the LinksDAO brand with non-members.\n\nDetail of Proposal: $200,000 of the treasury would be converted from USDC to USD and sent to the LinksDAO bank account. These funds would be used for working capital for the pro shop - ie, to purchase inventory of pro shop items up front.\n\nThis will facilitate a move from our current arrangement, where we have items “drop shipped” from our vendors directly to the customer, to an arrangement where we centrally warehouse our inventory and control our own supply chain. This centralized approach will have many benefits for LinksDAO members and other purchasers of our merchandise:\n- Lower prices through larger bulk ordering\n- Faster shipping times because inventory will be available to ship immediately when ordered instead of being made to order and then shipped separately by each vendor\n- Greater selection of brands because we previously were not able to work with vendors that didn’t support drop shipping\n- Ability to return items because we have a centralized place to accept returns and a stock of common inventory\n- Expanded international shipping because we will no longer be limited by our vendors’ shipping restrictions\n\nThe $200,000 amount accounts for our current sell through in the pro shop, and it would also accommodate the next pro shop drop that is currently being planned with some additional buffer, so this should be a sufficient amount. If passed, we plan to report on the use of these funds and inventory levels on a quarterly basis going forward.\n\nThese funds would not be used to pay contributors, just to fund the working capital of the pro shop operation. Because inventory would be held on an ongoing basis, we are proposing that this funding be utilized on an ongoing basis going forward - ie, the $200,000 will continually be used to stock our pro shop and will not be “paid back” to the treasury at any point. At the same time, there is only a one-time need to initiate this funding as it will not “run out” after the initial inventory sells through. If we determine that this system isn’t working, we could vote to unwind it and payback the funds to the treasury in the future.\n\nA better run, more professional pro shop will enable a more efficient e-commerce operation, and as we sell merch to a broader audience these profits can be used to support the broader LinksDAO mission. (We plan to continue to offer members items at little to no margin, passing on the benefit of our partnerships to our members in the form of 20-40% discounts on average - but non member items are sold at a profit). Additionally, merchandise is a key lever to grow the LinksDAO brand and share our community with more golfers.\n\nEffort: Minimal - the logistics of the transfer from treasury, conversion to USD and payment to suppliers would be the only effort (the operation of the pro shop takes more effort, but this proposal is only in regards to the use of funds for working capital)\nExpected Time Commitment: N/A\nCommunity Contribution Amount: N/A\n\nVoting:\nVoting Yes = LinksDAO will transfer $200,000 from the treasury to an exchange, convert to USD, and pay suppliers for up to $200,000 of inventory to stock the pro shop.\nVoting No = No transfer would be made from the treasury.\nVoting to Abstain = Will add a vote to quorum requirement without choosing a side.\n\nQuorum: 500 votes\nDuration: 48 Hours\nResources: https://proshop.linksdao.io/",

      "content": "Proposal Name: Donate $10,000 to Youth On Course\nAuthors: JenS, nickwalkermsu\nCategory: Grow the Game\nFunding Requested: $10,000\n\nSummary: Donate $10,000 to Youth On Course, an organization allowing kids to play over 1,700 golf courses for $5 or less. Donation will be made via Roger Steele’s Team HIPE 100 Hole Hike for Youth On Course.\nMotivation: “We just out here trying to make golf cool, and you can't do it without the next generation.” This is a quote from the Team HIPE donation page. The cost associated with playing golf is a huge barrier for kids. \nRoger Steele is a member of LinksDAO and his YOC ambassador blog says it best: \n\"The ability to give kids access to the game is invaluable. Columbus Park, that little muni with nine holes and the seven trees I grew up on? It’s $25 to play. Asking a kid to pay that is an enormous barrier to getting them out there again and again. Just going to the driving range is fun, but you can’t fall in love with the game there like you can out on the course.\nIf you can get clubs in a kid’s hand, and a chance to play almost anywhere for $5, then you’re giving them that chance to discover everything golf offers. Life skills, networking, family bonding and new friends. More than that, YOC takes it a step further by providing scholarships and career opportunities for people who never thought that those doors would be opened for them.\nIf we can all be intentional about making golf more inclusive, more accessible, then we can empower these kids to shape the game in a way that benefits everyone. With everyone on board, the future of golf looks a lot better for all of us.\"\n\nThis is an opportunity for LinksDAO to contribute to an organization that plays a critical role in growing the game of golf with an ethos that is very much in line with the mission of LinksDAO’s community. \n\nEffort: Minimal - The logistics of payment from the treasury would be the only effort.\n\nDetail of Proposal: Donate $10,000 to Roger Steele’s Team HIPE, participating in the 100 hole hike for Youth on Course.  \n\nRationale: Growing the game of golf is an important value of LinksDAO. Youth on Course is a non-profit organization dedicated to transforming the landscape of golf and the lives of young people by giving them access to golf. Youth on Course has over 130,000 members and has facilitated kids playing over 1.6 million subsidized rounds of golf. The LinksDAO golf course will indeed be an exclusive course, but it will be an exclusive course that deeply values inclusivity and has a priority of inspiring the next generation. Youth on Course is a 501(c)(3) and all donations are tax deductible. \n\nVoting:\nVoting Yes = LinksDAO will donate $10,000 to Youth on Course via Team HIPE 100 hole hike from the treasury.\nVoting No = No donation would be made from the treasury.\nVoting to Abstain = Will add a vote to quorum requirement without choosing a side.\n\nQuorum: 500 votes\nDuration: 48 Hours\n\nResources:\nhttps://youthoncourse.org/yoc-ambassador-roger-steele/\nhttps://youthoncourse.org/\nhttps://www.100holehike.org/national/TeamHipe2022",

      "title": "[Proposal #9] Use Secondary Sales Royalties to Donate to the First Tee",
      "content": "Proposal Name: Use Secondary Sales Royalties to Donate to the First Tee\nAuthors: JenS, Cooper\n\nFunding Requested: 72 hours (5/27-5/29) of future OpenSea secondary sales royalties, with a minimum donation of $10,000 (no capped maximum).\n\nSummary: Donate royalty proceeds from 5/27-5/29 (72 hours) of secondary sales to the First Tee.\n\nMotivation: This is an opportunity for LinksDAO to contribute to an organization that plays a critical role in growing the game of golf with an ethos that is very much in line with the mission of LinksDAO’s community. The First Tee’s mission is to impact the lives of young people by providing educational programs that build character, and instill life-enhancing values through the game of golf.\n\nEffort: Minimal - The logistics of payment from the treasury would be the only effort.\n\nDetail of Proposal: Donate 100% of LinksDAO secondary sales royalties generated from 5/27-5/29 (72 hours) to the PGA Tour First Tee Foundation, Inc. (not a specific local First Tee chapter). If the vote passes, the donation period will be from 5/27 12pm ET to 5/29 12 pm ET. Due to current market conditions and the desire to make a significant contribution, a minimum of $10,000 will be donated if the secondary sales royalties do not amount to more than $10,000. The donation will be made within 30 days of 72 hour period closing.\n\nRationale: The First Tee programs give kids a safe place to grow with trained coaches who help them navigate challenges during golf lessons but more importantly, off the course. As a community built around the love of golf and its core values, this charitable donation helps spread the love of the game and will directly impact the future generation in a positive way. The First Tee founding organizations include the PGA Tour, LPGA, USGA, PGA of America, and The Masters Tournament. The First Tee is a 501(c)(3) and all donations are tax deductible. This is the first step in what we hope to be a long-term relationship with this organization, including hosting events for local First Tee Chapters at our course.\n\nVoting:\nVoting Yes = LinksDAO will donate royalty proceeds from 5/27-5/29 (72 hours) of secondary sales to the First Tee, with the minimum donation being $10,000.\n\nVoting No = No donation would be made on behalf of LinksDAO.\n\nVoting to Abstain = Will add a vote to quorum requirement without choosing a side.\n\nQuorum: 500 votes\nDuration: 48 Hours\n\nResources:\nhttps://firsttee.org/\nhttps://firsttee.org/partners/",

We recommend a YES vote on this proposal.\n\nMotivation: This partnership will give us additional credibility in the golf industry and will provide us with the expertise needed to source, acquire, and manage our first course. This is a crucial step in the mission!\n\nEffort: Large - Completing partnership negotiations, and continued work with the partner to source and acquire the first course.\n\nDetail of Proposal: The founding team has assessed a number of ways forward, and we believe partnering with an established, credible expert in course sourcing and management is the best option for an expedient and prudent opening of a world-class first course. We have spoken to a number of potential partners and have identified the ideal partner that is excited to work with LinksDAO on this crucial aspect of the mission. We cannot reveal the name of this partner at this stage given that we are still in the midst of negotiations and we don’t want anything to be leaked given the competitive nature of golf course acquisition these days, but this vote will enable LinksDAO to move forward with signing this partner and continue the course sourcing and selection process, with further community input. The partner will also make themselves available for Twitter Spaces and Discord Podiums to share why they are excited to work with us.\n\nRationale: LinksDAO would benefit greatly from external expertise in golf course sourcing and management. To acquire a world-class course, we need a world-class partner to provide us with sourcing and course management expertise. In our discussions with golf industry professionals, particularly with individuals involved in course sourcing, development, and management, we have identified an ideal partner to help us achieve our core goal - buying and opening LinksDAO’s first course. Without a partner in this realm, our mission will be much more difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in a timely and resource-efficient manner.\n\nVoting:\nVoting Yes = LinksDAO will proceed with partnership negotiations and finalize a partnership with [Course Management Company], and commence course sourcing and evaluation across the United States for the first LinksDAO Golf & Leisure Club.\n\nVoting No = LinksDAO will not partner with a course management company.\n\nVoting to Abstain = Will add a vote to quorum requirement without choosing a side.\n\nResources:\nhttps://collegeofgolf.keiseruniversity.edu/4-popular-golf-management-companies/",

      "title": "[Proposal #8]. The LinksDAO Genesis Tour - with Doug",
      "content": "\nProposal Name:  LinksDAO Genesis Tour\nAuthors: Ben (@BLL01#2800), Doug (@DouglasMetaBuckets#8177), Matt (Tungsten.867#5400), Joe (GoodToGoJoe#1142)\nLink to Discourse: https://gov.linksdao.io/t/proposal-8-linksdao-genesis-tour-with-doug/550/37\n\nFunding Requested: $50k \n\nSummary\nTL;DR Goals:\n1) Launch a Pilot Tour to create content with the goal of acquiring sponsors to generate revenue into the future.\n2) Showcase the LinksDAO Community and the potential for reciprocity amongst the greatest golf/web3 community on the planet\n\nContent creation based initiative focusing on a two week road trip up the East Coast of the United States. The Genesis Tour will follow Doug  (@DouglasMetaBuckets) as he meets and interviews various LinksDAO members at their home courses, plays a round with them, and talks to them about golf and Web3--among other adventures along the way.\n\nNot only will this pilot project highlight the value of the Links community, but it will be the first of many steps towards building out a proper content strategy to help attract a broader audience for Links. This content will expand LinksDAO’s media footprint, enhance our marketing efforts, and help to onboard new members.\n\n\nMotivation\nFrom day one, the mission has been about connecting golfers from around the world, delivering IRL value to the membership, and showcasing our community’s vibe. Bringing the energy and activities directly to members and sharing the uniqueness of the Links community is a must do in support of this mission. \n\n\nEffort\nMedium - A good portion of the work is already complete. With a greenlight from the community we will be able to finish the tasks required to make this a successful tour. \n\n\nDetails of Proposal\nBrand Visibility & Marketing - Now that we are fully underway and on track to achieving our mission, we have an unique opportunity to leverage this \"Tour\" to bolster the LinksDAO content library and in turn elevate our marketing efforts with great member driven content.  This will allow us to continue on our trajectory towards becoming “the world’s greatest golf and leisure brand.” \n\nAs it stands, the current outreach model for LinksDAO is dependent largely on two channels,  Discord and Twitter. The aim of this production is to enhance our approach as it relates to content creation, marketing, and building out a more comprehensive strategy for growing awareness of the LinksDAO brand, in turn growing the community\n\nContent - The output of this pilot tour and project will be a collection of timely and timeless content. We will capture and create a mixture of daily short form videos, singular “in-the-moment” photos, and weekly longer form episodes, among additional Links branded segments. We also hope to secure more sponsors to drive additional co-branded content, but at bare minimum the above will be the targeted output for this endeavor.\n\n‘A window looking into LinksDAO’ - The people are what make this community special and we want to share with everyone who these amazing individuals are--if you had the opportunity to come to SXSW you would likely agree with this sentiment. We are excited and looking forward to the future of what LinksDAO is doing for the golf community at large and this content series will be helpful towards achieving the larger goals of the project. Shining a light on who we are, leaning into inclusivity, and sharing our vision of what it means to be a member of a golf club. We can’t wait to share with the world who we are and what we mean by WAGTBAGC.\n\nProposed Tour Schedule \n\nThe following itinerary of dates and locations is tentative and is subject to traffic, weather, acts of god and acts of Doug. As such it is also subject to change. The team will do its best to communicate specifics for every location as soon as they are confirmed or if and when they are updated..\n\nWarm Up Week - Start off in the South:\nMay 9th/10th - Doug arrives in Charleston.\nMay 11th - Golf in the morning and a Bar Takeover with Links Partner in the evening. Giveaways/prizes for those attending evening activities.\nMay 12th - Modest member outing at Pinehurst Cradle, and Pinehurst Brewery featuring giveaways and more.\nMay 13th-16th - Short travel break / Light content production.\n\nThen Doug will continue North to the following locations. Generously he will be hosted by LinksDAO holders who are members of amazing courses and clubs in these areas. During these stops Doug will capture content featuring his hosts and their home course before, during and after a round of golf together. Additionally he will talk to them about their experience with LinksDAO and about the course they are enjoying IRL together.\n\nThe Tour Continues - More golf going North:\nMay 17th - Doug departs North Carolina\nMay 18th - Washington D.C. \nMay 20th - Philadelphia\nMay 21st - 24th - New York City\nMay 26th - Connecticut \nMay 27th - 28th - Cape Cod\nMay 29th - 31st - Boston\n\nFollowing the Boston events Doug will be released back into the wild, with our gratitude,  to continue vibing wherever the winds take him. In the days and weeks that follow we will transform the footage from the tour into content that delights our members and helps grow the Links community.\n\n\nGeneral Budget Overview\nIn the interest of the members (and thus the mission) :\nMerchandise to Giveaway during the Tour including event specific items (4.5k)\nCharleston Event (Social Event with Dryvebox plus  Bar Takeover) (10k)\nWe do not expect to spend the full amount being set aside. Some costs may be covered by sponsors. Once we have receipts from the host venue the unspent balance of the 10k will be returned to the treasury.\nPinehurst Event Double Feature (4k)\nMembers round of Golf in “The Cradle”\nSocial event at Pinehurst Brewery\nOther Golf stops on the tour (3k)\nFunds to cover the greens fees, carts, and miscellaneous expenses at approximately 10 courses where Doug plans to play a round with local LinksDAO members.\nProfessional videography for both main event locations (7.5k)\nWe are hiring a pair of editors to deliver double the featured content \nTravel/Lodging costs of additional Event Staff for Charleston/Pinehurst shoots(2k)\nTalent/Crew stipend (12.6k)\nA rough breakdown of compensation:\nA per diem to cover his lodging/food/gas. \n$400/day for 18 days = $7.2k \nDoug is being paid the same rate as pod leaders for his time. \n$37.50/hr for 8 hour days x 18 days = $5.4k \nTotal is approximately $12.6k\nMiscellaneous costs(2.4k)\nFunds for AV equipment (GoPro’s, mounts, memory cards) needed to capture/produce content. This equipment will see continued use on future tours.\nIncludes money earmarked to compensate assistants we might need to hire for help along the tour. If no additional help is needed these funds will be returned to the treasury. \nContingency fund for unexpected problems and/or opportunities along the way (4k)\n(Any sponsorships that are received will help offset these cost listed above)\n\n\nRationale \nProvide LinksDAO an outward voice to help it reach a greater audience and expand its brand vision. \n\nAdditionally, showcase the value of being in the LinksDAO community, either as a NFT holding member,  a Links Discord member, or a friend of one. \n\nThe Genesis Tour will also help introduce the model/format for Link Ups, a community driven initiative that will be rolled out in greater detail post tour.\n\n\nVoting\nVoting “Yes” means you are authorizing us to allocate funds to begin this process for the filming of this content.\nVoting “No” means, in effect, that you wish for the suggested proposal not to be passed. \nVoting “Abstain” adds to the quorum without choosing a side. \n\n\nWhat happens after the vote:\nIf passed, filming and production is slated to begin in April. Content will begin being published by the first week of May with content being regularly published with at least one video per week (possibly more if additional staff are added) for the following months.\n\n\n\n\n\nResources:\nVoting - A Guide to Participating in LinksDAO Governance\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zl3PqbO8e8wKIfFvrpR69u0aFLfy5XQD-85JSRMg7y8/edit#",

      "title": "[Proposal #7] Community Contribution Rewards",
      "content": "Proposal Name: Community Contribution Rewards\nAuthors: mrsenorhill, cbruce, cooper\nLink to Discourse: TBD\n\nFunding: Up to $71,000/month total (up to $36,000/month for pod leadership (up to 12 pod leaders each paid 3k/month) and up to $35,000/month for community contributors). For the remainder of 2022 the max would be $639,000 total.\n\nTL;DR\nCreate a fund for community contributors to be rewarded for delivering work that gets to our mission while maintaining a responsible and predictable budget. A “pool” of monthly payouts for pod leadership and a “pool” of adhoc rewards tied directly to future project or workstream proposals.\n\nRationale\nLinksDAO is one of the most exciting projects in this space. And while we’ve accomplished much in the roughly three months since founding, there is much more we collectively want to do. Long-term success will require an intentional investment in the people that make up our community.\n\nTo accelerate towards our mission, we need to attract and retain talent who can consistently contribute in actions that create value for membership.\n\nProposal Details\nWe will establish a budget and set of transparent processes for rewarding contributors that deliver meaningful outcomes. Our approach relies on principles that create equitable rewards and are supported by an “upward mobility” process from within the DAO. This is not an insignificant financial commitment, but we believe ensuring people have fair and predictable compensation for meaningful contributors is the right investment.\n\nUp to $36,000/month for up to 12 pod leaders\nIn the new pod structure, there will be a max of 12 pod leaders who are responsible for driving each pod’s outcomes towards the LinksDAO mission at a high quality bar. (list of pod leaders and bios below)\nThese pod leaders will be paid a monthly stipend to ensure their time, attention, and alignment to the LinksDAO mission. \nTo ensure consistency, we want to reduce the turnover of these individuals while also creating clarity on compensation for a group that has been, to date, a group of volunteers.\nWe arrived at the 3k/month reward by evaluating the median national yearly income for a “Manager” role, dividing by 12 (months), and then scaling back by 50% to reflect a 20hr/week commitment to DAO leadership activities. We feel this is both generous compared to other DAOs with similar structures and financially responsible for our treasury.\nPerformance, and potentially future voting proposals, will be required to continue in these roles long-term to ensure this investment in pod leadership is worth it.\nNote: Dev and Operations pod leaders will not currently take rewards as those roles are currently filled by members of the founding team\n\nUp to $35,000/month for community contributors (ad hoc, across projects)\nPods will be responsible for generating projects (or workstreams) that create value for the community and further the LinksDAO mission. (for example: recent delivered projects like the SXSW event or the merchandise store)\nEach project will have a “contributor” budget clearly outlined in its voting proposal. That money will come from this fund.\nCommunity contributors who’ve established a reputation within pods will be eligible to become a member of the project team, each receiving a proportion of the contributor budget for that project (or in some cases workstreams).\nPayouts will occur upon successful completion of a project’s deliverables after being evaluated by pod leadership to ensure payout proportions are equitable compared to the initial proposal.\nThe process through which “upward mobility” into pods and projects are managed will be a part of the “Pods M2” launch. But first we wanted to solve for the contribution budget.\n\nPod Leader Names, Descriptions, Discord Handles, and Bios: (Apologies for the formatting)\n\n**Partnerships**\nJLee#1816\nWorked in finance and b2b SaaS (real estate focused 🏗️🏢) for nearly 15 years in various BD and executive roles.

Sustainable, preventive approaches to managing behavior.\n\nLinksDAO contributions: Have been helping the organizationavoid groupthink;I’ve pointed out blindspots. To date, I’ve contributed across different pods (e.g., moderation, marketing, partnerships), with a focus on culture and community.\n\nI have noticed that LinksDAO members sometimes struggle to voice concerns/complaints openly (e.g., sending me a DM, one-on-one comments IRL). I have transferred these anonymous complaints to the leadership, which has ultimately resulted in responsive course corrections at times. To be completely honest, I’ve often wondered if people see any value at all in my efforts–asking hard (annoying?) questions. Playing the devil’s advocate, in a way.  \nNote: Dev, Finance and Operations pod leadership will be filled by gregan#7075, cbruce#2679 and mrsenorhill#2624, who will take no monthly stipend. This list of pods and pod leaders is not final and will evolve over time. In particular, one area that we are aiming to formalize and 'staff' is a Diversity & Inclusion pod or sub-pod, but there will be others, and we invite feedback, thoughts and engagement from the community on these topics.\n\n\nMajor Milestones:\n\nM1 (April 2022): “Onboard” Pod Leaders formally to their roles (set expectations for each role and set them up for success)\nM2 (April 2022): Pod Leaders define and share clear OKRs for each Pod. Our rationale for doing this AFTER the proposal passes is that each pod leader should be compensated for the work necessary to create these goals and they should be aligned and incentivized to see those OKRs through.\nM2 (April 2022): Provide bi-weekly text updates to the community on plans, progress, and problems related to OKRs\nM3 (May 2022): Launch task management software that organizes pod activities into projects and tasks, which also creates transparency on execution and contribution rewards tied to projects and workstreams.\nM4 (September 2022): Complete a formal review of pod performance and share results with the community. Rationale is that pod leaders should have a runway of six months to demonstrate results in their roles. Delivering outcomes will dictate keeping pod leadership roles.\n\nPod Leader Responsibilities\n20hrs/week expectation for pod leadership and community team leadership responsibilities\nConsistently engage within leadership team and Discord community\nDefine goals for pod under leadership and maintain a bi-weekly cadence of updates to the community (text or via community calls) about progress towards goals\nOnboard new members to pods by creating “upward mobility” from membership to meaningful contribution\nOversee the identification of projects that meet pod/DAO goals and help steward proposals from idea, to definition, to RFC, to vote, and ultimately through successful execution.\nManage the approved contributor budget for projects and workstreams\nDevelop the talent of contributors within pods so “upward mobility” is clear and achievable for all members who want to contribute\nMaintain the health of their pod’s culture\n\nEffort: Medium\n\nVoting:\n\nYes: I support allocating up to a max $71,000/month of treasury funds towards a contribution budget\n\nNo: I do not support this allocation\n\nAbstain: Neither for nor against, but recording this vote counts toward reaching Quorum.\n\nWhat Happens After the Vote:\n\nIf Yes, the results will be sent to the multi-sig. If approved, the Operations Pod and Accounting and Finance pod will drive ensuring funds are spent responsibly.\n\nIf No, nothing happens. \n\n",

      "title": "[Proposal #6] Donation to the Victims of UoSW Golf Team Car Crash",
      "content": "Proposal Name: Donation to the Victims of UoSW Golf Team Car Crash\nAuthors: jaredd\nLink to Discourse: https://gov.linksdao.io/t/request-for-comment-proposal-6-donation-to-the-victims-of-uosw-golf-team-car-crash/513\n\nFunding Requested: $10,000 (~4 days of proceeds from secondary sales)\n\nSummary : On Tuesday, March 15th a passenger van carrying the golf team from the University of Southwest collided with a truck outside of Andrews, TX while traveling from a tournament in Midland, TX.  The van was carrying members of the men’s and women’s golf team from the small Christian college located in Hobbs, NM.  The coach and six players were killed in the collision with two players in critical condition at a hospital in Lubbock, TX. The driver and passenger of the other vehicle were also killed.  This would be a donation made through a site set up by the university for the victims and their families.\n\nMotivation: These kids were traveling and competing for their team in a sport we all love.  This is a chance to spread our charity arm and donate to help a terrible situation.\n\nEffort: This would be minimal effort to accomplish, the logistics of making a payment from treasury or reimbursing someone to do it would be the only effort.\n\nDetail of Proposal:\nThe proposal is to donate $10,000 to the donation page set up by the University.  These funds would come from the LinksDAO Treasury wallet.  \n\nRationale: \nWe are a golf loving community, built to spread our love of the game.  There is no ROI on this, just goodwill and a chance to slightly ease the burden for those affected.\n\nVoting:\nYes = LinksDAO will donate $10,000 from the Treasury Wallet to the website set up by the university.\nNo = No donation would be made on behalf of LinksDAO.\nAbstain = Add a vote to quorum requirement without choosing a side. \n\n\nResources:\nUSA Today Story - https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/golf/2022/03/16/multiple-deaths-crash-involving-university-southwest-golf-teams/7059072001/\nUniversity Website – https://www.usw.edu/\nUniversity Facebook Page - https://www.facebook.com/universityofthesouthwest\nDonation Page (Direct Link)(Link also found on USA Today Story Above) and the University's Facebook page: https://interland3.donorperfect.net/weblink/weblink.aspx?name=E4567&id=5\n",

      "title": "[Proposal #5] Genesis Merch",
      "content": "TL;DR: We are going to drop incredible merch for members (and then the broader LinksDAO community) and want your input on what items should be prioritized to be available for the Genesis Edition. These items will only be available one time, so you can rep them and let others know you were involved with LinksDAO from the jump.\n\nWhat: Voting on what types of items should be included in the grand opening of the LinksDAO pro shop.\n\nWhy: Because we have an awesome logo and brand and an even better community that wants to proudly rep that they’re LinksDAO members.\n\nMotivation: This proposal matters because the LinksDAO community should have a say over what kind of merch and apparel is prioritized at the grand opening of the pro shop. It should reflect the taste, style, and preferences of our membership base and be reflective of what members want.\n\nEffort: Relatively low at this point as we’ve already built relationships with a number of brand partners\n\nDetail of Proposal:\n\nWe are going to share a list of different types of products with associated samples (note: these aren’t necessarily the colors of the items, just the types of items and these aren’t necessarily the price of items either). Members will rank the items they want in order (1 being the most), and the top-ranked types of items will be the ones that are prioritized to make it to the pro shop first. This vote will also help guide decisions for future inventory selection since it will serve as a poll of what types of items members prefer in the long run. The types of items to be voted on are: polos, vests, sweaters / crewnecks, hoodies, quarter-zips, jackets, hats, headcovers (driver and putter, both mallet and blade, but with custom Links designs).** All of the apparel will have a Links logo, as well. Please also know that the plan is to offer these items at a discount to retail prices for members as one of the benefits of NFT ownership!\n\nThe Genesis Merch drop will be available for a limited time to only NFT holders. The storefront will be token-gated to ensure members benefit from the proposed discounts, which will include a 10% mark up from cost. Once the initial timeframe has elapsed, LinksDAO will open the storefront to the general community, where non-members must pay full price for the merchandise. The storefront expects to generate a profit in the long run.\n\nGlobal Members will have priority access to all merchandise drops.\n\nMembers will have access to more exclusive versions of the LinksDAO logo relative to the general community, who will only have access to generic LinksDAO branding. In addition, Global and Leisure Members can purchase merchandise with logos specific to their membership tiers.\n\nRationale:\n\nThe community will be able to get access to incredible custom merch and swag that they wouldn’t normally be able to get. Additionally, repping the LinksDAO brand on and off the course will serve as a marketing and promotional channel for the community and build awareness of the movement we are creating in golf.\n\nVoting:\n\nAs mentioned above, this isn’t a yes / no vote. Members will rank their preferences in order and that will determine which types of items get prioritized for the Genesis Merch Drop.\n\n**Resources:\n\nPolos https://holdernessandbourne.com/collections/performance/products/the-perkins-shirt-heathered-hampton-white\n\nVests\nhttps://holdernessandbourne.com/collections/jackets-vests/products/the-king-vest-2\n\nSweaters / crewnecks\nhttps://holdernessandbourne.com/collections/pullovers/products/the-betts-pullover-1\n\nHoodies\nhttps://www.sologolfco.com/collections/outerwear-1/products/desales-hooded-jacket-charcoal\n\nQuarter-zips\nhttps://holdernessandbourne.com/collections/pullovers/products/the-westland-pullover-charcoal\n\nJackets\nhttps://holdernessandbourne.com/collections/jackets-vests/products/the-evans-jacket-navy\n\nHats\nhttps://www.proformam3.com/p/BKCPI-OCUXW/new-travismathew-rad-flexback-cap\n\nHeadcovers\nhttps://swag.golf/collections/headcovers\n\nFunding Requested: Short term: up to $12k (to cover upfront costs related to potential inventory purchase minimums) Long term: $0, expected to net profit.",

      "content": "Proposal #4: Links SXSW Members Retreat & Tournament \n\nAuthors: GoodToGoJoe#1142 (Joe), ryanprickette ⛳.🏌#8740, and Links Event Pod \n\nFunding Requested: $125,000 \n\nTL;DR\nInaugural Links weekend retreat.  The weekend will be full of golf, vibes, food, drinks, vibes, and more golf. Also a proving ground for future events near you - coming soon!\n\nWhy?\nBuying an IRL golf course won’t happen overnight. This event provides immediate and relevant utility to NFT holders as the DAO continues forward in its goal to acquire a course IRL.\n\nGolf related community events help shape a stronger bond between LinksDAO members and partners, which will cultivate more meaningful connections and maximize the DAO's reach within the golf community.\n\nConnection to LinksDAO Mission:\nThe SXSW event will help get the ball rolling on future event planning as well as help develop a framework for executing these golf-focused member retreats throughout the continent--and later, the world! \n\nEffort: High and Time Sensitive \n\nEvent Dates: \n\nMarch 12th through March 13th in Austin, TX for SXSW\n\nItinerary\n\nTotal capacity for this event will be limited to 125 registrants.\n\nMarch 12th: \n\nMuni Takeover and Casual Outing (Proper Food and Drink will be provided). \nNight golf and socialization at Par 3 (Proper Food and Drinks provided again). \n\nMarch 13th: \n\nPremium Course Takeover and Member Tournament (Proper food and drink provided). \nLive LinksDAO Product Reveals and Giveaways for Non-Attending Members. \n\nEvening Activities for Sunday will be dependent on attending members' travel plans. Multiple options if demand is there.\n\nEstimated Budget Overview*: \n\n$80k for Course and Venue Rentals. \n$25k for staffing costs (including travel/lodging/operations) \n$10k for marketing and promotional materials/merch/etc. \n$10k for Operational Expenses \n\n*Costs are based on quotes received from venues/vendors and do not represent exact final costs. These are to serve as an estimate to ensure the budget can cover total event costs.\n\nAll money brought in from this event (sponsors, registration, etc.) will go toward offsetting event costs, and any remaining funds post event will be returned to the treasury.\n\nDiscounts Thresholds: \n\n1 Leisure NFT = 10% event discount \n1 Global NFT = 40% event discount \n7 or more votes in one wallet = 10% Vibes Bonus Discount \n\nCost Breakdown with Discounts (personal travel and lodging not included): \n\nNFT Holder Status\nTotal Cost\nGross Cost per Ticket\n$1,000\nDiscounted Leisure (per NFT)\n$900\nDiscounted Global (per NFT)\n$600\nVibes Bonus Discount: 7 or more votes in one wallet\n(any combination of Global + Leisure)\n$500\n\n\nNOTES ON DISCOUNTING: \n1 NFT = 1 ticket claim to event (capped at 4 ticket claims per wallet - Global First Registration)\nWe are working to determine if crypto payments will be accepted. If they are, crypto payments will *not* be eligible for discounts. ONLY cash payments will be eligible for discounts. \n\nAdditionally, hotel blocks are being negotiated on behalf of members to help ease travel costs (personal travel and lodging not included - booking is your responsibility).\n\nGlobal Members will also have access to 48hr Early Pre-Registration period. Any remaining tickets after Global Early Registration closes will be available to Leisure members.\n\nGlobals holding Leisure passes can book groups up to 4 ticket claims per wallet. \n\nVoting: \n\nYes: I support the organization and execution of this event.\n\nNo: Do not proceed with planning and executing this event.\n\nAbstain: Neither for nor against, but recording this vote counts toward reaching Quorum.\n\nWhat Happens After the Vote: \n\nIf Yes, the results will be sent to the multi-sig, if approved, venues will be booked, and the process for signing up members will begin.\n\nIf No, nothing happens. No event will be booked.\n\nResources: \nCost Breakdown Chart (Google Sheet)\nSurvey Results (Google Forms)\n\n",
