      "title": "Proposal for Purchasing Baxter’s BOTB NFT Collection for the Community Wallet",
      "content": "Introduction\nBaxter is offering his total BOTB collection for 1 ETH, while the current market value of the collection, based on floor prices, is approximately 3 ETH. This acquisition represents a strategic opportunity for the community to significantly increase our Intellectual Property (IP) holdings and our ‘rare’ BOTBs’ digital base.\n\nRationale:\n1. Intellectual Property Expansion\nThe IP can be leveraged for future community-led initiatives such as branding, marketing, collaborations, or other creative endeavors. This strengthens our portfolio and gives us flexibility for future use cases.\n2. Opportunity for Value Growth\n\nThe current market value of the collection is estimated at 3 ETH, yet Baxter is offering it for 1 ETH. \n\nThis price discrepancy offers immediate value to the community. 3. Acquisition of Rare NFTs/ Distinguished Traits\nBy adding more rare NFTs to the community wallet, we bolster our digital asset base. Baxter possesses multiple NFTs with rare or distinguished traits including Fur/Specie traits like: Lava, Gold and Rainbow Fur. But also the Rainbow wizard hat for the Bears Collection, the crown, the Yazuka trait and the superman suit.\n\nTransaction Details:\n• Seller: Baxter\nOpenSea profile: Link to Baxter’s Collection\nhttps://opensea.io/Baxter/collected?search%5Bcollections%5D%5B0%5D=bullsontheblock\n• Collection: Bulls on the Block (BOTB) NFTs\n• Offered Price: 1 ETH\n• Market Valuation: 3 ETH (based on current floor prices)\nThe Bull Collection Specialty’s:\n● 39 BOTB OG’s: Including Special Bulls: 3 Rainbow Bulls and 4 crown traits\n● 78 BOTB EVO: 1 Golden Bull, 3 Lava Bulls, 4 Rainbow Bulls\n● 58 Bears On The Block: 1 rainbow wizard hat, 2 with a crown, 1 Yazuka, 1 lava and 1 rainbow bear\n \nConclusion:\nAcquiring Baxter's BOTB NFT collection for 1 ETH increases our intellectual property that can enhance our brand and creative initiatives but also capitalizes on the significant disparity between the offered price and the current market value. The rare traits and distinguished NFTs included in this collection will further expand our digital data base in rarirty\n\nPlease vote!",

      "title": " AIP-524: ApeLance on ApeChain : WEB 3.0 Bridge (Resubmission)",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\nApeLance is set to transform the freelance landscape by offering a secure, transparent, and efficient platform powered by ApeChain. By ensuring instant payments, confidentiality, and a robust verification system, ApeLance provides a reliable and innovative solution for freelancers and clients worldwide.\n\n> **Problem:** All platforms use third-party payment systems. Traditional freelance platforms charge high fees (up to 40%) and delay payments, which can be a big problem for freelancers.\nIf these payment systems are not available in a particular country, freelancers can face difficulties, including the risk of not receiving their payments. Even when these systems do work, they often charge very high fees. In Asian regions, many freelancers do gig work on the side, and their earnings are typically low. For example, if I complete a $50 job and have to pay a $10 fee, it feels unfair to me.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreiflqk6e6glaepaiknhcd5o2u6rmhk3vq2bp63tucfzbrjtrer7cmu)\n\n> **The Solution: ApeLance**\nPayments in ApeCoin are instant and transparent, significantly reducing the risk of non-payment or delayed payment. Smart contracts hold funds in escrow and release them upon the completion of predefined milestones, ensuring that both parties fulfill their obligations.Payment delays can disrupt the cash flow for freelancers.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiegny2ckkixlaagjhmrfb2l4bduoaky6ovvwozg3cknqo4ojbl5pu)\n\n \n![b964c4877c398cd2d1d12ebf3c391097c47a37ff.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeih7a5yvzqbppm5b57snmrtep3q5jdxbmjojfo4hyi4qc3al27eu5y)\n    \n\n**Bidding System**\n\nSometimes, employers may not know how to manage their projects or who to hire. In such cases, they can simply post their project on Apelance. People who have the skills and knowledge to complete the job can then submit their own bids, including the price and the time needed to finish the work. This is a unique feature not found on any other freelance platform. Additionally, by setting a budget, clients can quickly find the right person for the job from a wide range of options. \n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeihsxlzruv26g7reilsvh4nw4oypk2665l6tgufv4uixvqxeleuu3u)\n    \n![image](ipfs://bafkreidl3gxs4a7sjq3ycfyuj6kyxdb3u3iznffu7ks7yfstsjze2d757y)\n\n**Most lowes fee platform of this industry! and more…**\n\n_0.5% marketplace fee will be charged if paying and receiving payments using ApeCoin. 1% fee will be charged if payment is made in other coins._\n\n- New User Acquisition: By targeting freelancers and clients globally, ApeLance will attract new users to the ApeCoin ecosystem, including those who have not previously engaged with crypto. ApeLance will encourage active participation from the ApeCoin community, including developers, designers, marketers, and other freelancers, fostering a vibrant and collaborative environment. The platform will help businesses find skilled freelancers quickly and efficiently, driving economic activity within the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n- NFT Verification: The NFT verification feature will incentivize NFT holders to use and hold ApeCoin, increasing engagement within the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n- Long-Term Viability: The decentralized and transparent nature of ApeLance ensures its sustainability without reliance on a central authority, aligning with the principles of decentralization and self-sovereignty central to the ApeCoin community.\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiceyeeraotegcdaahceh375w4m5xlmaiqxswxpkv4lchmdnirjbly)\n\n> The 0.1% of the market we are targeting amounts to $500 million, representing the total sales between employers and employees. We will generate revenue by taking a commission from these transactions.\n\n**Challenges in Asia**\nThe reason for focusing on Asian countries is that they are often ranked low in the freelance market because of payment issues. As I mentioned earlier, the payment systems either don’t work, or banks don’t support them. The few systems that do work charge high fees. Even though we all live on the same planet, the opportunities are different. Just think about it—there isn’t even a single McDonald’s or Starbucks in our country. That’s why I want to solve at least one problem that Asians face.\n\n![9b80b7ed170f8c2e365da298bea27e2c9da12fac.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeibkksz54cbzgyrrswnkdyepwaaqkg267sxchfmww2erwy5e3saezu)\n    \n_Our goal is to create a blockchain-based P2P freelance platform to capture 0.1% of this rapidly growing market. Unpredictable events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent isolation have demonstrated that people’s lives are not fixed. The next generation dreams of working on diverse projects from anywhere in the world rather than settling in one place._\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n![image](ipfs://bafkreifoxajjcursujursqi27tu5joitvj3p3difjtngyixrqi3d7hzvum)\n    \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidfzngath63vvlyeukvmb6weauzyn4gubxpk425lclboki7eagaa4)\n\nWe plan to spend 20% of commissions rewarding our most active users and 10% to support initiatives of ApeCoin DAO. Our goal for the next five years is to attract 0.1% of the market, which is estimated $2.5 million. The 20% of commissions allocated for rewarding our most active users will be distributed based on a point system. Points will be awarded for activities such as completing projects, receiving high ratings, and contributing to community discussions. These points can be redeemed for ApeCoin or used to access premium features. The 10% allocated to support ApeCoin DAO initiatives will be used to fund projects and events that align with the DAO’s goals, such as educational programs, community meetups, and development grants. Detailed criteria and application processes for these funds will be developed in collaboration with the DAO.\nAdditionally, users will receive a Job NFT Badge, and job ads and information for NFT-certified users within the Yuga Labs ecosystem will appear at the top of listings. Similarly, Mocaverse NFTs will also rank high. \n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeidhe2tkcovand6x6ssr4f2lxtqc3n577ljh2amjcwmve64k5l2ire)\n    \nRegarding the use of ApeCoin trademarks, we do not expect to maintain full ownership rights to the content or IP created as a result of the approval of our proposal. We anticipate that any content produced will be owned by the ApeCoin DAO, aligning with the principles of decentralization and community ownership.\n\n### OVERALL COST\n> Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = **$147,000**\n\nTwo tranches of funding have been requested: Upon approval, the initial phase would require $67,000 to cover platform development and launch expenses. The second tranche, at the start of Milestone 3, would require $80,000 for marketing, monitoring, maintenance, and other miscellaneous costs.\n\n**Technical Development:**\n1. **Smart Contract Development:** $3,000\nDeveloping the smart contracts that will power the decentralized freelance marketplace, ensuring security and functionality.\n2. **Integration with ApeChain**: $4,000\nIntegrating the platform with the ApeChain blockchain, including wallet integration and transaction processing.\n3. **Security Audits:** $20,000\nConducting comprehensive security audits to identify and fix vulnerabilities in the smart contracts and platform.\n4. **Blockchain Node Setup and Maintenance:** $10,000\nSetting up and maintaining the necessary blockchain nodes to support the platform’s operations.\n\n**User Interface Design:**\n5. **UX/UI Design:** $5,000\nDesigning the user interface for the platform, focusing on user experience and ease of use.\n6. **Front-End Development:** $10,000\nDeveloping the front-end of the platform, including responsive design for different devices.\n7. **Testing and Iteration:** $5,000\nConducting user testing and iterating on the design based on feedback to ensure a seamless user experience.\n\n**Deployment and Launch:**\n8. **Deployment Costs:** $10,000\nDeploying the platform on the ApeChain mainnet, including final testing and optimization.\n9. **Launch Marketing:** $50,000\nMarketing activities to promote the platform launch, including social media campaigns, influencer partnerships, and press releases.\n\n**Monitoring and Maintenance (1 year):**\n10. **Ongoing Maintenance:** $10,000\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance of the platform to ensure stability, performance, and security. This includes server costs, bug fixes, and updates.\nMiscellaneous Expenses:\n11. **Contingency Fund:** $20,000\nAllocated for unforeseen expenses and to cover any additional costs that may arise during the project. \n\n![84a2f86f874d3644329349e257d964c105565f08.jpeg](ipfs://bafybeiaxweoae6ugdtsmtamthe3zff5upobxabqtnqg6frai32zprjnqwe)\n\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: (https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-524-apelance-on-apechain-web-3-0-bridge-resubmission/26042)\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-466: Proposal To Close Non-Essential Working Groups",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\nThis proposal suggests the following:\n1. Dissolve the Governance Working Group: AIP-239: Working Group Guidelines & The Governance Working Group Charter.\n2. Dissolve the Marketing & Communications Working Group: AIP-246: Working Group Charter - Marketing & Communications.\n3. Dissolve the Metaverse Working Group: AIP-245: Working Group Charter - Metaverse.\n4. Dissolve the Web3 Development Working Group: AIP-376: Working Group Charter - Web3 Development.\n\nThe DAO created these working groups, and the DAO is well within its actions, activities, and purview to close them as per [AIP-239: Working Group Guidelines & The Governance Working Group Charter](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-239-working-group-guidelines-the-governance-working-group-charter/11462).\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeiczfdgqe2epgllwz66b2gntu6ncaa5vzikpfnqcaici47fxewuf5m)\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nCollectively, all four working groups are costing or will cost the DAO almost **$3M per year**.\n\nTo date, the new Working Groups have been largely ineffective in their mandate.\n\nAs per the Q1/24 financial reports which we all knew would be bad (and we have yet to see Q2 & Q3), it is clear that the treasury is fast running out of **disposable funds**. [Ape Foundation Transparency Report - 2024 - Q1](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/ape-foundation-transparency-report-2024-q1/25720). We the DAO need to stop the financial bleeding and to take necessary steps to preserve the treasury and reposition it for prosperity.\n\nThis proposal has the following vital benefits:\n\n1. The DAO immediately saves money.\n2. The DAO can re-purpose LESS funds to hire/contract experienced third-parties who have a lot more experience in the specific areas previously outlined in this WG charter.\n3. The DAO no longer has to deal with the distractions, funding, and down time associated with elections as well as the budget proposals and voting for these working groups.\n4. The Ape Foundation can focus on specific mandates which are beneficial to the smooth operation of the DAO.\n5. The Ape Foundation can hire and contract third-party teams//providers on an as-needed basis. This also provides the flexibility of being able to switch teams/providers if they fail to perform as expected or if they don’t perform as per their mandated KPIs, OKRs or if they don’t adhere to strict transparency and accountability guidelines.\n\n### OVERALL COST\n*Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $0*\n\nRequests of the APE Foundation:\n\n- Dissolve the aforementioned working groups.\n- Pay in full, to affected stewards, any/all amounts that are in arrears.\n- Wind-down of the operations of any/all activities and entities.\n- Prevent the DAO from creating any new DAO funded working groups [under the existing charters].\n- Additionally, at its discretion, the Ape Foundation would put up RFPs for activities and work which were previously required to be performed by the aforementioned working group. As per the RFP, hire third-party teams which would be directed to handle all activities previously performed by this WG.\n- Manage and co-ordinate the consulting and hiring of any third-parties selected by the RFP to perform the required roles with specific KPIs and OKRs which are to be shared with the DAO community.\n- As needed, display a new Discourse category called “Job Description” related to either a work for hire request or an RFP so that the DAO community can have the opportunity to participate in such hiring opportunities.\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: (https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-466-proposal-to-close-non-essential-working-groups/24526)\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*\n\n### IMPORTANT NOTE: The BOTB Snapshot is a mirrored version of the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot.\nMembers will vote with BOTB NFTs on our BOTB Snapshot. \n\nDelegated voting will then be done on the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot with the botbape.eth wallet.\n\nRead, research, discuss - See what you think, fellow BOTBs!

Our platform is more than just a website; it’s a revolutionary space where individuals of all skill levels can unleash their imagination and bring their visions to life. With DashBO, content creation is no longer reserved for the select few – it’s now accessible to everyone.\n\nDashBO is a User-Generated Content (UGC) platform, which means our platform thrives on the creativity and contributions of its members. UGC platforms empower users to share their unique ideas and creations, and foster innovation . By harnessing the power of UGC, DashBO enables a diverse range of content that reflects the rich creativity of its users, providing endless inspiration and opportunities for growth.\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned artist or a beginner looking to explore your creative side, DashBO provides intuitive tools and resources to help you craft captivating 3D animations or poses with ease.

With our emphasis on democratizing content creation and leveraging users’ NFT profile pictures, DashBO is not just a platform – it’s a community where imagination knows no bounds.\n\nOur platform DashBO will be built on ApeChain. ApeChain’s robust infrastructure ensures fast transaction times, low fees, and enhanced security, making it the ideal foundation for a cutting-edge content creation platform. This technology enables seamless integration and interaction within the ApeCoin ecosystem, allowing for greater interoperability and expanding the possibilities for creators.\n\nA pre-release, limited functionality beta version of DashBO will be deployed in partnership with Yuga Labs via BAYC. com exclusively to all BAYC and MAYC holders via the BAYC. com Profile system. Once the full platform is launched, all BAYC and MAYC holders – as well as Meebits – will have immediate access to the full platform and functionalities. Our platform will also support other Yuga assets like Kodas and MoonBirds upon their releases. Other collections such as CloneX and AKCB that offer 3D models to their communities are supported, and for those that don’t as of yet – such as Mocaverse, 0n1 Force, or Azuki and many others – we have prepared the base model for the generation of the full range of 3D models using our system when onboarded. DashBO will help onboard these communities to the ApeCoin ecosystem and ApeChain.\n\n**YUGA SUPPORT**:\n\nIn addition to contracting Inceptive Studios to create a complete collection of unofficial, DashBO-ready models for MAYC, and giving us access to the full collection of official BAYC models for the system, Yuga Labs will be providing Meebits, Kodas, and MoonBirds 3D assets as they become available for inclusion.\n\n**FEATURES:**\n\n**1.

      "title": " AIP-502: The Apemobile - Guerrilla marketing meets a KOL partnership (Resubmission)",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION:\n**ApeCoin needs more marketing. Period.**\nIt’s not easy to stand out and get the attention of people nowadays… so, we need guerrilla marketing.\n\n**Guerrilla marketing** is a highly effective strategy due to its ability to deliver high impact at a low cost. By leveraging the psychological impact and viral nature of unconventional tactics, it has the ability to generate significant buzz and engagement.\n\n**KOL partnerships and brand ambassadorships** are a proven model in web3 and are widely adopted by top-tier projects in this space. To date, ApeCoin does not have a single partnership of this kind.\n\nThis AIP offers a bold mix of the above mentioned :muscle:\n\nEducational content and marketing by kodama.eth - amplified by the Apemobile!\n\nAn ApeCoin branded BMW (an M3, 4, or 8 Competition).\nCustom license plate.\nApeCoin branding such as but not limited to the ApeCoin logo on the tank cap and “Powered by ApeCoin” writing.\n\nThe car will be called Apemobile and will be established as status symbol of success within the whole web3 space. Leveraged by a multi-year partnership with web3 KOL kodama.eth and the targeted use of guerilla marketing tactics in order to amplify **educational content around the DAO, ApeCoin & ApeChain.**\n\n**The car will be a tool to polarize and get attention.**\n\n**In an endless X feed you need to stand out.** You need to grab the attention and once you have it, you use it to educate and make them one of us :wink:\n\nNOTE: The Apemobile can be leveraged by the whole community. Not just kodama.\nThe pictures can be used by everyone.\n\nThe AIP author will work closely with the Marketing and Communications working group, who have the option to opt-in to particpate, to maximize the benefits of this initiative.\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM:\n\n**A multi-year partnership with kodama.eth, web3 KOL**\n\nKodama has a large, engaged following within the web3 community. Partnering with him will significantly increase the brand’s exposure and reach the crypto-native audience on an ongoing basis. He will commit to creating content, joining spaces, and attending events with the sole purpose of spreading the message of the DAO, ApeCoin & ApeChain. **EDUCATION!**\n\nBelow you will find a list of **several benefits**:\n\n**Targeted Marketing**:\n- Marketing within the web3 space is crucial for a project's success. With Kodama, ApeCoin will reach a relevant and interested audience over the course of several years.\n\n**Increased Reach and Visibility**\n- The Apemobile will polarize and guarantee people’s attention. Kodama will post at least one content piece per week, mainly from Twitter/X account [@kodama_eth](https://twitter.com/kodama_eth), and will generate millions of impressions.\n- He will drive the car daily and visit relevant crypto events/meetups all over Europe, creating additional opportunities for content creation with engaged community members.\n\n**Credibility and Trust**:\n- Kodama has established trust with his followers and has become a relevant KOL within the broader YugaLabs and ApeCoin ecosystem. Having him as a permanent partner endorsing ApeCoin can enhance the brand’s credibility and trustworthiness.\n\n**Content Creation**:\n- Kodama will post at least one content piece per week. Educational, lifestyle, or joining spaces – a broad mix that appeals to different audiences. The goal remains the same: to spread awareness and educate about ApeCoin.\n\n**Cost-Effective Marketing**:\n- Compared to traditional advertising and regular web3 KOL partnerships, this comes at a very low cost. It perfectly complements the recent F1 partnership of the DAO (which opens up many possibilities for further content creation).\n\n**Engagement and Interaction**:\n- The Apemobile will polarize! Kodama will leverage this and foster active engagement with his followers and the broader web3 community.

The Foundation has already begun coordinating to develop our new Snapshot strategy to automate these new decision making guidelines, however, we will ensure compliance with this guideline manually in the interim.*\n\n*This AIP falls above that threshold and will require 69% of votes to be approved.*\n\n### Proposal Description\n\nAlright folks, this is our rebooted AIP-410 ApeCoin Goes to Hollywood —now called:\n\n**ApeCoin Gets a LOUDER Voice: The podcastization of the ApeCoin Ecosystem.**\n\nIt’s a multi-layered AIP to give the ApeCoin ecosystem a voice that reaches the world in multiple languages, improve internal DAO communication, involve ApeCoin holders, help AIP Authors, MBAs, MOCA and artists, use the DAO as a talent marketplace and bring normies and Web3 enthusiasts to ApeChain.\n\nWe want to leverage our 19 years in podcasting and 6 years in Web3.\n\n- **Why podcasts?** Because podcasts are the most direct, natural, and cost-effective way to communicate. That’s why listeners are growing worldwide nonstop.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreigadod6f23ccgmhmiw6y5lvkytnksiti4s4cnsaqgmjkvbabpyrgi)\n*Sources: Statista, Edison Research*\n    \n- **Why Web3?** Because we are true believers since 2018, when we even tried to shake up how presidential elections are held in Mexico (and the world) using Blockchain with great results and media coverage (you can read more in Dany Saadia’s bio); and we’ve come a long way since then. We even snatched up ApeCoin as soon as it was released and minted 2 BAYC (1382 and 1383).\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreib6wno6oxorhsa2ai6bfl5lftnl6wp4nagkcnhqedb7r4ypr6v7ee)\n    \nSo this is why we are resubmitting this AIP with the firm belief we are uniquely qualified to navigate this project to success. Let’s dive:\n\nFirst off, we’re talking about real podcasts, like the ones we've been producing since 2005. You can listen to an example [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5SGGCaBLKF82Cu8dzpLqoe?si=42bb42a465bf4b83). This means: it’s not about just giving mics to a couple of folks or recording Zoom calls. Real podcasts have a story, a script, a production, and they truly harness the power of voice. Since the dawn of time, humans have been wired to respond to voice when it comes with the right words, the right tone, and even the right musicality. Also, podcasts are notably less expensive to produce than video. We’re going to leverage all this to benefit the ApeCoin DAO—the entire ApeCoin ecosystem and all its members.\n\nDown to business: we’ll tackle the internal and external communication issues in the DAO with podcasts to be distributed on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, YouTube, et.al. Out of our own experience, the learning we got from the different Spaces and Discourse comments about the DAO and how you can really make a difference is nothing short of incredible, and massively expands what Ape_U does. However, this experience has really driven home the need to make these discussions accessible to everyone, on-demand, in their own time and time-zone. This is why we are pushing this AIP as follows:\n\n1. **Podcastizing:** edit and post-produce all ApeCoin related Spaces like Apecomms, BOTB, Bodega, Sandbox, Meet at the Clubhouse, Mocaverse and all other relevant Spaces so no one has to hang around, banana to the ear, at crazy hours. (Example: [July 6th BOTB Space](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4XqHCi4yg5JZgbdNZ6LYYa?si=0a79f7020a9c4baf&nd=1&dlsi=b7eaae0fece742f1)).\n\n2. We will also produce and post-produce a **weekly chat-show podcast about ApeCoin and ApeChain news** (live AIPs, ApeChain and DAO updates, testnests, controversies, F1, etc) with key players as guests, all hosted by two DAO members (to be chosen).\n\n3. For **all willing ApeCoin DAO AIP Authors, we’re gonna podcastize your AIP drafts, just like we are doing with this AIP** (listen to it [here](https://open.spotify.com/episode/2hGon9FYaSAjk12gUTCeqy?si=3e4f875fa2c54213&nd=1&dlsi=7ff67936b3e147be)), and we recently did with all Special Council candidates (Listen [here](https://open.spotify.com/show/2TXDNfaWDURb5f4hqPulWI?si=c3ec9fd0e8694ac6&nd=1&dlsi=0b5e58d172a34e84)). This will be done in English, our common language.\n\n4. For all willing MBAs and BAYC & MOCA artists we will produce a 20- to 30-minute podcast about their project, because we know there is an entrepreneurial and enlightening story behind every MBA and artist that deserves to be told and heard.\n\n    - Also, we will produce a 30-second audio ad for all willing MBAs and MOCA artists to promote their product or services that will be baked-in on all podcasts published by this AIP for free. (As long as they follow DAOs guidelines).\n\n5. Then, to increase and amplify **ApeCoin’s visibility** in the normie world, we will write, produce, post-produce and distribute to all major platforms, **TWO “ApeCoin Originals” in three key languages for global distribution: English, Spanish, and French.**\n\n    - **Why in English?** For obvious reasons: it’s the current global lingua franca and where the real monetization market for podcasts lies (the US).\n\n    - **Why in Spanish?** Because there are over 500 million native speakers across 21 countries on 3 continents, and it’s largely an untapped market for ApeCoin.\n\n    - **And in French?** Well, add another 27 countries with about 75 million natives and 200 million more who speak it as an official language, nearly as neglected.\n\nWe’re talking about 700 million potential listeners, plus English worldwide speakers, who would be hearing “This is an ApeCoin Original” and “Powered by ApeCoin” for the first time and many many more times.\n\n**What are the two “ApeCoin Originals”?**\n\n1. **A flagship podcast:** a **documentary** on the saga of Yuga and BAYC, Cryptopunks, ApeCoin, and Animoca Brands. Why? To follow the trend of those podcasts that jumped to VOD platforms (like WeCrashed, Gaslit, The Dropout, etc.) These narratives not only captured the attention of mainstream audiences but also turned complex business sagas into cultural phenomena that captivates millions.\n\n    - This flagship podcast aims to do something similar with the story and synergies between Yuga, Animoca Brands, The Sandbox, ApeCoin, all the way to ApeChain. We want to introduce the general public to the universe of Web3 and our DAOs, demystifying it with an accessible and attractive narrative about how these technologies work and their impact on various aspects of culture and the economy.\n\n    - And above all, we want to **control the narrative**. Controlling the narrative is essential to educate and capture the attention of a skeptical or simply unknowledgeable audiences about what blockchain and the NFT market really involves. We are not just looking to tell a story, but also to establish a clear frame of reference so that the audience understands and appreciates the complexity and beauty of what we are doing. It’s about captivating both who are already believers in Web3 and the normies who still do not know or remain reluctantly on the sidelines.

By ensuring instant payments, confidentiality, and a robust verification system, ApeLance provides a reliable and innovative solution for freelancers and clients worldwide.\n\n\n**The Problem**: Traditional freelance platforms often charge high service fees (up to 40%) and can delay payments for several days or even weeks. Freelancers and clients alike face issues with trust and transparency, as the terms of service and payment processes are controlled by centralized entities. In some regions, payments cannot be received, and transfers do not go through. With Web 3.0, we aim to ensure equal rights and opportunities for everyone across the globe.\n\n\n> ApeLance Competitive Advantages\n ![image](ipfs://bafkreih5t2xvvoekcrxfmziwwhsswionlwgroidkwdccvmxmf6bkqogxt4)    \n\n\n⭐  ApeLance: The Solution\nApeLance leverages smart contracts on ApeChain to automate and secure payment processes. Payments in ApeCoin are instant and transparent, significantly reducing the risk of non-payment or delayed payment. Smart contracts hold funds in escrow and release them upon the completion of predefined milestones, ensuring that both parties fulfill their obligations. Payment delays can disrupt the cash flow for freelancers. By utilizing ApeCoin and smart contracts, ApeLance ensures immediate and secure payments upon task completion, providing financial stability for freelancers.\n\n⭐ Easy Account Creation\nCreating an account on our platform is simple and does not require any personal information. Users can register using their wallet address created on ApeChain or their MOCA ID. This approach ensures that the personal information of both contractors and clients remains confidential, while also enhancing the platform’s usability regardless of the user’s location or background. ApeLance aims to eliminate these biases and create an equal opportunity environment for all users.\n\n⭐ Bid\nBidding allows freelancers to offer their services at competitive rates, ensuring clients receive the best value for their projects. By creating a competitive environment, clients can choose from a range of bids that suit their budget and quality expectations.\n\n⭐ NFT Verification and Badge System\nThe NFT Verification and Badge System is a key feature of ApeLance that allows users to verify their NFTs and receive a badge on their profile. This badge serves as a mark of authenticity and credibility within the ApeLance marketplace. Verified NFT badges provide clients and freelancers with an added layer of trust, knowing they are dealing with genuine members of the NFT community. NFT users can easily find and connect with others who share similar NFTs, fostering a sense of community within the marketplace.\n\n⭐ Conclusion\nApeLance is set to transform the freelance landscape by offering a secure, transparent, and efficient platform powered by blockchain technology. By ensuring instant payments, confidentiality, and a robust verification system, ApeLance provides a reliable and innovative solution for freelancers and clients worldwide.\n \n![image](ipfs://bafkreiarv5ijbvoikmsyfu6nzgbvhkxozqthek4cahgbrukvko766riryy)\n\nFreelancer: An individual who offers their services on a project-by-project basis, often working independently and remotely.  \nClient: An individual or entity that hires freelancers to complete specific projects or tasks.\n\n🌍 Facts about Freelancing Worldwide\n\n▶ Statistics\n\n> Growth: The freelance workforce is growing rapidly, with an estimated 59 million freelancers in the United States alone, contributing $1.2 trillion to the economy. Freelancing is a global phenomenon, with freelancers from around the world offering their services to clients across borders.\n\n\n> Flexibility: One of the main reasons people choose freelancing is the flexibility it offers in terms of work hours, location, and choice of projects. Freelancing allows individuals to have more control over their work-life balance, leading to higher job satisfaction and overall well-being.\n\n\n> Cost-Effectiveness: For companies, hiring freelancers can be more cost-effective than hiring full-time employees, as they only pay for the work done\n\n\n> Speed and Efficiency: Freelancers can often complete projects more quickly and efficiently than traditional employees, as they are highly motivated to deliver quality work. Freelancers bring fresh perspectives and ideas to projects, contributing to innovation within companies.\n\n🪙 Freelance Industry Financial Statistics:\n\n▶ Statistics\n> Revenue Growth: The global freelance market was valued at $1.5 trillion in 2020 and is projected to reach $2.7 trillion by 2028, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2% from 2021 to 2028.\n\n> Regional Revenue Distribution: North America accounted for the largest share of the freelance market revenue in 2020, followed by Europe and Asia-Pacific.\n\n> Sector Contribution: The technology sector is the largest contributor to freelance revenue, followed by design and creative services, and administrative support.\n\n> Freelance Platform Revenue: Online freelance platforms generated $5 billion in revenue in 2020, a significant increase from previous years, driven by the shift to remote work and the gig economy.\n\n_Our goal is to create a blockchain-based P2P freelance platform to capture 0.1% of this rapidly growing market. Unpredictable events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent isolation have demonstrated that people’s lives are not fixed. The next generation dreams of working on diverse projects from anywhere in the world rather than settling in one place._\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidfzngath63vvlyeukvmb6weauzyn4gubxpk425lclboki7eagaa4)\n\n>Increased Utility for ApeCoin\n\nPayment Medium: Using ApeCoin as the primary currency on ApeLance will increase its demand. Freelancers will receive payments in ApeCoin, encouraging them to hold, use, or trade it within the ecosystem. ApeLance will facilitate numerous transactions daily, boosting the transaction volume and liquidity for ApeCoin._\n\nNew User Acquisition: By targeting freelancers and clients globally, ApeLance will attract new users to the ApeCoin ecosystem, including those who have not previously engaged with crypto. ApeLance will encourage active participation from the ApeCoin community, including developers, designers, marketers, and other freelancers, fostering a vibrant and collaborative environment. The platform will help businesses find skilled freelancers quickly and efficiently, driving economic activity within the ApeCoin ecosystem._\n\nNFT Verification: The NFT verification feature will incentivize NFT holders to use and hold ApeCoin, increasing engagement within the ApeCoin ecosystem._\n\nLong-Term Viability: The decentralized and transparent nature of ApeLance ensures its sustainability without reliance on a central authority, aligning with the principles of decentralization and self-sovereignty central to the ApeCoin community._\n\nThe 0.1% of the market we are targeting amounts to $500 million, representing the total sales between employers and employees. We will generate revenue by taking a commission from these transactions.\n\nAccording to our estimates, payments for jobs can be made using all types of coins available on ApeChain, with the commission structure as follows:\n\n- 0.5% marketplace fee will be charged if paying and receiving payments using ApeCoin.\n\n- 1% fee will be charged if payment is made in other coins. \n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreibihvcav4qu5iv3vnlh3rsfh6hxp2mmq44nip4xagenucpaap5ada)\n\nThe 0.5% (ApeCoin) and 1% (other coins) fees would only be collected from the client, ensuring that freelancers receive the full payment for their work. This approach aligns with our goal to attract and retain top talent by maximizing their earnings.\n\nAside from the marketplace fee, the core features of Apelance will be free to use. However, we plan to introduce premium features in the future, such as enhanced profile visibility, advanced project management tools, and access to exclusive job postings. The costs for these premium features are still being finalized and will be competitive with market standards.\n\n### [Please continue reading the rest of this AIP on the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot and Discourse]\n\n### ------------ Important Note for BOTB NFT voters --------------\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Unfortunately, due to the character limit of the BOTB Snapshot, the AIP contents on ApeCoin DAO Snapshot could not be fully duplicated here. \n\nTherefore, please read the full AIP contents on the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot and Discourse before casting your vote on the BOTB Snapshot:\nApeCoin DAO Snapshot link: https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/create/0x708364c923d0cff47f994c39170ed45fce2c6041bd413ffdf3f101d9ef0a911d\n\nhttps://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-472-apelance-web3-freelance-marketplace-on-apechain/24602\n\nThank you very much for your kind understanding.\n\n### IMPORTANT NOTE: The BOTB DAO Snapshot is a mirrored version of the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot.\n\n### Members will vote with BOTB NFTs on our BOTB DAO Snapshot.

The Foundation has already begun coordinating to develop our new Snapshot strategy to automate these new decision making guidelines, however, we will ensure compliance with this guideline manually in the interim.*\n\n*This AIP falls above that threshold and will require 69% of votes to be approved.*\n\n### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThis AIP is designed to showcase the complete scope of the project, including the current build stage of https://www.ip3.cc/\n\nWith a functioning MVP landing page, we require support to accelerate the completion of the product.\n\nThe remaining outstanding items include:\n\n- Build out of the front end UI ensuring complete seamless workflow from user onboarding, through to IP sales and revenue funnels.\n- Backend contracts, although written, require implementation.\n- Backend infrastructure scaling to support system growth.\n- Team scaling for accelerated development to include an additional UI/UX designer and developers continuing through to post deployment support.\n- Contract auditing and security systems require implementation.\n\nIP3.cc allows holders to determine their own IP use for their asset, providing these licenses on an open marketplace for all consumers to be able to purchase, utilizing the IP within the agreed legal parameters. It is a much wider IP use case, providing for greater opportunity; overall increase in brand awareness through increased decentralized IP usage.\n\nFor example: I own a BAYC - I can apply multiple licenses to it allowing for people to lease the right to use the IP for advertising, physical merchandise, comic books, animations etc. Now my asset is accessible to 4 different addressable markets.\n\nThis AIP is focused on increasing the capacity of IP utility, whilst providing the legal framework and monetization structure to support it. As we support all NFT collections, this will positively affect the utility of ApeCoin also.\n\nExternal to product development, it is crucial that this AIP supports the peripheral strategic components that will ensure success:\n\n- Strategic marketing plan and execution\n- Education schedule and material to be delivered to NFT holders\n- Legal Consultation and preparation of agreements, smart contract integration\n- Maintenance and technical infrastructure support\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nIP3.cc provides a robust, scalable IP platform which is dedicated to enhancing the rights and commercialization for NFT holders.\n\nIts legal framework, backed by immutable provenance on the blockchain, will ensure that it is the first and best in class for delivering value back to holders.\n\nAs the payment currency will only be in $ApeCoin, it guarantees that the final payment settlement will always be in $ApeCoin, providing a consistent and balanced tokenomic model which contributes to the whole ecosystem.\n\nWe aim to position IP3.cc as the preferred NFT IP solution and are able to provide the following long term and consistent benefits back to the ApeCoin Ecosystem:\n\n- ApeCoin will be applied in merchandise Market for consistent and available brand awareness.\n- The platform charges 2.5% trading fees for licensing and merchandise Market.\n- All NFT IP listed on Licensing market should pay 1 ApeCoin for each listing.\n\n**Core Benefits to ApeCoin DAO:**\n\n1. 50% of fees generated will be given to ApeCoin DAO in perpetuity.\n2. Licensing fees will be paid in ApeCoin only.\n3. All trading fees within the marketplace will be paid in ApeCoin only.\n4. With IP3 Layer being accessible to all NFT collections on the Ethereum network at first, this enables for a broader adoption and utility of ApeCoin as it will be the only settlement form of payment.\n5. Fiat processing mechanism will be utilized to allow for easy onboarding of new capital with a frictionless payment system.\n\n### OVERALL COST\n\n\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund is 781,000 ApeCoin / $469,000 USD.\n\nBudget:\n\nProduct Development - 240,000 APECOIN\n- UI/UX Design\n- Smart Contract Development\n- Front-end Developer hire\n- Back-end Developer hire\n- Product Design and Management\n- Internal security monitoring and integrity alert system\n\nMarketing - 210,000 APECOIN\n- PR and Media coverage\n- Social media campaigns\n- Joint brand collaborations and campaigns\n\nEducational Packages - 96,000 APECOIN\n- NFT IP Protection\n- IP Licensing Education\n\nLegal & Consultant - 85,000 APECOIN\n\nSecurity - 50,000 APECOIN\n- Smart Contract Audits\n- Platform Security Audits (external)\n\nMaintenance and Support - 100,000 APECOIN\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-481-building-the-modular-ip-layer-with-apecoin/24668\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*\n\n*This AIP falls above that threshold and will require 69% of votes to be approved.*\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE: The BOTB DAO Snapshot is a mirrored version of the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot.\nMembers will vote with BOTB NFTs on our BOTB DAO Snapshot.

Inspired by Times Square and now successfully tested at two major conferences, we plan to expand our innovative and scalable patent-pending model to cities worldwide, in the name of Ape. This proposal includes a 20% equity stake in the venture for the DAO, continues the revenue-sharing royalty from AIP-383, provides free display space to the Ape ecosystem reaching millions of people, and also enables us to activate at four more major Web3 events over the next two years similar to what we recently did at ETH Denver and NFC Lisbon. Additionally, we aim to launch a Public Bored token on ApeChain, providing direct benefits to $APE hodlers. The worst-case scenario of this AIP is we end up owning a reliable, revenue-producing asset that brings continuous value to the DAO.\n\nIn addition to succeeding at ETH Denver and NFC Lisbon this year, The Public Bored ranked 1st out of thousands of applicants in the Founder Program run by prolific angel investor, [Jason Calacanis](https://twitter.com/Jason). This provides us with critical support as we scale into a Series A funding round next year. This AIP provides ApeCoin DAO with early inclusion on all aspects of the venture in order to be positioned longer term for max benefits as the venture scales.\n\nOur model reimagines the global digital billboard industry in the name of Ape. Just as AirBnB and Uber revolutionized the hospitality and taxi industries, The Public Bored aims to transform the digital billboard sector, and to include the ApeCoin DAO on the rewards.\n\nOver the past several months, we’ve tested The Public Bored model with thousands of participants across two major conferences, generated revenue, registered a provisional patent, researched prospective billboard locations, built relationships within the billboard industry, and navigated complex permitting processes through correspondence with various City Halls in major city centers. Additionally, our transparency and accountability reporting have significantly exceeded most other AIPs.\n\nWe envision a future where anyone can display messages or art on any digital billboard worldwide as easily as sending a Tweet. Short term we’ll acquire our first permanently located billboard as a home base of operations, then open our model as a network for other billboard owners to plug into. This AIP enables us to establish that home base of operations to then scale from.\n\nFor perspective; if even 10% of our average daily revenue from the past two events continued throughout a full month as recurring revenue, we would already have exceeded the outdoor billboard industry averages, making us highly attractive to venture funding and providing a viable path to broader scaling. This AIP enables us to acquire that first permanently located digital billboard from which we can launch our network model for other billboard owners, enabling us to reach millions of people worldwide through a profitable model, directly benefiting the DAO Treasury and $APE hodlers alike.\n\nThank you ApeCoin fam, for your unwavering support throughout our activations at ETH Denver and NFC Lisbon.\n\nWe launched this initiative with our own capital, made significant strides with support from AIP-383, and now it’s time for The Public Bored to fly with this Phase 2 proposal.\n\n**Timeline of Historic Events & Accountability Reporting:**\n\n- **Original Forum Posting:**  \n    - [AIP-383: The Public Bored - MVP Launch of a Digital Billboard Network](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-383-the-public-bored-mvp-launch-of-a-digital-billboard-network/21187)\n  \n- **Snapshot Vote:**  \n    - [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0xae1c6774b6973d098855e08566da47b1dbc38e25f346201aefe54c9f0563354b)\n  \n- **First Progress update:**  \n    - [Implementation Update | AIP-383: The Public Bored - MVP Launch of a Digital Billboard Network](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/implementation-update-aip-383-the-public-bored-mvp-launch-of-a-digital-billboard-network/21526)\n  \n- **Second Progress update:**  \n    - [The Public Bored AIP-383 Transparency & Accountability Update 2](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/the-public-bored-aip-383-transparency-accountability-update/23346)\n  \n- **Third Progress update:**  \n    - [The Public Bored AIP-383 Transparency & Accountability Update #3](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/implementation-update-aip-383-the-public-bored-mvp-launch-of-a-digital-billboard-network/21526/2)\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n**Equity and Investment Terms:**\n\n- The ApeCoin ecosystem will receive a 20% equity stake in the venture.\n\n**Ongoing Royalties**\n\n- The ongoing royalty of 1% revenue sharing promised within AIP-383 will continue forward through this Phase 2 AIP as well.\n\n**ApeChain**\n\n- The Public Bored token will launch on ApeChain with direct benefit to $APE hodlers.\n\n**Free Display Space:**\n\n- A portion of display space will be reserved exclusively for the ApeCoin DAO and our network of partners, including $APE hodlers, BAYC/MAYC, Mocaverse, JRNY Club, Otherside, Surreal Guild, Made by Apes brands, Elite Apes, Bored Canada, French Apes, UK Apes, Bulls on the Block, and all ApeCoin Delegates.\n\n**Referral Rewards:**\n\n- A 10% reward will be given to each $APE holder for all referrals who purchase display time on our digital billboards.\n\n**Pay with $APE incentives:**\n\n- Bonus display time will be provided to anyone paying in $APE.\n\n**Ecosystem Recruitment:**\n\n- The Build with $APE page on our website with its corresponding Guide for new AIP authors will be expanded upon, encouraging and helping new builders to join the ApeCoin community.\n\n\n### OVERALL COST\n\n**Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $2.7M paid in $APE**\n\n**Two-Year Budget Allocations as follows:**\n\n**Acquisition of Digital Billboards: $1.7M**\n- Secure up to four permanently located digital billboards through acquisition or new construction.\n\n**Core Team Staffing and Related Expenses: $350k**\n- Build a lean yet effective core team, adhering to LEAN and AGILE principles.\n\n**Marketing & Sales: $200k**\n- Drive engagement and user growth to meet our customer adaption and monthly recurring revenue targets.\n\n**Four Event Activations: $200k**\n- Host four more major events similar to the ETH Denver and NFC Lisbon activations we successfully completed earlier this year.\n\n**Technology Development: $150k**\n- Enhance and innovate the platform’s technology including the launch of our mobile app.\n\n**Legal, Accounting & Professional Fees: $100k**\n- Ensure legal and financial compliance.\n\n**NOTE:**  \nThe Associated costs of each step are variable in nature of negotiations and billboard locations and staffing details.\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-457-the-public-bored-phase-2/24358\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-474: Delegated ApeCoin Community Voting Wallet",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThis proposal is for the creation of a 15M $APE multi-sig “Community Voting Wallet” controlled by members of the DAO community.\n\nThe purpose is for the CVW to be the voting voice of the community without the influence of whale wallets which tend to override the wishes of the community whereby whale wallets vote against the community pulse.\n\nThis mechanic will require a temp check voting period during which the “pulse” of the voting community is based on a “1 wallet = 1 vote” linear voting Snapshot recipe. The results of this voting temp check then determines how the community CVW votes on proposals.\n\nThe period of the delegated wallet will last for a period of ONE YEAR (term) from the date that the wallet is used to vote in any AIP. The term can be renewed if a member puts up an AIP to extend it before the term ends. The newly created delegation cannot be used to vote in any subsequent vote concerning its own delegation (e.g., a vote to renew, a vote to end the delegation early, etc.).\n\n**Background Overview**\n\n- Despite the size of the ApeCoin community, a few whale (1M+ $APE) wallets control the outcome of most proposals up for vote.\n\n- In fact, the majority of token holders don’t actually participate in the DAO voting system.\n\n- The voting turnout continues to decline because, as in real-life, the general consensus among voters is that they can’t be bothered because they know that their vote isn’t likely to count.\n\n- In the June 2024 period alone, the average voting turnout for all AIPs was **189** (!)\n\n- The introduction of the Horizen wallet in the voting system last October has thus far created a polarizing effect whereby, at **4.3M $APE**, it is now the 2nd largest voting wallet next to the Mocaverse (delegated by Animoca) at **6.3M $APE**. And due to the turnout of the voters, these two wallets control the outcome for **every vote** in the DAO.\n\n- The effects of whale voting wallets controlling the outcome of the DAO voting is a centralized paradigm that is outside the realms of decentralization, trust, and fairness.\n\n- Putting caps on a voting wallet isn’t the answer as that will just lead to Sybil solutions whereby that same wallet can be split into amounts below the cap, then all vote anyway.\n\n- The Ape Foundation, acting at the behest of the DAO, has an obligation to ensure that each member of the DAO has a voice, and that the voting system is fair and equitable to all.\n\nSee also: [Special Council To Propose Voting System Reform](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-471-special-council-to-propose-voting-system-reform/24543)\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThis initiative ensures that the DAO community voting, via this proposal, is fairly representative of the wishes of the community.\n\nIt can also dramatically reduce - even eliminate - the influence of whale wallets in the DAO voting system.\n\nThis community temp check Snapshot voting system is similar to the [For|Against ApeChain](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0xe26b5ec8c8d1d03c9ba5b4c53e8d9aa1dc38d2f4b6c44dd9c41643b11fb2b645) vote which came ahead of the final AIP vote for the selected team to build ApeChain.\n\n### OVERALL COST\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 0 ApeCoin\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-474-delegated-apecoin-community-voting-wallet/24629\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*\n\n### IMPORTANT NOTE: The BOTB DAO Snapshot is a mirrored version of the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot.\n\n### Members will vote with BOTB NFTs on our BOTB DAO Snapshot.

      "content": "*Disclaimer: Due to the recent approval of AIP-436, all AIPs requesting an allocation denominated over US$250,000 will require a super majority approval of 69% of the total number of votes cast. The Foundation has already begun coordinating to develop our new Snapshot strategy to automate these new decision making guidelines, however, we will ensure compliance with this guideline manually in the interim.*\n\n*This AIP falls above that threshold and will require 69% of votes to be approved.*\n\n### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Otherside-Wiki Team is reaching out to the Apecoin DAO for **support in our ongoing operations**, as well as in the **further development**, integration into **ApeChain** and **enhancement** of our platform. Our goal is to update Otherside-Wiki to align with contemporary web standards and to **significantly enhance the user experience**.\n\nSince its inception on May 15th, 2022, following the mint of Otherside, we have been working to **improve and evolve** the platform. Our coverage and support extend to **all developments** within Otherside and ApeChain, with our priority being to provide **timely updates** and serve as a pivotal resource for the community.\n\nOtherside Wiki was developed by our lead developer Frostyz. With additional **funding from current investors and ApeCoin DAO**, we plan to further expand the platform by bringing on board **more developers** who have specialized expertise. This expansion will **improve our capacity for growth** and ensure that the platform can thrive with a more diverse team of developers.\n\nWe have developed and enriched the experience for Otherside Users **significantly**, and also improved the **filter experience on marketplaces**. Within this we drove **additional revenue** to Yuga Labs and its partners, provided **deep knowledge** and **data** connected to Otherside, and enriched our platform with **extensive deep data**.\n\nCurrently **we are the go to platform for Otherside data**, marketplace browsing and information. To back this up with figures, last month we reached about **57k unique monthly visitors**, which have an average engagement time of **20 minutes each**, all completely through **organic marketing** and **natural demand**.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafkreihzdguhzgpm5e5tm3nudgcunyf2nucmcto6p5zb6bkx6jdmizzg24)\nFor two years, we have developed Otherside-Wiki at our own expense, without focusing on monetization. Our priority is to provide the **best possible information** to Otherside participants. In order to realize this and **remain independent**, financial support came from us, the founders, as well as **contributions** from Sky is the Limit Ventures and nix.eth.\n\nWe **integrate and enhance** the following topics with our funding request:\n\n1. **General Overhaul of our UI AND UX Design:** As we grew our UI and UX has become outdated. We’re planning to modernize it significantly to meet current web standards.\n\n2. **Modern Web Technologies:** As we’re expecting a bright future for ApeChain & Otherside, we want to be able to **scale for millions of users**. We want to have a solid system using current standards such as Laravel & VueJS using serverless scaling technologies so we can **focus on building the tech and not maintaining the servers**. Using standards also makes sure the website **is no longer dependent on a single person**.\n\n3. **Tailored Data Streams:** Dealing with the **large number** of projects and news in the Otherside/Apecoin ecosystem can indeed be **overwhelming**. To address this, our platform is developing a **major feature**—an entirely personalized Apecoin/Gaming feed. We want to aggregate data and information from various platforms and community initiatives into **one coherent stream**.  \n   Users will have the flexibility to **customize** this feed to align with their specific interests and preferences.\n\n4. **Deep Insights:** We will continue to **provide and expand** our deep data insights into ApeChain and Otherside. Our goal is to support a **growing number of games** on ApeChain and provide valuable **in-depth insights**.\n\n5. **Multilingual Support:** To better serve the **global community**, we plan to add support in two of the world’s **most widely spoken languages**, **Chinese** and **Spanish**, in addition to English.\n\nWe carefully considered the timing of our AIP application with Apecoin and chose to proceed only when it became truly **necessary**. Given the unforeseen delays in the launch of Otherside, and the postponement of release dates, we believe now is the critical moment for this **support**. This funding will ensure the **continued development** and success of Otherside-Wiki, maintaining our commitment to keeping the platform **predominantly free** while preparing for a more comprehensive business model post-launch of Otherside.\n\n**Note from Agora-Marketplace.eth (SITL Ventures):** In the last 2 years we’ve invested around **1,000 ETH** in Otherside related assets and also funded together with nix.eth the first 2 years of operation for Otherside-Wiki. Hereby we’re committing another investment of **$300,000 USD** to cover a part of the development costs. For us it’s a risk to do a follow-up round while seeing Otherside delays. Therefore we would like to see a **positive response** on this proposal from the community to ensure all together another **2 years of operation + improvements** for Otherside-Wiki.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeia24522ioa6ab2ricupdjwoaz5rr7qeh7kye7hklzka5iqnh2ob6u)\n\n### Partnerships & Integrations\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeidkcasoyv6lzxu2xatfujh3sx7l34x7hjms7vypyiim6br6wdv37a)\n    \n**Faraway**  \nAfter the acquisition of the assets of Kodamara, Mara and HV-MTL as part of Faraway, we have built a strong partnership with them. Together we have developed a tool that enables users to visualize future points within the Faraway ecosystem.\n\n**Otherpage**  \nWe have established a crosslinking partnership with Otherpage, enhancing visibility and exposure for both parties across our platforms.\n\n**Zharta**  \nAs early supporters of Zharta, we have integrated their digital asset rental protocol into our platform. In return, Zharta provides crosslinks from their website to our asset pages.\n\n**Inceptive Studio (in progress)**  \nWe are partnering with Inceptive Studio to seamlessly integrate our data and feeds into Otherside/Improbable.\n\n**Integrations**\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeifqiuwuth5zmwbv3dvjhwqcu7lm4qfhja4nha5imxc5kckromushi)\n\n- **ApeCoin:**  \n  We provide insights into the DAO and gaming activities related to ApeCoin, particularly within Faraway and Yuga Labs games.\n\n- **Marketplaces:**  \n  Our platform integrates listings from all major marketplaces, including Magic Eden, OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2, and the ApeCoin Marketplace.\n\n- **Legends of the Mara / HV-MTL by Yuga Labs:**  \n  We actively support every game developed and published by Yuga Labs. Our platform was the first to offer detailed insights and link on-chain data with in-game data.\n\n**Partners**\n\n- **Rocketcode:**  \n  Our trusted development partner, providing additional developer resources as needed for various features.\n\n- **Pixelrebel:**  \n  Our go-to partner for graphical implementations and visual enhancements.\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n**Otherside and Apecoin Integration**\n\n**Otherside** will be the cornerstone use case for the Apecoin ecosystem. Our commitment to Apecoin integration not only expands its visibility but also solidifies its utility on our platform. As we roll out premium tools and features, we will exclusively use Apecoin as our accepted currency.\n\nBy supporting us, the Apecoin DAO & Community will benefit in several ways:\n\n1. **Apecoin as Currency:**  \n  With the introduction of advanced features and tools, all microtransactions within our platform will utilize Apecoin, particularly for transactions related to our data feed.\n\n2. **ApeChain as Platform:**  \n  Within the rollout of ApeChain, we will be one of the first DAPPs to actively support ApeChain.\n\n3. **Game Integration:**  \n  We will actively support and integrate games that have achieved significant popularity, further enhancing our platform’s ecosystem.\n\n4. **Merge of Data:**  \n  Our personalized Apecoin/Gaming Feed will consolidate data from various platforms and community initiatives into a single, streamlined personalized user experience.\n\nBy increasing the adoption and utility of Apecoin, our platform will not only serve as a dynamic showcase for the potential of Apecoin but will also motivate other developers and platforms to adopt Apecoin.\n\n### OVERALL COST\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $715,000 - to be paid in $APE\n\nSky is the Limit Ventures has committed additional $300k for development upon approval of the AIP.

Coordinating with multiple IP brands, especially around major conferences, is arduous. Sending products, particularly internationally, is costly and time-consuming. High-profile events are often too expensive for a single IP brand to justify.\n\nRecognizing the collective strength of the community with the launch of the MBA program, Jason co-founded BoredIn, a subcommunity supporting 200 MBAs founders building together. BoredIn focuses on spotlighting and aggregating IP brands and product media and research. Feedback from numerous IP brands & BoredIn highlighted the following major challenges:\n\n1. **Poor Visibility:** Limited visibility and awareness outside Web3. While Web3 thrives on platforms like X, web2 consumers are on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok where there has yet to be an incentivisation of customers, buyers, influencers to drive content.\n2. **Limited Resources:** Small IP brands struggle with time and money, even for essential functions like shipping, where commercial rates are 35-60% below published rates.\n3. **Distribution Challenges:** Scaling distribution for large order volumes or international shipments is challenging.\n4. **Payments Barriers:** Accepting crypto for E-commerce is challenging to set up and expensive with gas fees. Although there are some solutions for Shopify for an online store, there are no known solutions for in real life point of sale (POS) solutions which include ApeCoin and ApeChain. We plan to work with NiftyKit and other tech partners to help develop. \n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeidrp2pdyub6o7xzmuhsromxgvjbpf4uxf44knnor6ciypo4h4fwoq)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeifttz7pucdgyg7sho7q6l6bos6vnwb5tvcko5zt26v74zmpm4byqm)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeifpbxnsgssr7dt3wdj7eh5bghqikzokmwj4vguufgunsisqr3ahca)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeifhkrbcythfqhbnv32bfayw2fa7lfjn2e53qh7mjkvwx6brdktckm)\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeiclhsrneaqchhtx5kzt3s3zb2774bquwfpxzog2hjusn5qwjrvh3q)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeif62sn32ldha7mwsnwk2jga2pahknwmp2u2v7bcezjq4xwsf3wiha)\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafybeihqskbaok242uvld7yrxkpwunxub2bb3nmxywg37o5a73jr4npegi)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeibjvjiff2ib3fk2bi7zieyjfp5suymrolg5qy5225fpi3fvmw23lu)\n    \n![image](ipfs://bafybeigsyvdxs3t5f3u2wvrsmetsd5vb7jwurooyunqeutgsaw4mnnl2sa)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeiffrozgxj6nmzzj4wgry6rptfqa53djj5ymxlz3awc4aofd4xjkxe)\n  \n![image](ipfs://bafybeigce2cpi2xn5omb362hjnxiybm6kkabjlpfehkkbunhtkrjn2mnsq)\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeihi2e3v5tct7ocm7oezg272afu7ckakaleewy2g2bdy4trax7kvqa)\n                                   \n**Bored Trading Co’s Strategy**\n\nBored Trading Co is dedicated to addressing key challenges in scaling IP products to the masses by creating a consumer flywheel. We believe in a collective approach to help the entire ecosystem overcome challenges. Our mission is to deliver value back to the ApeCoin and ApeChain ecosystems, fostering innovation and growth within the community. We aim to create IP products with ApeCoin holders, expanding the IP ecosystem. With Web3 IP products still in their infancy, many brands need support to scale, particularly in garnering visibility and driving smaller brands. Leveraging our logistics expertise, including @NFThoarder888’s experience as the Head of America’s Logistics at Bloomberg where he was responsible for thousands of events and conferences. In web3, we’ve supported numerous IP brands at major events (e.g. HK Apefest and Dubai Token) and collaborated on curated IP boxes (e.g. F*ck It Saturday and @WelcomeApes MBA box). Our journey includes expanding to communities like Pudgies, Mocaverse, 10KT, Azuki, and many more to empower and grow the entire ecosystem.\n\nE-commerce presents a clear opportunity for ApeCoin to drive utility to the masses given current spending and growth projections. Bored Trading Co aims to harness the collective IP ecosystem to drive awareness, interest, and consideration from D2C consumers and B2B buyers. Bored Trading Co’s strategy includes a multi-pronged approach:\n\n- **Event Targeting**: Participating in events with a booth to create direct engagement. Attend conventions and tradeshows to dive brand awareness for ApeCoin, ApeChain, and IP brands.\n\n- **Curated Box/Bag Solutions**: Offering flexible, ApeCoin Powered curated products to customers and influencers to increase brand visibility. Incentivize collaboration between brands and ApeCoin to enhance the ApeCoin ecosystem development and culture. The bundling of several IP products together and centralization of fulfillment allows for higher conversion since the shipping cost does not create an imbalance to the customer value proposition. In web2 the higher dollar per transaction allows for promotions with free shopping or % off when you spend over a certain amount. The lower cost structure will provide custoers with more value at a lower price. We can curate multiple boxes like snack , gifting, or seasonal boxes.\n\n- **Community and Influencer Engagement**: Driving content creation and engagement rewards to maintain sustained contact and recurrent touchpoints, adhering to the marketing “rule of seven.” Encourage users to hold 1 Ape, which gives them the opportunity to participate in events, receive corresponding tickets, ApeCoin Powered curated IP box, and discounts for online purchases.\n\n- **IP Engagement**: Encourage brands to collaborate with ApeCoin, thereby fostering the growth and development of the ApeCoin ecosystem. Through collaboration with MBAs, incentivize MBAs and IP brands to join the Powered by ApeCoin ecosystem. Reduce the barrier entry for MBAs. \n\nAs we curate Powered by ApeCoin IP products, we will consider all previously approved AIPs and ApeCoin holders to include ApeCoin community IP in purchasing ApeCoin Powered curated boxes and bags. Additionally, the ApeCoin community will be rewarded through an ApeCain loyalty program for creating engaging content, such as unboxing videos, GIFs, and memes, to amplify product and “ApeCoin Powered” presence on Instagram and TikTok. ThankApe recently launched their BBAC Accelerator program which was celebrated by the community and we are looking to build off of this momentum and address the broader ecommerce flywheel out to web2 meeting consumers where they are outside of crypto Twitter. We will build our infrastructure to help the 30 winners of the BBAC while scaling to support the long tail of other businesses not rewarded. As ThankApe is a partner, we will work with them closely to further the impact and benefit to the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\n**NFT NYC Case Study**\n\nWe piloted the booth solution at NFT NYC during three events: NotNFTNYC, Clubhouse, and Bored Brunch, showcasing 13 IP products. The Bored Trading Co.’s booth drove conversation, inspiration, and even a couple of transactions. Rising tides lift all boats, and the AIP will allow us to scale this program with technology to accept $APE for onsite payments during events and support ApeChain in the future.\n\nIn addition, ApeCoin Powered curated boxes and bags with IP products will be deployed for smaller events and promotion to VIPs and influencers. Individuals and communities will be able to purchase curated boxes and bags directly from our e-commerce site. We will have a limited presales drop of the curated box(es) to drive revenue and accessibility. Ultimately, the goal is to drive leads from events back to the IP brands. Bored Trading Co. will help facilitate B2B leads with a 5% fee to support the financial sustainability of the project.\n\nBored Trading Co.’s holistic application of this strategy aims to garner attention and drive leads, ensuring a successful expansion from Web3 into the broader web2 e-commerce space. Together, Bored Trading Co. and its partners are set to break the glass ceiling and build a thriving IP ecosystem with ApeCoin & ApeChain, sparking an e-commerce consumer flywheel. The socialfi campaign and Powered by ApeCoin curated boxes will capture attention to expand the top of funnel, and the Bored Trading Co. booth at events will amplify brand awareness and leads.\n\n**Platforms and Technology**\n\n### [Please continue reading the rest of this AIP on the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot and Discourse]\n\n### ------------ Important Note for BOTB NFT voters --------------\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Unfortunately, due to the character limit of the BOTB Snapshot, the AIP contents on ApeCoin DAO Snapshot could not be fully duplicated here. \n\n### Therefore, please read the full AIP contents on the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot and Discourse before casting your vote on the BOTB Snapshot:\nApeCoin DAO Snapshot link: https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/create/0x51f01524c4e2dbf2608308757bce38a19432eedbd51c9c019ff8ea376654a768\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-468-bored-trading-co-powered-by-apecoin/24512\n\nThank you very much for your kind understanding.\n\n### IMPORTANT NOTE: The BOTB DAO Snapshot is a mirrored version of the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot.\n\n### Members will vote with BOTB NFTs on our BOTB DAO Snapshot.

      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\nThis proposal aims to allocate 13.8 Million ApeCoin in voting power to better reflect the contributions and stakes of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), Kodas, and Otherdeed holders within our community. We aim to create a more balanced and representative governance. We aim to create two distinct wallets; one for the monkees and one for the Kodas and the Deeds they keep watch over.\n\nThe Ape Wallet will have 6.9 million ApeCoin delegated to it by The Ape Foundation. The vote will be controlled by BAYC (2 votes) and MAYC (1 vote) via snapshot.\n\nThe Otherside Wallet will have 6.9 million ApeCoin delegated to it and will be controlled by Koda (2 votes) and Otherdeed Expanded holders (1 vote)\n\n- _This delegation will have a one-year term starting from the date that the wallets are used to vote in any AIP. The term can be renewed if a member puts up an AIP to extend it before the term ends. However, these delegations will not be used to vote in any subsequent decisions related to them, such as renewing, extending, or ending it early._\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe proposed voting adjustment aims to empower those who were intended to lead The Otherside. This change is designed to foster a fairer voting environment, promoting decisions that benefit the broader community and support the long-term health of the ecosystem.

Period.**\nIt’s not easy to stand out and get the attention of people nowadays… so, we need guerrilla marketing.\n\n**Guerrilla marketing** is a highly effective strategy due to its ability to deliver high impact at a low cost. By leveraging the psychological impact and viral nature of unconventional tactics, it has the ability to generate significant buzz and engagement.\n\n**KOL partnerships and brand ambassadorships** are a proven model in web3 and are widely adopted by top-tier projects in this space. To date, ApeCoin does not have a single partnership of this kind.\n\nThis AIP offers a bold mix of the above mentioned :muscle:\n\nEducational content and marketing by kodama.eth - amplified by the Apemobile!\n\nAn ApeCoin branded all-black Porsche 911 Carrera 4s.\nCustom license plate - APE 911.\nApeCoin logo on the tank cap.\n“Powered by ApeCoin” branding on the side, in the classic Porsche style.\n\nThe car will be called Apemobile and will be established as status symbol of success within the whole web3 space. Leveraged by a multi-year partnership with web3 KOL kodama.eth and the targeted use of guerilla marketing tactics in order to amplify **educational content around the DAO, ApeCoin & ApeChain.**\n\n**The car will be a tool to polarize and get attention.**\n\nThink about how many ppl will join a spaces called “How I got a Porsche 911 from the ApeCoin DAO”.\n\n**In an endless X feed you need to stand out.** You need to grab the attention and once you have it, you use it to educate and make them one of us :wink:\n\nNOTE: The Apemobile can be leveraged by the whole community. Not just kodama.\n\nThe pictures can be used by everyone.\n\nThe AIP author will work closely with the Marketing and Communications working group, who have the option to opt-in to particpate, to maximize the benefits of this initiative.\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n**A multi-year partnership with kodama.eth, web3 KOL**\n\nKodama has a large, engaged following within the web3 community.

Having him as a permanent partner endorsing ApeCoin can enhance the brand’s credibility and trustworthiness.\n\n**Content Creation:**\n\n- Kodama will post at least one content piece per week. Educational, lifestyle or joining spaces - a broad mix that appeals to different audiences. The goal remains the same - to spread awareness and to educate about ApeCoin.\n\n**Cost-Effective Marketing:**\n\n- Compared to traditional advertising and regular web3 KOL partnerships this comes at a very low cost. It perfectly complements the recent F1 partnership of the DAO (which btw opens up many possibilities for further content creation).\n\n**Engagement and Interaction:**\n\n- The Apemobile will polarize! Kodama will leverage this and foster active engagement with his followers and the broader web3 community. This will lead to higher interaction rates for the campaign and increased brand visibility.\n\n**Authenticity:**\n\n- Kodama will share personal stories and experiences, which will make his endorsements feel more genuine and relatable compared to traditional ads.\n\n**Rapid Awareness and Virality:**\n\n- The Apemobile has the potential to go viral quickly. It can create a buzz around ApeCoin and ApeChain. Imagine a post starting with “WTF I really got a Porsche 911 from the ApeCoin DAO”\n\n**Diversified Marketing Strategy:**\n\n- Working with kodama adds another layer to ApeCoins marketing strategy, diversifying the current approach and helping Ape reach potential new users/buyers.\n\n**Long-Term Partnership:**\n\n- Building a long-term relationships with kodama will result in continuous exposure for the ApeCoin brand.\n\n**Why Guerilla Marketing for ApeCoin?**\n\n- Proven Concept\n- Cost Efficiency\n- Brand Differentiation\n- Psychological Impact\n- High Engagement\n- Viral Potential\n\nGuerrilla marketing is a must-do for every businesses aiming to maximize their marketing impact while minimizing costs.

Scheduled for the 14th and 15th of September 2024, this prestigious event will be held at the esteemed KL Base Jalan Sungai Besi (“KL Base”), situated in the heart of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Notably, KL Base has been designated as a key tourism destination, promoted jointly by the Ministry of Tourism, Arts & Culture (“Ministry of Tourism” or “Government”) and the Ministry of Finance of the Malaysian Government. In addition to KL Base, we have received invitations from several other prominent event venues and are currently in the process of negotiating terms with these parties to secure the optimal location for the MY Token event.\n\nMY Token is the first Web3 event in Malaysia endorsed by the Ministry of Tourism. Working together with the government, the team aims to collaborate with various Asian NFTs & Blockchain communities to create an iconic Web3 event in Malaysia.\n\nThis proposal seeks to collaborate with ApeCoin DAO by providing sponsorship for speaking engagements, a dedicated booth presence, mascot integration, and support for engaging side events during the conference.\n\n![image](ipfs://bafybeia5yekdlmuxmggva3rtk6ora5quqnang37eivufflvg2ksvzzzq7q)\n![image](ipfs://bafybeig6vm2vza4vdhxko624xgtkpxjch262shpslbaj2pbhokvlxro2m4)\nEVENT DETAILS\n\nMY Token is the main event introducing the first large-scale WEB3 event in Malaysia.

      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThis AIP proposes a modification to the ApeCoin DAO’s decision-making process by requiring a super majority vote for any proposal that involves spending or allocating more than USD two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) of DAO resources. A super majority, for the purposes of this AIP, is defined as at least 69% of the total number of tokens cast during voting in favor of the proposal without consideration of any abstained votes. In the case of proposals with funding requests designated in $APE (or any other non-USD denomination), a USD-value determination must be made during the review period prior to the voting phase, and to be clarified for the community under the Overall Cost section of the relevant proposals.\n\nThis passing of this proposal would constitute a material change to [AIP-1](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-1-proposing-the-dao-process/39) (notably Phase 7 of the AIP Process) and [AIP-2](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-2-voting-process/41).\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n1. Enhanced Financial Stewardship: Ensures that large financial decisions have broader community support, reflecting a higher consensus and reducing risks.\n2. Increased Community Engagement: Encourages a more active participation from the community, knowing their input is crucial for major financial decisions.\n3. Risk Mitigation: Mitigates financial risk by ensuring substantial financial allocations are thoroughly vetted and widely supported within the community.\n4. Transparency and Trust: Builds greater trust and transparency within the community, as significant financial decisions require clear and convincing support.\n\n### OVERALL COST\n\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $0.\n\nThe APE Foundation will be responsible for determining which AIPs qualify for the supermajority vote and communicating that to the ApeCoin DAO community, as well as properly setting this up for Snapshot.\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-436-enhancing-financial-decision-making-with-super-majority-voting-of-69-for-allocations-over-us-250-000/23705\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-446: MineApes: ApeCoin in Minecraft, engage new people and learn about Apes",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\nThe initiative aims to support the ApeCoin Ecosystem by the creation of a unique Minecraft Server that will expose ApeCoin to different Web2/Web3 users. The Minecraft Roleplay experience we will realize, combines learning about blockchain and cryptocurrency concepts with the fun and interactivity typical of Minecraft. This server is a multiplayer experience where different players undertake specific roles and interact with one another within a virtual world in a story or narrative context. It’s an interactive environment where players could be creative, develop unique characters, and engage in gripping stories with others in the community.\n\nPlayers will embark on their journey from ground zero, starting with neither money nor personal property. They will need to seek their first job or opt for education to acquire skills, subsequently advancing towards employment.\n\nNumerous job opportunities await players, ranging from mining and entrepreneurship to political roles or positions within the government sector. Essential roles such as doctors, nurses, firefighters, and policemen are also available.\n\nThere are many objectives in such a comprehensive mode, but we have summarized the main ones. We aim for a serene environment, free of disparities and conflicts among users.\n\n- Explore: an unique world\n- Learn: about Apes & Web3\n- Build: your in-game future\n- Socialize: meet new e-friends\n\nOur team-created virtual city is the hub of adventure for all players. From here, they are taken into a world full of opportunities starting with Town Hall as a common starting point. From schools to hospitals and museums, recreational parks, and much more, we promise varied gaming experiences with a wide variety of core buildings.\n\nBut it doesn’t stop there: the extremities of the town provide limitless plots for buying, selling, and renting—a never-ending expansion. Underneath the surface, there would be subway stations and markets, bringing another dimension to the game: discovery. Then comes the aspect where players can make their mark in the game by creating their own home or business.\n\nThe academy system is dedicated to both enlightening people on Web3 as well as exploring the intriguing origins of Bored Ape, discovering the history of the foundation and about who the founders are.\n\nWe are building our custom launcher with our “Pentagon Games” Gamemodes too. The ApeCoin’s Server will be also integrated under our launcher. Being included under our ecosystem guarantee different benefits:\n\n- The Pentagon Game launcher provides APE members with the opportunity to install the game and gain early access, along with exclusive special skins\n\n- Access other Minecraft gamemodes we’ve created in a multiverse experience\n\n- Players can earn the opportunity to have their specific APEs erected as statues. This recognition comes with on-chain airdrops and other perks for users, such as the ability to fly around for 5 minutes\n\n- Users can earn sponsored gas tokens from multiple blockchain networks, including both EVM-compatible and non-EVM chains, as they explore the platform and develop their profiles\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n- Themed Digital World: We will create an Ape-themed digital space where anyone can come in, have fun and spend their time in an engaging environment\n\n- Educational Opportunities: We will provide learning opportunities for people and awareness about Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Web3, Metaverse and more\n\n- Media Success: Thanks to Minecraft, the best-selling game in recent years, we will gain significant media attention that will give even more visibility to ApeCoin\n\n- Knowledge: We will make the ApeCoin story known to all possible users, increasing brand recognition and understanding\n\n- Increased Usership and Adoption: Integrating ApeCoin as a game currency will incentivize players to use and own ApeCoin, increasing adoption and demand for the cryptocurrency (this Benefit will happen in the future when the gamemode is released on Hytopia)\n\n- Active and Involved Community: Creating an active and involved community around ApeCoin, with events, competitions, and activities that promote interaction and a sense of belonging\n\n- Monetization and Revenue: Generating new revenue streams through in-game purchases, special events, and other activities using ApeCoin, supporting the economic sustainability of the project\n\n### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $111,250.00\n\nThis proposal requests an allocation of $APE tokens equivalent to $111,250 USD to cover the entire cost of the development and Pentagon Games (and Versadia) operational fees for the first six months.\n\nJava Development - $31.500,00\nMinecraft Builders - $22.000,00\nModelling - $8.250,00\nMarketing - $13.500,00\nOperation Cost - $36.000,00 for the first six months ($6.000 per month)\n\nTeam members:\n\n2 Project Managers\n3 Artists / Video Makers\n3 Modellers\n8 Builders\n5 Developers\n\n### PROPOSAL\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-446-mineapes-apecoin-in-minecraft-engage-new-people-and-learn-about-apes/24041\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\n\nThis proposal suggests shortening and standardizing the voting cycle for Ape Improvement Proposals (AIPs) in the ApeCoin ecosystem. The proposed changes include reducing the voting period from 13 days back to 6 days and establishing a voting schedule that starts every Thursday at 1pm UTC (6am PST/9am EST/9pm HKT) and ends every Wednesday at 1pm UTC (6am PST/9am EST/9pm HKT). The assignment of AIP ID numbers would take place after proposals have been approved to move on to the Live voting stage, aiming to increase the value of each AIP ID # for accepted authors. Additionally, this proposal suggests making the mandatory 7-day AIP Idea phase optional for all authors, removing any period of time where proposals may be closed for community discussion, clarifying that critical community discussion and material updates to proposals are still expected to occur during all phases of the AIP process.\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe aim is to reduce friction in the AIP process and better accommodate the global nature of the DAO.\n\nStreamlining the AIP Process would help to expedite community decision-making processes, enabling the community to react more quickly to changes in the ecosystem and decide on accepting new proposals.\nEstablishing a fixed voting schedule rooted in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) would enhance predictability and consistency, making it easier for community members to engage in the governance process.\nPreventing AIP Ideas from closing after the initial 7-day feedback window would allow the community to engage openly with the AIP author throughout the entire AIP process.\nMaking the AIP Idea phase optional would provide flexibility for the ApeCoin DAO, while ensuring that critical community discussion can still take place during the Draft stage.\nImproving efficiency in the assignment of AIP ID numbers would help to preserve community resources, reduce risks to the ApeCoin brand, and increase the perceived value of AIP ID numbers.\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \n\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 0\n\nInstead, the proposal requests that the Ape Foundation would implement the proposed updates to the voting cycle as soon as possible.\n\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-451-improving-voting-cycle-efficiency-and-shortening-the-aip-process/23632\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-442: Grant Ships: Accelerating ApeCoin’s Ecosystem Evolution",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION\n\nGrant Ships: Accelerating ApeCoin Ecosystem Evolution aka “Ape Ships” is a proposed grants funding game specifically for ApeCoin DAO in support of ApeChain ecosystem development. The Grant Ships game is an “evolutionary grants meta-framework” that lets a DAO choose multiple teams of grant allocators (aka ‘Grant Ship Operators’) who compete to best allocate funds within a given domain.\n\nThis proposal is to fund 1 round of the Grant Ships game with the option to fund future rounds if the DAO likes the program. The Grant Ships platform provides a dynamic, transparent, onchain and community-driven funding initiative customized for the ApeCoin ecosystem to strategically fund sectors critical for the growth of ApeChain. This process will help ApeCoin DAO discover and empower the best allocators and the best projects aligned with their mission.\n\nThe Grant Ships game is at its heart a smart-contract-enforced governance system for grants programs. This means that the Grant Ships game has a clear ruleset and governance pathway where every in-game interaction is backed by an onchain transaction.\n\nApeCoin holders are involved at key junctures to ensure appropriate voter influence on outcomes without creating voter overwhelm or fatigue. DAO Voters influence funding direction primarily through Ship Operator and Game Facilitator elections and periodic TCR-gated Ship Operator portfolio reviews — the results of which determine relative Ship funding levels going forward.\n\nUnder the hood, Grant Ships uses Allo Protocol and Hats Protocol to provide reliable and flexible funding with revokable permissions — ensuring the DAO maintains control of the funds earmarked for grant allocation. All transactions and governance actions are recorded on-chain and presented publicly, fostering an environment of transparency, accountability and trust.\n\nAdditionally, the game can be played without the competitive aspect, serving as an open, transparent grant distribution protocol. Funding can be given to any group to distribute as grants using the app, ensuring all steps are open and available to DAO members.\n\nGrant Ships: Accelerating ApeCoin’s Ecosystem Evolution aims to create a sustainable and scalable funding model that grows with ApeChain, supporting its development into a premier blockchain ecosystem.\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n* Enhanced Community Governance:\n    * Voter Engagement: One of the goals of Grant Ships is to identify skilled allocators and empower them with the necessary tools to make effective funding decisions. The DAO has the opportunity to elect individuals or teams they believe will excel in these roles. A DAO vote also determines relative Ship funding levels for subsequent rounds.\n        * Candidates are encouraged to self-nominate and actively campaign for their preferred roles. The election process will be facilitated through on-chain multi-choice voting, leveraging ApeCoin. To accommodate this, the creation of an additional module may be required to enable ApeCoin’s integration into the voting mechanism. The positions available for election are Facilitators and Ship Operators. Additionally, these roles may be appointed directly by the DAO’s councils if deemed more suitable for the DAO’s needs.\n    * Feedback: Every in-game action is recorded onchain and can be verified by any member of the DAO. This data provides the DAO with all the information needed to make informed decisions about how to run the game (e.g. ship funding and administrator elections).\n\n* Targeted Ecosystem Growth:\n    * Focused Funding Rounds: This proposal describes a funding round description that instructs Ship Operators and Grant Applicants to support the growth of ApeChain by funding and creating projects that fall the following categories:\n        * Infrastructure - ApeChain tools, protocols, frameworks, etc.\n        * DeFi - Financial platforms and initiatives\n        * Gaming - onchain game loops, NFT collections, etc.\n        * Other - the unexpected and creative\n    * Adaptive Domain Allocation: The DAO retains the flexibility to adjust the focus of future funding rounds based on emerging strategic needs.\n    * Community Driven: The Grant Ships framework allows every DAO member to influence funding decisions without frequent votes or the need to gain massive context before every voting.\n\n* Competitive Excellence:\n    * Performance-Based Funding: Our model incentivizes high performance among grant allocators by directly linking their funding to demonstrated impact of their grants. This meritocratic approach encourages each Ship to strive for excellence. The better the results they deliver relative to the other Ships, the more funding they receive. This encourages a continuous drive for improvement and innovation.\n        * Grant allocators verify the completion of funding-related milestones through a multi-step process. Initially, projects outline their intended milestones as part of the application procedure. Game Facilitators then have the responsibility to assess and approve these milestones.\n        * Once a grant is sanctioned and the project has successfully undergone KYC and consented to our compliance policy, they are required to submit detailed reports of their milestones through the App. The Ship Operator meticulously reviews these submissions to ascertain whether the reported milestones align with the approved plan.\n        * Subsequent to the Ship Operator’s validation, the Game Facilitator will also validate and is authorized to release the allocated funds to the project. This systematic approach ensures that only those projects that fulfill their proposed objectives receive the funding.\n        * The following screenshots are what a milestone report looks like in the app:\n\n![img](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/a/a1af5a24139793746c01a7d8d48820563e743cb0.png)\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/b/b40dd9cf8899822bcd02b49a9331bef9998bffa8.png)\n\n* Impact Measurement: Grant Ships does not evaluate impact directly, instead providing numerous onchain events detailing all activity within the grants program, which can be fed into external impact evaluation systems. \n* Accountability Mechanisms: While encouraging excellence and freedom to run a Ship how operators choose, our system also has strong accountability mechanisms in place. * Underperformance: In cases where a Ship repeatedly underperforms or fails to meet the community’s standards of integrity and impact, the DAO has the authority to defund them completely or revoke their ability to allocate funds. There is also a “flag” system in place which allows the game facilitator to take immediate action if a Ship’s actions are outside of compliance. * Graduated Consequences: A yellow flag can be issued by Game Facilitators which acts as additional context to voters during TCR votes. A red flag is issued for obvious, repeated or intentional violations by a Grant Ship. A red flag suspends a Ship’s ability to distribute funding, until and only if, the DAO reinstates the Ship’s permissions through a TCR vote.\n>* Cultural Reinforcement: By tying funding to performance and making the outcomes publicly available, we foster a culture of accountability and excellence within the DAO ecosystem. Operators are motivated not only by potential funding but also by the prestige and recognition that come from being a top-performing Ship.\n>* Competitive and Collaborative: The competitive environment provided by the Grant Ships game will attract high-quality projects and allocators who are committed to the success of ApeChain. We also anticipate patterns of cooperation, skill-sharing and seeking of win/wins among ships and builders in the interest of creating something awesome as a community.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/6f16d0c137e7cd4ff182850884fa6a32100ebbd5.png)\nSample portion of feed from the Grant Ships App from a live grant round\n\n* Documentation and Reporting: Feeds generated from smart contract data are accessible through the Grant Ships app. These feeds detail funding activities providing key metrics and insights for voters to use during decision making.\n    * Compliance Policy and Attestation: Fund allocations must be approved by a Game Faciltator before they can be distributed by a Grant Ship. This provides the DAO with the option to implement policies and prerequisites for grant recipients (e.g. KYC compliance, AML procedures, etc.). This takes the responsibility and potential conflict of interest from the Grant Ship operators and lets them focus on making wise allocation decisions.\n        * The duty of performing due diligence, including KYC/KYB checks, is assigned to the elected Game Facilitators. They are tasked with ensuring compliance with all ApeCoin DAO regulations. Our contracts stipulate that Ship Operators are not involved in handling grant funds; instead, a Game Facilitator is required to authorize fund transfers to grant recipients. This occurs only after verifying that all requirements have been fulfilled.\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 550,000 $APE.\n![Screenshot 2024-07-31 at 1.50.29 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreigw5kiihvvpd3weejmcgogy52tlvxkmnwftea4dtrahygfwixztsi)\n    \n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-442-grant-ships-accelerating-apecoins-ecosystem-evolution/23455\n\n#### IMPORTANT NOTE: The BOTB DAO Snapshot is a mirrored version of the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot.

      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION \n\nTitle Sponsorship of a leading web3 daily show and a weekly segment featuring MBAC brands. Ongoing promotion of $APE, ApeChain and MBA / MBAC brands on X and the major podcast platforms.\n\n#### Six month partnership to include:\n1. Title Sponsor\n  a) Coffee with Captain Powered by $APE on ApeChain\n  b) Coffee with Captain Powered by ApeChain\n  c) Coffee with Captain Powered by $APE\nThe title will appear in the Live X Spaces for the duration of the show, as well as in the title of the podcast recordings and preferred link(s) will be included in the show notes. This title sponsorship includes any live shows during the sponsorship period as well. For example, live Coffee with Captain at ApeFest will be powered by $APE\n\n2.  A weekly segment “Made by ApeCoin Mondays”\nSponsored interview around 9AM EST on Coffee with Captain.\nEach week we’ll interview a MBA builder at/around the peak of our Monday show.\nPreferred brand links will be featured in show notes in the podcast recordings.\nWe’ll also work with Thank Ape to encourage and reward audience engagement with the brands that are being featured.\n\n3.  A weekly “ApeCoin Ecosystem update with @Lost”\nA recurring sponsored segment on Wednesday at 9:45am EST on Coffee with Captain. Clip will be captured and Audiograms can be repurposed as shorts ApeCoin Youtube.\n\n4.  ApeChain will become the home of Coffee with Captain\nThrough a multi-phased approach we will migrate all of our future published content to be hosted on ApeChain. Beginning with our [weekly show summary](https://dgen.network/coffee-with-captain-recap-week-24-6-10-6-14/)\nPotentially a fork of [Mirror](https://mirror.xyz) or [Paragraph](https://paragraph.xyz)\nTo be clear, this proposal does not take into consideration the development of, or funding of an on-chain publishing platform, rather a commitment to making ApeChain our home for published content and we’d love to work with others in the community who build the platform.\n\n5. With a partnership in place Cap & Steve will actively seek news and events from the ApeChain community to discuss organically on CwC throughout the week, in addition to the Made By ApeCoin Monday segment.\n\n6. Two professional audiograms per week will be provided to the ApeCoin DAO, ApeComms, and the MBAC brand that was featured. An example of an audiogram clip produced by Macki can be seen [quote tweeted here](https://x.com/jholguin/status/1804529966157004988) - capturing the attention and engagement of other leaders in the space.\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThis proposal will benefit ApeChain and Made by ApeCoin builders, as well as the Coffee with Captain community, listeners and the small CwC team, including two OG Apes, at a minimum. Hopefully this idea inspires other content creators to work closely with the ApeCoin DAO and make ApeChain their home also.\n\nIn addition to live Spaces, podcast recordings and summaries - this title sponsorship will carry over to any events in real life, and will include sponsorship at a minimum of 3 live events over the remainder of 2024, live shows are planned at VeeCon, ApeFest and Art Basel.\n\nIn total over a 6 month sponsorship, there will 52 professional audiograms provided featuring $ape and community build brand and businesses. 26 business or brands built by ApeCoin will receive a sponsored interview at no cost to them, as well as 26 ApeCoin DAO Ecosystem updates presented to a diverse crypto and web3 audience. And ApeChain will hopefully become the first ecosystem that the Coffee with Captain community and listener base thinks about when looking for a home to build.\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $85,000 USD paid in ApeCoin.\n\nWebsite - $500 Production - $8,500 Show Operations - $8,500 Talent - $67,500 Total: $85,000\n\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-479-coffee-with-captain-powered-by-ape-on-apechain/24548\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE: The BOTB DAO Snapshot is a mirrored version of the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot.\nMembers will vote with BOTB NFTs on our BOTB DAO Snapshot.

      "title": " AIP-449: Translation System and Community Reward Program ",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION \n\nThe DAO is international in nature and should not be limited by language. Our goal is to comprehensively increase the participation rate of DAO members. In addition to translating articles into various languages, we will also proactively send each AIP to different communities, collect opinions from each community, and publicly disclose them to all members on our website.\n\nWe will arrange for employees to communicate with leaders of various communities and integrate into those communities. They will use the translation system to translate primarily English articles and opinions into different languages, thereby increasing DAO member participation. Our employees play a crucial role in disseminating information and gathering community opinions. This not only enhances the transparency of the DAO but, more importantly, fosters cohesion among members from different regions, thus increasing their sense of value and commitment.\n\nWhen two or more different language communities need to hold an online meeting, our system will provide real-time AI oral translation, allowing communities to understand each other’s opinions immediately and respond promptly, thus overcoming language barriers.\n\nWe encourage DAO members to make proposals. In addition to translating the AIPs for voting into various languages, we will assist community members in translating their opinions. The system can also provide oral translation for DAO members’ AIPs. For example, Tony, a Japanese member, speaks his AIP in Japanese to the system, the real-time AI translation feature will convert the Japanese into an English document. This facilitates DAO members in writing their AIPs and sharing AIPs or opinions with other communities.\n\nIn order to comprehensively increase the participation of DAO members, we will not only provide comprehensive language and community assistance, but also develop a reward mechanism to encourage everyone to participate and reward Apecoin.\n\nThe reward funds are designed to incentivize and recognize the active participation and contributions of APE coin holders in the DAO. These funds will be distributed through a transparent and fair system, ensuring that all participants have an equal opportunity to benefit. Below are the main aspects of the reward distribution process:\n\nReward Criteria and Mechanism\n1. Contribution-Based Rewards: The majority of the funds will be allocated based on the contribution levels of APE coin holders. Contributions can include proposing and developing AIPs, participating in discussions, voting, and other forms of engagement that add value to the DAO. We will use a points-based system to quantify contributions, with more significant and impactful activities earning more points.\n2. Participation Rewards: To encourage broad participation, a portion of the rewards will be randomly distributed to APE coin holders who participate in voting and other community activities. This ensures that even smaller holders feel valued and are motivated to engage.\n\nDistribution Process\n1. Points Accumulation: We will calculate points on a monthly basis. The system will accumulate points based on the activities and contributions of APE holders. At the end of each month, these points will be converted into corresponding reward tokens.\n2. Transparency and Verification: All contributions and points will be recorded in the system to ensure verifiability. This prevents any fraudulent activity and ensures fair distribution.\n3. Reward Payment: Once verified, the rewards will be directly distributed to the wallets of eligible APE coin holders. Distribution will occur regularly to ensure that contributors are consistently recognized and rewarded.\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n1. Bringing the APECOIN DAO to the global stage The APECOIN DAO should not be limited to a single language. In the past, the participation rate of Asian members has been relatively low, with fewer proposals initiated. We want to ensure that friends from every country have a share.\n2. Providing sustainable returns for APE members By opening up a reward system, we will create a reward mechanism to encourage participation and reward APE. The first quarter will be 100,000 APE. In the following quarters, we will provide over 95% of the proposal funds as rewards for APE holders.\n3. Maximizing the transparency and participation of AIPs In the past, information has not been circulated well. We will translate the proposals and spread them to each community, allowing everyone to monitor the AIP authors.\n4. Strengthening communication between APE communities We will collect and summarize the opinions of each community weekly, translate them into different versions and feed back to each community. We will provide real-time AI oral translation, allowing communities to understand each other’s opinions immediately and timely communication.\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \n\nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 460,000 APE.\n\nTranslation software system: 190,000 APE Reward system: 40,000 APE\n\n##### Translation Software & Reward System breakdown\n- Project Setup Phases\n    - Requirements Analysis and Planning Cost: 11,000 $APE\n    - Design Phase Cost: 22,000 $APE Platform Architect (1) Platform Requirements: Design tools (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD)\n    - Technology Selection and Prototype Development Cost: 16,700 $APE Personnel: Frontend Developer (1) Backend Developer (1) Tester (1) Platform Requirements: Development tools, prototype tools (e.g., InVision)\n\n- Project Initiation Phase\n    - Development and Implementation Cost: 100,000 $APE Personnel: Frontend Developers (2) Backend Developers (3) Testers (2) DevOps Engineer (1) Platform Requirements: SPA website development framework (e.g., Vue.js, React), backend services (e.g., Node.js, Express)\n    - Testing and Quality Assurance Cost: 30,000 $APE Personnel: Testers (2) Automation Test Engineer (1) Platform Requirements: Testing tools (e.g., Selenium, JUnit), continuous integration tools (e.g., Jenkins)\n    - Deployment and Go-Live Cost: 25,000 $APE Personnel: DevOps Engineer (1) System Administrator (1) Platform Requirements: Cloud platform services (e.g., Azure), monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)\n\tTotal Cost: 230,000 $APE\n\nMaintenance costs: 80,000 APE\nEmployee costs: 50,000 APE\n\n##### Employee Costs breakdown\n\nEmployee A.

      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION \n\nWe will launch an APE-themed hotel in a prime location in central Bangkok, Thailand. Our goal is to enhance the BAYC IP Exposure, visibility and utility of ApeCoin, and generate actual revenue for ApeCoin DAO.\n\nThis proposal combines IP application, the hotel industry, the arts, and the cryptocurrency field. The hotel will offer a variety of activities, including ApeCoin-themed exhibitions, an APE bar, various APE community-themed rooms, an APE swimming pool, and an MBA-themed exhibition area, fully promoting ApeCoin, ApeChain, and various APE communities. We will provide various benefits to the APE community.\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\n1.Revenue Generation: 50% of the revenues from themed rooms will be received by ApeCoin DAO for one year once these rooms are completed.

(Future plans for launch passes on apechain)\n\n##### Motorverse Games:\n- karting/drifting experience with Motorverse\n- Ape avatars & branding in Motorverse Games\nWeb3 community:\n    - We are able to utilize F1, which is a growing motorsports to connect with every web3 community, and use F1 as a core interest to bring them into a apecoin ecosystem, via participations, purchasing of apecoin etc\nWeb2 community: \n- Currently there are about 1.1 million accounts that plays fantasy f1, using the official website current platform users is able to see our competition & prize pool, whereby it will attract them to participate to win the prize pool, allowing more users coming into the ecosystem\n\n##### F1 Fantasy:\nF1 fantasy Outlook: https://fantasy.formula1.com/ Choose your driver & team\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/b/b6742bed920a40746936e27cba49ccf235abee9c.png)\n![img5](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/f23e1e31ccde8a4506624a17b9abcd28468195c5.png)\n\n##### Future Plans:\nUtilization of Ape Chain to launch NFTs which can be add as a participation pass.\n\nSeveral elements make up “W3 GP”. At the core of it is a “token gated” Fantasy F1 league, hosted through F1’s own fantasy platform, allowing communities to compete with friends and earn bragging rights as to who has the most “wheel knowledge”. Players will score points across the remainder of the 2024 F1 season, and whoever has the most points at the end will win an amount of $APE from the prize pool.\n\nSecondly, the community will find its place within the [Motorverse - the home of vehicle culture in Web3, built by Animoca Brands] (http://motorverse.com/ 1). A dedicated Discord channel within the larger Motorverse Discord will be set up to host all the banter and heated discussions that come with an F1 race weekend. There will also be opportunities for Apecoin to feature in upcoming game releases & IRL activations by Motorverse.\n\nLast but not least, we want to bring the community together! We want to host an IRL F1 watch party at Token2049 in Singapore, which happens to coincide with the 2024 Singapore F1 Grand Prix. The idea is to book out a venue for the W3GP community to experience and enjoy the race together.\n\nIn the future, we also want to host IRL karting or drifting experiences, which will be subject to the success of W3GP in 2024.

      "title": "AIP-438: ApeCoin Ventures ",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION \n\n##### Team Formation\nAnimoca Ventures, an early stage venture capital arm of Animoca Brands, proposes the establishment of ApeCoin Ventures – combining Animoca Ventures historical expertise with the community’s strong reach to amplify awareness and scale adoption and utilities of ApeCoin.\n\nIn a 1:1 matching structure, we propose the deployment of USD$5 million worth of $APE from the ApeCoin DAO, to be matched by Animoca Ventures’ funding of USD$5 million in fiat to create a combined US$10 million fund. Funding from Animoca Ventures ensures that interests of both parties are fully aligned for joint success.\n\nThe fund management is currently provided by ASCENT Fund Services. ASCENT’s role is to be a custodian and disburse funds, they don’t make fund decisions. They are licensed for these types of operations and we would set up the legal entity for this, which would happen very quickly should the AIP be approved. The suggestion is to liquidate the $APE received into cash as soon as practical so that we can match the amount in dollars.\n\nNo multi-sig wallet would be utilized because ASCENT would basically be managing fiat, so we would manage an orderly sale process. Animoca Ventures would be receiving the ApeCoin and sell the $APE to then deposit it as fiat to ASCENT, which would be matched with $5m of Animoca Ventures funds.\n\n##### Investment Ventures\nBy investing together into early web3 ventures, we will drive and encourage integrated utilities and adoption for ApeCoin – leveraging our venture expertise to the community’s energy, reach, as well as opportunities, to generate long-term value for ApeCoin DAO and its relevant ecosystem.\n\nOur investment strategy targets seed and Series A stage start-ups, prioritizing those that can integrate ApeCoin into their ecosystem with the goal of increasing the value, utilities, use cases, synergies, network effect and influences of ApeCoin.\n\n##### Scope of Operations\nAnimoca Ventures team will be responsible for the daily operations of ApeCoin Ventures, including but not limited to the following areas:\n* Investment & Acceleration: Besides investments, ApeCoin Ventures will play a critical role in supporting Web3 ventures like the role of an accelerator such as providing funding, research, and operational support to help founders scale their projects from the early stages.\n* Research and Due Diligence: ApeCoin Ventures has a deep understanding of blockchain technology, cryptography, security and protocols. It provides research and due diligence support to help founders navigate the complexities of various Web3 business models, programs and technologies.\n* Tokenomics & Governance: Tokenomics advisory is one of the core pillars of Animoca Brands. It involves a great amount of industry expertise and trade secrets to excel to design token models that incentivize desired behavior, align with the goals of the project and ensure project sustainability. Governance models will also be examined for business performance uplift, risk mitigation and long-term success.\n* Partnerships & Collaborations: ApeCoin Ventures will be able to leverage Animoca Brands network to help ventures connect to and collaborate with other projects, investors, and ecosystem partners to achieve their goals. These partnerships can provide access to new technologies, markets, communities, and expertise, helping them to scale and innovate more quickly.\n\n##### Exit Strategies\nUpon successful exits, 50% of the token proceeds will be sent back to ApeCoin DAO, with the plan (or an option) to convert profits back into ApeCoin. This approach aims to boost ApeCoin’s utility and adoption, leveraging our expertise in venture capital alongside the vibrant energy of the community.\n\nAnimoca Brands has had a history of successful web3 investments in the space some of them can be seen at https://www.animocabrands.com/investment-portfolio and https://animoca.ventures. Notable investments include [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/), [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com) (Sky Mavis), [Pixels](https://www.pixels.xyz), [Heroes of Mavia](https://www.mavia.com), [xAI](https://x.ai), [TON](https://ton.org), [Immutable](https://www.immutable.com), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology), [Berachain](https://www.berachain.com), [YGG](https://www.yieldguild.io)and many others including of course [Yuga Labs](https://yuga.com).\n\nThe investment exit strategies are diverse and evolving. Besides traditional exit methods like M&A and IPOs (e.g. Coinbase went public in 2021), there are Web3 specific means like token launches and community-driven liquidity events.\n\nIn the event of a “web3 exit” (i.e. token launch) we would liquidate the proceeds/profits and use it to repurchase ApeCoin on market and return it as $APE to the DAO. It is 50% of all token proceeds because 50% is funded by the DAO.\n\nThe fund will receive returns in Tokens which it then proposed to swap into ApeCoin and return to the Foundation as per the proposal. It doesn’t receive gross revenues as it’s not your classical operating business.\n\nIn other words if the project were to receive 100 tokens worth $1 where it to sell them it would propose to use the $100 dollars to buy $APE and return the $APE.\n\nIf the Foundation desires to have us monetize the 100 tokens and then return it in fiat as $100 it could be possible but was not what was proposed.\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nHere is a summary of the proposed investment details:\n* Animoca Ventures matches the funding on a 1:1 basis with US$5 million in fiat, together with ApeCoin DAO funding of another US$5 million in the form of $APE.\n* ApeCoin DAO will receive 50% of all token proceeds upon successful venture exits in the form of $APE for future ecosystem grants\n* Two-year timeline of fund deployment. Any remaining or unused $APE will be returned to the ApeCoin DAO treaury should the fund not be deployed within the stipulated timeline.\n* The targeting check sizes are between US$100,000 to $250,000 per startup which would facilitate backing potentially up to 80 ventures at seed/Series A stages – curated to the highest standards\n* A low management fee of one percent (1%) will be charged for project vetting, due diligence, ecosystem support, partnership outreach, and other services rendered by Animoca Ventures to carry out the required operations. It is 1% of the total and would be charged out of the total amount i.e. $10m (half of which is contributed by us). This is an annual management fee and as the fund intends to operate for 2 years it would amount to 100k per year and effectively 50k a year for the funds from the DAO. There are no performance fees charged for the $5 million contribution for the DAO, normally funds operate on a 2/20 structure i.e. 2% management fee and 20% share of profits but for the purposes of this proposal we will not be charging this.\n* Exposure of APECOIN to a variety of promising startup and companies\n\nWith our investment matching, operating expertise and focus on early stage deals, we aim to increase $APE utility awareness and accelerate expansion of the ApeCoin ecosystem through promising, synergistic projects.\n\nThe following benefits are expected as a result of this proposed partnership from the perspective of ApeCoin DAO:\n\n### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $5,000,000 USD.\n\n* Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund will be US$5 million dollars paid in $APE at the time of transfer (assuming the date was 5/20/2024 that would be 4,130,466 ApeCoin)\n* US$5 million worth of $APE will be matched with US$5 million in fiat by Animoca Ventures, with a report of Animoca’s financial postion (indicating its ability to contribute matching funding) found here.\n* We do not anticipate raising any third-party capital.\n* The suggestion is to liquidate the $APE received into cash as soon as practical so that Animoca Ventures can match the amount in dollars.\n* We could be open to receiving funding in tranches, but it would then mean we would only match our funding amounts in a similar fashion (i.e. if we receive 1M$ worth of APE we would match it with 1M$ of FIAT/USD/USDC at that time).\n* No funds gained as a result of ApeCoin Ventures investment strategies would be used for voting, as they would be sold for the purposes of investment.\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-438-apecoin-ventures/23550\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": " AIP-470: MBA Powered ApeFest Lisbon x ApeCoin Merch ",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION \n\nBuilding on Normie’s AIP-299 idea for an ApeFest/ApeCoin merch activation, I’ve been wanting to get this idea up for a while. I reached out to Normie to find out if they were planning on creating a 2024 ApeFest merch AIP and the answer was no. So, here we are.\n\nGenerating increased exposure to ApeCoin DAO via unique, high quality, collaborative merch made by the community…\n\nThe idea here is to build on that initial AIP concept. We will be creating merch, along with the help of other MBA businesses, that can be distributed to ApeCoin holders for ApeFest.\n\nThis will not be a typical generic hoodie merch kit. It will be custom ApeFest Lisbon X ApeCoin merch!\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nWe will have high quality merch that holders can be proud of wearing and posting about on social media before, during, and after ApeFest.\n\nWorking with other MBA license holders, we will include some of their products (to be determined based on custom options), to help with awareness and word of mouth.\n\nWe’ll require that you have a specific role in the ApeCoin Discord or Discourse forum plus have an ApeFest ticket in order to claim your free merch package (1 per person). We will be asking claimers to submit a screenshot of their Tokenproof ticket/dashboard, tied to their wallet containing the ApeCoin. This will show the ticket and the wallet address.\n\nWe will also have some surplus items that we can potentially giveaway at ApeCoin/ApeFest side events and other ApeCoin centric events throughout the year.\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $96,500.\n\nThe plan is budgeting $225 per merch kit for 250 total with about $50 per kit for packaging and logistics ($69,000); we would only receive $69k upon AIP approval. The additional $27,500 to make 100 extra kits would be received only if we sell out of the 250 kits, else the unused funds would remain with the DAO treasury.\n\nMerch Kit Budget Details: Merch Kit - $225 (this includes all MBA products sourced during the Discovery Phase)\n\nLogistics per kit claim - $50 (this includes the overall kit packaging and shipping to claimers)\n\nTotal Overall Per - $275\n\n$69,000/$275 = 250 Merch Kits\n\nSpecifics will be ironed out on product costs once I have the MBAs selected and their product offerings.\n\nAnything surplus would go to other events as previously stated.\n\nThis will cover all products, packaging, and logistics.\n\nUpon approval, the DAO would release the initial $69,000 to cover the 250 kits.\n\nClaim Out Phase 1: If the initial claim for the merch kits is successful and sells out (250 kits), I intend to request a reorder with a pre-order period to meet excess demand for those not able to claim during the first claim phase.\n\nAfter that, I will open it up to have the other 100 claimable for the other $27,500 to be released to cover the extra 100 merch kits. Else, the remaining $27,500 would remain with the DAO treasury.\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/9d8a5617a9497b8ba6bbd1484d9694bba8a639b5.png)\n\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-470-mba-powered-apefest-lisbon-x-apecoin-merch/24518\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-444: Growing Wellness: Home Harvest’s billion dollar opportunity to improve the way we live & eat, powered by grow2earn ",
      "content": "### PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION \n![img0](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/90e4dc97e71e0c2da98714eb8ca89b512e75f2aa.jpeg)\nIntroducing Home Harvest…\n\nHome Harvest is a consumer tech company focused on Growing Wellness™ around the world. We’ve developed an entire wellness ecosystem, based around revolutionary growing units for the home that unite design, horticulture and technology. We are enabling a revolution in wellness through the way food is produced and consumed.\n\nOur first product, accompanied by our IoT grow platform, app and wellness co-pilot, is an indoor ‘smart-farm’ unit that is miles ahead of anything else currently on the market, has a patented lighting system to make it more efficient than the competitors and a ‘mass market’ price point that is currently not covered by existing products in the market.\n\nOur mission is: ‘Zero food miles, Zero packaging. Zero waste. Healthy living. Healthy planet.’\n\nFollowing a 3 year long pilot programme in homes, schools and restaurants, Home Harvest is already a hit with consumers, having developed a range of growing units that revolutionise healthy living by enabling consumers to grow everyday foods in their own home. Our indoor ‘smart farms’ unlock professional growing results for the mass market, allowing consumers to grow and harvest hundreds of varieties of superfoods, leafy greens and herbs within just 8 days of planting.\n\nHealthy living and healthy planet…\n\nOur value proposition massively reduces consumer cost, food waste, food miles and transportation carbon emissions while delivering the very healthiest of produce directly into the homes of consumers around the world.\n\nEvery farmer is also supported by our nutritional co-pilot; a personal ally in a consumer’s journey to a vibrant world of healthy eating, turning the road to wellness into a rewarding and enjoyable voyage. With our app-based co-pilot, growing food and following your own healthy diet at home becomes less of a chore and more of an uplifting, self-driven mission.\n\n“Home Harvest brings the heart and soul of healthy living directly into your home. It is a game changer.” Professor Seth Davis - Chair of Plant Biology : University of York\n\nToken driven reward programme and web3 backbone…\n\n![img](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/8/81650bfd9767a918aca2c2d216fd00e6c2e0a737.jpeg)\n\nChanging consumer behaviour requires encouragement and our tokenised rewards programme will encourage consumers to ‘Grow to Earn’, ‘Live Healthily to Earn’ and ‘Cook to Earn’ whilst also rewarding the reduction in carbon footprint that’s achieved by using a Home Harvest smart farm.\n\nVery simply, we forecast that additional web3 infrastructure and token incentives could help deliver an additional 40% uplift in sales over the first 5 years - $500m in revenue / 500k additional customers. This revenue uplift from web3 integration translates into an additional $1.25 Billion in EV at a x15 multiple of EBITDA.\n\nWe want to be a leading example of how a web3 funded / powered product can make real societal change, be hugely profitable and scale much faster than traditional product and retail tech. As an aside to the financial potential, we feel the potential for PR and mainstream media spotlight on how ‘the jpeg monkeys’ assembled and created a global wellness unicorn is also of real benefit to the relevant communities and web3 in general.\n\nThe $GROW token will launch with an initial raise supported by an extensive community points campaign to bring awareness and build community in the lead up to the product launch. Weighted token emissions will benefit early adopters and communities of the new home-growing health revolution (BAYC, MAYC, MOCA communities and $APE holders), an airdrop schedule of $GROW will be scheduled to coincide with the launch of the physical product and we have a token roadmap that plans to make full use of ApeChain capabilities. We aim to be one of the first ‘big’ products on the chain.\n\nThe rewards scheme is curated to reward early participation as well as community membership from BAYC, MAYC, MOCA and $APE holders. Early participants in the points program also have the opportunity to earn the cost of a pre-sale smart farm prior to launch. Once the unit is in place and in-use, the user or farmer also starts to earn monthly reward points for grow time / usage, grow variety, grow-based tasks, community involvement in the app and more, which will be converted into $GROW tokens as part of the monthly emission schedule. A perpetual rewards mechanism, funded by profits from the sales of the Home Harvest units, surrounding product and peripherals range and the subscription model.\n\nAdditional rewards will include ‘money can’t buy’ products and events such as limited edition MBA and Apecoin DAO styled smart farms, limited seat access to chef recipes and live video one on ones, limited edition merchandise, farmers equipment, Ape-only early access to each new experiential store opening and more.\n\nThere are 3 token phases:\n1. Pre-launch / Raise:\n\nA rewards framework which distributes points to active community members and partners during the 12 months lead up to production. Initial points airdrop and multiplier for BAYC, MAYC, MOCA communities and $APE holders.\n\nObjectives: An opportunity to raise additional funds and gain pre-sale orders of the unit, during the lead up to production.\n* Building a strong community pre-launch\n* Gaining insight into eating and dieting behaviors\n* Giving early adopters the opportunity to earn back the cost of a pre-sale unit, prior to delivery\n* Allowing point staking and other beneficial token / defi practices, subject to jurisdiction\n\n2. Launch:\nCoinciding with the physical product launch, $GROW built on Apechain, airdropped to early adopters, points accruers and BAYC, MAYC, MOCA communities and $APE holders. Sell $GROW after a lock period, or exchange for free physical units.\n\nObjectives: A rewards system that moves from primarily community-based to based on unit usage, app usage and token holding / potential staking\n* Powering the Grow2Earn concept and enabling us to reward users for living healthier lifestyles\n* Enabling us to reward users with carbon offset credits, converted into $GROW\n* Enabling web3 enhanced token-gating, gamification and custom supplies / merchandise\n* Allowing governance over certain aspects of the company growth\n\n3. Post-Launch:\n* A method to continually reward and involve the community in the success of Home Harvest with monthly emissions.\n* A case study for the benefits of web3 infrastructure in a web2 product\n* An ability to create tailored growing experiences and rewards, based on individual users / wallet connection\n\nFurther consideration: Our protocol roadmap is a work in progress but we’re also currently exploring the possibilities of creating the $GROW token as an OFT, enabling it to be native to ApeChain, Arb and other orbit chains like the upcoming AnimeChain from Azuki. We’ve sought advice from consulted with some of the biggest builders in web3 and feel we have access to THE best-in-class web3 team to help facilitate the token and ecosystem development, working alongside our established and experienced founders and product engineering team.\n\nAdditional Home Harvesters IP…\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/3/3f6c605117e84b6dbf17b7a76ba7b46ca820c87c.png)\n\nWe’ve also developed an immersive world of inspiring digital characters that reward and gamify growing, healthy eating and sustainability using Home Harvest products. These will be upgraded as part of the points system and earned rewards; much like the Netflix app, a junior user will also have the ability to participate in a specific range of growing games, upgrades and quests, aimed at teaching them about healthy living and wellness. Pudgy are pioneers in crossing over to web2 and also a leading example of a web3 brand beginning to stake a claim on some of the $28 billion global toy market. We will follow suit with the Home Harvesters.\n\nThese characters will be airdropped to early adopters, pre-sale unit purchasers and BAYC, MAYC, MOCA communities and $APE holders and will provide another licensing and revenue opportunity to the ecosystem.\n\nA huge global market that’s growing…\n\nThe global addressable market for the main unit is conservatively well over 200 million families driven by the consumer desire for cost conscious, healthy and sustainable living. Our commercial proposition is underpinned by a high margin, monthly subscription powered by an app that delivers dietary advice, recipe ideas, monthly supplies, growing support, ultimately building the world’s largest community of connected growers.\n\nA unicorn in the making…\n\nPROPOSAL\n[Please continue reading the rest of this AIP on the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot and Discourse]\n\n------------ Important Note for BOTB NFT voters --------------\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Unfortunately, due to the character limit of the BOTB Snapshot, the AIP contents on ApeCoin DAO Snapshot could not be fully duplicated here.

      "content": "### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal provides accommodation at the AAA 4 Diamond Hotel ‘Wyndham Grand Clearwater Beach’.\n\nProviding an extravaganza stay (for up to 300 $APE holders on a first-come first-served basis) by the scenic gulf shore. With crystal clear blue water and white sand beaches, this could be an annual gathering space for ApeCoin DAO members to party. This proposal gives up to 300 community members a place to stay in the AAA 4 Diamond hotel “Wyndham Grand Clearwater Beach” for hosting Apecoin and Bored Apes parties, just in case someone is seasick of the Yacht Club parties.\n\nOwnership of ApeCoin will be verified through a digital wallet check at registration, minimum ApeCoin requirements are as follows:\n* 1 $APE = entry to conference and party.\n* 1000 $APE staked = 1 hotel room based on a first come first basis.\n* 2 Presidential suites will be giveaways for two lucky ApeCoin holders during the event.\n\nLocation: 100 Coronado drive Clearwater Florida USA\n\nhttps://www.wyndhamgrandclearwater.com/\n\n![Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 5.07.04 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreigqddl724kua3jqcvfqftv6fw5q6wm3pnlvlxe6noo6urqtfmcumu)\n    \n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/1700d7d003c7b3e0a0ba5e3de9c3932b6d1308f2.jpeg)\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/d/d6c85bcfeb5e1579b4a8a05e8c4b44736af7ec02.jpeg)\n\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nApe Hospitality Group aims to host a DAO only conference with $ape holders and partner communities under one roof focused on the DAO brand apart from Yuga Labs. There’s a huge misconception that still exist, many people hesitate to get involve with the DAO because they still think its just for BAYC holders. Such conferences without a high barrier of entry will create a more welcoming and IRL impact for all $ape holders.\n\nThrough this, people can interact with each other directly as well as various working groups, create bonds and get a wider idea of what we as Apecoin DAO are doing. Everyone (pending capacity) who holds $APE gets to experience the club parties at the hotel. We’ve seen a major fomo among every community outside Bored Apes during Apefest, even with the recent announcement. With this proposal, Ape Hospitality Group aims to make a place for all $ape holders to meet, party and hang out with fellow DAO members. This will help the DAO grow the unique number of holders, and give a sense of belongingness.\n\nThe main attraction will be Apecoin DAO panels with different Working Groups (who may opt in to participate), pop-up stalls for MBA licensees and booths.This will be an exclusive DAO conference for community members and builders to get together and interact with each other. Share alphas, create memories and build.\n\nKey Benefits Summary\n* Conference and get together for $Ape holders\n* Panel discussion\n* Networking with a wider $ape ecosystem\n* Pop up stalls and booth for MBA products\n* Party!\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \nThe total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $300,000 USD to be paid in $APE.\n\nBreakdown:\n* Booking: $184,000 (Rooms: $109,000 & Conference Hall: $75,000)\n* Media and Entertainment: $50,000\n    * Photography/Videography\n    * Music/DJ\n    * Lights\n    * Merchandise\n    * Catering\n* Operations: $66,000\n    * Administration\n    * Marketing\n    * Contingency\n    * Insurance\n* Additional costs are included in each implementation step as detailed above.\n\nThe AIP covers a 1-night stay for 300 $APE holders, first come first served. The author will check proof of holding $APE for interested people within the DAO.\n\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-425-ape-hospitality-group-apecoin-summit/23276\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-450: NFT Event Check-in Solution based on ApeChain ",
      "content": "### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal aims to introduce an NFT event check-in solution based on ApeChain, combining hardware products (NFC chips and scanners) and software products (an app based on ApeChain) to provide NFT holders with an immersive experience at all NFT offline events.\n\n*Specific Implementation Plan:*\n\nIn terms of hardware products, we will use NFC technology combined with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) to embed NFC chips into peripheral products, including clothing, hats, toys, and skateboards. We will also design and manufacture NFC scanners to detect products with NFC chips and read selected NFT image data in an app based on ApeChain, then display on a large screen to realize the conceptual scenario of NFT as our web3 identity and participate in real offline events. Simultaneously, scanners will also be used to support the “Unmanned check-in” model in Merch stores.\n\nIn terms of software products, we will develop an app based on ApeChain, offering features such as wallet connecting, NFT selection, and animated scene corresponding to the ticket you purchased. The app will provide a user-friendly interface for NFT holders to easily use the check-in system. All check-in animations can be individually created and saved by users, forming a unique user-generated content (UGC) culture, which also makes it easier to spread within communities and out of the web3. For event organizers, animating event tickets to become a unique background for attendees can help expand the brand’s influence and generate much higher traffic than traditional marketing methods.\n\nThis solution will fully leverage the image of all NFTs, providing NFT holders with a more immersive experience and enriching existing methods of peripheral product distribution. It will create unique and native web3 gameplay during the offline events and provide all NFTs with more practical value beyond avatars.\n\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe proposed NFT event check-in solution will bring several benefits to the APECHAIN ecosystem:\n\n* Enhanced Adoption and Engagement: By providing NFT holders with an immersive experience at web3 offline events, the solution will increase adoption and engagement within the $APE ecosystem. NFT holders will feel more connected to the ecosystem and be incentivized to participate in events and activities.\n* Increased Visibility and Recognition: The innovative nature of the check-in solution, coupled with its use of ApeChain, will enhance the visibility and recognition of $APE in the broader market. This will attract more users, projects, and potential collaborators to the ecosystem, driving its growth and fostering a vibrant community.\n* Diversification of Use Cases: The check-in solution will demonstrate the versatility of $APE beyond where we are right now, showcasing its potential in the realm of NFT event management and engagement. This diversification of use cases will attract new projects and investors to $APE, expanding its reach and utility.\n\nOverall, the NFT event check-in solution will contribute to the growth and development of the APE CHAIN ecosystem, defining APE CHAIN as the primary chain for all NFTs and continuously providing value for all $APE holders.\n\n\n\n### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 480,000 $APE The specific allocation is as follows:\n\n1. Hardware Design and Production (50% of the budget, 240,000 $APE):\n* NFC Chip Design and Production: 100,000 $APE\n    * Design and Customization: 80,000 $APE\n    * Production and Assembly: 20,000 $APE\n* NFC Scanner Development and Production: 120,000 $APE\n    * Design and Development: 80,000 $APE\n    * Production and Assembly: 40,000 $APE\n* Display Equipment: 20,000 $APE\n\n2. Software Development and Testing (40% of the budget, 192,000 $APE):\n* APP Development: 115,200 $APE\n    * Front-end Development: 38,400 $APE\n    * Back-end Development: 38,400 $APE\n    * Blockchain Integration and Smart Contract Development: 38,400 $APE\n* Application Testing and Optimization: 48,000 $APE\n    * Functional Testing: 19,200 $APE\n    * Security Testing: 19,200 $APE\n    * User Experience Optimization: 9,600 $APE\n* Entrance Animation Creation and Display Function: 28,800 $APE\n    * Animation Design and Development: 19,200 $APE\n    * Animation Display Technology Integration: 9,600 $APE\n\n3. User Testing, Promotion, and Launch (10% of the budget, 48,000 $APE):\n* User Testing and Feedback Collection: 19,200$APE\n    * User Testing Planning and Execution: 9,600 $APE\n    * User Feedback Collection and Analysis: 9,600 $APE\n* Product Promotion and Marketing: 19,200 $APE\n    * Social Media Marketing: 9,600 $APE\n    * Online and Offline Event Promotion: 9,600 $APE\n* Launch Preparation and Support: 9,600 $APE\n    * Platform Launch Preparation: 4,800 $APE\n    * Technical Support and Maintenance: 4,800 $APE\n\nThis detailed description of fund allocation will ensure the smooth development, testing, and promotion of both hardware and software products, guarantee the high quality and user satisfaction of the final product.\nWe do not have an estimate of costs for users to use the app’s features at the moment; we will know the cost range once the app development is complete and we begin the user testing phase.\n\n##### APECOIN REVENUE MODEL:\nSingle Instance Revenue Forecast\n\n![Screenshot 2024-07-04 at 4.58.59 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreifltrbdt2idzmxfeipb6il7veqa5nzfw3lagkxvj2hh6snljhq2a4)\n    \n##### Total Revenue:* 120,000 $APE + Total Revenue * 1%\n\nThis table clearly outlines the revenue forecast for a single instance, providing a comprehensive view of the potential earnings from our proposed solution.\n\n*50% of gross revenues will be returned to APECOIN DAO, in perpetuity.\n\nNOTE:\n* Fees will be charged for the services provided by the check-in solution and “Unmanned check-in” model, and only $APE will be used for payment.\n* Offline merch stores adopting the “Unmanned check-in” model can only be paid with $APE.\n* NFC customization will be charged separately and paid for using $APE.\n* $APE will be consumed in the APP as Gas fee\n\nBy implementing this proposal, APECOIN will establish a robust check-in solution that benefits NFT holders, drives revenue growth, and expands its influence in the web3 space.\n\n\n\n### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-450-nft-event-check-in-solution-based-on-apechain/24230\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "BIP 004 - Acquire 3 Nonconformist (Nonco) Ducks NFTs for Networking, IP, Perks, and More",
      "content": "INTRO\n\nDuckmaster’s first NFT was an OG Bull. He’s shown supportive replies to Council interacting with him on X. He’s also built an impressive ecosystem, Ducks being the cornerstone. \n\nLike most OG collections that are still active, Ducks have a wide variety of ways to get value out of participation. While this acquisition is, initially, about networking, IP use, and a longer hold investment, it opens the door for CW and thus holders to enjoy more granular perks, too. \n\nPROPOSAL\n\nAcquire 3 Nonco Ducks for up to .15 ETH total.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n\n[LINK TO VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ha7j6GOIDR8)\n\nThe Open Metaverse unlocks the ability for gamers to move from one experience to another and take their data with them. This enables much deserved freedom for gamers but creates new challenges for platforms to engage and retain them.\n\nIn this decentralized world, Other Page is a Player Network and Rewards Platform centered around the one place gamers always return: Their Avatars.\n\nOther Page consists of 3 primary components:\n\n1. Avatar system - Create your avatar profile page. Avatar profiles enable one-click connect to any integrated experience or application and enable you to own and flex your legacy across the Open Metaverse. Other Page currently supports 16 different PFP collections as avatars and an additional 40 different NFT collections with more on the way.\n\n![img](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/17ecef79ec3e66b3666be1b8493a0027b28f37d1.png)\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/18dac90fa5bf98ac35d81fc1d5a348968b285306.jpeg)\n\n2. Community system - Community relationship management (CRM) dashboard that enables projects/games and their sub-communities to manage their members & increase engagement.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/fc32910aa454b9f603148546062044000ca11dc4.png)\n\n3. Rewards system - A decentralized and permissionless system enabling projects, games, and communities to reward their members with tokens and NFTs (enabled by [AIP-326](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-326-platform-to-enable-apecoin-powered-payments-rewards-for-apps-games/17725) )\n\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/9f8de141d957a22561ac27d6beec8d9cb1b463ee.png)\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nOther Page will drive value to the ApeCoin & ApeChain ecosystems in several ways:\n\n1. Promote the usage of ApeCoin - help players discover and transact with the various games built on ApeChain, thus generating additional transaction fees for ApeChain.\n2. Facilitate ApeChain user onboarding - currently we have around half of the active gaming ecosystem within the Yugaverse using our platform. Other Page Connect, our SSO solution, makes wallet creation and connection to any game/project painless. New accounts are airdropped ApeChain $APE to prevent the need to bridge their first ApeCoin.\n3. Improve discovery - the community management, game discovery features, and on-chain badges will enable better discovery, leading to better monetization, and increased revenue back to ApeChain & the ApeCoin DAO.\n4. Facilitate achievements & reward distribution - using ApeCoin as the default reward token for the platform. Rewards and on-chain badges help incentivize players and games to use ApeChain.\n\nCustomer Journey\n![img](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/d/dfb168edb554c735576942a1c06748ebcef78d9a.png)\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n\nTotal Budget: $1.03M USD + 100k ApeCoin\n* $1.03M USD for product, marketing, & legal\n* 100k ApeCoin for community onboarding\n\nProduct Design & Development: $570k\n* Software Requirements & Technical Architecture: $50,000\n* UI/UX: $40,000\n* Canopy product integration: $70,000\n    * Smart Contract development (Port to ApeChain): $50,000\n    * Infrastructure integration into Other Page Dashboard: $20,000\n* Devops / Infrastructure Development to support new features: $70,000\n* Front-End Development & Integration (New Features): $110,000\n* Back-End Development & Integration (New Features): $150,000\n* ApeCoin distribution automation: $20,000\n* Testing & QA: $60,000\n\nInfrastructure & Maintenance Costs: $90k\n* Infrastructure Hosting Costs: $50,000\n* Blockchain Indexing / Data Storage: $20,000\n* Maintenance, bug fixes & support: $20,000\n*Provides an estimated 1 year of coverage.\n\nSecurity Audits: $100k\n* Smart Contract audits (Internal & 3rd Party): $50,000\n* Security & penetration testing (Internal & 3rd Party): $50,000\n\nMarketing: $150k\n* Business development & partnerships: $90,000\n* Community management: $30,000\n* Operations & Misc: $30,000\n\nLegal & Advisory: $120k\n* Professional support to ensure compliance, proper setup for on-chain mechanics, and proper design and management for the $APE account distributions.\n*Third party advisors only, listed advisors on this AIP will not be compensated.\n\nCommunity: 100k APE\n* 100,000 APE distributed to new & existing Other Page accounts as ApeChain APE to streamline onboarding. ApeChain $APE will be deposited into new users’ wallets to be spent within ApeChain ecosystem activations (e.g. games & apps).\n* Automation will be created to distribute 10 ApeCoin per account with sybil attack mitigation.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-434-resubmission-other-page-a-player-network-rewards-hub-for-apechain/23786\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE: The BOTB DAO Snapshot is a mirrored version of the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot.\nMembers will vote with BOTB NFTs on our BOTB DAO Snapshot. Delegated voting will then be done on the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot with the botbape.eth wallet.\nRead, research, discuss - See what you think, fellow BOTBs! Make your voices heard.**",

With this, every holder has a one-stop resource to fully utilize the BAYC IP.`\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/f90859d9a3798a0924d166fe56af0d9661dd05a3.png)\n\nSource : Official BAYC profile page, YugaLabs\n\nApeFacingApes already is an established project, approved by many renowned community members. It is operating under the MBA license #118. Now it is time to make it available to all 10k Apes. OG holders will of course be fully refunded.\n\nWe roughly estimate 3 new assets per month and in total 108 for 3 years. There will be slots allocated, which we will fill with own creations, creations for MBA projects and creations for Ape communities. MBA projects and communities can apply for a slot through our ticketing system in Discord.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/58f7bd8c5545cf3699c94d57d9088365e14cc461.png)\n\nSource: X, community posts\n\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/2/2eae5d92aba9f66ac83619cb39943ddb7e2a8697.jpeg)\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nNOT JUST A DERIVATIVE:\nWe are bringing value to the original BAYC community.\nIP usage of BAYC is the critical element that provides long-term value to holders. The higher the brand recognition, the more valuable the brand and associated businesses.\nWith an increased IP usage and higher brand recognition, the whole Ape and Apecoin ecosystem will benefit.\n\n![img5](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/75738dc1a11d36655dadc6df19e12d7fc6ee53f3.jpeg)\nSource: X, @0xClawd, example for increased marketability\n\nBRAND RECOGNITION:\n\"The extent to which a target audience can identify or recall a brand based on its visual identity.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n\nLaughing Ape won’t just talk about “Mass Adoption” of $APE and $APE Chain as theoretical possibilities, WE WILL ACTUALLY BRING ABOUT MASS ADOPTION TO THE NORMIES who will use $APE for their everyday Laughing Ape purchases and perks.\n\nWhat’s the point?\n\nComedy Clubs, events, and content distribution are stuck in the past using the same tired old methods they used decades ago and yet it’s still a multibillion dollar a year industry.\n\nLaughing Ape will bring live stand-up performance kicking and screaming into the present and the future utilizing live-streaming, Metaverse simulcasting and NFTs/Blockchain to enhance the performances, merch offerings and distribution models.\n\nWe’ve already shown you how much fun a Laughing Ape event can be, now we’re asking for the funding to take our concepts and build a global comedy performance and distribution empire!\n\nWe’re proud of our accomplishments and footprint in Web3 and now we want to scale our operations to a much larger audience: Comedy lovers who pay to watch comedy, whether they’re in Web2, Web3 or living off the grid, only coming into town for supplies and entertainment,\n\nLaughing Ape will be their number one choice for comedy performance IRL, Live-Streaming, Simulcast in the Metaverse or appearing on their favorite streaming service or movie screen.\n\nIn supporting our AIP, $APE Coin DAO will go down in history as the reason Laughing Ape became the global powerhouse in comedy for many decades to come.\n\nHow will this benefit $APE DAO?\n\nIn addition to getting 6.9% of gross revenue in perpetuity (in other words “4Eva!”), Laughing Ape will make $APE DAO and $APE Coin and even $APE Chain a household name.\n\nSeeing “Powered By $APE Coin” alongside A-list comedians and global, infinitely scaling live events is, dare I say, even more valuable to the DAO than the rev share.\n\nFunding Laughing Ape’s proposal will also show the DAO voters have the appetite to swing big and make things happen.\n\nSure, sitting on a pile of $APE like Scrooge McDuck is fun, but spreading that $APE out into various enterprises that touch, not just Web3, but also communities outside of our great, little community will spread awareness, emotional attachment to our $APE brand and bring new members into our DAO.\n\nIn other words: LFG out and make people fall in love with $APE and making them laugh day in and day out is a valuable way to do it!\n\nTL;DR Again!\n* Massive comedy events streamed live to movie theaters across the globe!\n* Hundreds of Laughing Ape Membership Chapters across the globe with regular comedy events!\n* All events streamed live to a global online audience!\n* The biggest, bestest $APE-themed Comedy Club Metaverse in the world!\n* An international comedy school with online and IRL classes!\n* Check this out: We’re giving $APE Coin DAO 6.9% of Laughing Ape’s revenues for-freaking ever!\n* All shows branded as “Powered by $APE Coin”!\n* We’ll look to collaborate and partner with the best and brightest of Web3 companies/organizations like Mocaverse (Aaron’s a holder), Wicked Craniums/TruSTUB (Aaron’s a holder), BAYC MBA’s (Aaron’s a holder and an MBA License holder), Mocaverse and Sandbox (Aaron’s a Holder of both), JRNY Club (You guessed it, Aaron’s a holder).\n\nNow let’s dive a little deeper, shall we?\n\nLaughing Ape Builds A Global, Freaking Comedy Empire!\n\nFrom exclusive local comedy club shows in cities around the world to massive A-List special events live-streamed to movie theaters, the Metaverse and personal devices globally, Aaron Haber and Laughing Ape, with the help of $APE Coin DAO will revolutionize how comedy is produced, distributed and consumed all while bringing about the mass adoption of $APE/Ape Chain to the normies.\n\nYeah, I said “mass adoption” and I mean “mass adoption” read on!\n\nMassive comedy events streamed live to movie theaters across the globe!\n\nLaughing Ape will produce live-streaming comedy events featuring both household names and up and coming comedians from around the world. We’ll look to partner with major movie theater chains as special events partners.\n\nDue to many challenges the Movie theater exhibitor industry (Aaron Haber is a Movie Theater Exhibition Nepo Baby) is desperately looking for new streams of content.\n\nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour grossed $262 million worldwide without going through the traditional distribution network and instead partnering directly with AMC the world’s largest movie theater chain.\n\nThis was a shocking and shockingly successful deal in the world of movie theater exhibition.\n\nLaughing Ape ain’t Taylor Swift (though we’re total Swifties) but we’re pretty darn sure our comedy events will gross tens of millions of dollars during the lifetime of a similar deal with a chain such as AMC.\n\nHundreds of Laughing Ape Membership Chapters across the globe with regular comedy events!\n\nLaughing Ape will open Membership Chapters in cities across the globe.\n\nEach Chapter can have an unlimited number of members who will pay an annual membership fee.\n\nIn addition to exclusive comedy events. Members will always have first access to shows, events and merch/album drops.\n\nAll current holders of $APE (there will be a snapshot) will get their first year of Laughing Ape Membership for free and become their city’s very first Laughing Ape Fellows (A fancy way of saying “members”).\n\nLaughing Ape Membership allows early access to comedy events, as well as special access to exclusive Laughing Ape events, both IRL, streaming and in the Metaverse. However there is still a ticket charge (discounted) for Members to attend Laughing Ape events and shows.\n\nA certain number of seats will be set aside for current $APE Holders to attend these events for free for at least 1 year.\n\nCheck out these fire designs for Laughing Ape Fellow Club Jackets by Clubhouse Archives!\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/97f04a36c2cdd1b06b212d40f83058cc16feba85.png)\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/e144311b056eebeecb6796773b69ea0036196b14.png)\n\nAll events streamed live to a global online audience!\n\nMost every Laughing Ape show and event will be streamed live behind a paywall and/or token gated solution.\n\nAnyone with a connected device will be able to purchase tickets to these performances.\n\nThere are billions of connected devices around the world.\n\nLaughing Ape Chapter Members can purchase individual streaming tickets or monthly/annual viewing passes.\n\nCurrent $APE Holders (which includes Mocaverse, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild Holders - more to be announced) will gain access to our streaming shows for free for the 1st year.\n\nThe biggest, bestest $APE-themed Comedy Club Metaverse in the world!\n\nThe Club below THE Club, Below Bored is the first and greatest Comedy Club Metaverse launched!\n\nBelow Bored will live stream most, if not all, of Laughing Ape’s comedy events and shows.\n\nCurrent Below Bored NFT Pass Holders will get access to premium spaces within the club.\n\nCurrent $APE Holders (which includes Mocaverse, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild Holders - more to be announced) will be granted free access to Below Bored for at least 1 year.\n\nAn international comedy school with online and IRL classes!\n\nAaron Haber has taught comedy to hundreds of students all around the world including Comedy Masterclasses at Princeton University.\n\nLaughing Ape’s Comedy School will use Aaron’s syllabi to establish its online comedy school.\n\nLaughing Ape Members will get a discount on all classes.\n\n$APE Holders (which includes Mocaverse, JRNY Club, Surreal Guild Holders - more to be announced) will have access to audit the classes and discounts should they want to participate fully in the class.\n\nWe’re giving $APE Coin DAO 6.9% of Laughing Ape’s revenues for-freaking ever!\n\nLaughing Ape will give $APE Coin DAO 6.9% of revenue in perpetuity (like, 4eva, Brah!)\n\nOriginally we were going to give 5% but rounded up to the next sexiest percentage available.\n\nAll shows branded with “Powered by $APE Coin!”\n\nAll shows and events will be branded with “Powered By $APE Coin!”.\n\nThis included streaming events at movie theaters, festivals, concert halls, arenas, everything.\n\nWhile we’re Web3 denizens (and degens) at heart, we’ll be getting the $APE brand in front of a tremendous amount of Normies coming to our shows and events and consuming our content.\n\nPlease find the revised budget and projections below:\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/13744196ee14e8c2f3cbbaf3136ff084110cf39b.png)\n\n[You can find a full budget breakdown here]\n(https://medium.com/@aaron_15091/laughing-apes-aip-424-full-budget-breakdown-16902935a58d)\n\nSources and Uses of Funds:\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/a/a1b563926fe766a9dfeef915307853c45d54297c.png)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\n[Please continue reading the rest of this AIP on the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot and Discourse]\n\n------------ Important Note for BOTB NFT voters --------------\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Unfortunately, due to the character limit of the BOTB Snapshot, the AIP contents on ApeCoin DAO Snapshot could not be fully duplicated here. \n\nTherefore, please read the full AIP contents on the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot and Discourse before casting your vote on the BOTB Snapshot:\n\nApeCoin DAO Snapshot link: https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0xc5e8ce3874a567491c2176d3bf82c2d701d82a9bb721b11942777beeab874255\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-424-laughing-ape-builds-a-global-freaking-comedy-empire/23330\n\nThank you very much for your kind understanding.\n\n** The BOTB DAO Snapshot is a mirrored version of the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot.\nMembers will vote with BOTB NFTs on our BOTB DAO Snapshot.

      "title": "AIP-440: Enhancing Exposure of Brands that accept ApeCoin as payment: Unboxing Web3 Partnership Proposal ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n\nApeCoin is a promising concept with significant potential, but for ApeCoin to truly flourish, its utility needs to expand. Increasing ApeCoin adoption as a payment option for brands is essential for enhancing its utility. Brands that integrate ApeCoin as a payment option should be rewarded, and those that haven’t yet should be encouraged to do so. This proposal not only rewards current brands accepting ApeCoin but also motivates other brands to follow suit. Currently, over 400 Made By Apes (MBA) brands exist, but not many accept ApeCoin—this needs to change.\n\nWith a proven track record of crafting high-quality content and showcasing the work of builders within the space, our objective is to leverage our skills to elevate all brands operating within Web3.\n\n![img](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/521b37426fa20c919d3d739c3e6d7cf713978f62.jpeg)\n\nTo achieve this, we will categorize our approach into several key areas:\n* Editing & Production\n* Time Compensation\n* Product Acquisition\n\nOur mission begins with establishing a content calendar that spotlights individual brands that accept ApeCoin, with a priority for Made By Apes brands. This involves setting transparent guidelines, managing brand expectations, fostering meaningful partnerships, and generating content for the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nThe Unboxing Web3 team has already featured numerous brands within the ApeCoin ecosystem. This is achieved by collaborating with brands that accept ApeCoin as currency, showcasing the physical products they offer as digital-native brands.\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/b/bffe23076241385d96493603843aff0a9944d603.jpeg)\n\nThe desired outcomes include:\n\n* Creating content for brands that may lack resources.\n* Producing high-quality content for increased exposure.\n* Developing a transparent content calendar with deadlines for deliverables.\n* Producing a series of videos that spotlight builders that are utilizing ApeCoin as an option to purchase.\n* Apecoin logo in all videos produced for this series, to represent sponsorship “powered by Apecoin”\n* Supporting builders within the Apecoin ecosystem by purchasing and showcasing their products.\n* Giveaways of selected brands to increase exposure.\n\nWe propose to continue creating Unboxing videos for as many brands that accept ApeCoin as possible, without cost to the brands themselves. Each Unboxing episode will educate viewers on the project and its products, providing guidance on how to follow and purchase these products, with an emphasis on using ApeCoin as the chosen currency.\n\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nThe ApeCoin focused Unboxing Web3 series aligns with the ApeCoin DAO’s mission to foster community-led projects that inject culture into the metaverse. This series will bring exposure to brands that accept ApeCoin and ApeCoin-funded projects by narrating the stories of these brands, and showcasing their products or services.\n\nBy highlighting successful Apecoin accepting projects, this initiative will:\n* Amplify the marketing efforts of these brands, raising awareness within the community and beyond about products and services that accept ApeCoin as payment.\n* Drive adoption of all brands utilizing IP from brands accepting of apecoin by presenting real-world examples of its successful integration into business. i.e. Animoca Brands, Yuga Labs, etc.\n* Generate revenue for brands through increased sales resulting from video content showcasing purchasing instructions and in-depth product/service reviews.\n* Offer valuable exposure for featured projects and the individuals behind them, promoting their ventures and attracting new customers or potential investors.\n* Attract new members to projects using their IP by showcasing diverse creative opportunities for IP use cases.\n* Enhance internal and external communication with these brands and increase community engagement with them.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/1f002ea07eb0f89048157e039ceaba050b9de6ab.jpeg)\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n\nThe total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $97,400 USD.\n\nThis budget proposal requests an allocation of $Ape Tokens equivalent to $97,400 USD to cover Unboxing Web3’s operational needs, specifically for the production and marketing of the 78 videos over 12 months as detailed in this proposal.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/c/c338012f24c9266c66d59e0c657fc24a1fcd01c3.png)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-440-enhancing-exposure-of-brands-that-accept-apecoin-as-payment-unboxing-web3-partnership-proposal/23816\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE: The BOTB DAO Snapshot is a mirrored version of the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot.\nMembers will vote with BOTB NFTs on our BOTB DAO Snapshot.

      "content": "### ABSTRACT\n\nThis proposal requests funding to support the long-term sustainability and growth of ApeChain through the creation of the “Banana Program”, with two complementary initiatives:\n* a Commercial Agreements Initiative; and\n* a User Incentives Initiative\n\nThe Commercial Agreements Initiative is tasked with negotiating commercial agreements with projects, companies and protocols committed to building on ApeChain. These commercial agreements will cover a wide array of structures and incentive models, including the possibility of revenue shares, collaborations, and other ownership arrangements. However, a key commonality will be that the terms of the commercial agreements will provide value to the ApeCoin DAO.\n\nThe commercial agreements may also incentivize builders to use community and stakeholder intellectual property in games, activations and/or protocols utilizing ApeChain, and to integrate ApeCoin into game and protocol economics on ApeChain.\n\nAny proceeds generated from the commercial agreements will be redirected back into the overall budget for the programs so that this will become a reusable source of funding for supporting and growing ApeChain. Proceeds may come in various forms, such as tokens, revenue share (fiat or crypto), stock, or assets. Given that each of these will need to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis (e.g. what wallet would crypto revenue share be transferred to), the Special Council will determine for each Commercial Agreement how the proceeds will be returned to the Banana Program for continued use during the two year term, or returned to the ApeCoin DAO.\n\nSimilarly, the User Incentives Initiative (as detailed further below) will distribute user incentives with the goal of proportionally growing the network, and may be used as a part of the overall package when negotiating the core economic terms of the commercial agreements.\n\nThe Advisory Committee will oversee both programs, including providing endorsements for commercial agreements that will be subject to Special Council veto-authority. The Advisory Committee will be initially composed of the \nmembers noted above, and will be supported in day-to-day operations by a Program Facilitator and Strategic Accounts Manager.\n\nThis proposal will create a vibrant and attractive environment for game publishers and developers, DeFi protocols, and others seeking to build on ApeChain. The commercial agreements will aim to create a steady stream of future revenue and value, empowering the ApeCoin DAO to continue funding growth many years into the future.\n\nThis proposal will Bolster ApeChain Network Activity through New Allocations (BANANA). This is the BANANA Bill: Apes Gotta Eat.\n\n### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n\nWe anticipate that the ApeCoin DAO will receive ongoing revenue from capturing around 77.5% of the fees generated from user activity on ApeChain. As such, ensuring the chain’s success should be a top priority of the DAO.\n\nAdditionally, the chain’s growth will offer other valuable opportunities for the DAO, including but not limited to airdrop negotiations, bridge liquidity with associated fee capture, and increased utility for $APE.\n\n##### (1) User Incentives Initiative for ApeChain\n\nThe User Incentives Initiative will provide a pool of rewards for users of ApeChain. This initiative will focus on growing the ApeChain ecosystem by educating and encouraging users to try out different dApps, with the goal of a larger proportion of rewards being allocated to dApps that most strongly contribute to the sustainable growth of ApeChain. This initiative will also focus on indirectly growing the ApeChain ecosystem by incentivizing the creation of dApps, community intellectual property, and other content on ApeChain.\n\nThe initiative will be overseen by the Advisory Committee with support from the Program Facilitator and Strategic Accounts Manager. The responsibilities of the Advisory Committee include:\n* Negotiating the size and methods of distribution of incentives through dApps.\n* Creating and managing user incentive analytics, such as growth and adoption metrics, to measure the benefits of the incentives\n* Identifying industry leading incentive distribution methods and implementing them on ApeChain.\n\n##### (2) The Commercial Agreements Initiative for ApeChain\n\nThe Commercial Agreements Initiative will facilitate the seamless creation of bespoke commercial agreements with companies and individuals that want to utilize ApeChain. The Advisory Committee may also leverage the User Incentives Initiative to optimize the terms of the commercial agreements. This initiative will be overseen by the Advisory Committee, with day-to-day support from the Program Facilitator and Strategic Accounts Manager. The responsibilities of the Advisory Committee in overseeing the Commercial Agreements Program include:\n* Reviewing Proposals: reviewing proposals for commercial agreements submitted by applicants, including the potential for value accrual for the ApeCoin DAO.\n* Assessing Alignment with Ecosystem Growth Strategy: Beyond purely economic analysis, evaluating whether the proposed commercial agreements align with the mission, strategy, and values of ApeChain and the ApeCoin DAO. They may only endorse partnerships or collaborations that benefit the ApeCoin DAO and advance its objectives.\n* Financial Analysis: analyzing the financial aspects of proposed commercial agreements, including:\n    * Potential for value accrual\n    * Costs\n    * Profitability\n    * Sustainability\n* Risk Assessment: Conducting risk assessments of each proposed commercial agreement. This involves evaluating potential risks and benefits, assessing financial implications, legal considerations, reputational risks, and any other factors that may impact ApeChain.\n* Due Diligence: Performing due diligence on potential partners or collaborators to ensure their credibility, reliability, and suitability for the proposed commercial agreement. This may include background checks, financial analysis, and assessment of past performance.\n* Legal Review: In collaboration with legal counsel, reviewing proposed commercial agreements under applicable laws, regulations, and policies.\n* Decision Making: Based on their evaluations and assessments, recommending which commercial agreements to enter, which are subject to veto by the Special Council of the APE Foundation.\n* Monitoring and Oversight: Once commercial agreements are approved and implemented, providing ongoing monitoring and oversight to monitor compliance with agreed-upon terms and objectives. The Advisory Committee may periodically review performance metrics, financial reports, and other relevant information to assess the effectiveness and impact of the agreements.\n* Reporting: The Advisory Committee charter will be made public, and each quarter there will be a transparency report disclosing the total amount allocated that quarter, and outlining which commercial agreements have been made (but not the specific terms of each agreement), subject to any duties of confidentiality negotiated with the counterparty in the commercial contract.\n\n### OVERALL COST \n\n>> ##### Total: 100 Million ApeCoin with target allocations to the following initiatives:\n\nUser Incentives Initiative: 23 Million APE in total Commercial Agreements Initiative: 73 Million APE in total Administrative Budget: 2 Million APE per year, to be paid Quarterly\n* Advisory Committee: up to 1,250,000 APE\n* Program Facilitator (including all team members): up to 300,000 APE\n* Strategic Accounts Manager (including all team members): up to 450,000 APE\n\nThe Program Facilitator and Strategic Accounts Manager will rely on additional team members and resources at their respective companies to perform all of their responsibilities as needed, staying within the Administrative Budget allocated above, with any changes subject to Special Council approval.\n\nThe administrative budget is also meant to cover any incidental costs related to the management of the program, including compensation for the Regional Community Advisors. The administrative budget is currently estimated at 2% of the total budget annually and should not exceed 3%. Note that this administrative budget is an estimate, and may be higher or lower depending on the number of Advisory Committee members.\n\nThe compensation paid to each eligible Advisory Committee member will be based on their experience and skillset. However, in all cases, the total amount paid to any individual Advisory Committee member will not exceed 250,000 APE per-year, and all compensation will be subject to a 50% one-year lockup.\n\n>> ##### Specifically Approved Limitations:\n\n* Yuga Labs may not receive any funds from the Banana Program, whether under the Commercial Agreements Initiative or the User Incentives Initiative\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\n[Please continue reading the rest of this AIP on the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot and Discourse]\n------------ Important Note for BOTB NFT voters --------------\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Unfortunately, due to the character limit of the BOTB Snapshot, the AIP contents on ApeCoin DAO Snapshot could not be fully duplicated here.

      "content": "Author: Derek (@DerekOnTheBlock)\n\n**INTRO** \n\nThere has been a lot of conflict as to what constitutes an acceptable (professional) proposal, as well as what etiquette to follow when posting a community-wide vote on Snapshot. \n\nThis BIP aims to lay out clear prerequisites for submitting all future proposals and make suggested practices into concrete rules for Council members. \n\n**PROPOSAL**\n\n**Prerequisites**\n\nBIPs published on Snapshot must include: \n1) BIP Number \n2) Author(s)\n3) Three Sections \n       A) Intro / Historical Background / Abstract \n       B) Proposal \n       C) Objective / Summary \n\nAny Snapshot poll lacking any of these 3 prerequisites will be rejected or considered null and void if published. \n\n**Proposal Process** \n\nAny holder can submit a draft proposal in the Bullpen on discord (or updated designated channel if/when available) whenever they like. \n\nIn lieu of BIP number, start proposal with “**DRAFT**” and then follow prerequisites 2 and 3. \n\nSubmitters must also 1) ping @CouncilMember in the proposal draft and 2) state how long draft is open for feedback. Minimum 7 days. \n\n**Council Express Option** \n\nThis clause, which is a separate voting option (2), would give Bull Council 3.0 the ability to publish snapshot polls without the 7-day delay. \n\nUnder Council Express, any of the 7 Core members can submit a proposal inside Council’s private discord channel. If/when they reach 4 Core upvotes, the author(s) can publish the BIP immediately. \n\n**Duration** \n\nBIPs will run no less than 7 and no more than 30 days. The holder who submits the proposal gets to choose duration within this range. \n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nThe need for a standardized BIP process on Snapshot has resulted in a lot of bad blood. This proposal ensures something like that cannot happen again. \n\nLet’s make it simple for any community member to submit a BIP to make BOTB even better.",

      "title": "AIP-433: APE EXPRESS - Next Gen degen tools for building instantly on ApeChain ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nApe Express aims to launch the ultimate toolkit for a thriving memecoin ecosystem on ApeChain, empowering users with the tools they need to create, customize and deploy tokens on ApeChain.\n\nWith Ape Express no technical skills are needed for safe, unruggable launches. Configure and deploy your token with multiple features in seconds.\n\nStreamlined liquidity management: borrow, deploy, and lock liquidity effortlessly. Developers can deploy an LP using borrowed capital, and launch a coin with a starting market cap of $15K while spending only $300 out of pocket. \nLiquidity loans can be automatically repaid from token taxes, liquidity, or manual payment.\n\nIn one place users can create their brand identity, deploy tokens, manage liquidity, build and engage their community. (Think Pump.fun on ApeChain, but way better and less trash. For instance, on Pump.fun tokens start with 1K MC, and never have a chance to reach a DEX. With our system, every launch makes it to the DEX of choice and encourages a free open market on ApeChain.)\n\nToken creators will have an option and be encouraged to airdrop portion of their supply to the holders of the blue chip collections of Yuga ecosystem. BAYC/MAYC/BAKC, CryptoPunks, Kodas, Moonbirds and Mocaverse holders.\n\nThis will bring benefit to the holders of these collections and, at the same time, give the upcoming projects an opportunity to reach the high quality user bases that are the lifeblood of these collections.\n\nAll of these processes are streamlined in the dapp so that anyone can do it with a few clicks of a button.\n\nThis project aims to expand the ApeCoin ecosystem, increase token velocity, TVL and offer new opportunities for the builders in the ApeChain ecosystem.\n\nNone of the funds requested in this proposal will be spent on development or team salary. This proposal aims to bootstrap platform liquidity and the Ape Express marketing budget.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n1. Ape Express will give 10% of all gross revenue from platform fees back to the Apecoin DAO’s treasury.\n2. Onboarding memecoin degens from other chains and converting this liquidity into $APE.\n3. Boosting APE liquidity pairs: Ape Express encourages users to pair their tokens with $APE by automatically converting ETH, USDT, and other assets used on the platform into $APE. By locking APE in LPs we contribute to the overall TVL of the ApeChain.\n4. Amplifying on-chain activity: by facilitating fast and easy token creation and trading of memecoins, we drive overall transactions volume. Memecoin trading volume on Solana accounts for $1.2B daily, and over $120M in volume on Base chain. We drive transaction volume to the ApeChain native DEX.\n5. Enhancing APE token velocity: gas fees, liquidity loans, and buybacks will all utilize $APE.\n6. Backed by The Crypto is a Fun marketing engine. The apes you see above are some of the most prolific memecoin degens in web3. We have our fingers on the pulse of the space and can push our audience over to ApeChain. We run the #1 daily memecoin spaces on CT best believe we will promote ApeChain and Ape Express to the masses.\n7. With our novel liquidity loan system we will attract aspiring devs because of the low barrier to entry. They don’t need initial liquidity - they just need a dream and that dog in em\n\nLIST of FEATURES:\n1. Token creation\n2. Liquidity loans (initial LP)\n3. Option to airdrop portion of supply to BAYC/MAYC or other Yuga NFTs.\n4. Telegram trading bot - web-facing interface\n5. Liquidity lockers\n6. Airdrop multi sender\n7. Stake APE to earn platform-generated revenue\n8. Competitive leaderboard for hot pairs and contest\n9. Degen Analytic bots\n10. AI Website & brand builder\n\nPLATFORMS & TECHNOLOGIES:\n* Smart contracts for deploying tokens\n* Smart contracts for lending liquidity & liquidity locker built-in\n* Smart contracts and mechanisms for clawing back lent out liquidity\n\nWe have created our own set of contracts which interact with each other, giving as much fluidity and flexibility to the system as possible. Users simply pay for token minting, which is dependent on how many features they are including in the token. This acts as initial revenue for the product to safeguard minor expenses with regard to the deploying costs(the user’s token and other related contracts per product deployed), and liquidity rounding errors from the lending activities.\n\nThere are several ways for users to repay the loans:\n* Direct payment: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, repay a direct 12,500 APE to receive ownership of LP tokens (albeit locked until the lock period is over)\n* Tax Tokens: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, and passively repay 12,500 APE as taxes are generated from the trading activity of the token. All taxes are diverted to repaying the loan until completed. The creator will then receive ownership of the LP, and release it to their creator’s address when the lock period is over.\n* Liquidity Threshold: borrow 10,000 APE in liquidity, and as the liquidity pool grows from net buying activity, a loan with interest is repaid via clawback. This means the user can select a 2x with a 25% interest to repay 12,500 APE when the liquidity pool contains at least 20,000 APE. This approach is generally regarded to be safest when a higher threshold is selected (as high as 5x is available). This process is an automated repayment method.\n\nAnother product is the liquidity locker. All created tokens are automatically opted into this feature with a minimum of 30 days, which begins when the loan is repaid in full. Tokens created outside the platform can also use this feature given they make a small payment in APE tokens. The lock period ranges from 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.\n\nFinally, Ape Express will be equipped with a mass sender contract and UI. This is for any creator wanting to do an airdrop or presale distribution manually.\n\nApe Express’ GTM strategy will include a referral/discount coupon program, initially to be issued by team members. In addition, APE stakers (10k tokens staked and up) will be able to generate their own referral and discount codes customizable up to 20% referral/discount mix.\n\nAn incentive program will also be put into action if approved for a grant. The tokens with the most activity, measured by volume and holders, will be awarded APE tokens every week for the token’s creator/treasury. These metrics are reset every week to further incentivize only currently active projects or new projects to receive such rewards.\n\nAlthough we cant stop people from creating NSFW tickers on a permissionless blockchain we will have measures on our backend to hide any racist, hateful or pornographic material from our leaderboards. We can control what is represented on our platform and we will carefully monitor this to make sure we are in line with Apecoin guidelines\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 750,000 APE.\n\nUse of funds Breakdown:\n* 400K - Reserve for liquidity loans\n* 350K - Marketing and onboarding activity incentives for Ape Express and ApeChain\n    * Contests\n    * Giveaways (SAF spaces, raffles)\n    * Quests\n    * Create educational tutorials\n    * Video content creation\n    * IRL marketing\n    * Ads online (explorers, scanners, tg bots etc)\n    * KOL activations\n    * Gorilla marketing\n    * PR\n\n1.

      "title": "AIP-429: Apechain for Good: Happy Ape Phygital Children’s Book/Plush ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal aims to promote Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z  The Happy Ape, an official MBA #00349, is a premium brand that aims to foster a culture of kindness, compassion and positive mental health in our future generations. This AIP would directly fund the creation of The Happy Ape children’s book and plush, nfc tags, and dapp development on ApeChain creating a unique digi-physical web3 experience for both kids and adults. I believe in the future of ApeCoin and am proudly offering a 20% gross revenue back to the dao based on the initial products sold. With the development of AIP-378 I will use ApeChain and $Ape to create innovative solutions, and integrate them into the products. Bored Labs, LLC. will take on the majority of work that is required, reducing costs needed from the dao and includes but is not limited to, e-commerce site creation [thehappyape.io](thehappyape.io), add $Ape as an accepted payment for our products, develop the majority of ApeChain dapp work, and nfc configuration. All development will be open source and will be fully audited, ideally by boring security dao or in cooperation with Horizen Labs. (edited)\n\nWhat makes any of this special? Our children’s book will be one of the very first web3 books that can not only teach children and parents about the power of the blockchain, but also onboard them as well using ApeChain. The book is fully written and authored by myself. Here is a quick summary of the book below, or skip it for the juicy tech.\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/4/4fa2a982de08cd201b68bfb210630005b085a7f8_2_500x500.jpeg)\n\n“The Happy Ape and his friend journey on a daily adventure, gathering bananas amidst the vibrant jungle. Their routine centers around a central tree housing a precious book where their banana counts are meticulously tallied and stored. When theft of the only book shatters their dreams, The Happy Ape crafts a magical book, uniting the jungle’s apes in trust. With every ape receiving a copy of the newfound magical book, no one could lie, steal or cheat because all books have to agree. All of the ape’s lives changed for the better, The Happy Ape and his friend finally could purchase the coveted bouncy ball, playing happily ever after together.”\n\nSuch an amazing story isn’t it, how can it get any better? I plan on integrating an nfc tag into every book. Thus delivering a digi-physical experience allowing the user to scan the tag with a compatible mobile device and instantly mint a digital version of their book. This will be a seamless cost free user interaction all powered by our ApeChain (kudos Horizen Labs). In order to do all of this I plan on partnering with IYK, a premier supplier of nfc tags in the web3 space. Their mobile app will allow easy access to our digi-physical experience. This requires the development of smart contracts and a dapp on ApeChain. The development will be achieved through Bored Labs, LLC., and will be open source. I believe that open source development leads to better community adoption, security, and transparency. I have many plans for the evolution of our digi-physical experience as well. IYK allows for OTA updates, easy updates to modules introducing the user to new features like unique stories, animations and more. In addition to this experience I will also have an e-commerce site with the ability to purchase the products with $Ape.\n\nTo ensure an unforgettable and joyful experience, I have designed with meticulous attention to detail, a special Happy Ape plush, ensuring they become cherished friends for all. This plush will be approximately 15’’ in length and 6’’ wide. Many plushies are small and not even comfy. Our design ensures a warm, soft, and comfy embrace. The Happy Ape is sure to be a loving companion for so many around the world.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/0/04f1f686c4ab2b5611831c4589006f0963fce7cc_2_462x1000.png)\n\nDigitizing Items\n* Permanently link a 1:1 NFT to a physical Item (shown above irl test)\n* Independently deploy Chips without any knowledge of code\n* Schedule campaigns according to specific groups of Items\n* Configure your digital experience using IYK Modules\n\nSo…“Who are you entrusting valuable DAO funds to, you may wonder, and what qualifies me for it?”\n\nLet me start off by introducing myself. My name is Kevin, I’m 37 and I’m married with 3 kids. 8 yo girl, 6 yo boy, 2 yo girl. I’m a software architect and I’ve been in the web3 space for a few years. I have run a successful software company, Bored Labs, LLC., for 3 years now. I have bookshelves full of children’s books and bags full of plushies. The amount of time I’ve spent reading to my kids and playing with plushies is measured in years! I believe in the power of community and helping others which is why I am here. My passion to share kindness and love back into the world while helping others is what motivates me to do this. I want to provide value back to the various communities connected to apecoin and help them grow as well. I hope that through future collaborations I can work with other communities like bulls on the block and mocaverse to continue creating positive and inspirational children’s books along with animated videos. I believe this is a small stepping stone that will lead to a much larger goal of combining web3 ip use to bring people together.\n\nI added a budget for marketing that will help ensure reach and the success of my brand. Half of the marketing budget will be given back to the buyers of my products. A simple marketing strategy i’ll rely on will be asking product buyers to post images of themselves with my products and reward them with $APE. The other half will be reserved for various marketing efforts as needed.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n Most importantly ApeCoin DAO will be supporting and empowering our future generations through a unique onboarding digi-physical experience that will help amplify innovative solutions on ApeChain. This AIP will help promote the use and growth of ApeChain and $APE by building one of the first dapps that will help onboard many new users and introduce them to ApeCoin. The Happy Ape products aim to give more visibility to the ApeCoin community in a positive light. We will also be reaching a new audience that we haven’t explored much of. Our products support kindness, compassion, and positive mental health which is something we could all use more of.\n\nWe’re offering 20% gross revenue back to the DAO to show gratitude and continued support back to the community. (Detailed under our Overall Cost)\n\nAs a result of this proposal, IYK has promised that they would add ApeChain as a supported chain to their application.\n\nThis would allow anyone using IYK to use ApeChain as their selected chain to mint nfts on. It would help guide the development and use of digi-physical experiences on ApeChain, and directly fund code that is open source leading to better security and adoption starting within our community. We need a better way for fast adoption of ApeCoin.\n\nI will ensure resources like artists/animators are from the ApeCoin community. With many more future books and animated videos I plan to collaborate with more ApeCoin communities. I promise to innovate new ways of incorporating ApeChain and $Ape into our future products as this is just a stepping stone for us. It’s important that we continue development around ApeChain and $APE. I would be honored to have ApeCoin DAO help us cultivate positivity into many lives of our next generation around the world.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $135,460\n\nPlush 5,000 count - $40,756 Children’s Book 5,000 - $43,704 Illustrations - $6,000 NFC Tags 10000 - $10,000 DApp - $15,000 Marketing - $20,000 \nTotal Funding: $135,460\n\nEstimated Gross Rev Return\nMin  Book: 5,000 * 15 = 75,000 * 20% = $15,000 usd  Plush: 5,000 * 20 = 100,000 * 20% = $20,000 usd  Total Rev Share Return: $35,000 usd\n \nMax  Book: 5,000 * 20 = 100,000 * 20% = $20,000 usd  Plush: 5,000 * 30 = 150,000 * 20% = $30,000 usd  Total Rev Share Return: $50,000 usd\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-429-apechain-for-good-happy-ape-phygital-childrens-book-plush/23462\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-432: ApeCoin Presents First Friday: Bridging Communities, Creativity, and Governance ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n“ApeCoin Presents First Friday: Bridging Communities, Creativity, and Governance” encapsulates an unprecedented partnership that signifies more than ApeCoin becoming the presenting sponsor for First Friday events in Las Vegas. We have the opportunity to place ApeCoin at the heart of a cultural gathering that attracts 15,000-20,000 visitors on average, offering unparalleled exposure and the access to creative collaborations within a community rich in art and innovation. This is a six month deal that will run from July-December of 2024, the prime time for this event. We also will be given the opportunity to renew on a longer term basis after this initial six months is completed.\n\nIt heralds a holistic collaboration aimed at enhancing ApeCoin’s visibility and embedding it deeply within the local cultural and artistic milieu. This partnership is a strategic alliance, underscoring a commitment to support communities that resonate with creativity, innovation, and progressive governance. By integrating ApeCoin into these seminal community events, we’re not only expanding our reach but also aligning seamlessly with our core mission to foster an ecosystem where technology and creativity intersect harmoniously. “ApeCoin Presents First Friday” is set to celebrate the fusion of digital innovation with the arts, setting a precedent for the role of Web3 in cultural and community engagement.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThis partnership extends beyond mere sponsorship, bringing multifaceted benefits to the ApeCoin ecosystem, the city of Las Vegas, and its governance framework:\n\nAmplified Brand Exposure and Community Engagement: As the presenting sponsor, ApeCoin secures prime visibility across all First Friday communications, including official banners prominently displayed throughout the event, mentions in press releases, and a dedicated section on the First Friday website with a hyperlink to ApeCoin’s platform. This comprehensive exposure ensures ApeCoin’s presence is palpable, reaching an expansive audience of artists, enthusiasts, and city dwellers.\n\nDedicated Space for ApeCoin and Web3 Exploration: Perhaps the most significant advantage of this partnership is the allocation of a large, dedicated area at each First Friday event. This space will serve as the epicenter for presenting ApeCoin and its array of AIP-approved projects. It’s an opportunity to engage the community directly, showcase the practical applications of ApeCoin, and provide a tangible experience of the possibilities within the Web3 ecosystem. This space also allows us to bring in a swath of presenters, who can use our space to showcase their own aligned initiatives, whether that be web3 driven projects or local initiatives.\n\nStrengthened City and Government Relations: The partnership positions ApeCoin as a cultural and economic contributor to Las Vegas, fostering positive engagements with local government and policy makers. This proactive involvement aims to solidify Web3’s role in the city’s future, advocating for a regulatory environment that champions digital innovation.\n\nFoundation for Additional Local Partnerships: Engaging with First Friday opens the door to numerous collaborations within the Las Vegas community, from cultural institutions to technology innovators. These partnerships will be instrumental in solidifying ApeCoin’s presence and influence in the local ecosystem, driving broader acceptance and integration of Web3 technologies.\n\nCatalyst for Web3-Friendly City Development: Beyond immediate brand visibility, this initiative embodies ApeCoin’s commitment to embedding digital currencies within the social and economic fabric of Las Vegas. By demonstrating the value of ApeCoin through community-centric events, we pave the way for Las Vegas to emerge as a beacon for blockchain and digital currencies, inspiring other cities to explore similar collaborations.\n\nExclusive Benefits as Presenting Sponsor: The array of exclusive benefits, including creative control over the dedicated area, input on featured content and activities, and the ability to highlight ApeCoin’s contributions to the Web3 community, underscores the strategic value of this partnership. It provides a dynamic platform for engaging with a diverse audience, educating them on the benefits of digital currencies, and showcasing the tangible impacts of ApeCoin and its projects on the local community.\n\nIn sum, “ApeCoin Presents First Friday” is a landmark initiative that transcends traditional sponsorship. It’s a comprehensive strategy aimed at fostering long-term engagement with the Las Vegas community, promoting the adoption of Web3 technologies, and establishing ApeCoin as a pivotal force in the cultural, economic, and governance landscapes of Las Vegas. Through this partnership, we envision a future where ApeCoin is integral to the city’s vibrant cultural scene, supported by a governance framework that embraces the transformative potential of digital currencies.\n\nSponsorship Details As the Presenting Sponsor for First Friday, ApeCoin commits to a dynamic and multifaceted involvement, both in terms of what we provide and facilitate. This sponsorship is tailored to leverage ApeCoin’s unique position within the Web3 ecosystem, offering a blend of technological innovation and community engagement at one of Las Vegas’s most anticipated monthly cultural events. Here’s a detailed breakdown of our contributions and facilitations:\n\nDedicated Exhibition Space: ApeCoin will have access to three 10x10 spaces within the event premises, and a prime location at Boulder Plaza of a 30x60 space reserved for interactive activations. This large dedicated area will serve as a hub for showcasing ApeCoin and its other AIP-approved projects, allowing for immersive experiences that include AI NFT digital art collectibles and educational activities powered by ApeCoin.\n\nCreative Collaborations: The space will be utilized to foster creative collaborations, highlighting the intersection of art and technology. It will feature installations and exhibitions from artists within the ApeCoin community, including those focused on digital and NFT art, providing a platform for these artists to gain exposure and engage with a wider audience. We have already had a great interest in these collaborations, so this proposal would allow us to capitalize on these opportunities.\n\nBrand Visibility: As part of the sponsorship agreement, ApeCoin will be prominently featured on official banners and other event marketing materials. This includes the ApeCoin logo on the monthly event poster, displayed across various platforms, ensuring significant brand visibility. Additionally, three banners provided by the sponsor will be strategically placed throughout the event to maximize exposure. These banners may include QR codes to direct attendees to more information about ApeCoin and its ecosystem.\n\nWebsite Affiliation: ApeCoin will be featured on the First Friday website with a hyperlink, facilitating easy access for event-goers interested in learning more about ApeCoin, its values, and its projects. This online presence will be complemented by a dedicated social media post on one of First Friday’s platforms each month, further enhancing ApeCoin’s visibility.\n\nMedia and Press Engagement: The sponsorship ensures ApeCoin a mention in First Friday’s press releases each month, amplifying our reach beyond the physical event to the broader public and media outlets. The presence of ApeCoin in Las Vegas will be difficult to overlook.\n\nPhotos and Videos: Leverage high-tier local production companies to capture professional-grade photos and videos of ApeCoin’s presence and activities during First Friday events. This content will be utilized to further boost ApeCoin’s marketing and community engagement efforts across all digital platforms, showcasing the vibrant interaction between ApeCoin, artists, and attendees.\n\nMarketing Materials to Give Away: Produce and distribute a range of high-quality, visually appealing marketing materials such as brochures, flyers, posters, and ApeCoin-themed merchandise.

      "title": "AIP-413: Hire a Head of Network Development at the APE Foundation ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal aims to hire a Head of Network Development to help oversee matters within theAPE Foundation, supporting our community in achieving its strategic goals and ensuring operational excellence. The Head of Network Development will be responsible for supporting daily operations, facilitating strategic planning, coordinating community engagement, and\nrepresenting the DAO in external affairs. Additionally, this role will be well-positioned to make recommendations for further improvements as needed. For clarity’s sake, this position does not equate to a chief executive officer or “leader”, but rather a critical support function for the APE Foundation and the DAO.\n\nTo optimize efficiency and create cost savings, this proposal also includes a proposed reduction in future Special Council members’ payments to offset the cost of this hire. The APE Foundation will be empowered to oversee the hiring process for this position, ensuring that all legal, tax, and other relevant considerations are thoroughly addressed and optimized. The Head of Network Development will serve at the pleasure of the Special Council, the DAO’s Advisory Board.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nAs ApeCoin DAO continues to expand, the need for ongoing, dedicated, and professional support at the APE Foundation has become increasingly evident. A Head of Network Development will offer essential oversight, strategic facilitation, and operational management, ensuring the ApeCoin DAO fulfills its mission efficiently and effectively. This role is vital for maintaining momentum, building community trust, and ensuring the long-term sustainability of the DAO. Additionally, this position will allow our Special Council to focus on their responsibilities as the Advisory Board they are intended to be.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nUSD $120,000 per annum paid in $APE. However, we will reduce Special Council member payments to offset this cost. Effectively makes this proposal zero additional cost to the DAO up to USD $125,000 once the reduction of the Special Council members payments kicks in (January 1, 2025).\n\nAPE Foundation could use its discretionary authority to go over USD $125,000 per annum if a competitive salary for this role is deemed necessary.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-413-hire-a-head-of-network-development-at-the-ape-foundation/21580\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE: The BOTB DAO Snapshot is a mirrored version of the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot. \n\nMembers will vote with BOTB NFTs on our BOTB DAO Snapshot.

And we will not only support it, but even amplify it.\n\nIntroducing Blever, a cutting-edge web3 platform combining NFTs with social farming & incentivized content creation. The platform empowers teams to effortlessly bring their creations to life while enjoying unparalleled hype & attention. By leveraging social login and seamless FIAT payments, Blever provides easy access to ApeChain not only for experienced users but also for casual players and retail.\n\nIn addition to gaming, you also need fun, culture, memes, and PFPs to make ApeChain appealing and popular. Blever is designed to do just that. We see ourselves as an extended community-driven business development arm. We search for projects, support their launch, and bring them tremendous reach and engagement through social farming. Everyone wins!\n\nWith $APE being the native gas token of ApeChain we believe that bringing users/traffic/projects to the chain is probably the single most important thing the DAO can focus on in the near future.\n\n**Driving demand for ApeChain = Driving demand for $APE**\n\nEasy access to ApeChain → more users on ApeChain → more demand for $APE Incentives on ApeChain → more users on ApeChain → more demand for $APE More use cases on ApeChain → more use cases for $APE ApeChain hype → $APE hype\n\nThis is our biggest opportunity and we want to do everything we can with Blever to make the most of it.\n\nHaving already invested more than 2 months of our time and resources, we are now looking for funding from the DAO to help us achieve our goal. Let’s make ApeChain a success together\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/e/e5869dd3a668ec3756ddfac50ab4cb6e77c6ff3c_2_1380x776.jpeg)\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/b/be2c22a5e6c93bc7acda27e6b51d3ac7068b2f0d_2_1380x776.jpeg)\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nApeChain needs builders, users, fun & culture.\n\nWe aim to become an *ApeChain launch partner.*\n\nConsider us to be an *external business development arm for ApeChain.* Via our platform, we will onboard creators, users, culture & fun to ApeChain. We have already started with outreach to various brands and projects + we have existing/confirmed partnerships as well.\n\n*Maximizing reach & engagement* for projects that launch on ApeChain: easy access to social farming & incentivized content creation will ensure that they get the hype and attention they deserve.\n\n*Easy ApeChain onboarding* with Social Login & FIAT payments\n* Social Login will allow casual gamers & retail to sign up by using their traditional login methods (such as Google, X, Meta, etc.) - no wallet needed.\n* FIAT payments will allow them to pay by Credit Card or other common payment methods.\n* No gas fees - we will cover them on their behalf.\n\nThis combination will enable the simplest, fastest, and smoothest onboarding process for new users! No wallet, no crypto needed - a seamless web2.5 experience for everyone ; )\n\n*Powered by Ape(Chain) branding* - permanently placed in our footer for 1 year.\n\n*Joint marketing efforts* via our points system: we already had initial conversations with ApeCoin DAO members. Imagine $APE & ApeChain all over your timeline ; )\n\n*Stackable multiplier for Apes* and other partner collections like (Kodas, Mocaverse, and more) in all social farming campaigns. Making sure that our fam & frens have a headstart.\n*$APE payments* - all mints on ApeChain will have ApeCoin as their default currency, creating additional demand and utility.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n“Total amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 185,000 $APE”\n\nCost Breakdown:\nPlatform Design & Development: $115,000\n* UX/UI Design: $15,000\n* Front-end: $30,000\n* Back-end: $35,000\n* Smart Contract: $10,000\n* Social Farming Dashboard: $25,000\n\nMarketing & Business Development & Operations: $85,000\n* Marketing & Community: $40,000\n* Biz Dev & Partnerships: $25,000\n* Operations & Miscellaneous: $20,000\n\nLegal: $27,500\n* Legal policies: $20,000\n* Consultation Compliance & AML: $7,500\n\nNote: Our team has borne all costs incurred to date - amounting to a total of approx. $40,000.

      "title": "AIP-416: MAGA - Make Apes Great Again ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal aims to promote Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin to a Web2 audience of millions of Millennials and Gen Z consumers via extremely popular and influential social media personalities on Instagram, Tik Tok, and Youtuber. The goal is to create awareness within the normies and introduce them to the Bored Ape Yacht Club as the best club in the world despite not having a club or any yachts, and that ApeCoin is the future of finance that will lead to financial freedom despite not having any utility or real world use cases.\n\nBy Achieving this goal we hope to increase demand for Apes and get hundreds or maybe even thousands of normies to come buy our bags. If we can convince them into truly believing that Apes, Mutants, and ApeCoin are cool, we hope they will buy them to be a part of this great community with no interest of ever selling for a profit, resulting in an increased holder count. This can potentially get Apes out of the hands of Blur farmers and traders who only buy Apes to flip them for a 0.01 eth profit (or loss).\nMAGA - Make Apes Great Again\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nIncreased holder count… This may or may not bring in a few thousand new ApeCoin bag holders.\nNew community members and DAO participants… We may or may not get a few thousand new plebs to complain about how down bad they are.\n\nMore hate and ridicule… We may get a bunch of people to make fun of and talk bad about Apes. But there’s no such thing as bad publicity right? Whether the things they say are good or bad they will be talking about us.\n\nThe idea is to convince the normies that Apes are cool and they need to be like us. To make them realize that the Bored Ape Yacht Club is the best club in the world and they need to join this club asap before they can no longer afford to join.\n\nThe only way to find out if it works is to FAFO. The more we FA, the more we FO. If we don’t FA, we’ll never FO.\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/f1323247eea99118febfcb3e55c68dd99d4abfd6.jpeg)\n\nThe one benefit I can guarantee for sure is that 1000 community members will get to claim a free Twisted Ape Treasure Chest. I have 1000 of these Treasure Chests in stock and ready to ship. They are currently priced at 69 $APE, but if this AIP is approved, I will make them a free claim to the first 1000 wallets that vote on this AIP, regardless whether they vote yes or no.\n\nWe will also include delegated voters. If you delegate your votes to another wallet or are part of a sub community that votes separately such as Surreal or Mocaverse, our dev team will get all your wallet addresses from the snapshot and include you in the free claim.\n\nI will post the winners of these Chests here on the forum as well as on X and Discord. I will ensure everyone finds out about it by making public announcements on as many Twitter spaces as I can get on. We will not request any personal information directly, however the claim will be made on our Shopify website with the standard checkout process similar to every other ecommerce store on Shopify. So mailing addresses will be as safe as they usually are as with any other order users place online.\n\nIf there are less than 1000 voters and delegates and we have some leftover Treasure Chests, then we will make them available for free to all ApeCoin holders via a random raffle system.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/16049e5abe0937b53ab03433ee92e887dac91839.jpeg)\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/4/478f4f231c015f731cb85b3a9be6ff1b156eac6b.jpeg)\n\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/6/6ec1d9d4d140b4fb3d9631ddeb681b1f458e4d43_2_1380x920.jpeg)\n\n![img5](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/optimized/2X/6/6229a2d0442c60f2555e3933010c4853d9b29343_2_1380x776.jpeg)\n\nLearn more about Twisted Ape at [TwistedApe.xyz](TwistedApe.xyz)\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n69,420 $APE\n\nThe entire 69,420 $APE will be used to create content and hire influencers to make Apes and ApeCoin go viral on social media.\n\nWe will allocate an average of 10,000-12,000 $APE per month, for approximately 6 consecutive months, until all the funds have been depleted.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-416-maga-make-apes-great-again/22804\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-401: Guidelines for Request for Proposals (RFP) ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThe following is a proposed guidelines and clarity for the how ApeCoin DAO is to conduct a Request for Proposals (henceforth known as RFP).\n\nThe recent [ApeChain RFP](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/apechain-request-for-proposals/21139) has brought forth a need to adequately explain the conditions and rules governing how an RFP is to be conducted, under what circumstances, and what the voting structure is.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nAs best understood, there have been three executed RFPs in ApeCoin DAO History:\n* [An RFP in response to AIP-21 and AIP-22](https://twitter.com/apecoin/status/1550616722809536512), in which Horizen Labs was selected.\n* An [RFP for selecting a Cayman Islands Administrator](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0x5222214e742168df0297589a78b3bd346159fe88f89f536d4f273fe315f23c8c) as a result of [AIP-196](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-196-bored-aip-bringing-order-and-reliability-via-ecosystem-decentralization/10160) that was approved and explicitly stated that it would perform said RFP.\n* The [ApeChain RFP](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/apechain-request-for-proposals/21139). While the RFP retroactively had the [ApeChain Poll/Vote](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0xe26b5ec8c8d1d03c9ba5b4c53e8d9aa1dc38d2f4b6c44dd9c41643b11fb2b645) to decide if the [ApeChain RFP vote](https://snapshot.org/#/apecoin.eth/proposal/0xff1829f8e2fb778946ef83050858a54582da50da3de3acb67c74f5e38c1da0aa) would proceed, it still carried the same weight of whether the ApeChain RFP vote would proceed.\n\nIt was during the ApeChain RFP that the community realized that we do not have a proper framework and a understanding of the RFP process and that needed to change. As such this AIP is designed to inform the community and those who wish to pursue an RFP the steps necessary to conduct one.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nThe overall cost for this proposal is expected to be zero.\n\nAs noted in the Steps to Implement, in the event of an accepted RFP Recommendation, the Foundation would be required to set aside the requested maximum budget (as specified in the “Budget Range” of the RFP Recommendation). Any excess funds not ultimately awarded to the accepted vendor are to be returned to the Treasury.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-401-guidelines-for-request-for-proposals-rfp/21510\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE: The BOTB DAO Snapshot is a mirrored version of the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot.

      "title": "AIP-428: MBA Documentary Series: Showcasing the Entrepreneurs, Creatives & Networking within BAYC ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThe Made By Apes program is fantastic, but there isn’t enough exposure for the builders pushing our ecosystem forward. I’m seeking funds to produce a series of short documentaries highlighting MBA businesses and the networking that ties apes, ApeCoin, the DAO and MBAs together.\n\nFor the core of the series, I will travel to 3 major hubs for MBAs: LA, NYC and Miami, filming 3-5 businesses and a networking event in each city. Each featured business & meetup will have its own approximately 5-10 minute long episode and a short teaser. The first episode will debut about 1 month after shooting begins, with a new episode released every 3-4 weeks.\n\nI will feature MBAs from many industries and show a variety of use cases and business strategies. Small boutiques like Frens Chocolate and international brands like Bored & Hungry have compelling stories, as do projects with existing links to ApeCoin such as the Bored Brewing Company, Aaron Haber’s Laughing Ape, and the Bored Ape Gazette, a potential distribution partner for this series. The Bored Trading Co’s unique model helps smaller MBAs distribute products at events across the world, an example of the synergy being created every day by apes, MBAs & the ApeCoin DAO, something that deserves far more attention. An episode featuring Horizen’s launch of ApeChain would be a unique opportunity to take control of the narrative and show tangible community and business utility within the ApeCoin DAO & BAYC.\n\nAs a gesture of my commitment, I’m proposing that full ownership of the completed pieces along with any streaming and distribution revenue belong to the DAO itself. Also, I will only work on this project for the entire term, collaborating with apes every step of the way, from selecting featured MBAs to hiring apes for music and organizing MBA meetups.\nI’ve believed in BAYC’s potential as a modern social club since the day I minted. This series will celebrate the businesses and social capital being created by MBAs with the help of apes and the ApeCoin DAO.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThis series aligns with the ApeCoin DAO’s mission to foster community led projects that drive culture forward into the metaverse. Entrepreneurship and IP have been a part of BAYC’s culture since the beginning, and Made By Apes is the next evolution. This series will bring much needed exposure to ApeCoin funded projects, highlighting the DAO’s impact in the real world and showing various ways apes have integrated BAYC into their own expressions of culture, from food & beverage to arts & entertainment.\n\nBy showcasing successful MBA & ApeCoin projects, it will:\n* Add to the sense of professionalism & community in the ApeCoin DAO by showcasing skilled creatives & entrepreneurs, including those who have already received ApeCoin funding.\n* Potentially increase demand for ApeCoin & ApeChain by demonstrating their ties to the BAYC community and showcasing real-world use cases for the tokens.\n* Show outsiders that BAYC is more than just a jpg one can right click ‘n save, but rather a passionate community of skilled entrepreneurs building in the real world across industries.\n* Educate apes on how they can leverage the MBA program for their own pursuits, providing concrete examples and inspiration for those looking to commercialize their IP or use ApeCoin in their projects.\n* Provide valuable exposure for the featured projects and the apes behind them, promoting their ventures and attracting new customers or even potential investors.\n* Show the power of networking & diversity of skills in BAYC to foster more collaboration within the community, and facilitate IRL networking via the meetups in each city.\n* Attract new members to the BAYC & ApeCoin communities by highlighting the unique opportunities for IP commercialization and the supportive nature of the ape community & DAO, both online and in real life.\n\nBy providing a behind-the-scenes look at the innovative ways apes are utilizing their IP, the Made By Apes series has the potential to drive growth and engagement for the entire BAYC ecosystem.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin DAO = $141,600 USD, to be paid in ApeCoin.\n* LA - 2 weeks; flight, hotel & car = ~$3,000\n* NYC - 2 weeks; flight, hotel & car = ~7,000\n* Miami - 2 weeks; flight, hotel & car = ~$3,000\n* ApeFest - 1 week; flight, hotel & car = ~$3,000\n* Music Licensing & Scoring - $20,000\n\nI will bill my time at $60 / hour, less than industry standard, equivalent to $9600 per month. It’s hard to estimate exactly how long a project like this will take to complete, but on the high end, rounding up to 11 months, my salary would be $105,600. Combined with the travel budget of $16,000 and music budget of $20,000 we reach a total of $141,600 for 11 months of production covering at least 4 major cities (NYC, Miami, LA, Lisbon).\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-428-mba-documentary-series-showcasing-the-entrepreneurs-creatives-networking-within-bayc/23445\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*\n\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE: The BOTB DAO Snapshot is a mirrored version of the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/2/284052f66cc325e3db2ec6cbf2ab0ddb9efcbc82.jpeg)\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/d/d36bd364e654dffe36719cdd7177f46f197788ae.jpeg)\n\nWith the upcoming launch of ApeChain, the ApeCoin community is taking a leap forward in creating one of the most robust ecosystems in web3-enhanced gaming, with a focus on content and utility to drive delight amongst gamers, reward developers, and increase the usage of $APE. Making it effortless for games to launch, attract players, and scale on ApeChain is fundamental to the ecosystem’s success. Empowering developers (and therefore gamers and usage) requires the right technology and solutions, and Sequence is excited to propose APE Builder as a platform to supercharge the development of games on ApeChain and spur the utility of $APE.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/ee1829da87fe2cc0fd05cf1cc87b42501817f441.png)\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/8/80098f27195e6427e21998b9841d26346b27bdc5.png)\n\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe ApeCoin community put its trust in ApeChain to further the goals of adoption and usage of $APE and reward the ApeCoin DAO and community. Scalable content and utility are widely recognized as the best practices for driving the use of $APE and similar tokens. However, every new chain, including ApeChain, requires comprehensive technology and solutions for developers and creators to build and launch successful, accessible content. APE Builder uniquely solves these needs and allows developers to build rewarding experiences leveraging ApeChain and $APE.\n\n![img5](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/18f2f1d423701e48862903e4b0b3adf4926575b3.jpeg)\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n0 ApeCoin\n\nSequence will not seek any form of compensation from the ApeCoin DAO for the scope of work outlined herein or ongoing support of APE Builder developers in accordance with its access tiers. As mentioned above, APE Builder is free to begin using and creating, with scalable access options for growing projects that align with the incentives of the developer, ApeChain, and the ApeCoin community.\n\nRegarding expectations of the APE Foundation, in helping to realize ApeChain’s goals, we are requesting that the \nFoundation provide:\n\nBranding Authorization\n* The permission to use the phrases “APE Builder,” “powering ApeChain Gaming,” as well as all relevant APE marks, for the branding of APE Builder.\n* Sequence will work with the stewards of the ApeChain website, once they’re chosen, to allocate and maintain a URL for APE Builder. APE Builder will also be accessible via apechain.sequence.build. Finally, we will also work with the maintainers of the ApeChain website to establish an ecosystem page that will contain complementary solutions, including the many already-created tools for the Ape Community.\n* The permission to use the term “ApeKin” as well as all relevant ApeKin marks for use in APE Builder tutorials, UI, and/or marketing materials.\n* ApeKin, ApeChain, and ApeCoin’s marks will only be used for the white labeling of the platform, marketing, and tutorials for APE Builder and not commercialized. The Foundation will retain full ownership of these marks.\n\nFor select partners, Sequence can extend a unique commercial structure which removes all out of pocket costs for developers and instead further aligns the partnership around the success of the game based on primary and secondary sales.\n\nWe are excited to accelerate the adoption of ApeChain and the usage of $APE, and reduce barriers for developers and players to create and enjoy the best games on ApeChain.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-418-ape-builder-developed-by-sequence/23164\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP.

      "title": "AIP-412: Streamlining Working Group Elections: Improved Second-Round Voting Strategy ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis no-cost proposal provides a solution for an element of second-round voting during ApeCoin DAO Working Group elections that currently restricts voters to selecting only one candidate when multiple seats for the same positions are being filled.\n\nTo fix this, we propose changing the Snapshot Strategy to weighted voting, which enables the option to distribute voting power among each of the candidates you wish to see elected.\n\nIt is important to note that we are already using this method of voting in the first-round of Working Group elections. Furthermore, under this format should you favour our existing second-round standard of single-choice voting, you can still concentrate all of your voting power on one candidate. We’re simply offering an alternative for those who wish to have a broader influence across all positions being filled.\n\nExamples of other DAOs that utilize options to help voters to select more than one candidate when multiple seats are being filled include Arbitrum, ENS, and Optimism.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n1. Improved Voter Representation and Accuracy: Under our current second-round voting format, election results do not accurately represent the community’s preferences when filling multiple seats for the same role. Instead, they reflect the community’s favourite, accounting for only one seat.\n\n2. Stronger leadership teams: By obtaining more accurate election results, our Working Groups will be formed more deliberately, empowering the community to have a greater say in selecting the best candidates for the job.\n\n3. Enhanced governance integrity: Elections and voting mechanics are polarizing, intricate components of any governance-operated entity. Yet, by pursuing changes in logical, fair, and meaningful ways, the sentiment within the ApeCoin DAO community toward these processes will be strengthened.\n\n4. Preserving choice while maintaining traditional voting preferences: By shifting to a flexible voting strategy, we can provide options to voters while still maintaining the ability to select only one candidate, ensuring that members who prefer that method can still participate according to their preferences.\n\n5. Promoting inclusivity and increasing opportunities for candidates: Weighted voting in the final round of elections will enable voters to more easily endorse multiple candidates with diverse perspectives simultaneously. This system may also amplify opportunities for qualified candidates who typically need expansive networks to obtain meaningful positions within the ApeCoin DAO Working Group structure.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nThere is no cost to implement this proposal.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-412-streamlining-working-group-elections-improved-second-round-voting-strategy/21502\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nHow would you like to own a piece of the rights to the Joe Rogan’s podcast or the kids show Bluey? That’s what we’re aiming to create with ApeCoin.\n\nWe’re seeking funding to produce audiovisual content in both English AND Spanish, telling stories across various successful genres that resonate with a wide audience. In doing so, we’re not just looking to generate financial benefits for ApeCoin holders by tokenizing these rights; but it’ll also crack open a whole new market: the massive and untapped Spanish-speaking world.\n\nAnd this project not only grants current worldwide ApeCoin holders (and thus ApeCoin DAO members) the right to a proportional share of the IPs and their future earnings, but it also opens up new possibilities for:\n\na)⁠ ⁠Creative professionals and spanish speaking audiences who hadn’t previously considered ApeCoin among their crypto options, who will now be exposed to it through the development and publishing of the IPs.\n\nb)⁠ ⁠Current ApeCoin holders, who are encouraged to increase their holdings to boost their returns through this dual opportunity.\n\nc)⁠ ⁠Furthermore, as all podcasts funded by this AIP will carry the ApeCoin brand, it naturally draws in new potential buyers, spotlighting mass-consumption content to push ApeCoin into the mainstream.\n\nWe expect that this move will expand the APE ecosystem to larger audiences interested in investing and Web3, thereby increasing its recognition and value for all.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n* The APE Community will own 50% of the IPs (including all derivatives, ancillary, royalties and direct income) funded through this AIP; the remaining 50% will be owned by DIXO (25%) and Medios Modernos (25%). By “APE Community,” we specifically refer to the ApeCoin DAO and its members. This community is at the core of our proposal and its intended benefits.\n* With respect to the aforementioned “direct income,” our priority is to first return value back to the Treasury (full $380,050 from gross revenue). We’ll then proceed with the distribution based on the 50-25-25 split among the ApeCoin DAO, Dixo, and Medios Modernos. This is intended to ensure that all parties benefit fairly and equitably in the evolving landscape of decentralization (a philosophy we fully support).\n* While it’s tough to pin down exact timelines before the project kicks off, drawing from our prior experience, we are confident that revenue generation will begin within a year after the release of any podcast under this AIP and possibly less. As an additional note, we are already in talks for a first-look contract with an L.A.-based audiovisual production companies regarding these IPs.\n* Exclusive content to help evangelize and promote APE, Blockchain and Web3 principles and uses.\n* Every podcast episode, will include a mention of the APE Foundation/ApeCoin DAO.\n* Products or Brands accepting ApeCoin and/or Accepted AIP Authors will have a free 20-second spot (as long as the product and/or brand is compliant with the APE Foundation guidelines).\n* Products that aren’t accepting ApeCoin but have a direct relation with the ApeCoin DAO will have a 70% discount of market price (as long as the product and/or brand is compliant with the APE Foundation guidelines). What we’re proposing here is to offer any member of the ApeCoin DAO the opportunity to promote, sell, market, or sponsor their products or services—with a 70% discount of the current ad CPM [cost-per-mille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_mille) market price.\n* After reviewing AIP-274, we’d certainly like to include the “Powered by ApeCoin” logo on the cover art of every IP funded by this AIP, as well as an audio “Powered by ApeCoin” voiceover at the end of each podcast episode, as a part of the credits. This ensures a consistent and visible partnership branding across all media.\n* A real opportunity to create a highly successful and highly profitable worldwide franchise, both in the entertainment industry and in Web3.\n* Future tokenization of IPs that can spinoff to other media, products and entertainment categories that help ApeCoin have a wider use and grow in value.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTOTAL: $380,050 USD\nBudget of 4 IPs:\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/b/b9986a4aae9907f3509210d31a47e865486c3aff.png)\n\nBudget of stand-alone APE and W3 weekly talk show:\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/1bee2b7c8c8ae13b6d168ce7427d5de64ed06758.png)\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-410-apecoin-dao-goes-to-hollywood/22480\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

Exclusive Access: Provides token-gated offers and discounts unavailable to the general public, enhancing the value of holding ApeCoin, BAYC, Mocaverse, JRNY Club and Surreal Guild holders.\n2. Enhanced Engagement: Increases engagement and loyalty within the ApeCoin community by offering tangible rewards.\n3. Economic Advantage: As the DAO funds the app, there are no commissions deducted by FanCircles, ensuring all savings and earnings are 100% passed back to the community.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nThe total budget for the ApeCoin Rewards App is £480,000 (approximately $590,000) for two years (£288,000 for platform operation, and £192,000 for account management).\n\nThe funding term is 24 months; we may submit a follow-up AIP in the unlikely event that this project require further \nfunding. The new 24 month period for funding, extended from 12 months, in the initial proposal, allows more extensive deals to be secured, especially concerts and festivals who have year long cycles, more time to be invested in growing the awareness amongst partners and holders alike, and a strong confidence level that retail and event partners to become comfortable that the ApeCoin Rewards App is not only protecting their brand values and publicly listed prices, but also brings incremental sales. This in turn allows us to recoup any future ongoing costs after the two year term, from advertising fees we can then charge partners to continue to reach the ApeCoin and BAYC community.\n\nFunding will be due upon project passing.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-422-apecoin-rewards-app-resubmission/23396\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-426: Special Council- Future election requirement and role clarification ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThe Special Council of the APE Foundation, at the behest of the ApeCoin DAO members, acts as a liaison between the ApeCoin DAO members and the directors and officers of the APE Foundation. The Special Council exists to serve the vision of ApeCoin DAO.\n\nTo further shape the success of the role long-term, the following changes are proposed to be made:\n1. Clarify that the Special Council is an “Advisory Board’’ that serves an advisory function with no corporate decision-making power.\n    * Rationale: Oftentimes there is quoted confusion in the community about what the Special Council is or is not. In practice, the Special Council is in fact an Advisory Board neither corporate officers nor management executives, and they should not be viewed as such. The Advisory Board should also not be misconstrued as the board of directors of the APE Foundation.\n    * An effective advisory board member brings unique qualities to the table. Key qualities and characteristics that make an individual effective in this role: diverse knowledge base, proven familiarity and understanding of the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem, good judgment, thoughtfulness, communication skills, commitment, integrity, and team player abilities.\n2. Special Council nominees must have been discourse members for at least 6-months prior to the commencement of the term for which they are running and must have achieved a minimum of Trust Level 2 on discourse. For example, a nominee for the Special Council must have been a discourse member by June 30, 2024 if they are running for the January 1, 2025 term.\n    * Rationale: The primary responsibility of Special Council members is to conduct administrative review of AIPs. Accordingly, it is important for the DAO that the individuals elected to the Special Council have a strong history of participation in the discourse and with AIPs.\n3. Removal of the weekly reports established by AIP-305.\n    * Rationale: It was a good experiment, but the minimal engagement metrics of the reports has shown that they have not been an effective use of anyone’s time and efforts. Furthermore, such reports are not appropriate for advisory boards.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nImplementing the proposed changes could yield several benefits for the ApeCoin DAO and its governance structure:\n\nClarity: Renaming the Special Council to the “Advisory Board” clarifies its role and that it is distinct from corporate management and decision-making. This clarity can help ApeCoin DAO members and better understand the purpose and function of the board, leading to more focused discussions and decision-making processes.\n\nFit and Focus: Requiring nominees to have a history of discourse participation and familiarity with AIPs ensures that Advisory Board members are properly suited to their roles. This can result in more informed discussions, better decision-making, and increased trust from the community.\n\nOverall, these changes aim to optimize the Advisory Board’s role within the ApeCoin DAO, promoting long-term sustainability, and efficiency.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nNo ApeCoin requested from the treasury.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-426-special-council-future-election-requirement-and-role-clarification/23463\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*\n\n#### IMPORTANT NOTE: The BOTB DAO Snapshot is a mirrored version of the ApeCoin DAO Snapshot.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/569a48ca40c938de4078221fd25b1eff496e46e0.jpeg)\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/c/ce27b98fa57ad845ff3c26ec6433391cc0fc43b9.png)\n\nThe proposal aims to support the Community-Led IP ecosystem (CLIP), powered by ApeCoin, dedicated to empowering web3 creators, brands, and enthusiasts in the digital ownership landscape. CLIPStarter, our flagship platform, will serve as the innovation, fostering collaboration, and driving the commercialisation of NFT IP assets. Through crowdfunding for community projects, virtual exhibitions, collectibles, loyalty programs, and strategic partnerships, CLIP will pave the way for NFT IP to transcend mere collectibles and become powerful engines of commerce.\n\nCLIP will be implemented based on ApeChain. While ApeChain is the infrastructure that scales $APE and support the growth of ApeCoin ecosystem, CLIP will become the IP licensing engineer on top of ApeChain and be among the first few dAPP on ApeChain with real business operations.\n\nWe will setup a dedicated APE Team to serve ApeCoin DAO and ApeChain:\n1. Identify opportunities with new brands and partners to collaborate with ApeCoin DAO and ApeChain\n2. Promote ApeCoin to all existing ecosystem partners to raise brand awareness and integrate ApeCoin into entertainment & lifestyle sectors such as movies, video games as skin, traits, characters, F&B, etc.\n3. Proactively develop high-end collectables with existing brand partners, exclusively for ApeCoin DAO members\n4. Develop pinnacle experience with brand partners, exclusively available to ApeCoin DAO members.\n5. Connect Made-By-Ape (MBA) products with sales channels and promote brand awareness for MBA builders.\n6. To encourage ApeCoin holders to migrate their $APE to ApeChain, our loyalty system shall provide a multiplier to our participants who holds $APE on ApeChain.\n7. A CLIP ecosystem grant will be setup to provide initial funds for qualified creators if they are willing to\n    * Adopt ApeChain as the core blockchain infrastructure technology to their projects, and/or\n    * include and promote ApeCoin in their projects (subject to ApeCoin DAO final approval);\n\nAny projects receiving the CLIP ecosystem grant will have to contribute a certain percentage of their Net Revenue to the Ape Foundation \nThis will be able to attract high quality projects, as well as strong Web3 communities such as Mocaverse, Pudgy Penguin, etc., to the CLIP and APE ecosystem.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nCLIP will provide a platform for any builders to showcase and promote their IP and projects, fostering collaboration and driving innovation within the ApeCoin DAO ecosystem. By empowering creators and brands to leverage the power of NFTs, CLIP will attract new users and drive adoption of ApeCoin as a valuable digital asset. Additionally, by facilitating partnerships and collaborations, CLIP will enhance the visibility and credibility of ApeCoin DAO, positioning it as a hub for digital creativity and innovation. Since ApeCoin aims to be the leader of Web3, this platform powered by ApeCoin will help build IPs around it and make ApeCoin achieve its goals. This will also be a very powerful business applications running on ApeChain and help driving the growth of the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nApeCoin Foundation shall receive:\n* 50% of the Net Revenue generated by the APE Team\n* Branding Integration opportunities into all the CLIP’s featured projects that potentially will create millions of impressions, as a means to promote ApeCoin and ApeChain.\n* Revenue contributions from projects supported by the CLIP ecosystem grant.\n* 500 limited-edition branded collectables, licensed with Mocaverse NFT, will be distributed to ApeCoin DAO’s community members as exclusive rewards.\n* 500 limited-edition branded collectables licensed with BAYC NFT, will be distributed to ApeCoin DAO’s community members as exclusive rewards.\n* 50 conference tickets hosted by CLIP, providing ApeCoin DAO with opportunities to engage with industry leaders and stakeholders.\n* All these collectables and tickets will be distributed to the top 1,000 active ApeCoin DAO’s participants based on the CLIP’s loyalty system. Anyone holding $APE on ApeChain will receive a multiplier.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund: 2,750,000 ApeCoin\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/2/23d33a0a4439488267d01638f7249f8a709bfd65.jpeg)\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-417-ip-ecosystem-with-clip-powered-by-apecoin/22886\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-411: ArtJourney with ApeCoin: The JRNY Gallery Experience ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nWe proudly present “ArtJourney with ApeCoin: The JRNY Gallery Experience,” a groundbreaking proposal that synergizes the dynamic realms of digital art and cryptocurrency. In partnership with the JRNY Gallery, a leading force in the NFT art scene and an enthusiastic promoter of the Web3 community, this initiative is designed to enhance the visibility and utility of ApeCoin. Founded by JRNY Crypto, a distinguished crypto expert and dedicated Ape holder, JRNY Gallery is a physical NFT Gallery situated in the heart of Downtown Las Vegas’ Arts District. This proposal aims to harness JRNY Gallery’s unique position at the crossroads of digital and physical art worlds, creating a space where cutting-edge technology meets creative expression. This proposal is intended to span for one year, which will start after a month or two of setup.\n\nJRNY Gallery is not just a gallery; it’s a cultural hub, showcasing diverse digital art talents and hosting events that unite artists, enthusiasts, investors, and innovators. By integrating ApeCoin into this vibrant setting, we aspire to cultivate a deeper understanding and appreciation of ApeCoin’s potential, extending beyond the art community into the broader spectrum of digital innovation. Moreover, JRNY Gallery’s prime location within the Arts District becomes particularly significant during the monthly First Friday events, which consistently attract 15,000-20,000 visitors. These events present a unique opportunity for extensive exposure and onboarding of the general public to the world of ApeCoin and NFTs. This collaboration marks a distinctive chance to bridge communities, enhance engagement, and spotlight the transformative influence of ApeCoin in the ever-evolving narrative of digital art.\n\n[Learn more about JRNY Gallery](https://jrnygallery.com/)\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/c/cda6ff4e54eab3e7d04c0ea5103d1a00c91ec8f4.jpeg)\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe “ArtJourney with ApeCoin: The JRNY Gallery Experience” proposal is designed to deliver direct and significant benefits to the ApeCoin community, leveraging strategic branding and community engagement to enhance value. Here’s how we plan to capitalize on these opportunities:\n\n- Maximizing Brand Exposure: Our collaboration centered around the JRNY Gallery, especially during high-traffic events like First Friday, ensures that ApeCoin branding and messaging are visible to a large and diverse audience. This exposure is not just about visibility; it’s about creating a connection between ApeCoin and the innovative world of digital art. By associating ApeCoin with the creativity and excitement of the NFT art space, we enhance the brand’s perception as a leader in digital innovation.\n- Educational Outreach for Deeper Engagement: Leveraging JRNY Crypto’s expertise and platform, our educational resources about ApeCoin are designed to transform curiosity into comprehensive knowledge and active engagement. These resources, including an educational video and printed materials, will be curated with insights from JRNY Crypto, ensuring they effectively demystify ApeCoin for newcomers while enriching the understanding of existing enthusiasts. This approach transcends the mere dissemination of information, focusing instead on cultivating a knowledgeable and committed community that recognizes and values the potential of ApeCoin.\n- Community Events to Foster Loyalty: Hosting monthly events specifically for ApeCoin and Yuga holders isn’t just a means to gather the community; it’s an opportunity to strengthen the bonds within it. These events will serve as a platform for community members to connect, share ideas, and deepen their commitment to ApeCoin, creating a more cohesive and passionate user base.\n- Utilizing ApeCoin in Transactions for Real-World Utility: Accepting ApeCoin as payment for gallery events, merchandise, and artworks translates the digital currency into tangible experiences and products. This practical utility not only demonstrates the real-world applicability of ApeCoin but also encourages its circulation and adoption, enhancing its value proposition.\n- Synergy Between Digital and Physical Presence: The combination of online promotion and physical gallery presence creates a synergy that amplifies the impact of each. The physical gallery attracts visitors and media attention, while the digital presence extends the reach globally. Together, they create a comprehensive platform for ApeCoin’s promotion, driving both immediate impressions and long-term brand recognition.\n\nIn summary, the “ArtJourney with ApeCoin” proposal is crafted to harness the power of art, education, community, and real-world utility to drive not just visibility but meaningful engagement and value for the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/9287b3b8190cc9aa43050a2c9565308cb5373890.jpeg)\n\nSponsorship Details\nThe “ArtJourney with ApeCoin: The JRNY Gallery Experience” proposal includes a multifaceted package designed to showcase ApeCoin in the JRNY Gallery:\n\nGallery Support:\n- Two full walls within the JRNY Gallery will be dedicated to ApeCoin, featuring dynamic digital art and information displays. This high-visibility placement and creative showcase ensures that every visitor experiences the essence of ApeCoin’s integration with art.\n\nProjects Accepting ApeCoin & AIP-Approved Projects Section: - Our intention is to celebrate and promote projects that utilize ApeCoin, with a particular focus on showcasing projects that have been approved through the ApeCoin DAO’s AIP process. Our commitment is to foster a collaborative and respectful environment that celebrates the creativity and innovation within the ApeCoin community. Should we decide to feature any projects or works that could be associated with the “Made by Apes” concept or any other Yuga Labs program, we will ensure clear and distinct branding and signage within the gallery. This will be done to prevent any conflation between the ApeCoin DAO’s initiatives and Yuga Labs’ programs, maintaining a clear distinction in how these projects are presented and branded.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/d/d88b3f886e8a4295b0cc8072e073eb2c8713d0f5.jpeg)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-411-artjourney-with-apecoin-the-jrny-gallery-experience/22598\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n \n![Screenshot 2024-04-18 at 5.13.48 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreiaeo3efkst32ydnx3zsp3d2vxdx55urhyekwyms6c7oeo4odsy2pm)\n    \nOn February 28th, the ApeCoin DAO Governance Working Group (GWG) successfully concluded its Q4-2023/Q1-2024 budget cycle, delivering key initiatives outlined in AIP-317.\n\nHighlights include establishing an independent legal structure, website and governance dashboard development, community reward programs, election facilitation, and the completion of a 47-page treasury and economic \nsustainability study. AIP processing times were reduced to an average of 16.5 days in the final draft stage, and we came in significantly under budget which allowed us to extend what was initially planned as a 6-month budget to 7 months or more. In addition, we were able to allocate legal startup costs for both new Working Groups.\n\nStarting in Q2 2024, the Governance Working Group will roll out three new pillars of what we’re referring to as GWGV3: Education and training resources for AIP authors and leadership teams, cross-community on-chain grants programs, and a delegate accelerator initiative being developed to increase voting participation.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/e4edd7518ea6af3f5840fedc525a26663a075f23.png)\n\nFollowing extensive preparation and careful consideration, the Governance Working Group is excited to introduce a comprehensive, long-term strategy to empower the ApeCoin ecosystem by providing training and development solutions aimed at strengthening candidates going through our AIP process and, in turn, our proposal implementation success rate. This framework involves the launch of 14 education-based initiatives over the next 12 months, tailored specifically for the ApeCoin DAO. These initiatives will be developed and overseen by OpenCampus in collaboration with core members of NewCampus — a cutting-edge growth and leadership school serving some of the world’s fastest-growing organizations, boasting a client base of over 500 entities. Additionally, ForbesWeb3 will be joining us as a media and community growth partner to help put this program on the map and make ApeCoin DAO a premium destination for builders in Web3.\n\nYou can view the full APE_U program specifications [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LiSzoR3QcJ7_CSf8i7LFxHGH5kZWzEU2/view?usp=sharing)\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-18 at 5.15.47 PM.png](ipfs://bafybeie4kyjaifdwhdg6cvsp4x2mexdun4t2kl2tvwvne4brjpe2raoehq)\n    \n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/996e029e890cf9d36b3d226c8ce55edc75d689d7.png)\n\nThe Governance Working Group has also partnered with UMA to integrate their oSnap protocol for an initiative looking to explore cross-community small grant programs with the objective of extending our ecosystem into non-traditional communities. Additionally, the program will provide support for our current market, covering in-person events, NFT intellectual property propagation, professional service provider costs for ApeCoin-funded ventures, developers looking to build on ApeChain, and seed funding for early ideas.\n\n![img5](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/6d3975d64d8ab9754b194e7100ff4b80294b3f77.png)\n\nThis initiative aims to broaden ApeCoin DAO governance participation by incentivizing the formation of smaller voting delegations, matching funds of up to 50,000 APE through GWG-delegated wallets. We will also pair the initiative with the GWG x UMA On-Chain Small Grants Program and, in some cases, provide access in smaller amounts without requiring communities to match funds, allowing them to sample how our governance processes work with the objective of them joining on their own after access to our program ends. An educational program will be established to cover ApeCoin and ApeCoin DAO fundamentals, and delegated voting rights will cycle every two months to different communities. It is important to reinforce that at no point will these funds leave the GWG’s possession.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-04-18 at 5.14.39 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreig5hbqyuzrprqsrg4vjm23hx7on7x5a2cavydfcggkpvfrf7wbiyi)\n    \n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n![img7](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/7bdfed686a98d90a6cd61fab15de871f6ffe0af7.png)\n* Leveraging cross-community on-chain grants and our delegate accelerator, we will target communities that are currently not part of our ecosystem. Partnering with entities such as ForbesWeb3 and Open Campus, we dramatically expand our reach, offering exposure to our opportunities and the 14 programs being offered within the APE_U curriculum, which will also include an ApeCoinDAO onboarding series of professionally produced, co-branded four-minute videos offered in multiple languages.\n\n![img8](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/c/c4023252d28544cc0a6cfba5f4d18da6db27d942.png)\n* By simplifying the process for grants under 8500 APE and establishing precise categories, we will empower the community by streamlining opportunities that the DAO has not been set up to do up to this point.\n\n![img9](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/6/6853701ed4781222be36b0e9b10aa1e7c13ed7ec.png)\n* We will better-prepare authors for post-grant success with access to mentorships and training resources which encompass managerial essentials, futures thinking and opportunities for fast-tracked access to an Open Campus 6-week accelerator program designed to provide support and growth opportunities for education-focused startups. \n\n![img10](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/f53fdeecee61cea5256f06d703fc18dedd8d301b.png)\n* In collaboration with UMA, we are set to implement automated on-chain grant distribution for our small grants programs. This move is designed to reduce standardized administrative costs and enhance cost-effectiveness for the ApeCoin community. This methodology will also serve as an opportunity to present a proof-of-concept illustrating how allocating a portion of the DAOs treasury outside of Coinbase custody could bolster the long-term sustainability of our resources.\n\n![img11](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/97aa00c035bc877478b964d0af39162c5bcf381f.png)\n* The GWG Delegate Accelerator will match APE for APE in small tiers, up to a maximum of 50k, to encourage the onboarding and establishment of qualifying groups and new communities committed to ApeCoin governance (voting) participation. The initiative will also serve as an optional collaborative program with our cross-community on-chain grants programs.\n* Importantly, within the program, no APE will leave the possession of the Governance Working Group. Instead, it will be delegated from our Gnosis Safe as a governance token, with the goal of rotating access among various communities for limited durations. This approach aims to facilitate better assimilation, ensuring recognition as meaningful ApeCoin DAO contributors without favouring particular onboarded groups. Additionally, existing delegations meeting program requirements may also qualify as participants.\n\n![img12](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/1792be8ee1b86a3c54f3f43b1df241171e167fcb.png)\n\n![img13](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/c/cc8b696412b059fcba721d40507f139952b83ec6.png)\n* As exciting as all of our new initiatives are, it is crucial to emphasize that the Governance Working Group will also remain devoted to providing continued AIP processing, Discourse facilitation, Special Council and Working Group election facilitation, community rewards programs, stakeholder engagement, support for other Working Groups, proposal development, and various all of the other additional day-to-day ApeCoin DAO operational needs. In fact, as our scope expands through various initiatives, we’re currently aiming to scale by adding members to the team, enhancing efficiency, and once again, increasing output. Quarterly and budget-end reporting will also be maintained.\n\n![img14](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/e73c6c12f912152cc5a7115d165e3e4bce243ba5.png)\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n![img15](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/8/8a079b44032e1ee1a062d7540d50cf3d9a34c520.png)\nThe total funding request for this budget is $1,271,900.00 denominated in APE. Of these funds, $668,000.00 will be either locked and delegated to the community as governance tokens or distributed back into the ecosystem via small grants and reward programs. Any surplus will be reported and rolled into the Q4/Q1 2024/25 Governance Working Group Operations Budget. Remaining funds from AIP-317, including repaid loans provided to the Metaverse and Marketing & Communications Working Groups for costs related to establishing their legal structures, will be reported and accounted for as discretionary funding to be used for, but not limited to, general contingency, new initiative development, community rewards, community grants, business and stakeholder development, and in-person ApeCoin DAO Working Group representation.\n\nIt should also be noted that 50% of the total funding allocated for our education and training initiatives will be withheld and only accessible to the service provider as delegated governance tokens from a GWG controlled wallet until the six-month mark of the projected twelve-month duration, pending a DAO-wide vote to determine the program’s continuation.\n\n \n![Screenshot 2024-04-18 at 5.11.29 PM.png](ipfs://bafkreicyaqdniakrtixocpavpehrvvxwjcrlwdqnlgx7pc3oaqgoladgu4)\n    \n![img17](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/0/0c8c8a9237f71f222b9ed8209398182d1bbee07c.png)\n![img18](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/78e6f4610ac17f547d94144a7db7c059ac96045a.png)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-408-q2-q3-2024-governance-working-group-budget/21345",

      "title": "AIP-363: Unlocking $APE’ potential: Building a credit market with MYSO Finance ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nLiquidation Loans (ZLLs). ZLLs are a novel DeFi primitive that allow (i) borrowers to borrow without liquidation risk and (ii) lenders to lend in underdeveloped credit markets with higher yield potential.\n\nFor DAOs, ZLLs are a powerful new tool to increase the utility of their native token and to enable them to use their reserves in a more productive and strategic way.\n\nWe propose the creation of a lending market for $APE, utilizing MYSO’s v2 protocol. This initiative can offer community members access to non-liquidatable loans, thereby enhancing the utility of the $APE token. If there is confidence in the continuous growth of $APE and a desire to offer more incentives to $APE token holders, establishing a non-liquidatable lending market is an effective way to achieve this objective.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nBy using above described convertible Zero-Liquidation Loan product, it is possible to::\n* Create credit markets for the $APE token without lengthy governance processes, oracle integrations, etc.\n* Lend treasury reserves in a more strategic way that creates value for the overall community.\n* Provide a unique borrowing experience to the ApeCoin’s community, without liquidation risk.\n* Reduce selling pressure for the $APE token and incentivize long-term holding.\n* Fully customize and control the loans one underwrites.\n* Signal high conviction on the $APE token and participate in a possible synthetic buyback strategy.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nUsing MYSO, it’s possible to offer fully customizable loan options to $APE token holders by simply setting up a lending vault and specifying the loan terms desired for lending.\n\nFor example, the grant recipient (i.e. Governance Working Group [GWG], see below) could set up a vault to lend out USDC (or any other token) and accept its native $APE token as collateral. The GWG can create multiple loan offers concurrently and define at which LTVs, tenors, and interest rates they’d feel comfortable lending. Updating/deleting these loan offers is also possible in a matter of minutes.\n\nFrom a financial risk-reward perspective, the lender bears default risk that a loan may become undercollateralized and not be repaid. This resembles a deep in-the-money covered call strategy with a low delta. It’s worthwhile to mention that the risk premium is set by the GwG and can be hedged outside and independently of MYSO, if needed.\n\nMYSO’s protocol fee starts at 0.1% and scales linearly to +0.4% for a loan with a duration of 1 year. To illustrate, the protocol fee for a loan with a 90 day tenor would therefore be at 0.2% of the collateral amount. Worthwhile to highlight that MYSO’s protocol fee is currently set at 0.00%.\n\nMYSO v1 was deployed on Ethereum in January 2023. MYSO v2 was deployed on Mantle end of August 2023, on Ethereum end of September 2023 and on Arbitrum mid of October 2023. As of today, MYSO has a $1.25m TVL.\n\nOther organizations that have successfully implemented MYSO’s lending protocol include:\n* Olympus DAO ($500k pilot project for a gOHM/DAI lending market)\n* Mantle (created a lending market for $MNT), Rocketpool (we launched the first RPL/rETH credit market for their community)\n* Pendle (seeded a lending market for PT-sDAI Token), IndexCoop (to seed a lending market dsETH)\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n$750,000 USD\n\nIn order to enable meaningful borrowing capacity, MYSO would recommend seeding $750k. It’s important to note that the GWG retains full control over their lender vault, as well as the credit markets and loans they underwrite. The GWG also has the flexibility to withdraw their funds at any time, excluding the portion currently being lent out, or add more funds to their lender vault if they wish to do so.\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-363-unlocking-ape-potential-building-a-credit-market-with-myso-finance/19712\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

      "content": "![img1](https://www.altcoinbuzz.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/How-Will-Polygon-Benefit-From-Ethereum-Merge.jpeg)\n\n##### Objective:\n\nFor a 3-month trial period, swap 0.25 ETH to MATIC to establish a BOTB accelerator fund. This fund aims to support metaverse content creation and gaming initiatives in a cost-effective manner.\n\n\n##### Trial for 3 Months:\n\nRecurrent up to a max of 0.25eth for 3 months to test and have 4 of 10 Bull Council to approve case by case to use it\n\nThis fund will assist creators in developing assets for the virtual world of BOTB, including but not limited to; 3D objects, characters, mini games and content enhancing the overall experience of the BOTB metaverse. Additionally, it will offer rewards to players participating in BOTB gaming competitions such as the Nifty Mayhem tournament.\n\n![img1](https://nftplazas-com.cdn.ampproject.org/i/s/nftplazas.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NFT-Plazas-Blog-Post-template-800-x-380px-3-1536x730.jpg)\n\n##### Decision Making Process:\n\nThe Bull Council/BOTB Council, comprising 10 members, can internally decide on MATIC spending. A decision can be implemented if 4 out of 10 council members agree.The BOTB Council will conduct an emoji vote in Discord to determine if rewards should be dispensed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n##### Monetization Strategy:\n\n*Step 1*: Get the created assets, saved / stored in the designated Slack Channels and/ or Google Drive which Bull Council has access too\n\n*Step 2*: List the assets on the Nifty Island marketplace\n\n###### Nifty Island Marketplace\n![img1](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*DFyaumCSOa8OYVqyU3lvcg.png)\n\n*Step 3*: Use the community wallet or a BOTB delegated wallet if the multisig doesn't permit it\n\n*Step 4*: Determine prices by averaging out based on three comparable assets\n\n*Step 5*: Set asset listing prices in line with the market\n\n![img1](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*gg1kb4DOGcOIHL98VQRsCw.png)\n\n *Step 6*: Ensure that 100% of potential rewards (minus gas and other fees) flow back into the community wallet\n\n##### Summary: \n\nThe shift in the MATIC meta presents an opportunity for CW to diversify its portfolio and capitalize on the burgeoning gaming applications on Polygon. Integration with Ethereum further strengthens the rationale for leveraging MATIC for asset diversification, gaming initiatives, and affordable transactions, aligning with CW's strategic objectives. Additionally, the clear vision to monetize assets created using these funds ensures sustainable returns for CW.",

      "title": "AIP-414: ApeCoin DAO at NFC Lisbon ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/f/f3247dda57bba19f253098e52d69c61a9ba9a762.png)\n\nThis proposal aims to establish a dominant presence for ApeCoin and ApeCoin DAO at the Non Fungible Conference (NFC) in Portugal, scheduled for May 28-29th, along with the wrap-up event on May 30th.\n\nPlanning involves securing a 20m² furnished networking lounge situated in a premium area of the conference. This lounge will include an interactive play-zone featuring stand-up arcade games designed to capture conference-attendee interest and generate opportunities to segue into ApeChain talks. The booth will also feature a large digital monitor playing ApeCoin-focused content, and a branded wall.\n\nThe conference’s primary WiFi network accessible for guests and other sponsors will be named ApeCoin. Attendee wristbands and staff t-shirts will display ApeCoin branding, and ApeCoin will be featured on various banners and screens during [Agoria’s](https://www.instagram.com/agoria/) final set of the opening night party, held at the event venue.\n\nTwo on-stage panels are being organized each with up to four speakers and a moderator. One discussion will focus on ApeChain, prioritizing members of the Special Council, Horizen Labs, and Layer Zero, while the other will cover ApeCoin DAO Working Groups.\n\nApeCoin will be announced as co-organizers alongside The Sandbox for the May 30th boat and beach wrap-up parties. The beach event will also serve as a pre-party for the [Moga Music Festival](https://www.instagram.com/mogafestival/) expected to draw between 10-12,000 jet-setters.\n\nWe will receive forty general access event tickets, access for forty general access allowlist spots, forty special-access boat tickets, and entry for up to forty people in the special-access area of the wrap-up event. Tickets will be distributed to community members in-person, and we will incentivize new Discourse signups with small amounts of APE.\n\nThe proposal also seeks approval to use the ApeCoin logo, and Powered by ApeCoin trademarks to be used for conference and wrap-up event marketing and physical conference-related branding. Provisions for promotional items include, but are not limited to, t-shirts, stickers, and educational materials have also been made. Any inventory produced under this allowance will be exclusive to conference attendees, on-stage panelists, and booth operators [not for sale].\n\nOther conference features include a gaming startup competition with panelists Sebastien Borget (CEO Sandbox) and Robby Young (CEO Animoca Brands) helping judge, an AI Film and Fashion Festival, and a first-of-its-kind “Memecon” presented by OSF Rekt.\n\nNFC speakers include Claire Silver, Punk6529, Deekay Motion, and John Knopf.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nParticipating in the NFC Conference offers ApeCoin, ApeChain, and the DAOs Working Group a prime opportunity for increased brand awareness and media exposure with over 200 Web3 speakers expected to attend.\n\nAdditionally, the cost-effectiveness of this plan compared to other events allows us to establish ApeCoin and ApeCoin DAO as one of the two dominant brand’s at the conference, alongside The Sandbox. Furthermore, Lisbon is known for its affordability in Western Europe, which helps business operations and travel.\n\nSecuring a 20m² area in a premium location with games and seating will enhance ApeCoin’s credibility, providing real-world exposure as a leading brand in the space. The conference also offers valuable networking and onboarding opportunities for ApeChain, serving as a platform for education regarding opportunities provided by the DAO.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/7eb5eacf4602d2df65ab2f2685f8dc52bc8b0a89.png)\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nThe proposal is requesting $155,000.00 USD denominated in APE with the full amount of funding required for conference and wrap-up sponsorship being provided in APE to the event.\n\nIf platinum-level sponsorships are unavailable when funding is provided, we will secure a gold-level booth in its place. Any difference in funding will either be not accepted or returned to the APE Foundation.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/5791a33a1ebb2980c17cac7e297dd1a7ae444bbc.png)\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/7edb340a98eeca2dff0c3ec579bc442ba47269ab.png)\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-414-apecoin-dao-at-nfc-lisbon/22808\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThe ApeCoin Rewards App will be available on iOS, Android, and as a web app and is designed to reward ApeCoin and BAYC holders with a range of rewards and benefits, while also providing visibility to MADE BY APES licensees. Holders who have at least one ApeCoin or a BAYC/MAYC are eligible for exclusive rewards. The app offers the ability to access POAP NFT drops, multimedia promotional content from partners, industry event promotional opportunities, as well as discounts and special offers in collaboration with Made By Apes licensees and at participating retailers across the US and Europe, both online and in real life (IRL). This emphasis on rewards and benefits aims to deliver continuous value and enhance engagement within the ApeCoin community and grow the awareness outside of Web3.\n\nThere’s no cost for users to use any feature of the app. The app is free to use and has the ability to gate content and rooms (Discord call them channels) via integration with WalletConnect.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe ApeCoin Rewards App directly supports the ApeCoin ecosystem by enhancing token utility and engagement among holders. By offering exclusive rewards, discounts, and promotional content, the app incentivizes the holding and use of ApeCoin, potentially increasing demand and value. It aligns with the APE Community’s core mission of fostering a vibrant community of creators and innovators in the web3 space by providing a platform that rewards creativity, participation, and loyalty. Furthermore, by integrating with MADE BY APES licensees, the app promotes visibility and collaboration within the ecosystem, embodying the values of boldness, equality, transparency, collective responsibility, and persistence. The next stage would be to talk more formally to each of these licensees regarding their potential participation in the program.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nThe total budget for the ApeCoin Rewards App is £240,000 (approximately $288,000) for the first year (£144,000 for platform operation, and £96,000 for account management).\n\nThe funding term is 12 months; the author may submit a follow-up AIP should the project require further funding. This includes development, maintenance, partner onboarding, and marketing efforts. Costs will be paid quarterly, with the first payment due upon project initiation.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-398-apecoin-rewards-app/21565\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-405: [Resubmission] ApeSwap on ApeChain ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThe ApeCoin DAO is built on the fundamental goal of enabling Yugaverse and ApeCoin holders with value. To date, the focus has been enabling marketplaces, a native blockchain, communications, IRL events/education, physical assets, and more.\n\nWith the launch of ApeChain fast approaching in June, a native swap/DEX product is needed in order to enable adoption and competitive functionality on ApeChain. ApeCoin DAO has the ability to establish a first-mover advantage by backing ApeSwap, a native ApeChain DEX powered by [Solidity.io](https://solidity.io/) and Sushi Labs (Sushi Swap).\n\nOur vision is to launch ApeSwap as a (DEX) to benefit ApeCoin holders. The ApeCoin DAO DEX will enable the decentralized exchange of tokens supported by multi-asset pools that earn liquidity providers fees from market making and swap fees. It should be noted that ApeSwap would not necessarily be the exclusive DEX of the ApeChain ecosystem.\n\nApeSwap will include a protocol fee for token swaps, with 50% of all protocol fees returning back to the ApeCoin DAO treasury. Immediately upon the launch and accrual of fees the DAO treasury would receive revenue distributions in accordance with the payout schedule established by Sushi Labs. In addition, ApeSwap will undergo a token generation event, and will provide an airdrop of ApeSwap DEX native tokens to ApeCoin token holders, as well as an airdrop directly to the ApeCoin treasury.\n\nSushi Labs, with development support from [Solidity.io](https://solidity.io/), will support strategic and technical efforts with the deployment, ownership, and maintenance of the DEX. In addition to this, ApeSwap will offer a token airdrop to active Sushi Swap ecosystem users to incentivize the growth and adoption of ApeChain by the broader DeFi community. xSushi (Staked sushi) holders will likely be the targets for the airdrop.\n\nSpecifications | [Solidity.io](https://solidity.io/)will operate as the core service provider for the ApeSwap DEX launch. This includes conducting design, development, and deployment of a native decentralized exchange on ApeChain for ApeSwap on behalf of Sushi Labs. All data points from the DEX will be aggregated to a decentralized datastore to enable real-time charting on the platform. The $APE grant will be paid to [Solidity.io](https://solidity.io/)upon passing of this proposal to fund ecosystem development and maintenance for one year. [Solidity.io](https://solidity.io/) will be the pre-selected core service provider, responsible for delivering on the product roadmap, supporting tokenomics design, go-live support, and maintenance of the product and platform for one year. With Sushi Labs being the operating entity and administrator of the franchised DEX, they would be responsible for hosting and maintenance coordination after one year if [Solidity.io](https://solidity.io/)and Sushi decide not to renew the initial 1-year agreement together. We expect maintenance costs after year one to fall under $100k per year for maintenance and hosting.\n\nApeSwap will launch a token on ApeChain to function as the core utility token for ApeSwap. $APE holders will receive an airdrop, ApeCoin DAO treasury will receive an airdrop, and ApeCoin DAO treasury will receive a portion of trading fees.\n\nSushi Labs will function as the legal and managing entity overseeing the DEX launch and TGE, and ApeSwap will fall under the Sushi Labs management company as part of their franchised DEX model. Sushi will provide marketing support around the DEX launch and will handle all non-technical infrastructure, including domain maintenance and ownership, and hosting and serving of the platform.\n\nUsers can swap in and out of tokens utilizing the platform’s liquidity to perform transactions. The swap will display relevant information including price impact, slippage, and deadline. In addition to swap, users will be able to add liquidity to pairs, this process will be a separate flow allowing users to customize their transaction. We plan to incentivize liquidity provision from the community and strategic partners.\n\nAt this time, final decisions have not yet been made regarding use of any existing ApeCoin DAO trademarks, or the creation of new trademarks related to ApeSwap, but the team does want to opt for an ‘Ape’ themed branding style.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nApeCoin DAO needs revenue!\n\nThe implementation of ApeSwap will be a key step in creating sustainable, on-chain infrastructure that is cash-flow generative and exists as a fundamentally ApeCoin-backed asset.\n\nBy receiving a portion of the protocol fees, as well as an airdrop to the treasury and ApeCoin holders. The ApeSwap DEX represents a potential long-term revenue stream to the DAO.\n\nWith the ApeCoin community containing many Web3 users and investors, the utility of a natively owned and backed DEX will generate massive value for existing holders, and incentivize new ApeCoin holders to acquire $APE.\nThe core of this proposal is centered around our motivation to build sustainable ApeCoin DAO treasury revenue and broader adoption of the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nThe goal of the ApeSwap is to create a self-sustaining, cash-flow generative addition of infrastructure to the ApeCoin ecosystem, while capturing value that a competitor on ApeChain will otherwise take.\n\nIn addition, a token drop will reward $APE holders who have long deserved some value being returned to them through the DAO.\n\nAt this time, all that can be shared is that the plan is to have airdrop/token allocations to the following parties: ApeCoin holders, ApeCoin DAO treasury, Sushi Treasury, xSushi holders, team, Rewards for liquidity provision. This is a fluid process of course and will be more solidified over time. Users will need to connect to a site/platform to claim.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTotal Budget: 750,000 APE COIN\n\nDetailed Cost Breakdown and Allocations\n\nPlatform Design & Development: $340K\n* DEX UX/UI Design: $30,000\n* Tokenomics & Technical Architecture: $65,000\n* Smart Contract Development & Testing: $60,000\n* Front-end Development & Integration: $65,000\n* Back-End Development for Farming Rewards and Charting/Analytics: $45,000\n* Trading Alerts Features: $25,000\n* Smart Contract Audits (Internal & 3rd Party): $50,000\n\nMarketing, Business Development, and Operations: $120K\n* Business Development & Partnerships: $45,000\n* Marketing & Community Engagement: $50,000\n* Operations & Miscellaneous: $25,000\n\nLegal & Compliance: $100K\n* Comprehensive legal support and compliance assurance to navigate the regulatory landscape effectively.\n\nInfrastructure & Miscellaneous Costs: $190K\n* Hosting Costs: $35,000\n* Blockchain Indexing/Data Storage: $25,000\n* Contingency Fund: $50,000\n* 1-Year Maintenance: $80,000 (Included to ensure ongoing support and updates for the platform, covering server maintenance, product updates, and bug fixes.)\n\nWhile a plan to submit a follow-up AIP in collaboration with Sushiswap to continue as ApeSwap’s service provider after the conclusion of the initial 1-year term has not yet been decided, we hope revenue from the DEX will be sufficient to maintain all operations and maintenance expenses post the initial 1-year term.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-405-resubmission-apeswap-on-apechain/22330\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-400: Enable $APE as a payment option for onchain consumer transactions on Co:Create Ink ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis AIP seeks to create an extension of [Co:Create Ink](https://www.cocreate.ink/), enabling redeemable and digital-only tattoo designs to be powered by and purchased with $APE, with the primary objective of establishing a sustainable business model that:\n* Establishes a new use case for $APE\n* Creates real-world consumer transactions using $APE\n\nWHY TATTOOS?\nThe history of tattoos goes back thousands of years. Yet, in modern times, tattoos were taboo in much of the Western world. They were an art form associated with sailors, soldiers, and criminals, something you hid if you wanted a “white-collar job.” In fact, tattoos were made illegal in many US states and cities for decades, with tattoo bans not repealed in New York City until 1997.\n\nThings have changed drastically in the last two decades. 1 in 3 Americans now have a tattoo. When we look at younger demographics, that percentage increases dramatically - more than 50% of women aged 18-49 have tattoos. Perceptions have also changed, with 80% of Americans stating they believe society has become more accepting of tattoos in recent years.\n\nThe tattoo industry has grown alongside this shift in perception. By some estimates, the US tattoo industry alone exceeds $1.5B USD and is projected to reach $3.9B by 2030. For all the growth and cultural relevance of tattoos, the business of tattooing has yet to evolve.\n\nThe industry needs to be more cohesive, composed mostly of small, independently owned businesses. There are no dominant software platforms or point-of-sale systems. As a result, tattoo shops have remained primarily cash-only businesses.\n\nSecond, the price artists charge for their art is based on how long it takes them to apply a tattoo, not based on the art they create, contrary to how prices are set for most other art forms. Tattoo artists are still paid like hourly workers.\nWith the rise of social media and the creator economy, we have seen the emergence of tattoo artist celebrities. These top tattoo artists have massive social media followings, with some garnering millions of online followers. Not surprisingly, appointment wait times can extend multiple years for what are rightly considered masterpieces.\n\n![Img](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/0/0d030a94f279435a272e68c98df696c69ded854c.jpeg)\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nWe imagine a future where ApeCoin powers a sizable percentage of global consumer crypto payments. Co:Create Ink will introduce ApeCoin to new users, positioning $APE as THE method for onchain consumer transactions. ApeCoin DAO will leverage Co:Create Ink as a platform to accelerate adoption, inspiring more real-world applications and mainstream adoption of $APE as a payment gateway.\n\n2.5% of top-line revenue from all transactions paid for with $APE will be sent to the ApeCoin DAO treasury until the full allocation of this AIP is returned. Distribution of revenue back to the DAO treasury will occur on a bi-annual basis until $50k USD or the equivalent of ApeCoin is returned to the DAO.\n\n10% of revenue generated through $APE transactions will be held for three months in $APE by Co:Create Ink.\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nTotal amount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = $50,000 to be paid in $APE to create a payment gateway on Co:Create Ink to support purchases in $APE.\n\nBelow are areas in which we will use the $50k to enable a payment gateway to accept APE for purchases:\n* Legal review to ensure no issues are accepting APE to buy tattoos domestically and internationally\n* Identifying and integrating with a crypto payments provider/platform\n* Design and product management to create a product requirements doc and Figma designs\n* Engineering resources to build and test APE payment rails in the product\n* Operationalize accepting payments in APE and paying artists on a set cadence\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-400-enable-ape-as-a-payment-option-for-onchain-consumer-transactions-on-co-create-ink/21679\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-409: Voter Discovery and Coalitions in ApeCoin DAO ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal aims to leverage DAO aggregation data and analysis to identify and address barriers to voting in ApeCoin DAO, enabling the development of tailored onboarding incentives, and programs to strengthen quality participation. By gaining insights into the interests and activity patterns of $APE token holders, the DAO can optimize its governance processes and foster a more engaged and focused community.\n\nAn extended coverage of the DAO’s internal power groups is also offered as part of this report. With ApeCoin DAO’s over 9k lifetime voters, and delegates, it is important to look at the groups of voters that lead the DAO in terms of decision making. DeepDAO’s Power Coalitions report enables transparency of these groups and their voting power, and serves to protect the DAO from possible governance attacks.\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nBy leveraging DeepDAO’s aggregated data, ApeCoin DAO can identify the most promising initiatives to focus on, and attract the right people to contribute their skills and expertise.\n\nBy using the Power Coalitions data, the DAO can identify its own power groups, and make them available to all stakeholders and the community. A coalition in our terminology is defined as a group of people who frequently vote together on the same proposals and in the same direction (e.g. Yes, or No). This could be groups of two, three, ten, or more people.\n\nRational\nYour DAO voters have diverse motivations and goals. Their involvement can be for short lived gains, or long term impact. Your voters are also in high demand, with dozens of DAOs competing for their attention.\n\nDeepDAO’s Voter Discovery generates a large set of insights about your delegates, voters, and token holders:\n* Voter interests across all DAO categories. Understand the full voting profile of your voters, delegates, and token holders.\n* Discover voting patterns: yearly voting, top voters, voters who stopped voting, and loyal voters, who should be awarded and celebrated. DeepDAO provides full CSV lists of all addresses identified here.\n* Competitors analysis: which DAOs compete with yours on the attention of your voters and token holders? We map your competitors based on your voters and token holders voting in other DAOs.\n* Missing voters: $APE token holders, who vote in other DAOs, but do not vote in ApeCoin DAO. We provide a comprehensive list of these voters and, by request, segment them across competing DAOs.\n* Voter coalitions: Identify your internal power groups, and protect your DAO against governance grabs. This information may also improve communication between the separate interest groups.\n* For each power coalition we provide several data points:\n    * The coalition’s combined voting power, measuring its strength in the DAO.\n    * The number of times the coalition voted together, measuring how frequently this power is used.\n    * The first time they voted together, and date of the most recent vote, indicating when the coalition started working together, and their recent involvement.\n\nThere are several distinct benefits to this granular understanding of the DAO participating stakeholders:\n\nMarketing optimization: Attract new voters, and token holders, and retain existing ones by aligning outreach with their specific interests.\n\nTailored onboarding steps and incentives, optimizing engagement and overall governance activity.\n\nIncreased quality participation: Drive higher turnout and more informed decision-making.\n\nGovernance resilience: Reward and cultivate the various groups of loyal, and prominent voters within the DAO, according to their interests, engagement and level of expertise. This will strengthen the DAO’s long-term health and resistance to governance attacks.\n\nAn example for the usage of this data: let’s consider a scenario where out of the 145k+ $APE holders, we identify over 20k individuals highly interested in DeFi, as well as gaming, and identity solutions. With this information, ApeCoin DAO can create a campaign to advance the ApeCoin community’s mission for this specific target market.\n\nAnother example: We identify that there are several meaningful voter and delegate coalitions within the DAO. With this information in hand, the DAO can facilitate discussion between the groups and navigate towards common, agreed on goals.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nWe request total funding of $25,000 with the following breakdown: 33% once the proposal is accepted, and the remaining 67% upon the report finalization.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-409-voter-discovery-and-coalitions-in-apecoin-dao/21966\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimise for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.*",

      "title": "AIP-393: Proposal to stake 2.5 Million $APE into the Cyan ApeCoin Vault ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis proposal aims to have 2.5 million $APE staked directly into the Cyan ApeCoin Vault from the ApeCoin DAO.\n\nCyan is a DeFi protocol enabling users to Buy Now Pay Later, Borrow, Lend, Stake, and truly retain their ownership through the power of our wallet, allowing users to take advantage of Wallet Connect.\n\nThe $APE provided by this grant will be staked to the Cyan ApeCoin Staking vault until the emissions expire, upon which all funds will be retained by the DAO. This $APE can safely be used to increase membership, spread awareness, and expand the ecosystem by putting $APE directly into the hands of more BAYC and MAYC users who have little to no $APE and no exposure to the DAO. We’ve battle-tested and have proven the vault increases participation in the ApeCoin DAO.\n\nOur current users have created AIPs, voted on AIPs, and dived deeper into the ecosystem by developing stronger relationships and exploring deeper parts of the community. With Cyan, we can incentivize users to participate at no cost to them, while generating profits for the ApeCoin DAO. Cyan will pass through 100% of the yields from the 2.5 million $APE to the DAO. Cyan will also share 50% of the revenue generated by staking activities with the DAO. At the end of the ApeCoin staking emissions schedule, the 2.5 million $APE will be returned to the DAO.\n\nHow is Cyan able to do this through our protocol? Explainer here:\n\nThe Cyan ApeCoin Vault provides multiple ways to earn yield. Staked $APE is always earning yield as the following logic is applied:\n* $APE is paired to BAYC/MAYC/BAKC owners who want to stake but don’t have $APE. The generated yield is shared between both parties.\n* $APE which isn’t utilized for the above activity are directly staked into Horizen Labs staking contracts\n* Staking positions are continuously compounded on a bi-weekly basis. Gas is paid by Cyan\n\nThrough these activities, staked $APE is always earning yield to its maximum potential. For a deeper dive into the mechanics, please visit our documentation here: [https://docs.usecyan.com/docs/staking-apecoin](https://docs.usecyan.com/docs/staking-apecoin)\n\nThe original AIP idea thread can be found here: [https://forum.apecoin.com/t/proposal-to-stake-5-million-ape-into-the-cyan-apecoin-vault/20921](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/proposal-to-stake-5-million-ape-into-the-cyan-apecoin-vault/20921)\n\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n1. ApeCoin DAO generates more $APE for their treasury and other initiatives.\n2. Delegated people/groups can increase their voting power through users accessing $APE.\n3. BAYC/MAYC users can access $APE for free and get voting power equal to their max stake allotment such as 10,094 for BAYC and 2,042 for MAYC, effectively onboarding more users.\n4. The staked $APE CANNOT be liquidated by users, ensuring the full amount of 2.5 million is protected at all times.\n5. The 2.5 million $APE grant will be returned at the end of the staking period. This effectively costs the ApeCoin DAO 0 $APE.\n6. The ApeCoin DAO generates 50% of the revenue from $APE-related transactions processed through Cyan.\n\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nAmount requested from the ApeCoin Ecosystem Fund = 2,500,000 ApeCoin + $13,504\n\nThe cost comes from a 0.30% deposit fee, which is universal across all Cyan vaults. At current APEUSD prices of $1.80, this would be approximately $13,500. An estimated $4 gas fee is added.\n\nMoreover, an investment of 2.5 million $APE (valued at USD 4.5 million as of March 19, 2024) into the Cyan ApeCoin Vault is necessary, though not an expense. The DAO would maintain control of these funds. Any increase in value and interest earned throughout the investment period would be kept by the DAO.\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/0/0e950f44403b1d358845879cfb6e65b90e1a78c8.png)\n\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-393-proposal-to-stake-2-5-million-ape-into-the-cyan-apecoin-vault/20921\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nThis budget request is to finance the first 6 months of operations of the Metaverse Working Group (MWG).\n\nThe operational guidelines for this Working Group are outlined in [AIP-245](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-245-working-group-charter-metaverse/11840). The proposal provides a comprehensive framework of Objectives and Key Results (OKR) aimed at ensuring ongoing growth and accountability and keeping the community informed about progresses. The Metaverse Working Group consists of a two-person team: David, based in Hong-Kong and Dim, based in France.\n\nThis budget allows the MWG to pursue their mission while keeping the flexibility to adapt to potential opportunities.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\n1. A strong foundation: Establishing the transparent and compliant legal structure for the Metaverse Working Group to facilitate a smooth and sustainable transition for subsequent Stewards.\n2. Empower creators: With the creation of the ApeCoin Creators Assembly the MWG aim at stimulating cooperation within the existing community and expand it further.\n3. Develop ApeCoin presence in the Metaverse: Onboarding new community members through experience and partnerships creating a broader ecosystem.\n4. Support Otherside development: Laying the groundwork to become a lead resource for ODK integrations and support content creators and builders in the Otherside. Developing a strategy for the purchase and usage of DAO owned Metaverse assets to benefit the community [See AIP draft](https://forum.apecoin.com/t/apecoin-dao-s-otherside-strategy-acquisition-of-assets-and-usage/21407).\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nThis budget proposal requests an allocation of $APE tokens equivalent to $415,500 USD to cover the Metaverse Working Group’s first six-month operational needs.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/c/c4a05badaf5d653a6cc4cbb53040440ec48d29dc.jpeg)\n\nThe Metaverse WG LLC will be the recipient of the grant, and the funds will be received in the multi-sig wallet with both MWG stewards as signers. In the event that any of these budget line items extend beyond June, the third elected MWG Steward would be added as a signer to the multisig wallet.\n\nThe Metaverse Working Group shall invoice the Foundation against this budget as needed but still reserves the right to take custody in full, as approved through this AIP.\n\n##### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-404-apecoin-dao-metaverse-working-group-budget/22062\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

      "title": "AIP-395: .APE - Launching the Real .APE Top-Level Domain on the Internet ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/4/45a2cf6707ea59374f5f7eddbf6e7e453bfc5bcd.png)\n\nICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), the world’s authority on IP addresses and domain names, has permissioned the second-ever instance in the history of the Internet to apply for new top-level domains (TLDs). The imminent reopening for a limited duration and potential cap on applications adds a layer of scarcity and urgency to this opportunity.\n\nThis is a proposal to create the .APE top-level domain (TLD) as a real-world asset (RWA) during the upcoming ICANN application round, which we anticipate will open as soon as 2025. The application takes approximately one (1) year to prepare and is led by D3, a next-generation identity company focused on bridging the gap between traditional Internet infrastructure and Web3.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/4/4bafa963b31766b184f9eaf42ca7653d9f5ab2fb.png)\n\nThe .APE TLD has the potential to create a lucrative, perpetual source of revenue for ApeCoin DAO, enabling growth of the community through new .APE domains, and cement ApeCoin (and $APE) as a major real-world asset with interoperability and utility at its core. D3 plans to offer a patent-pending tokenized *APE (e.g. SAM *APE) as an immediate Web3 identifier for users, while in parallel submitting the ICANN application for the real .APE TLD to enable future interoperability and native resolution seamlessly across Web2 and Web3. ApeCoin DAO will receive 50% of all gross revenues generated from the *APE name tokens and the .APE Top-Level Domain\n\nIt is not possible for any entity or individual to “own” a TLD. ICANN contractually grants the rights to exclusively operate and monetize each TLD that automatically renews every 10 years. This is true of every ICANN-accredited gTLD, including .com and .xyz. In order for the ApeCoin DAO to take advantage of the benefits the D3 team offers as an existing ICANN-accredited registry operator (e.g. expedited application and minimal diligence on the DAO and the Foundation), D3 must be the TLD applicant and contracted registry operator with ICANN. This also means that D3 will take on the onerous ongoing registry obligations (e.g. annual audits, compliance, etc) to ensure .APE remains in good standing. D3 acts as essentially the white-glove and full-service operator for .APE. ApeCoin DAO and the Foundation will maintain a vested interest and voice in all TLD operations, including pricing strategy, launch timeline, whitelists and blacklists, and more. Should the Foundation desire to create its own entity and maintain the complex ongoing registry obligations, D3 will be happy to facilitate the transfer for the .APE TLD once approved.\n\nThere will be no exclusivity beyond the .APE TLD: the ApeCoin DAO has the freedom to work with other grant recipients for other TLDs, although this is practically unlikely as there are economies at scale associated with hosting multiple TLDs with D3.\n\nIt should be noted however that, in considering the best interests of the Apecoin DAO and its members, it is our firm belief that D3 should hold exclusive rights to the .APE domain name extension, just like the real .COM or .XYZ domain name extension. Given the upcoming opportunities and challenges with the ICANN round, ensuring that D3 maintains exclusivity over the .APE domain extension is not just a strategic move—it is a necessary step to protect and nurture the Apecoin DAO’s growth.\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nD3 and its affiliates will leverage its deep industry experience and accreditation to apply for and launch the .APE TLD, on behalf of the ApeCoin DAO, in the upcoming ICANN application round for new top-level domains. The .APE top-level domain will provide perpetual branding, utility, and revenue generating potential for the ApeCoin community while expanding ecosystem adoption through D3’s innovative registry and registrar, focused on top Web3 communities.\n\nName Tokens – Accelerating Launch and Go-To-Market\n\nName tokens are D3’s patent-pending methodology to distribute and scale the APE community well in advance of the establishment of .APE as a real TLD by ICANN. They offer a wide range of Web3 utility, including being used as memorable multi-chain wallet addresses, cross-platform Web3 usernames, decentralized infrastructure identifiers and more.\n\nD3 name tokens also act as expressions of interest for our domains, and token holders will have early access to the TLDs we launch in the future (such as .APE). *APE name tokens, or Ape Names, will be displayed on D3’s marketplace alongside other community name tokens partnered with D3 to pursue a TLD application. Just like purchasing a domain name, users will pay annual fees to own an Ape Name, creating an important evergreen revenue source for the DAO.\nImportantly, unlike other web3 name services, name tokens are designed to accommodate D3’s application for the .APE TLD in accelerating revenue generation for the ApeCoin community while creating future utility. D3 is committed to providing the ApeCoin DAO a real-world asset in the .APE TLD.\n\n![img3](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/9/94fedcf066678ee3a4ca50cf54f0aa4dba5578e8.png)\n\nBringing Real-World Utility To ApeCoin\n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) is critical Internet infrastructure that has been instrumental in the adoption, growth and accessibility of the Internet. The .APE TLD will unlock a multitude of real-world applications, combined with existing Web3 utility.\n\n![img4](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/7c3f2d5a66ca8a64769d14da1cd6068b13c313f8.png)\n\nThese interoperable identities will leverage D3’s extensive DNS distribution network, while allowing a user’s .APE domain to serve as a website and email address, as well as multi-chain wallet address, cross-platform user name, serve verifiable credentials and more. The DNS is a secure, well established source of truth that will combat the growing number of unapproved, Web3-specific .APE names that have sprouted recently attempting to cash in on the ‘Ape’ brand in bad faith.\n\n![img5](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/c/c064f5b1cdf547c5e437093f3fbf5605675c8d2c.png)\n\nThis comprehensive approach leverages our domain expertise to not only advance ApeCoin’s recognition within the blockchain community, but also to position it as a versatile and widely adopted asset with relevance in both Web3 and real-world scenarios.\n\nApeCoin Community Growth & Brand Expansion\n\nUpon approval of our proposal, D3 intends to provide each Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFT holder with a relevant *APE name token (eg. MACHI * APE, 7065 * APE) as an immediate Web3 identity solution for users until the real .APE TLD is launched. Currently, Apes use numbers to identify themselves, but with Ape Names, they will have dedicated digital identities that add even more value to their existing personas.\n\n![img6](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/540cbc7373b6a1df10755c459ca865705caae15d.png)\n\nIn addition, members of the ApeCoin community will have the exclusive opportunity to gain early access to other *APE name tokens before they are made available to the public. Following this Right of First Refusal period, *APE name tokens will be offered to the public. These *APE name tokens will serve as representations of the ApeCoin brand and community within D3’s marketplace and across the globe.\n\n![img7](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/1/176ecf106acb836d9cf7c998b1b491baec3e2a10.jpeg)\n\nOnce we have acquired and launched the .APE TLD, real .APE domains will not only work with Web3, but they will also natively resolve on the Domain Name System (DNS) for mainstream functionality like websites and email. .APE will establish a lasting brand presence on the internet and create unique, universally recognized native identities across Web2 and Web3, which can take advantage of the inherent benefits of each. D3’s approach opens the floodgates to a non-Web3 audience, expanding ApeCoin’s reach and fostering adoption among a broader demographic, thus contributing to the long-term value accrual for ApeCoin.\n\nLong-Term Recurring Revenue Generation\n\nSimilar to .COM and .XYZ, .APE has the potential to create a new source of fast-growing recurring revenue while providing a unique, liquid, and tradeable RWA.\n\nWith the expertise from D3’s veteran team, the .APE TLD could become the next REAL, big domain extension, with the potential to drive thousands of monthly domain transactions that can generate millions in annual recurring revenue.\n\nIllustrative Revenue Projection\n\n![img9](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/e/e97b31238720d0730189a86cdd02d8f163936410.png)\n\n##### OVERALL COST \n3 million ApeCoin\n\n![img10](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/a/afdc7d90139d410fae1983a5cdfbf8c6db6a8976.jpeg)\n\nAll proceeds will be used directly to apply for, market, and launch the .APE domain extension:\n* ApeCoin DAO will receive 50% of all gross revenues generated from the *APE name tokens and the .APE Top-Level Domain\n* Compared to .COM (160M domains) and .XYZ (13M), the .APE TLD could create a $M+ evergreen, profitable real-world asset for the ApeCoin DAO at a fraction of scale needed (proj. $5M+ annual recurring revenue within 36 months of launch)\n* D3 and ApeCoin DAO could represent .APE for a lifetime (10-year TLD rights, with auto-renewals)\n\nD3 will incur on-going technical and operational costs related to managing the .APE namespace, with contribution from ApeCoin DAO for co-marketing into the masses.The below includes the initial budget for the .APE acquisition process (APE):\n\n![img11](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/4/4f1b3599403368909e26b091e7cf6aaff1506894.png)\n\n##### PROPOSAL",

      "title": "AIP-402: $APE as a Fuel for Mobile Growth to Help Make Dookey Dash a #1 Hit Game ",
      "content": "##### ABSTRACT\nImagine $APE as fuel for growth to generate more demand for $APE. Presented by a team with a proven track record of launching dozens of chart-topping games like 2048 and Two Dots, this proposal seeks to help propel the Apecoin DAO as a marketing tool to not only encourage more games to implement $APE in their ecosystem, but to also market the games directly to the masses. For its first iteration, this proposal is set to help propel “Dookey Dash” to a #1 hit mobile game. By achieving this milestone, we aspire to amplify global awareness of $APE, and create a precedent for how $APE, through targeted ad spend across major ad networks, can fuel new demand for $APE in an ROI positive manner.\n\nWe are $APE holders and we want to see new demand for $APE. It is in the DAO’s benefit for there to be a #1 hit mobile game that is utilizing $APE to be exposed to a wider audience of gamers, and burst outside of our current bubble. The more new players exposed to games involving $APE, the more new demand there will be for $APE. This will hopefully serve as a great use case to not only provide DAO marketing support for games utilizing $APE in their ecosystem, but also act another way to encourage games to implement $APE into their game.\n\nSuperfine, a Made By Apes Company, is an AI growth tool for games to maximize their UA. It allows the capability to spend $APE across all ad networks simultaneously, focusing on maximizing your goals, be it maximum installs, lower CPA, or ROAS (return on ad spend). The game is able to determine which player qualifications it wants to target (by country, age, etc) and will only hit the bid if it fits into the desired goal. This AIP is also represented by Faraway, the studio behind Dookey Dash, which has also produced another game, Serum City, that implements $APE and supports the ecosystem.\n\n![img1](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/5/5ed91d384c482a687719c45a6777aa98e6bd5ed0.png)\n\n##### BENEFIT TO APECOIN ECOSYSTEM\nThe proposal aligns with the $APE Community’s mission, specifically with its boldness and transparency. We want to reach traditional gamers, and with Dookey Dash: Unclogged being released, we feel like we can provide the DAO with a great opportunity for $APE to reach a more broad audience. With $APE at the center of the economy for the game, and the game being incredibly popular from the first time around, we feel like this could do wonders for the exposure of the DAO. The more people that download Dookey Dash, the more people that are exposed to $APE. Not only does this proposal serve an immediate impact, but it also sets the stage to serve as a marketing platform as additional mobile games come to the DAO seeking performance marketing support.\n\n![img2](https://global.discourse-cdn.com/apecoin/original/2X/7/71c786f2569c606c784c3273672f852db2104181.png)\n\n##### OVERALL COST \nWe are seeking $150,000 in $APE from the DAO, essentially serving as a grant from the DAO to support the growth of Dookey Dash, the first potential mainstream mobile game that implements $APE. Every dollar will be used to market Dookey Dash and discover which creatives, bidding strategies, and targeting parameters work to scale most effectively, with full transparency provided to the DAO. These tests are incredibly important to the success of a mobile launch, and the DAO would be able to play a key role in supporting these efforts.\n\n#### PROPOSAL\n\nLink to the full proposal: https://forum.apecoin.com/t/aip-402-ape-as-a-fuel-for-mobile-growth-to-help-make-dookey-dash-a-1-hit-game/22072\n\n*The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation.

For the collection, I currently hold over 100 BOTB's (and plan on continuing to grow that number). \nI entered Web3 late in 2021. Throughout 2022, I experienced the rollercoaster that rocked the Crypto/NFT market with some really great projects/communities and a healthy dose of toxic leadership projects and of course a fair share of rugpulls. I cannot tell you how happy I am to have found this project and BAP. My 1st alpha group is Lobster Beach Club and have a lot of good friends in there where we always watch/support each others back. That is what I plan to do here, trying to help everyone as much as possible. \nIRL, I have built, ran and sold a web design agency (WordPress, Magento, etc) and helped another digital marketing agency grow from 4 people to almost 60 people before exiting right as Covid began and turning my attention to my current world which is technology consulting/staffing. Today, I help to manage/run a team of 26 people and love what I do everyday. Outside of work, I also have 3 kids, coach all of their sports, play in 1-2 ice hockey leagues at any given moment and I'm excited to build for my families future.\n\nZ'Devil\nPassionate Content Creator: My dedication for creating comics and IP-based content for the brand fuels my commitment.\nDiverse Content Portfolio: With over 50+ BOTBs, I bring a diverse array of content for various uses.\nActive Social Media Presence: Engaging actively on social platforms to ensure our content reaches a wider audience.\nCommunity Involvement: Actively participating in multiple IP-focused communities, fostering collaboration and fresh ideas.\nCommunity Building and Management: Having previously served as the head moderator at Toy Mories, I contributed significantly by guiding the team through suggesting ideas and strategies, in close collaboration with the project owner. Simultaneously, leveraging my background as an F&B manager, I actively participated in building and managing the community, contributing to the overall success of the project.\nIn-House Comic Production: Currently, I'm crafting the comics for Bulls on the Block. We follow a script-first approach, ensuring quality storytelling before visual creation.\nI am confident that, in addition to my current day job, I can seamlessly contribute to sustaining and elevating the quality and value of IP content for Bulls on the Block.\n\nWiseCloud\nI am WiseCloud and I am excited to officially submit my candidacy for the Bull Council membership. My passion for brand building has led me to accumulate several different BOTBs along the way.\nI bring a wealth of experience in managing multiple successful Twitter accounts within the web3 space, coupled with proficiency in Slack  My expertise lies in strategically organizing tweets to ensure clear and effective communication. \nOver the past 12 months, I have been deeply involved in the BAP ecosystem, serving as a moderator in Discord. This role encompassed not only overseeing daily operations but also conducting weekly security trainings to fortify our community.\nIn addition, my expertise extends to structuring, implementing, and integrating diverse community engagement initiatives such as games and events within web3 projects. This approach aims at fostering community growth, maintaining consistent project vibes, and enhancing overall brand recognition. With a robust background in management, collaboration emerges as one of my core strengths.\nI am confident in my ability to seamlessly integrate this Bull Council role with my current day job, bringing forth a unique perspective and the potential to add considerable value across multiple levels.\n\nDoctorYev\nHello all, self-nominating myself for Bull Council. Some initiatives for BOTB growth might require tech partnerships or building, I can atleast help as a filter based on current BOTB backend of which tech is easy vs. hard to do. I'd also like to provide a balanced perspective across many factors for any new initiatives. Also I'm aware of friction between community and team... tech is in a unique position that devs usually don't care about any of that we come into any discussions from neutral perspective to make sure downsides are protected (security, etc) and upside is realized (good programmatic code and functionality) as long as goals area clear.\nI was only familiar with BOTB when BAP discussions started happening. I'm at about 20 BOTB assets and held all for 1+ year.\nIRL I had a semi-successful software that did marketing analytics for 1000+ ecommerce brands. From that I realized I really don't like the industry of marketing but I love productivity by taking an idea and making it a reality with tech or automation, and building tech that unblocks other tech (frameworks, modular features, integrative layers).\n\nCuban\nHello my name is Ulises Gámez, I have worked in the entertainment industry for over 20 years, Emmy Winner Cameraman! I would like to be part of this BC group. passionate about this brand currently with more than 120 Botb and I will continue adding more whenever I can... my rank on discord is number 7 and I have been promoting the project daily and making connections between communities for more than two years... I have skills in the filming and editing industry… I like video games and I see many possibilities in them and NFTs… I believe in teamwork, consistency and above all in things that are done with passion.\n\nDerek\nI’m excited and honored to be able to self-nominate for Bull Council 3.0. \nBull 5925 was my first BOTB acquisition, purchased on Oct. 12, 2021. I picked up Bear 5925 minutes later. Over the past 2+ years I’ve invested over 1 ETH into BOTB. \nI’ve worked in social media management and digital marketing since 2015. Prior to going full-time web3, I was Marketing & Operations Manager for a restaurant group. \nLast year I was under contract with BAP from March to September. \nThe fact I’m a BOTB OG and have worked with the company is an asset. I have open lines of communication and solid relationships with the 2 owners that are active and want to see BOTB succeed. I have been and will continue to push for BOTB initiatives, including the proposal for this election. \nI could go on about network, visibility, and a few other things. But this is already a TL; DR.\nIf you elect me, I’ll do everything in my power to raise BOTB to the legendary status it deserves. \n\nKimoraGold\nI would love to nominate myself. I am Kimora Gold. I have been part of the BOTB community since September 2021.\nI’ve seen BOTB in every different form and have experienced every single important moment of BOTB. \nI’ve started working for BOTB since 2021 until the acquisition in 2022. Then I’ve been working again since January 2023 until September 2023. Officially, the longest working member of BOTB.\nNow, I’m volunteering in BAPHouse with other community members ( Z devil, Cryptosheep, CryptoCaro, Wise Cloud and Absolute) to grow BOTB’s audience and to make BOTB a great project totally prepared for 2024.\nI currently work at the Innovation department of a fashion company in Milan.\nWhy do I want to be on the Bull Council? Because I am passionate about the project and I believe that since I know the company in and out, I can contribute to it’s growth and new Direction.\nI believe in BOTB because of the art & the history and the potential. But mostly, I believe in the community. While some think that Bulls are complaining and negative-minded. I think it’s a determined and dedicated community that only accepts the best and refuses to die.\n\nVoting will be open for 14 days.",

Now it's time to make a new and more efficient CW with less signers (5 persons) \nNote: Two actions will take place should this snapshot be approved. Removal of Anthony and reducing the number of singers to 5 rather than 10. It is important we act hastily currently. \n\nObjective \nThe assets and the signers of the CW to be community members that are not associated with the owning team and active members in order to have clear and concise communication as well as fast execution. \nVoting options \n\nYes: remove Anthony and reduce the number of cw signers 5 instead of 10\n\nNo: not remove Ant from the signers or decrease the signers\n\nVoting Period\nThe voting period for this snapshot is set to last for 48 hours from the time of posting and after 2 days of discord discussion.\nConclusion\nThis proposal aims to make the CW independent from the team and return the signs again to community that are not related to the team.\n Your participation in this vote is vital to making a well-informed and representative decision.",

      "title": "SP0042 - Proposal for \"Purchases for Approved 5E\" to Revitalize and Expand Marketing and Utility Opportunities for BOTB",
      "content": "Introduction\nAs we venture forward to rejuvenate the Bulls on the Block (BOTB) community, a well-recognized OG NFT collection, we are considering leveraging the current market conditions to connect with vibrant NFT collector communities. This proposal delineates the potential purchases from selected projects that have shown substantial promise and are aligned with our re-engagement strategy.\n\nProposal Details\nObjective:\nTo judiciously allocate a budget of 5E for acquiring assets from projects that have strong foundations and could facilitate vibrant collaborations, consequently enhancing BOTB’s visibility and engagement in the ecosystem.\n\nBackground:\nIn light of the bear market conditions, this proposal seeks to re-engage communities with members who were active during the summer of 2021. Leveraging the lower prices, the plan is to connect with communities possessing a robust NFT collector base, thereby revitalizing BOTB's presence and activity in the space.\n\nProposed Purchases:\nWe propose the following purchases with the respective reference floor prices (note: actual purchase prices may vary):\n\nDoodles: Reference Floor Price - 1.4E\nOtherdeed: Reference Floor Price - 0.60E\nCool Cats: Reference Floor Price - 0.55E\nAzuki Elementals: Reference Floor Price - 0.40E\nLil Pudgys: Reference Floor Price - 0.27E\nCyberKongz VX: Reference Floor Price - 0.12E\n\nBenefits:\nThis initiative aims to foster connections with communities boasting a robust NFT collector base. As an OG NFT collection, BOTB has a legacy to build upon. By rejuvenating these connections, we aspire to take advantage of the lower prices prevailing in the current bear market, thus providing an avenue to build relationships with likeminded communities.\n\nPotential Risks and Mitigation:\nThe primary risk associated with this venture is the prevailing bear market conditions, which might further depress asset prices. To mitigate this, we will undertake purchases ASAP, considering the floor prices and in consultation with Bullish Bear, who orchestrated this snapshot. Quick discussions on Discord will precede the execution of purchases to maintain transparency and incorporate community insights.\n\nImplementation Plan:\nThe selected assets will be acquired on an ASAP basis, adhering to the prevailing floor prices. The community, in consultation with Bullish Bear, will facilitate expedited discussions on Discord prior to finalizing and executing each purchase, ensuring that we act swiftly while maintaining a community-driven approach.\n\nDiscussion:\nCommunity members are encouraged to delve into the details available on Discord, engage in discussions, and voice any questions or concerns before voting.

      "content": "Introduction\nIn an effort to facilitate smoother transactions involving NFT assets, we propose delegating antmonge to use a dedicated MetaMask wallet for executing buy, sell, and transfer actions as determined by community snapshot votes. This proposal outlines the necessary details and invites community members to vote on this delegation.\n\nBackground:\nThe current Gnosis Safe wallet, while secure and facilitating multi-signature control, presents certain limitations when it comes to buying and selling NFT assets. To circumvent these limitations and streamline operations, the community is considering the use of a MetaMask wallet, which is known for its versatility in handling such transactions.\n\nObjective:\nTo delegate antmonge as the authorized user to execute buy, sell, and transfer actions through a designated MetaMask wallet as per the outcomes of community snapshot votes.\n\nThe Designated MetaMask Wallet Details:\nWallet Address: BOTB CW MetaMask - 0x07d02c689046CAf1d75C7cB6560C83Ed870f3675\nUsage: This wallet will be exclusively used for actioning snapshot votes.\nTransfer of Assets: Upon the final execution of snapshot instructions, the resulting assets will be transferred to the Gnosis Community Wallet (Address: 0x8Fd31f29c691A85f2b65759D81d0Ece9DF1582d7).\nDelegate Profile:\nantmonge is a well-recognized member of the Bulls on the Block community, having been fully doxxed and is known as the founder of the Bulls & Apes Project. This background places antmonge in a position of trust and reliability to handle this responsibility.\n\nVoting Options\nYes: You support delegating antmonge as the authorized user of the MetaMask wallet.\nNo: You do not support this delegation.\nAlternate Delegate Requested: You propose to consider an alternate delegate for this responsibility.\nDiscussion\nWe invite community members to discuss this proposal further and share their thoughts in the cgc-proposal channel on Discord.\n\nVoting Period\nThe voting period for this snapshot is set to last for 72 hours from the time of posting.\n\nConclusion\nThis proposal aims to enhance the efficiency of our community wallet's operations by leveraging the capabilities of a MetaMask wallet under the trusted management of antmonge. Your participation in this vote is vital to making a well-informed and representative decision.",

      "content": "--- Purpose ---\nThis Snapshot proposal is for Bulls on the Block Community approval to implement a process change that would grant the Bulls & Apes Project (B.A.P.) team the sole ability to execute Community Wallet transactions.\n\nNote - For those unaware, B.A.P. officially acquired the BOTB project in November of 2022.\n\n--- Details ---\nThis process change has been proposed to help with efficiency and speed in executing multi-sig transactions with the BOTB Community Wallet (CW) assets for the benefit of growing the BOTB Community. The B.A.P. team would be given control of the CW and would agree to only execute transactions voted on and approved by the BOTB Community through the snapshot voting process. This change would allow for doxed and anonymous BOTB Community members to participate in the BOTB Community Growth Council (CGC).\n\nThe Community Growth Council would stay intact but the current CGC members would be removed from the existing gnosis multi-sig Community Wallet. Five internally doxed B.A.P. team members would be added to the existing multi-sig wallet. The number of required signers needed to execute a transaction would be changed to 3 of 5.\n\n--- Voting Rules ---\nAll BOTB assets (OG Bull, Evo Bull, Bear) count as 1 vote.\n\nThe quorum will be set to 1,000 votes and a passing vote will be over 50% in favor.\n\nThe voting strategy will be Single Choice with the options of YES, NO, or ABSTAIN.\n\n--- Timeframe ---\n48-hour voting period",

I would love to have a chance. I really believe I can help our team in different way to move forward in the right direction. I have been working in the entertainment industry for more than 15 years. I’m a cameraman, but also I’m a editor and have some skills in the promotion business. I live in Miami Florida USA. I’m Cuban and American citizens holding more than 100 BOTB NFTs.\n\n-- Atmosphere 721#1372 --\nHi fellow Bulls, hope you're all doing well! I have been active in this space since the OG bulls launched. Currently full time into web3 and here to stay, despite current macro market conditions. Have minted, bought, sold, and held hundreds of NFTs. Have been seeing many fail and some win. I don't hold many BOTB, which makes me less biased imo, Like many of you, I'm just super emotionally attached to this project.  This is the first NFT I bought and I'm never selling it. I know there are more of you who are on the same page and we're here stay & build together. With that short introduction about myself and my experience out of the way, let's get into what's really important;\n\nThe future of BOTB First of all, I want to thank @ioannisgr for informing me about the important changes. I was not too active in here, since I had seen the BC working together like a dreamteam for a long time. Coming back to the drama, I was shook. Besides that, I love to see how things took such a positive turn after everything that happened. I feel that Ioannis really deserves a spot in the Community Growth Council. Furthermore, I want to help you out, since I'm here for the long term anyway. I feel transparent communication was handled terribly before the proposal and we could do way better. I'm not promising stuff, I feel like that's happening too much in this space already. We should deliver first, then surprise people with our accomplishments if we want to stay relevant. Not promising some shiny roadmap. I'm also definitely not going to brag with my holdings or with how much of an OG I am. The meta changes and so should we. Honestly, I wish to be able to contribute to the future of BOTB and to become a breath of fresh air with some new ideas. Thank you @antmonge - BAP and @TankMan | BAP & BOTB Team and all other involved for providing us the chance at a better future. Looking out to our future, regardless if I'm going to be in the CGC. And remember; Bulls Run Together\n\n-- AleHoup#3245 --\nI am AleHoup from France. True believer of this project as it is and will always be my first ever NFT. Holding around 40 bulls (OG+Evos) and a couple bears. I am an IRL marketing director with 10+ years experience in large groups to startups. Main expertise in digital marketing, business development, innovative and efficient business models and team management. Looking to broaden my horizons in web3. I'm here to help\n\n-- NonFungibleEsteban#9225 --\nHi bulls. I’m a 23 y/o Colombian based web3 degen, law student, python and blockchain enthusiast. I’m in the space since 2021 and want to be part of the team since is one of the og projects and the one I think have the best chance to glimpse in this bear market. I like marekting and have pretty good comunication/social skills. I can make copys in engelish and spanish as well. I’m here to grow\n\n-- MetaMatthew#8605 --\nHey everyone, Very excited about the place the project's at right now. With a competent team at the helm we have a great opportunity to get the project generating consistent momentum. I've been a holder since mint and am currently a top 5 holder in each collection.\n\nBackground:\nI spent my professional career designing and building various systems to support data science and distributed computing loads. I stopped doing that a few years ago and have been exploring the crypto space since.\n\n-- nordicmike#010 --\nHello everyone, it's Nordic Mike.\n\nI would like an opportunity to be on the cgc. I am rather new to discord but an old timer with botb. A bears on the block was my very first nft. I currently have 42 bears and 18 bulls. I am in it for the long run. I am a 53 years young. I am also an artist. I create sculptures out of wood using a chainsaw (lots of bears) and also enjoy abstract painting and other art as well.\n\n-- 天Keyword#31277 --\nHello guys, I am Keyword.\n\nI am a full-time senior digital marketer, I am not a very big holder, but BOTB represents around 20% of all my investments in crypto. I don't necessarily need to have an official role inside the community, but I just want to let you guys know that if you need help with anything that is marketing-related I can help you out.\n\nBy marketing, I mean all types of advertising (Twitter, Facebook, IG, Tik Tok, etc), and Search Engine Advertising (Google PPC ads or anything). Currently, I am learning Solidity and I started this journey a few months back so I have some experience with smart contracts already. I managed to deploy some smart contracts, and create a few tokens and NFTs on different testnets. If you feel like I can help you on the development side, I am here to try.\n\n-- Williams 🇨🇦#7126 --\nI would like to get involved. I am an auditor by profession and would be elated to help grow and support the community.\n\n-- TheCherp#4290 --\nHi BOTB Community,\n\nI am TheCherp and I'm 39 and live in New Jersey here in the US. For the collection, I currently hold 47 BOTB's and once Evo's open back up, i'll be close to 60 total BOTB assets for the collection (and plan on continuing to grow that number).\n\nI entered Web3 late in 2021. Throughout 2022, I experienced the rollercoaster that rocked the Crypto/NFT market with some really great projects/communities and a healthy dose of toxic leadership projects and of course a fair share of rugpulls. I cannot tell you how happy I am to have found this project and BAP. My 1st alpha group is Lobster Beach Club and have a lot of good friends in there where we always watch/support each others back. That is what I plan to do here, trying to help everyone as much as possible.\n\nIRL, I have built, ran and sold a web design agency (WordPress, Magento, etc) and helped another grow from 4 people to almost 60 people before exiting right as Covid began and turning my attention to my current world which is technology consulting/staffing. Today, I help to manage/run a team of 26 people and love what I do everyday. Outside of work, I also have 3 kids, coach all of their sports, play in 1-2 ice hockey leagues at any given moment and I'm excited to build for my families future.",

      "content": "##### *Current voting rules:\nBOTB-EVO only can vote on proposals, once 3500 BOTB-OG are claimed back the voting will be changed to include BOTB-OGs to vote. Quorum 500 votes.\n\n#### Replace Kevin Ren and Jackey JC on Bull Council with @Kimora Gold and @Cryptoblivious \n\n### WHY:\nThe Bull Council currently consists of 10 members, three of whom are\n@BigBull, @KevinRen and Jackey. All three members make up Bullish Labs who have an interest in acquiring the BOTB project.\nIt has been discussed within the community with concerns being raised over \na block of council members having a vested interest when they are intended to be independent, presenting a real possibility of transactions not being signed and a potential lock of the Community Wallet via inaction. \nDue to this conflict of interest it has become apparent they should be replaced on the Council by invested and active community members \nas outlined below. \nAdding weight to the reason for removal includes the fact that Kevin and Jackey have shown little to no interest in the BOTB community up unto this point in time with a clear lack of (almost zero) communication. See attached images. \n![kevin input.JPG](ipfs://bafkreihghvsdjov5rkt55ljlfcifljpczptaglpcl6h2p3eufzqazz3wxu) \n\n![jackey input.JPG](ipfs://bafkreihkdns2je2drezykkoxmeyhczeavjnyqtpbean4rc3j4njameaqhm)\n    \n    \nWe also require people who are contactable and responsive (at this point both only respond to BigBull)  in order to have transactions signed off on the community wallet hastily.\n\nBelow outlines the proposed members profiles and input withing the BOTB community to this point in time. \n\nVote Duration: 48 HOURS\n\n### About Kimora Gold\n\nI have been a holder of BOTB since Sept 2021. But most importantly, I have been working behind the scenes for Bulls On The Block since December 2021 (Almost a year). I have been part of every transition since and know the company on every front. \n\nI have worked on BOTB’s:\n1. Partnerships (SME)\n2. Community Management\n3. Social Media\n4. Content creation\n5. Communication with the community (also with the whole team)\n6. Constructed final reports for the Bull Council (with Cifer)\n7. Co-create the organizational structure of BOTB together with Cifer\n\nI have always acted in BOTB’s best interest and will continue to do so.\nBulls On The block is a part of my heart. Just like it’s a part of many people’s heart in this community. \n\nEducation & Career:\n1. Bachelor’s Degree in International Business and Management\n2. Entrepreneur \n\nI would love to continue working in BOTB’s best interest as the only woman on the council. I am truly committed to Bulls On The Block and am a strong believer in BOTB’s  bright future. I will be actively involved in the council and will be present on behalf of the community, with the ability to sign transactions promptly where required.\n\n### About Cryptoblivious\nI've been a member of BOTB since December 2021, been decently active ever since (#20 according to MEEE bot), have participated at some point in the structuring of the Discord server once taken over from the founders, have worked in a focus group with Baxter among others when we were looking to give some direction to the project for when the founders would leave.\n\nI personally own 7 Bulls and 2 bears. Represent(ed) roughly 30% of my expendable NW (not joking lol), so I'm pretty motivated to help our community thrive.\n\nI always try to make a fair point to stay polite and respectful in any conversation, and am always looking to understand other peoples points of view, whilst looking for solutions rather than brooding.\n\nLike @HeyI'mGary, I consider myself an independent free-spirited person with no conflicts of interest and no backdoor agendas regarding the project; just want what's best to keep this community and this project alive and prosper.\n\nSince I put my money where my mouth is, I've always been pro-doxxing for anyone taking important responsibilities, which is why I propose that you go check out my linkedIn profile if you're curious to put a face on a name https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrzej-wisniowski-77234376/\n\n#### VOTE DURATION: 48 HOURS",

People - 18 ETH\n2. LLC - 7 ETH\n3. Tech - 2 ETH\n4. Marketing - 4 ETH\n\nTotal budget 38 ETH\n\nThe budget can be downloaded in PDF format which has been uploaded to our Discord Announcements channel for review. \n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/853714611546357781/853717710567374869\n\nWe thank you all for your patience as we strive to put into place the building blocks BOTB requires and deserves to give it the recognition it deserves now and into the future.\n\nSnapshot Duration: 5 days.\n\nType of Vote\nYes\nNo\n\nDiscord - https://www.discord.gg/botb\n\nAppendix:  \n\n(FYI PDF in discord has more details)\n\nIn a 3 month period from 1 April 2022 to 30 June 2022, we will aim for a total of 3 full time and several part time team members to help build the BOTB community. This operational budget will be used for onboarding talent, retention, contributor remuneration, and community events.\n\nRemuneration for the current team will begin on 1 April 2022.\nFuture additions to the team shall go through a one-month evaluation period.\n\nAside from the remuneration beginning on 1 April 2022, there will be a one-time payment for work done by the contributors during the handover.\n\nThe requested budget shall be transferred from the Community Wallet Treasury to the Team Operational Gnosis Wallet if this snapshot is passed.\n\nThe operational gnosis wallet is secured by 5 trusted persons, several who are either Core Contributors or on the Bull Council: Cifer.eth (Bull Council), bigbull.eth (Bull Council), Nftdubcollector (LLC Custodian and Bull Council), PocoBear (Community member) and Evil (Bull Council)\n\nAll transactions from the operational gnosis wallet require 3 out of 5 to sign to complete the transaction.\n\nCurrent Treasury: As at 28 March 2022\n\nThe Community wallet - 53 ETH current exchange rates equals $177k USD total\nThe Team wallet - 15ETH $50k USD current.\n\nThere are approximate funds for 6 months operational costs (based on Zero new revenues). This snapshot is to approve a 3 month budget plan to be re-evaluated after 3 months.\n\nThe budget comprises two parts: transitional expenses; and future expenses.\n\nThe transition expenses have been discussed within the Bull Council. Other persons/companies (both part of and outside of the Bull Council) worked as paid consultants in various areas from legal, technology, accounting and operations. They have not been included in this proposal as their payments have already been settled. The Bull Council has visibility on many things and countless months of work done by the contributors in this proposal.\n\nTransition expenses\nThere is a partial expense related to compensating for previous contribution to this project and though this is well below the usual contributors market rates it shows an appreciation for the work that they did and what was accomplished getting the project into the control of the community.\n",

Will likely lead to a whole collection on Opensea.  (e.g. would have a full number such as 7000, 7777, 8888, 10000 etc)\n4. Community gets to vote on where the unclaimed EVOBOTB NFTs goes, if this proposal passes, there will be another vote on what we do with unclaimed EVOs.\n\nCons: \n1: Changing something decided before but not agreed by the community.\n2: People might remember the Oct 15 2022 date and not be able to check the proposals and governance votes in time.  This will be clearly be published in twitter and discord announcements.\n\nPlease vote in the best interest of BullDAO!\n\n Thanks for your vote!\n\nVote Options\nHow much notice does the Bull Council need to give the community to change the EVO claim period?\n\nOne week\nTwo weeks\nOne Month\nDon't Change \n",

The voting is setup and which amount of ETH gets the most votes will be the amount that gets staked. \n\nFYI Gnosis wallets are not supported yet on looksrare, so the funds will have to first be transferred to the bulldao single-signer wallet managed by Poco (See wallets below).\n\nThe LOOKS tokens will be bought using Uniswap and then staked on the website www.looksrare.org.  The Staking will auto-compound rewards.\n\nThe LOOKS will remain staked till another snapshot is made to change the status quo.\n\nThe funds will come from this account  https://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x7E3D3F0162bDEc5C86202a6A59d187fd2AFF226f/apps and the gas fees will be onto of the amount that will be staked. \n\nN.B.\n1. Given ETH Gas fees the larger the amount the lower percentage the transaction cost will work out to be. \n2. There are other options such as setting up a LOOK-ETH liquidity pool pair, however, do simplicity and to avoid potential impermanent loss the proposal is ONLY for normal staking.\n3. This is outside of any LOOKS to be claimed as Bulldao can't control when they are claimed from the bullsontheblock.eth wallet.\n\nLooksrare information\nhttps://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/looksrare\n https://docs.looksrare.org/about/rewards/looks-staking-rewards\n https://docs.looksrare.org/guides/getting-started/buying-looks\n\nProposal choices\nVote NO - 0 ETH\n1 ETH\n3 ETH\n5 ETH\n\nTime period \n24 hours\n\nWallet\nSource of funds\nhttps://gnosis-safe.io/app/eth:0x7E3D3F0162bDEc5C86202a6A59d187fd2AFF226f/apps\n\nPoco managed wallet to do the staking\nhttps://opensea.io/bulldao\n0x28451a35795d57f3c45c33b959214bdd68cabfab\n\nRisks\n1. Funds put into a single signer wallet, but this is a hardware wallet account and Poco is doxxed to Bull Council. \n2. LOOKS price may increase but could also decrease in value relative to ETH\n\nFor reference purposes only (Based at the time of writing the proposal) \n\nThis calculation includes both LOOKS and WETH earned through staking LOOKS.\n\nCurrent LOOKS APR\n361.92%\n\nCurrent WETH APR\n430.46%\nThe rates shown on this page are only provided for your reference: The actual rates will fluctuate according to many different factors, including token prices, trading volume, liquidity, amount staked, and more.\nTrading fees collected by the protocol are distributed to LOOKS stakers as rewards.

This is because only a select few have the ability to notify the community via Discord.    Also it requires the moderators to manually add an announcement which creates extra work load which could be used on other tasks.\n\nTo ensure fair marketing of proposals we need an automated process to alert the community when there is a new proposal added to Snapshot.\n\nThe snapshot bot has already been tested successfully in a testing server.  This function is already used by major discords such as Gnosis discord.\n\nIf this proposal is accepted, an administrator of the BOTB Discord will add the Snapshot Discord Bot (https://docs.snapshot.org/bots) and configure it to post announcements in the Discord to increase visibility.  \n\nTime\n48 Hours\n\nVoting\nSingle Choice\nY\nN\n",

      "content": "Hello Bulls and Bears!\n\nFor transparency, we want to announce a proposed change to the Bull Council. BullishBear has decided to step down and has nominated NeoApe to replace him. \nThis snapshot vote will be live for 48 hours for the community to approve NeoApe’s appointment to the council. \n\nHere are a few words from BullishBear\n\nMy original intention was to help out on the Bull Council until an ownership transition process was established and was moving forward in the right direction. The time is right for me to step aside and make room for someone with a different skillset. I have nominated Neo to take my spot given how much more significant an impact he can make with BOTB. I am excited about the direction things are going. \n\nStay Bullish!",
