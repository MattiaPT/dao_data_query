He was inspired by Easter Holy Week traditions in the Yaqui Indian communities of Arizona and Mexico, in which an effigy of Judas is led around the village on a donkey and ultimately set alight. Shuster and his friend, E. Dana Johnson, editor of the local newspaper, came up with the name Zozobra, which in Spanish means “anguish, anxiety, or gloom.”\n\nShuster’s creation first burned in his backyard in 1924 as a 6-foot effigy and, over the years, has grown to a towering 50-foot high marionette. Made of wood, wire, and cotton cloth and stuffed with bushels of shredded paper, which traditionally includes obsolete police reports, paid-off mortgages, and even divorce papers, Zozobra is a dark and eerie character, part ghost and part monster. Since those early days, the people of Santa Fe, families, and friends new and old, have annually made their way to Zozobra Field at Fort Marcy Park, a few blocks from the historic Santa Fe Plaza, to view this one-of-a-kind Labor Day Friday pageant.\n\nShuster personally oversaw the construction of the Zozobra figure until 1964, when he gave his detailed model and an archive of drawings and scripts to the Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe for their successful continuation of this historic tradition.\n\nIn an interview, Shuster commented on one reason for his continuing interest in producing the annual Zozobra show:\n“… the look in the youngsters’ faces as they saw this monster who might have stepped out of a fairy tale go up in smoke. That is a reason for Zozobra. He appeals to the childish fancy – in all of us. It is a scene from a fairy tale of our own making.\n\nA  gigantic wood, wire, and cloth effigy, Zozobra is one of the world’s largest functioning marionettes, able to wave his arms and move his head, using his mouth to growl ominously prior to meeting his demise. His arch-enemy, the Fire Spirit, dressed in a flowing red costume and headdress, is armed with a pair of blazing torches with which to end Zozobra’s reign of terror. The role of the Fire Spirit was originated by Jacques Cartier, former New York City ballet dancer and local dance teacher, who performed for an amazing 37 years. Cartier was succeeded by one of his students, James Lilienthal, who took over the Fire Spirit role in 1970, performing it for over 30 years and passing the role on to his daughter. Today, this coveted role is held by Santa Fe native, dancer Helene Luna.\n\nCartier talked about his experience over years spent as the Fire Dancer. “It damn near killed me half a dozen times,” he said, “and I even broke both my ankles; thank God, not at the same time.” Cartier noted that, “The idea of Zozobra grew out of a gang of Santa Fe deep-thinkers who met in something called ‘Society of Quien Sabe.’ They met once a month, and membership was based on how well you could tell yarns.”\nThe First Zozobra\n\nA description of the first public burning of Zozobra appeared in the September 2, 1926, edition of the Santa Fe New Mexican:\n\n“Following vespers at the Cathedral, a long procession headed by the Conquistadores Band marched to the vacant space back of the City Hall, where Zozobra, a hideous effigy figure, 20 feet high, produced by the magic wand of Will Shuster, stood in ghastly silence, illuminated by weird, green fires. While the band played a funeral march, a group of Kiwanians in black robes and hoods stole around the figure, with four others seated before the green fires.”\n\nWhen City Attorney Jack Kennedy (on behalf of the absent Mayor) solemnly uttered the death sentence of Zozobra (with Isadoro Armijo as interpreter) and fired several revolver shots at the monster, the green fires changed to red, the surrounding ring of bonfires were ignited, red fires blazed at the foot of the figure, and a match was applied to its base, the fire leaping into a column of many colored flames.\n\nAs it burned and the encircling fires blazed brighter, there was a staccato of exploding fireworks from the figure and roundabout. Throwing off their black robes, the spectators emerged in gala costumes, joining an invading army of bright-hued harlequins with torches in a dance around the fires as the band struck up “La Cucaracha.” The crowd then marched back between bonfires lining the streets to the armory and the big baile was on. It brought out the biggest crowd of native merrymakers seen here for years.”\nZozobra circa 1938\n\nThe Kiwanis Club of Santa Fe became officially involved with Zozobra in 1963, and on June 19, 1964, Shuster assigned all rights, title, and interest in Zozobra and the Club retains exclusive copyright and trademark to the effigy and images. The Kiwanis Club has faithfully continued the Zozobra tradition, and as the Club’s major fundraiser, the event has become a rewarding way for Santa Fesinos and visitors from around the globe to have fun and at the same time, participate in valuable community service.\n\nA little-known fact in the history of the Burning of Zozobra is that the old grouch has an elusive and equally grouchy cousin, Tio Coco, whom he summons to attend parties when he is unable or unwilling to make an appearance. Tio Coco was first introduced in 1940 at the behest of Warner Bros. Studios for the premiere of the movie “The Santa Fe Trail,” starring Errol Flynn, Olivia De Haviland, and Ronald Reagan. Tio Coco was invited by his cousin Zozobra to appear again as the special guest for the Convention of the Southwest District of Kiwanis International.\n\nThe Zozobra ritual endures to this day, providing the same release that creator Will Shuster noted in a card that he sent to a friend after the 1924 burning, “After the flames consumed the effigy, and the embers faded into the starlit Santa Fe sky, we stood together, a group unburdened. In the ashes of this effigy lay the worries of the past year, and from them, we shall rise anew, our spirits ablaze with hope and renewal. Tonight, we have not just witnessed a spectacle; we have participated in a sacred rite of purification, laughter, and rebirth.”",

Consider the DAO a small pool and the artists a lake.  Once the pool has been filled by the smart contract them the over flow will begin to fill the lake.  This will therefor perpetuate the DAO to go on to fund more and more projects over time.\n\nOur Genesis NFT drops will be packed full of utility for holders and signify a paradigm shift in how collectors interact with Artists in the future!\n\nNot only will this be an NFT drop, it will also be the beginning of the marketplace developed on the Santa Fe NFT platform built elusively to support creator royalties!  We know that in this exact moment royalties are in question but we at Santa Fe NFT know that creator royalties are what fuel Web 3 and what will perpetuate the growth of the NFT market!  100% CREATOR ROYALTIES!!!!! For artists and creators is why we moved into this space in the first place.\n\nWe are requesting 5eth to make this genesis drop a success.

      "content": "### Description \n\n**Santa Fe DAO** is a community-driven organization that supports the development and proliferation of traditional physical art and the art scene in Santa Fe, as well as digital art and NFTs. To increase awareness about our organization and mission, we propose a marketing push at events all around NFT NYC, with a **focus on onboarding** into the DAO and the Sante Fe art scene.\n\nThe proposal is to send a team of ambassadors to various NFT NYC events to engage with attendees and **spread awareness about Sante Fe DAO**. The ambassadors will carry informational materials such as pamphlets, brochures, and stickers to distribute to attendees. They will also be equipped with tablets or laptops to show attendees how to join our organization and get involved in our mission!\n\nIn addition to distributing materials, our ambassadors will also **host pop-up workshops** and **Q&A sessions** alongside an already organized event called W3BSTOCK featuring over 40 experienced artists, musicians, and community members from the Web3 and Traditional art scenes. I have **worked with artists from the Santa Fe art scene** doing large scale projection mapping for artists, one being **Kelly Moore**!  These sessions will provide attendees with insights into the Sante Fe art scene and opportunities to learn about the local culture and art community. The ambassadors will also showcase the work of Sante Fe artists, highlighting the unique perspectives and creative styles of the region. \n\nTo extend the reach of our marketing push beyond the events, our team of ambassadors will also **capture and create content** for **Twitter** and **other social media platforms**. They will document the events and showcase the work of Sante Fe artists, while also providing updates and insights into the ongoing activities of Sante Fe DAO.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5cLsysdm.jpg)\n\n### ROI\n\nThrough this marketing push, we hope to **engage** with a wide range of **attendees** at NFT NYC events and **create a buzz** about our organization and mission. By focusing on **onboarding** into the DAO and the Sante Fe art scene, we aim to **attract new members** to Sante Fe DAO who are interested in supporting and participating in the local art community. We believe that this approach will not only attract new members, it will be effective in fostering a vibrant and active community of traditional art, digital art and NFT enthusiasts who share our passion and values.\n\nWe can't wait to see the impact we can make at NFT NYC!\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vrm7b5km.jpg)\n\n### 👥 Team:\n\nMy name is Bloomz and I am a nounish builder, Artist, and Filmmaker.

      "title": "Denver Walls Documentary",
      "content": "# Denver Walls Documentary\nI would like to propose the creation of a documentary about the Denver Walls mural festival. As a filmmaker and avid fan of street art, I believe that this festival is an incredible opportunity to showcase the talents of local and international artists, and to explore the impact of public art on the community.\n\nThe Denver Walls festival is a yearly event that brings together artists from all over the world to create stunning murals and street art pieces throughout the city. The festival has been growing in popularity over the past few years, and I believe that a documentary about the event would be an excellent way to capture its unique spirit and share it with a wider audience.\n\nIn this documentary, I would like to interview artists, organizers, and community members to explore the stories behind the murals and the impact they have on the city. Through this project, I hope to inspire others to appreciate the beauty and power of street art, and to encourage more public art initiatives in Denver and beyond.\n\n## Creative Vision:\n\nOur vision for this documentary is to showcase the vibrancy and creativity of the Denver Walls festival, as well as the diverse voices and perspectives of the artists, organizers, and community members who make it possible. Through a dynamic and engaging storytelling approach, we aim to capture the essence of this exciting event and convey its significance as a celebration of art, culture, and community.\n\nOne of our main goals is to highlight the unique personalities and styles of the artists, who come from all over the world to participate in the festival. We plan to do this by including interviews with artists as they work on their murals, as well as by capturing footage of their creative process and unique approaches to street art. By showcasing the diversity of styles and techniques on display at the festival, we hope to inspire and educate viewers about the power of public art to transform communities.\n\nAnother key aspect of our creative vision is to showcase the role of the festival in promoting social justice and equity. By featuring interviews with organizers and community leaders, as well as highlighting the festival's commitment to supporting local artists and organizations, we aim to show how street art can be a powerful tool for activism and social change. Our goal is to challenge viewers to think critically about the role of public art in promoting social justice, and to inspire them to take action in their own communities.\n\nOverall, our creative vision is to create a compelling and visually stunning documentary that captures the energy and spirit of the Denver Walls festival. By showcasing the diversity of styles and voices on display at the event, as well as its broader social and cultural significance, we hope to create a film that will engage, inspire, and educate audiences around the world.\n\n## ROI\n\nWe believe that Sante Fe DAO would make an excellent partner for our documentary about the Denver Walls mural festival. As one of our valued sponsors, you would have the opportunity to support a project that highlights the vibrant artistic community in Denver and promotes cultural awareness and appreciation. In exchange for your support, we would offer Sante Fe DAO prominent placement in the film's credits and promotional materials, as well as recognition in all relevant press and media coverage. We would also be happy to discuss additional sponsorship benefits, such as exclusive access to behind-the-scenes footage and premiere event invitations.
