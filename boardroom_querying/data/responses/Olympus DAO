      "content": "At 7:49 AM CST on 9/21, our security partners at Hypernative detected unusual activity related to the recently deployed Cooler Consolidation Contract. After analyzing the situation, we identified the scope and nature of the attack and took immediate steps to mitigate it.\n\nAs of block 20799042, the total amount affected is $29,383.58 in DAI and gOHM. Though the consolidator was not a core Olympus contract, due to the small impact of losses incurred, we propose to reimburse the impacted users from the DAO Multisig, with the compensation to be denominated in gOHM.\n\nIf you are one of the five affected addresses that has not yet revoked both DAI and gOHM approvals, please do so as soon as possible. Any future losses resulting from failure to revoke these permissions will not be eligible for reimbursement.",

      "content": "*Snapshot note: this was originally posted on the forum as OIP-164 which is already taken by another proposal. To avoid collision, the number has been incremented to 165.*\n\n## Summary:\n\nThis proposal expands on OIP-163 (The Framework), implementing the same proposal with improved infrastructure via the Yield Repurchase Facility (YRF).\n\n## Proposal:\n\nImplement the YRF, which uses Axis Finance (formerly known as Bond) protocol markets to convert DAI into OHM. The YRF calculates inventory to convert each week based on the increase in the redemption value of sDAI in the clearinghouse and treasury over the preceding week (sDAI yield accrued), in addition to yield on Cooler loans calculated as principal receivables times 0.5% divided by 52 weeks. **Note that the usage of Cooler interest is an addition from the previous proposal.**\n\nThe YRF has an overseer, to be assigned to the current repurchase multisig, with the following permissions: to adjust the next weeks yield by -100% < X < +10% in case the expenditure is miscalculated; and to shutdown the facility and transfer any DAI or other tokens back to the treasury.\n\nThe YRF burns repurchased OHM at the end of each day and redeems them for 11.33 DAI each, to be used as inventory for the following day. This reduced backing number ensures the system remains properly collateralized and will not overspend even in case of fluctuations in the market value of volatile treasury assets like OHM-WETH POL.\n\n## Implementation:\n\nThe YRF can be activated via the provisioning of treasury withdrawer approval, in addition to the deployment of an upgraded Heart contract to update it at the start of each epoch.\n\n## Motivation:\n\nIncrease the automation and resilience of a component of the Olympus protocol.",

      "content": "## Summary:\nFollowing the adoption of the The Framework, this RFC seeks to open a brief discussion around adjusting a few key parameters in the RBS System that will ensure it is better turned for the current macro environment.\n\n## Motivation:\nWith the introduction of DSR yield being directed towards buying back OHM, it is important that we appropriately tune the upper quadrant of RBS so that it can create bond markets efficiently and effectively given the new market operations. Following the launch of buybacks, the market pushed OHM price into the upper cushion which produced a bond market for eight hours. While this behavior was working by design, the distance of the spread from the target price to cushion can be more effectively tuned.\n\n## Proposal:\nRecommendation to adjust the following RBS Parameters:\n- Adjust the upper spread between Target Price and Upper Cushion from 10% to 20%\n- Adjust the upper spread between Target Price to Upper Wall from 20% to 25%\n- Reduce the Upper Cushion and Wall capacity from 326k to 100k OHM.\nThe Lower Cushion and wall will remain configured the same as they are today (-10% to cushion and -20% to wall). \n\n![yEl01lM.png](ipfs://bafkreiex7d43nuepjuwv7gkadyubdbziakmmko6xqamrkftvauyposl7r4) \n![4wZBTq0.png](ipfs://bafkreidxlbjg6hi4rn54lcc6ki6aqajsuop3svrhtlz74sl7deebd3lmai)\n    ",

      "content": "## Summary\n\nTo be eligible for the airdrop, LayerZero is requesting a `RFP` from every eligible project.\n\nThe Protocol RFP (Request for Proposal) is the first step in the TGE allocation process, which gives each project the ability to establish its own allocation criteria relative to its overall token allocation.\n\nRelevant links:\nhttps://commonwealth.im/layerzero/discussion/17402-clarified-rfp-criteria\nhttps://commonwealth.im/layerzero/discussion/17246-protocol-rfp\n\n## Motivation\n\nWe are expediting the following OIP to have the community vote on the preferred distribution allocation for tokens that the Olympus Protocol is entitled to. Following the discussions made in the community discord and on the forum, we must now formalize and vote as a community before submitting to LayerZero.\n\n## Proposal:\n\nThe distribution criteria has certain restrictions as qualified in `Clarified RFP Criteria`.\n\n1. The developer allocation (maximum 10%) can be used for any purpose chosen by the developers, including expenses, audits, future community incentives, etc.\n\n2. Protocols cannot request an allocation for their treasuries; any such request must come from the 10% developer allocation.\n\n3. The remaining 90% allocation is intended as retroactive rewards for the users and community members of the protocol.\n\nBased on this criteria we propose the following for community consideration:\n\n**Option 1:**\n- 10% allocation to Devs / Olympus Treasury\n- 30% distributed to those that bridged 10 ohm or more before LayerZero Snapshot 1. \n- 60% to ohm/gohm holders (cooler loans count) before LayerZero Snapshot 1, with 10 ohm minimum\n\n**Option 2:**\n- 10% allocation to Devs / Olympus Treasury\n- 90% to to cooler loan holders before LayerZero Snapshot 1, 10 ohm minimum\n\nPlease note that a separate snapshot (OIP-162) is active, to decide on whether to apply an even distribution to all wallets meeting the criteria, or a weighted distribution based on amount of OHM held.",

      "content": "## Summary:\nIn support for the broader Olympus strategic vision and following the success of OIP-157, this proposal requests community approval for the creation of the following:\n\nDeployment of an OHM Bridge from Mainnet to Base, including relinquishing of contract roles following deployment, making the bridge immutable and secure\n\nCreation of 250k of v2/Full Range OHM/ETH liquidity on Uniswap Base\n\nFormation of this liquidity will create a foundation for third party CL Positions, as well as support for outstanding and growing participants in the OHM based ecosystem.\n\n## Motivation:\nAs a scaling effort, we propose the continued expansion of liquidity extended via a native, immutable bridge to Base. Completion of this effort will fund a minimum level of native liquidity ($250k), matching what was deployed on Arbitrum One. The creation of this bridge will round out planned expansion from Mainnet into two strategic, cost-effective rollups. This also allows all attention and resources to pivot to Berachain where the more substantial liquidity will form (The Bera recommendation is much more substantive than this and will be posted separately with a full scope).\n\nAt the time of writing, the following OHM synthetics exist:\npOHM (Ethereum) – 164,155 ($2m in TVL)\napOHM (Arbitrum One) – 45,155 ($541k in TVL)\n\nCombined, this represents the largest concentration of privately held OHM supply outside of Coolers. This liquidity is largely held in v2 Pools as a counter asset to more volatile pairs, allowing it to be arbed through POL and ultimately governed by RBS boundaries. By expanding to Base, we anticipate the bpOHM Pool to be of similar size to Arbitrum One and to scale over time.\n\nUltimately, the opportunity cost of deploying this POL is limited when compared to the returns. YTD, strategically positioning this liquidity into POL has grossed:\n$423k in DAI (Earned via Reserve Bonds and now held as sDAI earning 15%)\n7.32 ETH ($25,620) in Fees against OHM/ETH from Arbitrage\n2,032 ($25,115) reduction in OHM Circulating Supply earned as fees\n\nThis total gross amounts to $473k in accretive treasury growth over a three-month time horizon vs. $37,500 DAI that would have been earned in DSR. That's net $435.5k in income and climbing due to fee accrual.\n\n## Proposal:\n- Create a Base SAFE with 3/5 Signers identical to the Arbitrum One MS\n- Deploy a limited Default Framework Stack on Base as well as an Olympus Layerzero bridge contract exactly like Arbitrum One.\n- Relinquish Dev MS roles from the contract making the bridge immutable.\n- Bridge 125k of OHM liquidity through the native bridge to Base held by the SAFE MS\n- Bridge 125k of ETH to Base held by the SAFE MS\n- Using the Base MS create 250k of OHM/ETH v2 Liquidity on Uniswap\n\n## Summary of Requests:\nFormation of Default Framework OHM Layer Zero Bridge to Base - Target Due Date - April 12th\nFormation of 250k of OHM/ETH v2 POL on Uniswap - Target Due Date - April 17th",

      "title": "OIP - 159 Olympus x Gearbox: Enhancing OHM Utility and Maximizing DAI Yield",
      "content": "Dear Esteemed Olympians, I am amplice, hailing from the faraway lands of Leverage, here to bring you an offer of alliance that shall bring great fortune and prosperity to both our kingdoms!\n\nIn all seriousness, I'm here from Gearbox with a proposal that I think could benefit both our DAOs. I did a temp check in the general section of the forum and the feedback was pretty receptive so I'm moving on to making a formal proposal.\n\n## Introduction\n\nGearbox Protocol is a composable leverage protocol that aims to be the credit layer infrastructure for all your prime brokerage needs. It utilizes an account abstraction primitive called Credit Accounts, which are functionally a kind of leverage-enabled smart account that allows Gearbox users to put up to 10x more assets to work than they deposit. Some examples of things that Gearbox users can do include margin trading with leverage through Uniswap/Curve/Balancer, leverage farming on Convex pools/Yearn vaults, leverage staking via Lido, leverage restaking and leveraging points via EtherFi and Renzo, and leveraging NFTs/RWA/and other assets in the future. When users wish to withdraw funds, all they need to do is pay back the loan (plus accrued interest), and they can withdraw their original deposit + profits, with no fixed terms on the borrowed funds. This innovative approach combines lending and prime brokerage in the same protocol.\n\nGearbox has a strong track record, with V1 launched in December 2021, V2 in November 2022, and V3 going live in December 2023. The protocol has undergone 6+ audits with $2M+ spent on security, and has never experienced a security incident or bad debt to date.\n\n![mVL2xtr.png](ipfs://bafkreihygaw3t5o4zkx5lom3ow5wfh3i4jklfzrkzddh6wcpoaf6vw4gxe)\n\nWe are excited to propose a strategic collaboration with Olympus DAO that we believe will enhance the utility of the OHM and provide attractive yield opportunities for the DAO's substantial DAI reserves.\n\n## Proposal\n\n### Seamless OHM Deposit and Yield Generation\n\nGearbox Protocol will develop and implement a streamlined process for OHM holders to generate yield on their tokens without the need for active management. The proposed flow will work as follows:\n\nOHM holders will use their OHM as collateral on Olympus to borrow DAI (via cooler loans)\nThe borrowed DAI will then be automatically deposited into Gearbox's DAI lending pool\nOHM holders will earn attractive yields on the deposited DAI, paid out in DAI\nTo make this process as user-friendly as possible, we will integrate a dedicated deposit button directly into the Gearbox UI to completely automate this flow, such that it can happen in as few clicks as possible.\nThis will allow OHM holders to earn yield on their OHM with minimal hassle, in a way that does not require active management, and while maintaining their OHM exposure (via the loan). OHM holders won’t need to navigate between different platforms or perform multiple transactions manually.\n\nWe believe this would prove useful and profitable for OHM users because of the large rate differential that exists at the moment between the borrow cost for OHM holders on DAI and the yields that Gearbox is generating in our passive lending pools.\n\nFor reference, currently (as of 26th of March) our DAI pool is paying 32.46% organic APY, or 44.27% total APY if you include GEAR token incentives. Admittedly this is on relatively low TVL (2m at the moment). *However, our USDC pool, which has 53m deposited, is currently at 37% organic APY (38% with incentives), so even at scale our stablecoin pools are generating market leading yields.*\n\n![2cYBZea5.png](ipfs://bafkreigifrsyn7sjtl4vtotxitg647iybpr4tswdsvkx2c65q6en3mo62y)\n\nBenefits for OHM Holders:\n- Seamless yield generation on OHM holdings without active management\n- Holders can maintain exposure to OHM whilst still earning good yields\n- User-friendly experience with a dedicated deposit button and flow in the Gearbox UI\n- Passive yields in DAI in Gearbox are much higher than the borrow cost of DAI for OHM holders, making this an attractive opportunity\n\n### Olympus DAO Treasury: DAI Deposit\n\nGearbox Protocol has recently created a DAI lending pool. As a part of this overall plan, we propose that Olympus DAO considers depositing 2-5 million DAI (initially) into our lending pools. Our reasoning is as follows:\n\nCurrently, Gearbox allows leverage on some very popular strategies (e.g., Ethena shards farming via USDe and sUSDe), which has led to extremely high utilization rates and thus APYs on our USDC pools. Our USDC pools are seeing 37% organic APYs (38% when GEAR incentives are included). Borrowers who want to deposit into popular stablecoin strategies are likely somewhat agnostic about which stablecoins they use. Therefore, we can assume borrowers would be happy to borrow DAI (rather than USDC) in order to enter into various leveraged stablecoin positions. Our DAI pools are extremely new (just a few days old right now), but if the medium term borrow demand is at all similar to what we have seen with USDC, it's plausible that DAI will have a source of organic yield that is 25%+ or even 30%+. If this plays out, the organic DAI yield available on Gearbox will likely be market leading compared to any other yield on DAI available on the market.\n\nThe reason we're able to have these such APYs in our lending pools is as follows:\n\nThe DAI pool that Olympus DAO would be depositing into is structurally similar to the lending pool in any other lending protocol. It’s a pool of DAI that borrowers can take loans from and when they repay the loan they need to do so with interest.\n\nThe difference is on the borrowing side - borrowers can take this DAI and use it (with up to 10x leverage) in various different strategies that are whitelisted by Gearbox. One example that is driving the demand for leverage in Gearbox right now is Ethena’s USDe.\n\nBecause there is huge demand for levering up and aping into USDe (partially because people are farming Ethena shards), borrowers are willing to pay a lot to borrow stablecoins in Gearbox. Most of this high interest rate on the borrow side is passed on to the lending side, therefore Olympus DAO would be getting exposure to high yields without taking on all of the risks associated with directly participating in higher risk strategies (like USDe).\n\nPlease note that this is not “risk free” - as is the case with Aave (or any other lending protocol), there is always the risk of bad debt. But bad debt would only accumulate in a situation where some strategy drops in value faster than liquidation bots can liquidate borrower positions. Also, Gearbox v3 has built in risk management on this front - we have quotas, which limit the TVL that can be used in any given leverage strategy and/or asset. This prevents any particular strategy from posing a systemic risk to Gearbox or its lenders.\n\nWe are able to maintain high utilization ratios and therefore high passive lending APYs thanks to the demand for leverage on these riskier strategies (like USDe), but the majority of the risk is taken on by the borrower that’s using leverage.\n\nAs long as there continue to be various popular stablecoin strategies available to be leveraged on Gearbox, utilization ratios on our stablecoin lending assets should continue to be high, translating to attractive APYs in DAI.\n\nThis means that Olympus DAO could have an enduring, long-term, high organic APY option available for its substantial DAI reserves that is not subject to the whims of various token prices or incentive programs.\n\n### Benefits for Olympus DAO:\n- Exceptional organic yield generation on the DAO's substantial DAI reserves, outperforming most other available options for yield, and not dependent on any token inflation or incentives from other projects.\n- Strategic diversification of treasury investments, mitigating risk and exposure to market volatility\n- Opportunity to support the growth and development of a promising DeFi protocol, fostering ecosystem collaboration and innovation\n- Olympus DAO would be additionally farming $GEAR, which represents some level of upside (as long as you don’t dump on us😏), giving Olympus a level of influence and governance sway over Gearbox DAO (note: $GEAR tokens will likely only be a small portion of the total yield for Olympus, vast majority of the yield is organic)\n\n### Benefits for Gearbox Protocol:\n- Help with bootstrapping Total Value Locked (TVL) in the newly added DAI pools on the lending side, bolstering the protocol's liquidity and stability\n- Enabling a greater number of leverage side users, driving platform adoption and growth\n- Forging a strong, mutually beneficial partnership with Olympus DAO, a highly respected, well capitalized and influential player in the DeFi space\n- Opportunity to co-market with Olympus and outreach to the OHMies (who are mostly grizzled DeFi veterans at this point)\n\n## Proposal Execution\nIf approved, Gearbox protocol will be responsible for the execution of the seamless OHM>DAI loan + deposit into Gearbox. This will be added to the Gearbox UI in the near future and will be promoted on Twitter and other relevant channels.\n\nOn the Olympus DAO deposit side, your DAO/protocol will be responsible for the execution via the usual processes that you use for the deployment of treasury/protocol funds.\n\n*Snapshot note: conclusion section removed to fit into the 10,000 character limit.

The Association is an independent non-profit organization without any commercial purpose. The main goals are to research, develop, operate, and maintain Olympus, while developing Olympus Ecosystem and defending the interests of its members.\n\n## Motivation\nThe motivation for this proposal is to continue to fund the Olympus Association so that it may execute the budget approved by the Olympus DAO community.\nThe Olympus Association is important for providing contributors a formal structure to coordinate work, and compensations, and establish relations with other organizations and contractors in order to fulfill the Olympus Protocol vision. The Olympus Association provides its members the necessary legal representation to increase efficiency and efficacy. Importantly, this OIP does not change or increase the overall budget. The budget approved in OIP-158 applies, and the funding of the association is contingent on the successful passing of OIP-158 on snapshot.\n\n## Proposal\nWe seek authorization from the Olympus DAO Community to fund working capital based on the budgeting needs of Olympus Association. The current request is for covering 2024 marketing and communication expenses, for a total of 75,350 DAI in OHM. The DAO will execute quarterly funding to support the Association running costs, within the approved 2024 budget.",

      "title": "OIP-157: Q2 FY24 Layer 2 POL / Liquidity Plans",
      "content": "## Summary:\nAs the macro shifts and rollups gain favor, it becomes necessary to once again explore tasteful OHM based POL to facilitate market growth.\n\nIn support of these emerging markets, this proposal requests community approval in the creation of the following:\n\n250k of v2/Full Range OHM/ETH liquidity on the Camelot DEX\n\nFormation of this liquidity will create a foundation for third party CL Positions, as well as support for outstanding and growing participants in the OHM based ecosystem.\n\nThis can also pave the way for some variant of bespoke liquidity management on a chain by chain basis.\n\n## Motivation:\nIn Q1 FY24, optimistic community members capitalized private liquidity in support of a grassroots partnership with Peapod Finance in hopes of expanding OHM utility to the broader market. 250k of OHM was wrapped as pOHM and paired with 250k of DAI to form the pOHM/DAI Pod at the genesis of their v2 launch. It strategically positioned pOHM as an alternative POD (LP) Pairing to DAI, allowing an arbitrage path against OHM/ETH POL and OHM/USDC liquidity, while also giving pod creators (Protocols) an unpegged, fully backed option to consider.\n\nFollowing the v2 Launch, pOHM TVL has grown to $3.27m, making it the largest concentration of wrapped OHM liquidity in the market today.\n\nSource:\nhttps://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/dashboards/view?dashboardID=a44c5363-4a35-48b3-b210-2aacc7267cab\n\nSubsequently, pOHM has found itself as the anchor point for roughly 19 discrete Pods, all of which have been privately sourced by third parties, in the free market, with no direct protocol incentive or inflation.\n\nSource:\nhttps://dune.com/spoysp/peapods\n\nThe initial wrapping of this liquidity for the v2 Launch led to a 15% appreciation in OHM Price, triggering the first entry ever into the RBS Upper Cushion. This allowed for the issuance of Reserve Bonds, adding $422k DAI to the treasury’s balance sheet which became a part of backing and was rolled to sDAI.\n\nSource:\nhttps://dune.com/spoysp/olympus-rbs-dashboard\n\n## Proposal:\nLooking to the future, there are L1’s (Berachain) and several L2’s (Arbitrum One, specifically) that have emerging economies where the presence of OHM liquidity can facilitate synergistic growth. Since there is only a fixed amount of Protocol Owned Liquidity that can be introduced into the market while maintaining existing, immutable dependencies, this proposal seeks to provide a near term framework and open the door for a more long term vision.\n\n**Phase 1:**\n\nThis proposal conservatively considers the covenants and dependencies created by Cooler Loans:\n\nLiquid Treasury Valuation - $188,866,883\n5% Not Allocated to Coolers - $9,443,344\nLess FY24 Proposed Budget - $8,014,344\nLess Proposed Arbitrum One POL DAI - $7,889,344\n\nAs OHM in POL is not counted towards liquid backing, the Arbitrum One proposal would move 125k of ETH from reserves to the new v2 LP. This DAI amount creates no material threat to existing covenants and, if Cooler Loan borrow amounts and the DSR rate remain roughly stable in FY24, we could expect a gross inflow of approximately 3.6m DAI to reserves, offsetting this shift. A v2 pool is recommended such that a full range of liquidity can be formed and rewards do not require a discrete multisig interaction to compound (In line with our automated future).\n\nThis will create a base layer of OHM liquidity for protocols and liquidity providers to build from, also creating short term, immediate support for efforts in the space. It is also plausible that OHM/gOHM CL will form once again, connecting the existing 138k gOHM/ETH third party liquidity on Sushiswap back to the framework.\n\nIdeally, third party CL will emerge over the top and we anticipate a reasonable outflow of liquidity from Mainnet to Arb One as retail gets priced out of Ethereum and seeks lower friction options. Lastly, this move will meet the anticipated demand created by a partnership that has already sunk substantial supply and created favorable utility for OHM.\n\nThis ask is specific to Arbitrum One and does not include any other future efforts. Subsequent efforts (Such as Berchain) would have this own discrete OIP and terms.\n\nThis effort will make explicit use of 0x012bbf0481b97170577745d2167ee14f63e2ad4c which is the already existing Arbitrum One Multisig that holds the JONES. This MS has previously governed several million in OHM/USDC and gOHM/ETH as POL. These pools were pulled down, liquidated and brought to mainnet for the Cooler launch in the event that there was a total redemption, and the capital was needed there.\n\n**Updates born of the RFC Process:**\n\nDiscussion born of the RFC produced a revised clarification that the OCA Integration be moved out of scope such that it didn't block the ask entirely.\n\nLastly, there was request to make it explicit that since OHM still remains outside of Snapshot based voting (Only gOHM and sOHM are allowed) that OHM wrappers such as pOHM and apOHM would also be excluded. Users participating in these systems will not have that OHM recognized by Snapshot with voting rights.\n\n**Phase 2:**\n\nExploration into more holistic liquidity management at a cross chain scale. If OHM based POL is a finite, but important resource, a scaling solution is needed such that it can be tastefully positioned to facilitate aligned participants.\n\nBaseline Protocol is demonstrating what an opinionated Market Maker can look like but, they have also provided a liquidity tech stack worth exploring from the lens of pool management.\n\nElastic Finance recently created a $1m EEFI/OHM Uni v2 Pool and it begs the question if additional tooling would be helpful such that interested parties can build.\n\nUltimately, post Cooler POL is bound by circulating supply and treasury reserves. Since supply is actively managed by RBS but also largely fixed unless we are in either cushion, we are mostly bounded by the treasury growth at 5% (DSR) + 0.5% Cooler Lending Interest. This creates a tangible liquidity budget we can, and should, consider in our future planning.\n\nSummary of Requests:\n- Formation of 250k of OHM/ETH v2 POL on Camelot\n- Tangible support of synergistic partners\n- Individual educational awareness around ongoing business development that has proven successful in increasing OHM Market Share.",

      "content": "## Summary\nFollowing the effective execution of OIP-148, the DAO presents the subsequent framework for budget and ongoing operations.\n\n## Motivation\nFrom its inception, OHM’s vision has revolved around being a decentralized, automated, and fully autonomous currency. Over the last 6 months, the DAO has dedicated substantial effort to implement Cooler Loans, OCA, RBS Upgrades, Cross-chain Bridge Support, OCG, and work towards decentralized front-ends, nearing the goal of protocol automation.\n\nWhile the protocol is focused on autonomous operation, there are particular components essential for improving user interaction, which still require monitoring and financial support.\n\nAdditionally, there are several projects that have shifted or been created since the inception of OIP-148:\n\n1. Decentralized Front Ends\n2. RBS Tuning\n3. On Chain Governance Phases\n\nDuring this transition to OCG, additional projects that impact scope, such as the Blueberry Proposal, may cause delays.\n\nIt's important to consider that the approved 2023 budget was executed with a savings of 15%, or $817k, due to the continued successful implementation of efficient and cost control measures. This 2024 budget is based on estimations using the best available information expected for 2024. We estimate that 2024 budget impact in liquid backing will be between 0.03 and 0.04.\n\n## Proposal\nThe following budget is proposed to carry development through the end of January 2025, unused funds shall be returned to the DAO wallet. \n![screenshot 14.png](ipfs://bafkreibvqglh5fffjv3j5wsm5i5mtko3e2vd7pbxyoxavoqp3w6ylrxfxi)\n\n## Subscriptions and Other Operational Costs\nThe below list contains rough examples after each item. These are not all encompassing and are subject to change.\n\n1. Monitoring and Maintenance\nBug Bounty Monitoring, Forum Maintenance, Cooler Maintenance, Front-End (FE) Operations Checks\n2. Platform Management\nGitHub, Docs, dApp\n3. Legal and Governance\nLegal Expenses, Governance Monitoring\n4. Communication and Coordination\nDiscord, Emergency Management Systems, Emergency Response*\n5. Risk Management and Analysis\nRBS Monitoring, Treasury DSR Interaction Monitor\n6. Content and Management\nFleek, GoogleCloud, Notion, etc\n7. Social Media and Public Relations\nTwitter Management, Consolidation of Other Media\n8. Treasury Management\nConsolidation Plans and Schedule\n\n*Emergency Response refers to necessary remediation for emergent issues that may arise. The Emergency Multisig is a separate function, and is not compensated for this contribution.\n\n**Variable expenses that are not included in the above projections, but are within the purview of the association are:**\n\n1. Immunefi Bug Bounty Payouts + fees (fees are dependent on payouts)\n2. Unforeseen Legal Expenses\n3. Audits, given scope and development\n\n**Variable expenses that are not included in the above projections, and require approval:**\n\n1. Specific bounties to grow the protocol (Separate request)\n2. Services from 3rd party contractors (Separate request)\n\nThe resulting budget of $888,000 is around 15% of the 2023 Budget of $5,980,000. Showing ongoing reduction and consolidation of efforts.",

The Association is an independent non-profit organization without any commercial purpose. The main goals are to research, develop, operate, and maintain Olympus, while developing Olympus Ecosystem and defending the interests of its members.\n\n## Motivation\nThe motivation for this proposal is to continue to fund the Olympus Association so that it may execute the budget approved by the Olympus DAO community.\n\nThe Olympus Association is important for providing contributors a formal structure to coordinate work, and compensations, and establish relations with other organizations and contractors in order to fulfill the Olympus Protocol vision. The Olympus Association provides its members the necessary legal representation to increase efficiency and efficacy. Importantly, this OIP does not change or increase the overall budget. The budget approved in OIP-155 applies, and the funding of the association is contingent on the successful passing of OIP-155 on snapshot.\n\n## Proposal\nWe seek authorization from the Olympus DAO Community to fund working capital based on the budgeting needs of Olympus Association. The current request is for covering 2024 expenses, for a total of 1,429,000 DAI in OHM. The DAO will execute quarterly funding to support the Association running costs, within the approved 2024 budget.",

      "title": "OIP-152: On-chain Governance",
      "content": "## **Summary**\nThe present goal of the DAO is to get the protocol into a [fully autonomous state](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/4047-oip-148-towards-a-fully-autonomous-olympus-20) by end of January, while taking the path of least risk. This OIP aims to show how adopting a governance-minimized philosophy with the right Governor Bravo parameters is the optimal path to achieving the protocol's goal by the specified timeline. The below plan proposes a two-stage rollout of on-chain governance:\n* OCG Stage 1 (end of January 2024) - introduce Governor and deprecate Policy MS\n* OCG Stage 2 (end of Q3 2024) - migrate remaining DAO MS to Governor\n\n*[Snapshot note: the following section is presented in a compressed format to conform to the 10,000 character limit]:*\n\n![screenshot 6.png](ipfs://bafybeib3as5exhe7xiebghkc5sxfymrhoqpxzj7e3nikjoheufpkzaggwa)\n \n![screenshot 7.png](ipfs://bafkreiahwxiggnl5o2rj7nfvh2rozntrbu2m6brpniifrsxfllrhvbfu3m)\n \n![screenshot 8.png](ipfs://bafybeie3psnzqp4txnszqv3v4xbjyvflg2b2xs6xhfdmx5ws2afsqcjkri)\n    \n\n## **Implementation**\nTo implement a governance-minimized structure, we have two potential solutions: Governor Bravo or a custom implementation. The custom governance system evolved through the course of extensive feedback and iteration. After multiple debates surrounding several of the mechanisms, [this RFC](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/4058-introducing-parthenon-olympus-on-chain-governance) was shared but the conversation stalled with no clear next steps or buy-in from tokenholders. Given the lackluster response, it’s time to consider the alternative.\n\nGovernor Bravo is simple, battle-tested by major protocols (including Uniswap and Compound) on $10B+ in TVL, and addresses all of the governance problems Olympus faces today. It minimizes technical risk toward full automation because any custom implementation would require dev and time resources, taking focus away from current RBS 2.0 audit.\n\nWhat about governance risk? Governor Bravo uses Minimum Quorum (defined as minimum FOR votes) to pass proposal. Olympus introduces an additional governance lever, Majority Approval (defined as minimum percent of FOR votes relative to total votes needed). To evaluate potential governance attacks, it's useful to view governance as a game where tokenholders are choosing strategies that optimize payoffs against malicious, and non-malicious, proposals in low-consensus, and high-consensus, environments. The two dimensions and their dominant strategies can be visualized as follows:\n\n![screenshot 9.png](ipfs://bafkreieikg7qfdolsvx4bnw7kvoqatozcdazquq4pq4tz73t2p4fauevsa)\n\nGiven the permissionless vision of Olympus, it’s almost certain we will experience every configuration of proposals. The governance parameters we choose today should provide the necessary tools for tokenholders to govern through all such configurations. What should quorum and majority approval be for each dominant strategy? The summary is below:\n1. (High consensus, not malicious) = low quorum\n2. (High consensus, malicious) = high quorum, high majority approval\n3. (lack of consensus, malicious) = high quorum, high majority approval\n4. (lack of consensus, not malicious) = high quorum, low majority approval\n\nA detailed analysis is available [here](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/4084-rfc-governance-path-forward/18).\n\n## **Parameters**\nBased on the above analysis and discussions in RFC, I propose the following:\n* Spot gOHM and gOHM escrowed in contracts with delegate ability get voting power (i.e. Cooler Loans)\n* Minimum quorum: 20% of gOHM supply voting FOR\n* Majority Approval: 60% of FOR votes relative to total votes\n* Proposal Threshold: 10 gOHM (this is ~$31K or 0.017% of supply)\n* Voting Delay: 3 days\n* Voting Period: 7 days\n* Timelock: 1 day\n\nA proposal can only pass if both minimum quorum and majority approval is satisfied. As an example, 20% quorum implies at least 11,994 gOHM must vote FOR in a proposal (20% of 59,970 at time of writing). If the majority approval is 60% and 15,000 gOHM vote FOR but 11,000 gOHM vote AGAINST, then the proposal would fail because approval was only 57.7% (as 15000 / (11000 + 15000) &lt; 60%).\n\n![screenshot 10.png](ipfs://bafkreighbacrfbuimq4s5e2tpc6j3zcvpvhnjagynacuqj4lpquwt5rpeu)\n\n## **Roadmap**\nOlympus today is governed by three multisigs (DAO, Policy and Emergency) with responsibilities defined through [Default Framework Roles](https://docs.olympusdao.finance/main/security/roles/#relevant-multisigs). A successful transition requires a migration plan for all roles and multisigs to on-chain governance. To balance execution efficiency and security, we propose a two-stage migration plan over the course of ~9 months, in the event the DAO or the Olympus Association finds security or legal concerns with respect to eliminating the DAO MS in favor of Governor Bravo, then this step might be delayed till all warrantees are in place:\n1. OCG Stage 1 (end of January 2024) - introduce Governor Bravo and deprecate Policy MS\n2. OCG Stage 2 (end of Q3 2024) - migrate remaining DAO MS to Governor\n\n### **OCG Stage 1**\nThe high-level goals in this stage are as follows:\n1. Deploy Governor module (the on-chain governance module)\n2. Migrate Cooler Loans and BLV to Governor\n3. Deprecate Policy MS\n\nThe specific implementation is proposed below:\n\n![screenshot 11.png](ipfs://bafkreih354ltrjg3wty4c6h57oxbt3qnsrhaarsl3uexyn7tliirkiks2a)\n\n### **OCG Stage 2**\nThe high-level goals of this stage are:\n1. Migrate executor and admin roles to Governor.sol. Any future upgrade will go through on-chain governance\n2. Migrate remaining DAO MS roles\n\nThe specific implementation is proposed below:\n\n![screenshot 12.png](ipfs://bafkreih3awuhv3yuyeggoisumepm3hxqos5pm2n6ohlqleml6zjacljefi)\n\n![screenshot 13.png](ipfs://bafkreiemf6xbw7zbwcufdguf3sh6ftgrubrdu7abtvtvqgy35k4rn4ixvy)",

The current parameters, which offer 10% of supply on the upper wall and 1% daily emittance in the upper cushions, is too extreme to accomplish the aforementioned goal. It also provides a large source of liquidity which could be abused by a malicious actor.\n\nI feel this change is urgent, and I am trying to push a governance timeline that reflects that. Considering more harm can be done by a too-funded RBS system versus a not-funded-enough system, I suggest a liberal capacity change now that may be reverted or augmented in the days and weeks that follow. Keep in mind that, though RBS launched over a year ago, this is the first time the upper range has been tested. I see this as similar to a launch day problem, though the process of fixing it is more tenuous than it might have been day one.",

      "title": "OIP-151: Approval to swap some $sDAI Treasury to mint $stTBY",
      "content": "# Summary\nRequest for community approval to swap some (up to you, minimum $1M) of $sDAI treasury remainder (after cooler loan allocation) to mint StakeUp’s $stTBY, and receive free volatile token allocation, which could be airdropped to holders.\n\n# Motivation\n\nOlympus is at a stage where the treasury is focused on providing liquidity to holders through cooler loans, but the un-allocated remainder could also be put to use to benefit holders. Rationally, the DAO has been holding sDAI to capitalize on the high interest rate environment. stTBY presents a de-risked, community-driven alternative to sDAI. sDAI currently yields 5% and is dependent on the % of DAI supply staked in the savings rate contract as well as subject to MakerDAO governance (the savings rate has been lowered before), stTBY offers a more robust design with rates that are directly linked to US treasury bills, currently yielding 4.7%. At the same time stTBY also offers token supply ownership at no cost, with exponential potential for growth. In exchange for seeding stTBY liquidity, the DAO will receive 0.25% token supply / $M supplied. At $10M supplied, this would equal 2.5% of total $SUP volatile token supply. The DAO could contribute as little as $2M or as much as $20M to be eligible, at the same terms ($SUP allocation adjusts respectively).\n\n## Airdrop to OHM Holders?\n\nInstead of retaining the $SUP allocation in the treasury, the tokens could be airdropped to Ohm holders. The DAO would end up achieving the same goal of providing cooler liquidity to holders while now also offering asymmetrical upside.\n\nPut simply\n\n$stTBY is designed to reinvent the Circle/Tether model in a fully decentralized way that shares all value with its users. This proposal allows OlympusDAO to own a significant piece of that without taking additional economic risk, simply mint and hold the stablecoin while still earning treasury yield.\n\n## How stTBY works\n\nstTBY is a rolling yield vault, 1:1 mint/redeemable for USDC, which generates yield from Bloom TBYs. Bloom TBYs (docs.bloom.garden) are economically equivalent to treasury bills, as they produce yield by lending over-collateralized against treasury bill tokens. This means that yield and the stablecoin itself is ultimately secured by the value of the treasury token collateral. Unlike other RWA protocols, due to the loan structure, there are no KYC requirements or transfer restrictions. Therefore, the method of yield production is similar to that of MakerDAO, however, the risk is much more isolated as there is only one collateral asset. Further, the contracts are non-upgradeable and uncensorable, whereas sDAI could be censored in the future or risky collateral added to the system. stTBY presents a clean, safe yield opportunity for treasury management.\n\n## How $SUP Works\n\n$SUP is the yield-bearing utility token for the StakeUp ecosystem. $stTBY charges three fees: Mint fee (1bps), Redeem Fee (50bps), and Performance Fee (10% yield). Rather than being hoarded by a DAO treasury, 100% of fees go directly to $SUP stakers. Staking $SUP does not require a time lockup. As an early holder of a significant amount of circulating supply, OlympusDAO (or Ohm holders if Airdrop to holders route is preferred) would receive a high share of these fees during the startup phase. Then of course, the price of $SUP should change with the stTBY’s TVL, which will be heavily incentivized.\n\n## Where is the treasury collateral ultimately held?\n\nThe tokenized treasuries are issued by Swiss RWA token issuer Backed. Backed’s DLT program registration guarantees that even in the case of an exploit, value can be recovered through the Swiss courts. This process has been tested and verified by the StakeUp team. Custodian info for ib01 can be found at Backed.fi.\n\n## $SUP Tokenomics\n\n49% of the supply is allocated to the team, investors, and launch partners including deals like this. 51% of the supply will be distributed to the community programmatically in support of mint volumes and deep curve pool liquidity.\n\n## OlympusDAO Treasury\n\nOlympusDAO Treasurywill have the option but NOT the obligation to provide stTBY or DAI as liquidity on Curve to earn additional $SUP, $CRV rewards and trading fees.\n\nBasic Revenue Model\n\nRevenue Model\n\nData Sources Supporting the thesis\n\nStakeUp Docs\n\nHere is a basic model showing how much you would make vs treasuries if the $SUP tokens stayed at launch/raise FDV\n\nThe v1 of Bloom did a test launch with $2.2M TVL without the stablecoin model. Users gave feedback that they would mint much more if it were a stablecoin.\n\nProject recently raised a $2M round led by $1.5b US Fund White Star Capital, previously backed by Chainlink Labs, BitScale VC (Lido), and angels from top DeFi teams.",

      "title": "OIP-150: Decentralized Front-ends for Olympus",
      "content": "# **Summary**\n\nFollowing the earlier [RFC](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/4071-rfc-decentralized-front-ends-for-olympus), this OIP supports the creation of a system of decentralized Olympus front-ends, hosted and managed by third parties. With the ongoing decentralization efforts (e.g., OCG, open development) there is one remaining residual centralized element in the proposed structure that could be a risk factor, the Olympus website/front-end itself. This OIP advocates for the adoption of a modified version of Liquity’s decentralized front-end system, in order for Olympus to become fully decentralized on a smart contract level, on a front-end level, and on a development level.\n\n\n# **Background**\n\nThere are a several reasons why the model of decentralized front-ends is desirable and indeed justified given the current state of the protocol:\n\n\n\n* Following OCG and without a group of core contributors the current hosting set-up will likely need to be discontinued or changed as well. Since the majority of users connect to the contracts through the official website an alternative solution needs to be developed.\n* Recently announced legislation such as MiCA in Europe seems to make a distinction between DeFi that is _actually_ decentralized and \"DINO\" protocols. In this context, decentralization seems to refer to 1) permissionless contracts, 2) not a single entity controlling or managing the development of or core services to the protocol, and 3) multiple front-ends through which a user can interact with the contracts. While legislation of this type is still novel, it is worth considering the future implications and ways of remaining compliant - whether that is by moving to a fully decentralized system or through a different set-up.\n* With the creation of Cooler Loans there is now an economically viable way of adopting the Liquity model for the protocol - something that used to be the main blocking point for adopting decentralized front-ends and attracting third parties.\n\n\n# **Proposed set-up**\n\nAt a high level, this proposal argues for a [Liquity-like model](https://www.liquity.org/frontend) that separates the main Olympus website from the front-ends that interact with smart contracts. The former would become an information hub for the protocol hosting landing pages, dashboards, (technical) docs as well as the forum, while the latter would be hosted by third parties that are incentivized through protocol revenue streams. More specifically:\n\n\n## **1) Main Olympus website**\n\nThe current Olympus DAO website would be converted into an information portal (landing pages, dashboard, docs, forum, et cetera) and would list and link to third party, independently hosted front-ends for all smart contract interactions.\n\nThis list of front-ends is a curated selection. The criteria to be included in this list should focus on ensuring all contract interactions are possible (staking, cooler loans, OCG, bridging, RBS) and that the team hosting the front-end seems trustworthy (some level of DD needed).\n\nAt the same time, a system of automated (continuous/regular) checks would need to be adopted to ensure that these front-ends link to the correct contracts to prevent malicious actors from stealing user funds. There is a potential solution in place for a system like this.\n\nOne thing to note here is that this system will inevitably place an additional burden on users and the community in vetting and promoting certain front-ends. While some due diligence can be done and while automated checks should prevent obvious attacks, in the end users will be responsible for selecting which front-ends to use to interact with the smart contracts.\n\nThe hosting of the new Olympus website (without any smart contract interactions), the curation of the list, and the ongoing automated tests of front-ends should be managed with a small, ongoing maintenance budget that will need to be adopted post OCG deployment.\n\n\n## **2) Decentralized front-ends**\n\nIndependently hosted front-ends that allow for smart contract interactions will be incentivized with two protocol revenue streams:\n\nReferral fee on the bond contracts\n\nIf a user purchases a bond through a certain front-end, that front-end would receive a small kickback. This feature is already built into the current [Bond Protocol contracts](https://dev.bondprotocol.finance/smart-contracts/bond-system/teller/base-teller#referrerfees) but hasn’t been used so far. Note that wall swaps don’t have this fee, since it’s a different set of contracts.\n\nCooler Loan fees\n\nEither\n\n\n\n1. a portion of the interest paid by Cooler Loan borrowers at 0.5% p.a., equivalent to 0.167% per loan term; or\n2. a portion of the liquidation incentives arising from Cooler Loan defaults. In the current set-up, a user borrows at 95% LTV and when a default happens the remaining 5% is used for an auction to liquidate the user’s position and subsequently burn the remainder of the collateral. With this proposal, the LTV% would stay the same but rather than allocating 5% for the liquidation auction only 4.84135% would be used for that. The remainder, 0.15865%, would be forwarded to the front-end from which the loan originated. \\\nThis way the incentives for the front-end operator are completely aligned in each scenario: per loan term they either receive 0.167% of the borrowed amount in DAI in case the user repays/extends their loan, or 0.15865% (0.167% * 95% LTV) of the collateral amount in gOHM.\n\nA second core component of the system would be the kickback rate that operators set for their front-end. Rather than allocating the full amount of paid interest or part of the liquidation incentives to FE operators, the kickback rate allows them to compete on total costs and incentivizes operators to lower costs over time as the total number of front-ends increases.\n\nThis kickback rate determines the amount of interest/liquidation incentives that are kept by the operator vs. forwarded to the protocol treasury and/or burned. For example, a kickback rate of 25% would indicate that 75% of the 0.167% interest payment/0.15865% of the liquidation incentive is kept by the front-end operator and the rest sent to the treasury or burned.\n\nThe kickback rate can range from 0% (the full amount is kept by the FE operator) to 80% (20% is kept by the FE operator). One lesson from Liquity’s experience is that there is a race to the bottom in terms of fees and so a minimum earnings level should be created through this mechanism. This ensures that multiple operators will be able host a front-end for the long-term, improving censorship resistance.\n\nFor reference, most operators for Liquity have a kickback rate of >99%. However, one key difference between Liquity’s model and the above is that the user is directly impacted by the kickback rate when interacting with Liquity’s contracts, whereas for Olympus a higher kickback rate would benefit the treasury and all holders. So the incentive to lower fees over time might be less pronounced than what Liquity experienced.\n\nFee distribution\n\nIn today’s situation, without any active bond markets, the total, maximum amount of yearly earnings that could be distributed to front-end operators would be:\n\n\n\n1. Bond referral/kickback fee: $0\n2. Either Cooler Loan interest _or_ Cooler Loan liquidation incentives: $420,000 $84m * 0.5% interest = $420,000 p.a.^\n\nThese incentives should be more than enough to attract multiple front-end operators as well as to incentivize them to increase the kickback rate to >0%, reducing the overall cost of the decentralized set-up.\n\n\n# **Implementation**\n\nUpon governance approval, this OIP should be implemented post OCG deployment. This will ensure that all of the key elements of an Olympus decentralized front-end (RBS, Cooler Loans, Bridging, Staking, and Voting) are live and that front-end operators don’t have to update their set-up to include OCG at a later stage.\n\nIn terms of changes to existing contracts, this OIP will require a redeployment of the Cooler clearinghouse contracts to include referral fees to front-end operators as well as the kickback rate mechanism.\n\nFinally, a front-end SDK should be created that contains all the necessary information and elements to create a new Olympus front-end. This way, the barriers of entry are lowered and FE operators should be able to easily use this package to deploy new instances of the front-end.\n\nWe encourage interested parties that want to host a decentralized front-end to reach out and get in touch to discuss the possibilities and get feedback on these ideas.",

      "content": "**Background:** The Treasury team has largely finished consolidating Olympus' Treasury to DAI, as mandated by TAP-28\\. This proposal has been created to ratify the protocol's backing, which defines the fixed Cooler loan amount and RBS target price. **This proposal process is being expedited to accommodate the impending Cooler Loans launch.** \n\n**Proposal:** \n\n**RBS Updates** \n\nCooler Loans with unlimited capacity essentially creates a permanent wall below backing. RBS target price logic therefore should be updated to accommodate this. \n\nWhile the 30D Moving Average of price is below them, the logic for determining minimumPriceTarget should be updated to the lesser of the following: \n\n* (Cooler Loan Amount + Backing) / (2 x (1 - RBScushionSpread))\n* Backing x 0.99 / (1 - RBScushionSpread) \n\nAs voted on in OIP-125, when 30D MA increases above these two calculations, we will switch to using 30D MA as price target. Further, as voted on in TAP-28, a 10% cushion spread will be used for the calculations in the next section. \n\nMore context and comments can be found in the RFC for this point: [https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3594-rfc-change-rbs-minimumpricetarget-logic-to-accommodate-cooler-loans](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3594-rfc-change-rbs-minimumpricetarget-logic-to-accommodate-cooler-loans__;!!Dl6pPzL6!e28LCtjT91krJp3hmvfQUd3ztt35CDH_bNLjxzp3veQKi-alq9k6T_dkX7IBO_-OWWGx_OOewJjuRsoZGS5qoQoExocSPmvpGdmm$) \n\n**Backing** \n\nAlongside the updated RBS logic, DAO working group proposes to choose one of the two following figures to use for Cooler Loans and Range Bound Stability module. Option A is to use the assets and supply calculations found on the Olympus dashboard subgraph. Option B is to also take the Redacted swap, which will occur after Cooler launches, into account now. \n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xXrmXR07EBOgveZNIk_GiXFKMB8_2tVNoEoWJBXLXh0a8Ct5lFQiRYaFxXuYLUvRj98QBdVBuMmTISLF-UfEGUSJZnkgx7Zdcv0DemJ-tW94aN2DFrklJHP0UST0IQyT_Sx-qIUpP75ZwvmLlKg6thI) \n\nThe gOHM to be received from Redacted makes the difference in assets vs outstanding gOHM supply. It's a conservative, safe accounting practice to not pull this amount forward before physically receiving it. While we won't see an update in the dashboard until the swap is complete, it is reasonable to pull this forward. The final swap with Redacted should be made shortly after Cooler goes live. \n\nUltimately, the community should agree on the preferred accounting practice for the first round of Cooler Loans. Note that before the second round of Cooler, the working group will release a comprehensive accounting framework for ratification, which should provide a clear set of guidelines for valuing any remaining non-DAI assets in the Treasury to be used for any future clearinghouse deployments. \n\nFinally, excluding emergencies, we propose a moratorium on additional clearinghouses with different parameters for the first 4 months after the first Cooler Loan Clearinghouse launches. \n\n**Next Steps:** \n\n1. Move this OIP to Snapshot: **20 September** - DONE\n2. Snapshot concludes: **21 September**\n3. Cooler Loans launched and RBS price target updated: **21 September, subject to delay if this OIP is not ratified or if final audit requires contract rework**",

      "content": "*Note: this TAP was updated from the forum to $3mm total liquidity (1.5mm in ETH and 1.5mm in OHM) based on full alignment to change on the forum.*\n\n## Summary:\n\nRequest for community approval to create a new, full range, OHM/ETH Univ3 Liquidity Pool.\n\n### Motivation:\n\nIn an effort to support an automated, full range of minimum viable liquidity with sufficient depth inside an AMM, Olympus DAO wishes to create a new OHM/ETH Univ3 Liquidity Pool on Mainnet.  Originally, Olympus pivoted to Balancer in hopes of utilizing their TWAMM to integrate reserves into the Balancer LP's as a function of RBS. This feature has not materialized.  As such, evidence shows that our liquidity would be better placed within Uniswap v3 and with exposure to the Uniswap Universal Router.\n\nThe proposed pairing makeup was derived by looking at the year to date volume over different pair types as well as wanting to ensure that OHM maintains permanent POL on the Ethereum Network.  Though we will be backed by stables, we feel it is important, from a liquidity and routing perspective, to remain attached to Ethereum. Also, ETH is the only pairing that can be truly permanent and moves towards our future, autonomous direction. With Univ4 launching, we will explore if there is value in extending to a Hook Enabled v4 LP but, this will be managed through separate governance on an as needed basis. Lastly, post Cooler, there will only be 5% of the Treasury unspoken for so, POL must fit within this boundary.\n\nAs such, a recommendation is to make this pool a depth of $3m (1.5m OHM / 1.5m ETH) which is <= (~50% of Treasuries remaining Non-Cooler valuation).\n\nAbove and beyond this, the market provides concentrated third party liquidity which is where most of the OHM volume is transacted today.  This pool would then represent permanent liquidity below the concentrated positions. RBS Lower Cushion and Wall would then be one final level of liquidity available to the market.  The composite of these three will ensure that OHM meets its commitment to always be deeply liquid.\n\n##### Empirical Data Sources Supporting the thesis:\n\n[gOHM and OHM Univ3 Pools with over $1000 in Weekly Volume](https://dune.com/spoysp/gohm-and-ohm-univ3-pools-with-over-dollar1000-weekly-volume)\n\n[OHM LP Metrics](https://dune.com/spoysp/ohm-lp-metrics)\n\nAs Chainlink primarily uses OHMv2/ETH liquidity on Balancer as our oracle, we would work with them to move this to the new OHM/ETH Univ3 pool.\n\nFurthermore, Olympus Engineering and the OCA (On-Chain Accounting) team has devised a way to wrap the Univ3 LP NFT as an ERC20, allowing it to be managed through OCG in the future.  POL on Uniswap v3 also guarantees an on-chain price oracle via the v3 TWAP functionality.  This adds oracle optionality and allows for integration with protocols that don't use Chainlink.\n\nUpon completion of this migration, the OHM/DAI and OHM/ETH Pools on Balancer will be unwound.  The ETH will be swapped for DAI and all DAI will be moved to the DSR for use in Cooler.",

      "title": "OIP-147: Towards a Fully Autonomous Olympus",
      "content": "## **Summary**\n\n**As a result of the successful passing of TAP-28, the DAO proposes accelerating the automation of Olympus, as well as making necessary adjustments to the**[ 2023 projects](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/2195-2023-dao-projects)** and current operations, in order to facilitate the successful launch of Cooler Loans, as well as to further decentralize and automate protocol operations.**\n\n\n## **Motivation**\n\n**As stated in the**[ Cooler Loans RFC](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3200-launch-an-operator-free-cooler-loan-clearinghouse/)** and related proposals, a key motivating factor for the implementation of Cooler Loans is to optimize for the protection of network value and privatize the risk and reward associated with asset deployment activities. This strategic decision is prompted by the recognition of external macroeconomic forces beyond the community’s control, reinforcing the need to proactively safeguard against potential risks.**\n\n**While Cooler Loans will effectively simplify and de-risk the treasury to a degree, there is still a need to mitigate or minimize the operational, regulatory, and smart contract risks associated with the protocol. It is the DAO’s opinion that given Cooler and the above stated goals, the best path forward is full protocol automation and autonomy, coupled with the implementation of on-chain governance, allowing anyone to propose code upgrades and build on top of Olympus. We believe that since the protocol is already on this path of minimizing treasury risk, only by doing the same for all associated risks will we put OHM in the best position to achieve its vision of becoming a reserve currency.**\n\n**With this proposal, the DAO aims to lay out the vision and present a 6-month path to achieve above-mentioned protocol automation and autonomy. It also aims to align existing projects and products with this vision and the realities of what is feasible and advantageous in a post-Cooler world, as well as provide clarity to the broader community and partners.**\n\n\n## **The Same Vision on a Different Timeline**\n\n**Since its inception, the vision for OHM has been that of a decentralized, automated and fully autonomous reserve currency. The job of the DAO (community and contributors) has always been to build out the necessary infrastructure to make this a reality. Over the past nearly two and a half years, we’ve all been doing exactly that, constantly developing the codebase, ecosystem, and protocol mechanics.**\n\n**With the successful passing of the Cooler Loans proposal, we’ve made an important step towards automating the protocol, by automating the treasury, a historically very manual and cumbersome process. Now, we think that it’s a good time to use this momentum and push for full protocol automation and autonomy within the next 6 months.**\n\n**By the end of January 2024, the goal is for the protocol to require little to no human intervention to function properly. With the introduction of on-chain governance, anyone will be able to propose code upgrades, assemble their own dev team and even request a bounty if needed to build something out. There will not be a need for a persistent working DAO, which greatly simplifies protocol operations and reduces costs, as well as risks. This would require more broader community engagement than today, but we believe that by simplifying and de-risking the protocol, as well as removing the working DAO, we empower the community to get excited about OHM again and take matters into their own hands.**\n\n\n## **Parthenon - OlympusDAO’s On-Chain Governance**\n\n**Parthenon, our on-chain governance system, will have its own proposal detailing the mechanics and asking for permission to launch, but the DAO would like to give a brief overview here, so the community knows what to expect. The implementation details here are still subject to change.**\n\n**Transitioning from current OIP/Snapshot/Multisig execution flow to a custom on-chain governance system is paramount for the post-Cooler world. Current governance flows are sub-optimal and heavily rely on human intervention to carry out proposals with a passing vote. In an on-chain governed environment this responsibility, and liability, is removed in favor of voting on completed code that is execution ready.**\n\n**While there will always be a human element surrounding gathering awareness to gain consensus, the actual submission of a proposal, ability to vote on a proposal, and execution of said proposal, should be automated through a cohesive and secure system.**\n\n**Currently available “off the shelf” governance systems would require customization and have been found to add risk to the system as opposed to the proposed system that is specifically tailored to Default Framework.**\n\n**Parthenon is a governance system built with risk-minimization features specifically to be Cooler-compatible. In particular, upon launch, governance is in a “dormant state”: governance functions, such as proposal submissions and voting, are effectively turned off. In order to activate the governance system, a certain threshold of total supply needs to be deposited into the voting contract.**\n\n**This feature is important when migrating to on-chain governance when considering the recent “negligence attacks” in Tornado Cash and others’ governance. In a post-Cooler world, it’s possible that a significant portion of the protocol’s economic interest may not be proactively monitoring the governance system for malicious proposals. As such, it’s important that the on-chain governance system should only function when there is enough signaled interest to participate.**\n\n**In addition, Cooler Loans interest and defaults revenue would be directed to this voting contract. We believe this mechanic introduces an incentive for holding OHM as an effective counter balance to Cooler Loans. By aligning Cooler income with network security, the protocol creates tradeoffs that more accurately signal community engagement and interest in ongoing protocol development.**\n\n**We understand that Parthenon presents a big change to how the protocol is governed and it is important for the community to recognize the added responsibility they take on. As such, we will prepare two additional documents to specify the upcoming proposed governance changes: an article overviewing on-chain governance systems as a whole, and documentation specifying the mechanisms of our proposed OCG system for Olympus.**\n\n\n## **The Six-Month Plan**\n\n**The timelines here will not necessarily be accurate as tasks may be moved up and down the priority list, but the deadline of January 31st should be met for the project as a whole.**\n\n**_July_**\n\n\n\n* **Cooler Loans development and testing**\n* **OCA audit, round 1**\n\n\n### **August**\n\n\n\n* **Treasury consolidation**\n* **Liquidity migration to Uniswap v3**\n* **Staking rate set to 0%**\n* **OCA development**\n* **RBS upgrade development**\n\n\n### **September**\n\n\n\n* **QA & Testing of RBS Upgrades**\n* **QA & Testing of OCA**\n* **Landing page updates**\n* **Cooler Loans audit & launch**\n\n\n### **October**\n\n\n\n* **OCA and RBS audit**\n* **QA & Testing Parthenon (OCG)**\n\n\n### **November**\n\n\n\n* **Cross-chain bridge upgrade**\n* **OCA launch**\n* **RBS upgrades launch**\n* **QA & Testing Parthenon (OCG)**\n\n\n### **December**\n\n\n\n* **QA & Testing Parthenon (OCG)**\n\n\n### **January**\n\n\n\n* **Parthenon (OCG) Launch**\n\n**We also propose that the Six-Month Plan be counted as the final pillar project for the DAO and be allocated 45% of the bonus pool for timely completion, as described in the**[ compensation framework](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1985-oip-128-budget-and-compensation-for-the-dao-in-2023/)**. As evident by the plan above, it actually consists of multiple projects, so the restriction of one project not exceeding 33% still holds.**\n\n\n## **2023 Projects List & Current Project Impacts**\n\n**Below is a list of projects the DAO has been working on. Some of them are impacted by the Cooler Loan vote passing, and the DAO deems them to be incompatible with the system post-Cooler launch. However, this does not mean these projects could not be re-launched by the community in an on-chain governance world, if circumstances change. One possible reason to re-launch some of the initiatives could be a premium developing and thus emissions being freed up. The following projects are categorized as Compatible, Incompatible, or Rescoped.**\n\n\n### **Compatible**\n\n**[Cross-chain (Mint & Burn)](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/2379-oip-136-cross-chain-native-ohm-as-bonus-project-for-2023) - Cross-chain involves a bridge using LayerZero to allow canonical OHM to be minted and burned across chains, enables cross-chain OHM, and access to L2 markets. Due to the changes to OCA scope, minor changes to the cross-chain bridge may be necessary to develop. Also, due to the fact that the bridges currently use an emergency multisig, for emergency pausing, this might change the project’s compatibility, pending further analysis. Ideally, we would not require multisigs for the protocol to function in the post-Cooler world.**\n\n**On-chain Governance - Explained in the above section.**\n\n\n### **Incompatible**\n\n**Emissions Framework & Automated Emissions Controller - The advent of cooler loans has effectively addressed the need for an Emissions Framework and Automated Emissions Controller, as the available emissions supply is drastically reduced. As a result, the sources of emissions become simplified, which diminishes the original purpose of these frameworks and controllers. In this post-cooler world, the focus will shift away from current emissions sources, leading to a discontinuation of work on the Emissions projects.**\n\n**OHM Bonds - In the context of a simplified Cooler vision, the inclusion of OHM bonds introduces complexity and associated risks. Additionally, the reduced availability of emissions limits the capacity for bonds. The decision to stop this project aims to maintain a coherent and efficient strategy within the cooler loans framework and allow for a focused implementation of initiatives that are better suited to the current circumstances and objectives.**\n\n**[Boosted Liquidity Engine / Liquidity AMO](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/2212-oip-131-boosted-liquidity-engine-as-bonus-project-for-2023) -  BLV allows the Olympus treasury to mint OHM (single-sided) directly into liquidity pair vaults against select, high quality assets. The counter-asset is provided by partners directly or from individual holders with partner incentives. The goal of BLV is to generate deep liquidity for OHM across many liquidity pairs in order to establish it as an effective medium of exchange. This is not feasible post-Cooler Loans for a few reasons:**\n\n\n\n* **Not enough fiscal space: If all of the treasury working capital (assuming $10m) is allocated as backing for BLV (ideally it should be less), then there would be a maximum of $10m in deposits into boosted liquidity vaults. Given that deposits are at $2.3m currently, there isn’t a lot of room for expansion.**\n* **Risk to backing: if there is a de-peg or considerable impermanent loss in a BLV, leading to more OHM entering circulation, future cooler loans will have a reduced capacity (treasury value same and OHM supply up = lower liquid backing / backed OHM)**\n* **OpEx: continued rollout requires engineering work (implementations for more partners, integrations with more liquidity providers) and BD (convincing partners to use BLV), which counters the motivation to achieve full autonomy.**\n\n**We therefore propose to stop onboarding new partners, leave capacity as is while Cooler is launching, and to re-evaluate as a community when OHM achieves a sufficient premium over backing.**\n\n**[Lending AMO](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/2172-oip-130-lending-amo-as-a-key-dao-project-for-2023)  - The Lending AMO is the first foray of Olympus into DeFi credit markets, with the aim for OHM to not just be a good collateral asset but to become a good _borrowable_ asset as well. More specifically, the project aims to test minting OHM directly into lending markets. This is not feasible post-Cooler Loans, for similar reasons to BLV:**\n\n\n\n* **Not enough fiscal space for general lending markets (i.e. _not_ credit account style markets): this similarly requires backing from the treasury, which is not available**\n* **Risk to backing: if a lending market is hacked, OHM can enter circulation and affect the capacity of Cooler Loans**\n\n**For these reasons we propose that the current Lending AMO contracts be deactivated and that no more new OHM is minted into lending markets. As capacity in lending markets decreases, the treasury will be able to take out existing deposits until the protocol-supplied capacity is zero.**\n\n\n### **Rescoped**\n\n**Treasury Management - Per TAP-28, the Treasury team is working to set a discrete loan value as a result of the passing vote. Thereafter, the scope of the Treasury team’s activities will be significantly reduced.**\n\n**On-chain Accounting (OCA) - As noted in other project sections, the voted-on Cooler configuration makes some products that Olympus has built incompatible with the future protocol state. OCA was designed to support some of these products, such as CDP, lending, and emissions controller with various on-chain calculations. Since these are no longer feasible, the scope of OCA can be decreased to simply what is required for the existing products to run in a more automated fashion, specifically:**\n\n\n\n1. **Deploying a generalized PRICE system, allowing the use of multiple oracle providers and simplifying codebase.**\n2. **Automating RBS management by using PRICE module and SPPLY module to calculate liquid backing per backed OHM.**\n\n**In support of simplifying OCA, we ask for community approval to aggregate out of circulation OHM that has collected in various contracts and programmatically burn it in a way that is acceptable and aligned with other contractual burning mechanisms (IE:  RBS). The most pressing contract to be addressed is OHM acquired from bonding but this action should include, but is not limited to, all contracts deployed by the Olympus Deployer or Olympus Multisig which hold Treasury-owned OHM or gOHM that are out of circulation. This should have no material impact to Liquid Backing.**\n\n**RBS 2.0 - The implementation of Range Bound Stability (RBS) v2 will be canceled as the previously planned system is not compatible with the approved Cooler parameters, and therefore is not as effective or necessary as initially intended. Instead, efforts will be refocused on automation of the current RBS system, adding asymmetric spreads and expansion of the cushion spread logic to two independent parameters: upper and lower cushions. Automating the system increases reliability and decentralization; no more “humans in the loop” will be needed to actively maintain the system. Separating the cushion spread parameter into two, one for upper and one for lower cushion, allows us to maintain the current target price logic while adhering to the lower cushion requirements of Cooler Loans. Specific changes that should be made:**\n\n\n\n1. **Integrate On-chain Accounting modules (see above) to automate**\n2. **Operator updates**\n3. **Asymmetric spreads created, with lower cushion value at 2.5% and upper cushion value at 10%**\n\n\n### **Staking**\n\n**Per**[ OIP-133](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/2253-oip-133-staking-rate-strategy)** the community voted in favor of setting the staking rate to zero after the implementation of Lending, Leverage, LP farming, and OHM Bonds. Since these products are impacted by Cooler, we propose that the staking rate be set to 0%, as staking is a source of emissions which are undesirable in the post-Cooler world.**\n\n**No migration would be needed as gOHM simply lives on with no utility besides being Cooler Loans collateral.**\n\n\n### **Liquidity**\n\n**We propose to migrate $5m of liquidity from Balancer to Uniswap v3 on mainnet, deployed in a full range. The remaining liquidity in Balancer will be withdrawn and split into reserves. We also propose to migrate the Arbitrum OHM-USDC and gOHM-WETH POL positions to Uniswap v3 on Arbitrum, deployed in a full range. Uniswap routing has proven to be far superior for OHM, so we expect to see higher utilization of the protocol liquidity on that platform. Furthermore, POL on Uniswap v3 guarantees an on-chain price oracle via the v3 TWAP functionality. This adds oracle optionality and allows for integration with protocols that don't use Chainlink.**\n\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n**The DAO is excited about these changes to the protocol, as this is a culmination of all the work done so far and something all of us have been building towards since the start. We will allow for plenty of time for discussion before moving this to an OIP and Snapshot vote, as the vision for Olympus has to be shared by both the contributors of the DAO and the broader community.**",

      "content": "Summary:\n\nSwap Olympus DAO’s BTRFLY holdings and all future vesting for $3.75mm in gOHM from Redacted DAO (“Redacted”).\n\n\nMotivation:\n\nSince its inception, Redacted and Olympus have enjoyed strong collaboration and cooperation. Over time, however, the strategic missions of the protocols have diverged. As such, in the spirit of cooperation, we believe the swap will be mutually beneficial, allowing further consolidation of the Olympus treasury while simplifying Redacted’s token vesting and token structure.\n\n\nProposed Terms:\n\ngOHM Price: $2,850\n\nTotal gOHM sent to Olympus from Redacted: 1,315.8\n\nTotal BTRFLY sent to Redacted from Olympus: 5,429.23\n\nCancellation of future Olympus vesting in Redacted\n\nMutual release of all claims against the respective DAOs, contributors, multisigs,...\n\n\nExecution:\n\nA vote in favor of this proposal supports these dependent actions of Redacted and from Olympus:\n\n1a/ Redacted DAO will terminate all future vesting of BTRFLY to Olympus DAO immediately upon proposal passing.\n\n1b/ Redacted DAO will make a payment to Olympus DAO in gOHM tokens, equal to 790 gOHM tokens at a fixed price of $2,850 USD per gOHM immediately upon proposal passing.\n\n2a/ Olympus DAO will pay Redacted DAO all the unlocked BTRFLY in its possession, equal to at least, 2629.78 BTRFLY(78.38 in wallet and 2,551.40 unlocked rlBTRFLY) immediately upon proposal passing.\n\n2b/ Redacted DAO will make a further payment to Olympus DAO in gOHM tokens, equal to 245 gOHM tokens at a fixed price of $2,850 USD per gOHM immediately upon receipt of the tokens aforementioned in (2a).\n\n3a/ Olympus DAO will send all of the unlocked BTRFLY in its possession to Redacted DAO at each subsequent payment date, with payment dates being at a minimum two Payment Dates:\n\nOn September 30, 2023 for at least 2,641 BTRFLY\n\nOn November 15, 2023 for all remaining BTRFLY\n\n3b/ Redacted DAO will make a pro rata payment to Olympus DAO of the remaining 280.8 gOHM, relative to the portion of total outstanding BTRFLY sent by Olympus DAO at each 'Payment Date' specified in 3a. These payments from Redacted DAO will occur within 3 days of Olympus DAO corresponding payments of BTRFLY.\n\nThis proposal will not go into effect unless the Redacted governance also approves of this agreement (Link).\n\nThe purpose of these mutual snapshot votes is to settle any potential disputes between Redacted and Olympus. The cancellation of the vesting for Olympus and a symmetric release of claims against Redacted is sufficient consideration for this release of claims against Olympus. Failure to complete any of the steps above will void this agreement.\n\n\nVote:\n\nFor: In favor of swap + cancel vesting\nAgainst: Against swap + cancel vesting",

      "title": "OIP-145: Bridge Loans Pre-Cooler",
      "content": "**Note: this is a time sensitive proposal. The governance timeline is compressed accordingly.**\n\n## Summary\n\nCreate a short term loan facility on Vendor V1 (on mainnet) with enough capacity to accommodate current borrowers on Rari. This gives Ohmie borrowers the opportunity to take a bridge loan between now and Cooler deployment, with better terms than what's available now. It also keeps costs in the Olympus ecosystem, instead of fees leaking to external parties.\n\n*Previous discussions related to Vendor Finance can be found here:*\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/2047-tap-21-pilot-clearing-house-deposits\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/3337-tap-26-expansion-of-vendor-finance-partnership/\n\n## Motivation\n\n*Soft landing:* It's clear that there is excess demand for borrowing that the Treasury can help fill while Cooler is being implemented. Rari borrowers can rehypothecate into a \"soft landing\" bridge loan until Cooler arrives. We propose to deposit enough DAI into the market to be able to service all gOHM collateral in Rari at a 50% LTV.\n\n*Capture revenue:* Ohmies are paying high interest on their gOHM-collateralized loans, which largely exits the ecosystem. This was a main motivator for Cooler, but we can address the value leak now with a short term Vendor market. This allows the Olympus Treasury to keep fees in the ecosystem, bringing value back to OHM holders.\n\n*Definitive backing:* Vendor markets have specific closure dates, with repayment required prior to that date. The vast majority of current gOHM-collateralized loans don't have a definite payback date, including those written by Rari. It's not certain when the Treasury could expect that money back. This makes it difficult to consider those assets as backing for Cooler loans. Using a Vendor market instead makes it possible to take those assets into account for the Cooler-mandated backing calculation.\n\n*Stay the course on consolidation:* one alternative is to put FRAX into Fraxlend. This backtracks on the current Treasury mandate to prepare for Cooler by consolidating into DAI. Vendor accepts DAI markets and allows the DAO to maintain course on asset consolidation.\n\n## Proposed terms\n- 1,000,000 DAI deposited into Vendor (bringing total DAI deposited in Vendor V1 to 1.5M)\n- 30 September 2023 expiry date\n- 3.5% annualized rate\n- 1,415 DAI lent per gOHM collateralized (~50% LTV)",

The Association is an independent non-profit organization without any commercial purpose. The main goals are to research, develop, operate, and maintain Olympus, while developing Olympus Ecosystem and defending the interests of its members.\n\n## Motivation\nThe motivation for this proposal is to continue to fund the Olympus Association so that it may execute the budget approved by the Olympus DAO community.\n\nThe Olympus Association is important for providing contributors a formal structure to coordinate work, and compensations, and establish relations with other organizations and contractors in order to fulfill the Olympus Protocol vision. The Olympus Association provides its members the necessary legal representation to increase efficiency and efficacy. Importantly, this OIP does not change or increase the overall budget. The existing budget already approved in OIP-128 applies. Each month, the monthly budget's OHM funding will enter circulating supply.\n\n## Proposal\nWe seek authorization from the Olympus DAO Community to fund working capital based on the budgeting needs of Olympus Association. The current request is for covering expenses Q3 and Q4 2023, for a total of 3,910,000 DAI in OHM. The DAO will execute monthly funding to support the Association running costs, within the approved 2023 budget.",

      "title": "TAP-28: Cooler Round 2 (Electric Boogaloo)",
      "content": "This treasury amendment proposal provides a passable, holistic Cooler loan implementation, with no necessary subordinate amendments. It will describe each step and process, to be followed verbatim unless and until a future proposal affects changes.\n\n**The only change in this post versus the RFC is an expansion of RBS radius from 7.5% to 10%. This portion is subject to removal if there is backlash, but it seems wise to ensure protocol sell-side liquidity remains at a healthy premium while loans are introduced. The radius can always be reigned back in in the future if this proves overly conservative. The rest of this post is a direct copy.**\n\n## The vote to be conducted is the following:\n- 90% consolidated backing lent per collateral token; 0.5% interest per annum\n- 95% consolidated backing lent per collateral token; 0.5% interest per annum\n- 95% consolidated backing lent per collateral token; 3.3% interest per annum\n- Back to the drawing board\n\nLoan values are referred to relative to “consolidated backing” rather than discrete values. This avoids a repeat of TAP-25, where 95% represented ~3,000 DAI per gOHM at the start of the proposal and ~2,850 at the start of the vote. A discrete loan value would be set following a passing vote and subsequent consolidation of treasury into non-volatile assets (stable coins). I suggest a mix of DAI and LUSD, based primarily on their censorship resistance and the yields they offer today (FRAX is no longer competitive relative to the DSR or stability pool at this time). Should backing per token grow in the future, an amendment proposal could pass raising the loan value; until that point, loan values would remain the same.\n\nLoan tenures are 121 days (four months) at a time. Users should understand that they can roll at any time in advance — you do not need to wait until your loan is near/at expiration to do so. The largest downside of a shorter tenure is an increase in gas expenditure, but benefits to the protocol regarding finality and interest accrual seem to make this worthwhile.\n\nClearinghouse capacity are handled via rolling top-ups to the facility. At the start of each week (the first day of the week dictated by the first day the clearinghouse is live), the clearinghouse is topped up or drawn down to hold a liquid balance of 18m DAI. If the preceding week saw more loans than repayments, a top-up would occur, adding DAI liquidity for loans. If the preceding week saw more repayments than loans, a draw-down would occur, removing DAI liquidity. Pending technical viability, any balance in excess of 3m DAI held by the clearinghouse at the start of the week will be held in the DSR. Rebalancing of the facility’s liquidity occurs in perpetuity.\n\nRBS will be retuned so that its lower cushion sits at a minimum 2% margin to loan value. This ensures against arbitrage through the clearinghouse facility. This is a minimum because RBS remains dynamic and subject to rise above its floor value. RBS radius is expanded from 7.5% to 10%.\n\nRegarding the recent Phaeton proposal, we suggest that if it proceeds, it is implemented with a separate token and a conversion of backing upon migration. Users should opt-in rather than having a conversion of all users via majority rule. In this case, Cooler does not interfere; a user moving to the all ETH protocol would repay their OHM loan and migrate. Cooler also removes opportunity cost while that proposal proceeds and protocol is developed, allowing all time needed. We view these two proposals as symbiotic in many regards, though certainly separate.\n\nThis proposal has a tentative vote date of Friday, June 30, given forum rules have been met. As with TAP-25 & TAP-27, it will run one week. Should it look likely to pass, author will enter an audit with Sherlock, fronting costs to be reimbursed upon the passage of the proposal.\n\n**To summarise the timeline of this proposal:**\n- 00:00 Tuesday, June 27 posted\n- 00:00 Saturday, July 1 to snapshot\n- Week of July 3 code into audit\n- 00:00 Saturday, July 8 snapshot concludes\n- Week of July 10 audit concludes + treasury consolidated\n- Week of July 17 code is deployed and clearinghouse is funded\n- Weeks of July 24 onward, clearinghouse is topped-up or drawn-down",

      "content": "# Summary\nIn order to support the OHM asset listing on Sentiment and to bootstrap the initial market, deploy a Sentiment Lending AMO. Considering the lower levels of liquidity on Arbitrum, and the fact that Sentiment is a relatively new protocol, this proposal caps the Lending AMO capacity to 25k OHM (deployed in tranches). As the market matures and third party capital flows into the lending market, the lending AMO capacity can be decreased over time to make room for third party depositors.\n\n# Sentiment background\nSentiment is a liquidity protocol enabling permissionless undercollateralized borrowing on Arbitrum. Through a Sentiment credit account the capital efficiency of borrowing is increased through onchain hypothecation, allowing users to leverage to a greater multiplier than with traditional lending markets and deploy these assets in (whitelisted) DeFi integrations. These include assets (such as GLP, wstETH, and - after the listing - OHM as well) as well as protocols (such as Aave, Curve, Balancer, Convex and Sushiswap).\n\nToday, Sentiment has around 29k accounts with a total of $30m in cumulative borrowed assets (see here). OHM is listed as the 7th collateral asset on the platform (besides USDC, USDT, ETH, FRAX, ARB and wBTC) which allows users to lend OHM, borrow OHM, and leverage into OHM.\n\n# Security Overview\nThe protocol has been live for over six months, has been audited by Arbitrary Execution and Sherlock, has a bug bounty programme with Immunefi and an insurance agreement with Sherlock.\n\nOne thing to note is that Sentiment suffered an exploit in the past on 4th April, 2023. The exploit led to an initial loss of $1M in user funds that were recovered within 48 hours from the incident. The root cause of the exploit was a view-only reentrancy bug in Balancer Pools exploited through the Sentiment oracle. The team successfully recovered part of the funds through onchain negotiations with the hacker and the rest of the shortfall was covered through their insurer, Sherlock.\n\nThe protocol was restored to its initial state on 10th April, 2023 and has been functioning normally ever since. A technical postmortem and incident details were released shortly after (https://twitter.com/sherlockdefi/status/1646196968845352960).\n\nFor more information on Sentiment please see here (https://docs.sentiment.xyz/).\n\n# Motivation\nFollowing OIP-127, Olympus has made the first steps into OHM lending markets. Currently, a total of 73k OHM is deployed in lending markets through this programme. A key goal of the Lending AMO project has been to promote OHM as a borrowable asset. Recently, OHM has also been approved as a new collateral asset in Gearbox in combination with a Lending AMO (OIP-140). \n\nThe benefits of introducing OHM as a borrowable asset outlined in OIP-127 still hold true. But one additional strength of a Lending AMO is that they allow for rapid bootstrapping of new markets. And so to help support the listing of OHM as an asset on Sentiment and to guarantee a minimum amount of liquidity on the platform, this OIP approves the creation of a Lending AMO for Sentiment.\n\nOver time, as the market matures and as third party capital finds its way into the OHM passive lending pool, the protocol can scale back the deployment of this AMO to make more room for third parties. Since users deposit assets single-sidedly into the passive pools, the Sentiment OHM lending pool creates an opportunity for passive OHM holders to earn yield on their assets - this is one of the first passive lending opportunities on Arbitrum.\n\nAs with the recently approved Gearbox Lending AMO, Sentiment is also a credit account style lending market that only functions with whitelisted integrations. As such, there is no risk of OHM being borrowed and used for bridging back to Mainnet and used for staking or OHM bonds, which could have a negative effect due to rate arbing. \n\nConsidering the lower levels of liquidity on Arbitrum, and the fact that Sentiment is a relatively new protocol, this proposal caps the Lending AMO capacity to 25k OHM. This would be sufficient to bootstrap the market and allow for the development of OHM use cases and yield strategies on the platform.\n\nAs with the previous lending AMOs, any OHM minted but not borrowed will not increase the circulating supply. Only after a borrower deposits collateral and borrows OHM will this be considered part of the circulating OHM supply.\n\n# Details\n- Deployment source: Sentiment OHM lending pool (Arbitrum)\n- Maximum capacity: 25k OHM, deployed in tranches\n- Method: Multisig deployment at first, to be switched over to a contract per OIP-130 (once available)",

      "content": "# Summary\nLaunch a Boosted Liquidity Vault for the LUSD/OHM pool on Balancer with a maximum vault capacity of $2.5m in LUSD. To match this, approve the minting of up to $2.5m in OHM for this vault in order for both assets to be deployed in a 50/50 liquidity pool.\n\n# Background\nThe Boosted Liquidity Vault (BLV) leverages Olympus’ competitive advantages (monetary policy flexibility and treasury strength) to mint OHM into liquidity pools with select high quality assets. LPs bring an asset (e.g., stablecoin, LSD) into newly developed vaults and the Olympus treasury mints OHM in equal value (for 50/50 pools) to match and create a complete LP position.\n\nLPs benefit from boosted liquidity mining opportunities and partner protocols are able to more efficiently drive liquidity mining programs and deepen supplemental liquidity for their tokens. Olympus benefits from LPs providing counter asset liquidity, enhancing OHM’s liquidity depth, which enables greater utility and stability. It also has the potential to unwind part of the POL and use the reserve assets in other use cases. Furthermore, the BLV can be a powerful tool for partnerships. BLV is not intended to be utilized for any and all assets but rather select high-quality assets with which an OHM pairing would be beneficial.\n\nThe first BLV was launched in cooperation with Lido (wstETH/OHM) and has seen good traction, reaching an LP size of >$3m with an incentivization rate of ~10% for depositors.\n\n# Vault Details\nThe LUSD/OHM vault will be the second deployment of a BLV. As third parties add LUSD into the vault, the protocol will mint OHM to match this and deploy it into the liquidity pool and stake it to receive incentives.\n\nThese incentives will be in the form of BAL and AURA rewards and both Liquity and Olympus will vote with vlAURA to direct rewards to the pool. The expectation is that this pool will see significant arbitrage volume between other LUSD pools (where LUSD is frequently trading over peg) and the existing deep OHM pools against DAI and ETH.\n\nAll the reward tokens earned through this vault will be directed to LUSD depositors. The protocol itself will not receive these tokens, with the exception of trading fees which are accrued inside the LP token itself. The target APY range of the vault is 5%-10%.\n\n**The proposed vault will launch with the following parameters:**\n- Maximum capacity: $2.5m in LUSD provided by third parties & $2.5m in OHM minted by the protocol.\n- Pool: 50/50 LUSD/OHM on Balancer\n- Incentivization strategy: Aura staking\n- Oracle: Chainlink\n- Fee: 5%\n\nNote that the maximum mint capacity is perpetual and can be utilized by the contracts until the vault closes and/or a governance vote changes these parameters.",

      "content": "# Summary\nTo support the cross-chain growth of OHM liquidity and, by extension, new use cases, establish an ongoing incentives budget that can be used to experiment with incentivizing liquidity on the various DEXes and staking layers on Arbitrum. This budget will be capped at $50k/week.\n\n# Background\nTAP-15 permitted Olympus DAO to explore the use of Hidden Hand incentives as a means to boost voting power to its LP Gauges. TAP-23 formalized this approach, increased the allocated budget, and extended these incentives to multiple Aura and Balancer markets.\n\nThe results so far have been favorable, and Olympus has seen several million in TVL added across its incentivized pools.  On average, Treasury has seen around a 5-15% return, with margin largely being impacted by the decrease in BAL and AURA prices. Even still, incentives have proven an effective means to accumulate liquidity in a cost effective way. \n\n# Motivation\nOn Mainnet, the liquidity incentives are both good to attract liquidity as well as to increase the protocol’s voting power (by accruing more strategic assets). On Arbitrum, the considerations are slightly different. \n\nPerhaps most importantly, Arbitrum POL is not as deep as mainnet since the protocol needs very deep liquidity on Mainnet in order to run RBS, whereas on Arbitrum this is not a direct concern. The protocol will not be able to offer the same level of deep liquidity on all chains without reducing POL on mainnet. A way around this is for the protocol to offer a guaranteed base layer of liquidity through POL and extend that with third party liquidity, which is created either through incentives, voting power, or more novel solutions like the recently launched BLV.\n\nIt’s important to note that as more OHM finds its way to Arbitrum and as the number of integrations and use cases expand, there will be a need for more liquidity to, for example, support effective liquidations in lending markets. \n\n\n# Proposal\nAs such, the Treasury Team requests community approval to create a budget specifically to experiment with liquidity incentives on Arbitrum and to support the creation of more third party OHM liquidity. This budget will be capped at $50k/week. Initially, it is likely that only a fraction of the budget will be tapped. \n\nConsidering the number and variety of DEXes and staking layers on Arbitrum this TAP is not limited to selected venues, but instead offers the flexibility to experiment with various platforms in order to find the most optimal solution to create third party OHM liquidity.\n\n**The list of potential assets used to incentivize will include:**\n- OHM\n- USDC\n- DAI\n- FRAX\n- ARB (Preferred)\n\nOHM utilized will either come from OHM already owned by the Treasury or minted specifically for this purpose. \n",

Borrowers on the platform open isolated credit accounts, which hold both the user funds and the borrowed funds. These funds are deployed into whitelisted integrations such as Curve, Convex, Balancer, Lido and Yearn. \n\nToday, Gearbox has around $90m in TVL and $56m in borrowed funds across the current pools (DAI, USDC, FRAX, WETH, WBTC, wstETH). \n\nThe protocol has been live for over a year, has been audited multiple times, and has an ongoing bug bounty programme with Immunefi. The current protocol iteration (v2) has been audited by ChainSecurity, Consensys Diligence, and Sigma Prime. \n\nFor more information on Gearbox please see here: https://docs.gearbox.finance/\n\n# Motivation\nFollowing OIP-127, Olympus has made the first steps into OHM lending markets.

In support of this, pools of liquidity must be established and funded to create a low friction base to build from. Olympus DAO has evaluated the existing landscape and prepared recommendations on how to most effectively position our assets on-chain to support this effort.\n\n# Proposal:\nRequest community approval to establish the following:\n- Initial POL: Initial Pools will be seeded in amounts not to exceed, 5mm each.\n- Pool Types: Two pools will be created - OHM/USDC and OHM/wETH\n- Pool Locations: Balancer (Though discussions and terms with alternative DEX’s are ongoing. Balancer allows us continued exposure to AURA where we have been accumulating governance power).\n\n## Notes:\nUSDC was selected as the stable pairing asset after evaluating the volumes on Arbitrum One. DAI volume was too low to have it act as a core liquidity pair. There has also been exploration into a potential 3Pool using LUSD in the future. As our presence matures, iterations can strategically be made through discrete OIP’s.\n\nAssets used to assemble this LP will be extracted from existing LP on Mainnet. As of the time of writing, 10m OHM/wETH has been unwrapped, the ETH from which will be used to create the wETH Position. FRAXBP will be unwrapped to create FRAX which will be swapped for the USDC position. Furthermore, creating this liquidity will require a bridging event to occur to get the Non-OHM assets on to the Arbitrum One chain. As of the time of writing, we have roughly $934k of wETH already on chain so the difference will be bridged using a high quality protocol to move assets of size. The USDC will will be bridged as well\n\nOHM will be transferred (Mint and Burned) via the the newly deployed custom Cross Chain v3 Contracts an then LP will be assembled from these assets.",

      "title": "OIP-137: Treasury Framework",
      "content": "Summary\nThis OIP establishes a new framework for the DAO’s treasury, covering the following categories:\n\nGuiding policy\nTarget treasury composition\nAsset allocation process\nStrategic Assets\nThe DAO should reevaluate the framework from time to time, accounting for evolution of the protocol and changes in the market.\n\nGuiding Policy\nThe Olympus treasury is at the very core of the protocol and the DAO and, combined with novel monetary policy, makes OHM unique. The long-term sustainable management of the treasury is essential to OHM’s success. Yet, we must also recognize OHM’s growth will be driven to a far greater extent by true demand and utility rather than treasury management alone. Our strategy will reflect this reality by focusing on conservative deployment as opposed to active and aggressive investments. Furthermore, it will be consistent with Olympus’ ethos of decentralization, favoring organic third party proposals and scalability to ensure the framework is compatible with an on-chained governed future. The treasury team may devise and propose strategies but ultimately intends to spend more time shepherding and vetting proposals from the community, DAOS and service providers.\n\nTarget Treasury Composition Recommendations\nAsset Mix:\nThe treasury is currently composed of approximately 79% stable assets and 21% volatile assets. The RFC preceding this proposal recommended an increase in volatile exposure to 25%, providing Olympus with a stable base for open market operations (RBS) while maintaining sufficient market correlation and upside. The vast majority of comments to the RFC were focused on this ratio, with most recommending or requesting a more aggressive shift toward ETH and other volatile assets. However, given the current state of the protocol and nature of RBS, the Treasury team maintains the 75%/25% recommendation. Still, especially in light of the USDC depeg, the Treasury team recognizes need for Olympus to decrease reliance on stablecoins with centralized backing. Increasing ETH exposure marginally is one step in that direction while not undermining the relative stability of OHM’s backing in the near term. The other step is increasing exposure to purely decentralized stablecoins. The Olympus Treasury has generally limited this exposure to 5% of respective supplies. In order to facilitate further decentralization, the team recommends increasing the cap for LUSD to 10% while maintaining a hard cap of 5% for its counterparts with centralized backing. These two steps together will reduce exposure to centralized stablecoins by more than 10% or approximately $25 million as of this writing.\n\nLooking forward, as Olympus matures, garners more adoption and as evolved versions of RBS are deployed, the DAO should reevaluate these ratios to determine whether it is feasible to increase decentralized exposure. This may include increasing ETH exposure or introducing more purely decentralized stablecoins as they become available. The Treasury team recommends this reevaluation be done every six months.\n\nIn terms of execution of the 75%/25% split, the transition should be complete within 60 days of the passing of this OIP. LUSD exposure will be increased opportunistically, as it approaches parity with DAI/FRAX/etc.\n\nRebalancing:\nThe target weights should behave more like bands, rebalancing when weights deviate more than certain thresholds from targets. The Treasury team recommends rebalancing bands for volatile assets between 20% and 35%. Custom strategies, including improvements to RBS, may be created to automatically rebalance and a dashboard will be created to empirically monitor and measure positions against their target weights.\n\nProtocol Owned Liquidity Mix:\nThe Treasury Team recommends rebalancing the OHM/DAI and OHM/ETH pool sizes to better match broader treasury target ratios. As of this writing, there is approximately $16 million DAI and $20 million ETH deployed in POL pools. While the treasury team recognizes the importance of the pool, it recommends reducing the OHM/ETH pool by $10M (and possibly increasing the OHM/DAI pool) to mitigate IL and to increase capital available for LSD or other ETH opportunities. ETH liquidity may be supplemented with BLE vaults and/or other third party liquidity.\n\nMaximum Protocol Exposure:\nLimit exposure to any protocol / project to 60% of the treasury. For reference, DAI accounts for 50% as of this writing. This would still apply to protocols with multiple products – e.g., exposure to FRAX and frxETH would cumulatively be limited to 60%.\n\nAsset Duration:\nLimit deployments into illiquid venues to 7.5% of the Treasury. For purposes of the ultimate proposal, illiquid is defined as a maturity or lock-up greater than 4 months. In no event shall the treasury deploy into assets with maturity or lock-up greater than 1 year, with the exception of select strategic assets acquired via DAO swap or other similar arrangements, which today include FXS and JONES.\n\nAsset Deployment Process\nBaseline Deployments:\nThe treasury team will recommend baseline strategies for each asset or group of assets. Baseline strategies should carry little to no incremental risk over holding the underlying asset. Yields on base strategies should serve as a hurdle rate for other opportunities for the DAO to evaluate.\n\nThrough past OIPs, baseline strategies have emerged as follows:\n\nDAI: DAI Savings Rate Staking\n\nFRAX: FRAX-USDC base pool on Convex\n\nLUSD: Stability Pool\n\nThere is no baseline strategy for ETH today. The treasury team recommends deployment of ETH into liquid staking derivatives or similar products.\n\nAsset Deployment Applications:\nIt is our hope that the treasury team spends most time not writing proposals, but rather vetting and shepherding deployment proposals from others. The ETH baseline strategy should serve as a great test case, as we invite proposals from the community, LSD protocols and other stakeholders to engage. With respect to other assets, we expect the baseline strategies to cover the majority of holdings but that leaves ample room for other deployment opportunities. The treasury team has developed an objective intake and vetting process, and will work with initial applicants to iterate and establish best practices. Applications should be consistent with the treasury guiding policy, prioritizing security and decentralized processes above chasing highest returns. Applications will be evaluated along the following criteria:\n\nProtocol history\nStrategy risk\nSmart contract risk (including audit history and oracle reliance)\nProtocol governance\nExpected returns\nStrategic benefits\nToday, treasury deployments are done through a custom system of allocator contracts that interact with the treasury. In the future, we intend to develop an “allocator SDK” allowing third party proposals to come complete with an allocator that can plug into Olympus architecture paving the way for a decentralized treasury management system that is compatible with on-chain governance.\n\nProtocols, service providers and others who are interested in making a proposal to the community can reach out here.\n\nStrategic Assets\nThe treasury team will recommend target levels of strategic assets for governance purposes. Once achieved, additional rewards will be sold into stablecoins or ETH depending on the current ratio. With respect to voting, the treasury team will make intentions clear for each asset, providing certainty to the market for a given period of time.",

      "title": "OIP-136: Cross-chain native OHM as bonus project for 2023",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nDesignate the “Cross-chain Native OHM” as a pillar project to be included in the bonus program as described in OIP-128.\n\n## Motivation\n\nOIP-45 (Proteus) demonstrated demand for cross-chain gOHM. Since then, the DAO embarked (and successfully) shipped a major refactoring to the codebase (Olympus V3). In addition, new developments in bridging technology (LayerZero) have opened the opportunity for native OHM on other chains. The DAO is now ready to take advantage of these developments to launch cross-chain native OHM.\n\nCross-chain native OHM benefits Ohmies. Many Ohmies are priced out of participating in the burgeoning Olympus economy on mainnet. By going cross-chain, we give them the ability to participate in the econohmy at the fraction of mainnet costs.\n\nCross-chain native OHM benefits the protocol. It is well-known that liquidity is thinner on L2s. Olympus is in a unique position to expand its liquidity infrastructure services to L2s both by minting OHM and offering incentives to key partners. In addition, the protocol will satisfy demand for OHM liquidity from partners.\n\n## Project scope\n\nThe project makes use of LayerZero technology to mint/burn native OHM. The technology has been audited multiple times and is generally trusted by the broader crypto industry. It is not without risks, however, and we encourage everyone to do their own due diligence before bridging. Our contracts have been reviewed by LayerZero Integration Team and we’ll be doing an official audit with OtterSec (a trusted partner of LayerZero).\n\nInitial rollout will be on Arbitrum and Optimism L2. The chains were selected based on data from Proteus, community feedback and partnership demand. We intend to expand to other chains in the near future and will be evaluating new chains according to demand from the community, strategic importance, partnership demand and security.\n\n## Timeline\n\nThe timeline for development and go-to market is as follows: \n\n- Smart contract development (Arbitrum and Optimism contracts to mint/burn OHM) - completed\n- Audit - went into audit last week\n- Frontend (updating existing bridge UI) - todo\n- Audit Remediation - todo\n- QA - todo\n- Go-to Market - in progress\n\n- **Launch - ETA May 1st**\n\nPost-launch - ongoing partnerships and GTM campaigns to drive cross-chain engagement\n\nAs part of GTM, our partnerships team is reaching out to existing cross-chain partners to discuss gOHM. We will NOT be deprecating gOHM on other chains in the near term; you do not have to do anything at this moment. Any major changes to gOHM liquidity or existing partnerships will be communicated ahead of time and with plenty of time. Our goal is transition all holders to OHM without sacrificing trust of the community.\n\n## Bonus\n\nThe bonus allocated for the successful and timely completion of this project is 20% of the total bonus pool.",

(Visualization can be seen here: Visualization of Proposed Structure https://imgur.io/cUBC2Tv?r)\n\n## Background:\nWhen the Olympus Protocol was launched, a set of Gnosis Safes was created to:\n\n- Own the Smart Contracts\n- Hold Treasury Assets in Main Net\n- Hold Working Capital for the DAO\n- Manage Policy Parameters\n- Hold Assets in other chains\n\nThe main multisig (hitherto known as the “DAO Multisig”) (0x245cc372C84B3645Bf0Ffe6538620B04a217988B) was established to be the Governor and manage the treasury so as to provide decentralized protection of its assets.  \n\nAdditionally, OHM from each reserve bond sold was allocated to the DAO Multisig, providing an operational runway for DAO Operations  Protocol-Owned assets have predominantly remained in the treasury contracts along with a network of allocators (Proxy Contracts) that enable deployments into other protocols. From time to time, treasury assets have also been migrated to the DAO Multisig, which acts as both a clearinghouse and temporary allocator as defined by smart contract logic.  As a result, the DAO Multisig contains both treasury assets and OHM controlled by the DAO for working capital. The DAO has worked to ensure that these two groups of assets are treated as distinct ledgers so as not to commingle DAO Funds and Treasury Funds.\n\n## Proposal:\nThe Treasury Team proposes that funds be formally segmented into discrete Multisigs such that the on-chain data creates transparent and separate ledgers for each purpose:\n\n- **Protocol Treasury**\n- **DAO Working Capital**\n\nSigning authority for each of the new Multisig will remain 4/8 and drawn from the same pool of signers that exist today.  Mechanically, this will just create a hard fork of our books on-chain.\n\nThe Treasury Team also recommends the following recharacterizations\n\n**Changes in Nomenclature:**\n0xa8687a15d4be32cc8f0a8a7b9704a4c3993d9613 - TRSRY\n\n0x245cc372c84b3645bf0ffe6538620b04a217988b - Treasury Multisig\n\n0xF65A665D650B5De224F46D729e2bD0885EeA9dA5 - DAO Working Capital \n\nTransfer / Designation of Assets:\nOHM: 1,558,460.06\nFrom: 0x988b\nTo: 0x9dA5\nReason: DAO Liquid Working Capital\n\ngOHM: 4.990\nFrom: 0xad4c\nTo: 0x9dA5\nReason: DAO Owned gOHM in Aribtrum Allocator\n\ngOHM: 700.51\nFrom: 0xad4c\nTo: N/A\nReason: gOHM Side of wETH/gOHM Sushi LP is designated as DAO Owned OHM\n\nOHM: 14,859.10\nFrom: 0x988b\nTo: N/A\nReason: OHM Side of OHM/FRAXBP LP in Convex is designated as DAO Owned OHM\n\nOHM: 8,208.1487\nFrom: 0x1e16\nTo: 0x9dA5\nReason: DAO Owned OHM from Original Bond Contract\n\nOHM: 42,733.98\nFrom: 0x2ee6\nTo: N/A\nReason: Capital for DAO Funded Grants\n\nOHM: 12,092.81\nFrom: 0x901a\nTo: N/A\nReason: Capital for DAO Funded Grants FTE Comp\n\nOn 3/2/23, with OOP-1 after governance passed, 200,971 OHM was transferred to the Olympus Association to fund Q2 FY23 Compensation.\n\nIn total, at time of writing, this defines the DAO Working Capital as 2,000,451 OHM.\n\nGoing forward, assets will continue to remain separated.

      "content": "Summary\n\nThis OIP seeks authority from the community continue the Grants Program, whilst making adjustments to operations, namely:\n\n    Do not allocate more funds to the program at this time\n\n    Fold the Grants Program into Partnerships, and dissolve the committee in favor of partnership team review with council’s ability to veto\n\n    Cadence for community OIP and review to move from 3 month cycle to when additional funding would be requested\n\n    Transfer existing grants funds (~$500k of gOHM) from previous grants OIPs (55, 90, 108) to the Olympus Association which will become the entity granting funds on behalf of the DAO (though still administered by the Grants Working Group)\n\nAccelerating OHM’s Use as a Unit of Account\nIt’s been one year since the Olympus community approved the creation of the Grants Program in OIP-55 (forum, snapshot). OIP-55 stipulated that the grant program be run for a trial period of 3.3 months. The program was then renewed by community governance as part of OIP-90 (forum, snapshot) and OIP-108 (forum, snapshot).\n\nThe Grants Program aimed to benefit Olympus and OHM by helping to support aligned protocols that drive OHM’s core mission of becoming Web3’s reserve currency and supporting key Olympus12 goals.\n\nAt this time it is the recommendation of the Grants Working Group that merging efforts with the Partnerships team would be the most effective use of resources to achieve further adoption of OHM use as a Unit of Account and expand OHM’s utility throughout DeFi. The high level success came from internal referrals, so reducing the current time spent on intake given the macro environment is the recommended course of action.\n\nGrantee Achievement Highlights\n\nHere are a few highlights Grants has enabled within the econOHMy since our public launch on 14th February 2022:\n\n    Total of 37,536.5 OHM (worth 629,447 USD at time of sending, current value of 375,365 USD) awarded across 20 grants.\n\n    High level successes:\n\n        Education\n\n        Artemis\n\n        Of 17 students trained, 2 have built on OHM with a total of 13 capstone projects done in the two bootcamps, from which 6 are being developed as real products to deploy on mainnet\n\n        Olympus Scholars Program\n\n        Asfi of WAGMI Labs says: “Our goal was to make interactive educational content that delivers comprehensible input in a low anxiety environment. A grant from Olympus helped us deliver on that and community feedback (big shout out to Relwyn) helped us improve our prototype a lot. We have signed on two more customers since then. Thank you Ohmies!”\n\n        Utility\n\n        MoverDAO\n\n        A non-custodial debit card that allows you to spend gOHM via MoverDAO (yes you are reading that correctly - now known as HolyHeld).\n\n        On the way to delivering an Olympus mobile payments App (think OHM Venmo). Majin never needing to leave OHM!\n\n        Infra\n\n        Playgrounds\n\n        Empowering users with on-chain data analytics tools which will help drive utility and adoption for Onchain Governance\n\n        Built data and metrics interface for Olympus Pro (now Bond Protocol) here’s a quote from Edgecaser, the Data and Metrics lead, “We contracted the PG Subgrounds team to build a data feed for Olympus Pro bond performance, which needed to be built in as short a time as possible. Their team showed utmost professionalism, discipline, and talent in their craft. They delivered on time and to spec; with impeccable documentation. I look forward to working with them again.”\n\n        And then Edgecaser again from a more recent collab: “Playgrounds helped the Olympus Data and Metrics group monitor bond releases on day 1 with 5 minutes of setup. Their team made sure everything was up to snuff and problem-free. I would happily work with them again anytime.”\n\n        OHM-EPNS integration\n\n        Will enable information and updates to be sent to OHM token holders directly to EPNS (Ethereum Push Notification Service)-enabled wallets. According to the EPNS documentation: “EPNS is a notifications protocol which enables users (wallet addresses) to receive notifications. Using the protocol, any dApp, smart contract or service can send notifications to users (wallet addresses) in a platform agnostic fashion (mobile, web, or user wallets).”\n\n        EPNS will be immediately beneficial to the Olympus ecosystem, especially as we move towards on-chain governance.\n\nEnsuring a tight link between Grants activities and Olympus12 priorities\nThe Grants program has had requests for more than $13mm in funding across 100 unique applications. Over the last quarter 5 additional applicants have been identified as being within remit of current priorities of the protocol. These are:\n\n*\n\n    Olympus Scholars Program by Asfi of WAGMI Labs ($30,000)\n\n    20 active students. Check lectures here: https://www.youtube.com/@WagmiNerds\n\n    Content is here: https://rise.articulate.com/share/SzmSjROPlHfmftfbu7XmgIGSAigm3bMI#/\n\n*\n\n    Investigating the Interaction between MEV Bots and Olympus POL ($5,000)\n\n    Research document into MEV Bots impact on Olympus POL with research conclusions which can inform Policy.\n\n*\n\n    Elastic Finance DAO ($25,000)\n\n    Utilities include integrating OHM into the Elastic Vault and pairing the vault’s reward token EEFI with OHM, and engaging in other product development activities.\n\n*\n\n    TripsTrade ($25,000)\n\n    Building an open source payments SDK which will allow merchants to accept OHM as payment and keep it as OHM. Also integrating OHM as a payment method on the TT site.\n\n*\n\n    Asphodel ($25,000)\n\n    Building an economic controller system needed for proper integration of external tokens with their game smart-contracts. This would be turned into an open source SDK allowing other games to easily utilise OHM.\n\nBudget to date\n\nSince launching in early December 2021 the Grants program has been operating during an ongoing down trend in the markets. As such the USD value of OHM granted to the program via OIPs 55, 90 and 108 has seen a significant decrease in value requiring various difficult negotiations and compromises to manage these facts.\n\nGrants supported\n\n    Total of 629,447 USD of OHM awarded over the lifespan of the Grants Program.\n\n    On December 6th the community granted $1.5mm via OIP-50 (OGPv1) of which 164,083.48 USD was distributed. The remaining $1,335,916.52 worth of OHM remained in the DAO multisig.\n\n    OGPv1 committed to a total of $824,999.00 USD across 13 grantees.\n\n    On April 10th the community granted $1mm via OIP-90 which would cover the remaining $660,915.52 USD of obligations, new grants and operating costs for the program.\n\n    Over this period there was a further 50% drop in the market price of $OHM.\n\n    Due to these adverse market conditions the figure of $660,915.52 was negotiated down to a total of $271,363.61 which was paid out at a rate of $32USD per $OHM (the operating rate set by OIP-90) for grantees carrying over from OGPv1. This had the effect of a reduction in the USD value of the grants.\n\n    On August 21st the community granted $333,000 USD via OIP-108.\n\n    With Artemis ($50k) and OHM-EPNS ($9k), Olympus Scholars ($30k), MEV Olympus POL Research ($5k), Elastic Finance DAO ($25k), TripsTrade ($25k) and Asphodel ($25k) grants, this puts remaining funds available to the program at ~200 gOHM (~$500k)\n\nLegals and Governance\n\nGiven the launch of the Olympus Association (OIP-124 snapshot), it is proposed to transfer the remaining grants funds and contributor compensation budget to the Association.\n\nSummary\n\n    Do not add additional funds to the Grants Program at this time.\n\n    Cadence for community OIP and review to move from 3 month cycle to when additional funding would be requested\n\n    Fold Grants Program efforts under Partnerships using existing funds allocated as part of OIPs 55, 90, 108. Dissolve the Grants Committee, Partnerships team to review with Council’s ability to veto.\n\n    Transfer existing grants funds from OIPs 55, 90, 108 to the Olympus Association which will become the entity granting funds on behalf of the DAO\n\n    Existing and recently confirmed Grants will be stewarded beyond the tenure of this OIP.\n\n    Unused funds allocated to the program may be reallocated within the DAO should the program not continue.\n\nPolling period\n\nThe RFC polling period commences now and will run for 24 hours. The RFC may be followed by a forum temperature check which may then be followed by a Snapshot vote which will last at least 72 hours.\nPoll\n\nFor: Approve the changes as specified\n\nAgainst: Do not approve the changes as specified",

      "title": "AP-23 - Liquidity Incentives for Aura / Balancer Gauges on Hidden Hand / Paladin",
      "content": "Summary:\nEstablish an ongoing budget for voting market incentives in order to increase OHM pair liquidity and accumulate additional strategic assets. This will be capped at $400,000 every two weeks.\n\nBackground:\nTAP-15 permitted Olympus DAO to explore the use of incentives as a means to boost voting power to its LP Gauges. Starting the week of March 6th, 2023, Olympus Treasury committed $100,000 USDC to its OHM/ETH Pool located on AURA as a pilot.\n\nThe results of these efforts were favorable and resulted in the pool seeing between 10-14% vAPR over the epoch.\n\nAs part of the strategic vision outlined in the recent Treasury RFC, we plan to keep the AURA and use it to increase our market share within the AURA Ecosystem. This will also be used to further vote the gauges that tactically align with our proposed policy. The other rewards will preferably be managed through OTC offers to further increase our AURA position and Balancer Gauge Weight (This is subject to a cap of 5% of veBAL Voting Power).\n\nProposal:\nThe Treasury Team requests community approval of a per epoch (Two Week) budget, not to exceed $400,000, for use in Hidden Hand / Paladin incentivized markets. This will serve as a means of efficiently increasing our $AURA and $BAL ownership over time while simultaneously receiving high emissions towards our OHM pools.\n\nThe list of potential assets used to incentivize will include:\n\nOHM (Preferred)\nUSDC\nDAI\nFRAX\nOHM utilized will either come from OHM already owned by the Treasury or minted specifically for this purpose. Proceeds will be managed to ensure the process is accretive (even in the case of new OHM entering circulating supply).\n\nFor example:\n\nFor the 3/6/23 AURA/HH Epoch, 88k net incentives yielded 1.55m votes. These votes produced approximately $123,000 estimated incremental yield. Therefore, this was accretive to Treasury and favorably impacted Liquid Backing.\n\nAdditionally, this is consistent with our goals of accumulating increased governance power in the Balancer ecosystem.\n\nThis budget will exist for the remainder 2023, at which time the budget will be re-evaluated for size and scope.",

      "title": "OIP-133: Staking Rate Strategy",
      "content": "# Motivation - “how do we make 80% of OHM productive?”\nThe objective of this initiative is to formalize a strategy of turning the currently unproductive staked OHM and encouraging more productive behavior in the ecosystem. The projects outlined in Olympus DAO’s 2023 product delivery lineup are all huge steps forward in building out the OHM ecosystem, but the current staking model is not really compatible with them. Specifically, staking acts as an unnecessary hurdle for these projects to clear.\n\nWe should have a plan in place to encourage transitioning from staking to these new products as they go live. There are three Options below, which range from gentle to aggressive in terms of transition speed.\n\n# Option 1: One-time OHM bond as a temporary replacement\n## Steps taken:\n- Wait until lending AMO test is concluded, and for Flex Loan and alOHM have decent alternatives\n- Issue a single bond market at fixed 7.33% to mature in 6 months\n- After bond market closes, begin turning staking to 0 (cliff or slower decline tbd)\n\n## The problem solved:\nSeveral projects are more complicated to complete due to staking existing and the gOHM token’s ubiquity: OHM bonds, on chain gov, LP farming, and lending OHM for example.\n\nHowever, moving staking to zero now without an acceptable replacement risks a very poor user experience with no solid timeframe for improvement.\n\nThe compromise is to use an OHM bond to fill the gap while these projects are being worked on. Users who want “simple” yield can get into the bond. Meanwhile the “use case” projects are easier to complete since they don't have to compete with gOHM anymore.\n\n## Option 1 Pros:\n- Projects have better chance of success and are simpler to execute\n- Lowers emissions now; saves potentially $millions in OHM emissions\n- Maintains a base use case for users; “softens the blow”\n- “Forces” users to search out better yield opportunities and use their OHM\n\n## Option 1 Cons:\n- More complicated to manage vs keeping staking around\n- Requires partnership buy-in (flex loans, alOHM, Euler/Silo)\n- Potentially high dev effort to make fixed rate OHM bond at scale\n- High user effort; must unstake and move to OHM bond to maintain yield\n- Potential for above average sell off on maturity\n- Short term solution that will need addressing in a fixed time frame\n\n# Option 2: Wait to touch staking until suitable alternative projects are completed\n## Steps taken:\n- Wait until the following projects are implemented and successful:\nLending\nLeverage\nLP farming\nOHM bond vaults\nOnce the above list is satisfied, reduce staking to 0%\n\n## The problem solved:\nStaking is the core of the protocol currently, and gOHM is everywhere. Killing gOHM’s “simple yield” option before alternatives arise is a surefire way to put the protocol in a bad position.\n\nWe need to give the market time to find other solutions organically. We shouldn't ram through massive changes without having solid solutions in place first.\n\n## Option 2 Pros:\n- Simple, “wait and see” approach\n- Low risk of community disillusion with yet another change, Gives community plenty of time to warm up and embrace the idea\n- Gives partners plenty of time to find alternative yield paths\n\n## Option 2 Cons:\n- High cost in emissions vs ending staking sooner, potentially in the $millions\n- Does not solve the issue of staking cannibalizing on the success of other alternative projects (OHM bonds for example)\n- Impacts the likelihood of users seeking out of alternative yield sources while they are being rolled out (think: lending, LPing, or things under discussion like a passive OHM pool for Gearbox)\n- Potentially negative feedback loop of “wait and see”, but the problem could be staking so we never get to see\n\n# Option 3: Stepwise staking reduction\n## Steps taken:\n- Wait until Lending AMO test is finished (a few weeks, target completion is Week 13)\n- Reduce staking to 2.33%\n- Wait until the projects list from Option 2 is complete\n- Reduce staking to 0%\n\n## The problem solved:\nThis option is a bit of a compromise between the two other ones. It's less risky than Option 1 while still reducing the long term protocol cost. It's “smarter” than Option 2 while still avoiding complexity.\n\n## Option 3 Pros:\n- Relatively simple\n- Lowers cost to the protocol\n- Allows other projects to somewhat breathe and buys them time to be successful before fully killing staking\n\n## Option 3 Cons:\n- Kicks the can down the road, doesn't fully simplify other projects like OHM bonds\n- Does not solve for gOHM token making other projects more complex (like on chain gov)\n- Doesn't save as much as Option 1",

To match this, approve the minting of up to $5m in OHM for this vault in order for both assets to be deployed in a 50/50 liquidity pool.\n\n# Background \nThe Boosted Liquidity Engine (BLE) leverages Olympus’ competitive advantages (monetary policy flexibility and treasury strength) to mint OHM into liquidity pools with select high quality assets. LPs bring an asset (e.g., stablecoin, LSD) into newly developed vaults and the Olympus treasury mints OHM in equal value (for 50/50 pools) to match and create a complete LP position. LPs benefit from boosted liquidity mining opportunities and partner protocols are able to more efficiently drive liquidity mining programs and deepen supplemental liquidity for their tokens. Olympus benefits from LPs providing counter asset liquidity, enhancing OHM’s liquidity depth, which enables greater utility and stability. Furthermore, the BLE can be a powerful tool for partnerships. BLE is not intended to be utilized for any and all assets but rather select high-quality assets with which an OHM pairing would be beneficial.\n\nFor more information on the Boosted Liquidity Engine please refer to OIP-131.\n\n# Vault Details\nThe wstETH/OHM vault will be the first deployment of a BLE. As third parties add wstETH into the vault, the protocol will mint OHM to match this and deploy it into the liquidity pool and stake it to receive incentives.\n\nAll the reward tokens earned through this vault will be directed to wstETH depositors. The protocol itself will not receive these tokens, with the exception of trading fees which are accrued inside the LP token itself.\n\nThe proposed vault will launch with the following parameters: \n\n- Maximum capacity: $5m in wstETH provided by third parties & $5m in OHM minted by the protocol.\n- Pool: 50/50 wstETH/OHM on Balancer\n- Incentivization strategy: Aura staking & LDO rewards\n- Oracle: Chainlink\n- Fee: 0%\n\nNote that the maximum mint capacity is perpetual and can be utilized by the contracts until the vault closes and/or a governance vote changes these parameters.",

      "title": "OIP-130: Lending AMO as a key DAO project for 2023",
      "content": "# Summary\nFollowing OIP-128 and the new budget and compensation structure, designate the Lending AMO project as one of the key focus areas for 2023 and include it in the bonus program.\n\n# Motivation\nOIP-127 outlined the importance of Lending AMOs for Olympus:\n\n“Up to this point most integrations of OHM/gOHM in lending markets have focused on the collateral-side. With the recent changes through RBS and the resulting price stability and low volatility, OHM/gOHM are becoming preferred collateral assets to use - as the recent listings on Silo Finance and Fraxlend have shown. At the same time, it is important for the protocol to also start focusing on the lending-side of the market and to promote OHM as a good borrowable asset as well.\n\nThere are a few different reasons why. For borrowers it diversifies options to borrow “stable-ish” assets beyond just USD stablecoins. For traders and speculators it provides the option to hedge or short OHM, both of which are not easily doable today. While this may seem like a downside, shorting or hedging allows for more natural market dynamics and price discovery, and helps to prevent unsustainable premiums. For Ohmies lending markets also adds additional utility in that they can lend out OHM to interested parties on various lending platforms.\n\nMore importantly though - from the protocol’s perspective - is that lending markets allow for more efficient scaling of OHM as well as diversifying the assets that back circulating OHM. Rather than being exclusively backed by treasury assets, OHM minted into credit markets would be backed by a basket of collateral assets (or rather, a claim on those assets). As a result, the OHM supply could theoretically grow without increasing the treasury assets and/or diluting liquid backing of the floating supply by minting into these lending markets.\n\nFinally, Olympus will also be earning OHM-denominated yield on OHM that is lent out, creating a new income stream for the protocol.”\n\n# Project definition\nWhile OIP-127 approved a pilot programme to test out OHM lending markets, these initial tests will be performed through a multisig for ease of deployment. The full Lending AMO project encompasses a more sustainable solution that does not rely on holding funds on a multisig but rather on new smart contracts specifically developed for this purpose. The deployment of a lending AMO smart contract is thus the key deliverable for this project.\n\nThe full scope of the Lending AMO project is as follows:\n\n- List OHM as a borrowable asset on a select group of lending markets.\n- Implement a warm up period for OHM staking to prevent flashloan attacks.\n- Develop a set of new smart contracts - consisting of a base level contract and specific implementation contracts for each lending market - that allow for:\n- Minting into whitelisted lending markets\n- Setting a target interest rate and report the total supply needed in that market to achieve this target\n- Removing or adding liquidity to manage interest rates (i.e. to ensure rates are close to the target)\n- Harvesting yield\n- Audit these smart contracts before deploying them.\n\nNote that while some of these elements listed above are live today already, they were developed during January-February 2023 and so fall within the scope of OIP-128’s bonus program.\n\n# Deadline\nThe deadline to implement the full Lending AMO project - from the pilot programme to the actual deployment of the audited smart contracts - is the 31st of May.\n\nNote: this deadline has been changed in comparison to the original RFC. The main reason being is that the development and deployment of the Liquidity AMO contracts have been prioritized. A separate OIP will follow with more details on this project.\n\n# Bonus\nThe bonus allocated for the successful and timely completion of this project is 15% of the total bonus pool.",

The Association is an independent non-profit organization without any commercial purpose. The main goals are to research, develop, operate, and maintain Olympus, while developing Olympus Ecosystem and defending the interests of its members.\n\n## Motivation\nThe motivation for this proposal is to continue to fund the Olympus Association so that it may execute the budget approved by the Olympus DAO community.\n\nThe Olympus Association is important for providing contributors a formal structure to coordinate work, compensations, and establish relations with other organizations and contractors in order to fulfill the Olympus Protocol vision. The Olympus Association provides its members the necessary legal representation to increase efficiency and efficacy. Importantly, this OOP does not change or increase the overall budget. The existing budget already approved in OIP-128 applies.\n\n## Proposal\nWe seek authorization from the Olympus DAO Community to fund working capital based on the budgeting needs of Olympus Association. The current request is for covering expenses Q1 and Q2 2023, for a total of 2,070,000 USD in OHM equivalent.",

      "content": "Summary\n\nPilot deposit of no more than $500,000 DAI each into Vendor Finance and MYSO Finance Clearing House facilities pending several pre-conditions:\n\n    Vendor Finance will deploy their system to mainnet & provide a code review with OlympusDAO engineering teams\n\n    MYSO Finance will deploy their system to mainnet & provide a code review with OlympusDAO engineering teams\n\n    Cooler Loans is out of scope of this governance proposal. We will await a follow-up directly from Zeus regarding the audit before moving forward with a proposal.\n\nMotivation\n\nPer Zeus:\n\n    Lending has historically been a sore spot for Olympus. Rari Fuse stands out as the glaring example — Ohmies were plagued with unreasonably high interest rates and expensive & restrictive liquidation proceedings. This is especially nonsensical in the current environment, where OHM trades at/near/below backing and offers significantly more liquidity relative to supply than other, more lent to tokens like ETH, CRV, and others. Even now, we see little to no available liquidity on the two primary options (Vesta and Fraxlend), and high interest rates on Fraxlend. We can do better.\n\nThe Clearing House facility is a novel method for our treasury to deploy capital in an efficient way.  The two groups below propose different approaches to similar problems:\n\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1821-rfc-clearing-house-partnership-with-vendor-finance\n\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1905-rfc-clearing-house-partnership-with-myso-finance \n\nPer Vendor:\n\n        We have been working with UMAMI Finance to polish this concept and we are familiar with many edge-cases that are not immediately obvious. Umami DAO has been lending with Vendor out of their treasury and has made a consistent 40% APR. Currently they are lending $100k and taking a measured approach to lending. So far they have been satisfied with the service and we greatly value them as our partner. Please see their treasury report to learn more: https://blog.umami.finance/umami-finance-treasury-update-december-2022/\n\nPer MYSO:\n\n    We’ve added a script to backtest various pool parameterizations, which is open source and can be found here: https://github.com/mysofinance/notebooks/blob/main/olympus-dao-myso_v_1_1-backtest/olympus-dao-myso_v_1_1-simulation.ipynb For the above mentioned initial pool parameterization, the pool would’ve returned a RoI of 7.8% for the backtesting period from 2022-03-01 to 2023-01-16. The backtest was run with similar assumptions to the ones found in the previous mentioned alternative proposals. The MYSO Finance team is happy to provide additonal backtests on demand.\n\nProposal\n\nPilot deposit of no more than $500,000 DAI each into Vendor Finance and MYSO Finance Clearing House facilities pending several pre-conditions:\n\n    Vendor Finance will provide:\n        Mainnet deployment\n        Code review with OlympusDAO engineering\n\n    MYSO Finance will provide:\n\n        Mainnet deployment\n\n        Code review with OlympusDAO engineering\n\nPolling Period\n\nPoll will begin now and end in 5 days.\n\nPoll\n\n    Approve $500k pilot deposit into each protocol\n\n    Approve $500k to Vendor Finance (mainnet)\n\n    Approve $500k to MYSO Finance\n\n    Do not approve",

      "title": "OIP 129 - Council Framework",
      "content": "Proposal\n\nThe Olympus council would like to propose several amendments to the original OIP-91, including introducing a re-election framework, reporting requirements, the number of council members, and several miscellaneous improvements.\n\n- The council proposes a 1-year term for elected council members\n\nThe council will be put up for a vote of confidence, voted on by OHM holders\n\nIf the vote of confidence passes, the council is elected for a period of 1 year\n\nIf the vote of confidence fails, an election process will take place to elect a new council\n\nThe election will be done by DAO contributors above level 4 (full time equivalent). This is an interim solution until we can cement this in an OCG structure. The framework for replacing council members during this term remain unchanged (see OIP-91)\n\n- The council proposes formalizing the reporting requirements by the council\n\nWe propose a council update every other month within the DAO\n\nWe propose a council update every other month for the community\n\n- The council proposes reducing the number of council members from 7 to 5 to reflect the changes in overall DAO size and structure.\n\nCouncil Framework\n\nTo offset against major holiday periods, we suggest the term to start in February.\n\n(Re-)Election procedure\n\nIn the last week of January and July, a vote of confidence will be posted on snapshot (or any future governance platform) to poll if the community is in favor of continuing with the current council composition or if it feels changes are needed. To aid this process and give the community insights into the current workings of the council, a council update should be provided before going to a vote.\n\nThe choice for not doing a full re-election process every 12 months is done to reduce overhead, avoid friction and keep the focus on building out Olympus as opposed to time-consuming election processes. If, however, the OHM holders are dissatisfied with the performance of the council, we propose the following framework:\n\nWe propose a 2-week election timeline which would start immediately after the conclusion of a negative vote of confidence.\n\nWeek 1: \n\nDAO contributors can flag their desire to run for council during this week in a public channel in the DAO server, to avoid any risk of censorship. During this week, candidates should lay out their motivations and vision for Olympus. Additionally, they should explain what they would bring to the council. \n\nWeek 2:\n\nAt the start of week 2, all candidates who have submitted their motivation will be able to present this to other DAO contributors during a voice call in the DAO, the order of presentation will be randomized to prevent any favoritism.\n\nAfter this call, a blind vote will take place where DAO contributors above level 4 will be able to cast votes to the amount of council seats. We opt for a blind vote to reduce animosity and friction between DAO contributors.\n\nIn case two or more contributors have the same amount of votes, another round of voting will have to be executed with only these candidates on the ballot.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the voting round(s), a vote will be presented to the community to confirm the composition of this council.\n\nIn case of a positive vote, a hand-over will take place between the original and new council members to ensure a smooth transition. During this time, the previous council is still active. If the vote gets rejected, the process will have to start over again until a council is approved by the holders.\n\nThe newly elected council will take its place at the start of the next week on Monday and will present themselves to the community during the first following community call.\n\nThis proposal combines both ownership of the OHM holders, who ultimately will have the power to push for a new council while still giving a voice to the DAO contributors, who will have to execute the vision of the council and has unique insights into the capabilities of the candidates.\n\nCouncil size\nWe propose the reduction of council members from 7 to 5 for the following reasons:\n\n- Since the introduction of the first council, the DAO has consolidated significantly. We feel it is appropriate for the council to be smaller as well.\n\n- The reduction would increase the efficiency of the council. In the past cycle, it could be difficult to get the opinion of 7 members at the same time.\n- The cost of the council would be reduced, leaving more budget for other departments.\n\n- Zeus has not been an active council member and has been acting more as a senior advisor to Olympus, a capacity he will still be involved in going forward.\n- Indigo has indicated that he would like to step down from the council for the next cycle to focus more on development.\nThe remaining council members are Apollo, Hohmward, Jala, Shadow and Wartull\n\nUpdate on reporting requirements\n\nThe council has evaluated feedback both from the community and the DAO contributors and identified the need for increased transparency on the workings and decisions of the DAO. For this, we propose:\n\n- A council update every other month within the DAO\n- A council update every other month for the community\n\nA community Q&A was conducted on Thursday the 2nd of February to address community questions on the roles and responsibilities of the council.\n\n\nPoll (Have to limit because of limited Characters)\n\nFor: \n1. Keep current council in place and implement proposed changes => Keep Council + Impl Changes\n2: Keep current council and amend proposed changes => Keep Council\n3: Change current council and implement proposed changes => Change Council + Impl Changes\n\nAgainst: Remove current council and proceed with election procedure => Change Council",

      "content": "Simple Summary\n\nDeposit $33 million of idle Frax into USDC / Frax (FraxBP) and stake on Convex\n\nBackground\n\nOlympus currently has ~$58 million of Frax, of which $25 million is deposited in the FraxBP and staked on Convex. The remainder is sitting idly in the treasury, earning no yield.\n\nMotivation\n\nAs of this writing, the pool is projected to yield ~4.95% APR including FXS rewards. The incremental $33 million deposited and staked would earn the protocol an additional ~$1.6 million per year. \n\nGiven the risk profiles of the two assets in the pool – USDC and Frax – the risk of LPing is no greater than holding Frax “naked” (i.e., if Frax were to depeg, the pool would end up all Frax – exactly where we stand today). Of course, there is smart contract risk, but both Curve and Convex have proved to be extremely robust.\n\nProposal\n\nDeposit the remaining $33 million to the FraxBP and stake on Convex. This proposal would not preclude Olympus from pursuing other opportunities. The FraxBP should be viewed as the \"base camp\" for Frax holdings, with its yield serving as a hurdle rate for other deployments.",

One of the goals of that proposal was to farm rewards from the Protocol Owned Liquidity present on the Balancer protocol.\n\nOlympus DAO has previously asked permission to pilot deposit POL into the Aura Protocol (see here: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1323-tap-14-pilot-deposit-into-aura-finance/6) and the thesis on Aura has not changed since then. Aura contracts have remained solid (which makes sense since they’re a fork of Convex contracts: https://github.com/aurafinance/convex-platform). Aura Finance has proven to be a driving factor in the overall Balancer ecosystem and it makes sense for Olympus to take part in it.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\nUsing a risk analysis framework developed by the DAO, the Policy team have attempted to score various protocols based on some subjective and non-subjective data.\n\nLink to Risk assessment:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NivudWfWvrkKTdgX_Z2tgfrP6mH761C3O8vqkO4Zn14/edit?usp=sharing\n\n## Implementation\n\nImplementation is simple and involves staking the two BPT’s in their respective Aura positions.

However, we believe there is room for improvement.\n\nDue to the overall market sentiment and events that transpired in this year, the OKRs, most of which were market-driven, have not been met. These OKRs were meant to be difficult, but the main issue we found was that the contributors couldn’t directly affect them and thus felt unmotivated when it was clear the market wouldn’t allow us to reach them.\n\nThe proposal below outlines how we plan to tackle that problem, as well as ensure timely completion of projects that are in the best interest of Olympus and its community.\n\n## Proposal\n\n### Bonus\n\nInstead of the current OKR-based bonuses system outlined in OIP-102, allow for a total bonus budget of $1,000,000, to be paid in (g)OHM. This budget would be allocated to projects submitted by the DAO to the community for approval, with the requisite that in 2023 there are at least 3 projects passed by the community and with a maximum bonus per project of $333,333.\n\nAll DAO contributors above an average contribution level of 4, active in the DAO over the course of a project and at bonus payout would receive their share of the bonus allocated to that project at the end of the calendar year. The contributor’s bonus share would be weighted based on the average contribution level over the course of a project.\n\nAs long as projects are completed within a month of the deadline (deadline + 1 month), the bonus for that project would be paid out in full. After that point, the bonus would start to decay on the following scale.\n\nIn addition, for the Council members and Strategos (department leads), given their lower base compensation compared to the role, introduce a potential bonus of $120k per person, to be distributed only in the case of successful and timely (deadline + 3 months) completion of all projects that passed a community vote, again, no less than 3 over the course of 2023.\n\nIn the case of completed projects that had their bonus decayed due to not meeting deadlines, but no more than 3m past the deadline, take the weighted average of the bonus percentages to calculate the percentage of $120k that has been earned.\n\nThis compensation structure is meant to align the compensation with the responsibilities of the department leads, responsible for their respective departments, and the Council, responsible for overseeing the whole DAO operations.\n\n### Projects\n\nProjects that unlock bonuses must be deemed high-impact projects and will be submitted to a community vote via an OIP. Each project proposal must contain a description of the project, definition of what constitutes project completion and a deadline for which the DAO will be held accountable for. Along with the project spec, it must contain the bonus allocated to it for timely completion (100%).\n\nIn the extraordinary case that, after the initial project proposal to the community, a project deadline needs to be extended due to unforeseen circumstances or better solutions/improtvements are found, or a project needs to be deprioritized or canceled for justifiable reasons, the contributors would need to request this from the community and provide a detailed explanation in a OIP forum post.\n\n### Base Compensation\n\nUp until now, the DAO has worked within the limits outlined in OIP-102 - a $370k monthly base compensation budget, with an allowance for a maximum budget flex of 25%, making the potential maximum budget in any given month $462.5k\n\nGiven the proposed introduction of project based bonuses, as well as a more efficient DAO today, we propose that the monthly base compensation be reduced to $280k, with the same allowance for a maximum budget flex of 25%, making the potential maximum budget in any given month $350k This is a 24% reduction in the monthly base compensation budget.\n\n![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MOxPAvLUGoS2iaEliWEb_3KptDU2DmV15wCuTgxzMsRfugbEPRHw0hqkBqQ1gYQv78Ss8_tAPV2oyaEdRsDPW9ubW1j5GS0ggJRaR4vJonyOlfEBnw9FohQpdGx3REvRM670tW2AcD0jfd4sDkFqn-xxpsEo3hff4Np9EwGGKjBiEXjBbBaJjl4Xhl7xZA)\n\n### Legal\n\nWe predict a legal budget of up to $200k will be needed for 2023. The law firms will be assisting Olympus with the following:\n\n- Evaluate potential compliance improvement areas\n\n- Identify any proposed risk mitigation steps to be taken by Olympus to comply with applicable law and regulation\n\n- Evaluate legal requirements that mandate, and/or prudential risk mitigation considerations\n\n- Advise Olympus with respect to the design of any compliance programs, and preparation of appropriate policies, procedures and internal controls integral to such programs, for presentation to the Olympus Community\n\n- Prepare summary recommendations(s) describing the proposed risk mitigation steps, and compliance programs to be implemented, for approval by the Olympus Community\n\n### Audits\n\nAs outlined in [OIP-98](https://snapshot.org/#/olympusdao.eth/proposal/0x73734b411aa09010d97b9fac22294beaa2f87c09296511668a2cea7e6ba9b541), the community approved a yearly audit budget of $500,000. This is just an allowance and does not mean the DAO will need to spend the full amount.\n\n### Services, Subscriptions, Other Operational Costs\n\nThe estimates for subscriptions and other operational costs are based on historical data. Services and service providers (simulations, risk analysis, etc.) are variable and not included in this budget framework. Instead, they would be listed in the quarterly report.\n\n### 2023 Budget\n\nThe budget below is the projected maximum, with maximum spend in all categories (not including potential budget flex of 25%) and full bonuses unlocked.\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/kCgh2FLHvipkHOBoo60QBOxDRijMXFJyxAakJA9OB3hOZGWVjUXM6TvnxFjeuhATYa_r2jsfgMZonZZKNBwLXzYa6vBWUDYRU2-5_R5gXh_x_XJSJRrajo2jOvzes1roQgbBJyYeuCyHwovD0emoU0sgtiNLJHUct7cobBei2jnlvhT0ZzbGvhpuKKyKYg)\n\nThe DAO currently holds 1,559,510 OHM worth $15,454,744, visible [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x245cc372c84b3645bf0ffe6538620b04a217988b).\n\nThe spend for 2022 can be found in our Q4 report available on the [Transparency page](https://www.olympusdao.finance/transparency#quarterly-reports).\n\nIn the case that market conditions change and the compensation needs to be adjusted in order for Olympus to stay competitive, the Council would propose an amendment to the community for approval.\n\nThe Council also reserves the right, outlined in [OIP-91](https://snapshot.org/#/olympusdao.eth/proposal/0xf90119baf2b7bca681d41ec611e093363dcff38ff5efa1c3aada55da91aac3a5), to approve urgent expenses, including but not limited to security-related expenses, tooling costs, contracted services. These expenses must be detailed in the quarterly report.\n\nIf this proposal passes, it would nullify and supersede OIP-102.",

      "title": "TAP-18: DAI Savings Rate Deposit ",
      "content": "### Summary\n\nDeposit $77M DAI into the the DAI Savings Rate Earn Strategy\n\n### Motivation\n\nMakerDAO recently increased the DAI savings rate (DSR) to 1% as a result of the revenues earned by their Real-World Asset (RWA) activities. Olympus Treasury being one of the largest DAI holder, should take advantage of the new savings rate to increase its revenues.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n\nThe DSR contract has been live since November 2019, was audited by Trail of Bits, has held at its peak usage over $350M of DAI holders assets and to this date has not suffered any exploit. This makes the Dai Savings Rate smart contract one of the oldest and most battle-tested set of code in the Defi ecosystem. Due to the time in production and significant TVL over time the DSR contract is seen as a low risk contract by the treasury team.\n\nThe allocator contract is developed by Olympus, and is an adapted copy of the same allocator contract that is used for all other treasury assets held in allocators (Fraxswap, CVX, Aave etc). The Olympus allocator has been used for a long time with significant value. The risk of asset loss is seen as low by the treasury team. However, this specific allocator deployment is not audited and therefor we suggest that the significant treasury reserve deposit is done in two tranches. It is proposed that a first deposit of 1M DAI is done to encourage potential exploit of the allocator contract. After 2 weeks this is followed by the main deposit.\n\n### How Does the DSR work?\n\n- Dai holders can lock their Dai into the DSR smart contract at any time. Once locked, Dai continuously accrues to the users balance, based on the current DSR.\n\n- Dai holders can earn savings automatically and natively while retaining control of their Dai. The DSR smart contract has no withdrawal limits, deposit limits, or liquidity constraints\n\nSource: https://github.com/makerdao/community/blob/master/faqs/dsr.md\n\nIn regards to Treasury assets needed to conduct market operations under RBS, note that:\n\n- Deposit and withdrawals can be done at any moment. There are no lock-ups and no fees for using the Dai Savings Rate.\n\n- Twice the total of DAI used by RBS for the last completed month will remain unstaked in the Olympus Treasury.\n\nInitially, the RBS contract/ new Treasury would be replenished when/if needed by executing withdrawals manually from the DSR contracts.\n\nEventually, RBS contract will be able to interact directly with the DSR contract which would remove the need for an intermediary manual transaction.\n\n### Execution\n\nDeposit 1M DAI from reserves to DAI Savings Rate module via Olympus Allocator.\n\nAfter 2 weeks follow up with the main $76M deposit.\n\n### References\n\nThe Olympus Dai Savings Allocator is currently deployed:\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x0EA26319836fF05B8C5C5afD83b8aB17dd46d063#code\n\nAllocator Code: \n\nhttps://github.com/OlympusDAO/olympus-contracts/blob/allocators/contracts/allocators/DSRAllocator.sol",

      "title": "TAP-16 Pilot Opyn Strategies Deposits",
      "content": "Summary:\nWhitelist the Opyn Crab V2 Strategy for Olympus treasury deposits. The goal of these vaults is to allow ETH exposure to increase decentralization but reduce the overall volatility of ETH. \n\nUpon approval we will deposit 150E (~$225k) each into the two available Opyn strategies (Crab USDC and Zen Bull).  Following six months of deposit period, we will share the performance of these two deposits - the vaults automatically rebalance MWF.\n\nBackground:\nOIP-20 defined a framework for Olympus where 33% of excess treasury reserves can be deposited to earn yield in whitelisted protocols. This proposal seeks to add Opyn’s Crab V2 Strategy to this whitelist while keeping the same 33% treasury deposit cap. As this is a whitelist proposal, a risk analysis was performed and can be found below.\n\nAbout Crab:\nOpyn is a DeFi options protocol and the team that designed and developed the smart contracts for Squeeth, a power perpetual tracking ETH2 in the form of the ERC-20 oSQTH. Crab is an automated short-volatility, delta-neutral vault strategy that allows depositors to reap the benefits of shorting oSQTH without taking a view on if the price of ETH will move up or down. By creating a mix of oSQTH debt and ETH collateral, Crab earns returns in USD terms when price of ETH fluctuates within a relatively stable range with periods of low volatility (compared to market expectations). The vault regularly rebalances via a recurring batch auction that allows Crab to buy or sell a target amount of oSQTH to neutralize delta\n\nMore about Crab V2:\nOverview\nAuction Example\nDepositing, Withdrawing, & Hedging\nFAQs\nSqueeth’s Delta\nMotivation:\nCrab V2 provides a short volatility, delta-neutral strategy that aims to earn returns on the treasury’s plethora of idle ETH assets. Delta-neutrality can allow the treasury to earn USD-denominated returns without taking a position on the price of ETH itself. The treasury is currently long ETH and recent market fluctuations have frequently oscillated the dollar value of the treasury. The delta-neutral strategy aims for (1) rapid drops in ETH price to have a less significant impact on the Olympus treasury’s dollar value and (2) generating USD-denominated returns when ETH moves less than people’s expectations (between hedges).\n\nRisks:\nVulnerability: A vulnerability in the Crab V2 or Squeeth smart contracts could lead to partial or complete loss of funds. Crab V2 has been audited and is insured by Sherlock and Squeeth has been audited by Trail of Bits and Akira.\nLiquidation: While Crab Strategy deposits can be liquidated if it falls below the safe-collateralization ratio of 150%, rebalancing on a time-based or ETH-price-changes threshold helps prevent a liquidation from occurring. Crab has never been liquidated to date.\nETH Price Movement & Volatility: If there are changes to implied volatility or the price of ETH moves by more than is implied by the Squeeth funding, Crab can lose money.\nSlippage: Crab can experience slippage when rebalancing (depending on clearing price from the batch auction) or due to price impact when deposits trigger a Uniswap sell.\n\nProtocol Analysis:\nUsing a risk analysis framework developed by the DAO, the Policy and Partnerships teams have attempted to score various protocols based on some subjective and non-subjective data.\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10rSv9DBA0l2RdgeQ1Lg2DkB-Rusl7ssW7h9qQTMcuRE/edit?usp=sharing\n\n",

      "title": "OIP-127 OHM Lending Markets Pilot Programme",
      "content": "# Summary\n\nThe proposed pilot programme is the first foray of Olympus in DeFi lending markets and aims to introduce and promote OHM as a borrowable asset. More specifically, through this programme the protocol would mint up to 200k OHM and lend it out (in tranches) on Silo and Euler to test demand and interest rate models.\n\n# Motivation\n\nUp to this point most integrations of OHM/gOHM in lending markets have focused on the collateral-side. With the recent changes through RBS and the resulting price stability and low volatility, OHM/gOHM are becoming preferred collateral assets to use - as the recent listings on Silo Finance and Fraxlend have shown. At the same time, it is important for the protocol to also start focusing on the lending-side of the market and to promote OHM as a good borrowable asset as well.\n\nThere are a few different reasons why. For borrowers it diversifies options to borrow “stable-ish” assets beyond just USD stablecoins. For traders and speculators it provides the option to hedge or short OHM, both of which are not easily doable today. While this may seem like a downside, shorting or hedging allows for more natural market dynamics and price discovery, and helps to prevent unsustainable premiums. For Ohmies lending markets also adds additional utility in that they can lend out OHM to interested parties on various lending platforms.\n\nMore importantly though - from the protocol’s perspective - is that lending markets allow for more efficient scaling of OHM as well as diversifying the assets that back circulating OHM. Rather than being exclusively backed by treasury assets, OHM minted into credit markets would be backed by a basket of collateral assets (or rather, a claim on those assets). As a result, the OHM supply could theoretically grow without increasing the treasury assets and/or diluting liquid backing of the floating supply.\n\nFinally, Olympus will also be earning OHM-denominated yield on OHM that is lent out, creating a new income stream for the protocol.\n\n# Pilot details\n\n## Contracts\n\nMinted OHM for lending markets will be supplied through a lending AMO that is currently under development (and will go into audit afterwards). Depending on the timeline of the contract deployment, this OIP also allows for seeding the initial OHM lending markets through a multisig in order to start these pilot markets as soon as possible. After deploying the lending AMO contracts the multisig would unwind its position, while the lending AMO scales into them.\n\n## Pilot markets\n\nFor this pilot Euler and Silo Finance were selected as the initial lending markets. Both have the option of OHM as a borrowable asset and we’ve worked with both teams to set an interest rate model that makes sense for the protocol.\n\nEuler currently has a TVL of $189m and has been audited by several firms including Halborn, Solidified and ZK Labs, Certora and Sherlock. Collateral assets on Euler (i.e. assets that OHM can be borrowed against) are stablecoins such as USDC, DAI, and USDT, ETH and liquid staking derivatives such as stETH and wstETH, and WBTC. For more information on Euler please see here: https://docs.euler.finance/\n\nSilo Finance is a newer lending market and focuses on isolated lending pools. It currently has a TVL of $22m and has been audited by Certora, ABDK, and Quantstamp. Collateral assets on Silo are ETH and XAI, their stablecoin (currently backed by USDC and ETH). For more information on Silo please see here: https://silopedia.silo.finance/welcome/what-is-silo-finance\n\n## Capacity\n\nThe maximum OHM minted through the pilot programme is 200k. These funds will not be lent out all at once but instead will be added to the pilot lending markets in tranches, both to see the scaling of demand as well as to manage interest rates (see below). Note that any OHM minted but not borrowed will not increase the circulating supply. Only after a borrower deposits collateral and borrows OHM will this be considered part of the circulating OHM supply.\n\n## Interest rates\n\nManaging the OHM interest rates in these pilot lending markets will be key. If interest rates are low, it would incentivize users to borrow OHM and stake it, netting the difference between those two rates. If interest rates are high, it obviously discourages people from borrowing OHM in the first place. Through the pilot programme and lending AMO the protocol could add or withdraw liquidity in order to keep the interest rates at a level where it is both profitable for the protocol as well as interesting for the borrower.\n\nEuler and Silo both have different interest rate models. The Euler OHM market will have a base interest rate of 5% (at 0% utilization) with a kink interest rate of 20% before increasing exponentially. The Silo interest rate model is still being finalized and works differently than Euler, but at an “optimal utilization” of the market the rate would be close to today’s staking rate.\n\n# Metrics to track\n\nThroughout this pilot programme, the protocol will be tracking key performance metrics. Indicators of success for this pilot would be:\n\n- Consistent demand, measured by the # of borrowed OHM, as we scale into the markets over time\n- Interest rates that are close to or above the staking rate\n- Healthy mix of user actions (e.g. is borrowed OHM used for shorting, staking, bonding, et cetera)\n\nOn top of that we will also track utilization rates, changes in circulating OHM backing (i.e. the ratio PCV-backed vs. collateral-backed OHM), and gross interest rate income for the treasury.\n\nDepending on the performance of these pilot markets another OIP can be created to scale the capacity or to add additional lending markets.",

      "title": "[OIP-126] Self-Repaying OHM: Alchemix alOHM Launch Support",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nSupport Alchemix in launching a self-repaying OHM product (alOHM) by 1) providing them with $50k in liquidity incentivization support per quarter for a total of two quarters, and 2) adding 150k protocol-owned OHM into the Balancer alOHM/OHM pool to help bootstrap liquidity.\n\n## Background\n\nAlchemix is a future-yield-backed synthetic asset protocol that gives users advances on various yield strategies via a synthetic token. The Alchemix loans are self-repaying, interest-free and non-liquidating. Today, Alchemix offers various strategies to borrow against select USD-pegged stablecoins (alUSD) and ETH (alETH).\n\nAlchemix’s focus over the last months has been to expand cross-chain and to deploy new yield strategies for the existing alAssets. In parallel, the Alchemix and Olympus teams have also been exploring the creation of a new alAsset and to launch alOHM as the next product. This self-repaying OHM loan product has been frequently requested by both communities in the past, and with this proposal (and the parallel proposal on the Alchemix forum here) we offer both communities the opportunity to make this a reality.\n\nFor Olympus, alOHM represents a novel use case that adds further utility to the token. Ohmies will be able to take out liquidation and interest free loans, enjoy similar Alchemix strategies for alOHM as for alUSD and alETH, as well as LP the alOHM/OHM pool. From the protocol's perspective, it is invaluable for other protocols to build on top of the OHM monetary layer and so we want to support the (first) teams doing so.\n\nAs a piece of background information, the feasibility of creating new alAssets for Alchemix depends on various factors, such as demand, a sustainable yield source, and a clear path towards profitability. The major expense for Alchemix to launch a new product is the creation and incentivization of a new liquidity pool for the synthetic asset.\n\nAs such, this proposal focuses on support for bootstrapping alOHM liquidity that will make the product become sustainable over time (and able to operate independently without direct Olympus support after the bootstrapping period).\n\n## alOHM details\n\nThe alOHM vault will launch with the following parameters:\n\n- Accepted collateral: OHM, gOHM\n- Deposit cap: 1,000,000 OHM\n- LTV%: 50%\n\nAt launch, it will have a single yield strategy which uses the OHM ARR for the self-repaying loan. In the future, if additional yield sources are available that Alchemix supports, these could potentially be added as well.\n\nIn terms of an alOHM/OHM liquidity pool, both teams have agreed that Balancer is the preferred choice. Not only would alOHM/OHM route directly into the existing OHM/DAI and OHM/ETH pools, Balancer/Aura currently also offers a more favourable incentivization/bribe multiplier than competitors.\n\nFor more details on the vault workings and specifications, please visit the parallel proposal on the Alchemix forum here: https://forum.alchemix.fi/public/d/385-aip-76-alohm-new-alasset-launch-proposal\n\n## Olympus support\n\nIn order to make this product feasible to deploy for Alchemix, and to help bootstrap the launch, Alchemix has requested Olympus’s support for the following two things.\n\nFirst, Olympus would help co-incentivize the liquidity pool during the initial bootstrapping period. More specifically, this would be support in the form of $50k per quarter for a total of two (2) quarters. Alchemix will combine these funds with up to 500 ALCX/week to incentivize/bribe the pool in order to attract liquidity.\n\nSecond, Olympus would deploy 150k protocol-owned OHM into the Balancer alOHM/OHM pool to help bootstrap liquidity at the start. These funds would be sourced from previously inverse-bonded OHM. By creating the LP token, Olympus would be earning trading fees as well as BAL/AURA rewards (assuming the gauge vote for the pool passes, and after staking the LP tokens).\n\n**Note that for Alchemix the launch of alOHM is dependent on support during the bootstrapping period and that without it the product is likely not feasible to be deployed at this time.**",

      "title": "OIP-125 RBS Parameter Changes",
      "content": "## Summary\nAuthorize the following changes to the RBS system:\n1. Globally tighten spreads to 7.5% cushion and 15% wall spread\n2. Logic change: If 30D MA is below liquid backing, set target price to liquid backing AND regeneration time to 0\n3. Logic change: If 30D MA is above liquid backing, set target price to 30D Moving Average (MA) AND regeneration time to 18/21 epochs\n\nAlso authorize the Policy MS to optionally launch an Inverse Bond market at its discretion to encourage price to move above the new Lower Wall as needed. If needed, this market would launch before the above changes take place.\n\n## Context and Motivation\nThe Range Bound Stability (RBS) system launched on 18 November, and has operated very well with support cushions being activated a few times to reduce volatility. A key takeaway so far has been that the market seems to be supporting price in the cushions before they are activated by RBS. A good example of this is in the price action on 26 November at 1700 UTC. A single massive sell pushed price into the cushion zone, but other market participants “bought the dip” and moved price back into the range. This happened without expending any Treasury funds.\n\nHowever, during this time the target price (currently the 30d MA of OHM price) has continued to decline. As a result, the cushions continue to trend downwards. Treasury support moves lower and the resistance (sell) cushion and wall are now below backing. This trend is not ideal, as it really doesn’t make sense for the Treasury to sell OHM below backing. It’s purely dilutive to the Treasury and OHM holders, and suppresses price movement to a point of premium. Following the 30d MA this far below backing also shows us a point of improvement for the system: since the Treasury can infinitely support price below backing, and it’s clear that the market will help support the Treasury while in the cushions, it makes sense to follow the Liquid Backing figure as the Target Price instead of 30d MA, while the MA is below backing.\n\n*Reminder: the spirit of launching RBS is to find the optimal parameters for all scenarios that RBS could encounter. This OIP is intended to be a step towards optimizing Treasury utilization and market performance in a global bear market scenario. We can further tune these parameters if we find after implementation that the market isn't responding as predicted here.*\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- **The minimumTargetPrice variable will be manually passed into the contract, set to the Liquid Backing price for the launch of this OIP.** Following Liquid Backing in an automated way requires the Liquid Backing figure to be available on-chain. This can be done either with a direct calculation, or through an Oracle. These two options will be explored but are not ready yet, so to start the Policy will periodically update this number. Once the DAO finds a suitable automated method, we will transition to that.\n\n- **The new proposed Lower Wall would be around $8.87, which could be above the market price of OHM at the time of launch.** This is not a bad thing, it just creates an easy arb for an individual to profit off of. In order to facilitate fair and smooth price action leading up to the launch of these changes, the DAO is asking for permission to launch an Inverse Bond market ahead of time on an as-needed basis. This may not be needed if price organically meets the Lower Wall beforehand.\n\n- **Regeneration time of 0 means that the Policy MS will be able to regenerate the lower wall capacity instantly.** This should be automated in the future, in the same spirit as the minimumTargetPrice above. Since the Lower Wall effectively has infinite capacity while below Liquid Backing, it should serve as a “floor” while OHM trends below Liquid Backing.\n\n- **Restore regeneration time to 18/21 epochs (as it is currently) when the MA goes above backing.** While OHM price is above Liquid Backing, the Treasury could theoretically run out of funds trying to support the market with the Lower Cushion and Wall. This is the main reason to reinstate the original regeneration time to 18/21 epochs while above backing.",

      "title": "OIP-123 RBS Launch & Initial Parameters",
      "content": "# Summary\n**OIP-118 Olympus Strategy formally approved the launch of a Range Bound Stability system.** This OIP is to formalize a set of necessary permissions to launch the RBS system.\n\n- Approve an initial set of parameters for the system implementation.\n- Approve a set of emergency conditions under which the autonomous operations of the system could be stopped by the Policy multisig to prevent exploits, bugs, and/or unexpected behaviors that can be harmful to the protocol.\n- Approve an estimated 12 month budget to fund triggering key functions by keepers\n- Approve the launch of RBS\n\n## Motivation\nThe implementation of the RBS system aims to increase automation and bring stability to the Olympus ecosystem in an algorithmic manner. Proper configuration of the system is of great import to minimize risk.\n\nThe RBS system will always have room for improvement and further automation using a dynamic controlling system. The Policy team wants to progressively increase its robustness and autonomy, as the understanding of the system increases and its behavior is proven over time.\n\nTo speed up this learning curve, and to provide an optimal set of initial parameters, the Policy R&D team has created extensive simulations of the system. The team tested the system under different market conditions to fine-tune an initial set of parameters, which serve as a starting point and a benchmark for both future parameter iterations and a more advanced controlling system.\n\nSince the system will have the ability to autonomously perform market operations using Treasury funds, it is extremely important to progressively add funds to the system and have a backstop method to be able to stop all market operations if malicious actors are able to exploit the system. To that end, this proposal requests the authority for the DAO to turn off the system by closing all active markets and setting capacity limits to 0.\n\n## Parameter Simulation Report\nThe Policy R&D team has created a report of the modeling and simulation effort done to fine-tune the initial parameters.\n\nThis report recaps all the development steps, as well as the analysis framework that the broader Policy team used to come up with the final parameter proposal.\n\nThe report can be found here: https://olympusdao.notion.site/RBS-Report-fd88cb37208d4b0f9abaca4e276f9ddd\n\n# Proposal\nInitialize the RBS system with the following parameters:\n- length of the target price MA: 30 days\n- max liquidity ratio: 0.14375\n- ask/bid factor: 0.095\n- cushion factor: 0.3075\n- wall offset: 0.295\n- cushion offset: 0.1675\n- mint and sync: 0\n- reinstate window: Yes, 18/21 epochs\n\n**Initialize the RBS system with the following price target:**\n- initial price target: 30d MA at time of launch\n\n**Approve the treasury team to fund the new treasury contract in multiple stages from the current treasury contract.**\n\nDefinitions:\n- reserves: all DAI in the Olympus treasury contracts\n- liquidity: all DAI in Olympus treasury owned LP positions (including Balancer, Aura, Curve and Fraxswap)\n- liquidity ratio: liquidity / reserves\n\nSet up the Policy multisig as the admin of the Operator contract, effectively giving it permission to perform an emergency stop of the RBS system if any of the following conditions are met:\n- Flash loan / Exploit / Treasury attack (>2x capacity lost in 24h)\n- Manipulation of the price oracles (Chainlink oracle price delta >10% from Balancer main pool price)\n- Market capacity >10% delta vs calculated theoretical\n- Fast price depreciation (>20% price breakout outside lower wall in less than 6h)\n\n**An emergency stop is comprised only of the following actions:**\n- Deactivate RBS operations\n- Close all active markets, halting all current bond emissions (both reserve and inverse)\n- Fall back to OIP-94B temporarily until RBS goes back online\n\n**The Policy multisig would not have the authority to touch the system other than described above.**\n\n## Approve 5,475 OHM for keepers\nAs part of RBS, there is a beat() function in the Heart.sol policy. This function is critical to running RBS and needs keepers (bots) to trigger it. Due to that, we’re requesting a budget for these keeper rewards. Our best estimate is that we’d need 5,475 OHM a year for these keepers, but it may be more or less depending on OHM and ETH price, as well as gas prices in general.\n\nAfter at least 1 month of the RBS system being active, the community should re-evaluate the need for this emergency shutdown authority. The hope is that with enough time, the system can be proven enough to warrant a fully autonomous and automated operation.",

      "title": "OIP-121: Treasury Restructure",
      "content": "Introduction and Summary\n\nThis proposal separates current treasury and DAO assets into protocol reserve assets, protocol controlled assets, DAO owned and DAO controlled assets.\n\nThe primary aim of this proposal is to increase the level of trust, decentralization and autonomy in the protocol and prepare for Olympus on-chain governance by separating and clearly delineating assets under protocol control and DAO control as indicated in the Olympus 2022 Strategy (OIP-118).\n\nA secondary aim is to clarify the use of funds in the protocol and the DAO. Protocol reserves are used for protocol mechanics that stabilize OHM price and provide liquidity. The final goal is full programmatic control and an automated monetary policy. Management of Protocol reserves and protocol controlled assets should be increasingly automated, and governance when necessary conducted via the current OIP system and by the upcoming on-chain governance system.\n\nDAO controlled assets are assets requiring active management or oversight, strategic assets and other non reserve assets. Use cases for these include incentivizing OHM adoption, growing protocol reserves or paying for services. Ownership of these assets are retained by the protocol but the management is proposed to be delegated to the Olympus DAO. DAO owned assets are assets fully owned and managed by the Olympus DAO intended for funding operations of the DAO.\nMotivation\n\nOlympus aims to establish OHM as the decentralized, programmatic reserve currency at the center of digital economies.\n\nA core aspect of OHM is steadily increasing levels of autonomy in the protocol core mechanics - including monetary policy, stability, and liquidity.\n\nThis proposal separates current assets into protocol reserve assets which are used in market operations and monetary policy, held directly in the Treasury, protocol controlled assets held by the protocol in secondary contracts, DAO controlled assets and DAO owned assets which are managed by the Olympus DAO to support protocol development, utility, education, partnerships, stability, and growth.\n\nThis will greatly increase clarity of what Olympus protocol reserve assets are, how they are used, how they are governed and reduce overall risk.\n\nProtocol reserve assets are managed by protocol mechanics. Protocol reserves should not be directly used to acquire additional strategic assets, fund DAO operations or other activities outside the scope of protocol mechanics. A goal is that protocol controlled assets are managed via autonomous smart contracts, negating any direct management at all.\n\nCurrent assets will be restructured, some will move from DAO control to protocol reserve assets and some will be moved to be management by the Olympus DAO as DAO controlled assets. The DAO is able to oversee vesting tokens in other protocols and is more agile to strategically manage assets according to goals of Olympus. Examples include incentivizing OHM adoption, attracting third party liquidity to OHM pools or benefitting from market inefficiencies.\nProposal\n\nDefine four parent categories of assets:\n\nProtocol Reserve Assets Protocol reserves, backing and assets used in core protocol mechanics E.g. DAI, ETH, OHM-LP Protocol Controlled Assets Controlled by the protocol in secondary contracts. E.g. Flex Loan collateral, reserves in yield bearing protocols aDAI, LUSD in stability pool DAO Controlled Assets Strategic assets, strategic positions in other protocols, protocol service fees, other tokens. Controlled by Olympus DAO. E.g. CVX, ,CRV, AURA, BTRFLY DAO Owned Assets DAO owned OHM for the purpose of coordination of operations OHM\nGeneral Principles\n\nProtocol Reserve Assets are managed by core protocol mechanics. Fees and rewards in other tokens should automatically swapped back to increase the reserve assets (e.g. rewards from LP positions). Reserve assets should not be withdrawn for other use than core protocol mechanics.\n\nProtocol Controlled Assets are assets under protocol control or protocol custody from other Olympus products and services, e.g. Flex Loans. Protocol Controlled Assets should be programmatically managed. Excess protocol reserve assets can be deployed to secondary functions or protocols to earn extra yield but should prioritize low risk and fully automated management. Where possible excess reserves can also deployed to support the protocol they originate from (e.g. LUSD deployed to LUSD stability pool, with automatic conversion back to new LUSD if triggered).\n\nDAO Controlled Assets are all other protocol owned assets that are controlled by the Olympus DAO. Management of the assets are delegated to the DAO according to the treasury management frameworks. Management is performed to support the current active strategy approved by the community.\n\nDAO Owned Assets are assets owned by the DAO to fund its operations.\n\nReset current Treasury Frameworks. Going forward, Olympus on-chain governance implies that each individual change to Protocol Reserve Assets and Protocol Controlled Assets are managed via on-chain governance proposals.\nTreasury Restructure\n\nAs part of this proposal, all current assets are to be reorganized into the four categories defined above.\n\nDeploy a new treasury contract and stepwise migrate Protocol Reserve Assets to this contract.\n\nAfter the restructure, there will be one main treasury contract holding a limited set of Protocol Reserve Assets and a set of contracts for Protocol reserve assets. These will be clearly listed in the Olympus documentation.\n\nDAO controlled assets will be held by a DAO treasury contract and/or multisig, and eventually sub contracts and multisigs in order to facilitate operational speed. These addresses will also be clearly listed in the Olympus documentation.\n\nThe Olympus DAO should hold OHM to fund its operations, with the possibility to swap into other assets as needed to fund operations and pay for services. Current DAO OHM will be transferred into a new multisig.\nTreasury Framework Update\n\n    Resets the treasury frameworks OIP-20, OIP-51, OIP-54 and OIP-73A\n\n    Changes to any asset are handled on a per asset basis, all actions requires either an on-chain vote or a policy vote\n\n    No general framework for on-chain governed assets exist anymore (Protocol Reserve Assets and Protocol Reserve Assets), as these will be fully on-chain governed (where code is attached to the proposal).\n\n    Until the treasury restructure is done or on-chain governance is implemented, delegate moving current assets between categories, treasury contracts and multisigs and swapping any current asset into stables to policy votes.\n\n    The goal is however social consensus around Protocol Reserve Assets only being used for core protocol mechanics and growth of protocol reserves by conservatively deploying reserves into Protocol Controlled Assets to earn yield. Deployed reserve assets should be available at short notice (preferably next block).\n\n1) Categories are: Protocol Reserve Assets, Protocol Controlled Assets, DAO Controlled Assets and DAO Owned Assets\nImplementation\n\nStep 1: Finish ongoing and open treasury related OIPs\nTAP-15 100k USDC Bribe test - Use $100k in USDC to acquire strategic assets\nOIP-110 AURA/BAL acquisition\nDeploy new treasury contract\n\nStep 2: High level restructure between Olympus Treasury and Olympus DAO\n\nMove assets between the Olympus treasury and DAO to reflect the categories above. Assets in Protocol Reserves and Protocol Controlled are to be controlled by the treasury contracts and DAO Controlled Assets are to be controlled by the Olympus DAO.\n\nDevise a public plan and time schedule for assets that cannot be moved immediately.\n\nUpdate and restructure DAO holdings and assets.\n\nStep 3: Amend Treasury Frameworks (OIP-20, OIP-51, OIP-54, OIP-73A)\n\nAmend all previous treasury frameworks with the new Treasury Framework. All changes to assets going forward will use the new treasury framework, and require either an on-chain governance vote or a policy vote.\n\nStep 4: Launch Range Bound Stability\n\nRange Bound Stability should be launched before the next step\n\nStep 5: Write allocators and automate asset strategies\n\nGo over current allocators and write (automated) strategies for reward accrual into base assets. Migrate to new allocators where needed.\n\nStep 6: Update Olympus website treasury dashboard, documentation and subgraph\n\nUpdate the treasury dashboard to focus on Range Bound Stability visualization and protocol reserves.\n\nUpdate the documentation and subgraph to reflect changes.",

      "title": "OIP-120 : Abachi Flex Loans Whitelisting",
      "content": "# Summary\nWhitelist Abachi for usage of the Flex Loans facility that would allow us to bootstrap an ABI/OHM pool.\n\n# Background\nAbachi is a longer term bet on the convergence of DeFi and TradFi. We are currently building the middleware and tools that real-world businesses can use to leverage DeFi. Both permissioned and permissionless.\n\nWe aim to be somewhat like what plaid (plaid.com) is for the real world. Our middleware allows our partners to connect their existing financial software (starting with accounting software) and issue risk and loan terms based on those.\n\nWe do not issue the loans, however we build the tools that allow lenders and borrowers to access these markets using bonds.\n\nWe have currently 180k USD lent out in short-term 4 month loans via our permissioned partners in a pilot program and we aim to grow this 10x each year. The permissioned bonds market is currently in testing in ropsten and will be launched on Ethereum in the next couple of weeks.\n\nOnce the first bond markets are launched for real world loans, our next milestone is to integrate a digital wallet into our partner apps to allow end to end transactions in digital assets.\n\nWith this said, we are bridging ABI to Ethereum (from polygon) and this bridge is now live on multichain app. We would like to launch an LP against the OHM we currently hold (40 gOHM).\n\nThe LP will be offered only against an OHM pair on Ethereum chain until we feel demand requires other pools to be launched. Our main LP is on polygon for ABI/DAI.\n\nOnce the initial pool is launched we would also like to work with Olympus for LP bonds and incentives to this pool.\n\nAs a project that is bullish OHM we feel this is the primary use case for OHM and hope the community will get behind it so we can make this LP launch a success.\n\nOnce the loan is approved we will consult with the Olympus team on where to launch the LP. Either Balancer or Sushiswap is under consideration at the moment.\n\n# About ABI Token\nThe ABI (abachi) token is a governance and utility token that rebases at an APY 1/3rd of OHM. Currently 60% but dropping to 5% soon.\n\nABI is used for:\n\n1. Fees paid for multi-chain transactions.\n\n2. Fees paid to KYC & Onboard lenders and borrowers to our platform.\n\n3. Fees paid on loan and bond transactions using our tools.\n\nABI has a treasury that holds USD, BTC, ETH and OHM. The aim of this treasury is to provide liquidity for ABI to trade against and currently its ~USD 1m with 296,000 outstanding circulating supply. This treasury is not used for operational expenses. As the protocol grows the digital assets will be used to shore up liquidity and provide price stability to the token.\n\n# TL;DR\nOur mission is to disrupt the 8.1T credit and treasuries (bonds) markets, the 6.6T forex market, and the 29T cost of trust.\n\nSome of the building blocks to achieve this mission are:\n\n- Multi-chain wallet that can be integrated by third-party app developers inside their apps via an SDK.\n\n- Build B2B KYC as a service. Offer the solution as a plugin to our wallet, and enable business identity on a per wallet basis.\n\n- Launch permissioned bond markets. Abachi can buy a 30yr bond at market, then if ever needed, sell it back after holding it for a year, or swap it for a 10yr bond.\n\n- Culminate all this tech to enable permissioned Buy-Now-Pay-Later solutions for businesses at scale.\n\nBusinesses can apply for the permissioned lending service. They will:\n\n- go through a business KYC,\n\n- be analyzed & assigned a risk rating based on their (and their specific market’s) financial situation,\n\n- Assigned a KYC’d wallet within their financial app (Quickbooks, Xero, etc.)\n\n- They can collateralize their future earnings to get access to liquidity today at a fixed markup.\n\n# Terms:\n## Flex Loans\nWhitelist Abachi for usage of Olympus Flex Loans with the following initial conditions:\n\n- LTV: 100%.\n\n- Debt limit (max borrowable amount): 25k OHM.\n\n- Interest rate: 0%.",

      "title": "OIP-119: OHM Bonds and Emissions Framework Launch Plan",
      "content": "## Summary\nA formalized, four-phased approach to launch OHM bonds, which requires a new emissions framework. The first phase, which has already been voted on and started in OIP-114 Tantalus, is to soft launch OHM bond trials. The second phase is to set a fixed, lower system base rate to prepare for OHM bond launch and Olympus V3. The third phase is the full launch of OHM bonds. Finally, the fourth phase will be the launch of a dynamic and automated base rate framework.\n\nThis proposal is to align on the full vision, and to vote on Phase 2 of the launch plan:\n\n### Phase 1 [vote passed]:\nTrial period of OHM bonds - see more info here: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1328-oip-114-tantalus-testing-ohm-bonds\n\n### Phase 2 [to vote on now]:\nReplace the current emission framework with a simpler framework that serves as the base rate for OHM bonds and supports price stability in a low-growth market environment.\n\n### Phase 3 [to vote on later]:\nFull launch of OHM bonds. A third OIP will be created prior to launch with complete implementation details regarding initial capacities, tenors, and lessons learnt from Phase 1.\n\n### Phase 4 [to vote on later]:\nSet a new dynamic base rate, based on feedback from Phase 2 and Phase 3. This rate will be fully automated in line with the future On Chain Governance and Bophades upgrades.\n\n## Motivation\nThe main priority of Olympus V3 is to strengthen the stability of OHM, encourage OHM adoption with protocols and DAOs and build OHM denominated liquidity (in line with OIP-118 The Olympus 2022 Strategy). OHM bonds will be one of the first functions of Olympus V3 to launch, so it makes sense to update the emissions framework at the same time. OHM emissions are the foundation of the protocol and need to be improved in the following ways:\n\nThe emission framework should support stability in different market environments The supply-based emissions framework currently in use is no longer a useful metric for supply expansion. Protocol emissions are a key function long term to stabilize OHM by matching the growth of the protocol. However, the current emission framework assumes that the protocol is growing faster than it actually is, and the current reward rate is too high to be “real” growth in the current market conditions. In the current framework there’s no way to adjust the rate lower. Instead, high supply expansion leads to inflation which leads to less stability over time.\n\nFramework should be compatible with RBS When inverse bonds are active, and at the lower bounds of Range Bound Stability a high reward rate directly hurts the effectiveness of these mechanics.\n\nFramework should be compatible with OHM bonds At the same time, Olympus is preparing a number of protocol upgrades that will redefine protocol emissions. OHM bonds as voted on in OIP-114 is the first protocol upgrade that will impact how Olympus releases OHM into the market. Going forward, protocol emissions will start to be directed where there is a tangible extra benefit. **The reward rate should function as the foundational “base rate” for OHM bonds to build a proper yield curve on top of.\n\nFramework should allow development of upcoming credit markets** Rebases are growth-biased, and when the protocol is not growing, its just inflation that don’t go towards productive economic activity. High rebases prevent lending avenues from scaling, and prevents (upcoming) credit markets from functioning at all.\n\n### Proposal\nAuthorize the Policy team to:\n\n- Deprecate the current supply-based framework voted on in OIP-18, in favor of a simpler and more appropriate metric for establishing a base rate of OHM expansion.\n- The new metric is proposed to be a 5% spread above the current 1-year stablecoin rate of return (DAI and USDC average), which results in a 7.35% Annualized Rebase Rate (ARR) or 0.006477% reward rate. Data arriving at this number are in Implementation Details below. This fixed reward rate will be set over a one week transition period.\n\n## Proposed benefits\nUsing a small spread above a trailing stablecoin rate allows for the base rate of OHM expansion to be competitive to stables, while also low enough to permit protocol lending activities at scale.\n\nFurther, a low reward rate allows the Range Bound Stability module to operate optimally during times of low demand. If implemented today, RBS would constantly struggle against the pressure that a high reward rate puts on it during a stagnant protocol growth phase. In keeping the reward rate low, RBS is freed from that burden without negative consequences.\n\n## Implementation Details\n### How to determine stablecoin rate of return?\nUSDC and DAI historical rates. 1 year Aave average rate at 2.44% and 2.27% respectively on 9 Sep 2022.\n\nThe technical complexity of implementing an automatically adjusting rate seems unnecessary given a yearly average is used. The proposal is to stay with a fixed rate until OHM bonds and Range Bound Stability are launched and can be included in a broader emission framework.\n\nIt’s important to set a base rate for the Olympus system for use in lending markets and the coming OHM bonds. Choosing a 5% rate above the stablecoin rate of return gives OHM a competitive advantage over other stable options, while approaching a more sustainable “real” return. There’s little gain in going higher for now, and the risk is to keep overinflating relative to network growth.\n\n### How to change the reward rate?\nIn order to adopt the fixed rate framework, the reward rate will be adjusted over a one week period to the target of 0.006477%.\n\n### How to prepare to launch OHM bonds?\nThe launch of OHM bonds is dependent on Phase 1 (Tantalus - OHM bonds trial) and Phase 2 (set base rate) as described above to conclude. After this, Olympus DAO can prepare the Phase 3, the full launch of OHM bonds. Olympus DAO will monitor the performance of the different bond tenors, auction styles and other feedback. Finally, in Phase 4 a new fully automated, dynamic base rate will be introduced.",

      "title": "OIP-94B: Inverse Bond Framework Approval",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nSince the first inverse bond Olympus DAO has iterated on the framework by which new bond markets are created. This proposal seeks community approval of that framework. This framework will continue to be used to create new bond markets for the remaining duration of OIP-94A.\n\nThis proposal seeks approval to repurpose the purchased OHM through Inverse Bonds to be used for lending, credit, DAO swaps with partners and automatic market operations (AMO) in general. While the first approach was to burn, and when needed re-mint, after speaking with counsel and iterating further we adapted the model and will be keeping the tokens in the DAOs balance sheet.\n\n## Definitions\n\nNet Market Activity: Net of the dollar value of all buys and sells within protocol owned liquidity\n\nOrganic Flows: Difference between net market activity and bonds sold during the same period. This should allude to market activity beyond what may have been influenced by bond markets. Ex: -$100k Net market activity (more sold than purchased in LP) - $150k inverse bonds sold = -$250k organic flow\n\nOrganic Flows 7 day EMA: A 7 day exponential moving average of organic flows.\n\nLiquid Backing: Value of those assets in the treasury that can be immediately liquidated, if required.\n\nFloating Supply: Quantity of outstanding OHM not owned by the protocol.\n\nLiquid Backing per Floating Supply: Liquid Backing / Floating Supply\n\nDiscount to Liquid Backing: The % difference between Ohm’s market price and the Liquid Backing per Floating Supply.\n\n## Market Configuration\n\nCalculations for new bond markets will be prepared on Wednesdays and markets closed and created on Thursdays. Markets will be created with the following parameters.\n\nMarket duration:\n\nThursday to the following Friday (expected to be closed on Thursday. Extra day is for a buffer)\nIntra-week bond market creations that are not 1 day markets should end at the same time as existing markets\nBCV Tuning: Never\n\nAsset: DAI\n\nDeposit Interval and number of markets to create\n\nDeposit interval is fixed at 10 hours\n\nWhen total capacity for all markets is less than $300k then 1 market should be created\n\nWhen total capacity for all markets is greater than $300k then 2 markets should be created. The first market's capacity should be $150k. The second market's capacity should equal the remaining capacity.\n\n## How capacity is determined\n\nThe Inverse Bond framework utilizes the current market discount to liquid backing when sizing capacity for new bond markets. There are three scenarios which determine how new bond market capacities should be calculated.\n\nDiscount to liquid backing ≤ 10% or above backing and at or below 120-moving average\n\nBond capacity is equal to the amount of spending required per day to reach the current 120-day moving average over 30 days or the number of days until the official Ranged Bound Stability (RBS) launch.\nDiscount to liquid backing >10% and ≤25% and at or below 120-moving average\n\nBond capacity is equal to the amount of $DAI required per day to reach the current 120-day moving average over 30 days or the number of days until official RBS launch - Organic Flows 7 day EMA.\n\nTLDR: $DAI required - Organic Flows 7 day EMA\n\nCapacity should be limited to a maximum of 2x the amount of spending required per day to reach the current 120-day moving average.\n\nExample:\n\nOn June 1, the 120-day moving average was $34.3 requiring an expenditure of $8.25m over 54 days left to reach it, $152.5k per day.\n\nOn June 1, Organic Flows 7 day EMA was -$190k per day.\n\nTo reach target net market activity, the organic outflow would need to be counteracted along with an additional $152.5k\n\nTotal capacity calculated $152.5k - -$190k = $342.5k, however this is greater than the 2x maximum of $305k. New total market capacity will be $305k per day.\n\nDiscount to liquid backing >25% and at or below 120-moving average\n\nA one day bond market should be added, increasing capacity by the $DAI amount required to get back to a liquid backing discount of ≤25% - Organic Flows 7 day EMA.\n\nTLDR: $DAI required to reach discount - Organic Flows 7 day EMA\n\nExample:\n\nLiquid backing per floating Ohm is $14.35. A discount of 25% is $10.76. Current Ohm market price is $10, a 30% discount.\n\nRealizing a discount ≤25% would require at least $1.1m DAI added to XYK pools, given current liquidity of $63m\n\nOrganic Flows 7 day EMA is currently -$567k\n\nNew 1 day market capacity: $1.1m - -$567k = $1.67m\n\nCalculated bond market capacity changes must be greater than a $30k difference to warrant re-issuing markets.\n\n## When are intra-week Capacity Changes Considered?\n\nBond market capacities are calculated weekly. However, there are instances where a change in capacity intra-week may be required.\n\nThe discount to liquid backing exceeds 25%: in this case a 1 day bond market that increases capacity is required\n\nExisting bond markets run out of capacity early\n\nOrganic Flows 7 day EMA at time of launch vs now have diverged by more than +/- $300k. At this time new bond market(s) with updated capacity will be launched\n\nExample: Day of market launch the organic flow 7 day EMA is -$500k. Two days later the outflow increases to -$800k.",

      "title": "OIP-117: Olympus Vision and Guiding Principles",
      "content": "*(Compiled by the Strategy task force, based on Community feedback since inception)*\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to refine the highest level vision and guiding principles for Olympus, while also introducing a strategy that’s meant to focus efforts and resources to help optimize growth in the short to mid term.\n\nThe vision and fundamental principles described below are meant to be stable and change infrequently. The strategy presented in a parallel proposal is constantly reevaluated and should be reviewed at least every six months, as the nature of strategy work and opportunities means that strategy should be adaptive.\n\n# THE VISION \nEstablish OHM as the decentralized, programmatic reserve currency at the center of digital economies.\n\n## What do we mean?\nDecentralized means that Olympus is community governed, where no single entity has sole governance control and the protocol is not dependent on any single person to function or progress.\n\nA currency is a standardization of money in any form, in use or circulation as a medium of exchange, for example banknotes, coins and digital currencies. Currencies may act as stores of value and be traded on exchanges, which determine the relative values of different currencies. \n\nA number of traits define a reserve currency: ref deep liquidity, non-permissioned exchange to other currencies and stability towards assets and goods. A currency can be defined as \"reserve\" when it is held by other monetary authorities and institutions as a reserve. \n\nWithin a DeFi context, a reserve currency is:\n- a default trading pair on decentralized exchanges\n- freely lent and borrowed on money markets, serving as robust collateral\n- utilized to settle derivatives\n- held by protocol treasuries and individuals alike as a safe haven \n\nDigital economies expand beyond DeFi and crypto into the global, everyday economy enabled by the internet and digital business models.\n\n## Why OHM?\nBTC and ETH are sound commodities, whose respective economics and designs encourage saving and speculation at the expense of investment and spending. Pegged stablecoins have found product market fit in the current DeFi landscape, but suffer from imposed monetary policy and the tradeoffs between scalability and decentralization.\n\nOHM seeks to fill a gap in the market for a crypto-native currency that is useful as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value at scale. \n\nOHM is a floating currency managed by transparent, algorithmic and market-driven monetary policy, powered by the Olympus treasury, and governed by OHM holders. \n\nThe protocol is a decentralized autonomous monetary authority, serving the needs of stakeholders by ensuring liquid markets, fostering stability, and promoting velocity. \n\nThe protocol has the flexibility (floating) and power (treasury) to make OHM the most liquid and ubiquitous asset, starting in DeFi, extending to the broader crypto ecosystem, and finally to be at the center of digital economies.  \n\n## How OHM?\nIn physics, Ohm is a unit of electrical resistance. At scale, OHM the currency is allowed to float with resistance from the protocol’s key monetary policy levers: algorithmic direct intervention and rates. \n\nThrough its early growth phase, Olympus bootstrapped a treasury composed of protocol owned liquidity and reserves that together represent a budget for algorithmic open market operations implemented as the Range-Bound Stability (“RBS”) module. \n\nNext to algorithmic direct intervention, rate policy is the other key pillar of monetary policy. Interest rate policy will be carried out in OHM lending markets where the treasury can dynamically inject liquidity into collateralized debt positions, under collateralized credit accounts and liquidity pairs, among others. Also included under the umbrella of rates is the OHM emissions rate for staking and bonding, which align holders with the growth of the protocol. Both interest and emissions rates help to reinforce RBS by incentivizing stakeholder behavior and managing supply.\n\nLastly, decentralization through on-chain governance ties together the actions of the protocol and the direction provided by the OHM token holders. The protocol obtains its authority from the community, ensuring that those who are participating in the economy guide the implementation of changes in a transparent and fair manner.\n\n## Guiding Principles for Olympus Development and Governance \n*The guiding principles define the goal of Olympus, the entities and the highest level governance system.*\n\n1. The goal of Olympus protocol is to create a decentralized reserve currency and monetary policy using smart contracts.\n2. The Olympus protocol aims to be fully codified, with direct on chain governance responsible for protocol updates.\n3. Community proposals are published and discussed on the Olympus forum before being voted on. \n4. OlympusDAO is the Decentralized Autonomous Organization that facilitates protocol development, utility, education, partnerships, stability, and growth. \n5. OlympusDAO is overseen by the Olympus community and strives for transparency, integrity, excellence and trust. \n6. The Olympus community delegates OlympusDAO oversight to the Olympus Governance Council.\n7. These guiding principles will evolve over time and are changed by two community votes at least 30 days apart with quorum defined by on-chain governance.",

      "title": "OIP-118: The Olympus 2022 Strategy",
      "content": "*(Compiled by the Strategy task force, based on Community feedback since inception)*\n\nThis proposal builds on and synthesizes previous community efforts on strategy, including early discussions and collaboration held in discord by the community, the Olympus12 plan, comments from community calls and the RFC forum post. The strategy is meant to focus efforts and resources to help optimize growth in the short to mid term.\n\nThe **vision** and fundamental principles described in a parallel post are meant to be stable and change infrequently. The **strategy** in this proposal is constantly reevaluated and should be reviewed at least every six months, as the nature of strategy work and opportunities means that strategy should be adaptive.\n\n## What is strategy?\n> “Good strategy almost always looks simple and obvious in retrospect… It identifies the one or two critical issues in a situation—the pivot points that can multiply the effectiveness of effort—and then focused and concentrated action and resources on them” - Richard Rumelt\n\nThe core idea of strategic work is to enable strong focus on key issues.  At Olympus it should lead to measurable outcomes. Olympus is a mission-driven project, which means strategy is built around short-term actions that are highly impactful on the long-term mission.\n\nThe structure of the strategy proposed is Diagnose -> Guiding Policy -> Coherent Action. This means it starts with identifying key challenges or problems, then defining a high level guiding policy and finally specifying a number of identified actions that will address the key challenges.\n\n## Why strategy at Olympus?\nOlympus and OlympusDAO have evolved much over the last 18 months. As the initial launch and expansion phase is over, there is a need to align effort and work towards a few set goals. Not everything can be done at the same time. \n\nThe nature of the DAO is that all contributors, and the community at large, are spread around the globe. Everyone should be able to get daily guidance on priorities from the strategy, without need for lengthy alignment discussions.\n\nAdditionally, the DAO has identified a set of OKRs, and the strategy should align with the OKRs in order to measure outcomes at the end of the year. \n\n## The Olympus 2022 Strategy\n### Diagnosis\nOlympus aims to establish OHM as the decentralized, programmatic reserve currency at the center of digital economies.\n\nA reserve currency can be defined by [ref](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-reserve-currency-1978926)\n- Depth and liquidity to allow for reliable and efficient transactions\n- Permissionless and easy exchanged for other currencies\n- Being held by many monetary authorities and institutions, in significant amounts\n- Maintaining stability with low volatility towards other currencies, assets and goods\n- Establishes markets for financing via credit and debt instruments\n\nTwo key unaddressed challenges for Olympus to grow as a reserve currency are:\n1. significant adoption by other protocols, DAOs, and DeFi institutions (demonstrating utility to the DeFi ecosystem at the same time) and\n2. demonstrating increasing relative stability over time.\n\n## Guiding Policy\nOlympus will focus on addressing the two key challenges identified above, both of which are largely under Olympus’ control: drive adoption with DeFi DAOs and protocols, and demonstrate increasing stability over time.\n\n**Adoption and utility:** Build OHM reserve currency status by focusing on uptake as a reserve with DeFi protocols and DAOs. Encourage adoption by providing direct benefits for protocols and DAOs that onboard OHM as a long term treasury asset and liquidity pair.\n\n**Stability:** Increase stability and lower volatility over time by implementing Range Bound market operations and a clear Treasury management process. Reduce required trust by implementing a transparent, codified monetary policy and governance system.\n\n## Coherent Actions\n### Adoption (via utility)\nProvide a clear value proposition to DeFi protocols and DAOs\n\n1. Increase OHM adoption by focusing on Flex Loans and other liquidity products via DeFi services to drive adoption amongst DeFi protocols\n- Align all Olympus work groups around Olympus Flex Loans adoption \n- Develop use cases and user journeys that integrates Olympus and partners (e.g. Bond Protocol)\n- Establish a customer research process to inform product development and needs in the market, a partner funnel, and standardized protocol review framework\n\n2. Increase utility from emissions Ensure that protocol emissions are used for maximum protocol benefit\n\n- Evaluate gOHM vs vaults\n- Framework for mint & sync to OHM pools (to attract third party LPs) \n- Framework for mint & sync to Flex Loan partners that offset negative effects from Olympus monetary growth\n\n3. R&D efforts to build products, features or services that drive utility and adoption\n\n- Evaluate generalized lending market implementations\n- Evaluate an Institutional OHM offload facility\n- Identify potential markets that can be be OHM denominated (e.g. NFTs)\n\n### Stability (via monetary policy)\nIncrease autonomy and transparency of the monetary policy,  aim for stable growth of monetary supply and reducing volatility\n\n1. Launch Range Bound Stability v1\n- Deploy v1 to test and evaluate parameters and demonstrate increased stability of OHM\n\n2. Launch Internal (OHM) Bonds \n- Define core design goal of internal bonds \n- Tie into Emission Framework and define rollout implementation\n\n3. R&D efforts to improve and simplify the monetary policy and protocol mechanics\n- Evaluate Range Bound Stability with TWAMMs\n- Evaluate simplified RBS\n\n4. Align communication, protocol phase, and position - Olympus is in stable growth phase (after launch, before stability)\n- Designate the main long term OHM token (OHM vs gOHM)\n- Redefine protocol/user personas and core mechanics (3,3 9,9 etc)\n- Emphasize positioning vs fiat currencies and core protocol values\n- Provable autonomous monetary policy, provable reserves\n- Transparent, decentralized, community governed\n- Aim to reduce volatility while reducing market operations over time\n- Develop the underlying OHM based economy in DeFi, e.g. LP with other assets\n- Communicate that reserves and price are not 1:1. Move away from using the term backing\n- Reduce market operations over time while maintaining relative stability\n\n### Stability (via transparency and trust) \nIncrease stability through clear governance and transparency\n\n1. Launch on-chain governance\n- Launch on-chain governance v1 and evaluate\n- Propose delegation structure based on on-chain governance system\n- Framework for community voting\n- Framework for delegation to multisigs\n- Evaluate delegation to DAO/sub-DAO\n- Evaluate separation of Reserves and Strategic Assets\n\n2. Evaluate protocol separation of backing assets and strategic assets\n- Evaluate restructuring of protocol and DAO assets, DAO OHM reserve size and OHM minting to DAO\n- Protocol - reserve assets and LP\n- DAO - strategic assets, OHM reserve\n- Evaluate using strategic assets to short term incentivise OHM adoption (e.g. incentivize Flex Loan usage), sustainably fund the DAO long term\n- Evaluate gamification of strategic asset rewards\n- Propose Reserve and Strategic assets framework\n- Reserve assets managed by community vote\n- Community vote to delegate strategic assets management to the DAO",

      "title": "OIP-114 Tantalus - Testing OHM Bonds",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nGrant Policy authority to:\n\n- Deploy test of OHM Bonds via Gnosis Auction and Olympus Bonds to collect market data and community feedback\n- Source the OHM token incentives from OHM captured by Inverse Bonds activities to prevent additional emissions\n- Determine the parameters of the bond offerings: auction method, maturity lengths, date issued, capacity and max payouts\n\n## Background\n\nThis proposal aims to gather market data on the demand for OHM bonds as we design and transition to a bond centric future for the Olympus protocol. These ideas are established in more depth in “Exploring a Bond Centric Future” and “Olympus12”. The proposal also references Inverse Bonds from OIP-94 as the source of OHM tokens to be used for incentives of these bond offerings. This is to prevent additional emissions while undergoing bond testing.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe goal will be to understand the market demand for OHM bonds and analyze the relationship between discount rate and bond maturity by utilizing two different maturity lengths. Further analysis will also compare effects of net flows during unlocking events and compare observed discount rates against historical data. This testing and analysis will be important data to inform the development of the bond markets and the transition to a bond-centric Olympus protocol.\n\n## Implementation\n\nTest the auction methodology, using Olympus’s sequential dutch auctions and Gnosis auctions, to offer two bond maturities. Each bond offering will be tested with the different auction types. Therefore there will be two bonds with a maturity for 7 days and two with a maturity for 30 days. The allotted OHM for this test would be 40,000 OHM. Each bond will have a capacity of 10,000 OHM, which is approximately equivalent to the amount currently being bonded through Inverse Bonds daily and around 50% of the daily staking inflation. The bond tests will be divided into two rounds. Each testing the different maturities 7 day vs 30 day and using a different auction technique. There will be a delay between Round 1 and Round 2 to ensure demand has refreshed.\n\n*Note: The different auction types have different technical implementations. The Sequential Dutch Auction will have fixed term and the Gnosis Batch Auction will have fixed expiry.\n\n**Round 1**\n\nGnosis Auction: 14 day @ 10,000 OHM\n\nGnosis Auction: 28 day @ 10,000 OHM\n\n**Round 2: 1 to 4 weeks later**\n\nOlympus Auction: 14 day @ 10,000 OHM\n\nOlympus Auction: 28 day @ 10,000 OHM\n\nThis proposal aims to receive authorization for a Policy bond testing framework so that additional maturities, capacities or auction methodologies can be tested after the conclusion and review of this initial bond test offering.\n\n## Proposal\n\nAuthorize the Policy team to :\n\n1. Deploy test of OHM Bonds to collect market data and community feedback\n\n2. Source the OHM token incentives from OHM captured by Inverse Bonds activities to prevent additional emissions\n\n3. Determine the parameters of the bond offerings: auction method, maturity lengths, capacity and max payouts",

      "content": "Summary: \nAuthorize OlympusDAO to use a maximum of 100,000 USDC from the Treasury to bribe its Protocol-Owned Pools. \n\nMotivation: \nOlympus owns almost the entirety of its liquidity which puts the protocol in a good position to profit from token incentives emitted from various DEXes. Generating positive returns on bribes paid out would allow Olympus to generate additional income from its POL and use the proceeds to further reinforce the size of its Treasury. \n\nSpecifications: \nBribes could be conducted on various platforms (Hidden Hand, Votium etc.). \nBribes would mainly be used as a tool to acquire specific strategic assets more efficiently such as $BAL. \nDue to market volatility, there is always a risk that the value of the token emissions received does not make up for the bribe paid out. Policy will tightly manage this risk by accounting for large drawdowns in token prices when computing bribes profitability. \nOnce the test budget is exhausted and if results are positive, a formal OIP to establish a bribe strategy will have to be approved by the community. \n\nProposal: \n\nAuthorize OlympusDAO to utilize 100,000 USDC from the Treasury to fund bribes for its protocol-owned pools. Once the budget is exhausted, further deployment of Treasury funds would have to be community approved. ",

Acquiring governance power in that ecosystem would allow OlympusDAO to:\n\nParticipate in & Influence key Balancer governance decisions\n\nIncentivize external protocols to pair with OHM\n\nGenerate additional returns on POL\n\nWith Mint & Sync ready to be turned on and Olympus Flex about to launch, OlympusDAO is actively looking for ways to offer the most attractive package to protocols looking to establish liquidity for their token and Policy believes that the ability to control and direct $BAL emissions is another great tool to have in the toolbox.\n\nStrategic Focus\n\nAfter multiple months of discussing and collaborating with the Balancer team, OlympusDAO is confident that the Balancer DEX will keep innovating on the DEX front and continue shipping new features that will appeal to many protocols in the space.\n\nToday, 145,000 $BAL tokens are emitted weekly, of which, 90% are allocated to the various liquidity pools within Balancer. This represents $47M worth of incentives to be distributed to liquidity providers annually and which are currently being governed by veBAL/Aura holders.\n\nGovernance power in the balancer ecosystem can be acquired through multiple different tokens, however Policy proposes to only focus on $BAL and $AURA as means of governance acquisition. Given that Treasury wants to maximize veBAL controlled/ $ spent, it should be agnostic and acquire the most efficient token.\n\nProposal:\n\nOlympus to acquire governance power through $BAL (veBAL) and/or $AURA\n\nTokens to be acquired through direct market buys and/or Bribes and/or POL farming",

Note that this bounty is not available to Olympus contributors, who should contact the Bug Bounty Management team directly for a bounty if they have found a bug or inefficiency that is within Olympus’ codebase but outside of their mandate as a contributor. Further note that this bounty will not be awarded regularly. It is meant only for extremely high quality submissions which have significant material impacts to Olympus. No person submitting a bounty should assume that they are entitled to this or will be awarded it, as the bar to qualify for it will be very high.”\n\nAnd to approve its funding via the Treasury as needed.\n\n### Motivation\n\nIn the process of running the Olympus Bug Bounty through ImmuneFi, the Bug Bounty Management Team has received submissions which were high quality and of great use in improving Olympus’ codebase, but did not technically qualify for a Bounty under our existing tiers.\nIn order to provide incentive for coders both independent and within the DAO to continue making efforts to go above and beyond finding areas where the codebase can be improved, we propose adding a flexible ‘improvement tier’ to be awarded at the Bug Bounty Management team’s discretion.\n\n### Proposal\n\nAdd the aforementioned language to the ImmuneFi Olympus Bug Bounty program, and authorize the Treasury to make payments of up to $18,636.20 ($16,9420 * 1.1, as ImmuneFi charges a 10% fee for accepted submissions) not to exceed $55,908 monthly, on an as needed basis in order to award appropriate submissions.",

The terms of this partnership were:\n\na $2m DAO swap\n\nOlympus to take in FEI as a reserve asset\n\nFEI to take in OHM as a reserve asset, at a rate of 20% Olympus’ FEI holdings\n\nThe DAO swap was executed on March 22, $2m worth of each token based on a 30-day moving average (as stated in the proposal).\n\nOlympus executed a $50m purchase of FEI through the FEI-DAI PSM on May 12 at the urgent request of the FEI team due to concerns over FEI’s peg.\n\nA snapshot proposal ([FIP-107] was posted on May 21 and passed on May 24, recognizing the $10m obligation and assigning ETH as the asset to convert.\n\nOn June 13, it was made clear to Olympus contributors through a call with Tribe contributors that the $10m LBP would not occur due to changing views of PCV within the Tribe community (with a heightened emphasis on stablecoin reserves). This was met with understanding and taken in stride by the Olympus community.\n\nAt this point, the partnership was considered to be delayed indefinitely. Olympus unwound its FEI exposure between 6/14 and 6/17, swapping $50m FEI for $49.95m DAI through the FEI-DAI PSM.\n\nFEI Protocol reimbursed the $50k PSM fee on 6/29.\n\nProposal\nOur final step in concluding this saga is to unwind the TRIBE<>gOHM DAO swap.

OIP-55 stipulated that the grant program be run for a trial period of 3.3 months. The program was renewed by community governance as part of OIP-90 ([forum](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1145-oip-90-olympus-grants-program-further-3-month-approval/13), [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/olympusdao.eth/proposal/0x675a4acc6c9402b2269ea61a425c73b185ede2640a7aca11a1ba052eb5a2c050)) in early Q2 2022.\n\nSince launch, the Grants Working Group has successfully launched a reputable grants program. This can be seen via the active participation of thousands of individual community members in the OlympusDAO ecosystem round as part of Gitcoin’s GR13 alongside reputed protocols such as Uniswap and Polygon. Additionally we have seen 1,000+ OHMies participate in Grants Twitter spaces and various launch events.\n\nThe Grants program can benefit Olympus and OHM by helping to support aligned protocols that can drive OHM’s core mission of becoming Web3’s reserve currency and supporting key Olympus12 goals.\n\n### Optimizing operations in response to adverse market conditions\nThe dominating factor during Q1/Q2 2022 has been adverse market conditions. In response, the Grants Working Group has focused on reducing the cost of running the program whilst being able to maintain professionalism with existing partners and managing the admin of active interest in partnering with Olympus. In collaboration with Partnerships, the Grants Working Group has been researching setting up a legal entity to help with administrative aspects of coordinating agreements with external partners such as grantees. In addition the program is in the later stages of adopting more web3 tooling to make the administering of grants and the work of grantees more transparent and accessible for the community to engage with.\n\n### Ensuring a tight link between Grants activities and Olympus12 priorities\nAn additional focus of Grants has been to refine the grants pipeline to ensure all grantees under consideration fit within current priorities of the protocol. The Grants program has had requests for $10.75mm in funding across 69 unique applications. Over the last quarter 2 additional applicants have been identified as being within remit of current priorities of the protocol. These are:\n\n- **Artemis Academy ($50k):** This initiative is designed to activate builders with the appropriate training to develop OHM-centric products, services and applications. In addition, Artemis will use OHM as a unit of account by paying salaries, investments, revenue, and tuition in OHM. In addition to Grants Committee approval Artemis’ application was further successfully stewarded through community governance as part of OIP-101 (forum, snapshot).\n- **OHM-EPNS ($9k):** Will enable information and updates to be sent to OHM token holders directly to EPNS (Ethereum Push Notification Service)-enabled wallets. According to the EPNS documentation: “EPNS is a notifications protocol which enables users (wallet addresses) to receive notifications. Using the protocol, any dApp, smart contract or service can send notifications to users (wallet addresses) in a platform agnostic fashion (mobile, web, or user wallets).”\n\nEPNS will be immediately beneficial to the Olympus ecosystem, especially as we move towards on-chain governance.\n\n### Budget to date\nSince launching in early December 2021 the Grants program has been operating during an ongoing down trend in the markets. As such the USD value of OHM granted to the program via OIPs 50 and 90 has seen a significant decrease in value requiring various difficult negotiations and compromises to manage these facts.\n\n### Grants supported\n- On December 6th the community granted $1.5mm via OIP-50 (OGPv1) of which 164,083.48 USD was distributed. The remaining $1,335,916.52 worth of OHM remained in the DAO multisig.\n- OGPv1 committed to a total of $824,999.00 USD across 13 grantees.\n- On April 10th the community granted $1mm via OIP-90 which would cover the remaining $660,915.52 USD of obligations, new grants and operating costs for the program.\n- Over this period there was a further 50% drop in the market price of $OHM.\n- Due to these adverse market conditions the figure of $660,915.52 has been negotiated down to a total of $271,363.61 which will be paid out at a rate of $32USD per $OHM (the operating rate set by OIP-90) for grantees carrying over from OGPv1. This has the effect of a reduction in the USD value of the grants.\n- With Artemis ($50k) and OHM-EPNS ($9k) grants this puts remaining funds available to the program at ~80 gOHM.\n\n### DAO Contributors\n- For April the cost of paying contributors was $29,500\n- For May the cost of paying contributors was $23,500\n- For June the cost of paying contributors was $13,750\n\nThis puts the total cost for contributors to Grants at $66,750 which is a 47% reduction compared to previous OIP-50 operating costs.  This OIP seeks to adopt OIP-102 and to cap the operating budget of the Grants program to less than $20k per month making the program one of the cheapest Working Groups in the DAO.\n\n### Committee\nIn OIP-55 ([forum](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/540-oip-55-olympus-grants-program), [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/olympusdao.eth/proposal/0x015cb9276a34ae7ec7c00e4c780fcbd35d96f56e27e8d9b47b427daa2f0a63fc)) the voting process for the grants committee was enshrined as requiring 4 out of 7 seats voting for an applicant with no seats blocking the applicant. To better reflect the close working relationship between the partnerships and grants teams the grants committee proposes to change this governance framework to 5 of 8 with no seats blocking. The committee proposes to invite an additional 2 contributors from partnerships, expanding the committee from 7 to 8 with Apollo stepping down from the committee to focus on Council duties. The committee would now consist of Appleseed, Catwalk, Json, Kleb, Solarpunk and WollemiPine  with Glue (has been a contributor in the Partnerships team for the last year with extensive experience in the start up sector) and Stefano (has a background as a founder and working in VC, he is currently running our DAOs Operations and is part of the Partnerships team) as incoming committee members. Additionally the grants committee seeks authority from the community to nominate a delegate from within the Grants Committee to act as a delegate with authority to sign within any legal entities set up to serve the Olympus protocol. Nomination and withdrawal of a delegate to be governed with the same governance framework of 5 of 8 with no blocks.\n\n### Key Grants Q3 2022 Priorities\nDuring Q3 Grants will be focusing on projects that:\n- Help the community understand the impact of grantees on OHM’s core mission and priorities\n- Strengthen understanding and participation in governance (which will aid Olympus’ quest to become more decentralized and responsive)\n- Focus the Requests for Proposals infrastructure towards:\n\t- Decentralized frontends: Improves the robustness of core OHM operations\n\t- Business development and OHM integrations\n\t- Hackathons to produce the next generation of OHM-centric applications\n\n### Summary\n- Reduce overall Grants budget from $1mm USD of DAO owned OHM to $333k USD of DAO owned OHM.\n- Limit maximum grant size to $50k USD worth of OHM per project per quarter.\n- Change Grants Governance Framework outlined in OIP-55 from 4/7 with no blocks to 5/8 with no blocks.\n- Empower the Grants Committee to nominate a delegate from within the Grants Committee with authority to sign within any legal entities setup to serve the Olympus protocol. Nomination and withdrawal of a delegate to be governed with same governance framework of 5 of 8 with no blocks.\n- Fund Grants main multisig with $333k USD in DAO owned OHM from DAO multisig (OHM rate set at time of OIP-108 snapshot passing ([Time Weighted Average Price](https://dune.com/queries/395676) or similar)) within 7 days of OIP-108 Snapshot passing.\n- Reduce monthly budget cap by 66.66% (from $60k USD -> ~$20k USD per month) by funding Grants comp multisig from Grants main multisig with $80k of OHM over 3 instalments of $26,666 USD worth of OHM over 3 months to cover administration of the program with contributors compensated commensurate with the rates approved within the DAO.\n- Adopt OIP-102 to bring Grants Working Group compensation inline with The DAO to be covered either by Grants contributor budget or DAO main contributor budget.\n- Existing and new grants may be stewarded beyond the tenure of this OIP.\n- Unused funds in the Grants main multisig will be returned to the DAO multisig should the program not continue.\n",

      "content": "#### Summary\nDeploy the new system of Permissionless Olympus Pro contracts as an independent entity rebranded to Bond Protocol. By releasing Olympus Pro as its own protocol, OlympusDAO can focus on making OHM the decentralized reserve currency for Web3 and benefit from supporting the econOHMy. Bond Protocol will remain tightly aligned with OlympusDAO and include the same Olympus Pro contributing team.\n\n#### Proposal\nIf approved, the Permissionless OP contracts will be deployed as an independent entity and rebranded to Bond Protocol. Functionally this involves deploying the contracts with a different multisig authority, to be managed by 2 Olympus Core members, 2 OP members, and 1 external public figure.\n\nOff-chain, Bond Protocol will look and feel like a Web3 tech startup. On formation, Olympus will own a majority of shares (at least 60%). Olympus will also have a seat on the company’s board of directors. With a majority share and board seat, fundraising terms will require sign-off from Olympus prior to diluting its equity.\n\nFor the purpose of this proposal, the Olympus board seat will be filled by a member of the Council and represent the collective voice of the DAO.\n\nOlympus will use the newly formed Bond Protocol contracts for its bonds. This set of contracts are effectively Bonds v3, which have been developed with Olympus in mind as the largest customer. Importantly, there will be no fees charged for Olympus bonds deployed from Bond Protocol.\n\nThe initial deployment of Bond Protocol will include two types of bond markets:\n* Fixed-term bonds tokenized as ERC1155 NFTs (most similar to previous bonds)\n* Fixed-expiry bonds tokenized as ERC20, same expiry date makes bonds fungible\n\n#### Amendments\n\n##### OP Contracts & Revenue\n* Tokens accrued via OP to-date will remain with the Olympus Treasury\n* Existing OP contracts will continue to be owned by Olympus and revenue generated will accrue to the Olympus Treasury\n\n##### Structure\n* Any proposed share allocation at formation will be provided to Council for consideration and, if considered contentious, require further consultation with community governance\n* Following formation, the board will provide the Olympus board representative with at least 10 days' notice prior to consideration of a resolution for distribution of unallocated shares",

      "title": "OIP-101: Artemis Academy Grant Proposal",
      "content": "## Executive Summary from Grants Working Group\n\nThe Grants Working Group received an application from Artemis Academy (provided underneath this executive summary). Given the project is led by a member of the Olympus Governance Council it was agreed that in addition to the application passing through standard due diligence and Grants Committee vote there should be an OIP vote to give token holders final authority on whether to proceed with the Grant or not. Grants Committee quorum is 4/7. Grants committee members are Apollo, Appleseed, Json, Kleb, Solarpunk, Catwalk and Wollemipine. A summary of Committee voting and reasoning is as follows:\n\n- 5 voted for\n- 1 voted against\n- 1 no vote cast\n\n#### Summary of reasons for:\n\n- Strong alignment of the team with Olympus can help activate buildooors atop the econOHMy which is within grants remit. Opportunity for Olympus to get access to an interesting pipeline of potential early stage projects if/when appropriate and also developer talent.\n- Risk/reward ratio seems reasonable\n- Team seems prepared for execution in difficult markets\n\n#### Summary of reasons against:\n\n- Value add is too remote. Having cut costs within DAO, as many DAOs have, shortage of talent is not a problem and is not projected to be for some time.\n- Focus should be on builders building products that people can BUY with gOHM.\n- Ratio of Remain Grants Reserves\n\ngOHM rate at time of OIP-90 passing was $3,838.51USD. With current gOHM rate of $2,218.26 USD, 50k USD worth of gOHM would be approx 22.5 gOHM. This would be roughly 22.5% of the remaining Grants budget.\n\n#### Feedback from RFC\n\nThis proposal has been updated based on feedback from the RFC ([read in full here](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1222-rfc-artemis-academy-grant-proposal)) to incorporate information on founders and team members and also includes inclusion of milestones each area of proposed use of funds.\n\n## Summary from Artemis Academy\n\nLed by Wartull, Artemis Academy is built by the world’s premier Web3 veterans. We’re creating a top-tier, end-to-end educational program that not only teaches the next wave of Web3 talent, but also enables them to create the future of Web3 innovation.\n\n### Motivation\n\nThe vision for Artemis was germinated from within Olympus. Finding, attracting, and retaining top Web3 talent that not only performs, but also does so in an ethical manner has become extremely rare. The Olympus community, more, the entire DeFi and Web3 communities deserve better. The strength of any organization is determined by its people. Artemis’ mission is to run a challenging ‘Navy-seal’ type bootcamp that focuses on quality over quantity and instils an ethos around building with a long-term mindset and contributing to web3 in an ethical and meaningful way.\n\nArtemis’ goal is to promote the Olympus ‘econOHMy’ by educating, preparing, and funnelling the best web3 talent/ leaders to build. Whenever possible, we draw salaries, make investments in student startups - all denominated in OHM. We also plan to hold a significant portion of our reserves in OHM.\n\n### Background\n\nArtemis Academy is built by the world’s leading Web3 veterans. We’re creating a top-tier, end-to-end educational program that not only teaches the next wave of Web3 entrepreneurs, but also enables them to create the future of Web3 innovation.\n\nWe are a borderless, open source, open access, structured “education + investment” program. Artemis combines cohort-based online education for experienced engineers alongside an enhanced YC-type incubator for web3/DAOs, which invests in founders or places them to work inside top web3 organizations.

For example, should Artemis have a $30M valuation, 0.333% of our token supply will be sent to Olympus.\n\n### Value for Artemis Academy\n\nThrough Olympus’ community, members, and network:\n\n- Olympus may provide resources to improve the quality of Artemis Academy courses and student experience, for example:\n- Olympus may help create course materials (e.g. DAO building, community management, tokenomics, etc.).\n- Members of Olympus may guest lecture 2-3 ‘Crypto Talk’ sessions such as how Olympus was built, how its faced adversity and persevered; explaining OHM’s economic (3,3) theory, etc.\n\n### Olympus may provide a grant that:\n\n- sponsors students facing financial hardships and are unable to afford tuition\n- assists Artemis in building an open-source portal that hosts bootcamp lecture materials (open to the general public) in an effort to make web3 more easily accessible to everyone\n- Olympus may provide mentorship to students during and after bootcamps\n- Olympus may help promote Artemis to its community members and network to help drive potential: Students, Teachers, Partners\n\n### Proposed Use of Funds:\n\nOpen source portal: As mentioned, our goal is to facilitate the general public’s transition into web3. We intend to help with this transition by making our course materials open-sourced, and easily accessible. To realize this goal, we’ll need to allocate funds to developers to build a robust portal that hosts this information.\n\nEstimated spend: $16,665.5\n\n**Milestone:**\n\n- Launch of open source portal containing our introductory web3 presentation materials (Blockchain Introduction + Solidity Basics)\n- Enhanced portal go-live, includes recorded lectures and expanded knowledge base presentation materials\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n- Initial ‘MVP’ by July 4th\n- V2 (enhanced portal) October 2022 est\n- Admissions Platform: We view our admissions platform as a tool that not only helps us gauge and assess the best talent, but also a tool that can be used by anyone (even non-applicants) to test their mettle in web3 development. Our pre-work is challenging and we want to give everyone a shot at hands-on web3 learning in an open, easy to use environment.\n- Student Grants: Our goal is to create a borderless, open-access, educational platform. We do not want to deter any talent from participating in our bootcamps for financial reasons and will use part of the grant funds to cover tuition costs for any student facing financial hardship.\n\nEstimated spend: $16,665.5\n\n**Milestone:**\n\n- Sponsoring 6 students (total) to attend bootcamps for free\n\n**Timeline:**\n\n- Can be spread across September 2022 and January 2023 bootcamps.\n\n**Additional Milestones:**\n\nTimeline: October est.\n\n- Incorporation of Olympus content in our syllabus (e.g., Olympus guest lecturers, using OHM as the innovation cornerstone for aspiring new founders, building the ‘econohmy’)\n- Development of entrepreneurs familiar with OHM\n- Holding 20%+ of our funds in OHM and continuing to pay salaries in OHM\n- Developing a pipeline of educated and trained builders that bring utility to gOHM\n",

      "content": "Summary:\nSeek Authority from the community to establish compensation and bonus framework.\n\nMotivation:\nThe DAO has been operating under the framework introduced in stopgap budget proposal OIP-47A, since that time the DAO has added a governance council, and worked to reduce monthly spend. The stopgap budget proposal was never intended to be permanent, but allowed the DAO the bandwidth to flex and contract within the market demands of the time. Now we propose to adjust the framework, and add a longer term horizon and stability for contributors, so that the DAO can retain and reward contributors who help to push Olympus to its goals.\n\nBackground:\nHistorically there have been two schools of thought, both from within the DAO as well as from the community server:\n\nContributors are over allocated\n\nContributors are under allocated\n\nNo matter the plan that is presented, it is impossible for both groups to be fully satisfied. Therefore this proposal is based on months of effort with the aim of satisfying what makes the most logical sense, and keeping in mind what is best for the protocol’s overall health.\n\nGoals:\nThe aim of the plan is to induce stability and security for contributors, as well as for the protocol. Contributors want to forecast allocations, and budget accordingly. Likewise, the DAO benefits from being able to project out costs and expenses so that it can adjust when necessary and by retaining top contributors.\n\nIt’s important to note contributors are not employees, nor will they be, but will be acting as contracted members.\n\nFor more information, please consult the forum discussion:\n\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1231-oip-102-compensation-plan-with-bonus-structure\n\nVote:\n\nFor -  Implement the compensation plan and bonus structure\nAgasint - Do nothing\n",

      "title": "OIP-100: Adjust Reward Rate",
      "content": "Summary\nAdjust reward rate to 0.1186%, the minimum of the current range according to OIP-18, which translates to around 266% APY. This adjustment will be spaced out across 21 epochs, with the reward rate adjusting each epoch. The change will extend Olympus’ runway, improve protocol sustainability  and maximize the impact of Inverse Bonds, allowing Olympus to better manage potential lengthy bear market conditions.\n\n\nMotivation\n\nThe past few months have shown us a few things.\n\nFor one, Ohmies remain strong together. The number of staked OHM is still hovering around 80%, and inverse bonds are cushioning the market from irrational sells. The spirit of 3,3 has never been more important.\n\nSecond, the bear market may potentially extend over a multi-month to multi-year time frame. Our goal is to put Olympus and OHM in the best possible position to not only survive the bear market, but thrive. Part of this strategy is to calibrate the network’s growth rate to overall demand for OHM, in order to maintain healthy market conditions. The ideal balance for the market is for supply growth to closely track the growth of the ecosystem over the long term. In the stability phase of OHM, during times of low demand, supply growth should slow as well. A well-balanced emissions rate that tracks with demand for OHM has the following benefits:\n\n1. It makes market operations (specifically Inverse Bonds) more efficient\n2. It helps to dampen OHM volatility, which benefits OHM users (individuals, protocols and others), and makes OHM an attractive reserve asset\n3. It ensures that the protocol can continue to back and support each new OHM for years to come.\n\nTo that end, the DAO is working on an updated Reward Rate framework. Our goal with the new framework is to make reward rate adjustments more aligned with changing market conditions, overall OHM demand, and set up to be automated in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, Olympus DAO proposes a reduction in the current reward rate to the lowest end of the current rate tier. A lower reward rate at this time provides major benefits for the protocol.\n\nFirst, the Treasury will fight less against itself. Inverse Bonds effectively cushion the market and remove OHM from circulation. Emitting more tokens just after this operation works against that supply lever, so reducing the reward rate makes inverse bonds more effective long term.\n\nSecond, the protocol will emit fewer tokens during a time when OHM demand is lower. This adjustment will bump the runway to over 700 days. Further, it gives room to continue building the Olympus econohmy in 2022 in a sustainable manner, despite significant adverse macroeconomic headwinds. \n\nProposal\nAdjust reward rate to 0.1186%, the minimum of the current range according to OIP-18. That would be a 0.1186% reward rate, which translates to around 266% APY. The adjustment will be spaced out across 21 epochs, with the reward rate adjusting each epoch.\n\nFor additional context, be sure to read the previous reward rate proposals and their discussions:\n\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/755-oip-63-reward-rate-adjustment\n\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/77-oip-18-reward-rate-framework-and-reduction\n\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/37-oip-11-reducing-reward-rate",

      "title": "OIP-73A: Treasury Framework Amendment",
      "content": "This amendment is to provide clarity on what is considered a security/urgent matters as mentioned in the framework proposal’s 8th bullet point. A slight clarification is also brought to the 6th bullet point in regards to the ability to swap tokens received as farming rewards.\n\n    Treasury considers any events that put Olympus Treasury funds at risk of unexpected losses to be urgent matters. A stablecoin significantly losing its peg (+/- 5%) or having vulnerable assets on a protocol would be examples of urgent matters.\n\n    Swap/Sell tokens received as rewards (i.e. swap crv → cvx/dai/eth etc.)\n\nFull text with additions below:\n\nBackground:\n\nOlympusDAO has seen an outstanding growth in 2021 in terms of number of ohmies, number of partners, Protocol Owned Liquidity and more generally Treasury assets. Today, the Treasury is composed of hundreds of millions worth of assets waiting to be further utilized to help propel Olympus towards establishing as a central entity in defi.\n\nBecause DAOs are by definition decentralized, it’s important that the community has a say in all key decisions. At the same time, as a DAO grows and its operations become more complex, the community may wish to delegate minor or technical decisions to specialized teams, so that the average community member isn’t overwhelmed by relentless voting on matters they might lack the time, interest or technical expertise to carefully consider.\n\nOlympus is — and will always be — a community-run DAO in which key decisions affecting the protocol are made by the ohmies. The Treasury team exists to first propose strategies and opportunities to strategically utilize our assets. The team will then execute on any of the community’s decisions.\n\nFor any DAO, it can be hard to determine where to draw the line between decisions the community itself must make and decisions the community should delegate to its specialized teams. However, we think it’s crucial for the ohmies to clarify these rules now to maintain a healthy alignment of expectations among our growing community.\n\nSummary:\n\nAdopt a framework distinguishing (1) key treasury decisions and guidelines that require a community vote from (2) operational levers that the treasury team uses to implement community decisions, in which case the treasury team should act with autonomy.\n\nMotivation:\n\nOlympus is a community-run DAO in which key decisions affecting the protocol are made by the community. The treasury team implements the community’s decisions through a number of tools, the effective use of which often requires both speed and technical knowledge.\n\nOn the one hand, it is critical that the community is broadly aligned on key decisions. On the other hand, we believe it would be a mistake to require constant community votes on more technical questions, particularly when these technical questions arise in implementing decisions the community has already made.\n\nFramework Proposal\n\nWe propose adopting the table below as a general framework to clarify when the treasury team should take action to implement community decisions, and when it must seek specific authorization.\n\nBecause it is difficult to predict in advance every technical treasury issue that may arise, the following list is not intended to be exhaustive. Rather, it should serve as a living document to help everyone in the community understand how decisions are made.\n\nProposed Guidelines & Allocations limits\n\nTreasury is also proposing the following guidelines & allocations to the community. Those have been drafted using the Treasury framework presented above as a baseline. This table will supersede the framework presented in OIP-54.\n\n",

      "title": "OIP-99 - Provide Liquidity on FDT-ETH Pair",
      "content": "**Summary:**\nSupport Fiat DAO by providing liquidity on their Balancer FDT-ETH pool.\n\n\n**Background:**\nEarlier this year, Olympus formalized a partnership with Fiat DAO through OIP-72. As a result, a DAO swap was conducted between the two projects, making Olympus one of Fiat DAO’s top holders.\n\nInitially, Fiat used its OHM holdings to bolster liquidity for its FDT token by pairing with (g)OHM but encountered significant routing issues for multiple months, to the point where they finally moved their main liquidity pool to an FDT-ETH pair on Balancer.\n\n\n**Motivation**\nPolicy acknowledges that the infrastructure for partners to utilize OHM to provide liquidity is not perfectly in place today. Mint & Sync, Flex Loans, and Balancer boosted poolsare solutions that are currently being worked on and which Policy believes will greatly improve the attractiveness of OHM as a counter-asset for partner tokens.\n\nIn the meantime, as a show of good faith, Policy wishes to utilize a small fraction of its ETH resources to support a partner that has been closely aligned with Olympus since launching. This would increase the size of the FDT-ETH liquidity pool by $120k, which is a 55% increase in the pool size.\n\nA specific benefit to Olympus providing this critical liquidity is that staking the liquidity token will generate significant rewards APY via the Balancer liquidity mining program (currently 100 - 300%, though slightly lower if we were to provide liquidity).\n\nIn strengthening our alignment, we hope that once we improve the infrastructure to use OHM as a counter asset, FIAT DAO will reconsider moving its main liquidity pool to an OHM-denominated pair. This will be revisited at a later date.\n\n\n**Proposal:**\nBecome a liquidity provider on FDT-ETH Balancer pool by utilizing:\n\n1) 5.3M FDT, acquired through the DAO Swap and subsequently staking on FIAT DAO. An additional 5M is currently vesting.\n\n2) 20% of the amount in 1) in ETH. As of the time of forum post, this would represent using around $24 000 worth of ETH.\n\n3) Policy to reassess this position once suitable solutions for pairing with OHM are made available to partners.",

      "title": "OIP-97 - Cross-Chain EconOHMy Expansion Budget",
      "content": "RFC can be found https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1193-rfc-cross-chain-econohmy-expansion-budget\n\nBackground\n\nRoughly six months ago the Proteus programme was funded to facilitate the cross-chain expansion of Olympus. The intent of Proteus was not only to reach new users of other chains (that were often excluded due to Ethereum gas fees) but also to create new partnerships and integrations and develop use cases for the gOHM token.\n\nIn that time period Proteus has allowed us to:\n\n    Expand gOHM to Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom, Boba and Optimism.\n\n    Start the developments for a CosmWasm expansion.\n\n    Introduce Olympus to a new, wider audience through marketing, social media exposure, and AMAs with protocols on other chains.\n\n    Create gOHM price oracles on Arbitrum, Avalanche, Polygon, and Fantom - a necessary step for most integrations.\n\n    Support the cross-chain econOHMy and innovate cross-chain gOHM use cases, e.g. Dopex, Jones, Vesta, Thales, Rari, Market.xyz, Tracer, Impermax (and others in development).\n\nWhile the original Proteus budget was significant, the actual costs to run the programme turned out to be way lower than expected. This is partly because the expansions were strategic in nature, but also due to tight-knit partnerships with cross-chain DEXes who shared the burden of liquidity incentives (and stopping gOHM rewards when possible).\n\nOver these six months we have been extremely conservative with proteus rewards, spending a total of 222.6 gOHM - significantly below the $100m (at the time, approximately 5,000 gOHM) that was originally approved. A quick note; ~20 gOHM of the actual expenditure was used for a token swap with SpiritSwap, allowing for permanent liquidity on Fantom through gauge rewards.\n\nMotivation\n\nProteus was originally approved for a period of six months and this mandate is now coming to an end. The initial burst of cross-chain expansion has arguably been successful in nature as illustrated by the bullet points above. A large part of the value has also been intangible in nature, such as introducing Olympus to new audiences and building partnerships with protocols that are native to other chains.\n\nCreating a cross-chain expansion budget provides optionality to explore new opportunities and to develop new use cases for gOHM on other chains. At the same time, the learnings over the last few months have shown that we don’t need to spend significant amounts to pursue these objectives.\n\nIn this OIP we would like to propose a maximum budget of 50 gOHM/month - to be spent only when necessary. Those necessary actions are as follows: bootstrapping liquidity through gOHM incentives, doing minor DAO-to-DAO swaps, or funding other small but necessary expenses. More generally, this budget is to be used to fund and support the cross-chain econOHMy and gOHM use cases.\n\nPlease note that a key difference in this budget proposal vs. the original Proteus programme is that it’s focused on supporting and expanding the current cross-chain econOHMy rather than reaching new audiences or serving as R&D for cross-chain POL. This means, for example, that we will not be funding liquidity pools on new chains unless there are clear opportunities for gOHM use cases.\n\nDownsides\n\nThere are some natural drawbacks to cross-chain pools and use cases, such as increased cross-chain gOHM arbitrage and the potential risk of farmers selling liquidity incentives (in the case of gOHM liquidity mining). In our view these drawbacks are worth it to pursue and support more gOHM integrations and utility.\n\nProposal\n\n    Fund a new cross-chain expansion budget at 50 gOHM/month from DAO funds.\n\n    This budget is to be used to support and expand the cross-chain econOHMy and gOHM use cases. Note that this is an upper limit that allows for optionality in exploring new opportunities and partnerships, but that the budget won’t be spent unless we find those.\n\n    Run the new programme for a maximum of 6 months before re-evaluating and doing another governance vote.",

      "content": "Summary: Open a liquidity pool on Fraxswap to enable TWAMMs, strengthen alignment with Frax, and prepare for Atlantis.\n\nBackground: Olympus has a liquidity presence on Sushiswap, Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve. The protocol provides more than $140m in liquidity across pairs. The recently passed OIP-93 enables \"Mint & Sync\", which removes opportunity cost for LPs on XYK AMM pairs and allows third parties to participate as liquidity providers.\n\nFraxswap is a new AMM infrastructure created by Frax protocol. It features a consolidated router for xyk pools and stableswap, concentrated liquidity pools (both not yet live). It is the first AMM to introduce the Time Weighted AMM (TWAMM), a tool to smoothly execute large orders over time directly on the pool. Fraxswap will serve as the infrastructure for Atlantis, an upcoming DEX that is strongly aligned with the Olympus mission and vision; any pool deployed onto Fraxswap today can be added to Atlantis in the future with no further action.\n\nMotivation: Align closer with entities (Frax, Atlantis) seeking to strengthen and further the mission of Olympus. Expand the liquidity presence of OHM. Enable new policy tools and use cases with the availability of the TWAMM. Retain capital by escaping sushiswap fees.\n\nConsiderations: Migration of liquidity from a DAI pair on Sushiswap to a FRAX pair on Fraxswap. Short term liquidity fragmentation.\n\nImplementation Details:\n\nRemove 9.5m DAI and equivalent OHM from DAI-OHM pool, and add 9.5m FRAX and equivalent OHM to FRAX-OHM pool on Fraxswap.\nRemove (now redundant) FRAX-OHM pool on Uniswap V3.",

      "title": "OIP-93: Mint and Sync",
      "content": "Summary:\n\nEnable minting into liquidity pools to reduce emissions and dilution, and remove the opportunity cost of providing OHM liquidity.\n\nMotivation:\n\nTo: reduce cost (dilution) to the network; increase automation; increase predictability; decrease complexity; decrease time-sensitive interaction; better attract new liquidity providers and pairs.\n\nBackground:\n\nDue to staking emissions, providing liquidity for OHM is not an economically viable option for any third party barring high artificial incentives; a participant must earn more than they would staking to consider the activity worthwhile. As a result, the protocol serves as the basically sole LP for the token.\n\nOlympus currently owns more than 99% of the liquidity provided for OHM on Ethereum. OHM is currently growing in supply at a base rate of roughly 470% (0.1586% / epoch). It is important that liquidity grows at the same rate as supply (otherwise liquidity is diluted and thins over time); this is currently maintained through the issuance of LP bonds.\n\nDiscounts provided on bonds create dilution in the network which, while potentially beneficial to lock tokens, is inefficient from a purely utilitarian standpoint. A better solution provides this utility in an automated, protocol-facilitated and cost-minimized manner.\n\nImplementation:\n\nThe proposed implementation leverages the 'sync()' function present on xyk AMM pools to directly mint emissions into the LP (referred to as 'mint and sync'. This allows us to, on an automated basis, maintain consistency of liquidity and supply within the network.\n\nA good way to conceptualize this is as follows: imagine you hold OHM, and you are deciding whether to stake or to provide liquidity. You will earn 1 OHM per epoch if you stake, or you will forfeit that 1 OHM per epoch to provide liquidity but earn trading fees. Under this proposed structure, the 1 OHM you would be provided as a staker is still given to you as a liquidity provider; the only difference is, rather than receive tokens outright, they are added to your LP share. This removes your opportunity cost and puts the decision more in line with that of any other token on the market.\n\nConsiderations:\n\nThis structure requires a change in computation for staking rewards. Currently, staking emissions are calculated using the equation Emissions = Reward Rate x Total Supply. Here, this equation must be Emissions = Reward Rate x Circulating Supply. Since Total Supply > Circulating Supply, implementing this with no change to the reward rate will result in lower emissions in staking. Polling and voting will include separate choices; one contains no change to the reward rate, while the other adjusts the reward rate up to keep emissions constant.\n\n\n![Screen-Shot-2022-04-19-at-7-11-25-PM.png](ipfs://QmaRJNSdvpsfy9HUHkQDDxQX1foK2Bfc3sSoRASHxqcm5z)\n\nProposal:\n    1. Implement Mint and Sync with no change to reward rate.\n    2. Implement Mint and Sync with full adjustment to reward rate.\n    3. Do Not Implement Mint and Sync.",

      "content": "    abipup\n         \n    2 days ago\n\nSummary: \n\nGrant Policy Authority to:\n\n    Use inverse bonds above backing \n\n    Remove liquidity to facilitate efficient market operations\n\n    Add liquidity to reduce volatility as market cap grows\n\n    Burn OHM removed from liquidity \n\nBackground\n\nA few months ago, Policy released OIP-76 : Create Inverse Bond Policy Lever as a tool to be used in situations where OHM would be trading below liquid backing price on a per circulating supply basis. Recently, Zeus shared a new paper detailing how Olympus Treasury would be used to facilitate ranged-bound stability.\n\nRange-based stability is based on a historical moving average where the 120-day MA is around $102 as of 20 April 2022. Range-based guidance intends to use inverse bonds in the lower cushion, which we are certainly at right now.\n\nMotivation\n\nIt is in the interest of the Olympus ecosystem to start using its Treasury to conduct market operations, such as inverse bonds and adjusting liquidity, to encourage healthy market behavior.\n\nThe current situation presents a good opportunity to introduce one of the key components in the ranged-bound stability paper, inverse bonds, with the hope of having a full roll out of this new system in the medium term. That system is planned to operate around a long term moving average of price. In preparation for that system, the Treasury should act to meet a long term moving average now. We propose to use a 120 day moving average to start, which aligns with the proposed stability system.\n\nRather than simply using inverse bonds to support liquid backing, inverse bonds could be deployed to encourage the market price to meet the 120-day moving average. This would make the target price somewhere between the 120-day moving average and the current market price.\n\nWith a liquidity to market cap ratio currently above our target of 20%, there is room to pull this liquidity in order to reduce the capacity of inverse bonds needed.\n\nImplementation Details  \n\n    A target to meet the 120-day moving average\n\n    A limit of 90 days for running inverse bonds pending the implementation of range-based guidance \n\n    A capacity for inverse bonds with the goal of reaching the target price within 90 days\n\n    Target a liquidity to market cap ratio of 0.2  \n\n    Burning OHM that has been permanently removed from liquidity\n\n    Turn off inverse bonds once 120 day MA has been reached\n\nNote that these parameters will be monitored regularly by Policy and could change upon discovery of new data points.  \n\nProposal\n\nAuthorize the Policy team to : \n\n    Run inverse bonds above liquid backing price \n\n    Remove and add liquidity to meet targeted ratios \n\n    Burn remaining OHM after removing liquidity",

      "title": "TAP-11 Ribbon Finance Whitelist",
      "content": "Summary: Seek authority from the community to whitelist Ribbon Finance for depositing of reserve assets.\n\nBackground:  Recently the DAO has been accumulating additional ETH reserves assets such via OIP-15: Add ETH to the Treasury or wBTC via OIP-35: Add WBTC to the Treasury. The DAO is now seeking the ability to utilize Ribbon’s vaults for reserve assets to further increase the backing of OHM.\n\nMotivation: Whitelisting Ribbon Finance will allow Olympus to earn yield on reserve assets to help bolster the backing of OHM and grow the treasury. The DAO will adhere to the treasury framework of no more than 5% of excess reserve assets to riskier strategies in options vaults. However, this is just a limit and the DAO will assess the optimal distribution on a per asset per protocol.\n\nDescription from https://docs.ribbon.finance/: Ribbon Finance is a new protocol that helps users access crypto structured products for DeFi. It combines options, futures, and fixed income to improve a portfolio's risk-return profile.\n\nTheta Vaults: Theta Vault, which is a yield-focused strategy on ETH and WBTC. The vault earns yield on its deposits by running a weekly automated options selling strategy. The vault reinvests the yield earned back into the strategy, effectively compounding the yields for depositors over time.\n\nThe Theta Vaults run two options strategies to generate yields:\n\nCovered call - Vault writes out of the money covered calls.\n\nPut selling - Vault writes out of the money puts.\n\nRisks: There is inherent smart contract and platform risk involved with managed vaults. Ribbon utilizes Opyn as a settlement layer so there is composability risk with use of multiple protocols. The strategies vary in risk and they also incur the potential risk of loss from being in the money at expiry.\n\nProtocol Analysis: Using a risk analysis framework developed by the DAO, the Policy and Partnerships teams have attempted to score various protocols based on some subjective and non-subjective data. Ribbon scored a 7.2 out of 10 which is medium to high risk. This is due to inherent risks associated with option vaults and inherent protocol risks not only of Ribbon but also where the assets are deployed to.\n\nThe following risk analysis shows the outcome of the Treasury Team's holistic assessment of the proposed platform and intended strategies. Lastly, one final reminder that this score is an average that was derived from an generalized assessment of the platform which includes TVL, audits, protocol age/risk, targeted investment and strategy type.\n\nRibbon Finance\n\nRequest for comment: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1157-request-for-comment-ribbon-finance-whitelist",

      "content": "Summary\n\nSeek authority from the community to conduct a pilot deposit into Tribe Turbo using $1.5M worth of gOHM.\n\nMotivation  \n\nAs Olympus continues strengthening its partnership with Fei Protocol, our DAO has been selected to be part of Tribe Turbo’s first cohort of users. As we aim to provide as much value as possible to all of our close partners, Treasury believes conducting a pilot deposit into Fei Protocol’s new dAPP aligns well with this goal. \n\nSpecifications\n\nTribe Turbo uses a novel architecture on top of a Fuse pool called the “Turbo Pool”. Supported collateral types can borrow (issue) FEI (USD stablecoin) at 0% interest through “Turbo Safes”. The Turbo Safe ensures that the borrowed FEI is subsequently (atomically) deposited into a yield strategy of the user’s choosing. For Olympus, this means we would use gOHM as collateral to borrow FEI and earn a yield on our position by depositing it back in FeiRari Fuse pool.\n\nRisks: \n\nTribe Turbo being a new protocol, depositing funds into it, especially as a first cohort participant, has its fair share of risks. However, considering that Turbo is built on top of Fuse, most of its mechanics have already been battle-tested for a while now. Nevertheless, Treasury recommends starting with a pilot deposit of $1.5M to account for the unknowns.  \n\nProposal\n\nStake $1.5M worth of DAO OHM\n\nDeposit into Tribe Turbo and borrow at a maximum of 20% LTV ($300K FEI) \n\nAny further deposit increase would need to go through another community approval \n\nLinks:\n\nhttps://medium.com/fei-protocol/the-tribe-dao-strongly-believes-that-a-healthy-and-thriving-defi-ecosystem-needs-a-robust-platform-b1faea700dfa\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/olympusdao.eth/proposal/0x00fd601fd700678a9d6b7e484e742ccbbcf2f7f27c6d8f2814e9ba547d0a0f1b\n\nhttps://snapshot.org/#/fei.eth/proposal/0x8fc10a0d66829e7e78b41a72d542adf7720f92b747a083400d77656744169907",

      "title": "OIP - 92 : Whitelist FEI as a treasury Reserve asset",
      "content": "Summary\n\nWhitelist FEI as our next reserve asset to be accumulated through treasury rebalancing or bonds.\n\nBackground\n\nFei protocol launched around the same time as Olympus DAO a little over a year ago. After a rocky start, Fei Protocol made a few key changes to its initial design and has since then found stability. Fei protocol’s Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) currently sits at ~$700M in assets at time of writing - mostly composed of ETH (70%+).\n\nThis PCV can be seen as the backing of FEI stablecoin - as the protocol offers 1:1 redeemability with a 0.5% spread. As of today, User-FEI has a circulating supply of ~300M FEI, is highly liquid and the Fei Protocol has mapped a path to diversification of its PCV - with the goal of being able to better withstand market downturns. For example, Fei V2 uses Balancer V2 pools with algorithmically changed weights depending on FEI’s collateralization ratio to manage risk during volatile market conditions.\n\n\nMotivation\n\nThe Treasury team has been exploring and evaluating multiple options for the next reserve asset and have reached the conclusion that FEI is the best candidate at this time. Specifically, one of the Treasury team objectives is to ensure that OHM’s backing favors decentralized and censorship-resistant assets. Fei protocol’s approach to issuing the FEI stablecoin aligns with our objectives - given it is backed by decentralized assets. As mentioned above, Fei intends to diversify this backing further in order to make it less correlated with the price of ETH.\n\nThe addition of FEI stablecoin to our Treasury would also further align Olympus and Fei protocol - extending opportunities to collaborate.\n\nProposal\n\nThe Treasury team proposes to whitelist FEI stablecoin as an asset for the Olympus treasury. Our exposure would be capped to a maximum of 10% of FEI circulating supply.",

      "content": "### Proposal\n\nEstablish an Olympus Governance Council (OGC), which is primarily responsible for facilitating off-chain processes. Examples of off-chain processes include establishing strategic vision, coordinating working groups to execute on community-approved initiatives, and proposing strategic initiatives to the community via OIP.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that the ultimate authority of the protocol and its functions are Olympus token holders. The OGC will exist in an advisory capacity and will prioritize on-chain governance to further decentralize the Olympus protocol.\n\n#### Structure\n\nThe OGC will initially comprise 7 active members with distinct roles & diverse capabilities reflecting the broad experience and capabilities of OlympusDAO members.\n\nOGC members may resign at any time by posting a notice of resignation that they will retire following the next meeting of the Council.\n\nOGC members may be removed by unanimous Council decision where the member has failed to attend meetings occurring across two consecutive weeks without providing advance notice.\n\nVacancy resulting from removal or resignation of a Council member, shall be filled by decision of OGC pending expiry of the initial members’ term. Notice of a vacancy appointment must be posted to the Olympus governance forum within 1 week of appointment.\n\nAny or all members of OGC may be removed or replaced by OIP.\n\n#### Deliverables\n\nKey deliverables for the OGC include:\n\n* Drive prioritization and alignment across the DAO departments and working groups\n\n* Chart a path to further decentralized DAO governance and operations\n\n* Oversee the broader econOHMy\n\nIn addition, the OGC will be responsible for reviewing community OIPs and delivering a detailed assessment. Once OIPs are passed, OGC will track progress and provide input to working groups responsible for executing community decisions.\n\nEvery 3 months the OGC must prepare a quarterly report detailing the achievements, operations, revenues, and expenditures of the DAO for the previous quarter - along with a detailed description of the strategic direction for the DAO and how the Council plans to achieve that vision.\n\nThe Council must appear before the community to deliver the quarterly report and answer questions concerning its details.\n\nCouncil has the ability to vote on and approve urgent budget items for internal DAO expenses including but not limited to: code audits, tooling costs, and contracted services. Expenses must be detailed in the quarterly OGC report.\n\n### Vote\n**For:** Implement Olympus Governance Council Structure\n\n**Against:** Do not implement OGC",

The OIP stipulated that the grant program be run for a trial period of 3.3 months, at which point the grants team would provide a report updating the community and recommending improvements for the community to consider, discuss, and ultimately vote on.\n\nFull report and temperature check discussion can be found here: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1145-oip-90-olympus-grants-program-further-3-month-approval\n\n## Looking Ahead - Grants v2\n\nEarly feedback on OGP v1 indicates there are the following needs:\n\na) Activate a higher number of smaller grants whilst not swamping existing Committee member process.\n\n_Activate the wider ecosystem to contribute to Olympus by giving clear and transparent avenues to accessing smaller amounts of funding through a nimble and efficient process_\n\n**Proposed solution: Mycelial Method (see below).**\n\nb) Solicit strategic developments to assist in achieving grant and DAO wide OKRs\n\n_Ability to proactively solicit for specific projects through a Request for Proposals process, including the ability to set scope, set up bounties and approach potential teams to help develop_\n\n **Proposed solution: Set up Request for Proposals process and seek authority from the community for grants to set, coordinate, fund and manage projects.**\n\nc) Form Joint Ventures with aligned ecosystems\n\n _Ability to form joint ventures with other grant organisations to co-fund grants which are of benefit to both Olympus and another ecosystem e.g. Olympus and Gnosis putting up 100k USD in match funding for projects of mutual benefit_\n\n **Proposed solution: Seek authority from community to set up and lead Joint Ventures with other grants organisations**\n\n d)  Fund internal projects, not only external\n\n_Ability to fund projects solicited from *within* the DAO, not just external to the DAO._\n\n**Proposed solution: Seek authority from the community to fund projects originating from within the DAO, not just external to DAO.**\n\ne) Clear process for grants larger than 100k USD in scope\n\n_Ability to issue grants larger than 100k USD_\n\n**Proposed solution: Enshrine that grants/projects of larger than 100k USD need to seek authority from the community via OIP in addition to 4/7 committee approval.**\n\nf) Decentralise allocation of grants capital to a wider set of OHMies\n\n_Ability for grants to experiment with opening up decision making to a wider set of OHMies e.g through setting up Shark Tank style curated pitches of pre-vetted grantees to community to fund via Give - with OGP match funding_\n\n*Proposed solution: Seek authority from community to allow OGP Committee to fund experiments in broadening participation in grants capital allocation to community*\n\n### Framework: Mycelial Method\n\nOGP v1 was an adaptation of Uniswap Grants. The Mycelial Method iterates from this starting point and adapts and combines [Lido’s grants program](https://lego.lido.fi/) (which is an adaptation of [Uniswaps process](https://www.unigrants.org/), which itself is an adaptation of [Ethereum Foundation’s process](https://ethereum.org/en/community/grants/)) and the [Web3Foundation’s grant program](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program)\n\n* Sand grains (up to $1000) can be handled by a pair of stewards reporting to two OGP committee members out of their individual committee member budgets (50:50).\n* Pebbles (up to $10,000) require a third OGP committee member to agree to the grant approval and participate in the evaluation of the results.\n* Boulders (up to $100,000) require majority approval of the OGP committee.\n* Mountains (more than $100k) additionally require a regular OIP governance process.\n\n### Quarterly budget:\n\nThe OGP Individual Committee Members will have a max quarterly aggregate budget of up to $105,000 USD, divided into individual budgets of $15,000 USD for each OGP committee member, from the total budget of the wider OGP budget of $1mm per 3 months. Budget and caps to be reassessed after the end of a quarter.\n\nIf an OGP committee member exhausts their quarterly individual committee member budget, they can still propose to the full committee that sand grains and pebbles receive grants out of the general portion of the budget, but will need to obtain approval of a majority of the OGP committee members. Committee members may delegate their share of budget to be administered by an alternate committee member.\n\nWhile the goals and priorities of the grant program will be thoroughly discussed and reviewed by the community through public discourse, the decision to start the OGP by operating as a small committee is to ensure that the application and decision process will be efficient and predictable, so applicants have clear objectives and timely decisions. All OGP committee members are equal in power but have different specialties.\n\nAt the end of three months the committee makes a report on the grants program and a retrospective on how to improve it.\n\n### Accountability and Auditing:\n\nAll successful Sand-grains and Pebbles will be listed publicly in real time upon acceptance,  including which committee member/s approved the grant. Payments will not be released to the grantee until the deliverable has been completed and checked. Deliverables will also be made public in real time. This information will be communicated on the [Grants notion section](https://www.notion.so/olympusdao/Grants-ffdcf5eab226410cbfac6350639c2436).\n\nAll Boulders and Mountains are listed upon committee approval and negotiation of agreements.\n\n## Committee\n\nNominated to the committee were Catwalk, Solarpunk and Kleb. Here is a little about them:\n\n* Catwalk - Background in grants, tech, data science, start-ups, writing, and organizing in decentralized environments. Currently wearing many hats in Grants: monitoring and evaluation, strategy, operations, marketing, etc. Exceptionally interested in the hard problems of scaling coordination problems. they/them\n* Solarpunk - Background in tech, platform cooperatives. Built and sold tech companies, VC experience, been through YC. Also wearing many hats in Grants, but will be focused on DD, content marketing and strategy, and impact evaluation. he/him\n* Kleb - Analyst, project manager and serial startup-er. Also one of the core members of Incubator.\n\nChurch, Dropkick Darren and Brian all had to step down from the committee. We thank them for their efforts during the time of their tenure. To recap, our committee of 7 is composed of Apollo, Appleseed, Catwalk, Json, Kleb, Solarpunk and WollemiPine.\n\n## Summary\n\nGrants rules and we want to keep growing the econOHMy GDP, activating our ecosystem and expanding OlympusDAO beyond web3. It’s also integral that the Grants team be empowered to be effective in the most cost efficient and impactful ways given current market conditions. We will shortly put forward an OIP requesting\n\n* Implement the Mycelial Method to enable nimble funding of smaller grants to activate a wider number of contributors from the ecosystem to contribute to OlympusDAO\n* Set up a Request for Proposals process and seek authority from the community for grants to set, initiate, coordinate, fund and manage projects.\n* Lead Joint Ventures with other grants organisations up to a max of $100k per venture.\n* Fund internally originated projects as well as externally.\n* Ratify that projects seeking > $100k in funding require OIP in addition to majority committee vote.\n* Run the program on a rolling basis with a review, report to community and OIP every 3 months.\n* $1,335,916.52 from OGP v1 was not spent and remains in the DAO multisig.\n* Fund Grants multisig with $180k of OHM over 3 installments of 60k USD worth of OHM over 3 months to cover administration of the program with contributors compensated commensurate with the rates approved within the DAO.\n* Fund Grants multisig with $1mm in DAO owned OHM from DAO multisig (OHM rate set at time of OIP-90 snapshot passing ([Time Weighted Average Price](https://dune.xyz/queries/395676) or similar)) within 7 days of OIP-90 Snapshot passing.\n* Unused funds contribute towards the next OGP OIP budget or returned to DAO multisig if OGP is not renewed.\n\nHaving a community approved budget means that there will be transparency and accountability for the program - if we aren’t performing we will have to turn up here next quarter and tell you why and provide you the opportunity to cut our funding.\n\n## Vote\n\n**For**: Approve the program as specified\n\n**Against**: Do not approve the program as specified\n",

This campaign publicizes the launch of the Klima retirement aggregator which allows individuals and organizations to offset their carbon footprint on the Polygon network.\n\n**Proposal:** OlympusDAO to become an official partner of Klima Infinity and to offset 33,333.33 or 3,333.33 tonnes of carbon via the KlimaDAO retirement aggregator. Depending on the carbon asset (BCT vs MCO2) Olympus would need to retire 5186 or 509 respectively of KLIMA to offset based on BCT retirement. This would be 3.5% or 0.34% of the current staked amount in Olympus’ treasury which is approximately 147k KLIMA.\n\nMore context in the forum post.",

      "title": "TAP-9 Rocket Pool Whitelist",
      "content": "Summary: Seek authority from the community to whitelist Rocket Pool for staking of idle ETH reserve.\n\nBackground: Recently the DAO has been accumulating additional ETH reserves assets such via OIP-15: Add ETH to the Treasury. The DAO is now seeking the ability to stake idle reserve ETH in Rocket Pool to further increase the backing of OHM and to support the overall Ethereum Network.\n\nMotivation: Whitelisting Rocket Pool will allow Olympus to earn yield on idle ETH reserve and to help support the Ethereum network and grow the treasury. The DAO will adhere to the treasury framework of no more than 25% of excess reserve assets to a protocol. However, this is just a limit and the DAO will assess the optimal distribution on a per asset basis.\n\nDescription from https://rocketpool.net/: Rocket Pool is a first of its kind ETH2 Proof of Stake Protocol, designed to be community owned, decentralized, trustless and compatible with staking in Ethereum 2.0. It was first conceived in late 2016 and has since had over 5 successful public betas over the life span of ETH2 development. Rocket Pool strives to embody the core ethos of Ethereum and DeFi, specifically the non-custodial, trustless nature that allows self-sovereignty to truly thrive. The core premise behind a protocol is to ensure the network is not beholden to any one party. This is a principle directly linked to Ethereum and ETH2 itself, and a mindset used at every stage of the process as Rocket Pool has evolved.\n\nRisks: The protocol allocates the ETH to a decentralized node network for it to be staked. These nodes are operated in a trustless manner and the trust lies within the node operator to maintain adequate up-time. In the event of funds slashed due to inadequate presence for network validation, the node operator will forfeit RPL. Once funds are staked there is a finite number of ways to exit the staked position, Olympus can swap out of this particular position via DEXs but it can lead to potential slippage. The protocol operates in a trust minimized system that is controlled via smart contracts where there are assumption made on the behavior of node operators. A potential exploitation was brought to the team from a competitor but promptly acknowledged and fixed.\n\nProtocol Analysis: Using a risk analysis framework developed by the DAO, the Policy and Partnerships teams have attempted to score various protocols based on some subjective and non-subjective data. Rocket Pool scored a 5.2 out of 10. This is due to inherent risks associated with Ether staking for the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade.\n\nThe following risk analysis shows the outcome of the Treasury Team's holistic assessment of the proposed platform and intended strategies. Lastly, one final reminder that this score is an average that was derived from an generalized assessment of the platform which includes TVL, audits, protocol age/risk, targeted investment and strategy type.\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p-FWa18Q-PD5V5WWadzSZcTMZSUM4QZBzMnmPloMFmk/edit?usp=sharing\n\nRequest for comment: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1128-request-for-comment-rocket-pool-whitelist/8\n\nTAP-9 Forum post: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1132-tap-9-rocket-pool-whitelist",

      "title": "OIP-87: BeraChain Investment + Strategic Partnership",
      "content": "Discussion: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1127-oip-87-berachain-investment-strategic-partnership\n\nThe purpose of OIP-87 is to formalize Olympus participating in the seed round of BeraChain, as well as align as strategic partners with the BeraChain Foundation. The BeraChain team is raising $10m USD at a $50m fully diluted valuation. We propose that Olympus deploys $500k of treasury assets to invest in BeraChain. This allocation  would be 1% of the genesis token supply. Another 1% will be given to Olympus from the BeraChain strategic partnerships fund to bring Olympus' total ownership to 2% of the network.\n\nThis would be Olympus' largest early-stage allocation to a seed venture to date.\nBackground\nWhat is BeraChain?\n\nBeraChain is a fully EVM equivalent & IBC connected layer one blockchain that implements a novel \"Proof of Liquidity\" Consensus mechanism. PoLC aims to combat the shortcomings of traditional Proof of Stake validated blockchains by systemically ensuring the creation of liquidity as a core primitive required for block production.\n\nKey Features of BeraChain:\n\n    Tri-Token Model: BeraChain follows a Tri-Token model consisting of fee token, governance token, and native fractional algorithmic stablecoin\n\n    Proof of Liquidity Consensus: Validator consensus power is calculated via the depth of liquidity pools within the native decentralized exchange. We have partnered with CrocSwap to assist in the development. The DEX is tied into the consensus mechanism, allowing liquidity \"stakers\" to earn block rewards. The consensus engine is based on a heavily modified version of Tendermint and utilizes the Cosmos SDK as the application layer\n\n    Full EVM Compatibility: Existing Ethereum smart contracts can be deployed without modification\n\n    Full IBC Enablement: Protocols can enable IBC transfers for their ERC20 tokens, allowing permissionless ERC20 bridging to over 30 chains, such as the Cosmos Hub and Terra\n\n    Built-in Synapse Integration: Protocols can bridge their tokens to 10+ EVM blockchains with minimal engineering effort; BeraChain handles everything\n\n    Interblock Computation: Protocols can execute autonomous tasks (keeper transactions) without external invocation. Reduces physical hardware requirements for DAOs and facilitates centralization aspects of running periodic tasks\n\n    Liquidity Provisioning: Governance token voting power can be used to direct systemically created liquidity as part of the block rewards and token bonding process. Protocols can utilize this feature to secure permanent, locked liquidity for their protocol without dilution due to bonding\n\nMotivation\n\nTo provide an opportunity for Olympus to participate in BeraChain seed round and form a strategic partnership.\nProposal\n\nProposed Terms Seed Round Participation Olympus is to  deploy $500k in OHM distributed to the BeraChain Foundation in 5 installments, paid out at the first of each month beginning April 1st, 2022, and concluding on August 1st, 2022. In exchange, Olympus will receive the market equivalent of $500k (1% of the initial token supply) in the native fee token during the Token Generation Event (TGE). These tokens are subject to a three-year vesting period, with an unlock cliff at six months. Vesting of tokens begins at the signing of the genesis block.\nStrategic Partnerships\n\nThe BeraChain Foundation will distribute additional fee tokens to the market equivalent value of $500k (1%) to Olympus to participate in the network as a strategic partner. These tokens are subject to the same vesting schedule listed above. In exchange for this allotment, our team and Olympus have agreed to commitments including but not limited to:\nFrom Olympus DAO:\n\n    Creation of an Olympus Treasury on BeraChain for storing \"Cosmos\" native assets, with the initial focus on Berachain native fee token, Berachain stablecoin, and UST - subject to required Olympus Treasury team risk assessment, recommendation of asset allocations and treasury allocation proposal (TAP). In the longer term, consideration of expansion other Cosmos assets such as ATOM or LUNA\n\n    A deployment of Olympus Pro on BeraChain, with native Berachain protocols to act as launch partners\n\n    Marketing and promotion assistance\n\n    Continue to collaborate and explore further opportunities to integrate and work together\n\nFrom BeraChain:\n\n    Deployment of the aforementioned Olympus Treasury at the following vanity address:\n\n    0x3300000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\n    Both the investment and strategic partnership tokens can be allocated directly to this address\n\n    Bridging support via the Synapse Protocol and IBC for gOHM + other cross-chain support as needed for Olympus v3\n\nBeraChain x Olympus Odyssey\n\n    BeraChain will continue efforts in helping Olympus Odyssey cross-chain engineering efforts, including but not limited to smart contract + cross-chain relayer architecture/design\n\n    Odyssey will utilize BeraChain as the \"main hub\" for storage, ERC721, ERC1155, and rewards routing\n\nPolling Period\n\nThe temperature check process begins now and will run for at least 72 hours. A Snapshot vote will subsequently be initiated and open for at least 72 hours.",

The migration deploys liquidity for both these OHM pairs across the full price range, and adjusts the liquidity depth in the same process. Additionally, the proposal outlines the implementation of a novel policy lever — concentrated liquidity bonds.\n\nIn symbiosis with the Inverse Bond Policy Lever, concentrated liquidity positions are a mechanism for Olympus to:\n\nIncrease liquidity per OHM in circulation\n\nReinforce the backing of OHM\n\nDampen volatility in specific price ranges\n\nMeet the demand for additional liquidity on the downside, and upside alike.\n\nIn practical terms, this policy lever e.g. allows Olympus to set desired price impacts on trades in either direction, achieving a more efficient use of liquidity. With more detailed control of  the liquidity profile, Olympus can also manage risk scenarios such as liquidation cascades triggered by third party lending markets.\n\nMore context: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1122-oip-86-uniswap-v3-migration-proposal/8",

      "title": "TAP 7 - Anchor Protocol Whitelist",
      "content": "**Summary:**\nSeek authority from the community to whitelist Anchor Protocol for depositing of UST.\n\n**Background:**\nRecently the DAO has been accumulating UST through bonds. The framework and guidance for treasury exposure to UST was outlined in OIP-52 - Add UST to the Treasury. The DAO is now seeking the ability to deposit idle UST in Anchor to further increase the backing of OHM and to support the Terra ecosystem.\n\nOlympus will receive newly minted Anchor Terra (aTerra) in exchange for their deposit. aTerra tokens represent Olympus’ share in the stablecoin pool and can later be redeemed to claim the initial stablecoin deposit, along with accrued interest and subsidies, see: https://app.anchorprotocol.com.\n\n**Motivation:**\nWhitelisting Anchor Protocol will allow Olympus to earn a fixed rate return on providing collateral to the UST Stablecoin Market.\n\nDescription from docs.anchorprotocol.com: Anchor is a decentralized savings protocol offering low-volatile yields on Terra stablecoin deposits. The Anchor rate is powered by a diversified stream of staking rewards from major proof-of-stake blockchains, and therefore can be expected to be much more stable than money market interest rates.  The Anchor community believes that a stable, reliable source of yield in Anchor has the opportunity to become the reference interest rate in crypto.\n\n**Risks:**\nUST is a non-native asset to ETH L1, the DAO will be providing collateral to a stablecoin market and Anchor holds the majority of UST supply however Olympus will only provide a small percentage in comparison to total excess reserves which coincides with low risk per the DAO risk analysis.\n\n**Protocol Analysis:**\nUsing a risk analysis framework developed by the DAO, the Policy and Partnerships teams have attempted to score various protocols based on some subjective and non-subjective data. Anchor scored a 3. This is due to inherent risks associated with the asset itself, UST, allocation of excess reserves and the functionality of the protocol. The subjective value was derived from a combination of quantitative and qualitative.\n\nThe following risk analysis shows the outcome of the Treasury Team's holistic assessment of the proposed platform and intended strategies. Lastly, one final reminder that this score is an average that was derived from an generalized assessment of the platform which includes TVL, audits, protocol age/risk, targeted investment and strategy type.\n\n**Risk analysis:**\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wD8_5HwPhL0PYii2wMwOy_rQBZ_SlI5MQUzZIlhMnFw/edit#gid=0\n\n**Discussion and more context:**\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1105-tap-7-anchor-protocol-whitelist",

      "content": "Summary\n\nExecute a DAO swap with Fei Protocol for $2m TRIBE at a 30-day time-weighted average price.\n\nMotivation\n\nRari was one of the first protocols to partner with Olympus a few months ago, through the integration of sOHM/gOHM on Fuse. Rari recently merged with Fei protocol and now forms one of the biggest protocols in the ecosystem. We want to further align our two communities as we believe there are many positive sum outcomes to be had from formalizing a partnership.\n\nProposal\n\nExecute a $2M TRIBE-OHM DAO swap at a 30-day-time-weighted average price.\n\nOlympus to put up a proposal to take in FEI as a Treasury reserve asset, capped at a maximum of 10% of FEI circulating supply. As always, these bonds would be managed independently by Policy.\n\nFei protocol to buy FEI bonds up to the point where OHM represents 1% of the Protocol-Controlled Value. Today, this would amount to $6.6M worth of OHM held by Fei protocol. Note that the 1% cap could be further increased in the future through a governance vote from Tribe holders.\n\nBoth the Olympus exposure to FEI and the Fei exposure to OHM are represented as maximums. The expectation could be around proportionality up to the max i.e. 0.5% OHM in Fei PCV ~= 5% FEI in Olympus Treasury\n\nOlympus Treasury to allocate funds in Fuse while fully respecting Treasury allocation guidelines approved by the community (OIP-73).\n\nOlympus to explore new use cases & yield opportunities enabled by Turbo\n\nOhmies would, for example, have access to lower risk opportunities of generating passive yields on their holdings compared to what is currently available on the market.\n\nPolling Period\n\nThe temperature check process begins now and will run for at least 5 days. After this, a Snapshot vote will be initiated and open for at least 48 hours.\n\nLinks:\n\nProposal on Fei's forum: https://tribe.fei.money/t/fip-79-olympus-dao-fei-partnership/3939\n\nFei PCV: https://app.fei.money/analytics\n\nTurbo:https://medium.com/fei-protocol/the-tribe-dao-strongly-believes-that-a-healthy-and-thriving-defi-ecosystem-needs-a-robust-platform-b1faea700dfa",

Growing Olympus’ network effects by pushing the adoption of $OHM as a base pair remains a key objective for the DAO. One way of achieving this is by supporting external OHM denominated liquidity pairs and helping ensure these remain/become partners’ dominant LPs.\n\nBenefits:\n\nStrategically, it signals to the market  that Olympus is willing to step in and support strong partners when needed, while economically, it helps establish OHM denominated pools as the dominant trading venues, which will also drive volume to Olympus’ POL.\n\nProgram Details\n\nPolicy proposes an upper limit on Olympus’ ownership of partners’ OHM denominated pools. The maximum amount that can be bonded will be the lowest of:\n\n10% of the external LP value\n1% of Olympus’ market cap\nOnly whitelisted strategic assets will be considered for new liquidity pairs (see OIP-51a for list of eligible strategic assets)\n\nPolicy to determine on which AMM liquidity will be added",

A solution is to buy other cryptos with current reserves and reduce exposure to USD stablecoins. Open other Proposal with trade strategy proposals.\n2)  It is a risk. A solution is to accept more type of bonds. Open other Proposal to define the strategy.\n3) It is a risk. Both of the above are viable solutions.\n4) It is a risk. None of the above options are viable solutions. Follow up with other proposals to find a solution.\n5 It is not a risk, because DAI and other algorithmic stablecoin reserves consist of cryptos and somehow that preserve the value of the currency even if it decreases for USD.\n6) It is not a risk, because of how OlympusDAO currently operates, some part of it's protocol I missed removes the mentioned risk.\n7) It is not a risk, because of another reason.\n\nIf you think this proposal is good, feel free to tip my address with ETH, BNB, AVAX or FTM.

      "title": "OIP-79: Approve FIAT DAO as an OHMDEBTOR",
      "content": "Forum Post: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1055-oip-79-approve-fiat-dao-as-an-ohmdebtor\nSummary\n\nFIAT DAO is transitioning away from gOHM-denominated liquidity on mainnet Sushiswap to OHM-denominated liquidity on mainnet Uniswap v3. In consultation with the Treasury and Partnerships teams of the Olympus DAO, we are proposing that we be approved as an OHMDEBTOR at a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 75% so as to maximize the capital efficiency of our current OHM holdings.\nMotivation\n\nFIAT DAO launched liquidity mining rewards for its governance token, FDT, on November 15th with an emphasis on a gOHM pairing. Later, on December 15th, FIAT DAO initiated an Olympus Pro program to accumulate FDT-gOHM liquidity; this program has attracted nearly half a million worth of LP tokens to date. Lastly, FIAT DAO just cemented a formal partnership with OlympusDAO via OIP-73 which included a token swap for 1% of FDT supply at a 50% discount. It is now our intent to migrate liquidity away from Sushiswap gOHM to Uniswap v3 OHM, as gOHM liquidity routing on Sushiswap is not currently available.\n\nOne way of doing this would be to simply a) pair discretionary budget FDT against the partnership OHM, and b) unwrap and migrate the Sushiswap liquidity owned by the DAO to Uniswap v3. This, however, would result in the DAO’s relative stake in the OlympusDAO to be eroded over time, as well as preclude it from participating in community governance. While optimal for FDT’s market participants, it ultimately undermines the very reason we were intent on aligning ourselves with the ecosystem in the first place.\n\nAs such, we are keen on finding a solution that preserves the DAO’s OHM purchasing power, retains its voting privileges, and unlocks liquidity for users holding FDT.\nProposal\n\nIn line with Redacted Cartel’s OIP-69, and in consultation with the Olympus Treasury and Partnerships teams, we propose to be approved as an OHMDEBTOR (the incurDebt() function) - which would allow for FIAT DAO to collateralize its  treasury sOHM while still provisioning naked OHM liquidity against FDT.\n\nWe propose the following borrowing parameters:\n\n    An absolute borrowing limit of 80,000 OHM\n\n    A 75% LTV limit\n\nThis line of credit would essentially be utilized intermittently. Once, to instantiate OHM for Uni v3 liquidity against all of FIAT DAO’s sOHM holdings, and then again only as existing debt gets paid down.\n\nIn conjunction with this program, FIAT DAO would transition its Olympus Pro program away from LP tokens, instead seeking to accumulate OHM outright to pay down the debt. We view this as being more productive than acquiring FDT/OHM tokens as one OHM worth of debt paid off effectively unlocks 1XX% OHM-worth of liquidity.\n\nWe are working with the Olympus DAO contributors to deploy the incurred debtOHM to a smart contract that would ensure no borrowed OHM would ever be able to be sold or staked.\nPolling Period\n\nThe temperature check polling process begins now and will be live for at least 72 hours - this will then be sent to a Snapshot vote which will be live for at least 72 hours.\nPoll\n\nFor: FIAT DAO to receive approval for the incurDebt() function.\nAgainst: FIAT DAO not eligible for incurDebt() functionality.",

      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal is designed to add a third tier of bugs to the Bug Bounty program outlined in OIP-17, OIP-34, and OIP-38. This new tier will cover “bugs/exploits which could lead to an incorrect rebase amount” and will provide a flat fee reward of $33,333 per vulnerability/exploit. This OIP also will retroactively award 1 bug bounty of this size to a submission previously received through ImmuneFi which would have qualified under this tier, should it pass review by engineering.\n\nMotivation\n\nAfter we launched the bug bounty with ImmuneFi we have received a a bug which, in extreme cases, could lead to incorrect rebase amounts. This bug does not qualify under Tiers 1 or 2 of the Bug Bounty as currently specified. However, Bug Bounty Management unanimously agrees the efforts of the whitehats who brought this to our attention should be rewarded, and we should encourage people to bring forward more bugs of this nature.\n\nAccordingly, I believe it is in Olympus’ best interest to add the additional “bug type” to the Bug Bounty program created through OIP-17, and to provide a bounty of $33,333 and a Proof of Whitehat NFT to the aforementioned whitehats should their bug submission pass review with engineering.\n\nProposal\n\nChange the text of the Olympus Bug Bounty from:\n\nCritical vulnerabilities are further subcategorized into two tiers:\n\nTier 1: For bugs/exploits which would lead to a loss of bond funds or a loss of user funds, a flat reward of USD 333 333 is provided.\n\nTier 2: For bugs/exploits which would lead to a loss of treasury funds, a flat reward of USD 3 333 333 is provided.\n\nTo\n\nCritical vulnerabilities are further subcategorized into three tiers:\n\nTier 1: For bugs/exploits which would lead to a loss of bond funds or a loss of user funds, a flat reward of USD 333 333 is provided.\n\nTier 2: For bugs/exploits which would lead to a loss of treasury funds, a flat reward of USD 3 333 333 is provided.\n\nTier 3: For bugs/exploits which would lead to an incorrect rebase amount, a flat reward of USD 33 333 is provided.\n\nAdditionally this OIP authorizes the retroactive awarding of one Tier 3 Bounty and one Proof of Whitehat NFT to one whitehat team which had previously submitted a bounty which would have qualified under Tier 3 (the details of which will be disclosed once a fix is implemented), if said bug passes review with engineering which it is currently undergoing.\n\nPolling Period\n\nThe polling process begins now and will end at 10:00 UTC on February 3rd 2022. After this, a Scattershot vote will be put up at 10:00 UTC on February 4th 2022.\n\nPoll\n\nFor: The text of the Bug Bounty program, on the ImmuneFi website, will be changed as previously specified and one Tier 3 bounty and proof of whitehat nft will be awarded retroactively.\n\nAgainst: The text of the Bug Bounty program will not be changed.",

      "title": "OIP-71 Goddess DAO Launch Liquidity Assistance Proposal",
      "content": "Summary\n\nAssist Goddess DAO with gOHM launch liquidity by providing $1.5mm gOHM liquidity with its GNT token - which will then be bonded back to Olympus as gOHM bonds through Olympus Pro. Provide Olympus 1.5% of Goddess DAO governance token for its assistance on the condition it is retained in the Olympus treasury.\n\nBackground\n\nFlow Carbon/Goddess DAO aims to accelerate market adoption of tokenized carbon offsets, creating a liquid and transparent market. This market gives project proponents who create offsets access to instant liquidity, from the same pool that corporates can buy from at scale.\n\nWhat is GNT?\n\nGNT is a bundle token composed of individual ERC-20 tokens called GCO2. Each GCO2 is backed 1:1 with one metric ton of un-retired carbon credits. Different GCO2 tokens are specifically linked to a specific batch of credits issued for a specific project. Each individual GNT token represents one metric tonne of carbon certified as an offset, and meets the following criteria, which directly track what corporate buyers are seeking in the market:\nCertified by one of the market-recognized certification bodies, which currently are: Verra, American Carbon Registry, Climate Action Reserve, or Gold Standard\nCertified pursuant to a nature-based methodology from the above registries (i.e. REDD/REDD+, ARR, IFM)\nVintage (issuance) year not more than five years old\n\nFor further background on GNT, Goddess DAO and Flow Carbon please see the forum discussion here https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/994-oip-71-goddess-dao-launch-liquidity-assistance-proposal \n\nMotivation\n\nGoddess DAO aims to be a long-term values-aligned protocol with Olympus and see the value of and potential of OHM to achieve its vision. Flow Carbon previously conducted an otc swap of carbon credits (to create BCT) for OHM to Olympus, for the purpose of vesting its pKLIMA tokens. See: <https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/187-oip-36-purchase-bct-in-the-otc-market-before-klima-launch ](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/187-oip-36-purchase-bct-in-the-otc-market-before-klima-launch)\nThe Flow team immediately staked the OHM from this sale and still holds it today. <https://etherscan.io/token/0x04f2694c8fcee23e8fd0dfea1d4f5bb8c352111f?a=0xab9952041329fda60288d17116b8cb959c920713 ](https://etherscan.io/token/0x04f2694c8fcee23e8fd0dfea1d4f5bb8c352111f?a=0xab9952041329fda60288d17116b8cb959c920713)\nHaving deep liquidity for the GNT token is essential for the launch - and Goddess DAO believes it would strengthen the launch for it to be paired with gOHM. Olympus is best placed to assist in this endeavor, and to show gratitude to the Ohmies, Flow is providing some of Goddess DAO’s governance token supply to the Olympus treasury. Flow hopes for this to be the first step in a long relationship with Olympus that will be mutually beneficial.\n\nProposal\n\nOlympus to swap 80% of the BCT in its treasury for GNT to be held in the Olympus treasury and used to interact with Klima for the purpose of bonding or redeeming for KLIMA tokens\nOlympus provides $1.5mm in gOHM for initial liquidity of GNT as GNT-gOHM on Polygon - Goddess DAO will bond $1.5mm of gOHM (as an equal number of gOHM paired with the GNT) through Olympus Pro (OP) to Olympus and then Olympus will release the liquidity to Goddess DAO (Goddess DAO will not reduce or dispose of the gOHM within 24 months of launch without the consent of Olympus)\nGoddess DAO will provide $50K GDSS to Olympus to seed a liquidity pool of gOHM-GDSS and bond a further $50K in gOHM to Olympus through OP\nGoddess DAO will provide Olympus 1.5% of GDSS supply on the condition that it can’t be disposed of without the consent of Goddess DAO\n\nPolling Period\n\nThis vote will be live for at least 72 hours.\n\nPoll question\n\nFor: Approve the launch liquidity assistance proposal\nAgainst: Do nothing\n",

JonesDAO will provide Olympus with 3.3% of its governance token at launch, which Olympus can use to stake, govern, and earn a share of protocol fees within JonesDAO. Olympus commits that it will not reduce its exposure to JonesDAO's governance token, and will provide advice and assistance to JonesDAO. JonesDAO will become an official treasury partner of Olympus, generating yield via safe, actively managed and sufficiently hedged options strategies deployed on a portion of treasury assets - subject to an appropriate risk managed pilot under a separate OIP.\n\nBackground\n\nFor further background please see the OIP-74 forum proposal https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1009-oip-74-partnership-with-jonesdao \n\nMax supply: 10,000,000\nSupply at launch: 2,440,000\nDigits: 18\nOperational Allocation: 15%\n\nThis allocation is used to handle governance, incentivize community contributions and strategists, help grow the platform and recruit talent, and account for operating and growth costs.\n\nPlatform Rewards: 42%\nThese rewards will incentivize the use and upkeep of the Jones DAO protocol.\nTeam Allocation: 12%\nVested for 18 months distributed using a drip system via a smart contract.\nPublic Sale: 17%\nPrivate Sale: 9.67%\n3 month cliff, and then vested over 6 months.\nAirdrop: 1%\nSplit between guarded launch members and Dopex SSOV users.\nOlympus: 3.3%\nProposed allocation for OlympusDAO to be held in perpetuity.\n\nTeam\n\nCore Members:\n@FroyoFren\n@xenes1s\n@0x_ultra\nAdvisors:\n@Halko500k\n@witherblock\n\nMotivation\n\nWe are Olympus giga bulls.

      "content": "Please see the forum for full details and discussion:\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1016-oip-75-olympus-compensation-process\n\nSummary\n\nThis proposal aims to create a permanent approach to compensating dedicated contributors that is transparent, fair, and rewards long term engagement. This proposal builds on OIP-47 -  Olympus Stopgap Budget Proposal - which specified the maximum monthly allocation by role but did not define the process for determining allocations or frequency of payments.\n\nThis proposal is the result of over two months of community discussions, including a DAO-wide sync on December 6, 2021. It incorporates over 200 comments and suggestions from community members.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe current compensation system is not scalable as we grow, and we have reached the limit of its capabilities. Lack of standardization around compensation per contribution effort creates unnecessary stress for contributors, strategos, and the community alike.\n\nThere needs to be transparency around the roles available and the compensation associated with those roles. OlympusDAO risks losing (and will have difficulty attracting) top contributors, unless changes are made.\n\nOlympus has an opportunity to lead by showing that DAOs can be attractive career choices and by building a framework that makes OlympusDAO the top choice for DAO contributors.\n\nProposal\n\nOlympus will set compensation for contributors based on two factors:\n\nRole: defines the skills required to contribute (e.g. engineering, marketing, operations).\nLevel: contribution for a particular pay period (e.g., story points, OKRs, deliverables).\nThe quadratic compensation model recognizes and rewards the asymmetrical value provided by top contributors while also providing a way for new contributors to onboard and be recognized.\n\n\nVOTE:\n\nFor: adopt a standard approach to compensating contributors across the DAO.\n\nAgainst: continue having inconsistent compensation models across each Stratego and group.",

      "title": "OIP-76: Create Inverse Bond Policy Lever",
      "content": "View discussion on this OIP on the forum post:\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1020-oip-76-create-inverse-bond-policy-lever\n\nIntroduction\n\nOhmies know that OHM is backed by the assets in Olympus treasury, and that the treasury backing of each OHM has increased considerably since launch. OHM trades at a premium to its backing because the market understands that the treasury, revenue, liquidity, products, services and ecosystem integrations will continue to grow.\n\nIt’s important to signal that backing per OHM will continue to increase, regardless of market trends.\n\nTo ensure backing is always able to increase, the DAO Policy team proposes to add inverse bonds to the treasury toolbox. Inverse bonds are exactly what they sound like: bonds, but inversed. The inverse bonds will be initialized if OHM trades below backing, defined as the market value of our treasury assets (not including the OHM side of LP), divided by the circulating supply of OHM. When initialized, users can send OHM to the treasury in exchange for an asset held by the treasury. Similar to how bonds work today, the discount for these bonds will change over time and the market decides acceptable discounts. Also like normal bonds, inverse bonds themselves don't impact market prices.\n\nIt bears specifically mentioning that this is not a static, \"direct redeem\" mechanism. Inverse bonds will remove sell pressure from the market, but in a way that will at the same time increase the backing per OHM. Inverse bonds increase the backing per OHM by reducing the amount of OHM in circulation, while paying out less than each OHM’s backing.\n\nMotivation\n\nThe Olympus smart contracts guarantee that 1 OHM is always backed by at least 1 USD in stablecoins. On top of that, Olympus pioneered protocol owned liquidity, where Olympus owns over 99% of all the OHM liquidity. This means that there will always be deep market liquidity for OHM.\n\nCurrently, the standard bonding process only increases backing per OHM when the treasury can sell bonds above backing price.\n\nInverse bonds add another mechanism that in certain market conditions will allow OHM holders to sell their OHM at a premium, without affecting the market price and while simultaneously increasing backing per OHM.\n\nBy introducing inverse bonds, Olympus is also able to maintain the bonding process throughout all market conditions.\n\nIllustrative Example:\n\nOHM price is at $100, Backing is at $120. You see that the inverse bond price has ticked up to a 5% premium. That means you will be able to sell your OHM at $105 to the treasury, instead of $100 to the market. The inverse bond price would not be able to exceed $120, because at that point it's a net drain on the treasury.\n\n\nProposal\n\nAuthorize the policy team to:\n- Create inverse bonds as a market lever\n- Launch inverse bonds if OHM begins to trade below its backing. Note that it is not a tool to peg OHM to that value. The lever brings OHM out of circulation and burns it, which increases the backing per OHM on every inverse bond executed.",

      "title": "OIP-72: FIAT DAO x Olympus Partnership",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThe initial core contributors to FIAT DAO are seeking the formalization of a DAO-to-DAO partnership with Olympus through a treasury token swap, as well as commitment to prioritized co-development. We are building a protocol for leveraging fixed income assets, like OlympusDAO v2 bonds, and are excited by the design space possible with OHM’s “exorbitant privilege” as a reserve-backed asset.\n\nYou can learn more about us through our Linktree and our recently published whitepaper.\n\nBackground\n\nSee the proposal section for more background information https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1001-oip-72-fiat-dao-x-olympus-partnership \n\nMotivation\n\nSee the proposal section for more motivation information https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1001-oip-72-fiat-dao-x-olympus-partnership \n\nRationale\n\nUnder these terms, FIAT DAO will be providing 1% of $FDT supply to Olympus DAO at a 50% discount to prevailing market prices. OlympusDAO would be entrusted with half this amount liquid from the commencement. The vesting schedule on the other half would be faster than that of seed contributors (two years) as well as that of initial core contributors (three years). FIAT DAO is further committed to providing development resources for two key integrations which are expanded upon in the “Development Commitments” section.\nFIAT DAO will look to accumulate $gOHM in order to have a material say in OlympusDAO governance. FIAT-OHM bonds are our ultimate priority in the future for this partnership. \nProviding liquidity for $gOHM will also be considered a viable treasury strategy for the DAO.\nAdditional context around this offer should also be considered. To date, FIAT DAO has allocated 0.5% of its token supply to the OlympusDAO community via the Jubilee event that took place throughout November. Moreover, another 1.1% of token supply is being distributed via liquidity mining rewards to providers pairing FDT against wsOHM and gOHM on Sushiswap - not to mention the further 0.5% of supply set aside for Olympus Pro. OlympusDAO will have thus received, either directly or to its community, 3.1% of FDT supply under the terms of this proposal.\n\nProspective Partner Integrations\n\nFIAT DAO sees three primary integrations to be built with \nOlympusDAO:\nShort-Term: “OHMptions”\nMedium-Term: Olympus Treasury Bonds\nLong-Term: FIAT-OHM Bonds\nSee the proposal section for more information on the proposed intergrations https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1001-oip-72-fiat-dao-x-olympus-partnership \n\nProposal\n\nApprove the implementation and prioritization of minimal viable product for Ohmptions as described above and the exploration of the other areas of collaboration subject to further governance votes as required.\nApprove Treasury swap of OHM for 1% of $FDT supply at a 50% discount, with 0.5% of the FDT vested immediately to Olympus and 0.5% FDT to be vested to Olympus over 12 months.\nOlympus will provide 0.5% FDT supply worth of OHM vested immediately to Fiat DAO.\nBoth Olympus and Fiat DAO commit to retain the swapped tokens.\nA 7 day historical TWAP from the date of announcement of this proposal will be used for conducting the swap should this proposal be approved by community governance.\nPolling Period\nThe temperature check process begins now and will run for at least 24 hours. After this, a Snapshot vote will be initiated and open for at least 48 hours.\nConduct a treasury swap and partner with FIAT DAO?\n\nFor: Approve the implementation and swap.\nAgainst: Do nothing\n",

      "title": "OIP-73: Treasury Framework",
      "content": "Summary:\n\nAdopt a framework distinguishing (1) key treasury decisions and guidelines that require a community vote from (2) operational levers that the treasury team uses to implement community decisions, in which case the treasury team should act with autonomy.\n\nMotivation:\n\nOlympus is a community-run DAO in which key decisions affecting the protocol are made by the community. The treasury team implements the community’s decisions through a number of tools, the effective use of which often requires both speed and technical knowledge.\n\nOn the one hand, it is critical that the community is broadly aligned on key decisions. On the other hand, we believe it would be a mistake to require constant community votes on more technical questions, particularly when these technical questions arise in implementing decisions the community has already made.\n\nFramework Proposal:\n\nWe propose adopting the table linked as a general framework to clarify when the treasury team should take action to implement community decisions, and when it must seek specific authorization.\n\nBecause it is difficult to predict in advance every technical treasury issue that may arise, the following list is not intended to be exhaustive. Rather, it should serve as a living document to help everyone in the community understand how decisions are made.\n\nProposed Guidelines & Allocations limits\n\nTreasury is also proposing the following guidelines & allocations to the community. Those have been drafted using the Treasury framework presented above as a baseline.\n\nLink to allocation & treasury framework table: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/1003-oip-73-treasury-framework\n\nThis table will supersede the framework presented in OIP-54. Note that ETH constitutes a reserve asset and will also be subject to the applicable guidelines. Lastly, while it is not always clear whether an asset is centralized or not, we believe that the strategies targeted by the Treasury team should make that criterion unambiguous. As an example, any treasury asset mixed with 3crv token (USDC,DAI,USDT) would be subject to that allocation limit.\n\nPoll: Approve the Treasury framework & the guidelines and allocation limits proposed\n\nOption 1: Yes\nOption 2: Approve the framework only\nOption 3: Do not approve\n",

      "title": "OIP-69 : Whitelisting of “Thecosomata.sol” as an “OHMDEBTOR”",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThe Thecosomata (Sea Butterfly) Treaty is a proposal by REDACTED CARTEL, an Olympus SubDAO, to use Olympus’s sOHM collateralized debt facility to borrow OHM to create more OHM : BTRFLY LP at a faster rate than LP bonds. On the Olympus side, it requires gOHM holders to approve the whitelisting of a specialist contract, called “Thecosomata.sol” to borrow OHM as needed (an OHMDEBTOR), to add LP. Thecosomata.sol will self-impose a 50% LTV limit.\n\nMotivation\n\nREDACTED CARTEL needs to greatly increase it’s POL to market cap ratio to offer cool defi products to it’s holders, such as lending/borrowing facilities, and grow its treasury. Currently the POL/MCap ratio is hovering around 6%, which is a third of what we need it to be. \n\nWith our market cap rising to $550M just 3 weeks after our TBE, we feel our existing LP bonds, which increase POL by $3M aren’t moving quickly enough. This is further exemplified by the majority of BTRFLY trade volume going through a competing ETH : BTRFLY pool on Uniswap V3. Assuming our market cap stayed the same while we waited for LP bonds to beef up POL, we would be in limbo for the next 3 weeks. 3 weeks in DeFi is like 3 months IRL. \n\nThus, we need a quicker solution. Zeus recommended we consider a feature available in Olympus’s V2 Treasury - the incurDebt() function. This function enables us to borrow OHM on our sOHM collateral, provided we are whitelisted. Whilst there is an explicit debt limit configurable for each client of this facility - we are willing to voluntarily impose a 50% LTV limit as well.\n\nWe have roughly $19M of sOHM (67K sOHM) in our treasury (as of 8th January 2022), with a 50% TVL, we would be able to borrow $9.5M upfront to create $19M worth of liquidity. This amount would grow over time as we receive staking rewards on our sOHM. In addition, this could be supplemented by bonding OHM instead of LP, enabling us to grow LP at a minimum of the same rate - while capturing future upside on the asset we are bonding. This upside would enable us to borrow more in the future to create liquidity. \n\nProposal \n\nREDACTED CARTEL request that Thecosomata.sol, a special purpose contract being build to access Olympus DAO debt facility to create POL, is whitelisted for the “OHMDEBTOR” role. This would enable it to borrow OHM using sOHM as collateral.\n\nBorrowing Parameters :\n\nAn initial absolute borrowing limit of 100K OHM\n\nA self-imposed 50% LTV limit, within Thecosomata.sol that can only be increased in cooperation with Olympus DAO\n\nDaily Operation of Thecosomata (while REDACTED POL < 20% BTRFLY Mcap) :\n\nMint BTRFLY equivalent to 0.5% of current total supply\n\nBorrow matching amount of OHM\n\nMint OHM : BTRFLY Sushiswap LP\n\nTransfer LP back to treasury\n\nAlongside this :\n\nLP bonds will be turned off, whilst Thecosomata is active and POL < 20% MCap\n\nOHM bonds will be pushed as the primary bonds within REDACTED whilst POL < 20% Mcap\n\nOnce POL hits 20% of MCap, REDACTED will begin diversifying bonds\n\n\nPoll\n\nFor:  Whitelist Redacted\n\nAgainst: Take no Action",

      "content": "Goal: \nLiquidity for gOHM on Fantom is lacking and prevents Exodia from adding gOHM bonds. Exodia wants to kickstart a gOHM Beets pool by trading $300K DAI from its treasury for $300K of gOHM on Fantom. The currently suggested pool composition will be gOHM-[stable coin]-FTM-wsEXOD-EXOD. The initial liquidity of this pool will be about $1.5M. If our latest proposal passes the stable coin will be MAI otherwise it will be DAI. Beethoven X is an official fork of balancer on Fantom, which focuses on trading efficiency, unique investment pools, and ecosystem collaborations.\n\nWe want to add more gOHM to our treasury by adding gOHM bonds and to do so bonders need to have easy access to gOHM so they can bond without having to bring the funds from another chain. Seeding a Beethoven X pool will give us the necessary liquidity to start the bonding process and we will keep adding liquidity to this pool as this will be our main liquidity pool. The trading fees will also bring a revenue stream to Exodia.\n\nAdding gOHM liquidity and gOHM bonds will help bring us closer to the Olympus community that has helped create us. This also helps us grow hand in hand with OHM and create a more symbiotic ecosystem among the large OHMie community, of which Exodia is a piece of. We will also move a majority of the liquidity from SpookySwap to Beethoven to take full advantage of this switch, the remaining liquidity on SpookySwap will simply be to help communicate price action between the Beets pool and Coinmarketcap, Coingecko or people using those APIs. We expected to reduce the liquidity to roughly $20k.\n\nThe current liquidity available for gOHM on Fantom creates unreasonable slippage to buy from the market which would decrease the liquidity we can offer to Olympus. By doing the trade OTC we can get the maximum amount of gOHM which can go towards the liquidity.\n\n\nVote: \nFor:  Sell 300k DAI worth of gOHM in order to seed the EXODIA BEETS liquidity Pool on Fantom.\nAgainst: Don't do anything",

Debt DAO will provide Olympus with 3.33% of its governance token at launch, which it can use to stake and take part in the governance of Debt DAO. Olympus commits that it will not reduce its exposure to Debt DAO’s governance token and will provide advice and assistance to Debt DAO as it launches and builds out its roadmap. We are posting this OIP after the AMA and the request for comment post: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/816-request-for-comment-debtdao-x-olympus-partnership\n\nMotivation\n\nOur motivation for wanting to align Debt DAO and Olympus is because we share the same values. Olympus and its community have a laser focused mission, value integrity and decentralization, and play positive sum games - those are values we share and hope to embed in our community.\n\nOur protocols are complimentary - on its journey to being the decentralized reserve currency - Olympus will need partners to assist it in managing excess treasury reserves to earn yield - Debt DAO aims to be able to fill that need through its debt borrowing aggregation.\n\nKeeping part of our treasury in gOHM will align Olympus’ success with ours - and vice versa - where Olympus holds our governance token. \n\nProposal\n\nFollowing discussions with the Olympus DAO partnerships contributors - we propose the following partnership with Olympus to align our communities from launch and into the longer term:\n\nDebt DAO provides:\n\n3.33% of governance token to Olympus - vested linearly over 18 months - so Olympus can take part in our governance - on the condition that Olympus retains and does not dispose of these tokens\n\nWe propose to conduct our launch LBP in OHM using Olympus LBP funding - with intention to hold a portion of treasury and liquidity in gOHM\n\nPriority for Debt DAO to integrate OHM as a lending option into its products, following OHM’s current early growth phase\n\nPriority access for Olympus to use our products to generate income for its stablecoin treasury from our borrowing system\n\n\nOlympus Provides:\n\nRecognition of Debt DAO as an aligned partner\n\nPriority access to Olympus’ launch and liquidity products\n\nAdvice and assistance with our launch from Olympus DAO contributors and consultation on our roadmap and strategy into the future\n\nParticipation in our governance (likely through a delegate)\n\nCo-marketing for our upcoming LBP in OHM\n\nFeeless use of Olympus LBP funding\n\nRecommendation of Debt DAO’s products to appropriate partners and users accessing Olympus products\n\nConsideration of integrating of Debt DAO products to Olympus Pro front-end - provided they are suitably brand appropriate and mature\n\nVote:\n\nFor: Engage in Debt DAO Partnership\nAgainst: Don't do anything\n",

      "content": "Summary\nUmami Finance is asking for OlympusDAO’s support for a proposed partnership to accelerate gOHM liquidity on the Arbitrum network and establish OHM as the dominant reserve currency for Arbitrum’s growing ecosystem.\n\nUmami Finance is an Arbitrum-native protocol that provides a suite of infrastructure for scaling liquidity on Arbitrum, including wholly-owned treasury assets, market-making LP deployments, and affiliated DeFi projects.\n\nYou can read more about what we are trying to build here.\n\nMotivation\nUmami Finance seeks to support the focus of Olympus being the core reserve currency of DeFi by attracting additional liquidity and adoption on the Arbitrum chain. $UMAMI is not another reserve currency, nor is it fighting for liquidity or market share with Olympus. Where Olympus seeks risk-free value to back its treasury, Umami Finance takes a market-making approach to its treasury strategy, in addition to supporting protocols and infrastructure that do not currently exist on Arbitrum.\n\nArbitrum is an Optimistic rollup built on the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network. It has attracted more than $2.5 billion in TVL in a short few months since launch. The Arbitrum network is poised to see a dramatic uptick in TVL and usage as it rolls out its planned Nitro upgrade, which will lower its gas fees even further and position it as a leader among L2 scaling networks for Ethereum.\n\nYou can read more about Arbitrum here.\n\nBy bonding gOHM and gOHM-paired LPs, Umami is well positioned to lock gOHM liquidity brought to Arbitrum, ensuring deep and lasting OHM liquidity on the network. Umami can also accelerate migration of gOHM liquidity to Arbitrum through its bond issuances and its partnerships with interoperability protocols.\n\nWhat Umami Needs From OHMies\nThe faster OlympusDAO can help Umami scale cross-liquidity between UMAMI and gOHM, the faster the Umami team can help establish gOHM liquidity on Arbitrum. The first step for an OlympusDAO and Umami Finance partnership would involve establishing a large UMAMI-gOHM trading pool on an Arbitrum exchange.\n\nUmami will take $1 million equivalent of UMAMI tokens from its treasury and provide that to the OHM treasury. In turn, OHM would need to devote $1 million equivalent in gOHM to pair with the UMAMI to build an UMAMI-gOHM LP on Arbitrum.\n\nUmami’s Value Add\nUmami is preparing to offer a variety of gOHM-paired LP bonds that it will utilize to support OHM’s growth on Arbitrum.\n\nUmami will commit to keeping >25% of its treasury composed of gOHM and gOHM pairs. It will build liquidity pairs to support gOHM trading liquidity across multiple assets, including gOHM-ETH.\n\nUmami will provide $1 million in UMAMI tokens to OlympusDAO for it to use to build a gOHM-UMAMI trading pool on SushiSwap. The OlympusDAO treasury will hold the SLP tokens from this pool, giving it upside from exchange fees and UMAMI token appreciation.\n\nUmami will swap its current primary UMAMI-MIM LP for UMAMI-gOHM once gOHM-ETH has $20M in liquidity on Arbitrum. The MIM in the UMAMI-MIM LP at the time of writing is worth approximately $1.5M. To assist in reaching that target, Umami will adjust its BCVs to make gOHM-ETH its second highest bonding priority after the UMAMI token LP itself. Umami will achieve this swap by market buying gOHM using the route MIM → ETH on Arbitrum and then executing an OTC ETH → gOHM swap with OlympusDAO.\n\nThrough its relationship with Arbi’s Finance, Umami is developing and launching other DeFi protocols on Arbitrum to generate new use cases for gOHM on the network and help attract more liquidity to Arbitrum. When Umami rolls out its collateralized lending protocol by January, it will position gOHM as the protocol’s primary collateral asset.\n\nVote:\n\nFor: Engage in partnership with Umami Finance\nAgainst: Don't do anything",

      "title": "OIP-62A: Liquidity Proposal ",
      "content": "Olympus DAO pioneered protocol owned liquidity, and liquidity is in many ways at the core of the protocol and the DAO. One key treasury initiative is to use concentrated liquidity to enable deep liquidity in the Defi landscape - across protocols, side chains and layer 2 solutions. The concentrated liquidity project is now at a stage where it’s possible to start migrating part of current Sushi and Uniswap v2 liquidity to concentrated liquidity positions on Uniswap v3. In line with the Olympus Policy Framework (OIP-22) and the updated Policy Framework (OIP-56), a community vote is needed to add new treasury assets and add liquidity positions on new platforms (such as Uniswap).\n\nMotivation\n\nThe overall aim of this proposal is to initialize and seed Uniswap v3 concentrated liquidity pools and set up tooling and processes for concentrated liquidity management at Olympus. Liquidity management is, and will continue to be, a big topic with many moving parts. To keep tempo high the liquidity team is proposing a stepwise approach where processes and ways of working are built with limited risk. Once these processes are in place and better tooling is developed, high level goals can be set and larger positions can be moved or added.\n\nThe aim of the first three points below is to initialize, seed and deploy capital to leverage concentrated liquidity positions on Uniswap v3.\n\nThe aim of the fourth point is to enable deep liquidity on Uniswap v3 by leveraging concentrated positions and treasury OHM. OHM can be used to provide matching liquidity depth above the range of any concentrated positions. This will ensure full range liquidity and allows for much higher capital efficiency in other liquidity positions.\n\nProposal\n\n1. Migration of OHM-FRAX according to OIP-26\n\nThe migration of OHM-FRAX liquidity from Uniswap v2 to Uniswap v3 was already proposed and accepted in OIP-26. This is just a confirmation that tooling and internal processes have been developed and a stepwise migration will now be done.\n\nActions:\n\nCreation of Uniswap v3 OHM-FRAX pools and initiate stepwise migration of current Uniswap v2 liquidity.\n2. OHM liquidity on Uniswap\n\nAs a first step towards deep Uniswap V3 liquidity pools on Ethereum, we propose that two Uniswap v3 pools, OHM-DAI and OHM-ETH, be set up and seeded after OHM-FRAX. This ensures the new pools are ready, balanced and provides us with an opportunity to study potential trade volume, routing, arbitrage and ability to capture trading fees on Uniswap. The proposal seeks permission to move up to $10M of liquidity from each Sushi pair to Uniswap v3.\n\nTo capture the full potential of deep liquidity and trading routes on one platform, permission is also asked to whitelist all current liquidity pools on Uniswap and to move liquidity between Sushi and Uniswap as the need arises.\n\n$10M in the OHM-DAI pool is 2.8% of the Sushi liquidity for the pair. $10M in the OHM-ETH pool is 8.2% of the Sushi liquidity as of December 10, 2021.\n\nActions:\n\nPermission to move OHM pools between Sushi and Uniswap as the need arises\n\nCreate OHM-ETH and OHM-DAI pools and vaults on Uniswap v3\n\nMigrate up to $10M from OHM-DAI on Sushi to OHM-DAI on Uniswap v3\n\nMigrate up to $10M from OHM-ETH on Sushi to OHM-ETH on Uniswap v3\n\n**\n3. Enable and seed L2 liquidity on Uniswap**\n\nProteus’s (OIP-45) goal is to seed gOHM liquidity across chains and L2’s using mining incentives. This action point aims to prepare Olympus to deploy deep liquidity on supported L2’s by leveraging concentrated liquidity on Uniswap v3. However, cross chain OHM is not launched yet and the utility of OHM on L2 is small at the moment. For example, both Arbitrum and Optimism have low activity compared to Ethereum L1. Therefore, only a limited amount of up to $1M in each target pool will be migrated. $1M is 0.28% of the current OHM-DAI Sushi liquidity and 0.82% of the current Sushi OHM-ETH liquidity.\n\nActions:\n\nCreate Uniswap v3 pools for OHM-DAI and OHM-ETH on Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nMigrate up to $1M from OHM-DAI on Sushi to OHM-DAI on Uniswap v3 on both Arbitrum and Optimism\n\nMigrate up to $1M from OHM-ETH on Sushi to OHM-ETH on Uniswap v3 on both Arbitrum and Optimism\n\n4. Permission to deploy OHM for liquidity provision use\nTreasury and/or DAO OHM can be used to provide single-sided liquidity above the current market price in Uniswap v3 pools. By earmarking OHM for liquidity provision use, the Olympus treasury team gets a clearer long term view of OHM needs and the liquidity team can develop processes and gradually deploy OHM to match the new Uniswap v3 positions described above.\n\nThe earmarked OHM is calculated to enable a duplication of the present Sushi liquidity depth for OHM-DAI and OHM-ETH on Uniswap v3. At current prices, 250k OHM is needed. Future liquidity migration from Sushi will be combined with LP bonds to ensure that liquidity is not fragmented and at least the current depth is maintained.\n\nActions:\n\nPermission to deploy up to 250k OHM for liquidity provision use in OHM-DAI and OHM-ETH pools on Uniswap L1, Uniswap Arbitrum and Uniswap Optimism.",

      "content": "Summary:\n\nUpdate the framework from OIP-22 distinguishing between (1) key policy decisions that require a community vote from (2) technical levers that the policy team uses with autonomy to implement community decisions and ensure the ongoing health and stability of the protocol.\n\nMotivation:\n\nAs Olympus has grown, the technical levers used by the policy team have become more complex, and now include Olympus Pro, the v2 bond contract, v3 liquidity pools and potential cross-chain deployments with some liquidity mining incentives. The new bond contract is particularly important to reflect in the updated framework: because the new contract does not allow changes to certain bond terms once a bond is launched, it is important that the policy team be able to launch and deprecate bonds to maintain the level of agility mandated by the community in OIP-22.\n\nV2 of the Policy Framework seeks to reflect these developments.\n\nProposal:\n\nWe propose updating the table below as a general framework to clarify when the policy team should take action to implement community decisions, and when it must seek specific authorization.\n\nBecause it is difficult to predict in advance every technical policy issue that may arise, the following list is not intended to be exhaustive. Rather, it should serve as a living document to help everyone in the community understand how decisions are made.\n\n\n\nMore context can be found on the Olympus proposal forum post:\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/622-oip-56-olympusdao-policy-framework-v2",

As a growing community that has very serious aspirations,  we have to do something to resolve this issue. It is not only nefarious to our ability to communicate but also to the image of this project. \n\n1)\nThe classic proposition that I see is to put a minimum balance required to publish propositions. I do not believe this is a fair proposition, it is widely undemocratic, to say the least. It will render the community governance narrative obsolete as only a few will be able to voice their ideas. \n\nThe second method is a slicing method that financially punishes spam propositions. Everything considered this option does seem like the most attractive to me. \n\nIndeed, Olympus would have to create an obligatory present voting poll \"spam\". If OHMIES believe this prop is spam then they will vote in the \"SPAM\" poll.\n\nIf the spam answer to the snapshot is higher than 90% the author will lose their s/gOHM\n\n\nThis OHM could be used by the DAO to reward the authors of the best proposals of the month (measured in the number of total votes or a voting poll with the best proposal of the month could be created, first takes 50%, second takes 30% third takes 20%). \n\n2) TLDR:\nNo minimum OHM balance to create a proposal, however, authors of spam propositions that will be flagged by the obligatory extra voting option \"spam\" (90%<) will lose their s/gOHM which will be placed in a wallet that will be used to reward the authors with the best proposals of the month (measured in the number of total votes or through an official vote of the best prop of the month). \n",

      "content": "Enable the purchasing of bonds using the top X  tokens by market capitalization, excluding BTC and ETH which require standalone decisions due to their massive market caps, with an allowance of Y% of marginal treasury growth S, with the token selection updating every Z epochs. Marginal treasury growth in this context implies the expected increase in treasury balance over the period Z, measured in epochs. \nX, Y, Z to be chosen at the developers discretion, S to be calculated according to past returns, with calculation parameters at the developers discretion. \n\nExample (X=5, Y=0.05, Z=21, S=1,000,000$): \nSuppose at time T0, the top 5 capitalized tokens aside from BTC and ETH are K1, K2, K3, K4, K5, and the expected treasury growth over 21 epochs is 1,000,000$ (fiat used for convenience of discussion). \n\nAt T0, a \"bond slot\" is allocated for tokens K1-K5, where the total capacity of the slot is determined by SLOT=Y*S. In this example, assuming suggested values for X,Y,Z are used, we have SLOT=0.05*1,000,000$=50,000$.\n\nFor the period T0-T1, where T1=T0+Z*8, the protocol offers bonds on K1-K5, with discount rates floating to incentivize a token intake that is proportional to the market cap of K1-K5. \n\nIf at any time the value of bonds sold exceeds the \"bond slot\", no further bonds are issued. \n\nMotivation:\nSuch a system will enable diversification of treasury assets, and growth of its assets as the entire cryptocurrency world grows. Given that future adoption of crypto is a fundamental assumption of any crypto project aside from memes, it makes sense to invest in it. \n\nThis DAO aims to function almost like a central bank, and is already participating in investment activity by staking some of the treasury balance elsewhere. Banks, however, invest a lot more than 5% into \"growth\" assets.  Investing a small proportion of marginal treasury growth into crypto will increase the treasury's upside (and thus our upside), but will not introduce significant risk due to low overall asset allocation, diversification across several high market cap token, and a fast response time to market changes. \n\nOver the long term, if this system is implemented, the treasury can be expected to accumulate a significant, diversified portfolio of non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies, which will enable Olympus not just to back its coin, but also to distribute investment profits to the clients of its \"bank\". \n\n\n",

The Sovryn community is looking for growth opportunities and I think a partnership with them maybe beneficial for their protocol but also provide Olympus with opportunities to strategically capture interest from the Bitcoin user base.

      "content": "Many wallets are posting proposals like ohm to the moon and other bs without any contribution to the ecosystem. Others are asking pointless questions for example \"ohm will moon?\". Of course it will, that is why you bought the bloody thing. I personally hold less than 40 ohm but saw a proposal for only wallets with 100 ohm or more to be able to propose updates/solutions. The problem with this is , even though proposal rights get concentrated in the hands of people who are more incentivized for the dao to succeed, we will be limiting our ideas to a very small group. \nA poorer investor might be very innovative and financial strength shouldn't dictate his good intentioned ability to contribute. Also a proposal to restrict wallets with only 100 ohm to initiate snapshot proposals is against the spirit of decentralized governance and would greatly diminish retail investor confidence potentially causing a price crash. \nInstead what I propose is that a wallet's ability to publish proposals will be striked off if the proposal gets very low engagement. The criteria for low engagement can be decided by the team. Or add a necessary snapshot option for other wallets to vote on striking off a wallet whenever it submits a proposal.\nAnd please do not ruin decentralization by making a place where smaller wallets cannot contribute, very harmful to the ethics of a dao.",

      "title": "OIP-61 Balancer Pool implementation & LBP funding approval",
      "content": "Authors: Mark11 & Json - on behalf of the DAO\n\nSummary\nSeek authority from community governance to launch liquidity on Balancer. Begin liquidity provision with OHM-ETH-DAI (with proposed weights of 50%, 25%, 25% weighted) or OHM-DAI (50%-50% weights) - dependent on liquidity availability during the migration period. The maximum treasury allocation to pool liquidity will be set at $25 million worth of OHM and $12.5 million each of DAI and ETH.\n\nEstablishing a liquidity pool on Balancer will make OHM a liquid asset in that ecosystem and therefore allow new protocols to conduct their initial fundraising denominated in OHM using Balancer LBPs - see: Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) LBP token launch auctions.\n\nThis proposal also seeks authority for the DAO to carry out an LBP funding program in appropriate circumstances. This would involve loaning treasury OHM to approved and vetted partners for the required non-native portion in commencing Balancer LBP pools for initial fundraising (pools would usually start with weights of 5%OHM- 95% governance-token). The loaned OHM will not be provided unless it is to an LBP pool being controlled at all times by a partner multisig with a majority of reputable signers - either individuals or organizations with a verifiable good reputation. A cap of no more than $10 million in OHM would be available to be loaned at any time. Olympus may charge the loaned projects a fee to be paid in the project's native token for the service.\n\nMotivation\nA number of protocols have approached the DAO concerning an intention to conduct their token public auctions in OHM and to date, there has not been sufficient OHM liquidity on the Balancer platform in order to achieve this - establishing an OHM-ETH-DAI liquidity pool would enable this.\n\nThe Balancer liquidity pool established by Olympus would increase the network effects of OHM across another trading venue and further increase volume exposure to OHM, generating pool trading fees.\nEstablishing an OHM-DAI-ETH liquidity pool on Balancer will allow projects to fundraise in OHM and will also earn Olympus pool trading fees. The liquidity pool will require up to $25 million of OHM, $12.5 million each of ETH and DAI from the treasury in the form of LP positions. At the time of writing, the Treasury currently holds $270mm in OHM-DAI and $120mm in OHM-ETH.\n\nWhile it is important to establish liquidity on Balancer so protocols can publicly raise in OHM. One service of further assistance we can provide to reputable and vetted projects is an LBP funding program. All OHM utilized for the LBP funding loan program will come from the DAO. Currently, the DAO holds $598M in OHM. It is imperative that we utilize this OHM to bring value to the Olympus ecosystem. This program would allow Olympus to help facilitate the raising in OHM by lending protocols the non-native pool share of their LBP. \n\nFor example, a project that:\nSeeks to provide 5% of its total supply for LBP\nlaunch with $100 million fully diluted valuation\nhave starting weights of 5%-95%\nWould need just $250,000 worth of OHM to commence its LBP pool.\n\nProviding LBP funding by loaning OHM, would be conditional upon the LBP pool being controlled at all times by a partner multisig with a majority of reputable signers. This would be either individuals or organizations with a verifiable good reputation. A cap of no more than $10 million in OHM would be available to be loaned at any time. Olympus may also charge the loaned projects a fee to be paid in the project's native token to be determined by the DAO. Projects must undergo strict due diligence, conducted by Olympus DAO contributors, prior to being accepted for the LBP funding program. This is in order to ensure that projects and their teams are of sufficient reputation and quality and have sufficient operational security - so there can be satisfaction that they will not pose a risk to Olympus’ reputation.\n\nProposal\nSeek authority from community governance to launch liquidity on Balancer. Begin liquidity provision with OHM-ETH-DAI (with proposed weights of 50%, 25%, 25% weighted) or OHM-DAI (50%-50% weights) - dependent on liquidity availability during the migration period. The maximum treasury allocation to pool liquidity will be set at $25 million worth of OHM and $12.5 million each of DAI and ETH. This proposal will also authorize the DAO Treasury management contributors to decrease or increase (up to the $50 million maximum) the pool to optimize liquidity utilization. Adjustment may be necessary in order for the pool to capture further trading revenue or if the assets are being underutilized to remove them back to the treasury to consolidate our funds. Additionally, request pre-approval to conduct a migration of the Balancer pool to Curve v2 pool - once the Curve v2 pools launch - should the treasury management contributors consider it provides a better solution. The DAO must provide 5 days' notice to the community prior to any pool migration.\n\nAlso, approve the DAO to carry out an LBP funding program. This would involve loaning treasury OHM to approved and vetted partners for the required non-native portion in commencing Balancer LBP pools for initial fundraising (pools would usually start with weights of 5%OHM- 95% governance-token). The loaned OHM will not be provided unless it is to an partner LBP pool being controlled at all times by a multisig with a majority of reputable signers - either independent individuals or organizations with a verifiable good reputation. A cap of no more than $10 million in OHM would be available to be loaned at any time. Olympus may charge the loaned projects a fee to be paid in the project's native token for the service. Projects must undergo strict due diligence, conducted by Olympus DAO contributors, prior to being accepted for the LBP funding program. This is in order to ensure that projects and their teams are of sufficient reputation and quality and have sufficient operational security - so there can be satisfaction that they will not pose a risk to Olympus’ reputation. All loaned OHM must be returned to the treasury upon the finalization of the LBP fundraising pool. The program may include additional security measures considered appropriate by the DAO contributors, including requiring a security deposit.\n\nVote\nFor: Approve Balancer pool & LBP funding program\nAgainst: Do nothing",

Olympus commits that it will not reduce its exposure to PhantomDAO’s governance token.

We are confident that both parties will benefit from this relationship through the  integration of our communities.There are a number of potential areas for further collaboration between Phantom and Olympus, which can be explored at the appropriate time.\n\nShould this proposal pass - we expect to work closely with the Olympus DAO contributors to explore how Phantom Accelerator and Olympus Incubator can mutually benefit from referring applicant dealflow to each other and supporting appropriate projects side by side.\n\nAs it currently stands, there are a couple of areas worth flagging:\nOlympus’ Incubator is a natural alignment for Phantom’s Accelerator program. Phantom can be a powerful partner who can support Olympus on projects that make sense to both communities - simultaneously spreading risk and increasing diversification.\nPhantom inherently increases the demand for OHM by holding gOHM in its treasury. The success of Phantom will ultimately put upward pressure on OHM’s price and ultimately increase OHM’s runway by maintaining a higher premium in the market.\nOlympus directly holding 3.33% of Phantom’s supply and voting influence.\n\nIn the future, we envision ways to deepen this partnership through DAO-to-DAO swaps and other mechanisms which we will be open to exploring with both communities' input.\n\nWhat else do we ask of the OHMies?\nOutside of the above, it is our hope that both communities can harmoniously exist and mix with one another. Phantom already has a great number of OG OHMies involved who understand the ecosystem and are extremely supportive of this proposal.\n\nWe would like to be Olympus’ de-facto partner on the Fantom chain and continue to propagate all of the positive externalities Olympus has created over time while being more agile in our yield strategies, seeking to provide support to up-and-coming web3.0 founders that seek to broaden crypto’s reach and exposure.\n\nProposal\nFormalize a partnership to integrate and align PhantomDAO and Olympus - by endorsing PhantomDAO as a partner project within the Fantom ecosystem.

PhantomDAO also proposes to have 10% of its initial treasury to be held in gOHM with the intention to increase that percentage - subject to approval of community governance.\n\nFor further background of this proposal please see OIP-59 forum proposal and discussion here https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/655-oip-59-partnership-with-phantomdao \n\nMotivation\nWe are committed to aligning with Olympus as a community as we believe our values are shared. We are confident that both parties will benefit from this relationship through the  integration of our communities.There are a number of potential areas for further collaboration between Phantom and Olympus, which can be explored at the appropriate time.\n\nShould this proposal pass - we expect to work closely with the Olympus DAO contributors to explore how Phantom Accelerator and Olympus Incubator can mutually benefit from referring applicant dealflow to each other and supporting appropriate projects side by side.\n\nAs it currently stands, there are a couple of areas worth flagging:\nOlympus’ Incubator is a natural alignment for Phantom’s Accelerator program. Phantom can be a powerful partner who can support Olympus on projects that make sense to both communities - simultaneously spreading risk and increasing diversification.\nPhantom inherently increases the demand for OHM by holding gOHM in its treasury. The success of Phantom will ultimately put upward pressure on OHM’s price and ultimately increase OHM’s runway by maintaining a higher premium in the market.\nOlympus directly holding 3.33% of Phantom’s supply and voting influence.\n\nIn the future, we envision ways to deepen this partnership through DAO-to-DAO swaps and other mechanisms which we will be open to exploring with both communities' input.\n\nWhat else do we ask of the OHMies?\nOutside of the above, it is our hope that both communities can harmoniously exist and mix with one another. Phantom already has a great number of OG OHMies involved who understand the ecosystem and are extremely supportive of this proposal.\n\nWe would like to be Olympus’ de-facto partner on the Fantom chain and continue to propagate all of the positive externalities Olympus has created over time while being more agile in our yield strategies, seeking to provide support to up-and-coming web3.0 founders that seek to broaden crypto’s reach and exposure.\n\nProposal\nFormalize a partnership to integrate and align PhantomDAO and Olympus - by endorsing PhantomDAO as a partner project within the Fantom ecosystem. PhantomDAO will provide Olympus with 3.33% of its governance token at launch which it can use to stake and take part in the governance of PhantomDAO. Olympus commits that it will not reduce its exposure to PhantomDAO’s governance token. PhantomDAO also proposes to have 10% of its initial treasury to be held in gOHM with the intention to increase that percentage - subject to approval of community governance.\n\nPolling Period\nThe polling process begins now and will run for at least 24 hours. After this, a Snapshot vote will be initiated and open for at least 48 hours.\n\nPoll\nFor: Approve the proposed partnership\nAgainst: Do nothing\n",

We are working on a product suite which aims to provide collaboration-as-a-service, which include: \nMotivation\nAfter discussions with the Olympus Partnerships contributors - PrimeDAO seeks to partner with Olympus asking for a swap of $250k in OHM - in return for 500k Prime Tokens (0.5% supply). Olympus would join Gitcoin and Balancer - who are proposed to partner with PrimeDAO on similar terms - subject to each’s governance vote.\nOlympusDAO is one of the DAOs we have been in close contact with, as we integrated some of the Olympus DAO contributors’  valuable feedback into our process for researching and designing Prime Deals. \nAs we move forward with our PRIME ($D2D) token launch, we want to signal our intent to make PrimeDAO a DAO co-habitation space by sharing ownership and securing long-term alignment with DAOs we will be closely working with. So, we are hoping to do token swaps with our strategic partners. \n\nOur partnership will set the stage for a strong collaboration between Olympus and Prime as we work towards becoming the primary coordination stream for DAOs. OHM wants to be the liquidity bridge/backend of the whole ecosystem. Olympus can utilize PrimeDAO as a coordination vehicle in calling a DeFi alliance and to strengthen the plasticity of ecosystem liquidity. By partnering with PrimeDAO, Olympus will be a leading voice in the creation of DAO2DAO products that enhance its offering and deal making mechanics, while supporting PrimeDAO’s push towards becoming a DAO co-habitation space. \n\nProposal \nFormalize a partnership with Olympus by conducting a token swap of $250k in OHM from a 30 day TWAP from the date of execution of this proposal - in return for 500k Prime Tokens being 0.5% supply at a $50 million fully diluted valuation of PrimeDAO.\nEach protocol undertakes to not reduce its holding or exposure to the swapped tokens for at least a period until 1 January 2023.\nEach protocol may stake the swapped tokens in order to participate in the other's governance.\nEach protocol commits to explore further collaborations into the future.\n\nPoll\nFor: Execute token swap.\nAgainst: Do nothing.\n",

Please check that out before voting: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/540-oip-55-olympus-grants-program\n\n---\n\n### Proposal\n\nApprove Olympus Grants Program pilot with a budget of $1.5 million from DAO reserved OHM for a trial period of 3.3 months.\n\nThe committee suggests utilisation of DAO reserved OHM for the OGP fund is of most benefit to the DAO as the idle unstaked OHM are getting diluted by > $10M per day (assuming steady market price). If an enticing enough proposal is presented the community can vote on utilizing additional assets.\n\nThe program will be overseen by a committee of 7 DAO contributors known in the community from different departments within the DAO are:\n\n* Apollo (Olympus Initiator)\n* Appleseed (Engineering)\n* Brian (Sherpa, Community & Content)\n* Church (Product & Marketing for Odyssey)\n* DropKickDarren (Community & Content)\n* Json (Operations, Partnerships & Treasury)\n* WollemiPine (Partnerships, Community & Content, Engineering)\n\nAll decisions will be voted on by committee with minimum of 4 of 7 votes for a grant to proceed. Voting will be made public and available to the wider  DAO. The process and assessment criteria will be transparent and published as part of establishing this MVP.\n\nOGP will launch with the following initial priorities:\n\n1. Education - projects that educate people about Olympus\n2. Infrastructure - projects that improve infrastructure of Olympus\n3. Utility - projects that increase utility of OHM\n\n### Wrap UP\n\nUnused funds from the OGP v0.1 would be rolled over into the next iteration of OGP, with approval of the community, or returned to the DAO pending a future vote.\n\nAt the end of the funding runway, the OGP committee will provide a report concerning the program.\n\nAfter receiving feedback from the community, the OGP committee will propose adjustments and parameters for an ongoing program and then proceed to a governance vote. During this process, the program committee and DAO will continue to be able to work with existing grantees - as long as it remains within the approved $1.5 million expenditure cap.\n\n### Vote\n\n1. Yes - approve Olympus Grants Program (OGP) administered by the DAO\n2. No - do not approve Olympus Grants Program at this time",

Olympus' future is long term and to be an expansive protocol adapting to fundamental value creation it seems wise to consider other stablecoins for the  treasury to open the doors to additional yield opportunities as they expand in the future (e.g Looping MIM and UST through Anchor and Abra for 100+% yield)\n\nAccumulating $UST and $MIM allows for massive yield opportunities on the risk free value of treasury stables, which is an important floor to raise over time as APY slows and the protocols matures into relative stability.\n\nThis could be an important step as Olympus now has the treasury means to slowly expand beyond DAI.\n\nShould Olympus accumulate $MIM or $UST?",

With OHM-LUSD and LUSD bonds depreciated, there is room for a new reserve asset that we can add to further diversify our treasury.\n\n### Proposal\n* Introduce UST reserve bonds to diversify the treasury and hedge against centralized stablecoin risks. We will target 3.3% of our RFV to be UST. If we exceed 5% of our RFV, UST bonds will be shut off (similarly to LUSD) to promote healthy market growth.\n* Allow for Terra to purchase a $1m bond to co-market both communities and establish a symbolic relationship.\n\n### Vote\n**For:** Add UST to the Treasury via reserve bonds\n**Against:** Don’t add UST to the Treasury",

      "content": "The race towards efficient and cost-effective semi-conductor appliances can be a potential investment opportunity and for acquiring more liquid assets. Given the current trends in semiconductor technologies & the severe competition between dominating manufacturers such as Intel, AMD, etc. versus upcoming companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC, https://www.tsmc.com/) and ASML Holding N.V. (https://www.asml.com/en), Olympus DAO may also focus its attention on acquiring liquid assets which (seems to) promise long-term ROI on current trends.\n\nBoth TSMC & ASML have shown a linear upward trend with a positive Moving Average (1 Yr, 2 Yrs) indicating an uprise in their manufactured products and public awareness. Therefore, it would be a good step for Olympus DAO to contemplate on high-risk-high-reward assets as they may also accumulate higher value at a later period (which may, in turn, boost the initial ROI).\n\nProposal: Identify & debate on acquiring liquid stock assets which seem promising in the next 2-3 Years, initially with TSMC & ASML, given the current market trends, and slowly diversify acquired assets into more contemporary market demands, examples such as AI, nanotechnology, health & pharmaceutical, etc.\n",

      "title": "OIP-54: Stablecoin Farming Amendment",
      "content": "Summary: We are seeking approval from the community to allocate up to 50% of excess reserves into previously whitelisted protocols and add to the whitelist. Excess reserves are treasury assets which are not used to back OHM currently in circulation.\n\nThe OlympusDAO treasury continues to grow and accrue larger amounts of assets that can be utilized to generate passive yield income for all Ohmies. To help increase the rate of RFV growth and backing per OHM, the Treasury team feels it is the right time to allocate a greater amount toward whitelisted protocols.\n\nThis expansion of the OIP-20 framework will continue to enable agile treasury asset management while also creating significantly higher yield on idle assets. The proposal laid out below is to give the DAO the mandate to allocate up to 50% of excess reserves into whitelisted protocols approved by the community (currently Compound, Aave, Convex, and Sushiswap) and to approve an additional protocol for the whitelist, Rari Capital.\n\nMotivation: In OIP-20 the community approved the usage of up to 33% of excess reserve assets, the Treasury team wants to expand this effort to 50% with this proposal. At the time of writing the Olympus treasury contains $776,356,715 dollars in market value, and $175,531,939 value in risk free value. Currently, the DAO only utilizes 33% of this or $57m.\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce a framework which would allow the DAO to increase the allocation up to 50% of excess treasury reserves in whitelisted protocols. By proposing a % as opposed to a fixed sum, it will allow the DAO to reduce overhead and numerous votes while pursuing an active role in our treasury management. This in essence makes the DAO more efficient.\n\nOne last important note is that these treasury assets can only be used in whitelisted protocols which have been voted on by the DAO. This currently only includes Compound, Aave, Convex and Sushiswap but can be extended. The Treasury Team would like to extend that whitelist with Rari Capital.\n\nDescription from info.rari.capital: Rari Capital is a suite of decentralized finance protocols on a mission to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical minds, in order to bring the next wave of mass users into this industry.\n\nRari Fuse is an open and decentralized interest rate protocol that supports isolated interest rate pools, allowing pool creators to create customisable isolated interest rate money markets of any assets and allowing users to lend and borrow digital assets.\n\nRisks: Rari Fuse pools can be customized with dangerous parameters especially if they use a bad oracle, or incorporate unsafe assets into the pool with little liquidity. \n\nFor example, if the price of assets crash significantly, and liquidation bots fail to keep up with the liquidation of the uncollateralized position, the pool might become undercollateralized and depositors might not be able to withdraw the full value of their deposits.\n\nProtocol Analysis: Using a risk analysis framework developed by the DAO, the Policy and Partnerships teams have attempted to score various protocols based on some subjective and non-subjective data. Rari Capital scored 18. The subjective values were derived from averaging the votes of multiple DAO members.\n\nProposal: Allow the DAO to allocate up to 50% of excess treasury reserves in whitelisted protocols and to whitelist Rari Capital.\n\nOption 1: Increase excess reserve allocation and whitelist Rari Capital.\nOption 2: Only increase excess reserves.\nOption 3: Only whitelist Rari Capital.\nOption 4: Don’t increase excess reserve allocation and don't whitelist Rari Capital.",

      "content": "### Summary\n\nExecute a DAO swap with Frax Finance for $3m FXS at a 30-day time-weighted average price.\n\n### Motivation\n\nFrax Finance needs no introduction to the Olympus community. Our partnership started back in May with FRAX bonds, and was further deepened by them joining our Olympus Pro pilot program as one of the first partners showing faith in our new product.\n\nAt the moment, the Olympus Treasury holds more than $48m in FRAX reserves and OHM-FRAX liquidity. We are already clearly aligned with the success of Frax and by executing a DAO swap for FXS we would have a larger say in the governance as well.\n\n### Proposal\n\nExecute a DAO swap with Frax Finance for $3m FXS at a 30-day time-weighted average price. The 30-day TWAP is what Olympus uses for all its DAO swaps, so that we don’t seem opportunistic or trying to time it based on short-term price action. The reference date for the price would be the end of their Snapshot vote - Nov 30, 2021, 20:00 UTC (so 30-day TWAP from that point). \n\nThe intended usage of the FXS is to lock as veFXS to maximize participation in Frax's governance.\n\nThe community has already given the DAO permissions to pursue (but not execute) DAO swaps with Frax Finance, as per OIP-19.\n\n### Vote\n\nFor: Execute DAO swap\n\nAgainst: Don't execute DAO swap\n\nForum post for additional discussion and context:\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/506-oip-53-execute-dao-swap-with-frax-finance",

The idea is that we have two at the current price of Ohm to wEthereum with a specific expiration date, then have a long Ohm that is above the current price so that if Ethereum spikes then it will convert to APY.  Then have the opposite Ohm to Ethereum or vice versa to where the APY if Ethereum drops, it will convert to APY.\n\nI don't think I got the concept right but I know there are smarter more capable people here that could take this idea of having multiple bonds  of the same asset but at different OHM prices, could actually cause more stability and even further push us away from having to use pegged assets in order to maintain a stable coin.  The use of multiple bonds in a strategic manner could stabilize the currency even more and convert volatility even more into an APY while the coin itself stays flat.\n\n",

That will take some time to develop, discuss, and build out. We will submit a request for comment in the near future on this.\n\nIn the meantime, we propose to immediately shift to a simple max-per-capita flexible budget. This will allow us to expand our teams sustainably, while enforcing a Max Per Month ceiling on position contribution payments.\n\n\nProposal\n\n- Compensate Apollo 260 OHM for his advance stopgap payment for October\n\n- Amendment A addition: formalize a monthly project payment multisig, which will hold a maximum of $250,000. The DAO multisig will fund a 6 of 10 Stratego multisig for these projects. The Stratego multisig will then be responsible for making milestone payments to each project contributor, as milestones are reached.\n\n- Implement a flexible per-capita budget, effective starting in the November epoch, according to the table below. Amendment A addition: individual contributors are globally limited to $30,000 per month.\n\n\nMore context can be found on the forum:\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/479-oip-47a-amendment-to-olympus-stopgap-budget-proposal\n\n\n\nVOTE: Implement flexible per-capita budget according to the table above, set up the Stratego multisig for projects (limited to $250,000), and pay Apollo back for October pay bump.",

      "title": "OIP 51: Strategic Asset Whitelist",
      "content": "Summary: Seek authority from the community to acquire strategic assets that will help Olympus strengthen its prevalence throughout DeFi. This allows Olympus to significantly increase our passive revenue generation, acquire governance power and increase the diversification of treasury assets.\n\nThese assets will be acquired through bonds, DAO swaps and/or direct market orders using funds from a newly created investment reserve towards which a portion of the overall bond capacity will be redirected. For clarity, we will not market sell OHM to achieve this.\n\nTo ensure best price execution for Olympus, targeted whitelisted assets will not be unveiled until either bonds are live or the Treasury team has completed the purchase. However, the treasury team will evaluate and share the results from the Strategic asset investment framework for each potential strategic asset after execution.\n\nMotivation: When Olympus was in its infancy, the protocol placed a focus on acquiring liquidity and stable assets to bolster the risk free value of the treasury. As the protocol mechanism was new and undiscovered, an emphasis was placed on this metric to provide security and intrinsic value. Today, this has grown to $758,173,633 dollars in market value, and $169,807,441 value in risk free value.\n\nWe believe that Olympus has now acquired enough stable assets backing OHM to begin to diversify and acquire more non-pegged assets, and shift a portion of revenue towards increasing the market value of our treasury. It is no longer about risk aversion, it is about risk management.\n\nWe want to cement our place in DeFi as the de-facto decentralized reserve currency. By acquiring governance power, we can vote on proposals that benefit the Olympus ecosystem. This will allow for the continued growth and expansion of the Olympus ecosystem.We believe that acquiring certain strategic assets will help us achieve this objective.\n\nWith the support of the community, Olympus can acquire strategic assets, and adjust its strategy within DeFi to maximize yield and benefits to OHM.\n\nImportant Notes on strategic investments:\n\nStrategic investments will not be revealed to the community before approval, to avoid front running. Executing these kinds of deals requires some form of trust from the Community. We will be as transparent as possible by sharing results from the Strategic Asset Framework developed by the DAO.\n\nStrategic investments will only be used to purchase what we call utility assets. These are assets that we intend to keep as long as they help Olympus by providing:\n\n        Additional partnerships opportunities\n        Increased influence on liquidity direction\n        Governance power in key protocols\n        Better yield opportunities for our Reserve assets\n        Diversification in market value of treasury\n\nUnlike Reserve assets, utility assets may or may not be sold by Olympus as we continuously re-evaluate their strategic value.\n\nWe propose to limit the amount of strategic assets we can acquire: the cost basis of our strategic assets must be less than 33% of the RFV of our Treasury.\n\nPotential strategic investments:\n\nFollowing the recent CVX proposal, the Treasury team has compiled a list of potential tokens that we think could provide strategic value to Olympus DAO. These tokens were selected for their yield potential, governance influence and partnership opportunities. The governance power of tokens can lead to greater passive revenue. Greater passive revenue can lead to greater runway and backing of OHM.\n\nAs always, we remain open to any other suggestions coming from the community and we invite any of you to look for other projects that would fit our strategy. Additionally, any of the below assets or any other one for the matter, must still get reviewed by the Treasury team.\n\nToken list:\n\n    TOKE\n    CRV\n    CVX\n    TRIBE\n    FXS\n    RGT\n    MKR\n    ETH\n    LQTY\n\nNote: As the treasury grows and other strategic opportunities arise this list may grow to include more assets. This proposal will be amended and undergo another community vote under that circumstance.\n\nProposal: Allow the Treasury team to autonomously acquire strategic assets on behalf of OlympusDAO. We will limit the Net Asset Cost of our strategic assets to 33% of Treasury RFV.  Keep in mind that Treasury RFV is an extremely conservative metric: At the moment, the market value of our Treasury is $762m, versus $170m RFV.\n\nThis will allow the creation of an investment reserve which would take away some of the bond capacity from Reserve & LP bonds. This proposal will help Olympus acquire assets without front running risk and generate passive revenue.\n\nVote: Allow the Treasury team to acquire strategic assets on behalf of OlympusDAO.",

      "content": "Summary: Swap additional $3mm in OHM from the DAO (~4,000 OHM) with Tokemak for TOKE\n\nBackground: Following CORE #1, the DAO executed a first swap with Tokemak. Thereafter, the DAO also seeded the Tokemak OHM reactor to provide additional future liquidity and earn yield farming rewards. See here and here for the related proposals.\n\nMotivation: Given our strong relationship with Tokemak, the burgeoning demand for TOKE as a strategic asset, and the ability to increase the liquidity provided via the OHM reactor, we propose an additional $3M swap. The DAO will stake the TOKE for additional yield (currently 54% APR) and utilize staked TOKE to vote on CORE events and to direct OHM liquidity once live.\n\nDetails:\nPricing based on 7-day moving average\n$3M TOKE\n$3M OHM\n\nExecute Additional $3M Swap?",

Holding other cryptocurrencies in the treasury is a good hedge against inflation, but still subjects the treasury to the volatility of the these underlying assets. When we enter a bull market, the declining value of crypto assets held in the treasury will have an outsized effect on the price of OHM. I propose that we make 10% of the treasury Tether's Gold Pegged Stablecoin, XAUT, as a hedge against both the inflation of the USD, and the inherent volatility of other crypto assets held in the treasury.

Thereafter, the DAO also seeded the Tokemak OHM reactor to provide additional future liquidity and earn yield farming rewards. See here and here for the related proposals.\n\nMotivation: Given our strong relationship with Tokemak, the burgeoning demand for TOKE as a strategic asset, and the ability to increase the liquidity provided via the OHM reactor, we propose an additional $3M swap. The DAO will stake the TOKE for additional yield (currently 54% APR) and utilize staked TOKE to vote on CORE events and to direct OHM liquidity once live.\n\nDetails:\n\nPricing based on 7-day moving average\n$3M TOKE\n$3M OHM",

      "title": "OIP-46: Implement [REDACTED] as an Olympus Branch",
      "content": "Summary\n\nWe are seeking approval to introduce [REDACTED] as the first official branch of OlympusDAO focused on acquiring CRV, CVX, and other relevant governance tokens to expand Olympus DAOs reach beyond risk-free value and expand into a multi-token ecosystem. You can read more about what we are trying to build here.\n\nMotivation:\n\nIt is fair to say that the protocol currently faces an uphill struggle. As newer protocols based on similar architecture come to market with their own promises of colossal returns and slightly altered narratives, the focus of Olympus being the core reserve currency of DeFi face an existential threat where forks distract not only liquidity but adoption of the protocol elsewhere.  While it is easy to celebrate the protocol as a success when it is rapidly expanding, true tests will come when growth slows. $BTRFLY (Redacteds rebasing governance token), is not another reserve currency, nor is it fighting for liquidity or market share with Olympus. Where Olympus seeks risk-free value to back its treasury, $BTRFLY works on creating new value flywheels that expand the Olympus ecosystem into more volatile assets while not putting OHM value or narrative at risk.\n\nBenefits to Olympus DAO:\n- 20% of pBTRFLY supply (20 million) with a 10% supply share\n- Olympus receives majority of pBTRFLY supply-share where the team only has 9% supply share.\n- OlympusDAO will further receive a fee on all revenue post-launch, including a 5% fee on $BTRFLY and 5% fee on the revenue generated from external tokens bonded.\n- Expand Olympus community and liquidity reach to new markets such as Convex, Curve, Frax, and Tokemak\n- Proposals with communities like FRAX to use [REDACTED] to further grow their on-chain relationship with Olympus have already begun\nIncreased utility to $OHM and $gOHM token through creating new bonding applications through [REDACTED]. This includes bonding for $gOHM and making the protocols base pair $BTRFLY/$OHM\n- Funneling a diverse community of over 5000 directly into Olympus stakeholders\n- Help build and bootstrap the launch of oUSD and its relevant Curve LPs through BTRFLY bonding\n- Let Olympus focus on risk-free value while [REDACTED] branches into more strategic, volatile assets\n- Help introduce more use-cases to the Olympus ecosystem including UMA KPI options and Visor Uni V3 LPs \n- Route 20% of bribe capital (for Tokemak, Convex, and FRAX) from external protocols directly into the Olympus treasury. Other 80% goes towards people staking $BTRFLY\n- Work directly with Olympus policy team and Tetranode to utilize governance power accumulated in the protocol to bolster future Olympus ecosystem building efforts\n\nProposal:\n- Gain the support of the Olympus community to launch in good faith\n- Create a communication bridge between our two policy teams to ensure missions are aligned.\n- That's it.\n\nVoting Options:\nFor: Support [REDACTED] as a new branch of Olympus\nAgainst: Don't support [REDACTED] launch\n\n",

      "title": "OIP-45: Proteus",
      "content": "Summary: \nWe propose we rapidly bootstrap liquidity on other chains with 120k OHM (~$100m) through a cross-chain incentives program once gOHM is live next week.\n\nBackground: \nOHM liquidity currently exists on Arbitrum and Avalanche, among others, in a small form with unincentivized wsOHM LP. There has been no official stance or effort for these pools because gOHM (which will replace wsOHM) has been around the corner. Cross chain liquidity allows Olympus to reach new users, who are often excluded from Ethereum due to high gas fees.\n\nAbstract: \nAggressively bootstrap liquidity on other chains through incentivized gOHM pools. We propose a budget of 120,000 OHM over six months to ensure this effort is properly funded. This budget should serve as a maximum and not a target expenditure. It should be added that supply is projected to ~5x over the same term. Eligible chains would be: Avalanche, Fantom, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Harmony, Moonriver, Binance Smart Chain, Solana, and Terra.\n\nBenefits: \nQuickly build a large liquidity presence on other chains. We believe that we can sustain north of a quarter billion in gOHM liquidity across these chains with the budget proposed. While the DAO should retain autonomy over how much is ultimately incentivized, where, and at what rate (given it is within the bounds of this proposal), that should be a good demonstration of the power of such a program.\n\nDrawbacks: \nUnlike our efforts thus far, this bootstrapped cross chain liquidity would not be protocol owned. I can see messaging conflicts arising from that -- \"but ser, isn't pool 2 bad?\" My stance, and the stance of many in the DAO, is not that pool 2 rewards are bad, but rather that they are long term unsustainable. However, they serve as highly effective short-term bootstrapping mechanisms, which is exactly what this program would utilize them for. These pools would likely precede Olympus POL on these chains.\n\nForum post: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/381-oip-45-proteus\n\nFor: Fund Proteus with 120,000 OHM over six months.\n\nFor: Fund Proteus, different budget + timeline.\n\nAgainst: Do Not Fund Proteus.",

The accumulation of governance tokens of large DeFi protocols such as the Curve Finance ecosystem would allow us to more efficiently reach this goal. Another key objective is to strengthen the protocol over the long-term. Specifically, we are seeking to acquire strategic assets that will help generate significant non-bond revenue that can be utilized to extend the runway and add to OHM’s RFV and premium. As Olympus matures, both of these goals are becoming increasingly important.\n\n*Note: This proposal is time-sensitive. This forum post will be available for the community to comment/provide soft consensus on for 24 hours. Assuming a favorable outcome, a Snapshot vote will be posted and closed within 48 hours.*\n\n**Proposed Action: Create a CVX Bond program to acquire CVX.**\n\nAdditional context, explanation and discussion of this proposal can be found on the forum:\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/325-oip-42-launch-cvx-bonds",

      "content": "For Background - Motivation and other information concerning this proposal please see the forum post and discussion: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/278-oip-41-launch-olympus-incubator-program\n\nProposal\nApprove Olympus Incubator program for a trial period of 90 days with a budget of $3.5 million from DAO reserved OHM. The program will be overseen by a committee of 7 DAO contributors known in the community. These contributors have been involved in setting up the program they are:\n\nJaLa\nGlueeater\nTex\nWollemipine\nIndigo\nUnbanksy\nMark11\n\nAs a part of the proposal, the program committee seeks authority from the community for a separate budget of $3.5 million from DAO reserved OHM - to be dispersed using current multisig signers managing DAO funds to:\n-distribute a maximum of up to $250K in DAO reserved OHM per an incubated project as directed by the program committee from time to time, over the life of an incubation.\n\nIn addition, up to 10% of the program budget may be dispersed to:\n-DAO contributors (including committee members other than for participating in approval meetings) for work in administering the program\n-DAO contributors for work in providing advice & assistance to incubated protocols.\n\nUnused funds will be returned to the DAO OHM pool should the program not continue.\n\nAt the end of the 90 days, the program committee will provide a report concerning the program - including recommendations on further measures to include the community in the selection of projects moving forward and any other relevant improvements that could be made to the program. \n\nAfter receiving feedback from the community, the program committee will propose the parameters for an ongoing program and then proceed to a governance vote. During this process, the program committee and DAO will continue to be able to onboard projects and work with projects already onboarded - as long as it remains within the approved $3.5 million expenditure cap.\n\nThe primary considerations of the committee for approval of a project will include:\n-Prospects of success of the project including development to date\n-Value derived to OHM holders through utility or integration of OHM or other Olympus products\n-Qualifications, experience and reputation of the founders/team\n-Resources required of the DAO compared to the in-principle terms-of-agreement for the project to be included in the program\n\nSecondary considerations will include:\n-Connection to, and reputation in, the Olympus community of the founders/team\n\nThe program will provide the following:\n\nCapital\nAllow the DAO to distribute a maximum of up to $250K in OHM per an incubated project over the life of the incubation from the DAO reserved OHM.\n\nDistribution \nExposure and coverage in our social media and discord servers.\n\nGo-to-Market Expertise      \nRecruitment assistance from our Olympus community network of DeFi natives\nAdvice and assistance when required from highly skilled Olympus DAO members - with expenses covered by Olympus DAO - including community building, content creation, marketing, front-end and backend assistance, advice and review.\n\nEnd-to-End Liquidity Needs\nPriority access - with reduced or waived fees - to our upcoming launch and liquidity products.\n\nTerms \nThe incubated protocol will provide a percentage of their governance token - as negotiated by the DAO contributors and approved by the program committee.\n\nFor an example process for onboarding a project to the program (see forum proposal for this example https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/278-oip-41-launch-olympus-incubator-program)\n\nThe committee requires a community AMA and high-level disclosure of the terms of agreement with an incubated protocol - at the earliest available opportunity - taking into account the interest of the incubated protocol's success. This will often be at the initial time the incubation is approved by the program committee.\n\nProjects approved by the committee will be optimistically accepted into the program - with the caveat that at any time any member of the community may introduce an OIP to remove a protocol from the program if they believe it is in the community's best interests to do so.\n\nVote\nYes - approve Olympus Incubator\n\nNo - do not approve Olympus Incubator\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "### Proposal\n\nWe propose increasing the ETH target to 33% of Treasury RFV (from current 10%). As of today, this would mean accumulating around 50M$ of ETH in total, and this number will increase as Treasury RFV grows. We would follow the same strategy as currently implemented by OIP-28 using a 45-day moving average.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that Treasury RFV is an extremely conservative metric: At the moment, the market value of our Treasury is $670m, $11m of which are reserve ETH.\n\nFinally, considering this  increasing exposure to non-pegged assets, the Policy team is working on a proposal to shift from minting solely against RFV, by also incorporating quality (i.e. censorship-resistant, decentralized) non-pegged assets in the calculations. You can expect more on this soon.\n\n*Note: ETH mentioned in this proposal is actually wETH (wrapped ETH).*\n\nAdditional context, explanation and discussion of this proposal can be found on the forum:\n\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/262-oip-40-increase-eth-allocation-target-to-33-of-treasury-rfv\n\n### Vote\n\nFor: Increase the ETH target to 33% of Treasury Risk-Free Value\n\nAgainst: Do nothing",

      "title": "OIP-39 REDUX: Fund Tokemak tOHM Reactor with DAO Treasury OHM",
      "content": "Note: This Snapshot is being reposted with the correct amount of OHM required to seed the reactor\n\nSummary: Olympus has been awarded a Tokemak liquidity reactor as a result of the C.o.R.E voting event, which will initially provide up to $18 million in additional liquidity to OHM. Given that most OHM holders will prefer to remain staked in sOHM rather than LP in the tOHM reactor, the protocol should seed the reactor with OHM from the DAO treasury.\n\nMotivation: Following the C.o.R.E event, Olympus executed a DAO token swap with Tokemak. Tokemak will use the OHM as a reserve for tOHM. Olympus will use the TOKE to serve as a liquidity director by staking it in the tOHM reactor. This will allow Olympus to initially direct up to $18 million in liquidity (e.g., OHM-ETH), though this amount will expand quickly. The OHM in the tOHM reactor will earn TOKE rewards that, while attractive, will likely lag behind OHM staking rewards at scale. As such, most OHM holders will prefer to remain staked in sOHM. The Olympus DAO treasury holds approximately 800,000 OHM as of the time of this writing. Utilizing DAO OHM holdings to seed the reactor would require a de minimis contribution with an outsized impact: the DAO would provide incremental liquidity to OHM while earning more TOKE.\n\nProposal:\n\nUtilize ~9000 OHM from the DAO (~1.1% of the DAO OHM balance) to seed the tOHM reactor\nMonitor reactor capacity and add OHM from the DAO as appropriate",

      "title": "OIP-38: Formalizing Bug Bounty Partnership with Immunefi",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal will list the two tiers of the Olympus Bug Bounty (as described in OIP-17 and OIP-34) on ImmuneFi, and authorize Immunefi to vet Proof of Concept submissions to be in turn forwarded to the Bug Bounty Management Team. This will also include paying ImmuneFi a 10% fee on each bounty claimed through their platform.\n\nMotivation\n\nWho is Immunefi: Immunefi is a community of white hat developers who actively look for bugs and exploits in return for preapproved bounties. They provide a secure and private system for bug identification and submission as well as services in vetting and quantifying submitted bugs and suggested fixes, and are trusted by protocols such as The Graph, Tokemak, Sushiswap, and Arbitrum.\n\nHow they Can Help: In OIP-17 the Bug Bounty program was handed over to Strategos for implementation, however OIP-17 lacked specifics on who should implement it, how they should do so, and how they would be compensated for doing so. Accordingly, while the Bug Bounty does officially exist, there has been no serious coordinated effort to market it and it remains largely unknown to the white hat community. A recent project proposal was passed placing Proof of Steve and Zayen X in charge of the program to expedite submissions and marketing efforts. However, both Proof of Steve and Zayen X believe that in addition to fielding direct submission from Ohmies, working with Immunefi will be advantageous for the program in that it will put the Olympus Bug Bounty in front of  hundreds of experienced white hats and provide it with much needed publicity, and a ready-to-go SOP for bug/vulnerability intake.\n\nProposal\n\nAuthorize Proof of Steve to post the Olympus Bug Bounties on Immunefi.com.\n\nAdopt the Immunefi → Management Team bug submission intake process disclosed within the previously approved project proposal placing Proof of Steve and Zayen X in charge of the Bug Bounty program.\n(Intake Process SOP:\n\n1. A whitehat submits a vulnerability/exploit and suggested fix to Immunefi, formatted as a PoC.\n\n2. Immunefi vets the PoC.\n\n3. Immunefi approves/denies the PoC.\n\n4. If the PoC is approved, Immunefi submits the PoC to the Management team.\n\n5. Management approves/denies the PoC.\n\n6. If approved, Management mints the NFT, rewards the white hat the bounty and NFT, and pays Immunefi.\n\n7. Management creates the fix bounty.\n\n8. Fix hired out to whitelisted OHM dev or trusted third party.\n\n9. Fix submitted to management for vetting.\n\n10. If fix approved, fix is implemented by dev from 8/Zayen X, and the fix bounty is paid (fix bounties paid after fix is implemented).\n\n11. Awarding of bounties and NFTs is announced through formal channels.)\n\nImmuneFi charges a 10% fee for any bounty awarded through its platform in return for its organizational and PoC vetting services (for example if a bounty of $100 was claimed through ImmuneFi, they would charge an additional $10 fee). This proposal will greenlight the additional payout of that fee to ImmuneFi for any bounties claimed through them.\n\nVoting Period:\n\nThe Snapshot voting begins now and ends at noon UTC on 27/10/2021.\n\nPoll\n\nFor: If the proposal is approved Proof of Steve is authorized to post the Olympus Bug Bounties on Immunefi, the intake processes disclosed in the ‘proposal’ section will become the official ImmuneFi PoC intake SOPs for the Bug Bounty proposal, and additional payments to ImmuneFi per their 10% fee policy will be greenlit.\n\nAgainst: If this proposal is rejected none of the above actions will be taken and no changes will be made.",

      "title": "TAP-5: Whitelist Liquity LUSD Stability Pool and LQTY Staking",
      "content": "Summary:\nWhitelist Liquity LUSD Stability Pool and LQTY staking for Olympus treasury deposits.\n\nBackground:\nOIP-20 defined a framework for Olympus where 33% of excess treasury reserves can be deposited to earn yield in whitelisted protocols. At the time of this writing, the whitelisted protocols are Aave, Compound, Convex, and Sushiswap(Onsen). This proposal seeks to add Liquity to this whitelist while keeping the same 33% treasury deposit cap.\n\nDescription from liquity.org:\nLiquity is a decentralized borrowing protocol that allows you to draw 0% interest loans against Ether used as collateral. Loans are paid out in LUSD - a USD pegged stablecoin, and need to maintain a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%.\nIn addition to the collateral, the loans are secured by a Stability Pool containing LUSD and by fellow borrowers collectively acting as guarantors of last resort.\nLiquity as a protocol is non-custodial, immutable and governance-free.\n\nSpecifics:\nThis proposal is only targeting the LUSD stability pool and LQTY staking on Liquity. LUSD would be deposited in the stability pool to earn LQTY. The earned LQTY would be staked to earn more LUSD and ETH. Liquidations in the platform use the stability pool’s LUSD to ensure the protocol is healthy. In doing so, ETH is provided and LUSD is taken. This is considered acceptable as the treasury already accumulates ETH and LUSD bonds can replenish any LUSD removed from our deposit.\n\nRisks:\nA vulnerability in the Liquity protocol could lead to partial or complete loss of funds. Severe liquidations could leave us with substantially less LUSD, but more ETH.\n\nProtocol Analysis:\nUsing a risk analysis framework developed by the DAO, the Policy and Partnerships teams have attempted to score various protocols based on some subjective and non-subjective data. Liquity scored well in this regard. The subjective values were derived from averaging the votes of multiple DAO members.\n\nMotivation:\nWhitelisting Liquity will allow Olympus to begin accumulating LQTY which can then be staked for more LUSD and ETH. This also increases our chances for further Liquity partnerships in the future. Lastly, our funds in the stability pool would help ensure the long term success of the Liquity protocol.",

      "content": "Summary: Olympus has been awarded a Tokemak liquidity reactor as a result of the C.o.R.E voting event, which will initially provide up to $18 million in additional liquidity to OHM. Given that most OHM holders will prefer to remain staked in sOHM rather than LP in the tOHM reactor, the protocol should seed the reactor with OHM from the DAO treasury.\n\nMotivation: Following the C.o.R.E event, Olympus executed a DAO token swap with Tokemak. Tokemak will use the OHM as a reserve for tOHM. Olympus will use the TOKE to serve as a liquidity director by staking it in the tOHM reactor. This will allow Olympus to initially direct up to $18 million in liquidity (e.g., OHM-ETH), though this amount will expand quickly. The OHM in the tOHM reactor will earn TOKE rewards that, while attractive, will likely lag behind OHM staking rewards at scale. As such, most OHM holders will prefer to remain staked in sOHM. The Olympus DAO treasury holds approximately 715,000 OHM as of the time of this writing. Utilizing DAO OHM holdings to seed the reactor would require a de minimis contribution with an outsized impact: the DAO would provide incremental liquidity to OHM while earning more TOKE.\n\nProposal:\n\nUtilize ~900 OHM from the DAO (~0.10% of the DAO OHM balance) to seed the tOHM reactor\nMonitor reactor capacity and add OHM from the DAO as appropriate",

To prevent large dumps at the end of each term, have a daily/epoch limit on number of stakers admitted to the contract (10, 20, etc.) or amount of OHM per day and a reservation system. I think this would encourage more staking/retention. Early Unstaking would forego these rewards and redistribute to those still standing or returned to the DAO.\n\n2 - Another option would be having a time-locked rewards pool of NFTs, donated by the community, an artist trying to make a name and/or purchased by the DAO. I think with the current NFT craze this would bring Olympus to the attention of a large amount of potential members.\n\n3 - A mix of 1 and 2.",

Given current market conditions, and looking to the future of OHM as a trading pair, the Policy team believes that it’s the perfect time to launch an OHM-ETH liquidity pool and bond, which will allow us to capture additional volume and fees.\n\n### Proposal\n\n- Match $2.5M worth of DAO OHM with $2.5M worth of Treasury ETH ($5m total liquidity) for the initial LP position to bootstrap the pool. At current prices we have $7,255,000 of ETH in the Treasury. This wouldn't affect treasury RFV in any way. The alternative to this would be paying out OHM incentives to liquidity providers to launch the pool, which would just increase the cost to the protocol.\n\n- Launch an OHM-ETH bond\n\n- Target an initial $100m in liquidity accumulated over a minimum of 4 weeks. Depending on market conditions the Policy team would speed up or slow down this process, but the target would not be reached before 4 weeks.\n\n- After that, maintain 20% of our total liquidity in the OHM-ETH pool\n\n- The ETH portion of this pool would be in addition to the targets for ETH as a reserve asset in treasury, which has a separate allocation target, outlined by OIP-15 (and its amendments)\n\nAdditional context, explanation and discussion of this proposal can be found on the forum:\n\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/193-oip-37-launch-ohm-eth-liquidity-bonds\n\n### Vote\nOption (1): Bootstrap OHM-ETH pool as proposed and launch OHM-ETH bond\nOption (2): Don't bootstrap OHM-ETH pool, but launch OHM-ETH bond. In this case we'd have to pay OHM incentives to LPs to launch the pool.\nOption (3): Do nothing",

      "title": "OIP-34: Adding language to Tier 1 of Bug Bounty",
      "content": "Summary\n\nThis proposal is designed to add a second category of bugs to Tier 1 of the Bug Bounty program outlined in OIP-17. This new tier will cover “bugs/exploits which could lead to a loss of user funds” and will provide a flat fee reward of $333k per vulnerability/exploit.\n\nMotivation\n\nIn the aftermath of the Jay-Pegs/Miso incident, 865 ETH (around $2.5m if you price them at an average of $3k per ETH) were stolen from Miso users through a UI exploit which replaced the proper wallet address for the sale with a scammer’s address.\n\nFunds were recovered thanks to diligent work by the Sushi team (and allegedly a threatening shipment of Chinese food). However, when reading about this it occurred to me that this vulnerability would not have been covered under any of OIP-17’s current tiers, and thus not available for a bounty.\n\nThe point of a Bug Bounty is to incentivize developers to report vulnerabilities and exploits to be fixed, instead of taking advantage of them. Taking advantage of vulnerabilities is a risky proposition, if someone finds out who you are you could face legal or extrajudicial consequences. Providing someone with a way to make money off of doing the right thing instead does not only give them a monetary incentive to help improve the security of Olympus, it also lets them avoid the stress of having to look over their shoulder worrying about when the hammer might come down. This game theory principle applies to exploits that would allow a hacker to drain user funds just as much as it does one that would allow them to drain treasury funds.\n\nAccordingly, I believe it is in Olympus’ best interest to add the additional “bug type” to Tier 1 of the Bug Bounty program created through OIP-17.\n\nProposal\n\nChange the text of Tier 1 of the Bug Bounty program to read, “Tier 1: For bugs/exploits which would lead to a loss of bond funds or a loss of user funds, a flat reward of $333,333.”\nWhen management and chain of command is set for managing the Bug Bounty program and allocating rewards for submitted bugs (a plan for this this will be detailed in a separate project proposal currently in the works by Zayen X and Proof of Steve, but in the event that project proposal does not pass the program will remain in the hands of Strategos in general), this updated text will be included in their disclosures for bug hunters and will be used as the base rule for examining submitted bugs.\n\nPolling Period\n\nThe polling process begins now and will end at 10:00 UTC on 13/10/2021. After this, a Scattershot vote will be put up at 10:00 UTC on 15/10/2021.\n\nPoll\n\nFor: The text of Tier 1 of the Bug Bounty program, in all official disclosures, will be changed to read “Tier 1: For bugs/exploits which would lead to a loss of bond funds or a loss of user funds, a flat reward of $333,333.”\n\nAgainst: The text of Tier 1 of the Bug Bounty program will not be changed.",

      "content": "**Summary:**\n\nWhitelist Compound for Olympus treasury deposits.\n\n**Background:**\n\nOIP-20 defined a framework for Olympus where 33% of excess treasury reserves can be deposited to earn yield in whitelisted protocols. At the time of this writing, the three whitelisted protocols are Aave, Convex, and Sushiswap(Onsen). This proposal seeks to add Compound to this whitelist while keeping the same 33% treasury deposit cap. As this is a whitelist proposal, a risk analysis was performed and can be found below.\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nCompound launched in late 2018 and has long had over 10 billion in TVL. The protocol is known for having a conservative approach to adding new assets as well as tweaking lending parameters which are both done via governance. By whitelisting Compound, Olympus would have a lower risk option for putting treasury assets to work.\n\n**Risks:**\n\nA vulnerability in the Compound protocol could lead to partial or complete loss of funds.\n\n**Protocol Analysis:**\n\nUsing a risk analysis framework developed by the DAO, the Policy and Partnerships teams have attempted to score various protocols based on some subjective and non-subjective data. Compound scored very highly in this regard. The large TVL and track record of the protocol were also considered.\n\n**Motivation:**\n\nWhitelisting Compound will allow for Olympus to lend treasury funds in a battle-tested DeFi protocol to earn additional assets as well as the COMP governance token. This also increases our chances for a possible partnership in the future.\n\nFull forum post here: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/128-tap-4-whitelist-compound-finance",

      "content": "**Summary:** Execute a token swap of OHM and TOKE with Tokemak to activate an OHM reactor leading into their C.O.R.E event, which will run for one week- starting 28th September. This proposal will only go into effect if Olympus is among the Top-5 protocols that receive the most votes at the end of the event. This OHM reactor and swap will help establish ties between both protocols and allow both parties to explore more ways of combining our unique infrastructures, diversify treasuries, and provide governance power within each other’s protocols.\n\n**Background:** Olympus has over 170M USD in POL as of writing, with over 150M million USD in the OHM-DAI pool alone. The protocol currently owns ~ 99.9% of this liquidity and therefore routes that liquidity. Our policy team predominately handles this process by executing these internal decisions voted upon by our community per the Policy Framework, as outlined in OIP-22.\n\nTokemak currently has ~ 400M USD in TVL across their Genesis pools, with their PCA reserve also holding a combined 30M USD in both ETH and USDC. Each reactor serves as an isolated pair of assets with the option for single-sided liquidity provision on both sides of the pair. When providing liquidity on either side of a reactor, protocols, and users will receive weekly TOKE emissions. In the event of IL, Tokemak would draw liquidity from its PCA reserve to rebalance the specific reactor that has suffered the loss to make LPs whole again.\n\n**Abstract:** Olympus has pioneered the concept of POL via Bonds, and Tokemak is attempting to solve for market-making within Defi through its novel liquidity routing infrastructure. Olympus views Tokemak as an essential infrastructure piece to; democratize liquidity provision, strengthen OHM liquidity pairs across different exchanges, accumulate TOKE to supplement OHM bond emissions. This swap allows Tokemak to use the OHM as an operational reserve to spin up an OHM reactor, and in return, Olympus will receive a USD equivalent worth of TOKE to become a powerful liquidity director. The 3M USD of OHM as a reserve would be paired with 3M USD of ETH in order to source an initial 18M USD worth of liquidity (9M USD of OHM + equivalent 9M USD of ETH) for the OHM reactor. The OHM used for the swap will come out of the DAO holdings (1.3% of our total OHM holdings).\n\n**Motivation: **Establish a bond between both protocols in order to explore more ways Olympus and Tokemak can better leverage their unique infrastructures.\n\n**Intended Utilisation:** Olympus will use the TOKE from the swap to direct OHM liquidity in the tOHM reactor. The additional TOKE earned whilst directing liquidity in the OHM reactor will function as a policy, treasury, and partnerships lever to potentially reduce bond emissions and reduce slippage across OHM pairs.",

Initially, we would like to deposit $100K Dai in Gro Protocol’s risk tranched PWRD vault (secured 270% by their leveraged vault product)\n\n**Motivation:** PWRD is low-risk savings product. Designed to offer safer access to DeFi yields, tokenised as a stablecoin with built-in yield and protection. Its value is backed by three of the most traded stablecoins on the market—DAI, USDC, and USDT—but also protected against problems with any of them.\n\nAs Gro Risk Balancer spreads risk across stablecoins, this helps to protect PWRD if one of DAI, USDC, or USDT fails or gets censored. It then offers Deposit Protection, as the risk tranching mechanism means that any loss of capital from stablecoins or yield strategies is first absorbed by the Vault, letting PWRD generate yield more safely.\n\nhttps://docs.gro.xyz/gro-docs/gro-products/pwrd\n\nMoreover, Gro presents a forward-thinking look at product design and enabling the next wave of new defi users. They’ve already secured partnerships with Argent and continue to attract new capital for their products.\n\nWe look forward to expanding this relationship following a pilot deposit.  Based on community feedback this proposal has been adjusted.\n\n**Risks:** Gro is a younger protocol following a guarded launch mode (~$10M TVL). This protocol carries similar composability risks as other yield aggregators but using the PWRD product protects us from various risks including yield platform failures and stable coin peg failures.\n\nhttps://docs.gro.xyz/gro-docs/gro-products/pwrd/deposit-protection\n\nOur Dai would remain Dai in this engagement.",

      "title": "OIP-25: Expand beyond Layer 1 Ethereum by deploying Olympus contracts and a pool to Arbitrum.",
      "content": "Summary: \nExpand beyond Layer 1 Ethereum by deploying Olympus contracts and a pool to Arbitrum.\n\nBackground: \nArbitrum is the first Ethereum Layer 2 to go live. It offers far lower fees than Layer 1 while featuring the same security. Olympus is currently only available on Layer 1, and gas fees have become extremely prohibitive in recent weeks with NFT mania, EIP-1559 and a rising ETH price.\n\nAbstract: \nDeployment on Arbitrum would look like the following:\n\nWe utilize the 550 WETH (market value ~$1.7m) and equal value OHM to create a $3.4m OHM-WETH liquidity pool on Sushiswap Arbitrum.\nWe create a single bond type, which offers OHM in exchange for OHM-WETH liquidity.\nWe create a new Arbitrum staking contract, which receives rewards based on bond sales.\nTo expand on point 1:\n\nUsing the WETH in the treasury currently allows us to bootstrap a decent-sized initial pool without affecting treasury RFV.\nThis would reset the clock on WETH accumulation as laid out in OIP-15.\nTo expand on point 2:\n\nBond sales, and staking rewards, would be pre-funded from Layer 1. The Arbitrum treasury would hold an inventory of OHM, which it can use for these two purposes. OHM would not be minted on Layer 2.\nTo expand on point 3:\n\nArbitrum would have its own staking contract. The yield on Arbitrum sOHM would differ from yields on Ethereum sOHM.\nRewards on arbitrum would be a set multiple of bond sales. For example, lets say the policy-governed Staking Multiple is 2x, and someone executes a bond which will payout 10 OHM. 20 OHM (10 * 2x) would go to staking, to be included in the next epoch's rebase.\nThis will create a variable rate staking yield, unlike Layer 1's fixed rate yield (rebases on Ethereum are consistent regardless of bond subscription).\nThis will create a stronger alignment of incentives between stakers and the treasury, since stakers receive more rewards when more bonds are executed.\nPlease note that variable rate is experimental, and policy may discontinue it in favor of fixed rate (like we have now) at any time. Its' success creates a lot of opportunities as we expand to more chains, but we need to first observe whether theory matches reality.\nThis might sound complicated. As an end user, here's what you need to know:\n\nUI/UX would be the same as on Layer 1.\nA single bond type would be available -- OHM-WETH.\nStaking would work the same, but rebases would be more variable. They will likely be higher than Layer 1 staking at some times, and lower at other times. An important consideration for participants is the 1 week withdrawal time from Arbitrum back to Ethereum; this makes it impossible to quickly bounce back and forth to the highest yield.\nWe propose approving 100k OHM in funding to be used as bond payouts and staking rewards. This will be split into two 50k chunks, with a policy reevaluation in the middle. Given the entire amount is utilized, the liquidity pool should grow to to $15m-20m, and enough rewards should be provided to incentivize 100k-200k OHM. This OHM funding would be deployed over a minimum term of 1 month. (For reference, supply on Ethereum is projected to grow by ~700k OHM over the same term.) When this 100k OHM funding runs out, we will reassess the continuation of bonds on Arbitrum, and the continuation of variable rate staking.\n\nContracts are prepared and ready to deploy if/as soon as governance believes we should execute.\n\nMotivation: \nExpand availability and presence of Olympus beyond Ethereum Layer 1. Experiment with a variable rate staking option. Become a dominant player on Arbitrum, especially with reference to liquidity -- we want to make OHM one of, if not the, most liquid assets on Arbitrum.\n\nFor: Deploy to Arbitrum\n\nFor: Deploy to Arbitrum, but without variable rate staking\n\nAgainst: Do not deploy to Arbitrum\n\nForum Post: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/102-oip-25-deploy-olympus-to-arbitrum",

      "content": "Summary\n\nThe DAO has been working on many new functionalities since our last audit, two of which are especially important to the security of the protocol. These two would be in scope for the audit:\n\n1. WSOHM => We have already seen some protocols adopt the WSOHM contract but to get this integrated into other partner protocols they have requested an audit of this contract\n\n2. Olympus Pro => A new product of Olympus which would need audits to the contracts as well.\n\nMotivation\n\nWhile an audit does not prevent any exploits, it can build trust both internally for our dev team as well as externally to potential partnership protocols. Because we believe that there is a huge difference in audit firms, we have opted for an industry acknowledged top tier auditing firm in Runtime Verification for which we would also like to enter a longer-term partnership.\n\nDue to an unforeseen opening in their calendar, this audit can start already at the end of September as opposed to December/January which is why we want to take this unique opportunity to get both contracts audited as soon as possible. Because we are working with a (very) tight deadline, we will go to voting sooner than usual and will start the snapshot vote already after 24 hours.\n\nThey estimated the cost of the audit at a maximum of 200K of which 40% could be paid in OHM and the other 60% in stables.\n\nProposal\n\nAllocate up to $200K of the DAO funds for the audit of both the WSOHM as well as the Olympus Pro contracts.\n\nVote\n\n1. For the proposed audit\n2. Against the audit\n\nForum post: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/94-oip-23-audit-for-critical-contracts/33",

      "title": "OIP-21: DAO Budget Increase + Milestone Framework",
      "content": "Summary:\n\nNote: Current DAO budget, as approved by OIP-12, is 30k DAI/Week (in OHM equiv.).\n\nThis is a two-part actionable proposal:\n\n    Part 1 is to authorize an additional 30k DAI/Week (60K/week total; in OHM equivalent) to support the work done by all DAO members. Please note, this budget comes from the DAO treasury ($90 million at time of writing), not the protocol treasury.\n\n    Part 2 is to set and authorize a [framework] for two additional budget raises to 75K and 90k per week, respectively. These additional budget raises will be authorized based on key milestones (outlined below).\n\nAbstract:\n\nSince OIP-12, the DAO has grown from 23 to 61 active contributors (a 265% growth!). In that time and budget, the DAO delivered on multiple high-impact initiatives such as website revamp, community server onboarding revamp & Sherpa program, FOHMO 2, community education projects and strategic partnerships (Rari Fuse, Frax, AAVE, Convex, Abracadabra).\n\nThe DAO continues to operate effectively across Engineering, Marketing, Community, Partnerships, Operations and Policy teams with the current $30K/week budget. However, the latest allocation stretches some teams thin. In a recent allocation survey, 36% reported feeling underpaid. We see increased competition in the marketplace for the level of contribution we have in the DAO and we would like to retain and build on that talent. We have amazing people, we would like to pay them well, and we’d like to attract and retain the same level of talent to build together the future of Olympus.\n\nProposal:\n\nNote: Allocations will continue as they have been with Strategos allocating to their department teams (marketing, partnerships, operations, policy, content, design, engineering), and project leaders allocating to their respective project teams.\n\nPart 1 proposes an amendment to the current DAO budget, authorizing an additional 30k DAI/week (60K per week total) to be available for distribution to DAO contributors.\n\nIf passed, Part 1 will result in a total of approximately 255-265k DAI/month (in OHM equivalent) available for allocation to DAO contributors. For some comparison, $250k is equivalent to ~1.8% of RFV inflow for July, ~0.7% of DAO treasury increase for July, or ~1.5 hours of staking rewards.\n\nPart 2 of this proposal sets a framework of milestones, which if reached, will authorize two additional budget raises to 75K and 90K/weekly, respectively.\n\nWe are proposing this [framework] for the budget because it allows a long term vision as opposed to a short term mindset; we wish to link the DAO budget to tangible milestones as set forth in this proposal.\n\nWe propose that we must accomplish at least three out of four milestones to increase the budget.\n\nMilestones for $75k:\n-15k Ohmies staking (excluding dust under 0.01 sOHM)\n-17.5k Ohmies in Discord\n-close 5 strategic protocol partnerships\n-Launch 4 new integrations of OHM/sOHM/wsOHM\n\nMilestones for 90K:\n-17.5k Ohmies staking (excluding dust under 0.01 sOHM)\n-20k Ohmies in Discord\n-close 10 strategic protocol partnerships\n-Launch 7 new integrations of OHM/sOHM/wsOHM\n\nAs a DAO we strive to be prudent in our spending. In an efficient organization there may occasionally be a surplus in budget, this will be rolled into the next allocation cycle.\n\nTransparency is key. It is to be noted in this proposal; the DAO will be sharing DAO budget and allocation data on an ongoing basis each month (after monthly allocations). We will begin by sharing the current operating model, along with all allocations, up until this point in time. Here is the link to that data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp0MOaD-rMXC9jWhhxCn6NmCfFpF2jlhWM-QQZ-CBUk/edit?usp=sharing\n\nWhen we release the allocations for august, the sheets will also be updated with numerous charts to improve the readability of the data.\n\nInvitation:\n\nAny and all community members are invited to collaborate in the DAO whether it be in current projects or to propose their own project to be allocated to.\n\nOriginal Forum Post: https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/88-oip-21-dao-budget-increase-milestone-framework\n\nVote:\nOption 1: For budget raise and framework implementation\nOption 2: Against budget raise and framework implementation",

      "content": "Summary\n\nThe assets in OlympusDAO's treasury can be utilized to gain passive yield income for all Ohmies. The objective of treasury management is to balance this productive income, with a very conservative risk tolerance policy. In order to move together to achieve an optimal use of our assets, we must lay out a sustainable asset framework.\n\nThis framework should enable the protocol to manage our treasury assets with agility, without the need to go through a (lengthy) governance cycle. The proposal laid out below is to give the DAO the mandate to allocate up to 33% of excess reserves into whitelisted protocols approved by the community (currently Aave, Convex, and Sushiswap). Excess reserves are treasury assets which are not used to back OHM currently in circulation.\n\nMotivation\n\nAt the time of writing, the treasury holds 92.5m USD worth of tokens in MV. Of this 92 million, only 4.5m or <5% is currently deployed in whitelisted protocols of which:\n\n 4.2m of OHM/DAI LP on Sushi Onsen \n 1m of DAI on Aave \n 333K of FRAX on Convex \n\nThis only represents 5% of our entire treasury, leaving a lot money on the table. For example, our Onsen LP already netted us around 670K USD in xSUSHI.\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce a framework which would allow the DAO to allocate up to 33% of excess treasury reserves in whitelisted protocols. By proposing a % as opposed to a fixed sum, it will allow the DAO to reduce overhead and numerous votes while still maintaining a conservative approach with regards to our treasury management. This in essence makes the DAO more efficient.\n\nOne last important note is that these treasury assets can only be used in whitelisted protocols which have been voted on by the DAO. This currently only includes Aave, Convex and Sushiswap but can be extended in the future.\n\nProposal\n\nThis proposal aims to introduce a framework which would allow the DAO to allocate up to 33% of excess treasury reserves in whitelisted protocols.\n\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/87-oip-20-framework-for-excess-reserve-allocation\n\nVote\n\nOption 1: For the proposed framework (max 33% of excess reserves)\nOption 2: Against the proposed framework",

We believe an important way to do so is via strategic partnerships with crucial infrastructural protocols in the industry. We would like clarity on our ability to pursue swaps with aforementioned protocols, and strategic entities, as a way to bolster our utility as the reserve currency of the Decentralized Finance industry.\n\nAbstract: We propose a clear mandate allowing the DAO to pursue strategic swaps. Swaps may occur at par, a discount, or a premium, depending on additional factors involved with each deal. Strategies may include commitments to bond the partners’ token, especially within OHM-X pools.\n\nAll decisions would be voted upon prior to finalization. Approval here allows DAO members to initiate conversations with other DAOs and entities and structure terms that should be agreeable both to the counterparty and the Olympus community. In other words, this provides permission to speak on behalf of the DAO during the legwork of these proposals.\n\nPotential partners include (but are not limited to): Sushiswap, Maker, Aave, Frax, Rari, Tokemak, and Yearn.\n\nMotivation: Increase OHMs use and utility as a liquid reserve asset, and bolster Olympus’s influence within the DeFi industry.\n\nConcerns: DAO-owned OHM would be introduced into the market. However, it would remain in the possession of those who are highly likely to remain long-term aligned with us.\n\nVote:\nFor: Approve DAO to pursue strategic swaps\nAgainst: Do not approve DAO to pursue strategic swaps.",

      "content": "Summary: Create a two tier bug-bounty and reward system, including a \"Proof of Whitehat\" NFT reward and a cash bonus. Fund the cash bonus at least partly through the use of treasury yield strategies, with remaining funds as needed coming from DAO funds.\n\nMotivation: OHM needs to be secure and safe, and the best way to do that is to incentivize white hats to regularly search for bugs and potential exploits by offering them cold hard cash when they find one. We are a community based around cooperation. For 3,3 to be a lasting state of affairs, and to keep the mutual trust that requires, every ohmie must know that they are staking their money in a safe and regularly stress tested protocol.\n\nProposal:\n\nThe Tiers and Bounties:\n\nTier 1: For bugs/exploits which would lead to a loss of bond funds, a flat reward of $333,333.\nTier 2: For bugs/exploits which would lead to a loss of treasury funds, a flat reward of $3,333,333.\nThe \"Proof of Whitehat\" NFTs:\nOHM will commission an NFT design to be minted on an as needed basis which will serve as proof that the address they are awarded to successfully identified either a tier-1 or tier-2 bug/exploit. These NFTs will recognize that address as a \"Hero of Olympus\" who is competent enough to serve as a white hat and can be trusted to act in good faith when properly incentivized. In essence these NFTs will serve as a letter of recommendation from all of Olympus DAO to the White Hats who help us identify and prevent bugs/exploits.\n\nSource of Funds for Bug Bounty:\nIf approved this proposal will allocate 10% of treasury yield strategies to a ‘Bug Bounty Fund', set aside specifically to reward Heroes of Olympus (white hats) for their work helping keep OHM safe and secure. In the event additional funds are needed outside of what the Bug Bounty Fund can provide, funds will be allocated as needed out of general DAO funds.\n\nAdditional Details:\nAny details which are not explicitly outlined in this post, but which must be decided upon in order to execute the Bug Bounty program (including but not limited to; what token/tokens the bounty is paid in, who is commissioned to create the NFT, etc.) shall be decided by Strategos.\n\nPoll:\nIf Ohmies vote to \"Implement BBP\" the Bug Bounty Program will be implemented as written, by Strategos.\nIf Ohmies vote \"Do Not Implement BBP\" the Bug Bounty Program will not be implemented.",

      "title": "OIP-14 - Deploy 333,333 excess treasury FRAX to Convex Finance",
      "content": "Summary:\nPropose that Olympus trial to deploy 333,333 (this amount has been edited up from 100,000) excess FRAX from the treasury to the FRAX pool in Convex Finance in order to accumulate trading fees, CRV tokens and CVX tokens.\n\nBackground:\nThe purpose of this proposal is to improve treasury capital efficiency, where our stablecoin assets are earning trading fees, CVX tokens and CRV tokens. Convex is a protocol that is allows for automated management of CRV pool assets. Convex does not charge deposit or withdrawal fees - it takes 16% of the CRV rewards which are distributed to Convex stakeholders. Convex currently has $3.8 in TVL. I consider Curve deposit directly is not appropriate because in order for smart contract wallets to receive CRV rewards directly from Curve those wallets have to be whitelisted by a Curve governance vote. Such votes have not been well received by Curve governance where solutions like Convex exist. (For a background of why we would not deposit directly to Curve and pursue our own gauges please see this thread which presented an immovable roadblock to the FRAX protocol from pursuing just that strategy). This proposal has been discussed on #Goverance in the discord, in the General section of the forum and by a largely positive vote on the Proposal section of the forum. The original number of FRAX was changed to 333,333 FRAX following discussion and feedback.\n\nAbstract:\nOlympus has about 3.6 million FRAX sitting idle in the treasury when it could be earning interest. Currently the Convex FRAX pool is paying 0.41% apr in trading fees, 7.82% apr in CRV tokens and 5.91% apr in CVX tokens - this is a substantial amount of value not currently being captured by Olympus (these percentages already account for Convex fees). This proposal seeks to trial a deposit of 333,333 excess treasury FRAX into the Convex FRAX pool in order to capture some of this value for Olympus. The sum of 333,333 represents about ~6% of our current FRAX holdings. I propose that the treasury retain the CRV and CVX token rewards and redeposit them into Convex for further yield. In that circumstance it is reasonable and appropriate for us to pursue a low risk trial strategy to collect interest available to us through our FRAX holdings. The amount can be raised above 333,333 by a further OIP when and if the community is comfortable in taking on more risk in the future.\n\nRisks:\nThe author considers the passing of the proposal adds the following risks to the amount of FRAX deposited. Curve oracle and smart contract risk, indirect exposure risk to USDC, DAI and Tether through 3pool via FRAX-3pool, Convex smart contract risk (Convex is carrying 3.8 billion dollars https://defipulse.com/convex-finance - the author considers it to essentially be a farming contract). Given FRAX itself has deposited 72 million FRAX into Convex through an AMO, we are to some extent already exposed to a failure in this risk stack of Frax, Convex and Curve (at least to the extent of FRAX's 16.5% backing by FXS governance tokens).\n\nMotivation:\nThis would allow us collect CRV tokens, CVX tokens and trading fees on a portion of our FRAX holdings.\n\nVoting period: voting period will be for 5 days from the date of scattershot voting commencement.\n\nFor:\nDeploy 333,333 FRAX to the Convex FRAX pool.\n\nAgainst:\nDo not deploy FRAX to the Convex FRAX pool at this time.",

This is our reduction period.\n-Change reward rate calculation from circulating supply to total supply\n-Target a reward rate of 0.35% of total supply by the end of the reduction period, current reward rate is 0.44% of total supply.\n-The 0.35% reward rate translates to a rebase of ~ 0.50%, and an APY of 20k+\n-Increase runway by ~ 6 weeks due to this reduction.\n-Have a total runway of almost 200 days after the reduction period.\n-Bonding becomes more attractive, driving revenue growth due to a lower required rate of return.\n\nAdditional context, explanation and discussion of this proposal can be found on the forum:\nhttps://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/37-oip-11-reducing-reward-rate\n\nFor: Reduce reward rate to 0.35% of total supply gradually over a period of 3 weeks.\nAgainst: Do nothing\n\nIf the proposal passes the changes would come into effect immediately.",

      "content": "Summary:\nLet's expand our community, liquidity, and treasury through a partnership with FRAX.\n\nBackground:\nRight now we have only one pool, OHM-DAI on Sushiswap. Our treasury now owns over 89% of that pool. Liquidity building was and is a productive activity that thickens our order books while growing our treasury. This liquidity building was most potent when we owned only a portion of the pool.\n\nAbstract:\nThis proposal suggests we partner with FRAX to build an OHM-FRAX pool on Uniswap. This would introduce us to a new trading market, while simultaneously adding our first new treasury asset. The pool would be bootstrapped via dual-incentived LP-staking hosted by FRAX. The pool would be accumulated by our treasury through OHM-FRAX liquidity bonds.\n\nOnce enough liquidity has built up in the OHM-FRAX pool, we want to extend this partnership through AMOs. For those unfamiliar with FRAX AMOs, they are similar to our bonds. In this case, our treasury would mint OHM using FRAX as backing (FRAX bonds) while the FRAX treasury would mint FRAX using OHM as backing (OHM AMO). This allows Olympus and FRAX to expand treasuries and supply together.\n\nMotivation:\nTo thicken our liquidity, grow our treasury, and expand our community through a fitting and mutually beneficial partnership with FRAX.\n\nFor: We should do the partnership\nAgainst: We should not do the partnership",

We are currently unable to add new reserve/liquidity assets or deploy reserves, and staking rewards are preminted, creating a high total supply and FDV that freaks people out. For our V2, we also need to enable new functionality that is not currently possible.\n\nAbstract: Implement a whole new suite of contracts. We would replace everything except for the OHM token. This new deployment can be done in parallel to existing contracts; we construct the entire new ecosystem, and kick it off by simply pointing the OHM token toward the new vault.\n\nMotivation: Operate with improved contracts, enable new functionality, and set ourselves up for V2 and beyond.\n\nTimeline: We are in the midst of an audit on these contracts, and hope we can deploy them as soon as Monday, May 17th.\n\nAdditional Info: https://olympusdao.medium.com/olympus-v1-1-a5c6a48be7d1\n\nFor: Roll out V1.1 contracts\nAgainst: Keep V1 contracts",

      "content": "Summary: Implement a new staking system as part of V1.1 which enables Hades and prevents reward manipulation through a stake-claim system.\n\nBackground: Rebase manipulation has been a common topic since we launched. There have been many cases of users, especially LPs, staking to gain a rebase and unstaking right after. This is unfair to stakers and is not aligned with (3, 3), and in my opinion should be prevented.\nWe also have Hades already integrated into bonds. Privacy is extremely valuable, and it seems like a positive to integrate that solution everywhere that we can. The more prevalent and common Hades is, the more effective it becomes.\n\nAbstract: This new staking contract would operate on a stake-claim model. The basic steps are as follows:\n\n1) Stake: OHM is sent to the staking contract, and you are told when it can be reclaimed (after the next rebase occurs). At this point, you can also provide a new address as the recipient.\n2) Claim: A rebase occurs, and now you can come back and take your sOHM. From here on everything is the same.\n2.1) Forfeit: If the rebase hasn't occurred yet but you want your OHM back, you can always forfeit the claim.\n\nMotivation: Increase the utility of staking through Hades, and ensure fairness of reward distribution.\n\nDrawbacks: The claim transaction adds a point of friction when staking in.\n\nFor: Implement this new system.\nAgainst: Keep the current system.",

      "content": "Summary: We should decrease LP staking rewards now that the protocol owns the vast majority of the pool.\n\nBackground: LP staking was introduced at launch to help bootstrap liquidity before liquidity bonds were introduced. The protocol (between the treasury and what is being farmed on Onsen) now owns >83% of the pool. LP staking has gone from 80% of the liquidity to 16% today. However, we are still paying the same rewards as when we started.\n\nAbstract: This proposal seeks to lower the LP staking rewards through a phased approach. Rewards would be lowered from 90 OHM per day down to 45 OHM per day. Two schedules have been proposed for getting there:\n\nSchedule Option 1:\nDay 0: Proposal passes\nDay 1: Rewards from 90 -> 80\nDay 5: Rewards from 80 -> 65\nDay 9: Rewards from 65 -> 45\n\nSchedule Option 2:\nDay 0: Proposal passes\nDay 1: Rewards from 90 -> 80\nDay 5: Rewards from 80 -> 70\nDay 9: Rewards from 70 -> 60\nDay 14: Rewards from 60 -> 45\n\nMotivation: To utilize our funds efficiently, and to minimize the impact of a transition to lower rewards.\n\nFor: Option 1\nFor: Option 2\nAgainst: Do not lower rewards\n\n",

      "content": "Summary: We can launch bonds using DAI instead of SLP as payment to increase supply production efficiency.\n\nBackground: We launched liquidity bonds two weeks ago with the intent of accumulating and locking SLP tokens. Since then, we have accumulated over half the pool valued at nearly $7m. While we should not replace LP bonds by any means, we should think about supplementing them with DAI bonds to increase the rate of supply production.\n\nAbstract: Due to the way the treasury has to value LP tokens (using the Risk-Free Value equation), they are quite inefficient at producing supply. The treasury treats every $1 of liquidity as 3c for the purposes of backing tokens. With DAI bonds, every $1 given will be treated as $1. This means we can double the rate of supply production by diverting a mere 3% of bond demand. DAI bonds will also offer an alternative to smaller bonders or those who do not want to spend gas adding liquidity.\n\nMotivation: Increase the rate of supply production, build up bond market with a second (more constrained) option. LP and DAI bonds can and should be played against each other.\n\nAdditional Context:\nMedium post on DAI bonds: https://olympusdao.medium.com/dai-bonds-a-more-effective-sales-mechanism-c9a57586f1f7\nWhat is SalesLite: A contract we have been running for the past week which sells 4.2 OHM into the pool each epoch and mints new OHM (~ 10k per day) for stakers and the DAO. The downside of this approach is they are direct sales into the market.\n\nFor: Add DAI bonds and remove SalesLite\nFor: Add DAI bonds and phase out SalesLite\nFor: Add DAI bonds and keep SalesLite\nAgainst: Do not add DAI bonds",

      "content": "Summary: Let's adjust system parameters away from LP accumulation and back in favor of stakers.\n\nBackground: We have recently brought in over $8m through bonds. Total protocol owned liquidity now exceeds $10m. Total queued rewards are now greater than 300k OHM (nearly 4x current staking pool) - 380k if you include what the DAO-held LP will mint. This is more than 3 months runway, 50% more time than when we started nearly a month ago.\n\nAbstract:\n\nI believe we should:\nRaise the LP bond BCV from 100 to 300 (66% less capacity)\nTarget 16% of previous demand for dai bonds.\n\nThis should decrease supply output by 50%, but increase supply production by up to 400%.\n\nWe should also raise staking reward rate to target 250,000-350,000% APY instead of 100,000-150,000% (a 10-15% boost to the epoch rebase). This will make staking deflationary which should serve to correct some of the dilution experienced thus far. The market will readjust to supply as it now is, and then we can pick up into a new leg of larger treasury accumulation.\n\nIf this passes, a new proposal will be posed in one week to reassess. We should not remain in this state for too long - think of it as a cheat day.\n\nMotivation: To allow the market time to readjust to supply in a lower-inflation environment.\n\nFor: Make the adjustments\nAgainst: Keep the system as is",

      "content": "Summary: The DAO currently holds liquidity that can be used to mint new OHM. We should deposit that liquidity into the treasury instead of keeping it with the DAO.\n\nBackground: The DAO initialized the OHM-DAI liquidity pool when we launched last month. In total, it holds 1.1588 SLP; 0.8188 in the DAO wallet and 0.34 in the Onsen pool. That liquidity remained with the DAO due to concerns about rapidly increasing total supply (the entire LP share will mint approximately 80,000 OHM). However, supply has increased to the point that this is no longer concerning. A third is deployed into the Onsen rewards pool to earn $SUSHI, but the rest is unproductive.\n\nAbstract: We should deploy the unused 2/3 of the liquidity (0.818 SLP worth ~$1.6m) into the treasury and get it over with. This will lock it with the rest of the accumulated SLP and make our dashboard more accurate (it currently underestimates protocol-owned liquidity by 25%). This will mint 55,458 new OHM for the staking distributor.\n\nMotivation: Accurate data and correct separation of funds.\n\nFor: Deposit DAO-held liquidity (minus what's in Onsen) into the treasury, send new OHM to the distributor.\nFor: Deposit DAO-held liquidity (including what's in Onsen) into the treasury, send new OHM to the distributor.\nAgainst: Keep the liquidity with the DAO.",

      "content": "Summary:\nSeveral community members have brought up the idea of an OHM-ETH pool. They would like to provide liquidity for OHM, but they also don't want to lose exposure to ETH. This proposal suggests that we create an OHM-ETH pair and incentivize it with 0.01 OHM per block, and reduce current LP incentives on OHM-DAI to 0.01 OHM per block.\n\nBackground:\nMany believe that it would be easier for us to build liquidity with an ETH pair. This makes sense; few here are likely holding DAI on a regular basis. An ETH pair could allow us to build deeper liquidity by offering an alternative for LPs. Additionally, by adding this pool on Uniswap, we can reach a significant number of new traders and LPs.\n\nAbstract:\nIt may be worthwhile to divert additional resources toward this OHM-ETH pairing. Reducing pool 2 rewards for OHM-DAI from 0.0135 OHM/block to 0.01 OHM/block, and adding new pool 2 rewards for OHM-ETH for 0.01 OHM/block, would help conserve our resources and the majority of our existing liquidity while incentivizing the buildup of new liquidity.\n\nMotivation:\nTo add extra options for prospective LPs with an ETH pairing and broaden our addressable market with a listing on Uniswap.\n\nConcerns:\nArbitrage created by an ETH pair versus a DAI pair.\n\nFor:\n1. Add the OHM-ETH pair with 0.01 OHM/block incentives and reduce the OHM-DAI pair to 0.01 OHM/block\n\n2. Add the OHM-ETH pair with 0.01 OHM/block incentives and keep OHM-DAI incentives as is.\n\nAgainst:\n3. Do not add an OHM-ETH pair, keep incentives as is.",
