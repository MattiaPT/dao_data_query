      "content": "This is a test\n\nGrowing up, my parents used to play me Fleetwood Mac and “Everywhere” became one of my favorite songs. I wanted to recreate it and bring it into my own sound, in a euphoric, dance lane. I made this cover while I was traveling around London and it still feels like it holds that excitement of going somewhere new. The reaction to this song has been amazing, so I wanted to release it here for all of you. Let me know how this one hits <3\n\n \n![image](ipfs://bafybeiahzjqmyz6z4th4jmk7qsxb3jkto6levefizyjlceqz7ynihhfxw4)\n    ",
